It is a piece in\nits inception designed for, and in its making swayed by, the requirements\nof the little theatre stage. The one virtue which anybody anywhere could\nclaim for _The Jewel Merchants_ is the fact that it \"acts\" easily and\nrather effectively.\n\nAnd candor compels the admission forthwith that the presence of this\nanchoritic merit in the wilderness is hardly due to me. When circumstances\nand the Little Theatre League of Richmond combined to bully me into\ncontriving the dramatization of a short story called _Balthazar's\nDaughter_, I docilely converted this tale into a one-act play of which\nyou will find hereinafter no sentence. The comedy I wrote is now at one\nwith the lost dramaturgy of Pollio and of Posidippus, and is even less\nlikely ever to be resurrected for mortal auditors.\n\nIt read, I still think, well enough: I am certain that, when we came to\nrehearse, the thing did not \"act\" at all, and that its dialogue, whatever\nits other graces, had the defect of being unspeakable. So at each\nrehearsal we--by which inclusive pronoun I would embrace the actors and\nthe producing staff at large, and with especial (metaphorical) ardor Miss\nLouise Burleigh, who directed all--changed here a little, and there a\nlittle more; and shifted this bit, and deleted the other, and \"tried out\"\neverybody's suggestions generally, until we got at least the relief of\nwitnessing at each rehearsal a different play. And steadily my manuscript\nwas enriched with interlineations, to and beyond the verge of legibility,\nas steadily I substituted, for the speeches I had rewritten yesterday,\nthe speeches which the actor (having perfectly in mind the gist but not\nthe phrasing of what was meant) delivered naturally.\n\nThis process made, at all events, for what we in particular wanted,\nwhich was a play that the League could stage for half an evening's\nentertainment; but it left existent not a shred of the rhetorical\nfripperies which I had in the beginning concocted, and it made of the\nactual first public performance a collaboration with almost as many\ncontributing authors as though the production had been a musical comedy.\n\nAnd if only fate had gifted me with an exigent conscience and a turn for\noratory, I would, I like to think, have publicly confessed, at that first\npublic performance, to all those tributary clarifying rills to the play's\nprogress: but, as it was, vainglory combined with an aversion to\n\"speech-making\" to compel a taciturn if smirking acceptance of the\ncurtain-call with which an indulgent audience flustered the nominal author\nof _The Jewel Merchants_.... Now, in any case, it is due my collaborators\nto tell you that _The Jewel Merchants_ has amply fulfilled the purpose\nof its makers by being enacted to considerable applause,--and is a\npleasure to add that this _succ\u00e8s d'estime_ was very little chargeable to\nanything which I contributed to the play.\n\nFor another matter, I would here confess that _The Jewel Merchants_,\nin addition to its \"literary\" deficiencies, lacks moral fervor. It will,\nI trust, corrupt no reader irretrievably, to untraversable leagues beyond\nthe last hope of redemption: but, even so, it is a frankly unethical\nperformance. You must accept this resuscitated trio, if at all, very much\nas they actually went about Tuscany, in long ago discarded young flesh,\nwhen the one trait everywhere common to their milieu was the absence of\nany moral excitement over such-and-such an action's being or not being\n\"wicked.\" This phenomenon of Renaissance life, as lived in Italy in\nparticular, has elsewhere been discussed time and again, and I lack here\nthe space, and the desire, either to explain or to apologize for the era's\ndelinquencies. I would merely indicate that this point of conduct is the\nfulcrum of _The Jewel Merchants_.\n\nThe play presents three persons, to any one of whom the committing of\nmurder or theft or adultery or any other suchlike interdicted feat, is\njust the risking of the penalty provided against the breaking of that\nespecial law if you have the vile luck to be caught at it: and this to\nthem is all that \"wickedness\" can mean. We nowadays are encouraged to\nthink differently: but such dear privileges do not entitle us to ignore\nthe truth that had any of these three advanced a dissenting code of\nconduct, it would, in the time and locality, have been in radical\nirreverence of the best-thought-of tenets. There was no generally\nrecognized criminality in crime, but only a perceptible risk. So must\nthis trio thriftily adhere to the accepted customs of their era, and\nregard an infraction of the Decalogue (for an instance) very much as we\ntoday look on a violation of our prohibition enactments.\n\nIn fact, we have accorded to the Eighteenth Amendment almost exactly the\nstatus then reserved for Omnipotence. You found yourself confronted by\noccasionally enforced if obviously unreasonable supernal statutory\ndecrees, which every one broke now and then as a matter of convenience:\nand every now and then, also, somebody was caught and punished, either in\nthis world or in the next, without his ill-fortune's involving any\ndisgrace or particular reprehension. As has been finely said,\nrighteousness and sinfulness were for the while \"in strange and dreadful\npeace with each other. The wicked man did not dislike virtue, nor the good\nman vice: the villain could admire a saint, and the saint could excuse a\nvillain, in things which we often shrink from repeating, and sometimes\nrecoil from believing.\"\n\nSuch was the sixteenth-century Tuscan view of \"wickedness.\" I have\nendeavored to reproduce it without comment.\n\nSo much of ink and paper and typography may be needed, I fear, to remind\nyou, in a more exhortatory civilization, that Graciosa is really, by all\nthe standards of her day, a well reared girl. To the prostitution of her\nbody, whether with or without the assistance of an ecclesiastically\nacquired husband, she looks forward as unconcernedly as you must by\nordinary glance out of your front window, to face a vista so familiar\nthat the discovery of any change therein would be troubling. Meanwhile\nshe wishes this sorrow-bringing Eglamore assassinated, as the obvious,\nthe most convenient, and indeed the only way of getting rid of him: and\ntoward the end of the play, alike for her and Guido, the presence of a\ncorpse in her garden is merely an inconvenience without any touch of the\ngruesome. Precautions have, of course, to be taken to meet the emergency\nwhich has arisen: but in the dead body of a man _per se_, the lovers can\ndetect nothing more appalling, or more to be shrunk from, than would be\napparent if the lifeless object in the walkway were a dead flower. The\nthing ought to be removed, if only in the interest of tidiness, but there\nis no call to make a pother over it.\n\nAs for our Guido, he is best kept conformable to modern tastes, I suspect,\nby nobody's prying too closely into the earlier relations between the\nDuke and his handsome minion. The insistently curious may resort to\nhistory to learn at what price the favors of Duke Alessandro were secured\nand retained: it is no part of the play.\n\nAbove all, though, I must remind you that the Duke is unspurred by\nmalevolence. A twinge of jealousy there may be, just at first, to find his\npampered Eglamore so far advanced in the good graces of this pretty girl,\nbut that is hardly important. Thereafter the Duke is breaking no law,\nfor the large reason that his preference in any matter is the only law\nthus far divulged to him. As concerns the man and the girl he discovers on\nthis hill-top, they, in common with all else in Tuscany, are possessions\nof Duke Alessandro's. They can raise no question as to how he \"ought\" to\ndeal with them, for to your chattels, whether they be your finger rings or\nyour subjects or your pomatum pots or the fair quires whereon you indite\nyour verses, you cannot rationally he said to \"owe\" anything.... No, the\nDuke is but a spirited lad in quest of amusement: and Guido and Graciosa\nare the playthings with which, on this fine sunlit morning, he attempts to\ndivert himself.\n\nThis much being granted--and confessed,--we let the play begin.\n\n_Dumbarton Grange,_\n_June, 1921_\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[\"Alessandro de Medici is generally styled by the Italian authors the\nfirst duke of Florence; but in this they are not strictly accurate. His\ntitle of duke was derived from Citt\u00e0, or Civit\u00e0 di Penna, and had been\nassumed by him several years before he obtained the direction of the\nFlorentine state. It must also be observed, that, after the evasion of\nEglamore, Duke Alessandro did not, as Robertson observes, 'enjoy the\nsame absolute dominion as his family have retained to the present times,'\n(Hist. Charles V. book v.) he being only declared chief or prince of the\nrepublic, and his authority being in some measure counteracted or\nrestrained by two councils chosen from the citizens, for life, one of\nwhich consisted of forty-eight, and the other of two hundred members.\n(Varchi, Storia Fior. p. 497: Nerli, Com. lib. xi. pp. 257, 264.)\"]\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n            THE JEWEL MERCHANTS\n\n    _\"Diamente n\u00e8 smeraldo n\u00e8 zaffino.\"_\n\n\nOriginally produced by the Little Theatre League of Richmond, Virginia,\nat the Binford High School Auditorium, 22 February, 1921.\n\n              _Original Cast_\n\nGRACIOSA...........................Elinor Fry\n       Daughter of Balthazar Valori\n\nGUIDO........................Roderick Maybee\n             A jewel merchant\n\nALESSANDRO DE MEDICI.........Francis F.

The garden is walled.\nThere is a shrine in the wall: the tortured figure upon the crucifix is\nconspicuous. To the right stands a rather high-backed stone bench: by\nmounting from the seat to the top of the bench it is possible to scale\nthe wall. To the left a crimson pennant on a pole shows against the sky.\nThe period is 1533, and a few miles southward the Florentines, after three\nyears of formally recognizing Jesus Christ as the sole lord and king of\nFlorence, have lately altered matters as profoundly as was possible by\nelecting Alessandro de Medici to be their Duke._\n\n_GRACIOSA is seated upon the bench, with a lute. The girl is, to our\nmodern taste, very quaintly dressed in gold-colored satin, with a short\ntight bodice, cut square and low at the neck, and with long full skirts.\nWhen she stands erect, her preposterous \"flowing\" sleeves, lined with\nsky blue, reach to the ground. Her blonde hair, of which she has a great\ndeal, is braided, in the intricate early sixteenth fashion, under a\njeweled cap and a veil the exact color of this hair._\n\n_There is a call. Smiling, GRACIOSA answers this call by striking her\nlute. She pats straight her hair and gown, and puts aside the instrument.\nGUIDO appears at the top of the wall. All you can see of the handsome\nyoung fellow, in this posture, is that he wears a green skull-cap and a\ndark blue smock, the slashed sleeves of which are lined with green._\n\nGUIDO\nAh, madonna....\n\nGRACIOSA\nWelcome, Ser Guido. Your journey has been brief.\n\nGUIDO\nIt has not seemed brief to me.\n\nGRACIOSA\nWhy, it was only three days ago you told me it would be a fortnight\nbefore you came this way again.\n\nGUIDO\nYes, but I did not then know that each day spent apart from you, Madonna\nGraciosa, would be a century in passing.\n\nGRACIOSA\nDear me, but your search must have been desperate!\n\nGUIDO\n(_Who speaks, as almost always hereinafter, with sober enjoyment of the\nfact that he is stating the exact truth unintelligibly._) Yes, my search\nis desperate.\n\nGRACIOSA\nDid you find gems worthy of your search?\n\nGUIDO\nVery certainly, since at my journey's end I find Madonna Graciosa, the\nchief jewel of Tuscany.\n\nGRACIOSA\nSuch compliments, Guido, make your speech less like a merchant's than a\ncourtier's.\n\nGUIDO\nAh, well, to balance that, you will presently find courtiers in Florence\nwho will barter for you like merchants. May I descend?\n\nGRACIOSA\nYes, if you have something of interest to show me.\n\nGUIDO\nAm I to be welcomed merely for the sake of my gems? You were more\ngracious, you were more beautifully like your lovely name, on the\nfortunate day that I first encountered you ... only six weeks ago, and\nonly yonder, where the path crosses the highway. But now that I esteem\nmyself your friend, you greet me like a stranger. You do not even invite\nme into your garden. I much prefer the manner in which you told me the\nway to the inn when I was an unknown passer-by. And yet your pennant\npromised greeting.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_With the smile of an exceptionally candid angel._) Ah, Guido, I flew\nit the very minute the boy from the inn brought me your message!\n\nGUIDO\nNow, there is the greeting I had hoped for! But how do you escape your\nfather's watch so easily?\n\nGRACIOSA\nMy father has no need to watch me in this lonely hill castle. Ever since\nI can remember I have wandered at will in the forest. My father knows that\nto me every path is as familiar as one of the corridors in his house; and\nin no one of them did I ever meet anybody except charcoal-burners, and\nsometimes a nun from the convent, and--oh, yes!--you. But descend, friend\nGuido.\n\n_Thus encouraged, GUIDO descends from the top of the wall to the top of\nthe bench, and thence, via its seat, to the ground. You are thereby\nenabled to discover that his nether portions are clad in dark blue tights\nand soft leather shoes with pointed turned-up toes. It is also noticeable\nthat he carries a jewel pack of purple, which, when opened, reveals an\norange lining._\n\nGUIDO\n(_With as much irony as the pleasure he takes in being again with this\ndear child permits._) That \"Oh, yes, you!\" is a very fitting reward for\nmy devotion. For I find that nowadays I travel about the kingdom buying\njewels less for my patrons at court than for the pleasure of having your\neyes appraise them, and smile at me.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_With the condescension of a great lady._) Guido, you have in point of\nfact been very kind to me, and very amusing, too, in my loneliness on\nthe top of this hill. (_Drawing back the sleeve from her left arm, she\nreveals the trinket there._) See, here is the turquoise bracelet I had\nfrom you the second time you passed. I wear it always--secretly.\n\nGUIDO\nThat is wise, for the turquoise is a talisman. They say that the woman\nwho wears a turquoise is thereby assured of marrying the person whom she\nprefers.\n\nGRACIOSA\nI do not know about that, nor do I expect to have much choice as to what\nrich nobleman marries me, but I know that I love this bracelet--\n\nGUIDO\nIn fact, they are handsome stones.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBecause it reminds me constantly of the hours which I have spent here\nwith my lute--\n\nGUIDO\nOh, with your lute!\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd with your pack of lovely jewels--\n\nGUIDO\nYes, to be sure! with my jewels.\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd with you.\n\nGUIDO\nThere is again my gracious lady. Now, in reward for that, you shall\nfeast your eyes.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_All eagerness._) And what have you to-day?\n\n_GUIDO opens his pack. She bends above it with hands outstretched._\n\nGUIDO\n(_Taking out a necklace._) For one thing, pearls, black pearls, set with\na clasp of emeralds. See! They will become you.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Taking them, pressing them to her cheek._) How cool! But I--poor child\nof a poor noble--I cannot afford such.\n\nGUIDO\nOh, I did not mean to offer them to you to-day. No, this string is\nintended for the Duke's favorite, Count Eglamore.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Stiffening._) Count Eglamore! These are for him?\n\nGUIDO\nFor Count Eglamore.\n\nGRACIOSA\nHas the upstart such taste?\n\nGUIDO\nIf it be taste to appreciate pearls, then the Duke's chief officer has\nexcellent taste. He seeks them far and wide. He will be very generous in\npaying for this string.\n\n_GRACIOSA drops the pearls, in which she no longer delights. She returns\nto the bench, and sits down and speaks with a sort of disappointment._\n\nGRACIOSA\nI am sorry to learn that this Eglamore is among your patrons.\n\nGUIDO\n(_Still half engrossed by the contents of his pack. The man loves jewels\nequally for their value and their beauty._) Oh, the nobles complain of\nhim, but we merchants have no quarrel with Eglamore. He buys too lavishly.\n\nGRACIOSA\nDo you think only of buying and selling, Guido?\n\nGUIDO\nIt is a pursuit not limited to us who frankly live by sale and purchase.\nCount Eglamore, for example, knows that men may be bought as readily as\nmerchandise. It is one reason why he is so hated--by the unbought.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Irritated by the title._) Count Eglamore, indeed! I ask in my prayers\nevery night that some honest gentleman may contrive to cut the throat of\nthis abominable creature.\n\nGUIDO\n(_His hand going to his throat._) You pray too much, madonna. Even very\npious people ought to be reasonable.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Rising from the bench._) Have I not reason to hate the man who killed\nmy kinsman?\n\nGUIDO\n(_Rising from his gems._) The Marquis of Cibo conspired, or so the court\njudged--\n\nGRACIOSA\nI know nothing of the judgment. But it was this Eglamore who discovered\nthe plot, if there indeed was any plot, and who sent my cousin Cibo to\na death--(_pointing to the shrine_)--oh, to a death as horrible as that.\nSo I hate him.\n\nGUIDO\nYet you have never even seen him, I believe?\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd it would be better for him never to see me or any of my kin. My\nfather, my uncles and my cousins have all sworn to kill him--\n\nGUIDO\nSo I have gathered. They remain among the unbought.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Returning, sits upon the bench, and speaks regretfully._) But they\nhave never any luck. Cousin Pietro contrived to have a beam dropped on\nEglamore's head, and it missed him by not half a foot--\n\nGUIDO\nAh, yes, I remember.\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd Cousin Georgio stabbed him in the back one night, but the coward had\non chain-armor under his finery--\n\nGUIDO\nI remember that also.\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd Uncle Lorenzo poisoned his soup, but a pet dog got at it first. That\nwas very unfortunate.\n\nGUIDO\nYes, the dog seemed to think so, I remember.\n\nGRACIOSA\nHowever, perseverance is always rewarded. So I still hope that one or\nanother of my kinsmen will contrive to kill this Eglamore before I go to\ncourt.\n\nGUIDO\n(_Sits at her feet._) Has my Lord Balthazar yet set a day for that\npresentation?\n\nGRACIOSA\nNot yet.\n\nGUIDO\nI wish to have this Eglamore's accounts all settled by that date.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut in three months, Guido, I shall be sixteen. My sisters went to court\nwhen they were sixteen.\n\nGUIDO\nIn fact, a noble who is not rich cannot afford to continue supporting a\ndaughter who is salable in marriage.\n\nGRACIOSA\nNo, of course not. (_She speaks in the most matter-of-fact tone possible.\nThen, more impulsively, the girl slips down from the bench, and sits by\nhim on the around._) Do you think I shall make as good a match as my\nsisters, Guido? Do you think some great rich nobleman will marry me very\nsoon? And shall I like the court! What shall I see there?\n\nGUIDO\nMarvels. I think--yes, I am afraid that you will like them.\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd Duke Alessandro--shall I like him?\n\nGUIDO\nFew courtiers have expressed dislike of him in my presence.\n\nGRACIOSA\nDo you like him? Does he too buy lavishly?\n\nGUIDO\nEh, madonna! some day, when you have seen his jewels--\n\nGRACIOSA\nOh! I shall see them when I go to court?\n\nGUIDO\nYes, he will show them to you, I think, without fail, for the Duke loves\nbeauty in all its forms. So he will take pleasure in confronting the\nbrightness of your eyes with the brightness of the four kinds of sapphires,\nof the twelve kinds of rubies, and of many extraordinary pearls--\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_With eyes shining, and lips parted._) Oh!\n\nGUIDO\nAnd you will see his famous emerald necklace, and all his diamonds, and\nhis huge turquoises, which will make you ashamed of your poor talisman--\n\nGRACIOSA\nHe will show all these jewels to me!\n\nGUIDO\n(_Looking at her, and still smiling thoughtfully._) He will show you the\nvery finest of his gems, assuredly. And then, worse still, he will be\nmaking verses in your honor.\n\nGRACIOSA\nIt would be droll to have a great duke making songs about me!\n\nGUIDO\nIt is a preposterous feature of Duke Alessandro's character that he is\nalways making songs about some beautiful thing or another.\n\nGRACIOSA\nSuch strange songs, Guido! I was singing over one of them just before\nyou came,--\n\n    Let me have dames and damsels richly clad\n      To feed and tend my mirth,\n    Singing by day and night to make me glad--\n\nBut I could not quite understand it. Are his songs thought good?\n\nGUIDO\nThe songs of a reigning duke are always good.\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd is he as handsome as people report?\n\nGUIDO\nTastes differ, of course--\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd is he--?\n\nGUIDO\nI have a portrait of the Duke. It does not, I think, unduly flatter him.\nWill you look at it?\n\nGRACIOSA\nYes, yes!\n\nGUIDO\n(_Drawing out a miniature on a chain._) Here is the likeness.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut how should you--?\n\nGUIDO\n(_Seeing her surprise._) Oh, it was a gift to me from his highness for a\nspecial service I did him, and as such must be treasured.\n\nGRACIOSA\nPerhaps, then, I shall see yon at court, Messer Guido, who are the friend\nof princes?\n\nGUIDO\nIf you do, I ask only that in noisy Florence you remember this quiet\ngarden.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Looks at him silently, then glances at the portrait. She speaks with\nevident disappointment._) Is this the Duke?\n\nGUIDO\nYou may see his arms on it, and on the back his inscription.\n\nGRACIOSA\nYes, but--(_looking at the portrait again_)--but ... he is ... so ...\n\nGUIDO\nYou are astonished at his highness' coloring? That he inherits from his\nmother. She was, you know, a blackamoor.\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd my sisters wrote me he was like a god!\n\nGUIDO\nSuch observations are court etiquette.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_With an outburst of disgust._) Take it back! Though how can you bear to\nlook at it, far less to have it touching you! And only yesterday I was\nangry because I had not seen the Duke riding past!\n\nGUIDO\nSeen him! here! riding past!\n\nGRACIOSA\nOld Ursula told me that the Duke had gone by with twenty men, riding down\ntoward the convent at the border. And I flung my sewing-bag straight at\nher head because she had not called me.\n\nGUIDO\nThat was idle gossip, I fancy. The Duke rarely rides abroad without\nmy--(_he stops_)--without my lavish patron Eglamore, the friend of all\nhonest merchants.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut that abominable Eglamore may have been with him. I heard nothing to\nthe contrary.\n\nGUIDO\nTrue, madonna, true. I had forgotten you did not see them.\n\nGRACIOSA\nNo. What is he like, this Eglamore? Is he as appalling to look at as the\nDuke?\n\nGUIDO\nMadonna! but wise persons do not apply such adjectives to dukes. And wise\npersons do not criticize Count Eglamore's appearance, either, now that\nEglamore is indispensable to the all-powerful Duke of Florence.\n\nGRACIOSA\nIndispensable?\n\nGUIDO\nIt is thanks to the Eglamore whom you hate that the Duke has ample leisure\nto indulge in recreations which are reputed to be--curious.\n\nGRACIOSA\nI do not understand you, Guido.\n\nGUIDO\nThat is perhaps quite as well. (_Attempting to explain as much as is\ndecently expressible._) To be brief, madonna, business annoys the Duke.\n\nGRACIOSA\nWhy?\n\nGUIDO\nIt interferes with the pursuit of all the beautiful things he asks for\nin that song.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut how does that make Eglamore indispensable?\n\nGUIDO\nEglamore is an industrious person who affixes seals, and signs treaties,\nand musters armies, and collects revenues, upon the whole, quite as\nefficiently as Alessandro would be capable of doing these things.\n\nGRACIOSA\nSo Duke Alessandro merely makes verses?\n\nGUIDO\nAnd otherwise amuses himself as his inclinations prompt, while Eglamore\nrules Tuscany--and the Tuscans are none the worse off on account of it.\n(_He rises, and his hand goes to the dagger at his belt._) But is not\nthat a horseman?\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_She too has risen, and is now standing on the bench, looking over the\nwall._) A solitary rider, far down by the convent, so far away that he\nseems hardly larger than a scarlet dragon-fly.\n\nGUIDO\nI confess I wish to run no risk of being found here, by your respected\nfather or by your ingenious cousins and uncles.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_She turns, but remains standing upon the bench._) I think your Duke is\nmuch more dangerous looking than any of them. Heigho! I can quite foresee\nthat I shall never fall in love with this Duke.\n\nGUIDO\nA prince has means to overcome all obstacles.\n\nGRACIOSA\nNo. It is unbefitting and a little cowardly for Duke Alessandro to shirk\nthe duties of his station for verse-making and eternal pleasure-seeking.\nNow if I were Duke--\n\nGUIDO\nWhat would you do?\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Posturing a little as she stands upon the bench._) If I were duke?\nOh ... I would grant my father a pension ... and I would have Eglamore\nhanged ... and I would purchase a new gown of silvery green--\n\nGUIDO\nIn which you would be very ravishingly beautiful.\n\n_His tone has become rather ardent, and he is now standing nearer to her\nthan the size of the garden necessitates. So GRACIOSA demurely steps\ndown from the bench, and sits at the far end._\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd that is all I can think of. What would you do if you were duke,\nMesser Guido?\n\nGUIDO\n(_Who is now sitting beside her at closer quarters than the length of the\nbench quite strictly demands._) I? What would I do if I were a great lord\ninstead of a tradesman! (_Softly._) I think you know the answer, madonna.\n\nGRACIOSA\nOh, you would make me your duchess, of course. That is quite understood.\nBut I was speaking seriously, Guido.\n\nGUIDO\nAnd is it not a serious matter that a pedler of crystals should have dared\nto love a nobleman's daughter?\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Delighted._) This is the first I have heard of it.\n\nGUIDO\nBut you are perfectly right. It is not a serious matter. That I worship\nyou is an affair which does not seriously concern any person save me in\nany way whatsoever. Yet I think that knowledge of the fact would put your\nfather to the trouble of sharpening his dagger.\n\nGRACIOSA\nYe-es. But not even Father would deny that you were showing excellent\ntaste.\n\nGUIDO\nIndeed, I am not certain that I do worship you; for in order to adore\nwhole-heartedly the idolater must believe his idol to be perfect.\n(_Taking her hand._) Now your nails are of an ugly shape, like that of\nlittle fans. Your nose is nothing to boast of. And your mouth is too\nlarge. I do not admire these faults, for faults they are undoubtedly--\n\nGRACIOSA\nDo they make me very ugly? I know that I have not a really good mouth,\nGuido, but do you think it is positively repulsive?\n\nGUIDO\nNo.... Then, too, I know that you are vain and self-seeking, and look\nforward contentedly to the time when your father will transfer his\nownership of your physical attractions to that nobleman who offers the\nhighest price for them.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut we daughters of the poor Valori are compelled to marry--suitably. We\nhave only the choice between that and the convent yonder.\n\nGUIDO\nThat is true, and nobody disputes it. Still, you participate in a\nmonstrous bargain, and I would prefer to have you exhibit distaste for it.\n\n_Bending forward, GUIDO draws from his jewel pack the string of pearls,\nand this he moodily contemplates, in order to evince his complete\ndisinterestedness. The pose has its effect. GRACIOSA looks at him for a\nmoment, rises, draws a deep breath, and speaks with a sort of humility._\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd to what end, Guido? What good would weeping do?\n\nGUIDO\n(_Smiling whimsically._) I am afraid that men do not always love\naccording to the strict laws of logic. (_He drops the pearls, and,\nrising, follows her._) I desire your happiness above all things, yet to\nsee you so abysmally untroubled by anything which troubles me is--another\nmatter.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut I am not untroubled, Guido.\n\nGUIDO\nNo?\n\nGRACIOSA\nNo. (_Rather tremulously._) Sometimes I sit here dreading my life at\ncourt. I want never to leave my father's bleak house. I fear that I may\nnot like the man who offers the highest price for me. And it seems as\nif the court were a horrible painted animal, dressed in bright silks, and\nshining with jewels, and waiting to devour me.\n\n_Beyond the wall appears a hat of scarlet satin with a divided brim,\nwhich, rising, is revealed to surmount the head of an extraordinarily\nswarthy person, to whose dark skin much powder has only loaned the hue of\ndeath: his cheeks, however, are vividly carmined. This is all that the\naudience can now see of the young DUKE of FLORENCE, whose proximity the\ntwo in the garden are just now too much engrossed to notice._\n\n_The DUKE looks from one to the other. His eyes narrow, his teeth are\ndisplayed in a wide grin; he now understands the situation. He lowers his\nhead as GRACIOSA moves._\n\nGRACIOSA\nNo, I am not untroubled. For I cannot fathom you, and that troubles me. I\nam very fond of you--and yet I do not trust you.\n\nGUIDO\nYou know that I love you.\n\nGRACIOSA\nYou tell me so. It pleases me to have you say it--\n\nGUIDO\nMadonna is candid this morning.\n\nGRACIOSA\nYes, I am candid. It does please me. And I know that for the sake of\nseeing me you endanger your life, for if my father heard of our meetings\nhere he would have you killed.\n\nGUIDO\nWould I incur such risks without caring?\n\nGRACIOSA\nNo,--and yet, somehow, I do not believe it is altogether for me that you\ncare.\n\n_The DUKE laughs. GUIDO starts, half drawing his dagger. GRACIOSA turns\nwith an instinctive gesture of seeking protection. The DUKE'S head and\nshoulders appear above the wall._\n\nTHE DUKE\nAnd you will find, my friend, that the most charming women have just these\nawkward intuitions.\n\n_The DUKE ascends the wall, while the two stand motionless and silent.\nWhen he is on top of the wall, GUIDO, who now remembers that omnipotence\nperches there, makes haste to serve it, and obsequiously assists the DUKE\nto descend. The DUKE then comes well forward, in smiling meditation, and\nhands first his gloves, then his scarlet cloak (which you now perceive to\nbe lined with ermine and sable in four stripes) to GUIDO, who takes them\nas a servant would attend his master._\n\n_The removal of this cloak reveals the DUKE to be clad in a scarlet satin\ndoublet, which has a high military collar and sleeves puffed with black.\nHis tights also are of scarlet, and he wears shining soft black\nriding-boots. Jewels glisten at his neck. About his middle, too, there is\na metallic gleaming, for he is equipped with a noticeably long sword and\na dagger. Such is the personage who now addresses himself more explicitly\nto GRACIOSA._\n\nTHE DUKE\n(_Sitting upon the bench, very much at his ease while the others stand\nuncomfortably before him._) Yes, madonna, I suspect that Eglamore here\ncares greatly for the fact that you are Balthazar Valori's daughter, and\ncousin to the late Marquis of Cibo.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Just in bewilderment._) Eglamore!\n\nTHE DUKE\nFor Cibo left many kinsmen. These still resent the circumstance that\nthe matching of his wits against Eglamore's wits earned for Cibo an\nunpleasantly public death-bed. So they pursue their feud against Eglamore\nwith vexatious industry. And Eglamore goes about in hourly apprehension\nof another falling beam, another knife-thrust in the back, or another\nplate of poison.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_She comprehends now._) Eglamore!\n\nTHE DUKE\n(_Who is pleased alike by Eglamore's neat plan and by his own cleverness\nin unriddling it._) But if rich Eglamore should make a stolen match with\nyou, your father--good thrifty man!--could be appeased without much\ntrouble. Your cousins, those very angry but penniless Valori, would not\nstay over-obdurate to a kinsman who had at his disposal so many pensions\nand public offices. Honor would permit a truce with their new cousin\nEglamore, a truce very profitable to everybody.\n\nGRACIOSA\nHe said they must be bought somehow!\n\nTHE DUKE\nYes, Eglamore could bind them all to his interest within ten days. All\ncould be bought at a stroke by marrying you. And Eglamore would be rid\nof the necessity of sleeping in chain-armor. Have I not unraveled the\nscheme correctly, Eglamore?\n\nGUIDO\n(_Smiling and deferential._) Your highness was never lacking in\npenetration.\n\n_GRACIOSA, at this, turns puzzled from one man to the other._\n\nGRACIOSA\nAre you--?\n\nTHE DUKE\nI am Alessandro de Medici, madonna.\n\nGRACIOSA\nThe Duke!\n\nTHE DUKE\nA sadly neglected prince, who wondered over the frequent absences of his\nchief counselor, and secretly set spies upon him. Eglamore here will\nattest as much--(_As GRACIOSA draws away from GUIDO_)--or if you cannot\nbelieve Eglamore any longer in anything, I shall have other witnesses\nwithin the half-hour. Yes, my twenty cut-throats are fetching back for me\na brace of nuns from the convent yonder. I can imagine that, just now, my\ncut-throats will be in your opinion more trustworthy witnesses than is\npoor Eglamore. And my stout knaves will presently assure you that I am\nthe Duke.\n\nGUIDO\n(_Suavely._) It happens that not a moment ago we were admiring your\nhighness' portrait.\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd so you are Count Eglamore. That is very strange. So it was the hand\nof Eglamore (_rubbing her hands as if to clean them_) that I touched just\nnow. I thought it was the hand of my friend Guido. But I forget. There is\nno Guido. You are Eglamore. It is strange you should have been capable of\nso much wickedness, for to me you seem only a smirking and harmless\nlackey.\n\n_The DUKE is watching as if at a play. He is aesthetically pleased by the\ngirl's anguish. GUIDO winces. As GRACIOSA begins again to speak, they turn\nfacing her, so that to the audience the faces of both men are invisible._\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd it was you who detected--so you said--the Marquis of Cibo's\nconspiracy. Tebaldeo was my cousin, Count Eglamore. I loved him. We were\nreared together. We used to play here in this garden. I remember how\nTebaldeo once fetched me a wren's nest from that maple yonder. I stood\njust here. I was weeping, because I was afraid he would fall. If he had\nfallen, if he had been killed then, it would have been the luckier for\nhim. They say that he conspired. I do not know. I only know that by your\norders, Count Eglamore, my playmate Tebaldeo was fastened to a cross, like\nthat (_pointing to the shrine_). I know that his arms and legs were each\nbroken in two places with an iron bar. I know that this cross was then set\nupon a pivot, so that it turned slowly. I know that my dear Tebaldeo died\nvery slowly in the sunlit marketplace, while the cross turned, and turned,\nand turned. I know this was a public holiday; the shopkeepers took holiday\nto watch him die, the boy who fetched me a wren's nest from yonder maple.\nAnd I know that you are Eglamore, who ordered these things done.\n\nGUIDO\nI gave orders for the Marquis of Cibo's execution, as was the duty of my\noffice. I did not devise the manner of his punishment. The punishment for\nCibo's crime was long ago fixed by our laws. All who attack the Duke's\nperson must die thus.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Waves his excuses aside._) And then you plan this masquerade. You plan\nto make me care for you so greatly that even when I know you to be Count\nEglamore I must still care for you. You plan to marry me, so as to placate\nTebaldeo's kinsmen, so as to leave them--in your huckster's phrase--no\nlonger unbought. It was a fine bold stroke of policy, I know, to use me\nas a stepping-stone to safety. But was it fair to me?\n\nGUIDO\nGraciosa ... you shame me--\n\nGRACIOSA\nLook you, Count Eglamore, I was only a child, playing here, alone, and\nnot unhappy. Oh, was it fair, was it worth while to match your skill\nagainst my ignorance?\n\nTHE DUKE\nFie, Donna Graciosa, you must not be too harsh with Eglamore--\n\nGRACIOSA\nThink how unhappy I would be if even now I loved you, and how I would\nloathe myself!\n\nTHE DUKE\nIt is his nature to scheme, and he weaves his plots as inevitably as the\nspider does her web--\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut I am getting angry over nothing. Nothing has happened except that\nI have dreamed--of a Guido. And there is no Guido. There is only an\nEglamore, a lackey in attendance upon his master.\n\nTHE DUKE\nBelieve me, it is wiser to forget this clever lackey--as I do--except when\nthere is need of his services. I think that you have no more need to\nconsider him--\n\n_He takes the girl's hand. GRACIOSA now looks at him as though seeing him\nfor the first time. She is vaguely frightened by this predatory beast, but\nin the main her emotion is as yet bewilderment._\n\nTHE DUKE\nFor you are very beautiful, Graciosa. You are as slim as a lily, and\nmore white. Your eyes are two purple mirrors in each of which I see a\ntiny image of Duke Alessandro. (_GUIDO takes a step forward, and the DUKE\nnow addresses him affably._) Those nuns they are fetching me are big\nhigh-colored wenches with cheeks like apples. It is not desirable that\nwomen should be so large. Such women do not inspire a poet. Women should\nbe little creatures that fear you. They should have thin plaintive voices,\nand in shrinking from you should be as slight to the touch as a cobweb.\nIt is not possible to draw inspiration from a woman's beauty unless you\ncomprehend how easy it would be to murder her.\n\nGUIDO\n(_Softly, without expression._) God, God!\n\n_The DUKE looks with delight at GRACIOSA, who stands bewildered and\nchildlike._\n\nTHE DUKE\nYou fear me, do you not, Graciosa? Your hand is soft and cold as the skin\nof a viper. When I touch it you shudder. I am very tired of women who\nlove me, of women who are infatuated by my beauty. You, I can see, are not\ninfatuated. To you my touch will always be a martyrdom, you will always\nloathe me. And therefore I shall not weary of you for a long while,\nbecause the misery and the helplessness of my lovely victim will incite\nme to make very lovely verses.\n\n_He draws her to the bench, sitting beside her._\n\nTHE DUKE\nYes, Graciosa, you will inspire me. Your father shall have all the wealth\nand state that even his greedy imaginings can devise, so long as you can\ncontrive to loathe me. We will find you a suitable husband--say, in\nEglamore here. You shall have flattery and titles, gold and fine glass,\nsoft stuffs and superb palaces and many lovely jewels--\n\n_The DUKE glances down at the pedler's pack._\n\nTHE DUKE\nBut Eglamore also has been wooing you with jewels. You must see mine,\ndear Graciosa.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Without expression._) Count Eglamore said that I must.\n\nTHE DUKE\n(_Raises the necklace, and lets it drop contemptuously._) Oh, not such\ntrumpery as this. I have in Florence gems which have not their fellows\nanywhere, gems which have not even a name, and the value of which is\nincalculable. I have jewels engendered by the thunder, jewels taken from\nthe heart of the Arabian deer. I have jewels cut from the brain of a toad,\nand from the eyes of serpents. I have jewels which are authentically known\nto have fallen from the moon. Well, we will select the rarest, and have a\npair of slippers encrusted with them, and in these slippers you shall\ndance for me, in a room that I know of--\n\nGUIDO\n(_Without moving._) Highness--!\n\nTHE DUKE\nIt will all be very amusing, for I think that she is now quite innocent,\nas pure as the high angels. Yes, it will be diverting to make her as I am.\nIt will be an atrocious action that will inspire me to write lovelier\nverses than even I have ever written.\n\nGUIDO\nShe is a child--\n\nTHE DUKE\nYes, yes, a frightened child who cannot speak, who stays as still as a\nlark that has been taken in a snare. Why, neither of her sisters can\ncompare with this, and, besides, the elder one had a quite ugly mole upon\nher thigh--But that old rogue Balthazar Valori has a real jewel to offer,\nthis time. Well, I will buy it.\n\nGUIDO\nHighness, I love this child--\n\nTHE DUKE\nAh, then you cannot ever be her husband. You would have suited otherwise.\nBut we will find some other person of discretion--\n\n_For a moment the two men regard each other in silence. The DUKE becomes\naware that he is being opposed. His brows contract a little, but he rises\nfrom the bench rather as if in meditation than in anger. Then GUIDO drops\nthe cloak and gloves he has been holding until this. His lackeyship is\nover._\n\nGUIDO\nNo!\n\nTHE DUKE\nMy friend, some long-faced people say you made a beast of me--\n\nGUIDO\nNo, I will not have it.\n\nTHE DUKE\nSo do you beware lest the beast turn and rend you.\n\nGUIDO\nI have never been too nice to profit by your vices. I have taken my\nthrifty toll of abomination. I have stood by contentedly, not urging you\non, yet never trying to stay you as you waded deeper and ever deeper into\nthe filth of your debaucheries, because meanwhile you left me so much\npower.\n\nTHE DUKE\nWould you reshape your handiwork more piously? Come, come, man, be content\nwith it as I am. And be content with the kingdom I leave you to play with.\n\nGUIDO\nIt was not altogether I who made of you a brainsick beast. But what you\nare is in part my handiwork. Nevertheless, you shall not harm this child.\n\nTHE DUKE\n\"Shall not\" is a delightfully quaint expression. I only regret that you\nare not likely ever to use it to me again.\n\nGUIDO\nI know this means my ruin.\n\nTHE DUKE\nIndeed, I must venture to remind you, Count Eglamore, that I am still a\nruling prince--\n\nGUIDO\nThat is nothing to me.\n\nTHE DUKE\nAnd that, where you are master of very admirable sentiments, I happen to\nbe master of all Tuscany.\n\nGUIDO\nAt court you are the master. At your court in Florence I have seen many\nmothers raise the veil from their daughters' faces because you were\npassing. But here upon this hill-top I can see only the woman I love and\nthe man who has insulted her.\n\nTHE DUKE\nSo all the world is changed, and Pandarus is transformed into Hector!\nYour words are very sonorous words, dear Eglamore, but by what deeds\ndo you propose to back them?\n\nGUIDO\nBy killing you, your highness.\n\nTHE DUKE\nBut in what manner? By stifling me with virtuous rhetoric? Hah, it is\nrather awkward for you--is it not--that our sumptuary laws forbid you\nmerchants to carry swords?\n\nGUIDO\n(_Draws his dagger._) I think this knife will serve me, highness, to make\nearth a cleaner place.\n\nTHE DUKE\n(_Drawing his long sword._) It would save trouble now to split you like a\nchicken for roasting.... (_He shrugs, and sheathes his sword. He unbuckles\nhis sword-belt, and lays it aside._) No, no, this farce ascends in\ninterest. So let us play it fairly to the end. I risk nothing, since from\nthis moment you are useless to me, my rebellious lackey--\n\nGUIDO\nYou risk your life, for very certainly I mean to kill you.\n\nTHE DUKE\nTwo go to every bargain, my friend. Now, if I kill you, it is always\ndiverting to kill; and if by any chance you should kill me, I shall at\nleast be rid of the intolerable knowledge that to-morrow will be just like\nto-day.\n\n_He draws his dagger. The two men engage warily but with determination,\nthe DUKE presently advancing. GUIDO steps backward, and in the act trips\nover the pedler's pack, and falls prostrate. His dagger flies from his\nhand. GRACIOSA, with a little cry, has covered her face. Nobody strikes\nan attitude, because nobody is conscious of any need to be heroic, but\nthere is a perceptible silence, which is broken by the DUKE'S quiet\nvoice._\n\nTHE DUKE\nWell! am I to be kept waiting forever? You were quicker in obeying my\ncaprices yesterday. Get up, you muddy lout, and let us kill each other\nwith some pretension of adroitness.\n\nGUIDO\n(_Rising, with a sob._) Ah!\n\n_He catches up the fallen dagger, and attacks the DUKE, this time with\nutter disregard of the rules of fence and his own safety. GUIDO drives the\nDUKE back. GUIDO is careless of defence, and desirous only to kill. The\nDUKE is wounded, and falls with a cry at the foot of the shrine. GUIDO\nutters a sort of strangled growl. He raises his dagger, intending to hack\nat and mutilate his antagonist, who is now unconscious. As GUIDO stoops,\nGRACIOSA, from behind him, catches his arm._\n\nGRACIOSA\nHe gave you your life.\n\n_GUIDO turns. He drops the weapon. He speaks with great gentleness, almost\nwith weariness._\n\nGUIDO\nMadonna, the Duke is not yet dead. That wound is nothing serious.\n\nGRACIOSA\nHe spared your life.\n\nGUIDO\nIt is impossible to let him live.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut I think he only voiced a caprice--\n\nGUIDO\nI think so, too, but I know that all this madman's whims are ruthless.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut you have power--\n\nGUIDO\nPower! I, who have attacked the Duke's person! I, who have done what your\ndead cousin merely planned to do!\n\nGRACIOSA\nGuido--!\n\nGUIDO\nLiving, this brain-sick beast will make of you his plaything--and, a\nlittle later, his broken, soiled and cast-by plaything. It is therefore\nnecessary that I kill Duke Alessandro.\n\n_GRACIOSA moves away from him, and GUIDO rises._\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd afterward--and afterward you must die just as Tebaldeo died!\n\nGUIDO\nThat is the law, madonna. But what he said is true. I am useless to him,\na rebellious lackey to be punished. Whether I have his life or no, I am a\nlost man.\n\nGRACIOSA\nA moment since you were Count Eglamore, whom all our nobles feared--\n\nGUIDO\nNow there is not a beggar in the kingdom who would change lots with me.\nBut at least I shall first kill this kingdom's lord.\n\n_He picks up his dagger._\n\nGRACIOSA\nYou are a friendless and hunted man, in peril of a dreadful death. But\neven so, you are not penniless. These jewels here are of great value--\n\n_GUIDO laughs, and hangs the pearls about her neck._\n\nGUIDO\nDo you keep them, then.\n\nGRACIOSA\nThere is a world outside this kingdom. You have only to make your way\nthrough the forest to be out of Tuscany.\n\nGUIDO\n(_Coolly reflective._) Perhaps I might escape, going north to Bologna, and\nthen to Venice, which is at war with the Duke--\n\nGRACIOSA\nI can tell you the path to Bologna.\n\nGUIDO\nBut first the Duke must die, because his death saves you.\n\nGRACIOSA\nNo, Guido! I would have Eglamore go hence with hands as clean as possible.\n\nGUIDO\nNot even Eglamore would leave you at the mercy of this poet.\n\nGRACIOSA\nHow does that matter! It is no secret that my father intends to market me\nas best suits his interests. And the great Duke of Florence, no less,\nwould have been my purchaser! You heard him, \"I will buy this jewel,\" he\nsaid. He would have paid thrice what any of my sisters' purchasers have\npaid. You know very well that my father would have been delighted.\n\nGUIDO\n(_Since the truth of what she has just said is known to him by more\nstartling proofs than she dreams of, he speaks rather bitterly, as he\nsheathes the dagger._) And I must need upset the bargain between these\njewel merchants!\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Lightly._) \"No, I will not have it!\" Count Eglamore must cry. (_Her\nhand upon his arm._) My dear unthrifty pedler! it cost you a great deal to\nspeak those words.\n\nGUIDO\nI had no choice. I love you. (_A pause. As GRACIOSA does not speak, GUIDO\ncontinues, very quiet at first._) It is a theme on which I shall not\nembroider. So long as I thought to use you as an instrument I could woo\nfluently enough. Today I saw that you were frightened and helpless--oh,\nquite helpless. And something in me changed. I knew for the first time\nthat I loved you. And I knew I was not clean as you are clean. I knew\nthat I had more in common with this beast here than I had with you.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Who with feminine practicality, while the man talks, has reached her\ndecision._) We daughters of the Valori are so much merchandise.... Heigho,\nsince I cannot help it, since bought and sold I must be, one day or\nanother, at least I will go at a noble price. Yet I do not think I am\nquite worth the wealth and power which you have given up because of me. So\nit will be necessary to make up the difference, dear, by loving you very\nmuch.\n\n_GUIDO takes her hands, only half-believing that he understands her\nmeaning. He puts an arm about her shoulder, holding her at a distance, the\nbetter to see her face._\n\nGUIDO\nYou, who had only scorn to give me when I was a kingdom's master! Would\nyou go with me now that I am homeless and friendless?\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_Archly._) But to me you do not seem quite friendless.\n\nGUIDO\nGraciosa--!\n\nGRACIOSA\nAnd I doubt if you could ever find your way through the forest alone.\n(_But as she stands there with one hand raised to each of his shoulders\nher vindication is self-revealed, and she indicates her bracelet rather\nindignantly._) Besides, what else is a poor maid to do, when she is\nburdened with a talisman that compels her to marry the man whom she--so\nvery much--prefers?\n\nGUIDO\n(_Drawing her to him._) Ah, you shall not regret that foolish preference.\n\nGRACIOSA\nBut come! There is a path--(_They are gathering up the pack and its\ncontents, as GUIDO pauses by the DUKE._) Is he--?\n\nGUIDO\nHe will not enter Hell to-day. (_The DUKE stirs._) Already he revives, you\nsee. So let us begone before his attendants come.\n\n_GUIDO lifts her to the top of the wall. He lifts up the pack._\n\nGRACIOSA\nMy lute!\n\nGUIDO\n(_Giving it to her._) So we may pass for minstrels on the road to Venice.\n\nGRACIOSA\nYes, singing the Duke's songs to pay our way. (_GUIDO climbs over the\nwall, and stands on the far side, examining the landscape beneath._)\nHorsemen!\n\nGUIDO\nThe Duke's attendants fetching him new women--two more of those numerous\ndamsels that his song demands. They will revive this ruinous songmaker to\nrule over Tuscany more foolishly than Eglamore governed when Eglamore was\na great lord. (_He speaks pensively, still looking down._) It is a very\nrich and lovely country, this kingdom which a half-hour since lay in the\nhollow of my hand. Now I am empty-handed.\n\nGRACIOSA\n(_With mocking reproach._) Empty-handed!\n\n_She extends to him both her hands. GUIDO takes them, and laughs joyously,\nsaying,_ \"Come!\" _as he lifts her down._\n\n_There is a moment's silence, then is heard the song and lute-playing with\nwhich the play began, growing ever more distant:..._\n\n     \"Knights as my serfs be given;\n    And as I will, let music go and come.\"\n\n_... The DUKE moves. The DUKE half raises himself at the foot of the\ncrucifix._\n\nTHE DUKE\nEglamore! I am hurt. Help me, Eglamore!\n\n\n(THE CURTAIN FALLS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Jewel Merchants, by James Branch Cabell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE JEWEL MERCHANTS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9829-8.txt or 9829-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/9/8/2/9829/\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Clare Boothby and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
