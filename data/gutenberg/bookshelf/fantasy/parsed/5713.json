A place you\nwould scarcely have heard of. A village up top of the hills.\n\n\"When the war came there was no more than thirty men there between\nsixteen and forty-five. They all went.\n\n\"They all kept together; same battalion, same platoon. They was like\nthat in Daleswood. Used to call the hop pickers foreigners, the ones\nthat come from London. They used to go past Daleswood, some of them,\nevery year, on their way down to the hop fields. Foreigners they used\nto call them. Kept very much to themselves, did the Daleswood people.\nBig woods all round them.\n\n\"Very lucky they was, the Daleswood men. They'd lost no more than\nfive killed and a good sprinkling of wounded. But all the wounded was\nback again with the platoon. This was up to March when the big\noffensive started.\n\n\"It came very sudden. No bombardment to speak of. Just a burst of Tok\nEmmas going off all together and lifting the front trench clean out of\nit; then a barrage behind, and the Boche pouring over in thousands.\n'Our luck is holding good,' the Daleswood men said, for their trench\nwasn't getting it at all. But the platoon on their right got it. And\nit sounded bad too a long way beyond that. No one could be quite sure.\nBut the platoon on their right was getting it: that was sure enough.\n\n\"And then the Boche got through them altogether. A message came to\nsay so. 'How are things on the right?' they said to the runner. 'Bad,'\nsaid the runner, and he went back, though Lord knows what he went back\nto. The Boche was through right enough. 'We'll have to make a\ndefensive flank,' said the platoon commander. He was a Daleswood man\ntoo. Came from the big farm. He slipped down a communication trench\nwith a few men, mostly bombers. And they reckoned they wouldn't see\nany of them any more, for the Boche was on the right, thick as\nstarlings.\n\n\"The bullets were snapping over thick to keep them down while the\nBoche went on, on the right: machine guns, of course. The barrage was\nscreaming well over and dropping far back, and their wire was still\nall right just in front of them, when they put up a head to look.\nThere was the left platoon of the battalion. One doesn't bother,\nsomehow, so much about another battalion as one's own. One's own gets\nsort of homely. And there they were wondering how their own officer\nwas getting on, and the few fellows with them, on his defensive flank.\nThe bombs were going off thick. All the Daleswood men were firing half\nright. It sounded from the noise as if it couldn't last long, as if it\nwould soon be decisive, and the battle be won, or lost, just there on\nthe right, and perhaps the war ended. They didn't notice the left.\nNothing to speak of.\n\n\"Then a runner came from the left. 'Hullo!' they said, 'How are\nthings over there?'\n\n\"'The Boche is through,' he said. 'Where's the officer?' 'Through!'\nthey said. It didn't seem possible. However did he do that? they\nthought. And the runner went on to the right to look for the officer.\n\n\"And then the barrage shifted further back. The shells still screamed\nover them, but the bursts were further away. That is always a relief.\nProbably they felt it. But it was bad for all that. Very bad. It meant\nthe Boche was well past them. They realized it after a while.\n\n\"They and their bit of wire were somehow just between two waves of\nattack. Like a bit of stone on the beach with the sea coming in. A\nplatoon was nothing to the Boche; nothing much perhaps just then to\nanybody. But it was the whole of Daleswood for one long generation.\n\n\"The youngest full-grown man they had left behind was fifty, and some\none had heard that he had died since the war. There was no one else in\nDaleswood but women and children, and boys up to seventeen.\n\n\"The bombing had stopped on their right; everything was quieter, and\nthe barrage further away. When they began to realize what that meant\nthey began to talk of Daleswood. And then they thought that when all\nof them were gone there would be nobody who would remember Daleswood\njust as it used to be. For places alter a little, woods grow, and\nchanges come, trees get cut down, old people die; new houses are built\nnow and then in place of a yew tree, or any old thing, that used to be\nthere before; and one way or another the old things go; and all the\ntime you have people thinking that the old times were best, and the\nold ways when they were young. And the Daleswood men were beginning to\nsay, 'Who would there be to remember it just as it was?'\n\n\"There was no gas, the wind being wrong for it, so they were able to\ntalk, that is if they shouted, for the bullets alone made as much\nnoise as breaking up an old shed, crisper like, more like new timber\nbreaking; and the shells of course was howling all the time, that is\nthe barrage that was bursting far back. The trench still stank of\nthem.\n\n\"They said that one of them must go over and put his hands up, or run\naway if he could, whichever he liked, and when the war was over he\nwould go to some writing fellow, one of those what makes a living by\nit, and tell him all about Daleswood, just as it used to be, and he\nwould write it out proper and there it would be for always. They all\nagreed to that. And then they talked a bit, as well as they could\nabove that awful screeching, to try and decide who it should be. The\neldest, they said, would know Daleswood best. But he said, and they\ncame to agree with him, that it would be a sort of waste to save the\nlife of a man what had had his good time, and they ought to send the\nyoungest, and they would tell him all they knew of Daleswood before\nhis time, and everything would be written down just the same and the\nold time remembered.\n\n\"They had the idea somehow that the women thought more of their own\nman and their children and the washing and what-not; and that the deep\nwoods and the great hills beyond, and the plowing and the harvest and\nsnaring rabbits in winter and the sports in the village in summer, and\nthe hundred things that pass the time of one generation in an old, old\nplace like Daleswood, meant less to them than the men. Anyhow they did\nnot quite seem to trust them with the past.\n\n\"The youngest of them was only just eighteen. That was Dick. They\ntold him to get out and put his hands up and be quick getting across,\nas soon as they had told him one or two things about the old time in\nDaleswood that a youngster like him wouldn't know.\n\n\"Well, Dick said he wasn't going, and was making trouble about it, so\nthey told Fred to go. Back, they told him, was best, and come up\nbehind the Boche with his hands up; they would be less likely to shoot\nwhen it was back towards their own supports.\n\n\"Fred wouldn't go, and so on with the rest. Well, they didn't waste\ntime quarrelling, time being scarce, and they said what was to be\ndone? There was chalk where they were, low down in the trench, a\nlittle brown clay on the top of it. There was a great block of it\nloose near a shelter. They said they would carve with their knives on\nthe big bowlder of chalk all that they knew about Daleswood. They\nwould write where it was and just what it was like, and they would\nwrite something of all those little things that pass with a\ngeneration. They reckoned on having the time for it. It would take a\ndirect hit with something large, what they call big stuff, to do any\nharm to that bowlder. They had no confidence in paper, it got so\nmessed up when you were hit; besides, the Boche had been using\nthermite. Burns, that does.\n\n\"They'd one or two men that were handy at carving chalk; used to do\nthe regimental crest and pictures of Hindenburg, and all that. They\ndecided they'd do it in reliefs.\n\n\"They started smoothing the chalk. They had nothing more to do but\njust to think what to write. It was a great big bowlder with plenty of\nroom on it. The Boche seemed not to know that they hadn't killed the\nDaleswood men, just as the sea mightn't know that one stone stayed dry\nat the coming in of the tide. A gap between two divisions probably.\n\n\"Harry wanted to tell of the woods more than anything. He was afraid\nthey might cut them down because of the war, and no one would know of\nthe larks they had had there as boys. Wonderful old woods they were,\nwith a lot of Spanish chestnut growing low, and tall old oaks over it.\nHarry wanted them to write down what the foxgloves were like in the\nwood at the end of summer, standing there in the evening, 'Great\nsolemn rows,' he said, 'all odd in the dusk. All odd in the evening,\ngoing there after work; and makes you think of fairies.' There was\nlots of things about those woods, he said, that ought to be put down\nif people were to remember Daleswood as it used to be when they knew\nit. What were the good old days without those woods? he said.\n\n\"But another wanted to tell of the time when they cut the hay with\nscythes, working all those long days at the end of June; there would\nbe no more of that, he said, with machines come in and all.\n\n\"There was room to tell of all that and the woods too, said the\nothers, so long as they put it short like.\n\n\"And another wanted to tell of the valleys beyond the wood, far\nafield where the men went working; the women would remember the hay.\nThe great valleys he'd tell of. It was they that made Daleswood. The\nvalleys beyond the wood and the twilight on them in summer. Slopes\ncovered with mint and thyme, all solemn at evening. A hare on them\nperhaps, sitting as though they were his, then lolloping slowly away.\nIt didn't seem from the way he told of those old valleys that he\nthought they could ever be to other folk what they were to the\nDaleswood men in the days he remembered. He spoke of them as though\nthere were something in them, besides the mint and the thyme and the\ntwilight and hares, that would not stay after these men were gone,\nthough he did not say what it was. Scarcely hinted it even.\n\n\"And still the Boche did nothing to the Daleswood men. The bullets\nhad ceased altogether. That made it much quieter. The shells still\nsnarled over, bursting far, far away.\n\n\"And Bob said tell of Daleswood itself, the old village, with queer\nchimneys, of red brick, in the wood. There weren't houses like that\nnowadays. They'd be building new ones and spoiling it, likely, after\nthe war. And that was all he had to say.\n\n\"And nobody was for not putting down anything any one said. It was\nall to go in on the chalk, as much as would go in the time. For they\nall sort of understood that the Daleswood of what they called the good\nold time was just the memories that those few men had of the days they\nhad spent there together. And that was the Daleswood they loved, and\nwanted folks to remember. They were all agreed as to that. And then\nthey said how was they to write it down. And when it came to writing\nthere was so much to be said, not spread over a lot of paper I don't\nmean, but going down so deep like, that it seemed to them how their\nown talk wouldn't be good enough to say it. And they knew no other,\nand didn't know what to do. I reckon they'd been reading magazines and\nthought that writing had to be like that muck. Anyway, they didn't\nknow what to do. I reckon their talk would be good enough for\nDaleswood when they loved Daleswood like that. But they didn't, and\nthey were puzzled.\n\n\"The Boche was miles away behind them now, and his barrage with him.\nStill in front he did nothing.\n\n\"They talked it all over and over, did the Daleswood men. They tried\neverything. But somehow or other they couldn't get near what they\nwanted to say about old summer evenings. Time wore on. The bowlder was\nsmooth and ready, and that whole generation of Daleswood men could\nfind no words to say what was in their hearts about Daleswood. There\nwasn't time to waste. And the only thing they thought of in the end\nwas 'Please, God, remember Daleswood just like it used to be.' And\nBill and Harry carved that on the chalk between them.\n\n\"What happened to the Daleswood men? Why, nothing. There come one of\nthem counter-attacks, a regular bastard for Jerry. The French made it\nand did the Boche in proper. I got the story from a man with a hell of\na great big hammer, long afterwards when that trench was well behind\nour line. He was smashing up a huge great chunk of chalk because he\nsaid they all felt it was so damn silly.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Road\n\n\nThe battery Sergeant-Major was practically asleep. He was all worn out\nby the continuous roar of bombardments that had been shaking the\ndugouts and dazing his brains for weeks. He was pretty well fed up.\n\nThe officer commanding the battery, a young man in a very neat uniform\nand of particularly high birth, came up and spat in his face. The\nSergeant-Major sprang to attention, received an order, and took a\nstick at once and beat up the tired men. For a message had come to the\nbattery that some English (God punish them!) were making a road at X.\n\nThe gun was fired. It was one of those unlucky shots that come on days\nwhen our luck is out. The shell, a 5.9, lit in the midst of the British\nworking party. It did the Germans little good. It did not stop the\ndeluge of shells that was breaking up their guns and was driving\nmisery down like a wedge into their spirits. It did not improve the\ntemper of the officer commanding the battery, so that the men suffered\nas acutely as ever under the Sergeant-Major. But it stopped the road\nfor that day.\n\nI seemed to see that road going on in a dream.\n\nAnother working party came along next day, with clay pipes and got to\nwork; and next day and the day after. Shells came, but went short or\nover; the shell holes were neatly patched up; the road went on. Here\nand there a tree had to be cut, but not often, not many of them were\nleft; it was mostly digging and grubbing up roots, and pushing\nwheelbarrows along planks and duck-boards, and filling up with stones.\nSometimes the engineers would come: that was when streams were\ncrossed. The engineers made their bridges, and the infantry working\nparty went on with the digging and laying down stones. It was\nmonotonous work. Contours altered, soil altered, even the rock beneath\nit, but the desolation never; they always worked in desolation and\nthunder. And so the road went on.\n\nThey came to a wide river. They went through a great forest. They\npassed the ruins of what must have been quite fine towns, big\nprosperous towns with universities in them. I saw the infantry working\nparty with their stumpy clay pipes, in my dream, a long way on from\nwhere that shell had lit, which stopped the road for a day. And behind\nthem curious changes came over the road at X. You saw the infantry\ngoing up to the trenches, and going back along it into reserve. They\nmarched at first, but in a few days they were going up in motors, grey\nbusses with shuttered windows. And then the guns came along it, miles\nand miles of guns, following after the thunder which was further off\nover the hills. And then one day the cavalry came by. Then stores in\nwagons, the thunder muttering further and further away. I saw\nfarm-carts going down the road at X. And then one day all manner of\nhorses and traps and laughing people, farmers and women and boys all\ngoing by to X. There was going to be a fair.\n\nAnd far away the road was growing longer and longer amidst, as always,\ndesolation and thunder. And one day far away from X the road grew very\nfine indeed. It was going proudly through a mighty city, sweeping in\nlike a river; you would not think that it ever remembered duck-boards.\nThere were great palaces there, with huge armorial eagles blazoned in\nstone, and all along each side of the road was a row of statues of\nkings. And going down the road towards the palace, past the statues of\nthe kings, a tired procession was riding, full of the flags of the\nAllies. And I looked at the flags in my dream, out of national pride\nto see whether we led, or whether France or America. America went\nbefore us, but I could not see the Union Jack in the van nor the\nTricolour either, nor the Stars and Stripes: Belgium led and then\nSerbia, they that had suffered most.\n\nAnd before the flags, and before the generals, I saw marching along on\nfoot the ghosts of the working party that were killed at X, gazing\nabout them in admiration as they went, at the great city and at the\npalaces. And one man, wondering at the Si\u00e8ges All\u00e9e, turned round to\nthe Lance Corporal in charge of the party: \"That is a fine road that\nwe made, Frank,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nAn Imperial Monument\n\n\nIt is an early summer's morning: the dew is all over France: the train\nis going eastwards. They are quite slow, those troop trains, and there\nare few embankments or cuttings in those flat plains, so that you seem\nto be meandering along through the very life of the people. The roads\ncome right down to the railways, and the sun is shining brightly over\nthe farms and the people going to work along the roads, so that you\ncan see their faces clearly as the slow train passes them by.\n\nThey are all women and boys that work on the farms; sometimes perhaps\nyou see a very old man, but nearly always women and boys; they are out\nworking early. They straighten up from their work as we go by and lift\ntheir hands to bless us.\n\nWe pass by long rows of the tall French poplars, their branches cut\naway all up the trunk, leaving only an odd round tuft at the top of\nthe tree; but little branches are growing all up the trunk now, and\nthe poplars are looking unkempt. It would be the young men who would\ncut the branches of the poplars. They would cut them for some useful\nthrifty purpose that I do not know; and then they would cut them\nbecause they were always cut that way, as long ago as the times of the\nold men's tales about France; but chiefly, I expect, because youth\nlikes to climb difficult trees; that is why they are clipped so very\nhigh. And the trunks are all unkempt now.\n\nWe go on by many farms with their shapely red-roofed houses; they\nstand there, having the air of the homes of an ancient people; they\nwould not be out of keeping with any romance that might come, or any\nromance that has come in the long story of France, and the girls of\nthose red-roofed houses work all alone in the fields.\n\nWe pass by many willows and come to a great marsh. In a punt on some\nopen water an old man is angling. We come to fields again, and then to\na deep wood. France smiles about us in the open sunlight.\n\nBut towards evening we pass over the border of this pleasant country\ninto a tragical land of destruction and gloom. It is not only that\nmurder has walked here to and fro for years, until all the fields are\nominous with it, but the very fields themselves have been mutilated\nuntil they are unlike fields, the woods have been shattered right down\nto the anemones, and the houses have been piled in heaps of rubbish,\nand the heaps of rubbish have been scattered by shells. We see no more\ntrees, no more houses, no more women, no cattle even now. We have come\nto the abomination of desolation. And over it broods, and will\nprobably brood for ever, accursed by men and accursed by the very\nfields, the hyena-like memory of the Kaiser, who has whitened so many\nbones.\n\nIt may be some satisfaction to his selfishness to know that the\nmonument to it cannot pass away, to know that the shell holes go too\ndeep to be washed away by the healing rains of years, to know that the\nwasted German generations will not in centuries gather up what has\nbeen spilt on the Somme, or France recover in the sunshine of many\nsummers from all the misery that his devilish folly has caused. It is\nlikely to be to such as him a source of satisfaction, for the truly\nvain care only to be talked of in many mouths; they hysterically love\nto be thought of, and the notice of mankind is to them a mirror which\nreflects their futile postures. The admiration of fools they love, and\nthe praise of a slavelike people, but they would sooner be hated by\nmankind than be ignored and forgotten as is their due. And the truly\nselfish care only for their imperial selves.\n\nLet us leave him to pass in thought from ruin to ruin, from wasted\nfield to field, from crater to crater; let us leave his fancy haunting\ncemeteries in the stricken lands of the world, to find what glee he\ncan in this huge manifestation of his imperial will.\n\nWe neither know to what punishment he moves nor can even guess what\nfitting one is decreed. But the time is surely appointed and the\nplace. Poor trifler with Destiny, who ever had so much to dread?\n\n\n\n\nA Walk to the Trenches\n\n\nTo stand at the beginning of a road is always wonderful; for on all\nroads before they end experience lies, sometimes adventure. And a\ntrench, even as a road, has its beginnings somewhere. In the heart of\na very strange country you find them suddenly. A trench may begin in\nthe ruins of a house, may run up out of a ditch; may be cut into a\nrise of ground sheltered under a hill, and is built in many ways by\nmany men. As to who is the best builder of trenches there can be\nlittle doubt, and any British soldier would probably admit that for\npainstaking work and excellence of construction there are few to rival\nVon Hindenburg. His Hindenburg line is a model of neatness and\ncomfort, and it would be only a very ungrateful British soldier who\nwould deny it.\n\nYou come to the trenches out of strangely wasted lands, you come\nperhaps to a wood in an agony of contortions, black, branchless,\nsepulchral trees, and then no more trees at all. The country after\nthat is still called Picardy or Belgium, still has its old name on the\nmap as though it smiled there yet, sheltering cities and hamlet and\nradiant with orchards and gardens, but the country named Belgium--or\nwhatever it be--is all gone away, and there stretches for miles\ninstead one of the world's great deserts, a thing to take its place no\nlonger with smiling lands, but with Sahara, Gobi, Kalahari, and the\nKaroo; not to be thought of as Picardy, but more suitably to be named\nthe Desert of Wilhelm. Through these sad lands one goes to come to the\ntrenches. Overhead floats until it is chased away an a\u00ebroplane with\nlittle black crosses, that you can scarcely see at his respectful\nheight, peering to see what more harm may be done in the desolation\nand ruin. Little flashes sparkle near him, white puffs spread out\nround the flashes: and he goes, and our airmen go away after him;\nblack puffs break out round our airmen. Up in the sky you hear a faint\ntap-tapping. They have got their machine guns working.\n\nYou see many things there that are unusual in deserts: a good road, a\nrailway, perhaps a motor bus; you see what was obviously once a\nvillage, and hear English songs, but no one who has not seen it can\nimagine the country in which the trenches lie, unless he bear a desert\nclearly in mind, a desert that has moved from its place on the map by\nsome enchantment of wizardry, and come down on a smiling country.\nWould it not be glorious to be a Kaiser and be able to do things like\nthat?\n\nPast all manner of men, past no trees, no hedges, no fields, but only\none field from skyline to skyline that has been harrowed by war, one\ngoes with companions that this event in our history has drawn from all\nparts of the earth. On that road you may hear all in one walk where is\nthe best place to get lunch in the City; you may hear how they laid a\ndrag for some Irish pack, and what the Master said; you may hear a\nfarmer lamenting over the harm that rhinoceroses do to his coffee\ncrop; you may hear Shakespeare quoted and La vie Parisienne.\n\nIn the village you see a lot of German orders, with their silly notes\nof exclamation after them, written up on notice boards among the\nruins. Ruins and German orders. That turning movement of Von Kluck's\nnear Paris in 1914 was a mistake. Had he not done it we might have had\nruins and German orders everywhere. And yet Von Kluck may comfort\nhimself with the thought that it is not by his mistakes that Destiny\nshapes the world: such a nightmare as a world-wide German domination\ncan have had no place amongst the scheme of things.\n\nBeyond the village the batteries are thick. A great howitzer near the\nroad lifts its huge muzzle slowly, fires and goes down again, and\nlifts again and fires. It is as though Polyphemus had lifted his huge\nshape slowly, leisurely, from the hillside where he was sitting, and\nhurled the mountain top, and sat down again. If he is firing pretty\nregularly you are sure to get the blast of one of them as you go by,\nand it can be a very strong wind indeed. One's horse, if one is\nriding, does not very much like it, but I have seen horses far more\nfrightened by a puddle on the road when coming home from hunting in\nthe evening: one 12-inch howitzer more or less in France calls for no\ngreat attention from man or beast.\n\nAnd so we come in sight of the support trenches where we are to dwell\nfor a week before we go on for another mile over the hills, where the\nblack fountains are rising.\n\n\n\n\nA Walk in Picardy\n\n\nPicture any village you know. In such a village as that the trench\nbegins. That is to say, there are duck-boards along a ditch, and the\nditch runs into a trench. Only the village is no longer there. It was\nlike some village you know, though perhaps a little merrier, because\nit was further south and nearer the sun; but it is all gone now. And\nthe trench runs out of the ruins, and is called Windmill Avenue. There\nmust have been a windmill standing there once.\n\nWhen you come from the ditch to the trench you leave the weeds and\nsoil and trunks of willows and see the bare chalk. At the top of those\ntwo white walls is a foot or so of brown clay. The brown clay grows\ndeeper as you come to the hills, until the chalk has disappeared\naltogether. Our alliance with France is new in the history of man, but\nit is an old, old union in the history of the hills. White chalk with\nbrown clay on top has dipped and gone under the sea; and the hills of\nSussex and Kent are one with the hills of Picardy.\n\nAnd so you may pass through the chalk that lies in that desolate lane\nwith memories of more silent and happier hills; it all depends on what\nthe chalk means to you: you may be unfamiliar with it and in that case\nyou will not notice it; or you may have been born among those\nthyme-scented hills and yet have no errant fancies, so that you will\nnot think of the hills that watched you as a child, but only keep your\nmind on the business in hand; that is probably best.\n\nYou come after a while to other trenches: notice boards guide you, and\nyou keep to Windmill Avenue. You go by Pear Lane, Cherry Lane, and\nPlum Lane. Pear trees, cherry trees and plum trees must have grown\nthere. You are passing through either wild lanes banked with briar,\nover which these various trees peered one by one and showered their\nblossoms down at the end of spring, and girls would have gathered the\nfruit when it ripened, with the help of tall young men; or else you\nare passing through an old walled garden, and the pear and the cherry\nand plum were growing against the wall, looking southwards all through\nthe summer. There is no way whatever of telling which it was; it is\nall one in war; whatever was there is gone; there remain to-day, and\nsurvive, the names of those three trees only. We come next to Apple\nLane. You must not think that an apple tree ever grew there, for we\ntrace here the hand of the wit, who by naming Plum Lane's neighbour\n\"Apple Lane\" merely commemorates the inseparable connection that\nplum has with apple forever in the minds of all who go to modern war.\nFor by mixing apple with plum the manufacturer sees the opportunity of\nconcealing more turnip in the jam, as it were, at the junction of the\ntwo forces, than he might be able to do without this unholy alliance.\n\nWe come presently to the dens of those who trouble us (but only for\nour own good), the dugouts of the trench mortar batteries. It is noisy\nwhen they push up close to the front line and play for half an hour or\nso with their rivals: the enemy sends stuff back, our artillery join\nin; it is as though, while you were playing a game of croquet, giants\nhundreds of feet high, some of them friendly, some unfriendly,\ncarnivorous and hungry, came and played football on your croquet lawn.\n\nWe go on past Battalion Headquarters, and past the dugouts and\nshelters of various people having business with History, past stores\nof bombs and the many other ingredients with which history is made,\npast men coming down who are very hard to pass, for the width of two\nmen and two packs is the width of a communication trench and sometimes\nan inch over; past two men carrying a flying pig slung on a pole\nbetween them; by many turnings; and Windmill Avenue brings you at last\nto Company Headquarters in a dugout that Hindenburg made with his\nGerman thoroughness.\n\nAnd there, after a while, descends the Tok Emma man, the officer\ncommanding a trench mortar battery, and is given perchance a whiskey\nand water, and sits on the best empty box that we have to offer, and\nlights one of our cigarettes.\n\n\"There's going to be a bit of a strafe at 5.30,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happened on the Night of the Twenty-Seventh\n\n\nThe night of the twenty-seventh was Dick Cheeser's first night on\nsentry. The night was far gone when he went on duty; in another hour\nthey would stand to. Dick Cheeser had camouflaged his age when he\nenlisted: he was barely eighteen. A wonderfully short time ago he was\nquite a little boy; now he was in a frontline trench. It hadn't seemed\nthat things were going to alter like that. Dick Cheeser was a plowboy:\nlong brown furrows over haughty, magnificent downs seemed to stretch\naway into the future as far as his mind could see. No narrow outlook\neither, for the life of nations depends upon those brown furrows. But\nthere are the bigger furrows that Mars makes, the long brown trenches\nof war; the life of nations depends on these too; Dick Cheeser had\nnever pictured these. He had heard talk about a big navy and a lot of\nDreadnoughts; silly nonsense he called it. What did one want a big\nnavy for? To keep the Germans out, some people said. But the Germans\nweren't coming. If they wanted to come, why didn't they come? Anybody\ncould see that they never did come. Some of Dick Cheeser's pals had\nvotes.\n\nAnd so he had never pictured any change from plowing the great downs;\nand here was war at last, and here was he. The Corporal showed him\nwhere to stand, told him to keep a good lookout and left him.\n\nAnd there was Dick Cheeser alone in the dark with an army in front of\nhim, eighty yards away: and, if all tales were true, a pretty horrible\narmy.\n\nThe night was awfully still. I use the adverb not as Dick Cheeser\nwould have used it. The stillness awed him. There had not been a shell\nall night. He put his head up over the parapet and waited. Nobody\nfired at him. He felt that the night was waiting for him. He heard\nvoices going along the trench: some one said it was a black night: the\nvoices died away. A mere phrase; the night wasn't black at all, it was\ngrey. Dick Cheeser was staring at it, and the night was staring back\nat him, and seemed to be threatening him; it was grey, grey as an old\ncat that they used to have at home, and as artful. Yes, thought Dick\nCheeser, it was an artful night; that was what was wrong with it. If\nshells had come or the Germans, or anything at all, you would know how\nto take it; but that quiet mist over huge valleys, and stillness!\nAnything might happen. Dick waited and waited, and the night waited\ntoo. He felt they were watching each other, the night and he. He felt\nthat each was crouching. His mind slipped back to the woods on hills\nhe knew. He was watching with eyes and ears and imagination to see\nwhat would happen in No Man's Land under that ominous mist: but his\nmind took a peep for all that at the old woods that he knew. He\npictured himself, he and a band of boys, chasing squirrels again in\nthe summer. They used to chase a squirrel from tree to tree, throwing\nstones, till they tired it: and then they might hit it with a stone:\nusually not. Sometimes the squirrel would hide, and a boy would have\nto climb after it. It was great sport, thought Dick Cheeser. What a\npity he hadn't had a catapult in those days, he thought. Somehow the\nyears when he had not had a catapult seemed all to be wasted years.\nWith a catapult one might get the squirrel almost at once, with luck:\nand what a great thing that would be. All the other boys would come\nround to look at the squirrel, and to look at the catapult, and ask\nhim how he did it. He wouldn't have to say much, there would be the\nsquirrel; no boasting would be necessary with the squirrel lying dead.\nIt might spread to other things, even rabbits; almost anything, in\nfact. He would certainly get a catapult first thing when he got home.\nA little wind blew in the night, too cold for summer. It blew away, as\nit were, the summer of Dick's memories; blew away hills and woods and\nsquirrel. It made for a moment a lane in the mist over No Man's Land.\nDick Cheeser peered down it, but it closed again. \"No,\" Night seemed\nto say, \"you don't guess my secret.\" And the awful hush intensified.\n\"What would they do?\" thought the sentry. \"What were they planning\nin all those miles of silence?\" Even the Verys were few. When one\nwent up, far hills seemed to sit and brood over the valley: their\nblack shapes seemed to know what would happen in the mist and seemed\nsworn not to say. The rocket faded, and the hills went back into\nmystery again, and Dick Cheeser peered level again over the ominous\nvalley.\n\nAll the dangers and sinister shapes and evil destinies, lurking\nbetween the armies in that mist, that the sentry faced that night\ncannot be told until the history of the war is written by a historian\nwho can see the mind of the soldier. Not a shell fell all night, no\nGerman stirred; Dick Cheeser was relieved at \"Stand to\" and his\ncomrades stood to beside him, and soon it was wide, golden, welcome\ndawn.\n\nAnd for all the threats of night the thing that happened was one that\nthe lonely sentry had never foreseen: in the hour of his watching Dick\nCheeser, though scarcely eighteen, became a full-grown man.\n\n\n\n\nStanding To\n\n\nOne cannot say that one time in the trenches is any more tense than\nanother. One cannot take any one particular hour and call it, in\nmodern nonsensical talk, \"typical hour in the trenches.\" The routine\nof the trenches has gone on too long for that. The tensest hour ought\nto be half an hour before dawn, the hour when attacks are expected and\nmen stand to. It is an old convention of war that that is the\ndangerous hour, the hour when defenders are weakest and attack most to\nbe feared. For darkness favours the attackers then as night favours\nthe lion, and then dawn comes and they can hold their gains in the\nlight. Therefore in every trench in every war the garrison is prepared\nin that menacing hour, watching in greater numbers than they do the\nwhole night through. As the first lark lifts from meadows they stand\nthere in the dark. Whenever there is any war in any part of the world\nyou may be sure that at that hour men crowd to their parapets: when\nsleep is deepest in cities they are watching there.\n\nWhen the dawn shimmers a little, and a grey light comes, and widens,\nand all of a sudden figures become distinct, and the hour of the\nattack that is always expected is gone, then perhaps some faint\nfeeling of gladness stirs the newest of the recruits; but chiefly the\nhour passes like all the other hours there, an unnoticed fragment of\nthe long, long routine that is taken with resignation mingled with\njokes.\n\nDawn comes shy with a wind scarce felt, dawn faint and strangely\nperceptible, feeble and faint in the east while men still watch the\ndarkness. When did the darkness go? When did the dawn grow golden? It\nhappened as in a moment, a moment you did not see. Guns flash no\nlonger: the sky is gold and serene; dawn stands there like Victory\nthat will shine, on one of these years when the Kaiser goes the way of\nthe older curses of earth. Dawn, and the men unfix bayonets as they\nstep down from the fire-step and clean their rifles with\npull-throughs. Not all together, but section by section, for it would\nnot do for a whole company to be caught cleaning their rifles at dawn,\nor at any other time.\n\nThey rub off the mud or the rain that has come at night on their\nrifles, they detach the magazine and see that its spring is working,\nthey take out the breechblock and oil it, and put back everything\nclean: and another night is gone; it is one day nearer victory.\n\n\n\n\nThe Splendid Traveller\n\n\nA traveller threw his cloak over his shoulder and came down slopes of\ngold in El Dorado. From incredible heights he came. He came from where\nthe peaks of the pure gold mountain shone a little red with the\nsunset; from crag to crag of gold he stepped down slowly. Sheer out of\nromance he came through the golden evening.\n\nIt was only an incident of every day; the sun had set or was setting,\nthe air turned chill, and a battalion's bugles were playing\n\"Retreat\" when this knightly stranger, a British a\u00ebroplane, dipped,\nand went homeward over the infantry. That beautiful evening call, and\nthe golden cloud bank towering, and that adventurer coming home in the\ncold, happening all together, revealed in a flash the fact (which\nhours of thinking sometimes will not bring) that we live in such a\nperiod of romance as the troubadours would have envied.\n\nHe came, that British airman, over the border, sheer over No Man's\nLand and the heads of the enemy and the mysterious land behind,\nsnatching the secrets that the enemy would conceal. Either he had\ndefeated the German airmen who would have stopped his going, or they\nhad not dared to try. Who knows what he had done? He had been abroad\nand was coming home in the evening, as he did every day.\n\nEven when all its romance has been sifted from an age (as the\ncenturies sift) and set apart from the trivial, and when all has been\nstored by the poets; even then what has any of them more romantic than\nthese adventurers in the evening air, coming home in the twilight with\nthe black shells bursting below?\n\nThe infantry look up with the same vague wonder with which children\nlook at dragon flies; sometimes they do not look at all, for all that\ncomes in France has its part with the wonder of a terrible story as\nwell as with the incidents of the day, incidents that recur year in\nand year out, too often for us to notice them. If a part of the moon\nwere to fall off in the sky and come tumbling to earth, the comment on\nthe lips of the imperturbable British watchers that have seen so much\nwould be, \"Hullo, what is Jerry up to now?\"\n\nAnd so the British a\u00ebroplane glides home in the evening, and the light\nfades from the air, and what is left of the poplars grows dark against\nthe sky, and what is left of the houses grows more mournful in the\ngloaming, and night comes, and with it the sounds of thunder, for the\nairman has given his message to the artillery. It is as though Hermes\nhad gone abroad sailing upon his sandals, and had found some bad land\nbelow those winged feet wherein men did evil and kept not the laws of\ngods or men; and he had brought this message back and the gods were\nangry.\n\nFor the wars we fight to-day are not like other wars, and the wonders\nof them are unlike other wonders. If we do not see in them the saga\nand epic, how shall we tell of them?\n\nEngland\n\n\"And then we used to have sausages,\" said the Sergeant.\n\n\"And mashed?\" said the Private.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Sergeant, \"and beer. And then we used to go home.\nIt was grand in the evenings. We used to go along a lane that was full\nof them wild roses. And then we come to the road where the houses\nwere. They all had their bit of a garden, every house.\"\n\n\"Nice, I calls it, a garden,\" the Private said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Sergeant, \"they all had their garden. It came right\ndown to the road. Wooden palings: none of that there wire.\"\n\n\"I hates wire,\" said the Private.\n\n\"They didn't have none of it,\" the N. C. O. went on. \"The gardens\ncame right down to the road, looking lovely. Old Billy Weeks he had\nthem tall pale-blue flowers in his garden nearly as high as a man.\"\n\n\"Hollyhocks?\" said the Private.\n\n\"No, they wasn't hollyhocks. Lovely they were. We used to stop and\nlook at them, going by every evening. He had a path up the middle of\nhis garden paved with red tiles, Billy Weeks had; and these tall blue\nflowers growing the whole way along it, both sides like. They was a\nwonder. Twenty gardens there must have been, counting them all; but\nnone to touch Billy Weeks with his pale-blue flowers. There was an old\nwindmill away to the left. Then there were the swifts sailing by\noverhead and screeching: just about as high again as the houses. Lord,\nhow them birds did fly. And there was the other young fellows, what\nwere not out walking, standing about by the roadside, just doing\nnothing at all. One of them had a flute: Jim Booker, he was. Those\nwere great days. The bats used to come out, flutter, flutter, flutter;\nand then there'd be a star or two; and the smoke from the chimneys\ngoing all grey; and a little cold wind going up and down like the\nbats; and all the colour going out of things; and the woods looking\nall strange, and a wonderful quiet in them, and a mist coming up from\nthe stream. It's a queer time that. It's always about that time, the\nway I see it: the end of the evening in the long days, and a star or\ntwo, and me and my girl going home.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to talk about things for a bit the way you\nremember them?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Sergeant,\" said the other, \"you go on. You do bring it all\nback so.\"\n\n\"I used to bring her home,\" the Sergeant said, \"to her father's\nhouse. Her father was keeper there, and they had a house in the wood.\nA fine house with queer old tiles on it, and a lot of large friendly\ndogs. I knew them all by name, same as they knew me. I used to walk\nhome then along the side of the wood. The owls would be about; you\ncould hear them yelling. They'd float out of the wood like, sometimes:\nall large and white.\"\n\n\"I knows them,\" said the Private.\n\n\"I saw a fox once so close I could nearly touch him, walking like he\nwas on velvet. He just slipped out of the wood.\"\n\n\"Cunning old brute,\" said the Private.\n\n\"That's the time to be out,\" said the Sergeant. \"Ten o'clock on a\nsummer's night, and the night full of noises, not many of them, but\nwhat there is, strange, and coming from a great way off, through the\nquiet, with nothing to stop them. Dogs barking, owls hooting, an old\ncart; and then just once a sound that you couldn't account for at all,\nnot anyhow. I've heard sounds on nights like that that nobody 'ud\nthink you'd heard, nothing like the flute that young Booker had,\nnothing like anything on earth.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said the Private.\n\n\"I never told any one before, because they wouldn't believe you. But\nit doesn't matter now. There'd be a light in the window to guide me\nwhen I got home. I'd walk up through the flowers of our garden. We had\na lovely garden. Wonderful white and strange the flowers looked of a\nnighttime.\"\n\n\"You bring it all back wonderful,\" said the Private.\n\n\"It's a great thing to have lived,\" said the Sergeant.\n\n\"Yes, Sergeant,\" said the other, \"I wouldn't have missed it, not\nfor anything.\"\n\nFor five days the barrage had rained down behind them: they were\nutterly cut off and had no hope of rescue: their food was done, and\nthey did not know where they were.\n\n\n\n\nShells\n\n\nWhen the a\u00ebroplanes are home and the sunset has flared away, and it is\ncold, and night comes down over France, you notice the guns more than\nyou do by day, or else they are actually more active then, I do not\nknow which it is.\n\nIt is then as though a herd of giants, things of enormous height, came\nout from lairs in the earth and began to play with the hills. It is as\nthough they picked up the tops of the hills in their hands and then\nlet them drop rather slowly. It is exactly like hills falling. You see\nthe flashes all along the sky, and then that lumping thump as though\nthe top of the hill had been let drop, not all in one piece, but\ncrumbled a little as it would drop from your hands if you were three\nhundred feet high and were fooling about in the night, spoiling what\nit had taken so long to make. That is heavy stuff bursting, a little\nway off.\n\nIf you are anywhere near a shell that is bursting, you can hear in it\na curious metallic ring. That applies to the shells of either side,\nprovided that you are near enough, though usually of course it is the\nhostile shell and not your own that you are nearest to, and so one\ndistinguishes them. It is curious, after such a colossal event as this\nexplosion must be in the life of a bar of steel, that anything should\nremain at all of the old bell-like voice of the metal, but it appears\nto, if you listen attentively; it is perhaps its last remonstrance\nbefore leaving its shape and going back to rust in the earth again for\nages.\n\nAnother of the voices of the night is the whine the shell makes in\ncoming; it is not unlike the cry the hyena utters as soon as it's dark\nin Africa: \"How nice traveller would taste,\" the hyena seems to say,\nand \"I want dead White Man.\" It is the rising note of the shell as\nit comes nearer, and its dying away when it has gone over, that make\nit reminiscent of the hyena's method of diction. If it is not going\nover then it has something quite different to say. It begins the same\nas the other, it comes up, talking of the back areas with the same\nlong whine as the other. I have heard old hands say \"That one is\ngoing well over.\" \"Whee-oo,\" says the shell; but just where the\n\"oo\" should be long drawn out and turn into the hyena's final\nsyllable, it says something quite different. \"Zarp,\" it says. That\nis bad. Those are the shells that are looking for you.\n\nAnd then of course there is the whizz-bang coming from close, along\nhis flat trajectory: he has little to say, but comes like a sudden\nwind, and all that he has to do is done and over at once.\n\nAnd then there is the gas shell, who goes over gurgling gluttonously,\nprobably in big herds, putting down a barrage. It is the liquid inside\nthat gurgles before it is turned to gas by the mild explosion; that is\nthe explanation of it; yet that does not prevent one picturing a tribe\nof cannibals who have winded some nice juicy men and are smacking\ntheir chops and dribbling in anticipation.\n\nAnd a wonderful thing to see, even in those wonderful nights, is our\nthermite bursting over the heads of the Germans. The shell breaks into\na shower of golden rain; one cannot judge easily at night how high\nfrom the ground it breaks, but about as high as the tops of trees seen\nat a hundred yards. It spreads out evenly all round and rains down\nslowly; it is a bad shower to be out in, and for a long time after it\nhas fallen, the sodden grass of winter, and the mud and old bones\nbeneath it, burn quietly in a circle. On such a night as this, and in\nsuch showers, the flying pigs will go over, which take two men to\ncarry each of them; they go over and root right down to the German\ndugout, where the German has come in out of the golden rain, and they\nfling it all up in the air.\n\nThese are such nights as Scheherazade with all her versatility never\ndreamed of; or if such nightmares came she certainly never told of\nthem, or her august master, the Sultan, light of the age, would have\nhad her at once beheaded; and his people would have deemed that he did\nwell. It has been reserved for a modern autocrat to dream such a\nnightmare, driven to it perhaps by the tales of a white-whiskered\nScheherazade, the Lord of the Kiel Canal; and being an autocrat he has\nmade the nightmare a reality for the world. But the nightmare is\nstronger than its master, and grows mightier every night; and the\nAll-Highest War Lord learns that there are powers in Hell that are\neasily summoned by the rulers of earth, but that go not easily home.\n\n\n\n\nTwo Degrees of Envy\n\n\nIt was night in the front line and no moon, or the moon was hidden.\nThere was a strafe going on. The Tok Emmas were angry. And the\nartillery on both sides were looking for the Tok Emmas.\n\nTok Emma, I may explain for the blessed dwellers in whatever far happy\nisland there be that has not heard of these things, is the crude\nlanguage of Mars. He has not time to speak of a trunk mortar battery,\nfor he is always in a hurry, and so he calls them T. M.'s. But Bellona\nmight not hear him saying T. M., for all the din that she makes: might\nthink that he said D. N; and so he calls it Tok Emma. Ak, Beer, C,\nDon: this is the alphabet of Mars.\n\nAnd the huge minnies were throwing old limbs out of No Man's Land into\nthe frontline trench, and shells were rasping down through the air\nthat seemed to resist them until it was torn to pieces: they burst and\nshowers of mud came down from heaven. Aimlessly, as it seemed, shells\nwere bursting now and then in the air, with a flash intensely red: the\nsmell of them was drifting down the trenches.\n\nIn the middle of all this Bert Butterworth was hit. \"Only in the\nfoot,\" his pals said. \"Only!\" said Bert. They put him on a\nstretcher and carried him down the trench. They passed Bill\nBritterling, standing in the mud, an old friend of Bert's. Bert's\nface, twisted with pain, looked up to Bill for some sympathy.\n\n\"Lucky devil,\" said Bill.\n\nAcross the way on the other side of No Man's Land there was mud the\nsame as on Bill's side: only the mud over there stank; it didn't seem\nto have been kept clean somehow. And the parapet was sliding away in\nplaces, for working parties had not had much of a chance. They had\nthree Tok Emmas working in that battalion front line, and the British\nbatteries did not quite know where they were, and there were eight of\nthem looking.\n\nFritz Groedenschasser, standing in that unseemly mud, greatly yearned\nfor them to find soon what they were looking for. Eight batteries\nsearching for something they can't find, along a trench in which you\nhave to be, leaves the elephant hunter's most desperate tale a little\ndull and insipid. Not that Fritz Groedenschasser knew anything about\nelephant hunting: he hated all things sporting, and cordially approved\nof the execution of Nurse Cavell. And there was thermite too.\nFlammenwerfer was all very well, a good German weapon: it could burn a\nman alive at twenty yards. But this accursed flaming English thermite\ncould catch you at four miles. It wasn't fair.\n\nThe three German trench mortars were all still firing. When would the\nEnglish batteries find what they were looking for, and this awful\nthing stop? The night was cold and smelly.\n\nFritz shifted his feet in the foul mud, but no warmth came to him that\nway.\n\nA gust of shells was coming along the trench. Still they had not found\nthe minnewerfer! Fritz moved from his place altogether to see if he\ncould find some place where the parapet was not broken. And as he\nmoved along the sewerlike trench he came on a wooden cross that marked\nthe grave of a man he once had known, now buried some days in the\nparapet, old Ritz Handelscheiner.\n\n\"Lucky devil,\" said Fritz.\n\n\n\n\nThe Master of No Man's Land\n\n\nWhen the last dynasty has fallen and the last empire passed away, when\nman himself has gone, there will probably still remain the swede. [The\nrutabaga or Swedish turnip.]\n\nThere grew a swede in No Man's Land by Croisille near the Somme, and\nit had grown there for a long while free from man.\n\nIt grew as you never saw a swede grow before. It grew tall and strong\nand weedy. It lifted its green head and gazed round over No Man's\nLand. Yes, man was gone, and it was the day of the swede.\n\nThe storms were tremendous. Sometimes pieces of iron sang through its\nleaves. But man was gone and it was the day of the swede.\n\nA man used to come there once, a great French farmer, an oppressor of\nswedes. Legends were told of him and his herd of cattle, dark\ntraditions that passed down vegetable generations. It was somehow\nknown in those fields that the man ate swedes.\n\nAnd now his house was gone and he would come no more.\n\nThe storms were terrible, but they were better than man. The swede\nnodded to his companions: the years of freedom had come.\n\nThey had always known among them that these years would come. Man had\nnot been there always, but there had always been swedes. He would go\nsome day, suddenly, as he came. That was the faith of the swedes. And\nwhen the trees went the swede believed that the day was come. When\nhundreds of little weeds arrived that were never allowed before, and\ngrew unchecked, he knew it.\n\nAfter that he grew without any care, in sunlight, moonlight and rain;\ngrew abundantly and luxuriantly in the freedom, and increased in\narrogance till he felt himself greater than man. And indeed in those\nleaden storms that sang often over his foliage all living things\nseemed equal.\n\nThere was little that the Germans left when they retreated from the\nSomme that was higher than this swede. He grew the tallest thing for\nmiles and miles. He dominated the waste. Two cats slunk by him from a\nshattered farm: he towered above them contemptuously.\n\nA partridge ran by him once, far, far below his lofty leaves. The\nnight winds mourning in No Man's Land seemed to sing for him alone.\n\nIt was surely the hour of the swede. For him, it seemed, was No Man's\nLand. And there I met him one night by the light of a German rocket\nand brought him back to our company to cook.\n\n\n\n\nWeeds and Wire\n\n\nThings had been happening. Divisions were moving. There had been,\nthere was going to be, a stunt. A battalion marched over the hill and\nsat down by the road. They had left the trenches three days march to\nthe north and had come to a new country. The officers pulled their\nmaps out; a mild breeze fluttered them; yesterday had been winter and\nto-day was spring; but spring in a desolation so complete and\nfar-reaching that you only knew of it by that little wind. It was\nearly March by the calendar, but the wind was blowing out of the gates\nof April. A platoon commander, feeling that mild wind blowing, forgot\nhis map and began to whistle a tune that suddenly came to him out of\nthe past with the wind. Out of the past it blew and out of the South,\na merry vernal tune of a Southern people. Perhaps only one of those\nthat noticed the tune had ever heard it before. An officer sitting\nnear had heard it sung; it reminded him of a holiday long ago in the\nSouth.\n\n\"Where did you hear that tune?\" he asked the platoon commander.\n\n\"Oh, the hell of a long way from here,\" the platoon commander said.\n\nHe did not remember quite where it was he had heard it, but he\nremembered a sunny day in France and a hill all dark with pine woods,\nand a man coming down at evening out of the woods, and down the slope\nto the village, singing this song. Between the village and the slope\nthere were orchards in blossom. So that he came with his song for\nhundreds of yards through orchards. \"The hell of a way from here,\"\nhe said.\n\nFor a long while then they sat silent.\n\n\"It mightn't have been so very far from here,\" said the platoon\ncommander. \"It was in France, now I come to think of it. But it was a\nlovely part of France, all woods and orchards. Nothing like this,\nthank God.\" And he glanced with a tired look at the unutterable\ndesolation.\n\n\"Where was it?\" said the other.\n\n\"In Picardy,\" he said.\n\n\"Aren't we in Picardy now?\" said his friend.\n\n\"Are we?\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know. The maps don't call it Picardy.\"\n\n\"It was a fine place, anyway,\" the platoon commander said. \"There\nseemed always to be a wonderful light on the hills. A kind of short\ngrass grew on them, and it shone in the sun at evening. There were\nblack woods above them. A man used to come out of them singing at\nevening.\"\n\nHe looked wearily round at the brown desolation of weeds. As far as\nthe two officers could see there was nothing but brown weeds and bits\nof brown barbed wire. He turned from the desolate scene back to his\nreminiscences.\n\n\"He came singing through the orchards into the village,\" he said.\n\"A quaint old place with queer gables, called Ville-en-Bois.\"\n\n\"Do you know where we are?\" said the other.\n\n\"No, said the platoon commander.\"\n\n\"I thought not,\" he said. \"Hadn't you better take a look at the\nmap?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said the platoon commander, and he smoothed out his\nmap and wearily got to the business of finding out where he was.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he said. \"Ville-en-Bois!\"\n\n\n\n\nSpring in England and Flanders\n\n\nVery soon the earliest primroses will be coming out in woods wherever\nthey have been sheltered from the north. They will grow bolder as the\ndays go by, and spread and come all down the slopes of sunny hills.\nThen the anemones will come, like a shy pale people, one of the tribes\nof the elves, who dare not leave the innermost deeps of the wood: in\nthose days all the trees will be in leaf, the bluebells will follow,\nand certain fortunate woods will shelter such myriads of them that the\nbright fresh green of the beech trees will flash between two blues,\nthe blue of the sky and the deeper blue of the bluebells. Later the\nviolets come, and such a time as this is the perfect time to see\nEngland: when the cuckoo is heard and he surprises his hearers; when\nevenings are lengthening out and the bat is abroad again; and all the\nflowers are out and all the birds sing. At such a time not only Nature\nsmiles but our quiet villages and grave old spires wake up from winter\nin the mellow air and wear their centuries lightly. At such a time you\nmight come just at evening on one of those old villages in a valley\nand find it in the mood to tell you the secret of the ages that it hid\nand treasured there before the Normans came. Who knows? For they are\nvery old, very wise, very friendly; they might speak to you one warm\nevening. If you went to them after great suffering they might speak to\nyou; after nights and nights of shelling over in France, they might\nspeak to you and you might hear them clearly.\n\nIt would be a long, long story that they would tell, all about the\nages; and it would vary wonderfully little, much less perhaps than we\nthink; and the repetitions rambling on and on in the evening, as the\nold belfry spoke and the cottages gathered below it, might sound so\nsoothing after the boom of shells that perhaps you would nearly sleep.\nAnd then with one's memory tired out by the war one might never\nremember the long story they told, when the belfry and the\nbrown-roofed houses all murmured at evening, might never remember even\nthat they had spoken all through that warm spring and evening. We may\nhave heard them speak and forgotten that they have spoken. Who knows?\nWe are at war, and see so many strange things: some we must forget,\nsome we must remember; and we cannot choose which.\n\nTo turn from Kent to Flanders is to turn to a time of mourning through\nall seasons alike. Spring there brings out no leaf on myriad oaks, nor\nthe haze of green that floats like a halo above the heads of the birch\ntrees, that stand with their fairylike trunks haunting the deeps of\nthe woods. For miles and miles and miles summer ripens no crops, leads\nout no maidens laughing in the moonlight, and brings no harvest home.\nWhen Autumn looks on orchards in all that region of mourning he looks\nupon barren trees that will never blossom again. Winter drives in no\nsturdy farmers at evening to sit before cheery fires, families meet\nnot at Christmas, and the bells are dumb in belfries; for all by which\na man might remember his home has been utterly swept away: has been\nswept away to make a maniacal dancing ground on which a murderous\npeople dance to their death led by a shallow, clever, callous,\nimperial clown.\n\nThere they dance to their doom till their feet shall find the\nprecipice that was prepared for them on the day that they planned the\nevil things they have done.\n\n\n\n\nThe Nightmare Countries\n\n\nThere are certain lands in the darker dreams of poetry that stand out\nin the memory of generations. There is for instance Poe's \"Dark tarn\nof Auber, the ghoul-haunted region of Weir\"; there are some queer\ntwists in the river Alph as imagined by Coleridge; two lines of\nSwinburne:\n\n     By the tideless dolorous inland sea\n     In a land of sand and ruin and gold\n\nare as haunting as any. There are in literature certain regions of\ngloom, so splendid that whenever you come on them they leave in the\nmind a sort of nightmare country which one's thoughts revisit on\nhearing the lines quoted.\n\nIt is pleasant to picture such countries sometimes when sitting before\nthe fire. It is pleasant because you can banish them by the closing of\na book; a puff of smoke from a pipe will hide them altogether, and\nback come the pleasant, wholesome, familiar things. But in France they\nare there always. In France the nightmare countries stand all night in\nthe starlight; dawn comes and they still are there. The dead are\nburied out of sight and others take their places among men; but the\nlost lands lie unburied gazing up at the winds; and the lost woods\nstand like skeletons all grotesque in the solitude; the very seasons\nhave fled from them. The very seasons have fled; so that if you look\nup to see whether summer has turned to autumn, or if autumn has turned\nto winter yet, nothing remains to show you. It is like the eccentric\ndream of some strange man, very arresting and mysterious, but lacking\ncertain things that should be there before you can recognize it as\nearthly. It is a mad, mad landscape. There are miles and miles and\nmiles of it. It is the biggest thing man has done. It looks as though\nman in his pride, with all his clever inventions, had made for himself\na sorry attempt at creation.\n\nIndeed when we trace it all back to its origin we find at the\nbeginning of this unhappy story a man who was only an emperor and\nwished to be something more. He would have ruled the world but has\nonly meddled with it; and his folly has brought misery to millions,\nand there lies his broken dream on the broken earth. He will never\ntake Paris now. He will never be crowned at Versailles as Emperor of\nEurope; and after that, most secret dream of all, did not the C\u00e6sars\nproclaim themselves divine? Was it not whispered among Macedonian\ncourtiers that Alexander was the child of God? And was the\nHohenzollern less than these?\n\nWhat might not force accomplish? All gone now, that dream and the\nHohenzollern line broken. A maniacal dream and broken farms all mixed\nup together: they make a pretty nightmare and the clouds still gleam\nat night with the flashes of shells, and the sky is still troubled by\nday with uncouth balloons and the black bursts of the German shells\nand the white of our anti-aircraft.\n\nAnd below there lies this wonderful waste land where no girls sing,\nand where no birds come but starlings; where no hedgerows stand, and\nno lanes with wild roses, and where no pathways run through fields of\nwheat, and there are no fields at all and no farms and no farmers; and\ntwo haystacks stand on a hill I know, undestroyed in the desolation,\nand nobody touches them for they know the Germans too well; and the\ntops have been blown off hills down to the chalk. And men say of this\nplace that it is Pozi\u00e8res and of that place that it is Ginchy; nothing\nremains to show that hamlets stood there at all, and a brown, brown\nweed grows over it all for ever; and a mighty spirit has arisen in\nman, and no one bows to the War Lord though many die. And Liberty is\nshe who sang her songs of old, and is fair as she ever was, when men\nsee her in visions, at night in No Man's Land when they have the\nstrength to crawl in: still she walks of a night in Pozi\u00e8res and in\nGinchy.\n\nA fanciful man once called himself the Emperor of the Sahara: the\nGerman Kaiser has stolen into a fair land and holds with weakening\nhands a land of craters and weed, and wire and wild cabbages and old\nGerman bones.\n\n\n\n\nSpring and the Kaiser\n\n\nWhile all the world is waiting for Spring there lie great spaces in\none of the pleasantest lands to which Spring cannot come.\n\nPear trees and cherry and orchards flash over other lands, blossoming\nas abundantly as though their wonder were new, with a beauty as fresh\nand surprising as though nothing like it before had ever adorned\ncountless centuries. Now with the larch and soon with the beech trees\nand hazel, a bright green blazes forth to illumine the year. The\nslopes are covered with violets. Those who have gardens are beginning\nto be proud of them and to point them out to their neighbours. Almond\nand peach in blossom peep over old brick walls. The land dreams of\nsummer all in the youth of the year.\n\nBut better than all this the Germans have found war. The simple\ncontent of a people at peace in pleasant countries counted for nothing\nwith them. Their Kaiser prepared for war, made speeches about war,\nand, when he was ready, made war. And now the hills that should be\ncovered with violets are full of murderous holes, and the holes are\nhalf full of empty meat tins, and the garden walls have gone and the\ngardens with them, and there are no woods left to shelter anemones.\nBoundless masses of brown barbed wire straggle over the landscape. All\nthe orchards there are cut down out of ruthless spite to hurt France\nwhom they cannot conquer. All the little trees that grow near gardens\nare gone, aspen, laburnum and lilac. It is like this for hundreds of\nmiles. Hundreds of ruined towns gaze at it with vacant windows and see\na land from which even Spring is banished. And not a ruined house in\nall the hundred towns but mourns for some one, man, woman or child;\nfor the Germans make war equally on all in the land where Spring comes\nno more.\n\nSome day Spring will come back; some day she will shine all April in\nPicardy again, for Nature is never driven utterly forth, but comes\nback with her seasons to cover up even the vilest things.\n\nShe shall hide the raw earth of the shell holes till the violets come\nagain; she shall bring back even the orchards for Spring to walk in\nonce more; the woods will grow tall again above the southern anemones;\nand the great abandoned guns of the Germans will rust by the rivers of\nFrance. Forgotten like them, the memory of the War Lord will pass with\nhis evil deeds.\n\n\n\n\nTwo Songs\n\n\nOver slopes of English hills looking south in the time of violets,\nevening was falling.\n\nShadows at edges of woods moved, and then merged in the gloaming.\n\nThe bat, like a shadow himself, finding that spring was come, slipped\nfrom the dark of the wood as far as a clump of beech trees and\nfluttered back again on his wonderful quiet wings.\n\nPairing pigeons were home.\n\nVery young rabbits stole out to gaze at the calm still world. They\ncame out as the stars come. At one time they were not there, and then\nyou saw them, but you did not see them come.\n\nTowering clouds to the west built palaces, cities and mountains;\nbastions of rose and precipices of gold; giants went home over them\ndraped in mauve by steep rose-pink ravines into emerald-green empires.\nTurbulences of colour broke out above the departed sun; giants merged\ninto mountains, and cities became seas, and new processions of other\nfantastic things sailed by. But the chalk slopes facing south smiled\non with the same calm light, as though every blade of grass gathered a\nray from the gloaming. All the hills faced the evening with that same\nquiet glow, which faded softly as the air grew colder; and the first\nstar appeared.\n\nVoices came up in the hush, clear from the valley, and ceased. A light\nwas lit, like a spark, in a distant window: more stars appeared and\nthe woods were all dark now, and shapes even on the hill slopes began\nto grow indistinct.\n\nHome by a laneway in the dim, still evening a girl was going, singing\nthe Marseillaise.\n\nIn France where the downs in the north roll away without hedges, as\nthough they were great free giants that man had never confined, as\nthough they were stretching their vast free limbs in the evening, the\nsame light was smiling and glimmering softly away.\n\nA road wound over the downs and away round one of their shoulders. A\nhush lay over them as though the giants slept, or as though they\nguarded in silence their ancient, wonderful history.\n\nThe stillness deepened and the dimness of twilight; and just before\ncolours fade, while shapes can still be distinguished, there came by\nthe road a farmer leading his Norman horse. High over the horse's\nwithers his collar pointed with brass made him fantastic and huge and\nstrange to see in the evening.\n\nThey moved together through that mellow light towards where unseen\namong the clustered downs the old French farmer's house was sheltered\naway.\n\nHe was going home at evening humming \"God Save the King.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Punishment\n\n\nAn exhalation arose, drawn up by the moon, from an old battlefield\nafter the passing of years. It came out of very old craters and\ngathered from trenches, smoked up from No Man's Land, and the ruins of\nfarms; it rose from the rottenness of dead brigades, and lay for half\nthe night over two armies; but at midnight the moon drew it up all\ninto one phantom and it rose and trailed away eastwards.\n\nIt passed over men in grey that were weary of war; it passed over a\nland once prosperous, happy and mighty, in which were a people that\nwere gradually starving; it passed by ancient belfries in which there\nwere no bells now; it passed over fear and misery and weeping, and so\ncame to the palace at Potsdam. It was the dead of the night between\nmidnight and dawn, and the palace was very still that the Emperor\nmight sleep, and sentries guarded it who made no noise and relieved\nothers in silence. Yet it was not so easy to sleep. Picture to\nyourself a murderer who had killed a man. Would you sleep? Picture\nyourself the man that planned this war! Yes, you sleep, but nightmares\ncome.\n\nThe phantom entered the chamber. \"Come,\" it said.\n\nThe Kaiser leaped up at once as obediently as when he came to\nattention on parade, years ago, as a subaltern in the Prussian Guard,\na man whom no woman or child as yet had ever cursed; he leaped up and\nfollowed. They passed the silent sentries; none challenged and none\nsaluted; they were moving swiftly over the town as the felon Gothas\ngo; they came to a cottage in the country. They drifted over a little\ngarden gate, and there in a neat little garden the phantom halted like\na wind that has suddenly ceased. \"Look,\" it said.\n\nShould he look? Yet he must look. The Kaiser looked; and saw a window\nshining and a neat room in the cottage: there was nothing dreadful\nthere; thank the good German God for that; it was all right, after\nall. The Kaiser had had a fright, but it was all right; there was only\na woman with a baby sitting before the fire, and two small children\nand a man. And it was quite a jolly room. And the man was a young\nsoldier; and, why, he was a Prussian Guardsman,--there was his\nhelmet hanging on the wall,--so everything was all right. They were\njolly German children; that was well. How nice and homely the room\nwas. There shone before him, and showed far off in the night, the\nvisible reward of German thrift and industry. It was all so tidy and\nneat, and yet they were quite poor people. The man had done his work\nfor the Fatherland, and yet beyond all that had been able to afford\nall those little knickknacks that make a home so pleasant and that in\ntheir humble little way were luxury. And while the Kaiser looked the\ntwo young children laughed as they played on the floor, not seeing\nthat face at the window.\n\nWhy! Look at the helmet. That was lucky. A bullet hole right through\nthe front of it. That must have gone very close to the man's head. How\never did it get through? It must have glanced upwards as bullets\nsometimes do. The hole was quite low in the helmet. It would be\ndreadful to have bullets coming by close like that. The firelight\nflickered, and the lamp shone on, and the children played on the\nfloor, and the man was smoking out of a china pipe; he was strong and\nable and young, one of the wealth-winners of Germany.\n\n\"Have you seen?\" said the phantom.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Kaiser. It was well, he thought, that a Kaiser\nshould see how his people lived.\n\nAt once the fire went out and the lamp faded away, the room fell\nsombrely into neglect and squalor, and the soldier and the children\nfaded away with the room; all disappeared phantasmally, and nothing\nremained but the helmet in a kind of glow on the wall, and the woman\nsitting all by herself in the darkness.\n\n\"It has all gone,\" said the Kaiser.\n\n\"It has never been,\" said the phantom.\n\nThe Kaiser looked again. Yes, there was nothing there, it was just a\nvision. There were the grey walls all damp and uncared for, and that\nhelmet standing out solid and round, like the only real thing among\nfancies. No, it had never been. It was just a vision.\n\n\"It might have been,\" said the phantom.\n\nMight have been? How might it have been?\n\n\"Come,\" said the phantom.\n\nThey drifted away down a little lane that in summer would have had\nroses, and came to an Uhlan's house; in times of peace a small farmer.\nFarm buildings in good repair showed even in the night, and the black\nshapes of haystacks; again a well-kept garden lay by the house. The\nphantom and the Kaiser stood in the garden; before them a window\nglowed in a lamplit room.\n\n\"Look,\" said the phantom.\n\nThe Kaiser looked again and saw a young couple; the woman played with\na baby, and all was prosperous in the merry room. Again the hard-won\nwealth of Germany shone out for all to see, the cosy comfortable\nfurniture spoke of acres well cared for, spoke of victory in the\nstruggle with the seasons on which wealth of nations depends.\n\n\"It might have been,\" said the phantom. Again the fire died out and\nthe merry scene faded away, leaving a melancholy, ill-kept room, with\npoverty and mourning haunting dusty corners and the woman sitting\nalone.\n\n\"Why do you show me this?\" said the Kaiser. \"Why do you show me\nthese visions?\"\n\n\"Come,\" said the phantom.\n\n\"What is it?\" said the Kaiser. \"Where are you bringing me?\"\n\n\"Come,\" said the phantom.\n\nThey went from window to window, from land to land. You had seen, had\nyou been out that night in Germany, and able to see visions, an\nimperious figure passing from place to place, looking on many scenes.\nHe looked on them, and families withered away, and happy scenes faded,\nand the phantom said to him \"Come.\" He expostulated but obeyed; and\nso they went from window to window of hundreds of farms in Prussia,\ntill they came to the Prussian border and went on into Saxony; and\nalways you would have heard, could you hear spirits speak, \"It might\nhave been,\" \"It might have been,\" repeated from window to window.\n\nThey went down through Saxony, heading for Austria. And for long the\nKaiser kept that callous, imperious look. But at last he, even he, at\nlast he nearly wept. And the phantom turned then and swept him back\nover Saxony, and into Prussia again and over the sentries' heads, back\nto his comfortable bed where it was so hard to sleep.\n\nAnd though they had seen thousands of merry homes, homes that can\nnever be merry now, shrines of perpetual mourning; though they had\nseen thousands of smiling German children, who will never be born now,\nbut were only the visions of hopes blasted by him; for all the leagues\nover which he had been so ruthlessly hurried, dawn was yet barely\nbreaking.\n\nHe had looked on the first few thousand homes of which he had robbed\nall time, and which he must see with his eyes before he may go hence.\nThe first night of the Kaiser's punishment was accomplished.\n\n\n\n\nThe English Spirit\n\n\nBy the end of the South African war Sergeant Cane had got one thing\nvery well fixed in his mind, and that was that war was an overrated\namusement. He said he \"was fed up with it,\" partly because that\nmisused metaphor was then new, partly because every one was saying it:\nhe felt it right down in his bones, and he had a long memory. So when\nwonderful rumours came to the East Anglian village where he lived, on\nAugust 1, 1914, Sergeant Cane said: \"That means war,\" and decided\nthen and there to have nothing to do with it: it was somebody else's\nturn; he felt he had done enough. Then came August 4th, and England\ntrue to her destiny, and then Lord Kitchener's appeal for men.\nSergeant Cane had a family to look after and a nice little house: he\nhad left the army ten years.\n\nIn the next week all the men went who had been in the army before, all\nthat were young enough, and a good sprinkling of the young men too who\nhad never been in the army. Men asked Cane if he was going, and he\nsaid straight out \"No.\"\n\nBy the middle of August Cane was affecting the situation. He was a\nlittle rallying point for men who did not want to go. \"He knows what\nit's like,\" they said.\n\nIn the smoking room of the Big House sat the Squire and his son, Arthur\nSmith; and Sir Munion Boomer-Platt, the Member for the division. The\nSquire's son had been in the last war as a boy, and like Sergeant Cane\nhad left the army since. All the morning he had been cursing an\nimaginary general, seated in the War Office at an imaginary desk with\nSmith's own letter before him, in full view but unopened. Why on earth\ndidn't he answer it, Smith thought. But he was calmer now, and the\nSquire and Sir Munion were talking of Sergeant Cane.\n\n\"Leave him to me,\" said Sir Munion.\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Squire. So Sir Munion Boomer-Platt went off\nand called on Sergeant Cane.\n\nMrs Cane knew what he had come for.\n\n\"Don't let him talk you over, Bill,\" she said.\n\n\"Not he,\" said Sergeant Cane.\n\nSir Munion came on Sergeant Cane in his garden.\n\n\"A fine day,\" said Sir Munion. And from that he went on to the war.\n\"If you enlist,\" he said, \"they will make you a sergeant again at\nonce. You will get a sergeant's pay, and your wife will get the new\nseparation allowance.\"\n\n\"Sooner have Cane,\" said Mrs Cane.\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" said Sir Munion. \"But then there is the\nmedal, probably two or three medals, and the glory of it, and it is\nsuch a splendid life.\"\n\nSir Munion did warm to a thing whenever he began to hear his own\nwords. He painted war as it has always been painted, one of the most\nbeautiful things you could imagine. And then it mustn't be supposed\nthat it was like those wars that there used to be, a long way off.\nThere would be houses where you would be billeted, and good food, and\nshady trees and villages wherever you went. And it was such an\nopportunity of seeing the Continent (\"the Continent as it really\nis,\" Sir Munion called it) as would never come again, and he only\nwished he were younger. Sir Munion really did wish it, as he spoke,\nfor his own words stirred him profoundly; but somehow or other they\ndid not stir Sergeant Cane. No, he had done his share, and he had a\nfamily to look after.\n\nSir Munion could not understand him: he went back to the Big House and\nsaid so. He had told him all the advantages he could think of that\nwere there to be had for the asking, and Sergeant Cane merely\nneglected them.\n\n\"Let me have a try,\" said Arthur Smith. \"He soldiered with me\nbefore.\"\n\nSir Munion shrugged his shoulders. He had all the advantages at his\nfingers' ends, from pay to billeting: there was nothing more to be\nsaid. Nevertheless young Smith went.\n\n\"Hullo, Sergeant Cane,\" said Smith.\n\n\"Hello, sir,\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"Do you remember that night at Reit River?\"\n\n\"Don't I, sir,\" said Cane.\n\n\"One blanket each and no ground sheet?\"\n\n\"I remember, sir,\" said Cane.\n\n\"Didn't it rain,\" said Smith.\n\n\"It rained that night, proper.\"\n\n\"Drowned a few of the lice, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Not many,\" said Cane.\n\n\"No, not many,\" Smith reflected. \"The Boers had the range all right\nthat time.\"\n\n\"Gave it us proper,\" said Cane.\n\n\"We were hungry that night,\" said Smith. \"I could have eaten\nbiltong.\"\n\n\"I did eat some of it,\" said Cane. \"Not bad stuff, what there was\nof it, only not enough.\"\n\n\"I don't think,\" said Smith, \"that I've ever slept on the bare\nearth since.\"\n\n\"No, sir?\" said Cane. \"It's hard. You get used to it. But it will\nalways be hard.\"\n\n\"Yes, it will always be hard,\" said Smith. \"Do you remember the\ntime we were thirsty?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Cane, \"I remember that. One doesn't forget\nthat.\"\n\n\"No. I still dream of it sometimes,\" said Smith. \"It makes a nasty\ndream. I wake with my mouth all dry too, when I dream that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cane, \"one doesn't forget being thirsty.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Smith, \"I suppose we're for it all over again?\"\n\n\"I suppose so, sir,\" said Cane.\n\nAn Investigation Into the Causes and Origin of the War\n\nThe German imperial barber has been called up. He must have been\ncalled up quite early in the war. I have seen photographs in papers\nthat leave no doubt of that. Who he is I do not know: I once read his\nname in an article but have forgotten it; few even know if he still\nlives. And yet what harm he has done! What vast evils he has\nunwittingly originated! Many years ago he invented a frivolity, a jeu\nd'esprit easily forgivable to an artist in the heyday of his youth, to\nwhom his art was new and even perhaps wonderful. A craft, of course,\nrather than an art, and a humble craft at that; but then, the man was\nyoung, and what will not seem wonderful to youth?\n\nHe must have taken the craft very seriously, but as youth takes things\nseriously, fantastically and with laughter. He must have determined to\noutshine rivals: he must have gone away and thought, burning candles\nlate perhaps, when all the palace was still. But how can youth think\nseriously? And there had come to him this absurd, this fantastical\nconceit. What else would have come? The more seriously he took the\ntonsorial art, the more he studied its tricks and phrases and heard\nold barbers lecture, the more sure were the imps of youth to prompt\nhim to laughter and urge him to something outrageous and ridiculous.\nThe background of the dull pomp of Potsdam must have made all this\nmore certain. It was bound to come.\n\nAnd so one day, or, as I have suggested, suddenly late one night,\nthere came to the young artist bending over tonsorial books that\nquaint, mad, odd, preposterous inspiration. Ah, what pleasure there is\nin the madness of youth; it is not like the madness of age, clinging\nto outworn formul\u00e6; it is the madness of breaking away, of galloping\namong precipices, of dallying with the impossible, of courting the\nabsurd. And this inspiration, it was in none of the books; the\nlecturer barbers had not lectured on it, could not dream of it and did\nnot dare to; there was no tradition for it, no precedent; it was mad;\nand to introduce it into the pomp of Potsdam, that was the daring of\nmadness. And this preposterous inspiration of the absurd young\nbarber-madman was nothing less than a moustache that without any curve\nat all, or any suggestion of sanity, should go suddenly up at the ends\nvery nearly as high as the eyes!\n\nHe must have told his young fellow craftsmen first, for youth goes\nfirst to youth with its hallucinations. And they, what could they have\nsaid? You cannot say of madness that it is mad, you cannot call\nabsurdity absurd. To have criticized would have revealed jealousy; and\nas for praise you could not praise a thing like that. They probably\nshrugged, made gestures; and perhaps one friend warned him. But you\ncannot warn a man against a madness; if the madness is in possession\nit will not be warned away: why should it? And then perhaps he went to\nthe old barbers of the Court. You can picture their anger. Age does\nnot learn from youth in any case. But there was the insult to their\nancient craft, bad enough if only imagined, but here openly spoken of.\nAnd what would come of it? They must have feared, on the one hand,\ndishonour to their craft if this young barber were treated as his\nlevity deserved; and, on the other hand, could they have feared his\nsuccess? I think they could not have guessed it.\n\nAnd then the young idiot with his preposterous inspiration must have\nlooked about to see where he could practise his new absurdity. It\nshould have been enough to have talked about it among his fellow\nbarbers; they would have gone with new zest to their work next day for\nthis delirious interlude, and no harm would have been done. \"Fritz,\"\n(or Hans) they would have said, \"was a bit on last night, a bit full\nup,\" or whatever phrase they use to touch on drunkenness; and the\nthing would have been forgotten. We all have our fancies. But this\nyoung fool wanted to get his fancy mixed up with practice: that's\nwhere he was mad. And in Potsdam, of all places.\n\nHe probably tried his friends first, young barbers at the Court and\nothers of his own standing. None of them were fools enough to be seen\ngoing about like that. They had jobs to lose. A Court barber is one\nthing, a man who cuts ordinary hair is quite another. Why should they\nbecome outcasts because their friend chose to be mad?\n\nHe probably tried his inferiors then, but they would have been timid\nfolk; they must have seen the thing was absurd, and of course daren't\nrisk it. Again, why should they?\n\nDid he try to get some noble then to patronize his invention? Probably\nthe first refusals he had soon inflamed his madness more, and he threw\ncaution insanely to the winds, and went straight to the Emperor.\n\nIt was probably about the time that the Emperor dismissed Bismarck;\ncertainly the drawings of that time show him still with a sane\nmoustache.\n\nThe young barber probably chanced on him in this period, finding him\nbereft of an adviser, and ready to be swayed by whatever whim should\ncome. Perhaps he was attracted by the barber's hardihood, perhaps the\nabsurdity of his inspiration had some fascination for him, perhaps he\nmerely saw that the thing was new and, feeling jaded, let the barber\nhave his way. And so the frivolity became a fact, the absurdity became\nvisible, and honour and riches came the way of the barber.\n\nA small thing, you might say, however fantastical. And yet I believe\nthe absurdity of that barber to be among the great evils that have\nbrought death nearer to man; whimsical and farcical as it was, yet a\nthing deadlier than Helen's beauty or Tamerlane's love of skulls. For\njust as character is outwardly shown so outward things react upon the\ncharacter; and who, with that daring barber's ludicrous fancy visible\nalways on his face, could quite go the sober way of beneficent\nmonarchs? The fantasy must be mitigated here, set off there; had you\nsuch a figure to dress, say for amateur theatricals, you would realize\nthe difficulty. The heavy silver eagle to balance it; the glittering\ncuirass lower down, preventing the eye from dwelling too long on the\nbarber's absurdity. And then the pose to go with the cuirass and to\ncarry off the wild conceit of that mad, mad barber. He has much to\nanswer for, that eccentric man whose name so few remember. For pose\nled to actions; and just when Europe most needed a man of wise\ncounsels, restraining the passions of great empires, just then she had\nruling over Germany and, unhappily, dominating Austria, a man who\nevery year grew more akin to the folly of that silly barber's youthful\ninspiration.\n\nLet us forgive the barber. For long I have known from pictures that I\nhave seen of the Kaiser that he has gone to the trenches. Probably he\nis dead. Let us forgive the barber. But let us bear in mind that the\nfutile fancies of youth may be deadly things, and that one of them\nfalling on a fickle mind may so stir its shallows as to urge it to\ndisturb and set in motion the avalanches of illimitable grief.\n\nLost\n\nDescribing a visit, say the papers of March 28th, which the Kaiser\npaid incognito to Cologne Cathedral on March 18th before the great\nbattle, the Cologne correspondent of the Tyd says:\n\nThere were only a few persons in the building. Under high arches\nand in spacious solitude the Kaiser sat, as if in deep thought,\nbefore the priests' choir. Behind him his military staff stood\nrespectfully at a distance. Still musing as he rose, the monarch\nresting both hands on his walking-stick remains standing immovable\nfor some minutes... I shall never forget this picture of the musing\nmonarch praying in Cologne Cathedral on the eve of the great\nbattle.\n\nProbably he won't forget it. The German casualty lists will help to\nremind him. But what is more to the point is that this expert\npropagandist has presumably received orders that we are not to forget\nit, and that the sinister originator of the then impending holocaust\nshould be toned down a little in the eyes at least of the Tyd to\nsomething a little more amiable.\n\nAnd no doubt the little piece of propaganda gave every satisfaction to\nthose who ordered it, or they would not have passed it out to the Tyd,\nand the touching little scene would never have reached our eyes. At\nthe same time the little tale would have been better suited to the\npsychology of other countries if he had made the War Lord kneel when\nhe prayed in Cologne Cathedral, and if he had represented the Military\nStaff as standing out of respect to One who, outside Germany, is held\nin greater respect than the All Highest.\n\nAnd had the War Lord really knelt is it not possible that he might\nhave found pity, humility, or even contrition? Things easily\noverlooked in so large a cathedral when sitting erect, as a War Lord,\nbefore the priests' choir, but to be noticed perhaps with one's eyes\nturned to the ground.\n\nPerhaps he nearly found one of those things. Perhaps he felt (who\nknows?) just for a moment, that in the dimness of those enormous\naisles was something he had lost a long, long while ago.\n\nOne is not mistaken to credit the very bad with feeling far, faint\nappeals from things of glory like Cologne Cathedral; it is that the\nappeals come to them too far and faint on their headlong descent to\nruin.\n\nFor what was the War Lord seeking? Did he know that pity for his poor\nslaughtered people, huddled by him on to our ceaseless machine guns,\nmight be found by seeking there? Or was it only that the lost thing,\nwhatever it was, made that faint appeal to him, passing the door by\nchance, and drew him in, as the scent of some herb or flower in a\nmoment draws us back years to look for something lost in our youth; we\ngaze back, wondering, and do not find it.\n\nAnd to think that perhaps he lost it by very little! That, but for\nthat proud attitude and the respectful staff, he might have seen what\nwas lost, and have come out bringing pity for his people. Might have\nsaid to the crowd that gave him that ovation, as we read, outside the\ndoor: \"My pride has driven you to this needless war, my ambition has\nmade a sacrifice of millions, but it is over, and it shall be no more;\nI will make no more conquests.\"\n\nThey would have killed him. But for that renunciation, perhaps,\nhowever late, the curses of the widows of his people might have kept\naway from his grave.\n\nBut he did not find it. He sat at prayer. Then he stood. Then he\nmarched out: and his staff marched out behind him. And in the gloom of\nthe floor of the vast Cologne Cathedral lie the things that the Kaiser\ndid not find and never will find now. Unnoticed thus, and in some\nsilent moment, passes a man's last chance.\n\n\n\n\nThe Last Mirage\n\n\nThe desolation that the German offensive has added to the dominions of\nthe Kaiser cannot easily be imagined by any one who has never seen a\ndesert. Look at it on the map and it is full of the names of towns and\nvillages; it is in Europe, where there are no deserts; it is a fertile\nprovince among places of famous names. Surely it is a proud addition\nto an ambitious monarch's possessions. Surely there is something there\nthat it is worth while to have conquered at the cost of army corps.\nNo, nothing. They are mirage towns. The farms grow Dead Sea fruit.\nFrance recedes before the imperial clutch. France smiles, but not for\nhim. His new towns seem to be his because their names have not yet\nbeen removed from any map, but they crumble at his approach because\nFrance is not for him. His deadly ambition makes a waste before it as\nit goes, clutching for cities. It comes to them and the cities are not\nthere.\n\nI have seen mirages and have heard others told of, but the best\nmirages of all we never hear described; the mirage that waterless\ntravellers see at the last. Those fountains rising out of onyx basins,\nblue and straight into incredible heights, and falling and flooding\ncool white marble; the haze of spray above their feathery heads\nthrough which the pale green domes of weathered copper shimmer and\nshake a little; mysterious temples, the tombs of unknown kings; the\ncataracts coming down from rose-quartz cliffs, far off but seen quite\nclearly, growing to rivers bearing curious barges to the golden courts\nof Sahara. These things we never see; they are seen at the last by men\nwho die of thirst.\n\nEven so has the Kaiser looked at the smiling plains of France. Even so\nhas he looked on her famous ancient cities and the farms and the\nfertile fields and the woods and orchards of Picardy. With effort and\ntrouble he has moved towards them. As he comes near to them the cities\ncrumble, the woods shrivel and fall, the farms fade out of Picardy,\neven the hedgerows go; it is bare, bare desert. He had been sure of\nParis, he had dreamed of Versailles and some monstrous coronation, he\nhad thought his insatiable avarice would be sated. For he had plotted\nfor conquest of the world, that boundless greed of his goading him on\nas a man in the grip of thirst broods upon lakes.\n\nHe sees victory near him now. That also will fade in the desert of old\nbarbed wire and weeds. When will he see that a doom is over all his\nambitions? For his dreams of victory are like those last dreams that\ncome in deceptive deserts to dying men.\n\nThere is nothing good for him in the desert of the Somme. Bapaume is\nnot really there, though it be marked on his maps; it is only a\nwilderness of slates and brick. Peronne looks like a city a long way\noff, but when you come near it is only the shells of houses. Pozi\u00e8re,\nLe Sars, Sapigny, are gone altogether.\n\nAnd all is Dead Sea fruit in a visible desert. The reports of German\nvictories there are mirage like all the rest; they too will fade into\nweeds and old barbed wire.\n\nAnd the advances that look like victories, and the ruins that look\nlike cities, and the shell-beaten broken fields that look like\nfarms,--they and the dreams of conquest and all the plots and ambitions,\nthey are all the mirage of a dying dynasty in a desert it made for its\ndoom.\n\nBones lead up to the desert, bones are scattered about it, it is the\nmost menacing and calamitous waste of all the deadly places that have\nbeen inclement to man. It flatters the Hohenzollerns with visions of\nvictory now because they are doomed by it and are about to die. When\ntheir race has died the earth shall smile again, for their deadly\nmirage shall oppress us no more. The cities shall rise again and the\nfarms come back; hedgerows and orchards shall be seen again; the woods\nshall slowly lift their heads from the dust; and gardens shall come\nagain where the desert was, to bloom in happier ages that forget the\nHohenzollerns.\n\n\n\n\nA Famous Man\n\n\nLast winter a famous figure walked in Behagnies. Soldiers came to see\nhim from their billets all down the Arras road, from Ervillers and\nfrom Sapigny, and from the ghosts of villages back from the road,\nplaces that once were villages but are only names now. They would walk\nthree or four miles, those who could not get lorries, for his was one\nof those names that all men know, not such a name as a soldier or poet\nmay win, but a name that all men know. They used to go there at\nevening.\n\nFour miles away on the left as you went from Ervillers, the guns\nmumbled over the hills, low hills over which the Verys from the\ntrenches put up their heads and peered around,--greeny, yellowy\nheads that turned the sky sickly, and the clouds lit up and went grey\nagain all the night long. As you got near to Behagnies you lost sight\nof the Verys, but the guns mumbled on. A silly little train used to\nrun on one's left, which used to whistle loudly, as though it asked to\nbe shelled, but I never saw a shell coming its way; perhaps it knew\nthat the German gunners could not calculate how slow it went. It\ncrossed the road as you got down to Behagnies.\n\nYou passed the graves of two or three German soldiers with their names\non white wooden crosses,--men killed in 1914; and then a little\ncemetery of a French cavalry regiment, where a big cross stood in the\nmiddle with a wreath and a tricolor badge, and the names of the men.\nAnd then one saw trees. That was always a wonder, whether one saw\ntheir dark shapes in the evening, or whether one saw them by day, and\nknew from the look of their leaves whether autumn had come yet, or\ngone. In winter at evening one just saw the black bulk of them, but\nthat was no less marvellous than seeing them green in summer; trees by\nthe side of the Arras-Bapaume road, trees in mid-desert in the awful\nregion of Somme. There were not many of them, just a cluster, fewer\nthan the date palms in an oasis in Sahara, but an oasis is an oasis\nwherever you find it, and a few trees make it. There are little places\nhere and there, few enough as the Arabs know, that the Sahara's deadly\nsand has never been able to devastate; and there are places even in\nthe Somme that German malice, obeying the Kaiser as the sand of Sahara\nobeys the accursed sirocco, has not been able to destroy quite to the\nuttermost. That little cluster of trees at Behagnies is one of these;\nDivisional Headquarters used to shelter beneath them; and near them\nwas a statue on a lawn which probably stood by the windows of some\nfine house, though there is no trace of the house but the lawn and\nthat statue now.\n\nAnd over the way on the left a little further on, just past the\nofficers' club, a large hall stood where one saw that famous figure,\nwhom officers and men alike would come so far to see.\n\nThe hall would hold perhaps four or five hundred seats in front of a\nstage fitted up very simply with red, white and blue cloths, but\nfitted up by some one that understood the job; and at the back of that\nstage on those winter evenings walked on his flat and world-renowned\nfeet the figure of Charlie Chaplin.\n\nWhen a\u00ebroplanes came over bombing, the dynamos used to stop for they\nsupplied light to other places besides the cinema, and the shade of\nCharlie Chaplin would fade away. But the men would wait till the\na\u00ebroplanes had gone and that famous figure came waddling back to the\nscreen. There he amused tired men newly come from the trenches, there\nhe brought laughter to most of the twelve days that they had out of\nthe line.\n\nHe is gone from Behagnies now. He did not march in the retreat a\nlittle apart from the troops, with head bent forward and hand thrust\nin jacket, a flat-footed Napoleon: yet he is gone; for no one would\nhave left behind for the enemy so precious a thing as a Charlie\nChaplin film. He is gone but he will return. He will come with his\ncane one day along that Arras road to the old hut in Behagnies; and\nmen dressed in brown will welcome him there again.\n\nHe will pass beyond it through those desolate plains, and over the\nhills beyond them, beyond Bapaume. Far hamlets to the east will know\nhis antics.\n\nAnd one day surely, in old familiar garb, without court dress, without\nremoving his hat, armed with that flexible cane, he will walk over the\nfaces of the Prussian Guard and, picking up the Kaiser by the collar,\nwith infinite nonchalance in finger and thumb, will place him neatly\nin a prone position and solemnly sit on his chest.\n\n\n\n\nThe Oases of Death\n\n\nWhile the German guns were pounding Amiens and the battle of dull\nPrussianism against Liberty raged on, they buried Richthofen in the\nBritish lines.\n\nThey had laid him in a large tent with his broken machine outside it.\nThence British airmen carried him to the quiet cemetery, and he was\nburied among the cypresses in this old resting place of French\ngenerations just as though he had come there bringing no harm to\nFrance.\n\nFive wreaths were on his coffin, placed there by those who had fought\nagainst him up in the air. And under the wreaths on the coffin was\nspread the German flag.\n\nWhen the funeral service was over three volleys were fired by the\nescort, and a hundred aviators paid their last respects to the grave\nof their greatest enemy; for the chivalry that the Prussians have\ndriven from earth and sea lives on in the blue spaces of the air.\n\nThey buried Richthofen at evening, and the planes came droning home as\nthey buried him, and the German guns roared on and guns answered,\ndefending Amiens. And in spite of all, the cemetery had the air of\nquiet, remaining calm and aloof, as all French graveyards are. For\nthey seem to have no part in the cataclysm that shakes all the world\nbut them; they seem to withdraw amongst memories and to be aloof from\ntime, and, above all, to be quite untroubled by the war that rages\nto-day, upon which they appear to look out listlessly from among their\ncypress and yew, and dimly, down a vista of centuries. They are very\nstrange, these little oases of death that remain unmoved and green\nwith their trees still growing, in the midst of a desolation as far as\nthe eye can see, in which cities and villages and trees and hedges and\nfarms and fields and churches are all gone, and where hugely broods a\ndesert. It is as though Death, stalking up and down through France for\nfour years, sparing nothing, had recognized for his own his little\ngardens, and had spared only them.\n\n\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon Tyranny\n\n\n\"We need a sea,\" says Big-Admiral von Tirpitz, \"freed of\nAnglo-Saxon tyranny.\" Unfortunately neither the British Admiralty nor\nthe American Navy permit us to know how much of the Anglo-Saxon\ntyranny is done by American destroyers and how much by British ships\nand even trawler. It would interest both countries to know, if it\ncould be known. But the Big-Admiral is unjust to France, for the\nFrench navy exerts a tyranny at sea that can by no means be\noverlooked, although naturally from her position in front of the mouth\nof the Elbe England practises the culminating insupportable tyranny of\nkeeping the High Seas Fleet in the Kiel Canal.\n\nIt is not I, but the Big-Admiral, who chose the word tyranny as\ndescriptive of the activities of the Anglo-Saxon navies. He was making\na speech at Dusseldorf on May 25th and was reported in the\nDusseldorfer Nachrichten on May 27th.\n\nNaturally it does not seem like tyranny to us, even the contrary; but\nfor an admiral, ein Grosse-Admiral, lately commanding a High Seas\nFleet, it must have been more galling than we perhaps can credit to be\nconfined in a canal. There was he, who should have been breasting the\nblue, or at any rate doing something salty and nautical, far out in\nthe storms of that sea that the Germans call an Ocean, with the\nhurricane raging angrily in his whiskers and now and then wafting\ntufts of them aloft to white the halyards; there was he constrained to\na command the duties of which however nobly he did them could be\nequally well carried out by any respectable bargee. He hoped for a\npiracy of which the Lusitania was merely a beginning; he looked for\nthe bombardment of innumerable towns; he pictured slaughter in many a\nhamlet of fishermen; he planned more than all those things of which\nU-boat commanders are guilty; he saw himself a murderous old man,\nterrible to seafarers, and a scourge of the coasts, and fancied\nhimself chronicled in after years by such as told dark tales of\nCaptain Kidd or the awful buccaneers; but he followed in the end no\nmore desperate courses than to sit and watch his ships on a wharf near\nKiel like one of Jacob's night watchmen.\n\nNo wonder that what appears to us no more than the necessary\nprotection of women and children in seacoast towns from murder should\nbe to him an intolerable tyranny. No wonder that the guarding of\ntravellers of the allied countries at sea, and even those of the\nneutrals, should be a most galling thing to the Big-Admiral's thwarted\nambition, looking at it from the point of view of one who to\nwhite-whiskered age has retained the schoolboy's natural love of the\nblack and yellow flag. A pirate, he would say, has as much right to\nlive as wasps or tigers. The Anglo-Saxon navies, he might argue, have\na certain code of rules for use at sea; they let women get first into\nthe boats, for instance, when ships are sinking, and they rescue\ndrowning mariners when they can: no actual harm in all this, he would\nfeel, though it would weaken you, as Hindenburg said of poetry; but if\nall these little rules are tyrannously enforced on those who may think\nthem silly, what is to become of the pirate? Where, if people like\nBeattie and Sims had always had their way, would be those rollicking\ntales of the jolly Spanish Main, and men walking the plank into the\nbig blue sea, and long, low, rakish craft putting in to Indian\nharbours with a cargo of men and women all hung from the yard-arm? A\nmelancholy has come over the spirit of Big-Admiral von Tirpitz in the\nyears he has spent in the marshes between the Elbe and Kiel, and in\nthat melancholy he sees romance crushed; he sees no more pearl\nearrings and little gold rings in the hold, he sees British\nbattleships spoiling the Spanish Main, and hateful American cruisers\nin the old Sargasso Sea; he sees himself, alas, the last of all the\npirates.\n\nLet him take comfort. There were always pirates. And in spite of the\ntyranny of England and America, and of France, which the poor old man\nperplexed with his troubles forgot, there will be pirates still. Not\nmany perhaps, but enough U-boats will always be able to slip through\nthat tyrannous blockade to spread indiscriminate slaughter amongst the\ntravellers of any nation, enough to hand on the old traditions of\nmurder at sea. And one day Captain Kidd, with such a bow as they used\nto make in ports of the Spanish Main, will take off his ancient hat,\nsweeping it low in Hell, and be proud to clasp the hand of the Lord of\nthe Kiel Canal.\n\n\n\n\nMemories\n\n\n  ... far-off things\n     And battles long ago.\n\n\nThose who live in an old house are necessarily more concerned with\npaying the plumber, should his art be required, or choosing wall paper\nthat does not clash with the chintzes, than with the traditions that\nmay haunt its corridors. In Ireland,--and no one knows how old that\nis, for the gods that lived there before the Red Branch came wrote few\nchronicles on the old grey Irish stones and wrote in their own\nlanguage,--in Ireland we are more concerned with working it so that\nTim Flanagan gets the job he does be looking for.\n\nBut in America those who remember Ireland remember her, very often,\nfrom old generations; maybe their grandfather migrated, perhaps his\ngrandfather, and Ireland is remembered by old tales treasured among\nthem. Now Tim Flanagan will not be remembered in a year's time when he\nhas the job for which he has got us to agitate, and the jobberies that\nstir us move not the pen of History.\n\nBut the tales that Irish generations hand down beyond the Atlantic\nhave to be tales that are worth remembering. They are tales that have\nto stand the supreme test, tales that a child will listen to by the\nfireside of an evening, so that they go down with those early\nremembered evenings that are last of all to go of the memories of a\nlifetime. A tale that a child will listen to must have much grandeur.\nAny cheap stuff will do for us, bad journalism, and novels by girls\nthat could get no other jobs; but a child looks for those things in a\ntale that are simple and noble and epic, the things that Earth\nremembers. And so they tell, over there, tales of Sarsfield and of the\nold Irish Brigade; they tell, of an evening, of Owen Roe O'Neill. And\ninto those tales come the plains of Flanders again and the ancient\ntowns of France, towns famous long ago and famous yet: let us rather\nthink of them as famous names and not as the sad ruins we have seen,\nmelancholy by day and monstrous in the moonlight.\n\nMany an Irishman who sails from America for those historic lands knows\nthat the old trees that stand there have their roots far down in soil\nonce richened by Irish blood. When the Boyne was lost and won, and\nIreland had lost her King, many an Irishman with all his wealth in a\nscabbard looked upon exile as his sovereign's court. And so they came\nto the lands of foreign kings, with nothing to offer for the\nhospitality that was given them but a sword; and it usually was a\nsword with which kings were well content. Louis XV had many of them,\nand was glad to have them at Fontenoy; the Spanish King admitted them\nto the Golden Fleece; they defended Maria Theresa. Landen in Flanders\nand Cremona knew them. A volume were needed to tell of all those\nswords; more than one Muse has remembered them. It was not disloyalty\nthat drove them forth; their King was gone, they followed, the oak was\nsmitten and brown were the leaves of the tree.\n\nBut no such mournful metaphor applies to the men who march to-day\ntowards the plains where the \"Wild Geese\" were driven. They go with\nno country mourning them, but their whole land cheers them on; they go\nto the inherited battlefields. And there is this difference in their\nattitude to kings, that those knightly Irishmen of old, driven\nhomeless over-sea, appeared as exiles suppliant for shelter before the\nface of the Grand Monarch, and he, no doubt with exquisite French\ngrace, gave back to them all they had lost except what was lost\nforever, salving so far as he could the injustice suffered by each.\nBut to-day when might, for its turn, is in the hands of democracies,\nthe men whose fathers built the Statue of Liberty have left their\ncountry to bring back an exiled king to his home, and to right what\ncan be righted of the ghastly wrongs of Flanders.\n\nAnd if men's prayers are heard, as many say, old saints will hear old\nsupplications going up by starlight with a certain wistful, musical\nintonation that has linked the towns of Limerick and Cork with the\nfields of Flanders before.\n\n\n\n\nThe Movement\n\n\nFor many years Eliphaz Griggs was comparatively silent. Not that he\ndid not talk on all occasions whenever he could find hearers, he did\nthat at great length; but for many years he addressed no public\nmeeting, and was no part of the normal life of the northeast end of\nHyde Park or Trafalgar Square. And then one day he was talking in a\npublic house where he had gone to talk on the only subject that was\ndear to him. He waited, as was his custom, until five or six men were\npresent, and then he began. \"Ye're all damned, I'm saying, damned\nfrom the day you were born. Your portion is Tophet.\"\n\nAnd on that day there happened what had never happened in his\nexperience before. Men used to listen in a tolerant way, and say\nlittle over their beer, for that is the English custom; and that would\nbe all. But to-day a man rose up with flashing eyes and went over to\nEliphaz and gripped him by the hand: \"They're all damned,\" said the\nstranger.\n\nThat was the turning point in the life of Eliphaz. Up to that moment\nhe had been a lonely crank, and men thought he was queer; but now\nthere were two of them and he became a Movement. A Movement in England\nmay do what it likes: there was a Movement, before the War, for\nspoiling tulips in Kew Gardens and breaking church windows; it had its\nrun like the rest.\n\nThe name of Eliphaz's new friend was Ezekiel Pim: and they drew up\nrules for their Movement almost at once; and very soon country inns\nknew Eliphaz no more. And for some while they missed him where he used\nto drop in of an evening to tell them they were all damned: and then a\nman proved one day that the earth was flat, and they all forgot\nEliphaz.\n\nBut Eliphaz went to Hyde Park and Ezekiel Pim went with him, and there\nyou would see them close to the Marble Arch on any fine Sunday\nafternoon, preaching their Movement to the people of London. \"You are\nall damned,\" said Eliphaz. \"Your portion shall be damnation for\neverlasting.\"\n\n\"All damned,\" added Ezekiel.\n\nEliphaz was the orator. He would picture Hell to you as it really is.\nHe made you see pretty much what it will be like to wriggle and turn\nand squirm, and never escape from burning. But Ezekiel Pim, though he\nseldom said more than three words, uttered those words with such\nalarming sincerity and had such a sure conviction shining in his eyes\nthat searched right in your face as he said them, and his long hair\nwaved so weirdly as his head shot forward when he said \"You're all\ndamned,\" that Ezekiel Pim brought home to you that the vivid\ndescriptions of Eliphaz really applied to you.\n\nPeople who lead bad lives get their sensibilities hardened. These did\nnot care very much what Eliphaz said. But girls at school, and several\ngovernesses, and even some young clergy, were very much affected.\nEliphaz Griggs and Ezekiel Pim seemed to bring Hell so near to you.\nYou could almost feel it baking the Marble Arch from two to four on\nSundays. And at four o'clock the Surbiton Branch of the International\nAnarchists used to come along, and Eliphaz Griggs and Ezekiel Pim\nwould pack up their flag and go, for the pitch belonged to the\nSurbiton people till six; and the crank Movements punctiliously\nrecognize each other's rights. If they fought among themselves, which\nis quite unthinkable, the police would run them in; it is the one\nthing that an anarchist in England may never do.\n\nWhen the War came the two speakers doubled their efforts. The way they\nlooked at it was that here was a counter-attraction taking people's\nminds off the subject of their own damnation just as they had got them\nto think about it. Eliphaz worked as he had never worked before; he\nspared nobody; but it was still Ezekiel Pim who somehow brought it\nmost home to them.\n\nOne fine spring afternoon Eliphaz Griggs was speaking at his usual\nplace and time; he had wound himself up wonderfully. \"You are\ndamned,\" he was saying, \"for ever and ever and ever. Your sins have\nfound you out. Your filthy lives will be as fuel round you and shall\nburn for ever and ever.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said a Canadian soldier in the crowd, \"we shouldn't\nallow that in Ottawa.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked an English girl.\n\n\"Why, telling us we're all damned like that,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, this is England,\" she said. \"They may all say what they like\nhere.\"\n\n\"You are all damned,\" said Ezekiel, jerking forward his head and\nshoulders till his hair flapped out behind. \"All, all, all damned.\"\n\n\"I'm damned if I am,\" said the Canadian soldier.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Ezekiel, and a sly look came into his face.\n\nEliphaz flamed on. \"Your sins are remembered. Satan shall grin at\nyou. He shall heap cinders on you for ever and ever. Woe to you,\nfilthy livers. Woe to you, sinners. Hell is your portion. There shall\nbe none to grieve for you. You shall dwell in torment for ages. None\nshall be spared, not one. Woe everlasting... Oh, I beg pardon,\ngentlemen, I'm sure.\" For the Pacifists' League had been kept waiting\nthree minutes. It was their turn to-day at four.\n\n\n\n\nNature's Cad\n\n\nThe claim of Professor Grotius Jan Beek to have discovered, or\nlearned, the language of the greater apes has been demonstrated\nclearly enough. He is not the original discoverer of the fact that\nthey have what may be said to correspond with a language; nor is he\nthe first man to have lived for some while in the jungle protected by\nwooden bars, with a view to acquiring some knowledge of the meaning of\nthe various syllables that gorillas appear to utter. If so crude a\ncollection of sounds, amounting to less than a hundred words, if words\nthey are, may be called a language, it may be admitted that the\nProfessor has learned it, as his recent experiments show. What he has\nnot proved is his assertion that he has actually conversed with a\ngorilla, or by signs, or grunts, or any means whatever obtained an\ninsight, as he put it, into its mentality, or, as we should put it,\nits point of view. This Professor Beek claims to have done; and though\nhe gives us a certain plausible corroboration of a kind which makes\nhis story appear likely, it should be borne in mind that it is not of\nthe nature of proof.\n\nThe Professor's story is briefly that having acquired this language,\nwhich nobody that has witnessed his experiments will call in question,\nhe went back to the jungle for a week, living all the time in the\nordinary explorer's cage of the Blik pattern. Towards the very end of\nthe week a big male gorilla came by, and the Professor attracted it by\nthe one word \"Food.\" It came, he says, close to the cage, and seemed\nprepared to talk but became very angry on seeing a man there, and beat\nthe cage and would say nothing. The Professor says that he asked it\nwhy it was angry. He admits that he had learned no more than forty\nwords of this language, but believes that there are perhaps thirty\nmore. Much however is expressed, as he says, by mere intonation.\nAnger, for instance; and scores of allied words, such as terrible,\nfrightful, kill, whether noun, verb or adjective, are expressed, he\nsays, by a mere growl. Nor is there any word for \"Why,\" but queries\nare signified by the inflexion of the voice.\n\nWhen he asked it why it was angry the gorilla said that men killed\nhim, and added a noise that the professor said was evidently meant to\nallude to guns. The only word used, he says, in this remark of the\ngorilla's was the word that signified \"man.\" The sentence as\nunderstood by the professor amounted to \"Man kill me. Guns.\" But the\nword \"kill\" was represented simply by a snarl, \"me\" by slapping\nits chest, and \"guns\" as I have explained was only represented by a\nnoise. The Professor believes that ultimately a word for guns may be\nevolved out of that noise, but thinks that it will take many\ncenturies, and that if during that time guns should cease to be in\nuse, this stimulus being withdrawn, the word will never be evolved at\nall, nor of course will it be needed.\n\nThe Professor tried, by evincing interest, ignorance, and incredulity,\nand even indignation, to encourage the gorilla to say more; but to his\ndisappointment, all the more intense after having exchanged that one\nword of conversation with one of the beasts, the gorilla only repeated\nwhat it had said, and beat on the cage again. For half an hour this\nwent on, the Professor showing every sign of sympathy, the gorilla\nraging and beating upon the cage.\n\nIt was half an hour of the most intense excitement to the Professor,\nduring which time he saw the realization of dreams that many\nconsidered crazy, glittering as it were within his grasp, and all the\nwhile this ridiculous gorilla would do nothing but repeat the mere\nshred of a sentence and beat the cage with its great hands; and the\nheat of course was intense. And by the end of the half hour the\nexcitement and the heat seem to have got the better of the Professor's\ntemper, and he waved the disgusting brute angrily away with a gesture\nthat probably was not much less impatient than the gorilla's own. And\nat that the animal suddenly became voluble. He beat more furiously\nthan ever upon the cage and slipped his great fingers through the\nbars, trying to reach the Professor, and poured out volumes of\nape-chatter.\n\nWhy, why did men shoot at him, he asked. He made himself terrible,\ntherefore men ought to love him. That was the whole burden of what the\nProfessor calls its argument. \"Me, me terrible,\" two slaps on the\nchest and then a growl. \"Man love me.\" And then the emphatic\nnegative word, and the sound that meant guns, and sudden furious\nrushes at the cage to try to get at the Professor.\n\nThe gorilla, Professor Beek explains, evidently admired only strength;\nwhenever he said \"I make myself terrible to Man,\" a sentence he\noften repeated, he drew himself up and thrust out his huge chest and\nbared his frightful teeth; and certainly, the Professor says, there\nwas something terribly grand about the menacing brute. \"Me\nterrible,\" he repeated again and again, \"Me terrible. Sky, sun,\nstars with me. Man love me. Man love me. No?\" It meant that all the\ngreat forces of nature assisted him and his terrible teeth, which he\ngnashed repeatedly, and that therefore man should love him, and he\nopened his great jaws wide as he said this, showing all the brutal\nforce of them.\n\nThere was to my mind a genuine ring in Professor Beek's story, because\nhe was obviously so much more concerned, and really troubled, by the\ndreadful depravity of this animal's point of view, or mentality as he\ncalled it, than he was concerned with whether or not we believed what\nhe had said.\n\nAnd I mentioned that there was a circumstance in his story of a\nplausible and even corroborative nature. It is this. Professor Beek,\nwho noticed at the time a bullet wound in the tip of the gorilla's\nleft ear, by means of which it was luckily identified, put his\nanalysis of its mentality in writing and showed it to several others,\nbefore he had any way of accounting for the beast having such a mind.\n\nLong afterwards it was definitely ascertained that this animal had\nbeen caught when young on the slopes of Kilimanjaro and trained and\neven educated, so far as such things are possible, by an eminent\nGerman Professor, a persona grata at the Court of Berlin.\n\n\n\n\nThe Home of Herr Schnitzelhaaser\n\n\nThe guns in the town of Greinstein were faintly audible. The family of\nSchnitzelhaaser lived alone there in mourning, an old man and old\nwoman. They never went out or saw any one, for they knew they could\nnot speak as though they did not mourn. They feared that their secret\nwould escape them. They had never cared for the war that the War Lord\nmade. They no longer cared what he did with it. They never read his\nspeeches; they never hung out flags when he ordered flags: they hadn't\nthe heart to.\n\nThey had had four sons.\n\nThe lonely old couple would go as far as the shop for food. Hunger\nstalked behind them. They just beat hunger every day, and so saw\nevening: but there was nothing to spare. Otherwise they did not go out\nat all. Hunger had been coming slowly nearer of late. They had nothing\nbut the ration, and the ration was growing smaller. They had one pig\nof their own, but the law said you might not kill it. So the pig was\nno good to them.\n\nThey used to go and look at that pig sometimes when hunger pinched.\nBut more than that they did not dare to contemplate.\n\nHunger came nearer and nearer. The war was going to end by the first\nof July. The War Lord was going to take Paris on this day and that\nwould end the war at once. But then the war was always going to end.\nIt was going to end in 1914, and their four sons were to have come\nhome when the leaves fell. The War Lord had promised that. And even if\nit did end, that would not bring their four sons home now. So what did\nit matter what the War Lord said.\n\nIt was thoughts like these that they knew they had to conceal. It was\nbecause of thoughts like these that they did not trust themselves to\ngo out and see other people, for they feared that by their looks if by\nnothing else, or by their silence or perhaps their tears, they might\nimply a blasphemy against the All Highest. And hunger made one so\nhasty. What might one not say? And so they stayed indoors.\n\nBut now. What would happen now? The War Lord was coming to Greinstein\nin order to hear the guns. One officer of the staff was to be billeted\nin their house. And what would happen now?\n\nThey talked the whole thing over. They must struggle and make an\neffort. The officer would be there for one evening. He would leave in\nthe morning quite early in order to make things ready for the return\nto Potsdam: he had charge of the imperial car. So for one evening they\nmust be merry. They would suppose, it was Herr Schnitzelhaaser's\nsuggestion, they would think all the evening that Belgium and France\nand Luxemburg all attacked the Fatherland, and that the Kaiser,\nutterly unprepared, quite unprepared, called on the Germans to defend\ntheir land against Belgium.\n\nYes, the old woman could imagine that; she could think it all the\nevening.\n\nAnd then,--it was no use not being cheerful altogether,--then one\nmust imagine a little more, just for the evening: it would come quite\neasy; one must think that the four boys were alive.\n\nHans too? (Hans was the youngest).\n\nYes, all four. Just for the evening.\n\nBut if the officer asks?\n\nHe will not ask. What are four soldiers?\n\nSo it was all arranged; and at evening the officer came. He brought\nhis own rations, so hunger came no nearer. Hunger just lay down\noutside the door and did not notice the officer.\n\nA this supper the officer began to talk. The Kaiser himself, he said,\nwas at the Schartzhaus.\n\n\"So,\" said Herr Schnitzelhaaser; \"just over the way.\" So close.\nSuch an honour.\n\nAnd indeed the shadow of the Schartzhaus darkened their garden in the\nmorning.\n\nIt was such an honour, said Frau Schnitzelhaaser too. And they began\nto praise the Kaiser. So great a War Lord, she said; the most glorious\nwar there had ever been.\n\nOf course, said the officer, it would end on the first of July.\n\nOf course, said Frau Schnitzelhaaser. And so great an admiral, too.\nOne must remember that also. And how fortunate we were to have him:\none must not forget that. Had it not been for him the crafty Belgians\nwould have attacked the Fatherland, but they were struck down before\nthey could do it. So much better to prevent a bad deed like that than\nmerely to punish after. So wise. And had it not been for him, if it\nhad not been for him...\n\nThe old man saw that she was breaking down and hastily he took up that\nfeverish praise. Feverish it was, for their hunger and bitter loss\naffected their minds no less than illness does, and the things they\ndid they did hastily and intemperately. His praise of the War Lord\nraced on as the officer ate. He spoke of him as of those that benefit\nman, as of monarchs who bring happiness to their people. And now, he\nsaid, he is here in the Schartzhaus beside us, listening to the guns\njust like a common soldier.\n\nFinally the guns, as he spoke, coughed beyond ominous hills.\nContentedly the officer went on eating. He suspected nothing of the\nthoughts his host and hostess were hiding. At last he went upstairs to\nbed.\n\nAs fierce exertion is easy to the fevered, so they had spoken; and it\nwears them, so they were worn. The old woman wept when the officer\nwent out of hearing. But old Herr Schnitzelhaaser picked up a big\nbutcher's knife. \"I will bear it no more,\" he said.\n\nHis wife watched him in silence as he went away with his knife. Out of\nthe house he went and into the night. Through the open door she saw\nnothing; all was dark; even the Schartzhaus, where all was gay\nto-night, stood dark for fear of a\u00ebroplanes. The old woman waited in\nsilence.\n\nWhen Herr Schnitzelhaaser returned there was blood on his knife.\n\n\"What have you done?\" the old woman asked him quite calmly. \"I have\nkilled our pig,\" he said.\n\nShe broke out then, all the more recklessly for the long restraint of\nthe evening; the officer must have heard her.\n\n\"We are lost! We are lost!\" she cried. \"We may not kill our pig.\nHunger has made you mad. You have ruined us.\"\n\n\"I will bear it no longer,\" he said. \"I have killed our pig.\"\n\n\"But they will never let us eat it,\" she cried. \"Oh, you have\nruined us!\"\n\n\"If you did not dare to kill our pig,\" he said, \"why did you not\nstop me when you saw me go? You saw me go with the knife?\"\n\n\"I thought,\" she said, \"you were going to kill the Kaiser.\"\n\n\n\n\nA Deed of Mercy\n\n\nAs Hindenburg and the Kaiser came down, as we read, from Mont d'Hiver,\nduring the recent offensive, they saw on the edge of a crater two\nwounded British soldiers. The Kaiser ordered that they should be cared\nfor: their wounds were bound up and they were given brandy, and\nbrought round from unconsciousness. That is the German account of it,\nand it may well be true. It was a kindly act.\n\nProbably had it not been for this the two men would have died among\nthose desolate craters; no one would have known, and no one could have\nbeen blamed for it.\n\nThe contrast of this spark of imperial kindness against the gloom of\nthe background of the war that the Kaiser made is a pleasant thing to\nsee, even though it illuminates for only a moment the savage darkness\nin which our days are plunged. It was a kindness that probably will\nlong be remembered to him. Even we, his enemies, will remember it. And\nwho knows but that when most he needs it his reward for the act will\nbe given him.\n\nFor Judas, they say, once in his youth, gave his cloak, out of\ncompassion, to a shivering beggar, who sat shaken with ague, in rags,\nin bitter need. And the years went by and Judas forgot his deed. And\nlong after, in Hell, Judas they say was given one day's respite at the\nend of every year because of this one kindness he had done so long\nsince in his youth. And every year he goes, they say, for a day and\ncools himself among the Arctic bergs; once every year for century\nafter century.\n\nPerhaps some sailor on watch on a misty evening blown far out of his\ncourse away to the north saw something ghostly once on an iceberg\nfloating by, or heard some voice in the dimness that seemed like the\nvoice of man, and came home with this weird story. And perhaps, as the\nstory passed from lip to lip, men found enough justice in it to\nbelieve it true. So it came down the centuries.\n\nWill seafarers ages hence on dim October evenings, or on nights when\nthe moon is ominous through mist, red and huge and uncanny, see a\nlonely figure sometimes on the loneliest part of the sea, far north of\nwhere the Lusitania sank, gathering all the cold it can? Will they see\nit hugging a crag of iceberg wan as itself, helmet, cuirass and ice\npale-blue in the mist together? Will it look towards them with\nice-blue eyes through the mist, and will they question it, meeting on\nthose bleak seas? Will it answer--or will the North wind howl like\nvoices? Will the cry of seals be heard, and ice floes grinding, and\nstrange birds lost upon the wind that night, or will it speak to them\nin those distant years and tell them how it sinned, betraying man?\n\nIt will be a grim, dark story in that lonely part of the sea, when he\nconfesses to sailors, blown too far north, the dreadful thing he\nplotted against man. The date on which he is seen will be told from\nsailor to sailor. Queer taverns of distant harbours will know it well.\nNot many will care to be at sea that day, and few will risk being\ndriven by stress of weather on the Kaiser's night to the bergs of the\nhaunted part of sea.\n\nAnd yet for all the grimness of the pale-blue phantom, with cuirass\nand helmet and eyes shimmering on deadly icebergs, and yet for all the\nsorrow of the wrong he did against man, the women drowned and the\nchildren, and all the good ships gone, yet will the horrified mariners\nmeeting him in the mist grudge him no moment of the day he has earned,\nor the coolness he gains from the bergs, because of the kindness he\ndid to the wounded men. For the mariners in their hearts are kindly\nmen, and what a soul gains from kindness will seem to them well\ndeserved.\n\n\n\n\nLast Scene of All\n\n\nAfter John Calleron was hit he carried on in a kind of twilight of the\nmind. Things grew dimmer and calmer; harsh outlines of events became\nblurred; memories came to him; there was a singing in his ears like\nfar-off bells. Things seemed more beautiful than they had a while ago;\nto him it was for all the world like evening after some quiet sunset,\nwhen lawns and shrubs and woods and some old spire look lovely in the\nlate light, and one reflects on past days. Thus he carried on, seeing\nthings dimly. And what is sometimes called \"the roar of battle,\"\nthose a\u00ebrial voices that snarl and moan and whine and rage at\nsoldiers, had grown dimmer too. It all seemed further away, and\nlittler, as far things are. He still heard the bullets: there is\nsomething so violently and intensely sharp in the snap of passing\nbullets at short ranges that you hear them in deepest thought, and\neven in dreams. He heard them, tearing by, above all things else. The\nrest seemed fainter and dimmer, and smaller and further away.\n\nHe did not think he was very badly hit, but nothing seemed to matter\nas it did a while ago. Yet he carried on.\n\nAnd then he opened his eyes very wide and found he was back in London\nagain in an underground train. He knew it at once by the look of it.\nHe had made hundreds of journeys, long ago, by those trains. He knew\nby the dark, outside, that it had not yet left London; but what was\nodder than that, if one stopped to think of it, was that he knew\nexactly where it was going. It was the train that went away out into\nthe country where he used to live as a boy. He was sure of that\nwithout thinking.\n\nWhen he began to think how he came to be there he remembered the war\nas a very far-off thing. He supposed he had been unconscious a very\nlong time. He was all right now.\n\nOther people were sitting beside him on the same seat. They all seemed\nlike people he remembered a very long time ago. In the darkness\nopposite, beyond the windows of the train, he could see their\nreflections clearly. He looked at the reflections but could not quite\nremember.\n\nA woman was sitting on his left. She was quite young. She was more\nlike some one that he most deeply remembered than all the others were.\nHe gazed at her, and tried to clear his mind.\n\nHe did not turn and stare at her, but he quietly watched her\nreflection before him in the dark. Every detail of her dress, her\nyoung face, her hat, the little ornaments she wore, were minutely\nclear before him, looking out of the dark. So contented she looked you\nwould say she was untouched by war.\n\nAs he gazed at the clear calm face and the dress that seemed neat\nthough old and, like all things, so faraway, his mind grew clearer and\nclearer. It seemed to him certain it was the face of his mother, but\nfrom thirty years ago, out of old memories and one picture. He felt\nsure it was his mother as she had been when he was very small. And yet\nafter thirty years how could he know? He puzzled to try and be quite\nsure. But how she came to be there, looking like that, out of those\noldest memories, he did not think of at all.\n\nHe seemed to be hugely tired by many things and did not want to think.\nYet he was very happy, more happy even than tired men just come home\nall new to comfort.\n\nHe gazed and gazed at the face in the dark. And then he felt quite\nsure.\n\nHe was about to speak. Was she looking at him? Was she watching him,\nhe wondered. He glanced for the first time to his own reflection in\nthat clear row of faces.\n\nHis own reflection was not there, but blank dark showed between his\ntwo neighbours. And then he knew he was dead.\n\n\n\n\nOld England\n\n\nTowards winter's end on a high, big, bare down, in the south of\nEngland, John Plowman was plowing. He was plowing the brown field at\nthe top of the hill, good soil of the clay; a few yards lower down was\nnothing but chalk, with shallow flinty soil and steep to plow; so they\nlet briars grow there. For generations his forbears had plowed on the\ntop of that hill. John did not know how many. The hills were very old;\nit might have been always.\n\nHe scarcely looked to see if his furrow was going straight. The work\nhe was doing was so much in his blood that he could almost feel if\nfurrows were straight or not. Year after year they moved on the same\nold landmarks; thorn trees and briars mostly guided the plow, where\nthey stood on the untamed land beyond; the thorn trees grew old at\ntheir guiding, and still the furrows varied not by the breadth of a\nhoof-mark.\n\nJohn, as he plowed, had leisure to meditate on much besides the crops;\nhe knew so much of the crops that his thoughts could easily run free\nfrom them; he used to meditate on who they were that lived in briar\nand thorn tree, and danced as folk said all through midsummer night,\nand sometimes blessed and sometimes harmed the crops; for he knew that\nin Old England were wonderful ancient things, odder and older things\nthan many folks knew. And his eyes had leisure to see much beside the\nfurrows, for he could almost feel the furrows going straight.\n\nOne day at his plowing, as he watched the thorn ahead, he saw the\nwhole big hill besides, looking south, and the lands below it; one day\nhe saw in the bright sun of late winter a horseman riding the road\nthrough the wide lands below. The horseman shone as he rode, and wore\nwhite linen over what was shining, and on the linen was a big red\ncross. \"One of them knights,\" John Plowman said to himself or his\nhorse, \"going to them crusades.\" And he went on with his plowing all\nthat day satisfied, and remembered what he had seen for years, and\ntold his son.\n\nFor there is in England, and there always was, mixed with the needful\nthings that feed or shelter the race, the wanderer-feeling for\nromantic causes that runs deep and strange through the other thoughts,\nas the Gulf Stream runs through the sea. Sometimes generations of John\nPlowman's family would go by and no high romantic cause would come to\nsate that feeling. They would work on just the same though a little\nsombrely, as though some good thing had been grudged them. And then\nthe Crusades had come, and John Plowman had seen the Red Cross knight\ngo by, riding towards the sea in the morning, and Jon Plowman was\nsatisfied.\n\nSome generations later a man of the same name was plowing the same\nhill. They still plowed the brown clay at the top and left the slope\nwild, though there were many changes. And the furrows were wonderfully\nstraight still. And half he watched a thorn tree ahead as he plowed\nand half he took in the whole hill sloping south and the wide lands\nbelow it, far beyond which was the sea. They had a railway now down in\nthe valley. The sunlight glittering near the end of winter shone on a\ntrain that was marked with great white squares and red crosses on\nthem.\n\nJohn Plowman stopped his horses and looked at the train. \"An\nambulance train,\" he said, \"coming up from the coast.\" He thought\nof the lads he knew and wondered if any were there. He pitied the men\nin that train and envied them. And then there came to him the thought\nof England's cause and of how those men had upheld it, at sea and in\ncrumbling cities. He thought of the battle whose echoes reached\nsometimes to that field, whispering to furrows and thorn trees that\nhad never heard them before. He thought of the accursed tyrant's cruel\nmight, and of the lads that had faced it. He saw the romantic\nsplendour of England's cause. He was old but had seen the glamour for\nwhich each generation looked. Satisfied in his heart and cheered with\na new content he went on with his age-old task in the business of man\nwith the hills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tales of War, by Lord Dunsany\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TALES OF WAR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5713-8.txt or 5713-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/7/1/5713/\n\nProduced by William McClain\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
