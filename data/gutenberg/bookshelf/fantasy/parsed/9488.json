For fifteen years\nor more the man wrote and wrote--good stuff, sound stuff, extremely\noriginal stuff, often superbly fine stuff--and yet no one in the whole of\nthis vast and incomparable Republic arose to his merit--no one, that is,\nsave a few encapsulated enthusiasts, chiefly somewhat dubious. It would\nbe difficult to imagine a first-rate artist cloaked in greater obscurity,\neven in the remotest lands of Ghengis Khan. The newspapers, reviewing\nhim, dismissed him with a sort of inspired ill-nature; the critics of a\nmore austere kidney--the Paul Elmer Mores, Brander Matthewses, Hamilton\nWright Mabies, and other such brummagem dons--were utterly unaware of\nhim. Then, of a sudden, the imbeciles who operate the Comstock Society\nraided and suppressed his \"Jurgen,\" and at once he was a made man. Old\nbook-shops began to be ransacked for his romances and extravaganzas--many\nof them stored, I daresay, as \"picture-books,\" and under the name of the\nartist who illustrated them, Howard Pyle. And simultaneously, a great\ngabble about him set up in the newspapers, and then in the literary\nweeklies, and finally even in the learned reviews. An Englishman, Hugh\nWalpole, magnified the excitement with some startling _hochs_; a single\n_hoch_ from the Motherland brings down the professors like firemen\nsliding down a pole. To-day every literate American has heard of Cabell,\nincluding even those presidents of women's clubs who lately confessed\nthat they had never heard of Lizette Woodworth Reese. More of his books\nare sold in a week than used to be sold in a year. Every flapper in the\nland has read \"Jurgen\" behind the door; two-thirds of the grandmothers\neast of the Mississippi have tried to borrow it from me. Solemn _Privat\nDozenten_ lecture upon the author; he is invited to take to the\nchautauqua himself; if the donkeys who manage the National Institute of\nArts and Letters were not afraid of his reply he would be offered its\ngilt-edged ribbon, vice Sylvanus Cobb, deceased. And all because a few\npornographic old fellows thrust their ever-hopeful snouts into the man's\ntenth (or was it eleventh or twelfth?) book!\n\nCertainly, the farce must appeal to Cabell himself--a sardonic mocker,\nnot incapable of making himself a character in his own _revues_. But I\ndoubt that he enjoys the actual pawing that he has been getting--any more\nthan he resented the neglect that he got for so long. Very lately, in the\nmidst of the carnival, he announced his own literary death and burial,\nand even preached a burlesque funeral sermon upon his life and times.\nSuch an artist, by the very nature of his endeavors, must needs stand\nabove all public-clapper-clawing, pro or con. He writes, not to please\nhis customers in general, nor even to please his partisans in particular,\nbut to please himself. He is his own criterion, his own audience, his own\njudge and hangman. When he does bad work, he suffers for it as no holy\nclerk ever suffered from a gnawing conscience or Freudian suppressions;\nwhen he does good work he gets his pay in a form of joy that only artists\nknow. One could no more think of him exposing himself to the stealthy,\nuneasy admiration of a women's club--he is a man of agreeable exterior,\nwith handsome manners and an eye for this and that--than one could\nimagine him taking to the stump for some political mountebank or getting\nconverted at a camp-meeting. What moves such a man to write is the\nobscure, inner necessity that Joseph Conrad has told us of, and what\nrewards him when he has done is his own searching and accurate judgment,\nhis own pride and delight in a beautiful piece of work.\n\nAt once, I suppose, you visualize a somewhat smug fellow, loftily\ncomplacent and superior--in brief, the bogus artist of Greenwich Village,\nposturing in a pot-hat before a cellar full of visiting schoolmarms, all\ndreaming of being betrayed. If so, you see a ghost. It is the curse of\nthe true artist that his work never stands before him in all its imagined\ncompleteness--that he can never look at it without feeling an impulse to\nadd to it here or take away from it there--that the beautiful, to him, is\nnot a state of being, but an eternal becoming. Satisfaction, like the\npraise of dolts, is the compensation of the aesthetic cheese-monger--the\npopular novelist, the Broadway dramatist, the Massenet and Kipling, the\nMaeterlinck and Augustus Thomas. Cabell, in fact, is forever fussing over\nhis books, trying to make them one degree better. He rewrites almost as\npertinaciously as Joseph Conrad, Henry James, or Brahms. Compare \"Domnei\"\nin its present state to \"The Soul of Melicent,\" its first state, circa\n1913. The obvious change is the change in title, but of far more\nimportance are a multitude of little changes--a phrase made more musical,\na word moved from one place to another, some small banality tracked down\nand excised, a brilliant adjective inserted, the plan altered in small\nways, the rhythm of it made more delicate and agreeable. Here, in \"The\nLine of Love,\" there is another curious example of his high capacity for\nrevision. It is not only that the book, once standing isolated, has been\nbrought into the Cabellian canon, and so related to \"Jurgen\" and \"Figures\nof Earth\" at one end, and to the tales of latter-day Virginia at the\nother; it is that the whole texture has been worked over, and the colors\nmade more harmonious, and the inner life of the thing given a fresh\nenergy. Once a flavor of the rococo hung about it; now it breathes and\nmoves. For Cabell knows a good deal more than he knew in 1905. He is an\nartist whose work shows constant progress toward the goals he aims\nat--principally the goal of a perfect style. Content, with him, is always\nsecondary. He has ideas, and they are often of much charm and\nplausibility, but his main concern is with the manner of stating them. It\nis surely not ideas that make \"Jurgen\" stand out so saliently from the\ndreadful prairie of modern American literature; it is the magnificent\nwriting that is visible on every page of it--writing apparently simple\nand spontaneous, and yet extraordinarily cunning and painstaking. The\ncurrent notoriety of \"Jurgen\" will pass. The Comstocks will turn to new\nimbecilities, and the followers of literary parades to new marvels. But\nit will remain an author's book for many a year.\n\nBy author, of course, I mean artist--not mere artisan. It was certainly\nnot surprising to hear that Maurice Hewlett found \"Jurgen\" exasperating.\nSo, too, there is exasperation in Richard Strauss for plodding\nmusic-masters. Hewlett is simply a British Civil Servant turned author,\nwhich is not unsuggestive of an American Congressman turned philosopher.\nHe has a pretty eye for color, and all the gusto that goes with\nbeefiness, but like all the men of his class and race and time he can\nthink only within the range of a few elemental ideas, chiefly of a\nsentimental variety, and when he finds those ideas flouted he is\nhorrified. The bray, in fact, revealed the ass. It is Cabell's\nskepticism that saves him from an Americanism as crushing as Hewlett's\nBriticism, and so sets him free as an artist. Unhampered by a mission,\nhappily ignorant of what is commended by all good men, disdainful of the\npetty certainties of pedagogues and green-grocers, not caring a damn\nwhat becomes of the Republic, or the Family, or even snivelization\nitself, he is at liberty to disport himself pleasantly with his nouns,\nverbs, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns,\narranging them with the same free hand, the same innocent joy, the same\nsuperb skill and discretion with which the late Jahveh arranged carbon,\nnitrogen, sulphur, hydrogen, oxygen and phosphorus in the sublime form\nof the human carcass. He, too, has his jokes. He knows the arch effect\nof a strange touch; his elaborate pedantries correspond almost exactly\nto the hook noses, cock eyes, outstanding ears and undulating Adam's\napples which give so sinister and Rabelaisian a touch to the human\nscene. But in the main he sticks to more seemly materials and designs.\nHis achievement, in fact, consists precisely in the success with which\nhe gives those materials a striking newness, and gets a novel vitality\ninto those designs. He takes the ancient and mouldy parts of speech--the\nliver and lights of harangues by Dr. Harding, of editorials in the New\nYork _Times_, of \"Science and Health, with a Key to the Scriptures,\" of\ndepartment-store advertisements, of college yells, of chautauqual\noratory, of smoke-room anecdote--and arranges them in mosaics that\nglitter with an almost fabulous light. He knows where a red noun should\ngo, and where a peacock-blue verb, and where an adjective as darkly\npurple as a grape. He is an imagist in prose. You may like his story and\nyou may not like it, but if you don't like the way he tells it then\nthere is something the matter with your ears. As for me, his experiments\nwith words caress me as I am caressed by the tunes of old Johannes\nBrahms. How simple it seems to manage them--and how infernally difficult\nit actually is!\n\nH. L.

GRUNDY: You may have observed that nowadays we rank the\nlove-story among the comfits of literature; and we do this for the\nexcellent reason that man is a thinking animal by courtesy rather\nthan usage.\n\nRightly considered, the most trivial love-affair is of staggering import.\nWho are we to question this, when nine-tenths of us owe our existence to\na summer flirtation? And while our graver economic and social and psychic\n\"problems\" (to settle some one of which is nowadays the object of all\nponderable fiction) are doubtless worthy of most serious consideration,\nyou will find, my dear madam, that frivolous love-affairs, little and\nbig, were shaping history and playing spillikins with sceptres long\nbefore any of these delectable matters were thought of.\n\nYes, even the most talked-about \"questions of the day\" are sometimes\nworthy of consideration; but were it not for the kisses of remote years\nand the high gropings of hearts no longer animate, there would be none to\naccord them this same consideration, and a void world would teeter about\nthe sun, silent and naked as an orange. Love is an illusion, if you\nwill; but always through this illusion, alone, has the next generation\nbeen rendered possible, and all endearing human idiocies, including\n\"questions of the day,\" have been maintained.\n\nLove, then, is no trifle. And literature, mimicking life at a\nrespectful distance, may very reasonably be permitted an occasional\nreference to the corner-stone of all that exists. For in life \"a\ntrivial little love-story\" is a matter more frequently aspersed than\nfound. Viewed in the light of its consequences, any love-affair is of\ngigantic signification, inasmuch as the most trivial is a part of\nNature's unending and, some say, her only labor, toward the peopling of\nthe worlds.\n\nShe is uninventive, if you will, this Nature, but she is tireless.\nGeneration by generation she brings it about that for a period weak men\nmay stalk as demigods, while to every woman is granted at least one hour\nwherein to spurn the earth, a warm, breathing angel. Generation by\ngeneration does Nature thus betrick humanity, that humanity may endure.\n\nHere for a little--with the gracious connivance of Mr. R. E. Townsend,\nto whom all lyrics hereinafter should be accredited--I have followed\nNature, the arch-trickster. Through her monstrous tapestry I have traced\nout for you the windings of a single thread. It is parti-colored, this\nthread--now black for a mourning sign, and now scarlet where blood has\nstained it, and now brilliancy itself--for the tinsel of young love\n(if, as wise men tell us, it be but tinsel), at least makes a\nprodigiously fine appearance until time tarnish it. I entreat you, dear\nlady, to accept this traced-out thread with assurances of my most\ndistinguished regard.\n\nThe gift is not great. Hereinafter is recorded nothing more weighty than\nthe follies of young persons, perpetrated in a lost world which when\ncompared with your ladyship's present planet seems rather callow.\nHereinafter are only love-stories, and nowadays nobody takes love-making\nvery seriously....\n\nAnd truly, my dear madam, I dare say the Pompeiians did not take Vesuvius\nvery seriously; it was merely an eligible spot for a _f\u00eate champ\u00eatre_.\nAnd when gaunt fishermen first preached Christ about the highways, depend\nupon it, that was not taken very seriously, either. _Credat Judaeus_; but\nall sensible folk--such as you and I, my dear madam--passed on with a\ntolerant shrug, knowing \"their doctrine could be held of no sane man.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAPRIL 30, 1293--MAY 1, 1323\n\n\"_Pus vezem de novelh florir pratz, e vergiers reverdezir rius e fontanas\nesclarzir, ben deu quascus lo joy jauzir don es jauzens_.\"\n\n\nIt would in ordinary circumstances be my endeavor to tell you, first of\nall, just whom the following tale concerns. Yet to do this is not\nexpedient, since any such attempt could not but revive the question as to\nwhose son was Florian de Puysange?\n\nNo gain is to be had by resuscitating the mouldy scandal: and, indeed,\nit does not matter a button, nowadays, that in Poictesme, toward the end\nof the thirteenth century, there were elderly persons who considered the\nyoung Vicomte de Puysange to exhibit an indiscreet resemblance to Jurgen\nthe pawnbroker. In the wild youth of Jurgen, when Jurgen was a\npractising poet (declared these persons), Jurgen had been very intimate\nwith the former Vicomte de Puysange, now dead, for the two men had much\nin common. Oh, a great deal more in common, said these gossips, than the\npoor vicomte ever suspected, as you can see for yourself. That was the\nextent of the scandal, now happily forgotten, which we must at outset\nagree to ignore.\n\nAll this was in Poictesme, whither the young vicomte had come a-wooing\nthe oldest daughter of the Comte de la For\u00eat. The whispering and the\nnods did not much trouble Messire Jurgen, who merely observed that he\nwas used to the buffets of a censorious world; young Florian never heard\nof this furtive chatter; and certainly what people said in Poictesme did\nnot at all perturb the vicomte's mother, that elderly and pious lady,\nMadame F\u00e9lise de Puysange, at her remote home in Normandy. The\nprincipals taking the affair thus quietly, we may with profit emulate\nthem. So I let lapse this delicate matter of young Florian's paternity,\nand begin with his wedding._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_The Episode Called The Wedding Jest_\n\n\n1. _Concerning Several Compacts_\n\nIt is a tale which they narrate in Poictesme, telling how love began\nbetween Florian de Puysange and Adelaide de la For\u00eat. They tell also how\nyoung Florian had earlier fancied other women for one reason or another;\nbut that this, he knew, was the great love of his life, and a love which\nwould endure unchanged as long as his life lasted.\n\nAnd the tale tells how the Comte de la For\u00eat stroked a gray beard, and\nsaid, \"Well, after all, Puysange is a good fief--\"\n\n\"As if that mattered!\" cried his daughter, indignantly. \"My father, you\nare a deplorably sordid person.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" replied the old gentleman, \"it does matter. Fiefs last.\"\n\nSo he gave his consent to the match, and the two young people were\nmarried on Walburga's Eve, on the day that ends April.\n\nAnd they narrate how Florian de Puysange was vexed by a thought that was\nin his mind. He did not know what this thought was. But something he had\noverlooked; something there was he had meant to do, and had not done: and\na troubling consciousness of this lurked at the back of his mind like a\nsmall formless cloud. All day, while bustling about other matters, he had\ngroped toward this unapprehended thought.\n\nNow he had it: Tiburce.\n\nThe young Vicomte de Puysange stood in the doorway, looking back into the\nbright hall where they of Storisende were dancing at his marriage feast.\nHis wife, for a whole half-hour his wife, was dancing with handsome\nEtienne de N\u00e9rac. Her glance met Florian's, and Adelaide flashed him an\nespecial smile. Her hand went out as though to touch him, for all that\nthe width of the hall severed them.\n\nFlorian remembered presently to smile back at her. Then he went out of\nthe castle into a starless night that was as quiet as an unvoiced menace.\nA small and hard and gnarled-looking moon ruled over the dusk's secrecy.\nThe moon this night, afloat in a luminous gray void, somehow reminded\nFlorian of a glistening and unripe huge apple.\n\nThe foliage about him moved at most as a sleeper breathes, while Florian\ndescended eastward through walled gardens, and so came to the graveyard.\nWhite mists were rising, such mists as the witches of Amneran\nnotoriously evoked in these parts on each Walburga's Eve to purchase\nrecreations which squeamishness leaves undescribed.\n\nFor five years now Tiburce d'Arnaye had lain there. Florian thought of\nhis dead comrade and of the love which had been between them--a love more\nperfect and deeper and higher than commonly exists between men--and the\nthought came to Florian, and was petulantly thrust away, that Adelaide\nloved ignorantly where Tiburce d'Arnaye had loved with comprehension.\nYes, he had known almost the worst of Florian de Puysange, this dear lad\nwho, none the less, had flung himself between Black Torrismond's sword\nand the breast of Florian de Puysange. And it seemed to Florian unfair\nthat all should prosper with him, and Tiburce lie there imprisoned in\ndirt which shut away the color and variousness of things and the\ndrollness of things, wherein Tiburce d'Arnaye had taken such joy. And\nTiburce, it seemed to Florian--for this was a strange night--was\nstruggling futilely under all that dirt, which shut out movement, and\nclogged the mouth of Tiburce, and would not let him speak; and was\nstruggling to voice a desire which was unsatisfied and hopeless.\n\n\"O comrade dear,\" said Florian, \"you who loved merriment, there is a\nfeast afoot on this strange night, and my heart is sad that you are not\nhere to share in the feasting. Come, come, Tiburce, a right trusty\nfriend you were to me; and, living or dead, you should not fail to make\nmerry at my wedding.\"\n\nThus he spoke. White mists were rising, and it was Walburga's Eve.\n\nSo a queer thing happened, and it was that the earth upon the grave\nbegan to heave and to break in fissures, as when a mole passes through\nthe ground. And other queer things happened after that, and presently\nTiburce d'Arnaye was standing there, gray and vague in the moonlight as\nhe stood there brushing the mold from his brows, and as he stood there\nblinking bright wild eyes. And he was not greatly changed, it seemed to\nFlorian; only the brows and nose of Tiburce cast no shadows upon his\nface, nor did his moving hand cast any shadow there, either, though the\nmoon was naked overhead.\n\n\"You had forgotten the promise that was between us,\" said Tiburce; and\nhis voice had not changed much, though it was smaller.\n\n\"It is true. I had forgotten. I remember now.\" And Florian shivered a\nlittle, not with fear, but with distaste.\n\n\"A man prefers to forget these things when he marries. It is natural\nenough. But are you not afraid of me who come from yonder?\"\n\n\"Why should I be afraid of you, Tiburce, who gave your life for mine?\"\n\n\"I do not say. But we change yonder.\"\n\n\"And does love change, Tiburce? For surely love is immortal.\"\n\n\"Living or dead, love changes. I do not say love dies in us who may hope\nto gain nothing more from love. Still, lying alone in the dark clay,\nthere is nothing to do, as yet, save to think of what life was, and of\nwhat sunlight was, and of what we sang and whispered in dark places when\nwe had lips; and of how young grass and murmuring waters and the high\nstars beget fine follies even now; and to think of how merry our loved\nones still contrive to be, even now, with their new playfellows. Such\nreflections are not always conducive to philanthropy.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Florian then, \"and is there no way in which we who are\nstill alive may aid you to be happier yonder?\"\n\n\"Oh, but assuredly,\" replied Tiburce d'Arnaye, and he discoursed of\ncurious matters; and as he talked, the mists about the graveyard\nthickened. \"And so,\" Tiburce said, in concluding his tale, \"it is not\npermitted that I make merry at your wedding after the fashion of those\nwho are still in the warm flesh. But now that you recall our ancient\ncompact, it is permitted I have my peculiar share in the merriment, and I\nmay drink with you to the bride's welfare.\"\n\n\"I drink,\" said Florian, as he took the proffered cup, \"to the welfare of\nmy beloved Adelaide, whom alone of women I have really loved, and whom I\nshall love always.\"\n\n\"I perceive,\" replied the other, \"that you must still be having your\njoke.\"\n\nThen Florian drank, and after him Tiburce. And Florian said, \"But it is a\nstrange drink, Tiburce, and now that you have tasted it you are changed.\"\n\n\"You have not changed, at least,\" Tiburce answered; and for the first\ntime he smiled, a little perturbingly by reason of the change in him.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Florian, \"of how you fare yonder.\"\n\nSo Tiburce told him of yet more curious matters. Now the augmenting mists\nhad shut off all the rest of the world. Florian could see only vague\nrolling graynesses and a gray and changed Tiburce sitting there, with\nbright wild eyes, and discoursing in a small chill voice. The appearance\nof a woman came, and sat beside him on the right. She, too, was gray, as\nbecame Eve's senior: and she made a sign which Florian remembered, and it\ntroubled him.\n\nTiburce said then, \"And now, young Florian, you who were once so dear to\nme, it is to your welfare I drink.\"\n\n\"I drink to yours, Tiburce.\"\n\nTiburce drank first: and Florian, having drunk in turn, cried out, \"You\nhave changed beyond recognition!\"\n\n\"You have not changed,\" Tiburce d'Arnaye replied again. \"Now let me tell\nyou of our pastimes yonder.\"\n\nWith that he talked of exceedingly curious matters. And Florian began to\ngrow dissatisfied, for Tiburce was no longer recognizable, and Tiburce\nwhispered things uncomfortable to believe; and other eyes, as wild as\nhis, but lit with red flarings from behind, like a beast's eyes, showed\nin the mists to this side and to that side, for unhappy beings were\npassing through the mists upon secret errands which they discharged\nunwillingly. Then, too, the appearance of a gray man now sat to the left\nof that which had been Tiburce d'Arnaye, and this newcomer was marked so\nthat all might know who he was: and Florian's heart was troubled to note\nhow handsome and how admirable was that desecrated face even now.\n\n\"But I must go,\" said Florian, \"lest they miss me at Storisende, and\nAdelaide be worried.\"\n\n\"Surely it will not take long to toss off a third cup. Nay, comrade, who\nwere once so dear, let us two now drink our last toast together. Then go,\nin Sclaug's name, and celebrate your marriage. But before that let us\ndrink to the continuance of human mirth-making everywhere.\"\n\nFlorian drank first. Then Tiburce took his turn, looking at Florian as\nTiburce drank slowly. As he drank, Tiburce d'Arnaye was changed even\nmore, and the shape of him altered, and the shape of him trickled as\nthough Tiburce were builded of sliding fine white sand. So Tiburce\nd'Arnaye returned to his own place. The appearances that had sat to his\nleft and to his right were no longer there to trouble Florian with\nmemories. And Florian saw that the mists of Walburga's Eve had departed,\nand that the sun was rising, and that the graveyard was all overgrown\nwith nettles and tall grass.\n\nHe had not remembered the place being thus, and it seemed to him the\nnight had passed with unnatural quickness. But he thought more of the\nfact that he had been beguiled into spending his wedding-night in a\ngraveyard, in such questionable company, and of what explanation he could\nmake to Adelaide.\n\n\n2. _Of Young Persons in May_\n\nThe tale tells how Florian de Puysange came in the dawn through flowering\ngardens, and heard young people from afar, already about their maying.\nTwo by two he saw them from afar as they went with romping and laughter\ninto the tall woods behind Storisende to fetch back the May-pole with\ndubious old rites. And as they went they sang, as was customary, that\nsong which Raimbaut de Vaqueiras made in the ancient time in honor of\nMay's ageless triumph.\n\nSang they:\n\n  \"_May shows with godlike showing\n  To-day for each that sees\n  May's magic overthrowing\n  All musty memories\n  In him whom May decrees\n  To be love's own. He saith,\n  'I wear love's liveries\n  Until released by death_.'\n\n  \"_Thus all we laud May's sowing,\n  Nor heed how harvests please\n  When nowhere grain worth growing\n  Greets autumn's questing breeze,\n  And garnerers garner these--\n  Vain words and wasted breath\n  And spilth and tasteless lees--\n  Until released by death._\n\n  \"_Unwillingly foreknowing\n  That love with May-time flees,\n  We take this day's bestowing,\n  And feed on fantasies\n  Such as love lends for ease\n  Where none but travaileth,\n  With lean infrequent fees,\n  Until released by death_.\"\n\nAnd Florian shook his sleek black head. \"A very foolish and pessimistical\nold song, a superfluous song, and a song that is particularly out of\nplace in the loveliest spot in the loveliest of all possible worlds.\"\n\nYet Florian took no inventory of the gardens. There was but a happy sense\nof green and gold, with blue topping all; of twinkling, fluent, tossing\nleaves and of the gray under side of elongated, straining leaves; a sense\nof pert bird noises, and of a longer shadow than usual slanting before\nhim, and a sense of youth and well-being everywhere. Certainly it was\nnot a morning wherein pessimism might hope to flourish.\n\nInstead, it was of Adelaide that Florian thought: of the tall, impulsive,\nand yet timid, fair girl who was both shrewd and innocent, and of her\ntenderly colored loveliness, and of his abysmally unmerited felicity in\nhaving won her. Why, but what, he reflected, grimacing--what if he had\ntoo hastily married somebody else? For he had earlier fancied other women\nfor one reason or another: but this, he knew, was the great love of his\nlife, and a love which would endure unchanged as long as his life lasted.\n\n\n3. _What Comes of Marrying Happily_\n\nThe tale tells how Florian de Puysange found Adelaide in the company of\ntwo ladies who were unknown to him. One of these was very old, the other\nan imposing matron in middle life. The three were pleasantly shaded by\nyoung oak-trees; beyond was a tall hedge of clipped yew. The older women\nwere at chess, while Adelaide bent her meek golden head to some of that\nfine needlework in which the girl delighted. And beside them rippled a\nsmall sunlit stream, which babbled and gurgled with silver flashes.\nFlorian hastily noted these things as he ran laughing to his wife.\n\n\"Heart's dearest--!\" he cried. And he saw, perplexed, that Adelaide had\nrisen with a faint wordless cry, and was gazing at him as though she\nwere puzzled and alarmed a very little.\n\n\"Such an adventure as I have to tell you of!\" says Florian then.\n\n\"But, hey, young man, who are you that would seem to know my daughter so\nwell?\" demands the lady in middle life, and she rose majestically from\nher chess-game.\n\nFlorian stared, as he well might. \"Your daughter, madame! But certainly\nyou are not Dame Melicent.\"\n\nAt this the old, old woman raised her nodding head. \"Dame Melicent? And\nwas it I you were seeking, sir?\"\n\nNow Florian looked from one to the other of these incomprehensible\nstrangers, bewildered: and his eyes came back to his lovely wife, and his\nlips smiled irresolutely. \"Is this some jest to punish me, my dear?\"\n\nBut then a new and graver trouble kindled in his face, and his eyes\nnarrowed, for there was something odd about his wife also.\n\n\"I have been drinking in queer company,\" he said. \"It must be that my\nhead is not yet clear. Now certainly it seems to me that you are Adelaide\nde la For\u00eat, and certainly it seems to me that you are not Adelaide.\"\n\nThe girl replied, \"Why, no, messire; I am Sylvie de Nointel.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" says the middle-aged lady, briskly, \"let us make an end to\nthis play-acting, and, young fellow, let us have a sniff at you. No, you\nare not tipsy, after all. Well, I am glad of that. So let us get to the\nbottom of this business. What do they call you when you are at home?\"\n\n\"Florian de Puysange,\" he answered, speaking meekly enough. This capable\nlarge person was to the young man rather intimidating.\n\n\"La!\" said she. She looked at him very hard. She nodded gravely two or\nthree times, so that her double chin opened and shut. \"Yes, and you favor\nhim. How old are you?\"\n\nHe told her twenty-four.\n\nShe said, inconsequently: \"So I was a fool, after all. Well, young man,\nyou will never be as good-looking as your father, but I trust you have an\nhonester nature. However, bygones are bygones. Is the old rascal still\nliving? and was it he that had the impudence to send you to me?\"\n\n\"My father, madame, was slain at the battle of Marchfeld--\"\n\n\"Some fifty years ago! And you are twenty-four. Young man, your\nparentage had unusual features, or else we are at cross-purposes. Let us\nstart at the beginning of this. You tell us you are called Florian de\nPuysange and that you have been drinking in queer company. Now let us\nhave the whole story.\"\n\nFlorian told of last night's happenings, with no more omissions than\nseemed desirable with feminine auditors.\n\nThen the old woman said: \"I think this is a true tale, my daughter, for\nthe witches of Amneran contrive strange things, with mists to aid them,\nand with Lilith and Sclaug to abet. Yes, and this fate has fallen before\nto men that were over-friendly with the dead.\"\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" said the stout lady.\n\n\"But, no, my daughter. Thus seven persons slept at Ephesus, from the time\nof Decius to the time of Theodosius--\"\n\n\"Still, Mother--\"\n\n\"--And the proof of it is that they were called Constantine and Dionysius\nand John and Malchus and Marcian and Maximian and Serapion. They were\nduly canonized. You cannot deny that this thing happened without\nasserting no less than seven blessed saints to have been unprincipled\nliars, and that would be a very horrible heresy--\"\n\n\"Yet, Mother, you know as well as I do--\"\n\n\"--And thus Epimenides, another excellently spoken-of saint, slept at\nAthens for fifty-seven years. Thus Charlemagne slept in the Untersberg,\nand will sleep until the ravens of Miramon Lluagor have left his\nmountains. Thus Rhyming Thomas in the Eildon Hills, thus Ogier in Avalon,\nthus Oisin--\"\n\nThe old lady bade fair to go on interminably in her gentle resolute\npiping old voice, but the other interrupted.\n\n\"Well, Mother, do not excite yourself about it, for it only makes your\nasthma worse, and does no especial good to anybody. Things may be as you\nsay. Certainly I intended nothing irreligious. Yet these extended naps,\nappropriate enough for saints and emperors, are out of place in one's own\nfamily. So, if it is not stuff and nonsense, it ought to be. And that I\nstick to.\"\n\n\"But we forget the boy, my dear,\" said the old lady. \"Now listen, Florian\nde Puysange. Thirty years ago last night, to the month and the day, it\nwas that you vanished from our knowledge, leaving my daughter a forsaken\nbride. For I am what the years have made of Dame Melicent, and this is my\ndaughter Adelaide, and yonder is her daughter Sylvie de Nointel.\"\n\n\"La, Mother,\" observed the stout lady, \"but are you certain it was the\nlast of April? I had been thinking it was some time in June. And I\nprotest it could not have been all of thirty years. Let me see now,\nSylvie, how old is your brother Richard? Twenty-eight, you say. Well,\nMother, I always said you had a marvelous memory for things like that,\nand I often envy you. But how time does fly, to be sure!\"\n\nAnd Florian was perturbed. \"For this is an awkward thing, and Tiburce has\nplayed me an unworthy trick. He never did know when to leave off joking;\nbut such posthumous frivolity is past endurance. For, see now, in what a\npickle it has landed me! I have outlived my friends, I may encounter\ndifficulty in regaining my fiefs, and certainly I have lost the fairest\nwife man ever had. Oh, can it be, madame, that you are indeed my\nAdelaide!\"\n\n\"Yes, every pound of me, poor boy, and that says much.\"\n\n\"--And that you have been untrue to the eternal fidelity which you vowed\nto me here by this very stream! Oh, but I cannot believe it was thirty\nyears ago, for not a grass-blade or a pebble has been altered; and I\nperfectly remember the lapping of water under those lichened rocks, and\nthat continuous file of ripples yonder, which are shaped like\narrowheads.\"\n\nAdelaide rubbed her nose. \"Did I promise eternal fidelity? I can hardly\nremember that far back. But I remember I wept a great deal, and my\nparents assured me you were either dead or a rascal, so that tears could\nnot help either way. Then Ralph de Nointel came along, good man, and made\nme a fair husband, as husbands go--\"\n\n\"As for that stream,\" then said Dame Melicent, \"it is often I have\nthought of that stream, sitting here with my grandchildren where I once\nsat with gay young men whom nobody remembers now save me. Yes, it is\nstrange to think that instantly, and within the speaking of any simple\nword, no drop of water retains the place it had before the word was\nspoken: and yet the stream remains unchanged, and stays as it was when I\nsat here with those young men who are gone. Yes, that is a strange\nthought, and it is a sad thought, too, for those of us who are old.\"\n\n\"But, Mother, of course the stream remains unchanged,\" agreed Dame\nAdelaide. \"Streams always do except after heavy rains. Everybody knows\nthat, and I can see nothing very remarkable about it. As for you,\nFlorian, if you stickle for love's being an immortal affair,\" she added,\nwith a large twinkle, \"I would have you know I have been a widow for\nthree years. So the matter could be arranged.\"\n\nFlorian looked at her sadly. To him the situation was incongruous with\nthe terrible archness of a fat woman. \"But, madame, you are no longer the\nsame person.\"\n\nShe patted him upon the shoulder. \"Come, Florian, there is some sense in\nyou, after all. Console yourself, lad, with the reflection that if you\nhad stuck manfully by your wife instead of mooning about graveyards, I\nwould still be just as I am to-day, and you would be tied to me. Your\nfriend probably knew what he was about when he drank to our welfare, for\nwe would never have suited each other, as you can see for yourself. Well,\nMother, many things fall out queerly in this world, but with age we learn\nto accept what happens without flustering too much over it. What are we\nto do with this resurrected old lover of mine?\"\n\nIt was horrible to Florian to see how prosaically these women dealt with\nhis unusual misadventure. Here was a miracle occurring virtually before\ntheir eyes, and these women accepted it with maddening tranquillity as an\naffair for which they were not responsible. Florian began to reflect that\nelderly persons were always more or less unsympathetic and inadequate.\n\n\"First of all,\" says Dame Melicent, \"I would give him some breakfast. He\nmust be hungry after all these years. And you could put him in\nAdhelmar's room--\"\n\n\"But,\" Florian said wildly, to Dame Adelaide, \"you have committed the\ncrime of bigamy, and you are, after all, my wife!\"\n\nShe replied, herself not untroubled: \"Yes, but, Mother, both the cook and\nthe butler are somewhere in the bushes yonder, up to some nonsense that I\nprefer to know nothing about. You know how servants are, particularly on\nholidays. I could scramble him some eggs, though, with a rasher. And\nAdhelmar's room it had better be, I suppose, though I had meant to have\nit turned out. But as for bigamy and being your wife,\" she concluded more\ncheerfully, \"it seems to me the least said the soonest mended. It is to\nnobody's interest to rake up those foolish bygones, so far as I can see.\"\n\n\"Adelaide, you profane equally love, which is divine, and marriage, which\nis a holy sacrament.\"\n\n\"Florian, do you really love Adelaide de Nointel?\" asked this terrible\nwoman. \"And now that I am free to listen to your proposals, do you wish\nto marry me?\"\n\n\"Well, no,\" said Florian: \"for, as I have just said; you are no longer\nthe same person.\"\n\n\"Why, then, you see for yourself. So do you quit talking nonsense about\nimmortality and sacraments.\"\n\n\"But, still,\" cried Florian, \"love is immortal. Yes, I repeat to you,\nprecisely as I told Tiburce, love is immortal.\"\n\nThen says Dame Melicent, nodding her shriveled old head: \"When I was\nyoung, and was served by nimbler senses and desires, and was housed in\nbrightly colored flesh, there were a host of men to love me. Minstrels\nyet tell of the men that loved me, and of how many tall men were slain\nbecause of their love for me, and of how in the end it was Perion who won\nme. For the noblest and the most faithful of all my lovers was Perion of\nthe Forest, and through tempestuous years he sought me with a love that\nconquered time and chance: and so he won me. Thereafter he made me a fair\nhusband, as husbands go. But I might not stay the girl he had loved, nor\nmight he remain the lad that Melicent had dreamed of, with dreams\nbe-drugging the long years in which Demetrios held Melicent a prisoner,\nand youth went away from her. No, Perion and I could not do that, any\nmore than might two drops of water there retain their place in the\nstream's flowing. So Perion and I grew old together, friendly enough;\nand our senses and desires began to serve us more drowsily, so that we\ndid not greatly mind the falling away of youth, nor greatly mind to note\nwhat shriveled hands now moved before us, performing common tasks; and we\nwere content enough. But of the high passion that had wedded us there was\nno trace, and of little senseless human bickerings there were a great\nmany. For one thing\"--and the old lady's voice was changed--\"for one\nthing, he was foolishly particular about what he would eat and what he\nwould not eat, and that upset my housekeeping, and I had never any\npatience with such nonsense.\"\n\n\"Well, none the less,\" said Florian, \"it is not quite nice of you to\nacknowledge it.\"\n\nThen said Dame Adelaide: \"That is a true word, Mother. All men get\nfinicky about their food, and think they are the only persons to be\nconsidered, and there is no end to it if once you begin to humor them. So\nthere has to be a stand made. Well, and indeed my poor Ralph, too, was\nall for kissing and pretty talk at first, and I accepted it willingly\nenough. You know how girls are. They like to be made much of, and it is\nperfectly natural. But that leads to children. And when the children\nbegan to come, I had not much time to bother with him: and Ralph had his\nfarming and his warfaring to keep him busy. A man with a growing family\ncannot afford to neglect his affairs. And certainly, being no fool, he\nbegan to notice that girls here and there had brighter eyes and trimmer\nwaists than I. I do not know what such observations may have led to when\nhe was away from me: I never inquired into it, because in such matters\nall men are fools. But I put up with no nonsense at home, and he made me\na fair husband, as husbands go. That much I will say for him gladly: and\nif any widow says more than that, Florian, do you beware of her, for she\nis an untruthful woman.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may,\" replied Florian, \"it is not quite becoming to speak\nthus of your dead husband. No doubt you speak the truth: there is no\ntelling what sort of person you may have married in what still seems to\nme unseemly haste to provide me with a successor: but even so, a little\ncharitable prevarication would be far more edifying.\"\n\nHe spoke with such earnestness that there fell a silence. The women\nseemed to pity him. And in the silence Florian heard from afar young\npersons returning from the woods behind Storisende, and bringing with\nthem the May-pole. They were still singing.\n\nSang they:\n\n  \"_Unwillingly foreknowing\n  That love with May-time flees,\n  We take this day's bestowing,\n  And feed on fantasies_--\"\n\n\n4. _Youth Solves It_\n\nThe tale tells how lightly and sweetly, and compassionately, too, then\nspoke young Sylvie de Nointel.\n\n\"Ah, but, assuredly, Messire Florian, you do not argue with my pets\nquite seriously! Old people always have some such queer notions. Of\ncourse love all depends upon what sort of person you are. Now, as I see\nit, Mama and Grandmama are not the sort of persons who have real\nlove-affairs. Devoted as I am to both of them, I cannot but perceive they\nare lacking in real depth of sentiment. They simply do not understand or\ncare about such matters. They are fine, straightforward, practical\npersons, poor dears, and always have been, of course, for in things like\nthat one does not change, as I have often noticed. And Father, and\nGrandfather Perion, too, as I remember him, was kind-hearted and\nadmirable and all that, but nobody could ever have expected him to be a\nsatisfactory lover. Why, he was bald as an egg, the poor pet!\"\n\nAnd Sylvie laughed again at the preposterous notions of old people. She\nflashed an especial smile at Florian. Her hand went out as though to\ntouch him, in an unforgotten gesture. \"Old people do not understand,\"\nsaid Sylvie de Nointel, in tones which took this handsome young fellow\nineffably into confidence.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Florian, with a sigh that was part relief and all\napproval, \"it is you who speak the truth, and your elders have fallen\nvictims to the cynicism of a crassly material age. Love is immortal when\nit is really love and when one is the right sort of person. There is the\nlove--known to how few, alas! and a passion of which I regret to find\nyour mother incapable--that endures unchanged until the end of life.\"\n\n\"I am so glad you think so, Messire Florian,\" she answered demurely.\n\n\"And do you not think so, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"How should I know,\" she asked him, \"as yet?\" He noted she had incredibly\nlong lashes.\n\n\"Thrice happy is he that convinces you!\" says Florian. And about them,\nwho were young in the world's recaptured youth, spring triumphed with an\nageless rural pageant, and birds cried to their mates. He noted the red\nbrevity of her lips and their probable softness.\n\nMeanwhile the elder women regarded each other.\n\n\"It is the season of May. They are young and they are together. Poor\nchildren!\" said Dame Melicent. \"Youth cries to youth for the toys of\nyouth, and saying, 'Lo, I cry with the voice of a great god!'\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Madame Adelaide, \"Puysange is a good fief--\"\n\nBut Florian heeded neither of them as he stood there by the sunlit\nstream, in which no drop of water retained its place for a moment, and\nwhich yet did not alter in appearance at all. He did not heed his elders\nfor the excellent reason that Sylvie de Nointel was about to speak, and\nhe preferred to listen to her. For this girl, he knew, was lovelier than\nany other person had ever been since Eve first raised just such admiring,\ninnocent, and venturesome eyes to inspect what must have seemed to her\nthe quaintest of all animals, called man. So it was with a shrug that\nFlorian remembered how he had earlier fancied other women for one reason\nor another; since this, he knew, was the great love of his life, and a\nlove which would endure unchanged as long as his life lasted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAPRIL 14, 1355--OCTOBER 23, 1356\n\n\"_D'aquest segle flac, plen de marrimen,\nS'amor s'en vai, son jot teinh mensongier_.\"\n\n\n_So Florian married Sylvie, and made her, they relate, a fair husband,\nas husbands go. And children came to them, and then old age, and, lastly,\nthat which comes to all._\n\nWhich reminds me that it was an uncomfortable number of years ago, in an\nout-of-the-way corner of the library at Allonby Shaw, that I first came\nupon_ Les Aventures d'Adhelmar de Nointel. _This manuscript dates from\nthe early part of the fifteenth century and is attributed--though on no\nvery conclusive evidence, says Hinsauf,--to the facile pen of Nicolas de\nCaen (circa 1450), until lately better known as a lyric poet and\nsatirist._\n\n_The story, told in decasyllabic couplets, interspersed after a rather\nunusual fashion with innumerable lyrics, seems in the main authentic. Sir\nAdhelmar de Nointel, born about 1332, was once a real and stalwart\npersonage, a younger brother to that Henri de Nointel, the fighting\nBishop of Mantes, whose unsavory part in the murder of Jacques van\nArteveldt history has recorded at length; and it is with the exploits of\nthis Adhelmar that the romance deals, not, it may be, without\nexaggeration._\n\n_In any event, the following is, with certain compressions and omissions\nthat have seemed desirable, the last episode of the_ Aventures. _The tale\nconcerns the children of Florian and Sylvie: and for it I may claim, at\nleast, the same merit that old Nicolas does at the very outset; since as\nhe veraciously declares--yet with a smack of pride:_\n\n  _Cette bonne ystoire n'est pas us\u00e9e,\n  Ni gu\u00e8re de lieux jadis trouv\u00e9e,\n  Ni \u00e8crite par clercz ne fut encore._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Episode Called Adhelmar at Puysange_\n\n\nI. _April-magic_\n\nWhen Adhelmar had ended the tale of Dame Venus and the love which she\nbore the knight Tannh\u00e4user (here one overtakes Nicolas midcourse in\nnarrative), Adhelmar put away the book and sighed. The Demoiselle M\u00e9lite\nlaughed a little--her laughter, as I have told you, was high and\ndelicate, with the resonance of thin glass--and demanded the reason of\nhis sudden grief.\n\n\"I sigh,\" he answered, \"for sorrow that this Dame Venus is dead.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said she, wondering at his glum face, \"that is no great\nmatter.\"\n\n\"By Saint Vulfran, yes!\" Adhelmar protested; \"for the same Lady Venus was\nthe fairest of women, as all learned clerks avow; and she is dead these\nmany years, and now there is no woman left alive so beautiful as\nshe--saving one alone, and she will have none of me. And therefore,\" he\nadded, very slowly, \"I sigh for desire of Dame Venus and for envy of the\nknight Tannh\u00e4user.\"\n\nAgain M\u00e9lite laughed, but she forbore--discreetly enough--to question him\nconcerning the lady who was of equal beauty with Dame Venus.\n\nIt was an April morning, and they set in the hedged garden of Puysange.\nAdhelmar read to her of divers ancient queens and of the love-business\nwherein each took part, relating the histories of the Lady Heleine and of\nher sweethearting with Duke Paris, the Emperor of Troy's son, and of the\nLady Melior that loved Parth\u00e9nopex of Blois, and of the Lady Aude, for\nlove of whom Sieur Roland slew the pagan Angoulaffre, and of the Lady\nCresseide that betrayed love, and of the Lady Morgaine la F\u00e9e, whose\nDanish lover should yet come from Avalon to save France in her black hour\nof need. All these he read aloud, suavely, with bland modulations, for he\nwas a man of letters, as letters went in those days. Originally, he had\nbeen bred for the Church; but this vocation he had happily forsaken long\nsince, protesting with some show of reason that France at this particular\ntime had a greater need of spears than of aves.\n\nFor the rest, Sir Adhelmar de Nointel was known as a valiant knight, who\nhad won glory in the wars with the English. He had lodged for a fortnight\nat Puysange, of which castle the master, Sire Reinault (son to the late\nVicomte Florian) was Adhelmar's cousin: and on the next day Adhelmar\nproposed to set forth for Paris, where the French King--Jehan the\nLuckless--was gathering his lieges about him to withstand his kinsman,\nEdward of England.\n\nNow, as I have said, Adhelmar was cousin to Reinault, and, in\nconsequence, to Reinault's sister, the Demoiselle M\u00e9lite; and the latter\nAdhelmar loved, at least, as much as a cousin should. That was well\nknown; and Reinault de Puysange had sworn very heartily that this was a\ngreat pity when he affianced her to Hugues d'Arques. Both Hugues and\nAdhelmar had loved M\u00e9lite since boyhood,--so far their claims ran\nequally. But while Adhelmar had busied himself in the acquisition of some\nscant fame and a vast number of scars, Hugues had sensibly inherited the\nfief of Arques, a snug property with fertile lands and a stout fortress.\nHow, then, should Reinault hesitate between them?\n\nHe did not. For the Ch\u00e2teau d'Arques, you must understand, was builded in\nLower Normandy, on the fringe of the hill-country, just where the\npeninsula of Cotentin juts out into the sea; Puysange stood not far\nnorth, among the level lands of Upper Normandy: and these two being the\nstrongest castles in those parts, what more natural and desirable than\nthat the families should be united by marriage? Reinault informed his\nsister of his decision; she wept a little, but did not refuse to comply.\n\nSo Adhelmar, come again to Puysange after five years' absence, found\nM\u00e9lite troth-plighted, fast and safe, to Hugues. Reinault told him.\nAdhelmar grumbled and bit his nails in a corner, for a time; then\nlaughed shortly.\n\n\"I have loved M\u00e9lite,\" he said. \"It may be that I love her still. Hah,\nSaint Vulfran! why should I not? Why should a man not love his cousin?\"\n\nAdhelmar grinned, while the vicomte twitched his beard and wished\nAdhelmar at the devil.\n\nBut the young knight stuck fast at Puysange, for all that, and he and\nM\u00e9lite were much together. Daily they made parties to dance, and to hunt\nthe deer, and to fish, but most often to rehearse songs. For Adhelmar\nmade good songs.\n\n[Footnote: Nicolas indeed declares of Adhelmar, earlier in the tale, in\nsuch high terms as are not uncommon to this chronicle:\n\n  Hardi estait et fier comme lions,\n  Et si faisait balades et chan\u00e7ons,\n  Rondeaulx et laiz, tr\u00e8s bans et pleins de gr\u00e2ce,\n  Comme Orpheus, cet menestrier de Thrace.]\n\nTo-day, the summer already stirring in the womb of the year, they sat, as\nI have said, in the hedged garden; and about them the birds piped and\nwrangled over their nest-building, and daffodils danced in spring's honor\nwith lively saltations, and overhead the sky was colored like a robin's\negg. It was very perilous weather for young folk. By reason of this, when\nhe had ended his reading about the lady of the hollow hill, Sir Adhelmar\nsighed again, and stared at his companion with hungry eyes, wherein\ndesire strained like a hound at the leash.\n\nSaid M\u00e9lite, \"Was this Lady Venus, then, exceedingly beautiful?\"\n\nAdhelmar swore an oath of sufficient magnitude that she was.\n\nWhereupon M\u00e9lite, twisting her fingers idly and evincing a sudden\ninterest in her own feet, demanded if this Venus were more beautiful than\nthe Lady Ermengarde of Arnaye or the Lady Ysabeau of Brieuc.\n\n\"Holy Ouen!\" scoffed Adhelmar; \"these ladies, while well enough, I grant\nyou, would seem to be callow howlets blinking about that Arabian Phoenix\nwhich Plinius tells of, in comparison with this Lady Venus that is dead!\"\n\n\"But how,\" asked M\u00e9lite, \"was this lady fashioned that you commend so\nhighly?--and how can you know of her beauty who have never seen her?\"\n\nSaid Adhelmar: \"I have read of her fairness in the chronicles of Messire\nStace of Thebes, and of Dares, who was her husband's bishop. And she was\nvery comely, neither too little nor too big; she was fairer and whiter\nand more lovely than any flower of the lily or snow upon the branch, but\nher eyebrows had the mischance of meeting. She had wide-open, beautiful\neyes, and her wit was quick and ready. She was graceful and of demure\ncountenance. She was well-beloved, and could herself love well, but her\nheart was changeable--\"\n\n\"Cousin Adhelmar,\" declared M\u00e9lite, flushing somewhat, for the portrait\nwas like enough, \"I think that you tell of a woman, not of a goddess of\nheathenry.\"\n\n\"Her eyes,\" said Adhelmar, and his voice shook, and his hands, lifting a\nlittle, trembled,--\"her eyes were large and very bright and of a color\nlike that of the June sunlight falling upon deep waters. Her hair\nwas of a curious gold color like the Fleece that the knight Jason sought,\nand it curled marvellously about her temples. For mouth she had but a\nsmall red wound; and her throat was a tower builded of ivory.\"\n\nBut now, still staring at her feet and glowing with the even complexion\nof a rose, (though not ill-pleased), the Demoiselle M\u00e9lite bade him\ndesist and make her a song. Moreover, she added, beauty was but a\nfleeting thing, and she considered it of little importance; and then she\nlaughed again.\n\nAdhelmar took up the lute that lay beside them and fingered it for a\nmoment, as though wondering of what he would rhyme. Afterward he sang for\nher as they sat in the gardens.\n\nSang Adhelmar:\n\n  _\"It is in vain I mirror forth the praise\n  In pondered virelais\n  Of her that is the lady of my love;\n  Far-sought and curious phrases fail to tell\n  The tender miracle\n  Of her white body and the grace thereof.\n\n  \"Thus many and many an artful-artless strain\n  Is fashioned all in vain:\n  Sound proves unsound; and even her name, that is\n  To me more glorious than the glow of fire\n  Or dawn or love's desire\n  Or opals interlinked with turquoises,\n  Mocks utterance.\n\n  \"So, lacking skill to praise\n  That perfect bodily beauty which is hers,\n  Even as those worshippers\n  Who bore rude offerings of honey and maize,\n  Their all, into the gold-paved ministers\n  Of Aphrodite, I have given her these\n  My faltering melodies,\n  That are Love's lean and ragged messengers.\"_\n\nWhen he had ended, Adhelmar cast aside the lute, and caught up both of\nM\u00e9lite's hands, and strained them to his lips. There needed no wizard to\nread the message in his eyes.\n\nM\u00e9lite sat silent for a moment. Presently, \"Ah, cousin, cousin!\" she\nsighed, \"I cannot love you as you would have me love. God alone knows\nwhy, true heart, for I revere you as a strong man and a proven knight and\na faithful lover; but I do not love you. There are many women who would\nlove you, Adhelmar, for the world praises you, and you have done brave\ndeeds and made good songs and have served your King potently; and\nyet\"--she drew her hands away and laughed a little wearily--\"yet I, poor\nmaid, must needs love Hugues, who has done nothing. This love is a\nstrange, unreasoning thing, my cousin.\"\n\n\"But do you in truth love Hugues?\" asked Adhelmar, in a harsh voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" said M\u00e9lite, very softly, and afterward flushed and wondered\ndimly if she had spoken the truth. Then, somehow, her arms clasped about\nAdhelmar's neck, and she kissed him, from pure pity, as she told\nherself; for M\u00e9lite's heart was tender, and she could not endure the\nanguish in his face.\n\nThis was all very well. But Hugues d'Arques, coming suddenly out of a\npleached walk, at this juncture, stumbled upon them and found their\npostures distasteful. He bent black brows upon the two.\n\n\"Adhelmar,\" said he, at length, \"this world is a small place.\"\n\nAdhelmar rose. \"Indeed,\" he assented, with a wried smile, \"I think there\nis scarce room in it for both of us, Hugues.\"\n\n\"That was my meaning,\" said the Sieur d'Arques.\n\n\"Only,\" Adhelmar pursued, somewhat wistfully, \"my sword just now, Hugues,\nis vowed to my King's quarrel. There are some of us who hope to save\nFrance yet, if our blood may avail. In a year, God willing, I shall come\nagain to Puysange; and till then you must wait.\"\n\nHugues conceded that, perforce, he must wait, since a vow was sacred;\nand Adhelmar, who suspected Hugues' natural appetite for battle to be\nlamentably squeamish, grinned. After that, in a sick rage, Adhelmar\nstruck Hugues in the face, and turned about.\n\nThe Sieur d'Arques rubbed his cheek ruefully. Then he and M\u00e9lite stood\nsilent for a moment, and heard Adhelmar in the court-yard calling his men\nto ride forth; and M\u00e9lite laughed; and Hugues scowled.\n\n\n2. _Nicolas as Chorus_\n\nThe year passed, and Adhelmar did not return; and there was much fighting\nduring that interval, and Hugues began to think the knight was slain and\nwould never return to fight with him. The reflection was borne with\nequanimity.\n\nSo Adhelmar was half-forgot, and the Sieur d'Arques turned his mind to\nother matters. He was still a bachelor, for Reinault considered the\nburden of the times in ill-accord with the chinking of marriage-bells.\nThey were grim times for Frenchmen: right and left the English pillaged\nand killed and sacked and guzzled and drank, as if they would never have\ndone; and Edward of England began, to subscribe himself _Rex Franciae_\nwith some show of excuse.\n\nIn Normandy men acted according to their natures. Reinault swore lustily\nand looked to his defences; Hugues, seeing the English everywhere\ntriumphant, drew a long face and doubted, when the will of God was made\nthus apparent, were it the part of a Christian to withstand it? Then he\nbegan to write letters, but to whom no man at either Arques or Puysange\nknew, saving One-eyed Peire, who carried them.\n\n\n3. _Treats of Huckstering_\n\nIt was in the dusk of a rain-sodden October day that Adhelmar rode to the\ngates of Puysange, with some score men-at-arms behind him. They came from\nPoictiers, where again the English had conquered, and Adhelmar rode with\ndifficulty, for in that disastrous business in the field of Maupertuis he\nhad been run through the chest, and his wound was scarce healed.\nNevertheless, he came to finish his debate with the Sieur d'Arques, wound\nor no wound.\n\nBut at Puysange he heard a strange tale of Hugues. Reinault, whom\nAdhelmar found in a fine rage, told the story as they sat over\ntheir supper.\n\nIt had happened, somehow, (Reinault said), that the Marshal Arnold\nd'Andreghen--newly escaped from prison and with his disposition\nunameliorated by Lord Audley's gaolership,--had heard of these letters\nthat Hugues wrote so constantly; and the Marshal, being no scholar, had\nfrowned at such doings, and waited presently, with a company of horse, on\nthe road to Arques. Into their midst, on the day before Adhelmar came,\nrode Peire, the one-eyed messenger; and it was not an unconscionable\nwhile before Peire was bound hand and foot, and d'Andreghen was reading\nthe letter they had found in Peire's jerkin. \"Hang the carrier on that\noak,\" said d'Andreghen, when he had ended, \"but leave that largest branch\nyonder for the writer. For by the Blood of Christ, our common salvation!\nI will hang him there on Monday!\"\n\nSo Peire swung in the air ere long and stuck out a black tongue at the\ncrows, who cawed and waited for supper; and presently they feasted while\nd'Andreghen rode to Arques, carrying a rope for Hugues.\n\nFor the Marshal, you must understand, was a man of sudden action. Only\ntwo months ago, he had taken the Comte de Harcourt with other gentlemen\nfrom the Dauphin's own table to behead them that afternoon in a field\nbehind Rouen. It was true they had planned to resist the _gabelle_, the\nKing's immemorial right to impose a tax on salt; but Harcourt was Hugues'\ncousin, and the Sieur d'Arques, being somewhat of an epicurean\ndisposition, esteemed the dessert accorded his kinsman unpalatable.\n\nThere was no cause for great surprise to d'Andreghen, then, to find that\nthe letter Hugues had written was meant for Edward, the Black Prince of\nEngland, now at Bordeaux, where he held the French King, whom the Prince\nhad captured at Poictiers, as a prisoner; for this prince, though he had\nno particular love for a rogue, yet knew how to make use of one when\nkingcraft demanded it,--and, as he afterward made use of Pedro the\nCastilian, he was now prepared to make use of Hugues, who hung like a\nripe pear ready to drop into Prince Edward's mouth. \"For,\" as the Sieur\nd'Arques pointed out in his letter, \"I am by nature inclined to favor you\nbrave English, and so, beyond doubt, is the good God. And I will deliver\nArques to you; and thus and thus you may take Normandy and the major\nportion of France; and thus and thus will I do, and thus and thus must\nyou reward me.\"\n\nSaid d'Andreghen, \"I will hang him at dawn; and thus and thus may the\ndevil do with his soul!\"\n\nThen with his company d'Andreghen rode to Arques. A herald declared to\nthe men of that place how the matter stood, and bade Hugues come forth\nand dance upon nothing. The Sieur d'Arques spat curses, like a cat driven\ninto a corner, and wished to fight, but the greater part of his garrison\nwere not willing to do so in such a cause: and so d'Andreghen took him\nand carried him off.\n\nIn anger having sworn by the Blood of Christ to hang Hugues d'Arques to a\ncertain tree, d'Andreghen had no choice in calm but to abide by his oath.\nThis day being the Sabbath, he deferred the matter; but the Marshal\npromised to see to it that when morning broke the Sieur d'Arques should\ndangle side by side with his messenger.\n\nThus far the Vicomte de Puysange. He concluded his narrative with a dry\nchuckle. \"And I think we are very well rid of him, Adhelmar. Holy Maclou!\nthat I should have taken the traitor for a true man, though! He would\nsell France, you observe,--chaffered, they tell me, like a pedlar over\nthe price of Normandy. Heh, the huckster, the triple-damned Jew!\"\n\n\"And M\u00e9lite?\" asked Adhelmar, after a little.\n\nAgain Reinault shrugged. \"In the White Turret,\" he said; then, with a\nshort laugh: \"Oy Dieus, yes! The girl has been caterwauling for this\nshabby rogue all day. She would have me--me, the King's man, look\nyou!--save Hugues at the peril of my seignory! And I protest to you, by\nthe most high and pious Saint Nicolas the Confessor,\" Reinault swore,\n\"that sooner than see this huckster go unpunished, I would lock Hell's\ngate on him with my own hands!\"\n\nFor a moment Adhelmar stood with his jaws puffed out, as if in thought,\nand then he laughed like a wolf. Afterward he went to the White Turret,\nleaving Reinault smiling over his wine.\n\n\n4. _Folly Diversely Attested_\n\nHe found M\u00e9lite alone. She had robed herself in black, and had gathered\nher gold hair about her face like a heavy veil, and sat weeping into it\nfor the plight of Hugues d'Arques.\n\n\"M\u00e9lite!\" cried Adhelmar; \"M\u00e9lite!\" The Demoiselle de Puysange rose with\na start, and, seeing him standing in the doorway, ran to him, incompetent\nlittle hands fluttering before her like frightened doves. She was very\ntired, by that day-long arguing with her brother's notions about honor\nand knightly faith and such foolish matters, and to her weariness\nAdhelmar seemed strength incarnate; surely he, if any one, could aid\nHugues and bring him safe out of the grim marshal's claws. For the\nmoment, perhaps, she had forgotten the feud which existed between\nAdhelmar and the Sieur d'Arques; but in any event, I am convinced, she\nknew that Adhelmar could refuse her nothing. So she ran toward him, her\ncheeks flushing arbutus-like, and she was smiling through her tears.\n\nOh, thought Adhelmar, were it not very easy to leave Hugues to the dog's\ndeath he merits and to take this woman for my own? For I know that she\nloves me a little. And thinking of this, he kissed her, quietly, as one\nmight comfort a sobbing child; afterward he held her in his arms for a\nmoment, wondering vaguely at the pliant thickness of her hair and the\nsweet scent of it. Then he put her from him gently, and swore in his soul\nthat Hugues must die, so that this woman might be Adhelmar's.\n\n\"You will save him?\" M\u00e9lite asked, and raised her face to his. There was\nthat in her eyes which caused Adhelmar to muse for a little on the nature\nof women's love, and, subsequently, to laugh harshly and make vehement\nutterance.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Adhelmar.\n\nHe demanded how many of Hugues' men were about. Some twenty of them had\ncome to Puysange, M\u00e9lite said, in the hope that Reinault might aid them\nto save their master. She protested that her brother was a coward for not\ndoing so; but Adhelmar, having his own opinion on this subject, and\nthinking in his heart that Hugues' skin might easily be ripped off him\nwithout spilling a pint of honest blood, said, simply: \"Twenty and twenty\nis two-score. It is not a large armament, but it may serve.\"\n\nHe told her his plan was to fall suddenly upon d'Andreghen and his men\nthat night, and in the tumult to steal Hugues away; whereafter, as\nAdhelmar pointed out, Hugues might readily take ship for England, and\nleave the marshal to blaspheme Fortune in Normandy, and the French King\nto gnaw at his chains in Bordeaux, while Hugues toasts his shins in\ncomfort at London. Adhelmar admitted that the plan was a mad one, but\nadded, reasonably enough, that needs must when the devil drives. And so\nfirm was his confidence, so cheery his laugh--he managed to laugh\nsomehow, though it was a stiff piece of work,--that M\u00e9lite began to be\ncomforted somewhat, and bade him go and Godspeed.\n\nSo then Adhelmar left her. In the main hall he found the vicomte still\nsitting over his wine of Anjou.\n\n\"Cousin,\" said Adhelmar, \"I must ride hence to-night.\"\n\nReinault stared at him: a mastering wonder woke in Reinault's face.\n\"Ta, ta, ta!\" he clicked his tongue, very softly. Afterward he sprang\nto his feet and clutched Adhelmar by both arms. \"No, no!\" Reinault\ncried. \"No, Adhelmar, you must not try that! It is death, lad,--sure\ndeath! It means hanging, boy!\" the vicomte pleaded, for, hard man that\nhe was, he loved Adhelmar.\n\n\"That is likely enough,\" Adhelmar conceded.\n\n\"They will hang you,\"' Reinault said again: \"d'Andreghen and the Count\nDauphin of Vienna will hang you as blithely as they would Iscariot.\"\n\n\"That, too,\" said Adhelmar, \"is likely enough, if I remain in France.\"\n\n\"Oy Dieus! will you flee to England, then?\" the vicomte scoffed,\nbitterly. \"Has King Edward not sworn to hang you these eight years past?\nWas it not you, then, cousin, who took Almerigo di Pavia, that Lombard\nknave whom he made governor of Calais,--was it not you, then, who\ndelivered Edward's loved Almerigo to Geoffrey de Chargny, who had him\nbroken on the wheel? Eh, holy Maclou! but you will get hearty welcome and\na chaplain and a rope in England.\"\n\nAdhelmar admitted that this was true. \"Still,\" said he, \"I must ride\nhence to-night.\"\n\n\"For her?\" Reinault asked, and jerked his thumb upward.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Adhelmar,--\"for her.\"\n\nReinault stared in his face for a while. \"You are a fool, Adhelmar,\" said\nhe, at last, \"but you are a brave man, and you love as becomes a\nchevalier. It is a great pity that a flibbertigibbet wench with a\ntow-head should be the death of you. For my part, I am the King's vassal;\nI shall not break faith with him; but you are my guest and my kinsman.\nFor that reason I am going to bed, and I shall sleep very soundly. It is\nlikely I shall hear nothing of the night's doings,--ohim\u00e9, no! not if you\nmurder d'Andreghen in the court-yard!\" Reinault ended, and smiled,\nsomewhat sadly.\n\nAfterward he took Adhelmar's hand and said: \"Farewell, lord Adhelmar! O\ntrue knight, sturdy and bold! terrible and merciless toward your enemies,\ngentle and simple toward your friends, farewell!\"\n\nHe kissed Adhelmar on either cheek and left him. In those days men\nencountered death with very little ado.\n\nThen Adhelmar rode off in the rain with thirty-four armed followers.\nRiding thus, he reflected upon the nature of women and upon his love\nfor the Demoiselle de Puysange; and, to himself, he swore gloomily that\nif she had a mind to Hugues she must have Hugues, come what might.\nHaving reached this conclusion, Adhelmar wheeled upon his men, and\ncursed them for tavern-idlers and laggards and flea-hearted snails, and\nbade them spur.\n\nM\u00e9lite, at her window, heard them depart, and heard the noise of their\ngoing lapse into the bland monotony of the rain's noise. This dank night\nnow divulged no more, and she turned back into the room. Adhelmar's\nglove, which he had forgotten in his haste, lay upon the floor, and\nM\u00e9lite lifted it and twisted it idly.\n\n\"I wonder--?\" said she.\n\nShe lighted four wax candles and set them before a mirror that was in the\nroom. M\u00e9lite stood among them and looked into the mirror. She seemed very\ntall and very slender, and her loosened hair hung heavily about her\nbeautiful shallow face and fell like a cloak around her black-robed body,\nshowing against the black gown like melting gold; and about her were the\ntall, white candles tipped with still flames of gold. M\u00e9lite laughed--her\nlaughter was high and delicate, with the resonance of thin glass,--and\nraised her arms above her, head, stretching tensely like a cat before a\nfire, and laughed yet again.\n\n\"After all,\" said she, \"I do not wonder.\"\n\nM\u00e9lite sat before the mirror, and braided her hair, and sang to herself\nin a sweet, low voice, brooding with unfathomable eyes upon her image in\nthe glass, while the October rain beat about Puysange, and Adhelmar rode\nforth to save Hugues that must else be hanged.\n\nSang M\u00e9lite:\n\n  \"_Rustling leaves of the willow-tree\n  Peering downward at you and me,\n  And no man else in the world to see,\n\n  \"Only the birds, whose dusty coats\n  Show dark in the green,--whose throbbing throats\n  Turn joy to music and love to notes_.\n\n  \"Lean your body against the tree,\n  Lifting your red lips up to me,\n  M\u00e9lite, and kiss, with no man to see!\n\n  \"And let us laugh for a little:--Yea,\n  Let love and laughter herald the day\n  When laughter and love will be put away.\n\n  \"Then you will remember the willow-tree\n  And this very hour, and remember me,\n  M\u00e9lite,--whose face you will no more see!\n\n  \"So swift, so swift the glad time goes,\n  And Eld and Death with their countless woes\n  Draw near, and the end thereof no man knows,\n\n  \"Lean your body against the tree,\n  Lifting your red lips up to me,\n  M\u00e9lite, and kiss, with no man to see!\"_\n\nM\u00e9lite smiled as she sang; for this was a song that Adhelmar had made for\nher upon a May morning at Nointel, before he was a knight, when both were\nvery young. So now she smiled to remember the making of the verses which\nshe sang while the October rain was beating about Puysange.\n\n\n5. _Night-work_\n\nIt was not long before they came upon d'Andreghen and his men camped\nabout a great oak, with One-eyed Peire a-swing over their heads for a\nlamentable banner. A shrill sentinel, somewhere in the dark, demanded the\nnewcomers' business, but without receiving any adequate answer, for at\nthat moment Adhelmar gave the word to charge.\n\nThen it was as if all the devils in Pandemonium had chosen Normandy for\ntheir playground; and what took place in the night no man saw for the\ndarkness, so that I cannot tell you of it. Let it suffice that Adhelmar\nrode away before d'Andreghen had rubbed sleep well out of his eyes; and\nwith Adhelmar were Hugues d'Arques and some half of Adhelmar's men. The\nrest were dead, and Adhelmar was badly hurt, for he had burst open his\nold wound and it was bleeding under his armor. Of this he said nothing.\n\n\"Hugues,\" said he, \"do you and these fellows ride to the coast; thence\ntake ship for England.\"\n\nHe would have none of Hugues' thanks; instead, he turned and left Hugues\nto whimper out his gratitude to the skies, which spat a warm, gusty rain\nat him. Adhelmar rode again to Puysange, and as he went he sang.\n\nSang Adhelmar:\n\n  \"D'Andreghen in Normandy\n  Went forth to slay mine enemy;\n  But as he went\n  Lord God for me wrought marvellously;\n\n  \"Wherefore, I may call and cry\n  That am now about to die,\n  'I am content!'\n\n  \"Domine! Domine!\n  Gratias accipe!\n  Et meum animum\n  Recipe in coelum_!\"\n\n\n6. They Kiss at Parting\n\nWhen he had come to Puysange, Adhelmar climbed the stairs of the White\nTurret,--slowly, for he was growing very feeble now,--and so came again\nto M\u00e9lite crouching among the burned-out candles in the slate-colored\ntwilight which heralded dawn.\n\n\"He is safe,\" said Adhelmar. He told M\u00e9lite how Hugues was rescued and\nshipped to England, and how, if she would, she might straightway follow\nhim in a fishing-boat. \"For there is likely to be ugly work at Puysange,\"\nAdhelmar said, \"when the marshal comes. And he will come.\"\n\n\"But what will you do now, my cousin?\" asked M\u00e9lite.\n\n\"Holy Ouen!\" said Adhelmar; \"since I needs must die, I will die in\nFrance, not in the cold land of England.\"\n\n\"Die!\" cried M\u00e9lite. \"Are you hurt so sorely, then?\"\n\nHe grinned like a death's-head. \"My injuries are not incurable,\" said\nhe, \"yet must I die very quickly, for all that. The English King will\nhang me if I go thither, as he has sworn to do these eight years, because\nof that matter of Almerigo di Pavia: and if I stay in France, I must hang\nbecause of this night's work.\"\n\nM\u00e9lite wept. \"O God! O God!\" she quavered, two or three times, like one\nhurt in the throat. \"And you have done this for me! Is there no way to\nsave you, Adhelmar?\" she pleaded, with wide, frightened eyes that were\nlike a child's.\n\n\"None,\" said Adhelmar. He took both her hands in his, very tenderly. \"Ah,\nmy sweet,\" said he, \"must I, whose grave is already digged, waste breath\nupon this idle talk of kingdoms and the squabbling men who rule them? I\nhave but a brief while to live, and I wish to forget that there is aught\nelse in the world save you, and that I love you. Do not weep, M\u00e9lite! In\na little time you will forget me and be happy with this Hugues whom you\nlove; and I?--ah, my sweet, I think that even in my grave I shall dream\nof you and of your great beauty and of the exceeding love that I bore you\nin the old days.\"\n\n\"Ah, no, I shall not ever forget, O true and faithful lover! And, indeed,\nindeed, Adhelmar, I would give my life right willingly that yours might\nbe saved!\"\n\nShe had almost forgotten Hugues. Her heart was sad as she thought of\nAdhelmar, who must die a shameful death for her sake, and of the love\nwhich she had cast away. Beside it, the Sieur d'Arques' affection showed\nsomewhat tawdry, and M\u00e9lite began to reflect that, after all, she had\nliked Adhelmar almost as well.\n\n\"Sweet,\" said Adhelmar, \"do I not know you to the marrow? You will forget\nme utterly, for your heart is very changeable. Ah, Mother of God!\"\nAdhelmar cried, with a quick lift of speech; \"I am afraid to die, for the\nharsh dust will shut out the glory of your face, and you will forget!\"\n\n\"No; ah, no!\" M\u00e9lite whispered, and drew near to him. Adhelmar smiled, a\nlittle wistfully, for he did not believe that she spoke the truth; but it\nwas good to feel her body close to his, even though he was dying, and he\nwas content.\n\nBut by this time the dawn had come completely, flooding the room with its\nfirst thin radiance, and M\u00e9lite saw the pallor of his face and so knew\nthat he was wounded.\n\n\"Indeed, yes,\" said Adhelmar, when she had questioned him, \"for my breast\nis quite cloven through.\" And when she disarmed him, M\u00e9lite found a great\ncut in his chest which had bled so much that it was apparent he must die,\nwhether d'Andreghen and Edward of England would or no.\n\nM\u00e9lite wept again, and cried, \"Why had you not told me of this?\"\n\n\"To have you heal me, perchance?\" said Adhelmar. \"Ah, love, is hanging,\nthen, so sweet a death that I should choose it, rather than to die very\npeacefully in your arms? Indeed, I would not live if I might; for I have\nproven traitor to my King, and it is right that traitors should die; and,\nchief of all, I know that life can bring me naught more desirable than I\nhave known this night. What need, then, have I to live?\"\n\nM\u00e9lite bent over him; for as he spoke he had lain back in a tall carven\nchair by the east window. She was past speech. But now, for a moment, her\nlips clung to his, and her warm tears fell upon his face. What better\ndeath for a lover? thought Adhelmar.\n\nYet he murmured somewhat. \"Pity, always pity!\" he said, wearily. \"I shall\nnever win aught else of you, M\u00e9lite. For before this you have kissed me,\npitying me because you could not love me. And you have kissed me now,\npitying me because I may not live.\"\n\nBut M\u00e9lite, clasping her arms about his neck, whispered into his ear the\nmeaning of this last kiss, and at the honeyed sound of her whispering\nhis strength came back for a moment, and he strove to rise. The level\nsunlight through the open window smote full upon his face, which was\nvery glad. M\u00e9lite was conscious of her nobility in causing him such\ndelight at the last.\n\n\"God, God!\" cried Adhelmar, and he spread out his arms toward the dear,\nfamiliar world that was slowly taking form beneath them,--a world now\ninfinitely dear to him; \"all, my God, have pity and let me live a\nlittle longer!\"\n\nAs M\u00e9lite, half frightened, drew back from him, he crept out of his\nchair and fell prone at her feet. Afterward his hands stretched forward\ntoward her, clutching, and then trembled and were still.\n\nM\u00e9lite stood looking downward, wondering vaguely when she would next\nknow either joy or sorrow again. She was now conscious of no emotion\nwhatever. It seemed to her she ought to be more greatly moved. So the\nnew day found them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMARCH 2, 1414\n\n\"_Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou soldest\nhim for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg_?\"\n\n\n_In the chapel at Puysange you may still see the tomb of Adhelmar; but\nM\u00e9lite's bones lie otherwhere. \"Her heart was changeable,\" as old Nicolas\nsays, justly enough; and so in due time it was comforted.\n\nFor Hugues d'Arques--or Hugh Darke, as his name was Anglicized--presently\nstood high in the favor of King Edward. A fief was granted to Messire\nDarke, in Norfolk, where Hugues shortly built for himself a residence at\nYaxham, and began to look about for a wife: it was not long before he\nfound one.\n\nThis befell at Br\u00e9tigny when, in 1360, the Great Peace was signed\nbetween France and England, and Hugues, as one of the English embassy,\ncame face to face with Reinault and M\u00e9lite. History does not detail the\nmeeting; but, inasmuch as the Sieur d'Arques and M\u00e9lite de Puysange were\nmarried at Rouen the following October, doubtless it passed off\npleasantly enough.\n\nThe couple had sufficient in common to have qualified them for several\ndecades of mutual toleration. But by ill luck, M\u00e9lite died in child-birth\nthree years after her marriage. She had borne, in 1361, twin daughters,\nof whom Adelais died a spinster; the other daughter, Sylvia, circa 1378,\nfigured in an unfortunate love-affair with one of Sir Thomas Mowbray's\nattendants, but subsequently married Robert Vernon of Winstead. M\u00e9lite\nleft also a son, Hugh, born in 1363, who succeeded to his father's estate\nof Yaxham in 1387, in which year Hugues fell at the battle of Radcot\nBridge, fighting in behalf of the ill-fated Richard of Bordeaux.\n\nNow we turn to certain happenings in Eastcheap, at the Boar's Head\nTavern._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_The Episode Called Love-Letters of Falstaff_\n\n\nI. \"_That Gray Iniquity_\"\n\nThere was a sound of scuffling within as Sir John Falstaff--much\nbroken since his loss of the King's favor, and now equally decayed in\nwit and health and reputation--stood fumbling at the door of the Angel\nroom. He was particularly shaky this morning after a night of\nparticularly hard drinking.\n\nBut he came into the apartment singing, and, whatever the scuffling had\nmeant, found Bardolph in one corner employed in sorting garments from a\nclothes-chest, while at the extreme end of the room Mistress Quickly\ndemurely stirred the fire; which winked at the old knight rather\nknowingly.\n\n\"_Then came the bold Sir Caradoc_,\" carolled Sir John. \"Ah, mistress,\nwhat news?--_And eke Sir Pellinore_.--Did I rage last night, Bardolph?\nWas I a Bedlamite?\"\n\n\"As mine own bruises can testify,\" Bardolph assented. \"Had each one of\nthem a tongue, they would raise a clamor beside which Babel were as an\nheir weeping for his rich uncle's death; their testimony would qualify\nyou for any mad-house in England. And if their evidence go against the\ndoctor's stomach, the watchman at the corner hath three teeth--or,\nrather, hath them no longer, since you knocked them out last night--that\nwill, right willingly, aid him to digest it.\"\n\n\"Three, say you?\" asked the knight, rather stiffly lowering his great\nbody into his great chair set ready for him beside the fire. \"I would\nhave my valor in all men's mouths, but not in this fashion, for it is too\nbiting a jest. Three, say you? Well, I am glad it was no worse; I have a\ntender conscience, and that mad fellow of the north, Hotspur, sits\nheavily upon it, so that thus this Percy, being slain by my valor, is\n_per se_ avenged, a plague on him! Three, say you? I would to God my name\nwere not so terrible to the enemy as it is; I would I had 'bated my\nnatural inclination somewhat, and had slain less tall fellows by some\nthreescore. I doubt Agamemnon slept not well o' nights. Three, say you?\nGive the fellow a crown apiece for his mouldy teeth, if thou hast them;\nif thou hast them not, bid him eschew this vice of drunkenness, whereby\nhis misfortune hath befallen him, and thus win him heavenly crowns.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" began Bardolph, \"I doubt--\"\n\n\"Doubt not, sirrah!\" cried Sir John, testily; and continued, in a\nvirtuous manner: \"Was not the apostle reproved for that same sin? Thou\nart a Didymus, Bardolph;--an incredulous paynim, a most unspeculative\nrogue! Have I carracks trading in the Indies? Have I robbed the exchequer\nof late? Have I the Golden Fleece for a cloak? Nay, it is paltry gimlet,\nand that augurs badly. Why, does this knavish watchman take me for a\nraven to feed him in the wilderness? Tell him there are no such ravens\nhereabout; else had I ravenously limed the house-tops and set springes in\nthe gutters. Inform him that my purse is no better lined than his own\nbroken skull: it is void as a beggar's protestations, or a butcher's\nstall in Lent; light as a famished gnat, or the sighing of a new-made\nwidower; more empty than a last year's bird-nest, than a madman's eye,\nor, in fine, than the friendship of a king.\"\n\n\"But you have wealthy friends, Sir John,\" suggested the hostess of the\nBoar's Head Tavern, whose impatience had but very hardly waited for this\nopportunity to join in the talk. \"Yes, I warrant you, Sir John. Sir John,\nyou have a many wealthy friends; you cannot deny that, Sir John.\"\n\n\"Friends, dame?\" asked the knight, and cowered closer to the fire, as\nthough he were a little cold. \"I have no friends since Hal is King. I\nhad, I grant you, a few score of acquaintances whom I taught to play at\ndice; paltry young blades of the City, very unfledged juvenals! Setting\nmy knighthood and my valor aside, if I did swear friendship with these,\nI did swear to a lie. But this is a censorious and muddy-minded world, so\nthat, look you, even these sprouting aldermen, these foul bacon-fed\nrogues, have fled my friendship of late, and my reputation hath grown\nsomewhat more murky than Erebus. No matter! I walk alone, as one that\nhath the pestilence. No matter! But I grow old; I am not in the vaward of\nmy youth, mistress.\"\n\nHe nodded his head with extreme gravity; then reached for a cup of sack\nthat Bardolph held at the knight's elbow.\n\n\"Indeed, I know not what your worship will do,\" said Mistress Quickly,\nrather sadly.\n\n\"Faith!\" answered Sir John, finishing the sack and grinning in a somewhat\nghastly fashion; \"unless the Providence that watches over the fall of a\nsparrow hath an eye to the career of Sir John Falstaff, Knight, and so\ncomes to my aid shortly, I must needs convert my last doublet into a\nmask, and turn highwayman in my shirt. I can take purses yet, ye Uzzite\ncomforters, as gaily as I did at Gadshill, where that scurvy Poins, and\nhe that is now King, and some twoscore other knaves did afterward assault\nme in the dark; yet I peppered some of them, I warrant you!\"\n\n\"You must be rid of me, then, master,\" Bardolph interpolated. \"I for one\nhave no need of a hempen collar.\"\n\n\"Ah, well!\" said the knight, stretching himself in his chair as the\nwarmth of the liquor coursed through his inert blood; \"I, too, would be\nloth to break the gallows' back! For fear of halters, we must alter our\nway of living; we must live close, Bardolph, till the wars make us\nCroesuses or food for crows. And if Hal but hold to his bias, there will\nbe wars: I will eat a piece of my sword, if he have not need of it\nshortly. Ah, go thy ways, tall Jack; there live not three good men\nunhanged in England, and one of them is fat and grows old. We must live\nclose, Bardolph; we must forswear drinking and wenching! But there is\nlime in this sack, you rogue; give me another cup.\"\n\nThe old knight drained this second cup, and unctuously sucked at and\nlicked his lips. Thereafter,\n\n\"I pray you, hostess,\" he continued, \"remember that Doll Tearsheet sups\nwith me to-night; have a capon of the best, and be not sparing of the\nwine. I will repay you, upon honor, when we young fellows return from\nFrance, all laden with rings and brooches and such trumperies like your\nNorfolkshire pedlars at Christmas-tide. We will sack a town for you, and\nbring you back the Lord Mayor's beard to stuff you a cushion; the Dauphin\nshall be your tapster yet; we will walk on lilies, I warrant you, to the\ntune of _Hey, then up go we!\"_\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" said Mistress Quickly, in perfect earnest, \"your worship\nis as welcome to my pantry as the mice--a pox on 'em!--think themselves;\nyou are heartily welcome. Ah, well, old Puss is dead; I had her of\nGoodman Quickly these ten years since;--but I had thought you looked for\nthe lady who was here but now;--she was a roaring lion among the mice.\"\n\n\"What lady?\" cried Sir John, with great animation. \"Was it Flint the\nmercer's wife, think you? Ah, she hath a liberal disposition, and will,\nwithout the aid of Prince Houssain's carpet or the horse of Cambuscan,\ntransfer the golden shining pieces from her husband's coffers to mine.\"\n\n\"No mercer's wife, I think,\" Mistress Quickly answered, after\nconsideration. \"She came with two patched footmen, and smacked of\ngentility;--Master Dumbleton's father was a mercer; but he had red\nhair;--she is old;--and I could never abide red hair.\"\n\n\"No matter!\" cried the knight. \"I can love this lady, be she a very Witch\nof Endor. Observe, what a thing it is to be a proper man, Bardolph! She\nhath marked me;--in public, perhaps; on the street, it may be;--and then,\nI warrant you, made such eyes! and sighed such sighs! and lain awake o'\nnights, thinking of a pleasing portly gentleman, whom, were I not\nmodesty's self, I might name;--and I, all this while, not knowing! Fetch\nme my Book of Riddles and my Sonnets, that I may speak smoothly. Why was\nmy beard not combed this morning? No matter, it will serve. Have I no\nbetter cloak than this?\" Sir John was in a tremendous bustle, all a-beam\nwith pleasurable anticipation.\n\nBut Mistress Quickly, who had been looking out of the window, said,\n\"Come, but your worship must begin with unwashed hands, for old Madam\nWish-for't and her two country louts are even now at the door.\"\n\n\"Avaunt, minions!\" cried the knight. \"Avaunt! Conduct the lady hither,\nhostess; Bardolph, another cup of sack. We will ruffle it, lad, and go to\nFrance all gold, like Midas! Are mine eyes too red? I must look sad, you\nknow, and sigh very pitifully. Ah, we will ruffle it! Another cup of\nsack, Bardolph;--I am a rogue if I have drunk to-day. And avaunt! vanish!\nfor the lady comes.\"\n\nHe threw himself into a gallant attitude, suggestive of one suddenly\npalsied, and with the mien of a turkey-cock strutted toward the door to\ngreet his unknown visitor.\n\n\n2. _\"Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a Boy\"_\n\nThe woman who entered was not the jolly City dame one looked for: and, at\nfirst sight, you estimated her age as a trifle upon the staider side of\nsixty. But to this woman the years had shown unwonted kindliness, as\nthough time touched her less with intent to mar than to caress; her form\nwas still unbent, and her countenance, bloodless and deep-furrowed, bore\nthe traces of great beauty; and, whatever the nature of her errand, the\nwoman who stood in the doorway was unquestionably a person of breeding.\n\nSir John advanced toward her with as much elegance as he might muster;\nfor gout when coupled with such excessive bulk does not beget an\noverpowering amount of grace.\n\n\"_See, from the glowing East, Aurora comes_,\" he chirped. \"Madam, permit\nme to welcome you to my poor apartments; they are not worthy--\"\n\n\"I would see Sir John Falstaff, sir,\" declared the lady, courteously,\nbut with some reserve of manner, and looking him full in the face as she\nsaid this.\n\n\"Indeed, madam,\" suggested Sir John, \"if those bright eyes--whose glances\nhave already cut my poor heart into as many pieces as the man in the\nfront of the almanac--will but desist for a moment from such butcher's\nwork and do their proper duty, you will have little trouble in finding\nthe bluff soldier you seek.\"\n\n\"Are you Sir John?\" asked the lady, as though suspecting a jest. \"The son\nof old Sir Edward Falstaff, of Norfolk?\"\n\n\"His wife hath frequently assured me so,\" Sir John protested, very\ngravely; \"and to confirm her evidence I have about me a certain\nvillainous thirst that did plague Sir Edward sorely in his lifetime, and\ncame to me with his other chattels. The property I have expended long\nsince; but no Jew will advance me a maravedi on the Falstaff thirst. It\nis a priceless commodity, not to be bought or sold; you might as soon\nquench it.\"\n\n\"I would not have known you,\" said the lady, wonderingly; \"but,\" she\nadded, \"I have not seen you these forty years.\"\n\n\"Faith, madam,\" grinned the knight, \"the great pilferer Time hath since\nthen taken away a little from my hair, and added somewhat (saving your\npresence) to my belly; and my face hath not been improved by being the\ngrindstone for some hundred swords. But I do not know you.\"\n\n\"I am Sylvia Vernon,\" said the lady. \"And once, a long while ago, I was\nSylvia Darke.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said the knight. His voice was altered. Bardolph would\nhardly have known it; nor, perhaps, would he have recognized his master's\nmanner as he handed Dame Sylvia to the best chair.\n\n\"A long while ago,\" she repeated, sadly, after a pause during which\nthe crackling of the fire was very audible. \"Time hath dealt harshly\nwith us both, John;--the name hath a sweet savor. I am an old woman\nnow. And you--\"\n\n\"I would not have known you,\" said Sir John; then asked, almost\nresentfully, \"What do you here?\"\n\n\"My son goes to the wars,\" she answered, \"and I am come to bid him\nfarewell; yet I should not tarry in London, for my lord is feeble and\nhath constant need of me. But I, an old woman, am yet vain enough to\nsteal these few moments from him who needs me, to see for the last time,\nmayhap, him who was once my very dear friend.\"\n\n\"I was never your friend, Sylvia,\" said Sir John.\n\n\"Ah, the old wrangle!\" said the lady, and smiled a little wistfully. \"My\ndear and very honored lover, then; and I am come to see him here.\"\n\n\"Ay!\" interrupted Sir John, rather hastily; and he proceeded, glowing\nwith benevolence: \"A quiet, orderly place, where I bestow my patronage;\nthe woman of the house had once a husband in my company. God rest his\nsoul! he bore a good pike. He retired in his old age and 'stablished this\ntavern, where he passed his declining years, till death called him gently\naway from this naughty world. God rest his soul, say I!\"\n\nThis was a somewhat euphemistic version of the taking-off of Goodman\nQuickly, who had been knocked over the head with a joint-stool while\nrifling the pockets of a drunken guest; but perhaps Sir John wished to\nspeak well of the dead, even at the price of conferring upon the present\nhome of Sir John an idyllic atmosphere denied it by the London\nconstabulary.\n\n\"And you for old memories' sake yet aid his widow?\" the lady murmured.\n\"That is like you, John.\"\n\nThere was another silence, and the fire crackled more loudly than ever.\n\n\"And are you sorry that I come again, in a worse body, John, strange and\ntime-ruined?\"\n\n\"Sorry?\" echoed Sir John; and, ungallant as it was, he hesitated a\nmoment before replying: \"No, faith! But there are some ghosts that will\nnot easily bear raising, and you have raised one.\"\n\n\"We have summoned up no very fearful spectre, I think,\" replied the lady;\n\"at most, no worse than a pallid, gentle spirit that speaks--to me, at\nleast--of a boy and a girl who loved each other and were very happy a\ngreat while ago.\"\n\n\"Are you come hither to seek that boy?\" asked the knight, and chuckled,\nthough not merrily. \"The boy that went mad and rhymed of you in those\nfar-off dusty years? He is quite dead, my lady; he was drowned, mayhap,\nin a cup of wine. Or he was slain, perchance, by a few light women. I\nknow not how he died. But he is quite dead, my lady, and I had not been\nhaunted by his ghost until to-day.\"\n\nHe stared at the floor as he ended; then choked, and broke into a fit of\ncoughing which unromantic chance brought on just now, of all times.\n\n\"He was a dear boy,\" she said, presently; \"a boy who loved a young maid\nvery truly; a boy that found the maid's father too strong and shrewd for\ndesperate young lovers--Eh, how long ago it seems, and what a flood of\ntears the poor maid shed at being parted from that dear boy!\"\n\n\"Faith!\" admitted Sir John, \"the rogue had his good points.\"\n\n\"Ah, John, you have not forgotten, I know,\" the lady said, looking up\ninto his face, \"and, you will believe me that I am very heartily sorry\nfor the pain I brought into your life?\"\n\n\"My wounds heal easily,\" said Sir John.\n\n\"For though my dear dead father was too wise for us, and knew it was for\nthe best that I should not accept your love, believe me, John, I always\nknew the value of that love, and have held it an honor that any woman\nmust prize.\"\n\n\"Dear lady,\" the knight suggested, with a slight grimace, \"the world is\nnot altogether of your opinion.\"\n\n\"I know not of the world,\" she said; \"for we live away from it. But we\nhave heard of you ever and anon; I have your life quite letter-perfect\nfor these forty years or more.\"\n\n\"You have heard of me?\" asked Sir John; and, for a seasoned knave, he\nlooked rather uncomfortable.\n\n\"As a gallant and brave soldier,\" she answered; \"of how you fought at sea\nwith Mowbray that was afterward Duke of Norfolk; of your knighthood by\nKing Richard; of how you slew the Percy at Shrewsbury; and captured\nColeville o' late in Yorkshire; and how the Prince, that now is King, did\nlove you above all men; and, in fine, of many splendid doings in the\ngreat world.\"\n\nSir John raised a protesting hand. He said, with commendable modesty: \"I\nhave fought somewhat. But we are not Bevis of Southampton; we have slain\nno giants. Heard you naught else?\"\n\n\"Little else of note,\" replied the lady; and went on, very quietly: \"But\nwe are proud of you at home in Norfolk. And such tales as I have heard I\nhave woven together in one story; and I have told it many times to my\nchildren as we sat on the old Chapel steps at evening, and the shadows\nlengthened across the lawn, and I bid them emulate this, the most perfect\nknight and gallant gentleman that I have known. And they love you, I\nthink, though but by repute.\"\n\nOnce more silence fell between them; and the fire grinned wickedly at the\nmimic fire reflected by the old chest, as though it knew of a most\nentertaining secret.\n\n\"Do you yet live at Winstead?\" asked Sir John, half idly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered; \"in the old house. It is little changed, but there\nare many changes about.\"\n\n\"Is Moll yet with you that did once carry our letters?\"\n\n\"Married to Hodge, the tanner,\" the lady said; \"and dead long since.\"\n\n\"And all our merry company?\" Sir John demanded. \"Marian? And Tom and\nlittle Osric? And Phyllis? And Adelais? Zounds, it is like a breath of\ncountry air to speak their names once more.\"\n\n\"All dead,\" she answered, in a hushed voice, \"save Adelais, and even to\nme poor Adelais seems old and strange. Walter was slain in the French\nwars, and she hath never married.\"\n\n\"All dead,\" Sir John informed the fire, as if confidentially; then he\nlaughed, though his bloodshot eyes were not merry. \"This same Death hath\na wide maw! It is not long before you and I, my lady, will be at supper\nwith the worms. But you, at least, have had a happy life.\"\n\n\"I have been content enough,\" she said, \"but all that seems run by; for,\nJohn, I think that at our age we are not any longer very happy nor very\nmiserable.\"\n\n\"Faith!\" agreed Sir John, \"we are both old; and I had not known it, my\nlady, until to-day.\"\n\nAgain there was silence; and again the fire leapt with delight at the\njest.\n\nSylvia Vernon arose suddenly and cried, \"I would I had not come!\"\n\nThen said Sir John: \"Nay, this is but a feeble grieving you have wakened.\nFor, madam--you whom I loved once!--you are in the right. Our blood runs\nthinner than of yore; and we may no longer, I think, either sorrow or\nrejoice very deeply.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" she said; \"but I must go; and, indeed, I would to God I had\nnot come!\"\n\nSir John was silent; he bowed his head, in acquiescence perhaps, in\nmeditation it may have been; but he stayed silent.\n\n\"Yet,\" said she, \"there is something here which I must keep no longer:\nfor here are all the letters you ever writ me.\"\n\nWhereupon she handed Sir John a little packet of very old and very faded\npapers. He turned them awkwardly in his hand once or twice; then stared\nat them; then at the lady.\n\n\"You have kept them--always?\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" she responded, wistfully; \"but I must not be guilty of continuing\nsuch follies. It is a villainous example to my grandchildren,\" Dame\nSylvia told him, and smiled. \"Farewell.\"\n\nSir John drew close to her and took her hands in his. He looked into her\neyes for an instant, holding himself very erect,--and it was a rare event\nwhen Sir John looked any one squarely in the eyes,--and he said,\nwonderingly, \"How I loved you!\"\n\n\"I know,\" she murmured. Sylvia Vernon gazed up into his bloated old face\nwith a proud tenderness that was half-regretful. A quavering came into\nher gentle voice. \"And I thank you for your gift, my lover,--O brave true\nlover, whose love I was not ever ashamed to own! Farewell, my dear; yet a\nlittle while, and I go to seek the boy and girl we know of.\"\n\n\"I shall not be long, madam,\" said Sir John. \"Speak a kind word for me in\nHeaven; for I shall have sore need of it.\"\n\nShe had reached the door by this. \"You are not sorry that I came?\"\n\nSir John answered, very sadly: \"There are many wrinkles now in your dear\nface, my lady; the great eyes are a little dimmed, and the sweet\nlaughter is a little cracked; but I am not sorry to have seen you thus.\nFor I have loved no woman truly save you alone; and I am not sorry.\nFarewell.\" And for a moment he bowed his unreverend gray head over her\nshrivelled fingers.\n\n\n3. \"_This Pitch, as Ancient Writers do Report, doth Defile_\"\n\n\"Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to the vice of lying!\"\nchuckled Sir John, and leaned back rheumatically in his chair and\nmumbled over the jest.\n\n\"Yet it was not all a lie,\" he confided, as if in perplexity, to the\nfire; \"but what a coil over a youthful green-sickness 'twixt a lad and a\nwench more than forty years syne!\n\n\"I might have had money of her for the asking,\" he presently went on;\n\"yet I am glad I did not; which is a parlous sign and smacks of dotage.\"\n\nHe nodded very gravely over this new and alarming phase of his character.\n\n\"Were it not a quaint conceit, a merry tickle-brain of Fate,\" he asked of\nthe leaping flames, after a still longer pause, \"that this mountain of\nmalmsey were once a delicate stripling with apple cheeks and a clean\nbreath, smelling of civet, and as mad for love, I warrant you, as any\nAmadis of them all? For, if a man were to speak truly, I did love her.\n\n\"I had the special marks of the pestilence,\" he assured a particularly\nincredulous--and obstinate-looking coal,--a grim, black fellow that,\nlurking in a corner, scowled forbiddingly and seemed to defy both the\nflames and Sir John. \"Not all the flagons and apples in the universe\nmight have comforted me; I was wont to sigh like a leaky bellows; to weep\nlike a wench that hath lost her grandam; to lard my speech with the\nfag-ends of ballads like a man milliner; and did, indeed, indite sonnets,\ncanzonets, and what not of mine own elaboration.\n\n\"And Moll did carry them,\" he continued; \"plump brown-eyed Moll, that\nhath married Hodge the tanner, and reared her tannerkins, and died\nlong since.\"\n\nBut the coal remained incredulous, and the flames crackled merrily.\n\n\"Lord, Lord, what did I not write?\" said Sir John, drawing out a paper\nfrom the packet, and deciphering by the firelight the faded writing.\n\nRead Sir John:\n\n  \"_Have pity, Sylvia? Cringing at thy door\n  Entreats with dolorous cry and clamoring,\n  That mendicant who quits thee nevermore;\n  Now winter chills the world, and no birds sing\n  In any woods, yet as in wanton Spring\n  He follows thee; and never will have done,\n  Though nakedly he die, from following\n  Whither thou leadest.\n\n  \"Canst thou look upon\n  His woes, and laugh to see a goddess' son\n  Of wide dominion, and in strategy\n\n  \"More strong than Jove, more wise than Solomon,\n  Inept to combat thy severity?\n  Have pity, Sylvia! And let Love be one\n  Among the folk that bear thee company_.\"\n\n\"Is it not the very puling speech of your true lover?\" he chuckled; and\nthe flames spluttered assent. \"_Among the folk that bear thee company_,\"\nhe repeated, and afterward looked about him with a smack of gravity.\n\"Faith, Adam Cupid hath forsworn my fellowship long since; he hath no\nscore chalked up against him at the Boar's Head Tavern; or, if he have, I\ndoubt not the next street-beggar might discharge it.\"\n\n\"And she hath commended me to her children as a very gallant gentleman\nand a true knight,\" Sir John went on, reflectively. He cast his eyes\ntoward the ceiling, and grinned at invisible deities. \"Jove that sees all\nhath a goodly commodity of mirth; I doubt not his sides ache at times, as\nif they had conceived another wine-god.\"\n\n\"Yet, by my honor,\" he insisted to the fire; then added,\napologetically,--\"if I had any, which, to speak plain, I have not,--I am\nglad; it is a brave jest; and I did love her once.\"\n\nThen the time-battered, bloat rogue picked out another paper, and read:\n\n\"'_My dear lady,--That I am not with thee to-night is, indeed, no fault\nof mine; for Sir Thomas Mowbray hath need of me, he saith. Yet the\nservice that I have rendered him thus far is but to cool my heels in his\nantechamber and dream of two great eyes and of that net of golden hair\nwherewith Lord Love hath lately snared my poor heart. For it comforts\nme_--' And so on, and so on, the pen trailing most juvenal sugar, like a\nfly newly crept out of the honey-pot. And ending with a posy, filched, I\nwarrant you, from some ring.\n\n\"I remember when I did write her this,\" he explained to the fire. \"Lord,\nLord, if the fire of grace were not quite out of me, now should I be\nmoved. For I did write it; and it was sent with a sonnet, all of Hell,\nand Heaven, and your pagan gods, and other tricks of speech. It should be\nsomewhere.\"\n\nHe fumbled with uncertain fingers among the papers. \"Ah, here it is,\" he\nsaid at last, and he again began to read aloud.\n\nRead Sir John:\n\n  \"_Cupid invaded Hell, and boldly drove\n  Before him all the hosts of Erebus,\n  Till he had conquered: and grim Cerberus\n  Sang madrigals, the Furies rhymed of love,\n  Old Charon sighed, and sonnets rang above\n  The gloomy Styx; and even as Tantalus\n  Was Proserpine discrowned in Tartarus,\n  And Cupid regnant in the place thereof_.\n\n  \"_Thus Love is monarch throughout Hell to-day;\n  In Heaven we know his power was always great;\n  And Earth acclaimed Love's mastery straightway\n  When Sylvia came to gladden Earth's estate:--\n  Thus Hell and Heaven and Earth his rule obey,\n  And Sylvia's heart alone is obdurate_.\n\n\"Well, well,\" sighed Sir John, \"it was a goodly rogue that writ it,\nthough the verse runs but lamely! A goodly rogue!\n\n\"He might,\" Sir John suggested, tentatively, \"have lived cleanly, and\nforsworn sack; he might have been a gallant gentleman, and begotten\ngrandchildren, and had a quiet nook at the ingleside to rest his old\nbones: but he is dead long since. He might have writ himself _armigero_\nin many a bill, or obligation, or quittance, or what not; he might have\nleft something behind him save unpaid tavern bills; he might have heard\ncases, harried poachers, and quoted old saws; and slept in his own family\nchapel through sermons yet unwrit, beneath his presentment, done in\nstone, and a comforting bit of Latin: but he is dead long since.\"\n\nSir John sat meditating for a while; it had grown quite dark in the room\nas he muttered to himself. He rose now, rather cumbrously and\nuncertainly, but with a fine rousing snort of indignation.\n\n\"Zooks!\" he said, \"I prate like a death's-head. A thing done hath an end,\nGod have mercy on us all! And I will read no more of the rubbish.\"\n\nHe cast the packet into the heart of the fire; the yellow papers curled\nat the edges, rustled a little, and blazed; he watched them burn to the\nlast spark.\n\n\"A cup of sack to purge the brain!\" cried Sir John, and filled one to the\nbrim. \"And I will go sup with Doll Tearsheet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSEPTEMBER 29, 1422\n\n\"_Anoon her herte hath pitee of his wo,\nAnd with that pitee, love com in also;\nThus is this quene in pleasaunce and in loye_.\"\n\n\n_Meanwhile had old Dome Sylvia returned contentedly to the helpmate whom\nshe had accepted under compulsion, and who had made her a fair husband,\nas husbands go. It is duly recorded, indeed, on their shared tomb, that\ntheir forty years of married life were of continuous felicity, and set a\npattern to all Norfolk. The more prosaic verbal tradition is that Lady\nVernon retained Sir Robert well in hand by pointing out, at judicious\nintervals, that she had only herself to blame for having married such a\nselfish person in preference to a hero of the age and an ornament of the\nloftiest circles.\n\nI find, on consultation of the Allonby records, that Sylvia Vernon died\nof a quinsy, in 1419, surviving Sir Robert by some three months. She had\nborne him four sons and four daughters: of these there remained at\nWinstead in 1422 only Sir Hugh Vernon, the oldest son, knighted by Henry\nV at Agincourt, where Vernon had fought with distinction; and Adelais\nVernon, the youngest daughter, with whom the following has to do._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Episode Called \"Sweet Adelais\"_\n\n\n1. _Gruntings at Aeaea_\n\nIt was on a clear September day that the Marquis of Falmouth set out for\nFrance. John of Bedford had summoned him posthaste when Henry V was\nstricken at Senlis with what bid fair to prove a mortal distemper; for\nthe marquis was Bedford's comrade-in-arms, veteran of Shrewsbury,\nAgincourt and other martial disputations, and the Duke-Regent suspected\nthat, to hold France in case of the King's death, he would presently need\nall the help he could muster.\n\n\"And I, too, look for warm work,\" the marquis conceded to Mistress\nAdelais Vernon, at parting. \"But, God willing, my sweet, we shall be wed\nat Christmas for all that. The Channel is not very wide. At a pinch I\nmight swim it, I think, to come to you.\"\n\nHe kissed her and rode away with his men. Adelais stared after them,\nstriving to picture her betrothed rivalling Leander in this fashion, and\nsubsequently laughed. The marquis was a great lord and a brave captain,\nbut long past his first youth; his actions went somewhat too deliberately\never to be roused to the high lunacies of the Sestian amorist. So Adelais\nlaughed, but a moment later, recollecting the man's cold desire of her,\nhis iron fervors, Adelais shuddered.\n\nThis was in the court-yard at Winstead. Roger Darke of Yaxham, the girl's\ncousin, standing beside her, noted the gesture, and snarled.\n\n\"Think twice of it, Adelais,\" said he.\n\nWhereupon Mistress Vernon flushed like a peony. \"I honor him,\" she said,\nwith some irrelevance, \"and he loves me.\"\n\nRoger scoffed. \"Love, love! O you piece of ice! You gray-stone saint!\nWhat do you know of love?\" Master Darke caught both her hands in his.\n\"Now, by Almighty God, our Saviour and Redeemer, Jesus Christ!\" he said,\nbetween his teeth, his eyes flaming; \"I, Roger Darke, have offered you\nundefiled love and you have mocked at it. Ha, Tears of Mary! how I love\nyou! And you mean to marry this man for his title! Do you not believe\nthat I love you, Adelais?\" he whimpered.\n\nGently she disengaged herself. This was of a pattern with Roger's\nbehavior any time during the past two years. \"I suppose you do,\" Adelais\nconceded, with the tiniest possible shrug. \"Perhaps that is why I find\nyou so insufferable.\"\n\nAfterward Mistress Vernon turned on her heel and left Master Darke. In\nhis fluent invocation of Mahound and Termagaunt and other overseers of\nthe damned he presently touched upon eloquence.\n\n\n2. _Comes One with Moly_\n\nAdelais came into the walled garden of Winstead, aflame now with autumnal\nscarlet and gold. She seated herself upon a semicircular marble bench,\nand laughed for no apparent reason, and contentedly waited what Dame Luck\nmight send.\n\nShe was a comely maid, past argument or (as her lovers habitually\ncomplained) any adequate description. Circe, Colchian Medea, Viviane du\nLac, were their favorite analogues; and what old romancers had fabled\nconcerning these ladies they took to be the shadow of which Adelais\nVernon was the substance. At times these rhapsodists might have supported\ntheir contention with a certain speciousness, such as was apparent\nto-day, for example, when against the garden's hurly-burly of color, the\nprodigal blazes of scarlet and saffron and wine-yellow, the girl's green\ngown glowed like an emerald, and her eyes, too, seemed emeralds, vivid,\ninscrutable, of a clear verdancy that was quite untinged with either blue\nor gray. Very black lashes shaded them. The long oval of her face (you\nmight have objected), was of an absolute pallor, rarely quickening to a\nflush; but her petulant lips burned crimson, and her hair mimicked the\ndwindling radiance of the autumn sunlight and shamed it. All in all, the\naspect of Adelais Vernon was, beyond any questioning, spiced with a\nsorcerous tang; say, the look of a young witch shrewd at love-potions,\nbut ignorant of their flavor; yet before this the girl's comeliness had\nstirred men's hearts to madness, and the county boasted of it.\n\nPresently Adelais lifted her small imperious head, and then again she\nsmiled, for out of the depths of the garden, with an embellishment of\ndivers trills and roulades, came a man's voice that carolled blithely.\n\nSang the voice:\n\n  _\"Had you lived when earth was new\n  What had bards of old to do\n  Save to sing in praise of you?\n\n  \"Had you lived in ancient days,\n  Adelais, sweet Adelais,\n  You had all the ancients' praise,--\n  You whose beauty would have won\n  Canticles of Solomon,\n  Had the sage Judean king\n  Gazed upon this goodliest thing\n  Earth of Heaven's grace hath got.\n\n  \"Had you gladdened Greece, were not\n  All the nymphs of Greece forgot?\n\n  \"Had you trod Sicilian ways,\n  Adelais, sweet Adelais_,\n\n  \"You had pilfered all their praise:\n  Bion and Theocritus\n  Had transmitted unto us\n  Honeyed harmonies to tell\n  Of your beauty's miracle,\n  Delicate, desirable,\n  And their singing skill were bent\n  You-ward tenderly,--content,\n  While the world slipped by, to gaze\n  On the grace of you, and praise\n  Sweet Adelais_.\"\n\nHere the song ended, and a man, wheeling about the hedge, paused to\nregard her with adoring eyes. Adelais looked up at him, incredibly\nsurprised by his coming.\n\nThis was the young Sieur d'Arnaye, Hugh Vernon's prisoner, taken at\nAgincourt seven years earlier and held since then, by the King's command,\nwithout ransom; for it was Henry's policy to release none of the\nimportant French prisoners. Even on his death-bed he found time to\nadmonish his brother, John of Bedford, that four of these,--Charles\nd'Orleans and Jehan de Bourbon and Arthur de Rougemont and Fulke\nd'Arnaye,--should never be set at liberty. \"Lest,\" as the King said, with\na savor of prophecy, \"more fire be kindled in one day than all your\nendeavors can quench in three.\"\n\nPresently the Sieur d'Arnaye sighed, rather ostentatiously; and Adelais\nlaughed, and demanded the cause of his grief.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said,--his English had but a trace of accent,--\"I am\nafflicted with a very grave malady.\"\n\n\"What is the name of this malady?\" said she.\n\n\"They call it love, mademoiselle.\"\n\nAdelais laughed yet again and doubted if the disease were incurable. But\nFulke d'Arnaye seated himself beside her and demonstrated that, in his\ncase, it might not ever be healed.\n\n\"For it is true,\" he observed, \"that the ancient Scythians, who lived\nbefore the moon was made, were wont to cure this distemper by\nblood-letting under the ears; but your brother, mademoiselle, denies me\naccess to all knives. And the leech Aelian avers that it may be cured by\nthe herb agnea; but your brother, mademoiselle, will not permit that I go\ninto the fields in search of this herb. And in Greece--he, mademoiselle,\nI might easily be healed of my malady in Greece! For in Greece is the\nrock, Leucata Petra, from which a lover may leap and be cured; and the\nwell of the Cyziceni, from which a lover may drink and be cured; and the\nriver Selemnus, in which a lover may bathe and be cured: but your brother\nwill not permit that I go to Greece. You have a very cruel brother,\nmademoiselle; seven long years, no less, he has penned me here like a\nstarling in a cage.\"\n\nAnd Fulke d'Arnaye shook his head at her reproachfully.\n\nAfterward he laughed. Always this Frenchman found something at which to\nlaugh; Adelais could not remember in all the seven years a time when she\nhad seen him downcast. But while his lips jested of his imprisonment, his\neyes stared at her mirthlessly, like a dog at his master, and her gaze\nfell before the candor of the passion she saw in them.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Adelais, \"why will you not give your parole? Then you\nwould be free to come and go as you elected.\" A little she bent toward\nhim, a covert red showing in her cheeks. \"To-night at Halvergate the Earl\nof Brudenel holds the feast of Saint Michael. Give your parole, my lord,\nand come with us. There will be in our company fair ladies who may\nperhaps heal your malady.\"\n\nBut the Sieur d'Arnaye only laughed. \"I cannot give my parole,\" he said,\n\"since I mean to escape for all your brother's care.\" Then he fell to\npacing up and down before her. \"Now, by Monseigneur Saint M\u00e9dard and the\nEagle that sheltered him!\" he cried, in half-humorous self-mockery;\n\"however thickly troubles rain upon me, I think that I shall never give\nup hoping!\" After a pause, \"Listen, mademoiselle,\" he went on, more\ngravely, and gave a nervous gesture toward the east, \"yonder is France,\nsacked, pillaged, ruinous, prostrate, naked to her enemy. But at\nVincennes, men say, the butcher of Agincourt is dying. With him dies the\nEnglish power in France. Can his son hold that dear realm? Are those tiny\nhands with which this child may not yet feed himself capable to wield a\nsceptre? Can he who is yet beholden to nurses for milk distribute\nsustenance to the law and justice of a nation? He, I think not,\nmademoiselle! France will have need of me shortly. Therefore, I cannot\ngive my parole.\"\n\n\"Then must my brother still lose his sleep, lord, for always your\nsafe-keeping is in his mind. To-day at cock-crow he set out for the coast\nto examine those Frenchmen who landed yesterday.\"\n\nAt this he wheeled about. \"Frenchmen!\"\n\n\"Only Norman fishermen, lord, whom the storm drove to seek shelter in\nEngland. But he feared they had come to rescue you.\"\n\nFulke d'Arnaye shrugged his shoulders. \"That was my thought, too,\" he\nadmitted, with a laugh. \"Always I dream of escape, mademoiselle. Have a\ncare of me, sweet enemy! I shall escape yet, it may be.\"\n\n\"But I will not have you escape,\" said Adelais. She tossed her glittering\nlittle head. \"Winstead would not be Winstead without you. Why, I was but\na child, my lord, when you came. Have you forgotten, then, the lank,\nawkward child who used to stare at you so gravely?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he returned, and now his voice trembled and still the\nhunger in his eyes grew more great, \"I think that in all these years I\nhave forgotten nothing--not even the most trivial happening,\nmademoiselle,--wherein you had a part. You were a very beautiful child.\nLook you, I remember as if it were yesterday that you never wept when\nyour good lady mother--whose soul may Christ have in his keeping!--was\nforced to punish you for some little misdeed. No, you never wept; but\nyour eyes would grow wistful, and you would come to me here in the\ngarden, and sit with me for a long time in silence. 'Fulke,' you would\nsay, quite suddenly, 'I love you better than my mother.' And I told you\nthat it was wrong to make such observations, did I not, mademoiselle? My\nfaith, yes! but I may confess now that I liked it,\" Fulke d'Arnaye ended,\nwith a faint chuckle.\n\nAdelais sat motionless. Certainly it was strange, she thought, how the\nsound of this man's voice had power to move her. Certainly, too, this man\nwas very foolish.\n\n\"And now the child is a woman,--a woman who will presently be Marchioness\nof Falmouth. Look you, when I get free of my prison--and I shall get\nfree, never fear, mademoiselle,--I shall often think of that great lady.\nFor only God can curb a man's dreams, and God is compassionate. So I hope\nto dream nightly of a gracious lady whose hair is gold and whose eyes are\ncolored like the summer sea and whose voice is clear and low and very\nwonderfully sweet. Nightly, I think, the vision of that dear enemy will\nhearten me to fight for France by day. In effect, mademoiselle, your\ntraitor beauty will yet aid me to destroy your country.\"\n\nThe Sieur d'Arnaye laughed, somewhat cheerlessly, as he lifted her hand\nto his lips.\n\nAnd certainly also (she concluded her reflections) it was absurd how this\nman's touch seemed an alarm to her pulses. Adelais drew away from him.\n\n\"No!\" she said: \"remember, lord, I, too, am not free.\"\n\n\"Indeed, we tread on dangerous ground,\" the Frenchman assented, with a\nsad little smile. \"Pardon me, mademoiselle. Even were you free of your\ntrothplight--even were I free of my prison, most beautiful lady, I have\nnaught to offer you yonder in that fair land of France. They tell me that\nthe owl and the wolf hunt undisturbed where Arnaye once stood. My ch\u00e2teau\nis carpeted with furze and roofed with God's Heaven. That gives me a\nlarge estate--does it not?--but I may not reasonably ask a woman to share\nit. So I pray you pardon me for my nonsense, mademoiselle, and I pray\nthat the Marchioness of Falmouth may be very happy.\"\n\nAnd with that he vanished into the autumn-fired recesses of the garden,\nsinging, his head borne stiff. Oh, the brave man who esteemed misfortune\nso slightly! thought Adelais. She remembered that the Marquis of Falmouth\nrarely smiled; and once only--at a bull-baiting--had she heard him laugh.\nIt needed bloodshed, then, to amuse him, Adelais deduced, with that\nself-certainty in logic which is proper to youth; and the girl shuddered.\n\nBut through the scarlet coppices of the garden, growing fainter and yet\nmore faint, rang the singing of Fulke d'Arnaye.\n\nSang the Frenchman:\n\n  \"Had you lived in Roman times\n  No Catullus in his rhymes\n  Had lamented Lesbia's sparrow:\n  He had praised your forehead, narrow\n  As the newly-crescent moon,\n  White as apple-trees in June;\n  He had made some amorous tune\n  Of the laughing light Eros\n  Snared as Psyche-ward he goes\n  By your beauty,--by your slim,\n  White, perfect beauty.\n\n  \"After him\n  Horace, finding in your eyes\n  Horace limned in lustrous wise,\n  Would have made you melodies\n  Fittingly to hymn your praise,\n  Sweet Adelais.\"\n\n\n3. Roger is Explicit\n\nInto the midst of the Michaelmas festivities at Halvergate that night,\nburst a mud-splattered fellow in search of Sir Hugh Vernon. Roger Darke\nbrought him to the knight. The fellow then related that he came from\nSimeon de Beck, the master of Castle Rising, with tidings that a strange\nboat, French-rigged, was hovering about the north coast. Let Sir Hugh\nhave a care of his prisoner.\n\nVernon swore roundly. \"I must look into this,\" he said. \"But what shall I\ndo with Adelais?\"\n\n\"Will you not trust her to me?\" Roger asked. \"If so, cousin, I will very\ngladly be her escort to Winstead. Let the girl dance her fill while she\nmay, Hugh. She will have little heart for dancing after a month or so of\nFalmouth's company.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" Vernon assented; \"but the match is a good one, and she is\nbent upon it.\"\n\nSo presently he rode with his men to the north coast. An hour later Roger\nDarke and Adelais set out for Winstead, in spite of all Lady Brudenel's\nprotestations that Mistress Vernon had best lie with her that night at\nHalvergate.\n\nIt was a clear night of restless winds, neither warm nor chill, but fine\nSeptember weather. About them the air was heavy with the damp odors of\ndecaying leaves, for the road they followed was shut in by the autumn\nwoods, that now arched the way with sere foliage, rustling and whirring\nand thinly complaining overhead, and now left it open to broad splashes\nof moonlight, where fallen leaves scuttled about in the wind vortices.\nAdelais, elate with dancing, chattered of this and that as her gray mare\nambled homeward, but Roger was moody.\n\nPast Upton the road branched in three directions; here Master Darke\ncaught the gray mare's bridle and turned both horses to the left.\n\n\"Why, of whatever are you thinking!\" the girl derided him. \"Roger, this\nis not the road to Winstead!\"\n\nHe grinned evilly over his shoulder. \"It is the road to Yaxham, Adelais,\nwhere my chaplain expects us.\"\n\nIn a flash she saw it all as her eyes swept these desolate woods. \"You\nwill not dare!\"\n\n\"Will I not?\" said Roger. \"Faith, for my part, I think you have mocked me\nfor the last time, Adelais, since it is the wife's duty, as Paul very\njustly says, to obey.\"\n\nSwiftly she slipped from the mare. But he followed her. \"Oh, infamy!\" the\ngirl cried. \"You have planned this, you coward!\"\n\n\"Yes, I planned it,\" said Roger Darke. \"Yet I take no great credit\ntherefor, for it was simple enough. I had but to send a feigned message\nto your block-head brother. Ha, yes, I planned it, Adelais, and I planned\nit well. But I deal honorably. To-morrow you will be Mistress Darke,\nnever fear.\"\n\nHe grasped at her cloak as she shrank from him. The garment fell, leaving\nthe girl momentarily free, her festival jewels shimmering in the\nmoonlight, her bared shoulders glistening like silver. Darke, staring at\nher, giggled horribly. An instant later Adelais fell upon her knees.\n\n\"Sweet Christ, have pity upon Thy handmaiden! Do not forsake me, sweet\nChrist, in my extremity! Save me from this man!\" she prayed, with\nentire faith.\n\n\"My lady wife,\" said Darke, and his hot, wet hand sank heavily upon her\nshoulder, \"you had best finish your prayer before my chaplain, I think,\nsince by ordinary Holy Church is skilled to comfort the sorrowing.\"\n\n\"A miracle, dear lord Christ!\" the girl wailed. \"O sweet Christ, a\nmiracle!\"\n\n\"Faith of God!\" said Roger, in a flattish tone; \"what was that?\"\n\nFor faintly there came the sound of one singing.\n\nSang the distant voice:\n\n  _\"Had your father's household been\n  Guelfic-born or Ghibelline,\n  Beatrice were unknown\n  On her star-encompassed throne.\n\n  \"For, had Dante viewed your grace,\n  Adelais, sweet Adelais,\n  You had reigned in Bice's place,--\n  Had for candles, Hyades,\n  Rastaben, and Betelguese,--\n  And had heard Zachariel\n  Chaunt of you, and, chaunting, tell\n  All the grace of you, and praise\n  Sweet Adelais.\"_\n\n\n4. _Honor Brings a Padlock_\n\nAdelais sprang to her feet. \"A miracle!\" she cried, her voice shaking.\n\"Fulke, Fulke! to me, Fulke!\"\n\nMaster Darke hurried her struggling toward his horse. Darke was muttering\ncurses, for there was now a beat of hoofs in the road yonder that led to\nWinstead. \"Fulke, Fulke!\" the girl shrieked.\n\nThen presently, as Roger put foot to stirrup, two horsemen wheeled about\nthe bend in the road, and one of them leapt to the ground.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Fulke d'Arnaye, \"am I, indeed, so fortunate as to be\nof any service to you?\"\n\n\"Ho!\" cried Roger, with a gulp of relief, \"it is only the French\ndancing-master taking French leave of poor cousin Hugh! Man, but you\nstartled me!\"\n\nNow Adelais ran to the Frenchman, clinging to him the while that she told\nof Roger's tricks. And d'Arnaye's face set mask-like.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, when she had ended, \"you have wronged a sweet and\ninnocent lady. As God lives, you shall answer to me for this.\"\n\n\"Look you,\" Roger pointed out, \"this is none of your affair, Monsieur\nJackanapes. You are bound for the coast, I take it. Very well,--ka me,\nand I ka thee. Do you go your way in peace, and let us do the same.\"\n\nFulke d'Arnaye put the girl aside and spoke rapidly in French to his\ncompanion. Then with mincing agility he stepped toward Master Darke.\n\nRoger blustered. \"You hop-toad! you jumping-jack!\" said he, \"what do\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"Chastisement!\" said the Frenchman, and struck him in the face.\n\n\"Very well!\" said Master Darke, strangely quiet. And with that they\nboth drew.\n\nThe Frenchman laughed, high and shrill, as they closed, and afterward\nhe began to pour forth a voluble flow of discourse. Battle was wine\nto the man.\n\n\"Not since Agincourt, Master Coward--he, no!--have I held sword in hand.\nIt is a good sword, this,--a sharp sword, is it not? Ah, the poor\narm--but see, your blood is quite black-looking in this moonlight, and I\nhad thought cowards yielded a paler blood than brave men possess. We live\nand learn, is it not? Observe, I play with you like a child,--as I played\nwith your tall King at Agincourt when I cut away the coronet from his\nhelmet. I did not kill him--no!--but I wounded him, you conceive?\nPresently, I shall wound you, too. My compliments--you have grazed my\nhand. But I shall not kill you, because you are the kinsman of the\nfairest lady earth may boast, and I would not willingly shed the least\ndrop of any blood that is partly hers. Oh\u00e9, no! Yet since I needs must do\nthis ungallant thing--why, see, monsieur, how easy it is!\"\n\nThereupon he cut Roger down at a blow and composedly set to wiping his\nsword on the grass. The Englishman lay like a log where he had fallen.\n\n\"Lord,\" Adelais quavered, \"lord, have you killed him?\"\n\nFulke d'Arnaye sighed. \"H\u00e9las, no!\" said he, \"since I knew that you\ndid not wish it. See, mademoiselle,--I have but made a healthful and\nblood-letting small hole in him here. He will return himself to\nsurvive to it long time--Fie, but my English fails me, after these so\nmany years--\"\n\nD'Arnaye stood for a moment as if in thought, concluding his\nmeditations with a grimace. After that he began again to speak in\nFrench to his companion. The debate seemed vital. The stranger\ngesticulated, pleaded, swore, implored, summoned all inventions between\nthe starry spheres and the mud of Cocytus to judge of the affair; but\nFulke d'Arnaye was resolute.\n\n\"Behold, mademoiselle,\" he said, at length, \"how my poor Olivier excites\nhimself over a little matter. Olivier is my brother, most beautiful lady,\nbut he speaks no English, so that I cannot present him to you. He came to\nrescue me, this poor Olivier, you conceive. Those Norman fishermen of\nwhom you spoke to-day--but you English are blinded, I think, by the fogs\nof your cold island. Eight of the bravest gentlemen in France,\nmademoiselle, were those same fishermen, come to bribe my gaoler,--the\nincorruptible Tompkins, no less. H\u00e9, yes, they came to tell me that Henry\nof Monmouth, by the wrath of God King of France, is dead at Vincennes\nyonder, mademoiselle, and that France will soon be free of you English.\nFrance rises in her might--\" His nostrils dilated, he seemed taller; then\nhe shrugged. \"And poor Olivier grieves that I may not strike a blow for\nher,--grieves that I must go back to Winstead.\"\n\nD'Arnaye laughed as he caught the bridle of the gray mare and turned her\nso that Adelais might mount. But the girl, with a faint, wondering cry,\ndrew away from him.\n\n\"You will go back! You have escaped, lord, and you will go back!\"\n\n\"Why, look you,\" said the Frenchman, \"what else may I conceivably do? We\nare some miles from your home, most beautiful lady,--can you ride those\nfour long miles alone? in this night so dangerous? Can I leave you here\nalone in this so tall forest? H\u00e9, surely not. I am desolated,\nmademoiselle, but I needs must burden you with my company homeward.\"\n\nAdelais drew a choking breath. He had fretted out seven years of\ncaptivity. Now he was free; and lest she be harmed or her name be\nsmutched, however faintly, he would go back to his prison, jesting. \"No,\nno!\" she cried aloud.\n\nBut he raised a deprecating hand. \"You cannot go alone. Olivier here\nwould go with you gladly. Not one of those brave gentlemen who await me\nat the coast yonder but would go with you very, very gladly, for they\nlove France, these brave gentlemen, and they think that I can serve her\nbetter than most other men. That is very flattering, is it not? But all\nthe world conspires to flatter me, mademoiselle. Your good brother, by\nexample, prizes my company so highly that he would infallibly hang the\ngentleman who rode back with you. So, you conceive, I cannot avail myself\nof their services. But with me it is different, hein? Ah, yes, Sir Hugh\nwill merely lock me up again and for the future guard me more vigilantly.\nWill you not mount, mademoiselle?\"\n\nHis voice was quiet, and his smile never failed him. It was this steady\nsmile which set her heart to aching. Adelais knew that no natural power\ncould dissuade him; he would go back with her; but she knew how\nconstantly he had hoped for liberty, with what fortitude he had awaited\nhis chance of liberty; and that he should return to captivity, smiling,\nthrilled her to impotent, heart-shaking rage. It maddened her that he\ndared love her thus infinitely.\n\n\"But, mademoiselle,\" Fulke d'Arnaye went on, when she had mounted, \"let\nus proceed, if it so please you, by way of Filby. For then we may ride a\nlittle distance with this rogue Olivier. I may not hope to see Olivier\nagain in this life, you comprehend, and Olivier is, I think, the one\nperson who loves me in all this great wide world. Me, I am not very\npopular, you conceive. But you do not object, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"No!\" she said, in a stifled voice.\n\nAfterward they rode on the way to Filby, leaving Roger Darke to regain at\ndiscretion the mastership of his faculties. The two Frenchmen as they\nwent talked vehemently; and Adelais, following them, brooded on the\npowerful Marquis of Falmouth and the great lady she would shortly be; but\nher eyes strained after Fulke d'Arnaye.\n\nPresently he fell a-singing; and still his singing praised her in a\ndesirous song, yearning but very sweet, as they rode through the autumn\nwoods; and his voice quickened her pulses as always it had the power to\nquicken them, and in her soul an interminable battling dragged on.\n\nSang Fulke d'Arnaye:\n\n  _\"Had you lived when earth was new\n  What had bards of old to do\n  Save to sing in praise of you?\n\n  \"They had sung of you always,\n  Adelais, sweet Adelais,\n  As worthiest of all men's praise;\n  Nor had undying melodies,\n  Wailed soft as love may sing of these\n  Dream-hallowed names,--of H\u00e9lo\u00efse,\n  Ysoude, Salom\u00ea, Semel\u00ea,\n  Morgaine, Lucrece, Antiop\u00ea,\n  Brunhilda, Helen, M\u00e9lusine,\n  Penelope, and Magdalene:\n  --But you alone had all men's praise,\n  Sweet Adelais\"_\n\n\n5. _\"Thalatta!\"_\n\nWhen they had crossed the Bure, they had come into the open country,--a\ngreat plain, gray in the moonlight, that descended, hillock by hillock,\ntoward the shores of the North Sea. On the right the dimpling lustre of\ntumbling waters stretched to a dubious sky-line, unbroken save for the\nsail of the French boat, moored near the ruins of the old Roman\nstation, Garianonum, and showing white against the unresting sea, like\na naked arm; to the left the lights of Filby flashed their unblinking,\ncordial radiance.\n\nHere the brothers parted. Vainly Olivier wept and stormed before\nFulke's unwavering smile; the Sieur d'Arnaye was adamantean: and\npresently the younger man kissed him on both cheeks and rode slowly\naway toward the sea.\n\nD'Arnaye stared after him. \"Ah, the brave lad!\" said Fulke d'Arnaye. \"And\nyet how foolish! Look you, mademoiselle, that rogue is worth ten of me,\nand he does not even suspect it.\"\n\nHis composure stung her to madness.\n\n\"Now, by the passion of our Lord and Saviour!\" Adelais cried, wringing\nher hands in impotence; \"I conjure you to hear me, Fulke! You must not do\nthis thing. Oh, you are cruel, cruel! Listen, my lord,\" she went on with\nmore restraint, when she had reined up her horse by the side of his,\n\"yonder in France the world lies at your feet. Our great King is dead.\nFrance rises now, and France needs a brave captain. You, you! it is you\nthat she needs. She has sent for you, my lord, that mother France whom\nyou love. And you will go back to sleep in the sun at Winstead when\nFrance has need of you. Oh, it is foul!\"\n\nBut he shook his head. \"France is very dear to me,\" he said, \"yet there\nare other men who can serve France. And there is no man save me who may\nto-night serve you, most beautiful lady.\"\n\n\"You shame me!\" she cried, in a gust of passion. \"You shame my\nworthlessness with this mad honor of yours that drags you jesting to your\ndeath! For you must die a prisoner now, without any hope. You and Orleans\nand Bourbon are England's only hold on France, and Bedford dare not let\nyou go. Fetters, chains, dungeons, death, torture perhaps--that is what\nyou must look for now. And you will no longer be held at Winstead, but in\nthe strong Tower at London.\"\n\n\"H\u00e9las, you speak more truly than an oracle,\" he gayly assented.\n\nAnd hers was the ageless thought of women. \"This man is rather foolish\nand peculiarly dear to me. What shall I do with him? and how much must I\nhumor him in his foolishness?\"\n\nD'Arnaye stayed motionless: but still his eyes strained after Olivier.\n\nWell, she would humor him. There was no alternative save that of perhaps\nnever seeing Fulke again.\n\nAdelais laid her hand upon his arm. \"You love me. God knows, I am not\nworthy of it, but you love me. Ever since I was a child you have loved\nme,--always, always it was you who indulged me, shielded me, protected me\nwith this fond constancy that I have not merited. Very well,\"--she\npaused, for a single heartbeat,--\"go! and take me with you.\"\n\nThe hand he raised shook as though palsied. \"O most beautiful!\" the\nFrenchman cried, in an extreme of adoration; \"you would do that! You\nwould do that in pity to save me--unworthy me! And it is I whom you call\nbrave--me, who annoy you with my woes so petty!\" Fulke d'Arnaye slipped\nfrom his horse, and presently stood beside the gray mare, holding a\nsmall, slim hand in his. \"I thank you,\" he said, simply. \"You know that\nit is impossible. But yes, I have loved you these long years. And\nnow--Ah, my heart shakes, my words tumble, I cannot speak! You know that\nI may not--may not let you do this thing. Why, but even if, of your\nprodigal graciousness, mademoiselle, you were so foolish as to waste a\nlittle liking upon my so many demerits--\" He gave a hopeless gesture.\n\"Why, there is always our brave marquis to be considered, who will so\nsoon make you a powerful, rich lady. And I?--I have nothing.\"\n\nBut Adelais had rested either hand upon a stalwart shoulder, bending down\nto him till her hair brushed his. Yes, this man was peculiarly dear to\nher: she could not bear to have him murdered when in equity he deserved\nonly to have his jaws boxed for his toplofty nonsense about her; and,\nafter all, she did not much mind humoring him in his foolishness.\n\n\"Do you not understand?\" she whispered. \"Ah, my paladin, do you think I\nspeak in pity? I wished to be a great lady,--yes. Yet always, I think, I\nloved you, Fulke, but until to-night I had believed that love was only\nthe man's folly, the woman's diversion. See, here is Falmouth's ring.\"\nShe drew it from her finger, and flung it awkwardly, as every woman\nthrows. Through the moonlight it fell glistening. \"Yes, I hungered for\nFalmouth's power, but you have shown me that which is above any temporal\npower. Ever I must crave the highest, Fulke--Ah, fair sweet friend, do\nnot deny me!\" Adelais cried, piteously. \"Take me with you, Fulke! I will\nride with you to the wars, my lord, as your page; I will be your wife,\nyour slave, your scullion. I will do anything save leave you. Lord, it is\nnot the maid's part to plead thus!\"\n\nFulke d'Arnaye drew her warm, yielding body toward him and stood in\nsilence. Then he raised his eyes to heaven. \"Dear Lord God,\" he cried, in\na great voice, \"I entreat of Thee that if through my fault this woman\never know regret or sorrow I be cast into the nethermost pit of Hell for\nall eternity!\" Afterward he kissed her.\n\nAnd presently Adelais lifted her head, with a mocking little laugh.\n\"Sorrow!\" she echoed. \"I think there is no sorrow in all the world.\nMount, my lord, mount! See where brother Olivier waits for us yonder.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJUNE 5, 1455--AUGUST 4, 1462\n\n_\"Fortune fuz par clercs jadis nomin\u00e9e, Qui toi, Fran\u00e7ois, crie et nomme\nmeurtri\u00e8re.\"_\n\n\n_So it came about that Adelais went into France with the great-grandson\nof Tiburce d'Arnaye: and Fulke, they say, made her a very fair husband.\nBut he had not, of course, much time for love-making.\n\nFor in France there was sterner work awaiting Fulke d'Arnaye, and he set\nabout it: through seven dreary years he and Rougemont and Dunois managed,\nsomehow, to bolster up the cause of the fat-witted King of Bourges (as\nthe English then called him), who afterward became King Charles VII of\nFrance. But in the February of 1429--four days before the Maid of Domremy\nset forth from her voice-haunted Bois Chenu to bring about a certain\ncoronation in Rheims Church and in Rouen Square a flamy martyrdom--four\ndays before the coming of the good Lorrainer, Fulke d'Arnaye was slain at\nRouvray-en-Beausse in that encounter between the French and the English\nwhich history has commemorated as the Battle of the Herrings.\n\nAdelais was wooed by, and betrothed to, the powerful old Comte de\nVaudremont; but died just before the date set for this second marriage,\nin October, 1429. She left two sons: No\u00ebl, born in 1425, and Raymond,\nborn in 1426; who were reared by their uncle, Olivier d'Arnaye. It was\nsaid of them that Noel was the handsomest man of his times, and Raymond\nthe most shrewd; concerning that you will judge hereafter. Both of these\nd'Arnayes, on reaching manhood, were identified with the Dauphin's party\nin the unending squabbles between Charles VII and the future Louis XI.\n\nNow you may learn how No\u00ebl d'Arnaye came to be immortalized by a legacy\nof two hundred and twenty blows from an osierwhip--since (as the testator\npiously affirms), \"chastoy est une belle aulmosne.\"_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Episode Called In Necessity's Mortar_\n\n\n1. \"Bon Bec de Paris\"\n\nThere went about the Rue Saint Jacques a notable shaking of heads on the\nday that Catherine de Vaucelles was betrothed to Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" said the Rue Saint Jacques; \"the girl is a fool. Why has\nshe not taken No\u00ebl d'Arnaye,--No\u00ebl the Handsome? I grant you No\u00ebl is an\nass, but, then, look you, he is of the nobility. He has the Dauphin's\nfavor. No\u00ebl will be a great man when our exiled Dauphin comes back from\nGeneppe to be King of France. Then, too, she might have had Philippe\nSermaise. Sermaise is a priest, of course, and one may not marry a\npriest, but Sermaise has money, and Sermaise is mad for love of her. She\nmight have done worse. But Fran\u00e7ois! Ho, death of my life, what is\nFran\u00e7ois? Perhaps--he, he!--perhaps Ysabeau de Montigny might inform us,\nyou say? Doubtless Ysabeau knows more of him than she would care to\nconfess, but I measure the lad by other standards. Fran\u00e7ois is\ninoffensive enough, I dare assert, but what does Catherine see in him? He\nis a scholar?--well, the College of Navarre has furnished food for the\ngallows before this. A poet?--rhyming will not fill the pot. Rhymes are a\nthin diet for two lusty young folk like these. And who knows if Guillaume\nde Villon, his foster-father, has one sou to rub against another? He is\ncanon at Saint Ben\u00f4it-le-B\u00e9tourn\u00e9 yonder, but canons are not Midases. The\ngirl will have a hard life of it, neighbor, a hard life, I tell you,\nif--but, yes!--if Ysabeau de Montigny does not knife her some day. Oh,\nbeyond doubt, Catherine has played the fool.\"\n\nThus far the Rue Saint Jacques.\n\nThis was on the day of the F\u00eate-Dieu. It was on this day that No\u00ebl\nd'Arnaye blasphemed for a matter of a half-hour and then went to the\nCrowned Ox, where he drank himself into a contented insensibility; that\nYsabeau de Montigny, having wept a little, sent for Gilles Raguyer, a\npriest and aforetime a rival of Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier for her favors;\nand that Philippe Sermaise grinned and said nothing. But afterward\nSermaise gnawed at his under lip like a madman as he went about seeking\nfor Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier.\n\n\n2. \"_Deux estions, et n'avions qu'ung Cueur_\"\n\nIt verged upon nine in the evening--a late hour in those days--when\nFran\u00e7ois climbed the wall of Jehan de Vaucelles' garden.\n\nA wall!--and what is a wall to your true lover? What bones, pray, did the\nSieur Pyramus, that ill-starred Babylonish knight, make of a wall? did\nnot his protestations slip through a chink, mocking at implacable granite\nand more implacable fathers? Most assuredly they did; and Pyramus was a\npattern to all lovers. Thus ran the meditations of Master Fran\u00e7ois as he\nleapt down into the garden.\n\nHe had not, you must understand, seen Catherine for three hours. Three\nhours! three eternities rather, and each one of them spent in Malebolge.\nComing to a patch of moonlight, Fran\u00e7ois paused there and cut an agile\ncaper, as he thought of that approaching time when he might see Catherine\nevery day.\n\n\"Madame Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier,\" he said, tasting each syllable with\ngusto. \"Catherine de Montcorbier. Was there ever a sweeter juxtaposition\nof sounds? It is a name for an angel. And an angel shall bear it,--eh,\nyes, an angel, no less. O saints in Paradise, envy me! Envy me,\" he\ncried, with a heroical gesture toward the stars, \"for Fran\u00e7ois would\nchange places with none of you.\"\n\nHe crept through ordered rows of chestnuts and acacias to a window\nwherein burned a dim light. He unslung a lute from his shoulder and\nbegan to sing, secure in the knowledge that deaf old Jehan de Vaucelles\nwas not likely to be disturbed by sound of any nature till that time\nwhen it should please high God that the last trump be noised about the\ntumbling heavens.\n\nIt was good to breathe the mingled odor of roses and mignonette that was\nthick about him. It was good to sing to her a wailing song of unrequited\nlove and know that she loved him. Fran\u00e7ois dallied with his bliss,\nparodied his bliss, and--as he complacently reflected,--lamented in the\nmoonlight with as tuneful a dolor as Messire Orpheus may have evinced\nwhen he carolled in Hades.\n\nSang Fran\u00e7ois:\n\n  _\"O Beauty of her, whereby I am undone!\n  O Grace of her, that hath no grace for me!\n  O Love of her, the bit that guides me on\n  To sorrow and to grievous misery!\n  O felon Charms, my poor heart's enemy!\n  O furtive murderous Pride! O pitiless, great\n  Cold Eyes of her! have done with cruelty!\n  Have pity upon me ere it be too late!\n\n  \"Happier for me if elsewhere I had gone\n  For pity--ah, far happier for me,\n  Since never of her may any grace be won,\n  And lest dishonor slay me, I must flee.\n  'Haro!' I cry, (and cry how uselessly!)\n  'Haro!' I cry to folk of all estate,\n\n  \"For I must die unless it chance that she\n  Have pity upon me ere it be too late.\n\n  \"M'amye, that day in whose disastrous sun\n  Your beauty's flower must fade and wane and be\n  No longer beautiful, draws near,--whereon\n  I will nor plead nor mock;--not I, for we\n  Shall both be old and vigorless! M'amye,\n  Drink deep of love, drink deep, nor hesitate\n  Until the spring run dry, but speedily\n  Have pity upon me--ere it be too late!\n\n  \"Lord Love, that all love's lordship hast in fee,\n  Lighten, ah, lighten thy displeasure's weight,\n  For all true hearts should, of Christ's charity,\n  Have pity upon me ere it be too late.\"_\n\nThen from above a delicate and cool voice was audible. \"You have mistaken\nthe window, Monsieur de Montcorbier. Ysabeau de Montigny dwells in the\nRue du Fouarre.\"\n\n\"Ah, cruel!\" sighed Fran\u00e7ois. \"Will you never let that kite hang upon\nthe wall?\"\n\n\"It is all very well to groan like a bellows. Guillemette Moreau did not\nsup here for nothing. I know of the verses you made her,--and the gloves\nyou gave her at Candlemas, too. Saint Anne!\" observed the voice, somewhat\nsharply; \"she needed gloves. Her hands are so much raw beef. And the\nhead-dress at Easter,--she looks like the steeple of Saint Benoit in it.\nBut every man to his taste, Monsieur de Montcorbier. Good-night, Monsieur\nde Montcorbier.\" But, for all that, the window did not close.\n\n\"Catherine--!\" he pleaded; and under his breath he expressed uncharitable\naspirations as to the future of Guillemette Moreau.\n\n\"You have made me very unhappy,\" said the voice, with a little sniff.\n\n\"It was before I knew you, Catherine. The stars are beautiful, m'amye,\nand a man may reasonably admire them; but the stars vanish and are\nforgotten when the sun appears.\"\n\n\"Ysabeau is not a star,\" the voice pointed out; \"she is simply a lank,\ngood-for-nothing, slovenly trollop.\"\n\n\"Ah, Catherine--!\"\n\n\"You are still in love with her.\"\n\n\"Catherine--!\"\n\n\"Otherwise, you will promise me for the future to avoid her as you would\nthe Black Death.\"\n\n\"Catherine, her brother is my friend--!\"\n\n\"Ren\u00e9 de Montigny is, to the knowledge of the entire Rue Saint Jacques, a\ngambler and a drunkard and, in all likelihood, a thief. But you prefer,\nit appears, the Montignys to me. An ill cat seeks an ill rat. Very\nheartily do I wish you joy of them. You will not promise? Good-night,\nthen, Monsieur de Montcorbier.\"\n\n\"Mother of God! I promise, Catherine.\"\n\nFrom above Mademoiselle de Vaucelles gave a luxurious sigh. \"Dear\nFran\u00e7ois!\" said she.\n\n\"You are a tyrant,\" he complained. \"Madame Penthesilea was not more\ncruel. Madame Herodias was less implacable, I think. And I think that\nneither was so beautiful.\"\n\n\"I love you,\" said Mademoiselle de Vaucelles, promptly.\n\n\"But there was never any one so many fathoms deep in love as I. Love\nbandies me from the postern to the frying-pan, from hot to cold. Ah,\nCatherine, Catherine, have pity upon my folly! Bid me fetch you Prester\nJohn's beard, and I will do it; bid me believe the sky is made of\ncalf-skin, that morning is evening, that a fat sow is a windmill, and I\nwill do it. Only love me a little, dear.\"\n\n\"My king, my king of lads!\" she murmured.\n\n\"My queen, my tyrant of unreason! Ah, yes, you are all that is ruthless\nand abominable, but then what eyes you have! Oh, very pitiless, large,\nlovely eyes--huge sapphires that in the old days might have ransomed\nevery monarch in Tamerlane's stable! Even in the night I see them,\nCatherine.\"\n\n\"Yet Ysabeau's eyes are brown.\"\n\n\"Then are her eyes the gutter's color. But Catherine's eyes are twin\nfirmaments.\"\n\nAnd about them the acacias rustled lazily, and the air was sweet\nwith the odors of growing things, and the world, drenched in\nmoonlight, slumbered. Without was Paris, but old Jehan's garden-wall\ncloistered Paradise.\n\n\"Has the world, think you, known lovers, long dead now, that were once as\nhappy as we?\"\n\n\"Love was not known till we discovered it.\"\n\n\"I am so happy, Fran\u00e7ois, that I fear death.\"\n\n\"We have our day. Let us drink deep of love, not waiting until the spring\nrun dry. Catherine, death comes to all, and yonder in the church-yard the\npoor dead lie together, huggermugger, and a man may not tell an\narchbishop from a rag-picker. Yet they have exulted in their youth, and\nhave laughed in the sun with some lass or another lass. We have our day,\nCatherine.\"\n\n\"Our day wherein I love you!\"\n\n\"And wherein I love you precisely seven times as much!\"\n\nSo they prattled in the moonlight. Their discourse was no more\noverburdened with wisdom than has been the ordinary communing of lovers\nsince Adam first awakened ribless. Yet they were content, who, were young\nin the world's recaptured youth.\n\nFate grinned and went on with her weaving.\n\n\n3. \"Et Ysabeau, Qui Dit: Enn\u00e9!\"\n\nSomewhat later Fran\u00e7ois came down the deserted street, treading on air.\nIt was a bland summer night, windless, moon-washed, odorous with\ngarden-scents; the moon, nearing its full, was a silver egg set on\nend--(\"Leda-hatched,\" he termed it; \"one may look for the advent of Queen\nHeleine ere dawn\"); and the sky he likened to blue velvet studded with\nthe gilt nail-heads of a seraphic upholsterer. Fran\u00e7ois was a poet, but a\ncivic poet; then, as always, he pilfered his similes from shop-windows.\n\nBut the heart of Fran\u00e7ois was pure magnanimity, the heels of Fran\u00e7ois\nwere mercury, as he tripped past the church of Saint Benoit-le-B\u00e9tourn\u00e9,\nstark snow and ink in the moonlight. Then with a jerk Fran\u00e7ois paused.\n\nOn a stone bench before the church sat Ysabeau de Montigny and Gilles\nRaguyer. The priest was fuddled, hiccuping in his amorous dithyrambics as\nhe paddled with the girl's hand. \"You tempt me to murder,\" he was saying.\n\"It is a deadly sin, my soul, and I have no mind to fry in Hell while my\nbody swings on the Saint Denis road, a crow's dinner. Let Fran\u00e7ois live,\nmy soul! My soul, he would stick little Gilles like a pig.\"\n\nRaguyer began to blubber at the thought.\n\n\"Holy Macaire!\" said Fran\u00e7ois; \"here is a pretty plot a-brewing.\" Yet\nbecause his heart was filled just now with loving-kindness, he forgave\nthe girl. _\"Tantaene irae?\"_ said Fran\u00e7ois; and aloud, \"Ysabeau, it is\ntime you were abed.\"\n\nShe wheeled upon him in apprehension; then, with recognition, her rage\nflamed. \"Now, Gilles!\" cried Ysabeau de Montigny; \"now, coward! He is\nunarmed, Gilles. Look, Gilles! Kill for me this betrayer of women!\"\n\nUnder his mantle Francois loosened the short sword he carried. But the\npriest plainly had no mind to the business. He rose, tipsily fumbling a\nknife, and snarling like a cur at sight of a strange mastiff. \"Vile\nrascal!\" said Gilles Raguyer, as he strove to lash himself into a rage.\n\"O coward! O parricide! O Tarquin!\"\n\nFran\u00e7ois began to laugh. \"Let us have done with this farce,\" said he.\n\"Your man has no stomach for battle, Ysabeau. And you do me wrong, my\nlass, to call me a betrayer of women. Doubtless, that tale seemed the\nmost apt to kindle in poor Gilles some homicidal virtue: but you and I\nand God know that naught has passed between us save a few kisses and a\ntrinket or so. It is no knifing matter. Yet for the sake of old time,\ncome home, Ysabeau; your brother is my friend, and the hour is somewhat\nlate for honest women to be abroad.\"\n\n\"Enn\u00e9?\" shrilled Ysabeau; \"and yet, if I cannot strike a spark of courage\nfrom this clod here, there come those who may help me, Fran\u00e7ois de\nMontcorbier. 'Ware Sermaise, Master Fran\u00e7ois!\"\n\nFran\u00e7ois wheeled. Down the Rue Saint Jacques came Philippe Sermaise, like\na questing hound, with drunken Jehan le Merdi at his heels. \"Holy\nVirgin!\" thought Fran\u00e7ois; \"this is likely to be a nasty affair. I would\ngive a deal for a glimpse of the patrol lanterns just now.\"\n\nHe edged his way toward the cloister, to get a wall at his back. But\nGilles Raguyer followed him, knife in hand. \"O hideous Tarquin! O\nAbsalom!\" growled Gilles; \"have you, then, no respect for churchmen?\"\n\nWith an oath, Sermaise ran up. \"Now, may God die twice,\" he panted, \"if I\nhave not found the skulker at last! There is a crow needs picking between\nus two, Montcorbier.\"\n\nHemmed in by his enemies, Fran\u00e7ois temporized. \"Why do you accost me thus\nangrily, Master Philippe?\" he babbled. \"What harm have I done you? What\nis your will of me?\"\n\nBut his fingers tore feverishly at the strap by which the lute was swung\nover his shoulder, and now the lute fell at their feet, leaving Fran\u00e7ois\nunhampered and his sword-arm free.\n\nThis was fuel to the priest's wrath. \"Sacred bones of Benoit!\" he\nsnarled; \"I could make a near guess as to what window you have been\ncaterwauling under.\"\n\nFrom beneath his gown he suddenly hauled out a rapier and struck at the\nboy while Francois was yet tugging at his sword.\n\nFull in the mouth Sermaise struck him, splitting the lower lip through.\nFrancois felt the piercing cold of the steel, the tingling of it against\nhis teeth, then the warm grateful spurt of blood; through a red mist, he\nsaw Gilles and Ysabeau run screaming down the Rue Saint Jacques.\n\nHe drew and made at Sermaise, forgetful of le Merdi. It was shrewd work.\nPresently they were fighting in the moonlight, hammer-and-tongs, as the\nsaying is, and presently Sermaise was cursing like a madman, for Fran\u00e7ois\nhad wounded him in the groin. Window after window rattled open as the Rue\nSaint Jacques ran nightcapped to peer at the brawl. Then as Francois\nhurled back his sword to slash at the priest's shaven head--Frenchmen had\nnot yet learned to thrust with the point in the Italian manner--Jehan le\nMerdi leapt from behind, nimble as a snake, and wrested away the boy's\nweapon. Sermaise closed with a glad shout.\n\n\"Heart of God!\" cried Sermaise. \"Pray, bridegroom, pray!\"\n\nBut Fran\u00e7ois jumped backward, tumbling over le Merdi, and with apish\ncelerity caught up a great stone and flung it full in the priest's\ncountenance.\n\nThe rest was hideous. For a breathing space Sermaise kept his feet, his\noutspread arms making a tottering cross. It was curious to see him peer\nabout irresolutely now that he had no face. Fran\u00e7ois, staring at the\nblack featureless horror before him, began to choke. Standing thus, with\noutstretched arms, the priest first let fall his hands, so that they hung\nlimp from the wrists; his finger-nails gleamed in the moonlight. His\nrapier tinkled on the flagstones with the sound of shattering glass, and\nPhilippe Sermaise slid down, all a-jumble, crumpling like a broken toy.\nAfterward you might have heard a long, awed sibilance go about the\nwindows overhead as the watching Rue Saint Jacques breathed again.\n\nFrancois de Montcorbier ran. He tore at his breast as he ran, stifling.\nHe wept as he ran through the moon-washed Rue Saint Jacques, making\nanimal-like and whistling noises. His split lip was a clammy dead thing\nthat napped against his chin as he ran.\n\n\"Fran\u00e7ois!\" a man cried, meeting him; \"ah, name of a name, Fran\u00e7ois!\"\n\nIt was Ren\u00e9 de Montigny, lurching from the Crowned Ox, half-tipsy. He\ncaught the boy by the shoulder and hurried Fran\u00e7ois, still sobbing, to\nFouquet the barber-surgeon's, where they sewed up his wound. In\naccordance with the police regulations, they first demanded an account of\nhow he had received it. Ren\u00e9 lied up-hill and down-dale, while in a\ncorner of the room Fran\u00e7ois monotonously wept.\n\nFate grinned and went on with her weaving.\n\n\n4. \"_Necessit\u00e9 Faict Gens Mesprende_\"\n\nThe Rue Saint Jacques had toothsome sauce for its breakfast. The quarter\nsmacked stiff lips over the news, as it pictured Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier\ndangling from Montfaucon. \"Horrible!\" said the Rue Saint Jacques, and\ndrew a moral of suitably pious flavor.\n\nGuillemette Moreau had told Catherine of the affair before the day was\naired. The girl's hurt vanity broke tether.\n\n\"Sermaise!\" said she. \"Bah, what do I care for Sermaise! He killed him in\nfair fight. But within an hour, Guillemette,--within a half-hour after\nleaving me, he is junketing on church-porches with that trollop. They\nwere not there for holy-water. Midnight, look you! And he swore to\nme--chaff, chaff! His honor is chaff, Guillemette, and his heart a\nbran-bag. Oh, swine, filthy swine! Eh, well, let the swine stick to his\nsty. Send No\u00ebl d'Arnaye to me.\"\n\nThe Sieur d'Arnaye came, his head tied in a napkin.\n\n\"Foh!\" said she; \"another swine fresh from the gutter? No, this is a\nbottle, a tun, a walking wine-barrel! No\u00ebl, I despise you. I will marry\nyou if you like.\"\n\nHe fell to mumbling her hand. An hour later Catherine told Jehan de\nVaucelles she intended to marry No\u00ebl the Handsome when he should come\nback from Geneppe with the exiled Dauphin. The old man, having wisdom,\nlifted his brows, and returned to his reading in _Le Pet au Diable_.\n\nThe patrol had transported Sermaise to the prison of Saint Benoit, where\nhe lay all night. That day he was carried to the hospital of the H\u00f4tel\nDieu. He died the following Saturday.\n\nDeath exalted the man to some nobility. Before one of the apparitors of\nthe Ch\u00e2telet he exonerated Montcorbier, under oath, and asked that no\nsteps be taken against him. \"I forgive him my death,\" said Sermaise,\nmanly enough at the last, \"by reason of certain causes moving him\nthereunto.\" Presently he demanded the peach-colored silk glove they would\nfind in the pocket of his gown. It was Catherine's glove. The priest\nkissed it, and then began to laugh. Shortly afterward he died, still\ngnawing at the glove.\n\nFran\u00e7ois and Ren\u00e9 had vanished. \"Good riddance,\" said the Rue Saint\nJacques. But Montcorbier was summoned to answer before the court of the\nCh\u00e2telet for the death of Philippe Sermaise, and in default of his\nappearance, was subsequently condemned to banishment from the kingdom.\n\nThe two young men were at Saint Pour\u00e7ain-en-Bourbonnais, where Ren\u00e9 had\nkinsmen. Under the name of des Loges, Fran\u00e7ois had there secured a place\nas tutor, but when he heard that Sermaise in the article of death had\ncleared him of all blame, Fran\u00e7ois set about procuring a pardon.\n[Footnote: There is humor in his deposition that Gilles and Ysabeau and\nhe were loitering before Saint Beno\u00eet's in friendly discourse,--\"pour soy\nesbatre.\" Perhaps Ren\u00e9 prompted this; but in itself, it is characteristic\nof Montcorbier that he trenched on perjury, blithely, in order to screen\nYsabeau.] It was January before he succeeded in obtaining it.\n\nMeanwhile he had learned a deal of Ren\u00e9's way of living. \"You are a\nthief,\" Fran\u00e7ois observed to Montigny the day the pardon came, \"but you\nhave played a kindly part by me. I think you are Dysmas, Ren\u00e9, not\nGestas. Heh, I throw no stones. You have stolen, but I have killed. Let\nus go to Paris, lad, and start afresh.\"\n\nMontigny grinned. \"I shall certainly go to Paris,\" he said. \"Friends wait\nfor me there,--Guy Tabary, Petit Jehan and Colin de Cayeux. We are\nplanning to visit Guillaume Coiffier, a fat priest with some six hundred\ncrowns in the cupboard. You will make one of the party, Fran\u00e7ois.\"\n\n\"Ren\u00e9, Ren\u00e9,\" said the other, \"my heart bleeds for you.\"\n\nAgain Montigny grinned. \"You think a great deal about blood nowadays,\" he\ncommented. \"People will be mistaking you for such a poet as was crowned\nNero, who, likewise, gave his time to ballad-making and to murdering\nfathers of the Church. Eh, dear Ahenabarbus, let us first see what the\nRue Saint Jacques has to say about your recent gambols. After that, I\nthink you will make one of our party.\"\n\n\n5. \"_Yeulx sans Piti\u00e9!_\"\n\nThere was a light crackling frost under foot the day that Fran\u00e7ois came\nback to the Rue Saint Jacques. Upon this brisk, clear January day it was\ngood to be home again, an excellent thing to be alive.\n\n\"Eh, Guillemette, Guillemette,\" he laughed. \"Why, lass--!\"\n\n\"Faugh!\" said Guillemette Moreau, as she passed him, nose in air. \"A\nmurderer, a priest-killer.\"\n\nThen the sun went black for Fran\u00e7ois. Such welcoming was a bucket of\ncold water, full in the face. He gasped, staring after her; and pursy\nThomas Tricot, on his way from mass, nudged Martin Blaru in the ribs.\n\n\"Martin,\" said he, \"fruit must be cheap this year. Yonder in the gutter\nis an apple from the gallows-tree, and no one will pick it up.\"\n\nBlaru turned and spat out, \"Cain! Judas!\"\n\nThis was only a sample. Everywhere Fran\u00e7ois found rigid faces, sniffs,\nand skirts drawn aside. A little girl in a red cap, Robin Troussecaille's\ndaughter, flung a stone at Fran\u00e7ois as he slunk into the cloister of\nSaint Benoit-le-B\u00e9tourn\u00e9. In those days a slain priest was God's servant\nslain, no less; and the Rue Saint Jacques was a respectable God-fearing\nquarter of Paris.\n\n\"My father!\" the boy cried, rapping upon the door of the H\u00f4tel de la\nPorte-Rouge; \"O my father, open to me, for I think that my heart is\nbreaking.\"\n\nShortly his foster-father, Guillaume de Villon, came to the window.\n\"Murderer!\" said he. \"Betrayer of women! Now, by the caldron of John! how\ndare you show your face here? I gave you my name and you soiled it. Back\nto your husks, rascal!\"\n\n\"O God, O God!\" Fran\u00e7ois cried, one or two times, as he looked up into\nthe old man's implacable countenance. \"You, too, my father!\"\n\nHe burst into a fit of sobbing.\n\n\"Go!\" the priest stormed; \"go, murderer!\"\n\nIt was not good to hear Fran\u00e7ois' laughter. \"What a world we live in!\"\nhe giggled. \"You gave me your name and I soiled it? Eh, Master Priest,\nMaster Pharisee, beware! _Villon_ is good French for _vagabond_, an\nexcellent name for an outcast. And as God lives, I will presently drag\nthat name through every muckheap in France.\"\n\nYet he went to Jehan de Vaucelles' home. \"I will afford God one more\nchance at my soul,\" said Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nIn the garden he met Catherine and No\u00ebl d'Arnaye coming out of the house.\nThey stopped short. Her face, half-muffled in the brown fur of her cloak,\nflushed to a wonderful rose of happiness, the great eyes glowed, and\nCatherine reached out her hands toward Fran\u00e7ois with a glad cry.\n\nHis heart was hot wax as he fell before her upon his knees. \"O heart's\ndearest, heart's dearest!\" he sobbed; \"forgive me that I doubted you!\"\n\nAnd then for an instant, the balance hung level. But after a while,\n\"Ysabeau de Montigny dwells in the Rue du Fouarre,\" said Catherine, in a\ncrisp voice,--\"having served your purpose, however, I perceive that\nYsabeau, too, is to be cast aside as though she were an old glove.\nMonsieur d'Arnaye, thrash for me this betrayer of women.\"\n\nNo\u00ebl was a big, handsome man, like an obtuse demi-god, a foot taller\nthan Fran\u00e7ois. Noel lifted the boy by his collar, caught up a stick and\nset to work. Catherine watched them, her eyes gemlike and cruel.\n\nFran\u00e7ois did not move a muscle. God had chosen.\n\nAfter a little, though, the Sieur d'Arnaye flung Fran\u00e7ois upon the\nground, where he lay quite still for a moment. Then slowly he rose\nto his feet. He never looked at No\u00ebl. For a long time Francois\nstared at Catherine de Vaucelles, frost-flushed, defiant, incredibly\nbeautiful. Afterward the boy went out of the garden, staggering like\na drunken person.\n\nHe found Montigny at the Crowned Ox. \"Ren\u00e9,\" said Fran\u00e7ois, \"there is no\ncharity on earth, there is no God in Heaven. But in Hell there is most\nassuredly a devil, and I think that he must laugh a great deal. What was\nthat you were telling me about the priest with six hundred crowns in his\ncupboard?\"\n\nRen\u00e9 slapped him on the shoulder. \"Now,\" said he, \"you talk like a man.\"\nHe opened the door at the back and cried: \"Colin, you and Petit Jehan and\nthat pig Tabary may come out. I have the honor, messieurs, to offer you a\nnew Companion of the Cockleshell--Master Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier.\"\n\nBut the recruit raised a protesting hand. \"No,\" said he,--\"Fran\u00e7ois\nVillon. The name is triply indisputable, since it has been put upon me\nnot by one priest but by three.\"\n\n\n6. _\"Volia l'Estat Divers d'entre Eulx\"_\n\nWhen the Dauphin came from Geneppe to be crowned King of France, there\nrode with him No\u00ebl d'Arnaye and No\u00ebl's brother Raymond. And the\nlongawaited news that Charles the Well-Served was at last servitor to\nDeath, brought the exiled Louis post-haste to Paris, where the Rue Saint\nJacques turned out full force to witness his triumphal entry. They\nexpected, in those days, Saturnian doings of Louis XI, a recrudescence of\nthe Golden Age; and when the new king began his reign by granting No\u00ebl a\nsnug fief in Picardy, the Rue Saint Jacques applauded.\n\n\"No\u00ebl has followed the King's fortunes these ten years,\" said the Rue\nSaint Jacques; \"it is only just. And now, neighbor, we may look to see\nNoel the Handsome and Catherine de Vaucelles make a match of it. The\ngirl has a tidy dowry, they say; old Jehan proved wealthier than the\nquarter suspected. But death of my life, yes! You may see his tomb in\nthe Innocents' yonder, with weeping seraphim and a yard of Latin on it.\nI warrant you that rascal Montcorbier has lain awake in half the prisons\nin France thinking of what he flung away. Seven years, no less, since he\nand Montigny showed their thieves' faces here. La, the world wags,\nneighbor, and they say there will be a new tax on salt if we go to war\nwith the English.\"\n\nNot quite thus, perhaps, ran the meditations of Catherine de Vaucelles\none still August night as she sat at her window, overlooking the acacias\nand chestnuts of her garden. No\u00ebl, conspicuously prosperous in blue and\nsilver, had but now gone down the Rue Saint Jacques, singing, clinking\nthe fat purse whose plumpness was still a novelty. That evening she had\ngiven her promise to marry him at Michaelmas.\n\nThis was a black night, moonless, windless. There were a scant half-dozen\nstars overhead, and the thick scent of roses and mignonette came up to\nher in languid waves. Below, the tree-tops conferred, stealthily, and the\nfountain plashed its eternal remonstrance against the conspiracy they\nlisped of.\n\nAfter a while Catherine rose and stood contemplative before a long mirror\nthat was in her room. Catherine de Vaucelles was now, at twenty-three, in\nthe full flower of her comeliness. Blue eyes the mirror showed\nher,--luminous and tranquil eyes, set very far apart; honey-colored hair\nmassed heavily about her face, a mouth all curves, the hue of a\nstrawberry, tender but rather fretful, and beneath it a firm chin; only\nher nose left something to be desired,--for that feature, though\nwell-formed, was diminutive and bent toward the left, by perhaps the\nthickness of a cobweb. She might reasonably have smiled at what the\nmirror showed her, but, for all that, she sighed.\n\n\"O Beauty of her, whereby I am undone,\" said Catherine, wistfully. \"Ah,\nGod in Heaven, forgive me for my folly! Sweet Christ, intercede for me\nwho have paid dearly for my folly!\"\n\nFate grinned in her weaving. Through the open window came the sound of a\nvoice singing.\n\nSang the voice:\n\n  _\"O Beauty of her, whereby I am undone!\n  O Grace of her, that hath no grace for me!\n  O Love of her, the bit that guides me on\n  To sorrow and to grievous misery!\n  O felon Charms, my poor heart's enemy--\"_\n\nand the singing broke off in a fit of coughing.\n\nCatherine had remained motionless for a matter of two minutes, her head\npoised alertly. She went to the gong and struck it seven or eight times.\n\n\"Mac\u00e9e, there is a man in the garden. Bring him to me, Mac\u00e9e,--ah, love\nof God, Mac\u00e9e, make haste!\"\n\nBlinking, he stood upon the threshold. Then, without words, their lips\nmet.\n\n\"My king!\" said Catherine; \"heart's emperor!\"\n\n\"O rose of all the world!\" he cried.\n\nThere was at first no need of speech.\n\nBut after a moment she drew away and stared at him. Fran\u00e7ois, though he\nwas but thirty, seemed an old man. His bald head shone in the\ncandle-light. His face was a mesh of tiny wrinkles, wax-white, and his\nlower lip, puckered by the scar of his wound, protruded in an eternal\ngrimace. As Catherine steadfastly regarded him, the faded eyes,\nhalf-covered with a bluish film, shifted, and with a jerk he glanced over\nhis shoulder. The movement started a cough tearing at his throat.\n\n\"Holy Macaire!\" said he. \"I thought that somebody, if not Henri Cousin,\nthe executioner, was at my heels. Why do you stare so, lass? Have you\nanything to eat? I am famished.\"\n\nIn silence she brought him meat and wine, and he fell upon it. He ate\nhastily, chewing with his front teeth, like a sheep.\n\nWhen he had ended, Catherine came to him and took both his hands in hers\nand lifted them to her lips. \"The years have changed you, Fran\u00e7ois,\" she\nsaid, curiously meek.\n\nFran\u00e7ois put her away. Then he strode to the mirror and regarded it\nintently. With a snarl, he turned about. \"The years!\" said he. \"You are\nmodest. It was you who killed Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier, as surely as\nMontcorbier killed Sermaise. Eh, Sovereign Virgin! that is scant cause\nfor grief. You made Fran\u00e7ois Villon. What do you think of him, lass?\"\n\nShe echoed the name. It was in many ways a seasoned name, but\nunaccustomed to mean nothing. Accordingly Fran\u00e7ois sneered.\n\n\"Now, by all the fourteen joys and sorrows of Our Lady! I believe that\nyou have never heard of Fran\u00e7ois Villon! The Rue Saint Jacques has not\nheard of Fran\u00e7ois Villon! The pigs, the gross pigs, that dare not peep\nout of their sty! Why, I have capped verses with the Duke of Orleans. The\nvery street-boys know my Ballad of the Women of Paris. Not a drunkard in\nthe realm but has ranted my jolly Orison for Master Cotard's Soul when\nthe bottle passed. The King himself hauled me out of Meung gaol last\nSeptember, swearing that in all France there was not my equal at a\nballad. And you have never heard of me!\"\n\nOnce more a fit of coughing choked him mid-course in his indignant\nchattering.\n\nShe gave him a woman's answer: \"I do not care if you are the greatest\nlord in the kingdom or the most sunken knave that steals ducks from Paris\nMoat. I only know that I love you, Fran\u00e7ois.\"\n\nFor a long time he kept silence, blinking, peering quizzically at her\nlifted face. She did love him; no questioning that. But presently he\nagain put her aside, and went toward the open window. This was a matter\nfor consideration.\n\nThe night was black as a pocket. Staring into it, Fran\u00e7ois threw back his\nhead and drew a deep, tremulous breath. The rising odor of roses and\nmignonette, keen and intolerably sweet, had roused unforgotten pulses in\nhis blood, had set shame and joy adrum in his breast.\n\nThe woman loved him! Through these years, with a woman's unreasoning\nfidelity, she had loved him. He knew well enough how matters stood\nbetween her and Noel d'Arnaye; the host of the Crowned Ox had been\ngarrulous that evening. But it was Fran\u00e7ois whom she loved. She was\nwell-to-do. Here for the asking was a competence, love, an ingleside of\nhis own. The deuce of it was that Francois feared to ask.\n\n\"--Because I am still past reason in all that touches this ignorant,\nhot-headed, Pharisaical, rather stupid wench! That is droll. But love is\na resistless tyrant, and, Mother of God! has there been in my life a day,\nan hour, a moment when I have not loved her! To see her once was all that\nI had craved,--as a lost soul might covet, ere the Pit take him, one\nsplendid glimpse of Heaven and the Nine Blessed Orders at their fiddling.\nAnd I find that she loves me--me! Fate must have her jest, I perceive,\nthough the firmament crack for it. She would have been content enough\nwith Noel, thinking me dead. And with me?\" Contemplatively he spat out of\nthe window. \"Eh, if I dared hope that this last flicker of life left in\nmy crazy carcass might burn clear! I have but a little while to live; if\nI dared hope to live that little cleanly! But the next cup of wine, the\nnext light woman?--I have answered more difficult riddles. Choose, then,\nFran\u00e7ois Villon,--choose between the squalid, foul life yonder and her\nwell-being. It is true that starvation is unpleasant and that hanging is\nreported to be even less agreeable. But just now these considerations are\nirrelevant.\"\n\nStaring into the darkness he fought the battle out. Squarely he faced the\nissue; for that instant he saw Fran\u00e7ois Villon as the last seven years\nhad made him, saw the wine-sodden soul of Fran\u00e7ois Villon, rotten and\nweak and honeycombed with vice. Moments of nobility it had; momentarily,\nas now, it might be roused to finer issues; but Fran\u00e7ois knew that no\npower existent could hearten it daily to curb the brutish passions. It\nwas no longer possible for Fran\u00e7ois Villon to live cleanly. \"For what am\nI?--a hog with a voice. And shall I hazard her life's happiness to get me\na more comfortable sty? Ah, but the deuce of it is that I so badly need\nthat sty!\"\n\nHe turned with a quick gesture.\n\n\"Listen,\" Fran\u00e7ois said. \"Yonder is Paris,--laughing, tragic Paris, who\nonce had need of a singer to proclaim her splendor and all her misery.\nFate made the man; in necessity's mortar she pounded his soul into the\nshape Fate needed. To king's courts she lifted him; to thieves' hovels\nshe thrust him down; and past Lutetia's palaces and abbeys and taverns\nand lupanars and gutters and prisons and its very gallows--past each in\nturn the man was dragged, that he might make the Song of Paris. He could\nnot have made it here in the smug Rue Saint Jacques. Well! the song is\nmade, Catherine. So long as Paris endures, Fran\u00e7ois Villon will be\nremembered. Villon the singer Fate fashioned as was needful: and, in this\nfashioning, Villon the man was damned in body and soul. And by God! the\nsong was worth it!\"\n\nShe gave a startled cry and came to him, her hands fluttering toward his\nbreast. \"Fran\u00e7ois!\" she breathed.\n\nIt would not be good to kill the love in her face.\n\n\"You loved Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier. Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier is dead. The\nPharisees of the Rue Saint Jacques killed him seven years ago, and that\nday Fran\u00e7ois Villon was born. That was the name I swore to drag through\nevery muckheap in France. And I have done it, Catherine. The Companions\nof the Cockleshell--eh, well, the world knows us. We robbed Guillamme\nCoiffier, we robbed the College of Navarre, we robbed the Church of Saint\nMaturin,--I abridge the list of our gambols. Now we harvest. Ren\u00e9 de\nMontigny's bones swing in the wind yonder at Montfaucon. Colin de Cayeux\nthey broke on the wheel. The rest--in effect, I am the only one that\njustice spared,--because I had diverting gifts at rhyming, they said.\nPah! if they only knew! I am immortal, lass. _Exegi monumentum_. Villon's\nglory and Villon's shame will never die.\"\n\nHe flung back his bald head and laughed now, tittering over that\ncalamitous, shabby secret between all-seeing God and Fran\u00e7ois Villon. She\nhad drawn a little away from him. This well-reared girl saw him exultant\nin infamy, steeped to the eyes in infamy. But still the nearness of her,\nthe faint perfume of her, shook in his veins, and still he must play the\nmiserable comedy to the end, since the prize he played for was to him\npeculiarly desirable.\n\n\"A thief--a common thief!\" But again her hands fluttered back. \"I drove\nyou to it. Mine is the shame.\"\n\n\"Holy Macaire! what is a theft or two? Hunger that causes the wolf to\nsally from the wood, may well make a man do worse than steal. I could\ntell you--For example, you might ask in Hell of one Thevenin Pensete, who\nknifed him in the cemetery of Saint John.\"\n\nHe hinted a lie, for it was Montigny who killed Thevenin Pensete. Villon\nplayed without scruple now.\n\nCatherine's face was white. \"Stop,\" she pleaded; \"no more, Fran\u00e7ois,--ah,\nHoly Virgin! do not tell me any more.\"\n\nBut after a little she came to him, touching him almost as if with\nunwillingness. \"Mine is the shame. It was my jealousy, my vanity,\nFran\u00e7ois, that thrust you back into temptation. And we are told by those\nin holy orders that the compassion of God is infinite. If you still care\nfor me, I will be your wife.\"\n\nYet she shuddered.\n\nHe saw it. His face, too, was paper, and Fran\u00e7ois laughed horribly.\n\n\"If I still love you! Go, ask of Denise, of Jacqueline, or of Pierrette,\nof Marion the Statue, of Jehanne of Brittany, of Blanche Slippermaker, of\nFat Peg,--ask of any trollop in all Paris how Fran\u00e7ois Villon loves. You\nthought me faithful! You thought that I especially preferred you to any\nother bed-fellow! Eh, I perceive that the credo of the Rue Saint Jacques\nis somewhat narrow-minded. For my part I find one woman much the same as\nanother.\" And his voice shook, for he saw how pretty she was, saw how she\nsuffered. But he managed a laugh.\n\n\"I do not believe you,\" Catherine said, in muffled tones. \"Fran\u00e7ois! You\nloved me, Fran\u00e7ois. Ah, boy, boy!\" she cried, with a pitiable wail; \"come\nback to me, boy that I loved!\"\n\nIt was a difficult business. But he grinned in her face.\n\n\"He is dead. Let Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier rest in his grave. Your voice is\nvery sweet, Catherine, and--and he could refuse you nothing, could he,\nlass? Ah, God, God, God!\" he cried, in his agony; \"why can you not\nbelieve me? I tell you Necessity pounds us in her mortar to what shape\nshe will. I tell you that Montcorbier loved you, but Fran\u00e7ois Villon\nprefers Fat Peg. An ill cat seeks an ill rat.\" And with this,\ntranquillity fell upon his soul, for he knew that he had won.\n\nHer face told him that. Loathing was what he saw there.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" Catherine said, dully. \"I am sorry. Oh, for high God's\nsake! go, go! Do you want money? I will give you anything if you will\nonly go. Oh, beast! Oh, swine, swine, swine!\"\n\nHe turned and went, staggering like a drunken person.\n\nOnce in the garden he fell prone upon his face in the wet grass. About\nhim the mingled odor of roses and mignonette was sweet and heavy; the\nfountain plashed interminably in the night, and above him the chestnuts\nand acacias rustled and lisped as they had done seven years ago. Only he\nwas changed.\n\n\"O Mother of God,\" the thief prayed, \"grant that No\u00ebl may be kind to\nher! Mother of God, grant that she may be happy! Mother of God, grant\nthat I may not live long!\"\n\nAnd straightway he perceived that triple invocation could be, rather\nneatly, worked out in ballade form. Yes, with a separate prayer to each\nverse. So, dismissing for the while his misery, he fell to considering,\nwith undried cheeks, what rhymes he needed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJULY 17, 1484\n\n\"_Et puis il se rencontre icy une avanture merveilleuse, c'est que le\nfils de Grand Turc ressemble \u00e0 Cl\u00e9onte, \u00e0 peu de chose pr\u00e9s_.\"\n\n\n_No\u00ebl d'Arnaye and Catherine de Vaucelles were married in the September\nof 1462, and afterward withdrew to No\u00ebl's fief in Picardy. There No\u00ebl\nbuilt him a new Chateau d'Arnaye, and through the influence of Nicole\nBeaupertuys, the King's mistress, (who was rumored in court by-ways to\nhave a tenderness for the handsome No\u00ebl), obtained large grants for its\nmaintenance. Madame d'Arnaye, also, it is gratifying to record, appears\nto have lived in tolerable amity with Sieur No\u00ebl, and neither of them\npried too closely into the other's friendships.\n\nCatherine died in 1470, and No\u00ebl outlived her but by three years. Of the\nsix acknowledged children surviving him, only one was legitimate--a\ndaughter called Matthiette. The estate and title thus reverted to Raymond\nd'Arnaye, No\u00ebl's younger brother, from whom the present family of Arnaye\nis descended.\n\nRaymond was a far shrewder man than his predecessor. For ten years'\nspace, while Louis XI, that royal fox of France, was destroying feudalism\npiecemeal,--trimming its power day by day as you might pare an\nonion,--the new Sieur d'Arnaye steered his shifty course between France\nand Burgundy, always to the betterment of his chances in this world\nhowever he may have modified them in the next. At Arras he fought beneath\nthe orifiamme; at Guinegate you could not have found a more staunch\nBurgundian: though he was no warrior, victory followed him like a\nlap-dog. So that presently the Sieur d'Arnaye and the Vicomte de\nPuysange--with which family we have previously concerned ourselves--were\nthe great lords of Northern France.\n\nBut after the old King's death came gusty times for Sieur Raymond. It is\nwith them we have here to do_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The Episode Called The Conspiracy of Arnaye_\n\n\n1. _Policy Tempered with Singing_\n\n\"And so,\" said the Sieur d'Arnaye, as he laid down the letter, \"we may\nlook for the coming of Monsieur de Puysange to-morrow.\"\n\nThe Demoiselle Matthiette contorted her features in an expression of\ndisapproval. \"So soon!\" said she. \"I had thought--\"\n\n\"Ouais, my dear niece, Love rides by ordinary with a dripping spur, and\nis still as arbitrary as in the day when Mars was taken with a net and\namorous Jove bellowed in Europa's kail-yard. My faith! if Love distemper\nthus the spectral ichor of the gods, is it remarkable that the warmer\nblood of man pulses rather vehemently at his bidding? It were the least\nof Cupid's miracles that a lusty bridegroom of some twenty-and-odd should\nbe pricked to outstrip the dial by a scant week. For love--I might tell\nyou such tales--\"\n\nSieur Raymond crossed his white, dimpled hands over a well-rounded\npaunch and chuckled reminiscently; had he spoken doubtless he would have\nleft Master Jehan de Troyes very little to reveal in his Scandalous\nChronicle: but now, as if now recalling with whom Sieur Raymond\nconversed, d'Arnaye's lean face assumed an expression of placid sanctity,\nand the somewhat unholy flame died out of his green eyes. He was like no\nother thing than a plethoric cat purring over the follies of kittenhood.\nYou would have taken oath that a cultured taste for good living was the\nchief of his offences, and that this benevolent gentleman had some sixty\nwell-spent years to his credit. True, his late Majesty, King Louis XI,\nhad sworn Pacque Dieu! that d'Arnaye loved underhanded work so heartily\nthat he conspired with his gardener concerning the planting of cabbages,\nand within a week after his death would be heading some treachery against\nLucifer; but kings are not always infallible, as his Majesty himself had\nproven at Peronne.\n\n\"--For,\" said the Sieur d'Arnaye, \"man's flesh is frail, and the devil is\nvery cunning to avail himself of the weaknesses of lovers.\"\n\n\"Love!\" Matthiette cried. \"Ah, do not mock me, my uncle! There can be no\npretence of love between Monsieur de Puysange and me. A man that I have\nnever seen, that is to wed me of pure policy, may look for no Alcestis in\nhis wife.\"\n\n\"You speak like a very sensible girl,\" said Sieur Raymond, complacently.\n\"However, so that he find her no Guinevere or Semiramis or other\nloose-minded trollop of history, I dare say Monsieur de Puysange will\nhold to his bargain with indifferent content. Look you, niece, he, also,\nis buying--though the saying is somewhat rustic--a pig in a poke.\"\n\nMatthiette glanced quickly toward the mirror which hung in her apartment.\nThe glass reflected features which went to make up a beauty already\nbe-sonneted in that part of France; and if her green gown was some months\nbehind the last Italian fashion, it undeniably clad one who needed few\nadventitious aids. The Demoiselle Matthiette at seventeen was very tall,\nand was as yet too slender for perfection of form, but her honey-colored\nhair hung heavily about the unblemished oval of a countenance whose nose\nalone left something to be desired; for this feature, though well shaped,\nwas unduly diminutive. For the rest, her mouth curved in an\nirreproachable bow, her complexion was mingled milk and roses, her blue\neyes brooded in a provoking calm; taking matters by and large, the smile\nthat followed her inspection of the mirror's depths was far from\nunwarranted. Catherine de Vaucelles reanimate, you would have sworn; and\nat the abbey of Saint Maixent-en-Poitou there was a pot-belly monk, a\nBrother Fran\u00e7ois, who would have demonstrated it to you, in an\nunanswerable ballad, that Catherine's daughter was in consequence all\nthat an empress should be and so rarely is. Harembourges and Bertha\nBroadfoot and white Queen Blanche would have been laughed to scorn,\ndemolished and proven, in comparison (with a catalogue of very intimate\npersonal detail), the squalidest sluts conceivable, by Brother Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nBut Sieur Raymond merely chuckled wheezily, as one discovering a fault in\nhis companion of which he disapproves in theory, but in practice finds\nflattering to his vanity.\n\n\"I grant you, Monsieur de Puysange drives a good bargain,\" said Sieur\nRaymond. \"Were Cleopatra thus featured, the Roman lost the world very\nworthily. Yet, such is the fantastic disposition of man that I do not\ndoubt the vicomte looks forward to the joys of to-morrow no whit more\ncheerfully than you do: for the lad is young, and, as rumor says, has\nbeen guilty of divers verses,--ay, he has bearded common-sense in the\nvext periods of many a wailing rhyme. I will wager a moderate amount,\nhowever, that the vicomte, like a sensible young man, keeps these\nwhimsies of flames and dames laid away in lavender for festivals and the\nlike; they are somewhat too fine for everyday wear.\"\n\nSieur Raymond sipped the sugared wine which stood beside him. \"Like\nany sensible young man,\" he repeated, in a meditative fashion that was\nhalf a query.\n\nMatthiette stirred uneasily. \"Is love, then, nothing?\" she murmured.\n\n\"Love!\" Sieur Raymond barked like a kicked mastiff. \"It is very\ndiscreetly fabled that love was brought forth at Cythera by the ocean\nfogs. Thus, look you, even ballad-mongers admit it comes of a\nshort-lived family, that fade as time wears on. I may have a passion for\ncloud-tatters, and, doubtless, the morning mists are beautiful; but if I\ngive rein to my admiration, breakfast is likely to grow cold. I deduce\nthat beauty, as represented by the sunrise, is less profitably considered\nthan utility, as personified by the frying-pan. And love! A niece of mine\nprating of love!\" The idea of such an occurrence, combined with a fit of\ncoughing which now came upon him, drew tears to the Sieur d'Arnaye's\neyes. \"Pardon me,\" said he, when he had recovered his breath, \"if I speak\nsomewhat brutally to maiden ears.\"\n\nMatthiette sighed. \"Indeed,\" said she, \"you have spoken very brutally!\"\nShe rose from her seat, and went to the Sieur d'Arnaye. \"Dear uncle,\"\nsaid she, with her arms about his neck, and with her soft cheek brushing\nhis withered countenance, \"are you come to my apartments to-night to tell\nme that love is nothing--you who have shown me that even the roughest,\nmost grizzled bear in all the world has a heart compact of love and\ntender as a woman's?\"\n\nThe Sieur d'Arnaye snorted. \"Her mother all over again!\" he complained;\nand then, recovering himself, shook his head with a hint of sadness.\n\nHe said: \"I have sighed to every eyebrow at court, and I tell you this\nmoonshine is--moonshine pure and simple. Matthiette, I love you too\ndearly to deceive you in, at all events, this matter, and I have learned\nby hard knocks that we of gentle quality may not lightly follow our own\ninclinations. Happiness is a luxury which the great can very rarely\nafford. Granted that you have an aversion to this marriage. Yet consider\nthis: Arnaye and Puysange united may sit snug and let the world wag;\notherwise, lying here between the Breton and the Austrian, we are so many\nnuts in a door-crack, at the next wind's mercy. And yonder in the South,\nOrl\u00e9ans and Dunois are raising every devil in Hell's register! Ah, no, ma\nmie; I put it to you fairly is it of greater import that a girl have her\ncallow heart's desire than that a province go free of Monsieur War and\nMadame Rapine?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\" said Matthiette.\n\nSieur Raymond struck his hand upon the table with considerable heat.\n\"Everywhere Death yawps at the frontier; will you, a d'Arnaye, bid him\nenter and surfeit? An alliance with Puysange alone may save us. Eheu, it\nis, doubtless, pitiful that a maid may not wait and wed her chosen\npaladin, but our vassals demand these sacrifices. For example, do you\nthink I wedded my late wife in any fervor of adoration? I had never seen\nher before our marriage day; yet we lived much as most couples do for\nsome ten years afterward, thereby demonstrating--\"\n\nHe smiled, evilly; Matthiette sighed.\n\n\"--Well, thereby demonstrating nothing new,\" said Sieur Raymond. \"So do\nyou remember that Pierre must have his bread and cheese; that the cows\nmust calve undisturbed; that the pigs--you have not seen the sow I had\nto-day from Harfleur?--black as ebony and a snout like a rose-leaf!--must\nbe stied in comfort: and that these things may not be, without an\nalliance with Puysange. Besides, dear niece, it is something to be the\nwife of a great lord.\"\n\nA certain excitement awoke in Matthiette's eyes. \"It must be very\nbeautiful at Court,\" said she, softly. \"Masques, f\u00eates, tourneys every\nday;--and they say the new King is exceedingly gallant--\"\n\nSieur Raymond caught her by the chin, and for a moment turned her\nface toward his. \"I warn you,\" said he, \"you are a d'Arnaye; and\nKing or not--\"\n\nHe paused here. Through the open window came the voice of one singing to\nthe demure accompaniment of a lute.\n\n\"Hey?\" said the Sieur d'Arnaye.\n\nSang the voice:\n\n  \"_When you are very old, and I am gone,\n  Not to return, it may be you will say--\n  Hearing my name and holding me as one\n  Long dead to you,--in some half-jesting way\n  Of speech, sweet as vague heraldings of May\n  Rumored in woods when first the throstles sing--\n  'He loved me once.' And straightway murmuring\n  My half-forgotten rhymes, you will regret\n  Evanished times when I was wont to sing\n  So very lightly, 'Love runs into debt.'_\"\n\n\"Now, may I never sit among the saints,\" said the Sieur d'Arnaye, \"if\nthat is not the voice of Raoul de Prison, my new page.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" Matthiette whispered. \"He woos my maid, Alys. He often sings\nunder the window, and I wink at it.\"\n\nSang the voice:\n\n  _\"I shall not heed you then. My course being run\n  For good or ill, I shall have gone my way,\n  And know you, love, no longer,--nor the sun,\n  Perchance, nor any light of earthly day,\n  Nor any joy nor sorrow,--while at play\n  The world speeds merrily, nor reckoning\n  Our coming or our going. Lips will cling,\n  Forswear, and be forsaken, and men forget\n  Where once our tombs were, and our children sing--\n  So very lightly!--'Love runs into debt.'\n\n  \"If in the grave love have dominion\n  Will that wild cry not quicken the wise clay,\n  And taunt with memories of fond deeds undone,--\n  Some joy untasted, some lost holiday,--\n  All death's large wisdom? Will that wisdom lay\n  The ghost of any sweet familiar thing\n  Come haggard from the Past, or ever bring\n  Forgetfulness of those two lovers met\n  When all was April?--nor too wise to sing\n  So very lightly, 'Love runs into debt.'\n\n  \"Yet, Matthiette, though vain remembering\n  Draw nigh, and age be drear, yet in the spring\n  We meet and kiss, whatever hour beset\n  Wherein all hours attain to harvesting,--\n  So very lightly love runs into debt.\"_\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said the Sieur d'Arnaye. \"You mentioned your maid's\nname, I think?\"\n\n\"Alys,\" said Matthiette, with unwonted humbleness.\n\nSieur Raymond spread out his hands in a gesture of commiseration. \"This\nis very remarkable,\" he said. \"Beyond doubt, the gallant beneath has made\nsome unfortunate error. Captain Gotiard,\" he called, loudly, \"will you\nascertain who it is that warbles in the garden such queer aliases for our\ngood Alys?\"\n\n\n2. _Age Glosses the Text of Youth_\n\nGotiard was not long in returning; he was followed by two men-at-arms,\nwho held between them the discomfited minstrel. Envy alone could have\ndescribed the lutanist as ill-favored; his close-fitting garb, wherein\nthe brave reds of autumn were judiciously mingled, at once set off a\nwell-knit form and enhanced the dark comeliness of features less French\nthan Italian in cast. The young man now stood silent, his eyes mutely\nquestioning the Sieur d'Arnaye.\n\n\"Oh, la, la, la!\" chirped Sieur Raymond. \"Captain, I think you are at\nliberty to retire.\" He sipped his wine meditatively, as the men filed\nout. \"Monsieur de Frison,\" d'Arnaye resumed, when the arras had fallen,\n\"believe me, I grieve to interrupt your very moving and most excellently\nphrased ballad in this fashion. But the hour is somewhat late for melody,\nand the curiosity of old age is privileged. May one inquire, therefore,\nwhy you outsing my larks and linnets and other musical poultry that are\nnow all abed? and warble them to rest with this pleasing but--if I may\nventure a suggestion--rather ill-timed madrigal?\"\n\nThe young man hesitated for an instant before replying. \"Sir,\" said he,\nat length, \"I confess that had I known of your whereabouts, the birds had\ngone without their lullaby. But you so rarely come to this wing of the\nchateau, that your presence here to-night is naturally unforeseen. As it\nis, since chance has betrayed my secret to you, I must make bold to\nacknowledge it; and to confess that I love your niece.\"\n\n\"Hey, no doubt you do,\" Sieur Raymond assented, pleasantly. \"Indeed, I\nthink half the young men hereabout are in much the same predicament. But,\nmy question, if I mistake not, related to your reason for chaunting\ncanzonets beneath her window.\"\n\nRaoul de Frison stared at him in amazement. \"I love her,\" he said.\n\n\"You mentioned that before,\" Sieur Raymond suggested. \"And I agreed, as I\nremember, that it was more than probable; for my niece here--though it be\nI that speak it--is by no means uncomely, has a commendable voice, the\nwalk of a Hebe, and sufficient wit to deceive her lover into happiness.\nMy faith, young man, you show excellent taste! But, I submit, the purest\naffection is an insufficient excuse for outbaying a whole kennel of\nhounds beneath the adored one's casement.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Raoul, \"I believe that lovers have rarely been remarkable for\nsanity; and it is an immemorial custom among them to praise the object of\ntheir desires with fitting rhymes. Conceive, sir, that in your youth, had\nyou been accorded the love of so fair a lady, you yourself had scarcely\ndone otherwise. For I doubt if your blood runs so thin as yet that you\nhave quite forgot young Raymond d'Arnaye and the gracious ladies whom he\nloved,--I think that your heart must needs yet treasure the memories of\ndivers moonlit nights, even such as this, when there was a great silence\nin the world, and the nested trees were astir with desire of the dawn,\nand your waking dreams were vext with the singular favor of some woman's\nface. It is in the name of that young Raymond I now appeal to you.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said the Sieur d'Arnaye. \"As I understand it, you appeal on the\nground that you were coerced by the moonlight and led astray by the\nbird-nests in my poplar-trees; and you desire me to punish your\naccomplices rather than you.\"\n\n\"Sir,--\" said Raoul.\n\nSieur Raymond snarled. \"You young dog, you know that in the most prosaic\nbreast a minor poet survives his entombment,--and you endeavor to make\ncapital of the knowledge. You know that I have a most sincere affection\nfor your father, and have even contracted since you came to Arnaye more\nor less tolerance for you,--which emboldens you, my friend, to keep me\nout of a comfortable bed at this hour of the night with an idiotic\ndiscourse of moonlight and dissatisfied shrubbery! As it happens, I am\nnot a lank wench in her first country dance. Remember that, Raoul de\nFrison, and praise the good God who gave me at birth a very placable\ndisposition! There is not a seigneur in all France, save me, but would\nhang you at the crack of that same dawn for which you report your\nlackadaisical trees to be whining; but the quarrel will soon be Monsieur\nde Puysange's, and I prefer that he settle it at his own discretion. I\ncontent myself with advising you to pester my niece no more.\"\n\nRaoul spoke boldly. \"She loves me,\" said he, standing very erect.\n\nSieur Raymond glanced at Matthiette, who sat with downcast head. \"H'm!\"\nsaid he. \"She moderates her transports indifferently well. Though, again,\nwhy not? You are not an ill-looking lad. Indeed, Monsieur de Frison, I am\nquite ready to admit that my niece is breaking her heart for you. The\npoint on which I wish to dwell is that she weds Monsieur de Puysange\nearly to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Uncle,\" Matthiette cried, as she started to her feet, \"such a marriage\nis a crime! I love Raoul!\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" purred Sieur Raymond, \"you love the lad unboundedly,\nmadly, distractedly! Now we come to the root of the matter.\" He sank back\nin his chair and smiled. \"Young people,\" said he, \"be seated, and hearken\nto the words of wisdom. Love is a divine insanity, in which the sufferer\nfancies the world mad. And the world is made up of madmen who condemn and\npunish one another.\"\n\n\"But,\" Matthiette dissented, \"ours is no ordinary case!\"\n\n\"Surely not,\" Sieur Raymond readily agreed; \"for there was never an\nordinary case in all the history of the universe. Oh, but I, too, have\nknown this madness; I, too, have perceived how infinitely my own\nskirmishes with the blind bow-god differed in every respect from all that\nhas been or will ever be. It is an infallible sign of this frenzy.\nSurely, I have said, the world will not willingly forget the vision of\nChloris in her wedding garments, or the wonder of her last clinging kiss.\nOr, say Phyllis comes to-morrow: will an uninventive sun dare to rise in\nthe old, hackneyed fashion on such a day of days? Perish the thought!\nThere will probably be six suns, and, I dare say, a meteor or two.\"\n\n\"I perceive, sir,\" Raoul said here, \"that after all you have not\nforgotten the young Raymond of whom I spoke.\"\n\n\"That was a long while ago,\" snapped Sieur Raymond. \"I know a deal more\nof the world nowadays; and a level-headed world would be somewhat\nsurprised at such occurrences, and suggest that for the future Phyllis\nremain at home. For whether you--or I--or any one--be in love or no is to\nour fellow creatures an affair of astonishingly trivial import. Not since\nNo\u00e9 that great admiral, repeopled the world by begetting three sons upon\nDame Noria has there been a love-business worthy of consideration; nor,\nif you come to that, not since sagacious Solomon went a-wenching has a\nwise man wasted his wisdom on a lover. So love one another, my children,\nby all means: but do you, Matthiette, make ready to depart into Normandy\nas a true and faithful wife to Monsieur de Puysange; and do you, Raoul de\nPrison, remain at Arnaye, and attend to my falcons more carefully than\nyou have done of late,--or, by the cross of Saint Lo! I will clap the\nwench in a convent and hang the lad as high as Haman!\"\n\nWhereon Sieur Raymond smiled pleasantly, and drained his wine-cup as one\nconsidering the discussion ended.\n\nRaoul sat silent for a moment. Then he rose. \"Monsieur d'Arnaye, you know\nme to be a gentleman of unblemished descent, and as such entitled to a\nhearing. I forbid you before all-seeing Heaven to wed your niece to a man\nshe does not love! And I have the honor to request of you her hand in\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"Which offer I decline,\" said Sieur Raymond, grinning placidly,--\"with\nevery imaginable civility. Niece,\" he continued, \"here is a gentleman who\noffers you a heartful of love, six months of insanity, and forty years\nof boredom in a leaky, wind-swept ch\u00e2teau. He has dreamed dreams\nconcerning you: allow me to present to you the reality.\"\n\nWith some ceremony Sieur Raymond now grasped Matthiette's hand and led\nher mirror-ward. \"Permit me to present the wife of Monsieur de Puysange.\nCould he have made a worthier choice? Ah, happy lord, that shall so soon\nembrace such perfect loveliness! For, frankly, my niece, is not that\ngolden hair of a shade that will set off a coronet extraordinarily well?\nAre those wondrous eyes not fashioned to surfeit themselves upon the\nhomage and respect accorded the wife of a great lord? Ouais, the thing is\nindisputable: and, therefore, I must differ from Monsieur de Frison here,\nwho would condemn this perfection to bloom and bud unnoticed in a paltry\ncountry town.\"\n\nThere was an interval, during which Matthiette gazed sadly into the\nmirror. \"And Arnaye--?\" said she.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Sieur Raymond,--\"Arnaye must perish unless Puysange\nprove her friend. Therefore, my niece conquers her natural aversion to a\nyoung and wealthy husband, and a life of comfort and flattery and gayety;\nrelinquishes you, Raoul; and, like a feminine Mettius Curtius, sacrifices\nherself to her country's welfare. Pierre may sleep undisturbed; and the\npigs will have a new sty. My faith, it is quite affecting! And so,\" Sieur\nRaymond summed it up, \"you two young fools may bid adieu, once for all,\nwhile I contemplate this tapestry.\" He strolled to the end of the room\nand turned his back. \"Admirable!\" said he; \"really now, that leopard is\nastonishingly lifelike!\"\n\nRaoul came toward Matthiette. \"Dear love,\" said he, \"you have chosen\nwisely, and I bow to your decision. Farewell, Matthiette,--O indomitable\nheart! O brave perfect woman that I have loved! Now at the last of all, I\npraise you for your charity to me, Love's mendicant,--ah, believe me,\nMatthiette, that atones for aught which follows now. Come what may, I\nshall always remember that once in old days you loved me, and,\nremembering this, I shall always thank God with a contented heart.\" He\nbowed over her unresponsive hand. \"Matthiette,\" he whispered, \"be happy!\nFor I desire that very heartily, and I beseech of our Sovereign Lady--not\ncaring to hide at all how my voice shakes, nor how the loveliness of you,\nseen now for the last time, is making blind my eyes--that you may never\nknow unhappiness. You have chosen wisely, Matthiette; yet, ah, my dear,\ndo not forget me utterly, but keep always a little place in your heart\nfor your boy lover!\"\n\nSieur Raymond concluded his inspection of the tapestry, and turned with a\npremonitory cough. \"Thus ends the comedy,\" said he, shrugging, \"with much\nfine, harmless talking about 'always,' while the world triumphs.\nInvariably the world triumphs, my children. Eheu, we are as God made us,\nwe men and women that cumber His stately earth!\" He drew his arm through\nRaoul's. \"Farewell, niece,\" said Sieur Raymond, smiling; \"I rejoice that\nyou are cured of your malady. Now in respect to gerfalcons--\" said he.\nThe arras fell behind them.\n\n\n3. _Obdurate Love_\n\nMatthiette sat brooding in her room, as the night wore on. She was\npitifully frightened, numb. There was in the room, she dimly noted, a\nheavy silence that sobs had no power to shatter. Dimly, too, she seemed\naware of a multitude of wide, incurious eyes which watched her from every\ncorner, where panels snapped at times with sharp echoes. The night was\nwell-nigh done when she arose.\n\n\"After all,\" she said, wearily, \"it is my manifest duty.\" Matthiette\ncrept to the mirror and studied it.\n\n\"Madame de Puysange,\" said she, without any intonation; then threw her\narms above her head, with a hard gesture of despair. \"I love him!\" she\ncried, in a frightened voice.\n\nMatthiette went to a great chest and fumbled among its contents. She drew\nout a dagger in a leather case, and unsheathed it. The light shone evilly\nscintillant upon the blade. She laughed, and hid it in the bosom of her\ngown, and fastened a cloak about her with impatient fingers. Then\nMatthiette crept down the winding stair that led to the gardens, and\nunlocked the door at the foot of it.\n\nA sudden rush of night swept toward her, big with the secrecy of dawn.\nThe sky, washed clean of stars, sprawled above,--a leaden, monotonous\nblank. Many trees whispered thickly over the chaos of earth; to the left,\nin an increasing dove-colored luminousness, a field of growing maize\nbristled like the chin of an unshaven Titan.\n\nMatthiette entered an expectant world. Once in the tree-chequered\ngardens, it was as though she crept through the aisles of an unlit\ncathedral already garnished for its sacred pageant. Matthiette heard the\nquerulous birds call sleepily above; the margin of night was thick with\ntheir petulant complaints; behind her was the monstrous shadow of the\nChateau d'Arnaye, and past that was a sullen red, the red of contused\nflesh, to herald dawn. Infinity waited a-tiptoe, tense for the coming\nmiracle, and against this vast repression, her grief dwindled into\nirrelevancy: the leaves whispered comfort; each tree-bole hid chuckling\nfauns. Matthiette laughed. Content had flooded the universe all through\nand through now that yonder, unseen as yet, the scarlet-faced sun was\ntoiling up the rim of the world, and matters, it somehow seemed, could\nnot turn out so very ill, in the end.\n\nMatthiette came to a hut, from whose open window a faded golden glow\nspread out into obscurity like a tawdry fan. From without she peered into\nthe hut and saw Raoul. A lamp flickered upon the table. His shadow\ntwitched and wavered about the plastered walls,--a portentous mass of\nhead upon a hemisphere of shoulders,--as Raoul bent over a chest, sorting\nthe contents, singing softly to himself, while Matthiette leaned upon the\nsill without, and the gardens of Arnaye took form and stirred in the\nheart of a chill, steady, sapphire-like radiance.\n\nSang Raoul:\n\n  _\"Lord, I have worshipped thee ever,--\n  Through all these years\n  I have served thee, forsaking never\n  Light Love that veers\n  As a child between laughter and tears.\n  Hast thou no more to afford,--\n  Naught save laughter and tears,--\n  Love, my lord?\n\n  \"I have borne thy heaviest burden,\n  Nor served thee amiss:\n  Now thou hast given a guerdon;\n  Lo, it was this--\n  A sigh, a shudder, a kiss.\n  Hast thou no more to accord!\n  I would have more than this,\n  Love, my lord.\n\n  \"I am wearied of love that is pastime\n  And gifts that it brings;\n  I entreat of thee, lord, at this last time\n\n  \"In\u00e8ffable things.\n  Nay, have proud long-dead kings\n  Stricken no subtler chord,\n  Whereof the memory clings,\n  Love, my lord?\n\n  \"But for a little we live;\n  Show me thine innermost hoard!\n  Hast thou no more to give,\n  Love, my lord?\"_\n\n\n4. _Raymond Psychopompos_\n\nMatthiette went to the hut's door: her hands fell irresolutely upon the\nrough surface of it and lay still for a moment. Then with the noise of a\nhoarse groan the door swung inward, and the light guttered in a swirl of\nkeen morning air, casting convulsive shadows upon her lifted countenance,\nand was extinguished. She held out her arms in a gesture that was half\nmaternal. \"Raoul!\" she murmured.\n\nHe turned. A sudden bird plunged through the twilight without, with a\nglad cry that pierced like a knife through the stillness which had fallen\nin the little room. Raoul de Frison faced her, with clenched hands,\nsilent. For that instant she saw him transfigured.\n\nBut his silence frightened her. There came a piteous catch in her voice.\n\"Fair friend, have you not bidden me--_be happy?_\"\n\nHe sighed. \"Mademoiselle,\" he said, dully, \"I may not avail myself of\nyour tenderness of heart; that you have come to comfort me in my sorrow\nis a deed at which, I think, God's holy Angels must rejoice: but I cannot\navail myself of it.\"\n\n\"Raoul, Raoul,\" she said, \"do you think that I have come in--pity!\"\n\n\"Matthiette,\" he returned, \"your uncle spoke the truth. I have dreamed\ndreams concerning you,--dreams of a foolish, golden-hearted girl, who\nwould yield--yield gladly--all that the world may give, to be one flesh\nand soul with me. But I have wakened, dear, to the braver reality,--that\nvalorous woman, strong enough to conquer even her own heart that her\npeople may be freed from their peril.\"\n\n\"Blind! blind!\" she cried.\n\nRaoul smiled down upon her. \"Mademoiselle,\" said he, \"I do not doubt that\nyou love me.\"\n\nShe went wearily toward the window. \"I am not very wise,\" Matthiette\nsaid, looking out upon the gardens, \"and it appears that God has given\nme an exceedingly tangled matter to unravel. Yet if I decide it\nwrongly I think the Eternal Father will understand it is because I am\nnot very wise.\"\n\nMatthiette for a moment was silent. Then with averted face she spoke\nagain. \"My uncle commands me, with many astute saws and pithy sayings, to\nwed Monsieur de Puysange. I have not skill to combat him. Many times he\nhas proven it my duty, but he is quick in argument and proves what he\nwill; and I do not think it is my duty. It appears to me a matter wherein\nman's wisdom is at variance with God's will as manifested to us through\nthe holy Evangelists. Assuredly, if I do not wed Monsieur de Puysange\nthere may be war here in our Arnaye, and God has forbidden war; but I may\nnot insure peace in Arnaye without prostituting my body to a man I do not\nlove, and that, too, God has forbidden. I speak somewhat grossly for a\nmaid, but you love me, I think, and will understand. And I, also, love\nyou, Monsieur de Frison. Yet--ah, I am pitiably weak! Love tugs at my\nheart-strings, bidding me cling to you, and forget these other matters;\nbut I cannot do that, either. I desire very heartily the comfort and\nsplendor and adulation which you cannot give me. I am pitiably weak,\nRaoul! I cannot come to you with an undivided heart,--but my heart, such\nas it is, I have given you, and to-day I deliver my honor into your hands\nand my life's happiness, to preserve or to destroy. Mother of Christ,\ngrant that I have chosen rightly, for I have chosen now, past retreat! I\nhave chosen you, Raoul, and that love which you elect to give me, and of\nwhich I must endeavor to be worthy.\"\n\nMatthiette turned from the window. Now, her bright audacity gone, her\nardors chilled, you saw how like a grave, straightforward boy she was,\nhow illimitably tender, how inefficient. \"It may be that I have decided\nwrongly in this tangled matter,\" she said now. \"And yet I think that God,\nWho loves us infinitely, cannot be greatly vexed at anything His children\ndo for love of one another.\"\n\nHe came toward her. \"I bid you go,\" he said. \"Matthiette, it is my duty\nto bid you go, and it is your duty to obey.\"\n\nShe smiled wistfully through unshed tears. \"Man's wisdom!\" said\nMatthiette. \"I think that it is not my duty. And so I disobey you,\ndear,--this once, and no more hereafter.\"\n\n\"And yet last night--\" Raoul began.\n\n\"Last night,\" said she, \"I thought that I was strong. I know now it was\nmy vanity that was strong,--vanity and pride and fear, Raoul, that for a\nlittle mastered me. But in the dawn all things seem very trivial, saving\nlove alone.\"\n\nThey looked out into the dew-washed gardens. The daylight was fullgrown,\nand already the clear-cut forms of men were passing beneath the swaying\nbranches. In the distance a trumpet snarled.\n\n\"Dear love,\" said Raoul, \"do you not understand that you have brought\nabout my death? For Monsieur de Puysange is at the gates of Arnaye; and\neither he or Sieur Raymond will have me hanged ere noon.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said, in a tired voice. \"I think that Monsieur de\nPuysange has some cause to thank me; and my uncle loves me, and his\nheart, for all his gruffness, is very tender. And--see, Raoul!\" She drew\nthe dagger from her bosom. \"I shall not survive you a long while, O man\nof all the world!\"\n\nPerplexed joy flushed through his countenance. \"You will do\nthis--for me?\" he cried, with a sort of sob. \"Matthiette,\nMatthiette, you shame me!\"\n\n\"But I love you,\" said Matthiette. \"How could it be possible, then, for\nme to live after you were dead?\"\n\nHe bent to her. They kissed.\n\nHand in hand they went forth into the daylight. The kindly, familiar\nplace seemed in Matthiette's eyes oppressed and transformed by the\nausterity of dawn. It was a clear Sunday morning, at the hightide of\nsummer, and she found the world unutterably Sabbatical; only by a\nvigorous effort could memory connect it with the normal life of\nyesterday. The cool edges of the woods, vibrant now with multitudinous\nshrill pipings, the purple shadows shrinking eastward on the dimpling\nlawns, the intricate and broken traceries of the dial (where they had met\nso often), the blurred windings of their path, above which brooded the\npeaked roofs and gables and slender clerestories of Arnaye, the broad\nriver yonder lapsing through deserted sunlit fields,--these things lay\nbefore them scarce heeded, stript of all perspective, flat as an open\nscroll. To them all this was alien. She and Raoul were quite apart from\nthese matters, quite alone, despite the men of Arnaye, hurrying toward\nthe courtyard, who stared at them curiously, but said nothing. A brisk\nwind was abroad in the tree-tops, scattering stray leaves, already dead,\nover the lush grass. Tenderly Raoul brushed a little golden sycamore leaf\nfrom the lovelier gold of Matthiette's hair.\n\n\"I do not know how long I have to live,\" he said. \"Nobody knows that. But\nI wish that I might live a great while to serve you worthily.\"\n\nShe answered: \"Neither in life nor death shall we be parted now. That\nonly matters, my husband.\"\n\nThey came into the crowded court-yard just as the drawbridge fell. A\ntroop of horse clattered into Arnaye, and the leader, a young man of\nfrank countenance, dismounted and looked about him inquiringly. Then he\ncame toward them.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said he, \"you see that we ride early in honor of your\nnuptials.\"\n\nBehind them some one chuckled. \"Love one another, young people,\" said\nSieur Raymond; \"but do you, Matthiette, make ready to depart into\nNormandy as a true and faithful wife to Monsieur de Puysange.\"\n\nShe stared into Raoul's laughing face; there was a kind of anguish in her\nswift comprehension. Quickly the two men who loved her glanced at each\nother, half in shame.\n\nBut the Sieur d'Arnaye was not lightly dashed. \"Oh, la, la, la!\" chuckled\nthe Sieur d'Arnaye, \"she would never have given you a second thought,\nmonsieur le vicomte, had I not labelled you forbidden fruit. As it is, my\nlast conspiracy, while a little ruthless, I grant you, turns out\nadmirably. Jack has his Jill, and all ends merrily, like an old song. I\nwill begin on those pig-sties the first thing to-morrow morning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOCTOBER 6, 1519\n\n_\"Therefore, like as May month flowereth and flourisheth in many\ngardens, so in likewise let every man of worship flourish his heart in\nthis world; first unto God, and next unto the joy of them that he\npromiseth his faith unto.\"_\n\n\n_The quondam Raoul de Prison stood high in the graces of the Lady Regent\nof France, Anne de Beaujeu, who was, indeed, tolerably notorious for her\npartiality to well-built young men. Courtiers whispered more than there\nis any need here to rehearse. In any event, when in 1485 the daughter of\nLouis XI fitted out an expedition to press the Earl of Richmond's claim\nto the English crown, de Puysange sailed from Havre as commander of the\nFrench fleet. He fought at Bosworth, not discreditably; and a year\nafterward, when England had for the most part accepted Henry VII,\nMatthiette rejoined her husband.\n\nThey never subsequently quitted England. During the long civil wars, de\nPuysange was known as a shrewd captain and a judicious counsellor to the\nKing, who rewarded his services as liberally as Tudorian parsimony would\npermit. After the death of Henry VII, however, the vicomte took little\npart in public affairs, spending most of his time at Tiverton Manor, in\nDevon, where, surrounded by their numerous progeny, he and Matthiette\ngrew old together in peace and concord.\n\nIndeed, the vicomte so ordered all his cool love-affairs that, having\ntaken a wife as a matter of expediency, he continued as a matter of\nexpediency to make her a fair husband, as husbands go. It also seemed to\nhim, they relate, a matter of expediency to ignore the interpretation\ngiven by scandalous persons to the paternal friendship extended to Madame\nde Puysange by a high prince of the Church, during the last five years of\nthe great Cardinal Morton's life, for the connection was useful.\n\nThe following is from a manuscript of doubtful authenticity still to be\nseen at Allonby Shaw. It purports to contain the autobiography of Will\nSommers, the vicomte's jester, afterward court-fool to Henry VIII._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Episode Called The Castle of Content_\n\n\n1. _I Glimpse the Castle_\n\n\"And so, dearie,\" she ended, \"you may seize the revenues of Allonby with\nunwashed hands.\"\n\nI said, \"Why have you done this?\" I was half-frightened by the sudden\nwhirl of Dame Fortune's wheel.\n\n\"Dear cousin in motley,\" grinned the beldame, \"'twas for hatred of Tom\nAllonby and all his accursed race that I have kept the secret thus long.\nNow comes a braver revenge: and I settle my score with the black spawn of\nAllonby--euh, how entirely!--by setting you at their head.\"\n\n\"Nay, I elect for a more flattering reason. I begin to suspect you,\ncousin, of some human compunction.\"\n\n\"Well, Willie, well, I never hated you as much as I had reason to,\" she\ngrumbled, and began to cough very lamentably. \"So at the last I must make\na marquis of you--ugh! Will you jest for them in counsel, Willie, and\nlead your henchman to battle with a bawdy song--ugh, ugh!\"\n\nHer voice crackled like burning timber, and sputtered in groans that\nwould have been fanged curses had breath not failed her: for my aunt\nElinor possessed a nimble tongue, whetted, as rumor had it, by the\nattendance of divers Sabbats, and the chaunting of such songs as honest\nmen may not hear and live, however highly the succubi and warlocks and\nwere-cats, and Satan's courtiers generally, commend them.\n\nI squinted down at one green leg, scratched the crimson fellow to it with\nmy bauble, and could not deny that, even so, the witch was dealing\nhandsomely with me to-night.\n\n'Twas a strange tale which my Aunt Elinor had ended, speaking swiftly\nlest the worms grow impatient and Charon weigh anchor ere she had done:\nand the proofs of the tale's verity, set forth in a fair clerkly\nhandwriting, rustled in my hand,--scratches of a long-rotted pen that\ntransferred me to the right side of the blanket, and transformed the\nmotley of a fool into the ermine of a peer.\n\nAll Devon knew I was son to Tom Allonby, who had been Marquis of Falmouth\nat his uncle's death, had not Tom Allonby, upon the very eve of that\nevent, broken his neck in a fox-hunt; but Dan Gabriel, come post-haste\nfrom Heaven had with difficulty convinced the village idiot that Holy\nChurch had smiled upon Tom's union with a tanner's daughter, and that\ntheir son was lord of Allonby Shaw. I doubted it, even as I read the\nproof. Yet it was true,--true that I had precedence even of the great\nMonsieur de Puysange, who had kept me to make him mirth on a shifty diet,\nfirst coins, then curses, these ten years past,--true that my father,\nrogue in all else, had yet dealt equitably with my mother ere he\ndied,--true that my aunt, less honorably used by him, had shared their\nsecret with the priest who married them, maliciously preserving it till\nthis, when her words fell before me as anciently Jove's shower before the\nArgive Dana\u00eb, coruscant and awful, pregnant with undreamed-of chances\nwhich stirred as yet blindly in Time's womb.\n\nA sick anger woke in me, remembering the burden of ignoble years this hag\nhad suffered me to bear; yet my so young gentility bade me avoid reproach\nof the dying peasant woman, who, when all was said, had been but ill-used\nby our house. Death hath a strange potency: commanding as he doth,\nunquestioned and unchidden, the emperor to have done with slaying, the\npoet to rise from his unfinished rhyme, the tender and gracious lady to\ncease from nice denying words (mixed though they be with pitiful sighs\nthat break their sequence like an amorous ditty heard through the strains\nof a martial stave), and all men, gentle or base, to follow Death's gaunt\nstandard into unmapped realms, something of majesty enshrines the\npaltriest knave on whom the weight of Death's chill finger hath fallen. I\ndoubt not that Cain's children wept about his deathbed, and that the\ncenturions spake in whispers as they lowered Iscariot from the\nelder-tree: and in like manner the reproaches which stirred in my brain\nhad no power to move my lips. The frail carnal tenement, swept and\ncleansed of all mortality, was garnished for Death's coming; and I could\nnot sorrow at his advent here: but I perforce must pity rather than\nrevile the prey which Age and Poverty, those ravenous forerunning hounds\nof Death yet harried, at the door of the tomb.\n\nRunning over these considerations in my mind, I said, \"I forgive you.\"\n\n\"You posturing lack-wit!\" she returned, and her sunk jaws quivered\nangrily. \"D'ye play the condescending gentleman already! Dearie, your\nmaster did not take the news so calmly.\"\n\n\"You have told him?\"\n\nI had risen, for the wried, and yet sly, malice of my aunt's face was\nrather that of Bellona, who, as clerks avow, ever bore carnage and\ndissension in her train, than that of a mortal, mutton-fed woman. Elinor\nSommers hated me--having God knows how just a cause--for the reason that\nI was my father's son; and yet, for this same reason as I think, there\nwas in all our intercourse an odd, harsh, grudging sort of tenderness.\n\nShe laughed now,--flat and shrill, like the laughter of the damned heard\nin Hell between the roaring of flames. \"Were it not common kindness to\ntell him, since this old sleek fellow's fine daughter is to wed the\ncuckoo that hath your nest? Yes, Willie, yes, your master hath known\nsince morning.\"\n\n\"And Adeliza?\" I asked, in a voice that tricked me.\n\n\"Heh, my Lady-High-and-Mighty hath, I think, heard nothing as yet. She\nwill be hearing of new suitors soon enough, though, for her father,\nMonsieur Fine-Words, that silky, grinning thief, is very keen in a\nmoney-chase,--keen as a terrier on a rat-track, may Satan twist his neck!\nPshutt, dearie! here is a smiling knave who means to have the estate of\nAllonby as it stands; what live-stock may go therewith, whether\ncrack-brained or not, is all one to him. He will not balk at a drachm or\ntwo of wit in his son-in-law. You have but to whistle,--but to whistle,\nWillie, and she'll come!\"\n\nI said, \"Eh, woman, and have you no heart?\"\n\n\"I gave it to your father for a few lying speeches,\" she answered, \"and\nTom Allonby taught me the worth of all such commerce.\" There was a smile\nupon her lips, sister to that which Clytemnestra may have flaunted in\nwelcome of that old Emperor Agamemnon, come in gory opulence from the\nsack of Troy Town. \"I gave it--\" Her voice rose here to a despairing\nwail. \"Ah, go, before I lay my curse upon you, son of Thomas Allonby!\nBut do you kiss me first, for you have just his lying mouth. So, that is\nbetter! And now go, my lord marquis; it is not fitting that death\nshould intrude into your lordship's presence. Go, fool, and let me die\nin peace!\"\n\nI no longer cast a cautious eye toward the whip (ah, familiar unkindly\nwhip!) that still hung beside the door of the hut; but, I confess, my\naunt's looks were none too delectable, and ancient custom rendered her\nwrath yet terrible. If the farmers thereabouts were to be trusted, I knew\nOld Legion's bailiff would shortly be at hand, to distrain upon a soul\nescheat and forfeited to Dis by many years of cruel witchcrafts, close\nwiles, and nameless sorceries; and I could never abide unpared nails,\neven though they be red-hot. Therefore, I relinquished her to the village\ngossips, who waited without, and I tucked my bauble under my arm.\n\n\"Dear aunt,\" said I, \"farewell!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Willie!\" said she; \"I shall often laugh in Hell to think of\nthe crack-brained marquis that I made on earth. It was my will to make a\nbeggar of Tom's son, but at the last I play the fool and cannot do it.\nBut do you play the fool, too, dearie, and\"--she chuckled here--\"and have\nyour posture and your fine long words, whatever happens.\"\n\n\"'Tis my vocation,\" I answered, briefly; and so went forth into\nthe night.\n\n\n2. _At the Ladder's Foot_\n\nI came to Tiverton Manor through a darkness black as the lining of\nBaalzebub's oldest cloak. The storm had passed, but clouds yet hung\nheavy as feather-beds between mankind and the stars; as I crossed the\nbridge the swollen Exe was but dimly visible, though it roared beneath\nme, and shook the frail timbers hungrily. The bridge had long been\nunsafe: Monsieur de Puysange had planned one stronger and less hazardous\nthan the former edifice, of which the arches yet remained, and this was\nnow in the making, as divers piles of unhewn lumber and stone attested:\nmeanwhile, the roadway was a makeshift of half-rotten wood that even in\nthis abating wind shook villainously. I stood for a moment and heard the\nwaters lapping and splashing and laughing, as though they would hold it\nrare and desirable mirth to swallow and spew forth a powerful marquis,\nand grind his body among the battered timber and tree-boles and dead\nsheep swept from the hills, and at last vomit him into the sea, that a\ncorpse, wide-eyed and livid, might bob up and down the beach, in quest of\na quiet grave where the name of Allonby was scarcely known. The\nimagination was so vivid that it frightened me as I picked my way\ncat-footed through the dark.\n\nThe folk of Tiverton Manor were knotting on their nightcaps, by this; but\nthere was a light in the Lady Adeliza's window, faint as a sick glowworm.\nI rolled in the seeded grass and chuckled, as I thought of what a day or\ntwo might bring about, and I murmured to myself an old cradle-song of\nDevon which she loved and often sang; and was, ere I knew it, carolling\naloud, for pure wantonness and joy that Monsieur de Puysange was not\nlikely to have me whipped, now, however blatantly I might elect to\ndiscourse.\n\nSang I:\n\n  _\"Through the mist of years does it gleam as yet--\n  That fair and free extent\n  Of moonlit turret and parapet,\n  Which castled, once, Content?\n\n  \"Ei ho! Ei ho! the Castle of Content,\n  With drowsy music drowning merriment\n  Where Dreams and Visions held high carnival,\n  And frolicking frail Loves made light of all,--\n  Ei ho! the vanished Castle of Content!\"_\n\nAs I ended, the casement was pushed open, and the Lady Adeliza came upon\nthe balcony, the light streaming from behind her in such fashion as made\nher appear an angel peering out of Heaven at our mortal antics. Indeed,\nthere was always something more than human in her loveliness, though, to\nbe frank, it savored less of chilling paradisial perfection than of a\nvision of some great-eyed queen of faery, such as those whose feet glide\nunwetted over our fen-waters when they roam o' nights in search of unwary\ntravellers. Lady Adeliza was a fair beauty; that is, her eyes were of the\ncolor of opals, and her complexion as the first rose of spring, blushing\nat her haste to snare men's hearts with beauty; and her loosened hair\nrippled in such a burst of splendor that I have seen a pale brilliancy,\nlike that of amber, reflected by her bared shoulders where the bright\nwaves fell heavily against the tender flesh, and ivory vied with gold in\nbeauty. She was somewhat proud, they said; and to others she may have\nbeen, but to me, never. Her voice was a low, sweet song, her look that of\nthe chaste Roman, beneficent Saint Dorothy, as she is pictured in our\nChapel here at Tiverton. Proud, they called her! to me her condescensions\nwere so manifold that I cannot set them down: indeed, in all she spoke\nand did there was an extreme kindliness that made a courteous word from\nher of more worth than a purse from another.\n\nShe said, \"Is it you, Will Sommers?\"\n\n\"Madonna,\" I answered, \"with whom else should the owls confer? It is a\nvenerable saying that extremes meet. And here you may behold it\nexemplified, as in the conference of an epicure and an ostrich: though,\nfor this once, Wisdom makes bold to sit above Folly.\"\n\n\"Did you carol, then, to the owls of Tiverton?\" she queried.\n\n\"Hand upon heart,\" said I, \"my grim gossips care less for my melody than\nfor the squeaking of a mouse; and I sang rather for joy that at last I\nmay enter into the Castle of Content.\"\n\nThe Lady Adeliza replied, \"But nobody enters there alone.\"\n\n\"Madonna,\" said I, \"your apprehension is nimble. I am in hope that a\nwoman's hand may lower the drawbridge.\"\n\nShe said only \"You--!\" Then she desisted, incredulous laughter breaking\nthe soft flow of speech.\n\n\"Now, by Paul and Peter, those eminent apostles! the prophet Jeremy never\nspake more veraciously in Edom! The fool sighs for a fair woman,--what\nelse should he do, being a fool? Ah, madonna, as in very remote times\nthat notable jester, Love, popped out of Night's wind-egg, and by his\nsorcery fashioned from the primeval tangle the pleasant earth that sleeps\nabout us,--even thus, may he not frame the disorder of a fool's brain\ninto the semblance of a lover's? Believe me, the change is not so great\nas you might think. Yet if you will, laugh at me, madonna, for I love a\nwoman far above me,--a woman who knows not of my love, or, at most,\nconsiders it but as the homage which grateful peasants accord the\nall-nurturing sun; so that, now chance hath woven me a ladder whereby to\nmount to her, I scarcely dare to set my foot upon the bottom rung.\"\n\n\"A ladder?\" she said, oddly: \"and are you talking of a rope ladder?\"\n\n\"I would describe it, rather,\" said I, \"as a golden ladder.\"\n\nThere came a silence. About us the wind wailed among the gaunt, deserted\nchoir of the trees, and in the distance an owl hooted sardonically.\n\nThe Lady Adeliza said: \"Be bold. Be bold, and know that a woman loves\nonce and forever, whether she will or no. Love is not sold in the shops,\nand the grave merchants that trade in the ultimate seas, and send forth\nargosies even to jewelled Ind, to fetch home rich pearls, and strange\noutlandish dyes, and spiceries, and the raiment of imperious queens of\nthe old time, have bought and sold no love, for all their traffic. It is\nabove gold. I know\"--here her voice faltered somewhat--\"I know of a woman\nwhose birth is very near the throne, and whose beauty, such as it is,\nhath been commended, who loved a man the politic world would have none\nof, for he was not rich nor famous, nor even very wise. And the world\nbade her relinquish him; but within the chambers of her heart his voice\nrang more loudly than that of the world, and for his least word said she\nwould leave all and go with him whither he would. And--she waits only for\nthe speaking of that word.\"\n\n\"Be bold?\" said I.\n\n\"Ay,\" she returned; \"that is the moral of my tale. Make me a song of it\nto-night, dear Will,--and tomorrow, perhaps, you may learn how this\nwoman, too, entered into the Castle of Content.\"\n\n\"Madonna--!\" I cried.\n\n\"It is late,\" said she, \"and I must go.\"\n\n\"To-morrow--?\" I said. My heart was racing now.\n\n\"Ay, to-morrow,--the morrow that by this draws very near. Farewell!\" She\nwas gone, casting one swift glance backward, even as the ancient\nParthians are fabled to have shot their arrows as they fled; and, if the\nairier missile, also, left a wound, I, for one, would not willingly have\nquitted her invulnerate.\n\n3. _Night, and a Stormed Castle_\n\nI went forth into the woods that stand thick about Tiverton Manor, where\nI lay flat on my back among the fallen leaves, dreaming many dreams to\nmyself,--dreams that were frolic songs of happiness, to which the papers\nin my jerkin rustled a reassuring chorus.\n\nI have heard that night is own sister to death; now, as the ultimate torn\ncloud passed seaward, and the new-washed harvest-moon broke forth in a\nred glory, and stars clustered about her like a swarm of golden bees, I\nthought this night was rather the parent of a new life. But, indeed,\nthere is a solemnity in night beyond all jesting: for night knits up the\ntangled yarn of our day's doings into a pattern either good or ill; it\nrenews the vigor of the living, and with the lapsing of the tide it draws\nthe dying toward night's impenetrable depths, gently; and it honors the\nsecrecy of lovers as zealously as that of rogues. In the morning our\nbodies rise to their allotted work; but our wits have had their season in\nthe night, or of kissing, or of junketing, or of high resolve; and the\ngreater part of such noble deeds as day witnesses have been planned in\nthe solitude of night. It is the sage counsellor, the potent physician\nthat heals and comforts the sorrows of all the world: and night proved\nsuch to me, as I pondered on the proud race of Allonby, and knew that in\nthe general record of time my name must soon be set as a sonorous word\nsignificant, as the cat might jump, for much good or for large evil.\n\nAnd Adeliza loved me, and had bidden me be bold! I may not write of what\nmy thoughts were as I considered that stupendous miracle.\n\nBut even the lark that daily soars into the naked presence of the sun\nmust seek his woven nest among the grass at twilight; and so, with many\nyawns, I rose after an hour of dreams to look for sleep. Tiverton Manor\nwas a formless blot on the mild radiance of the heavens, but I must needs\npause for a while, gazing up at the Lady Adeliza's window, like a hen\ndrinking water, and thinking of divers matters.\n\nIt was then that something rustled among the leaves, and, turning, I\nstared into the countenance of Stephen Allonby, until to-day Marquis of\nFalmouth, a slim, comely youth, and son to my father's younger brother.\n\n\"Fool,\" said he, \"you walk late.\"\n\n\"Faith!\" said I, \"instinct warned me that a fool might find fit company\nhere,--dear cousin.\" He frowned at the word, for he was never prone to\nadmit the relationship, being in disposition somewhat precise.\n\n\"Eh?\" said he; then paused for a while. \"I have more kinsmen than I knew\nof,\" he resumed, at length, \"and to-day spawns them thick as herrings.\nYour greeting falls strangely pat with that of a brother of yours,\nalleged to be begot in lawful matrimony, who hath appeared to claim the\ntitle and estates, and hath even imposed upon the credulity of Monsieur\nde Puysange.\"\n\nI said, \"And who is this new kinsman?\" though his speaking had brought my\nheart into my mouth. \"I have many brethren, if report speak truly as to\nhow little my poor father slept at night.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said he. \"The vicomte had not told me more than half the\ntale when I called him a double-faced old rogue. Thereafter we\nparted--well, rather hastily!\"\n\nI was moved with a sort of pity, since it was plainer than a pike-staff\nthat Monsieur de Puysange had bundled this penniless young fellow out of\nTiverton, with scant courtesy and a scantier explanation. Still, the\nwording of this sympathy was a ticklish business. I waved my hand upward.\n\"The match, then, is broken off, between you and the Lady Adeliza?\"\n\n\"Ay!\" my cousin said, grimly.\n\nAgain I was nonplussed. Since their betrothal was an affair of rank\nconveniency, my Cousin Stephen should, in reason, grieve at this\nmiscarriage temperately, and yet if by some awkward chance he, too,\nadored the delicate comeliness asleep above us, equity conceded his taste\nto be unfortunate rather than remarkable. Inwardly I resolved to bestow\nupon my Cousin Stephen a competence, and to pick out for him somewhere a\nwife better suited to his station. Meanwhile a silence fell.\n\nHe cleared his throat; swore softly to himself; took a brief turn on the\ngrass; and approached me, purse in hand. \"It is time you were abed,\" said\nmy cousin.\n\nI assented to this. \"And since one may sleep anywhere,\" I reasoned, \"why\nnot here?\" Thereupon, for I was somewhat puzzled at his bearing, I lay\ndown upon the gravel and snored.\n\n\"Fool,\" he said. I opened one eye. \"I have business here\"--I opened\nthe other--\"with the Lady Adeliza.\" He tossed me a coin as I sprang\nto my feet.\n\n\"Sir--!\" I cried out.\n\n\"Ho, she expects me.\"\n\n\"In that case--\" said I.\n\n\"The difficulty is to give a signal.\"\n\n\"'Tis as easy as lying,\" I reassured him; and thereupon I began to sing.\n\nSang I:\n\n  _\"Such toll we took of his niggling hours\n  That the troops of Time were sent\n  To seise the treasures and fell the towers\n  Of the Castle of Content.\n\n  \"Ei ho! Ei ho! the Castle of Content,\n  With flaming tower and tumbling battlement\n  Where Time hath conquered, and the firelight streams\n  Above sore-wounded Loves and dying Dreams,--\n  Ei ho! the vanished Castle of Content!\"_\n\nAnd I had scarcely ended when the casement opened.\n\n\"Stephen!\" said the Lady Adeliza.\n\n\"Dear love!\" said he.\n\n\"Humph!\" said I.\n\nHere a rope-ladder unrolled from the balcony and hit me upon the head.\n\n\"Regard the orchard for a moment,\" the Lady Adeliza said, with the\nwonderfullest little laugh.\n\nMy cousin indignantly protested, \"I have company,--a burr that\nsticks to me.\"\n\n\"A fool,\" I explained,--\"to keep him in countenance.\"\n\n\"It was ever the part of folly,\" said she, laughing yet again, \"to be\nswayed by a woman; and it is the part of wisdom to be discreet. In any\nevent, there must be no spectators.\"\n\nSo we two Allonbys held each a strand of the ladder and stared at the\nripening apples, black globes among the wind-vext silver of the leaves.\nIn a moment the Lady Adeliza stood between us. Her hand rested upon mine\nas she leapt to the ground,--the tiniest velvet-soft ounce-weight that\never set a man's blood a-tingle.\n\n\"I did not know--\" said she.\n\n\"Faith, madonna!\" said I, \"no more did I till this. I deduce but now that\nthe Marquis of Falmouth is the person you discoursed of an hour since,\nwith whom you hope to enter the Castle of Content.\"\n\n\"Ah, Will! dear Will, do not think lightly of me,\" she said. \"My\nfather--\"\n\n\"Is as all of them have been since Father Adam's dotage,\" I ended; \"and\ntherefore is keeping fools and honest horses from their rest.\"\n\nMy cousin said, angrily, \"You have been spying!\"\n\n\"Because I know that there are horses yonder?\" said I. \"And fools\nhere--and everywhere? Surely, there needs no argent-bearded Merlin come\nyawning out of Brocheliaunde to inform us of that.\"\n\nHe said, \"You will be secret?\"\n\n\"In comparison,\" I answered, \"the grave is garrulous, and a death's-head\na chattering magpie; yet I think that your maid, madonna,--\"\n\n\"Beatris is sworn to silence.\"\n\n\"Which signifies she is already on her way to Monsieur de Puysange. She\nwas coerced; she discovered it too late; and a sufficiency of tears and\npious protestations will attest her innocence. It is all one.\" I winked\nan eye very sagely.\n\n\"Your jesting is tedious,\" my cousin said. \"Come, Adeliza!\"\n\nBlaise, my lord marquis' French servant, held three horses in the\nshadow, so close that it was incredible I had not heard their trampling.\nNow the lovers mounted and were off like thistledown ere Blaise put foot\nto stirrup.\n\n\"Blaise,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh\u00e9!\" said he, pausing.\n\n\"--if, upon this pleasurable occasion, I were to borrow your horse--\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"If I were to take it by force--\" I exhibited my coin.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"--no one could blame you.\"\n\n\"And yet perhaps--\"\n\n\"The deduction is illogical,\" said I. And pushing him aside, I mounted\nand set out into the night after my cousin and the Lady Adeliza.\n\n\n4. _All Ends in a Puff of Smoke_\n\nThey rode leisurely enough along the winding highway that lay in the\nmoonlight like a white ribbon in a pedlar's box; and staying as I did\nsome hundred yards behind, they thought me no other than Blaise, being,\nindeed, too much engrossed with each other to regard the outer world very\nstrictly. So we rode a matter of three miles in the whispering, moonlit\nwoods, they prattling and laughing as though there were no such monster\nin all the universe as a thrifty-minded father, and I brooding upon many\nthings beside my marquisate, and keeping an ear cocked backward for\npossible pursuit.\n\nIn any ordinary falling out of affairs they would ride unhindered to\nTeignmouth, and thence to Allonby Shaw; they counted fully upon doing\nthis; but I, knowing Beatris, who was waiting-maid to the Lady Adeliza,\nand consequently in the plot, to be the devil's own vixen, despite an\ninnocent face and a wheedling tongue, was less certain.\n\nI shall not easily forget that riding away from the old vicomte's\npreparations to make a match of it between Adeliza and me. About us the\nwoods sighed and whispered, dappled by the moonlight with unstable\nchequerings of blue and silver. Tightly he clung to my crupper, that\nswart tireless horseman, Care; but ahead rode Love, anterior to all\nthings and yet eternally young, in quest of the Castle of Content. The\nhorses' hoofs beat against the pebbles as if in chorus to the Devon\ncradle-song that rang idly in my brain. 'Twas little to me--now--whether\nthe quest were won or lost; yet, as I watched the Lady Adeliza's white\ncloak tossing and fluttering in the wind, my blood pulsed more strongly\nthan it is wont to do, and was stirred by the keen odors of the night and\nby many memories of her gracious kindliness and by a desire to serve\nsomewhat toward the attainment of her happiness. Thus it was that my\nteeth clenched, and a dog howled in the distance, and the world seemed\nvery old and very incurious of our mortal woes and joys.\n\nThen that befell which I had looked for, and I heard the clatter of\nhorses' hoofs behind us, and knew that Monsieur de Puysange and his men\nwere at hand to rescue the Lady Adeliza from my fine-looking young\ncousin, to put her into the bed of a rich fool. So I essayed a gallop.\n\n\"Spur!\" I cried;--\"in the name of Saint Cupid!\"\n\nWith a little gasp, she bent forward over her horse's mane, urging him\nonward with every nerve and muscle of her tender body. I could not keep\nmy gaze from her as we swept through the night. Picture Europa in her\ntraverse, bull-borne, through the summer sea, the depths giving up their\nmisshapen deities, and the blind sea-snakes writhing about her in hideous\nhomage, while she, a little frightened, thinks resolutely of Crete beyond\nthese unaccustomed horrors and of the god desirous of her contentation;\nand there, to an eyelash, you have Adeliza as I saw her.\n\nBut steadily our pursuers gained on us: and as we paused to pick our way\nover the frail bridge that spanned the Exe, their clamor was very near.\n\n\"Take care!\" I cried,--but too late, for my horse swerved under me as I\nspoke, and my lord marquis' steed caught foot in a pile of lumber and\nfell heavily. He was up in a moment, unhurt, but the horse was lamed.\n\n\"You!\" cried my Cousin Stephen. \"Oh, but what fiend sends me this\nburr again!\"\n\nI said: \"My fellow-madmen, it is all one if I have a taste for\nnight-riding and the shedding of noble blood. Alack, though, that I have\nleft my brave bauble at Tiverton! Had I that here, I might do such deeds!\nI might show such prowess upon the person of Monsieur de Puysange as\nyour Nine Worthies would quake to hear of! For I have the honor to inform\nyou, my doves, that we are captured.\"\n\nIndeed, we were in train to be, for even the two sound horses were\nwell-nigh foundered: Blaise, the idle rogue, had not troubled to provide\nfresh steeds, so easy had the flitting seemed; and it was conspicuous\nthat we would be overtaken in half an hour.\n\n\"So it seems,\" said Stephen Allonby. \"Well! one can die but once.\" Thus\nspeaking, he drew his sword with an air which might have been envied by\nCaptain Leonidas at Thermopylae.\n\n\"Together, my heart!\" she cried.\n\n\"Madonna,\" said I, dismounting as I spoke, \"pray you consider! With\nneither of you, is there any question of death; 'tis but that Monsieur de\nPuysange desires you to make a suitable match. It is not yet too late;\nhis heart is kindly so long as he gets his will and profit everywhere,\nand he bears no malice toward my lord marquis. Yield, then, to your\nfather's wishes, since there is no choice.\"\n\nShe stared at me, as thanks for this sensible advice. \"And you--is it you\nthat would enter into the Castle of Content?\" she cried, with a scorn\nthat lashed.\n\nI said: \"Madonna, bethink you, you know naught of this man your father\ndesires you to wed. Is it not possible that he, too, may love--or may\nlearn to love you, on provocation? You are very fair, madonna. Yours is a\nbeauty that may draw a man to Heaven or unclose the gates of Hell, at\nwill; indeed, even I, in my poor dreams, have seen your face as bright\nand glorious as is the lighted space above the altar when Christ's blood\nand body are shared among His worshippers. Men certainly will never cease\nto love you. Will he--your husband that may be--prove less susceptible,\nwe will say, than I? Ah, but, madonna, let us unrein imagination!\nSuppose, were it possible, that he--even now--yearns to enter into the\nCastle of Content, and that your hand, your hand alone, may draw the bolt\nfor him,--that the thought of you is to him as a flame before which honor\nand faith shrivel as shed feathers, and that he has loved you these many\nyears, unknown to you, long, long before the Marquis of Falmouth came\ninto your life with his fair face and smooth sayings. Suppose, were it\npossible, that he now stood before you, every pulse and fibre of him\nracked with an intolerable ecstasy of loving you, his heart one vast\nhunger for you, Adeliza, and his voice shaking as my voice shakes, and\nhis hands trembling as my hands tremble,--ah, see how they tremble,\nmadonna, the poor foolish hands! Suppose, were it possible,--\"\n\n\"Fool! O treacherous fool!\" my cousin cried, in a fine rage.\n\nShe rested her finger-tips upon his arm. \"Hush!\" she bade him; then\nturned to me an uncertain countenance that was half pity, half wonder.\n\"Dear Will,\" said she, \"if you have ever known aught of love, do you not\nunderstand how I love Stephen here?\"\n\nBut she did not any longer speak as a lord's daughter speaks to the fool\nthat makes mirth for his betters.\n\n\"In that case,\" said I,--and my voice played tricks,--\"in that case, may\nI request that you assist me in gathering such brushwood as we may find\nhereabout?\"\n\nThey both stared at me now. \"My lord,\" I said, \"the Exe is high, the\nbridge is of wood, and I have flint and steel in my pocket. The ford is\nfive miles above and quite impassable. Do you understand me, my lord?\"\n\nHe clapped his hands. \"Oh, excellent!\" he cried.\n\nThen, each having caught my drift, we heaped up a pile of broken boughs\nand twigs and brushwood on the bridge, all three gathering it together.\nAnd I wondered if the moon, that is co-partner in the antics of most\nrogues and lovers, had often beheld a sight more reasonless than the\nforegathering of a marquis, a peer's daughter, and a fool at dead of\nnight to make fagots.\n\nWhen we had done I handed him the flint and steel. \"My lord,\" said I,\n\"the honor is yours.\"\n\n\"Udsfoot!\" he murmured, in a moment, swearing and striking futile sparks,\n\"but the late rain has so wet the wood that it will not kindle.\"\n\nI said, \"Assuredly, in such matters a fool is indispensable.\" I heaped\nbefore him the papers that made an honest woman of my mother and a\nmarquis of me, and seizing the flint, I cast a spark among them that set\nthem crackling cheerily. Oh, I knew well enough that patience would coax\na flame from those twigs without my paper's aid, but to be patient does\nnot afford the posturing which youth loves. So it was a comfort to wreck\nall magnificently: and I knew that, too, as we three drew back upon the\nwestern bank and watched the writhing twigs splutter and snap and burn.\n\nThe bridge caught apace and in five minutes afforded passage to nothing\nshort of the ardent equipage of the prophet Elias. Five minutes later the\nbridge did not exist: only the stone arches towered above the roaring\nwaters that glistened in the light of the fire, which had, by this,\nreached the other side of the river, to find quick employment in the\nwoods of Tiverton. Our pursuers rode through a glare which was that of\nHell's kitchen on baking-day, and so reached the Exe only to curse vainly\nand to shriek idle imprecations at us, who were as immune from their\nanger as though the severing river had been Pyriphlegethon.\n\n\"My lord,\" I presently suggested, \"it may be that your priest\nexpects you?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said he, laughing, \"it is possible. Let us go.\" Thereupon they\nmounted the two sound horses. \"Most useful burr,\" said he, \"do you follow\non foot to Teignmouth; and there--\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I replied, \"my home is at Tiverton.\"\n\nHe wheeled about. \"Do you not fear--?\"\n\n\"The whip?\" said I. \"Ah, my lord, I have been whipped ere this. It is\nnot the greatest ill in life to be whipped.\"\n\nHe began to protest.\n\n\"But, indeed, I am resolved,\" said I. \"Farewell!\"\n\nHe tossed me his purse. \"As you will,\" he retorted, shortly. \"We thank\nyou for your aid; and if I am still master of Allonby--\"\n\n\"No fear of that!\" I said. \"Farewell, good cousin marquis! I cannot weep\nat your going, since it brings you happiness. And we have it on excellent\nauthority that the laughter of fools is as the crackling of thorns under\na pot. Accordingly, I bid you God-speed in a discreet silence.\"\n\nI stood fumbling my cousin's gold as he went forward into the night; but\nshe did not follow.\n\n\"I am sorry--\" she began. She paused and the lithe fingers fretted with\nher horse's mane.\n\nI said: \"Madonna, earlier in this crowded night, you told me of love's\nnature: must my halting commentary prove the glose upon your text? Look,\nthen, to be edified while the fool is delivered of his folly. For upon\nthe maternal side, love was born of the ocean, madonna, and the ocean is\nbut salt water, and salt water is but tears; and thus may love claim\nlove's authentic kin with sorrow. Ay, certainly, madonna, Fate hath\nordained for her diversion that through sorrow alone we lovers may attain\nto the true Castle of Content.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, and the wind wailed among the falling,\ntattered leaves. \"Had I but known--\" said Adeliza, very sadly.\n\nI said: \"Madonna, go forward and God speed you! Yonder your lover waits\nfor you, and the world is exceedingly fair; here is only a fool. As for\nthis new Marquis of Falmouth, let him trouble you no longer. 'Tis an\nEastern superstition that we lackbrains are endowed with peculiar gifts\nof prophecy: and as such, I predict, very confidently, madonna, that you\nwill see and hear no more of him in this life.\"\n\nI caught my breath. In the moonlight she seemed God's master-work. Her\neyes were big with half-comprehended sorrow, and a slender hand stole\ntimorously toward me. I laughed, seeing how she strove to pity my great\nsorrow and could not, by reason of her great happiness. I laughed and was\ncontent. \"As surely as God reigns in Heaven,\" I cried aloud, \"I am\ncontent, and this moment is well purchased with a marquisate!\"\n\nIndeed, I was vastly uplift and vastly pleased with my own nobleness,\njust then, and that condition is always a comfort.\n\nMore alertly she regarded me; and in her eyes I saw the anxiety and the\nwonder merge now into illimitable pity. \"That, too!\" she said, smiling\nsadly. \"That, too, O son of Thomas Allonby!\" And her mothering arms were\nclasped about me, and her lips clung and were one with my lips for a\nmoment, and her tears were wet upon my cheek. She seemed to shield me,\nmaking of her breast my sanctuary.\n\n\"My dear, my dear, I am not worthy!\" said Adeliza, with a tenderness I\ncannot tell you of; and presently she, too, was gone.\n\nI mounted the lamed horse, who limped slowly up the river bank; very\nslowly we came out from the glare of the crackling fire into the cool\ndarkness of the autumn woods; very slowly, for the horse was lamed and\nwearied, and patience is a discreet virtue when one journeys toward\ncurses and the lash of a dog-whip: and I thought of many quips and jests\nwhereby to soothe the anger of Monsieur de Puysange, and I sang to myself\nas I rode through the woods, a nobleman no longer, a tired Jack-pudding\nwhose tongue must save his hide.\n\nSang I:\n\n  _\"The towers are fallen; no laughter rings\n  Through the rafters, charred and rent;\n  The ruin is wrought of all goodly things\n  In the Castle of Content.\n\n  \"Ei ho! Ei ho! the Castle of Content,\n  Rased in the Land of Youth, where mirth was meant!\n  Nay, all is ashes 'there; and all in vain\n  Hand-shadowed eyes turn backward, to regain\n  Disastrous memories of that dear domain,--\n  Ei ho! the vanished Castle of Content!\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMAY 27, 1559\n\n_\"'O welladay!' said Beichan then,\n'That I so soon have married thee!\nFor it can be none but Susie Pie,\nThat sailed the sea for love of me.'\"_\n\n\n_How Will Sommers encountered the Marchioness of Falmouth in the\nCardinal's house at Whitehall, and how in Windsor Forest that noble lady\ndied with the fool's arms about her, does not concern us here. That is\nmatter for another tale.\n\nYou are not, though, to imagine any scandal. Barring an affair with Sir\nHenry Rochford, and another with Lord Norreys, and the brief interval in\n1525 when the King was enamored of her, there is no record that the\nmarchioness ever wavered from the choice her heart had made, or had any\nespecial reason to regret it.\n\nSo she lived and died, more virtuously and happily than most, and found\nthe marquis a fair husband, as husbands go; and bore him three sons and\na daughter.\n\nBut when the ninth Marquis of Falmouth died long after his wife, in the\nNovember of 1557, he was survived by only one of these sons, a junior\nStephen, born in 1530, who at his father's demise succeeded to the title.\nThe oldest son, Thomas, born 1531, had been killed in Wyatt's Rebellion\nin 1554; the second, George, born 1526, with a marked look of the King,\nwas, in February, 1556, stabbed in a disreputable tavern brawl.\n\nNow we have to do with the tenth Marquis of Falmouth's suit for the hand\nof Lady Ursula Heleigh, the Earl of Brudenel's co-heiress. You are to\nimagine yourself at Longaville Court, in Sussex, at a time when Anne\nBullen's daughter was very recently become Queen of England._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_The Episode Called In Ursula's Garden_\n\n\n1. Love, and Love's Mimic\n\nHer three lovers had praised her with many canzonets and sonnets on that\nMay morning as they sat in the rose-garden at Longaville, and the\nsun-steeped leaves made a tempered aromatic shade about them. Afterward\nthey had drawn grass-blades to decide who should accompany the Lady\nUrsula to the summer pavilion, that she might fetch her viol and sing\nthem a song of love, and in the sylvan lottery chance had favored the\nEarl of Pevensey.\n\nLeft to themselves, the Marquis of Falmouth and Master Richard Mervale\nregarded each the other, irresolutely, like strange curs uncertain\nwhether to fraternize or to fly at one another's throat. Then Master\nMervale lay down in the young grass, stretched himself, twirled his thin\nblack mustachios, and chuckled in luxurious content.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said he, \"your lordship is past master in the art of\nwooing; no university in the world would refuse you a degree.\"\n\nThe marquis frowned. He was a great bluff man, with wheat-colored hair,\nand was somewhat slow-witted. After a little he found the quizzical,\nboyish face that mocked him irresistible, and he laughed, and unbent from\nthe dignified reserve which he had for a while maintained portentously.\n\n\"Master Mervale,\" said the marquis, \"I will be frank with you, for you\nappear a lad of good intelligence, as lads run, and barring a trifle of\naffectation and a certain squeamishness in speech. When I would go\nexploring into a woman's heart, I must pay my way in the land's current\ncoinage of compliments and high-pitched protestations. Yes, yes, such\nsixpenny phrases suffice the seasoned traveler, who does not\nostentatiously display his gems while traveling. Now, in courtship,\nMaster Mervale, one traverses ground more dubious than the Indies, and\nthe truth, Master Mervale, is a jewel of great price.\"\n\nMaster Mervale raised his eyebrows. \"The truth?\" he queried, gently. \"Now\nhow, I wonder, did your lordship happen to think of that remote\nabstraction.\" For beyond doubt, Lord Falmouth's wooing had been that\nmorning of a rather florid sort.\n\nHowever, \"It would surely be indelicate,\" the marquis suggested, \"to\nallow even truth to appear quite unclothed in the presence of a lady?\" He\nsmiled and took a short turn on the grass. \"Look you, Master Mervale,\"\nsaid he, narrowing his pale-blue eyes to slits, \"I have, somehow, a\ndisposition to confidence come upon me. Frankly, my passion for the Lady\nUrsula burns more mildly than that which Antony bore the Egyptian; it is\nless a fire to consume kingdoms than a candle wherewith to light a\ncontented home; and quite frankly, I mean to have her. The estates lie\nconvenient, the families are of equal rank, her father is agreed, and she\nhas a sufficiency of beauty; there are, in short, no obstacles to our\nunion save you and my lord of Pevensey, and these, I confess, I do not\nfear. I can wait, Master Mervale. Oh, I am patient, Master Mervale, but,\nI own, I cannot brook denial. It is I, or no one. By Saint Gregory! I\nwear steel at my side, Master Mervale, that will serve for other purposes\nsave that of opening oysters!\" So he blustered in the spring sunlight,\nand frowned darkly when Master Mervale appeared the more amused than\nimpressed.\n\n\"Your patience shames Job the Patriarch,\" said Master Mervale, \"yet, it\nseems to me, my lord, you do not consider one thing. I grant you that\nPevensey and I are your equals neither in estate nor reputation; still,\nsetting modesty aside, is it not possible the Lady Ursula may come, in\ntime, to love one of us?\"\n\n\"Setting common sense aside,\" said the marquis, stiffly, \"it is possible\nshe may be smitten with the smallpox. Let us hope, however, that she may\nescape both of these misfortunes.\"\n\nThe younger man refrained from speech for a while. Presently, \"You liken\nlove to a plague,\" he said, \"yet I have heard there was once a cousin of\nthe Lady Ursula's--a Mistress Katherine Beaufort--\"\n\n\"Swounds!\" Lord Falmouth had wheeled about, scowled, and then tapped\nsharply upon the palm of one hand with the nail-bitten fingers of the\nother. \"Ay,\" said he, more slowly, \"there was such a person.\"\n\n\"She loved you?\" Master Mervale suggested.\n\n\"God help me!\" replied the marquis; \"we loved each other! I know not how\nyou came by your information, nor do I ask. Yet, it is ill to open an old\nwound. I loved her; let that suffice.\" With a set face, he turned away\nfor a moment and gazed toward the high parapets of Longaville,\nhalf-hidden by pale foliage and very white against the rain-washed sky;\nthen groaned, and glared angrily into the lad's upturned countenance.\n\"You talk of love,\" said the marquis; \"a love compounded equally of\nyouthful imagination, a liking for fantastic phrases and a disposition\nfor caterwauling i' the moonlight. Ah, lad, lad!--if you but knew! That\nis not love; to love is to go mad like a star-struck moth, and afterward\nto strive in vain to forget, and to eat one's heart out in the\nloneliness, and to hunger--hunger--\" The marquis spread his big hands\nhelplessly, and then, with a quick, impatient gesture, swept back the\nmass of wheat-colored hair that fell about his face. \"Ah, Master\nMervale,\" he sighed, \"I was right after all,--it is the cruelest plague\nin the world, and that same smallpox leaves less troubling scars.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" Master Mervale said, with courteous interest, \"you did not marry?\"\n\n\"Marry!\" His lordship snarled toward the sun and laughed. \"Look you,\nMaster Mervale, I know not how far y'are acquainted with the business. It\nwas in Cornwall yonder years since; I was but a lad, and she a\nwench,--Oh, such a wench, with tender blue eyes, and a faint, sweet voice\nthat could deny me nothing! God does not fashion her like every\nday,--_Dieu qui la fist de ses deux mains_, saith the Frenchman.\" The\nmarquis paced the grass, gnawing his lip and debating with himself.\n\"Marry? Her family was good, but their deserts outranked their fortunes;\ntheir crest was not the topmost feather in Fortune's cap, you understand;\nsomewhat sunken i' the world, Master Mervale, somewhat sunken. And I? My\nfather--God rest his bones!--was a cold, hard man, and my two elder\nbrothers--Holy Virgin, pray for them!--loved me none too well. I was the\ncadet then: Heaven helps them that help themselves, says my father, and I\nha'n't a penny for you. My way was yet to make in the world; to saddle\nmyself with a dowerless wench--even a wench whose least 'Good-morning'\nset a man's heart hammering at his ribs--would have been folly, Master\nMervale. Utter, improvident, shiftless, bedlamite folly, lad!\"\n\n\"H'm!\" Master Mervale cleared his throat, twirled his mustachios, and\nsmiled at some unspoken thought. \"We pay for our follies in this\nworld, my lord, but I sometimes think that we pay even more dearly for\nour wisdom.\"\n\n\"Ah, lad, lad!\" the marquis cried, in a gust of anger; \"I dare say, as\nyour smirking hints, it was a coward's act not to snap fingers at fate\nand fathers and dare all! Well! I did not dare. We parted--in what\nlamentable fashion is now of little import--and I set forth to seek my\nfortune. Ho, it was a brave world then, Master Mervale, for all the tears\nthat were scarce dried on my cheeks! A world wherein the heavens were as\nblue as a certain woman's eyes,--a world wherein a likely lad might see\nfar countries, waggle a good sword in Babylon and Tripolis and other\nultimate kingdoms, beard the Mussulman in his mosque, and at last fetch\nhome--though he might never love her, you understand--a soldan's daughter\nfor his wife,--\n\n  _With more gay gold about her middle\n  Than would buy half Northumberlee.\"_\n\nHis voice died away. He sighed and shrugged. \"Eh, well!\" said the\nmarquis; \"I fought in Flanders somewhat--in Spain--what matter where?\nThen, at last, sickened in Amsterdam, three years ago, where a messenger\ncomes to haul me out of bed as future Marquis of Falmouth. One brother\nslain in a duel, Master Mervale; one killed in Wyatt's Rebellion; my\nfather dying, and--Heaven rest his soul!--not over-eager to meet his\nMaker. There you have it, Master Mervale,--a right pleasant jest of\nFortune's perpetration,--I a marquis, my own master, fit mate for any\nwoman in the kingdom, and Kate--my Kate who was past human\npraising!--vanished.\"\n\n\"Vanished?\" The lad echoed the word, with wide eyes.\n\n\"Vanished in the night, and no sign nor rumor of her since! Gone to seek\nme abroad, no doubt, poor wench! Dead, dead, beyond question, Master\nMervale!\" The marquis swallowed, and rubbed his lips with the back of his\nhand. \"Ah, well!\" said he; \"it is an old sorrow!\"\n\nThe male animal shaken by strong emotion is to his brothers an\nembarrassing rather than a pathetic sight. Master Mervale, lowering his\neyes discreetly, rooted up several tufts of grass before he spoke. Then,\n\"My lord, you have known of love,\" said he, very slowly; \"does there\nsurvive no kindliness for aspiring lovers in you who have been one of us?\nMy lord of Pevensey, I think, loves the Lady Ursula, at least, as much as\nyou ever loved this Mistress Katherine; of my own adoration I do not\nspeak, save to say that I have sworn never to marry any other woman. Her\nfather favors you, for you are a match in a thousand; but you do not love\nher. It matters little to you, my lord, whom she may wed; to us it\nsignifies a life's happiness. Will not the memory of that Cornish\nlass--the memory of moonlit nights, and of those sweet, vain aspirations\nand foiled day-dreams that in boyhood waked your blood even to such\nbrave folly as now possesses us,--will not the memory of these things\nsoften you, my lord?\"\n\nBut Falmouth by this time appeared half regretful of his recent outburst,\nand somewhat inclined to regard his companion as a dangerously plausible\nyoung fellow who had very unwarrantably wormed himself into Lord\nFalmouth's confidence. Falmouth's heavy jaw shut like a trap.\n\n\"By Saint Gregory!\" said he; \"if ever such notions soften me at all, I\npray to be in hell entirely melted! What I have told you of is past,\nMaster Mervale; and a wise man does not meditate unthriftily upon\nspilt milk.\"\n\n\"You are adamant?\" sighed the boy.\n\n\"The nether millstone,\" said the marquis, smiling grimly, \"is in\ncomparison a pillow of down.\"\n\n\"Yet--yet the milk was sweet, my lord?\" the boy suggested, with a faint\nanswering smile.\n\n\"Sweet!\" The marquis' voice had a deep tremor.\n\n\"And if the choice lay between Ursula and Katherine?\"\n\n\"Oh, fool!--Oh, pink-cheeked, utter ignorant fool!\" the marquis groaned.\n\"Did I not say you knew nothing of love?\"\n\n\"Heigho!\" Master Mervale put aside all glum-faced discussion, with a\nlittle yawn, and sprang to his feet. \"Then we can but hope that\nsomewhere, somehow, Mistress Katherine yet lives and in her own good time\nmay reappear. And while we speak of reappearances--surely the Lady Ursula\nis strangely tardy in making hers?\"\n\nThe marquis' jealousy when it slumbered slept with an open ear. \"Let us\njoin them,\" he said, shortly, and he started through the gardens with\nquick, stiff strides.\n\n\n2. _Song-guerdon_\n\nThey went westward toward the summer pavilion. Presently the marquis\nblundered into the green gloom of the maze, laid out in the Italian\nfashion, and was extricated only by the superior knowledge of Master\nMervale, who guided Falmouth skilfully and surely through manifold\nintricacies, to open daylight.\n\nAfterward they came to a close-shaven lawn, where the summer pavilion\nstood beside the brook that widened here into an artificial pond, spread\nwith lily-pads and fringed with rushes. The Lady Ursula sat with the Earl\nof Pevensey beneath a burgeoning maple-tree. Such rays as sifted through\ninto their cool retreat lay like splotches of wine upon the ground, and\nthere the taller grass-blades turned to needles of thin silver; one\npalpitating beam, more daring than the rest, slanted straight toward the\nlittle head of the Lady Ursula, converting her hair into a halo of misty\ngold, that appeared out of place in this particular position. She seemed\na Bassarid who had somehow fallen heir to an aureole; for otherwise, to\nphrase it sedately, there was about her no clamant suggestion of\nsaintship. At least, there is no record of any saint in the calendar who\never looked with laughing gray-green eyes upon her lover and mocked at\nthe fervor and trepidation of his speech. This the Lady Ursula now did;\nand, manifestly, enjoyed the doing of it.\n\nWithin the moment the Earl of Pevensey took up the viol that lay beside\nthem, and sang to her in the clear morning. He was sunbrowned and very\ncomely, and his big, black eyes were tender as he sang to her sitting\nthere in the shade. He himself sat at her feet in the sunlight.\n\nSang the Earl of Pevensey:\n\n  _\"Ursula, spring wakes about us--\n  Wakes to mock at us and flout us\n  That so coldly do delay:\n  When the very birds are mating,\n  Pray you, why should we be waiting--\n  We that might be wed to-day!\n\n  \"'Life is short,' the wise men tell us;--\n  Even those dusty, musty fellows\n  That have done with life,--and pass\n  Where the wraith of Aristotle\n  Hankers, vainly, for a bottle,\n  Youth and some frank Grecian lass._\n\n  \"Ah, I warrant you;--and Zeno\n  Would not reason, now, could he know\n  One more chance to live and love:\n  For, at best, the merry May-time\n  Is a very fleeting play-time;--\n  Why, then, waste an hour thereof?\n\n  \"Plato, Solon, Periander,\n  Seneca, Anaximander,\n  Pyrrho, and Parmenides!\n  Were one hour alone remaining\n  Would ye spend it in attaining\n  Learning, or to lips like these?\n\n  \"Thus, I demonstrate by reason\n  Now is our predestined season\n  For the garnering of all bliss;\n  Prudence is but long-faced folly;\n  Cry a fig for melancholy!\n  Seal the bargain with a kiss\"_\n\nWhen he had ended, the Earl of Pevensey laughed and looked up into the\nLady Ursula's face with a long, hungry gaze; and the Lady Ursula laughed\nlikewise and spoke kindly to him, though the distance was too great for\nthe eavesdroppers to overhear. Then, after a little, the Lady Ursula bent\nforward, out of the shade of the maple into the sun, so that the sunlight\nfell upon her golden head and glowed in the depths of her hair, as she\nkissed Pevensey, tenderly and without haste, full upon the lips.\n\n\n3. _Falmouth Furens_\n\nThe Marquis of Falmouth caught Master Mervale's arm in a grip that made\nthe boy wince. Lord Falmouth's look was murderous, as he turned in the\nshadow of a white-lilac bush and spoke carefully through sharp breaths\nthat shook his great body.\n\n\"There are,\" said he, \"certain matters I must immediately discuss with my\nlord of Pevensey. I desire you, Master Mervale, to fetch him to the spot\nwhere we parted last, so that we may talk over these matters quietly and\nundisturbed. For else--go, lad, and fetch him!\"\n\nFor a moment the boy faced the half-shut pale eyes that were like coals\nsmouldering behind a veil of gray ash. Then he shrugged his shoulders,\nsauntered forward, and doffed his hat to the Lady Ursula. There followed\nmuch laughter among the three, many explanations from Master Mervale,\nand yet more laughter from the lady and the earl. The marquis ground his\nbig, white teeth as he listened, and he appeared to disapprove of so\nmuch mirth.\n\n\"Foh, the hyenas! the apes, the vile magpies!\" the marquis observed. He\nheaved a sigh of relief, as the Earl of Pevensey, raising his hands\nlightly toward heaven, laughed once more, and departed into the\nthicket. Lord Falmouth laughed in turn, though not very pleasantly.\nAfterward he loosened his sword in the scabbard and wheeled back to seek\ntheir rendezvous in the shadowed place where they had made sonnets to\nthe Lady Ursula.\n\nFor some ten minutes the marquis strode proudly through the maze,\npondering, by the look of him, on the more fatal tricks of fencing. In a\nquarter of an hour he was lost in a wilderness of trim yew-hedges which\nconfronted him stiffly at every outlet and branched off into innumerable\ngravelled alleys that led nowhither.\n\n\"Swounds!\" said the marquis. He retraced his steps impatiently. He cast\nhis hat upon the ground in seething desperation. He turned in a different\ndirection, and in two minutes trod upon his discarded head-gear.\n\n\"Holy Gregory!\" the marquis commented. He meditated for a moment, then\ncaught up his sword close to his side and plunged into the nearest\nhedge. After a little he came out, with a scratched face and a scant\nbreath, into another alley. As the crow flies, he went through the maze\nof Longaville, leaving in his rear desolation and snapped yew-twigs. He\ncame out of the ruin behind the white-lilac bush, where he had stood and\nhad heard the Earl of Pevensey sing to the Lady Ursula, and had seen\nwhat followed.\n\nThe marquis wiped his brow. He looked out over the lawn and breathed\nheavily. The Lady Ursula still sat beneath the maple, and beside her was\nMaster Mervale, whose arm girdled her waist. Her arm was about his neck,\nand she listened as he talked eagerly with many gestures. Then they both\nlaughed and kissed each other.\n\n\"Oh, defend me!\" groaned the marquis. Once more he wiped his brow, as he\ncrouched behind the white-lilac bush. \"Why, the woman is a second\nMessalina!\" he said. \"Oh, the trollop! the wanton! Oh, holy Gregory! Yet\nI must be quiet--quiet as a sucking lamb, that I may strike afterward as\na roaring lion. Is this your innocence, Mistress Ursula, that cannot\nendure the spoken name of a spade? Oh, splendor of God!\"\n\nThus he raged behind the white-lilac bush while they laughed and kissed\nunder the maple-tree. After a space they parted. The Lady Ursula, still\nlaughing, lifted the branches of the rearward thicket and disappeared\nin the path which the Earl of Pevensey had taken. Master Mervale,\nkissing his hand and laughing yet more loudly, lounged toward the\nentrance of the maze.\n\nThe jackanapes (as anybody could see), was in a mood to be pleased with\nhimself. Smiles eddied about the boy's face, his heels skipped,\ndisdaining the honest grass; and presently he broke into a glad little\nsong, all trills and shakes, like that of a bird ecstasizing over the\nperfections of his mate.\n\nSang Master Mervale:\n\n  _\"Listen, all lovers! the spring is here\n  And the world is not amiss;\n  As long as laughter is good to hear,\n  And lips are good to kiss,\n  As long as Youth and Spring endure,\n  There is never an evil past a cure\n  And the world is never amiss.\n\n  \"O lovers all, I bid ye declare\n  The world is a pleasant place;--\n  Give thanks to God for the gift so fair,\n  Give thanks for His singular grace!\n  Give thanks for Youth and Love and Spring!\n  Give thanks, as gentlefolk should, and sing,\n  'The world is a pleasant place!'\"_\n\nIn mid-skip Master Mervale here desisted, his voice trailing into\ninarticulate vowels. After many angry throes, a white-lilac bush had been\ndelivered of the Marquis of Falmouth, who now confronted Master Mervale,\nfuriously moved.\n\n\n4. _Love Rises from un-Cytherean Waters_\n\n\"I have heard, Master Mervale,\" said the marquis, gently, \"that love\nis blind?\"\n\nThe boy stared at the white face, that had before his eyes veiled rage\nwith a crooked smile. So you may see the cat, tense for the fatal spring,\nrelax and with one paw indolently flip the mouse.\n\n\"It is an ancient fable, my lord,\" the boy said, smiling, and made as\nthough to pass.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the marquis, courteously, but without yielding an inch,\n\"it is a very reassuring fable: for,\" he continued, meditatively, \"were\nthe eyes of all lovers suddenly opened, Master Mervale, I suspect it\nwould prove a red hour for the world. There would be both tempers and\nreputations lost, Master Mervale; there would be sword-thrusts; there\nwould be corpses, Master Mervale.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my lord,\" the lad assented, striving to jest and have done;\n\"for all flesh is frail, and as the flesh of woman is frailer than that\nof man, so is it, as I remember to have read, the more easily entrapped\nby the gross snares of the devil, as was over-well proved by the\nserpent's beguiling deceit of Eve at the beginning.\"\n\n\"Yet, Master Mervale,\" pursued the marquis, equably, but without smiling,\n\"there be lovers in the world that have eyes?\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my lord,\" said the boy.\n\n\"There also be women in the world, Master Mervale,\" Lord Falmouth\nsuggested, with a deeper gravity, \"that are but the handsome sepulchres\nof iniquity,--ay, and for the major part of women, those miracles which\nare their bodies, compact of white and gold and sprightly color though\nthey be, serve as the lovely cerements of corruption.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my lord. The devil, as they say, is homelier with that sex.\"\n\n\"There also be swords in the world, Master Mervale?\" purred the marquis.\nHe touched his own sword as he spoke.\n\n\"My lord--!\" the boy cried, with a gasp.\n\n\"Now, swords have at least three uses, Master Mervale,\" Falmouth\ncontinued. \"With a sword one may pick a cork from a bottle; with a sword\none may toast cheese about the Twelfth Night fire; and with a sword one\nmay spit a man, Master Mervale,--ay, even an ambling, pink-faced, lisping\nlad that cannot boo at a goose, Master Mervale. I have no inclination,\nMaster Mervale, just now, for either wine or toasted cheese.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, my lord,\" said the boy, in a thin voice.\n\n\"Indeed, I think we understand each other perfectly,\" said the marquis.\n\"For I have been very frank with you, and I have watched you from behind\nthis bush.\"\n\nThe boy raised his hand as though to speak.\n\n\"Look you, Master Mervale,\" the marquis argued, \"you and my lord of\nPevensey and I be brave fellows; we need a wide world to bustle in. Now,\nthe thought has come to me that this small planet of ours is scarcely\ncommodious enough for all three. There be purgatory and Heaven, and yet\nanother place, Master Mervale; why, then, crowd one another?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said the boy, dully, \"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"Holy Gregory!\" scoffed the marquis; \"surely my meaning is plain enough!\nit is to kill you first, and my lord of Pevensey afterward! Y'are\nphoenixes, Master Mervale, Arabian birds! Y'are too good for this world.\nLongaville is not fit to be trodden under your feet; and therefore it is\nmy intention that you leave Longaville feet first. Draw, Master\nMervale!\" cried the marquis, his light hair falling about his flushed,\nhandsome face as he laughed joyously, and flashed his sword in the\nspring sunshine.\n\nThe boy sprang back, with an inarticulate cry; then gulped some dignity\ninto himself and spoke. \"My lord,\" he said, \"I admit that explanation may\nseem necessary.\"\n\n\"You will render it, if to anybody, Master Mervale, to my heir, who will\ndoubtless accord it such credence as it merits. For my part, having two\nduels on my hands to-day, I have no time to listen to a romance out of\nthe Hundred Merry Tales.\"\n\nFalmouth had placed himself on guard; but Master Mervale stood with\nchattering teeth and irresolute, groping hands, and made no effort to\ndraw. \"Oh, the block! the curd-faced cheat!\" cried the marquis. \"Will\nnothing move you?\" With his left hand he struck at the boy.\n\nThereupon Master Mervale gasped, and turning with a great sob, ran\nthrough the gardens. The marquis laughed discordantly; then he followed,\ntaking big leaps as he ran and flourishing his sword.\n\n\"Oh, the coward!\" he shouted; \"Oh, the milk-livered rogue! Oh, you\npaltry rabbit!\"\n\nSo they came to the bank of the artificial pond. Master Mervale swerved\nas with an oath the marquis pounced at him. Master Mervale's foot caught\nin the root of a great willow, and Master Mervale splashed into ten feet\nof still water, that glistened like quicksilver in the sunlight.\n\n\"Oh, Saint Gregory!\" the marquis cried, and clasped his sides in noisy\nmirth; \"was there no other way to cool your courage? Paddle out and be\nflogged, Master Hare-heels!\" he called. The boy had come to the surface\nand was swimming aimlessly, parallel to the bank. \"Now I have heard,\"\nsaid the marquis, as he walked beside him, \"that water swells a man. Pray\nHeaven, it may swell his heart a thousandfold or so, and thus hearten him\nfor wholesome exercise after his ducking--a friendly thrust or two, a\nlittle judicious bloodletting to ward off the effects of the damp.\"\n\nThe marquis started as Master Mervale grounded on a shallow and rose,\ndripping, knee-deep among the lily-pads. \"Oh, splendor of God!\" cried\nthe marquis.\n\nMaster Mervale had risen from his bath almost clean-shaven; only one\nsodden half of his mustachios clung to his upper lip, and as he rubbed\nthe water from his eyes, this remaining half also fell away from the\nboy's face.\n\n\"Oh, splendor of God!\" groaned the marquis. He splashed noisily into\nthe water. \"O Kate, Kate!\" he cried, his arms about Master Mervale.\n\"Oh, blind, blind, blind! O heart's dearest! Oh, my dear, my dear!\"\nhe observed.\n\nMaster Mervale slipped from his embrace and waded to dry land. \"My\nlord,--\" he began, demurely.\n\n\"My lady wife,--\" said his lordship of Falmouth, with a tremulous smile.\nHe paused, and passed his hand over his brow. \"And yet I do not\nunderstand,\" he said. \"Y'are dead; y'are buried. It was a frightened boy\nI struck.\" He spread out his strong arms. \"O world! O sun! O stars!\" he\ncried; \"she is come back to me from the grave. O little world! small\nshining planet! I think that I could crush you in my hands!\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" Master Mervale suggested, after an interval, \"it is I that\nyou are crushing.\" He sighed,--though not very deeply,--and continued,\nwith a hiatus: \"They would have wedded me to Lucius Rossmore, and I could\nnot--I could not--\"\n\n\"That skinflint! that palsied goat!\" the marquis growled.\n\n\"He was wealthy,\" said Master Mervale. Then he sighed once more. \"There\nseemed only you,--only you in all the world. A man might come to you in\nthose far-off countries: a woman might not. I fled by night, my lord, by\nthe aid of a waiting-woman; became a man by the aid of a tailor; and set\nout to find you by the aid of such impudence as I might muster. But luck\ndid not travel with me. I followed you through Flanders, Italy,\nSpain,--always just too late; always finding the bird flown, the nest yet\nwarm. Presently I heard you were become Marquis of Falmouth; then I gave\nup the quest.\"\n\n\"I would suggest,\" said the marquis, \"that my name is Stephen;--but why,\nin the devil's name, should you give up a quest so laudable?\"\n\n\"Stephen Allonby, my lord,\" said Master Mervale, sadly, \"was not Marquis\nof Falmouth; as Marquis of Falmouth, you might look to mate with any\nwoman short of the Queen.\"\n\n\"To tell you a secret,\" the marquis whispered, \"I look to mate with one\nbeside whom the Queen--not to speak treason--is but a lean-faced, yellow\npiece of affectation. I aim higher than royalty, heart's\ndearest,--aspiring to one beside whom empresses are but common hussies.\"\n\n\"And Ursula?\" asked Master Mervale, gently.\n\n\"Holy Gregory!\" cried the marquis, \"I had forgot! Poor wench, poor wench!\nI must withdraw my suit warily,--firmly, of course, yet very kindlily,\nyou understand, so as to grieve her no more than must be. Poor\nwench!--well, after all,\" he hopefully suggested, \"there is yet\nPevensey.\"\n\n\"O Stephen! Stephen!\" Master Mervale murmured; \"Why, there was never any\nother but Pevensey! For Ursula knows all,--knows there was never any\nmore manhood in Master Mervale's disposition than might be gummed on with\na play-actor's mustachios! Why, she is my cousin, Stephen,--my cousin and\ngood friend, to whom I came at once on reaching England, to find you,\nfavored by her father, pestering her with your suit, and the poor girl\nwell-nigh at her wits' end because she might not have Pevensey. So,\" said\nMaster Mervale, \"we put our heads together, Stephen, as you observe.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" my lord of Falmouth said, \"it would seem that you two wenches\nhave, between you, concocted a very pleasant comedy.\"\n\n\"It was not all a comedy,\" sighed Master Mervale,--\"not all a comedy,\nStephen, until to-day when you told Master Mervale the story of Katherine\nBeaufort. For I did not know--I could not know--\"\n\n\"And now?\" my lord of Falmouth queried.\n\n\"H'm!\" cried Master Mervale, and he tossed his head. \"You are very\nunreasonable in anger! you are a veritable Turk! you struck me!\"\n\nThe marquis rose, bowing low to his former adversary. \"Master Mervale,\"\nsaid the marquis, \"I hereby tender you my unreserved apologies for the\naffront I put upon you. I protest I was vastly mistaken in your\ndisposition and hold you as valorous a gentleman as was ever made by\nbarbers' tricks; and you are at liberty to bestow as many kisses and\ncaresses upon the Lady Ursula as you may elect, reserving, however, a\nreasonable sufficiency for one that shall be nameless. Are we friends,\nMaster Mervale?\"\n\nMaster Mervale rested his head upon Lord Falmouth's shoulder, and sighed\nhappily. Master Mervale laughed,--a low and gentle laugh that was vibrant\nwith content. But Master Mervale said nothing, because there seemed to be\nbetween these two, who were young in the world's recaptured youth, no\nlonger any need of idle speaking.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJUNE 1, 1593\n\n_\"She was the admirablest lady that ever lived: therefore, Master Doctor,\nif you will do us that favor, as to let us see that peerless dame, we\nshould think ourselves much beholding unto you.\"_\n\n\n_There was a double wedding some two weeks later in the chapel at\nLongaville: and each marriage appears to have been happy enough.\n\nThe tenth Marquis of Falmouth had begotten sixteen children within\nseventeen years, at the end of which period his wife unluckily died in\nproducing a final pledge of affection. This child, a daughter, survived,\nand was christened Cynthia: of her you may hear later.\n\nMeanwhile the Earl and the Countess of Pevensey had propagated more\nmoderately; and Pevensey had played a larger part in public life than was\nallotted to Falmouth, who did not shine at Court. Pevensey, indeed, has\nhis sizable niche in history: his Irish expeditions, in 1575, were once\nnotorious, as well as the circumstances of the earl's death in that year\nat Triloch Lenoch. His more famous son, then a boy of eight, succeeded to\nthe title, and somewhat later, as the world knows, to the hazardous\nposition of chief favorite to Queen Elizabeth.\n\n\"For Pevensey has the vision of a poet,\"--thus Langard quotes the lonely\nold Queen,--\"and to balance it, such mathematics as add two and two\ncorrectly, where you others smirk and assure me it sums up to whatever\nthe Queen prefers. I have need of Pevensey: in this parched little age\nall England has need of Pevensey.\"\n\nThat is as it may have been: at all events, it is with this Lord\nPevensey, at the height of his power, that we have now to do._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_The Episode Called Porcelain Cups_\n\n\n1. _Of Greatness Intimately Viewed_\n\n\"Ah, but they are beyond praise,\" said Cynthia Allonby, enraptured, \"and\ncertainly you should have presented them to the Queen.\"\n\n\"Her majesty already possesses a cup of that ware,\" replied Lord\nPevensey. \"It was one of her New Year's gifts, from Robert Cecil. Hers\nis, I believe, not quite so fine as either of yours; but then, they tell\nme, there is not the like of this pair in England, nor indeed on the\nhither side of Cataia.\"\n\nHe set the two pieces of Chinese pottery upon the shelves in the south\ncorner of the room. These cups were of that sea-green tint called\nceladon, with a very wonderful glow and radiance. Such oddities were the\nlast vogue at Court; and Cynthia could not but speculate as to what\nmonstrous sum Lord Pevensey had paid for this his last gift to her.\n\nNow he turned, smiling, a really superb creature in his blue and gold.\n\"I had to-day another message from the Queen--\"\n\n\"George,\" Cynthia said, with fond concern, \"it frightens me to see you\nthus foolhardy, in tempting alike the Queen's anger and the Plague.\"\n\n\"Eh, as goes the Plague, it spares nine out of ten,\" he answered,\nlightly. \"The Queen, I grant you, is another pair of sleeves, for an\nirritated Tudor spares nobody.\"\n\nBut Cynthia Allonby kept silence, and did not exactly smile, while she\nappraised her famous young kinsman. She was flattered by, and a little\nafraid of, the gay self-confidence which led anybody to take such\nchances. Two weeks ago it was that the terrible painted old Queen had\nnamed Lord Pevensey to go straightway into France, where, rumor had it,\nKing Henri was preparing to renounce the Reformed Religion, and making\nhis peace with the Pope: and for two weeks Pevensey had lingered, on one\npretence or another, at his house in London, with the Plague creeping\nabout the city like an invisible incalculable flame, and the Queen asking\nquestions at Windsor. Of all the monarchs that had ever reigned in\nEngland, Elizabeth Tudor was the least used to having her orders\ndisregarded. Meanwhile Lord Pevensey came every day to the Marquis of\nFalmouth's lodgings at Deptford: and every day Lord Pevensey pointed out\nto the marquis' daughter that Pevensey, whose wife had died in childbirth\na year back, did not intend to go into France, for nobody could foretell\nhow long a stay, as a widower. Certainly it was all very flattering....\n\n\"Yes, and you would be an excellent match,\" said Cynthia, aloud, \"if that\nwere all. And yet, what must I reasonably expect in marrying, sir, the\nfamous Earl of Pevensey?\"\n\n\"A great deal of love and petting, my dear. And if there were anything\nelse to which you had a fancy, I would get it for you.\"\n\nHer glance went to those lovely cups and lingered fondly. \"Yes, dear\nMaster Generosity, if it could be purchased or manufactured, you would\nget it for me--\"\n\n\"If it exists I will get it for you,\" he declared.\n\n\"I think that it exists. But I am not learned enough to know what it is.\nGeorge, if I married you I would have money and fine clothes and gilded\ncoaches, and an army of maids and pages, and honor from all men. And you\nwould be kind to me, I know, when you returned from the day's work at\nWindsor--or Holyrood or the Louvre. But do you not see that I would\nalways be to you only a rather costly luxury, like those cups, which the\nQueen's minister could afford to keep for his hours of leisure?\"\n\nHe answered: \"You are all in all to me. You know it. Oh, very well do you\nknow and abuse your power, you adorable and lovely baggage, who have kept\nme dancing attendance for a fortnight, without ever giving me an honest\nyes or no.\" He gesticulated. \"Well, but life is very dull in Deptford\nvillage, and it amuses you to twist a Queen's adviser around your\nfinger! I see it plainly, you minx, and I acquiesce because it delights\nme to give you pleasure, even at the cost of some dignity. Yet I may no\nlonger shirk the Queen's business,--no, not even to amuse you, my dear.\"\n\n\"You said you had heard from her--again?\"\n\n\"I had this morning my orders, under Gloriana's own fair hand, either to\ndepart to-morrow into France or else to come to-morrow to Windsor. I need\nnot say that in the circumstances I consider France the more wholesome.\"\n\nNow the girl's voice was hurt and wistful. \"So, for the thousandth time,\nis it proven the Queen's business means more to you than I do. Yes,\ncertainly it is just as I said, George.\"\n\nHe observed, unruffled: \"My dear, I scent unreason. This is a high\nmatter. If the French King compounds with Rome, it means war for\nProtestant England. Even you must see that.\"\n\nShe replied, sadly: \"Yes, even I! oh, certainly, my lord, even a\nhalf-witted child of seventeen can perceive as much as that.\"\n\n\"I was not speaking of half-witted persons, as I remember. Well, it\nchances that I am honored by the friendship of our gallant Bearnais, and\nam supposed to have some claim upon him, thanks to my good fortune last\nyear in saving his life from the assassin Barriere. It chances that I may\nperhaps become, under providence, the instrument of preserving my fellow\ncountrymen from much grief and trumpet-sounding and throat-cutting.\nInstead of pursuing that chance, two weeks ago--as was my duty--I have\ndangled at your apron-strings, in the vain hope of softening the most\nvariable and hardest heart in the world. Now, clearly, I have not the\nright to do that any longer.\"\n\nShe admired the ennobled, the slightly rapt look which, she knew, denoted\nthat George Bulmer was doing his duty as he saw it, even in her\ndisappointment. \"No, you have not the right. You are wedded to your\nstatecraft, to your patriotism, to your self-advancement, or christen it\nwhat you will. You are wedded, at all events, to your man's business. You\nhave not the time for such trifles as giving a maid that foolish and\nlovely sort of wooing to which every maid looks forward in her heart of\nhearts. Indeed, when you married the first time it was a kind of\ninfidelity; and I am certain that poor, dear mouse-like Mary must have\nfelt that often and over again. Why, do you not see, George, even now,\nthat your wife will always come second to your real love?\"\n\n\"In my heart, dear sophist, you will always come first. But it is not\npermitted that any loyal gentleman devote every hour of his life to\nsighing and making sonnets, and to the general solacing of a maid's\nloneliness in this dull little Deptford. Nor would you, I am sure, desire\nme to do so.\"\n\n\"I hardly know what I desire,\" she told him ruefully. \"But I know that\nwhen you talk of your man's business I am lonely and chilled and far\naway from you. And I know that I cannot understand more than half your\nfine high notions about duty and patriotism and serving England and so\non,\" the girl declared: and she flung wide her lovely little hands, in a\ndespairing gesture. \"I admire you, sir, when you talk of England. It\nmakes you handsomer--yes, even handsomer!--somehow. But all the while I\nam remembering that England is just an ordinary island inhabited by a\nnumber of ordinary persons, for the most of whom I have no particular\nfeeling one way or the other.\"\n\nPevensey looked down at her for a while with queer tenderness. Then he\nsmiled. \"No, I could not quite make you understand, my dear. But, ah, why\nfuddle that quaint little brain by trying to understand such matters as\nlie without your realm? For a woman's kingdom is the home, my dear, and\nher throne is in the heart of her husband--\"\n\n\"All this is but another way of saying your lordship would have us cups\nupon a shelf,\" she pointed out--\"in readiness for your leisure.\"\n\nHe shrugged, said \"Nonsense!\" and began more lightly to talk of other\nmatters. Thus and thus he would do in France, such and such trinkets\nhe would fetch back--\"as toys for the most whimsical, the loveliest,\nand the most obstinate child in all the world,\" he phrased it. And\nthey would be married, Pevensey declared, in September: nor (he gaily\nsaid) did he propose to have any further argument about it. Children\nshould be seen--the proverb was dusty, but it particularly applied to\npretty children.\n\nCynthia let him talk. She was just a little afraid of his\nself-confidence, and of this tall nobleman's habit of getting what he\nwanted, in the end: but she dispiritedly felt that Pevensey had failed\nher. Why, George Bulmer treated her as if she were a silly infant; and\nhis want of her, even in that capacity, was a secondary matter: he was\ngoing into France, for all his petting talk, and was leaving her to shift\nas she best might, until he could spare the time to resume his\nlove-making....\n\n\n2. _What Comes of Scribbling_\n\nNow when Pevensey had gone the room seemed darkened by the withdrawal of\nso much magnificence. Cynthia watched from the window as the tall earl\nrode away, with three handsomely clad retainers. Yes, George was very\nfine and admirable, no doubt of it: even so, there was relief in the\nreflection that for a month or two she was rid of him.\n\nTurning, she faced a lean, dishevelled man, who stood by the Magdalen\ntapestry scratching his chin. He had unquiet bright eyes, this\nout-at-elbows poet whom a marquis' daughter was pleased to patronize, and\nhis red hair was unpardonably tousled. Nor were his manners beyond\nreproach, for now, without saying anything, he, too, went to the window.\nHe dragged one foot a little as he walked.\n\n\"So my lord Pevensey departs! Look how he rides in triumph! like lame\nTamburlaine, with Techelles and Usumcasane and Theridamas to attend him,\nand with the sunset turning the dust raised by their horses' hoofs into a\nsort of golden haze about them. It is a beautiful world. And truly,\nMistress Cyn,\" the poet said, reflectively, \"that Pevensey is a very\nsplendid ephemera. If not a king himself, at least he goes magnificently\nto settle the affairs of kings. Were modesty not my failing, Mistress\nCyn, I would acclaim you as strangely lucky, in being beloved by two fine\nfellows that have not their like in England.\"\n\n\"Truly, you are not always thus modest, Kit Marlowe--\"\n\n\"But, Lord, how seriously Pevensey takes it all! and takes himself in\nparticular! Why, there departs from us, in befitting state, a personage\nwhose opinion as to every topic in the world is written legibly in the\ncarriage of those fine shoulders, even when seen from behind and from so\nconsiderable a distance. And in not one syllable do any of these opinions\ndiffer from the opinions of his great-great-grandfathers. Oho, and hark\nto Deptford! now all the oafs in the Corn-market are cheering this\nbulwark of Protestant England, this rising young hero of a people with no\nnonsense about them. Yes, it is a very quaint and rather splendid\nephemera.\"\n\nThe daughter of a marquis could not quite approve of the way in which\nthis shoemaker's son, however talented, railed at his betters. \"Pevensey\nwill be the greatest man in these kingdoms some day. Indeed, Kit Marlowe,\nthere are those who say he is that much already.\"\n\n\"Oh, very probably! Still, I am puzzled by human greatness. A century\nhence what will he matter, this Pevensey? His ascent and his declension\nwill have been completed, and his foolish battles and treaties will have\ngiven place to other foolish battles and treaties, and oblivion will have\nswallowed this glistening bluebottle, plumes and fine lace and stately\nruff and all. Why, he is but an adviser to the queen of half an island,\nwhereas my Tamburlaine was lord of all the golden ancient East: and what\ndoes my Tamburlaine matter now, save that he gave Kit Marlowe the subject\nof a drama? Hah, softly though! for does even that very greatly matter?\nWho really cares to-day about what scratches were made upon wax by that\nold Euripides, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to unloose?\nNo, not quite worthy, as yet!\"\n\nAnd thereupon the shabby fellow sat down in the tall leather-covered\nchair which Pevensey had just vacated: and this Marlowe nodded his\nflaming head portentously. \"Hoh, look you, I am displeased, Mistress Cyn,\nI cannot lend my approval to this over-greedy oblivion that gapes for\nall. No, it is not a satisfying arrangement, that I should teeter\ninsecurely through the void on a gob of mud, and be expected by and by to\nrelinquish even that crazy foothold. Even for Kit Marlowe death lies in\nwait! and it may be, not anything more after death, not even any lovely\nwords to play with. Yes, and this Marlowe may amount to nothing, after\nall: and his one chance of amounting to that which he intends may be\ntaken away from him at any moment!\"\n\nHe touched the breast of a weather-beaten doublet. He gave her that queer\ntwisted sort of smile which the girl could not but find attractive,\nsomehow. He said: \"Why, but this heart thumping here inside me may stop\nany moment like a broken clock. Here is Euripides writing better than I:\nand here in my body, under my hand, is the mechanism upon which depend\nall those masterpieces that are to blot the Athenian from the reckoning,\nand I have no control of it!\"\n\n\"Indeed, I fear that you control few things,\" she told him, \"and that\nleast of all do you control your taste for taverns and bad women. Oh, I\nhear tales of you!\" And Cynthia raised a reproving forefinger.\n\n\"True tales, no doubt.\" He shrugged. \"Lacking the moon he vainly cried\nfor, the child learns to content himself with a penny whistle.\"\n\n\"Ah, but the moon is far away,\" the girl said, smiling--\"too far to hear\nthe sound of human crying: and besides, the moon, as I remember it, was\nnever a very amorous goddess--\"\n\n\"Just so,\" he answered: \"also she was called Cynthia, and she, too, was\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"Yet is it the heart that cries to me, my poet?\" she asked him, softly,\n\"or just the lips?\"\n\n\"Oh, both of them, most beautiful and inaccessible of goddesses.\" Then\nMarlowe leaned toward her, laughing and shaking that disreputable red\nhead. \"Still, you are very foolish, in your latest incarnation, to be\nwasting your rays upon carpet earls who will not outwear a century. Were\nmodesty not my failing, I repeat, I could name somebody who will last\nlonger. Yes, and--if but I lacked that plaguey virtue--I would advise you\nto go a-gypsying with that nameless somebody, so that two manikins might\nsnatch their little share of the big things that are eternal, just as the\nbutterfly fares intrepidly and joyously, with the sun for his torchboy,\nthrough a universe wherein thought cannot estimate the unimportance of a\nbutterfly, and wherein not even the chaste moon is very important. Yes,\ncertainly I would advise you to have done with this vanity of courts and\nmasques, of satins and fans and fiddles, this dallying with tinsels and\nbright vapors; and very movingly I would exhort you to seek out Arcadia,\ntravelling hand in hand with that still nameless somebody.\" And of a\nsudden the restless man began to sing.\n\nSang Kit Marlowe:\n\n  _\"Come live with me and be my love,\n  And we will all the pleasures prove\n  That hills and valleys, dales and fields,\n  Woods or steepy mountain yields.\n\n  \"And we will sit upon the rocks,\n  And see the shepherds feed their flocks\n  By shallow rivers, to whose falls\n  Melodious birds sing madrigals--\"_\n\nBut the girl shook her small, wise head decisively. \"That is all very\nfine, but, as it happens, there is no such place as this Arcadia, where\npeople can frolic in perpetual sunlight the year round, and find their\nfood and clothing miraculously provided. No, nor can you, I am afraid,\ngive me what all maids really, in their heart of hearts, desire far more\nthan any sugar-candy Arcadia. Oh, as I have so often told you, Kit, I\nthink you love no woman. You love words. And your seraglio is tenanted by\nvery beautiful words, I grant you, though there is no longer any Sestos\nbuilded of agate and crystal, either, Kit Marlowe. For, as you may\nperceive, sir, I have read all that lovely poem you left with me last\nThursday--\"\n\nShe saw how interested he was, saw how he almost smirked. \"Aha, so you\nthink it not quite bad, eh, the conclusion of my _Hero and Leander_?\"\n\n\"It is your best. And your middlemost, my poet, is better than aught else\nin English,\" she said, politely, and knowing how much he delighted to\nhear such remarks.\n\n\"Come, I retract my charge of foolishness, for you are plainly a wench\nof rare discrimination. And yet you say I do not love you! Cynthia, you\nare beautiful, you are perfect in all things. You are that heavenly\nHelen of whom I wrote, some persons say, acceptably enough. How strange\nit was I did not know that Helen was dark-haired and pale! for certainly\nyours is that immortal loveliness which must be served by poets in life\nand death.\"\n\n\"And I wonder how much of these ardors,\" she thought, \"is kindled by my\npraise of his verses?\" She bit her lip, and she regarded him with a hint\nof sadness. She said, aloud: \"But I did not, after all, speak to Lord\nPevensey concerning the printing of your poem. Instead, I burned your\n_Hero and Leander_.\"\n\nShe saw him jump, as under a whip-lash. Then he smiled again, in that wry\nfashion of his. \"I lament the loss to letters, for it was my only copy.\nBut you knew that.\"\n\n\"Yes, Kit, I knew it was your only copy.\"\n\n\"Oho! and for what reason did you burn it, may one ask?\"\n\n\"I thought you loved it more than you loved me. It was my rival, I\nthought--\" The girl was conscious of remorse, and yet it was remorse\ncommingled with a mounting joy.\n\n\"And so you thought a jingle scribbled upon a bit of paper could be your\nrival with me!\"\n\nThen Cynthia no longer doubted, but gave a joyous little sobbing\nlaugh, for the love of her disreputable dear poet was sustaining the\nstringent testing she had devised. She touched his freckled hand\ncaressingly, and her face was as no man had ever seen it, and her\nvoice, too, caressed him.\n\n\"Ah, you have made me the happiest of women, Kit! Kit, I am almost\ndisappointed in you, though, that you do not grieve more for the loss of\nthat beautiful poem.\"\n\nHis smiling did not waver; yet the lean, red-haired man stayed\nmotionless. \"Why, but see how lightly I take the destruction of my\nlife-work in this, my masterpiece! For I can assure you it was a\nmasterpiece, the fruit of two years' toil and of much loving\nrepolishment--\"\n\n\"Ah, but you love me better than such matters, do you not?\" she asked\nhim, tenderly. \"Kit Marlowe, I adore you! Sweetheart, do you not\nunderstand that a woman wants to be loved utterly and entirely? She wants\nno rivals, not even paper rivals. And so often when you talked of poetry\nI have felt lonely and chilled and far away from you, and I have been\nhalf envious, dear, of your Heros and Helens and your other\ngood-for-nothing Greek minxes. But now I do not mind them at all. And I\nwill make amends, quite prodigal amends, for my naughty jealousy: and my\npoet shall write me some more lovely poems, so he shall--\"\n\nHe said: \"You fool!\"\n\nAnd she drew away from him, for this man was no longer smiling.\n\n\"You burned my _Hero and Leander_! You! you big-eyed fool! You lisping\nidiot! you wriggling, cuddling worm! you silken bag of guts! had not even\nyou the wit to perceive it was immortal beauty which would have lived\nlong after you and I were stinking dirt? And you, a half-witted animal, a\nshining, chattering parrot, lay claws to it!\" Marlowe had risen in a sort\nof seizure, in a condition which was really quite unreasonable when you\nconsidered that only a poem was at stake, even a rather long poem.\n\nAnd Cynthia began to smile, with tremulous hurt-looking young lips. \"So\nmy poet's love is very much the same as Pevensey's love! And I was right,\nafter all.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Marlowe, \"that ever a poet should love a woman! What jokes\ndoes the lewd flesh contrive!\" Of a sudden he was calmer; and then rage\nfell away from him like a dropped cloak, and he viewed her as with\nrespectful wonder. \"Why, but you sitting there, with goggling innocent\nbright eyes, are an allegory of all that is most droll and tragic. Yes,\nand indeed there is no reason to blame you. It is not your fault that\nevery now and then is born a man who serves an idea which is to him the\nmost important thing in the world. It is not your fault that this man\nperforce inhabits a body to which the most important thing in the world\nis a woman. Certainly it is not your fault that this compost makes yet\nanother jumble of his two desires, and persuades himself that the two are\nsomehow allied. The woman inspires, the woman uplifts, the woman\nstrengthens him for his high work, saith he! Well, well, perhaps there\nare such women, but by land and sea I have encountered none of them.\"\n\nAll this was said while Marlowe shuffled about the room, with bent\nshoulders, and nodding his tousled red head, and limping as he walked.\nNow Marlowe turned, futile and shabby looking, just where a while ago\nLord Pevensey had loomed resplendent. Again she saw the poet's queer,\ntwisted, jeering smile.\n\n\"What do you care for my ideals? What do you care for the ideals of that\ntall earl whom for a fortnight you have held from his proper business? or\nfor the ideals of any man alive? Why, not one thread of that dark hair,\nnot one snap of those white little fingers, except when ideals irritate\nyou by distracting a man's attention from Cynthia Allonby. Otherwise, he\nis welcome enough to play with his incomprehensible toys.\"\n\nHe jerked a thumb toward the shelves behind him.\n\n\"Oho, you virtuous pretty ladies! what all you value is such matters as\nthose cups: they please the eye, they are worth sound money, and people\nenvy you the possession of them. So you cherish your shiny mud cups, and\nyou burn my _Hero and Leander_: and I declaim all this dull nonsense over\nthe ashes of my ruined dreams, thinking at bottom of how pretty you are,\nand of how much I would like to kiss you. That is the real tragedy, the\nimmemorial tragedy, that I should still hanker after you, my Cynthia--\"\n\nHis voice dwelt tenderly upon her name. His fever-haunted eyes were\ntender, too, for just a moment. Then he grimaced.\n\n\"No, I was wrong--the tragedy strikes deeper. The root of it is that\nthere is in you and in all your glittering kind no malice, no will to do\nharm nor to hurt anything, but just a bland and invincible and, upon the\nwhole, a well-meaning stupidity, informing a bright and soft and\ndelicately scented animal. So you work ruin among those men who serve\nideals, not foreplanning ruin, not desiring to ruin anything, not even\nhaving sufficient wit to perceive the ruin when it is accomplished. You\nare, when all is done, not even detestable, not even a worthy peg whereon\nto hang denunciatory sonnets, you shallow-pated pretty creatures whom\npoets--oh, and in youth all men are poets!--whom poets, now and always,\nare doomed to hanker after to the detriment of their poesy. No, I concede\nit: you kill without pre-meditation, and without ever suspecting your\nhands to be anything but stainless. So in logic I must retract all my\nharsh words; and I must, without any hint of reproach, endeavor to bid\nyou a somewhat more civil farewell.\"\n\nShe had regarded him, throughout this preposterous and uncalled-for\nharangue, with sad composure, with a forgiving pity. Now she asked him,\nvery quietly, \"Where are you going, Kit?\"\n\n\"To the Golden Hind, O gentle, patient and unjustly persecuted virgin\nmartyr!\" he answered, with an exaggerated bow--\"since that is the part in\nwhich you now elect to posture.\"\n\n\"Not to that low, vile place again!\"\n\n\"But certainly I intend in that tavern to get tipsy as quickly as\npossible: for then the first woman I see will for the time become the\nwoman whom I desire, and who exists nowhere.\" And with that the\nred-haired man departed, limping and singing as he went to look for a\ntrull in a pot-house.\n\nSang Kit Marlowe:\n\n  _\"And I will make her beds of roses\n  And a thousand fragrant posies;\n  A cap of flowers, and a kirtle\n  Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle.\n\n  \"A gown made of the finest wool\n  Which from our pretty lambs we pull;\n  Fair-lined slippers for the cold,\n  With buckles of the purest gold--\"_\n\n\n3. _Economics of Egeria_\n\nShe sat quite still when Marlowe had gone.\n\n\"He will get drunk again,\" she thought despondently. \"Well, and why\nshould it matter to me if he does, after all that outrageous ranting? He\nhas been unforgivably insulting--Oh, but none the less, I do not want to\nhave him babbling of the roses and gold of that impossible fairy world\nwhich the poor, frantic child really believes in, to some painted woman\nof the town who will laugh at him. I loathe the thought of her laughing\nat him--and kissing him! His notions are wild foolishness; but I at least\nwish that they were not foolishness, and that hateful woman will not care\none way or the other.\"\n\nSo Cynthia sighed, and to comfort her forlorn condition fetched a\nhand-mirror from the shelves whereon glowed her green cups. She touched\neach cup caressingly in passing; and that which she found in the mirror,\ntoo, she regarded not unappreciatively, from varying angles.... Yes,\nafter all, dark hair and a pale skin had their advantages at a court\nwhere pink and yellow women were so much the fashion as to be common. Men\nremembered you more distinctively.\n\nThough nobody cared for men, in view of their unreasonable behavior, and\ntheir absolute self-centeredness.... Oh, it was pitiable, it was\ngrotesque, she reflected sadly, how Pevensey and Kit Marlowe had both\nfailed her, after so many pretty speeches.\n\nStill, there was a queer pleasure in being wooed by Kit: his insane\nnotions went to one's head like wine. She would send Meg for him again\nto-morrow. And Pevensey was, of course, the best match imaginable.... No,\nit would be too heartless to dismiss George Buhner outright. It was\nunreasonable of him to desert her because a Gascon threatened to go to\nmass: but, after all, she would probably marry George, in the end. He\nwas really almost unendurably silly, though, about England and freedom\nand religion and right and wrong and things like that. Yes, it would be\ntedious to have a husband who often talked to you as though he were\naddressing a public assemblage.... Yet, he was very handsome,\nparticularly in his highflown and most tedious moments; that year-old son\nof his was sickly, and would probably die soon, the sweet forlorn little\npet, and not be a bother to anybody: and her dear old father would be\nprofoundly delighted by the marriage of his daughter to a man whose wife\ncould have at will a dozen c\u00e9ladon cups, and anything else she chose to\nask for....\n\nBut now the sun had set, and the room was growing quite dark. So Cynthia\nstood a-tiptoe, and replaced the mirror upon the shelves, setting it\nupright behind those wonderful green cups which had anew reminded her of\nPevensey's wealth and generosity. She smiled a little, to think of what\nfun it had been to hold George back, for two whole weeks, from\ndischarging that horrible old queen's stupid errands.\n\n\n4. _Treats Philosophically of Breakage_\n\nThe door opened. Stalwart young Captain Edward Musgrave came with a\nlighted candle, which he placed carefully upon the table in the\nroom's centre.\n\nHe said: \"They told me you were here. I come from London. I bring\nnews for you.\"\n\n\"You bring no pleasant tidings, I fear--\"\n\n\"As Lord Pevensey rode through the Strand this afternoon, on his way\nhome, the Plague smote him. That is my sad news. I grieve to bring such\nnews, for your cousin was a worthy gentleman and universally respected.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Cynthia said, very quiet, \"so Pevensey is dead. But the Plague\nkills quickly!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is a comfort, certainly. Yes, he turned quite black in\nthe face, they report, and before his men could reach him had fallen from\nhis horse. It was all over almost instantly. I saw him afterward, hardly\na pleasant sight. I came to you as soon as I could. I was vexatiously\ndetained--\"\n\n\"So George Bulmer is dead, in a London gutter! It seems strange,\nbecause he was here, befriended by monarchs, and very strong and\nhandsome and self-confident, hardly two hours ago. Is that his blood\nupon your sleeve?\"\n\n\"But of course not! I told you I was vexatiously detained, almost at your\ngates. Yes, I had the ill luck to blunder into a disgusting business. The\ntwo rapscallions tumbled out of a doorway under my horse's very nose,\negad! It was a near thing I did not ride them down. So I stopped,\nnaturally. I regretted stopping, afterward, for I was too late to be of\nhelp. It was at the Golden Hind, of course. Something really ought to be\ndone about that place. Yes, and that rogue Marler bled all over a new\ndoublet, as you see. And the Deptford constables held me with their\nfoolish interrogatories--\"\n\n\"So one of the fighting men was named Marlowe! Is he dead, too, dead in\nanother gutter?\"\n\n\"Marlowe or Marler, or something of the sort--wrote plays and sonnets and\nsuch stuff, they tell me. I do not know anything about him--though, I\ngive you my word, now, those greasy constables treated me as though I\nwere a noted frequenter of pot-houses. That sort of thing is most\nannoying. At all events, he was drunk as David's sow, and squabbling\nover, saving your presence, a woman of the sort one looks to find in that\nabominable hole. And so, as I was saying, this other drunken rascal dug a\nknife into him--\"\n\nBut now, to Captain Musgrave's discomfort, Cynthia Allonby had begun to\nweep heartbrokenly.\n\nSo he cleared his throat, and he patted the back of her hand. \"It is a\ngreat shock to you, naturally--oh, most naturally, and does you great\ncredit. But come now, Pevensey is gone, as we must all go some day, and\nour tears cannot bring him back, my dear. We can but hope he is better\noff, poor fellow, and look on it as a mysterious dispensation and that\nsort of thing, my dear--\"\n\n\"Oh, Ned, but people are so cruel! People will be saying that it was I\nwho kept poor Cousin George in London this past two weeks, and that but\nfor me he would have been in France long ago! And then the Queen,\nNed!--why, that pig-headed old woman will be blaming it on me, that\nthere is nobody to prevent that detestable French King from turning\nCatholic and dragging England into new wars, and I shall not be able to\ngo to any of the Court dances! nor to the masques!\" sobbed Cynthia, \"nor\nanywhere!\"\n\n\"Now you talk tender-hearted and angelic nonsense. It is noble of you to\nfeel that way, of course. But Pevensey did not take proper care of\nhimself, and that is all there is to it. Now I have remained in London\nsince the Plague's outbreak. I stayed with my regiment, naturally. We\nhave had a few deaths, of course. People die everywhere. But the Plague\nhas never bothered me. And why has it never bothered me? Simply because I\nwas sensible, took the pains to consult an astrologer, and by his advice\nwear about my neck, night and day, a bag containing tablets of toads'\nblood and arsenic. It is an infallible specific for men born in February.\nNo, not for a moment do I wish to speak harshly of the dead, but sensible\npersons cannot but consider Lord Pevensey's death to have been caused by\nhis own carelessness.\"\n\n\"Now, certainly that is true,\" the girl said, brightening. \"It was really\nhis own carelessness and his dear lovable rashness. And somebody could\nexplain it to the Queen. Besides, I often think that wars are good for\nthe public spirit of a nation, and bring out its true manhood. But then\nit upset me, too, a little, Ned, to hear about this Marlowe--for I must\ntell you that I knew the poor man, very slightly. So I happen to know\nthat to-day he flung off in a rage, and began drinking, because somebody,\nalmost by pure chance, had burned a packet of his verses--\"\n\nThereupon Captain Musgrave raised heavy eyebrows, and guffawed so\nheartily that the candle flickered. \"To think of the fellow's putting it\non that plea! when he could so easily have written some more verses. That\nis the trouble with these poets, if you ask me: they are not practical\neven in their ordinary everyday lying. No, no, the truth of it was that\nthe rogue wanted a pretext for making a beast of himself, and seized the\nfirst that came to hand. Egad, my dear, it is a daily practise with these\npoets. They hardly draw a sober breath. Everybody knows that.\"\n\nCynthia was looking at him in the half-lit room with very flattering\nadmiration.... Seen thus, with her scarlet lips a little\nparted--disclosing pearls,--and with her naive dark eyes aglow, she was\nquite incredibly pretty and caressable. She had almost forgotten until\nnow that this stalwart soldier, too, was in love with her. But now her\nspirits were rising venturously, and she knew that she liked Ned\nMusgrave. He had sensible notions; he saw things as they really were, and\nwith him there would never be any nonsense about toplofty ideas. Then,\ntoo, her dear old white-haired father would be pleased, because there was\na very fair estate....\n\nSo Cynthia said: \"I believe you are right, Ned. I often wonder how they\ncan be so lacking in self-respect. Oh, I am certain you must be right,\nfor it is just what I felt without being able quite to express it. You\nwill stay for supper with us, of course. Yes, but you must, because it is\nalways a great comfort for me to talk with really sensible persons. I do\nnot wonder that you are not very eager to stay, though, for I am probably\na fright, with my eyes red, and with my hair all tumbling down, like an\nold witch's. Well, let us see what can be done about it, sir! There was a\nhand-mirror--\"\n\nAnd thus speaking, she tripped, with very much the reputed grace of a\nfairy, toward the far end of the room, and standing a-tiptoe, groped at\nthe obscure shelves, with a resultant crash of falling china.\n\n\"Oh, but my lovely cups!\" said Cynthia, in dismay. \"I had forgotten they\nwere up there: and now I have smashed both of them, in looking for my\nmirror, sir, and trying to prettify myself for you. And I had so fancied\nthem, because they had not their like in England!\"\n\nShe looked at the fragments, and then at Musgrave, with wide, innocent\nhurt eyes. She was really grieved by the loss of her quaint toys. But\nMusgrave, in his sturdy, common-sense way, only laughed at her\nseriousness over such kickshaws.\n\n\"I am for an honest earthenware tankard myself!\" he said, jovially, as\nthe two went in to supper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n1905-1919\n\n_\"Tell me where is fancy bred Or in the heart or in the head? How begot,\nhow nourished?... Then let us all ring fancy's knell.\"_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_The Envoi Called Semper Idem_\n\n\n1. _Which Baulks at an Estranging Sea_\n\nHere, then, let us end the lovers' comedy, after a good precedent, with\nsupper as the denouement. _Chacun ira souper: la com\u00e9die ne peut pas\nmieux finir._\n\nFor epilogue, Cynthia Allonby was duly married to Edward Musgrave, and he\nmade her a fair husband, as husbands go. That was the upshot of\nPevensey's death and Marlowe's murder: as indeed, it was the outcome of\nall the earlier-recorded heart-burnings and endeavors and spoiled dreams.\nThrough generation by generation, traversing just three centuries, I have\nexplained to you, my dear Mrs. Grundy, how divers weddings came about:\nand each marriage appears, upon the whole, to have resulted\nsatisfactorily. Dame Melicent and Dame Adelaide, not Florian, touched the\nroot of the matter as they talked together at Storisende: and the trio's\ndescendants could probe no deeper.\n\nBut now we reach the annals of the house of Musgrave: and further\nadventuring is blocked by R. V. Musgrave's monumental work _The Musgraves\nof Matocton_. The critical may differ as to the plausibility of the\nfamily tradition (ably defended by Colonel Musgrave, pp. 33-41) that\nMistress Cynthia Musgrave was the dark lady of Shakespeare's Sonnets, and\nthat this poet, also, in the end, absolved her of intentional malice.\nThere is none, at any event, but may find in this genealogical classic a\nfull record of the highly improbable happenings which led to the\nemigration of Captain Edward Musgrave, and later of Cynthia Musgrave, to\nthe Colony of Virginia; and none but must admire Colonel Musgrave's\npainstaking and accurate tracing of the American Musgraves who descended\nfrom this couple, down to the eve of the twentieth century.\n\nIt would be supererogatory, therefore, for me to tell you of the various\nMusgrave marriages, and to re-dish such data as is readily accessible on\nthe reference shelves of the nearest public library, as well as in the\narchives of the Colonial Dames, of the Society of the Cincinnati, and of\nthe Sons and Daughters of various wars. It suffices that from the\nmarriage of Edward Musgrave and Cynthia Allonby sprang this well-known\nAmerican family, prolific of brave gentlemen and gracious ladies who in\ndue course, and in new lands, achieved their allotted portion of laughter\nand anguish and compromise, very much as their European fathers and\nmothers had done aforetime.\n\nSo I desist to follow the line of love across the Atlantic; and, for the\nwhile at least, make an end of these chronicles. My pen flags, my ink\nruns low, and (since Florian wedded twice) the Dizain of Marriages is\ncompleted.\n\n\n2. _Which Defers to Various Illusions_\n\nI have bound up my gleanings from the fields of old years into a modest\nsheaf; and if it be so fortunate as to please you, my dear Mrs.\nGrundy,--if it so come about that your ladyship be moved in time to\ndesire another sheaf such as this,--why, assuredly, my surprise will be\nuntempered with obduracy. The legends of Allonby have been but lightly\ntouched upon: and apart from the _Aventures d'Adhelmar_, Nicolas de Caen\nis thus far represented in English only by the _Roi Atnaury_ (which, to\nbe sure, is Nicolas' masterpiece) and the mutilated _Dizain des Reines_\nand the fragmentary _Roman de Lusignan_.\n\nBut since you, madam, are not Schahriah, to give respite for the sake of\nan unnarrated tale, I must now without further peroration make an end.\nThrough the monstrous tapestry I have traced out for you the windings of\na single thread, and I entreat you, dear lady, to accept it with\nassurances of my most distinguished regard.\n\nAnd if the offering be no great gift, this lack of greatness, believe me,\nis due to the errors and limitations of the transcriber alone.\n\nFor they loved greatly, these men and women of the past, in that rapt\nhour wherein Nature tricked them to noble ends, and lured them to skyey\nheights of adoration and sacrifice. At bottom they were, perhaps, no more\nheroical than you or I. Indeed, neither Florian nor Adhelmar was at\nstrict pains to act as common-sense dictated, and Falstaff is scarcely\ndescribable as immaculate: Villon thieved, Kit Marlowe left a wake of\nemptied bottles, and Will Sommers was notoriously a fool; Matthiette was\nvain, and Adelais self-seeking, and the tenth Marquis of Falmouth, if you\npress me, rather a stupid and pompous ass: and yet to each in turn it was\ngranted to love greatly, to know at least one hour of magnanimity when\neach was young in the world's annually recaptured youth.\n\nAnd if that hour did not ever have its sequel in precisely the\nanticipated life-long rapture, nor always in a wedding with the person\npreferred, yet since at any rate it resulted in a marriage that turned\nout well enough, in a world wherein people have to consider expediency,\none may rationally assert that each of these romances ended happily.\nBesides, there had been the hour.\n\nAh, yes, this love is an illusion, if you will. Wise men have protested\nthat vehemently enough in all conscience. But there are two ends to every\nstickler for his opinion here. Whether you see, in this fleet hour's\nabandonment to love, the man's spark of divinity flaring in momentary\nsplendor,--a tragic candle, with divinity guttering and half-choked among\nthe drossier particles, and with momentary splendor lighting man's\nsimilitude to Him in Whose likeness man was created,--or whether you,\nmore modernly, detect as prompting this surrender coarse-fibred Nature,\nin the Prince of Lycia's role (with all mankind her Troiluses to be\ncajoled into perpetuation of mankind), you have, in either event,\nconceded that to live unbefooled by love is at best a shuffling and\ndebt-dodging business, and you have granted this unreasoned, transitory\nsurrender to be the most high and, indeed, the one requisite action which\nliving affords.\n\nBeyond that is silence. If you succeed in proving love a species of\nmadness, you have but demonstrated that there is something more\nprofoundly pivotal than sanity, and for the sanest logician this is a\ndisastrous gambit: whereas if, in well-nigh obsolete fashion, you confess\nthe universe to be a weightier matter than the contents of your skull,\nand your wits a somewhat slender instrument wherewith to plumb\ninfinity,--why, then you will recall that it is written _God is love_,\nand this recollection, too, is conducive to a fine taciturnity.\n\n\nEXPLICIT LINEA AMORIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Line of Love, by James Branch Cabell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LINE OF LOVE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9488-8.txt or 9488-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/9/4/8/9488/\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Mary Meehan and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
