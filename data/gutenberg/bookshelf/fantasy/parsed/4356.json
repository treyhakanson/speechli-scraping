Cap'n Bill is also a new character who seems\nto have won approval, and so both Trot and the old sailor are again\nintroduced in the present story, which may be called the second of the\nseries of adventures of Trot and Cap'n Bill.\n\nBut you will recognize some other acquaintances in \"Sky Island.\" Here,\nfor instance, is Button-Bright, who once had an adventure with Dorothy\nin Oz, and without Button-Bright and his Magic Umbrella you will see\nthat the story of \"Sky Island\" could never have been written. As\nPolychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter, lives in the sky, it is natural\nthat Trot and Button-Bright meet her during their adventures there.\n\nThis story of Sky Island has astonished me considerably, and I think it\nwill also astonish you. The sky country is certainly a remarkable fair\nland, but after reading about it I am sure you will agree with me that\nour old Mother Earth is a very good place to live upon and that Trot\nand Button-Bright and Cap'n Bill were fortunate to get back to it again.\n\nBy the way, one of my little correspondents has suggested that I print\nmy address in this book, so that the children may know where letters\nwill reach me. I am doing this, as you see, and hope that many will\nwrite to me and tell me how they like \"Sky Island.\" My greatest\ntreasures are these letters from my readers and I am always delighted\nto receive them.\n\nL. FRANK BAUM.\n\n\"OZCOT\" at HOLLYWOOD in CALIFORNIA\n\n\n\n\nA MYSTERIOUS ARRIVAL\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\n\"Hello,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Hello,\" answered Trot, looking up surprised. \"Where did you come from?\"\n\n\"Philadelphia,\" said he.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Trot, \"you're a long way from home, then.\"\n\n\"'Bout as far as I can get, in this country,\" the boy replied, gazing\nout over the water. \"Isn't this the Pacific Ocean?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Why of course?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because it's the biggest lot of water in all the world.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Cap'n Bill told me,\" she said.\n\n\"Who's Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"An old sailorman who's a friend of mine. He lives at my house,\ntoo--the white house you see over there on the bluff.\"\n\n\"Oh; is that your home?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Trot proudly. \"Isn't it pretty?\"\n\n\"It's pretty small, seems to me,\" answered the boy.\n\n\"But it's big enough for mother and me, an' for Cap'n Bill,\" said Trot.\n\n\"Haven't you any father?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'ndeed. Cap'n Griffith is my father, but he's gone most of the\ntime, sailin' on his ship. You mus' be a stranger in these parts,\nlittle boy, not to know 'bout Cap'n Griffith,\" she added, looking at\nher new acquaintance intently.\n\nTrot wasn't very big herself, but the boy was not quite as big as Trot.\nHe was thin, with a rather pale complexion, and his blue eyes were\nround and earnest. He wore a blouse waist, a short jacket, and\nknickerbockers. Under his arm he held an old umbrella that was as tall\nas he was. Its covering had once been of thick, brown cloth, but the\ncolor had faded to a dull drab except in the creases, and Trot thought\nit looked very old-fashioned and common. The handle, though, was really\ncurious. It was of wood and carved to resemble an elephant's head. The\nlong trunk of the elephant was curved to make a crook for the handle.\nThe eyes of the beast were small red stones, and it had two tiny tusks\nof ivory.\n\nThe boy's dress was rich and expensive, even to his fine silk stockings\nand tan shoes, but the umbrella looked old and disreputable.\n\n\"It isn't the rainy season now,\" remarked Tot with a smile.\n\nThe boy glanced at his umbrella and hugged it tighter. \"No,\" he said,\n\"but umbrellas are good for other things 'sides rain.\"\n\n\"'Fraid of gett'n sun-struck?\" asked Trot.\n\nHe shook his head, still gazing far out over the water. \"I don't\nb'lieve this is bigger than any other ocean,\" said he. \"I can't see any\nmore of it than I can of the Atlantic.\"\n\n\"You'd find out if you had to sail across it,\" she declared.\n\n\"When I was in Chicago I saw Lake Michigan,\" he went on dreamily, \"and\nit looked just as big as this water does.\"\n\n\"Looks don't count, with oceans,\" she asserted. \"Your eyes can only see\njus' so far, whether you're lookin' at a pond or a great sea.\"\n\n\"Then it doesn't make any difference how big an ocean is,\" he replied.\n\"What are those buildings over there?\" pointing to the right, along the\nshore of the bay.\n\n\"That's the town,\" said Trot. \"Most of the people earn their living by\nfishing. The town is half a mile from here, an' my house is almost a\nhalf-mile the other way, so it's 'bout a mile from my house to the\ntown.\"\n\nThe boy sat down beside her on the flat rock.\n\n\"Do you like girls?\" asked Trot, making room for him.\n\n\"Not very well,\" the boy replied. \"Some of 'em are pretty good fellows,\nbut not many. The girls with brothers are bossy, an' the girls without\nbrothers haven't any 'go' to 'em. But the world's full o' both kinds,\nand so I try to take 'em as they come. They can't help being girls, of\ncourse. Do you like boys?\"\n\n\"When they don't put on airs or get roughhouse,\" replied Trot. \"My\n'sperience with boys is that they don't know much, but think they do.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" he answered. \"I don't like boys much better than I do\ngirls, but some are all right, and--you seem to be one of 'em.\"\n\n\"Much obliged,\" laughed Trot. \"You aren't so bad, either, an' if we\ndon't both turn out worse than we seem, we ought to be friends.\"\n\nHe nodded rather absently and tossed a pebble into the water. \"Been to\ntown?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. Mother wanted some yarn from the store. She's knittin' Cap'n Bill\na stocking.\"\n\n\"Doesn't he wear but one?\"\n\n\"That's all. Cap'n Bill has one wooden leg,\" she explained. \"That's why\nhe don't sailor any more. I'm glad of it, 'cause Cap'n Bill knows\nev'rything. I s'pose he knows more than anyone else in all the world.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" said the boy. \"That's taking a good deal for granted. A\none-legged sailor can't know much.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Trot a little indignantly. \"Folks don't learn things\nwith their legs, do they?\"\n\n\"No, but they can't get around without legs to find out things.\"\n\n\"Cap'n Bill got 'round lively 'nough once, when he had two meat legs,\"\nshe said. \"He's sailed to most ev'ry country on the earth, an' found\nout all that the people in 'em knew and a lot besides. He was\nshipwrecked on a desert island once, and another time a cannibal king\ntried to boil him for dinner, an' one day a shark chased him seven\nleagues through the water, an'--\"\n\n\"What's a league?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"It's a--a distance, like a mile is. But a league isn't a mile, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"You'll have to ask Cap'n Bill. He knows ever'thing.\"\n\n\"Not ever'thing,\" objected the boy. \"I know some things Cap'n Bill\ndon't know.\"\n\n\"If you do, you're pretty smart,\" said Trot.\n\n\"No, I'm not smart. Some folks think I'm stupid. I guess I am. But I\nknow a few things that were wonderful. Cap'n Bill may know more'n I\ndo--a good deal more--but I'm sure he can't know the same things. Say,\nwhat's your name?\"\n\n\"I'm Mayre Griffith, but ever'body calls me 'Trot.' I's a nickname I\ngot when I was a baby, 'cause I trotted so fast when I walked, an' it\nseems to stick. What's YOUR name?\"\n\n\"Button-Bright.\"\n\n\"How did it happen?\"\n\n\"How did what happen?\"\n\n\"Such a funny name.\"\n\nThe boy scowled a little. \"Just like your own nickname happened,\" he\nanswered gloomily. \"My father once said I was bright as a button, an'\nit made ever'body laugh. So they always call me Button-Bright.\"\n\n\"What's your real name?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Saladin Paracelsus de Lambertine Evagne von Smith.\"\n\n\"Guess I'll call you Button-Bright,\" said Trot, sighing. \"The only\nother thing would be 'Salad,' an' I don't like salads. Don't you find\nit hard work to 'member all of your name?\"\n\n\"I don't try to,\" he said. \"There's a lot more of it, but I've\nforgotten the rest.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Trot. \"Oh, here comes Cap'n Bill!\" as she glanced\nover her shoulder.\n\nButton-Bright turned also and looked solemnly at the old sailor who\ncame stumping along the path toward them. Cap'n Bill wasn't a very\nhandsome man. He was old, not very tall, somewhat stout and chubby,\nwith a round face, a bald head, and a scraggly fringe of reddish\nwhisker underneath his chin. But his blue eyes were frank and merry,\nand his smile like a ray of sunshine. He wore a sailor shirt with a\nbroad collar, a short peajacket and wide-bottomed sailor trousers, one\nleg of which covered his wooden limb but did not hide it. As he came\n\"pegging\" along the path--as he himself described his hobbling\nwalk--his hands were pushed into his coat pockets, a pipe was in his\nmouth, and his black neckscarf was fluttering behind him in the breeze\nlike a sable banner.\n\nButton-Bright liked the sailor's looks. There was something very\nwinning--something jolly and carefree and honest and sociable--about\nthe ancient seaman that made him everybody's friend, so the strange boy\nwas glad to meet him.\n\n\"Well, well, Trot,\" he said, coming up, \"is this the way you hurry to\ntown?\"\n\n\"No, for I'm on my way back,\" said she. \"I did hurry when I was going,\nCap'n Bill, but on my way home I sat down here to rest an' watch the\ngulls--the gulls seem awful busy today, Cap'n Bill--an' then I found\nthis boy.\"\n\nCap'n Bill looked at the boy curiously. \"Don't think as ever I sawr him\nat the village,\" he remarked. \"Guess as you're a stranger, my lad.\"\n\nButton-Bright nodded.\n\n\"Hain't walked the nine mile from the railroad station, have ye?\" asked\nCap'n Bill.\n\n\"No,\" said Button-Bright.\n\nThe sailor glanced around him. \"Don't see no waggin er no autymob'l,\"\nhe added.\n\n\"No,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"Catch a ride wi' some one?\"\n\nButton-Bright shook his head.\n\n\"A boat can't land here; the rocks is too thick an' too sharp,\"\ncontinued Cap'n Bill, peering down toward the foot of the bluff on\nwhich they sat and against which the waves broke in foam.\n\n\"No,\" said Button-Bright, \"I didn't come by water.\"\n\nTrot laughed. \"He must 'a' dropped from the sky, Cap'n Bill!\" she\nexclaimed.\n\nButton-Bright nodded very seriously. \"That's it,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, a airship, eh?\" cried Cap'n Bill in surprise. \"I've hearn tell o'\nthem sky keeridges; someth'n' like flyin' autymob'ls, ain't they?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Button-Bright. \"I've never seen one.\"\n\nBoth Trot and Cap'n Bill now looked at the boy in astonishment. \"Now\nthen, lemme think a minute,\" said the sailor reflectively. \"Here's a\nriddle for us to guess, Trot. He dropped from the sky, he says, an' yet\nhe didn't come in a airship!\"\n\n  \"'Riddlecum, riddlecum ree;\n  What can the answer be?'\"\n\nTrot looked the boy over carefully. She didn't see any wings on him.\nThe only queer thing about him was his big umbrella. \"Oh!\" she said\nsuddenly, clapping her hands together. \"I know now.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" asked Cap'n Bill doubtfully. \"Then you're some smarter ner I\nam, mate.\"\n\n\"He sailed down with the umbrel!\" she cried. \"He used his umbrel as a\npara--para--\"\n\n\"Shoot,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"They're called parashoots, mate; but why, I\ncan't say. Did you drop down in that way, my lad?\" he asked the boy.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Button-Bright. \"That was the way.\"\n\n\"But how did you get up there?\" asked Trot. \"You had to get up in the\nair before you could drop down, an'--oh, Cap'n Bill! He says he's from\nPhillydelfy, which is a big city way at the other end of America.\"\n\n\"Are you?\" asked the sailor, surprised.\n\nButton-Bright nodded again. \"I ought to tell you my story,\" he said,\n\"and then you'd understand. But I'm afraid you won't believe me, and--\"\nhe suddenly broke off and looked toward the white house in the distance\n\"--Didn't you say you lived over there?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Trot. \"Won't you come home with us?\"\n\n\"I'd like to,\" replied Button-Bright.\n\n\"All right, let's go then,\" said the girl, jumping up.\n\nThe three walked silently along the path. The old sailorman had\nrefilled his pipe and lighted it again, and he smoked thoughtfully as\nhe pegged along beside the children. \"Know anyone around here?\" he\nasked Button-Bright.\n\n\"No one but you two,\" said the boy, following after Trot, with his\numbrella tucked carefully underneath his arm.\n\n\"And you don't know us very well,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"Seems to me\nyou're pretty young to be travelin' so far from home an' among\nstrangers. But I won't say anything more till we've heard your story.\nThen, if you need my advice, or Trot's advice--she's a wise little\ngirl, fer her size, Trot is--we'll freely give it an' be glad to help\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied Button-Bright. \"I need a lot of things, I'm sure,\nand p'raps advice is one of 'em.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAGIC UMBRELLA\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nWhen they reached the neat frame cottage which stood on a high bluff a\nlittle back from the sea and was covered with pretty green vines, a\nwoman came to the door to meet them. She seemed motherly and good, and\nwhen she saw Button-Bright, she exclaimed, \"Goodness me! Who's this\nyou've got, Trot?\"\n\n\"It's a boy I've just found,\" explained the girl. \"He lives way off in\nPhillydelphy.\"\n\n\"Mercy sakes alive!\" cried Mrs. Griffith, looking into his upturned\nface. \"I don't believe he's had a bite to eat since he started. Ain't\nyou hungry, child?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"Run, Trot, an' get two slices o' bread-an'-butter,\" commanded Mrs.\nGriffith. \"Cut 'em thick, dear, an' use plenty of butter.\"\n\n\"Sugar on 'em?\" asked Trot, turning to obey.\n\n\"No,\" said Button-Bright. \"Just bread-an'-butter's good enough when\nyou're hungry, and it takes time to spread sugar on.\"\n\n\"We'll have supper in an hour,\" observed Trot's mother briskly, \"but a\nhungry child can't wait a whole hour, I'm sure. What are you grinning\nat, Cap'n Bill? How dare you laugh when I'm talking? Stop it this\nminute, you old pirate, or I'll know the reason why!\"\n\n\"I didn't, mum,\" said Cap'n Bill meekly. \"I on'y--\"\n\n\"Stop right there, sir! How dare you speak when I'm talking?\" She\nturned to Button-Bright, and her tone changed to one of much gentleness\nas she said, \"Come in the house, my poor boy, an' rest yourself. You\nseem tired out. Here, give me that clumsy umbrella.\"\n\n\"No, please,\" said Button-Bright, holding the umbrella tighter.\n\n\"Then put it in the rack behind the door,\" she urged.\n\nThe boy seemed a little frightened. \"I--I'd rather keep it with me, if\nyou please,\" he pleaded.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Cap'n Bill ventured to say, \"it won't worry him so much\nto hold the umbrella, mum, as to let it go. Guess he's afraid he'll\nlose it, but it ain't any great shakes, to my notion. Why, see here,\nButton-Bright, we've got half-a-dozen umbrellas in the closet that's\nbetter ner yours.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the boy. \"Yours may look a heap better, sir, but--I'll\nkeep this one, if you please.\"\n\n\"Where did you get it?\" asked Trot, appearing just then with a plate of\nbread-and-butter.\n\n\"It--it belongs in our family,\" said Button-Bright, beginning to eat\nand speaking between bites. \"This umbrella has been in our family\nyears, an' years, an' years. But it was tucked away up in our attic an'\nno one ever used it 'cause it wasn't pretty.\"\n\n\"Don't blame 'em much,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, gazing at it curiously.\n\"It's a pretty old-lookin' bumbershoot.\" They were all seated in the\nvine-shaded porch of the cottage--all but Mrs. Griffith, who had gone\ninto the kitchen to look after the supper--and Trot was on one side of\nthe boy, holding the plate for him, while Cap'n Bill sat on the other\nside.\n\n\"It is old,\" said Button-Bright. \"One of my great-great-grandfathers\nwas a Knight--an Arabian Knight--and it was he who first found this\numbrella.\"\n\n\"An Arabian Night!\" exclaimed Trot. \"Why, that was a magic night,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"There's diff'rent sorts o' nights, mate,\" said the sailor, \"an' the\nknight Button-Bright means ain't the same night you mean. Soldiers used\nto be called knights, but that were in the dark ages, I guess, an'\nlikely 'nough Butt'n-Bright's great-gran'ther were that sort of a\nknight.\"\n\n\"But he said an Arabian Knight,\" persisted Trot.\n\n\"Well, if he went to Araby, or was born there, he'd be an Arabian\nKnight, wouldn't he? The lad's gran'ther were prob'ly a furriner, an'\nyours an' mine were, too, Trot, if you go back far enough; for Ameriky\nwasn't diskivered in them days.\"\n\n\"There!\" said Trot triumphantly. \"Didn't I tell you, Button-Bright,\nthat Cap'n Bill knows ever'thing?\"\n\n\"He knows a lot, I expect,\" soberly answered the boy, finishing the\nlast slice of bread-and-butter and then looking at the empty plate with\na sigh. \"But if he really knows ever'thing, he knows about the Magic\nUmbrella, so I won't have to tell you anything about it.\"\n\n\"Magic!\" cried Trot with big, eager eyes. \"Did you say MAGIC Umbrel,\nButton-Bright?\"\n\n\"I said 'Magic.' But none of our family knew it was a Magic Umbrella\ntill I found it out for myself. You're the first people I've told the\nsecret to,\" he added, glancing into their faces rather uneasily.\n\n\"Glory me!\" exclaimed the girl, clapping her hands in ecstacy. \"It must\nbe jus' ELEGANT to have a Magic Umbrel!\"\n\nCap'n Bill coughed. He had a way of coughing when he was suspicious.\n\"Magic,\" he observed gravely, \"was once lyin' 'round loose in the\nworld. That was in the Dark Ages, I guess, when the magic Arabian\nNights was. But the light o' Civilization has skeered it away long ago,\nan' magic's been a lost art since long afore you an' I was born, Trot.\"\n\n\"I know that fairies still live,\" said Trot reflectively. She didn't\nlike to contradict Cap'n Bill, who knew \"ever'thing.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" added Button-Bright. \"And I know there's magic still in the\nworld--or in my umbrella, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Tell us about it!\" begged the girl excitedly.\n\n\"Well,\" said the boy, \"I found it all out by accident. It rained in\nPhiladelphia for three whole days, and all the umbrellas in our house\nwere carried out by the family and lost or mislaid or something, so\nthat when I wanted to go to Uncle Bob's house, which is at Germantown,\nthere wasn't an umbrella to be found. My governess wouldn't let me go\nwithout one, and--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Trot. \"Do you have a governess?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I don't like her. She's cross. She said I couldn't go to\nUncle Bob's because I had no umbrella. Instead she told me to go up in\nthe attic and play. I was sorry 'bout that, but I went up in the attic,\nand pretty soon I found in a corner this old umbrella. I didn't care\nhow it looked. It was whole and strong and big, and would keep me from\ngetting wet on the way to Uncle Bob's. So off I started for the car,\nbut I found the streets awful muddy, and once I stepped in a mud-hole\nway up to my ankle. 'Gee!,' I said, 'I wish I could fly through the air\nto Uncle Bob's.'\n\n\"I was holding up the open umbrella when I said that, and as soon as I\nspoke, the umbrella began lifting me up into the air. I was awful\nscared at first, but I held on tight to the handle, and it didn't pull\nvery much, either. I was going pretty fast, for when I looked down all\nthe big buildings were sliding past me so swift that it made me dizzy,\nand before I really knew what had happened the umbrella settled down\nand stood me on my feet at Uncle Bob's front gate.\n\n\"I didn't tell anybody about the wonderful thing that had happened,\n'cause I thought no one would believe me. Uncle Bob looked sharp at the\nthing an' said, 'Button-Bright, how did your father happen to let you\ntake that umbrella?' 'He didn't,' I said. 'Father was away at the\noffice, so I found it in the attic an' I jus' took it.' Then Uncle Bob\nshook his head an' said I ought to leave it alone. He said it was a\nfam'ly relic that had been handed down from father to son for many\ngenerations. But I told him my father had never handed it to me, though\nI'm his son. Uncle Bob said our fam'ly always believed that it brought\n'em good luck to own this umbrella. He couldn't say why, not knowing\nits early history, but he was afraid that if I lost the umbrella, bad\nluck would happen to us. So he made me go right home to put the\numbrella back where I got it. I was sorry Uncle Bob was so cross, and I\ndidn't want to go home yet, where the governess was crosser 'n he was.\nI wonder why folks get cross when it rains? But by that time it had\nstopped raining--for awhile, anyhow--and Uncle Bob told me to go\nstraight home and put the umbrella in the attic an' never touch it\nagain.\n\n\"When I was around the corner, I thought I'd see if I could fly as I\nhad before. I'd heard of Buffalo, but I didn't know just where it was,\nso I said to the umbrella, 'Take me to Buffalo.' Up in the air I went,\njust as soon as I said it, and the umbrella sailed so fast that I felt\nas if I was in a gale of wind. It was a long, long trip, and I got\nawful tired holding onto the handle, but just as I thought I'd have to\nlet go, I began to drop down slowly, and then I found myself in the\nstreets of a big city. I put down the umbrella and asked a man what the\nname of the city was, and he said 'Buffalo'.\"\n\n\"How wonderful!\" gasped Trot. Cap'n Bill kept on smoking and said\nnothing.\n\n\"It was magic, I'm sure,\" said Button-Bright. \"It surely couldn't have\nbeen anything else.\"\n\n\"P'raps,\" suggested Trot, \"the umbrella can do other magic things.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the boy. \"I've tried it. When I landed in Buffalo I was hot\nand thirsty. I had ten cents car fare, but I was afraid to spend it. So\nI held up the umbrella and wished I had an ice-cream soda, but I didn't\nget it. Then I wished for a nickel to buy an ice-cream soda with, but I\ndidn't get that, either. I got frightened and was afraid the umbrella\ndidn't have any magic left, so to try it I said 'Take me to Chicago.' I\ndidn't want to go to Chicago, but that was the first place I thought\nof, and I soon saw this was going to be another long journey, so I\ncalled out to the umbrella, 'Never mind. Stop! I guess I won't go to\nChicago. I've changed my mind, so take me home again.' But the umbrella\nwouldn't. It kept right on flying, and I shut my eyes and held on. At\nlast I landed in Chicago, and then I was in a pretty fix. It was nearly\ndark, and I was too tired and hungry to make the trip home again. I\nknew I'd get an awful scolding, too, for running away and taking the\nfamily luck with me, so I thought that as long as I was in for it, I'd\nbetter see a good deal of the country while I had the chance. I\nwouldn't be allowed to come away again, you know.\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" said Trot.\n\n\"I bought some buns and milk with my ten cents, and then I walked\naround the streets of Chicago for a time and afterward slept on a bench\nin one of the parks. In the morning I tried to get the umbrella to give\nme a magic breakfast, but it won't do anything but fly. I went to a\nhouse and asked a woman for something to eat, and she gave me all I\nwanted and advised me to go straight home before my mother worried\nabout me. She didn't know I lived in Philadelphia. That was this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"This mornin'!\" exclaimed Cap'n Bill. \"Why, lad, it takes three or four\ndays for the railroad trains to get to this coast from Chicago.\"\n\n\"I know,\" replied Button-Bright. \"But I didn't come on a railroad\ntrain. This umbrella goes faster than any train ever did. This morning\nI flew from Chicago to Denver, but no one there would give me any\nlunch. A policeman said he'd put me in jail if he caught me begging, so\nI got away and told the umbrella to take me to the Pacific Ocean. When\nI stopped I landed over there by the big rock. I shut up the umbrella\nand saw a girl sitting on the rock, so I went up and spoke to her.\nThat's all.\"\n\n\"Goodness me!\" said Trot. \"If that isn't a fairy story, I never heard\none.\"\n\n\"It IS a fairy story,\" agreed Button-Bright. \"Anyhow, it's a magic\nstory, and the funny part of it is, it's true. I hope you believe me,\nbut I don't know as I'd believe it myself if it hadn't been me that it\nhappened to.\"\n\n\"I believe ev'ry word of it!\" declared Trot earnestly.\n\n\"As fer me,\" said Cap'n Bill slowly, \"I'm goin' to believe it, too,\nby'm'by, when I've seen the umbrel fly once.\"\n\n\"You'll see me fly away with it,\" asserted the boy. \"But at present\nit's pretty late in the day, and Philadelphia is a good way off. Do you\ns'pose, Trot, your mother would let me stay here all night?\"\n\n\"Course she would!\" answered Trot. \"We've got an extra room with a nice\nbed in it, and we'd love to have you stay just as long as you want to,\nwouldn't we, Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"Right you are, mate,\" replied the old man, nodding his bald head.\n\"Whether the umbrel is magic or not, Butt'n-Bright is welcome.\"\n\nMrs. Griffith came out soon after and seconded the invitation, so the\nboy felt quite at home in the little cottage. It was not long before\nsupper was on the table and in spite of all the bread-and-butter he had\neaten Button-Bright had a fine appetite for the good things Trot's\nmother had cooked. Mrs. Griffith was very kind to the children, but not\nquite so agreeable toward poor Cap'n Bill. When the old sailorman at\none time spilled some tea on the tablecloth, Trot's mother flew angry\nand gave the culprit such a tongue-lashing that Button-Bright was sorry\nfor him. But Cap'n Bill was meek and made no reply. \"He's used to it,\nyou know,\" whispered Trot to her new friend, and indeed, Cap'n Bill\ntook it all cheerfully and never minded a bit.\n\nThen it came Trot's turn to get a scolding. When she opened the parcel\nshe had bought at the village, it was found she had selected the wrong\ncolor of yarn, and Mrs. Griffith was so provoked that Trot's scolding\nwas almost as severe as that of Cap'n Bill. Tears came to the little\ngirl's eyes, and to comfort her the boy promised to take her to the\nvillage next morning with his magic umbrella, so she could exchange the\nyarn for the right color.\n\nTrot quickly brightened at this promise, although Cap'n Bill looked\ngrave and shook his head solemnly. When supper was over and Trot had\nhelped with the dishes, she joined Button-Bright and the sailorman on\nthe little porch again. Dusk had fallen, and the moon was just rising.\nThey all sat in silence for a time and watched the silver trail that\ntopped the crests of the waves far out to sea.\n\n\"Oh, Button-Bright!\" cried the little girl presently. \"I'm so glad\nyou're going to let me fly with you way to town and back tomorrow.\nWon't it be fine, Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"Dunno, Trot,\" said he. \"I can't figger how both of you can hold on to\nthe handle o' that umbrel.\"\n\nTrot's face fell. \"I'll hold on to the handle,\" said Button-Bright,\n\"and she can hold on to me. It doesn't pull hard at all. You've no idea\nhow easy it is to fly that way after you get used to it.\"\n\n\"But Trot ain't used to it,\" objected the sailor. \"If she happened to\nlose her hold and let go, it's goodbye Trot. I don't like to risk it,\nfor Trot's my chum, an' I can't afford to lose her.\"\n\n\"Can't you tie us together, then?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"We'll see, we'll see,\" replied Cap'n Bill, and began to think very\ndeeply. He forgot that he didn't believe the umbrella could fly, and\nafter Button-Bright and Trot had both gone to bed, the old sailor went\nout into the shed and worked a while before he, too, turned into his\n\"bunk.\" The sandman wasn't around, and Cap'n Bill lay awake for hours\nthinking of the strange tale of the Magic Umbrella before he finally\nsank into slumber. Then he dreamed about it, and waking or dreaming he\nfound the tale hard to believe.\n\n\n\n\nA WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nThey had early breakfasts at Trot's house, because they all went to bed\nearly, and it is possible to sleep only a certain number of hours if\none is healthy in body and mind. And right after breakfast Trot claimed\nButton-Bright's promise to take her to town with the Magic Umbrella.\n\n\"Any time suits me,\" said the boy. He had taken his precious umbrella\nto bed with him and even carried it to the breakfast table, where he\nstood it between his knees as he ate; so now he held it close to him\nand said he was ready to fly at a moment's notice. This confidence\nimpressed Cap'n Bill, who said with a sigh:\n\n\"Well, if you MUST go, Trot, I've pervided a machine that'll carry you\nboth comf'table. I'm summat of an inventor myself, though there ain't\nany magic about me.\"\n\nThen he brought from the shed the contrivance he had made the night\nbefore. It was merely a swing seat. He had taken a wide board that was\njust long enough for both the boy and girl to sit upon, and had bored\nsix holes in it, two holes at each end and two in the middle. Through\nthese holes he had run stout ropes in such a way that the seat could\nnot turn and the occupants could hold on to the ropes on either side of\nthem. The ropes were all knotted together at the top, where there was a\nloop that could be hooked upon the crooked handle of the umbrella.\n\nButton-Bright and Trot both thought Cap'n Bill's invention very clever.\nThe sailor placed the board upon the ground while they sat in their\nplaces, Button-Bright at the right of Trot, and then the boy hooked the\nrope loop to the handle of the umbrella, which he spread wide open. \"I\nwant to go to the town over yonder,\" he said, pointing with his finger\nto the roofs of the houses that showed around the bend in the cliff.\n\nAt once the umbrella rose into the air, slowly at first, but quickly\ngathering speed. Trot and Button-Bright held fast to the ropes and were\ncarried along very easily and comfortably. It seemed scarcely a minute\nbefore they were in the town, and when the umbrella set them down just\nin front of the store--for it seemed to know just where they wanted to\ngo--a wondering crowd gathered around them. Trot ran in and changed the\nyarn, while Button-Bright stayed outside and stared at the people who\nstared at him. They asked questions, too, wanting to know what sort of\nan aeroplane this was and where his power was stored and lots of other\nthings, but the boy answered not a sound. When the little girl came\nback and took her seat, Button-Bright said, \"I want to go to Trot's\nhouse.\"\n\nThe simple villagers could not understand how the umbrella suddenly\nlifted the two children into the air and carried them away. They had\nread of airships, but here was something wholly beyond their\ncomprehension.\n\nCap'n Bill had stood in front of the house, watching with a feeling\nakin to bewilderment the flight of the Magic Umbrella. He could follow\nits course until it descended in the village, and he was so amazed and\nabsorbed that his pipe went out. He had not moved from his position\nwhen the umbrella started back. The sailor's big blue eyes watched it\ndraw near and settle down with its passengers upon just the spot it had\nstarted from.\n\nTrot was joyous and greatly excited. \"Oh, Cap'n, it's gal-lor-ious!\"\nshe cried in ecstasy. \"It beats ridin' in a boat or--or--in anything\nelse. You feel so light an' free an'--an'--glad! I'm sorry the trip\ndidn't last longer, though. Only trouble is, you go too fast.\"\n\nButton-Bright was smiling contentedly. He had proved to both Trot and\nCap'n Bill that he had told the truth about the Magic Umbrella, however\nmarvelous his tale had seemed to them. \"I'll take you on another trip,\nif you like,\" said he. \"I'm in no hurry to go home, and if you will let\nme stay with you another day, we can make two or three little trips\nwith the family luck.\"\n\n\"You mus' stay a whole week,\" said Trot decidedly. \"An' you mus' take\nCap'n Bill for an air-ride, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, Trot! I dunno as I'd like it,\" protested Cap'n Bill nervously.\n\n\"Yes you would. You're sure to like it.\"\n\n\"I guess I'm too heavy.\"\n\n\"I'm sure the umbrella could carry twenty people if they could be\nfastened to the handle,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"Solid land's pretty good to hold on to,\" decided Cap'n Bill. \"A rope\nmight break, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cap'n Bill! You're scared stiff,\" said Trot.\n\n\"I ain't, mate. It ain't that at all. But I don't see that human\ncritters has any call to fly in the air, anyhow. The air were made for\nthe birds, an'--an' muskeeters, an'--\"\n\n\"An' flyin'-fishes,\" added Trot. \"I know all that, Cap'n, but why\nwasn't it made for humans, too, if they can manage to fly in it? We\nbreathe the air, an' we can breathe it high up, just as well as down on\nthe earth.\"\n\n\"Seein' as you like it so much, Trot, it would be cruel for me to go\nwith Butt'n-Bright an' leave you at home,\" said the sailor. \"When I\nwere younger--which is ancient history--an' afore I had a wooden leg, I\ncould climb a ship's ropes with the best of 'em, an' walk out on a boom\nor stand atop a mast. So you know very well I ain't skeered about the\nhighupness.\"\n\n\"Why can't we all go together?\" asked the boy. \"Make another seat,\nCap'n, and swing it right under ours. Then we can all three ride\nanywhere we want to go.\"\n\n\"Yes, do!\" exclaimed Trot. \"And see here, Cap'n, let's take a day off\nand have a picnic. Mother is a little cross today, and she wants to\nfinish knitting your new stockin', so I guess she'll be glad to get rid\nof us.\"\n\n\"Where'll we go?\" he asked, shifting on his wooden leg uneasily.\n\n\"Anywhere. I don't care. There'll be the air-ride there an' the\nair-ride back, an' that's the main thing with ME. If you say we'll go,\nCap'n, I'll run in an' pack a basket of lunch.\"\n\n\"How'll we carry it?\"\n\n\"Swing it to the bottom of your seat.\"\n\nThe old sailor stood silent a moment. He really longed to take the\nair-ride but was fearful of danger. However, Trot had gone safely to\ntown and back and had greatly enjoyed the experience. \"All right,\" he\nsaid. \"I'll risk it, mate, although I guess I'm an old fool for\ntemptin' fate by tryin' to make a bird o' myself. Get the lunch, Trot,\nif your mother'll let you have it, and I'll rig up the seat.\"\n\nHe went into the shed and Trot went to her mother. Mrs. Griffith, busy\nwith her work, knew nothing of what was going on in regard to the\nflight of the Magic Umbrella. She never objected when Trot wanted to go\naway with Cap'n Bill for a day's picnicking. She knew the child was\nperfectly safe with the old sailor, who cared for Trot even better than\nher mother would have done. If she had asked any questions today and\nhad found out they intended to fly in the air, she might have seriously\nobjected, but Mrs. Griffith had her mind on other things and merely\ntold the girl to take what she wanted from the cupboard and not bother\nher. So Trot, remembering that Button-Bright would be with them and had\nproved himself to be a hearty eater, loaded the basket with all the\ngood things she could find.\n\nBy the time she came out, lugging the basket with both hands, Cap'n\nBill appeared with the new seat he had made for his own use, which he\nattached by means of ropes to the double seat of the boy and girl. \"Now\nthen, where'll we go?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Anywhere suits me,\" replied Cap'n Bill. They had walked to the high\nbluff overlooking the sea, where a gigantic acacia tree stood on the\nvery edge. A seat had been built around the trunk of the tree, for this\nwas a favorite spot for Trot and Cap'n Bill to sit and talk and watch\nthe fleet of fishing boats sail to and from the village. When they came\nto this tree, Trot was still trying to think of the most pleasant place\nto picnic. She and Cap'n Bill had been every place that was desirable\nand nearby, but today they didn't want a nearby spot. They must decide\nupon one far enough away to afford them a fine trip through the air.\nLooking far out over the Pacific, the girl's eyes fell upon a dim\nisland lying on the horizon line just where the sky and water seemed to\nmeet, and the sight gave her an idea.\n\n\"Oh, Cap'n Bill!\" she exclaimed. \"Let's go to that island for our\npicnic. We've never been there yet, you know.\"\n\nThe sailor shook his head. \"It's a good many miles away, Trot,\" he\nsaid, \"further than it looks to be from here.\"\n\n\"That won't matter,\" remarked Button-Bright. \"The umbrella will carry\nus there in no time.\"\n\n\"Let's go!\" repeated Trot. \"We'll never have another such chance,\nCap'n. It's too far to sail or row, and I've always wanted to visit\nthat island.\"\n\n\"What's the name of it?\" inquired Button-Bright while the sailor\nhesitated to decide.\n\n\"Oh, it's got an awful hard name to pernounce,\" replied the girl, \"so\nCap'n Bill and I jus' call it 'Sky Island' 'cause it looks as if it was\nhalf in the sky. We've been told it's a very pretty island, and a few\npeople live there and keep cows and goats and fish for a living. There\nare woods and pastures and springs of clear water, and I'm sure we\nwould find it a fine place for a picnic.\"\n\n\"If anything happened on the way,\" observed Cap'n Bill, \"we'd drop in\nthe water.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Trot, \"and if anything happened while we were flyin'\nover the land, we'd drop there. But nothing's goin' to happen, Cap'n.\nDidn't Button-Bright come safe all the way from Philydelfy?\"\n\n\"I think I'd like to go to Sky Island,\" said the boy. \"I've always\nflown above the land so far, and it will be something new to fly over\nthe ocean.\"\n\n\"All right, I'm agree'ble,\" decided Cap'n Bill. \"But afore we starts on\nsuch a long journey, s'pose we make a little trial trip along the\ncoast. I want to see if the new seat fits me an' make certain the\numbrel will carry all three of us.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Button-Bright. \"Where shall we go?\"\n\n\"Let's go as far as Smuggler's Cove an' then turn 'round an' come back.\nIf all's right an' shipshape, then we can start for the island.\"\n\nThey put the broad double seat on the ground, and then the boy and girl\nsat in their places and Button-Bright spread open the Magic Umbrella.\nCap'n Bill sat in his seat just in front of them, all being upon the\nground.\n\n\"Don't we look funny?\" said Trot with a chuckle of glee. \"But hold fast\nthe ropes, Cap'n, an' take care of your wooden leg.\"\n\nButton-Bright addressed the umbrella, speaking to it very respectfully,\nfor it was a thing to inspire awe. \"I want to go as far as Smuggler's\nCove and then turn around in the air and come back here,\" he said. At\nonce the umbrella rose into the air, lifting after it first the seat in\nwhich the children sat, and then Cap'n Bill's seat.\n\n\"Don't kick your heels, Trot!\" cried the sailor in a voice that proved\nhe was excited by his novel experience. \"You might bump me in the nose.\"\n\n\"All right,\" she called back. \"I'll be careful.\"\n\nIt was really a wonderful, exhilarating ride, and Cap'n Bill wasn't\nlong making up his mind he liked the sensation. When about fifty feet\nabove the ground the umbrella began moving along the coast toward\nSmuggler's Cove, which it soon reached. Looking downward, Cap'n Bill\nsuddenly exclaimed, \"Why, there' a boat cast loose, an' it's goin' to\nsmash on the rocks. Hold on a minute, Butt'n-Bright, till we can land\nan' drag it ashore.\"\n\n\"Hold on a minute, Umbrella!\" cried the boy. But the Magic Umbrella\nkept steadily upon its way. It made a circle over the Cove and then\nstarted straight back the way it had come. \"It's no use, sir,\" said\nButton-Bright to the sailor. \"If I once tell it to go to a certain\nplace, the umbrella will go there, and nowhere else. I've found that\nout before this. You simply CAN'T stop it.\"\n\n\"Won't let you change your mind, eh?\" replied Cap'n Bill. \"Well, that\nhas its advantidges, an' its disadvantiges. If your ol' umbrel hadn't\nbeen so obstinate, we could have saved that boat.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Trot briskly, \"here we are safe back again. Wasn't\nit jus' the--the fascinatingest ride you ever took, Cap'n?\"\n\n\"It's pretty good fun,\" admitted Cap'n Bill. \"Beats them aeroplanes an'\nthings all holler, 'cause it don't need any regulatin.'\"\n\n\"If we're going to that island, we may as well start right away,\" said\nButton-Bright when they had safely landed.\n\n\"All right. I'll tie on the lunch-basket,\" answered the sailor. He\nfastened it so it would swing underneath his own seat, and they all\ntook their places again.\n\n\"Ready?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Let 'er go, my lad.\"\n\n\"I want to go to Sky Island,\" said Button-Bright to the umbrella, using\nthe name Trot had given him. The umbrella started promptly. It rose\nhigher than before, carrying the three voyagers with it, and then\nstarted straight away over the ocean.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ISLAND IN THE SKY\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nThey clung tightly to the ropes, but the breeze was with them, so after\na few moments, when they became accustomed to the motion, they began to\nenjoy the ride immensely.\n\nLarger and larger grew the island, and although they were headed\ndirectly toward it, the umbrella seemed to rise higher and higher into\nthe air the farther it traveled. They had not journeyed ten minutes\nbefore they came directly over the island, and looking down they could\nsee the forests and meadows far below them. But the umbrella kept up\nits rapid flight.\n\n\"Hold on, there!\" cried Cap'n Bill. \"If it ain't keerful, the ol' thing\nwill pass by the island.\"\n\n\"I--I'm sure it has passed it already,\" exclaimed Trot. \"What's wrong,\nButton-Bright? Why don't we stop?\"\n\nButton-Bright seemed astonished, too.\n\n\"Perhaps I didn't say it right,\" he replied after a moment's thought.\nThen, looking up at the umbrella, he repeated distinctly, \"I said I\nwanted to go to Sky Island! Sky Island, don't you understand?\"\n\nThe umbrella swept steadily along, getting farther and farther out to\nsea and rising higher and higher toward the clouds.\n\n\"Mack'rel an' herrings!\" roared Cap'n Bill, now really frightened.\n\"Ain't there any blamed way at all to stop her?\"\n\n\"None that I know of,\" said Button-Bright anxiously.\n\n\"P'raps,\" said Trot after a pause during which she tried hard to think.\n\"P'raps 'Sky Island' isn't the name of that island at all.\"\n\n\"Why, we know very well it ain't the name of it,\" yelled Cap'n Bill\nfrom below. \"We jus' called it that 'cause its right name is too hard\nto say.\"\n\n\"That's the whole trouble, then,\" returned Button-Bright. \"Somewhere in\nthe world there's a real Sky Island, and having told the Magic Umbrella\nto take us there, it's going to do so.\"\n\n\"Well, I declare!\" gasped the sailorman. \"Can't we land anywhere else?\"\n\n\"Not unless you care to tumble off,\" said the boy. \"I've told the\numbrella to take us to Sky Island, so that's the exact place we're\nbound for. I'm sorry. It was your fault for giving me the wrong name.\"\n\nThey glided along in silence for a while. The island was now far behind\nthem, growing small in the distance. \"Where do you s'pose the real Sky\nIsland can be?\" asked Trot presently.\n\n\"We can't tell anything about it until we get there,\" Button-Bright\nanswered. \"Seems to me I've heard of the Isle of Skye, but that's over\nin Great Britain, somewhere the other side of the world, and it isn't\nSky Island, anyhow.\"\n\n\"This miser'ble ol' umbrel is too pertic'ler,\" growled Cap'n Bill. \"It\nwon't let you change your mind an' it goes ezzac'ly where you say.\"\n\n\"If it didn't,\" said Trot, \"we'd never know where we were going.\"\n\n\"We don't know now,\" said the sailor. \"One thing's certain, folks:\nwe're gett'n' a long way from home.\"\n\n\"And see how the clouds are rolling just above us,\" remarked the boy,\nwho was almost as uneasy as Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"We're in the sky, all right,\" said the girl. \"If there could be an\nisland up here among the clouds, I'd think it was there we're going.\"\n\n\"Couldn't there be one?\" asked Button-Bright. \"Why couldn't there be an\nisland in the sky that would be named Sky Island?\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" declared Cap'n Bill. \"There wouldn't be anything to\nhold it up, you know.\"\n\n\"What's holding US up?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Magic, I guess.\"\n\n\"Then magic might hold an island in the sky. Whee-e-e! What a black\ncloud!\"\n\nIt grew suddenly dark, for they were rushing through a thick cloud that\nrolled around them in billows. Trot felt little drops of moisture\nstriking her face and knew her clothing was getting damp and soggy.\n\"It's a rain cloud,\" she said to Button-Bright, \"and it seems like an\nawful big one, 'cause it takes so long for us to pass through it.\"\n\nThe umbrella never hesitated a moment. It made a path through the\nlength of the heavy, black cloud at last and carried its passengers\ninto a misty, billowy bank of white, which seemed as soft and fleecy as\na lady's veil. When this broke away, they caught sight of a majestic\nrainbow spanning the heavens, its gorgeous colors glinting brightly in\nthe sun, its arch perfect and unbroken from end to end. But it was only\na glimpse they had, for quickly they dove into another bank of clouds\nand the rainbow disappeared.\n\nHere the clouds were not black, nor heavy, but they assumed queer\nshapes. Some were like huge ships, some like forest trees, and others\npiled themselves into semblances of turreted castles and wonderful\npalaces. The shapes shifted here and there continually, and the\nvoyagers began to be bewildered by the phantoms.\n\n\"Seems to me we're goin' down,\" called Trot.\n\n\"Down where?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Who knows?\" said Button-Bright. \"But we're dropping, all right.\"\n\nIt was a gradual descent. The Magic Umbrella maintained a uniform\nspeed, swift and unfaltering, but its path through the heavens was now\nin the shape of an arch, as a flying arrow falls. The queer shapes of\nthe clouds continued for some time, and once or twice Trot was a little\nfrightened when a monstrous airy dragon passed beside them or a huge\ngiant stood upon a peak of cloud and stared savagely at the intruders\ninto his domain. But none of these fanciful, vapory creatures seemed\ninclined to molest them or to interfere with their flight, and after a\nwhile the umbrella dipped below this queer cloudland and entered a\nclear space where the sky was of an exquisite blue color.\n\n\"Oh, look!\" called Cap'n Bill. \"There's land below us.\" The boy and\ngirl leaned over and tried to see this land, but Cap'n Bill was also\nleaning over, and his big body hid all that was just underneath them.\n\n\"Is it an island?\" asked Trot solemnly.\n\n\"Seems so,\" the old sailor replied. \"The blue is around all one side of\nit an' a pink sunshine around the other side. There's a big cloud just\nover the middle, but I guess it's surely an island, Trot, an' bein' as\nit's in the sky, it's likely to be Sky Island.\"\n\n\"Then we shall land there,\" said the boy confidently. \"I knew the\numbrella wouldn't make a mistake.\"\n\nPresently Cap'n Bill spoke again. \"We're goin' down on the blue part o'\nthe island,\" he said. \"I can see trees an' ponds an' houses. Hold\ntight, Trot! Hold tight, Butt'n-Bright! I'm afeared we're a'goin' to\nbump somethin'!\"\n\nThey were certainly dropping very quickly now, and the rush of air made\ntheir eyes fill with water so that they could not see much below them.\nSuddenly, the basket that was dangling below Cap'n Bill struck\nsomething with a loud thud, and this was followed by a yell of anger.\nCap'n Bill sat flat upon the ground, landing with such a force that\njarred the sailorman and made his teeth click together, while down upon\nhim came the seat that Trot and Button-Bright occupied, so that for a\nmoment they were all tangled up.\n\n\"Get off from me! Get off from my feet, I say!\" cried an excited voice.\n\"What in the Sky do you mean by sitting on my feet? Get off! Get off at\nonce!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nCap'n Bill suspected that these remarks were addressed to him, but he\ncouldn't move just then because the seat was across him, and a boy and\ngirl were sprawling on the seat. As the Magic Umbrella was now as\nmotionless as any ordinary umbrella might be, Button-Bright first\nreleased the catch and closed it up, after which he unhooked the\ncrooked handle from the rope and rose to his feet. Trot had managed by\nthis time to stand up, and she pulled the board off from Cap'n Bill.\nAll this time the shrill, excited voice was loudly complaining because\nthe sailor was on his feet, and Trot looked to see who was making the\nprotest, while Cap'n Bill rolled over and got on his hands and knees so\nhe could pull his meat leg and his wooden leg into an upright position,\nwhich wasn't a very easy thing to do.\n\nButton-Bright and Trot were staring with all their might at the\nqueerest person they had ever seen. They decided it must be a man\nbecause he had two long legs, a body as round as a ball, a neck like an\nostrich, and a comical little head set on the top of it. But the most\ncurious thing about him was his skin, which was of a lovely sky-blue\ntint. His eyes were also sky-blue, and his hair, which was trained\nstraight up and ended in a curl at the top of his head, was likewise\nblue in color and matched his skin and his eyes. He wore tight-fitting\nclothes made of sky-blue silk, with a broad blue ruffle around his long\nneck, and on his breast glittered a magnificent jewel in the form of a\nstar, set with splendid blue stones.\n\nIf the blue man astonished the travelers, they were no less surprised\nby his surroundings, for look where they might, everything they beheld\nwas of the same blue color as the sky above. They seemed to have landed\nin a large garden, surrounded by a high wall of blue stone. The trees\nwere all blue, the grass was blue, the flowers were blue, and even the\npebbles in the paths were blue. There were many handsomely carved\nbenches and seats of blue wood scattered about the garden, and near\nthem stood a fountain made of blue marble, which shot lovely sprays of\nblue water into the blue air.\n\nBut the angry inhabitants of this blue place would not permit them to\nlook around them in peace, for as soon as Cap'n Bill rolled off his\ntoes, he began dancing around in an excited way and saying very\ndisrespectful things of his visitors. \"You brutes! You apes! You\nmiserable, white-skinned creatures! How dare you come into my garden\nand knock me on the head with that awful basket and then fall on my\ntoes and cause me pain and suffering? How dare you, I say? Don't you\nknow you will be punished for your impudence? Don't you know the\nBoolooroo of the Blues will have revenge? I can have you patched for\nthis insult, and I will--just as sure as I'm the Royal Boolooroo of Sky\nIsland!\"\n\n\"Oh, is this Sky Island, then?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Of course it's Sky Island. What else could it be? And I'm its Ruler,\nits King, its sole Royal Potentate and Dictator. Behold in the\nPersonage you have injured the Mighty Quitey Righty Boolooroo of the\nBlues!\" Here he strutted around in a very pompous manner and wagged his\nlittle head contemptuously at them.\n\n\"Glad to meet you, sir,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I allus had a likin' for\nkings, bein' as they're summat unusual. Please 'scuse me for a-sittin'\non your royal toes, not knowin' as your toes were there.\"\n\n\"I won't excuse you!\" roared the Boolooroo. \"But I'll punish you. You\nmay depend upon that.\"\n\n\"Seems to me,\" said Trot, \"you're actin' rather imperlite to strangers.\nIf anyone comes to our country to visit us, we always treat 'em decent.\"\n\n\"YOUR country!\" exclaimed the Boolooroo, looking at them more carefully\nand seeming interested in their appearance. \"Where in the Sky did you\ncome from, then, and where is your country located?\"\n\n\"We live on the Earth when we're at home,\" replied the girl.\n\n\"The Earth? Nonsense! I've heard of the Earth, my child, but it isn't\ninhabited. No one can live there because it's just a round, cold,\nbarren ball of mud and water,\" declared the Blueskin.\n\n\"Oh, you're wrong about that,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"You surely are,\" added Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Why, we live there ourselves,\" cried Trot.\n\n\"I don't believe it. I believe you are living in Sky Island, where you\nhave no right to be, with your horrid white skins. And you've intruded\ninto the private garden of the palace of the Greatly Stately Irately\nBoolooroo, which is a criminal offense. And you've bumped my head with\nyour basket and smashed my toes with your boards and bodies, which is a\ncrime unparalleled in all the history of Sky Island! Aren't you sorry\nfor yourselves?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for you,\" replied Trot, \"'cause you don't seem to know the\nproper way to treat visitors. But we won't stay long. We'll go home\npretty soon.\"\n\n\"Not until you have been punished!\" exclaimed the Boolooroo sternly.\n\"You are my prisoners.\"\n\n\"Beg parding, your Majesty,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"but you're takin' a good\ndeal for granted. We've tried to be friendly and peaceable, an' we've\n'poligized for hurtin' you, but if that don't satisfy you, you'll have\nto make the most of it. You may be the Boolooroo of the Blues, but you\nain't even a tin whistle to us, an' you can't skeer us for half a\nminute. I'm an ol' man, myself, but if you don't behave, I'll spank you\nlike I would a baby, an' it won't be any trouble at all to do it,\nthank'e. As a matter o' fact, we've captured your whole bloomin' blue\nisland, but we don't like the place very much, and I guess we'll give\nit back. It gives us the blues, don't it, Trot? So as soon as we eat a\nbite of lunch from our basket, we'll sail away again.\"\n\n\"Sail away? How?\" asked the Boolooroo.\n\n\"With the Magic Umbrel,\" said Cap'n Bill, pointing to the umbrella that\nButton-Bright was holding underneath his arm.\n\n\"Oh, ho! I see, I see,\" said the Boolooroo, nodding his funny head. \"Go\nahead, then, and eat your lunch.\"\n\nHe retreated a little way to a marble seat beside the fountain, but\nwatched the strangers carefully. Cap'n Bill, feeling sure he had won\nthe argument, whispered to the boy and girl that they must eat and get\naway as soon as possible, as this might prove a dangerous country for\nthem to remain in. Trot longed to see more of the strange blue island,\nand especially wanted to explore the magnificent blue palace that\nadjoined the garden and which had six hundred tall towers and turrets;\nbut she felt that her old friend was wise in advising them to get away\nquickly. So she opened the basket, and they all three sat in a row on a\nstone bench and began to eat sandwiches and cake and pickles and cheese\nand all the good things that were packed in the lunch basket.\n\nThey were hungry from the long ride, and while they ate they kept their\neyes busily employed in examining all the queer things around them. The\nBoolooroo seemed quite the queerest of anything, and Trot noticed that\nwhen he pulled the long curl that stuck up from the top of his head, a\nbell tinkled somewhere in the palace. He next pulled at the bottom of\nhis right ear, and another faraway bell tinkled; then he touched the\nend of his nose, and still another bell was faintly heard. The\nBoolooroo said not a word while he was ringing the bells, and Trot\nwondered if that was the way he amused himself. But now the frown died\naway from his face and was replaced with a look of satisfaction.\n\n\"Have you nearly finished?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No,\" said Trot, \"we've got to eat our apples yet.\"\n\n\"Apples? Apples? What are apples?\" he asked.\n\nTrot took some from the basket. \"Have one?\" she said. \"They're awful\ngood.\"\n\nThe Boolooroo advanced a step and took the apple, which he regarded\nwith much curiosity.\n\n\"Guess they don't grow anywhere but on the Earth,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Are they good to eat?\" asked the Boolooroo.\n\n\"Try it and see,\" answered Trot, biting into an apple herself.\n\nThe Blueskin sat down on the end of their bench, next to Button-Bright,\nand began to eat his apple. He seemed to like it, for he finished it in\na hurry, and when it was gone he picked up the Magic Umbrella.\n\n\"Let that alone!\" said Button-Bright, making a grab for it. But the\nBoolooroo jerked it away in an instant, and standing up he held the\numbrella behind him and laughed aloud.\n\n\"Now then,\" said he, \"you can't get away until I'm willing to let you\ngo. You are my prisoners.\"\n\n\"I guess not,\" returned Cap'n Bill, and reaching out one of his long\narms, the sailorman suddenly grasped the Boolooroo around his long,\nthin neck and shook him until his whole body fluttered like a flag.\n\"Drop that umbrel. Drop it!\" yelled Cap'n Bill, and the Boolooroo\nquickly obeyed. The Magic Umbrella fell to the ground, and\nButton-Bright promptly seized it. Then the sailor let go his hold and\nthe King staggered to a seat, choking and coughing to get his breath\nback.\n\n\"I told you to let things alone,\" growled Cap'n Bill. \"If you don't\nbehave, your Majesty, this Blue Island'll have to get another\nBoolooroo.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the Blueskin.\n\n\"Because I'll prob'ly spoil you for a king, an' mebbe for anything\nelse. Anyhow, you'll get badly damaged if you try to interfere with us,\nan' that's a fact.\"\n\n\"Don't kill him, Cap'n Bill,\" said Trot cheerfully.\n\n\"Kill me? Why, he couldn't do that,\" observed the King, who was trying\nto rearrange the ruffle around his neck. \"Nothing can kill me.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Because I haven't lived my six hundred years yet. Perhaps you don't\nknow that every Blueskin in Sky Island lives exactly six hundred years\nfrom the time he is born.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't know that,\" admitted the sailor.\n\n\"It's a fact,\" said the King. \"Nothing can kill us until we've lived to\nthe last day of our appointed lives. When the final minute is up, we\ndie; but we're obliged to live all of the six hundred years whether we\nwant to or not. So you needn't think of trying to kill anybody on Sky\nIsland. It can't be done.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I'm no murderer, thank goodness, and I\nwouldn't kill you if I could, much as you deserve it.\"\n\n\"But isn't six hundred years an awful long time to live?\" questioned\nTrot.\n\n\"It seems like it at first,\" replied the King, \"but I notice that\nwhenever any of my subjects get near the end of their six hundred, they\ngrow nervous and say the life is altogether too short.\"\n\n\"How long have you lived?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\nThe King coughed again and turned a bit bluer. \"That is considered an\nimpertinent question in Sky Island,\" he answered, \"but I will say that\nevery Boolooroo is elected to reign three hundred years, and I've\nreigned not quite--ahem!--two hundred.\"\n\n\"Are your kings elected, then?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Yes, of course. This is a Republic, you know. The people elect all\ntheir officers from the King down. Every man and every woman is a\nvoter. The Boolooroo tells them whom to vote for, and if they don't\nobey, they are severely punished. It's a fine system of government, and\nthe only thing I object to is electing the Boolooroo for only three\nhundred years. It ought to be for life. My successor has already been\nelected, but he can't reign for a hundred years to come.\"\n\n\"I think three hundred years is plenty long enough,\" said Trot. \"It\ngives someone else a chance to rule, an' I wouldn't be s'prised if the\nnext king is a better one. Seems to me you're not much of a Boolooroo.\"\n\n\"That,\" replied the King indignantly, \"is a matter of opinion. I like\nmyself very much, but I can't expect you to like me, because you're\ndeformed and ignorant.\"\n\n\"I'm not!\" cried Trot.\n\n\"Yes, you are. Your legs are too short and your neck is nothing at all.\nYour color is most peculiar, but there isn't a shade of blue about any\nof you, except the deep-blue color of the clothes the old ape that\nchoked me wears. Also, you are ignorant because you know nothing of Sky\nIsland, which is the Center of the Universe and the only place anyone\nwould care to live.\"\n\n\"Don't listen to him, Trot,\" said Button-Bright. \"He's an ignorant\nhimself.\"\n\nCap'n Bill packed up the lunch basket. One end of the rope was still\ntied to the handle of the basket, and the other end to his swing seat,\nwhich lay on the ground before them.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"let's go home. We've seen enough of this Blue Country\nand its Blue Boolooroo, I guess, an' it's a long journey back again.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Trot, jumping up.\n\nButton-Bright stood on the bench and held up the Magic Umbrella, so he\ncould open it, and the sailor had just attached the ropes when a thin\nblue line shot out from behind them and in a twinkling wound itself\naround the umbrella. At the same instant another blue cord wound itself\naround the boy's body, and others caught Trot and Cap'n Bill in their\ncoils, so that all had their arms pinned fast to their sides and found\nthemselves absolutely helpless.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nThe Boolooroo was laughing and dancing around in front of them as if\nwell pleased. For a moment the prisoners could not imagine what had\nhappened to them, but presently half a dozen Blueskins, resembling in\nshape and costume their ruler but less magnificently dressed, stepped\nin front of them and bowed low to the Boolooroo.\n\n\"Your orders, most Mighty, Flighty, Tight and Righty Monarch, have been\nobeyed,\" said the leader.\n\n\"Very well, Captain. Take that umbrella and carry it to my Royal\nTreasury. See that it is safely locked up. Here's the key, and if you\ndon't return it to me within five minutes, I'll have you patched.\"\n\nThe Captain took the key and the Magic Umbrella and hastened away to\nthe palace. Button-Bright had already hooked the ropes to the\nelephant-trunk handle, so that when the Captain carried away the\numbrella, he dragged after him first the double seat, then Cap'n Bill's\nseat, which was fastened to it, and finally the lunch-basket, which was\nattached to the lower seat. At every few steps some of these would trip\nup the Captain and cause him to take a tumble, but as he had only five\nminutes' time in which to perform his errand, he would scramble to his\nfeet again and dash along the path until a board or the basket tripped\nhim up again.\n\nThey all watched him with interest until he had disappeared within the\npalace, when the King turned to his men and said:\n\n\"Release the prisoners. They are now quite safe, and cannot escape me.\"\n\nSo the men unwound the long cords that were twined around the bodies of\nour three friends, and set them free. These men seemed to be soldiers,\nalthough they bore no arms except the cords. Each cord had a weight at\nthe end, and when the weight was skillfully thrown by a soldier, it\nwound the cord around anything in the twinkling of an eye and held fast\nuntil it was unwound again.\n\nTrot decided these Blueskins must have stolen into the garden when\nsummoned by the bells the Boolooroo had rung, but they had kept out of\nsight and crept up behind the bench on which our friends were seated\nuntil a signal from the king aroused them to action.\n\nThe little girl was greatly surprised by the suddenness of her capture,\nand so was Button-Bright. Cap'n Bill shook his head and said he was\nafeared they'd get into trouble. \"Our mistake,\" he added, \"was in\nstoppin' to eat our lunch. But it's too late now to cry over spilt\nmilk.\"\n\n\"I don't mind, not much anyhow,\" asserted Trot bravely. \"We're in no\nhurry to get back, are we, Button-Bright?\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" said the boy. \"If they hadn't taken the umbrella, I wouldn't\ncare how long we stopped in this funny island. Do you think it's a\nfairy country, Trot?\"\n\n\"Can't say, I'm sure,\" she answered. \"I haven't seen anything here yet\nthat reminds me of fairies, but Cap'n Bill said a floating island in\nthe sky was sure to be a fairyland.\"\n\n\"I think so yet, mate,\" returned the sailor. \"But there's all sorts o'\nfairies, I've heard. Some is good, an' some is bad, an' if all the\nBlueskins are like their Boolooroo, they can't be called fust-class.\"\n\n\"Don't let me hear any more impudence, prisoners!\" called the Boolooroo\nsternly. \"You are already condemned to severe punishment, and if I have\nany further trouble with you, you are liable to be patched.\"\n\n\"What's being patched?\" inquired the girl.\n\nThe soldiers all laughed at this question, but the King did not reply.\nJust then a door in the palace opened and out trooped a group of girls.\nThere were six of them, all gorgeously dressed in silken gowns with\nmany puffs and tucks and ruffles and flounces and laces and ribbons,\neverything being in some shade of blue, grading from light blue to deep\nblue. Their blue hair was elaborately dressed and came to a point at\nthe top of their heads. The girls approached in a line along the garden\npath, all walking with mincing steps and holding their chins high.\nTheir skirts prevented their long legs from appearing as grotesque as\ndid those of the men, but their necks were so thin and long that the\nruffles around them only made them seem the more absurd.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the King with a frown, \"here come the Six Snubnosed\nPrincesses, the most beautiful and aristocratic ladies in Sky Island.\"\n\n\"They're snubnosed, all right,\" observed Trot, looking at the girls\nwith much interest, \"but I should think it would make 'em mad to call\n'em that.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the Boolooroo in surprise. \"Is not a snub nose the highest\nmark of female beauty?\"\n\n\"Is it?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Most certainly. In this favored island, which is the Center of the\nUniverse, a snub nose is an evidence of high breeding which any lady\nwould be proud to possess.\"\n\nThe Six Snubnosed Princesses now approached the fountain and stood in a\nrow, staring with haughty looks at the strangers.\n\n\"Goodness me, your Majesty!\" exclaimed the first. \"What queer,\ndreadful-looking creatures are these? Where in all the Sky did they\ncome from?\"\n\n\"They say they came from the Earth, Cerulia,\" answered the Boolooroo.\n\n\"But that is impossible,\" said another Princess. \"Our scientists have\nproved that the Earth is not inhabited.\"\n\n\"Your scientists'll have to guess again, then,\" said Trot.\n\n\"But how did they get to Sky Island?\" inquired the third snubnosed one.\n\n\"By means of a Magic Umbrella, which I have captured and put away in my\nTreasure Chamber,\" replied the Boolooroo.\n\n\"What will you do with the monsters, papa?\" asked the fourth Princess.\n\n\"I haven't decided yet,\" said the Boolooroo. \"They're curiosities, you\nsee, and may serve to amuse us. But as they're only half civilized, I\nshall make them my slaves.\"\n\n\"What are they good for? Can they do anything useful?\" asked the fifth.\n\n\"We'll see,\" returned the King impatiently. \"I can't decide in a hurry.\nGive me time, Azure, give me time. If there's anything I hate, it's a\nhurry.\"\n\n\"I've an idea, your Majesty,\" announced the sixth Snubnosed Princess,\nwhose complexion was rather darker than that of her sisters, \"and it\nhas come to me quite deliberately, without any hurry at all. Let us\ntake the little girl to be our maid--to wait upon us and amuse us when\nwe're dull. All the other ladies of the court will be wild with envy,\nand if the child doesn't prove of use to us, we can keep her for a\nliving pincushion.\"\n\n\"Oh! Ah! That will be fine!\" cried all the other five, and the\nBoolooroo said:\n\n\"Very well, Indigo, it shall be as you desire.\" Then he turned to Trot\nand added, \"I present you to the Six Lovely Snubnosed Princesses, to be\ntheir slave. If you are good and obedient, you won't get your ears\nboxed oftener than once an hour.\"\n\n\"I won't be anybody's slave,\" protested Trot. \"I don't like these\nsnubnosed, fussy females, an' I won't have anything to do with 'em.\"\n\n\"How impudent!\" cried Cerulia.\n\n\"How vulgar!\" cried Turquoise.\n\n\"How unladylike!\" cried Sapphire.\n\n\"How silly!\" cried Azure.\n\n\"How absurd!\" cried Cobalt.\n\n\"How wicked!\" cried Indigo. And then all six held up their hands as if\nhorrified.\n\nThe Boolooroo laughed. \"You'll know how to bring her to time, I\nimagine,\" he remarked, \"and if the girl isn't reasonable and obedient,\nsend her to me and I'll have her patched. Now, then, take her away.\"\n\nBut Trot was obstinate and wouldn't budge a step. \"Keep us together,\nyour Majesty,\" begged Cap'n Bill. \"If we're to be slaves, don't\nseparate us, but make us all the same kind o' slaves.\"\n\n\"I shall do what pleases me,\" declared the Boolooroo angrily. \"Don't\ntry to dictate, old Moonface, for there's only one Royal Will in Sky\nIsland, and that's my own.\"\n\nHe then gave a command to a soldier, who hastened away to the palace\nand soon returned with a number of long, blue ribbons. One he tied\naround Trot's waist and then attached to it six other ribbons. Each of\nthe Six Snubnosed Princesses held the end of a ribbon, and then they\nturned and marched haughtily away to the palace, dragging the little\ngirl after them.\n\n\"Don't worry, Trot,\" cried Button-Bright. \"We'll get you out of this\ntrouble pretty soon.\"\n\n\"Trust to us, mate,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"We'll manage to take care o'\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right,\" answered Trot with fine courage. \"I'm not afraid\nof these gawkies.\"\n\nBut the princesses pulled her after them, and soon they had all\ndisappeared into one of the entrances to the Blue Palace.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said the Boolooroo. \"I will instruct you two in your\nfuture duties. I shall make old Moonface--\"\n\n\"My name's Cap'n Bill Weedles,\" interrupted the sailor.\n\n\"I don't care what your name is. I shall call you old Moonface,\"\nreplied the king, \"for that suits you quite well. I shall appoint you\nthe Royal Nectar Mixer to the court of Sky Island, and if you don't mix\nour nectar properly, I'll have you patched.\"\n\n\"How do you mix it?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"I don't mix it. It's not the Boolooroo's place to mix nectar,\" was the\nstern reply. \"But you may inquire of the palace servants, and perhaps\nthe Royal Chef or the Major-domo will condescend to tell you. Take him\nto the servants' quarters, Captain Ultramarine, and give him a suit of\nthe royal livery.\"\n\nSo Cap'n Bill was lad away by the chief of the soldiers, and when he\nhad gone, the king said to Button-Bright, \"You, slave, shall be the\nRoyal Bootblue. Your duty will be to keep the boots and shoes of the\nroyal family nicely polished with blue.\"\n\n\"I don't know how,\" answered Button-Bright surlily.\n\n\"You'll soon learn. The Royal Steward will supply you with blue paste,\nand when you've brushed this on our shoes, you must shine them with\nQ-rays of Moonshine. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Button-Bright.\n\nThen the Boolooroo told one of the soldiers to take the boy to the\nshoeblue den and have him instructed in his duties, and the soldiers\npromptly obeyed and dragged Button-Bright away to the end of the palace\nwhere the servants lived.\n\n\n\n\nGHIP-GHISIZZLE PROVES FRIENDLY\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nThe Royal Palace was certainly a magnificent building, with large and\nlofty rooms and superb furnishings, all being in shades of blue. The\nsoldier and the boy passed through several broad corridors and then\ncame to a big hall where many servants were congregated. These were\nstaring in bewilderment at Cap'n Bill, who had been introduced to them\nby Captain Ultramarine. Now they turned in no less surprise to examine\nthe boy, and their looks expressed not only astonishment but dislike.\n\nThe servants were all richly attired in blue silk liveries, and they\nseemed disposed to resent the fact that these strangers had been added\nto their ranks. They scowled and muttered and behaved in a very\nunfriendly way, even after Captain Ultramarine had explained that the\nnewcomers were merely base slaves, and not to be classed with the free\nroyal servants of the palace.\n\nOne of those present, however, showed no especial enmity to\nButton-Bright and Cap'n Bill, and this Blueskin attracted the boy's\nnotice because his appearance was so strange. He looked as if he were\nmade of two separate men, each cut through the middle and then joined\ntogether, half of one to half of the other. One side of his blue hair\nwas curly and the other half straight; one ear was big and stuck out\nfrom the side of his head, while the other ear was small and flat; one\neye was half shut and twinkling, while the other was big and staring;\nhis nose was thin on one side and flat on the other, while one side of\nhis mouth curled up and the other down. Button-Bright also noticed that\nhe limped as he walked because one leg was a trifle longer than the\nother, and that one hand was delicate and slender and the other thick\nand hardened by use.\n\n\"Don't stare at him,\" a voice whispered in the boy's ear. \"The poor\nfellow has been patched, that's all.\"\n\nButton-Bright turned to see who had spoken and found by his side a tall\nyoung Blueskin with a blue-gold chain around his neck. He was quite the\nbest looking person the boy had seen in Sky Island, and he spoke in a\npleasant way and seemed quite friendly. But the two-sided man had\noverheard the remark, and he now stepped forward and said in a careless\ntone:\n\n\"Never mind. It's no disgrace to be patched in a country ruled by such\na cruel Boolooroo as we have. Let the boy look at me if he wants to.\nI'm not pretty, but that's not my fault. Blame the Boolooroo.\"\n\n\"I--I'm glad to meet you, sir,\" stammered Button-Bright. \"What is your\nname, please?\"\n\n\"I'm now named Jimfred Jonesjinks, and my partner is called Fredjim\nJinksjones. He's busy at present guarding the Treasure Chamber, but\nI'll introduce you to him when he comes back. We've had the misfortune\nto be patched, you know.\"\n\n\"What is being patched?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"They cut two of us in halves and mismatch the halves--half of one to\nhalf of the other, you know--and then the other two halves are patched\ntogether. It destroys our individuality and makes us complex creatures,\nso it's the worst punishment than can be inflicted in Sky Island.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright, alarmed at such dreadful butchery. \"Doesn't\nit hurt?\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't hurt,\" replied Jimfred. \"But it makes one frightfully\nnervous. They stand you under a big knife, which drops and slices you\nneatly in two, exactly in the middle. Then they match half of you to\nanother person who has likewise been sliced, and there you are, patched\nto someone you don't care about and haven't much interest in. If your\nhalf wants to do something, the other half is likely to want to do\nsomething different, and the funny part of it is you don't quite know\nwhich is your half and which is the other half. It's a terrible\npunishment, and in a country where one can't die or be killed until he\nhas lived his six hundred years, to be patched is a great misfortune.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it is,\" said Button-Bright earnestly. \"But can't you ever\nget--get--UNpatched again?\"\n\n\"If the Boolooroo would consent, I think it could be done,\" Jimfred\nreplied, \"but he never will consent. This is about the meanest\nBoolooroo who ever ruled this land, and he was the first to invent\npatching people as a punishment. I think we will all be glad when his\nthree hundred years of rule are ended.\"\n\n\"When will that be?\" inquired the boy.\n\n\"Hush-sh-sh!\" cried everyone in a chorus, and they all looked over\ntheir shoulders as if frightened by the question. The officer with the\nblue-gold chain pulled Button-Bright's sleeve and whispered, \"Follow\nme, please.\" And then he beckoned to Cap'n Bill and led the two slaves\nto another room where they were alone.\n\n\"I must instruct you in your duties,\" said he when they were all\ncomfortably seated in cozy chairs with blue cushions. \"You must learn\nhow to obey the Boolooroo's commands, so he won't become angry and have\nyou patched.\"\n\n\"How could he patch US?\" asked the sailorman curiously.\n\n\"Oh, he'd just slice you all in halves and then patch half of the boy\nto half of the girl, and the other half to half of you, and the other\nhalf of you to the other half of the girl. See?\"\n\n\"Can't say I do,\" said Cap'n Bill, much bewildered. \"It's a reg'lar\nmix-up.\"\n\n\"That's what it's meant to be,\" explained the young officer.\n\n\"An' seein' as we're Earth folks, an' not natives of Sky Island, I've\nan idea the slicing machine would about end us, without bein' patched,\"\ncontinued the sailor.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright, \"so it would.\"\n\n\"While you are in this country, you can't die till you've lived six\nhundred years,\" declared the officer.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright. \"That's different, of course. But who are\nyou, please?\"\n\n\"My name is Ghip-Ghi-siz-zle. Can you remember it?\"\n\n\"I can 'member the 'sizzle,'\" said the boy, \"but I'm 'fraid the\nGwip--Grip--Glip--\"\n\n\"Ghip-Ghi-siz-zle\" repeated the officer slowly. \"I want you to remember\nmy name, because if you are going to live here, you are sure to hear of\nme a great many times. Can you keep a secret?\"\n\n\"I can try,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"I've kep' secrets--once in a while,\" asserted Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Well, try to keep this one. I'm to be the next Boolooroo of Sky\nIsland.\"\n\n\"Good for you!\" cried the sailor. \"I wish you was the Boolooroo now,\nsir. But it seems you've got to wait a hundred years or more afore you\ncan take his place.\"\n\nGhip-Ghisizzle rose to his feet and paced up and down the room for a\ntime, a frown upon his face. Then he halted and faced Cap'n Bill.\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"there lies all my trouble. I'm quite sure the present\nBoolooroo has reigned three hundred years next Thursday, but he claims\nit is only two hundred years, and as he holds the Royal Book of Records\nunder lock and key in the Royal Treasury, there is no way for us to\nprove he is wrong.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright. \"How old is the Boolooroo?\"\n\n\"He was two hundred years old when he was elected,\" replied\nGhip-Ghisizzle. \"If he has already reigned three hundred years as I\nsuspect, then he is now five hundred years old. You see, he is trying\nto steal another hundred years of rule so as to remain a tyrant all his\nlife.\"\n\n\"He don't seem as old as that,\" observed Cap'n Bill thoughtfully. \"Why,\nI'm only sixty myself, an' I guess I look twice as old as your king\ndoes.\"\n\n\"We do not show our age in looks,\" the officer answered. \"I am just\nabout your age, sir--sixty-two my next birthday--but I'm sure I don't\nlook as old as that.\"\n\n\"That's a fact,\" agreed Cap'n Bill. Then he turned to Button-Bright and\nadded, \"Don't that prove Sky Island is a fairy country as I said?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've known that all along,\" said the boy. \"The slicing and\npatching proves it, and so do lots of other things.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle, \"let us talk over your duties. It\nseems you must mix the royal nectar, Cap'n Bill. Do you know how to do\nthat?\"\n\n\"I'm free to say as I don't, friend Sizzle.\"\n\n\"The Boolooroo is very particular about his nectar. I think he has\ngiven you this job so he can find fault with you and have you punished.\nBut we will fool him. You are strangers here, and I don't want you\nimposed upon. I'll send Tiggle to the royal pantry and keep him there\nto mix the nectar. Then when the Boolooroo or the Queen or any of the\nSnubnosed Princesses call for a drink, you can carry it to them and it\nwill be sure to suit them.\"\n\n\"Thank'e sir,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"That's real kind of you.\"\n\n\"Your job, Button-Bright, is easier,\" continued Ghip-Ghisizzle.\n\n\"I'm no bootblack,\" declared the boy. \"The Boolooroo has no right to\nmake me do his dirty work.\"\n\n\"You're a slave,\" the officer reminded him, \"and a slave must obey.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"Because he can't help himself. No slave ever wants to obey, but he\njust has to. And it isn't dirty work at all. You don't black the royal\nboots and shoes, you merely blue them with a finely perfumed blue\npaste. Then you shine them neatly and your task is done. You will not\nbe humiliated by becoming a bootblack. You'll be a bootblue.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright. \"I don't see much difference, but perhaps\nit's a little more respectable.\"\n\n\"Yes, the Royal Bootblue is considered a high official in Sky Island.\nYou do your work at evening or early morning, and the rest of the day\nyou are at liberty to do as you please.\"\n\n\"It won't last long, Button-Bright,\" said Cap'n Bill consolingly.\n\"Somethin's bound to happen pretty soon, you know.\"\n\n\"I think so myself,\" answered the boy.\n\n\"And now,\" remarked Ghip-Ghisizzle, \"since you understand your new\nduties, perhaps you'd like to walk out with me and see the Blue City\nand the glorious Blue Country of Sky Island.\"\n\n\"We would that!\" cried Cap'n Bill promptly.\n\nSo they accompanied their new friend through a maze of passages--for\nthe palace was very big--and then through a high, arched portal into\nthe streets of the City. So rapid had been their descent when the\numbrella landed them in the royal garden that they had not even caught\na glimpse of the Blue City, so now they gazed with wonder and interest\nat the splendid sights that met their eyes.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLUE CITY\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nThe Blue City was quite extensive, and consisted of many broad streets\npaved with blue marble and lined with splendid buildings of the same\nbeautiful material. There were houses and castles and shops for the\nmerchants, and all were prettily designed and had many slender spires\nand imposing turrets that rose far into the blue air. Everything was\nblue here, just as was everything in the Royal Palace and gardens, and\na blue haze overhung all the city.\n\n\"Doesn't the sun ever shine?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Not in the blue part of Sky Island,\" replied Ghip-Ghisizzle. \"The moon\nshines here every night, but we never see the sun. I am told, however,\nthat on the other half of the Island--which I have never seen--the sun\nshines brightly but there is no moon at all.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright. \"Is there another half to Sky Island?'\n\n\"Yes, a dreadful place called the Pink Country. I'm told everything\nthere is pink instead of blue. A fearful place it must be, indeed!\"\nsaid the Blueskin with a shudder.\n\n\"I dunno 'bout that,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"That Pink Country sounds\nkind o' cheerful to me. Is your Blue Country very big?\"\n\n\"It is immense,\" was the proud reply. \"This enormous city extends a\nhalf mile in all directions from the center, and the country outside\nthe City is fully a half-mile further in extent. That's very big, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Not very,\" replied Cap'n Bill with a smile. \"We've cities on the Earth\nten times bigger, an' then some big besides. We'd call this a small\ntown in our country.\"\n\n\"Our Country is thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles\nlong--it's the great United States of America!\" added the boy earnestly.\n\nGhip-Ghisizzle seemed astonished. He was silent a moment, and then he\nsaid, \"Here in Sky Island we prize truthfulness very highly. Our\nBoolooroo is not very truthful, I admit, for he is trying to\nmisrepresent the length of his reign, but our people as a rule speak\nonly the truth.\"\n\n\"So do we,\" asserted Cap'n Bill. \"What Button-Bright said is the honest\ntruth, every word of it.\"\n\n\"But we have been led to believe that Sky Island is the greatest\ncountry in the universe--meaning, of course, our half of it, the Blue\nCountry.\"\n\n\"It may be for you, perhaps,\" the sailor stated politely. \"An' I don't\nimagine any island floatin' in the sky is any bigger. But the Universe\nis a big place, an' you can't be sure of what's in it till you've\ntraveled like we have.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" mused the Blueskin, but he still seemed to\ndoubt them.\n\n\"Is the Pink side of Sky Island bigger than the Blue side?\" asked\nButton-Bright.\n\n\"No, it is supposed to be the same size,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Then why haven't you ever been there? Seems to me you could walk\nacross the whole island in an hour,\" said the boy.\n\n\"The two parts are separated by an impassable barrier,\" answered\nGhip-Ghisizzle. \"Between them lies the Great Fog Bank.\"\n\n\"A fog bank? Why, that's no barrier!\" exclaimed Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"It is indeed,\" returned the Blueskin. \"The Fog Bank is so thick and\nheavy that it blinds one, and if once you got into the Bank, you might\nwander forever and not find your way out again. Also, it is full of\ndampness that wets your clothes and your hair until you become\nmiserable. It is furthermore said that those who enter the Fog Bank\nforfeit the six hundred years allowed them to live and are liable to\ndie at any time. Here we do not die, you know; we merely pass away.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" asked the sailor. \"Isn't 'pass'n' away' jus' the same as\ndyin'?\"\n\n\"No indeed. When our six hundred years are ended, we march into the\nGreat Blue Grotto, through the Arch of Phinis, and are never seen\nagain.\"\n\n\"That's queer,\" said Button-Bright. \"What would happen if you didn't\nmarch through the Arch?\"\n\n\"I do not know, for no one has ever refused to do so. It is the Law,\nand we all obey it.\"\n\n\"It saves funeral expenses, anyhow,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"Where is\nthis Arch?\"\n\n\"Just outside the gates of the City. There is a mountain in the center\nof the Blue land, and the entrance to the Great Blue Grotto is at the\nfoot of the mountain. According to our figures, the Boolooroo ought to\nmarch into this Grotto a hundred years from next Thursday, but he is\ntrying to steal a hundred years and so perhaps he won't enter the Arch\nof Phinis. Therefore, if you will please be patient for about a hundred\nyears, you will discover what happens to one who breaks the Law.\"\n\n\"Thank'e,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"I don't expect to be very curious a\nhundred years from now.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" added Button-Bright, laughing at the whimsical speech. \"But I\ndon't see how the Boolooroo is able to fool you all. Can't any of you\nremember two or three hundred years back when he first began to rule?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle, \"that's a long time to remember, and we\nBlueskins try to forget all we can, especially whatever is unpleasant.\nThose who remember are usually the unhappy ones; only those able to\nforget find the most joy in life.\"\n\nDuring this conversation they had been walking along the streets of the\nBlue City, where many of the Blueskin inhabitants stopped to gaze\nwonderingly at the sailor and the boy, whose strange appearance\nsurprised them. They were a nervous, restless people, and their\negg-shaped heads, set on the ends of long, thin necks, seemed so\ngrotesque to the strangers that they could scarcely forbear laughing at\nthem. The bodies of these people were short and round and their legs\nexceptionally long, so when a Blueskin walked, he covered twice as much\nground at one step as Cap'n Bill or Button-Bright did. The women seemed\njust as repellent as the men, and Button-Bright began to understand\nthat the Six Snubnosed Princesses were, after all, rather better\nlooking than most of the females of the Blue Country and so had a\ncertain right to be proud and haughty.\n\nThere were no horses nor cows in this land, but there were plenty of\nblue goats, from which the people got their milk. Children tended the\ngoats--wee Blueskin boys and girls whose appearance was so comical that\nButton-Bright laughed whenever he saw one of them.\n\nAlthough the natives had never seen before this any human beings made\nas Button-Bright and Cap'n Bill were, they took a strong dislike to the\nstrangers and several times threatened to attack them. Perhaps if\nGhip-Ghisizzle, who was their favorite, had not been present, they\nwould have mobbed our friends with vicious ill-will and might have\nseriously injured them. But Ghip-Ghisizzle's friendly protection made\nthem hold aloof.\n\nBy and by they passed through a City gate, and their guide showed them\nthe outer walls, which protected the City from the country beyond.\nThere were several of these gates, and from their recesses stone steps\nled to the top of the wall. They mounted a flight of these steps and\nfrom their elevation plainly saw the low mountain where the Arch of\nPhinis was located, and beyond that the thick, blue-gray Fog Bank,\nwhich constantly rolled like billows of the ocean and really seemed,\nfrom a distance, quite forbidding.\n\n\"But it wouldn't take long to get there,\" decided Button-Bright, \"and\nif you were close up, it might not be worse than any other fog. Is the\nPink Country on the other side of it?\"\n\n\"So we are told in the Book of Records,\" replied Ghip-Ghisizzle. \"None\nof us now living know anything about it, but the Book of Records calls\nit the 'Sunset Country' and says that at evening the pink shades are\ndrowned by terrible colors of orange and crimson and golden-yellow and\nred. Wouldn't it be horrible to be obliged to look upon such a sight?\nIt must give the poor people who live there dreadful headaches.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see that Book of Records,\" mused Cap'n Bill, who didn't\nthink the description of the Sunset Country at all dreadful.\n\n\"I'd like to see it myself,\" returned Ghip-Ghisizzle with a sigh, \"but\nno one can lay hands on it because the Boolooroo keeps it safely locked\nup in his Treasure Chamber.\"\n\n\"Where's the key to the Treasure Chamber?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"The Boolooroo keeps it in his pocket night and day,\" was the reply.\n\"He is afraid to let anyone see the Book because it would prove he has\nalready reigned three hundred years next Thursday, and then he would\nhave to resign the throne to me and leave the Palace and live in a\ncommon house.\"\n\n\"My Magic Umbrella is in that Treasure Chamber,\" said Button-Bright,\n\"and I'm going to try to get it.\"\n\n\"Are you?\" inquired Ghip-Ghisizzle eagerly. \"Well, if you manage to\nenter the Treasure Chamber, be sure to bring me the Book of Records. If\nyou can do that, I will be the best and most grateful friend you ever\nhad!\"\n\n\"I'll see,\" said the boy. \"It ought not to be hard work to break into\nthe Treasure chamber. Is it guarded?\"\n\n\"Yes. The outside guard is Jimfred Jinksjones, the double patch of the\nFredjim whom you have met, and the inside guard is a ravenous creature\nknown as the Blue Wolf, which has teeth a foot long and as sharp as\nneedles.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright. \"But never mind the Blue Wolf; I must manage\nto get my umbrella somehow or other.\"\n\nThey now walked back to the palace, still objects of much curiosity to\nthe natives, who sneered at them and mocked them but dared not\ninterfere with their progress. At the palace they found that dinner was\nabout to be served in the big dining hall of the servants and\ndependents and household officers of the royal Boolooroo.\nGhip-Ghisizzle was the Majordomo and Master of Ceremonies, so he took\nhis seat at the end of the long table and placed Cap'n Bill on one side\nof him and Button-Bright on the other, to the great annoyance of the\nother Blueskins present, who favored the strangers with nothing\npleasanter than envious scowls.\n\nThe Boolooroo and his Queen and daughters--the Six Snubnosed\nPrincesses--dined in formal state in the Banquet Hall, where they were\nwaited upon by favorite soldiers of the Royal Bodyguard. Here in the\nservants' hall there was one vacant seat next to Button-Bright which\nwas reserved for Trot; but the little girl had not yet appeared, and\nthe sailorman and the boy were beginning to be uneasy about her.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRIBULATION OF TROT\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nThe apartments occupied by the Six Snubnosed Princesses were so\nmagnificent that when Trot first entered them, led by her haughty\ncaptors, she thought they must be the most beautiful rooms in the\nworld. There was a long and broad reception room, with forty-seven\nwindows in it, and opening out of it were six lovely bedchambers, each\nfurnished in the greatest luxury. Adjoining each sleeping room was a\nmarble bath, and each Princess had a separate boudoir and a dressing\nroom. The furnishings were of the utmost splendor, blue-gold and blue\ngems being profusely used in the decorations, while the divans and\nchairs were of richly carved bluewood upholstered in blue satins and\nsilks. The draperies were superbly embroidered, and the rugs upon the\nmarble floors were woven with beautiful scenes in every conceivable\nshade of blue.\n\nWhen they first reached the reception room, Princess Azure cast herself\nupon a divan while her five sisters sat or reclined in easy chairs with\ntheir heads thrown back and their blue chins scornfully elevated. Trot,\nwho was much annoyed at the treatment she had received, did not\nhesitate to seat herself also in a big easy chair.\n\n\"Slave!\" cried Princess Cerulia, \"Fetch me a mirror.\"\n\n\"Slave!\" cried Princess Turquoise, \"A lock of my hair is loosened; bind\nit up.\"\n\n\"Slave!\" cried Princess Cobalt, \"Unfasten my shoes; they're too tight.\"\n\n\"Slave!\" cried Princess Sapphire, \"Bring hither my box of blue\nchocolates.\"\n\n\"Slave!\" cried Princess Azure, \"Stand by my side and fan me.\"\n\n\"Slave!\" cried Princess Indigo, \"Get out of that chair. How dare you\nsit in our presence?\"\n\n\"If you're saying all those things to me,\" replied Trot, \"you may as\nwell save your breath. I'm no slave.\" And she cuddled down closer in\nthe chair.\n\n\"You ARE a slave!\" shouted the six all together.\n\n\"I'm not!\"\n\n\"Our father, the Revered and Resplendent Royal Ruler of the Blues, has\nmade you our slave,\" asserted Indigo with a yawn.\n\n\"But he can't,\" objected the little girl. \"I'm some Royal an' Rapturous\nan' Ridic'lous myself, an' I won't allow any cheap Boolooroo to order\nme 'round.\"\n\n\"Are you of royal birth?\" asked Azure, seeming surprised.\n\n\"Royal! Why, I'm an American, Snubnoses, and if there's anything\nroyaler than an American, I'd like to know what it is.\"\n\nThe Princesses seemed uncertain what reply to make to this speech and\nbegan whispering together. Finally, Indigo said to Trot, \"We do not\nthink it matters what you were in your own country, for having left\nthere you have forfeited your rank. By recklessly intruding into our\ndomain, you have become a slave, and being a slave you must obey us or\nsuffer the consequences.\"\n\n\"What cons'quences?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Dare to disobey us and you will quickly find out,\" snapped Indigo,\nswaying her head from side to side on its long, swan-like neck like the\npendulum of a clock.\n\n\"I don't want any trouble,\" said Trot gravely. \"We came to Sky Island\nby mistake and wanted to go right away again; but your father wouldn't\nlet us. It isn't our fault we're still here, an' I'm free to say you're\na very dis'gree'ble an' horrid lot of people with no manners to speak\nof, or you'd treat us nicely.\"\n\n\"No impertinence!\" cried Indigo savagely.\n\n\"Why, it's the truth,\" replied Trot.\n\nIndigo made a rush and caught Trot by both shoulders. The Princess was\ntwice the little girl's size, and she shook her victim so violently\nthat Trot's teeth rattled together. Then Princess Cobalt came up and\nslapped one side of the slave's face, and Princess Turquoise ran\nforward and slapped the other side. Cerulia gave Trot a push one way,\nand Sapphire pushed her the other way, so the little girl was quite out\nof breath and very angry when finally her punishment ceased. She had\nnot been much hurt, though, and she was wise enough to understand that\nthese Princesses were all cruel and vindictive, so that her safest plan\nwas to pretend to obey them.\n\n\"Now then,\" commanded Princess Indigo, \"go and feed my little blue dog\nthat crows like a rooster.\"\n\n\"And feed my pretty blue cat that sings like a bird,\" said Princess\nAzure.\n\n\"And feed my soft, blue lamb that chatters like a monkey,\" said\nPrincess Cobalt.\n\n\"And feed my poetic blue parrot that barks like a dog,\" said Princess\nSapphire.\n\n\"And feed my fuzzy blue rabbit that roars like a lion,\" said Princess\nTurquoise.\n\n\"And feed my lovely blue peacock that mews like a cat,\" said Princess\nCerulia.\n\n\"Anything else?\" asked Trot, drawing a long breath.\n\n\"Not until you have properly fed our pets,\" replied Azure with a scowl.\n\n\"What do they eat, then?\"\n\n\"Meat!\"\n\n\"Milk!\"\n\n\"Clover!\"\n\n\"Seeds!\"\n\n\"Bread!\"\n\n\"Carrots!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Trot, \"where do you keep the menagerie?\"\n\n\"Our pets are in our boudoirs,\" said Indigo harshly. \"What a little\nfool you are!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Trot, pausing as she was about to leave the room, \"when\nI grow up I'll be as big a fool as any of you.\"\n\nThen she ran away to escape another shaking, and in the first boudoir\nshe found the little blue dog curled up on a blue cushion in a corner.\nTrot patted his head gently, and this surprised the dog, who was\naccustomed to cuffs and kicks. So he licked Trot's hand and wagged his\nfunny little tail and then straightened up and crowed like a rooster.\nThe girl was delighted with the queer doggie, and she found some meat\nin a cupboard and fed him out of her hand, patting the tiny creature\nand stroking his soft blue hair. The doggie had never in his life known\nanyone so kind and gentle, so when Trot went into the next boudoir, the\nanimal followed close at her heels, wagging his tail every minute.\n\nThe blue cat was asleep on a window seat, but it woke up when Trot\ntenderly took it in her lap and fed it milk from a blue-gold dish. It\nwas a pretty cat and instantly knew the little girl was a friend vastly\ndifferent from its own bad-tempered mistress, so it sang beautifully as\na bird sings, and both the cat and the dog followed Trot into the third\nboudoir.\n\nHere was a tiny baby lamb with fleece as blue as a larkspur and as soft\nas milk.\n\n\"Oh, you darling!\" cried Trot, hugging the little lamb tight in her\narms. At once the lamb began chattering just as a monkey chatters, only\nin the most friendly and grateful way, and Trot fed it a handful of\nfresh blue clover and smoothed and petted it until the lamb was eager\nto follow her wherever she might go.\n\nWhen she came to the fourth boudoir, a handsome blue parrot sat on a\nblue perch and began barking as if it were nearly starved. Then it\ncried out,\n\n  \"Rub-a-dub, dub,\n  Gimme some grub!\"\n\nTrot laughed and gave it some seeds, and while the parrot ate them she\nstroked gently his soft feathers. The bird seemed much astonished at\nthe unusual caress and turned upon the girl first one little eye and\nthen the other as if trying to discover why she was so kind. He had\nnever experienced kind treatment in all his life. So it was no wonder\nthat when the little girl entered the fifth boudoir she was followed by\nthe parrot, the lamb, the cat and the dog, who all stood beside her and\nwatched her feed the peacock, which she found strutting around and\nmewing like a cat for his dinner. Said the parrot,\n\n  \"I spy a peacock's eye\n  On every feather. I wonder why?\"\n\nThe peacock soon came to love Trot as much as the other bird and all\nthe beasts did, and it spread its tail and strutted after her into the\nnext boudoir, the sixth one. As she entered this room, Trot gave a\nstart of fear, for a terrible roar like the roar of a lion greeted her.\nBut there was no lion there; a fuzzy, blue rabbit was making all the\nnoise. \"For goodness sake keep quiet,\" said Trot. \"Here's a nice blue\ncarrot for you. The color seems all wrong, but it may taste jus' as\ngood as if it was red.\"\n\nEvidently it did taste good, for the rabbit ate it greedily. When it\nwas not roaring, the creature was so soft and fluffy that Trot played\nwith it and fondled it a long time after it had finished eating, and\nthe rabbit played with the cat and the dog and the lamb and did not\nseem a bit afraid of the parrot or the peacock. But all of a sudden in\npounced Princess Indigo with a yell of anger.\n\n\"So this is how you waste your time, is it?\" exclaimed the Princess,\nand grabbing Trot's arm, she jerked the girl to her feet and began\npushing her from the room. All the pets began to follow her, and seeing\nthis, Indigo yelled at them to keep back. As they paid no attention to\nthis command, the princess seized a basin of water and dashed the fluid\nover the beasts and birds, after which she renewed her attempt to push\nTrot from the room. The pets rebelled at such treatment, and believing\nthey ought to protect Trot, whom they knew to be their friend, they\nproceeded to defend her. The little blue dog dashed at Indigo and bit\nher right ankle, while the blue cat scratched her left leg with its\nclaws and the parrot flew upon her shoulder and pecked her ear. The\nlamb ran up and butted Indigo so that she stumbled forward on her face,\nwhen the peacock proceeded to pound her head with his wings. Indigo,\nscreaming with fright, sprang to her feet again, but the rabbit ran\nbetween her legs and tripped her up, all the time roaring loudly like a\nlion, and the dog crowed triumphantly, as a rooster crows, while the\ncat warbled noisily and the lamb chattered and the parrot barked and\nthe peacock screeched \"me-ow!\"\n\nAltogether, Indigo was, as Trot said, \"scared stiff,\" and she howled\nfor help until her sisters ran in and rescued her, pulling her through\nthe bedchamber into the reception room. When she was alone, Trot sat\ndown on the floor and laughed until the tears came to her eyes, and she\nhugged all the pets and kissed them every one and thanked them for\nprotecting her.\n\n  \"That's all right;\n  We like a fight,\"\n\ndeclared the parrot in reply.\n\nThe Princesses were horrified to find Indigo so scratched and bitten,\nand they were likewise amazed at the rebellion of their six pets, which\nthey had never petted, indeed, but kept in their boudoirs so they could\nabuse them whenever they felt especially wicked or ill-natured. None of\nthe snubnosed ones dared enter the room where the girl was, but they\ncalled through a crack in the door for Trot to come out instantly.\nTrot, pretending not to hear, paid no attention to these demands.\n\nFinding themselves helpless and balked of their revenge, the Six\nSnubnosed Princesses finally recovered from their excitement and\nsettled down to a pleasant sisterly quarrel, as was their customary\namusement. Indigo wanted to have Trot patched, and Cerulia wanted her\nbeaten with knotted cords, and Cobalt wanted her locked up in a dark\nroom, and Sapphire wanted her fed on sand, and Turquoise wanted her\nbound to a windmill, and so between these various desires, they\nquarreled and argued until dinner time arrived.\n\nTrot was occupying Indigo's room, so that Princess was obliged to dress\nwith Azure, not daring to enter her own chamber, and the two sisters\nquarreled so enthusiastically that they almost came to blows before\nthey were ready for dinner.\n\nBefore the Six Snubnosed Princesses went to the Royal Banquet Hall,\nCobalt stuck her head through a crack of the door and said to Trot, \"If\nyou want any dinner, you'll find it in the servants' hall. I advise you\nto eat, for after our dinner we will decide upon a fitting punishment\nfor you, and then I'm sure you won't have much appetite.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied the girl. \"I'm right hungry, jus' now.\" She waited\nuntil the snubnosed sextette had pranced haughtily away, and then she\ncame out, followed by all the pets, and found her way to the servants'\nquarters.\n\n\n\n\nTHE KING'S TREASURE CHAMBER\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\nAll the Blueskins assembled in the servants' hall were amazed to see\nthe pets of the Princesses trailing after the strange little girl, but\nTrot took her place next to Button-Bright at the table, and the parrot\nperched upon her shoulder, while the peacock stood upon one side of her\nchair, and the lamb upon the other, and the cat and dog lay at her feet\nand the blue rabbit climbed into her lap and cuddled down there. Some\nof the Blueskins insisted that the animals and birds must be put out of\nthe room, but Ghip-Ghisizzle said they could remain, as they were the\nfavored pets of the lovely Snubnosed Princesses.\n\nCap'n Bill was delighted to see his dear little friend again, and so\nwas Button-Bright, and now that they were reunited--for a time, at\nleast--they paid little heed to the sour looks and taunting remarks of\nthe ugly Blueskins and ate heartily of the dinner, which was really\nvery good.\n\nThe meal was no sooner over than Ghip-Ghisizzle was summoned to the\nchamber of his Majesty the Boolooroo, but before he went away, he took\nTrot and Cap'n Bill and Button-Bright into a small room and advised\nthem to stay there until he returned so that the servants and soldiers\nwould not molest them. \"My people seem to dislike strangers,\" said the\nMajordomo thoughtfully, \"and that surprises me because you are the\nfirst strangers they have ever seen. I think they imagine you will\nbecome favorites of the Boolooroo and of the Princesses, and that is\nwhy they are jealous and hate you.\"\n\n\"They needn't worry 'bout that,\" replied Trot. \"The Snubnoses hate me\nworse than the people do.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine a bootblue becoming a royal favorite,\" grumbled\nButton-Bright.\n\n\"Or a necktie mixer,\" added Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"You don't mix neckties; you're a nectar mixer,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle\ncorrecting the sailor. \"I'll not be gone long, for I'm no favorite of\nthe Boolooroo, either, so please stay quietly in this room until my\nreturn.\"\n\nThe Majordomo found the Boolooroo in a bad temper. He had finished his\ndinner, where his six daughters had bitterly denounced Trot all through\nthe meal and implored their father to invent some new and terrible\npunishment for her. Also, his wife, the Queen, had made him angry by\nbegging for gold to buy ribbons with. Then, when he had retired to his\nown private room, he decided to send for the umbrella he had stolen\nfrom Button-Bright and test its magic powers. But the umbrella, in his\nhands, proved just as common as any other umbrella might be. He opened\nit and closed it, and turned it this way and that, commanding it to do\nall sorts of things, but of course the Magic Umbrella would obey no one\nbut a member of the family that rightfully owned it. At last the\nBoolooroo threw it down and stamped upon it and then kicked it into a\ncorner, where it rolled underneath a cabinet. Then he sent for\nGhip-Ghisizzle.\n\n\"Do you know how to work that Magic Umbrella?\" he asked the Majordomo.\n\n\"No, your Majesty, I do not,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Well, find out. Make the Whiteskins tell you so that I can use it for\nmy own amusement.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, your Majesty,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle.\n\n\"You'll do more than that, or I'll have you patched!\" roared the angry\nBoolooroo. \"And don't waste any time, either, for as soon as we find\nout the secret of the umbrella I'm going to have the three strangers\nmarched through the Arch of Phinis, and that will be the end of them.\"\n\n\"You can't do that, your Majesty,\" said the Majordomo.\n\n\"Why can't I?\"\n\n\"They haven't lived six hundred years yet, and only those who have\nlived that length of time are allowed to march through the Arch of\nPhinis into the Great Blue Grotto.\"\n\nThe King looked at him with a sneer. \"Has anyone ever come out of that\nArch alive?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Ghip-ghisizzle, \"but no one has ever gone into the Blue\nGrotto until his allotted time was up.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going to try the experiment,\" declared the Boolooroo. \"I\nshall march these three strangers through the Arch, and if by chance\nthey come out alive, I'll do a new sort of patching--I'll chop off\ntheir heads and mix 'em up, putting the wrong head on each of 'em. Ha,\nha! Won't it be funny to see the old Moonface's head on the little\ngirl? Ho, ho! I really hope they'll come out of the Great Blue Grotto\nalive!\"\n\n\"I also hope they will,\" replied Ghip-Ghisizzle.\n\n\"Then I'll bet you four buttonholes they don't. I've a suspicion that\nonce they enter the Great Blue Grotto that's the last of them.\"\n\nGhip-Ghisizzle went away quite sad and unhappy. He did not approve the\nway the strangers were being treated and thought it was wicked and\ncruel to try to destroy them.\n\nDuring his absence, the prisoners had been talking together very\nearnestly. \"We must get away from here somehow 'r other,\" said Cap'n\nBill, \"but o' course we can't stir a step without the Magic Umbrel.\"\n\n\"No, I must surely manage to get my umbrella first,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"Do it quick, then,\" urged Trot, \"for I can't stand those snubnoses\nmuch longer.\"\n\n\"I'll do it tonight,\" said the boy.\n\n\"The sooner, the better, my lad,\" remarked the sailor, \"but seein' as\nthe Blue Boolooroo has locked it up in his Treasure Chamber, it mayn't\nbe easy to get hold of.\"\n\n\"No, it won't be easy,\" Button-Bright admitted. \"But it has to be done,\nCap'n Bill, and there's no use waiting any longer. No one here likes\nus, and in a few days they may make an end of us.\"\n\n\"Oh, Button-Bright! There's a Blue Wolf in the Treasure Chamber!\"\nexclaimed Trot.\n\n\"Yes, I know.\"\n\n\"An' a patched man on guard outside,\" Cap'n Bill reminded him.\n\n\"I know,\" repeated Button-Bright.\n\n\"And the key's in the King's own pocket,\" added Trot despairingly.\n\nThe boy nodded. He didn't say how he would overcome all these\ndifficulties, so the little girl feared they would never see the Magic\nUmbrella again. But their present position was a very serious one, and\neven Cap'n Bill dared not advise Button-Bright to give up the desperate\nattempt.\n\nWhen Ghip-Ghisizzle returned, he said, \"You must be very careful not to\nanger the Boolooroo, or he may do you a mischief. I think the little\ngirl had better keep away from the Princesses for tonight unless they\ndemand her presence. The boy must go for the King's shoes and blue them\nand polish them and then take them back to the Royal Bedchamber. Cap'n\nBill won't have anything to do, for I've ordered Tiggle to mix the\nnectar.\"\n\n\"Thank 'e, friend Sizzle,\" said Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Now follow me, and I will take you to your rooms.\"\n\nHe led them to the rear of the palace, where he gave them three small\nrooms on the ground floor, each having a bed in it. Cap'n Bill's room\nhad a small door leading out into the street of the City, but Ghip\nGhisizzle advised him to keep this door locked, as the city people\nwould be sure to hurt the strangers if they had the chance to attack\nthem.\n\n\"You're safer in the palace than anywhere else,\" said the Majordomo,\n\"for there is no way you can escape from the island, and here the\nservants and soldiers dare not injure you for fear of the Boolooroo.\"\n\nHe placed Trot and her six pets--which followed her wherever she\nwent--in one room, and Cap'n Bill in another, and took Button-Bright\naway with him to show the boy the way to the King's bedchamber. As they\nproceeded, they passed many rooms with closed doors, and before one of\nthese a patched Blueskin was pacing up and down in a tired and sleepy\nway. It was Jimfred Jinksjones, the double of the Fredjim Jonesjinks\nthey had talked with in the servants' hall, and he bowed low before the\nMajordomo.\n\n\"This is the King's new bootblue, a stranger who has lately arrived\nhere,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle, introducing the boy to the patched man.\n\n\"I'm sorry for him,\" muttered Jimfred. \"He's a queer-looking chap, with\nhis pale yellow skin, and I imagine our cruel Boolooroo is likely to\npatch him before long, as he did me--I mean us.\"\n\n\"No he won't,\" said Button-Bright positively. \"The Boolooroo's afraid\nof me.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's different,\" said Jimfred. \"You're the first person I ever\nknew that could scare our Boolooroo.\"\n\nThey passed on, and Ghip-Ghisizzle whispered, \"That is the Royal\nTreasure Chamber.\" Button-Bright nodded. He had marked the place well\nso he couldn't miss it when he wanted to find it again. When they came\nto the King's apartments there was another guard before the door, this\ntime a long-necked soldier with a terrible scowl.\n\n\"This slave is the Royal Bootblue,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle to the guard.\n\"You will allow him to pass into his Majesty's chamber to get the royal\nshoes and to return them when they are blued.\"\n\n\"All right,\" answered the guard. \"Our Boolooroo is in an ugly mood\ntonight. It will go hard with this little short-necked creature if he\ndoesn't polish the shoes properly.\"\n\nThen Ghip-Ghisizzle left Button-Bright and went away, and the boy\npassed through several rooms to the Royal Bedchamber, where his Majesty\nsat undressing.\n\n\"Hi, there! What are you doing here?\" he roared as he saw Button-Bright.\n\n\"I've come for the shoes,\" said the boy.\n\nThe king threw them at his head, aiming carefully, but Button-Bright\ndodged the missiles, and one smashed a mirror while the other shattered\na vase on a small table. His Majesty looked around for something else\nto throw, but the boy seized the shoes and ran away, returning to his\nown room.\n\nWhile he polished the shoes he told his plans to Cap'n Bill and Trot\nand asked them to be ready to fly with him as soon as he returned with\nthe Magic Umbrella. All they need to do was to step out into the\nstreet, through the door of Cap'n Bill's room, and open the umbrella.\nFortunately, the seats and the lunch-basket were still attached to the\nhandle--or so they thought--and there would be nothing to prevent their\nquickly starting on the journey home.\n\nThey waited a long time, however, to give the Boolooroo time to get to\nsleep, so it was after midnight when Button-Bright finally took the\nshoes in his hand and started for the Royal Bedchamber. He passed the\nguard of the Royal Treasury and Fredjim nodded good-naturedly to the\nboy. But the sleepy guard before the King's apartments was cross and\nsurly.\n\n\"What are you doing here at this hour?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm returning his Majesty's shoes,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"Go back and wait till morning,\" commanded the guard.\n\n\"If you prevent me from obeying the Boolooroo's orders,\" returned the\nboy quietly, \"he will probably have you patched.\"\n\nThis threat frightened the long-necked guard, who did not know what\norders the Boolooroo had given his Royal Bootblue. \"Go in, then,\" said\nhe, \"but if you make a noise and waken his Majesty, the chances are\nyou'll get yourself patched.\"\n\n\"I'll be quiet,\" promised the boy.\n\nIndeed, Button-Bright had no desire to waken the Boolooroo, whom he\nfound snoring lustily with the curtains of his high-posted bed drawn\ntightly around him. The boy had taken off his own shoes after he passed\nthe guard and now he tiptoed carefully into the room, set down the\nroyal shoes very gently and then crept to the chair where his Majesty's\nclothes were piled. Scarcely daring to breathe for fear of awakening\nthe terrible monarch, the boy searched in the royal pockets until he\nfound a blue-gold key attached to a blue-gold chain. At once he decided\nthis must be the key to the Treasure Chamber, but in order to make sure\nhe searched in every other pocket--without finding another key.\n\nThen Button-Bright crept softly out of the room again, and in one of\nthe outer rooms he sat down near a big cabinet and put on his shoes.\nPoor Button-Bright did not know that lying disregarded beneath that\nvery cabinet at his side was the precious umbrella he was seeking, or\nthat he was undertaking a desperate adventure all for nothing. He\npassed the long-necked guard again, finding the man half asleep, and\nthen made his way to the Treasure Chamber. Facing Jimfred, he said to\nthe patched man in a serious tone, \"His Majesty commands you to go at\nonce to the corridor leading to the apartments of the Six Snubnosed\nPrincesses and to guard the entrance until morning. You are to permit\nno one to enter or leave the apartments.\"\n\n\"But--good gracious!\" exclaimed the surprised Jimfred. \"Who will guard\nthe Treasure Chamber?\"\n\n\"I am to take your place,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" replied Jimfred. \"This is a queer freak for our\nBoolooroo to indulge in, but he is always doing something absurd.\nYou're not much of a guard, seems to me, but if anyone tries to rob the\nTreasure Chamber you must ring this big gong, which will alarm the\nwhole palace and bring the soldiers to your assistance. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Button-Bright.\n\nThen Fredjim stalked away to the other side of the palace to guard the\nPrincesses, and Button-Bright was left alone with the key to the\nTreasure Chamber in his hand. But he had not forgotten that the\nferocious Blue Wolf was guarding the interior of the Chamber, so he\nsearched in some of the rooms until he found a sofa-pillow, which he\nput under his arm and then returned to the corridor.\n\nHe placed the key in the lock, and the bolt turned with a sharp click.\nButton-Bright did not hesitate. He was afraid, to be sure, and his\nheart was beating fast with the excitement of the moment, but he knew\nhe must regain the Magic Umbrella if he would save his comrades and\nhimself from destruction, for without it they could never return to the\nEarth. So he summoned up his best courage, opened the door, stepped\nquickly inside, and closed the door after him.\n\n\n\n\nBUTTON-BRIGHT ENCOUNTERS THE BLUE WOLF\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\nA low, fierce growl greeted him. The Treasure Chamber was pretty dark,\nalthough the moonlight came in through some of the windows, but the boy\nhad brought with him the low brass lamp that lighted the corridor, and\nthis he set upon a table beside the door before he took time to look\naround him.\n\nThe Treasure Chamber was heaped and crowded with all the riches the\nBoolooroo had accumulated during his reign of two or three hundred\nyears. Piles of gold and jewels were on all sides, and precious\nornaments and splendid cloths, rare pieces of carved furniture, vases,\nbric-a-brac and the like, were strewn about the room in astonishing\nprofusion.\n\nJust at the boy's feet crouched a monstrous animal of most fearful\naspect. He knew at a glance it was the terrible Blue Wolf, and the\nsight of the beast sent a shiver through him. The Blue Wolf's head was\nfully as big as that of a lion, and its wide jaws were armed with rows\nof long, pointed teeth. His shoulders and front legs were huge and\npowerful, but the rest of the wolf's body dwindled away until at the\ntail it was no bigger than a dog. The jaws were therefore the dangerous\npart of the creature, and its small blue eyes flashed wickedly at the\nintruder.\n\nJust as the boy made his first step forward, the Blue Wolf sprang upon\nhim with its enormous jaws stretched wide open. Button-Bright jammed\nthe sofa-pillow into the brute's mouth and crowded it in as hard as he\ncould. The terrible teeth came together and buried themselves in the\npillow, and then Mr. Wolf found he could not pull them out\nagain--because his mouth was stuffed full. He could not even growl or\nyelp, but rolled upon the floor trying in vain to release himself from\nthe conquering pillow.\n\nButton-Bright paid no further attention to the helpless animal, but\ncaught up the blue-brass lamp and began a search for his umbrella. Of\ncourse he could not find it, as it was not there. He came across a\nsmall book bound in light-blue leather which lay upon an exquisitely\ncarved center-table. It was named, in dark-blue letters stamped on the\nleather, \"The Royal Record Book,\" and remembering Ghip-Ghisizzle longed\nto possess this book, Button-Bright hastily concealed it inside his\nblouse. Then he renewed his search for the umbrella, but it was quite\nin vain. He hunted in every crack and corner, bumbling the treasures\nhere and there in the quest, but at last he became positive that the\nMagic Umbrella was not there.\n\nThe boy was bitterly disappointed and did not know what to do next. But\nhe noticed that the Blue Wolf had finally seized an edge of the\nsofa-pillow in its sharp claws and was struggling to pull the thing out\nof his mouth; so, there being no object in his remaining longer in the\nroom where he might have to fight the wolf again, Button-Bright went\nout and locked the door behind him.\n\nWhile he stood in the corridor wondering what to do next, a sudden\nshouting reached his ears. It was the voice of the Boolooroo, saying\n\"My Key, my Key! Who has stolen my golden Key?\" And then there followed\nshouts of soldiers and guards and servants, and the rapid pattering of\nfeet was heard throughout the palace.\n\nButton-Bright took to his heels and ran along the passages until he\ncame to Cap'n Bill's room, where the sailorman and Trot were anxiously\nawaiting him.\n\n\"Quick!\" cried the boy. \"We must escape from here at once, or we will\nbe caught and patched.\"\n\n\"Where's the umbrel?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"I don't know. I can't find it. But all the palace is aroused, and the\nBoolooroo is furious. Come, let's get away at once!\"\n\n\"Where'll we go?\" inquired Trot.\n\n\"We must make for the open country and hide in the Fog Bank or in the\nArch of Phinis,\" replied the boy.\n\nThey did not stop to argue any longer, but all three stepped out of the\nlittle door into the street, where they first clasped hands so they\nwould not get separated in the dark, and then ran as swiftly as they\ncould down the street, which was deserted at this hour by the citizens.\nThey could not go very fast because the sailorman's wooden leg was\nawkward to run with and held them back, but Cap'n Bill hobbled quicker\nthan he had ever hobbled before in all his life, and they really made\npretty good progress.\n\nThey met no one on the streets and continued their flight until at last\nthey came to the City Wall, which had a blue-iron gate in it. Here was\na Blueskin guard, who had been peacefully slumbering when aroused by\nthe footsteps of the fugitives. \"Halt!\" cried the guard fiercely.\n\nCap'n Bill halted long enough to grab the man around his long neck with\none hand and around his long leg with the other hand. Then he raised\nthe Blueskin in the air and threw him far over the wall. A moment later\nthey had unfastened the gate and fled into the open country, where they\nheaded toward the low mountain whose outlines were plainly visible in\nthe moonlight.\n\nThe guard was now howling and crying for help. In the city were\nanswering shouts. A hue and cry came from every direction, reaching as\nfar as the palace. Lights began to twinkle everywhere in the streets,\nand the Blue city hummed like a beehive filled with angry bees. \"It\nwon't do for us to get caught now,\" panted Cap'n Bill as they ran\nalong. \"I'm more afeared o' them Blue citizens ner I am 'o the Blue\nBoolooroo. They'd tear us to pieces if they could.\"\n\nSky Island was not a very big place, especially the blue part of it,\nand our friends were now very close to the low mountain. Presently they\npaused before a grim archway of blue marble, above which was carved the\none word, \"Phinis.\" The interior seemed dark and terrible as they\nstopped to regard it as a possible place of refuge.\n\n\"Don't like that place, Cap'n,\" whispered Trot.\n\n\"No more do I, mate,\" he answered.\n\n\"I think I'd rather take a chance on the Fog Bank,\" said Button-Bright.\n\nJust then they were all startled by a swift flapping of wings, and a\nvoice cried in shrill tones,\n\n\"Where are you, Trot? As like as not I've been forgot!\"\n\nCap'n Bill jumped this way and Button-Bright that, and then there\nalighted on Trot's shoulder the blue parrot that had been the pet of\nthe Princess Cerulia. Said the bird,\n\n  \"Gee! I've flown\n  Here all alone.\n  It's pretty far,\n  But here we are!\"\n\nand then he barked like a dog and chuckled with glee at having found\nhis little friend.\n\nIn escaping the palace, Trot had been obliged to leave all the pets\nbehind her, but it seemed that the parrot had found some way to get\nfree and follow her. They were all astonished to hear the bird\ntalk--and in poetry, too--but Cap'n Bill told Trot that some parrots he\nhad known had possessed a pretty fair gift of language, and he added\nthat this blue one seemed an unusually bright bird. \"As fer po'try,\"\nsaid he, \"that's as how you look at po'try. Rhymes come from your head,\nbut real po'try from your heart, an' whether the blue parrot has a\nheart or not, he's sure got a head.\"\n\nHaving decided not to venture into the Arch of Phinis, they again\nstarted on, this time across the country straight toward the Fog Bank,\nwhich hung like a blue-grey cloud directly across the center of the\nisland. They knew they were being followed by bands of the Blueskins,\nfor they could hear the shouts of their pursuers growing louder and\nlouder every minute, since their long legs covered the ground more\nquickly than our friends could possibly go. Had the journey been much\nfarther, the fugitives would have been overtaken, but when the leaders\nof the pursuing Blueskins were only a few yards behind them, they\nreached the edge of the Fog Bank and without hesitation plunged into\nits thick mist, which instantly hid them from view.\n\nThe Blueskins fell back, horrified at the mad act of the strangers. To\nthem the Fog Bank was the most dreadful thing in existence, and no\nBlueskin had ever ventured within it even for a moment.\n\n\"That's the end of those short-necked Yellowskins,\" said one, shaking\nhis head. \"We may as well go back and report the matter to the\nBoolooroo.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHROUGH THE FOG BANK\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\nIt was rather moist in the Fog Bank. \"Seems like a reg'lar drizzle,\"\nsaid Trot. \"I'll be soaked through in a minute.\" She had been given a\ncostume of blue silk in exchange for her own dress, and the silk was so\nthin that the moisture easily wetted it.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"When it's a case of life 'n' death,\nclo's don't count for much. I'm sort o' drippy myself.\"\n\nCried the parrot, fluttering his feathers to try to keep them from\nsticking together,\n\n  \"Floods and gushes fill our path--\n  This is not my day for a bath!\n  Shut if off, or fear my wrath.\"\n\n\"We can't,\" laughed Trot. \"We'll jus' have to stick it out till we get\nto the other side.\"\n\n\"Had we better go to the other side?\" asked Button-Bright anxiously.\n\n\"Why not?\" returned Cap'n Bill. \"The other side's the only safe side\nfor us.\"\n\n\"We don't know that, sir,\" said the boy. \"Ghip-Ghisizzle said it was a\nterrible country.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" retorted the sailor stoutly. \"Sizzle's never been\nthere, an' he knows nothing about it. 'The Sunset Country' sounds sort\no' good to me.\"\n\n\"But how'll we ever manage to get there?\" inquired Trot. \"Aren't we\nalready lost in this fog?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I've kep' my face turned straight ahead\never since we climbed inter this bank o' wetness. If we don't get\ntwisted any, we'll go straight through to the other side.\"\n\nIt was no darker in the Fog Bank than it had been in the Blue Country.\nThey could see dimly the mass of fog, which seemed to cling to them,\nand when they looked down, they discovered that they were walking upon\nwhite pebbles that were slightly tinged with the blue color of the sky.\nGradually this blue became fainter until, as they progressed,\neverything became a dull gray.\n\n\"I wonder how far it is to the other side,\" remarked Trot wearily.\n\n\"We can't say till we get there, mate,\" answered the sailor in a\ncheerful voice. Cap'n Bill had a way of growing more and more cheerful\nwhen danger threatened.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said the girl. \"I'm as wet as a dishrag now, and I'll\nnever get any wetter.\"\n\n  \"Wet, wet, wet!\n  It's awful wet, you bet!\"\n\nmoaned the parrot on her shoulder.\n\n  \"I'm a fish-pond, I'm a well;\n  I'm a clam without a shell!\"\n\n\"Can't you dry up?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n  \"Not this evening, thank you, sir;\n  To talk and grumble I prefer,\"\n\nreplied the parrot dolefully.\n\nThey walked along more slowly now, still keeping hold of hands, for\nalthough they were anxious to get through the Fog Bank, they were tired\nwith the long run across the country and with their day's adventures.\nThey had no sleep and it was a long time past midnight.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried the parrot sharply; and they all halted to find a\nmonstrous frog obstructing their path. Cap'n Bill thought it was as big\nas a whale, and as it squatted on the gray pebbles, its eyes were on a\nlevel with those of the old sailor.\n\n\"Ker-chug, herk-choo!\" grunted the frog. \"What in the Sky is THIS\ncrowd?\"\n\n\"W-we're strangers,\" stammered Trot, \"an' we're tryin' to 'scape from\nthe Blueskins an' get into the Pink Country.\"\n\n\"I don't blame you,\" said the frog in a friendly tone. \"I hate those\nBlueskins. The Pinkies, however, are very decent neighbors.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm glad to hear that!\" cried Button-Bright. \"Can you tell us,\nMister--Mistress--good Mr. Frog--eh, eh, your Royal Highness, if we're\non the right road to the Pink Country?\"\n\nThe frog seemed to laugh, for he gurgled in his throat in a very funny\nway. \"I'm no Royal Highness,\" he said. \"I'm just a common frog, and a\nlittle wee tiny frog, too. But I hope to grow in time. This Fog Bank is\nthe Paradise of Frogs, and our King is about ten times as big as I am.\"\n\n\"Then he's a big 'un, an' no mistake,\" admitted Cap'n Bill. \"I'm glad\nyou like your country, but it's a mite too damp for us, an' we'd be\nglad to get out of it.\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" said the frog. \"I'll lead you to the border. It's only\nabout six jumps.\" He turned around, made a mighty leap and disappeared\nin the gray mist. Our friends looked at one another in bewilderment.\n\n\"Don't see how we can foller that lead,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"but we\nmay as well start in the same direction.\"\n\n  \"Brooks and creeks,\n  How it leaks!\"\n\nmuttered the parrot.\n\n  \"How can we jog\n  To a frog in the fog?\"\n\nThe big frog seemed to understand their difficulty, for he kept making\nnoises in his throat to guide them to where he had leaped. When at last\nthey came up to him, he made a second jump--out of sight, as\nbefore--and when they attempted to follow, they found a huge lizard\nlying across the path. Cap'n Bill thought it must be a giant alligator\nat first, it was so big, but he looked at them sleepily and did not\nseem at all dangerous.\n\n\"O, Liz--you puffy Liz--Get out of our way and mind your biz,\" cried\nthe parrot.\n\n  \"Creep-a-mousie, crawl-a-mousie, please move on!\n  We can't move a step till you are gone.\"\n\n\"Don't disturb me,\" said the lizard. \"I'm dreaming about parsnips. Did\nyou ever taste a parsnip?\"\n\n\"We're in a hurry, if it's the same to you, sir,\" said Cap'n Bill\npolitely.\n\n\"Then climb over me or go around, I don't care which,\" murmured the\nlizard. \"When they're little, they're juicy; when they're big, there's\nmore of 'em; but either way there's nothing so delicious as a parsnip.\nThere are none here in the Fog Bank, so the best I can do is dream of\nthem. Oh, parsnips, par-snips, p-a-r-snips!\" He closed his eyes\nsleepily and resumed his dreams.\n\nWalking around the lizard, they resumed their journey and soon came to\nthe frog, being guided by its grunts and croaks. Then off it went\nagain, its tremendous leap carrying it far into the fog. Suddenly,\nCap'n Bill tripped and would have fallen flat had not Trot and\nButton-Bright held him up. Then he saw that he had stumbled over the\nclaw of a gigantic land-crab, which lay sprawled out upon the pebbly\nbottom.\n\n\"Oh, beg parding, I'm sure!\" exclaimed Cap'n Bill, backing away.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" replied the crab in a tired tone. \"You did not\ndisturb me, so there is no harm done.\"\n\n\"We didn't know you were here,\" explained Trot.\n\n\"Probably not,\" said the crab. \"It's no place for me, anyhow, for I\nbelong in the Constellations, you know, with Taurus and Gemini and the\nother fellows. But I had the misfortune to tumble out of the Zodiac\nsome time ago. My name is Cancer, but I'm not a disease. Those who\nexamine the heavens in these days, alas! can find no Cancer there.\"\n\n\"Yes we can, sir, Mister Cancer!\" said the parrot with a chuckle.\n\n\"Once,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"I sawr a picter of you in an almanac.\"\n\n\"Ah, the almanacs always did us full justice,\" the crab replied, \"but\nI'm told they're not fashionable now.\"\n\n\"If you don't mind, we'd like to pass on,\" said Button-Bright.\n\n\"No, I don't mind, but be careful not to step on my legs. They're\nrheumatic, it's so moist here.\"\n\nThey climbed over some of the huge legs and walked around others. Soon\nthey had left the creature far behind. \"Aren't you rather slow?\" asked\nthe frog when once more they came up to him.\n\n\"It isn't that,\" said Trot. \"You are rather swift, I guess.\" The frog\nchuckled and leaped again. They noticed that the fog had caught a soft\nrose tint and was lighter and less dense than before, for which reason\nthe sailor remarked that they must be getting near to the Pink Country.\n\nOn this jump they saw nothing but a monstrous turtle, which lay asleep\nwith its head and legs drawn into its shell. It was not in their way,\nso they hurried on and rejoined the frog, which said to them, \"I'm\nsorry, but I'm due at the King's Court in a few minutes, and I can't\nwait for your short, weak legs to make the journey to the Pink Country.\nBut if you will climb upon my back, I think I can carry you to the\nborder in one more leap.\"\n\n\"I'm tired,\" said Trot, \"an' this awful fog's beginnin' to choke me.\nLet's ride on the frog, Cap'n.\"\n\n\"Right you are, mate,\" he replied, and although he shook a bit with\nfear, the old man at once began to climb to the frog's back. Trot\nseated herself on one side of him and Button-bright on the other, and\nthe sailor put his arms around them both to hold them tight together.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" asked the frog.\n\n\"Ding-dong!\" cried the parrot.\n\n  \"All aboard, let 'er go!\n  Jump the best jump that you know.\"\n\n\"Don't--don't! Jump sort o' easy, please,\" begged Cap'n Bill.\n\nBut the frog was unable to obey his request. Its powerful hind legs\nstraightened like steel springs and shot the big body, with its\npassengers, through the fog like an arrow launched from a bow. They\ngasped for breath and tried to hang on, and then suddenly the frog\nlanded just at the edge of the Fog Bank, stopping so abruptly that his\nthree riders left his back and shot far ahead of him. They felt the fog\nmelt away and found themselves bathed in glorious rays of sunshine, but\nthey had no time to consider this change because they were still\nshooting through the air, and presently--before they could think of\nanything at all--all three were rolling heels over head on the soft\ngrass of a meadow.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PINK COUNTRY\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\nWhen the travelers could collect their senses and sit up, they stared\nabout them in bewilderment, for the transition from the sticky, damp\nfog to this brilliant scene was so abrupt as to daze them at first.\n\nIt was a Pink Country indeed. The grass was a soft pink, the trees were\npink, all the fences and buildings which they saw in the near distance\nwere pink--even the gravel in the pretty paths was pink. Many shades of\ncolor were there, of course, grading from a faint blush rose to deep\npink verging on red, but no other color was visible. In the sky hung a\npink glow, with rosy clouds floating here and there, and the sun was\nnot silvery white, as we see it from the Earth, but a distinct pink.\n\nThe sun was high in the sky just now, which proved the adventurers had\nbeen a long time in passing through the Fog Bank. But all of them were\nwonderfully relieved to reach this beautiful country in safety, for\naside from the danger that threatened them in the Blue Country, the\nother side of the island was very depressing. Here the scene that\nconfronted them was pretty and homelike, except for the prevailing\ncolor and the fact that all the buildings were round, without a single\ncorner or angle.\n\nHalf a mile distant was a large City, its pink tintings glistening\nbravely in the pink sunshine, while hundreds of pink banners floated\nfrom its numerous domes. The country between the Fog Bank and the city\nwas like a vast garden, very carefully kept and as neat as wax.\n\nThe parrot was fluttering its wings and pruning its feathers to remove\nthe wet of the fog. Trot and Button-Bright and Cap'n Bill were all\nsoaked to the skin and chilled through, but as they sat upon the pink\ngrass they felt the rays of the sun sending them warmth and rapidly\ndrying their clothes; so, being tired out, they laid themselves\ncomfortably down and first one and then another fell cozily asleep.\n\nIt was the parrot that aroused them.\n\n  \"Look out--look out--\n  There's folks about!\"\n\nit screamed.\n\n\"The apple-dumplings, fat and pink, Will be here quicker than a wink!\"\n\nTrot stared up in alarm and rubbed her eyes; Cap'n Bill rolled over and\nblinked, hardly remembering where he was; Button-Bright was on his feet\nin an instant. Advancing toward them were four of the natives of the\nPink Country.\n\nTwo were men and two were women, and their appearance was in sharp\ncontrast to that of the Blueskins. For the Pinkies were round and\nchubby--almost like \"apple-dumplings,\" as the parrot called them--and\nthey were not very tall, the highest of the men being no taller than\nTrot or Button-Bright. They all had short necks and legs, pink hair and\neyes, rosy cheeks and pink complexions, and their faces were\ngood-natured and jolly in expression.\n\nThe men wore picturesque pink clothing and round hats with pink\nfeathers in them, but the apparel of the women was still more gorgeous\nand striking. Their dresses consisted of layer after layer of gauzy\ntuck and ruffles and laces, caught here and there with bows of dainty\nribbon. The skirts--which of course were of many shades of pink--were\nso fluffy and light that they stuck out from the fat bodies of the\nPinkie women like the skirts of ballet-dancers, displaying their chubby\npink ankles and pink kid shoes. They wore rings and necklaces and\nbracelets and brooches of rose-gold set with pink gems, and all four of\nthe new arrivals, both men and women, carried sharp-pointed sticks made\nof rosewood for weapons.\n\nThey halted a little way from our adventurers, and one of the women\nmuttered in a horrified voice, \"Blueskins!\"\n\n  \"Guess again! The more you guess\n  I rather think you'll know the less,\"\n\nretorted the parrot, and then he added grumblingly in Trot's ear, \"Blue\nfeathers don't make bluebirds.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said the girl, standing up and bowing respectfully to the\nPinkies, \"we are not Blueskins, although we are wearing the blue\nuniforms of the Boolooroo and have just escaped from the Blue Country.\nIf you will look closely, you will see that our skins are white.\"\n\n\"There is some truth in what she says,\" remarked one of the men\nthoughtfully. \"Their skins are not blue, but neither are they white. To\nbe exact, I should call the skin of the girl and that of the boy a\nmuddy pink, rather faded, while the skin of the gigantic monster with\nthem is an unpleasant brown.\"\n\nCap'n Bill looked cross for a minute, for he did not like to be called\na \"gigantic monster,\" although he realized he was much larger than the\npink people.\n\n\"What country did you come from\" asked the woman who had first spoken.\n\n\"From the Earth,\" replied Button-Bright.\n\n\"The Earth! The Earth!\" they repeated. \"That is a country we have never\nheard of. Where is it located?\"\n\n\"Why, down below somewhere,\" said the boy, who did now know in which\ndirection the Earth lay. \"It isn't just one country, but a good many\ncountries.\"\n\n\"We have three countries in Sky Island,\" returned the woman. \"They are\nthe Blue Country, the Fog Country and the Pink Country. But of course\nthis end of the Island is the most important.\"\n\n\"How came you in the Blue Country, from whence you say you escaped?\"\nasked the man.\n\n\"We flew there by means of a Magic Umbrella,\" explained Button-Bright,\n\"but the wicked Boolooroo stole it from us.\"\n\n\"Stole it! How dreadful,\" they all cried in a chorus.\n\n\"And they made us slaves,\" said Trot.\n\n\"An' wanted fer to patch us,\" added Cap'n Bill indignantly.\n\n\"So we ran away and passed through the Fog Bank and came here,\" said\nButton-Bright.\n\nThe Pinkies turned away and conversed together in low tones. Then one\nof the women came forward and addressed the strangers. \"Your story is\nthe strangest we have ever heard,\" said she, \"and your presence here is\nstill more strange and astonishing. So we have decided to take you to\nTourmaline and let her decide what shall be your fate.\"\n\n\"Who is Tourmaline?\" inquired Trot doubtfully, for she didn't like the\nidea of being \"taken\" to anyone.\n\n\"The Queen of the Pinkies. She is the sole Ruler of our country, so the\nword of Tourmaline is the Law of the Land.\"\n\n\"Seems to me we've had 'bout enough of kings an' queens,\" remarked\nCap'n Bill. \"Can't we shy your Tut-Tor-mar-line--or whatever you call\nher--in some way an' deal with you direct?\"\n\n\"No. Until we prove your truth and honor we must regard you as enemies\nof our race. If you had a Magic Umbrella, you may be magicians and\nsorcerers come here to deceive us and perhaps betray us to our natural\nenemies, the Blueskins.\"\n\n  \"Mud and bricks, fiddlesticks!\n  We don't play such nasty tricks,\"\n\nyelled the parrot angrily, and this caused the Pinkies to shrink back\nin alarm, for they had never seen a parrot before.\n\n\"Surely this is magic!\" declared one of the men. \"No bird can talk\nunless inspired by witchcraft.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, parrots can,\" said Trot. But this incident had determined the\nPinkies to consider our friends prisoners and to take them immediately\nbefore their Queen.\n\n\"Must we fight you?\" asked the woman. \"Or will you come with us\npeaceably?\"\n\n\"We'll go peaceable,\" answered Cap'n Bill. \"You're a-makin' a sad\nmistake, for we're as harmless as doves; but seein' as you're\nsuspicious, we'd better have it out with your Queen first as last.\"\n\nTheir clothing was quite dry by this time, although much wrinkled and\ndiscolored by the penetrating fog, so at once they prepared to follow\nthe Pinkies. The two men walked on either side of them, holding the\npointed sticks ready to jab them if they attempted to escape, and the\ntwo women followed in the rear, also armed with sharp sticks.\n\nSo the procession moved along the pretty roadways to the City, which\nthey soon reached. There was a strong, high wall of pink marble around\nit, and they passed through a gate made of pink metal bars and found\nthemselves in a most delightful and picturesque town. The houses were\nbig and substantial, all round in shape, with domed roofs and circular\nwindows and doorways. In all the place there was but one street--a\ncircular one that started at the gate and wound like a corkscrew toward\nthe center of the City. It was paved with pink marble, and between the\nstreet and the houses that lined both sides of it were gardens filled\nwith pink flowers and pink grass lawns, which were shaded by pink trees\nand shrubbery.\n\nAs the Queen lived in the very center of the city, the captives were\nobliged to parade the entire length of this street, and that gave all\nthe Pink Citizens a chance to have a good look at the strangers. The\nPinkies were every one short and fat and gorgeously dressed in pink\nattire, and their faces indicated that they were contented and happy.\nThey were much surprised at Cap'n Bill's great size and wooden leg--two\nvery unusual things in their experience--and the old sailor frightened\nmore than one Pink boy and girl and sent them scampering into the\nhouses, where they viewed the passing procession from behind the window\nshutters in comparative safety. As for the grown people, many of them\ngot out their sharp-pointed sticks to use as weapons in case the\nstrangers attacked them or broke away from their guards. A few, more\nbold than the others, followed on at the tail of the procession, and so\npresently they all reached an open, circular place in the exact center\nof the Pink City.\n\n\n\n\nTOURMALINE THE POVERTY QUEEN\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\nThe open space which they entered was paved with pink marble, and\naround it were two rows of large, pink statues, at least life-size and\nbeautifully sculptured. All were set upon nicely carved pink pedestals.\nThey were, of course, statues of Pinky men and women, and all had bands\nof pink metal around their foreheads, in the center of each band being\na glistening pink jewel.\n\nAbout the middle of the open space inside the statues, which appeared\nto be the public meeting place of the Pinkies, was a small, low house,\ndomed like all the other houses but built of a coarse pink stone\ninstead of the fine marble to be seen everywhere else. It had no\nornamentation, being exceedingly plain in appearance. No banners\nfloated from it; no flowers grew near it.\n\n\"Here,\" said one of their guides as the procession halted before the\nlittle stone building, \"is the palace of Tourmaline, who is our Queen.\"\n\n\"What, that little cabin?\" exclaimed Trot.\n\n\"Of course. Did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome\nresidences?\" asked the woman, evidently surprised.\n\n\"I thought it would be better,\" said the girl. \"All the palaces I've\nseen were splendid.\"\n\n\"A splendid palace!\" exclaimed one of the Pinkies, and then they looked\nat one another in amazement and seemed to doubt that their ears had\nheard aright.\n\n\"These intruders are very peculiar people,\" remarked a man in the crowd.\n\n\"They seem very ignorant, poor things!\" said another in reply.\n\n\"Come!\" commanded the woman who led the party. \"You three must follow\nme to the presence of Tourmaline. The people must wait outside, for\nthere is no room for them in the palace.\"\n\nSo they followed her through the low archway, and in a room beyond,\nvery simply furnished, sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of\npink stockings. She was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of\nage, not fat like all the rest of the Pinkies but slender and well\nformed according to our own ideas of beauty. Her complexion was not a\ndecided pink, but a soft, rosy tint not much deeper than that of Trot's\nskin. Instead of a silken gown furbelowed like all the others they had\nseen women wear in this land, Tourmaline was dressed in a severely\nplain robe of coarse pink cloth much resembling bedticking. Across her\nbrow, however, was a band of rose gold, in the center of which was set\na luminous pink jewel which gleamed more brilliantly than a diamond. It\nwas her badge of office and seemed very incongruous when compared with\nher poor rainment and simple surroundings.\n\nAs they entered, the girl sighed and laid down her work. Her expression\nwas patient and resigned as she faced her audience. \"What is it,\nCoralie?\" she asked the woman.\n\n\"Here are three strange people, Tourmaline,\" was the reply, \"who say\nthey have entered our country through the Fog Bank. They tell a queer\nstory of an escape from the Blueskins, so I decided to bring them to\nyou, that you may determine their fate.\"\n\nThe Queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest. She smiled--a\nlittle sadly--at Trot, seemed to approve Button-Bright's open, frank\nface, and was quite surprised because Cap'n Bill was so much bigger\nthan her own people. \"Are you a giant?\" she asked the sailor in a soft,\nsweet voice.\n\n\"No, your Majesty,\" he replied, \"I'm only--\"\n\n\"Majesty!\" she exclaimed, flushing a deeper pink. \"Are you addressing\nthat word to me?\"\n\n\"O' course, ma'am,\" answered Cap'n Bill. \"I'm told that's the proper\nway to speak to a Queen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are trying to ridicule me,\" she continued, regarding the\nsailor's face closely. \"There is nothing majestic about me, as you know\nvery well. Coralie, do you consider 'majesty' a proper word to use when\naddressing a Queen?\" she added, appealing to the Pinky woman.\n\n\"By no means,\" was the prompt reply.\n\n\"What shall I call her, then?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Just Tourmaline. That is her name, and it is sufficient,\" said the\nwoman.\n\n\"The Ruler of a country ought to be treated with great respec',\"\ndeclared Trot a little indignantly, for she thought the pretty little\nqueen was not being properly deferred to.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Tourmaline curiously.\n\n\"Because the Ruler is the mos' 'risticratic person in any land,\"\nexplained the little girl. \"Even in America ever'body bows low to our\nPresident, an' the Blueskins are so 'fraid o' their Boolooroo that they\ntremble whenever they go near him.\"\n\n\"But surely that is all wrong,\" said Tourmaline gravely. \"The Ruler is\nappointed to protect and serve the people, and here in the Pink Country\nI have the full power to carry out the laws. I even decree death when\nsuch a punishment is merited. Therefore I am a mere agent to direct the\nlaws, which are the Will of the People, and am only a public servant\nobliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Button-Bright, \"you're entitled to the best there\nis to pay for your trouble. A powerful ruler ought to be rich and to\nlive in a splendid palace. Your folks ought to treat you with great\nrespect, as Trot says.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" responded Tourmaline quickly. \"That would indeed be very\nwrong. Too much should never be given to anyone. If, with my great\npower, conferred upon me by the people, I also possessed great wealth,\nI might be tempted to be cruel and overbearing. In that case my\nsubjects would justly grow envious of my superior station. If I lived\nas luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns, the\ngood Pinkies would say that their Queen had more than they themselves,\nand it would be true. No, our way is best. The Ruler, be it king or\nqueen, has absolute power to rule, but no riches, no high station, no\nfalse adulation. The people have the wealth and honor, for it is their\ndue. The Queen has nothing but the power to execute the laws, to adjust\ngrievances and to compel order.\"\n\n\"What pays you, then, for all your bother?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"I have one great privilege. After my death a pink marble statue of me\nwill be set up in the Grand Court, with the statues of the other Kings\nand Queens who have ruled this land, and all the Pinkies in ages to\ncome will then honor me as having been a just and upright queen. That\nis my reward.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for you, ma'am,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"Your pay for bein' a\nqueen is sort o' like a life-insurance. If don't come due till after\nyou're dead, an' then you can't get much fun out o' it.\"\n\n\"I did not choose to be the Queen,\" answered Tourmaline simply. \"A\nmisfortune of birth placed me here, and I cannot escape my fate. It is\nmuch more desirable to be a private citizen, happy and carefree. But we\nhave talked long enough of myself. Tell me who you are, and why you\nhave come here.\"\n\nBetween them they told the story of how the Magic Umbrella had taken\nthem to Sky Island, which they did not know when they started was\nanywhere in existence. Button-Bright told this, and then Trot related\ntheir adventures among the Blueskins and how the Boolooroo had stolen\nthe umbrella and prevented them from going home again. The parrot on\nher shoulder kept interrupting her continually, for the mention of the\nBoolooroo seemed to make the bird frantic with rage.\n\n  \"Naughty, naughty Boolooroo!\n  He's the worst I ever knew!\"\n\nthe parrot repeated over and over again.\n\nCap'n Bill finished the story by telling of their escape through the\nFog Bank. \"We didn't know what your Pink Country was like, o' course,\"\nhe said, \"but we knew it couldn't be worse than the Blue Country, an'\nwe didn't take any stock in their stories that the Fog Bank would be\nthe death o' us.\"\n\n  \"Pretty wet! Pretty wet\n  Was the journey, you can bet!\"\n\ndeclared the parrot in conclusion.\n\n\"Yes, it was wet an' sticky, all right,\" agreed the sailor, \"but the\nbig frog helped us an' we got through all right.\"\n\n\"But what can you do here?\" asked Tourmaline. \"You are not like my\npeople, the Pinkies, and there is no place for you in our country.\"\n\n\"That's true enough,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"but we had to go somewhere, an'\nthis was the likeliest place we could think of. Your Sky Island ain't\nvery big, so when we couldn't stay in the Blue Country, where ever'body\nhated us, or in the Fog Bank, which ain't healthy an' is too wet for\nhumans to live in for long, we nat'rally were forced to enter the Pink\nCountry, where we expected to find nice people.\"\n\n\"We ARE nice,\" said Tourmaline, \"but it is our country, not yours, and\nwe have no place here for strangers. In all our history you are the\nfirst people from outside our borders who have ever stepped a foot in\nour land. We do not hate you, as you say the Blueskins do, nor are we\nsavage or cruel, but we do not want you here, and I am really puzzled\nwhat to do with you.\"\n\n\"Isn't there a law to cover this case?\" asked Coralie.\n\n\"I do not remember any such law,\" replied the queen, \"but I will search\nin the Great Book and see if I can find anything that refers to strange\npeople entering our land.\"\n\n\"If not,\" said the woman, \"you must make a law. It is your duty.\"\n\n\"I know,\" answered Tourmaline, \"but I hope such a responsibility will\nnot fall upon my shoulders. These poor strangers are in a very\nuncomfortable position, and I wish I could help them to get back to\ntheir own country.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Trot. \"We wish so, too. Haven't you any fairies here?\"\n\n\"Oh, there are fairies, of course, as there are everywhere,\" answered\nTourmaline, \"but none that we can call to our assistance or command to\ndo our bidding.\"\n\n\"How about witches?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"I know of one witch,\" said Tourmaline thoughtfully, \"but she is not\nvery obliging. She says it makes her head ache to perform witchcraft,\nand so she seldom indulges in it. But if there is no other way, I may\nbe obliged to call upon Rosalie for help. I'll look in the Great Book\nfirst. Meantime, you will go home with Coralie, who will feed you and\ngive you entertainment. Tomorrow morning come to me again and then I\nwill decree your fate.\" The little queen then picked up her stocking\nand began to darn the holes in it, and Coralie, without any formal\nparting, led the strangers from the miserable palace.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SUNRISE TRIBE AND THE SUNSET TRIBE\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nAlthough Trot and her comrades were still prisoners, they were far more\ncomfortable than they had been in the Blue Country. Coralie took them\nto her own home, where she lived in great luxury, being one of the\nprominent women of the Pinkies. In this country the women seemed fully\nas important as the men, and instead of being coddled and petted, they\nperformed their share of the work, both in public and private affairs,\nand were expected to fight in the wars exactly as the men did.\n\nOur friends learned considerable about the Pinkies during that\nafternoon and evening, for their hostess proved kind and agreeable and\nfrankly answered all their questions. Although this half of Sky Island\nwas no larger than the Blue Country, being no more than two miles\nsquare, it had several hundred inhabitants. These were divided into two\ntribes, which were called the Sunrise Tribe and the Sunset Tribe. The\nSunrise Tribe lived in the eastern half of the Pink Country and the\nSunset Tribe in the west half, and there was great rivalry between\nthem, and sometimes war.\n\nIt was all a question of social importance. The Sunrise Tribe claimed\nthat every day the sun greeted them first of all, which proved they\nwere the most important; but on the other hand, the Sunset Tribe\nclaimed that the sun always deserted the other tribe and came to them,\nwhich was evidence that they were the most attractive people. On Sky\nIsland--at least on the Pink side--the sun arose in wonderful splendor,\nbut also it set in a blaze of glory, and so there were arguments on\nboth sides, and for want of something better to argue about, the\nPinkies took this queer subject as a cause of dispute.\n\nBoth Tribes acknowledged Tourmaline their Queen and obeyed the laws of\nthe country, and just at this time there was peace in the land, and all\nthe inhabitants of the east and west were friendly. But they had been\nknown, Coralie said, to fight one another fiercely with their sharp\nsticks, at which times a good many were sure to get hurt.\n\n\"Why do they call this an Island?\" asked Button-Bright. \"There isn't\nany water around it, is there?\"\n\n\"No, but there is sky all around it,\" answered Coralie. \"And if one\nshould step off the edge, he would go tumbling into the great sky and\nnever be heard of again.\"\n\n\"Is there a fence around the edge?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Only a few places are fenced,\" was the reply. \"Usually there are rows\nof thick bushes set close to the edge to prevent people from falling\noff. Once there was a King of the Pinkies who was cruel and overbearing\nand imagined he was superior to the people he ruled, so one day his\nsubjects carried him to the edge of the island and threw him over the\nbushes.\"\n\n\"Goodness me!\" said Trot. \"He might have hit someone on the Earth.\"\n\n\"Guess he skipped it, though,\" added Cap'n Bill, \"for I never heard of\na Pinky till I came here.\"\n\n\"And I have never heard of the Earth,\" retorted Coralie. \"Of course,\nthere must be such a place, because you came from there, but the Earth\nis never visible in our sky.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Button-Bright, \"'cause it's UNDER your island. But it's\nthere, all right, and it's a pretty good place to live. I wish I could\nget back to it.\"\n\n\"So do I, Button-Bright!\" exclaimed Trot.\n\n\"Let's fly!\" cried the parrot, turning his head so that one bright\nlittle eye looked directly into the girl's eye. \"Say goodbye and let's\nfly through the sky, far and high!\"\n\n\"If we only had my umbrella, we'd fly in a minute,\" sighed\nButton-Bright. \"But the Boolooroo stole it.\"\n\n  \"Naughty, naughty Boolooroo,\n  What a wicked thing to do!\"\n\nwailed the parrot, and they all agreed with him.\n\nCoralie belonged to the Sunset Tribe, as she lived west of the queen's\npalace, which was the center of the Pink Country. A servant came to the\nroom where they were conversing to state that the sun was about to set,\nand at once Coralie arose and took the strangers to an upper balcony,\nwhere all the household had assembled.\n\nThe neighboring houses also had their balconies and roofs filled with\npeople, for it seemed all the Sunset Tribe came out every night to\nwitness the setting of the sun. It was really a magnificent sight, and\nTrot scarcely breathed as the great, golden ball sank low in the sky\nand colored all the clouds with gorgeous tints of orange, red and\nyellow. Never on the Earth was there visible such splendor, and as the\nlittle girl watched the ever-changing scene, she decided the Sunset\nTribe was amply justified in claiming that the West was the favored\ncountry of the sun.\n\n\"You see,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"the sky is all around us, an' we're high\nup, so the sun really loses itself in the clouds an' leaves a trail of\nbeauty behind him.\"\n\n\"He does that!\" agreed Trot. \"This is almost worth comin' for, Cap'n.\"\n\n\"But not quite,\" said Button-bright sadly. \"I'd get along without the\nsunset if only we could go home.\"\n\nThey went in to dinner after this, and sat at Coralie's own table with\nher husband and children and found the meal very good. After a pleasant\nevening, during which no reference was made to their being prisoners,\nthey were shown to prettily furnished rooms--all in pink--and slept\nsoundly in the soft beds provided for them. Trot wakened early the next\nmorning and went out on the balcony to see the sunrise. The little girl\nwas well repaid, for the splendor of the rising sun was almost equal to\nthat of the setting sun. Surely this was a wonderful country and much\nmore delightful than the Blue side of the island, where the sun was\nhidden by the great Fog and only the moon was visible.\n\nWhen she went in, she found that both Button-Bright and Cap'n Bill were\nup and dressed, so they decided to take a walk before breakfast. No one\nrestrained them or interfered with them in any way. \"They know we can't\nget away,\" observed the sailor, \"so they don't need to watch us.\"\n\n\"We could go into the Fog Bank again,\" suggested Trot.\n\n\"We could, mate, but we won't,\" answered Cap'n Bill. \"If there's no way\nfor us to get clean off'n Sky Island, I'd rather stay with the Pinkies\nthan with the Blues.\"\n\n\"I wonder what they'll do with us,\" said Button-Bright. \"The Queen\nseems like a nice girl, and I don't think she'll hurt us, whatever\nhappens.\"\n\nThey walked freely along the circular street, seeing such sights as the\nPink City afforded, and then returned to Coralie's house for breakfast.\nCoralie herself was not there, as she had been summoned to the Queen's\npalace, but her husband looked after the guests, and when breakfast was\nfinished he said to them, \"I am to take you to Tourmaline, who has\npromised to decide your fate this morning. I am curious to know what\nshe will do with you, for in all our history we have never before had\nstrangers intrude upon us.\"\n\n\"We're curious, too,\" said Trot, \"but we'll soon find out.\" As they\nwalked down the street, they observed that the sky was now covered with\ndark clouds which entirely hid the sun.\n\n\"Does it ever rain here?\" inquired Button-Bright.\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Coralie's husband, \"that is the one drawback of\nour country: it rains quite often. And although it makes the flowers\nand the grass grow, I think rain is very disagreeable. I am always glad\nto see the rainbow, which is a sign that the sun will shine again.\"\n\n\"Looks like rain now,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"It does,\" said the man, glancing at the sky. \"We must hurry, or we may\nget wet.\"\n\n\"Haven't you any umbrellas?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"No, we don't know what umbrellas are,\" replied the Pinky man.\n\nIt did not rain at once, and they reached Tourmaline's wretched hut in\nsafety. There they found quite a number of Pinkies assembled, and a\nspirited discussion was taking place when they arrived.\n\n\"Come in, please,\" said Tourmaline, opening the door for them, and when\nthey had entered, she placed a pinkwood bench for them to sit upon and\nwent back to her throne, which was a common rocking chair. At her right\nwere seated six men and women of the Sunrise Tribe, and on her left six\nmen and women of the Sunset Tribe, among the latter being Coralie. The\ncontrast between the plain, simple dress of the Queen and the gorgeous\napparel of her Counselors was quite remarkable, yet her beauty far\nsurpassed that of any of her people, and her demeanor was so modest and\nunassuming that it was difficult for the prisoners to believe that her\nword would decree life or death and that all the others were\nsubservient to her. Tourmaline's eyes were so deep a shade of pink that\nthey were almost hazel, and her hair was darker than that of the\nothers, being a golden-red in color. These points, taken with her\nlight-pink skin and slender form, rendered her distinctive among the\nPinkies, whatever gown she might wear.\n\nWhen the strangers were seated, she turned to them and said, \"I have\nsearched through the Great Book of Laws and found nothing about foreign\npeople entering our land. There is a law that if any of the Blueskins\nbreak through the Fog Bank, they shall be driven back with sharp\nsticks; but you are not Blueskins, so this Law does not apply to you.\nTherefore, in order to decide your fate, I have summoned a Council of\ntwelve of my people, who will vote as to whether you shall be permitted\nto remain here or not. They wanted to see you before they cast their\nfinal vote, that they may examine you carefully and discover if you are\nworthy to become inhabitants of the Pink Country.\"\n\n  \"The rose is red, the violet's blue,\n  But Trot is sweeter than the two!\"\n\ndeclared the parrot in a loud voice. It was a little verse Cap'n Bill\nhad taught the bird that very morning while Trot was seeing the sun\nrise.\n\nThe Pinkies were startled and seemed a little frightened at hearing a\nbird speak so clearly. Trot laughed and patted the bird's head in\nreturn for the compliment. \"Is the Monster Man whose legs are part wood\na dangerous creature?\" asked one of the Sunrise Tribe.\n\n\"Not to my friends,\" replied Cap'n Bill, much amused. \"I s'pose I could\nfight your whole crowd of Pinkies if I had to, an' make you run for\nyour lives, but bein' as you're friendly to us, you ain't in any\ndanger.\" The sailor thought this speech was diplomatic and might \"head\noff any trouble,\" but the Pinkies seemed uneasy, and several of them\npicked up their slender, pointed sticks and held them in their hands.\nThey were not cowardly, but it was evident they mistrusted the big man,\nwho on Earth was not considered big at all, but rather undersized.\n\n\"What we'd like,\" said Trot, \"is to stay here, cozy an' peaceable, till\nwe can find a way to get home to the Earth again. Your country is much\nnicer than the Blue Country, and we like you pretty well from what\nwe've seen of you, so if you'll let us stay, we won't be any more\ntrouble to you than we can help.\"\n\nThey all gazed upon the little girl curiously, and one of them said,\n\"How strangely light her color is! And it is pink, too, which is in her\nfavor. But her eyes are of that dreadful blue tint which prevails in\nthe other half of Sky Island, while her hair is a queer color unknown\nto us. She is not like our people and would not harmonize with the\nuniversal color here.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said another. \"The three strangers are all inharmonious.\nIf allowed to remain here, they would ruin the color scheme of the\ncountry, where all is now pink.\"\n\n\"In spite of that,\" said Coralie, \"they are harmless creatures and have\ndone us no wrong.\"\n\n\"Yes they have,\" replied a nervous little Sunrise man, \"they wronged us\nby coming here.\"\n\n\"They could not help doing that,\" argued Coralie, \"and it is their\nmisfortune that they are here on Sky Island at all. Perhaps if we keep\nthem with us for a while, they may find a way to return safely to their\nown country.\"\n\n\"We'll fly through the sky by-and-by--ki-yi!\" yelled the parrot with\nstartling suddenness.\n\n\"Is that true?\" asked a Pinky seriously.\n\n\"Why, we would if we could,\" answered Trot. \"We flew to this island,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said another, \"if we pushed them off the edge, they could\nfly down again. Who knows?\"\n\n\"We know,\" answered Cap'n Bill hastily. \"We'd tumble, but we wouldn't\nfly.\"\n\n  \"They'd take a fall--\n  And that is all!\"\n\nobserved the parrot, fluttering its wings. There was silence for a\nmoment while all the Pinkies seemed to think deeply. Then the Queen\nasked the strangers to step outside while they counseled together. Our\nfriends obeyed, and leaving the room they all entered the courtyard and\nexamined the rows of pink marble statues for nearly an hour before they\nwere summoned to return to the little room in Tourmaline's palace.\n\n\"We are now ready to vote as to your fate,\" said the pretty Queen to\nthem. \"We have decided there are but two things for us do to: either\npermit you to remain here as honored guests or take you to an edge of\nthe island and throw you over the bushes into the sky.\"\n\nThey were silent at hearing this dreadful alternative, but the parrot\nscreamed shrilly,\n\n  \"Oh, what a dump! Oh, what a jump!\n  Won't we all thump when we land with a bump?\"\n\n\"If we do,\" said Cap'n Bill thoughtfully, \"we'll none of us know it.\"\n\n\n\n\nROSALIE THE WITCH\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nTrot and Button-Bright had now become worried and anxious, for they\nknew if they were tossed over the edge of the island they would be\nkilled. Cap'n Bill frowned and set his jaws tight together. The old\nsailor had made up his mind to make a good fight for his boy and girl,\nas well as for his own life, if he was obliged to do so.\n\nThe twelve Counselors then voted, and when the vote was counted,\nTourmaline announced that six had voted to allow the strangers to\nremain and six to toss them over the bushes. \"We seem evenly divided on\nthis matter,\" remarked the Queen with a puzzled look at her Council.\n\nTrot thought the pretty Queen was their friend, so she said, \"Of course\nyou'll have the deciding vote, then, you being the Ruler.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" replied Tourmaline. \"Since I have asked these good people to\nadvise me, it would be impolite to side against some of them and with\nthe others. That would imply that the judgment of some of my Counselors\nis wrong, and the judgment of others right. I must ask someone else to\ncast the deciding vote.\"\n\n\"Who will it be, then?\" inquired Trot. \"Can't I do it? Or Cap'n Bill or\nButton-Bright?\"\n\nTourmaline smiled and shook her head, while all the Counselors murmured\ntheir protests.\n\n  \"Let Trot do it\n  Or you'll rue it!\"\n\nadvised the parrot, and then he barked like a dog and made them all\njump.\n\n\"Let me think a moment,\" said the Queen, resting her chin on her hand.\n\n  \"A Pink can think\n  As quick's a wink!\"\n\nthe parrot declared. But Tourmaline's thoughts required time, and all\nher Counselors remained silent and watched her anxiously.\n\nAt last she raised her head and said, \"I shall call upon Rosalie the\nWitch. She is wise and honest and will decide the matter justly.\"\n\nThe Pinkies seemed to approve this choice, so Tourmaline rose and took\na small, pink paper parcel from a drawer. In it was a pink powder,\nwhich she scattered upon the seat of a big armchair. Then she lighted\nthis powder, which at first flashed vivid pink and then filled all the\nspace around the chair with a thick, pink cloud of smoke. Presently the\nsmoke cleared away, when they all saw seated within the chair Rosalie\nthe Witch.\n\nThis famous woman was much like the other Pinkies in appearance except\nthat she was somewhat taller and not quite so fat as most of the\npeople. Her skin and hair and eyes were all of a rosy, pink color, and\nher gown was of spiderweb gauze that nicely matched her complexion. She\ndid not seem very old, for her features were smiling and attractive and\npleasant to view. She held in her hand a slender staff tipped with a\nlustrous pink jewel.\n\nAll the Pinkies present bowed very respectfully to Rosalie, who\nreturned the salutation with a dignified nod. Then Tourmaline began to\nexplain the presence of the three strangers and the difficulty of\ndeciding what to do with them.\n\n\"I have summoned you here that you may cast the deciding vote,\" added\nthe Queen. \"What shall we do, Rosalie, allow them to remain here as\nhonored guests, or toss them over the bushes into the sky?\"\n\nRosalie, during Tourmaline's speech, had been attentively examining the\nfaces of the three Earth people. Now she said,\n\n\"Before I decide, I must see who these strangers are. I will follow\ntheir adventures in a vision to discover if they have told you the\ntruth. And in order that you may all share my knowledge, you shall see\nthe vision as I see it.\" She then bowed her head and closed her eyes.\n\n  \"Rock-a-bye, baby, on a treetop;\n  Don't wake her up, or the vision will stop,\"\n\nmuttered the parrot, but no one paid any attention to the noisy bird.\n\nGradually, a pink mist formed in the air about the Witch, and in this\nmist the vision began to appear.\n\nFirst, there was Button-bright in the attic of his house, finding the\nMagic Umbrella. Then his first flight was shown, and afterward his trip\nacross the United States until he landed on the bluff where Trot sat.\nIn rapid succession the scenes shifted and disclosed the trial flights,\nwith Trot and Cap'n Bill as passengers, then the trip to Sky Island and\nthe meeting with the Boolooroo. No sound was heard, but it was easy\nfrom the gestures of the actors for the Pinkies to follow all the\nadventures of the strangers in the Blue Country. Button-Bright was\ngreatly astonished to see in this vision how the Boolooroo had tested\nthe Magic Umbrella and in a fit of rage cast it into a corner\nunderneath the cabinet, with the seats and lunch basket still attached\nto the handle by means of the rope. The boy now knew why he could not\nfind the umbrella in the Treasure Chamber, and he was provoked to think\nhe had several times been quite close to it without knowing it was\nthere. The last scene ended with the trip through the Fog Bank and the\nassistance rendered them by the friendly frog. After the three tumbled\nupon the grass of the Pink Country, the vision faded away, and Rosalie\nlifted her head with a smile of triumph at the success of her\nwitchcraft.\n\n\"Did you see clearly?\" she asked.\n\n\"We did, O Wonderful Witch!\" they declared.\n\n\"Then,\" said Rosalie, \"there can be no doubt in your minds that these\nstrangers have told you the truth.\"\n\n\"None at all,\" they admitted.\n\n\"What arguments are advanced by the six Counselors who voted to allow\nthem to remain here as guests?\" inquired the Witch.\n\n\"They have done us no harm,\" answered Coralie, speaking for her side,\n\"therefore we should, in honor and justice, do them no harm.\"\n\nRosalie nodded. \"What arguments have the others advanced?\" she asked.\n\n\"They interfere with our color scheme and do not harmonize with our\npeople,\" a man of the Sunrise Tribe answered.\n\nAgain Rosalie nodded, and Trot thought her eyes twinkled a little.\n\n\"I think I now fully comprehend the matter,\" said she, \"and so I will\ncast my vote. I favor taking the Earth people to the edge of the island\nand casting them into the sky.\"\n\nFor a moment there was perfect silence in the room. All present\nrealized that this was a decree of death to the strangers. Trot was\ngreatly surprised at the decision, and for a moment she thought her\nheart had stopped beating, for a wave of fear swept over her.\nButton-Bright flushed red as a Pinky and then grew very pale. He crept\ncloser to Trot and took her hand in his own, pressing it to give the\nlittle girl courage. As for Cap'n Bill, he was watching the smiling\nface of the Witch in a puzzled but not hopeless way, for he thought she\ndid not seem wholly in earnest in what she had said.\n\n\"The case is decided,\" announced Tourmaline in a clear, cold voice.\n\"The three strangers shall be taken at once to the edge of the island\nand thrown over the bushes into the sky.\"\n\n\"It's raining hard outside,\" announced Coralie, who sat near the door.\n\"Why not wait until this shower is over?\"\n\n\"I have said 'at once,'\" replied the little Queen with dignity, \"and so\nit must be at once. We are accustomed to rain, so it need not delay us,\nand when a disagreeable duty is to be performed, the sooner it is\naccomplished the better.\"\n\n\"May I ask, ma'am,\" said Cap'n Bill, addressing the Witch, \"why you\nhave decided to murder of us in this cold-blooded way?\"\n\n\"I did not decide to murder you,\" answered Rosalie.\n\n\"To throw us off the island will be murder,\" declared the sailor.\n\n\"Then they cannot throw you off,\" the Witch replied.\n\n\"The Queen says they will.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Rosalie, \"but I'm quite positive her people can't do it.\"\n\nThis statement astonished all the Pinkies, who looked at the Witch\ninquiringly. \"Why not?\" asked Tourmaline.\n\n\"It is evident to me,\" said the Witch, speaking slowly and distinctly,\n\"that these Earth people are protected in some way by fairies. They may\nnot be aware of this themselves, nor did I see any fairies in my\nvision. But if you will think upon it carefully, you will realize that\nthe Magic Umbrella has no power in itself, but is enchanted by fairy\npower so that it is made to fly and carry passengers through the air BY\nFAIRIES. This being the case, I do not think you will be allowed to\ninjure these favored people in any way; but I am curious to see in what\nmanner the fairies will defend them, and therefore I have voted to have\nthem thrown off the island. I bear these strangers no ill will, nor do\nI believe they are in any danger. But since you, Tourmaline, have\ndetermined to attempt this terrible thing at once, I shall go with you\nand see what will happen.\"\n\nSome of the Pinkies looked pleased and some troubled at this speech,\nbut they all prepared to escort the prisoners to the nearest edge of\nthe island. The rain was pouring down in torrents, and umbrellas were\nunknown; but all of them, both men and women, slipped gossamer\nraincoats over their clothing, which kept the rain from wetting them.\nThen they caught up their sharp sticks and surrounding the doomed\ncaptives commanded them to march to meet their fate.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ARRIVAL OF POLYCHROME\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nCap'n Bill had determined to fight desperately for their lives, but he\nwas a shrewd old sailorman, and he found much that was reasonable in\nthe Witch's assertion that fairies would protect them. He had often\nwondered how the Magic Umbrella could fly and obey spoken commands, but\nnow he plainly saw that the thing must be directed by some invisible\npower, and that power was quite likely to save them from the cruel\ndeath that had been decreed. To be sure, the Magic Umbrella was now in\nthe Blue Country, and the fairies that directed its flight might be\nwith the umbrella instead of with them, yet the old sailor had already\nexperienced some strange adventures in Trot's company and knew she had\nmanaged to escape every danger that had threatened. So he decided not\nto fight until the last moment and meekly hobbled along the street as\nhe was commanded to do. Trot was also encouraged by the Witch's\nsuggestion, for she believed in fairies and trusted them; but\nButton-Bright could find no comfort in their situation, and his face\nwas very sad as he marched along by Trot's side.\n\nIf they had followed the corkscrew windings of the street, it would\nhave been a long journey to the outer edge of the Pink Country, but\nTourmaline took a shortcut, leading them through private gardens and\neven through houses, so that they followed almost a bee line to their\ndestination. It rained all the way and the walking was very\ndisagreeable, but our friends were confronting an important crisis in\ntheir strange adventures, and with possible death at their journey's\nend, they were in no hurry to arrive there.\n\nOnce free of the City they traversed the open country, and here they\noften stepped into sticky, pink mud up to their ankles. Cap'n Bill's\nwooden leg would often go down deep and stick fast in this mud, and at\nsuch times he would be helpless until two of the Pinkies--who were a\nstrong people--pulled him out again. The parrot was getting its\nfeathers sadly draggled in the rain, and the poor bird soon presented a\nwet and woebegone appearance.\n\n  \"Soak us again,\n  Drown us with rain!\"\n\nit muttered in a resigned tone; and then it would turn to Trot and\nmoan, \"The rose is red, the violet's blue, The Pinkies are a beastly\ncrew!\"\n\nThe country was not so trim and neatly kept near the edge, for it was\nevident the people did not care to go too near to the dangerous place.\nThere was a row of thick bushes which concealed the gulf below, and as\nthey approached these bushes the rain abruptly ceased, and the clouds\nbegan to break and drift away in the sky. \"Two of you seize the girl\nand throw her over,\" said Tourmaline in a calm, matter-of-fact way,\n\"and two others must throw the boy over. It may take four, perhaps, to\nlift the huge and ancient man.\"\n\n\"More'n that,\" said Cap'n Bill grimly. \"I'm pretty sure it'll take all\no' you, young lady, an' the chances are you won't do it then.\"\n\nThey had halted a short distance from the bushes, and now there\nsuddenly appeared through a rift in the clouds an immense Rainbow. It\nwas perfectly formed and glistened with a dozen or more superb tintings\nthat were so vivid and brilliant and blended into one another so\nexquisitely that everyone paused to gaze enraptured upon the sight.\nSteadily, yet with wonderful swiftness, the end of the great bow\ndescended until it rested upon the pink field--almost at the feet of\nthe little party of observers. Then they saw, dancing gaily upon the\narch, a score of beautiful maidens, dressed in fleecy robes of rainbow\ntints which fluttered around them like clouds.\n\n\"The Daughters of the Rainbow!\" whispered Tourmaline in an awed voice,\nand the Witch beside her nodded and said, \"Fairies of the sky. What did\nI tell you, Tourmaline?\"\n\nJust then one of the maidens tripped lightly down the span of the arch\nuntil near the very end, leaning over to observe the group below. She\nwas exquisitely fair, dainty as a lily and graceful as a bough swaying\nin the breeze. \"Why, it's Polychrome!\" exclaimed Button-Bright in a\nvoice of mingled wonder and delight. \"Hello, Polly! Don't you remember\nme?\"\n\n\"Of course I remember Button-Bright,\" replied the maiden in a sweet,\ntinkling voice. \"The last time I saw you was in the Land of Oz.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Trot, turning to stare at the boy with big, wide-open eyes.\n\"Were you ever in the Land of Oz?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, still looking at the Rainbow's Daughter, and then\nhe said appealingly, \"These people want to kill us, Polly. Can't you\nhelp us?\"\n\n  \"Polly wants a cracker!\n  Polly wants a cracker!\"\n\nscreeched the parrot.\n\nPolychrome straightened up and glanced at her sisters. \"Tell Father to\ncall for me in an hour or two,\" said she. \"There is work for me to do\nhere, for one of my old friends is in trouble.\"\n\nWith this she sprang lightly from the rainbow and stood beside\nButton-Bright and Trot, and scarcely had she left the splendid arch\nwhen it lifted and rose into the sky. The other end had been hidden in\nthe clouds, and now the Rainbow began to fade gradually, like mist, and\nthe sun broke through the clouds and shot its cheering rays over the\nPink Country until presently the Rainbow had vanished altogether and\nthe only reminder of it was the lovely Polychrome standing among the\nwondering band of Pinkies. \"Tell me,\" she said gently to the boy, \"why\nare you here, and why do these people of the sky wish to destroy you?\"\n\nIn a few hurried words Button-Bright related their adventures with the\nMagic Umbrella and how the Boolooroo had stolen it and they had been\nobliged to escape into the Pink Country. Polychrome listened and then\nturned to the Queen. \"Why have you decreed death to these innocent\nstrangers?\" she asked.\n\n\"They do not harmonize with our color scheme,\" replied Tourmaline.\n\n\"That is utter nonsense,\" declared Polychrome impatiently. \"You're so\ndreadfully pink here that your color, which in itself is beautiful, had\nbecome tame and insipid. What you really need is some sharp contrast to\nenhance the charm of your country, and to keep these three people here\nwould be a benefit rather than an injury to you.\"\n\nAt this, the Pinkies looked downcast and ashamed, while only Rosalie\nthe Witch laughed and seemed to enjoy the rebuke. \"But,\" protested\nTourmaline, \"the Great Book of Laws says our country shall harbor none\nbut the Pinkies.\"\n\n\"Does it indeed?\" asked the Rainbow's Daughter. \"Come, let us return at\nonce to your City and examine your Book of Laws. I am quite sure I can\nfind in them absolute protection for these poor wanderers.\"\n\nThey dared not disobey Polychrome's request, so at once they all turned\nand walked back to the City. As it was still muddy underfoot, the\nRainbow's Daughter took a cloak from one of the women, partly rolled\nit, and threw it upon the ground. Then she stepped upon it and began\nwalking forward. The cloak unrolled as she advanced, affording a\nconstant carpet for her feet and for those of the others who followed\nher. So, being protected from the mud and wet, they speedily gained the\nCity and in a short time were all gathered in the low room of\nTourmaline's palace, where the Great Book of Laws lay upon a table.\n\nPolychrome began turning over the leaves, while the others all watched\nher anxiously and in silence. \"Here,\" she said presently, \"is a Law\nwhich reads as follows: 'Everyone in the Pink Country is entitled to\nthe protection of the Ruler and to a house and a good living, except\nonly the Blueskins. If any of the natives of the Blue Country should\never break through the Fog Bank, they must be driven back with sharp\nsticks.' Have you read this Law, Tourmaline?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Queen, \"but how does that apply to these strangers?\"\n\n\"Why, being in the Pink Country, as they surely are, and not being\nBlueskins, they are by this Law entitled to protection, to a home and\ngood living. The Law does not say 'Pinkies,' it says any who are in the\nPink Country.\"\n\n\"True,\" agreed Coralie, greatly pleased, and all the other Pinkies\nnodded their heads and repeated, \"True, true!\"\n\n  \"The rose is red, the violet's blue,\n  The law's the thing, because it's true!\"\n\ncried the parrot.\n\n\"I am indeed relieved to have you interpret the Law in this way,\"\ndeclared Tourmaline. \"I knew it was cruel to throw these poor people\nover the edge, but that seemed to us the only thing to be done.\"\n\n\"It was cruel and unjust,\" answered Polychrome as sternly as her sweet\nvoice could speak. \"But here,\" she added, for she had still continued\nto turn the leaves of the Great Book, \"is another Law which you have\nalso overlooked. It says, 'The person, whether man or woman, boy or\ngirl, living in the Pink Country who has the lightest skin shall be the\nRuler--King or Queen--as long as he or she lives, unless someone of a\nlighter skin is found, and this Ruler's commands all the people must\nobey.' Do you know this Law?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" replied Tourmaline. \"That is why I am the Queen. You will\nnotice my complexion is of a lighter pink than that of any other of my\npeople.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" remarked Polychrome, looking at her critically, \"when you were\nmade Queen without doubt you had the lightest-colored skin in all the\nPink Country. But now you are no longer Queen of the Pinkies,\nTourmaline.\"\n\nThose assembled were so startled by this statement that they gazed at\nthe Rainbow's Daughter in astonishment for a time. Then Tourmaline\nasked, \"Why not, your Highness?\"\n\n\"Because here is one lighter in color than yourself,\" pointed to Trot.\n\"This girl is, by the Law of the Great Book, the rightful Queen of the\nPinkies, and as loyal citizens you are all obliged to obey her\ncommands. Give me that circlet from your brow, Tourmaline.\" Without\nhesitation Tourmaline removed the rose-gold circlet with its glittering\njewel and handed it to Polychrome, who turned and placed it upon Trot's\nbrow. Then she called in a loud, imperative voice, \"Greet your new\nQueen, Pinkies!\"\n\nOne by one they all advanced, knelt before Trot and pressed her hand to\ntheir lips. \"Long live Queen Mayre!\" called out Cap'n Bill, dancing\naround on his wooden leg in great delight. \"Vive la--Vive la--ah, ah,\nTrot!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Polly,\" said Button-Bright gratefully. \"This will fix us\nall right, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Why, I have done nothing,\" returned Polychrome, smiling upon him. \"It\nis the Law of the Country. Isn't it surprising how little people know\nof their Laws? Are you all contented, Pinkies?\" she asked, turning to\nthe people.\n\n\"We are!\" they cried. Then several of the men ran out to spread the\nnews throughout the City and Country, so that a vast crowd soon began\nto gather in the Court of the Statues.\n\n\n\n\nMAYRE, QUEEN OF THE PINK COUNTRY\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nPolychrome now dismissed all but Button-Bright, Cap'n Bill, Rosalie the\nWitch and the new Queen of the Pinkies. Tourmaline hastened away to her\nfather's house to put on a beautiful gown all covered with flounces and\nribbons, for she was glad to be relieved of the duties of the Queen and\nwas eager to be gaily dressed and one of the people again.\n\n\"I s'pose,\" said Trot, \"I'll have to put on one of Tourmaline's common\npink dresses.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Polychrome, \"you must follow the customs of the country,\nabsurd though they may be. In the little sleeping chamber adjoining\nthis room you will find plenty of gowns poor enough for the Queen to\nwear. Shall I assist you to put one on?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Trot, \"I guess I can manage it alone.\"\n\nWhen she withdrew to the little chamber, the Rainbow's Daughter began\nconversing with the Witch, whom she urged to stay with the new queen\nand protect her as long as she ruled the Pink Country. Rosalie, who\nlonged to please the powerful Polychrome, whose fairy powers as\nDaughters of the Rainbow were far superior to her own witchcraft,\npromised faithfully to devote herself to Queen Mayre as long as she\nmight need her services.\n\nBy the time Trot was dressed in pink and had returned to the room,\nthere was an excited and clamorous crowd assembled in the court, and\nPolychrome took the little girl's hand and led her out to greet her new\nsubjects. The Pinkies were much impressed by the fact that the\nRainbow's Daughter was their new Queen's friend, and that Rosalie the\nWitch stood on Trot's left hand and treated her with humble deference.\nSo they shouted their approval very enthusiastically and pressed\nforward one by one to kneel before their new Ruler and kiss her hand.\n\nThe parrot was now on Cap'n Bill's shoulder, for Trot thought a Queen\nought not to carry a bird around, but the parrot did not mind the\nchange and was as much excited as anyone in the crowd. \"Oh, what bliss\nto kiss a miss!\" he shouted as Trot held out her hand to be kissed by\nher subjects, and then he would scream,\n\n  \"We're in the sky and flyin' high;\n  We're goin' to live instead of die,\n  It's time to laugh instead of cry;\n  Oh, my! Ki-yi! Ain't this a pie?\"\n\nCap'n Bill let the bird jabber as he pleased, for the occasion was a\njoyful one, and it was no wonder the parrot was excited. And while the\nthrong shouted greetings to the Queen, suddenly the great Rainbow\nappeared in the sky and dropped its end right on the Court of the\nStatues. Polychrome stooped to kiss Trot and Button-Bright, gave Cap'n\nBill a charming smile and Rosalie the Witch a friendly nod of farewell.\nThen she sprang lightly upon the arch of the Rainbow and was greeted by\nthe bevy of dancing, laughing maidens who were her sisters. \"I shall\nkeep watch over you, Button-Bright,\" she called to the boy. \"Don't\ndespair, whatever happens, for behind the clouds is always the Rainbow!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Polly,\" he answered, and Trot also thanked the lovely\nPolychrome, and so did Cap'n Bill. The parrot made quite a long speech,\nflying high above the arch where Polychrome stood and then back to\nCap'n Bill's shoulder. Said he,\n\n  \"We Pollys know our business, and we're all right!\n  We'll take good care of Cap'n Bill and Trot and Button-Bright.\n  You watch 'em from the Rainbow, and I'll watch day and night,\n  And we'll call a sky policeman if trouble comes in sight!\"\n\nSuddenly, the bow lifted and carried the dancing maidens into the sky.\nThe colors faded, the arch slowly dissolved and the heavens were clear.\nTrot turned to the Pinkies. \"Let's have a holiday today,\" she said.\n\"Have a good time and enjoy yourselves. I don't jus' know how I'm goin'\nto rule this country yet, but I'll think it over an' let you know.\"\nThen she went into the palace hut with Cap'n Bill and Button-Bright and\nRosalie the Witch, and the people went away to enjoy themselves and\ntalk over the surprising events of the day.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Trot, throwing herself into a chair, \"wasn't that a\nsudden change of fortune, though? That Rainbow's Daughter is a pretty\ngood fairy. I'm glad you know her, Button-Bright.\"\n\n\"I was sure something would happen to save you,\" remarked Rosalie, \"and\nthat was why I voted to have you thrown off the edge. I wanted to\ndiscover who would come to your assistance, and I found out. Now I have\nmade a friend of Polychrome, and that will render me more powerful as a\nWitch, for I can call upon her for assistance whenever I need her.\"\n\n\"But see here,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"You can't afford to spend your time\na-rulin' this tucked-up country, Trot.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Trot, who was pleased with her new and important\nposition.\n\n\"It'd get pretty tiresome, mate, after you'd had a few quarrels with\nthe Pinkies, for they expec' their Queen to be as poor as poverty an'\nnever have any fun in life.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't like it for long, I'm sure,\" added Button-Bright\nseriously.\n\nTrot seemed thoughtful. \"No, I don't know's I would,\" she admitted.\n\"But as long as we stay here, it seems a pretty good thing to be Queen.\nI guess I'm a little proud of it. I wish mother could see me rulin' the\nPinkies, an' Papa Griffith, too. Wouldn't they open their eyes?\"\n\n\"They would, mate, but they can't see you,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"So the\nquestion is, what's to be done?\"\n\n\"We ought to get home,\" observed the boy. \"Our folks will worry about\nus, and Earth's the best place to live, after all. If we could only get\nhold of my Magic Umbrella, we'd be all right.\"\n\n  \"The rose is red, the violet's blue,\n  But the umbrel's stolen by the Boolooroo!\"\n\nscreamed the parrot.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"The Boolooroo's got the umbrel, an' that\nsettles the question.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Rosalie, \"If you had your Magic Umbrella, could you fly\nhome again in safety?\"\n\n\"Of course we could,\" replied Button-Bright.\n\n\"And would you prefer to go home to remaining here?\"\n\n\"We would indeed!\"\n\n\"Then why do you not get the umbrella?\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Trot eagerly.\n\n\"You must go into the Blue Country and force the Boolooroo to give up\nyour property.\"\n\n\"Through the Fog Bank?\" asked Cap'n Bill doubtfully.\n\n\"And let the Boolooroo capture us again?\" demanded Button-Bright with a\nshiver.\n\n\"An' have to wait on the Snubnoses instead of bein' a Queen?\" said Trot.\n\n\"You must remember that conditions have changed, and you are now a\npowerful Ruler,\" replied Rosalie. \"The Pinkies are really a great\nnation, and they are pledged to obey your commands. Why not assemble an\narmy, march through the Fog Bank, fight and conquer the Boolooroo and\nrecapture the Magic Umbrella?\"\n\n\"Hooray!\" shouted Cap'n Bill, pounding his wooden leg on the floor.\n\"That's the proper talk! Let's do it, Queen Trot.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem like a bad idea,\" added Button-Bright.\n\n\"Do you think the Pinkies would fight the Blueskins?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Why not?\" replied the sailorman. \"They have sharp sticks an' know how\nto use 'em, whereas the Blueskins have only them windin'-up cords with\nweights on the ends.\"\n\n\"The Blueskins are the biggest people,\" said the girl.\n\n\"But they're cowards, I'm sure,\" declared the boy.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" the sailor remarked, \"that's our only hope of ever gett'n'\nhome again. I'd like to try it, Trot.\"\n\n\"If you decide on this adventure,\" said Rosalie, \"I believe I can be of\nmuch assistance to you.\"\n\n\"That'll help,\" asserted Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"And we've one good friend among the Blueskins,\" said Button-Bright.\n\"I'm sure Ghip-Ghisizzle will side with us, and I've got the Royal\nRecord Book, which proves that the Boolooroo has already reigned his\nlawful three hundred years.\"\n\n\"Does the book say that?\" inquired Trot with interest.\n\n\"Yes, I've been reading it.\"\n\n\"Then Sizzle'll be the new Boolooroo,\" said the girl, \"an' p'raps we\nwon't have to fight, after all.\"\n\n\"We'd better go prepared, though,\" advised Cap'n Bill, \"fer that awful\nol' Boolooroo won't give up without a struggle. When shall we start?\"\n\nTrot hesitated, so they all looked to Rosalie for advice. \"Just as soon\nas we can get the army together and ready,\" decided the Witch. \"That\nwill not take long. Perhaps two or three days.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried Cap'n Bill, and the parrot screamed,\n\n  \"Here's a lovely how-d'y'-do--\n  We're going to fight the Boolooroo!\n  We'll get the Six Snubnoses, too,\n  And make 'em all feel mighty blue.\"\n\n\"Either that or the other thing,\" said Trot. \"Anyhow, we're in for it.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WAR OF THE PINKS AND BLUES\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\nMuch to the surprise of the Earth people, the Pinkies made no objection\nwhatever to undertaking the adventure. Their lives were so monotonous\nand uninteresting that they welcomed anything in the way of excitement.\nThis march through the unknown Fog Bank to fight the unknown Blueskins\naroused them to enthusiasm, and although the result of the expedition\ncould not be foretold and some of them were almost certain to get hurt,\nthey did not hesitate to undertake the war.\n\nIt appeared that Coralie was Captain of the Sunset Tribe and a man\nnamed Tintint the Captain of the Sunrise Tribe. Tintint had a very pink\nskin and eyes so faded in their pink color that he squinted badly in\norder to see anything around him. He was a fat and pompous little\nfellow and loved to strut up and down his line of warriors twirling his\nlong, pointed stick so that all might admire him.\n\nBy Rosalie's advice the Army of Conquest consisted of one hundred\nSunsets and one hundred Sunrises. Many more were eager to go, but the\nWitch thought that would be enough. The warriors consisted of both men\nand women, equally divided, and there was no need to provide uniforms\nfor them because their regular pink clothing was a distinctive uniform\nin itself. Each one bore a long, pointed stick as the main weapon and\nhad two short, pointed sticks stuck in his belt.\n\nWhile the army was getting ready, Rosalie the Witch went to the central\nedge of the Fog Bank and fearlessly entered it. There she called for\nthe King of the Giant Frogs, who came at her bidding, and the two held\nan earnest and long talk together. Meantime, Cap'n Bill had the army\nassembled in the Court of the Statues, where Queen Mayre appeared and\ntold the Pinkies that the sailorman was to be Commander in Chief of the\nExpedition and all must obey his commands. Then Cap'n Bill addressed\nthe army and told them what the Fog Bank was like. He advised them all\nto wear their raincoats over their pretty pink clothes so they would\nnot get wet, and he assured them that all the creatures to be met with\nin the Fog were perfectly harmless.\n\n\"When we come to the Blue Country, though,\" he added, \"you're liable to\nbe pretty busy. The Blueskins are tall an' lanky, an' ugly an' fierce,\nan' if they happen to capture you, you'll all be patched, which is a\ndeep disgrace an' a uncomfortable mix-up.\"\n\n\"Will they throw us over the edge?\" asked Captain Tintint.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" replied Cap'n Bill. \"While I was there I never\nheard the edge mentioned. They're cruel enough to do that--'specially\nthe Boolooroo--but I guess they've never thought o' throwin' folks over\nthe edge. They fight with long cords that have weights on the ends,\nwhich coil 'round you an' make you helpless in a jiffy; so whenever\nthey throw them cords you mus' ward 'em off with your long sticks.\nDon't let 'em wind around your bodies, or you're done for.\"\n\nHe told them other things about the Blueskins, so they would not be\nfrightened when they faced the enemy and found them so different in\nappearance from themselves, and also he assured them that the Pinkies\nwere so much the braver and better armed that he had no doubt they\nwould easily conquer.\n\nOn the third day, just at sunrise, the army moved forward to the Fog\nBank, headed by Cap'n Bill, clad in an embroidered pink coat with wide,\nflowing pink trousers, and accompanied by Trot and Button-Bright and\nRosalie the Witch, all bundled up in their pink raincoats. The parrot\nwas there, too, as the bird refused to be left behind.\n\nThey had not advanced far into the deep fog when they were halted by a\nqueer barrier consisting of a long line of gigantic frogs, crouching so\nclose together that no Pinkie could squeeze between them. As the heads\nof the frogs were turned the other way, toward the Blue Country, the\narmy could not at first imagine what the barrier was. But Rosalie said\nto them, \"Our friends the frogs have agreed to help us through the Fog\nBank. Climb upon their backs, as many on each frog as are able to hold\non, and then we shall make the journey more quickly.\" Obeying this\ninjunction, the Pinkies began climbing upon the frogs, and by crowding\nclose together, all were able to find places. On the back of the King\nFrog rode Trot and her parrot, besides Rosalie, Button-Bright, Cap'n\nBill and the captains of the two companies of the army.\n\nWhen all were seated, clinging to one another so they would not slide\noff, Cap'n Bill gave the word of command and away leaped the frogs, all\ntogether. They bounded a long distance at this jump--some farther than\nothers--and as soon as they landed they jumped again, without giving\ntheir passengers a chance to get their breaths. It was a bewildering\nand exciting ride, but a dozen of the huge jumps accomplished the\njourney, and at the edge of the Fog Bank each frog stopped so suddenly\nthat the Pinkies went flying over their heads to tumble into the blue\nfields of the Blue Country, where they rolled in a confused mass until\nthey could recover and scramble to their feet. No one was hurt,\nhowever, and the King Frog had been wise enough to treat his passengers\nmore gently by slowing down at the edge and allowing his riders to slip\nto the ground very comfortably.\n\nCap'n Bill at once formed his army into line of battle and had them all\nremove the cumbersome raincoats, which they piled in a heap at the edge\nof the Fog Bank. It was a splendid array of warriors, and from where\nthey stood they could discover several Blueskins rushing in a panic\ntoward the Blue City as fast as their long, blue legs could carry them.\n\n\"Well, they know we're here, anyhow,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"and instead of\nwaitin' to see what'll they do, I guess we'll jus' march on the City\nan' ask 'em to please surrender.\"\n\n\n\n\nGHIP-GHISIZZLE HAS A BAD TIME\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\nThe Boolooroo was quite busy at the time the Pinkies invaded his\ncountry. He had discovered the loss of the Book of Records, and after\nbeing frightened 'most to death at the prospect of his fraud on the\npeople's being made public, he decided to act boldly and hold his\nposition as Boolooroo at any cost.\n\nSince Ghip-Ghisizzle was to be the next Boolooroo, the king suspected\nhim first of all, so he had the Majordomo bound with cords and brought\nbefore him, when he accused him of stealing the Book of Records. Of\ncourse, Ghip-Ghisizzle denied taking the Book, but he became almost as\nnervous at its loss as had the Boolooroo. He secretly believed that\nButton-Bright had taken the Book from the Treasure Chamber, and if this\nwere true it might prove as great a misfortune as if the king had kept\nit locked up. For Button-Bright had escaped into the Fog Bank, and\nGhip-Ghisizzle was afraid the boy would never again be seen in the Blue\nCountry.\n\nHe did not tell the Boolooroo of this suspicion, because in that case\nthe king would realize he was secure and that his deception could never\nbe proved against him. The Majordomo simply denied taking the Record\nBook, and the Boolooroo did not believe he spoke truly. To prevent his\nrival from ever becoming the Ruler of the Blue Country, the Boolooroo\ndetermined to have him patched, but for some time he could find no\nother Blueskin to patch him with. No one had disobeyed a command or\ndone anything wrong, so the king was in a quandary until he discovered\nthat a servant named Tiggle had mixed the royal nectar for Cap'n Bill,\nwho had been ordered to do it at the time of his capture. This was\nsufficient excuse for the Boolooroo, who at once had Tiggle made a\nprisoner and brought before him.\n\nThis servant was not so long-legged as Ghip-Ghisizzle, and his head was\nthicker and his nose flatter. But that pleased the Boolooroo all the\nmore. He realized that when the great knife had sliced the prisoners in\ntwo and their halves were patched together, they would present a\nridiculous sight and all the Blueskins would laugh at them and avoid\nthem. So on the very morning that the Pinkies arrived, the Boolooroo\nhad ordered his two prisoners brought into the room of the palace where\nthe Great Knife stood, and his soldiers were getting ready to perform\nthe operation of patching Ghip-Ghisizzle with Tingle when a messenger\ncame running to say that a great army of the Pinkies had broken through\nthe Fog Bank.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said the Boolooroo, \"I'll attend to them in a minute. I'm\nbusy now.\"\n\n\"They are marching on the City,\" said the frightened messenger. \"If you\ndelay, Most High and Mighty One, we shall all be captured. You'd better\nsave your City first and do your patching afterward.\"\n\n\"What!\" roared the Boolooroo. \"Dare you dictate to me?\" But he was\nimpressed by the man's logic. After locking the prisoners, who were\nstill bound, in the Room of the Great Knife, the Ruler hurried away to\nassemble his soldiers. By this time the Pinkies had advanced halfway to\nthe walls of the City, so the first thing the Boolooroo did was to\norder all the gates closed and locked, and then he placed a line of\nsoldiers on the wall to prevent any of the Pinkies from climbing over.\nTherefore, when Cap'n Bill's army reached the wall, he was obliged to\nhalt his ranks until he could find a way to enter the City.\n\nNow when the Boolooroo looked through the blue-steel bars of the main\ngate and saw the enemy armed with sharp-pointed sticks, he began to\ntremble; and when he thought how painful it would be to have his body\nand arms and legs prodded and pricked by such weapons, he groaned aloud\nand was very miserable. But the thought occurred to him that if he\ncould avoid being caught by the Pinkies, they would be unable to harm\nhim. So he went among his people and reminded them how horrible it\nwould feel to be punched full of holes by the invaders and urged them\nto fight desperately and drive the Pinkies back into the Fog Bank.\n\nOnly a few of the Blueskins were soldiers, and these all belonged to\nthe King's bodyguard, but the citizens realized that they must indeed\nfight bravely to save themselves from getting hurt, so they promised\nthe Boolooroo to do all they could. They armed themselves with long\ncords having weights fastened to the ends and practiced throwing these\nweights in such a manner that the cords would wind around their\nenemies. Also, they assembled in the streets in small groups and told\neach other in frightened whispers that all their trouble was due to the\nBoolooroo's cruel treatment of the Earth people. If he had received\nthem as friends instead of making them slaves, they would never have\nescaped to the Pinkies and brought an army into the Blue Country that\nthey might be revenged. The Blueskins had not liked their Boolooroo\nbefore this, and now they began to hate him, forgetting they had also\ntreated the strangers in a very disagreeable manner.\n\nMeantime, the Six Snubnosed Princesses had seen from their rooms in a\ntower of the palace the army of the Pinkies marching upon them, and the\nsight had served to excite them greatly. They had been quarreling\nbitterly among themselves all morning, and strangely enough this\nquarrel was all about which of them should marry Ghip-Ghisizzle. They\nknew that some day the Majordomo would become Boolooroo, and each one\nof the six had determined to marry him so as to be Queen and thus force\nher sisters to obey her commands. They paid no attention to the fact\nthat Ghip-Ghisizzle did not want to marry any of them, for they had\ndetermined that when it was agreed who should have him, they would ask\ntheir father to force the man to marry.\n\nWhile they quarreled in one room of the palace, Ghip-Ghisizzle was in\ndanger of being patched in another room; but the Six Snubnosed\nPrincesses did not know that. The arrival of the Pinkies gave them\nsomething new to talk about, so they hurried downstairs and along the\ncorridors so as to gain the courtyard and take part in the exciting\nscenes. But as they passed the closed doors of the Room of the Great\nKnife, they heard a low moan and stopped to listen. The moan was\nrepeated, and being curious, they unlocked the door--the key having\nbeen left on the outside--and entered the room.\n\nAt once, the Pinkies were forgotten, for there upon the floor, tightly\nbound, lay Ghip-Ghisizzle, and beside him poor Tiggle, who had uttered\nthe moans.\n\nThe six Princesses sat down in a circle facing the captives, and\nCerulia said, \"Ghip, my dear, we will release you on one condition:\nThat you choose a wife from among us and promise to marry the one\nselected as soon as the Pinkies are driven back into the Fog Bank.\"\n\nGhip-Ghisizzle managed to shake his head. Then he said, \"Really,\nladies, you must excuse me. I'd rather be patched than mismatched, as I\nwould be with a lovely, snub-nosed wife. You are too beautiful for me;\ngo seek your husbands elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Monster!\" cried Indigo. \"If you choose me, I'll scratch your eyes out!\"\n\n\"If you choose me,\" said Cobalt in a rage, \"I'll tear out your hair by\nthe roots!\"\n\n\"If I am to be your wife,\" screamed Azure, \"I'll mark your obstinate\nface with my fingernails!\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Turquoise passionately, \"will pound your head with a\nbroomstick!\"\n\n\"I'll shake him till his teeth rattle!\" shrieked Sapphire.\n\n\"The best way to manage a husband,\" observed Cerulia angrily, \"is to\npull his nose.\"\n\n\"Ladies,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle when he had a chance to speak, \"do not\nanticipate these pleasures, I beg of you, for I shall choose none among\nyou for a wife.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" said Indigo.\n\n\"I think you will soon change your mind,\" added Azure.\n\n\"I'm going to be patched to Tingle, here, as soon as the Boolooroo\nreturns,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle, \"and it's against the law for a patched\nman to marry anyone. It's regarded as half-bigamy.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" cried Cerulia. \"If he's patched, he never can be Boolooroo.\"\n\n\"Then he musn't be patched,\" declared Sapphire. \"We must save him from\nthat fate, girls, and force him to decide among us. Otherwise, none of\nus can ever be the Queen.\"\n\nThis being evident, they proceeded to unbind the long legs of\nGhip-Ghisizzle, leaving his body and arms, however, tied fast together.\nThen between them they got him upon his feet and led him away, paying\nno attention to poor Tiggle, who whined to be released so he could\nfight in the war. After a hurried consultation, the Six Snubnosed\nPrincesses decided to hide the Majordomo in one of their boudoirs, so\nthey dragged him up the stairs to their reception room and fell to\nquarreling as to whose boudoir should be occupied by their captive. Not\nbeing able to settle the question, they finally locked him up in a\nvacant room across the hall and told him he must stay there until he\nhad decided to marry one of the Princesses and could make a choice\namong them.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF CAP'N BILL\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\nWhile this was transpiring in the palace, Cap'n Bill and the Pinkies\nhad encamped before the principal gate of the City and a tent had been\npitched for Trot and Button-Bright and Rosalie. The army had been very\nfearful and weak-kneed when it first entered the Blue Country, but\nperceiving that the Boolooroo and his people were afraid of them and\nhad locked themselves up in the City, the Pinkies grew bolder and\nlonged to make an attack.\n\nOne of them, in his curiosity to examine the Blue City, got a little\ntoo near the wall, and a blue soldier threw his cord-and-weight at him.\nThe cord didn't wind around the Pinkie, as he was too far off, but the\nweight hit him in the eye and made him howl lustily as he trotted back\nto this comrades at full speed. After this experience, the invaders\nwere careful to keep a safe distance from the wall.\n\nThe Boolooroo, having made all preparations to receive the enemy, was\nannoyed because they held back. He was himself so nervous and excited\nthat he became desperate, and after an hour of tedious waiting, during\nwhich time he pranced around impatiently, he decided to attack the\nhated Pinkies and rid the country of them.\n\n\"Their dreadful color makes me hysterical,\" he said to his soldiers,\n\"so if I am to have any peace of mind, we must charge the foe and drive\nthem back into the Fog Bank. But take all the prisoners you can, my\nbrave men, and tomorrow we will have a jolly time patching them. Don't\nbe afraid; those pink creatures have no blue blood in their veins, and\nthey'll run like rabbits when they see us coming.\"\n\nThen he ordered the gate thrown open, and immediately the Blueskins\npoured out into the open plain and began to run toward the Pinkies. The\nBoolooroo went out, too, but he kept well behind his people,\nremembering the sharp sticks with which the enemy were armed.\n\nCap'n Bill was alert and had told his army what to do in case of an\nattack. The Pinkies did not run like rabbits, but formed a solid line\nand knelt down with their long, sharp sticks pointed directly toward\nthe Blueskins, the other ends being set firmly upon the ground. Of\ncourse, the Blueskins couldn't run against these sharp points, so they\nhalted a few feet away and began swinging their cord-and-weights. But\nthe Pinkies were too close together to be caught in this manner, and\nnow by command of Cap'n Bill they suddenly rose to their feet and began\njabbing their sticks at the foe. The Blueskins hesitated until a few\ngot pricked and began to yell with terror, when the whole of the\nBoolooroo's attacking party turned around and ran back to the gate,\ntheir Ruler reaching it first of all. The Pinkies tried to chase them,\nbut their round, fat legs were no match for the long, thin legs of the\nBlueskins, who quickly gained the gate and shut themselves up in the\nCity again.\n\n\"It is evident,\" panted the Boolooroo, facing his defeated soldiers\nwrathfully, \"that you are a pack of cowards!\"\n\n\"But we followed your own royal example in running,\" replied the\nCaptain.\n\n\"I merely ran back to the City to get a drink of water, for I was\nthirsty,\" declared the Boolooroo.\n\n\"So did we! So did we!\" cried the soldiers eagerly. \"We were all\nthirsty.\"\n\n\"Your High and Mighty Spry and Flighty Majesty,\" remarked the Captain\nrespectfully, \"it occurs to me that the weapons of the Pinkies are\nsuperior to our own. What we need in order to oppose them successfully\nis a number of sharp sticks which are longer than their own.\"\n\n\"True, true!\" exclaimed the Boolooroo enthusiastically. \"Get to work at\nonce and make yourselves long, sharp sticks, and then we will attack\nthe enemy again.\"\n\nSo the soldiers and citizens all set to work preparing long, sharp\nsticks, and while they were doing this, Rosalie the Witch had a vision\nin which she saw exactly what was going on inside the City wall. Queen\nTrot and Cap'n Bill and Button-Bright saw the vision, too, for they\nwere all in the tent together, and the sight made them anxious.\n\n\"What can be done?\" asked the girl. \"The Blueskins are bigger and\nstronger than the Pinkies, and if they have sharp sticks which are\nlonger than ours, they will surely defeat us.\"\n\n\"I have one magic charm,\" said Rosalie thoughtfully, \"that will save\nour army; but I am allowed to work only one magic charm every three\ndays--not oftener--and perhaps I'll need the magic for other things.\"\n\n\"Strikes me, ma'am,\" returned the sailor, \"that what we need most on\nthis expedition is to capture the Blueskins. If we don't, we'll need\nplenty of magic to help us back to the Pink Country; but if we do, we\ncan take care of ourselves without magic.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Rosalie. \"I will take your advice, Cap'n, and\nenchant the weapons of the Pinkies.\" She then went out and had all the\nPinkies come before her, one by one, and she enchanted their sharp\nsticks by muttering some cabalistic words and making queer passes with\nher hands over the weapons. \"Now,\" she said to them, \"you will be\npowerful enough to defeat the Blueskins whatever they may do.\" The\nPinkies were overjoyed at this promise, and it made them very brave\nindeed, since they now believed they would surely be victorious.\n\nWhen the Boolooroo's people were armed with long, thin, lances of\nbluewood all sharpened to fine points at one end, they prepared to\nmarch once more against the invaders. Their sticks were twice as long\nas those of the Pinkies, and the Boolooroo chuckled with glee to think\nwhat fun they would have in punching holes in the round, fat bodies of\nhis enemies.\n\nOut from the gate they marched very boldly and pressed on to attack the\nPinkies, who were drawn up in line of battle to receive them, with\nCap'n Bill at their head. When the opposing forces came together,\nhowever, and the Blueskins pushed their points against the Pinkies, the\nweapons which had been enchanted by Rosalie began to whirl in swift\ncircles--so swift that the eye could scarcely follow the motion. The\nresult was that the lances of the Boolooroo's people could not touch\nthe Pinkies, but were thrust aside with violence and either broken in\ntwo or sent hurling through the air in all directions. Finding\nthemselves so suddenly disarmed, the amazed Blueskins turned about and\nran again, while Cap'n Bill, greatly excited by his victory, shouted to\nhis followers to pursue the enemy, and hobbled after them as fast as he\ncould make his wooden leg go, swinging his sharp stick as he advanced.\n\nThe Blues were in such a frightened, confused mass that they got in one\nanother's way and could not make very good progress on the retreat, so\nthe old sailor soon caught up with them and began jabbing at the crowd\nwith his stick. Unfortunately, the Pinkies had not followed their\ncommander, being for the moment dazed by their success, so that Cap'n\nBill was all alone among the Blueskins when he stepped his wooden leg\ninto a hole in the ground and tumbled full length, his sharp stick\nflying from his hand and pricking the Boolooroo in the leg as it fell.\n\nAt this, the Ruler of the Blues stopped short in his flight to yell\nwith terror, but seeing that only the sailorman was pursuing them and\nthat this solitary foe had tumbled flat upon the ground, he issued a\ncommand and several of his people fell upon poor Cap'n Bill, seized him\nin their long arms, and carried him struggling into the City, where he\nwas fast bound.\n\nThen a panic fell upon the Pinkies at the loss of their leader, and\nTrot and Button-Bright called out in vain for them to rescue Cap'n\nBill. By the time the army recovered their wits and prepared to obey,\nit was too late. And although Trot ran with them in her eagerness to\nsave her friend, the gate was found to be fast barred, and she knew it\nwas impossible for them to force an entrance into the City.\n\nSo she went sorrowfully back to the camp, followed by the Pinkies, and\nasked Rosalie what could be done.\n\n\"I'm sure I do not know,\" replied the Witch. \"I cannot use another\nmagic charm until three days have expired, but if they do not harm\nCap'n Bill during that time, I believe I can then find a way to save\nhim.\"\n\n\"Three days is a long time,\" remarked Trot dismally.\n\n\"The Boolooroo may decide to patch him at once,\" added Button-Bright\nwith equal sadness, for he, too, mourned the sailor's loss.\n\n\"It can't be helped,\" replied Rosalie. \"I am not a fairy, my dears, but\nmerely a witch, and so my magic powers are limited. We can only hope\nthat the Boolooroo won't patch Cap'n Bill for three days.\"\n\nWhen night settled down upon the camp of the Pinkies, where many tents\nhad now been pitched, all the invaders were filled with gloom. The band\ntried to enliven them by playing the \"Dead March,\" but it was not a\nsuccess. The Pinkies were despondent in spite of the fact that they had\nrepulsed the attack of the Blues, for as yet they had not succeeded in\ngaining the City or finding the Magic Umbrella, and the blue dusk of\nthis dread country--which was so different from their own land of\nsunsets--made them all very nervous. They saw the moon rise for the\nfirst time in their lives, and its cold, silvery radiance made them\nshudder and prevented them from going to sleep. Trot tried to interest\nthem by telling them that on the Earth the people had both the sun and\nthe moon and loved them both; but nevertheless it is certain that had\nnot the terrible Fog Bank stood between them and the Pink Land, most of\nthe invading army would have promptly deserted and gone back home.\n\nTrot couldn't sleep, either, she was so worried over Cap'n Bill. She\nwent back to the tent where Rosalie and Button-Bright were sitting in\nthe moonlight and asked the Witch if there was no way in which she\ncould secretly get into the City of the Blues and search for her\nfriend. Rosalie thought it over for some time and then replied:\n\n\"We can make a rope ladder that will enable you to climb to the top of\nthe wall and descend into the City. But if anyone should see you, you\nwould be captured.\"\n\n\"I'll risk that,\" said the child, excited at the prospect of gaining\nthe side of Cap'n Bill in this adventurous way. \"Please make the rope\nladder at once, Rosalie!\"\n\nSo the Witch took some ropes and knotted together a ladder long enough\nto reach the top of the wall. When it was finished, the three--Rosalie,\nTrot and Button-Bright--stole out into the moonlight and crept\nunobserved into the shadow of the wall. The Blueskins were not keeping\na very close watch, as they were confident the Pinkies could not get\ninto the City.\n\nThe hardest part of Rosalie's task was to toss up one end of the rope\nladder until it would catch on some projection on top of the wall.\nThere were few such projections, but after creeping along the wall for\na distance, they saw the end of a broken flagstaff near the top edge.\nThe Witch tossed up the ladder, trying to catch it upon this point, and\non the seventh attempt she succeeded.\n\n\"Good!\" cried Trot. \"Now I can climb up.\"\n\n\"Don't you want me to go with you?\" asked Button-Bright a little\nwistfully.\n\n\"No,\" said the girl. \"You must stay to lead the army. And if you can\nthink of a way, you must try to rescue us. Perhaps I'll be able to save\nCap'n Bill by myself; but if I don't, it's all up to you,\nButton-Bright.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" he promised.\n\n\"And here, keep my polly till I come back,\" added Trot, giving him the\nbird. \"I can't take it with me, for it would be a bother, an' if it\ntried to spout po'try, I'd be discovered in a jiffy.\"\n\nAs the beautiful Witch kissed the little girl goodbye, she slipped upon\nher finger a curious ring. At once, Button-Bright exclaimed, \"Why,\nwhere has she gone?\"\n\n\"I'm right here,\" said Trot's voice by his side. \"Can't you see me?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the boy, mystified.\n\nRosalie laughed. \"It's a magic ring I've loaned you, my dear,\" said\nshe, \"and as long as you wear it, you will be invisible to all eyes,\nthose of Blueskins and Pinkies alike. I'm going to let you wear this\nwonderful ring, for it will save you from being discovered by your\nenemies. If at any time you wish to be seen, take the ring from your\nfinger; but as long as you wear it, no one can see you, not even Earth\npeople.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\" cried Trot. \"That will be fine.\"\n\n\"I see you have another ring on your hand,\" said Rosalie, \"and I\nperceive it is enchanted in some way. Where did you get it?\"\n\n\"The Queen of the Mermaids gave it to me,\" answered Trot. \"But Sky\nIsland is so far away from the sea that the ring won't do me any good\nwhile I'm here. It's only to call the mermaids to me if I need them,\nand they can't swim in the sky, you see.\"\n\nRosalie smiled and kissed her again. \"Be brave, my dear,\" she said,\n\"and I am sure you will be able to find Cap'n Bill without getting in\ndanger yourself. But be careful not to let any Blueskin touch you, for\nwhile you are in contact with any person you will become visible. Keep\nout of their way, and you will be perfectly safe. Don't lose the ring,\nfor you must give it back to me when you return. It is one of my\nwitchcraft treasures, and I need it in my business.\"\n\nThe Trot climbed the ladder, although neither Button-Bright nor Rosalie\ncould see her do so, and when she was on top the broad wall she pulled\nup the knotted ropes and began to search for a place to let it down on\nthe other side. A little way off she found a bluestone seat near to the\ninner edge, and attaching the ladder to this, she easily descended it\nand found herself in the Blue City. A guard was pacing up and down near\nher, but as he could not see the girl, he of course paid no attention\nto her. So after marking the place where the ladder hung that she might\nknow how to reach it again, Trot hurried away through the streets of\nthe city.\n\n\n\n\nTROT'S INVISIBLE ADVENTURE\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\n\nAll the Blueskins except a few soldiers had gone to bed and were sound\nasleep. A blue gloom hung over the city, which was scarcely relieved by\na few bluish, wavering lights here and there, but Trot knew the general\ndirection in which the palace lay, and she decided to go there first.\nShe believed the Boolooroo would surely keep so important a prisoner as\nCap'n Bill locked up in his own palace.\n\nOnce or twice the little girl lost her way, for the streets were very\npuzzling to one not accustomed to them, but finally she sighted the\ngreat palace and went up to the entrance. There she found a double\nguard posted. They were sitting on a bench outside the doorway, and\nboth stood up as she approached.\n\n\"We thought we heard footsteps,\" said one.\n\n\"So did we,\" replied the other, \"yet there is no one in sight.\"\n\nTrot then saw that the guards were the two patched men, Jimfred\nJonesjinks and Fredjim Jinksjones, who had been talking together quite\ncheerfully. It was the first time the girl had seen them together, and\nshe marveled at the queer patching that had been so strongly united\nhere, yet so thoroughly separated them.\n\n\"You see,\" remarked Jimfred as they seated themselves again upon the\nbench, \"The Boolooroo has ordered the patching to take place tomorrow\nmorning after breakfast. The old Earth man is to be patched to poor\nTiggle instead of Ghip-Ghisizzle, who has in some way managed to escape\nfrom the Room of the Great Knife--no one knows how but Tiggle, and\nTiggle won't tell.\"\n\n\"We're sorry for anyone who has to be patched,\" replied Fredjim in a\nreflective tone, \"for although it didn't hurt us as much as we\nexpected, it's a terrible mix-up to be in until we become used to our\nstrange combination. You and we are about alike, now, Jimfred, although\nwe were so different before.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said Jimfred. \"We are really more intelligent than you are,\nfor the left side of our brain was always the keenest before we were\npatched.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" admitted Fredjim, \"but we are much the strongest,\nbecause our right arm was by far the best before we were patched.\"\n\n\"We are not sure of that,\" responded Jimfred, \"for we have a right arm,\ntoo, and it is pretty strong.\"\n\n\"We will test it,\" suggested the other, \"by all pulling upon one end of\nthis bench with our right arms. Whichever can pull the bench from the\nothers must be the strongest.\"\n\nWhile they were tussling at the bench, dragging it first here and then\nthere in the trial of strength, Trot opened the door of the palace and\nwalked in. It was pretty dark in the hall, and only a few dim blue\nlights showed at intervals down the long corridors. As the girl walked\nthrough these passages, she could hear snores of various degrees coming\nfrom behind some of the closed doors and knew that all the regular\ninmates of the place were sound asleep. So she mounted to the upper\nfloor, and thinking she would be likely to find Cap'n Bill in the Room\nof the Great Knife, she went there and tried the door. It was locked,\nbut the key had been left on the outside. She waited until the sentry\nwho was pacing the corridor had his back toward her, and then she\nturned the key and slipped within, softly closing the door behind her.\n\nIt was pitch dark in the room, and Trot didn't know how to make a\nlight. After a moment's thought she began feeling her way to the\nwindow, stumbling over objects as she went. Every time she made a\nnoise, someone groaned, and that made the child uneasy. At last she\nfound a window and managed to open the shutters and let the moonlight\nin. It wasn't a very strong moonlight, but it enabled her to examine\nthe interior of the room. In the center stood the Great Knife, which\nthe Boolooroo used to split people in two when he patched them, and at\none side was a dark form huddled upon the floor and securely bound.\n\nTrot hastened to this form and knelt beside it, but was disappointed to\nfind it was only Tiggle. The man stirred a little and rolled against\nTrot's knee, when she at once became visible to him. \"Oh, it's the\nEarth child,\" said he. \"Are you condemned to be patched, too, little\none?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Trot. \"Tell me where Cap'n Bill is.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said Tiggle. \"The Boolooroo has hidden him until tomorrow\nmorning, when he's to be patched to me. Ghip-Ghisizzle was to have been\nmy mate, but Ghip escaped, being carried away by the Six Snubnosed\nPrincesses.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked.\n\n\"One of them means to marry him,\" explained Tiggle.\n\n\"Oh, that's worse than being patched!\" cried Trot.\n\n\"Much worse,\" said Tiggle with a groan.\n\nBut now an idea occurred to the girl. \"Would you like to escape?\" she\nasked the captive. \"If I get you out of the palace, can you hide\nyourself so that you won't be found?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" he declared. \"I know a house where I can hide so snugly\nthat all the Boolooroo's soldiers cannot find me.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Trot. \"I'll do it, for when you're gone, the\nBoolooroo will have no one to patch Cap'n Bill to.\"\n\n\"He may find someone else,\" suggested the prisoner.\n\n\"But it will take him time to do that, and time is all I want,\"\nanswered the child. Even while she spoke, Trot was busy with the knots\nin the cords, and presently she had unbound Tiggle, who soon got upon\nhis feet. \"Now I'll go to one end of the passage and make a noise,\"\nsaid she, \"and when the guard runs to see what it is, you must run the\nother way. Outside the palace, Jimfred and Fredjim are on guard, but if\nyou tip over the bench they are seated on, you can easily escape them.\"\n\n\"I'll do that, all right,\" promised the delighted Tiggle. \"You've made\na friend of me, little girl, and if ever I can help you, I'll do it\nwith pleasure.\"\n\nThen Trot started for the door, and Tiggle could no longer see her\nbecause she was not now touching him. The man was much surprised at her\ndisappearance, but listened carefully, and when he heard the girl make\na noise at one end of the corridor, he opened the door and ran in the\nopposite direction as he had been told to do.\n\nOf course, the guard could not discover what made the noise, and Trot\nran little risk, as she was careful not to let him touch her. When\nTiggle had escaped, the little girl wandered through the palace in\nsearch of Cap'n Bill, but soon decided such a quest in the dark was\nlikely to fail and she must wait until morning. She was tired, too, and\nthought she would find a vacant room--of which there were many in the\nbig palace--and go to sleep until daylight. She remembered there was a\ncomfortable vacant room just opposite the suite of the Six Snubnosed\nPrincesses, so she stole softly up to it and tried the door. It was\nlocked, but the key was outside, as the Blueskins seldom took a door\nkey from its place. So she turned the key, opened the door, and walked\nin.\n\nNow this was the chamber in which Ghip-Ghisizzle had been confined by\nthe Princesses, his arms being bound tight to his body, but his legs\nleft free. The Boolooroo in his search had failed to discover what had\nbecome of Ghip Ghisizzle, but the poor man had been worried every\nminute for fear his retreat would be discovered or that the terrible\nPrincesses would come for him and nag him until he went crazy. There\nwas one window in his room, and the prisoner had managed to push open\nthe sash with his knees. Looking out, he found that a few feet below\nthe window was the broad wall that ran all around the palace gardens. A\nlittle way to the right the wall joined the wall of the City, being on\nthe same level with it.\n\nGhip-Ghisizzle had been thinking deeply upon this discovery, and he\ndecided that if anyone entered his room, he would get through the\nwindow, leap down upon the wall, and try in this way to escape. It\nwould be a dangerous leap, for as his arms were bound, he might topple\noff the wall into the garden; but he resolved to take this chance.\nTherefore, when Trot rattled at the door of his room, Ghip-Ghisizzle\nran and seated himself upon the window sill, dangling his long legs\nover the edge. When she finally opened the door, he slipped off and let\nhimself fall to the wall, where he doubled up in a heap. The next\nminute, however, he had scrambled to his knees and was running swiftly\nalong the garden wall.\n\nTrot, finding the window open, came and looked out, and she saw the\nMajordomo's tall form hastening along the top of the wall. The guards\nsaw him, too, outlined against the sky in the moonlight, and they began\nyelling at him to stop, but Ghip-Ghisizzle kept right on until he\nreached the city Wall, when he began to follow that. More guards were\nyelling now, running along the foot of the wall to keep the fugitive in\nsight, and people began to pour out of the houses and join in the chase.\n\nPoor Ghip realized that if he kept on the wall, he would merely circle\nthe city and finally be caught. If he leaped down into the City, he\nwould be seized at once. Just then he came opposite the camp of the\nPinkies and decided to trust himself to the mercies of his Earth\nfriends rather than be made a prisoner by his own people, who would\nobey the commands of their detested but greatly feared Boolooroo. So\nsuddenly he gave a mighty leap and came down into the field outside the\ncity. Again he fell in a heap and rolled over and over, for it was a\nhigh wall and the jump a dangerous one; but finally he recovered and\ngot upon his feet, delighted to find he had broken none of his bones.\n\nSome of the Blueskins had by now opened a gate, and out rushed a crowd\nto capture the fugitive; but Ghip-Ghisizzle made straight for the camp\nof the Pinkies, and his pursuers did not dare follow him far in that\ndirection. They soon gave up the chase and returned to the City, while\nthe runaway Majordomo was captured by Captain Coralie and marched away\nto the tent of Rosalie the Witch, a prisoner of the Pinkies.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GIRL AND THE BOOLOOROO\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\n\nTrot watched from the window the escape of Ghip-Ghisizzle but did not\nknow, of course, who it was. Then, after the City had quieted down\nagain, she lay upon the bed without undressing and was sound asleep in\na minute.\n\nThe blue dawn was just breaking when she opened her eyes with a start\nof fear that she might have overslept, but soon she found that no one\nelse in the palace was yet astir. Even the guards had gone to sleep by\nthis time and were adding their snores to the snores of the other\ninhabitants of the Royal Palace. So the little girl got up and, finding\na ewer of water and a basin upon the dresser, washed herself carefully\nand then looked in a big mirror to see how her hair was. To her\nastonishment, there was no reflection at all; the mirror was blank so\nfar as Trot was concerned. She laughed a little at that, remembering\nshe wore the ring of Rosalie the Witch, which rendered her invisible.\nThen she slipped quietly out of the room and found it was already light\nenough in the corridors for her to see all objects distinctly.\n\nAfter hesitating a moment which way to turn, she decided to visit the\nSnubnosed Princesses and passed through the big reception room to the\nsleeping room of Indigo. There this Princess, the crossest and most\ndisagreeable of all the disagreeable six, was curled up in bed and\nslumbering cozily. The little blue dog came trotting out of Indigo's\nboudoir and crowed like a rooster, for although he could not see Trot,\nhis keen little nose scented her presence. Thinking it time the\nPrincess awoke, Trot leaned over and gave her snub nose a good tweak,\nand at once Indigo sprang out of her bed and rushed into the chamber of\nCobalt, which adjoined her own. Thinking it was this sister who had\nslyly attacked her, Indigo rushed at the sleeping Cobalt and slapped\nher face.\n\nAt once there was war. The other four Princesses, hearing the screams\nand cries of rage, came running into Cobalt's room, and as fast as they\nappeared, Trot threw pillows at them, so that presently all six were\nindulging in a free-for-all battle and snarling like tigers. The blue\nlamb came trotting into the room, and Trot leaned over and patted the\npretty little animal, but as she did so, she became visible for an\ninstant, each pat destroying the charm of the ring while the girl was\nin contact with a living creature. These flashes permitted some of the\nPrincesses to see her, and at once they rushed toward her with furious\ncries. But the girl realized what had happened, and leaving the lamb,\nshe stepped back into a corner and her frenzied enemies failed to find\nher. It was a little dangerous, though, remaining in a room where six\ngirls were feeling all around for her, so she went away and left them\nto their vain search while she renewed her hunt for Cap'n Bill.\n\nThe sailorman did not seem to be in any of the rooms she entered, so\nshe decided to visit the Boolooroo's own apartments. In the room where\nRosalie's vision had shown them the Magic Umbrella lying under a\ncabinet, Trot attempted to find it, for she considered that next to\nrescuing Cap'n Bill this was the most important task to accomplish; but\nthe umbrella had been taken away and was no longer beneath the cabinet.\nThis was a severe disappointment to the child, but she reflected that\nthe umbrella was surely someplace in the Blue city, so there was no\nneed to despair.\n\nFinally, she entered the King's own sleeping chamber and found the\nBoolooroo in bed and asleep, with a funny nightcap tied over his\negg-shaped head. As Trot looked at him, she was surprised to see that\nhe had one foot out of bed and that to his big toe was tied a cord that\nled out of the bedchamber into a small dressing room beyond. Trot\nslowly followed this cord and in the dressing room came upon Cap'n\nBill, who was lying asleep upon a lounge and snoring with great vigor.\nHis arms were tied to his body, and his body was tied fast to the\nlounge. The wooden leg stuck out into the room at an angle, and the\nshoe on his one foot had been removed so that the end of the cord could\nbe fastened to the sailor's big toe.\n\nThis arrangement had been a clever thought of the Boolooroo. Fearing\nhis important prisoner might escape before he was patched as\nGhip-Ghisizzle had done, the cruel King of the Blues had kept Cap'n\nBill in his private apartments and had tied his own big toe to the\nprisoner's big toe, so that if the sailor made any attempt to get away,\nhe would pull on the cord, and that would arouse the Boolooroo.\n\nTrot saw through this cunning scheme at once, so the first thing she\ndid was to untie the cord from Cap'n Bill's big toe and retie it to the\nleg of the lounge. Then she unfastened her friend's hands and leaned\nover to give his leathery face a smacking kiss. Cap'n Bill sat up and\nrubbed his eyes. He looked around the room and rubbed his eyes again,\nseeing no one who could have kissed him. Then he discovered that his\nbonds had been removed, and he rubbed his eyes once more to make sure\nhe was not dreaming. The little girl laughed softly.\n\n\"Trot!\" exclaimed the sailor, recognizing her voice.\n\nThen Trot came up and took his hand, the touch at once rendering her\nvisible to him. \"Dear me!\" said the bewildered sailor. \"However did you\nget here, mate, in the Boolooroo's own den? Is the Blue City captured?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" she replied, \"but YOU are, Cap'n, and I've come to save you.\"\n\n\"All alone, Trot?\"\n\n\"All alone, Cap'n Bill. But it's got to be done, jus' the same.\" And\nthen she explained about the magic ring Rosalie had lent her, which\nrendered her invisible while she wore it--unless she touched some\nliving creature. Cap'n Bill was much interested.\n\n\"I'm willing to be saved, mate,\" he said, \"for the Boolooroo is set on\npatchin' me right after breakfas', which I hope the cook'll be late\nwith.\"\n\n\"Who are you to be patched to?\" she asked.\n\n\"A feller named Tiggle, who's in disgrace 'cause he mixed the royal\nnecktie for me.\"\n\n\"That was nectar, not necktie,\" corrected Trot. \"But you needn't be\n'fraid of bein' patched with Tiggle, 'cause I've set him loose. By this\ntime he's in hiding, where he can't be found.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" said Cap'n Bill, nodding approval, \"but the blamed ol'\nBoolooroo's sure to find someone else. What's to be done, mate?\"\n\nTrot thought about it for a moment. Then she remembered how some\nunknown man had escaped from the palace the night before by means of\nthe wall, which he had reached from the window of the very chamber in\nwhich she had slept. Cap'n Bill might easily do the same. And the rope\nladder she had used would help the sailor down from the top of the\nwall. \"Could you climb down a rope ladder, Cap'n?\" she asked.\n\n\"Like enough,\" said he. \"I've done it many a time on shipboard.\"\n\n\"But you hadn't a wooden leg then,\" she reminded him.\n\n\"The wooden leg won't bother much,\" he assured her.\n\nSo Trot tied a small sofa cushion around the end of his wooden leg so\nit wouldn't make any noise pounding upon the floor, and then she\nquietly led the sailor through the room of the sleeping Boolooroo and\nthrough several other rooms until they came to the passage. Here a\nsoldier was on guard, but he had fallen asleep for a moment in order to\nrest himself. They passed the Blueskin without disturbing him and soon\nreached the chamber opposite the suite of the Six Snubnosed Princesses,\nwhom they could hear still quarreling loudly among themselves.\n\nTrot locked the door from the inside so no one could disturb them, and\nthen led the sailor to the window. The garden was just below.\n\n\"But good gracious me! It's a drop o' ten feet, Trot,\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"And you've only one foot to drop, Cap'n,\" she said, laughing.\n\"Couldn't you let yourself down with one of the sheets from the bed?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" he rejoined. \"But can YOU do that circus act, Trot?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm goin' to stay here an' find the Magic Umbrella,\" she replied.\n\"Bein' invis'ble, Cap'n, I'm safe enough. What I want to do is to see\nyou safe back with the Pinkies, an' then I'll manage to hold my own all\nright, never fear.\"\n\nSo they brought a blue sheet and tied one end to a post of the blue bed\nand let the other end dangle out the blue window. \"Goodbye, mate,\" said\nCap'n Bill, preparing to descend. \"Don't get reckless.\"\n\n\"I won't, Cap'n. Don't worry.\"\n\nThen he grasped the sheet with both hands and easily let himself down\nto the wall. Trot had told him where to find the rope ladder she had\nleft and how to fasten it to the broken flagstaff so he could climb\ndown into the field outside the City. As soon as he was safe on the\nwall, Cap'n Bill began to hobble along the broad top toward the\nconnecting wall that surrounded the entire City--just as Ghip-Ghisizzle\nhad done--and Trot anxiously watched him from the window.\n\nBut the Blue City was now beginning to waken to life. One of the\nsoldiers came from a house, sleepily yawning and stretching himself,\nand presently his eyes lit upon the huge form of Cap'n Bill hastening\nalong the top of the wall. The soldier gave a yell that aroused a score\nof his comrades and brought them tumbling into the street. When they\nsaw how the Boolooroo's precious prisoner was escaping, they instantly\nbecame alert and wide-awake, and every one started in pursuit along the\nfoot of the wall.\n\nOf course, the long-legged Blueskins could run faster than poor Cap'n\nBill. Some of them soon got ahead of the old sailorman and came to the\nrope ladder which Trot had left dangling from the stone bench, where it\nhung down inside the City. The Blue soldiers promptly mounted this\nladder and so gained the wall, heading off the fugitive. When Cap'n\nBill came up, panting and all out of breath, the Blueskins seized him\nand held him fast.\n\nCap'n Bill was terribly disappointed at being recaptured, and so was\nTrot, who had eagerly followed his every movement from her window in\nthe palace. The little girl would have cried with vexation, and I think\nshe did weep a few tears before she recovered her courage; but Cap'n\nBill was a philosopher, in his way, and had learned to accept ill\nfortune cheerfully. Knowing he was helpless, he made no protest when\nthey again bound him and carried him down the ladder like a bale of\ngoods.\n\nOthers were also disappointed by his capture. Button-Bright had heard\nthe parrot squawking, \"Oh, there's Cap'n Bill! There's Cap'n Bill! I\nsee him still, up on that hill! It's Cap'n Bill!\" So the boy ran out of\nhis tent to find the sailor scurrying along the top of the wall as fast\nas he could go. At once Button-Bright aroused Coralie, who got her\nPinkies together and quickly marched them toward the wall to assist in\nthe escape of her Commander in Chief. But they were too late. Before\nthey could reach the wall, the Blueskins had captured Trot's old friend\nand lugged him down in to the City, so Coralie and Button-Bright were\nforced to return to their camp discomfited. There Ghip-Ghisizzle and\nRosalie were awaiting them, and they all went into the Witch's tent and\nheld a council of war.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Ghip-Ghisizzle, \"did you not take the Royal Record Book\nfrom the Treasure Chamber of the Boolooroo?\"\n\n\"I did,\" replied the boy. \"I remember that you wanted it, and so I have\nkept it with me ever since that night. Here it is.\" And he presented\nthe little blue book to the Majordomo, the only friend the adventurers\nhad found among all the Blueskins.\n\nGhip-Ghisizzle took the book eagerly and at once began turning over its\nleaves. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed presently. \"It is just as I suspected. The\nwicked Boolooroo had already reigned over the Blue Country three\nhundred years last Thursday, so that now he has no right to rule at\nall. I myself have been the rightful Ruler of the Blues since Thursday,\nand yet this cruel and deceitful man has not only deprived me of my\nright to succeed him, but he has tried to have me patched so that I\ncould never become the Boolooroo.\"\n\n\"Does the book tell how old he is?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"Yes. He is not five hundred years old, and has yet another hundred\nyears to live. He planned to rule the Blue Country until the last, but\nI now know the deception he has practiced and have the Royal Record\nBook to prove it. With this I shall be able to force him to resign that\nI may take his place, for all the people will support me and abide by\nthe Law. The tyrant will perhaps fight me and my cause desperately, but\nI am sure to win in the end.\"\n\n\"If we can help you,\" said Button-Bright, \"the whole Pink Army will\nfight for you. Only, if you win, you must promise to give me back my\nMagic Umbrella and let us fly away to our own homes again.\"\n\n\"I will do that most willingly,\" agreed Ghip-Ghisizzle. \"And now let us\nconsult together how best to take the Blue City and capture the\nBoolooroo. As I know my own country much better than you or the Pinkies\ndo, I think I can find a way to accomplish our purpose.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE AMAZING CONQUEST OF THE BLUES\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\n\nThe shouting and excitement in the City following upon the recapture of\nCap'n Bill aroused the sleeping Boolooroo. He found the cord still tied\nto his big toe and at first imagined his prisoner safe in the dressing\nroom. While he put on his clothes, the king occasionally gave the cord\na sudden pull, hoping to hurt Cap'n Bill's big toe and make him yell;\nbut as no response came to this mean action, the Boolooroo finally\nlooked into the room only to find he had been pulling on a leg of the\ncouch and that his prisoner had escaped.\n\nThen he flew into a mighty rage, and running out into the hall he aimed\na blow at the unfaithful guard, knocking the fellow off his feet. Then\nhe rushed downstairs into the courtyard, shouting loudly for his\nsoldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the\nsailorman was not recaptured.\n\nWhile the Boolooroo stormed and raged, a band of soldiers and citizens\ncame marching in, surrounding Cap'n Bill, who was again firmly bound.\n\n\"So-ho!\" roared the monarch. \"You thought you could defy me, Earth\nClod, did you? But you were mistaken. No one can resist the Mighty\nBoolooroo of the Blues, so it is folly for you to rebel against my\ncommands. Hold him fast, my men, and as soon as I've had my coffee and\noatmeal I'll take him to the Room of the Great Knife and patch him.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't mind a cup o' coffee myself,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I've had\nconsid'ble exercise this mornin', and I'm all ready for breakfas'.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the Boolooroo, \"you shall eat with me, for then I\ncan keep an eye on you. My guards are not to be trusted, and I don't\nmean to let you out of my sight again until you are patched.\"\n\nSo Cap'n Bill and the Boolooroo had breakfast together, six Blueskins\nstanding in a row back of the sailorman to grab him if he attempted to\nescape. But Cap'n Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be\nuseless.\n\nTrot was in the room, too, standing in a corner and listening to all\nthat was said while she racked her little brain for an idea that would\nenable her to save Cap'n Bill from being patched. No one could see her,\nso no one--not even Cap'n Bill--knew she was there.\n\nAfter breakfast was over, a procession was formed, headed by the\nBoolooroo, and they marched the prisoner through the palace until they\ncame to the Room of the Great Knife. Invisible Trot followed soberly\nafter them, still wondering what she could do to save her friend.\n\nAs soon as they entered the Room of the great Knife, the Boolooroo gave\na yell of disappointment.\n\n\"What's become of Tiggle?\" he shouted. \"Where's Tiggle? Who has\nreleased Tiggle? Go at once, you dummies, and find him, or it will go\nhard with you!\"\n\nThe frightened soldiers hurried away to find Tiggle, and Trot was well\npleased because she knew Tiggle was by this time safely hidden.\n\nThe Boolooroo stamped up and down the room, muttering threats and\ndeclaring Cap'n Bill should be punished whether Tiggle was found or\nnot, and while they waited, Trot took time to make an inspection of the\nplace, which she now saw for the first time in broad daylight.\n\nThe Room of the Great Knife was high and big, and around it ran rows of\nbenches for the spectators to sit upon. In one place at the head of the\nroom was a raised platform for the royal family, with elegant\nthrone-chairs for the King and Queen and six smaller but richly\nupholstered chairs for the Snubnosed Princesses. The poor Queen, by the\nway, was seldom seen, as she passed all her time playing solitaire with\na deck that was one card short, hoping that before she had lived her\nentire six hundred years she would win the game. Therefore, her Majesty\npaid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her.\n\nIn the center of the room stood the terrible knife that gave the place\nits name, a name dreaded by every inhabitant of the Blue City. The\nknife was built into a huge framework like a derrick, that reached to\nthe ceiling, and it was so arranged that when the Boolooroo pulled a\ncord the great blade would drop down in its frame and neatly cut in two\nthe person who stood under it. And in order that the slicing would be\naccurate, there was another frame to which the prisoner was tied so\nthat he couldn't wiggle either way. This frame was on rollers so that\nit could be placed directly underneath the knife.\n\nWhile Trot was observing this dreadful machine, the door opened and in\nwalked the Six Snubnosed Princesses, all in a row and with their chins\nup as if they disdained everyone but themselves. They were\nmagnificently dressed, and their blue hair was carefully arranged in\nhuge towers upon their heads, with blue plumes stuck into the tops.\nThese plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the\nPrincesses took. Rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their\npersons, and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were\nhaughty and overbearing. They marched to their chairs and seated\nthemselves to enjoy the cruel scene their father was about to enact,\nand Cap'n Bill bowed to them politely and said:\n\n\"Mornin', girls. Hope ye feel as well as ye look.\"\n\n\"Papa,\" exclaimed Turquoise angrily, \"can you not prevent this vile\nEarth Being from addressing us? It is an insult to be spoken to by one\nabout to be patched.\"\n\n\"Control yourselves, my dears,\" replied the Boolooroo. \"The worst\npunishment I know how to inflict on anyone this prisoner is about to\nsuffer. You'll see a very pretty patching, my royal daughters.\"\n\n\"When?\" inquired Cobalt.\n\n\"When? As soon as the soldiers return with Tiggle,\" said he.\n\nBut just then in came the soldiers to say that Tiggle could not be\nfound anywhere in the City; he had disappeared as mysteriously as had\nGhip-Ghisizzle. Immediately, the Boolooroo flew into another towering\nrage.\n\n\"Villains!\" he shouted. \"Go out and arrest the first living thing you\nmeet, and whoever it proves to be will be instantly patched to Cap'n\nBill.\"\n\nThe Captain of the Guards hesitated to obey this order. \"Suppose it's a\nfriend?\" he suggested.\n\n\"Friend!\" roared the Boolooroo. \"I haven't a friend in the country.\nTell me, sir, do you know of anyone who is my friend?\"\n\nThe Captain shook his head. \"I can't think of anyone just now, your\nSpry and Flighty High and Mighty Majesty,\" he answered.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the Boolooroo. \"Everyone hates me, and I don't\nobject to that because I hate everybody. But I'm the Ruler here, and\nI'll do as I please. Go and capture the first living creature you see\nand bring him here to be patched to Cap'n Bill.\"\n\nSo the Captain took a file of soldiers and went away very sorrowful,\nfor he did not know who would be the victim, and if the Boolooroo had\nno friends, the Captain had plenty and did not wish to see them patched.\n\nMeanwhile, Trot, being invisible to all, was roaming around the room,\nand behind a bench she found a small end of rope, which she picked up.\nThen she seated herself in an out-of-the-way place and quietly waited.\n\nSuddenly there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling\nand struggling. Then the door flew open and in came the soldiers\ndragging a great blue billygoat, which was desperately striving to get\nfree.\n\n\"Villains!\" howled the Boolooroo. \"What does this mean?\"\n\n\"Why, you said to fetch the first living creature we met, and that was\nthis billygoat,\" replied the Captain, panting hard as he held fast to\none of the goat's horns.\n\nThe Boolooroo stared a moment, and then he fell back to his throne,\nlaughing boisterously. The idea of patching Cap'n Bill to a goat was\nvastly amusing to him, and the more he thought of it the more he roared\nwith laughter. Some of the soldiers laughed, too, being tickled with\nthe absurd notion, and the Six Snubnosed Princesses all sat up straight\nand permitted themselves to smile contemptuously. This would indeed be\na severe punishment, therefore the Princesses were pleased at the\nthought of Cap'n Bill's becoming half a billygoat, and the billygoat's\nbeing half Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"They look something alike, you know,\" suggested the Captain of the\nGuards, looking from one to the other doubtfully, \"and they're nearly\nthe same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs. They've both got\nthe same style of whiskers, and they're both of 'em obstinate and\ndangerous, so they ought to make a good patch.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Fine! Glorious!\" cried the Boolooroo, wiping the tears of\nmerriment from his eyes. \"We will proceed with the Ceremony of Patching\nat once.\"\n\nCap'n Bill regarded the billygoat with distinct disfavor, and the\nbillygoat glared evilly upon Cap'n Bill. Trot was horrified, and wrung\nher little hands in sore perplexity, for this was a most horrible fate\nthat awaited her dear friend.\n\n\"First, bind the Earth Man in the frame,\" commanded the Boolooroo.\n\"We'll slice him in two before we do the same to the billygoat.\"\n\nSo they seized Cap'n Bill and tied him into the frame so that he\ncouldn't move a jot in any direction. Then they rolled the frame\nunderneath the Great Knife and handed the Boolooroo the cord that\nreleased the blade. But while this was going on, Trot had crept up and\nfastened one end of her rope to the frame in which Cap'n Bill was\nconfined. Then she stood back and watched the Boolooroo, and just as he\npulled the cord, she pulled on her rope and dragged the frame on its\nrollers away, so that the Great Knife fell with a crash and sliced\nnothing but the air.\n\n\"Huh!\" exclaimed the Boolooroo. \"That's queer. Roll him up again,\nsoldiers.\"\n\nThe soldiers again rolled the frame in position, having first pulled\nthe Great Knife once more to the top of the derrick. The immense blade\nwas so heavy that it took the strength of seven Blueskins to raise it.\nWhen all was in readiness, the King pulled the cord a second time, and\nTrot at the same instant pulled upon her rope. The same thing happened\nas before. Cap'n Bill rolled away in his frame, and the knife fell\nharmlessly.\n\nNow, indeed, the Boolooroo was as angry as he was amazed. He jumped\ndown from the platform and commanded the soldiers to raise the Great\nKnife into position. When this was accomplished, the Boolooroo leaned\nover to try to discover why the frame rolled away--seemingly of its own\naccord--and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a\nthing before.\n\nAs he stood, bent nearly double, his back was toward the billygoat,\nwhich in their interest and excitement the soldiers were holding in a\ncareless manner. Before any could stop him, he butted his Majesty so\nfuriously that the King soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap\namong the benches, where he lay moaning and groaning.\n\nThe goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack. Finding\nhimself free, he turned and assaulted the soldiers, butting them so\nfiercely that they tumbled down in bunches, and as soon as they could\nrise again ran frantically from the room and along the corridors as if\na fiend was after them. By this time the goat was so animated by the\nspirit of conquest that he rushed at the Six Snubnosed Princesses, who\nhad all climbed upon their chairs and were screaming in a panic of\nfear. Six times the goat butted, and each time he tipped over a chair\nand sent a haughty Princess groveling upon the floor, where the ladies\ngot mixed up in their long, blue trains and flounces and laces and\nstruggled wildly until they recovered their footing. Then they sped in\ngreat haste for the door, and the goat gave a final butt that sent the\nrow of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle,\nwhereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within\nsound of their voices.\n\nAs the Room of the Great Knife was now cleared of all but Cap'n Bill,\nwho was tied in his frame, and of Trot and the moaning Boolooroo, who\nlay hidden behind the benches, the goat gave a victorious bleat and\nstood in the doorway to face any enemy that might appear. Trot had been\nas surprised as anyone at this sudden change of conditions, but she was\nquick to take advantage of the opportunities it afforded. First she ran\nwith her rope to the goat, and as the animal could not see her, she\neasily succeeded in tying the rope around its horns and fastening the\nloose end to a pillar of the doorway. Next she hurried to Cap'n Bill\nand began to unbind him, and as she touched the sailor she became\nvisible. He nodded cheerfully, then, and said, \"I had a notion it was\nyou, mate, as saved me from the knife. But it were a pretty close call,\nan' I hope it won't happen again. I couldn't shiver much, bein' bound\nso tight, but when I'm loose I mean to have jus' one good shiver to\nrelieve my feelin's.\"\n\n\"Shiver all you want to, Cap'n,\" she said as she removed the last\nbonds. \"But first you've got to help me save us both.\"\n\n\"As how?\" he asked, stepping from the frame.\n\n\"Come and get the Boolooroo,\" she said, going toward the benches. The\nsailor followed and pulled out the Boolooroo, who, when he saw the\nterrible goat was captured and tied fast, quickly recovered his\ncourage. \"Hi, there!\" he cried. \"Where are my soldiers? What do you\nmean, prisoner, by daring to lay hands upon me? Let me go this minute\nor I'll--I'll have you patched TWICE!\"\n\n\"Don't mind him, Cap'n,\" said Trot, \"but fetch him along to the frame.\"\nThe Boolooroo looked around to see where the voice came from, and Cap'n\nBill grinned joyfully and caught up the king in both his strong arms,\ndragging the struggling Monarch of the Blues to the frame.\n\n\"Stop it! How dare you?\" roared the frightened Boolooroo. \"I'll have\nrevenge! I'll--I'll--\"\n\n\"You'll take it easy, 'cause you can't help yourself,\" said Cap'n Bill.\n\"What next, Queen Trot?\"\n\n\"Hold him steady in the frame, and I'll tie him up,\" she replied. So\nCap'n Bill held the Boolooroo, and the girl tied him fast in position\nas Cap'n Bill had been tied, so that his Majesty couldn't wiggle at\nall. Then they rolled the frame in position underneath the Great Knife\nand Trot held in her hand the cord which would release it.\n\n\"All right, Cap'n,\" she said in a satisfied tone. \"I guess we can run\nthis Blue Country ourselves after this.\" The Boolooroo was terrified to\nfind himself in danger of being sliced by the same knife he had so\noften wickedly employed to slice others. Like Cap'n Bill, he had no\nroom to shiver, but he groaned very dismally and was so full of fear\nthat his blue hair nearly stood on end.\n\n\n\n\nTHE RULER OF SKY ISLAND\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\n\nThe girl now took off Rosalie's ring and put it carefully away in her\npocket. \"It won't matter who sees me now,\" she remarked, \"an' I want\n'em to know that you an' me, Cap'n, are running this kingdom. I'm Queen\no' the Pinkies an' Booloorooess o' the Blues, an'--\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked the sailor. \"You're--you're WHAT, Trot?\"\n\n\"Booloorooess. Isn't that right, Cap'n?\"\n\n\"I dunno, mate. It sounds bigger ner you are, an' I don't like the\nword, anyhow. S'pose you jus' call yourself the Boss? That fills the\nbill an' don't need pernouncin'.\"\n\n\"All right,\" she said. \"Queen o' the Pinkies an' Boss o' the Blues.\nSeems funny, don't it, Cap'n Bill?\"\n\nJust then they heard a sound of footsteps in the corridor. The soldiers\nhad recovered their courage, and fearful of the anger of their dreaded\nBoolooroo, whom the Princesses declared would punish them severely, had\nventured to return to the room. They came rather haltingly, though, and\nthe Captain of the Guards first put his head cautiously through the\ndoorway to see if the coast was clear. The goat discovered him and\ntried to make a rush, but the rope held the animal back, and when the\nCaptain saw this, he came forward more boldly.\n\n\"Halt!\" cried Trot. The Captain halted, his soldiers peering curiously\nover his shoulders and the Six Snubnosed Princesses looking on from\nbehind, where they considered themselves safe. \"If anyone dares enter\nthis room without my permission,\" said Trot, \"I'll pull this cord and\nslice your master that once was the Boolooroo.\"\n\n\"Don't come in! Don't come in!\" yelled the Boolooroo in a terrified\nvoice.\n\nThen they saw that the sailor was free and the Boolooroo bound in his\nplace. The soldiers were secretly glad to observe this, but the\nPrincesses were highly indignant. \"Release his Majesty at once!\" cried\nIndigo from the corridor. \"You shall be severely punished for this\nrebellion.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" replied Trot. \"His Majesty isn't his Majesty any longer.\nHe's jus' a common Blueskin. Cap'n Bill and I perpose runnin' this\nIsland ourselves, after this. You've all got to obey ME, for I'm the\nBooloorooess--no, I mean the Boss--o' the Blues, and I've a notion to\nrun things my own way.\"\n\n\"You can't,\" said Turquoise scornfully. \"The Law says--\"\n\n\"Bother the Law!\" exclaimed Trot. \"I'll make the Laws myself from now\non, and I'll unmake every Law you ever had before I conquered you.\"\n\n\"Oh, have you conquered us, then?\" asked the Captain of the Guards in a\nsurprised tone.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Trot. \"Can't you see?\"\n\n\"It looks like it,\" admitted the Captain.\n\n\"Cap'n Bill is goin' to be my General o' the Army an' the Royal Manager\no' the Blue Country,\" continued Trot, \"so you'll mind what he says.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" shouted Indigo. \"March in and capture them, Captain! Never\nmind if they do slice the Boolooroo. I'm his daughter, and I'LL rule\nthe kingdom.\"\n\n\"You won't!\" screamed Cobalt. \"I'll rule it!\"\n\n\"I'll rule it myself!\" cried Cerulia.\n\n\"No, no!\" yelled Turquoise. \"I'll be the Ruler.\"\n\n\"That shall be MY privilege!\" shouted Sapphire. Cobalt began to say,\n\"I'm the--\"\n\n\"Be quiet!\" said Trot sternly. \"Would you have your own father sliced\nso that you could rule in his place?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course!\" rejoined the six Princesses without a second's\nhesitation.\n\n\"Well, well! What d' ye think o' that, Mr. Boolooroo?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"They're undutiful daughters. Don't pay any attention to them,\" replied\nthe frightened Boolooroo.\n\n\"We're not goin' to,\" said Trot. \"Now, you Blue Cap'n, who are you and\nyour soldiers going to obey, me or the snubnosed ones?\"\n\n\"You!\" declared the Captain of the Guards positively, for he hated the\nPrincesses, as did all the Blueskins.\n\n\"Then escort those girls to their rooms, lock 'em in, an' put a guard\nbefore the door.\"\n\nAt once the soldiers seized the Princesses and notwithstanding their\nsnarls and struggles marched them to their rooms and locked them in.\nWhile they were gone on this errand, the Boolooroo begged to be\nreleased, whining and wailing for fear the knife would fall upon him.\nBut Trot did not think it safe to unbind him just then. When the\nsoldiers returned, she told their leader to put a strong guard before\nthe palace and to admit no one unless either she or Cap'n Bill gave the\norder to do so. The soldiers obeyed readily, and when Trot and Cap'n\nBill were left alone, they turned the goat loose in the Room of the\nGreat Knife and then locked the animal in with the Boolooroo.\n\n\"The billygoat is the very best guard we could have, for ever'body's\n'fraid o' him,\" remarked Cap'n Bill as he put the key of the room in\nhis pocket. \"So now, Queen Trot, what's next on the program?\"\n\n\"Next,\" said Trot, \"we're goin' to hunt for that umbrel, Cap'n. I don't\nmean to stay in this dismal Blue Country long, even if I am the Queen.\nLet's find the umbrel and go home as soon as we can.\"\n\n\"That suits me,\" the sailor joyfully exclaimed, and then the two began\na careful search through the palace. They went into every room and\nlooked behind the furniture and underneath the beds and in every crack\nand corner, but no place could they spy the Magic Umbrella. Cap'n Bill\neven ventured to enter the rooms of the Six Snubnosed Princesses, who\nwere by this time so thoroughly alarmed that they had become meek and\nmild as could be. But the umbrella wasn't there, either.\n\nFinally, they returned to the great throne room of the palace, where\nthey seated themselves on the throne and tried to think what could\npossibly have become of the precious umbrella. While they were sitting\nand talking together, the Captain of the Guards entered and bowed\nrespectfully. \"Beg pardon, your Small-Sized Majesty,\" said he to Trot,\n\"but it is my duty to report that the Pinkies are preparing to attack\nthe City.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'd forgotten the Pinkies!\" exclaimed the girl. \"Tell me, Captain,\nhave you such a thing as a Brass Band in this City?\"\n\n\"We have two fine bands, but they are not brass,\" replied the Captain.\n\"Their instruments are made of blue metal.\"\n\n\"Well, order 'em out,\" commanded Trot. \"And say, get all the soldiers\ntogether and tell all the people there's going to be a high time in the\nBlue City tonight. We'll have music and dancing and eating and--\"\n\n\"An' neckties to drink, Trot. Don't forget the royal neckties,\" urged\nCap'n Bill.\n\n\"We'll have all the fun there is going,\" continued the girl, \"for we\nare to entertain the Army of the Pinkies.\"\n\n\"The Pinkies!\" exclaimed the Captain of the Guards. \"Why, they're our\nenemies, your Short Highness.\"\n\n\"Not any more,\" replied Trot. \"I'm Queen of the Pinkies, an' I'm also\nQueen of the Blues, so I won't have my people quarreling. Tell the Blue\npeople we are to throw open the gates and welcome the Pinkies to the\nCity, where everybody will join in a grand celebration. And jus' as\nsoon as you've spread the news an' got the bands tuned up and the\nsoldiers ready to march, you let us know, and we'll head the\nprocession.\"\n\n\"Your Microscopic Majesty shall be obeyed,\" said the Captain, and went\naway to carry out these commands.\n\n\n\n\nTROT CELEBRATES THE VICTORY\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\n\nThe Blue people were by this time dazed with wonder at all the events\nthat had transpired that eventful day, but they still had wit enough to\nbe glad the war was over, for in war someone is likely to get hurt, and\nit is foolish to take such chances when one can remain quietly at home.\nThe Blues did not especially admire the Pinkies, but it was easier to\nentertain them than to fight them, and above all, the Blueskins were\ngreatly rejoiced that their wicked Boolooroo had been conquered and\ncould no longer abuse them. So they were quite willing to obey the\norders of their girl Queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets\nand roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told Trot and Cap'n Bill that\nthe Blue Bands had assembled before the palace.\n\nSo they went down and found that a great crowd of people had gathered,\nand these cheered Trot with much enthusiasm--which was very different\nfrom the scowls and surly looks with which they had formerly greeted\ntheir strange visitors from the Earth.\n\nThe soldiers wore their best blue uniforms and were formed before the\npalace in marching order, so Trot and Cap'n Bill headed the procession,\nand then came the soldiers--all keeping step--and then the bands,\nplaying very loud noises on their instruments, and finally the crowd of\nBlue citizens waving flags and banners and shouting joyfully. In this\norder they proceeded to the main gate, which Trot ordered the guards to\nthrow wide open. Then they all marched out a little way into the fields\nand found that the Army of Pinkies had already formed and was advancing\nsteadily toward them.\n\nAt the head of the Pinkies were Ghip-Ghisizzle and Button-Bright, who\nhad the parrot on his shoulder, and they were supported by Captain\nCoralie and Captain Tintint and Rosalie the Witch. They had decided to\ncapture the Blue City at all hazards, that they might rescue Trot and\nCap'n Bill and conquer the Boolooroo, so when from a distance they saw\nthe Blueskins march from the gate with banners flying and bands\nplaying, they supposed a most terrible fight was about to take place.\n\nHowever, as the two forces came nearer together, Button-Bright spied\nTrot and Cap'n Bill standing before the enemy, and the sight astonished\nhim considerably.\n\n\"Welcome, friends!\" shouted Cap'n Bill in a loud voice; and \"Welcome!\"\ncried Trot; and \"Welcome!\" roared the Blue soldiers and the people of\nthe Blue City.\n\n\"Hooray!\" yelled the parrot,\n\n  \"Welcome to our happy home\n  From which no longer will we roam!\"\n\nAnd then he flapped his wings and barked like a dog with pure delight,\nand added as fast as his bird's tongue could speak,\n\n  \"One army's pink and one is blue,\n  But neither one is in a stew\n  Because the naughty Boolooroo\n  Is out of sight, so what we'll do\n  Is try to be a jolly crew\n  And dance and sing our too-ral-loo\n  And to our friends be ever true\n  And to our foes--\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" said Button-Bright, \"I can't hear myself think.\"\n\nThe Pinkies were amazed at the strange reception of the Blues and\nhesitated to advance, but Trot now ran up in front of them and made a\nlittle speech. \"Pinkies,\" said she, \"your Queen has conquered the\nBoolooroo and is now the Queen of the Blues. All of Sky Island except\nthe Fog Bank is now my kingdom, so I welcome my faithful Pinkies to my\nBlue City, where you are to be royally entertained and have a good\ntime. The war is over an' ever'body must be sociable an' happy or I'll\nknow the reason why!\"\n\nNow, indeed, the Pinkies raised a great shout of joy, and the Blues\nresponded with another joyful shout, and Rosalie kissed the little girl\nand said she had performed wonders, and everybody shook hands with\nCap'n Bill and congratulated him upon his escape, and the parrot flew\nto Trot's shoulder and screeched,\n\n  \"The Pinkies are pink, the Blues are blue,\n  But Trot's the Queen, so too-ral-loo!\"\n\nWhen the Blueskins saw Ghip-Ghisizzle, they raised another great shout,\nfor he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the\npeople. But Ghip-Ghisizzle did not heed the shouting. He was looking\ndowncast and sad, and it was easy to see he was disappointed because he\nhad not conquered the Boolooroo himself. But the people called upon him\nfor a speech, so he faced the Blueskins and said, \"I escaped from the\nCity because the Boolooroo tried to patch me as you all know, and the\nSix Snubnosed Princesses tried to marry me, which would have been a far\ngreater misfortune. But I have recovered the Book of Royal Records,\nwhich has long been hidden in the Treasure Chamber, and by reading it I\nfind that the Boolooroo is not your lawful Boolooroo at all, having\nreigned more than his three hundred years. Since last Thursday, I,\nGhip-Ghisizzle, have been the lawful Boolooroo of the Blue Country, but\nnow that you are conquered by Queen Trot, I suppose I am conquered,\ntoo, and you have no Boolooroo at all.\"\n\n\"Hooray!\" cried the parrot.\n\n  \"Here's a pretty howdy-do--\n  You haven't any Boolooroo!\"\n\nTrot had listened carefully to the Majordomo's speech. When he\nfinished, she said cheerfully, \"Don't worry, Sizzle dear, it'll all\ncome right pretty soon. Now then, let's enter the City an' enjoy the\ngrand feast that's being cooked. I'm nearly starved, myself, for this\nconquerin' kingdoms is hard work.\"\n\nSo the Pinkies and the Blues marched side by side into the City, and\nthere was great rejoicing and music and dancing and feasting and games\nand merrymaking that lasted for three full days. Trot carried Rosalie\nand Captain Coralie and Ghip-Ghisizzle to the palace, and of course\nButton-Bright and Cap'n Bill were with her. They had the Royal chef\nserve dinner at once, and they ate in great state, seated in the Royal\nBanquet Hall, where they were waited on by a hundred servants. The\nparrot perched upon the back of Queen Trot's chair, and the girl fed it\nherself, being glad to have the jolly bird with her again.\n\nAfter they had eaten all they could and the servants had been sent\naway, Trot related her adventures, telling how with the assistance of\nthe billygoat she had turned the tables on the wicked Boolooroo. Then\nshe gave Rosalie back her magic ring, thanking the kind Witch for all\nshe had done for them. \"And now,\" said she, \"I want to say to\nGhip-'Sizzle that jus' as soon as we can find Button-Bright's umbrel\nwe're going to fly home again. I'll always be Queen of Sky Island, but\nthe Pink and Blue Countries must each have a Ruler. I think I'll make\n'Sizzle the Boolooroo of the Blues, but I want you to promise me, Ghip,\nthat you'll destroy the Great Knife and its frame and clean up the room\nand turn it into a skating rink an' never patch anyone as long as you\nrule the Blueskins.\"\n\nGhip-Ghisizzle was overjoyed at the prospect of being Boolooroo of the\nBlues, but he looked solemn at the promise Trot exacted. \"I'm not\ncruel,\" he said, \"and I don't approve of patching in general, so I'll\nwillingly destroy the Great Knife. But before I do that, I want the\nprivilege of patching the Snubnosed Princesses to each other--mixing\nthe six as much as possible--and then I want to patch the former\nBoolooroo to the billygoat, which is the same punishment he was going\nto inflict upon Cap'n Bill.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Trot positively. \"There's been enough patching in this\ncountry, and I won't have any more of it. The old Boolooroo and the six\nstuck-up Princesses will be punished enough by being put out of the\npalace. The people don't like 'em a bit, so they'll be outcasts and\nwanderers, and that will make 'em sorry they were so wicked an' cruel\nwhen they were powerful. Am I right, Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"You are, mate,\" replied the sailor.\n\n\"Please, Queen Trot,\" begged Ghip-Ghisizzle, \"let me patch just the\nBoolooroo. It will be such a satisfaction.\"\n\n\"I have said no, an' I mean it,\" answered the girl. \"You let the poor\nold Boolooroo alone. There's nothing that hurts so much as a come-down\nin life, an' I 'spect the old rascal's goin' to be pretty miser'ble\nby'm'by.\"\n\n\"What does he say to his reversal of fortune?\" asked Rosalie.\n\n\"Why, I don't b'lieve he knows about it,\" said Trot. \"Guess I'd better\nsend for him an' tell him what's happened.\"\n\nSo the Captain of the Guards was given the key and told to fetch the\nBoolooroo from the Room of the Great Knife. The guards had a terrible\nstruggle with the goat, which was loose in the room and still wanted to\nfight, but finally they subdued the animal, and then they took the\nBoolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the\ngoat before Queen Trot, who awaited them in the throne room of the\npalace. When the courtiers and the people assembled saw the goat, they\ngave a great cheer, for the beast had helped to dethrone their wicked\nRuler.\n\n\"What's goin' to happen to this tough ol' warrior, Trot?\" asked Cap'n\nBill. \"It's my idee as he's braver than the whole Blue Army put\ntogether.\"\n\n\"You're right, Cap'n,\" she returned. \"I'll have 'Sizzle make a fine\nyard for the goat, where he'll have plenty of blue grass to eat. An'\nI'll have a pretty fence put around it an' make all the people honor\nan' respec' him jus' as long as he lives.\"\n\n\"I'll gladly do that,\" promised the new Boolooroo, \"and I'll feed the\nhonorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat,\nbesides the grass. He'll be the happiest goat in Sky Island, I assure\nyou.\"\n\nAs they led the now-famous animal from the room, the Boolooroo\nshuddered and said, \"How dare you people give orders in my palace? I'm\nthe Boolooroo!\"\n\n\"'Scuse me,\" said Trot. \"I neglected to tell you that you're not the\nBoolooroo any more. We've got the Royal Record Book, an' it proves\nyou've already ruled this country longer than you had any right to.\n'Sides all that, I'm the Queen o' Sky Island--which means Queen o' the\nPinkies an' Queen o' the Blues, both of 'em. So things are run as I\nsay, an' I've made Ghip-Ghisizzle Boolooroo in your place. He'll look\nafter this end of the Island hereafter, an' unless I'm much mistaken,\nhe'll do it a heap better than you did.\"\n\nThe former Boolooroo groaned. \"What's going to become of me, then?\" he\nasked. \"Am I to be patched, or what?\"\n\n\"You won't be hurt,\" answered the girl, \"but you'll have to find some\nother place to stay besides this palace, an' perhaps you'll enjoy\nworkin' for a livin' by way of variety.\"\n\n\"Can't I take any of the treasure with me?\" he pleaded.\n\n\"Not even a bird cage,\" said she. \"Ever'thing in the palace now belongs\nto Ghip-Ghisizzle.\"\n\n\"Except the Six Snubnosed Princesses,\" exclaimed the new Boolooroo\nearnestly. \"Won't you please get rid of them, too, your Majesty? Can't\nthey be discharged?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Trot. \"They must go with their dear father an'\nmother. Isn't there some house in the City they can all live in, Ghip?\"\n\n\"Why, I own a little cabin at the end of the town,\" said\nGhip-Ghisizzle, \"and I'll let them use that, as I won't need it any\nlonger. It isn't a very pretty cabin, and the furniture is cheap and\ncommon, but I'm sure it is good enough for this wicked man and his\nfamily.\"\n\n\"I'll not be wicked any more,\" sighed the old Boolooroo. \"I'll reform.\nIt's always best to reform when it is no longer safe to remain wicked.\nAs a private citizen, I shall be a model of deportment, because it\nwould be dangerous to be otherwise.\"\n\nTrot now sent for the Princesses, who had been weeping and wailing and\nfighting among themselves ever since they learned that their father had\nbeen conquered. When first they entered the throne room, they tried to\nbe as haughty and scornful as ever, but the Blues who were assembled\nthere all laughed at them and jeered them, for there was not a single\nperson in all the Blue Country who loved the Princesses the least\nlittle bit.\n\nTrot told the girls that they must go with their father to live in\nGhip-Ghisizzle's little old cabin, and when they heard this dreadful\ndecree, the six snubnosed ones began to scream and have hysterics, and\nbetween them they managed to make so much noise that no one could hear\nanything else. So Ghip-Ghisizzle ordered the Captain to take a file of\nsoldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home.\n\nThis was done, the once-royal family departing from the palace with\nshamed and downcast looks. Then the Room of the Great Knife was cleared\nof its awful furniture. The frames were split into small pieces of\nbluewood and the benches chopped into kindling and the immense sharp\nknife broken into bits. All the rubbish was piled into the square\nbefore the palace and a bonfire made of it, while the Blue people\nclustered around and danced and sang with joy as the blue flames\ndevoured the dreadful instrument that had once caused them so much\nunhappiness.\n\nThat evening Trot gave a grand ball in her palace, to which the most\nimportant of the Pinkies and the Blueskins were invited. The combined\nbands of both the countries played the music, and a fine supper was\nserved. The Pinkies would not dance with the Blues, however, nor would\nthe Blues dance with the Pinkies. The two nations were so different in\nall ways that they were unable to agree at all, and several times\nduring the evening quarrels arose and there was fighting between them,\nwhich Trot promptly checked.\n\n\"I think it would be best for us to go back to our own country as soon\nas possible,\" suggested Rosalie the Witch, \"for if we stay here very\nlong, the Blueskins may rise against us and cause the Pinkies much\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Jus' as soon as we find that umbrel,\" promised Trot, \"we'll dive into\nthe Fog Bank an' make tracks for the Land of Sunrise an' Sunset.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FATE OF THE MAGIC UMBRELLA\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\n\nNext morning the search for the Magic Umbrella began in earnest. With\nmany to hunt for it and the liberty of the whole palace to aid them,\nevery inch of the great building was carefully examined. But no trace\nof the umbrella could be found. Cap'n Bill and Button-Bright went down\nto the cabin of the former Boolooroo and tried to find out what he had\ndone with the umbrella, but the old Boolooroo said,\n\n\"I had it brought from the Treasure Chamber and tried to make it work,\nbut there was no magic about the thing. So I threw it away. I haven't\nany idea what became of it.\"\n\nThe six former Princesses were sitting upon a rude bench, looking quite\nbedraggled and untidy. Said Indigo:\n\n\"If you will make Ghip-Ghisizzle marry me, I'll find your old umbrella.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" asked Button-Bright eagerly.\n\n\"Make Ghip-Ghisizzle marry me, and I'll tell you,\" repeated Indigo.\n\"But I won't say another word about it until after I am married.\"\n\nSo they went back to the palace and proposed to the new Boolooroo to\nmarry Indigo so they could get their Magic Umbrella. But Ghip-Ghisizzle\npositively refused.\n\n\"I'd like to help you,\" said he, \"but nothing will ever induce me to\nmarry one of those snubnoses.\"\n\n\"They're very pretty--for Blueskins,\" said Trot.\n\n\"But when you marry a girl, you marry the inside as well as the\noutside,\" declared Ghip-Ghisizzle, \"and inside these Princesses there\nare wicked hearts and evil thoughts. I'd rather be patched than marry\nthe best of them.\"\n\n\"Which IS the best?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"I don't know, I'm sure,\" was the reply. \"Judging from their actions in\nthe past, there is no best.\"\n\nRosalie the Witch now went to the cabin and put Indigo into a deep\nsleep by means of a powerful charm. Then, while the Princess slept, the\nWitch made her tell all she knew, which wasn't a great deal, to be\nsure; but it was soon discovered that Indigo had been deceiving them\nand knew nothing at all about the umbrella. She had hoped to marry\nGhip-Ghisizzle and become Queen, after which she could afford to laugh\nat their reproaches. So the Witch woke her up and went back to the\npalace to tell Trot of her failure.\n\nThe girl and Button-bright and Cap'n Bill were all rather discouraged\nby this time, for they had searched high and low and had not found a\ntrace of the all-important umbrella. That night none of them slept\nmuch, for they all lay awake wondering how they could ever return to\nthe Earth and to their homes.\n\nIn the morning of the third day after Trot's conquest of the Blues, the\nlittle girl conceived another idea. She called all the servants of the\npalace to her and questioned them closely. But not one could remember\nhaving seen anything that looked like an umbrella.\n\n\"Are all the servants of the old Boolooroo here?\" inquired Cap'n Bill,\nwho was sorry to see Trot looking so sad and downcast.\n\n\"All but one,\" was the reply. \"Tiggle used to be a servant, but he\nescaped and ran away.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed Trot. \"Tiggle is in hiding somewhere. Perhaps he\ndoesn't know there's been a revolution and a new Boolooroo rules the\ncountry. If he did, there's no need for him to hide any longer, for he\nis now in no danger.\"\n\nShe now dispatched messengers all through the City and the surrounding\ncountry, who cried aloud for Tiggle, saying that the new Boolooroo\nwanted him. Tiggle, hiding in the cellar of a deserted house in a back\nstreet, at last heard these cries and joyfully came forth to confront\nthe messengers. Having heard of the old Boolooroo's downfall and\ndisgrace, the old man consented to go to the palace again, and as soon\nas Trot saw him she asked about the umbrella.\n\nTiggle thought hard for a minute and then said he remembered sweeping\nthe King's rooms and finding a queer thing--that might have been an\numbrella--lying beneath a cabinet. It had ropes and two wooden seats\nand a wicker basket all attached to the handle.\n\n\"That's it!\" cried Button-Bright excitedly, and \"That's it! That's it!\"\ncried both Trot and Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"But what did you do with it?\" asked Ghip-Ghisizzle.\n\n\"I dragged it out and threw it on the rubbish heap in an alley back of\nthe palace,\" said Tiggle. At once they all rushed out to the alley and\nbegan digging in the rubbish heap. By and by Cap'n Bill uncovered the\nlunch basket, and pulling on this he soon drew up the two seats, and\nfinally the Magic Umbrella.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Button-Bright, grabbing the umbrella and hugging it\ntight in his arms.\n\n\"Hooray!\" shrieked the parrot.\n\n  \"Cap'n Bill's a lucky fellah,\n  'Cause he found the old umbrella!\"\n\nTrot's face was wreathed in smiles. \"This is jus' the best luck that\ncould have happened to us,\" she exclaimed, \"'cause now we can go home\nwhenever we please.\"\n\n\"Let's go now--this minute--before we lose the umbrella again,\" said\nButton-Bright.\n\nBut Trot shook her head. \"Not yet,\" she replied. \"We've got to\nstraighten out things in Sky Island first of all. A Queen has some\nduties, you know, and as long as I'm Queen here, I've got to live up to\nthe part.\"\n\n\"What has to be did, mate?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Well, we've fixed the Blue Country pretty well by makin' 'Sizzle the\nBoolooroo of it; but the Pinkies mus' be looked after, too, 'cause\nthey've stood by us an' helped us to win. We must take 'em home again\nsafe an' sound and get a new Queen to rule over 'em. When that's done,\nwe can go home any time we want to.\"\n\n\"Quite right, Trot,\" said the sailor approvingly. \"When do we march?\"\n\n\"Right away,\" she replied. \"I've had enough of the Blue Country,\nhaven't you?\"\n\n\"We have, mate.\"\n\n\"We've had plenty of it,\" observed Button-Bright.\n\n\"And the Pinkies are anxious to get home,\" added Rosalie, who was\npresent.\n\nSo Cap'n Bill unhooked the seats from the handle of the umbrella and\nwound the ropes around the two boards and made a package of them, which\nhe carried under his arm. Trot took the empty lunch basket, and\nButton-Bright held fast to the precious umbrella. Then they returned to\nthe palace to bid goodbye to Ghip-Ghisizzle and the Blues.\n\nThe new Boolooroo seemed rather sorry to lose his friends, but the\npeople were secretly glad to get rid of the strangers, especially of\nthe Pinkies. They maintained a sullen silence while Coralie and Captain\nTintint formed their ranks in marching order, and they did not even\ncheer when Trot said to them in a final speech:\n\n\"I'm the Queen of Sky Island, you know, and the new Boolooroo has to\ncarry out my orders and treat you all nicely while I'm away. I don't\nknow when I'll come back, but you'd better watch out an' not make any\ntrouble, or I'll find a way to make you sorry for it. So now, goodbye!\"\n\n\"And good riddance!\" screamed the Six Snubnosed Girls who had once been\nPrincesses and who were now in the crowd that watched the departure.\n\nBut Trot paid no attention to them. She made a signal to the Pinkie\nBand, which struck up a fine Pink March, and then the Army stepped out\nwith the left foot first, and away went the conquerors down the streets\nof the Blue City, out of the blue-barred gateway and across the country\ntoward the Fog Bank.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ELEPHANT'S HEAD COMES TO LIFE\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\n\nWhen they reached the edge of the Fog Bank, the Pinkies all halted to\nput on their raincoats, and Button-Bright put up his umbrella and held\nit over himself and Trot. Then, when everybody was ready, they entered\nthe Fog and Rosalie the Witch made a signal to call the Frog King and\nhis subjects to aid them as they had done before.\n\nPretty soon the great frogs appeared, a long line of them facing Trot\nand her Pink Army and sitting upon their haunches close together.\n\n\"Turn around so we can get upon your backs,\" said Rosalie.\n\n\"Not yet,\" answered the Frog King in a gruff, deep voice. \"You must\nfirst take that insulting umbrella out of my dominions.\"\n\n\"Why, what is there about my umbrella that seems insulting?\" asked\nButton-Bright in surprise.\n\n\"It is an intimation that you don't like our glorious climate and\nobject to our delightful fog and are trying to ward off its soulful,\nclinging kisses,\" replied the Frog King in an agitated voice. \"There\nhas never been an umbrella in my kingdom before, and I'll not allow one\nin it now. Take it away at once!\"\n\n\"But we can't,\" explained Trot. \"We've got to take the umbrella with us\nto the Pink Country. We'll put it down if you like, an' cross the bank\nin this drizzle--which may be clingin' an' soulful, but is too wet to\nbe comfort'ble. But the umbrella's got to go with us.\"\n\n\"It can't go another inch,\" cried the obstinate frog with an angry\ncroak, \"nor shall any of your people advance another step while that\ninsulting umbrella is with you.\"\n\nTrot turned to Rosalie. \"What shall we do?\" she asked.\n\n\"I really do not know,\" replied the Witch, greatly perplexed.\n\n\"Can't you MAKE the frogs let us through?\" inquired the boy.\n\n\"No, I have no power over the frogs,\" Rosalie answered. \"They carried\nus before as a favor, but if the king now insists that we cannot pass\nwith the umbrella, we must go back to the Blue Country or leave your\numbrella behind us.\"\n\n\"We won't do that!\" said Button-Bright indignantly. \"Can't we fight the\nfrogs?\"\n\n\"Fight!\" cried Trot. \"Why, see how big they are. They could eat up our\nwhole army if they wanted to.\"\n\nBut just then, while they stood dismayed at this unfortunate position,\na queer thing happened. The umbrella in Button-Bright's hand began to\ntremble and shake. He looked down at the handle and saw that the red\neyes of the carved elephant's head were rolling fiercely and sending\nout red sparks of anger in all directions. The trunk swayed from side\nto side, and the entire head began to swell and grow larger.\n\nIn his fright, the boy sprang backward a step and dropped the umbrella\nto the ground, and as he did so, it took the form of a complete\nelephant, growing rapidly to a monstrous size. Then, flapping its ears\nand wagging its tail--which was merely the covered frame of the\numbrella--the huge elephant lifted its trunk and charged the line of\nastonished frogs.\n\nIn a twinkling the frogs all turned and made the longest leaps their\npowerful legs enabled them to. The King jumped first of all, and in a\npanic of fear the others followed his example. They were out of sight\nin an instant, and then the elephant turned its head and looked at\nButton-Bright and at once trotted into the depths of the fog.\n\n\"He wants us to follow,\" said the boy, gasping in amazement at this\nwonderful transformation. So immediately they began marching through\nthe fog behind the elephant, and as the great beast advanced the frogs\nscrambled out of his way and hid themselves in the moist banks until he\nhad passed them by.\n\nCap'n Bill had to mind his wooden leg carefully, and the old sailor was\nso excited that he mumbled queer sentences about \"Araby Ann Knights\"\nand \"ding-donged magic\" and the \"fool foolishness of fussin' with\nwitches an' sich,\" until Trot wondered whether her old friend had gone\ncrazy or was only badly scared.\n\nIt was a long journey, and all the Pinkies were dripping water from\ntheir raincoats, and their fat little legs were tired and aching when\nthe pink glow showing through the fog at last announced that they were\nnearing the Pink Country.\n\nAt the very edge of the Fog Bank the elephant halted, winked at\nButton-Bright, lowered its head and began to shrink in size and dwindle\naway. By the time the boy came up to it, closely followed by Trot and\nCap'n Bill, the thing was only the well-known Magic Umbrella, with the\ncarved elephant's head for a handle, and it lay motionless upon the\nground. Button-Bright picked it up, and as he examined it he thought\nthe tiny eyes still twinkled a little, as if with triumph and pride.\n\nTrot drew a long breath.\n\n\"That was SOME magic, I guess!\" she exclaimed. \"Don't you think so,\nRosalie?\"\n\n\"It was the most wonderful thing I ever saw,\" admitted the Witch. \"The\nfairies who control Button-Bright's umbrella must be very powerful\nindeed!\"\n\n\n\n\nTROT REGULATES THE PINKIES\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\n\nThe Pinkies were rejoiced to find themselves again in their beloved\nland of sunrises and sunsets. They sang and shouted with glee, and the\nBand uncovered its pink instruments and played the National Pink\nAnthem, while the parrot flew from Trot's shoulder to Cap'n Bill's\nshoulder and back again, screaming ecstatically,\n\n  \"Hooray! We're through the wetful fogs\n  Where the elephant scared the fretful frogs!\"\n\nThere was a magnificent sunset in the sky just then, and it cheered the\nPinkies and gave them renewed strength. Away they hastened across the\npink fields to the Pink City, where all the Pink people who had been\nleft behind ran out to welcome them home again.\n\nTrot and Button-Bright, with Cap'n Bill and Rosalie the Witch, went to\nthe humble palace, where they had a simple supper of coarse food and\nslept upon hard beds. In the houses of the City, however, there was\nmuch feasting and merrymaking, and it seemed to Trot that the laws of\nthe country which forbade the Queen from enjoying all the good things\nthe people did were decidedly wrong and needed changing.\n\nThe next morning Rosalie said to the little girl, \"Will you make\nTourmaline the Queen again when you go away?\"\n\n\"I'll send for her and see about it,\" replied Trot.\n\nBut when Tourmaline arrived at the palace, dressed all in lovely,\nfluffy robes and with a dainty pink plume in her pink hair, she begged\nmost earnestly not to be made the Queen again.\n\n\"I'm having a good time just now after years of worry and uncomfortable\nliving in this uncomfortable old hut of a palace,\" said the poor girl,\n\"so it would be cruel for you to make me the servant of the people\nagain and condemn me to want and misery.\"\n\n\"That seems reason'ble,\" replied Trot thoughtfully.\n\n\"Rosalie's skin is just as light a pink as my own,\" continued\nTourmaline. \"Why don't you make her the Queen?\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of that,\" said Trot. Then she turned to Rosalie and\nasked, \"How would you like to rule the Pinkies?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't like it,\" replied the Witch with a smile. \"The Queen is the\npoorest and most miserable creature in all the kingdom, and I'm sure I\ndon't deserve such a fate. I've always tried to be a good witch and to\ndo my duty.\"\n\nTrot thought this over quite seriously for a time. Then one of her\nquaint ideas came to her--so quaint that it was entirely sensible. \"I'm\nthe Queen of the Pinkies just now, am I not?\" she asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" answered Rosalie. \"None can dispute that.\"\n\n\"Then I've the right to make new laws, haven't I?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the girl, \"I'm goin' to make a law that the Queen\nshall have the same food an' the same dresses an' the same good times\nthat her people have; and she shall live in a house jus' as good as the\nhouses of any of her people, an' have as much money to spend as\nanybody. But no more. The Queen can have her share of ever'thing\n'cordin' to the new law, but if she tries to get more than her share,\nI'll have the law say she shall be taken to the edge an' pushed off.\nWhat do you think of THAT law, Rosalie?\"\n\n\"It's a good law and a just one,\" replied the Witch approvingly.\n\nSo Trot sent for the Royal Scribbler, who was a very fat Pinky with\nlarge, pink eyes and curly pink hair, and had him carefully write the\nnew law into the Great Book of Laws. The Royal Scribbler wrote it very\nnicely in pink ink, with a big capital letter at the beginning and a\nfine flourish at the end. After Trot had signed her name to it as\nQueen, she called all of the important people of the land to assemble\nin the Court of the Statues and ordered the Royal Declaimer to read to\nthem the new law. The Pinkies seemed to think it was a just law and\nmuch better than the old one, and Rosalie said:\n\n\"Now no one can object to becoming Queen, since the Ruler of the\nPinkies will no longer be obliged to endure suffering and hardships.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Trot. \"In that case, I'll make you the Queen,\nRosalie, for you've got more sense than Tourmaline has and your powers\nas a witch will help you protect the people.\"\n\nAt once she made the announcement, telling the assembled Pinkies that\nby virtue of her high office as Queen of Sky Island she would leave\nRosalie the Witch to rule over the Pink Country while she returned to\nthe Earth with her friends. As Rosalie was greatly loved and respected,\nthe people joyfully accepted her as their Queen, and Trot ordered them\nto tear down the old hut and build a new palace for Rosalie--one which\nwould be just as good as any other house in the City, but no better.\nShe further ordered a pink statue of Tourmaline to be set up in the\nCourt, and also a pink statue of herself, so that the record of all the\nrulers of the Pinkies should be complete.\n\nThe people agreed to do all this as soon as possible, and some of the\nleaders whispered together and then asked Coralie to be their spokesman\nin replying to Queen Trot's speech.\n\nCoralie stood on a chair and made a bow, after which she thanked Trot\nin the name of the Pinkies for leading them safely into the Blue\nCountry and out again, and for giving them so good a Queen as Rosalie.\nThe Pinkies would be sorry to have their new friends, the Earth people,\nleave them, but asked the Queen of Sky Island to carry with her the\nroyal band of pink gold which she now wore upon her brow, together with\nthe glistening pink jewel set in its center. It would remind her,\nCoralie declared, of the Beautiful Land of Sunset and Sunrise and of\nthe fact that the Pinkies would always be glad to welcome her back.\n\nTrot knew she would never return to Sky Island, but she did not tell\nthem that. She merely thanked Coralie and the Pinkies and said they\nmight all come to the Court after dinner and see her and her comrades\nfly away through the sky.\n\n\n\n\nTHE JOURNEY HOME\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\n\nAfter the Pinkies had been dismissed, their new Queen Rosalie, by means\nof a clever charm, conjured up a dinner table set with very nice things\nto eat. They all enjoyed a hearty meal and afterward sat and talked\nover their adventures.\n\n\"Will you take the parrot home with you, Trot?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Guess not, Cap'n,\" she answered. \"Mother wouldn't like to have him\nhangin' 'round an' screechin' bad po'try ev'ry minute. I'll give him to\nRosalie, for I'm sure she'll take good care of him.\"\n\nRosalie accepted the gift with pleasure, but the parrot looked sober\nfor a while and then said,\n\n  \"This looks to me like a giveaway;\n  But here I am, and here I'll stay.\n  The country's pink, but we'll all be blue\n  When Trot goes home as she says she'll do.\"\n\nThey now packed the lunchbasket with the remains of the feast, for they\nknew a long journey was before them and feared they might be hungry\nbefore they landed again. Cap'n Bill straightened out the ropes and\nadjusted the seats, while Button-Bright examined the umbrella to see if\nit had been injured in any way when the elephant tramped through the\nFog Bank.\n\nThe boy looked into the small red eyes of the carved elephant's-head\nhandle with some misgivings, but as seen in the strong sunshine the\neyes were merely red stones, while the handle plainly showed the marks\nof the tool that had carved it.\n\nWhen all was ready, they went into the Court of the Statues, where all\nthe Pinkies were assembled--together with their Pink Band--and Cap'n\nBill hooked the swinging seats onto the handle of the Magic Umbrella.\n\nTrot kissed Rosalie and Coralie and Tourmaline goodbye and said to them:\n\n\"If you ever happen to come to Earth, you must be sure to visit me, and\nI'll try to give you a good time. But p'raps you'll stay here all your\nlives.\"\n\n\"I think we shall,\" replied Rosalie, laughing, \"for in all Sky Island\nthere will be no Magic Umbrella for us to fly with.\"\n\n\"And when you see Polychrome,\" added Trot, \"jus' give her my love.\"\n\nThen she and Button-Bright seated themselves in the double seat, which\nwas flat upon the pink ground, and Cap'n Bill sat before them on his\nown seat, to which the lunch basket had been fastened by means of a\nstout cord.\n\n\"Hold fast!\" said the sailor man, and they all held fast to the ropes\nwhile the boy, glancing up toward the open umbrella he held, said\nsolemnly and distinctly:\n\n\"Take us to Trot's house on the Earth.\" The umbrella obeyed, at once\nmounting into the air. It moved slowly at first, but gradually\nincreased its speed. First it lifted the seat of the boy and the girl,\nthen Cap'n Bill's seat, and finally the lunch basket.\n\n  \"Fly high!--Mind your eye!\n  Don't cry!--Bye-bye!\"\n\nshouted the parrot from the Pink Witch's shoulder.\n\nTrot leaned over and waved her hand. The Pink Band played as loud as it\ncould--in order that the travelers might hear it as long as\npossible--and Rosalie and Coralie and Tourmaline threw kisses to their\nvanishing friends as long as they remained in sight.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Seems good to be on the way home again,\" remarked Trot as the umbrella\nbumped into a big, black cloud.\n\n\"It reely does, mate,\" answered the sailorman joyously.\n\nFast through the cloud the umbrella swept, and then suddenly it sailed\ninto a clear, blue sky, across which a great and gorgeous Rainbow\nspread its radiant arch. Upon the bow danced the dainty Daughters of\nthe Rainbow, and the umbrella passed near enough to it for the\npassengers to observe Polychrome merrily leading her sisters, her\nfleecy robes waving prettily in the gentle breeze.\n\n\"Goodbye, Polly!\" cried Button-Bright, and Trot and Cap'n Bill both\ncalled out, \"Goodbye!\"\n\nPolychrome heard and nodded to them smilingly, never halting in her\ngraceful dance. Then the umbrella dropped far below the arch, which\npresently faded from view.\n\nIt was an exciting ride. Scenes presented themselves entirely different\nfrom those they had seen on their former voyage, for the sky changes\ncontinually, and the clouds of a moment ago are not the clouds of an\nhour ago. Once they passed between two small stars as brilliant as\ndiamonds, and once an enormous bird whose wings spread so wide that\nthey shadowed the sun soared directly over them and lost itself in the\nvague distance of the limitless sky.\n\nThey rode quite comfortably, however, and were full of eager interest\nin what they saw. The rush of air past them made them hungry, so Cap'n\nBill drew up the lunchbasket and held it so that Button-Bright and Trot\ncould help themselves to the pink food, which tasted very good. And\nfinally a dark rim appeared below them, which the sailor declared must\nbe the Earth. He proved to be correct, and when they came nearer, they\nfound themselves flying over the waves of the ocean. Pretty soon a\nsmall island appeared, and Trot exclaimed,\n\n\"That's the Sky Island we thought we were goin' to--only we didn't.\"\n\n\"Yes, an' there's the mainland, mate!\" cried Cap'n Bill excitedly,\npointing toward a distant coast.\n\nOn swept the Magic Umbrella. Then its speed gradually slackened; the\nhouses and trees on the coast could be seen, and presently--almost\nbefore they realized it--they were set down gently upon the high bluff\nnear the giant acacia. A little way off stood the white cottage where\nTrot lived.\n\nIt was growing dusk as Cap'n Bill unhooked the seats and Button-Bright\nfolded up the umbrella and tucked it under his arm. Trot seized the\nlunchbasket and ran to the house, where she found her mother busy in\nthe kitchen.\n\n\"Well, I'm back again,\" said the little girl. \"Is supper ready, mama?\"\n\nButton-Bright stayed all night with them, but next morning, bright and\nearly, he hooked one of the seats to his Magic Umbrella, said goodbye\nto Trot and Cap'n Bill, and flew into the air to begin his journey to\nPhiladelphia. Just before he started, Trot said:\n\n\"Let me know if you get home safe, Button-Bright, an' come an' see me\nagain as quick as you can.\"\n\n\"I'll try to come again,\" said the boy. \"We've had a good time, haven't\nwe, Trot?\"\n\n\"The bes' time I EVER had!\" she replied enthusiastically. Then she\nasked, \"Didn't you like it, too, Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"Parts o' it, mate,\" the sailor answered as he thoughtfully made marks\nin the sand with the end of his wooden leg, \"but seems to me the bes'\npart of all was gett'n' home again.\"\n\nAfter several days Trot received a postal card from Button-Bright. It\nwas awkwardly scrawled, for the boy was not much of a writer, but Trot\nmanaged to make out the words. It read as follows:\n\n\n\"Got home safe, Trot, and the folks were so worried they forgot to\nscold me. Father has taken the Magic Umbrella and locked it up in the\nbig, strong chest in the attic.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
