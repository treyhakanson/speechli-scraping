As I write it\nin August 1916, I am at Ebrington Barracks, Londonderry, recovering\nfrom a slight wound. But it does not greatly matter where I am; my\ndreams are here before you amongst the following pages; and writing in\na day when life is cheap, dreams seem to me all the dearer, the only\nthings that survive.\n\nJust now the civilization of Europe seems almost to have ceased, and\nnothing seems to grow in her torn fields but death, yet this is only\nfor a while and dreams will come back again and bloom as of old, all\nthe more radiantly for this terrible ploughing, as the flowers will\nbloom again where the trenches are and the primroses shelter in\nshell-holes for many seasons, when weeping Liberty has come home to\nFlanders.\n\nTo some of you in America this may seem an unnecessary and wasteful\nquarrel, as other people's quarrels often are; but it comes to this\nthat though we are all killed there will be songs again, but if we\nwere to submit and so survive there could be neither songs nor dreams,\nnor any joyous free things any more.\n\nAnd do not regret the lives that are wasted amongst us, or the work\nthat the dead would have done, for war is no accident that man's care\ncould have averted, but is as natural, though not as regular, as the\ntides; as well regret the things that the tide has washed away, which\ndestroys and cleanses and crumbles, and spares the minutest shells.\n\nAnd now I will write nothing further about our war, but offer you\nthese books of dreams from Europe as one throws things of value, if\nonly to oneself, at the last moment out of a burning house.\n\n                                                             DUNSANY.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Tale of London\n\n\"Come,\" said the Sultan to his hasheesh-eater in the very furthest\nlands that know Bagdad, \"dream to me now of London.\"\n\nAnd the hasheesh-eater made a low obeisance and seated himself\ncross-legged upon a purple cushion broidered with golden poppies, on\nthe floor, beside an ivory bowl where the hasheesh was, and having\neaten liberally of the hasheesh blinked seven times and spoke thus:\n\n\"O Friend of God, know then that London is the desiderate town even of\nall Earth's cities. Its houses are of ebony and cedar which they roof\nwith thin copper plates that the hand of Time turns green. They have\ngolden balconies in which amethysts are where they sit and watch the\nsunset. Musicians in the gloaming steal softly along the ways; unheard\ntheir feet fall on the white sea-sand with which those ways are\nstrewn, and in the darkness suddenly they play on dulcimers and\ninstruments with strings. Then are there murmurs in the balconies\npraising their skill, then are there bracelets cast down to them for\nreward and golden necklaces and even pearls.\n\n\"Indeed but the city is fair; there is by the sandy ways a paving all\nalabaster, and the lanterns along it are of chrysoprase, all night\nlong they shine green, but of amethyst are the lanterns of the\nbalconies.\n\n\"As the musicians go along the ways dancers gather about them and\ndance upon the alabaster pavings, for joy and not for hire. Sometimes\na window opens far up in an ebony palace and a wreath is cast down to\na dancer or orchids showered upon them.\n\n\"Indeed of many cities have I dreamt but of none fairer, through many\nmarble metropolitan gates hasheesh has led me, but London is its\nsecret, the last gate of all; the ivory bowl has nothing more to show.\nAnd indeed even now the imps that crawl behind me and that will not\nlet me be are plucking me by the elbow and bidding my spirit return,\nfor well they know that I have seen too much. 'No, not London,' they\nsay; and therefore I will speak of some other city, a city of some\nless mysterious land, and anger not the imps with forbidden things. I\nwill speak of Persepolis or famous Thebes.\"\n\nA shade of annoyance crossed the Sultan's face, a look of thunder that\nyou had scarcely seen, but in those lands they watched his visage\nwell, and though his spirit was wandering far away and his eyes were\nbleared with hasheesh yet that storyteller there and then perceived\nthe look that was death, and sent his spirit back at once to London as\na man runs into his house when the thunder comes.\n\n\"And therefore,\" he continued, \"in the desiderate city, in London, all\ntheir camels are pure white. Remarkable is the swiftness of their\nhorses, that draw their chariots that are of ivory along those sandy\nways and that are of surpassing lightness, they have little bells of\nsilver upon their horses' heads. O Friend of God, if you perceived\ntheir merchants! The glory of their dresses in the noonday! They are\nno less gorgeous than those butterflies that float about their\nstreets. They have overcloaks of green and vestments of azure, huge\npurple flowers blaze on their overcloaks, the work of cunning needles,\nthe centres of the flowers are of gold and the petals of purple. All\ntheir hats are black--\" (\"No, no,\" said the Sultan)--\"but irises are\nset about the brims, and green plumes float above the crowns of them.\n\n\"They have a river that is named the Thames, on it their ships go up\nwith violet sails bringing incense for the braziers that perfume the\nstreets, new songs exchanged for gold with alien tribes, raw silver\nfor the statues of their heroes, gold to make balconies where the\nwomen sit, great sapphires to reward their poets with, the secrets of\nold cities and strange lands, the earning of the dwellers in far\nisles, emeralds, diamonds, and the hoards of the sea. And whenever a\nship comes into port and furls its violet sails and the news spreads\nthrough London that she has come, then all the merchants go down to\nthe river to barter, and all day long the chariots whirl through the\nstreets, and the sound of their going is a mighty roar all day until\nevening, their roar is even like--\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said the Sultan.\n\n\"Truth is not hidden from the Friend of God,\" replied the\nhasheesh-eater, \"I have erred being drunken with the hasheesh, for in\nthe desiderate city, even in London, so thick upon the ways is the\nwhite sea-sand with which the city glimmers that no sound comes from\nthe path of the charioteers, but they go softly like a light\nsea-wind.\" (\"It is well,\" said the Sultan.) \"They go softly down to\nthe port where the vessels are, and the merchandise in from the sea,\namongst the wonders that the sailors show, on land by the high ships,\nand softly they go though swiftly at evening back to their homes.\n\n\"O would that the Munificent, the Illustrious, the Friend of God, had\neven seen these things, had seen the jewellers with their empty\nbaskets, bargaining there by the ships, when the barrels of emeralds\ncame up from the hold. Or would that he had seen the fountains there\nin silver basins in the midst of the ways. I have seen small spires\nupon their ebony houses and the spires were all of gold, birds\nstrutted there upon the copper roofs from golden spire to spire that\nhave no equal for splendour in all the woods of the world. And over\nLondon the desiderate city the sky is so deep a blue that by this\nalone the traveller may know where he has come, and may end his\nfortunate journey. Nor yet for any colour of the sky is there too\ngreat heat in London, for along its ways a wind blows always from the\nSouth gently and cools the city.\n\n\"Such, O Friend of God, is indeed the city of London, lying very far\noff on the yonder side of Bagdad, without a peer for beauty or\nexcellence of its ways among the towns of the earth or cities of song;\nand even so, as I have told, its fortunate citizens dwell, with their\nhearts ever devising beautiful things and from the beauty of their own\nfair work that is more abundant around them every year, receiving new\ninspirations to work things more beautiful yet.\"\n\n\"And is their government good?\" the Sultan said.\n\n\"It is most good,\" said the hasheesh-eater, and fell backwards upon\nthe floor.\n\nHe lay thus and was silent. And when the Sultan perceived he would\nspeak no more that night he smiled and lightly applauded.\n\nAnd there was envy in that palace, in lands beyond Bagdad, of all that\ndwell in London.\n\n\n\n\n\nThirteen at Table\n\nIn front of a spacious fireplace of the old kind, when the logs were\nwell alight, and men with pipes and glasses were gathered before it in\ngreat easeful chairs, and the wild weather outside and the comfort\nthat was within, and the season of the year--for it was Christmas--and\nthe hour of the night, all called for the weird or uncanny, then out\nspoke the ex-master of foxhounds and told this tale.\n\nI once had an odd experience too. It was when I had the Bromley and\nSydenham, the year I gave them up--as a matter of fact it was the last\nday of the season. It was no use going on because there were no foxes\nleft in the county, and London was sweeping down on us. You could see\nit from the kennels all along the skyline like a terrible army in\ngrey, and masses of villas every year came skirmishing down our\nvalleys. Our coverts were mostly on the hills, and as the town came\ndown upon the valleys the foxes used to leave them and go right away\nout of the county and they never returned. I think they went by night\nand moved great distances. Well it was early April and we had drawn\nblank all day, and at the last draw of all, the very last of the\nseason, we found a fox. He left the covert with his back to London and\nits railways and villas and wire and slipped away towards the chalk\ncountry and open Kent. I felt as I once felt as a child on one\nsummer's day when I found a door in a garden where I played left\nluckily ajar, and I pushed it open and the wide lands were before me\nand waving fields of corn.\n\nWe settled down into a steady gallop and the fields began to drift by\nunder us, and a great wind arose full of fresh breath. We left the\nclay lands where the bracken grows and came to a valley at the edge of\nthe chalk. As we went down into it we saw the fox go up the other side\nlike a shadow that crosses the evening, and glide into a wood that\nstood on the top. We saw a flash of primroses in the wood and we were\nout the other side, hounds hunting perfectly and the fox still going\nabsolutely straight. It began to dawn on me then that we were in for a\ngreat hunt, I took a deep breath when I thought of it; the taste of\nthe air of that perfect Spring afternoon as it came to one galloping,\nand the thought of a great run, were together like some old rare wine.\nOur faces now were to another valley, large fields led down to it,\nwith easy hedges, at the bottom of it a bright blue stream went\nsinging and a rambling village smoked, the sunlight on the opposite\nslopes danced like a fairy; and all along the top old woods were\nfrowning, but they dreamed of Spring. The \"field\" had fallen of and\nwere far behind and my only human companion was James, my old first\nwhip, who had a hound's instinct, and a personal animosity against a\nfox that even embittered his speech.\n\nAcross the valley the fox went as straight as a railway line, and\nagain we went without a check straight through the woods at the top. I\nremember hearing men sing or shout as they walked home from work, and\nsometimes children whistled; the sounds came up from the village to\nthe woods at the top of the valley. After that we saw no more\nvillages, but valley after valley arose and fell before us as though\nwe were voyaging some strange and stormy sea, and all the way before\nus the fox went dead up-wind like the fabulous Flying Dutchman. There\nwas no one in sight now but my first whip and me, we had both of us\ngot on to our second horses as we drew the last covert.\n\nTwo or three times we checked in those great lonely valleys beyond the\nvillage, but I began to have inspirations, I felt a strange certainty\nwithin me that this fox was going on straight up-wind till he died or\nuntil night came and we could hunt no longer, so I reversed ordinary\nmethods and only cast straight ahead and always we picked up the scent\nagain at once. I believe that this fox was the last one left in the\nvilla-haunted lands and that he was prepared to leave them for remote\nuplands far from men, that if we had come the following day he would\nnot have been there, and that we just happened to hit off his journey.\n\nEvening began to descend upon the valleys, still the hounds drifted\non, like the lazy but unresting shadows of clouds upon a summer's day,\nwe heard a shepherd calling to his dog, we saw two maidens move\ntowards a hidden farm, one of them singing softly; no other sounds,\nbut ours, disturbed the leisure and the loneliness of haunts that\nseemed not yet to have known the inventions of steam and gun-powder\n(even as China, they say, in some of her further mountains does not\nyet know that she has fought Japan).\n\nAnd now the day and our horses were wearing out, but that resolute fox\nheld on. I began to work out the run and to wonder where we were. The\nlast landmark I had ever seen before must have been over five miles\nback and from there to the start was at least ten miles more. If only\nwe could kill! Then the sun set. I wondered what chance we had of\nkilling our fox. I looked at James' face as he rode beside me. He did\nnot seem to have lost any confidence yet his horse was as tired as\nmine. It was a good clear twilight and the scent was as strong as\never, and the fences were easy enough, but those valleys were terribly\ntrying and they still rolled on and on. It looked as if the light\nwould outlast all possible endurance both of the fox and the horses,\nif the scent held good and he did not go to ground, otherwise night\nwould end it. For long we had seen no houses and no roads, only chalk\nslopes with the twilight on them, and here and there some sheep, and\nscattered copses darkening in the evening. At some moment I seemed to\nrealise all at once that the light was spent and that darkness was\nhovering, I looked at James, he was solemnly shaking his head.\nSuddenly in a little wooded valley we saw climb over the oaks the\nred-brown gables of a queer old house, at that instant I saw the fox\nscarcely heading by fifty yards. We blundered through a wood into full\nsight of the house, but no avenue led up to it or even a path nor were\nthere any signs of wheel-marks anywhere. Already lights shone here and\nthere in windows. We were in a park, and a fine park, but unkempt\nbeyond credibility; brambles grew everywhere. It was too dark to see\nthe fox any more but we knew he was dead beat, the hounds were just\nbefore us,--and a four-foot railing of oak. I shouldn't have tried it\non a fresh horse the beginning of a run, and here was a horse near his\nlast gasp. But what a run! an event standing out in a lifetime, and\nthe hounds close up on their fox, slipping into the darkness as I\nhesitated. I decided to try it. My horse rose about eight inches and\ntook it fair with his breast, and the oak log flew into handfuls of\nwet decay--it rotten with years. And then we were on a lawn and at the\nfar end of it the hounds were tumbling over their fox. Fox, hounds and\nlight were all done together at the of a twenty-mile point. We made\nsome noise then, but nobody came out of the queer old house.\n\nI felt pretty stiff as I walked round to the hall door with the mask\nand the brush while James went with the hounds and the two horses to\nlook for the stables. I rang a bell marvellously encrusted with rust,\nand after a long while the door opened a little way revealing a hall\nwith much old armour in it and the shabbiest butler that I have ever\nknown.\n\nI asked him who lived there. Sir Richard Arlen. I explained that my\nhorse could go no further that night and that I wished to ask Sir\nRichard Arlen for a bed for the night.\n\n\"O, no one ever comes here, sir,\" said the butler.\n\nI pointed out that I had come.\n\n\"I don't think it would be possible, sir,\" he said.\n\nThis annoyed me and I asked to see Sir Richard, and insisted until he\ncame. Then I apologised and explained the situation. He looked only\nfifty, but a 'Varsity oar on the wall with the date of the early\nseventies, made him older than that; his face had something of the shy\nlook of the hermit; he regretted that he had not room to put me up. I\nwas sure that this was untrue, also I had to be put up there, there\nwas nowhere else within miles, so I almost insisted. Then to my\nastonishment he turned to the butler and they talked it over in an\nundertone. At last they seemed to think that they could manage it,\nthough clearly with reluctance. It was by now seven o' clock and Sir\nRichard told me he dined at half past seven. There was no question of\nclothes for me other than those I stood in, as my host was shorter and\nbroader. He showed me presently to the drawing-room and there he\nreappeared before half past seven in evening dress and a white\nwaistcoat. The drawing-room was large and contained old furniture but\nit was rather worn than venerable, an Aubusson carpet flapped about\nthe floor, the wind seemed momently to enter the room, and old\ndraughts haunted corners; the stealthy feet of rats that were never at\nrest indicated the extent of the ruin that time had wrought in the\nwainscot; somewhere far off a shutter flapped to and fro, the\nguttering candles were insufficient to light so large a room. The\ngloom that these things suggested was quite in keeping with Sir\nRichard's first remark to me after he entered the room: \"I must tell\nyou, sir, that I have led a wicked life. O, a very wicked life.\"\n\nSuch confidences from a man much older than oneself after one has\nknown him for half an hour are so rare that any possible answer merely\ndoes not suggest itself. I said rather slowly, \"O, really,\" and\nchiefly to forestall another such remark I said \"What a charming house\nyou have.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I have not left it for nearly forty years. Since I\nleft the 'Varsity. One is young there, you know, and one has\nopportunities; but I make no excuses, no excuses.\" And the door\nslipping its rusty latch, came drifting on the draught into the room,\nand the long carpet flapped and the hangings upon the walls, then the\ndraught fell rustling away and the door slammed to again.\n\n\"Ah, Marianne,\" he said, \"we have a guest to-night. Mr. Linton. This\nis Marianne Gib.\" And everything became clear to me. \"Mad,\" I said to\nmyself, for no one had entered the room.\n\nThe rats ran up the length of the room behind the wainscot\nceaselessly, and the wind unlatched the door again and the folds of\nthe carpet fluttered up to our feet and stopped there, for our weight\nheld it down.\n\n\"Let me introduce Mr. Linton,\" said my host--\"Lady Mary Errinjer.\"\n\nThe door slammed back again. I bowed politely. Even had I been invited\nI should have humoured him, but it was the very least that an\nuninvited guest could do.\n\nThis kind of thing happened eleven times, the rustling, and the\nfluttering of the carpet and the footsteps of the rats, and the\nrestless door, and then the sad voice of my host introducing me to\nphantoms. Then for some while we waited while I struggled with the\nsituation; conversation flowed slowly. And again the draught came\ntrailing up the room, while the flaring candles filled it with\nhurrying shadows. \"Ah, late again, Cicely,\" said my host in his soft,\nmournful way. \"Always late, Cicely.\" Then I went down to dinner with\nthat man and his mind and the twelve phantoms that haunted it. I found\na long table with fine old silver on it and places laid for fourteen.\nThe butler was now in evening dress, there were fewer draughts in the\ndining-room, the scene was less gloomy there. \"Will you sit next to\nRosalind at the other end,\" Richard said to me. \"She always takes the\nhead of the table, I wronged her most of all.\" I said, \"I shall be\ndelighted.\"\n\nI looked at the butler closely, but never did I see by any expression\nof his face or by anything that he did any suggestion that he waited\nupon less than fourteen people in the complete possession of all their\nfaculties. Perhaps a dish appeared to be refused more often than taken\nbut every glass was equally filled with champagne. At first I found\nlittle to say, but when Sir Richard speaking from the far end of the\ntable said, \"You are tired, Mr. Linton,\" I was reminded that I owed\nsomething to a host upon whom I had forced myself. It was excellent\nchampagne and with the help of a second glass I made the effort to\nbegin a conversation with a Miss Helen Errold for whom the place upon\none side of me was laid. It came more easy to me very soon, I\nfrequently paused in my monologue, like Mark Anthony, for a reply, and\nsometimes I turned and spoke to Miss Rosalind Smith. Sir Richard at\nthe other end talked sorrowfully on, he spoke as a condemned man might\nspeak to his judge, and yet somewhat as a judge might speak to one\nthat he once condemned wrongly. My own mind began to turn to mournful\nthings. I drank another glass of champagne, but I was still thirsty. I\nfelt as if all the moisture in my body had been blown away over the\ndowns of Kent by the wind up which we had galloped. Still I was not\ntalking enough; my host was looking at me. I made another effort,\nafter all I had something to talk about, a twenty-mile point is not\noften seen in a lifetime, especially south of the Thames. I began to\ndescribe the run to Rosalind Smith. I could see then that my host was\npleased, the sad look in his face gave a kind of a flicker, like mist\nupon the mountains on a miserable day when a faint puff comes from the\nsea and the mist would lift if it could. And the butler refilled my\nglass very attentively. I asked her first if she hunted, and paused\nand began my story. I told her where we had found the fox and how fast\nand straight he had gone, and how I had got through the village by\nkeeping to the road, while the little gardens and wire, and then the\nriver, had stopped the rest of the field. I told her the kind of\ncountry that we crossed and how splendid it looked in the Spring, and\nhow mysterious the valleys were as soon as the twilight came, and what\na glorious horse I had and how wonderfully he went. I was so fearfully\nthirsty after the great hunt that I had to stop for a moment now and\nthen, but I went on with my description of that famous run, for I had\nwarmed to the subject, and after all there was nobody to tell of it\nbut me except my old whipper-in, and \"the old fellow's probably drunk\nby now,\" I thought. I described to her minutely the exact spot in the\nrun at which it had come to me clearly that this was going to be the\ngreatest hunt in the whole history of Kent. Sometimes I forgot\nincidents that had happened as one well may in a run of twenty miles,\nand then I had to fill in the gaps by inventing. I was pleased to be\nable to make the party go off well by means of my conversation, and\nbesides that the lady to whom I was speaking was extremely pretty: I\ndo not mean in a flesh and blood kind of way but there were little\nshadowy lines about the chair beside me that hinted at an unusually\ngraceful figure when Miss Rosalind Smith was alive; and I began to\nperceive that what I first mistook for the smoke of guttering candles\nand a table-cloth waving in the draught was in reality an extremely\nanimated company who listened, and not without interest, to my story\nof by far the greatest hunt that the world had ever known: indeed I\ntold them that I would confidently go further and predict that never\nin the history of the world would there be such a run again. Only my\nthroat was terribly dry. And then as it seemed they wanted to hear\nmore about my horse. I had forgotten that I had come there on a horse,\nbut when they reminded me it all came back; they looked so charming\nleaning over the table intent upon what I said, that I told them\neverything they wanted to know. Everything was going so pleasantly if\nonly Sir Richard would cheer up. I heard his mournful voice every now\nand then--these were very pleasant people if only he would take them\nthe right way. I could understand that he regretted his past, but the\nearly seventies seemed centuries away and I felt sure that he\nmisunderstood these ladies, they were not revengeful as he seemed to\nsuppose. I wanted to show him how cheerful they really were, and so I\nmade a joke and they an laughed at it, and then I chaffed them a bit,\nespecially Rosalind, and nobody resented it in the very least. And\nstill Sir Richard sat there with that unhappy look, like one that has\nended weeping because it is vain and has not the consolation even of\ntears.\n\nWe had been a long time there and many of the candles had burned out,\nbut there was light enough. I was glad to have an audience for my\nexploit, and being happy myself I was determined Sir Richard should\nbe. I made more jokes and they still laughed good-naturedly; some of\nthe jokes were a little broad perhaps but no harm was meant. And\nthen--I do not wish to excuse myself--but I had had a harder day than\nI ever had had before and without knowing it I must have been\ncompletely exhausted; in this state the champagne had found me, and\nwhat would have been harmless at any other time must somehow have got\nthe better of me when quite tired out--anyhow I went too far, I made\nsome joke--I cannot in the least remember what--that suddenly seemed\nto offend them. I felt all at once a commotion in the air, I looked up\nand saw that they had all arisen from the table and were sweeping\ntowards the door: I had not time to open it but it blew open on a\nwind, I could scarcely see what Sir Richard was doing because only two\ncandles were left, I think the rest blew out when the ladies suddenly\nrose. I sprang up to apologise, to assure them--and then fatigue\novercame me as it had overcome my horse at the last fence, I clutched\nat the table but the cloth came away and then I fell. The fall, and\nthe darkness on the floor and the pent up fatigue of the day overcame\nme all three together.\n\nThe sun shone over glittering fields and in at a bedroom window and\nthousands of birds were chanting to the Spring, and there I was in an\nold four-poster bed in a quaint old panelled bedroom, fully dressed\nand wearing long muddy boots; someone had taken my spurs and that was\nall. For a moment I failed to realise and then it all came back, my\nenormity and the pressing need of an abject apology to Sir Richard. I\npulled an embroidered bell rope until the butler came. He came in\nperfectly cheerful and indescribably shabby. I asked him if Sir\nRichard was up, and he said he had just gone down, and told me to my\namazement that it was twelve o'clock. I asked to be shown in to Sir\nRichard at once. He was in his smoking-room. \"Good morning,\" he said\ncheerfully the moment I went in. I went directly to the matter in\nhand. \"I fear that I insulted some ladies in your house--\" I began.\n\n\"You did indeed,\" he said, \"You did indeed.\" And then he burst into\ntears and took me by the hand. \"How can I ever thank you?\" he said to\nme then. \"We have been thirteen at table for thirty years and I never\ndared to insult them because I had wronged them all, and now you have\ndone it and I know they will never dine here again.\" And for a long\ntime he still held my hand, and then he gave it a grip and a kind of a\nshake which I took to mean \"Goodbye\" and I drew my hand away then and\nleft the house. And I found James in the stables with the hounds and\nasked him how he had fared, and James, who is a man of very few words,\nsaid he could not rightly remember, and I got my spurs from the butler\nand climbed on to my horse and slowly we rode away from that queer old\nhouse, and slowly we wended home, for the hounds were footsore but\nhappy and the horses were tired still. And when we recalled that the\nhunting season was ended we turned our faces to Spring and thought of\nthe new things that try to replace the old. And that very year I\nheard, and have often heard since, of dances and happier dinners at\nSir Richard Arlen's house.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe City on Mallington Moor\n\nBesides the old shepherd at Lingwold whose habits render him\nunreliable I am probably the only person that has ever seen the city\non Mallington Moor.\n\nI had decided one year to do no London season; partly because of the\nugliness of the things in the shops, partly because of the unresisted\ninvasions of German bands, partly perhaps because some pet parrots in\nthe oblong where I lived had learned to imitate cab-whistles; but\nchiefly because of late there had seized me in London a quite\nunreasonable longing for large woods and waste spaces, while the very\nthought of little valleys underneath copses full of bracken and\nfoxgloves was a torment to me and every summer in London the longing\ngrew worse till the thing was becoming intolerable. So I took a stick\nand a knapsack and began walking northwards, starting at Tetherington\nand sleeping at inns, where one could get real salt, and the waiter\nspoke English and where one had a name instead of a number; and though\nthe tablecloth might be dirty the windows opened so that the air was\nclean, where one had the excellent company of farmers and men of the\nwold, who could not be thoroughly vulgar, because they had not the\nmoney to be so even if they had wished it. At first the novelty was\ndelightful, and then one day in a queer old inn up Uthering way,\nbeyond Lingwold, I heard for the first time the rumour of the city\nsaid to be on Mallington Moor. They spoke of it quite casually over\ntheir glasses of beer, two farmers at the inn. \"They say the queer\nfolk be at Mallington with their city,\" one farmer said. \"Travelling\nthey seem to be,\" said the other. And more came in then and the rumour\nspread. And then, such are the contradictions of our little likes and\ndislikes and all the whims that drive us, that I, who had come so far\nto avoid cities, had a great longing all of a sudden for throngs again\nand the great hives of Man, and then and there determined on that\nbright Sunday morning to come to Mallington and there search for the\ncity that rumour spoke of so strangely.\n\nMallington Moor, from all that they said of it, was hardly a likely\nplace to find a thing by searching. It was a huge high moor, very\nbleak and desolate and altogether trackless. It seemed a lonely place\nfrom what they said. The Normans when they came had called it Mal Lieu\nand afterwards Mallintown and so it changed to Mallington. Though what\na town can ever have had to do with a place so utterly desolate I do\nnot know. And before that some say that the Saxons called it Baplas,\nwhich I believe to be a corruption of Bad Place.\n\nAnd beyond the mere rumour of a beautiful city all of white marble and\nwith a foreign look up on Mallington Moor, beyond this I could not\nget. None of them had seen it himself, \"only heard of it like,\" and my\nquestions, rather than stimulating conversation, would always stop it\nabruptly. I was no more fortunate on the road to Mallington until the\nTuesday, when I was quite near it; I had been walking two days from\nthe inn where I had heard the rumour and could see the great hill\nsteep as a headland on which Mallington lay, standing up on the\nskyline: the hill was covered with grass, where anything grew at all,\nbut Mallington Moor is all heather; it is just marked Moor on the map;\nnobody goes there and they do not trouble to name it. It was there\nwhere the gaunt hill first came into sight, by the roadside as I\nenquired for the marble city of some labourers by the way, that I was\ndirected, partly I think in derision, to the old shepherd of Lingwold.\nIt appeared that he, following sometimes sheep that had strayed, and\nwandering far from Lingwold, came sometimes up to the edge of\nMallington Moor, and that he would come back from these excursions and\nshout through the villages, raving of a city of white marble and\ngold-tipped minarets. And hearing me asking questions of this city\nthey had laughed and directed me to the shepherd of Lingwold. One\nwell-meant warning they gave me as I went--the old man was not\nreliable.\n\nAnd late that evening I saw the thatches of Lingwold sheltering under\nthe edge of that huge hill that Atlas-like held up those miles of moor\nto the great winds and heaven.\n\nThey knew less of the city in Lingwold than elsewhere but they knew\nthe whereabouts of the man I wanted, though they seemed a little\nashamed of him. There was an inn in Lingwold that gave me shelter,\nwhence in the morning, equipped with purchases, I set out to find\ntheir shepherd. And there he was on the edge of Mallington Moor\nstanding motionless, gazing stupidly at his sheep; his hands trembled\ncontinually and his eyes had a blear look, but he was quite sober,\nwherein all Lingwold had wronged him.\n\nAnd then and there I asked him of the city and he said he had never\nheard tell of any such place. And I said, \"Come, come, you must pull\nyourself together.\" And he looked angrily at me; but when he saw me\ndraw from amongst my purchases a full bottle of whiskey and a big\nglass he became more friendly. As I poured out the whiskey I asked him\nagain about the marble city on Mallington Moor but he seemed quite\nhonestly to know nothing about it. The amount of whiskey he drank was\nquite incredible, but I seldom express surprise and once more I asked\nhim the way to the wonderful city. His hand was steadier now and his\neyes more intelligent and he said that he had heard something of some\nsuch city, but his memory was evidently blurred and he was still\nunable to give me useful directions. I consequently gave him another\ntumbler, which he drank off like the first without any water, and\nalmost at once he was a different man. The trembling in his hands\nstopped altogether, his eye became as quick as a younger man's, he\nanswered my questions readily and frankly, and, what was more\nimportant to me still, his old memory became alert and clear for even\nminutest details. His gratitude to myself I need not mention, for I\nmake no pretence that I bought the bottle of whiskey that the old\nshepherd enjoyed so much without at least some thought of my own\nadvantage. Yet it was pleasant to reflect that it was due to me that\nhe had pulled himself together and steadied his shaking hand and\ncleared his mind, recovered his memory and his self-respect. He spoke\nto me quite clearly, no longer slurring his words; he had seen the\ncity first one moonlight night when he was lost in the mist on the big\nmoor, he had wandered far in the mist, and when it lifted he saw the\ncity by moonlight. He had no food, but luckily had his flask. There\nnever was such a city, not even in books. Travellers talked sometimes\nof Venice seen from the sea, there might be such a place or there\nmight not, but, whether or no, it was nothing to the city on\nMallington Moor. Men who read books had talked to him in his time,\nhundreds of books, but they never could tell of any city like this.\nWhy, the place was all of marble, roads, walls and palaces, all pure\nwhite marble, and the tops of the tall thin spires were entirely of\ngold. And they were queer folk in the city even for foreigners. And\nthere were camels, but I cut him short for I thought I could judge for\nmyself, if there was such a place, and, if not, I was wasting my time\nas well as a pint of good whiskey. So I got him to speak of the way,\nand after more circumlocution than I needed and more talk of the city\nhe pointed to a tiny track on the black earth just beside us, a little\ntwisty way you could hardly see.\n\nI said the moor was trackless; untrodden of man or dog it certainly\nwas and seemed to have less to do with the ways of man than any waste\nI have seen, but the track the old shepherd showed me, if track it\nwas, was no more than the track of a hare--an elf-path the old man\ncalled it, Heaven knows what he meant. And then before I left him he\ninsisted on giving me his flask with the queer strong rum it\ncontained. Whiskey brings out in some men melancholy, in some\nrejoicing, with him it was clearly generosity and he insisted until I\ntook his rum, though I did not mean to drink it. It was lonely up\nthere, he said, and bitter cold and the city hard to find, being set\nin a hollow, and I should need the rum, and he had never seen the\nmarble city except on days when he had had his flask: he seemed to\nregard that rusted iron flask as a sort of mascot, and in the end I\ntook it.\n\nI followed that odd, faint track on the black earth under the heather\ntill I came to the big grey stone beyond the horizon, where the track\ndivides into two, and I took the one to the left as the old man told\nme. I knew by another stone that I saw far off that I had not lost my\nway, nor the old man lied.\n\nAnd just as I hoped to see the city's ramparts before the gloaming\nfell on that desolate place, I suddenly saw a long high wall of\nwhiteness with pinnacles here and there thrown up above it, floating\ntowards me silent and grim as a secret, and knew it for that evil\nthing the mist. The sun, though low, was shining on every sprig of\nheather, the green and scarlet mosses were shining with it too, it\nseemed incredible that in three minutes' time all those colours would\nbe gone and nothing left all round but a grey darkness. I gave up hope\nof finding the city that day, a broader path than mine could have been\nquite easily lost. I hastily chose for my bed a thick patch of\nheather, wrapped myself in a waterproof cloak, and lay down and made\nmyself comfortable. And then the mist came. It came like the careful\npulling of lace curtains, then like the drawing of grey blinds; it\nshut out the horizon to the north, then to the east and west; it\nturned the whole sky white and hid the moor; it came down on it like a\nmetropolis, only utterly silent, silent and white as tombstones.\n\nAnd then I was glad of that strange strong rum, or whatever it was in\nthe flask that the shepherd gave me, for I did not think that the mist\nwould clear till night, and I feared the night would be cold. So I\nnearly emptied the flask; and, sooner than I expected, I fell asleep,\nfor the first night out as a rule one does not sleep at once but is\nkept awake some while by the little winds and the unfamiliar sound of\nthe things that wander at night, and that cry to one another far-off\nwith their queer, faint voices; one misses them afterwards when one\ngets to houses again. But I heard none of these sounds in the mist\nthat evening.\n\nAnd then I woke and found that the mist was gone and the sun was just\ndisappearing under the moor, and I knew that I had not slept for as\nlong as I thought. And I decided to go on while I could, for I thought\nthat I was not very far from the city.\n\nI went on and on along the twisty track, bits of the mist came down\nand filled the hollows but lifted again at once so that I saw my way.\nThe twilight faded as I went, a star appeared, and I was able to see\nthe track no longer. I could go no further that night, yet before I\nlay down to sleep I decided to go and look over the edge of a wide\ndepression in the moor that I saw a little way off. So I left the\ntrack and walked a few hundred yards, and when I got to the edge the\nhollow was full of mist all white underneath me. Another star appeared\nand a cold wind arose, and with the wind the mist flapped away like a\ncurtain. And there was the city.\n\nNothing the shepherd had said was the least untrue or even\nexaggerated. The poor old man had told the simple truth, there is not\na city like it in the world. What he had called thin spires were\nminarets, but the little domes on the top were clearly pure gold as he\nsaid. There were the marble terraces he described and the pure white\npalaces covered with carving and hundreds of minarets. The city was\nobviously of the East and yet where there should have been crescents\non the domes of the minarets there were golden suns with rays, and\nwherever one looked one saw things that obscured its origin. I walked\ndown to it, and, passing through a wicket gate of gold in a low wall\nof white marble, I entered the city. The heather went right up to the\ncity's edge and beat against the marble wall whenever the wind blew\nit. Lights began to twinkle from high windows of blue glass as I\nwalked up the white street, beautiful copper lanterns were lit up and\nlet down from balconies by silver chains, from doors ajar came the\nsound of voices singing, and then I saw the men. Their faces were\nrather grey than black, and they wore beautiful robes of coloured silk\nwith hems embroidered with gold and some with copper, and sometimes\npacing down the marble ways with golden baskets hung on each side of\nthem I saw the camels of which the old shepherd spoke.\n\nThe people had kindly faces, but, though they were evidently friendly\nto strangers, I could not speak with them being ignorant of their\nlanguage, nor were the sounds of the syllables they used like any\nlanguage I had ever heard: they sounded more like grouse.\n\nWhen I tried to ask them by signs whence they had come with their city\nthey would only point to the moon, which was bright and full and was\nshining fiercely on those marble ways till the city danced in light.\nAnd now there began appearing one by one, slipping softly out through\nwindows, men with stringed instruments in the balconies. They were\nstrange instruments with huge bulbs of wood, and they played softly on\nthem and very beautifully, and their queer voices softly sang to the\nmusic weird dirges of the griefs of their native land wherever that\nmay be. And far off in the heart of the city others were singing too,\nthe sound of it came to me wherever I roamed, not loud enough to\ndisturb my thoughts, but gently turning the mind to pleasant things.\nSlender carved arches of marble, as delicate almost as lace, crossed\nand re-crossed the ways wherever I went. There was none of that hurry\nof which foolish cities boast, nothing ugly or sordid so far as I\ncould see. I saw that it was a city of beauty and song. I wondered how\nthey had travelled with all that marble, how they had laid it down on\nMallington Moor, whence they had come and what their resources were,\nand determined to investigate closely next morning, for the old\nshepherd had not troubled his head to think how the city came, he had\nonly noted that the city was there (and of course no one believed him,\nthough that is partly his fault for his dissolute ways). But at night\none can see little and I had walked all day, so I determined to find a\nplace to rest in. And just as I was wondering whether to ask for\nshelter of those silk-robed men by signs or whether to sleep outside\nthe walls and enter again in the morning, I came to a great archway in\none of the marble houses with two black curtains, embroidered below\nwith gold, hanging across it. Over the archway were carved apparently\nin many tongues the words: \"Here strangers rest.\" In Greek, Latin and\nSpanish the sentence was repeated and there was writing also in the\nlanguage that you see on the walls of the great temples of Egypt, and\nArabic and what I took to be early Assyrian and one or two languages I\nhad never seen. I entered through the curtains and found a tesselated\nmarble court with golden braziers burning sleepy incense swinging by\nchains from the roof, all round the walls were comfortable mattresses\nlying upon the floor covered with cloths and silks. It must have been\nten o'clock and I was tired. Outside the music still softly filled the\nstreets, a man had set a lantern down on the marble way, five or six\nsat down round him, and he was sonorously telling them a story. Inside\nthere were some already asleep on the beds, in the middle of the wide\ncourt under the braziers a woman dressed in blue was singing very\ngently, she did not move, but sung on and on, I never heard a song\nthat was so soothing. I lay down on one of the mattresses by the wall,\nwhich was all inlaid with mosaics, and pulled over me some of the\ncloths with their beautiful alien work, and almost immediately my\nthoughts seemed part of the song that the woman was singing in the\nmidst of the court under the golden braziers that hung from the high\nroof, and the song turned them to dreams, and so I fell asleep.\n\nA small wind having arisen, I was awakened by a sprig of heather that\nbeat continually against my face. It was morning on Mallington Moor,\nand the city was quite gone.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the Milkman Shudders When He Perceives the Dawn\n\nIn the Hall of the Ancient Company of Milkmen round the great\nfireplace at the end, when the winter logs are burning and all the\ncraft are assembled they tell to-day, as their grandfathers told\nbefore them, why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.\n\nWhen dawn comes creeping over the edges of hills, peers through the\ntree-trunks making wonderful shadows, touches the tops of tall columns\nof smoke going up from awakening cottages in the valleys, and breaks\nall golden over Kentish fields, when going on tip-toe thence it comes\nto the walls of London and slips all shyly up those gloomy streets the\nmilkman perceives it and shudders.\n\nA man may be a Milkman's Working Apprentice, may know what borax is\nand how to mix it, yet not for that is the story told to him. There\nare five men alone that tell that story, five men appointed by the\nMaster of the Company, by whom each place is filled as it falls\nvacant, and if you do not hear it from one of them you hear the story\nfrom no one and so can never know why the milkman shudders when he\nperceives the dawn.\n\nIt is the way of one of these five men, greybeards all and milkmen\nfrom infancy, to rub his hands by the fire when the great logs burn,\nand to settle himself more easily in his chair, perhaps to sip some\ndrink far other than milk, then to look round to see that none are\nthere to whom it would not be fitting the tale should be told and,\nlooking from face to face and seeing none but the men of the Ancient\nCompany, and questioning mutely the rest of the five with his eyes, if\nsome of the five be there, and receiving their permission, to cough\nand to tell the tale. And a great hush falls in the Hall of the\nAncient Company, and something about the shape of the roof and the\nrafters makes the tale resonant all down the hall so that the youngest\nhears it far away from the fire and knows, and dreams of the day when\nperhaps he will tell himself why the milkman shudders when he\nperceives the dawn.\n\nNot as one tells some casual fact is it told, nor is it commented on\nfrom man to man, but it is told by that great fire only and when the\noccasion and the stillness of the room and the merit of the wine and\nthe profit of all seem to warrant it in the opinion of the five\ndeputed men: then does one of them tell it, as I have said, not\nheralded by any master of ceremonies but as though it arose out of the\nwarmth of the fire before which his knotted hands would chance to be;\nnot a thing learned by rote, but told differently by each teller, and\ndifferently according to his mood, yet never has one of them dared to\nalter its salient points, there is none so base among the Company of\nMilkmen. The Company of Powderers for the Face know of this story and\nhave envied it, the Worthy Company of Chin-Barbers, and the Company of\nWhiskerers; but none have heard it in the Milkmen's Hall, through\nwhose wall no rumour of the secret goes, and though they have invented\ntales of their own Antiquity mocks them.\n\nThis mellow story was ripe with honourable years when milkmen wore\nbeaver hats, its origin was still mysterious when smocks were the\nvogue, men asked one another when Stuarts were on the throne (and only\nthe Ancient Company knew the answer) why the milkman shudders when he\nperceives the dawn. It is all for envy of this tale's reputation that\nthe Company of Powderers for the Face have invented the tale that they\ntoo tell of an evening, \"Why the Dog Barks when he hears the step of\nthe Baker\"; and because probably all men know that tale the Company of\nthe Powderers for the Face have dared to consider it famous. Yet it\nlacks mystery and is not ancient, is not fortified with classical\nallusion, has no secret lore, is common to all who care for an idle\ntale, and shares with \"The Wars of the Elves,\" the Calf-butcher's\ntale, and \"The Story of the Unicorn and the Rose,\" which is the tale\nof the Company of Horse-drivers, their obvious inferiority.\n\nBut unlike all these tales so new to time, and many another that the\nlast two centuries tell, the tale that the milkmen tell ripples wisely\non, so full of quotation from the profoundest writers, so full of\nrecondite allusion, so deeply tinged with all the wisdom of man and\ninstructive with the experience of all times that they that hear it in\nthe Milkmen's Hall as they interpret allusion after allusion and trace\nobscure quotation lose idle curiosity and forget to question why the\nmilkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.\n\nYou also, O my reader, give not yourself up to curiosity. Consider of\nhow many it is the bane. Would you to gratify this tear away the\nmystery from the Milkmen's Hall and wrong the Ancient Company of\nMilkmen? Would they if all the world knew it and it became a common\nthing to tell that tale any more that they have told for the last four\nhundred years? Rather a silence would settle upon their hall and a\nuniversal regret for the ancient tale and the ancient winter evenings.\nAnd though curiosity were a proper consideration yet even then this is\nnot the proper place nor this the proper occasion for the Tale. For\nthe proper place is only the Milkmen's Hall and the proper occasion\nonly when logs burn well and when wine has been deeply drunken, then\nwhen the candles were burning well in long rows down to the dimness,\ndown to the darkness and mystery that lie at the end of the hall, then\nwere you one of the Company, and were I one of the five, would I rise\nfrom my seat by the fireside and tell you with all the embellishments\nthat it has gleaned from the ages that story that is the heirloom of\nthe milkmen. And the long candles would burn lower and lower and\ngutter and gutter away till they liquefied in their sockets, and\ndraughts would blow from the shadowy end of the hall stronger and\nstronger till the shadows came after them, and still I would hold you\nwith that treasured story, not by any wit of mine but all for the sake\nof its glamour and the times out of which it came; one by one the\ncandles would flare and die and, when all were gone, by the light of\nominous sparks when each milkman's face looks fearful to his fellow,\nyou would know, as now you cannot, why the milkman shudders when he\nperceives the dawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad Old Woman in Black\n\nThe bad old woman in black ran down the street of the ox-butchers.\n\nWindows at once were opened high up in those crazy gables; heads were\nthrust out: it was she. Then there arose the counsel of anxious\nvoices, calling sideways from window to window or across to opposite\nhouses. Why was she there with her sequins and bugles and old black\ngown? Why had she left her dreaded house? On what fell errand she\nhasted?\n\nThey watched her lean, lithe figure, and the wind in that old black\ndress, and soon she was gone from the cobbled street and under the\ntown's high gateway. She turned at once to her right and was hid from\nthe view of the houses. Then they all ran down to their doors, and\nsmall groups formed on the pavement; there they took counsel together,\nthe eldest speaking first. Of what they had seen they said nothing,\nfor there was no doubt it was she; it was of the future they spoke,\nand the future only.\n\nIn what notorious thing would her errand end? What gains had tempted\nher out from her fearful home? What brilliant but sinful scheme had\nher genius planned? Above all, what future evil did this portend? Thus\nat first it was only questions. And then the old grey-beards spoke,\neach one to a little group; they had seen her out before, had known\nher when she was younger, and had noted the evil things that had\nfollowed her goings: the small groups listened well to their low and\nearnest voices. No one asked questions now or guessed at her infamous\nerrand, but listened only to the wise old men who knew the things that\nhad been, and who told the younger men of the dooms that had come\nbefore.\n\nNobody knew how many times she had left her dreaded house; but the\noldest recounted all the times that they knew, and the way she had\ngone each time, and the doom that had followed her going; and two\ncould remember the earthquake that there was in the street of the\nshearers.\n\nSo were there many tales of the times that were, told on the pavement\nnear the old green doors by the edge of the cobbled street, and the\nexperience that the aged men had bought with their white hairs might\nbe had cheap by the young. But from all their experience only this was\nclear, that never twice in their lives had she done the same infamous\nthing, and that the same calamity twice had never followed her goings.\nTherefore it seemed that means were doubtful and few for finding out\nwhat thing was about to befall; and an ominous feeling of gloom came\ndown on the street of the ox-butchers. And in the gloom grew fears of\nthe very worst. This comfort they only had when they put their fear\ninto words--that the doom that followed her goings had never yet been\nanticipated. One feared that with magic she meant to move the moon;\nand he would have dammed the high tide on the neighbouring coast,\nknowing that as the moon attracted the sea the sea must attract the\nmoon, and hoping by his device to humble her spells. Another would\nhave fetched iron bars and clamped them across the street, remembering\nthe earthquake there was in the street of the shearers. Another would\nhave honoured his household gods, the little cat-faced idols seated\nabove his hearth, gods to whom magic was no unusual thing, and, having\npaid their fees and honoured them well, would have put the whole case\nbefore them. His scheme found favour with many, and yet at last was\nrejected, for others ran indoors and brought out their gods, too, to\nbe honoured, till there was a herd of gods all seated there on the\npavement; yet would they have honoured them and put their case before\nthem but that a fat man ran up last of all, carefully holding under a\nreverent arm his own two hound-faced gods, though he knew well--as,\nindeed, all men must--that they were notoriously at war with the\nlittle cat-faced idols. And although the animosities natural to faith\nhad all been lulled by the crisis, yet a look of anger had come into\nthe cat-like faces that no one dared disregard, and all perceived that\nif they stayed a moment longer there would be flaming around them the\njealousy of the gods; so each man hastily took his idols home, leaving\nthe fat man insisting that his hound-faced gods should be honoured.\n\nThen there were schemes again and voices raised in debate, and many\nnew dangers feared and new plans made.\n\nBut in the end they made no defence against danger, for they knew not\nwhat it would be, but wrote upon parchment as a warning, and in order\nthat all might know: \"_The bad old woman in black ran down the street\nof the ox-butchers._\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bird of the Difficult Eye\n\nObservant men and women that know their Bond Street well will\nappreciate my astonishment when in a jewellers' shop I perceived that\nnobody was furtively watching me. Not only this but when I even picked\nup a little carved crystal to examine it no shop-assistants crowded\nround me. I walked the whole length of the shop, still no one politely\nfollowed.\n\nSeeing from this that some extraordinary revolution had occurred in\nthe jewelry business I went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer\nold person half demon and half man who has an idol-shop in a byway of\nthe City and who keeps me informed of affairs at the Edge of the\nWorld. And briefly over a pinch of heather incense that he takes by\nway of snuff he gave me this tremendous information: that Mr. Neepy\nThang the son of Thangobrind had returned from the Edge of the World\nand was even now in London.\n\nThe information may not appear tremendous to those unacquainted with\nthe source of jewelry; but when I say that the only thief employed by\nany West-end jeweller since famous Thangobrind's distressing doom is\nthis same Neepy Thang, and that for lightness of fingers and swiftness\nof stockinged foot they have none better in Paris, it will be\nunderstood why the Bond Street jewellers no longer cared what became\nof their old stock.\n\nThere were big diamonds in London that summer and a few considerable\nsapphires. In certain astounding kingdoms behind the East strange\nsovereigns missed from their turbans the heirlooms of ancient wars,\nand here and there the keepers of crown jewels who had not heard the\nstockinged feet of Thang, were questioned and died slowly.\n\nAnd the jewellers gave a little dinner to Thang at the Hotel Great\nMagnificent; the windows had not been opened for five years and there\nwas wine at a guinea a bottle that you could not tell from champagne\nand cigars at half a crown with a Havana label. Altogether it was a\nsplendid evening for Thang.\n\nBut I have to tell of a far sadder thing than a dinner at a hotel. The\npublic require jewelry and jewelry must be obtained. I have to tell of\nNeepy Thang's last journey.\n\nThat year the fashion was emeralds. A man named Green had recently\ncrossed the Channel on a bicycle and the jewellers said that a green\nstone would be particularly appropriate to commemorate the event and\nrecommended emeralds.\n\nNow a certain money-lender of Cheapside who had just been made a peer\nhad divided his gains into three equal parts; one for the purchase of\nthe peerage, country house and park, and the twenty thousand pheasants\nthat are absolutely essential, and one for the upkeep of the position,\nwhile the third he banked abroad, partly to cheat the native\ntax-gatherer and partly because it seemed to him that the days of the\nPeerage were few and that he might at any moment be called upon to\nstart afresh elsewhere. In the upkeep of the position he included\njewelry for his wife and so it came about that Lord Castlenorman\nplaced an order with two well-known Bond-street jewellers named\nMessrs. Grosvenor and Campbell to the extent of \u00a3100,000 for a few\nreliable emeralds.\n\nBut the emeralds in stock were mostly small and shop-soiled and Neepy\nThang had to set out at once before he had had as much as a week in\nLondon. I will briefly sketch his project. Not many knew it, for where\nthe form of business is blackmail the fewer creditors you have the\nbetter (which of course in various degrees applies at all times).\n\nOn the shores of the risky seas of Shiroora Shan grows one tree only\nso that upon its branches if anywhere in the world there must build\nits nest the Bird of the Difficult Eye. Neepy Thang had come by this\ninformation, which was indeed the truth, that if the bird migrated to\nFairyland before the three eggs hatched out they would undoubtedly all\nturn into emeralds, while if they hatched out first it would be a bad\nbusiness.\n\nWhen he had mentioned these eggs to Messrs. Grosvenor and Campbell\nthey had said, \"The very thing\": they were men of few words, in\nEnglish, for it was not their native tongue.\n\nSo Neepy Thang set out. He bought the purple ticket at Victoria\nStation. He went by Herne Hill, Bromley and Bickley and passed St.\nMary Cray. At Eynsford he changed and taking a footpath along a\nwinding valley went wandering into the hills. And at the top of a hill\nin a little wood, where all the anemones long since were over and the\nperfume of mint and thyme from outside came drifting in with Thang, he\nfound once more the familiar path, age-old and fair as wonder, that\nleads to the Edge of the World. Little to him were its sacred memories\nthat are one with the secret of earth, for he was on business, and\nlittle would they be to me if I ever put them on paper. Let it suffice\nthat he went down that path going further and further from the fields\nwe know, and all the way he muttered to himself, \"What if the eggs\nhatch out and it be a bad business!\" The glamour that is at all times\nupon those lonely lands that lie at the back of the chalky hills of\nKent intensified as he went upon his journeys. Queerer and queerer\ngrew the things that he saw by little World-End Path. Many a twilight\ndescended upon that journey with all their mysteries, many a blaze of\nstars; many a morning came flaming up to a tinkle of silvern horns;\ntill the outpost elves of Fairyland came in sight and the glittering\ncrests of Fairyland's three mountains betokened the journey's end. And\nso with painful steps (for the shores of the world are covered with\nhuge crystals) he came to the risky seas of Shiroora Shan and saw them\npounding to gravel the wreckage of fallen stars, saw them and heard\ntheir roar, those shipless seas that between earth and the fairies'\nhomes heave beneath some huge wind that is none of our four. And there\nin the darkness on the grizzly coast, for darkness was swooping\nslantwise down the sky as though with some evil purpose, there stood\nthat lonely, gnarled and deciduous tree. It was a bad place to be\nfound in after dark, and night descended with multitudes of stars,\nbeasts prowling in the blackness gluttered [See any dictionary, but in\nvain.] at Neepy Thang. And there on a lower branch within easy reach\nhe clearly saw the Bird of the Difficult Eye sitting upon the nest for\nwhich she is famous. Her face was towards those three inscrutable\nmountains, far-off on the other side of the risky seas, whose hidden\nvalleys are Fairyland. Though not yet autumn in the fields we know, it\nwas close on midwinter here, the moment as Thang knew when those eggs\nhatch out. Had he miscalculated and arrived a minute too late? Yet the\nbird was even now about to migrate, her pinions fluttered and her gaze\nwas toward Fairyland. Thang hoped and muttered a prayer to those pagan\ngods whose spite and vengeance he had most reason to fear. It seems\nthat it was too late or a prayer too small to placate them, for there\nand then the stroke of midwinter came and the eggs hatched out in the\nroar of Shiroora Shan or ever the bird was gone with her difficult eye\nand it was a bad business indeed for Neepy Thang; I haven't the heart\nto tell you any more.\n\n\"'Ere,\" said Lord Castlenorman some few weeks later to Messrs.\nGrosvenor and Campbell, \"you aren't 'arf taking your time about those\nemeralds.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Long Porter's Tale\n\nThere are things that are known only to the long porter of Tong Tong\nTarrup as he sits and mumbles memories to himself in the little\nbastion gateway.\n\nHe remembers the war there was in the halls of the gnomes; and how the\nfairies came for the opals once, which Tong Tong Tarrup has; and the\nway that the giants went through the fields below, he watching from\nhis gateway: he remembers quests that are even yet a wonder to the\ngods. Who dwells in those frozen houses on the high bare brink of the\nworld not even he has told me, and he is held to be garrulous. Among\nthe elves, the only living things ever seen moving at that awful\naltitude where they quarry turquoise on Earth's highest crag, his name\nis a byword for loquacity wherewith they mock the talkative.\n\nHis favourite story if you offer him bash--the drug of which he is\nfondest, and for which he will give his service in war to the elves\nagainst the goblins, or vice-versa if the goblins bring him more--his\nfavourite story, when bodily soothed by the drug and mentally fiercely\nexcited, tells of a quest undertaken ever so long ago for nothing more\nmarketable than an old woman's song.\n\nPicture him telling it. An old man, lean and bearded, and almost\nmonstrously long, that lolled in a city's gateway on a crag perhaps\nten miles high; the houses for the most part facing eastward, lit by\nthe sun and moon and the constellations we know, but one house on the\npinnacle looking over the edge of the world and lit by the glimmer of\nthose unearthly spaces where one long evening wears away the stars: my\nlittle offering of bash; a long forefinger that nipped it at once on a\nstained and greedy thumb--all these are in the foreground of the\npicture. In the background, the mystery of those silent houses and of\nnot knowing who their denizens were, or what service they had at the\nhands of the long porter and what payment he had in return, and\nwhether he was mortal.\n\nPicture him in the gateway of this incredible town, having swallowed\nmy bash in silence, stretch his great length, lean back, and begin to\nspeak.\n\nIt seems that one clear morning a hundred years ago, a visitor to Tong\nTong Tarrup was climbing up from the world. He had already passed\nabove the snow and had set his foot on a step of the earthward\nstairway that goes down from Tong Tong Tarrup on to the rocks, when\nthe long porter saw him. And so painfully did he climb those easy\nsteps that the grizzled man on watch had long to wonder whether or not\nthe stranger brought him bash, the drug that gives a meaning to the\nstars and seems to explain the twilight. And in the end there was not\na scrap of bash, and the stranger had nothing better to offer that\ngrizzled man than his mere story only.\n\nIt seems that the stranger's name was Gerald Jones, and he always\nlived in London; but once as a child he had been on a Northern moor.\nIt was so long ago that he did not remember how, only somehow or other\nhe walked alone on the moor, and all the ling was in flower. There was\nnothing in sight but ling and heather and bracken, except, far off\nnear the sunset, on indistinct hills, there were little vague patches\nthat looked like the fields of men. With evening a mist crept up and\nhid the hills, and still he went walking on over the moor. And then he\ncame to the valley, a tiny valley in the midst of the moor, whose\nsides were incredibly steep. He lay down and looked at it through the\nroots of the ling. And a long, long way below him, in a garden by a\ncottage, with hollyhocks all round her that were taller than herself,\nthere sat an old woman on a wooden chair, singing in the evening. And\nthe man had taken a fancy to the song and remembered it after in\nLondon, and whenever it came to his mind it made him think of\nevenings--the kind you don't get in London--and he heard a soft wind\ngoing idly over the moor and the bumble-bees in a hurry, and forgot\nthe noise of the traffic. And always, whenever he heard men speak of\nTime, he grudged to Time most this song. Once afterwards he went to\nthat Northern moor again and found the tiny valley, but there was no\nold woman in the garden, and no one was singing a song. And either\nregret for the song that the old woman had sung, on a summer evening\ntwenty years away and daily receding, troubled his mind, or else the\nwearisome work that he did in London, for he worked for a great firm\nthat was perfectly useless; and he grew old early, as men do in\ncities. And at last, when melancholy brought only regret and the\nuselessness of his work gained round him with age, he decided to\nconsult a magician. So to a magician he went and told him his\ntroubles, and particularly he told him how he had heard the song. \"And\nnow,\" he said, \"it is nowhere in the world.\"\n\n\"Of course it is not in the world,\" the magician said, \"but over the\nEdge of the World you may easily find it.\" And he told the man that he\nwas suffering from flux of time and recommended a day at the Edge of\nthe World. Jones asked what part of the Edge of the World he should go\nto, and the magician had heard Tong Tong Tarrup well spoken of; so he\npaid him, as is usual, in opals, and started at once on the journey.\nThe ways to that town are winding; he took the ticket at Victoria\nStation that they only give if they know you: he went past Bleth: he\nwent along the Hills of Neol-Hungar and came to the Gap of Poy. All\nthese are in that part of the world that pertains to the fields we\nknow; but beyond the Gap of Poy on those ordinary plains, that so\nclosely resemble Sussex, one first meets the unlikely. A line of\ncommon grey hills, the Hills of Sneg, may be seen at the edge of the\nplain from the Gap of Poy; it is there that the incredible begins,\ninfrequently at first, but happening more and more as you go up the\nhills. For instance, descending once into Poy Plains, the first thing\nthat I saw was an ordinary shepherd watching a flock of ordinary\nsheep. I looked at them for some time and nothing happened, when,\nwithout a word, one of the sheep walked up to the shepherd and\nborrowed his pipe and smoked it--an incident that struck me as\nunlikely; but in the Hills of Sneg I met an honest politician. Over\nthese plains went Jones and over the Hills of Sneg, meeting at first\nunlikely things, and then incredible things, till he came to the long\nslope beyond the hills that leads up to the Edge of the World, and\nwhere, as all guidebooks tell, anything may happen. You might at the\nfoot of this slope see here and there things that could conceivably\noccur in the fields we know; but soon these disappeared, and the\ntraveller saw nothing but fabulous beasts, browsing on flowers as\nastounding as themselves, and rocks so distorted that their shapes had\nclearly a meaning, being too startling to be accidental. Even the\ntrees were shockingly unfamiliar, they had so much to say, and they\nleant over to one another whenever they spoke and struck grotesque\nattitudes and leered. Jones saw two fir-trees fighting. The effect of\nthese scenes on his nerves was very severe; still he climbed on, and\nwas much cheered at last by the sight of a primrose, the only familiar\nthing he had seen for hours, but it whistled and skipped away. He saw\nthe unicorns in their secret valley. Then night in a sinister way\nslipped over the sky, and there shone not only the stars, but lesser\nand greater moons, and he heard dragons rattling in the dark.\n\nWith dawn there appeared above him among its amazing crags the town of\nTong Tong Tarrup, with the light on its frozen stairs, a tiny cluster\nof houses far up in the sky. He was on the steep mountain now: great\nmists were leaving it slowly, and revealing, as they trailed away,\nmore and more astonishing things. Before the mist had all gone he\nheard quite near him, on what he had thought was bare mountain, the\nsound of a heavy galloping on turf. He had come to the plateau of the\ncentaurs. And all at once he saw them in the mist: there they were,\nthe children of fable, five enormous centaurs. Had he paused on\naccount of any astonishment he had not come so far: he strode on over\nthe plateau, and came quite near to the centaurs. It is never the\ncentaurs' wont to notice men; they pawed the ground and shouted to one\nanother in Greek, but they said no word to him. Nevertheless they\nturned and stared at him when he left them, and when he had crossed\nthe plateau and still went on, all five of them cantered after to the\nedge of their green land; for above the high green plateau of the\ncentaurs is nothing but naked mountains, and the last green thing that\nis seen by the mountaineer as he travels to Tong Tong Tarrup is the\ngrass that the centaurs trample. He came into the snow fields that the\nmountain wears like a cape, its head being bare above it, and still\nclimbed on. The centaurs watched him with increasing wonder.\n\nNot even fabulous beasts were near him now, nor strange demoniac\ntrees--nothing but snow and the clean bare crag above it on which was\nTong Tong Tarrup. All day he climbed and evening found him above the\nsnow-line; and soon he came to the stairway cut in the rock and in\nsight of that grizzled man, the long porter of Tong Tong Tarrup,\nsitting mumbling amazing memories to himself and expecting in vain\nfrom the stranger a gift of bash.\n\nIt seems that as soon as the stranger arrived at the bastion gateway,\ntired though he was, he demanded lodgings at once that commanded a\ngood view of the Edge of the World. But the long porter, that grizzled\nman, disappointed of his bash, demanded the stranger's story to add to\nhis memories before he would show him the way. And this is the story,\nif the long porter has told me the truth and if his memory is still\nwhat it was. And when the story was told, the grizzled man arose, and,\ndangling his musical keys, went up through door after door and by many\nstairs and led the stranger to the top-most house, the highest roof in\nthe world, and in its parlour showed him the parlour window. There the\ntired stranger sat down in a chair and gazed out of the window sheer\nover the Edge of the World. The window was shut, and in its glittering\npanes the twilight of the World's Edge blazed and danced, partly like\nglow-worms' lamps and partly like the sea; it went by rippling, full\nof wonderful moons. But the traveller did not look at the wonderful\nmoons. For from the abyss there grew with their roots in far\nconstellations a row of hollyhocks, and amongst them a small green\ngarden quivered and trembled as scenes tremble in water; higher up,\nling in bloom was floating upon the twilight, more and more floated up\ntill all the twilight was purple; the little green garden low down was\nhung in the midst of it. And the garden down below, and the ling all\nround it, seemed all to be trembling and drifting on a song. For the\ntwilight was full of a song that sang and rang along the edges of the\nWorld, and the green garden and the ling seemed to flicker and ripple\nwith it as the song rose and fell, and an old woman was singing it\ndown in the garden. A bumble-bee sailed across from over the Edge of\nthe World. And the song that was lapping there against the coasts of\nthe World, and to which the stars were dancing, was the same that he\nhad heard the old woman sing long since down in the valley in the\nmidst of the Northern moor.\n\nBut that grizzled man, the long porter, would not let the stranger\nstay, because he brought him no bash, and impatiently he shouldered\nhim away, himself not troubling to glance through the World's\noutermost window, for the lands that Time afflicts and the spaces that\nTime knows not are all one to that grizzled man, and the bash that he\neats more profoundly astounds his mind than anything man can show him\neither in the World we know or over the Edge. And, bitterly\nprotesting, the traveller went back and down again to the World.\n\n                      .     .     .     .     .\n\nAccustomed as I am to the incredible from knowing the Edge of the\nWorld, the story presents difficulties to me. Yet it may be that the\ndevastation wrought by Time is merely local, and that outside the\nscope of his destruction old songs are still being sung by those that\nwe deem dead. I try to hope so. And yet the more I investigate the\nstory that the long porter told me in the town of Tong Tong Tarrup the\nmore plausible the alternative theory appears--that that grizzled man\nis a liar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Loot of Loma\n\nComing back laden with the loot of Loma, the four tall men looked\nearnestly to the right; to the left they durst not, for the precipice\nthere that had been with them so long went sickly down on to a bank of\nclouds, and how much further below that only their fears could say.\n\nLoma lay smoking, a city of ruin, behind them, all its defenders dead;\nthere was no one left to pursue them, and yet their Indian instincts\ntold them that all was scarcely well. They had gone three days along\nthat narrow ledge: mountain quite smooth, incredible, above them, and\nprecipice as smooth and as far below. It was chilly there in the\nmountains; at night a stream or a wind in the gloom of the chasm below\nthem went like a whisper; the stillness of all things else began to\nwear the nerve--an enemy's howl would have braced them; they began to\nwish their perilous path were wider, they began to wish that they had\nnot sacked Loma.\n\nHad that path been any wider the sacking of Loma must indeed have been\nharder for them, for the citizens must have fortified the city but\nthat the awful narrowness of that ten-league pass of the hills had\nmade their crag-surrounded city secure. And at last an Indian had\nsaid, \"Come, let us sack it.\" Grimly they laughed in the wigwams. Only\nthe eagles, they said, had ever seen it, its hoard of emeralds and its\ngolden gods; and one had said he would reach it, and they answered,\n\"Only the eagles.\"\n\nIt was Laughing Face who said it, and who gathered thirty braves and\nled them into Loma with their tomahawks and their bows; there were\nonly four left now, but they had the loot of Loma on a mule. They had\nfour golden gods, a hundred emeralds, fifty-two rubies, a large silver\ngong, two sticks of malachite with amethyst handles for holding\nincense at religious feasts, four beakers one foot high, each carved\nfrom a rose-quartz crystal; a little coffer carved out of two\ndiamonds, and (had they but known it) the written curse of a priest.\nIt was written on parchment in an unknown tongue, and had been slipped\nin with the loot by a dying hand.\n\nFrom either end of that narrow, terrible ledge the third night was\nclosing in; it was dropping down on them from the heights of the\nmountain and slipping up to them out of the abyss, the third night\nsince Loma blazed and they had left it. Three more days of tramping\nshould bring them in triumph home, and yet their instincts said that\nall was scarcely well. We who sit at home and draw the blinds and shut\nthe shutters as soon as night appears, who gather round the fire when\nthe wind is wild, who pray at regular seasons and in familiar shrines,\nknow little of the demoniac look of night when it is filled with\ncurses of false, infuriated gods. Such a night was this. Though in the\nheights the fleecy clouds were idle, yet the wind was stirring\nmournfully in the abyss and moaning as it stirred, unhappily at first\nand full of sorrow; but as day turned away from that awful path a very\ndefinite menace entered its voice which fast grew louder and louder,\nand night came on with a long howl. Shadows repeatedly passed over the\nstars, and then a mist fell swiftly, as though there were something\nsuddenly to be done and utterly to be hidden, as in very truth there\nwas.\n\nAnd in the chill of that mist the four tall men prayed to their\ntotems, the whimsical wooden figures that stood so far away, watching\nthe pleasant wigwams; the firelight even now would be dancing over\ntheir faces, while there would come to their ears delectable tales of\nwar. They halted upon the pass and prayed, and waited for any sign.\nFor a man's totem may be in the likeness perhaps of an otter, and a\nman may pray, and if his totem be placable and watching over his man a\nnoise may be heard at once like the noise that the otter makes, though\nit be but a stone that falls on another stone; and the noise is a\nsign. The four men's totems that stood so far away were in the\nlikeness of the coney, the bear, the heron, and the lizard. They\nwaited, and no sign came. With all the noises of the wind in the\nabyss, no noise was like the thump that the coney makes, nor the\nbear's growl, nor the heron's screech, nor the rustle of the lizard in\nthe reeds.\n\nIt seemed that the wind was saying something over and over again, and\nthat that thing was evil. They prayed again to their totems, and no\nsign came. And then they knew that there was some power that night\nthat was prevailing against the pleasant carvings on painted poles of\nwood with the firelight on their faces so far away. Now it was clear\nthat the wind was saying something, some very, very dreadful thing in\na tongue that they did not know. They listened, but they could not\ntell what it said. Nobody could have said from seeing their faces how\nmuch the four tall men desired the wigwams again, desired the\ncamp-fire and the tales of war and the benignant totems that listened\nand smiled in the dusk: nobody could have seen how well they knew that\nthis was no common night or wholesome mist.\n\nWhen at last no answer came nor any sign from their totems, they\npulled out of the bag those golden gods that Loma gave not up except\nin flames and when all her men were dead. They had large ruby eyes and\nemerald tongues. They set them down upon that mountain pass, the\ncross-legged idols with their emerald tongues; and having placed\nbetween them a few decent yards, as it seemed meet there should be\nbetween gods and men, they bowed them down and prayed in their\ndesperate straits in that dank, ominous night to the gods they had\nwronged, for it seemed that there was a vengeance upon the hills and\nthat they would scarce escape, as the wind knew well. And the gods\nlaughed, all four, and wagged their emerald tongues; the Indians saw\nthem, though the night had fallen and though the mist was low. The\nfour tall men leaped up at once from their knees and would have left\nthe gods upon the pass but that they feared some hunter of their tribe\nmight one day find them and say of Laughing Face, \"He fled and left\nbehind his golden gods,\" and sell the gold and come with his wealth to\nthe wigwams and be greater than Laughing Face and his three men. And\nthen they would have cast the gods away, down the abyss, with their\neyes and their emerald tongues, but they knew that enough already they\nhad wronged Loma's gods, and feared that vengeance enough was waiting\nthem on the hills. So they packed them back in the bag on the\nfrightened mule, the bag that held the curse they knew nothing of, and\nso pushed on into the menacing night. Till midnight they plodded on\nand would not sleep; grimmer and grimmer grew the look of the night,\nand the wind more full of meaning, and the mule knew and trembled, and\nit seemed that the wind knew, too, as did the instincts of those four\ntall men, though they could not reason it out, try how they would.\n\nAnd though the squaws waited long where the pass winds out of the\nmountains, near where the wigwams are upon the plains, the wigwams and\nthe totems and the fire, and though they watched by day, and for many\nnights uttered familiar calls, still did they never see those four\ntall men emerge out of the mountains any more, even though they prayed\nto their totems upon their painted poles; but the curse in the\nmystical writing that they had unknown in their bag worked there on\nthat lonely pass six leagues from the ruins of Loma, and nobody can\ntell us what it was.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Secret of the Sea\n\nIn an ill-lit ancient tavern that I know, are many tales of the sea;\nbut not without the wine of Gorgondy, that I had of a private bargain\nfrom the gnomes, was the tale laid bare for which I had waited of an\nevening for the greater part of a year.\n\nI knew my man and listened to his stories, sitting amid the bluster of\nhis oaths; I plied him with rum and whiskey and mixed drinks, but\nthere never came the tale for which I sought, and as a last resort I\nwent to the Huthneth Mountains and bargained there all night with the\nchiefs of the gnomes.\n\nWhen I came to the ancient tavern and entered the low-roofed room,\nbringing the hoard of the gnomes in a bottle of hammered iron, my man\nhad not yet arrived. The sailors laughed at my old iron bottle, but I\nsat down and waited; had I opened it then they would have wept and\nsung. I was well content to wait, for I knew my man had the story, and\nit was such a one as had profoundly stirred the incredulity of the\nfaithless.\n\nHe entered and greeted me, and sat down and called for brandy. He was\na hard man to turn from his purpose, and, uncorking my iron bottle, I\nsought to dissuade him from brandy for fear that when the brandy, bit\nhis throat he should refuse to leave it for any other wine. He lifted\nhis head and said deep and dreadful things of any man that should dare\nto speak against brandy.\n\nI swore that I said nothing against brandy but added that it was often\ngiven to children, while Gorgondy was only drunk by men of such\ndepravity that they had abandoned sin because all the usual vices had\ncome to seem genteel. When he asked if Gorgondy was a bad wine to\ndrink I said that it was so bad that if a man sipped it that was the\none touch that made damnation certain. Then he asked me what I had in\nthe iron bottle, and I said it was Gorgondy; and then he shouted for\nthe largest tumbler in that ill-lit ancient tavern, and stood up and\nshook his fist at me when it came, and swore, and told me to fill it\nwith the wine that I got on that bitter night from the treasure house\nof the gnomes.\n\nAs he drank it he told me that he had met men who had spoken against\nwine, and that they had mentioned Heaven; and therefore he would not\ngo there--no, not he; and that once he had sent one of them to Hell,\nbut when he got there he would turn him out, and he had no use for\nmilksops.\n\nOver the second tumbler he was thoughtful, but still he said no word\nof the tale he knew, until I feared that it would never be heard. But\nwhen the third glass of that terrific wine had burned its way down his\ngullet, and vindicated the wickedness of the gnomes, his reticence\nwithered like a leaf in the fire, and he bellowed out the secret.\n\nI had long known that there is in ships a will or way of their own,\nand had even suspected that when sailors die or abandon their ships at\nsea, a derelict, being left to her own devices, may seek her own ends;\nbut I had never dreamed by night, or fancied during the day, that the\nships had a god that they worshipped, or that they secretly slipped\naway to a temple in the sea.\n\nOver the fourth glass of the wine that the gnomes so sinfully brew but\nhave kept so wisely from man, until the bargain that I had with their\nelders all through that autumn night, the sailor told me the story. I\ndo not tell it as he told it to me because of the oaths that were in\nit; nor is it from delicacy that I refrain from writing these oaths\nverbatim, but merely because the horror they caused in me at the time\ntroubles me still whenever I put them on paper, and I continue to\nshudder until I have blotted them out. Therefore, I tell the story in\nmy own words, which, if they possess a certain decency that was not in\nthe mouth of that sailor, unfortunately do not smack, as his did, of\nrum and blood and the sea.\n\nYou would take a ship to be a dead thing like a table, as dead as bits\nof iron and canvas and wood. That is because you always live on shore,\nand have never seen the sea, and drink milk. Milk is a more accursed\ndrink than water.\n\nWhat with the captain and what with the man at the wheel, and what\nwith the crew, a ship has no fair chance of showing a will of her own.\n\nThere is only one moment in the history of ships, that carry crews on\nboard, when they act by their own free will. This moment comes when\nall the crew are drunk. As the last man falls drunk on to the deck,\nthe ship is free of man, and immediately slips away. She slips away at\nonce on a new course and is never one yard out in a hundred miles.\n\nIt was like this one night with the Sea-Fancy. Bill Smiles was there\nhimself, and can vouch for it. Bill Smiles has never told this tale\nbefore for fear that anyone should call him a liar. Nobody dislikes\nbeing hung as much as Bill Smiles would, but he won't be called a\nliar. I tell the tale as I heard it, relevancies and irrelevancies,\nthough in my more decent words; and as I made no doubts of the truth\nof it then, I hardly like to now; others can please themselves.\n\nIt is not often that the whole of a crew is drunk. The crew of\nthe Sea-Fancy was no drunkener than others. It happened like this.\n\nThe captain was always drunk. One day a fancy he had that some spiders\nwere plotting against him, or a sudden bleeding he had from both his\nears, made him think that drinking might be bad for his health. Next\nday he signed the pledge. He was sober all that morning and all the\nafternoon, but at evening he saw a sailor drinking a a glass of beer,\nand a fit of madness seized him, and he said things that seemed bad to\nBill Smiles. And next morning he made all of them take the pledge.\n\nFor two days nobody had a drop to drink, unless you count water, and\non the third morning the captain was quite drunk. It stood to reason\nthey all had a glass or two then, except the man at the wheel; and\ntowards evening the man at the wheel could bear it no longer, and\nseems to have had his glass like all the rest, for the ship's course\nwobbled a bit and made a circle or two. Then all of a sudden she went\noff south by east under full canvas till midnight, and never altered\nher course. And at midnight she came to the wide wet courts of the\nTemple in the Sea.\n\nPeople who think that Mr. Smiles is drunk often make a great mistake. And\npeople are not the only ones that have made that mistake. Once a\nship made it, and a lot of ships. It's a mistake to think that old Bill\nSmiles is drunk just because he can't move.\n\nMidnight and moonlight and the Temple in the Sea Bill Smiles clearly\nremembers, and all the derelicts in the world were there, the old\nabandoned ships. The figureheads were nodding to themselves and\nblinking at the image. The image was a woman of white marble on a\npedestal in the outer court of the Temple of the Sea: she was clearly\nthe love of all the man-deserted ships, or the goddess to whom they\nprayed their heathen prayers. And as Bill Smiles was watching them,\nthe lips of the figureheads moved; they all began to pray. But all at\nonce their lips were closed with a snap when they saw that there were\nmen on the Sea-Fancy. They all came crowding up and nodded and nodded\nand nodded to see if all were drunk, and that's when they made their\nmistake about old Bill Smiles, although he couldn't move. They would\nhave given up the treasuries of the gulfs sooner than let men hear the\nprayers they said or guess their love for the goddess. It is the\nintimate secret of the sea.\n\nThe sailor paused. And, in my eagerness to hear what lyrical or\nblasphemous thing those figureheads prayed by moonlight at midnight in\nthe sea to the woman of marble who was a goddess to ships, I pressed\non the sailor more of my Gorgondy wine that the gnomes so wickedly\nbrew.\n\nI should never have done it; but there he was sitting silent while the\nsecret was almost mine. He took it moodily and drank a glass; and with\nthe other glasses that he had had he fell a prey to the villainy of\nthe gnomes who brew this unbridled wine to no good end. His body\nleaned forward slowly, then fell on to the table, his face being\nsideways and full of a wicked smile, and, saying very clearly the one\nword, \"Hell,\" he became silent for ever with the secret he had from\nthe sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Ali Came to the Black Country\n\nShooshan the barber went to Shep the maker of teeth to discuss the\nstate of England. They agreed that it was time to send for Ali.\n\nSo Shooshan stepped late that night from the little shop near Fleet\nStreet and made his way back again to his house in the ends of London\nand sent at once the message that brought Ali.\n\nAnd Ali came, mostly on foot, from the country of Persia, and it took\nhim a year to come; but when he came he was welcome.\n\nAnd Shep told Ali what was the matter with England and Shooshan swore\nthat it was so, and Ali looking out of the window of the little shop\nnear Fleet Street beheld the ways of London and audibly blessed King\nSolomon and his seal.\n\nWhen Shep and Shooshan heard the names of King Solomon and his seal\nboth asked, as they had scarcely dared before, if Ali had it. Ali\npatted a little bundle of silks that he drew from his inner raiment.\nIt was there.\n\nNow concerning the movements and courses of the stars and the\ninfluence on them of spirits of Earth and devils this age has been\nrightly named by some The Second Age of Ignorance. But Ali knew. And\nby watching nightly, for seven nights in Bagdad, the way of certain\nstars he had found out the dwelling place of Him they Needed.\n\nGuided by Ali all three set forth for the Midlands. And by the\nreverence that was manifest in the faces of Shep and Shooshan towards\nthe person of Ali, some knew what Ali carried, while others said that\nit was the tablets of the Law, others the name of God, and others that\nhe must have a lot of money about him. So they passed Slod and Apton.\n\nAnd at last they came to the town for which Ali sought, that spot over\nwhich he had seen the shy stars wheel and swerve away from their\norbits, being troubled. Verily when they came there were no stars,\nthough it was midnight. And Ali said that it was the appointed place.\nIn harems in Persia in the evening when the tales go round it is still\ntold how Ali and Shep and Shooshan came to the Black country.\n\nWhen it was dawn they looked upon the country and saw how it was\nwithout doubt the appointed place, even as Ali had said, for the earth\nhad been taken out of pits and burned and left lying in heaps, and\nthere were many factories, and they stood over the town and as it were\nrejoiced. And with one voice Shep and Shooshan gave praise to Ali.\n\nAnd Ali said that the great ones of the place must needs be gathered\ntogether, and to this end Shep and Shooshan went into the town and\nthere spoke craftily. For they said that Ali had of his wisdom\ncontrived as it were a patent and a novelty which should greatly\nbenefit England. And when they heard how he sought nothing for his\nnovelty save only to benefit mankind they consented to speak with Ali\nand see his novelty. And they came forth and met Ali.\n\nAnd Ali spake and said unto them: \"O lords of this place; in the book\nthat all men know it is written how that a fisherman casting his net\ninto the sea drew up a bottle of brass, and when he took the stopper\nfrom the bottle a dreadful genie of horrible aspect rose from the\nbottle, as it were like a smoke, even to darkening the sky, whereat\nthe fisherman...\" And the great ones of that place said: \"We have\nheard the story.\" And Ali said: \"What became of that genie after he\nwas safely thrown back into the sea is not properly spoken of by any\nsave those that pursue the study of demons and not with certainty by\nany man, but that the stopper that bore the ineffable seal and bears\nit to this day became separate from the bottle is among those things\nthat man may know.\" And when there was doubt among the great ones Ali\ndrew forth his bundle and one by one removed those many silks till the\nseal stood revealed; and some of them knew it for the seal and others\nknew it not.\n\nAnd they looked curiously at it and listened to Ali, and Ali said:\n\n\"Having heard how evil is the case of England, how a smoke has\ndarkened the country, and in places (as men say) the grass is black,\nand how even yet your factories multiply, and haste and noise have\nbecome such that men have no time for song, I have therefore come at\nthe bidding of my good friend Shooshan, barber of London, and of Shep,\na maker of teeth, to make things well with you.\"\n\nAnd they said: \"But where is your patent and your novelty?\"\n\nAnd Ali said: \"Have I not here the stopper and on it, as good men\nknow, the ineffable seal? Now I have learned in Persia how that your\ntrains that make the haste, and hurry men to and fro, and your\nfactories and the digging of your pits and all the things that are\nevil are everyone of them caused and brought about by steam.\"\n\n\"Is it not so?\" said Shooshan.\n\n\"It is even so,\" said Shep.\n\n\"Now it is clear,\" said Ali, \"that the chief devil that vexes England\nand has done all this harm, who herds men into cities and will not let\nthem rest, is even the devil Steam.\"\n\nThen the great ones would have rebuked him but one said: \"No, let us\nhear him, perhaps his patent may improve on steam.\"\n\nAnd to them hearkening Ali went on thus: \"O Lords of this place, let\nthere be made a bottle of strong steel, for I have no bottle with my\nstopper, and this being done let all the factories, trains, digging of\npits, and all evil things soever that may be done by steam be stopped\nfor seven days, and the men that tend them shall go free, but the\nsteel bottle for my stopper I will leave open in a likely place. Now\nthat chief devil, Steam, finding no factories to enter into, nor no\ntrains, sirens nor pits prepared for him, and being curious and\naccustomed to steel pots, will verily enter one night into the bottle\nthat you shall make for my stopper, and I shall spring forth from my\nhiding with my stopper and fasten him down with the ineffable seal\nwhich is the seal of King Solomon and deliver him up to you that you\ncast him into the sea.\"\n\nAnd the great ones answered Ali and they said: \"But what should we\ngain if we lose our prosperity and be no longer rich?\"\n\nAnd Ali said: \"When we have cast this devil into the sea there will\ncome back again the woods and ferns and all the beautiful things that\nthe world hath, the little leaping hares shall be seen at play, there\nshall be music on the hills again, and at twilight ease and quiet and\nafter the twilight stars.\"\n\nAnd \"Verily,\" said Shooshan, \"there shall be the dance again.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Shep, \"there shall be the country dance.\"\n\nBut the great ones spake and said, denying Ali: \"We will make no such\nbottle for your stopper nor stop our healthy factories or good trains,\nnor cease from our digging of pits nor do anything that you desire,\nfor an interference with steam would strike at the roots of that\nprosperity that you see so plentifully all around us.\"\n\nThus they dismissed Ali there and then from that place where the earth\nwas torn up and burnt, being taken out of pits, and where factories\nblazed all night with a demoniac glare; and they dismissed with him\nboth Shooshan, the barber, and Shep, the maker of teeth: so that a\nweek later Ali started from Calais on his long walk back to Persia.\n\nAnd all this happened thirty years ago, and Shep is an old man now and\nShooshan older, and many mouths have bit with the teeth of Shep (for\nhe has a knack of getting them back whenever his customers die), and\nthey have written again to Ali away in the country of Persia with\nthese words, saying:\n\n\"O Ali. The devil has indeed begotten a devil, even that spirit\nPetrol. And the young devil waxeth, and increaseth in lustihood and is\nten years old and becoming like to his father. Come therefore and help\nus with the ineffable seal. For there is none like Ali.\"\n\nAnd Ali turns where his slaves scatter rose-leaves, letting the letter\nfall, and deeply draws from his hookah a puff of the scented smoke,\nright down into his lungs, and sighs it forth and smiles, and lolling\nround on to his other elbow speaks comfortably and says, \"And shall a\nman go twice to the help of a dog?\"\n\nAnd with these words he thinks no more of England but ponders again\nthe inscrutable ways of God.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bureau d'Echange de Maux\n\nI often think of the Bureau d'Echange de Maux and the wondrously evil\nold man that sate therein. It stood in a little street that there is\nin Paris, its doorway made of three brown beams of wood, the top one\noverlapping the others like the Greek letter _pi_, all the rest\npainted green, a house far lower and narrower than its neighbours and\ninfinitely stranger, a thing to take one's fancy. And over the doorway\non the old brown beam in faded yellow letters this legend ran, Bureau\nUniversel d'Echanges de Maux.\n\nI entered at once and accosted the listless man that lolled on a stool\nby his counter. I demanded the wherefore of his wonderful house, what\nevil wares he exchanged, with many other things that I wished to know,\nfor curiosity led me; and indeed had it not I had gone at once from\nthat shop, for there was so evil a look in that fattened man, in the\nhang of his fallen cheeks and his sinful eye, that you would have said\nhe had had dealings with Hell and won the advantage by sheer\nwickedness.\n\nSuch a man was mine host; but above all the evil of him lay in his\neyes, which lay so still, so apathetic, that you would have sworn that\nhe was drugged or dead; like lizards motionless on a wall they lay,\nthen suddenly they darted, and all his cunning flamed up and revealed\nitself in what one moment before seemed no more than a sleepy and\nordinary wicked old man. And this was the object and trade of that\npeculiar shop, the Bureau Universel d'Echange de Maux: you paid twenty\nfrancs, which the old man proceeded to take from me, for admission to\nthe bureau and then had the right to exchange any evil or misfortune\nwith anyone on the premises for some evil or misfortune that he \"could\nafford,\" as the old man put it.\n\nThere were four or five men in the dingy ends of that low-ceilinged\nroom who gesticulated and muttered softly in twos as men who make a\nbargain, and now and then more came in, and the eyes of the flabby\nowner of the house leaped up at them as they entered, seemed to know\ntheir errands at once and each one's peculiar need, and fell back\nagain into somnolence, receiving his twenty francs in an almost\nlifeless hand and biting the coin as though in pure absence of mind.\n\n\"Some of my clients,\" he told me. So amazing to me was the trade of\nthis extraordinary shop that I engaged the old man in conversation,\nrepulsive though he was, and from his garrulity I gathered these\nfacts. He spoke in perfect English though his utterance was somewhat\nthick and heavy; no language seemed to come amiss to him. He had been\nin business a great many years, how many he would not say, and was far\nolder than he looked. All kinds of people did business in his shop.\nWhat they exchanged with each other he did not care except that it had\nto be evils, he was not empowered to carry on any other kind of\nbusiness.\n\nThere was no evil, he told me, that was not negotiable there; no evil\nthe old man knew had ever been taken away in despair from his shop. A\nman might have to wait and come back again next day, and next day and\nthe day after, paying twenty francs each time, but the old man had the\naddresses of all his clients and shrewdly knew their needs, and soon\nthe right two met and eagerly exchanged their commodities.\n\"Commodities\" was the old man's terrible word, said with a gruesome\nsmack of his heavy lips, for he took a pride in his business and evils\nto him were goods.\n\nI learned from him in ten minutes very much of human nature, more than\nI have ever learned from any other man; I learned from him that a\nman's own evil is to him the worst thing there is or ever could be,\nand that an evil so unbalances all men's minds that they always seek\nfor extremes in that small grim shop. A woman that had no children had\nexchanged with an impoverished half-maddened creature with twelve. On\none occasion a man had exchanged wisdom for folly.\n\n\"Why on earth did he do that?\" I said.\n\n\"None of my business,\" the old man answered in his heavy indolent way.\nHe merely took his twenty francs from each and ratified the agreement\nin the little room at the back opening out of the shop where his\nclients do business. Apparently the man that had parted with wisdom\nhad left the shop upon the tips of his toes with a happy though\nfoolish expression all over his face, but the other went thoughtfully\naway wearing a troubled and very puzzled look. Almost always it seemed\nthey did business in opposite evils.\n\nBut the thing that puzzled me most in all my talks with that unwieldy\nman, the thing that puzzles me still, is that none that had once done\nbusiness in that shop ever returned again; a man might come day after\nday for many weeks, but once do business and he never returned; so\nmuch the old man told me, but when I asked him why, he only muttered\nthat he did not know.\n\nIt was to discover the wherefore of this strange thing and for no\nother reason at all that I determined myself to do business sooner or\nlater in the little room at the back of that mysterious shop. I\ndetermined to exchange some very trivial evil for some evil equally\nslight, to seek for myself an advantage so very small as scarcely to\ngive Fate as it were a grip, for I deeply distrusted these bargains,\nknowing well that man has never yet benefited by the marvellous and\nthat the more miraculous his advantage appears to be the more securely\nand tightly do the gods or the witches catch him. In a few days more I\nwas going back to England and I was beginning to fear that I should be\nsea-sick: this fear of sea-sickness, not the actual malady but only\nthe mere fear of it, I decided to exchange for a suitably little evil.\nI did not know with whom I should be dealing, who in reality was the\nhead of the firm (one never does when shopping) but I decided that\nneither Jew nor Devil could make very much on so small a bargain as\nthat.\n\nI told the old man my project, and he scoffed at the smallness of my\ncommodity trying to urge me to some darker bargain, but could not move\nme from my purpose. And then he told me tales with a somewhat boastful\nair of the big business, the great bargains that had passed through\nhis hands. A man had once run in there to try and exchange death, he\nhad swallowed poison by accident and had only twelve hours to live.\nThat sinister old man had been able to oblige him. A client was\nwilling to exchange the commodity.\n\n\"But what did he give in exchange for death?\" I said.\n\n\"Life,\" said that grim old man with a furtive chuckle.\n\n\"It must have been a horrible life,\" I said.\n\n\"That was not my affair,\" the proprietor said, lazily rattling\ntogether as he spoke a little pocketful of twenty-franc pieces.\n\nStrange business I watched in that shop for the next few days, the\nexchange of odd commodities, and heard strange mutterings in corners\namongst couples who presently rose and went to the back room, the old\nman following to ratify.\n\nTwice a day for a week I paid my twenty francs, watching life with its\ngreat needs and its little needs morning and afternoon spread out\nbefore me in all its wonderful variety.\n\nAnd one day I met a comfortable man with only a little need, he seemed\nto have the very evil I wanted. He always feared the lift was going to\nbreak. I knew too much of hydraulics to fear things as silly as that,\nbut it was not my business to cure his ridiculous fear. Very few words\nwere needed to convince him that mine was the evil for him, he never\ncrossed the sea, and I on the other hand could always walk upstairs,\nand I also felt at the time, as many must feel in that shop, that so\nabsurd a fear could never trouble me. And yet at times it is almost\nthe curse of my life. When we both had signed the parchment in the\nspidery back room and the old man had signed and ratified (for which\nwe had to pay him fifty francs each) I went back to my hotel, and\nthere I saw the deadly thing in the basement. They asked me if I would\ngo upstairs in the lift, from force of habit I risked it, and I held\nmy breath all the way and clenched my hands. Nothing will induce me to\ntry such a journey again. I would sooner go up to my room in a\nballoon. And why? Because if a balloon goes wrong you have a chance,\nit may spread out into a parachute after it has burst, it may catch in\na tree, a hundred and one things may happen, but if the lift falls\ndown its shaft you are done. As for sea-sickness I shall never be sick\nagain, I cannot tell you why except that I know that it is so.\n\nAnd the shop in which I made this remarkable bargain, the shop to\nwhich none return when their business is done: I set out for it next\nday. Blindfold I could have found my way to the unfashionable quarter\nout of which a mean street runs, where you take the alley at the end,\nwhence runs the cul de sac where the queer shop stood. A shop with\npillars, fluted and painted red, stands on its near side, its other\nneighbour is a low-class jeweller's with little silver brooches in the\nwindow. In such incongruous company stood the shop with beams with its\nwalls painted green.\n\nIn half an hour I found the cul de sac to which I had gone twice a day\nfor the last week, I found the shop with the ugly painted pillars and\nthe jeweller that sold brooches, but the green house with the three\nbeams was gone.\n\nPulled down, you will say, although in a single night. That can never\nbe the answer to the mystery, for the house of the fluted pillars\npainted on plaster and the low-class jeweller's shop with its silver\nbrooches (all of which I could identify one by one) were standing side\nby side.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Story of Land and Sea\n\nIt is written in the first Book of Wonder how Captain Shard of the bad\nship Desperate Lark, having looted the sea-coast city Bombasharna,\nretired from active life; and resigning piracy to younger men, with\nthe good will of the North and South Atlantic, settled down with a\ncaptured queen on his floating island.\n\nSometimes he sank a ship for the sake of old times but he no longer\nhovered along the trade-routes; and timid merchants watched for other\nmen.\n\nIt was not age that caused him to leave his romantic profession; nor\nunworthiness of its traditions, nor gun-shot wound, nor drink; but\ngrim necessity and force majeure. Five navies were after him. How he\ngave them the slip one day in the Mediterranean, how he fought with\nthe Arabs, how a ship's broadside was heard in Lat. 23 N. Long. 4 E.\nfor the first time and the last, with other things unknown to\nAdmiralties, I shall proceed to tell.\n\nHe had had his fling, had Shard, captain of pirates, and all his merry\nmen wore pearls in their ear-rings; and now the English fleet was\nafter him under full sail along the coast of Spain with a good North\nwind behind them. They were not gaining much on Shard's rakish craft,\nthe bad ship Desperate Lark, yet they were closer than was to his\nliking, and they interfered with business.\n\nFor a day and a night they had chased him, when off Cape St. Vincent\nat about six a.m. Shard took that step that decided his retirement\nfrom active life, he turned for the Mediterranean. Had he held on\nSouthwards down the African coast it is doubtful whether in face of\nthe interference of England, Russia, France, Denmark and Spain, he\ncould have made piracy pay; but in turning for the Mediterranean he\ntook what we may call the penultimate step of his life which meant for\nhim settling down. There were three great courses of action invented\nby Shard in his youth, upon which he pondered by day and brooded by\nnight, consolations in all his dangers, secret even from his men,\nthree means of escape as he hoped from any peril that might meet him\non the sea. One of these was the floating island that the Book of\nWonder tells of, another was so fantastic that we may doubt if even\nthe brilliant audacity of Shard could ever have found it practicable,\nat least he never tried it so far as is known in that tavern by the\nsea in which I glean my news, and the third he determined on carrying\nout as he turned that morning for the Mediterranean. True he might yet\nhave practised piracy in spite of the step that he took, a little\nlater when the seas grew quiet, but that penultimate step was like\nthat small house in the country that the business man has his eye on,\nlike some snug investment put away for old age, there are certain\nfinal courses in men's lives which after taking they never go back to\nbusiness.\n\nHe turned then for the Mediterranean with the English fleet behind\nhim, and his men wondered.\n\nWhat madness was this,--muttered Bill the Boatswain in Old Frank's\nonly ear, with the French fleet waiting in the Gulf of Lyons and the\nSpaniards all the way between Sardinia and Tunis: for they knew the\nSpaniards' ways. And they made a deputation and waited upon Captain\nShard, all of them sober and wearing their costly clothes, and they\nsaid that the Mediterranean was a trap, and all he said was that the\nNorth wind should hold. And the crew said they were done.\n\nSo they entered the Mediterranean and the English fleet came up and\nclosed the straits. And Shard went tacking along the Moroccan coast\nwith a dozen frigates behind him. And the North wind grew in strength.\nAnd not till evening did he speak to his crew, and then he gathered\nthem all together except the man at the helm, and politely asked them\nto come down to the hold. And there he showed them six immense steel\naxles and a dozen low iron wheels of enormous width which none had\nseen before; and he told his crew how all unknown to the world his\nkeel had been specially fitted for these same axles and wheels, and\nhow he meant soon to sail to the wide Atlantic again, though not by\nthe way of the straits. And when they heard the name of the Atlantic\nall his merry men cheered, for they looked on the Atlantic as a wide\nsafe sea.\n\nAnd night came down and Captain Shard sent for his diver. With the sea\ngetting up it was hard work for the diver, but by midnight things were\ndone to Shard's satisfaction, and the diver said that of all the jobs\nhe had done--but finding no apt comparison, and being in need of a\ndrink, silence fell on him and soon sleep, and his comrades carried\nhim away to his hammock. All the next day the chase went on with the\nEnglish well in sight, for Shard had lost time overnight with his\nwheels and axles, and the danger of meeting the Spaniards increased\nevery hour; and evening came when every minute seemed dangerous, yet\nthey still went tacking on towards the East where they knew the\nSpaniards must be.\n\nAnd at last they sighted their topsails right ahead, and still Shard\nwent on. It was a close thing, but night was coming on, and the Union\nJack which he hoisted helped Shard with the Spaniards for the last few\nanxious minutes, though it seemed to anger the English, but as Shard\nsaid, \"There's no pleasing everyone,\" and then the twilight shivered\ninto darkness.\n\n\"Hard to starboard,\" said Captain Shard.\n\nThe North wind which had risen all day was now blowing a gale. I do\nnot know what part of the coast Shard steered for, but Shard knew, for\nthe coasts of the world were to him what Margate is to some of us.\n\nAt a place where the desert rolling up from mystery and from death,\nyea, from the heart of Africa, emerges upon the sea, no less grand\nthan her, no less terrible, even there they sighted the land quite\nclose, almost in darkness. Shard ordered every man to the hinder part\nof the ship and all the ballast too; and soon the Desperate Lark, her\nprow a little high out of the water, doing her eighteen knots before\nthe wind, struck a sandy beach and shuddered, she heeled over a\nlittle, then righted herself, and slowly headed into the interior of\nAfrica.\n\nThe men would have given three cheers, but after the first Shard\nsilenced them and, steering the ship himself, he made them a short\nspeech while the broad wheels pounded slowly over the African sand,\ndoing barely five knots in a gale. The perils of the sea he said had\nbeen greatly exaggerated. Ships had been sailing the sea for hundreds\nof years and at sea you knew what to do, but on land this was\ndifferent. They were on land now and they were not to forget it. At\nsea you might make as much noise as you pleased and no harm was done,\nbut on land anything might happen. One of the perils of the land that\nhe instanced was that of hanging. For every hundred men that they hung\non land, he said, not more than twenty would be hung at sea. The men\nwere to sleep at their guns. They would not go far that night; for the\nrisk of being wrecked at night was another danger peculiar to the\nland, while at sea you might sail from set of sun till dawn: yet it\nwas essential to get out of sight of the sea for if anyone knew they\nwere there they'd have cavalry after them. And he had sent back\nSmerdrak (a young lieutenant of pirates) to cover their tracks where\nthey came up from the sea. And the merry men vigorously nodded their\nheads though they did not dare to cheer, and presently Smerdrak came\nrunning up and they threw him a rope by the stern. And when they had\ndone fifteen knots they anchored, and Captain Shard gathered his men\nabout him and, standing by the land-wheel in the bows, under the large\nand clear Algerian stars, he explained his system of steering. There\nwas not much to be said for it, he had with considerable ingenuity\ndetached and pivoted the portion of the keel that held the leading\naxle and could move it by chains which were controlled from the\nland-wheel, thus the front pair of wheels could be deflected at will,\nbut only very slightly, and they afterwards found that in a hundred\nyards they could only turn their ship four yards from her course. But\nlet not captains of comfortable battleships, or owners even of yachts,\ncriticise too harshly a man who was not of their time and who knew not\nmodern contrivances; it should be remembered also that Shard was no\nlonger at sea. His steering may have been clumsy but he did what he\ncould.\n\nWhen the use and limitations of his land-wheel had been made clear to\nhis men, Shard bade them all turn in except those on watch. Long\nbefore dawn he woke them and by the very first gleam of light they got\ntheir ship under way, so that when those two fleets that had made so\nsure of Shard closed in like a great crescent on the Algerian coast\nthere was no sign to see of the Desperate Lark either on sea or land;\nand the flags of the Admiral's ship broke out into a hearty English\noath.\n\nThe gale blew for three days and, Shard using more sail by daylight,\nthey scudded over the sands at little less than ten knots, though on\nthe report of rough water ahead (as the lookout man called rocks, low\nhills or uneven surface before he adapted himself to his new\nsurroundings) the rate was much decreased. Those were long summer days\nand Shard who was anxious while the wind held good to outpace the\nrumour of his own appearance sailed for nineteen hours a day, lying to\nat ten in the evening and hoisting sail again at three a.m. when it\nfirst began to be light.\n\nIn those three days he did five hundred miles; then the wind dropped\nto a breeze though it still blew from the North, and for a week they\ndid no more than two knots an hour. The merry men began to murmur\nthen. Luck had distinctly favoured Shard at first for it sent him at\nten knots through the only populous districts well ahead of crowds\nexcept those who chose to run, and the cavalry were away on a local\nraid. As for the runners they soon dropped off when Shard pointed his\ncannon though he did not dare to fire, up there near the coast; for\nmuch as he jeered at the intelligence of the English and Spanish\nAdmirals in not suspecting his manoeuvre, the only one as he said that\nwas possible in the circumstances, yet he knew that cannon had an\nobvious sound which would give his secret away to the weakest mind.\nCertainly luck had befriended him, and when it did so no longer he\nmade out of the occasion all that could be made; for instance while\nthe wind held good he had never missed opportunities to revictual, if\nhe passed by a village its pigs and poultry were his, and whenever he\npassed by water he filled his tanks to the brim, and now that he could\nonly do two knots he sailed all night with a man and a lantern before\nhim: thus in that week he did close on four hundred miles while\nanother man would have anchored at night and have missed five or six\nhours out of the twenty-four. Yet his men murmured. Did he think the\nwind would last for ever, they said. And Shard only smoked. It was\nclear that he was thinking, and thinking hard. \"But what is he\nthinking about?\" said Bill to Bad Jack. And Bad Jack answered: \"He may\nthink as hard as he likes but thinking won't get us out of the Sahara\nif this wind were to drop.\"\n\nAnd towards the end of that week Shard went to his chart-room and laid\na new course for his ship a little to the East and towards\ncultivation. And one day towards evening they sighted a village, and\ntwilight came and the wind dropped altogether. Then the murmurs of the\nmerry men grew to oaths and nearly to mutiny. \"Where were they now?\"\nthey asked, and were they being treated like poor honest men?\n\nShard quieted them by asking what they wished to do themselves and\nwhen no one had any better plan than going to the villagers and saying\nthat they had been blown out of their course by a storm, Shard\nunfolded his scheme to them. Long ago he had heard how they drove\ncarts with oxen in Africa, oxen were very numerous in these parts\nwherever there was any cultivation, and for this reason when the wind\nhad begun to drop he had laid his course for the village: that night\nthe moment it was dark they were to drive off fifty yoke of oxen; by\nmidnight they must all be yoked to the bows and then away they would\ngo at a good round gallop.\n\nSo fine a plan as this astonished the men and they all apologised for\ntheir want of faith in Shard, shaking hands with him every one and\nspitting on their hands before they did so in token of good will.\n\nThe raid that night succeeded admirably, but ingenious as Shard was on\nland, and a past-master at sea, yet it must be admitted that lack of\nexperience in this class of seamanship led him to make a mistake, a\nslight one it is true, and one that a little practice would have\nprevented altogether: the oxen could not gallop. Shard swore at them,\nthreatened them with his pistol, said they should have no food, and\nall to no avail: that night and as long as they pulled the bad ship\nDesperate Lark they did one knot an hour and no more. Shard's failures\nlike everything that came his way were used as stones in the edifice\nof his future success, he went at once to his chart-room and worked\nout all his calculations anew.\n\nThe matter of the oxen's pace made pursuit impossible to avoid. Shard\ntherefore countermanded his order to his lieutenant to cover the\ntracks in the sand, and the Desperate Lark plodded on into the Sahara\non her new course trusting to her guns.\n\nThe village was not a large one and the little crowd that was sighted\nastern next morning disappeared after the first shot from the cannon\nin the stern. At first Shard made the oxen wear rough iron bits,\nanother of his mistakes, and strong bits too. \"For if they run away,\"\nhe had said, \"we might as well be driving before a gale and there's no\nsaying where we'd find ourselves,\" but after a day or two he found\nthat the bits were no good and, like the practical man he was,\nimmediately corrected his mistake.\n\nAnd now the crew sang merry songs all day bringing out mandolins and\nclarionets and cheering Captain Shard. All were jolly except the\ncaptain himself whose face was moody and perplexed; he alone expected\nto hear more of those villagers; and the oxen were drinking up the\nwater every day, he alone feared that there was no more to be had, and\na very unpleasant fear that is when your ship is becalmed in a desert.\nFor over a week they went on like this doing ten knots a day and the\nmusic and singing got on the captain's nerves, but he dared not tell\nhis men what the trouble was. And then one day the oxen drank up the\nlast of the water. And Lieutenant Smerdrak came and reported the fact.\n\n\"Give them rum,\" said Shard, and he cursed the oxen. \"What is good\nenough for me,\" he said, \"should be good enough for them,\" and he\nswore that they should have rum.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the young lieutenant of pirates.\n\nShard should not be judged by the orders he gave that day, for nearly\na fortnight he had watched the doom that was coming slowly towards\nhim, discipline cut him off from anyone that might have shared his\nfear and discussed it, and all the while he had had to navigate his\nship, which even at sea is an arduous responsibility. These things had\nfretted the calm of that clear judgment that had once baffled five\nnavies. Therefore he cursed the oxen and ordered them rum, and\nSmerdrak had said \"Aye, aye, sir,\" and gone below.\n\nTowards sunset Shard was standing on the poop, thinking of death; it\nwould not come to him by thirst; mutiny first, he thought. The oxen\nwere refusing rum for the last time, and the men were beginning to eye\nCaptain Shard in a very ominous way, not muttering, but each man\nlooking at him with a sidelong look of the eye as though there were\nonly one thought among them all that had no need of words. A score of\ngeese like a long letter \"V\" were crossing the evening sky, they\nslanted their necks and all went twisting downwards somewhere about\nthe horizon. Captain Shard rushed to his chart-room, and presently the\nmen came in at the door with Old Frank in front looking awkward and\ntwisting his cap in his hand.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Shard as though nothing were wrong.\n\nThen Old Frank said what he had come to say: \"We want to know what you\nbe going to do.\"\n\nAnd the men nodded grimly.\n\n\"Get water for the oxen,\" said Captain Shard, \"as the swine won't have\nrum, and they'll have to work for it, the lazy beasts. Up anchor!\"\n\nAnd at the word water a look came into their faces like when some\nwanderer suddenly thinks of home.\n\n\"Water!\" they said.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Captain Shard. And none of them ever knew that but for\nthose geese, that slanted their necks and suddenly twisted downwards,\nthey would have found no water that night nor ever after, and the\nSahara would have taken them as she has taken so many and shall take\nso many more. All that night they followed their new course: at dawn\nthey found an oasis and the oxen drank.\n\nAnd here, on this green acre or so with its palm-trees and its well,\nbeleaguered by thousands of miles of desert and holding out through\nthe ages, here they decided to stay: for those who have been without\nwater for a while in one of Africa's deserts come to have for that\nsimple fluid such a regard as you, O reader, might not easily credit.\nAnd here each man chose a site where he would build his hut, and\nsettle down, and marry perhaps, and even forget the sea; when Captain\nShard having filled his tanks and barrels peremptorily ordered them to\nweigh anchor. There was much dissatisfaction, even some grumbling, but\nwhen a man has twice saved his fellows from death by the sheer\nfreshness of his mind they come to have a respect for his judgment\nthat is not shaken by trifles. It must be remembered that in the\naffair of the dropping of the wind and again when they ran out of\nwater these men were at their wits' end: so was Shard on the last\noccasion, but that they did not know. All this Shard knew, and he\nchose this occasion to strengthen the reputation that he had in the\nminds of the men of that bad ship by explaining to them his motives,\nwhich usually he kept secret. The oasis he said must be a port of call\nfor all the travellers within hundreds of miles: how many men did you\nsee gathered together in any part of the world where there was a drop\nof whiskey to be had! And water here was rarer than whiskey in decent\ncountries and, such was the peculiarity of the Arabs, even more\nprecious. Another thing he pointed out to them, the Arabs were a\nsingularly inquisitive people and if they came upon a ship in the\ndesert they would probably talk about it; and the world having a\nwickedly malicious tongue would never construe in its proper light\ntheir difference with the English and Spanish fleets, but would merely\nside with the strong against the weak.\n\nAnd the men sighed, and sang the capstan song and hoisted the anchor\nand yoked the oxen up, and away they went doing their steady knot,\nwhich nothing could increase. It may be thought strange that with all\nsail furled in dead calm and while the oxen rested they should have\ncast anchor at all. But custom is not easily overcome and long\nsurvives its use. Rather enquire how many such useless customs we\nourselves preserve: the flaps for instance to pull up the tops of\nhunting-boots though the tops no longer pull up, the bows on our\nevening shoes that neither tie nor untie. They said they felt safer\nthat way and there was an end of it.\n\nShard lay a course of South by West and they did ten knots that day,\nthe next day they did seven or eight and Shard hove to. Here he\nintended to stop, they had huge supplies of fodder on board for the\noxen, for his men he had a pig or so, plenty of poultry, several sacks\nof biscuits and ninety-eight oxen (for two were already eaten), and\nthey were only twenty miles from water. Here he said they would stay\ntill folks forgot their past, someone would invent something or some\nnew thing would turn up to take folks' minds off them and the ships he\nhad sunk: he forgot that there are men who are well paid to remember.\n\nHalf way between him and the oasis he established a little depot where\nhe buried his water-barrels. As soon as a barrel was empty he sent\nhalf a dozen men to roll it by turns to the depot. This they would do\nat night, keeping hid by day, and next night they would push on to the\noasis, fill the barrel and roll it back. Thus only ten miles away he\nsoon had a store of water, unknown to the thirstiest native of Africa,\nfrom which he could safely replenish his tanks at will. He allowed his\nmen to sing and even within reason to light fires. Those were jolly\nnights while the rum held out; sometimes they saw gazelles watching\nthem curiously, sometimes a lion went by over the sand, the sound of\nhis roar added to their sense of the security of their ship; all round\nthem level, immense lay the Sahara: \"This is better than an English\nprison,\" said Captain Shard.\n\nAnd still the dead calm lasted, not even the sand whispered at night\nto little winds; and when the rum gave out and it looked like trouble,\nShard reminded them what little use it had been to them when it was\nall they had and the oxen wouldn't look at it.\n\nAnd the days wore on with singing, and even dancing at times, and at\nnights round a cautious fire in a hollow of sand with only one man on\nwatch they told tales of the sea. It was all a relief after arduous\nwatches and sleeping by the guns, a rest to strained nerves and eyes;\nand all agreed, for all that they missed their rum, that the best\nplace for a ship like theirs was the land.\n\nThis was in Latitude 23 North, Longitude 4 East, where, as I have\nsaid, a ship's broadside was heard for the first time and the last. It\nhappened this way.\n\nThey had been there several weeks and had eaten perhaps ten or a dozen\noxen and all that while there had been no breath of wind and they had\nseen no one: when one morning about two bells when the crew were at\nbreakfast the lookout man reported cavalry on the port side. Shard who\nhad already surrounded his ship with sharpened stakes ordered all his\nmen on board, the young trumpeter who prided himself on having picked\nup the ways of the land, sounded \"Prepare to receive cavalry\". Shard\nsent a few men below with pikes to the lower port-holes, two more\naloft with muskets, the rest to the guns, he changed the \"grape\" or\n\"canister\" with which the guns were loaded in case of surprise, for\nshot, cleared the decks, drew in ladders, and before the cavalry came\nwithin range everything was ready for them. The oxen were always yoked\nin order that Shard could manoeuvre his ship at a moment's notice.\n\nWhen first sighted the cavalry were trotting but they were coming on\nnow at a slow canter. Arabs in white robes on good horses. Shard\nestimated that there were two or three hundred of them. At sixty yards\nShard opened with one gun, he had had the distance measured, but had\nnever practised for fear of being heard at the oasis: the shot went\nhigh. The next one fell short and ricochetted over the Arabs' heads.\nShard had the range then and by the time the ten remaining guns of his\nbroadside were given the same elevation as that of his second gun the\nArabs had come to the spot where the last shot pitched. The broadside\nhit the horses, mostly low, and ricochetted on amongst them; one\ncannon-ball striking a rock at the horses' feet shattered it and sent\nfragments flying amongst the Arabs with the peculiar scream of things\nset free by projectiles from their motionless harmless state, and the\ncannon-ball went on with them with a great howl, this shot alone\nkilled three men.\n\n\"Very satisfactory,\" said Shard rubbing his chin. \"Load with grape,\"\nhe added sharply.\n\nThe broadside did not stop the Arabs nor even reduce their speed but\nthey crowded in closer together as though for company in their time of\ndanger, which they should not have done. They were four hundred yards\noff now, three hundred and fifty; and then the muskets began, for the\ntwo men in the crow's-nest had thirty loaded muskets besides a few\npistols, the muskets all stood round them leaning against the rail;\nthey picked them up and fired them one by one. Every shot told, but\nstill the Arabs came on. They were galloping now. It took some time to\nload the guns in those days. Three hundred yards, two hundred and\nfifty, men dropping all the way, two hundred yards; Old Frank for all\nhis one ear had terrible eyes; it was pistols now, they had fired all\ntheir muskets; a hundred and fifty; Shard had marked the fifties with\nlittle white stones. Old Frank and Bad Jack up aloft felt pretty\nuneasy when they saw the Arabs had come to that little white stone,\nthey both missed their shots.\n\n\"All ready?\" said Captain Shard.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Smerdrak.\n\n\"Right,\" said Captain Shard raising a finger.\n\nA hundred and fifty yards is a bad range at which to be caught by\ngrape (or \"case\" as we call it now), the gunners can hardly miss and\nthe charge has time to spread. Shard estimated afterwards that he got\nthirty Arabs by that broadside alone and as many horses.\n\nThere were close on two hundred of them still on their horses, yet the\nbroadside of grape had unsettled them, they surged round the ship but\nseemed doubtful what to do. They carried swords and scimitars in their\nhands, though most had strange long muskets slung behind them, a few\nunslung them and began firing wildly. They could not reach Shard's\nmerry men with their swords. Had it not been for that broadside that\ntook them when it did they might have climbed up from their horses and\ncarried the bad ship by sheer force of numbers, but they would have\nhad to have been very steady, and the broadside spoiled all that.\nTheir best course was to have concentrated all their efforts in\nsetting fire to the ship but this they did not attempt. Part of them\nswarmed all round the ship brandishing their swords and looking vainly\nfor an easy entrance; perhaps they expected a door, they were not\nsea-faring people; but their leaders were evidently set on driving off\nthe oxen not dreaming that the Desperate Lark had other means of\ntravelling. And this to some extent they succeeded in doing. Thirty\nthey drove off, cutting the traces, twenty they killed on the spot\nwith their scimitars though the bow gun caught them twice as they did\ntheir work, and ten more were unluckily killed by Shard's bow gun.\nBefore they could fire a third time from the bows they all galloped\naway, firing back at the oxen with their muskets and killing three\nmore, and what troubled Shard more than the loss of his oxen was the\nway that they manoeuvred, galloping off just when the bow gun was\nready and riding off by the port bow where the broadside could not get\nthem, which seemed to him to show more knowledge of guns than they\ncould have learned on that bright morning. What, thought Shard to\nhimself, if they should bring big guns against the Desperate Lark! And\nthe mere thought of it made him rail at Fate. But the merry men all\ncheered when they rode away. Shard had only twenty-two oxen left, and\nthen a score or so of the Arabs dismounted while the rest rode further\non leading their horses. And the dismounted men lay down on the port\nbow behind some rocks two hundred yards away and began to shoot at the\noxen. Shard had just enough of them left to manoeuvre his ship with an\neffort and he turned his ship a few points to the starboard so as to\nget a broadside at the rocks. But grape was of no use here as the only\nway he could get an Arab was by hitting one of the rocks with shot\nbehind which an Arab was lying, and the rocks were not easy to hit\nexcept by chance, and as often as he manoeuvred his ship the Arabs\nchanged their ground. This went on all day while the mounted Arabs\nhovered out of range watching what Shard would do; and all the while\nthe oxen were growing fewer, so good a mark were they, until only ten\nwere left, and the ship could manoeuvre no longer. But then they all\nrode off.\n\nThe merry men were delighted, they calculated that one way and another\nthey had unhorsed a hundred Arabs and on board there had been no more\nthan one man wounded: Bad Jack had been hit in the wrist; probably by\na bullet meant for the men at the guns, for the Arabs were firing\nhigh. They had captured a horse and had found quaint weapons on the\nbodies of the dead Arabs and an interesting kind of tobacco. It was\nevening now and they talked over the fight, made jokes about their\nluckier shots, smoked their new tobacco and sang; altogether it was\nthe jolliest evening they'd had. But Shard alone on the quarter-deck\npaced to and fro pondering, brooding and wondering. He had chopped off\nBad Jack's wounded hand and given him a hook out of store, for captain\ndoes doctor upon these occasions and Shard, who was ready for most\nthings, kept half a dozen or so of neat new limbs, and of course a\nchopper. Bad Jack had gone below swearing a little and said he'd lie\ndown for a bit, the men were smoking and singing on the sand, and\nShard was there alone. The thought that troubled Shard was: what would\nthe Arabs do? They did not look like men to go away for nothing. And\nat back of all his thoughts was one that reiterated guns, guns, guns.\nHe argued with himself that they could not drag them all that way on\nthe sand, that the Desperate Lark was not worth it, that they had\ngiven it up. Yet he knew in his heart that that was what they would\ndo. He knew there were fortified towns in Africa, and as for its being\nworth it, he knew that there was no pleasant thing left now to those\ndefeated men except revenge, and if the Desperate Lark had come over\nthe sand why not guns? He knew that the ship could never hold out\nagainst guns and cavalry, a week perhaps, two weeks, even three: what\ndifference did it make how long it was, and the men sang:\n\n    Away we go, Oho, Oho, Oho,\n    A drop of rum for you and me\n    And the world's as round as the letter O\n    And round it runs the sea.\n\nA melancholy settled down on Shard.\n\nAbout sunset Lieutenant Smerdrak came up for orders. Shard ordered a\ntrench to be dug along the port side of the ship. The men wanted to\nsing and grumbled at having to dig, especially as Shard never\nmentioned his fear of guns, but he fingered his pistols and in the end\nShard had his way. No one on board could shoot like Captain Shard.\nThat is often the way with captains of pirate ships, it is a difficult\nposition to hold. Discipline is essential to those that have the right\nto fly the skull-and-cross-bones, and Shard was the man to enforce it.\nIt was starlight by the time the trench was dug to the captain's\nsatisfaction and the men that it was to protect when the worst came to\nthe worst swore all the time as they dug. And when it was finished\nthey clamoured to make a feast on some of the killed oxen, and this\nShard let them do. And they lit a huge fire for the first time,\nburning abundant scrub, they thinking that Arabs daren't return, Shard\nknowing that concealment was now useless. All that night they feasted\nand sang, and Shard sat up in his chart-room making his plans.\n\nWhen morning came they rigged up the cutter as they called the\ncaptured horse and told off her crew. As there were only two men that\ncould ride at all these became the crew of the cutter. Spanish Dick\nand Bill the Boatswain were the two.\n\nShard's orders were that turn and turn about they should take command\nof the cutter and cruise about five miles off to the North East all\nthe day but at night they were to come in. And they fitted the horse\nup with a flagstaff in front of the saddle so that they could signal\nfrom her, and carried an anchor behind for fear she should run away.\n\nAnd as soon as Spanish Dick had ridden off Shard sent some men to roll\nall the barrels back from the depot where they were buried in the\nsand, with orders to watch the cutter all the time and, if she\nsignalled, to return as fast as they could.\n\nThey buried the Arabs that day, removing their water-bottles and any\nprovisions they had, and that night they got all the water-barrels in,\nand for days nothing happened. One event of extraordinary importance\ndid indeed occur, the wind got up one day, but it was due South, and\nas the oasis lay to the North of them and beyond that they might pick\nup the camel track Shard decided to stay where he was. If it had\nlooked to him like lasting Shard might have hoisted sail but it it\ndropped at evening as he knew it would, and in any case it was not the\nwind he wanted. And more days went by, two weeks without a breeze. The\ndead oxen would not keep and they had had to kill three more, there\nwere only seven left now.\n\nNever before had the men been so long without rum. And Captain Shard\nhad doubled the watch besides making two more men sleep at the guns.\nThey had tired of their simple games, and most of their songs, and\ntheir tales that were never true were no longer new. And then one day\nthe monotony of the desert came down upon them.\n\nThere is a fascination in the Sahara, a day there is delightful, a\nweek is pleasant, a fortnight is a matter of opinion, but it was\nrunning into months. The men were perfectly polite but the boatswain\nwanted to know when Shard thought of moving on. It was an unreasonable\nquestion to ask of the captain of any ship in a dead calm in a desert,\nbut Shard said he would set a course and let him know in a day or two.\nAnd a day or two went by over the monotony of the Sahara, who for\nmonotony is unequalled by all the parts of the earth. Great marshes\ncannot equal it, nor plains of grass nor the sea, the Sahara alone\nlies unaltered by the seasons, she has no altering surface, no flowers\nto fade or grow, year in year out she is changeless for hundreds and\nhundreds of miles. And the boatswain came again and took off his cap\nand asked Captain Shard to be so kind as to tell them about his new\ncourse. Shard said he meant to stay until they had eaten three more of\nthe oxen as they could only take three of them in the hold, there were\nonly six left now. But what if there was no wind, the boatswain said.\nAnd at that moment the faintest breeze from the North ruffled the\nboatswain's forelock as he stood with his cap in his hand.\n\n\"Don't talk about the wind to _me_,\" said Captain Shard: and Bill was\na little frightened for Shard's mother had been a gipsy.\n\nBut it was only a breeze astray, a trick of the Sahara. And another\nweek went by and they ate two more oxen.\n\nThey obeyed Captain Shard ostentatiously now but they wore ominous\nlooks. Bill came again and Shard answered him in Romany.\n\nThings were like this one hot Sahara morning when the cutter\nsignalled. The lookout man told Shard and Shard read the message,\n\"Cavalry astern\" it read, and then a little later she signalled, \"With\nguns.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Captain Shard.\n\nOne ray of hope Shard had; the flags on the cutter fluttered. For the\nfirst time for five weeks a light breeze blew from the North, very\nlight, you hardly felt it. Spanish Dick rode in and anchored his horse\nto starboard and the cavalry came on slowly from the port.\n\nNot till the afternoon did they come in sight, and all the while that\nlittle breeze was blowing.\n\n\"One knot,\" said Shard at noon. \"Two knots,\" he said at six bells and\nstill it grew and the Arabs trotted nearer. By five o'clock the merry\nmen of the bad ship Desperate Lark could make out twelve long\nold-fashioned guns on low wheeled carts dragged by horses and what\nlooked like lighter guns carried on camels. The wind was blowing a\nlittle stronger now. \"Shall we hoist sail, sir?\" said Bill.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Shard.\n\nBy six o'clock the Arabs were just outside the range of cannon and\nthere they halted. Then followed an anxious hour or so, but the Arabs\ncame no nearer. They evidently meant to wait till dark to bring their\nguns up. Probably they intended to dig a gun epaulment from which they\ncould safely pound away at the ship.\n\n\"We could do three knots,\" said Shard half to himself as he was\nwalking up and down his quarter-deck with very fast short paces. And\nthen the sun set and they heard the Arabs praying and Shard's merry\nmen cursed at the top of their voices to show that they were as good\nmen as they.\n\nThe Arabs had come no nearer, waiting for night. They did not know how\nShard was longing for it too, he was gritting his teeth and sighing\nfor it, he even would have prayed, but that he feared that it might\nremind Heaven of him and his merry men.\n\nNight came and the stars. \"Hoist sail,\" said Shard. The men sprang to\ntheir places, they had had enough of that silent lonely spot. They\ntook the oxen on board and let the great sails down, and like a lover\ncoming from over sea, long dreamed of, long expected, like a lost\nfriend seen again after many years, the North wind came into the\npirates' sails. And before Shard could stop it a ringing English cheer\nwent away to the wondering Arabs.\n\nThey started off at three knots and soon they might have done four but\nShard would not risk it at night. All night the wind held good, and\ndoing three knots from ten to four they were far out of sight of the\nArabs when daylight came. And then Shard hoisted more sail and they\ndid four knots and by eight bells they were doing four and a half. The\nspirits of those volatile men rose high, and discipline became\nperfect. So long as there was wind in the sails and water in the tanks\nCaptain Shard felt safe at least from mutiny. Great men can only be\noverthrown while their fortunes are at their lowest. Having failed to\ndepose Shard when his plans were open to criticism and he himself\nscarce knew what to do next it was hardly likely they could do it now;\nand whatever we think of his past and his way of living we cannot deny\nthat Shard was among the great men of the world.\n\nOf defeat by the Arabs he did not feel so sure. It was useless to try\nto cover his tracks even if he had had time, the Arab cavalry could\nhave picked them up anywhere. And he was afraid of their camels with\nthose light guns on board, he had heard they could do seven knots and\nkeep it up most of the day and if as much as one shot struck the\nmainmast... and Shard taking his mind off useless fears worked out on\nhis chart when the Arabs were likely to overtake them. He told his men\nthat the wind would hold good for a week, and, gipsy or no, he\ncertainly knew as much about the wind as is good for a sailor to know.\n\nAlone in his chart-room he worked it out like this, mark two hours to\nthe good for surprise and finding the tracks and delay in starting,\nsay three hours if the guns were mounted in their epaulments, then the\nArabs should start at seven. Supposing the camels go twelve hours a\nday at seven knots they would do eighty-four knots a day, while Shard\ndoing three knots from ten to four, and four knots the rest of the\ntime, was doing ninety and actually gaining. But when it came to it he\nwouldn't risk more than two knots at night while the enemy were out of\nsight, for he rightly regarded anything more than that as dangerous\nwhen sailing on land at night, so he too did eighty-four knots a day.\nIt was a pretty race. I have not troubled to see if Shard added up his\nfigures wrongly or if he under-rated the pace of camels, but whatever\nit was the Arabs gained slightly, for on the fourth day Spanish Jack,\nfive knots astern on what they called the cutter, sighted the camels a\nvery long way off and signalled the fact to Shard. They had left their\ncavalry behind as Shard supposed they would. The wind held good, they\nhad still two oxen left and could always eat their \"cutter\", and they\nhad a fair, though not ample, supply of water, but the appearance of\nthe Arabs was a blow to Shard for it showed him that there was no\ngetting away from them, and of all things he dreaded guns. He made\nlight of it to the men: said they would sink the lot before they had\nbeen in action half an hour: yet he feared that once the guns came up\nit was only a question of time before his rigging was cut or his\nsteering gear disabled.\n\nOne point the Desperate Lark scored over the Arabs and a very good one\ntoo, darkness fell just before they could have sighted her and now\nShard used the lantern ahead as he dared not do on the first night\nwhen the Arabs were close, and with the help of it managed to do three\nknots. The Arabs encamped in the evening and the Desperate Lark gained\ntwenty knots. But the next evening they appeared again and this time\nthey saw the sails of the Desperate Lark.\n\nOn the sixth day they were close. On the seventh they were closer. And\nthen, a line of verdure across their bows, Shard saw the Niger River.\n\nWhether he knew that for a thousand miles it rolled its course through\nforest, whether he even knew that it was there at all; what his plans\nwere, or whether he lived from day to day like a man whose days are\nnumbered he never told his men. Nor can I get an indication on this\npoint from the talk that I hear from sailors in their cups in a\ncertain tavern I know of. His face was expressionless, his mouth shut,\nand he held his ship to her course. That evening they were up to the\nedge of the tree trunks and the Arabs camped and waited ten knots\nastern and the wind had sunk a little.\n\nThere Shard anchored a little before sunset and landed at once. At\nfirst he explored the forest a little on foot. Then he sent for\nSpanish Dick. They had slung the cutter on board some days ago when\nthey found she could not keep up. Shard could not ride but he sent for\nSpanish Dick and told him he must take him as a passenger. So Spanish\nDick slung him in front of the saddle \"before the mast\" as Shard\ncalled it, for they still carried a mast on the front of the saddle,\nand away they galloped together. \"Rough weather,\" said Shard, but he\nsurveyed the forest as he went and the long and short of it was he\nfound a place where the forest was less than half a mile thick and the\nDesperate Lark might get through: but twenty trees must be cut. Shard\nmarked the trees himself, sent Spanish Dick right back to watch the\nArabs and turned the whole of his crew on to those twenty trees. It\nwas a frightful risk, the Desperate Lark was empty, with an enemy no\nmore than ten knots astern, but it was a moment for bold measures and\nShard took the chance of being left without his ship in the heart of\nAfrica in the hope of being repaid by escaping altogether.\n\nThe men worked all night on those twenty trees, those that had no axes\nbored with bradawls and blasted, and then relieved those that had.\n\nShard was indefatigable, he went from tree to tree showing exactly\nwhat way every one was to fall, and what was to be done with them when\nthey were down. Some had to be cut down because their branches would\nget in the way of the masts, others because their trunks would be in\nthe way of the wheels; in the case of the last the stumps had to be\nmade smooth and low with saws and perhaps a bit of the trunk sawn off\nand rolled away. This was the hardest work they had. And they were all\nlarge trees, on the other hand had they been small there would have\nbeen many more of them and they could not have sailed in and out,\nsometimes for hundreds of yards, without cutting any at all: and all\nthis Shard calculated on doing if only there was time.\n\nThe light before dawn came and it looked as if they would never do it\nat all. And then dawn came and it was all done but one tree, the hard\npart of the work had all been done in the night and a sort of final\nrush cleared everything up except that one huge tree. And then the\ncutter signalled the Arabs were moving. At dawn they had prayed, and\nnow they had struck their camp. Shard at once ordered all his men to\nthe ship except ten whom he left at the tree, they had some way to go\nand the Arabs had been moving some ten minutes before they got there.\nShard took in the cutter which wasted five minutes, hoisted sail\nshort-handed and that took five minutes more, and slowly got under\nway.\n\nThe wind was dropping still and by the time the Desperate Lark had\ncome to the edge of that part of the forest through which Shard had\nlaid his course the Arabs were no more than five knots away. He had\nsailed East half a mile, which he ought to have done overnight so as\nto be ready, but he could not spare time or thought or men away from\nthose twenty trees. Then Shard turned into the forest and the Arabs\nwere dead astern. They hurried when they saw the Desperate Lark enter\nthe forest.\n\n\"Doing ten knots,\" said Shard as he watched them from the deck. The\nDesperate Lark was doing no more than a knot and a half for the wind\nwas weak under the lee of the trees. Yet all went well for a while.\nThe big tree had just come down some way ahead, and the ten men were\nsawing bits off the trunk.\n\nAnd then Shard saw a branch that he had not marked on the chart, it\nwould just catch the top of the mainmast. He anchored at once and sent\na hand aloft who sawed it half way through and did the rest with a\npistol, and now the Arabs were only three knots astern. For a quarter\nof a mile Shard steered them through the forest till they came to the\nten men and that bad big tree, another foot had yet to come off one\ncorner of the stump for the wheels had to pass over it. Shard turned\nall hands on to the stump and it was then that the Arabs came within\nshot. But they had to unpack their gun. And before they had it mounted\nShard was away. If they had charged things might have been different.\nWhen they saw the Desperate Lark under way again the Arabs came on to\nwithin three hundred yards and there they mounted two guns. Shard\nwatched them along his stern gun but would not fire. They were six\nhundred yards away before the Arabs could fire and then they fired too\nsoon and both guns missed. And Shard and his merry men saw clear water\nonly ten fathoms ahead. Then Shard loaded his stern gun with canister\ninstead of shot and at the same moment the Arabs charged on their\ncamels; they came galloping down through the forest waving long\nlances. Shard left the steering to Smerdrak and stood by the stern\ngun, the Arabs were within fifty yards and still Shard did not fire;\nhe had most of his men in the stern with muskets beside him. Those\nlances carried on camels were altogether different from swords in the\nhands of horsemen, they could reach the men on deck. The men could see\nthe horrible barbs on the lanceheads, they were almost at their faces\nwhen Shard fired, and at the same moment the Desperate Lark with her\ndry and suncracked keel in air on the high bank of the Niger fell\nforward like a diver. The gun went off through the tree-tops, a wave\ncame over the bows and swept the stern, the Desperate Lark wriggled\nand righted herself, she was back in her element.\n\nThe merry men looked at the wet decks and at their dripping\nclothes. \"Water,\" they said almost wonderingly.\n\nThe Arabs followed a little way through the forest but when they saw\nthat they had to face a broadside instead of one stern gun and\nperceived that a ship afloat is less vulnerable to cavalry even than\nwhen on shore, they abandoned ideas of revenge, and comforted\nthemselves with a text out of their sacred book which tells how in\nother days and other places our enemies shall suffer even as we\ndesire.\n\nFor a thousand miles with the flow of the Niger and the help of\noccasional winds, the Desperate Lark moved seawards. At first he\nsweeps East a little and then Southwards, till you come to Akassa and\nthe open sea.\n\nI will not tell you how they caught fish and ducks, raided a village\nhere and there and at last came to Akassa, for I have said much\nalready of Captain Shard. Imagine them drawing nearer and nearer the\nsea, bad men all, and yet with a feeling for something where we feel\nfor our king, our country or our home, a feeling for something that\nburned in them not less ardently than our feelings in us, and that\nsomething the sea. Imagine them nearing it till sea birds appeared and\nthey fancied they felt sea breezes and all sang songs again that they\nhad not sung for weeks. Imagine them heaving at last on the salt\nAtlantic again.\n\nI have said much already of Captain Shard and I fear lest I shall\nweary you, O my reader, if I tell you any more of so bad a man. I too\nat the top of a tower all alone am weary.\n\nAnd yet it is right that such a tale should be told. A journey almost\ndue South from near Algiers to Akassa in a ship that we should call no\nmore than a yacht. Let it be a stimulus to younger men.\n\n\n                       Guarantee To The Reader\n\nSince writing down for your benefit, O my reader, all this long tale\nthat I heard in the tavern by the sea I have travelled in Algeria and\nTunisia as well as in the Desert. Much that I saw in those countries\nseems to throw doubt on the tale that the sailor told me. To begin\nwith the Desert does not come within hundreds of miles of the coast\nand there are more mountains to cross than you would suppose, the\nAtlas mountains in particular. It is just possible Shard might have\ngot through by El Cantara, following the camel road which is many\ncenturies old; or he may have gone by Algiers and Bou Saada and\nthrough the mountain pass El Finita Dem, though that is a bad enough\nway for camels to go (let alone bullocks with a ship) for which reason\nthe Arabs call it Finita Dem--the Path of Blood.\n\nI should not have ventured to give this story the publicity of print\nhad the sailor been sober when he told it, for fear that he I should\nhave deceived you, O my reader; but this was never the case with him\nas I took good care to ensure: \"in vino veritas\" is a sound old\nproverb, and I never had cause to doubt his word unless that proverb\nlies.\n\nIf it should prove that he has deceived me, let it pass; but if he has\nbeen the means of deceiving you there are little things about him that\nI know, the common gossip of that ancient tavern whose leaded\nbottle-glass windows watch the sea, which I will tell at once to every\njudge of my acquaintance, and it will be a pretty race to see which of\nthem will hang him.\n\nMeanwhile, O my reader, believe the story, resting assured that if you\nare taken in the thing shall be a matter for the hangman.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Tale of the Equator\n\nHe who is Sultan so remote to the East that his dominions were deemed\nfabulous in Babylon, whose name is a by-word for distance today in the\nstreets of Bagdad, whose capital bearded travellers invoke by name in\nthe gate at evening to gather hearers to their tales when the smoke of\ntobacco arises, dice rattle and taverns shine; even he in that very\ncity made mandate, and said: \"Let there be brought hither all my\nlearned men that they may come before me and rejoice my heart with\nlearning.\"\n\nMen ran and clarions sounded, and it was so that there came before the\nSultan all of his learned men. And many were found wanting. But of\nthose that were able to say acceptable things, ever after to be named\nThe Fortunate, one said that to the South of the Earth lay a Land--\nsaid Land was crowned with lotus--where it was summer in our winter\ndays and where it was winter in summer.\n\nAnd when the Sultan of those most distant lands knew that the Creator\nof All had contrived a device so vastly to his delight his merriment\nknew no bounds. On a sudden he spake and said, and this was the gist\nof his saying, that upon that line of boundary or limit that divided\nthe North from the South a palace be made, where in the Northern\ncourts should summer be, while in the South was winter; so should he\nmove from court to court according to his mood, and dally with the\nsummer in the morning and spend the noon with snow. So the Sultan's\npoets were sent for and bade to tell of that city, foreseeing its\nsplendour far away to the South and in the future of time; and some\nwere found fortunate. And of those that were found fortunate and were\ncrowned with flowers none earned more easily the Sultan's smile (on\nwhich long days depended) than he that foreseeing the city spake of it\nthus:\n\n\"In seven years and seven days, O Prop of Heaven, shall thy builders\nbuild it, thy palace that is neither North nor South, where neither\nsummer nor winter is sole lord of the hours. White I see it, very\nvast, as a city, very fair, as a woman, Earth's wonder, with many\nwindows, with thy princesses peering out at twilight; yea, I behold\nthe bliss of the gold balconies, and hear a rustling down long\ngalleries and the doves' coo upon its sculptured eaves. O Prop of\nHeaven, would that so fair a city were built by thine ancient sires,\nthe children of the sun, that so might all men see it even today, and\nnot the poets only, whose vision sees it so far away to the South and\nin the future of time.\n\n\"O King of the Years, it shall stand midmost on that line that\ndivideth equally the North from the South and that parteth the seasons\nasunder as with a screen. On the Northern side when summer is in the\nNorth thy silken guards shall pace by dazzling walls while thy\nspearsmen clad in furs go round the South. But at the hour of noon in\nthe midmost day of the year thy chamberlain shall go down from his\nhigh place and into the midmost court, and men with trumpets shall go\ndown behind him, and he shall utter a great cry at noon, and the men\nwith trumpets shall cause their trumpets to blare, and the spearsmen\nclad in furs shall march to the North and thy silken guard shall take\ntheir place in the South, and summer shall leave the North and go to\nthe South, and all the swallows shall rise and follow after. And alone\nin thine inner courts shall no change be, for they shall lie narrowly\nalong that line that parteth the seasons in sunder and divideth the\nNorth from the South, and thy long gardens shall lie under them.\n\n\"And in thy gardens shall spring always be, for spring lies ever at\nthe marge of summer; and autumn also shall always tint thy gardens,\nfor autumn always flares at winter's edge, and those gardens shall lie\napart between winter and summer. And there shall be orchards in thy\ngarden, too, with all the burden of autumn on their boughs and all the\nblossom of spring.\n\n\"Yea, I behold this palace, for we see future things; I see its white\nwall shine in the huge glare of midsummer, and the lizards lying along\nit motionless in the sun, and men asleep in the noonday, and the\nbutterflies floating by, and birds of radiant plumage chasing\nmarvellous moths; far off the forest and great orchids glorying there,\nand iridescent insects dancing round in the light. I see the wall upon\nthe other side; the snow has come upon the battlements, the icicles\nhave fringed them like frozen beards, a wild wind blowing out of\nlonely places and crying to the cold fields as it blows has sent the\nsnowdrifts higher than the buttresses; they that look out through\nwindows on that side of thy palace see the wild geese flying low and\nall the birds of the winter, going by swift in packs beat low by the\nbitter wind, and the clouds above them are black, for it is midwinter\nthere; while in thine other courts the fountains tinkle, falling on\nmarble warmed by the fire of the summer sun.\n\n\"Such, O King of the Years, shall thy palace be, and its name shall be\nErlathdronion, Earth's Wonder; and thy wisdom shall bid thine\narchitects build at once, that all may see what as yet the poets see\nonly, and that prophecy be fulfilled.\"\n\nAnd when the poet ceased the Sultan spake, and said, as all men\nhearkened with bent heads:\n\n\"It will be unnecessary for my builders to build this palace,\nErlathdronion, Earth's Wonder, for in hearing thee we have drunk\nalready its pleasures.\"\n\nAnd the poet went forth from the Presence and dreamed a new thing.\n\n                      .     .     .     .     .\n\n\n\n\n\nA Narrow Escape\n\nIt was underground.\n\nIn that dank cavern down below Belgrave Square the walls were\ndripping. But what was that to the magician? It was secrecy that he\nneeded, not dryness. There he pondered upon the trend of events,\nshaped destinies and concocted magical brews.\n\nFor the last few years the serenity of his ponderings had been\ndisturbed by the noise of the motor-bus; while to his keen ears there\ncame the earthquake-rumble, far off, of the train in the tube, going\ndown Sloane Street; and when he heard of the world above his head was\nnot to its credit.\n\nHe decided one evening over his evil pipe, down there in his dank\nchamber, that London had lived long enough, had abused its\nopportunities, had gone too far, in fine, with its civilisation. And\nso he decided to wreck it.\n\nTherefore he beckoned up his acolyte from the weedy end of the cavern,\nand, \"Bring me,\" he said, \"the heart of the toad that dwelleth in\nArabia and by the mountains of Bethany.\" The acolyte slipped away by\nthe hidden door, leaving that grim old man with his frightful pipe,\nand whither he went who knows but the gipsy people, or by what path he\nreturned; but within a year he stood in the cavern again, slipping\nsecretly in by the trap while the old man smoked, and he brought with\nhim a little fleshy thing that rotted in a casket of pure gold.\n\n\"What is it?\" the old man croaked.\n\n\"It is,\" said the acolyte, \"the heart of the toad that dwelt once\nin Arabia and by the mountains of Bethany.\"\n\nThe old man's crooked fingers closed on it, and he blessed the acolyte\nwith his rasping voice and claw-like hand uplifted; the motor-bus\nrumbled above on its endless journey; far off the train shook Sloane\nStreet.\n\n\"Come,\" said the old magician, \"it is time.\" And there and then they\nleft the weedy cavern, the acolyte carrying cauldron, gold poker and\nall things needful, and went abroad in the light. And very wonderful\nthe old man looked in his silks.\n\nTheir goal was the outskirts of London; the old man strode in front\nand the acolyte ran behind him, and there was something magical in the\nold man's stride alone, without his wonderful dress, the cauldron and\nwand, the hurrying acolyte and the small gold poker.\n\nLittle boys jeered till they caught the old man's eye. So there went\non through London this strange procession of two, too swift for any to\nfollow. Things seemed worse up there than they did in the cavern, and\nthe further they got on their way towards London's outskirts the worse\nLondon got. \"It is time,\" said the old man, \"surely.\"\n\nAnd so they came at last to London's edge and a small hill watching it\nwith a mournful look. It was so mean that the acolyte longed for the\ncavern, dank though it was and full of terrible sayings that the old\nman said when he slept.\n\nThey climbed the hill and put the cauldron down, and put there in the\nnecessary things, and lit a fire of herbs that no chemist will sell\nnor decent gardener grow, and stirred the cauldron with the golden\npoker. The magician retired a little apart and muttered, then he\nstrode back to the cauldron and, all being ready, suddenly opened the\ncasket and let the fleshy thing fall in to boil.\n\nThen he made spells, then he flung up his arms; the fumes from the\ncauldron entering in at his mind he said raging things that he had not\nknown before and runes that were dreadful (the acolyte screamed);\nthere he cursed London from fog to loam-pit, from zenith to the abyss,\nmotor-bus, factory, shop, parliament, people. \"Let them all perish,\"\nhe said, \"and London pass away, tram lines and bricks and pavement,\nthe usurpers too long of the fields, let them all pass away and the\nwild hares come back, blackberry and briar-rose.\"\n\n\"Let it pass,\" he said, \"pass now, pass utterly.\"\n\nIn the momentary silence the old man coughed, then waited with eager\neyes; and the long long hum of London hummed as it always has since\nfirst the reed-huts were set up by the river, changing its note at\ntimes but always humming, louder now than it was in years gone by, but\nhumming night and day though its voice be cracked with age; so it\nhummed on.\n\nAnd the old man turned him round to his trembling acolyte and terribly\nsaid as he sank into the earth: \"YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT ME THE HEART\nOF THE TOAD THAT DWELLETH IN ARABIA NOR BY THE MOUNTAINS OF BETHANY!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Watch-tower\n\nI sat one April in Provence on a small hill above an ancient town\nthat Goth and Vandal as yet have forborne to \"bring up to date.\"\n\nOn the hill was an old worn castle with a watch-tower, and a well with\nnarrow steps and water in it still.\n\nThe watch-tower, staring South with neglected windows, faced a broad\nvalley full of the pleasant twilight and the hum of evening things: it\nsaw the fires of wanderers blink from the hills, beyond them the long\nforest black with pines, one star appearing, and darkness settling\nslowly down on Var.\n\nSitting there listening to the green frogs croaking, hearing far\nvoices clearly but all transmuted by evening, watching the windows in\nthe little town glimmering one by one, and seeing the gloaming dwindle\nsolemnly into night, a great many things fell from mind that seem\nimportant by day, and evening in their place planted strange fancies.\n\nLittle winds had arisen and were whispering to and fro, it grew cold,\nand I was about to descend the hill, when I heard a voice behind me\nsaying, \"Beware, beware.\"\n\nSo much the voice appeared a part of the evening that I did not turn\nround at first; it was like voices that one hears in sleep and thinks\nto be of one's dream. And the word was monotonously repeated, in\nFrench.\n\nWhen I turned round I saw an old man with a horn. He had a white beard\nmarvellously long, and still went on saying slowly, \"Beware, beware.\"\nHe had clearly just come from the tower by which he stood, though I\nhad heard no footfall. Had a man come stealthily upon me at such an\nhour and in so lonesome a place I had certainly felt surprised; but I\nsaw almost at once that he was a spirit, and he seemed with his\nuncouth horn and his long white beard and that noiseless step of his\nto be so native to that time and place that I spoke to him as one does\nto some fellow-traveller who asks you if you mind having the window\nup.\n\nI asked him what there was to beware of.\n\n\"Of what should a town beware,\" he said, \"but the Saracens?\"\n\n\"Saracens?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, Saracens, Saracens,\" he answered and brandished his horn.\n\n\"And who are you?\" I said.\n\n\"I, I am the spirit of the tower,\" he said.\n\nWhen I asked him how he came by so human an aspect and was so unlike\nthe material tower beside him he told me that the lives of all the\nwatchers who had ever held the horn in the tower there had gone to\nmake the spirit of the tower. \"It takes a hundred lives,\" he said.\n\"None hold the horn of late and men neglect the tower. When the walls\nare in ill repair the Saracens come: it was ever so.\"\n\n\"The Saracens don't come nowadays,\" I said.\n\nBut he was gazing past me watching, and did not seem to heed me.\n\n\"They will run down those hills,\" he said, pointing away to the South,\n\"out of the woods about nightfall, and I shall blow my horn. The\npeople will all come up from the town to the tower again; but the\nloopholes are in very ill repair.\"\n\n\"We never hear of the Saracens now,\" I said.\n\n\"Hear of the Saracens!\" the old spirit said. \"Hear of the Saracens!\nThey slip one evening out of that forest, in the long white robes that\nthey wear, and I blow my horn. That is the first that anyone ever\nhears of the Saracens.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" I said, \"that they never come at all. They cannot come and\nmen fear other things.\" For I thought the old spirit might rest if he\nknew that the Saracens can never come again. But he said, \"There is\nnothing in the world to fear but the Saracens. Nothing else matters.\nHow can men fear other things?\"\n\nThen I explained, so that he might have rest, and told him how all\nEurope, and in particular France, had terrible engines of war, both on\nland and sea; and how the Saracens had not these terrible engines\neither on sea or land, and so could by no means cross the\nMediterranean or escape destruction on shore even though they should\ncome there. I alluded to the European railways that could move armies\nnight and day faster than horses could gallop. And when as well as I\ncould I had explained all, he answered, \"In time all these things pass\naway and then there will still be the Saracens.\"\n\nAnd then I said, \"There has not been a Saracen either in France\nor Spain for over four hundred years.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"The Saracens! You do not know their cunning. That was\never the way of the Saracens. They do not come for a while, no not\nthey, for a long while, and then one day they come.\"\n\nAnd peering southwards, but not seeing clearly because of the rising\nmist, he silently moved to his tower and up its broken steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Plash-Goo Came to the Land of None's Desire\n\nIn a thatched cottage of enormous size, so vast that we might consider\nit a palace, but only a cottage in the style of its building, its\ntimbers and the nature of its interior, there lived Plash-Goo.\n\nPlash-Goo was of the children of the giants, whose sire was Uph. And\nthe lineage of Uph had dwindled in bulk for the last five hundred\nyears, till the giants were now no more than fifteen foot high; but\nUph ate elephants which he caught with his hands.\n\nNow on the tops of the mountains above the house of Plash-Goo, for\nPlash-Goo lived in the plains, there dwelt the dwarf whose name was\nLrippity-Kang. And the dwarf used to walk at evening on the edge of\nthe tops of the mountains, and would walk up and down along it, and\nwas squat and ugly and hairy, and was plainly seen of Plash-Goo.\n\nAnd for many weeks the giant had suffered the sight of him, but at\nlength grew irked at the sight (as men are by little things), and\ncould not sleep of a night and lost his taste for pigs. And at last\nthere came the day, as anyone might have known, when Plash-Goo\nshouldered his club and went up to look for the dwarf.\n\nAnd the dwarf though briefly squat was broader than may be dreamed,\nbeyond all breadth of man, and stronger than men may know; strength in\nits very essence dwelt in that little frame, as a spark in the heart\nof a flint: but to Plash-Goo he was no more than mis-shapen, bearded\nand squat, a thing that dared to defy all natural laws by being more\nbroad than long.\n\nWhen Plash-Goo came to the mountain he cast his chimahalk down (for so\nhe named the club of his heart's desire) lest the dwarf should defy\nhim with nimbleness; and stepped towards Lrippity-Kang with gripping\nhands, who stopped in his mountainous walk without a word, and swung\nround his hideous breadth to confront Plash-Goo. Already then\nPlash-Goo in the deeps of his mind had seen himself seize the dwarf in\none large hand and hurl him with his beard and his hated breadth sheer\ndown the precipice that dropped away from that very place to the land\nof None's Desire. Yet it was otherwise that Fate would have it. For\nthe dwarf parried with his little arms the grip of those monstrous\nhands, and gradually working along the enormous limbs came at length\nto the giant's body where by dwarfish cunning he obtained a grip; and\nturning Plash-Goo about, as a spider does some great fly, till his\nlittle grip was suitable to his purpose, he suddenly lifted the giant\nover his head. Slowly at first, by the edge of that precipice whose\nbase sheer distance hid, he swung his giant victim round his head, but\nsoon faster and faster; and at last when Plash-Goo was streaming round\nthe hated breadth of the dwarf and the no less hated beard was\nflapping in the wind, Lrippity-Kang let go. Plash-Goo shot over the\nedge and for some way further, out towards Space, like a stone; then\nhe began to fall. It was long before he believed and truly knew that\nthis was really he that fell from this mountain, for we do not\nassociate such dooms with ourselves; but when he had fallen for some\nwhile through the evening and saw below him, where there had been\nnothing to see, or began to see, the glimmer of tiny fields, then his\noptimism departed; till later on when the fields were greener and\nlarger he saw that this was indeed (and growing now terribly nearer)\nthat very land to which he had destined the dwarf.\n\nAt last he saw it unmistakable, close, with its grim houses and its\ndreadful ways, and its green fields shining in the light of the\nevening. His cloak was streaming from him in whistling shreds.\n\nSo Plash-Goo came to the Land of None's Desire.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Three Sailors' Gambit\n\nSitting some years ago in the ancient tavern at Over, one afternoon in\nSpring, I was waiting, as was my custom, for something strange to\nhappen. In this I was not always disappointed for the very curious\nleaded panes of that tavern, facing the sea, let a light into the\nlow-ceilinged room so mysterious, particularly at evening, that it\nsomehow seemed to affect the events within. Be that as it may, I have\nseen strange things in that tavern and heard stranger things told.\n\nAnd as I sat there three sailors entered the tavern, just back, as\nthey said, from sea, and come with sunburned skins from a very long\nvoyage to the South; and one of them had a board and chessmen under\nhis arm, and they were complaining that they could find no one who\nknew how to play chess. This was the year that the Tournament was in\nEngland. And a little dark man at a table in a corner of the room,\ndrinking sugar and water, asked them why they wished to play chess;\nand they said they would play any man for a pound. They opened their\nbox of chessmen then, a cheap and nasty set, and the man refused to\nplay with such uncouth pieces, and the sailors suggested that perhaps\nhe could find better ones; and in the end he went round to his\nlodgings near by and brought his own, and then they sat down to play\nfor a pound a side. It was a consultation game on the part of the\nsailors, they said that all three must play.\n\nWell, the little dark man turned out to be Stavlokratz.\n\nOf course he was fabulously poor, and the sovereign meant more to him\nthan it did to the sailors, but he didn't seem keen to play, it was\nthe sailors that insisted; he had made the badness of the sailors'\nchessmen an excuse for not playing at all, but the sailors had\noverruled that, and then he told them straight out who he was, and the\nsailors had never heard of Stavlokratz.\n\nWell, no more was said after that. Stavlokratz said no more, either\nbecause he did not wish to boast or because he was huffed that they\ndid not know who he was. And I saw no reason to enlighten the sailors\nabout him; if he took their pound they had brought it upon themselves,\nand my boundless admiration for his genius made me feel that he\ndeserved whatever might come his way. He had not asked to play, they\nhad named the stakes, he had warned them, and gave them the first\nmove; there was nothing unfair about Stavlokratz.\n\nI had never seen Stavlokratz before, but I had played over nearly\nevery one of his games in the World Championship for the last three or\nfour years; he was always of course the model chosen by students. Only\nyoung chess-players can appreciate my delight at seeing him play first\nhand.\n\nWell, the sailors used to lower their heads almost as low as the table\nand mutter together before every move, but they muttered so low that\nyou could not hear what they planned.\n\nThey lost three pawns almost straight off, then a knight, and shortly\nafter a bishop; they were playing in fact the famous Three Sailors'\nGambit.\n\nStavlokratz was playing with the easy confidence that they say was\nusual with him, when suddenly at about the thirteenth move I saw him\nlook surprised; he leaned forward and looked at the board and then at\nthe sailors, but he learned nothing from their vacant faces; he looked\nback at the board again.\n\nHe moved more deliberately after that; the sailors lost two more\npawns, Stavlokratz had lost nothing as yet. He looked at me I thought\nalmost irritably, as though something would happen that he wished I\nwas not there to see. I believed at first that he had qualms about\ntaking the sailors' pound, until it dawned on me that he might lose\nthe game; I saw that possibility in his face, not on the board, for\nthe game had become almost incomprehensible to me. I cannot describe\nmy astonishment. And a few moves later Stavlokratz resigned.\n\nThe sailors showed no more elation than if they had won some game with\ngreasy cards, playing amongst themselves.\n\nStavlokratz asked them where they got their opening. \"We kind of\nthought of it,\" said one. \"It just come into our heads like,\" said\nanother. He asked them questions about the ports they had touched at.\nHe evidently thought as I did myself that they had learned their\nextraordinary gambit, perhaps in some old dependancy of Spain, from\nsome young master of chess whose fame had not reached Europe. He was\nvery eager to find out who this man could be, for neither of us\nimagined that those sailors had invented it, nor would anyone who had\nseen them. But he got no information from the sailors.\n\nStavlokratz could very ill afford the loss of a pound. He offered to\nplay them again for the same stakes. The sailors began to set up the\nwhite pieces. Stavlokratz pointed out that it was his turn for the\nfirst move. The sailors agreed but continued to set up the white\npieces and sat with the white before them waiting for him to move. It\nwas a trivial incident, but it revealed to Stavlokratz and myself that\nnone of these sailors was aware that white always moves first.\n\nStavlokratz played them on his own opening, reasoning of course that\nas they had never heard of Stavlokratz they would not know of his\nopening; and with probably a very good hope of getting back his pound\nhe played the fifth variation with its tricky seventh move, at least\nso he intended, but it turned to a variation unknown to the students\nof Stavlokratz.\n\nThroughout this game I watched the sailors closely, and I became sure,\nas only an attentive watcher can be, that the one on their left, Jim\nBunion, did not even know the moves.\n\nWhen I had made up my mind about this I watched only the other two,\nAdam Bailey and Bill Sloggs, trying to make out which was the master\nmind; and for a long while I could not. And then I heard Adam Bailey\nmutter six words, the only words I heard throughout the game, of all\ntheir consultations, \"No, him with the horse's head.\" And I decided\nthat Adam Bailey did not know what a knight was, though of course he\nmight have been explaining things to Bill Sloggs, but it did not sound\nlike that; so that left Bill Sloggs. I watched Bill Sloggs after that\nwith a certain wonder; he was no more intellectual than the others to\nlook at, though rather more forceful perhaps. Poor old Stavlokratz was\nbeaten again.\n\nWell, in the end I paid for Stavlokratz, and tried to get a game with\nBill Sloggs alone, but this he would not agree to, it must be all\nthree or none: and then I went back with Stavlokratz to his lodgings.\nHe very kindly gave me a game: of course it did not last long but I am\nprouder of having been beaten by Stavlokratz than of any game that I\nhave ever won. And then we talked for an hour about the sailors, and\nneither of us could make head or tail of them. I told him what I had\nnoticed about Jim Bunion and Adam Bailey, and he agreed with me that\nBill Sloggs was the man, though as to how he had come by that gambit\nor that variation of Stavlokratz's own opening he had no theory.\n\nI had the sailors' address which was that tavern as much as anywhere,\nand they were to be there all evening. As evening drew in I went back\nto the tavern, and found there still the three sailors. And I offered\nBill Sloggs two pounds for a game with him alone and he refused, but\nin the end he played me for a drink. And then I found that he had not\nheard of the \"en passant\" rule, and believed that the fact of checking\nthe king prevented him from castling, and did not know that a player\ncan have two or more queens on the board at the same time if he queens\nhis pawns, or that a pawn could ever become a knight; and he made as\nmany of the stock mistakes as he had time for in a short game, which I\nwon. I thought that I should have got at the secret then, but his\nmates who had sat scowling all the while in the corner came up and\ninterfered. It was a breach of their compact apparently for one to\nplay by himself, at any rate they seemed angry. So I left the tavern\nthen and came back again next day, and the next day and the day after,\nand often saw the sailors, but none were in a communicative mood. I\nhad got Stavlokratz to keep away, and they could get no one to play\nchess with at a pound a side, and I would not play with them unless\nthey told me the secret.\n\nAnd then one evening I found Jim Bunion drunk, yet not so drunk as he\nwished, for the two pounds were spent; and I gave him very nearly a\ntumbler of whiskey, or what passed for whiskey in that tavern at Over,\nand he told me the secret at once. I had given the others some whiskey\nto keep them quiet, and later on in the evening they must have gone\nout, but Jim Bunion stayed with me by a little table leaning across it\nand talking low, right into my face, his breath smelling all the while\nof what passed for whiskey.\n\nThe wind was blowing outside as it does on bad nights in November,\ncoming up with moans from the South, towards which the tavern faced\nwith all its leaded panes, so that none but I was able to hear his\nvoice as Jim Bunion gave up his secret. They had sailed for years, he\ntold me, with Bill Snyth; and on their last voyage home Bill Snyth had\ndied. And he was buried at sea. Just the other side of the line they\nburied him, and his pals divided his kit, and these three got his\ncrystal that only they knew he had, which Bill got one night in Cuba.\nThey played chess with the crystal.\n\nAnd he was going on to tell me about that night in Cuba when Bill had\nbought the crystal from the stranger, how some folks might think they\nhad seen thunderstorms, but let them go and listen to that one that\nthundered in Cuba when Bill was buying his crystal and they'd find\nthat they didn't know what thunder was. But then I interrupted him,\nunfortunately perhaps, for it broke the thread of his tale and set him\nrambling a while, and cursing other people and talking of other lands,\nChina, Port Said and Spain: but I brought him back to Cuba again in\nthe end. I asked him how they could play chess with a crystal; and he\nsaid that you looked at the board and looked at the crystal, and there\nwas the game in the crystal the same as it was on the board, with all\nthe odd little pieces looking just the same though smaller, horses'\nheads and whatnots; and as soon as the other man moved the move came\nout in the crystal, and then your move appeared after it, and all you\nhad to do was to make it on the board. If you didn't make the move\nthat you saw in the crystal things got very bad in it, everything\nhorribly mixed and moving about rapidly, and scowling and making the\nsame move over and over again, and the crystal getting cloudier and\ncloudier; it was best to take one's eyes away from it then, or one\ndreamt about it afterwards, and the foul little pieces came and cursed\nyou in your sleep and moved about all night with their crooked moves.\n\nI thought then that, drunk though he was, he was not telling the\ntruth, and I promised to show him to people who played chess all their\nlives so that he and his mates could get a pound whenever they liked,\nand I promised not to reveal his secret even to Stavlokratz, if only\nhe would tell me all the truth; and this promise I have kept till long\nafter the three sailors have lost their secret. I told him straight\nout that I did not believe in the crystal. Well, Jim Bunion leaned\nforward then, even further across the table, and swore he had seen the\nman from whom Bill had bought the crystal and that he was one to whom\nanything was possible. To begin with his hair was villainously dark,\nand his features were unmistakable even down there in the South, and\nhe could play chess with his eyes shut, and even then he could beat\nanyone in Cuba. But there was more than this, there was the bargain he\nmade with Bill that told one who he was. He sold that crystal for Bill\nSnyth's soul.\n\nJim Bunion leaning over the table with his breath in my face nodded\nhis head several times and was silent.\n\nI began to question him then. Did they play chess as far away as Cuba?\nHe said they all did. Was it conceivable that any man would make such\na bargain as Snyth made? Wasn't the trick well known? Wasn't it in\nhundreds of books? And if he couldn't read books mustn't he have heard\nfrom sailors that it is the Devil's commonest dodge to get souls from\nsilly people?\n\nJim Bunion had leant back in his own chair quietly smiling at my\nquestions but when I mentioned silly people he leaned forward again,\nand thrust his face close to mine and asked me several times if I\ncalled Bill Snyth silly. It seemed that these three sailors thought a\ngreat deal of Bill Snyth and it made Jim Bunion angry to hear anything\nsaid against him. I hastened to say that the bargain seemed silly\nthough not of course the man who made it; for the sailor was almost\nthreatening, and no wonder for the whiskey in that dim tavern would\nmadden a nun.\n\nWhen I said that the bargain seemed silly he smiled again, and then he\nthundered his fist down on the table and said that no one had ever yet\ngot the best of Bill Snyth and that that was the worst bargain for\nhimself that the Devil ever made, and that from all he had read or\nheard of the Devil he had never been so badly had before as the night\nwhen he met Bill Snyth at the inn in the thunderstorm in Cuba, for\nBill Snyth already had the damndest soul at sea; Bill was a good\nfellow, but his soul was damned right enough, so he got the crystal\nfor nothing.\n\nYes, he was there and saw it all himself, Bill Snyth in the Spanish\ninn and the candles flaring, and the Devil walking in and out of the\nrain, and then the bargain between those two old hands, and the Devil\ngoing out into the lightning, and the thunderstorm raging on, and Bill\nSnyth sitting chuckling to himself between the bursts of the thunder.\n\nBut I had more questions to ask and interrupted this reminiscence. Why\ndid they all three always play together? And a look of something like\nfear came over Jim Bunion's face; and at first he would not speak. And\nthen he said to me that it was like this; they had not paid for that\ncrystal, but got it as their share of Bill Snyth's kit. If they had\npaid for it or given something in exchange to Bill Snyth that would\nhave been all right, but they couldn't do that now because Bill was\ndead, and they were not sure if the old bargain might not hold good.\nAnd Hell must be a large and lonely place, and to go there alone must\nbe bad, and so the three agreed that they would all stick together,\nand use the crystal all three or not at all, unless one died, and then\nthe two would use it and the one that was gone would wait for them.\nAnd the last of the three to go would take the crystal with him, or\nmaybe the crystal would bring him. They didn't think, they said, they\nwere the kind of men for Heaven, and he hoped they knew their place\nbetter than that, but they didn't fancy the notion of Hell alone, if\nHell it had to be. It was all right for Bill Snyth, he was afraid of\nnothing. He had known perhaps five men that were not afraid of death,\nbut Bill Snyth was not afraid of Hell. He died with a smile on his\nface like a child in its sleep; it was drink killed poor Bill Snyth.\n\nThis was why I had beaten Bill Sloggs; Sloggs had the crystal on him\nwhile we played, but would not use it; these sailors seemed to fear\nloneliness as some people fear being hurt; he was the only one of the\nthree who could play chess at all, he had learnt it in order to be\nable to answer questions and keep up their pretence, but he had learnt\nit badly, as I found. I never saw the crystal, they never showed it to\nanyone; but Jim Bunion told me that night that it was about the size\nthat the thick end of a hen's egg would be if it were round. And then\nhe fell asleep.\n\nThere were many more questions that I would have asked him but I could\nnot wake him up. I even pulled the table away so that he fell to the\nfloor, but he slept on, and all the tavern was dark but for one candle\nburning; and it was then that I noticed for the first time that the\nother two sailors had gone, no one remained at all but Jim Bunion and\nI and the sinister barman of that curious inn, and he too was asleep.\n\nWhen I saw that it was impossible to wake the sailor I went out into\nthe night. Next day Jim Bunion would talk of it no more; and when I\nwent back to Stavlokratz I found him already putting on paper his\ntheory about the sailors, which became accepted by chess-players, that\none of them had been taught their curious gambit and that the other\ntwo between them had learnt all the defensive openings as well as\ngeneral play. Though who taught them no one could say, in spite of\nenquiries made afterwards all along the Southern Pacific.\n\nI never learnt any more details from any of the three sailors, they\nwere always too drunk to speak or else not drunk enough to be\ncommunicative. I seem just to have taken Jim Bunion at the flood. But\nI kept my promise, it was I that introduced them to the Tournament,\nand a pretty mess they made of established reputations. And so they\nkept on for months, never losing a game and always playing for their\npound a side. I used to follow them wherever they went merely to watch\ntheir play. They were more marvellous than Stavlokratz even in his\nyouth.\n\nBut then they took to liberties such as giving their queen when\nplaying first-class players. And in the end one day when all three\nwere drunk they played the best player in England with only a row of\npawns. They won the game all right. But the ball broke to pieces. I\nnever smelt such a stench in all my life.\n\nThe three sailors took it stoically enough, they signed on to\ndifferent ships and went back again to the sea, and the world of chess\nlost sight, for ever I trust, of the most remarkable players it ever\nknew, who would have altogether spoiled the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Exiles Club\n\nIt was an evening party; and something someone had said to me had\nstarted me talking about a subject that to me is full of fascination,\nthe subject of old religions, forsaken gods. The truth (for all\nreligions have some of it), the wisdom, the beauty, of the religions\nof countries to which I travel have not the same appeal for me; for\none only notices in them their tyranny and intolerance and the abject\nservitude that they claim from thought; but when a dynasty has been\ndethroned in heaven and goes forgotten and outcast even among men,\none's eyes no longer dazzled by its power find something very wistful\nin the faces of fallen gods suppliant to be remembered, something\nalmost tearfully beautiful, like a long warm summer twilight fading\ngently away after some day memorable in the story of earthly wars.\nBetween what Zeus, for instance, has been once and the half-remembered\ntale he is today there lies a space so great that there is no change\nof fortune known to man whereby we may measure the height down which\nhe has fallen. And it is the same with many another god at whom once\nthe ages trembled and the twentieth century treats as an old wives'\ntale. The fortitude that such a fall demands is surely more than\nhuman.\n\nSome such things as these I was saying, and being upon a subject that\nmuch attracts me I possibly spoke too loudly, certainly I was not\naware that standing close behind me was no less a person than the\nex-King of Eritivaria, the thirty islands of the East, or I would have\nmoderated my voice and moved away a little to give him more room. I\nwas not aware of his presence until his satellite, one who had fallen\nwith him into exile but still revolved about him, told me that his\nmaster desired to know me; and so to my surprise I was presented\nthough neither of them even knew my name. And that was how I came to\nbe invited by the ex-King to dine at his club.\n\nAt the time I could only account for his wishing to know me by\nsupposing that he found in his own exiled condition some likeness to\nthe fallen fortunes of the gods of whom I talked unwitting of his\npresence; but now I know that it was not of himself he was thinking\nwhen he asked me to dine at that club.\n\nThe club would have been the most imposing building in any street in\nLondon, but in that obscure mean quarter of London in which they had\nbuilt it it appeared unduly enormous. Lifting right up above those\ngrotesque houses and built in that Greek style that we call Georgian,\nthere was something Olympian about it. To my host an unfashionable\nstreet could have meant nothing, through all his youth wherever he had\ngone had become fashionable the moment he went there; words like the\nEast End could have had no meaning to him.\n\nWhoever built that house had enormous wealth and cared nothing for\nfashion, perhaps despised it. As I stood gazing at the magnificent\nupper windows draped with great curtains, indistinct in the evening,\non which huge shadows flickered my host attracted my attention from\nthe doorway, and so I went in and met for the second time the ex-King\nof Eritivaria.\n\nIn front of us a stairway of rare marble led upwards, he took me\nthrough a side-door and downstairs and we came to a banqueting-hall of\ngreat magnificence. A long table ran up the middle of it, laid for\nquite twenty people, and I noticed the peculiarity that instead of\nchairs there were thrones for everyone except me, who was the only\nguest and for whom there was an ordinary chair. My host explained to\nme when we all sat down that everyone who belonged to that club was by\nrights a king.\n\nIn fact none was permitted, he told me, to belong to the club until\nhis claim to a kingdom made out in writing had been examined and\nallowed by those whose duty it was. The whim of a populace or the\ncandidate's own misrule were never considered by the investigators,\nnothing counted with them but heredity and lawful descent from kings,\nall else was ignored. At that table there were those who had once\nreigned themselves, others lawfully claimed descent from kings that\nthe world had forgotten, the kingdoms claimed by some had even changed\ntheir names. Hatzgurh, the mountain kingdom, is almost regarded as\nmythical.\n\nI have seldom seen greater splendour than that long hall provided\nbelow the level of the street. No doubt by day it was a little sombre,\nas all basements are, but at night with its great crystal chandeliers,\nand the glitter of heirlooms that had gone into exile, it surpassed\nthe splendour of palaces that have only one king. They had come to\nLondon suddenly most of those kings, or their fathers before them, or\nforefathers; some had come away from their kingdoms by night, in a\nlight sleigh, flogging the horses, or had galloped clear with morning\nover the border, some had trudged roads for days from their capital in\ndisguise, yet many had had time just as they left to snatch up some\nsmall thing without price in markets, for the sake of old times as\nthey said, but quite as much, I thought, with an eye to the future.\nAnd there these treasures glittered on that long table in the\nbanqueting-hall of the basement of that strange club. Merely to see\nthem was much, but to hear their story that their owners told was to\ngo back in fancy to epic times on the romantic border of fable and\nfact, where the heroes of history fought with the gods of myth. The\nfamous silver horses of Gilgianza were there climbing their sheer\nmountain, which they did by miraculous means before the time of the\nGoths. It was not a large piece of silver but its workmanship\noutrivalled the skill of the bees.\n\nA yellow Emperor had brought out of the East a piece of that\nincomparable porcelain that had made his dynasty famous though all\ntheir deeds are forgotten, it had the exact shade of the right purple.\n\nAnd there was a little golden statuette of a dragon stealing a diamond\nfrom a lady, the dragon had the diamond in his claws, large and of the\nfirst water. There had been a kingdom whose whole constitution and\nhistory were founded on the legend, from which alone its kings had\nclaimed their right to the scepter, that a dragon stole a diamond from\na lady. When its last king left that country, because his favorite\ngeneral used a peculiar formation under the fire of artillery, he\nbrought with him the little ancient image that no longer proved him a\nking outside that singular club.\n\nThere was the pair of amethyst cups of the turbaned King of Foo, the\none that he drank from himself, and the one that he gave to his\nenemies, eye could not tell which was which.\n\nAll these things the ex-King of Eritivaria showed me, telling me a\nmarvelous tale of each; of his own he had brought nothing, except the\nmascot that used once to sit on the top of the water tube of his\nfavorite motor.\n\nI have not outlined a tenth of the splendour of that table, I had\nmeant to come again and examine each piece of plate and make notes of\nits history; had I known that this was the last time I should wish to\nenter that club I should have looked at its treasures more\nattentively, but now as the wine went round and the exiles began to\ntalk I took my eyes from the table and listened to strange tales of\ntheir former state.\n\nHe that has seen better times has usually a poor tale to tell, some\nmean and trivial thing has been his undoing, but they that dined in\nthat basement had mostly fallen like oaks on nights of abnormal\ntempest, had fallen mightily and shaken a nation. Those who had not\nbeen kings themselves, but claimed through an exiled ancestor, had\nstories to tell of even grander disaster, history seeming to have\nmellowed their dynasty's fate as moss grows over an oak a great while\nfallen. There were no jealousies there as so often there are among\nkings, rivalry must have ceased with the loss of their navies and\narmies, and they showed no bitterness against those that had turned\nthem out, one speaking of the error of his Prime Minister by which he\nhad lost his throne as \"poor old Friedrich's Heaven-sent gift of\ntactlessness.\"\n\nThey gossiped pleasantly of many things, the tittle-tattle we all had\nto know when we were learning history, and many a wonderful story I\nmight have heard, many a side light on mysterious wars had I not made\nuse of one unfortunate word. That word was \"upstairs.\"\n\nThe ex-King of Eritivaria having pointed out to me those unparalleled\nheirlooms to which I have alluded, and many more besides, hospitably\nasked me if there was anything else that I would care to see, he meant\nthe pieces of plate that they had in the cupboards, the curiously\ngraven swords of other princes, historic jewels, legendary seals, but\nI who had had a glimpse of their marvelous staircase, whose balustrade\nI believed to be solid gold and wondering why in such a stately house\nthey chose to dine in the basement, mentioned the word \"upstairs.\" A\nprofound hush came down on the whole assembly, the hush that might\ngreet levity in a cathedral.\n\n\"Upstairs!\" he gasped. \"We cannot go upstairs.\"\n\nI perceived that what I had said was an ill-chosen thing. I tried to\nexcuse myself but knew not how.\n\n\"Of course,\" I muttered, \"members may not take guests upstairs.\"\n\n\"Members!\" he said to me. \"We are not the members!\"\n\nThere was such reproof in his voice that I said no more, I looked at\nhim questioningly, perhaps my lips moved, I may have said \"What are\nyou?\" A great surprise had come on me at their attitude.\n\n\"We are the waiters,\" he said.\n\nThat I could not have known, here at last was honest ignorance that I\nhad no need to be ashamed of, the very opulence of their table denied\nit.\n\n\"Then who are the members?\" I asked.\n\nSuch a hush fell at that question, such a hush of genuine awe, that\nall of a sudden a wild thought entered my head, a thought strange and\nfantastic and terrible. I gripped my host by the wrist and hushed my\nvoice.\n\n\"Are they too exiles?\" I asked.\n\nTwice as he looked in my face he gravely nodded his head.\n\nI left that club very swiftly indeed, never to see it again, scarcely\npausing to say farewell to those menial kings, and as I left the door\na great window opened far up at the top of the house and a flash of\nlightning streamed from it and killed a dog.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Three Infernal Jokes\n\nThis is the story that the desolate man told to me on the lonely\nHighland road one autumn evening with winter coming on and the stags\nroaring.\n\nThe saddening twilight, the mountain already black, the dreadful\nmelancholy of the stags' voices, his friendless mournful face, all\nseemed to be of some most sorrowful play staged in that valley by an\noutcast god, a lonely play of which the hills were part and he the\nonly actor.\n\nFor long we watched each other drawing out of the solitudes of those\nforsaken spaces. Then when we met he spoke.\n\n\"I will tell you a thing that will make you die of laughter. I will\nkeep it to myself no longer. But first I must tell you how I came by\nit.\"\n\nI do not give the story in his words with all his woeful interjections\nand the misery of his frantic self-reproaches for I would not convey\nunnecessarily to my readers that atmosphere of sadness that was about\nall he said and that seemed to go with him where-ever he moved.\n\nIt seems that he had been a member of a club, a West-end club he\ncalled it, a respectable but quite inferior affair, probably in the\nCity: agents belonged to it, fire insurance mostly, but life insurance\nand motor-agents too, it was in fact a touts' club. It seems that a\nfew of them one evening, forgetting for a moment their encyclopedias\nand non-stop tyres, were talking loudly over a card-table when the\ngame had ended about their personal virtues, and a very little man\nwith waxed moustaches who disliked the taste of wine was boasting\nheartily of his temperance. It was then that he who told this mournful\nstory, drawn on by the boasts of others, leaned forward a little over\nthe green baize into the light of the two guttering candles and\nrevealed, no doubt a little shyly, his own extraordinary virtue. One\nwoman was to him as ugly as another.\n\nAnd the silenced boasters rose and went home to bed leaving him all\nalone, as he supposed, with his unequalled virtue. And yet he was not\nalone, for when the rest had gone there arose a member out of a deep\narm-chair at the dark end of the room and walked across to him, a man\nwhose occupation he did not know and only now suspects.\n\n\"You have,\" said the stranger, \"a surpassing virtue.\"\n\n\"I have no possible use for it,\" my poor friend replied.\n\n\"Then doubtless you would sell it cheap,\" said the stranger.\n\nSomething in the man's manner or appearance made the desolate teller\nof this mournful tale feel his own inferiority, which probably made\nhim feel acutely shy, so that his mind abased itself as an Oriental\ndoes his body in the presence of a superior, or perhaps he was sleepy,\nor merely a little drunk. Whatever it was he only mumbled, \"O yes,\"\ninstead of contradicting so mad a remark. And the stranger led the way\nto the room where the telephone was.\n\n\"I think you will find my firm will give a good price for it,\" he\nsaid: and without more ado he began with a pair of pincers to cut the\nwire of the telephone and the receiver. The old waiter who looked\nafter the club they had left shuffling round the other room putting\nthings away for the night.\n\n\"Whatever are you doing of?\" said my friend.\n\n\"This way,\" said the stranger. Along a passage they went and away to\nthe back of the club and there the stranger leaned out of a window and\nfastened the severed wires to the lightning conductor. My friend has\nno doubt of that, a broad ribbon of copper, half an inch wide, perhaps\nwider, running down from the roof to the earth.\n\n\"Hell,\" said the stranger with his mouth to the telephone; then\nsilence for a while with his ear to the receiver, leaning out of the\nwindow. And then my friend heard his poor virtue being several times\nrepeated, and then words like Yes and No.\n\n\"They offer you three jokes,\" said the stranger, \"which shall make all\nwho hear them simply die of laughter.\"\n\nI think my friend was reluctant then to have anything more to do with\nit, he wanted to go home; he said he didn't want jokes.\n\n\"They think very highly of your virtue,\" I said the stranger. And at\nthat, odd as it seems, my friend wavered, for logically if they\nthought highly of the goods they should have paid a higher price.\n\n\"O all right,\" he said. The extraordinary document that the agent drew\nfrom his pocket ran something like this:\n\n\"I . . . . . in consideration of three new jokes received from Mr.\nMontagu-Montague, hereinafter to be called the agent, and warranted to\nbe as by him stated and described, do assign to him, yield, abrogate\nand give up all recognitions, emoluments, perquisites or rewards due\nto me Here or Elsewhere on account of the following virtue, to wit and\nthat is to say . . . . . that all women are to me equally ugly.\" The\nlast eight words being filled in in ink by Mr. Montagu-Montague.\n\nMy poor friend duly signed it. \"These are the jokes,\" said the agent.\nThey were boldly written on three slips of paper. \"They don't seem\nvery funny,\" said the other when he had read them. \"You are immune,\"\nsaid Mr. Montagu-Montague, \"but anyone else who hears them will simply\ndie of laughter: that we guarantee.\"\n\nAn American firm had bought at the price of waste paper a hundred\nthousand copies of The Dictionary of Electricity written when\nelectricity was new,--and it had turned out that even at the time its\nauthor had not rightly grasped his subject,--the firm had paid\n\u00a310,000 to a respectable English paper (no other in fact than\nthe Briton) for the use of its name, and to obtain orders for The\nBriton Dictionary of Electricity was the occupation of my unfortunate\nfriend. He seems to have had a way with him. Apparently he knew by a\nglance at a man, or a look round at his garden, whether to recommend\nthe book as \"an absolutely up-to-date achievement, the finest thing of\nits kind in the world of modern science\" or as \"at once quaint and\nimperfect, a thing to buy and to keep as a tribute to those dear old\ntimes that are gone.\" So he went on with this quaint though usual\nbusiness, putting aside the memory of that night as an occasion on\nwhich he had \"somewhat exceeded\" as they say in circles where a spade\nis called neither a spade nor an agricultural implement but is never\nmentioned at all, being altogether too vulgar. And then one night he\nput on his suit of dress clothes and found the three jokes in the\npocket. That was perhaps a shock. He seems to have thought it over\ncarefully then, and the end of it was he gave a dinner at the club to\ntwenty of the members. The dinner would do no harm he thought--might\neven help the business, and if the joke came off he would be a witty\nfellow, and two jokes still up his sleeve.\n\nWhom he invited or how the dinner went I do not know for he began to\nspeak rapidly and came straight to the point, as a stick that nears a\ncataract suddenly goes faster and faster. The dinner was duly served,\nthe port went round, the twenty men were smoking, two waiters\nloitered, when he after carefully reading the best of the jokes told\nit down the table. They laughed. One man accidentally inhaled his\ncigar smoke and spluttered, the two waiters overheard and tittered\nbehind their hands, one man, a bit of a raconteur himself, quite\nclearly wished not to laugh, but his veins swelled dangerously in\ntrying to keep it back, and in the end he laughed too. The joke had\nsucceeded; my friend smiled at the thought; he wished to say little\ndeprecating things to the man on his right; but the laughter did not\nstop and the waiters would not be silent. He waited, and waited\nwondering; the laughter went roaring on, distinctly louder now, and\nthe waiters as loud as any. It had gone on for three or four minutes\nwhen this frightful thought leaped up all at once in his mind: _it was\nforced laughter!_ However could anything have induced him to tell so\nfoolish a joke? He saw its absurdity as in revelation; and the more he\nthought of it as these people laughed at him, even the waiters too,\nthe more he felt that he could never lift up his head with his brother\ntouts again. And still the laughter went roaring and choking on. He\nwas very angry. There was not much use in having a friend, he thought,\nif one silly joke could not be overlooked; he had fed them too. And\nthen he felt that he had no friends at all, and his anger faded away,\nand a great unhappiness came down on him, and he got quietly up and\nslunk from the room and slipped away from the club. Poor man, he\nscarcely had the heart next morning even to glance at the papers, but\nyou did not need to glance at them, big type was bandied about that\nday as though it were common type, the words of the headlines stared\nat you; and the headlines said:--Twenty-Two Dead Men at a Club.\n\nYes, he saw it then: the laughter had not stopped, some had probably\nburst blood vessels, some must have choked, some succumbed to nausea,\nheart-failure must have mercifully taken some, and they were his\nfriends after all, and none had escaped, not I even the waiters. It\nwas that infernal joke.\n\nHe thought out swiftly, and remembers clear as a nightmare, the drive\nto Victoria Station, the boat-train to Dover and going disguised to\nthe boat: and on the boat pleasantly smiling, almost obsequious, two\nconstables that wished to speak for a moment with Mr. Watkyn-Jones.\nThat was his name.\n\nIn a third-class carriage with handcuffs on his wrists, with forced\nconversation when any, he returned between his captors to Victoria to\nbe tried for murder at the High Court of Bow.\n\nAt the trial he was defended by a young barrister of considerable\nability who had gone into the Cabinet in order to enhance his forensic\nreputation. And he was ably defended. It is no exaggeration to say\nthat the speech for the defence showed it to be usual, even natural\nand right, to give a dinner to twenty men and to slip away without\never saying a word, leaving all, with the waiters, dead. That was the\nimpression left in the minds of the jury. And Mr. Watkyn-Jones felt\nhimself practically free, with all the advantages of his awful\nexperience, and his two jokes intact. But lawyers are still\nexperimenting with the new act which allows a prisoner to give\nevidence. They do not like to make no use of it for fear they may be\nthought not to know of the act, and a lawyer who is not in touch with\nthe very latest laws is soon regarded as not being up to date and he\nmay drop as much as \u00a350,000 a year in fees. And therefore though\nit always hangs their clients they hardly like to neglect it.\n\nMr. Watkyn-Jones was put in the witness box. There he told the simple\ntruth, and a very poor affair it seemed after the impassioned and\nbeautiful things that were uttered by the counsel for the defence. Men\nand women had wept when they heard that. They did not weep when they\nheard Watkyn-Jones. Some tittered. It no longer seemed a right and\nnatural thing to leave one's guests all dead and to fly the country.\nWhere was Justice, they asked, if anyone could do that? And when his\nstory was told the judge rather happily asked if he could make him die\nof laughter too. And what was the joke? For in so grave a place as a\nCourt of Justice no fatal effects need be feared. And hesitatingly the\nprisoner pulled from his pocket the three slips of paper: and\nperceived for the first time that the one on which the first and best\njoke had been written had become quite blank. Yet he could remember\nit, and only too clearly. And he told it from memory to the Court.\n\n\"An Irishman once on being asked by his master to buy a morning paper\nsaid in his usual witty way, 'Arrah and begorrah and I will be after\nwishing you the top of the morning.'\"\n\nNo joke sounds quite so good the second time it is told, it seems to\nlose something of its essence, but Watkyn-Jones was not prepared for\nthe awful stillness with which this one was received; nobody smiled;\nand it had killed twenty-two men. The joke was bad, devilish bad;\ncounsel for the defence was frowning, and an usher was looking in a\nlittle bag for something the judge wanted. And at this moment, as\nthough from far away, without his wishing it, there entered the\nprisoner's head, and shone there and would not go, this old bad\nproverb: \"As well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.\" The jury seemed\nto be just about to retire. \"I have another joke,\" said Watkyn-Jones,\nand then and there he read from the second slip of paper. He watched\nthe paper curiously to see if it would go blank, occupying his mind\nwith so slight a thing as men in dire distress very often do, and the\nwords were almost immediately expunged, swept swiftly as if by a hand,\nand he saw the paper before him as blank as the first. And they were\nlaughing this time, judge, jury, counsel for the prosecution, audience\nand all, and the grim men that watched him upon either side. There was\nno mistake about this joke.\n\nHe did not stay to see the end, and walked out with his eyes fixed on\nthe ground, unable to bear a glance to the right or left. And since\nthen he has wandered, avoiding ports and roaming lonely places. Two\nyears have known him on the Highland roads, often hungry, always\nfriendless, always changing his district, wandering lonely on with his\ndeadly joke.\n\nSometimes for a moment he will enter inns, driven by cold and hunger,\nand hear men in the evening telling jokes and even challenging him;\nbut he sits desolate and silent, lest his only weapon should escape\nfrom him and his last joke spread mourning in a hundred cots. His\nbeard has grown and turned grey and is mixed with moss and weeds, so\nthat no one, I think, not even the police, would recognise him now for\nthat dapper tout that sold The Briton Dictionary of Electricity in\nsuch a different land.\n\nHe paused, his story told, and then his lip quivered as though he\nwould say more, and I believe he intended then and there to yield up\nhis deadly joke on that Highland road and to go forth then with his\nthree blank slips of paper, perhaps to a felon's cell, with one more\nmurder added to his crimes, but harmless at last to man. I therefore\nhurried on, and only heard him mumbling sadly behind me, standing\nbowed and broken, all alone in the twilight, perhaps telling over and\nover even then the last infernal joke.\n\n\n                               THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tales of Wonder, by \nBaron Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett Dunsany\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TALES OF WONDER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 13821-8.txt or 13821-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/8/2/13821/\n\nProduced by Tom Harris.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
