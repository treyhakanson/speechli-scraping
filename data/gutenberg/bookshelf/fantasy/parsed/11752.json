Especially among his later\nbooks does the scheme of each seem to dovetail into the scheme of the\nother and the whole of his writing take on the character of an\nuninterrupted discourse. To this phenomenon, which is at once a fact and\nan illusion of continuity, Mr. Cabell himself has consciously\ncontributed, not only by a subtly elaborate use of conjunctions, by\nrepetition, and by reintroducing characters from his other books, but by\nactually setting his expertness in genealogy to the genial task of\ndevising a family tree for his figures of fiction.\n\nIf this were an actual continuity, more tangible than that fluid\nabstraction we call the life force; if it were merely a tireless\nreiteration and recasting of characters, Mr. Cabell's work would have an\nunbearable monotony. But at bottom this apparent continuity has no more\nmaterial existence than has the thread of lineal descent. To insist\nupon its importance is to obscure, as has been obscured, the epic range\nof Mr. Cabell's creative genius. It is to fail to observe that he has\ntreated in his many books every mainspring of human action and that his\nthemes have been the cardinal dreams and impulses which have in them\nheroic qualities. Each separate volume has a unity and harmony of a\ncomplete and separate life, for the excellent reason that with the\nconsummate skill of an artist he is concerned exclusively in each book\nwith one definite heroic impulse and its frustrations.\n\nIt is true, of course, that like the fruit of the tree of life, Mr.\nCabell's artistic progeny sprang from a first conceptual germ--\"In the\nbeginning was the Word.\" That animating idea is the assumption that if\nlife may be said to have an aim it must be an aim to terminate in\nsuccess and splendor. It postulates the high, fine importance of excess,\nthe choice or discovery of an overwhelming impulse in life and a\nconscientious dedication to its fullest realization. It is the quality\nand intensity of the dream only which raises men above the biological\nnorm; and it is fidelity to the dream which differentiates the\nexceptional figure, the man of heroic stature, from the muddling,\naimless mediocrities about him. What the dream is, matters not at\nall--it may be a dream of sainthood, kingship, love, art, asceticism or\nsensual pleasure--so long as it is fully expressed with all the\nresources of self. It is this sort of completion which Mr. Cabell has\nelected to depict in all his work: the complete sensualist in\nDemetrios, the complete phrase-maker in Felix Kennaston, the complete\npoet in Marlowe, the complete lover in Perion. In each he has shown that\nthis complete self-expression is achieved at the expense of all other\npossible selves, and that herein lies the tragedy of the ideal.\nPerfection is a costly flower and is cultured only by an uncompromising,\nstrict husbandry.\n\nAll this is, we see, the ideational gonfalon under which surge the\nromanticists; but from the evidence at hand it is the banner to which\nlife also bears allegiance. It is in humanity's records that it has\nreserved its honors for its romantic figures. It remembers its Caesars,\nits saints, its sinners. It applauds, with a complete suspension of\nmoral judgment, its heroines and its heroes who achieve the greatest\nself-realization. And from the splendid triumphs and tragic defeats of\nhumanity's individual strivings have come our heritage of wisdom and of\npoetry.\n\nOnce we understand the fundamentals of Mr. Cabell's artistic aims, it is\nnot easy to escape the fact that in _Figures of Earth_ he undertook the\nstaggering and almost unsuspected task of rewriting humanity's sacred\nbooks, just as in _Jurgen_ he gave us a stupendous analogue of the\nceaseless quest for beauty. For we must accept the truth that Mr. Cabell\nis not a novelist at all in the common acceptance of the term, but a\nhistorian of the human soul. His books are neither documentary nor\nrepresentational; his characters are symbols of human desires and\nmotives. By the not at all simple process of recording faithfully the\nprojections of his rich and varied imagination, he has written thirteen\nbooks, which he accurately terms biography, wherein is the bitter-sweet\ntruth about human life.\n\n\nII\n\nAmong the scant certainties vouchsafed us is that every age lives by its\nspecial catchwords. Whether from rebellion against the irking monotony\nof its inherited creeds or from compulsions generated by its own\ncomplexities, each age develops its code of convenient illusions which\nminimize cerebration in dilemmas of conduct by postulating an\nunequivocal cleavage between the current right and the current wrong. It\nworks until men tire of it or challenge the cleavage, or until\nconditions render the code obsolete. It has in it, happily, a certain\npoetic merit always; it presents an ideal to be lived up to; it gives\ndirection to the uncertain, stray impulses of life.\n\nThe Chivalric code is no worse than most and certainly it is prettier\nthan some. It is a code peculiar to an age, or at least it flourishes\nbest in an age wherein sentiment and the stuff of dreams are easily\ntranslatable into action. Its requirements are less of the intellect\nthan of the heart. It puts God, honor, and mistress above all else, and\nstipulates that a knight shall serve these three without any\nreservation. It requires of its secular practitioners the holy virtues\nof an active piety, a modified chastity, and an unqualified obedience,\nat all events, to the categorical imperative. The obligation of poverty\nit omits, for the code arose at a time when the spiritual snobbery of\nthe meek and lowly was not pressing the simile about the camel and the\neye of the needle. It leads to charming manners and to delicate\namenities. It is the opposite of the code of Gallantry, for while the\ncode of Chivalry takes everything with a becoming seriousness, the code\nof Gallantry takes everything with a wink. If one should stoop to pick\nflaws with the Chivalric ideal, it would be to point out a certain\npriggishness and intolerance. For, while it is all very well for one to\ncherish the delusion that he is God's vicar on earth and to go about his\nFather's business armed with a shining rectitude, yet the unhallowed may\nbe moved to deprecate the enterprise when they recall, with discomfort,\nthe zealous vicarship of, say, the late Anthony J. Comstock.\n\nBut here I blunder into Mr. Cabell's province. For he has joined many\ngraceful words in delectable and poignant proof of just that lamentable\ntendency of man to make a mess of even his most immaculate conceivings.\nWhen he wrote _Chivalry_, Mr. Cabell was yet young enough to view the\ncode less with the appraising eye of a pawnbroker than with the ardent\neye of an amateur. He knew its value, but he did not know its price. So\nhe made of it the thesis for a dizain of beautiful happenings that are\nalmost flawless in their verbal beauty.\n\n\nIII\n\nIt is perhaps of historical interest here to record the esteem in which\nMark Twain held the genius of Mr. Cabell as it was manifested as early\nas a dozen years ago. Mr. Cabell wrote _The Soul of Melicent_, or, as it\nwas rechristened on revision, _Domnei_, at the great humorist's request,\nand during the long days and nights of his last illness it was Mr.\nCabell's books which gave Mark Twain his greatest joy. This knowledge\nmitigates the pleasure, no doubt, of those who still, after his fifteen\nyears of writing, encounter him intermittently with a feeling of having\nmade a great literary discovery. The truth is that Mr. Cabell has been\ndiscovered over and over with each succeeding book from that first fine\nenthusiasm with which Percival Pollard reviewed _The Eagle's Shadow_ to\nthat generous acknowledgment by Hugh Walpole that no one in England,\nsave perhaps Conrad and Hardy, was so sure of literary permanence as\nJames Branch Cabell.\n\nWith _The Cream of the Jest, Beyond Life_, and _Figures of Earth_ before\nhim, it is not easy for the perceptive critic to doubt this permanence.\nOne might as sensibly deny a future to Ecclesiastes, _The Golden Ass,\nGulliver's Travels_, and the works of Rabelais as to predict oblivion\nfor such a thesaurus of ironic wit and fine fantasy, mellow wisdom and\nstrange beauty as _Jurgen_. But to appreciate the tales of _Chivalry_\nis, it seems, a gift more frequently reserved for the general reader\nthan for the professional literary evaluator. Certainly years before\ndiscussion of Cabell was artificially augmented by the suppression of\n_Jurgen_ there were many genuine lovers of romance who had read these\ntales with pure enjoyment. That they did not analyse and articulate\ntheir enjoyment for the edification of others does not lessen the\nquality of their appreciation. Even in those years they found in\nCabell's early tales what we find who have since been directed to them\nby the curiosity engendered by his later work, namely, a superb\ncraftsmanship in recreating a vanished age, an atmosphere in keeping\nwith the themes, a fluid, graceful, personal style, a poetic ecstasy, a\nfine sense of drama, and a unity and symmetry which are the hall-marks\nof literary genius.\n\nBURTON RASCOE. New York City, September, 1921.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nPRECAUTIONAL\n\nTHE PROLOGUE\n\n\n   I    THE STORY OF THE SESTINA\n\n  II    THE STORY OF THE TENSON\n\n III    THE STORY OF THE RAT-TRAP\n\n  IV    THE STORY OF THE CHOICES\n\n   V    THE STORY OF THE HOUSEWIFE\n\n  VI    THE STORY OF THE SATRAPS\n\n VII    THE STORY OF THE HERITAGE\n\nVIII    THE STORY OF THE SCABBARD\n\n  IX    THE STORY OF THE NAVARRESE\n\n   X    THE STORY OF THE FOX-BRUSH\n\n        THE EPILOGUE\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecautional\n\n\nImprimis, as concerns the authenticity of these tales perhaps the less\ndebate may be the higher wisdom, if only because this Nicolas de Caen,\nby common report, was never a Gradgrindian. And in this volume in\nparticular, writing it (as Nicolas is supposed to have done) in 1470, as\na dependant on the Duke of Burgundy, it were but human nature should he,\nin dealing with the putative descendants of Dom Manuel and Alianora of\nProvence, be niggardly in his ascription of praiseworthy traits to any\nmember of the house of Lancaster or of Valois. Rather must one in common\nreason accept old Nicolas as confessedly a partisan writer, who upon\noccasion will recolor an event with such nuances as will be least\ninconvenient to a Yorkist and Burgundian bias.\n\nThe reteller of these stories needs in addition to plead guilty of\nhaving abridged the tales with a free hand. Item, these tales have been\na trifle pulled about, most notably in \"The Story of the Satraps,\" where\nit seemed advantageous, on reflection, to put into Gloucester's mouth a\nhistory which in the original version was related _ab ovo_, and as a\nsort of bungling prologue to the story proper.\n\nItem, the re-teller of these stories desires hereby to tender\nappropriate acknowledgment to Mr. R.E. Townsend for his assistance in\nmaking an English version of the lyrics included hereinafter; and to\navoid discussion as to how freely, in these lyrics, Nicolas has\nplagiarized from Raimbaut de Vaqueiras and other elder poets.[1]\n\nAnd--\"sixth and lastly\"--should confession be made that in the present\nrendering a purely arbitrary title has been assigned this little book;\nchiefly for commercial reasons, since the word \"dizain\" has been\nadjudged both untranslatable and, in its pristine form, repellantly\n_outr\u00e9_.\n\n\n2\n\nYou are to give my titular makeshift, then, a wide interpretation; and\nare always to remember that in the bleak, florid age these tales\ncommemorate this Chivalry was much the rarelier significant of any\npersonal trait than of a world-wide code in consonance with which all\nestimable people lived and died. Its root was the assumption\n(uncontested then) that a gentleman will always serve his God, his honor\nand his lady without any reservation; nor did the many emanating by-laws\never deal with special cases as concerns this triple, fixed, and\nfundamental homage.\n\n\n\nSuch is the trinity served hereinafter. Now about lady-service, or\n_domnei_, I have written elsewhere. Elsewhere also I find it recorded\nthat \"the cornerstone of Chivalry is the idea of vicarship: for the\nchivalrous person is, in his own eyes at least, the child of God, and\ngoes about this world as his Father's representative in an alien\ncountry.\"\n\nI believe the definition holds: it certainly tends to explain the\notherwise puzzling pertinacity with which the characters in these tales\ntalk about God and act upon an assured knowledge as to Heaven's private\nintentions and preferences. These people are the members of one family\nengrossed, as all of us are apt to be when in the society of our kin, by\nfamily matters and traditions and by-words. It is not merely that they\nare all large children consciously dependent in all things upon a not\nfoolishly indulgent Father, Who keeps an interested eye upon the least\nof their doings, and punishes at need,--not merely that they know\nthemselves to act under surveillance and to speak within ear-shot of a\ndivine eavesdropper. The point is, rather, that they know this\nobservation to be as tender, the punishment to be as unwilling, as that\nwhich they themselves extend to their own children's pranks and\nmisdemeanors. The point is that to them Heaven is a place as actual and\ntangible as we consider Alaska or Algiers to be, and that their living\nis a conscious journeying toward this actual place. The point is that\nthe Father is a real father, and not a word spelt with capital letters\nin the Church Service; not an abstraction, not a sort of a something\nvaguely describable as \"the Life Force,\" but a very famous kinsman, of\nwhom one is na\u00efvely proud, and whom one is on the way to visit.... The\npoint, in brief, is that His honor and yours are inextricably blended,\nand are both implicated in your behavior on the journey.\n\nWe nowadays can just cloudily imagine this viewing of life as a sort of\nboarding-school from which one eventually goes home, with an official\nreport as to progress and deportment: and in retaliation for being\ndebarred from the comforts of this view, the psychoanalysts have no\ndoubt invented for it some opprobrious explanation. At all events, this\nChivalry was a pragmatic hypothesis: it \"worked,\" and served society for\na long while, not faultlessly of course, but by creating, like all the\nother codes of human conduct which men have yet tried, a tragi-comic\nm\u00eal\u00e9e wherein contended \"courtesy and humanity, friendliness, hardihood,\nlove and friendship, and murder, hate, and virtue, and sin.\"\n\n\n3\n\nFor the rest, since good wine needs no bush, and an inferior beverage is\nnot likely to be bettered by arboreal adornment, I elect to piece out\nmy exordium (however lamely) with \"The Printer's Preface.\" And it runs\nin this fashion:\n\n\"Here begins the volume called and entitled the Dizain of Queens,\ncomposed and extracted from divers chronicles and other sources of\ninformation, by that extremely venerable person and worshipful man,\nMessire Nicolas de Caen, priest and chaplain to the right noble,\nglorious and mighty prince in his time, Philippe, Duke of Burgundy, of\nBrabant, etc., in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord God a thousand\nfour hundred and seventy: and imprinted by me, Colard Mansion, at\nBruges, in the year of our said Lord God a thousand four hundred and\nseventy-one; at the commandment of the right high, mighty and virtuous\nPrincess, my redoubted Lady, Isabella of Portugal, by the grace of God\nDuchess of Burgundy and Lotharingia, of Brabant and Limbourg, of\nLuxembourg and of Gueldres, Countess of Flanders, of Artois, and of\nBurgundy, Palatine of Hainault, of Holland, of Zealand and of Namur,\nMarquesse of the Holy Empire, and Lady of Frisia, of Salins and of\nMechlin; whom I beseech Almighty God less to increase than to continue\nin her virtuous disposition in this world, and after our poor fleet\nexistence to receive eternally. Amen.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE\n\n\n  \"_Afin que les entreprises honorables et les nobles aventures et\n  faicts d'armes soyent noblement enregistr\u00e9s et conserv\u00e9s, je vais\n  traiter et raconter et inventer ung galimatias_.\"\n\nTHE DIZAIN OF QUEENS OF THAT NOBLE MAKER IN THE FRENCH TONGUE, MESSIRE\nNICOLAS DE CAEN, DEDICATED TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ISABELLA OF PORTUGAL,\nOF THE HOUSE OF THE INDOMITABLE ALFONSO HENRIQUES, AND DUCHESS DOWAGER\nOF BURGUNDY. HERE BEGINS IN AUSPICIOUS WISE THE PROLOGUE.\n\n\n\n\nThe Prologue\n\nA Sa Dame\n\n\nInasmuch as it was by your command, illustrious and exalted lady, that I\nhave gathered together these stories to form the present little book,\nyou should the less readily suppose I have presumed to dedicate to your\nSerenity this trivial offering because of my esteeming it to be not\nundeserving of your acceptance. The truth is otherwise: your postulant\napproaches not spurred toward you by vainglory, but rather by equity,\nand equity's plain need to acknowledge that he who seeks to write of\nnoble ladies must necessarily implore at outset the patronage of her who\nis the light and mainstay of our age. I humbly bring my book to you as\nPhidyle approached another and less sacred shrine, _farre pio et\nsaliente mica_, and lay before you this my valueless mean tribute not as\nappropriate to you but as the best I have to offer.\n\nIt is a little book wherein I treat of divers queens and of their\nlove-business; and with necessitated candor I concede my chosen field to\nhave been harvested, and scrupulously gleaned, by many writers of\ninnumerable conditions. Since Dares Phrygius wrote of Queen Heleine, and\nVirgil (that shrewd necromancer) of Queen Dido, a preponderating mass of\nclerks, in casting about for high and serious matter, have chosen, as\nthough it were by common instinct, to dilate upon the amours of royal\nwomen. Even in romance we scribblers must contrive it so that the fair\nNicolete shall be discovered in the end to be no less than the King's\ndaughter of Carthage, and that Sir Do\u00f6n of Mayence shall never sink in\nhis love affairs beneath the degree of a Saracen princess; and we are\nbacked in this old procedure not only by the authority of Aristotle but,\noddly enough, by that of reason.\n\nKings have their policies and wars wherewith to drug each human\nappetite. But their consorts are denied these makeshifts; and love may\nrationally be defined as the pivot of each normal woman's life, and in\nconsequence as the arbiter of that ensuing life which is eternal.\nBecause--as anciently Propertius demanded, though not, to speak the\ntruth, of any woman--\n\n  Quo fugis? ah demens! nulla est fuga, tu licet usque\n  Ad Tanaim fugias, usque sequetur amor.\n\nAnd a dairymaid, let us say, may love whom she will, and nobody else be\na penny the worse for her mistaking of the preferable nail whereon to\nhang her affections; whereas with a queen this choice is more\nportentous. She plays the game of life upon a loftier table, ruthlessly\nilluminated, she stakes by her least movement a tall pile of counters,\nsome of which are, of necessity, the lives and happiness of persons whom\nshe knows not, unless it be by vague report. Grandeur sells itself at\nthis hard price, and at no other. A queen must always play, in fine, as\nthe vicar of destiny, free to choose but very certainly compelled in the\nensuing action to justify that choice: as is strikingly manifested by\nthe authentic histories of Brunhalt, and of Guenevere, and of swart\nCleopatra, and of many others that were born to the barbaric queenhoods\nof extinct and dusty times.\n\nAll royal persons are (I take it) the immediate and the responsible\nstewards of Heaven; and since the nature of each man is like a troubled\nstream, now muddied and now clear, their prayer must ever be, _Defenda\nme, Dios, de me_! Yes, of exalted people, and even of their near\nassociates, life, because it aims more high than the aforementioned\nAristotle, demands upon occasion a more great catharsis, which would\npurge any audience of unmanliness, through pity and through terror,\nbecause, by a quaint paradox, the players have been purged of humanity.\nFor a moment Destiny has thrust her scepter into the hands of a human\nbeing and Chance has exalted a human being to decide the issue of many\nhuman lives. These two--with what immortal chucklings one may facilely\nimagine--have left the weakling thus enthroned, free to direct the heavy\noutcome, free to choose, and free to evoke much happiness or age-long\nweeping, but with no intermediate course unbarred. _Now prove thyself_!\nsaith Destiny; and Chance appends: _Now prove thyself to be at bottom a\ngod or else a beast, and now eternally abide that choice. And now_ (O\ncrowning irony!) _we may not tell thee clearly by which choice thou\nmayst prove either_.\n\nIn this little book about the women who intermarried, not very enviably,\nwith an unhuman race (a race predestinate to the red ending which I have\nchronicled elsewhere, in _The Red Cuckold_), it is of ten such moments\nthat I treat.\n\nYou alone, I think, of all persons living, have learned, as you have\nsettled by so many instances, to rise above mortality in such a testing,\nand unfailingly to merit by your conduct the plaudits and the adoration\nof our otherwise dissentient world. You have often spoken in the stead\nof Destiny, with nations to abide your verdict; and in so doing have\nboth graced and hallowed your high vicarship. If I forbear to speak of\nthis at greater length, it is because I dare not couple your well-known\nperfection with any imperfect encomium. Upon no plea, however, can any\none forbear to acknowledge that he who seeks to write of noble ladies\nmust necessarily implore at outset the patronage of her who is the light\nand mainstay of our age.\n\n_Therefore to you, madame--most excellent and noble lady, to whom I love\nto owe both loyalty and love--I dedicate this little book._\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n_THE STORY OF THE SESTINA_\n\n\n  \"Armatz de fust e de fer e d'acier, Mos ostal seran bosc, fregz,\n  e semdier, E mas cansos sestinas e descortz, E mantenrai los frevols\n  contra 'ls fortz.\"\n\nTHE FIRST NOVEL.--ALIANORA OF PROVENCE, COMING IN DISGUISE AND IN\nADVERSITY TO A CERTAIN CLERK, IS BY HIM CONDUCTED ACROSS A HOSTILE\nCOUNTRY; AND IN THAT TROUBLED JOURNEY ARE MADE MANIFEST TO EACH THE\nSNARES WHICH HAD BEGUILED THEM AFORETIME.\n\n\n\n\nThe Story of the Sestina\n\n\nIn this place we have to do with the opening tale of the Dizain of\nQueens. I abridge, as afterward, at discretion; and an initial account\nof the Barons' War, among other superfluities, I amputate as more\nremarkable for veracity than interest. The result, we will agree at\noutset, is that to the Norman cleric appertains whatever these tales may\nhave of merit, whereas what you find distasteful in them you must impute\nto my delinquencies in skill rather than in volition.\n\nWithin the half hour after de Giars' death (here one overtakes Nicolas\nmid-course in narrative) Dame Alianora thus stood alone in the corridor\nof a strange house. Beyond the arras the steward and his lord were at\nirritable converse.\n\nFirst, \"If the woman be hungry,\" spoke a high and peevish voice, \"feed\nher. If she need money, give it to her. But do not annoy me.\"\n\n\"This woman demands to see the master of the house,\" the steward then\nretorted.\n\n\"O incredible Boeotian, inform her that the master of the house has no\ntime to waste upon vagabonds who select the middle of the night as an\neligible time to pop out of nowhere. Why did you not do so in the\nbeginning, you dolt?\" The speaker got for answer only a deferential\ncough, and very shortly continued: \"This is remarkably vexatious. _Vox\net praeterea nihil_--which signifies, Yeck, that to converse with women\nis always delightful. Admit her.\" This was done, and Dame Alianora came\ninto an apartment littered with papers, where a neat and shriveled\ngentleman of fifty-odd sat at a desk and scowled.\n\nHe presently said, \"You may go, Yeck.\" He had risen, the magisterial\nattitude with which he had awaited her entrance cast aside. \"Oh, God!\"\nhe said; \"you, madame!\" His thin hands, scholarly hands, were plucking\nat the air.\n\nDame Alianora had paused, greatly astonished, and there was an interval\nbefore she said, \"I do not recognize you, messire.\"\n\n\"And yet, madame, I recall very clearly that some thirty years ago the\nKing-Count Raymond B\u00e9renger, then reigning in Provence, had about his\ncourt four daughters, each one of whom was afterward wedded to a king.\nFirst, Meregrett, the eldest, now regnant in France; then Alianora, the\nsecond and most beautiful of these daughters, whom troubadours hymned as\nthe Unattainable Princess. She was married a long while ago, madame, to\nthe King of England, Lord Henry, third of that name to reign in these\nislands.\"\n\nDame Alianora's eyes were narrowing. \"There is something in your voice,\"\nshe said, \"which I recall.\"\n\nHe answered: \"Madame and Queen, that is very likely, for it is a voice\nwhich sang a deal in Provence when both of us were younger. I concede\nwith the Roman that I have somewhat deteriorated since the reign of\nCynara. Yet have you quite forgotten the Englishman who made so many\nsongs of you? They called him Osmund Heleigh.\"\n\n\"He made the Sestina of Spring which won the violet crown at my\nbetrothal,\" the Queen said; and then, with eagerness: \"Messire, can it\nbe that you are Osmund Heleigh?\" He shrugged assent. She looked at him\nfor a long time, rather sadly, and demanded if he were the King's man or\nof the barons' party.\n\nThe nervous hands were raised in deprecation. \"I have no politics,\"\nMessire Heleigh began, and altered it, gallantly enough, to, \"I am the\nQueen's man, madame.\"\n\n\"Then aid me, Osmund,\" she said.\n\nHe answered with a gravity which singularly became him, \"You have reason\nto understand that to my fullest power I will aid you.\"\n\n\"You know that at Lewes these swine overcame us.\" He nodded assent. \"Now\nthey hold the King, my husband, captive at Kenilworth. I am content\nthat he remain there, for he is of all the King's enemies the most\ndangerous. But, at Wallingford, Leicester has imprisoned my son, Prince\nEdward. The Prince must be freed, my Osmund. Warren de Basingbourne\ncommands what is left of the royal army, now entrenched at Bristol, and\nit is he who must liberate my son. Get me to Bristol, then. Afterward we\nwill take Wallingford.\" The Queen issued these orders in cheery,\npractical fashion, and did not admit opposition into the account, for\nshe was a capable woman.\n\n\"But you, madame?\" he stammered. \"You came alone?\"\n\n\"I come from France, where I have been entreating--and vainly\nentreating--succor from yet another monkish king, the holy Lewis of that\nrealm. Eh, what is God about when He enthrones these whining pieties!\nWere I a king, were I even a man, I would drive these smug English out\nof their foggy isle in three days' space! I would leave alive not one of\nthese curs that dare yelp at me! I would--\" She paused, anger veering\ninto amusement. \"See how I enrage myself when I think of what your\npeople have made me suffer,\" the Queen said, and shrugged her shoulders.\n\"In effect, I skulked back in disguise to this detestable island,\naccompanied by Avenel de Giars and Hubert Fitz-Herveis. To-night some\nhalf-dozen fellows--robbers, thorough knaves, like all you\nEnglish,--attacked us on the common yonder and slew the men of our\nparty. While they were cutting de Giars' throat I slipped away in the\ndark and tumbled through many ditches till I spied your light. There you\nhave my story. Now get me an escort to Bristol.\"\n\nIt was a long while before Messire Heleigh spoke. Then, \"These men,\" he\nsaid--\"this de Giars and this Fitz-Herveis--they gave their lives for\nyours, as I understand it,--_pro caris amicis_. And yet you do not\ngrieve for them.\"\n\n\"I shall regret de Giars,\" the Queen acknowledged, \"for he made\nexcellent songs. But Fitz-Herveis?--foh! the man had a face like a\nhorse.\" Again her mood changed. \"Many persons have died for me, my\nfriend. At first I wept for them, but now I am dry of tears.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Cato very wisely says, 'If thou hast need of help,\nask it of thy friends.' But the sweet friend that I remember was a clean\neyed girl, joyous and exceedingly beautiful. Now you appear to me one of\nthose ladies of remoter times--Faustina, or Jael, or Artemis, the King's\nwife of Tauris,--they that slew men, laughing. I am somewhat afraid of\nyou, madame.\"\n\nShe was angry at first; then her face softened. \"You English!\" she said,\nonly half mirthful. \"Eh, my God! you remember me when I was a high\nhearted young sorceress. Now the powers of the Apsarasas have departed\nfrom me, and time has thrust that Alianora, who was once the\nUnattainable Princess, chin deep in misery. Yet even now I am your\nQueen, messire, and it is not yours to pass judgment upon me.\" \"I do\nnot judge you,\" he returned. \"Rather I cry with him of old, _Omnia\nincerta ratione!_ and I cry with Salomon that he who meddles with the\nstrife of another man is like to him that takes a hound by the ears. Yet\nlisten, madame and Queen. I cannot afford you an escort to Bristol. This\nhouse, of which I am in temporary charge, is Longaville, my brother's\nmanor. Lord Brudenel, as you doubtless know, is of the barons' party\nand--scant cause for grief!--is with Leicester at this moment. I can\ntrust none of my brother's people, for I believe them to be of much the\nsame opinion as those Londoners who not long ago stoned you and would\nhave sunk your barge in Thames River. Oh, let us not blink the fact that\nyou are not overbeloved in England. So an escort is out of the question.\nYet I, madame, if you so elect, will see you safe to Bristol.\"\n\n\"You? Singly?\" the Queen demanded.\n\n\"My plan is this: Singing folk alone travel whither they will. We will\ngo as jongleurs, then. I can yet manage a song to the viol, I dare\naffirm. And you must pass as my wife.\"\n\nHe said this with simplicity. The plan seemed unreasonable, and at first\nDame Alianora waved it aside. Out of the question! But reflection\nsuggested nothing better; it was impossible to remain at Longaville, and\nthe man spoke sober truth when he declared any escort other than himself\nto be unprocurable. Besides, the lunar madness of the scheme was its\nstrength; that the Queen would venture to cross half England\nunprotected--and Messire Heleigh on the face of him was a paste-board\nbuckler--was an event which Leicester would neither anticipate nor on\nreport credit. There you were! these English had no imagination. The\nQueen snapped her fingers and said: \"Very willingly will I be your wife,\nmy Osmund. But how do I know that I can trust you? Leicester would give\na deal for me; he would pay any price for the pious joy of burning the\nSorceress of Provence. And you are not wealthy, I suspect.\"\n\n\"You may trust me, mon bel esper,\"--his eyes here were those of a beaten\nchild--\"because my memory is better than yours.\" Messire Osmund Heleigh\ngathered his papers into a neat pile. \"This room is mine. To-night I\nkeep guard in the corridor, madame. We will start at dawn.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Dame Alianora laughed contentedly. \"Mon bel esper! my\nfairest hope! The man called me that in his verses--thirty years ago!\nYes, I may trust you, my poor Osmund.\"\n\nSo they set out at cockcrow. He had procured for himself a viol and a\nlong falchion, and had somewhere got suitable clothes for the Queen; and\nin their aging but decent garb the two approached near enough to the\nappearance of what they desired to be thought. In the courtyard a knot\nof servants gaped, nudged one another, but openly said nothing. Messire\nHeleigh, as they interpreted it, was brazening out an affair of\ngallantry before the countryside; and they esteemed his casual\nobservation that they would find a couple of dead men on the common\nexceedingly diverting.\n\nWhen the Queen asked him the same morning, \"And what will you sing, my\nOsmund? Shall we begin the practise of our new profession with the\nSestina of Spring?\"--old Osmund Heleigh grunted out: \"I have forgotten\nthat rubbish long ago. _Omnis amans, amens_, saith the satirist of Rome\ntown, and with reason.\"\n\nFollowed silence.\n\nOne sees them thus trudging the brown, naked plains under a sky of\nsteel. In a pageant the woman, full-veined and comely, her russet gown\ngirded up like a harvester's might not inaptly have prefigured October;\nand for less comfortable November you could nowhere have found a symbol\nmore precise than her lank companion, humorously peevish under his white\nthatch of hair, and constantly fretted by the sword tapping at his\nankles.\n\nThey made Hurlburt prosperously and found it vacant, for the news of\nFalmouth's advance had driven the villagers hillward. There was in this\nplace a child, a naked boy of some two years, lying on a doorstep,\noverlooked in his elders' gross terror. As the Queen with a sob lifted\nthis boy the child died.\n\n\"Starved!\" said Osmund Heleigh; \"and within a stone's throw of my snug\nhome!\"\n\nThe Queen laid down the tiny corpse, and, stooping, lightly caressed\nits sparse flaxen hair. She answered nothing, though her lips moved.\n\nPast Vachel, scene of a recent skirmish, with many dead in the gutters,\nthey were overtaken by Falmouth himself, and stood at the roadside to\nafford his troop passage. The Marquess, as he went by, flung the Queen a\ncoin, with a jest sufficiently high flavored. She knew the man her\ninveterate enemy, knew that on recognition he would have killed her as\nhe would a wolf; she smiled at him and dropped a curtsey.\n\n\"This is remarkable,\" Messire Heleigh observed. \"I was hideously afraid,\nand am yet shaking. But you, madame, laughed.\"\n\nThe Queen replied: \"I laughed because I know that some day I shall have\nLord Falmouth's head. It will be very sweet to see it roll in the dust,\nmy Osmund.\"\n\nMessire Heleigh somewhat dryly observed that tastes differed.\n\nAt Jessop Minor befell a more threatening adventure. Seeking food at the\n_Cat and Hautbois_ in that village, they blundered upon the same troop\nat dinner in the square about the inn. Falmouth and his lieutenants were\nsomewhere inside the house. The men greeted the supposed purveyors of\namusement with a shout; and one of these soldiers--a swarthy rascal with\nhis head tied in a napkin--demanded that the jongleurs grace their meal\nwith a song.\n\nOsmund tried to put him off with a tale of a broken viol.\n\nBut, \"Haro!\" the fellow blustered; \"by blood and by nails! you will sing\nmore sweetly with a broken viol than with a broken head. I would have\nyou understand, you hedge thief, that we gentlemen of the sword are not\npartial to wordy argument.\" Messire Heleigh fluttered inefficient hands\nas the men-at-arms gathered about them, scenting some genial piece of\ncruelty. \"Oh, you rabbit!\" the trooper jeered, and caught at Osmund's\nthroat, shaking him. In the act this rascal tore open Messire Heleigh's\ntunic, disclosing a thin chain about his neck and a handsome locket,\nwhich the fellow wrested from its fastening. \"Ahoi!\" he continued.\n\"Ahoi, my comrades, what sort of minstrel is this, who goes about\nEngland all hung with gold like a Cathedral Virgin! He and his\nsweetheart\"--the actual word was grosser--\"will be none the worse for an\ninterview with the Marquess.\"\n\nThe situation smacked of awkwardness, because Lord Falmouth was familiar\nwith the Queen, and to be brought specifically to his attention meant\ndeath for two detected masqueraders. Hastily Osmund Heleigh said:\n\n\"Messire, the locket contains the portrait of a lady whom in my youth I\nloved very greatly. Save to me, it is valueless. I pray you, do not rob\nme of it.\"\n\nBut the trooper shook his head with drunken solemnity. \"I do not like\nthe looks of this. Yet I will sell it to you, as the saying is, for a\nsong.\"\n\n\"It shall be the king of songs,\" said Osmund,--\"the song that Arnaut\nDaniel first made. I will sing for you a Sestina, messieurs,--a Sestina\nin salutation of Spring.\"\n\nThe men disposed themselves about the dying grass, and presently he\nsang.\n\nSang Messire Heleigh:\n\n  \"Awaken! for the servitors of Spring\n  Proclaim his triumph! ah, make haste to see\n  With what tempestuous pageantry they bring\n  The victor homeward! haste, for this is he\n  That cast out Winter and all woes that cling\n  To Winter's garments, and bade April be!\n\n  \"And now that Spring is master, let us be\n  Content, and laugh, as anciently in spring\n  The battle-wearied Tristan laughed, when he\n  Was come again Tintagel-ward, to bring\n  Glad news of Arthur's victory--and see\n  Ysoude, with parted lips, that waver and cling.\n\n  \"Not yet in Brittany must Tristan cling\n  To this or that sad memory, and be\n  Alone, as she in Cornwall; for in spring\n  Love sows against far harvestings,--and he\n  Is blind, and scatters baleful seed that bring\n  Such fruitage as blind Love lacks eyes to see!\"\n\nOsmund paused here for an appreciable interval, staring at the Queen.\nYou saw his flabby throat a-quiver, his eyes melting, saw his cheeks\nkindle, and youth seeping into the lean man like water over a crumbling\ndam. His voice was now big and desirous.\n\nSang Messire Heleigh:\n\n  \"Love sows, but lovers reap; and ye will see\n  The loved eyes lighten, feel the loved lips cling,\n  Never again when in the grave ye be\n  Incurious of your happiness in spring,\n  And get no grace of Love there, whither he\n  That bartered life for love no love may bring.\n\n  \"No braggart Heracles avails to bring\n  Alcestis hence; nor here may Roland see\n  The eyes of Aude; nor here the wakening spring\n  Vex any man with memories: for there be\n  No memories that cling as cerements cling,\n  No force that baffles Death, more strong than he.\n\n  \"Us hath he noted, and for us hath he\n  An hour appointed; and that hour will bring\n  Oblivion.--Then, laugh! Laugh, dear, and see\n  The tyrant mocked, while yet our bosoms cling,\n  While yet our lips obey us, and we be\n  Untrammeled in our little hour of spring!\n\n  \"Thus in the spring we jeer at Death, though he\n  Will see our children perish and will briny\n  Asunder all that cling while love may be.\"\n\nThen Osmund put the viol aside and sat quite silent. The soldiery\njudged, and with cordial frankness stated, that the difficulty of his\nrhyming scheme did not atone for his lack of indecency, but when the\nQueen of England went among them with Messire Heleigh's faded green hat\nshe found them liberal. Even the fellow with the broken head admitted\nthat a bargain was proverbially a bargain, and returned the locket with\nthe addition of a coin. So for the present these two went safe, and\nquitted the _Cat and Hautbois_ fed and unmolested.\n\n\"My Osmund,\" Dame Alianora said, presently, \"your memory is better than\nI had thought.\"\n\n\"I remembered a boy and a girl,\" he returned. \"And I grieved that they\nwere dead.\"\n\nAfterward they plodded on toward Bowater, and the ensuing night rested\nin Chantrell Wood. They had the good fortune there to encounter dry and\nwindless weather and a sufficiency of brushwood, with which Osmund\nconstructed an agreeable fire. In its glow these two sat, eating bread\nand cheese.\n\nBut talk languished at the outset. The Queen had complained of an ague,\nand Messire Heleigh was sedately suggesting three spiders hung about the\nneck as an infallible corrective for this ailment, when Dame Alianora\nrose to her feet. \"Eh, my God!\" she said; \"I am wearied of such\nungracious aid! Not an inch of the way but you have been thinking of\nyour filthy books and longing to be back at them! No; I except the\nmoments when you were frightened into forgetfulness--first by Falmouth,\nthen by the trooper. O Eternal Father! afraid of a single dirty\nsoldier!\"\n\n\"Indeed, I was very much afraid,\" said Messire Heleigh, with perfect\nsimplicity; \"_timidus perire, madame._\"\n\n\"You have not even the grace to be ashamed! Yet I am shamed, messire,\nthat Osmund Heleigh should have become the book-muddled pedant you are.\nFor I loved young Osmund Heleigh.\"\n\nHe also had risen in the firelight, and now its convulsive shadows\nmarred two dogged faces. \"I think it best not to recall that boy and\ngirl who are so long dead. And, frankly, madame and Queen, the merit of\nthe business I have in hand is questionable. It is you who have set all\nEngland by the ears, and I am guiding you toward opportunities for\nfurther mischief. I must serve you. Understand, madame, that ancient\nfolly in Provence yonder has nothing to do with the affair. Count Manuel\nleft you: and between his evasion and your marriage you were pleased to\namuse yourself with me--\"\n\n\"You were more civil then, my Osmund--\"\n\n\"I am not uncivil, I merely point out that this old folly constitutes\nno overwhelming obligation, either way. I cry _nihil ad Andromachen!_\nFor the rest, I must serve you because you are a woman and helpless; yet\nI cannot forget that he who spares the wolf is the sheep's murderer. It\nwould be better for all England if you were dead. Hey, your gorgeous\nfollies, madame! Silver peacocks set with sapphires! Cloth of fine\ngold--\"\n\n\"Would you have me go unclothed?\" Dame Alianora demanded, pettishly.\n\n\"Not so,\" Osmund retorted; \"again I say to you with Tertullian, 'Let\nwomen paint their eyes with the tints of chastity, insert into their\nears the Word of God, tie the yoke of Christ about their necks, and\nadorn their whole person with the silk of sanctity and the damask of\ndevotion.' I say to you that the boy you wish to rescue from\nWallingford, and make King of England, is freely rumored to be not\nverily the son of Sire Henry but the child of tall Manuel of Poictesme.\nI say to you that from the first you have made mischief in England. And\nI say to you--\"\n\nBut Dame Alianora was yawning quite frankly. \"You will say to me that I\nbrought foreigners into England, that I misguided the King, that I\nstirred up strife between the King and his barons. Eh, my God! I am\nsufficiently familiar with the harangue. Yet listen, my Osmund: They\nsold me like a bullock to a man I had never seen. I found him a man of\nwax, and I remoulded him. They asked of me an heir for England: I\nprovided that heir. They gave me England as a toy; I played with it. I\nwas the Queen, the source of honor, the source of wealth--the trough, in\neffect, about which swine gathered. Never since I came into England,\nOsmund, has any man or woman loved me; never in all my English life have\nI loved man or woman. Do you understand, my Osmund?--the Queen has many\nflatterers, but no friends. Not a friend in the world, my Osmund! And so\nthe Queen made the best of it and amused herself.\"\n\nSomewhat he seemed to understand, for he answered without asperity:\n\n\"Mon bel esper, I do not find it anywhere in Holy Writ that God requires\nit of us to amuse ourselves; but upon many occasions we have been\ncommanded to live righteously. We are tempted in divers and insidious\nways. And we cry with the Psalmist, 'My strength is dried up like a\npotsherd.' But God intends this, since, until we have here demonstrated\nour valor upon Satan, we are manifestly unworthy to be enregistered in\nGod's army. The great Captain must be served by proven soldiers. We may\nbe tempted, but we may not yield. O daughter of the South! we must not\nyield!\"\n\n\"Again you preach,\" Dame Alianora said. \"That is a venerable truism.\"\n\n\"Ho, madame,\" he returned, \"is it on that account the less true?\"\n\nPensively the Queen considered this. \"You are a good man, my Osmund,\"\nshe said, at last, \"though you are very droll. Ohim\u00e9! it is a pity that\nI was born a princess! Had it been possible for me to be your wife, I\nwould have been a better woman. I shall sleep now and dream of that good\nand stupid and contented woman I might have been.\" So presently these\ntwo slept in Chantrell Wood.\n\nFollowed four days of journeying. As Messer Dante had not yet surveyed\nMalebolge, Osmund Heleigh and Dame Alianora lacked a parallel for that\nwhich they encountered; their traverse discovered England razed,\ncharred, and depopulate--picked bones of an island, a vast and absolute\nruin about which passion-wasted men skulked like rats. Messire Heleigh\nand the Queen traveled without molestation; malice and death had\njourneyed before them on this road, and had swept it clear.\n\nAt every trace of these hideous precessors Osmund Heleigh would say, \"By\na day's ride I might have prevented this.\" Or, \"By a day's ride I might\nhave saved this woman.\" Or, \"By two days' riding I might have fed this\nchild.\"\n\nThe Queen kept Spartan silence, but daily you saw the fine woman age. In\ntheir slow advance every inch of misery was thrust before her for\ninspection; meticulously she observed and evaluated her handiwork.\nEnthroned, she had appraised from a distance the righteous wars she set\nafoot; trudging thus among the d\u00e9bris of these wars, she found they had\nunsuspected aspects. Bastling the royal army had recently sacked.\nThere remained of this village the skeletons of two houses, and for the\nrest a jumble of bricks, rafters half-burned, many calcined fragments of\nhumanity, and ashes. At Bastling, Messire Heleigh turned to the Queen\ntoiling behind.\n\n\"Oh, madame!\" he said, in a dry whisper, \"this was the home of so many\nmen!\"\n\n\"I burned it,\" Dame Alianora replied. \"That man we passed just now I\nkilled. Those other men and women--my folly slew them all. And little\nchildren, my Osmund! The hair like flax, blood-dabbled!\"\n\n\"Oh, madame!\" he wailed, in the extremity of his pity.\n\nFor she stood with eyes shut, all gray. The Queen demanded: \"Why have\nthey not slain me? Was there no man in England to strangle the proud\nwanton? Are you all cowards here?\"\n\nHe said: \"I detect only one coward in the affair. Your men and\nLeicester's men also ride about the world, and draw sword and slay and\ndie for the right as they see it. And you and Leicester contend for the\nright as ye see it. But I, madame! I! I, who sat snug at home spilling\nink and trimming rose-bushes! God's world, madame, and I in it afraid to\nspeak a word for Him! God's world, and a curmudgeon in it grudging God\nthe life He gave!\" The man flung out his soft hands and snarled: _\"We\nare tempted in divers and insidious ways._ But I, who rebuked you!\nbehold, now, with how gross a snare was I entrapped!\" \"I do not\nunderstand, my Osmund.\"\n\n\"I was afraid, madame,\" he returned, dully. \"Everywhere men fight, and I\nam afraid to die.\"\n\nSo they stood silent in the ruins of Bastling.\n\n\"Of a piece with our lives,\" Dame Alianora said at last. \"All ruin, my\nOsmund.\"\n\nBut Messire Heleigh threw back his head and laughed, new color in his\nface. \"Presently men will build here, my Queen. Presently, as in legend\nwas re-born the Arabian bird, arises from these ashes a lordlier and\nmore spacious town.\"\n\nThey went forward. The next day chance loosed upon them Gui Camoys, lord\nof Bozon, Foliot, and Thwenge, who, riding alone through Poges Copse,\nfound there a man and a woman over their limited supper. The woman had\nthrown back her hood, and Camoys drew rein to stare at her. Lispingly he\nspoke the true court dialect.\n\n\"Ma belle,\" said this Camoys, in friendly condescension, \"n'estez vous\npas jongleurs?\"\n\nDame Alianora smiled up at him. \"Ouais, messire; mon mary faict les\nchan\u00e7ons--\" She paused, with dilatory caution, for Camoys had leaped\nfrom his horse, giving a great laugh.\n\n\"A prize! ho, an imperial prize!\" Camoys shouted. \"A peasant woman with\nthe Queen's face, who speaks French! And who, madame, is this? Have you\nby any chance brought pious Lewis from oversea? Have I bagged a brace\nof monarchs?\"\n\nHere was imminent danger, for Camoys had known the Queen some fifteen\nyears. Messire Heleigh rose, his five days' beard glinting like\nhoar-frost as his mouth twitched.\n\n\"I am Osmund Heleigh, messire, younger brother to the Earl of Brudenel.\"\n\n\"I have heard of you, I believe--the fellow who spoils parchment. This\nis odd company, however, Messire Osmund, for Brudenel's brother.\"\n\n\"A gentleman must serve his Queen, messire. As Cicero very justly\nobserves--\"\n\n\"I am inclined to think that his political opinions are scarcely to our\nimmediate purpose. This is a high matter, Messire Heleigh. To let the\nsorceress pass is, of course, out of the question; upon the other hand,\nI observe that you lack weapons of defence. Yet if you will have the\nkindness to assist me in unarming, your courtesy will place our commerce\non more equal footing.\"\n\nOsmund had turned very white. \"I am no swordsman, messire--\"\n\n\"Now, this is not handsome of you,\" Camoys began. \"I warn you that\npeople will speak harshly of us if we lose this opportunity of gaining\nhonor. And besides, the woman will be burned at the stake. Plainly, you\nowe it to all three of us to fight.\"\n\n\"--But I refer my cause to God. I am quite at your service.\" \"No, my\nOsmund!\" Dame Alianora then cried. \"It means your death.\"\n\nHe spread out his hands. \"That is God's affair, madame.\"\n\n\"Are you not afraid?\" she breathed.\n\n\"Of course I am afraid,\" said Messire Heleigh, irritably.\n\nAfter that he unarmed Camoys, and presently they faced each other in\ntheir tunics. So for the first time in the journey Osmund's long\nfalchion saw daylight. He had thrown away his dagger, as Camoys had\nnone.\n\nThe combat was sufficiently curious. Camoys raised his left hand. \"So\nhelp me God and His saints, I have upon me neither bone, stone, nor\nwitchcraft wherethrough the power and the word of God might be\ndiminished or the devil's power increased.\"\n\nOsmund made similar oath. \"Judge Thou this woman's cause!\" he cried,\nlikewise.\n\nThen Gui Camoys shouted, as a herald might have done, \"Laissez les\naller, laissez les aller, laissez les aller, les bons combatants!\" and\nwarily each moved toward the other.\n\nOn a sudden Osmund attacked, desperately apprehensive of his own\ncowardice. Camoys lightly eluded him and slashed at Osmund's undefended\nthigh, drawing much blood. Osmund gasped. He flung away his sword, and\nin the instant catching Camoys under the arms, threw him to the ground.\nMessire Heleigh fell with his opponent, who in stumbling had lost his\nsword, and thus the two struggled unarmed, Osmund atop. But Camoys was\nthe younger man, and Osmund's strength was ebbing rapidly by reason of\nhis wound. Now Camoys' tethered horse, rearing with nervousness, tumbled\nhis master's flat-topped helmet into the road. Osmund caught up this\nhelmet and with it battered Camoys in the face, dealing severe blows.\n\n\"God!\" Camoys cried, his face all blood.\n\n\"Do you acknowledge my quarrel just?\" said Osmund, between horrid sobs.\n\n\"What choice have I?\" said Gui Camoys, very sensibly.\n\nSo Osmund rose, blind with tears and shivering. The Queen bound up their\nwounds as best she might, but Camoys was much dissatisfied.\n\n\"For private purposes of His own, madame,\" he observed, \"and doubtless\nfor sufficient reasons, God has singularly favored your cause. I am\nneither a fool nor a pagan to question His decision, and you two may go\nyour way unhampered. But I have had my head broken with my own helmet,\nand this I consider to be a proceeding very little conducive toward\nenhancing my reputation. Of your courtesy, messire, I must entreat\nanother meeting.\"\n\nOsmund shrank as if from a blow. Then, with a short laugh, he conceded\nthat this was Camoys' right, and they fixed upon the following Saturday,\nwith Poges Copse as the rendezvous.\n\n\"I would suggest that the combat be to the death,\" Gui Camoys said, \"in\nconsideration of the fact it was my own helmet. You must undoubtedly be\naware, Messire Osmund, that such an affront is practically without any\nparallel.\"\n\nThis, too, was agreed upon.\n\nThen, after asking if they needed money, which was courteously declined,\nGui Camoys rode away, and sang as he went. Osmund Heleigh remained\nmotionless. He raised quivering hands to the sky.\n\n\"Thou hast judged!\" he cried. \"Thou hast judged, O puissant Emperor of\nHeaven! Now pardon! Pardon us twain! Pardon for unjust stewards of Thy\ngifts! Thou hast loaned this woman dominion over England, with all\ninstruments to aid Thy cause, and this trust she has abused. Thou hast\nloaned me life and manhood, agility and wit and strength, all\ninstruments to aid Thy cause. Talents in a napkin, O God! Repentant we\ncry to Thee. Pardon for unjust stewards! Pardon for the ungirt loin, for\nthe service shirked, for all good deeds undone! Pardon and grace, O King\nof kings!\"\n\nThus he prayed, while Gui Camoys sang, riding deeper into the tattered,\nyellowing forest. By an odd chance Camoys had lighted on that song made\nby Thibaut of Champagne, beginning _Signor, saciez, ki or ne s'en ira_,\nwhich denounces all half-hearted servitors of Heaven; and this he sang\nwith a lilt gayer than his matter countenanced. Faintly there now came\nto Osmund and the Queen the sound of Camoys' singing, and they found it,\nin the circumstances, ominously apt.\n\nSang Camoys:\n\n  \"Et vos, par qui je n'ci onques a\u00efe,\n  Descendez luit en infer le parfont.\"\n\nDame Alianora shivered. But she was a capable woman, and so she said: \"I\nmay have made mistakes. But I am sure I never meant any harm, and I am\nsure, too, that God will be more sensible about it than are you poets.\"\n\nThey slept that night in Ousley Meadow, and the next afternoon came\nsafely to Bristol. You may learn elsewhere with what rejoicing the royal\narmy welcomed the Queen's arrival, how courage quickened at sight of the\ngenerous virago. In the ebullition Messire Heleigh was submerged, and\nDame Alianora saw nothing more of him that day. Friday there were\ncounsels, requisitions, orders signed, a memorial despatched to Pope\nUrban, chief of all a letter (this in the Queen's hand throughout)\nprivily conveyed to the Lady Maude de Mortemer, who shortly afterward\ncontrived Prince Edward's escape from her husband's gaolership. There\nwas much sowing of a seed, in fine, that eventually flowered victory.\nThere was, however, no sign of Osmund Heleigh, though by Dame Alianora's\norder he was sought.\n\nOn Saturday at seven in the morning he came to her lodging, in complete\narmor. From the open helmet his wrinkled face, showing like a wizened\nnut in a shell, smiled upon her questionings.\n\n\"I go to fight Gui Camoys, madame and Queen.\"\n\nDame Alianora wrung her hands. \"You go to your death.\"\n\nHe answered: \"That is true. Therefore I am come to bid you farewell.\"\n\nThe Queen stared at him for a while; on a sudden she broke into a\ncurious fit of deep but tearless sobbing, which bordered upon laughter,\ntoo.\n\n\"Mon bel esper,\" said Osmund Heleigh, gently, \"what is there in all this\nworthy of your sorrow? The man will kill me; granted, for he is my\njunior by some fifteen years, and is in addition a skilled swordsman. I\nfail to see that this is lamentable. Back to Longaville I cannot go\nafter recent happenings; there a rope's end awaits me. Here I must in\nany event shortly take to the sword, since a beleaguered army has very\nlittle need of ink-pots; and shortly I must be slain in some skirmish,\ndug under the ribs perhaps by a greasy fellow I have never seen. I\nprefer a clean death at a gentleman's hands.\"\n\n\"It is I who bring about your death!\" she said. \"You gave me gallant\nservice, and I have requited you with death, and it is a great pity.\"\n\n\"Indeed the debt is on the other side. The trivial services I rendered\nyou were such as any gentleman must render a woman in distress. Naught\nelse have I afforded you, madame, save very anciently a Sestina. Ho, a\nSestina! And in return you have given me a Sestina of fairer make,--a\nSestina of days, six days of manly common living.\" His eyes were\nfervent.\n\nShe kissed him on either cheek. \"Farewell, my champion!\"\n\n\"Ay, your champion. In the twilight of life old Osmund Heleigh rides\nforth to defend the quarrel of Alianora of Provence. Reign wisely, my\nQueen, so that hereafter men may not say I was slain in an evil cause.\nDo not, I pray you, shame my maiden venture at a man's work.\"\n\n\"I will not shame you,\" the Queen proudly said; and then, with a change\nof voice: \"O my Osmund! My Osmund, you have a folly that is divine, and\nI lack it.\"\n\nHe caught her by each wrist, and stood crushing both her hands to his\nlips, with fierce staring. \"Wife of my King! wife of my King!\" he\nbabbled; and then put her from him, crying, \"I have not failed you!\nPraise God, I have not failed you!\"\n\nFrom her window she saw him ride away, a rich flush of glitter and\ncolor. In new armor with a smart emblazoned surcoat the lean pedant sat\nconspicuously erect; and as he went he sang defiantly, taunting the\nweakness of his flesh.\n\nSang Osmund Heleigh:\n\n  \"Love sows, but lovers reap; and ye will see\n  The loved eyes lighten, feel the loved lips cling\n  Never again when in the grave ye be\n  Incurious of your happiness in spring,\n  And get no grace of Love, there, whither he\n  That bartered life for love no love may bring.\"\n\nSo he rode away and thus out of our history. But in the evening Gui\nCamoys came into Bristol under a flag of truce, and behind him heaved a\nlitter wherein lay Osmund Heleigh's body.\n\n\"For this man was frank and courteous,\" Camoys said to the Queen, \"and\nin the matter of the reparation he owed me acted very handsomely. It is\nfitting that he should have honorable interment.\"\n\n\"That he shall not lack,\" the Queen said, and gently unclasped from\nOsmund's wrinkled neck the thin gold chain, now locketless. \"There was a\nportrait here,\" she said; \"the portrait of a woman whom he loved in his\nyouth, Messire Camoys.

Before this\nhe had lodged for three months in the district of Ponthieu; and the\nobject of his southern journey was to assure the tenth Alphonso, then\nruling in Castile, that the latter's sister Ellinor, now resident at\nEntr\u00e9chat, was beyond any reasonable doubt the transcendent lady whose\nexistence old romancers had anticipated, however cloudily, when they\nfabled in remote time concerning Queen Heleine of Sparta.\n\nThere was a postscript to this news. The world knew that the King of\nLeon and Castile desired to be King of Germany as well, and that at\npresent a single vote in the Diet would decide between his claims and\nthose of his competitor, Earl Richard of Cornwall. De G\u00e2tinais chaffered\nfairly; he had a vote, Alphonso had a sister. So that, in effect--oh\u00e9,\nin effect, he made no question that his Majesty understood!\n\nThe Astronomer twitched his beard and demanded if the fact that Ellinor\nhad been a married woman these ten years past was not an obstacle to the\nplan which his fair cousin had proposed?\n\nHere the Prince was accoutred cap-\u00e0-pie, and hauled out a paper. Dating\nfrom Viterbo, Clement, Bishop of Rome, servant to the servants of God,\ndesirous of all health and apostolical blessing for his well-beloved son\nin Christ, stated that a compact between a boy of fifteen and a girl of\nten was an affair of no particular moment; and that in consideration of\nthe covenantors never having clapped eyes upon each other since the\nwedding-day,--even had not the precontract of marriage between the\ngroom's father and the bride's mother rendered a consummation of the\nchildish oath an obvious and a most heinous enormity,--why, that, in a\nsentence, and for all his coy verbosity, the new pontiff was perfectly\namenable to reason.\n\nSo in a month it was settled. Alphonso would give his sister to de\nG\u00e2tinais, and in exchange get the latter's vote to make Alphonso King of\nGermany; and Gui Foulques of Sabionetta--now Clement, fourth Pope to\nassume that name--would annul the previous marriage, and in exchange get\nan armament to serve him against Manfred, the late and troublesome\ntyrant of Sicily and Apulia. The scheme promised to each one of them\nthat which he in particular desired, and messengers were presently sent\ninto Ponthieu.\n\nIt is now time we put aside these Castilian matters and speak of other\nthings. In England, Prince Edward had fought, and won, a shrewd battle\nat Evesham. People said, of course, that such behavior was less in the\nmanner of his nominal father, King Henry, than reminiscent of Count\nManuel of Poictesme, whose portraits certainly the Prince resembled to\nan embarrassing extent. Either way, the barons' power was demolished,\nthere would be no more internecine war; and spurred by the unaccustomed\nidleness, Prince Edward began to think of the foreign girl he had not\nseen since the day he wedded her. She would be a woman by this, and it\nwas befitting that he claim his wife. He rode with Hawise Bulmer and her\nbaby to Ambresbury, and at the gate of the nunnery they parted, with\nwhat agonies are immaterial to this history's progression; the tale\nmerely tells that, having thus decorously rid himself of his mistress,\nthe Prince went into Lower Picardy alone, riding at adventure as he\nloved to do, and thus came to Entr\u00e9chat, where his wife resided with her\nmother, the Countess Johane.\n\nIn a wood near the castle he approached a company of Spaniards, four in\nnumber, their horses tethered while these men (Oviedans, as they told\nhim) drank about a great stone which served them for a table. Being\nthirsty, he asked and was readily accorded hospitality, and these five\nfell into amicable discourse. One fellow asked his name and business in\nthose parts, and the Prince gave each without hesitancy as he reached\nfor the bottle, and afterward dropped it just in time to catch, cannily,\nwith his naked left hand, the knife-blade with which the rascal had dug\nat the unguarded ribs. The Prince was astounded, but he was never a\nsubtle man: here were four knaves who, for reasons unexplained--but to\nthem of undoubted cogency--desired his death: manifestly there was here\nan actionable difference of opinion; so he had his sword out and killed\nthe four of them.\n\nPresently came to him an apple-cheeked boy, habited as a page, who,\nriding jauntily through the forest, lighted upon the Prince, now in\nbottomless vexation. The lad drew rein, and his lips outlined a whistle.\nAt his feet were several dead men in various conditions of\ndismemberment. And seated among them, as if throned upon this boulder,\nwas a gigantic and florid person, so tall that the heads of few men\nreached to his shoulder; a person of handsome exterior, high-featured\nand blond, having a narrow, small head, and vivid light blue eyes, and\nthe chest of a stallion; a person whose left eyebrow had an odd oblique\ndroop, so that the stupendous man appeared to be winking the information\nthat he was in jest.\n\n\"Fair friend,\" said the page. \"God give you joy! and why have you\nconverted this forest into a shambles?\"\n\nThe Prince told him as much of the half-hour's action as has been\nnarrated. \"I have perhaps been rather hasty,\" he considered, by way of\nperoration, \"and it vexes me that I did not spare, say, one of these\nlank Spaniards, if only long enough to ascertain why, in the name of\nTermagaunt, they should have desired my destruction.\"\n\nBut midway in his tale the boy had dismounted with a gasp, and he was\nnow inspecting the features of one carcass. \"Felons, my Prince! You have\nslain some eight yards of felony which might have cheated the gallows\nhad they got the Princess Ellinor safe to Burgos. Only two days ago this\nchalk-eyed fellow conveyed to her a letter.\"\n\nPrince Edward said, \"You appear, lad, to be somewhat overheels in the\nconfidence of my wife.\"\n\nNow the boy arose and defiantly flung back his head in shrill laughter.\n\"Your wife! Oh, God have mercy! Your wife, and for ten years left to her\nown devices! Why, look you, to-day you and your wife would not know each\nother were you two brought face to face.\"\n\nPrince Edward said, \"That is very near the truth.\" But, indeed, it was\nthe absolute truth, and as it concerned him was already attested.\n\n\"Sire Edward,\" the boy then said, \"your wife has wearied of this long\nwaiting till you chose to whistle for her. Last summer the young Prince\nde G\u00e2tinais came a-wooing--and he is a handsome man.\" The page made\nknown all which de G\u00e2tinais and King Alphonso planned, the words\njostling as they came in torrents, but so that one might understand. \"I\nam her page, my lord. I was to follow her. These fellows were to be my\nescort, were to ward off possible pursuit. Cry haro, beau sire! Cry\nharo, and shout it lustily, for your wife in company with six other\nknaves is at large between here and Burgos,--that unreasonable wife who\ngrew dissatisfied after a mere ten years of neglect.\"\n\n\"I have been remiss,\" the Prince said, and one huge hand strained at his\nchin; \"yes, perhaps I have been remiss. Yet it had appeared to me--But\nas it is, I bid you mount, my lad!\"\n\nThe boy demanded, \"And to what end?\"\n\n\"Oy Dieus, messire! have I not slain your escort? Why, in common reason,\nequity demands that I afford you my protection so far as Burgos,\nmessire, just as plainly as equity demands I slay de G\u00e2tinais and fetch\nback my wife to England.\"\n\nThe page wrung exquisite hands with a gesture which was but partially\ntinged with anguish, and presently began to laugh. Afterward these two\nrode southerly, in the direction of Castile.\n\nFor it appeared to the intriguing little woman a diverting jest that in\nthis fashion her husband should be the promoter of her evasion. It\nappeared to her more diverting when in two days' space she had become\nfond of him. She found him rather slow of comprehension, and she was\nhumiliated by the discovery that not an eyelash of the man was irritated\nby his wife's decampment; he considered, to all appearances, that some\nproperty of his had been stolen, and he intended, quite without passion,\nto repossess himself of it, after, of course, punishing the thief.\n\nThis troubled the Princess somewhat; and often, riding by her stolid\nhusband's side, the girl's heart raged at memory of the decade so newly\noverpast which had kept her always dependent on the charity of this or\nthat ungracious patron--on any one who would take charge of her while\nthe truant husband fought out his endless squabbles in England. Slights\nenough she had borne during the period, and squalor, and physical hunger\nalso she had known, who was the child of a king and a saint.[2] But now\nshe rode toward the dear southland; and presently she would be rid of\nthis big man, when he had served her purpose; and afterward she meant to\nwheedle Alphonso, just as she had always wheedled him, and later still,\nshe and Etienne would be very happy: in fine, to-morrow was to be a new\nday.\n\nSo these two rode southward, and always Prince Edward found this new\npage of his--this Miguel de Rueda,--a jolly lad, who whistled and sang\ninapposite snatches of balladry, without any formal ending or beginning,\ndescanting always with the delicate irrelevancy of a bird-trill.\n\nSang Miguel de Rueda:\n\n  \"Man's Love, that leads me day by day\n  Through many a screened and scented way,\n  Finds to assuage my thirst.\n\n  \"No love that may the old love slay,\n  None sweeter than the first.\n\n  \"Fond heart of mine, that beats so fast\n  As this or that fair maid trips past,\n  Once, and with lesser stir\n  We viewed the grace of love, at last,\n  And turned idolater.\n\n  \"Lad's Love it was, that in the spring\n  When all things woke to blossoming\n  Was as a child that came\n  Laughing, and filled with wondering,\n  Nor knowing his own name--\"\n\n\"And still I would prefer to think,\" the big man interrupted, heavily,\n\"that Sicily is not the only allure. I would prefer to think my wife so\nbeautiful.--And yet, as I remember her, she was nothing extraordinary.\"\n\nThe page a little tartly said that people might forget a deal within a\ndecade.\n\nThe Prince continued his unriddling of the scheme hatched in Castile.\n\"When Manfred is driven out of Sicily they will give the throne to de\nG\u00e2tinais. He intends to get both a kingdom and a handsome wife by this\nneat affair. And in reason, England must support my Uncle Richard's\nclaim to the German crown, against El Sabio--Why, my lad, I ride\nsouthward to prevent a war that would devastate half Europe.\"\n\n\"You ride southward in the attempt to rob a miserable woman of her sole\nchance of happiness,\" Miguel de Rueda estimated.\n\n\"That is undeniable, if she loves this thrifty Prince, as indeed I do\nnot question my wife does. Yet our happiness here is a trivial matter,\nwhereas war is a great disaster. You have not seen--as I, my little\nMiguel, have often seen--a man viewing his death-wound with a face of\nstupid wonder, a bewildered wretch in point to die in his lord's quarrel\nand understanding never a word of it. Or a woman, say--a woman's twisted\nand naked body, the breasts yet horribly heaving, in the red ashes of\nsome village, or the already dripping hoofs which will presently crush\nthis body. Well, it is to prevent many such ugly spectacles hereabout\nthat I ride southward.\"\n\nMiguel de Rueda shuddered. But, \"She has her right to happiness,\" the\npage stubbornly said.\n\n\"She has only one right,\" the Prince retorted; \"because it has pleased\nthe Emperor of Heaven to appoint us twain to lofty stations, to entrust\nto us the five talents of the parable; whence is our debt to Him, being\nfivefold, so much the greater than that of common persons. Therefore\nthe more is it our sole right, being fivefold, to serve God without\nfaltering, and therefore is our happiness, or our unhappiness, the more\nan inconsiderable matter. For, as I have read in the Annals of the\nRomans--\" He launched upon the story of King Pompey and his daughter,\nwhom a certain duke regarded with impure and improper emotions. \"My\nlittle Miguel, that ancient king is our Heavenly Father, that only\ndaughter is the rational soul of us, which is here delivered for\nprotection to five soldiers--that is, to the five senses,--to preserve\nit from the devil, the world, and the flesh. But, alas! the\ntoo-credulous soul, desirous of gazing upon the gaudy vapors of this\nworld--\"\n\n\"You whine like a canting friar,\" the page complained; \"and I can assure\nyou that the Lady Ellinor was prompted rather than hindered by her\nGod-given faculties of sight and hearing and so on when she fell in love\nwith de G\u00e2tinais. Of you two, he is, beyond any question, the handsomer\nand the more intelligent man, and it was God who bestowed on her\nsufficient wit to perceive the superiority of de G\u00e2tinais. And what am I\nto deduce from this?\"\n\nThe Prince reflected. At last he said: \"I have also read in these same\nGestes how Seneca mentions that in poisoned bodies, on account of the\nmalignancy and the coldness of the poison, no worm will engender; but if\nthe body be smitten by lightning, in a few days the carcass will abound\nwith vermin. My little Miguel, both men and women are at birth\nempoisoned by sin, and then they produce no worm--that is, no virtue.\nBut once they are struck with lightning--that is, by the grace of\nGod,--they are astonishingly fruitful in good works.\"\n\nThe page began to laugh. \"You are hopelessly absurd, my Prince, though\nyou will never know it,--and I hate you a little,--and I envy you a\ngreat deal.\"\n\n\"Ah, but,\" Prince Edward said, in misapprehension, for the man was never\nquick-witted,--\"but it is not for my own happiness that I ride\nsouthward.\"\n\nThe page then said, \"What is her name?\"\n\nPrince Edward answered, very fondly, \"Hawise.\"\n\n\"I hate her, too,\" said Miguel de Rueda; \"and I think that the holy\nangels alone know how profoundly I envy her.\"\n\nIn the afternoon of the same day they neared Ruffec, and at the ford\nfound three brigands ready, two of whom the Prince slew, and the other\nfled.\n\nNext night they supped at Manneville, and sat afterward in the little\nsquare, tree-chequered, that lay before their inn. Miguel had procured a\nlute from the innkeeper, and he strummed idly as these two debated\ntogether of great matters; about them was an immeasurable twilight,\nmoonless, but tempered by many stars, and everywhere they could hear an\nagreeable whispering of leaves.\n\n\"Listen, my Prince,\" the boy said: \"here is one view of the affair.\"\nAnd he began to chant, without rhyming, without raising his voice above\nthe pitch of talk, while the lute monotonously accompanied his chanting.\n\nSang Miguel:\n\n  \"Passeth a little while, and Irus the beggar and\n  Menephtah the high king are at sorry unison, and\n  Guenevere is a skull. Multitudinously we tread\n  toward oblivion, as ants hasten toward sugar, and\n  presently Time cometh with his broom. Multitudinously\n  we tread a dusty road toward oblivion; but\n  yonder the sun shines upon a grass-plot, converting it\n  into an emerald; and I am aweary of the trodden path.\n\n  \"Vine-crowned is the fair peril that guards the\n  grasses yonder, and her breasts are naked. 'Vanity\n  of Vanities!' saith the beloved. But she whom I love\n  seems very far away to-night, though I might be with\n  her if I would. And she may not aid me now, for not\n  even love is all-powerful. She is most dear of created\n  women, and very wise, but she may never understand\n  that at any time one grows aweary of the trodden path.\n\n  \"At sight of my beloved, love closes over my heart\n  like a flood. For the sake of my beloved I have striven,\n  with a good endeavor, to my tiny uttermost. Pardie, I\n  am not Priam at the head of his army! A little while\n  and I will repent; to-night I cannot but remember that\n  there are women whose lips are of a livelier tint, that\n  life is short at best, that wine evokes in me some admiration\n  for myself, and that I am aweary of the trodden\n  path.\n\n  \"She is very far from me to-night. Yonder in the\n  H\u00f6rselberg they exult and make sweet songs, songs\n  which are sweeter, immeasurably sweeter, than this\n  song of mine, but in the trodden path I falter, for I am\n  tired, tired in every fibre of me, and I am aweary of\n  the trodden path\"\n\nFollowed a silence. \"Ignorance spoke there,\" the Prince said. \"It is the\nsong of a woman, or else of a boy who is very young. Give me the lute,\nmy little Miguel.\" And presently the Prince, too, sang.\n\nSang the Prince:\n\n  \"I was in a path, and I trod toward the citadel of the\n  land's Seigneur, and on either side were pleasant and\n  forbidden meadows, having various names. And one\n  trod with me who babbled of the brooding mountains\n  and of the low-lying and adjacent clouds; of the west\n  wind and of the budding fruit-trees. He debated the\n  significance of these things, and he went astray to\n  gather violets, while I walked in the trodden path.\"\n\n  \"He babbled of genial wine and of the alert lips of\n  women, of swinging censers and of the serene countenances\n  of priests, and of the clear, lovely colors of\n  bread and butter, and his heart was troubled by a\n  world profuse in beauty. And he leaped a stile to share\n  his allotted provision with a dying dog, and afterward,\n  being hungry, a wall to pilfer apples, while I walked\n  in the trodden path.\n\n  \"He babbled of Autumn's bankruptcy and of the age-long\n  lying promises of Spring; and of his own desire\n  to be at rest; and of running waters and of decaying\n  leaves. He babbled of the far-off stars; and he debated\n  whether they were the eyes of God or gases which\n  burned, and he demonstrated, with logic, that neither\n  existed. At times he stumbled as he stared about him\n  and munched his apples, so that he was all bemired, but\n  I walked in the trodden path.\n\n  \"And the path led to the gateway of a citadel, and\n  through the gateway. 'Let us not enter,' he said, 'for\n  the citadel is vacant, and, moreover, I am in profound\n  terror, and, besides, I have not as yet eaten all my\n  apples.' And he wept aloud, but I was not afraid, for\n  I had walked in the trodden path.\"\n\nAgain there was a silence. \"You paint a dreary world, my Prince.\"\n\n\"My little Miguel, I paint the world as the Eternal Father made it. The\nlaws of the place are written large, so that all may read them; and we\nknow that every road, whether it be my trodden path or some byway through\nyour gayer meadows, yet leads in the end to God. We have our choice,--or\nto come to Him as a laborer comes at evening for the day's wages fairly\nearned, or to come as a roisterer haled before the magistrate.\"\n\n\"I consider you to be in the right,\" the boy said, after a lengthy\ninterval, \"although I decline--and decline emphatically--to believe you.\"\n\nThe Prince laughed. \"There spoke Youth,\" he said, and he sighed as\nthough he were a patriarch. \"But we have sung, we two, the Eternal\nTenson of God's will and of man's desires. And I claim the prize, my\nLittle Miguel.\"\n\nSuddenly the page kissed one huge hand. \"You have conquered, my very\ndull and very glorious Prince. Concerning that Hawise--\" But Miguel de\nRueda choked. \"Oh, I do not understand! and yet in part I understand!\"\nthe boy wailed in the darkness.\n\nAnd the Prince laid one hand upon his page's hair, and smiled in the\ndarkness to note how soft was this hair, since the man was less a fool\nthan at first view you might have taken him to be; and he said:\n\n\"One must play the game out fairly, my lad. We are no little people,\nshe and I, the children of many kings, of God's regents here on earth;\nand it was never reasonable, my Miguel, that gentlefolk should cheat at\ntheir dicing.\"\n\nThe same night Miguel de Rueda repeated the prayer which Saint Theophilus\nmade long ago to the Mother of God:\n\n    \"Dame, je n'ose,\n  Flors d'aiglentier et lis et rose,\n  En qui li filz Diex se repose,\"\n\nand so on. Or, in other wording: \"Hearken, O gracious Lady! thou that\nart more fair than any flower of the eglantine, more comely than the\nblossoming of the rose or of the lily! thou to whom was confided the\nvery Son of God! Harken, for I am afraid! afford counsel to me that am\nensnared by Satan and know not what to do! Never will I make an end of\npraying. O Virgin d\u00e9bonnaire! O honored Lady! Thou that wast once a\nwoman--!\"\n\nSo he prayed, and upon the next day as these two rode southward, he sang\nhalf as if in defiance.\n\nSang Miguel:\n\n    \"And still,--whatever years impend\n  To witness Time a fickle friend,\n  And Youth a dwindling fire,--\n  I must adore till all years end\n  My first love, Heart's Desire.\n\n    \"I may not hear men speak of her\n  Unmoved, and vagrant pulses stir\n  To greet her passing-by,\n  And I, in all her worshipper\n  Must serve her till I die.\n\n    \"For I remember: this is she\n  That reigns in one man's memory\n  Immune to age and fret,\n  And stays the maid I may not see\n  Nor win to, nor forget.\"\n\nIt was on the following day, near Bazas, that these two encountered Adam\nde Gourdon, a Proven\u00e7al knight, with whom the Prince fought for a long\nwhile, without either contestant giving way; in consequence a rendezvous\nwas fixed for the November of that year, and afterward the Prince and de\nGourdon parted, highly pleased with each other.\n\nThus the Prince and his attendant came, in late September, to Maul\u00e9on,\non the Castilian frontier, and dined there at the _Fir Cone._ Three or\nfour lackeys were about--some exalted person's retinue? Prince Edward\nhazarded to the swart little landlord, as the Prince and Miguel lingered\nover the remnants of their meal.\n\nYes, the fellow informed them: the Prince de G\u00e2tinais had lodged there\nfor a whole week, watching the north road, as circumspect of all passage\nas a cat over a mouse-hole. Eh, monseigneur expected some one,\ndoubtless--a lady, it might be,--the gentlefolk had their escapades like\nevery one else. The innkeeper babbled vaguely, for on a sudden he was\nvery much afraid of his gigantic patron.\n\n\"You will show me to his room,\" Prince Edward said, with a politeness\nthat was ingratiating.\n\nThe host shuddered and obeyed.\n\nMiguel de Rueda, left alone, sat quite silent, his finger-tips drumming\nupon the table. He rose suddenly and flung back his shoulders, all\nresolution. On the stairway he passed the black little landlord, who was\nnow in a sad twitter, foreseeing bloodshed. But Miguel de Rueda went on\nto the room above. The door was ajar. He paused there.\n\nDe G\u00e2tinais had risen from his dinner and stood facing the door. He,\ntoo, was a blond man and the comeliest of his day. And at sight of him\nawoke in the woman's heart all the old tenderness; handsome and brave\nand witty she knew him to be, as indeed the whole world knew him to be\ndistinguished by every namable grace; and the innate weakness of de\nG\u00e2tinais, which she alone suspected, made him now seem doubly dear.\nFiercely she wanted to shield him, less from bodily hurt than from that\nself-degradation which she cloudily apprehended to be at hand; the test\nwas come, and Etienne would fail. Thus much she knew with a sick,\nillimitable surety, and she loved de G\u00e2tinais with a passion which\ndwarfed comprehension.\n\n\"O Madame the Virgin!\" prayed Miguel de Rueda, \"thou that wast once a\nwoman, even as I am now a woman! grant that the man may slay him\nquickly! grant that he may slay Etienne very quickly, honored Lady, so\nthat my Etienne may die unshamed!\"\n\n\"I must question, messire,\" de G\u00e2tinais was saying, \"whether you have\nbeen well inspired. Yes, quite frankly, I do await the arrival of her\nwho is your nominal wife; and your intervention at this late stage, I\ntake it, can have no outcome save to render you absurd. So, come now!\nbe advised by me, messire--\"\n\nPrince Edward said, \"I am not here to talk.\"\n\n\"--For, messire, I grant you that in ordinary disputation the cutting of\none gentleman's throat by another gentleman is well enough, since the\nargument is unanswerable. Yet in this case we have each of us too much\nto live for; you to govern your reconquered England, and I--you perceive\nthat I am candid--to achieve in turn the kingship of another realm. Now\nto secure this realm, possession of the Lady Ellinor is to me essential;\nto you she is nothing.\"\n\n\"She is a woman whom I have deeply wronged,\" Prince Edward said, \"and to\nwhom, God willing, I mean to make atonement. Ten years ago they wedded\nus, willy-nilly, to avert the impending war between Spain and England;\nto-day El Sabio intends to purchase Germany with her body as the price;\nyou to get Sicily as her husband. Mort de Dieu! is a woman thus to be\nbought and sold like hog's flesh! We have other and cleaner customs, we\nof England.\"\n\n\"Eh, and who purchased the woman first?\" de G\u00e2tinais spat at him,\nviciously, for the Frenchman now saw his air-castle shaken to the\ncorner-stone.\n\n\"They wedded me to the child in order that a great war might be averted.\nI acquiesced, since it appeared preferable that two people suffer\ninconvenience rather than many thousands be slain. And still this is my\nview of the matter. Yet afterward I failed her. Love had no clause in\nour agreement; but I owed her more protection than I have afforded.\nEngland has long been no place for women. I thought she would comprehend\nthat much. But I know very little of women. Battle and death are more\nwholesome companions, I now perceive, than such folk as you and\nAlphonso. Woman is the weaker vessel--the negligence was mine--I may not\nblame her.\" The big and simple man was in an agony of repentance.\n\nOn a sudden he strode forward, his sword now shifted to his left hand\nand his right hand outstretched. \"One and all, we are weaklings in the\nnet of circumstance. Shall one herring, then, blame his fellow if his\nfellow jostle him? We walk as in a mist of error, and Belial is fertile\nin allurements; yet always it is granted us to behold that sin is sin. I\nhave perhaps sinned through anger, Messire de G\u00e2tinais, more deeply than\nyou have planned to sin through luxury and through ambition. Let us then\ncry quits, Messire de G\u00e2tinais, and afterward part in peace, and in\ncommon repentance.\"\n\n\"And yield you Ellinor?\" de G\u00e2tinais said. \"Oh no, messire, I reply to\nyou with Arnaud de Marveil, that marvellous singer of eld, 'They may\nbear her from my presence, but they can never untie the knot which\nunites my heart to her; for that heart, so tender and so constant, God\nalone divides with my lady, and the portion which God possesses He holds\nbut as a part of her domain, and as her vassal.'\" \"This is blasphemy,\"\nPrince Edward now retorted, \"and for such observations alone you merit\ndeath. Will you always talk and talk and talk? I perceive that the devil\nis far more subtle than you, messire, and leads you, like a pig with a\nring in his nose, toward gross iniquity. Messire, I tell you that for\nyour soul's health I doubly mean to kill you now. So let us make an end\nof this.\"\n\nDe G\u00e2tinais turned and took up his sword. \"Since you will have it,\" he\nrather regretfully said; \"yet I reiterate that you play an absurd part.\nYour wife has deserted you, has fled in abhorrence of you. For three\nweeks she has been tramping God knows whither or in what company--\"\n\nHe was here interrupted. \"What the Lady Ellinor has done,\" Prince Edward\ncrisply said, \"was at my request. We were wedded at Burgos; it was\nnatural that we should desire our reunion to take place at Burgos; and\nshe came to Burgos with an escort which I provided.\"\n\nDe G\u00e2tinais sneered. \"So that is the tale you will deliver to the\nworld?\"\n\n\"After I have slain you,\" the Prince said, \"yes.\"\n\n\"The reservation is wise. For if I were dead, Messire Edward, there\nwould be none to know that you risk all for a drained goblet, for an\norange already squeezed--quite dry, messire.\"\n\n\"Face of God!\" the Prince said.\n\nBut de G\u00e2tinais flung back both arms in a great gesture, so that he\nknocked a flask of claret from the table at his rear. \"I am candid, my\nPrince. I would not see any brave gentleman slain in a cause so foolish.\nIn consequence I kiss and tell. In effect, I was eloquent, I was\nmagnificent, so that in the end her reserve was shattered like the\nwooden flask yonder at our feet. Is it worth while, think you, that our\nblood flow like this flagon's contents?\"\n\n\"Liar!\" Prince Edward said, very softly. \"O hideous liar! Already your\neyes shift!\" He drew near and struck the Frenchman. \"Talk and talk and\ntalk! and lying talk! I am ashamed while I share the world with a thing\nas base as you.\"\n\nDe G\u00e2tinais hurled upon him, cursing, sobbing in an abandoned fury. In\nan instant the place resounded like a smithy, for there were no better\nswordsmen living than these two. The eavesdropper could see nothing\nclearly. Round and round they veered in a whirl of turmoil. Presently\nPrince Edward trod upon the broken flask, smashing it. His foot slipped\nin the spilth of wine, and the huge body went down like an oak, his head\nstriking one leg of the table.\n\n\"A candle!\" de G\u00e2tinais cried, and he panted now--\"a hundred candles to\nthe Virgin of Beaujolais!\" He shortened his sword to stab the Prince of\nEngland.\n\nThe eavesdropper came through the doorway, and flung herself between\nPrince Edward and the descending sword. The sword dug deep into her\nshoulder, so that she shrieked once with the cold pain of this wound.\nThen she rose, ashen. \"Liar!\" she said. \"Oh, I am shamed while I share\nthe world with a thing as base as you!\"\n\nIn silence de G\u00e2tinais regarded her. There was a long interval before he\nsaid, \"Ellinor!\" and then again, \"Ellinor!\" like a man bewildered.\n\n\"_I was eloquent, I was magnificent_\" she said, \"_so that in the end her\nreserve was shattered!_ Certainly, messire, it is not your death which I\ndesire, since a man dies so very, very quickly. I desire for you--I know\nnot what I desire for you!\" the girl wailed.\n\n\"You desire that I should endure this present moment,\" de G\u00e2tinais\nreplied; \"for as God reigns, I love you, of whom I have spoken infamy,\nand my shame is very bitter.\"\n\nShe said: \"And I, too, loved you. It is strange to think of that.\"\n\n\"I was afraid. Never in my life have I been afraid before to-day. But I\nwas afraid of this terrible and fair and righteous man. I saw all hope\nof you vanish, all hope of Sicily--in effect, I lied as a cornered beast\nspits out his venom.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she answered. \"Give me water, Etienne.\" She washed and bound\nthe Prince's head with a vinegar-soaked napkin. Ellinor sat upon the\nfloor, the big man's head upon her knee. \"He will not die of this, for\nhe is of strong person. Look you, Messire de G\u00e2tinais, you and I are not\nstrong. We are so fashioned that we can enjoy only the pleasant things\nof life. But this man can enjoy--enjoy, mark you--the commission of any\nact, however distasteful, if he think it to be his duty. There is the\ndifference. I cannot fathom him. But it is now necessary that I become\nall which he loves--since he loves it,--and that I be in thought and\ndeed all which he desires. For I have heard the Tenson through.\"\n\n\"You love him!\" said de G\u00e2tinais.\n\nShe glanced upward with a pitiable smile. \"No, it is you whom I love, my\nEtienne. You cannot understand how at this very moment every fibre of\nme--heart, soul, and body--may be longing just to comfort you, and to\ngive you all which you desire, my Etienne, and to make you happy, my\nhandsome Etienne, at however dear a cost. No; you will never understand\nthat. And since you may not understand, I merely bid you go and leave me\nwith my husband.\"\n\nAnd then there fell between these two an infinite silence.\n\n\"Listen,\" de G\u00e2tinais said; \"grant me some little credit for what I do.\nYou are alone; the man is powerless. My fellows are within call. A word\nsecures the Prince's death; a word gets me you and Sicily. And I do not\nspeak that word, for you are my lady as well as his, and your will is my\none law.\"\n\nBut there was no mercy in the girl, no more for him than for herself.\nThe big head lay upon her breast; she caressed the gross hair of it ever\nso lightly. \"These are tinsel oaths,\" she crooned, as if rapt with\nincurious content; \"these are the old empty protestations of all you\nstrutting poets. A word gets you what you desire! Then why do you not\nspeak that word? Why do you not speak many words, and become again as\neloquent and as magnificent as you were when you contrived that adultery\nabout which you were just now telling my husband?\"\n\nDe G\u00e2tinais raised clenched hands. \"I am shamed,\" he said; and then he\nsaid, \"It is just.\"\n\nHe left the room and presently rode away with his men. I say that, here\nat last, he had done a knightly deed, but she thought little of it,\nnever raised her head as the troop clattered from Maul\u00e9on, with a\nlessening beat which lapsed now into the blunders of an aging fly who\ndoddered about the window yonder.\n\nShe stayed thus, motionless, her meditations adrift in the future; and\nthat which she foreread left her not all sorry nor profoundly glad, for\nliving seemed by this, though scarcely the merry and colorful business\nwhich she had esteemed it, yet immeasurably the more worth while.\n\nTHE END OF THE SECOND NOVEL\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE STORY OF THE RAT-TRAP\n\n\n  \"Leixant a part le stil dels trobados,\n  Dos grans dezigs ban combatut ma pensa,\n  Mas lo voler vers un seguir dispensa:\n  Yo l'vos publich, amar dretament vos.\"\n\nTHE THIRD NOVEL.--MEREGRETT OF FRANCE, THINKING TO PRESERVE A HOODWINKED\nGENTLEMAN, ANNOYS A SPIDER; AND BY THE GRACE OF DESTINY THE WEB OF THAT\nCUNNING INSECT ENTRAPS A BUTTERFLY, A WASP, AND THEN A GOD; WHO SHATTERS\nIT.\n\n\n\n\n_The Story of the Rat-Trap_\n\n\nIn the year of grace 1298, a little before Candlemas (thus Nicolas\nbegins), came letters to the first King Edward of England from his\nkinsman and ambassador to France, Earl Edmund of Lancaster. It was\nperfectly apparent, the Earl wrote, that the French King meant to\nsurrender to the Earl's lord and brother neither the duchy of Guienne\nnor the Lady Blanch. This lady, I must tell you, was now affianced to\nKing Edward, whose first wife, Dame Ellinor, had died eight years before\nthis time.\n\nThe courier found Sire Edward at Ipswich, midway in celebration of his\ndaughter's marriage to the Count of Holland. The King read the letters\nthrough and began to laugh; and presently broke into a rage such as was\npossible (men whispered) only to the demon-tainted blood of Oriander's\ndescendants. Next day the keeper of the privy purse entered upon the\nhouse-hold-books a considerable sum \"to make good a large ruby and an\nemerald lost out of his coronet when the King's Grace was pleased to\nthrow it into the fire\"; and upon the same day the King recalled\nLancaster. The King then despatched yet another embassy into France to\ntreat about Sire Edward's marriage. This last embassy was headed by the\nEarl of Aquitaine: his lieutenant was Lord Pevensey, the King's natural\nson by Hawise Bulmer.\n\nThe Earl got audience of the French King at Mezelais. Walking alone came\nthis Earl of Aquitaine, with a large retinue, into the hall where the\nbarons of France stood according to their rank; in unadorned russet were\nthe big Earl and his attendants, but upon the scarlets and purples of\nthe French lords many jewels shone: it was as though through a corridor\nof gayly painted sunlit glass that the grave Earl came to the dais where\nsat King Philippe.\n\nThe King had risen at close sight of the new envoy, and had gulped once\nor twice, and without speaking, had hurriedly waved his lords out of\near-shot. The King's perturbation was very extraordinary.\n\n\"Fair cousin,\" the Earl now said, without any prelude, \"four years ago I\nwas affianced to your sister, Dame Blanch. You stipulated that Gascony\nbe given up to you in guaranty, as a settlement on any children I might\nhave by that incomparable lady. I assented, and yielded you the\nprovince, upon the understanding, sworn to according to the faith of\nloyal kings, that within forty days you assign to me its seignory as\nyour vassal. And I have had of you since then neither my province nor\nmy betrothed wife, but only excuses, Sire Philippe.\"\n\nWith eloquence the Frenchman touched upon the emergencies to which the\npublic weal so often drives men of high station, and upon his private\ngrief over the necessity--unavoidable, alas!--of returning a hard answer\nbefore the council; and became so voluble that Sire Edward merely\nlaughed in that big-lunged and disconcerting way of his, and afterward\nlodged for a week at Mezelais, nominally passing by his minor title of\nEarl of Aquitaine, and as his own ambassador.\n\nNegotiations became more swift of foot, since a man serves himself with\nzeal. In addition, the French lords could make nothing of a politician\nso thick-witted that he replied to every consideration of expediency\nwith a parrot-like reiteration of the circumstance that already the\nbargain was signed and sworn to: in consequence, while daily they fumed\nover his stupidity, daily he gained his point. During this period he\nwas, upon one pretext or another, very often in the company of his\naffianced wife, Dame Blanch.\n\nThis lady, I must tell you, was the handsomest of her day; there could\nnowhere be found a creature more agreeable to every sense; and she\ncompelled the adoring regard of men, it is recorded, not gently but in\nan imperious fashion. Sire Edward, who, till this, had loved her merely\nby report, and, in accordance with the high custom of old, through many\nperusals of her portrait, now appeared besotted. He was an aging man,\nnear sixty, huge and fair, with a crisp beard, and the bright unequal\neyes of Manuel of Poictesme. The better-read at Mezelais began to liken\nthis so candidly enamored monarch and his Princess to Sieur Hercules at\nthe feet of Queen Omphale.\n\nThe court hunted and slew a stag of ten in the woods of Ermenoue\u00efl,\nwhich stand thick about the ch\u00e2teau; and at the hunt's end, these two\nhad dined at Rigon the forester's hut, in company with Dame Meregrett,\nthe French King's younger sister. She sat a little apart from the\nbetrothed, and stared through the hut's one window. We know, nowadays,\nit was not merely the trees she was considering.\n\nDame Blanch seemed undisposed to mirth. \"We have slain the stag, beau\nsire,\" she said, \"and have made of his death a brave diversion. To-day\nwe have had our sport of death,--and presently the gay years wind past\nus, as our cavalcade came toward the stag, and God's incurious angel\nslays us, much as we slew the stag. And we shall not understand, and we\nshall wonder, as the stag did, in helpless wonder. And Death will have\nhis sport of us, as if in atonement.\" Her big eyes shone, as when the\nsun glints upon a sand-bottomed pool. \"Oh\u00e9, I have known such happiness\nof late, beau sire, that I am hideously afraid to die.\"\n\nThe King answered, \"I too have been very happy of late.\"\n\n\"But it is profitless to talk about death thus drearily. Let us flout\nhim, instead, with some gay song.\" And thereupon she handed Sire Edward\na lute.\n\nThe King accepted it. \"Death is not reasonably mocked by any person,\"\nSire Edward said, \"since in the end he conquers, and of the lips that\ngibed at him remains but a little dust. Rather should I, who already\nstand beneath a lifted sword, make for my destined and inescapable\nconqueror a Sirvente, which is the Song of Service.\"\n\nSang Sire Edward:[3]\n\n  \"I sing of Death, that comes unto the king,\n  And lightly plucks him from the cushioned throne;\n  And drowns his glory and his warfaring\n  In unrecorded dim oblivion;\n  And girds another with the sword thereof;\n  And sets another in his stead to reign;\n  And ousts the remnant, nakedly to gain\n  Styx' formless shore and nakedly complain\n  Midst twittering ghosts lamenting life and love.\n\n   \"For Death is merciless: a crack-brained king\n  He raises in the place of Prester John,\n  Smites Priam, and mid-course in conquering\n  Bids Caesar pause; the wit of Salomon,\n  The wealth of Nero and the pride thereof,\n  And battle-prowess--or of Tamburlaine\n  Darius, Jeshua, or Charlemaigne,--\n  Wheedle and bribe and surfeit Death in vain,\n  And get no grace of him nor any love.\n\n  \"Incuriously he smites the armored king\n  And tricks his counsellors--\"\n\n\"True, O God!\" murmured the tiny woman, who sat beside the window\nyonder. With that, Dame Meregrett rose, and passed from the room.\n\nThe two lovers started, and laughed, and afterward paid little heed to\nher outgoing. Sire Edward had put aside the lute and sat now regarding\nthe Princess. His big left hand propped the bearded chin; his grave\ncountenance was flushed, and his intent eyes shone under their shaggy\nbrows, very steadily, although the left eye was now so nearly shut as to\nreveal the merest spark.\n\nIrresolutely, Dame Blanch plucked at her gown; then rearranged a fold of\nit, and with composure awaited the ensuing action, afraid at bottom, but\nnot at all ill-pleased; and she looked downward.\n\nThe King said: \"Never before were we two alone, madame. Fate is very\ngracious to me this morning.\"\n\n\"Fate,\" the lady considered, \"has never denied much to the Hammer of the\nScots.\"\n\n\"She has denied me nothing,\" he sadly said, \"save the one thing that\nmakes this business of living seem a rational proceeding. Fame and power\nand wealth fate has accorded me, no doubt, but never the common joys of\nlife. And, look you, my Princess, I am of aging person now. During some\nthirty years I have ruled England according to my interpretation of\nGod's will as it was anciently made manifest by the holy Evangelists;\nand during that period I have ruled England not without odd by-ends of\ncommendation: yet behold, to-day I forget the world-applauded, excellent\nKing Edward, and remember only Edward Plantagenet--hot-blooded and\ndesirous man!--of whom that much-commended king has made a prisoner all\nthese years.\"\n\n\"It is the duty of exalted persons,\" Blanch unsteadily said, \"to put\naside such private inclinations as their breasts may harbor--\"\n\nHe said, \"I have done what I might for the happiness of every Englishman\nwithin my realm saving only Edward Plantagenet; and now I think his turn\nto be at hand.\" Then the man kept silence; and his hot appraisal daunted\nher.\n\n\"Lord,\" she presently faltered, \"lord, you know that we are already\nbetrothed, and, in sober verity, Love cannot extend his laws between\nhusband and wife, since the gifts of love are voluntary, and husband and\nwife are but the slaves of duty--\"\n\n\"Troubadourish nonsense!\" Sire Edward said; \"yet it is true that the\ngifts of love are voluntary. And therefore--Ha, most beautiful, what\nhave you and I to do with all this chaffering over Guienne?\" The two\nstood very close to each other now. Blanch said, \"It is a high\nmatter--\" Then on a sudden the full-veined girl was aglow. \"It is a\ntrivial matter.\" He took her in his arms, since already her cheeks\nflared in scarlet anticipation of the event.\n\nThus holding her, he wooed the girl tempestuously. Here, indeed, was\nSieur Hercules enslaved, burned by a fiercer fire than that of Nessus,\nand the huge bulk of the unconquerable visibly shaken by his adoration.\nIn a disordered tapestry of verbiage, aflap in winds of passion, she\npresently beheld herself prefigured by Balkis, the Judean's lure, and by\nthat Princess of Cyprus who reigned in Aristotle's time, and by\nNicolete, the King's daughter of Carthage,--since the first flush of\nmorning was as a rush-light before her resplendency, the man swore; and\nin conclusion, he likened her to a modern Countess of Tripolis, for love\nof whom he, like Rudel, had cleft the seas, and losing whom he must\ninevitably die as did Rudel. Sire Edward snapped his fingers now over\nany consideration of Guienne. He would conquer for her all Muscovy and\nall Cataia, too, if she desired mere acreage. Meanwhile he wanted her,\nand his hard and savage passion beat down opposition as if with a\nbludgeon.\n\n\"Heart's emperor,\" the trembling girl replied, \"I think that you were\ncast in some larger mould than we of France. Oh, none of us may dare\nresist you! and I know that nothing matters, nothing in all the world,\nsave that you love me. Then take me, since you will it,--and take me\nnot as King, since you will otherwise, but as Edward Plantagenet. For\nlisten! by good luck you have this afternoon despatched Rigon for\nChevrieul, where to-morrow we were to hunt the great boar. So to-night\nthis hut will be unoccupied.\"\n\nThe man was silent. He had a gift that way when occasion served.\n\n\"Here, then, beau sire! here, then, at nine, you are to meet me with my\nchaplain. Behold, he marries us, as glibly as though we two were\npeasants. Poor king and princess!\" cried Dame Blanch, and in a voice\nwhich thrilled him, \"shall ye not, then, dare to be but man and woman?\"\n\n\"Ha!\" the King said. \"So the chaplain makes a third! Well, the King is\npleased to loose his prisoner, that long-imprisoned Edward Plantagenet:\nand I will do it.\"\n\nSo he came that night, without any retinue, and habited as a forester,\nwith a horn swung about his neck, into the unlighted hut of Rigon the\nforester, and he found a woman there, though not the woman whom he had\nexpected.\n\n\"Treachery, beau sire! Horrible treachery!\" she wailed.\n\n\"I have encountered it before this,\" the big man said.\n\n\"Presently will come to you not Blanch but Philippe, with many men to\nback him. And presently they will slay you. You have been trapped, beau\nsire. Ah, for the love of God, go! Go, while there is yet time!\" Sire\nEdward reflected. Undoubtedly, to light on Edward Longshanks alone in a\nforest would appear to King Philippe, if properly attended, a tempting\nchance to settle divers difficulties, once for all; and Sire Edward knew\nthe conscience of his old opponent to be invulnerable. The act would\nviolate the core of hospitality and knighthood, no doubt, but its\noutcome would be a very definite gain to France, and for the rest,\nmerely a dead body in a ditch. Not a monarch in Christendom, Sire Edward\nreflected, but feared and in consequence hated the Hammer of the Scots,\nand in further consequence would not lift a finger to avenge him; and\nnot a being in the universe would rejoice more heartily at the success\nof Philippe's treachery than would Sire Edward's son and immediate\nsuccessor, the young Prince Edward of Caernarvon. Taking matters by and\nlarge, Philippe had all the powers of common-sense to back him in\ncontriving an assassination.\n\nWhat Sire Edward said was, \"Dame Blanch, then, knew of this?\" But\nMeregrett's pitiful eyes had already answered him, and he laughed a\nlittle.\n\n\"In that event, I have to-night enregistered my name among the goodly\ncompany of Love's Lunatics,--as yokefellow with Dan Merlin in his\nthornbush, and with wise Salomon when he capered upon the high places of\nChemosh, and with Duke Ares sheepishly agrin in the net of Mulciber.\nRogues all, madame! fools all! yet always the flesh trammels us, and\nallures the soul to such sensual delights as bar its passage toward the\neternal life wherein alone lies the empire and the heritage of the soul.\nAnd why does this carnal prison so impede the soul? Because Satan once\nranked among the sons of God, and the Eternal Father, as I take it, has\nnot yet forgotten the antique relationship,--and hence it is permitted\neven in our late time that always the flesh rebel against the spirit,\nand that always these so tiny and so thin-voiced tricksters, these\nhighly tinted miracles of iniquity, so gracious in demeanor and so\nstarry-eyed--\"\n\nThen he turned and pointed, no longer the orotund zealot but the\nexpectant captain now. \"Look, my Princess!\" In the pathway from which he\nhad recently emerged stood a man in full armor like a sentinel. \"Mort de\nDieu, we can but try to get out of this,\" Sire Edward said.\n\n\"You should have tried without talking so much,\" replied Meregrett. She\nfollowed him. And presently, in a big splash of moonlight, the armed\nman's falchion glittered across their way. \"Back,\" he bade them, \"for by\nthe King's orders, I can let no man pass.\"\n\n\"It would be very easy now to strangle this herring,\" Sire Edward\nreflected.\n\n\"But it is not easy to strangle a whole school of herring,\" the fellow\nretorted. \"Hoh, Messire d'Aquitaine, the bushes of Ermenoue\u00eel are alive\nwith my associates. The hut yonder, in effect, is girdled by them,--and\nwe have our orders to let no man pass.\"\n\n\"Have you any orders concerning women?\" the King said.\n\nThe man deliberated. Sire Edward handed him three gold pieces. \"There\nwas assuredly no specific mention of petticoats,\" the soldier now\nrecollected, \"and in consequence I dare to pass the Princess, against\nwhom certainly nothing can be planned.\"\n\n\"Why, in that event,\" Sire Edward said, \"we two had as well bid each\nother adieu.\"\n\nBut Meregrett only said, \"You bid me go?\"\n\nHe waved his hand. \"Since there is no choice. For that which you have\ndone--however tardily--I thank you. Meantime I return to Rigon's hut to\nrearrange my toga as King Caesar did when the assassins fell upon him,\nand to encounter with due decorum whatever Dame Luck may prefer.\"\n\nShe said, \"You go to your death.\"\n\nHe shrugged his broad shoulders. \"In the end we necessarily die.\"\n\nDame Meregrett turned, and without faltering passed back into the hut.\n\nWhen he had lighted the inefficient lamp which he found there, Sire\nEdward wheeled upon her in half-humorous vexation. \"Presently come your\nbrother and his tattling lords. To be discovered here with me at night,\nalone, means trouble for you. If Philippe chances to fall into one of\nhis Capetian rages it means death.\"\n\nShe answered, as though she were thinking about other matters, \"Yes.\"\n\nNow, for the first time, Sire Edward regarded her with profound\nconsideration. To the finger-tips this so-little lady showed a\ndescendant of the holy Lewis whom he had known and loved in old years.\nSmall and thinnish she was, with soft and profuse hair that, for all its\nblackness, gleamed in the lamplight with stray ripples of brilliancy, as\nyou may see sparks shudder to extinction over burning charcoal. She had\nthe Valois nose, long and delicate in form, and overhanging a short\nupper-lip; yet the lips were glorious in tint, and the whiteness of her\nskin would have matched the Hyperborean snows tidily enough. As for her\neyes, the customary similes of the court poets were gigantic onyxes or\nebony highly polished and wet with May dew. These eyes were too big for\nher little face: they made of her a tiny and desirous wraith which\nnervously endured each incident of life, like a foreigner uneasily\nacquiescent to the custom of the country.\n\nSire Edward moved one step toward this tiny lady and paused. \"Madame, I\ndo not understand.\"\n\nDame Meregrett looked up into his face unflinchingly. \"It means that I\nlove you, sire. I may speak without shame now, for presently you die.\nDie bravely, sire! Die in such fashion as may hearten me to live.\"\n\nThe little Princess spoke the truth, for always since his coming to\nMezelais she had viewed the great conqueror as through an aweful haze of\nforerunning rumor, twin to that golden vapor which enswathes a god and\ntransmutes whatever in corporeal man would have been a defect into some\ndivine and hitherto unguessed-at excellence. I must tell you in this\nplace, since no other occasion offers, that even until the end of her\nlife it was so. For to her what in other persons would have seemed\nflagrant dulness showed somehow, in Sire Edward, as the majestic\ndeliberation of one that knows his verdict to be decisive, and therefore\nappraises cautiously; and if sometimes his big, irregular calm eyes\nbetrayed no apprehension of the jest at which her lips were laughing,\nand of which her brain approved, always within the instant her heart\nconvinced her that a god is not lightly moved to mirth.\n\nAnd now it was a god--_O deus cert\u00e8!_--who had taken a woman's paltry\nface between his hands, half roughly. \"And the maid is a Capet!\" Sire\nEdward mused.\n\n\"Blanch has never desired you any ill, beau sire. But she loves the\nArchduke of Austria. And once you were dead, she might marry him. One\ncannot blame her,\" Meregrett considered, \"since he wishes to marry her,\nand she, of course, wishes to make him happy.\"\n\n\"And not herself, save in some secondary way!\" the big King said. \"In\npart I comprehend, madame. Now I too hanker after this same happiness,\nand my admiration for the cantankerous despoiler whom I praised this\nmorning is somewhat abated. There was a Tenson once--Lord, Lord, how\nlong ago! I learn too late that truth may possibly have been upon the\nlosing side--\" Thus talking incoherencies, he took up Rigon's lute.\n\nSang Sire Edward:\n\n  \"Incuriously he smites the armored king\n  And tricks his counsellors--\n\n\"yes, the jingle ran thus. Now listen, madame--listen, the while that I\nhave my singing out, whatever any little cut-throats may be planning in\ncorners.\"\n\nSang Sire Edward:\n\n  \"As, later on,\n  Death will, half-idly, still our pleasuring,\n  And change for fevered laughter in the sun\n  Sleep such as Merlin's,--and excess thereof,--\n  Whence we, divorceless Death our Viviaine\n  Implacable, may never more regain\n  The unforgotten rapture, and the pain\n  And grief and ecstasy of life and love.\n\n  \"For, presently, as quiet as the king\n  Sleeps now that planned the keeps of Ilion,\n  We, too, will sleep, whilst overhead the spring\n  Rules, and young lovers laugh--as we have done,--\n  And kiss--as we, that take no heed thereof,\n  But slumber very soundly, and disdain\n  The world-wide heralding of winter's wane\n  And swift sweet ripple of the April rain\n  Running about the world to waken love.\n\n  \"We shall have done with Love, and Death be king\n  And turn our nimble bodies carrion,\n  Our red lips dusty;--yet our live lips cling\n  Despite that age-long severance and are one\n  Despite the grave and the vain grief thereof,--\n  Which we will baffle, if in Death's domain\n  Fond memories may enter, and we twain\n  May dream a little, and rehearse again\n  In that unending sleep our present love.\n\n  \"Speed forth to her in halting unison,\n  My rhymes: and say no hindrance may restrain\n  Love from his aim when Love is bent thereon;\n  And that were love at my disposal lain--\n  All mine to take!--and Death had said, 'Refrain,\n  Lest I, even I, exact the cost thereof,'\n  I know that even as the weather-vane\n  Follows the wind so would I follow Love.\"\n\nSire Edward put aside the lute. \"Thus ends the Song of Service,\" he\nsaid, \"which was made not by the King of England but by Edward\nPlantagenet--hot-blooded and desirous man!--in honor of the one woman\nwho within more years than I care to think of has at all considered\nEdward Plantagenet.\"\n\n\"I do not comprehend,\" she said. And, indeed, she dared not.\n\nBut now he held both tiny hands in his. \"At best, your poet is an\negotist. I must die presently. Meantime I crave largesse, madame, and a\ngreat almsgiving, so that in his unending sleep your poet may rehearse\nour present love.\" And even in Rigon's dim light he found her kindling\neyes not niggardly.\n\nSire Edward strode to the window and raised big hands toward the\nspear-points of the aloof stars. \"Master of us all!\" he cried; \"O Father\nof us all! the Hammer of the Scots am I! the Scourge of France, the\nconqueror of Llewellyn and of Leicester, and the flail of the accursed\nrace that slew Thine only Son! the King of England am I, who have made\nof England an imperial nation, and have given to Thy Englishmen new\nlaws! And to-night I crave my hire. Never, O my Father, have I had of\nany person aught save reverence or hatred! never in my life has any\nperson loved me! And I am old, my Father--I am old, and presently I die.\nAs I have served Thee--as Jacob wrestled with Thee at the ford of\nJabbok--at the place of Peniel--\" Against the tremulous blue and silver\nof the forest the Princess saw how horribly the big man was shaken. \"My\nhire! my hire!\" he hoarsely said. \"Forty long years, my Father! And now\nI will not let Thee go except Thou hear me, and grant me life and this\nwoman's love.\"\n\nHe turned, stark and black in the rearward splendor of the moon. _\"As a\nprince hast thou power with God,\"_ he calmly said, _\"and thou hast\nprevailed._ For the King of kings was never obdurate, my dear, to them\nthat have deserved well of Him. So He will attend to my request, and\nwill get us out of this pickle somehow.\"\n\nEven as he said this, Philippe the Handsome came into the room, and at\nthe heels of the French King were seven lords, armed cap-\u00e0-pie.\n\nThe French King was an odd man. Subtly smiling, he came forward through\nthe twilight, with soft, long strides, and he made no outcry at\nrecognition of his sister. \"Take the woman away, Victor,\" he said,\ndisinterestedly, to de Montespan. Afterward he sat down beside the table\nand remained silent for a while, intently regarding Sire Edward and the\ntiny woman who clung to Sire Edward's arm; and in the flickering gloom\nof the hut Philippe smiled as an artist may smile who gazes on the\nperfected work and knows it to be adroit.\n\n\"You prefer to remain, my sister?\" he said presently. \"H\u00e9 bien! it\nhappens that to-night I am in a mood for granting almost any favor. A\nlittle later and I will attend to your merits.\" The fleet disorder of\nhis visage had lapsed again into the meditative smile which was that of\nLucifer watching a toasted soul. \"And so it ends,\" he said, \"and England\nloses to-night the heir that Manuel the Redeemer provided. Conqueror of\nScotland, Scourge of France! O unconquerable king! and will the worms of\nErmenoue\u00efl, then, pause to-morrow to consider through what a glorious\nturmoil their dinner came to them?\"\n\n\"Do you design to murder me?\" Sire Edward said.\n\nThe French King shrugged. \"I design that within this moment my lords\nshall slay you while I sit here and do not move a finger. Is it not good\nto be a king, my cousin, and to sit quite still, and to see your\nbitterest enemy hacked and slain,--and all the while to sit quite still,\nquite unruffled, as a king should always be? Eh, eh! I never lived until\nto-night!\"\n\n\"Now, by Heaven,\" said Sire Edward, \"I am your kinsman and your guest, I\nam unarmed--\"\n\nPhilippe bowed his head. \"Undoubtedly,\" he assented, \"the deed is foul.\nBut I desire Gascony very earnestly, and so long as you live you will\nnever permit me to retain Gascony. Hence it is quite necessary, you\nconceive, that I murder you. What!\" he presently said, \"will you not beg\nfor mercy? I had hoped,\" the French King added, somewhat wistfully,\n\"that you might be afraid to die, O huge and righteous man! and would\nentreat me to spare you. To spurn the weeping conqueror of Llewellyn,\nsay ... But these sins which damn one's soul are in actual performance\nvery tedious affairs; and I begin to grow aweary of the game. H\u00e9 bien!\nnow kill this man for me, messieurs.\"\n\nThe English King strode forward. \"Shallow trickster!\" Sire Edward\nthundered. _\"Am I not afraid?_ You grimacing baby, do you think to\nensnare a lion with such a flimsy rat-trap? Wise persons do not hunt\nlions with these contraptions: for it is the nature of a rat-trap, fair\ncousin, to ensnare not the beast which imperiously desires and takes in\ndaylight, but the tinier and the filthier beast that covets meanly and\nattacks under the cover of darkness--as do you and your seven skulkers!\"\nThe man was rather terrible; not a Frenchman within the hut but had\ndrawn back a little.\n\n\"Listen!\" Sire Edward said, and he came yet farther toward the King of\nFrance and shook at him one forefinger; \"when you were in your cradle I\nwas leading armies. When you were yet unbreeched I was lord of half\nEurope. For thirty years I have driven kings before me as did Fierabras.\nAm I, then, a person to be hoodwinked by the first big-bosomed huzzy\nthat elects to waggle her fat shoulders and to grant an assignation in a\nforest expressly designed for stabbings? You baby, is the Hammer of the\nScots the man to trust for one half moment a Capet? Ill-mannered\ninfant,\" the King said, with bitter laughter, \"it is now necessary that\nI summon my attendants and remove you to a nursery which I have prepared\nin England.\" He set the horn to his lips and blew three blasts. There\ncame many armed warriors into the hut, bearing ropes. Here was the\nentire retinue of the Earl of Aquitaine. Cursing, Sire Philippe sprang\nupon the English King, and with a dagger smote at the impassive big\nman's heart. The blade broke against the mail armor under the tunic.\n\"Have I not told you,\" Sire Edward wearily said, \"that one may never\ntrust a Capet? Now, messieurs, bind these carrion and convey them\nwhither I have directed you. Nay, but, Roger--\" He conversed apart with\nhis son, the Earl of Pevensey, and what Sire Edward commanded was done.\nThe French King and seven lords of France went from that hut trussed\nlike chickens ready for the oven.\n\nAnd now Sire Edward turned toward Meregrett and chafed his big hands\ngleefully. \"At every tree-bole a tethered horse awaits us; and a ship\nawaits our party at F\u00e9camp. To-morrow we sleep in England--and, Mort de\nDieu! do you not think, madame, that once within my very persuasive\nTower of London, your brother and I may come to some agreement over\nGuienne?\"\n\nShe had shrunk from him. \"Then the trap was yours? It was you that lured\nmy brother to this infamy!\"\n\n\"In effect, I planned it many months ago at Ipswich yonder,\" Sire Edward\ngayly said. \"Faith of a gentleman! your brother has cheated me of\nGuienne, and was I to waste eternity in begging him to give me back my\nprovince? Oh, no, for I have many spies in France, and have for some two\nyears known your brother and your sister to the bottom. Granted that I\ncame hither incognito, to forecast your kinfolk's immediate endeavors\nwas none too difficult; and I wanted Guienne--and, in consequence, the\nperson of your brother. Hah, death of my life! does not the seasoned\nhunter adapt his snare to the qualities of his prey, and take the\nelephant through his curiosity, as the snake through his notorious\ntreachery?\" Now the King of England blustered.\n\nBut the little Princess wrung her hands. \"I am this night most hideously\nshamed. Beau sire, I came hither to aid a brave man infamously trapped,\nand instead I find an alert spider, snug in his cunning web, and\npatiently waiting until the gnats of France fly near enough. Eh, the\ngreater fool was I to waste my labor on the shrewd and evil thing which\nhas no more need of me than I of it! And now let me go hence, sire,\nunmolested, for the sake of chivalry. Could I have come to the brave man\nI had dreamed of, I would have come cheerily through the murkiest lane\nof hell; as the more artful knave, as the more judicious trickster\"--and\nhere she thrust him from her--\"I spit upon you. Now let me go hence.\"\n\nHe took her in his brawny arms. \"Fit mate for me,\" he said. \"Little\nvixen, had you done otherwise I would have devoted you to the devil.\"\n\nStill grasping her, and victoriously lifting Dame Meregrett, so that\nher feet swung clear of the floor, Sire Edward said, again with that\nqueer touch of fanatic gravity: \"My dear, you are perfectly right. I was\ntempted, I grant you. But it was never reasonable that gentlefolk should\ncheat at their dicing. Therefore I whispered Roger Bulmer my final\ndecision; and he is now loosing all my captives in the courtyard of\nMezelais, after birching the tails of every one of them as soundly as\nthese infants' pranks to-night have merited. So you perceive that I do\nnot profit by my trick; and that I lose Guienne, after all, in order to\ncome to you with hands--well! not intolerably soiled.\"\n\n\"Oh, now I love you!\" she cried, a-thrill with disappointment to find\nhim so unthriftily high-minded. \"Yet you have done wrong, for Guienne is\na king's ransom.\"\n\nHe smiled whimsically, and presently one arm swept beneath her knees, so\nthat presently he held her as one dandles a baby; and presently his\nstiff and graying beard caressed her burning cheek. Masterfully he said:\n\"Then let Guienne serve as such and ransom for a king his glad and\ncommon manhood. Now it appears expedient that I leave France without any\nunwholesome delay, because these children may resent being spanked. More\nlately--h\u00e9, already I have in my pocket the Pope's dispensation\npermitting me to marry, in spite of our cousinship, the sister of the\nKing of France.\"\n\nVery shyly Dame Meregrett lifted her little mouth. She said nothing\nbecause talk was not necessary.\n\nIn consequence, after a deal of political tergiversation (Nicolas\nconcludes), in the year of grace 1299, on the day of our Lady's\nnativity, and in the twenty-seventh year of King Edward's reign, came to\nthe British realm, and landed at Dover, not Dame Blanch, as would have\nbeen in consonance with seasoned expectation, but Dame Meregrett, the\nother daughter of King Philippe the Bold; and upon the following day\nproceeded to Canterbury, whither on the next Thursday after came Edward,\nKing of England, into the Church of the Trinity at Canterbury, and\ntherein espoused the aforesaid Dame Meregrett.\n\nTHE END OF THE THIRD NOVEL\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE STORY OF THE CHOICES\n\n\n  \"Sest fable es en aquest mon\n  Semblans al homes que i son;\n  Que el mager sen qu'om pot aver\n  So es amar Dieu et sa mer,\n  E gardar sos comendamens.\"\n\nTHE FOURTH NOVEL.--YSABEAU OF FRANCE, DESIROUS OF DISTRACTION, LOOKS FOR\nRECREATION IN THE TORMENT OF A CERTAIN KNIGHT, WHOM SHE PROVES TO BE NO\nMORE THAN HUMAN; BUT IN THE OUTCOME OF HER HOLIDAY HE CONFOUNDS THIS\nQUEEN BY THE WIT OF HIS REPLY.\n\n\n\n\nThe Story of the Choices\n\n\nIn the year of grace 1327 (thus Nicolas begins) you could have found in\nall England no couple more ardent in affection or in despair more\naffluent than Rosamund Eastney and Sir Gregory Darrell. She was Lord\nBerners' only daughter, a brown beauty, of extensive repute, thanks to a\nretinue of lovers who were practitioners of the Gay Science, and who had\nscattered broadcast innumerable Canzons in her honor; and Lord Berners\nwas a man to accept the world as he found it.\n\n\"Dompnedex!\" the Earl was wont to say; \"in sincerity I am fond of\nGregory Darrell, and if he chooses to make love to my daughter that is\nnone of my affair. The eyes and the brain preserve a proverbial warfare,\nwhich is the source of all amenity, for without lady-service there would\nbe no songs and tourneys, no measure and no good breeding; and a man\ndelinquent in domnei is no more to be valued than an ear of corn\nwithout the grain. No, I am so profoundly an admirer of Love that I can\nnever willingly behold him slain, of a surfeit, by Matrimony; besides,\nthis rapscallion Gregory could not to advantage exchange purses with\nLazarus in the parable; and, moreover, Rosamund is to marry the Earl of\nSarum a little after All Saints' day.\"\n\n\"Sarum!\" people echoed. \"Why, the old goat has had four wives already!\"\n\nAnd the Earl would spread his hands. \"These redundancies are permissible\nto one of the wealthiest persons in England,\" he was used to submit.\n\nThus it fell out that Sir Gregory came and went at his own discretion as\nconcerned Lord Berners' fief of Ordish, all through those choppy times\nof warfare between Sire Edward and Queen Ysabeau. Lord Berners, for one,\nvexed himself not inordinately over the outcome, since he protested the\nKing's armament to consist of fools and the Queen's of rascals; and had\nwith entire serenity declined to back either Dick or the devil.\n\nBut at last the Queen got resistless aid from Count William of Hainault\n(in a way to be told about hereafter), and the King was captured by her\nforces, and was imprisoned in Berkeley Castle. There they held the\nsecond Edward to reign in England, who was the unworthy son of Dame\nEllinor and of that first squinting King Edward about whom I have told\nyou in the two tales preceding this tale. It was in the September of\nthis year, a little before Michaelmas, that they brought Sir Gregory\nDarrell to be judged by the Queen; notoriously the knight had been her\nhusband's adherent. \"Death!\" croaked Adam Orleton, who sat to the right\nhand, and, \"Young de Spencer's death!\" amended the Earl of March, with\nwild laughter; but Ysabeau leaned back in her great chair--a handsome\nwoman, stoutening now from gluttony and from too much wine,--and\nregarded her prisoner with lazy amiability.\n\n\"And what was your errand in Figgis Wood?\" she demanded--\"or are you\nmad, then, Gregory Darrell, that you dare ride past my gates alone?\"\n\nHe curtly said, \"I rode for Ordish.\"\n\nFollowed silence. \"Roger,\" the Queen ordered, \"give me the paper which I\nwould not sign.\"\n\nThe Earl of March had drawn an audible breath. The Bishop of London\nsomewhat wrinkled his shaggy brows, like a person in shrewd and\nepicurean amusement, while the Queen subscribed the parchment, with a\ngreat scrawling flourish.\n\n\"Take, in the devil's name, the hire of your dexterities,\" said Ysabeau.\nShe pushed this document with her wet pen-point toward March. \"So! get\nit over with, that necessary business with my husband at Berkeley. And\ndo the rest of you withdraw, saving only my prisoner.\"\n\nFollowed another silence. Queen Ysabeau lolled in her carven chair,\nconsidering the comely gentleman who stood before her, fettered, at the\npoint of shameful death. There was in the room a little dog which had\ncome to the Queen, and now licked the palm of her left hand, and the\nsoft lapping of its tongue was the only sound you heard. \"So at peril of\nyour life you rode for Ordish, then, messire?\"\n\nThe tense man had flushed. \"You have harried us of the King's party out\nof England,--and in reason I might not leave England without seeing the\ndesire of my heart.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Ysabeau, as if half in sorrow, \"I would have pardoned\nanything save that.\" She rose. Her face was dark and hot. \"By God and\nall His saints! you shall indeed leave England to-morrow and the world\nalso! but not without a final glimpse of this same Rosamund. Yet listen:\nI, too, must ride with you to Ordish--as your sister, say--Gregory, did\nI not hang, last April, the husband of your sister? Yes, Ralph de\nBelomys, a thin man with eager eyes, the Earl of Farrington he was. As\nhis widow I will ride with you to Ordish, upon condition you disclose to\nnone at Ordish, saving only, if you will, this quite immaculate\nRosamund, any hint of our merry carnival. And to-morrow (you will swear\naccording to the nicest obligations of honor) you must ride back with me\nto encounter--that which I may devise. For I dare to trust your naked\nword in this, and, moreover, I shall take with me a sufficiency of\nretainers to leave you no choice.\"\n\nDarrell knelt before her. \"I can do no homage to Queen Ysabeau; yet the\nprodigal hands of her who knows that I must die to-morrow and cunningly\ncontrives, for old time's sake, to hearten me with a sight of Rosamund,\nI cannot but kiss.\" This much he did. \"And I swear in all things to obey\nyour will.\"\n\n\"O comely fool!\" the Queen said, not ungently, \"I contrive, it may be,\nbut to demonstrate that many tyrants of antiquity were only bunglers.\nAnd, besides, I must have other thoughts than those which I have known\ntoo long: I must this night take holiday from thinking them, lest I go\nmad.\"\n\nThus did the Queen arrange her holiday.\n\n\"Either I mean to torture you to-morrow,\" Dame Ysabeau said, presently,\nto Darrell, as these two rode side by side, \"or else I mean to free you.\nIn sober verity I do not know. I am in a holiday humor, and it is as the\nwhim may take me. But do you indeed love this Rosamund Eastney? And of\ncourse she worships you?\"\n\n\"It is my belief, madame, that when I see her I tremble visibly, and my\nweakness is such that a child has more intelligence than I,--and toward\nsuch misery any lady must in common reason be a little compassionate.\"\n\nHer hands had twitched so that the astonished palfrey reared. \"I design\ntorture,\" the Queen said; \"ah, I perfect exquisite torture, for you have\nproven recreant, you have forgotten the maid Ysabeau,--Le Desir du\nCuer, was it not, my Gregory, that you were wont to call her, as\nnowadays this Rosamund is the desire of your heart. You lack\ninventiveness.\"\n\nHis palms clutched at heaven. \"That Ysabeau is dead! and all true joy is\ndestroyed, and the world lies under a blight from which God has averted\nan unfriendly face in displeasure! yet of all wretched persons existent\nI am he who endures the most grievous anguish, for daily I partake of\nlife without any relish, and I would in truth deem him austerely kind\nwho slew me now that the maiden Ysabeau is dead.\"\n\nShe shrugged wearily. \"I scent the raw stuff of a Planh,\" the Queen\nobserved; \"_benedicite!_ it was ever your way, my friend, to love a\nwoman chiefly for the verses she inspired.\" And she began to sing, as\nthey rode through Baverstock Thicket.\n\nSang Ysabeau:\n\n  \"Man's love hath many prompters,\n  But a woman's love hath none;\n  And he may woo a nimble wit\n  Or hair that shames the sun,\n  Whilst she must pick of all one man\n  And ever brood thereon--\n  And for no reason,\n  And not rightly,--\n\n  \"Save that the plan was foreordained\n  (More old than Chalcedon,\n  Or any tower of Tarshish\n  Or of gleaming Babylon),\n  That she must love unwillingly\n  And love till life be done,--.\n  He for a season,\n  And more lightly.\"\n\nSo to Ordish in that twilight came the Countess of Farrington, with a\nretinue of twenty men-at-arms, and her brother Sir Gregory Darrell. Lord\nBerners received the party with boisterous hospitality.\n\n\"Age has not blinded Father to the fact that your sister is a very\nhandsome woman,\" was Rosamund Eastney's comment. The period appears to\nhave been after supper, and the girl sat with Gregory Darrell in not the\nmost brilliant corner of the main hall.\n\nThe wretched man leaned forward, bit his nether-lip, and then with a\ntumbling rush of speech told of the sorry masquerade. \"The she-devil\ndesigns some horrible and obscure mischief, she plans I know not what.\"\n\n\"Yet I--\" said Rosamund. The girl had risen, and she continued with an\nodd inconsequence: \"You have told me you were Pembroke's squire when\nlong ago he sailed for France to fetch this woman into England--\"\n\n\"--Which you never heard!\" Lord Berners shouted at this point. \"Jasper,\na lute!\" And then he halloaed, \"Gregory, Madame de Farrington demands\nthat racy song you made against Queen Ysabeau during your last visit.\"\nThus did the Queen begin her holiday.\n\nIt was a handsome couple which came forward, with hand quitting hand\ntardily, and with blinking eyes yet rapt: these two were not overpleased\nat being disturbed, and the man was troubled, as in reason he well might\nbe, by the task assigned him.\n\n\"Is it, indeed, your will, my sister,\" he said, \"that I should\nsing--this song?\"\n\n\"It is my will,\" the Countess said.\n\nAnd the knight flung back his comely head and laughed. \"A truth, once\nspoken, may not be disowned in any company. It is not, look you, of my\nown choice that I sing, my sister. Yet if Queen Ysabeau herself were to\nbid me sing this song, I could not refuse, for, Christ aid me! the song\nis true.\"\n\nSang Sir Gregory:\n\n  \"Dame Ysabeau, la proph\u00e9cie\n  Que li sage dit ne ment mie,\n  Que la royne sut ceus grever\n  Qui tantost laquais sot aymer--\"[4]\n\nand so on. It was a lengthy ditty, and in its wording not oversqueamish;\nthe Queen's career in England was detailed without any stuttering, and\nyou would have found the catalogue unhandsome. Yet Sir Gregory delivered\nit with an incisive gusto, desperately countersigning his own death\nwarrant. Her treacheries, her adulteries and her assassinations were\nrendered in glowing terms whose vigor seemed, even now, to please their\ncontriver. Yet the minstrel added a new peroration.\n\nSang Sir Gregory:\n\n  \"Ma voix mocque, mon cuer g\u00e9mit--\n  Peu pense \u00e0 ce que la voix dit,\n  Car me membre du temps jadis\n  Et d'ung garson, d'amour surpris,\n  Et d'une fille--et la vois si--\n  Et grandement suis esbahi.\"\n\nAnd when Darrell had ended, the Countess of Farrington, without\nspeaking, swept her left hand toward her cheek and by pure chance caught\nbetween thumb and forefinger the autumn-numbed fly that had annoyed her.\nShe drew the little dagger from her girdle and meditatively cut the\nbuzzing thing in two. She cast the fragments from her, and resting the\ndagger's point upon the arm of her chair, one forefinger upon the summit\nof the hilt, considerately twirled the brilliant weapon.\n\n\"This song does not err upon the side of clemency,\" she said at last,\n\"nor by ordinary does Queen Ysabeau.\"\n\n\"That she-wolf!\" said Lord Berners, comfortably. \"Hoo, Madame Gertrude!\nsince the Prophet Moses wrung healing waters from a rock there has been\nno such miracle recorded.\"\n\n\"We read, Messire de Berners, that when the she-wolf once acknowledges a\nmaster she will follow him as faithfully as any dog. My brother, I do\nnot question your sincerity, yet everybody knows you sing with the voice\nof an unhonored courtier. Suppose Queen Ysabeau had heard your song all\nthrough as I have heard it, and then had said--for she is not as the run\nof women--'Messire, I had thought until this that there was no thorough\nman in England save tall Roger Mortimer. I find him tawdry now, and--I\nremember. Come you, then, and rule the England that you love as you may\nlove no woman, and rule me, messire, since I find even in your\ncruelty--For we are no pygmies, you and I! Yonder is squabbling Europe\nand all the ancient gold of Africa, ready for our taking! and past that\nlies Asia, too, and its painted houses hung with bells, and cloud-wrapt\nTartary, where we two may yet erect our equal thrones, upon which to\nreceive the tributary emperors! For we are no pygmies, you and I.\" She\npaused. She shrugged. \"Suppose Queen Ysabeau, who is not as the run of\nwomen, had said this much, my brother?\"\n\nDarrell was more pallid (as the phrase is) than a sheet, and the lute\nhad dropped unheeded, and his hands were clenched.\n\n\"I would answer, my sister, that as she has found in England but one\nman, I have found in England but one woman--the rose of all the world.\"\nHis eyes were turned at this toward Rosamund Eastney. \"And yet,\" the man\nstammered, \"because I, too, remember--\"\n\n\"Hah, in God's name! I am answered,\" the Countess said. She rose, in\ndignity almost a queen. \"We have ridden far to-day, and to-morrow we\nmust travel a deal farther--eh, my brother? I am going to bed, Messire\nde Berners.\"\n\nSo the men and women parted. Madame de Farrington kissed her brother at\nleaving him, as was natural; and under her caress his stalwart person\nshuddered, but not in repugnance; and the Queen went away singing\nhushedly.\n\nSang Ysabeau:\n\n  \"Were the All-Mother wise, life (shaped anotherwise)\n  Would be all high and true;\n  Could I be otherwise I had been otherwise\n  Simply because of you, ...\n  With whom I have naught to do,\n  And who are no longer you!\n\n  \"Life with its pay to be bade us essay to be\n  What we became,--I believe\n  Were there a way to be what it was play to be\n  I would not greatly grieve ...\n  Hearts are not worn on the sleeve.\n  Let us neither laugh nor grieve!\"\n\nYsabeau would have slept that night within the chamber of Rosamund\nEastney had either slept. As concerns the older I say nothing. The girl,\nthough soon aware of frequent rustlings near at hand, lay quiet,\nhalf-forgetful of the poisonous woman yonder. The girl was now fulfilled\nwith a great blaze of exultation: to-morrow Gregory must die, and then\nperhaps she might find time for tears; meanwhile, before her eyes, the\nman had flung away a kingdom and life itself for love of her, and the\nleast nook of her heart ached to be a shade more worthy of the\nsacrifice.\n\nAfter it might have been an hour of this excruciate ecstasy the Countess\ncame to Rosamund's bed. \"Ay,\" the woman began, \"it is indisputable that\nhis hair is like spun gold and that his eyes resemble sun-drenched\nwaters in June. It is certain that when this Gregory laughs God is more\nhappy. Girl, I was familiar with the routine of your meditations before\nyou were born.\"\n\nRosamund said, quite simply: \"You have known him always. I envy the\ncircumstance, Madame Gertrude--you alone of all women in the world I\nenvy, since you, his sister, being so much older, must have known him\nalways.\"\n\n\"I know him to the core, my girl,\" the Countess answered. For a while\nshe sat silent, one bare foot jogging restlessly. \"Yet I am two years\nhis junior--Did you hear nothing, Rosamund?\" \"No, Madame Gertrude, I\nheard nothing.\"\n\n\"Strange!\" the Countess said; \"let us have lights, since I can no longer\nendure this overpopulous twilight.\" She kindled, with twitching fingers,\nthree lamps. \"It is as yet dark yonder, where the shadows quiver very\noddly, as though they would rise from the floor--do they not, my\ngirl?--and protest vain things. But, Rosamund, it has been done; in the\nmoment of death men's souls have travelled farther and have been\nvisible; it has been done, I tell you. And he would stand before me,\nwith pleading eyes, and would reproach me in a voice too faint to reach\nmy ears--but I would see him--and his groping hands would clutch at my\nhands as though a dropped veil had touched me, and with the contact I\nwould go mad!\"\n\n\"Madame Gertrude!\" the girl stammered, in communicated terror.\n\n\"Poor innocent fool!\" the woman said, \"I am Ysabeau of France.\" And when\nRosamund made as though to rise, in alarm, Queen Ysabeau caught her by\nthe shoulder. \"Bear witness when he comes that I never hated him. Yet\nfor my quiet it was necessary that it suffer so cruelly, the scented,\npampered body, and no mark be left upon it! Eia! even now he suffers!\nNo, I have lied. I hate the man, and in such fashion as you will\ncomprehend when you are Sarum's wife.\"\n\n\"Madame and Queen!\" the girl said, \"you will not murder me!\" \"I am\ntempted!\" the Queen answered. \"O little slip of girlhood, I am tempted,\nfor it is not reasonable you should possess everything that I have lost.\nInnocence you have, and youth, and untroubled eyes, and quiet dreams,\nand the fond graveness of a child, and Gregory Darrell's love--\" Now\nYsabeau sat down upon the bed and caught up the girl's face between two\nfevered hands. \"Rosamund, this Darrell perceives within the moment, as I\ndo, that the love he bears for you is but what he remembers of the love\nhe bore a certain maid long dead. Eh, you might have been her sister,\nRosamund, for you are very like her. And she, poor wench--why, I could\nsee her now, I think, were my eyes not blurred, somehow, almost as\nthough Queen Ysabeau might weep! But she was handsomer than you, since\nyour complexion is not overclear, praise God!\"\n\nWoman against woman they were. \"He has told me of his intercourse with\nyou,\" the girl said, and this was a lie flatfooted. \"Nay, kill me if you\nwill, madame, since you are the stronger, yet, with my dying breath, I\nprotest that Gregory has loved no woman truly in all his life except\nme.\"\n\nThe Queen laughed bitterly. \"Do I not know men? He told you nothing. And\nto-night he hesitated, and to-morrow, at the lifting of my finger, he\nwill supplicate. Since boyhood Gregory Darrell has loved me, O white,\npalsied innocence! and he is mine at a whistle. And in that time to\ncome he will desert you, Rosamund--bidding farewell with a pleasing\nCanzon,--and they will give you to the gross Earl of Sarum, as they gave\nme to the painted man who was of late our King! and in that time to come\nyou will know your body to be your husband's makeshift when he lacks\nleisure to seek out other recreation! and in that time to come you will\nlong for death, and presently your heart will be a flame within you, my\nRosamund, an insatiable flame! and you will hate your God because He\nmade you, and hate Satan because in some desperate hour he tricked you,\nand hate all men because, poor fools, they scurry to obey your whims!\nand chiefly you will hate yourself because you are so pitiable! and\ndevastation only will you love in that strange time which is to come. It\nis adjacent, my Rosamund.\"\n\nThe girl kept silence. She sat erect in the tumbled bed, her hands\nclasping her knees, and she appeared to deliberate what Dame Ysabeau had\nsaid. Plentiful brown hair fell about this Rosamund's face, which was\nwhite and shrewd. \"A part of what you say, madame, I understand. I know\nthat Gregory Darrell loves me, yet I have long ago acknowledged he loves\nme as one pets a child, or, let us say, a spaniel which reveres and\namuses one. I lack his wit, you comprehend, and so he never speaks to me\nall that he thinks. Yet a part of it he tells me, and he loves me, and\nwith this I am content. Assuredly, if they give me to Sarum I shall hate\nSarum even more than I detest him now. And then, I think, Heaven help\nme! that I would not greatly grieve--Oh, you are all evil!\" Rosamund\nsaid; \"and you thrust into my mind thoughts which I may not understand!\"\n\n\"You will comprehend them,\" the Queen said, \"when you know yourself a\nchattel, bought and paid for.\"\n\nThe Queen laughed. She rose, and her hands strained toward heaven. \"You\nare omnipotent, yet have You let me become that into which I am\ntransmuted,\" she said, very low.\n\nShe began to speak as though a statue spoke through lips that seemed\nmotionless. \"Men have long urged me, Rosamund, to a deed which by one\nstroke would make me mistress of these islands. To-day I looked on\nGregory Darrell, and knew that I was wise in love--and I had but to\ncrush a lewd soft worm to come to him. Eh, and I was tempted--!\"\n\nThe girl said: \"Let us grant that Gregory loves you very greatly, and me\njust when his leisure serves. You may offer him a cushioned infamy, a\ncolorful and brief delirium, and afterward demolishment of soul and\nbody; I offer him contentment and a level life, made up of small events,\nit may be, and lacking both in abysses and in skyey heights. Yet is love\na flame wherein the lover's soul must be purified; it is a flame which\nassays high queens just as it does their servants: and thus, madame, to\njudge between us I dare summon you.\" \"Child, child!\" the Queen said,\ntenderly, and with a smile, \"you are brave; and in your fashion you are\nwise; yet you will never comprehend. But once I was in heart and soul\nand body all that you are to-day; and now I am Queen Ysabeau--Did you in\ntruth hear nothing, Rosamund?\"\n\n\"Why, nothing save the wind.\"\n\n\"Strange!\" said the Queen; \"since all the while that I have talked with\nyou I have been seriously annoyed by shrieks and imprecations! But I,\ntoo, grow cowardly, it may be--Nay, I know,\" she said, and in a resonant\nvoice, \"that by this I am mistress of broad England, until my son--my\nown son, born of my body, and in glad anguish, Rosamund--knows me for\nwhat I am. For I have heard--Coward! O beautiful sleek coward!\" the\nQueen said; \"I would have died without lamentation and I was but your\nplaything!\"\n\n\"Madame Ysabeau--!\" the girl answered vaguely, for she was puzzled and\nwas almost frightened by the other's strange talk.\n\n\"To bed!\" said Ysabeau; \"and put out the lights lest he come presently.\nOr perhaps he fears me now too much to come to-night. Yet the night\napproaches, none the less, when I must lift some arras and find him\nthere, chalk-white, with painted cheeks, and rigid, and smiling very\nterribly, or look into some mirror and behold there not myself but\nhim,--and in that instant I shall die. Meantime I rule, until my son\nattains his manhood. Eh, Rosamund, my only son was once so tiny, and so\nhelpless, and his little crimson mouth groped toward me, helplessly, and\nsave in Bethlehem, I thought, there was never any child more fair--But I\nmust forget all that, for even now he plots. Hey, God orders matters\nvery shrewdly, my Rosamund.\"\n\nTimidly the girl touched Ysabeau's shoulder. \"In part, I understand,\nmadame and Queen.\"\n\n\"You understand nothing,\" said Ysabeau; \"how should you understand whose\nbreasts are yet so tiny? So let us put out the light! though I dread\ndarkness, Rosamund--For they say that hell is poorly lighted--and they\nsay--\" Then Queen Ysabeau shrugged. Pensively she blew out each lamp.\n\n\"We know this Gregory Darrell,\" the Queen said in the darkness, \"ah, to\nthe marrow we know him, however steadfastly we blink, and we know the\npresent turmoil of his soul; and in common-sense what chance have you of\nvictory?\"\n\n\"None in common-sense, madame, and yet you go too fast. For man is a\nbeing of mingled nature, we are told by those in holy orders, and his\nlife here is one unending warfare between that which is divine in him\nand that which is bestial, while impartial Heaven attends as arbiter of\nthe tourney. Always a man's judgment misleads him and his faculties\nallure him to a truce, however brief, with iniquity. His senses raise a\nmist about his goings, and there is not an endowment of the man but in\nthe end plays traitor to his interest, as of God's wisdom God intends;\nso that when the man is overthrown, the Eternal Father may, in reason,\nbe neither vexed nor grieved if only the man takes heart to rise again.\nAnd when, betrayed and impotent, the man elects to fight out the\nallotted battle, defiant of common-sense and of the counsellors which\nGod Himself accorded, I think that the Saints hold festival in heaven.\"\n\n\"A very pretty sermon,\" said the Queen. \"Yet I do not think that our\nGregory could very long endure a wife given over to such high-minded\ntalking. He prefers to hear himself do the fine talking.\"\n\nFollowed a silence, vexed only on the purposeless September winds; but I\nbelieve that neither of these two slept with profundity.\n\nAbout dawn one of the Queen's attendants roused Sir Gregory Darrell and\nconducted him into the hedged garden of Ordish, where Ysabeau walked in\ntranquil converse with Lord Berners. The old man was in high good-humor.\n\n\"My lad,\" said he, and clapped Sir Gregory upon the shoulder, \"you have,\nI do protest, the very phoenix of sisters. I was never happier.\" And he\nwent away chuckling.\n\nThe Queen said in a toneless voice, \"We ride for Blackfriars now.\"\n\nDarrell responded, \"I am content, and ask but leave to speak, briefly,\nwith Dame Rosamund before I die.\"\n\nThen the woman came more near to him. \"I am not used to beg, but within\nthis hour you encounter death, and I have loved no man in all my life\nsaving only you, Sir Gregory Darrell. Nor have you loved any person as\nyou loved me once in France. Oh, to-day, I may speak freely, for with\nyou the doings of that boy and girl are matters overpast. Yet were it\notherwise--eh, weigh the matter carefully! for I am mistress of England\nnow, and England would I give you, and such love as that slim, white\ninnocence has never dreamed of would I give you, Gregory Darrell--No,\nno! ah, Mother of God, not you!\" The Queen clapped one hand upon his\nlips.\n\n\"Listen,\" she quickly said; \"I spoke to tempt you. But you saw, and you\nsaw clearly, that it was the sickly whim of a wanton, and you never\ndreamed of yielding, for you love this Rosamund Eastney, and you know me\nto be vile. Then have a care of me! The strange woman am I, of whom we\nread that her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of\ndeath. Hoh, many strong men have been slain by me, and in the gray time\nto come will many others be slain by me, it may be; but never you among\nthem, my Gregory, who are more wary, and more merciful, and who know\nthat I have need to lay aside at least one comfortable thought against\neternity.\"\n\n\"I concede you to have been unwise--\" he hoarsely began.\n\nAbout them fell the dying leaves, of many glorious colors, but the air\nof this new day seemed raw and chill.\n\nThen Rosamund came through the opening in the hedge. \"Now, choose,\" she\nsaid; \"the woman offers life and high place and wealth, and it may be, a\ngreater love than I am capable of giving you. I offer a dishonorable\ndeath within the moment.\"\n\nAnd again, with that peculiar and imperious gesture, the man flung back\nhis head, and he laughed. Said Gregory Darrell:\n\n\"I am I! and I will so to live that I may face without shame not only\nGod, but also my own scrutiny.\" He wheeled upon the Queen and spoke\nhenceforward very leisurely. \"I love you; all my life long I have loved\nyou, Ysabeau, and even now I love you: and you, too, dear Rosamund, I\nlove, though with a difference. And every fibre of my being lusts for\nthe power that you would give me, Ysabeau, and for the good which I\nwould do with it in the England which I or blustering Roger Mortimer\nmust rule; as every fibre of my being lusts for the man that I would be\ncould I choose death without debate. And I think also of the man that\nyou would make of me, my Rosamund.\n\n\"The man! And what is this man, this Gregory Darrell, that his welfare\nshould be considered?--an ape who chatters to himself of kinship with\nthe archangels while filthily he digs for groundnuts! This much I know,\nat bottom.\n\n\"Yet more clearly do I perceive that this same man, like all his\nfellows, is a maimed god who walks the world dependent upon many wise\nand evil counsellors. He must measure, to a hair's-breadth, every\ncontent of the world by means of a bloodied sponge, tucked somewhere in\nhis skull, a sponge which is ungeared by the first cup of wine and\nruined by the touch of his own finger. He must appraise all that he\njudges with no better instruments than two bits of colored jelly, with a\nbungling makeshift so maladroit that the nearest horologer's apprentice\ncould have devised a more accurate device. In fine, each man is under\npenalty condemned to compute eternity with false weights, to estimate\ninfinity with a yard-stick: and he very often does it, and chooses his\nown death without debate. For though, 'If then I do that which I would\nnot I consent unto the law,' saith even an Apostle; yet a braver Pagan\nanswers him, 'Perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better\nand more divine than the things which cause the various effects and, as\nit were, pull thee by the strings.'\n\n\"There lies the choice which every man must face,--whether rationally,\nas his reason goes, to accept his own limitations and make the best of\nhis allotted prison-yard? or stupendously to play the fool and swear\neven to himself (while his own judgment shrieks and proves a flat\ndenial), that he is at will omnipotent? You have chosen long ago, my\npoor proud Ysabeau; and I choose now, and differently: for poltroon that\nI am! being now in a cold drench of terror, I steadfastly protest I am\nnot very much afraid, and I choose death without any more debate.\"\n\nIt was toward Rosamund that the Queen looked, and smiled a little\npitifully. \"Should Queen Ysabeau be angry or vexed or very cruel now, my\nRosamund? for at bottom she is glad.\"\n\nAnd the Queen said also: \"I give you back your plighted word. I ride\nhomeward to my husks, but you remain. Or rather, the Countess of\nFarrington departs for the convent of Ambresbury, disconsolate in her\nwidowhood and desirous to have done with worldly affairs. It is most\nnatural she should relinquish to her beloved and only brother all her\ndower-lands--or so at least Messire de Berners acknowledges. Here, then,\nis the grant, my Gregory, that conveys to you those lands of Ralph de\nBelomys which last year I confiscated. And this tedious Messire de\nBerners is willing now--he is eager to have you for a son-in-law.\"\n\nAbout them fell the dying leaves, of many glorious colors, but the air\nof this new day seemed raw and chill, while, very calmly, Dame Ysabeau\ntook Sir Gregory's hand and laid it upon the hand of Rosamund Eastney.\n\"Our paladin is, in the outcome, a mortal man, and therefore I do not\naltogether envy you. Yet he has his moments, and you are capable. Serve,\nthen, not only his desires but mine also, dear Rosamund.\"\n\nThere was a silence. The girl spoke as though it was a sacrament. \"I\nwill, madame and Queen.\"\n\nThus did the Queen end her holiday.\n\nA little later the Countess of Farrington rode from Ordish with all her\ntrain save one; and riding from that place, where love was, she sang\nvery softly.\n\nSang Ysabeau:\n\n  \"As with her dupes dealt Circe\n  Life deals with hers, for she\n  Reshapes them without mercy,\n  And shapes them swinishly,\n  To wallow swinishly,\n  And for eternity;\n\n  \"Though, harder than the witch was,\n  Life, changing not the whole,\n  Transmutes the body, which was\n  Proud garment of the soul,\n  And briefly drugs the soul,\n  Whose ruin is her goal;\n\n  \"And means by this thereafter\n  A subtler mirth to get,\n  And mock with bitterer laughter\n  Her helpless dupes' regret,\n  Their swinish dull regret\n  For what they half forget.\"\n\n\nAnd within the hour came Hubert Frayne to Ordish, on a foam-specked\nhorse, as he rode to announce to the King's men the King's barbaric\nmurder overnight, at Berkeley Castle, by Queen Ysabeau's order.\n\n\"Ride southward,\" said Lord Berners, and panted as they buckled on his\ndisused armor; \"but harkee, Frayne! if you pass the Countess of\nFarrington's company, speak no syllable of your news, since it is not\nconvenient that a lady so thoroughly and so praise-worthily--Lord, Lord,\nhow I have fattened!--so intent on holy things, in fine, should have her\nmeditations disturbed by any such unsettling tidings. Hey, son-in-law?\"\n\nSir Gregory Darrell laughed, very bitterly. \"He that is without blemish\namong you--\" he said. Then they armed completely, and went forth to\nbattle against the murderous harlot.\n\nTHE END OF THE FOURTH NOVEL\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 1: For this perplexing matter the curious may consult Paul\nVerville's _Notice sur la vie de Nicolas de Caen, p. 93 et seq_.

His profanity had its palliation. Heir to\nEngland though he was, you must know that this boy's father in the\nflesh had hounded him from England, as more recently had the lad's\nuncle Charles the Handsome driven him from France. Now had this boy\nand his mother (the same Queen Ysabeau about whom I have told you in\nthe preceding tale) come as suppliants to the court of that stalwart\nnobleman Sire William (Count of Hainault, Holland, and Zealand, and\nLord of Friesland), where their arrival had evoked the suggestion that\nthey depart at their earliest convenience. To-morrow, then, these\nfootsore royalties, the Queen of England and the Prince of Wales,\nwould be thrust out-of-doors to resume the weary beggarship, to knock\nagain upon the obdurate gates of this unsympathizing king or that deaf\nemperor.\n\nAccordingly the boy aspersed his destiny. At hand a nightingale\ncarolled as though an exiled prince were the blithest spectacle the\nmoon knew.\n\nThere came through the garden a tall girl, running, stumbling in her\nhaste. \"Hail, King of England!\" she said.\n\n\"Do not mock me, Philippa!\" the boy half-sobbed. Sulkily he rose to\nhis feet.\n\n\"No mockery here, my fair sweet friend. No, I have told my father all\nwhich happened yesterday. I pleaded for you. He questioned me very\nclosely. And when I had ended, he stroked his beard, and presently\nstruck one hand upon the table. 'Out of the mouth of babes!' he said.\nThen he said: 'My dear, I believe for certain that this lady and her\nson have been driven from their kingdom wrongfully. If it be for the\ngood of God to comfort the afflicted, how much more is it commendable\nto help and succor one who is the daughter of a king, descended from\nroyal lineage, and to whose blood we ourselves are related!' And\naccordingly he and your mother have their heads together yonder,\nplanning an invasion of England, no less, and the dethronement of your\nwicked father, my Edward. And accordingly--hail, King of England!\" The\ngirl clapped her hands gleefully. The nightingale sang.\n\nBut the boy kept momentary silence. Not even in youth were the men of\nhis race handicapped by excessively tender hearts; yesterday in the\nshrubbery the boy had kissed this daughter of Count William, in part\nbecause she was a healthy and handsome person, and partly because\ngreat benefit might come of an alliance with her father. Well! the\nPrince had found chance-taking not unfortunate. With the episode as\nfoundation, Count William had already builded up the future queenship\nof England. The strong Count could do--and, as it seemed, was now in\ntrain to do--indomitable deeds to serve his son-in-law; and now the\nbeggar of five minutes since foresaw himself, with this girl's love as\nladder, mounting to the high habitations of the King of England, the\nLord of Ireland, and the Duke of Aquitaine. Thus they would herald\nhim.\n\nSo he embraced the girl. \"Hail, Queen of England!\" said the Prince;\nand then, \"If I forget--\" His voice broke awkwardly. \"My dear, if ever\nI forget--!\" Their lips met now. The nightingale discoursed as if on a\nwager.\n\nPresently was mingled with the bird's descant another kind of singing.\nBeyond the yew-hedge as these two stood silent, breast to breast,\npassed young Jehan Kuypelant, one of the pages, fitting to the\naccompaniment of a lute his paraphrase of the song which Archilochus\nof Sicyon very anciently made in honor of Venus Melaenis, the tender\nVenus of the Dark.\n\nAt a gap in the hedge the young Brabanter paused. His singing ended,\ngulped. These two, who stood heart hammering against heart, saw for an\ninstant Jehan Kuypelant's lean face silvered by the moonlight, his\nmouth a tiny abyss. Followed the beat of lessening footfalls, while\nthe nightingale improvised an envoi.\n\nBut earlier Jehan Kuypelant also had sung, as though in rivalry with\nthe bird.\n\nSang Jehan Kuypelant:\n\n  \"Hearken and heed, Melaenis!\n  For all that the litany ceased\n  When Time had pilfered the victim,\n  And flouted thy pale-lipped priest,\n  And set astir in the temple\n  Where burned the fires of thy shrine\n  The owls and wolves of the desert--\n  Yet hearken, (the issue is thine!)\n  And let the heart of Atys,\n  At last, at last, be mine!\n\n  \"For I have followed, nor faltered--\n  Adrift in a land of dreams\n  Where laughter and pity and terror\n  Commingle as confluent streams,\n  I have seen and adored the Sidonian,\n  Implacable, fair and divine--\n  And bending low, have implored thee\n  To hearken, (the issue is thine!)\n  And let the heart of Atys,\n  At last, at last, be mine!\"\n\nIt is time, however, that we quit this subject and speak of other\nmatters. Just twenty years later, on one August day in the year of\ngrace 1346, Master John Copeland--as men now called Jehan Kuypelant,\nnow secretary to the Queen of England,--brought his mistress the\nunhandsome tidings that David Bruce had invaded her realm with forty\nthousand Scots to back him. The Brabanter found plump Queen Philippa\nwith the kingdom's arbitress--Dame Catherine de Salisbury, whom King\nEdward, third of that name to reign in Britain, and now warring in\nFrance, very notoriously adored and obeyed.\n\nThis king, indeed, had been despatched into France chiefly, they\nnarrate, to release the Countess' husband, William de Montacute, from\nthe French prison of the Ch\u00e2telet. You may appraise her dominion by\nthis fact: chaste and shrewd, she had denied all to King Edward, and\nin consequence he could deny her nothing; so she sent him to fetch\nback her husband, whom she almost loved. That armament had sailed from\nSouthampton on Saint George's day.\n\nThese two women, then, shared the Brabanter's execrable news. Already\nNorthumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham were the broken meats of King\nDavid.\n\nThe Countess presently exclaimed: \"Let them weep for this that must!\nMy place is not here.\"\n\nPhilippa said, half hopefully, \"Do you forsake Sire Edward,\nCatherine?\"\n\n\"Madame and Queen,\" the Countess answered, \"in this world every man\nmust scratch his own back. My lord has entrusted to me his castle of\nWark, his fiefs in Northumberland. These, I hear, are being laid\nwaste. Were there a thousand men-at-arms left in England I would say\nfight. As it is, our men are yonder in France and the island is\ndefenceless. Accordingly I ride for the north to make what terms I may\nwith the King of Scots.\"\n\nNow you might have seen the Queen's eye brighten. \"Undoubtedly,\" said\nshe, \"in her lord's absence it is the wife's part to defend his\nbelongings. And my lord's fief is England. I bid you God-speed,\nCatherine.\" And when the Countess was gone, Philippa turned, her round\nface somewhat dazed and flushed. \"She betrays him! she compounds with\nthe Scot! Mother of Christ, let me not fail!\"\n\n\"A ship must be despatched to bid Sire Edward return,\" said the\nsecretary. \"Otherwise all England is lost.\"\n\n\"Not so, John Copeland! We must let Sire Edward complete his\noverrunning of France, if such be the Trinity's will. You know\nperfectly well that he has always had a fancy to conquer France; and\nif I bade him return now he would be vexed.\"\n\n\"The disappointment of the King,\" John Copeland considered, \"is a\nsmaller evil than allowing all of us to be butchered.\"\n\n\"Not to me, John Copeland,\" the Queen said.\n\nNow came many lords into the chamber, seeking Madame Philippa. \"We\nmust make peace with the Scottish rascal!--England is lost!--A ship\nmust be sent entreating succor of Sire Edward!\" So they shouted.\n\n\"Messieurs,\" said Queen Philippa, \"who commands here? Am I, then, some\nwoman of the town?\"\n\nEnsued a sudden silence. John Copeland, standing by the seaward\nwindow, had picked up a lute and was fingering the instrument\nhalf-idly. Now the Marquess of Hastings stepped from the throng.\n\"Pardon, Highness. But the occasion is urgent.\"\n\n\"The occasion is very urgent, my lord,\" the Queen assented, deep in\nmeditation.\n\nJohn Copeland flung back his head and without prelude began to carol\nlustily.\n\nSang John Copeland:\n\n  \"There are taller lads than Atys,\n  And many are wiser than he,--\n  How should I heed them?--whose fate is\n  Ever to serve and to be\n  Ever the lover of Atys,\n  And die that Atys may dine,\n  Live if he need me--Then heed me,\n  And speed me, (the moment is thine!)\n  And let the heart of Atys,\n  At last, at last, be mine!\n\n  \"Fair is the form unbeholden,\n  And golden the glory of thee\n  Whose voice is the voice of a vision\n  Whose face is the foam of the sea,\n  And the fall of whose feet is the flutter\n  Of breezes in birches and pine,\n  When thou drawest near me, to hear me,\n  And cheer me, (the moment is thine!)\n  And let the heart of Atys,\n  At last, at last, be mine!\"\n\n\nI must tell you that the Queen shivered, as if with extreme cold. She\ngazed toward John Copeland wonderingly. The secretary was fretting at\nhis lutestrings, with his head downcast. Then in a while the Queen\nturned to Hastings.\n\n\"The occasion is very urgent, my lord,\" the Queen assented. \"Therefore\nit is my will that to-morrow one and all your men be mustered at\nBlackheath. We will take the field without delay against the King of\nScots.\"\n\nThe riot began anew. \"Madness!\" they shouted; \"lunar madness! We can\ndo nothing until our King returns with our army!\"\n\n\"In his absence,\" the Queen said, \"I command here.\"\n\n\"You are not Regent,\" the Marquess answered. Then he cried, \"This is\nthe Regent's affair!\"\n\n\"Let the Regent be fetched,\" Dame Philippa said, very quietly. They\nbrought in her son, Messire Lionel, now a boy of eight years, and, in\nthe King's absence, Regent of England.\n\nBoth the Queen and the Marquess held papers. \"Highness,\" Lord Hastings\nbegan, \"for reasons of state which I lack time to explain, this\ndocument requires your signature. It is an order that a ship be\ndespatched to ask the King's return. Your Highness may remember the\npony you admired yesterday?\" The Marquess smiled ingratiatingly. \"Just\nhere, your Highness--a crossmark.\"\n\n\"The dappled one?\" said the Regent; \"and all for making a little\nmark?\" The boy jumped for the pen.\n\n\"Lionel,\" said the Queen, \"you are Regent of England, but you are also\nmy son. If you sign that paper you will beyond doubt get the pony, but\nyou will not, I think, care to ride him. You will not care to sit down\nat all, Lionel.\"\n\nThe Regent considered. \"Thank you very much, my lord,\" he said in the\nultimate, \"but I do not like ponies any more. Do I sign here, Mother?\"\n\nPhilippa handed the Marquess a subscribed order to muster the English\nforces at Blackheath; then another, closing the English ports. \"My\nlords,\" the Queen said, \"this boy is the King's vicar. In defying him,\nyou defy the King. Yes, Lionel, you have fairly earned a pot of jam\nfor supper.\"\n\nThen Hastings went away without speaking. That night assembled at his\nlodgings, by appointment, Viscount Heringaud, Adam Frere, the Marquess\nof Orme, Lord Stourton, the Earls of Neville and Gage, and Sir Thomas\nRokeby. These seven found a long table there littered with pens and\nparchment; to the rear of it, with a lackey behind him, sat the\nMarquess of Hastings, meditative over a cup of Bordeaux.\n\nPresently Hastings said: \"My friends, in creating our womankind the\nMaker of us all was beyond doubt actuated by laudable and cogent\nreasons; so that I can merely lament my inability to fathom these\nreasons. I shall obey the Queen faithfully, since if I did otherwise\nSire Edward would have my head off within a day of his return. In\nconsequence, I do not consider it convenient to oppose his vicar.\nTo-morrow I shall assemble the tatters of troops which remain to us,\nand to-morrow we march northward to inevitable defeat. To-night I am\nsending a courier into Northumberland. He is an obliging person, and\nwould convey--to cite an instance--eight letters quite as blithely as\none.\"\n\nEach man glanced furtively about. England was in a panic by this, and\nknew itself to lie before the Bruce defenceless. The all-powerful\nCountess of Salisbury had compounded with King David; now Hastings,\ntoo, their generalissimo, compounded. What the devil! loyalty was a\nsonorous word, and so was patriotism, but, after all, one had estates\nin the north.\n\nThe seven wrote in silence. I must tell you that when they had ended,\nHastings gathered the letters into a heap, and without glancing at the\nsuperscriptures, handed all these letters to the attendant lackey.\n\"For the courier,\" he said.\n\nThe fellow left the apartment. Presently you heard a departing clatter\nof hoofs, and Hastings rose. He was a gaunt, terrible old man,\ngray-bearded, and having high eyebrows that twitched and jerked.\n\n\"We have saved our precious skins,\" said he. \"Hey, you fidgeters, you\nferments of sour offal! I commend your common-sense, messieurs, and I\nrequest you to withdraw. Even a damned rogue such as I has need of a\ncleaner atmosphere in order to breathe comfortably.\" The seven went\naway without further speech.\n\nThey narrate that next day the troops marched for Durham, where the\nQueen took up her quarters. The Bruce had pillaged and burned his way\nto a place called Beaurepair, within three miles of the city. He sent\nword to the Queen that if her men were willing to come forth from the\ntown he would abide and give them battle.\n\nShe replied that she accepted his offer, and that the barons would\ngladly risk their lives for the realm of their lord the King. The\nBruce grinned and kept silence, since he had in his pocket letters\nfrom most of them protesting they would do nothing of the sort.\n\nHere is comedy. On one side you have a horde of half-naked savages, a\nshrewd master holding them in leash till the moment be auspicious; on\nthe other, a housewife at the head of a tiny force lieutenanted by\nperjurers, by men already purchased. God knows what dreams she had of\nmiraculous victories, while her barons trafficked in secret with the\nBruce. It is recorded that, on the Saturday before Michaelmas, when\nthe opposing armies marshalled in the Bishop's Park, at Auckland, not\na captain on either side believed the day to be pregnant with battle.\nThere would be a decent counterfeit of resistance; afterward the\nlittle English army would vanish pell-mell, and the Bruce would be\nmaster of the island. The farce was prearranged, the actors therein\nwere letter-perfect.\n\nThat morning at daybreak John Copeland came to the Queen's tent, and\ninformed her quite explicitly how matters stood. He had been drinking\novernight with Adam Frere and the Earl of Gage, and after the third\nbottle had found them candid. \"Madame and Queen, we are betrayed. The\nMarquess of Hastings, our commander, is inexplicably smitten with a\nfever. He will not fight to-day. Not one of your lords will fight\nto-day.\" Master Copeland laid bare such part of the scheme as\nyesterday's conviviality had made familiar. \"Therefore I counsel\nretreat. Let the King be summoned out of France.\"\n\nQueen Philippa shook her head, as she cut up squares of toast and\ndipped them in milk for the Regent's breakfast. \"Sire Edward would be\nvexed. He has always wanted to conquer France. I shall visit the\nMarquess as soon as Lionel is fed,--do you know, John Copeland, I am\nanxious about Lionel; he is irritable and coughed five times during\nthe night,--and then I will attend to this affair.\"\n\nShe found the Marquess in bed, groaning, the coverlet pulled up to his\nchin. \"Pardon, Highness,\" said Lord Hastings, \"but I am an ill man. I\ncannot rise from this couch.\"\n\n\"I do not question the gravity of your disorder,\" the Queen retorted,\n\"since it is well known that the same illness brought about the death\nof Iscariot. Nevertheless, I bid you get up and lead our troops\nagainst the Scot.\"\n\nNow the hand of the Marquess veiled his countenance. \"I am an ill\nman,\" he muttered, doggedly. \"I cannot rise from this couch.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"My lord,\" the Queen presently began, \"without is an army\nprepared--yes, and quite able--to defend our England. The one\nrequirement of this army is a leader. Afford them that, my lord--ah, I\nknow that our peers are sold to the Bruce, yet our yeomen at least are\nhonest. Give them, then, a leader, and they cannot but conquer, since\nGod also is honest and incorruptible. Pardieu! a woman might lead\nthese men, and lead them to victory!\"\n\nHastings answered: \"I am ill. I cannot rise from this couch.\"\n\n\"There is no man left in England,\" said the Queen, \"since Sire Edward\nwent into France. Praise God, I am his wife!\" She went away without\nflurry.\n\nThrough the tent-flap Hastings beheld all that which followed. The\nEnglish force was marshalled in four divisions, each commanded by a\nbishop and a baron. You could see the men fidgeting, puzzled by the\ndelay; as a wind goes about a corn-field, vague rumors were going\nabout those wavering spears. Toward them rode Philippa, upon a white\npalfrey, alone and perfectly tranquil. Her eight lieutenants were now\ngathered about her in voluble protestation, and she heard them out.\nAfterward she spoke, without any particular violence, as one might\norder a strange cur from his room. Then the Queen rode on, as though\nthese eight declaiming persons had ceased to be of interest. She\nreined up before her standard-bearer, and took the standard in her\nhand. She began again to speak, and immediately the army was in an\nuproar; the barons were clustering behind her, in stealthy groups of\ntwo or three whisperers each; all were in the greatest amazement and\nknew not what to do; but the army was shouting the Queen's name.\n\n\"Now is England shamed,\" said Hastings, \"since a woman alone dares to\nencounter the Scot. She will lead them into battle--and by God! there\nis no braver person under heaven than yonder Dutch Frau! Friend David,\nI perceive that your venture is lost, for those men would follow her\nto storm hell if she desired it.\"\n\nHe meditated, and shrugged. \"And so would I,\" said Hastings.\n\nA little afterward a gaunt and haggard old man, bareheaded and very\nhastily dressed, reined his horse by the Queen's side. \"Madame and\nQueen,\" said Hastings, \"I rejoice that my recent illness is departed.\nI shall, by God's grace, on this day drive the Bruce from England.\"\n\nPhilippa was not given to verbiage. Doubtless she had her emotions,\nbut none was visible upon the honest face. She rested one plump hand\nupon the big-veined hand of Hastings. That was all. \"I welcome back\nthe gallant gentleman of yesterday. I was about to lead your army, my\nfriend, since there was no one else to do it, but I was hideously\nafraid. At bottom every woman is a coward.\"\n\n\"You were afraid to do it,\" said the Marquess, \"but you were going to\ndo it, because there was no one else to do it! Ho, madame! had I an\narmy of such cowards I would drive the Scot not past the Border but\nbeyond the Orkneys.\"\n\nThe Queen then said, \"But you are unarmed.\"\n\n\"Highness,\" he replied, \"it is surely apparent that I, who have played\nthe traitor to two monarchs within the same day, cannot with either\ndecency or comfort survive that day.\" He turned upon the lords and\nbishops twittering about his horse's tail. \"You merchandise, get back\nto your stations, and if there was ever an honest woman in any of your\nfamilies, the which I doubt, contrive to get yourselves killed this\nday, as I mean to do, in the cause of the honestest and bravest woman\nour time has known.\" Immediately the English forces marched toward\nMerrington.\n\nPhilippa returned to her pavilion and inquired for John Copeland. She\nwas informed that he had ridden off, armed, in company with five of\nher immediate retainers. She considered this strange, but made no\ncomment.\n\nYou picture her, perhaps, as spending the morning in prayer, in\nbeatings upon her breast, and in lamentations. Philippa did nothing of\nthe sort. She considered her cause to be so clamantly just that to\nexpatiate to the Holy Father upon its merits would be an impertinence;\nit was not conceivable that He would fail her; and in any event, she\nhad in hand a deal of sewing which required immediate attention.\nAccordingly she settled down to her needlework, while the Regent of\nEngland leaned his head against her knee, and his mother told him that\nageless tale of Lord Huon, who in a wood near Babylon encountered the\nKing of Fa\u00ebry, and subsequently bereaved an atrocious Emir of his\nbeard and daughter. All this the industrious woman narrated in a low\nand pleasant voice, while the wide-eyed Regent attended and at the\nproper intervals gulped his cough-mixture.\n\nYou must know that about noon Master John Copeland came into the tent.\n\"We have conquered,\" he said. \"Now, by the Face!\"--thus, scoffingly,\nhe used her husband's favorite oath,--\"now, by the Face! there was\nnever a victory more complete! The Scottish army is fled, it is as\nutterly dispersed from man's seeing as are the sands which dried the\nletters King Ahasuerus gave the admirable Esther!\"\n\n\"I rejoice,\" the Queen said, looking up from her sewing, \"that we have\nconquered, though in nature I expected nothing else--Oh, horrible!\"\nShe sprang to her feet with a cry of anguish. Here in little you have\nthe entire woman; the victory of her armament was to her a thing of\ncourse, since her cause was just, whereas the loss of two front teeth\nby John Copeland was a calamity.\n\nHe drew her toward the tent-flap, which he opened. Without was a\nmounted knight, in full panoply, his arms bound behind him, surrounded\nby the Queen's five retainers. \"In the rout I took him,\" said John\nCopeland; \"though, as my mouth witnesses, I did not find this David\nBruce a tractable prisoner.\"\n\n\"Is that, then, the King of Scots?\" Philippa demanded, as she mixed\nsalt and water for a mouthwash. \"Sire Edward should be pleased, I\nthink. Will he not love me a little now, John Copeland?\"\n\nJohn Copeland lifted both plump hands toward his lips. \"He could not\nchoose,\" John Copeland said; \"madame, he could no more choose but love\nyou than I could choose.\"\n\nPhilippa sighed. Afterward she bade John Copeland rinse his gums and\nthen take his prisoner to Hastings. He told her the Marquess was dead,\nslain by the Knight of Liddesdale. \"That is a pity,\" the Queen said.\nShe reflected a while, reached her decision. \"There is left alive in\nEngland but one man to whom I dare entrust the keeping of the King of\nScots. My barons are sold to him; if I retain Messire David by me, one\nor another lord will engineer his escape within the week, and Sire\nEdward will be vexed. Yet listen, John--\" She unfolded her plan.\n\n\"I have long known,\" he said, when she had done, \"that in all the\nworld there was no lady more lovable. Twenty years I have loved you,\nmy Queen, and yet it is only to-day I perceive that in all the world\nthere is no lady more wise than you.\"\n\nPhilippa touched his cheek, maternally. \"Foolish boy! You tell me the\nKing of Scots has an arrow-wound in his nose? I think a bread poultice\nwould be best.\" She told him how to make this poultice, and gave other\ninstructions. Then John Copeland left the tent and presently rode away\nwith his company.\n\nPhilippa saw that the Regent had his dinner, and afterward mounted her\nwhite palfrey and set out for the battle-field. There the Earl of\nNeville, as second in command, received her with great courtesy. God\nhad shown to her Majesty's servants most singular favor: despite the\ncalculations of reasonable men,--to which, she might remember, he had\nthat morning taken the liberty to assent,--some fifteen thousand Scots\nwere slain. True, her gallant general was no longer extant, though\nthis was scarcely astounding when one considered the fact that he had\nvoluntarily entered the m\u00eal\u00e9e quite unarmed. A touch of age, perhaps;\nHastings was always an eccentric man: in any event, as epilogue, this\nNeville congratulated the Queen that--by blind luck, he was forced to\nconcede,--her worthy secretary had made a prisoner of the Scottish\nKing. Doubtless, Master Copeland was an estimable scribe, and yet--Ah,\nyes, Lord Neville quite followed her Majesty--beyond doubt, the\nwardage of a king was an honor not lightly to be conferred. Oh, yes,\nhe understood; her Majesty desired that the office should be given\nsome person of rank. And pardie! her Majesty was in the right. Eh?\nsaid the Earl of Neville.\n\nIntently gazing into the man's shallow eyes, Philippa assented. Master\nCopeland had acted unwarrantably in riding off with his captive. Let\nhim be sought at once. She dictated to Neville's secretary a letter,\nwhich informed John Copeland that he had done what was not agreeable\nin purloining her prisoner. Let him without delay deliver the King to\nher good friend the Earl of Neville.\n\nTo Neville this was satisfactory, since he intended that once in his\npossession David Bruce should escape forthwith. The letter, I repeat,\nsuited this smirking gentleman in its tiniest syllable, and the single\ndifficulty was to convey it to John Copeland, for as to his\nwhereabouts neither Neville nor any one else had the least notion.\n\nThis was immaterial, however, for they narrate that next day a letter\nsigned with John Copeland's name was found pinned to the front of\nNeville's tent. I cite a passage therefrom: \"I will not give up my\nroyal prisoner to a woman or a child, but only to my own lord, Sire\nEdward, for to him I have sworn allegiance, and not to any woman. Yet\nyou may tell the Queen she may depend on my taking excellent care of\nKing David. I have poulticed his nose, as she directed.\"\n\nHere was a nonplus, not without its comical side. Two great realms had\nmet in battle, and the king of one of them had vanished like a\nsoap-bubble. Philippa was in a rage,--you could see that both by her\ndemeanor and by the indignant letters she dictated; true, none of\nthese letters could be delivered, since they were all addressed to\nJohn Copeland. Meanwhile, Scotland was in despair, whereas the traitor\nEnglish barons were in a frenzy, because they did not know what had\nbecome of their fatal letters to the Bruce, or of him either. The\ncircumstances were unique, and they remained unchanged for three\nfeverish weeks.\n\nWe will now return to affairs in France, where on the day of the\nNativity, as night gathered about Calais, John Copeland came\nunheralded to the quarters of King Edward, then besieging that city.\nMaster Copeland entreated audience, and got it readily enough, since\nthere was no man alive whom Sire Edward more cordially desired to lay\nhis fingers upon.\n\nA page brought Master Copeland to the King, that stupendous, blond and\nincredibly big person. With Sire Edward were that careful Italian,\nAlmerigo di Pavia, who afterward betrayed Sire Edward, and a lean\nsoldier whom Master Copeland recognized as John Chandos. These three\nwere drawing up an account of the recent victory at Cr\u00e9\u00e7i, to be\nforwarded to all mayors and sheriffs in England, with a cogent\npostscript as to the King's incidental and immediate need of money.\n\nNow King Edward sat leaning far back in his chair, a hand on either\nhip, and with his eyes narrowing as he regarded Master Copeland. Had\nthe Brabanter flinched, the King would probably have hanged him within\nthe next ten minutes; finding his gaze unwavering, the King was\npleased. Here was a novelty; most people blinked quite honestly under\nthe scrutiny of those fierce big eyes, which were blue and cold and of\nan astounding lustre. The lid of the left eye drooped a little: this\nwas Count Manuel's legacy, they whispered.\n\nThe King rose with a jerk and took John Copeland's hand. \"Ha!\" he\ngrunted, \"I welcome the squire who by his valor has captured the King\nof Scots. And now, my man, what have you done with Davie?\"\n\nJohn Copeland answered: \"Highness, you may find him at your\nconvenience safely locked in Bamborough Castle. Meanwhile, I entreat\nyou, sire, do not take it amiss if I did not surrender King David to\nthe orders of my lady Queen, for I hold my lands of you, and not of\nher, and my oath is to you, and not to her, unless indeed by choice.\"\n\n\"John,\" the King sternly replied, \"the loyal service you have done us\nis considerable, whereas your excuse for kidnapping Davie is a farce.\nHey, Almerigo, do you and Chandos avoid the chamber! I have something\nin private with this fellow.\" When they had gone, the King sat down\nand composedly said, \"Now tell me the truth, John Copeland.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" Copeland began, \"it is necessary you first understand I bear a\nletter from Madame Philippa--\"\n\n\"Then read it,\" said the King. \"Heart of God! have I an eternity to\nwaste on you slow-dealing Brabanters!\"\n\nJohn Copeland read aloud, while the King trifled with a pen, half\nnegligent, and in part attendant.\n\nRead John Copeland:\n\n\"My DEAR LORD,--_recommend me to your lordship with soul and body and\nall my poor might, and with all this I thank you, as my dear lord,\ndearest and best beloved of all earthly lords I protest to me, and\nthank you, my dear lord, with all this as I say before. Your\ncomfortable letter came to me on Saint Gregory's day, and I was never\nso glad as when I heard by your letter that ye were strong enough in\nPonthieu by the grace of God for to keep you from your enemies. Among\nthem I estimate Madame Catherine de Salisbury, who would have betrayed\nyou to the Scot. And, dear lord, if it be pleasing to your high\nlordship that as soon as ye may that I might hear of your gracious\nspeed, which may God Almighty continue and increase, I shall be glad,\nand also if ye do continue each night to chafe your feet with a rag of\nwoollen stuff, as your physician directed. And, my dear lord, if it\nlike you for to know of my fare, John Copeland will acquaint you\nconcerning the Bruce his capture, and the syrup he brings for our son\nLord Edward's cough, and the great malice-workers in these shires\nwhich would have so despitefully wrought to you, and of the manner of\ntaking it after each meal. I am lately informed that Madame Catherine\nis now at Stirling with Robert Stewart and has lost all her good looks\nthrough a fever. God is invariably gracious to His servants. Farewell,\nmy dear lord, and may the Holy Trinity keep you from your adversaries\nand ever send me comfortable tidings of you. Written at York, in the\nCastle, on Saint Gregory's day last past, by your own poor_\n\n\"PHILIPPA.\n\n_\"To my true lord.\"_\n\n\"H'm!\" said the King; \"and now give me the entire story.\"\n\nJohn Copeland obeyed. I must tell you that early in the narrative King\nEdward arose and strode toward a window. \"Catherine!\" he said. He\nremained motionless while Master Copeland went on without any manifest\nemotion. When he had ended, King Edward said, \"And where is Madame de\nSalisbury now?\"\n\nAt this the Brabanter went mad. As a leopard springs he leaped upon\nthe King, and grasping him by each shoulder, shook that monarch as one\npunishing a child.\n\n\"Now by the splendor of God--!\" King Edward began, very terrible in\nhis wrath. He saw that John Copeland held a dagger to his breast, and\nhe shrugged. \"Well, my man, you perceive I am defenceless.\"\n\n\"First you will hear me out,\" John Copeland said.\n\n\"It would appear,\" the King retorted, \"that I have little choice.\"\n\nAt this time John Copeland began: \"Sire, you are the mightiest monarch\nyour race has known. England is yours, France is yours, conquered\nScotland lies prostrate at your feet. To-day there is no other man in\nall the world who possesses a tithe of your glory; yet twenty years\nago Madame Philippa first beheld you and loved you, an outcast, an\nexiled, empty-pocketed prince. Twenty years ago the love of Madame\nPhilippa, great Count William's daughter, got for you the armament\nwith which England was regained. Twenty years ago but for Madame\nPhilippa you had died naked in some ditch.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" the King said presently.\n\n\"Afterward you took a fancy to reign in France. You learned then that\nwe Brabanters are a frugal people: Madame Philippa was wealthy when\nshe married you, and twenty years had quadrupled her private fortune.\nShe gave you every penny of it that you might fit out this expedition;\nnow her very crown is in pawn at Ghent. In fine, the love of Madame\nPhilippa gave you France as lightly as one might bestow a toy upon a\nchild who whined for it.\"\n\nThe King fiercely said, \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Eh, sire, I intend to. You left England undefended that you might\nposture a little in the eyes of Europe. And meanwhile a woman\npreserves England, a woman gives you Scotland as a gift, and in return\nasks nothing--God have mercy on us!--save that you nightly chafe your\nfeet with a bit of woollen. You hear of it--and inquire, '_Where is\nMadame de Salisbury?_' Here beyond doubt is the cock of Aesop's\nfable,\" snarled John Copeland, \"who unearthed a gem and grumbled that\nhis diamond was not a grain of corn.\"\n\n\"You shall be hanged at dawn,\" the King replied. \"Meanwhile spit out\nyour venom.\"\n\n\"I say to you, then,\" John Copeland continued, \"that to-day you are\nmaster of Europe. I say to you that, but for this woman whom for\ntwenty years you have neglected, you would to-day be mouldering in some\npauper's grave. Eh, without question, you most magnanimously loved\nthat shrew of Salisbury! because you fancied the color of her eyes,\nSire Edward, and admired the angle between her nose and her forehead.\nMinstrels unborn will sing of this great love of yours. Meantime I say\nto you\"--now the man's rage was monstrous--\"I say to you, go home to\nyour too-tedious wife, the source of all your glory! sit at her feet!\nand let her teach you what love is!\" He flung away the dagger. \"There\nyou have the truth. Now summon your attendants, my tr\u00e8s beau sire, and\nhave me hanged.\"\n\nThe King made no movement. \"You have been bold--\" he said at last.\n\n\"But you have been far bolder, sire. For twenty years you have dared\nto flout that love which is God's noblest heritage to His children.\"\n\nKing Edward sat in meditation for a long while. The squinting of his\nleft eye was now very noticeable. \"I consider my wife's clerk,\" he\ndrily said, \"to discourse of love in somewhat too much the tone of a\nlover.\" And a flush was his reward.\n\nBut when this Copeland spoke he was like one transfigured. His voice\nwas grave and very tender, and he said:\n\n\"As the fish have their life in the waters, so I have and always shall\nhave mine in love. Love made me choose and dare to emulate a lady,\nlong ago, through whom I live contented, without expecting any other\ngood. Her purity is so inestimable that I cannot say whether I derive\nmore pride or sorrow from its preeminence. She does not love me, and\nshe will never love me. She would condemn me to be hewed in fragments\nsooner than permit her husband's finger to be injured. Yet she\nsurpasses all others so utterly that I would rather hunger in her\npresence than enjoy from another all which a lover can devise.\"\n\nSire Edward stroked the table through this while, with an inverted\npen. He cleared his throat. He said, half-fretfully:\n\n\"Now, by the Face! it is not given every man to love precisely in this\ntroubadourish fashion. Even the most generous person cannot render to\nlove any more than that person happens to possess. I have read in an\nold tale how the devil sat upon a cathedral spire and white doves flew\nabout him. Monks came and told him to begone. 'Do not the spires show\nyou, O son of darkness' they clamored, 'that the place is holy?' And\nSatan (in this old tale) replied that these spires were capable of\nvarious interpretations. I speak of symbols, John. Yet I also have\nloved, in my own fashion,--and, it would seem, I win the same reward\nas you.\"\n\nThe King said more lately: \"And so she is at Stirling now? hobnob with\nmy armed enemies, and cajoling that red lecher Robert Stewart?\" He\nlaughed, not overpleasantly. \"Eh, yes, it needed a bold person to\nbring all your tidings! But you Brabanters are a very thorough-going\npeople.\"\n\nThe King rose and flung back his high head. \"John, the loyal service\nyou have done us and our esteem for your valor are so great that they\nmay well serve you as an excuse. May shame fall on those who bear you\nany ill-will! You will now return home, and take your prisoner, the\nKing of Scotland, and deliver him to my wife, to do with as she may\nelect. You will convey to her my entreaty--not my orders, John,--that\nshe come to me here at Calais. As remuneration for this evening's\ninsolence, I assign lands as near your house as you can choose them to\nthe value of \u00a3500 a year for you and for your heirs.\"\n\nYou must know that John Copeland fell upon his knees before King\nEdward. \"Sire--\" he stammered.\n\nBut the King raised him. \"No, no,\" he said, \"you are the better man.\nWere there any equity in fate, John Copeland, your lady had loved you,\nnot me. As it is, I must strive to prove not altogether unworthy of my\nfortune. But I make no large promises,\" he added, squinting horribly,\n\"because the most generous person cannot render to love any more than\nthat person happens to possess. So be off with you, John\nCopeland,--go, my squire, and bring me back my Queen!\"\n\nPresently he heard John Copeland singing without. And through that\ninstant, they say, his youth returned to Edward Plantagenet, and all\nthe scents and shadows and faint sounds of Valenciennes on that\nancient night when a tall girl came to him, running, stumbling in her\nhaste to bring him kingship. \"She waddles now,\" he thought forlornly.\n\"Still, I am blessed.\" But Copeland sang, and the Brabanter's heart\nwas big with joy.\n\nSang John Copeland:\n\n  \"Long I besought thee, nor vainly,\n  Daughter of Water and Air--\n  Charis! Idalia! Hortensis!\n  Hast thou not heard the prayer,\n  When the blood stood still with loving,\n  And the blood in me leapt like wine,\n  And I cried on thy name, Melaenis?--\n  That heard me, (the glory is thine!)\n  And let the heart of Atys,\n  At last, at last, be mine!\n\n  \"Falsely they tell of thy dying,\n  Thou that art older than Death,\n  And never the H\u00f6rselberg hid thee,\n  Whatever the slanderer saith,\n  For the stars are as heralds forerunning,\n  When laughter and love combine\n  At twilight, in thy light, Melaenis--\n  That heard me, (the glory is thine!)\n  And let the heart of Atys,\n  At last, at last, be mine!\"\n\n\nTHE END OF THE FIFTH NOVEL\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE STORY OF THE SATRAPS\n\n\n  \"Je suis voix au d\u00e9sert criant\n  Que chascun soyt rectifiant\n  La voye de Sauveur; non suis,\n  Et accomplir je ne le puis.\"\n\nTHE SIXTH NOVEL.--ANNE OF BOHEMIA HAS ONE SOLE FRIEND, AND BY HIM\nPLAYS THE FRIEND'S PART; AND IN DOING SO ACHIEVES THEIR COMMON\nANGUISH, AS WELL AS THE CONFUSION OF STATECRAFT AND THE POULTICING OF\nA GREAT DISEASE.\n\n\n\n\n_The Story of the Satraps_\n\n\nIn the year of grace 1381 (Nicolas begins) was Dame Anne magnificently\nfetched from remote Bohemia, and at Westminster married to Sire\nRichard, the second monarch of that name to reign in England. This\nking, I must tell you, had succeeded while he was yet an infant, to\nthe throne of his grandfather, the third King Edward, about whom I\nhave told you in the story preceding this.\n\nQueen Anne had presently noted a certain priest who went forbiddingly\nabout her court, where he was accorded a provisional courtesy, and who\nwent also into many hovels, where pitiable wrecks of humankind\nreceived his alms and ministrations.\n\nQueen Anne made inquiries. This young cleric was amanuensis to the\nDuke of Gloucester, she learned, and was notoriously a by-blow of the\nDuke's brother, dead Lionel of Clarence. She sent for this Edward\nMaudelain. When he came her first perception was, \"How wonderful is\nhis likeness to the King!\" while the thought's commentary ran,\nunacknowledged, \"Yes, as an eagle resembles a falcon!\" For here, to\nthe observant eye, was a more zealous person, already passion-wasted,\nand a far more dictatorial and stiff-necked person than the lazy and\namiable King; also, this Maudelain's face and nose were somewhat too\nlong and high: the priest was, in a word, the less comely of the pair\nby a very little, and to an immeasurable extent the more kinglike.\n\n\"You are my cousin now, messire,\" the Queen told him, and innocently\noffered to his lips her own.\n\nHe never moved; but their glances crossed, and for that instant she\nsaw the face of a man who has just stepped into a quicksand. She grew\nred, without knowing why. Then he spoke, composedly, of trivial\nmatters.\n\nThus began the Queen's acquaintance with Edward Maudelain. She was by\nthis time the loneliest woman in the island. Her husband granted her a\nbright and fresh perfection of form and color, but desiderated any\nappetizing tang, and lamented, in his phrase, a certain kinship to the\nimpeccable loveliness of some female saint in a jaunty tapestry;\nbright as ice in sunshine, just so her beauty chilled you, he\ncomplained: moreover, this daughter of the Caesars had been fetched\ninto England, chiefly, to breed him children, and this she had never\ndone. Undoubtedly he had made a bad bargain,--he was too easy-going,\npeople presumed upon it. His barons snatched their cue and esteemed\nDame Anne to be negligible; whereas the clergy, finding that she\nobstinately read the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue, under the\nirrelevant plea of not comprehending Latin, began to denounce her from\ntheir pulpits as a heretic and as the evil woman prophesied by\nEzekiel.\n\nIt was the nature of this desolate child to crave affection, as a\nnecessary, and pitifully she tried to purchase it through almsgiving.\nIn the attempt she could have found no coadjutor more ready than\nEdward Maudelain. Giving was with these two a sort of obsession,\nthough always he gave in a half scorn of his fellow creatures which\nwas not more than half concealed. This bastard was charitable and\npious because he knew his soul, conceived in double sin, to be doubly\nevil, and therefore doubly in need of redemption through good works.\n\nNow in and about the Queen's lonely rooms the woman and the priest met\ndaily to discuss now this or that point of theology, or now (to cite a\nsingle instance) Gammer Tudway's obstinate sciatica. Considerate\npersons found something of the pathetic in their preoccupation by\nthese matters while, so clamantly, the dissension between the young\nKing and his uncles gathered to a head. The King's uncles meant to\ncontinue governing England, with the King as their ward, as long as\nthey could; he meant to relieve himself of this guardianship, and them\nof their heads, as soon as he was able. War seemed inevitable, the air\nwas thick with portents; and was this, then, an appropriate time, the\njudicious demanded of high Heaven, for the Queen of imperilled England\nto concern herself about a peasant's toothache?\n\nLong afterward was Edward Maudelain to remember this quiet and amiable\nperiod of his life, and to wonder over the man that he had been\nthrough this queer while. Embittered and suspicious she had found him,\nnoted for the carping tongue he lacked both power and inclination to\nbridle; and she had, against his nature, made Maudelain see that every\nperson is at bottom lovable, and that human vices are but the stains\nof a traveller midway in a dusty journey; and had incited the priest\nno longer to do good for his soul's health, but simply for his\nfellow's benefit.\n\nIn place of that monstrous passion which had at first view of her\npossessed the priest, now, like a sheltered taper, glowed an adoration\nwhich made him yearn, in defiance of common-sense, to suffer somehow\nfor this beautiful and gracious comrade; though very often pity for\nher loneliness and knowledge that she dared trust no one save him\nwould throttle Maudelain like two assassins, and would move the\nhot-blooded young man to a rapture of self-contempt and exultation.\n\nNow Maudelain made excellent songs, it was a matter of common report.\nYet but once in their close friendship did the Queen command him to\nmake a song for her. This had been at Dover, about vespers, in the\nstarved and tiny garden overlooking the English Channel, upon which\nher apartments faced; and the priest had fingered his lute for an\nappreciable while before he sang, more harshly than was his custom.\n\nSang Maudelain:\n\n  \"Ave Maria! now cry we so\n  That see night wake and daylight go.\n\n  \"Mother and Maid, in nothing incomplete,\n  This night that gathers is more light and fleet\n  Than twilight trod alway with stumbling feet,\n  Agentes semper uno animo.\n\n  \"Ever we touch the prize we dare not take!\n  Ever we know that thirst we dare not slake!\n  Yet ever to a dreamed-of goal we make--\n  Est tui coeli in palatio!\n\n  \"Long, long the road, and set with many a snare;\n  And to how small sure knowledge are we heir\n  That blindly tread, with twilight everywhere!\n  Volo in toto; sed non valeo!\n\n  \"Long, long the road, and very frail are we\n  That may not lightly curb mortality,\n  Nor lightly tread together steadfastly,\n  Et parvum carmen unum facio:\n\n  \"Mater, ora filium,\n  Ut post hoc exilium\n  Nobis donet gaudium\n  Beatorum omnium!\"\n\nDame Anne had risen. She said nothing. She stayed in this posture for\na lengthy while, one hand yet clasping each breast. Then she laughed,\nand began to speak of Long Simon's recent fever. Was there no method\nof establishing him in another cottage? No, the priest said, the\npeasants, like the cattle, were always deeded with the land, and Simon\ncould not lawfully be taken away from his owner.\n\nOne day, about the hour of prime, in that season of the year when\nfields smell of young grass, the Duke of Gloucester sent for Edward\nMaudelain. The court was then at Windsor. The priest came quickly to\nhis patron. He found the Duke in company with the King's other uncle\nEdmund of York and bland Harry of Derby, who was John of Gaunt's\noldest son, and in consequence the King's cousin. Each was a proud and\nhandsome man: Derby alone (who was afterward King of England) had\ninherited the squint that distinguished this family. To-day Gloucester\nwas gnawing at his finger nails, big York seemed half-asleep, and the\nEarl of Derby appeared patiently to await something as yet ineffably\nremote.\n\n\"Sit down!\" snarled Gloucester. His lean and evil countenance was that\nof a tired devil. The priest obeyed, wondering that so high an honor\nshould be accorded him in the view of three great noblemen. Then\nGloucester said, in his sharp way: \"Edward, you know, as England\nknows, the King's intention toward us three and our adherents. It has\ncome to our demolishment or his. I confess a preference in the matter.\nI have consulted with the Pope concerning the advisability of taking\nthe crown into my own hands. Edmund here does not want it, and my\nbrother John is already achieving one in Spain. Eh, in imagination I\nwas already King of England, and I had dreamed--Well! to-day the\nprosaic courier arrived. Urban--the Neapolitan swine!--dares give me\nno assistance. It is decreed I shall never reign in these islands. And\nI had dreamed--Meanwhile, de Vere and de la Pole are at the King day\nand night, urging revolt. As matters go, within a week or two, the\nthree heads before you will be embellishing Temple Bar. You, of\ncourse, they will only hang.\"\n\n\"We must avoid England, then, my noble patron,\" the priest considered.\n\nAngrily the Duke struck a clenched fist upon the table. \"By the Cross!\nwe remain in England, you and I and all of us. Others avoid. The Pope\nand the Emperor will have none of me. They plead for the Black\nPrince's heir, for the legitimate heir. Dompnedex! they shall have\nhim!\"\n\nMaudelain recoiled, for he thought this twitching man insane.\n\n\"Besides, the King intends to take from me my fief at Sudbury,\" said\nthe Duke of York, \"in order to give it to de Vere. That is both absurd\nand monstrous and abominable.\"\n\nOpenly Gloucester sneered. \"Listen!\" he rapped out toward Maudelain;\n\"when they were drawing up the Great Peace at Br\u00e9tigny, it happened,\nas is notorious, that the Black Prince, my brother, wooed in this town\nthe Demoiselle Alixe Riczi, whom in the outcome he abducted. It is not\nso generally known, however, that, finding this sister of the Vicomte\nde Montbrison a girl of obdurate virtue, my brother had prefaced the\naction by marriage.\"\n\n\"And what have I to do with all this?\" said Edward Maudelain.\n\nGloucester retorted: \"More than you think. For this Alixe was conveyed\nto Chertsey, here in England, where at the year's end she died in\nchildbirth. A little before this time had Sir Thomas Holland seen his\nlast day,--the husband of that Joane of Kent whom throughout life my\nbrother loved most marvellously. The disposition of the late\nQueen-Mother is tolerably well known. I make no comment save that to\nher moulding my brother was as so much wax. In fine, the two lovers\nwere presently married, and their son reigns to-day in England. The\nabandoned son of Alixe Riczi was reared by the Cistercians at\nChertsey, where some years ago I found you.\"\n\nHe spoke with a stifled voice, wrenching forth each sentence; and now\nwith a stiff forefinger flipped a paper across the table. \"_In\nextremis_ my brother did more than confess. He signed,--your Majesty,\"\nsaid Gloucester. The Duke on a sudden flung out his hands, like a\nwizard whose necromancy fails, and the palms were bloodied where his\nnails had cut the flesh.\n\n\"Moreover, my daughter was born at Sudbury,\" said the Duke of York.\n\nAnd of Maudelain's face I cannot tell you. He made pretence to read\nthe paper carefully, but his eyes roved, and he knew that he stood\namong wolves. The room was oddly shaped, with eight equal sides: the\nceiling was of a light and brilliant blue, powdered with many golden\nstars, and the walls were hung with smart tapestries which\ncommemorated the exploits of Theseus. \"Then I am King,\" this Maudelain\nsaid aloud, \"of France and England, and Lord of Ireland, and Duke of\nAquitaine! I perceive that Heaven loves a jest.\" He wheeled upon\nGloucester and spoke with singular irrelevance, \"And what is to be\ndone with the present Queen?\"\n\nAgain the Duke shrugged. \"I had not thought of the dumb wench. We have\nmany convents.\"\n\nNow Maudelain twisted the paper between his long, wet fingers and\nappeared to meditate.\n\n\"It would be advisable, your Grace,\" observed the Earl of Derby,\nsuavely, and breaking his silence for the first time, \"that you\nyourself should wed Dame Anne, once the Apostolic See has granted the\nnecessary dispensation. Treading too close upon the fighting requisite\nto bring about the dethronement and death of our nominal lord the\nso-called King, a war with Bohemia, which would be only too apt to\nfollow this noble lady's assassination, would be highly inconvenient,\nand, lacking that, we would have to pay back her dowry.\"\n\nThen these three princes rose and knelt before the priest; they were\nclad in long bright garments, and they glittered with gold and many\njewels. He standing among them shuddered in his sombre robe. \"Hail,\nKing of England!\" cried these three.\n\n\"Hail, ye that are my kinsmen!\" he answered; \"hail, ye that spring of\nan accursed race, as I! And woe to England for that hour wherein\nManuel of Poictesme held traffic with the Sorceress of Provence, and\nthe devil's son begot an heir for England! Of ice and of lust and of\nhell-fire are all we sprung; old records attest it; and fickle and\ncold and ravenous and without shame are all our race until the end. Of\nyour brother's dishonor ye make merchandise to-day, and to-day\nfratricide whispers me, and leers, and, Heaven help me! I attend. O\nGod of Gods! wilt Thou dare bid a man live stainless, having aforetime\nfilled his veins with such a venom? Then haro, will I cry from Thy\ndeepest hell.... Oh, now let the adulterous Redeemer of Poictesme\nrejoice in his tall fires, to note that his descendants know of what\nwood to make a crutch! You are very wise, my kinsmen. Take your\nmeasures, messieurs who are my kinsmen! Though were I of any other\nrace, with what expedition would I now kill you, I that recognize\nwithin me the strength to do it! Then would I slay you! without any\nanimosity, would I slay you then, just as I would kill as many\nsplendid snakes!\"\n\nHe went away, laughing horribly. Gloucester drummed upon the table,\nhis brows contracted. But the lean Duke said nothing; big York seemed\nto drowse; and Henry of Derby smiled as he sounded a gong for that\nscribe who would draw up the necessary letters. The Earl's time was\nnot yet come, but it was nearing.\n\nIn the antechamber the priest encountered two men-at-arms dragging a\ndead body from the castle. The Duke of Kent, Maudelain was informed,\nhad taken a fancy to a peasant girl, and in remonstrance her misguided\nfather had actually tugged at his Grace's sleeve.\n\nMaudelain went into the park of Windsor, where he walked for a long\nwhile alone. It was a fine day in the middle spring; and now he seemed\nto understand for the first time how fair was his England. For all\nEngland was his fief, held in vassalage to God and to no man alive,\nhis heart now sang; allwhither his empire spread, opulent in grain and\nmetal and every revenue of the earth, and in stalwart men (his\nchattels), and in strong orderly cities, where the windows would be\nadorned with scarlet hangings, and women (with golden hair and red lax\nlips) would presently admire as King Edward rode slowly by at the head\nof a resplendent retinue. And always the King would bow, graciously\nand without haste, to his shouting people.... He laughed to find\nhimself already at rehearsal of the gesture.\n\nIt was strange, though, that in this glorious fief of his so many\npersons should, as yet, live day by day as cattle live, suspicious of\nall other moving things (with reason), and roused from their incurious\nand filthy apathy only when some glittering baron, like a resistless\neagle, swept uncomfortably near as he passed on some by-errand of the\nmore bright and windy upper-world. East and north they had gone\nyearly, for so many centuries, these dumb peasants, to fight out their\nmaster's uncomprehended quarrel, and to manure with their carcasses\nthe soil of France and of Scotland. Give these serfs a king, now, who\n(being absolute), might dare to deal in perfect equity with rich and\npoor, who with his advent would bring Peace into England as his bride,\nas Trygaeus did very anciently in Athens--\"And then,\" the priest\nparaphrased, \"may England recover all the blessings she has lost, and\neverywhere the glitter of active steel will cease.\" For everywhere men\nwould crack a rustic jest or two, unhurriedly. Virid fields would\nheave brownly under their ploughs; they would find that with practice\nit was almost as easy to chuckle as it was to cringe.\n\nMeanwhile on every side the nobles tyrannized in their degree, well\nclothed and nourished, but at bottom equally comfortless in condition.\nAs illuminate by lightning Maudelain saw the many factions of his\nbarons squabbling for gross pleasures, like wolves over a corpse, and\nblindly dealing death to one another to secure at least one more\ndelicious gulp before that inevitable mangling by the teeth of some\nburlier colleague. The complete misery of England showed before\nMaudelain like a winter landscape. The thing was questionless. He must\ntread henceforward without fear among frenzied beasts, and to their\nultimate welfare. On a sudden Maudelain knew himself to be invincible\nand fine, and hesitancy ebbed.\n\nTrue, Richard, poor fool, must die. Squarely the priest faced that\nstark and hideous circumstance; to spare Richard was beyond his power,\nand the boy was his brother; yes, this oncoming King Edward would be a\nfratricide, and after death would be irrevocably damned. To burn, and\neternally to burn, and, worst of all, to know that the torment was\neternal! ay, it would be hard; but, at the cost of Richard's ignoble\nlife and of Edward's inconsiderable soul, to win so many men to\nmanhood was not a bargain to be refused.\n\nThe tale tells that Maudelain went toward the little garden which\nadjoined Dame Anne's apartments. He found the Queen there, alone, as\nnowadays she was for the most part, and he paused to wonder at her\nbright and singular beauty. How vaguely odd was this beauty, he\nreflected, too; how alien in its effect to that of any other woman in\nsturdy England, and how associable it was, somehow, with every wild\nand gracious denizen of the woods which blossomed yonder.\n\nIn this place the world was all sunlight, temperate but undiluted.\nThey had met in a wide, unshaded plot of grass, too short to ripple,\nwhich everywhere glowed steadily, like a gem. Right and left, birds\nsang as if in a contest. The sky was cloudless, a faint and radiant\nblue throughout, save where the sun stayed as yet in the zenith, so\nthat the Queen's brows cast honey-colored shadows upon either cheek.\nThe priest was greatly troubled by the proud and heatless\nbrilliancies, the shrill joys, of every object within the radius of\nhis senses.\n\nShe was splendidly clothed, in a kirtle of very bright green, tinted\nlike the verdancy of young ferns in sunlight, and wore over all a gown\nof white, cut open on each side as far as the hips. This garment was\nembroidered with golden leopards and was trimmed with ermine. About\nher yellow hair was a chaplet of gold, wherein emeralds glowed. Her\nblue eyes were as large and shining and changeable (he thought) as two\noceans in midsummer; and Maudelain stood motionless and seemed to\nhimself but to revere, as the Earl Ixion did, some bright unstable\nwisp of cloud, while somehow all elation departed from him as water\ndoes from a wetted sponge compressed. He laughed discordantly.\n\n\"Wait--! O my only friend--!\" said Maudelain. Then in a level voice he\ntold her all, unhurriedly and without any apparent emotion.\n\nShe had breathed once, with a deep inhalation. She had screened her\ncountenance from his gaze the while you might have counted fifty.\nPresently she said: \"This means more war, for de Vere and Tressilian\nand de la Pole and Bramber and others of the barons know that the\nKing's fall signifies their ruin. Many thousands die to-morrow.\"\n\nHe answered, \"It means a war which will make me King of England, and\nwill make you my wife.\"\n\n\"In that war the nobles will ride abroad with banners and gay\nsurcoats, and will kill and ravish in the pauses of their songs; while\ndaily in that war the naked peasants will kill the one the other,\nwithout knowing why.\"\n\nHis thought had forerun hers. \"Yes, some must die, so that in the end\nI may be King, and the general happiness may rest at my disposal. The\nadventure of this world is wonderful, and it goes otherwise than under\nthe strict tutelage of reason.\"\n\n\"It would not be yours, but Gloucester's and his barons'. Friend, they\nwould set you on the throne to be their puppet and to move only as\nthey pulled the strings. Thwart them in their maraudings and they will\nfling you aside, as the barons have pulled down every king that dared\noppose them. No, they desire to live pleasantly, to have fish on\nFridays, and white bread and the finest wine the whole year through,\nand there is not enough for all, say they. Can you alone contend\nagainst them? and conquer them? for not unless you can do this may I\ndare bid you reign.\"\n\nThe sun had grown too bright, too merciless, but as always she drew\nthe truth from him. \"I could not venture to oppose in anything the\nbarons who supported my cause: for if I did, I would not endure a\nfortnight. Heaven help us, nor you nor I nor any one may transform\nthrough any personal force this bitter world, this piercing, cruel\nplace of frost and sun. Charity and Truth are excommunicate, and a\nking is only an adorned and fearful person who leads wolves toward\ntheir quarry, lest, lacking it, they turn and devour him. Everywhere\nthe powerful labor to put one another out of worship, and each to\nstand the higher with the other's corpse as his pedestal; and Lechery\nand Greed and Hatred sway these proud and inconsiderate fools as winds\nblow at will the gay leaves of autumn. We walk among shining vapors,\nwe aspire to overpass a mountain of unstable sparkling sand! We two\nalone in all the scuffling world! Oh, it is horrible, and I think that\nSatan plans the jest! We dream for a while of refashioning this bright\ndesolation, and know that we alone can do it! we are as demigods, you\nand I, in those gallant dreams! and at the end we can but poultice\nsome dirty rascal!\"\n\nThe Queen answered sadly: \"Once and only once did God tread this\ntangible world, for a very little while, and, look you, to what\ntrivial matters He devoted that brief space! Only to chat with\nfishermen, and to talk with light women, and to consort with rascals,\nand at last to die between two cutpurses, ignominiously! If Christ\nHimself achieved so little that seemed great and admirable, how should\nwe two hope to do any more?\"\n\nHe answered: \"It is true. Of anise and of cumin the Master gets His\ntithe--\" Maudelain broke off with a yapping laugh. \"Puf! Heaven is\nwiser than we. I am King of England. It is my heritage.\"\n\n\"It means war. Many will die, thousands will die, and to no betterment\nof affairs.\"\n\n\"I am King of England. I am Heaven's satrap here, and answerable to\nHeaven alone. It is my heritage.\" And now his large and cruel eyes\nwere aflame as he regarded her.\n\nAnd visibly beneath their glare the woman changed. \"My friend, must I\nnot love you any longer? You would be content with happiness? Then I\nam jealous of that happiness! for you are the one friend that I have\nhad, and so dear to me--Look you!\" she said, with a light, wistful\nlaugh, \"there have been times when I was afraid of everything you\ntouched, and I hated everything you looked at. I would not have you\nstained; I desired to pass my whole life between the four walls of\nsome dingy and eternal gaol, forever alone with you, lest you become\nlike other men. I would in that period have been the very bread you\neat, the least perfume which delights you, the clod you touch in\ncrushing it, and I have often loathed some pleasure I derived from\nlife because I might not transfer it to you undiminished. For I wanted\nsomehow to make you happy to my own anguish.... It was wicked, I\nsuppose, for the imagining of it made me happy, too.\"\n\nNow while he listened to this dear and tranquil speaking, Edward\nMaudelain's raised hands had fallen like so much lead, and remembering\nhis own nature, he longed for annihilation, before she had appraised\nhis vileness. He said:\n\n\"With reason Augustine crieth out against the lust of the eyes. 'For\npleasure seeketh objects beautiful, melodious, fragrant, savory, and\nsoft; but this disease those contrary as well, not for the sake of\nsuffering annoyance, but out of the lust of making trial of them!' Ah!\nah! too curiously I planned my own damnation, too presumptuously I had\nesteemed my soul a worthy scapegoat, and I had gilded my enormity with\nmany lies. Yet indeed, indeed, I had believed brave things, I had\nplanned a not ignoble bargain--! Ey, say, is it not laughable,\nmadame?--as my birth-right Heaven accords me a penny, and with that\nonly penny I must presently be seeking to bribe Heaven.\"\n\nThen he said: \"Yet are we indeed God's satraps, as but now I cried in\nmy vainglory, and we hold within our palms the destiny of many\npeoples. Depardieux! God is wiser than we are. Still, Satan offers no\nunhandsome bribes--bribes that are tangible and sure. For Satan, too,\nis wiser than we are.\"\n\nThey stood like effigies, lit by the broad, unsparing splendor of the\nmorning, but again their kindling eyes had met, and again the man\nshuddered. \"Decide! oh, decide very quickly, my only friend!\" he said,\n\"for throughout I am all filth!\"\n\nCloser she drew to him, and laid one hand upon each shoulder. \"O my\nonly friend!\" she breathed, with red lax lips which were very near to\nhis, \"through these six years I have ranked your friendship as the\nchief of all my honors! and I pray God with an entire heart that I may\ndie so soon as I have done what I must do to-day!\"\n\nNow Maudelain was trying to smile, but he could not quite manage it.\n\"God save King Richard!\" said the priest. \"For by the cowardice and\ngreed and ignorance of little men is Salomon himself confounded, and\nby them is Hercules lightly unhorsed. Were I Leviathan, whose bones\nwere long ago picked clean by pismires, I could perform nothing\nagainst the will of many human pismires. Therefore do you pronounce my\ndoom.\"\n\n\"O King,\" then said Dame Anne, \"I bid you go forever from the court\nand live forever a landless man, friendless, and without even any\nname. Otherwise, you can in no way escape being made an instrument to\nbring about the misery and death of many thousands. This doom I dare\nadjudge and to pronounce, because we are royal and God's satraps, you\nand I.\"\n\nTwice or thrice his dry lips moved before he spoke. He was aware of\ninnumerable birds that carolled with a piercing and intolerable\nsweetness. \"O Queen!\" he hoarsely said, \"O fellow satrap! Heaven has\nmany fiefs. A fair province is wasted and accords to Heaven no\nrevenue. So wastes beauty, and a shrewd wit, and an illimitable\ncharity, which of their pride go in fetters and achieve no increase.\nTo-day the young King junkets with his flatterers, and but rarely\nthinks of England. You have that beauty by which men are lightly\nconquered, and the mere sight of which may well cause a man's voice to\ntremble as my voice trembles now, and through desire of which--But I\ntread afield! Of that beauty you have made no profit. O daughter of\nthe Caesars, I bid you now gird either loin for an unlovely traffic.\nOld Legion must be fought with fire. True that the age is sick, true\nthat we may not cure, we can but salve the hurt--\" His hand had torn\nopen his sombre gown, and the man's bared breast shone in the\nsunlight, and on his breast heaved sleek and glittering beads of\nsweat. Twice he cried the Queen's name. In a while he said: \"I bid you\nweave incessantly such snares of brain and body as may lure King\nRichard to be swayed by you, until against his will you daily guide\nthis shallow-hearted fool to some commendable action. I bid you live\nas other folk do hereabouts. Coax! beg! cheat! wheedle! lie!\" he\nbarked like a teased dog, \"and play the prostitute for him that wears\nmy crown, till you achieve in part the task which is denied me. This\ndoom I dare adjudge and to pronounce, because we are royal and God's\nsatraps, you and I.\"\n\nShe answered with a tiny, wordless sound. But presently, \"I take my\ndoom,\" the Queen proudly said. \"I shall be lonely now, my only friend,\nand yet--it does not matter,\" the Queen said, with a little shiver.\n\"No, nothing will ever greatly matter now, I think, now that I may not\never see you any more, my dearest.\"\n\nHer eyes had filled with tears; she was unhappy, and, as always, this\nknowledge roused in Maudelain a sort of frenzied pity and a hatred,\nquite illogical, of all other things existent. She was unhappy, that\nonly he comprehended: and for her to be made unhappy was unjust.\n\nSo he stood thus for an appreciable silence, staying motionless save\nthat behind his back his fingers were bruising one another. Everywhere\nwas this or that bright color and an incessant melody. It was\nunbearable. Then it was over; the ordered progress of all happenings\nwas apparent, simple, and natural; and contentment came into his heart\nlike a flight of linnets over level fields at dawn. He left her, and\nas he went he sang.\n\nSang Maudelain:\n\n  \"Christ save us all, as well He can,\n  A solis ortus cardine!\n  For He is both God and man,\n  Qui natus est de virgine,\n  And we but part of His wide plan\n  That sing, and heartily sing we,\n  'Gloria Tibi, Domine!'\n\n  \"Between a heifer and an ass\n  Enixa est puerpera;\n  In ragged woollen clad He was\n  Qui r\u00e9gn\u00e2t super aethera,\n  And patiently may we then pass\n  That sing, and heartily sing we,\n  'Gloria Tibi, Domine!'\"\n\nThe Queen shivered in the glad sunlight. \"I am, it must be, pitiably\nweak,\" she said at last, \"because I cannot sing as he does. And, since\nI am not very wise, were he to return even now--But he will not\nreturn. He will never return,\" the Queen repeated, carefully. \"It is\nstrange I cannot comprehend that he will never return! Ah, Mother of\nGod!\" she cried, with a steadier voice, \"grant that I may weep! nay,\nof thy infinite mercy let me presently find the heart to weep!\" And\nabout the Queen of England many birds sang joyously.\n\nShe sent for the King that evening, after supper, and they may well\nhave talked of many matters, for he did not return to his own\napartments that night. Next day the English barons held a council, and\nin the midst of it King Richard demanded to be told his age.\n\n\"Your Grace is in your twenty-second year,\" said the uneasy\nGloucester, who was now with reason troubled, since he had been vainly\nseeking everywhere for the evanished Maudelain.\n\n\"Then I have been under tutors and governors longer than any other\nward in my dominion. My lords, I thank you for your past services, but\nI need them no more.\" They had no check handy, and Gloucester in\nparticular foreread his death-warrant, but of necessity he shouted\nwith the others, \"Hail, King of England!\"\n\nThat afternoon the King's assumption of all royal responsibility was\ncommemorated by a tournament, over which Dame Anne presided. Sixty of\nher ladies led as many knights by silver chains into the\ntilting-grounds at Smithfield, and it was remarked that the Queen\nappeared unusually mirthful. The King was in high good humor, a\npattern of conjugal devotion; and the royal pair retired at dusk to\nthe Bishop of London's palace at Saint Paul's, where was held a merry\nbanquet, with dancing both before and after supper.\n\nTHE END OF THE SIXTH NOVEL\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE STORY OF THE HERITAGE\n\n\n  \"Pour vous je suis en prison mise,\n  En ceste chambre \u00e0 voulte grise,\n  Et traineray ma triste vie\n  Sans que jamais mon cueur varie,\n  Car toujours seray vostre amye.\"\n\nTHE SEVENTH NOVEL.--ISABEL OF VALOIS, BEING FORSAKEN BY ALL OTHERS, IS\nBEFRIENDED BY A PRIEST, WHO IN CHIEF THROUGH A CHILD'S INNOCENCE,\nCONTRIVES AND EXECUTES A LAUDABLE IMPOSTURE, AND WINS THEREBY TO\nDEATH.\n\n\n\n\n_The Story of the Heritage_\n\n\nIn the year of grace 1399 (Nicolas begins) dwelt in a hut near Caer\nDathyl in Arvon, as he had dwelt for some five years, a gaunt hermit,\nnotoriously consecrate, whom neighboring Welshmen revered as the\nBlessed Evrawc. There had been a time when people called him Edward\nMaudelain, but this period he dared not often remember.\n\nFor though in macerations of the flesh, in fasting, and in hour-long\nprayers he spent his days, this holy man was much troubled by devils.\nHe got little rest because of them. Sometimes would come into his hut\nBelphegor in the likeness of a butler, and whisper, \"Sire, had you\nbeen King, as was your right, you had drunk to-day not water but the\nwines of Spain and Hungary.\" Or Asmodeus saying, \"Sire, had you been\nKing, as was your right, you had lain now not upon the bare earth but\non cushions of silk.\"\n\nOne day in early spring, they say, the spirit called Orvendile sent\nthe likeness of a fair woman with yellow hair and large blue eyes. She\nwore a massive crown which seemed too heavy for her frailness to\nsustain. Soft tranquil eyes had lifted from her book. \"You are my\ncousin now, messire,\" this phantom had appeared to say.\n\nThat was the worst, and Maudelain began to fear he was a little mad\nbecause even this he had resisted with many aves.\n\nThere came also to his hut, through a sullen snowstorm, upon the\nafternoon of All Soul's day, a horseman in a long cloak of black. He\ntethered his black horse and he came noiselessly through the doorway\nof the hut, and upon his breast and shoulders the snow was white as\nthe bleached bones of those women that died in Merlin's youth.\n\n\"Greetings in God's name, Messire Edward Maudelain,\" the stranger\nsaid.\n\nSince the new-comer spoke intrepidly of holy things a cheerier\nMaudelain knew that this at least was no demon. \"Greetings!\" he\nanswered. \"But I am Evrawc. You name a man long dead.\"\n\n\"But it is from a certain Bohemian woman I come. What matter, then, if\nthe dead receive me?\" And thus speaking, the stranger dropped his\ncloak.\n\nHe was clad, as you now saw, in flame-colored satin, which shimmered\nwith each movement like a high flame. He had the appearance of a tall,\nlean youngster, with crisp, curling, very dark red hair. He now\nregarded Maudelain. He displayed peculiarly wide-set brown eyes; and\ntheir gaze was tender, and the tears somehow had come to Maudelain's\neyes because of his great love for this tall stranger. \"Eh, from the\ndead to the dead I travel, as ever,\" said the new-comer, \"with a\nmessage and a token. My message runs, _Time is, O fellow satrap!_ and\nmy token is this.\"\n\nIn this packet, wrapped with white parchment and tied with a golden\ncord, was only a lock of hair. It lay like a little yellow serpent in\nMaudelain's palm. \"And yet five years ago,\" he mused, \"this hair was\nturned to dust. God keep us all!\" Then he saw the tall lean emissary\npuffed out like a candle-flame; and upon the floor he saw the huddled\ncloak waver and spread like ink, and he saw the white parchment slowly\ndwindle, as snow melts under the open sun. But in his hand remained\nthe lock of yellow hair.\n\n\"O my only friend,\" said Maudelain, \"I may not comprehend, but I know\nthat by no unhallowed art have you won back to me.\" Hair by hair he\nscattered upon the floor that which he held. \"_Time is!_ and I have\nnot need of any token to spur my memory.\" He prized up a corner of the\nhearthstone, took out a small leather bag, and that day purchased a\nhorse and a sword.\n\nAt dawn the Blessed Evrawc rode eastward in secular apparel. Two weeks\nlater he came to Sunninghill; and it happened that the same morning\nthe Earl of Salisbury, who had excellent reason to consider ...\n\n_Follows a lacuna of fourteen pages. Maudelain's successful imposture\nof his half-brother, Richard the Second, so strangely favored by their\nphysical resemblance, and the subsequent fiasco at Circencester, are\nnow, however, tolerably well known to students of history._\n\n_In one way or another, Maudelain contrived to take the place of his\nnow dethroned brother, and therewith also the punishment designed for\nRichard. It would seem evident, from the Argument of the story in\nhand, that Nicolas de Caen attributes a large part of this mysterious\nbusiness to the co-operancy of Isabel of Valois, King Richard's eleven\nyear old wife. And (should one have a taste for the deductive) the\nforegoing name of Orvendile, when compared with \"THE STORY OF THE\nSCABBARD,\" would certainly hint that Owain Glyndwyr had a finger in\nthe affair._\n\n_It is impossible to divine by what method, according to Nicolas, this\nEdward Maudelain was substituted for his younger brother. Nicolas, if\nyou are to believe his \"EPILOGUE,\" had the best of reasons for knowing\nthat the prisoner locked up in Pontefract Castle in the February of\n1400, after Harry of Derby had seized the crown of England, was not\nRichard Plantagenet: as is attested, also, by the remaining fragment\nof this same_ \"STORY OF THE HERITAGE.\"\n\n... and eight men-at-arms followed him.\n\nQuickly Maudelain rose from the table, pushing his tall chair aside,\nand as he did this, one of the soldiers closed the door securely.\n\"Nay, eat your fill, Sire Richard,\" said Piers Exton, \"since you will\nnot ever eat again.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" the trapped man answered quietly. \"Then indeed you come in\na good hour.\" Once only he smote upon his breast. \"_Mea culpa!_ O\nEternal Father, do Thou shrive me very quickly of all those sins I\nhave committed, both in thought and deed, for now the time is very\nshort.\"\n\nAnd Exton spat upon the dusty floor. \"Foh, they had told me I would\nfind a king here. I discover only a cat that whines.\"\n\n\"Then 'ware his claws!\" As a viper leaps Maudelain sprang upon the\nnearest fellow and wrested away his halberd. \"Then 'ware his claws, my\nmen! For I come of an accursed race. And now let some of you lament\nthat hour wherein the devil's son begot an heir for England! For of\nice and of lust and of hell-fire are all we sprung; old records attest\nit; and fickle and cold and ravenous and without fear are all our race\nuntil the end. Hah, until the end! O God of Gods!\" this Maudelain\ncried, with a great voice, \"wilt Thou dare bid a man die patiently,\nhaving aforetime filled his veins with such a venom? For I lack the\ngrace to die as all Thy saints have died, without one carnal blow\nstruck in my own defence. I lack the grace, my Father, for even at the\nlast the devil's blood You gave me is not quelled. I dare atone for\nthat old sin done by my father in the flesh, but yet I must atone as\nbefits the race of Oriander!\"\n\nThen it was he and not they who pressed to the attack. Their meeting\nwas a bloody business, for in that dark and crowded room Maudelain\nraged among his nine antagonists like an angered lion among wolves.\n\nThey struck at random and cursed shrilly, for they were now\nhalf-afraid of this prey they had entrapped; so that presently he was\nall hacked and bleeding, though as yet he had no mortal wound. Four of\nthese men he had killed by this time, and Piers Exton also lay at his\nfeet.\n\nThen the other four drew back a little. \"Are ye tired so soon?\" said\nMaudelain, and he laughed terribly. \"What, even you! Why, look ye, my\nbold veterans, I never killed before to-day, and I am not breathed as\nyet.\"\n\nThus he boasted, exultant in his strength. But the other men saw that\nbehind him Piers Exton had crawled into the chair from which (they\nthought) King Richard had just risen, and they saw Exton standing\nerect in this chair, with both arms raised. They saw this Exton strike\nthe King with his pole-axe, from behind, once only, and they knew no\nmore was needed.\n\n\"By God!\" said one of them in the ensuing stillness, and it was he who\nbled the most, \"that was a felon's blow.\"\n\nBut the dying man who lay before them made as though to smile. \"I\ncharge you all to witness,\" he faintly said, \"how willingly I render\nto Caesar's daughter that which was ever hers.\"\n\nThen Exton fretted, as if with a little trace of shame: \"Who would\nhave thought the rascal had remembered that first wife of his so long?\nCaesar's daughter, saith he! and dares in extremis to pervert Holy\nScripture like any Wycliffite! Well, he is as dead as that first\nCaesar now, and our gracious King, I think, will sleep the better for\nit. And yet--God only knows! for they are an odd race, even as he\nsaid--these men that have old Manuel's blood in them.\"\n\nTHE END OF THE SEVENTH NOVEL\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nTHE STORY OF THE SCABBARD\n\n\n  \"Ainsi il avait trouv\u00e9 sa mie\n  Si belle qu'on put souhaiter.\n  N'avoit cure d'ailleurs plaider,\n  Fors qu'avec lui manoir et estre.\n  Bien est Amour puissant et maistre.\"\n\nTHE EIGHTH NOVEL.--BRANWEN OF WALES GETS A KING'S LOVE UNWITTINGLY,\nAND IN ALL INNOCENCE CONVINCES HIM OF THE LITTLENESS OF HIS KINGDOM;\nSO THAT HE BESIEGES AND IN DUE COURSE OCCUPIES ANOTHER REALM AS YET\nUNMAPPED.\n\n\n\n\n_The Story of the Scabbard_\n\n\nIn the year of grace 1400 (Nicolas begins) King Richard, the second\nmonarch of that name to rule in England, wrenched his own existence,\nand nothing more, from the close wiles of his cousin, Harry of Derby,\nwho was now sometimes called Henry of Lancaster, and sometimes\nBolingbroke. The circumstances of this evasion having been recorded in\nthe preceding tale, it suffices here to record that this Henry was\npresently crowned King of England in Richard's place. All persons,\nsaving only Owain Glyndwyr and Henry of Lancaster, believed King\nRichard dead at that period when Richard attended his own funeral, as\na proceeding taking to the fancy, and, among many others, saw the body\nof Edward Maudelain interred with every regal ceremony in the chapel\nat Langley Bower. Then alone Sire Richard crossed the seas, and at\nthirty-three set out to inspect a transformed and gratefully\nuntrammelling world wherein not a foot of land belonged to him.\n\nHolland was the surname he assumed, the name of his half-brothers; and\nto detail his Asian wanderings would be tedious and unprofitable. But\nat the end of each four months would come to him a certain messenger\nfrom Glyndwyr, supposed by Richard to be the imp Orvendile, who\nnotoriously ran every day around the world upon the Welshman's\nbusiness. It was in the Isle of Taprobane, where the pismires are as\ngreat as hounds, and mine and store the gold of which the inhabitants\nafterward rob them through a very cunning device, that this emissary\nbrought the letter which read simply, \"Now is England fit pasture for\nthe White Hart.\" Presently Richard Holland was in Wales, and then he\nrode to Sycharth.\n\nThere, after salutation, Glyndwyr gave an account of his long\nstewardship. It was a puzzling record of obscure and tireless\nmachinations with which we have no immediate concern: in brief, the\nbarons who had ousted King Log had been the very first to find their\nsquinting King Stork intolerable; and Northumberland, Worcester,\nDouglas, Mortimer, and so on, were already pledged and in open revolt.\n\"By the God I do not altogether serve,\" Owain ended, \"you have but to\ndeclare yourself, sire, and within the moment England is yours.\"\n\nRichard spoke with narrowed eyes. \"You forget that while Henry of\nLancaster lives no other man can ever hope to reign tranquilly in\nthese islands. Come then! the hour strikes; and we will coax the devil\nfor once in a way to serve God.\"\n\n\"Oh, but there is a boundary appointed,\" Glyndwyr moodily returned.\n\"You, too, forget that in cold blood this Henry stabbed my best-loved\nson. But I do not forget this, and I have tried divers methods which\nwe need not speak of,--I who can at will corrupt the air, and cause\nsickness and storms, raise heavy mists, and create plagues and fires\nand shipwrecks; yet the life itself I cannot take. For there is a\nboundary appointed, sire, and beyond that frontier the Master of our\nSabbaths cannot serve us even though he would.\"\n\nRichard crossed himself. \"You horribly mistake my meaning. Your\npractices are your own affair, and in them I decline to dabble. I\nmerely design to trap a tiger with his appropriate bait. For you have\na fief at Caer Idion, I think?--Very well! I intend to herd your sheep\nthere, for a week or two, after the honorable example of Apollo. It is\nyour part to see that Henry knows I am living disguised and\ndefenceless at Caer Idion.\"\n\nThe gaunt Welshman chuckled. \"Yes, squinting Henry of Lancaster would\ncross the world, much less the Severn, to make quite sure of Richard's\ndeath. He would come in his own person with at most some twenty\ntrustworthy followers. I will have a hundred there; and certain aging\nscores will then be settled in that place.\" Glyndwyr meditated\nafterward, very evilly. \"Sire,\" he said without prelude, \"I do not\nrecognize Richard of Bordeaux. You have garnered much in travelling!\"\n\n\"Why, look you,\" Richard returned, \"I have garnered so much that I do\nnot greatly care whether this scheme succeed or no. With age I begin\nto contend even more indomitably that a wise man will consider nothing\nvery seriously. You barons here believe it an affair of importance who\nmay chance to be the King of England, say, this time next year; you\ntake sides between Henry and me. I tell you frankly that neither of\nus, that no man in the world, by reason of innate limitations, can\never rule otherwise than abominably, or, ruling, can create anything\nsave discord. Nor can I see how this matters either, since the\ndiscomfort of an ant-village is not, after all, a planet-wrecking\ndisaster. No, Owain, if the planets do indeed sing together, it is,\ndepend upon it, to the burden of _Fools All_. For I am as liberally\nendowed as most people; and when I consider my abilities, my\nperformances, my instincts, and so on, quite aloofly, as I would\nappraise those of another person, I can only shrug: and to conceive\nthat common-sense, much less Omnipotence, would ever concern itself\nabout the actions of a creature so entirely futile is, to me at least,\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"I have known the thought,\" said Owain,--\"though rarely since I found\nthe Englishwoman that was afterward my wife, and never since my son,\nmy Gruffyd, was murdered by a jesting man. He was more like me than\nthe others, people said.... You are as yet the empty scabbard,\npowerless alike for help or hurt. Ey, hate or love must be the sword,\nsire, that informs us here, and then, if only for a little while, we\nare as gods.\"\n\n\"Pardie! I have loved as often as Salomon, and in fourteen kingdoms.\"\n\n\"We of Cymry have a saying, sire, that when a man loves par amours the\nsecond time he may safely assume that he has never been in love at\nall.\"\n\n\"--And I hate Henry of Lancaster as I do the devil.\"\n\n\"I greatly fear,\" said Owain with a sigh, \"lest it may be your\nirreparable malady to hate nothing, not even that which you dislike.\nNo, you consider things with both eyes open, with an unmanly\nrationality: whereas Sire Henry views all matters with that heroic\nsquint which came into your family from Poictesme.\"\n\n\"Be off with your dusty scandals!\" said Richard, laughing.\n\nSo then Glyndwyr rode south to besiege and burn the town of Caerdyf,\nwhile at Caer Idion Richard Holland abode tranquilly for some three\nweeks. There was in this place only Caradawc (the former shepherd),\nhis wife Alundyne, and their sole daughter Branwen. They gladly\nperceived Sire Richard was no more a peasant than he was a curmudgeon;\nas Caradawc observed: \"It is perfectly apparent that the robe of\nPadarn Beisrudd, which refuses to adjust itself to any save highborn\npersons, would fit him as a glove does the hand; but we will ask no\nquestions, since it is not wholesome to dispute the orderings of Owain\nGlyndwyr.\"\n\nNow day by day would Richard Holland drive the flocks to pasture near\nthe Severn, and loll there in the shade, and make songs to his lute.\nHe grew to love this leisured life of bright and open spaces; and its\nlong solitudes, grateful with the warm odors of growing things and\nwith poignant bird-noises; and the tranquillity of these meadows, that\nwere always void of hurry, bedrugged the man through many fruitless\nand contented hours.\n\nEach day at noon Branwen would bring his dinner, and she would\nsometimes chat with him while he ate. After supper he would discourse\nto Branwen of remote kingdoms, through which, as aimlessly as a wind\nveers, he had ridden at adventure, among sedate and alien peoples who\nadjudged him a madman; and she, in turn, would tell him curious tales\nfrom the _Red Book of Hergest_,--telling of Gwalchmai, and Peredur,\nand Geraint, in each one of which fine heroes she had presently\ndiscerned an inadequate forerunnership of Richard's existence.\n\nThis Branwen was a fair wench, slender and hardy. She had the bold\ndemeanor of a child who is ignorant of evil and in consequence of\nsuspicion. Happily, though, had she been named for that unhappy lady\nof old, the wife of King Matholwch, for this Branwen, too, had a\nwhite, thin, wistful face, like that of an empress on a silver coin\nwhich is a little worn. Her eyes were large and brilliant, colored\nlike clear emeralds, and her abundant hair was so much cornfloss, only\nit was more brightly yellow and was of immeasurably finer texture. In\nfull sunlight her cheeks were frosted like the surface of a peach, but\nthe underlying cool pink of them was rather that of a cloud just after\nsunset, Richard decided. In all, a taking morsel! though her shapely\nhands were hard with labor, and she rarely laughed; for, as if in\nrecompense, her heart was tender, and she rarely ceased to smile as\nthough she were thinking of some peculiar and wonderful secret which\nshe intended, in due time, to share with you and with nobody else.\nBranwen had many lovers, and preferred among them young Gwyllem ap\nLlyr, a portly lad, who was handsome enough, though he had tiny and\npiggish eyes, and who sang divinely.\n\nOne day this Gwyllem came to Richard with two quarter-staves. \"Saxon,\"\nhe said, \"you appear a stout man. Take your pick of these, then, and\nhave at you.\"\n\n\"Such are not the weapons I would have named,\" Richard answered: \"yet\nin reason, Messire Gwyllem, I can deny you nothing that means nothing\nto me.\"\n\nWith that they laid aside their coats and fell to exercise. In these\nunaccustomed bouts Richard was soundly drubbed, as he had anticipated,\nbut he found himself the stronger man of the two, and he managed\nsomehow to avoid an absolute overthrow. By what method he contrived\nthis he never ascertained.\n\n\"I have forgotten what we are fighting about,\" he observed, after ten\nminutes of heroic thumps and hangings; \"or, to be perfectly exact, I\nnever knew. But we will fight no more in this place. Come and go with\nme to Welshpool, Messire Gwyllem, and there we will fight to a\nconclusion over good sack and claret.\"\n\n\"Content!\" cried Gwyllem; \"but only if you yield me Branwen.\"\n\n\"Have we indeed wasted a whole half-hour in squabbling over a woman?\"\nRichard demanded; \"like two children in a worldwide toyshop over any\none particular toy? Then devil take me if I am not heartily ashamed of\nmy folly! Though, look you, Gwyllem, I would speak naught save\ncommendation of these delicate and livelily-tinted creatures so long\nas one is able to approach them in a becoming spirit of levity: it is\nonly their not infrequent misuse which I would condemn; and in my\nopinion the person who elects to build a shrine for any one of them\nhas only himself to blame if his chosen goddess will accept no\nburnt-offering except his honor and happiness. Yet since time's youth\nhave many fine men been addicted to this insane practice, as, for\nexample, were Hercules and Merlin to their illimitable sorrow; and,\nindeed, the more I reconsider the old gallantries of Salomon, and of\nother venerable and sagacious potentates, the more profoundly am I\nashamed of my sex.\"\n\nGwyllem said: \"This lazy gabbling of yours is all very fine. Perhaps\nit is also reasonable. Only when you love you do not reason.\"\n\n\n\"I was endeavoring to prove that,\" said Richard gently. Then they went\nto Welshpool, ride and tie on Gwyllem's horse. Tongue loosened by the\nclaret, Gwyllem raved aloud of Branwen, like a babbling faun, while to\neach rapture Richard affably assented. In his heart he likened the boy\nto Dionysos at Naxos, and could find no blame for Ariadne. Moreover,\nthe room was comfortably dark and cool, for thick vines hung about the\nwindows, rustling and tapping pleasantly, and Richard was content.\n\n\"She does not love me?\" Gwyllem cried. \"It is well enough. I do not\ncome to her as one merchant to another, since love was never bartered.\nListen, Saxon!\" He caught up Richard's lute. The strings shrieked\nbeneath Gwyllem's fingers as he fashioned his rude song.\n\nSang Gwyllem:\n\n  \"Love me or love me not, it is enough\n  That I have loved you, seeing my whole life is\n  Uplifted and made glad by the glory of Love,--\n  My life that was a scroll bescrawled and blurred\n  With tavern-catches, which that pity of his\n  Erased, and wrote instead one lonely word,\n  O Branwen!\n\n  \"I have accorded you incessant praise\n  And song and service, dear, because of this;\n  And always I have dreamed incessantly\n  Who always dreamed, when in oncoming days\n  This man or that shall love you, and at last\n  This man or that shall win you, it must be\n  That, loving him, you will have pity on me\n  When happiness engenders memory\n  And long thoughts, nor unkindly, of the past,\n  O Branwen!\n\n  \"Of this I know not surely, who am sure\n  That I shall always love you while I live,\n  And that, when I am dead, with naught to give\n  Of song or service, Love will yet endure,\n  And yet retain his last prerogative,\n  When I lie still, and sleep out centuries,\n  With dreams of you and the exceeding love\n  I bore you, and am glad dreaming thereof,\n  And give God thanks for all, and so find peace,\n  O Branwen!\"\n\n\"Now, were I to get as tipsy as that,\" Richard enviously thought,\nmidway in a return to his stolid sheep, \"I would simply go to sleep\nand wake up with a headache. And were I to fall as many fathoms deep\nin love as this Gwyllem ventures, or, rather, as he hurls himself with\na splurge, I would perform--I wonder, now, what miracle?\"\n\nFor he was, though vaguely, discontent. This Gwyllem was so young, so\nearnest over every trifle, and above all, was so untroubled by\nforethought: each least desire controlled him, as varying winds sport\nwith a fallen leaf, whose frank submission to superior vagaries the\nboy appeared to emulate. Richard saw that in a fashion Gwyllem was\nsuperb. \"And heigho!\" said Richard, \"I am attestedly a greater fool\nthan he, but I begin to weary of a folly so thin-blooded.\"\n\nThe next morning came a ragged man, riding upon a mule. He declared\nhimself a tinker. He chatted out an hour with Richard, who perfectly\nrecognized him as Sir Walter Blount; and then this tinker crossed over\ninto England.\n\nRichard whistled. \"Now my cousin will be quite sure, and now my\nanxious cousin will come to speak with Richard of Bordeaux. And now,\nby every saint in the calendar! I am as good as King of England.\"\n\nHe sat down beneath a young oak and twisted four or five blades of\ngrass between his fingers while he meditated. Undoubtedly he would\nkill this squinting Henry of Lancaster with a clear conscience and\neven with a certain relish, much as one crushes the uglier sort of\nvermin, but, hand upon heart, Richard was unable to avow any\nparticularly ardent desire for the scoundrel's death. Thus crudely to\ndemolish the knave's adroit and year-long schemings savored actually\nof grossness. The spider was venomous, and his destruction laudable;\ngranted, but in crushing him you ruined his web, a miracle of patient\nmachination, which, despite yourself, compelled hearty admiring and\nenvy. True, the process would recrown a certain Richard, but then, as\nRichard recalled it, being King was rather tedious. Richard was not\nnow quite sure that he wanted to be King, and, in consequence, be\ndaily plagued by a host of vexatious and ever-squabbling barons. \"I\nshall miss the little huzzy, too,\" he thought.\n\n\"Heigho!\" said Richard, \"I shall console myself with purchasing all\nbeautiful things that can be touched and handled. Life is a flimsy\nvapor which passes and is not any more: presently Branwen will be\nmarried to this Gwyllem and will be grown fat and old, and I shall be\nremarried to little Dame Isabel, and shall be King of England: and a\ntrifle later all four of us shall be dead. Pending this deplorable\nconsummation a wise man will endeavor to amuse himself.\"\n\nNext day he despatched Caradawc to Owain Glyndwyr to bid the latter\nsend the promised implements to Caer Idion. Richard, returning to the\nhut the same evening, found Alundyne there, alone, and grovelling at\nthe threshold. Her forehead was bloodied when she raised it and\nthrough tearless sobs told of what had happened. A half-hour earlier,\nwhile she and Branwen were intent upon their milking, Gwyllem had\nridden up, somewhat the worse for liquor. Branwen had called him sot,\nhad bidden him go home. \"That I will do,\" said Gwyllem and suddenly\ncaught up the girl. Alundyne sprang for him, and with clenched fist\nGwyllem struck her twice full in the face, and laughing, rode away\nwith Branwen.\n\nRichard made no observation. In silence he fetched his horse, and did\nnot pause to saddle it. Quickly he rode to Gwyllem's house, and broke\nin the door. Against the farther wall stood lithe Branwen fighting\nsilently: her breasts and shoulders were naked, where Gwyllem had torn\naway her garments. He wheedled, laughed, swore, and hiccoughed, turn\nby turn, but she was silent.\n\n\"On guard!\" Richard barked. Gwyllem wheeled. His head twisted toward\nhis left shoulder, and one corner of his mouth convulsively snapped\nupward, so that his teeth were bared. There was a knife at Richard's\ngirdle, which he now unsheathed and flung away. He stepped eagerly\ntoward the snarling Welshman, and with both hands seized the thick and\nhairy throat. What followed was brutal.\n\nFor many minutes Branwen stood with averted face, shuddering. She very\ndimly heard the sound of Gwyllem's impotent fists as they beat against\nthe countenance and body of Richard, and heard the thin splitting\nvicious noise of torn cloth as Gwyllem clutched at Richard's tunic and\ntore it many times. Richard did not utter any articulate word, and\nGwyllem could not. There was entire silence for a heart-beat, and the\nthudding fall of something ponderous and limp.\n\n\"Come!\" Richard said then. Through the hut's twilight he came, as\nglorious in her eyes as Michael fresh from that primal battle with old\nSatan. Tall Richard came to her, his face all blood, and lifted her in\nhis arms lest Branwen's skirt be soiled by the demolished thing which\nsprawled across their path. She never spoke. She could not speak. In\nhis arms she rode homeward, passive, and content. The horse trod with\ndeliberation. In the east the young moon was taking heart as the\ndarkness thickened, and innumerable stars awoke. Branwen noted these\nthings incuriously.\n\nRichard was horribly afraid. He it had been, in sober verity it had\nbeen Richard of Bordeaux, that some monstrous force had seized, and\nhad lifted, and had curtly utilized as its handiest implement. He had\nbeen, and in the moment had known himself to be, the thrown spear as\nyet in air, about to kill and quite powerless to refrain from killing.\nIt was a full three minutes before he had got the better of his\nbewilderment and laughed, very softly, lest he disturb this Branwen,\nwho was so near his heart....\n\nNext day she came to him at noon, bearing as always the little basket.\nIt contained to-day a napkin, some garlic, a ham, and a small soft\ncheese; some shalots, salt, nuts, wild apples, lettuce, onions, and\nmushrooms. \"Behold a feast!\" said Richard. He noted then that she\ncarried also a blue pitcher filled with thin wine, and two cups of\noak-bark. She thanked him for last night's performance, and drank a\nmouthful of wine to his health.\n\n\"Decidedly, I shall be sorry to have done with shepherding,\" said\nRichard as he ate.\n\nBranwen answered, \"I too shall be sorry, lord, when the masquerade is\nended.\" And it seemed to Richard that she sighed, and he was the\nhappier.\n\nBut he only shrugged. \"I am the wisest person unhanged, since I\ncomprehend my own folly. Yet I grant you that he was wise, too, the\nminstrel of old time that sang: 'Over wild lands and tumbling seas\nflits Love, at will, and maddens the heart and beguiles the senses of\nall whom he attacks, whether his quarry be some monster of the ocean\nor some fierce denizen of the forest, or man; for thine, O Love, thine\nalone is the power to make playthings of us all.'\"\n\n\"Your bard was wise, no doubt, yet it was not in such terms that\nGwyllem sang of this passion. Lord,\" she demanded shyly, \"how would\nyou sing of love?\"\n\nRichard was replete and contented with the world. He took up the lute,\nin full consciousness that his compliance was in large part cenatory.\n\"In courtesy, thus--\"\n\nSang Richard:\n\n  \"The gods in honor of fair Branwen's worth\n  Bore gifts to her:--and Jove, Olympus' lord,\n  Co-rule of Earth and Heaven did accord,\n  And Hermes brought that lyre he framed at birth,\n  And Venus her famed girdle (to engirth\n  A fairer beauty now), and Mars his sword,\n  And wrinkled Plutus half the secret hoard\n  And immemorial treasure of mid-earth;--\n\n  \"And while the careful gods were pondering\n  Which of these goodly gifts the goodliest was,\n  Young Cupid came among them carolling\n  And proffered unto her a looking-glass,\n  Wherein she gazed, and saw the goodliest thing\n  That Earth had borne, and Heaven might not surpass.\"\n\n\"Three sounds are rarely heard,\" said Branwen; \"and these are the song\nof the birds of Rhiannon, an invitation to feast with a miser, and a\nspeech of wisdom from the mouth of a Saxon. The song you have made of\ncourtesy is tinsel. Sing now in verity.\"\n\nRichard laughed, though he was sensibly nettled and perhaps a shade\nabashed. Presently he sang again.\n\nSang Richard:\n\n  \"Catullus might have made of words that seek\n  With rippling sound, in soft recurrent ways,\n  The perfect song, or in remoter days\n  Theocritus have hymned you in glad Greek;\n  But I am not as they,--and dare not speak\n  Of you unworthily, and dare not praise\n  Perfection with imperfect roundelays,\n  And desecrate the prize I dare to seek.\n\n  \"I do not woo you, then, by fashioning\n  Vext analogues 'twixt you and Guenevere,\n  Nor do I come with agile lips that bring\n  The sugared periods of a sonneteer,\n  And bring no more--but just with, lips that cling\n  To yours, in murmuring, 'I love you, dear!'\"\n\nRichard had resolved that Branwen should believe him. Tinsel, indeed!\nthen here was yet more tinsel which she must receive as gold. He was\nvery angry, because his vanity was hurt, and the pin-prick spurred him\nto a counterfeit so specious that consciously he gloried in it. He was\nsuperb, and she believed him now; there was no questioning the fact,\nhe saw it plainly, and with exultant cruelty; then curt as lightning\ncame the knowledge that what Branwen believed was the truth.\n\nRichard had taken just two strides toward this fair girl. Branwen\nstayed motionless, her lips a little parted. The affairs of earth and\nheaven were motionless throughout the moment, attendant, it seemed to\nhim; and to him his whole life was like a wave that trembled now at\nfull height, and he was aware of a new world all made of beauty and of\npity. Then the lute fell from his spread out hands, and Richard\nsighed, and shrugged.\n\n\"There is a task set me,\" he said--\"it is God's work, I think. But I\ndo not know--I only know that you are very beautiful, Branwen,\" he\nsaid, and in the name he found a new and piercing loveliness.\n\nAnd he said also: \"Go! For I have loved many women, and, God help me!\nI know that I have but to wheedle you and you, too, will yield! Yonder\nis God's work to be done, and within me rages a commonwealth of\ndevils. Child! child!\" he cried, \"I am, and ever was, a coward, too\ntimid to face life without reserve, and always I laughed because I was\nafraid to concede that anything is serious!\"\n\nFor a long while Richard lay at his ease in the lengthening shadows of\nthe afternoon.\n\n\"I love her. She thinks me an elderly imbecile with a flat and reedy\nsinging-voice, and she is perfectly right. She has never even\nentertained the notion of loving me. That is well, for to-morrow, or,\nit may be, the day after, we must part forever. I would not have the\nparting make her sorrowful--or not, at least, too unalterably\nsorrowful. It is very well that Branwen does not love me.\n\n\"Why should she? I am almost twice her age, an aging fellow now,\nbattered and selfish and too indolent to love her--say, as Gwyllem\nloved her. I did well to kill that Gwyllem. I am profoundly glad I\nkilled him, and I thoroughly enjoyed doing it; but, after all, the man\nloved her in his fashion, and to the uttermost reach of his gross\nnature. I love her in a rather more decorous and acceptable fashion,\nit is true, but only a half of me loves her. The other half of me\nremembers that I am aging, that Caradawc's hut is leaky, that, in\nfine, bodily comfort is the single luxury of which one never tires. I\nam a very contemptible creature, the empty scabbard of a man,\nprecisely as Owain said.\" This settled, Richard whistled to his dog.\n\nThe sun had set. There were no shadows anywhere as Richard and his\nsheep went homeward, but on every side the colors of the world were\nmore sombre. Twice his flock roused a covey of partridges which had\nsettled for the night. The screech-owl had come out of his hole, and\nbats were already blundering about, and the air was cooling. There was\nas yet but one star in the green and cloudless heaven, and this was\nvery large, like a beacon: it appeared to him symbolical that he\ntrudged away from this star.\n\nNext morning the Welshmen came, and now the trap was ready for Henry\nof Lancaster.\n\nIt befell just two days later, about noon, that while Richard idly\ntalked with Branwen a party of soldiers, some fifteen in number, rode\ndown the river's bank from the ford above. Their leader paused, then\ngave an order. The men drew rein. He cantered forward.\n\n\"God give you joy, fair sir,\" said Richard, when the cavalier was near\nhim.\n\nThe new-comer raised his visor. \"God give you eternal joy, my fair\ncousin,\" he said, \"and very soon. Now send away this woman before that\nhappens which must happen.\"\n\n\"Do you plan,\" said Richard, \"to disfigure the stage of our quiet\npastorals with murder?\"\n\n\"I design my own preservation,\" King Henry answered, \"for while you\nlive my rule is insecure.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" Richard said, \"that in part my blood is yours.\"\n\nTwice he sounded his horn, and everywhere from rustling underwoods\narose the half-naked Welshmen. Said Richard: \"You should read history\nmore carefully, Cousin Henry. You might have profited, as I have done,\nby considering the trick which our grandfather, old Edward Longshanks,\nplayed on the French King at Mezelais. As matters stand, your men are\none to ten. You are impotent. Now, now we balance our accounts! These\npersons here will first deal with your followers. Then they will\nconduct you to Glyndwyr, who has long desired to deal with you\nhimself, in privacy, since that Whit-Monday when you murdered his\nson.\"\n\nThe King began, \"In mercy, sire--!\" and Richard laughed a little,\nsaying:\n\n\"That virtue is not overabundant among us of Oriander's blood, as we\nboth know. No, cousin, Fate and Time are merry jesters. See, now,\ntheir latest mockery! You the King of England ride to Sycharth to your\ndeath, and I the tender of sheep depart into London, without any\nhindrance, to reign henceforward over these islands. To-morrow you are\nworm's-meat, Cousin Henry: to-morrow, as yesterday, I am King of\nEngland.\"\n\nThen Branwen gave one sharp, brief cry, and Richard forgot all things\nsaving this girl, and strode to her. He had caught up her hard, lithe\nhands; against his lips he strained them close and very close.\n\n\"Branwen--!\" he said. His eyes devoured her.\n\n\"Yes, King,\" she answered. \"O King of England! O fool that I have been\nto think you less!\"\n\nIn a while Richard said: \"Well, I at least am not fool enough to think\nof making you a king's whore. So I must choose between a peasant wench\nand England. Now I choose, and how gladly! Branwen, help me to be more\nthan King of England!\"\n\nLow and very low he spoke, and long and very long he gazed at her, and\nneither seemed to breathe. Of what she thought I cannot tell you; but\nin Richard there was no power of thought, only a great wonderment.\nWhy, between this woman's love and aught else there was no choice for\nhim, he knew upon a sudden. Perhaps he would thus worship her always,\nhe reflected: and then again, perhaps he would be tired of her before\nlong, just as all other persons seemed to abate in these infatuations:\nmeanwhile it was certain that he was very happy. No, he could not go\nback to the throne and to the little French girl who was in law his\nwife.\n\nAnd, as if from an immense distance, came to Richard the dogged voice\nof Henry of Lancaster. \"It is of common report in these islands that I\nhave a better right to the throne than you. As much was told our\ngrandfather, King Edward of happy memory, when he educated you and had\nyou acknowledged heir to the crown, but his love was so strong for his\nson the Prince of Wales that nothing could alter his purpose. And\nindeed if you had followed even the example of the Black Prince you\nmight still have been our King; but you have always acted so\ncontrarily to his admirable precedents as to occasion the rumor to be\ngenerally believed throughout England that you were not, after all,\nhis son--\"\n\nRichard had turned impatiently. \"For the love of Heaven, truncate your\nabominable periods. Be off with you. Yonder across that river is the\nthrone of England, which you appear, through some lunacy, to consider\na desirable possession. Take it, then; for, praise God! the sword has\nfound its sheath.\"\n\nThe King answered: \"I do not ask you to reconsider your dismissal,\nassuredly--Richard,\" he cried, a little shaken, \"I perceive that until\nyour death you will win contempt and love from every person.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, for many years I have been the playmate of the world,\" said\nRichard; \"but to-day I wash my hands, and set about another and more\nlaudable business. I had dreamed certain dreams, indeed--but what had\nI to do with all this strife between the devil and the tiger? No,\nGlyndwyr will set up Mortimer against you now, and you two must fight\nit out. I am no more his tool, and no more your enemy, my\ncousin--Henry,\" he said with quickening voice, \"there was a time when\nwe were boys and played together, and there was no hatred between us,\nand I regret that time!\"\n\n\"As God lives, I too regret that time!\" the bluff, squinting King\nreplied. He stared at Richard for a while wherein each understood.\n\"Dear fool,\" Sire Henry said, \"there is no man in all the world but\nhates me saving only you.\" Then the proud King clapped spurs to his\nproud horse and rode away.\n\nMore lately Richard dismissed his wondering marauders. Now he and\nBranwen were alone and a little troubled, since each was afraid of\nthat oncoming moment when their eyes must meet.\n\nSo Richard laughed. \"Praise God!\" he wildly cried, \"I am the greatest\nfool unhanged!\"\n\nShe answered: \"I am the happier for your folly. I am the happiest of\nGod's creatures.\"\n\nAnd Richard meditated. \"Faith of a gentleman!\" he declared; \"but you\nare nothing of the sort, and of this fact I happen to be quite\ncertain.\" Their lips met then and afterward their eyes; and each of\nthese ragged peasants was too glad for laughter.\n\nTHE END OF THE EIGHTH NOVEL\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE STORY OF THE NAVARRESE\n\n\n  \"J'ay en mon cueur joyeusement\n  Escript, afin que ne l'oublie,\n  Ce refrain qu'ayme chierement,\n  C'estes vous de qui suis amye.\"\n\nTHE NINTH NOVEL.--JEHANE OF NAVARRE, AFTER A WITHSTANDING OF ALL OTHER\nASSAULTS, IS IN A LONG DUEL, WHEREIN TIME AND COMMON-SENSE ARE\nFLOUTED, AND KINGDOMS ARE SHAKEN, DETHRONED AND RECOMPENSED BY AN\nENDURING LUNACY.\n\n\n\n\n_The Story of the Navarrese_\n\n\nIn the year of grace 1386, upon the feast of Saint Bartholomew (thus\nNicolas begins), came to the Spanish coast Messire Peyre de Lesnerac,\nin a war-ship sumptuously furnished and manned by many persons of\ndignity and wealth, in order suitably to escort the Princess Jehane\ninto Brittany, where she was to marry the Duke of that province. There\nwere now rejoicings throughout Navarre, in which the Princess took but\na nominal part and young Antoine Riczi none at all.\n\nThis Antoine Riczi came to Jehane that August twilight in the hedged\ngarden. \"King's daughter!\" he sadly greeted her. \"Duchess of Brittany!\nCountess of Rougemont! Lady of Nantes and of Guerrand! of Rais and of\nToufon and Guerche!\"\n\nShe answered, \"No, my dearest,--I am that Jehane, whose only title is\nthe Constant Lover.\" And in the green twilight, lit as yet by one\nlow-hanging star alone, their lips and desperate young bodies clung,\nnow, it might be, for the last time.\n\nPresently the girl spoke. Her soft mouth was lax and tremulous, and\nher gray eyes were more brilliant than the star yonder. The boy's arms\nwere about her, so that neither could be quite unhappy, yet.\n\n\"Friend,\" said Jehane, \"I have no choice. I must wed with this de\nMontfort. I think I shall die presently. I have prayed God that I may\ndie before they bring me to the dotard's bed.\"\n\nYoung Riczi held her now in an embrace more brutal. \"Mine! mine!\" he\nsnarled toward the obscuring heavens.\n\n\"Yet it may be I must live. Friend, the man is very old. Is it wicked\nto think of that? For I cannot but think of his great age.\"\n\nThen Riczi answered: \"My desires--may God forgive me!--have clutched\nlike starving persons at that sorry sustenance. Friend! ah, fair,\nsweet friend! the man is human and must die, but love, we read, is\nimmortal. I am wishful to kill myself, Jehane. But, oh, Jehane! dare\nyou to bid me live?\"\n\n\"Friend, as you love me, I entreat you to live. Friend, I crave of the\nEternal Father that if I falter in my love for you I may be denied\neven the one bleak night of ease which Judas knows.\" The girl did not\nweep; dry-eyed she winged a perfectly sincere prayer toward\nincorruptible saints. Riczi was to remember the fact, and through long\nyears of severance.\n\nFor even now, as Riczi went away from Jehane, a shrill singing-girl\nwas rehearsing, yonder behind the yew-hedge, the song which she was to\nsing at Jehane's bridal feast.\n\nSang this joculatrix:\n\n  \"When the Morning broke before us\n  Came the wayward Three astraying,\n  Chattering in babbling chorus,\n  (Obloquies of Aether saying),--\n  Hoidens that, at pegtop playing,\n  Flung their Top where yet it whirls\n  Through the coil of clouds unstaying,\n  For the Fates are captious girls!\"\n\nAnd upon the next day de Lesnerac bore young Jehane from Pampeluna and\npresently to Saill\u00e9, where old Jehan the Brave took her to wife. She\nlived as a queen, but she was a woman of infrequent laughter.\n\nShe had Duke Jehan's adoration, and his barons' obeisancy, and his\nvillagers applauded her passage with stentorian shouts. She passed\ninterminable days amid bright curious arrasses and trod listlessly\nover pavements strewn with flowers. She had fiery-hearted jewels, and\nshimmering purple cloths, and much furniture adroitly carven, and many\ntapestries of Samarcand and Baldach upon which were embroidered, by\nbrown fingers that time had turned long ago to Asian dust, innumerable\nasps and deer and phoenixes and dragons and all the motley inhabitants\nof air and of the thicket; but her memories, too, she had, and for a\ndreary while she got no comfort because of them. Then ambition\nquickened.\n\nYoung Antoine Riczi likewise nursed his wound as best he might; but at\nthe end of the second year after Jehane's wedding his uncle, the\nVicomte de Montbrison--a gaunt man, with preoccupied and troubled\neyes--had summoned Antoine into Lyonnois and, after appropriate\nsalutation, had informed the lad that, as the Vicomte's heir, he was\nto marry the Demoiselle Gerberge de N\u00e9rac upon the ensuing Michaelmas.\n\n\"That I may not do,\" said Riczi; and since a chronicler that would\ntempt fortune should never stretch the fabric of his wares too thin\n(unlike Sir Hengist), I merely tell you these two dwelt together at\nMontbrison for a decade: and the Vicomte swore at his nephew and\npredicted this or that disastrous destination as often as Antoine\ndeclined to marry the latest of his uncle's candidates,--in whom the\nVicomte was of an astonishing fertility.\n\nIn the year of grace 1401 came the belated news that Duke Jehan had\nclosed his final day. \"You will be leaving me!\" the Vicomte growled;\n\"now, in my decrepitude, you will be leaving me! It is abominable, and\nI shall in all likelihood disinherit you this very night.\"\n\n\"Yet it is necessary,\" Riczi answered; and, filled with no unhallowed\njoy, he rode for Vannes, in Brittany, where the Duchess-Regent held\nher court. Dame Jehane had within that fortnight put aside her\nmourning. She sat beneath a green canopy, gold-fringed and powdered\nwith many golden stars, when Riczi came again to her, and the rising\nsaps of spring were exercising their august and formidable influence.\nShe sat alone, by prearrangement, to one end of the high-ceiled and\nradiant apartment; midway in the hall her lords and divers ladies were\ngathered about a saltatrice and a jongleur, who were diverting the\ncourtiers, to the mincing accompaniment of a lute; but Jehane sat\napart from these, frail, and splendid with many jewels, and a little\nsad.\n\nAnd Antoine Riczi found no power of speech within him at the first.\nSilent he stood before her, still as an effigy, while meltingly the\njongleur sang.\n\n\"Jehane!\" said Antoine Riczi, in a while, \"have you, then, forgotten,\nO Jehane?\"\n\nThe resplendent woman had not moved at all. It was as though she were\nsome tinted and lavishly adorned statue of barbaric heathenry, and he\nher postulant; and her large eyes appeared to judge an immeasurable\npath, beyond him. Now her lips fluttered somewhat. \"I am the Duchess\nof Brittany,\" she said, in the phantom of a voice. \"I am the Countess\nof Rougemont. The Lady of Nantes and of Guerrand! of Rais and of\nToufon and Guerche!... Jehane is dead.\"\n\nThe man had drawn one audible breath. \"You are that Jehane, whose only\ntitle is the Constant Lover!\"\n\n\"Friend, the world smirches us,\" she said half-pleadingly, \"I have\ntasted too deep of wealth and power. I am drunk with a deadly wine,\nand ever I thirst--I thirst--\"\n\n\"Jehane, do you remember that May morning in Pampeluna when first I\nkissed you, and about us sang many birds? Then as now you wore a gown\nof green, Jehane.\"\n\n\"Friend, I have swayed kingdoms since.\"\n\n\"Jehane, do you remember that August twilight in Pampeluna when last I\nkissed you? Then as now you wore a gown of green, Jehane.\"\n\n\"But I wore no such chain as this about my neck,\" the woman answered,\nand lifted a huge golden collar garnished with emeralds and sapphires\nand with many pearls. \"Friend, the chain is heavy, yet I lack the will\nto cast it off. I lack the will, Antoine.\" And now with a sudden shout\nof mirth her courtiers applauded the evolutions of the saltatrice.\n\n\"King's daughter!\" said Riczi then; \"O perilous merchandise! a god\ncame to me and a sword had pierced his breast. He touched the gold\nhilt of it and said, 'Take back your weapon.' I answered, 'I do not\nknow you.' 'I am Youth' he said; 'take back your weapon.'\"\n\n\"It is true,\" she responded, \"it is lamentably true that after\nto-night we are as different persons, you and I.\"\n\nHe said: \"Jehane, do you not love me any longer? Remember old years\nand do not break your oath with me, Jehane, since God abhors nothing\nso much as unfaith. For your own sake, Jehane,--ah, no, not for your\nsake nor for mine, but for the sake of that blithe Jehane, whom, so\nyou tell me, time has slain!\"\n\nOnce or twice she blinked, as if dazzled by a light of intolerable\nsplendor, but otherwise she stayed rigid. \"You have dared, messire, to\nconfront me with the golden-hearted, clean-eyed Navarrese that once\nwas I! and I requite.\" The austere woman rose. \"Messire, you swore to\nme, long since, eternal service. I claim my right in domnei.\nYonder--gray-bearded, the man in black and silver--is the Earl of\nWorcester, the King of England's ambassador, in common with whom the\nwealthy dowager of Brittany has signed a certain contract. Go you,\nthen, with Worcester into England, as my proxy, and in that island, as\nmy proxy, become the wife of the King of England. Messire, your\naudience is done.\"\n\nRiczi said this: \"Can you hurt me any more, Jehane?--no, even in hell\nthey cannot hurt me now. Yet I, at least, keep faith, and in your face\nI fling faith like a glove--old-fashioned, it may be, but clean,--and\nI will go, Jehane.\"\n\nHer heart raged. \"Poor, glorious fool!\" she thought; \"had you but the\nwit even now to use me brutally, even now to drag me from this\nda\u00efs--!\" Instead he went away from her smilingly, treading through the\nhall with many affable salutations, while the jongleur sang.\n\nSang the jongleur:\n\n  \"There is a land those hereabout\n  Ignore ... Its gates are barred\n  By Titan twins, named Fear and Doubt.\n  These mercifully guard\n  That land we seek--the land so fair!--\n  And all the fields thereof,\n  Where daffodils flaunt everywhere\n  And ouzels chant of love,--\n  Lest we attain the Middle-Land,\n  Whence clouded well-springs rise,\n  And vipers from a slimy strand\n  Lift glittering cold eyes.\n\n  \"Now, the parable all may understand,\n  And surely you know the name of the land!\n  Ah, never a guide or ever a chart\n  May safely lead you about this land,--\n  The Land of the Human Heart!\"\n\nAnd the following morning, being duly empowered, Antoine Riczi sailed\nfor England in company with the Earl of Worcester; and upon Saint\nRichard's day the next ensuing was, at Eltham, as proxy of Jehane,\nmarried in his own person to the bloat King Henry, the fourth of that\nname to reign. This king was that same squinting Harry of Derby\n(called also Henry of Lancaster and Bolingbroke) who stole his\ncousin's crown, and about whom I have told you in the preceding story.\nFirst Sire Henry placed the ring on Riczi's finger, and then spoke\nAntoine Riczi, very loud and clear:\n\n\"I, Antoine Riczi,--in the name of my worshipful lady, Dame Jehane,\nthe daughter of Messire Charles until lately King of Navarre, the\nDuchess of Brittany and the Countess of Rougemont,--do take you, Sire\nHenry of Lancaster, King of England and in title of France, and Lord\nof Ireland, to be my husband; and thereto I, Antoine Riczi, in the\nspirit of my said lady\"--the speaker paused here to regard the gross\nhulk of masculinity before him, and then smiled very sadly--\"in\nprecisely the spirit of my said lady, I plight you my troth.\"\n\nAfterward the King made him presents of some rich garments of scarlet\ntrimmed with costly furs, and of four silk belts studded with silver\nand gold, and with valuable clasps, of which the owner might well be\nproud, and Riczi returned to Lyonnois. \"Depardieux!\" his uncle said;\n\"so you return alone!\"\n\n\"I return as did Prince Troilus,\" said Riczi--\"to boast to you of\nliberal entertainment in the tent of Diomede.\"\n\n\"You are certainly an inveterate fool,\" the Vicomte considered after a\nprolonged appraisal of his face, \"since there is always a deal of\nother pink-and-white flesh as yet unmortgaged--Boy with my brother's\neyes!\" the Vicomte said, in another voice; \"I have heard of the task\nput upon you: and I would that I were God to punish as is fitting! But\nyou are welcome home, my lad.\"\n\nSo these two abode together at Montbrison for a long time, and in the\npurlieus of that place hunted and hawked, and made sonnets once in a\nwhile, and read aloud from old romances some five days out of the\nseven. The verses of Riczi were in the year of grace 1410 made public,\nnot without acclamation; and thereafter the stripling Comte de\nCharolais, future heir to all Burgundy and a zealous patron of rhyme,\nwas much at Montbrison, and there conceived for Antoine Riczi such\nadmiration as was possible to a very young man only.\n\nIn the year of grace 1412 the Vicomte, being then bedridden, died\nwithout any disease and of no malady save the inherencies of his age.\n\"I entreat of you, my nephew,\" he said at last, \"that always you use\nas touchstone the brave deed you did at Eltham. It is necessary for a\ngentleman to serve his lady according to her commandments, but you\nperformed the most absurd and the most cruel task which any woman ever\nimposed upon her lover and servitor in domnei. I laugh at you, and I\nenvy you.\" Thus he died, about Martinmas.\n\nNow was Antoine Riczi a powerful baron, but he got no comfort of his\nlordship, because that old incendiary, the King of Darkness, daily\nadded fuel to a smouldering sorrow until grief quickened into vaulting\nflames of wrath and of disgust.\n\n\"What now avail my riches?\" said the Vicomte. \"How much wealthier was\nI when I was loved, and was myself an eager lover! I relish no other\npleasures than those of love. I am Love's sot, drunk with a deadly\nwine, poor fool, and ever I thirst. All my chattels and my acres\nappear to me to be bright vapors, and the more my dominion and my\npower increase, the more rancorously does my heart sustain its\nbitterness over having been robbed of that fair merchandise which is\nthe King of England's. To hate her is scant comfort and to despise her\nnone at all, since it follows that I who am unable to forget the\nwanton am even more to be despised than she. I will go into England\nand execute what mischief I may against her.\"\n\nThe new Vicomte de Montbrison set forth for Paris, first to do homage\nfor his fief, and secondly to be accredited for some plausible mission\ninto England. But in Paris he got disquieting news. Jehane's husband\nwas dead, and her stepson Henry, the fifth monarch of that name to\nreign in Britain, had invaded France to support preposterous claims\nwhich the man advanced to the crown of that latter kingdom; and as the\nearth is altered by the advent of winter, so was the appearance of\nFrance transformed by King Henry's coming, and everywhere the nobles\nwere stirred up to arms, the castles were closed, the huddled cities\nwere fortified, and on every side arose entrenchments.\n\nThus through this sudden turn was the new Vicomte, the dreamer and the\nrecluse, caught up by the career of events, as a straw is borne away\nby a torrent, when the French lords marched with their vassals to\nHarfleur, where they were soundly drubbed by the King of England; as\nafterward at Agincourt.\n\nBut in the year of grace 1417 there was a breathing space for\ndiscredited France, and presently the Vicomte de Montbrison was sent\ninto England, as ambassador. He got in London a fruitless audience of\nKing Henry, whose demands were such as rendered a renewal of the war\ninevitable; and afterward got, in the month of April, about the day of\nPalm Sunday, at the Queen's dower-palace of Havering-Bower, an\ninterview with Queen Jehane.[*]\n\n[*Nicolas unaccountably omits to mention that during the French\nwars she had ruled England as Regent with signal capacity,--although\nthis fact, as you will see more lately, is the pivot of his\nchronicle.]\n\nA curled pert page took the Vicomte to where she sat alone, by\nprearrangement, in a chamber with painted walls, profusely lighted by\nthe sun, and made pretence to weave a tapestry. When the page had gone\nshe rose and cast aside the shuttle, and then with a glad and wordless\ncry stumbled toward the Vicomte. \"Madame and Queen--!\" he coldly said.\n\nHis judgment found in her a quite ordinary, frightened woman, aging\nnow, but still very handsome in these black and shimmering gold robes;\nbut all his other faculties found her desirable: and with a contained\nhatred he had perceived, as if by the terse illumination of a\nthunderbolt, that he could never love any woman save the woman whom he\nmost despised.\n\nShe said: \"I had forgotten. I had remembered only you, Antoine, and\nNavarre, and the clean-eyed Navarrese--\" Now for a little, Jehane\npaced the gleaming and sun-drenched apartment as a bright leopardess\nmight tread her cage. Then she wheeled. \"Friend, I think that God\nHimself has deigned to avenge you. All misery my reign has been. First\nHotspur, then prim Worcester harried us. Came Glyndwyr afterward to\nprick us with his devils' horns. Followed the dreary years that linked\nme to the rotting corpse which God's leprosy devoured while the poor\nfurtive thing yet moved, and endured its share in the punishment of\nManuel's poisonous blood. All misery, Antoine! And now I live beneath\na sword.\"\n\n\"You have earned no more,\" he said. \"You have earned no more, O\nJehane! whose only title is the Constant Lover!\" He spat it out.\n\nShe came uncertainly toward him, as though he had been some not\nimplacable knave with a bludgeon. \"For the King hates me,\" she\nplaintively said, \"and I live beneath a sword. The big, fierce-eyed\nboy has hated me from the first, for all his lip-courtesy. And now he\nlacks the money to pay his troops, and I am the wealthiest person\nwithin his realm. I am a woman and alone in a foreign land. So I must\nwait, and wait, and wait, Antoine, till he devises some trumped-up\naccusation. Friend, I live as did Saint Damoclus, beneath a sword.\nAntoine!\" she wailed--for now the pride of Queen Jehane was shattered\nutterly--\"I am held as a prisoner for all that my chains are of gold.\"\n\n\"Yet it was not until of late,\" he observed, \"that you disliked the\nmetal which is the substance of all crowns.\"\n\nAnd now the woman lifted toward him her massive golden necklace,\ngarnished with emeralds and sapphires and with many pearls, and in the\nsunlight the gems were tawdry things. \"Friend, the chain is heavy, and\nI lack the power to cast it off. The Navarrese we know of wore no such\nperilous fetters. Ah, you should have mastered me at Vannes. You could\nhave done so, very easily. But you only talked--oh, Mary pity us! you\nonly talked!--and I could find only a servant where I had sore need to\nfind a master. Let all women pity me!\"\n\nBut now came many armed soldiers into the apartment. With spirit Queen\nJehane turned to meet them, and you saw that she was of royal blood,\nfor now the pride of many emperors blazed and informed her body as\nlight occupies a lantern. \"At last you come for me, messieurs?\"\n\n\"Whereas,\" the leader of these soldiers read from a\nparchment--\"whereas the King's stepmother, Queen Jehane, is accused by\ncertain persons of an act of witch-craft that with diabolical and\nsubtile methods wrought privily to destroy the King, the said Dame\nJehane is by the King committed (all her attendants being removed) to\nthe custody of Sir John Pelham, who will, at the King's pleasure,\nconfine her within Pevensey Castle, there to be kept under Sir John's\ncontrol: the lands and other properties of the said Dame Jehane being\nhereby forfeit to the King, whom God preserve!\"\n\n\"Harry of Monmouth!\" said Jehane,--\"ah, my tall stepson, could I but\ncome to you, very quietly, with a knife--!\" She shrugged her\nshoulders, and the gold about her person glittered in the sunlight.\n\"Witchcraft! ohim\u00e9, one never disproves that. Friend, now are you\navenged the more abundantly.\"\n\n\"Young Riczi is avenged,\" the Vicomte said; \"and I came hither\ndesiring vengeance.\"\n\nShe wheeled, a lithe flame (he thought) of splendid fury. \"And in the\ngutter Jehane dares say what Queen Jehane upon the throne might never\nsay. Had I reigned all these years as mistress not of England but of\nEurope,--had nations wheedled me in the place of barons,--young Riczi\nhad been none the less avenged. Bah! what do these so-little persons\nmatter? Take now your petty vengeance! drink deep of it! and know that\nalways within my heart the Navarrese has lived to shame me! Know that\nto-day you despise Jehane, the purchased woman! and that Jehane loves\nyou! and that the love of proud Jehane creeps like a beaten cur toward\nyour feet, in the sight of common men! and know that Riczi is\navenged,--you milliner!\"\n\n\"Into England I came desiring vengeance--Apples of Sodom! O bitter\nfruit!\" the Vicomte thought; \"O fitting harvest of a fool's assiduous\nhusbandry!\"\n\nThey took her from him: and that afternoon, after long meditation, the\nVicomte de Montbrison entreated a second private audience of King\nHenry, and readily obtained it. \"Unhardy is unseely,\" the Vicomte said\nat this interview's conclusion. The tale tells that the Vicomte\nreturned to France and within this realm assembled all such lords as\nthe abuses of the Queen-Regent Isabeau had more notoriously\ndissatisfied.\n\nThe Vicomte had upon occasion an invaluable power of speech; and now,\nso great was the devotion of love's dupe, so heartily, so hastily, did\nhe design to remove the discomforts of Queen Jehane, that now his\neloquence was twin to Belial's insidious talking when that fiend\ntempts us to some proud iniquity.\n\nThen presently these lords had sided with King Henry, as did the\nVicomte de Montbrison, in open field. Next, as luck would have it,\nJehan Sans-Peur was slain at Montereau; and a little later the new\nDuke of Burgundy, who loved the Vicomte as he loved no other man, had\nshifted his coat, forsaking France. These treacheries brought down the\nwavering scales of warfare, suddenly, with an aweful clangor; and now\nin France clean-hearted persons spoke of the Vicomte de Montbrison as\nthey would speak of Ganelon or of Iscariot, and in every market-place\nwas King Henry proclaimed as governor of the realm.\n\nMeantime Queen Jehane had been conveyed to prison and lodged therein.\nShe had the liberty of a tiny garden, high-walled, and of two scantily\nfurnished chambers. The brace of hard-featured females whom Pelham had\nprovided for the Queen's attendance might speak to her of nothing that\noccurred without the gates of Pevensey, and she saw no other persons\nsave her confessor, a triple-chinned Dominican; had men already lain\nJehane within the massive and gilded coffin of a queen the outer world\nwould have made as great a turbulence in her ears.\n\nBut in the year of grace 1422, upon the feast of Saint Bartholomew,\nand about vespers--for thus it wonderfully fell out,--one of those\ngrim attendants brought to her the first man, save the fat confessor,\nwhom the Queen had seen within five years. The proud, frail woman\nlooked and what she saw was the inhabitant of all her dreams.\n\nSaid Jehane: \"This is ill done. Time has avenged you. Be contented\nwith that knowledge, and, for Heaven's sake, do not endeavor to\nmoralize over the ruin which Heaven has made, and justly made, of\nQueen Jehane, as I perceive you mean to do.\" She leaned backward in\nthe chair, very coarsely clad in brown, but knowing that her coloring\nwas excellent, that she had miraculously preserved her figure, and\nthat she did not look her real age by a good ten years. Such\nreflections beget spiritual comfort even in a prison.\n\n\"Friend,\" the lean-faced man now said, \"I do not come with such\nintent, as my mission will readily attest, nor to any ruin, as your\nmirror will attest. Instead, madame, I come as the emissary of King\nHenry, now dying at Vincennes, and with letters to the lords and\nbishops of his council. Dying, the man restores to you your liberty\nand your dower-lands, your bed and all your movables, and six gowns of\nsuch fashion and such color as you may elect.\"\n\nThen with hurried speech he told her of five years' events: of how\nwithin that period King Henry had conquered France, and had married\nthe French King's daughter, and had begotten a boy who would presently\ninherit the united realms of France and England, since in the supreme\nhour of triumph King Henry had been stricken with a mortal sickness,\nand now lay dying, or perhaps already dead, at Vincennes; and of how\nwith his penultimate breath the prostrate conqueror had restored to\nQueen Jehane all properties and all honors which she formerly enjoyed.\n\n\"I shall once more be Regent,\" the woman said when the Vicomte had\nmade an end; \"Antoine, I shall presently be Regent both of France and\nof England, since Dame Katharine is but a child.\" Jehane stood\nmotionless save for the fine hands that plucked the air. \"Mistress of\nEurope! absolute mistress, and with an infant ward! now, may God have\nmercy on my unfriends, for they will soon perceive great need of it!\"\n\n\"Yet was mercy ever the prerogative of royal persons,\" the Vicomte\nsuavely said, \"and the Navarrese we know of was both royal and very\nmerciful, O Constant Lover.\"\n\nThe speech was as a whip-lash. Abruptly suspicion kindled in her\nshrewd gray eyes. \"Harry of Monmouth feared neither man nor God. It\nneeded more than any death-bed repentance to frighten him into\nrestoring my liberty.\" There was a silence. \"You, a Frenchman, come as\nthe emissary of King Henry who has devastated France! are there no\nEnglish lords, then, left alive of his, army?\"\n\nThe Vicomte de Montbrison said; \"There is at all events no person\nbetter fitted to patch up this dishonorable business of your\ncaptivity, in which no clean man would care to meddle.\"\n\nShe appraised this, and said with entire irrelevance: \"The world has\nsmirched you, somehow. At last you have done something save consider\nhow badly I treated you. I praise God, Antoine, for it brings you\nnearer.\"\n\nHe told her all. King Henry, it appeared, had dealt with him at\nHavering in perfect frankness. The King needed money for his wars in\nFrance, and failing the seizure of Jehane's enormous wealth, had\nexhausted every resource. \"And France I mean to have,\" the King said.\n\"Now the world knows you enjoy the favor of the Comte de Charolais; so\nget me an alliance with Burgundy against my imbecile brother of\nFrance, and Dame Jehane shall repossess her liberty. There you have my\nprice.\"\n\n\"And this price I paid,\" the Vicomte sternly said, \"for 'Unhardy is\nunseely,' Satan whispered, and I knew that Duke Philippe trusted me.\nYea, all Burgundy I marshalled under your stepson's banner, and for\nthree years I fought beneath his loathed banner, until at Troyes we\nhad trapped and slain the last loyal Frenchman. And to-day in France\nmy lands are confiscate, and there is not an honest Frenchman but\nspits upon my name. All infamy I come to you for this last time,\nJehane! as a man already dead I come to you, Jehane, for in France\nthey thirst to murder me, and England has no further need of\nMontbrison, her blunted and her filthy instrument!\"\n\nThe woman nodded here. \"You have set my thankless service above your\nlife, above your honor. I find the rhymester glorious and very vile.\"\n\n\"All vile,\" he answered; \"and outworn! King's daughter, I swore to\nyou, long since, eternal service. Of love I freely gave you yonder in\nNavarre, as yonder at Eltham I crucified my innermost heart for your\ndelectation. Yet I, at least, keep faith, and in your face I fling\nfaith like a glove--outworn, it may be, and God knows, unclean! Yet I,\nat least, keep faith! Lands and wealth have I given, up for you, O\nking's daughter, and life itself have I given you, and lifelong\nservice have I given you, and all that I had save honor; and at the\nlast I give you honor, too. Now let the naked fool depart, Jehane, for\nhe has nothing more to give.\"\n\nWhile the Vicomte de Montbrison spoke thus, she had leaned upon the\nsill of an open casement. \"Indeed, it had been better,\" she said,\nstill with her face averted, and gazing downward at the tree-tops\nbeneath, \"it had been far better had we never met. For this love of\nours has proven a tyrannous and evil lord. I have had everything, and\nupon each feast of will and sense the world afforded me this love has\nswept down, like a harpy--was it not a harpy you called the bird in\nthat old poem of yours?--to rob me of delight. And you have had\nnothing, for he has pilfered you of life, giving only dreams in\nexchange, my poor Antoine, and he has led you at the last to infamy.\nWe are as God made us, and--I may not understand why He permits this\ndespotism.\"\n\nThereafter, somewhere below, a peasant sang as he passed supperward\nthrough the green twilight, lit as yet by one low-hanging star alone.\n\nSang the peasant:\n\n  \"King Jesus hung upon the Cross,\n  'And have ye sinned?' quo' He,--.\n  'Nay, Dysmas, 'tis no honest loss\n  When Satan cogs the dice ye toss,\n  And thou shall sup with Me,--\n  Sedebis apud angelos,\n  Quia amavisti!'\n\n  \"At Heaven's Gate was Heaven's Queen,\n  'And have ye sinned?' quo' She,--\n  'And would I hold him worth a bean\n  That durst not seek, because unclean,\n  My cleansing charity?--\n  Speak thou that wast the Magdalene,\n  Quia amavisti!'\"\n\n\"It may be that in some sort the jingle answers me!\" then said Jehane;\nand she began with an odd breathlessness, \"Friend, when King Henry\ndies--and even now he dies--shall I not as Regent possess such power\nas no woman has ever wielded in Europe? can aught prevent this?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" he answered. \"You leave this prison to rule over England\nagain, and over conquered France as well, and naught can prevent it.\"\n\n\"Unless, friend, I were wedded to a Frenchman. Then would the stern\nEnglish lords never permit that I have any finger in the government.\"\nShe came to him with conspicuous deliberation and rested her hands\nupon his breast. \"Friend, I am weary of these tinsel splendors. What\nare this England and this France to me, who crave the real kingdom?\"\n\nHer mouth was tremulous and lax, and her gray eyes were more brilliant\nthan the star yonder. The man's arms were about her, and of the man's\nface I cannot tell you. \"King's daughter! mistress of half Europe! I\nam a beggar, an outcast, as a leper among honorable persons.\"\n\nBut it was as though he had not spoken. \"Friend, it was for this I\nhave outlived these garish, fevered years, it was this which made me\nglad when I was a child and laughed without knowing why. That I might\nto-day give up this so-great power for love of you, my all-incapable\nand soiled Antoine, was, as I now know, the end to which the Eternal\nFather created me. For, look you,\" she pleaded, \"to surrender absolute\ndominion over half Europe is a sacrifice. Assure me that it is a\nsacrifice, Antoine! O glorious fool, delude me into the belief that I\nsurrender much in choosing you! Nay, I know it is as nothing beside\nwhat you have given up for me, but it is all I have--it is all I have,\nAntoine!\"\n\nHe drew a deep and big-lunged breath that seemed to inform his being\nwith an indomitable vigor; and grief and doubtfulness went quite away\nfrom him. \"Love leads us,\" he said, \"and through the sunlight of the\nworld Love leads us, and through the filth of it Love leads us, but\nalways in the end, if we but follow without swerving, Love leads\nupward. Yet, O God upon the Cross! Thou that in the article of death\ndidst pardon Dysmas! as what maimed warriors of life, as what bemired\ntravellers in muddied byways, must we presently come to Thee!\"\n\n\"Ah, but we will come hand in hand,\" she answered; \"and He will\ncomprehend.\"\n\nTHE END OF THE NINTH NOVEL\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE STORY OF THE FOX-BRUSH\n\n\n  \"Dame serez de mon cueur, sans debat,\n  Entierement, jusques mort me consume.\n  Laurier sou\u00ebf qui pour mon droit combat,\n  Olivier franc, m'ostant toute amertume.\"\n\nTHE TENTH NOVEL.--KATHARINE OF VALOIS IS LOVED BY A HUNTSMAN, AND\nLOVES HIM GREATLY; THEN FINDS HIM, TO HER HORROR, AN IMPOSTOR; AND FOR\nA SUFFICIENT REASON CONSENTS TO MARRY QUITE ANOTHER PERSON, NOT ALL\nUNWILLINGLY.\n\n\n\n\n_The Story of the Fox-Brush_\n\n\nIn the year of grace 1417, about Martinmas (thus Nicolas begins),\nQueen Isabeau fled with her daughter the Lady Katharine to Chartres.\nThere the Queen was met by the Duke of Burgundy, and these two laid\ntheir heads together to such good effect that presently they got back\ninto Paris, and in its public places massacred some three thousand\nArmagnacs. That, however, is a matter which touches history; the root\nof our concernment is that, when the Queen and the Duke rode off to\nattend to this butcher's business, the Lady Katharine was left behind\nin the Convent of Saint Scholastica, which then stood upon the\noutskirts of Chartres, in the bend of the Eure just south of that\ncity. She dwelt for a year in this well-ordered place.\n\nThere one finds her upon the day of the decollation of Saint John the\nBaptist, the fine August morning that starts the tale. Katharine the\nFair, men called her, with considerable show of reason. She was very\ntall, and slim as a rush. Her eyes were large and black, having an\nextreme lustre, like the gleam of undried ink,--a lustre at some times\nuncanny. Her abundant hair, too, was black, and to-day seemed doubly\nsombre by contrast with the gold netting which confined it. Her mouth\nwas scarlet, all curves, and her complexion was famous for its\nbrilliancy; only a precisian would have objected that she possessed\nthe Valois nose, long and thin and somewhat unduly overhanging the\nmouth.\n\nTo-day as she came through the orchard, crimson garbed, she paused\nwith lifted eyebrows. Beyond the orchard wall there was a hodgepodge\nof noises, among which a nice ear might distinguish the clatter of\nhoofs, a yelping and scurrying, and a contention of soft bodies, and\nabove all a man's voice commanding the turmoil. She was seventeen, so\nshe climbed into the crotch of an apple-tree and peered over the wall.\n\nHe was in rusty brown and not unshabby; but her regard swept over this\nto his face, and there noted how his eyes shone like blue winter stars\nunder the tumbled yellow hair, and noted the flash of his big teeth as\nhe swore between them. He held a dead fox by the brush, which he was\ncutting off; two hounds, lank and wolfish, were scaling his huge body\nin frantic attempts to get at the carrion. A horse grazed close at\nhand.\n\nSo for a heart-beat she saw him. Then he flung the tailless body to\nthe hounds, and in the act spied two black eyes peeping through the\napple-leaves. He laughed, all mirth to the heels of him.\n\"Mademoiselle, I fear we have disturbed your devotions. But I had not\nheard that it was a Benedictine custom to rehearse aves in tree-tops.\"\nThen, as she leaned forward, both elbows resting more comfortably upon\nthe wall, and thereby disclosing her slim body among the foliage like\na crimson flower green-calyxed, he said, \"You are not a nun--Blood of\nGod! you are the Princess Katharine!\"\n\nThe nuns, her present guardians, would have declared the ensuing\naction horrific, for Katharine smiled frankly at him and asked how\ncould he thus recognise her at one glance.\n\nHe answered slowly: \"I have seen your portrait. Hah, your portrait!\"\nhe jeered, head flung back and big teeth glinting in the sunlight.\n\"There is a painter who merits crucifixion.\"\n\nShe considered this indicative of a cruel disposition, but also of a\nfine taste in the liberal arts. Aloud she stated:\n\n\"You are not a Frenchman, messire. I do not understand how you can\nhave seen my portrait.\"\n\nThe man stood for a moment twiddling the fox-brush. \"I am a harper, my\nPrincess. I have visited the courts of many kings, though never that\nof France. I perceive I have been woefully unwise.\"\n\nThis trenched upon insolence--the look of his eyes, indeed, carried it\nwell past the frontier,--but she found the statement interesting.\nStraightway she touched the kernel of those fear-blurred legends\nwhispered about Dom Manuel's reputed descendants.\n\n\"You have, then, seen the King of England?\"\n\n\"Yes, Highness.\"\n\n\"Is it true that in him, the devil blood of Oriander has gone mad, and\nthat he eats children--like Agrapard and Angoulaffre of the Broken\nTeeth?\"\n\nHis gaze widened. \"I have heard a deal of scandal concerning the man.\nBut certainly I never heard that.\"\n\nKatharine settled back, luxuriously, in the crotch of the apple-tree.\n\"Tell me about him.\"\n\nComposedly he sat down upon the grass and began to acquaint her with\nhis knowledge and opinions concerning Henry, the fifth of that name to\nreign in England, and the son of that squinting Harry of Derby about\nwhom I have told you so much before.\n\nKatharine punctuated the harper's discourse with eager questionings,\nwhich are not absolutely to our purpose. In the main, this harper\nthought the man now buffeting France a just king, and he had heard,\nwhen the crown was laid aside, Sire Henry was sufficiently jovial, and\neven prankish. The harper educed anecdotes. He considered that the\nKing would manifestly take Rouen, which the insatiable man was now\nbesieging. Was the King in treaty for the hand of the Infanta of\nAragon? Yes, he undoubtedly was.\n\nKatharine sighed her pity for this ill-starred woman. \"And now tell me\nabout yourself.\"\n\nHe was, it appeared, Alain Maquedonnieux, a harper by vocation, and by\nbirth a native of Ireland. Beyond the fact that it was a savage\nkingdom adjoining Cataia, Katharine knew nothing of Ireland. The\nharper assured her that in this she was misinformed, since the kings\nof England claimed Ireland as an appanage, though the Irish themselves\nwere of two minds as to the justice of these pretensions; all in all,\nhe considered that Ireland belonged to Saint Patrick, and that the\nholy man had never accredited a vicar.\n\n\"Doubtless, by the advice of God,\" Alain said: \"for I have read in\nMaster Roger de Wendover's Chronicles of how at the dread day of\njudgment all the Irish are to muster before the high and pious\nPatrick, as their liege lord and father in the spirit, and by him be\nconducted into the presence of God; and of how, by virtue of Saint\nPatrick's request, all the Irish will die seven years to an hour\nbefore the second coming of Christ, in order to give the blessed saint\nsufficient time to marshal his company, which is considerable.\"\nKatharine admitted the convenience of this arrangement, as well as the\nneglect of her education. Alain gazed up at her for a long while, as\nif in reflection, and presently said: \"Doubtless the Lady Heleine of\nArgos also was thus starry-eyed and found in books less diverting\nreading than in the faces of men.\" It flooded Katharine's cheeks with\na livelier hue, but did not vex her irretrievably; if she chose to\nread this man's face, the meaning was plain enough.\n\nI give you the gist of their talk, and that in all conscience is\ntrivial. But it was a day when one entered love's wardship with a\nplunge, not in more modern fashion venturing forward bit by bit, as\nthough love were so much cold water. So they talked for a long while,\nwith laughter mutually provoked and shared, with divers eloquent and\ndangerous pauses. The harper squatted upon the ground, the Princess\nleaned over the wall; but to all intent they sat together upon the\nloftiest turret of Paradise, and it was a full two hours before\nKatharine hinted at departure.\n\nAlain rose, approaching the wall. \"To-morrow I ride for Milan to take\nservice with Duke Filippo. I had broken my journey these three days\npast at Ch\u00e2teauneuf yonder, where this fox has been harrying my host's\nchickens. To-day I went out to slay him, and he led me, his murderer,\nto the fairest lady earth may boast. Do you not think that, in\nreturning good for evil, this fox was a true Christian, my Princess?\"\n\nKatharine said: \"I lament his destruction. Farewell, Messire Alain!\nAnd since chance brought you hither--\"\n\n\"Destiny brought me hither,\" Alain affirmed, a mastering hunger in his\neyes. \"Destiny has been kind; I shall make a prayer to her that she\ncontinue so.\" But when Katharine demanded what this prayer would be,\nAlain shook his tawny head. \"Presently you shall know, Highness, but\nnot now. I return to Ch\u00e2teauneuf on certain necessary businesses;\nto-morrow I set out at cockcrow for Milan and the Visconti's livery.\nFarewell!\" He mounted and rode away in the golden August sunlight, the\nhounds frisking about him. The fox-brush was fastened in his hat. Thus\nTristran de L\u00e9onois may have ridden a-hawking in drowned Cornwall,\nthus statelily and composedly, Katharine thought, gazing after him.\nShe went to her apartments, singing an inane song about the amorous\nand joyful time of spring when everything and everybody is happy,--\n\n  \"El tems amoreus plein de joie,\n  El tems o\u00f9 tote riens s'esgaie,--\"\n\nand burst into a sudden passion of tears. There were born every day,\nshe reflected, such hosts of women-children, who were not princesses,\nand therefore compelled to marry detestable kings.\n\nDawn found her in the orchard. She was to remember that it was a\ncloudy morning, and that mist-tatters trailed from the more distant\ntrees. In the slaty twilight the garden's verdure was lustreless, the\ngrass and foliage were uniformly sombre save where dewdrops showed\nlike beryls. Nowhere in the orchard was there absolute shadow, nowhere\na vista unblurred; in the east, half-way between horizon and zenith,\ntwo belts of coppery light flared against the gray sky like embers\nswaddled by ashes. The birds were waking; there were occasional\nscurryings in tree-tops and outbursts of peevish twittering to attest\nas much; and presently came a singing, less musical than that of many\na bird perhaps, but far more grateful to the girl who heard it, heart\nin mouth. A lute accompanied the song demurely.\n\nSang Alain:\n\n  \"O Madam Destiny, omnipotent,\n  Be not too obdurate to us who pray\n  That this our transient grant of youth be spent\n  In laughter as befits a holiday,\n  From which the evening summons us away,\n  From which to-morrow wakens us to strife\n  And toil and grief and wisdom,--and to-day\n  Grudge us not life!\n\n  \"O Madam Destiny, omnipotent,\n  Why need our elders trouble us at play?\n  We know that very soon we shall repent\n  The idle follies of our holiday,\n  And being old, shall be as wise as they:\n  But now we are not wise, and lute and fife\n  Plead sweetlier than axioms,--so to-day\n  Grudge us not life!\n\n  \"O Madam Destiny, omnipotent,\n  You have given us youth--and must we cast away\n  The cup undrained and our one coin unspent\n  Because our elders' beards and hearts are gray?\n  They have forgotten that if we delay\n  Death claps us on the shoulder, and with knife\n  Or cord or fever flouts the prayer we pray--\n  'Grudge us not life!'\n\n  \"Madam, recall that in the sun we play\n  But for an hour, then have the worm for wife,\n  The tomb for habitation--and to-day\n  Grudge us not life!\"\n\nCandor in these matters is best. Katharine scrambled into the crotch\nof the apple-tree. The dew pattered sharply about her, but the\nPrincess was not in a mood to appraise discomfort.\n\n\"You came!\" this harper said, transfigured; and then again, \"You\ncame!\"\n\nShe breathed, \"Yes.\"\n\nSo for a long time they stood looking at each other. She found\nadoration in his eyes and quailed before it; and in the man's mind not\na grimy and mean incident of the past but marshalled to leer at his\nunworthiness: yet in that primitive garden the first man and woman,\nmeeting, knew no sweeter terror.\n\nIt was by the minstrel that a familiar earth and the grating speech of\nearth were earlier regained. \"The affair is of the suddenest,\" Alain\nobserved, and he now swung the lute behind him. He indicated no\nintention of touching her, though he might easily have done so as he\nsat there exalted by the height of his horse. \"A meteor arrives with\nmore prelude. But Love is an arbitrary lord; desiring my heart, he has\nseized it, and accordingly I would now brave hell to come to you, and\nfinding you there, would esteem hell a pleasure-garden. I have already\nmade my prayer to Destiny that she concede me love. Now of God, our\nFather and Master, I entreat quick death if I am not to win you. For,\nGod willing, I shall come to you again, even if in order to do this I\nhave to split the world like a rotten orange.\"\n\n\"Madness! Oh, brave, sweet madness!\" Katharine said. \"You are a\nminstrel and I am a king's daughter.\"\n\n\"Is it madness? Why, then, I think sane persons are to be\ncommiserated. And indeed I spy in all this some design. Across half\nthe earth I came to you, led by a fox. Hey, God's face!\" Alain swore;\n\"the foxes which Samson, that old sinewy captain, loosed among the\ncorn of heathenry kindled no disputation such as this fox has set\nafoot. That was an affair of standing corn and olives spoilt, a bushel\nor so of disaster; now poised kingdoms topple on the brink of ruin.\nThere will be martial argument shortly if you bid me come again.\"\n\n\"I bid you come,\" said Katharine; and after they had stared at each\nother for a long while, he rode away in silence. It was through a dank\nand tear-flawed world that she stumbled conventward, while out of the\neast the sun came bathed in mists, a watery sun no brighter than a\nsilver coin.\n\nAnd for a month the world seemed no less dreary, but about Michaelmas\nthe Queen-Regent sent for her. At the H\u00f4tel de Saint-Pol matters were\nmuch the same. Katharine found her mother in foul-mouthed rage over\nthe failure of a third attempt to poison the Dauphin of Vienne, as\nQueen Isabeau had previously poisoned her two elder sons; I might here\ntrace out a curious similitude between the Valois and that\ndragon-spawned race which Jason very anciently slew at Colchis, since\nthe world was never at peace so long as any two of them existed. But\nKing Charles greeted his daughter with ampler deference, esteeming her\nto be the wife of Presbyter John, the tyrant of Aethiopia. However,\ningenuity had just suggested card-playing for King Charles' amusement,\nand he paid little attention nowadays to any one save his opponent at\nthis new game.\n\nSo the French King chirped his senile jests over the card-table, while\nthe King of England was besieging the French city of Rouen sedulously\nand without mercy. In late autumn an armament from Ireland joined\nHenry's forces. The Irish fought naked, it was said, with long knives.\nKatharine heard discreditable tales of these Irish, and reflected how\ngross are the exaggerations of rumor.\n\nIn the year of grace 1419, in January, the burgesses of Rouen, having\nconsumed their horses, and finding frogs and rats unpalatable, yielded\nthe town. It was the Queen-Regent who brought the news to Katharine.\n\n\"God is asleep,\" the Queen said; \"and while He nods, the Butcher of\nAgincourt has stolen our good city of Rouen.\" She sat down and\nbreathed heavily. \"Never was any poor woman so pestered as I! The\npuddings to-day were quite uneatable, as you saw for yourself, and on\nSunday the Englishman entered Rouen in great splendor, attended by his\nchief nobles; but the Butcher rode alone, and before him went a page\ncarrying a fox-brush on the point of his lance. I put it to you, is\nthat the contrivance of a sane man? Euh! euh!\" Dame Isabeau squealed\non a sudden; \"you are bruising me.\"\n\nKatharine had gripped her by the shoulder. \"The King of England--a\ntall, fair man? with big teeth? a tiny wen upon his neck--here--and\nwith his left cheek scarred? with blue eyes, very bright, bright as\ntapers?\" She poured out her questions in a torrent, and awaited the\nanswer, seeming not to breathe at all.\n\n\"I believe so,\" the Queen said, \"and they say, too, that he has the\ndamned squint of old Manuel the Redeemer.\"\n\n\"O God!\" said Katharine.\n\n\"Ay, our only hope now. And may God show him no more mercy than has\nthis misbegotten English butcher shown us!\" the good lady desired,\nwith fervor. \"The hog, having won our Normandy, is now advancing on\nParis itself. He repudiated the Aragonish alliance last August; and\nuntil last August he was content with Normandy, they tell us, but now\nhe swears to win all France. The man is a madman, and Scythian\nTamburlaine was more lenient. And I do not believe that in all France\nthere is a cook who understands his business.\" She went away\nwhimpering, and proceeded to get tipsy.\n\nThe Princess remained quite still, as Dame Isabeau had left her; you\nmay see a hare crouch so at sight of the hounds. Finally the girl\nspoke aloud. \"Until last August!\" Katharine said. \"Until last August!\n_Poised kingdoms topple on the brink of ruin, now that you bid me come\nto you again_. And I bade this devil's grandson come to me, as my\nlover!\" Presently she went into her oratory and began to pray.\n\nIn the midst of her invocation she wailed: \"Fool, fool! How could I\nhave thought him less than a king!\"\n\nYou are to imagine her breast thus adrum with remorse and hatred of\nherself, the while that town by town fell before the invader like\ncard-houses. Every rumor of defeat--and the news of some fresh defeat\ncame daily--was her arraignment; impotently she cowered at God's\nknees, knowing herself a murderess, whose infamy was still afoot,\noutpacing her prayers, whose victims were battalions. Tarpeia and\nPisidic\u00e9 and Rahab were her sisters; she hungered in her abasement for\nJudith's nobler guilt.\n\nIn May he came to her. A truce was patched up, and French and English\nmet amicably in a great plain near Meulan. A square space was staked\nout and on three sides boarded in, the fourth side being the river\nSeine. This enclosure the Queen-Regent, Jehan of Burgundy, and\nKatharine entered from the French side. Simultaneously the English\nKing appeared, accompanied by his brothers the Dukes of Clarence and\nGloucester, and followed by the Earl of Warwick. Katharine raised her\neyes with I know not what lingering hope; but it was he, a young Zeus\nnow, triumphant and uneager. In his helmet in place of a plume he wore\na fox-brush spangled with jewels.\n\nThese six entered the tent pitched for the conference--the hanging of\nblue velvet embroidered with fleurs-de-lys of gold blurred before the\ngirl's eyes,--and there the Earl of Warwick embarked upon a sea of\nrhetoric. His French was indifferent, his periods were interminable,\nand his demands exorbitant; in brief, the King of England wanted\nKatharine and most of France, with a reversion at the French King's\ndeath of the entire kingdom. Meanwhile Sire Henry sat in silence, his\neyes glowing.\n\n\"I have come,\" he said, under cover of Warwick's oratory--\"I have come\nagain, my lady.\"\n\nKatharine's gaze flickered over him. \"Liar!\" she said, very softly.\n\"Has God no thunders remaining in His armory that this vile thief\nstill goes unblasted? Would you steal love as well as kingdoms?\"\n\nHis ruddy face was now white. \"I love you, Katharine.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"for I am your pretext. I can well believe,\nmessire, that you love your pretext for theft and murder.\"\n\nNeither spoke after this, and presently the Earl of Warwick having\ncome to his peroration, the matter was adjourned till the next day.\nThe party separated. It was not long before Katharine had informed her\nmother that, God willing, she would never again look upon the King of\nEngland's face uncoffined. Isabeau found her a madwoman. The girl\nswept opposition before her with gusts of demoniacal fury, wept,\nshrieked, tore at her hair, and eventually fell into a sort of\nepileptic seizure; between rage and terror she became a horrid,\nfrenzied beast. I do not dwell upon this, for it is not a condition in\nwhich the comeliest maid shows to advantage. But, for the Valois,\ninsanity always lurked at the next corner, and they knew it; to save\nthe girl's reason the Queen was forced to break off all discussion of\nthe match. Accordingly, the Duke of Burgundy went next day to the\nconference alone. Jehan began with \"ifs,\" and over these flimsy\nbarriers Henry, already fretted by Katharine's scorn, presently\nvaulted to a towering fury.\n\n\"Fair cousin,\" the King said, after a deal of vehement bickering, \"we\nwish you to know that we will have the daughter of your King, and that\nwe will drive both him and you out of this kingdom.\"\n\nThe Duke answered, not without spirit, \"Sire, you are pleased to say\nso; but before you have succeeded in ousting my lord and me from this\nrealm, I am of the opinion that you will be very heartily tired.\"\n\nAt this the King turned on his heel; over his shoulder he flung: \"I am\ntireless; also, I am agile as a fox in the pursuit of my desires. Say\nthat to your Princess.\" Then he went away in a rage.\n\nIt had seemed an approvable business to win love incognito, according\nto the example of many ancient emperors, but in practice he had\ntripped over an ugly outgrowth from the legendary custom. The girl\nhated him, there was no doubt about it; and it was equally certain he\nloved her. Particularly caustic was the reflection that a twitch of\nhis finger would get him Katharine as his wife, for before long the\nQueen-Regent was again attempting secret negotiations to bring this\nabout. Yes, he could get the girl's body by a couple of pen-strokes,\nand had he been older that might have contented him: as it was, what\nhe wanted was to rouse the look her eyes had borne in Chartres orchard\nthat tranquil morning, and this one could not readily secure by\nfiddling with seals and parchments. You see his position: this\nhigh-spirited young man now loved the Princess too utterly to take her\non lip-consent, and this marriage was now his one possible excuse for\nceasing from victorious warfare. So he blustered, and the fighting\nrecommenced; and he slew in a despairing rage, knowing that by every\nmovement of his arm he became to her so much the more detestable.\n\nThen the Vicomte de Montbrison, as you have heard, betrayed France,\nand King Henry began to strip the French realm of provinces as you\npeel the layers from an onion. By the May of the year of grace 1420\nFrance was, and knew herself to be, not beaten but demolished. Only a\nfag-end of the French army lay entrenched at Troyes, where King\nCharles and his court awaited Henry's decision as to the morrow's\naction. If he chose to destroy them root and branch, he could; and\nthey knew such mercy as was in the man to be quite untarnished by\nprevious using. Sire Henry drew up a small force before the city and\nmade no overtures toward either peace or throat-cutting.\n\nThis was the posture of affairs on the evening of the Sunday after\nAscension day, when Katharine sat at cards with her father in his\napartments at the H\u00f4tel de Ville. The King was pursing his lips over\nan alternative play, when somebody began singing below in the\ncourtyard.\n\nSang the voice:\n\n  \"I can find no meaning in life,\n  That have weighed the world,--and it was\n  Abundant with folly, and rife\n  With sorrows brittle as glass,\n  And with joys that flicker and pass\n  Like dreams through a fevered head;\n  And like the dripping of rain\n  In gardens naked and dead\n  Is the obdurate thin refrain\n  Of our youth which is presently dead.\n\n  \"And she whom alone I have loved\n  Looks ever with loathing on me,\n  As one she hath seen disproved\n  And stained with such smirches as be\n  Not ever cleansed utterly;\n  And is both to remember the days\n  When Destiny fixed her name\n  As the theme and the goal of my praise;\n  And my love engenders shame,\n  And I stain what I strive for and praise.\n\n  \"O love, most perfect of all,\n  Just to have known you is well!\n  And it heartens me now to recall\n  That just to have known you is well,\n  And naught else is desirable\n  Save only to do as you willed\n  And to love you my whole life long;--\n  But this heart in me is filled\n  With hunger cruel and strong,\n  And with hunger unfulfilled.\n\n  \"Fond heart, though thy hunger be\n  As a flame that wanders unstilled,\n  There is none more perfect than she!\"\n\nMalise now came into the room, and, without speaking, laid a fox-brush\nbefore the Princess.\n\nKatharine twirled it in her hand, staring at the card-littered table.\n\"So you are in his pay, Malise? I am sorry. But you know that your\nemployer is master here. Who am I to forbid him entrance?\" The girl\nwent away silently, abashed, and the Princess sat quite still, tapping\nthe brush against the table.\n\n\"They do not want me to sign another treaty, do they?\" her father\nasked timidly. \"It appears to me they are always signing treaties, and\nI cannot see that any good comes of it. And I would have won the last\ngame, Katharine, if Malise had not interrupted us. You know I would\nhave won.\"\n\n\"Yes, Father, you would have won. Oh, he must not see you!\" Katharine\ncried, a great tide of love mounting in her breast, the love that\ndraws a mother fiercely to shield her backward boy. \"Father, will you\nnot go into your chamber? I have a new book for you, Father--all\npictures, dear. Come--\" She was coaxing him when Sire Henry appeared\nin the doorway.\n\n\"But I do not wish to look at pictures,\" Charles said, peevishly; \"I\nwish to play cards. You are an ungrateful daughter, Katharine. You are\nnever willing to amuse me.\" He sat down with a whimper and began to\npluck at his dribbling lips.\n\nKatharine had moved a little toward the door. Her face was white. \"Now\nwelcome, sire!\" she said. \"Welcome, O great conqueror, who in your\nhour of triumph can find no nobler recreation than to shame a maid\nwith her past folly! It was valorously done, sire. See, Father; here\nis the King of England come to observe how low we sit that yesterday\nwere lords of France.\"\n\n\"The King of England!\" echoed Charles, and he rose now to his feet. \"I\nthought we were at war with him. But my memory is treacherous. You\nperceive, brother of England, I am planning a new mouse-trap, and my\nmind is somewhat pre\u00ebmpted. I recall now that you are in treaty for my\ndaughter's hand. Katharine is a good girl, a fine upstanding girl, but\nI suppose--\" He paused, as if to regard and hear some invisible\ncounsellor, and then briskly resumed: \"Yes, I suppose policy demands\nthat she should marry you. We trammelled kings can never go free of\npolicy--ey, my comp\u00e8re of England? No; it was through policy I wedded\nher mother; and we have been very unhappy, Isabeau and I. A word in\nyour ear, son-in-law: Madame Isabeau's soul formerly inhabited a sow,\nas Pythagoras teaches, and when our Saviour cast it out at Gadara, the\ninfluence of the moon drew it hither.\"\n\nHenry did not say anything. Steadily his calm blue eyes appraised Dame\nKatharine. And King Charles went on, very knowingly:\n\n\"Oho, these Latinists cannot hoodwink me, you observe, though by\nordinary it chimes with my humor to appear content. Policy again,\nson-in-law: for once roused, I am terrible. To-day in the great\nhall-window, under the bleeding feet of Lazarus, I slew ten flies--\nvery black they were, the black shrivelled souls of parricides,--and\nafterward I wept for it. I often weep; the Mediterranean hath its\nsources in my eyes, for my daughter cheats at cards. Cheats, sir!--and\nI her father!\" The incessant peering, the stealthy cunning with which\nCharles whispered this, the confidence with which he clung to his\ndestroyer's hand, was that of a conspiring child.\n\n\n\"Come, Father,\" Katharine said. \"Come away to bed, dear.\"\n\n\"Hideous basilisk!\" he spat at her; \"dare you rebel against me? Am I\nnot King of France, and is it not blasphemy for a King of France to be\nmocked? Frail moths that flutter about my splendor,\" he shrieked, in\nan unheralded frenzy, \"beware of me, beware! for I am omnipotent! I am\nKing of France, Heaven's regent. At my command the winds go about the\nearth, and nightly the stars are kindled for my recreation. Perhaps I\nam mightier than God, but I do not remember now. The reason is written\ndown and lies somewhere under a bench. Now I sail for England. Eia!\neia! I go to ravage England, terrible and merciless. But I must have\nmy mouse-traps, Goodman Devil, for in England the cats of the\nmiddle-sea wait unfed.\" He went out of the room, giggling, and in the\ncorridor began to sing:\n\n  \"A hundred thousand times good-bye!\n  I go to seek the Evangelist,\n  For here all persons cheat and lie ...\"\n\nAll this while Henry remained immovable, his eyes fixed upon\nKatharine. Thus (she meditated) he stood among Frenchmen; he was the\nboulder, and they the waters that babbled and fretted about him. But\nshe turned and met his gaze squarely. She noted now for the first time\nhow oddly his left eyebrow drooped. Katharine said: \"And that is the\nking whom you have conquered! Is it not a notable conquest to overcome\nso wise a king? to pilfer renown from an idiot? There are cut-throats\nin Troyes, rogues doubly damned, who would scorn the action. Now shall\nI fetch my mother, sire? the commander of that great army which you\novercame? As the hour is late, she is by this time tipsy, but she will\ncome. Or perhaps she is with some paid lover, but if this conqueror,\nthis second Alexander, wills it she will come. O God!\" the girl\nwailed, on a sudden; \"O just and all-seeing God! are not we of Valois\nso contemptible that in conquering us it is the victor who is shamed?\"\n\n\"Flower of the marsh!\" he said, and his voice pulsed with tender\ncadences--\"flower of the marsh! it is not the King of England who now\ncomes to you, but Alain the harper. Henry Plantagenet God has led\nhither by the hand to punish the sins of this realm, and to reign in\nit like a true king. Henry Plantagenet will cast out the Valois from\nthe throne they have defiled, as Darius cast out Belshazzar, for such\nis the desire and the intent of God. But to you comes Alain the\nharper, not as a conqueror but as a suppliant,--Alain who has loved\nyou whole-heartedly these two years past, and who now kneels before\nyou entreating grace.\"\n\nKatharine looked down into his countenance, for to his speech he had\nfitted action. Suddenly and for the first time she understood that he\nbelieved France to be his by Divine favor and Heaven's peculiar\nintervention. He thought himself God's factor, not His rebel. He was\nrather stupid, this huge, handsome, squinting boy; and as she\ncomprehended this, her hand went to his shoulder, half maternally.\n\n\"It is nobly done, sire. But I understand. You must marry me in order\nto uphold your claim to France. You sell, and I with my body purchase,\npeace for France. There is no need of a lover's posture when hucksters\nmeet.\"\n\n\"So changed!\" he said, and he was silent for an interval, still\nkneeling. Then he began: \"You force me to point out that I do not need\nany pretext for holding France. France lies before me prostrate. By\nGod's singular grace I reign in this fair kingdom, mine by right of\nconquest, and an alliance with the house of Valois will neither make\nnor mar me.\" She was unable to deny this, unpalatable as was the fact.\n\"But I love you, and therefore as man wooes woman I sue to you. Do you\nnot understand that there can be between us no question of expediency?\nKatharine, in Chartres orchard there met a man and a maid we know of;\nnow in Troyes they meet again,--not as princess and king, but as man\nand maid, the wooer and the wooed. Once I touched your heart, I think.\nAnd now in all the world there is one thing I covet--to gain for the\npoor king some portion of that love you would have squandered on the\nharper.\" His hand closed upon her hand.\n\nAt his touch the girl's composure vanished. \"My lord, you woo too\ntimidly for one who comes with many loud-voiced advocates. I am\ndaughter to the King of France, and next to my soul's salvation I\nesteem the welfare of France. Can I, then, fail to love the King of\nEngland, who chooses the blood of my countrymen as a judicious garb to\ncome a-wooing in? How else, since you have ravaged my native land,\nsince you have besmirched the name I bear, since yonder afield every\nwound in my dead and yet unburied Frenchmen is to me a mouth which\nshrieks your infamy?\"\n\nHe rose. \"And yet, for all that, you love me.\"\n\nShe could not at the first effort find words with which to answer him,\nbut presently she said, quite simply, \"To see you lying in your coffin\nI would willingly give up my hope of heaven, for heaven can afford no\nsight more desirable.\"\n\n\"You loved Alain.\"\n\n\"I loved the husk of a man. You can never comprehend how utterly I\nloved him.\"\n\n\"You are stubborn. I shall have trouble with you. But this notion of\nyours is plainly a mistaken notion. That you love me is indisputable,\nand this I propose to demonstrate. You will observe that I am quite\nunarmed except for this dagger, which I now throw out of the\nwindow--\" with the word it jangled in the courtyard below. \"I am in\nTroyes alone among some thousand Frenchmen, any one of whom would\nwillingly give his life for the privilege of taking mine. You have but\nto sound the gong beside you, and in a few moments I shall be a dead\nman. Strike, then! For with me dies the English power in France.\nStrike, Katharine! If you see in me but the King of England.\"\n\nShe was rigid; and his heart leapt when he saw it was because of\nterror.\n\n\"You came alone! You dared!\"\n\nHe answered, with a wonderful smile, \"Proud spirit! How else might I\nconquer you?\"\n\n\"You have not conquered!\" Katharine lifted the baton beside the gong,\npoising it. God had granted her prayer--to save France. Now the past\nand the ignominy of the past might be merged in Judith's nobler guilt.\nBut I must tell you that in the supreme hour, Destiny at her beck, her\nmain desire was to slap the man for his childishness. Oh, he had no\nright thus to besot himself with adoration! This dejection at her feet\nof his high destiny awed her, and pricked her, too, with her inability\nto understand him. Angrily she flung away the baton. \"Go! Ah, go!\" she\ncried, like one strangling. \"There has been enough of bloodshed, and I\nmust spare you, loathing you as I do, for I cannot with my own hand\nmurder you.\"\n\nBut the King was a kindly tyrant, crushing independence from his\nassociates as lesser folk squeeze water from a sponge. \"I cannot go\nthus. Acknowledge me to be Alain, the man you love, or else strike\nupon the gong.\"\n\n\"You are cruel!\" she wailed, in her torture.\n\n\"Yes, I am cruel.\"\n\nKatharine raised straining arms above her head in a hard gesture of\ndespair. \"You have conquered. You know that I love you. Oh, if I could\nfind words to voice my shame, to shriek it in your face, I could\nbetter endure it! For I love you. With all my body and heart and soul\nI love you. Mine is the agony, for I love you! and presently I shall\nstand quite still and see little Frenchmen scramble about you as\nhounds leap about a stag, and afterward kill you. And after that I\nshall live! I preserve France, but after I have slain you, Henry, I\nmust live. Mine is the agony, the enduring agony.\" She stayed\nmotionless for an interval. \"God, God! Let me not fail!\" Katharine\nbreathed; and then: \"O fair sweet friend, I am about to commit a vile\naction, but it is for the sake of the France that I love next to God.\nAs Judith gave her body to Holofernes, I crucify my heart for the\npreservation of France.\" Very calmly she struck upon the gong.\n\nIf she could have found any reproach in his eyes during the ensuing\nsilence, she could have borne it; but there was only love. And with\nall that, he smiled like one who knew the upshot of this matter.\n\nA man-at-arms came into the room. \"Germain--\" said Katharine, and then\nagain, \"Germain--\" She gave a swallowing motion and was silent. When\nshe spoke it was with crisp distinctness. \"Germain, fetch a harp.\nMessire Alain here is about to play for me.\"\n\nAt the man's departure she said: \"I am very pitiably weak. Need you\nhave dragged my soul, too, in the dust? God heard my prayer, and you\nhave forced me to deny His favor, as Peter denied Christ. My dear, be\nvery kind to me, for I come to you naked of honor.\" She fell at the\nKing's feet, embracing his knees. \"My master, be very kind to me, for\nthere remains only your love.\"\n\nHe raised her to his breast. \"Love is enough,\" he said.\n\nShe was conscious, as he held her thus, of the chain mail under his\njerkin. He had come armed; he had his soldiers no doubt in the\ncorridor; he had tricked her, it might be from the first. But that did\nnot matter now.\n\n\"Love is enough,\" she told her master docilely.\n\nNext day the English entered Troyes and in the cathedral church these\ntwo were betrothed. Henry was there magnificent in a curious suit of\nburnished armor; in place of his helmet-plume he wore a fox-brush\nornamented with jewels, which unusual ornament afforded great matter\nof remark among the busybodies of both armies.\n\nTHE END OF THE TENTH NOVEL\n\n\n\n\nTHE EPILOGUE\n\n\n  \"Et je fais s\u00e7avoir \u00e0 tous lecteurs de ce Livret que les choses que\n  je dis avoir vues et sues sont enregistr\u00e9s icy, afin que vous pouviez\n  les regarder selon vostre bon sens, s'il vous plaist.\"\n\nHERE IS APPENDED THE EPILOGUE THAT MESSIRE NICOLAS DE CAEN AFFIXED TO\nTHE BOOK WHICH HE HAD MADE ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY; AND\nWHICH (IN CONSEQUENCE) HE DARED NOT APPRAISE.\n\n\n\n\n_The Epilogue_\n\n\n_A Son Livret_\n\n\nIntrepidly depart, my little book, into the presence of that most\nillustrious lady who bade me compile you. Bow down before her\njudgment. And if her sentence be that of a fiery death, I counsel you\nnot to grieve at what cannot be avoided.\n\nBut, if by any miracle that glorious, strong fortress of the weak\nconsider it advisable that you remain unburned, pass thence, my little\nbook, to every man who may desire to purchase you, and live out your\nlittle hour among these very credulous persons; and at your appointed\nseason perish and be forgotten. Thus may you share your betters' fate,\nand be at one with those famed comedies of Greek Menander and all the\npoignant songs of Sappho. _Et quid Pandoniae_--thus, little book, I\ncharge you to poultice your more-merited oblivion--_quid Pandoniae\nrestat nisi nomen Athenae?_\n\nYet even in your brief existence you may chance to meet with those who\nwill affirm that the stories you narrate are not true and protest\nassertions which are only fables. To these you will reply that I, your\nmaker, was in my youth the quite unworthy servant of the most high and\nnoble lady, Dame Jehane, and in this period, at and about her house of\nHavering-Bower, conversed in my own person with Dame Katharine, then\nhappily remarried to a private gentleman of Wales; and so obtained the\nmatter of the ninth story and of the tenth authentically. You will say\nalso that Messire de Montbrison afforded me the main matter of the\nsixth and seventh stories, and many of the songs which this book\ncontains; and that, moreover, I once journeyed to Caer Idion and\ntalked for some two hours with Richard Holland (whom I found a very\nold and garrulous and cheery person), and got of him the matter of the\neighth tale in this dizain, together with much information as concerns\nthe sixth and the seventh. And you will add that the matter of the\nfourth and fifth tales was in every detail related to me by my most\nillustrious mistress, Madame Isabella of Portugal, who had this\ninformation from her mother, an equally veracious and immaculate lady,\nand one that was in youth Dame Philippa's most dear associate. For the\nrest you must admit, unwillingly, the first three stories in this book\nto be a thought less solidly confirmed; although (as you will say)\neven in these histories I have not ever deviated from what was at odd\ntimes narrated to me by the aforementioned persons, and have always\nendeavored honestly to piece together that which they told me.\n\nI have pieced together these tales about the women who intermarried,\nnot very enviably, with the demon-tainted blood of Edward Longshanks,\nbecause it seems to me that these tales, when they are rightly\nconsidered, compose the initial portion of a troubling history.\nWhether (as some declare) the taint came from Manuel of Poictesme, or\nwhether (as yet others say) this poison was inherited from the demon\nwife whom Foulques Plantagenet fetched out of hell, the blood in these\nmen was not all human. These men might not tread equally with human\nbeings: their wives suffered therefor, just as they that had inherited\nthis blood suffered therefor, and all England suffered therefor. And\nthe upshot of it I have narrated elsewhere, in the book called and\nentitled _The Red Cuckold_, which composes the final portion of this\nhistory, and tells of the last spilling and of the extinction of this\nblood.\n\nAlso, my little book, you will encounter more malignant people who\nwill jeer at you, and will say that you and I have cheated them of\nyour purchase-money. To these you will reply, with Plutarch, _Non mi\naurum posco, nec mi pretium_. Secondly you will say that, of\nnecessity, the tailor cuts the coat according to his cloth; and that\nhe cannot undertake to robe an Ephialtes or a towering Orion suitably\nwhen the resources of his shop amount to only a few yards of cambric.\nIndeed had I the power to make you better, my little book, I would\nhave exercised that power to the utmost. A good conscience is a\ncontinual feast, and I summon high Heaven to be my witness that had I\nbeen Homer you had awed the world, another Iliad. I lament your\ninability to do this, as heartily as any person living; yet Heaven\nwilled it; and it is in consequence to Heaven these aforementioned\ncavillers should rightfully complain.\n\nSo to such impious people do you make no answer at all, unless indeed\nyou should elect to answer them by repetition of this song which I now\nmake for you, my little book, at your departure from me. And the song\nruns in this fashion:\n\n  Depart, depart, my book! and live and die\n  Dependent on the idle fantasy\n  Of men who cannot view you, quite, as I.\n\n  For I am fond, and willingly mistake\n  My book to be the book I meant to make,\n  And cannot judge you, for that phantom's sake.\n\n  Yet pardon me if I have wrought too ill\n  In making you, that never spared the will\n  To shape you perfectly, and lacked the skill.\n\n  Ah, had I but the power, my book, then I\n  Had wrought in you some wizardry so high\n  That no man but had listened ...\n\n  They pass by,\n  And shrug--as we, who know that unto us\n  It has been granted never to fare thus,\n  And never to be strong and glorious.\n\n  Is it denied me to perpetuate\n  What so much loving labor did create?--\n  I hear Oblivion tap upon the gate,\n  And acquiesce, not all disconsolate.\n\n  For I have got such recompense\n  Of that high-hearted excellence\n  Which the contented craftsman knows,\n  Alone, that to loved labor goes,\n  And daily does the work he chose,\n  And counts all else impertinence!\n\nEXPLICIT DECAS REGINARUM\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHIVALRY***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 11752-8.txt or 11752-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/7/5/11752\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
