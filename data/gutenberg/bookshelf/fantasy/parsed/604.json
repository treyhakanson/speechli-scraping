Dare I say that I, a plain, prosaic lieutenant in the\nrepublican service have done the incredible things here set out for the\nlove of a woman--for a chimera in female shape; for a pale, vapid ghost\nof woman-loveliness?  At times I tell myself I dare not: that you will\nlaugh, and cast me aside as a fabricator; and then again I pick up my\npen and collect the scattered pages, for I MUST write it--the pallid\nsplendour of that thing I loved, and won, and lost is ever before me,\nand will not be forgotten.  The tumult of the struggle into which that\nvision led me still throbs in my mind, the soft, lisping voices of the\nplanet I ransacked for its sake and the roar of the destruction which\nfollowed me back from the quest drowns all other sounds in my ears! I\nmust and will write--it relieves me; read and believe as you list.\n\nAt the moment this story commences I was thinking of grilled steak and\ntomatoes--steak crisp and brown on both sides, and tomatoes red as a\nsetting sun!\n\nMuch else though I have forgotten, THAT fact remains as clear as the\nlast sight of a well-remembered shore in the mind of some wave-tossed\ntraveller.  And the occasion which produced that prosaic thought was a\nnight well calculated to make one think of supper and fireside, though\nthe one might be frugal and the other lonely, and as I, Gulliver Jones,\nthe poor foresaid Navy lieutenant, with the honoured stars of our\nRepublic on my collar, and an undeserved snub from those in authority\nrankling in my heart, picked my way homeward by a short cut through the\ndismalness of a New York slum I longed for steak and stout, slippers\nand a pipe, with all the pathetic keenness of a troubled soul.\n\nIt was a wild, black kind of night, and the weirdness of it showed up\nas I passed from light to light or crossed the mouths of dim alleys\nleading Heaven knows to what infernal dens of mystery and crime even in\nthis latter-day city of ours.  The moon was up as far as the church\nsteeples; large vapoury clouds scudding across the sky between us and\nher, and a strong, gusty wind, laden with big raindrops snarled angrily\nround corners and sighed in the parapets like strange voices talking\nabout things not of human interest.\n\nIt made no difference to me, of course.  New York in this year of grace\nis not the place for the supernatural be the time never so fit for\nwitch-riding and the night wind in the chimney-stacks sound never so\nmuch like the last gurgling cries of throttled men.  No! the world was\nvery matter-of-fact, and particularly so to me, a poor younger son with\nfive dollars in my purse by way of fortune, a packet of unpaid bills in\nmy breastpocket, and round my neck a locket with a portrait therein of\nthat dear buxom, freckled, stub-nosed girl away in a little southern\nseaport town whom I thought I loved with a magnificent affection.\nGods! I had not even touched the fringe of that affliction.\n\nThus sauntering along moodily, my chin on my chest and much too\nabsorbed in reflection to have any nice appreciation of what was\nhappening about me, I was crossing in front of a dilapidated block of\nhouses, dating back nearly to the time of the Pilgrim Fathers, when I\nhad a vague consciousness of something dark suddenly sweeping by me--a\nthing like a huge bat, or a solid shadow, if such a thing could be, and\nthe next instant there was a thud and a bump, a bump again, a\nhalf-stifled cry, and then a hurried vision of some black carpeting\nthat flapped and shook as though all the winds of Eblis were in its\nfolds, and then apparently disgorged from its inmost recesses a little\nman.\n\nBefore my first start of half-amused surprise was over I saw him by the\nflickering lamp-light clutch at space as he tried to steady himself,\nstumble on the slippery curb, and the next moment go down on the back\nof his head with a most ugly thud.\n\nNow I was not destitute of feeling, though it had been my lot to see\nmen die in many ways, and I ran over to that motionless form without an\nidea that anything but an ordinary accident had occurred.  There he\nlay, silent and, as it turned out afterwards, dead as a door-nail, the\nstrangest old fellow ever eyes looked upon, dressed in shabby\nsorrel-coloured clothes of antique cut, with a long grey beard upon his\nchin, pent-roof eyebrows, and a wizened complexion so puckered and\ntanned by exposure to Heaven only knew what weathers that it was\nimpossible to guess his nationality.\n\nI lifted him up out of the puddle of black blood in which he was lying,\nand his head dropped back over my arm as though it had been fixed to\nhis body with string alone.  There was neither heart-beat nor breath in\nhim, and the last flicker of life faded out of that gaunt face even as\nI watched.  It was not altogether a pleasant situation, and the only\nthing to do appeared to be to get the dead man into proper care (though\nlittle good it could do him now!)  as speedily as possible.  So,\nsending a chance passer-by into the main street for a cab, I placed him\ninto it as soon as it came, and there being nobody else to go, got in\nwith him myself, telling the driver at the same time to take us to the\nnearest hospital.\n\n\"Is this your rug, captain?\" asked a bystander just as we were driving\noff.\n\n\"Not mine,\" I answered somewhat roughly.  \"You don't suppose I go about\nat this time of night with Turkey carpets under my arm, do you? It\nbelongs to this old chap here who has just dropped out of the skies on\nto his head; chuck it on top and shut the door!\"  And that rug, the\nvery mainspring of the startling things which followed, was thus\ncarelessly thrown on to the carriage, and off we went.\n\nWell, to be brief, I handed in that stark old traveller from nowhere at\nthe hospital, and as a matter of curiosity sat in the waiting-room\nwhile they examined him.  In five minutes the house-surgeon on duty\ncame in to see me, and with a shake of his head said briefly--\n\n\"Gone, sir--clean gone!  Broke his neck like a pipe-stem.  Most\nstrange-looking man, and none of us can even guess at his age.  Not a\nfriend of yours, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever to do with me, sir.  He slipped on the pavement and\nfell in front of me just now, and as a matter of common charity I\nbrought him in here.  Were there any means of identification on him?\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" answered the doctor, taking out his notebook and, as a\nmatter of form, writing down my name and address and a few brief\nparticulars, \"nothing whatever except this curious-looking bead hung\nround his neck by a blackened thong of leather,\" and he handed me a\nthing about as big as a filbert nut with a loop for suspension and\napparently of rock crystal, though so begrimed and dull its nature was\ndifficult to speak of with certainty.  The bead was of no seeming value\nand slipped unintentionally into my waistcoat pocket as I chatted for a\nfew minutes more with the doctor, and then, shaking hands, I said\ngoodbye, and went back to the cab which was still waiting outside.\n\nIt was only on reaching home I noticed the hospital porters had omitted\nto take the dead man's carpet from the roof of the cab when they\ncarried him in, and as the cabman did not care about driving back to\nthe hospital with it, and it could not well be left in the street, I\nsomewhat reluctantly carried it indoors with me.\n\nOnce in the shine of my own lamp and a cigar in my mouth I had a closer\nlook at that ancient piece of art work from heaven, or the other place,\nonly knows what ancient loom.\n\nA big, strong rug of faded Oriental colouring, it covered half the\nfloor of my sitting-room, the substance being of a material more like\ncamel's hair than anything else, and running across, when examined\nclosely, were some dark fibres so long and fine that surely they must\nhave come from the tail of Solomon's favourite black stallion itself.\nBut the strangest thing about that carpet was its pattern.  It was\nthreadbare enough to all conscience in places, yet the design still\nlived in solemn, age-wasted hues, and, as I dragged it to my\nstove-front and spread it out, it seemed to me that it was as much like\na star map done by a scribe who had lately recovered from delirium\ntremens as anything else. In the centre appeared a round such as might\nbe taken for the sun, while here and there, \"in the field,\" as heralds\nsay, were lesser orbs which from their size and position could\nrepresent smaller worlds circling about it.  Between these orbs were\ndotted lines and arrow-heads of the oldest form pointing in all\ndirections, while all the intervening spaces were filled up with woven\ncharacters half-way in appearance between Runes and Cryptic-Sanskrit.\nRound the borders these characters ran into a wild maze, a perfect\njungle of an alphabet through which none but a wizard could have forced\na way in search of meaning.\n\nAltogether, I thought as I kicked it out straight upon my floor, it was\na strange and not unhandsome article of furniture--it would do nicely\nfor the mess-room on the Carolina, and if any representatives of yonder\npoor old fellow turned up tomorrow, why, I would give them a couple of\ndollars for it.  Little did I guess how dear it would be at any price!\n\nMeanwhile that steak was late, and now that the temporary excitement of\nthe evening was wearing off I fell dull again.  What a dark, sodden\nworld it was that frowned in on me as I moved over to the window and\nopened it for the benefit of the cool air, and how the wind howled\nabout the roof tops.  How lonely I was!  What a fool I had been to ask\nfor long leave and come ashore like this, to curry favour with a set of\nstubborn dunderheads who cared nothing for me--or Polly, and could not\nor would not understand how important it was to the best interests of\nthe Service that I should get that promotion which alone would send me\nback to her an eligible wooer!  What a fool I was not to have\nvolunteered for some desperate service instead of wasting time like\nthis!  Then at least life would have been interesting; now it was dull\nas ditch-water, with wretched vistas of stagnant waiting between now\nand that joyful day when I could claim that dear, rosy-checked girl for\nmy own.  What a fool I had been!\n\n\"I wish, I wish,\" I exclaimed, walking round the little room, \"I wish I\nwere--\"\n\nWhile these unfinished exclamations were actually passing my lips I\nchanced to cross that infernal mat, and it is no more startling than\ntrue, but at my word a quiver of expectation ran through that gaunt\nweb--a rustle of anticipation filled its ancient fabric, and one frayed\ncorner surged up, and as I passed off its surface in my stride, the\nsentence still unfinished on my lips, wrapped itself about my left leg\nwith extraordinary swiftness and so effectively that I nearly fell into\nthe arms of my landlady, who opened the door at the moment and came in\nwith a tray and the steak and tomatoes mentioned more than once already.\n\nIt was the draught caused by the opening door, of course, that had made\nthe dead man's rug lift so strangely--what else could it have been? I\nmade this apology to the good woman, and when she had set the table and\nclosed the door took another turn or two about my den, continuing as I\ndid so my angry thoughts.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said at last, returning to the stove and taking my stand,\nhands in pockets, in front of it, \"anything were better than this, any\nenterprise however wild, any adventure however desperate.  Oh, I wish I\nwere anywhere but here, anywhere out of this redtape-ridden world of\nours! I WISH I WERE IN THE PLANET MARS!\"\n\nHow can I describe what followed those luckless words?  Even as I spoke\nthe magic carpet quivered responsively under my feet, and an undulation\nwent all round the fringe as though a sudden wind were shaking it. It\nhumped up in the middle so abruptly that I came down sitting with a\nshock that numbed me for the moment.  It threw me on my back and\nbillowed up round me as though I were in the trough of a stormy sea.\nQuicker than I can write it lapped a corner over and rolled me in its\nfolds like a chrysalis in a cocoon.  I gave a wild yell and made one\nfrantic struggle, but it was too late.  With the leathery strength of a\ngiant and the swiftness of an accomplished cigar-roller covering a\n\"core\" with leaf, it swamped my efforts, straightened my limbs, rolled\nme over, lapped me in fold after fold till head and feet and everything\nwere gone--crushed life and breath back into my innermost being, and\nthen, with the last particle of consciousness, I felt myself lifted\nfrom the floor, pass once round the room, and finally shoot out, point\nforemost, into space through the open window, and go up and up and up\nwith a sound of rending atmospheres that seemed to tear like riven silk\nin one prolonged shriek under my head, and to close up in thunder\nastern until my reeling senses could stand it no longer, and time and\nspace and circumstances all lost their meaning to me.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHow long that wild rush lasted I have no means of judging.  It may have\nbeen an hour, a day, or many days, for I was throughout in a state of\nsuspended animation, but presently my senses began to return and with\nthem a sensation of lessening speed, a grateful relief to a heavy\npressure which had held my life crushed in its grasp, without\ndestroying it completely.  It was just that sort of sensation though\nmore keen which, drowsy in his bunk, a traveller feels when he is\naware, without special perception, harbour is reached and a voyage\ncomes to an end.  But in my case the slowing down was for a long time\ncomparative. Yet the sensation served to revive my scattered senses,\nand just as I was awakening to a lively sense of amazement, an\nincredible doubt of my own emotions, and an eager desire to know what\nhad happened, my strange conveyance oscillated once or twice, undulated\nlightly up and down, like a woodpecker flying from tree to tree, and\nthen grounded, bows first, rolled over several times, then steadied\nagain, and, coming at last to rest, the next minute the infernal rug\nopened, quivering along all its borders in its peculiar way, and\nhumping up in the middle shot me five feet into the air like a cat\ntossed from a schoolboy's blanket.\n\nAs I turned over I had a dim vision of a clear light like the shine of\ndawn, and solid ground sloping away below me.  Upon that slope was\nranged a crowd of squatting people, and a staid-looking individual with\nhis back turned stood nearer by.  Afterwards I found he was lecturing\nall those sitters on the ethics of gravity and the inherent properties\nof falling bodies; at the moment I only knew he was directly in my line\nas I descended, and him round the waist I seized, giddy with the light\nand fresh air, waltzed him down the slope with the force of my impetus,\nand, tripping at the bottom, rolled over and over recklessly with him\nsheer into the arms of the gaping crowd below.  Over and over we went\ninto the thickest mass of bodies, making a way through the people,\nuntil at last we came to a stop in a perfect mound of writhing forms\nand waving legs and arms.  When we had done the mass disentangled\nitself and I was able to raise my head from the shoulder of someone on\nwhom I had fallen, lifting him, or her--which was it?--into a sitting\nposture alongside of me at the same time, while the others rose about\nus like wheat-stalks after a storm, and edged shyly off, as well as\nthey might.\n\nSuch a sleek, slim youth it was who sat up facing me, with a flush of\ngentle surprise on his face, and dapper hands that felt cautiously\nabout his anatomy for injured places.  He looked so quaintly rueful yet\nwithal so good-tempered that I could not help bursting into laughter in\nspite of my own amazement.  Then he laughed too, a sedate, musical\nchuckle, and said something incomprehensible, pointing at the same time\nto a cut upon my finger that was bleeding a little.  I shook my head,\nmeaning thereby that it was nothing, but the stranger with graceful\nsolicitude took my hand, and, after examining the hurt, deliberately\ntore a strip of cloth from a bright yellow toga-like garment he was\nwearing and bound the place up with a woman's tenderness.\n\nMeanwhile, as he ministered, there was time to look about me.  Where\nwas I?  It was not the Broadway; it was not Staten Island on a Saturday\nafternoon.  The night was just over, and the sun on the point of\nrising. Yet it was still shadowy all about, the air being marvellously\ntepid and pleasant to the senses.  Quaint, soft aromas like the breath\nof a new world--the fragrance of unknown flowers, and the dewy scent of\nnever-trodden fields drifted to my nostrils; and to my ears came a\nsound of laughter scarcely more human than the murmur of the wind in\nthe trees, and a pretty undulating whisper as though a great concourse\nof people were talking softly in their sleep.  I gazed about scarcely\nknowing how much of my senses or surroundings were real and how much\nfanciful, until I presently became aware the rosy twilight was\nbroadening into day, and under the increasing shine a strange scene was\nfashioning itself.\n\nAt first it was an opal sea I looked on of mist, shot along its upper\nsurface with the rosy gold and pinks of dawn.  Then, as that soft,\ntranslucent lake ebbed, jutting hills came through it, black and\ncrimson, and as they seemed to mount into the air other lower hills\nshowed through the veil with rounded forest knobs till at last the\nbrightening day dispelled the mist, and as the rosy-coloured gauzy\nfragments went slowly floating away a wonderfully fair country lay at\nmy feet, with a broad sea glimmering in many arms and bays in the\ndistance beyond. It was all dim and unreal at first, the mountains\nshadowy, the ocean unreal, the flowery fields between it and me vacant\nand shadowy.\n\nYet were they vacant?  As my eyes cleared and day brightened still\nmore, and I turned my head this way and that, it presently dawned upon\nme all the meadow coppices and terraces northwards of where I lay, all\nthat blue and spacious ground I had thought to be bare and vacant, were\nalive with a teeming city of booths and tents; now I came to look more\nclosely there was a whole town upon the slope, built as might be in a\nnight of boughs and branches still unwithered, the streets and ways of\nthat city in the shadows thronged with expectant people moving in\ngroups and shifting to and fro in lively streams--chatting at the\nstalls and clustering round the tent doors in soft, gauzy,\nparti-coloured crowds in a way both fascinating and  perplexing.\n\nI stared about me like a child at its first pantomime, dimly\nunderstanding all I saw was novel, but more allured to the colour and\nlife of the picture than concerned with its exact meaning; and while I\nstared and turned my finger was bandaged, and my new friend had been\nlisping away to me without getting anything in turn but a shake of the\nhead. This made him thoughtful, and thereon followed a curious incident\nwhich I cannot explain.  I doubt even whether you will believe it; but\nwhat am I to do in that case?  You have already accepted the episode of\nmy coming, or you would have shut the covers before arriving at this\npage of my modest narrative, and this emboldens me.  I may strengthen\nmy claim on your credulity by pointing out the extraordinary marvels\nwhich science is teaching you even on our own little world.  To quote a\nsingle instance: If any one had declared ten years ago that it would\nshortly be practicable and easy for two persons to converse from shore\nto shore across the Atlantic without any intervening medium, he would\nhave been laughed at as a possibly amusing but certainly extravagant\nromancer. Yet that picturesque lie of yesterday is amongst the\naccomplished facts of today!  Therefore I am encouraged to ask your\nindulgence, in the name of your previous errors, for the following and\nany other instances in which I may appear to trifle with strict\nveracity.  There is no such thing as the impossible in our universe!\n\nWhen my friendly companion found I could not understand him, he looked\nserious for a minute or two, then shortened his brilliant yellow toga,\nas though he had arrived at some resolve, and knelt down directly in\nfront of me.  He next took my face between his hands, and putting his\nnose within an inch of mine, stared into my eyes with all his might.\nAt first I was inclined to laugh, but before long the most curious\nsensations took hold of me.  They commenced with a thrill which passed\nall up my body, and next all feeling save the consciousness of the loud\nbeating of my heart ceased.  Then it seemed that boy's eyes were inside\nmy head and not outside, while along with them an intangible something\npervaded my brain. The sensation at first was like the application of\nether to the skin--a cool, numbing emotion.  It was followed by a\ncurious tingling feeling, as some dormant cells in my mind answered to\nthe thought-transfer, and were filled and fertilised!  My other\nbrain-cells most distinctly felt the vitalising of their companions,\nand for about a minute I experienced extreme nausea and a headache such\nas comes from over-study, though both passed swiftly off.  I presume\nthat in the future we shall all obtain knowledge in this way.  The\nProfessors of a later day will perhaps keep shops for the sale of\nmiscellaneous information, and we shall drop in and be inflated with\nlearning just as the bicyclist gets his tire pumped up, or the motorist\nis recharged with electricity at so much per unit. Examinations will\nthen become matters of capacity in the real meaning of that word, and\nwe shall be tempted to invest our pocket-money by advertisements of \"A\ncheap line in Astrology,\" \"Try our double-strength, two-minute course\nof Classics,\" \"This is remnant day for Trigonometry and Metaphysics,\"\nand so on.\n\nMy friend did not get as far as that.  With him the process did not\ntake more than a minute, but it was startling in its results, and\nreduced me to an extraordinary state of hypnotic receptibility.  When\nit was over my instructor tapped with a finger on my lips, uttering\naloud as he did so the words--\n\n\"Know none; know some; know little; know morel\" again and again; and\nthe strangest part of it is that as he spoke I did know at first a\nlittle, then more, and still more, by swift accumulation, of his speech\nand meaning.  In fact, when presently he suddenly laid a hand over my\neyes and then let go of my head with a pleasantly put question as to\nhow I felt, I had no difficulty whatever in answering him in his own\ntongue, and rose from the ground as one gets from a hair-dresser's\nchair, with a vague idea of looking round for my hat and offering him\nhis fee.\n\n\"My word, sir!\" I said, in lisping Martian, as I pulled down my cuffs\nand put my cravat straight, \"that was a quick process.  I once heard of\na man who learnt a language in the moments he gave each day to having\nhis boots blacked; but this beats all.  I trust I was a docile pupil?\"\n\n\"Oh, fairly, sir,\" answered the soft, musical voice of the strange\nbeing by me; \"but your head is thick and your brain tough.  I could\nhave taught another in half the time.\"\n\n\"Curiously enough,\" was my response, \"those are almost the very words\nwith which my dear old tutor dismissed me the morning I left college.\nNever mind, the thing is done.  Shall I pay you anything?\"\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Any honorarium, then?  Some people understand one word and not the\nother.\"  But the boy only shook his head in answer.\n\nStrangely enough, I was not greatly surprised all this time either at\nthe novelty of my whereabouts or at the hypnotic instruction in a new\nlanguage just received.  Perhaps it was because my head still spun too\ngiddily with that flight in the old rug for much thought; perhaps\nbecause I did not yet fully realise the thing that had happened.  But,\nanyhow, there is the fact, which, like so many others in my narrative,\nmust, alas! remain unexplained for the moment.  The rug, by the way,\nhad completely disappeared, my friend comforting me on this score,\nhowever, by saying he had seen it rolled up and taken away by one whom\nhe knew.\n\n\"We are very tidy people here, stranger,\" he said, \"and everything\nfound Lying about goes back to the Palace store-rooms.  You will laugh\nto see the lumber there, for few of us ever take the trouble to reclaim\nour property.\"\n\nHeaven knows I was in no laughing mood when I saw that enchanted web\nagain!\n\nWhen I had lain and watched the brightening scene for a time, I got up,\nand having stretched and shaken my clothes into some sort of order, we\nstrolled down the hill and joined the light-hearted crowds that twined\nacross the plain and through the streets of their city of booths. They\nwere the prettiest, daintiest folk ever eyes looked upon, well-formed\nand like to us as could be in the main, but slender and willowy, so\ndainty and light, both the men and the women, so pretty of cheek and\nhair, so mild of aspect, I felt, as I strode amongst them, I could have\nplucked them like flowers and bound them up in bunches with my belt.\nAnd yet somehow I liked them from the first minute; such a happy,\ncareless, light-hearted race, again I say, never was seen before. There\nwas not a stain of thought or care on a single one of those white\nforeheads that eddied round me under their peaked, blossom-like caps,\nthe perpetual smile their faces wore never suffered rebuke anywhere;\ntheir very movements were graceful and slow, their laughter was low and\nmusical, there was an odour of friendly, slothful happiness about them\nthat made me admire whether I would or no.\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to live on laughter, as they appeared to\nbe, so presently turning to my acquaintance, who had told me his name\nwas the plain monosyllabic An, and clapping my hand on his shoulder as\nhe stood lost in sleepy reflection, said, in a good, hearty way,\n\"Hullo, friend Yellow-jerkin!  If a stranger might set himself athwart\nthe cheerful current of your meditations, may such a one ask how far\n'tis to the nearest wine-shop or a booth where a thirsty man may get a\nmug of ale at a moderate reckoning?\"\n\nThat gilded youth staggered under my friendly blow as though the hammer\nof Thor himself had suddenly lit upon his shoulder, and ruefully\nrubbing his tender skin, he turned on me mild, handsome eyes, answering\nafter a moment, during which his native mildness struggled with the\npain I had unwittingly given him--\n\n\"If your thirst be as emphatic as your greeting, friend Heavy-fist, it\nwill certainly be a kindly deed to lead you to the drinking-place. My\nshoulder tingles with your good-fellowship,\" he added, keeping two\narms'-lengths clear of me.  \"Do you wish,\" he said, \"merely to cleanse\na dusty throat, or for blue or pink oblivion?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I answered laughingly, \"I have come a longish journey since\nyesterday night--a journey out of count of all reasonable mileage--and\nI might fairly plead a dusty throat as excuse for a beginning; but as\nto the other things mentioned, those tinted forgetfulnesses, I do not\neven know what you mean.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly you are a stranger,\" said the friendly youth, eyeing me\nfrom top to toe with renewed wonder, \"and by your unknown garb one from\nafar.\"\n\n\"From how far no man can say--not even I--but from very far, in truth.\nLet that stay your curiosity for the time.  And now to bench and\nale-mug, on good fellow!--the shortest way.  I was never so thirsty as\nthis since our water-butts went overboard when I sailed the southern\nseas as a tramp apprentice, and for three days we had to damp our black\ntongues with the puddles the night-dews left in the lift of our\nmainsail.\"\n\nWithout more words, being a little awed of me, I thought, the boy led\nme through the good-humoured crowd to where, facing the main road to\nthe town, but a little sheltered by a thicket of trees covered with\ngigantic pink blossoms, stood a drinking-place--a cluster of tables set\nround an open grass-plot.  Here he brought me a platter of some light\ninefficient cakes which merely served to make hunger more\nself-conscious, and some fine aromatic wine contained in a\ntriple-bodied flask, each division containing vintage of a separate\nhue.  We broke our biscuits, sipped that mysterious wine, and talked of\nmany things until at last something set us on the subject of astronomy,\na study I found my dapper gallant had some knowledge of--which was not\nto be wondered at seeing he dwelt under skies each night set thick\nabove his curly head with tawny planets, and glittering constellations\nsprinkled through space like flowers in May meadows.  He knew what\nworlds went round the sun, larger or lesser, and seeing this I began to\nquestion him, for I was uneasy in my innermost mind and, you will\nremember, so far had no certain knowledge of where I was, only a dim,\nrestless suspicion that I had come beyond the ken of all men's\nknowledge.\n\nTherefore, sweeping clear the board with my sleeve, and breaking the\nwafer cake I was eating, I set down one central piece for the sun, and,\n\"See here!\" I said, \"good fellow!  This morsel shall stand for that sun\nyou have just been welcoming back with quaint ritual.  Now stretch your\nstarry knowledge to the utmost, and put down that tankard for a moment.\nIf this be yonder sun and this lesser crumb be the outermost one of our\nrevolving system, and this the next within, and this the next, and so\non; now if this be so tell me which of these fragmentary orbs is\nours--which of all these crumbs from the hand of the primordial would\nbe that we stand upon?\"  And I waited with an anxiety a light manner\nthinly hid, to hear his answer.\n\nIt came at once.  Laughing as though the question were too trivial, and\nmore to humour my wayward fancy than aught else, that boy circled his\nrosy thumb about a minute and brought it down on the planet Mars!\n\nI started and stared at him; then all of a tremble cried, \"You trifle\nwith me!  Choose again--there, see, I will set the symbols and name\nthem to you anew.  There now, on your soul tell me truly which this\nplanet is, the one here at our feet?\"  And again the boy shook his\nhead, wondering at my eagerness, and pointed to Mars, saying gently as\nhe did so the fact was certain as the day above us, nothing was\nmarvellous but my questioning.\n\nMars! oh, dreadful, tremendous, unexpected!  With a cry of affright,\nand bringing my fist down on the table till all the cups upon it leapt,\nI told him he lied--lied like a simpleton whose astronomy was as rotten\nas his wit--smote the table and scowled at him for a spell, then turned\naway and let my chin fall upon my breast and my hands upon my lap.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, it might be so!  Everything about me was new and\nstrange, the crisp, thin air I breathed was new; the lukewarm sunshine\nnew; the sleek, long, ivory faces of the people new!  Yesterday--was it\nyesterday?--I was back there--away in a world that pines to know of\nother worlds, and one fantastic wish of mine, backed by a hideous,\ninfernal chance, had swung back the doors of space and shot me--if that\nboy spoke true--into the outer void where never living man had been\nbefore: all my wits about me, all the horrible bathos of my earthly\nclothing on me, all my terrestrial hungers in my veins!\n\nI sprang to my feet and swept my hands across my eyes.  Was that a\ndream, or this?  No, no, both were too real.  The hum of my faraway\ncity still rang in my ears: a swift vision of the girl I had loved; of\nthe men I had hated; of the things I had hoped for rose before me,\nstill dazing my inner eye.  And these about me were real people, too;\nit was real earth; real skies, trees, and rocks--had the infernal gods\nindeed heard, I asked myself, the foolish wish that started from my\nlips in a moment of fierce discontent, and swept me into another\nsphere, another existence? I looked at the boy as though he could\nanswer that question, but there was nothing in his face but vacuous\nwonder; I clapped my hands together and beat my breast; it was true; my\nsoul within me said it was true; the boy had not lied; the djins had\nheard; I was just in the flesh I had; my common human hungers still\nunsatisfied where never mortal man had hungered before; and scarcely\nknowing whether I feared or not, whether to laugh or cry, but with all\nthe wonder and terror of that great remove sweeping suddenly upon me I\nstaggered back to my seat, and dropping my arms upon the table, leant\nmy head heavily upon them and strove to choke back the passion which\nbeset me.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nIt was the light touch of the boy An upon my shoulder which roused me.\nHe was bending down, his pretty face full of concernful sympathy, and\nin a minute said--knowing nothing of my thoughts, of course.\n\n\"It is the wine, stranger, the pink oblivion, it sometimes makes one\nfeel like that until enough is taken; you stopped just short of what\nyou should have had, and the next cup would have been delight--I should\nhave told you.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" I answered, glad he should think so, \"it was the wine, no doubt;\nyour quaint drink, sir, tangled up my senses for the moment, but they\nare clearer now, and I am eager past expression to learn a little more\nof this strange country I have wandered into.\"\n\n\"I would rather,\" said the boy, relapsing again into his state of\nkindly lethargy, \"that you learnt things as you went, for talking is\nwork, and work we hate, but today we are all new and fresh, and if ever\nyou are to ask questions now is certainly the time.  Come with me to\nthe city yonder, and as we go I will answer the things you wish to\nknow;\" and I went with him, for I was humble and amazed, and, in truth,\nat that moment, had not a word to say for myself.\n\nAll the way from the plain where I had awoke to the walls of the city\nstood booths, drinking-places, and gardens divided by labyrinths of\ncanals, and embowered in shrubberies that seemed coming into leaf and\nflower as we looked, so swift was the process of their growth. These\nwaterways were covered with skiffs being pushed and rowed in every\ndirection; the cheerful rowers calling to each other through the leafy\nscreens separating one lane from another till the place was full of\ntheir happy chirruping.  Every booth and way-side halting-place was\nthronged with these delicate and sprightly people, so friendly, so\ngracious, and withal so purposeless.\n\nI began to think we should never reach the town itself, for first my\nguide would sit down on a green stream-bank, his feet a-dangle in the\nclear water, and bandy wit with a passing boat as though there were\nnothing else in the world to think of.  And when I dragged him out of\nthat, whispering in his ear, \"The town, my dear boy! the town!  I am\nall agape to see it,\" he would saunter reluctantly to a booth a hundred\nyards further on and fall to eating strange confections or sipping\ncoloured wines with chance acquaintances, till again I plucked him by\nthe sleeve and said: \"Seth, good comrade--was it not so you called your\ncity just now?--take me to the gates, and I will be grateful to you,\"\nthen on again down a flowery lane, aimless and happy, wasting my time\nand his, with placid civility I was led by that simple guide.\n\nWherever we went the people stared at me, as well they might, as I\nwalked through them overtopping the tallest by a head or more.  The\ndrinking-cups paused half-way to their mouths; the jests died away upon\ntheir lips; and the blinking eyes of the drinkers shone with a\nmomentary sparkle of wonder as their minds reeled down those\nmany-tinted floods to the realms of oblivion they loved.\n\nI heard men whisper one to another, \"Who is he?\"; \"Whence does he\ncome?\"; \"Is he a tribute-taker?\" as I strolled amongst them, my mind\nstill so thrilled with doubt and wonder that to me they seemed hardly\nmore than painted puppets, the vistas of their lovely glades and the\nivory town beyond only the fancy of a dream, and their talk as\nincontinent as the babble of a stream.\n\nThen happily, as I walked along with bent head brooding over the\nincredible thing that had happened, my companion's shapely legs gave\nout, and with a sigh of fatigue he suggested we should take a skiff\namongst the many lying about upon the margins and sail towards the\ntown, \"For,\" said he, \"the breeze blows thitherward, and 'tis a shame\nto use one's limbs when Nature will carry us for nothing!\"\n\n\"But have you a boat of your own hereabouts?\" I queried; \"for to tell\nthe truth I came from home myself somewhat poorly provided with means\nto buy or barter, and if your purse be not heavier than mine we must\nstill do as poor men do.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said An, \"there is no need to think of that, no one here to hire\nor hire of; we will just take the first skiff we see that suits us.\"\n\n\"And what if the owner should come along and find his boat gone?\"\n\n\"Why, what should he do but take the next along the bank, and the\nmaster of that the next again--how else could it be?\" said the Martian,\nand shrugging my shoulders, for I was in no great mood to argue, we\nwent down to the waterway, through a thicket of budding trees underlaid\nwith a carpet of small red flowers filling the air with a scent of\nhoney, and soon found a diminutive craft pulled up on the bank.  There\nwere some dainty cloaks and wraps in it which An took out and laid\nunder a tree. But first he felt in the pouch of one for a sweetmeat\nwhich his fine nostrils, acute as a squirrel's, told him was there, and\ntaking the lump out bit a piece from it, afterwards replacing it in the\nowner's pocket with the frankest simplicity.\n\nThen we pushed off, hoisted the slender mast, set the smallest lug-sail\nthat ever a sailor smiled at, and, myself at the helm, and that golden\nyouth amidships, away we drifted under thickets of drooping canes\ntasselled with yellow catkin-flowers, up the blue alley of the water\ninto the broader open river beyond with its rapid flow and crowding\nboats, the white city front now towering clear before us.\n\nThe air was full of sunshine and merry voices; birds were singing,\ntrees were budding; only my heart was heavy, my mind confused.  Yet why\nshould I be sad, I said to myself presently?  Life beat in my pulses;\nwhat had I to fear?  This world I had tumbled into was new and strange,\nno doubt, but tomorrow it would be old and familiar; it discredited my\nmanhood to sit brow-bent like that, so with an effort I roused myself.\n\n\"Old chap!\" I said to my companion, as he sat astride of a thwart\nslowly chewing something sticky and eyeing me out of the corner of his\neyes with vapid wonder, \"tell me something of this land of yours, or\nsomething about yourself--which reminds me I have a question to ask. It\nis a bit delicate, but you look a sensible sort of fellow, and will\ntake no offence.  The fact is, I have noticed as we came along half\nyour population dresses in all the colours of the rainbow--'fancy\nsuitings' our tailors could call it at home--and this half of the\ncensus are undoubtedly men and women.  The rub is that the other half,\nto which you belong, all dress alike in YELLOW, and I will be fired\nfrom the biggest gun on the Carolina's main deck if I can tell what sex\nyou belong to! I took you for a boy in the beginning, and the way you\nclosed with the idea of having a drink with me seemed to show I was\ndead on the right course.  Then a little later on I heard you and a\nfriend abusing our sex from an outside point of view in a way which was\nvery disconcerting. This, and some other things, have set me all abroad\nagain, and as fate seems determined to make us chums for this\nvoyage--why--well, frankly, I should be glad to know if you be boy or\ngirl?  If you are as I am, no more nor less then--for I like\nyou--there's my hand in comradeship. If you are otherwise, as those\nsleek outlines seem to promise--why, here's my hand again!  But man or\nwoman you must be--come, which is it?\"\n\nIf I had been perplexed before, to watch that boy now was more curious\nthan ever.  He drew back from me with a show of wounded dignity, then\nbit his lips, and sighed, and stared, and frowned.  \"Come,\" I said\nlaughingly, \"speak!  it engenders ambiguity to be so ambiguous of\ngender! 'Tis no great matter, yes or no, a plain answer will set us\nfairly in our friendship; if it is comrade, then comrade let it be; if\nmaid, why, I shall not quarrel with that, though it cost me a likely\nmessmate.\"\n\n\"You mock me.\"\n\n\"Not I, I never mocked any one.\"\n\n\"And does my robe tell you nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing so much; a yellow tunic and becoming enough, but nothing about\nit to hang a deduction on.  Come!  Are you a girl, after all?\"\n\n\"I do not count myself a girl.\"\n\n\"Why, then, you are the most blooming boy that ever eyes were set upon;\nand though 'tis with some tinge of regret, yet cheerfully I welcome you\ninto the ranks of manhood.\"\n\n\"I hate your manhood, send it after the maidhood; it fits me just as\nbadly.\"\n\n\"But An, be reasonable; man or maid you must be.\"\n\n\"Must be; why?\"\n\n\"Why?\"  Was ever such a question put to a sane mortal before?  I stared\nat that ambiguous thing before me, and then, a little wroth to be\nplayed with, growled out something about Martians being all drunk or\nmad.\n\n\"'Tis you yourself are one or other,\" said that individual, by this\ntime pink with anger, \"and if you think because I am what I am you can\nsafely taunt me, you are wrong.  See!  I have a sting,\" and like a\nthwarted child my companion half drew from the folds of the yellow\ntunic-dress the daintiest, most harmless-looking little dagger that was\never seen.\n\n\"Oh, if it comes to that,\" I answered, touching the Navy scabbard still\nat my hip, and regaining my temper at the sight of hers, \"why, I have a\nsting also--and twice as long as yours!  But in truth, An, let us not\ntalk of these things; if something in what I have said has offended\nnice Martian scruples I am sorry, and will question no more, leaving my\nwonder for time to settle.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the other, \"it was my fault to be hasty of offence; I am not\nso angered once a year.  But in truth your question moves us yellow\nrobes deeply.  Did you not really know that we who wear this saffron\ntunic are slaves,--a race apart, despised by all.\"\n\n\"'Slaves,' no; how should I know it?\"\n\n\"I thought you must understand a thing so fundamental, and it was that\nthought which made your questions seem unkind.  But if indeed you have\ncome so far as not to understand even this, then let me tell you once\nwe of this garb were women--priestesses of the immaculate conceptions\nof humanity; guardians of those great hopes and longings which die so\neasily. And because we forgot our high station and took to aping\nanother sex the gods deserted and men despised us, giving us, in the\nfierceness of their contempt, what we asked for.  We are the slave ants\nof the nest, the work-bees of the hive, come, in truth, of those here\nwho still be men and women of a sort, but toilers only; unknown in\nlove, unregretted in death--those who dangle all children but their\nown--slaves cursed with the accomplishment of their own ambition.\"\n\nThere was no doubt poor An believed what she said, for her attitude was\none of extreme dejection while she spoke, and to cheer her I laughed.\n\n\"Oh! come, it can't be as bad as that.  Surely sometimes some of you\nwin back to womanhood?  You yourself do not look so far gone but what\nsome deed of abnegation, some strong love if you could but conceive it\nwould set you right again.  Surely you of the primrose robes can\nsometimes love?\"\n\nWhereat unwittingly I troubled the waters in the placid soul of that\noutcast Martian!  I cannot exactly describe how it was, but she bent\nher head silently for a moment or two, and then, with a sigh, lifting\nher eyes suddenly to mine, said quietly, \"Yes, sometimes;\nsometimes--but very seldom,\" while for an instant across her face there\nflashed the summer lightning of a new hope, a single transient glance\nof wistful, timid entreaty; of wonder and delight that dared not even\nyet acknowledge itself.\n\nThen it was my turn to sit silent, and the pause was so awkward that in\na minute, to break it, I exclaimed--\n\n\"Let's drop personalities, old chap--I mean my dear Miss An.  Tell me\nsomething about your people, and let us begin properly at the top: have\nyou got a king, for instance?\"\n\nTo this the girl, pulling herself out of the pleasant slough of her\nlistlessness, and falling into my vein, answered--\n\n\"Both yes and no, sir traveller from afar--no chiefly, and yet perhaps\nyes.  If it were no then it were so, and if yes then Hath were our\nking.\"\n\n\"A mild king I should judge by your uncertainty.  In the place where I\ncame from kings press their individualities somewhat more clearly on\ntheir subjects' minds.  Is Hath here in the city?  Does he come to your\nfeasts today?\"\n\nAn nodded.  Hath was on the river, he had been to see the sunrise; even\nnow she thought the laughter and singing down behind the bend might be\nthe king's barge coming up citywards.  \"He will not be late,\" said my\ncompanion, \"because the marriage-feast is set for tomorrow in the\npalace.\"\n\nI became interested.  Kings, palaces, marriage-feasts--why, here was\nsomething substantial to go upon; after all these gauzy folk might turn\nout good fellows, jolly comrades to sojourn amongst--and\nmarriage-feasts reminded me again I was hungry.\n\n\"Who is it,\" I asked, with more interest in my tone, \"who gets\nmarried?--is it your ambiguous king himself?\"\n\nWhereat An's purple eyes broadened with wonder: then as though she\nwould not be uncivil she checked herself, and answered with smothered\npity for my ignorance, \"Not only Hath himself, but every one, stranger,\nthey are all married tomorrow; you would not have them married one at a\ntime, would you?\"--this with inexpressible derision.\n\nI said, with humility, something like that happened in the place I came\nfrom, asking her how it chanced the convenience of so many came to one\nclimax at the same moment.  \"Surely, An, this is a marvel of\narrangement. Where I dwelt wooings would sometimes be long or sometimes\nshort, and all maids were not complacent by such universal agreement.\"\n\nThe girl was clearly perplexed.  She stared at me a space, then said,\n\"What have wooings long or short to do with weddings?  You talk as if\nyou did your wooing first and then came to marriage--we get married\nfirst and woo afterwards!\"\n\n\"'Tis not a bad idea, and I can see it might lend an ease and certainty\nto the pastime which our method lacks.  But if the woman is got first\nand sued subsequently, who brings you together?  Who sees to the\nessential preliminaries of assortment?\"\n\nAn, looking at my shoes as though she speculated on the remoteness of\nthe journey I had come if it were measured by my ignorance, replied,\n\"The urn, stranger, the urn does that--what else?  How it may be in\nthat out-fashioned region you have come from I cannot tell, but\nhere--'tis so commonplace I should have thought you must have known\nit--we put each new year the names of all womenkind into an urn and the\nmen draw for them, each town, each village by itself, and those they\ndraw are theirs; is it conceivable your race has other methods?\"\n\nI told her it was so--we picked and chose for ourselves, beseeching the\ndamsels, fighting for them, and holding the sun of romance was at its\nsetting just where the Martians held it to rise.  Whereat An burst out\nlaughing--a clear, ringing laugh that set all the light-hearted folk in\nthe nearest boats laughing in sympathy.  But when the grotesqueness of\nthe idea had somewhat worn off, she turned grave and asked me if such a\nfancy did not lead to spite, envy, and bickerings.  \"Why, it seems to\nme,\" she said, shaking her curly head, \"such a plan might fire cities,\ndesolate plains, and empty palaces--\"\n\n\"Such things have been.\"\n\n\"Ah! our way is much the better.  See!\" quoth that gentle philosopher.\n\"'Here,' one of our women would say, 'am I to-day, unwed, as free of\nthought as yonder bird chasing the catkin down; tomorrow I shall be\nmarried, with a whole summer to make love in, relieved at one bound of\nall those uncertainties you acknowledge to, with nothing to do but lie\nabout on sunny banks with him whom chance sends me, come to the goal of\nlove without any travelling to get there.'  Why, you must acknowledge\nthis is the perfection of ease.\"\n\n\"But supposing,\" I said, \"chance dealt unkindly to you from your\nnuptial urn, supposing the man was not to your liking, or another\ncoveted him?\" To which An answered, with some shrewdness--\n\n\"In the first case we should do what we might, being no worse off than\nthose in your land who had played ill providence to themselves.  In the\nsecond, no maid would covet him whom fate had given to another, it were\ntoo fatiguing, or if such a thing DID happen, then one of them would\nwaive his claims, for no man or woman ever born was worth a wrangle,\nand it is allowed us to barter and change a little.\"\n\nAll this was strange enough.  I could not but laugh, while An laughed\nat the lightest invitation, and thus chatting and deriding each other's\nsocial arrangements we floated idly townwards and presently came out\ninto the main waterway perhaps a mile wide and flowing rapidly, as\nstreams will on the threshold of the spring, with brash or waste of\ndistant beaches riding down it, and every now and then a broken branch\nor tree-stem glancing through waves whose crests a fresh wind lifted\nand sowed in golden showers in the intervening furrows.  The Martians\nseemed expert upon the water, steering nimbly between these floating\ndangers when they met them, but for the most part hugging the shore\nwhere a more placid stream better suited their fancies, and for a time\nall went well.\n\nAn, as we went along, was telling me more of her strange country,\npointing out birds or flowers and naming them to me.  \"Now that,\" she\nsaid, pointing to a small grey owl who sat reflective on a floating log\nwe were approaching--\"that is a bird of omen; cover your face and look\naway, for it is not well to watch it.\"\n\nWhereat I laughed.  \"Oh!\" I answered, \"so those ancient follies have\ncome as far as this, have they?  But it is no bird grey or black or\nwhite that can frighten folk where I come from; see, I will ruffle his\nphilosophy for him,\" and suiting the action to the words I lifted a\npebble that happened to lie at the bottom of the boat and flung it at\nthat creature with the melancholy eyes.  Away went the owl, dipping his\nwings into the water at every stroke, and as he went wailing out a\nghostly cry, which even amongst sunshine and glitter made one's flesh\ncreep.\n\nAn shook her head.  \"You should not have done that,\" she said; \"our\ndead whom we send down over the falls come back in the body of yonder\nlittle bird.  But he has gone now,\" she added, with relief; \"see, he\nsettles far up stream upon the point of yonder rotten bough; I would\nnot disturb him again if I were you--\"\n\nWhatever more An would have said was lost, for amidst a sound of flutes\nand singing round the bend of the river below came a crowd of boats\ndecked with flowers and garlands, all clustering round a barge barely\nable to move, so thick those lesser skiffs pressed upon it.  So close\nthose wherries hung about that the garlanded rowers who sat at the oars\ncould scarcely pull, but, here as everywhere, it was the same good\ntemper, the same carelessness of order, as like a flowery island in the\ndancing blue water the motley fleet came up.\n\nI steered our skiff a space out from the bank to get a better view,\nwhile An clapped her hands together and laughed.  \"It is Hath--he\nhimself and those of the palace with him.  Steer a little nearer still,\nfriend--so! between yon floating rubbish flats, for those with Hath are\ngood to look at.\"\n\nNothing loth I made out into mid-stream to see that strange prince go\nby, little thinking in a few minutes I should be shaking hands with\nhim, a wet and dripping hero.  The crowd came up, and having the\nadvantage of the wind, it did not take me long to get a front place in\nthe ruck, whence I set to work, with republican interest in royalty, to\nstare at the man who An said was the head of Martian society.  He did\nnot make me desire to renounce my democratic principles.  The royal\nfellow was sitting in the centre of the barge under a canopy and on a\nthrone which was a mass of flowers, not bunched together as they would\nhave been with us, but so cunningly arranged that they rose from the\nfootstool to the pinnacle in a rhythm of colour, a poem in bud and\npetals the like of which for harmonious beauty I could not have\nimagined possible. And in this fairy den was a thin, gaunt young man,\ndressed in some sort of black stuff so nondescript that it amounted to\nlittle more than a shadow. I took it for granted that a substance of\nbone and muscle was covered by that gloomy suit, but it was the face\nabove that alone riveted my gaze and made me return the stare he gave\nme as we came up with redoubled interest.  It was not an unhandsome\nface, but ashy grey in colour and amongst the insipid countenances of\nthe Martians about him marvellously thoughtful.  I do not know whether\nthose who had killed themselves by learning ever leave ghosts behind,\nbut if so this was the very ideal for such a one.  At his feet I\nnoticed, when I unhooked my eyes from his at last, sat a girl in a\nloose coral pink gown who was his very antipode. Princess Heru, for so\nshe was called, was resting one arm upon his knee at our approach and\npulling a blue convolvulus bud to pieces--a charming picture of dainty\nidleness.  Anything so soft, so silken as that little lady was never\nseen before.  Who am I, a poor quarter-deck loafer, that I should\nattempt to describe what poet and painter alike would have failed to\nrealise?  I know, of course, your stock descriptives: the melting eye,\nthe coral lip, the peachy cheek, the raven tress; but these were coined\nfor mortal woman--and this was not one of them. I will not attempt to\ndescribe the glorious tenderness of those eyes she turned upon me\npresently; the glowing radiance of her skin; the infinite grace of\nevery action; the incredible soul-searching harmony of her voice, when\nlater on I heard it--you must gather something of these things as I\ngo--suffice it to say that when I saw her there for the first time in\nthe plenitude of her beauty I fell desperately, wildly in love with her.\n\nMeanwhile, even the most infatuated of mortals cannot stare for ever\nwithout saying something.  The grating of our prow against the\ngarlanded side of the royal barge roused me from my reverie, and\nnodding to An, to imply I would be back presently, I lightly jumped on\nto Hath's vessel, and, with the assurance of a free and independent\nAmerican voter, approached that individual, holding out my palm, and\nsaying as I did so,\n\n\"Shake hands, Mr. President!\"\n\nThe prince came forward at my bidding and extending his hand for mine.\nHe bowed slow and sedately, in that peculiar way the Martians have, a\nripple of gratified civility passing up his flesh; lower and lower he\nbowed, until his face was over our clasped hands, and then, with simple\ncourtesy, he kissed my finger-tips!  This was somewhat embarrassing. It\nwas not like the procedure followed in Courts nearer to Washington than\nthis one, as far as my reading went, and, withdrawing my fingers\nhastily, I turned to the princess, who had risen, and was eyeing her\nsomewhat awkwardly, the while wondering what kind of salutation would\nbe suitable in her case when a startling incident happened.  The river,\nas said, was full of floating rubbish brought down from some far-away\nuplands by a spring freshet while the royal convoy was making slow\nprogress upstream and thus met it all bow on.  Some of this stuff was\nheavy timber, and when a sudden warning cry went up from the leading\nboats it did not take my sailor instinct long to guess what was amiss.\nThose in front shot side to side, those behind tried to drop back as,\nbearing straight down on the royal barge, there came a log of black\nwood twenty feet long and as thick as the mainmast of an old\nthree-decker.\n\nHath's boat could no more escape than if it had been planted on a rocky\npedestal, garlands and curtains trailing in the water hung so heavy on\nit.  The gilded paddles of the slender rowers were so feeble--they had\nbut made a half-turn from that great javelin's road when down it came\nupon them, knocking the first few pretty oarsmen head over heels and\ncrackling through their oars like a bull through dry maize stalks. I\nsprang forward, and snatching a pole from a half-hearted slave, jammed\nthe end into the head of the log and bore with all my weight upon it,\ndiverting it a little, and thereby perhaps saving the ship herself, but\nnot enough.  As it flashed by a branch caught upon the trailing\ntapestry, hurling me to the deck, and tearing away with it all that\nfinery. Then the great spar, tossing half its dripping length into the\nair, went plunging downstream with shreds of silk and flowers trailing\nfrom it, and white water bubbling in its rear.\n\nWhen I scrambled to my feet all was ludicrous confusion on board. Hath\nstill stood by his throne--an island in a sea of disorder--staring at\nme; all else was chaos.  The rowers and courtiers were kicking and\nwallowing in the \"waist\" of the ship like fish newly shot out of a\ntrawl net, but the princess was gone.  Where was she?  I brushed the\nspray from my eyes, and stared overboard.  She was not in the bubbling\nblue water alongside.  Then I glanced aft to where the log, now fifteen\nyards away, was splashing through the sunshine, and, as I looked, a\nfair arm came up from underneath and white fingers clutched\nconvulsively at the sky. What man could need more?  Down the barge I\nrushed, and dropping only my swordbelt, leapt in to her rescue.  The\ngentle Martians were too numb to raise a hand in help; but it was not\nnecessary.  I had the tide with me, and gained at every stroke.\nMeanwhile that accursed tree, with poor Heru's skirts caught on a\nbranch, was drowning her at its leisure; lifting her up as it rose upon\nthe crests, a fair, helpless bundle, and then sousing her in its fall\ninto the nether water, where I could see her gleam now and again like\npink coral.\n\nI redoubled my efforts and got alongside, clutching the rind of that\nold stump, and swimming and scrambling, at last was within reach of the\nprincess.  Thereon the log lifted her playfully to my arms, and when I\nhad laid hold came down, a crushing weight, and forced us far into the\nclammy bosom of Martian sea.  Again we came up, coughing and choking--I\ntugging furiously at that tangled raiment, and the lady, a mere lump of\nsweetness in my other arm--then down again with that log upon me and\nall the noises of Eblis in my ears.  Up and down we went, over and\nover, till strength was spent and my ribs seemed breaking; then, with a\nlast desperate effort, I got a knee against the stem, and by sheer\nstrength freed my princess--the spiteful timber made a last ugly thrust\nat us as it rolled away--and we were free!\n\nI turned upon my back, and, sure of rescue now, took the lady's head\nupon my chest, holding her sweet, white fists in mine the while, and,\nfloating, waited for help.\n\nIt came only too quickly.  The gallant Martians, when they saw the\nprincess saved, came swiftly down upon us.  Over the lapping of the\nwater in my ears I heard their sigh--like cries of admiration and\nsurprise, the rattle of spray on the canoe sides mingled with the\nsplash of oars, the flitting shadows of their prows were all about us,\nand in less time than it takes to write we were hauled aboard, revived,\nand taken to Hath's barge.  Again the prince's lips were on my\nfingertips; again the flutes and music struck up; and as I squeezed the\nwater out of my hair, and tried to keep my eyes off the outline of\nHeru, whose loveliness shone through her damp, clinging, pink robe, as\nif that robe were but a gauzy fancy, I vaguely heard Hath saying\nwondrous things of my gallantry, and, what was more to the purpose,\nasking me to come with him and stay that night at the palace.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThey lodged me like a prince in a tributary country that first night. I\nwas tired.  'Twas a stiff stage I had come the day before, and they\ngave me a couch whose ethereal softness seemed to close like the wings\nof a bird as I plunged at its touch into fathomless slumbers.  But the\nnext day had hardly broken when I was awake, and, stretching my limbs\nupon the piled silk of a legless bed upon the floor, found myself in a\ngreat chamber with a purple tapestry across the entrance, and a square\narch leading to a flat terrace outside.\n\nIt was a glorious daybreak, making my heart light within me, the air\nlike new milk, and the colours of the sunrise lay purple and yellow in\nbars across my room.  I yawned and stretched, then rising, wrapped a\nsilken quilt about me and went out into the flat terrace top, wherefrom\nall the city could be seen stretched in an ivory and emerald patchwork,\nwith open, blue water on one side, and the Martian plain trending away\nin illimitable distance upon the other.\n\nDirectly underneath in the great square at the bottom of Hath's palace\nsteps were gathered a concourse of people, brilliant in many-coloured\ndresses.  They were sitting or lying about just as they might for all I\nknew have done through the warm night, without much order, save that\nwhere the black streaks of inlaid stone marked a carriageway across the\nsquare none were stationed.  While I wondered what would bring so many\ntogether thus early, there came a sound of flutes--for these people can\ndo nothing without piping like finches in a thicket in May--and from\nthe storehouses half-way over to the harbour there streamed a line of\ncarts piled high with provender.  Down came the teams attended by their\nslaves, circling and wheeling into the open place, and as they passed\neach group those lazy, lolling beggars crowded round and took the dole\nthey were too thriftless to earn themselves.  It was strange to see how\nlistless they were about the meal, even though Providence itself put it\ninto their hands; to note how the yellow-girted slaves scudded amongst\nthem, serving out the loaves, themselves had grown, harvested, and\nbaked; slipping from group to group, rousing, exhorting, administering\nto a helpless throng that took their efforts without thought or thanks.\n\nI stood there a long time, one foot upon the coping and my chin upon my\nhand, noting the beauty of the ruined town and wondering how such a\nfeeble race as that which lay about, breakfasting in the limpid\nsunshine, could have come by a city like this, or kept even the ruins\nof its walls and buildings from the covetousness of others, until\npresently there was a rustle of primrose garments and my friend of the\nday before stood by me.\n\n\"Are you rested, traveller?\" she questioned in that pretty voice of\nhers.\n\n\"Rested ambrosially, An.\"\n\n\"It is well; I will tell the Government and it will come up to wash and\ndress you, afterwards giving you breakfast.\"\n\n\"For the breakfast, damsel, I shall be grateful, but as for the washing\nand dressing I will defend myself to the last gasp sooner than submit\nto such administration.\"\n\n\"How strange!  Do you never wash in your country?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it is a matter left largely to our own discretion; so, my\ndear girl, if you will leave me for a minute or two in quest of that\nmeal you have mentioned, I will guarantee to be ready when it comes.\"\n\nAway she slipped, with a shrug of her rosy shoulders, to return\npresently, carrying a tray covered with a white cloth, whereon were\nhalf a dozen glittering covers whence came most fragrant odours of\ncooked things.\n\n\"Why, comrade,\" I said, sitting down and lifting lid by lid, for the\ncold, sweet air outside had made me hungry, \"this is better than was\nhoped for; I thought from what I saw down yonder I should have to trot\nbehind a tumbril for my breakfast, and eat it on my heels amongst your\nsleepy friends below.\"\n\nAn replied, \"The stranger is a prince, we take it, in his own country,\nand princes fare not quite like common people, even here.\"\n\n\"So,\" I said, my mouth full of a strange, unknown fish, and a cake soft\nas milk and white as cotton in the pod.  \"Now that makes me feel at\nhome!\"\n\n\"Would you have had it otherwise with us?\"\n\n\"No! now I come to think of it, it is most natural things should be\nmuch alike in all the corners of the universe; the splendid simplicity\nthat rules the spheres, works much the same, no doubt, upon one side of\nthe sun as upon the other.  Yet, somehow--you can hardly wonder at\nit--yesterday I looked to find your world, when I realised where I had\ntumbled to, a world of djin and giants; of mad possibilities over\nrealised, and here I see you dwellers by the utterly remote little more\nmarvellous than if I had come amongst you on the introduction of a\ncheap tourist ticket, and round some neglected corner of my own distant\nworld!\"\n\n\"I hardly follow your meaning, sir.\"\n\n\"No, no, of course you cannot.  I was forgetting you did not know!\nThere, pass me the stuff on yonder platter that looks like caked mud\nfrom an anchor fluke, and swells like breath of paradise, and let me\nquestion you;\" and while I sat and drank with that yellow servitor\nsitting in front of me, I plied her with questions, just as a baby\nmight who had come into the world with a full-blown gift of speech.\nBut though she was ready and willing enough to answer, and laughed\ngaily at my quaint ignorance of simple things, yet there was little\nwater in the well.\n\n\"Had they any kind of crafts or science; any cult of stars or figures?\"\nBut again she shook her head, and said, \"Hath might know, Hath\nunderstood most things, but herself knew little of either.\"  \"Armies or\nnavies?\" and again the Martian shrugged her shoulders, questioning in\nturn--\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"What for!\" I cried, a little angry with her engaging dulness, \"Why, to\nkeep that which the strong hand got, and to get more for those who come\nnext; navies to sweep yonder blue seas, and armies to ward what they\nshould bring home, or guard the city walls against all enemies,--for I\nsuppose, An,\" I said, putting down my knife as the cheering thought\ncame on me,--\"I suppose, An, you have some enemies?  It is not like\nProvidence to give such riches as you possess, such lands, such cities,\nand not to supply the antidote in some one poor enough to covet them.\"\n\nAt once the girl's face clouded over, and it was obvious a tender\nsubject had been chanced upon.  She waved her hand impatiently as\nthough to change the subject, but I would not be put off.\n\n\"Come,\" I said, \"this is better than breakfast.  It was the one\nthing--this unknown enemy of yours--wanting to lever the dull mass of\nyour too peacefulness.  What is he like?  How strong?  How stands the\nquarrel between you?  I was a soldier myself before the sea allured me,\nand love horse and sword best of all things.\"\n\n\"You would not jest if you knew our enemy!\"\n\n\"That is as it may be.  I have laughed in the face of many a stronger\nfoe than yours is like to prove; but anyhow, give me a chance to judge.\nCome, who is it that frightens all the blood out of your cheeks by a\nbare mention and may not be laughed at even behind these substantial\nwalls?\"\n\n\"First, then, you know, of course, that long ago this land of ours was\nharried from the West.\"\n\n\"Not I.\"\n\n\"No!\" said An, with a little warmth.  \"If it comes to that, you know\nnothing.\"\n\nWhereat I laughed, and, saying the reply was just, vowed I would not\ninterrupt again; so she wont on saying how Hath--that interminable\nHath!--would know it all better than she did, but long ago the land was\noverrun by a people from beyond the broad, blue waters outside; a\npeople huge of person, hairy and savage, uncouth, unlettered, and poor\nAn's voice trembled even to describe them; a people without mercy or\ncompunction, dwellers in woods, eaters of flesh, who burnt, plundered,\nand destroyed all before them, and had toppled over this city along\nwith many others in an ancient foray, the horrors of which, still burnt\nlurid in her people's minds.\n\n\"Ever since then,\" went on the girl, \"these odious terrors of the outer\nland have been a nightmare to us, making hectic our pleasures, and\nfilling our peace with horrid thoughts of what might be, should they\nchance to come again.\"\n\n\"'Tis unfortunate, no doubt, lady,\" I answered.  \"Yet it was long ago,\nand the plunderers are far away.  Why not rise and raid them in turn?\nTo live under such a nightmare is miserable, and a poet on my side of\nthe ether has said--\n\n  \"'He either fears his fate too much,\n    Or his deserts are small,\n  Who will not put it to the touch,\n    To win or lose it all.'\n\nIt seems to me you must either bustle and fight again, or sit tamely\ndown, and by paying the coward's fee for peace, buy at heavy price,\nindulgence from the victor.\"\n\n\"We,\" said An simply, and with no show of shame, \"would rather die than\nfight, and so we take the easier way, though a heavy one it is. Look!\"\nshe said, drawing me to the broad window whence we could get a glimpse\nof the westward town and the harbour out beyond the walls. \"Look! see\nyonder long row of boats with brown sails hanging loose reefed from\nevery yard ranged all along the quay.  Even from here you can make out\nthe thin stream of porter slaves passing to and fro between them and\nthe granaries like ants on a sunny path.  Those are our tax-men's\nships, they came yesterday from far out across the sea, as punctual as\nfate with the first day of spring, and two or three nights hence we\ntrust will go again: and glad shall we be to see them start, although\nthey leave scupper deep with our cloth, our corn, and gold.\"\n\n\"Is that what they take for tribute?\"\n\n\"That and one girl--the fairest they can find.\"\n\n\"One--only one!  'Tis very moderate, all things considered.\"\n\n\"She is for the thither king, Ar-hap, and though only one as you say,\nstranger, yet he who loses her is apt sometimes to think her one too\nmany lost.\"\n\n\"By Jupiter himself it is well said!  If I were that man I would stir\nup heaven and hell until I got her back; neither man, nor beast, nor\ndevil should stay me in my quest!\"  As I spoke I thought for a minute\nAn's fingers trembled a little as she fixed a flower upon my coat,\nwhile there was something like a sigh in her voice as she said--\n\n\"The maids of this country are not accustomed, sir, to be so strongly\nloved.\"\n\nBy this time, breakfasted and rehabilitated, I was ready to go forth.\nThe girl swung back the heavy curtain that served in place of door\nacross the entrance of my chamber, and leading the way by a corridor\nand marble steps while I followed, and whether it was the Martian air\nor the meal I know not, but thinking mighty well of myself until we\ncame presently onto the main palace stairs, which led by stately\nflights from the upper galleries to the wide square below.\n\nAs we passed into the full sunshine--and no sunshine is so crisply\ngolden as the Martian--amongst twined flowers and shrubs and gay,\nquaint birds building in the cornices, a sleek youth rose slowly from\nwhere he had spread his cloak as couch upon a step and approaching\nasked--\n\n\"You are the stranger of yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\n\"Then I bring a message from Prince Hath, saying it would pleasure him\ngreatly if you would eat the morning meal with him.\"\n\n\"Why,\" I answered, \"it is very civil indeed, but I have breakfasted\nalready.\"\n\n\"And so has Hath,\" said the boy, gently yawning.  \"You see I came here\nearly this morning, but knowing you would pass sooner or later I\nthought it would save me the trouble if I lay down till you came--those\nquaint people who built these places were so prodigal of steps,\" and\nsmiling apologetically he sank back on his couch and began toying with\na leaf.\n\n\"Sweet fellow,\" I said, and you will note how I was getting into their\nstyle of conversation, \"get back to Hath when you have rested, give him\nmy most gracious thanks for the intended courtesy, but tell him the\ninvitation should have started a week earlier; tell him from me, you\nnimble-footed messenger, that I will post-date his kindness and come\ntomorrow; say that meanwhile I pray him to send any ill news he has for\nme by you.  Is the message too bulky for your slender shoulders?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the boy, rousing himself slowly, \"I will take it,\" and then\nhe prepared to go.  He turned again and said, without a trace of\nincivility, \"But indeed, stranger, I wish you would take the message\nyourself. This is the third flight of stairs I have been up today.\"\n\nEverywhere it was the same friendly indolence.  Half the breakfasters\nwere lying on coloured shawls in groups about the square; the other\nhalf were strolling off--all in one direction, I noticed--as slowly as\ncould be towards the open fields beyond; no one was active or had\nanything to do save the yellow folk who flitted to and fro fostering\nthe others, and doing the city work as though it were their only\nthought in life. There were no shops in that strange city, for there\nwere no needs; some booths I saw indeed, and temple-like places, but\nhollow, and used for birds and beasts--things these lazy Martians love.\nThere was no tramp of busy feet, for no one was busy; no clank of\nswords or armour in those peaceful streets, for no one was warlike; no\nhustle, for no one hurried; no wide-packed asses nodding down the\nlanes, for there was nothing to fill their packs with, and though a\ncart sometimes came by with a load of lolling men and maids, or a small\nhorse, for horses they had, paced along, itself nearly as lazy as the\nmaster he bore, with trappings sewed over bits of coloured shell and\ncoral, yet somehow it was all extraordinarily unreal.  It was a city\nfull of the ghosts of the life which once pulsed through its ways.  The\nstreets were peopled, the chatter of voices everywhere, the singing\nboys and laughing girls wandering, arms linked together, down the ways\nfilled every echo with their merriment, yet somehow it was all so\nshallow that again and again I rubbed my eyes, wondering if I were\nindeed awake, or whether it were not a prolonged sleep of which the\ntomorrow were still to come.\n\n\"What strikes me as strangest of all, good comrade,\" I observed\npleasantly to the tripping presence at my elbow, \"is that these\ncountrymen of yours who shirk to climb a flight of steps, and have\npalms as soft as rose petals, these wide ways paved with stones as hard\nas a usurer's heart.\"\n\nAn laughed.  \"The stones were still in their native quarries had it\nbeen left to us to seek them; we are like the conies in the ruins, sir,\nthe inheritors of what other hands have done.\"\n\n\"Ay, and undone, I think, as well, for coming along I have noted axe\nchippings upon the walls, smudges of ancient fire and smoke upon the\ncornices.\"\n\nAn winced a little and stared uneasily at the walls, muttering below\nher breath something about trying to hide with flower garlands the\nmarks they could not banish, but it was plain the conversation was not\npleasing to her.  So unpleasant was talk or sight of woodmen\n(Thither-folk, as she called them, in contradiction to the Hither\npeople about us here), that the girl was clearly relieved when we were\nfree of the town and out into the open playground of the people.  The\nwhole place down there was a gay, shifting crowd.  The booths of\nyesterday, the arcades, the archways, were still standing, and during\nthe night unknown hands had redecked them with flowers, while another\nday's sunshine had opened the coppice buds so that the whole place was\nbrilliant past expression.  And here the Hither folk were varying their\nidleness by a general holiday.  They were standing about in groups, or\nlying ranked like new-plucked flowers on the banks, piping to each\nother through reeds as soft and melodious as running water.  They were\nplaying inconsequent games and breaking off in the middle of them like\nchildren looking for new pleasures.  They were idling about the\ndrinking booths, delicately stupid with quaint, thin wines, dealt out\nto all who asked; the maids were ready to chevy or be chevied through\nthe blossoming thickets by anyone who chanced upon them, the men\nslipped their arms round slender waists and wandered down the paths,\nscarce seeming to care even whose waist it was they circled or into\nwhose ear they whispered the remainder of the love-tale they had begun\nto some one else.  And everywhere it was \"Hi,\" and \"Ha,\" and \"So,\" and\n\"See,\" as these quaint people called to one another, knowing each other\nas familiarly as ants of a nest, and by the same magic it seemed to me.\n\n\"An,\" I said presently, when we had wandered an hour or so through the\ndrifting throng, \"have these good countrymen of yours no other names\nbut monosyllabic, nothing to designate them but these chirruping\nsyllables?\"\n\n\"Is it not enough?\" answered my companion.  \"Once indeed I think we had\nlonger names, but,\" she added, smiling, \"how much trouble it saves to\nlimit each one to a single sound.  It is uncivil to one's neighbours to\nburden their tongues with double duty when half would do.\"\n\n\"But have you no patronymics--nothing to show the child comes of the\nsame source as his father came?\"\n\n\"We have no fathers.\"\n\n\"What! no fathers?\" I said, starting and staring at her.\n\n\"No, nor mothers either, or at least none that we remember, for again,\nwhy should we?  Mayhap in that strange district you come from you keep\ncount of these things, but what have we to do with either when their\ninitial duty is done.  Look at that painted butterfly swinging on the\nhoney-laden catkin there.  What knows she of the mother who shed her\nlife into a flowercup and forgot which flower it was the minute\nafterwards. We, too, are insects, stranger.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to say of this great concourse here, that every atom\nis solitary, individual, and can claim no kindred with another save the\nloose bonds of a general fraternity--a specious idea, horrible,\nimpracticable!\"\n\nWhereat An laughed.  \"Ask the grasshoppers if it is impracticable; ask\nthe little buzzing things of grass and leaves who drift hither and\nthither upon each breath of wind, finding kinsmen never but comrades\neverywhere--ask them if it is horrible.\"\n\nThis made me melancholy, and somehow set me thinking of the friends\nimmeasurably distant I had left but yesterday.\n\nWhat were they doing?  Did they miss me?  I was to have called for my\npay this afternoon, and tomorrow was to have run down South to see that\nfreckled lady of mine.  What would she think of my absence?  What would\nshe think if she knew where I was?  Gods, it was too mad, too absurd! I\nthrust my hands into my pockets in fierce desperation, and there they\nclutched an old dance programme and an out-of-date check for a New York\nferry-boat.  I scowled about on that sunny, helpless people, and laying\nmy hand bitterly upon my heart felt in the breast-pocket beneath a\npacket of unpaid Boston tailors' bills and a note from my landlady\nasking if I would let her aunt do my washing while I was on shore. Oh!\nwhat would they all think of me?  Would they brand me as a deserter, a\npoltroon, and a thief, letting my name presently sink down in shame and\nmystery in the shadowy realm of the forgotten?  Dreadful thoughts! I\nwould think no more.\n\nMaybe An had marked my melancholy, for presently she led me to a stall\nwhere in fantastic vases wines of sorts I have described before were\nput out for all who came to try them.  There was medicine here for\nevery kind of dulness--not the gross cure which earthly wine effects,\nbut so nicely proportioned to each specific need that one could\nregulate one's debauch to a hairbreadth, rising through all the gamut\nof satisfaction, from the staid contentment coming of that flask there\nto the wild extravagances of the furthermost vase.  So my stripling\ntold me, running her finger down the line of beakers carved with\nstrange figures and cased in silver, each in its cluster of little\nattendant drinking-cups, like-coloured, and waiting round on the white\nnapkins as the shore boats wait to unload a cargo round the sides of a\nmerchant vessel.\n\n\"And what,\" I said, after curiously examining each liquor in turn,\n\"what is that which stands alone there in the humble earthen jar, as\nthough unworthy of the company of the others.\"\n\n\"Oh, that,\" said my friend, \"is the most essential of them all--that is\nthe wine of recovery, without which all the others were deadly poisons.\"\n\n\"The which, lady, looks as if it had a moral attaching to it.\"\n\n\"It may have; indeed I think it has, but I have forgotten.  Prince Hath\nwould know!  Meanwhile let me give you to drink, great stranger, let me\nget you something.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" I laughed, \"reach me down an antidote to fate, a specific\nfor an absent mistress, and forgetful friends.\"\n\n\"What was she like?\" said An, hesitating a little and frowning.\n\n\"Nay, good friend,\" was my answer, \"what can that matter to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing, of course,\" answered that Martian, and while she took\nfrom the table a cup and filled it with fluid I felt in the pouch of my\nsword-belt to see if by chance a bit of money was lying there, but\nthere was none, only the pips of an orange poor Polly had sucked and\nlaughingly thrown at me.\n\nHowever, it did not matter.  The girl handed me the cup, and I put my\nlips to it.  The first taste was bitter and acrid, like the liquor of\nlong-steeped wood.  At the second taste a shiver of pleasure ran\nthrough me, and I opened my eyes and stared hard.  The third taste\ngrossness and heaviness and chagrin dropped from my heart; all the\ncomplexion of Providence altered in a flash, and a stupid irresistible\njoy, unreasoning, uncontrollable took possession of my fibre.  I sank\nupon a mossy bank and, lolling my head, beamed idiotically on the\nlolling Martians all about me.  How long I was like that I cannot say.\nThe heavy minutes of sodden contentment slipped by unnoticed,\nunnumbered, till presently I felt the touch of a wine-cup at my lips\nagain, and drinking of another liquor dulness vanished from my mind, my\neyes cleared, my heart throbbed; a fantastic gaiety seized upon my\nlimbs; I bounded to my feet, and seizing An's two hands in mine, swung\nthat damsel round in a giddy dance, capering as never dancer danced\nbefore, till spent and weary I sank down again from sheer lack of\nbreath, and only knew thereafter that An was sitting by me saying,\n\"Drink! drink stranger, drink and forget!\" and as a third time a cup\nwas pressed to my lips, aches and pleasures, stupidness and joy, life\nitself, seemed slipping away into a splendid golden vacuity, a hazy\nepisode of unconscious Elysium, indefinite, and unfathomable.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWhen I woke, feeling as refreshed as though I had been dreaming through\na long night, An, seeing me open-eyed, helped me to my feet, and when I\nhad recovered my senses a little, asked if we should go on.  I was\nmyself again by this time, so willingly took her hand, and soon came\nout of the tangle into the open spaces.  I must have been under the\nspell of the Martian wines longer than it seemed, for already it was\nlate in the afternoon, the shadows of trees were lying deep and\nfar-reaching over the motley crowds of people.  Out here as the day\nwaned they had developed some sort of method in their sports.  In front\nof us was a broad, grassy course marked off with garlanded\nfinger-posts, and in this space rallies of workfolk were taking part in\nall manner of games under the eyes of a great concourse of spectators,\ndoing the Martians' pleasures for them as they did their labours.  An\nled me gently on, leaning on my arm heavier, I thought, than she had\ndone in the morning, and ever and anon turning her gazelle-like eyes\nupon me with a look I could not understand.  As we sauntered forward I\nnoticed all about lesser circles where the yellow-girted ones were\ndrawing delighted laughter from good-tempered crowds by tricks of\nsleight-of-hand, and posturing, or tossing gilded cups and balls as\nthough they were catering, as indeed they were, for outgrown children.\nOthers fluted or sang songs in chorus to the slow clapping of hands,\nwhile others were doing I knew not what, sitting silent amongst silent\nspectators who every now and then burst out laughing for no cause that\nI could see.  But An would not let me stop, and so we pushed on through\nthe crowd till we came to the main enclosures where a dozen slaves had\nrun a race for the amusement of those too lazy to race themselves, and\nwere sitting panting on the grass.\n\nTo give them time to get their breath, perhaps, a man stepped out of\nthe crowd dressed in a dark blue tunic, a strange vacuous-looking\nfellow, and throwing down a sheaf of javelins marched off a dozen\npaces, then, facing round, called out loudly he would give sixteen\nsuits of \"summer cloth\" to any one who could prick him with a javelin\nfrom the heap.\n\n\"Why,\" I said in amazement, \"this is the best of fools--no one could\nmiss from such a distance.\"\n\n\"Ay but,\" replied my guide, \"he is a gifted one, versed in mystics.\"\n\nI was just going to say a good javelin, shod with iron, was a stronger\nargument than any mystic I had ever heard of could stand, when out of\nthe crowd stepped a youth, and amid the derisive cheers of his friends\nchose a reed from the bundle.  He poised it in his hand a minute to get\nthe middle, then turned on the living target.  Whatever else they might\nbe, these Martians were certainly beautiful as the daytime.  Never had\nI seen such a perfect embodiment of grace and elegance as that boy as\nhe stood there for a moment poised to the throw; the afternoon sunshine\nwarm and strong on his bunched brown hair, a girlish flush of shyness\non his handsome face, and the sleek perfection of his limbs, clear cut\nagainst the dusky background beyond.  And now the javelin was going.\nSurely the mystic would think better of it at the last moment!  No! the\ninitiate held his ground with tight-shut lips and retrospective eyes,\nand even as I looked the weapon flew upon its errand.\n\n\"There goes the soul of a fool!\" I exclaimed, and as the words were\nuttered the spear struck, or seemed to, between the neck and shoulder,\nbut instead of piercing rose high into the air, quivering and flashing,\nand presently turning over, fell back, and plunged deep into the turf,\nwhile a low murmur of indifferent pleasure went round amongst the\nonlookers.\n\nThereat An, yawning gently, looked to me and said, \"A strong-willed\nfellow, isn't he, friend?\"\n\nI hesitated a minute and then asked, \"Was it WILL which turned that\nshaft?\"\n\nShe answered with simplicity, \"Why, of course--what else?\"\n\nBy this time another boy had stepped out, and having chosen a javelin,\ntested it with hand and foot, then retiring a pace or two rushed up to\nthe throwing mark and flung it straight and true into the bared bosom\nof the man.  And as though it had struck a wall of brass, the shaft\nleapt back falling quivering at the thrower's feet.  Another and\nanother tried unsuccessfully, until at last, vexed at their futility, I\nsaid, \"I have a somewhat scanty wardrobe that would be all the better\nfor that fellow's summer suiting, by your leave I will venture a throw\nagainst him.\"\n\n\"It is useless,\" answered An; \"none but one who knows more magic than\nhe, or is especially befriended by the Fates can touch him through the\nenvelope he has put on.\"\n\n\"Still, I think I will try.\"\n\n\"It is hopeless, I would not willingly see you fail,\" whispered the\ngirl, with a sudden show of friendship.\n\n\"And what,\" I said, bending down, \"would you give me if I succeeded?\"\nWhereat An laughed a little uneasily, and, withdrawing her hand from\nmine, half turned away.  So I pushed through the spectators and stepped\ninto the ring.  I went straight up to the pile of weapons, and having\nchosen one went over to the mystic.  \"Good fellow,\" I cried out\nostentatiously, trying the sharpness of the javelin-point with my\nfinger, \"where are all of those sixteen summer suits of yours lying\nhid?\"\n\n\"It matters nothing,\" said the man, as if he were asleep.\n\n\"Ay, but by the stars it does, for it will vex the quiet repose of your\nsoul tomorrow if your heirs should swear they could not find them.\"\n\n\"It matters nothing,\" muttered the will-wrapped visionary.\n\n\"It will matter something if I take you at your word.  Come, friend\nPurple-jerkin, will you take the council with your legs and run while\nthere is yet time, or stand up to be thrown at?\"\n\n\"I stand here immoveable in the confidence of my initiation.\"\n\n\"Then, by thunder, I will initiate you into the mysteries of a\njavelin-end, and your blood be on your head.\"\n\nThe Martians were all craning their necks in hushed eagerness as I\nturned to the casting-place, and, poising the javelin, faced the\nmagician. Would he run at the last moment?  I half hoped so; for a\nminute I gave him the chance, then, as he showed no sign of wavering, I\ndrew my hand back, shook the javelin back till it bent like a reed, and\nhurled it at him.\n\nThe Martians' heads turned as though all on one pivot as the spear sped\nthrough the air, expecting no doubt to see it recoil as others had\ndone. But it took him full in the centre of his chest, and with a wild\nwave of arms and a flutter of purple raiment sent him backwards, and\ndown, and over and over in a shapeless heap of limbs and flying\nraiment, while a low murmur of awed surprise rose from the spectators.\nThey crowded round him in a dense ring, as An came flitting to me with\na startled face.\n\n\"Oh, stranger,\" she burst out, \"you have surely killed him!\" but more\nastounded I had broken down his guard than grieved at his injury.\n\n\"No,\" I answered smilingly; \"a sore chest he may have tomorrow, but\ndead he is not, for I turned the lance-point back as I spun it, and it\nwas the butt-end I threw at him!\"\n\n\"It was none the less wonderful; I thought you were a common man, a\nprince mayhap, come but from over the hills, but now something tells me\nyou are more than that,\" and she lapsed into thoughtful silence for a\ntime.\n\nNeither of us were wishful to go back amongst those who were raising\nthe bruised magician to his legs, but wandered away instead through the\ndeepening twilight towards the city over meadows whose damp, soft\nfragrance loaded the air with sleepy pleasure, neither of us saying a\nword till the dusk deepened and the quick night descended, while we\ncame amongst the gardened houses, the thousand lights of an unreal city\nrising like a jewelled bank before us, and there An said she would\nleave me for a time, meeting me again in the palace square later on,\n\"To see Princess Heru read the destinies of the year.\"\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed, \"more magic?  I have been brought up on more\nsubstantial mental stuff than this.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I would advise you to come to the square,\" persisted my\ncompanion.  \"It affects us all, and--who knows?--may affect you more\nthan any.\"\n\nTherein poor An was unconsciously wearing the cloak of prophesy\nherself, and, shrugging my shoulders good-humouredly, I kissed her\nchin, little realising, as I let her fingers slip from mine, that I\nshould see her no more.\n\nTurning back alone, through the city, through ways twinkling with\nmyriad lights as little lamps began to blink out amongst garlands and\nflower-decked booths on every hand, I walked on, lost in varying\nthoughts, until, fairly tired and hungry, I found myself outside a\nstall where many Martians stood eating and drinking to their hearts'\ncontent. I was known to none of them, and, forgetting past experience,\nwas looking on rather enviously, when there came a touch upon my arm,\nand--\n\n\"Are you hungry, sir?\" asked a bystander.\n\n\"Ay,\" I said, \"hungry, good friend, and with all the zest which an\nempty purse lends to that condition.\"\n\n\"Then here is what you need, sir, even from here the wine smells good,\nand the fried fruit would make a mouse's eye twinkle.  Why do you wait?\"\n\n\"Why wait?  Why, because though the rich man's dinner goes in at his\nmouth, the poor man must often be content to dine through his nose. I\ntell you I have nothing to get me a meal with.\"\n\nThe stranger seemed to speculate on this for a time, and then he said,\n\"I cannot fathom your meaning, sir.  Buying and selling, gold and\nmoney, all these have no meaning to me.  Surely the twin blessings of\nan appetite and food abundant ready and free before you are enough.\"\n\n\"What! free is it--free like the breakfast served out this morning?\"\n\n\"Why, of course,\" said the youth, with mild depreciation; \"everything\nhere is free.  Everything is his who will take it, without exception.\nWhat else is the good of a coherent society and a Government if it\ncannot provide you with so rudimentary a thing as a meal?\"\n\nWhereat joyfully I undid my belt, and, without nicely examining the\nargument, marched into the booth, and there put Martian hospitality to\nthe test, eating and drinking, but this time with growing wisdom, till\nI was a new man, and then, paying my leaving with a wave of the hand to\nthe yellow-girted one who dispensed the common provender, I sauntered\non again, caring little or nothing which way the road went, and soon\nacross the current of my meditations a peal of laughter broke,\naccompanied by the piping of a flute somewhere close at hand, and the\nnext minute I found myself amid a ring of light-hearted roisterers who\nwere linking hands for a dance to the music a curly-headed fellow was\nmaking close by.\n\nThey made me join them!  One rosey-faced damsel at the hither end of\nthe chain drew up to me, and, without a word, slipped her soft, baby\nfingers into my hand; on the other side another came with melting eyes,\nbreath like a bed of violets, and banked-up fun puckering her dainty\nmouth.  What could I do but give her a hand as well?  The flute began\nto gurgle anew, like a drinking spout in spring-time, and away we went,\nfaster and faster each minute, the boys and girls swinging themselves\nin time to the tune, and capering presently till their tender feet were\ntwinkling over the ground in gay confusion.  Faster and faster till, as\nthe infection of the dance spread even to the outside groups, I capered\ntoo.  My word! if they could have seen me that night from the deck of\nthe old Carolina, how they would have laughed--sword swinging,\ncoat-tails flying--faster and faster, round and round we went, till\nlimbs could stand no more; the gasping piper blew himself quite out,\nand the dance ended as abruptly as it commenced, the dancers melting\naway to join others or casting themselves panting on the turf.\n\nCertainly these Martian girls were blessed with an ingratiating\nsimplicity.  My new friend of the violet-scented breath hung back a\nlittle, then after looking at me demurely for a minute or two, like a\nchild that chooses a new playmate, came softly up, and, standing on\ntiptoe, kissed me on the cheek.  It was not unpleasant, so I turned the\nother, whereon, guessing my meaning, without the smallest hesitation,\nshe reached up again, and pressed her pretty mouth to my bronzed skin a\nsecond time.  Then, with a little sigh of satisfaction, she ran an arm\nthrough mine, saying, \"Comrade, from what country have you come? I\nnever saw one quite like you before.\"\n\n\"From what country had I come?\"  Again the frown dropped down upon my\nforehead.  Was I dreaming--was I mad?  Where indeed had I come from? I\nstared back over my shoulder, and there, as if in answer to my\nthought--there, where the black tracery of flowering shrubs waved in\nthe soft night wind, over a gap in the crumbling ivory ramparts, the\nsky was brightening.  As I looked into the centre of that glow, a\nplanet, magnified by the wonderful air, came swinging up, pale but\nsplendid, and mapped by soft colours--green, violet, and red.  I knew\nit on the minute, Heaven only knows how, but I knew it, and a desperate\nthrill of loneliness swept over me, a spasm of comprehension of the\nhorrible void dividing us. Never did yearning babe stretch arms more\nwistfully to an unattainable mother than I at that moment to my mother\nearth.  All her meanness and prosaicness was forgotten, all her\nimperfections and shortcomings; it was home, the one tangible thing in\nthe glittering emptiness of the spheres. All my soul went into my eyes,\nand then I sneezed violently, and turning round, found that sweet\ndamsel whose silky head nestled so friendly on my shoulder was tickling\nmy nose with a feather she had picked up.\n\nWomanlike, she had forgotten all about her first question, and now\nasked another, \"Will you come to supper with me, stranger?  'Tis nearly\nready, I think.\"\n\n\"To be able to say no to such an invitation, lady, is the first thing a\nyoung man should learn,\" I answered lightly; but then, seeing there was\nnothing save the most innocent friendliness in those hazel eyes, I went\non, \"but that stern rule may admit of variance.  Only, as it chances, I\nhave just supped at the public expense.  If, instead, you would be a\nsailor's sweetheart for an hour, and take me to this show of\nyours--your princess's benefit, or whatever it is--I shall be obliged;\nmy previous guide is hull down over the horizon, and I am clean out of\nmy reckoning in this crowd.\"\n\nBy way of reply, the little lady, light as an elf, took me by the\nfingertips, and, gleefully skipping forward, piloted me through the\nmazes of her city until we came out into the great square fronting on\nthe palace, which rose beyond it like a white chalk cliff in the dull\nlight. Not a taper showed anywhere round its circumference, but a\nmysterious kind of radiance like sea phosphorescence beamed from the\npalace porch. All was in such deathlike silence that the nails in my\n\"ammunition\" boots made an unpleasant clanking as they struck on the\nmarble pavement; yet, by the uncertain starlight, I saw, to my\nsurprise, the whole square was thronged with Martians, all facing\ntowards the porch, as still, graven images, and as voiceless, for once,\nas though they had indeed been marble. It was strange to see them\nsitting there in the twilight, waiting for I knew not what, and my\nfriend's voice at my elbow almost startled me as she said, in a\nwhisper, \"The princess knows you are in the crowd, and desires you to\ngo up upon the steps near where she will be.\"\n\n\"Who brought her message?\" I asked, gazing vaguely round, for none had\nspoken to us for an hour or more.\n\n\"No one,\" said my companion, gently pushing me up an open way towards\nthe palace steps left clear by the sitting Martians.  \"It came direct\nfrom her to me this minute.\"\n\n\"But how?\" I persisted.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the girl, \"if we stop to talk like this we shall not be\nplaced before she comes, and thus throw a whole year's knowledge out.\"\n\nSo, bottling my speculations, I allowed myself to be led up the first\nflight of worn, white steps to where, on the terrace between them and\nthe next flight leading directly to the palace portico, was a flat,\nhaving a circle about twenty feet across, inlaid upon the marble with\ndarker coloured blocks.  Inside that circle, as I sat down close by it\nin the twilight, showed another circle, and then a final one in whose\ninmost middle stood a tall iron tripod and something atop of it covered\nby a cloth.  And all round the outer circle were magic symbols--I\nstarted as I recognised the meaning of some of them--within these again\nthe inner circle held what looked like the representations of planets,\nending, as I have said, in that dished hollow made by countless\ndancers' feet, and its solitary tripod.  Back again, I glanced towards\nthe square where the great concourse--ten thousand of them,\nperhaps--were sitting mute and silent in the deepening shadows, then\nback to the magic circles, till the silence and expectancy of a strange\nscene began to possess me.\n\nShadow down below, star-dusted heaven above, and not a figure moving;\nwhen suddenly something like a long-drawn sigh came from the lips of\nthe expectant multitude, and I was aware every eye had suddenly turned\nback to the palace porch, where, as we looked, a figure, wrapped in\npale blue robes, appeared and stood for a minute, then stole down the\nsteps with an eagerness in every movement holding us spellbound.  I\nhave seen many splendid pageants and many sights, each of which might\nbe the talk of a lifetime, but somehow nothing ever so engrossing, so\nthrilling, as that ghostly figure in flowing robes stealing across the\npiazza in starlight and silence--the princess of a broken kingdom, the\npriestess of a forgotten faith coming to her station to perform a\njugglery of which she knew not even the meaning.  It was my versatile\nfriend Heru, and with quick, incisive steps, her whole frame ambent for\nthe time with the fervour of her mission, she came swiftly down to\nwithin a dozen yards of where I stood.  Heru, indeed, but not the same\nprincess as in the morning; an inspired priestess rather, her slim body\nwrapped in blue and quivering with emotion, her face ashine with\nDelphic fire, her hair loose, her feet bare, until at last when, as she\nstood within the limit of the magic circle, her white hands upon her\nbreast, her eyes flashing like planets themselves in the starshine she\nlooked so ghostly and unreal I felt for a minute I was dreaming.\n\nThen began a strange, weird dance amongst the imagery of the rings,\nover which my earth planet was beginning to throw a haze of light. At\nfirst it was hardly more than a walk, a slow procession round the twin\ncircumferences of the centred tripod.  But soon it increased to an\nextraordinary graceful measure, a cadenced step without music or sound\nthat riveted my eyes to the dancer.  Presently I saw those mystic,\ntwinkling feet of hers--as the dance became swifter--were performing a\nmeasured round amongst the planet signs--spelling out something, I knew\nnot what, with quick, light touch amongst the zodiac figures, dancing\nout a soundless invocation of some kind as a dumb man might spell a\nmessage by touching letters.  Quicker and quicker, for minute after\nminute, grew the dance, swifter and swifter the swing of the light blue\ndrapery as the priestess, with eager face and staring eyes, swung\npanting round upon her orbit, and redder and redder over the city tops\nrose the circumference of the earth.  It seemed to me all the silent\nmultitude were breathing heavily as we watched that giddy dance, and\nwhatever THEY felt, all my own senses seemed to be winding up upon that\nrevolving figure as thread winds on a spindle.\n\n\"When will she stop?\" I whispered to my friend under my breath.\n\n\"When the earth-star rests in the roof-niche of the temple it is\nclimbing,\" she answered back.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"On the tripod is a globe of water.  In it she will see the destiny of\nthe year, and will tell us.  The whiter the water stays, the better for\nus; it never varies from white.  But we must not talk; see! she is\nstopping.\"\n\nAnd as I looked back, the dance was certainly ebbing now with such\nsmoothly decreasing undulations, that every heart began to beat calmer\nin response.  There was a minute or two of such slow cessation, and\nthen to say she stopped were too gross a description.  Motion rather\ndied away from her, and the priestess grounded as smoothly as a ship\ngrounds in fine weather on a sandy bank.  There she was at last,\ncrouched behind the tripod, one corner of the cloth covering it grasped\nin her hand, and her eyes fixed on the shining round just poised upon\nthe distant run.\n\nKeenly the girl watched it slide into zenith, then the cloth was\nsnatched from the tripod-top.  As it fell it uncovered a beautiful and\nperfect globe of clear white glass, a foot or so in diameter, and\nobviously filled with the thinnest, most limpid water imaginable.  At\nfirst it seemed to me, who stood near to the priestess of Mars, with\nthat beaming sphere directly between us, and the newly risen world,\nthat its smooth and flawless face was absolutely devoid of sign or\ncolouring.  Then, as the distant planet became stronger in the\nmagnifying Martian air, or my eyes better accustomed to that sudden\nnucleus of brilliancy, a delicate and infinitely lovely network of\ncolours came upon it. They were like the radiant prisms that sometimes\nflush the surface of a bubble more than aught else for a time.  But as\nI watched that mosaic of yellow and purple creep softly to and fro upon\nthe globe it seemed they slowly took form and meaning.  Another minute\nor two and they had certainly congealed into a settled plan, and then,\nas I stared and wondered, it burst upon me in a minute that I was\nlooking upon a picture, faithful in every detail, of the world I stood\non; all its ruddy forests, its sapphire sea, both broad and narrow\nones, its white peaked mountains, and unnumbered islands being mapped\nout with startling clearness for a spell upon that beaming orb.\n\nThen a strange thing happened.  Heru, who had been crouching in a\ntremulous heap by the tripod, rose stealthily and passed her hands a\nfew times across the sphere.  Colour and picture vanished at her touch\nlike breath from a mirror.  Again all was clear and pellucid.\n\n\"Now,\" said my companion, \"now listen!  For Heru reads the destiny; the\nwhiter the globe stays the better for us--\" and then I felt her hand\ntighten on mine with a startled grasp as the words died away upon her\nlips.\n\nEven as the girl spoke, the sphere, which had been beaming in the\ncentre of the silent square like a mighty white jewel, began to flush\nwith angry red.  Redder and redder grew the gleam--a fiery glow which\nseemed curdling in the interior of the round as though it were filled\nwith flame; redder and redder, until the princess, staring into it,\nseemed turned against the jet-black night behind, into a form of molten\nmetal. A spasm of terror passed across her as she stared; her limbs\nstiffened; her frightened hands were clutched in front, and she stood\ncowering under that great crimson nucleus like one bereft of power and\nlife, and lost to every sense but that of agony.  Not a syllable came\nfrom her lips, not a movement stirred her body, only that dumb, stupid\nstare of horror, at the something she saw in the globe.  What could I\ndo?  I could not sit and see her soul come out at her frightened eyes,\nand not a Martian moved a finger to her rescue; the red shine gleamed\non empty faces, tier above tier, and flung its broad flush over the\nendless rank of open-mouthed spectators, then back I looked to\nHeru--that winsome little lady for whom, you will remember, I had\nalready more than a passing fancy--and saw with a thrill of emotion\nthat while she still kept her eyes on the flaming globe like one in a\nhorrible dream her hands were slowly, very slowly, rising in\nsupplication to ME! It was not vanity. There was no mistaking the\ndirection of that silent, imploring appeal.\n\nNot a man of her countrymen moved, not even black Hath!  There was not\na sound in the world, it seemed, but the noisy clatter of my own\nshoenails on the marble flags.  In the great red eye of that unholy\nglobe the Martians glimmered like a picture multitude under the red\ncliff of their ruined palace.  I glared round at them with contempt for\na minute, then sprang forward and snatched the princess up.  It was\nlike pulling a flower up by the roots.  She was stiff and stark when I\nlay hold of her, but when I tore her from the magic ground she suddenly\ngave a piercing shriek, and fainted in my arms.\n\nThen as I turned upon my heels with her upon my breast my foot caught\nupon the cloths still wound about the tripod of the sphere.  Over went\nthat implement of a thousand years of sorcery, and out went the red\nfire. But little I cared--the princess was safe!  And up the palace\nsteps, amidst a low, wailing hum of consternation from the recovering\nMartians, I bore that bundle of limp and senseless loveliness up into\nthe pale shine of her own porch, and there, laying her down upon a\ncouch, watched her recover presently amongst her women with a varied\nassortment of emotions tingling in my veins.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nBeyond the first flutter of surprise, the Martians had shown no\ninterest in the abrupt termination of the year's divinations.  They\nmelted away, a trifle more silently perhaps than usual, when I\nshattered the magic globe, but with their invariable indifference, and\nhaving handed the reviving Heru over to some women who led her away,\napparently already half forgetful of the things that had just happened,\nI was left alone on the palace steps, not even An beside me, and only\nthe shadow of a passerby now and then to break the solitude.  Whereon a\ngreat loneliness took hold upon me, and, pacing to and fro along the\nancient terrace with bent head and folded arms, I bewailed my fate. To\nand fro I walked, heedless and melancholy, thinking of the old world,\nthat was so far and this near world so distant from me in everything\nmaking life worth living, thinking, as I strode gloomily here and\nthere, how gladly I would exchange these poor puppets and the mockery\nof a town they dwelt in, for a sight of my comrades and a corner in the\npoorest wine-shop salon in New York or 'Frisco; idly speculating why,\nand how, I came here, as I sauntered down amongst the glistening,\nshell-like fragments of the shattered globe, and finding no answer.\nHow could I? It was too fair, I thought, standing there in the open;\nthere was a fatal sweetness in the air, a deadly sufficiency in the\nbeauty of everything around falling on the lax senses like some sleepy\ndraught of pleasure. Not a leaf stirred, the wide purple roof of the\nsky was unbroken by the healthy promise of a cloud from rim to rim, the\nsplendid country, teeming with its spring-time richness, lay in rank\nperfection everywhere; and just as rank and sleek and passionless were\nthose who owned it.\n\nWhy, even I, who yesterday was strong, began to come under the spell of\nit.  But yesterday the spirit of the old world was still strong within\nme, yet how much things were now changing.  The well-strung muscles\nloosening, the heart beating a slower measure, the busy mind drowsing\noff to listlessness.  Was I, too, destined to become like these? Was\nthe red stuff in my veins to be watered down to pallid Martian sap? Was\nambition and hope to desert me, and idleness itself become laborious,\nwhile life ran to seed in gilded uselessness?  Little did I guess how\nunnecessary my fears were, or of the incredible fairy tale of adventure\ninto which fate was going to plunge me.\n\nStill engrossed the next morning by these thoughts, I decided I would\ngo to Hath.  Hath was a man--at least they said so--he might sympathise\neven though he could not help, and so, dressing finished, I went down\ntowards the innermost palace whence for an hour or two had come sounds\nof unwonted bustle.  Asking for the way occasionally from sleepy folk\nlolling about the corridors, waiting as it seemed for their breakfasts\nto come to them, and embarrassed by the new daylight, I wandered to and\nfro in the labyrinths of that stony ant-heap until I chanced upon a\ncurtained doorway which admitted to a long chamber, high-roofed, ample\nin proportions, with colonnades on either side separated from the main\naisle by rows of flowery figures and emblematic scroll-work, meaning I\nknew not what.  Above those pillars ran a gallery with many windows\nlooking out over the ruined city.  While at the further end of the\nchamber stood three broad steps leading to a dais.  As I entered, the\nwhole place was full of bustling girls, their yellow garments like a\nbed of flowers in the sunlight trickling through the casements, and all\nintent on the spreading of a feast on long tables ranged up and down\nthe hall. The morning light streamed in on the white cloths.  It\nglittered on the glass and the gold they were putting on the trestles,\nand gave resplendent depths of colour to the ribbon bands round the\npillars.  All were so busy no one noticed me standing in the twilight\nby the door, but presently, laying a hand on a worker's shoulder, I\nasked who they banqueted for, and why such unwonted preparation?\n\n\"It is the marriage-feast tonight, stranger, and a marvel you did not\nknow it.  You, too, are to be wed.\"\n\n\"I had not heard of it, damsel; a paternal forethought of your\nGovernment, I suppose?  Have you any idea who the lady is?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" she answered laughingly.  \"That is the secret of\nthe urn.  Meanwhile, we have set you a place at the table-head near\nPrincess Heru, and tonight you dip and have your chance like all of\nthem; may luck send you a rosy bride, and save her from Ar-hap.\"\n\n\"Ay, now I remember; An told me of this before; Ar-hap is the sovereign\nwith whom your people have a little difference, and shares unbidden in\nthe free distribution of brides to-night.  This promises to be\ninteresting; depend on it I will come; if you will keep me a place\nwhere I can hear the speeches, and not forget me when the turtle soup\ngoes round, I shall be more than grateful.  Now to another matter.  I\nwant to get a few minutes with your President, Prince Hath.  He\nconcentrates the fluid intelligence of this sphere, I am told.  Where\ncan I find him?\"\n\n\"He is drunk, in the library, sir!\"\n\n\"My word!  It is early in the day for that, and a singular conjunction\nof place and circumstance.\"\n\n\"Where,\" said the girl, \"could he safer be?  We can always fetch him if\nwe want him, and sunk in blue oblivion he will not come to harm.\"\n\n\"A cheerful view, Miss, which is worthy of the attention of our\nreformers. Nevertheless, I will go to him.  I have known men tell more\ntruth in that state than in any other.\"\n\nThe servitor directed me to the library, and after desolate wanderings\nup crumbling steps and down mouldering corridors, sunny and lovely in\ndecay, I came to the immense lumber-shed of knowledge they had told me\nof, a city of dead books, a place of dusty cathedral aisles stored with\nforgotten learning.  At a table sat Hath the purposeless, enthroned in\nleather and vellum, snoring in divine content amongst all that wasted\nlabour, and nothing I could do was sufficient to shake him into\nsemblance of intelligence.  So perforce I turned away till he should\nhave come to himself, and wandering round the splendid litter of a\nnoble library, presently amongst the ruck of volumes on the floor,\namongst those lordly tomes in tattered green and gold, and ivory, my\neye lit upon a volume propped up curiously on end, and going to it\nthrough the confusion I saw by the dried fruit rind upon the sticks\nsupporting it, that the grave and reverend tome was set to catch a\nmouse!  It was a splendid book when I looked more closely, bound as a\nking might bind his choicest treasure, the sweet-scented leather on it\nwas no doubt frayed; the golden arabesques upon the covers had long\nsince shed their eyes of inset gems, the jewelled clasp locking its\nlearning up from vulgar gaze was bent and open.  Yet it was a lordly\ntome with an odour of sanctity about it, and lifting it with\ndifficulty, I noticed on its cover a red stain of mouse's blood. Those\nwho put it to this quaint use of mouse-trap had already had some sport,\nbut surely never was a mouse crushed before under so much learning. And\nwhile I stood guessing at what the book might hold within, Heru, the\nprincess, came tripping in to me, and with the abrupt familiarity of\nher kind, laid a velvet hand upon my wrist, conned the title over to\nherself.\n\n\"What does it say, sweet girl?\" I asked.  \"The matter is learned, by\nits feel,\" and that maid, pursing up her pretty lips, read the title to\nme--\"The Secret of the Gods.\"\n\n\"The Secret of the Gods,\" I murmured.  \"Was it possible other worlds\nhad struggled hopelessly to come within the barest ken of that great\nknowledge, while here the same was set to catch a mouse with?\"\n\nI said, \"Silver-footed, sit down and read me a passage or two,\" and\npropping the mighty volume upon a table drew a bench before it and\npulled her down beside me.\n\n\"Oh! a horrid, dry old book for certain,\" cried that lady, her pink\nfingertips falling as lightly on the musty leaves as almond petals on\nMarch dust.  \"Where shall I begin?  It is all equally dull.\"\n\n\"Dip in,\" was my answer.  \"'Tis no great matter where, but near the\nbeginning.  What says the writer of his intention?  What sets he out to\nprove?\"\n\n\"He says that is the Secret of the First Great Truth, descended\nstraight to him--\"\n\n\"Many have said so much, yet have lied.\"\n\n\"He says that which is written in his book is through him but not of\nhim, past criticism and beyond cavil.  'Tis all in ancient and crabbed\ncharacters going back to the threshold of my learning, but here upon\nthis passage-top where they are writ large I make them out to say,\n'ONLY THE MAN WHO HAS DIED MANY TIMES BEGINS TO LIVE.'\"\n\n\"A pregnant passage!  Turn another page, and try again; I have an\ninkling of the book already.\"\n\n\"'Tis poor, silly stuff,\" said the girl, slipping a hand covertly into\nmy own.  \"Why will you make me read it?  I have a book on pomatums\nworth twice as much as this.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, dip in again, dear lady.  What says the next heading?\"\nAnd with a little sigh at the heaviness of her task, Heru read out:\n\"SOMETIMES THE GODS THEMSELVES FORGET THE ANSWERS TO THEIR OWN RIDDLES.\"\n\n\"Lady, I knew it!\n\n\"All this is still preliminary to the great matter of the book, but the\nmutterings of the priest who draws back the curtains of the shrine--and\nhere, after the scribe has left these two yellow pages blank as though\nto set a space of reverence between himself and what comes next--here\nspeaks the truth, the voice, the fact of all life.\"  But \"Oh!  Jones,\"\nshe said, turning from the dusty pages and clasping her young,\nmilk-warm hands over mine and leaning towards me until her blushing\ncheek was near to my shoulder and the incense of her breath upon me.\n\"Oh!  Gulliver Jones,\" she said.  \"Make me read no more; my soul\nrevolts from the task, the crazy brown letters swim before my eyes.  Is\nthere no learning near at hand that would be pleasanter reading than\nthis silly book of yours? What, after all,\" she said, growing bolder at\nthe sound of her own voice, \"what, after all, is the musty reticence of\ngods to the whispered secret of a maid?  Jones, splendid stranger for\nwhom all men stand aside and women look over shoulders, oh, let me be\nyour book!\" she whispered, slipping on to my knee and winding her arms\nround my neck till, through the white glimmer of her single vest, I\ncould feel her heart beating against mine.  \"Newest and dearest of\nfriends, put by this dreary learning and look in my eyes; is there\nnothing to be spelt out there?\"\n\nAnd I was constrained to do as she bid me, for she was as fresh as an\nalmond blossom touched by the sun, and looking down into two swimming\nblue lakes where shyness and passion were contending--books easy\nenough, in truth, to be read, I saw that she loved me, with the\nunconventional ardour of her nature.\n\nIt was a pleasant discovery, if its abruptness was embarrassing, for\nshe was a maid in a thousand; and half ashamed and half laughing I let\nher escalade me, throwing now and then a rueful look at the Secret of\nthe Gods, and all that priceless knowledge treated so unworthily.\n\nWhat else could I do?  Besides, I loved her myself!  And if there was a\nmomentary chagrin at having yonder golden knowledge put off by this\nlovely interruption, yet I was flesh and blood, the gods could\nwait--they had to wait long and often before, and when this sweet\ninterpreter was comforted we would have another try.  So it happened I\ntook her into my heart and gave her the answer she asked for.\n\nFor a long time we sat in the dusky grandeur of the royal library, my\nmind revolving between wonder and admiration of the neglected knowledge\nall about, and the stirrings of a new love, while Heru herself, lapsed\nagain into Martian calm, lay half sleeping on my shoulder, but\npresently, unwinding her arms, I put her down.\n\n\"There, sweetheart,\" I whispered, \"enough of this for the moment;\ntonight, perhaps, some more, but while we are here amongst all this\nlordly litter, I can think of nothing else.\"  Again I bid her turn the\npages, noting as she did so how each chapter was headed by the coloured\nconfiguration of a world.  Page by page we turned of crackling\nparchment, until by chance, at the top of one, my eye caught a coloured\nround I could not fail to recognise--'twas the spinning button on the\nblue breast of the immeasurable that yesterday I inhabited.  \"Read\nhere,\" I cried, clapping my finger upon the page midway down, where\nthere were some signs looking like Egyptian writing.  \"Says this quaint\ndabbler in all knowledge anything of Isis, anything of Phra, of Ammon,\nof Ammon Top?\"\n\n\"And who was Isis? who Ammon Top?\" asked the lady.\n\n\"Nay, read,\" I answered, and down the page her slender fingers went\nawandering till at a spot of knotted signs they stopped.  \"Why, here is\nsomething about thy Isis,\" exclaimed Heru, as though amused at my\nperspicuity.  \"Here, halfway down this chapter of earth-history, it\nsays,\" and putting one pink knee across the other to better prop the\nbook she read:\n\n\"And the priests of Thebes were gone; the sand stood untrampled on the\ntemple steps a thousand years; the wild bees sang the song of\ndesolation in the ears of Isis; the wild cats littered in the stony lap\nof Ammon; ay, another thousand years went by, and earth was tilled of\nunseen hands and sown with yellow grain from Paradise, and the thin\nveil that separates the known from the unknown was rent, and men walked\nto and fro.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" I said.\n\n\"Nay,\" laughed the other, \"the little mice in their eagerness have been\nbefore you--see, all this corner is gnawed away.\"\n\n\"Read on again,\" I said, \"where the page is whole; those sips of\nknowledge you have given make me thirsty for more.  There, begin where\nthis blazonry of initialed red and gold looks so like the carpet spread\nby the scribe for the feet of a sovereign truth--what says he here?\"\nAnd she, half pouting to be set back once more to that task, half\nwondering as she gazed on those magic letters, let her eyes run down\nthe page, then began:\n\n\"And it was the Beginning, and in the centre void presently there came\na nucleus of light: and the light brightened in the grey primeval\nmorning and became definite and articulate.  And from the midst of that\nnatal splendour, behind which was the Unknowable, the life came\nhitherward; from the midst of that nucleus undescribed, undescribable,\nthere issued presently the primeval sigh that breathed the breath of\nlife into all things.  And that sigh thrilled through the empty spaces\nof the illimitable: it breathed the breath of promise over the frozen\nhills of the outside planets where the night-frost had lasted without\nbeginning: and the waters of ten thousand nameless oceans, girding\nnameless planets, were stirred, trembling into their depth.  It crossed\nthe illimitable spaces where the herding aerolites swirl forever\nthrough space in the wake of careering world, and all their whistling\nwings answered to it. It reverberated through the grey wastes of\nvacuity, and crossed the dark oceans of the Outside, even to the black\nshores of the eternal night beyond.\n\n\"And hardly had echo of that breath died away in the hollow of the\nheavens and the empty wombs of a million barren worlds, when the light\nbrightened again, and drawing in upon itself became definite and took\nform, and therefrom, at the moment of primitive conception, there\ncame--\"\n\nAnd just then, as she had read so far as that, when all my faculties\nwere aching to know what came next--whether this were but the idle\nscribbling of a vacuous fool, or something else--there rose the sound\nof soft flutes and tinkling bells in the corridors, as seneschals\nwandered piping round the palace to call folk to meals, a smell of\nroast meat and grilling fish as that procession lifted the curtains\nbetween the halls, and--\n\n\"Dinner!\" shouted my sweet Martian, slapping the covers of The Secret\nof the Gods together and pushing the stately tome headlong from the\ntable. \"Dinner!  'Tis worth a hundred thousand planets to the hungry!\"\n\nNothing I could say would keep her, and, scarcely knowing whether to\nlaugh or to be angry at so unseemly an interruption, but both being\npurposeless I dug my hands into my pockets, and somewhat sulkily\nrefusing Heru's invitation to luncheon in the corridor (Navy rations\nhad not fitted my stomach for these constant debauches of gossamer\nfood), strolled into the town again in no very pleasant frame of mind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIt was only at moments like these I had any time to reflect on my\ncircumstances or that giddy chance which had shot me into space in this\nfashion, and, frankly, the opportunities, when they did come, brought\nsuch an extraordinary depressing train of thought, I by no means\ninvited them.  Even with the time available the occasion was always\nawry for such reflection.  These dainty triflers made sulking as\nimpossible amongst them as philosophy in a ballroom.  When I stalked\nout like that from the library in fine mood to moralise and\napostrophise heaven in a way that would no doubt have looked fine upon\nthese pages, one sprightly damsel, just as the gloomy rhetoric was\nbursting from my lips, thrust a flower under my nose whose scent\nbrought on a violent attack of sneezing, her companions joining hands\nand dancing round me while they imitated my agony.  Then, when I burst\naway from them and rushed down a narrow arcade of crumbling mansions,\nanother stopped me in mid-career, and taking the honey-stick she was\nsucking from her lips, put it to mine, like a pretty, playful child.\nAnother asked me to dance, another to drink pink oblivion with her, and\nso on.  How could one lament amongst all this irritating cheerfulness?\n\nAn might have helped me, for poor An was intelligent for a Martian, but\nshe had disappeared, and the terrible vacuity of life in the planet was\nforced upon me when I realised that possessing no cognomen, no fixed\naddress, or rating, it would be the merest chance if I ever came across\nher again.\n\nLooking for my friendly guide and getting more and more at sea amongst\na maze of comely but similar faces, I made chance acquaintance with\nanother of her kind who cheerfully drank my health at the Government's\nexpense, and chatted on things Martian.  She took me to see a funeral\nby way of amusement, and I found these people floated their dead off on\nflower-decked rafts instead of burying them, the send-offs all taking\nplace upon a certain swift-flowing stream, which carried the dead away\ninto the vast region of northern ice, but more exactly whither my\ninformant seemed to have no idea.  The voyager on this occasion was\nold, and this brought to my mind the curious fact that I had observed\nfew children in the city, and no elders, all, except perhaps Hath,\nbeing in a state of sleek youthfulness.  My new friend explained the\npeculiarity by declaring Martians ripened with extraordinary rapidity\nfrom infancy to the equivalent of about twenty-five years of age, with\nus, and then remained at that period however long they might live; Only\nwhen they died did their accumulated seasons come upon them; the girl\nturning pale, and wringing her pretty hands in sympathetic concern when\nI told her there was a land where decrepitude was not so happily\npostponed.  The Martians, she said, arranged their calendar by the\nvarying colours of the seasons, and loved blue as an antidote to the\ngenerally red and rusty character of their soil.\n\nDiscussing such things as these we lightly squandered the day away, and\nI know of nothing more to note until the evening was come again: that\nwonderful purple evening which creeps over the outer worlds at sunset,\na seductive darkness gemmed with ten thousand stars riding so low in\nthe heaven they seem scarcely more than mast high.  When that hour was\ncome my friend tiptoed again to my cheek, and then, pointing to the\npalace and laughingly hoping fate would send me a bride \"as soft as\ncatkin and as sweet as honey,\" slipped away into the darkness.\n\nThen I remembered all on a sudden this was the connubial evening of my\nsprightly friends--the occasion when, as An had told me, the Government\nconstituted itself into a gigantic matrimonial agency, and, with the\ncheerful carelessness of the place, shuffled the matrimonial pack anew,\nand dealt a fresh hand to all the players.  Now I had no wish to avail\nmyself of a sailor's privilege of a bride in every port, but surely\nthis game would be interesting enough to see, even if I were but a\ndisinterested spectator.  As a matter of fact I was something more than\nthat, and had been thinking a good deal of Heru during the day.  I do\nnot know whether I actually aspired to her hand--that were a large\norder, even if there had been no suspicion in my mind she was already\nbespoke in some vague way by the invisible Hath, most abortive of\nprinces.  But she was undeniably a lovely girl; the more one thought of\nher the more she grew upon the fancy, and then the preference she had\nshown myself was very gratifying.  Yes, I would certainly see this\nquaint ceremonial, even if I took no leading part in it.\n\nThe great centre hall of the palace was full of a radiant light\nbringing up its ruined columns and intruding creepers to the best\neffect when I entered.  Dinner also was just being served, as they\nwould say in another, and alas! very distant place, and the whole\nbuilding thronged with folk. Down the centre low tables with room for\nfour hundred people were ranged, but they looked quaint enough since\nbut two hundred were sitting there, all brand-new bachelors about to be\nturned into brand new Benedicts, and taking it mightily calmly it\nseemed.  Across the hall-top was a raised table similarly arranged and\nornamented; and entering into the spirit of the thing, and little\nguessing how stern a reality was to come from the evening, I sat down\nin a vacant place near to the dais, and only a few paces from where the\npale, ghost-eyed Hath was already seated.\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards music began to buzz all about the\nhall--music of the kind the people loved which always seemed to me as\nthough it were exuding from the tables and benches, so disembodied and\ndifficult it was to locate; all the sleepy gallants raised their\nflower-encircled heads at the same time, seizing their wine-cups,\nalready filled to the brim, and the door at the bottom of the hall\nopening, the ladies, preceded by one carrying a mysterious vase covered\nwith a glittering cloth, came in.\n\nNow, being somewhat thirsty, I had already drunk half the wine in my\nbeaker, and whether it was that draught, drugged as all Martian wines\nare, or the sheer loveliness of the maids themselves, I cannot say, but\nas the procession entered, and, dividing, circled round under the\ncolonnades of the hall, a sensation of extraordinary felicity came over\nme--an emotion of divine contentment purged of all grossness--and I\nstared and stared at the circling loveliness, gossamer-clad,\nflower-girdled, tripping by me with vapid delight.  Either the wine was\nbudding in my head, or there was little to choose from amongst them,\nfor had any of those ladies sat down in the vacant place beside me, I\nshould certainly have accepted her as a gift from heaven, without\nquestion or cavil.  But one after another they slipped by, modestly\ntaking their places in the shadows until at last came Princess Heru,\nand at the sight of her my soul was stirred.\n\nShe came undulating over the white marble, the loveliness of her fairy\nperson dimmed but scarcely hidden by a robe of softest lawn in colour\nlike rose-petals, her eyes aglitter with excitement and a charming\nblush upon her face.\n\nShe came straight up to me, and, resting a dainty hand upon my\nshoulder, whispered, \"Are you come as a spectator only, dear Mr. Jones,\nor do you join in our custom tonight?\"\n\n\"I came only as a bystander, lady, but the fascination of the\nopportunity is deadly--\"\n\n\"And have you any preference?\"--this in the softest little voice from\nsomewhere in the nape of my neck.  \"Strangers sometimes say there are\nfair women in Seth.\"\n\n\"None--till you came; and now, as was said a long time ago, 'All is\ndross that is not Helen.'  Dearest lady,\" I ran on, detaining her by\nthe fingertips and gazing up into those shy and star-like eyes, \"must I\nindeed put all the hopes your kindness has roused in me these last few\ndays to a shuffle in yonder urn, taking my chance with all these lazy\nfellows?  In that land whereof I was, we would not have had it so, we\nloaded our dice in these matters, a strong man there might have a\nwilling maid though all heaven were set against him!  But give me\nleave, sweet lady, and I will ruffle with these fellows; give me a\nglance and I will barter my life for your billet when it is drawn, but\nto stand idly by and see you won by a cold chance, I cannot do it.\"\n\nThat lady laughed a little and said, \"Men make laws, dear Jones, for\nwomen to keep.  It is the rule, and we must not break it.\"  Then,\ngently tugging at her imprisoned fingers and gathering up her skirts to\ngo, she added, \"But it might happen that wit here were better than\nsword.\" Then she hesitated, and freeing herself at last slipped from my\nside, yet before she was quite gone half turned again and whispered so\nlow that no one but I could hear it, \"A golden pool, and a silver fish,\nand a line no thicker than a hair!\" and before I could beg a meaning of\nher, had passed down the hall and taken a place with the other\nexpectant damsels.\n\n\"A golden pool,\" I said to myself, \"a silver fish, and a line of hair.\"\nWhat could she mean?  Yet that she meant something, and something\nclearly of importance, I could not doubt.  \"A golden pool, and a silver\nfish--\" I buried my chin in my chest and thought deeply but without\neffect while the preparations were made and the fateful urn, each maid\nhaving slipped her name tablet within, was brought down to us, covered\nin a beautiful web of rose-coloured tissue, and commenced its round,\npassing slowly from hand to hand as each of those handsome, impassive,\nfawn-eyed gallants lifted a corner of the web in turn and helped\nthemselves to fate.\n\n\"A golden pool,\" I muttered, \"and a silver fish\"--so absorbed in my own\nthoughts I hardly noticed the great cup begin its journey, but when it\nhad gone three or four places the glitter of the lights upon it caught\nmy eye. It was of pure gold, round-brimmed, and circled about with a\nstring of the blue convolvulus, which implies delight to these people.\nAy! and each man was plunging his hand into the dark and taking in his\nturn a small notch-edged mother-of-pearl billet from it that flashed\nsoft and silvery as he turned it in his hand to read the name engraved\nin unknown characters thereon.  \"Why,\" I said, with a start, \"surely\nTHIS might be the golden pool and these the silver fish--but the\nhair-fine line?\" And again I meditated deeply, with all my senses on\nthe watch.\n\nSlowly the urn crept round, and as each man took a ticket from it, and\npassed it, smiling, to the seneschal behind him, that official read out\nthe name upon it, and a blushing damsel slipped from the crowd above,\ncrossing over to the side of the man with whom chance had thus lightly\nlinked her for the brief Martian year, and putting her hands in his\nthey kissed before all the company, and sat down to their places at the\ntable as calmly as country folk might choose partners at a village fair\nin hay-time.\n\nBut not so with me.  Each time a name was called I started and stared\nat the drawer in a way which should have filled him with alarm had\nalarm been possible to the peace-soaked triflers, then turned to glance\nto where, amongst the women, my tender little princess was leaning\nagainst a pillar, with drooping head, slowly pulling a convolvulus bud\nto pieces.  None drew, though all were thinking of her, as I could tell\nin my fingertips.  Keener and keener grew the suspense as name after\nname was told and each slim white damsel skipped to the place allotted\nher. And all the time I kept muttering to myself about that \"golden\npool,\" wondering and wondering until the urn had passed half round the\ntables and was only some three men up from me--and then an idea flashed\nacross my mind.  I dipped my fingers in the scented water-basin on the\ntable, drying them carefully on a napkin, and waiting, outwardly as\ncalm as any, yet inwardly wrung by those tremors which beset all male\ncreation in such circumstances.\n\nAnd now at last it was my turn.  The great urn, blazing golden, through\nits rosy covering, was in front, and all eyes on me.  I clapped a\nsunburnt hand upon its top as though I would take all remaining in it\nto myself and stared round at that company--only her herself I durst\nnot look at!  Then, with a beating heart, I lifted a corner of the web\nand slipped my hand into the dark inside, muttering to myself as I did\nso, \"A golden pool, and a silver fish, and a line no thicker than a\nhair.\" I touched in turn twenty perplexing tablets and was no whit the\nwiser, and felt about the sides yet came to nothing, groping here and\nthere with a rising despair, until as my fingers, still damp and fine\nof touch, went round the sides a second time, yes! there was something,\nsomething in the hollow of the fluting, a thought, a thread, and yet\nenough.  I took it unseen, lifting it with infinite forbearance, and\nthe end was weighted, the other tablets slipped and rattled as from\ntheir midst, hanging to that one fine virgin hair, up came a pearly\nbillet.  I doubted no longer, but snapped the thread, and showed the\ntablet, heard Heru's name, read from it amongst the soft applause of\nthat luxurious company with all the unconcern I could muster.\n\nThere she was in a moment, lip to lip with me, before them all, her\neyes more than ever like planets from her native skies, and only the\nquick heave of her bosom, slowly subsiding like a ground swell after a\nstorm, remaining to tell that even Martian blood could sometimes beat\nquicker than usual!  She sat down in her place by me in the simplest\nway, and soon everything was as merry as could be.  The main meal came\non now, and as far as I could see those Martian gallants had extremely\ngood appetites, though they drank at first but little, wisely\nremembering the strength of their wines.  As for me, I ate of fishes\nthat never swam in earthly seas, and of strange fowl that never flapped\na way through thick terrestrial air, ate and drank as happy as a king,\nand falling each moment more and more in love with the wonderfully\nbeautiful girl at my side who was a real woman of flesh and blood I\nknew, yet somehow so dainty, so pink and white, so unlike other girls\nin the smoothness of her outlines, in the subtle grace of each\nunthinking attitude, that again and again I looked at her over the rim\nof my tankard half fearing she might dissolve into nothing, being the\nhalf-fairy which she was.\n\nPresently she asked, \"Did that deed of mine, the hair in the urn,\noffend you, stranger?\"\n\n\"Offend me, lady!\" I laughed.  \"Why, had it been the blackest crime\nthat ever came out of a perverse imagination it would have brought its\nown pardon with it; I, least of all in this room, have least cause to\nbe offended.\"\n\n\"I risked much for you and broke our rules.\"\n\n\"Why, no doubt that was so, but 'tis the privilege of your kind to have\nsome say in this little matter of giving and taking in marriage. I only\nmarvel that your countrywomen submit so tamely to the quaintest game of\nchance I ever played at.\n\n\"Ay, and it is women's nature no doubt to keep the laws which others\nmake, as you have said yourself.  Yet this rule, lady, is one broken\nwith more credit than kept, and if you have offended no one more than\nme, your penance is easily done.\"\n\n\"But I have offended some one,\" she said, laying her hand on mine with\ngentle nervousness in its touch, \"one who has the power to hurt, and\nenough energy to resent.  Hath, up there at the cross-table, have I\noffended deeply tonight, for he hoped to have me, and would have\ncompelled any other man to barter me for the maid chance assigned to\nhim; but of you, somehow, he is afraid--I have seen him staring at you,\nand changing colour as though he knew something no one else knows--\"\n\n\"Briefly, charming girl,\" I said, for the wine was beginning to sing in\nmy head, and my eyes were blinking stupidly--\"briefly, Hath hath thee\nnot, and there's an end of it.  I would spit a score of Haths, as these\nfigs are spit on this golden skewer, before I would relinquish a hair\nof your head to him, or to any man,\" and as everything about the great\nhall began to look gauzy and unreal through the gathering fumes of my\nconfusion, I smiled on that gracious lady, and began to whisper I know\nnot what to her, and whisper and doze, and doze--\n\nI know not how long afterwards it was, whether a minute or an hour, but\nwhen I lifted my head suddenly from the lady's shoulder all the place\nwas in confusion, every one upon their feet, the talk and the drinking\nceased, and all eyes turned to the far doorway where the curtains were\njust dropping again as I looked, while in front of them were standing\nthree men.\n\nThese newcomers were utterly unlike any others--a frightful vision of\nugly strength amidst the lolling loveliness all about.  Low of stature,\nbroad of shoulder, hairy, deep-chested, with sharp, twinkling eyes, set\nfar back under bushy eyebrows, retreating foreheads, and flat noses in\nfaces tanned to a dusky copper hue by exposure to every kind of weather\nthat racks the extreme Martian climate they were so opposite to all\nabout me, so quaint and grim amongst those mild, fair-skinned folk,\nthat at first I thought they were but a disordered creation of my fancy.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and stared and blinked, but no! they were real men, of\nflesh and blood, and now they had come down with as much stateliness as\ntheir bandy legs would admit of, into the full glare of the lights to\nthe centre table where Hath sat.  I saw their splendid apparel, the\ngreat strings of rudely polished gems hung round their hairy necks and\nwrists, the cunningly dyed skins of soft-furred animals, green and red\nand black, wherewith their limbs were swathed, and then I heard some\none by me whisper in a frightened tone, \"The envoys from over seas.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I thought sleepily to myself, \"so these are the ape-men of the\nwestern woods, are they?  Those who long ago vanquished my\nwhite-skinned friends and yearly come to claim their tribute.  Jove,\nwhat hay they must have made of them!  How those peach-skinned girls\nmust have screamed and the downy striplings by them felt their dimpled\nknees knock together, as the mad flood of barbarians came pouring over\nfrom the forest, and long ago stormed their citadels like a stream of\nred lava, as deadly, as irresistible, as remorseless!\"  And I lay\nasprawl upon my arms on the table watching them with the stupid\nindifference I thought I could so well afford.\n\nMeanwhile Hath was on foot, pale and obsequious like others in the\npresence of those dread ambassadors, but more collected, I thought.\nWith the deepest bows he welcomed them, handing them drink in a golden\nState cup, and when they had drunk (I heard the liquor running down\ntheir great throats, in the frightened hush, like water in a runnel on\na wet day), they wiped their fierce lips upon their furry sleeves, and\nthe leader began reciting the tribute for the year.  So much corn, so\nmuch wine--and very much it was--so many thousands ells of cloth and\nwebbing, and so much hammered gold, and sinah and lar, precious metal\nof which I knew nothing as yet; and ever as he went growling through\nthe list in his harsh animal voice, he refreshed his memory with a\ncoloured stick whereon a notch was made for every item, the woodmen not\nhaving come as yet, apparently, to the gentler art of written signs and\nsymbols. Longer and longer that caravan of unearned wealth stretched\nout before my fancy, but at last it was done, or all but done, and the\nhead envoy, passing the painted stick to a man behind, folded his bare,\nsinewy arms, upon which the red fell bristles as it does upon a\ngorilla's, across his ample chest, and, including us all in one general\nscowl, turned to Hath as he said--\n\n\"All this for Ar-hap, the wood-king, my master and yours; all this, and\nthe most beautiful woman here tonight at your tables!\"\n\n\"An item,\" I smiled stupidly to myself, for indeed I was very sleepy\nand had no nice perception of things, \"which shows his majesty with the\ntwo-pronged name is a jolly fellow after all, and knows wealth is\nincomplete without the crown and priming of all riches.  I wonder how\nthe Martian boys will like this postscript,\" and chin on hand, and eyes\nthat would hardly stay open, I watched to see what would happen next.\nThere was a little conversation between the prince and the ape-man;\nthen I saw Hath the traitor point in my direction and say--\n\n\"Since you ask and will be advised, then, mighty sir, there can be no\ndoubt of it, the most beautiful woman here tonight is undoubtedly she\nwho sits yonder by him in blue.\"\n\n\"A very pretty compliment!\" I thought, too dull to see what was coming\nquickly, \"and handsome of Hath, all things considered.\"\n\nAnd so I dozed and dozed, and then started, and stared!  Was I in my\nsenses?  Was I mad, or dreaming?  The drunkenness dropped from me like\na mantle; with a single, smothered cry I came to myself and saw that it\nwas all too true.  The savage envoy had come down the hall at Hath's\nvindictive prompting, had lifted my fair girl to her feet, and there,\neven as I looked, had drawn her, white as death, into the red circle of\nhis arm, and with one hand under her chin had raised her sweet face to\nwithin an inch of his, and was staring at her with small, ugly eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the enjoy, more interestedly than he had spoken yet, \"it\nwill do; the tribute is accepted--for Ar-hap, my master!\"  And taking\nshrinking Heru by the wrist, and laying a heavy hand upon her shoulder,\nhe was about to lead her up the hall.\n\nI was sober enough then.  I was on foot in an instant, and before all\nthe glittering company, before those simpering girls and pale Martian\nyouths, who sat mumbling their fingers, too frightened to lift their\neyes from off their half-finished dinners, I sprang at the envoy.  I\nstruck him with my clenched fist on the side of his bullet head, and he\nlet go of Heru, who slipped insensible from his hairy chest like a\nwhite cloud slipping down the slopes of a hill at sunrise, and turned\non me with a snort of rage. We stared at each other for a minute, and\nthen I felt the wine fumes roaring in my head; I rushed at him and\nclosed.  It was like embracing a mountain bull, and he responded with a\nhug that made my ribs crackle. For a minute we were locked together\nlike that, swinging here and there, and then getting a hand loose, I\nbelaboured him so unmercifully that he put his head down, and that was\nwhat I wanted.  I got a new hold of him as we staggered and plunged,\nroaring the while like the wild beasts we were, the teeth chattering in\nthe Martian heads as they watched us, and then, exerting all my\nstrength, lifted him fairly from his feet and with supreme effort swung\nhim up, shoulder high, and with a mighty heave hurled him across the\ntables, flung that ambassador, whom no Martian dared look upon,\ncrashing and sprawling through the gold and silver of the feast,\nwhirled him round with such a splendid send that bench and trestle,\ntankards and flagons, chairs and cloths and candelabras all went down\ninto thundering chaos with him, and the envoy only stayed when his\nsacred person came to harbour amongst the westral odds and ends, the\nsoiled linen, and dirty platters of our wedding feast.\n\nI remember seeing him there on hands and knees, and then the liquor I\nhad had would not be denied.  In vain I drew my hands across my\ndrooping eyelids, in vain I tried to master my knees that knocked\ntogether. The spell of the love-drink that Heru, blushing, had held to\nmy lips was on me.  Its soft, overwhelming influence rose like a\nprismatic fog between me and my enemy, everything again became hazy and\ndreamlike, and feebly calling on Heru, my chin dropped upon my chest,\nmy limbs relaxed, and I slipped down in drowsy oblivion before my rival.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThey must have carried me, still under the influence of wine fumes, to\nthe chamber where I slept that night, for when I woke the following\nmorning my surroundings were familiar enough, though a glorious maze of\nuncertainties rocked to and fro in my mind.\n\nWas it a real feast we had shared in overnight, or only a quaint dream?\nWas Heru real or only a lovely fancy?  And those hairy ruffians of whom\na horrible vision danced before my waking eyes, were they fancy too?\nNo, my wrists still ached with the strain of the tussle, the quaint,\nsad wine taste was still on my lips--it was all real enough, I decided,\nstarting up in bed; and if it was real where was the little princess?\nWhat had they done with her?  Surely they had not given her to the\nape-men--cowards though they were they could not have been cowards\nenough for that.  And as I wondered a keen, bright picture of the\nhapless maid as I saw her last blossomed before my mind's eye, the\nambassadors on either side holding her wrists, and she shrinking from\nthem in horror while her poor, white face turned to me for rescue in\ndesperate pleading--oh! I must find her at all costs; and leaping from\nbed I snatched up those trousers without which the best of heroes is\nnothing, and had hardly got into them when there came the patter of\nlight feet without and a Martian, in a hurry for once, with half a\ndozen others behind him, swept aside the curtains of my doorway.\n\nThey peeped and peered all about the room, then one said, \"Is Princess\nHeru with you, sir?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered roughly.  \"Saints alive, man, do you think I would\nhave you tumbling in here over each other's heels if she were?\"\n\n\"Then it must indeed have been Heru,\" he said, speaking in an awed\nvoice to his fellows, \"whom we saw carried down to the harbour at\ndaybreak by yonder woodmen,\" and the pink upon their pretty cheeks\nfaded to nothing at the suggestion.\n\n\"What!\" I roared, \"Heru taken from the palace by a handful of men and\nnone of you infernal rascals--none of you white-livered abortions\nlifted a hand to save her--curse on you a thousand times.  Out of my\nway, you churls!\"  And snatching up coat and hat and sword I rushed\nfuriously down the long, marble stairs just as the short Martian night\nwas giving place to lavender-coloured light of morning.  I found my way\nsomehow down the deserted corridors where the air was heavy with\naromatic vapours; I flew by curtained niches and chambers where amongst\nmounds of half-withered flowers the Martian lovers were slowly waking.\nDown into the banquethall I sped, and there in the twilight was the\nlitter of the feast still about--gold cups and silver, broken bread and\nmeat, the convolvulus flowers all turning their pallid faces to the\nrosy daylight, making pools of brightness between the shadows.  Amongst\nthe litter little sapphire-coloured finches were feeding, twittering\nmerrily to themselves as they hopped about, and here and there down the\nlong tables lay asprawl a belated reveller, his empty oblivion-phial\nbefore him, his curly head upon his arms, dreaming perhaps of last\nnight's feast and a neglected bride dozing dispassionate in some\ndistant chamber. But Heru was not there and little I cared for\ntwittering finches or sighing damsels.  With hasty feet I rushed down\nthe hall out into the cool, sweet air of the planet morning.\n\nThere I met one whom I knew, and he told me he had been among the crowd\nand had heard the woodmen had gone no farther than the river gate, that\nHeru was with them beyond a doubt.  I would not listen to more. \"Good!\"\nI shouted.  \"Get me a horse and just a handful of your sleek kindred\nand we will pull the prize from the bear's paw even yet! Surely,\" I\nsaid, turning to a knot of Martian youths who stood listening a few\nsteps away, \"surely some of you will come with me at this pinch? The\nbig bullies are very few; the sea runs behind them; the maid in their\nclutch is worth fighting for; it needs but one good onset, five\nminutes' gallantry, and she is ours again.  Think how fine it will look\nto bring her back before yon sleepy fellows have found their weapons.\nYou, there, with the blue tunic! you look a proper fellow, and\nsomething of a heart should beat under such gay wrappings, will you\ncome with me?\"\n\nBut blue-mantle, biting his thumbs, murmured he had not breakfasted yet\nand edged away behind his companions.  Wherever I looked eyes dropped\nand timid hands fidgeted as their owners backed off from my dangerous\nenthusiasm.  There was obviously no help to be had from them, and\nmeantime the precious moments were flying, so with a disdainful glance\nI turned on my heels and set off alone as hard as I could go for the\nharbour.\n\nBut it was too late.  I rushed through the marketplace where all was\nsilent and deserted; I ran on to the wharves beyond and they were empty\nsave for the litter and embers of the fires Ar-hap's men had made\nduring their stay; I dashed out to the landing-place, and there at the\nhythe the last boat-loads of the villains were just embarking, two\nboatloads of them twenty yards from shore, and another still upon the\nbeach. This latter was careening over as a dusky group of men lifted\naboard to a heap of tumbled silks and stuffs in the stern such a sweet\npiece of insensible merchandise as no man, I at least of all, could\nmistake. It was Heru herself, and the rogues were ladling her on board\nlike so much sandal-wood or cotton sheeting.  I did not wait for more,\nbut out came my sword, and yielding to a reckless impulse, for which\nperhaps last night's wine was as much to blame as anything, I sprang\ndown the steps and leapt aboard of the boat just as it was pushed off\nupon the swift tide. Full of Bersark rage, I cut one brawny\ncopper-coloured thief down, and struck another with my fist between the\neyes so that he went headlong into the water, sinking like lead, and\ndeep into the great target of his neighbour's chest I drove my blade.\nHad there been a man beside me, had there been but two or three of all\nthose silken triflers, too late come on the terraces above to watch, we\nmight have won.  But all alone what could I do?  That last red beast\nturned on my blade, and as he fell dragged me half down with him.  I\nstaggered up, and tugging the metal from him turned on the next.\n\nAt that moment the cause of all the turmoil, roused by the fighting,\ncame to herself, and sitting up on the piled plunder in the boat stared\nround for a moment with a childish horror at the barbarians whose prize\nshe was, then at me, then at the dead man at my feet whose blood was\nwelling in a red tide from the wound in his breast.  As the full\nmeaning of the scene dawned upon her she started to her feet, looking\nwonderfully beautiful amongst those dusky forms, and extending her\nhands to me began to cry in the most piteous way.  I sprang forward,\nand as I did so saw an ape-man clap his hairy paw over her mouth and\nface--it was like an eclipse of the moon by a red earth-shadow, I\nthought at the moment--and drag her roughly back, but that was about\nthe last I remembered.  As I turned to hit him standing on the slippery\nthwart, another rogue crept up behind and let drive with a club he had\nin hand.  The cudgel caught me sideways on the head, a glancing shot.\nI can recall a blaze of light, a strange medley of sounds in my ears,\nand then, clutching at a pile of stuffs as I fell, a tall bower of\nspray rising on either hand, and the cool shock of the blue sea as I\nplunged headlong in--but nothing after that!\n\nHow long after I know not, but presently a tissue of daylight crept\ninto my eyes, and I awoke again.  It was better than nothing perhaps,\nyet it was a poor awakening.  The big sun lay low down, and the day was\nall but done; so much I guessed as I rocked in that light with an\nundulating movement, and then as my senses returned more fully,\nrecognised with a start of wonder that I was still in the water,\nfloating on a swift current into the unknown on an air-filled pile of\nsilken stuffs which had been pulled down with me from the boat when I\ngot my ganging from yonder rascal's mace.  It was a wet couch, sodden\nand chilly, but as the freshening evening wind blew on my face and the\ndarkening water lapped against my forehead I revived more fully.\n\nWhere had we come to?  I turned an aching neck, and all along on both\nsides seemed to stretch steep, straight coasts about a mile or so\napart, in the shadow of the setting sun black as ebony.  Between the\ntwo the hampered water ran quickly, with, away on the right, some\nshallow sandy spits and islands covered with dwarf bushes--chilly,\ninhospitable-looking places they seemed as I turned my eyes upon them;\nbut he who rides helpless down an evening tide stands out for no great\nniceties of landing-place; could I but reach them they would make at\nleast a drier bed than this of mine, and at that thought, turning over,\nI found all my muscles as stiff as iron, the sinews of my neck and\nforearms a mass of agonies and no more fit to swim me to those reedy\nswamps, which now, as pain and hunger began to tell, seemed to wear the\naspects of paradise.\n\nWith a groan I dropped back upon my raft and watched the islands\nslipping by, while over my feet the southern sky darkened to purple.\nThere was no help there, but glancing round away on the left and a few\nfurlongs from me, I noticed on the surface of the water two converging\nstrands of brightness, an angle the point of which seemed to be coming\ntowards me.  Nearer it came and nearer, right across my road, until I\ncould see a black dot at the point, a head presently developed, then as\nwe approached the ears and antlers of a swimming stag.  It was a huge\nbeast as it loomed up against the glow, bigger than any mortal stag\never was--the kind of fellow-traveller no one would willingly accost,\nbut even if I had wished to get out of its path I had no power to do so.\n\nCloser and closer we came, one of us drifting helplessly, and the other\nswimming strongly for the islands.  When we were about a furlong apart\nthe great beast seemed to change its course, mayhap it took the\nwreckage on which I floated for an outlying shoal, something on which\nit could rest a space in that long swim.  Be this as it may, the beast\ncame hurtling down on me lip deep in the waves, a mighty brown head\nwith pricked ears that flicked the water from them now and then, small\nbright eyes set far back, and wide palmated antlers on a mighty\nforehead, like the dead branches of a tree.  What that Martian mountain\nelk had hoped for can only be guessed, what he met with was a tangle of\nfloating finery carrying a numbed traveller on it, and with a snort of\ndisappointment he turned again.\n\nIt was a poor chance, but better than nothing, and as he turned I tried\nto throw a strand of silk I had unwound from the sodden mass over his\nbranching tines.  Quick as thought the beast twisted his head aside and\ntossed his antlers so that the try was fruitless.  But was I to lose my\nonly chance of shore?  With all my strength I hurled myself upon him,\nmissing my clutch again by a hair's-breadth and going headlong into the\nsalt furrow his chest was turning up.  Happily I kept hold of the web,\nfor the great elk then turned back, passing between me and the ruck of\nstuff and getting thereby the silk under his chin, and as I came\ngasping to the top once more round came that dainty wreckage over his\nback, and I clutched it, and sooner than it takes to tell I was towing\nto the shore as perhaps no one was ever towed before.\n\nThe big beast dragged the ruck like withered weed behind him, bellowing\nall the time with a voice which made the hills echo all round; and\nthen, when he got his feet upon the shallows, rose dripping and\nmountainous, a very cliff of black hide and limb against the night\nshine, and with a single sweep of his antlers tore the webbing from me,\nwho lay prone and breathless in the mud, and, thinking it was his\nenemy, hurled the limp bundle on the beach, and then, having pounded it\nwith his cloven feet into formless shreds, bellowed again victoriously\nand went off into the darkness of the forests.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nI landed, stiff enough as you will guess, but pleased to be on shore\nagain.  It was a melancholy neighbourhood of low islands, overgrown\nwith rank grass and bushes, salt water encircling them, and inside\nsandy dunes and hummocks with shallow pools, gleaming ghostly in the\nretreating daylight, while beyond these rose the black bosses of what\nlooked like a forest.  Thither I made my way, plunging uncomfortably\nthrough shallows, and tripping over blackened branches which, lying\njust below the surface, quivered like snakes as the evening breeze\nruffled each surface, until the ground hardened under foot, and\npresently I was standing, hungry and faint but safe, on dry land again.\n\nThe forest was so close to the sea, one could not advance without\nentering it, and once within its dark arcades every way looked equally\ngloomy and hopeless.  I struggled through tangles night made more and\nmore impenetrable each minute, until presently I could go no further,\nand where a dense canopy of trees overhead gave out for a minute on the\nedge of a swampy hollow, I determined to wait for daylight.\n\nNever was there a more wet or weary traveller, or one more desperately\nlonely than he who wrapped himself up in the miserable insufficiency of\nhis wet rags, and without fire or supper crept amongst the exposed\nroots of a tree growing out of a bank, and prepared to hope grimly for\nmorning.\n\nRound and round meanwhile was drawn the close screen of night, till the\nclearing in front was blotted out, and only the tree-tops, black as\nrugged hills one behind the other, stood out against the heavy purple\nof the circlet of sky above.  As the evening deepened the quaintest\nnoises began on every hand--noises so strange and bewildering that as I\ncowered down with my teeth chattering, and stared hard into the\nimpenetrable, they could be likened to nothing but the crying of all\nthe souls of dead things since the beginning.  Never was there such an\ninfernal chorus as that which played up the Martian stars.  Down there\nin front, where hummock grass was growing, some beast squeaked\ncontinuously, till I shouted at him, then he stopped a minute, and\nbegan again in entirely another note. Away on the hills two rival\nmonsters were calling to each other in tones so hollow they seemed as I\nlistened to penetrate through me, and echo out of my heart again.  Far\noverhead, gigantic bats were flitting, the shadow of their wings\ndimming a dozen universes at once, and crying to each other in shrill\ntones that rent the air like tearing silk.\n\nAs I listened to those vampires discussing their infernal loves under\nthe stars, from a branch right overhead broke such a deathly howl from\nthe throat of a wandering forest cat that everything else was hushed\nfor a moment.  All about a myriad insects were making night giddy with\ntheir ghostly fires, while underground and from the labyrinths of\nmatted roots came quaint sounds of rustling snakes and forest pigs, and\nall the lesser things that dig and scratch and growl.\n\nYet I was desperately sleepy, my sword hung heavy as lead at my side,\nmy eyelids drooped, and so at last I dozed uneasily for an hour or two.\nThen, all on a sudden, I came wide awake with a shock.  The night was\nquieter now; away in the forest depth strange noises still arose, but\nclose at hand was a strange hush, like the hush of expectation, and,\nlistening wonderingly, I was aware of slow, heavy footsteps coming up\nfrom the river, now two or three steps together, then a pause, then\nanother step or two, and as I bent towards the approaching thing,\nstaring into the darkness, my strained senses were conscious of another\napproach, as like as could be, coming from behind me.  On they came,\nmaking the very ground quake with their weight, till I judged that both\nwere about on the edge of the clearing, two vast rat-like shadows, but\nas big as elephants, and bringing a most intolerable smell of sour\nslime with them. There, on the edge of the amphitheatre, each for the\nfirst time appeared to become aware of the other's presence--the\nfootsteps stopped dead. I could hear the water dripping from the fur of\nthose giant brutes amongst the shadows and the deep breathing of the\none nearest me, a scanty ten paces off, but not another sound in the\nstillness.\n\nMinute after minute passed, yet neither moved.  A half-hour grew to a\nfull hour, and that hour lengthened amid the keenest tension till my\nears ached with listening, and my eyes were sore with straining into\nthe blackness.  At last I began to wonder whether those earth-shaking\nbeasts had not been an evil dream, and was just venturing to stretch\nout a cramped leg, and rally myself upon my cowardice, when, without\nwarning, at my elbow rose the most ear-piercing scream of rage that\never came from a living throat.  There was a sweeping rush in the\ndarkness which I could feel but not see, and with a shock the two\ngladiators met in the midst of the arena.  Over and over they went\nscreaming and struggling, and slipping and plunging.  I could hear them\ntearing at each other, and the sharp cries of pain, first one and then\nanother gave as claw or tooth got home, and all the time, though the\nground was quaking under their struggles and the air full of horrible\nuproar, not a thing was to be seen.  I did not even know what manner of\nbeasts they were who rocked and rolled and tore at each other's\nthroats, but I heard their teeth snapping, and their fierce breath in\nthe pauses of the struggle, and could but wait in a huddle amongst the\nroots until it was over. To and fro they went, now at the far side of\nthe dark clearing, now so close that hot drops of blood from their jaws\nfell on my face like rain in the darkness.  It seemed as though the\nfight would never end, but presently there was more of worrying in it\nand less of snapping; it was clear one or the other had had enough and\nas I marked this those black shadows came gasping and struggling\ntowards me.  There was a sudden sharp cry, a desperate final\ntussle--before which strong trees snapped and bushes were flattened out\nlike grass, not twenty yards away--and then for a minute all was silent.\n\nOne of them had killed, and as I sat rooted to the spot I was forced to\nlisten while his enemy tore him up and ate him.  Many a banquet have I\nbeen at, but never an uglier one than that.  I sat in the darkness\nwhile the unknown thing at my feet ripped the flesh from his half-dead\nrival in strips, and across the damp night wind came the reek of that\nabominable feast--the reek of blood and spilt entrails--until I turned\naway my face in loathing, and was nearly starting to my feet to venture\na rush into the forest shadows.  But I was spellbound, and remained\nlistening to the heavy munch of blood-stained jaws until presently I\nwas aware other and lesser feasters were coming.  There was a twinkle\nof hungry eyes all about the limits of the area, the shine of green\npoints of envious fire that circled round in decreasing orbits, as the\nlittle foxes and jackals came crowding in.  One fellow took me for a\nrock, so still I sat, putting his hot, soft paws upon my knee for a\nspace, and others passed me so near I could all but touch them.\n\nThe big beast had taken himself off by this time, and there must have\nbeen several hundreds of these newcomers.  A merry time they had of it;\nthe whole place was full of the green, hurrying eyes, and amidst the\nsnap of teeth and yapping and quarrelling I could hear the flesh being\ntorn from the red bones in every direction.  One wolf-like individual\nbrought a mass of hot liver to eat between my feet, but I gave him a\nkick, and sent him away much to his surprise.  Gradually, however, the\nsound of this unholy feast died away, and, though you may hardly\nbelieve it, I fell off into a doze.  It was not sleep, but it served\nthe purpose, and when in an hour or two a draught of cool air roused\nme, I awoke, feeling more myself again.\n\nSlowly morning came, and the black wall of forest around became full of\npurple interstices as the east brightened.  Those glimmers of light\nbetween bough and trunk turned to yellow and red, the day-shine\npresently stretched like a canopy from point to point of the treetops\non either side of my sleeping-place, and I arose.\n\nAll my limbs were stiff with cold, my veins emptied by hunger and\nwounds, and for a space I had not even strength to move.  But a little\nrubbing softened my cramped muscles presently and limping painfully\ndown to the place of combat, I surveyed the traces of that midnight\nfight.  I will not dwell upon it.  It was ugly and grim; the trampled\ngrass, the giant footmarks, each enringing its pool of curdled blood;\nthe broken bushes, the grooved mud-slides where the unknown brutes had\nslid in deadly embrace; the hollows, the splintered boughs, their\nragged points tufted with skin and hair--all was sickening to me.  Yet\nso hungry was I that when I turned towards the odious remnants of the\nvanquished--a shapeless mass of abomination--my thoughts flew at once\nto breakfasting!  I went down and inspected the victim cautiously--a\nhuge rat-like beast as far as might be judged from the bare uprising\nribs--all that was left of him looking like the framework of a schooner\nyacht.  His heart lay amongst the offal, and my knife came out to cut a\nmeal from it, but I could not do it.  Three times I essayed the task,\nhunger and disgust contending for mastery; three times turned back in\nloathing.  At last I could stand the sight no more, and, slamming the\nknife up again, turned on my heels, and fairly ran for fresh air and\nthe shore, where the sea was beginning to glimmer in the light a few\nscore yards through the forest stems.  There, once more out on the\nopen, on a pebbly beach, I stripped, spreading my things out to dry on\nthe stones, and laying myself down with the lapping of the waves in my\nears, and the first yellow sunshine thawing my limbs, tried to piece\ntogether the hurrying events of the last few days.\n\nWhat were my gay Martians doing?  Lazy dogs to let me, a stranger, be\nthe only one to draw sword in defence of their own princess!  Where was\npoor Heru, that sweet maiden wife?  The thought of her in the hands of\nthe ape-men was odious.  And yet was I not mad to try to rescue, or\neven to follow her alone?  If by any chance I could get off this\nbeast-haunted place and catch up with the ravishers, what had I to look\nfor from them except speedy extinction, and that likely enough by the\nmost painful process they were acquainted with?\n\nThe other alternative of going back empty handed was terribly\nignominious. I had lectured the amiable young manhood of Seth so\nsoundly on the subject of gallantry, and set them such a good example\non two occasions, that it would be bathos to saunter back, hands in\npockets, and confess I knew nothing of the lady's fate and had been\ndaunted by the first night alone in the forest.  Besides, how dull it\nwould be in that beautiful, tumble-down old city without Heru, with no\nexpectation day by day of seeing her sylph-like form and hearing the\nmerry tinkle of her fairy laughter as she scoffed at the unknown\nlearning collected by her ancestors in a thousand laborious years.  No!\nI would go on for certain.  I was young, in love, and angry, and before\nthose qualifications difficulties became light.\n\nMeanwhile, the first essential was breakfast of some kind.  I arose,\nstretched, put on my half-dried clothes, and mounting a low hummock on\nthe forest edge looked around.  The sun was riding up finely into the\nsky, and the sea to the eastward shone for leagues and leagues in the\nloveliest azure.  Where it rippled on my own beach and those of the low\nislands noted over night, a wonderful fire of blue and red played on\nthe sands as though the broken water were full of living gems.  The sky\nwas full of strange gulls with long, forked tails, and a lovely little\nflying lizard with transparent wings of the palest green--like those of\na grasshopper--was flitting about picking up insect stragglers.\n\nAll this was very charming, but what I kept saying to myself was\n\"Streaky rashers and hot coffee: rashers and coffee and rolls,\" and,\nindeed, had the gates of Paradise themselves opened at that moment I\nfear my first look down the celestial streets within would have been\nfor a restaurant. They did not, and I was just turning away\ndisconsolate when my eye caught, ascending from behind the next bluff\ndown the beach, a thin strand of smoke rising into the morning air.\n\nIt was nothing so much in itself--a thin spiral creeping upwards\nmast-high, then flattening out into a mushroom head--but it meant\neverything to me.  Where there was fire there must be humanity, and\nwhere there was humanity--ay, to the very outlayers of the\nuniverse--there must be breakfast.  It was a splendid thought; I rushed\ndown the hillock and went gaily for that blue thread amongst the reeds.\nIt was not two hundred yards away, and soon below me was a tiny bay\nwith bluest water frilling a silver beach, and in the midst of it a\nfire on a hearth dancing round a pot that simmered gloriously.  But of\nan owner there was nothing to be seen.  I peered here and there on the\nshore, but nothing moved, while out to sea the water was shining like\nmolten metal with not a dot upon it!--what did it matter?  I laughed\nas, pleased and hungry, I slipped down the bank and strode across the\nsands; it pleased Fate to play bandy with me, and if it sent me\nsupperless to bed, why, here was restitution in the way of breakfast.\nI took up a morsel of the stuff in the kettle on a handy stick and\nfound it good--indeed, I knew it at once as a very dainty mess made\nfrom the roots of a herb the Martians greatly liked; An had piled my\nplatter with it when we supped that night in the market-place of Seth,\nand the sweet white stuff had melted into my corporal essence, it\nseemed, without any gross intermediate process of digestion.  And here\nI was again, hungry, sniffing the fragrant breath of a full meal and\nnot a soul in sight--I should have been a fool not to have eaten.  So\nthinking, down I sat, taking the pot from its place, and when it was a\nlittle cool plunging my hands into it and feasting with as good an\nappetite as ever a man had before.\n\nIt was gloriously ambrosial, and deeper and deeper I went, with the\ntall stalk of the smoke in front growing from the hearth-stones like\nsome strange new plant, the pleasant sunshine on my back, and never a\nthought for anything but the task in hand.  Deeper and deeper,\noblivious of all else, until to get the very last drops I lifted the\npipkin up and putting back my head drank in that fashion.\n\nIt was only when with a sigh of pleasure I lowered it slowly again that\nover the rim as it sank there dawned upon me the vision of a Martian\nstanding by an empty canoe on the edge of the water and regarding me\nwith calm amazement.  I was, in fact, so astonished that for a minute\nthe empty pot stood still before my face, and over its edge we stared\nat each other in mute surprise, then with all the dignity that might be\nI laid the vessel down between my feet and waited for the newcomer to\nspeak.  She was a girl by her yellow garb, a fisherwoman, it seemed,\nfor in the prow of her craft was piled a net upon which the scales of\nfishes were twinkling--a Martian, obviously, but something more robust\nthan most of them, a savour of honest work about her sunburnt face\nwhich my pallid friends away yonder were lacking in, and when we had\nstared at each other for a few moments in silence she came forward a\nstep or two and said without a trace of fear or shyness, \"Are you a\nspirit, sir?\n\n\"Why,\" I answered, \"about as much, no more and no less, than most of\nus.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" she said.  \"I thought you were, for none but spirits live here\nupon this island; are you for good or evil?\"\n\n\"Far better for the breakfast of which I fear I have robbed you, but\nwandering along the shore and finding this pot boiling with no owner, I\nventured to sample it, and it was so good my appetite got the better of\nmanners.\"\n\nThe girl bowed, and standing at a respectful distance asked if I would\nlike some fish as well; she had some, but not many, and if I would eat\nshe would cook them for me in a minute--it was not often, she added\nlightly, she had met one of my kind before.  In fact, it was obvious\nthat simple person did actually take me for a being of another world,\nand was it for me to say she was wrong?  So adopting a dignity worthy\nof my reputation I nodded gravely to her offer.  She fetched from the\nboat four little fishes of the daintiest kind imaginable.  They were\neach about as big as a hand and pale blue when you looked down upon\nthem, but so clear against the light that every bone and vein in their\nbodies could be traced.  These were wrapped just as they were in a\nbroad, green leaf and then the Martian, taking a pointed stick, made a\nhollow in the white ashes, laid them in side by side, and drew the hot\ndust over again.\n\nWhile they cooked we chatted as though the acquaintance were the most\ncasual thing in the world, and I found it was indeed an island we were\non and not the mainland, as I had hoped at first.  Seth, she told me,\nwas far away to the eastward, and if the woodmen had gone by in their\nships they would have passed round to the north-west of where we were.\n\nI spent an hour or two with that amiable individual, and, it is to be\nhoped, sustained the character of a spiritual visitant with\nconsiderable dignity.  In one particular at least, that, namely, of\nappetite, I did honour to my supposed source, and as my entertainer\nwould not hear of payment in material kind, all I could do was to show\nher some conjuring tricks, which greatly increased her belief in my\nsupernatural origin, and to teach her some new hitches and knots, using\nher fishing-line as a means of illustration, a demonstration which\ncalled from her the natural observation that we must be good sailors\n\"up aloft\" since we knew so much about cordage, then we parted.\n\nShe had seen nothing of the woodmen, though she had heard they had been\nto Seth and thought, from some niceties of geographical calculation\nwhich I could not follow, they would have crossed to the north, as just\nstated, of her island.  There she told me, with much surprise at my\ndesire for the information, how I might, by following the forest track\nto the westward coast, make my way to a fishing village, where they\nwould give me a canoe and direct me, since such was my extraordinary\nwish, to the place where, if anywhere, the wild men had touched on\ntheir way home.\n\nShe filled my wallet with dried honey-cakes and my mouth with sugar\nplums from her little store, then down on her knees went that poor waif\nof a worn-out civilisation and kissed my hands in humble farewell, and\nI, blushing to be so saluted, and after all but a sailor, got her by\nthe rosy fingers and lifted her up shoulder high, and getting one hand\nunder her chin and the other behind her head kissed her twice upon her\npretty cheeks; and so, I say, we parted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOff into the forest I went, feeling a boyish elation to be so free nor\ntaking heed or count of the reckless adventure before me.  The Martian\nweather for the moment was lovely and the many-coloured grass lush and\nsoft under foot.  Mile after mile I went, heeding the distance lightly,\nthe air was so elastic.  Now pressing forward as the main interest of\nmy errand took the upper hand, and remembrance of poor Heru like a\ncrushed white flower in the red grip of those cruel ravishers came upon\nme, and then pausing to sigh with pleasure or stand agape--forgetful\neven of her--in wonder of the unknown loveliness about me.\n\nAnd well might I stare!  Everything in that forest was wonderful!\nThere were plants which turned from colour to colour with the varying\nhours of the day.  While others had a growth so swift it was dangerous\nto sit in their neighbourhood since the long, succulent tendrils\nclambering from the parent stem would weave you into a helpless tangle\nwhile you gazed, fascinated, upon them.  There were plants that climbed\nand walked; sighing plants who called the winged things of the air to\nthem with a noise so like to a girl sobbing that again and again I\nstopped in the tangled path to listen.  There were green bladder-mosses\nwhich swam about the surface of the still pools like gigantic\nfrog-broods.  There were on the ridges warrior trees burning in the\nvindictiveness of a long forgotten cause--a blaze of crimson scimitar\nthorns from root to topmost twig; and down again in the cool hollows\nwere lady-bushes making twilight of the green gloom with their cloudy\nivory blossoms and filling the shadows with such a heavy scent that\nhead and heart reeled with fatal pleasure as one pushed aside their\nbranches.  Every river-bed was full of mighty reeds, whose stems\nclattered together when the wind blew like swords on shields, and every\nnow and then a bit of forest was woven together with the ropey stems of\ngiant creepers till no man or beast could have passed save for the\npaths which constant use had kept open through the mazes.\n\nAll day long I wandered on through those wonderful woodlands, and in\nfact loitered so much over their infinite marvels that when sundown\ncame all too soon there was still undulating forest everywhere, vistas\nof fairy glades on every hand, peopled with incredible things and\nechoing with sounds that excited the ears as much as other things\nfascinated the eyes, but no sign of the sea or my fishing village\nanywhere.\n\nIt did not matter; a little of the Martian leisureliness was getting\ninto my blood: \"If not today, why then tomorrow,\" as An would have\nsaid; and with this for comfort I selected a warm, sandy hollow under\nthe roots of a big tree, made my brief arrangements for the night, ate\nsome honey cakes, and was soon sleeping blissfully.\n\nI woke early next morning, after many hours of interrupted dreams, and\nhaving nothing to do till the white haze had lifted and made it\npossible to start again, rested idly a time on my elbow and watched the\nsunshine filter into the recesses.\n\nVery pretty it was to see the thick canopy overhead, by star-light so\nimpenetrable, open its chinks and fissures as the searching sun came\nupon it; to see the pin-hole gaps shine like spangles presently, the\nspaces broaden into lesser suns, and even the thick leafage brighten\nand shine down on me with a soft sea-green radiance.  The sunward sides\nof the tree-stems took a glow, and the dew that ran dripping down their\nmossy sides trickled blood-red to earth.  Elsewhere the shadows were\nstill black, and strange things began to move in them--things we in our\nmiddle-aged world have never seen the likeness of: beasts half birds,\nbirds half creeping things, and creeping things which it seemed to me\npassed through lesser creations down to the basest life that crawls\nwithout interruption or division.\n\nIt was not for me, a sailor, to know much of such things, yet some I\ncould not fail to notice.  On one grey branch overhead, jutting from a\ntree-stem where a patch of velvet moss made in the morning glint a\nfairy bed, a wonderful flower unfolded.  It was a splendid bud, ivory\nwhite, cushioned in leaves, and secured to its place by naked white\nroots that clipped the branch like fingers of a lady's hand.  Even as I\nlooked it opened, a pale white star, and hung pensive and inviting on\nits mossy cushion.  From it came such a ravishing odour that even I, at\nthe further end of the great scale of life, felt my pulses quicken and\nmy eyes brighten with cupidity.  I was in the very act of climbing the\ntree, but before I could move hand or foot two things happened, whether\nyou take my word for them or no.\n\nFirstly, up through a glade in the underwood, attracted by the odour,\ncame an ugly brown bird with a capacious beak and shining claws.  He\nperched near by, and peeped and peered until he made out the flower\npining on her virgin stem, whereat off he hopped to her branch and\nthere, with a cynical chuckle, strutted to and fro between her and the\nmain stem like an ill genius guarding a fairy princess.\n\nSurely Heaven would not allow him to tamper with so chaste a bud! My\nhand reached for a stone to throw at him when happened the second\nthing.  There came a gentle pat upon the woodland floor, and from a\ntree overhead dropped down another living plant like to the one above\nyet not exactly similar, a male, my instincts told me, in full solitary\nblossom like her above, cinctured with leaves, and supported by half a\nscore of thick white roots that worked, as I looked, like the limbs of\na crab.  In a twinkling that parti-coloured gentleman vegetable near me\nwas off to the stem upon which grew his lady love; running and\nscrambling, dragging the finery of his tasselled petals behind, it was\nlaughable to watch his eagerness.  He got a grip of the tree and up he\nwent, \"hand over hand,\" root over root.  I had just time to note others\nof his species had dropped here and there upon the ground, and were\nhurrying with frantic haste to the same destination when he reached the\nfatal branch, and was straddling victoriously down it, blind to all but\nlove and longing.  That ill-omened bird who stood above the\nmaiden-flower let him come within a stalk's length, so near that the\nwhite splendour of his sleeping lady gleamed within arms' reach, then\nthe great beak was opened, the great claws made a clutch, the gallant's\nhead was yanked from his neck, and as it went tumbling down the maw of\nthe feathered thing his white legs fell spinning through space, and lay\nknotting themselves in agony upon the ground for a minute or two before\nthey relaxed and became flaccid in the repose of death. Another and\nanother vegetable suitor made for that fatal tryst, and as each came up\nthe snap of the brown bird's beak was all their obsequies. At last no\nmore came, and then that Nemesis of claws and quills walked over to the\ngirl-flower, his stomach feathers ruffled with repletion, the green\nblood of her lovers dripping from his claws, and pulled her golden\nheart out, tore her white limbs one from the other, and swallowed her\npiecemeal before my very eyes!  Then up in wrath I jumped and yelled at\nhim till the woods echoed, but too late to stay his sacrilege.\n\nBy this time the sun was bathing everything in splendour, and turning\naway from the wonders about me, I set off at best pace along the\nwell-trodden path which led without turning to the west coast village\nwhere the canoes were.\n\nIt proved far closer than expected.  As a matter of fact the forest in\nthis direction grew right down to the water's edge; the salt-loving\ntrees actually overhanging the waves--one of the pleasantest sights in\nnature--and thus I came right out on top of the hamlet before there had\nbeen an indication of its presence.  It occupied two sides of a pretty\nlittle bay, the third side being flat land given over to the\ncultivation of an enormous species of gourd whose characteristic yellow\nflowers and green, succulent leaves were discernible even at this\ndistance.\n\nI branched off along the edge of the surf and down a dainty little\nflowery path, noticing meanwhile how the whole bay was filled by\nhundreds of empty canoes, while scores of others were drawn up on the\nstrand, and then the first thing I chanced upon was a group of\npeople--youthful, of course, with the eternal Martian bloom--and in the\nsplendid simplicity of almost complete nakedness.  My first idea was\nthat they were bathing, and fixing my eyes on the tree-tops with great\npropriety, I gave a warning cough. At that sound instead of getting to\ncover, or clothes, all started up and stood staring for a time like a\nherd of startled cattle.  It was highly embarrassing; they were right\nin the path, a round dozen of them, naked and so little ashamed that\nwhen I edged away modestly they began to run after me.  And the farther\nthey came forward the more I retired, till we were playing a kind of\ngame of hide-and-seek round the tree-stems. In the middle of it my heel\ncaught in a root and down I went very hard and very ignominiously,\nwhereon those laughing, light-hearted folk rushed in, and with smiles\nand jests helped me to my feet.\n\n\"Was I the traveller who had come from Seth?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, then that was well.  They had heard such a traveller was on the\nroad, and had come a little way down the path, as far as might be\nwithout fatigue, to meet him.\"\n\n\"Would I eat with them?\" these amiable strangers asked, pushing their\nsoft warm fingers into mine and ringing me round with a circle.  \"But\nfirstly might they help me out of my clothes?  It was hot, and these\nthings were cumbersome.\"  As to the eating, I was agreeable enough\nseeing how casual meals had been with me lately, but my clothes, though\nHeaven knows they were getting horribly ragged and travel-stained, I\nclung to desperately.\n\nMy new friends shrugged their dimpled shoulders and, arguments being\ntedious, at once squatted round me in the dappled shade of a big tree\nand produced their stores of never failing provisions.  After a\npleasant little meal taken thus in the open and with all the simplicity\nMartians delight in, we got to talking about those yellow canoes which\nwere bobbing about on the blue waters of the bay.\n\n\"Would you like to see where they are grown?\" asked an individual\nbasking by my side.\n\n\"Grown!\" I answered with incredulity.  \"Built, you mean.  Never in my\nlife did I hear of growing boats.\"\n\n\"But then, sir,\" observed the girl as she sucked the honey out of the\nstalk of an azure convolvulus flower and threw the remains at a\nbutterfly that sailed across the sunshine, \"you know so little!  You\nhave come from afar, from some barbarous and barren district.  Here we\nundoubtedly grow our boats, and though we know the Thither folk and\nsuch uncultivated races make their craft by cumbrous methods of flat\nplanks, yet we prefer our own way, for one thing because it saves\ntrouble,\" and as she murmured that all-sufficient reason the gentle\ndamsel nodded reflectively.\n\nBut one of her companions, more lively for the moment, tickled her with\na straw until she roused, and then said, \"Let us take the stranger to\nthe boat garden now.  The current will drift us round the bay, and we\ncan come back when it turns.  If we wait we shall have to row in both\ndirections, or even walk,\" and again planetary slothfulness carried the\nday.\n\nSo down to the beach we strolled and launched one of the golden-hued\nskiffs upon the pretty dancing wavelets just where they ran, lipped\nwith jewelled spray, on the shore, and then only had I a chance to\nscrutinise their material.  I patted that one we were upon inside and\nout.  I noted with a seaman's admiration its lightness, elasticity, and\nsupreme sleekness, its marvellous buoyancy and fairy-like \"lines,\" and\nafter some minutes' consideration it suddenly flashed across me that it\nwas all of gourd rind.  And as if to supply confirmation, the flat land\nwe were approaching on the opposite side of the bay was covered by the\ncharacteristic verdure of these plants with a touch here and there of\nsplendid yellow blossoms, but all of gigantic proportions.\n\n\"Ay,\" said a Martian damsel lying on the bottom, and taking and kissing\nmy hand as she spoke, in the simple-hearted way of her people, \"I see\nyou have guessed how we make our boats.  Is it the same in your distant\ncountry?\"\n\n\"No, my girl, and what's more, I am a bit uneasy as to what the fellows\non the Carolina will say if they ever hear I went to sea in a\nhollowed-out pumpkin, and with a young lady--well, dressed as you\nare--for crew.  Even now I cannot imagine how you get your ships so\ntrim and shapely--there is not a seam or a patch anywhere, it looks as\nif you had run them into a mould.\"\n\n\"That's just what we have done, sir, and now you will witness the\nmoulds at work, for here we are,\" and the little skiff was pulled\nashore and the Martians and I jumped out on the shelving beach, hauled\nour boat up high and dry, and there right over us, like great green\numbrellas, spread the fronds of the outmost garden of this strangest of\nall ship-building yards. Briefly, and not to make this part of my story\ntoo long, those gilded boys and girls took me ashore, and chattering\nlike finches in the evening, showed how they planted their gourd seed,\nnourished the gigantic plants as they grew with brackish water and the\nburnt ashes; then, when they flowered, mated the male and female\nblossoms, glorious funnels of golden hue big enough for one to live in;\nand when the young fruit was of the bigness of an ordinary bolster, how\nthey slipped it into a double mould of open reed-work something like\nthe two halves of a walnut-shell; and how, growing day by day in this,\nit soon took every curve and line they chose to give it, even the\nhanging keel below, the strengthened bulwarks, and tall prow-piece.  It\nwas so ingenious, yet simple; and I confess I laughed over my first\nskiff \"on the stalk,\" and fell to bantering the Martians, asking\nwhether it was a good season for navies, whether their Cunarders were\nspreading nicely, if they could give me a pinch of barge seed, or a\nyacht in bud to show to my friends at home.\n\nBut those lazy people took the matter seriously enough.  They led me\ndown green alleys arched over with huge melon-like leaves; they led me\nalong innumerable byways, making me peep and peer through the chequered\nsunlight at ocean-growing craft, that had budded twelve months before,\nalready filling their moulds to the last inch of space.  They told me\nthat when the growing process was sufficiently advanced, they loosened\nthe casing, and cutting a hole into the interior of each giant fruit,\nscooped out all its seed, thereby checking more advance, and throwing\ninto the rind strength that would otherwise have gone to\nreproductiveness. They said each fruit made two vessels, but the upper\nhalf was always best and used for long salt-water journeys, the lower\npiece being but for punting or fishing on their lakes.  They cut them\nin half while still green, scraped out the light remaining pulp when\ndry, and dragged them down with the minimum of trouble, light as\nfeathers, tenacious as steel plate, and already in the form and fashion\nof dainty craft from five to twenty feet in length, when the process\nwas completed.\n\nBy the time we had explored this strangest of ship-building yards, and\nI had seen last year's crop on the stocks being polished and fitted\nwith seats and gear, the sun was going down; and the Martian twilight,\nowing to the comparative steepness of the little planet's sides, being\nbrief, we strolled back to the village, and there they gave me\nharbourage for the night, ambrosial supper, and a deep draught of the\nwine of Forgetfulness, under the gauzy spell of which the real and\nunreal melted into the vistas of rosy oblivion, and I slept.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nWith the new morning came fresh energy and a spasm of conscience as I\nthought of poor Heru and the shabby sort of rescuer I was to lie about\nwith these pretty triflers while she remained in peril.\n\nSo I had a bath and a swim, a breakfast, and, to my shame be it\nacknowledged, a sort of farewell merry-go-round dance on the yellow\nsands with a dozen young persons all light-hearted as the morning,\nbeautiful as the flowers that bound their hair, and in the extremity of\nstatuesque attire.\n\nThen at last I got them to give me a sea-going canoe, a stock of cakes\nand fresh water; and with many parting injunctions how to find the\nWoodman trail, since I would not listen to reason and lie all the rest\nof my life with them in the sunshine, they pushed me off on my lonely\nvoyage.\n\n\"Over the blue waters!\" they shouted in chorus as I dipped my paddle\ninto the diamond-crested wavelets.  \"Six hours, adventurous stranger,\nwith the sun behind you!  Then into the broad river behind the yellow\nsand-bar. But not the black northward river!  Not the strong, black\nriver, above all things, stranger!  For that is the River of the Dead,\nby which many go but none come back.  Goodbye!\"  And waving them adieu,\nI sternly turned my eyes from delights behind and faced the fascination\nof perils in front.\n\nIn four hours (for the Martians had forgotten in their calculations\nthat my muscles were something better than theirs) I \"rose\" the further\nshore, and then the question was, Where ran that westward river of\ntheirs?\n\nIt turned out afterwards that, knowing nothing of their tides, I had\ndrifted much too far to northward, and consequently the coast had\nclosed up the estuary mouth I should have entered.  Not a sign of an\nopening showed anywhere, and having nothing whatever for guidance I\nturned northward, eagerly scanning an endless line of low cliffs, as\nthe day lessened, for the promised sand-bar or inlet.\n\nAbout dusk my canoe, flying swiftly forward at its own sweet will,\nbrought me into a bight, a bare, desolate-looking country with no\nvegetation save grass and sedge on the near marshes and stony hills\nrising up beyond, with others beyond them mounting step by step to a\nlong line of ridges and peaks still covered in winter snow.\n\nThe outlook was anything but cheering.  Not a trace of habitation had\nbeen seen for a long time, not a single living being in whose\nneighbourhood I could land and ask the way; nothing living anywhere but\na monstrous kind of sea-slug, as big as a dog, battening on the\nwaterside garbage, and gaunt birds like vultures who croaked on the\nmud-flats, and half-spread wings of funereal blackness as they\ngambolled here and there.  Where was poor Heru?  Where pink-shouldered\nAn?  Where those wild men who had taken the princess from us?  Lastly,\nbut not least, where was I?\n\nAll the first stars of the Martian sky were strange to me, and my boat\nwhirling round and round on the current confused what little geography\nI might otherwise have retained.  It was a cheerless look out, and\nagain and again I cursed my folly for coming on such a fool's errand as\nI sat, chin in hand, staring at a landscape that grew more and more\ndepressing every mile.  To go on looked like destruction, to go back\nwas almost impossible without a guide; and while I was still wondering\nwhich of the two might be the lesser evil, the stream I was on turned a\ncorner, and in a moment we were upon water which ran with swift, oily\nsmoothness straight for the snow-ranges now beginning to loom\nunpleasantly close ahead.\n\nBy this time the night was coming on apace, the last of the\nevil-looking birds had winged its way across the red sunset glare, and\nthough it was clear enough in mid-river under the banks, now steep and\nunclimbable, it was already evening.\n\nAnd with the darkness came a wondrous cold breath from off the\nice-fields, blowing through my lowland wrappings as though they were\nbut tissue. I munched a bit of honey-cake, took a cautious sip of wine,\nand though I will not own I was frightened, yet no one will deny that\nthe circumstances were discouraging.\n\nStanding up in the frail canoe and looking around, at the second glance\nan object caught my eye coming with the stream, and rapidly overtaking\nme on a strong sluice of water.  It was a raft of some sort, and\nsomething extra-ordinarily like a sitting Martian on it!  Nearer and\nnearer it came, bobbing to the rise and fall of each wavelet with the\nlast icy sunlight touching it up with reds and golds, nearer and nearer\nin the deadly hush of that forsaken region, and then at last so near it\nshowed quite plainly on the purple water, a raft with some one sitting\nunder a canopy.\n\nWith a thrill of delight I waved my cap aloft and shouted--\n\n\"Ship-ahoy!  Hullo, messmate, where are we bound to?\"\n\nBut never an answer came from that swiftly-passing stranger, so again I\nhailed--\n\n\"Put up your helm, Mr. Skipper; I have lost my bearings, and the\nchronometer has run down,\" but without a pause or sound that strange\ncraft went slipping by.\n\nThat silence was more than I could stand.  It was against all sea\ncourtesies, and the last chance of learning where I was passing away.\nSo, angrily the paddle was snatched from the canoe bottom, and roaring\nout again--\n\n\"Stop, I say, you d---- lubber, stop, or by all the gods I will make\nyou!\"  I plunged the paddle into the water and shot my little craft\nslantingly across the stream to intercept the newcomer.  A single\nstroke sent me into mid-stream, a second brought me within touch of\nthat strange craft.  It was a flat raft, undoubtedly, though so\ndisguised by flowers and silk trailers that its shape was difficult to\nmake out. In the centre was a chair of ceremony bedecked with greenery\nand great pale buds, hardly yet withered--oh, where had I seen such a\nchair and such a raft before?\n\nAnd the riddle did not long remain unanswered.  Upon that seat, as I\nswept up alongside and laid a sunburnt hand upon its edge, was a girl,\nand another look told me she was dead!\n\nSuch a sweet, pallid, Martian maid, her fair head lolling back against\nthe rear of the chair and gently moving to and fro with the rise and\nfall of her craft.  Her face in the pale light of the evening like\ncarved ivory, and not less passionless and still; her arms bare, and\nher poor fingers still closed in her lap upon the beautiful buds they\nhad put into them. I fairly gasped with amazement at the dreadful\nsweetness of that solitary lady, and could hardly believe she was\nreally a corpse!  But, alas! there was no doubt of it, and I stared at\nher, half in admiration and half in fear; noting how the last sunset\nflush lent a hectic beauty to her face for a moment, and then how fair\nand ghostly she stood out against the purpling sky; how her light\ndrapery lifted to the icy wind, and how dreadfully strange all those\nsoft-scented flowers and trappings seemed as we sped along side by side\ninto the country of night and snow.\n\nThen all of a sudden the true meaning of her being there burst upon me,\nand with a start and a cry I looked around.  WE WERE FLYING SWIFTLY\nDOWN THAT RIVER OF THE DEAD THEY HAD TOLD ME OF THAT HAS NO OUTLET AND\nNO RETURNING!\n\nWith frantic haste I snatched up a paddle again and tried to paddle\nagainst the great black current sweeping us forward.  I worked until\nthe perspiration stood in beads on my forehead, and all the time I\nworked the river, like some black snake, hissed and twined, and that\npretty lady rode cheerily along at my side.  Overhead stars of\nunearthly brilliancy were coming out in the frosty sky, while on either\nhand the banks were high and the shadows under them black as ink.  In\nthose shadows now and then I noticed with a horrible indifference other\nrafts were travelling, and presently, as the stream narrowed, they came\nout and joined us, dead Martians, budding boys and girls; older\nvoyagers with their age quickening upon them in the Martian manner,\njust as some fruit only ripens after it falls; yellow-girt slaves\nstaring into the night in front, quite a merry crew all clustered about\nI and that gentle lady, and more far ahead and more behind, all bobbing\nand jostling forward as we hurried to the dreadful graveyard in the\nMartian regions of eternal winter none had ever seen and no one came\nto!  I cried aloud in my desolation and fear and hid my face in my\nhands, while the icy cliffs mocked my cry and the dead maid, tripping\nalongside, rolled her head over, and stared at me with stony, unseeing\neyes.\n\nWell, I am no fine writer.  I sat down to tell a plain, unvarnished\ntale, and I will not let the weird horror of that ride get into my pen.\nWe careened forward, I and those lost Martians, until pretty near on\nmidnight, by which time the great light-giving planets were up, and\nnever a chance did Fate give me all that time of parting company with\nthem. About midnight we were right into the region of snow and ice, not\nthe actual polar region of the planet, as I afterwards guessed, but one\nof those long outliers which follow the course of the broad waterways\nalmost into fertile regions, and the cold, though intense, was somewhat\nmodified by the complete stillness of the air.\n\nIt was just then that I began to be aware of a low, rumbling sound\nahead, increasing steadily until there could not be any doubt the\njourney was nearly over and we were approaching those great falls An\nhad told me of, over which the dead tumble to perpetual oblivion.\nThere was no opportunity for action, and, luckily, little time for\nthought. I remember clapping my hand to my heart as I muttered an\nimperfect prayer, and laughing a little as I felt in my pocket, between\nit and that organ, an envelope containing some corn-plaster and a\npacket of unpaid tailors' bills.  Then I pulled out that locket with\npoor forgotten Polly's photograph, and while I was still kissing it\nfervently, and the dead girl on my right was jealously nudging my canoe\nwith the corner of her raft, we plunged into a narrow gully as black as\nhell, shot round a sharp corner at a tremendous pace, and the moment\nafterwards entered a lake in the midst of an unbroken amphitheatre of\ncliffs gleaming in soft light all round.\n\nEven to this moment I can recall the blue shine of those terrible ice\ncrags framing the weird picture in on every hand, and the strange\neffect upon my mind as we passed out of the darkness of the gully down\nwhich we had come into the sepulchral radiance of that place.  But\nthough it fixed with one instantaneous flash its impression on my mind\nforever, there was no time to admire it.  As we swept on to the lake's\nsurface, and a glance of light coming over a dip in the ice walls to\nthe left lit up the dead faces and half-withered flowers of my\nfellow-travellers with startling distinctness, I noticed with a new\nterror at the lower end of the lake towards which we were hurrying the\nwater suddenly disappeared in a cloud of frosty spray, and it was from\nthence came the low, ominous rumble which had sounded up the ravine as\nwe approached.  It was the fall, and beyond the stream dropped down\nglassy step after step, in wild pools and rapids, through which no boat\ncould live for a moment, to a black cavern entrance, where it was\nswallowed up in eternal night.\n\nI WOULD not go that way!  With a yell such as those solitudes had\nprobably never heard since the planet was fashioned out of the void, I\nseized the paddle again and struck out furiously from the main current,\nwith the result of postponing the crisis for a time, and finding myself\nbobbing round towards the northern amphitheatre, where the light fell\nclearest from planets overhead.  It was like a great ballroom with\nthose constellations for tapers, and a ghastly crowd of Martians were\ndoing cotillions and waltzes all about me on their rafts as the\ntroubled water, icy cold and clear as glass, eddied us here and there\nin solemn confusion.  On the narrow beaches at the cliff foot were\nhundreds of wrecked voyagers--the wall-flowers of that ghostly\nassembly-room--and I went jostling and twirling round the circle as\nthough looking for a likely partner, until my brain spun and my heart\nwas sick.\n\nFor twenty minutes Fate played with me, and then the deadly suck of the\nstream got me down again close to where the water began to race for the\nfalls.  I vowed savagely I would not go over them if it could be\nhelped, and struggled furiously.\n\nOn the left, in shadow, a narrow beach seemed to lie between the water\nand the cliff foot; towards it I fought.  At the very first stroke I\nfouled a raft; the occupant thereof came tumbling aboard and nearly\nswamped me. But now it was a fight for life, so him I seized without\nceremony by clammy neck and leg and threw back into the water.  Then\nanother playful Martian butted the behind part of my canoe and set it\nspinning, so that all the stars seemed to be dancing giddily in the\nsky.  With a yell I shoved him off, but only to find his comrades were\nclosing round me in a solid ring as we sucked down to the abyss at\never-increasing speed.\n\nThen I fought like a fury, hacking, pushing, and paddling shorewards,\ncrying out in my excitement, and spinning and bumping and twisting ever\ndownwards.  For every foot I gained they pushed me on a yard, as though\ndetermined their fate should be mine also.\n\nThey crowded round me in a compact circle, their poor flower-girt heads\nnodding as the swift current curtsied their crafts.  They hemmed me in\nwith desperate persistency as we spun through the ghostly starlight in\na swirling mass down to destruction!  And in a minute we were so close\nto the edge of the fall I could see the water break into ridges as it\nfelt the solid bottom give way under it.  We were so close that already\nthe foremost rafts, ten yards ahead, were tipping and their occupants\none by one waving their arms about and tumbling from their funeral\nchairs as they shot into the spray veil and went out of sight under a\nfaint rainbow that was arched over there, the symbol of peace and the\nonly lovely thing in that gruesome region.  Another minute and I must\nhave gone with them. It was too late to think of getting out of the\ntangle then; the water behind was heavy with trailing silks and\nflowers.  We were jammed together almost like one huge float and in\nthat latter fact lay my one chance.\n\nOn the left was a low ledge of rocks leading back to the narrow beach\nalready mentioned, and the ledge came out to within a few feet of where\nthe outmost boat on that side would pass it.  It was the only chance\nand a poor one, but already the first rank of my fleet was trembling on\nthe brink, and without stopping to weigh matters I bounded off my own\ncanoe on to the raft alongside, which rocked with my weight like a\ntea-tray. From that I leapt, with such hearty good-will as I had never\nhad before, on to a second and third.  I jumped from the footstool of\none Martian to the knee of another, steadying myself by a free use of\ntheir nodding heads as I passed.  And every time I jumped a ship\ncollapsed behind me. As I staggered with my spring into the last and\noutermost boat the ledge was still six feet away, half hidden in a\nsmother of foam, and the rim of the great fall just under it.  Then I\ndrew all my sailor agility together and just as the little vessel was\ngoing bow up over the edge I leapt from her--came down blinded with\nspray on the ledge, rolled over and over, clutched frantically at the\nfrozen soil, and was safe for the moment, but only a few inches from\nthe vortex below!\n\nAs soon as I picked myself up and got breath, I walked shorewards and\nfound, with great satisfaction, that the ledge joined the shelving\nbeach, and so walked on in the blue obscurity of the cliff shadow back\nfrom the falls in the bare hope that the beach might lead by some way\ninto the gully through which we had come and open country beyond.  But\nafter a couple of hundred yards this hope ended as abruptly as the spit\nitself in deep water, and there I was, as far as the darkness would\nallow me to ascertain, as utterly trapped as any mortal could be.\n\nI will not dwell on the next few minutes, for no one likes to\nacknowledge that he has been unmanned even for a space.  When those\nminutes were over calmness and consideration returned, and I was able\nto look about.\n\nAll the opposite cliffs, rising sheer from the water, were in light,\ntheir cold blue and white surfaces rising far up into the black\nstarfields overhead.  Looking at them intently from this vantage-point\nI saw without at first understanding that along them horizontally, tier\nabove tier, were rows of objects, like--like--why, good Heavens, they\nwere like men and women in all sorts of strange postures and positions!\nRubbing my eyes and looking again I perceived with a start and a\nstrange creepy feeling down my back that they WERE men and\nwomen!--hundreds of them, thousands, all in rows as cormorants stand\nupon sea-side cliffs, myriads and myriads now I looked about, in every\nconceivable pose and attitude but never a sound, never a movement\namongst the vast concourse.\n\nThen I turned back to the cliffs behind me.  Yes! they ere there too,\ndimmer by reason of the shadows, but there for certain, from the\nsnowfields far above down, down--good Heavens! to the very level where\nI stood.  There was one of them not ten yards away half in and half out\nof the ice wall, and setting my teeth I walked over and examined him.\nAnd there was another further in behind as I peered into the clear blue\ndepth, another behind that one, another behind him--just like cherries\nin a jelly.\n\nIt was startling and almost incredible, yet so many wonderful things\nhad happened of late that wonders were losing their sharpness, and I\nwas soon examining the cliff almost as coolly as though it were only\nsome trivial geological \"section,\" some new kind of petrified\nsea-urchins which had caught my attention and not a whole nation in\nice, a huge amphitheatre of fossilised humanity which stared down on me.\n\nThe matter was simple enough when you came to look at it with\nphilosophy. The Martians had sent their dead down here for many\nthousand years and as they came they were frozen in, the bands and\nzones in which they sat indicating perhaps alternating seasons.  Then\nafter Nature had been storing them like that for long ages some\nupheaval happened, and this cleft and lake opened through the heart of\nthe preserve.  Probably the river once ran far up there where the\nstarlight was crowning the blue cliffs with a silver diadem of light,\nonly when this hollow opened did it slowly deepen a lower course,\nspreading out in a lake, and eventually tumbling down those icy steps\nlose itself in the dark roots of the hills. It was very simple, no\ndoubt, but incredibly weird and wonderful to me who stood, the sole\nliving thing in that immense concourse of dead humanity.\n\nLook where I would it was the same everywhere.  Those endless rows of\nfrozen bodies lying, sitting, or standing stared at me from every niche\nand cornice.  It almost seemed, as the light veered slowly round, as\nthough they smiled and frowned at times, but never a word was there\namongst those millions; the silence itself was audible, and save the\ndull low thunder of the fall, so monotonous the ear became accustomed\nto and soon disregarded it, there was not a sound anywhere, not a\nrustle, not a whisper broke the eternal calm of that great caravansary\nof the dead.\n\nThe very rattle of the shingle under my feet and the jingle of my navy\nscabbard seemed offensive in the perfect hush, and, too awed to be\nfrightened, I presently turned away from the dreadful shine of those\ncliffs and felt my way along the base of the wall on my own side. There\nwas no means of escape that way, and presently the shingle beach itself\ngave out as stated, where the cliff wall rose straight from the surface\nof the lake, so I turned back, and finding a grotto in the ice\ndetermined to make myself as comfortable as might be until daylight\ncame.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFortunately there was a good deal of broken timber thrown up at\n\"high-water\" mark, and with a stack of this at the mouth of the little\ncave a pleasant fire was soon made by help of a flint pebble and the\nsteel back of my sword.  It was a hearty blaze and lit up all the near\ncliffs with a ruddy jumping glow which gave their occupants a\nmarvellous appearance of life.  The heat also brought off the dull rime\nupon the side of my recess, leaving it clear as polished glass, and I\nwas a little startled to see, only an inch or so back in the ice and\nstanding as erect as ever he had been in life, the figure of an\nimposing grey clad man. His arms were folded, his chin dropped upon his\nchest, his robes of the finest stuff, the very flowers they had decked\nhis head with frozen with immortality, and under them, round his crisp\nand iron-grey hair, a simple band of gold with strange runes and\nfigures engraved upon it.\n\nThere was something very simple yet stately about him, though his face\nwas hidden and as I gazed long and intently the idea got hold of me\nthat he had been a king over an undegenerate Martian race, and had\nstood waiting for the Dawn a very, very long time.\n\nI wished a little that he had not been quite so near the glassy surface\nof the ice down which the warmth was bringing quick moisture drops. Had\nhe been back there in the blue depths where others were sitting and\ncrouching it would have been much more comfortable.  But I was a\nsailor, and misfortune makes strange companions, so I piled up the fire\nagain, and lying down presently on the dry shingle with my back to him\nstared moodily at the blaze till slowly the fatigues of the day told,\nmy eyelids dropped and, with many a fitful start and turn, at length I\nslept.\n\nIt was an hour before dawn, the fire had burnt low and I was dreaming\nof an angry discussion with my tailor in New York as to the sit of my\nlast new trousers when a faint sound of moving shingle caught my quick\nseaman ear, and before I could raise my head or lift a hand, a man's\nweight was on me--a heavy, strong man who bore me down with\nirresistible force. I felt the slap of his ice-cold hand upon my throat\nand his teeth in the back of my neck!  In an instant, though but half\nawake, with a yell of surprise and anger I grappled with the enemy, and\nexerting all my strength rolled him over.  Over and over we went\nstruggling towards the fire, and when I got him within a foot or so of\nit I came out on top, and, digging my knuckles into his throttle,\nbanged his head upon the stony floor in reckless rage, until all of a\nsudden it seemed to me he was done for.  I relaxed my grip, but the\nother man never moved. I shook him again, like a terrier with a rat,\nbut he never resented it. Had I killed him? How limp and cold he was!\nAnd then all of a sudden an uneasy feeling came upon me.  I reached\nout, and throwing a handful of dried stuff upon the embers the fire\ndanced gaily up into the air, and the blaze showed me I was savagely\nholding down to the gravel and kneeling on the chest of that long-dead\nking from my grotto wall!\n\nIt was the man out of the ice without a doubt.  There was the very\nniche he had fallen from under the influence of the fire heat, the very\nrecess, exactly in his shape in every detail, whence he had stood\ngazing into vacuity all those years.  I left go my hold, and after the\nflutter in my heart had gone down, apologetically set him up against\nthe wall of the cavern whence he had fallen; then built up the fire\nuntil twirling flames danced to the very roof in the blue light of\ndawn, and hobgoblin shadows leapt and capered about us.  Then once more\nI sat down on the opposite side of the blaze, resting my chin upon my\nhands, and stared into the frozen eyes of that grim stranger, who, with\nhis chin upon his knees, stared back at me with irresistible,\nremorseless steadfastness.\n\nHe was as fresh as if he had died but yesterday, yet by his clothing\nand something in his appearance, which was not that of the Martian of\nto-day, I knew he might be many thousand years old.  What things he had\nseen, what wonders he knew!  What a story might be put into his mouth\nif I were a capable writer gifted with time and imagination instead of\na poor outcast, ill-paid lieutenant whose literary wit is often taxed\nhardly to fill even a log-book entry!  I stared at him so long and\nhard, and he at me through the blinking flames, that again I dozed--and\ndozed--and dozed again until at last when I woke in good earnest it was\ndaylight.\n\nBy this time hunger was very aggressive.  The fire was naught but a\ncirclet of grey ashes; the dead king, still sitting against the\ncave-side, looked very blue and cold, and with an uncomfortable\nrealisation of my position I shook myself together, picked up and\npocketed without much thought the queer gold circlet that had dropped\nfrom his forehead, and went outside to see what prospect of escape the\nnew day had brought.\n\nIt was not much.  Upriver there was not the remotest chance.  Not even\na Niagara steamer could have forged back against the sluice coming down\nfrom the gulch there.  Looking round, the sides of the icy\namphitheatre--just lighting up now with glorious gold and crimson\nglimmers of morning--were as steep as a wall face; only back towards\nthe falls was there a possibility of getting out of the dreadful trap,\nso thither I went, after a last look at the poor old king, along my\nnarrow beach with all the eagerness begotten of a final chance.  Up to\nthe very brink it looked hopeless enough, but, looking downwards when\nthat was reached, instead of a sheer drop the slope seemed to be a wild\n\"staircase\" of rocks and icy ledges with here and there a little patch\nof sand on a cornice, and far below, five hundred feet or so, a good\nbig spread of gravel an acre or two in extent close by where the river\nplunged out of sight into the nethermost cavern mouth.\n\nIt was so hopeless up above it, it could not possibly be worse further\ndown, and there was the ugly black flood running into the hole to trust\nmyself to as a last resource; so slipping and sliding I began the\ndescent.\n\nHad I been a schoolboy with a good breakfast ahead the incident might\nhave been amusing enough.  The travelling was mostly done on the seat\nof my trousers, which consequently became caked with mud and glacial\nloam. Some was accomplished on hands and knees, with now and then a bit\ndown a snow slope, in good, honest head-over-heels fashion.  The result\nwas a fine appetite for the next meal when it should please providence\nto send it, and an abrupt arrival on the bottom beach about five\nminutes after leaving the upper circles.\n\nI came to behind a cluster of breast-high rocks, and before moving took\na look round.  Judge then of my astonishment and delight at the second\nglance to perceive about a hundred yards away a brown object, looking\nlike an ape in the half light, meandering slowly up the margin of the\nwater towards me.  Every now and then it stopped, stooping down to pick\nup something or other from the scum along the torrent, and it was the\nfact that these trifles, whatever they were, were put into a wallet by\nthe vision's side--not into his mouth--which first made me understand\nwith a joyful thrill that it was a MAN before me--a real, living man in\nthis huge chamber of dead horrors!  Then again it flashed across my\nmind in a luminous moment that where one man could come, or go, or\nlive, another could do likewise, and never did cat watch mouse with\nmore concentrated eagerness than I that quaint, bent-shouldered thing\nhobbling about in the blue morning shadows where all else was silence.\n\nNearer and nearer he came, till so close face and garb were\ndiscernible, and then there could no longer be any doubt, it was a\nwoodman, an old man, with grizzled monkey-face, stooping gait, and a\nshaggy fur cloak, utterly unlike the airy garments of my Hither folk,\nwho now stood before me. It gave me quite a start to recognise him\nthere, for it showed I was in a new land, and since he was going so\ncheerfully about his business, whatever it might chance to be, there\nmust be some way out of this accursed pit in which I had fallen.  So\nvery cautiously I edged out, taking advantage of all the cover possible\nuntil we were only twenty yards apart, and then suddenly standing up,\nand putting on the most affable smile, I called out--\n\n\"Hullo, mess-mate!\"\n\nThe effect was electrical.  That quaint old fellow sprang a yard into\nair as though a spring had shot him up.  Then, coming down, he stood\ntransfixed at his full height as stiff as a ramrod, staring at me with\nincredible wonder.  He looked so funny that in spite of hunger and\nloneliness I burst out laughing, whereat the woodman, suddenly\nrecovering his senses, turned on his heels and set off at his best pace\nin the opposite direction.  This would never do!  I wanted him to be my\nguide, philosopher, and friend.  He was my sole visible link with the\noutside world, so after him I went at tip-top speed, and catching him\nup in fifty yards along the shingle laid hold of his nether garments.\nWhereat the old fellow stopping suddenly I shot clean over his back,\ncoming down on my shoulder in the gravel.\n\nBut I was much younger than he, and in a minute was in chase again.\nThis time I laid hold of his cloak, and the moment he felt my grip he\nslipped the neck-thongs and left me with only the mangy garment in my\nhands.  Again we set off, dodging and scampering with all our might\nupon that frozen bit of beach.  The activity of that old fellow was\nmarvellous, but I could not and would not lose him.  I made a rush and\ngrappled him, but he tossed his head round and slipped away once more\nunder my arm, as though he had been brought up by a Chinese wrestler.\nThen he got on one side of a flat rock, I the other, and for three or\nfour minutes we waltzed round that slab in the most insane manner.\n\nBut by this time we were both pretty well spent--he with age and I with\nfaintness from my long fast, and we came presently to a standstill.\n\nAfter glaring at me for a time, the woodman gasped out as he struggled\nfor breath--\n\n\"Oh, mighty and dreadful spirit!  Oh, dweller in primordial ice, say\nfrom which niche of the cliffs has the breath of chance thawed you?\"\n\n\"Never a niche at all, Mr. Hunter-for-Haddocks'-Eyes,\" I  answered as\nsoon as I could speak.  \"I am just a castaway wrecked last night on\nthis shore of yours, and very grateful indeed will I be if you can show\nme the way to some breakfast first, and afterwards to the outside\nworld.\"\n\nBut the old fellow would not believe.  \"Spirits such as you,\" he said\nsullenly, \"need no food, and go whither they will by wish alone.\"\n\n\"I tell you I am not a spirit, and as hungry as I don't particularly\nwant to be again.  Here, look at the back of my trousers, caked three\ninches deep in mud.  If I were a spirit, do you think I would slide\nabout on my coat-tails like that?  Do you think that if I could travel\nby volition I would slip down these infernal cliffs on my pants' seat\nas I have just done? And as for materialism--look at this fist; it\npunched you just now! Surely there was nothing spiritual in that\nknock?''\n\n\"No,\" said the savage, rubbing his head, \"it was a good, honest rap, so\nI must take you at your word.  If you are indeed man, and hungry, it\nwill be a charity to feed you; if you are a spirit, it will at least be\ninteresting to watch you eat; so sit down, and let's see what I have in\nmy wallet.\"\n\nSo cross-legged we squatted opposite each other on the table rock, and,\nfeeling like another Sindbad the Sailor, I watched my new friend fumble\nin his bag and lay out at his side all sorts of odds and ends of\nstring, fish-hooks, chewing-gum, material for making a fire, and so on,\nuntil at last he came to a package (done up, I noted with delight, in a\nbroad, green leaf which had certainly been growing that morning), and\nunrolling it, displayed a lump of dried meat, a few biscuits, much\nthicker and heavier than the honey-cakes of the Hither folk, and\nsomething that looked and smelt like strong, white cheese.\n\nHe signed to me to eat, and you may depend upon it I was not slow in\naccepting the invitation.  That tough biltong tasted to me like the\ntenderest steak that ever came from a grill; the biscuits were\nambrosial; the cheese melted in my mouth as butter melts in that of the\nvirtuous; but when the old man finished the quaint picnic by inviting\nme to accompany him down to the waterside for a drink, I shook my head.\nI had a great respect for dead queens and kings, I said, but there were\ntoo many of them up above to make me thirsty this morning; my respect\ndid not go to making me desire to imbibe them in solution!\n\nAfterwards I chanced to ask him what he had been picking up just now\nalong the margin, and after looking at me suspiciously for a minute he\nasked--\n\n\"You are not a thief?\"  On being reassured on that point he continued:\n\"And you will not attempt to rob me of the harvest for which I venture\ninto this ghost-haunted glen, which you and I alone of living men have\nseen?\"\n\n\"No.\"  Whatever they were, I said, I would respect his earnings.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said the old man, \"look here!  I come hither to pick\nup those pretty trifles which yonder lords and ladies have done with,\"\nand plunging his hand into another bag he brought out a perfect fistful\nof splendid gems and jewels, some set and some unset.  \"They wash from\nthe hands and wrists of those who have lodgings in the crevices of the\nfalls above,\" he explained.  \"After a time the beach here will be thick\nwith them.  Could I get up whence you came down, they might be gathered\nby the sackful.  Come!  there is an eddy still unsearched, and I will\nshow you how they lie.\"\n\nIt was very fascinating, and I and that old man set to work amongst the\ngravels, and, to be brief, in half an hour found enough glittering\nstuff to set up a Fifth Avenue jeweller's shop.  But to tell the truth,\nnow that I had breakfasted, and felt manhood in my veins again, I was\neager to be off, and out of the close, death-tainted atmosphere of that\nvalley. Consequently I presently stood up and said--\n\n\"Look here, old man, this is fine sport no doubt, but just at present I\nhave a big job on hand--one which will not wait, and I must be going.\nSee, luck and young eyes have favoured me; here is twice as much gold\nand stones as you have got together--it is all yours without a question\nif you will show me the way out of this den and afterwards put me on\nthe road to your big city, for thither I am bound with an errand to\nyour king, Ar-hap.\"\n\nThe sight of my gems, backed, perhaps, with the mention of Ar-hap's\nname, appealed to the old fellow; and after a grunt or two about\n\"losing a tide\" just when spoil was so abundant, he accepted the\nbargain, shouldered his belongings, and led me towards the far corner\nof the beach.\n\nIt looked as if we were walking right against the towering ice wall,\nbut when we were within a yard or two of it a narrow cleft, only\neighteen inches wide, and wonderfully masked by an ice column, showed\nto the left, and into this we squeezed ourselves, the entrance by which\nwe had come appearing to close up instantly we had gone a pace or two,\nso perfectly did the ice walls match each other.\n\nIt was the most uncanny thoroughfare conceivable--a sheer, sharp crack\nin the blue ice cliffs extending from where the sunlight shone in a\ndazzling golden band five hundred feet overhead to where bottom was\ntouched in blue obscurity of the ice-foot.  It was so narrow we had to\ntravel sideways for the most part, a fact which brought my face close\nagainst the clear blue glass walls, and enabled me from time to time to\nsee, far back in those translucent depths, more and more and evermore\nfrozen Martians waiting in stony silence for their release.\n\nBut the fact of facts was that slowly the floor of the cleft trended\nupwards, whilst the sky strip appeared to come downwards to meet it. A\nmile, perhaps, we growled and squeezed up that wonderful gully; then\nwith a feeling of incredible joy I felt the clear, outer air smiting\nupon me.\n\nIn my hurry and delight I put my head into the small of the back of the\npuffing old man who blocked the way in front and forced him forward,\nuntil at last--before we expected it--the cleft suddenly ended, and he\nand I tumbled headlong over each other on to a glittering, frozen\nsnowslope; the sky azure overhead, the sunshine warm as a tepid bath,\nand a wide prospect of mountain and plain extending all around.\n\nSo delightful was the sudden change of circumstances that I became\nquite boyish, and seizing the old man in my exuberance by the hands,\ndragged him to his feet, and danced him round and round in a circle,\nwhile his ancient hair flapped about his head, his skin cloak waved\nfrom his shoulders like a pair of dusky wings and half-eaten cakes,\ndried flesh, glittering jewels, broken diadems, and golden finger-rings\nwere flung in an arc about us.  We capered till fairly out of breath,\nand then, slapping him on the back shoulder, I asked whose land all\nthis was about us.\n\nHe replied that it was no one's, all waste from verge to verge.\n\n\"What!\" was my exclamation.  \"All ownerless, and with so much treasure\nhidden hereabout!  Why, I shall annex it to my country, and you and I\nwill peg out original settlers' claims!\"  And, still excited by the\nmountain air, I whipped out my sword, and in default of a star-spangled\nbanner to plant on the newly-acquired territory, traced in gigantic\nletters on the snow-crust--U.S.A.\n\n\"And now,\" I added, wiping the rime off my blade with the lappet of my\ncoat, \"let us stop capering about here and get to business.  You have\npromised to put me on the way to your big city.\"\n\n\"Come on then,\" said the little man, gathering up his property. \"This\nwhite hillside leads to nowhere; we must get into the valley first, and\nthen you shall see your road.\"  And right well that quaint barbarian\nkept his promise.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIt was half a day's march from those glittering snow-fields into the\nlow country, and when that was reached I found myself amongst quite\nanother people.\n\nThe land was no longer fat and flowery, giving every kind of produce\nfor the asking, but stony for the most part, and, where we first came\non vegetation, overgrown by firs, with a pine which looked to me like a\nspecies which went to make the coal measures in my dear but distant\nplanet.  More than this I cannot say, for there are no places in the\nworld like mess-room and quarter-deck for forgetting school learning.\nInstead of the glorious wealth of parti-coloured vegetation my eyes had\nbeen accustomed to lately, here they rested on infertile stretches of\nmarshland intersected by moss-covered gravel shoots, looking as though\nthey had been pushed into the plains in front of extinct glaciers\ncoming down from the region behind us.  On the low hills away from the\nsea those sombre evergreen forests with an undergrowth of moss and red\nlichens were more variegated with light foliage, and indeed the pines\nproved to be but a fringe to the Arctic ice, giving way rapidly to more\ntypical Martian vegetation each mile we marched to the southward.\n\nAs for the inhabitants, they seemed, like my guide, rough, uncouth\nfellows, but honest enough when you came to know them.  An\nintroduction, however, was highly desirable.  I chanced upon the first\nnative as he was gathering reindeer-moss.  My companion was some little\nway behind at the moment, and when the gentle aborigine saw the\nstranger he stared hard for a moment, then, turning on his heels, with\nextraordinary swiftness flung at me half a pound of hard flint stone.\nHad his aim been a little more careful this humble narrative had never\nappeared on the Broadway bookstalls.  As it was, the pebble, missing my\nhead by an inch or two, splintered into a hundred fragments on a rock\nbehind, and while I was debating whether a revengeful rush at the\nslinger or a strategic advance to the rear were more advisable, my\nguide called out to his countryman--\n\n\"Ho! you base prowler in the morasses; you eater of unclean vegetation,\ndo you not see this is a ghost I am conducting, a dweller in the ice\ncliffs, a spirit ten thousand years old? Put by your sling lest he\nwither you with a glance.\"  And, very reasonably, surprised, the\naborigine did as he was bid and cautiously advanced to inspect me.\n\nThe news soon spread over the countryside that my jewel-hunter was\nbringing a live \"spook\" along with him, considerable curiosity mixed\nwith an awe all to my advantage characterising the people we met\nthereafter. Yet the wonder was not so great as might have been\nexpected, for these people were accustomed to meeting the tags of lost\nraces, and though they stared hard, their interest was chiefly in\nhearing how, when, and where I had been found, whether I bit or kicked,\nor had any other vices, and if I possessed any commercial value.\n\nMy guide's throat must have ached with the repetition of the narrative,\nbut as he made the story redound greatly to his own glory, he put up\ncheerfully with the hoarseness.  In this way, walking and talking\nalternately, we travelled during daylight through a country which\nslowly lost its rugged features and became more and more inhabited, the\nhardy people living in scattered villages in contradiction to the\ndebased city-loving Hither folk.\n\nAbout nightfall we came to a sea-fishers' hamlet, where, after the old\nman had explained my exalted nature and venerable antiquity, I was\noffered shelter for the night.\n\nMy host was the headman, and I must say his bearing towards the\nsupernatural was most unaffected.  If it had been an Avenue hotel I\ncould not have found more handsome treatment than in that reed-thatched\nhut. They made me wash and rest, and then were all agog for my history;\nbut that I postponed, contenting myself with telling them I had been\nlately in Seth, and had come thence to see them via the ice valley--to\nall of which they listened with the simplicity of children.  Afterwards\nI turned on them, and openly marvelled that so small a geographical\ndistance as there was between that land and this could make so vast a\nhuman difference. \"The truth, O dweller in blue shadows of primordial\nice, is,\" said the most intelligent of the Thither folk as we sat over\nfried deer-steak in his hut that evening, \"we who are MEN, not\nPeri-zad, not overstayed fairies like those you have been amongst, are\nnewcomers here on this shore.  We came but a few generations ago from\nwhere the gold curtains of the sun lie behind the westward pine-trees,\nand as we came we drove, year by year, those fays, those spent\ntriflers, back before us.  All this land was theirs once, and more and\nmore towards our old home.  You may still see traces of harbours dug\nand cities built thousands of years ago, when the Hither folk were\nliving men and women--not their shadows. The big water outside stops us\nfor a space, but,\" he added, laughing gruffly and taking a draught of a\nstrong beer he had been heating by the fire, \"King Ar-hap has their\npretty noses between his fingers; he takes tribute and girls while he\ngets ready--they say he is nearly ready this summer, and if he is, it\nwill not be much of an excuse he will need to lick up the last of those\ntriflers, those pretences of manhood.\"\n\nThen we fell to talking of Ar-hap, his subjects and town, and I learned\nthe tides had swept me a long way to the northward of the proper route\nbetween the capitals of the two races, that day they carried me into\nthe Dead-Men's Ice, as these entertainers of mine called the northern\nsnows. To get back to the place previously aimed at, where the woodmen\nroad came out on the seashore, it was necessary to go either by boat, a\nroundabout way through a maze of channels, \"as tangled as the grass\nroots in autumn\"; or, secondly, by a couple of days' marching due\nsouthward across the base of the great peninsula we were on, and so\nstrike blue water again at the long-sought-for harbour.\n\nAs I lay dozing and dreaming on a pile of strange furs in the corner of\nthe hut that evening I made up my mind for the land journey tomorrow,\nhaving had enough for the moment of nautical Martian adventures; and\nthis point settled, fell again to wondering what made me follow so\nreckless a quest in the way I was doing; asking myself again and again\nwhat was gazelle-eyed Heru to me after all, and why should it matter\neven as much as the value of a brass waist-coat button whether Hath had\nher or Ar-hap? What a fool I was to risk myself day by day in quaint\nand dangerous adventures, wearing out good Government shoe-leather in\nother men's quarrels, all for a silly slip of royal girlhood who, by\nthis time, was probably making herself comfortable and forgetting both\nHath and me in the arms of her rough new lord.\n\nAnd from Heru my mind drifted back dreamily to poor An, and Seth, the\ncity of fallen magnificence, where the spent masters of a strange\nplanet now lived on sufferance--the ghosts of their former selves.\nWhere was An, where the revellers on the morning--so long ago it\nseemed!--when first that infernal rug of mine translated a chance wish\ninto a horrible reality and shot me down here, a stranger and an\noutcast? Where was the magic rug itself? Where my steak and tomato\nsupper? Who had eaten it? Who was drawing my pay? If I could but find\nthe rug when I got back to Seth, gods! but I would try if it would not\nreturn whence I had come, and as swiftly, out of all these silly coils\nand adventuring.\n\nSo musing, presently the firelight died down, and bulky forms of\nhide-wrapped woodmen sleeping on the floor slowly disappeared in\nobscurity like ranges of mountains disappearing in the darkness of\nnight.  All those uncouth forms, and the throb of the sea outside,\npresently faded upon my senses, and I slept the heavy sleep of one\nwhose wakefulness gives way before an imperious physical demand.  All\nthrough the long hours of the night, while the waves outside champed\nupon the gravels, and the woodmen snored and grunted uneasily as they\nsimultaneously dreamt of the day's hunting and digested its proceeds, I\nslept; and then when dawn began to break I passed from that heavy\nstupor into another and lighter realm, wherein fancy again rose\nsuperior to bodily fatigue, and events of the last few days passed in\nprocession through my mind.\n\nI dreamt I was lunching at a fashionable seaside resort with Polly at\nmy side, and An kept bringing us melons, which grew so monstrous every\ntime a knife was put into them that poor Polly screamed aloud. I dreamt\nI was afloat on a raft, hotly pursued by my tailor, whose bare and\nshiny head--may Providence be good to him!--was garlanded with roses,\nwhile in his fist was a bunch of unpaid bills, the which he waved\naloft, shouting to me to stop.  And thus we danced down an ink-black\nriver until he had chiveyed me into the vast hall of the Admiralty,\nwhere a fearsome Secretary, whose golden teeth rattled and dropped from\nhis head with mingled cold and anger, towered above me as he asked why\nI was absent from my ship without leave.  And I was just mumbling out\nexcuses while stooping to pick up his golden dentistry, when some one\nstirring in the hut aroused me.  I started up on my elbow and looked\naround.  Where was I? For a minute all was confused and dark.  The\nheavy mound-like forms of sleeping men, the dim outlines of their\nhunting gear upon the walls, the pale sea beyond, half seen through the\nopen doorway, just turning livid in the morning light; and then as my\neyes grew more accustomed to the obscurity, and my stupid senses\nreturned, I recognised the surroundings, and, with a sigh, remembered\nyesterday's adventures.\n\nHowever, it would never do to mope; so, rising silently and picking a\nway through human lumber on the floor, I went out and down to the\nwater's edge, where \"shore-going\" clothes, as we sailors call them,\nwere slipped off, and I plunged into the sea for a swim.\n\nIt was a welcome dip, for I needed the plunge physically and\nintellectually, but it came to an abrupt conclusion.  The Thither folk\napparently had never heard of this form of enjoyment; to them water\nstood for drinking or drowning, nothing else, and since one could not\ndrink the sea, to be in it meant, even for a ghost, to drown.\nConsequently, when the word went round the just rousing villages that\n\"He-on-foot-from-afar\" was adrift in the waves, rescue parties were\nhurriedly organised, a boat launched, and, in spite of all my kicking\nand shouting (which they took to be evidence of my semi-moribund\ncondition), I was speedily hauled out by hairy and powerful hands,\npungent herbs burnt under my nose, and my heels held high in the air in\norder that the water might run out of me. It was only with the greatest\ndifficulty those rough but honest fellows were eventually got to\nbelieve me saved.\n\nThe breakfast I made of grilled deer flesh and a fish not unlike\nsalmon, however, convinced them of my recovery, and afterward we parted\nvery good friends; for there was something in the nature of those\nrugged barbarians just coming into the dawn of civilisation that won my\nliking far more than the effete gentleness of others across the water.\n\nWhen the time of parting came they showed no curiosity as to my errand,\nbut just gave me some food in a fish-skin bag, thrust a heavy\nstone-headed axe into my hand, \"in case I had to talk to a thief on the\nroad,\" and pointed out on the southern horizon a forked mountain, under\nwhich, they said, was the harbour and high-road to King Ar-hap's\ncapital. Then they hugged me to their hairy chests in turn, and let me\ngo with a traveller's blessing.\n\nThere I was again, all alone, none but my thoughts for companions, and\nnothing but youth to excuse the folly in thus venturing on a reckless\nquest!\n\nHowever, who can gainsay that same youth? The very spice of danger made\nmy steps light and the way pleasant.  For a mile or two the track was\nplain enough, through an undulating country gradually becoming more and\nmore wooded with vegetation, changing rapidly from Alpine to\nsub-tropical. The air also grew warmer, and when the dividing ridge was\ncrossed and a thick forest entered, the snows and dreadful region of\nDeadmen's Ice already seemed leagues and leagues away.\n\nProbably a warm ocean current played on one side of the peninsula,\nwhile a cold one swept the other, but for scientific aspects of the\nquestion I cared little in my joy at being anew in a soft climate,\namongst beautiful flowers and vivid life again.  Mile after mile\nslipped quickly by as I strode along, whistling \"Yankee Doodle\" to\nmyself and revelling in the change.  At one place I met a rough-looking\nMartian woodcutter, who wanted to fight until he found I also wanted\nto, when he turned very civil and as talkative as a solitary liver\noften is when his tongue gets started.  He particularly desired to know\nwhere I came from, and, as in the case with so many other of his\ncountrymen, took it for granted, and with very little surprise, that I\nwas either a spirit or an inhabitant of another world.  With this idea\nin his mind he gave me a curious piece of information, which,\nunfortunately, I was never able to follow up.\n\n\"I don't think you can be a spirit,\" he said, critically eyeing my\nclothes, which were now getting ragged and dirty beyond description.\n\"They are finer-looking things than you, and I doubt if their toes come\nthrough their shoes like yours do.  If you are a wanderer from the\nstars, you are not like that other one we have down yonder,\" and he\npointed to the southward.\n\n\"What!\" I asked, pricking my ears in amazement, \"another wanderer from\nthe outside world!  Does he come from the earth?\"--using the word An\nhad given me to signify my own planet.\n\n\"No, not from there; from the one that burns blue in evening between\nsun and sea.  Men say he worked as a stoker or something of the kind\nwhen he was at home, and got trifling with a volcano tap, and was\nlapped in hot mud, and blown out here.  My brother saw him about a week\nago.\"\n\n\"Now what you say is down right curious.  I thought I had a monopoly of\nthat kind of business in this sphere of yours.  I should be\ntremendously interested to see him.\"\n\n\"No you wouldn't,\" briefly answered the woodman.  \"He is the stupidest\nfool ever blown from one world to another--more stupid to look at than\nyou are.  He is a gaseous, wavey thing, so glum you can't get two words\na week out of him, and so unstable that you never know when you are\nwith him and when the breeze has drifted him somewhere else.\"\n\nI could but laugh and insist, with all respect to the woodcutter, such\nan individual were worth the knowing however unstable his constitution;\nat which the man shrugged his shoulders and changed the conversation,\nas though the subject were too trivial to be worth much consideration.\n\nThis individual gave me the pleasure of his company until nearly\nsundown, and finding I took an interest in things of the forest,\npointed out more curious plants and trees than I have space to mention.\nTwo of them, however, cling to my memory very tenaciously.  One was a\nvery Circe amongst plants, the horrible charm of which can never be\nforgotten. We were going down a glade when a most ravishing odour fell\nupon my nostrils.  It was heavenly sweet yet withal there lurked an\nincredibly, unexpressibly tempting spice of wickedness in it.  The\nmoment he caught that ambrosial invitation in the air my woodman spit\nfiercely on the ground, and taking a plug of wool from his pouch\nstuffed his nostrils up. Then he beckoned me to come away.  But the\nodour was too ravishing, I was bound to see whence it arose, and\nfinding me deaf to all warnings, the man reluctantly turned aside down\nthe enticing trail.  We pushed about a hundred yards through bushes\nuntil we came to a little arena full in sunshine where there were\nneither birds nor butterflies, but a death-like hush upon everything.\nIndeed, the place seemed shunned in spite of the sodden loveliness of\nthat scent which monopolised and mounted to my brain until I was\nbeginning to be drunk with the sheer pleasure of it. And there in the\ncentre of the space stood a plant not unlike a tree fern, about six\nfeet high, and crowned by one huge and lovely blossom. It resembled a\nvast passion-flower of incredible splendour.  There were four petals,\nwith points resting on the ground, each six feet long, ivory-white\ninside, exquisitely patterned with glittering silver veins. From the\nbase of these rose upright a gauzy veil of azure filaments of the same\nlength as the petals, wirelike, yet soft as silk, and inside them again\nrested a chalice of silver holding a tiny pool of limpid golden honey.\nCirce, indeed!  It was from that cup the scent arose, and my throat\ngrew dry with longing as I looked at it; my eyes strained through the\nblue tendrils towards that liquid nectar, and my giddy senses felt they\nmust drink or die!  I glanced at the woodman with a smile of drunken\nhappiness, then turned tottering legs towards the blossom. A stride up\nthe smooth causeway of white petals, a push through the azure haze, and\nthe wine of the wood enchantress would be mine--molten amber wine,\nhotter and more golden than the sunshine; the fire of it was in my\nveins, the recklessness of intoxication was on me, life itself as\nnothing compared to a sip from that chalice, my lips must taste or my\nsoul would die, and with trembling hand and strained face I began to\nclimb.\n\nBut the woodman pulled me back.\n\n\"Back, stranger!\" he cried.  \"Those who drink there never live again.\"\n\n\"Blessed oblivion!  If I had a thousand lives the price were still too\ncheap,\" and once more I essayed to scramble up.\n\nBut the man was a big fellow, and with nostrils plugged, and eyes\naverted from the deadly glamour, he seized me by the collar and threw\nme back. Three times I tried, three times he hurled me down, far too\nfaint and absorbed to heed the personal violence.  Then standing\nbetween us, \"Look,\" he said, \"look and learn.\"\n\nHe had killed a small ape that morning, meaning later on to take its\nfur for clothing, and this he now unslung from his shoulder, and\nhitching the handle of his axe into the loose skin at the back of its\nneck, cautiously advanced to the witch plant, and gently hoisted the\nmonkey over the blue palings.  The moment its limp, dead feet touched\nthe golden pool a shudder passed through the plant, and a bird\nsomewhere far back in the forest cried out in horror.  Quick as\nthought, a spasm of life shot up the tendrils, and like tongues of blue\nflame they closed round the victim, lapping his miserable body in their\nembrace.  At the same time the petals began to rise, showing as they\ndid so hard, leathery, unlovely outer rinds, and by the time the\nwoodman was back at my side the flower was closed.\n\nCloser and closer wound the blue tendrils; tighter and tighter closed\nthe cruel petals with their iron grip, until at last we heard the ape's\nbones crackling like dry firewood; then next his head burst, his brains\ncame oozing through the crevices, while blood and entrails followed\nthem through every cranny, and the horrible mess with the overflow of\nthe chalice curled down the stem in a hundred steaming rills, till at\nlast the petals locked with an ugly snap upon their ghastly meal, and I\nturned away from the sight in dread and loathing.\n\nThat was plant Number One.\n\nPlant Number Two was of milder disposition, and won a hearty laugh for\nmy friendly woodman.  In fact, being of a childlike nature, his success\nas a professor of botany quite pleased him, and not content with\nanswering my questions, he set to work to find new vegetable surprises,\ngreatly enjoying my wonder and the sense of importance it gave him.\n\nIn this way we came, later on in the day, to a spot where herbage was\nsomewhat scantier, the grass coarse, and soil shallow.  Here I espied a\ntree of small size, apparently withered, but still bearing a few\nparched leaves on its uppermost twigs.\n\n\"Now that,\" quoth the professor, \"is a highly curious tree, and I\nshould like you to make a close acquaintance with it.  It grows from a\nseed in the course of a single springtime, perishes in the summer; but\na few specimens stand throughout the winter, provided the situation is\nsheltered, as this one has done.  If you will kindly go down and shake\nits stem I believe you will learn something interesting.\"\n\nSo, very willing to humour him, away I went to the tree, which was\nperfect in every detail, but apparently very dry, clasped it with both\nhands, and, pulling myself together, gave it a mighty shake.  The\nresult was instantaneous.  The whole thing was nothing but a skin of\ndust, whence all fibre and sap had gone, and at my touch it dissolved\ninto a cloud of powder, a huge puff of white dust which descended on me\nas though a couple of flour-bags had been inverted over my head; and as\nI staggered out sneezing and blinking, white as a miller from face to\nfoot, the Martian burst into a wild, joyous peal of laughter that made\nthe woods ring again.  His merriment was so sincere I had not the heart\nto be angry, and soon laughed as loud as he did; though, for the\nfuture, I took his botanical essays with a little more caution.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThat woodman friend of mine proved so engaging it was difficult to get\naway, and thus when, dusk upon us, and my object still a long distance\noff, he asked me to spend the night at his hut, I gladly assented.\n\nWe soon reached the cabin where the man lived by himself whilst working\nin the forest.  It was a picturesque little place on a tree-overhung\nlagoon, thatched, wattled, and all about were piles of a\npleasant-scented bark, collected for the purpose of tanning hides, and\nI could not but marvel that such a familiar process should be practised\nidentically on two sides of the universal ether.  But as a matter of\nfact the similarity of many details of existence here and there was the\nmost striking of the things I learned whilst in the red planet.\n\nWithin the hut stood a hearth in the centre of the floor, whereon a\ncomfortable blaze soon sparkled, and upon the walls hung various\nimplements, hides, and a store of dried fruits of various novel kinds.\nMy host, when he had somewhat disdainfully watched me wash in a rill of\nwater close by, suggested supper, and I agreed with heartiest good will.\n\n\"Nothing wonderful!  Oh, Mr. Blue-coat!\" he said, prancing about as he\nmade his hospitable arrangements.  \"No fine meat or scented wine to\nunlock, one by one, all the doors of paradise, such as I have heard\nthey have in lands beyond the sea; but fare good enough for plain men\nwho eat but to live.  So! reach me down yonder bunch of yellow aru\nfruit, and don't upset that calabash, for all my funniest stories lurk\nat the bottom of it.\"\n\nI did as he bid, and soon we were squatting by the fire toasting arus\non pointed sticks, the doorway closed with a wattle hurdle, and the\nblack and gold firelight filling the hut with fantastic shadows.  Then\nwhen the banana-like fruit was ready, the man fetched from a recess a\nloaf of bread savoured with the dust of dried and pounded fish, put the\nforesaid calabash of strong ale to warm, and down we sat to supper with\nreal woodman appetites.  Seldom have I enjoyed a meal so much, and when\nwe had finished the fruit and the wheat cake my guide snatched up the\ngreat gourd of ale, and putting it to his lips called out:\n\n\"Here's to you, stranger; here's to your country; here's to your girl,\nif you have one, and death to your enemies!\"  Then he drank deep and\nlong, and, passed the stuff to me.\n\n\"Here's to you, bully host, and the missus, and the children, if there\nare any, and more power to your elbow!\"--the which gratified him\ngreatly, though probably he had small idea of my meaning.\n\nAnd right merry we were that evening.  The host was a jolly good\nfellow, and his ale, with a pleasant savour of mint in it, was the\nheartiest drink I ever set lips to.  We talked and laughed till the\nvery jackals yapped in sympathy outside.  And when he had told a score\nof wonderful wood stories as pungent of the life of these fairy forests\nas the aromatic scent of his bark-heaps outside, as iridescent with the\ncolours of another world as the rainbow bubbles riding down his starlit\nrill, I took a turn, and told him of the commonplaces of my world so\nfar away, whereat he laughed gloriously again.  The greater the\ncommonplace the larger his joy. The humblest story, hardly calculated\nto impress a griffin between watches on the main-deck, was a\nmasterpiece of wit to that gentle savage; and when I \"took off\" the\ntricks and foibles of some of my superiors--Heaven forgive me for such\ntreason!--he listened with the exquisite open-mouthed delight of one\nwho wanders in a brand-new world of mirth.\n\nWe drank and laughed over that strong beer till the little owls outside\nraised their voice in combined accord, and then the woodman, shaking\nthe last remnant of his sleepy wits together, and giving a reproachful\nlook at me for finally passing him the gourd empty to the last drop,\nrose, threw a fur on a pile of dead grass at one side of the hut, and\nbid me sleep, \"for his brain was giddy with the wonders of the\nincredible and ludicrous sphere which I had lately inhabited.\"\n\nSlowly the fire died away; slowly the quivering gold and black\narabesques on the walls merged in a red haze as the sticks dropped into\ntinder, and the great black outline of the hairy monster who had thrown\nhimself down by the embers rose up the walls against that flush like\nthe outline of a range of hills against a sunset glow.  I listened\ndrowsily for a space to his snoring and the laughing answer of the\nbrook outside, and then that ambrosial sleep which is the gentle\nattendant of hardship and danger touched my tired eyelids, and I, too,\nslept.\n\nMy friend was glum the next morning, as they who stay over-long at the\nsupper flagon are apt to be.  He had been at work an hour on his\nbark-heaps when I came out into the open, and it was only by a good\ndeal of diplomacy and some material help in sorting his faggots that he\nwas got into a better frame of mind.  I could not, however, trust his\nmood completely, and as I did not want to end so jovial a friendship\nwith a quarrel, I hurried through our breakfast of dry bread, with\nhard-boiled lizard eggs, and then settling my reckoning with one of the\nbrass buttons from my coat, which he immediately threaded, with every\nevidence of extreme gratification, on a string of trinkets hanging\nround his neck, asked him the way to Ar-hap's capital.\n\n\"Your way is easy, friend, as long as you keep to the straight path and\nhave yonder two-humped mountain in front.  To the left is the sea, and\nbehind the hill runs the canal and road by which all traffic comes or\ngoes to Ar-hap.  But above all things pass not to the hills right, for\nno man goes there; there away the forests are thick as night, and in\ntheir perpetual shadows are the ruins of a Hither city, a haunted fairy\ntown to which some travellers have been, but whence none ever returned\nalive.\"\n\n\"By the great Jove, that sounds promising!  I would like to see that\ntown if my errand were not so urgent.\"\n\nBut the old fellow shook his shaggy head and turned a shade yellower.\n\"It is no place for decent folk,\" he growled.  \"I myself once passed\nwithin a mile of its outskirts at dusk, and saw the unholy little\npeople's lanterned processions starting for the shrine of Queen Yang,\nwho, tradition says, killed herself and a thousand babies with her when\nwe took this land.\"\n\n\"My word, that was a holocaust!  Couldn't I drop in there to lunch? It\nwould make a fine paper for an antiquarian society.\"\n\nAgain the woodman frowned.  \"Do as I bid you, son.  You are too young\nand green to go on ventures by yourself.  Keep to the straight road:\nshun the swamps and the fairy forest, else will you never see Ar-hap.\"\n\n\"And as I have very urgent and very important business with him,\ncomrade, no doubt your advice is good.  I will call on Princess Yang\nsome other day.  And now goodbye!  Rougher but friendlier shelter than\nyou have given me no man could ask for.  I am downright sorry to part\nwith you in this lonely land.  If ever we meet again--\" but we never\ndid! The honest old churl clasped me into his hairy bosom three times,\nstuffed my wallet with dry fruit and bread, and once more repeating his\ndirections, sent me on my lonely way.\n\nI confess I sighed while turning into the forest, and looked back more\nthan once at his retreating form.  The loneliness of my position, the\nhopelessness of my venture, welled up in my heart after that good\ncomradeship, and when the hut was out of sight I went forward down the\ngreen grass road, chin on chest, for twenty minutes in the deepest\ndejection.  But, thank Heaven, I was born with a tough spirit, and\npossess a mind which has learned in many fights to give brave counsel\nto my spirit, and thus presently I shook myself together, setting my\nface boldly to the quest and the day's work.\n\nIt was not so clear a morning as the previous one, and a steamy wind on\nwhat at sea I should have called the starboard bow, as I pressed\nforward to the distant hill, had a curiously subduing effect on my\nthoughts, and filled the forest glades with a tremulous unreality like\nto nothing on our earth, and distinctly embarrassing to a stranger in a\nstrange land.  Small birds in that quaint atmospheric haze looked like\ncondors, butterflies like giant fowl, and the simplest objects of the\nforest like the imaginations of a disordered dream.  Behind that gauzy\nhallucination a fine white mist came up, and the sun spread out flat\nand red in the sky, while the pent-in heat became almost unendurable.\n\nStill I plodded on, growling to myself that in Christian latitudes all\nthe evidences would have been held to betoken a storm before night,\nwhatever they might do here, but for the most part lost in my own\ngloomy speculations.  That was the more pity since, in thinking the\nwalk over now, it seems to me that I passed many marvels, saw many\nglorious vistas in those nameless forests, many spreads of colour, many\nincidents that, could I but remember them more distinctly, would supply\nmaterial for making my fortune as a descriptive traveller.  But what\nwould you? I have forgotten, and am too virtuous to draw on my\nimagination, as it is sometimes said other travellers have done when\npicturesque facts were deficient.  Yes, I have forgotten all about that\nday, save that it was sultry hot, that I took off my coat and waistcoat\nto be cooler, carrying them, like the tramp I was, across my arm, and\nthus dishevelled passed some time in the afternoon an encampment of\nforest folk, wherefrom almost all the men were gone, and the women shy\nand surly.\n\nIn no very social humour myself, I walked round their woodland village,\nand on the outskirts, by a brook, just as I was wishing there were some\none to eat my solitary lunch with, chanced upon a fellow busily engaged\nin hammering stones into weapons upon a flint anvil.\n\nHe was an ugly-looking individual at best, yet I was hard up for\ncompany, so I put my coat down, and, seating myself on a log opposite,\nproceeded to open my wallet, and take out the frugal stores the woodman\nhad given me that morning.\n\nThe man was seated upon the ground holding a stone anvil between his\nfeet, while with his hands he turned and chipped with great skill a\nspear-head he was making out of flint.  It was about the only pastime\nhe had, and his little yellow eyes gleamed with a craftsman's pleasure,\nhis shaggy round shoulders were bent over the task, the chips flew in\nquick particles, and the wood echoed musically as the artificer watched\nthe thing under his hands take form and fashion.  Presently I spoke,\nand the worker looked up, not too pleased at being thus interrupted.\nBut he was easy of propitiation, and over a handful of dried raisins\ncommunicative.\n\nHow, I asked, knowing a craftsman's craft is often nearest to his\nheart, how was it such things as that he chipped came to be thought of\nby him and his? Whereon the woodman, having spit out the raisin-stones\nand wiped his fingers on his fur, said in substance that the first\nweapon was fashioned when the earliest ape hurled the first stone in\nwrath.\n\n\"But, chum,\" I said, taking up his half-finished spear and touching the\nrazor-fine edge with admiring caution, \"from hurling the crude pebble\nto fashioning such as this is a long stride.  Who first edged and\npointed the primitive malice? What man with the soul of a thousand\nunborn fighters in him notched and sharpened your natural rock?\"\n\nWhereon the chipper grinned, and answered that, when the woodmen had\nfound stones that would crack skulls, it came upon them presently that\nthey would crack nuts as well.  And cracking nuts between two stones\none day a flint shattered, and there on the grass was the golden secret\nof the edge--the thing that has made man what he is.\n\n\"Yet again, good fellow,\" I queried, \"even this happy chance only gives\nus a weapon, sharp, no doubt, and calculated to do a hundred services\nfor any ten the original pebble could have done, but still unhandled,\nsmall in force, imperfect--now tell me, which of your amiable ancestors\nfirst put a handle to the fashioned flint, and how he thought of it?\"\n\nThe workman had done his flake by now, and wrapping it in a bit of\nskin, put it carefully in his belt before turning to answer my question.\n\n\"Who made the first handle for the first flint, you of the many\nquestions? She did--she, the Mother,\" he suddenly cried, patting the\nearth with his brown hand, and working himself up as he spoke, \"made it\nin her heart for us her first-born.  See, here is such as the first\nhandled weapon that ever came out of darkness,\" and he snatched from\nthe ground, where it had lain hidden under his fox-skin cloak, a heavy\nclub. I saw in an instant how it was.  The club had been a sapling, and\nthe sapling's roots had grown about and circled with a splendid grip a\nlump of native flint.  A woodman had pulled the sapling, found the\nflint, and fashioned the two in a moment of happy inspiration, the one\nto an axe-head and the other to a handle, as they lay Nature-welded!\n\n\"This, I say, is the first--the first!\" screamed the old fellow as\nthough I were contradicting him, thumping the ground with his weapon,\nand working himself up to a fury as its black magic entered his being.\n\"This is the first: with this I slew Hetter and Gur, and those who\nplundered my hiding-places in the woods; with this I have killed a\nscore of others, bursting their heads, and cracking their bones like\ndry sticks. With this--with this--\" but here his rage rendered him\ninarticulate; he stammered and stuttered for a minute, and then as the\nkilling fury settled on him his yellow teeth shut with a sudden snap,\nwhile through them his breath rattled like wind through dead pine\nbranches in December, the sinews sat up on his hands as his fingers\ntightened upon the axe-heft like the roots of the same pines from the\nground when winter rain has washed the soil from beneath them; his\nsmall eyes gleamed like baleful planets; every hair upon his shaggy\nback grew stiff and erect--another minute and my span were ended.\n\nWith a leap from where I sat I flew at that hairy beast, and sinking my\nfists deep in his throttle, shook him till his eyes blazed with\ndelirious fires.  We waltzed across the short greensward, and in and\nabout the tree-trunks, shaking, pulling, and hitting as we went, till\nat last I felt the man's vigour dying within him; a little more\nshaking, a sudden twist, and he was lying on the ground before me,\nsenseless and civil!  That is the worst of some orators, I thought to\nmyself, as I gloomily gathered up the scattered fragments of my lunch;\nthey never know when they have said enough, and are too apt to be\ncarried away by their own arguments.\n\nThat inhospitable village was left behind in full belief the mountain\nlooming in the south could be reached before nightfall, while the road\nto its left would serve as a sure guide to food and shelter for the\nevening.  But, as it turned out, the morning's haze developed a strong\nmist ere the afternoon was half gone, through which it was impossible\nto see more than twenty yards.  My hill loomed gigantic for a time with\na tantalising appearance of being only a mile or two ahead, then\nwavered, became visionary, and finally disappeared as completely as\nthough the forest mist had drunk it up bodily.\n\nThere was still the road to guide me, a fairly well-beaten track\ntwining through the glades; but even the best of highways are difficult\nin fog, and this one was complicated by various side paths, made\nprobably by hunters or bark-cutters, and without compass or guide marks\nit was necessary to advance with extreme caution, or get helplessly\nmazed.\n\nAn hour's steady tramping brought me nowhere in particular, and\nstopping for a minute to consider, I picked a few wild fruit, such as\nmy wood-cutter friend had eaten, from an overhanging bush, and in so\ndoing slipped, the soil having now become damp, and in falling broke a\nbranch off.  The incident was only important from what follows. Picking\nmyself up, perhaps a little shaken by the jolt, I set off again upon\nwhat seemed the plain road, and being by this time displeased by my\nsurroundings, determined to make a push for \"civilization\" before the\nrapidly gathering darkness settled down.\n\nHands in pockets and collar up, I marched forward at a good round pace\nfor an hour, constantly straining eyes for a sight of the hill and ears\nfor some indications of living beings in the deathly hush of the\nshrouded woods, and at the end of that time, feeling sure habitations\nmust now be near, arrived at what looked like a little open space,\nsomehow seeming rather familiar in its vague outlines.\n\nWhere had I seen such a place before? Sauntering round the margin, a\nbush with a broken branch suddenly attracted my attention--a broken\nbush with a long slide in the mud below it, and the stamp of Navy boots\nin the soft turf!  I glared at those signs for a moment, then with an\nexclamation of chagrin recognised them only too well--it was the bush\nwhence I had picked the fruit, and the mark of my fall.  An hour's hard\nwalking round some accursed woodland track had brought me exactly back\nto the point I had started from--I was lost!\n\nIt really seemed to get twenty per cent darker as I made that\nabominable discovery, and the position dawned in all its uncomfortable\nintensity. There was nothing for it but to start off again, this time\njudging my direction only by a light breath of air drifting the mist\ntangles before it; and therein I made a great mistake, for the breeze\nhad shifted several points from the quarter whence it blew in the\nmorning.\n\nKnowing nothing of this, I went forward with as much lightheartedness\nas could be managed, humming a song to myself, and carefully putting\naside thoughts of warmth and supper, while the dusk increased and the\ngreat forest vegetation seemed to grow ranker and closer at every step.\n\nAnother disconcerting thing was that the ground sloped gradually\ndownwards, not upwards as it should have done, till it seemed the path\nlay across the flats of a forest-covered plain, which did not conform\nto my wish of striking a road on the foot-hills of the mountain.\nHowever, I plodded on, drawing some small comfort from the fact that as\ndarkness came the mist rose from the ground and appeared to condense in\na ghostly curtain twenty feet overhead, where it hung between me and a\nclear night sky, presently illumined by starlight with the strangest\neffect.\n\nTired, footsore, and dejected, I struggled on a little further.  Oh for\na cab, I laughed bitterly to myself.  Oh for even the humble necessary\nomnibus of civilisation.  Oh for the humblest tuck-shop where a mug of\nhot coffee and a snack could be had by a homeless wanderer; and as I\nthought and plodded savagely on, collar up, hands in pockets, through\nthe black tangles of that endless wood, suddenly the sound of wailing\nchildren caught my ear!\n\nIt was the softest, saddest music ever mortal listened to.  It was as\nthough scores of babes in pain were dropping to sleep on their mothers'\nbreasts, and all hushing their sorrows with one accord in a common\nmelancholy chorus.  I stood spell-bound at that elfin wailing, the\nfirst sound to break the deathly stillness of the road for an hour or\nmore, and my blood tingled as I listened to it.  Nevertheless, here was\nwhat I was looking for; where there were weeping children there must be\nhabitations, and shelter, and--splendid thought!--supper.  Poor little\nbabes! their crying was the deadliest, sweetest thing in sorrows I ever\nlistened to. If it was cholic--why, I knew a little of medicine, and in\ngratitude for that prospective supper, I had a soul big enough to cure\na thousand; and if they were in disgrace, and by some quaint Martian\nfashion had suffered simultaneous punishment for baby offences, I would\nplead for them.\n\nIn fact, I fairly set off at the run towards the sobbing, in the black,\nwet, night air ahead, and, tripping as I ran, looked down and saw in\nthe filtering starlight that the forest grass had given place to an\nancient roadway, paved with moss-grown flag-stones, such as they still\nused in Seth.\n\nWithout stopping to think what that might mean I hurried on, the\nwailing now right ahead, a tremulous tumult of gentle grief rising and\nfalling on the night air like the sound of a sea after a storm; and so,\npresently, in a minute or two, came upon a ruined archway spanning the\nlonely road, held together by great masses of black-fingered creepers,\ngaunt and ghostly in the shadows, an extraordinary and unexpected\nvision; and as I stopped with a jerk under that forbidding gateway and\nglared at its tumbled masonry and great portals hanging rotten at their\nhinges, suddenly the truth flashed upon me.  I had taken the forbidden\nroad after all.  I was in the ancient, ghost-haunted city of Queen Yang!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe dark forest seemed to shut behind as I entered the gateway of the\ndeserted Hither town, against which my wood-cutter friend had warned\nme, while inside the soft mist hung in the starlight like grey drapery\nover endless vistas of ruins.  What was I to do? Without all was black\nand cheerless, inside there was at least shelter.  Wet and cold, my\ncourage was not to be put down by the stories of a silly savage; I\nwould go on whatever happened.  Besides, the soft sound of crying, now\napparently all about, seemed companionable, and I had heard so much of\nghosts of late, the sharp edge of fear at their presence was wearing\noff.\n\nSo in I went: up a broad, decayed street, its flagstones heaved\neverywhere by the roots of gnarled trees, and finding nothing save\nruin, tried to rest under a wall.  But the night air was chilly and the\nshelter poor, so out I came again, with the wailing in the shadows so\nclose about now that I stopped, and mustering up courage called aloud:\n\n\"Hullo, you who weep there in the dark, are you living or dead?\" And\nafter a minute from the hollows of the empty hearths around came the\nsad little responsive echo:\n\n\"Are you living or dead?\"  It was very delusive and unsatisfactory, and\nI was wondering what to do next when a slant of warmer wind came up\nbehind me under the mist, and immediately little tongues of blue flame\nblossomed without visible cause in every darksome crevice; pale\nflickers of miasmic light rising pallid from every lurking nook and\ncorner in the black desolation as though a thousand lamps were lit by\nunseen fingers, and, knee high, floated out into the thoroughfare where\nthey oscillated gently in airy grace, and then, forming into\nprocession, began drifting before the tepid air towards the city\ncentre.  At once I thought of what the woodcutter had seen, but was too\nwet and sulky by this time to care. The fascination of the place was on\nme, and dropping into rear of the march, I went forward with it.  By\nthis time the wailing had stopped, though now and then it seemed a dark\nform moved in the empty doorways on either hand, while the mist,\nparting into gossamers before the wind, took marvellously human forms\nin every alley and lane we passed.\n\nThus I, a sodden giant, led by those elfin torches, paced through the\ncity until we came to an open square with a great lumber of ruins in\nthe centre all marred and spoiled by vegetation; and here the lights\nwavered, and went out by scores and hundreds, just as the petals drop\nfrom spent flowers, while it seemed, though it may have been only wind\nin the rank grass, that the air was full of most plaintive sighs as\neach little lamp slipped into oblivion.\n\nThe big pile was a mass of fallen masonry, which, from the broken\npillars all about, might have been a palace or temple once.  I pushed\nin, but it was as dark as Hades here, so, after struggling for a time\nin a labyrinth of chambers, chose a sandy recess, with some dry herbage\nby way of bedding in a corner, and there, thankful at least for\nshelter, my night's wanderings came to an end and I coiled myself down,\nate a last handful of dry fruit, and, strange as it may seem, was soon\nsleeping peacefully.\n\nI dreamed that night that a woman, with a face as white as ivory, came\nand bent over me.  She led a babe by either hand, while behind her were\nscores of other ones, with lovely faces, but all as pale as the stars\nthemselves, who looked and sighed, but said nothing, and when they had\nstared their fill, dropped out one by one, leaving a wonderful blank in\nthe monotony where they had been; but beyond that dream nothing\nhappened.\n\nIt was a fine morning when I woke again, and obviously broad day\noutside, the sunshine coming down through cracks in the old palace\nroof, and lying in golden pools on the floor with dazzling effect.\n\nRubbing my eyes and sitting up, it took me some time to get my senses\ntogether, and at first an uneasy feeling possessed me that I was\nsomehow dematerialised and in an unreal world.  But a twinge of cramp\nin my left arm, and a healthy sneeze, which frightened a score of bats\noverhead nearly out of their senses, was reassuring on this point, and\nrubbing away the cramp and staggering to my feet, I looked about at the\nstrange surroundings.  It was cavernous chaos on every side:\nmagnificent architecture reduced to the confusion of a debris-heap,\nonly the hollow chambers being here and there preserved by massive\ncolumns meeting overhead.  Into these the yellow light filtered\nwherever a rent in a cupola or side-wall admitted it, and allured by\nthe vision of corridors one beyond the other, I presently set off on a\ntour of discovery.\n\nTwenty minutes' scrambling brought me to a place where the fallen jambs\nof a fine doorway lay so close together that there was barely room to\npass between them.  However, seeing light beyond, I squeezed through,\nand I found myself in the best-preserved chamber of all--a wide, roomy\nhall with a domed roof, a haze of mural paintings on the walls, and a\nmarble floor nearly hidden in a century of fallen dust. I stumbled over\nsomething at the threshold, and picking it up, found it was a baby's\nskull!  And there were more of them now that my eyes became accustomed\nto the light.  The whole floor was mottled with them--scores and\nhundreds of bones and those poor little relics of humanity jutting out\nof the sand everywhere.  In the hush of that great dead nursery the\nlittle white trophies seemed inexpressibly pathetic, and I should have\nturned back reverently from that chamber of forgotten sorrows but that\nsomething caught my eye in the centre of it.\n\nIt was an oblong pile of white stone, very ill-used and chipped,\nwrist-deep in dust, yet when a slant of light came in from above and\nfell straight upon it, the marble against the black gloom beyond blazed\nlike living pearl.  It was dazzling; and shading my eyes and going\ntenderly over through the poor dead babes, I looked, and there, full in\nthe shine, lay a woman's skeleton, still wrapped in a robe of which\nlittle was left save the hard gold embroidery.  Her brown hair,\nwonderful to say, still lay like lank, dead seaweed about her, and\namongst it was a fillet crown of plain iron set with gems such as eye\nnever looked upon before. There were not many, but enough to make the\nproud simplicity of that circlet glisten like a little band of fire--a\ngleaming halo on her dead forehead infinitely fascinating.  At her\nsides were two other little bleached human flowers, and I stood before\nthem for a long time in silent sympathy.\n\nCould this be Queen Yang, of whom the woodcutter had told me? It must\nbe--who else? And if it were, what strange chance had brought me\nhere--a stranger, yet the first to come, since her sorrow, from her\ndistant kindred? And if it were, then that fillet belonged of right to\nHeru, the last representative of her kind.  Ought I not to take it to\nher rather than leave it as spoil to the first idle thief with pluck\nenough to deride the mysteries of the haunted city? Long time I thought\nover it in the faint, heavy atmosphere of that hall, and then very\ngently unwound the hair, lifted the circlet, and, scarcely knowing what\nI did, put it in my shoulder-bag.\n\nAfter that I went more cheerfully into the outside sunshine, and\nsetting my clothes to dry on a stone, took stock of the situation. The\nplace was, perhaps, not quite so romantic by day as by night, and the\nscattered trees, matted by creepers, with which the whole were\novergrown, prevented anything like an extensive view of the ruined city\nbeing obtained.  But what gave me great satisfaction was to note over\nthese trees to the eastward a two-humped mountain, not more than six or\nseven miles distant--the very one I had mislaid the day before. Here\nwas reality and a chance of getting back to civilisation.  I was as\nglad as if home were in sight, and not, perhaps, the less so because\nthe hill meant villages and food; and you who have doubtless lunched\nwell and lately will please bear in mind I had had nothing since\nbreakfast the day before; and though this may look picturesque on\npaper, in practice it is a painful item in one's programme.\n\nWell, I gave my damp clothes but a turn or two more in the sun, and\nthen, arguing that from the bare ground where the forest ended half-way\nup the hill, a wide view would be obtained, hurried into my garments\nand set off thither right gleefully.  A turn or two down the blank\nstreets, now prosaic enough, an easy scramble through a gap in the\ncrumbling battlements, and there was the open forest again, with a\nfriendly path well marked by the passage of those wild animals who made\nthe city their lair trending towards my landmark.\n\nA light breakfast of soft green nuts, plucked on the way, and then the\nground began to bend upwards and the woods to thin a little. With\ninfinite ardour, just before midday, I scrambled on to a bare knoll on\nthe very hillside, and fell exhausted before the top could be reached.\n\nBut what were hunger or fatigue to the satisfaction of that moment?\nThere was the sea before me, the clear, strong, gracious sea, blue\nleagues of it, furrowed by the white ridges of some distant storm.  I\ncould smell the scent of it even here, and my sailor heart rose in\npride at the companionship of that alien ocean.  Lovely and blessed\nthing! how often have I turned from the shallow trivialities of the\nland and found consolation in the strength of your stately solitudes!\nHow often have I turned from the tinselled presence of the shore, the\ninfinite pretensions of dry land that make life a sorry, hectic sham,\nand found in the black bosom of the Great Mother solace and comfort!\nDear, lovely sea, man--half of every sphere, as far removed in the\nsequence of your strong emotions from the painted fripperies of the\nwoman-land as pole from pole--the grateful blessing of the humblest of\nyour followers on you!\n\nThe mere sight of salt water did me good.  Heaven knows our separation\nhad not been long, and many an unkind slap has the Mother given me in\nthe bygone; yet the mere sight of her was tonic, a lethe of troubles, a\nsedative for tired nerves; and I gazed that morning at the illimitable\nblue, the great, unfettered road to everywhere, the ever-varied, the\nimmutable, the thing which was before everything and shall be last of\nall, in an ecstasy of affection.\n\nThere was also other satisfaction at hand.  Not a mile away lay a\nwell-defined road--doubtless the one spoken of by the wood-cutter--and\nwhere the track pointed to the seashore the low roofs and circling\nsmoke of a Thither township showed.\n\nThere I went hot-footed, and, much too hungry to be nice in formality,\nswung up to the largest building on the waterside quay and demanded\nbreakfast of the man who was lounging by its doorway chewing a honey\nreed. He looked me up and down without emotion, then, falling into the\ncommon mistake, said,\n\n\"This is not a hostel for ghosts, sir.  We do not board and lodge\nphantoms here; this is a dry fish shop.\"\n\n\"Thrice blessed trade!\" I answered.  \"Give me some dried fish, good\nfellow, or, for the matter of that, dried horse or dog, or anything\nmortal teeth can bite through, and I will show you my tastes are\naltogether mundane.\"\n\nBut he shook his head.  \"This is no place for the likes of you, who\ncome, mayhap, from the city of Yang or some other abode of disembodied\nspirits--you, who come for mischief and pay harbourage with\nmischance--is it likely you could eat wholesome food?\"\n\n\"Indeed I could, and plenty of it, seeing I have dined and breakfasted\nalong the hedges with the blackbirds this two days.  Look here, I will\npay in advance.  Will that get me a meal?\" and, whipping out my knife,\ncut off another of my fast-receding coat buttons.\n\nThe man took it with great interest, as I hoped he would, the yellow\nmetal being apparently a very scarce commodity in his part of the\nplanet.\n\n\"Gold?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well--ahem!  I forgot to ask the man who sewed them on for me what\nthey were exactly, but it looks like gold, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, turning it to and fro admiringly in his hand, \"you\nare the first ghost I ever knew to pay in advance, and plenty of them\ngo to and fro through here.  Such a pretty thing is well worth a\nmeal--if, indeed, you can stomach our rough fare.  Here, you woman\nwithin,\" he called to the lady whom I presume was his wife, \"here is a\ngentleman from the nether regions who wants some breakfast and has paid\nin advance. Give him some of your best, for he has paid well.\"\n\n\"And what,\" said a female voice from inside, \"what if I refused to\nserve another of these plaguy wanderers you are always foisting upon\nme?\"\n\n\"Don't mind her tongue, sir.  It's the worst part of her, though she is\nmighty proud of it.  Go in and she will see you do not come out\nhungry,\" and the Thither man returned calmly to his honey stick.\n\n\"Come on, you Soul-with-a-man's-stomach,\" growled the woman, and too\nhungry to be particular about the tone of invitation, I strode into the\nparlour of that strange refreshment place.  The woman was the first I\nhad seen of the outer race, and better than might have been expected in\nappearance.  Big, strong, and ruddy, she was a mental shock after the\nslender slips of girlhood on the far side of the water, half a dozen of\nwhom she could have carried off without effort in her long arms. Yet\nthere was about her the credential of rough health, the dignity of\nmuscle, an upright carriage, an animal grace of movement, and withal a\ncomely though strongly featured face, which pleased me at once, and\nlater on I had great cause to remember her with gratitude.  She eyed me\nsulkily for a minute, then her frown gradually softened, and the\ninstinctive love of the woman for the supernatural mastered her other\nfeelings.\n\n\"Is that how you looked in another world?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, exactly, cap to boots.  What do you think of the attire, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" replied the good woman frankly.  \"It could not have been\nbecoming even when new, and you appear as though you had taken a muddy\nroad since then.  What did you die of?\"\n\n\"I will tell you so much as this, madam--that what I am like to die of\nnow is hunger, plain, unvarnished hunger, so, in Heaven's name, get out\nwhat you have and let me fall-to, for my last meal was yesterday\nmorning.\"\n\nWhereat, with a shrug of her shoulders at the eccentricities of nether\nfolk, the woman went to the rear of the house, and presently came back\nwith a meal which showed her husband had done scant justice to the\nestablishment by calling it a dry fish shop.  It is true, fish supplied\nthe staple of the repast, as was inevitable in a seaport, but, like all\nMartian fish, it was of ambrosial kind, with a savour about it of wine\nand sunshine such as no fish on our side of space can boast of. Then\nthere were cakes, steaming and hot, vegetables which fitted into the\nprevious course with exquisite nicety, and, lastly, a wooden tankard of\nthe invariable Thither beer to finish off.  Such a meal as a hungry man\nmight consider himself fortunate to meet with any day.\n\nThe woman watched me eat with much satisfaction, and when I had\nanswered a score of artless questions about my previous state, or\npresent condition and prospects, more or less to her satisfaction, she\nsupplied me in turn with some information which was really valuable to\nme just then.\n\nFirst I learned that Ar-hap's men, with the abducted Heru, had passed\nthrough this very port two days before, and by this time were probably\nin the main town, which, it appeared, was only about twelve hours'\nrowing up the salt-water estuary outside.  Here was news!  Heru, the\nprize and object of my wild adventure, close at hand and well.  It\nbrought a whole new train of thoughts, for the last few days had been\nso full of the stress of travel, the bare, hard necessity of getting\nforward, that the object of my quest, illogical as it may seem, had\ngone into the background before these things.  And here again, as I\nfinished the last cake and drank down to the bottom of the ale tankard,\nthe extreme folly of the venture came upon me, the madness of venturing\nsingle-handed into the den of the Wood King.  What had I to hope for?\nWhat chance, however remote, was there of successfully wresting that\nblooming prize from the arms of her captor? Force was out of the\nquestion; stealth was utterly impractical; as for cajolery, apparently\nthe sole remaining means of winning back the Princess--why, one might\nas well try the persuasion of a penny flute upon a hungry eagle as seek\nto rouse Ar-hap's sympathies for bereaved Hath in that way.  Surely to\ngo forward would mean my own certain destruction, with no advantage, no\nhelp to Heru; and if I was ever to turn back or stop in the idle quest,\nhere was the place and time. My Hither friends were behind the sea; to\nthem I could return before it was too late, and here were the rough but\nhonest Thither folk, who would doubtless let me live amongst them if\nthat was to be my fate. One or other alternative were better than going\nto torture and death.\n\n\"You seem to take the fate of that Hither girl of yours mightily to\nheart, stranger,\" quoth my hostess, with a touch of feminine jealousy,\nas she watched my hesitation.  \"Do you know anything of her?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered gloomily.  \"I have seen her once or twice away in\nSeth.\"\n\n\"Ah, that reminds me!  When they brought her up here from the boats to\ndry her wet clothes, she cried and called in her grief for just such a\none as you, saying he alone who struck down our men at her feast could\nrescue her--\"\n\n\"What!  Heru here in this room but yesterday!  How did she look? Was\nshe hurt? How had they treated her?\"\n\nMy eagerness gave me away.  The woman looked at me through her\nhalf-shut eyes a space, and then said, \"Oh! sits the wind in THAT\nquarter? So you can love as well as eat.  I must say you are\nwell-conditioned for a spirit.\"\n\nI got up and walked about the room a space, then, feeling very\nfriendless, and knowing no woman was ever born who was not interested\nin another woman's loves, I boldly drew my hostess aside and told her\nabout Heru, and that I was in pursuit of her, dwelling on the girl's\ngentle helplessness, my own hare-brained adventure, and frankly asking\nwhat sort of a sovereign Ar-hap was, what the customs of his court\nmight be, and whether she could suggest any means, temporal or\nspiritual, by which he might be moved to give back Heru to her kindred.\n\nNor was my confidence misplaced.  The woman, as I guessed, was touched\nsomewhere back in her female heart by my melting love-tale, by my\nanxiety and Heru's peril.  Besides, a ghost in search of a fairy\nlady--and such the slender folk of Seth were still considered to be by\nthe race which had supplanted them--this was romance indeed.  To be\nbrief, that good woman proved invaluable.\n\nShe told me, firstly, that Ar-hap was believed to be away at war,\n\"weekending\" as was his custom, amongst rebellious tribes, and by\nstarting at once up the water, I should very probably get to the town\nbefore he did.  Secondly, she thought if I kept clear of private brawls\nthere was little chance of my receiving injury, from the people at all\nevents, as they were accustomed to strange visitors, and civil enough\nuntil they were fired by war.  \"Sickle cold, sword hot,\" was one of\ntheir proverbs, meaning thereby that in peaceful times they were lambs,\nhowever lionlike they might be in contest.\n\nThis was reassuring, but as to recovering the lady, that was another\nmatter over which the good woman shook her head.  It was ill coming\nbetween Ar-hap and his tribute, she said; still, if I wanted to see\nHeru once again, this was my opportunity, and, for the rest, that\nchance, which often favours the enamoured, must be my help.\n\nBriefly, though I should probably have gone forward in any case out of\nsheer obstinacy, had it been to certain destruction, this better aspect\nof the situation hastened my resolution.  I thanked the woman for help,\nand then the man outside was called in to advise as to the best and\nspeediest way of getting within earshot of his hairy sovereignty, the\nmonarch of Thitherland.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nThe Martian told me of a merchant boat with ten rowers which was going\nup to the capital in a couple of hours, and as the skipper was a friend\nof his they would no doubt take me as supercargo, thereby saving the\nnecessity of passenger fees, which was obviously a consideration with\nme. It was not altogether a romantic approach to the dungeon of an\nimprisoned beauty, but it was practical, which is often better if not\nso pleasant. So the offer was gladly closed with, and curling myself in\na rug of foxskins, for I was tired with much walking, sailors never\nbeing good foot-gangers, I slept soundly fill they came to tell me it\nwas time to go on board.\n\nThe vessel was more like a canal barge than anything else, lean and\nlong, with the cargo piled in a ridge down the centre as farmers store\ntheir winter turnips, the rowers sitting on either side of this plying\noars like dessert-spoons with long handles, while they chanted a\nmonotonous cadence of monosyllables:\n\n  Oh, ho, oh,\n  Oh, ho, oh,\n    How high, how high.\n\nand then again after a pause--\n\n    How high, how high\n  Oh, ho, oh,\n  Oh, ho, oh.\n\nthe which was infinitely sleep-provoking if not a refrain of a high\nintellectual order.\n\nI shut my eyes as we pulled away from the wharfs of that nameless\nemporium and picked a passage through a crowd of quaint shipping,\nwondering where I was, and asking myself whether I was mentally rising\nequal to my extraordinary surroundings, whether I adequately\nappreciated the immensity of my remove from those other seas on which I\nhad last travelled, tiller-ropes in hand, piloting a captain's galley\nfrom a wharf. Good heavens, what would my comrades on my ship say if\nthey could see me now steering a load of hairy savages up one of those\nwaterways which our biggest telescopes magnify but to the thickness of\nan indication? No, I was not rising equal to the occasion, and could\nnot.  The human mind is of but limited capacity after all, and such\nfreaks of fortune are beyond its conception.  I knew I was where I was,\nbut I knew I should probably never get the chance of telling of it, and\nthat no one would ever believe me if I did, and I resigned myself to\nthe inevitable with sullen acquiescence, smothering the wonder that\nmight have been overwhelming in passing interests of the moment.\n\nThere is little to record of that voyage.  We passed through a fleet of\nAr-hap's warships, empty and at anchor in double line, serviceable\nhalf-decked cutters, built of solid timber, not pumpkin rind it was\npleasant to notice, and then the town dropped away as we proceeded up a\nstream about as broad as the Hudson at its widest, and profusely\nstudded with islands.  This water was bitterly salt and joined another\nsea on the other side of the Martian continent.  Yet it had a\npronounced flow against us eastward, this tide running for three spring\nmonths and being followed, I learned, as ocean temperatures varied, by\na flow in the opposite direction throughout the summer.\n\nJust at present the current was so strong eastwards, the moisture\nbeaded upon my rowers' tawny hides as they struggled against it, and\ntheir melancholy song dawdled in \"linked sweetness long drawn out,\"\nwhile the swing of their oars grew longer and longer.  Truly it was\nvery hot, far hotter than was usual for the season, these men declared,\nand possibly this robbed me of my wonted energy, and you, gentle\nreader, of a description of all the strange things we passed upon that\nhighway.\n\nSuffice it to say we spent a scorching afternoon, the greater part of a\nstifling night moored under a mud-bank with a grove of trees on top\nfrom which gigantic fire-flies hung as though the place were\nilluminated for a garden fete, and then, rowing on again in the\ncomparatively cool hours before dawn, turned into a backwater at\ncock-crow.\n\nThe skipper of our cargo boat roused me just as we turned, putting\nunder my sleepy nostrils a handful of toasted beans on a leaf, and a\nsmall cup full of something that was not coffee, but smelt as good as\nthat matutinal beverage always does to the tired traveller.\n\nOver our prow was an immense arch of foliage, and underneath a long\narcade of cool black shadows, sheltering still water, till water and\nshadow suddenly ended a quarter of a mile down in a patch of brilliant\ncolour. It was as peaceful as could be in the first morning light, and\nto me over all there was the inexpressible attraction of the unknown.\n\nAs our boat slipped silently forward up this leafy lane, a thin white\n\"feather\" in her mouth alone breaking the steely surface of the stream,\nthe men rested from their work and began, as sailors will, to put on\ntheir shore-going clothes, the while they chatted in low tones over the\nprofits of the voyage.  Overhead flying squirrels were flitting to and\nfro like bats, or shelling fruit whereof the husks fell with a pleasant\nsplash about us, and on one bank a couple of early mothers were washing\ntheir babies, whose smothered protests were almost the only sound in\nthis morning world.\n\nAnother silent dip or two of the oars and the colour ahead crystallised\ninto a town.  If I said it was like an African village on a large\nscale, I should probably give you the best description in the fewest\nwords. From the very water's edge up to the crown of a low hill inland,\nextended a mass of huts and wooden buildings, embowered and partly\nhidden in bright green foliage, with here and there patches of millet,\nor some such food plant, and the flowers that grow everywhere so\nabundantly in this country.  It was all Arcadian and peaceful enough at\nthe moment, and as we drew near the men were just coming out to the\nquays along the harbour front, the streets filling and the town waking\nto busy life.\n\nA turn to the left through a watergate defended by towers of wood and\nmud, and we were in the city harbour itself; boats of many kinds moored\non every side; quaint craft from the gulfs and bays of Nowhere, full of\nunheard-of merchandise, and manned by strange-faced crews, every vessel\na romance of nameless seas, an epitome of an undiscovered world, and\nevery moment the scene grew busier as the breakfast smoke arose, and\nwharf and gangway set to work upon the day's labours.\n\nOur boat--loaded, as it turned out, with spoil from Seth--was run to a\nplace of honour at the bottom of the town square, and was an object of\nmuch curiosity to a small crowd which speedily collected and lent a\nhand with the mooring ropes, the while chatting excitedly with the crew\nabout further tribute and the latest news from overseas.  At the same\ntime a swarthy barbarian, whose trappings showed him to be some sort of\nfunctionary, came down to our \"captain,\" much wagging of heads and\ncounting of notched sticks taking place between them.\n\nI, indeed, was apparently the least interesting item of the cargo, and\nthis was embarrassing.  No hero likes to be neglected, it is fatal to\nhis part.  I had said my prayers and steeled myself to all sorts of\nfine endurance on the way up, and here, when it came to the crisis, no\none was anxious to play the necessary villain.  They just helped me\nashore civilly enough, the captain nodded his head at me, muttering\nsomething in an indifferent tone to the functionary about a ghost who\nhad wandered overseas and begged a passage up the canal; the group\nabout the quay stared a little, but that was all.\n\nOnce I remember seeing a squatting, life-size heathen idol hoisted from\na vessel's hold and deposited on a sugar-box on a New York quay. Some\nribald passer-by put a battered felt hat upon Vishnu's sacred curls,\nand there the poor image sat, an alien in an indifferent land, a sack\nacross its shoulders, a \"billycock\" upon its head, and honoured at most\nwith a passing stare.  I thought of that lonely image as almost as\nlonely I stood on the Thither men's quay, without the support of\nfriends or heroics, wondering what to do next.\n\nHowever, a cheerful disposition is sometimes better than a banking\naccount, and not having the one I cultivated the other, sunning myself\namongst the bales for a time, and then, since none seemed interested in\nme, wandered off into the town, partly to satisfy my curiosity, and\npartly in the vague hope of ascertaining if my princess was really\nhere, and, if possible, getting sight of her.\n\nMeanwhile it turned hot with a supernatural, heavy sort of heat\naltogether, I overheard passersby exclaiming, out of the common, and\nafter wandering for an hour through gardens and endless streets of\nthatched huts, I was glad enough to throw myself down in the shadow of\nsome trees on the outskirts of the great central pile of buildings, a\nwhole village in itself of beam-built towers and dwelling-place,\nsuggesting by its superior size that it might actually be Ar-hap's\npalace.\n\nHotter and hotter it grew, while a curious secondary sunrise in the\nwest, the like of which I never saw before seemed to add to the heat,\nand heavier and heavier my eyelids, till I dozed at last, and finally\nslept uncomfortably for a time.\n\nRousing up suddenly, imagine my surprise to see sitting, chin on knees,\nabout a yard away, a slender girlish figure, infinitely out of place in\nthat world of rough barbarians.  Was it possible?  Was I dreaming? No,\nthere was no doubt about it, she was a girl of the Hither folk, slim\nand pretty, but with a wonderfully sad look in her gazelle eyes, and\nscarcely a sign of the indolent happiness of Seth in the pale little\nface regarding me so fixedly.\n\n\"Good gracious, miss,\" I said, still rubbing my eyes and doubting my\nsenses, \"have you dropped from the skies?  You are the very last person\nI expected to see in this barbarian place.\"\n\n\"And you too, sir.  Oh, it is lovely to see one so newly from home, and\nfree-seeming--not a slave.\"\n\n\"How did you know I was from Seth?\"\n\n\"Oh, that was easy enough,\" and with a little laugh she pointed to a\npebble lying between us, on which was a piece of battered sweetmeat in\na perforated bamboo box.  Poor An had given me something just like that\nin a playful mood, and I had kept it in my pocket for her sake, being,\nas you will have doubtless observed, a sentimental young man, and now I\nclapped my hand where it should have been, but it was gone.\n\n\"Yes,\" said my new friend, \"that is yours.  I smelt the sweetmeat\ncoming up the hill, and crossed the grass until I found you here\nasleep. Oh, it was lovely!  I took it from your pocket, and white Seth\nrose up before my swimming eyes, even at the scent of it.  I am Si,\nwell named, for that in our land means sadness, Si, the daughter of\nPrince Hath's chief sweetmeat-maker, so I should know something of such\nstuff.  May I, please, nibble a little piece?\"\n\n\"Eat it all, my lass, and welcome.  How came you here?  But I can\nguess. Do not answer if you would rather not.\"\n\n\"Ay, but I will.  It is not every day I can speak to ears so friendly\nas yours.  I am a slave, chosen for my luckless beauty as last year's\ntribute to Ar-hap.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"And now the slave of Ar-hap's horse-keeper, set aside to make room for\na fresher face.\"\n\n\"And do you know whose face that is?\"\n\n\"Not I, a hapless maid sent into this land of horrors, to bear ignominy\nand stripes, to eat coarse food and do coarse work, the miserable\nplaything of some brute in semi-human form, with but the one\nconsolation of dying early as we tribute-women always die.  Poor\ncomrade in exile, I only know her as yet by sympathy.\"\n\n\"What if I said it was Heru, the princess?\"\n\nThe Martian girl sprang to her feet, and clasping her hands exclaimed,\n\n\"Heru, the Slender!  Then the end comes, for it is written in our books\nthat the last tribute is paid when the best is paid.  Oh, how splendid\nif she gave herself of free will to this slavery to end it once for\nall. Was it so?\"\n\n\"I think, Si, your princess could not have known of that tradition; she\ndid not come willingly.  Besides, I am come to fetch her back, if it\nmay be, and that spoils the look of sacrifice.\"\n\n\"You to fetch her back, and from Ar-hap's arms?  My word, Sir Spirit,\nyou must know some potent charms; or, what is less likely, my\ncountrymen must have amazingly improved in pluck since I left them.\nHave you a great army at hand?\"\n\nBut I only shook my head, and, touching my sword, said that here was\nthe only army coming to rescue Heru.  Whereon the lady replied that she\nthought my valour did me more honour than my discretion.  How did I\npropose to take the princess from her captors?\n\n\"To tell the truth, damsel, that is a matter which will have to be left\nto your invention, or the kindness of such as you.  I am here on a\nhare-brained errand, playing knight-errant in a way that shocks my\ncommon sense.  But since the matter has gone so far I will see it\nthrough, or die in the attempt.  Your bully lord shall either give me\nHeru, stock, lock, and block, or hang me from a yard-arm.  But I would\nrather have the lady.  Come, you will help me; and, as a beginning, if\nshe is in yonder shanty get me speech with her.\"\n\nPoor Si's eyes dilated at the peril of the suggestion, and I saw the\nsluggish Martian nature at war against her better feelings.  But\npresently the latter conquered.  \"I will try,\" she said.  \"What matter\na few stripes more or less?\" pointing to her rosy shoulders where red\nscars crisscross upon one another showed how the Martian girls fared in\nAr-hap's palace when their novelty wore off.  \"I will try to help you;\nand if they kill me for it--why, that will not matter much.\"  And\nforthwith in that blazing forenoon under the flickering shadow of the\ntrees we put our heads together to see what we might do for Heru.\n\nIt was not much for the moment.  Try what we would that afternoon, I\ncould not persuade those who had charge of the princess to let me even\napproach her place of imprisonment, but Si, as a woman, was more\nsuccessful, actually seeing her for a few moments, and managed to\nwhisper in her ear that I had come, the\nSpirit-with-the-gold-buttons-down-his front, afterwards describing to\nme in flowing Martian imagery--but doubtless not more highly coloured\nthan poor Heru's emotion warranted--how delightedly that lady had\nreceived the news.\n\nSi also did me another service, presenting me to the porter's wife, who\nkept a kind of boarding-house at the gates of Ar-hap's palace for\ngentlemen and ladies with grievances.  I had heard of lobbying before,\nand the presentation of petitions, though I had never indulged myself\nin the pastime; but the crowd of petitioners here, with petitions as\nwild and picturesque as their own motley appearances, was surely the\nstrangest that ever gathered round a seat of supreme authority.\n\nSi whispered in the ear of that good woman the nature of my errand,\nwith doubtless some blandishment of her own; and my errand being one so\nmuch above the vulgar and so nearly touching the sovereign, I was at\nonce accorded a separate room in the gate-house, whence I could look\ndown in comparative peace on the common herd of suitors, and listen to\nthe buzz of their invective as they practised speeches which I\ncalculated it would take Ar-hap all the rest of his reign to listen to,\nwithout allowing him any time for pronouncing verdicts on them.\n\nHere I made myself comfortable, and awaited the return of the sovereign\nas placidly as might be.  Meanwhile fate was playing into my feeble\nhands.\n\nI have said it was hot weather.  At first this seemed but an outcome of\nthe Martian climate, but as the hours went by the heat developed to an\nincredible extent.  Also that red glare previously noted in the west\ngrew in intensity, till, as the hours slipped by, all the town was\nstaring at it in panting horror.  I have seen a prairie on fire,\nluckily from the far side of a comfortably broad river, and have ridden\nthrough a pine-forest when every tree for miles was an uplifted torch,\nand pungent yellow smoke rolled down each corrie side in grey rivers\ncrested with dancing flame. But that Martian glare was more sombre and\nterrible than either.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked of poor Si, who came out gasping to speak to me\nby the gate-house.\n\n\"None of us know, and unless the gods these Thither folk believe in are\nangry, and intend to destroy the world with yonder red sword in the\nsky, I cannot guess.  Perhaps,\" she added, with a sudden flash of\ninspiration, \"it comes by your machinations for Heru's help.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"If not by your wish, then, in the name of all you love, set your wish\nagainst it.  If you know any incantations suitable for the occasion,\noh, practise them now at once, for look, even the very grass is\nwithering; birds are dropping from trees; fishes, horribly bloated, are\nbeginning to float down the steaming rills; and I, with all others,\nhave a nameless dread upon me.\"\n\nHotter and hotter it grew, until about sunset the red blaze upon the\nsky slowly opened, and showed us for about half an hour, through the\nopening a lurid, flame-coloured meteor far out in space beyond; then\nthe cleft closed again, and through that abominable red curtain came\nthe very breath of Hades.\n\nWhat was really happening I am not astronomer enough to say, though on\ncooler consideration I have come to the conclusion that our planet, in\ngoing out to its summer pastures in the remoter fields of space, had\nsomehow come across a wandering lesser world and got pretty well singed\nin passing.  This is purely my own opinion, and I have not yet\nsubmitted it to the kindly authorities of the Lick Observatory for\nverification. All I can say for certain is that in an incredibly short\nspace of time the face of the country changed from green to sear,\nflowers drooped; streams (there were not many in the neighbourhood\napparently) dried up; fishes died; a mighty thirst there was nothing to\nquench settled down on man and beast, and we all felt that unless\nProvidence listened to the prayers and imprecations which the whole\ntown set to work with frantic zeal to hurl at it, or that abominable\ncomet in the sky sheered off on another tack with the least possible\ndelay, we should all be reduced to cinders in a very brief space of\ntime.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nThe evening of the second day had already come, when Ar-hap arrived\nhome after weekending amongst a tribe of rebellious subjects.  But any\nimposing State entry which might have been intended was rendered\nimpossible by the heat and the threat of that baleful world in the\nwestern sky.\n\nIt was a lurid but disordered spectacle which I witnessed from my room\nin the gate-house just after nightfall.  The returning army had\napparently fallen away exhausted on its march through the town; only\nsome three hundred of the bodyguard straggled up the hill, limp and\nsweating, behind a group of pennons, in the midst of which rode a\nhorseman whose commanding presence and splendid war harness impressed\nme, though I could not make out his features; a wild, impressionist\nscene of black outlines, tossing headgear, and spears glittering and\nvanishing in front of the red glare in the sky, but nothing more.  Even\nthe dry throats of the suitors in the courtyard hardly mustered a husky\ncry of welcome as the cavalcade trooped into the enclosure, and then\nthe shadows enfolded them up in silence, and, too hot and listless to\ncare much what the morrow brought forth, I threw myself on the bare\nfloor, tossing and turning in a vain endeavour to sleep until dawn came\nonce more.\n\nA thin mist which fell with daybreak drew a veil over the horrible\nglare in the west for an hour or two, and taking advantage of the\nslight alleviation of heat, I rose and went into the gardens to enjoy a\ndip in a pool, making, with its surrounding jungle of flowers, one of\nthe pleasantest things about the wood-king's forest citadel.  The very\nearth seemed scorched and baking underfoot--and the pool was gone!  It\nhad run as dry as a limekiln; nothing remained of the pretty fall which\nhad fed it but a miserable trickle of drops from the cascade above.\nDown beyond the town shone a gleam of water where the bitter canal\nsteamed and simmered in the first grey of the morning, but up here six\nmonths of scorching drought could not have worked more havoc.  The very\nleaves were dropping from the trees, and the luxuriant growths of the\nday before looked as though a simoon had played upon them.\n\nI staggered back in disgust, and found some show of official activity\nabout the palace.  It was the king's custom, it appeared, to hear\npetitions and redress wrongs as soon after his return as possible, but\ntoday the ceremony was to be cut short as his majesty was going out\nwith all his court to a neighbouring mountain to \"pray away the comet,\"\nwhich by this time was causing dire alarm all through the city.\n\n\"Heaven's own particular blessing on his prayers, my friend,\" I said to\nthe man who told me this.  \"Unless his majesty's orisons are fruitful,\nwe shall all be cooked like baked potatoes before nightfall, and though\nI have faced many kinds of death, that is not the one I would choose by\npreference.  Is there a chance of myself being heard at the throne?\nYour peculiar climate tempts me to hurry up with my business and begone\nif I may.\"\n\n\"Not only may you be heard, sir, but you are summoned.  The king has\nheard of you somehow, and sent me to find and bring you into his\npresence at once.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" I said, too hot to care what happened.  \"I have no levee\ndress with me.  I lost my luggage check some time ago, but if you will\nwait outside I will be with you in a moment.\"\n\nHastily tidying myself up, and giving my hair a comb, as though just\noff to see Mr. Secretary for the Navy, or on the way to get a senator\nto push a new patent medicine for me, I rejoined my guide outside, and\ntogether we crossed the wide courtyard, entered the great log-built\nportals of Ar-hap's house, and immediately afterwards found ourselves\nin a vast hall dimly lit by rays coming in through square spaces under\nthe eaves, and crowded on both sides with guards, courtiers, and\nsupplicants. The heat was tremendous, the odour of Thither men and the\nill-dressed hides they wore almost overpowering.  Yet little I recked\nfor either, for there at the top of the room, seated on a dais made of\nrough-hewn wood inlet with gold and covered with splendid furs, was\nAr-hap himself.\n\nA fine fellow, swarthy, huge, and hairy, at any other time or place I\ncould have given him due admiration as an admirable example of the\nsavage on the borderland of grace and culture, but now I only glanced\nat him, and then to where at his side a girl was crouching, a gem of\nhuman loveliness against that dusky setting.  It was Heru, my ravished\nprincess, and, still clad in her diaphanous Hither robes, her face\nwhite with anxiety, her eyes bright as stars, the embodiment of\nhelpless, flowery beauty, my heart turned over at sight of her.\n\nPoor girl!  When she saw me stride into the hall she rose swiftly from\nAr-hap's side, clasped her pretty hands, and giving a cry of joy would\nhave rushed towards me, but the king laid a mighty paw upon her, under\nwhich she subsided with a shiver as though the touch had blanched all\nthe life within.\n\n\"Good morning, your majesty,\" I said, walking boldly up to the lower\nstep of the dais.\n\n\"Good morning, most singular-looking vagrant from the Unknown,\"\nanswered the monarch.  \"In what way can I be of service to you?''\n\n\"I have come about that girl,\" I said, nodding to where Heru lay\nblossoming in the hot gloom like some night-flowering bud.  \"I do not\nknow whether your majesty is aware how she came here, but it is a\nhighly discreditable incident in what is doubtless your otherwise\nblameless reign.  Some rough scullions intrusted with the duty of\ncollecting your majesty's customs asked Prince Hath of the Hither\npeople to point out the most attractive young person at his wedding\nfeast, and the prince indicated that lady there at your side.  It was a\ndirty trick, and all the worse because it was inspired by malice, which\nis the meanest of all weaknesses.  I had the pleasure of knocking down\nsome of your majesty's representatives, but they stole the girl away\nwhile I slept, and, briefly, I have come to fetch her back.\"\n\nThe monarch had followed my speech, the longest ever made in my life,\nwith fierce, blinking eyes, and when it stopped looked at poor\nshrinking Heru as though for explanation, then round the circle of his\nawestruck courtiers, and reading dismay at my boldness in their faces,\nburst into a guttural laugh.\n\n\"I suppose you have the great and puissant Hither nation behind you in\nthis request, Mr. Spirit?\"\n\n\"No, I came alone, hoping to find justice here, and, if not, then\nprepared to do all I could to make your majesty curse the day your\nservants maltreated my friends.\"\n\n\"Tall words, stranger!  May I ask what you propose to do if Ar-hap, in\nhis own palace, amongst his people and soldiers, refuses to disgorge a\npretty prize at the bidding of one shabby interloper--muddy and\nfriendless?\"\n\n\"What should I do?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the king, with a haughty frown.  \"What would you do?\"\n\nI do not know what prompted the reply.  For a moment I was completely\nat a loss what to say to this very obvious question, and then all on a\nsudden, remembering they held me to be some kind of disembodied spirit,\nby a happy inspiration, fixing my eyes grimly on the king, I answered,\n\n\"What would I do?  Why, I WOULD HAUNT YOU!\"\n\nIt may not seem a great stroke of genius here, but the effect on the\nMartian was instantaneous.  He sat straight up, his hands tightened,\nhis eyes dilated, and then fidgeting uneasily, after a minute he\nbeckoned to an over-dressed individual, whom Heru afterwards told me\nwas the Court necromancer, and began whispering in his ear.\n\nAfter a minute's consultation he turned again, a rather frightened\ncivility struggling in his face with anger, and said, \"We have no wish,\nof course, stranger, to offend you or those who had the honour of your\npatronage.  Perhaps the princess here was a little roughly handled,\nand, I confess, if she were altogether as reluctant as she seems, a\nlesser maid would have done as well.  I could have wooed this one in\nSeth, where I may shortly come, and our espousals would possibly have\nlent, in the eyes of your friends, quite a cheerful aspect to my\narrival.  But my ambassadors have had no great schooling in diplomacy;\nthey have brought Princess Heru here, and how can I hand her over to\none I know nothing of? How do I know you are a ghost, after all?  How\ndo I know you have anything but a rusty sword and much impertinence to\nback your astounding claim?\"\n\n\"Oh, let it be just as you like,\" I said, calmly shelling and eating a\nnut I had picked up.  \"Only if you do not give the maid back, why,\nthen--\" And I stopped as though the sequel were too painful to put into\nwords.\n\nAgain that superstitious monarch of a land thronged with malicious\nspirits called up his magician, and, after they had consulted a moment,\nturned more cheerfully to me.\n\n\"Look here, Mister-from-Nowhere, if you are really a spirit, and have\nthe power to hurt as you say, you will have the power also to go and\ncome between the living and the dead, between the present and the past.\nNow I will set you an errand, and give you five minutes to do it in.\"\n\n\"Five minutes!\" I exclaimed in incautious alarm.\n\n\"Five minutes,\" said the monarch savagely.  \"And if in that time the\nerrand is not done, I shall hold you to be an impostor, an impudent\nthief from some scoundrel tribe of this world of mine, and will make of\nyou an example which shall keep men's ears tingling for a century or\ntwo.\"\n\nPoor Heru dropped in a limp and lovely heap at that dire threat, while\nI am bound to say I felt somewhat uncomfortable, not unnaturally when\nall the circumstances are considered, but contented myself with\nremarking, with as much bravado as could be managed,\n\n\"And now to the errand, Ar-hap.  What can I do for your majesty?\"\n\nThe king consulted with the rogue at his elbow, and then nodding and\nchuckling in expectancy of his triumph, addressed me.\n\n\"Listen,\" he cried, smiting a huge hairy hand upon his knee, \"listen,\nand do or die.  My magician tells me it is recorded in his books that\nonce, some five thousand years ago, when this land belonged to the\nHither people, there lived here a king.  It is a pity he died, for he\nseems to have been a jovial old fellow; but he did die, and, according\nto their custom, they floated him down the stream that flows to the\nregions of eternal ice, where doubtless he is at this present moment,\ncaked up with ten million of his subjects.  Now just go and find that\nsovereign for me, oh you bold-tongued dweller in other worlds!\"\n\n\"And if I go how am I to know your ancient king, as you say, amongst\nten million others?\"\n\n\"That is easy enough,\" quoth Ar-hap lightly.  \"You have only to pass to\nand fro through the ice mountains, opening the mouths of the dead men\nand women you meet, and when you come to a middle-sized man with a\nfillet on his head and a jaw mended with gold, that will be he whom you\nlook for. Bring me that fillet here within five minutes and the maid is\nyours.\"\n\nI started, and stared hard in amazement.  Was this a dream?  Was the\nroyal savage in front playing with me?  By what incredible chance had\nhe hit upon the very errand I could answer to best, the very trophy I\nhad brought away from the grim valley of ice and death, and had still\nin my shoulder-bag?  No, he was not playing; he was staring hard in\nturn, joying in my apparent confusion, and clearly thinking he had\ncornered me beyond hope of redemption.\n\n\"Surely your mightiness is not daunted by so simple a task,\" scowled\nthe sovereign, playing with the hilt of his huge hunting-knife, \"and\nall amongst your friends' kindred too.  On a hot day like this it ought\nto be a pleasant saunter for a spirit such as yourself.\"\n\n\"Not daunted,\" I answered coldly, turning on my heels towards the door,\n\"only marvelling that your majesty's skull and your necromancer's could\nnot between them have devised a harder task.\"\n\nOut into the courtyard I went, with my heart beating finely in spite of\nmy assumed indifference; got the bag from a peg in my sleeping-room,\nand was back before the log throne ere four minutes were gone.\n\n\"The old Hither king's compliments to your majesty,\" I said, bowing,\nwhile a deathly hush fell on all the assembly, \"and he says though your\nancestors little liked to hear his voice while alive, he says he has no\nobjection to giving you some jaw now he is dead,\" and I threw down on\nthe floor the golden circlet of the frozen king.\n\nAr-hap's eyes almost started from his head as, with his courtiers, he\nglared in silent amazement at that shining thing while the great drops\nof fear and perspiration trickled down his forehead.  As for poor Heru,\nshe rose like a spirit behind them, gazed at the jaw-bone of her\nmythical ancestor, and then suddenly realising my errand was done and\nshe apparently free, held out her hands, and, with a tremulous cry,\nwould have come to me.\n\nBut Ar-hap was too quick for her.  All the black savage blood swelled\ninto his veins as he swept her away with one great arm, and then with\nhis foot gave the luckless jaw a kick that sent it glittering and\nspinning through the far doorway out into the sunshine.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he roared, \"you brazen wench, who are so eager to leave a\nking's side for a nameless vagrant's care!  And you, sir,\" turning to\nme, and fairly trembling with rage and dread, \"I will not gainsay that\nyou have done the errand set you, but it might this once be chance that\ngot you that cursed token, some one happy turn of luck.  I will not\nyield my prize on one throw of the dice.  Another task you must do.\nOnce might be chance, but such chance comes not twice.\"\n\n\"You swore to give me the maid this time.\"\n\n\"And why should I keep my word to a half-proved spirit such as you?\"\n\n\"There are some particularly good reasons why you should,\" I said,\nstriking an attitude which I had once seen a music-hall dramatist take\nwhen he was going to blast somebody's future--a stick with a star on\ntop of it in his hand and forty lines of blank verse in his mouth.\n\nThe king writhed, and begged me with a sign to desist.\n\n\"We have no wish to anger you.  Do us this other task and none will\ndoubt that you are a potent spirit, and even I, Ar-hap, will listen to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" I answered sulkily, \"what is it to be this time?\"\n\nAfter a minute's consultation, and speaking slowly as though conscious\nof how much hung on his words, the king said,\n\n\"Listen!  My soothsayer tells me that somewhere there is a city lost in\na forest, and a temple lost in the city, and a tomb lost in the temple;\na city of ghosts and djins given over to bad spirits, wherefore all\nhuman men shun it by day and night.  And on the tomb is she who was\nonce queen there, and by her lies her crown.  Quick! oh you to whom all\ndistances are nothing, and who see, by your finer essence, into all\ntimes and places. Away to that city!  Jostle the memories of the\nunclean things that hide in its shadows; ask which amongst them knows\nwhere dead Queen Yang still lies in dusty state.  Get guides amongst\nyour comrade ghosts.  Find Queen Yang, and bring me here in five\nminutes the bloody circlet from her hair.\"\n\nThen, and then for the first time, I believed the planet was haunted\nindeed, and I myself unknowingly under some strange and watchful\ninfluence.  Spirits, demons!  Oh! what but some incomprehensible power,\nsome unseen influence shaping my efforts to its ends, could have moved\nthat hairy barbarian to play a second time into my hands like this, to\nchoose from the endless records of his world the second of the two\nincidents I had touched in hasty travel through it?  I was almost\novercome for a minute; then, pulling myself together, strode forward\nfiercely, and, speaking so that all could hear me, cried, \"Base king,\nwho neither knows the capacities of a spirit nor has learned as yet to\ndread its anger, see! your commission is executed in a thought, just as\nyour punishment might be.  Heru, come here.\"  And when the girl,\nspeechless with amazement, had risen and slipped over to me, I\nstraightened her pretty hair from her forehead, and then, in a way\nwhich would make my fortune if I could repeat it at a conjuror's table,\nwhipped poor Yang's gemmy crown from my pocket, flashed its baleful\nsplendour in the eyes of the courtiers, and placed it on the tresses of\nthe first royal lady who had worn it since its rightful owner died a\nhundred years before.\n\nA heavy silence fell on the hall as I finished, and nothing was heard\nfor a time save Heru sobbing on my breast and a thirsty baby somewhere\noutside calling to its mother for the water that was not to be had. But\npresently on those sounds came the fall of anxious feet, and a\nmessenger, entering the doorway, approached the throne, laid himself\nout flat twice, after which obeisance he proceeded to remind the king\nof the morning's ceremonial on a distant hill to \"pray away the comet,\"\ntelling his majesty that all was ready and the procession anxiously\nawaiting him.\n\nWhereon Ar-hap, obviously very well content to change the subject,\nrose, and, coming down from the dais, gave me his hand.  He was a fine\nfellow, as I have said, strong and bold, and had not behaved badly for\nan autocrat, so that I gripped his mighty fist with great pleasure.\n\n\"I cannot deny, stranger,\" he said, \"that you have done all that has\nbeen asked of you, and the maid is fairly yours.  Yet before you take\naway the prize I must have some assurance of what you yourself will do\nwith her. Therefore, for the moment, until this horrible thing in the\nsky which threatens my people with destruction has gone, let it be\ntruce between us--you to your lodgings, and the princess back,\nunharmed, amongst my women till we meet again.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said the king, waving his hand.  \"Be content with your\nadvantage.  And now to business more important than ten thousand silly\nwenches,\" and gathering up his robes over his splendid war-gear the\nwood king stalked haughtily from the hall.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nHotter and hotter grew that stifling spell, more and more languid man\nand beast, drier and drier the parching earth.\n\nAll the water gave out on the morning after I had bearded Ar-hap in his\nden, and our strength went with it.  No earthly heat was ever like it,\nand it drank our vitality up from every pore.  Water there was down\nbelow in the bitter, streaming gulf, but so noisome that we dared not\neven bathe there; here there was none but the faintest trickle.  All\ndiscipline was at an end; all desire save such as was born of thirst.\nHeru I saw as often as I wished as she lay gasping, with poor Si at her\nfeet, in the women's verandah; but the heat was so tremendous that I\ngazed at her with lack-lustre eyes, staggering to and fro amongst the\ncourtyard shadows, without nerve to plot her rescue or strength to\ncarry out anything my mind might have conceived.\n\nWe prayed for rain and respite.  Ar-hap had prayed with a wealth of\npicturesque ceremonial.  We had all prayed and cursed by turns, but\nstill the heavens would not relent, and the rain came not.\n\nAt last the stifling heat and vapour reached an almost intolerable\npitch. The earth reeked with unwholesome humours no common summer could\ndraw from it, the air was sulphurous and heavy, while overhead the sky\nseemed a tawny dome, from edge to edge of angry clouds, parting now and\nthen to let us see the red disc threatening us.\n\nHour after hour slipped by until, when evening was upon us, the clouds\ndrew together, and thunder, with a continuous low rumble, began to rock\nfrom sky to sky.  Fitful showers of rain, odorous and heavy, but\nunsatisfying, fell, and birds and beasts of the woodlands came slinking\nin to our streets and courtyards.  Ever since the sky first darkened\nour own animals had become strangely familiar, and now here were these\nwild things of the woods slinking in for companionship, sagheaded and\nfrightened.  To me especially they came, until that last evening as I\nstaggered dying about the streets or sat staring into the remorseless\nsky from the steps of Heru's prison house, all sorts of beasts drew\nsoftly in and crowded about, whether I sat or moved, all asking for the\nhope I had not to give them.\n\nAt another time this might have been embarrassing; then it seemed pure\ncommonplace.  It was a sight to see them slink in between the useless\nshowers, which fell like hot tears upon us--sleek panthers with lolling\ntongues; russet-red wood dogs; bears and sloths from the dark arcades\nof the remote forests, all casting themselves down gasping in the\npalace shadows; strange deer, who staggered to the garden plots and lay\nthere heaving their lives out; mighty boars, who came from the river\nmarshes and silently nozzled a place amongst their enemies to die in!\nEven the wolves came off the hills, and, with bloodshot eyes and\ntongues that dripped foam, flung themselves down in my shadow.\n\nAll along the tall stockades apes sat sad and listless, and on the\nroof-ridges storks were dying.  Over the branches of the trees, whose\nleaves were as thin as though we had had a six months' drought, the\ntoucans and Martian parrots hung limp and fashionless like gaudy rags,\nand in the courtyard ground the corn-rats came up from their tunnels in\nthe scorching earth to die, squeaking in scores along under the walls.\n\nOur common sorrow made us as sociable as though I were Noah, and\nAr-hap's palace mound another Ararat.  Hour after hour I sat amongst\nall these lesser beasts in the hot darkness, waiting for the end.\nEvery now and then the heavy clouds parted, changing the gloom to\nsudden fiery daylight as the great red eye in the west looked upon us\nthrough the crevice, and, taking advantage of those gleams, I would\nreel across to where, under a spout leading from a dried rivulet, I had\nplaced a cup to collect the slow and tepid drops that were all now\ncoming down the reed for Heru. And as I went back each time with that\nsickly spoonful at the bottom of the vessel all the dying beasts lifted\ntheir heads and watched--the thirsty wolves shambling after me; the\nboars half sat up and grunted plaintively; the panthers, too weak to\nrise, beat the dusty ground with their tails; and from the portico the\nblue storks, with trailing wings, croaked husky greeting.\n\nBut slower and slower came the dripping water, more and more\nintolerable the heat.  At last I could stand it no longer.  What\npurpose did it serve to lay gasping like this, dying cruelly without a\nhope of rescue, when a shorter way was at my side?  I had not drank for\na day and a half. I was past active reviling; my head swam; my reason\nwas clouded.  No! I would not stand it any longer.  Once more I would\ntake Heru and poor Si the cup that was but a mockery after all, then\nfix my sword into the ground and try what next the Fates had in store\nfor me.\n\nSo once again the leathern mug was fetched and carried through the\nprostrate guards to where the Martian girl lay, like a withered flower,\nupon her couch.  Once again I moistened those fair lips, while my own\ntongue was black and swollen in my throat, then told Si, who had had\nnone all the afternoon, to drink half and leave half for Heru.  Poor Si\nput her aching lips to the cup and tilted it a little, then passed it\nto her mistress.  And Heru drank it all, and Si cried a few hot tears\nbehind her hands, FOR SHE HAD TAKEN NONE, and she knew it was her life!\n\nAgain picking a way through the courtyard, scarce noticing how the\nbeasts lifted their heads as I passed, I went instinctively, cup in\nhand, to the well, and then hesitated.  Was I a coward to leave Heru\nso? Ought I not to stay and see it out to the bitter end?  Well, I\nwould compound with Fate.  I would give the malicious gods one more\nchance. I would put the cup down again, and until seven drops had\nfallen into it I would wait.  That there might be no mistake about it,\nno sooner was the mug in place under the nozzle wherefrom the moisture\nbeads collected and fell with infinite slowness, than my sword, on\nwhich I meant to throw myself, was bared and the hilt forced into a\ngaping crack in the ground, and sullenly contented to leave my fate so,\nI sat down beside it.\n\nI turned grimly to the spout and saw the first drop fall, then another,\nand another later on, but still no help came.  There was a long rift in\nthe clouds now, and a glare like that from an open furnace door was\nupon me.  I had noticed when I came to the spring how the comet which\nwas killing us hung poised exactly upon the point of a distant hill. If\nhe had passed his horrible meridian, if he was going from us, if he\nsunk but a hair's breadth before that seventh drop should fall, I could\ntell it would mean salvation.\n\nBut the fourth drop fell, and he was big as ever.  The fifth drop fell,\nand a hot, pleasing nose was thrust into my hand, and looking down I\nsaw a grey wolf had dragged herself across the court and was asking\nwith eloquent eyes for the help I could not give.  The sixth drop\ngathered, and fell; already the seventh was like a seedling pearl in\nits place. The dying wolf yanked affectionately at my hand, but I put\nher by and undid my tunic.  Big and bright that drop hung to the spout\nlip; another minute and it would fall.  A beautiful drop, I laughed,\npeering closely at it, many-coloured, prismatic, flushing red and pink,\na tiny living ruby, hanging by a touch to the green rim above; enough!\nenough!  The quiver of an eyelash would unhinge it now; and angry with\nthe life I already felt was behind me, and turning in defiant\nexpectation to the new to come, I rose, saw the red gleam of my sword\njutting like a fiery spear from the cracking soil where I had planted\nit, then looked once more at the drop and glanced for the last time at\nthe sullen red terror on the hill.\n\nWere my eyes dazed, my senses reeling?  I said a space ago that the\nmeteor stood exactly on the mountain-top and if it sunk a hair's\nbreadth I should note it; and now, why, there WAS a flaw in its lower\nmargin, a flattening of the great red foot that before had been round\nand perfect. I turned my smarting eyes away a minute,--saw the seventh\ndrop fall with a melodious tingle into the cup, then back again,--there\nwas no mistake--the truant fire was a fraction less, it had shrunk a\nfraction behind the hill even since I looked, and thereon all my life\nran back into its channels, the world danced before me, and \"Heru!\" I\nshouted hoarsely, reeling back towards the palace, \"Heru, 'tis well;\nthe worst is past!\"\n\nBut the little princess was unconscious, and at her feet was poor Si,\nquite dead, still reclining with her head in her hands just as I had\nleft her.  Then my own senses gave out, and dropping down by them I\nremembered no more.\n\nI must have lain there an hour or two, for when consciousness came\nagain it was night--black, cool, profound night, with an inky sky low\ndown upon the tree-tops, and out of it such a glorious deluge of rain\ndescending swiftly and silently as filled my veins even to listen to.\nEagerly I shuffled away to the porch steps, down them into the swimming\ncourtyard, and ankle-deep in the glorious flood, set to work lapping\nfuriously at the first puddle, drinking with gasps of pleasure, gasping\nand drinking again, feeling my body filling out like the thirsty\nsteaming earth below me.  Then, as I still drank insatiably, there came\na gleam of lightning out of the gloom overhead, a brilliant yellow\nblaze, and by it I saw a few yards away a panther drinking at the same\npool as myself, his gleaming eyes low down like mine upon the water,\nand by his side two apes, the black water running in at their gaping\nmouths, while out beyond were more pools, more drinking animals.\nEverything was drinking. I saw their outlined forms, the gleam shining\non wet skins as though they were cut out in silver against the\ndarkness, each beast steaming like a volcano as the Heaven-sent rain\nsmoked from his fevered hide, all drinking for their lives, heedless of\naught else--and then came the thunder.\n\nIt ran across the cloudy vault as though the very sky were being ripped\napart, rolling in mighty echoes here and there before it died away. As\nit stopped, the rain also fell less heavily for a minute, and as I lay\nwith my face low down I heard the low, contented lapping of numberless\ntongues unceasing, insatiable.  Then came the lightning again, lighting\nup everything as though it were daytime.  The twin black apes were\nstill drinking, but the panther across the puddle had had enough; I saw\nhim lift his grateful head up to the flare; saw the limp red tongue\nlicking the black nose, the green eyes shining like opals, the water\ndripping in threads of diamonds from the hairy tag under his chin and\nevery tuft upon his chest--then darkness again.\n\nTo and fro the green blaze rocked between the thunder crashes.  It\nstruck a house a hundred yards away, stripping every shingle from the\nroof better than a master builder could in a week.  It fell a minute\nafter on a tall tree by the courtyard gate, and as the trunk burst into\nwhite splinters I saw every leaf upon the feathery top turn light side\nup against the violet reflection in the sky beyond, and then the whole\nmass came down to earth with a thud that crushed the courtyard palings\ninto nothing for twenty yards and shook me even across the square.\n\nAnother time I might have stopped to marvel or to watch, as I have\noften watched with sympathetic pleasure, the gods thus at play; but\ntonight there were other things on hand.  When I had drunk, I picked up\nan earthen crock, filled it, and went to Heru.  It was a rough\ndrinking-vessel for those dainty lips, and an indifferent draught,\nbeing as much mud as aught else, but its effect was wonderful.  At the\nfirst touch of that turgid stuff a shiver of delight passed through the\ndrowsy lady.  At the second she gave a sigh, and her hand tightened on\nmy arm.  I fetched another crockful, and by the flickering light\nrocking to and fro in the sky, took her head upon my shoulder, like a\nprodigal new come into riches, squandering the stuff, giving her to\ndrink and bathing face and neck till presently, to my delight, the\nprincess's eyes opened.  Then she sat up, and taking the basin from me\ndrank as never lady drank before, and soon was almost herself again.\n\nI went out into the portico, there snuffing the deep, strong breath of\nthe fragrant black earth receiving back into its gaping self what the\nlast few days had taken from it, while quick succeeding thoughts of\nescape and flight passed across my brain.  All through the fiery time\nwe had just had the chance of escaping with the fair booty yonder had\nbeen present. Without her, flight would have been easy enough, but that\nwas not worth considering for a moment.  With her it was more\ndifficult, yet, as I had watched the woodmen, accustomed to cool forest\nshades, faint under the fiery glare of the world above, to make a dash\nfor liberty seemed each hour more easy.  I had seen the men in the\nstreets drop one by one, and the spears fall from the hands of guards\nabout the pallisades; I had seen messengers who came to and fro\ncollapse before their errands were accomplished, and the forest women,\nwho were Heru's gaolers, groan and drop across the thresholds of her\nprison, until at length the way was clear--a babe might have taken what\nhe would from that half-scorched town and asked no man's leave.  Yet\nwhat did it avail me?  Heru was helpless, my own spirit burnt in a\nnerveless frame, and so we stayed.\n\nBut with rain strength came back to both of us.  The guards, lying\nabout like black logs, were only slowly returning to consciousness; the\ntown still slept, and darkness favoured; before they missed us in the\nmorning light we might be far on the way back to Seth--a dangerous way\ntruly, but we were like to tread a rougher one if we stayed.  In fact,\ndirectly my strength returned with the cooler air, I made up my mind to\nthe venture and went to Heru, who by this time was much recovered. To\nher I whispered my plot, and that gentle lady, as was only natural,\ntrembled at its dangers.  But I put it to her that no time could be\nbetter than the present: the storm was going over; morning would \"line\nthe black mantle of the night with a pink dawn of promise\"; before any\none stirred we might be far off, shaping a course by our luck and the\nstars for her kindred, at whose name she sighed.  If we stayed, I\nargued, and the king changed his mind, then death for me, and for Heru\nthe arms of that surly monarch, and all the rest of her life caged in\nthese pallisades amongst the uncouth forms about us.\n\nThe lady gave a frightened little shiver at the picture, but after a\nmoment, laying her head upon my shoulder, answered, \"Oh, my guardian\nspirit and helper in adversity, I too have thought of tomorrow, and\ndoubt whether that horror, that great swine who has me, will not invent\nan excuse for keeping me.  Therefore, though the forest roads are\ndreadful, and Seth very far away, I will come; I give myself into your\nhands. Do what you will with me.\"\n\n\"Then the sooner the better, princess.  How soon can you be prepared?\"\n\nShe smiled, and stooping picked up her slippers, saying as she did so,\n\"I am ready!\"\n\nThere were no arrangements to be made.  Every instant was of value. So,\nto be brief, I threw a dark cloak over the damsel's shoulders, for\nindeed she was clad in little more than her loveliness and the gauziest\nfilaments of a Hither girl's underwear, and hand in hand led her down\nthe log steps, over the splashing, ankle-deep courtyard, and into the\nshadows of the gateway beyond.\n\nDown the slope we went; along towards the harbour, through a score of\ndeserted lanes where nothing was to be heard but the roar of rain and\nthe lapping of men and beasts, drinking in the shadows as though they\nnever would stop, and so we came at last unmolested to the wharf.\nThere I hid royal Seth between two piles of merchandise, and went to\nlook for a boat suitable to our needs.  There were plenty of small\ncraft moored to rings along the quay, and selecting a canoe--it was no\ntime to stand on niceties of property--easily managed by a single\npaddle, I brought it round to the steps, put in a fresh water-pot, and\nwent for the princess.\n\nWith her safely stowed in the prow, a helpless, sodden little morsel of\nfeminine loveliness, things began to appear more hopeful and an escape\ndown to blue water, my only idea, for the first time possible.  Yet I\nmust needs go and well nigh spoil everything by over-solicitude for my\ncharge.\n\nHad we pushed off at once there can be no doubt my credit as a spirit\nwould have been established for all time in the Thither capital, and\nthe belief universally held that Heru had been wafted away by my\nenchantment to the regions of the unknown.  The idea would have\ngradually grown into a tradition, receiving embellishments in\nsucceeding generations, until little wood children at their mother's\nknees came to listen in awe to the story of how, once upon a time, the\nSun-god loved a beautiful maiden, and drove his fiery chariot across\nthe black night-fields to her prison door, scorching to death all who\nstrove to gainsay him.  How she flew into his arms and drove away\nbefore all men's eyes, in his red car, into the west, and was never\nseen again--the foresaid Sun-god being I, Gulliver Jones, a much\nunder-paid lieutenant in the glorious United States navy, with a packet\nof overdue tailors' bills in my pocket, and nothing lovable about me\nsave a partiality for meddling with other people's affairs.\n\nThis is how it might have been, but I spoiled a pretty fairy story and\nchanged the whole course of Martian history by going back at that\nmoment in search of a wrap for my prize.  Right on top of the steps was\na man with a lantern, and half a glance showed me it was the harbour\nmaster met with on my first landing.\n\n\"Good evening,\" he said suspiciously.  \"May I ask what you are doing on\nthe quay at such an hour as this?\"\n\n\"Doing?  Oh, nothing in particular, just going out for a little\nfishing.\"\n\n\"And your companion the lady--is she too fond of fishing?\"\n\nI swore between my teeth, but could not prevent the fellow walking to\nthe quay edge and casting his light full upon the figure of the girl\nbelow. I hate people who interfere with other people's business!\n\n\"Unless I am very much mistaken your fishing friend is the Hither woman\nbrought here a few days ago as tribute to Ar-hap.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I answered, getting into a nice temper, for I had been very\nmuch harrassed of late, \"put it at that.  What would you do if it were\nso?\"\n\n\"Call up my rain-drunk guards, and give you in charge as a thief caught\nmeddling with the king's property.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but as my interviews with Ar-hap have already begun to grow\ntedious, we will settle this little matter here between ourselves at\nonce.\"  And without more to-do I closed with him.  There was a brief\nscuffle and then I got in a blow upon his jaw which sent the harbour\nmaster flying back head over heels amongst the sugar bales and potatoes.\n\nWithout waiting to see how he fared I ran down the steps, jumped on\nboard, loosened the rope, and pushed out into the river.  But my heart\nwas angry and sore, for I knew, as turned out to be the case, that our\nsecret was one no more; in a short time we should have the savage king\nin pursuit, and now there was nothing for it but headlong flight with\nonly a small chance of getting away to distant Seth.\n\nLuckily the harbour master lay insensible until he was found at dawn,\nso that we had a good start, and the moment the canoe passed from the\narcade-like approach to the town the current swung her head\nautomatically seaward, and away we went down stream at a pace once more\nfilling me with hope.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nAll went well and we fled down the bitter stream of the Martian gulf at\na pace leaving me little to do but guide our course just clear of snags\nand promontories on the port shore.  Just before dawn, however, with a\nthin mist on the water and flocks of a flamingo-like bird croaking as\nthey flew southward overhead, we were nearly captured again.\n\nDrifting silently down on a rocky island, I was having a drink at the\nwater-pitcher at the moment, while Heru, her hair beaded with prismatic\nmoisture and looking more ethereal than ever, sat in the bows\ntimorously inhaling the breath of freedom, when all on a sudden voices\ninvisible in the mist, came round a corner.  It was one of Ar-hap's\nwar-canoes toiling up-stream.  Heru and I ducked down into the haze\nlike dab-chicks and held our breath.\n\nStraight on towards us came the toiling ship, the dip of oars resonant\nin the hollow fog and a ripple babbling on her cutwater plainly\ndiscernible.\n\n\n  Oh, oh!\n  Hoo, hoo!\n  How high, how high!\"\n\nsounded the sleepy song of the rowers till they were looming right\nabreast and we could smell their damp hides in the morning air.  Then\nthey stopped suddenly and some one asked,\n\n\"Is there not something like a boat away on the right?\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" said another, \"but the lees of last night's beer\ncurdling in your stupid brain.\"\n\n\"But I saw it move.\"\n\n\"That must have been in dreams.\"\n\n\"What is all that talking about?\" growled a sleepy voice of authority\nfrom the stern.\n\n\"Bow man, sir, says he can see a boat.\"\n\n\"And what does it matter if he can?  Are we to delay every time that\nlazy ruffian spying a shadow makes it an excuse to stop to yawn and\nscratch? Go on, you plankful of lubbers, or I'll give you something\nworth thinking about!\"  And joyfully, oh, so joyfully, we heard the\nsullen dip of oars commence again.\n\nNothing more happened after that till the sun at length shone on the\nlittle harbour town at the estuary mouth, making the masts of fishing\ncraft clustering there like a golden reed-bed against the cool, clean\nblue of the sea beyond.\n\nRight glad we were to see it, and keeping now in shadow of the banks,\nmade all haste while light was faint and mist hung about to reach the\ntown, finally pushing through the boats and gaining a safe hiding-place\nwithout hostile notice before it was clear daylight.\n\nCovering Heru up and knowing well all our chances of escape lay in\nexpedition, I went at once, in pursuance of a plan made during the\nnight, to the good dame at what, for lack of a better name, must still\ncontinue to be called the fish-shop, and finding her alone, frankly\ntold her the salient points of my story.  When she learned I had\n\"robbed the lion of his prey\" and taken his new wife singlehanded from\nthe dreaded Ar-hap her astonishment was unbounded.  Nothing would do\nbut she must look upon the princess, so back we went to the\nhiding-place, and when Heru knew that on this woman depended our lives\nshe stepped ashore, taking the rugged Martian hand in her dainty\nfingers and begging her help so sweetly that my own heart was moved,\nand, thrusting hands in pocket, I went aside, leaving those two to\nsettle it in their own female way.\n\nAnd when I looked back in five minutes, royal Seth had her arms round\nthe woman's neck, kissing the homely cheeks with more than imperial\nfervour, so I knew all was well thus far, and stopped expectorating at\nthe little fishes in the water below and went over to them.  It was\ntime!  We had hardly spoken together a minute when a couple of\nwar-canoes filled with men appeared round the nearest promontory,\ncoming down the swift water with arrow-like rapidity.\n\n\"Quick!\" said the fishwife, \"or we are all lost.  Into your canoe and\npaddle up this creek.  It runs out to the sea behind the town, and at\nthe bar is my man's fishing-boat amongst many others.  Lie hidden there\ntill he comes if you value your lives.\"  So in we got, and while that\ngood Samaritan went back to her house we cautiously paddled through a\ndeserted backwater to where it presently turned through low sandbanks\nto the gulf.  There were the boats, and we hid the canoe and lay down\namongst them till, soon after, a man, easily recognised as the husband\nof our friend, came sauntering down from the village.\n\nAt first he was sullen, not unreasonably alarmed at the danger into\nwhich his good woman was running him.  But when he set eyes on Heru he\nsoftened immediately.  Probably that thick-bodied fellow had never seen\nso much female loveliness in so small a bulk in all his life, and,\nbeing a man, he surrendered at discretion.\n\n\"In with you, then,\" he growled, \"since I must needs risk my neck for a\npair of runaways who better deserve to be hung than I do.  In with you\nboth into this fishing-cobble of mine, and I will cover you with nets\nwhile I go for a mast and sail, and mind you lie as still as logs. The\ntown is already full of soldiers looking for you, and it will be short\nshrift for us all if you are seen.\"\n\nWell aware of the fact and now in the hands of destiny, the princess\nand I lay down as bidden in the prow, and the man covered us lightly\nover with one of those fine meshed seines used by these people to catch\nthe little fish I had breakfasted on more than once.\n\nMaterially I could have enjoyed the half-hour which followed, since\nsuch rest after exertion was welcome, the sun warm, the lapping of sea\non shingle infinitely soothing, and, above all, Heru was in my arms!\nHow sweet and childlike she was!  I could feel her little heart beating\nthrough her scanty clothing, while every now and then she turned her\ngazelle eyes to mine with a trust and admiration infinitely alluring.\nYes! as far as that went I could have lain there with that slip of\nmaiden royalty for ever, but the fascination of the moment was marred\nby the thought of our danger.  What was to prevent these new friends\ngiving us away?  They knew we had no money to recompense them for the\nrisk they were running.  They were poor, and a splendid reward, wealth\nitself to them, would doubtless be theirs if they betrayed us even by a\nlook.  Yet somehow I trusted them as I have trusted the poor before\nwith the happiest results, and telling myself this and comforting Heru,\nI listened and waited.\n\nMinute by minute went by.  It seemed an age since the fisherman had\ngone, but presently the sound of voices interrupted the sea's murmur.\nCautiously stealing a glance through a chink imagine my feelings on\nperceiving half a dozen of Ar-hap's soldiers coming down the beach\nstraight towards us!  Then my heart was bitter within me, and I tasted\nof defeat, even with Heru in my arms.  Luckily even in that moment of\nagony I kept still, and another peep showed the men were now wandering\nabout rather aimlessly.  Perhaps after all they did not know of our\nnearness? Then they took to horseplay, as idle soldiers will even in\nMars, pelting each other with bits of wood and dead fish, and thereon I\nbreathed again.\n\nNearer they came and nearer, my heart beating fast as they strolled\namongst the boats until they were actually \"larking\" round the one next\nto ours.  A minute or two of this, and another footstep crunched on the\npebbles, a quick, nervous one, which my instinct told me was that of\nour returning friend.\n\n\"Hullo old sprat-catcher!  Going for a sail?\" called out a soldier, and\nI knew that the group were all round our boat, Heru trembling so\nviolently in my breast that I thought she would make the vessel shake.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man gruffly.\n\n\"Let's go with him,\" cried several voices.  \"Here, old dried haddock,\nwill you take us if we help haul your nets for you?\"\n\n\"No, I won't.  Your ugly faces would frighten all the fish out of the\nsea.\"\n\n\"And yours, you old chunk of dried mahogany, is meant to attract them\nno doubt.\"\n\n\"Let's tie him to a post and go fishing in his boat ourselves,\" some\none suggested.  Meanwhile two of them began rocking the cobble\nviolently from side to side.  This was awful, and every moment I\nexpected the net and the sail which our friend had thrown down\nunceremoniously upon us would roll off.\n\n\"Oh, stop that,\" said the Martian, who was no doubt quite as well aware\nof the danger as we were.  \"The tide's full, the shoals are in the\nbay--stop your nonsense, and help me launch like good fellows.\"\n\n\"Well, take two of us, then.  We will sit on this heap of nets as quiet\nas mice, and stand you a drink when we get back.\"\n\n\"No, not one of you,\" quoth the plucky fellow, \"and here's my staff in\nmy hand, and if you don't leave my gear alone I will crack some of your\nugly heads.\"\n\n\"That's a pity,\" I thought to myself, \"for if they take to fighting it\nwill be six to one--long odds against our chances.\"  There was indeed a\nscuffle, and then a yell of pain, as though a soldier had been hit\nacross the knuckles; but in a minute the best disposed called out, \"Oh,\ncease your fun, boys, and let the fellow get off if he wants to.  You\nknow the fleet will be down directly, and Ar-hap has promised something\nworth having to the man who can find that lost bit of crackling of his.\nIt's my opinion she's in the town, and I for one would rather look for\nher than go haddock fishing any day.\"\n\n\"Right you are, mates,\" said our friend with visible relief.  \"And,\nwhat's more, if you help me launch this boat and then go to my missus\nand tell her what you've done, she'll understand, and give you the\nbiggest pumpkinful of beer in the place.  Ah, she will understand, and\nbless your soft hearts and heads while you drink it--she's a cute one\nis my missus.\"\n\n\"And aren't you afraid to leave her with us?\"\n\n\"Not I, my daisy, unless it were that a sight of your pretty face might\ngive her hysterics.  Now lend a hand, your accursed chatter has already\ncost me half an hour of the best fishing time.\"\n\n\"In with you, old buck!\" shouted the soldiers; I felt the fisherman\nstep in, as a matter of fact he stepped in on to my toes; a dozen hands\nwere on the gunwales: six soldier yells resounded, it seemed, in my\nvery ears: there was the grit and rush of pebbles under the keel: a\nsudden lurch up of the bows, which brought the fairy lady's\nhoney-scented lips to mine, and then the gentle lapping of deep blue\nwaters underneath us!\n\nThere is little more to be said of that voyage.  We pulled until out of\nsight of the town, then hoisted sail, and, with a fair wind, held upon\none tack until we made an island where there was a small colony of\nHither folk.\n\nHere our friend turned back.  I gave him another gold button from my\ncoat, and the princess a kiss upon either cheek, which he seemed to\nlike even more than the button.  It was small payment, but the best we\nhad. Doubtless he got safely home, and I can but hope that Providence\nsomehow or other paid him and his wife for a good deed bravely done.\n\nThose islanders in turn lent us another boat, with a guide, who had\nbusiness in the Hither capital, and on the evening of the second day,\nthe direct route being very short in comparison, we were under the\ncrumbling marble walls of Seth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nIt was like turning into a hothouse from a keen winter walk, our\narrival at the beautiful but nerveless city after my life amongst the\nwoodmen.\n\nAs for the people, they were delighted to have their princess back, but\nwith the delight of children, fawning about her, singing, clapping\nhands, yet asking no questions as to where she had been, showing no\nappreciation of our adventures--a serious offence in my eyes--and,\nperhaps most important of all, no understanding of what I may call the\npolitical bearings of Heru's restoration, and how far their arch\nenemies beyond the sea might be inclined to attempt her recovery.\n\nThey were just delighted to have the princess back, and that was the\nend of it.  Theirs was the joy of a vast nursery let loose.  Flower\nprocessions were organised, garlands woven by the mile, a general order\nissued that the nation might stay up for an hour after bedtime, and in\nthe vortex of that gentle rejoicing Heru was taken from me, and I saw\nher no more, till there happened the wildest scene of all you have\nshared with me so patiently.\n\nOverlooked, unthanked, I turned sulky, and when this mood, one I can\nnever maintain for long, wore off, I threw myself into the dissipation\nabout me with angry zeal.  I am frankly ashamed of the confession, but\nI was \"a sailor ashore,\" and can only claim the indulgences proper to\nthe situation.  I laughed, danced, drank, through the night; I drank\ndeep of a dozen rosy ways to forgetfulness, till my mind was a great\nconfusion, full of flitting pictures of loveliness, till life itself\nwas an illusive pantomime, and my will but thistle-down on the folly of\nthe moment.  I drank with those gentle roisterers all through their\nstarlit night, and if we stopped when morning came it was more from\nweariness than virtue.  Then the yellow-robed slaves gave us the wine\nof recovery--alas! my faithful An was not amongst them--and all through\nthe day we lay about in sodden happiness.\n\nTowards nightfall I was myself again, not unfortunately with the\nheadache well earned, but sufficiently remorseful to be in a vein to\nmake good resolutions for the future.\n\nIn this mood I mingled with a happy crowd, all purposeless and cheerful\nas usual, but before long began to feel the influence of one of those\ndrifts, a universal turning in one direction, as seaweed turns when the\ntide changes, so characteristic of Martian society.  It was dusk, a\nlovely soft velvet dusk, but not dark yet, and I said to a yellow-robed\nfairy at my side:\n\n\"Whither away, comrade?  It is not eight bells yet.  Surely we are not\ngoing to be put to bed so early as this?\"\n\n\"No,\" said that smiling individual, \"it is the princess.  We are going\nto listen to Princess Heru in the palace square.  She reads the globe\non the terrace again tonight, to see if omens are propitious for her\nmarriage. She MUST marry, and you know the ceremony has been\nunavoidably postponed so far.\"\n\n\"Unavoidably postponed?\"  Yes, Heaven wotted I was aware of the fact.\nAnd was Heru going to marry black Hath in such a hurry?  And after all\nI had done for her?  It was scarcely decent, and I tried to rouse\nmyself to rage over it, but somehow the seductive Martian contentment\nwith any fate was getting into my veins.  I was not yet altogether sunk\nin their slothful acceptance of the inevitable, but there was not the\nslightest doubt the hot red blood in me was turning to vapid stuff such\nas did duty for the article in their veins.  I mustered up a\nhalf-hearted frown at this unwelcome intelligence, turning with it on\nmy face towards the slave girl; but she had slipped away into the\nthrong, so the frown evaporated, and shrugging my shoulders I said to\nmyself, \"What does it matter? There are twenty others will do as well\nfor me.  If not one, why then obviously another, 'tis the only rational\nway to think, and at all events there is the magic globe.  That may\ntell us something.\"  And slipping my arm round the waist of the first\ndisengaged girl--we were not then, mind you, in Atlantic City--I kissed\nher dimpling cheek unreproached, and gaily followed in the drift of\nhumanity, trending with a low hum of pleasure towards the great white\nterraces under the palace porch.\n\nHow well I knew them!  It was just such an evening Heru had consulted\nFate in the same place once before; how much had happened since then!\nBut there was little time or inclination to think of those things now.\nThe whole phantom city's population had drifted to one common centre.\nThe crumbling seaward ramparts were all deserted; no soldier watch was\nkept to note if angry woodmen came from over seas; a soft wind blew in\nfrom off the brine, but told no tales; the streets were empty, and,\nwhen as we waited far away in the southern sky the earth planet\npresently got up, by its light Heru, herself again, came tripping down\nthe steps to read her fate.\n\nThey had placed another magic globe under a shroud on a tripod for her.\nIt stood within the charmed circle upon the terrace, and I was close\nby, although the princess did not see me.\n\nAgain that weird, fantastic dance commenced, the princess working\nherself up from the drowsiest undulations to a hurricane of emotion.\nThen she stopped close by the orb, and seized the corner of the web\ncovering it. We saw the globe begin to beam with veiled magnificence at\nher touch.\n\nNot an eye wavered, not a thought wandered from her in all that silent\nmultitude.  It was a moment of the keenest suspense, and just when it\nwas at its height there came a strange sound of hurrying feet behind\nthe outermost crowd, a murmur such as a great pack of wolves might make\nrushing through snow, while a soft long wail went up from the darkness.\n\nWhether Heru understood it or not I cannot say, but she hesitated a\nmoment, then swept the cloth from the orb of her fate.\n\nAnd as its ghostly, self-emitting light beamed up in the darkness with\nweird brilliancy, there by it, in gold and furs and war panoply, huge,\nfierce, and lowering, stood--AR-HAP HIMSELF!\n\nAy, and behind him, towering over the crouching Martians, blocking\nevery outlet and street, were scores and hundreds of his men.  Never\nwas surprise so utter, ambush more complete.  Even I was transfixed\nwith astonishment, staring with open-mouthed horror at the splendid\nfigure of the barbarian king as he stood aglitter in the ruddy light,\nscowling defiance at the throng around him.  So silently had he come on\nhis errand of vengeance it was difficult to believe he was a reality,\nand not some clever piece of stageplay, some vision conjured up by\nMartian necromancy.\n\nBut he was good reality.  In a minute comedy turned to tragedy.  Ar-hap\ngave a sign with his hand, whereon all his men set up a terrible\nwarcry, the like of which Seth had not heard for very long, and as far\nas I could make out in the half light began hacking and hewing my\nluckless friends with all their might.  Meanwhile the king made at\nHeru, feeling sure of her this time, and doubtless intending to make\nher taste his vengeance to the dregs; and seeing her handled like that,\nand hearing her plaintive cries, wrath took the place of stupid\nsurprise in me.  I was on my feet in a second, across the intervening\nspace, and with all my force gave the king a blow upon the jaw which\nsent even him staggering backwards. Before I could close again, so\nswift was the sequence of events in those flying minutes, a wild mob of\npeople, victims and executioners in one disordered throng, was between\nus.  How the king fared I know not, nor stopped to ask, but half\ndragging, half carrying Heru through the shrieking mob, got her up the\npalace steps and in at the great doors, which a couple of yellow-clad\nslaves, more frightened of the barbarians than thoughtful of the crowd\nwithout, promptly clapped to, and shot the bolts.  Thus we were safe\nfor a moment, and putting the princess on a couch, I ran up a short\nflight of stairs and looked out of a front window to see if there were\na chance of succouring those in the palace square. But it was all\nhopeless chaos with the town already beginning to burn and not a show\nof fight anywhere which I could join.\n\nI glared out on that infernal tumult for a moment or two in an agony of\nimpotent rage, then turned towards the harbour and saw in the shine of\nthe burning town below the ancient battlements and towers of Seth begin\nto gleam out, like a splendid frost work of living metal clear-cut\nagainst the smooth, black night behind, and never a show of resistance\nthere either.  Ay, and by this time Ar-hap's men were battering in our\ngates with a big beam, and somehow, I do not know how it happened, the\npalace itself away on the right, where the dry-as-dust library lay, was\nalso beginning to burn.\n\nIt was hopeless outside, and nothing to be done but to save Heru, so\ndown I went, and, with the slaves, carried her away from the hall\nthrough a vestibule or two, and into an anteroom, where some\nyellow-girt individuals were already engaged in the suggestive work of\ntying up palace plate in bundles, amongst other things, alas! the great\ngold love-bowl from which--oh! so long ago--I had drawn Heru's marriage\nbillet. These individuals told me in tremulous accents they had got a\nboat on a secret waterway behind the palace whence flight to the main\nriver and so, far away inland, to another smaller but more peaceful\ncity of their race would be quite practical; and joyfully hearing this\nnews, I handed over to them the princess while I went to look for Hath.\n\nAnd the search was not long.  Dashing into the banquet-hall, still\nlittered with the remains of a feast, and looking down its deserted\nvistas, there at the farther end, on his throne, clad in the sombre\ngarments he affected, chin on hand, sedate in royal melancholy,\nlistening unmoved to the sack of his town outside, sat the prince\nhimself.  Strange, gloomy man, the great dead intelligence of his race\nshining in his face as weird and out of place as a lonely sea beacon\nfading to nothing before the glow of sunrise, never had he appeared so\nmysterious as at that moment. Even in the heat of excitement I stared\nat him in amazement, wishing in a hasty thought the confusion of the\npast few weeks had given me opportunity to penetrate the recesses of\nhis mind, and therefrom retell you things better worth listening to\nthan all the incident of my adventures. But now there was no time to\nthink, scarce time to act.\n\n\"Hath!\" I cried, rushing over to him, \"wake up, your majesty.  The\nThither men are outside, killing and burning!\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"And the palace is on fire.  You can smell the reek even here.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"My word, that is a fine proposition for a prince!  If you care nothing\nfor town or palace perhaps you will bestir yourself for Princess Heru.\"\n\nA faint glimmer of interest rose upon the alabaster calm of his face at\nthat name, but it faded instantly, and he said quietly,\n\n\"The slaves will save her.  She will live.  I looked into the book of\nher fate yesterday.  She will escape, and forget, and sit at another\nmarriage feast, and be a mother, and give the people yet one more\nprince to keep the faint glimmer of our ancestry alive.  I am content.\"\n\n\"But, d--- it, man, I am not!  I take a deal more interest in the young\nlady than you seem to, and have scoured half this precious planet of\nyours on her account, and will be hanged if I sit idly twiddling my\nthumbs while her pretty skin is in danger.\"  But Hath was lost in\ncontemplation of his shoe-strings.\n\n\"Come, sir,\" I said, shaking his majesty by the shoulder, \"don't be\ndown on your luck.  There has been some rivalry between us, but never\nmind about that just now.  The princess wants you.  I am going to save\nboth her and you, you must come with her.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But you SHALL come.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nBy this time the palace was blazing like a bonfire and the uproar\noutside was terrible.  What was I to do?  As I hesitated the arras at\nthe further end of the hall was swept aside, a disordered mob of slaves\nbearing bundles and dragging Heru with them rushing down to the door\nnear us. As Heru was carried swiftly by she stretched her milk-white\narms towards the prince and turned her face, lovely as a convolvulus\nflower even in its pallor, upon him.\n\nIt was a heart-moving appeal from a woman with the heart of a child,\nand Hath rose to his feet while for a moment there shone a look of\nresponsible manhood in his eyes.  But it faded quickly; he bowed slowly\nas though he had received an address of condolence on the condition of\nhis empire, and the next moment the frightened slaves, stumbling under\ntheir burdens, had swept poor Heru through the doorway.\n\nI glanced savagely round at the curling smoke overhead, the red\ntendrils of fire climbing up a distant wall, and there on a table by us\nwas a half-finished flask of the lovely tinted wine of forgetfulness.\nIf Hath would not come sober perhaps he might come drunk.\n\n\"Here,\" I cried, \"drink to tomorrow, your majesty, a sovereign toast in\nall ages, and better luck next time with these hairy gentlemen\nbattering at your majesty's doors,\" and splashing out a goblet full of\nthe stuff I handed it to him.\n\nHe took it and looked rather lovingly into the limpid pool, then\ndeliberately poured it on the step in front of him, and throwing the\ncup away said pleasantly,\n\n\"Not tonight, good comrade; tonight I drink a deeper draught of\noblivion than that,--and here come my cup-bearers.\"\n\nEven while he spoke the palace gates had given way; there was a\nhorrible medley of shrieks and cries, a quick sound of running feet;\nthen again the arras lifted and in poured a horde of Ar-hap's\nmen-at-arms.  The moment they caught sight of us about a dozen of them,\narmed with bows, drew the thick hide strings to their ears and down the\nhall came a ravening flight of shafts.  One went through my cap, two\nstuck quivering in the throne, and one, winged with owl feather, caught\nblack Hath full in the bosom.\n\nHe had stood out boldly at the first coming of that onset, arms crossed\non breast, chin up, and looking more of a gentleman than I had ever\nseen him look before; and now, stricken, he smiled gravely, then\nwithout flinching, and still eyeing his enemies with gentle calm, his\nknees unlocked, his frame trembled, then down he went headlong, his red\nblood running forth in rivulets amongst the wine of oblivion he had\njust poured out.\n\nThere was no time for sentiment.  I shrugged my shoulders, and turning\non my heels, with the woodmen close after me, sprang through the near\ndoorway.  Where was Heru?  I flew down the corridor by which it seemed\nshe had retreated, and then, hesitating a moment where it divided in\ntwo, took the left one.  This to my chagrin presently began to trend\nupwards, whereas I knew Heru was making for the river down below.\n\nBut it was impossible to go back, and whenever I stopped in those\ndeserted passages I could hear the wolflike patter of men's feet upon\nmy trail. On again into the stony labyrinths of the old palace, ever\nupwards, in spite of my desire to go down, until at last, the pursuers\noff the track for a moment, I came to a north window in the palace\nwall, and, hot and breathless, stayed to look out.\n\nAll was peace here; the sky a lovely lavender, a promise of coming\nmorning in it, and a gold-spangled curtain of stars out yonder on the\nhorizon. Not a soul moved.  Below appeared a sheer drop of a hundred\nfeet into a moat winding through thickets of heavy-scented convolvulus\nflowers to the waterways beyond.  And as I looked a skiff with half a\ndozen rowers came swiftly out of the darkness of the wall and passed\nlike a shadow amongst the thickets.  In the prow was all Hath's wedding\nplate, and in the stern, a faint vision of unconscious loveliness, lay\nHeru!\n\nBefore I could lift a finger or call out, even if I had had a mind to\ndo so, the shadow had gone round a bend, and a shout within the palace\ntold me I was sighted again.\n\nOn once more, hotly pursued, until the last corridor ended in two doors\nleading into a half-lit gallery with open windows at the further end.\nThere was a wilderness of lumber down the sides of the great garret,\nand now I come to think of it more calmly I imagine it was Hath's Lost\nProperty Office, the vast receptacle where his slaves deposited\neverything lazy Martians forgot or left about in their daily life. At\nthat moment it only represented a last refuge, and into it I dashed,\nswung the doors to and fastened them just as the foremost of Ar-hap's\nmen hurled themselves upon the barrier from outside.\n\nThere I was like a rat in a trap, and like a rat I made up my mind to\nfight savagely to the end, without for a moment deceiving myself as to\nwhat that end must be.  Even up there the horrible roar of destruction\nwas plainly audible as the barbarians sacked and burned the ancient\ntown, and I was glad from the bottom of my heart my poor little\nprincess was safely out of it.  Nor did I bear her or hers the least\nresentment for making off while there was yet time and leaving me to my\nfate--anything else would have been contrary to Martian nature.\nDoubtless she would get away, as Hath had said, and elsewhere drop a\nfew pearly tears and then over her sugar-candy and lotus-eating forget\nwith happy completeness--most blessed gift!  And meanwhile the foresaid\nbarbarians were battering on my doors, while over their heads choking\nsmoke was pouring in in ever-increasing volumes.\n\nIn burst the first panel, then another, and I could see through the\ngaps a medley of tossing weapons and wild faces without.  Short shrift\nfor me if they came through, so in the obstinacy of desperation I set\nto work to pile old furniture and dry goods against the barricade. And\nas they yelled and hammered outside I screamed back defiance from\nwithin, sweating, tugging, and hauling with the strength of ten men,\npiling up the old Martian lumber against the opening till, so fierce\nwas the attack outside, little was left of the original doorway and\nnothing between me and the besiegers but a rampart of broken woodwork\nhalf seen in a smother of smoke and flames.\n\nStill they came on, thrusting spears and javelins through every crevice\nand my strength began to go.  I threw two tables into a gap, and\nbrained a besieger with a sweetmeat-seller's block and smothered\nanother, and overturned a great chest against my barricade; but what\nwas the purpose of it all?  They were fifty to one and my rampart\nquaked before them. The smoke was stifling, and the pains of\ndissolution in my heart. They burst in and clambered up the rampart\nlike black ants.  I looked round for still one more thing to hurl into\nthe breach.  My eyes lit on a roll of carpet: I seized it by one corner\nmeaning to drag it to the doorway, and it came undone at a touch.\n\nThat strange, that incredible pattern!  Where in all the vicissitudes\nof a chequered career had I seen such a one before?  I stared at it in\namazement under the very spears of the woodmen in the red glare of\nHath's burning palace.  Then all on a sudden it burst upon me that IT\nWAS THE ACCURSED RUG, the very one which in response to a careless wish\nhad swept me out of my own dear world, and forced me to take as wild a\njourney into space as ever fell to a man's lot since the universe was\nmade!\n\nAnd in another second it occurred to me that if it had brought me\nhither it might take me hence.  It was but a chance, yet worth trying\nwhen all other chances were against me.  As Ar-hap's men came shouting\nover the barricade I threw myself down upon that incredible carpet and\ncried from the bottom of my heart,\n\n\"I wish--I wish I were in New York!\"\n\nYes!\n\nA moment of thrilling suspense and then the corners lifted as though a\nstrong breeze were playing upon them.  Another moment and they had\ncurled over like an incoming surge.  One swift glance I got at the\nsmoke and flames, the glittering spears and angry faces, and then fold\nupon fold, a stifling, all-enveloping embrace, a lift, a sense of\nsuper-human speed--and then forgetfulness.\n\nWhen I came to, as reporters say, I was aware the rug had ejected me on\nsolid ground and disappeared, forever.  Where was I!  It was cool,\ndamp, and muddy.  There were some iron railings close at hand and a\nstreet lamp overhead.  These things showed clearly to me, sitting on a\ndoorstep under that light, head in hand, amazed and giddy--so amazed\nthat when slowly the recognition came of the incredible fact my wish\nwas gratified and I was home again, the stupendous incident scarcely\nappealed to my tingling senses more than one of the many others I had\nlately undergone.\n\nVery slowly I rose to my feet, and as like a discreditable reveller as\ncould be, climbed the steps.  The front door was open, and entering the\noh, so familiar hall a sound of voices in my sitting-room on the right\ncaught my ear.\n\n\"Oh no, Mrs. Brown,\" said one, which I recognised at once as my\nPolly's, \"he is dead for certain, and my heart is breaking.  He would\nnever, never have left me so long without writing if he had been\nalive,\" and then came a great sound of sobbing.\n\n\"Bless your kind heart, miss,\" said the voice of my landlady in reply,\n\"but you don't know as much about young gentlemen as I do.  It is not\nlikely, if he has gone off on the razzle-dazzle, as I am sure he has,\nhe is going to write every post and tell you about it.  Now you go off\nto your ma at the hotel like a dear, and forget all about him till he\ncomes back--that's MY advice.\"\n\n\"I cannot, I cannot, Mrs. Brown.  I cannot rest by day or sleep by\nnight for thinking of him; for wondering why he went away so suddenly,\nand for hungering for news of him.  Oh, I am miserable.  Gully!  Gully!\nCome to me,\" and then there were sounds of troubled footsteps pacing to\nand fro and of a woman's grief.\n\nThat was more than I could stand.  I flung the door open, and, dirty,\ndishevelled, with unsteady steps, advanced into the room.\n\n\"Ahem!\" coughed Mrs. Brown, \"just as I expected!\"\n\nBut I had no eyes for her.  \"Polly!  Polly!\" I cried, and that dear\ngirl, after a startled scream and a glance to make sure it was indeed\nthe recovered prodigal, rushed over and threw all her weight of dear,\nwarm, comfortable womanhood into my arms, and the moment after burst\ninto a passion of happy tears down my collar.\n\n\"Humph!\" quoth the landlady, \"that is not what BROWN gets when he\nforgets his self.  No, not by any means.\"\n\nBut she was a good old soul at heart, and, seeing how matters stood,\nwith a parting glance of scorn in my direction and a toss of her head,\nwent out of the room, and closed the door behind her.\n\nNeed I tell in detail what followed?  Polly behaved like an angel, and\nwhen in answer to her gentle reproaches I told her the outlines of my\nmarvellous story she almost believed me!  Over there on the\nwriting-desk lay a whole row of the unopened letters she had showered\nupon me during my absence, and amongst them an official one.  We went\nand opened it together, and it was an intimation of my promotion, a\nmuch better \"step\" than I had ever dared to hope for.\n\nHolding that missive in my hand a thought suddenly occurred to me.\n\n\"Polly dear, this letter makes me able to maintain you as you ought to\nbe maintained, and there is still a fortnight of vacation for me.\nPolly, will you marry me tomorrow?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not, sir.\"\n\n\"Then will you marry me on Monday?\"\n\n\"Do you truly, truly want me to?\"\n\n\"Truly, truly.\"\n\n\"Then, yes,\" and the dear girl again came blushing into my arms.\n\nWhile we were thus the door opened, and in came her parents who were\nstaying at a neighbouring hotel while inquiries were made as to my\nmysterious absence.  Not unnaturally my appearance went a long way to\nconfirm suspicions such as Mrs. Brown had confessed to, and, after they\nhad given me cold salutations, Polly's mother, fixing gold glasses on\nthe bridge of her nose and eyeing me haughtily therefrom, observed,\n\n\"And now that you ARE safely at home again, Lieutenant Gulliver Jones,\nI think I will take my daughter away with me.  Tomorrow her father will\nascertain the true state of her feelings after this unpleasant\nexperience, and subsequently he will no doubt communicate with you on\nthe subject.\" This very icily.\n\nBut I was too happy to be lightly put down.\n\n\"My dear madam,\" I replied, \"I am happy to be able to save her father\nthat trouble.  I have already communicated with this young lady as to\nthe state of her feelings, and as an outcome I am delighted to be able\nto tell you we are to be married on Monday.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Mother, it is true, and if you do not want to make me the most\nmiserable of girls again you will not be unkind to us.\"\n\nIn brief, that sweet champion spoke so prettily and smoothed things so\ncleverly that I was \"forgiven,\" and later on in the evening allowed to\nescort Polly back to her hotel.\n\n\"And oh!\" she said, in her charmingly enthusiastic way when we were\nsaying goodnight, \"you shall write a book about that extraordinary\nstory you told me just now.  Only you must promise me one thing.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"To leave out all about Heru--I don't like that part at all.\"  This\nwith the prettiest little pout.\n\n\"But, Polly dear, see how important she was to the narrative.  I cannot\nquite do that.\"\n\n\"Then you will say as little as you can about her?\"\n\n\"No more than the story compels me to.\"\n\n\"And you are quite sure you like me much the best, and will not go\nafter her again?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\nThe compact was sealed in the most approved fashion; and here,\nindulgent reader, is the artless narrative that resulted--an incident\nso incredible in this prosaic latter-day world that I dare not ask you\nto believe, and must humbly content myself with hoping that if I fail\nto convince yet I may at least claim the consolation of having amused\nyou.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Gulliver of Mars, by Edwin L.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
