CATCH AT UTTERHAY\n\n\n\nWhilom, as tells the tale, was a walled cheaping-town hight Utterhay,\nwhich was builded in a bight of the land a little off the great\nhighway which went from over the mountains to the sea.\n\nThe said town was hard on the borders of a wood, which men held to be\nmighty great, or maybe measureless; though few indeed had entered it,\nand they that had, brought back tales wild and confused thereof.\n\nTherein was neither highway nor byway, nor wood-reeve nor way-warden;\nnever came chapman thence into Utterhay; no man of Utterhay was so\npoor or so bold that he durst raise the hunt therein; no outlaw durst\nflee thereto; no man of God had such trust in the saints that he\ndurst build him a cell in that wood.\n\nFor all men deemed it more than perilous; and some said that there\nwalked the worst of the dead; othersome that the Goddesses of the\nGentiles haunted there; others again that it was the faery rather,\nbut they full of malice and guile.  But most commonly it was deemed\nthat the devils swarmed amidst of its thickets, and that wheresoever\na man sought to, who was once environed by it, ever it was the Gate\nof Hell whereto he came.  And the said wood was called Evilshaw.\n\nNevertheless the cheaping-town throve not ill; for whatso evil things\nhaunted Evilshaw, never came they into Utterhay in such guise that\nmen knew them, neither wotted they of any hurt that they had of the\nDevils of Evilshaw.\n\nNow in the said cheaping-town, on a day, it was market and high noon,\nand in the market-place was much people thronging; and amidst of them\nwent a woman, tall, and strong of aspect, of some thirty winters by\nseeming, black-haired, hook-nosed and hawk-eyed, not so fair to look\non as masterful and proud.  She led a great grey ass betwixt two\npanniers, wherein she laded her marketings.  But now she had done her\nchaffer, and was looking about her as if to note the folk for her\ndisport; but when she came across a child, whether it were borne in\narms or led by its kinswomen, or were going alone, as were some, she\nseemed more heedful of it, and eyed it more closely than aught else.\n\nSo she strolled about till she was come to the outskirts of the\nthrong, and there she happened on a babe of some two winters, which\nwas crawling about on its hands and knees, with scarce a rag upon its\nlittle body.  She watched it, and looked whereto it was going, and\nsaw a woman sitting on a stone, with none anigh her, her face bowed\nover her knees as if she were weary or sorry.  Unto her crept the\nlittle one, murmuring and merry, and put its arms about the woman's\nlegs, and buried its face in the folds of her gown:  she looked up\ntherewith, and showed a face which had once been full fair, but was\nnow grown bony and haggard, though she were scarce past five and\ntwenty years.  She took the child and strained it to her bosom, and\nkissed it, face and hands, and made it great cheer, but ever\nwoefully.  The tall stranger stood looking down on her, and noted how\nevilly she was clad, and how she seemed to have nought to do with\nthat throng of thriving cheapeners, and she smiled somewhat sourly.\n\nAt last she spake, and her voice was not so harsh as might have been\nlooked for from her face:  Dame, she said, thou seemest to be less\nbusy than most folk here; might I crave of thee to tell an alien who\nhas but some hour to dwell in this good town where she may find her a\nchamber wherein to rest and eat a morsel, and be untroubled of\nribalds and ill company?  Said the poor-wife:  Short shall be my\ntale; I am over poor to know of hostelries and ale-houses that I may\ntell thee aught thereof.  Said the other:  Maybe some neighbour of\nthine would take me in for thy sake?  Said the mother:  What\nneighbours have I since my man died; and I dying of hunger, and in\nthis town of thrift and abundance?\n\nThe leader of the ass was silent a while, then she said:  Poor woman!\nI begin to have pity on thee; and I tell thee that luck hath come to\nthee to-day.\n\nNow the poor-wife had stood up with the babe in her arms and was\nturning to go her ways; but the alien put forth a hand to her, and\nsaid:  Stand a while and hearken good tidings.  And she put her hand\nto her girdle-pouch, and drew thereout a good golden piece, a noble,\nand said:  When I am sitting down in thine house thou wilt have\nearned this, and when I take my soles out thereof there will be three\nmore of like countenance, if I be content with thee meanwhile.\n\nThe woman looked on the gold, and tears came into her eyes; but she\nlaughed and said:  Houseroom may I give thee for an hour truly, and\ntherewithal water of the well, and a mouse's meal of bread.  If thou\ndeem that worth three nobles, how may I say thee nay, when they may\nsave the life of my little one.  But what else wouldst thou of me?\nLittle enough, said the alien; so lead me straight to thine house.\n\nSo went they forth of the market-place, and the woman led them, the\nalien and the ass, out of the street through the west gate of\nUtterhay, that, to wit, which looked on Evilshaw, and so into a\nscattering street without the wall, the end of which neared a corner\nof the wood aforesaid:  the houses there were nought so evil of\nfashion, but whereas they were so nigh unto the Devil's Park, rich\nmen might no longer away with them, and they were become wares for\npoor folk.\n\nNow the townswoman laid her hand on the latch of the door that was\nhers, and threw the door open; then she put forth her palm to the\nother, and said:  Wilt thou give me the first gold now, since rest is\nmade sure for thee, as long as thou wilt?  The ass-leader put it into\nher hand, and she took it and laid it on her baby's cheek, and then\nkissed both gold and child together; then she turned to the alien and\nsaid:  As for thy way-beast, I have nought for him, neither hay nor\ncorn:  thou wert best to leave him in the street.  The stranger\nnodded a yeasay, and the three went in together, the mother, the\nchild, and the alien.\n\nNot right small was the chamber; but there was little therein; one\nstool to wit, a yew-chair, a little table, and a coffer:  there was\nno fire on the hearth, nought save white ashes of small wood; but it\nwas June, so that was of no account.\n\nThe guest sat down in the yew-chair, and the poor-wife laid her child\ndown gently on the floor and came and stood before the stranger, as\nif abiding her bidding.\n\nSpake the alien:  Nought so uncomely or strait is thy chamber; and\nthy child, which I see is a woman, and therefore belike shall long\nabide with thee, is lovely of shape, and fair of flesh.  Now also\nthou shalt have better days, as I deem, and I pray them on thine\nhead.\n\nShe spake in a kind wheedling voice, and the poor-wife's face grew\nsofter, and presently tears fell down on to the table from her, but\nshe spake no word.  The guest now drew forth, not three nobles, but\nfour, and laid them on the table, and said:  Lo, my friend, the three\nnobles which I behight thee! now are they thine; but this other thou\nshalt take and spend for me.  Go up into the town, and buy for me\nwhite bread of the best; and right good flesh, or poulaine if it may\nbe, already cooked and dight; and, withal, the best wine that thou\nmayst get, and sweetmeats for thy baby; and when thou comest back, we\nwill sit together and dine here.  And thereafter, when we be full of\nmeat and drink, we shall devise something more for thy good speed.\n\nThe woman knelt before her weeping, but might speak no word because\nof the fullness of her heart.  She kissed the guest's hands, and took\nthe money, and then arose and caught up her child, and kissed her\nbare flesh eagerly many times, and then hastened out of the house and\nup the street and through the gate; and the guest sat hearkening to\nthe sound of her footsteps till it died out, and there was nought to\nbe heard save the far-off murmur of the market, and the chirrup of\nthe little one on the floor.\n\nThen arose the guest and took up the child from the floor, who kicked\nand screamed, and craved her mother as her broken speech might; but\nthe alien spake softly to her, and said:  Hush, dear one, and be\ngood, and we will go and find her; and she gave her therewith a\nsugar-plum from out of her scrip.  Then she came out of doors, and\nspake sweetly to the little one:  See now this pretty way-beast.  We\nwill ride merrily on him to find thy mother.\n\nThen she laid the child in the pannier with a soft cushion under, and\na silk cloth over her, so that she lay there happily.  Then she took\nher ass's rein and went her ways over the waste toward Evilshaw; for,\nas ye may deem, where the houses and the street ended, the beaten way\nended also.\n\nQuietly and speedily she went, and met but three men on the way; and\nwhen these saw her, and that she was making for Evilshaw, they turned\ntheir heads away, each one, and blessed themselves, and went past\nswiftly.  Not one sought to stay her, or held any converse with her,\nand no foot she heard following after her.  So in scarce more than\nthe saying of a low mass she was in amongst the trees, with her ass\nand her wares and her prey.\n\nNo stay she made there, but held forward at her best before the night\nshould fall upon her.  And whatsoever might be told concerning the\ncreatures that other folk had met in Evilshaw, of her it must needs\nbe said that therein she happened on nought worser than herself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  NOW SHALL BE TOLD OF THE HOUSE BY THE WATER-SIDE\n\n\n\nFour days they wended the wood, and nought befell to tell of.  The\nwitch-wife (for even such was she) fed the stolen child well and\nduly, and whiles caressed her and spake sweetly unto her; whiles also\nshe would take her out of the pannier, and set her on the ass's back\nand hold her thereon heedfully; or, otherwhiles, when they came upon\ngrassy and flowery places, she would set her down on the ground and\nlet her roam about, and pluck the flowers and the strawberries.  And\nwhoso might be sorry, the child was glad, so many things new and fair\nas she came upon.\n\nAt last, when the fifth day was waning, and they had been a long\nwhile wending a wood set thick with trees, it began to grow grey\nbetwixt the distant boles, and then from grey to white, and it was as\nif a new world of light lay before them.  Thitherward went they, and\nin a little, and before the sun was set, came they to the shore of a\ngreat water, and thence was no more land to be seen before them than\nif it had been the main sea itself, though this was a sweet water.\nAlbeit, less than a half mile from the shore lay two eyots, as it\nmight have been on the salt sea; but one of these sat low down on the\nwater, and was green and well bushed, but the other, which lay east\nof it, and was nigher to the shore, was high, rocky, and barren.\n\nNow the ending of the wood left a fair green plain betwixt it and the\nwater, whiles more than a furlong across, whiles much less; and\nwhiles the trees came down close to the water-side.  But the place\nwhereas they came from out the wood was of the widest, and there it\nwas a broad bight of greensward of the fashion of the moon seven\nnights old, and a close hedge of thicket there was at the back of it;\nand the lake lay south, and the wood north.  Some deal of this\ngreensward was broken by closes of acre-land, and the tall green\nwheat stood blossoming therein; but the most was sweet meadow, and\nthere as now was a gallant flock of goats feeding down it; five kine\nwithal, and a tethered bull.  Through the widest of this meadow ran a\nclear stream winding down to the lake, and on a little knoll beside a\nlap of the said stream, two bow-shots from the water, was a knoll,\nwhereon stood, amidst of a potherb garden, a little house strongly\nframed of timber.  Before it the steep bank of the lake broke down\ninto a slowly-shelving beach, whose honey-coloured sand thrust up a\ntongue in amongst the grass of the mead.\n\nWent the witch-wife straight to the door of the said house as if she\nwere at home, as was sooth indeed.  She threw the door open, and\nunladed the ass of all his wares, and first of the youngling, whom\nshe shook awake, and bore into the house, and laid safely on the\nfloor of the chamber; nor did she wait on her wailing, but set about\nwhat was to be done to kindle fire, and milk a she-goat, and get meat\nupon the board.  That did she, and fed both herself and the child\nplenteously:  neither did she stint her of meat ever, from that time\nforward, however else she dealt with her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  OF SKIN-CHANGING\n\n\n\nOne thing must here be told:  Whenas the said dame stood forth clad\namidst of the chamber the next morning, the child ran up to her to\ngreet her or what not, but straightway when she saw her close, drew\naback, and stood gasping with affright; for verily she deemed this\nwas nowise she who had brought her last night into the fair chamber,\nand given bread and milk to her and put her to bed, but someone else.\nFor this one had not dark hair, and hooked nose, and eyen hawk-\nbright; stark and tall was she indeed, as that other one, and by\nseeming of the same-like age; but there came to an end all her\nlikeness to last night's housewife.  This one had golden-red hair\nflowing down from her head; eyes of hazel colour, long and not well-\nopened, but narrow and sly.  High of cheekbones she was, long-chinned\nand thin-lipped; her skin was fine and white, but without ruddiness;\nflat-breasted she was, and narrow-hipped.\n\nNow she laughed at the babe's terror, and said, but in her old voice\nat least:  Thou foolish little beast!  I know what scares thee, to\nwit, that thou deemest me changed:  now I tell thee that I am the one\nwho brought thee here last night, and fed thee; neither is my\nchanging a matter of thine, since at least I am the one who shall\nkeep thee from hunger and weather henceforward; that is enough for\nthee to know as now.  Now thou hast to eat and sleep and play and cry\nout, that thou mayest the sooner wax, and grow into the doing of my\nwill.\n\nTherewith she led her out into the sunshine, and tethered her to an\nash sapling which grew anigh the door, that the child might be safe\nthe while she went about her work in acre and mead.\n\nBut as for that matter of changing of aspect, the maiden came to know\nthereafter that the witch durst not go into the wood in the same skin\nas that which she wore at home, wherefore she had changed it for the\njourney to Utterhay, and changed back again in the night-tide before\nshe arose.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  OF THE WAXING OF THE STOLEN CHILD\n\n\n\nThis little one, who is henceforth called Birdalone, though the witch\ncalled her but seldom so, nor indeed by any name, dwelt there betwixt\nthe water and the wood, and saw none save the said witch-wife, who,\nas aforesaid, fed her well, but scarce meddled with her else for a\nlong while; so she wandered well-nigh as she had will, and much in\nthe wood; for she had no fear thereof, nor indeed of aught else save\nof the dame.  She learned of the ways and the wont of all the\ncreatures round about her, and the very grass and flowers were\nfriends to her, and she made tales of them in her mind; and the wild\nthings feared her in no wise, and the fowl would come to her hand,\nand play with her and love her.  A lovely child she was, rosy and\nstrong, and as merry as the birds on the bough; and had she trouble,\nfor whiles she came across some ugly mood of the witch-wife, she bore\nit all as lightly as they.\n\nWore the years thus, till now she was grown tall and thin, and had\nseen twelve winters, and was far stronger and handier than at first\nsight she looked to be.  That found her mistress, and would not\nforego the using of her deftness.  For indeed the maiden knew all\nmatters of wood and field full well, and somewhat of the water also\n(though no boat had she ever seen there), for she learned herself\nswimming, as the ducks do belike.\n\nBut now her mistress would learn her swinking, and hard was the\nlesson, for with twiggen rods and switches was she learned, and was\nsomewhat stubborn with this woman, who she deemed loved her not; and,\nhowever it were, there began to grow in her an inkling that all was\nnot well with the dame, and howsoever she might fear her, she trusted\nher not, nor worshipped her; otherwise she had learned her lesson\nspeedily; for she was not slack nor a sluggard, and hated not the\ntoil, even when it pained and wearied her, but against the anger and\nmalice she hardened her heart.\n\nIt is to be said, that though there she dwelt alone with the witch-\nwife, she had somehow got to know that they two were not alone in the\nworld, and she knew of male and female, and young and old.  Thereof\ndoubtless the witch herself had learned her, would she, would she\nnot; for though she were mostly few-spoken, yet whiles the tongue of\nher would loosen, and she would tell Birdalone tales of men and\nwomen, and kings and warriors and thralls, and the folk of the world\nbeyond them, if it were but to scare the child.  Yea, and when she\nrated Birdalone, or girded at her, words would come forth which the\nmaiden stored up, and by laying two and two together gat wisdom howso\nit were.  Moreover, she was of the race of Adam, and her heart\nconceived of diverse matters from her mother's milk and her father's\nblood, and her heart and her mind grew up along with her body.\nHerein also was she wise, to wit, how to give wrath the go-by, so\nthat she oft found the wood a better home than the house:  for now\nshe knew that the witch-wife would enter it never; wherefore she\nloved it much, and haunted it daily if she might.\n\nAmidst all this she lived not unmerrily; for the earth was her\nfriend, and solaced her when she had suffered aught:  withal she was\nsoon grown hardy as well as strong; and evil she could thole, nor let\nit burden her with misery.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  OF BIRDALONE, AND HOW SHE IS GROWN INTO MAIDENHOOD\n\n\n\nWear the years and the years amidst such days as these, and now is\nBirdalone grown a dear maiden of seventeen summers; and yet was her\nlife not unhappy; though the mirth of her childhood was somewhat\nchastened in her, and she walked the earth soberly and measurely, as\nthough deep thoughts were ever in her head:  though, forsooth, it is\nnot all so sure that her serious face and solemn eyes were but a part\nof the beauty which was growing with the coming forth of childhood\ninto youth and maidenhood.  But this at least is sure, that about\nthis time those forebodings which had shown her that she had no call\nto love and honour her mistress took clearer shape, and became a\nburden on her, which she might never wholly shake off.  For this she\nsaw, that she was not her own, but a chattel and a tool of one who\nnot only used her as a thrall in the passing day, but had it in her\nmind to make of her a thing accursed like to herself, and to bait the\ntrap with her for the taking of the sons of Adam.  Forsooth she saw,\nthough dimly, that her mistress was indeed wicked, and that in the\nbonds of that wickedness was she bound.\n\nOne thing, moreover, had she noted now this long while, that once and\nagain, it might be once every two moons, the witch-wife would arise\nin the dead of night and go forth from the house, and be away for a\nday, or two or three, or whiles more, and come back again weary and\nfordone; but never said she any word to Birdalone hereof.  Yet oft\nwhen she arose to go this errand, before she left the chamber would\nshe come to Birdalone's truckle-bed, and stand over her to note if\nshe were asleep or not; and ever at such times did Birdalone feign\nslumber amidst of sickening dread.  Forsooth in these latter days it\nwhiles entered the maiden's head that when the dame was gone she\nwould rise and follow her and see whither she went, and what she did;\nbut terror constrained her that she went not.\n\nNow from amidst all these imaginings arose a hope in her that she\nmight one day escape from her thralldom:  and whiles, when she was\nlonely and safe in the wood, to this hope she yielded herself; but\nthereof came such tumult of her soul for joy of the hope, that she\nmight not master her passion; the earth would seem to rise beneath\nher, and the woods to whirl about before her eyes, so that she might\nnot keep her feet, but would sink adown to earth, and lie there\nweeping.  Then most oft would come the cold fit after the hot, and\nthe terror would take her that some day the witch would surprise the\njoy of that hope in her eyes, and would know what it meant, or that\nsome light word might bewray her; and therewith came imaginings of\nwhat would then befall her, nor were that hard to picture, and it\nwould come before her over and over again till she became weary and\nworn out therewith.\n\nBut though they abode ever with her, these troubling thoughts pricked\nnot so oft at the keenest, but were as the dull ache of little import\nthat comes after pain overcome:  for in sooth busy and toilsome days\ndid she wear, which irked her in nowise, since it eased her of the\ntorment of those hopes and fears aforesaid, and brought her sound\nsleep and sweet awaking.  The kine and the goats must she milk, and\nplough and sow and reap the acre-land according to the seasons, and\nlead the beasts to the woodland pastures when their own were flooded\nor burned; she must gather the fruits of the orchard, and the hazel\nnuts up the woodlands, and beat the walnut-trees in September.  She\nmust make the butter and the cheese, grind the wheat in the quern,\nmake and bake the bread, and in all ways earn her livelihood hard\nenough.  Moreover, the bowman's craft had she learned, and at the\ndame's bidding must fare alone into the wood now and again to slay\nbig deer and little, and win venison:  but neither did that irk her\nat all, for rest and peace were in the woods for her.\n\nTrue it is, that as she wended thicket or glade or wood-lawn, she\nwould at whiles grow timorous, and tread light and heedfully, lest\nrustling leaves or crackling stick should arouse some strange\ncreature in human shape, devil, or god now damned, or woman of the\nfaery.  But if such were there, either they were wise and would not\nbe seen, or kind and had no will to scare the simple maiden; or else\nmaybe there were none such in those days.  Anyhow, nought evil came\nto her out of Evilshaw.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.  HEREIN IS TOLD OF BIRDALONE'S RAIMENT\n\n\n\nLank and long is Birdalone the sweet, with legs that come forth bare\nand browned from under her scant grey coat and scantier smock\nbeneath, which was all her raiment save when the time was bitter, and\nthen, forsooth, it was a cloak of goat-skin that eked her attire:\nfor the dame heeded little the clothing of her; nor did Birdalone\ngive so much heed thereto that she cared to risk the anger of her\nmistress by asking her for aught.\n\nBut on a day of this same spring, when the witch-wife was of sweeter\ntemper than her wont was, and the day was very warm and kindly,\nthough it was but one of the last of February days, Birdalone,\nblushing and shamefaced, craved timidly some more womanly attire.\nBut the dame turned gruffly on her and said:  Tush, child! what\nneedeth it? here be no men to behold thee.  I shall see to it, that\nwhen due time comes thou shalt be whitened and sleeked to the very\nutmost.  But look thou! thou art a handy wench; take the deer-skin\nthat hangs up yonder and make thee brogues for thy feet, if so thou\nwilt.\n\nEven so did Birdalone, and shaped the skin to her feet; but as she\nwas sewing them a fancy came into her head; for she had just come\nacross some threads of silk of divers colours; so she took them and\nher shoon and her needle up into the wood, and there sat down happily\nunder a great spreading oak which much she haunted, and fell to\nbroidering the kindly deer-skin.  And she got to be long about it,\nand came back to it the next day and the next, and many days, whenso\nher servitude would suffer it, and yet the shoon were scarce done.\n\nSo on a morning the dame looked on her feet as she moved about the\nchamber, and cried out at her:  What! art thou barefoot as an hen\nyet?  Hast thou spoilt the good deer-skin and art yet but shoeless?\nNay, our lady, said Birdalone, but the shoon are not altogether done.\nShow them to me, said the dame.\n\nBirdalone went to her little coffer to fetch them, and brought them\nsomewhat timorously, for she knew not how her mistress would take her\nworking on them so long, if perchance she would blame her, or it\nmight be chastise her, for even in those days the witch-wife's hand\nwas whiles raised against her.  But now when the dame took the shoes\nand looked on them, and saw how there were oak-leaves done into them,\nand flowers, and coneys, and squirrels, she but smiled somewhat\ngrimly on Birdalone, and said:  Well, belike thou art a fool to waste\nthy time and mine in such toys; and to give thee thy due would be to\ngive thee stripes.  But thou doest herein after the nature of earthly\nwomen, to adorn thy body, whatsoever else is toward.  And well is\nthat, since I would have thee a woman so soon as may be; and I will\nhelp thy mind for finery, since thou art so deft with thy needle.\n\nTherewith she went to the big coffer and drew forth thence a piece of\nfine green cloth, and another of fine linen, and said to Birdalone:\nThis mayest thou take, and make thee a gown thereof and a new smock,\nand make them if thou wilt as gay as thy new shoon are gotten to be;\nand here is wherewithal.  And therewith she gave her two handfuls of\nsilken threads and gold, and said:  Now I suppose that I must do the\nmore part of thy work, while thou art making thee these gaudy\ngarments.  But maybe someone may be coming this way ere long, who\nwill deem the bird the finer for her fine feathers.  Now depart from\nme; for I would both work for thee and me, and ponder weighty\nmatters.\n\nWho was glad now but Birdalone; she grew red with new pleasure, and\nknelt down and kissed the witch's hand, and then went her ways to the\nwood with her precious lading, and wrought there under her oak-tree\nday after day, and all days, either there, or in the house when the\nweather was foul.  That was in the middle of March, when all birds\nwere singing, and the young leaves showing on the hawthorns, so that\nthere were pale green clouds, as it were, betwixt the great grey\nboles of oak and sweet-chestnut; and by the lake the meadow-saffron\nnew-thrust-up was opening its blossom; and March wore and April, and\nstill she was at work happily when now it was later May, and the\nhare-bells were in full bloom down the bent before her.\n\nAll this while the witch had meddled little with Birdalone, and had\nbidden her to no work afield or in the stead which was anywise\ngrievous, but had done all herself; yet was she few-spoken with her,\nand would oft behold her gloomily.  And one evening when Birdalone\ncame in from the wood, the witch came close up to her and stared her\nin the face, and said suddenly:  Is it in thine heart to flee away\nfrom me and leave me?\n\nA sharp pang of fear shot through Birdalone's heart at that word, and\nshe turned very red, and then pale to the lips, but stammered out:\nNo, lady, it is not in mine heart.  The dame looked grimly on her and\nsaid:  If thou try it and fail, thou shalt rue it once only, to wit,\nlifelong; and thou canst but fail.  She was silent a while, and then\nspake in a milder voice:  Be content here a while with me, and\nthereafter thou shalt be more content, and that before long.\n\nShe said no more at that time; but her word clave to Birdalone's\nheart, and for some time thereafter she was sorely oppressed with a\nburden of fear, and knew not how to hold herself before the witch-\nwife.  But the days wore, and nought betid, and the maiden's heart\ngrew lighter, and still she wrought on at her gown and her smock, and\nit was well-nigh done.  She had broidered the said gown with roses\nand lilies, and a tall tree springing up from amidmost the hem of the\nskirt, and a hart on either side thereof, face to face of each other.\nAnd the smock she had sewn daintily at the hems and the bosom with\nfair knots and buds.  It was now past the middle of June, hot and\nbright weather.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.  BIRDALONE HATH AN ADVENTURE IN THE WOOD\n\n\n\nOn a day she went to the wood, and sat down under her oak-tree, and\nit was far and far out of sight of anyone standing in the meadow by\nthe lake; and in the wood Birdalone looked to see nought at all save\nthe rabbits and squirrels, who were, forsooth, familiar enough with\nher, and fearless, so that they would come to her hand and sport with\nher when she hailed them.  Wherefore, as the day was exceeding hot,\nshe put off from her her simple raiment, that she might feel all the\npleasure of the cool shadow and what air was stirring, and the\nkindness of the greensward upon her very body.  So she sat sewing,\ncovered but by a lap of the green gown which her needle was painting.\n\nBut as she sat there intent on her work, and her head bent over it,\nand it was now at the point of high noon, she heard as if some\ncreature were going anigh to her; she heeded it not, deeming that it\nwould be but some wandering hind.  But even therewith she heard one\nsay her name in a soft voice, and she leapt up trembling, deeming at\nfirst that it would be the witch come to fetch her:  but yet more\nscared she was, when she saw standing before her the shape of a young\nwoman as naked as herself, save that she had an oak wreath round\nabout her loins.\n\nThe new-comer, who was now close to her, smiled on her, and said in a\nkind and sweet voice:  Fear nought, Birdalone, for I deem thou wilt\nfind me a friend, and it is not unlike that thou wilt need one ere\nlong.  And furthermore, I will say it, said she smiling, that since I\nam not afraid of thee, thou needest not be afraid of me.  Said\nBirdalone, she also smiling:  True it is that thou art nought\nfearsome to look on.  The new-comer laughed outright, and said:  Are\nwe not well met then in the wildwood? and we both as two children\nwhom the earth loveth.  So play we at a game.  At what game? said\nBirdalone.  Spake she of the oak-wreath:  This; thou shalt tell me\nwhat I am like in thine eyes first, because thou wert afraid of me;\nand then when thou art done, I will tell thee what thou seemest to\nme.\n\nQuoth Birdalone:  For me that will be hard; for I have nought to\nliken thee to, whereas save this sight of thee I have seen nought\nsave her that dwelleth in the House by the Water, and whom I serve.\nNay, said the other, then will I begin, and tell thee first whatlike\nthou art, so that thou wilt know the better how to frame thy word\nconcerning me.  But tell me, hast thou ever seen thyself in a mirror?\nWhat thing is that? said Birdalone.  It is a polished round of steel\nor some other white metal, said the wood-maiden, which giveth back in\nall truth the image of whatso cometh before it.  Said Birdalone and\nreddened therewith:  We have at home a broad latten dish, which it is\nmy work, amongst other things, to brighten and keep bright; yet may I\nnot make it so bright that I may see much of mine image therein; and\nyet.  What wouldst thou? said the wood-woman.  Said Birdalone:  I\nshall tell thee presently when thy part of the play is done.\n\nLaughed the new-comer, and said:  It is well; now am I to be thy\nmirror.  Thus it is with thee:  thou standest before me a tall and\nslim maiden, somewhat thin, as befitteth thy seventeen summers; where\nthy flesh is bare of wont, as thy throat and thine arms and thy legs\nfrom the middle down, it is tanned a beauteous colour, but otherwhere\nit is even as fair a white, wholesome and clean, and as if the golden\nsunlight, which fulfilleth the promise of the earth, were playing\ntherein.  Fairer and rounder shall be thine arms and thy shoulders\nwhen thou hast seen five more summers, yet scarce more lovesome, so\nstrong and fine as now they are.  Low are thy breasts, as is meet for\nso young a maiden, yet is there no lack in them; nor ever shall they\nbe fairer than now they are.  In goodly fashion sits thine head upon\nthy shoulders, upheld by a long and most well-wrought neck, that the\nsun hath tanned as aforesaid.  The hair of thee is simple brown, yet\nsomewhat more golden than dark; and ah! now thou lettest it loose it\nwaveth softly past thy fair smooth forehead and on to thy shoulders,\nand is not stayed by thy girdlestead, but hideth nought of thy knees,\nand thy legs shapely thin, and thy strong and clean-wrought ankles\nand feet, which are with thee as full of thine heart and thy soul and\nas wise and deft as be thy wrists and thine hands, and their very\nfellows.  Now as to thy face:  under that smooth forehead is thy\nnose, which is of measure, neither small nor great, straight, and\nlovely carven at the nostrils:  thine eyen are as grey as a hawk's,\nbut kind and serious, and nothing fierce nor shifting.  Nay, now thou\nlettest thine eyelids fall, it is as fair with thy face as if they\nwere open, so smooth and simple are they and with their long full\nlashes.  But well are thine eyen set in thine head, wide apart, well\nopened, and so as none shall say thou mayst not look in the face of\nthem.  Thy cheeks shall one day be a snare for the unwary, yet are\nthey not fully rounded, as some would have them; but not I, for most\npitiful kind are they forsooth.  Delicate and clear-made is the\nlittle trench that goeth from thy nose to thy lips, and sweet it is,\nand there is more might in it than in sweet words spoken.  Thy lips,\nthey are of the finest fashion, yet rather thin than full; and some\nwould not have it so; but I would, whereas I see therein a sign of\nthy valiancy and friendliness.  Surely he who did thy carven chin had\na mind to a master-work and did no less.  Great was the deftness of\nthine imaginer, and he would have all folk that see thee wonder at\nthy deep thinking and thy carefulness and thy kindness.  Ah maiden!\nis it so that thy thoughts are ever deep and solemn?  Yet at least I\nknow it of thee that they be hale and true and sweet.\n\nMy friend, when thou hast a mirror, some of all this shalt thou see,\nbut not all; and when thou hast a lover some deal wilt thou hear, but\nnot all.  But now thy she-friend may tell it thee all, if she have\neyes to see it, as have I; whereas no man could say so much of thee\nbefore the mere love should overtake him, and turn his speech into\nthe folly of love and the madness of desire.  So now I have played\nthe play, and told thee of thee; tell me now of me, and play thy\nplay.\n\nFor a while stood Birdalone silent, blushing and confused, but whiles\ncasting shy glances at her own body, what she might see of it.  At\nlast she spake:  Fair friend, I would do thy will, but I am not deft\nof speech; for I speak but little, save with the fowl and wild\nthings, and they may not learn me the speech of man.  Yet I will say\nthat I wonder to hear thee call me fair and beauteous; for my dame\ntells me that never, nor sayeth aught of my aspect save in her anger,\nand then it is:  Rag! and bag-of-bones! and when wilt thou be a\nwoman, thou lank elf thou?  The new-comer laughed well-favouredly\nhereat, and put forth a hand, and stroked her friend's cheek.\nBirdalone looked piteous kind on her and said:  But now I must needs\nbelieve thy words, thou who art so kind to me, and withal thyself so\nbeauteous.  And I will tell thee that it fills my heart with joy to\nknow that I am fair like to thee.  For this moreover I will tell\nthee, that I have seen nought in field or woodland that is as lovely\nto me as thou art; nay, not the fritillary nodding at our brook's\nmouth, nor the willow-boughs waving on Green Eyot; nor the wild-cat\nsporting on the little woodlawn, when she saw me not; nor the white\ndoe rising up from the grass to look to her fawn; nor aught that\nmoves and grows.  Yet there is another thing which I must tell thee,\nto wit, that what thou hast said about the fashion of any part of me,\nthat same, setting aside thy lovely words, which make the tears come\ninto the eyes of me, would I say of thee.  Look thou!  I take thine\nhair and lay the tress amongst mine, and thou mayst not tell which is\nwhich; and amidst the soft waves of it thy forehead is nestling\nsmooth as thou saidst of mine:  hawk-grey and wide apart are thine\neyen, and deep thought and all tenderness is in them, as of me thou\nsayest:  fine is thy nose and of due measure; and thy cheeks a little\nhollow, and somewhat thin thy lovely lips; and thy round chin so\ngoodly carven, as it might not be better done.  And of thy body else\nI will say as thou sayst of mine, though I deem these hands have done\nmore work than thine.  But see thou! thy leg and mine as they stand\ntogether; and thine arm, as if it were of my body.  Slim and slender\nthou art, or it may be lank; and I deem our dame would call thee also\nbag-of-bones.  Now is this strange.  Who art thou?  Art thou my very\nown sister?  I would thou wert.\n\nSpake then to Birdalone that image of her, and said, smiling kindly\non her:  As to our likeness, thou hast it now; so alike are we, as if\nwe were cast in one mould.  But thy sister of blood I am not; nay, I\nwill tell thee at once that I am not of the children of Adam.  As to\nwhat I am, that is a long story, and I may not tell it as now; but\nthou mayst call me Habundia, as I call thee Birdalone.  Now it is\ntrue that to everyone I show not myself in this fair shape of thee;\nbut be not aghast thereat, or deem me like unto thy mistress herein,\nfor as now I am, so ever shall I be unto thee.\n\nQuoth Birdalone, looking on her anxiously:  Yea, and I shall see thee\nagain, shall I not? else should I grieve, and wish that I had never\nseen thee at all.  Yea, forsooth, said Habundia, for I myself were\nmost fain to see thee oft.  But now must thou presently get thee back\nhome, for evil as now is the mood of thy mistress, and she is rueing\nthe gift of the green gown, and hath in her mind to seek occasion to\nchastise thee.\n\nNow was Birdalone half weeping, as she did on her raiment while her\nfriend looked on her kindly.  She said presently:  Habundia, thou\nseest I am hard bestead; give me some good rede thereto.\n\nThat will I, said the wood-wife.  When thou goest home to the house,\nbe glad of countenance, and joyous that thy gown is nigh done; and\ntherewith be exceeding wary.  For I deem it most like that she will\nask thee what thou hast seen in the wood, and then if thou falter, or\nthy face change, then she will have an inkling of what hath befallen,\nto wit, that thou hast seen someone; and then will she be minded to\nquestion thy skin.  But if thou keep countenance valiantly, then\npresently will her doubt run off her, and she will cease grudging,\nand will grow mild with thee and meddle not.  This is the first rede,\nand is for to-day; and now for the second, which is for days yet\nunborn.  Thou hast in thy mind to flee away from her; and even so\nshalt thou do one day, though it may be by way of Weeping Cross; for\nshe is sly and wise and grim, though sooth it is that she hateth thee\nnot utterly.  Now thou must note that nowise she hindereth thee from\nfaring in this wood, and that is because she wotteth, as I do, that\nby this way there is no outgoing for thee.  Wherefore look thou to it\nthat it is by the way of the water that thou shalt fare to the land\nof men-folk.  Belike this may seem marvellous to thee; but so it is;\nand belike I may tell thee more hereof when time serveth.  Now cometh\nthe last word of my rede.  Maybe if thou come often to the wood, we\nshall whiles happen on each other; but if thou have occasion for me,\nand wouldst see me at once, come hither, and make fire, and burn a\nhair of my head therein, and I will be with thee:  here is for thee a\ntress of mine hair; now thou art clad, thou mayst take a knife from\nthy pouch and shear it from off me.\n\nEven so did Birdalone, and set the tress in her pouch; and therewith\nthey kissed and embraced each other, and Birdalone went her ways home\nto the house, but Habundia went back into the wood as she had come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.  OF BIRDALONE AND THE WITCH-WIFE\n\n\n\nIt went with Birdalone as Habundia had foretold, for she came home to\nthe house glad of semblance, flushed and light-foot, so that she was\nlovely and graceful beyond her wont.  The dame looked on her\ndoubtfully and grimly a while, and then she said:  What ails thee, my\nservant, that thou lookest so masterful?  Nought ails me, lady, said\nBirdalone, save that I am gay because of the summer season, and\nchiefly because of thy kindness and thy gift, and that I have well-\nnigh done my work thereon, and that soon now I shall feel these\ndainty things beating about my ankles.  And she held up and spread\nabroad the skirt with her two hands, and it was indeed goodly to look\non.\n\nThe witch-wife snorted scornfully and scowled on her, and said:\nThine ankles forsooth!  Bag-o'-bones! thou wisp! forsooth, thou art\nin love with thy looks, though thou knowest not what like a fair\nwoman is.  Forsooth, I begin to think that thou wilt never grow into\na woman at all, but will abide a skinny elf thy life long.  Belike I\ndid myself wrong to suffer thee to waste these three or four months\nof thy thrall's work, since for nought but thrall's work shalt thou\never be meet.\n\nBirdalone hung her head adown, and blushed, but smiled a little, and\nswayed her body gently, as a willow-bough is swayed when a light air\narises in the morning.  But the witch stood so scowling on her, and\nwith so sour a look, that Birdalone, glancing at her, found her heart\nsink so within her, that she scarce kept countenance; yet she lost it\nnot.\n\nThen said the witch sharply:  Wert thou in the wood to-day?  Yea,\nlady, said the maiden.  Then said the dame fiercely:  And what sawest\nthou?  Quoth Birdalone, looking up with an innocent face somewhat\nscared:  Lady, I saw a bear, one of the big ones, crossing a glade.\nAnd thou without bow and arrow or wood-knife, I warrant me, said the\nwitch.  Thou shalt be whipped, to keep thee in mind that thy life is\nmine and not thine.  Nay, nay, I pray thee be not wroth! said the\nmaid; he was a long way down the glade, and would not have followed\nme if he had seen me:  there was no peril therein.  Said the witch-\nwife:  Didst thou see aught else?  Yea, said Birdalone, and was\nweeping somewhat now; which forsooth was not hard for her to do,\nover-wrought as she was betwixt hope and fear:  yea, I saw my white\ndoe and her fawn, and they passed close by me; and two herons flew\nover my head toward the water; and . . .  But the witch turned\nsharply and said:  Thrall! hast thou seen a woman to-day in the wood?\nA woman? said Birdalone, and what woman, my lady, said Birdalone.\nHath any woman come to the house, and passed forth into the wood?\n\nThe dame looked on her carefully, and remembered how she had faltered\nand changed countenance that other day, when she had charged her with\nbeing minded to flee; and now she saw her with wondering face, and in\nno wise confused or afraid of guilt, as it seemed; so she believed\nher tale, and being the more at ease thereby, her wrath ran off her,\nand she spake altogether pleasantly to Birdalone, and said:  Now I\nhave had my gird at thee, my servant, I must tell thee that in sooth\nit is not all for nothing that thou hast had these months of rest;\nfor verily thou hast grown more of a woman thereby, and hast\nsleekened and rounded much.  Albeit, the haysel will wait no longer\nfor us, and the day after to-morrow we must fall to on it.  But when\nthat is done, thou shalt be free to do thy green gown, or what thou\nwilt, till wheat harvest is toward; and thereafter we shall see to\nit.  Or what sayest thou?\n\nBirdalone wondered somewhat at this so gracious word, but not much;\nfor in her heart now was some guile born to meet the witch's guile;\nso she knelt down and took the dame's hands and kissed them, and\nsaid:  I say nought, lady, save that I thank thee over and over again\nthat thou art become so good to me; and that I will full merrily work\nfor thee in the hay-field, or at whatsoever else thou wilt.\n\nAnd indeed she was so light-hearted that she had so escaped from the\nhand of the witch for that time, and above all, that she had gotten a\nfriend so kind and dear as the wood-woman, that her heart went out\neven toward her mistress, so that she went nigh to loving her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.  OF BIRDALONE'S SWIMMING\n\n\n\nFull fair was the morrow morn, and Birdalone arose betimes before the\nsun was up, and she thought she would make of this a holiday before\nthe swink afield began again, since the witch was grown good toward\nher.  So she did on her fair shoes, and her new raiment, though the\ngreen gown was not fully done, and said to herself that she would\nconsider what she would do with her holiday when she was amidst of\nher bathing.\n\nSo she went down to the water-side, and when she was standing knee-\ndeep in the little sandy bight aforesaid, she looked over to Green\nEyot, and was minded to swim over thither, as oft she did.  And it\nwas a windless dawn after a hot night, and a light mist lay upon the\nface of the water, and above it rose the greenery of the eyot.\n\nShe pushed off into the deep and swam strongly through the still\nwater, and the sun rose while she was on the way, and by then she had\nlaid a hand on the willow-twigs of the eyot, was sending a long beam\nacross the waters; and her wet shoulders rose up into the path of it\nand were turned into ruddy gold.  She hoisted herself up, and\nclimbing the low bank, was standing amongst the meadow-sweet, and\ndripping on to its fragrance.  Then she turned about to the green\nplain and the house and the hedge of woodland beyond, and sighed, and\nsaid softly:  A pity of it, to leave it!  If it were no better\notherwhere, and not so fair?\n\nThen she turned inward to the eyot, which had done her nought but\ngood, and which she loved; and she unbound her hair, and let it fall\ntill the ends of the tresses mingled with the heads of the meadow-\nsweet, and thereafter walked quietly up into the grassy middle of the\nisle.\n\nShe was wont to go to a knoll there where the grass was fine, and\nflowery at this time with white clover and dog violet, and lie down\nunder the shade of a big thorn with a much-twisted bole:  but to-day\nsome thought came across her, and she turned before she came to the\nthorn, and went straight over the eyot (which was but a furlong over\nat that place) and down to the southward-looking shore thereof.\nThere she let herself softly down into the water and thrust off\nwithout more ado, and swam on and on till she had gone a long way.\nThen she communed with herself, and found that she was thinking:  If\nI might only swim all the water and be free.\n\nAnd still she swam on:  and now a light wind had been drawn up from\nthe west, and was driving a little ripple athwart the lake, and she\nswam the swiftlier for it awhile, but then turned over on her back\nand floated southward still.  Till on a sudden, as she lay looking up\ntoward the far-away blue sky, and she so little and low on the face\nof the waters, and the lake so deep beneath her, and the wind coming\never fresher from the west, and the ripple rising higher against her,\na terror fell upon her, and she longed for the green earth and its\nwell-wrought little blossoms and leaves and grass; then she turned\nover again and swam straight for the eyot, which now was but a little\ngreen heap far away before her.\n\nLong she was ere she made land there, and the sun was high in the\nheavens when she came, all spent and weary, to the shadow of the\nhawthorn-tree; and she cast herself down there and fell asleep\nstraightway.  Forsooth her swim was about as much as she had might\nfor.\n\nWhen she awoke it lacked but an hour of noon-tide, and she felt the\nlife in her and was happy, but had no will to rise up for a while;\nfor it was ajoy to her to turn her head this way and that to the dear\nand dainty flowers, that made the wide, grey, empty lake seem so far\naway, and no more to be dealt with than the very sky itself.\n\nAt last she arose, and when she had plucked and eaten some handfuls\nof the strawberries which grew plenteously on the sweet ground of the\neyot, she went down to the landward-looking shore, and took the\nwater, and swam slowly across the warm ripple till she came once more\nto the strand and her raiment.  She clad herself, and set her hand to\nher pouch and drew forth bread, and sat eating it on the bank above\nthe smooth sand.  Then she looked around, and stood up with her face\ntoward the house, to see if the dame would call to her.  But she saw\nthe witch come out of the porch and stand there looking under the\nsharp of her hand toward her, and thereafter she went back again into\nthe house without giving any sign.  Wherefore Birdalone deemed that\nshe had leave that day, and that she might take yet more holiday; so\nshe stepped lightly down from her place of vantage, turned her face\ntoward the east, and went quietly along the very lip of the water.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.  BIRDALONE COMES ON NEW TIDINGS\n\n\n\nSoon she had covered up the house from her, for on that eastern end,\nboth a tongue of the woodland shoved out west into the meadow, and,\nwithal, the whole body of the wood there drew down to the water, and\npresently cut off all the greensward save a narrow strip along by the\nlake, off the narrowest whereof lay the rocky eyot aforesaid, nigher\nunto the shore than lay Green Eyot.\n\nNow never had Birdalone gone so far east as to be over against Rock\nEyot.  In her childish days the witch had let her know that she might\ngo where she would, but therewith had told her a tale of a huge\nserpent which dwelt in the dark wood over against Rock Eyot, whose\nwont it was to lap his folds round and round living things that went\nthere, and devour them; and many an evil dream had that evil serpent\nbrought to Birdalone.  In after days belike she scarce trowed in the\ntale, yet the terror of it abode with her.  Moreover the wildwood\ntoward that side, as it drew toward the water, was dark and dreary\nand forbidding, running into black thickets standing amidst\nquagmires, all unlike to the sweet, clean upland ridges, oak begrown\nand greenswarded, of the parts which lay toward the north, and which\nshe mostly haunted.\n\nBut this summer day, which was so bright and hot, Birdalone deemed\nshe might harden her heart to try the adventure; and she had a mind\nto enter the wood thereby, and win her way up into the oakland\nwhereas she had met Habundia, and perchance she might happen on her;\nfor she would not dare to summon her so soon after their first\nmeeting.  And if she met her, there would be the holiday worthily\nbrought to an end!\n\nOn went Birdalone, and was soon at the narrowest of the greensward,\nand had the wood black on her left hand, for the trees of it were\nmostly alder.  But when she was come just over against Rock Eyot, she\nfound a straight creek or inlet of the water across her way; and the\nsaid creek ran right up into the alder thicket; and, indeed, was much\noverhung by huge ancient alders, gnarled, riven, mossy, and falling\nlow over the water.  But close on the mouth of the creek, on\nBirdalone's side thereof, lay a thing floating on the dull water,\nwhich she knew not how to call a boat, for such had she never seen,\nnor heard of, but which was indeed a boat, oarless and sailless.\n\nShe looked on it all about, and wondered; yet she saw at once that it\nwas for wending the water, and she thought, might she but have a long\npole, she might push it about the shallow parts of the lake, and\nbelike take much fish.  She tried to shove it somewhat toward the\nlake, but with her little might could make nothing of the work; for\nthe craft was heavy, like a barge, if there were nothing else that\nwithstood her.\n\nAbout this new thing she hung a long while, wondering that she had\nnever heard thereof, or been set to toil therewith.  She noted that\nit was mostly pale grey of hue, as if it had been bleached by sun and\nwater, but at the stem and stern were smears of darker colour, as\nthough someone had been trying the tints of staining there.\n\nNow so much did this new matter take up all her mind, that she\nthought no more of going up into the wood; but though she had fain\nabided there long to see whatever might be seen, she deemed it would\ngo ill with her did the witch happen on her there; wherefore she\nturned about, and went back the way she had come, going very slowly\nand pondering the tidings.  And ever she called to mind what Habundia\nhad said to her, that it was by water she must flee, and wondered if\nshe had sent her this thing that she might escape therein; so\ndifferent as her going would be thereby to swimming the lake with her\nwet body.  Then again she thought, that before she might let herself\nhope this, it were best, if she might, to find out from the witch\nwhat was the thing, and if she knew thereof.  Yet at last she called\nto mind how little patient of questions was her mistress, and that if\nshe were unheedful she might come to raise an evil storm about her.\nWherefore she took this rede at the last, that she would keep all\nhidden in her own breast till she should see Habundia again; and\nmeanwhile she might steal down thither from time to time to see if\nthe thing still abode there; which she might the easier do by\nswimming if she chose her time heedfully, and go thither from Rock\nEyot, which now and again she visited.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.  OF BIRDALONE'S GUILT AND THE CHASTISEMENT THEREOF\n\n\n\nBy this she was come back to the sandy bight, and the sun was\nwestering; and she looked up toward the house and saw that it was the\ntime of their evening meal, for the blue smoke of the cooking fire\nwas going up into the air.  So she went thither speedily, and entered\ngay of seeming.  The witch looked on her doubtfully, but presently\nfell to speaking with her graciously as yesterday, and Birdalone was\nglad and easy of mind, and went about the serving of her; for always\nshe ate after the dame; and the mistress asked her of many matters\nconcerning the house, and the gathering of stuff.\n\nSo came the talk on the fishing of the brook that ran before their\ndoor, and how the trouts therein were but little, and not seldom none\nat all; and even therewith came these words into Birdalone's mouth,\nshe scarce knew how:  My lady, why do we not fish the lake, whereas\nthere be shoal places betwixt us and the eyots where lie many and\ngreat fish, as I have seen when I have been swimming thereover?  And\nnow in that same creek whereas the serpent used to lurk when I was\nlittle, we have a thing come, which is made to swim on the water; and\nI, could I have a long pole to shove withal.\n\nBut no time she had to make an end, ere the witch-wife sprang up and\nturned on her with a snarl as of an evil dog, and her face changed\nhorribly:  her teeth showed grinning, her eyes goggled in her head,\nher brow was all to-furrowed, and her hands clenched like iron\nsprings.\n\nBirdalone shuddered back from her and cringed in mere terror, but had\nno might to cry out.  The witch hauled her up by the hair, and\ndragged her head back so that her throat lay bare before her all\nalong.  Then drew the witch a sharp knife from her girdle, and raised\nher hand over her, growling and snarling like a wolf.  But suddenly\nshe dropped the knife, her hand fell to her side, and she fell in a\nheap on the floor and lay there hushed.\n\nBirdalone stood gazing on her, and trembling in every limb; too\nconfused was she to think or do aught, though some image off light\nthrough the open door passed before her:  but her feet seemed of\nlead, and, as in an evil dream, she had no might to move her limbs,\nand the minutes went by as she stood there half dead with fear.\n\nAt last, (and belike it was no long while) the witch-wife came to\nherself again, and sat up on the floor, and looked all about the\nchamber, and when her eyes fell upon Birdalone, she said in a weak\nvoice, yet joyfully; Hah! thou art there still, my good servant!\nThen she said:  A sickness fell upon me suddenly, as whiles it is\nwont; but now am I myself again; and presently I have a word for\nthee.\n\nTherewith she rose up slowly, Birdalone helping her, and sat in her\nbig chair silent awhile, and then she spake:  My servant, thou hast\nfor the more part served me well:  but this time thou hast done ill,\nwhereas thou hast been spying on my ways; whereof may come heavy\ntrouble but if we look to it.  Well is it for thee that thou hast\nnone unto whom thou mightest babble; for then must I needs have slain\nthee here and now.  But for this first time I pardon thee, and thou\nhast escaped the wrath.\n\nHer voice was soft and wheedling; but for Birdalone the terror had\nentered into her soul, and yet abode with her.\n\nThe witch-wife sat a while, and then arose and went about the\nchamber, and came to a certain aumbry and opened it, and drew forth a\nlittle flasket of lead and a golden cup scored over with strange\nsigns, and laid them on the board beside her chair, wherein she now\nsat down again, and spake once more, still in the same soft and\nwheedling voice:  Yet, my servant, thy guilt would be required of me,\nif I let this pass as if to-day were the same as yesterday; yea, and\nof thee also would it be required; therefore it is a part of the\npardon that thou be corrected:  and the correction must be terrible\nto thee, that thou mayst remember never again to thrust thyself into\nthe jaws of death.  And what may I do to correct thee?  It shall be\nin a strange way, such as thou hast never dreamed of.  Yet the\nanguish thereof shall go to thine heart's root; but this must thou\nneeds bear, for my good and thine, so that both we may live and be\nmerry hereafter.  Go now, fill this cup with water from the spring\nand come back with it.  Birdalone took the cup with a sinking heart,\nand filled it, and brought it back, and stood before the witch more\ndead than alive.\n\nThen the witch-wife took up the flasket and pulled out the stopple\nand betook it to Birdalone, and said:  Drink of this now, a little\nsip, no more.  And the maiden did so, and the liquor was no sooner\ndown her gullet than the witch-wife and the chamber, and all things\nabout her, became somewhat dim to her; but yet not so much so as that\nshe could not see them.  But when she stretched out her arm she could\nsee it not at all, nor her limbs nor any other part of her which her\neyes might fall upon.  Then would she have uttered a lamentable wail,\nbut the voice was sealed up in her and no sound came from her voice.\nThen she heard the witch-wife how she said (and yet she heard it as\nif her voice came from afar), Nay, thou canst not speak, and thou\ncanst not see thyself, nor may any other, save me, and I but dimly.\nBut this is but part of what I must lay upon thee; for next I must\ngive thee a new shape, and that both thyself and all other may see.\nBut, before I do that, I must speak a word to thee, which thy new\nshape would not suffer the sense thereof to reach to thine heart.\nHearken!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.  THE WORDS OF THE WITCH-WIFE TO BIRDALONE\n\n\n\nSaid the witch-wife:  When thou comest to thyself (for it is not my\nwill that thou shouldest never have thine own shape again), doubtless\nthe first thing which thou shalt do with thy new-gained voice and thy\nnew-gained wit shall be to curse me, and curse me again.  Do as thou\nwilt herein; but I charge thee, disobey me not, for that shall bring\nthee to thy bane.  For if thou do not my bidding, and if thou pry\ninto my matters, and lay bare that which I will have hidden, then\nwill it be imputed unto thee for guilt, and will I, will I not, I\nmust be avenged on thee even to slaying:  and then is undone all the\ntoil and pain I have had in rearing thee into a deft and lovely\nmaiden.  Deem thou, then, this present anguish kind to thee, to keep\nthee that thou come not to nought.\n\nNow since I have begun speaking, I will go on; for little heretofore\nhave I spoken to thee what was in mine heart.  Well I wot that thou\nthinkest of me but as of an evil dream, whereof none can aught but\nlong to awake from it.  Yet I would have thee look to this at least;\nthat I took thee from poverty and pinching, and have reared thee as\nfaithfully as ever mother did to child; clemming thee never, smiting\nthee not so oft, and but seldom cruelly.  Moreover, I have suffered\nthee to go whereso thou wouldest, and have compelled thee to toil for\nnought but what was needful for our two livelihoods.  And I have not\nstayed thy swimmings in the lake, nor thy wanderings in the wood, and\nthou hast learned bowshot there, till thou art now a past-master in\nthe craft:  and, moreover, thou art swift-foot as the best of the\ndeer, and mayest over-run any one of them whom thou wilt.\n\nSoothly a merry life hast thou had as a child, and merry now would be\nthy life, save for thine hatred of me.  Into a lovely lily-lass hast\nthou grown.  That I tell thee now, though my wont has been to gird at\nthee for the fashion of thy body; that was but the word of the\nmistress to the thrall.  And now what awaiteth thee?  For thou mayst\nsay:  I am lonely here, and there is no man to look on me.  Of what\navail, therefore, is my goodliness and shapeliness?  Child, I answer\nthee that the time is coming when thou shalt see here a many of the\nfairest of men, and then shalt thou be rather rose than lily, and\nfully come to womanhood; and all those shall love and worship thee,\nand thou mayst gladden whom thou wilt, and whom thou wilt mayst\nsadden; and no lack soever shalt thou have of the sweetness of love,\nor the glory of dominion.\n\nThink of it then!  All this is for thee if thou dwell here quietly\nwith me, doing my will till thy womanhood hath blossomed.  Wherefore\nI beseech and pray thee put out of thy mind the thought of fleeing\nfrom me.  For if thou try it, one of two things shall be:  either I\nshall bring thee back and slay thee, or make thee live in misery of\ntorment; or else thou wilt escape, and then what will it be?  Dost\nthou know how it shall go with thee, coming poor and nameless, an\noutcast, into the world of men?  Lust shalt thou draw unto thee, but\nscarce love.  I say an outcast shalt thou be, without worship or\ndominion; thy body shall be a prey to ribalds, and when the fine\nflower thereof hath faded, thou shalt find that the words of thy\nlovers were but mockery.  That no man shall love thee, and no woman\naid thee.  Then shall Eld come to thee and find thee at home with\nHell; and Death shall come and mock thee for thy life cast away for\nnought, for nought.  This is my word to thee:  and now I have nought\nto do to thee save to change thee thy skin, and therein must thou do\nas thou canst, but it shall be no ugly or evil shape at least.  But\nanother time maybe I shall not be so kind as to give thee a new\nshape, but shall let thee wander about seen by none but me.  Then she\ntook the cup and took water in the hollow of her hand and cast it\ninto Birdalone's face, and muttered words withal; and presently she\nsaw herself indeed, that she was become a milk-white hind; and she\nheard and saw again, but not as she, the maiden, was wont to hear and\nsee; for both her hearing and seeing and her thought was of a beast\nand not of a maiden.\n\nSaid the witch-wife:  It is done now, till I give thee grace again;\nand now be off into the field; but if thou stray more than half a\nbowshot from the brook, it shall be the worse for thee.  And now the\nday was done and night was come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.  BIRDALONE MEETETH THE WOOD-WOMAN AGAIN\n\n\n\nIt was fifteen days thereafter that Birdalone awoke lying in her bed\non a bright morning, as if all this had been but a dream.  But the\nwitch-wife was standing over her and crying out:  Thou art late,\nslug-a-bed, this fair-weather day, and the grass all spoiling for\nlack of the scythe.  Off! and down to the meadow with thee.\n\nBirdalone waited not for more words, but sprang out of bed, and had\nher work-a-day raiment on in a twinkling, and stayed but to wash her\nin a pool of the brook, and then was amidst the tall grass with the\nswathe falling before her.  As she worked she thought, and could\nscarce tell whether joy at her present deliverance, or terror of the\nwitch-wife, were the greatest.  Sore was her longing to go see her\nfriend in the wood, but the haysel lasted more than a week, and when\nthat was done, whether it were of set purpose or no, the dame forgat\nher other promise, to give Birdalone more holiday, and kept her close\nto her work about meadow and acre.  Otherwise her mistress nowise\nmishandled or threatened her, though she had gone back to the\nsurliness and railing which was her wont.  At last, on a morning when\nthe dame had bidden her to nought of work, Birdalone took her bow in\nher hand and cast her quiver on her back, and went her ways into the\nwood, and forgat not the tress of Habundia's hair; but she had no\nneed to use it, for when she was come to the Oak of Tryst,\nstraightway came Habundia forth from the thicket, and now so like to\nBirdalone that it was a wonder, for as her friend she bare bow and\nquiver, and green gown trussed up till her knees were naked.\n\nSo they kissed and embraced, and Birdalone wept upon her friend's\nbosom, but was ashamed of the words which would have told her of her\ncase.  Then Habundia set her down upon the greensward, and sat down\nbeside her, and caressed her and soothed her; then she smiled on\nBirdalone, and said:  Thy tale is partly told without words, and I\nwould weep for thee if I might shed tears.  But thou mayest tell me\nwherefore thou didst suffer this; though forsooth I have an inkling\nthereof.  Hast thou happened on the witch's ferry?\n\nEven so it was, sister, quoth Birdalone.  And therewith she plucked\nup heart, and told her all the tale of the vanishing of her body and\nthe skin-changing.  And Habundia answered:  Well then, there is this\nto be said, that sooner or later this must have happened, for thereby\nlieth thy road of escape; wherefore it is better sooner than later.\nBut tell me again:  was she fierce and rough in words with thee? for\nwhat she said to thee thou hast not yet told me.  Said Birdalone:  In\nher first fury, when she was like to have slain me, she had no words,\nnought but wolfish cries.  But thereafter she spake unto me\nstrangely, yet neither fiercely nor roughly; nay, it seemed to me as\nif almost she loved me.  And more than almost she besought me rather\nthan commanded me not to flee from her.  And wert thou beguiled by\nher soft speech? said Habundia.  Nowise to cast aside my hope of\nescape, nay, not even in that hour, said Birdalone; but amidst all\nthe confusion and terror somewhat was I moved to compassion on her.\n\nSpake Habundia, looking anxiously on her:  Dost thou deem that thou\nart somewhat cowed by what she hath done to thee?  Said Birdalone,\nand flushed very red:  Oh no, no!  Nought save death or bonds shall\ncome betwixt me and my utmost striving for escape.  That is better\nthan well, said Habundia; but again, canst thou have patience a\nlittle, and be wary and wise the while?  So meseemeth, said the\nmaiden.  Said Habundia:  Again it is well.  Now is the summer\nbeginning to wane, and by my rede thou shalt not try the flight until\nMay is come again and well-nigh worn into June; for thou wilt be\nbigger then, little sister, and tidings are waxing that shall get\nmatters ready for thy departure:  moreover, thou must yet learn what\nthou hast to do meanwhile, and thereof shall I tell thee somewhat as\nnow.  For that boat, the thing which thou didst find, and for which\nthou didst suffer, is called the Sending Boat, and therein thy\nmistress fareth time and again, I deem to seek to some other of her\nkind, but I know not unto whom, or whereto.  Hast thou noted of her\nthat whiles she goeth away privily by night and cloud?  Yea, verily,\nsaid Birdalone, and this is one of the things which heretofore hath\nmade me most afraid.  Said Habundia:  Well now, that she wendeth\nsomewhither in this ferry I wot; but as I wot not whither, so also I\nknow not what she doth with the Sending Boat to make it obey her;\nwhereas, though I know all things of the wood, I know but little of\nthe lake.  Wherefore, though there be peril to thee therein, follow\nher twice or thrice when she riseth up for this faring, and note\nclosely what is her manner of dealing with the said Sending Boat, so\nthat thou mayst do in like wise.  Wilt thou risk the smart and the\nskin-changing, or even if it were the stroke of the knife, to gather\nthis wisdom?  And thereafter thou shalt come hither and tell me how\nthou hast sped.  With a good heart will I, dear sister, said\nBirdalone.\n\nThen Habundia kissed her and said:  It is a joy to me to see thee so\nvaliant, but herein may I help thee somewhat; here is a gold finger-\nring, see thou! fashioned as a serpent holding his tail in his mouth;\nwhenso thou goest on this quest, set thou this same ring on the\nmiddle finger of thy left hand, and say thou above thy breath at\nleast:\n\n\nTo left and right,\nBefore, behind,\nOf me be sight\nAs of the wind!\n\n\nAnd nought then shall be seen of thee even by one who standeth close\nbeside.  But wear not the ring openly save at such times, or let the\nwitch have sight thereof ever, or she will know that thou hast met\nme.  Dost thou understand, and canst thou remember?\n\nLaughed Birdalone, and took the ring and set it on her finger, and\nspake aloud even as Habundia had given her the words.  Then quoth\nHabundia, laughing:  Now have I lost my friend and sister, for thou\nart gone, Birdalone.  Take off the ring, sweetling, and get thee to\nthine hunting, for if thou come home empty-handed there will be\nflyting awaiting thee, or worse.\n\nSo Birdalone took off the ring and came back to sight again laughing;\nthen the wood-woman kissed her and turned her heels to her, and was\ngone; but Birdalone strung her bow, and got to her woodcraft, and\npresently had a brace of hares, wherewith she went back home to the\ndame; who indeed girded at her for her sloth, and her little catch in\nso long a while; but there it ended.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.  OF BIRDALONE'S FISHING\n\n\n\nNow were the days wearing toward wheat-harvest, and nought befel to\ntell of, save that on a morn the witch-wife called Birdalone to her,\nand said:  Now is little to be done till the wheat is ready for the\nhook, and thy days are idle; or what is that word that fell from thee\nthat other day, that there be good swims for fish about the eyots?\nCanst thou swim across bearing thine angle, and back again therewith,\nand thy catch withal?  Yea, certes, said Birdalone gaily; with one\nhand I may swim gallantly, or with my legs alone, if I stir mine arms\never so little.  I will go straightway if thou wilt, lady; but give\nme a length of twine so that I may tie my catch about my middle when\nI swim back again.\n\nTherewith she went forth lightly to fetch her angle, which was in a\nshed without; but just as she took it in her hand, a sudden thought\ncame to her, so wary as she was grown.  She undid the bosom of her\ngown, and took forth her serpent-ring; for she bore it next to her\nskin, made fast to the bosom of her smock; but now she hid it\ncarefully in the thickest of her brow-hair, which was very thick and\nsoft.  Withal the tress of Habundia's hair she bore ever mingled with\nher own.\n\nNo sooner had she done it, but she was glad; for she heard the dame\ncalling her, who, when she came to the house-door, spake and said:\nNow shall I fare with thee down to the water, and look to thy\ngarments lest they be fouled by some straying beast.  And therewith\nshe looked curiously on Birdalone, and knit her brows when she saw\nthat the maiden changed countenance in nowise.\n\nDown to the water went they, and the witch sat down close to where\nBirdalone should take the water, and watched her do off her raiment,\nand eyed her keenly when she was bare, but said nought.  Birdalone\nturned her head as she stood knee-deep, and said:  How long shall I\nabide, lady, if I have luck?  As long as thou wilt, said the dame:\nmost like I shall be gone by then thou comest back, even if thou be\naway no long while.\n\nFell Birdalone to swimming then, and when she was more than half\nover, the witch, stirring no more than need was, got hold of her\nraiment, which was but the old grey coat over a smock, and ransacked\nit, but found nought, as well ye may wot.  And when she had done, she\nsat down again in heavy mood as it seemed, and watched Birdalone\nswimming, and when she beheld her body come forth out of the water,\nand pass out of sight amongst the flowers of the eyot, she arose and\nwent her ways home.\n\nBirdalone looked through the willow-boughs, and saw her turn away;\nthen she fared to her fishing with a smile, and soon had plenteous\ncatch from under the willow-boughs.  Then, whereas the day was very\ncalm and fair, and the dame had given her holiday, she wandered about\nthe eyot, and most in a little wood of berry-trees, as quicken and\nwhitebeam and dog-wood, and sported with the birds, who feared her\nnot, but came and sat on her shoulders, and crept about her feet.\nShe went also and stood a while on the southern shore, and looked on\nthe wide water dim in the offing under the hot-weather haze, and\nlonged to be gone beyond it.  Then she turned away, and to the other\nshore, and gat her fish and strung them on the string, and made them\nfast to her middle, and so took the water back again to the yellow\nstrand, where now was no one awaiting her.  But before she did on her\ngarments, she looked on them, and saw that they lay not as she had\nleft them, whereby she knew well that the witch-wife had handled\nthem.\n\nAmidst all this the day was wearing to an end, and again she saw the\nsmoke of the cooking-fire going up into the air from the chimney of\nthe house; and she smiled ruefully, thinking that the witch might yet\nfind an occasion for ransacking her raiment.  But she plucked up\nheart, and came home with her catch, and the dame met her with a glum\nface, and neither praised her nor blamed her, but took the fish\nsilently.  Such ending had that day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.  BIRDALONE WEARETH HER SERPENT-RING\n\n\n\nAfter this she went once and again fishing on to Green Eyot by the\nbidding of the dame, who went not again to the shore with her.  These\ntimes she had half a mind to go see the Sending Boat, but durst not,\nlest the thing itself might have life enough to tell of her.\n\nAnd now was come the time of wheat-harvest, and Birdalone must wear\nher days swinking in the acre-land, clad but in smock and shoes; and\nthe toil was hard, and browned her skin and hardened her hands, but\nit irked her not, for the witch let her work all alone, and it was\nholiday unto the maiden if her mistress were not anigh, despite those\nwords which had somewhat touched her heart that other day.\n\nBut when wheat-getting was done, there was again rest for her body,\nand swimming withal and fishing from the eyot by the witch's leave.\nAnd again by her own leave she went to seek Habundia in the wood, and\nspent a happy hour with her, and came back with a fawn which she had\nshot, and so but barely saved her skin from the twig-shower.  Then\nyet again she went into the wood on the witch's errand as well as her\nown, and was paid by her friend's sweet converse, and by nought else\nsave the grudging girding of her mistress.\n\nBut on a night when September was well in, and the sky was moonless\nand overcast, somewhat before midnight the dame came and hung over\nBirdalone as she lay abed, and watched to see if she waked; forsooth\nthe witch's coming had waked her; but even so she was wary, and lay\nstill, nor changed her breathing.  So the witch turned away, but even\ntherewith Birdalone made a shift to get a glimpse of her, and this\nshe saw thereby, that the semblance of her was changed, and that she\nbore the self-same skin wherewith she had come to Utterhay, and which\nshe had worn twice or thrice afterwards when she had an errand\nthither.\n\nThe witch now glided swiftly to the door, and out into the night.\nBirdalone lay still a little, lest she should fall into a trap, and\nthen arose very quietly and did on her smock, which lay ever under\nher pillow with the ring sewn thereto again, and so went out adoors\nalso, and deemed she saw the witch some way on ahead; but it was\nnothing for her light feet to overtake her.  So she stayed to take\nthe ring from her smock, and set it on her finger; then in a low\nvoice she said:\n\n\nTo left and right,\nBefore, behind,\nOf me be sight\nAs of the wind!\n\n\nThen boldly she sped on, and was soon close on the heels of the\nwitch, who made her way to the edge of the lake, and then turned\neast, and went even as Birdalone had gone when she came across the\nSending Boat.\n\nSo fared the witch-wife straight to the creek-side, and Birdalone\nmust needs stick close to her, or she had known nought, so black was\nthe night amongst the alder-boughs.  But the witch-wife fumbled about\na while when she was stayed by the creek, and presently drew somewhat\nfrom under her cloak, and the maiden saw that she was about striking\nflint upon steel, and quaked somewhat, lest her charm had played her\nfalse.  Presently the tinder quickened, and the dame had lighted a\nlantern, which she held up, peering all about; and full she looked on\nthe place whereas was Birdalone, and made no show of seeing her,\nthough well-nigh the maiden looked for it to see her drop the lantern\nand spring on her.\n\nNow the witch, holding the lantern aloft, steps over the gunwale of\nthe boat, and sits down on the thwart; and it was a near thing but\nthat Birdalone followed her into the boat, but she feared the getting\nforth again, so she but hung over it as close as she might.  Then she\nsaw the witch draw out of her girdle that sharp little knife which\nBirdalone had seen raised against her own throat; and then the witch\nbared her arm, and pricked it till the blood sprang from that barren\nwhite skin; thereat she stood up, and went to the bows of the craft\nand hung over them, and drew her arm to and fro over the stem to\nbloody it; and went thereafter to the stern, and took blood into her\nright hand and passed it over the place of the steerage (for there\nwas no rudder) and came back and sat down on the thwart again; and,\nso far as Birdalone might see, busied herself in staunching the\nlittle wound on her arm.  Then deemed Birdalone that she knew what\nmanner of paint was that which had made the rusty smears which she\nhad seen on the boat by daylight.\n\nBut now as the witch sat there, a harsh voice began to stir in her\nthroat, and then words came out of her, and she sang in a crow's\ncroak:\n\n\nThe red raven-wine now\nHast thou drunk, stern and bow;\nThen wake and awake\nAnd the wonted way take!\nThe way of the Wender forth over the flood,\nFor the will of the Sender is blent with the blood.\n\n\nTherewithal began the boat to stir, and anon it glided forth out of\nthe creek into the waters of the lake, and the light of the lantern\ndied, and it was but a minute ere Birdalone lost all sight of it.\nShe abode a little longer, lest perchance boat and witch might come\nback on her hands, and then turned and went swiftly back again.  She\nwould have drawn off her ring straightway, but the thought came on\nher, that she had seen the witch depart in her second semblance; how\nif she were abiding her at home in her wonted skin?  So she came to\nthe house even as she was, and opened the door, and looked in,\nquaking; but there was no image of a child of Adam therein, and no\nliving thing, save the cat drowsing before the fire; wherefore\nBirdalone took the ring from her finger and went to the hearth, and\nstirred up the cat with her foot till he arose and fell to rubbing\nhimself against her legs, and she was fain of him.\n\nThereafter she made her ring fast to her smock again, and set the\nsmock under her pillow as her wont was, and betook herself to bed,\nand fell asleep sweetly, leaving all troublous thoughts for the\nmorrow; and that the more as she was free of the witch-wife for that\nnight at least.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.  BIRDALONE MEETETH HABUNDIA AGAIN; AND LEARNETH HER\nFIRST WISDOM OF HER\n\n\n\nWhen morning was, Birdalone arose, and longed sore to go into the\nwood to seek Habundia again, but durst not, lest the witch-wife\nshould come to hand again earlier than might be looked for.  So she\nabode quiet and did what was toward near about the house.  All that\nday the witch came not back, nor the next; but the morrow thereafter,\nwhen Birdalone arose, she found the wonted aspect of her mistress in\nthe wonted place, who, when she saw the maiden, greeted her, and was\nsomewhat blithe with her; and Birdalone would have asked her leave to\ngo to the wood, but she trusted little in her unwonted soft mood;\nwhich yet lasted so long that on the third day she herself bade\nBirdalone go take her pleasure in the wood, and bear back with her\nwhat of venison she might.\n\nForthwith went Birdalone as glad as might be, and met her friend at\nthe Oak of Tryst, and told her closely how all had betid; and\nHabundia said:  Here, then, thou hast learned how to sail the lake.\nBut hast thou learned enough to try the adventure and not to fail?\nEven so I deem, said Birdalone; but this I would say, that meseemeth\nit better that I follow the witch down to the boat one more time at\nleast; for this first time it was dark; and moreover shall I not be\nsurer of the spell if I hear it said oftener, lest it be not ever the\nsame words?  What sayest thou?  She said:  Thou art right herein,\nand, since the adventure may not be tried till next June is at hand,\nthere is time enough and to spare.  And now for this hour that is we\nneed talk no more of it.  Only, my sweet, I beseech thee be wary; and\nabove all suffer not the witch-wife to set eye or hand on the ring.\nTruly mine heart oft aches sorely for thy peril; for therein the\nimage of thee abideth rather as of my daughter than my friend.  Yea,\nnow thou laughest, but kindly, so that the sound of thy laughter is\nas sweet music.  But know that though thou art but a young maiden,\nand I in all wise like unto thee of aspect, yet have I dwelt many and\nmany a year upon the earth, and much wisdom have learned.  Trowest\nthou me?\n\nYea, yea, said Birdalone, with all my heart.  Then she hung her head\na while and kept silence, and thereafter looked up and spake:  I\nwould ask thee a thing and crave somewhat of thee, as if thou wert\nverily my mother; wilt thou grant it me?  Yea, surely, child, said\nHabundia.  Said Birdalone:  This it is then, that thou wilt learn me\nof thy wisdom.  Habundia smiled full kindly on her, and said:  This\nof all things I would have had thee ask; and this day and now shall\nwe begin to open the book of the earth before thee.  For therein is\nmine heritage and my dominion.  Sit by me, child, and hearken!\n\nSo the maiden sat down by her likeness under the oak, and began to\nlearn her lesson.  Forsooth forgotten is the wisdom, though the tale\nof its learning abideth, wherefore nought may we tell thereof.\n\nWhen it was done, Birdalone kissed her wood-mother and said:  This is\nnow the best day of my life, this and the day when first I saw thee.\nI will come hither now many times before the day of my departure.\nYea, but, sweet child, said Habundia, beware of the witch and her\ncruelty; I fear me she shall yet be grim toward thee.  So will I be\nwary, said Birdalone, but I will venture some little peril of pain\nbut if thou forbid me, mother.  And I pray thee by thy love to forbid\nme not.  And this I pray thee the more, because after one of these\ngrim times then mostly doth she meddle the less with me for a while,\nwherefore I shall be the freer to come hither.  Habundia kissed her\nand embraced her, and said:  Valiant art thou for a young maiden, my\nchild, and I would not refrain thee more than a father would refrain\nhis young son from the strokes of the tilt-yard.  But I pray thee to\nforget not my love, and my sorrow for thy grief.\n\nTherewith they sundered, and it was drawing toward evening.\nBirdalone sought catch, and brought home venison to the dame, who was\nyet blithe with her, and spake that evening as she eyed her:  I\ncannot tell how it is, but thou seemest changed unto me, and lookest\nmore towards thy womanhood than even yesterday.  I mean the face of\nthee, for wert thou stripped, lean enough I should see thee,\ndoubtless.  But now look to it, I beseech thee, to be both deft and\nobedient, so that I may be as kind to thee as I would be, and kinder\nthan I have been heretofore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.  THE PASSING OF THE YEAR INTO WINTER\n\n\n\nWore the days now, till on a night of October, toward the end\nthereof, the witch went a-night-tide to the Sending Boat, and\nBirdalone followed her as erst.  This time the night was wild and\nwindy, but the moon was high aloft and big, and all cloud save a few\nflecks was blown from off the heavens; so that the night was as light\nas could be; and even at the tree-hung creek it was easy to see all\nthat was done.  And so it was that the witch did and spake in all\nwise as she did before.\n\nAnother time, when November was well-nigh out, the dame arose for her\nlake-faring; but this night the snow lay deep betwixt house and\nwater, and Birdalone thought that it would scarce do to follow.\nForsooth she knew not whether her feet would the less leave their\nprint in the snow because they were not to be seen.  When she asked\nHabundia thereof, she laughed and said:  Once more thou hast been\nwise, my child, for though it had been no harder to put this might\ninto thy ring, that whoso wore it should not touch the ground, yet it\nhath not been done.\n\nIt must be told, that in this while Birdalone went oft to the\nTrysting Tree, and called on her mother (as now she called her) to\ncome to her, and ever more and more of wisdom she won thereby.\nThough the witch was oft surly with her, and spared not her girding,\nyet, the needful work done, she meddled little with her.  But on a\nday she straightly banned her the wood, and Birdalone went\nnotwithstanding, and when she was there with the wood-mother nought\nshe told her thereof, but was blithe and merry beyond her wont.  She\ncame back home thereafter empty handed, and stepped into the chamber\nproudly and with bright eyes and flushed cheeks, though she looked\nfor nought save chastisement; yea, it might be even the skin-\nchanging.  Forsooth the witch was sitting crouched in her chair with\nher hands on the elbows and her head thrust forward, like a wild\nbeast at point to spring; but when her eye fell on Birdalone, she\nfaltered and drew back into herself again, and muttered somewhat\nunheard; but to Birdalone spake nought of good or bad.\n\nNow was winter-tide upon them, when there was nought to do in field\nand acre, and but a little in the byre.  In years bygone, and even in\nthe last one, the witch had not spared Birdalone toil any the more,\nbut had made errands for her amidst the snow and biting winds, or\nover the lake when it was laid with ice.  But now she bade her to\nnought save what she had a will to; whereby she lost but little,\nwhereas Birdalone was well willing to strive against wind and weather\nand the roughness of the winter earth, and overcome if she might, so\nthat all were well done that had to be done about the stead.\n\nStill did the witch give her hard words and rail at her for the most\npart, but from the teeth outward only, and because she was wont\nthereto.  Inwardly indeed she began to fear Birdalone, and deemed\nthat she would one day have the mastery; and this led her into fierce\nand restless moods; so that she would sit staring at the maiden's\nbeauty handling her knife withal, and scarce able to forbear her.\nAnd in such a mood she once made occasion to chastise her as her wont\nhad been erst, and looked to see Birdalone rebel against her; but it\nfell out otherwise, for Birdalone submitted herself to her meekly and\nwith a cheerful countenance.  And this also was a terror to the\nwitch, who deemed, as indeed it was, that the purpose was growing in\nher thrall.  So from that time she meddled with her no more.  All\nthis while, as may be thought, Birdalone went yet oftener to the Oak\nof Tryst, despite frost and snow and wind, and gat much lore of her\nwood-mother, and learned wisdom abundantly.  And her days were happy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.  OF SPRING-TIDE AND THE MIND OF BIRDALONE\n\n\n\nNow was the winter gone and the spring-tide come again, and with the\nblossoming of the earth blossomed Birdalone also.  Nought sweeter of\nflesh might she be than erst, but there was now a new majesty grown\ninto her beauty; her limbs were rounded, her body fulfilled, her skin\nsleeked and whitened; and if any mother's son had beheld her feet as\nthey trod the meadow besprinkled with saffron and daffodil, ill had\nit gone with him were he gainsaid the kisses of them, though for the\nkissing had he fared the worse belike.\n\nThat spring-tide, amidst of April, she followed the witch-wife down\nto the Sending Boat for the third time; and there went everything as\nerst, and she deemed now that the lesson was well learned, and that\nshe was well-nigh as wise as the witch herself therein.\n\nBut the day after she went about somewhat pensive, as though a\ntroublous thought were on her; and when, three days thereafter, she\nmet the wood-mother, she spake to her even as they parted, and said:\nMother, much wisdom hast thou learned me, and now this at the last\nwithal, that hitherto there has been shame in my life; and now fain\nwere I to be done with it.  Fair child, said Habundia, little is the\nshame though this woman hath had the upper hand of thee and hath used\nthee cruelly:  how mightest thou, a child, strive with her?  But now\nI see and know that there is an end of that; that she feareth thee\nnow, and will never again raise a hand against thee save thou fall\nwholly into her power; as thou shalt not, my child.  Be comforted\nthen for what is gone by!  Nay, mother, said Birdalone, it is not\nthat which troubleth me; for, as thou sayest, what else might I do?\nBut thy wisdom which thou hast set in my heart hath learned me that\nfor these last months I have been meeting guile with guile and lies\nwith lies.  And now will I do so no more, lest I become a guileful\nwoman, with nought good in me save the fairness of my body.\nWherefore hearken, sweet mother!  What is done, is done; but when it\ncometh to the day, which is speedily drawing nigh, that I must part\nfrom thee, it may be for a long while, then will I not fare to the\nSending Boat by night and cloud and with hidden head, but will walk\nthither in broad day, and let that befall which must befall.\n\nChanged then Habundia's face and became haggard and woeful, and she\ncried out:  O if I could but weep, as ye children of Adam!  O my\ngrief and sorrow!  Child, child! then will betide that falling into\nher hands which I spake of e'en now; and then shall this wretch, this\nservant of evil, assuredly slay thee there and then, or will keep\nthee to torment thee till thy life be but a slow death.  Nay, nay, do\nas I should do, and fare with hidden head, and my ring on thy finger.\nOr else, O child, how wilt thou hurt me!\n\nBirdalone wept; but presently she fell to caressing the mother's\nhand, and said:  This is thy doing, wherein thou hast made me wise.\nYet fear not:  for I deem that the witch-wife will not slay me,\nwhereas she looketh to have some gain of me; moreover, in the evil of\nher heart is mingled some love toward me, whereof, as erst I told\nthee, I have a morsel of compassion.  Mother, she will not slay me;\nand I say that she shall not torment me, for I will compel her to\nslay me else.  It is my mind that she will let me go.  Said the\nmother:  Yea, mayhappen, yet but as a bird with a string to its leg.\nIf it be so, said Birdalone, then let my luck prevail over her guile;\nas well it may be, since I have known thee, O wise mother!\n\nThe wood-wife hung her head and spake nought for a while; then she\nsaid:  I see that thou wilt have it so, and that there is something\nin thine heart which we, who are not children of Adam, may not\nunderstand; yet once wert thou more like unto us.  Now all I may say\nis, that thou must rule in this matter, and that I am sad.\n\nThen she looked down again and presently raised a brighter face, and\nsaid:  Belike all shall be better than I thought.  Then she kissed\nBirdalone and they parted for that time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.  THEY BID FAREWELL, BIRDALONE AND THE WOOD-MOTHER\n\n\n\nNow April was gone, and May was come with the thorn a-blossoming, and\nthere was Birdalone waxing still in loveliness.  And now the witch\nhad left all girding at her even, and spake to her but little, save\nwhen she needs must.  But to Birdalone it seemed that she watched her\nexceeding closely.\n\nBirdalone went oft to the wood, and learned yet more of lore:  but of\nthe matter of the Departure, how it was to be gone about they spake\nno more, and great was the love betwixt them.\n\nAt last when May was worn nigh to June came Birdalone to the Oak of\nTryst, and found the wood-mother there; and when they had talked a\nwhile, but ever from the teeth out, spake Habundia:  Though thou be\nnow the wiser of us two maybe, yet have I wisdom to wot that this is\nthe hour of our sundering, and that to-morrow thou wilt try the\nadventure of the Sending Boat:  is it not so?  Yea, mother, said\nBirdalone; I bid thee farewell now:  woe is me therefor!  Said\nHabundia:  And thou wilt deliver thyself into the hands of the witch,\nwilt thou, as thou saidst that other day?  Quoth Birdalone:  Is it\nnot wisdom, dear mother, if I trust in my goodhap?  Alas, said the\nmother, it may be so when all is said.  But O my sad heart! and how I\nfear for thee!\n\nMy mother, my mother! said Birdalone, that I should make the days\ngrievous unto thee! and thou who hast made my days so joyous!  But\nnow canst thou not say of thy wisdom that we shall meet again?\n\nThe wood-woman sat down, and let her head fall over her knees, and\nwas silent a long while; then she rose up and stood before Birdalone,\nand said:  Yea, we shall meet again, howsoever it may be.  Let us\ndepart with that sweet word in the air between us.  Yet first thou\nshalt give me a tress of thine hair, as I did to thee when first we\nmet; for by means of it may I know to-morrow how thou hast sped.\n\nEven so did Birdalone, and this was the end of their talk, save\nbroken words of lamentation as they said farewell.  And therewith for\nthat while they sundered.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.  OF BIRDALONE AND THE SENDING BOAT\n\n\n\nBirdalone woke up in the morning, and arose and clad herself, and she\nsaw not the witch-wife in the chamber, though her bed looked as if it\nhad been slept in.  Birdalone accounted little thereof, whereas the\ndame would oft go on one errand or another much betimes in the\nmorning.  Yet was she somewhat glad, for she was nowise wishful for a\nwrangle with her.  Withal, despite her valiancy, as may well be\nthought, she was all a-flutter with hopes and fears, and must needs\nrefrain her body from overmuch quaking and restlessness if she might.\n\nNow she mingled the tress of the wood-mother's hair with her own\nhair, but deemed it nought perilous to leave the ring yet sewn to her\nsmock:  she set some deal of bread and flesh in her scrip, lest her\nvoyage should be long, and then all simply stepped over the threshold\nof the House of her Captivity.\n\nShe went straight to the strand aforesaid, seeing nought of the\nwitch-wife by the way; and when she came there, was about to turn\nstraightway to her left hand down to the creek, when it came into her\nmind that she would first swim over to Green Eyot for this last of\ntimes.  For the eyot indeed she loved, and deemed it her own, since\nnever had her evil dream, the witch, set foot thereon.  Moreover, she\nsaid to herself that the cool lake would allay the fever of her\nblood, and make her flesh firmer and less timorous for the adventure.\nAnd again, that if the witch should see her from afar, as she could\nscarce fail to do, she would deem the maiden was about her wonted\nmorning swimming, and would be the less like to spy on her.\n\nSo now, when she had let her garments slip from off her on to the\nsand close to the water's edge, she stood a while, with her feet\nscarce covered by the little ripple of the bight, to be a token of\nsafety to her mistress.  To say sooth, now it was come so nigh to the\ndeed, she shrank aback a little, and was fain to dally with the time,\nand, if it might be, thrust something of no import betwixt her and\nthe terror of the last moment.\n\nNow she took the water, and rowed strongly with her lovely limbs till\nshe came to the eyot, and there she went aland, and visited every\nplace which had been kind to her; and kissed the trees and flowers\nthat had solaced her, and once more drew the birds and rabbits to\nsport with her; till suddenly it came into her head that the time was\nwearing overfast.  Then she ran down to the water and plunged in, and\nswam over to the strand as fast as she might, and came aland there,\nthinking of nothing less than what had befallen.\n\nFor lo! when she looked around for her raiment and her scrip, it was\nnowhere to be seen; straightway then it came into her mind, as in one\nflash, that this was the witch's work; that she had divined this deed\nof the flight, and had watched her, and taken the occasion of her\nnakedness and absence that she might draw her back to the House of\nCaptivity.  And this the more as the precious ring was sewn to\nBirdalone's smock, and the witch would have found it there when she\nhandled the raiment.\n\nBirdalone wasted no time in seeking for the lost; she looked down on\nto the smooth sand, and saw there footprints which were not her own,\nand all those went straight back home to the house.  Then she turned,\nand for one moment of time looked up toward the house, and saw\nplainly the witch come out adoors, and the sun flashed from something\nbright in her hand.\n\nThen indeed she made no stay, but set off running at her swiftest\nalong the water-side toward the creek and the Sending Boat.  As is\naforesaid she was as fleet-foot as a deer, so but in a little space\nof time she had come to the creek, and leapt into the boat, panting\nand breathless.  She turned and looked hastily along the path her\nfeet had just worn, and deemed she saw a fluttering and flashing\ncoming along it, but some way off; yet was not sure, for her eyes\nwere dizzy with the swiftness of her flight and the hot sun and the\nhurry of her heart.  Then she looked about a moment confusedly, for\nshe called to mind that in her nakedness she had neither knife, nor\nscissors, nor bodkin to let her blood withal.  But even therewith\nclose to hand she saw hanging down a stem of half-dead briar-rose\nwith big thorns upon it; she hastily tore off a length thereof and\nscratched her left arm till the blood flowed, and stepped lightly\nfirst to stem and then to stern, and besmeared them therewith.  Then\nshe sat down on the thwart and cried aloud:\n\n\nThe red raven-wine now\nHast thou drunk, stern and bow;\nThen wake and awake\nAnd the wonted way take!\nThe way of the Wender forth over the flood,\nFor the will of the Sender is blent with the blood.\n\n\nScarce had she time to wonder if the boat would obey her spell ere it\nbegan to stir beneath her, and then glided out into the lake and took\nits way over the summer ripple, going betwixt Green Eyot and the\nmainland, as if to weather the western ness of the eyot:  and it went\nnot a stonecast from the shore of the said mainland.\n\nHither to meet it now cometh the witch, running along the bank, her\nskirts flying wild about her, and a heavy short-sword gleaming in her\nhand.  Her furious running she stayed over against the boat, and\ncried out in a voice broken for lack of breath:\n\n\nBack over the flood\nTo the house by the wood!\nBack unto thy rest\nIn the alder nest!\nFor the blood of the Sender lies warm on thy bow,\nAnd the heart of the Wender is weary as now.\n\n\nBut she saw that the Sending Boat heeded her words nothing, whereas\nit was not her blood that had awakened it, but Birdalone's.  Then\ncried out the witch:  O child, child! say the spell and come back to\nme! to me, who have reared thee and loved thee and hoped in thee!  O\ncome back!\n\nBut how should Birdalone heed her prayer?  She saw the sax; and\nwithal had her heart forgotten, her flesh might well remember.  She\nsat still, nor so much as turned her head toward the witch-wife.\n\nThen came wild yelling words from the witch's mouth, and she cried:\nGo then, naked and outcast!  Go then, naked fool! and come back\nhither after thou hast been under the hands of the pitiless!  Ah, it\nhad been better for thee had I slain thee!  And therewith she whirled\nthe sax over her head and cast it at Birdalone.  But now had the boat\nturned its head toward the ness of Green Eyot and was swiftly\ndeparting, so that Birdalone but half heard the last words of the\nwitch-wife, and the sax fell flashing into the water far astern.\n\nThere the witch stood tossing her arms and screaming, wordless; but\nno more of her saw Birdalone, for the boat came round about the ness\nof Green Eyot, and there lay the Great Water under the summer heavens\nall wide and landless before her.  And it was now noon of day.\n\n\nHere ends the First Part of the Water of the Wondrous Isles, which is\ncalled Of the House of Captivity.  And now begins the Second Part,\nwhich is called Of the Wondrous Isles.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND PART:  OF THE WONDROUS ISLES\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.  THE FIRST ISLE\n\n\n\nSo glided Birdalone over the lake and was come forth from the House\nof Captivity; it might well be that she was but swimming unto death;\nnaked as she was, fireless, foodless, and helpless, at the mercy of\nmere sorcery.  Yet she called to mind the word of the wood-mother\nthat they should meet again, and took heart thereby; and she was glad\nin that she had had her will, and shaken off the guile and thraldom\nof the witch.  Much she thought of the wood-mother, and loved her,\nand wondered had she yet sought into and seen her welfare by the\nburning of a hair of that tress of hers; and therewith she looked on\nthat tress of Habundia's hair and kissed it.\n\nAll day the Sending Boat sped on, and she saw no land and nought to\ntell of.  It was but wave and sky and the familiar fowl of the lake,\nas coot, and mallard, and heron, and now and then a swift wood-dove\ngoing her ways from shore to shore; two gerfalcons she saw also, an\nosprey, and a great ern on his errand high up aloft.\n\nBirdalone waked in her loneliness till the day was spent, and\nsomewhat worn of the night; then she fell asleep for weariness; but\nso it was, that before dusk she had deemed that a blue cloud lay\nbefore her in the offing which moved not.\n\nShe slept the short night through, and was awakened by the boat\nsmiting against something, and when her eyes opened she saw that she\nwas come aland and that the sun was just risen.  She stood up, and\nfor the first minute wondered where she was, and she beheld her\nnakedness and knew not what it meant; then she loosened her hair, and\nshook its abundance all about her, and thereafter she turned her eyes\non this new land and saw that it was fair and goodly.  The flowery\ngrass came down to the very water, and first was a fair meadow-land\nbesprinkled with big ancient trees; thence arose slopes of vineyard,\nand orchard and garden; and, looking down on all, was a great White\nHouse, carven and glorious.  A little air of wind had awakened with\nthe sunrise, and bore the garden sweetness down to her; and warm it\nwas after the chill of the wide water.  No other land could she see\nwhen she looked lakeward thence.\n\nShe stepped ashore, and stood ankle-deep in the sweet grass, and\nlooked about her for a while, and saw no shape of man astir.  She was\nyet weary, and stiff with abiding so long amongst the hard ribs of\nthe boat, so she laid herself down on the grass, and its softness\nsolaced her; and presently she fell asleep again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  BIRDALONE FALLETH IN WITH NEW FRIENDS\n\n\n\nWhen she next awoke, the sun was not yet high, and the morning young,\nyet she stood upon her feet much refreshed by that short slumber.\nShe turned toward the hill and the gay house, and saw one coming over\nthe meadow to her, a woman to wit, in a shining golden gown, and as\nshe drew nigh Birdalone could see that she was young and fair, tall,\nwhite-skinned and hazel-eyed, with long red hair dancing all about\nher as she tripped lightly and merrily over the greensward.\n\nNow she comes up to Birdalone with wonder in her eyes, and greets her\nkindly, and asked her of her name, and Birdalone told it all simply;\nand the new-comer said:  What errand hast thou hither, that thou art\ncome thus naked and alone in this ill-omened ferry?  Birdalone\ntrembled at her words, though she spake kindly to her, and she said:\nIt is a long story, but fate drave me thereto, and misery, and I knew\nnot whither I was bound.  But is there no welcome for me in this\nlovely land?  I lack not deftness wholly; and I will be a servant of\nservants, and ask no better if it must be so.  Said the new-comer:\nUnto that mayst thou come, but sore will be thy servitude.  I fear me\nthy welcome here may be but evil.  Said Birdalone:  Wilt thou not\ntell me how so?  Quoth that lady:  We know thy ferry here, that it is\nthe craft wherein cometh hither now and again the sister of our lady\nthe Queen, into whose realm thou art now come, and who liveth up in\nthe white palace yonder, and whom we serve.  And meseems thou wilt\nnot have come hither by her leave, or thou wouldst be in other guise\nthan this; so that belike thou wilt be the runaway of thy mistress.\nWherefore I fear that thou wilt be sent back to thy said mistress\nafter a while, and that that while will be grievous to thee, body and\nsoul.\n\nBirdalone's heart sank, and she was pale and trembling; but she said:\nO dear lady, might I then depart as I have come hither, without the\nwotting of this Queen! after thou hast given me a morsel of bread,\nfor I am hungry.  Said the gold-clad one, looking on her pitifully:\nNay, maiden, I cannot choose but bring thee before our mistress,\nwhereas most like she hath already seen thee from above there.  For\nshe is far-sighted beyond the wont of folk who be more manlike.  But\nas for the bread, see thou!  I have brought a manchet in my pouch,\nand cheese withal, as I came hurrying; for I thought, she will be\nhungry.  And she reached the victual out to her.  And Birdalone took\nit and kissed the golden lady's hands, and she might not refrain her\ntears, but wept as she ate.\n\nMeanwhile the golden lady spake unto her and said:  Nevertheless,\nthou poor maiden, somewhat may be done for thine helping, and I will\npresently speak to my sisters thereon, who are, both of them, wiser\nthan I.  Sisters by blood are we not, but by love and fellowship.\nAnd I doubt not but that as we go up into the house we shall happen\nupon them in the garden.  But now I look upon thee, how fair a woman\nart thou!\n\nThou art kind and friendly, said Birdalone, smiling amidst of her\ntears, might I know by what name to call so dear a woman?  Thou shalt\ncall me Aurea, said the other; and my next sister is Viridis, and the\nthird, Atra; for that is according to the hues of our raiment, and\nother names we have not now.  And lo! here cometh Viridis over the\nmeadow.\n\nBirdalone looked, and saw a woman coming toward them clad all in\ngreen, with a rose-wreath on her head.  And she drew nigh, and\ngreeted Birdalone kindly, and she also was a very beauteous woman;\nnot great of body, whereas Aurea was tall and big-made, though\nexcellently shapen.  Light brown and goodly waved of hair was\nViridis, her eyes brown, and rather long than great; her lips full\nand ruddy, her cheeks soft and sweet and smooth, and as rosy-tinted\npearl; her hands small and delicate of fashion; her whole body soft-\nshapen as an egg; a kind, wheedling look her face bore.\n\nWhen she had looked a while on Birdalone, she kissed her, and said:\nI would thou wert happier, for thou art beauteous, and all but the\nevil must love thee.  Therewith she drew a cate from her pouch, and\nsaid:  Eat somewhat, for thou wilt be hungry; and let us go meet our\nother sister, who is wiser than we.\n\nSo they went, all three of them, and came from off the meadow on to\nthe garden-slopes, and at the entry thereof was come Atra to meet\nthem; she was clad all in black, a tall, slim woman, with the grace\nof the willow-bough in the wind, with dark plenteous hair and grey\nhawk-eyes; her skin privet-white, with but little red in her cheeks.\nShe also greeted Birdalone kindly, but sadly withal.  She gave her\nstrawberries to eat laid on a big kale-blade; and she said:  Sisters,\nhere are we hidden by the trees, and cannot be seen from the house;\ntherefore we may sit here for a minute or two, while we talk together\nas to what may perchance be done for the helping of this unhappy\nmaiden, who is so fair and lovely, and hath strayed into so ugly a\ntrap.  Then she said to Birdalone:  Thou must know, poor wanderer,\nthat this Queen, our mistress, who is sister to the Witch Under the\nWood, is big and strong, well-made, and white-skinned, so that she\ndeems herself a Queen of all beauty:  keen-eyed is she to see a fly\nwhere others would see nought smaller than a coney; fine-eared\nwithal; wise in wizardry; not altogether dull-witted, though she be\nproud, and crueller than the cruellest.  But herein she faileth, that\nher memory is of the shortest for matters of the passing hour, albeit\nshe remembers her spells and witch-songs over well.  But other\nmatters will scarce abide in her head for four and twenty hours.\nWherefore, sisters, if we may keep this maiden out of her sight\n(after she hath seen her and given doom upon her) till the dead of\nto-morrow night, we may perchance do some good for her; and it is in\nmy mind that then she may do good for us also.\n\nNow they rejoiced in this word of Atra the wise; and Atra prayed\nBirdalone to tell them somewhat more of her story; and she told them\nmuch; but, whyso it were, she said nought concerning the wood-wife,\nwhose outward semblance was the same as hers.  Then they pitied her,\nand caressed her; but Atra said:  We must tarry here no more, but go\nstraight up to the lady, or maybe we shall lose all.\n\nSo they went their ways and came into the pleasance, and trod the\nsweet greensward betwixt the garland flowers and the beauteous trees;\nwhich now indeed, though Birdalone saw them all clear and over-clear,\nwere become nought to her.  Those three also spake gently to her, and\nnow and then asked her somewhat, as if to show her that she was one\nof themselves; but she spake not, or answered at random, and to say\nsooth scarce heard their words:  forsooth she was now become heart-\nsick, and was half dead for fear; and her nakedness, which would have\ntroubled her little across the water, was now grown a shame and a\nterror unto her, and every deal of her body quivered with the anguish\nthereof.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  BIRDALONE IS BROUGHT BEFORE THE WITCH-WIFE'S SISTER\n\n\n\nSo came they at last to the very house, and whereas it stood high on\nthe bent, a great stair or perron of stone went up to it, and was of\nmuch majesty.  They went through the porch, which was pillared and\nlovely, and into a great hall most nobly builded, and at the other\nend thereof, on a golden throne raised upon a dais, sat a big woman\nclad in red scarlet.  The three damsels led Birdalone to some four\npaces of the great lady, and then stood away from her, and left her\nstanding there alone, the scarlet-clad woman before her; on the right\nand the left the tall pillars going up gleaming toward the roof, and\nabout her feet the dark polished pavement, with the wallowing of\nstrange beasts and great serpents and dragons all done on the coal-\nblue ground.\n\nWhen she was so left alone, at first she tottered, and went nigh to\nfalling; but then came back some little heart to her, as she said to\nherself that now she should verily die once for all, and that no long\nwhile would be the passing from life into death.  She looked up and\nbeheld the lady-witch, that she was somewhat like to her sister,\nwhite-skinned and of plenteous golden-hair as was she, but younger of\naspect, and nowise so ill-looked as that other had now become; for\nsomewhat well-shapen of body she was; but her face forbidding; her\nlower lip thrust out, her cheeks flaggy and drooping, her eyes little\nmore than half open; to be short, a face both proud, foolish, and\ncruel; terrible indeed, sitting in judgment in that place on a\nshrinking naked creature.\n\nNow she spake; and if there were no majesty or solemnity in the\nvoice, there was ugly glee and malice therein; but she said to those\ndamsels:  Is this the woman that my keen eyes beheld come aland from\nmy sister's Sending Boat e'en now?  Aurea knelt on one knee, and\nsaid:  Yea, so please you, my lady.\n\nThen said the witch:  Ho thou!  Wilt thou plead some errand hither\nfrom my sister?  Dost thou deem me so witless as not to know that if\nshe had sent thee hither thou wouldst not have come in this plight?\nNay, I know; thou hast stolen thyself from her:  thou art a thief,\nand as a thief shalt thou be dealt with.\n\nSpake Birdalone in a clear voice:  No errand do I feign from thy\nsister, lady:  when I could bear my life there no longer, I took\noccasion to flee from her:  this is all the tale.  Yet once and again\nit hath been in my mind that it was thy sister who stole me from them\nthat loved me.\n\nHah, thrall! said the lady, thou art bold; thou art over-bold, thou\nnaked wretch, to bandy words with me.  What heed I thy tale now thou\nart under my hand?  Her voice was cold rather than fierce, yet was\nthere the poison of malice therein.  But Birdalone spake:  If I be\nbold, lady, it is because I see that I have come into the House of\nDeath.  The dying may well be bold.\n\nThe House of Death! cried the stupid lady; and wilt thou call my\nnoble house the House of Death?  Now art thou no longer bold,\nstripped thrall, but impudent.\n\nScorn rose into Birdalone's heart at this word, but she refrained\nher, and spake:  I meant that I have stirred the wrath in thee, and\nthat thou wilt slay me therefor; and that it availeth not to crave\nmercy of thee.\n\nLaughed the lady:  Thou art a fool, thrall, said she; if a sparrow\nfled hither from my sister, I should not wring its neck, but keep it\nfor her.  So shall I do with thee.  I shall not slay thee, and so\ndestroy my sister's chattel; nor shall I spoil thee, and spoil her\npossession.  I shall send thee back unto her, the stolen thrall in\nthe stolen boat, when I have learned thee a lesson here.  Forsooth it\nwas for that cause meseemeth that she let thee slip through her\nfingers, for she is wise enough to have stayed thee from this holiday\nhad she willed it.  But she is tender-hearted, and kind, and soft,\nand might well deem that if thy chastisement were done to her hand\nhere, it were better done than by her mercy.  Now, thrall, I have\nspoken enough to thee, or more than enough:  get thee back out of\nearshot!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  OF THE WITCH'S PRISON IN THE WAILING-TOWER\n\n\n\nBirdalone did as she was bidden, and the witch called unto her Atra,\nwho came and stood humbly on the footpace beside her, and held\nconverse with her mistress a while.  Then she went backward from her\na little, and then came to Birdalone, and in a somewhat harsh voice\nbade her come with her.  Birdalone followed her, quaking, and they\ncame out of the hall and into a long passage, which led to a wide\nstair winding round a newel; and all was builded exceeding fair, had\nBirdalone's heart suffered her eyes to see it; but her flesh was\nweak, and quaked before the torment to come, so that her knees well-\nnigh failed her.\n\nBut now Atra lays a hand kindly on her shoulder and stays her, and\nsays:  Now meseems the walls of the Wailing-Tower, for so it hight,\nhave no ears to hear, and we may talk together.  Wottest thou why I\nhave brought thee hither?  Said Birdalone in a faint voice:  Hast\nthou been bidden to whip me?  And if I had been so bidden, dear\nmaiden, said Atra laughing, nowise would I do it.  Hold up thine\nheart!  For all hath gone well so far, and now meseems betwixt us\nthree we shall save thee.\n\nBirdalone's spirit came back to her at that word, and she put her\nhands to her face and fell a-weeping.  But Atra was kind to her and\nmade much of her; and she kissed her and wiped her tears, and\nBirdalone smiled again amidst her sobs, and she thanked Atra; who\nsaid to her:  First of all I must tell thee that I am taking thee to\nprison by the witch's bidding.  Yea, said Birdalone, and what is\nprison?  Said Atra:  A prison is a grim place where poor folk who\nhave done that which pleaseth not rich folk are shut up, that they\nmay be grieved and tormented by not being able to fare abroad, or go\nwhere they would; and by suffering whatsoever their masters may lay\nupon them, as darkness, and cold, and hunger, and stripes.  Somewhat\nso, or worse, our lady would have it for thee; but so would not we.\nTherefore for thee shall this prison be a place where thou shalt be\nsafe till we may bring thee forth when the night hath worn towards\nits ending.  For she will have forgotten thee by to-morrow; and this\nshe knoweth; wherefore just now, when thou stoodest out of earshot,\nshe was bidding me, amongst other matters, to bring thee before her\nto-morrow morning, and tell her the tale of thee, that she might call\nit to mind then what she had will to this morning.\n\nYea, said Birdalone, but will she not remember that she hath given\nthee a charge concerning me?  But little thereof, said Atra, and with\na few words I may easily confuse her memory so that speech thereon\nwill fail her.  Keep up thine heart, sweetling; but let us up this\nstair now forthwith, for I were fain to have thee hid away in this\nprison, and then will I down to her and tell her that thou art lying\ntherein in all misery and terror, lest it come into her head to send\nfor thee ere her memory is grown dim.\n\nAgain did Birdalone take heart, and they hastened a long way up the\nstair, till Atra stayed at last at a door all done with iron, endlong\nand over-thwart.  Then she took a leash of keys from her girdle, one\nbig and two little, and set the big one in the lock and turned it,\nand shoved the heavy door and entered thereby a chamber four-square\nand vaulted; and the vault was upheld by a pillar of red marble,\nwherein, somewhat higher than a man's head, were set stanchions of\nlatten, that could be clasped and unclasped.  This chamber was in a\nway goodly, but yet grim to look on; for the walls were all of black\nashlar stone close-jointed, and the floor black also, but of marble\npolished so wholly that it was as dark water, and gave back the image\nof Birdalone's dear feet and legs as she went thereon.  The windows\nwere not small, and the chamber was light in every corner because of\nthem, but they were so high up under the vaulting that none might see\nthereout aught save the heavens.  There was nought in the chamber\nsave a narrow bench of oak and three stools of the same, a great and\nstately carven chair dight with cushions of purple and gold, and in\none corner a big oaken coffer.\n\nNow spake Atra:  This is our lady's prison, and I fear me we cannot\nmake it soft for thee, dear stranger.  Yea, I must tell thee (and she\nreddened therewith) that it is part of my charge to set thee in\nirons.  Birdalone smiled on her, and was over weary to ask what that\nmeant, though she knew not.  But Atra went to the big coffer and\nopened it and thrust in her hands, and there was a jangling\ntherewith, and when she turned about to Birdalone again she had iron\nchains in her hands, and she said:  This shameth me, dear friend; yet\nif thou wouldst wear them it might be well, for she may have a mind\nto go visit her prison, and if she find thee there unshackled she\nshall be wroth, and oftenest her wrath hath a whip in its hand.  And\nthese are the lightest that I might find.\n\nBirdalone smiled again, and spake not, for she was very weary, and\nAtra did the irons on her wrists and her ankles; and said thereafter:\nYet bear in mind that it is a friend that hath the key of these\nthings.  And now I will go away for a little, but I shall be on thine\nerrands; for first I shall tell the mistress that thou art lying here\nshackled and in all wanhope; and next, by the will and command of\nher, I am to see that thou be well fed and nourished to-day that thou\nmayst be the stronger for to-morrow.  Now if I may give thee rede, it\nis that thou forbear to open the coffer yonder; for ugly things shalt\nthou find there, and that may dishearten thee again.\n\nTherewith she kissed her kindly on the cheek and went her ways, and\nthe great key turned in the lock behind her.\n\nThere then was Birdalone left to herself; and she was over weary even\nto weep; true it is that she made a step or two towards the coffer,\nbut reframed her, and took two of the pillows from the great chair\nand turned aside into the other corner, her chains jingling as she\nwent.  There she laid herself down, and nestled into the very wall-\nnook, and presently fell asleep, and slumbered dreamlessly and\nsweetly a long while.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  THEY FEAST IN THE WITCH'S PRISON\n\n\n\nBirdalone was awakened by the sound of the key in the lock, and the\ndoor opened, and there was Atra bearing dishes and platters, and\nbehind her Viridis with the like gear, and beakers and a flagon to\nboot, and both they were smiling and merry.\n\nBirdalone's heart leapt up to meet them, and in especial was she\ngladdened by the coming of Viridis, who had seemed to be the kindest\nof them all.\n\nViridis spake:  Now is come the meat for the dear sister, and it is\ntime, for surely thou art famished, and it is now long past high\nnoon.  Do off her irons, Atra.  Said Atra:  Maybe it were well to let\nthe fetters abide on her ankles, lest the mistress should come; but\nfor the wrists, reach out thine hands, wayfarer.  So did Birdalone,\nand Atra laid her things on the ground, and unlocked the hand-\nshackles, and did them off:  and meanwhile Viridis spread forth the\nbanquet, partly on the floor, and partly on that ill-omened coffer.\nThen she went up to Birdalone and kissed her, and said:  Now shalt\nthou sit in our lady's throne, and we shall serve thee, and thou\nshalt deem thee a great one.\n\nNought else would they have, and Birdalone laid her nakedness on the\npurple cushions, and then they fell all three to the feast.  The\nvictual was both plenteous and dainty, of venison and fowl, and cream\nand fruits and sweetmeats, and good wine they had withal:  never had\nBirdalone feasted in like manner, and the heart came back unto her,\nand her cheeks grew rosy and her eyes glittered.  But she said:  How\nif your lady were to come upon us here, and we so merry?  Said Atra:\nOut of the chair must thou when thou hearest the key in the lock, and\nthen is all well, and she would have nought against us; for she\nherself bade us, and me in special, to keep thee company here, and\ntalk with thee; and Aurea also would have been here, but that she is\nserving the lady as now.  Hath she then some pity on me, said\nBirdalone, that she hath bidden thee do by me what is most to my\npleasure?\n\nLaughed Viridis thereat, and Atra said:  She hath no pity, nor ever\nshall have; but so hard of heart is she, that she may not deem that\nwe could love thee, a stranger, and unhappy, who can serve us in\nnowise; so she feareth not the abatement of thy grief from any\ncompassion of us.  Rather she hath sent us, and me in especial, not\nto comfort thee, but to grieve thee by words; for she biddeth me tell\nthee fair tales, forsooth, of what to-morrow shall be to thee, and\nthe day after; and of how she shall begin on thee, and what shall\nfollow the beginning, and what thou mayst look for after that.  For\nby all this she deemeth to lower thy pride and abate thy valour, and\nto make every moment of to-day a terror to thy flesh and thy soul, so\nthat thereby thou mayest thole the bitterness twice over.  Such is\nher pity for thee!  And yet belike this cruelty hath saved thee, for\nbut for that she had not refrained her from thee to-day, and to-\nmorrow thou shalt be far away from her.\n\nMeanwhile, said Viridis, in her soft sweet voice, none of all these\nthings will we talk over with thee, but things comfortable and kind;\nand we will tell each to each of our story.  Will we not, Atra?  Yea,\nverily, said she.\n\nBirdalone looked upon them and said:  Wondrous is your compassion and\nloving-kindness unto me, and scarce do I know how to bear the burden\nthereof.  But tell me one thing truly; will ye not suffer in my place\nwhen this witch cometh to know that ye have stolen me away from her?\n\nNay, said Atra, I have told thee that by to-morrow she will have\naltogether, or at least almost, forgotten thee and thy coming hither.\nMoreover, she is foreseeing, and hath come to know that if she raise\na hand against any of us three, it will lead her to her bane, save it\nbe for heavy guilt clearly proven against us.  Forsooth, in the\nearlier days of our captivity such a guilt we fell into, and did not\nwholly escape, as Viridis can bear me witness.  But we are now grown\nwiser, and know our mistress better, and will give her no such joy.\n\nViridis cast her eyes down at those words and Atra's smile, and\nturned red and then pale, and Birdalone looked on her wondering what\nailed her; then she said:  Do ye sisters work in the field and the\ngarden?  I mean at milking the kine and the goats, and digging the\nearth, and sowing and reaping, and the like.  Nay, said Atra; either\nour mistress or someone else who is of marvellous might, hath so\nordained, that here everything waxeth of itself without tillage, or\nsowing or reaping, or any kind of tending; and whatso we need of\nother matters the mistress taketh it for us from out of her Wonder-\ncoffer, or suffereth us to take it for ourselves.  For thou must know\nthat this land is one of the Isles of the Lake, and is called the\nIsle of Increase Unsought.\n\nMeseemeth then, said Birdalone, were the mistress of you to gainsay\nyou the gifts of the Wonder-coffer, ye were undone.  Yea, verily,\nsaid Atra; then would be but the fruits of the earth and the wild\ncreatures for our avail, and these, we have not learned how to turn\nthem into dinner and supper.  And they all laughed thereat; but\nBirdalone said:  See ye then how I was right to offer myself unto you\nas a servant, for in all matters of the house and the byre and the\nfield have I skill.  But since ye would not or could not have me, I\nwonder not that ye be ill at ease here, and long to be gone, for as\nplenteous and lovely as the isle is, and though ye live here without\npresent mishandling or pining.  For, sooth to say, ye have over you a\ntyrant and a fool.\n\nViridis answered:  Yet is there something else, dear friend, that\nwhets our longing to depart.  Tell her thereof, Atra.\n\nAtra smiled and said:  Simple it is:  there are they who long for us\nand for whom we long, and we would be together.  Said Birdalone:  Be\nthese kinsfolk of yours, as fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, or\nthe like?\n\nReddened Viridis again; but Atra spake, and she also blushed\nsomewhat, though she smiled:  Those whom we love, and who love us, be\nnot queans, but carles; neither be they of our blood, but aliens,\ntill love overcometh them and causeth them to long to be of one flesh\nwith us; and their longing is beyond measure, and they desire our\nbodies, which they deem far fairer than belike they be.  And they\nwould bed us, and beget children on us.  And all this we let them do\nwith a good will, because we love them for their might, and their\ntruth, and the hotness of their love toward us.\n\nLooked up Viridis thereat, and her eyes gleamed amidst the flushing\nof her cheeks, and she said:  Sister, sister! even in such wise, and\nno other, as they desire us do we desire them; it is no mere good\nwill toward them from us, but longing and hot love.\n\nNow must Atra blush no less than Viridis; yet she but said:  I have\ntold thee hereof, Birdalone, because I deem that thou hast lived\nsimply and without the sight of men; but it is what all know in the\nworld of the sons of Adam.  Said Birdalone:  Thou sayest sooth\nconcerning me.  Yet about this love have I learned somewhat even ere\nto-day, and now, as ye speak and I, meseems the lore of it comes\npouring in on me and fills my heart with its sweetness.  And O, to\nhave such love from any, and with such love to be loved withal!\n\nDear sister, said little Viridis, fear not; such as thou shall not\nfail of the love of some man whom thou must needs love.  Is it not\nso, sister Atra?  Said Atra:  Yea; such love shall come unto her as\nsurely as death.\n\nThey were silent now a little, and it was as if some sweet incense\nhad been burned within the chamber.  For Birdalone the colour came\nand went in her cheeks, her flesh quaked, her heart beat quick, and\nshe was oppressed by the sweetness of longing.  More daintily she\nmoved her limbs, and laid foot to foot and felt the sleekness of her\nsides; and tender she was of her body as of that which should one day\nbe so sorely loved.\n\nNow she spake timidly to the others, and said:  Each one of you then\nhas a man who loves her, and longs for her and for none else?  So it\nis, said Viridis.  How sweet that shall be! said Birdalone; and now\nall the more I wonder that ye could trouble yourselves over me, or\nthink of me once; and the kinder I think it of you.\n\nSaid Atra smiling on her:  Nay, now must the cat be out of the bag,\nand I must tell thee that thou art to think of us as chapmen who with\nour kindness would buy something of thee, to wit, that thou wouldst\ndo an errand for us to those three lovers of ours.  Surely, said\nBirdalone, it were a little payment to set against your saving of my\nlife and my soul; and had I to go barefoot over red gleeds I would do\nit.  And yet, if I may go hence to your lovers, why not all three of\nyou along with me?\n\nSaid Atra:  For this reason; thy ferry, the Sending Boat, wherein ye\ncame hither, is even somewhat akin to thy mistress and ours; and the\nmistress here hath banned it against bearing us; and now, were we so\nmuch as to touch it, such sore turmoil would arise, and such hideous\nnoise as if earth and heaven were falling together; and the lady\nwould be on us straightway, and we should be undone; and, as thou\nshalt hear presently, this hath been proved.  But thou, thou art free\nof the said ferry.  Forsooth I wot not why thy mistress banned it not\nagainst thee; maybe because she deemed not that thou wouldst dare to\nuse it or even go anigh it.\n\nBirdalone considered, and thought that even so it was; that the witch\ndeemed that she would not dare use the Sending Boat, nor know how to,\neven if she came upon it, and that if she did so find it, she would\nsicken her of the road thereto.  So now she told her friends the\nwhole tale thereof more closely than she had afore, save again what\npertained to Habundia; withal she told every word of what her\nmistress had said to her at that time when she changed her into a\nhind.  And Viridis heard and wondered, and pitied her.  But Atra sat\nsomewhat downcast a while.  Then she said:  However this may be, we\nwill send thee forth to-morrow in the dawn, and take the risk of what\nmay befall thereafter; and thou shalt bear a token for each of those\nthree that love us.  For we deem that they have not forgotten aught,\nbut are still seeking us.\n\nBirdalone said:  Whatsoever ye bid me; that will I do, and deem me\nyour debtor still.  But now I pray you, pleasure a poor captive\nsomewhat more.  Wherein? said they both; we be all ready thereto.\nSaid the maiden:  Would ye do so much as to tell me the tale of how\nye came hither, and then how it hath been with you from your first\ncoming until now?  With a good will, said Atra; hearken!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.  ATRA TELLS OF HOW THEY THREE CAME UNTO THE ISLE OF\nINCREASE UNSOUGHT\n\n\n\nWe were born and bred in the land that lies south-west along this\nGreat Water, and we waxed happily, and became fellows when we were\nyet but children, and thus grew up dear friends into maidenhood and\nwomanhood.  We were wooed by many men, but our hearts turned to none\nof them save unto three, who were goodly, kind, and valiant; and thou\nmayst call them the Golden Knight, who is Aurea's man; the Green\nKnight, who is man of Viridis; and my man, the Black Squire.  But in\nthis was unhap, that because of certain feuds which had endured from\nold time, this love was perilous unto them and us; so that we lived\nin doubt and unrest.\n\nCame a day, now three years ago, when the king of the whole land\nbrought his folk into our lakeside country, and there held a court\nand a mote in a fair great meadow anigh to the water.  But even as\nthe mote was hallowed, and the Peace of God proclaimed at the blast\nof the war-horn, came we three woeful ladies clad in black and knelt\nbefore the lord king, and prayed him hearken us.  And he deemed that\nwe were fair, so he had compassion on us, and raised us up, and bade\nus speak.\n\nSo we told our tale, how that strife and wounds and death stood\nbetwixt us and love; and we wept, and bewailed it, that our love must\nbe slain because men were wroth with each other and not with us.\n\nThe king looked on us kindly, and said:  Who be the swains for whom\nthese lovely damsels make such a piece of work?  So we named them,\nand said that they were there in the mote; and the king knew them for\nvaliant men who had done him good service; and he cried out their\nnames, and bade them stand forth out of the throng.  So forth they\nstood, the Golden Knight, the Green Knight, and the Black Squire (and\nhe also was now a knight); but now were they all three clad in black,\nand they were unarmed, save for their swords girt to their sides,\nwithout which no man amongst us may come to the mote, be he baron or\nearl or duke, or the very lord king himself.\n\nSo the king looked upon us and them, and laughed and said:  Fair\nladies, ye have got me by the nose, so needs must my body follow.  Do\nye three knights, whom I know for valiant men and true, take each his\nlove by the hand, and let the weddings be to-morrow.  Who then were\njoyful but us?  But even at the word the king spake arose great\nturmoil in the mote, for they smote the feud and contention awake,\nand men thronged forward against each other, and swords were drawn\nand brandished.  But the king arose in his place and spake long and\ndeftly, and waxed exceeding wroth, while none heeded him nor\nhearkened.  And there stood our three men, who laid no hand to hilt,\nbut abode heart-whole by seeming amid the tumult.  And lovely they\nwere to look on.  At last the wise men and old barons went between,\nand by fair words appeased the trouble, and the mote grew hushed.\nThen spake the king:  What is this, my thanes?  I had deemed that my\nfoemen were far away, and that ye that here are were all friends unto\nme and unto each other.  But now must we try another rede.  Therewith\nhe turned unto our men and said:  Ye champions, are ye so much in\nlove with Love that ye will fight for him?  They all yeasaid that,\nand then the king said:  Then do I declare that these three will hold\nthe field against all comers from matins till high noon, and that he\nwho vanquisheth any one of them shall have his lady and wed her if he\nwill, and, if he will, shall ransom her.  And this field shall be\nfoughten after two months' frist in these fair meadows, when I return\nfrom the outermost marches of the south, whereto I am now wending.\nBut when the battle is done, then let all men bow to the judgment of\nGod, whether he be well content or not, and this on peril of life and\nlimb.  And now let there be deep peace between all men meanwhile; and\nif any break the peace, be he high or low, rich or unrich, churl or\nearl, I swear it by the souls of my fathers that he shall lose nought\nsave his life therefor.\n\nAt these words was there a rumour of yeasay, and all men were\ncontent, save we three poor maidens, into whose hearts had now\nentered fear of loss and death.\n\nBut our kindreds on both sides were glad and proud, and they were not\nso bitter against us as they had been; they put hand to pouch, and\nlet rear for us a fair pavilion of painted timber, all hung with silk\nand pictured cloths and Saracen tapestry, by the very lake-side; and\ngay boats gaily bedight lay off the said pavilion for our pleasure;\nand when all was done, it yet lacked a half month of the day of\nbattle, and thither were we brought in triumph by the kindreds on a\nfair day of May, and there was not a sword or a spear amongst the\nwhole company, and peaceful and merry was all by seeming.  But we\nwere not suffered to meet our lovers all this while, from the time\nwhen the mote was.\n\nNow on a day came a messenger on the spur, and did us to wit that the\nking would be with us on the morrow, and that the day after, the\nfateful field should be foughten.  Then, though the coming of this\nday had been so longed for by us, yet now it was at hand it cast us\ninto all unrest and trouble, so that we scarce knew whether to go, or\nstand, or sit, or what to do with our bodies.  Our folk, and all\nother men withal, were so busy making ready for the morrow of to-\nmorrow, that they left us alone to wear through the day as we might.\n\nNow it was afternoon, and the day hot and hazy, and we stood on the\nvery lip of the land wearied with hope and fear, and striving to keep\ngood countenance to each other; and there came a boat unto the shore\ngaily painted and gilded, and bedight with silken cloths and\ncushions; and the steerer thereof was a woman, not young, by seeming\nof fifty winters; red-haired she was, thin-lipped and narrow-eyed,\nflat-breasted and strait-hipped; an ungoodly woman, though her skin\nwas white and smooth as for her age.  Hast thou ever seen such an\none, guest?  Said Birdalone, smiling:  Forsooth that have I; for such\nan one is my mistress to behold.\n\nWell, said Atra, this dame stretched out her hands to us, and said:\nWill not the pretty ladies, the dear ladies, who have nought on hand\nthis afternoon, come into my boat and look on the face of the water,\nso calm and fair as it is, and let their lovely hands go over the\ngunwale and play with the ripple, and so beguile this heavy time for\na two hours; and then give a little gift of a piece or two of silver\nto a poor carline, who loveth all fair ladies and bright warriors,\nand who needeth a little livelihood?\n\nNow the woman seemed nought lovely unto us, and to me forsooth she\nseemed hateful; but we looked on each other, and we found that we\nwere utterly weary of going up and down on the meadow, and lying\nabout in the pavilion, and it seemed as if this would give us a\nlittle rest; withal we saw not that the woman could do us any hurt,\nwhereas we were three, and strong enough as women go; nor were we\nmariners so evil but that we might sail or steer a boat at a pinch.\nSo we stepped into the boat straightway, and the woman sat aft and\npaddled deftly with the steering oar, and we glided away from the\nland.\n\nSoon we were come so far that we could but just see our pavilion\nthrough the haze, which had somewhat thickened, and we said to the\nwoman that she should go about and make for the shore, and that then\nwe would go to and fro a while along by our stead.  She nodded\nyeasay, and began by seeming to dight the craft for return.  But\ntherewith the haze was grown suddenly into a low cloud, which came\ndown upon us from the south-west in the arms of a cold breeze, that\ngrew stronger every minute, so no wonder it was though the steerer\nmight not keep head to wind; and then who was afraid and ashamed save\nourselves?\n\nBut the woman said, and there seemed to be a mock in her voice:  Ill\nluck, pretty ladies!  Now is there nought for it but to drive, if we\nwould not drown.  But belike this duskiness will clear presently, and\nthen at least we shall know whither we be going; and we may either\nturn back, or seek some other shelter, for I know the lake well; I\nknow, I know.\n\nWe were too terror-stricken to speak, for we felt that still the wind\ngrew stronger, and the lake began to rise into waves, and the craft\nto wallow; but well-nigh therewith was the dusk and the mist gone;\nthe sky was bright blue overhead, and the westering sun shone\ncloudless; but on no land it shone, or on aught save the blue waters\nand the white wave-crests.\n\nThen wept Aurea, and this Viridis here, but as to me, I grew wroth\nand cried out to the steerer:  Accursed carline! thou hast betrayed\nus; never now may we get back to our pavilion till the fight is\nfoughten, and our lovers will deem that we have forsaken them, and we\nare shamed for ever.  Well, well, said the carline, what remedy save\npatience for the winds and waves?  And she laughed mockingly.  Quoth\nI:  There is this remedy, that we three arise and lay hands on thee,\nand cast thee outboard, save thou straightway turn the boat's head\nand back to the main.  Forsooth I doubt not but that as thou hast\nraised this foul wind against us, thou canst raise a fair wind for\nus.\n\nHearken to the lovely lady! quoth the carline, how she deemeth me to\nbe none other than the great God himself, to hold the winds in the\nhollow of my hand, and still the waves with a word!  What! am I\nwrought somewhat after his image, kind ladies?  And she grinned\nhorribly therewith.  Then she said again:  As to thy remedy,\nsweetling, meseemeth it nought.  For how shall ye sail this stormy\nwater when your captain is gone, and ye but holiday sailors belike?\n\nAs she spake, a great wave came up from the windward, and brake over\nus, and half filled the craft, and lifted her bows up towering, and\nthen down we went into the trough; and I sat cowed and quaking, and\nspake never another word.\n\nNow began the sun to sink, and the wind abated, and the sea went\ndown, but the boat sped on as swift as ever over the landless waters.\n\nNow the sun was down, and dusk was at hand, and the carline spake,\nand drew a bright-gleaming sax from under her raiment:  Damsels, I\nwarn you that now it were best that ye obey me in all things; for\nthough ye be three and I one, yet whereas I have here an edge-friend,\nI may take the life of any one of you, or of all three, as simply as\nI could cut a lamb's throat.  Moreover it will serve you better in\nthe house whereto ye are wending, that I make a good tale of you\nrather than a bad.  For the mistress of that house is of all might;\nand I must say it of her, though she is my very sister, yet she is\nnot so sweet-tempered and kind of heart as I am, but somewhat rough\nand unyielding of mood, so that it is best to please her.  Wherefore,\nmaidens, I rede you be sage.\n\nOur unhappy hearts were now so sunken in wan-hope, that we had no\nword wherewith to answer her, and she spake:  Now obey ye my bidding\nand eat and drink, that ye may come hale and sound to your journey's\nend, for I would not give starvelings to my dear sister.  Therewith\nshe brought forth victual for us, and that nought evil, of flesh and\nbread, and cheese and cakes, and good wine withal; and we were\nhunger-weary as well as sorrow-weary; and hunger did at that moment\novercome sorrow, so we ate and drank, and, would we, would we not,\nsomething of heart came back to us thereby.  Then again spake the\ncarline:  Now my will is that ye sleep; and ye have cushions and\ncloths enough to dight you a fair bed; and this bidding is easy for\nyou to obey.  Forsooth, so weary were we with sorrow, and our hunger\nwas now quenched, that we laid us down and slept at once, and forgat\nour troubles.\n\nWhen we awoke it was after the first dawn, and we were come aland\neven where thou didst this morning, guest.  And thou mayst deem it\nwondrous, but so it was, that close to where our boat took land lay\nthe ferry which brought thee hither.\n\nNow the carline bade us get ashore, and we did so, and found the land\nwondrous fair, little as that solaced us then.  But she said unto us:\nHearken! now are ye come home; and long shall ye dwell here, for\nnever shall ye depart hence save by the will of my sister and me,\nwherefore, once more, I rede you be good, for it will be better for\nyou.  Go forth now unto yonder house, and on the way ye shall meet\nthe Queen of this land, and ye have nought to do but to say to her\nthat ye are the Gift; and then shall she see to your matter.\n\nTherewith she gat into her own craft, the Sending Boat, and therein\ndid the deed and spake the words ye wot of, and was gone north-away;\nand when we turned to seek for our boat wherein we had come hither,\nit was gone.\n\nWe stood miserably for a while on the lip of the land, and then I\nsaid that we might as well go meet our fate as die there of grief and\nhunger.  So we went, and came into those fair gardens, and as we went\nslowly up toward the house came on us a woman clad in red scarlet and\ngrandly dight.  A big woman she was, and like to her that beguiled\nus, but far younger and fairer of favour, foolish and proud of\nvisage.  She stared on us, and seemed half afeard of us at first, but\nasked us what we were, and I answered that we were the Gift.  The\nGift? said she, what meaneth that?  Will ye obey me in all things?\nIf ye gainsay it, ye will perish, unless ye can eat grass; for on\nthis isle everything cometh from my hand.\n\nWhat might we do?  We all knelt down before her, and swore to do her\nwill.  Then she said, after she had stared on us a while:  Now I\nknow:  ye are they of whom my sister spake, that she would fetch me a\ngift of a leash of damsels for my service.  Now I take the Gift and\nthank her good heart.  But if ye would do my will, then . . .  But\nshe broke off here and stared at us a long while, and then she said:\nNow I know; she bade me treat you well, and hold my hand from you, or\nevil would come of it, belike at last my bane.  So go ye home to the\nhouse, and I will give you meat and drink, and show you my stores and\nthe Wonder-coffer, and ye shall serve me in honour.\n\nEven so did we; and we ate and drank and rested, and nought we\nlacked, save leave to depart home to our lovers, and some mistress\nbetter than this stupid and proud lump of flesh.  But the next\nmorning when we came before the lady, she knew nought of what we\nwere; and again we had to tell her that we were the Gift, and again\nshe glared at us balefully, and again she called to mind her sister\nand her rede concerning us.  And this went on for many days, till at\nlast she got to know what we were; and she followed her sister's rede\nin that she never mishandled us, though we could see that it irked\nher to forbear, nor did she speak to us more roughly than her fool's\nwont was; and we had in our hands all that was needed for our\nsustenance, and lived easily enough.\n\nNow our coming hither betid three years ago, and a month thereafter\ncomes thy witch hither in her ferry, and she greeted us when we met,\nand asked us, grinning, had she not been kind to win us such good\ndays?  Yea, and over kind, said she, ye would deem me, knew ye what\nwould have betid you save for my good word.  Forsooth we deemed it no\nkind deed to steal us from our lovers; but we kept good tongues in\nour heads, for thralls must needs kiss the rod.\n\nShe went away in two days, but came again many times thereafter, till\nwe won the secret of the Sending Boat, and her spell therewith; but\nwe knew not that was banned against us.  Wherefore on a day in the\ngrey of the morning, when we had been on this isle somewhat less than\na year, we went down to it and stepped in, and reddened stem and\nstern and said the spell-words.  But straightway arose an hideous\nbraying and clatter, and thunder came therewith, and trembling of the\nearth, and the waters of the lake arose in huge waves; nor might we\nmove from our seats in the boat till the two witches came running\ndown to us, and haled us out ashore, and had us up into the house,\nand into this very prison-chamber, wherein we are now sitting so\nmerry.  And here we bore what was laid upon us, whereof, dear guest,\nwe shall tell thee nought.  But this came of it, that never\nthereafter durst we try the adventure of the Sending Boat, but have\nlived on in lazy sorrow and shameful ease, till thou, dear guest and\nsister, wert sent hither by heaven for our helping.\n\nNow what became of the king's court, and the hazelled field of our\nchampions, we wot not, or whether they be yet alive we cannot tell\nthee; but if they be alive, it is to them that we would have thee do\nour errand, and thereof will we tell thee closely to-morrow.  And so,\nsweetling, an end of my tale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.  THE THREE DAMSELS TAKE BIRDALONE OUT OF THE WITCH'S\nPRISON\n\n\n\nBirdalone thanked Atra much for her tale, and strange it was to her\nto hear of such new things and the deeds of folk; but the dealing of\nthe witches with those three was familiar to her and was of her\nworld.\n\nNow they talked merrily, till there came a footstep to the door and\none without knocked.  Viridis paled thereat, and a pang of fear smote\nBirdalone, and she swiftly got from out the chair and sat down on a\nstool; but when Atra opened, it was but Aurea come from her service\nto bid Atra take her place.  So she went, and again was there\npleasant converse betwixt Aurea and the other twain; and certain\nmatters did Aurea tell Birdalone which had been left untold by Atra.\nAnd chiefly, when Birdalone asked if any other folk had come into the\nisle while they dwelt there, she said yea; once had come a knight\nwith a lady, his love, fleeing from war and mishap, and these had the\nwitch overcome by wizardry, and destroyed them miserably:  and that\nagain another had strayed thither, and him also the witch undid,\nbecause he would not do her will and lie in her bed.  Withal had come\ndrifting there a young damsel, a castaway of the winds and waves; her\nthe witch kept as a thrall, and after a while took to mishandling her\nso sorely, that at last, what for shame and what for weariness of\nlife, she cast herself into the water and was drowned.  None of these\nfolk might the damsels help so as to do them any good, though they\ntried it, and went nigh to suffer therefor themselves.\n\nNow the day wore, and in a while Atra came back, and Viridis must\nserve.  At last the dusk and the dark was come.  Then said Atra:  Now\nmust we twain begone to wait upon our lady, as the wont is:  and that\nis now for our good hap, for if we be with her all three, and\nespecially, to say sooth, if I be with her, we may well keep her from\nvisiting thee here; since belike she shall yet dimly remember that\nthou art in her prison.  Therefore thou must forgive it if I shackle\nthy wrists again.  And now if thou wilt follow my rede, thou shalt\ntry to sleep some deal, and it were well if thou might'st sleep till\nwe come for thee in the grey dawn.\n\nTherewith they left her there, and she nestled in the corner once\nmore, and there did verily fall asleep, and slept till the key in the\nlock and the opening door awakened her, and Atra came stealing soft-\nfooted into the prison.  Eager she was and panting, and she kneeled\nbefore Birdalone and unlocked her leg-shackles, and then stood up and\ndid the like by the irons on her wrists.  Then she said:  Look up,\ndear friend, to thy prison windows, and behold the dawn beginning to\nbreak on the day of thy deliverance, and ours maybe.  But come now at\nonce:  and again, wilt thou pardon me, that we clothe thee not here\nfor thy journey?  For from our own bodies must we clothe thee, and if\nby any hap our lady were to see any one of us more or less unclad, it\nmight draw her on to see what was toward, and we might yet be found\nout, for our undoing.\n\nTherewith she took her hand, and led her forth of the prison, and\nlocked the door behind her; and then downstairs they went, and out-a-\ndoors by a little wicket at the stair-end.  The dawn drew on apace\nnow, and Birdalone saw at once the other twain lurking in the wall-\nnook hard by.  No word was spoken between them, and with noiseless\nfeet they went forth into the orchard, where the blackbirds and\nthrushes were beginning their first morning song, and ere they came\nout on to the meadow the full choir of them was a-singing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.  IN WHAT WISE BIRDALONE WAS CLAD, AND HOW SHE WENT HER\nWAYS FROM THE ISLE OF INCREASE UNSOUGHT\n\n\n\nWhen they were all clear of the orchard trees the three damsels kept\nBirdalone between them closely, so that her white body should not be\nseen if the lady were awake and looking forth.  Thus they brought her\nto where a few thorn-bushes made a cover for them close to the\nwater's edge, some twenty yards from the Sending Boat.  There they\nstood together, and Atra said:\n\nNow, dear guest, and dearest messenger, it is our matter to clothe\nthee from our very bodies; and do thou, Viridis, begin.\n\nViridis came forward blushing, as her wont was, and took off her\ngreen gown and laid it on the grass; then she set her hand to her\nsmock, and did it off, and stood naked, knee set to knee, and swaying\nlike the willow branch; and then was seen all the dainty fashion of\nher body, and how lovely of hue and sweet of flesh she was.\n\nBut she said:  Dear sister Birdalone, here is my smock, which I lend\nthee, but as to my love, I give it thee therewith; therefore grudge\nit not, though thou give me back the linen, for happy will be the day\nto me when I have it again; for now none may do it on me save the\nGreen Knight, my own love.  Therewith she gave her the smock, and\nkissed her, and Birdalone did it on, and felt the valianter and\nmightier when she had a garment upon her.\n\nThen Aurea did off her golden gown, and stood in smock alone, so that\nher naked arms shone more precious than the golden sleeves that had\ncovered them.  And she spake:  Birdalone, dear messenger, take now my\ngolden gown, and send it back to me when thou hast found the man unto\nwhom it is due; and think meanwhile that, when thou wearest it, thou\nwearest my love, and that when thou pullest it off, thou art clad\nwith my love instead of it.\n\nSo Birdalone did on the gown, and became to look on as the daintiest\nof the queens of the earth; and she turned her head about to look on\nher gold-clad flanks, and wondered.\n\nThereafter Atra knit up her skirts into her girdle, and then did off\nher shoon, so that her slim feet shone like pearls on the green\ngrass; and she said:\n\nBirdalone, sweet friend! wilt thou be my messenger to bear these\nshoon to my Black Squire, and meanwhile put my love for thee under\nthy feet, to speed thee and to bear thee up?  Wherefore be good to\nme.\n\nBirdalone then shod herself, and though pity it were to hide her feet\nfrom the eyes of Earth, yet felt she the stouter-hearted thereby, and\nher cheeks flushed and her eyes brightened.\n\nThereafter Aurea gave her withal a golden collar for the neck, and\nViridis a girdle of silver well-wrought, and Atra a gold finger-ring\nset with a sapphire stone; and all these she did on her; but yet she\nknew that they were tokens to be delivered to the three lovers\naccording as was due.\n\nThen spake Atra:  Lo, sister, we pray thee to bear these lendings on\nthy body in such wise that when thou comest to the mainland they may\nbe seen by knights seeking adventures, and that thou mayst answer to\nany who may challenge thee thereof and say that thou bearest this\nraiment and these jewels from Aurea and Viridis and Atra to Baudoin\nthe Golden Knight, and to Hugh the Green Knight, and to Arthur the\nBlack Squire.  And if thou deem that thou hast found these, then\nshall they tell thee a token, such as we shall tell thee, that they\nbe truly these and none other; and thereafter, when thou art made\nsure, they shall take of thee the raiment, the gems, and the Sending\nBoat, and come hither if they may.  And God look to the rest!  But as\nfor the token to be told aforesaid, we have determined that each of\nus shall tell thee privily what question thou shalt ask for her, and\nwhat answer thou must look for.\n\nWhen she had done speaking, each came up to Birdalone and spake\nsomething into her ear amidst blushes enough forsooth.  And what they\nsaid will be seen hereafter.  Then again said Atra:  Now by this\nerrand shall we be well paid for the care we have had of thee.  It\nmay be, forsooth, that thou shalt not find our speech-friends; for\nthey may be dead, or they may deem us untrue, and may have forsaken\nus and their land; and in any such case thou art free of our errand;\nbut whatsoever may betide us, God speed thee!\n\nThen Viridis drew forth a basket from under a bush, and said:  We\nknow not how long thy voyage may be, but some little provision for\nthe way we may at least give thee:  now wilt thou bear this aboard\nthyself; for we dare not touch thy craft, nay, nor come nigh it, no\none of us.  And she set down the basket and cast her arms about her,\nand kissed her and wept over her; and the other twain, they also\nkissed her lovingly.  Birdalone wept even as Viridis, and said:  May\nye do well, who have been so kind to me; but now am I both so glad\nand so sorry, that the voice of me will not make due words for me.  O\nfarewell!\n\nTherewith she took up her basket, and turned and went speedily to the\nSending Boat; and they beheld her how she stepped aboard and bared\nher arm, and drew blood from it with the pin of her girdle-buckle,\nand therewith reddened stem and stern; and a pang of fear smote into\ntheir hearts lest their lady had banned it for Birdalone as for them.\nBut Birdalone sat down on the thwart, and turned her face south, and\nspake:\n\n\nThe red raven-wine now\nHast thou drunk, stern and bow;\nAwake then, awake!\nAnd the southward way take:\nThe way of the Wender forth over the flood,\nFor the will of the Sender is blent with the blood.\n\n\nNo cloud barred the gateway of the sun as she spoke; no wave rose\nupon the bosom of the lake; no clatter nor tumult was there; but the\nSending Boat stirred, and then shot out swiftly into the wide water;\nand the sun arose as they looked, and his path of light flashed on\nBirdalone's golden gown for a moment, and then it grew grey again,\nand presently she was gone from before their eyes.\n\nSo they turned up into the orchard:  and now was Viridis of good\ncheer, and Aurea no less; but Atra lagged behind, and as she went,\nsome passion took her, she knew not wherefore; her bosom swelled, her\nshoulders heaved therewith, and she wept.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.  HOW BIRDALONE CAME TO THE ISLE OF THE YOUNG AND THE OLD\n\n\n\nAll went well with Birdalone when she had left the Isle of Increase\nUnsought, much as it had on her first voyage, save that now she was\nboth clad and victualled, and her heart, if yet it harboured fear,\nwas also full of new and strange hope; and oft, even as she sat there\namidst the waste of waters, she wondered what new longing this was\nwhich wrought so sweet a pain in her, that it made her cheeks burn,\nand her eyes dim, and her hands and her limbs restless.  And then\nwould she set her mind to her friends and their errand, and would\nhope and pray for them; but again would she fall to picture to\nherself what manner of men they were who were so sore longed for by\nthose three beauteous women; and she deemed that since they were thus\ndesired, they must be fairer even than her friends of the isle; and\nagain the nameless longing overtook her, and held her till it wearied\nher into sleep.\n\nWhen she awoke again the boat had stayed, and she was come aland; but\nthe dawn was not yet come, and the night was moonless, yet was there\nlight enough to see, from the water and the stars, that the bows of\nthe boat were lying safe on a little sandy beach.  So she stepped out\nand looked around, and deemed she could see great trees before her,\nand imagined also dark masses of she knew not what.  So she walked\nwarily up the said strand till she came on to soft grass, and smelled\nthe scent of the clover as her foot-soles crushed it.  There she sat\ndown, and presently lay along and went to sleep.\n\nAfter a while she awoke, and felt happy and well at ease, and had no\nwill to move:  the sun was shining brightly, but had not been up\nlong:  the song of birds was all about her, but amidst it she deemed\nshe heard some speech of man, though it were not like to what she had\nheard in her life before.  So she raised herself on her elbow, and\nlooked up and saw a new thing, and sat up now, and beheld and\nwondered.\n\nFor there stood before her, gazing wide-eyed on her, two little\nchildren, some three winters of age, a man and a woman as it seemed.\nThe man-child with light and fine white-golden hair, falling straight\ndown and square over his brow, and blue-grey eyes which were both\nkind and merry, and shyly seeking as it were.  Plump and rosy he was,\nsturdy and stout-limbed.  No less fair was the woman; her hair\ngolden-brown, as oft it is with children who grow up dark-haired, and\ncurling in fair little rings all over her head; her eyes were big and\ndark grey; she was thinner than the lad, and somewhat taller.\n\nThese two babes had between them a milk-white she-goat, and had been\nplaying with her, and now she turned her head to this and that one of\nthem, bleating, as if to crave more of the game; but they had no eyes\nfor her, but stood staring with might and main on the new-comer and\nher shining golden gown.\n\nBirdalone laughed with joy when she saw the little ones, and a dim\nmemory of the days of Utterhay passed before her:  she stretched out\na hand to them, and spake softly and caressingly, and the little lad\ncame forward smiling, and took her hand, and made as if he would help\nher up for courtesy's sake.  She laughed on him, and arose; and when\nshe stood up, tall and golden, he seemed somewhat afeard of so big a\ncreature, but stood his ground valiantly.  Then she stooped down to\nhim and kissed him, and he naysaid her not, but seemed rather glad\nwhen it was over; but when Birdalone went to the little maid, and\nkissed her, the child clung to her as if she were her mother, and\nbabbled to her.\n\nThen comes the lad to her, and takes her hand, and would draw her\naway, and speaks to her in his prattle, and she understood him to\nmean that she should come with him to see the father.  So she went,\nwondering what should next betide; and the little maiden went on the\nother side of her, holding by a fold of her skirt.  Forsooth the goat\nfollowed bleating, not well pleased to be forgotten.\n\nNow had Birdalone time to look about her, though the two babes fell\nto prattling with her in their way, and she thought it sweet to look\ndown on the two little faces that looked up to her so pleased and\nmerry.\n\nShe was in a grassy plain, somewhat over rough and broken to be\ncalled a meadow, and not enough be-timbered to be called a wood; it\nrose up a little and slowly as they left the water, but scarce so\nmuch as one might call it a hill.  Straight before her on the way\nthat they were going went up into the air great masses of grey stone\nbuilded by man's hand, but looking, even from this way off, ragged\nand ruinous.  It may well be thought that Birdalone wondered what\nthings might lie betwixt the trees and the towers.\n\nNow as they went they came on other goats, who seemed tame, and these\njoined them to their fellow, and suffered the younglings to play with\nthem.  Moreover there were rabbits great plenty scuttling in and out\nof the brakes and the rough ground upon the way, and the younglings\nbeheld them, and the little lad said, after his fashion:  Why do the\nrabbits run away from us, and the goats follow us?  Now, sooth to\nsay, Birdalone scarce knew why, and had no word ready for the child;\nbut she said at last:  Mayhappen they will come to me; so it was once\nwhen I dwelt away from here.  Shall I go fetch thee one?  The little\nones yeasaid that, though somewhat shyly and doubtfully.  Then said\nBirdalone:  Do ye, sweetlings, abide me here, and go not away.  They\nnodded their heads thereat, and Birdalone kilted her skirts and went\nher ways to some broken bushed ground, where was a many rabbits\nplaying about; but she went not out of eye-shot of the babes.  Before\nshe was well-nigh to the little beasts, she fell to talking to them\nin a low sweet voice, as had been her wont when she was little; and\nwhen they heard it, those who had not scuttled away at first glance\nof her, fell to creeping little short creeps one to the other, as\ntheir manner is when they be alone together and merry; and they\nsuffered her to come quite amongst them, and crept about her feet\nwhile she stood, still talking unto them.  Then she stooped down and\ntook up one in her arms and caressed it, and then laid him down and\ntook up another, and so with three or four of them; and she fell to\npushing them, and rolling them over with her foot; then she turned a\nlittle away from them toward the children, and then a little more,\nand the rabbits fell to following her, and she turned and took up one\nin her arms, and went straight on toward the children, but turning\nand talking to the rabbits now and again.\n\nAs to the babes, she saw the goats, of whom were now a dozen, or\nthereabouts, standing together in a kind of ring, and the little ones\ngoing from one to the other playing with them happily.  But presently\nthe lad turned and saw her coming with her tail of little beasts, and\nhe cried out a great Oh and ran toward her straightway, and the\nmaiden after him; and he held out his arms to have the rabbit she\nbore, and she gave it to him smiling, and said:  Lo now! here be\npretty playmates; but look to it that ye be soft and kind with them,\nfor they are but feeble people.  So the younglings fell to sporting\nwith their new friends, and for a little forgat both goats and golden\nlady; but the goats drew nigh, and stood about them bleating, nor\ndurst they run at the rabbits to butt them, because of Birdalone and\nthe little ones.\n\nThere then stood the slim maiden, tall and gleaming above her little\nflock; and her heart was full of mirth and rest, and the fear was all\nforgotten.  But as she looked up toward the grey walls, lo, new\ntidings to hand!  For she saw an old man with a long white beard\nslowly coming toward them:  she started not, but abode his coming\nquietly, and as he drew nigh she could see of him that he was big and\nstark, and, old as he was, not yet bowed with his many years.  He\nstood looking on this Queen and her court silently a while, and then\nhe spake:  Such a sight I looked not to see on this Isle of the Young\nand the Old.  She said:  But meseemeth it is full meet that these\nyounglings should sport with the creatures.  He smiled and said:\nSuch a voice I looked not to hear on the Isle of the Young and the\nOld.\n\nBirdalone became somewhat troubled, and said:  Am I welcome here? for\nif I be not, I will pray thy leave to depart.  He said:  Thou art as\nwelcome as the very spring, my child; and if thou have a mind to\nabide here, who shall naysay thee?  For surely thou art young; nay,\nin regard to me thou art scarce older than babes.  All blessings be\nwith thee.  But though thou art true and kind, as is clear to be seen\nby thy playing with these children and the landward beasts in peace\nand love, yet it may be so that thou hast brought hither somewhat\nless than peace.  And he smiled upon her strangely.\n\nShe looked somewhat scared at his last words, and said:  But how so?\nIf I might I would bear nought but peace and happiness to any place.\nThe old carle laughed outright now, and said:  How so, dear child?\nbecause ladies so sweet and lovesome as thou be sent by love, and\nlove rendeth apart that which was joined together.\n\nShe wondered at his word, and was bewildered by it, but she held her\npeace; and he said:  Now we may talk hereof later on; but the matter\nto hand now is the quenching of thine hunger; for I will not ask thee\nwhereby thou camest, since by water thou needs must have come.\nWherefore now I bid thee to our house, and these little ones shall go\nwith us, and the three of these horned folk whom we are wont to\ntether amidst the wrack and ruin of what once was fair; the rest have\nour leave to depart, and these nibblers also; for we have a potherb\ngarden by our house, and are fain to keep the increase of the same\nfor ourselves.  Birdalone laughed, and shook her skirts at the\nconeys, and they all scuttled away after the manner of their kind.\nThereat the little lad looked downcast and well-nigh tearful, but the\nmaid stamped her foot, and roared well-favouredly.\n\nBirdalone did her best to solace her, and plucked a bough from a\nhawthorn bush far above the little ones' reach whereon was yet some\nbelated blossom, and gave it to her and stilled her.  But the old man\npicked out his milch-goats from the flock (whereof was the white),\nand drave them before him, while the two babes went on still beside\nBirdalone, the little carle holding her hand and playing with the\nfingers thereof; the maiden sometimes hanging on to her gown,\nsometimes going loose and sporting about beside her.\n\nSo came they to where the ground became smoother, and there was a\nfair piece of greensward in a nook made by those great walls and\ntowers, which sheltered it from the north.  The said walls seemed to\nbe the remnant of what had once been a great house and castle; and up\naloft, where was now no stair to come at them, were chimneys and\nhearths here and there, and windows with fair seats in them, and\narched doors and carven pillars, and many things beautiful, but now\nwas all ruined and broken, and the house was roofless and floorless:\nwithal it was overgrown with ash-trees and quicken-beam, and other\nberry-trees and key-trees, which had many years ago seeded in the\nrent walls, and now grew there great and flourishing.  But in the\ninnermost nook of this mighty remnant, and using for its lowly walls\ntwo sides of the ancient ashlar ones, stood a cot builded not over\ntrimly of small wood, and now much overgrown with roses and woodbine.\nIn front of it was a piece of garden ground, wherein waxed potherbs,\nand a little deal of wheat; and therein was a goodly row of bee-\nskeps; and all without it was the pleasant greensward aforesaid,\nwherein stood three great ancient oaks, and divers thorns, which also\nwere ancient after their kind.\n\nThe elder led his guest into the cot, which had but simple plenishing\nof stools and benches, and a table unartful, and then went to tether\nhis goats in the ruined hall of the house, and the children must\nneeds with him, though Birdalone had been glad of one of them at\nleast; but there was no nay, but that they must go see their dear\nwhite goat in her stall.  Howsoever all three came back again\npresently, the old carle with a courteous word in his mouth, and he\ntook Birdalone's hand, and kissed it and bade her welcome to his\nhouse, as though he had been a great lord at home in his own castle.\nTherewith must the little ones also kiss her hand and be courteous;\nand Birdalone suffered it, laughing, and then caught them up in her\narms, and clipped and kissed them well-favouredly; wherewith belike\nthey were not over-well pleased, though the boy endured it kindly.\nThereafter the elder set forth his banquet, which was simple enough:\nupland cheer of cream and honey, and rough bread; but sweet it was to\nBirdalone to eat it with good welcome, and the courtesy of the old\nman.\n\nWhen they were done, they went out-a-doors, and Birdalone and the old\nman laid them down under an oak-tree, and the children sported about\nanigh them.  Then spake Birdalone:  Old man, thou hast been kind unto\nme; but now wouldest thou tell me about thee, what thou art, and what\nare these walls about us here?  Said he:  I doubt if I may do so,\nthis day at least.  But belike thou shalt abide with us, and then\nsome day the word may come into my mouth.  She held her peace, and\ninto her mind it came that it would be sweet to dwell there, and\nwatch those fair children waxing, and the lad growing up and loving\nher; yea, even she fell to telling up the years which would make him\na man, and tried to see herself, how she would look, when the years\nwere worn thereto.  Then she reddened at the untold thought, and\nlooked down and was silent.  But the elder looked on her anxiously,\nand said:  It will be no such hard life for thee, for I have still\nsome work in me, and thou mayst do something in spite of thy slender\nand delicate fashion.  She laughed merrily, and said:  Forsooth, good\nsire, I might do somewhat more than something; for I am deft in all\nsuch work as here ye need; so fear not but I should earn my\nlivelihood, and that with joy.  Merry days shall we have then, said\nhe.\n\nBut therewith her eye caught the gleam of her golden sleeve, and she\nthought of Aurea, and her heart smote her for her errand; then she\nlaid her hand on her girdle and called to mind little Viridis, and\nthe glitter of the ring on her finger brought the image of Atra\nbefore her; then she rose up and said:  Thou art kind, father, but I\nmay not; I have an errand; this day must I depart from thee.  He\nsaid:  Thou hast broken my heart; if I were not so old, I would weep.\nAnd he hung adown his head.\n\nShe stood before him abashed, as if she had done him a wrong.  At\nlast he looked up and said:  Must it be to-day?  Wilt thou not abide\nwith us night-long, and go thy ways in the early morning?\n\nNow she scarce knew how to gainsay him, so wretched as the old carle\nlooked; so it came to this, that she yeasaid the abiding till to-\nmorrow.  Then suddenly he became gay and merry, and he kissed her\nhand, and fell to much speaking, telling tales of little import\nconcerning his earlier days.  But when she asked him again of how he\ncame there, and what meant the great ruined house, then he became\nfoolish and wandering, and might scarce answer her; whereas otherwise\nhe was a well-spoken old carle of many words, and those of the\ngrandest.\n\nThen changed his mood again, and he fell to bewailing her departure,\nand how that henceforth he should have none to speak to him with\nunderstanding.  Then she smiled on him and said:  But yonder babes\nwill grow up; month by month they will be better fellows unto thee.\nFair child, he said, thou dost not know.  My days to come are but\nfew, so that I should see but little of their waxing in any case.\nBut furthermore, wax they will not; such as they be now, such shall\nthey be till I at least see the last of them and the earth.\n\nBirdalone wondered at this word, and the place seemed changed to her,\nyea, was grown somewhat dreary; but she said to the carle:  And thou,\ndost thou change in any wise, since these change not?  He laughed\nsomewhat grimly, and said:  The old that be here change from old to\ndead; how could I change to better?  Yea, the first thing I had to do\nhere was to bury an old man.  Quoth she:  And were there any children\nhere then?  Yea, said he; these same, or I can see no difference in\nthem.  Said Birdalone:  And how long ago is that?  And how camest\nthou hither?  His face became foolish, and he gibbered rather than\nspake:  No, I wot not; no, no, no, not a whit, a whit.  But presently\nafter was he himself again, and telling her a tale of a great lady of\nthe earl-folk, a baron's dame, and how dear he was unto her.  He lay\nyet on the grass, and she stood before him, and presently he put\nforth a hand to her gown-hem and drew her to him thereby, and fell to\ncaressing her feet; and Birdalone was ashamed thereat, and a little\nangry.  He was nought abashed, but sat up and said:  Well, since thou\nmust needs depart to-morrow, be we merry to-day.  And I pray thee\ntalk much with me, fair child, for sweet and sweet is thy voice to\nhearken.  Then he arose and said:  Now will I fetch thee somewhat to\neke the joy of us both.  And he turned therewith and went into the\nhouse.\n\nBirdalone stood there, and was now perplexed and downhearted; for now\nthe look of the elder scarce liked her, and the children began to\nseem to her as images, or at the best not more to her than the\nrabbits or the goats; and she rued her word that she would abide\nthere the night through.  For she said to herself:  I fear some trap\nor guile; is the witch behind this also? for the old man is yet\nstark, and though he be foolish at whiles, yet may wizardry have\nlearned him some guile.\n\nWith that cometh out the carle again, bearing a little keg and a\nmazer roughly wrought; and he came to Birdalone, and sat down, and\nbade her sit by him, and said to her:  Maybe I shall hear more of thy\nsweet voice when thy sweet lips have been in the cup.  Therewith he\npoured forth into the mazer, and handed it to Birdalone, and lo! it\nwas clear and good mead.  She sipped thereof daintily, and, to say\nsooth, was well-pleased therewith, and it stirred the heart in her.\nBut then she gave back the cup to the elder, and would no more of it.\nAs for him, he drank what was left in the cup, looking over the rim\nthereof meanwhile; and then filled himself another, and another, and\nyet more.  But whereas it might have been looked for that his tongue\nshould be loosened by the good mead into foolishness and gibbering,\nhe became rather few-spoken, and more courteous and stately even than\nhe had been at the first.  But in the end, forsooth, he was\nforgetting Birdalone, what she was, and he fell a-talking, always\nwith much pomp and state, as if to barons and earls, and great\nladies; till suddenly his head fell back, he turned over on his face,\nand all wit was gone from him.\n\nAt first, then, Birdalone was afraid that he was dead, or nigh unto\ndeath, and she knelt down and raised his head, and fetched water and\ncast it over his face.  But when she saw that he was breathing not so\nill, and that the colour was little changed in his lips and cheeks,\nshe knew that it was but the might of the mead that had overcome him.\nWherefore she laid him so that he was easy, and then stood up and\nlooked about her, and saw the children playing together a little way\noff; and nought else anigh her, save the birds in the brake, or\nflying on their errands eagerly from place to place.  Then, as it\nwere, without her will being told them, her limbs and her feet turned\nher about to the shore where lay the Sending Boat, and she went\nspeedily but quietly thitherward, her heart beating quick, for fear\nlest something should yet stay her, and her eyes glancing from brake\nto bush, as if she looked to see some enemy, old or new, come out\nthence.\n\nSo now her will was clear enough to her feet, and they brought her\ndown to the water-side and the long strand, past which the wide water\nlay windless and gleaming in the hot afternoon.  Then lightly she\nstepped aboard, and awoke the Sending Boat with blood-offering, and\nit obeyed her, and sped swiftly on the way to the southward.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.  BIRDALONE COMES TO THE ISLE OF THE QUEENS\n\n\n\nBirdalone awoke the next morning while the boat was yet speeding over\nthe water, and the sun was up:  but she was hard on the land, which\nsat low and green, like a meadow exceeding fair, on the bosom of the\nwater, and many goodly trees were sprinkled about the greenland.  But\nfrom amidst the trees, no great way from the water's edge, rose a\ngreat house, white and fair, as if it were new-builded, and all\nglorious with pinnacles, and tabernacles set with imagery.\n\nPresently the boat's bows ran into the reed and rush at the brim of\nthe water, and Birdalone stepped ashore without more ado, and the\nscent of the meadow-sweet amongst which she landed brought back unto\nher the image of Green Eyot that while agone.\n\nBut now when she was ashore the dread took hold of her again, and her\nknees trembled under her, so that she might scarce stand, so fearful\nwas she of walking into some trap; especially when she beheld that\ngoodly house, lest therein awaited her some proud and cruel lady, and\nno kind damsels to deliver her.\n\nShe looked about her, and saw in all the fair meadow neither man nor\nwoman, nor draught-beast nor milch-beast, nought but the little\ncreatures of the brake and the bent-grass, which were but as the\nblossoms thereof; and the birds running in the herbage or singing\namidst the tree-boughs.\n\nThen she thought that she must needs go forward, or belike her errand\nwould not speed; that the Sending Boat might not obey her, unless she\nsaw through the adventure to the end; so she went on toward the house\nquaking.\n\nSoon was she at the porch of the white palace, and had seen no man\nnor heard any voice of men; much she marvelled, despite her dread, at\nthe beauty of the said house, and the newness thereof; for it was as\none flower arisen out of the earth, and every part of it made the\nbeauty of the other parts more excellent; and so new it was, that it\nwould have seemed as if the masons thereof had but struck their\nscaffold yesterday, save that under the very feet of the walls the\nsweet garden flowers grew all uncrushed.\n\nNow comes Birdalone through the porch unto the screens of the great\nhall; and she stopped a little to recover her breath, that she might\nbe the quieter and calmer amongst the great folk and mighty whom she\nlooked to find therein.  So she gathered heart; but one thing daunted\nher, to wit, that she heard no sound come from that great and goodly\nhall, so that she doubted if it were perchance left desert by them\nwho had been its lords.\n\nShe raised her hand to the door of the screen, and it opened easily\nbefore her, and she entered, and there indeed she saw new tidings.\nFor the boards end-long and over-thwart were set, and thereat were\nsitting a many folk, and their hands were reached out to knife and to\ndish, and to platter and cup; but such a hush there was within, that\nthe song of the garden birds without sounded to her as loud as they\nwere the voices of the children of Adam.\n\nNext she saw that all that company, from the great folk on the dais\ndown to those who stood about the hall to do the service, were women,\none and all; not one carle might she see from where she stood:\nlovely were they many of them, and none less than comely; their\ncheeks were bright, and their eyes gleamed, and their hair flowed\ndown fair of fashion.  And she stood, and durst not move a long\nwhile, but expected when someone would speak a word, and all should\nturn their heads toward the new-comer.  But none moved nor spake.\nAnd the fear increased in her amidst that hush, and weighed so heavy\non her heart, that at last she might endure it no longer, but fell\nswooning to the floor.\n\nWhen she came to herself; and the swoon-dreams had left her, she saw\nby the changing of the sun through the hall-windows, that she had\nlain there long, more nearly two hours than one; and at first she\ncovered her face with her hands as she crouched there, that she might\nnot see the sight of the silent hall, for yet was it as hushed as\nbefore.  Then slowly she arose, and the sound of her raiment and her\nstirring feet was loud in her ears.  But when she was upright on her\nfeet, she hardened her heart, and went forth into the hall, and no\nless was her wonder than erst.  For when she came close to those\nladies as they sat at table, and her raiment brushed the raiment of\nthe serving-women as she passed by, then saw she how no breath came\nfrom any of these, and that they neither spake nor moved, because\nthey were dead.\n\nAt first, then, she thought to flee away at once, but again she had\nmind of her errand, and so went up the hall, and so forth on to the\ndais; and there again, close by the high table, she saw new tidings.\nFor there was set a bier, covered with gold and pall, and on it was\nlaid a tall man, a king, belted and crowned; and beside the said\nbier, by the head of the king, knelt a queen of exceeding goodly\nbody, clad all in raiment of pearl and bawdekin; and her hands were\nclasped together, and her mouth was drawn, and her brow knit with the\nanguish of her grief.  But athwart the king's breast lay a naked\nsword all bloody; and this Birdalone noted, that whereas the lady was\nof skin and hue as if she were alive, the king was yellow as wax, and\nhis cheeks were shrunken, and his eyes had been closed by the wakers\nof the dead.\n\nLong Birdalone looked and wondered; and now if her fear were less,\nher sorrow was more for all that folk sitting there dead in their\nancient state and pomp.  And was not the thought clean out of her\nhead, that yet they might awake and challenge her, and that she might\nbe made one of that silent company.  Withal she felt her head\nbeginning to fail her, and she feared that she might swoon again and\nnever waken more, but lie for ever beside that image of the dead\nking.\n\nSo then she refrained her both of fear and sorrow, and walked\nspeedily down the hall, looking neither to the right nor left:  and\nshe came forth into the pleasance, but stayed there nought, so nigh\nit seemed to that hushed company.  Thence came she forth into the\nopen meadow, and sweet and dear seemed its hot sunshine and noisy\nbirds and rustling leaves.  Nevertheless, so great was the tumult of\nher spirits, that once more she grew faint, and felt that she might\nscarce go further.  So she dragged herself into the shade of a thorn-\ntree, and let her body sink unto the ground, and lay there long\nunwitting.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.  AND NOW SHE COMES TO THE ISLE OF THE KINGS\n\n\n\nWhen Birdalone came to herself it was drawing toward the glooming,\nand she rose up hastily, and went down to the Sending Boat, for she\nwould not for aught abide the night in that fearful isle, lest the\nflock of the hall should come alive and walk in the dusk and the\ndark.  She stepped aboard lightly, and yielded her blood to the pride\nof that ferry, and it awoke and bore her forth, and she went through\nthe night till she fell asleep.\n\nWhen she awoke it was broad day and the sun just arising, and lo!\nbefore her, some half mile off, an isle rugged and rocky, and going\nup steep from the shore; and then, held as it were by the fangs of\nthe rocks and pikes of the higher land, was a castle, white, high,\nand hugely builded, though, because of the rock-land belike, it\nspread not much abroad.  Like to the lovely house of yesterday, it\nseemed new-builded; and, little as Birdalone knew of such matters,\nher heart told her that this new house was fashioned for battle.\n\nShe was downcast when she saw the isle so rugged and forbidding, but\nwhen the boat came aland in a stony bight, whence the ground went up\nsomewhat steeply toward the heights, she went ashore straightway, and\ntoiled up toward the white battlement.  Presently she found herself\nin a strait and rugged path betwixt two walls of rock, so that she\nlost sight of the castle a while, till she came out on to a level\nplace which looked down from aloft on to the blue water, but all over\nagainst her close at hand were the great towers and walls.  She was\nworn by the rough road, and over helpless she felt her, and all too\nlittle to deal with that huge morsel of the world; and her valiancy\ngave way, and her trust in her errand.  She sat down on a stone and\nwept abundantly.\n\nAfter a while she was amended, and she looked up and saw the huge\nhold, and said:  Yea, but if it were less by the half than it is, it\nwould still be big enough to cow me.  Yet she stood not up.  Then she\nput forth a foot of her, and said aloud:  Sorely hath this rough road\ntried Atra's shoon and their goodly window-work; if they are to be\nknown I must be speedy on my journey or go barefoot.\n\nAs she spoke she stood up, and the sound of her own voice frighted\nher, though nought noiseless was the place; for the wind was there,\nand beat to and fro the castle and the rock, and ran baffled into\nevery corner of that market-place of nothing.  For in that garth was\nneither knight nor squire nor sergeant; no spear-head glittered from\nthe wall, no gleam of helm showed from the war-swales; no porter was\nat the gate; the drawbridge over the deep ghyll was down, the\nportcullis was up, and the great door cast wide open.\n\nBirdalone steeled her heart and went forward swiftly, and over the\nbridge, and entered the basecourt, and came without more ado to the\ndoor of the great hall, and opened it easily, as with the door of\nyesterday, looking to find another show like unto that one; and even\nso it fell out.\n\nForsooth the hall was nought light and lovely, and gay with gold and\nbright colours, as that other, but beset with huge round pillars that\nbore aloft a wide vault of stone, and of stone were the tables; and\nthe hallings that hung on the wall were terrible pictures of battle\nand death, and the fall of cities, and towers a-tumbling and houses\na-flaming.\n\nNone the less there also were the shapes of folk that moved not nor\nspake, though not so thronged was that hall as the other one; and it\nseemed as if men were sitting there at a council rather than a feast.\nClose by Birdalone's right hand as she entered were standing in a row\nalong the screen big men-at-arms all weaponed, and their faces hidden\nby their sallets; and down below the dais on either side of the high\ntable was again a throng of all-armed men; and at the high-table\nitself; and looking down the hall, sat three crowned kings, each with\nhis drawn sword lying across his knees, and three long-hoary wise men\nstood before them at the nether side of the board.\n\nBirdalone looked on it all, striving with her fear:  but yet more\nthere was, for she deemed that needs must she go through the hall up\nto the dais, lest the Sending Boat deny its obedience.  Up toward the\ndais she went then, passing by weaponed men who sat as if abiding the\ncouncil's end at the end-long tables.  And now, though no shape of\nman there spake or breathed, yet sound lacked not; for within the\nhall went the wind as without, and beat about from wall to wall, and\ndrave clang and clash from the weapons hung up, and waved the arras,\nand fared moaning in the nooks, and hummed in the vault above.\n\nCame she up to the dais then, and stood beside one of the wise men,\nand looked on the kings, and saw the mightiness which had been in\nthem, and quaked before them.  Then she turned from them and looked\ndown to the floor, and lo! there, just below the dais, lay a woman on\na golden bier; exceeding fair had she been, with long yellow hair\nstreaming down from her head; but now waxen white she was, with ashen\nlips and sunken cheeks.  Clad was she in raiment of purple and pall,\nbut the bosom of her was bared on one side, and therein was the road\nwhereby the steel had fared which had been her bane.\n\nNow when Birdalone had gazed thereon a while, she deemed that if she\ntarried there long amidst those fierce men by the dead woman, she\nshould lose her wit full soon, so sore the fear, held back, beset her\nnow.  Wherefore she turned and went hastily down the hall, and out-a-\ndoors, and over the bridge, and ran fleet-foot down the rocky way\nwhereby she had come, till she could run no further, and lay down\nunder a great stone breathless and fordone; yet her heart upheld her\nand suffered her not to swoon, belike because she had given her limbs\nsuch hard work to do.\n\nThere she lay awake and troubled for an hour or more, and then she\nfell asleep, and slept till the day was worn toward sunset, and\nnought meddled with her.  She arose and went to her ship somewhat\ndownhearted, wondering how many such terrors should befall her; nay,\nwhether the Sending Boat would so lead her that henceforth she should\nhappen on no children of Adam but such as were dead images of the\nliving.  Had all the world died since she left the Isle of the Young\nand the Old?\n\nHowsoever, she had nought to do save to board her ferry, and content\nits greedy soul with her blood, and drive it with the spell-words.\nAnd thereafter, when it was speeding on, and the twilight dusking\napace, she looked aback, and seemed to see the far-off woodland in\nthe northern ort, and the oak-clad ridge, where she had met her wood-\nmother; and then it was as if Habundia were saying to her:  Meet\nagain we shall.  And therewith straightway became life sweeter unto\nher.\n\nDeepened then the dusk, and became night, and she floated on through\nit, and was asleep alone on the bosom of the water.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.  OF BIRDALONE, HOW SHE CAME UNTO THE ISLE OF NOTHING\n\n\n\nLong before sunrise, in the very morn-dusk, she awoke and found that\nher ferry had taken land again.  Little might she see what the said\nland was like; so she sat patiently and abode the day in the boat;\nbut when day was come, little more was to see than erst.  For flat\nwas the isle, and scarce raised above the wash of the leeward ripple\non a fair day; nor was it either timbered or bushed or grassed, and,\nso far as Birdalone might see, no one foot of it differed in aught\nfrom another.  Natheless she deemed that she was bound to go ashore\nand seek out the adventure, or spoil her errand else.\n\nOut of the boat she stepped then, and found the earth all paved of a\nmiddling gravel, and nought at all growing there, not even the\nsmallest of herbs; and she stooped down and searched the gravel, and\nfound neither worm nor beetle therein, nay nor any one of the sharp\nand slimy creatures which are wont in such ground.\n\nA little further she went, and yet a little further, and no change\nthere was in the land; and yet she went on and found nothing; and she\nwended her ways southward by the sun, and the day was windless.\n\nAt last she had gone a long way and had no sight of water south of\nthe isle, nor had she seen any hill, nay, not so much as an ant-heap,\nwhence she might look further around; and it seemed to her that she\nmight go on for ever, and reach the heart of Nowhither at last.\nWherefore she thought she would turn back and depart this ugly isle,\nand that no other adventure abided her therein.  And by now it was\nhigh noon; and she turned about and took a few steps on the backward\nroad.\n\nBut even therewith it seemed as if the sun, which heretofore had been\nshining brightly in the heavens, went out as a burnt-down candle, and\nall was become dull grey over head, as all under foot was a dull dun.\nBut Birdalone deemed she could follow a straight course back again,\nand so walked on sturdily.  Hour after hour she went and stayed not,\nbut saw before her no glimpse of the northern shore, and no change in\nthe aspect of the ground about her.\n\nIt had so happened that a little before she had turned to go back,\nshe had eaten her dinner of a piece of bread and a morsel of cheese,\nand now as she stooped and peered on the ground, looking for some\nsign of the way, as her foot-prints going south, and had her eyes low\nanigh the earth, she saw something white at her feet in the gathering\ndusk (for the day was wearing), and she put her hand to it and lifted\nit, and found it a crumb of bread, and knew that it must have come\nfrom her dinner of' seven hours ago, whereas till that time her bread\nhad lain unbroken in her scrip.  Fear and anguish smote her\ntherewith, for she saw that in that dull land, every piece whereof\nwas like every other piece, she must have gone about in a ring, and\ncome back again to where she first turned to make for the northern\nshore.\n\nYet would she not cast aside all hope, but clad herself in her\nvaliancy.  Forsooth she knew it availed nought to try to move on in\nthe twilight; so she laid herself down on that waste, and made up her\nmind to sleep if she might, and abide the new day there, and then to\nstrive with the way once more, for belike, she thought, it may be\nfair to-morrow, and the sun shining.  And as she was very weary with\ntramping the waste all day, she fell asleep at once, and slept the\nshort night through.\n\nBut when she awoke, and saw what the new day was, her heart fell\nindeed, for now was she encompassed and shut in with a thick dark\nmist (though it seemed to be broad day), so that had there been aught\nto see she would not have seen it her own length away from her.  So\nthere she stood, hanging her head, and striving to think; but the\nmaster-thought of death drawing nigh scattered all other thoughts, or\nmade them dim and feeble.\n\nLong she stood there; but suddenly something came into her mind.  She\nset her hand to the fair-broidered pouch which hung from Viridis'\nloin-girdle, and drew out thence flint and steel and tinder, which\nmatters, forsooth, had served her before in the boat to make fire\nwithal.  Then she set her hand to her head, and drew forth the tress\nof hair which Habundia had given her, and which was coiled up in the\ncrown of her own abundant locks which decked her so gloriously; she\ndrew two hairs from the said tress, and held them between her lips\nwhile she did up the tress in its place again, and then, pale and\ntrembling, fell to striking a light, and when she had the tinder\nburning, she cried out:\n\nO wood-mother, wood-mother!  How then may we meet again as thou didst\npromise me, if I die here in this empty waste?  O wood-mother, if\nthou mightest but come hither for my deliverance!\n\nThen she burned the hairs one after another, and stood waiting, but\nnought befell a great while, and her heart sickened, and there she\nstood like a stone.\n\nBut in awhile, lo! there came as it were a shadow amidst the mist, or\nrather lying thereon, faint and colourless, and it was of the shape\nof the wood-mother, with girt-up gown and bow in hand.  Birdalone\ncried aloud with joy, and hastened toward the semblance, but came to\nit no nigher, and still she went, and the semblance still escaped\nher, and she followed on and on; and this lasted long, and faster and\nfaster must she follow lest it vanish, and she gathered her skirts\ninto her girdle, and fell to running fleet-foot after the fleeing\nshadow, which she loved dearly even amidst the jaws of death; and all\nher fleetness of foot had Birdalone to put forth in following up the\nchase; but even to die in the pain would she not miss that dear\nshadow.\n\nBut suddenly, as she ran, the mist was all gone from before her, the\nsun shone hot and cloudless; there was no shadow or shape of Habundia\nthere, nought but the blue lake and the ugly lip of that hideous\ndesert, with the Sending Boat lying a half score yards from her feet;\nand behind her stood up, as it were a wall, the mist from out of\nwhich she had come.\n\nForsooth Birdalone was too breathless to cry out her joy, but her\nheart went nigh to breaking therewith, and lovely indeed to her was\nthe rippled water and the blue sky; and she knew that her wood-mother\nhad sped a sending to her help, and she fell a-weeping where she\nstood, for love of her wise mother, and for longing to behold her:\nshe stretched out her arms to the north quarter, and said blessings\non her in a voice faint for weariness.  Then she laid her down on the\ndesert, and rested her with sleep, despite the hot sun, and when she\nawoke, some three hours thereafter, all was as before, save that the\nsky had now some light-flying clouds, and still was the wall of mist\nbehind her.  Wherefore she deemed she had yet time, and the blue\nrippling water wooed her much-besweated limbs; so she did off her\nraiment and took the water, and became happy and unweary therein.\nThen she landed and stood in the sun to dry her, and so, strengthened\nwith that refreshing, clad her, and went aboard and did the due\nrites, and sped over the waters, and had soon lost sight of that ugly\nblotch on the fair face of the Great Water.\n\n\nHere ends the Second Part of the Water of the Wondrous Isles, which\nis called Of the Wondrous Isles, and begins the Third Part of the\nsaid tale, which is called Of the Castle of the Quest.\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIRD PART:  OF THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.  BIRDALONE COMES TO THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nEmpty was the day to Birdalone save for her thoughts, and she slept\nnot a good while of the night.  When she awoke in the morning there\nwas no land before her, and she began to fear somewhat that so it\nmight be many days, and that she might have to fare the water\nlandless, and perchance till she starved for hunger; for now was\nthere but little victual left of that which the kind Viridis had\ngiven her.  So she wore the day somewhat uneasily, and by then night\nfell had eaten but little; yet was that little the last crumb and\ngobbet of her store.  Wherefore it is no wonder though she were\ndismayed when she awoke early on the morrow, and beheld nought before\nher save the landless water.\n\nBut about noon she deemed she saw a little cloud in the offing that\nmoved not as the other clouds, and she watched it closely at first,\nand it changed not any the more, and she grew weary of watching it\nand strove to sleep, turning her head to the after part of her ferry;\nand thus betwixt sleeping and waking she wore away three hours:  then\nshe stood up and looked ahead, and lo, the white cloud had taken\nshape, and was a white castle far away (for the day was exceeding\nclear), sitting, as it seemed, on the very face of the water.  The\nboat sped on swiftly thitherward, so that it was not right long ere\nBirdalone beheld the green shore on either side of the said castle,\nand at last, three hours before sunset, she was drawing nigh thereto,\nand beheld it all clearly, what it was.\n\nIt was brand-new, and was fair enough, builded part of stone and\nlime, part of framed work, but was but middling big.  As she drew\nnigher yet, she saw that there were folk on the walls of it, and they\nseemed to see her, for a horn was winded from the battlement, and\nfolk were running together to somewhither.  And now was Birdalone\ncome so near, that she saw the water-gate of the castle, and folk\ncoming out thereby on to the landing-place; and she saw presently,\nthat a very tall man with grizzled hair stood foremost of them, and\nhe waved his hand to her, and spake something, but the wind bore the\nwords away from her; yet she seemed to know that this folk would do\nher to wit that they would have none of her; and her heart died\nwithin her, so faint and hungry as she was.\n\nHowsoever the ferry sped on its way swiftly, and in a minute or two\nhad stayed itself at the landing-stair, whereabout were gathered a\nscore of men, some armed some unarmed, and they seemed for the more\npart to be grey-headed and past middle-age.\n\nBirdalone stood up in her craft, and the aforesaid tall grey man, who\nwas unarmed, but clad in knightly raiment, stood on the stair and\nspake unto her, and said:  Lady, this is an house where women enter\nnever since first the roof was done thereon, which forsooth was but a\nyear ago.  We will pray thee therefore to turn thy boat's head away,\nand seek some other lodging by the water, either eastward or\nwestward.\n\nLittle knew Birdalone of worldly courtesy, or she had made him a\nsharp answer belike; but she only looked on him ruefully, and said:\nGood warrior, I am come a long way, and may not turn back from mine\nerrand; and I am now lacking victual and hungry, and if ye help me\nnot, it is like that I shall die.  Much lieth on mine errand, if ye\nknew it.  She was weeping-ripe, but refrained her tears, though her\nlip quivered.  She stretched out her hands to the greybeard, and he\nlooked on her and found her exceeding fair; and he deemed her to be\nguileless, both because of her simple speech and sweet voice, and the\ngoodliness of her face and eyes.  But he said:  Lady, thine errand\nhath nought to do with it, it is thy womanhood that bars our door.\nFor all we are bound by oath not to suffer a woman to abide in this\ncastle till our lords take the bann off, and bid us open to women.\nShe smiled faintly, and said:  If I might but see thy lords then,\nsince thou art not master here.  He said:  They are away, and will\nnot be back till to-morrow morning; and I wot not the hour of their\nreturn.  And yet, said he, I would we might help thee somewhat.  O I\npray thee, I pray thee! she said, or mine errand will come to nought\nafter all.\n\nTherewith came another man down the stair, and stood by the old\nknight and plucked his sleeve, and fell to talk with him softly.\nThis man was by his habit a religious, and was a younger man than the\nothers, it might be of five and thirty winters, and he was fair of\nfavour.  While they spake together Birdalone sat her down again, and\nwas well-nigh spent.\n\nAt last the old man spake:  Damsel, he said, we deem we may suffer\nthee to enter the castle since thy need is so great, and have a\nmeal's meat at our hands, and yet save our oath, if thou depart\nthence by the landward gate before sunset.  Will this serve thee?\nFair sir, said Birdalone, it will save my life and mine errand; I may\nsay no more words for my faintness, else would I thank thee.\n\nShe stood up on her feet, and the old man-at-arms reached out his\nhand to her, and she took it and came her ways up the stair, but\nfound herself but feeble.  But the priest (forsooth he was chaplain\nof the castle) helped her on the other side.  But when she stood on\nthe level stones by the water-gate, she turned to the old man and\nsaid:  One thing I will ask of thee, Is this place one of the\nWondrous Isles?  The elder shook his head.  We know not the Wondrous\nIsles, said he; this castle is builded on the mainland.  Her face\nflushed for joy at the word, and she said:  One thing I will crave of\nthee, to wit, that thou wilt leave my barge lying here untouched till\nthy masters come back, and wilt give command that none meddle\ntherewith.\n\nHe would have answered, but the priest brake in, and said:  This will\nhe do, lady, and he is the castellan, and moreover he will swear to\nobey thee herein.  And therewith he drew forth a cross with God\nnailed thereon, and the castellan swore on it with a good will.\n\nThen the priest drew Birdalone on, and between them they brought her\ninto the great hall, and set her down in a chair and propped her with\ncushions.  And when she was thus at rest, she began to weep somewhat,\nand the castellan and the priest stood by and comforted her; for\nthemseemed, despite her grief, that she had brought the sun into\ntheir house.\n\nNext were victual brought unto her of broth and venison, and good\nwine and cates and strawberries; and she was not so famished but she\nmight eat and drink with a good will.  But when she was done, and had\nrested a little, the castellan stood up and said:  Lady, the sun is\ngone off the western windows now, and I must save mine oath; but ere\nthou depart, I were fain to hear thy voice giving me pardon for my\nevil cheer and the thrusting of thee forth.  And therewith he put one\nknee to the ground, and took her hand and kissed it.  But Birdalone\nwas grown merry again, and she laughed and said:  What pardon thou\ncanst have of me, kind knight, thou hast; but now methinks thou\nmakest overmuch of me, because I am the only woman who hath come into\nthy castle.  I am but a simple maiden, though mine errand be not\nlittle.\n\nForsooth she wondered that the stark and gruff old man was so changed\nto her in little space; for nought she knew as yet how the sight of\nher cast a hot gleed of love into the hearts of them who beheld her.\n\nNow Birdalone arose; but the castellan knelt at her feet, and kissed\nher hand again, and again, and yet again.  Then he said:  Thou art\ngracious indeed.  But methinks the father here will lead thee out-a-\ngates; for he may show thee a lair, wherein thou shalt be safe enough\nto-night; and to-morrow may bring new tidings.\n\nSo the priest made obeisance to her and led her down the hall, and\nthe castellan's eyes were following them till the screen hid them.\nThe priest left her in the hall-porch a while, and went into the\nbuttery, and came back with a basket of meat and drink, and they went\nforth at the great gate together, and there was the last of the sun\nbefore them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  OF BIRDALONE, AND HOW SHE RESTED THE NIGHT THROUGH IN A\nBOWER WITHOUT THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nOn a fair smooth road went they amidst of a goodly meadow-land,\nwherein were little copses here and there.  When they were fairly out\nof the gate, the priest reached for Birdalone's hand, and she let him\ntake it and lead her along thereby, thinking no evil; but he might\nscarce speak for a while, so great was the stir in his heart at the\ntouch of her bare flesh.  But Birdalone spake and said:  Thou art\nkind, father, to lead me on my way thus.\n\nHe answered in a husky voice with his eyes cast down, and forsooth\nset on the feet of her:  It is not far that I am leading thee; there\nis a broken cot by the copse at the turn of the road yonder, where\nthou mayst abide to-night; it is better lodging than none, evil as it\nis for such an one as thou.  Birdalone laughed:  Worse have I had,\nsaid she, than would be the copse without the cot.  And she thought\nwithal of the prison in the Isle of Increase Unsought.\n\nHer voice seemed so cheery and friendly to the priest, that he shook\noff somewhat the moodiness of his desire, and looked up and said:  I\nshall tell thee, lady, that I suppose thou hast more errand with my\nlords than to crave lodging of them despite the custom of the castle.\nNay, I have an inkling of what thine errand may be, whereof more\nanon; but now shall I tell thee what is best for thee to do so as to\nhave speech of them the soonest.  They have gone forth with some of\nour lads to gather venison, or it may be beeves and muttons for our\nvictualling, and somewhat of battle may they have had on the way, for\nill neighbours have we.  But if they come back unfoughten they will\nbe wending this road, and must needs pass by thy copse-side; and if\nthou be sleeping the noise of them will full surely awaken thee.\nThen all thou hast to do is to come forth and stand in the way before\nthem, that they may see thee; and when once they have seen thee, how\nmay they pass thee by unspoken with?\n\nI thank thee heartily for thy rede, said Birdalone; but I would ask\nthee two things:  first, what is the name of the castle behind us?\nand second, why have ye the custom of shutting the door upon women?\nSaid the priest:  The castle is called in this country-side, the\nWhite Ward by the Water; but within there we call it the Castle of\nthe Quest; and thus is it called because my lords are seeking their\nloves whom they have lost; and they have sworn an oath that no woman\nshall enter therein till their own loves have trodden its floors.\n\nRose the heart of Birdalone at that word, and she deemed indeed that\nshe was come thither whereas her she-friends would have had her.  The\npriest beheld her and saw how her beauty was eked by that gladness,\nand he scarce knew how to contain himself; and might speak no word\nawhile; then he said:  Hearken further concerning thy matter; if my\nlords be tarried, and come not by matin-song, then I doubt not but\nthe castellan will send folk to see to thee.  He looked down\ntherewith and said:  I will come to thee myself; and will bring thee\nmen-at-arms, if need be.  But sometime to-morrow morning my lords\nwill come, save mischief hath betid, which God forbid.  And he\ncrossed himself; then he looked up and full in her face, and said:\nBut keep thine heart up; for whatsoever may betide, thou shalt not be\nleft uncared for.\n\nSaid Birdalone:  I see of thee that thou art become my good friend,\nand it rejoiceth my heart; I shall be well at ease to-night in thy\ncot, and to-morrow morn I shall be valiant to do thy bidding.\n\nThe sweetness of her speech so overcame him, that he but looked\nconfusedly on her, as if he scarce heard her; and they went on\ntogether without more words, till he said:  Here are we at the cot,\nand I will show thee thy chamber.  So he led her to a little thatched\nbower, built with walls of wattle-work daubed with clay, which stood\nwithout the remnant of the cot:  it was clean and dry, for the roof\nwas weather-tight; but there was nought in it at all save a heap of\nbracken in a corner.\n\nThere stood the priest, still holding Birdalone's hand, and spake\nnot, but looked about, yet always covertly on Birdalone; but in a\nwhile he let go her hand, and seemed to wake up, and said:  This it\nis; a sorry place enough, were it even for a gangrel body.  Even so\nam I, quoth she laughing; and thou mayest look to it, that herein I\nshall rest full happily.  Then he gave her a horn, drawing it from\nout of the basket of victual, which he now set down on the ground;\nand he said:  If thou shouldst deem thee hard bestead, then wind this\nhorn, and we shall know its voice up there and come to help thee.\nNow I give thee good-night.\n\nShe thanked him sweetly, and he went slowly out of the bower, but was\nscarce gone ere he came back again, and said:  One thing I may\nperchance tell thee without drawing thine anger on my head; to wit,\nthat I it was who said to the castellan that he should take thee in.\nWilt thou say aught to this?  She said:  I will thank thee again and\nagain; for it was the saving of my life and mine errand.  And clearer\nis it now than ever that thou art a good friend unto me.\n\nAs she looked on him and caressed him with kind eyes, she saw that\nhis brow was knit, and his face troubled, and she said to him:  What\nails thee? art thou wroth with me in any wise?  O no, said he; how\nshould I be wroth with thee!  But there is a thing I would ask of\nthee.  Yea, and what? said she.  He said:  Nay, I may not, I may not.\nIt shall be for to-morrow, or another day.  He spake it looking down,\nand in a broken voice; and she wondered somewhat at him, but not\nmuch, deeming that he was troubled by something which had nought to\ndo with her, and which he might refrain from thinking of, even before\na stranger.\n\nBut presently he caught her hand and kissed it, and bade her good-\nnight again, and then went hastily out of the bower; and when he was\nwell without, he muttered, but not so as she might hear him:  Durst I\nhave asked her, she would have suffered me to kiss her cheek.  Alas!\nfool that I was!  Birdalone turned then to her bracken bed, and found\nit sweet and clean; and she was at rest and peace in her mind, albeit\nher body was exceeding weary.  She felt happy in the little lonely\ncot, and her heart had gone out to the sweet meadow-land, and she\nloved it after all the trouble of the water; and herseemed that even\nnow, in the dusk a-growing into dark, it loved and caressed her.  So\nshe laid her down, nor unclad herself at all, lest she should have to\narise on a sudden, and show those tokens of the three damsels on her\nbody.\n\nA little while she lay there happily, hearkening the voices of the\nnightingales in the brake, and then she fell into a dreamless sleep,\nunbroken till the short night passed into day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  HOW BIRDALONE DIGHT HER FOR MEETING THE CHAMPIONS OF\nTHE QUEST\n\n\n\nIt was the birds beginning their first song once more that awakened\nBirdalone before the sun was up; but she had no will to stir a while,\nwhereas she felt so happy and restful; and that all the more when she\nremembered where she was, and told herself that her errand was now\nlike to be accomplished; and she thought of her friends whom she had\nleft on the Isle of Increase Unsought, and blessed them for their\nkindness, and the love of them was sweet to her heart, and amidst\nsuch thoughts she fell asleep again.\n\nWhen she awoke thereafter there was a flood of sunshine lying on the\nmeadows, and she sprang up in haste lest she had overslept herself,\nbut when she was come out of the bower, she soon saw that the\nsunbeams lay low on the land, and that it was yet the first hour of\nthe sun; so she turned about, and went through the copse to the other\nside, and lo! a little clear stream running before her.  So she spake\nto herself softly and said:  Fie on it!  I was weary with the boat\nand my hunger last night, and I went to bed unwashen; and this morn I\nam weary for the foulness of my unwashen body.  Unseemly it were to\nme to show myself sluttish before these lords; let me find time for a\nbath at least.\n\nTherewith she went swiftly down to the water, undoing her girdle and\nlaces by the way.  She came to the stream and found it running\nbetween blue-flowering mouse-ear and rushes, into a pool which\ndeepened from a sandy shallow:  so anon her borrowed raiment was\nlying on the grassy lip of the water, and she was swimming and\ndisporting her in the pool, with her hair loose and wavering over her\nwhite back like some tress of the water-weed.  Therein she durst not\ntarry long, but came hurrying out on to the grass, and clad herself\nin haste.  But she covered not her shoulders with the golden gown,\nnor laced it over her bosom, so that Viridis' smock might be the\nplainer to see:  which smock was noteworthy, for the breast thereof\nwas broidered with green boughs, whence brake forth little flames of\nfire, and all so dainty-wrought as if the faery had done it.\n\nWithal she gathered up the gown into her girdle, and let the skirt-\nhem clear her ankles, so that Atra's shoon might be seen at once; and\nthey were daintily dight with window-work and broidery of gold and\ngreen stones, and blue.  And forsooth it was little likely that any\nman should stand before her a minute ere his eyes would seek to her\nfeet and ankles, so clean and kindly as they were fashioned.\n\nTherewith she set her hands to her head, and trussed up her hair, and\nbound it closely to her head, so that it might hide no whit of her\nborrowed attire.\n\nThere she stood, with Aurea's collar lying on her dear neck, and\nViridis' girdle about her shapen loins, and Atra's ring on her\nlovesome finger.  And she hearkened a while and heard no sound of\ncoming men; and there came into her heart a gentle fear, which\ngrieved her not.  Over the water before her hung an eglantine bush,\nwith its many roses either budding or but just out.  Birdalone stole\nthither softly, and said, smiling:  Nay, if I have nothing that is\nmine on my body, I will take this of the maiden's bath and make it\nmine.  And therewith she plucked a spray of the bush and turned it\ninto a garland for her head; and then when she had stood shyly a\nwhile in that same place, she turned and went swiftly to her place\nbeside her night-harbour, and stood there hearkening with that sweet\nfear growing upon her, her colour coming and going, and her heart\nbeating fast.\n\nNow the thought of that kind priest who had led her to the bower last\nnight came into her mind, and she wondered why he had been so\ntroubled.  And she thought, would those others be so kind to her, or\nwould they deem her an impudent wench or a foolish, or pass her by?\n\nForsooth if any had passed her by it had been not that he should miss\nseeing her beauty, but that he should fear it, and deem her some\ngoddess of the Gentiles of old time come before him for his\nensnaring.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  AND NOW SHE MEETS THE CHAMPIONS\n\n\n\nNow, as she stood hearkening, she deemed she heard something that was\nnot so loud as the song of the blackbird in the brake, but further\noff and longer voiced:  and again she hearkened heedfully, and the\nsound came again, and she deemed now that it was the voice of an\nhorn.  But the third time of her hearing it she knew that it was\nnought less; and at last it grew nigher, and there was mingled with\nit the sound of men shouting and the lowing of neat.\n\nThen she stepped down to the very edge of the way, and now she saw\nthe riding-reek go up into the clear air, and she said:  Now are they\ncoming without fail, and I must pluck up a heart; for surely these\ndear friends of my friends shall neither harm a poor maiden nor scorn\nher.\n\nSoon came the leading beasts from out of the dust-cloud, and behind\nthem was the glitter of spear-heads; and then presently was a herd of\nneat shambling and jostling along the road, and after them a score or\nso of spearmen in jack and sallet, who, forsooth, turned to look on\nBirdalone as they passed by, and spake here and there a word or two,\nlaughing and pointing to her, but stayed not; and all went on\nstraight to the castle.\n\nThereafter was a void, and then came riding leisurely another score\nof weaponed men, whereof some in white armour; and amongst them were\nfive sumpter horses laden with carcasses of venison.  And all these\nalso went by and stayed not, though the most of them gazed on\nBirdalone hard enough.\n\nLast of all came three knights riding, one with a gold surcoat over\nhis armour, and thereon a cleft heart of red; the second with a green\nsurcoat, and on the same a chief of silver with green boughs thereon,\ntheir ends a-flaming; but the third bore a black surcoat besprinkled\nwith silver tears.  And all these three rode bare-headed, save that\nthe Black Knight bore an oak-wreath on the head.\n\nNow did Birdalone take to her valiancy, and she stepped out into the\nroad till she was but a ten paces from those men, who reined up when\nthey beheld her; and she said in a clear voice:  Abide, warriors! for\nif ye be what I deem you, I have an errand unto you.\n\nScarce were the words out of her mouth, ere all three had leapt off\ntheir horses, and the Golden Knight came up to her, and laid his hand\nupon her side, and spake eagerly and said:  Where is she, whence thou\ngattest this gown of good web?  And thou, said she, art thou Baudoin\nthe Golden Knight?  But he set his hand to the collar on her neck,\nand touched her skin withal, and said:  This, was she alive when thou\ncamest by it?  She said:  If thou be Baudoin the Golden Knight, I\nhave an errand to thee.  I am he, said the knight; O tell me, tell\nme, is she dead?  Said Birdalone:  Aurea was alive when last I saw\nher, and mine errand is from her to thee, if thou be verily her\nlover.  Now with this word I pray thee to be content a while, said\nshe, smiling kindly upon him, for needs must I do mine errand in such\nwise as I was bidden.  And thou seest also that thy friends would\nhave a word of me.\n\nForsooth, they were thrusting in on her, and the Green Knight gat a\nhold of her left wrist in his left hand, and his right was on her\nshoulder, and his bright face close to her bosom whereon lay Viridis'\nsmock; and thereat she shrank aback somewhat, but said:  Sir, it is\nsooth that the smock is for thee when thou hast answered me a\nquestion or two.  Meanwhile I pray thee forbear a little; for, as I\ntrow, all is well, and thou shalt see my dear friend Viridis again.\n\nHe withdrew him a little, flushed and shamefaced.  He was a young man\nexceeding beauteous, clear-skinned and grey-eyed, with curly golden\nhair, and he bore his armour as though it were silken cloth.\nBirdalone looked upon him kindly though shyly, and was glad to the\nheart's root that Viridis had so lovely a man to her darling.  As for\nthe Golden Knight, as Birdalone might see now, he stood a little\naloof; he was a very goodly man of some five and thirty winters; tall\nhe was, broad-shouldered and thin-flanked, black-haired, with\nsomewhat heavy eyebrows, and fierce hawk-eyes; a man terrible of\naspect, when one first beheld him.\n\nNow when the Black Squire had hearkened Birdalone's word concerning\nViridis, he threw himself down on the ground before her, and fell to\nkissing her feet; or, if you will, Atra's shoon which covered them.\nWhen she drew back a little, he rose on one knee and looked up at her\nwith an eager face, and she said:  To thee also I have an errand from\nAtra, thy speech-friend, if thou be Arthur the Black Squire.  He\nspake not, but still gazed on her till she reddened.  She knew not\nwhether to deem him less goodly than the other twain.  He also was a\nyoung man of not over five and twenty years, slim and lithe, with\nmuch brown hair; his face tanned so dark that his eyes gleamed light\nfrom amidst it; his chin was round and cloven, his mouth and nose\nexcellently fashioned; little hair he had upon his face, his cheeks\nwere somewhat more hollow than round.  Birdalone noted of his bare\nhands, which were as brown as his face, that they were very trim and\nshapely.\n\nNow he rose to his feet, and the three stood together and gazed on\nher; as how might they do otherwise?  Birdalone hung her head, and\nknew not what next to do or say.  But she thought within herself,\nwould these three men have been as kind to her as her three friends\nof the Isle, had she happened on them in like case as she was that\ntime?  And she settled with herself that they would have been no less\nkind.\n\nNow spake the Golden Knight, and said:  Will the kind maiden do her\nerrand to us here and now? for we be eager and worn with trouble.\nBirdalone looked adown and was somewhat confused.  Fair sirs, said\nshe, I will do your will herein.\n\nBut the Black Squire looked on her and saw that she was troubled, and\nhe said:  Your pardon, fair fellows, but is it not so that we have an\nhouse somewhat anigh, not ill purveyed of many things?  By your leave\nI would entreat this kind and dear lady to honour us so much as to\nenter the Castle of the Quest with us, and abide there so long as she\nwill; and therein may she tell us all her errand at her leisure; and\nalready we may see and know, that it may not be aught save a joyous\none.\n\nThen spake the Golden Knight, and said:  I will ask the lady to\npardon me, and will now join my prayer to thine, brother, that she\ncome home with us.  Lady, he said, wilt thou not pardon me, that in\nthe eager desire to hear tidings of my speech-friend I forgat all\nelse.\n\nAnd therewithal he knelt before her, and took her hand and kissed it;\nand for all his fierce eyes and his warrior's mien, she deemed him\nkind and friendly.  Then needs must the Green Knight kneel and kiss\nalso, though he had no pardon to crave; but a fair sweet lad she\nthought him, and again her heart swelled with joy to think that her\nfriend Viridis had so dear a speech-friend to long for her.\n\nThen came the turn of the Black Squire, and by then were the two\nothers turned away a little toward their horses; and he knelt down on\nboth knees before Birdalone and took her right arm above the wrist,\nand looked at the hand and kissed it as if it were a relic, but stood\nnot up; and she stood bending over him, and a new sweetness entered\ninto her, the like of which she had never felt.  But as for the Black\nSquire, it seemed that one hand would not suffice him, and he took\nher left hand and fell to kissing it, and then both the hands\ntogether all over the backs of them, and then the palms thereof, and\nhe buried his face in the two palms, and held them to his cheeks; and\nthe dear hands suffered it all, and consented to the embracing of his\ncheeks.  But Birdalone deemed that this was the kindest and sweetest\nof the three kind warriors, and sorry she was when he let go her\nhands and stood up.\n\nHis face was flushed, but his speech calm, as he spake so that the\nother knights might hear him:  Now will we straight to the castle,\nlady, and we will ask thee which of us three thou wilt honour by\nriding his horse there; shall it be Baudoin's bright bay, or Hugh's\ndapple-grey, or my red roan?  And therewith he took her by the hand\nand led her toward the horses.  But she laughed, and turning a\nlittle, pointed to the castle, and said:  Nay, sweet lords, but I\nwill fare afoot, such a little way as it is, and I all unwont to the\nsaddle.\n\nSpake the Green Knight:  If that be so, lady, then shall we three\nwalk afoot with thee.  Nay, nay, she said; I have nought to carry but\nmyself; but ye have your byrnies and your other armour, which were\nheavy for you to drag on afoot, even a little way.  Moreover, I were\nfain to see you mount your horses, and ride and run about the meadow\nwith tossing manes and flashing swords, while I trudge quietly toward\nthe gate; for such things, and so beauteous, are all new unto me, as\nye shall learn presently when I tell you my story.  Do so much to\npleasure me, kind knights.\n\nThe tall Baudoin nodded to her, smiling kindly, as much as to say\nthat he thought well of her desire.  But the Green Knight ran to his\nhorse with a glad shout, and anon was in the saddle with his bright\nsword in his fist; then he spurred, and went a-gallop hither and\nthither over the mead, making his horse turn short and bound, and\nplaying many tricks of the tilt-yard, and crying, A Hugh, A Hugh, for\nthe Green Gown!  The Golden Knight was slower and more staid, but in\nmanywise he showed his war-deftness, riding after Hugh as if he would\nfall on him, and staying his way just as it became perilous; and he\ncried, Baudoin, Baudoin, for Gold-sleeves!  And all this seemed to\nBirdalone both terrible and lovely.\n\nBut for the Black Squire, he was slow to let loose Birdalone's hand;\nbut thereafter he was speedy to vault into his saddle, and he made\ncourses over the meadow, but ever came back to Birdalone as she went\nher ways, riding round and round her, and tossing his sword into the\nair the while and catching it as it fell.  And no less lovely did\nthis seem to Birdalone, and she smiled on him and waved her hand to\nhim.\n\nGoing slowly in this wise, she came at last to the castle gate; and\nnow had all those three out-gone her and stood afoot in the wicket to\nwelcome her, and the Golden Knight, who was the oldest of the three,\nwas the speaker of the welcome.\n\nOver the threshold of the Castle of the Quest went Birdalone's feet\nthen, and she was grown so happy as she had never deemed she should\nbe all her life long.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  BIRDALONE HAS TRUE TOKENS FROM THE CHAMPIONS OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nNow they brought Birdalone into a very fair chamber, where was\npresently everything she might need, save a tiring woman, which,\nforsooth, was no lack unto her, since never had she had any to help\nher array her body.  So she did what she might to make herself the\ntrimmer; and in a while came two fair swains of service, who brought\nher in all honour into the great hall, where were the three lords\nabiding her.  There were they served well and plenteously, and fair\nwas the converse between them; and in especial was the talk of Arthur\nthe Black Squire goodly and wise and cheery, and well-measured; and\nthe Green Knight's speech merry and kind, as of an happy child; and\nthe Golden Knight spake ever free and kindly, though not of many\nwords was he.  And who was happy if Birdalone were not?\n\nBut when they had eaten and washed their hands, then spake the Golden\nKnight:  Dear maiden, now are we ready to hear the innermost of thine\nerrand, all we together, if thou wilt.\n\nBirdalone smiled and reddened withal, as she said:  Fair lords, I\ndoubt not but ye are even they unto whom I was sent, but they who\nsent me, and who saved me from death and worse, bade me do mine\nerrand in such a way, that I should speak with each one of you\nprivily, and that for a token each should tell me a thing known but\nto him and his love, and to me unto whom she hath told it.  Now am I\nall ready to do mine errand thus, and no other wise.\n\nLaughed they now, and were merry, and the Green Knight blushed like a\nmaiden; forsooth like to his very speech-friend Viridis.  But the\nBlack Squire said:  Fair fellows, get we all into the pleasance this\nfair morn, and sit there on the grass, and our sweet lady shall take\nus one after other into the plashed alley, and have the tokens of us.\n\nEven so they did, and went into the pleasance, which was a goodly\nlittle garth south of the castle, grassed, and set thick with roses\nand lilies and gillyflowers, and other fragrant flowers.  There then\nthey sat on the daisied greensward, the three lords together, and\nBirdalone over against them, and they three watched her beauty and\nloveliness and wondered thereat.\n\nBut she said:  Now it comes to the very point of mine errand;\nwherefore I bid thee, Baudoin the Golden Knight, to come apart with\nme and answer to my questions, so that I may know surely that I am\ndoing mine errand aright.\n\nTherewith she arose to her feet, and he also, and he led her into the\nplashed alley, out of earshot of the other twain, who lay upon the\ngrass biding their turn with but little patience.\n\nBut when those two were in the deep shade of the alley, Birdalone\nsaid:  Thou must know, Sir Golden Knight, that the three lovers of\nyou three were good to me in my need, and clad my nakedness from\ntheir very bodies, but this raiment they lent me, and gave it not;\nfor they bade me give it up piece by piece each unto the one who had\ngiven it to his love, whom I should know by the token that he should\ntell truly the tale of its giving.  Now, fair sir, I know well, for I\nhave been told, what was the tale of thy giving this golden gown to\nAurea, and that same tale shalt thou now tell me, and if thou tell it\naright, then is the gown thine.  Begin, then, without more tarrying.\n\nLady, said the knight, thus it was:  Aurea, my sweetling, abode with\nan ancient dame, a kinswoman of hers, who was but scantly kind to\nher; and on a day when we had met privily, and were talking together,\nmy love lamented the niggard ways of her said kinswoman, and told how\nshe had no goodly gown to make her fair when feasts were toward; but\nI laughed at her, and told her that so clad as she was (and her\nattire was verily but simple) she was fairer than any other; and\nthen, as ye may wot, there was kissing and clipping between us; but\nat last, as from the first I meant it, I promised her I would purvey\nher such a gown as no lady should go with a better in all the\ncountry-side; but I said that in return I must have the gown she went\nin then, which had so long embraced her body and been strained so\nclose to her body and her sides, and was as it were a part of her.\nThat she promised me with kisses, and I went away as merry as a bird.\nStraightway thereafter I did do make this very gown, which thou\nbearest, dear maiden, and on the appointed day she came out to me\nunto the same place clad as she was before; but the new gown I had\nwith me.  Hard by our trysting-place was a hazel-copse thick enow,\nfor it was midsummer, and she said she would go thereinto and shift\ngowns, and bear me out thence the gift of the old clout (so she\ncalled it, laughing merrily).  But I said:  Nay, I would go into the\ncopse with her to guard her from evil things, beasts or men; and\nwithal to see her do off the old gown, that I might know before I\nwedded her whatlike stuffing and padding went to make the grace of\nher flanks and her hips.  And again was she merry, and she said:\nCome, then, thou Thomas unbelieving, and see the side of me.  So we\nwent into that cover together, and she did off her gown before mine\neyes, and stood there in her white coat with her arms bare, and her\nshoulders and bosom little covered, and she was as lovely as a woman\nof the faery.  Then I made no prayer unto her for leave, but took my\narms about her, and kissed her arms and shoulders and bosom all she\nwould suffer me, for I was mad with love of her naked flesh.  Then\nshe did on this golden gown, and departed when she had given me the\nold clout aforesaid, and I went away with it, scarce feeling the\nground beneath my feet; and I set the dear gown in a fair little\ncoffer, and here in this castle I have it now, and many times I take\nit forth and kiss it and lay my head upon it.  Now this is a simple\ntale, lady, and I am ashamed that I have made it so long for thee.\nAnd yet I know not; for thou seemest to me so kind and loving and\ntrue, that I am fain that thou shouldest know how sorely I love thy\nfriend and mine.\n\nBirdalone deemed Baudoin a good man indeed, and the tears came into\nher eyes as she answered and said:  True is thy tale, dear friend,\nand I have deemed it rather short than long.  I see well that thou\nart Aurea's very lover; and it joys me to think that thou, O terrible\nchampion, art yet so tender and true.  Now is the golden gown thine,\nbut I will pray thee to lend it me a little longer.  But this jewel\nshalt thou have from my neck here and now; and thou knowest whence it\ncame, thine Aurea's neck forsooth.\n\nTherewith she betook it him, and he held it in his hand doubtfully a\nwhile, and then he said:  Dear maiden, I thank thee, but I will take\nthis collar, and lay it in my casket, and be glad thereof; and that\nthe more, as, now I look on thee, I see nought missing from the\nloveliness of thine own neck.\n\nGo to thy fellows now, said Birdalone, and send me the Green Knight,\nthe goodly lad.  So went he, and presently came Hugh thither merry\nand smiling, and said:  Thou hast been long about the first token,\nsweet mistress; I fear me I shall make no such goodly story as hath\nBaudoin.  And yet, said she, Viridis' tale was the longest of all.  I\ndoubt thou mayst fail in the token.  And she laughed; and he no less,\nand took her by the shoulders, and kissed her cheek frankly, and in\nsuch wise that she feared him nought, and said:  Now that is to pay\nthee for thy gibe; what wouldst thou have of me?  Said Birdalone:  I\nwould have thee tell me how it was that Viridis came by the smock\nwith the green boughs aflame, which now I bear upon me.\n\nHearken, darling lady, said he:  On a day Viridis and I were alone in\nthe meadow, and so happy, that we might find nought to do save to\nfall into strife together; and I said it to her, that she loved me\nnot as well as I loved her; which, by the way, was no less than a\nlie, for of all things living she is the most loving, and when we be\ntogether she knoweth not how to make enough of me.  Well, we fell to\nwrangling after the manner of lovers, till I, having nothing else to\nsay, bade her remember that since we had first come to love each\nother, I had given her many things, and she had given me nothing.\nLo, then! my dear, what an ill-conditioned lad was I.  But, little as\nI meant it, she took it all amiss, and leapt up, and fell to running\nback home over the meadow; thou mayst think how easily I caught up\nwith her, and how little loth she was to be dragged back by the\nshoulders.  So when we were sitting again under the thorn-bush, we\nhad well-nigh done our wrangle; but she unlaced her gown and drew\ndown a corner thereof, to show me her shoulder, how I had hurt it\ne'en now; and forsooth some little mark there was on the rose-leaf\nskin; and that made good time for kissing again, as ye may well wot.\nThen she said unto me:  And how may I, a poor damsel, give thee\ngifts, and my kindred all greedy about me?  Yet would I give thee a\ngift, such as I may, if I but knew what thou wouldst take.  Now my\nheart was afire with that kissing of her shoulder, and I said that I\nwould have that very same smock from her body, which then she bore,\nand that thereof I should deem that I had a rich gift indeed.  What!\nsaid she, and wouldst thou have it here and now?  And indeed I think\nshe would have done it off her that minute had I pressed her, but I\nlacked the boldness thereto; and I said:  Nay, but would she bring it\nunto me the next time we met; and forsooth she brought it folded in a\npiece of green silk, and dearly have I loved it and kissed it\nsithence.  But as for thy smock, I had it fairly wrought and\nembroidered with the flaming green branches, as thou seest it, and I\ngave it to her; but not on the day when she gave me the gift; for the\nnew one was long about doing.  Now this is all the tale, and how\nViridis might eke it into a long one, I wot not.  But let it be, and\ntell me, have I won thy smock, or lost it?\n\nBirdalone laughed on him and said:  Well, at least thou shalt have it\nas a gift; and thou mayst call it given either by Viridis or me,\nwhich thou wilt.  But with it goes another gift; which thou mayst\nhave at once since thou must lend me the smock a little longer.  And\ntherewith she betook him her girdle, and he kissed it, but said:\nNay, fair lady, this befitteth well the loveliness of thy body that\nthou shouldst wear it; and well it befitteth the truth and love of\nthy soul toward it for me; I pray thee to keep it.  Nevertheless, she\nsaid, I will not have it, for it goeth with mine errand that thou\ntake it of me.  Now I bid thee depart, and send hither thy fellow,\nthe Black Squire.\n\nWent he then, and anon comes the Black Squire, and now that he was\nalone with Birdalone this first time, he seemed moody and downcast,\nall unlike the two others.  He stood a little aloof from Birdalone,\nand said:  What wouldst thou ask of me?  Her heart was somewhat\nchilled by his moodiness, for erst had she deemed him the kindest of\nthe three; but she said:  It is of mine errand to ask of thee\nconcerning this foot-gear which Atra lent me until I give it unto\nthee, if thou be verily her lover.  Said he:  I was verily her lover.\nBirdalone said:  Then canst thou tell me the manner of thy giving\nthese fair shoon unto Atra?\n\nHe said:  Even so; we were walking together in this country-side and\ncame to a ford of the river, and it was somewhat deep and took me to\nover the knee, so I bore her over in my arms; then we went on a\nlittle further till we must cross the river back again in another\nplace, and there the ford was shallower, and, the day being hot, Atra\nmust needs wade it on her own feet.  So she did off hosen and shoon,\nand I led her by the hand, and it took her but up to mid-leg.  But\nwhen we came up out of the water and were on the grass again, I\ncraved the gift of her foot-gear for the love of her, and she gave it\nstraightway, and fared home barefoot, for it was over the meads we\nwere wending in early summer, and the grass was thick and soft.  But\nthereafter I did do make the fair shoon which thou hast on thy feet,\nand gave them to her.  And, for a further token that my tale is true,\nI shall tell thee that the name of the first ford we waded that day\nis the Grey-nag's Wade, and the second is called Goat Ford.  This is\nall my tale, lady; is the token true?\n\nTrue it is, squire, said Birdalone, and was silent awhile, and he\nalso.  Then she looked on him friendly, and said:  Thou art out of\nheart as now, my friend.  Fear not, for thou shalt without doubt see\nthy speech-friend again.  Moreover here is a ring which she set upon\nmy finger, bidding me give it thee.  And she held it out unto him.\n\nHe took the ring, and said:  Yea, it is best that I have it of thee,\nlest unluck come thereof.  She saw trouble in his face, but knew not\nwhat to say to cheer him, and they stood silently facing one another\nfor awhile.  Then he said:  Let us back to our fellows, and talk it\nover, what is now to be done.\n\nSo they went their ways to where lay the other two upon the green\ngrass, and the Black Squire lay down beside them; but Birdalone stood\nbefore them and spake unto the three.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.  HOW THE CHAMPIONS WOULD DO BIRDALONE TO BE CLAD ANEW IN\nTHE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nLords, she said, now is it clear by the tokens that mine errand is to\nyou and none other; now therefore am I to tell you what to do to come\nunto your speech-friends and deliver them and bring them back hither.\nFor this is their case, that they are in captivity in a wonder-isle\nof this great water, and it is called the Isle of Increase Unsought.\n\nSpake the Golden Knight:  Fair lady, we have heard before that our\nfriends fared hence, or rather were taken hence over the water.  And\nthat is the cause why we builded this castle on the water's edge, on\nthe very stead where was raised the pavilion, the house made for the\nladies to abide therein the battle of the Champions.  Since that\ntime, moreover, many a barge and keel have we thrust out into the\nwater, that we might accomplish the Quest whereunto we were vowed;\nbut ever one way went our seafaring, that when we were come so far\nout into the water as to lose sight of land, came upon us mist, rose\nagainst us dusk and darkness; and then a fierce driving wind that\ndrave us back to this shore.  It is but six days ago since we tried\nthis adventure for the last time, and belike the same shall befall us\nthe next time we try it.  Wherefore I must ask thee, lady, dost thou\nknow any way whereby we may come to the said isle?  For if thou dost,\nfull surely we will try it, whatsoever may be the risk thereby to our\nbodies or our souls.\n\nFull surely I do, said Birdalone; else how had I come from thence\nhither mine own self?  And therewith she told them of the Sending\nBoat, what it was, and how she had come all the way by means thereof\nfrom the Isle of Increase Unsought; and they all hearkened her\nheedfully, and wondered both at the sorcery, and the valiant heart of\nher who had driven it as she would in despite of the evil.  But in\nthe end she spake and said:  Lords, ye have now heard some deal of my\nstory, even that which concerns you thereof; and which must needs be\ntold at once:  wherefore doubtless ye shall fare unto your speech-\nfriends by this ferry in the very wise that I shall show you; unless\nperchance ye deem that I have been lying and making light tales to\nyou, as, sooth to say, I deem ye think it not.\n\nSpake the Golden Knight:  Damsel, in all wise we trow in thee and thy\ntale.  And God forbid that we should tarry!  Go we hence this very\nday.\n\nYea, but hearken, said the Black Squire:  Is it not a part of this\ndamsel's errand that she should deliver to us the raiment of our\nfriends, which now she beareth on her own body, that we may bear it\nback unto them?\n\nSooth is that, said Birdalone, and ye may well wot that this may be\nnought but needful, whereas the said ladies be all beset by\nsorceries.\n\nSee ye then, fellows, said the Black Squire, it may not be to-day nor\nyet to-morrow that we may take the road.  For ye wot that there is no\nwoman's gear in all the castle, and we must needs send otherwhere to\nseek it.\n\nLook thou, maiden, said the Golden Knight, laughing, how duly this\nyoung knight thinketh of thee; whereas I, who am his elder, and\nshould be wiser than he, am but heedless of thee.  I pray thy pardon.\n\nMoreover, said the Black Squire, there may well be wisdom in abiding;\nfor it is to be thought that our dear loves considered this, and knew\nwhat the time of tarrying should be, and have so dight their matter\nas to fit in therewith; and I may not deem it of them that they would\nhave us array this our dear sister and theirs in unseemly wise.  Nay,\nfor that would be an ill beginning of this deal of the Quest.\n\nNow all yeasaid this gladly; and the Green Knight said:  It were not\nso ill done that we should see more of our sister here ere we depart,\nand hear more of her tale; for meseemeth she began it erewhile but\nhalf-way.  And he turned to Birdalone, and took her hand and caressed\nit.\n\nBirdalone smiled on them somewhat shyly, and thanked them; but bade\nthem spend as little time as might be on her arrayal.  For, said she,\nthough those ladies may well have reckoned on the time of the arrayal\nof my body, yet surely also they shall have reckoned with the eager\nfire of love in the hearts of you, and the haste it shall breed\ntherein.\n\nWell pleased were they with that word of hers, but none the less sent\ntwo sergeants and a squire with led horses unto the cheaping-town, a\ngoodly and great town hight Greenford, which was some twenty miles\nthence, with the errand to bring back with them a good shaper and\nembroideress, and sewing-women, and cloth and silk and linen, and all\nthings needful.\n\nAs for jewels, each one of them was fain to give her something which\nhe prized, and fair and rich were the gifts, though they had not been\nmade for women.  As a fair SS collar of gold, which the Golden Knight\ngave her, and a girdle of broad golden plates, wrought beauteously,\nwhich was the gift of the Black Squire.  Albeit he did not offer to\nclasp it round her loins, as she deemed he would; for when the Green\nKnight brought his gift, a great gold ring, very ancient of fashion,\nhe would have her turn back the sleeve from her fore-arm, that he\nmight set his dwarf-wrought gold upon the bare flesh; neither did he\nrefrain him from kissing it withal.\n\nBut the messengers came back with their work-women and stuffs early\non the morrow; and now was changed all the manner of the womanless\ncastle, and men were full merry therein.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.  OF BIRDALONE, HOW SHE TOLD THE CHAMPIONS ALL HER TALE\n\n\n\nIt was a matter of eight days, the making of all Birdalone's raiment,\nand meanwhile she was ever with the three Champions, either all three\ntogether, or one or other of them.  And as to their manners with her,\never was the Golden Knight of somewhat sober demeanour, as if he were\nan older man than he verily was.  The Green Knight was for ever\npraising Birdalone's beauty to her face, and seemed to find it no\neasy matter to keep his eyes off her, and somewhat he wearied her\nwith kisses and caresses; but a gay and sportive lad he was; and when\nshe rebuked him for his overmuch fondness, as now and again she did,\nhe would laugh at himself along with her; and in sooth she deemed him\nheart-whole, and of all truth to Viridis, and oft he would talk of\nher to Birdalone, and praise her darling beauty to her, and tell of\nhis longing for his love aloof.  Only, quoth he, here art thou, my\nsister, dwelling amongst us, and shedding thy fragrance on us, and\nshowing to us, wilt thou, wilt thou not, as do the flowers, all the\ngrace and loveliness of thee; and thou so tender of heart withal,\nthat thou must not blame me overmuch if whiles I forget that thou art\nmy sister, and that my love is, woe's me! far away.  So thou wilt\npardon me, wilt thou not?  Yea, verily, said she, with a whole heart.\nYet thou needest not reach out for my hand; thou hast had enough of\nit this morning.  And she hid it, laughing, in the folds of her gown;\nand he laughed also, and said:  Of a truth thou art good in all wise,\nand a young fool am I; but Viridis shall make me wiser, when we come\ntogether again.  Sawest thou ever so fair a damsel?  Never, she said,\nand surely there is none fairer in all the world.  So hold thee aloof\nnow for a while, and think of her.\n\nAs for the Black Squire, hight Arthur, Birdalone was troubled for\nhim, and he made her somewhat sad.  True it is that he came not\nbefore her again so moody and downcast as when he was giving her the\ntoken; yet she deemed that he enforced himself to seem of good cheer.\nFurthermore, though he sought her company ever, and that lonely with\nhim, and would talk with her almost as one man with another, though\nwith a certain tenderness in his voice, and looking earnestly on her\nthe while, yet never would he take her hand, or touch her in any\nwise.  And true it is that she longed for the touch of his hand.\n\nOn the third day of her sojourn in the Castle of the Quest, Birdalone\ntook heart at the much egging of her friends, as they sat all\ntogether in the meadow without the castle, to tell them all the story\nof her; she hid none, save concerning the wood-mother, for she deemed\nthat her sweet friend would love her the better if she babbled not of\nher.\n\nSo the Champions hearkened her telling the tale in her clear lovely\nvoice, and great was their love and pity for the poor lonely maiden.\nAnd in especial clear it was to see that they were sore moved when\nshe told how she first came on the Sending Boat, and how the witch-\nwife tormented her innocent body for that guilt.  Then Baudoin laid\nhis hand upon her head, and spake:  Poor child, much indeed hast thou\nsuffered! and now I will say it, that it was for us and our loves\nthat thou hast borne all this anguish of captivity and toil and\nstripes.\n\nBut Hugh leaned over to her, as she sat with her head hanging down,\nand kissed her cheek, and said:  Yea! and I was not there to smite\nthe head off that accursed one; and I knew nought of thee and thine\nanguish, as I took my light pleasure about these free meadows.  And\nhe turned very red, and went nigh to weep.\n\nArthur sat still with his eyes bent down on the ground, and he said\nnothing; and Birdalone glanced on him wistfully ere she went on with\nher tale.  And she went on and told closely all that had happened\nunto her in the crossing of the water and on the Isle of Increase\nUnsought, and the other Wonder Isles; and she deemed it not too much\nthat she should tell it twice over, nor they that twice over they\nshould hearken it.\n\nThat same evening as Birdalone walked by herself in the castle\npleasance, she saw Arthur peering about as if he were seeking\nsomeone; so she stood forth, and asked him was he seeking aught; and\nhe said:  Thee was I seeking.  But she durst not ask him what he\nwould, but stood silent and trembling before him, till he took her\nhand, and spake not loud but eagerly.\n\nAfter what thou hast told us to-day, I seem to know thee what thou\nart; and I tell thee that it is a pain and grief to me to leave thee,\nyea to leave thee were it but for a minute.  O I pray thee pity me\nfor the sundering.  And therewith he turned about and hastened into\nthe castle.  But Birdalone stood there with her heart beating fast\nand her flesh quivering, and a strange sweetness of joy took hold of\nher.  But she said to herself that it was no wonder though she felt\nso happy, seeing that she had found out that, despite her fears, this\none of her friends loved her no less well than the others.  And then\nshe spake it in a soft voice that she would indeed pity him for the\nsundering, yea, and herself also.\n\nNevertheless, when they met thereafter, his demeanour to her was none\notherwise than it had been; but she no longer heeded this since now\nshe trowed in him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.  IN THE MEANWHILE OF THE DEPARTING OF THE CHAMPIONS,\nTHEY WOULD PLEASURE BIRDALONE WITH FEATS OF ARMS AND GAMES OF PROWESS\n\n\n\nPassed the days now speedily, and the three Champions did what they\nmight for the solace of Birdalone.  For they and their household\nshowed her of arms, and they tilted together courteously; and the\nsergeants stood forth, and shot in the bow before her, till she\nherself by their bidding took the bow in hand, and shot straighter\nand well-nigh as hard as the best man there, whereat they marvelled,\nand praised her much.\n\nThen the young men ran afoot before her for the prize of a belt and\nknife, and forsooth she wotted well that were she to run against them\nwith trussed-up skirts she would bear off the prize; but she had no\nheart thereto, for amidst them all, and her new friendships, she had\ngrown shamefast, and might play the wood-maiden no longer.  Yet twice\nthe Champions fared further afield with her to show her some\nwoodcraft; yet were not very free to go far, because of the ill\nneighbours whereof the chaplain had told her that first night of her\ncoming.\n\nAnd in all these pastimes, whatso they were, Birdalone bore herself\nwell and merrily, and put from her the sorrow of the sundering, and\nthe peril of her dear friends which grew now so near at hand.\n\nThe chaplain aforesaid, who hight Leonard, she fell in with not\nseldom; and he was ever meek and humble before her; and ever withal\nwas sorrow easy to be seen in his countenance, and trouble withal;\nand she knew not how to help him, save by being courteous and kind\nwith him whenso they met; but none the more might he pluck up\ncheerful countenance in answer to her kindness.\n\nWith Sir Aymeris, the grizzle-haired castellan, she foregathered also\noft enough, and could not forbear some merry gibes with him\nconcerning their first meeting, and how that she had been a burden\nand a terror to him; and these mocks she made him because she saw it\nliked him not ill to be mocked in friendly fashion; though forsooth\nbetwixt the laughter he looked on her somewhat ruefully.  And ever,\nere he parted from her, he made occasion to kiss her hands; and she\nsuffered it smiling, and was debonair to him; whereas she saw that he\nwas of good will to her.  In such wise then wore the hours and the\ndays.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.  BIRDALONE COMETH BEFORE THE CHAMPIONS IN HER NEW ARRAY\n\n\n\nNow the time was come when Birdalone had all her gear ready, and the\nwomen were to abide in the castle as her serving-damsels while the\nChampions were away.\n\nSo now in the summer eve, an hour before sunset, Birdalone did on the\nrichest of her new raiment, and came into the hall where sat the\nThree together, and Sir Aymeris with them.  She was so clad, that she\nhad on a green gown with broidered sleeves, and thereover a white\ncote-hardie welted with gold, and gold-embroidered; on her feet were\ngold shoon of window-work, pearled and gemmed; and on her head a rose\ngarland; on her neck she bore the Golden Knight's collar; her loins\nwere girt with the Black Squire's girdle; and on her wrist was the\nGreen Knight's ancient gold ring; and she carried in her arms Aurea's\ngown and Viridis' shift and Atra's shoon.\n\nRather sunrise than sunset it seemed, as verily Birdalone she came\ninto the hall with bright eager eyes, and flushed cheeks, and\ncountenance smiling with love.  The men stood up all, and would come\ndown from the dais to meet her; but she bade them go back, and sit\neach in his place till she stood before them.\n\nUp the hall then she walked, and every step of hers seemed lovelier\nthan the last, till she came to them and gave unto each his keepsake,\nand said:  Champions, now is mine errand all done, save that to-\nmorrow I must show you the manner of the Sending Boat.  Now there is\nnought save the darkness of the coming night to hinder you from this\nlast deal of your Quest; and it is I that have brought you to this,\nand have done this good unto you, if no more good I do in the world.\nWherefore I pray you to love me ever, and bear me ever in your minds.\n\nThey gazed on her, and were overcome by her loveliness and grace, and\nby the kindness and valiancy of her heart.  Next arose the Golden\nKnight, Baudoin to wit, and took a cross from his breast, and held it\nup, and spake:  Maiden, thou sayest well, and never shall we forget\nthee, or cease to love thee; and here I swear by God upon the Tree,\nthat it shall be a light thing for me to die for thee, if in any need\nI find thee.  Brethren, will ye not swear the same?  And this is but\nthy due, maiden, for I declare unto thee, that when thou didst enter\nthe hall e'en now, it was as if the very sun of heaven was coming in\nunto us.\n\nThereon the other two took the Rood and swore upon it:  and Hugh was\nhushed and meek and sad-faced after he had sworn; but Arthur the\nBlack Squire bowed down his head and wept, and his fellows marvelled\nnought thereat, neither did Birdalone; and all her body yearned\ntoward him to solace him.\n\nNow turned Sir Baudoin to the castellan and said:  Sir Aymeris, I\nwill now swear thee to guard this lady as the apple of thine eye\nwhiles we three be away, and therein to spare neither thyself nor\nothers.  For thou seest well what grief it would be to us if she came\nto any harm.\n\nAnd to me also, said the castellan.  And therewith he swore upon the\nRood, and then came round the table, and knelt before Birdalone, and\nkissed her hands.\n\nThereafter were they all silent a space; and then came Birdalone to\nthe inner side of the table and sat betwixt Baudoin and Hugh.  But\nthe Black Squire took up the word and spake:  Birdalone, sweet child,\none thing is to be said, to wit, that it were well that thou keep\nwithin walls while we be away; or at least that thou go but a little\nbeyond the castle, and never but within a half bowshot, save thou be\nwell accompanied.  For there be men of violence dwelling no great way\noff, reivers and rovers, who would be well pleased to take from us\nanything which we deem dear; besides others who would think the\nlifting of such a jewel good hap indeed.  Sir Aymeris, have a care of\nthe Red Knight; and if thou mightest come by a few more stout lads,\nto wage them, it were well.\n\nBirdalone heeded not what the castellan answered, such a shaft of joy\nwent to her heart when she heard that friend speak her own name in\nsuch wise as he had never done erst, and that before them all.  She\nbut murmured some yeasay to that which Arthur had spoken unto her,\nand then she held her peace for the sweetness of that moment.\n\nSo there they sat and talked a while in dear and pleasant converse;\nand Hugh fell to asking her of her life in the House under the Wood,\nand she answered all frankly and simply, and the more she told the\ndearer she seemed to them.\n\nThus drew night in, till folk came flockmeal into the hall; for needs\nmust be feast and banquet for triumph of the furtherance of the\nQuest; and the most of men were merry; but somewhat sober were all\nthe three Champions, so that whoso ran might read it in their faces.\nAs for Birdalone, she showed cheerful to all that folk which loved\nher and praised her; but inwardly sorrow had come home to her heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.  THE CHAMPIONS GO THEIR WAYS IN THE SENDING BOAT\n\n\n\nWhen the sun was arisen on the morrow the three Champions went down\nto the landing-place, and there was none with them; for they had\ngiven command that no man should pry into their doings.  Thither to\nthem cometh Birdalone, clad no more in her gay attire, but in a\nstrait black coat and with unshod feet; and she looked no sorrier\nthan she was.\n\nBy Birdalone's rede the Champions bore down in their own hands the\nvictual and weapons and armour that they needed for the voyage; for\nshe knew not but that the Sending Boat might take it amiss that any\nshould touch her save the senders.  And when they had done lading\nher, then all four stood together by the water's edge, and Birdalone\nspake to her friends, and again bade them beware of the wiles of the\nIsle of Nothing; and again she told them of the woful images of the\nIsle of Kings and the Isle of Queens, and the strange folk of the\nIsle of the Young and the Old.  Then she said:  Now when ye come to\nthe Isle of Increase Unsought, what think ye to do?  Said the Green\nKnight:  If I might rule, we should go straight up to the witch\nsitting in her hall, as thou toldest us, my dear, and then and there\nsmite the head from off her.  His eyes flashed and his brow knitted,\nand so fierce he looked that Birdalone shrank back from him; but the\nBlack Squire smiled and said:  It may come to the smiting off of\nheads in the end; yet must we so fashion our carving, that it avail\nus for the freeing of our friends; else may the witch die, and the\nsecret of the prison-house die with her.  How sayest thou, dear\nBirdalone?\n\nShe reddened at the caress of his voice, and answered:  By my rede ye\nshall seek and find your speech-friends ere ye make open war upon the\nwitch; else may her malice destroy them ere ye undo her.  Her face\nflushed yet more as she spake again:  But concerning all things, I\ndeem that Atra may give you the best rede, when ye have met the\nloves; for that she knoweth more of the isle and its guiles than the\nothers.\n\nQuoth Baudoin:  Herein is wisdom, sweet maiden, for as guileless as\nthou mayst be; and so far as we may we shall follow thy rede; but all\nlieth in the fathom of the coming time.  And now this moment is the\nmoment of sundering and farewell.\n\nCame he then to Birdalone and took his two hands about her head, and\nlifted her face unto him, and kissed it kindly, as a father might\nkiss a daughter, and said:  Farewell, dear child, and take heed to\nthe word that Arthur spake yesterday, and go not from the castle even\na little way save with good and sure company.\n\nThen came Hugh to her, and took her hand somewhat timidly; but she\nput up her face to him in simple wise, and he kissed either cheek of\nher, and said no more than:  Farewell, Birdalone!\n\nLastly came Arthur, and stood before her a little; and then he knelt\ndown on the stones before her and kissed her feet many times, and she\nshuddered and caught her breath as they felt his kisses; but neither\nhe nor she spake a word, and he stood up and turned away at once\ntoward the Sending Boat, and boarded her first of the three; and the\nothers followed straightway.\n\nThereafter the Champions bared each an arm, and let blood flow thence\ninto a bowl, and reddened stem and stern of their barge, and then all\nthree spake the spell together thus, as Birdalone had taught them:\n\n\nThe red raven-wine now\nHast thou drunk, stern and bow:\nWake then, and awake,\nAnd the northern way take!\nThe way of the Wenders forth over the flood,\nFor the will of the Senders is blent with the blood.\n\n\nWent all as before thereafter, that the Sending Boat stirred under\nthem, and then turned about and pointed her bows to the northward,\nand sped swiftly over the waters.  It was a fair sunny day, with no\ncloud, nought save the summer haze lying on the lake far away.\nBirdalone stood watching the speeding of the boat, till she could see\nit no longer, not even as a fleck on the face of the waters.  Then\nshe turned away and went toward her chamber, saying to herself that\nthe sundering was easier to bear than she had deemed it would be, and\nthat she had a many things to do that day.  But when she came into\nher chamber, and shut the door, she looked about her on the things\nwhich had grown so familiar to her in these few latter days, and she\nstood watching the bright sunshine that streamed across the floor and\nlay warm upon her feet; then she took three steps toward the window,\nand saw the lake lying all a-glitter under the sun, and her heart\nfailed her withal, and she had no might so much as to think about her\nsorrow and caress it, but fell down where she was swooning on to the\nfloor, and lay there, while all the house began to stir about her.\n\n\nHere ends the Third Part of the Water of the Wondrous Isles, which is\ncalled Of the Castle of the Quest, and begins the fourth Part of the\nsaid tale, which is called Of the Days of Abiding.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOURTH PART:  OF THE DAYS OF ABIDING\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.  OF BIRDALONE'S GRIEF; AND OF LEONARD THE CHAPLAIN\n\n\n\nNow came Birdalone to herself, and that was but little joy unto her,\nand she yet lay still on the floor for a while, for she loathed the\nhour that was to come.  Then the life stirred in her, and whereas she\nwould not that her women should find her there, she stood up, and\nclad herself somewhat more seemly; yet she did on her black raiment;\nand determined in her mind that nought would she wear save black\nunadorned while her friends were away.\n\nShe betook her now to the chamber where her women were gathered\ntogether, and watched them working a while, but spake nought.  Then\nshe went her ways into the pleasance, and paced the plashed alley up\nand down, letting the tears run down from her as they would.  Then\nshe turned back into the castle, and went out-a-gates and walked over\nthe meadow a little, and might well have gone further than wisdom\nwould.  But the castellan espied her from a window, and came hurrying\nout after her, and with many prayers for pardon, brought her back\nagain, babbling to her by the way; but not a word might he get from\nher; and when he came into the hall with her, and, after his wont,\nknelt down to kiss her hands, she caught them away from him\npeevishly, and was sorry for it thereafter.\n\nLong she sat in the hall, scarce moving, till she heard one entering\nfrom the screen, and lo it was Leonard the chaplain.  He came her\nway, and showed her rueful countenance; and pity of him smote her,\nand she remembered therewith how they first went out of gates\ntogether; and at the thought thereof her tears brake forth again, but\nshe made him a sign with her hand to sit down beside her, and he did\nso; and when she might for her weeping, she looked kindly on him, and\nhe fell to talk, making as if he noted not her tears and sorrow; but\nshe answered him little, for she had shame to begin the talk\nconcerning the Champions and their Quest, and their departure; yet\nmight she not bring her tongue to make any speech else.  But\npresently he took up the word, and asked her how long a while she\ndeemed they would be away, and she answered, smiling on him for\nthanks, and having reckoned the days on her fingers:  If all go\nbetter than well, they may be back in ten days' time.  Said the\nchaplain:  There be longer whiles of waiting in most men's lives.\nYea, she said, but this is the delay at the best; it may be far\nlonger; for how may we tell what haps may be?\n\nYea, said Leonard, shall we then call it twenty days, or thirty?\nForsooth, that may be long for thee; though there be some who must\nneeds endure hope deferred a deal longer.  But it may run out longer\nthan even thirty days, thy waiting-tide.\n\nShe answered not, and he said:  Whenso the time hangs heavy on hand\nwith thee, if thou hast will to fare abroad out of the castle, I\nshall be ever at hand to guide thee.  Indeed, I wot that the\ncastellan will be loth to let thee go; but he is old and straitlaced:\nand yet withal he wotteth, as do we all, that there is now little\nperil or none were we to fare a five miles or more, whereas we are as\ngood as at peace for the last five days with all save the Red Knight,\nand of him we wot that he is gone into another land with as many of\nhis folk as be not needed for the warding of his hold.\n\nI thank thee, said Birdalone, but it is like to be my will not to\nfare out-a-gates till the Champions come back home.  I was glad e'en\nnow when the castellan fetched me in again:  to say sooth, fear of\nperil had just entered my heart when he came up with me.\n\nThe priest seemed somewhat chapfallen at her answer.  He spake little\nmore, and presently he stood up, made his obeisance, and departed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  BIRDALONE LEARNETH LORE OF THE PRIEST.  TEN DAYS OF\nWAITING WEAR\n\n\n\nWore that day and the next, and Birdalone fell to talking with her\nwomen, whereof were five now left; and four of them were young, the\neldest scarce of thirty summers, and the fifth was a woman of sixty,\nboth wise and kind.  All these told her somewhat of their own lives\nwhen she asked them; and some withal told of folk whom they had known\nor heard tell of.  And well pleased was Birdalone to hear thereof,\nand learn more of the ways of the world, and quick-witted she was at\nthe lesson, so that she needed not to ask many questions.\n\nFurthermore, she took to her broidering again, and fell to doing a\ngoodly pair of shoon for Atra, since she had worn those borrowed ones\nsomewhat hardly.  And the women wondered at her needlework, so\nmarvellous fine as it was, and how that in little space of time were\ncome flowers and trees, and birds and beasts, all lovely; and they\nsaid that the faery must have learned her that craft.  But she\nlaughed and reddened, and thought of the wood-mother; and, sitting\nthere within the four walls, she longed for the oak-glades, and the\nwood-lawns, and for the sight of the beasts that dwelt therein.\n\nAgain she fell in with Leonard the priest, and he asked her could she\nread in a book, and when she said nay, he offered to teach her that\nlore, and she yeasaid that joyously; and thenceforth would she have\nhim with her every day a good while; and an apt scholar she was, and\nhe no ill master, and she learned her A B C speedily.\n\nNow it was the ninth day since the Champions were gone, and all that\ntime she had not been out-a-gates; and after the first two days, had\nenforced herself to fill up her time with her work as aforesaid:  but\nthis last day she might do but little, for she could not but take it\nfor sure that the morrow would be the day of return; nay, even she\ndeemed that they might come in the night-tide; so that when she went\nto bed, though she was weary, she would wake if she might, so that it\nwas nigh dawn ere she fell asleep.\n\nSome three hours after she woke up, and heard a sound of folk\nstirring in the house, and the clashing of weapons; and the heart\nleapt in her, and she said:  They are come, they are come!\nNevertheless she durst not get out of bed, lest her hope had beguiled\nher; and she lay awake another hour, and no tidings came to her; and\nthen she wept herself to sleep; and when she awoke once more, she\nfound that she must have wept sleeping, for the pillow beside her\nface was all wet with the tears.\n\nThe sun was high now, and his beams were cast back from the ripple of\nthe lake, and shone wavering on the wall of the chamber, the window\nwhereof gave on to the water.  Then came a hand on the latch of the\ndoor, and she started, and her heart grieved her; but it was one of\nthe women who opened, and came in, and Birdalone rose up sitting in\nher bed, and said faintly, for she could scarce speak:  Is any tiding\ntoward, Catherine?  The maid said:  Yes, my lady; for early after\nsunrise came weaponed men to the gate, and would sell us beeves; and\nmy lord, Sir Aymeris, must needs go forth and chaffer with them,\nthough belike they had been lifting what was neither ours, nor\ntheirs, nor the neighbours'.  Maybe Sir Aymeris looked to buy tidings\nfrom them as well as beef.  Anyhow they departed when they had gotten\ntheir money and drunk a cup.  And now it is said that the Red Knight\nhath been hurt in some fray, and keepeth his bed; wherefore the land\nshall have peace of him awhile.  Said Birdalone:  I thank thee, good\nCatherine; I shall lie a little longer; depart now.\n\nThe woman went her ways; and when she was gone, Birdalone wept and\nsobbed, and writhed upon her bed, and found no solace to her grief.\nBut she arose and paced the chamber, and sithence looked out of the\nwindow over the empty water, and wept again.  Then she said:  Yet\nthey may come ere noon, or it may be ere evening, or perchance to-\nmorrow morning.  And she stayed her weeping, and was calmer.  But\nstill she walked the floor, and whiles looked out of window, and\nwhiles she looked on her limbs, and felt the sleekness of her sides,\nand she said:  O my body! how thou longest!\n\nBut at last she clad herself in haste, and went stealthily from the\nchamber, as if she feared to meet anyone; and she stole up to the\ntower-top that was nighest, and looked through the door on to the\nleads, and saw no one there; so she went out, and stood by the\nbattlement, and gazed long over the water, but saw neither boat nor\nburning mountain coming towards her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  NOW WOULD BIRDALONE RIDE ABROAD\n\n\n\nAfter a while she came down again, and went to the women, and sat\nworking with them a while, and so wore away two hours.  Then she sent\nfor the priest and had her lesson of him; and when she had been at it\nanother two hours, she bade him begin and learn her writing; and\nnought loth he was thereto; forsooth he had been longing to pray her\nto suffer him learn her, but durst not.  For in such teaching needs\nmust he sit full nigh to her, and watch her hands, and her fingers\nstriving to shape the letters; nay, whiles must he touch her hand\nwith his, and hold it.  Wherefore now he promised himself a taste of\nParadise.  Withal he was full meet to learn her, whereas he was one\nof the best of scribes, and a fair-writer full handy.\n\nSo they fell to the lesson, and she became eager thereover, and\nlearned fast, and clave to the work, while his soul was tormented\nwith longing for her.  And thus wore a three hours, and then suddenly\nshe looked up wearily from her work, and her trouble was awake, and\nthe longing for her speech-friend, and she gave the priest leave for\nthat day, but suffered him to kiss her hand for wages.\n\nThen she hurried up to the tower-top, when the afternoon was wearing\ninto evening; and abode there a long while looking over the waters,\ntill it began to dusk, and then came down miserably and went to her\nwomen.\n\nThe next day was like unto this; nought betid, and she wore the hours\nwhiles going up to the tower-top and looking over the lake, whiles\nbroidering amidst her maids, whiles learning her clerk's work with\nSir Leonard, but ever eating her heart out with her longing.\n\nOn the third of these days she called the castellan to her for a\ntalk, and asked him what he thought of it, this delay of his lords'\nreturn.  Quoth the greyhead:  My lady, we may not wonder if they be\ntarried for a few days; for this is an adventure on which they have\ngone, and many haps betide in such tales.  Now I beseech thee torment\nnot thyself; for the time is not yet come for thee even to doubt that\nthey have miscarried.\n\nHis words solaced her much for that time, whereas she saw that he\nspake but the sooth; so she thanked him, and smiled upon him kindly;\nand he was ravished thereat, and was for kneeling before her at once\nand kissing her hands after his wont; but she smiled again and\nrefrained him, and said:  Nay, not yet, fair friend; that is for the\ndeparture, and I have yet a word to say unto thee:  to wit, that I\nlong to go out-a-gates, and it will solace me and give me patience to\nabide the coming of my friends.  For thou must know, Sir Aymeris,\nthat I was reared amidst the woods and the meadows, with the burning\nof the sun, and the buffets of the wind; and now for lack of some\ndeal of that am I waxing white and faint.  And thou wouldst not have\nme falling sick on thine hands now, wouldst thou?\n\nNay, surely, lady, said Sir Aymeris; this very day I will ride out\nwith thee; and two score or more of weaponed men shall ride with us\nfor fear of mishaps.  Said Birdalone, knitting her brows:  Nay,\nknight, I need not thy men-at-arms; I would fain go free and alone.\nFor hast thou not heard how that the Red Knight is hurt and keepeth\nhis bed?  So what peril is there?  Said Sir Aymeris:  Yea, lady; but\nthe Red Knight is not the only foe, though he be the worst:  but it\nmay well be that the story is but feigned, for the said enemy hath\nmany wiles.  And look you, kind lady, it is most like that by now he\nhath heard how in my poor castle is kept a jewel, a pearl of great\nprice, that hath not its like in the world, and will encompass the\nstealing of it if he may.\n\nLaughed Birdalone, and said:  But how if the said jewel hath a will,\nand legs and feet thereto, and is ready to take the peril on her, and\nwill wend out-a-gates if she will?  What wilt thou do then, lord?\nThen, said the castellan, I shall fetch thee back, and, though it be\na grief to me, shall have thee borne back perforce if nought else may\ndo.  For so the oath sworn to my lords compelleth me.\n\nAgain laughed Birdalone, and said:  Hearken, whereto cometh all this\nkneeling and hand-kissing!  But bear in mind, fair lord, how once on\na time thou wouldst have me out-a-gates, would I, would I not, and\nnow, will I, will I not, thou wouldst keep me within; so have times\nchanged, and mayhappen they may change yet again.  But tell me, am I\nmistress over my women to bid them what I will?  Certes, said he, and\nover all of us.  Said she:  If then I bade them, some two or three,\ncome with me into the meadows and woods a half day's journey for our\ndisport, how then?  For that once, said Sir Aymeris, I should bid\nthem disobey their lady.  Said Birdalone:  And how if they disobeyed\nthee, and obeyed me?  Quoth Sir Aymeris:  If they bring thee back\nsafe, they may chance to sing to the twiggen fiddle-bow, that they\nmay be warned from such folly; but if they come back without thee, by\nAll-hallows the wind of wrath shall sweep their heads off them!\n\nBirdalone flushed red at his word, and was silent a while; then she\nsaid, making cheerful countenance again:  Thou art a hard master,\nlord castellan; but I must needs obey thee.  Therefore I will take\nthy bidding, and ride abroad in such wise that I shall scare the land\nwith an army, since no otherwise may I look on the summer land.  But\nto-day I will not go, nor to-morrow belike; but some day soon.  And\nin good sooth I thank thee for thy heedful care of me, and wish I\nwere better worth it.  Nay, nay, thou shalt not kneel to me, but I to\nthee:  for thou art verily the master.\n\nTherewith she rose from beside him, and knelt down before him and\ntook his hand and kissed it, and went her ways, leaving him ravished\nwith love of her.  But now she had no scorn of him, but deemed, as\nwas true, that he was both valiant and trusty and kind, and she\nthanked him in her heart as well as in words.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  OF BIRDALONE'S FARING ABROAD\n\n\n\nIndeed Birdalone longed on any terms to be out-a-gates and to have\nsome joy of the summer; for now she began to see that she might have\nto abide some while ere her friends should come to her in the Castle\nof the Quest; and she was angry with herself that her longing was\nthus wasting her, and she rebuked herself and said:  Where is now\nthat Birdalone who let but few days go by without some joyance of the\nearth and its creatures? she who bore lightly the toil of a thrall,\nand gibes and mocking and stripes?  Surely this is grievous folly,\nthat I should be worsened since I have come to be the friend of\ngentle ladies, and noble champions, and mighty warriors.  Had it not\nbeen better to have abided under the witch-wife's hand?  For not\nevery day nor most days did she torment me.  But now for many days\nthere has been pain and grief and heart-sickness hour by hour; and\nevery hour have I dreaded the coming of the next hour, till I know\nnot how to bear it.\n\nSo she strove with herself, and became of better heart, and set\nherself strongly to the learning of the clerkly lore; she gathered\nher wits together, and no longer looked for every day and every hour\nto bring about the return of the Champions, nor blamed the day and\nthe hour because they failed therein, and in all wise she strove to\nget through the day unworn by vain longing.\n\nWherefore, on a day when three whole weeks were gone since the day of\ndeparture, she was glad when the castellan came to her and said:\nLady, these two days I have had men out to spy the land, and their\nword goes that nought is stirring which a score of us well-armed\nmight have cause to fear; wherefore to-morrow, if it be thy will, we\nshall bring thee out-a-gates, and so please thee, shall be in no\nhaste to come back, but may lie out in the wildwood one night, and\ncome back at our leisure on the morrow of to-morrow.  How sayest thou\nof thy pleasure herein?\n\nShe thanked him, and yeasaid it eagerly, and next morning they set\nforth; and Birdalone had with her three of the women, and they had\nsumpter-beasts with them, and tents for Birdalone and her maids.\n\nSo they rode by pleasant ways and fair meadows, and the weather was\ngood, for it was now the first days of July, and all was as lovely as\nmight be; and for that while Birdalone cast off all her cares, and\nwas merry, and of many words and sweet; and all the folk rejoiced\nthereat, for all loved her in the Castle of the Quest, besides those\none or two that loved her overmuch.\n\nRode they thus a twelve miles or more, and then they came, as their\npurpose was, to the beginning of a woodland plenteous of venison, and\nthey hunted here, and Birdalone took her part therein, and all\npraised her woodcraft; albeit because of her went a head or two free\nthat had fallen else, whereas of the carle hunters were some who\ndeemed the body of her better worth looking on than the quarry.\n\nHowsoever, they slew of hind and roe and other wood-cattle what they\nwould, some deal for their supper in the wilderness, some to bear\nhome to the castle.  But when night was nigh at hand they made stay\nin a fair wood-lawn about which ran a clear stream, whereby they\npitched the ladies' tent; and Birdalone and hers went down into the\nwater and washed the weariness off them; and her ladies wondered at\nthe deftness of Birdalone's swimming; for they bathed in a pool\nsomewhat great into which the stream widened, so that there was space\nenough for her therein.\n\nBy then they were washen and clad goodly in raiment which they had\nbrought on the sumpters, the men had lighted fires and were cooking\nthe venison, and anon there was supper and banquet in the wildwood,\nwith drinking of wine and pleasant talk and the telling of tales and\nsinging of minstrelsy; and so at last, when night was well worn, and\nout in the open meadows the eastern sky was waxing grey, then\nBirdalone and her ladies went to bed in their fair tents, and the\nmen-at-arms lay down on the greensward under the bare heaven.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  SIR AYMERIS SHOWETH BIRDALONE THE MOUNTAINS AFAR OFF\n\n\n\nWhen it was morning and they arose, the day was as fair as yesterday,\nand folk were even as joyous as they had been then, all but\nBirdalone, and she was silent and downcast, even when she came forth\nfrom the fresh water into the sweetness of the midsummer wood.  She\nhad dreamed in the night that she was all alone in the Castle of the\nQuest, and that her old mistress came to her from out of the Sending\nBoat to fetch her away, and brought her aboard, and stripped her of\nher rich garments and sat facing her, drawing ugsome grimaces at her;\nand she thought she knew that her friends were all dead and gone, and\nshe had none to pity or defend her.  Then somehow were they two, the\nwitch and she, amidmost of the Isle of Nothing, and the witch drew\nclose anigh her, and was just going to whisper into her ear something\nof measureless horror, when she awoke; and the sun was bright outside\nthe shaded whiteness of her tent; the shadows of the leaves were\ndancing on the ground of it; the morning wind was rustling the tree-\nboughs, and the ripple of the stream was tinkling hard by.  At first\nwas Birdalone joyous that what she had awakened from was but a dream;\nbut presently she felt the burden of her longing, and she said to\nherself that when they came back to the castle they should find\ntidings, and that she should know either that her friends were indeed\ndead, or that they were come back again alive and well.  And then she\nthought within herself, suppose the three Champions and their loves\nwere dead and gone, how would she do with those that were left her,\nas Sir Aymeris, and Leonard the priest, and her women? and her soul\nturned with loathing from a life so empty as that would be; and yet\nshe blamed herself that she was so little friendly to these lesser\nfriends, whom forsooth she loved because of her love for the greater\nones.  So, as abovesaid, she was troubled and silent amongst the joy\nof the others.\n\nThat saw Sir Aymeris the castellan; and when they had broken fast and\nwere getting to horse, he came to her and said:  Lady, the day is yet\nyoung, and if we fetch a compass by a way that I wot of we shall see\nplaces new to thee, and mayhappen somewhat wonderful, and yet come\nhome timely to the castle.  Wilt thou?\n\nBirdalone was still somewhat distraught, but she knew not how to\nnaysay him, though at heart she would liefer have gone back to the\ncastle by the shortest way.  So folk brought her her palfrey, and\nthey rode their ways, the castellan ever by her side.  And by fair\nways indeed they went, and so joyous was all about them, that little\nby little Birdalone's gladness came back to her, and she made the\nmost of it to be as merry of seeming as she might be.\n\nNow they rode fair and softly by thicket and copse and glade of the\nwoodland, following up the stream aforesaid for the more part, till\nat last the trees failed them suddenly, and they came forth on to a\nwide green plain, all unbuilded, so far as their eyes could see, and\nbeyond it the ridges of the hills and blue mountains rising high\nbeyond them.\n\nWhen Birdalone's eyes beheld this new thing, of a sudden all care\nleft her, and she dropped her rein, and smote her palms together, and\ncried out:  Oh! but thou art beautiful, O earth, thou art beautiful!\nThen she sat gazing on it, while the greyhead turned and smiled on\nher, well pleased of her pleasure.\n\nAfter a while she said:  And might we go nigher?  Yea, certes, said\nhe, yet I doubt if thou wilt like it the better, the nigher thou art.\nAh! she said, but if I were only amidst it, and a part of it, as once\nI was of the woodland!\n\nSo thitherward they rode over the unharvested mead, and saw hart and\nhind thereon, and wild kine, and of smaller deer great plenty, but of\ntame beasts none; and the hills were before them like a wall.  But as\nthey drew nigher, they saw where the said wall of the hills was\ncloven by a valley narrow and steep-sided, that went right athwart\nthe lie of the hills; the said valley was but little grassed, and the\nbare rocks were crow-black.  When they had gone a little further,\nthey could see that the ground near the foot of the hills rose in\nlittle knolls and ridges, but these were lower and fewer about the\nentry into that valley.  Also presently they came upon a stream which\nran out of the said valley, and Sir Aymeris said that this was the\nwater whereby they had lain last night; albeit here it was little\nindeed.\n\nNow when they had ridden some five miles over the plain, they came\namongst those knolls at the mouth of the valley, and Sir Aymeris led\nBirdalone up to the top of one of the highest of them, and thence\nthey could look into that dale and see how it winded away up toward\nthe mountains, like to a dismal street; for not only was it but\nlittle grassed, but withal there was neither tree nor bush therein.\nMoreover, scattered all about the bottom of the dale were great\nstones, which looked as if they had once been set in some kind of\norder; and that the more whereas they were not black like the rocks\nof the dale-side, but pale grey of hue, so that they looked even as\nhuge sheep of the giants feeding down the dale.\n\nThen spake Birdalone:  Verily, sir knight, thou saidst but sooth that\nI should see things new and strange.  But shall we go a little way\ninto this valley to-day?  Nay, lady, said Sir Aymeris, nor to-morrow,\nnor any day uncompelled; neither shall we go nigher unto it than now\nwe be.  Wherefore not? said Birdalone, for meseemeth it is as the\ngate of the mountains; and fain were I in the mountains.\n\nLady, said the castellan, overmuch perilous it were to ride the\nvalley, which, as thou sayest, is the very gate of the mountains.\nFor the said dale, which hight the Black Valley of the Greywethers,\nhath a bad name for the haunting of unmanlike wights, against which\neven our men-at-arms might make no defence.  And if any might escape\nthem, and win through the gates and up into the mountains, I wot not\nif suchlike devils and things unkent be there in the mountain-land,\nbut of a sooth there be fierce and wild men, like enough to devils,\nwho know no peace, and slay whatsoever cometh unto them, but if they\nthemselves be slain of them.\n\nWell, said Birdalone, then to-day, at least, we go not into the dale;\nbut knowest thou any tales of these wild places?  Many have I heard,\nsaid he, but I am an ill minstrel and should spoil them in the\ntelling.  Ask them of Sir Leonard our priest, he knoweth of them\nbetter than others, and hath a tongue duly shapen for telling them.\n\nBirdalone answered nought thereto; she but turned her horse's head\nand rode down the knoll; and so they came unto their company, and all\nwent their ways toward the Castle of the Quest.\n\nNought befell them on their way home; but the nigher they came to the\ncastle the more pensive waxed Birdalone, and, though she hid it, when\nthey were come to the gate she scarce had her wit; for it was as if\nshe thought to have one rushing out and crying:  Tidings, tidings!\nthey are come.\n\nNowise it so befell; they were no more come than was the Day of Doom.\nAnd a little after they were within gates; it was night, and\nBirdalone crept wearily up to her chamber, and gat to bed, and so\ntired was she that she fell asleep at once and dreamed not.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.  BIRDALONE HEARETH TELL TALES OF THE BLACK VALLEY OF THE\nGREYWETHERS\n\n\n\nOn the morrow was Birdalone heavier of heart than ever yet, and\nwearier for tidings; and she wondered how she could have been so\njoyous that day in the wildwood.  Yet she thought much of the Valley\nof the Greywethers, and that solaced her somewhat after a while, so\nsore she longed to go thither; and, as 'tis said, one nail knocks out\nthe other.  So that morning, when she had had her lesson of priest\nLeonard, she spake thereof to him, and told him what Sir Aymeris had\nsaid concerning his knowledge thereof; and she asked him what he\nknew.\n\nI have been there, said he.  She started at that word and said:  Did\naught of evil befall thee?\n\nNay, said he, but a great fear and dread hung about me; and 'tis said\nthat they try their luck overmuch who go thither twice.\n\nBirdalone said:  Tell me now of the tales that be told of that\nvalley.  Quoth Leonard:  They be many; but the main of them is this:\nthat those Greywethers be giants of yore agone, or landwights,\ncarles, and queans, who have been turned into stone by I wot not what\ndeed; but that whiles they come alive again, and can walk and talk as\nerst they did; and that if any man may be so bold as to abide the\ntime of their awakening, and in the first moment of their change may\nframe words that crave the fulfilment of his desire, and if therewith\nhe be both wise and constant, then shall he have his desire fulfilled\nof these wights, and bear his life back again from out the dale.  And\nthus must he speak and no otherwise:  O Earth, thou and thy first\nchildren, I crave of you such and such a thing, whatsoever it may be.\nAnd if he speak more than this, then is he undone.  He shall answer\nno question of them; and if they threaten him he shall not pray them\nmercy, nor quail before their uplifted weapons; nor, to be short,\nshall he heed them more than if they still were stones unchanged.\nMoreover, when he hath said his say, then shall these wights throng\nabout him and offer him gold and gems, and all the wealth of the\nearth; and if that be not enough, they shall bring him the goodliest\nof women, with nought lacking in her shape, but lacking all raiment,\nso that he shall see her as she is verily shapen.  But whoso shall\ntake any one of all these gifts is lost for ever, and shall become\none of that Stony People; and whoso naysayeth them all until the cock\ncrow, and abideth steady by his one craving, shall win fulfilment\nthereof, and, as some say, all those gifts aforesaid; for that the\nStony People may not abide the day to take them back again.\n\nHe was silent therewith, and nought spake Birdalone, but looked down\non the ground, and longing encompassed her soul.  Then the priest\nspake again:  This were a fair adventure, lady, for a hapless one,\nbut for the happy it were a fool's errand.  She answered not, and\nthey parted for that time.\n\nBut the next week, there being yet no tidings come to hand, Birdalone\nprayed the castellan to take her out-a-gates again, that she might\nonce more behold the mountains, and the gates thereof; and he yeasaid\nher asking, and went with her, well accompanied, as before; but this\ntime, by Birdalone's will, they rode straight to the plain aforesaid,\nand again she looked into that dale of the Greywethers from the\nknoll.  Somewhat belated they were, so that they might not get back\nto the castle before dusk, wherefore again they lay out in the\nwildwood, but there lacked somewhat of the triumph and joyance which\nthey had had that other day.  They came back to the castle on the\nmorrow somewhat after noon, and found no news there; nor, to say\nsooth, did Birdalone look for any; and her heart was heavy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.  BIRDALONE BEGUILETH THE PRIEST TO HELP HER TO OUTGOING\n\n\n\nNow had the time so worn that the season was in the first days of\nAugust, and weariness and heartsickness increased on Birdalone again,\nand she began to look pined and pale.  Yet when she spake of the\ntarrying of the Champions both to the castellan and Sir Leonard the\npriest (who was the wiser man of the two), each said the same thing,\nto wit, that it was no marvel if they were not yet come, seeing\nwhatlike the adventure was; and neither of those two seemed in\nanywise to have lost hope.\n\nThrice in these last days did Birdalone go out-a-gates with Sir\nAymeris and his company; and the last of the three times the journey\nwas to the knoll that looked into the Black Valley; but now was\nBirdalone's pleasure of the sight of it afar off marred by her\nlonging to be amidst thereof; yet she did not show that she was irked\nby the refraining of her desire to enter therein, and they turned,\nand came home safely to the castle.\n\nOn the morrow she sat with Sir Leonard the priest over the writing\nlesson, and she let it be long, and oft he touched her hand, so that\nthe sweetness of unfulfilled desire went deep to his heart.\n\nAt last Birdalone looked up and said:  Friend, I would ask thee if\nthou seest any peril in my entering the Black Valley of the\nGreywethers by daylight if I leave it by daylight?  Alone? quoth he.\nYea, she said, alone.  He pondered a little, and then said:  Sooth to\nsay I deem the peril little in the valley itself, if thou be not\novercome by terror there.  Yea, for my part I am not all so sure that\nthou shalt see the wonder of the Stony Folk coming alive; for 'tis\nnot said that they quicken save on certain nights, and chiefly on\nMidsummer Night; unless it be that the trier of the adventure is some\none fated above others thereto; as forsooth thou mayst be.  And as\nfor peril of evil men, there are few who be like to be as venturesome\nas thou or I.  They durst not enter that black street, save sore need\ncompel them.  But forsooth, going thither, and coming back again,\nsome peril there may be therein.  And yet for weeks past there has\nbeen no word of any unpeace; and the Red Knight it is said for\ncertain is not riding.\n\nBirdalone was silent a while; then she said:  Fair and kind friend, I\nam eating my heart out in longing for the coming back of my friends,\nand it is like, that unless I take to some remedy, I shall fall sick\nthereby, and then when they come back there shall be in me but sorry\ncheer for them.  Now the remedy I know, and it is that I betake me\nalone to this adventure of the Black Valley; for meseemeth that I\nshall gain health and strength by my going thither.  Wherefore, to be\nshort, if thou wilt help me, I will go to-morrow.  What sayest thou,\nwilt thou help me?\n\nHe turned very red and spake:  Lady, why shouldest thou go, as thy\nname is, birdalone?  Thou hast called me just now thy kind friend, so\nkind as it was of thee; now therefore why should not thy friend go\nwith thee?\n\nKindly indeed she smiled on him, but shook her head:  I call thee\ntrusty and dear friend again, said she; but what I would do I must do\nmyself.  Moreover to what end shouldst thou go?  If I fall in with\nghosts, a score of men would help me nought; and if I happen on\nweaponed men who would do me scathe, of what avail were one man\nagainst them?  And look thou, Sir Leonard, there is this avail in\nthine abiding behind; if I come not back in two days' space, or three\nat the most, thou wilt wot that I have fared amiss, and then mayst\nthou let it be known whither I went, and men will seek me and deliver\nme maybe.\n\nTherewith she stayed her words suddenly, and turned very pale, and\nlaid her hand on her bosom, and said faintly:  But O my heart, my\nheart!  If they should come while I am away!  And she seemed like to\nswoon.\n\nLeonard was afraid thereat, and knew not what to do; but presently\nthe colour came into her face again, and in a little while she\nsmiled, and said:  Seest thou not, friend, how weak I am gotten to\nbe, and that I must now beyond doubt have the remedy?  Wilt thou not\nhelp me do it?\n\nYea verily, said he; but in what wise wilt thou have it?  He spake as\na man distraught and redeless; but she smiled on him pleasantly, and\nsaid:  Now by this time shouldst thou have devised what was to do,\nand spared me the pain thereof.  Two things I need of thee:  the\nfirst and most, to be put out of the castle privily betimes in the\nmorning when nought is stirring; the second, to have my palfrey\nawaiting me somewhat anigh the gate, so that I may not have to go\nafoot:  for I am become soft and feeble with all this house-life.\n\nLeonard seemed to wake up with that word, and said:  I have the key\nof the priest's door of the chapel, and the postern beyond it; that\nshall be thine out-gate, lady.  I will come and scratch at thy\nchamber-door much betimes, and I will see to it that thy palfrey is\nbestowed in the bower wherein thou didst rest the first night thou\ncamest amongst us.  She said:  I trust thee, friend.  And she thanked\nhim sweetly, and then rose up and fell to pacing the hall up and\ndown.  Leonard hung about watching her a while, she nought forbidding\nhim, for her thoughts were elsewhere, and she had forgotten him; and\nat last he went his ways to set about doing what she would.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.  BIRDALONE FARES ON HER ADVENTURE\n\n\n\nDawn was but just beginning when Birdalone awoke, and though she had\nnot heard Leonard at the door, she sprang out of bed and clad\nherself, doing on her black gown; and she had a scrip with some bread\ntherein, and a sharp knife at her girdle.  Then even as she had done\nshe heard the priest's nail on the door, and she turned thereto; but\nas she went, her eye caught her bow and quiver of arrows where they\nhung on the wall, so she took the bow in her hand and slung the\nquiver over her shoulder ere she opened the door and found Leonard\nstanding there.  Neither of them spake aught, but they stole\ndownstairs, and so to the chapel and out by the priest's door and the\npostern in the wall-nook, and were presently out in the fresh morning\nair; and Birdalone was joyous and lightfoot, and scarce felt the\nearth beneath her soles for pleasure of her hope, whereas she deemed\nshe had a thing to crave of the Stony Folk, if they should come alive\nbefore her.  Fain were she, if she might withal, to give a joy to\nsome other; so that when they were gone but a little way from the\ncastle she reached out her hand to Leonard and took his, and said:\nHand in hand we walked when first I went this way, and I deemed thee\nkind and friendly then, and even so hast thou been sithence.\n\nHe was dumbfoundered at first for joy of the touch of her hand and\nthe sweetness of her words; but presently he spake to her confused\nand stammering, and praised her that she had thought to take her bow\nand arrows; for, said he, that they might stand her in stead for\ndefence or for getting of food, or for an excuse for wending the\nwoods.  She nodded yeasay unto him, and bade him again to bide three\ndays for her, and if she came not again in that time, to make a clean\nbreast of it to Sir Aymeris.\n\nYea, said the priest, and then . . .  Why, what then?  He can but\nshove me out by the shoulders, and then I can seek to the little\nhouse of canons that is at Gate Cross on the road to Greenford.\n\nAh, my friend! said Birdalone, how we women think of nothing at all\nbut ourselves!  And wilt thou be thrust out of thine home for helping\nme herein?  Why did I not look to my palfrey myself?  And the keys I\nmight have stolen from thee, always with thy good will.  But now I\nsee that I have done thee a hurt.\n\nSaid Sir Leonard:  Lady, a priest hath a home wheresoever is an house\nof religion.  There is no harm done, save Sir Aymeris bethink him of\nhanging me over the battlements; as I doubt he will not with a\npriest.  Moreover, I pray thee believe, that wert thou gone from the\ncastle, house and home were none for me there.  And he looked upon\nher piteously, as if he were beseeching.\n\nBut she knew not what to say, and hung her head adown; and presently\nthey were come to the bower in the copse, which this time was a\nstable for Birdalone's palfrey instead of a chamber for herself.  So\nLeonard went in and fetched out the comely beast; and Birdalone stood\nwith him just in the cover of the copse waiting to put her foot in\nthe stirrup; but she might not but abide to look upon the priest, who\nstood there as if he were striving with his words.\n\nSo she said:  Now is need of haste to be gone.  Yet one word, my\nfriend:  Is there aught betwixt us wherein I have done thee wrong?\nIf so it be, I pray thee to say out what it is; for it may be (though\nI think it not) thou shalt not see me again from henceforth.\n\nHe caught his breath, as if he had much ado to refrain the sobbing;\nbut he mastered it, and said:  Lady and dear friend, if I see thee\nnot again, I heed not what shall befall me.  Thou hast done me no\nwrong.  There is this only betwixt us, that I love thee, and thou\nlovest not me.\n\nShe looked on him sweetly and pitifully, and said:  I may not choose\nbut understand thy word, to wit, that thy love for me is the desire\nof a man toward a woman; and that is unhappy; for I love thee indeed,\nbut not as a woman loveth a man.  It is best to say thus much to thee\ndownright.  But I feel in my heart that when I have said it, it is as\nmuch as to say that I cannot help thee, and therefore am I sorry\nindeed.\n\nHe stood before her abashed, but he said at last:  Now art thou so\nsweet, and so kind, and so true, that I must perforce love thee yet\nmore; and this maketh me bold to say that thou mayst help me a\nlittle, or so meseemeth.  How so? said Birdalone.  Quoth he:  If thou\nwouldst suffer me to kiss thy face this once.  She shook her head,\nand spake:  How may it avail thee, when it is for once, and once\nonly, as forsooth it must be?  Yet it is thy choice, not mine, and I\nwill not naysay thee.\n\nAnd therewith she put up her face to him, and he kissed her cheek\nwithout touching her otherwise, and then he kissed her mouth; and she\nknew that he was both timorous and sad, and she was ashamed to look\non him, or to speak to him any more, lest she should behold him\nashamed; so she but said:  Farewell, friend, till to-morrow at least.\n\nAnd therewith her foot was in the stirrup, and anon she sat in the\nsaddle, and her palfrey was ambling briskly on the way she would.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.  BIRDALONE COMES TO THE BLACK VALLEY\n\n\n\nLittle is to tell of Birdalone's journey unto the knoll above the\nBlack Valley of the Greywethers.  It was about noon when she came\nthere, and had met but few folk on the way, and those few were\nhusbandmen, or carlines, or maidens wending afield betimes not far\nfrom the Castle of the Quest.\n\nNow she sat on her horse and looked down into the dale and its stony\npeople once more, and saw nought stirring save three ravens who, not\nfar off, were flapping about from stone to stone of the Greywethers,\nand croaking loud to each other as if some tidings were toward.  She\nwatched their play for a little, and then gat off her horse, and sat\ndown on the grass of the knoll, and drew forth her victual, and ate\nand drank; for she deemed it happier to eat and drink there than in\nthe very jaws of the Black Valley.\n\nSoon was her dinner done, and then she got to her saddle again, and\nrode slowly down to the little stream, and along it toward the valley\nand the gates of the mountains, which she had been fain to pass\nthrough; but now, as had happed with her that morning when she was\nboun for the Sending Boat, somewhat she hung back from the adventure,\nand when she lacked but some five score yards from the very dale\nitself, she lighted down again, and let her way-beast bite the grass,\nwhile she sat down and watched the rippling water.\n\nIn a while she drew off shoon and hosen, and stood in the shallow\nripple, and bathed her hands and face withal, and stooped up-stream\nand drank from the hollow of her hands, and so stepped ashore and was\nwaxen hardier; then she strung her bow and looked to the shafts in\nher quiver, and did on her foot-gear, and mounted once more, and so\nrode a brisk amble right on into the dale, and was soon come amongst\nthe Greywethers; and she saw that they were a many, and that all the\nbottom of the dale was besprinkled with them on either side of the\nstream, and some stood in the very stream itself, the ground whereof\nwas black even as the rest of the valley, although the water ran over\nit as clear as glass.\n\nAs for the dale, now she was fairly within it, she could see but a\nlittle way up it, for it winded much, and at first away from her left\nhand, and the sides of it went up in somewhat steep screes on either\nside, which were topped with mere upright staves and burgs of black\nrock; and these were specially big and outthrusting on the right hand\nof her; and but a furlong ahead of where she was, one of these burgs\nthrust out past the scree and came down sheer into the dale, and\nstraitened it so much that there was but little way save by the\nstream itself, which ran swift indeed, but not deep, even there where\nit was straitened by the sheer rocks.\n\nBut up the dale would she go, whatever was before her; and now she\ntold herself her very purpose, as forsooth she scarce had heretofore;\nto wit, that she would abide in the dale the night over and see what\nshould betide, and if those wights should chance to come alive, then\nshe looked to have valiance enough to face them and crave the\nfulfilment of her desire.\n\nSo she took the water and rode the stream till she was past the said\nsheer rock, and then the valley widened again, and presently was\nwider than it was in the beginning; and here again were the\nGreywethers grown many more and closer together, and, as she deemed,\nwere set in rings round about one very big one, which, forsooth, was\nsomewhat in the shape of a man sitting down with his hands laid on\nhis knees.\n\nBirdalone reined up for a minute, and looked about her, and then went\nup on to the grass, and rode straight to the said big stone, and\nthere lighted down from off her horse again, and stood by the stone\nand pondered.  Presently she deemed that she saw something dark\nmoving just beyond the stone, but if it were so, it was gone in a\ntwinkling; nevertheless she stood affrighted, and stared before her\nlong, and saw no more, but yet for a while durst not move hand nor\nfoot.\n\nAt last her courage came again, and she thought:  Yet how if this\ngreat chieftain be inwardly stirring and will come awake?  Shall I\nsay the word now, lest hereafter it be of no avail?  Therewith she\nstretched out her right hand and laid it on the stone, and spake\naloud:  O Earth, thou and thy first children, I crave of you that he\nmay come back now at once and loving me.  And her voice sounded\nstrange and unkent to her in that solitude, and she rued it that she\nhad spoken.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.  HOW BIRDALONE FELL IN WITH A MAN IN THE BLACK VALLEY OF\nTHE GREYWETHERS\n\n\n\nCame new tidings therewithal; for the moment after she had spoken, a\ntall man drew out from behind the big stone, and stood before her;\nand at first it was in her mind that this was the very chieftain come\nalive for her, and for terror she was like to swoon this time; but he\nspake nought a while, but looked on her eagerly and curiously.\n\nShe came to herself presently, so much that she could see him\nclearly, and was now growing more shamefast than afraid, when she saw\nbeyond doubt that the man was of the sons of Adam; but what with her\nshame that was now, and her fear that had been, she yet had no might\nto move, but stood there pale and trembling like a leaf, and might\nscarce keep her feet.\n\nNow the new-comer bowed before her smiling, and said:  I ask thy\npardon, fair damsel (or indeed I should say fairest damsel), that I\nhave scared thee.  But sooth to say I beheld thee coming riding, and\neven from a little aloof I could see that nought which might befall\ncould ever make it up to me for not seeing thee close at hand and\nhearing thee speak.  Wherefore I hid myself behind the king's stone\nhere; and no harm is done thereby I trow; for now I see that the\ncolour is coming into thy cheeks again, and thy fear is gone.  And as\nfor me, thou hast not fled away from me, as thou wouldst have done\nhad I not hidden and come on thee suddenly; and then thou being\nhorsed and I unhorsed, thou wouldst have escaped me, whereas now thou\nart within reach of my hand.  Then he smiled, and said:  Furthermore,\nthou hast told so little of thy secret to this stony king here, that\nI am little the wiser for thy word, and thou the little more\nbetrayed.  Only this I will say, that if He loveth thee not, He is\nmore of a fool than I be.\n\nHe reached out his hand to hers, but she drew it aback, and grew yet\nmore ashamed, and could find no word for him.  His voice was soft and\nfull, and he spake deftly, but she was not content with it for its\nkindness, as she had been with all the other men whom she had met\nsince she left the House under the Wood, and she durst not trust her\nhand to him.\n\nAs for his aspect, she saw that he was tall and well-knit, and goodly\nof fashion; dark-haired, with long hazel eyes, smooth-cheeked and\nbright-skinned; his nose long, and a little bent over at the end, and\ncoming down close to his lips, which were full and red; his face was\nhairless save for a little lip-beard.  He was so clad, that he had no\nhelm on his head, but a little hat with a broad gold piece in the\nfront thereof; he was girt to a long sword, and had an anlace also in\nhis belt, and Birdalone saw the rings of a fine hauberk at his collar\nand knees; otherwise he was not armed.  Over his hauberk he wore a\nblack surcoat, without device of any kind, and his foot and leg gear\nwere of the same hue; wherefore may we call him the Black Knight.\nSooth to say, for all his soft speech, she feared him and rued the\nmeeting of him.\n\nNow he spake to her again:  I see that thou art wroth with me, lady;\nbut mayhappen it is not so ill that I have happened on thee; for this\ndale hath a bad name for more than one thing, and is scarce meet for\ndamsels to wander in.  But now since thou hast a weaponed man with\nthee, and thou, by All-hallows! not utterly unarmed, thou mayst well\ngo up the valley and see something more thereof.  So come now, mount\nthine horse again, and I will lead him for thee.\n\nNow Birdalone found speech and said:  Knight, for such thou seemest\nto me, I deem now that I have no need to fare further in this dale,\nbut I will get me into the saddle and turn my horse's head outward\nagain, giving thee good day first and thanking thee for thy courtesy.\nAnd therewith she turned to get to her palfrey, but sore trembling\nthe while; but he followed her and said, with brow somewhat knitted:\nNay, lady, I have left my horse somewhat further up, and I must go\nback to fetch him, that we may wend out of the dale together.  For I\nwill not suffer thee to flee from me and fall into the hands of evil\nwights, be they ghosts or living men, and that the less since I have\nheard the speech in thy mouth, as of honey and cream and roses.\nTherefore if thou go out of the dale, I shall go with thee afoot,\nleading thine horse.  And look to it if it be courteous to unhorse a\nknight, who is ready to be thy servant.  Moreover, since thou hast\ncome to this dale of wonder, and mayst leave it safely, pity it were\nthat thou shouldst see nought thereof, for strange is it forsooth,\nand belike thou shalt never seek thither again.  Wherefore I crave of\nthee, once more, to mount thine horse and let me lead thee up the\ndale.\n\nHe spake these last words rather as one giving a command than making\na prayer, and Birdalone feared him now sorely.  Forsooth she had her\nbended bow in hand; but let alone that the knight was over-near to\nher that she might get a shaft out of her quiver and nock it, ere he\nshould run in on her, and let alone also that he was byrnied, she\nscarce deemed that it behoved her to slay or wound the man because\nshe would be quit of him.  Wherefore angrily, and with a flushed\nface, she answered him:  So shall it be then, Sir Knight; or rather\nso must it be, since thou compellest me.\n\nHe laughed and said:  Nay, now thou art angry.  I compel thee not, I\nbut say that it will not do for thee to compel me to leave thee.  Go\nwhich way thou wilt, up the dale, or down it and out of it; it is all\none unto me, so long as I am with thee.  Forsooth, damsel, I have\nsaid harder words to ladies who have done my pleasure and not deemed\nthemselves compelled.\n\nShe paled but answered nought; then she mounted her palfrey, and the\nknight went to her bridle-rein without more words, and so led her on\nup the valley by the easiest way amongst the Greywethers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.  BIRDALONE IS LED UP THE BLACK VALLEY\n\n\n\nAs they went, the knight fell a-talking to Birdalone, and that\nwithout any of the covert jeering which he had used erewhile; and he\nshowed her places in the dale, as caverns under the burgs, and little\neyots in the stream, and certain stones amongst the Greywethers\nwhereof stories ran; and how this and the other one had fared in\ndealings with the land-wights, and how one had perished, and another\nhad been made happy, and so forth.  Withal he told of the mountain-\nfolk, and in especial how they of the plains, when he was scarce more\nthan a boy, had met them in battle in that same dale, and how fierce\nthe fight was; whereas the mountain-men were fighting for a life of\ndesires accomplished, which hitherto had been but a dream unto them;\nand the men of the plain fought for dear life itself, and for all\nthat made it aught save death in life.  Wherefore up and down the\ndale they fought, at first in ordered ranks and then in knots, and\nlastly sword to sword and man to man, till there was no foot of grass\nor black sand there which had not its shower of blood; and the stream\nwas choked with the dead, and ran red out of the dale; till at last\nwell-nigh all the host of the mountain-men was fallen, and scarce\nless of the folk of the plains, but these men held the field and had\nthe victory.\n\nAll this he told her deftly and well, and though he said not so right\nout, yet let her wot that, youth as he was, he was of the battle; and\nhis voice was clear and good, and Birdalone's wrath ran off her, and\nshe hearkened his tale, and even asked him a question here and there;\nand so courteous was this Black Knight now become, that Birdalone\nbegan to think that she had fallen short of courtesy to him, because\nof her fear and the weariness of the waiting which so oppressed her;\nand that shamed and irked her, for she would fain be of all courtesy.\nWherefore now she deemed that perchance she had erred in deeming him\nan evil man; and she looked on him from time to time, and deemed him\ngoodly of fashion; she thought his eyes were deep, and his face sober\nand fair of aspect, but that his nose turned down at the end, and was\nover thin at the bridge, and moreover his lips looked over-sweet and\nlicorous.\n\nNow when the knight was silent of his tales, Birdalone fell to asking\nhim questions sweetly concerning this Stony People which was all\nabout them; and he told her all he knew, soberly enough at first, yet\nindeed ended by mocking them somewhat, but mocked not at her any\nmore.  At last he said:  Fair lady, that thou hast not come here all\nfor nought I partly know by those words which I heard come from thy\nmouth at the King's Stone; wherefore I marvelled indeed when I heard\nthee say that thou wouldst go straight out of the dale; for I had\ndeemed thee desirous of trying the adventure of waking this Stony\nPeople a-night-tide.  Forsooth was this thy mind when thou soughtest\nhither to the dale?\n\nShe reddened at his word, and yeasaid him shortly.  Then said he:  Is\nit not thy mind still?  Sir, said she, as now I have got to fear it.\nYea? and that is strange, said he, for thou wouldst have waked the\ndale alone; and now thou art no longer alone, but hast me to watch\nand ward thy waking, thou art more afeard.\n\nShe looked on his face steadily, to wot if there were no half-hidden\nsmile therein; but herseemed that he spake in all soberness; and she\nhad nought to say to him save this:  Sir, I am now become afraid of\nthe waking.  And he said no more thereof.\n\nNow they went thus, and Birdalone not without pleasure, since her\nfear of the knight was minished, some three hours up the dale, and\nstill were the Greywethers everywhere about them, so that there were\nwell-nigh as many hours as miles in their wending.\n\nAt last they seemed to be drawing nigh to the head of the dale, and\nthe burgs and the rocks were before them all round it as a wall,\nthough yet about a mile aloof at the further end; and this end it was\nwider than elsewhere.\n\nCame they then to a level space of greensward clear of the grey\nstones, which were drawn all around it in ordered rings, so that it\nwas as some doom-ring of an ancient people; and within the said space\nBirdalone beheld a great black horse tethered and cropping the grass.\nThe knight led her into the ring, and said:  Now are we come home for\nthe present, my lady, and if it please thee to light down we shall\npresently eat and drink, and sithence talk a little.  And he drew\nnigh to help her off her horse, but she suffered him not, and lighted\ndown of herself; but if she suffered not his hand, his eyes she must\nneeds suffer, as he gazed greedily on the trimness of her feet and\nlegs in her sliding from her horse.\n\nHowsoever, he took her hand, and led her to a little mound on the\nother side of the ring, and bade her sit down there, and so did she,\nand from under the nighest of the stones he drew forth a pair of\nsaddle-bags, and took victual and wine thence, and they ate and drank\ntogether like old companions.  And now Birdalone told herself that\nthe knight was frank and friendly; yet forsooth she wotted that her\nheart scarce trowed what it feigned, and that she yet feared him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.  HOW THOSE TWAIN GET THEM FROM OUT OF THE BLACK VALLEY\nOF THE GREYWETHERS\n\n\n\nWhen they had dined, and had sat a while talking, the knight said:  I\nwill ask thee once more wherefore thou must needs depart from this\ndale leaving the Greywethers unwaked?  Yet this must I tell thee\nfirst, that this ring at the dale's end is the only one due place\nwhere the Greywethers can be rightly waked, and that there be few who\nwot this.  Wilt thou not tell me then what is in thy mind?\n\nBirdalone gazed down on the ground a while; then she lifted up her\nhead and looked on the Black Knight, and said:  Sir Knight, we have\nbeen brought so close together to-day, and as meseemeth I am so\nwholly in thy power, that I will tell thee the very truth as it is.\nMy mind it was to wake the dale here to-night, and take what might\nbefall me.  And well indeed might I fear the adventure, which few,\nmeseemeth, would not fear.  But so strong is my longing for that\nwhich I would crave of these wights, that it overmastered my fear,\nand my purpose held when I entered the dale.  Then I met thee; and\nhere again is the truth, take it how thou wilt, that presently I\nfeared thee, and yet I fear thee; for I have noted thee closely all\nthis while, and have seen of thee, that thou art over heedful of my\npoor body, and wouldst have it for thine own if thou mightest.  And\nthere is this in thee also, as I deem, though thou thyself mayst not\nknow it, that thou wouldst have thy pleasure of me whether it\npleasure me or grieve me; and this thy pleasure must I needs gainsay;\nfor though thou mayest hereafter become my friend, yet are there\nother friends of mine, who be such, that my grief would mar any\npleasure they might have.  Hast thou heard and understood?\n\nShe looked on his face steadily as she spake, and saw that it\nflushed, and darkened, and scowled, and that his hands were clenched,\nand his teeth set hard together.  And again she spake:  Sir, thou\nshalt know that beside these shot-weapons, I have a thing here in my\ngirdle that may serve either against thee or against me, if need\ndrive me thereto; wherefore I will pray thee to forbear.  Forsooth,\nthou shalt presently happen on other women, who shall be better unto\nthee than I can be.\n\nBy then Birdalone had spoken the word, the knight's face had cleared,\nand he laughed aloud and said:  As to thy last words, therein at\nleast thou liest, my lady.  But for the rest, I see that it must all\nbe as thou wiliest.  Yea, if such be thy will, we shall presently to\nhorse and ride down the dale again, and at the end thereof I shall\nleave thee to go home alone at thy will.  She said:  For that I can\nthee thanks with all my heart.  But why hast thou not asked me of\nwhence I am, and whither I would go home?\n\nAgain he laughed and said:  Because I know already.  I have had more\nthan two or three tales from them who have seen thee, or spoken unto\nothers who have seen thee, how the gay Champions of the Castle of the\nQuest had fished up a wondrous pearl of price from out of the Great\nWater; and when I set eyes on thy beauty, I knew that the said pearl\ncould be nowhere else than under mine eyes.\n\nLet that pass, she said, and blushed not; but now tell me the truth\nas I have told thee, why thou art so instant with me to wake the\nGreywethers to-night?  He kept silence a while, and, as she looked on\nhim, she thought she saw confusion in his face; but at last he said:\nThou wert wrong in saying that I heeded not thy pleasure, and solace,\nand welfare.  Meseemed, and yet doth, that it might be to thine avail\nto wake the Greywethers to-night; and never again mayst thou have a\nchance of the waking, as erst I said.  I say I wish thee to have\nfulfilment of thy craving.  Nor hast thou aught to fear of them,\nseeing that it is but dastards and fools that they undo.\n\nHe broke off his speech, and Birdalone yet looked on him, and after a\nlittle he said:  Thou drawest the truth out of me; for moreover I\nwould have thee with me longer than thou wouldst be if we but rode\ntogether down the water and out of the dale, and thou to fare away\nalone.\n\nBirdalone spake in a while, and that while he gazed upon her eagerly;\nshe said:  I shall now tell thee that I shall abide the adventure of\nthe waking to-night, whatever befall.  And I, said he, will so do\nthat thou mayst fear me the less; for I will unarm me when the night\ncometh, and thou thyself shalt keep mine hauberk and sword and\nanlace.\n\nShe said:  It is well; I will take that, lest desire overmaster thee.\n\nThey spake no more of it at that time, and it was now five hours\nafter noon.  Birdalone arose, for she found it hard to sit still and\nabide nightfall:  she went without the two first rings of the\nGreywethers, which were set in more open order beyond that, and she\nlooked all about her, to the black rocks on either side, and to the\ngreat black wall at the dale's ending, and the blue mountains aloof\nbeyond it; then down toward the plain of the dale came her eyes, and\nshe looked through the tangle of the grey stones.  Now she seemed to\nbe looking more intently upon some one thing; with that she called to\nher the Black Knight, who was hanging about watching her, and she\nsaid to him:  Fair sir, art thou clear-seeing and far-seeing?  I am\nnot thought to be purblind, quoth he.  Then Birdalone reached out her\nhand and pointed and said:  Canst thou see aught which thou didst not\nlook to see, there, up the dale as I point?  Said he:  All too clear\nI see the hand and the wrist of thee, and that blinds me to aught\nelse.  I pray thee fool not, she said, but look heedfully, and thou\nmayst see what I see, and then tell me what it means.  Though\nforsooth I am exceeding in far sight.\n\nHe looked under the sharp of his hand heedfully, then he turned unto\nher and said:  By All-hallows! there is in thee every excellency!\nThou art right; I see a bay horse up there feeding on the bites of\ngrass amongst the Greywethers.  Look again! she said; what else canst\nthou see?  Is there aught anigh to the bay horse which is like to the\ngleam and glitter of metal.  Christ! said he, once more thou art\nright.  There be weaponed men in the dale.  Tarry not, I beseech\nthee, but get to horse forthright, and I will do no less.\n\nThere goeth the waking of the dale for this time, said Birdalone,\nlaughing.  But art thou not in haste, fair sir? may not these be\nfriends?\n\nThe knight laid his hand upon her shoulder, and thrust her on toward\nher palfrey, and spake fiercely, but not loud:  Thee I pray not to\nfool now!  There is not a minute to spare.  If thou deemest me evil,\nas I think thou dost, there are worser than I, I tell thee, there are\nworser.  But we will talk of it when we be in the saddle, and clear\nof this accursed dale.\n\nBirdalone knew not what to do save obey him, so she lightly gat into\nher saddle, and followed him, for he was mounted in a twinkling, and\nriding on.  He led out of the ring, and fell to threading the maze of\nthe Greywethers, keeping ever toward the steep side of the dale,\nwhich was on that hand that looked toward the Castle of the Quest,\nthat is to say, the eastern bent.  Birdalone wondered at this\nleading, and when she was come up with the knight she spake to him\nbreathlessly, and said:  But, fair sir, why wend we not down the\ndale?  He answered:  First, lady, because we must hide us from them\nstraightway; and next because they be more than we, many more, and\ntheir horses be fresh, while thine at least is somewhat spent; and if\nthey were to spur down the dale in chase, they would soon be upon us;\nfor think not that I would escape and leave thee behind.\n\nSaid Birdalone:  But thou knowest them, then, what they be? since\nthou wottest of their numbers and their riding.  Hearken now!  Upon\nthy soul and thy salvation, be they more friends unto thee than unto\nme?\n\nHe said, as be rode on a little slower than erst:  Upon my soul and\nmy salvation I swear it, that the men yonder be of the worst\nunfriends to thee that may be in the world.  And now, lady, I promise\nthee that I will unravel thee the riddle, and tell thee the whole\ntruth of these haps, whatsoever may come of my words, when we be in a\nsafer place than this; and meantime I beseech thee to trust in me\nthus far, as to believe that I am leading thee out of the very worst\nperil that might befall thee.  Nay, thou must needs trust me; for I\ntell thee, that though I now love thee better than all the world and\nall that is in it, I would slay thee here in this dale rather than\nsuffer thee to fall into the hands of these men.\n\nBirdalone heard him with a sick heart; but such passion went with his\nwords that she believed what he said; and she spake softly:  Sir, I\nwill trust thee thus far; but I beseech thee to have pity upon a poor\nmaiden who hath had but little pity shown unto her until these latter\ndays; and then:  O woe's me, to have fallen out of the kindness and\nlove once more!\n\nThe Black Knight spake to her in a little while, and said:  What pity\nI can to thee, that I will.  Once more I tell thee, that if thou but\nknew it thou wouldst thank me indeed for what I have done for thee in\nthis hour; and henceforth I will do and forbear with thee to the\nuttermost that love will suffer me.  But lo thou! here are we safe\nfor this present; but we must nowise tarry.\n\nBirdalone looked and saw that they were come to the wall of the dale,\nand that there it went down sheer to the plain thereof, and that\nbefore them was a cleft that narrowed speedily, and over which the\nrocks well-nigh met, so that it was indeed almost a cave.  They rode\ninto it straightway, and when that they had gone but a little, and\nbecause it had winded somewhat, they could but see the main valley as\na star of light behind them, then it narrowed no more, but was as a\ndismal street of the straitest, whiles lighter and whiles darker,\naccording as the rocks roofed it in overhead or drew away from it.\nLong they rode, and whiles came trickles of water from out the rocks\non one hand or the other; and now and again they met a stream which\ncovered all the ground of the pass from side to side for the depth of\na foot or more.  Great rocks also were strewn over their path every\nhere and there, so that whiles must they needs dismount and toil\nafoot over the rugged stones; and in most places the way was toilsome\nand difficult.  The knight spake little to Birdalone, save to tell\nher of the way, and warn her where it was perilous; and she, for her\npart, was silent, partly for fear of the strange man, or, it might\nbe, even for hatred of him, who had thus brought her into such sore\ntrouble, and partly for grief.  For, with all torment of sorrow, she\nkept turning over and over in her mind whether her friends had yet\ncome home to the Castle of the Quest, and whether they would go seek\nher to deliver her.  And such shame took hold of her when she thought\nof their grief and confusion of soul when they should come home and\nfind her gone, that she set her mind to asking if it had not been\nbetter had she never met them.  Yet in good sooth her mind would not\nshape the thought, howsoever she bade it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.  NOW THEY REST FOR THE NIGHT IN THE STRAIT PASS\n\n\n\nAt last, when they had been going a long while, it might be some six\nhours, and it had long been night in the world without, but moon-lit,\nand they had rested but seldom, and then but for short whiles, the\nknight drew rein and spake to Birdalone, and asked her was she not\nweary.  O yea, she said; I was at point to pray thee suffer me to get\noff and lie down on the bare rock.  To say sooth, I am now too weary\nto think of any peril, or what thou art, or whither we be going.  He\nsaid:  By my deeming we be now half through this mountain highway,\nand belike there is little peril in our resting; for I think not that\nany one of them knoweth of this pass, or would dare it if he did; and\nthey doubtless came into the dale by the upper pass, which is strait\nenough, but light and open.\n\nAs he spoke, Birdalone bowed forward on her horse's neck, and would\nhave fallen but that he stayed her.  Then he lifted her off her\nhorse, and laid her down in the seemliest place he might find; and\nthe pass there was much widened, and such light as there was in the\nouter world came down freely into it, though it were but of the moon\nand the stars; and the ground was rather sandy than rocky.  So he\ndight Birdalone's bed as well as he might, and did off his surcoat\nand laid it over her; and then stood aloof, and gazed on her; and he\nmuttered:  It is an evil chance; yet the pleasure of it, the pleasure\nof it!  Yea, said he again, she might well be wearied; I myself am\nready to drop, and I am not the least tough of the band.  And\ntherewith he laid him down on the further side of the pass, and fell\nasleep straightway.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.  THE BLACK KNIGHT TELLS THE TRUTH OF HIMSELF\n\n\n\nWhen the morning was come down into the straitness of their secret\nroad, Birdalone opened her eyes and saw the Black Knight busy over\ndighting their horses:  so she arose and thrust her grief back into\nher heart, and gave her fellow-farer the sele of the day, and he\nbrought her victual, and they ate a morsel, and gat to horse\nthereafter and departed; and the way became smoother, and it was\nlighter overhead everywhere now, and the rocks never again met\noverhead athwart the way; and it seemed to Birdalone that now they\nwere wending somewhat downward.\n\nThe knight was courteous unto Birdalone, and no longer for the\npresent thrust his love upon her, so that now she had some solace of\nhis fellowship, though he was but few-spoken to her.\n\nIt was betimes when they arose, and they rode all the morning till it\nwas noon, which they might well wot of, because the way was much\nwider, and the cliff-walls of the pass much lower, so that the sun\nshone in upon them and cheered them.\n\nNow the Black Knight drew rein and said:  Shall we rest, lady, and\neat?  And thereafter, if thou wilt, I shall tell thee my tale.  Or\nrather, if thou wilt suffer me, I shall speak first and eat\nafterwards, or else the morsel might stick in my throat.  Knight,\nsaid Birdalone, smiling, I hope thou hast no lie to swallow down\nbefore the meat.  Nay, lady, said he; no lie that is of moment at\nleast.\n\nSo they lighted down, and Birdalone sat on the wayside under a birch-\nbush that came thrusting out from the rock, and the knight stood\nbefore her, hanging his head, as though he were one accused who would\nplead his cause; and he began:\n\nLady, I must tell thee first of all, that to-day I have done as an\nunfaithful servant and a traitor to my lord.  Said Birdalone simply:\nShall I tell thee the truth, and say that from the first I seemed to\nsee in thee that thou wert scarce trusty?  He said:  Well, that mind\nI saw in thee, and it went to my heart that thou shouldest think it,\nand that it should be no less than true.  But now I must tell thee,\nthat it is for thy sake that I have been untrusty to my lord.  How\nso? said she.  Quoth he:  Heardest thou ever of the Red Knight?  Yea,\nsaid Birdalone, I have heard of him ever as a tyrant and oppressor.\nThen she grew pale, and said:  Art thou he?  Nay, said the knight, I\nam but a kinsman of his, and his best-trusted man; nor have I failed\nhim ever till yesterday.\n\nHe kept silence a while, and then said:  This is the true tale:  that\nwe have had tidings of thee and of thy ridings abroad with that old\nfool, Sir Aymeris, and how thou hadst been twice to look into the\nBlack Valley.  This I say hath the Red One heard, and the heart of\nhim was touched by the mere hearsay of thee; and moreover 'tis\nblessed bread to him the doing of any grief to the knights of Quest\nCastle; wherefore he hath sent me to hang about the dale, to lay\nhands on thee if I might for; he knew being wise, that thou wouldst\nhanker after it; and moreover he let one of his wise women sit out in\nspells on thee.  So I espied, and happened on thee all alone; and\nmine errand it was, since I came upon thee thus, to draw thee till I\nhad thee safe at home in the Red Hold.  Forsooth I began mine errand\nduly, and fell to beguiling thee, so that thou mayst well have seen\nthe traitor in me.  But then, and then my heart failed me, because I\nfell, not to desiring thee as coveting my master's chattel, but to\nloving thee and longing for thee as my fellow and speech-friend.  And\nI said to myself:  Into the Red Hold she shall not go if I may hinder\nit.\n\nBirdalone was very pale, but she refrained her from grief and fear,\nand said:  But those horsed and weaponed men up the dale, who were\nthey?  He said:  I will not lie now, not even a little; they came\ninto the dale by that upper pass whereof I told thee; they were of\nour men; I brought them.  I was never all alone in the dale; I was to\nhave fetched thee to them, so that thou mightest not see a rout of\nfolk and flee away; and then would we all have gone home together by\nthe upper pass.  But we two must have gone on unto them in the dale's\nhead, whereas for all that I could say I might not bring them down\ninto that doom-ring where we ate and talked yesterday.  We two have\nbeen valianter than thou mayst have deemed, to have done the deed of\ndining there; for all men fear it.  But as for me, I have been there\nmore than twice or thrice, and thence have I wandered, and found this\npass wherein now we be; concerning which I have held my tongue,\ndeeming that it might one day serve my turn; as it hath done now\nabundantly, since it hath been a refuge unto thee.\n\nYea, but whither are we going now? said Birdalone; is it perchance to\nthe Red Hold?  Nay, never, said the knight, so help me God and All-\nhallows!\n\nWhither then? said Birdalone; tell me, that I may at least trust\nthee, even though I owe thee for all the pain and grief which thou\nhast wrought me.  He reddened and said:  Wait a while; I bring thee\nto no ill place; there shall no harm befall thee.  And he fretted and\nfumed, and was confused of speech and look, and then he said:  When\nwe come there I shall belike crave a boon of thee.\n\nO, but I crave a boon of thee here and now, said Birdalone.  Wipe\naway thine offence to me and take me back to my friends and the\nCastle of the Quest!  So mayst thou yet be dear unto me, though maybe\nnot wholly as thou wouldst have it.  And she reached out her two\nhands toward him.\n\nHis breast heaved, and he seemed nigh to weeping; but he said:  Nay,\nlady, ask me not here and now, but there and to-morrow.  But again I\nswear to thee by thine hands that to the Red Hold I will not bring\nthee, nor suffer thee to be brought, if I may hinder it; nay, not\nthough I give my life therefor.\n\nBirdalone was silent awhile; then she said:  And what shall befall me\nif I come to the Red Hold?  What is the Red Knight, and what would he\ndo with me?  Said he:  The Red Knight is terrible and fierce and\nwise; and I fear him, I.  He held his peace, and said:  I must needs\nsay it, that to thee he would have been as Death and the Devil.  He\nwould have bedded thee first.  She broke in:  Nay, never! and flushed\nvery red.  But the knight went on:  And after, I wot not; that were\naccording to his mood.  And as to thy never, lady, thou wottest not\nthe like of him or of the folk he hath about him.  Such as thou? she\nsaid angrily.  Nay, he said, far worse than me; men who fare little\nafield, and are not sweetened by adventures and war-perils; and women\nworser yet; and far worser were they dealing with a woman.  She was\nsilent again awhile, and paled once more; then her colour came back\nto her, and she held out her hand to him and said kindly:  Thou being\nwhat thou art, I thank thee for thy dealings with me; and now until\nto-morrow, when I shall ask thee of that again, I am friends with\nthee; so come now, and let us eat and drink together.\n\nHe took her hand and kissed it, and then came and sat down meekly\nbeside her, and they ate and drank in that wild place as though they\nhad been friends of long acquaintance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.  THE BLACK KNIGHT BRINGS BIRDALONE TO THE BOWER IN THE\nDALE\n\n\n\nWhen they had made an end of their meal, they gat to horse again and\nrode on their ways; and every mile now was their road the easier, the\npass wider, and its walls lower and now also more broken; till at\nlast they began to go down hill swiftly, and after a little their\nroad seemed to be swallowed in a great thicket of hornbeam and holly;\nbut the knight rode on and entered the said thicket, and ever found\nsome way amidst the branches, though they were presently in the very\nthick of the trees, and saw no daylight between the trunks for well-\nnigh an hour, whereas the wood was thick and tangled, and they had to\nthread their way betwixt its mazes.\n\nAt last the wood began to grow thinner before them, and the white\nlight to show between the trunks; and Birdalone deemed that she heard\nthe sound of falling water, and presently was sure thereof; and the\nknight spake to her:  Patience, my lady; now are we near home for to-\nday.  She nodded kindly to him, and therewith they rode on to open\nground, and were on the side of a steep bent, broken on their right\nhands into a sheer cliff as Birdalone saw when the knight led her to\nthe edge and bade her look over.  Then she saw down into a fair dale\nlying far below them, through the which ran a little river, clear and\nswift, but not riotous, after it had fallen over a force at the upper\nend of the dale, and made the sound of water which she had heard.\nThe said dale was so, that whatsoever was on the other side thereof\nwas hidden by tall and great trees, that stood close together some\ntwenty yards aloof from the stream, and betwixt them and it was fair\ngreensward with a few bushes and thorn-trees thereon.\n\nQuoth the knight:  Down there shall we rest till to-morrow, if it\nplease thee, lady; and since the sun will set in an hour, we were\nbest on our way at once.  It pleases me well, said Birdalone, and I\nlong to tread the turf by the river-side, for I am weary as weary may\nbe of the saddle and the pass.\n\nSo down the bent they rode, and it was but a little ere they had\nridden it to an end, and had met the river as it swept round the\ncliff-wall of the valley; and they rode through it, and came on to\nthe pleasant greensward aforesaid under the trees; and in a bight of\nthe wood was a bower builded of turf and thatched with reed; and\nthere, by the bidding of the knight, they alighted; and the knight\nsaid:  This is thine house for to-night, my lady; and thou mayest lie\nthere in all safety after thou hast supped, and mayst have my weapons\nby thy side if thou wilt, while I lie under the trees yonder.  And if\nthou wilt bathe thee in the cool water, to comfort thee after the\nlong ride and the weariness, I swear by thy hand that I will take\nmyself out of eye-shot and abide aloof till thou call me.\n\nSaid Birdalone, smiling somewhat:  Fair sir, I will not have my watch\nand ward unarmed; keep thou thy weapons; and thou wilt not forget,\nperchance, that I am not wholly unarmed, whereas I have my bow and\narrows and my knife here.  And as to my bathing, I will take thee at\nthy word, and bid thee go aloof a while now at once; for I will go\ndown to the water; and if thou spy upon me, then will it be thy shame\nand not mine.\n\nThe knight went his ways therewith, and Birdalone went down to the\nwater and unclad her; but ere she stepped into the river, she laid\nher bow and three shafts on the lip thereof.  Then she took the\nwater, and disported her merrily therein; and now, forsooth, she was\nnowise downcast, for she said to herself, this man is not all evil\nand he lovest me well, and I look for it that to-morrow he will bring\nme on my way toward the Castle of the Quest, for mere love of me; and\nthen shall he be a dear friend to me, and I will comfort him what I\ncan for as long as we both live.\n\nSo she came out of the water and clad her, and then called aloud for\nthe knight, and he came speedily unto her, as if he had been not\nexceeding far away, though he swore with a great oath that he had\nnowise espied her.  She answered him nought, and they went side by\nside to the bower; and there the knight dight the victual, and they\nsat together and ate their meat like old friends; and Birdalone asked\nthe knight concerning this valley and the bower, if he had known it\nfor long, and he answered:  Yea, lady, I was but a stripling when I\nfirst happened on the dale; and I deem that few know thereof save me;\nat least none of our flock knoweth thereof, and I am fain thereof,\nand keep them unknowing, for if my lord were to hear of my having a\nhaunt privy unto me he would like it but ill.\n\nBirdalone turned pale when she heard him speak of his lord; for fear\nof the Red Knight had entered into her soul, so that now the flesh\ncrept upon her bones.  But she enforced her to smile, and said:  Yea,\nand what would he do to thee were he ill-content with thy ways?\nForsooth, lady, said he, if he could spare me he would make an end of\nme in some miserable way; nay, if he were exceeding ill-content, he\nwould do as much for me whether he could spare me or not; otherwise\nhe would watch his occasion, and so grieve me that what he did would\ngo to my very heart.  Woe's me! said Birdalone, thou servest an evil\nmaster.  The knight answered not, and Birdalone went on speaking\nearnestly:  It is a shame to thee to follow this fiend; why dost thou\nnot sunder thee from him, and become wholly an honest man?  Said he\ngruffly:  It is of no use talking of this, I may not; to boot, I fear\nhim.  Then did Birdalone hold her peace, and the knight said:  Thou\ndost not know; when I part from thee I must needs go straight to him,\nand then must that befall which will befall.  Speak we no more of\nthese matters.\n\nBirdalone flushed with hope and joy as he spake thus, for she took\nhim to mean that he would lead her, on the morrow, on her way to the\nCastle of the Quest.  But the knight spake in a voice grown cheerful\nagain:  As to this bower, lady, the tale thereof is soon told; for\nwith mine own hands I builded it some fifteen years ago; and I have\ncome to this place time and again when my heart was overmuch\noppressed with black burdens of evil and turmoil, and have whiles\nprevailed against the evil, and whiles not.  Mayst thou prevail this\ntime, then! said she.  He answered her not, but presently fell to\ntalking with her of other matters, and the two were frank and\nfriendly together, till the August night grew dark about them; and\nthen spake Birdalone:  Now would I rest, for I can no longer keep\nmine eyes open.  Abide aloof from me to-morrow morning till I call to\nthee, as thou didst this evening; and then, before we eat together\nagain, thou shalt tell me what thou wilt do with me.  He stood up to\ndepart, and she reached out her hand to him in the glimmer, and he\nsaw it, but said:  Nay, if I take thine hand, I shall take thine\nwhole body.  And therewith he departed, and she laid her down in her\nsmock alone, and slept anon, and was dreamless and forgetting\neverything till the sun was up in the morning.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.  YET A DAY AND A NIGHT THEY TARRY IN THE DALE\n\n\n\nBirdalone awoke when the sun came into the bower to her, and stood up\nat once, and went down to the river and washed the night off her; and\nthen, when she was clad, called on the knight to come to her; and he\ncame, looking downcast and troubled; so that Birdalone thought within\nherself:  It is well, he will do my will.\n\nShe stood before him, and gave him the sele of the day, and he looked\non her sorrowfully.  Then she said:  Now is come the time when I am\nto ask thee to take me back to the Castle of the Quest and my own\npeople.  He was not hasty to answer her, and she spake again:  This\nmust thou do, or else take me to the Red Hold and deliver me to the\ntyrant there; and I have heard it from thine own mouth that will be\nnought else than casting me into shame and torment and death.  And I\ndeem thou canst not do it.  Nay, she said, staying the words that\nwere coming from his mouth, I wot that thou canst do it if thine\nheart can suffer it; for thou art stronger than I, and thou mayst\nbreak my bow, and wrest this knife out of mine hand; and thou canst\nbind me and make me fast to the saddle, and so lead my helpless body\ninto thraldom and death.  But thou hast said that thou lovest me, and\nI believe thee herein.  Therefore I know that thou canst not will to\ndo this.\n\nHe answered in his surly voice:  Thou art right, lady, I cannot.\nNay, hearken thou this time.  I have been turning over night-long\nwhat thou didst say about leaving my lord, that is, betraying him,\nfor it comes to that; and now I have made up my mind to do it, and I\nwill betray him for thy sake.  Wherefore there is a third way to take\nwhich thou hast not seen; we will ride out of this dale in an hour's\ntime, and I will bring thee to them who are only less the mortal foes\nof the Red Knight than are thy fellows of the Quest, to wit, to the\ncaptain and burgesses of the good town of Greenford by the Water; and\nI will do them to wit that I have rescued thee from the hands of the\nRed Knight, and am become his foe; and will show them all his\nincomings and outgoings, and every whit of rede, and entrap him, so\nthat he fall into their hands.  Now, though were I to be taken in\nbattle by them, I should be speedily brought to the halter, or may be\nto the bale-fire (for we be wizards all in the Red Hold); yet with\nthis word in my mouth, if they trow in it, I shall be made their\ncaptain, and presently their master.  Trow in my tale they will, if\nthou bear me out therein, and they will honour thee, and suffer thee\nto give thyself to me in marriage; and then I know thee, and myself\nalso, and that ere long we shall be both mighty and wealthy and\nbeloved, and fair will be the days before us.\n\nHis voice had grown softer as he spake, and toward the end of his\nwords he faltered, and at last brake out a-weeping, and cast himself\nwordless on the grass before her.\n\nShe was pale, and her brow was knitted, and her face quivered; but\nshe spake coldly to him and said:  This way I cannot take; and I\nwonder at thee that thou hast shown it unto me, for thyself thou\nknowest that I cannot go with thee.  I will go nowhere hence save to\nthe Castle of the Quest.  If thou wilt not lead me thereto, or put me\non the road, I ask thee straight, Wilt thou stay me if I go seek the\nway thither myself?\n\nHe rose up from the ground with a pale face full of anger as well as\ngrief, and caught her by the wrists and said, scowling the while:\nTell me now which of them it is; is it the stupid oaf Baudoin, or the\nlight fool Hugh, or the dull pedant Arthur?  But it matters not; for\nI know, and all the country-side knows, that they be vowed, each man\nof them, to his own woman; and if they find not the women themselves,\nsuch dolts they are, that they will ever be worshipping the mere\nshadows of them, and turn away from flesh and blood, were it the\nfairest in the world, as thou art, as thou art.\n\nShe shrank away from him what she might, but he still held her\nwrists; then she spake in a quivering voice, her very lips pale with\nfear and wrath:  It is well seen that thou art a man of the Red\nKnight; and belike thou wouldst do with me as he would.  But one\nthing I crave of thee, if there is any grain of mercy in thee, that\nthou wilt draw thy sword and thrust me through; thou mayst leave\nthine hold of me to get at the blade, I will not stir from where I\nstand.  O! to think that I deemed thee well-nigh a true man.\n\nHe dropped her hands now and stood aloof from her, staring at her,\nand presently cast himself on the ground, rolling about and tearing\nat the grass.  She looked on him a moment or two, and then stepped\nforward and stooped to him, and touched his shoulder and said:  Rise\nup, I bid thee, and be a man and not a wild beast.\n\nSo in a while he arose, and stood before her hang-dog-like; then she\nlooked on him pitifully, and said:  Fair sir and valiant knight, thou\nhast gone out of thy mind for a while, and thus hast thou shamed both\nme and thyself; and now thou wert best forget it, and therewithal my\nlast words to thee.\n\nTherewith she held out her hand to him, and he went on his knees and\ntook it, sobbing, and kissed it.  But she said, and smiled on him:\nNow I see that thou wilt do what I prayed of thee, and lead me hence\nand put me on the road to the Castle of the Quest.  He said:  I will\nlead thee to the Castle of the Quest.\n\nSaid Birdalone:  Then shall it be as I promised, that I will be thy\ndear friend while both we live.  And now, if thou canst, be a little\nmerrier, and come and sit with me, and let us eat our meat, for I\nhunger.\n\nHe smiled, but woefully, and presently they sat down to their meat;\nand he strove to be somewhat merry of mood, and to eat as one at a\nfeast; but whiles his heart failed him, and he set his teeth and tore\nat the grass, and his face was fierce and terrible to look on; but\nBirdalone made as if she heeded it nought, and was blithe and\ndebonair with him.  And when they had done their meat he sat looking\nat her a while, and at last he said:  Lady, dost thou deem that, when\nall is said, I have done somewhat for thee since first we met the day\nbefore yesterday at the lower end of the Black Valley?  Yea, she\nsaid, as erst I spake, all things considered I deem that thou hast\ndone much.  And now, said he, I am to do more yet; for I am to lead\nthee to where henceforth I shall have no more part or lot in thee\nthan if thou wert in heaven and I in hell.  I pray thee say not so,\nsaid Birdalone; have I not said that I will be thy friend?  Lady,\nsaid the knight, I wot well that according to the sweetness of thine\nheart wilt thou do what thou canst do.  And therewith he was silent a\nwhile and she also.\n\nThen he said:  I would ask thee a grace if I durst.  Ask it, said\nshe, and I will grant it if I may; I have gainsaid thee enough\nmeseemeth.\n\nLady, he said, I will ask this as a reward of the way-leader, to wit,\nthat thou abide with me here in this dale, in all honour holden, till\nto-morrow morning; and let this place, which has helped me aforetime,\nbe hallowed by thy dwelling here; and I, I shall have had one happy\nday at least, if never another.  Canst thou grant me this?  If thou\ncanst not, we will depart in an hour.\n\nHer countenance fell at his word, and she was silent a while; for\nsore she longed to be speedily whereas her friends should find her if\nthey came back to the castle.  But she thought within herself how\nwild and fierce the man was, and doubted if he might not go stark mad\non her hands and destroy her if she thwarted overmuch; and, moreover,\nfrankly she pitied him, and would do what she might to ease his pain\nand solace his grief of heart.  Wherefore she cleared her face of its\ntrouble and let it be vexed no longer, but smiled upon the knight and\nsaid:  Fair sir, this meseemeth but a little thing for me to do, and\nI grant it thee with a good will, and this shall now be the first day\nof the friendship if so thou wilt take it; and may it solace thee.\n\nWho then was gleeful but the knight, and strange it was to see all\nhis sorrow run off him; and he became glad and gamesome as a youth,\nand yet withal exceeding courteous and kind with her, as though he\nwere serving a mighty queen.\n\nSo then they wore the day together in all good fellowship; and first\nthey went up the dale together and right to the foot of that great\nforce, where the stream came thundering down from the sheer rocks;\nand long Birdalone stood to look thereon, and much she marvelled at\nit, for no such thing had she seen before.\n\nThereafter they went afoot into the wood behind the green bower, and\nwhen they had gone some way therein for their pleasure, they fell to\nseeking venison for their dinner; and the knight took Birdalone's bow\nand shafts to strike the quarry withal, but he would have her gird\nhis sword to her, that she might not be weaponless.  So they gat them\na roe and came back therewith to the bower, and the knight dight it\nand cooked it, and again they ate in fellowship and kindness; and\nBirdalone had been to the river and fetched thence store of blue-\nflowered mouse-ear, and of meadow-sweet, whereof was still some left\nfrom the early days of summer, and had made her garlands for her head\nand her loins; and the knight sat and worshipped her, yet he would\nnot so much as touch her hand, sorely as he hungered for the beauty\nof her body.\n\nNext, when dinner was done, and they lay in the shadow of the trees,\nand hearkened the moor-hen crying from the water, and the moaning of\nthe wood-doves in the high trees, she turned to him and bade him tell\nher somewhat of the tale of his life and deeds; but he said:  Nay,\nlady, I pray thee pardon me, for little have I to tell thee that is\ngood, and I would not have thee know of me aught worse than thou\nknowest of me already.  Rather be thou kind to me, and tell me of thy\ndays that have been, wherein I know full surely shall be nought but\ngood.\n\nShe smiled and blushed, but without more ado fell to telling him of\nher life in the House under the Wood, and spared not even to tell him\nsomewhat of the wood-mother.  And he said no word to her thereover,\nsave thanks and praises for the kindness of her story.\n\nAt last the day wore to its ending, and then the knight's grief\nstrode over him again, and he was moody and few-spoken; and Birdalone\nwas blithe with him still, and would have solaced his grief; but he\nsaid:  Let it be; as for thee, thou shalt be happy to-morrow, but\nthis happy day of mine is well-nigh worn, and it is as the wearing of\nmy life.  And the dark night came, and he bade her good-night\nsorrowfully, and departed to his lair in the wood.  Birdalone lay in\nthe bower, and might not sleep a long while for her joy of the\nmorrow, which should bring her back to the Castle of the Quest.\n\nBut when morning was, and the sun was but just risen, Birdalone\nawoke, and stood up and did on her raiment, and called her servant\nthe knight, and he came at once leading the two horses, and said:\nNow go we to the Castle of the Quest.  And he was sober and\nsorrowful, but nought fierce or wild.\n\nSo Birdalone thanked him kindly and praised him, and he changed\ncountenance no whit therefor.\n\nThen they mounted and set forth, and the knight led straight into the\nwood, and by roads that he wotted of, so that they went nowise slowly\nfor wenders through the thick woodland.  Thus went they on their way\ntogether, he sorry and she glad.\n\nBut now leaves the tale to tell of Birdalone and the knight on whom\nshe happened in the Black Valley of the Greywethers, and turns to the\nCastle of the Quest and the folk thereof, and what they did in this\nwhile and thereafter.\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Part of the Water of the Wondrous Isles, which\nis called Of the Days of Abiding, and the Fifth Part now begins,\nwhich is called The Tale of the Quest's Ending.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIFTH PART:  THE TALE OF THE QUEST'S ENDING\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.  OF SIR LEONARD'S TROUBLE AND THE COMING OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nTells the tale that when the chaplain had departed from Birdalone at\nthe bower in the copse, he went home to the castle sadly enough,\nbecause of his love and longing for her, which well he wotted might\nnever be satisfied.  Moreover when he was come into the castle again,\nthere fell fear upon him for what might betide her, and he rued it\nthat he had done her will in getting her forth of the castle; and in\nvain now he set before himself all the reasons for deeming that her\nperil herein was little or nothing, even as he had laid them before\nher, and which he then believed in utterly, whereas now himseemed\nthere was an answer to every one of them.  So he sighed heavily and\nwent into the chapel, wherein was an altar of St. Leonard; and he\nknelt thereat, and prayed the saint, as he had erst delivered folk\nfrom captivity, now to deliver both him and Birdalone from peril and\nbonds; but though he was long a-praying and made many words, it\nlightened his heart little or nothing; so that when he rose up again,\nthat if anything evil happened to this pearl of women, he wished\nheartily that some one might take his life and he be done with it.\n\nNow was the house astir, and the chaplain came from out the chapel,\nand thinking all things over, he thought he would go straight to Sir\nAymeris and make a clean breast of it, so that weaponed men might be\nsent at once to seek Birdalone.  And he said to himself:  What matter\nif he slay me or cast me into prison, if Birdalone be lost?\n\nSo he went his ways to the highest tower, which looked landward and\nhight the Open Eye, deeming to find Sir Aymeris; but when he got to\nthe topmost, he found neither captain nor carle there:  wherefore he\nstayed a little and looked forth betwixt the battlements, if\nperchance there were some wild chance of seeing Birdalone's coming\nhome again; but his keen eyes beheld nothing more than he looked to\nsee, as sheep and neat, and the field-folk of thereabouts.  So he\nturned away and went by the swale toward the next tallest tower,\nwhich looked lakewards, and was called Hearts' Hope; and as he went\nhe fell to framing in his mind the words which he should say to the\ncastellan.\n\nThus came he, haggard and hapless, on the leads of the tower, which\nwere nought small; and there gathered together in a knot, and all\ngazing eagerly out over the lake, he found a dozen of men-at-arms and\nthe castellan amongst them.  They took no heed of him as he came up,\nthough he stumbled as he crossed the threshold and came clattering\nover the lead floor, and he saw at once that there was something\nunwonted toward; but he had but one thought in his mind, to wit, the\nrescuing of Birdalone.\n\nHe went up now behind where the castellan was leaning over the\nbattlement, and pulled his skirt, and when Sir Aymeris turned round,\nhe said:  Lord, I have a word for thine ear.  But the old knight did\nbut half turn round, and then spake peevishly:  Tush, man! another\ntime! seest thou not I have got no eyes for aught save what we see on\nthe lake?  Yea, but what then? said the priest.  There cometh a boat,\nsaid Sir Aymeris, not looking back at him, and our thought is that\ntherein be our lords.\n\nWhen the priest heard that word, it was to him as if hell had opened\nunderneath his feet; and he had no might to speak for a minute; then\nhe cried out:  Sir Aymeris, hearken, I pray thee.  But the old knight\nbut thrust him back with his hand, and even therewith one of the men-\nat-arms cried out:  I hear the voice of their horn!  Then shouted Sir\nAymeris:  Where art thou, Noise?  Blow, man, blow, if ever thou\nblewest in all thy life!  And therewithal came the blare of the\nbrass, and Sir Aymeris nodded to the trumpeter, who blew blast after\nblast with all his might, so that the priest might as well have been\ndumb for any hearing he might get; and all the while to Leonard the\nminutes seemed hours, and he was well-nigh distraught.\n\nAnd then when the knight held up his hand for the Noise to stay his\nblowing, and Leonard strove to speak, the castellan turned on him and\nsaid:  Peace, Sir Leonard; dost thou not know that now we would\nlisten with our ears to heed if they answer us?  Not a word any one\nman of you, learned or lewd, or ye shall rue it!\n\nEven therewith came clearly the sound of the horn from the water, and\nagain and yet again; and no man spake but the chaplain, who cried\nout:  Hearken, knight, it is of Birdalone.  But Sir Aymeris laid his\nhand on his shoulder and said in an angry whisper:  Thou shalt be put\ndownstairs, priest, if thou hold not thy peace.\n\nLeonard drew aback scowling, and went out of the door, and so slowly\ndown the stair, and withdrew him into the cover of the door of the\nfirst chamber down from the tower-top, with the mind to waylay Sir\nAymeris as he came down; and meanwhile he cursed him for a fool and a\ndull-wit, and himself yet more, as was but right, for a fool and a\nlicorous traitor.\n\nBut he had not tarried there more than a score of minutes, ere he\nheard a great shout from those up above:  They are come! they are\ncome!  And next thereafter came all the men clattering down the stair\npast him, scarce refraining them from shoving each his neighbour on\nto the next one; Leonard followed on them, and presently arose great\nshouting and tumult through all the house, and all folk, men and\nwomen, hurried flock-meal toward the water-gate, and with them went\nLeonard perforce; and sick of heart he was, calling to mind the first\ncoming thither of Birdalone.\n\nBut now when they came to the water-gate, there verily was the\nSending Boat just coming to hand; and in the stern stood the three\nknights together, all clad in their armour, and before them sat three\nlovely ladies, clad one in gold, one in green, and one in black:  and\nlo, there was the Quest come home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  NOW ASK THEY OF BIRDALONE, AND SIR LEONARD SPEAKS\n\n\n\nNow the prow touched the stones of the stair, and folk were busy to\nlay hold of it that the wayfarers might land, but Sir Baudoin cried\nout in a great voice:  Let none be so hardy as to touch this ferry,\neither now or hereafter; for there is peril therein.  And therewith\nhe took Aurea by the hand, and led her out of the boat and up the\nstair, and she all joyous and wondering; and thereafter came Hugh and\nhis darling, and last of all Arthur and Atra, and she alone of the\nthree women looked downcast, and her eyes wandered about the throng\nthat was before them there, as though she sought something, yet\nfeared to see it.\n\nBut when they were all standing together on the landing-plain, and\nthe folk were all about them in a ring, Sir Baudoin spake to the\ncastellan and said:  Sir Aymeris, thee and other folk I see here, the\nsight of whom doth me great joy; but where, I pray thee, is the lady,\nour friend Birdalone, by whom it is that all we are come happily\nhither?  And he looked around with an anxious face; but Arthur was as\npale as ashes, yet he spake nought, and Atra let her hand fall away\nfrom his.\n\nThen spake the castellan, and said:  No harm hath befallen the Lady\nBirdalone; but whiles she hath been somewhat ailing of late, and it\nis like that she wotteth not what is toward, and keepeth her chamber\nnow, for it is yet betimes in the morning.\n\nAs he spake, came thrusting a man through the throng, eager and pale-\nfaced; who but the chaplain; and he said:  He would not let me speak,\nthis fool; I cannot choose my time.  Lords, I bear evil tidings and\nan ugly welcome home.  The Lady Birdalone is in peril, and she is not\nin the castle; I wot not where she is.  Ye must send armed men to\nseek her out.\n\nThereat fell the silence of woe upon the throng; but Arthur ran\nforward on the priest with drawn sword, and cried out:  I misdoubt me\nthat thou art a traitor; speak! or I will slay thee here and now.  If\nI be a traitor, quoth Leonard, I shall tell thee in little while what\nye must do to undo my treason, if there be yet time thereto; so slay\nme not till ye have heard, and then do what ye will with me.\n\nBut Baudoin put Arthur aside, and said:  Refrain thee a little, fair\nbrother, else shall words tumble over each other and we shall know\nnothing clear.  Sir Aymeris, bring our dear ladies to the fairest\nchambers, and do all honour and courtesy to them.  And ye,\nsweetlings, ye will not begrudge us that we go to seek your friend.\nThou priest, come with us a little apart, and tell thy tale as\nshortly as thou mayst, and fear nought; we be not God's dastards, as\nthe Red Knight and his men.\n\nViridis wept and kissed her love before all folk, and bade him go and\ndo his best to find her friend, or never come back to her else.  Much\nmoved, even to tears, was Aurea withal, and reached her hand to\nBaudoin, and said:  If any man on earth can help us it is thou.  Go\nthou.  But Atra wept not, and but said to Arthur:  Go thou, it is\nmeet.\n\nTherewith were the ladies brought to fair chambers; but the three\nknights went with the priest and Sir Aymeris into the solar, and set\na guard at the door that their talk should be privy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  HOW THEY FOLLOW THE SLOT OF BIRDALONE AND THE BLACK\nKNIGHT\n\n\n\nIt was but five minutes ere the priest had told them all that need\nwas; so they let him abide alone there, though sooth to say there was\nnone of them but had good will to break his neck; and the same rede\nhad all three, that there was nought for it but to go their ways with\nall speed to the Black Valley of the Greywethers, and follow up the\nslot of Birdalone if it might yet be found; wherefore they bade\nsaddle their horses straightway; and while that was a-doing they ate\na morsel, and bade farewell to their lovelings.  And they dight them\nto go, they three together, with but one squire and a sergeant, who\nwere both of them keen trackers and fell woodsmen.  But ere they\nwent, by the rede of Arthur they bade Sir Aymeris to arm a two score\nof men and ride toward the Red Hold, and beset the ways 'twixt that\nand the Castle of the Quest; for one and all they deemed that if any\nharm befell Birdalone, the Red Knight would be at the bottom of it.\n\nSo rode those fellows, and came unto the dale but some four hours\nafter Birdalone had happened on the stranger knight; and they took up\nthe slot of her, but not easily, whereas the ground was hard and\nstony; howbeit, they found tokens of the knight also, finding here\nand there what they deemed the footprints of a tall man.  And this\nwas grievous to those fellows, since now they could not but deem that\nsomewhat untoward had befallen Birdalone.  But they went on making\nout the slot, and they followed it with much toil until they came to\nthe doom-ring in the head of the dale, whereas Birdalone and the\nstranger had sat down to meat; but by that time, so toilsome had been\ntheir going, it was somewhat more than dusk, and there was nought for\nit but to abide there night-long.  So a while they sat talking, all\nof them, and the squire and the sergeant aforesaid were not a little\ntimorous of the adventure of making that stead unkenned their\nsleeping chamber; and to while away the time, their lords made them\ntell tales such as they knew concerning that place; and both they\nsaid that they had never erst come into the dale but a very little\nway, and said that they had done so then but trusting in their lords'\nbidding and the luck of the Quest.  Thereafter turned the talk as to\nwhat had befallen Birdalone, and the chances of coming on her; and,\nas folk will in such a plight, they talked the matter over and over\nagain till they were weary and could say no more.\n\nThen they went to sleep, and nought befell them till they awoke in\nthe broad daylight; but they had little inkling of what hour it was,\nfor all the dale was full of thick white mist that came rolling down\nfrom the mountains, so that they could scarce see their hands before\nthem, and there they had to tarry still, would they, would they not;\nand the sergeant fell to telling tales of folk who had been lost in\nthat stony maze; and all of them deemed, more or less, that this was\nthe work either of evil wights, or it might be of the wizardry of the\nRed Knight; and, to be short, they all deemed that he it was who had\nwielded it, save the sergeant, who said that the mountain wights were\nthe masters and not the servants of him of the Red Hold.\n\nThus, then, it betided; but when the said mist had been hanging upon\nthem for some six hours, it rolled up like a curtain, and lo the blue\nsky and the sun, and the mountains as clear blue as in a picture; and\nthey saw by the sun that it was but a little after high noon.\n\nBut as they rejoiced herein, and betook them once more to tracking\nout the slot of Birdalone and the other, the sky became suddenly\novercast, and down from the jaws of the mountain came a storm of wind\nand rain, and thunder and lightning, so great that they might scarce\nsee each other's faces, and when it cleared off, in about an hour and\na half, and went down the wind to the south-east, the stream was\nwaxen great, and ran brown and furious down the dale, so that it was\nfordable only here and there; and as for tracking the slot of those\ntwain, there was no need to talk thereof, for the fury of the driving\nrain had washed all away.\n\nThus fared they the whole day betwixt fog and clear weather, and they\nlaid them down to rest at night sore disheartened.  When the day\nbroke they talked together as to what was best to do; and the\nsergeant aforesaid spake:  Lords, said he, meseemeth I am more at\nhome in the Black Valley than ye be; heed ye not wherefore.  Now so\nit is that if we tarry here till night come we wot not what of evil\nmay betide us, or at the least we do nought.  Or if we turn back and\ngo southward out of the dale we shall be safe indeed; but safe should\nwe have been at your house, lords, and should have done no less.  But\nnow I shall tell you that, if ye will, lords, I shall guide you to a\npass that goeth out of the head of the dale to our right hands, and\nso turneth the flank of the mountains, and cometh out into the\ncountry which lieth about the Red Hold; and meseemeth it is\nthitherward that we must seek if we would hear any tidings of the\nlady; for there may we lay in ambush and beset the ways that lead up\nto the Hold, by which she must have been brought if she hath not been\ncarried through the air.  How say ye, lords?  Soothly there is peril\ntherein; yet meseemeth peril no more than in our abiding another\nnight in the Black Valley.\n\nSaid Arthur:  We heed not the peril if there be aught to be done;\nwherefore let us be stirring straightway.  And so said they all.\nWherefore they gat to horse, and rode up to the very head of the\nvalley, and the weather was now calm and bright.\n\nBut the sergeant brought them to the pass whereof the stranger knight\nhad spoken to Birdalone, which led into the Red Knight's country, and\nwithout more ado they entered it when it was now about three hours\nafter noon.  But the way was both steep and rough, so that they had\nmuch toil, and went not very far ere night fell upon them, and the\nmoon was not yet up.  So when they had stumbled on another two hours,\nand their horses were much spent and they themselves not a little\nweary, they laid them down to sleep, after they had eaten such meat\nas they had with them, in a place where was a little grass for the\nhorses to bite; for all the road hitherto had been mere grim stones\nand big rocks, walled on either side by stony screes, above which\nrose steep and beetling crags.\n\nIn the dawn they arose again, and made no ado till they were in the\nsaddle, and rode till they came to the crest of the pass, and came\nout thence after a while on to the swelling flank of a huge mountain\n(as it might be the side of the mountain of Plinlimmon in Wales),\nwhich was grassed and nought craggy, but utterly treeless.\n\nNow the sergeant led them somewhat athwart the said mountain till\nthey began to go down, and saw below them a country of little hills\nmuch covered with wood, and in a while, and ere it was noon, they\nwere among the said woods, which were grown mostly with big trees, as\noak here and beech there, and the going was good for them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  OF THE SLAYING OF FRIEND AND FOE\n\n\n\nSo came they, three hours after noon, to where was a clearing in the\nwoodland, and a long narrow plain some furlong over lay before them,\nwith a river running along it, and the wood rose on the other side\nhigh and thick, so that the said plain looked even as a wide green\nhighway leading from somewhence to somewhither.\n\nAt the edge hereof their way-leader, the sergeant, bade draw rein,\nand said:  Lords, we are now in the lands of the Red Hold, and\ntherein is mickle peril and dread to any save stout hearts as ye be;\nbut meseems we are so steaded, that whatever may come out of the\nBlack Valley of the Greywethers to the Red Hold, ye now may scarce\nmiss.  Yonder along this plain to the north lies the way to the said\nHold, and any man coming from the head of the valley is sure to come\nby the way we have come, and will pass us not many yards at the worst\nfrom where we now be.  On the other hand, if any come to the Hold\nfrom the mouth of the Black Valley, then along this green road must\nthey needs pass under your very eyes.  Lastly, if we do what we are\ncome to do, to wit, to deliver the lady from the Red Knight, then,\nthe deed done, we have to take the green road southward, and ride it\nfor a league and then turn east, and we shall have our heads turned\ntoward the Castle of the Quest, and shall speedily fall in with Sir\nAymeris and our men who be guarding the out-gates of the Red Knight's\ncountry toward our house.  So now, by my rede, ye shall lay in covert\nhere and abide a while what may befall; if nought come hereby ere two\nhours be lacking of sunset, then may we seek further.\n\nThey all yeasaid this, and gat off their horses, and lay quiet on the\ngrass, not even speaking save softly.  And when they had abided thus\nscarce an hour's space, the squire, who was a man of very fine ear,\nheld up his hand as though to bid utter silence, and all hearkened\neagerly.  Presently he said:  Hear ye not?  Said Arthur:  Meseemeth I\nhear a faint tinkle as of a sheep-bell.  Said the squire:  'Tis the\nclashing of swords down the plain to the south, and meseemeth 'tis\nbut of two:  ride we thither?\n\nQuoth Baudoin:  Nay, not by my rede; for if we can hear them they can\nhear us; let us quietly edge along afoot somewhat nigher their way,\never keeping the cover of the wood betwixt us and the open plain.\nNow then to it; and let each man keep his weapons ready.\n\nEven so did they, and spread out in a line as they went, in such wise\nthat there was some six paces betwixt each man of them, and they went\nsoftly forward; Baudoin went first, Hugh second, then Arthur; then\nthe squire and the sergeant last of all.\n\nNow when they had gone but a quarter of an hour, the squire caught up\nwith Arthur, and spake to him softly, and said:  The voice of the\nswords has been silent now a while, and I heard a voice crying out\ne'en now, a woman's voice.  And now again I could well-nigh deem that\nI hear horse-hoofs.\n\nArthur nodded to him, and they went but a little further ere he said:\nLo, lo! 'tis the time of the eyes now!  Here come folk.  And\ntherewithal they stayed them.  For the wood turned somewhat here, so\nas to hide all but a little of the plain, and round the wood neb the\nnew-comers hove in sight, and were close on them at once, so that\nthey might see them clearly, to wit, a knight weaponed, clad all in\nred, a very big man, riding on a great bay horse, and behind him a\nwoman going afoot in very piteous plight; for she was tethered to the\nhorse's crupper by a thong that bound her wrists together, so that\nshe had but just room left 'twixt her and the horse that she might\nwalk, and round about her neck was hung a man's head newly hewn off.\n\nThis sight they all saw at once, and were out of the wood in a trice\nwith weapons aloft, for they knew both the man and the woman, that\nthey were the Red Knight and Birdalone.\n\nSo swift and sudden had they been, that he had no time either to spur\nor even to draw his sword; but he had a heavy steel axe in his hand\nas the first man came up to him, which was the tall Baudoin; and\ntherewith he smote down on Baudoin so fierce and huge a stroke, that\ncame on him betwixt neck and shoulder, that all gave way before it,\nand the Golden Knight fell to earth all carven and stark dead:  but\neven therewith fell Hugh, the squire, and the sergeant on the Red\nKnight; for Arthur had run to Birdalone and sheared her loose from\nher tether.  The sergeant smote him on the right arm with a maul, so\nthat the axe fell to the ground; the squire's sword came on the side\nof his head, and, as it was cast back beneath the stroke, Hugh thrust\nhis sword through the throat of him, and down he fell unto the earth\nand was dead in less than a minute.\n\nThen gathered the others round about Baudoin, and saw at once that he\nwas dead; and Birdalone came thrusting through the press of them, and\nknelt down beside him, and when she saw her friend so piteously\ndight, she wept and wailed over him as one who might not be\ncomforted; and Hugh stood over her and let his tears fall down upon\nthe dead man; and withal the squire and the sergeant did not refrain\ntheir lamentations, for sore beloved was Sir Baudoin the Golden\nKnight.\n\nBut Arthur spake dry-eyed, though there was grief in his countenance,\nand he said:  Fellows, and thou, lady, let us lament afterwards, but\nnow is time for us to get us gone hence as speedily as may be.  Yet I\nwill ask, doth any know whose is this head that the slain tyrant here\nhad hung about the lady's neck?  May the fiends curse him therefor!\n\nSaid the sergeant:  Yea, lords, that wot I; this is the head of the\nRed Knight's captain and head man, Sir Thomas of Estcliffe; one of\nthe hardiest of knights he was while he was alive, as ye surely wot,\nlords; neither, as I have heard say, was he as cruel a tyrant as his\nlord that lieth there ready for the ravens.\n\nNow had Birdalone arisen and was standing facing Arthur; her face was\npale and full of anguish, and she was dabbled with blood from the\ndead man's neck; but there was nought of shame in her face as she\nstood there and spoke:  O my living friends, who have but now saved\nme, ye and my dead friends, from what shame and death I know not, the\ntale of this woeful hap is over long to tell if there be peril at\nhand, and I scarce alive from dread and sorrow; but shortly thus it\nis:  This man, whose head here lieth, entrapped me as I foolishly\nwandered in the Black Valley, and afterwards delivered me, and was\nleading me to your castle, my friends, when this other one, his\nmaster, the tyrant of the Red Hold, came upon him, and fell upon him\nand slew him as a traitor, and dighted me as ye saw.  And woe's me!\nI am the fool whose folly has slain your friend and mine.  Wherefore\nI am not worthy of your fellowship, and ye shall cast me forth of it;\nor to slay me were better.\n\nSo she spake, gazing earnestly on Arthur; and so troubled and\ngrieved, that she might well have died but for her woodland breeding,\nand the toil of the days she had won through in the House under the\nWood.\n\nBut Hugh spake gently to her and said:  Keep up thine heart yet,\nmaiden; for the hand of Fate it is that led thee, and none doeth\ngrievously amiss but if he mean wrong-doing in his heart; and we know\nthee for true; and thou hast been our helper, and brought our\nlovelings unto us to make us happy.\n\nBut she brake out weeping afresh, and said:  O no, no! it is but woe\nand weariness I have brought unto my friends; and to myself woe and\nweariness yet more.\n\nAnd she looked piteously into Arthur's face, and hard and stern it\nseemed unto her; and she writhed and wrung her hands for anguish.\nBut he spake and said:  This will we look into when we be safe behind\nour walls, and see what she hath done amiss and what not amiss.  But\nnow is there but one thing to do, and that is to get us speedily on\nour way to the Castle of the Quest, and bind our fellow's body on his\nhorse that he also may ride with us, and the lady shall ride the\nhorse of the accursed thief.  Then they turned to go toward their\nhorses; but therewith Birdalone smote her foot against the slain\nknight's head, and shrank aback from it, and pointed down toward it\nand spake no word; and Hugh said:  Friends, the lady is right, this\nat least we will cover with earth.  Do ye go fetch hither our horses,\nsince we be on the road, and I will do here what need is meanwhile.\n\nSo they went on that errand, and then Hugh and Birdalone between them\ndug a hole with the swords and laid the head of the captain of the\nRed Knight therein.  And forsooth, somewhat would Birdalone have wept\nfor him had she had a tear to spare.\n\nThen they fell to and bound the dead Baudoin on the Red Knight's\nmighty bay steed, so that no time might be wasted; and when that was\ndone, and the others had not come back with their horses, Hugh took\nBirdalone's hand and led her down to the stream and washed the gore\noff her bosom, and she washed her face and her hands and let him lead\nher back again in such wise that now she could hearken to the words\nof comfort he spake to her, and piteous kind he seemed unto her; so\nthat at last she plucked up heart, and asked him how Viridis did.\nQuoth he:  They be all safe at home in the castle, and Viridis is\nwell and loveth thee well.  And Aurea was well, woe worth the while\nfor her now!  As for Atra, she has not been so glad as the other\ntwain, I wot not wherefore.\n\nEven as he spake were the others come up with the horses, and Arthur\nnodded yeasay when he saw what had been done with Baudoin dead; and\nso they gat to horse, and Birdalone it was that rode Baudoin's steed.\nThen they went their ways, crossing the river into the wood; and the\nsergeant was ever way-leader, but the squire led the horse which bore\nthe sorrowful burden of the dead Knight of the Quest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  THEY COME HOME TO THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nNow they had gone but some three hours, riding dreary and nigh\nspeechless all of them, ere they began to know the land they were in,\nand that they were coming to the place where they might look\npresently to fall in with Sir Aymeris and his company; and even so\nthe meeting betid, that they saw men standing and going about their\nhorses beside a little wood, and knew them presently for their folk,\nwho mounted at once and spurred forward to meet them, spears aloft.\nSpeedily then was the joy of those abiders turned into sorrow, nor\nmay the grief of Sir Aymeris be told, so great it was; and Birdalone\nlooked on and saw the mourning and lamentation of the warriors, and\neked was her anguish of mind; and she beheld Arthur the Black Squire,\nhow he sat still upon his horse with a hard and dreary countenance,\nand looked on those mourners almost as if he contemned them.  But Sir\nAymeris came up to Birdalone, and knelt before her and kissed her\nhand, and said:  If my heart might rejoice in aught, as some day it\nwill, it would rejoice in seeing thee safe and sound, lady; here at\nleast is gain to set beside the loss.\n\nShe thanked him, but looked askance toward Arthur, who said:  If that\nbe gain, yet is there more, for the Red Knight lieth in the green\nplain for a supper to the wolf and the crow.  Vengeance there hath\nbeen, and belike more yet may come.  But now, if ye have lamented as\nmuch as ye deem befitteth warriors, let us tarry here no longer; for\neven yet meseemeth shall we be safer behind walls, now that our chief\nand captain is slain, I scarce know in what quarrel.\n\nNone naysaid it, so they all rode forth together, and the sergeant\nand the squire and Sir Hugh told of their tale what they might to Sir\nAymeris and the others; but Arthur held his peace, and rode aloof\nfrom Birdalone, whereas Sir Aymeris and Hugh rode on either side of\nher, and did not spare to comfort her what they might.\n\nThey rode straight on, and made no stay for nightfall, and thus came\nhome to the Castle of the Quest before the day was full; and woeful\nwas their entry as they went in the dawn underneath the gate of the\nsaid castle, and soon was the whole house astir and lamenting.\n\nAs for Birdalone, when she got down from her horse in the gateway,\nand was stiff and weary of body, and all dazed and confused of mind,\nthere was but little life in her; nor could she so much as think of\nthe new day and Aurea's awakening, but crept up unto her own chamber,\nso long as it seemed since she had left it, though it was but a\nlittle while; and she cast herself upon the bed and fell asleep\nwhether she would or not, and so forgat her much sorrow and her\nlittle hope.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.  OF THE TALK BETWIXT BIRDALONE AND VIRIDIS\n\n\n\nWhen she woke again, she had slept the night away, and it was broad\nday, and for a moment she lay wondering what was the burden upon her;\nbut presently she called it all to mind, and deemed it were well\nmight she forget it all again.  Anon she became aware of someone\nmoving about the chamber, and she looked about unhappily; and lo! a\nwoman, fair and dainty, clad all in green, and it was Viridis that\nhad come there.  But when she saw Birdalone stirring, she came up to\nher and kissed her sweetly and kindly, and wept over her, so that\nBirdalone might nowise refrain her tears.  But when she might cease\nweeping, she said to Viridis:  Tell me, art thou weeping for thy\nfriend who is lost, and who shall be thy friend no more; or thy\nfriend whom thou hast found?  Said Viridis:  Forsooth I have wept for\nBaudoin plenteously, and he is worthy of it, for he was valiant and\ntrue and kind.  Said Birdalone:  True is that; but I meant not my\nquestion so; but rather I would ask thee if thou weepest because\nthine heart must needs cast me away, or because thou hast found me\nagain?  Quoth Viridis:  Whoso may be dead, or whoso alive, but if it\nwere Hugh, my loveling, I were rejoiced beyond measure to find thee,\nmy friend.  And again she kissed her as one who was glad and kind.\nBut for new rest of soul and for joy, Birdalone fell a-weeping\nafresh.\n\nAgain she spake:  And what mind have the others about me?  For thou\nart but one, though the dearest, save . . .  And would they punish me\nfor my fault and folly that has slain the best man in the world?  If\nthe punishment be short of putting me forth of their fellowship, I\nwere fain thereof.\n\nViridis laughed:  Forsooth, she said, they have much to punish thee\nfor! whereas it was by thy doing and thy valiance that we all came\ntogether again and the Quest was accomplished.  Nay, but tell me,\nsaid Birdalone, what do they say of me, each one of them?\n\nViridis reddened; she said:  Hugh, my mate, saith all good of thee;\nthough no one of carl-folk may be sorrier of the loss of his fellow.\nAurea layeth not the death of her man upon thee; and she saith:  When\nthe fountain of tears is dried up in me, I will see her and comfort\nher, as she me.  Atra saith:  she saith but little, yet she saith:\nSo is it fated.  I had done belike no better, but worse than she.\n\nNow turned Birdalone red and then pale again, and she said, but in a\nquavering voice:  And the Black Squire, Arthur, what sayeth he?  Said\nViridis:  He sayeth nought of thee, but that he would hear all the\ntale of what befell thee in the Black Valley.  Sweet friend, said\nBirdalone, I pray thee of thy kindness and sweetness that thou go\nunto him presently and bring him in hither, and then I will tell him\nall; and he and thou and I together.\n\nViridis said:  There is this to be said, that when a man loveth a\nwoman he coveteth her, to have her all wholly to himself, and hard\nand evil he groweth for the time that he misdoubteth her whom he\nloveth.  And I will tell thee that this man is jealous lest thou wert\nnever so little kind to the slain stranger knight whose head the\ntyrant hung about thee.  Furthermore, I fear there is no help for it\nthat thou wilt undo the happiness of one of us, that is Atra; yet\nwere it better that that befell later than sooner.  And if Sir Arthur\ncome in here to thee, and hath thy tale with none beside save me,\nmeseems the poor Atra will feel a bitter smart because of it.  Were\nit not better that we all meet presently in the solar, and that there\nthou tell thy tale to us all? and thereafter shall we tell the tale\nof our deliverance and our coming hither.  And thus doing, it will\nseem less like to the breaking up of our fellowship.\n\nSaid Birdalone:  It will be hard for me to tell my tale before Atra\nand before him.  Might it not be that thou hearken to it here and\nnow, and tell it to the others hereafter?  Nay, nay, said Viridis, I\nam not a proper minstrel to take the word out of thy mouth.  Never\nshall I be able to tell it so that they shall trow it as if they had\nseen it all.  Besides, when all is told, then shall we be more bound\ntogether again.  I pray thee, and I pray thee, sweet, do so much for\nme as to tell thy tale to the fellowship of us.  And if it be hard to\nthee, look upon it as my share of the punishment which is due to thee\nfor falling into that mishap.\n\nSmiled Birdalone ruefully, and said:  So be it; and may the share of\nthe others be as light as thine, sister.  Yet soothly were I liefer\nthat my body and my skin should pay the forfeit.  But now, since I\nmust needs do this, the sooner is the better meseemeth.\n\nIn a little half hour, said Viridis, will I bring what is left of our\nfellowship into the solar to hearken thee.  So come thou there unto\nus when thou art clad.  And hear thou! be not too meek and humble,\nand bow thyself to us in fear of our sorrow.  For whereas thou didst\nspeak of our punishing thee, there will be one there whom thou mayst\neasily punish to thy pleasure; forsooth, friend, I rue that so it is;\nbut since it will not better be, what may I do but wish thee happy\nand him also.\n\nTherewith she turned and went out of the chamber, and Birdalone, left\nto herself, felt a secret joy in her soul that she might not master,\ndespite the sorrow of her friends, whatever it might be.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.  BIRDALONE TELLETH THE TALE OF HER WANDERING UP THE\nVALLEY OF THE GREYWETHERS\n\n\n\nNow Viridis did as she said, and brought them all in to the solar;\nthere was none lacking save Baudoin, and they sat silently in a half\nring, till the door opened and Birdalone came in to them, clad all\nsimply in but a black coat; and she made obeisance to them, and stood\nthere with her head bent down as if they were her judges, for so in\nsooth she deemed them.  Then Hugh bade her sit down amongst them; but\nshe said:  Nay, I will not sit amongst you till ye have heard my\nstory, and ye have told me that I am yet of your fellowship.  None\nsaid aught; Atra looked straight before her, and her eyes met not\nBirdalone's eyes; Arthur looked down on the ground; but Hugh and\nViridis looked kindly on Birdalone, and to Viridis' eyes the tears\nwere come.\n\nThen spake Birdalone and said:  I am here as one that hath done\namiss; but I will tell you, so that ye may not think worse of me than\nye should, that when ye were gone, ye Champions, and the time wore\nlong that ye came not again, it lay heavy on my heart, and hope waned\nand fear waxed, and my soul so grieved my body that I thought to fall\nsick thereof, and I knew that it would be ill for you to come home\nhither and find me sick; so that I longed sore to do somewhat which\nshould make me whole again.  Then weird would that I should hear all\nthe tale of the Black Valley of the Greywethers, and of how therein\nis whiles granted fulfilment of desire; and methought how well it\nwere if I might seek the adventure there and accomplish it.  Thereof,\ndoubtless, hath the chaplain, Sir Leonard, told you; but this\nfurthermore would I say, that his doing herein was nought; all was\ndone by my doing and by my bidding, and he might not choose but do\nit.  Wherefore I do pray you all earnestly that ye keep no grudge\nagainst him, but pardon him all.  Tell me, then, will ye do thus\nmuch?\n\nSaid Hugh:  Let him be pardoned, if he can take pardon.  But Arthur\nspake not, and Birdalone looked on him anxiously, and her face was\nmoved, and it was with her throat as if she had swallowed something\ndown.  Then she spake again, and fell to tell them all that had betid\nto her when she went to the Black Valley, even as is hereafore writ,\nhiding nought that had been done and said; and freely she told it,\nwithout fear or shame, and with such clearness and sweetness of words\nthat no one of them doubted her aught; and Arthur lifted up his head,\nand once and again his eyes met hers, and there was nought of\nhardness in them, though they turned away at once.\n\nSo at last fell Birdalone to telling what betid after they two, the\nstranger knight and she, left the valley of the force and fell to\nriding the wildwood with their heads turned toward the Castle of the\nQuest; and she said:\n\nWhen we turned into the wood away from the said valley it lacked some\nfour hours of noon; and we rode till noon was, and rested by a\nstream-side and ate, for we knew no cause wherefore we should hasten\novermuch; but my fellow the strange knight was downcast and heavy,\nand some might have called him sullen.  But I strove to make him of\nbetter cheer, and spake to him kindly, as to one who of an enemy had\nbecome a friend; but he answered me:  Lady, it availeth not; I grieve\nthat I am no better company than thou seest me, and I have striven to\nbe merrier; but apart from all that I wot and that thou wottest which\nshould make me of evil cheer, there is now a weight upon my heart\nwhich I cannot lift, such as never have I felt erst.  So by thy leave\nwe will to horse at once, that we may the speedier come to the Castle\nof the Quest and Sir Aymeris' prison.\n\nSo I arose, but smiled on him and said:  Hold up thine heart, friend!\nfor thee shall be no prison at the Castle of the Quest, but the fair\nwelcome of friends.  He said nought, and mended not his cheer; and in\nthis plight we gat to horse and rode on for some three hours more,\ntill we came out of the thick forest into a long clearing, which went\nlike a wide highway of greensward between the thicket, and it seemed\nas if the hand of man had cleared that said green road.  Thereto we\nhad come, following a little river which came out on to the clearing\nwith us, and then, turning, ran well-nigh amidst it toward the north.\n\nNow when we were come thither, and were betwixt the thicket and the\nwater's edge, we drew rein, and it seemed to me as fair a stead as\nmight be in the woodland, and I looked thereon well pleased and with\na happy heart.  But the knight said:  Lady, art thou not exceeding\nweary?  Nay, said I, not in any wise.  Said he:  It is strange then,\nfor so weary am I, that I must in any case get off my horse and lay\nme down on the grass here, or I shall drop from the saddle.  And\ntherewith he lighted down and stood by me a little, as to help me off\nmy horse; but I said to him:  Knight, I pray thee, even if ye be\nweary, to struggle forward a little, lest we be in peril here.  In\nperil? quoth he; yea, that might be if the Red Knight knew of our\nwhereabouts; but how should that be?  He spoke this heavily, as one\nscarce awake; and then he said:  I pray thee pardon me, lady, but for\nnought may I hold my head up; suffer me to sleep but a little, and\nthen will I arise and lead thee straight to thy journey's end.\nTherewithal he laid him down on the grass and was presently asleep,\nand I sat down by him all dismayed.  At first, indeed, I doubted some\ntreachery in him, for how might I trust him wholly after all that had\ncome and gone? but when I saw that there was no feigning in his\nsleep, I set that doubt aside, and knew not what to make of it.\n\nThus passed an hour, and from time to time I shook him and strove to\nwaken him, but it was all in vain; so I knew none other rede than to\nabide his awakening; for I knew not the way to take toward this\ncastle; and, moreover, though he were a knight, and armed, yet might\nit be perilous for him if he were left there alone and unguarded; so\nI abode.\n\nBut now came new tidings.  Methought I heard the sound of the\ntinkling of weapons and armour; the green highway so turned that a\nwood neb about an hundred yards to the north hid it from my sight, so\nthat a man might have drawn somewhat near to us without being seen,\ncame he on the hither side of the river.  So I stood up hastily, and\nstrung my bow, and took a shaft in my fingers, and no sooner was it\ndone than there came a rider round about the aforesaid wood neb.  He\nwas all-armed and had a red surcoat, and rode a great shining bay\nhorse.  I kept my eye upon him while I stirred the sleeping knight\nwith my foot, and cried to him to wake, but he scarce moved, and but\nuttered words without sense.\n\nNow the new-comer drew rein for a moment when he saw us, and then\nmoved on a little toward me, but I nocked a shaft and pointed it at\nhim, and cried out to him to stay.  Then I heard a great rattling\nlaugh come from him, and he shouted:  Nay, do thou stay, fair wood-\nwife, and I will risk thy shafts to come at thee.  But why doth not\nthe sluggard at thy feet rise up and stand before me, if he be thy\nloveling?  Or is he dead?  His voice was harsh and big, and I feared\nhim sore; and it was as much because of fear as of hardihood, that I\ndrew and loosed straightway; and doubtless it was because of fear\nthat I saw my shaft fly an inch or so over his right shoulder.  I\nheard his rattling laugh again, and saw him bend forward as he\nspurred; I knew that time lacked for drawing another shaft, so I\ncaught up my skirts and ran all I might; but swift-foot as I be, it\navailed me nought, for I was cumbered with my gown, and moreover I\nwas confused with not knowing whither to run, since I wotted that in\nthe water the horse would do better than I.\n\nSo he was up with me in a twinkling, and reached out his hand and\ncaught hold of me by the hair, and tugged me to him as he reined back\nhis horse.  Then he laughed again and said:  Forsooth she will look\nbetter when she is no longer reddened and roughened with fleeing;\nand, by Red Peter! what limbs she hath.  Then he let me loose and got\noff his horse, and shoved me on before him till we came to where the\nBlack One lay still sleeping heavily.  Then the Red Knight stood\nagainst me, and looked hard into my face; and I saw how huge a man he\nwas, and how a lock of bright red hair came out from under his\nsallet.  His eyes were green and fierce underneath shaggy red\neyebrows; terrible he was to look on.\n\nNow he spake fiercely and roughly, and as though he had something\nagainst me:  Tell me, thou, who thou art and who this is?  I answered\nnought, for fear had frozen my speech.  He stamped his foot on the\nground and cried:  Hah! art thou gone dumb?  Speak! thou wert best!\nI said, all quaking:  My name is Birdalone; I belong to no one; I\nhave no kindred:  as for this man, I know not his name.  He said:\nComest thou from the Castle of the Quest?  Art thou the whore of\nthose lily-and-rose champions there?  My heart was hot with anger in\nspite of my dread, but I spake:  I came from the Castle of the Quest.\nHe said:  And this man (therewith he turned about and spurned him in\nthe side), where didst thou happen upon him?  Again I was silent, and\nhe roared out at me:  So thou wilt not answer!  Beware, or I may see\nhow to compel the speech of thee.  Now answer me this:  Was it in the\nBlack Valley of the Greywethers that ye two came together?  Again I\nknew not how to answer, lest I might do a wrong to him who had\nrepented him of the wrong he had done me.  But the Red Knight burst\nout a-laughing and said:  It shall be remembered against thee, first,\nthat thou didst let fly a shaft at me; second, that thou didst run\nfrom me; and thirdly, that thou hast been slack in answering my\nquestions.  But all this scathes me nought; first, because thy shaft\nmissed me; second, because thy legs failed thee (though they were\nfair to look on, running); and third, because all thou canst tell me\nI know without thine answering.  Now thee will I tell that this is\nFriday, and that ye two first met in the Black Valley on Tuesday; now\nI will ask this last question, and thou mayst answer it or not as\nthou wilt; for presently I shall wake this brisk and stirring knight,\nand I deem that he will tell me the truth of this if of nought else.\nTell me, thou whore of the Questing Champions, where and how many\ntimes thou hast lain in this good knight's arms since last Tuesday?\nNowhere and never, quoth I.  Thou liest, I doubt thee, said the Red\nKnight; howsoever, let us see what this doughty one will say.  Hah!\nthou deemest he shall be hard to wake up, dost thou not!  Well, I\nshall see to that.  He who giveth sleep may take it away again.\n\nTherewith he went up to the Black One and stooped adown over his\nhead, and spake some words over him, but so softly that I heard not\ntheir import; and straightway the sleeper rose up so suddenly that he\nwellnigh smote against the Red Knight.  He stood awhile staggering,\nand blinking at the other one, but somehow got his sword drawn forth,\nand the Red Knight hindered him nought therein, but spake anon when\nthe other was come to himself somewhat:  The sele of the day to thee,\nSir Thomas, True Thomas!  Fair is thy bed, and most fair thy\nbedfellow.\n\nThe Black Knight drew aback from him and was now come awake,\nwherefore he stood on his guard, but said nought.  Then said the Red\nKnight:  Sir Thomas, I have been asking this fair lady a question,\nbut her memory faileth her and she may not answer it; perchance thou\nmayst do better.  Tell me where and how many times hast thou bedded\nher betwixt last Tuesday and this?  Nowhere and never, cried Sir\nThomas, knitting his brows and handling his sword.  Hah, said the Red\nKnight, an echo of her speech is this.  Lo, the tale ye have made up\nbetwixt you.  But at least, having done mine errand, though meseemeth\nsomewhat leisurely, and having gotten the woman for me, thou art now\nbringing her on to the Red Hold, whatever thou hast done with her on\nthe road?  I am not, said my fellow, I am leading her away from the\nRed Hold.  Pity of thee, quoth the other, that thou hast fallen in\nwith me, and thou but half-armed.  And he raised aloft his sword; but\npresently sank it again, and let the point rest on the earth.\n\nThen he spoke again, not mockingly as erst:  A word before we end it,\nThomas:  thou hast hitherto done well by me, as I by thee.  I say\nthou hast gotten this woman, and I doubt not that at first thou hadst\nthe mind to bring her to me unminished; but then thou wert overcome\nby her beauty, as forsooth I know thee woman-mad, and thou hadst\nmeant to keep her for thyself, as forsooth I marvel not.  But in thy\nlove-making thou hast not bethought thee that keep her to thyself\nthou mayst not while I am above ground, save thou bewray me, and join\nthee to my foemen and thine.  Because I am such a man, that what I\ndesire that will I have.  For this reason, when I misdoubted me of\nthee for thy much-tarrying, I cast the sleep over thee, and have\ncaught thee.  For what wilt thou do?  Doubt it not, that if our\nswords meet, I shall pay thee for trying to take my bedthrall from me\nby taking from thee no more than thy life.  But now will I forgive\nthee all if thou wilt ride home quietly with me and this damsel-\nerrant to the Red Hold, and let her be mine and not thine so long as\nI will; and then afterwards, if thou wilt, she shall be thine as long\nas thou wilt.  Now behold, both this chance and thy life is a mere\ngift of me to thee, for otherwise thou shalt have neither damsel nor\nlife.\n\nYea, yea, said my friend, I know what thou wouldest:  I have been no\nunhandy devil to thee this long while, and thou wouldst fain keep me\nstill; but now I will be devil no longer, on this earth at least, but\nwill die and take my luck of it.  And do thou, God, see to the saving\nof this damsel, since thou hast taken the matter out of my hands.\nFarewell, dear maiden!\n\nScarce was the word out of his mouth ere his sword was in the air,\nand he smote so fierce and straight that he beat down the huge man's\nblade, and, ere he could master it again, smote the Red Knight so\nheavily on the crest that he fell to his knees; and the heart rose in\nme, for I deemed that he might yet prevail; and in as 'twere a flash\nI bethought me of the knife at my girdlestead, and drew it and ran to\nthe Red Knight, and tore aside his mail hood with one hand and thrust\nthe knife into his shoulder with the other; but so mighty was he that\nhe heeded nought the hurt, but swept his sword back-handed at the\nBlack Knight's unarmed leg, and smote him so sore a wound that down\nhe fell clattering.  Then arose the Red Knight, and thrust me from\nhim with the left hand, and strode over my fellow-farer and thrust\nhis sword through his throat.  Then he turned to me, and spake in a\nbraying voice as if a harsh horn were blown:\n\nAbide thou; if thou takest one step I will slay thee at once.  So he\nwent and sat down on a bank a little way from the dead man, and wiped\nhis sword on the grass and laid it beside him, and so sat pondering a\nwhile.  Thereafter he called me to him, and bade me stand in face of\nhim with my hands clasped before me.  Then he spake to me:  Thou art\nmy thrall and my having, since I had thus doomed it no few days ago;\nand thou art now in my hands for me to do with as I will.  Now\ninstead of being meek and obedient to me thou hast rebelled against\nme, shot an arrow at me, run from me, denied answer to my questions,\nand thrust a knife into me.  To be short, thou hast made thyself my\nfoe.  Furthermore, it is by thy doing that I have lost a right good\nservant and a trusty fellow, and one that I loved; it is thou that\nhast slain him.  Now have I been pondering what I shall do with thee.\nI said:  If I have deserved the death, then make an end and slay me\npresently; but bring me not to thine house, I pray thee.  I pray by\nthe mother that bore thee!\n\nQuoth he:  Hold thy peace, it is not what thou deservest that I am\nlooking to, but what shall pleasure me.  Now hearken; I say that thou\nhast made thee my foe, and I have overcome thee; thou art my runaway\nthrall, and I have caught thee.  As my foe I might slay thee in any\nevil way it might like me; as my thrall I might well chastise thee as\nsharply and as bitterly as I would.  But it is not my pleasure to\nslay thee, rather I will bring thee to the Red Hold, and there see\nwhat we may make of thee; whereas I cannot but deem that in thee is\nthe making of somewhat more than a thrall; and if not, then a thrall\nmust thou needs be.  Again as to the chastising of thee, that also I\nforgive thee since I have gotten the hope aforesaid.  Yet forsooth\nsome shame must I do thee to pay thee back for the love that was\nbetwixt thee and the slain man.  I will ponder what it shall be; but\ntake heed that whatsoever it shall be, it will not avail thee to pray\nme to forego it, though thy speech be as fair and sweet as thy body.\n\nTherewith he was silent a while, and I stood there not daring to\nmove, and my heart was so downcast that all the sweetness of life\nseemed departed.  Yet I withheld lamentations or prayers, thinking\nwithin myself, who knows what occasion may be between this and the\nRed Hold for my escaping; let me keep myself alive for that if it may\nbe.\n\nPresently he arose and took his sword, and went up to the slain man's\nbody and smote the head from off it.  Then he went to the two horses\nof Sir Thomas and of me, and took from them such gear of girths and\nthongs as he would, and therewith he dight me as ye saw, doing a\ngirth about my middle and making me fast to a line wherewith to hold\nme in tow.  And then he did that other thing which sickens my very\nsoul to tell of, to wit, that he took the slain man's head and tied a\nlace thereto, and hung it about my neck; and as he did so, he said:\nThis jewel shalt thou thyself bear to mine house; and there belike\nshall we lay it in earth, since the man was my trusty fellow.  Lo\nnow, this is all the ill I shall do thee till it be tried of what\navail thou art.  This is a shaming to thee and not a torment, for I\nwill ride a foot's-pace, and the green way is both soft and smooth;\nwherefore fear not that I shall throw thee down or drag thee along.\nAnd to-morrow thy shame shall be gone and we shall see what is to\nbetide.\n\nLo, friends, this is the last word he spake ere he was slain, and the\nending of my tale; for we had gone thus but a little way ere ye brake\nout of the wood upon us; and then befell the death of one friend, and\nthe doubt, maybe, of the others, and all the grief and sorrow that I\nshall never be quit of unless ye forgive me where I have done amiss,\nand help me in the days to come.  And she spread out her hands before\nthem, and bowed her head, and the tears fell from her eyes on to the\nfloor.\n\nViridis wept at Birdalone's weeping, and Aurea for her own sorrow,\nwhich this other sorrow stirred.  Atra wept not, but her face was\nsadder than weeping.\n\nBut Arthur spake and said:  Herein hath been the hand of Weird, and\nhath been heavy on us; but no blame have we to lay on our sister\nBirdalone, nor hath she done light-mindedly by us; though maybe she\nerred in not trusting to the good-hap of the Quest to bring us back\nin due time:  and all that she saith do we trow as if it were written\nin the Holy Gospel.  They all yeasaid this, and called on her to come\namongst them; but she thought of little at first save the joy of\nhearing the sweetness of those words as Arthur spake them; wherefore\nshe hung back a little, and thought shame of it that she might not\ngive more heed to the others of them.  Then came Viridis and took her\nby the hand and led her to Sir Hugh, and Birdalone knelt down before\nhim and took his hand to kiss it, but he put both hands about her\nface and kissed her kindly and merrily on the lips.  Then she knelt\nbefore Aurea, and was hapless before her; but Aurea kissed her, and\nbade her be of better cheer, albeit the words came coldly from her\nmouth.  Next she came to Arthur, and knelt before him and took his\nhand and kissed it, and thanked him kindly for his kind words,\nlooking into his face meanwhile; and she saw that it was pale and\ntroubled now, and she longed to be alone with him that she might ask\nhim wherefore.\n\nAs for Atra, she arose as Birdalone came before her, and cast her\narms about her neck, and wept and sobbed upon her bosom, and then\nwent hurrying from out the solar and into the hall, and walked to and\nfro there a while until the passion that tore her was lulled\nsomewhat, and she might show her face to them calm and friendly once\nmore.  And as she entered Arthur was speaking, and he said:\n\nTo you, ladies, I tell what we of the castle wot better than well,\nthat our dear friend hath escaped so heavy a fate in escaping the Red\nHold, that it were unmeet for us to murmur at our loss in our fellow;\nfor a warrior's life, which is ever in peril of death, is nought over\nheavy a ransom for such a friend, and so dear and lovely, from such a\nlong and evil death.  Whereas ye must wot that the said Hold hath\nthis long while been a very treasure-house of woes and a coffer of\nlamentations; for merciless was the tyrant thereof, and merciless all\nhis folk.  Now another time, when ye are stronger in heart than now\nye be, I may tell you tales thereof closer and more nicely of those\nwho did his will; as of his innermost band of men-at-arms, called the\nMillers; and of his fellow-worker in wizardry and venoms, called the\nApothecary; and the three hags, called the Furies; and the three\nyoung women, called the Graces; and his hounds that love man's flesh;\nand the like tales, as evil as nightmares turned into deeds of the\nday.  But now and here will I say this, that when we have done the\nobsequies of our dear fellow, it were good that we follow up the\nbattle so valiantly begun by him.  I mean that the Quest of our\nladies being now accomplished, we should turn what is left of the\nfellowship into a war against the Red Hold and its evil things; and\nthat so soon as the relics of Baudoin are laid in earth, we gather\nforce and go thither in arms to live or die in the quarrel, and so\nsweeten the earth, as did the men of ancient days when they slew the\ndragons and the giants, and the children of hell, and the sons of\nCain.\n\nHis cheek flushed as he spoke, and he looked around till his eyes\nfell on Birdalone, and he saw that her face also glowed and her eyes\ngleamed; but Viridis, her heart sank so that she paled, and her lips\ntrembled.\n\nBut Aurea spake and said:  I thank thee for thy word, Black Squire,\nand I know that my man shall rejoice in Paradise when he knoweth of\nit, and thereof shall I tell him to-morrow when the mass is said for\nhim.\n\nAnd Atra said:  Good is the word, and we look to it that the deed\nshall be better yet.  Thus hath the evil arisen that shall destroy\nthe evil, as oft hath been when the valiant have been grieved, and\nthe joy of the true-hearted hath been stolen from them; then the hand\ndoth the doughty deed and the heart hath ease, and solaced is sorrow.\n\nThey looked on her and wondered, for she spake with her head upraised\nand her eyes glittering, as she had been one of the wise women of\nyore agone.  And Birdalone feared her, though she loved her.\n\nLastly spake Hugh, and said:  Brother, this is well thought of\nindeed, and I marvel that I did not prevent thee; and I am thine to\nlive and die with thee.  And the adventure is nought unlikely; for if\nwe have lost a captain they have lost their head devil, and their\nhead little devil; moreover, the good men of Greenford shall join\nthem to us, and that shall make us strong, whereas they have men\nenough, and those stout men-at-arms; and artificers they have to make\nus engines, and do other wisdom; and therewithal money to buy or to\nwage what they will.  Wherefore, to my mind, we were best to make no\ntarrying, but send out the messengers for the hosting straightway.\n\nStraightway, said the Black Squire; and let us go now and find Sir\nAymeris.  So they arose both and went their ways, and left the women\nthere alone, and were gone a good while.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.  ATRA AND BIRDALONE TALK TOGETHER WHILE THE LORDS SIT\nAT THE MURDER-COUNCIL\n\n\n\nMeanwhile of their absence, Viridis sat sad and silent and downcast,\nthough she wept not, for her gladness, which erst had been so great,\nseemed now reft from her; and no merrier was Aurea, as might have\nbeen looked for.  But Atra came quietly unto Birdalone, and said\nsoftly:  I have a word for thee if thou wilt come forth with me into\nthe hall.  Birdalone's heart failed her somewhat, but she suffered\nAtra to take her hand, and they went into the hall together, and Atra\nbrought her into a shot-window, and they sat down together side by\nside and were silent awhile.  Spake Atra then, trembling and\nreddening:  Birdalone, knowest thou what thought, what hope, was in\nmy heart when I spake so proudly and rashly e'en now?  Birdalone kept\nsilence, and trembled as the other did.  This it was, said Atra:  he\nwill go to this battle valiantly, he may fall there, and that were\nbetter; for then is life to begin anew:  and what is there to do with\nthese dregs of life?  Said Birdalone, with flushed face:  If he die\nhe shall die goodly, and if he live he shall live goodly.  Yea, yea,\nsaid Atra; forsooth thou art a happy woman!  Dost thou hate me? said\nBirdalone.  Said Atra:  Proud is thy word, but I hate thee not.  Nay,\ne'en now, when I spake thus boastfully, I thought:  When he hath died\nas a doughty knight should, then, when life begins again, Birdalone\nand I shall be friends and sisters, and we two will talk together oft\nand call him to mind, and the kindness of him, and how he loved us.\nWoe's me! that was when he was there sitting beside me and I could\nsee him and his kindness; and then it was as if I could give him\naway; but now he is gone and I may not see him, it is clear to me\nthat I have no part or lot in him, and I call back my thought and my\nword, and now it is:  O that he may live!  O thou happy woman, that\nshall be glad whether he liveth or dieth!\n\nSaid Birdalone:  And now thou hatest me, dost thou not, and we are\nfoes?  Atra answered not, nor spake for a while; then she said:  Hard\nand bitter is it, and I know not what to turn to.  I have seen once\nand again, on the wall of the Minorites' church at Greenford, a fair\npicture of the Blessed, and they walking in the meads of Paradise,\nclad in like raiment, men and women; their heads flower-crowned,\ntheir feet naked in the harmless blossomed grass; hand in hand they\nwalk, with all wrath passed for ever, all desire changed into loving-\nkindness, all the anguish of forgiveness forgotten.  And underneath\nthe picture is it writ:\n\n\nBitter winter, burning summer, never more shall waste and wear;\nBlossom of the rose undying brings undying springtide there.\n\n\nO for the hope of it, that I might hope it!  O for the days to be and\nthe assuaging of sorrow:  I speak the word, and the hope springeth;\nthe word is spoken, and there abideth desire barren of hope!  And she\nbowed down her head and wept bitterly; and Birdalone called to mind\nher kindness of the past and wept for her, she also.\n\nAfter a while Atra lifted up her head, and thus she spake:  I hate\nthee not, Birdalone; nor doth one say such things to a foe.  Yea,\nfurthermore, I will crave somewhat of thee.  If ever there come a\ntime when thou mayst do something for me, thou wilt know it belike\nwithout my telling thee.  In that day and in that hour I bid thee\nremember how we stood together erst at the stair-foot of the Wailing\nTower in the Isle of Increase Unsought, and thou naked and fearful\nand quaking, and what I did to thee that tide to comfort thee and\nhelp and save thee.  And then when thou hast called it to mind, do\nthou for me what thou canst do.  Wilt thou promise this?  Yea, yea,\nsaid Birdalone; and with all the better will, that oft and over again\nhave I called it to mind.  Wherefore I behight thee to let me serve\nthee if I may whenso the occasion cometh, even if it be to my own\npain and grief; for this I know thou meanest.\n\nSee thou to this then, said Atra coldly; and thou shalt be the better\nfor it in the long run belike:  for thou art a happy woman.\n\nShe arose as she spake, and said:  Hist! here come the lords from the\nmurder-council; and lo, now that he cometh, my heart groweth evil\ntoward thee again, and well-nigh biddeth me wish that thou wert naked\nand helpless before me again.  Lo my unhap! that he should mark my\nface that it shows as if I were fain to do thee a mischief.  And\nnought of that would I do; for how should it avail me, and thou my\nfellow and the faithful messenger of the Quest?\n\nNow little of her last words did Birdalone meet, as into the hall\ncame Hugh and Arthur; and though she strove to sober her mind and\nthink of her she-friend and her unhappiness, yet she could not choose\nbut to be full of joy in her inmost heart now she knew without doubt\nthat she was so well-beloved of her beloved:  and she deemed that\nAtra was in the right indeed to call her a happy woman.\n\nSo now they all went into the solar together, and sat them down with\nthe two others; and Hugh did them to wit, how they had ordered all\nthe matter of the messengers who were to summon the knights and\nchiefs of thereabouts, and the aldermen of Greenford, to meet at the\nCastle of the Quest, that they might set afoot the hosting to go\nagainst the Red Hold.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.  HUGH TELLS THE STORY OF THE QUEST'S ENDING.\n\n\n\nWhen this was said, and there had been silence a while, Birdalone\ntook up the word, and spake meekly and sweetly, saying:  Dear\nfriends, how it fared with you on the isle from the time of my\nleaving you, and how with you, true knights, from the time of your\ndeparture, I both were fain to know for the tale's sake, and also I\nwould take the telling thereof as a sign of your forgiveness of my\ntransgression; so I would crave the same of you but if it weary you\novermuch.\n\nAll they yeasaid her kindly, and Hugh spake and said:  By your leave,\nfellows, I will tell in few words what betid us on our way to the\nIsle of Increase Unsought, and then shall Viridis take up the tale\nfrom the time that Birdalone left the said isle in the witch's ferry.\nNone said aught against it, and Hugh went on:  Short is my tale of\nthe journey:  We came to the Isle of Nothing on the morrow's morn of\nour departure, and being warned of thee, Birdalone, we abode there\nbut a little while to rest us from the boat, and went nowhither from\nthe strand, and so went on our way in a three hours' space.\n\nThence again we took the water, and came to the Isle of Kings, and\nthat was in the middle of the night:  we beheld the dead long and\nheedfully when the morning came, and departed again before noon, and\ncame to the Isle of Queens a little after nightfall.  The next\nmorning we deemed we needs must go see the images of those ladies,\nlest aught might have befell since thou wert there which might be of\nimport to the Quest, but all was unchanged, and we came away while\nthe day was yet young.\n\nWe made the Isle of the Young and the Old about sunset that day, and\nthe boy and the girl came down to the strand to behold us and wonder\nat us, and we sported with them merrily a while; and then they\nbrought us to the house of the old man, who received us courteously\nand gave us to eat and drink.  Forsooth, when the night was somewhat\nspent, he brought out strong drink to us, and took it somewhat amiss\nthat we drank not overmuch thereof, as forsooth he did, and so fell\nasleep.  Before he was drunk we asked him many questions about the\nisle and its customs, but he knew nought to tell us of them.  Of thee\nalso we asked, sister, but he had no memory of thee.\n\nOn the morrow he fared down with us to our ferry, and made many\nprayers to us to take him along with us; for here, said he, is\nneither lordship nor fair lady; and if here I abide, soon shall I\ncome to mine ending day, and sore I yearn for joyance and a long term\nto my years.  Now we durst not take him aboard lest we should fare\namiss with the wight of the Sending Boat; so we naysaid him\ncourteously, thanked him for his guesting, and gave him gifts, to\nwit, a finger gold ring and an ouch of gold, so he turned away from\nus somewhat downcast as we deemed; but ere we had given the word to\nthe Sending Boat we heard him singing merrily in a high cracked voice\nas he went on his way.\n\nNow on this last day betid somewhat of new tidings; for scarce was\nthis isle out of sight behind, ere we saw a boat come sailing toward\nus from the north-east, and it came on swiftly with a blue ripple of\nthe lake behind it.  Thereat we marvelled, and yet more when we saw\nthat its sail was striped of gold and green and black; next then were\nwe betwixt fear and joy when, as it drew nigher, we saw three women\nin the said boat, clad in gold, green, and black; and it came so nigh\nunto us at last, that we could see their faces that they were verily\nthose of our lovelings; and each reached out her arms to us and\ncalled on us for help, each by our name:  and there we were, oarless,\nsailless, at the mercy of our unkenned ferry.  Then would Baudoin and\nI have leapt overboard to swim to our loves at all adventure; but Sir\nArthur here stayed us, and bade us think of it, that we were now\nnearing the Witch-land, and if we might not look to be beset with\nguiles and gins to keep us from winning to our journey's end;\nwherefore we forbore, though in all wretchedness, and the gay boat\nran down the wind away from us, and the breeze and the ripple passed\naway with it, and the lake lay under the hot sun as smooth as glass;\nand on we went, weary-hearted.\n\nCame again another sail out of the north-east, when the sun was\ngetting low, and speedily it drew nigh, but this time it was no small\nboat or barge, but a tall ship with great sails, and goodly-towered\nshe was and shield-hung, and the basnets gleamed and the spears\nglittered from her castle-tops and bulwarks, and the sound of her\nhorns came down the wind as she neared us.  We two handled our\nweapons and did on our basnets, but Arthur there, he sat still, and\nsaid:  Not over-wise is the witch, that she lets loose on us two\nsendings in one day so like unto each other.  Hah, said Baudoin, be\nwe wary though; they are going to shoot.  And sure enough we saw a\nline of bowmen in all the castles and even along, and a horn blew,\nand then forth flew the shafts, but whither we knew not, for none\ncame anywhere anigh us; and Arthur laughed and said:  A fair shot\ninto the clouds; but, by our Lady! if none shot better in our\ncountry, I would bear no armour for their shafts.  But we two were\nconfused and knew not what to think.\n\nThe great ship flew past us on the wind as the barge had done, but\nwhen she was about half a mile aloof we saw her canvass fall to\nshivering and her yards swaying round, and Arthur cried out:  St.\nNicholas! the play beginneth again! she is coming about!\n\nEven so it was, and presently she was bearing on us, and was ere long\nso close aboard that we could see her every spar and rope, and her\nfolk all gathered to the windward, knights, sergeants, archers, and\nmariners, to gaze at us and mock us; and huge and devilish laughter\narose from amongst them as she ploughed the water so close beside us,\nthat one might well-nigh have cast a morsel of bread aboard her; for\nclear it was presently that she had no mind to run us down.\n\nSpake Arthur then:  There will be a fresh play presently, my mates,\nbut ye sit fast, for meseemeth this show is no more perilous than the\nother, though it be bigger.\n\nScarce were the words out of his mouth, ere there was a stir amongst\nthe men gathered in the waist, and lo, amidst a knot of big and\nfierce mariners, three women standing, pale, with flying hair, and\ntheir hands bound behind them, and one was clad in gold and another\nin green and the third in black; and their faces were as the faces of\nAurea and Viridis and Atra.\n\nThen there came forth from that ship a huge cruel roar blent with\nmocking laughter that shamed our very hearts, and those evil things\nin the form of mariners took hold of each one of the ladies and cast\nthem overboard into the gulf of the waters, first Aurea, next\nViridis, and then Atra; and we two stood up with our useless swords\nbrandished and would have leapt over into the deep, but that Arthur\narose also and took hold of an arm of each of us and stayed us, and\nsaid:  Nay, then, if ye go, take me with you, and let all the Quest\nsink down into the deep, and let our lovelings pine in captivity, and\nBirdalone lose all her friends in one swoop, and we be known\nhereafter as the fools of lovers, the unstable.\n\nSo we sat us down, but huge shrieking laughter rose up unblended from\nthe keel of the evil thing, and then they let her go down the wind,\nand she went her way with flashing of arms, and streaming of banners\nand pennons, and blowing of horns, and the sun was setting over the\nwide water.\n\nBut Arthur spake:  Cheer up, brethren! see ye not how this proud\nwitch is also but an eyeless fool to send us such a show, and the\nsecond time in one day to show us the images of our dearlings, who\nhours ago flitted past us in the stripe-sailed boat?  Where, then,\ndid they of the ship meet with them?  Nay, lords, let not the anguish\nof love steal all your wits.\n\nWe saw we had been fools to be so overcast by guile, and yet were we\nexceeding ill at ease, and over-long the time seemed unto us until we\nshould be come to the Isle of Increase Unsought, and find our\nlovelings there.\n\nNow was the night come, and we fell asleep, but belike were not often\nall asleep at once; and at last it was, when we felt the dawn drawing\nnear, though, the moon being down, it was the darkest of the summer\nnight, that we were all three awake, when all of a sudden we heard\njust astern the rushing of the water, as though some keel were\ncleaving it, and dimly in the dark we saw a sail as of a boat\noverhauling us.  Close at hand there rang out a lamentable cry:  O,\nare ye there, fellows of the Quest?  O, help me, friends! save me and\ndeliver me, who am snatched away to be cast into the hands of my\nmistress that was.  Help me, Baudoin, Hugh, Arthur!  Help! help!\n\nThen all we knew the voice of Birdalone, and Arthur leapt up, and\nwould have been overboard in a trice had not we two held him, and he\nfought and cursed us well-favouredly, there is no nay thereto; and\nmeanwhile the wailing voice of thee, my sister, died out in the\ndistance, and the east grew grey, and dawn was come.\n\nThen spake Baudoin:  Arthur, my brother, dost thou not mark that this\nalso was of the same sort of show as those two others, and thou who\nwert so wise before?  It is but beguilings to bring the Quest to\nnought; wherefore call to mind thy manhood and thy much wisdom!\n\nAnd we admonished him and rebuked him till he became quiet and wise\nagain, but was sad and downcast and silent.  But the Sending Boat\nsped on through the dawning, and when it was light we saw that we had\nthe Isle of Increase close aboard, and we ran ashore there just as\nthe sun was rising.  Fain were we then to get out of the boat and\nfeel earth under our feet.  We took all our hards out of the boat,\nand hid away under the roots of an old thorn a little mail wherein\nwas your raiment, my ladies, which ye had lent to Birdalone; then we\ndid on our armour, and advised us of whereabout on the isle we were,\nand we saw the orchards and gardens before us, and the great fair\nhouse above all, even as ye told us of them, Birdalone.\n\nNext, then, without more ado, we went our ways up through the orchard\nand the gardens, and when we were well-nigh at the end of them, and\nin face of those many steps ye spake of, we saw at the foot of them a\ntall woman clad in red scarlet, standing as if she abode our coming.\nWhen we drew nigh we saw that she was strong-looking, well-knit,\nwhite-skinned, yellow-haired, and blue-eyed, and might have been\ncalled a fair woman, as to her shaping, save that her face was heavy,\nyet hard-looking, with thin lips and somewhat flagging cheeks, a face\nstupid, but proud and cruel.\n\nShe hailed us as we came up, and said:  Men-at-arms, ye be welcome to\nour house, and I bid you to eat and drink and abide here.\n\nThen we louted before her, and bade her Hail; and Baudoin said:\nLady, thy bidding will we take; yet have we an errand to declare ere\nwe break bread with thee, lest when it is told we be not so welcome\nas ye tell us now.  What is it? said she.  Said Baudoin:  This man\nhere is called the Green Knight, and this the Black Squire, and I am\nthe Golden Knight; and now will we ask thee if this isle be called\nthe Isle of Increase Unsought?  Even so have I called it, quoth she,\nwherefore I deem none other will dare call it otherwise.  It is well,\nquoth Baudoin; but we have heard say that hereto had strayed three\ndear friends of ours, three maidens, who hight Viridis, the friend of\nthe Green Knight, and Atra, who is the Black Squire's, and Aurea, who\nis mine own friend, so we have come to take them home with us, since\nthey have been so long away from their land and their loves.  Now if\nthey be thy friends thou wilt perchance let them go for love's sake\nand the eking of friendship; but if they be thy captives, then are we\nwell willing to pay thee ransom, not according to their worth, for no\ntreasure heaped up might come nigh it, but according to thy desire,\nlady.\n\nLaughed the proud lady scornfully and said:  Big are thy words, Sir\nKnight:  if I had these maidens in my keeping I would give them unto\nyou for nothing, and deem that I had the best of the bargain.  But\nhere are they not.  True it is that I had here three thralls who were\nhight as thou hast said; but a while ago, not many days, they\ntransgressed against me till I chastised them; and then was I weary\nof them and would be quit of them; for I need no servants here,\nwhereas I myself am enough for myself.  Wherefore I sent them away\nacross the water to my sister, who dwells in a fair place hight the\nHouse under the Wood; for she needeth servants, because the earth\nthere yieldeth nought save to the tiller and the herdsman and the\nhunter, while here all cometh unsought.  With her may ye deal, for\nwhat I know, and buy the maidens whom ye prize so high; though belike\nye may have to give her other servants in their place.  For, indeed,\na while ago her thrall fled from her and left her half undone, and it\nis said that she came hither in her shamelessness:  but I know not;\nif she did, she slipped through my fingers, or else I would have made\nher rue her impudence.  Now meseemeth, Sir Knights, here is enough of\nso small and foolish a matter; and again I pray you to enter my poor\nhouse, and take meat and drink along with me, for ye be none the less\nwelcome because of your errand, though it be a foolish one.\n\nNow would Sir Baudoin have answered wrathfully, but Arthur plucked at\nhis skirt, and he yeasaid the lady's bidding, though somewhat\nungraciously; but that she heeded nought; she took Sir Baudoin by the\nhand and led him up the stately perron, and thence came we into a\npillared hall, as fair as might be.  And there on the dais was a\ntable dight with dainty meats and drinks, and the lady bade us\nthereto, and we sat to it.\n\nThereat was the lady buxom and merry:  Baudoin scowled across the\nboard; I was wary and silent; but Arthur was as blithe with the lady\nas she with him; nor did I altogether marvel thereat, since I knew\nhim wise of wit.\n\nBut when we were done with the meal, the lady stood up and said:\nNow, Sir Knights, I will give you leave; but this house is as your\nown to roam through all its chambers and pleasure you with its\nwonders and goodliness; and when ye are weary of the house, then is\nthe orchard and the garden free to you, and all the isle wheresoever\nye will go.  And here in this hall is meat and drink for you whenso\nye will; but if ye would see me again to-day, then shall ye meet me\nwhere ye first happened on me e'en now, at the foot of the great\nperron.\n\nThen she laid her hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said:  Thy big\nfriend may search out every nook in this house, and every bush in the\nwhole island, and if he find there the maidens he spake of, one or\nall of them, then are they a gift from me unto him.\n\nTherewith she turned, and went out of the hall by a door in the side\nthereof; and now already meseemed that though the woman was hateful\nand thick-hearted and cruel, yet she was become fairer, or seemed so,\nthan when we first came on her; and for my part I pondered on what it\nmight grow to, and fear of her came into my soul.\n\nNow spake Baudoin:  Fellows, let us get out into the garden at least;\nfor this place is evil, and meseems it smells and tastes of tears and\nblood, and that evil wights that hate the life of men are lurking in\nthe nooks thereof.  And lo, our very she-friend that was so kind and\nsimple and dainty with us, there is, as it were, the image of the\ndear maiden standing trembling and naked before the stupid malice of\nthis lump of flesh.  So spake he, Birdalone.\n\nBut I said to Arthur in a soft voice:  And when shall we slay her?\nSaid he:  Not until we have gotten from her all that may be gotten;\nand that is the living bodies of our friends.  But come we forth.\n\nSo did we, and came down to the orchard and did off our helms, and\nlay down under a big apple-tree which was clear of cover all round\nabout, and so fell to our redes; and I asked Arthur what he deemed of\nthe story of our loves having been carried to the House under the\nWood, and if it might not be tried seeking thither; but he laughed\nand said:  Never would she have told us thereof had it been sooth:\ndoubtless our friends are here on this isle, but, as I deem, not in\nthe house, else had not the witch left all the house free for us to\nsearch into.  Yea, said I, but how if they be in her prison?  Said\nhe:  It is not hard to find out which is the prison of so dainty a\nhouse as is yonder; and when we had found it, soon should we have hit\nupon a way to break it, since we be three, and stout fellows enough.\nNay, I deem that the lovelings be stowed away in some corner of the\nisle without the house, and that mayhappen we shall find them there;\nand yet I trow not before we have made guile meet guile, and overcome\nthe sorceress.  But come now, let us be doing, and begin to quarter\nthis little land as the kestrel doth the water-meadow; and leave we\nour armour, lest we weary us, for we shall have no need for hard\nstrokes.\n\nWe hung up there on the tree helm and shield and hauberk, and all our\ndefences, and went our ways quartering the isle; and the work was\ntoilsome, but we rested not till the time was come to keep tryst with\nthe lady; and all that while we found no sign of the darling ones:\nand the isle was everywhere a meadow as fair as a garden, with little\ncopses of sweet-growing trees here and there, and goodly brooks of\nwater, but no tillage anywhere:  wild things, as hart and buck and\nroe, we came upon, and smaller deer withal, but all unhurtful to man;\nbut of herding was no token.\n\nCame we then back to that lordly perron, and there, at the foot\nthereof, stood the witch-wife, and received us joyously; clad was she\nall gloriously in red scarlet broidered and begemmed; her arms bare\nand her feet sandalled, and her yellow hair hanging down from under\nits garland; and certainly it was so that she had grown fairer, and\nwas sleek and white and well-shapen, and well-haired; yet by all\nthat, the visage of her was little bettered, and unto me she was\nloathsome.\n\nNow the feast went much as the earlier meal had done; and Baudoin was\nsurly and Arthur blithe and buxom; and nought befell to tell of, save\nthat dishes and meats, and flasks and cups, and all things came upon\nthe board as if they were borne thereon by folk unseen; and thereat\nwe wondered not much, considering in what wonder-house we were.  But\nthe lady-witch looked on us and smiled, and said:  Knights, ye marvel\nat the manner of our service, but call to mind that we told you this\nmorning that we were enough for Ourselves, and we have so dight our\ndays here that whoso is our friend on this Isle of Increase shall\nlack nothing.  Fear not, therefore, to see aught ugly in our servants\nas now unseen, if their shapes were made manifest unto you.\n\nAll things were we heedful to note at this banquet; but when it was\nover, then came music into the hall from folk unseen, but not as if\nthe musicians were a many, only belike some three or four.  And\nthereat the lady spake, saying:  Knights, ye may deem our minstrels\nbut few, but such is our mind that we love not our music overloud,\nand for the most part only three sing or play unto us at one time.\n\nThereafter the lady brought us to fair chambers, and we slept there\nin all ease, and we arose on the morrow and found the lady still\nblithe with us; yet I noted this, that she seemed to deal with Arthur\nas if she saw him now for the first time, and much he seemed to be to\nher liking.\n\nAgain we fared forth, and were no less diligent in searching the isle\nthan erst, and found nought; and all went that day as before.\n\nOn the morrow (that is, the third day) the witch seemed to have\nsomewhat more memory of Arthur than erst, and even yet more liking of\nhim, so that she reached out her hand for him to kiss, which needs\nmust he do, despite his loathing of her.\n\nWhen we had lain under the apple-tree a little while, Baudoin spake\nand said:  Yesterday and the day before we searched the open land and\nfound nought; now to-day let us search the house, and if we find\nnought, then at least it shall lie behind us.  We yeasaid it, and\npresently went back, and from chamber to chamber, and all was fair\nand goodly as might be, and we marvelled what would betide to it when\nthe witch was undone and her sorcery come to an end.\n\nTo the Wailing Tower we came, and up the stairs, and found the door\nopen of the prison-chamber, and all there as thou hast told us,\nBirdalone; only we opened the great coffer, whence thou didst refrain\nthee, and found it full of hideous gear truly, as fetters and chains,\nand whips and rods, and evil tools of the tormentors, and cursed it\nall and came away; and Arthur said:  Lo you, this stupid one!  How\neager is she to bid us what to do, and to tell us that our ladies are\nnot in this evil house, since she leaveth all open to us.  Yet we\nwent about the house without, and counted the windows heedfully to\nsee that we had missed no chamber, and found nought amiss; and then\nwe went in again and sought as low down as we might, to see if\nperchance some dungeon there were underground, but found nought save\na very goodly undercroft below the great hall, which was little less\nfair than that which was above it.  So came the evening and the\nbanquet, and the end of that day; but the witch-wife led Arthur by\nthe hand to the board, and afterwards to the chamber ere we slept.\n\nOn the fourth day and the fifth it was no otherwise than erst; and\nwhen I fared to bed I felt confused in my head and sick of heart.\n\nThe night of the next day (the sixth), as we went to our chambers,\nand the witch-wife and Arthur hand-in-hand, she stayed him a while,\nand spake eagerly to him in a soft voice; and as he came up to me\nafterwards he said:  To-night I have escaped it, but there will not\nbe escape for long.  From what? said I.  He said:  From bedding her;\nfor now it has come to this, that presently we must slay her at once\nand have no knowledge of our sweetlings, or I must do her will.\n\nIn such wise passed four more days, and it was the twelfth morning of\nour sojourn there, and we went forth on our search of every mead and\nevery covert of the isle, and all day we found nought to our purpose;\nbut as it grew toward sunset, and there grew great clouds in the\neastern ort, piled up and copper-coloured, we came over a bent on to\na little green dale watered by a clear brook, and as we looked down\ninto it we saw something shine amongst its trees; so we hastened\ntoward that gleam, and lo, amidst the dale, with the brook running\nthrough it, a strange garth we saw.  For there was a pavilion done of\ntimber and board, and gaily painted and gilded, and out from that\nhouse was, as it were, a great cage of thin gilded bars, both walls\nand roof, just so wide apart as no one full-grown, carl or quean,\ncould thrust through.\n\nThitherward then ran we, shouting, for we saw at once that in the\nsaid cage were three women whose aspect was that of our sweetlings,\nand presently we were standing by the said herse, reaching our hands\nout to them to come to us and tell us their tale, and that we would\ndeliver them.  But they stood together in the midst of the said cage,\nand though they gazed piteously on us thence, and reached out their\nhands to us, they neither spake nor came to the herse to us; so we\ndeemed that they were bewitched, and our joy was dashed.\n\nThen we went all about the cage and the pavilion to find ingate, and\nfound it not; and then the three of us together strove with the bars\nof the herse, and shook and swayed them, but it was all to no\npurpose.\n\nMoreover, while we were at this work the sun seemed to go out, and\nthere came a heavy black mist rolling into the dale, and wrapped us\nabout so that we saw not each other's faces, and the bars of the\nherse were gone from our hands as we stood there.  Then came rain and\nthunder and lightning on to the black night, and by the glare of the\nlightning we could see the leaves and grass of the dale, but neither\nherse nor house nor woman.  So we abode there in the dark night, and\nthe storm all bewildered us, till the rain and clouds drew off and it\nwas calm fair starlight again, but clean gone was the golden cage and\nthey that stood therein; and we turned sadly, and went our ways\ntoward the witch-house.\n\nOn the way said Arthur:  Brethren, this meseemeth is but a-going on\nwith the shows which were played us on the water as we came hither;\nbut whether she doth this but for to mock and torment us, or that she\nwould beguile us into deeming that our friends are verily here, I wot\nnot; but to-morrow, meseemeth, I shall can to tell you.\n\nNow came we to the perron of the house, and there stood the witch-\nwife under the stars to meet us.  And when she saw us, she took hold\nof Arthur by the hand and the arm to caress him, and found that he\nand we were drenched with the rain and the storm, as might well be\ndeemed; then she bade us up to our chambers to do on raiment which\nshe had dight for us, and we went thither, and found our garments\nrich and dainty indeed; but when we came down into the hall where the\nwitch abode us, we saw that Arthur's raiment was far the richest and\ndaintiest.  But the witch ran to him and cast her arms about him, and\nclipped and kissed him before the others, and he suffered it.  So\nsped the feast again.\n\nBut when they went to bed, the said witch took Arthur's hand and\nspake a word unto him, and led him away, and he went with her as one\nnought loth; but we twain were afraid lest she should destroy him\nwhen she had had her will of him.  Wherefore we waked through the\nmore part of the night with our swords ready to hand.\n\nBut when we were clad in the morn he came unto us, he also clad, and\nwas downcast and shamefaced indeed, but safe and sound; and he said:\nSpeak no word about our matter till we be out in the open air, for I\nfear all things about us.\n\nSo when we had gone forth and were under the apple-tree once more,\nspake Arthur:  Now, lords, am I shamed for ever, for I have become\nthe leman of this evil creature; but I pray ye not to mock me; and\nthat the more as the same lot may happen on you both, or either; for\nI can see for sure that the wretch will weary of me and desire one of\nyou two.  Let it pass.  Somewhat have I found out from her, but not\nmuch; first, that she has forgotten her first lie, to wit, how she\nsent our ladies to the sister-witch; for I told her of the golden\ncage, and how we had missed it in the storm; and she said:  Though I\ndeem it a folly that ye should seek these thralls, yet would I help\nyou if I might, since ye are now become my dear friends.  Though,\nforsooth, when ye meet them I deem that ye will find them sore\nchanged to you.  For, as I told you, they fled away from me, after I\nhad chastised them for a treason, into the hidden places of the isle,\nwhereas they had no keel to sail away hence.  And I cared not to\nfollow them, as I myself am queen and lady of all things here, and am\nenough for myself, save when love constraineth me, dear lord.  Now,\nmy rede is that ye seek the golden cage again and yet again, because\nI deem that these thralls have somehow learned some wisdom, and they\nhave enchanted the said cage for a defence against me, from whom they\nmight not hide as they did from you; for of me have they stolen their\nwizardry, and I am their mistress therein.\n\nThis, therefore, is the new lie of her, and my rede is that we heed\nit nought.  For my mind is that she it is that hath made the\nappearance of the cage and the women therein, and that she hath our\npoor friends somewhere underneath her hand.\n\nNow this we deemed most like; yet whereas we had nought to do with\nthe time, which, now that we had searched the isle throughly, hung\nheavy on hand, we deemed it good to go to the dale of the golden cage\nagain, though we looked not to find the cage there any more.  But\nthis betid, that we found the little dale easily enough, and there\nstood the cage as we had seen it yesterday, but nought was there\nwithin its bright bars save the grass and the flowers, and the water\nof the brook a-running.\n\nWe loitered about that place a while, and went back to the house in\ndue time; and to shorten the tale, I shall tell that for many days it\nbetid that we went every day to seek the golden cage, but after the\nfirst three days we saw it no more.\n\nNow began sadness and weariness to overcome us as the days and weeks\nwore, and belike the witch-wife noted it that we were worse company\nthan heretofore.\n\nAnd now on a day Arthur bade us note that the said witch was growing\nweary of him, and he bade me look to it; for, said he, she is turning\nher face toward thee, brother.  My heart burned with rage at that\nword; I said nought, but made up my mind that I would try to bring\nthe matter to an end.\n\nThat same night befell what Arthur had threatened; for the feast\nbeing done in the evening, the witch drew me aside while the music\nwas a-playing, and caressed my hand and my shoulder, and said:  I am\nyet wondering at you Champions, that ye must needs follow after those\nthree wretched thralls, whom never will ye find, for they. need ye\nnot, but will flee from you if ye have sight of them, as they did\nthat other day; and therein they are scarce in the wrong, whereas\nthey may well think that if ye find them they should fall into my\nhands; for easily may I take them any day that I will, and then I\nhave a case against them, and may lawfully chastise them according to\nthe law that has been given unto me; and then shall they be in\ngrievous plight.  Wherefore the rede We give unto you three now is\nthe rede of friendliness that ye make yourselves happy in Our Island,\nand then will We do everything We may for your pleasure and delight;\nand if ye will that We make Ourselves even fairer than now We be,\nthat may be done, and shall be a reward unto you for your yielding\nand obedience.  And if ye will women thralls for your pleasure, that\nalso may be gotten for you; for We be not wholly without power in\nthese waters, though We have no keel or ferry upon them.  And now,\nthou fair lad, We give thee this last word:  Ye Champions have been\ndwelling in Our house a long while, and that while have ever striven\nto thwart Us.  We now counsel you to make an end of it, and it shall\nbe better for you.\n\nShe seemed to my eyes prouder and stupider than ever erst, despite\nher golden hair and white skin and lovely limbs; and I said to myself\nthat now must we destroy the evil of that house even if we died for\nit, or else we were all undone; withal I saw somewhat of truth\nthrusting up through her much lying, and I deemed, even as Arthur\ndid, that she had our friends under her band somewhere.\n\nNought else betid that night; but on the morrow we went forth and\nstrayed on till we were come into the southernmost quarter of the\nisle, and not very far from the water we came upon a wood or big\nthicket which was new to us.  So we entered it, and as we went and\nnoted the wild things of the wood going hither and thither, we espied\nafar off the shape of a man going amidst the thicket; wherefore we\nwent warily towards him, lest he should see us and flee from us; and\nwhen we drew a little nigher we saw it was a woman, though she was\nclad as a hunter, with legs naked to above the knee.  She had a\nquiver at her back and a bow in her hand, and her coat was black of\nhue.  Belike now she heard our going amongst the dry leaves, for she\nturned her face to us, and lo! it was the face of Atra.\n\nWhen she saw us, she gave a shrill cry, and fell to running at her\nswiftest away from us, and we followed all we might, but we could not\nover-run her, though we kept her in sight ever, till we had run all\nthrough the wood, and before us was the sheer side of a rocky hill\nand the mouth of a cave therein, and by the said mouth who should\nthere be but Aurea and Viridis, as we thought, clad in gold and in\ngreen, but the fashion of their raiment not otherwise than Atra's.\nTheir bows were bended and they had shafts in their hands, and as we\ncame out of the thicket into the open lawn before the cave, Viridis\nnocked a shaft and aimed at us and drew, and the shaft flew over my\nhead; therewith mocking laughter came from them, and they ran into\nthe cave.  Speedily we ran up to it, but when we came home thither,\nthere was the sheer hillside, but never a cave nor an opening.\n\nDismayed were we thereat; but more dismayed had we been but that we\ndeemed that all this was but a cheat and a painted show put upon us\nby the witch to back up her lying.  Nevertheless we fared the next\nday to seek the wood and the cave in the sheer rock, but nowise might\nwe find either wood or cave.\n\nNow it was the night of the day hereafter, as we went to our\nchambers, that the witch-wife took me by the hand and led me apart,\nand said me many soft things of her accursed lust, whereof I will not\nsay one again.  But the upshot of it all was that she would bring me\nto her chamber and her bed.  And whereas I was determined what to do,\nand had my war-sword by my side, I naysaid her not, but made her good\ncountenance.  And when we came to her chamber, which was full\ngloriously dight, and fragrant as with the scent of the roses and\nlilies of mid-June, she bade me to lie in her bed of gold and ivory\nand she would be with me anon.  So I unclad myself and laid me down,\nbut I drew forth my sword, and laid the ancient naked blade betwixt\nmy side and her place.\n\nAnon she cometh back again unclad, and would step into the bed; but\nshe saw the sword and said:  What is this, Champion?  Said I:  These\nedges are the token of sundering between us, for there is a spell on\nme, that with no woman may I deal, save with mine only love, but I\nshall do her mortal scathe; so beware by the token of the grey edges\nof battle.  She drew aback, and was as a spiteful and angry cat, and\nthere was no loveliness in her; and she said:  Thou liest, and thou\nhatest me; see thou to it, both for thyself and thy loveling.  And\nshe turned about and strode out of the chamber; but I arose and clad\nmyself in haste, and took my naked sword in my hand.  But before I\nwent, I looked around, and espied an ambry fashioned in the wall of\nthe bed-lane, and the door was half open; and the said ambry was\nwrought of the daintiest, all of gold and pearl and gems; and I said\nto myself:  Herein is some treasure, and this is a tide of war.  So I\nopened the ambry, and within it was even more gloriously wrought than\nwithout; and there was nought therein, save a little flask of crystal\ndone about with bands of gold set with great and goodly gems.  So I\ntook the said flask and went my ways hastily to my own chamber, and\nthere I looked at the said flask and took out the stopple; and there\nwas a liquor therein, white like to water, but of a spicy smell,\nsweet, fresh, and enheartening.  So I yet thought this was some great\ntreasure, and that much hung upon it, could I find out unto what use\nit might be put.  And I said:  To-morrow we will put it to the proof.\nThen I put the said flask under my pillow, and laid my sword by my\nside and slept, and was not ill-content so far.\n\nBut on the morrow, when I met my fellows, they asked me how I had\nsped, and I told them, Well, and that we would talk the matter over\nunder our tree of counsel.  So we went down into the hall, where we\nmet the witch-lady; and I looked for it that she would be angry and\nfierce with me; but it went far otherwise; for she was blithe and\nbuxom, and abounding in endearments more than I could away with.  But\nthis I noted, that her eyes wandered, and her speech faltered at\nwhiles, and ever she seemed to be seeking somewhat; and withal that\nher caressing hands were seeking if they could aught stowed away in\nthe bosom of my coat.  But all was nought, for as we came to the door\nof the hall I gave Baudoin the flask to guard until we should come to\nour apple-tree of rede.  Wherefore the she-wolf went red and white by\nturns, and fumed, and fretted her bedizenments with unrestful hands,\nand when she should let us go our ways, she lingered and looked back\noft, and was loth to depart ere she had gotten what she lacked, and\nthat, forsooth, was the said flasket.\n\nBut when we were without the house, I bade our fellows go with me to\nanother place than the wonted apple-tree of rede, and they understood\nmy word, and I led them to a little grassy plain without the orchard,\nwhere was no covert for a wide space about it, nought but the one\nlinden-tree under which now we sat.  There I told them all the tale\nof the last night and of the flasket, and put before them all that\nwas in my mind to do that evening at the banquet, and they both of\nthem yeasaid it.  But what it was, that shall ye hear anon when we\ncarried the matter through; but I bade Baudoin still carry the\nflasket till the evening.\n\nThereafter we spake of other matters; but soon we had good cause to\nrejoice that we had not talked our talk under the apple-tree (whereas\nI doubted not that the witch would spy upon us there), for not long\nhad we been at our talk ere, looking that way, we saw the evil\ncreature by the hedge of the orchard and gazing over at us.\n\nWe arose then, and came to her as if nought had happened; and she\nbade us walk the garden with her, and we yeasaid it, and went with\nher, and paced about amidst the flowers and lay on the blossomed\ngrass.  Forsooth, both to her and to us the time hung heavy on hand.\nAnd meseemed that the sleekness and fairness of her body was worsened\nsince yesterday, and she was pale and haggard, and her eyes were\nwandering and afraid.\n\nNow she bade us come a little further into the garden and eat a\nmorsel at noon; and we arose, and she brought us to where were vines\ntrellised all about and overhead, so that it was like a fair green\ncloister; and there was a board laid and spread with many dainties of\nmeat and drink.  And she bade us sit.  Verily we had but little\nstomach to that dinner; and I said to myself, Poison! poison! and\neven so my fellows deemed, as afterwards they told me.  And I saw\nBaudoin loosen his sword in the sheath, and I knew that his mind was\nto smite at once if he saw aught amiss.  And I, who sat next to the\nwitch, laid my hand on a little dagger which I wore at my girdle.\nShe also saw this, and turned as pale as death, and sat trembling\nbefore us; and whatso we ate or drank at that board under the\nrustling vine-leaves, she gave unto us with her own hand; and then we\nwotted full surely that she had meant our deaths there and then, but\nwas cowed by the fierce eyes of Baudoin and the threat of my hand.\n\nWithal it seemed that she might not bear it to sit there long amongst\nus.  She rose up and smiled on us as ghastly as a corpse, and gave us\nleave, and went hurrying into the house.  And right glad we were to\nbe at rest from her.  Yet as we ourselves durst not go far away from\nthe house, lest some new thing might happen, neither could she leave\nus quite alone, but thrice again that afternoon at some turn of the\ngarden, or orchard, or meadow, we came upon her wan face and eyes\nfull of all hate and staring pride, and she enforced her to smile\nupon us, and turned away with some idle word.\n\nAt last the sun began to sink, and we went to the perron of the\nhouse, and found her standing to meet us in her wonted way.  But when\nwe came up she gave no hand to any one of us but went up the stairs\nbefore us, and we followed with no word spoken.\n\nThere was the hall with the lordly service on the board, and the wax-\ncandles lighted all about, and the great vault of stone fair and\nstately over it.  We went to the dais and the board and sat down, the\nwitch-wife in her gold and ivory chair at the board's end, and I at\nher right hand and looking down the hall, my two fellows facing me,\nwith their backs to the clear of the hall.\n\nThere we sat, and the meats and drinks were before us as dainty as\never erst; but we put forth no hand to them, but sat staring at each\nother for some two minutes it might be, and the witch looked from one\nto the other of us, and quaked that her hands shook like palsy.\n\nThen I rose up and put my hand to my bosom (for Baudoin had given me\nthe flasket ere we came to the perron):  I spake in a loud voice, and\nit sounded wild and hard in the goodly hall:  My lady, I said, thou\nart looking but pale now, and sick and downcast.  Drink now to me out\nof this precious flasket, and thou shalt be whole and well.\n\nAnd therewith I held the flasket aloft; but her face changed\nhorribly; she sprang up in her chair and reached out her arm to\nclutch at the flasket, screaming like an eagle therewith.  But I\nthrust her back into the chair with my left hand; and therewith arose\nBaudoin and Arthur, and caught her by the shoulders, and bound her\nfast to the chair with cords that they had gotten thereto.  But when\nshe got her breath she yelled out:  Ah, now shall all tumble\ntogether, my proudful house and I under it!  Loose me, traitors!\nloose me, fools! and give me one draught of the water of might, and\nthen shall I tell you all, and ye shall go free with your thralls if\nye will.  Ah! ye will not loose me? ye will not?  Well then, at least\nye, the fools, shall be under it, and they also, the she-traitors,\nthe scourged and tormented fools that might not save themselves from\nme.  O loose me! loose me! thou in whose arms I have lain so many a\nnight, and give me to drink of the proud water of might!\n\nSo she yelled; and now had all the fairness gone from her body:\nflaggy and yellow were her limbs, and she looked all over as her\nface, a lump of stupid and cruel pride, and her words lost meaning\nand changed into mere bestial howling.  But for me, since she so\ndesired that water, I knew that it was good for us to drink, and I\ntook out the stopple and drank, and it was as if fire ran through all\nmy veins, and I felt my strength three-folded straightway, and most\nwondrous clear was my sight grown therewith; and I raised my eyes now\nand looked down the hall, and lo, there was Aurea, chained by the\nankle to the third pillar from the dais; and over against her,\nViridis; and next, to the fourth pillar, Atra.  Then I cried in a\nloud voice that rang through the witch's hall:  Lo what I see!  And I\nran round the head of the board, and thrust and dragged Baudoin and\nArthur along with me, crying out:  Come, come! they are found! they\nare here!  And I came to my sweetling, and found her clad but in her\nwhite smock, which was flecked with blood all about, and her face was\nwan and pined, and the tears began to run when she saw me, but no\nword came from her lips though the kissing of them was sweet.\n\nThen I turned about to my two fellows, and they stood bewildered, not\nknowing what was toward; and I came to them and made them drink of\nthe flasket, and their eyes were opened and the strength of giants\ncame to them, and they ran each to his sweetling; but Baudoin, before\never he kissed Aurea, caught hold of the chain that bound her to the\npillar, and by main force dragged it out.  Wise was that, meseemed,\nfor words were again come into the witch's howls, and I heard her:\nAh, long may ye be playing with the chains, long! for now the house\nrumbleth toward its fall.  Ah, the bitches are loose!  Woe's me! to\ndie alone!  And once more she howled wordless, as both I and Arthur\nhad our loves in our arms, and fell to following Baudoin out on to\nthe perron and down into the fresh fragrant garden wherein now was\nthe moon beginning to cast shadows.\n\nStood we then aloof from the house, and the rumbling whereof the evil\nhag had howled waxed into a thunder, and under our very eyes the\ngreat white walls and gold-adorned roofs fell together, and a great\ncloud of dust rose under the clear moonlit sky.\n\nWe looked and wondered, and our loves also, but no word they spake;\nbut ere the other two had time to grieve thereat, I gave Viridis to\ndrink of the water of might, and she fell to sweet speech\nstraightway, of such sort and such wise as I will not tell you.  Then\nI did the same by Aurea and Atra, and forthwith the speech flowed\nfrom them to their friends.\n\nFull happy were we then in the early night-season, for the water of\nmight gave them strength also, as to us, and healed all the stripes\nand wounds their bodies had suffered of the foul witch, and made\ntheir eyes bright, and their cheeks full and firm, and their lips\nmost sweet, and their hands strong and delicious.\n\nNow when we had stood gazing toward the melting of the beauteous\npalace for a little, we took our darlings in our arms again, whereas\nthe chains would have hindered their walking, and went down to the\nlip of the water whereas lay the Sending Boat, so that we might be\nanigh our ferry in case of need; for we knew not what might betide\nthe isle now its mistress had perished.  Then we fell to and sawed\noff the chains from the dear ankles with our swords, and took\nBirdalone's lendings from the mail.  And Aurea had her gown again,\nand Viridis her smock, and my green surcoat over it, and Atra wore\nthe battle-coat of the Black Squire.  As for their bare feet (for\nAtra would not have hers dight prouder than her sisters'), we so clad\nthem with kisses that they were not ill-covered belike.\n\nSo gat we aboard our ferry, and did blood-offering to the wight\nthereof, and so sped merrily and lovingly over the wide lake back on\nour homeward road.  And we said:  This hath the dear Birdalone done\nfor us.\n\nAnd now, my Viridis, I will that thou fill up the tale by telling to\nBirdalone, as ye told us, how it fared with you three and the evil\none from the time that ye sped Birdalone on her way till the moment\nwhen mine eyes first beheld you made fast to the pillars of the\npalace which has crumbled into dust.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.  HOW IT FARED WITH THE THREE LADIES AFTER THE ESCAPE OF\nBIRDALONE\n\n\n\nViridis took up the word without more ado, and said:  I will do my\nbest herein, and ye, sisters, must set me right if I err.  When we\nhad seen the last of you, dear Birdalone, that early morning, we\nturned back again to the house as speedily and as covertly as we\nmight, lest the witch might espy our disarray and question us\nthereover.  Then we went to the wonder-coffer, and gat thereout\nraiment for that which we had given away, which was easy for us to\ndo, whereas the witch-mistress was so slothful that she had given to\nus the words of might wherewith to compel the coffer to yield, so\nthat we might do all the service thereof, and she not to move hand or\nfoot in the matter.  So when we were clad, and the time was come, we\nwent into the hall, by no means well assured of our mistress.\n\nWhen we came before her, she looked on us in surly wise, as her wont\nwas, and said nought for a while; she stared on us and knit her\nbrows, as if she strove to call to mind something that ran to and fro\nin her memory; and I noted that, and for my part I trembled before\nher.  But she spake at last:  Meseemeth as if there is a woman in the\nisle besides you three; some misdoer that I was minded to punish.\nTell me, you! was there not a naked one who came into this hall a\nwhile ago, one whom I threatened with pining?  Atra, who was the\nboldest of us, bowed the knee before her, and said:  Nay, our lady,\nsince when do stranger women come naked into thine hall, and dare\nthee there?\n\nSaid the witch:  Yet have I an image of a naked woman standing down\nthere before me; and if I have it in mine eye, so should ye.  Tell me\ntherefore, and beware, for We are not bidden to hold Our hand from\nyou if We take you in misdeeds.\n\nIf I quaked before, now much more I quaked, till my legs well-nigh\nfailed me for fear; but Atra said:  Great lady, this image will\nbelike be of that one whom a while ago ye had stripped and tied to a\npillar here, and tormented while ye feasted.\n\nThe lady looked on her hard, and again seemed striving to gather up\nthe thrums of some memory, and then her face became smooth again, and\nshe spake lightly:  All that may well be; so do ye go about your due\nservice, and trouble Our rest here no longer; for We love not to look\non folk who be not wholly Our own to pine or to spare, to slay or let\nlive, as We will; and We would that the winds and the waves would\nsend Us some such now; for it is like to living all alone to have but\nsuch as you with Us, and none to cower before Us and entreat Us of\nmercy.  So begone, I bid you.\n\nThus for that time were we saved from the witch's cruelty; but our\ntime came before long.  The days wore heavily, nor kept we count of\nthem lest we should lose heart for the weariness of waiting.  But on\na day as we stood on the steps of the perron and served my lady with\ndainties, of a hot afternoon, came two great white doves a-flying,\nwho pitched down right before our mistress's feet; and each had a\ngold ring about his neck, and a scroll tied thereto, and the witch\nbade us take the doves and take off the scrolls and give them unto\nher; and she looked on the gold rings which the doves bore, and for a\nmoment on the scrolls, and then she said:  Take ye the doves and\ncherish them, lest We have need of them; take also the two scrolls\nand keep them till to-morrow morning, and then give them into Our\nhands.  And look ye to this, that if ye give them not unto Us it will\nbe treason against Us, and We shall have a case against you, and your\nbodies will be Ours.\n\nThen she rose up slowly, and bade me to her that she might lean upon\nmy shoulder and be helped upstairs, so slothful a beast as she was;\nand as we went up I heard her say softly to herself:  Weary on it,\nnow must I drink a sup of the Water of Might, that I may remember and\ndo and desire.  But dear is my sister, and without doubt she hath\nmatters of import to tell me by these doves.\n\nSo when we were together alone I told the others hereof, and we\ntalked it over; and they deemed the tidings ill, even as I did; for\nwe might not doubt but that the doves were a sending from the witch-\nsister who dwelt at the House under the Wood; and sore we misdoubted\nthat they were sped to our mistress to tell her of thee, Birdalone,\nand mayhappen of the Quest, so wise as we knew she was.  As to the\ntwo scrolls, forsooth, they were open, and not sealed; but when we\nlooked on them we could make nought of it; for though they were writ\nfairly in Latin script, so that we read them, yet of the words no\nwhit might we understand, so we feared the worst.  But what might we\ndo? we had but two choices, either to cast ourselves into the water,\nor abide what should befall; and this last one we chose because of\nthe hope of deliverance.\n\nNext morning, therefore, we came before our mistress in the hall, and\nwe found her pacing up and down before the dais; though her wont was\nat that hour to be sitting in her throne of gold and ivory, lying\nback on the cushions half asleep.\n\nSo Atra went up to her, and knelt before her and gave her the\nscrolls, and she looked on her grimly, and smiled evilly, and said:\nKneel there yet; and ye others kneel also, till I see what befitteth\nyou.  So did we, and indeed I was fain to kneel, for I might scarce\nstand up for terror; and all of us, our hearts died within us.\n\nBut the witch read those scrolls to herself, sitting in her throne,\nand spake not a long while; then she said:  Come hither, and grovel\nbefore Us, and hearken!  Even so we did; and she said again:  Our\nsister, who hath been so kind unto you, and saved you from so many\npains, here telleth Us, by the message of the two doves, that ye have\nbetrayed Us and her, and have stolen her thrall and her Sending Boat,\nand sent her an errand for Our destruction; and therewith she\ndelivereth you into Our hands, and ye are Ours henceforward; nor is\nit to be thought that ye may escape Us.  Now, for your treason, some\nwould slay you outright here and now, but We will be merciful, and\nlet you live, and do no more than chastise you sharply now; and\nthereafter shall ye be Our very thralls to do as We will with:\nthereafter, that is to say, when they whom ye have sent Our sister's\nthrall to fetch have come hither (as belike I may scarce stay them),\nand I have foiled them and used them, and sent them away empty.  Now\nI tell you, that meanwhile of their coming shall ye suffer such\nthings as We will; and when they be here We will not forbid you to be\nanigh them; but We shall see that there will be little joy to you in\nthat nighness.  Yea, ye shall know now to what market ye have brought\nyour wares, and what the price of treason is therein.\n\nVerily then we suffered at her hand what she would, whereof it would\nshame me to tell more as at this present; and thereafter did she\nchain us to those three pillars of the hall whereas ye found us\nchained; and we were fed as dogs be, and served as dogs, but we\nendured all for the sake of hope; and when we durst, and deemed the\nwitch would not hear us, we spake together and enheartened each\nother.\n\nBut on the fourth day of our torment came the witch to us, and gave\nus to drink a certain red water from out of a leaden flasket; and\nwhen I drank I deemed it was poison, and was glad, if gladness might\nbe in me at such a tide; and when I had drunk I felt an icy chill go\nthrough all my body, and all things swam before my eyes, and deadly\nsickness came over me.  But that passed away from me presently, and I\nfelt helpless and yet not feeble; all sounds heard I clearer than\never yet in my life; also I saw the hall, every arch and pillar and\nfret, and the gleam on the pavement from the bright sun that might\nnot enter; and the witch I saw walking up and down the hall by the\ndais; but my sisters I saw not when I looked across to their pillars.\nMoreover, I might not see myself when I reached out my hand or my\nfoot, though I saw the chain which made my ankle fast to the pillar;\nand withal, when I set my hand on my face, or any other part of my\nbody, or what else I might touch, I felt there what I looked to feel,\nwere it flesh or linen, or the cold iron of my fetter, or the\npolished face of the marble pillar.\n\nNow I knew scarce if I were alive or dead, or if I were but beginning\nto be dead; but there came upon me the desire of life, and I strove\nto cry out to the sisters, but though I formed the words in my mouth,\nand did with my throat as when one cries out aloud, yet no sound of a\nvoice came from me, and more helpless did I feel than erst.\n\nBut even therewith I saw the witch come toward me, and therewith all\nmy body felt such fear of her that I knew I was not dead.  Then she\ncame before me and said:  O shadow of a thrall, whom none can see but\nthem unto whom wisdom hath given eyes to see wonders withal, now have\nI tidings for thee and thy sisters, to wit, that your lovers and\nseekers are at hand; and presently I shall bring them into this hall,\nand they shall be so nigh unto you that ye might touch them if I did\nnot forbid it; but they shall not see you, but shall wonder where I\nhave hidden you, and shall go seeking you to-day and many days, and\nshall find you not at all.  So make ye the most of the sight of them,\nfor in them henceforward ye have no other part or lot.\n\nTherewith she spat out at me, and went over to my sisters, and said\nwords of like import to those which she had said unto me.  And\npresently she went out of the hall; and not long afterwards I heard\nvoices speaking on the perron, and knew one for the voice of the\nwitch, and the other for the voice of my lord Baudoin; and then again\nwore a little while, and I saw the witch come through the great door\nof the hall leading Sir Arthur by the hand, as if she were his dear\nfriend, and Baudoin and Hugh, my man, following them.  And the said\nwitch was clad full fair, and had laid by her sloth and stupid pride,\nas meseemed; and her limbs were grown rounder and sleeker, and her\nskin fairer, so that to them that knew her not she might well seem to\nbe a goodly woman.\n\nNow they sat to meat as my man hath told you, and then departed from\nthe hall, and the witch also.  But after a while she came back again\nand loosed us, and grimly bade us go with her, and needs must we,\nthough we could not so much as see our own feet upon the floor.  And\nshe set us to tasks about the house, and stood by while we toiled for\nher, and mocked us not without stripes, and in all ways was as rough\nand cruel and hard with us as she had been smooth and debonair to our\nlords; but after noon she brought us back and chained us to our\npillars again.  And when the evening came and the banquet was, it was\nwe who were the unseen players of the string-play; and we might play\nno other melody than what the witch bade us; else belike, could we\nhave held converse, we might have played such tunes as would have\nsmitten the hearts of our loves, and told them that we were anigh.\nTo make a short story of it, thus did she day by day, and no comfort\nor converse might we sisters have of each other, or of aught else\nsave the sight of our beloved ones, and a glimmer of hope therewith.\nAnd, forsooth, for as grievously as my heart was wrung by the\nyearning of me for my love, yet was it a joy unto me to think that he\nwent there desiring me, and that whom he desired was not the poor\nwretched creature chained there in her nakedness, with her body\nspoiled by torment and misery, but the glad maiden whom he had so\noften called fair and lovesome.\n\nSo passed the days, and at last hope had grown so pale and wan, that\nshe was no more to be seen by us than we were by our lords; and now\nit seemed to me that death was coming, so feeble and wretched as I\ngrew.  But the witch would not let us die, but sustained us from time\nto time with some little draughts of a witch-drink that revived us.\n\nSo wore the time till that evening, when came hope together with the\nfulfilment of hope, so that one minute we durst hope for deliverance,\nand the next we were delivered.\n\nNor is there more to tell, Birdalone, my dear, save that we came\nsafely to the Isle of the Young and the Old in the full morning-tide;\nand as our ferry drew nigh the green shore, there were the two\nyounglings whereof thou didst tell us awaiting our landing, and when\nwe stepped ashore they came to us bearing cakes and fruit in a fair\nbasket, and they made much of us and we of them.  And so we came to\nthe old man, who was exceeding fain of us, and grand and courteous,\ntill he became a little drunk, and then he was somewhat over-kind to\nus women.  Nevertheless, there in that pleasant isle we rested us for\nthree days, that we might somewhat calm and refresh our spirits with\nwhat was small and of little account.  And when we departed, the old\nman followed us down to the strand, and lamented our departure, as he\nhad done with our lords erewhile; only this time yet greater was his\nlamentation, and needs must we kiss him, each one of us, or never had\nhe been done.  So he turned up landward, bewailing the miss of us,\nbut presently, before we had seen the last of him, was cheerful again\nand singing.\n\nSo we went on our way; and we also, we maidens, in our turn, saw\nthose woeful images of the Isle of Queens and the Isle of Kings; and\nwe came to the Isle of Nothing, and abode warily by our ferry, and so\ncame away safe, and thus, as thou wottest, home to the castle to hear\nevil tidings of thee.  Now is this all my tale.\n\nBirdalone sat shyly and hushed when all was done; and then all they\ndid somewhat to comfort her, each after their own fashion; and now\nsorrow for the slain man was made softer and sweeter for them,\nwhereas they had to lose not two fellows, but one only.  Yet, despite\nof all, trouble and care was on Birdalone's soul betwixt the joy of\nloving and being beloved, and the pain and fear of robbing a friend\nof her love.  For Atra's face, which she might not hate, and scarce\nmight love, was a threat to her day by day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.  BIRDALONE AND THE BLACK SQUIRE TALK TOGETHER IN THE HALL\nOF THE CASTLE.\n\n\n\nNow within a few days was the body of Baudoin laid in earth in the\nchapel of the castle; and in the solemnest of fashions was the burial\ndone.  When it was over, the two knights and Sir Aymeris turned them\nheartily to dighting the war against the Red Hold, and less than a\nmonth thereafter was the hosting at the Castle of the Quest, and if\nthe host were not very many (for it went not above sixteen hundreds\nof men all told), yet the men were of the choicest, both of knights\nand sergeants and archers.  There then they held a mote without the\ncastle, whereas Arthur the Black Squire was chosen for captain, and\nin three days they were to depart for the Red Hold.\n\nNow this while Birdalone had seen but little of Arthur, who was ever\nbusy about many matters, and never had she had any privy talk with\nhim, though sore she longed for it; yet indeed it was more by her\nwill than his that so it was.  But when it was come to the very last\nday before the departure, she said that she must needs see him before\nhe went, and he perchance never to come back again.  So when men were\nquiet after dinner she went into the hall and found him there, pacing\nup and down the floor.  For indeed she had sent a word to him by\nLeonard the priest that he should be there.\n\nSo she went up to him, and all simply she took him by the hand and\nled him into a shot-window and set him down by her; and he, all\ntrembling for love and fear of her, might not forbear, but kissed her\nface and her mouth many times; and she grew as hot as fire, and\nsomewhat she wept.\n\nThen she spake after a while:  Dear friend, I had it in my mind to\nsay to thee many things that meseems were sage, but now neither will\nthe thought of them come into my mind, nor the words into my mouth.\nAnd this is a short hour.  And therewith she fell to kissing him,\ntill he was well-nigh beside himself betwixt desire and joy and the\ngrief of departure, and the hardness of the case.\n\nBut at last she forbore and said:  Will it not be when thou art gone\nto-morrow as it was when ye were away upon the Quest, and I knew not\nhow to bear myself, so heavy lay all the world and its doings and its\nfashion upon me?  It will be hard to me, he said; evil and grim will\nbe the days.  She said:  And yet, even now in these last days, when I\nsee thee oft, every day my soul is worn with grief, and I know not\nwhat to do with myself.  I shall come back, he said, and bear my love\nwith me, and then belike we shall seek some remedy.  She was silent a\nwhile, and then she said:  Meanwhile of thy coming, and I see thee\nnot at all for many days, how will it be with my grief then?  Quoth\nhe:  More than enough of grief no soul may bear; for either death\ncomes, or else some dullness of the pain, and then by little and\nlittle the pain weareth.  Then she said:  And how would it be if thou\ncome not back and I see thee never again, or if when thou come back\nthou find me not, for that I be either dead or gone away out of thy\nreach?  He said:  I know not how it would be.  When thou sayest thou\nshalt die, dost thou wholly believe it in thy sense or thy body\notherwise than Holy Church would?  I will tell thee, she said, that\nnow I am sitting by thee and seeing thy face and hearing thy voice,\nit is that only which I believe in; for I may think of nought else of\neither grief or joy.  Yea, when I wept e'en now, it was not for\nsorrow that I wept, but for I cannot rightly tell what.  And she took\nhis hand and looked fondly upon him.\n\nBut presently she looked on his hand, and said:  And now meseemeth\nthat we twain are grown to be such close friends that I may ask thee\nwhat I will, and thou be neither angry, nor wonder thereat.  I see on\nthy finger here the ring that I brought with me from the Isle of\nIncrease, and which thereafter thou hadst of me when I gave thee back\nalso the shoon which were lent unto me.  Tell me how thou hadst it\nback from Atra, as I suppose thou gavest it unto her.  But how now\nart thou angry? for I see the blood come up in thy face.  Nay,\nbeloved, said he, I am not angry, but whenso I hear of Atra, or think\nof her closely, shame comes on me and confusion, and maybe fear.  But\nnow will I answer thee.  For even in those hours which we wore on the\nIsle of the Young and the Old, when all we should have been so happy\ntogether, she divined somewhat of my case, or indeed, why do I not\nsay it out, all thereof.  And she spake to me such words (for she is\nboth tender and wise and strong of heart) that I cowered before her\nand her grief and pain; and she gave me back the said ring, which\nforsooth I gave to her in the Sending Boat in the first hour that the\nIsle of Increase lay astern of us.  And I wear it now as a token of\nmy grief for her grief.  See now, love, since I have answered thee\nthis question without anger or amaze, thou needest not fear to ask me\nany other; for this of all things lies closest to my heart.\n\nBirdalone drooped her head, and she spake in a low voice:  Lo now!\nthe shadow of parting and the shadow of death could not come between\nour present joy; but this shadow of the third one cometh between us\nand is present between us.  Woe's me! how little did I think of this\nwhen thou wert away and I was sick of longing for the sight of thee,\nand deemed that that would heal it all.\n\nHe spake not, but took her hand and held it; and presently she looked\nup again and said:  Thou art good, and wilt not be angry if I ask\nthee something else; this it is:  Why wert thou so grim with me that\nother day when ye found me in that evil plight in tow of the Red\nTyrant, so that I deemed that thou of all others hadst cast me off?\nThat was worse to me than the witch's stripes, and I kept thinking to\nmyself:  How simple was my trouble once, and now how tangled and\nweary!\n\nThen he might not refrain him, but threw himself upon her, and\nclipped her and kissed her all he might, and she felt all the\nsweetness of love, and lacked nought of kindness and love to him.\nAnd thereafter they sat still awhile, and he said, as if her question\nhad but that moment left her lips:  This, forsooth, was the cause\nthat I looked grim on thee:  first, that from the time I first saw\nthee and heard thy tale, and of thy deeds, I had deemed thee wise\nabove the wisdom of women.  But this going forth of thee to the Black\nValley, whereof came the slaying of Baudoin, seemed unto me a mere\nfolly, till again I had heard thy tale of that also; and then the\ntale and thy speech overcame me.  But again, though I was grieved and\ndisappointed hereat, belike that had passed from me speedily, but\nthen there was this also which would not let my soul rest, to wit,\nthat I feared concerning that slain knight whose head the Red One had\nhung about thy neck; for how else, methought, might he have been so\nwroth with him and thee; and meseemed, moreover, that thou wert kind\nin thine heart to the dead man, even when we were come to thee; and\nthen, seest thou, my desire for thee and the trouble of Baudoin's\nslaying, and the black trouble aforesaid.  Lo now, I have told thee\nthis.  When wilt thou cease to be angry with me?\n\nShe said:  I ceased to be grieved with thine anger when thine anger\ndied; yet strange, meseemeth, that thou shouldst trust me so little\nwhen thou lovest me so much!\n\nAnd she leaned against him and caressed him gently, and again was he\nat point to take her in his arms, when lo! the sound of men coming\nunto the screen of the hall; so then those two stood up and went to\nmeet them, and there was the speech of their sundering done.  Yet\nbelike for a little while both those twain were happy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.  THE KNIGHTS AND THEIR FELLOWS BETAKE THEM TO THE\nASSAULTING OF THE RED HOLD\n\n\n\nOn the morrow, when the day was yet young, the knights were ready for\ndeparture, and in the very gate they bade farewell to the ladies, who\nkissed them kindly one and all, and Viridis wept sore; and Atra\nconstrained herself to do even as the others did; but pale she was\nand quaking when she kissed Arthur and watched him get a-horseback.\n\nBut the knights bade their ladies be of good cheer, for that they\nwould send them tidings of how they sped every seven days at least,\nwhereas it was no long way thence to the Red Hold, save there were\nbattle on the road, and they deemed their host which should beset the\nHold would be enough to clear all the ways behind it.  For that same\ncause withal they had Sir Aymeris with them, nor left a many men\nbehind them, and they under the rule of three squires, whereof two\nwere but young, and the third, who was made the captain of the\ncastle, was an old and wise man of war, who had to name Geoffrey of\nLea.  There, withal, was the priest Sir Leonard, who went about now\nmuch hushed and abashed, and seemed to fear to give a word to\nBirdalone; albeit she deemed of him that his thoughts of her were the\nsame as erst they had been.\n\nSo now when the knights were departed, and all the host was gone out\nof sight, it was heavy time indeed in the Castle of the Quest till\nthey should hear tidings of them again.  Both Aurea and Atra kept\nmuch to themselves, and did I know not what to wear away the time;\nfor now it was not to be looked for that they should venture out-a-\ngates.  But as for Viridis, she waxed of better cheer after a while,\nbut whatever betid she would not sunder herself from Birdalone; nay,\nnot for an hour; and Birdalone took all her kindness kindly, though\nforsooth it was somewhat of a pain unto her; it shall be told\nwherefore ere long.\n\nWithal, as if to wear the time, Birdalone betook her diligently to\nher needlework, and fell to the cunningest of broidery; so that\nViridis and the others wondered at her, for when they were done it\nseemed indeed that the flowers and creatures and knots had grown of\nthemselves upon the cloth, such wondrous work it was.\n\nMoreover, to his great joy, the very first day of the departure of\nthe host she called Sir Leonard unto her, and prayed to go on again\nwith the learning her fair scribe-craft; and therein also was she\ndiligent hours of every day; and Viridis would sit beside her\nwondering at the deftness of her fingers, and crying out for joy as\nthe page grew fair and well-learned under them.\n\nThus wore a week, and at the end thereof came a messenger from the\nhost and told how they had come before the Red Hold and had summoned\nthem thereof to yield, which they had utterly denied to do, but\ndefied the host; wherefore the host had now beset the Hold, and more\nfolk were daily flocking unto them; but that the said Hold would be\nhard to win by plain assault, whereas it was both strong and well-\nmanned; but few of the host had been slain or hurt as yet, and of the\nchieftains not one.\n\nRight glad were they of the castle because of these tidings; though,\nforsooth, the men-at-arms knew well enough that the time would soon\ncome when some fierce assault would be made, and then, forsooth,\nwould be sore peril of life and limb unto the chieftains.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.  BIRDALONE BETHINKS HER TO FULFIL THE PROMISE MADE UNTO\nATRA\n\n\n\nAgain wore a week, and once more came the messenger, and did them of\nthe castle to wit that there had been nought more done at the Red\nHold, save skirmishing at the barriers, wherein few were hurt on\neither side; and also that the engines for battering the walls were\nnow well-nigh all dight, and they would begin to play upon the Hold,\nand in especial one which hight Wall-wolf, which had been set up by\nthe crafts of Greenford.\n\nThis tidings also was deemed good by all, save it might be by Atra,\nwho, as Birdalone deemed, pined and fretted herself at the delay, and\nwould fain that, one way or other, all were over.  Atra spake but\nlittle to Birdalone, but watched her closely now; oft would she gaze\non her wistfully, as if she would that Birdalone would speak unto\nher; and Birdalone noted that, but she might not pluck up heart\nthereto.\n\nWore a third week, and again came the messenger, and told how three\ndays ago, whenas Wall-wolf had sorely battered one of the great\ntowers which hight the Poison-jar, and overthrown a pan of the wall\nthere beside, they had tried an assault on the breach, and hard had\nbeen the battle there, and in the end, after fierce give and take,\nthey of the Hold had done so valiantly that they had thrust back the\nassailants, and that in the hottest brunt the Black Squire had been\nhurt in the shoulder by a spear-thrust, but not very grievously; but\nwithal that he sent, in so many words, forbidding the ladies to make\nany account of so small a matter.  And, quoth the sergeant, most like\nmy lord will wear his armour in four days' time; also now we have\nreared another great slinger, which we call Stone-fretter, and soon,\nwithout doubt, we shall be standing victorious within that den of\nthieves.\n\nNow though these tidings were not so altogether ill, yet were those\nladies sore troubled thereby, and especially Atra, who swooned\noutright when she had heard the last word thereof.\n\nAs for Birdalone, she made as little semblance of her trouble as she\nmight, but when all was quiet again she went to find Viridis, and\nbrought her to her chamber and spake to her, saying:  Viridis, my\nsister, thou hast been piteous kind unto me from the first minute\nthat thou sawest me naked and helpless, and fleeing from evil unto\nworse evil; nowise mightest thou have done better by me hadst thou\nbeen verily my sister of blood; and I know it that thou wouldst be\nloth to part from me.\n\nViridis wept and said:  Why dost thou speak of parting from me, when\nthou knowest it would break my heart?\n\nSaid Birdalone:  To say it as short as may be, because the parting\nmust now come to pass.  Viridis waxed pale and then red, and she\nstamped her foot and said:  It is unkind of thee to grieve me thus,\nand thou doest wrong herein.\n\nHearken, dear sister, said Birdalone:  thou knowest, for thou thyself\nwast the first to tell me thereof, that I am the supplanter in our\nfellowship, and that I have undone Atra's hope.  This I did not of\nmine own will, but it came unto me; yet of mine own will I can do the\nbest I may to amend it; and this is the best, that I depart hence\nbefore the Red Hold is taken and my lords come back; for if they come\nback and I see my lord Arthur, so fair and beauteous as he is, before\nme, never shall I be able to go away from him.  And lo thou, I have\npromised Atra by all the kindness she did me when we were come to the\nWailing Tower, and I naked and quaking and half-dead with terror,\nthat if occasion served I would do my utmost to help her, even if it\nwere to my own grief.  Now behold this that now is, is the occasion,\nand there will not be another; for when my love comes home hither and\nbeholdeth me, think thou how all the desire which has been gathering\nin his heart this while will blossom and break forth toward me; and\nmayhappen he will make but little semblance of it before other folk,\nfor proud and high of heart is he; but he will seek occasion to find\nme alone, and then shall I be with him as the lark in the talons of\nthe sparrow-hawk, and he will do his pleasure of me, and that with\nall the good-will of my heart.  And then shall I be forsworn to Atra,\nand she will hate me, as now she doth not, and then is all the\nfellowship riven, and that by my deed.\n\nYet was Viridis wrath, and she said:  Meseemeth this is fool's talk.\nWill not the fellowship be all the more riven if thou depart and we\nsee thee no more?\n\nO nay, said Birdalone; for when I am gone thy love shall be no less\nfor me, though as now thou art angry; and Atra will love me for that\nI shall have held to my promise to mine own scathe; and thy man and\nAurea will lay it to me that I have done valiantly and knightly.  And\nArthur, how can he choose but love me; and maybe we shall yet meet\nagain.\n\nAnd therewithal she did at last bow down her head and fall to\nweeping, and Viridis was moved by her tears and fell to kissing and\ncaressing her.\n\nAfter a little Birdalone lifted up her head and spake again:\nMoreover, how can I dare to abide him? didst thou not see how grim he\nwas to me when they delivered me and brought me back? and he with his\nown lips told me so much, that it was because he doubted that I had\ndone amiss; and now if I do amiss again, even if it be at his\nbidding, will it not be so that he will speedily weary of me, and\ncurse me and cast me off?  What sayest thou, Viridis mine?\n\nWhat is to say, said Viridis, save that thou hast broken my heart?\nBut thou mayst heal it if thou wilt take thy words back, and tell me\nthat thou wilt not sunder thee from us.\n\nBut Birdalone brake out weeping and lamenting aloud, and she cried\nout:  Nay, nay, it may not be; I must depart, and Atra hath smitten\nme amidst of my friends.  And Viridis knew not what to say or to do.\n\nAt last came Birdalone to herself again, and she looked sweetly on\nViridis and smiled on her from out her tears, and said:  Thou seest,\nsister, how little a loss thou wilt have of me, a mere wild woman.\nAnd now nought availeth either me or thee but I must begone, and that\nspeedily.  Let it be to-morrow then.  And when the messenger comes at\nthe end of this week, send word by him of what I have done; and look\nthou to it but both our lords will praise me for the deed.\n\nSaid Viridis:  But whither wilt thou, or what wilt thou do?  To\nGreenford first, said Birdalone, and after whither the Good Lord\nshall lead me; and as for what I will do, I am now deft in two\ncrafts, script and broidery to wit; and, wheresoever I be, folk shall\npay me to work herein for them, whereby I shall earn my bread.\nHearken also, my sister, canst thou give me any deal of money? for\nthough I wot little of such matters, yet I wot that I shall need the\nsame.  And I ask this whereas, as e'en now I said, I deem our lords\nshall praise my deed, and that, therefore, they would not that I\nshould depart hence as an outcast, wherefore they shall not begrudge\nit to me.  Moreover, for the same cause I would thee speak to the old\nsquire Geoffrey of Lea, and tell him that I have an errand to\nGreenford, and crave of him that he lend me one of the two\nyounglings, Arnold or Anselm, and two or three men-at-arms to bring\nme safely thither; since now, forsooth, I need no more adventures on\nthe road.\n\nShe smiled as she spake; and now all the passion of anguish seemed to\nhave left her for that while; but Viridis cast her arms about her\nneck and wept upon her bosom, and said:  Woe's me! for I see that\nthou wilt go whatsoever I may say or do; I strove to be angry with\nthee, but I might not, and now I see that thou constrainest me as\nthou dost all else.  I will go now straightway and do thine errand.\n\nThus then they parted for that time; but it was not till the day\nafter the morrow that Birdalone was alboun.  Viridis told of her\ndeparture both to Aurea and Atra; and Aurea lamented it, but would\nnot do aught to stay her; for she was waxen weary and listless since\nthe death of her man.  As for Atra, she spake but little concerning\nit, but to Viridis praised Birdalone's valiance and kindness.  Yet\nunto herself she said:  Verily she understood my word that I spake to\nher about the occasion of her helping.  Yet woe's me! for she shall\ncarry his love with her whithersoever she wendeth; and a happy woman\nis she.\n\nBut when Geoffrey the squire knew that the ladies, all three, were at\none with Birdalone as to her departure, he doubted nothing, but bade\nArnold, his mate, take four good men with him, and bring the Lady\nBirdalone unto Greenford and do her bidding there.  Albeit, he deemed\nno less but they would bring her back again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.  BIRDALONE LEAVES THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nOn the morrow morn, then, Birdalone spake farewell both to Aurea and\nAtra; but as for Viridis, she sent her word that she had no heart\nthereto, and yet she sent her a word of comfort, to wit, that she\ndeemed that they would one day meet again.  Aurea, in her parting\nwords, part praised her, part chid her; saying that she did well and\nkindly and valiantly, as her wont was.  Yet, said she, when all is\nsaid, thou mightest have abided this tangle and trouble, which at the\nworst had not been so evil as death between us.  Yea, sister, said\nBirdalone, but might not death have come of my abiding?\n\nAs she spake, in came Atra, with her head somewhat drooped, meek and\nhumble, her cheeks red, her hands trembling; and she said:  Wilt thou\ntake now my word of farewell and blessing, and the kiss of peace\nbetwixt us, and bear away the memory of our kindness together?\n\nBirdalone stood up proud and straight, and was somewhat pale as she\nsuffered Atra to kiss her cheeks and mouth, and said:  Now hast thou\nforgiven me that weird dragged me in betwixt thy love and thy\ngoodhap; and I have forgiven thee that I am led away by weird into\nthe waste and the wilderness of love.  Farewell.  Therewith she went\nher way to the gate, and the others followed her not.\n\nWithout abode her Arnold and the four men-at-arms, and her palfrey\nand a sumpter-horse bearing two goodly coffers, wherein Viridis had\nlet load raiment and other havings for her; and Arnold came up to her\nsmiling, and said:  My lady Viridis hath given me a pouch wherein is\nmoney to bear for thee to Greenford and hand over to thee there when\nwe be safe; and she hath bidden me to be in all wise obedient unto\nthee, lady, which needed not, whereas now and from hence forth am I\nby mine own will thy very servant to do thy pleasure always and\neverywhere.\n\nShe thanked him and smiled on him kindly, so that his heart beat fast\nfor joy and love of her; and therewith she gat into the saddle and\nthey rode their ways together, and Birdalone looked back never till\nthe Castle of the Quest was shut from their eyes by the nesses of the\nlittle hills.\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Part of the Water of the Wondrous Isles, which is\ncalled The Tale of the Quest's Ending, and begins the Sixth Part of\nthe said tale, which is called The Days of Absence.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIXTH PART:  THE DAYS OF ABSENCE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.  BIRDALONE RIDES TO GREENFORD AND THERE TAKES LEAVE OF\nARNOLD AND HIS MEN\n\n\n\nOn the road to Greenford nought befell to tell of; they came thither\nwhen the sun was at point to set, for they had ridden diligently all\nday.\n\nAs they rode the streets of the good town, they noted of them, that\nthough it was evening wherein folk do much disport them abroad, there\nwere women and children enough in the streets or standing at their\ndoors, but of carles very few, and they for the more part grey-heads.\n\nNow did Arnold bring Birdalone to the town hall, wherein yet sat the\ndeputy of the burgrave, who himself was in the leaguer at the Red\nHold; this man, who was old and wise and nothing feeble of body, made\nmuch of Birdalone and her folk, and was glad of them when he knew\nthat they had the seal and let-pass of Geoffrey of Lea; wherefore he\ngave them to eat and drink, and lodged them in his own house, and\nmade them the best of cheer.\n\nBut betimes on the morrow did Birdalone send back Arnold and the four\nmen-at-arms, with no tale but that such was her will; and bidding\nfarewell to the said Arnold, she suffered him to kiss her hands, and\ngave him a ring from off her finger, so that he went on his way\nrejoicing.\n\nSo soon as she saw him and his men well on the road, she went to the\nold man, the vice-ruler of the town, who was of the aldermen thereof,\nand did him to wit that she would wage two or three carles who could\ndeal with horses and beasts, and withal handle weapons if need were,\nto be both as servants and guards for her, as she had errands in that\ncountry-side, and belike might well have to go from town to town\nthereabout.  He took her asking kindly, but said it was none so easy\nto find men who for any wage would fare forth of Greenford at that\nstour, whereas well-nigh all their fighting-men were lying before the\nRed Hold as now.  Howsoever, ere noontide he brought before her a man\nof over three score, but yet wayworthy, and two stout young men, his\nsons, and told her that these men were trusty and would go with her\nto the world's end if need were.\n\nShe took these men readily, and agreed with them for a good wage; and\nwhereas each one had bow and arrows and short sword, she had but to\nbuy for them jacks, sallets, and bucklers, and they were well armed\nas for their condition.  Withal she bought them three good horses and\nanother sumpter-horse; which last was loaded with sundry wares that\nshe deemed that she needed, and with victual.  Then she took leave of\nthe alderman, thanking him much for his good-will, and so departed\nfrom Greenford at all adventure, when the day was yet young.\n\nThe alderman had asked her whither away, and she had told him that\nshe was boun for Mostwyke first, and thereafter for Shifford-on-the-\nStrand; whereas she had heard talk of these two towns as being on one\nand the same highway, and Mostwyke about a score of miles from\nGreenford; but when she was well out-a-gates she came to a little\nroad on the right hand which turned clean away from Mostwyke, and she\ntook the said road; and when she had followed it some three miles,\nshe asked the old carle whither it led.  He looked on her and smiled\nsomewhat, and she on him in turn; and she said:  Wonder not, my\nfriend, that I am not clear about my ways, for I shall tell the sooth\nthat I am a damsel adventurous, and am but seeking some place where I\nmay dwell and earn my livelihood till better days come; and this is\nthe whole truth, and thou shalt know it at once, to wit, that I am\nindeed fleeing, and were fain to hide the footsteps of me, and I bid\nyou three to help me therein.  But ye must know that I am fleeing,\nnot from my foes, but from my friends; and, if ye will, as we go by\nthe way, I will tell you all the story of me, and we will be friends\nwhile we are together, yea, and thereafter if it may be.\n\nNow she said this because she had looked carefully on these men, and\nherseemed that they were good men and true, and not dull of wit.\nForsooth the old man, who hight Gerard of the Clee, was no weakling,\nand was nought loathly to look on, and his two sons were goodly and\ngreat of fashion, clear-eyed, and well-carven of visage; they hight\nRobert and Giles.\n\nNow spake old Gerard:  Lady, I thank thee heartily of thy much grace\nunto me; now would I get off my nag and kneel to thee in the highway\ntherefor, but that I see that thou wert fain to make as much way as\nmay be to-day; wherefore, by thy leave, I will tarry my homaging till\nwe rest our horses by the wayside.  She laughed, and praised his\nwisdom; and the young men looked on her and worshipped her in their\nhearts.  Forsooth, the fellowship of these good and true folk was\nsoft and sweet to her, and soothed the trouble of her spirit.  And\nshe enforced herself to talk cheerfully with them, and asked them\nmany things, and learned much of them.\n\nBut now went on Gerard to say:  Lady, if thou wilt hide thy ways from\nwhomsoever it may be, thou hast happened on no ill way; for though\nthis road be good to ride, it is but a byway through the sheep-walks\nthat folk may drive their wains hereby in the wet season of winter\nand spring; and for a great way we shall come to but little save the\ncots of the sheep-carles; scarce a hamlet or two for the space of two\ndays' riding; and on the third day a little town, hight Upham, where\nare but few folk save at the midsummer wool-fair, which is now gone\nby.\n\nNow there is a highway cometh into this road from out of the tilled\ncountry and Appleham, a good town, and goeth through it toward the\ntillage, and the City of the Bridges and the liberties thereof; and\nall the land is much builded and plentiful; but, if thou wilt, we\nwill not take either highway, but wend over the downland which lieth\nnorth-east of Upham, and though it be roadless, yet is it not ill-\ngoing, and I know it well and its watering-places, little dales and\nwaters therein all running north-east, wherein be certain little\nthorps here and there, which shall refresh us mightily.  Over that\ndownland we may wend a four days, and then the land will swell up\nhigh, and from the end of that high land we shall behold below us a\nfair land of tillage, well watered and wooded, and much builded; and\nin the midst thereof a great city with walls and towers, and a great\nwhite castle and a minster, and lovely houses a many.  In that city\nmayst thou dwell and earn thy livelihood if thou canst do aught of\ncrafts.  And if thou mayst not, then may we find somewhat to swink at\nfor a wage, and so maintain thee and us.  But the said city is called\nthe City of the Five Crafts, and the land round about it is the frank\nthereof; and oftenest, frank and city and all, it is called the Five\nCrafts all simply.  Now what sayest thou hereof, my lady?\n\nShe said:  I say that we will go thither, and that I thank thee and\nthy sons of thy good-will, and so may God do to me as I reward you\nwell therefor.  But tell me, good Gerard, how it is that thou art so\nwilling to leave kith and kin to follow a gangrel wife along the\nways?  Said Gerard:  Dame, I think that the face and body of thee\nmight lead any man that yet had manhood in him to follow thee, even\nif he left house and all to go with thee.  But as for us, we have no\nlonger a house or gear, whereas they of the Red Hold lifted all my\nbestial, and burned my house and all that was therein a month ago.\nYea, said Birdalone, and how befalleth it, then, that ye are not\nbefore the Red Hold to avenge thee?  Dame, said he, when the muster\nwas I was deemed somewhat over old, wherefore the sheriff took me\nnot, but suffered my sons also to abide behind to earn a living for\nme; may God be good to him therefor, and St. Leonard!  But as to my\nkindred, I must tell thee that I am not kinned hereabout, but in a\ngood town hight Utterhay, and that when our alderman sent for me to\nbring me to thee, I was more than half-minded to get me back thither.\nNow sooth it is that the best way thither, though it may be indeed\nthe safest rather than the shortest, lies through the Five Crafts;\nfor the road goes thence to Utterhay a three score miles or so,\nmaking the longer of it, as it skirteth ever some way off a perilous\nforest, a place of sore dread and devilish, which hight Evilshaw, on\nthe edge whereof lieth Utterhay, a merry cheaping-stead and a\nplenteous, and the home of my kindred.  Wherefore now is the City of\nthe Five Crafts handy to us; because when thou hast done with us, as\nI hope it may be long first, then are we others nigh home, and may\nall simply wend our way thither.\n\nBirdalone thanked him again full heartily; but therewithal as they\nrode along there seemed to stir in her some memory of the earliest of\nher days in the witch's house, and she began to have a longing to\nbetake her to Utterhay and the skirts of Evilshaw.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  OF BIRDALONE AND HER FELLOWSHIP, THEIR FARING OVER THE\nDOWNLAND\n\n\n\nThus rode they along and loitered not, though they talked blithely\ntogether; and Birdalone wondered to herself that she might so much as\nhold up her head for bitter thoughts of the days and the longings but\nlate passed away, but so it was, that it was only now and again that\nthey stung her into despair and silence, and for the most part she\nhearkened to the talk of the old man and the lads about the days of\nGreenford and the alarms of lifting and unpeace, and the ways of the\nchapmen and the craftsmen.\n\nAn hour after noon they rested in a little dale of the downland where\nwas a pool and three thorn-bushes thereby; and when they had lighted\ndown, the old man knelt before Birdalone and took her hand, and swore\nhimself her man to do her will, whatso it were; and then he stood up\nand bade his sons do likewise; so they two knelt before her in turn,\nsomewhat shy and abashed, for all that they were such stout, bold\nfellows, and found it hard to take her hand, and then when they had\nit in theirs, hard to let it go again.\n\nA score of miles and five they rode that day, and had no roof over\nthem at night save the naked heaven, but to Birdalone that was but\nlittle scathe:  they made a shift to have some fire by them, and the\nthree men sat long about it that even while Birdalone told them\nsomewhat of her life; and as she told of the House under the Wood and\nthe Great Water, Gerard had some inkling of whereabouts it was; but\nwas nought so sure, because, as abovesaid in this tale, seldom did\nany from the world of men venture in Evilshaw, or know of the Great\nWater from its banks that gave unto the forest.\n\nIn like wise they rode the next day, and came at eventide to a thorp\nin a fair little dale of the downland, and there they guested with\nthe shepherd-folk, who wondered much at the beauty of Birdalone, so\nthat at first they scarce durst venture to draw nigh unto her until\nGerard and his sons had had some familiar converse with them; then\nindeed they exceeded in kindness toward them, in their rough upland\nfashion, but ever found it hard to keep their eyes off Birdalone, and\nthat the more after they had heard the full sweetness of her voice;\nwhereas she sang to them certain songs which she had learned in the\nCastle of the Quest, though it made her heart sore; but she deemed\nshe must needs pay that kindly folk for their guestful and blithe\nways.  And thereafter they sang to the pipe and the harp their own\ndownland songs; and this she found strange, that whereas her eyes\nwere dry when she was singing the songs of love of the knighthood,\nthe wildness of the shepherd-music drew the tears from her, would\nshe, would she not.  Homelike and dear seemed the green willowy dale\nto her, and in the night ere she slept, and she lay quiet amidst of\nthe peaceful people, she could not choose but weep again, for pity of\nthe bitter-sweet of her own love, and for pity of the wide world\nwithal, and all the ways of its many folk that lay so new before her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  THEY COME TO THE CITY OF THE FIVE CRAFTS, AND BIRDALONE\nMEETS WITH THE POOR-WIFE\n\n\n\nThey made not so much way that they came to the Five Crafts on the\nfourth day, but lay under the bare heavens in a dale below the big\nswell of the downland, whereof Gerard spake.  But betimes in the\nmorning Birdalone arose and stirred up her men, and they gat to\nhorse, and rode the hill before them till they came on to the crest\nthereof.  Then Birdalone cried aloud with joy to see the lovely land\nbefore her, and the white walls and the towers of the great city,\nwhereas Greenford was but small beside it.\n\nSo they rode down into the frank, and entered the gates of the city a\nlittle after noon, and again was Birdalone in all amaze at the going\nto and fro in the streets and the thronging of the markets, and the\ndivers folk, as chapmen and men-at-arms, and craftsmen and lords, who\nused the said city; and to say sooth, somewhat her heart sank within\nher, and it seemed to her that it would be hard and troublous to have\nto deal with so much folk, and that they must needs go past her on\nthe right hand and the left without heeding her life.\n\nHowsoever, Gerard, who knew the city, brought her to a fair hostel,\nwhere she was well lodged, she and her men.  Straightway, then,\nbefore she went out into the streets again, she fell to getting\ntogether what she had of fine broidered work and of fair script, and\nto finishing what she had unfinished.  And she sent forth Gerard and\nhis sons to find out where was the market for such goods, and if she\nwould have leave to sell the same therein, or anywhere in the town;\nand Gerard found the hall of the embroiderers, and therein the master\nof the craft, and he received the carle courteously when he heard\nthat there was fine work come to town, and did him to wit that none\nin any such craft might have freedom of the market save by leave of\nthe guild of the craft; but, said he, the guilds were open-handed and\ncourteous, and were nowise wont to refuse the said leave, were the\nwork good and true; and he bade Gerard withal tell his mistress that\nshe were best to bring samplings of her work to the Guildhall so soon\nas she might.  So the very next day went Birdalone thither, and found\nthe master a well-looked tall man of some five-and-forty winters, who\nlooked on her from the first as if he deemed it were no ill way of\nwearing the time.  To this man she showed her work, and though he\nfound it not easy to take his eyes off Birdalone herself, yet when he\nlooked at her handiwork, he found it better than very good, and he\nsaid to her:  Damsel, here is what will be sought for at a great\nprice by the great lords and ladies of the land, and the rich\nburgesses, and especially by the high prelates; and so much of it as\nthou hast a mind to do is so much coined gold unto thee; and now I\nsee thee what thou art, I were fain that thou gathered good to thee.\nBut as diligent as thou mayst be, thou hast but one pair of hands,\nwonderful soothly, and yet but one pair.  He broke off at that word,\nfor he was verily staring at her hands, and longing to see more of\nher arms than the wrists only, so that he scarce knew what he was\nsaying.  Then he turned red and said:  Soothly I wot that no other\nhands save thine may do such needlework, or make the draughts for\nthem.  But thou wilt need women-servants to help thee, both in\ndighting the house for thee (for this big old carle here will be\nscarce meet thereto) and as apprentices to help thee about the work\nitself; and if thou wilt, I shall seek the best ones out for thee.\nMoreover I must tell thee, that though I know for sure how that no\nwoman in the world may work such needlework as thine, yet whiles\nthere cometh hither a woman of middle age, a woman worn by troubles,\npious, meek, and kind; and by St. Lucia! now I look on thee again,\nshe might be somewhat like unto thee, were she young and fresh-\nlooking and strong as thou art.  Now this woman I say, and thereat I\nmarvel, doeth needlework that is somewhat after the manner of thine,\nand which seemed to us excellent till I had seen thine.  Good\nlivelihood she earneth thereby, and is diligent therein; but she hath\nno heart to get apprentices, or be made one of our guild, both of\nwhich were lawful to her as to thee, lovely damsel.  But now I shall\ncounsel her to be made of our guild along with thee, if thou wilt\nhave it so, and then may ye both have three apprentices each, and may\nmake in our city a goodly school, so that our guild shall be\nglorified thereby, for there will be none such work in the world.\nHow sayest thou?\n\nShe thanked him much, and yeasaid him, and thought in her heart that\nsuch work which would keep her hands and her head both busy, would\nsolace the grief of her heart, and wear away the time, that she might\nlive till hope might peradventure arise in her.\n\nThen said the master:  There is one thing else, that is, thy\ndwelling-place; and if thou wilt I shall hire thee a house in the\nstreet of the Broiderers, a goodly one:  sooth to say, that same is\nmine own, so thou mayst deem that I tell thee hereof to mine own\ngain; and that may be (and he reddened therewith); but there is this\nin it, that if thou lackest money I shall let thee live therein\nwithout price till thou shalt have earned more than enough to pay me.\n\nBirdalone thanked him well, but she did him to wit that she was\nnowise penniless; and presently she departed well pleased, though she\ndeemed that the said master was well-nigh more friendly than might be\nlooked for.  And the next day he came to her in the hostelry, and\nwithout more ado brought her to the house in the street of the\nBroiderers, and she found it fair and well plenished, and so she fell\nto work to get all things ready.\n\nNow the next week was the day appointed when she should be received\ninto the broiderers' guild, and the day before came the master\naforesaid to see Birdalone.  Sooth to say, he had not failed to come\nto see her every day, on one pretence or another, since the first day\nthey had met, but ever he did to her with all honour and simply.  But\non this day he brought with him the woman skilful of her hands, to\nshow her unto Birdalone, who received her gladly, and thereafter\nMaster Jacobus left them alone together.\n\nThe said woman looked worn and aged indeed, but was not of more than\nfive-and-forty winters even by seeming, after the first look at her;\nshe was somewhat tall and well-knit, her face well shapen, and her\nhair yet goodly.  There was a kind look in the eyes of her, as if she\nmight love anyone with whom she lived that would be kind to her.\nMeek, or rather over-meek, of mien she was, and it seemed of her that\nshe had been sore scared and oppressed one while or another.\n\nSo when Master Jacobus was gone, Birdalone set her down on the settle\nbeside her, and spake to her full sweetly and kindly, and the woman\nspake little in turn save answering simply to her questions.\nBirdalone asked where she was kinned, and she answered:  In Utterhay.\nThen said Birdalone:  Within these last few days I have heard that\ntown named twice or thrice, and never before, as meseemeth; and yet,\nhearing the name from thy mouth, it seemeth to stir something in me,\nas if I had been there one time and longed to be there again.  Is\nthere aught in the place whereof folk tell wide about, so that I\nmight have heard it told of and not noted it at the time?  Nay, lady,\nsaid the dame, save perchance that it is on the verge of a very great\nand very evil wood, otherwise it was once a merry town and of much\nresort from the country-side.\n\nBirdalone looked on her, and saw that the tears were coming from her\neyes and running down her cheeks as she spake; so she said to her:\nWhy dost thou weep, mother?  Is there aught I may do to assuage thy\ngrief?  Said the dame:  Thou art so kind to me, and thy voice is so\ndear and sweet, that I cannot choose but weep.  Meseems it is because\nlove of thee hath taken mine heart, and therewith is blended memory\nof past sorrow of mine.  Thou askest me if thou mayest do aught to\nassuage my grief; dear lady, I am not grieved now, that has gone by;\nnay, now I am more than not grieved, I am made happy, because I am\nwith thee.  But since thou art so debonair with me, I will ask thee\nto do somewhat for me; and that is, to tell me of thy life gone by; I\nmean, sweet young damsel, of thy life when thou wert a little child.\n\nThen Birdalone kissed her and said:  It goes to my heart that thou\nlovest me; for soon as I set eyes on thee my heart went out to thee;\nand now belike we shall be dear friends; and that is a thing that\nshall avail me much, to have a friend who is so much older than I, so\nthat nought can come between us, of the love of men and other griefs.\nYea, now, said the dame, smiling somewhat sadly; now do I see the\nwater standing in thine eyes, and thy voice quavers.  Is it so, thou\nlovely kind damsel, that thou hast been grieved by love of a man?\nWho then may prevail in love if thou prevail not?  And she fell to\nfondling Birdalone's hand; but Birdalone said:  It is over-long to\ntell of all my life, mother, though I be so young; but now I will do\nas thou badest me, and tell thee somewhat of my days when I was\nlittle.\n\nAnd therewith she fell to telling her of her days in the House under\nthe Wood, and the witch and her surliness and grimness, and of her\nlove of the wild things, and how she waxed there.  And she spake a\nlong while, for the memory of those days seemed to lead her along, as\nthough she verily were alive now in them; and the woman sat before\nher, gazing on her lovingly, till Birdalone stayed her tale at last\nand said:  Now have I told thee more than enough of a simple matter,\nand a life that was as that of a wild creature of the woods.  Now\nshalt thou, mother, tell me somewhat of thee, and what was thy grief\nof Utterhay:  for thou shalt find that the telling thereof shall\nsolace thee.  Ah! so think young folk, said the woman sadly, because\nthere are many days left for them to hope in.  But though the telling\nof my sorrow be a fresh sorrow to me, yet shalt thou hear it.  It is\nbut of the loss of my babe; but she was of all babes the fairest and\nthe sweetest.\n\nThen she fell to telling Birdalone all that concerning the witch at\nUtterhay and the poor-wife that ye have heard in the beginning of\nthis book, until the time when she left the house to buy meat for the\nwitch; for she herself was the said poor-wife.  And then she told how\nshe came back again and found her guest gone and the child withal;\nand though she had wept for love of Birdalone, she wept not at\ntelling of this grief, but told it as a tale which had befallen some\nother one.  And she said:  And so when I had done running up and down\nlike a wild thing, and asking of the neighbours with lack of breath\nand fierceness of speech who had taken my child away from me; and\nwhen I had gone up to the wood and even some way into it, and when I\nhad wandered up and down again, and night was falling, I came back at\nlast again to my poor house so weary with my woe, that I scarce knew\nwhat had befallen me.  And there upon the board lay the victual and\ndrink which I had brought, and the money which the witch had given\nunto me; and despite of grief, hunger flamed up in me at the sight,\nand I threw myself on to it and ate and drank, and so came to myself,\nthat is, to my grief.  But the next day I ran about hither and\nthither, and wearied folk with my asking and my woe; but it was all\nof none avail.  The child was gone away from me.  There is little\nmore to tell of me, sweet lady.  If I were to live, needs must I take\nthe poor price of my little one, to wit, the witch's money, and deal\nwith folk for my livelihood; wherefore I bought me cloth and silks,\nhaving now the wherewithal, and set to work on broidery, for even\nthen was I a cunning needle-woman.  So were God and the saints good\nto me, and inclined the folk to me, that they were good and piteous,\nand I lacked not work nor due livelihood; but after a while I wearied\nof Utterhay, where my dear child should have been running about\nbefore my feet; and having by this time gotten a little money\ntogether, and being exceeding deft in my craft, I came on hither to\nlive, and, praise be to St. Ursula! I have found it easy to live:\nand praise be to All-hallows withal that I have found thee, who art\nso kind and lovely; and thou by seeming of the very age my child\nshould be if she be living:  or how old art thou, dear lady?\n\nBirdalone laid her hand on her breast, and she was turned pale, but\nshe said in a low voice:  I deem that I am of twenty summers.\n\nThen they both sat silent, till Birdalone might master the fluttering\nof her heart, and she said:  Now meseems I have a memory even earlier\nthan those I told thee erst.  A woman took me out of a basket and set\nme on the back of an ass, and I looked about, and I was in a grassy\nlawn of the woods; and I saw a squirrel run up a tree-trunk before\nme, and wind round the tree and hide him; and then I stretched out my\nhands and cried out to him; and then came the woman unto me, and gave\nme wood-strawberries to eat out of her hand.\n\nBrake out the poor-wife thereat, pale and trembling:  Tell me now, my\nchild, hast thou any memory of what the woman was who set thee on the\nass and gave thee the strawberries?  Birdalone looked on her, and\nscanned her face closely, and then shook her head, and said:  Nay, it\nwas not thou, mother.  Nay, surely; nay, surely, said the woman; but\nthink again.  Said Birdalone, speaking slowly:  Was it my mistress\nthen?  She was a tall woman, somewhat thin and bony, with goodly red\nhair and white-skinned, but thin-lipped.  Quoth the poor-wife:  No,\nno; it is of no use; nought such was she.  Then Birdalone looked up\nand said eagerly:  Yea, but it was her other shape belike:  therein\nwas she a tall woman, dark-haired, hook-nosed, and hawk-eyed, as if\nof thirty summers; a stark woman.  Hast thou seen such? dost thou\nremember her?\n\nThe woman sprang up and cried out, and was like to have fallen, but\nBirdalone arose and held her in her arms and comforted her, and set\nher in her seat again and knelt before her; and presently the poor-\nwife came to herself and said:  My child, thou sayest do I remember\nher; how shall I ever forget her? she was the thief who stole my\nchild.\n\nTherewith she slid from off her seat, and knelt by Birdalone, and\nstooped low down on the floor as if the tall maiden were but a little\none, and she fell to kissing her and patting her, her face and her\nhands, and all about; and said, sobbing and yet smiling:  Suffer me a\nlittle, my child, mine own lovely child!  For in good sooth I am thy\nmother, and it is long since I have seen thee:  but hearken, when I\ncome quite to myself I shall pray thee not to leave me yet awhile,\nand I shall pray thee to love me.\n\nBirdalone clipped and kissed her, and said:  I love thee dearly, and\nnever, never shall I leave thee.\n\nThen they stood up, and the mother took Birdalone by the shoulders,\nand held her a little aloof, and devoured her with her eyes; and she\nsaid:  Yea, thou hast grown tall, and belike wilt grow no taller:\nand how fair and lovely thou hast grown; and thou that wert born in a\npoor man's house! no wonder that any should covet thee.  And I, I\nwonder if ever I was as fair as thou art; forsooth many called me\nfair for a little while; and now behold me!  Nay, child and darling,\nlet not thy face grow downcast, for now shall I know nought more of\nfear and grief; and is it not like that I shall grow fairer of flesh,\nand shapelier, in the happy days we shall dwell together?  And\ntherewith she took her to her arms, and it seemed as if she might\nnever have enough of clipping and embracing her; and she would look\nat Birdalone's hands and her feet and her arms, and stroke them and\ncaress them; and she wondered at her body, as if she had been a young\nmother eaten up with the love of her firstborn.  And as for\nBirdalone, she was as glad of her mother as might be; and yet in her\nheart she wondered if perchance one of the fellowship might stray\nthat way, and be partaker in her joy of this newfound dear friend;\nand she said, might it be Viridis; but in her inmost heart, though\nshe told it not to herself, she longed that the Black Squire might\nfind her out at last.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  OF THE LOVE OF GERARD'S SONS AND OF JACOBUS FOR\nBIRDALONE\n\n\n\nNow dwelt Birdalone in rest and peace when she had been taken into\nthe guild along with her mother, and they had taken the due\napprentices to them; and they began to gather much of goods to them,\nfor of fine broidery there was little done in the Five Crafts, and\nnone at all that could be put beside their work, either for beauty of\nthe draught of it, or for skill of handiwork.  She declared unto all\nfolk how that the poor-wife (who had to name Audrey) was her very\nmother, from whom she had been stolen in her youngest days; but she\ntold none any tale of how she was stolen.  And the twain dwelt\ntogether in the greatest loving-kindness; and it was with Audrey as\nshe had forecast, that now her days were happy, and she living in all\nease and content, that the goodliness of her youth came back to her,\nand she became a fair woman as for her years; and therewith it grew\nto be clear that the two were so much alike one to the other, that\nall might see that they were mother and daughter.\n\nGerard and his two sons she maintained yet as her men; and not only\nwere they of much use to her in fetching and carrying, but also true\nit is that her beauty was so manifest, that she whiles needed a stout\nlad weaponed at her back when she was in the streets or amidst the\nthrong of the market; and many were they, and whiles of the highest,\nwho craved love of her, some with honour, and some with lack of it.\n\nOf these, forsooth, were but two that anywise troubled her; and the\nmost trouble was this, that she might not fail to see that the love\nof her had entered into the hearts of the two Gerardsons, Robert and\nGiles; so that times were when she deemed she must even send them\naway, but when it came to the point she had not the heart thereto;\nthough none other remedy there seemed, so sorely as their souls were\nwounded by longing for her.  It is not to be said that they ever\nspake to her thereof, or wittingly wearied her with signs of love;\nbut they could not so easily cover it up but that it was ever before\nher eyes.  But she suffered it all for friendship's sake and for\ntheir true service, and in all friendliness did what she might to\nsolace their grief.  Forsooth so good and true she found that father-\nkind, and the young men so goodly and kind, that she said to herself,\nhad she not another man lying in her heart, she might well have\nchosen one of those twain for her very speech-friend and true lover.\n\nThe second wooer that troubled her was the master, Jacobus, who, when\nbut three months were worn of her dwelling in her house, did all\nopenly crave her love and offer her marriage, he being a man\nunwedded.  Sore was her heart that she must needs gainsay him, so\nkind and courteous as he had been to her at their first coming\ntogether; though this indeed is sooth, that straightway, so soon as\nhe saw her, he fell into the captivity of her love.  Howsoever,\ngainsay him she needs must, and he took the naysay so hardly that he\nwas scarce like a man before her, and wept and prayed and lamented\nmany times over, till she wearied of it, and well-nigh fell to\nloathing him.  So that it came to this at last, that one day she\nspake to him and said that she might no longer bear it, but must seek\nanother house and leave his.  There then was the to-do, for he fell\non his knees before her, and kissed her feet, would she, would she\nnot, and cried out in his grief, till at last for pure weariness of\nhis folly she gave way unto him, and said that she would still abide\nthere; whereon he rose up from her and went away with all the grief\nrun off him for that time, and as glad a man to look on as you might\nsee on a summer's day.\n\nBut the next morning he came unto her again, and she thinking all was\nbegun afresh, made him no glad countenance; but he stood up before\nher and spake friendly, and said how that she was in the right of it,\nand that if they both dwelt in one house together they were like to\nhave but a weary time of it, both she and he.  But, said he, I will\nnot that thou shouldst depart out of this house, for a goodly one it\nis, and full meet for thee; it is for me to depart, and not for thee.\nI tell thee, forsooth, that I had from the first meant this house as\na gift from me to thee.  And therewith he drew from his pouch a\nscroll, which was a deed of gift of the said house, duly sealed and\nattested, and he gave it into her hands; but she was sore moved\nthereat, and at the demeanour of him that morning, and she let the\nscroll fall to the floor and wept for pity of him, and reached out\nboth her hands, and he kissed them, and then her lips also, and\nsithence he sat down beside her.  But she said:  Alas! that thou wilt\ngive me what I may not take, and wouldst have of me what I may not\ngive.\n\nBut now he waxed hotter, and said:  This once I command thee to do my\nwill, and take my gift.  It will be nought to my gain if thou take it\nnot; for I may not live in this house when thou art gone from it; and\nI swear by All-hallows that I will not let any have it to hire, nor\nwill I sell it, since thou hast made it holy by dwelling therein.\n\nYet was she sore moved by his generous fashion, and she said:  I will\ntake thy gift then, and live here in honour of thee and thy\nfriendship; for well I wot thou hadst no mind to buy me with thy\ngift.\n\nSo she spake, and he stood up stark and stern, and so departed, and\nkissed her not again; though meseems she would have suffered him had\nhe offered it.  Nay, belike had he at that moment pressed his wooing\nsomewhat masterfully, it is not so sure but she might have yeasaid\nit, and suffered him to wed her and lead her to bed; though it would\nhave gone ill both with him and with her thereafter.\n\nThenceforth dwelt Birdalone with her mother and her maidens and her\nmen in that house, and it became famous in the Five Crafts because of\nher beauty and her wisdom, which minished not, but waxed day by day;\nbut therewithal as the time wore, waxed her longing and sadness.  But\nall this she hid in her own heart, and was debonair to all about her,\nand so good to poor folk that none had a word save of blessing on her\nbeauty and her wisdom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  OF THE DEATH OF AUDREY, MOTHER TO BIRDALONE.  SHE IS\nWARNED IN A DREAM TO SEEK THE BLACK SQUIRE, AND IS MINDED TO DEPART\nTHE CITY OF THE FIVE CRAFTS, AND SEEK AGAIN THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nThus dwelt Birdalone in the Five Crafts in such rest and peace as her\nheart would let her; and dear and good friends she had about her; her\nmother first, whose love and desire for love of her made all things\nsoft and dear unto her.  Gerard and the Gerardsons were next, who\nwere ever faithful and true unto her, and deft both of hand and of\nmind, so that they wrought many things for her avail.  Then came the\nmaster, Jacobus, who held himself unwedded for her sake, and though\nhe no longer dwelt in the same house with her, might scarce endure to\nmiss the sight of her for two days running:  a dear friend she deemed\nhim, as forsooth he was, though whiles he tormented and wearied her,\nand belike had wearied her more, but for the sorrow which lay on her\nown heart, whereof it came that she might not think of any man as of\none who might be a lover, and so felt safe even with so kind a friend\nand so stubborn in his love as was this one.  Moreover he never again\ncraved love of her in so many words, but only in his goings and\ncomings so did, that it was clear how he had her, and the love of\nher, ever in his heart.\n\nWore thus a five years; and then came a sickness on the city, and\nmany died thereof; and the said sickness entered into Birdalone's\nhouse, and slew Audrey her mother, but spared all else therein.\nThereby at the first was Birdalone so overwhelmed that she might heed\nnought, neither her craft nor her friends, nor the days to come on\nthe earth for her.  And moreover when she came more to herself, which\nwas not for many days, and asked why her friend Jacobus had not been\nto see her the last days, she was told that he also was dead of the\npestilence; and she sorrowed for him sorely, for she loved him much,\nthough not in the way he would.\n\nAnd now did the city and land of the Five Crafts begin to look\nunfriendly to Birdalone, and she fell to thinking that she must needs\ndepart thence, as she well might do, whereas she had foison of goods:\nand at first it was in her mind to go with Gerard and his sons unto\nUtterhay; but then she deemed the thought of her mother, and how she\nwould be ever thinking of the loss and the gain, and the loss once\nmore stood in the way; and she turned one thing and another over in\nher mind, and might not face it.\n\nOn a night, as she slept, came to her dreams of her days in the House\nunder the Wood (as very seldom betid), and the witch-wife was\nspeaking to her in friendly fashion (as for her) and blaming her for\nfleeing away, and was taunting her with the failure of her love, and\ntherewith telling her how fair a man and lovesome was the Black\nSquire, and what a loss she had of him; and Birdalone was hearkening\nand weeping for tenderness' sake, while the witch was unto her\nneither fearful nor irksome, and forsooth nought save a mouthpiece\nfor words that both grieved Birdalone and yet were an eager pleasure\nunto her.  But in the midst thereof, and ere the dream had time to\nchange, Birdalone awoke, and it was an early morning of later spring,\nand the sky was clear blue and the sun shining bright, and the birds\nsinging in the garden of the house, and in the street was the sound\nof the early market-folk passing through the street with their wares;\nand all was fresh and lovely.\n\nShe awoke sobbing, and the pillow was wet with her tears, and yet she\nfelt as if something strange and joyous were going to betide her, and\nfor joy of the love of life the heart beat fast in her bosom.\n\nShe arose all darling naked as she was, and went to the window and\nlooked out on the beauty of the spring, while the sound of the\nmarket-wains brought to her mind the thought of the meads, and the\nstreams of the river, and the woodsides beyond the city; and she fell\na-longing for them, as a while she knelt on the window-seat, half\ndreaming and asleep again, till the sun came round that way, and its\nbeams fell upon her bosom and her arms; and she stood up and looked\non the fairness of her body, and a great desire took hold of her\nheart that it might be loved as it deserved by him whom she desired.\nAnd thus she stood there till she became ashamed, and hastened to do\non her raiment; but even as she was about it, it came upon her that\nwhat she had will to do was to seek to the Castle of the Quest, and\nfind out where was her love if there he were not, and so to seek him\nthe world over till she found him.  And such a flood of joy possessed\nher when she thought this, and so eager to begone she was, that she\ndeemed every minute wasted till she were on the road.\n\nNevertheless, in a while, when her mind was steadied, she knew that\nshe had somewhat to do ere she might be gone, and that here, as oft,\nit would be more haste less speed.\n\nSo she abode a little, and then came into her hall duly dight, and\nfound Gerard and his sons there to serve her; and she brake her fast,\nand bade them sit by her at table, as oft she did; and she spake to\nthem of this and that, and Gerard answered lightly again; but the two\nGerardsons looked at one another, as though they would speak and ask\na question from time to time, but forbore because they durst not.\nBut Gerard looked on them, and deemed he wotted what was in their\nminds; so at last he spake:  Our lady, both I, and meseemeth my sons\nalso, deem that there is some tidings toward which are great unto\nthee; for thine eyes sparkle, and the red burns in thy cheeks, and\nthine hands may not be quiet, nor thy feet abide in one place;\nwherefore I see that thou hast something in thy mind which strives to\nbe forth of it.  Now thou wilt pardon us, our dear lady, that we ask\nconcerning this, because it is in our love for thee that we speak,\nlest there be some change toward which shall be a grief to some of\nus.\n\nMy men, said Birdalone, flushing red, sooth it is that there is a\nchange at hand, and I shall tell you straightway what it is.  Years\nago I told you that I was fleeing from my friends; now the change\nhath betid that I would seek them again; and needs must I leave the\nFive Crafts behind to do so.  And moreover there is this ill word to\nbe said, which I will say at once, to wit, that when I am but a\nlittle way gone from the Five Crafts I must wend the other deal of my\njourney birdalone, as my name is.\n\nAll those three sat silent and aghast at that word, and the young men\ngrew pale; but after a while spake Gerard:  Our lady most well-\nbeloved, this word which thou hast spoken, to wit, that thou needest\nus no longer, I have looked to hear any time this five years; and\npraise be to the saints that it hath come late and not soon.  Now\nthere is no more to be said but that thou tell us what is thy will\nthat we should do.\n\nBirdalone hung her head awhile for sorrow of sundering from these\nmen; then she looked up and said:  It seemeth, my friends, as if ye\ndeem I have done you a wrong in sundering our fellowship; but all I\nmay say hereon is to pray you to pardon me, that I needs must go\nalone on my quest.  And now what I would have you do, is first of all\nto fetch hither a notary and scrivener, that he may draw up a deed of\ngift to you, Gerard and Gerardsons, of this house and all that is\ntherein, saving what money I may need for my journey, and gifts such\nas I shall bid you to be given to my workwomen.  Ye must needs yeasay\nthis, or ye are forsworn of your behest to do my will.  But\nfurthermore, I will have you to let the workwomen of mine (and the\nhead one ruling) to hire the aforesaid house, if so they will; for\nnow are they skilled, and may well earn good livelihood by the work.\nBut the next work is simple; it is to furnish for me the array of a\nyoung man, with such armour as I may easily bear, to dight me for my\nroad.  Forsooth ye wot that not unseldom do women use the custom of\ngoing arrayed like men, when they would journey with hidden head; and\nye may happen upon such gear as hath been made for such a woman\nrather than any man; but thou shalt get me also a short bow and a\nquiver of arrows, for verily these be my proper weapons that I can\ndeal with deftly.  Now my last command is that, when all is done,\nmaybe to-morrow, or maybe the next day, ye bring me out of the city\nand the frank of the Five Crafts, and bring me somewhat on my way\nover the downs, for loth am I to part from you ere needs must.  Then\nthey knelt before her and kissed her hands, and they were full of\ngrief; but they saw that so it had to be.\n\nThereafter Gerard spake with his sons apart, and in a while came to\nBirdalone, and said:  Our lady, we will do your will in all wise; but\nwe shall tell thee, that the Five Crafts will look but strange to us\nwhen thou art gone, and that we have a mind to betake us to Utterhay\nand the land of our kindred.  Wherefore we pray thee to give this\nhouse that hath been so dear to us unto thy workwoman and her mates;\nfor we need it not, nor the hire thereof, but shall do well enough\nwith what money or good thou mayst give us.  Is this according to thy\nwill, or have I spoken rashly?\n\nShe said:  Ye are good and ungreedy, and I bless you for it; be it as\nye will; and this the more, as I were fain that ye go to Utterhay;\nfor whiles I have deemed that I myself am drawn thitherward,\nwherefore it may be that we shall meet again in that place.\n\nAnd when she had so spoken, she might not refrain her tears; and the\nGerardsons turned away, for they were ashamed, both that they should\nsee her weep, or she them.  But at last she called to them and said:\nNow make we the speediest end we may of this, for sorry work is the\ntarrying of farewell; so I pray you, my friends, to go about the work\nI have bidden you.\n\nSo all was done as she would, and the day after the morrow was\nBirdalone abiding the coming of Gerard and his sons with the horses;\nand despite of the sundering of friends and the perils that belike\nlay before her, the world seemed fair to her, and life beginning\nanew.  And she made no doubt that she would soon be at the Castle of\nthe Quest, and there find all things much as she had left them; and\nthere at least would be the welcome of her dear friend Viridis.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.  OF THE SUNDERING OF BIRDALONE FROM GERARD AND HIS SONS\n\n\n\nPresently were the horses come with Gerard and his sons, and\nBirdalone gat to horse amongst them.  She was armed in a light\nhauberk, and over it a long and loose surcoat that came down beneath\nthe knee of her; and a sallet she had upon her head, wide but light,\nso that not very much of her face was to be seen.  She had made up\nher mind to this tale upon the road, when she was among folk, that\nshe was under a vow not to do off her helm for a seven days' space.\nWithal she had covered up the lovely shapeliness of her legs with\nlong boots of deer-leather, and her surcoat was wide-sleeved; she was\nwell hidden, and whereas she was a tall and strong woman, she might\nwell pass for a young man, slender and fair-faced.  She was girt with\na good sword, and Gerard had gotten her a strong horseman's bow and a\nquiver full of arrows, wherewith, as aforesaid, she knew well how to\ndeal; wherefore she was by no means without defence.\n\nSo they went their ways through the streets and out-a-gates; and it\nmust be said, that were not Birdalone's thoughts turned toward the\nCastle of the Quest, and what she should meet there, her heart had\nbeen somewhat sore at leaving the city which had cherished her so\nwell these years past; nay, as it was, the shadow of the southern\ngate, as she past thereunder, smote somewhat cold upon her, and she\nsilently bade farewell to the City of the Five Crafts with some\nsorrow, though with no fear.\n\nForth they rode then through the frank and up on to the shepherd\ncountry, and whereas their horses were of the best, and they had no\nsumpter-beast with them till they came to Upham, where they must\nneeds have victual, they made but five days of it to the place where\nthe road turned aside from the country of Mostwyke.  There then they\ndrew rein, and Birdalone lighted down from her horse, and they all,\nand they lay upon the grass and ate and drank together.\n\nBut when they were done, spake Birdalone and said:  Dear friends,\nthis is the hour and the place when we must needs part; for ye shall\ngo back again to Five Crafts, and do what I have bidden of you, and\ndo your will, and wend your ways with your livelihood unto Utterhay.\nBut as for me, I must go my ways first unto Greenford, and thence to\nseek my friends from whom erst I was fleeing when ye first became my\nfriends.  Now perchance ye will say that I have taken you up in my\nneed, and cast you aside at my pleasure; but I may only say that\nthere be at present two deals of my life, and of one of them have ye\nbeen partakers, and of the other ye may not be.  Forsooth that is a\ngrief unto me, as I suppose unto you is it a greater one.  But unto\nme also were it heavier but that my heart tells me it shall not ever\nbe so; for as I said to you some days agone, I have a hope that we\nshall yet meet again, be it in Utterhay or in some other place.  And\nnow I pray you to pardon me wherein I may have done amiss unto you,\nand begrudge it not that there be others, who indeed were first-\ncomers in regard to you, and whom I love better than you; for of your\ntruth and your good-will and loving-kindness will I bear witness\nwheresoever I may be.\n\nThen spake Gerard:  Do ye speak, my sons; for I have no grudge\nagainst her, nor aught to bewail me as to her, save, it may be, that\nI am now so well on in years that it may well befall that I shall not\nlive till the time of the meeting in Utterhay.  But I will pray thee\nthis, dear lady, that if thou come to the place where I lie dead thou\nwilt kiss my burial-stone, and sing due masses for me.  Nay, she\nsaid, but this is the worst shall betide betwixt us.\n\nThen spake Robert Gerardson:  I am not deft of speech, but this\nparting makes me bold to say this:  that from the time when first I\nset eyes on thee I have loved thee in such wise that never mayst thou\nlove me as much as I love thee, if thou hast anywhere, as I deem thou\nhast, a lover of thy body, whom thou lovest.  Now I have seen that\nfor a long while thou hast known this, and hast ever because of it\nbeen as meek and kind with me as thou mightest be.  And this hath\npartly grieved me the more, because it hath eked my longing for thee;\nand yet it hath comforted me the more, because it hath made me deem\nbetter of thee, and deem thee worthier of worship and holier;\ntherefore have thou all my blessing for it.  And now I know that thou\nsunderest from us that thou mayst go seek thy very bodily lover; and\nI say, that if the sundering had been for any lighter cause, grieved\nat heart should I have been; but since it is even so, once more I\nbless thee, and ever shall I be happy in the thought of thee; and if\never we meet again, still shalt thou find me as now I am in heart and\nin soul.\n\nShe turned to him, not dry-eyed, and said:  I know that what thou\nsayest is sooth; and thou hast guessed right as to my goings; and I\ntake thy blessing with love and joy.\n\nThen were they silent; but Giles Gerardson was struggling with words,\nfor he was slow to speech; at last he said:  I say much as saith my\nbrother:  but see thou, our lady, how ill it had gone if thou hadst\nloved one of us with an equal love; woe worth the strife then!  But\nnow I will crave this of thee, that thou kiss me on the lips, now\nwhenas we part; and again, that thou wilt do as much when first we\nmeet again hereafter.  And I tell thee right out, that if thou\ngainsay this, I shall deem it unfriendly in thee, and that those\nlovely words which thou didst speak e'en now were but words alone,\nand that thou art not as true as I have deemed thee.\n\nShe laughed amidst her tears, and said:  Dear lad, doom me not till I\nhave been found guilty!  I shall nowise naysay thee this, for I love\nthee, and now and ever shalt thou be unto me as a brother, thou and\nRobert also; for even so have ye done by me.  But thou wottest, dear\nlad, that whiles and again must sister sunder from brother, and even\nso it has to be now.\n\nThen they sat silent all four; and thereafter Birdalone arose and did\noff her sallet, and kissed and embraced Gerard and his sons, and bade\nthem farewell, and she and the young men wept.  Then she armed\nherself and gat to horse, and went her ways towards Greenford, having\nnought with her but the raiment and arms that her body bore, and her\nhorse, and some gold pieces and gems in a little pouch.  So rode she;\nand the others turned back sadly toward the Five Crafts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.  BIRDALONE COMETH TO GREENFORD, AND HEARS OF THE WASTING\nOF THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nNow came Birdalone riding into Greenford an hour before sunset on a\nday of the latter end of May; and she had no doubt but to go straight\nto the hostelry, and that the less as she had not abided there\nbefore, as hath been told.  To them that served her she told the tale\nof her vow, that she might not do off her sallet that seven days; and\nsome trowed her, and some deemed her a woman, but whereas she seemed\nby her raiment to be of condition none meddled with her.  Moreover,\nas she told her intent to ride on betimes in the morning, it mattered\nthe less unto them:  withal she gave out that she came from foreign\nparts, as sooth it was.\n\nIn the evening she sat in the hall, and with her were three chapmen\ntravelling with their wares, and two good men of the town sitting;\nand they were talking together, and were courteous and blithe, and\namidst their talk they threw many a glance at the slim and fair young\nsquire, as Birdalone seemed, and were fain to speak unto him, but\nrefrained them for courtesy's sake.  For her part, Birdalone longed\nsore to ask them somewhat of the Castle of the Quest, but the words\nclave to her throat for very fear; and she sat restless and ill at\nease.  However at last said a townsman to a chapman:  Art thou for\nthe Red Hold, Master Peter, when thou art done here?  Birdalone\nturned very pale at that word; and Master Peter spake:  Yea, surely,\nneighbour, if the folk leave aught in my packs for others to buy.  He\nspake in a jovial voice, as if he were merry, and the others all\nlaughed together, as though they were well pleased and in good\ncontentment.  And now, deemed Birdalone, would be her time to speak\nif she would learn aught; so she constrained herself at last, and\nspake, though in a quavering voice:  Meseems then, masters, this good\ntown is thriving as now?  This I ask because I am a stranger in these\nparts this long while, and now I am come back hither fain were I to\nfind the land in good peace; for I may chance to take up my abode\nhereby.\n\nThe goodmen turned to her and smiled kindly when they heard the\nsweetness of her voice; and one of them said:  Sir of the sallet, ye\nshall be content with the peace in this land, and the thriving of its\nfolk; the very villeins hereabout live as well as franklins in most\nlands, and the yeomen and vavassours are clad as if they were knights\nof a good lord's household.  Forsooth their houses are both goodly\nand easy to enter; and well is that, whereas there lacks never good\nmeat and drink on the board therein.  And moreover their women are\nfor ever seeking whatso is fair and goodly, whatso is far-fetched and\ndear-bought, whereof we chapmen also thrive, as thou mayst well deem.\nAh! it is a goodly land now!\n\nThe others nodded and smiled.  But Birdalone spake, hardening her\nheart thereto for very need:  Belike then there is a change of days\nhere, for when I last knew of the land there was little peace\ntherein.  And that will not be so long agone, said a townsman,\nsmiling, for I doubt we should see no grey hair in thine head if thy\nsallet were off it.  Birdalone reddened:  It will be some five years\nagone, said she.  Yea, yea, said the townsman, we were beginning to\nend the unpeace then, and it was the darkest hour before the dawn;\nfor five years agone we and the good knights of the Castle of the\nQuest were lying before the walls of the Red Hold.  Forsooth we\ncleared out that den of devils then and there.  What betid unto it\nafter ye won it? said Birdalone, and she trembled withal.  Said the\ntownsman:  Heard ye never of the Black Squire, a very valiant knight,\nsince thou sayest that thou hast known this country-side?  She bowed\na yeasay, for this time she found it hard to speak.\n\nWell, said the townsman, we held garrison in the Red Hold for some\nthree months, and thereafter we craved of him to come and be our\ncaptain therein; for, even after the Hold was won, there was yet a\nsort of runagates that haunted the country-side, men who had no craft\nsave lifting and slaying.  And forsooth we knew this Lord Arthur for\nthe keenest and deftest of men-at-arms; so he yeasaid our asking, and\ndid all he might herein, and forsooth that was all there was to do;\nfor he was ever in the saddle, and at the work.  Forsooth he was not\na merry man, save when he was at his busiest; and little he spake in\nhall or chamber, else had he been better beloved.  But at least by no\nman better might the land have been served.\n\nThere was silence a little, and Birdalone waxed deadly pale; then she\nstrove with herself and said:  Thou sayest he was and he was; is he\ndead then?  Said the townsman:  Not to our knowledge.  When he had\nbrought the land into good peace, which is some three years and a\nhalf agone, he went his ways from the Red Hold all alone, and we saw\nhim no more.  But some folk deem that he hath entered into religion.\n\nBirdalone's heart sickened, and she thought to herself that now all\nwas to begin again; yet she felt that the worst was over since he was\nnot dead, and she was able to think what she should do.  So she said:\nMayhappen he hath gone back to the Castle of the Quest?  Nay, nay,\nsaid the townsman, that may not be; for waste is that house now;\nthere is none dwelleth there, save, it may be, now and again a\nwandering carle or carline abideth there a day or two.  Said\nBirdalone:  How hath that befallen? or where is gone Sir Hugh, the\nGreen Knight?  Said the townsman:  We knew the Green Knight well;\nfrank and free and joyous was he; all men loved him; and his lady and\nspeech-friend, none ever saw a lovelier, and as kind as was he.  But\nwe might not keep them with us; they are gone into their own country.\nSir Hugh left the Castle of the Quest some three months after the\nBlack Squire came to us for captain, and he gave over the castle to\nSir Geoffrey of Lea, an old and wise man of war.  But not many months\nthereafter we heard that he also had departed, leaving it ungarnished\nof men; and we deem that the cause thereof is that something uncouth\nis seen and heard therein, which folk may not endure.  Is it not so,\nmy masters?\n\nThey all yeasaid that, and the talk went on to other matters.  As for\nBirdalone, though her hope to come amongst friends was so utterly\noverthrown, yet she saw not what to do save to go her ways to the\nCastle of the Quest, and see if perchance she might find any tidings\nthere.  And she said to herself, that if the worst came to the worst,\nshe would herself dwell there as an hermit of love; or, maybe, to\nface those uncouth things and see if any tidings might be compelled\nout of them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.  BIRDALONE COMETH TO THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST, HEARETH\nTHE TALE THEREOF FROM LEONARD, AND DEPARTETH THENCE BY THE SENDING\nBOAT\n\n\n\nShe arose betimes on the morrow, and was out of Greenford so soon as\nthe gates were open, and at first made all speed that she might\ntoward the Castle of the Quest; and nothing hindered her, for the\nland was verily in good peace, and she might have come there if she\nwould before sunset, for all whom she met furthered her.  But as the\nday waned her courage waned with it, so that at last she stayed some\nsix miles short of the house, and craved shelter at a yeoman's stead\nthere, which was granted her with all kindness; and they made much of\nher, and she told them her vow of the sallet, and they deemed nought\nsave that she was a young man.\n\nShe departed early in the morning with their God-speed, and while the\nday was yet young came into the meadows before the castle, and saw\nthe towers thereof rising up before her:  then she checked her horse,\nand rode on no faster than a foot's pace; yet as slow as she might\nride, needs must she get to the gate while the day was yet young.\n\nSo came Birdalone by that bower wherein she had slept that first\nnight she came to the castle; and she reined up to look on it; and as\nshe sat there gazing, came a man out from it clad as a man of\nreligion; and her heart beat quick, and she was like to fall from her\nhorse, for there came into her mind what the townsman had said, that\nthe Black Squire had gone into religion.  But the hermit came towards\nher with a cup of water in his hand, and he cast his hood aback from\nhim, and she saw at once that it was Leonard the priest, and though\nit was not the friend whom she sought, yet was she glad that it was a\nfriend; but he came and stood by her, and said:  Hail, wayfarer! wilt\nthou drink of our well and rest thee a while?  So she took the cup\nand drank of the water, looking kindly on him, while he wondered at\nthe beauty of her hand, and misdoubted him.  Then she gave him back\nthe cup and lighted down off her horse, and took the sallet from her\nhead, and spake:  I may not pass by a friend without a word; think if\nthou hast not seen me before?\n\nThen he knew her, and might not refrain him, but cast his arms about\nher and kissed her, weeping; and she said:  It is sweet to me to find\na friend after what I have been told of yonder house.  Yea, said he,\nand art thou going up thither?  Certes, said she, and why not?  Said\nhe:  They are gone, and all gone!  How and whither? said she.  But I\nmust full certainly go thither at once; I will go afoot with thee; do\nthou tether my horse till thou comest back.\n\nHe said:  But wilt not thou come back?  I know not, she said:  I know\nnought save that I would go thither; let it be enough that I suffer\nthee to go with me, and on the way thou shalt tell me what thou canst\nof the tale.\n\nThen went Leonard and tethered the horse, and they went together\nafoot to the gate; and Birdalone told what she had heard of Arthur\nand Hugh; and Leonard said:  This is true, and there is not much else\nto be said.  When the Black Squire came back from the leaguer of the\nRed Hold, and had heard before of thy departure, he was heavy of mood\nand few-spoken, and wandered about as one who might find no rest; yet\nwas he not stern with Atra, who for her part was no less heavy-\nhearted:  soothly a sad company we were, and it was somewhat better\nwhen my Lord Arthur went his ways from us; and indeed eager he was to\nbe gone; and it could be seen of him that he was fain of the toil and\nperil which they of Greenford offered him.  Then in some four months\nspake my lord Hugh that he also would be gone to a place where were\nboth a land and folk that would look friendly on him; so he went with\nmy lady Viridis and my lady Aurea, and they had Atra also with them;\nand me also they would have had, but my heart failed me to leave the\nplace where I had been so glad and so sorry with thee; death had been\nbetter; wherefore in yonder bower as in an hermitage I serve God and\nabide my time.  But though I wot nought of where is gone the Black\nSquire, I know whereto those four are gone, and it is but a seven\ndays' ride hence, and the land is goodly and peaceable, and if they\nbe not dead, most like they be there yet.  How sayest thou then, thou\ndearest and kindest, wilt thou thither to them?  For if so, I may\nwell lead thee thither.\n\nBirdalone shook her head.  Nay, she said, I deem that I am drawn\nelsewhither, but soon I shall tell thee.  Lo now the gate.  But ere\nwe enter, tell me of Sir Geoffrey of Lea, and why it was that they\nmight not abide the uncouth things, or if there were any such.  Spake\nLeonard:  Things uncouth there were, and I was called upon to lay\nthem, and I did as biddeth Holy Church in all wise, but prevailed not\nagainst them, and still were they seen and heard, till folk might\nendure it no longer.\n\nAnd what like were these things? said Birdalone, and are they yet\nseen and heard?  Said Leonard:  Strange it is, but last night I went\ninto the great hall where they mostly betid, and laid me down there,\nas whiles I do, for I fear them not, and would see if they yet\nappear; but all night came nothing at all.  As to the likeness of\nthem . . .  Then he stopped, but said presently:  Hard it is to tell\nthee of them, but needs must I.  There be two of these things; and\none is an image of a tall woman of middle-age, red-haired, white-\nskinned, and meagre, and whiles she has a twiggen rod in her hand,\nand whiles a naked short sword, and whiles nought at all.  But the\nvoice of her is cursing and blaspheming and ill-saying.\n\nSaid Birdalone:  This is then a fetch of my witch-mistress of whom I\ntold thee erst, and the image of her; what is the other?  Said\nLeonard:  I were fain not to tell thee.  Yet needs must thou, said\nBirdalone.  Dear lady, said Leonard, the other is an image of thee,\nand even most like unto thee; but whiles clad in a scanty grey coat\nand barefoot, and whiles clad in a fair green gown goodly broidered,\nand broidered shoon; and whiles all mother-naked.\n\nAnd what voice cometh from mine image? said Birdalone, smiling, yet\nsomewhat pale withal.  Said Leonard:  One while a voice of sweet\nsinging, as of a bird in the brake, and that is when thou art clad;\nand again, when thou art naked, a voice of shrieking and wailing, as\nof one enduring torments.\n\nSpake Birdalone:  And when did these wonders begin?  Said he:  Not\ntill after Sir Hugh and thy she-friends were gone hence.\n\nPondered Birdalone a little; then she said:  I see herein the malice\nof my witch-mistress; she would not send these fetches while Hugh was\nhere, lest he should turn to seeking me with all his might.  But when\nthey departed, she would have the castle waste, and then she sent\nthem, wotting that thereby she would rid her of Sir Geoffrey of Lea;\nwhile, on the other hand, I was nought so much unto him that he would\nspend all his life seeking me.  But now I deem I know so much of her\nthat I may bid thee to look on her as dead if these fetches come not\nagain within a little while.  Then mayst thou send and do Sir\nGeoffrey to wit thereof, and belike he will come back again; and fain\nwere I thereof for it will be merrier if the Castle of the Quest be\ndwelt in once more.\n\nYea, verily, said Leonard; but far merrier yet wert thou to dwell\nthere.  Nay, she said, but now I see that it is not fated for me.\nLet us go in, for I would get to what I would do.\n\nSo therewith they passed under the shadow of the archway, and\nBirdalone stayed not but went straightway into the hall, and through\nit; and the priest, who lagged somewhat behind her speedy feet, cried\nout unto her:  Whither wilt thou? what chamber wilt thou visit first?\nBut she stayed not, and spake to him over her shoulder as she went:\nFollow me if thou wilt; I have but one place only to come to ere I\nleave the Castle of the Quest, save I must needs turn back on my\nfootsteps.\n\nThen Leonard came up with her, and she went her ways out of the hall,\nand out on to the waterswale of the castle, and so to the little\nhaven of the water-gate.  There Birdalone looked about her eagerly;\nthen she turned to Leonard and pointed with her finger and said:  Lo\nthou! there yet lieth my ferry of old time, the Sending Boat; now wot\nI wherefore I was drawn hither.  And her eyes glittered and her body\nquivered as she spake.\n\nYea forsooth, said Leonard, there it lieth; who of all folk in the\ncastle had durst to touch it?  But what hath it to do with thee, O\nkindest lady?\n\nFriend, she said, if this day weareth, and I am yet within these\nwalls, then meseemeth there must I abide for evermore; and there\nperchance shall I meet that seeming of myself, maybe for this night,\nmaybe for ever, till I die here in this castle void of all that I\nlove, and I over-young for it, friend.  And I know now that there is\nhope within me; for I bethink me of a dear friend over yonder water\nof whom I have never told any, nor will tell thee now, save this,\nthat she is the wisdom of my life.\n\nWherefore now I will try this ferry and wot if the wight thereof will\nyet obey the voice of the speaker of the spell, who has shed of her\nblood to pay therefor.  Put not forth a hand therefore nor speak a\nword to let me, but take this farewell of me, with my pity and such\nlove as I may give thee, and let me go, and think kindly of me.\n\nThen she went up to him, and laid her hands upon his shoulders, and\nkissed him, and turned about without more ado and stepped into the\nboat; then she sat down and stripped her arm of its sleeve, and drew\nforth a knife and let blood of her arm, and then arose and smeared\nstem and stern therewith, and then sat down with her face to the\nstern and sang:\n\n\nThe red raven-wine now\nHast thou drunk, stern and bow;\nWake then and awake\nAnd the Northward way take:\nThe way of the Wenders forth over the flood,\nFor the will of the Senders is blent with the blood.\n\n\nThen she abode a little, while Leonard stood staring on her\nspeechless with grief and blinded with his bitter tears, till the\nboat began to move under her, and presently glided out of the little\nhaven into the wide lake; then she turned her face back unto him and\nwaved her hand, and he knelt down and blessed her, weeping.  And so\nshe vanished away from before him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.  BIRDALONE FINDETH THE ISLE OF NOTHING GREATLY BETTERED,\nAND IS KINDLY ENTREATED THERE\n\n\n\nNow it was scarce noon when she departed, and the dark night came\nupon her in the midst of the water; and she fell asleep in the boat\nere the night had grown very old, and woke up in the morning, not\nexceeding early, maybe about six o'clock; then she looked ahead and\nthought presently to see the ill-favoured blotch of the Isle of\nNothing on the bosom of the blue waters, whereas it was a fair and\ncloudless morning of latter May.  Sure enough she saw land ahead, and\nit lay low down on the water, but she deemed from the first that it\nwas green of hue, and as she neared it she saw that it was verily as\ngreen as emerald.  Thereat she was a little troubled, because she\nthought that mayhappen the Sending Boat had gone astray, and that if\nthe wight thereof were not wending the old road, maybe he was not\nmaking for the old haven.  For now indeed she told herself right out\nthat her will was to go back again to the House under the Wood, and\nsee what might betide there, and if she and the wood-mother together\nmight not overcome the witch.\n\nBut whatever might happen nought could she do but sit in her place\nand wend as the Sending Boat would; and in an hour's space she was\nright under the lee of the land, and she saw that it was shapen even\nas the Isle of Nothing had been aforetime.  But this made her wonder,\nthat now the grass grew thick down to the lip of the water, and all\nabout from the water up were many little slim trees, and some of them\nwith the May-tide blossom yet on them, as though it were a fair and\ngreat orchard that she was nearing; and moreover, beyond all that she\nsaw the thatched roofs of houses rising up.\n\nPresently then the Sending Boat had brought her to the land, and she\nstepped ashore, but was wary, and gat her bow bent and set an arrow\nthereto she began to go up from the water.  Yet she thought within\nherself, it will be nought ill if I be come amongst folk, so long as\nthey be peaceful, or else how might I live the journey out to all the\nisles and so home to the House under the Wood?\n\nSo she turned her face to where she had seen those roofs, which now\nshe saw no longer because of the thick leaves of the little trees,\nand so went along a narrow path, which grew to be more and more\nclosely beset with trees, and were now no longer apple and pear and\nquince and medlar, but a young-grown thicket of woodland trees, as\noak and hornbeam and beech and holly.\n\nAt last as she went she heard voices before her, so she stole warily\nto the edge of the copse, finger on shaft; and presently could see\nclear of the saplings and out on to a wide space of greensward,\nbeyond which was a homestead of many houses and bowers, like unto\nthat of a good yeoman in peaceful lands, save that the main building\nwas longer, though it were low.  But amidst the said greensward was a\ngoodly flock of sheep that had been but of late washed for the\nshearing, and along with the sheep four folk, two carles and two\nqueans, all of them in their first youth, not one by seeming of over\na score and two of summers.  These folk were clad but simply, man and\nwoman, in short coats of white woollen (but the women's coats a\nlittle longer than the men's), without shoon or hosen; they had\ngarlands of green leaves on their heads, and were wholly unarmed,\nsave that one of the men bore an ashen wand in his hand.  As for\ntheir bodies, they were goodly of fashion, tanned indeed by the sun's\nburning, but all sweet of flesh were they, shapely and trim, clean-\nmade, and light and slim.\n\nBirdalone's heart yearned toward them, and she stepped straightway\nfrom out of the cover of the coppice, and the sun flamed from her\nsallet and glittered in the rings of her hauberk, so that the folk\nmight not fail to see her; the sheep fled bundling from her past\ntheir keepers, who stood firm, but seemed somewhat scared, and moved\nnot toward Birdalone.  She gave them the sele of the day and stood\nstill herself; but the man with the ash-wand said:  Hail, thou man;\nbut we would have thee come no nearer a while, though thy voice be\nsweet:  for we know what things they be which thou bearest, and that\nthou art a warrior.  Wilt thou hurt us?\n\nBirdalone laughed as sweetly as the blackbird sings, and she did off\nher sallet and shook the plenteous hair down over her, and then drew\nforth her sword and dagger and cast them to earth, and laid her bow\nand quiver of arrows upon them, and said:  Now will I come to you, or\nye shall come to me, whereas I am unweaponed, and no warrior, but a\nwoman, and ye are four to one, and two of you carles; wherefore now\nye may bind me or slay me if you will; but in any case I pray you\nfirst to give me a mouthful of meat.\n\nWhen she had done her speech, she went up to the fairest of the women\nand kissed her; but the two carles made no more ado but came to\nBirdalone and kissed her one after other, and that as men who needed\nnought to compel them therein, and each thereafter took a hand of her\nand held it and caressed it.  But the other woman had run into the\nhouse as soon as Birdalone spoke, and came back again with a treen\nbowl full of milk and a little loaf, not white but brown; and there\nblundered about her legs as she came a little lad of some three\nwinters old, naked and brown, who was shy of the gleaming new-comer,\nand hid him behind the woman one while, and the other while came\nforth to see the new thing.  But the woman said:  Dear woman, here is\nfor thee some of the ewes' milk, and a bite of bread, and a little\ndeal of cheese; the said milk is yet warm, so that it is not yet\nclottered; but if thou wilt come with us thou mayest speedily drink\ncows' milk, and we be now at point to go milk them.\n\nBirdalone thanked her with a heart full of content, and was not ill-\npleased to get her hands free from the two carles; so she sat down\nand ate her breakfast while they talked with her, and told her of\ndiverse work of theirs; as to how their trees were waxing, and new\ntillage they had done the past spring, and how it befell to the kine\nand the goats; of their children also they spake, and how there were\nalready four thereof, and one of the women, the meat-bringer, already\nquickened with child once more.  So that ere we die, quoth the carle\nwho was speaking, we look to see many grandchildren, and shall have\nsome stout carles and queans here.  And by that time will some of the\ntrees be well grown, so that we may fell timber and make us some keel\nthat will wend the lake, and help us a-fishing; or we may go to other\nlands; or whiles folk may come to us, even as thou hast, thou dear-\nhanded, sweet-voiced woman.  But wilt thou abide here ever?\n\nYea, said the other, but that is looking forward a long while, that\nbuilding of ships.  What is nearer and well to think of is, that\nthese apple and pear trees be so well fruited, small as they be, that\nthis harvest we shall be able to make us cider and perry; yea, and no\nlittle deal thereof.  But art thou minded to abide with us ever?\nThat were dear to us; and belike thou wouldest bear us children, thou\nalso.\n\nThen spake the meat-fetching woman and laughed withal:  Nay, thou\nalso lookest aloof a pretty deal; whereas what is now to do is to go\nmilk the kine, and to take this guest with us, so that she may drink\nsomewhat better than ewes' milk though the cider be not ready to\nhand.  But tell me, our dear guest, art thou verily going to abide\nwith us a long while? that were sweet to us, and we will do all we\nmay to pleasure thee.\n\nNay, said Birdalone, it will no better be but that I depart on the\nmorrow; and all thanks do I give you for your kindness.\n\nThe woman kissed her, and she arose, and all they went together to\nthe milking of the kine some half mile inland; and they passed\nthrough much of orchard, and some deal of tillage, wherein the wheat\nwas already growing high; and so came they to a wide meadow through\nwhich ran a little stream, and therein was a goodly herd of kine.  So\nthey fell to the milking, and made Birdalone drink of the sweet cows'\nmilk, and then went and lay down under the shade of the little young\ntrees, and talked and were merry together.  But the men were both of\nthem somewhat willing at first to kiss Birdalone and toy with her,\nbut when she let them know that she desired it not they refrained\nthem without grudging.\n\nAll this while of their talk they asked Birdalone nought of whence\nand whither, and she would not ask them, lest it might stir their\nasking, and then she would have to tell them some deal of her story;\nand telling it was now become unto her somewhat weary work.\n\nIn a while they arose all, and the men and one woman went their ways\nto deal with the acre-land, but the meat-fetcher went back with\nBirdalone into the house; and she showed her all that was therein,\nwhich was for the more part, forsooth, the four babes aforesaid.  The\nothers came back in the eventide, bearing with them foison of blue\nhare-bells, and telling joyously how they had found them anigh the\ncoppice edge in such a place:  and thereafter they were merry, and\nsang and talked the evening away, and showed Birdalone at last to a\nfair little chamber wherein was a bed of dry grass, where she lay\ndown and slept in all content.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.  OF BIRDALONE'S FLITTING FROM THE ISLE OF NOTHING\n\n\n\nOn the morrow Birdalone arose betimes, and would not tarry despite\nall the kindness of that folk and the change which had come over the\nIsle of Nothing; so the friends saw her down to the boat all\ntogether, and bore down with them a deal of bread and cheese and late\napples of the last year, for her provision on the road, and a pail of\nmilk withal; and men and women they kissed her at departure, and the\nmeat-fetcher said:  If by any means thou mayst find a keel which will\ncarry thee hither, at some time, I would thou wouldst come; for even\nif thou be old, and we passed away, yet here shall be our children or\nour grandchildren to welcome thee; and we will tell them the tale of\nthee that they remember it and long for thee.\n\nThen Birdalone kissed her again, and made much of her, and so stepped\ninto the boat, and fell to her sacrifice to the wight thereof; and\nthose others stared at her and wondered, and spake nought unto her\ntill she was gone gliding over the face of the waters; but as they\nwalked back to the house, they spake amongst themselves that this\nmust be some goddess (for of Holy Church they knew nought) who had\ncome to visit them in her loveliness; and in after times, when this\nfolk waxed a many, and tilled all the isle and made ships and spread\nto other lands and became great, they yet had a memory of Birdalone\nas their own very lady and goddess, who had come from the fertile and\nwise lands to bless them, when first they began to engender on that\nisle, and had broken bread with them, and slept under their roof, and\nthen departed in a wonderful fashion, as might be looked for of a\ngoddess.\n\nBut as for Birdalone, she came not back ever, nor saw that folk\nagain, and now she sped over the water toward the Isle of Kings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.  COMING TO THE ISLE OF KINGS BIRDALONE FINDETH THERE A\nSCORE AND TWO OF FAIR DAMSELS WHO WOULD FAIN HAVE HER COMPANY\n\n\n\nBirdalone came ashore at the said isle at the day-dawn, and saw but\nlittle change in the isle when it grew light, and still the castle\nstood looking down awfully on to the meadows.  But when she had set\nfoot on the land, she handled her bow lest the worst might befall,\nand looked about her, deeming that this time she would not go her\nways to the dread show that was arrayed in the castle, if forsooth\nthose dead folk yet abode there.\n\nSo now as she looked across the meadow, she saw one with light and\nfluttering raiment come forth from the trees, and look toward her\nwhereas she stood flashing and gleaming in the sun like an image of\nthe God of Love turned warrior.  Now Birdalone deemed for sure that\nthis was a woman; she saw her come a little nigher to her, and then\nstand looking at her under the sharp of her hand; then she turned\nabout and ran back to the brake whence she came; and presently\nBirdalone heard the sound of voices coming thence, and in a little\nwhile thereafter came forth from the said brake a rout of women (one\nscore and two as they were told thereafter) and walked over the\nmeadow straight unto her.  She stood where she was, so as to be nigh\nunto her ferry in case they willed her unpeace; for though they were\nweaponless by seeming, they were a many.\n\nWhen they were come near they stood about her in a half ring,\nwhispering and laughing each to each.  Birdalone saw that they were\nall young, and that none of them might be called ungoodly, and some\nwere full fair.  They were bright and fine of array.  Most bore gold\nand gems on fingers and neck and arms; they were clad in light, or it\nmay be said wanton raiment of diverse colours, which had only this of\ntheir fashion in common, that they none of them hid over-much of\ntheir bare bodies; for either the silk slipped from the shoulder of\nher, or danced away from her flank; and she whose feet were shod,\nspared not to show knee and some deal of thigh; and she whose gown\nreached unsheared from neck to heel, wore it of a web so thin and\nfine that it hid but little betwixt heel and neck.\n\nBirdalone stood gazing on them and wondering, and she had a mind to\nthink that they were some show sent by her old mistress the witch for\nher undoing, and she loosened her sword in its sheath and nocked an\narrow.\n\nBut then ran forward two of the damsels and knelt before her, and\neach took an hand of her and fell to kissing it, and she felt their\nhands that they were firm and their lips that they were soft and\nwarm, and they were doubtless alive and real.  Then spake one of them\nand said:  Hail our lord!  How can words say how we rejoice in thy\ncoming this happy morn!  Now do all we give ourselves to thee as thy\nslaves to do as thou wilt with.  Yet we pray thee be merciful to us\nand our longings.\n\nTherewith all the sort of them knelt down on the grass before\nBirdalone and joined their hands as praying to her.  And Birdalone\nwas full ill at ease, and wotted not where she was.  But she said:\nHail! and good days and fulfilment of wishes unto you, fair damsels!\nBut tell me, is this the Isle of Kings, as I deemed; for strange it\nis for me to see ye womenfolk here?\n\nSaid she who had spoken afore:  Yea verily this is the Isle of Kings;\nbut long ago are the kings dead, and yet they sit dead in the great\nhall of the castle yonder, as thou mayst see if thou, who art a man\nand a valiant warrior, durst follow up yon mountain path thereto; but\nwe, weak women and little-hearted, durst not go anigh it; and we\ntremble when whiles a-nights cometh down thence the sound of clashing\nswords and clattering shields, and the cries of men in battle.  But,\npraise be to the God of Love, nought cometh down from thence unto us.\nTherefore do we live peaceful lives and pleasant here, lacking nought\nbut thee, lord; and lo now thou hast come unto us, and we are happy\nin our inmost hearts.\n\nNow was Birdalone perplexed and knew not what to do; but at last she\nsaid:  Gentle maidens, I pray you pardon me, but I must depart\nstraightway; for I have an errand, and life or death lieth on it.  In\nall else than my abiding here may ye have your will.\n\nTherewith did she move a little way toward her ferry; but forthwith\nall they brake out weeping and wailing and lamenting, and some of\nthem came up to Birdalone and cast themselves down before her, and\nclasped her knees, and took hold of her skirts, and besought her\npiteously to abide with them.  But she put them aside as well as she\nmight, and stepped aboard the Sending Boat, and stood amidst it\nwaiting on their departure; but they went not, and stood along on the\nlip of the land crying out and beseeching with much clamour.\n\nThen Birdalone waxed somewhat wrath at their noise and tumult, and\nshe drew forth her knife and bared her arm and let blood from it.\nBut when they saw the whiteness and roundness of it, and how fine and\nsleek it was, straightway they changed their tune, and cried out:  A\nwoman, a woman, a fool of a woman! and they laughed in scorn and\nmockery.  And the speaker of them said:  Now there is but one thing\nfor thee to do, and that is to come forth from thy boat and strip off\nthy stolen raiment, and we shall make thee as fine as ourselves, and\nthou shalt come with us, and with us abide the coming of our lord.\nNay, thou art so fair and lovely, that thou shalt be the Lady and\nQueen of us, and we will do after thy commands, and thou mayst\nchastise us if we fail therein.  But now if thou wilt not come forth\nof the boat uncompelled, we shall pluck thee forth of it.\n\nAnd therewith she set her foot on the gunwale of the boat, and two or\nthree others did the like.  But now had Birdalone her sword naked in\nher hand, and she waxed as red as blood, and cried out:  Forbear I\nbid you!  Yea verily I am a woman; but I will not take this offer\neither, whereas I have an errand, as I told you.  And so stern it is,\nthat if ye now let my departure I will not spare to smite with this\nsword whoso first cometh aboard my ferry, and though I be not a man,\nyet shall ye find that in this matter I shall be little worse,\nwhereas I am armed and ye be naked.\n\nThen they drew back and stood gibing and jeering at her; but she\nheeded it no whit, but reddened stem and stern of the Sending Boat,\nand sang her spell, and forth glided the ferry, while the damsels\nstood and stared astonished.  As for Birdalone, as she sped on her\nway she might not refrain her laughter.  Thus she wended the wet\nhighway.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.  BIRDALONE COMETH AGAIN TO THE ISLE OF QUEENS, AND\nFINDETH A PERILOUS ADVENTURE THEREIN\n\n\n\nIt was not yet daybreak when Birdalone came ashore again, and the\nmoon was down, and it was dark; wherefore she durst not go up on the\nland, but lay down in the ferry and fell asleep there.  When she woke\nagain it was broad daylight, the sun was up, and a little ripple was\nrunning over the face of the water.  She stepped ashore straightway,\nand looked up the land and to the right hand and the left, and saw at\nonce that it was indeed the Isle of Queens, and the house stood trim\nand lovely as of old time; then she longed somewhat to tread the\ngreen meadow a little, for yet young was the day, and she saw nought\nstirring save the throstle and a few small beasts.  However, she said\nto herself that she would go nowhere nigh to the goodly house wherein\nabode those images of death.  Yet her body longed so sore for the\nspringtide freshness of the grass, and was so bewooed of the flowery\nscent thereof, that though she durst not go unarmed, she did off her\nfootgear and went stealing softly barefoot and with naked legs over\nthe embroidered greensward, saying aloud to herself:  If run for the\nferry I needs must, lighter shall I run so dight.\n\nNonetheless, she had gone but a little way ere a terror took hold of\nher, though she saw no child of Adam anigh, and she turned and ran\nback swiftly to her old place and sat down under a twisted oak-tree\nhard by the Sending Boat, and abode there panting and quaking, and\nscarce daring to look up from the grass for a while.  Then her heart\ncame back to her, and she laughed, and said to herself:  I am a fool,\nfor I need fear nought on this Isle of Queens save women like myself.\n\nYet she sat there a little while longer without stirring; then she\nstood up and looked keenly around, and, as aforesaid, exceeding far-\nsighted she was; but still she saw neither man nor maid nor suckling\nchild.\n\nThen her eyes sought the lips of the lake, and rested on a little\nbight some stone's throw ahead of the Sending Boat, where, a little\nback from the water, slim willows made a veil betwixt the water of\nthe meadow; and she looked, and saw how pleasant a place it were for\na one to stand and look on the ripple just left, while the water\ndripped from the clear body on to the grass.  And her bare feet fell\nto telling her clad sides of the sweet coolness of the water, and\nwaited for no naysay, but lightly bore her toward the willowy bight.\nAnd when she was there, she did off her sallet and ungirt her, and\nlaid her sword on the grass, and did off her surcoat and hauberk, and\nso was a woman again in one white coat above her smock.  Then she\nlooked heedfully betwixt the willow-boughs, and saw no more than\nbefore, nought but a little whitethorn brake, now white indeed with\nblossom, some fifty yards landward from where she stood.  So she\nlaughed, and did off her other raiment, and slid swiftly into the\nwater, that embraced her body in all its fresh kindness; and as for\nBirdalone, she rewarded it well for its past toil by sporting and\nswimming to her full.\n\nThen she came forth from the water, and clad herself in no great\nhaste, and did on her hauberk and sallet and sword, and so went back\nto her place, and sat down and began to do on her foot-gear.\n\nBut as she looked up from her work a moment, lo! a tall man coming\ntoward her, and just about the willows whereby she had bathed.  Her\nheart beat quick and her face changed, yet she hastened, and was shod\nand stood up in knightly array by then he stayed his steps some five\npaces from her, and gave her the sele of the day in courteous wise;\nand she strove to think that he had not seen her, or at least noted\nher otherwise dight; yet her heart misgave her.\n\nHe was a grizzled-haired man of over fifty summers by seeming, but\ngoodly enough and well-knit; he was clad in a green coat more than a\nlittle worn, but made after the fashion of knighthood; he had nought\non his head but an oak-chaplet, and no weapons but a short sword by\nhis side and a stout staff in his hand.\n\nShe gave back his greeting in a quavering voice; and he said:\nWelcome again, young man.  Art thou come to dwell with us?  Truly\nthou art trim now, but ere some few months thine attire will be not\nso much fairer than ours, and thine hauberk will be rusted, for here\nbe no joyous tiltings nor deeds of arms, and no kind ladies to give\nthe award of honour, so that if we fight amongst ourselves it will be\nbecause we have fallen out, and spitefully.  Yet (and he laughed,\nmockingly, as she thought) thou mayst bring us luck, and draw some\nfair damsels unto us, for that is what we await in this isle, which\nis barren of their fair bodies, despite of its deceitful name.\n\nThereat Birdalone reddened, deeming that he divined her womanhood,\nbut she enforced her to speak hardily, and as manly as she might, and\nsaid:  Yea, fair sir, and if I be the God of Love, as thou deemest,\nand not merely a poor squire (Louis Delahaye, at thy service), how\nmany damsels shall I send thee if there must needs be one to each man\nof you?  Quoth he:  Thou must make up the tale to a score or more, or\nsome of us must lack.  Sooth to say, at this time thou needest not\nhaste overmuch for all the tale, whereas there is but one other of\nthe company near at hand, a mere foolish young man; the others are\ngone to the leeward side of the isle, to fetch us venison and fish,\nboth of which are more plenty there than here; wherefore are we two\nsomewhat lonesome in this stead, all the more as we be over-nigh to\nthe sorcery in the great house, which we durst not enter; for though\nnought cometh out thence down unto us, yet hear we a-night-tides,\nfirst songs, and then cries and shrieking, come out therefrom.\n\nThen he stayed his speech, and drew a little nigher to Birdalone, and\nthen grinned, and said:  Forsooth we can spare him, we twain.  And he\nlooked on her hard, and the colour came into her cheeks, and she\nlaughed uneasily, as a dainty lady when she heareth some unmeet tale.\n\nBut again the old carle drew nigher to her, and said:  Thou seemest\nto have a good bow and store of arrows; if thou wouldst lend them to\nme for a little, and come with me into the wood hard by, I might\nshoot thee some venison with little toil to thee; whereas, forsooth,\nthou lookest scarce like one who is meet for over-much toil.  Again\nshe reddened, and spake nought this time; and he said:  Deem not\nthere be no deer this end of the isle because I said that the others\nwere gone to fetch home venison; only the deer be tamer there and\nmore, and we have but evil shooting-gear, whereas thou art well found\ntherein.  Wilt thou not come? we shall have merry feast after the\nhunt.\n\nNow had Birdalone come to her wits again, and she answered like a\nmerry youth, with a flavour of mockery in her speech:  Fair sir, thou\nshalt not deem that I need much help in slaying the dun deer; for I\ndo thee to wit that I shoot not ill in the bow; neither am I heavy-\nfooted.  But I will not hunt in your park to-day, for I have an\nerrand which calleth me away, so that I shall depart hence presently.\nBesides, wise elder, there is thine errand to see to; and if I be the\nGod of Love, as thou sayest, I must not keep thee and thy valiant\nfellows languishing mateless; so with thy leave I will now depart,\nthat I may send you a score of fair damsels for your company.\n\nAnd she turned about and made a step toward her boat; but the carle\ndrew nearer, laughing; and he said:  Truly sayest thou that thou art\nnot heavy-footed, for never saw I feet lighter or fairer than glided\nover the meadow e'en now; nor a fairer body than came like rosy-\ntinted pearl fresh out of the water while I lay hidden in yonder\nthorn-brake that while.  Wherefore trouble not thyself to bring any\nmore damsels than thyself, fairest Goddess of Love, for thou art\nenough for me.\n\nAnd therewith he ran forward, and stretched out a hand to her; but in\nthat nick of time had she her sword naked in her hand, and the carle\ndrew back before the glitter thereof, and cried out:  Ho, ho! is it\nto be battle, my mistress?  Deemest thou that thou wilt slay me as\nlightly as the dun deer, and thou with thy bow unstrung at thy back?\nNow shall I show thee a trick of fence; but fear not that I shall\nhurt thee to spoil thee.\n\nHe advanced on her with his staff aloft, and her heart failed her,\nand she quaked, and lightly he beat down her guard and did the sword\nout of her hand; and again he turned on her to take her, but she\nsprang aside and ran from him, but ran landward perforce, as he was\nbetwixt her and the boat; and he followed heavily, and had nought to\ndo in the race.\n\nBut she had not gone a two-score yards ere she heard a great shout,\nand another man came running over the meadow; a slim young man was\nthis, and worse of attire than the old carle, for so tattered was his\nraiment that he was half naked; but he was goodly of fashion, fresh-\ncoloured and black-haired.  Birdalone stayed her feet when she saw\nhim, for though she doubted not to outrun him, yet whither should she\nrun, since her ferry was behind her?\n\nSo the young man came up to her, and the old carle met him all\npanting, and the young man said:  How now, Antony! what battle is\nthis? and wherefore art thou chasing this fair knight?  And thou,\nfair sir, why fleest thou this grey dastard?\n\nSaid Antony:  Thou art but a young fool, Otter, this is no man, but a\nwoman, and I have taken her, and she is mine.\n\nWell, said Otter, I say she is as much mine as thine; nay, more, if\nshe will give herself unto me.  But if she will not, she shall go\nwhither she will in thy despite.  Or art thou a woman?\n\nYea, yea, said Birdalone; and I pray thee, by thy mother's head,\nsuffer me to depart; for heavy and full of need is the errand that I\nam about.\n\nGo thou shalt then, said Otter; lead back to thy place, and I will\nwalk with thee.  So did they:  and Birdalone went beside the young\nman quaking; but he put out no hand unto her; and sooth to say, she\ndeemed that she had seldom seen so fair a young man, but it were\nArthur or Hugh.\n\nNow he, as Antony, was girt with a short sword, but he let it be in\nits sheath; and as they went, Antony drew his blade again, and hove\nit up to smite Otter, but as it befell Birdalone saw him, and turned\nround sharp upon him and gat hold of his wrist, and therewith Otter\nturned also, and caught the old carle by the nape as he turned away,\nand put a foot before his and shoved mightily, so that he went\nnoseling to the earth.\n\nThen turned Otter about again, laughing, and he said to Birdalone:\nBy Saint Giles! thou art well-nigh too valiant for a woman, and I\nwould that we two might be together; and then between us we might\nachieve the adventure of the dead ladies up yonder.  She hung her\nhead, and said:  Fair sir, it may not anywise be; yet I thank thee, I\nthank thee.\n\nSo came they to the water-side and the Sending Boat, and Birdalone\nstayed her feet there, and the young man said:  What is this keel,\nthat seemeth unto me as if it were a ferry for malefactors wending to\na death of torment, so grey and bleared and water-logged and sun-\nbleached as it is, and smeared over with stains of I know not what?\n\nSaid Birdalone:  Such as it is, it is my ferry over the water to\nwhere I would be.  Strange! said Otter; to my mind it is like to our\nfortunes on this isle, we who were once knights and merry squires and\nare now as gangrel men, and of ill conditions, thinking of nought\nsave our first desires, even those which we share with the wolf and\nthe kite.\n\nShe said:  But art thou of evil conditions, thou who hast just\ndelivered me from trouble?  He smiled grimly:  Damsel, said he, I\nhave not delivered thee yet from me, though I have from him.  But\ntell me, art thou a sorceress?  Not a black one, said Birdalone; but\nI will tell thee at once that I have been bred by a witch most\nmighty, and some deal of lore have I learned.  And therewith she told\nhim of the Sending Boat, and how she would have to speed it on the\nway.\n\nHe looked on her a little and then turned away, and saw her sword\nlying on the grass; so he went to it and picked it up and brought it\nto her, and said:  Thou mayst yet need this keen friend.  So she took\nit and thrust it back into the scabbard, quaking somewhat because of\nhim; so feeble and frail as she felt before him.  Then he said:  If\nthou deemest thou hast somewhat to reward me for, I have a boon to\nask of thee, and granting that, we shall be quits again.  Yea, she\nsaid faintly, and what is the boon?  He said:  Art thou pressed to\ndepart now, this minute?  Nay, said Birdalone, not for an hour if\nthere be no peril here from other men, and . . . and . . .  And if I\nbe true to thee and will let thee go? said he, laughing; hah! is that\nnot thy word? fear not, I swear by thine eyes that thou shalt depart\nwhenso thou wilt.  Now then, the boon I crave is, that thou wilt sit\ndown here beside me and tell me the tale of thy life that has been.\nSaid she:  It wearies me to think thereof; yet hast thou a right to\ncrave somewhat of me, and this is not hard to grant.\n\nAnd she sat down by him; but he said:  Do this also for me, take off\nthine headpiece, since now that we know thee for a woman it serveth\nthee nought.  So did she, and began her tale straightway, and told\nhim all thereof, save as to the wood-wife, and he sat hearkening and\nwatching her face; and when she had made an end, he said:  Now shall\nI ask none other boon of thee, though I long sore for it; but best it\nis that we sunder straightway, else maybe I might yet be for\nhindering thee.\n\nTherewith he stood up, and Birdalone also, and he looked on her\neagerly, and said:  I am now to bid thee farewell, and it is most\nlike that I shall never see thee again, wherefore I will ask thee yet\nto let one thing come from thy mouth; for I deem thee the dearest of\nall women I have ever seen.  What shall I say? said Birdalone,\nsmiling on him kindly; must thou needs put the word in my mouth?\nThou hast been friendly with me here when need was to me of\nfriendliness; wherefore I say, I would I might see thee again, and\nthou better bestead than now thou art.\n\nThe young man's face brightened, and he said:  Spake I not that thou\nwert the dearest of all?  This was even the word I would have put in\nthy mouth.  But now see thou, one goeth on from one thing to another,\nand I must now ask thee, is there aught which thou hast a mind to\ngive me ere I depart, some keepsake which I durst not ask for?\n\nShe flushed red and said:  I will with a good heart give thee my bow\nand arrows for a keepsake; whereas the old carle told me that ye be\nill furnished of shooting-gear.\n\nAnd she would have taken her bow from her back, but he laughed aloud,\nand said:  Nay, nay, I will not have that; for there be those who\ngird them to a sword and know not how to use it, but few will cumber\ntheir shoulders with bow and quiver who cannot shoot therewith; I\ndeem it like that thou art a fell bowman.  Keep thy bow therefore,\nand if thou wilt go without any other gift, even so be it.\n\nAnd he made as if he would turn away; but she put forth both her\nhands and took his in them, and lifted up her face and kissed him\nkindly, and then turned away to her ferry; while Otter stood still\nand said in a merry voice:  Now is it better than well, for thou art\nin all ways what I would have thee, and there is nought like unto\nthee.  And therewith he turned away and departed ere Birdalone had\nstepped into the Sending Boat, and she blushing like a rose the\nwhile.  Then she did due sacrifice to the wight of the witch-ferry,\nand sped on her way without any hindrance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.  COMING TO THE ISLE OF THE YOUNG AND THE OLD, BIRDALONE\nFINDETH IT PEOPLED WITH CHILDREN\n\n\n\nMidst all this had worn some hours, but yet it was barely noon;\nwherefore it was yet dark by then Birdalone made the Isle of the\nYoung and the Old; so she stepped out of the boat, and lay down on\nthe grass and abode the dawn sleeping.  And she awoke with the\nclatter of shrill voices, and she rose up and looked, and lo a\nmultitude of children all about her, both men and women children,\nand, as it seemed, from five years old upward to fifteen.  They cried\nand crowed merrily when they saw her stand up, and pressed on her to\nsee her the nearer and to touch her hands or her raiment.  They were\nbut little clad, and the younger ones not at all, but were goodly\nyounglings and merry.  So great was the noise they raised, that loud\nwere the thunder which had not been hushed thereby; and Birdalone\nstood looking on them, smiling, and knew not what to do.  Anon she\nturned to a tall thin lad of some fifteen winters, and said unto him:\nWilt thou now take me unto the house, and the place where dwelleth\nthe old man?  Quoth he:  I neither know of an old man, nor rightly\nwhat it means, the word.  Am not I old enough for thee?  I am the\noldest of these here.  But belike thou art hungry; wherefore if thou\ncome to the place where we sleep a-nights, and where we shelter us\nfrom the storm and the rain when need is, I will give thee to eat;\nfor we have both bread and milk and cheese, and raisins of the sun.\n\nSo he took her hand and led her along, and asked her by the way\nconcerning her armour and weapons, and of the fashion of battle, and\nshe told him thereof what she would.\n\nThus came they to the place where erst had been the cot under the\nruin of the great ancient house; but now was gone all that ruin and\nthe great grey walls, though the cot was left; and all about it were\nlow bowers built of small wood and thatched undeftly.  But the lad\nsmiled when he saw it, as if the sight thereof made him happy; and he\nsaid:  All these have we made since I have dwelt here, and no other\nhome have I known.\n\nAnd he led her into the cot, and set her down to eat and to drink,\nand through the open door she could see the children swarming, and\nthey that were nighest thrusting each other this way and that to\ncatch a sight of her.\n\nNow she said:  Fair child, how gattest thou this victual if there be\nno older folk to help you?  Said he:  We dig the ground and sow it,\nand the wheat comes up, and we reap it in harvest, and make bread of\nit; and we have goats and kine, and we milk them, and turn the milk\nwith a little blue flower, which is fair to see.  And there are in\nthis isle little hills where the grapes grow plenty; and some we eat\nand some we dry for store.  Lo thou, such be our ways for victual.\nBut tell me, said he, thou sayest old, and I know not the word; art\nthou old?  She laughed:  Not very, said she, yet older than thou.\n\nSaid the lad:  Thou art fair and dear to look on, and thy voice is\nsweet; wilt thou not abide with us, and teach us what it is to be\nold?  Nay, said she, I may not, for I have an errand which driveth me\non; wherefore I must be gone within this hour.\n\nForsooth, she was growing eager now to be done with her journey and\ncome to the House under the Wood, whatever should befall her there.\nMoreover she deemed it would not be restful to her to abide among all\nthese restless children, with their ceaseless crying and yelping:  if\nrest she might, she would rest, she deemed, in the Isle of Increase\nUnsought, if there were no ill things abiding there.\n\nWherefore now she arose, when she had sat hearkening the sound of the\nlad's prattle for a while, for as to the sense thereof she might not\nheed it over-much.  The youngling would not leave her, but led her,\nholding her hand, down to her ferry again; she kissed him in thanks\nfor his meat, and he reddened thereat but said nought.  All the whole\nrout of little ones had followed her down to the water, and now they\nstood, as thick as bees on a honeycomb, on the bank, to watch her\ndeparture.  But if they were keen to see her doings before, how much\nkeener were they when it came to the baring of her arm and the\nsmearing of the Sending Boat.  To be short, so keen were they, and\npushed and shoved each other so sturdily, that more than one or two\nfell into the water, and Birdalone was frighted lest they should\ndrown; but they swam like ducks, and got on to the land when they\nwould, which was not so very soon, for some of them hung unto the\ngunwale of the boat, and hove their faces up to look over into it,\nand left not hold till the ferry was fairly under weigh and beginning\nto quicken its speed.\n\nSo left Birdalone the isle, and nought befell her on the way to the\nIsle of Increase Unsought.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.  THE SENDING BOAT DISAPPEARETH FROM THE ISLE OF INCREASE\nUNSOUGHT, AND BIRDALONE SEEKETH TO ESCAPE THENCE BY SWIMMING\n\n\n\nIt was as before that Birdalone came to the shore of the isle while\nit was yet night; but the wizard keel was so loathsome to her, that\nshe stepped out of it and laid her down on the land for what was left\nof the night; yet hard she found her bed, and neither grassy nor\nflowery.\n\nFor all that, she slept, for she was weary, and it was broad day and\nnot very early when she awoke.  She stood up trembling, for she\nforeboded evil, so near as she was to the dwelling of her old\nmistress; and she looked up to where in time past was the fair and\nwicked house, and saw that all was changed indeed; for no longer was\nthe isle goodly with meadow and orchard and garden, but was waste and\nbare, and nought grew on it save thin and wiry grass, already seeding\neven ere June was born, and here and there hard and ugly herbs, with\nscarce aught that might be called a flower amongst them.  Trees there\nwere yet, but the most of them stark dead, and the best dying fast.\nNo beasts she saw, nor fowl; nothing but lizards and beetles, and now\nand again a dry grey adder coiled up about a sun-burned stone.  But\nof great carrion flies, green and blue, were there a many, and whiles\nthey buzzed about her head till she sickened with loathing of them.\nAll this she found on her way as she went up toward the place where\nerst was the great perron.  But when she came to the top there was no\nsign either of the stairs or the house, or aught that ever was\nbuilded; there was nought but the bare bent top, ungrassed, parched\nby wind, scorched by sun, washed by rain.\n\nShe wandered about the isle, to places where she had not been\nherself, but which she deemed she might have known by the telling of\nthe Green Knight's tale, had there been no change since those days;\nbut now was all changed, and the whole isle was a mere waste, and\nwithal poisonous of aspect to her mind, as if many corpses lay\nunderneath the wretched stones of it.  Nevertheless, though it seemed\nso evil unto Birdalone, she lingered on it, wandering about till she\nwas to-wearied, for she had no will to depart at such time as she\nwould be like to come to her old abiding-place by night and cloud;\nwherefore she dallied with the time, and came not back to the haven\nof her ferry till it was nigh sunset, and the westering sun was in\nher eyes when she came there; and she said to herself that this was\nthe cause why she might not see the Sending Boat.\n\nSo she cleared her eyes and looked on the thin grass awhile, and then\ndown over the edge of the land, and still she saw not her boat.  She\nturned pale, and a pang of anguish went to her heart; but she walked\na little east, deeming that perchance she had erred as to the place\nof the haven on that dull and empty shore; but yet there was no boat.\nThen she turned back wild with terror, and sought where erst she had\nmissed it, and found neither boat nor the world's end.  And she\ndeemed that there might be some devilish malice of the wight of the\nSending Boat, to torment her with fear, and she walked along the\nland's edge up and down, and down and up, further each time, and\nstill there was no boat.\n\nThen she stood still and strove to think, and might not, nor might\nshe do aught, but spread abroad her hands and moaned in her agony;\nfor now indeed she felt herself in the trap; and she said that all\nher past life of hope and desire and love and honour was all for\nnought, and that she was but born to die miserably in that foul ruin\nof an isle envenomed with the memories of bygone cruelty and shame.\n\nBut in a little while she came somewhat to herself, and she said:  At\nleast this hideous land shall not mock my dying anguish; I will give\nmyself to the water and let it do with me as it will.\n\nTherewith she cast off her helm and hauberk first, and her weapons,\nand her pouch with the treasure that could buy nought for her now,\nand thereafter all her raiment, till she was as naked as when she\nfirst came aland there that other time.  Again she moaned, and put up\nher hand to her bosom and felt a little gold box lying there betwixt\nthe fragrant hills of her breasts, which hung to a thin golden thread\nabout her neck; and a thought came into her mind, and she stooped\nadown and drew from her pouch flint and fire-steel, and then opened\nthe said golden box and drew thence the tress which Habundia the\nwood-wife had given to her those years agone, and all trembling she\ndrew two hairs from it, as erst she did on the Isle of Nothing, and\nstruck fire and kindled tinder and burnt the said hairs, and then\nhung the golden box with the tress therein about her neck again; and\nshe said:  O wood-mother, if only thou couldst know of me and see me,\nthou wouldst help me!\n\nThereafter she sought along the bank for bread which she had taken\nfrom her store that morning, and she found it, and compelled herself\nto eat of it for the strengthening of her body, and then she stood\nand abode tidings; and by then the sun had just sunk below the rim of\nthe lake, and the stars began to twinkle, for the night was\ncloudless, and exceeding fair, and very warm.\n\nNo visible token came to her, but her heart grew stronger, and she\nseemed to see herself yet alive and in hope on the other side of the\nwater; and she said:  Who wotteth what Weird may do, or where the\nwaters may bear me? and there is no swimmer stronger than I.\n\nSo then without more ado Birdalone slipped into the water, which lay\nbefore her as calm and plain as a great sheet of glass, and fell to\nrowing with her arms and her legs as though she were but swimming\nfrom Green Eyot to the mainland, as so oft she had done in the other\ndays.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.  BIRDALONE LACKETH LITTLE OF DROWNING, BUT COMETH\nLATTERLY TO THE GREEN EYOT\n\n\n\nOn swam Birdalone, not as one who had a mind to drown her for the\nforgetting of troubles, but both strongly and wisely; and she turned\nover on to her back, and looked on the stars above her, and steered\nherself by them thitherward whereas she deemed was the land under the\nwood.  When she had been gone from the evil isle for an hour or so,\nthere rose a fair little wind behind her, which helped her forward,\nbut scarce raised the water more than a little ripple.\n\nStill she swam on, and it was some three hours she began to weary,\nand then she floated on her back and let the wind and water have its\nway with her; and now the night was as dark as it would be ere dawn.\n\nThus it went for another hour, that whiles she swam on and whiles she\nfloated; and now her heart began to fail her, and the great water was\nno longer unto her a wet highway, but a terrible gulf over which she\nhung fainting.\n\nNevertheless she did not give up doing what she might:  she floated\nsupine a long while, and then, when she had gathered a little\nstrength, turned over again and struck out, still steering her by the\nstars.  But she had scarce made three strokes ere her arms met\nsomething hard and rough; and at first in her forlornness she deemed\nshe had happened on some dread water monster, and for terror of it\nshe sank down into the deep, but came up presently blinded and\nbreathless, and spread abroad her arms, and again they came on the\nthing aforesaid, and this time found that it was nought alive, but\nthe bole of a tree sitting high out of the water.  So she clomb up on\nto it with what might she had left, and sat her down, and saw in the\ndim light that it was big, and that there was a fork betwixt two\nlimbs reaching up into the air, and she thrust herself in between\nthese two limbs and embraced one of them, so that she might scarce\ntumble off; and a great content and happiness came over her that she\nhad thus escaped from the death of the deep; but therewithal\nweariness overcame her, and she slept, whether she would or not; and\nthe bole went on over the waters no slower than might have been\nlooked for, whether it were by the pushing on of the south wind, or\nby the hand of Weird that would not have her die.\n\nLong she slumbered, for when she awoke it was broad day and the sun\nwas shining high in the heavens, and she cleared her eyes and looked\naround, and saw before her the land, but yet blue in the offing.  And\nthe tree-bole was yet speeding on towards the shore, as if it were\nbeing drawn there by some bidding of might.\n\nNow indeed grew Birdalone happy, and she thought if any had helped\nher it must have been the wood-mother once again; and she said to\nherself that she should soon meet with that helper; nor heeded she\nthat she was naked and unfurnished of any goods, whereas she deemed\nindeed that it was but to ask and have of her friend.\n\nFor a while indeed she knew not whither she was wending, and if her\nface were verily turned toward the land under the wood; but as the\nmorning wore the blue distance began to grow green, and then she saw\nthat a great wood was indeed before her, and thereafter, as it\ncleared yet more, she knew the land she was nearing for the meadows\nof the House under the Wood, and it was not long thence ere she saw\nclear and close Green Eyot and Rocky Eyot, though the house was yet\nhidden from her by the green shores of the first of those two isles.\n\nShortly to tell it, her tree-bole floated with her past the outer\nness of Green Eyot, and came ashore in that same sandy bight where\nerst she was wonted to make her body ready for the water.  She\nstepped ashore all glad to feel the firm warm sand underneath her\nfoot-soles, and as one drunk with joy she was when the tall flowery\ngrass of the latter May was caressing her legs as they shook the\nseed-dust off the bents, and smote the fragrance out of the blossoms;\nand she might scarce at first lift her eyes from their familiar\nloveliness.  Glad she was indeed, but exceeding worn and weary with\nthe long voyage, and all the longing and fear and hope which had\nencompassed her that while.  She lifted up her eyes but once, and saw\nthe witch's house standing where it was wont, but no shape of man\nmoving about it; then she turned aside to a little brake of thorn and\neglantine in the meadow hard by, and laid her down on the grass in\nthe shade thereof, and almost before her head touched the ground she\nfell asleep, and slept there long and peacefully.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.  BIRDALONE FINDETH HER WITCH-MISTRESS DEAD\n\n\n\nIt was some while after noon when she wakened, and the sun was\nshining bright and hot.  Somewhat she felt the burden of fear upon\nher, even before she was fully come to herself, and knew not what it\nwas that she feared; but when she called to mind that it was even the\nmeeting with her old mistress, her flesh quaked indeed with the\nmemory of bygone anguish, but valiantly she arose and faced the\ndwelling of the witch despite her naked helplessness.  As she went\nshe looked up unto it, and saw no smoke coming from the chimney, but\nmarvelled little thereat since it was not yet cooking-time and the\nweather hot.  She drew nigher, and saw someone sitting on the bench\nwithout the door whereas the witch was wonted; and her heart beat\nquick, for she saw presently that it was none other than her\nmistress.  Moreover, near to her stood three of the milch-kine lowing\nuneasily and as in reproach, even as such beasts use when their\nudders be full and they desire to be milked.\n\nBirdalone stayed a minute, and her legs nigh failed her for fear, and\nthen because of the very fear she hastened on till she came within\nten paces of the said witch; and sore she missed her bow and arrows,\nand the cutting blade of her feigned squirehood, lest the carline\nshould arise and come raging and shrieking at her.\n\nThen spake Birdalone in no feeble voice, and said:  Dame, I am come\nback unto thee, as thou seest, in even such plight as I fled from\nthee; and I have a mind to dwell in this land:  what sayest thou?\nThe witch neither moved nor spake at her word; and the kine, who had\nheld silence when she first came up, and had turned from her, fell to\ntheir peevish lowing again.\n\nBirdalone drew a step nigher, and said:  Dost thou hear me, dame, or\nart thou exceeding wroth with me, and art pondering what vengeance\nthou wilt take on me?  Still no answer came from the carline, and the\nkine kept on lowing now and again.  Once more Birdalone drew nigher,\nand spake loudly and said:  Tell me at least, is it peace between us\nor unpeace?\n\nBut now when she looked she saw that the eyes of the witch were open\nand staring, and her lips white, and her hands hard writhen; and she\ncried out and said:  Is she dead? or will she waken presently and\nbeat me? surely she is dead.  And she put forth her hand and touched\nher face, and it was stone-cold; and she found that she was dead\nbeyond any question.\n\nThen was a great weight lifted off her heart, and she turned about\nand looked on the meadows and up to the trees of the wood and down to\nthe rippling stream before her, and fair and sweet and joyous were\nthey gotten unto her; and she looked at the kine who were drawing up\ntowards her, and she laughed merrily, and went to the out-house hard\nby and took forth a milking-pail and a stool and fell to milking them\none after the other, and the beasts went off down the meadow lowing\nin a changed voice, for joy to wit, this time.  But Birdalone knelt\ndown and drank a long draught of the sweet warm milk, and then arose\nand went swiftly into the house, and saw nought changed or worsened\nso far as she could see.  There was her own bed in the corner, and\nthe mistress's, greater and much fairer, over against it; and the\nhutch by the door wherein the victual was kept:  she opened it now,\nand found three loaves there on the shelf, and a meal-tub down below,\nand she took a loaf and broke it and fell to eating it as she walked\nabout the chamber.  There was her bow standing in a nook beside the\nhutch, and the quiver of arrows hanging on the wall above it.  There\nwas the settle lying athwart from the hearth; and she smiled, and\nfitted her wrists to the back of the carven bear which made its\nelbow, whereto the witch was wont to tie them when she chastised her.\n\nThen she went to the coffers that stood against the wall behind it,\nand threw up the lid of one of them, and found therein a smock or two\nof her own, yellowed by the lapse of time, and her old grey coat,\nragged as it was when last she wore it, and now somewhat moth-eaten\nwithal; and she drew forth both smocks and coat and laid them on the\nsettle.  Then she opened another coffer, and therein were gay and\ngaudy gowns and gear of the witch's wear; but lying amongst them, as\nif the witch had worn them also, her green gown and shoon which her\nown hands had broidered.  But she said:  Nay, ye have been in ill\ncompany, I will wear you not, though ye be goodly, at least not till\nye have been fumigated and hallowed for me.\n\nTherewith she turned back to the settle and did on her her old smock\nand her ragged grey coat, and said:  To-day at least will these be\ngood enough for to-day's work.  And she knit her brow withal, and\nwalked with a firm step out-a-doors and stood a while gazing on the\ndead corpse of her enemy; and she thought how that here was that\nwhich once was so great a thing unto her for the shaping of her life-\ndays, and which so oft came to her waking thoughts after she had\nescaped from her hands, (though, as aforesaid, she seldom dreamed of\nher a-night-time), and moreover an hour ago she yet feared it so sore\nthat she scarce might stand for the fear of it; and now it was nought\nbut a carven log unto her.\n\nBut she told herself that the work was to be done; so she dragged the\nbody away thence, and across the brook, and a little way into the\nmeadow, and then she went back and fetched mattock and spade from the\nouthouse, where she knew they lay, and so fell to digging a grave for\nthe corpse of her dead terror.  But howso hard she might toil, she\nwas not through with the work ere night began to fall on her, and she\nhad no mind to go on with her digging by night.  Wherefore she went\nback into the house, and lighted candles, whereof was no lack, and\nmade her supper of the bread and the milk; and then sat pondering on\nher life that had been till the passion arose in her bosom, and the\ntears burst out, and long she wept for desire of others and pity for\nherself.  Then she went to the bed she had been erst wont to, and\nlaid her down and fell asleep.\n\nAnd her mistress walked not, nor meddled with her peace; nor did\nBirdalone so much as dream of her, but of her mother and Master\nJacobus in the fair city of the Five Crafts; and in her sleep she\nwept for thinking of them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.  BIRDALONE LAYETH TO EARTH THE BODY OF THE WITCH, AND\nFINDETH THE SENDING BOAT BROKEN UP\n\n\n\nWhen morning was, Birdalone awoke, and felt a weight upon her heart,\nand called to mind the task which lay before her.  So she arose and\nclad herself, and went straight to the grave begun, and toiled hard\ntill she had digged it out deep, and sithence she dragged the witch\nthereinto and heaped the earth upon her.  Then she bathed her in the\nnighest pool of the brook, and went back into the house and made her\nbreakfast on the bread and milk, and it was then about mid-morning.\nThereafter she went about the house, and saw to the baking of bread,\nand so out to the meadow to see to the kine and the goats, and then\nstored the milk for making butter and cheese, and did in all wise as\nif she were to dwell long in that stead; but thereafter she rested\nher body, whiles her thought went wide about.  But she said to\nherself that she would not go up to the Oak of Tryst to meet the\nwood-mother that day, but would abide the night, in case aught befell\nthat she should tell her.\n\nBut when the sun was getting low she roused herself and went out, and\nwalked about the meadow, and hearkened to the birds' song, and\nwatched the kine and the goats as they fed down the pasture; and now\na soft content came over her, that all this was free unto her to hold\nin peace, and to take her pleasure in, as much as one lone child of\nAdam might do.\n\nAt last she wandered down to the sandy bight of the lake and stood\ngazing on Green Eyot, where the osiers and willows were grown wild\nand long in all these years, and she said that she would swim over to\nit on the morrow.  But now her feet took her eastward thence toward\nthe haven of the Sending Boat amongst the alders; for in her heart\nshe would fain know if there were any tidings for her.\n\nSo she went softly along the path by the water, where she had sped so\nswiftly that last time, and came at last to the creek-side, and\nlooked down on to the water somewhat timorously.  There then she saw\nwhat she deemed was the very boat itself lying as she had known it;\nbut when she looked again she saw that it lay from stem to stern all\nloose staves with the water betwixt, and the thwarts and ribs all\nsundered and undone, so that never again might it float upon the\nwaves.  Then she said in a soft voice:  Art thou dead then, as thy\nmistress is dead? was it not so that thou wert at the point of death,\nand she also, when thou failedst me at the Isle of Increase Unsought?\nNo voice came to her as she spake; and she said again:  Must I then\nbury thee as I have buried thy mistress?  Nay, that will I not until\nthou compellest me; belike in a short while little of the staves of\nthee shall be left now that the life is out of thee.  Let thy ghost\nand hers foregather if ye will.\n\nAs she spake the last word, she saw a stir about the stern which lay\nfurthest in up the creek, and while she quaked with failing heart,\nlo! a big serpent, mouldy and hairy, grey and brown-flecked, came\nforth from under the stern and went into the water and up the bank\nand so into the dusk of the alder-wood.  Birdalone stood awhile pale\nand heartsick for fear, and when her feet felt life in them, she\nturned and stole away back again into the merry green mead and the\nlow beams of the sun, pondering whether this evil creature were the\nfetch of the wight who drave the ferry under the blood of the sender.\n\nSo she hastened back again to the house, and lit a fire on the\nhearth, and fell to cooking her somewhat of grout to her supper; and\nshe watched the fire, thinking withal:  Now if some poor soul be\nabroad, they may see the smoke and seek hither, and I may comfort\nthem with food and shelter and converse; or when night darkens, they\nmay see the litten windows and come to me; wherefore shall the fire\nburn yet and the candles be lighted, for as warm as is the evening,\neven as if it were Yule-tide and the snow deep without, and the wind\nhowling in the woodland trees.  And therewith she wept for longing of\nthem that she loved.\n\nBut in a little she dried her tears, and reproached herself for her\nmuch softness; and she ate her supper when she had lighted a candle\n(for it was now dark), and again sat looking at the hearth, till she\nsaid:  Now am I getting soft again, and who knows but my softness may\ntempt the ghosts to come in to me.  I will give my hands somewhat to\ndo.\n\nTherewith her eye caught sight of the rents and rags of her old grey\ngown, and she smiled somewhat ruefully as she called to mind her\ngallant knight's array, which lay now on the shore of the evil and\nruined isle; and her goodly attire of the days of the Five Crafts;\nand the rich raiment wherein her friends of the Castle of the Quest\nhad clad her.  Then she arose and sought needle and thread and some\nremnants of green cloth, and did off the ragged coat and fell to\npatching and mending it, and so sat at her work in smock-sewing till\nthe night was old and she was weary and sleep overcame her, and she\nlay down in her bed and slept dreamlessly till the sun was high next\nmorning.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.  THE WOOD-MOTHER COMETH TO BIRDALONE AND HEARETH HER\nSTORY\n\n\n\nNow Birdalone arose and bathed her and broke her fast, and then went\nabout her work with the beasts and the dairy; but all that time\nseemed long to her till she had bow in hand and quiver on back, and\nwas wending her way to the Oak of Tryst; and swift were her feet and\nher heart beat quick with hope of pleasure.\n\nForsooth no long tarrying had she, for scarce had she set her down\nbeneath the oak, ere the wood-mother came forth from the thicket even\nas the first time when Birdalone saw her, and presently she had her\narms about Birdalone and was kissing and clipping her.  Then they sat\ndown together in the shade of the great tree, and the wood-mother\nmade much of her friend with few words and those but simple, while\nBirdalone wept for joy.\n\nAt last spake Birdalone:  Wood-mother, my dear, I look in thy face,\nand I see thee that thou art nowise changed, so that thou callest to\nmy mind the Birdalone that met thee here when she was straying from\nthe House of Captivity like to a bird with a string to its leg.\n\nHabundia smiled on her and said:  So it is that now thou lookest\nolder than I.  Rounder and fuller is thy body, and thy limbs greater\nand fairer, and thy flesh sleeker; lovelier art thou in all wise, and\nsuch as I have thought of thee during these years, save that thy face\nis grown wiser and sadder than might be looked for.  Mother, she\nsaid, I am grown older than I should be by the tale of the years, for\nI have had joy and grief, and grief and joy, and grief again; and now\nthat the years have worn, the grief abideth and the joy hath\ndeparted, save this joy of thee and the day of the meeting I have so\noften thought of.\n\nSaid the wood-wife:  Were I to hear the story of thee, I deem it most\nlike that I would fain buy thy joy with thy grief, both that which\nhas been and that which is to come.  And now I will ask thee right\nout to tell me all thy tale, as much as thou canst; and all thou\ncanst tell to me, who am thine other self:  and I wot moreover that\nthou hast not told of me to any whom thou hast met in the world since\nwe were last together:  is it not so?  In faith and in troth so it\nis, said Birdalone.  Said Habundia, after she had looked hard on\nBirdalone a while:  Now there is this I find in thee, that though\nthou callest me wood-mother still, thou art not my daughter as thou\nwert erewhile, nor I thy mother; and I know not whether to be glad or\nsorry thereof, since thou art even as much my friend as ever thou\nwert.  But much do I rejoice herein that thou hast not told any one\nsoul of me.\n\nSaid Birdalone:  I must tell thee that part of the tale I shall tell\nthee is how I have found my mother in the flesh, and loved her\nsorely; and then I lost her again, for she is dead.\n\nQuoth the wood-wife, smiling on her lovingly:  Then should I be even\nmore thy mother than erst I was:  there will be something else in thy\ntale, sweetling.\n\nThen Birdalone flushed very red, and she smiled piteously in\nHabundia's face; but then she put up her hands to hide the change\ntherein which the anguish of longing wrought, and her shoulders shook\nand her bosom heaved, and she wept bitterly; but the wood-wife still\nlooked on her smiling, and said softly at last:  Yea, how sweet it\nwere to be grieved with thy pain.\n\nBut in a while Birdalone grew calm again and the very smile blossomed\nout in her face, and they kissed together.  Then Habundia rose up and\nlooked on her, and said at last and laughed out withal:  One thing I\nmust needs say, that thou hast not fetched thee raiment of price from\nthe knighthood and the kings' houses; or have I not seen thy grey\ncoat of old time, while thou wert living amidst the witch's cruelty?\nYea forsooth, said Birdalone; thou needest not to ask this.  Verily\nnot, said Habundia, nor why thou art not clad in the fair green gown\nwhich thou didst broider; for whiles I have seen the witch flaunting\nit on the wooden ugly body of her, and thou wouldst not wear it after\nshe had cursed it with her foulness.  Is it not so?  Yea, it is even\nso, said Birdalone; dost thou love me the less therefor?  Habundia\nlaughed again:  Were I a man of Adam's sons, said she, I might make\nthee many words on the seemliness of thy short coat, and the kindness\nof it, that it will be for ever slipping off one or other of thy\nshoulders.  But now am I at least enough thy mother, and thou art\ndwelling even so much in my house, that the next time we meet (and\nthat shall be to-morrow) I shall fetch thee raiment which shall make\nus forget that thou camest back again to this land as naked as thou\ndidst depart thence.\n\nBirdalone reddened and hung down her head, but the wood-mother sat\ndown beside her and kissed her and said:  But now forget all save thy\ntale, and tell all as closely as thou mayest, for I would lose nought\nthereof.  Yea, said Birdalone; and where shall I begin?  Said\nHabundia:  I know nought thereof save the beginning, that thou fledst\naway naked and escaped the witch; and the ending, to wit, that the\nSending Boat failed thee at the last of the Wonder Isles, and that\nthou calledst on me not wholly in vain, whereas the witch was dead,\nand therefore there was nought to stay me from sending thee one of my\ntrees and the wight thereof (whom belike I may show to thee one day)\nto save thee from the bottom of the deep water.\n\nAt that word Birdalone threw herself on the wood-wife and clipped and\nkissed her, and thanked her for the helping with all the dearest\nwords she might.  But the wood-mother laughed for joy, and stroked\nher cheeks and said:  Now I deem thee my daughter again, whereas thou\nthankest me with such sweet passion for doing to thee as a kind\nmother needs must without any thought thereof.  And I bid thee, my\ndear, never again to go so far from me as that I may not easily help\nthee and comfort thee from out of my realm wherein I am mighty.  And\nnow tell me all in thy dear speech.\n\nTherewith Birdalone began her story without more ado, even as ye have\nheard it afore.  Yea and many more things than we can set down did\nshe tell, for full filled she was with the wisdom of the wood.  And\nbetween whiles the wood-mother fed her with dainty meat and drink,\nsuch as Birdalone had never erst tasted the like of.  And by then she\nhad got so far as her flight from the Isle of Increase Unsought, the\nsun was set and the twilight begun.  And the wood-wife said:  Now\nshalt thou go home to thine house; and have no fear of witch or evil\nthing, for I am not far from thee and will watch over thee.  Sweet is\nthy tale, my daughter, and dear are thy she-friends; and if ever it\nmay be that I may do them any pleasure, fain were I; and that\nespecially to thy Viridis, who meseemeth is both sweet and wise even\nas thou thyself art.  Nay, dost thou begrudge my loving her?  Nay,\nnay, said Birdalone, laughing; but I rejoice in it.  And hereafter\nwhen I tell thee how sorely they paid for helping me, I will bid thee\nto love them yet more than now thou dost.  Therewith they parted, and\nBirdalone came to her house; and on the way she made as it were a\nfeigned tale in mockery of her old trouble, that there would be the\nwitch-mistress awaiting her to whip her.  So that when she came to\nthe door she was half frighted with her own mock, lest the witch\nmight now at last have taken to walking.\n\nBut all was quiet when she entered with the last of the twilight, and\nshe rested that night in all peace, as in the best of her days in the\nFive Crafts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.  HABUNDIA HIDETH BIRDALONE'S NAKEDNESS WITH FAERY\nRAIMENT\n\n\n\nNext morning Birdalone tarried about the house as little a while as\nshe might, and then went hastening up to the wood; and when she came\nwithin sight of the Trysting Tree, lo! there was Habundia before her,\nand the hands of her busy turning over goodly raiment, so that it was\nwell-nigh as if the days had gone back to the time of the Captivity,\nand the sitter under the oak was Birdalone herself dealing with her\nhalf-finished gown.\n\nJoyously they met and embraced each other, and then spake the wood-\nwife:  Now, thou darling of the world, I have been no worse than my\nword, and if thou durst wear web of the Faery thou shalt presently be\nclad as goodly as ever thou wert down there amongst the knighthood;\nand then thy tale, my dear, and, if it may be, the wisdom of the\nbarren wood-wife set thereto.\n\nAnd therewith she laid on Birdalone's outstretched arms the raiment\nshe had brought with her, and it was as if the sunbeam had thrust\nthrough the close leafage of the oak, and made its shadow nought a\nspace about Birdalone, so gleamed and glowed in shifty brightness the\nbroidery of the gown; and Birdalone let it fall to earth, and passed\nover her hands and arms the fine smock sewed in yellow and white\nsilk, so that the web thereof seemed of mingled cream and curd; and\nshe looked on the shoon that lay beside the gown, that were done so\nnicely and finely that the work was as the feather-robe of a\nbeauteous bird, whereof one scarce can say whether it be bright or\ngrey, thousand-hued or all simple of colour.  Birdalone quivered for\njoy of the fair things, and crowed in her speech as she knelt before\nHabundia to thank her:  then in a twinkling had she done off her\nbeggar's raiment, and then the smock clung about her darling\nnakedness, and next the gown was shimmering all over her, and the\ngolden girdle embraced her loins as though it loved them worthily;\nand Birdalone looked to the wood round about her and laughed, while\nHabundia lay in her place and smiled upon her with gentle loving-\nkindness.\n\nBut in a little while was Birdalone sobered; for the thought of how\nfair she should look to the eyes of her beloved when she was shown\nunto him on the day of days, thrust her light and eager pleasure\naside; and she took up her shoes from the ground (for she had not\ndone them on), and sat down beside the wood-wife and fell a-toying\nwith the marvel of them; and thus without more ado began her tale\nagain, whereas she had left it last even, when she had told of how\nthe Sending Boat was speeding her over the waters toward the Isle of\nthe Young and the Old.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.  BIRDALONE TELLETH HABUNDIA OF HER LOVE FOR ARTHUR, AND\nGETTETH FROM HER PROMISE OF HELP THEREIN\n\n\n\nLong they sat there that day, and until the sun was down, and by then\nhad Birdalone little to tell of her story, for she was gotten therein\nto the days of the Five Crafts.  Many times had she wept and turned\nto Habundia for solace as she told, not without shame, but without\nany covering up, all the tale of her love for Arthur the Black\nSquire, and how she was surprised by the love of him, and of his\nwisdom and grace and loveliness.  And the wood-mother was ever as\nsweet and kind unto her as could be; yet might another than a lover\nhave seen that much of all this was strange unto her, and she looked\nupon Birdalone as a child who has broken her toy, and is hard to\ncomfort for the loss of it, though there be a many more in the world.\nBut when it grew dusk as aforesaid, and it was time to part, she\nspake to Birdalone, and said:  True it is, my child, that thou hast\nlived long in these six years time; neither do I wonder at the\nincrease of thy beauty, and the majesty thereof; for fair is the life\nthou hast lived, although thou hast been grieved and tormented by it\nat whiles.  And now I know what it is for which thou longest; and\nherein again will I play the mother unto thee, and seek about to\nfetch thee that thou wouldst have; so be not over-anxious or\ntroubled; and thou mayest be good herein, as my fair child should be;\nfor this I have noted in thee, that Love is not so tyrannous a master\nbut that his servants may whiles think of other matters, and so\nsolace their souls, that they may live despite of all.\n\nNow was Birdalone arisen, and stood before her friend confused and\nblushing.  But Habundia put her two hands on her shoulders and kissed\nher, and said:  Go home now and sleep, and come again to-morrow and\nlet us hear the last of thy tale; and when that is done, maybe I\nshall be able to do something for thine avail.\n\nSo they parted, and on the morrow Birdalone came again and told the\nremnant of her story, which was not so long now that the Black Squire\nwas out of it.  And when she had done, Habundia kept silence awhile,\nand then she said:  One thing I will tell thee, that whereas erewhile\nit was but seldom indeed that any son of Adam might be seen in the\nwoodland here, of late, that is, within the last three years, there\nbe many such amongst us; and to our deeming they be evil beasts, more\npitiless and greedy than any bear; and but that we have nought to do\nwith them, for they fear us and flee from us, we should have\ndestroyed them one and all.  And now that I have heard all thy story,\nit seemeth unto me not so unlike but these may be the remnants of the\nbands of the Red Hold, and that they have drifted hither fleeing\nbefore the might of thy friends of the knighthood.  Wherefore now,\ntrust me that I will look into this, but I must needs be away from\nhere for a little; so hold thy soul in patience though hear thou\nnought of me, and dwell quietly at home for seven days' space, and\nthen come hither and find me, farewell now, my child!\n\nSo they kissed and departed; and Birdalone went home to the house,\nand wore the days thereafter doing what was needful about the stead,\nand wandering through the meadows, and swimming the waters about\nGreen Eyot; and the days were not unrestful unto her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.  HOW THE WOOD-WIFE ENTERED THE COT, AND A WONDER THAT\nBEFELL THEREON\n\n\n\nBut when it was the sixth day since those two had met, Birdalone\narose in the morning and stood in the door of the house, and she\nlooked toward the bent which went up to the wood and saw one coming\ndown it, and knew it for Habundia clad in her huntress' raiment and\nbearing something over the left arm, for her bow was in her right\nhand.  So Birdalone ran to meet her, and embraced and kissed her, and\nwas merry over her, and said:  Dear mother, thou farest far from thy\nfastness to-day.  Said Habundia:  There is nought in the meadows now\nsave the neat and the goats and thou; of none of that folk am I\nafraid.  But mayhappen thou shalt be afraid to come with me into the\ndepths of the wildwood, for thither would I lead thee.  I will be\nafraid of nought with thee beside me, said Birdalone.  But come now\nand look upon the house that I have won for me.  And she took her\nhand and led her along; and the wood-wife said no more till they were\nacross the brook and standing by the porch.\n\nThen said Birdalone:  Thou hast a green gown over thine arm; is that\nalso for me?  Yea, certes, said Habundia; the old rag which thou hast\non thee, and which thou lovest so sore, is not fine enough for my\ncompany; and the glitter-gown I gave thee may be too fine for the\nthorns and the briars, and moreover thou mayst be over-easily seen if\nthou bear that broidered sunshine mid the boughs.  Wherefore go in\nnow and do on this other coat, though the faery have made it, and\nthen come out to me with thy bow and thy quiver, and I shall find\nthee sandal-shoon and girdle withal.\n\nNay, wood-mother, said Birdalone, hallow my house by entering it, and\neat a morsel with me and drink the wine of the horned folk ere we go\nour ways.\n\nHabundia shook her head and knit her brows somewhat as she looked\nhard on the house; then she said:  I know not, Adam's daughter; I\nhave little to do with houses, and doubt if a house be safe for me.\nAnd this one that the witch builded! and belike she buried some human\nbeing at one of its four corners.  Tell me, fair child, sawest thou\never here at night-tide the shape of a youngling crowned with a\ngarland straying about the house?\n\nNay, never at all, said Birdalone.  Said the wood-wife:  Then maybe\nthou hast hallowed it with the wisdom and love of thee, and I may\nventure; and moreover I note that it is all builded of trees and the\ngrass of the earth; and thou art free to use them by my leave.  But\nif aught befall of my coming under thy roof, heed it not too much,\nbut think, whatsoever my aspect may be, I am thy wood-mother and\nwisdom-mother that loveth thee.  And I bid thee also wish with all\nthy might that my aspect may not change to thee.  Also, if I eat,\nthou wert best not to sign the meat as Adam's sons are wont.  Lead in\nthen; for now am I grown wilful, and will enter whatever betide.\n\nBirdalone marvelled at those words, but she fell to wishing strongly\nthat her friend might not lose her lovely youthful shape either then\nor ever, and she took her hand, which trembled somewhat, and led her\nover the threshold; and when they were under the roof herseemed that\nthe wood-mother dwindled in a wondrous way, though her face was as\nsweet and her limbs as shapely as ever; and she laughed shrilly yet\nsweetly, and spake in a thin clear voice:  Birdalone, my dear, wish\nstrongly, wish strongly! though thou shalt see nothing worse of me\nthan this.  And she was scarce three feet high, but as pretty as a\npicture.\n\nThereat indeed was Birdalone affrighted, but she wished all she\nmight, and stooped down to kiss this little creature; and therewith\nagain the wood-wife seemed to wax again as great and tall as ever she\nwas, and her voice came full and strong again, as she laughed and\nsaid:  Now is it all over for this time, and I see how well thou\nlovest me; and I pray thee love me no less for this wonder thou hast\nseen in me.  But now it were better that I never go under a roof\nagain.  And she took her arms about Birdalone and clipped her\nlovingly; and glad was Birdalone to feel her so strong and solid\nagain.\n\nThen they sat to the board and ate a simple meal of bread and cheese\nand wood-berries, and drank milk withal; and the wood-mother was\nmerry, and the smiles danced over her face as she looked on Birdalone\nwith all loving-kindness, so that Birdalone wondered what was toward;\nbut so light-hearted and happy she grew, that she deemed it might be\nnought save good.\n\nBut when they had eaten, then Birdalone did off her old coat, which\nshe said was meet enough for her daily toil, and did on the fair\ngreen hunting-gown and the sandal-shoon, and girt her with the fair\ngirdle which Habundia had fetched her, and drew up the laps of her\ngown therethrough till her legs were all free of the skirts.  And\nHabundia looked on her, and laughed and said:  Now are these white\nand smooth legs as bad as the gleam-gown for the lying hid; but it\nmay no better be, and thou must draw thy skirts down and stumble, if\nneeds must be, when we come to the ambushment.\n\nBirdalone reddened as she laughed at the word, and took down her bow\nand hung her quiver at her back and thrust her sharp knife into her\ngirdle, and forth they went both of them, and were presently past the\nbent which went up from the meadows and in amongst Habundia's trees.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.  BIRDALONE WENDETH THE WILDWOOD IN FELLOWSHIP WITH\nHABUNDIA\n\n\n\nNow as they went their ways lightly through the wood, spake Habundia\nand said:  Birdalone, my child, fair is the gold ring with the\nsapphire stone that the third finger of thy right hand beareth;\nseldom have I seen so fair a stone as that deep blue one; hangeth any\ntale thereby?  Said Birdalone:  Did I not tell thee thereof, wood-\nmother, how that my beloved who is lost gave it unto me the very last\ntime I saw him, woe worth the while?  Nay, said Habundia, I mind not\nthe tale.  But deemest thou he would know it again if he saw it?\nYea, surely, said Birdalone, hanging her head; for when first he gave\nit, the gift was not to me, but to another woman.  And she held her\npeace, and went on with hanging head and all the glee faded out of\nher a while.\n\nAt last she turned to Habundia, and said:  I have now bethought me to\nask thee whither we be going and on what errand; for at first I was\nso glad at heart, I know not why, and it was so merry to be wending\nthe wood with thee freely, that I had no thought in me as to whither\nand wherefore.  But now wilt thou tell me?\n\nSaid the wood-wife:  How if I were to tell thee we were going a-\nhunting?  Birdalone said:  Then I should ask thee what like the\nquarry were.  And suppose it were men? said the wood-wife.  Birdalone\nturned somewhat pale.  My mother, she said, if we be going against\nsome of those men of the Red Bands, I am not happy over it.  I am no\nwarrior, and fear strokes.  Said Habundia, laughing:  Yet art thou a\nfell archer; and thou mayest shoot from an ambush of the thick\nleaves, since June is in to-day.  But neither would I slay or hurt\nany man, said Birdalone, but it were to save me from present death.\n\nHabundia looked on her with a sly smile and said:  Well maybe though\nwe take cover and get within wind of our quarry thou shalt not need\nto speed an arrow to him.  Have patience therefore.  For this is a\nstrange beast which I have marked down; he is not ill to look on, and\nhis voice, which we may well hearken, for whiles he singeth, is\nrather sweet than surly.  What meanest thou, mother? said Birdalone,\ngrowing red and then paler yet; what man is it? since thy calling him\na beast is a jest, is it not?\n\nNay, said Habundia, I neither name him nor know him; only I deem him\nby no means to be one of the Red Band.  For the rest, he may be a man\nin a beast's skin, or a beast in a man's skin, for aught I know;\nwhereas he seems, so far as I have seen him, to be not wholly man-\nlike or wholly beast-like.  But now let us hold our peace of him till\nwe be come nigher to his haunt.\n\nSo they went on their way, and Birdalone said but little, while the\nwood-wife was of many words and gay.  They made all diligence, for\nBirdalone was not soon wearied, and moreover as now she was anxious\nand eager to see what would befall, which she might not but deem\nwould be something great.\n\nThey went without stay till past noon, when they were come to a\nlittle shady dale wherethrough ran a clear stream; there they rested\nand bathed them, and thereafter sat under the boughs and ate the\ndainty meat which the wood-wife provided, howsoever she came by it;\nand when they had rested a while, the wood-wife turned the talk once\nmore unto Arthur the Black Squire, and would have Birdalone tell her\nall nicely what manner of man he was; and Birdalone was nothing loth\nthereto; for had she her will she had talked of him day-long.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.  THE WOOD-WIFE BRINGETH BIRDALONE TO THE SIGHT OF\nARTHUR IN THE WILDWOOD\n\n\n\nNow they go on again, no less speedily than before, and rest but\nlittle, until it was hard on an hour before sunset.  And now Habundia\nbegan to go warily, as if they were come anigh to their journey's end\nand the thing that they sought.  They were come by now to a long bent\nof the forest well grown with big-boled oak-trees, not very close\ntogether, so that short fine greensward was all underneath them; and\nHabundia went heedfully from bole to bole, as if she would be ready\nto cover herself if need were; and Birdalone went after her, and was\nnow flushed of face, and her eyes glittered, and her heart beat fast,\nand her legs trembled under her, as she went running from tree to\ntree.\n\nSo came they nigh to the crown of the bent, and before them were the\noak-trees sparser and smaller as they went down the further side,\nwhich seemed by their sudden shortening to be steeper than the hither\nside; and betwixt them showed the topmost of thorn and whitebeam and\nlogwood, intertwined with eglantine and honeysuckle and the new\nshoots of the traveller's joy.  There the wood-wife put forth her\nhand to bid Birdalone stay, who came up to her friend and stood\nbefore her eager and quivering:  and anon came the sound of a man's\nvoice singing, though they could hear no words in it as yet amidst\nthe rustle of the trees and the tumult of song which the blackbirds\nand throstles raised in the dale below them.\n\nThen spake the wood-wife softly:  Hearken, we are right and the time\nis good, our beast is giving tongue:  now below us is the bent-side\nsteep, and goeth down into a very little dale with a clear stream\nrunning amidst; and therein is the very lair of the thing that we are\nhunting.  Wherefore now let us slip warily down between the bushes\ntill we get close to the bottom, and then belike we shall see the\nvery creature quite close, and we shall then consider and think what\nwe shall do with him.\n\nBirdalone had no voice wherewith to answer her, but she stole quietly\nalong by her side till they came to the bank of the dale and plunged\ninto the thicket that flourished there, and fell to threading it,\nmaking them as small as might be.  But ere they had gone but a little\nway the wordless song of what was below had ceased, and they heard\nthe sweet tingle of the string-play, and the wood-wife stayed her to\nhearken, and the smiles went rippling over her face and she beat time\nwith her fingers; but Birdalone, she stared wildly before her, and\nwould have scrambled down the bank straightway at all hazards, for\nthat string-play was a melody of the Castle of the Quest, but\nHabundia withheld her by the arm.  And then suddenly the music died,\nand there came up a voice of wailing and lamenting, and Birdalone put\nher hands and held the palms tight against her ears, and was at point\nto cry out aloud herself; but Habundia drew a hand of her down and\nwhispered into her ear:  Child, child, make thyself strong and\nforbear, and then perchance joy may come to thee; hold thy peace and\ncome softly along with me!\n\nSo Birdalone forbore, and strove with her passion, though the sobs\nrent her bosom for a while; and by then the loud lamenting waned and\nwas done, and the sound of sobbing came up from below, as it had been\nan echo of Birdalone's grief.\n\nThen Habundia drew her on again till they saw the level of the dale\nand its stream piecemeal betwixt the leaves, and they had a glimpse\nof a man on the hither side of the stream; and again they went lower,\ntill they were well-nigh on a level with the greensward of the dale;\nand as Birdalone knelt with head bent low, and her hands covering her\neyes, the wood-wife put away from before her the thick leaves of a\nhazel-bush, and whispering said:  Child, child! look forth now and\nsee what is before thee, and see if thou knowest him, or if he be\nstrange to thee, and thy mother hath done nought for thee when all is\nsaid.\n\nBirdalone looked up, pale and wild-eyed, and into the dale, and saw a\nman sitting on the grass by the stream-side with his head bowed down\non to his knees and his face covered with his hands; he was clad but\nin two or three deerskins hung about him, with a strip of skin for a\ngirdle, wherein was thrust a short sword; his brown hair hung down\nlong and shaggy over his face.  Close by his side lay a little harp,\nand further off a short spear roughly hefted with an ash-staff.  He\nwas beating the earth with his feet and writhing him about over them.\nAnd Birdalone looked, and her breath well-nigh failed her.  For\npresently he sat more quietly, and lifted up his head, and she saw\nhis face that it was Arthur, her beloved; and now she durst not move\nlest he should spring up and flee away; and the mingled pain and\nlonging within her was sweet indeed, but well-nigh deadly.\n\nNow his hand sought round to his harp, and he took it in his arms and\nfondled it as it were, and his fingers went among the strings, and\nanon the voice of it came forth, and it was nought changed from the\nlast time it spake, and Birdalone hearkened breathlessly, till the\nmelody died again and Arthur looked about him and raised his face as\na dog when it fares to howl.\n\nThen Birdalone gave a great cry, and leapt forth out of the thicket\nand stood on the greensward with nought betwixt them two, and she\nstretched out her arms to her beloved and cried out:  O! no, no, no!\ndo it not, I beseech thee, lest I deem that thou art all changed, and\nthat the man and the dear heart beloved of thee has gone out of thee\nand left thee but a beast in a man's shape!\n\nHe leapt up as she spake, and thrust forward his head and looked\nfierce at her, and cried out:  What! art thou come again?  This is\nthe second time I have seen thee, thou image of her that hath\ntormented me so long; of her that left me in my most need and hid\nherself away from me.  Hah! a man, sayest thou?  Did I not strive\nwith it, and hold my manhood so long as I might; and at last it might\nno longer be, and I became a beast and a man-slayer?  But what avails\nit to talk with thee, since thou art but the image of her that hath\nwasted my life.  Yet perchance of the image I may make an end since I\nmay not lay hand on the very destroyer herself; and, woe's me, how I\nloved her! yea, and do still; but not thee, O false image!\n\nAnd forthwith he drew the blade from his girdle and sprang forward at\nBirdalone; and she cowered and cringed, but moved not else.  But\ntherewithal the wood-wife came leaping through the bushes, and she\nnocked an arrow on her bended bow, and threatened him therewith, and\ncried out:  Thou man-beast, I will slay thee if thou hurt my child\nand my dear; so forbear!  Nay, I tell thee more, unless thou make her\nas glad at the sight of thee as I meant her to be, I will in the long\nrun slay thee; so look to it.\n\nHe laughed and said:  What! there is another image of the love that\nwasted me, is there!  Nay, but by the Hallows, this new-comer is the\nfirst one, and the one who chattered at me is the second.  Or is it\nthis, that all women now have the semblance of the evil one that has\nundone me, and there is nought else left?\n\nAnd he stood staring at Birdalone and moved not a while; and she\nstood with her hands before her face cringing before him.  Then he\nraised his arm and cast the weapon far into the bushes of the bank-\nside, and then came forward and stood before Birdalone, and drew down\nher hands from her face and stared in the eyes of her, holding her by\nthe two arms; and he said:  Thou hast forgotten now, belike, how fair\na life we two might have lived if thou hadst not fled from me and\nspoiled me.\n\nAnd thou! by the looks of thee, for thou art sleek and fair, though\nthis moment thou art pale for fear of me, thou hast lived a happy\nlife through all these years, with many a merry thing to think of:\nand dost thou deem that my life was happy, or that I thought of any\nmerry thing, or of anything save my sorrow?  Dost thou doubt it? go\nask the good spears of Greenford, or the Riders of the Red Hold, and\nthe field of the slaughter!  If there was little joy there, less was\nthere elsewhere.\n\nHe left go of her therewith and stood trembling before her, and she\nbowed down and put palm to palm and held them out to him as one who\nprays; and she knew not what she did.\n\nThen he cried out with a lamentable cry and said:  O woe's me! for I\nhave frighted her and scared the wit out of her, so that she knows\nnot who I am nor what I would; and I would pray to her and beseech\nher to pity me, and not depart from me again or mock me with images\nof herself.\n\nThen he went down on his knees to her, and he also joined his hands\nto pray to her; but it seemed as if she was stricken to stone, so\nwholly she moved not.  But for him, he sank his forehead to earth,\nand then he rolled over and his limbs stretched out, and his head\nturned aside and blood gushed out from his mouth.  But Birdalone\nshrieked out and cast herself on his body, and cried:  I have found\nhim, and he is dead! he is dead, and I have slain him, because I was\na timorous fool and feared him; and he was coming to his right mind\nand knew me for what I was!\n\nBut Habundia came and stood over them, and drew up Birdalone, and\nsaid:  Nay, nay, be comforted! for now he is thus, and the strength\nis gone out of him for a while, we may deal with him.  Abide, and I\nwill fetch the blood-staunching herb and the sleepy herb, and then we\nwill heal him, and he will come to his right mind and be a man again.\n\nTherewith she hastened away and was gone but a little; and meanwhile\nBirdalone knelt down by her love and wiped the blood from him, and\ncaressed his sword-hardened hands and moaned over him.  But when the\nwood-wife came back she put Birdalone aside once more, and knelt down\nby the squire and raised his head, and laid the blood-stauncher to\nhis mouth and his heart, and muttered words over him, while Birdalone\nlooked over her shoulder with her pale face; then the she-leech\nfetched water from the stream in a cup which she drew from her\nwallet, and she washed his face, and he came somewhat to himself, so\nthat she might give him drink of the water; and yet more he came to\nhimself.  So then she took the sleepy herb and bruised it in her\nhands and put in his mouth and again said words over him, and\npresently his head fell back and his eyes closed and he slept\npeacefully.\n\nShe stood up then and turned to Birdalone and said:  Now, my child,\nhave we done all that we may do, save that we shall bring him to a\nplace where the dew and the sun shall not torment him and sicken him;\nfor he shall lie thus till the sun comes up to-morrow, or longer; and\nfear nor, for when he awaketh he shall be in his right mind, and\nshall know thee and love thee.  This I swear to thee by the earth and\nthe sun and the woodland.\n\nSaid Birdalone, trembling yet:  O mother, but may I kiss him and\ncaress him?  Yea, surely, said the wood-mother, smiling in her face,\nbut be not too long over it, for lo! the last of the sun, and it were\nbetter that he be under cover ere the twilight falls.\n\nBirdalone knelt down by her love quietly at that word, and fell to\nkissing him softly, and laid her cheek to his, and called him gentle\nnames such as none can tell again without shame, till the wood-wife\nlaid her hand on her shoulder and said kindly and sweetly:  Rise up\nnow, for thou must make it enough for this present; thou shalt have\ntime enough hereafter for more and much more.\n\nSo Birdalone arose and said:  How shall we bear him to his place?\nShall I not take him by the shoulders and thou by the legs?  For I am\nstronger than thou after all these years.\n\nLaughed the wood-wife:  Nay, little one, said she; thou knowest me\nnot utterly as yet.  Thou shalt not bear him at all, nor any part of\nhim; I am strong enough for more than that; see thou!  And she\nstooped down and took him up in her arms as if he were a little\nchild, and stepped off lightly with him; but looked back over her\nshoulder and said to Birdalone:  But thou mayest walk by me and hold\na hand of him as we go, though it will hinder me somewhat; but I know\nthine heart and would pleasure thee, my child.\n\nBirdalone ran up to her and thanked her and kissed her, and took\nArthur's left hand, while Habundia bore him on down the dale and out\nof it, and still along the stream till they came to a place where it\nwas narrow on either side thereof, and a sheer rock came down so near\nto the water that there was but a strip of greensward three yards\nwide betwixt water and rock; and in the face of the rock was a cave\nwide enough for a man to enter by stooping somewhat.  Therein the\nwood-wife lightly bore Arthur, and Birdalone followed; and they found\nthe cave dry and roomy within; there was a bed therein of dry heather\nand bracken, and thereon Habundia laid her burden, and said:  Now, my\nchild, there is nought to do but abide till he comes to himself\nagain, which may be some time to-morrow; and be of good cheer, for he\nwill come to his right self, but he will be weak and humble; but I\nshall have meat and drink ready for him.  Now if thou wilt be ruled\nby me, thou wilt keep out of the way when he awakens; moreover, be\nthou not scared if I meet his awakening with another shape than that\nwhich thou hast known of me; for sure it is that it will trouble his\nwits over-much if again he seeth the two of us alike.  But fear not;\nfor thy sake, my child, I will take no ugly shape, though it may well\nbe less beauteous than thine.\n\nI will do what thou wilt, mother, said Birdalone, for I see that thou\nart helping me all thou mayest; yet I beseech thee let me sit by him\ntill the time of his awakening draweth nigh.\n\nThe wood-wife smiled and nodded yeasay on her, and they sat down,\nboth of them, beside the sleeping man, and the day died into the\nnight as they sat hearkening to the ripple of the brook and the song\nof the nightingales.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.  THE WOOD-MOTHER CHANGETH HER FORM TO THAT OF A WOMAN\nSTRICKEN IN YEARS\n\n\n\nWhen the morrow came, there yet lay Arthur sleeping peacefully, and\nBirdalone awoke from the slumber which had at last fallen on her, and\nlooked about her and saw not Habundia in the cave; so she arose and\nbent over Arthur and kissed him, and so went forth and stood in the\ndoor and looked about her.  And she was still dim-eyed with her just\ndeparted slumber and the brightness of the morning sunlight, and she\nscarce knew whether it were a part of a dream, or a sight that was\nverily before her, that she seemed to see one coming across the brook\ntoward her, stepping heedfully from stone to stone thereof:  a woman\nstricken in years, but slim and trim and upright, clad in a gown of\ngreen cloth, with a tippet of some white fur.  When she was come on\nto the greensward she spake to Birdalone in a sweet voice, but thin\nwith eld, and gave her the sele of the day; and Birdalone was\nsomewhat afraid to see a newcomer, but she greeted her, drawing back\na little from her shyly.  But the old woman said:  What maketh thee\nhere, my daughter?  Dost thou not know that this is my land and my\nhouse, and that I am said not to be unmighty in these woods?\n\nI pray thee pardon me if I have done amiss, said Birdalone; but here\nhave I a sick friend, a young man, and I would pray thee suffer him\nto abide here in this cave a little longer; for there hath been also\nanother friend, a woman, but she hath gone out while I slept, belike\nto gather simples, for she is wise in leechcraft, and is tending the\nsick man.  I pray thee humbly to suffer us lest we lose our friend.\n\nAs she spake, she heard the carline chuckle softly, and at last she\nsaid:  Why, Birdalone, my dear, dost thou not know me after all these\nyears?  Look on me again, look! and thou shalt see that I am not so\nmuch changed from what thou sawest me last night.  I am still thine\nimage, my dear, only I was the image of what thou wert, and now I the\nimage of what thou shalt be when two score years and ten of happy\nlife have worn for thee.  Tell me, am I now aught like to thy mother\nin the flesh?\n\nHow hast thou frighted me, mother, said Birdalone; I thought that my\nfriend had forsaken me, and that perchance the new-comer was another\nwitch like unto the old one, and that I was never to be at rest and\nhappy.  But as to my mother in the flesh, nay, thou art not now\nwholly like unto her; and sooth to say I shall be fainer when thou\nhast thine own shape of me young back again, for I love thee not so\nmuch as now thou art.\n\nThe wood-wife laughed:  Well, she said, thou shalt not see over-much\nof me in this shape; and that the less because of something I shall\nnow tell thee, to wit, that I have been thinking the matter over, and\nI would have thee leave us twain together alone before the young man\nawaketh.  I would have thee get thee home and abide him there; it\nshall not be long I promise thee; and this also, that he shall come\nhome to thee sound in body and whole in limb.\n\nBirdalone's countenance fell, and she said:  Why this second mind,\nmother? why, I pray thee?  Said Habundia:  I fear for thy love lest\nhe be not strong enough to open his eyes upon thy face; but after he\nhath been a day in the woods, and I have spoken to him diversely and\ncheered him with the hope of meeting thee, he may well be strong\nenough to seek thee for a mile's length, and find thine house first\nand then thee.  So now wilt thou obey me?  Nay, if thou must needs\nweep, I will be gone into the thicket till thou hast done, thou\nwilful!  Birdalone smiled through her tears, and said:  I pray thee\npardon my wilfulness, mother, and I will depart without turning back\ninto the cave.  Nay, said Habundia, there is no need for so much\nhaste as that:  I will in now, and do my leechdoms with the sick man.\nBut do thou go across the stream, thou barefoot, and thou wilt find\non the other side, by the foot of the quicken-tree yonder, honeycombs\nand white bread and a bicker of wild goats' milk.  Bathe thee then if\nthou wilt, and bring those matters over hither; and then shalt thou\ngo in and kiss thy mate's sick face with thy fresh one, and\nthereafter shall we sit here by the ripple of the water and break our\nfast; and lastly, thou shalt go in and kiss again and then take to\nthe road.  But tell me, deemest thou surely that thou canst find it\nagain?  Yea, surely, mother, said Birdalone; I am wood-woman enough\nfor that; and now I will do all thy will.  And therewith she stepped\nout lightly on to the greensward and sought up the stream till she\nfound a smooth-grounded pool meet for her bath, and when that was\ndone, she fetched the victual and came back to the wood-wife; then\nthey two sat down together, and ate and drank while the water rippled\nat their feet.  But when they were done, Birdalone gat her into the\ncave again, and kissed the sleeping man fondly, and came forth\nlightly and stood a moment before the wood-wife, and said:  Tell me\nthis at least, mother, when shall he be there?  To-morrow quoth the\nwood-wife; and, for my part, I would keep thee within doors and abide\nhim there, lest there be trouble; for he may not yet be as strong as\nthe strongest.  Birdalone hung down her head and answered not, but\nsaid presently:  Farewell, wood-mother, and be thou blessed.  Then\nshe took up her bow and betook her lightly to the woodland way, and\nthe wood-wife stood looking at her till the thicket had hidden her,\nand then turned back and went into the cave.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.  THE WOOD-WIFE HEALETH AND TENDETH THE BLACK SQUIRE\n\n\n\nShe stood over Arthur for a minute or two, and then stooped down and\nwhispered a word in his ear, and presently he stirred on the bed and\nhalf opened his eyes, but straightway turned on his side, as if to\ngather sleep to him, but she took him by the shoulder and said in a\nclear voice:  Nay, knight, nay; hast thou not slept enough? is there\nnought for thee to do?  He sat up in the bed and rubbed his eyes, and\nhis face was come to its wholesome colour, and his eyes looked out\nquietly and calmly as he looked about the cave and saw the wood-wife\nstanding by him; and he spake in a voice which was somewhat weak, but\nwherein was no passion of rage or woodness:  Where am I then? and who\nart thou, dame?  She said:  Thou art in a cave of the woodland, and I\nam for one thing thy leech, and meseemeth thou desirest to eat and to\ndrink.  He smiled and nodded his head; and she fetched him the milk,\nand he drank a long draught, and sighed thereafter, as one who is\npleased; and she smiled on him, and fetched him the bread and the\nhoney, and he ate and drank again, and then lay down and fell fast\nasleep.  And she suffered his slumber for two hours or so, and then\nawoke him again; and again he asked where he was and what was she,\nbut she said as before.  And said she:  The next thing thou hast to\ndo is to arise, as thou well mayest, and take this raiment, which is\nfair and clean, and go wash thee in the brook and come back to me;\nand then we will talk, and thou shalt tell me of how it was with\nthee, and peradventure I may tell thee somewhat of how it shall be\nwith thee.  As she spoke she went to a coffer which stood in a nook\nof the cave, and drew forth from it a shirt and hosen and shoon, and\na surcoat and hood of fine black cloth, and a gilded girdle and a\nfair sword, red-sheathed, and said:  These may serve thy turn for the\npresent, so take them and don them, and thou shalt look like a squire\nat least, if not a knight.\n\nSo he arose as one in a dream and went out; but as he passed by her\nshe saw something gleaming on his breast, and noted that it was\nBirdalone's fair sapphire ring which hung about his neck; so she\nsmiled, and said under her breath:  Crafty is my dear daughter!  But\nthat shall save me some words at least.  And she abided his return.\n\nAnon he cometh back clad in the fair raiment, with the sword by his\nside; and the wood-wife smote her palms together and cried out:  Now\nindeed thou art fair and well-liking, and a fair lady might well take\npleasure in beholding thee.\n\nBut his brow was knit, and he looked sullen and angry, and he said:\nWhat is all this play? and where gattest thou this ring which I found\ne'en now about my neck?  And who art thou, and why have I been\nbrought hither?\n\nHis eyes looked fiercely on her as he spake, holding out his palm\nwith the ring lying thereon.  But the wood-wife answered:  Many\nquestions, fair youth! but I will tell thee:  the play is for thine\nhealing and pleasure, whereas both sick hast thou been and sorry.  As\nto the ring, it is thou hast got it and not I.  But I will tell thee\nthis, that I have seen it on the finger of a fair damsel who haunteth\nthe woodland not far hence.  As to what I am, that were a long tale\nto tell if I told it all; but believe this meanwhile, that I am the\nlady and mistress of hereabouts, and am not without power over my\nfolk and my land.  And as to why thou wert brought hither, I brought\nthee because I had no better house handy for a sick man to lie in.\n\nThen Arthur stood a long while considering the ring that lay on his\npalm, and at last he put his hand on the wood-wife's shoulder, and\nlooked into her face beseechingly, and said:  O mother, if thou be\nmighty be merciful withal, and have pity on me!  Thou callest me a\nyouth, and so I may be in regard to thee; but I tell thee it is five\nlong years and there hath been no other thought in my heart but what\nwas loathsome to me, and it hath worn and wasted my youth, so that it\nwaneth and withereth and is nought.  O, if thou be mighty, bring me\nto her that I may see her at least one time before I die.  And\ntherewith he fell down on his knees before her, and kissed the hem of\nher gown, and wept.  But she drew him up and looked on him with the\nmerry countenance of a kind old woman, and said:  Nay, nay, I am not\nso hard to be won to thy helping that thou needest pray so sore and\nweep:  here need we tarry no longer, and if thou wilt come with me we\nshall go seek the damsel who bore this ring, though how it should\ncome to thee why should I know?  Neither do I know if the said ring-\nbearer be the one woman whom thou needest.  But I will tell thee at\nonce that she is a dear friend of mine.\n\nThen Arthur threw his arms about her, and kissed her cheeks and\nblessed her, while she laughed on him and said:  Nay, fair sir, if\nthou wilt do so much with the withered branch, what wilt thou with\nthe blossom of the tree?  And he was abashed before her, but hope\nmade his heart to dance.\n\nSo the wood-wife took up her bow, slung her quiver at her back, and\ngirt her short sword to her, and then led him forth, and so into the\nthicket out of the dale and forth into the oaken bent, and lightly\nshe led him thereafter through the woodland.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.  THE BLACK SQUIRE TELLETH THE WOOD-WIFE OF HIS DOINGS\nSINCE BIRDALONE WENT FROM THE CASTLE OF THE QUEST\n\n\n\nAs they went Habundia said to Arthur:  Now shalt thou talk and tell\nfor the shortening of the way, and let us know somewhat of thy story.\nBut first I must tell thee, for thou mayest not know it, so witless\nas then thou wast, that yesterday we found thee down in the dale\nyonder, playing the string-play sweetly indeed, but otherwise dight\nlike a half beast more than a man, so that we wondered at thee and\npitied thee.\n\nArthur knit his brows as if he strove with some memory and might not\nmaster it; then he said:  Thou sayest We, who then was the other?\nSaid Habundia:  I had a dear friend with me.  Quoth he:  And did she\npity me also?  Yea, said the wood-wife, else scarce had she been a\nfriend to me.  O let us on swiftly, said Arthur, so long as the time\nmay be!  And they quickened their pace and ate up the way speedily.\n\nPresently spake the wood-wife again:  Now for the tale of thee, fair\nsir; yet will I shorten it somewhat by telling thee that I know thy\nname, that thou art Arthur the Black Squire of the Castle of the\nQuest.  He stared at that word, and said:  How knewest thou this? how\ncouldst thou guess it, who hast never seen me erst?  A friend told\nme, said she; too long it were as now to tell thee thereof.  Rather\ndo thou tell me how thou didst fare when ye found thy friend gone\nfrom the castle that time ye came home from the winning of the Red\nHold.\n\nArthur stared astonished, and said:  What is it?  Dost thou verily\nknow my love? or art thou a sorceress and knowest somewhat of me by\nspell-work?  I am somewhat more than a sorceress, may-happen, said\nthe wood-wife; but heed it not, since I am thy friend to-day, but\ntell me what I ask, that I may have all the tale of thee; it will\nserve for the shortening of the way.  Said Arthur:  And who but I\nneedeth it as short as may be? so stand we not loitering here, and I\nwill talk as we wend on speedily.\n\nOn they sped therefore, and said Arthur:  How did I fare? as one\nstunned, mother, and knew not what had happened; and when I heard\ntheir babble of how she had done wrong here and right there, I was\ndriven half mad by it, so that I hastened back to the Red Hold, and\nbecame the captain of Greenford, to hunt down their scattered foemen;\nfor I said to myself that needs must I rage and slay, and that were\nworser amongst my friends than mine unfriends.  What then? that\nbusiness came to an end; though all the ill men were not slain, but\nall were driven away from the parts of Greenford; and sooth to say\nthey durst not come anywhere nigh where they heard of me.  Then\nbecame each day like every other, and the thought of my hope and my\ndespair ate mine heart out, and I was of no avail unto any.  Now it\nso happened, amidst my many battles and chases, I had hunted the\nbands of the Red Hold into the northwest marches of the woodland; and\nI noted that even they, howsoever hard bestead, and the worst of men\nto boot, would scarce at the first be driven into the thickets\nthereof, though at last, whether or no they have made covenant with\nthe devils, there I know not, they have betaken them to the depths of\nthe wood and have borne off women from the dwellings and got children\non them, and are like to breed an evil folk.  That then I noted that\nthis Evilshaw was a dwelling loathed and desert, and little like it\nwas that any would meddle with me there.  Three years had worn since\nI was cast away at the Castle of the Quest by her that loved me, who\nmust needs sacrifice both her and me to the busy devil of folly; and\nI also deemed that if I sought for her I should not find her; and yet\nmore forsooth, that if I found her she would be as hard unto me as\nwhen she fled from me.  And as for me, I was gotten hard and crabbed,\nand no man, if his heart would let him, would have aught to say to\nme.  So I gat me away from the Red Hold, as I had from the Castle of\nthe Quest, and I gave out that I would enter into religion, and\nforbade any man to follow me.  Neither did any desire it.  First of\nall I set me down at the very outskirts of the woodland, and raised\nme a bower there, rude and ill-shapen.  Few folk came anigh me, and\nyet some few, charcoal-burners, and hunters of the edges of the wood,\nand suchlike.  These deemed me a holy man, whereas I was but surly.\nSomewhat also they feared me, whereas in some of their huntings or\ngoings and comings after prey I had put forth all my strength, eked\nout by the lore of knighthood, which was strange to them.  One man\nthere was of them who was fashioned of the minstrel craft by nature,\nand who forgathered with me specially, till we became friends, and he\nwas a solace to me, with his tales and his songs of a rougher people\nthan I had been wont to deal with.  But when I had been in that place\nfor two years he died of a sickness, and I was left lonely, and my\nsoreness of heart fell upon me till I scarce knew what next I should\ndo.  So I fared away yet deeper into the wildwood, taking with me the\nharp which my friend had given me before he died.  It was summer, and\nI wandered about ever deeper into the wood, until belike I had scarce\nbeen able to win out of it if I had tried.  At last, when the autumn\ncame, I built myself again some sort of a bower in a clearing of the\nwood wherein was water, and the resort of plenteous venison.\n\nWhat befell next?  My mind is not over-clear concerning it all, for I\nwas now becoming more of a beast than a man.  But this I know, that\nsome men of the bands whom I had chased happened on me.  They knew me\nnot for their old foeman, but of their kind it was to torment and\nslay any man whom they might lightly overcome.  Yet was not the\nbattle so over-light but that I slew and hurt divers of them ere they\ngot me under and stripped me and bound my hands and tormented me,\nafter the manner that the devils shall do with them when they shall\ngo to their reward.  Yet somehow I lived, though they deemed me dead,\nand I crawled away thence when they were gone; and somehow I was\nhealed of my body, but I was confused of my wit thereafter, and now\ncan call to mind but little of what befell me as I strayed from place\nto place, save that I remember I was hapless and heart-sore ever:\nand also meseemeth that I saw visions at whiles, and those who had\nbeen in my life before these things, their images would come before\nme to mock me as I sat singing whiles and whiles playing the string-\nplay (for my harp I bore ever with me); and whiles I bewailed me, and\ncalled for help on them that would not or might not help me.  And now\nI may not even tell the years of my abiding in the desert, how many\nthey be.  But I pray thee let us on more swiftly yet.\n\nSaid the wood-wife:  Thou hast told me but little of thy life, Black\nSquire, but it is enough maybe; and I see that thou mayst not tell me\nmore because thou hast thy mind set on what may betide thee when this\nday is over.  But thou must know that thou hast come into the wood of\nEvilshaw, wherein, besides those savage men who quelled thee and\ntheir like, there be uncouth things no few, and wights that be not of\nthe race of Adam; wherefore no great marvel is it that thou sawest\nvisions, and images of them that were not by thee.  Yea, said he, but\none vision had I that confused and overcame me more than all others,\nand meseemeth that came to me not long ago.  For first I saw the\nshape of her that my soul desireth ever, and it wept and lamented for\nme; and then for a little I seemed as if I were coming forth from my\nconfusion of wit; when lo! there issued from the thicket another\nimage of my beloved and blamed me and threatened me.  God wot good\ncause there was of the blame.  But tell me, mother, since thou\ncallest thyself wise, what may this portend?\n\nThe wood-wife laughed:  Since I am wise, said she, I will foretell\nthee good days.  And now we will talk no more of thee or thy love or\nthy sorrow, but since thou wilt so fiercely devour the way, I will\ntell thee a tale or two of this wood and its wights to save us from\nover-much weariness.\n\nSo did she, talking and telling as they went; and she went on a pace\nbefore him, and howsoever long or hardly he might stride he might not\novergo her.  And so fast they went, that they were within a little\nway of the Oak of Tryst a good while before the sun had set, though\nthey had set out from the cave three hours after the hour when\nBirdalone and the wood-wife had left the House under the Wood on the\nyesterday.  They had come to a steep rock that rose up from a water's\nside, and the wood-wife bade stay, whether Arthur would or no, and\nshe made him eat and drink, bringing the victual and wine from out of\na cleft in the said rock.  And she held him there till the night was\ncome and there was a glimmer of the rising moon in the east, and he\nwas ill at ease and restless; but still she held him there till the\nmoon rose high and shone upon them, and the shadows of the oak-boughs\nlay black all around.\n\nThen she bade him arise, and let him on to the Oak of Tryst, yea and\nsomewhat beyond it toward the great water.  Then she spake to him:\nBlack Squire, I am now come home, and will lead thee no further; I\nwas deeming that we should have slept in the wood a good way from\nthis, and then would I have brought thee on thy way to-morrow\nmorning; but the eagerness of thine heart hath made thy feet so\nspeedy, that we be here somewhat rathe, and yet I am not ill-pleased\ntherewith.  Then she turned him about and said:  Look down the bent\nand tell me what thou seest.  He said:  I see the boles of goodly\ntrees, and betwixt them the gleaming of a great water.  She said:  Go\nthitherward then while the moon is yet at her brightest, and thou\nshalt presently come to wide meads lying along the water, and a\nstream running through them.  Enter then into the meads and look\nabout thee, and thou shalt see a little house (there is none other\nnigh) standing just across the said stream; go up thither boldly and\ncrave guesting from whomsoever thou shalt find there, and maybe\nthings shall go after thy mind.  More than this I may not do for\nthee.  Farewell then, and if thou wilt thou mayst meet me again; that\nis to say, that which is verily me:  but it is like that this shape\nwhich hath been striding on with thee daylong thou shalt not see any\nmore.\n\nHe looked on her wondering, for she seemed to grow goodly and stately\nbefore his eyes.  But even as he stretched forth his hand to take\nhers, she turned about suddenly and fared into the wood out of his\nsight, wending full as swiftly as might have been looked for.  Then\nhe drew his sword and turned his face from the wood, and went down\ntoward the water.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.  SIR ARTHUR COMETH TO THE HOUSE UNDER THE WOOD\n\n\n\nSo came Arthur into the meadows, and went eagerly but warily over the\ndewy grass.  And here and there a cow rose before him and went\nbundling down the mead a little way, and the owls cried out from\nbehind him, and a fox barked from the thicket's edge.  Then he found\nhimself on the stream-side, and he stayed and looked from side to\nside, and lo! on the other side of the stream a little house that\nlooked familiar to him as a yeoman's dwelling in the builded lands,\nand the thatch thereon shone under the moon and its windows were\nyellow with candle-light; and so homely it seemed to him, that he\nthrust his sword into the sheath and lightly crossed the brook, and\ncame to the door and laid his hand upon the latch and lifted it and\nshoved the door, and all was open before him.\n\nHis eyes, coming from the night, dazzled with the bright light of the\ncandles, but he saw a fair woman rising up in her place, and he said:\nMay a traveller in the woodland be welcome here to-night, dealing\nwith all in all honour?\n\nBut the woman came toward him holding out her two hands, and ere he\ncould cry out that he knew her, she had thrown herself upon him, and\nhad cast her arms about him and was kissing his face, and murmuring:\nO welcome indeed! welcome, welcome, and welcome!  And so sore did his\npast grief and his desire move him, that he was weak before her, and\nheld down his hands and let her do.  And both those were breathless\nwith wonder and joy and longing; and they stood aloof a little in a\nwhile and looked on each other, she with heaving bosom and streaming\neyes, and he with arms stretched forth and lips that strove with his\nheart's words and might not utter them; but once more she gave\nherself to him, and he took her in his arms strongly now, so that she\nwas frail and weak before him, and he laid his cheek to her cheek and\nhis lips to her lips, and kissed her eyes and her shoulders and\nmurmured over her.  And then again they stood apart, and she took him\nby the hand and led him to the settle, and set him down by her, and\nherself by him; and a while they said nought.  Then she spake as one\nwho had come to herself and was calm, though her heart was aflame for\nlove:  Tell me, love, when thine hand was on the latch didst thou\nlook to find me here in this house? for thine hand it was that waked\nme; I heard not thy foot before the threshold, for I was weary and\nslumbering.  Alas! that I lost the sound of thy feet!  He spake, and\nhis voice sounded false unto him, as if it came from another's mouth:\nI wot not; the woman that led me nearby seemed to bid me hope.  Then\nhe said:  Nay, the sooth is that I should have died if I had not\nfound thee here; I have been sick so long with hoping.\n\nAgain were they silent till she said:  I would that I had heard thee\ncrossing the brook.  But the wood-wife bade me look for thee no\nearlier than to-morrow; else had I time enough; and I would have made\nthe house trim with the new green boughs, and dighted our bed with\nrose blooms; and I would have done on me my shining gown that the\nwood-wife gave me.  For indeed she was but clad in her scanty smock\nand nought else.\n\nBut he laid his head on her bosom and kissed her all about, and said:\nNay, my own love, it is well, it is better.  And she murmured over\nhim:  O friend, my dear, think not that I had will to hide me from\nthee.  All that is here of me is thine, and thine, and thine.\n\nAnd she took his hand and they arose together, and she said:  O\nfriend, I fled from thee once and left thee lonely of me because I\ndeemed need drave me to it; and I feared the strife of friends, and\nconfusion and tangle.  Now if thou wilt avenge thee on me thou\nmayest, for I am in thy power.  Yet will I ask thee what need will\ndrive thee to leave me lonely?\n\nHe said:  The need of death.  But she said:  Mayhappen we shall lie\ntogether then, as here to-night we shall lie.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.  FAIR DAYS IN THE HOUSE OF LOVE\n\n\n\nOn the morrow it was sweet times betwixt those twain, and what was\nhard and fierce of their love they seemed to have put behind them.  A\ndear joy it was to Birdalone that day to busy herself about the\nhousekeeping, and to provide whatsoever seemed now, or had seemed to\nher in her early days, to be dainties of their meadow and woodland\nhusbandry, as cream and junkets and wood-fruit and honey, and fine\nbread made for that very occasion.\n\nWithal she was careful as a mother with a child that he should not\nover-weary himself with the sun of the early summer, but rather to\nfollow the brook up into the wood and lie adown in the flecked shadow\nand rest him wholly, as if there were nought for him to do but to\ntake in rest all that was done for his service, both by the earth and\nby the hands and nimble feet of Birdalone.  And as she was wilful in\nother ways of her cherishing, so also in this, that for nought in\nthat daylight would she go anywise disarrayed, nay not so much as to\ngo barefoot, though he prayed her thereof sorely, and told her that\nfairer and sweeter she was in her smock alone than in any other\nraiment.  For in the morning she went in her woodland green let down\nto her heels, and when the day wore towards evening, and the wind\ncame cool from over the Great Water, then she did on her wonder-\nraiment which the wood-wife had given her, and led Arthur over the\nmeadows here and there, and went gleaming by the side of the black-\nclad man along the water's lip.  And they looked forth on to Green\nEyot and Rock Eyot, and stood by the shallow bight where she had\nbathed those times; and they went along to the dismal creek where the\nSending Boat was wont to lie, and where yet lay the scattered staves\nof it; and then along the meadow-land they went from end to end,\nresting oft on the flowery grass, till the dews began to fall and the\nmoon cast shadows on the greensward.  Then home they fared to the\nhouse; and again on the way must Birdalone feign for their disport\nthat the witch was come back again, and was awaiting her to play the\ntyrant with her; and Arthur fell in with her game, and kissed her and\nclipped her, and then drew his sword and said:  By All-hallows I\nshall smite off her head if she but lay a finger on thee.\n\nSo they played like two happy children till they came to the door of\nthe house, and Birdalone shoved it open, and they two looked in\ntogether and saw nought worse therein save the strange shadows that\nthe moon cast from the settle on to the floor.  Then Birdalone drew\nin her love, and went about lighting the candles and quickening a\nlittle cooking fire on the hearth, till the yellow light chased the\nmoon away from the bed of their desire.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.  THOSE TWAIN WILL SEEK THE WISDOM OF THE WOOD-WIFE\n\n\n\nAgain next day was their life such as it had been the day before; and\nas they lay in cool shadow of a great oak, Birdalone fell to telling\nArthur all the whole story of her dealings with the wood-wife, and\nhow that she had so loved her and holpen her, that through her love\nand her help she had escaped the witch and her snares, who would have\nturned her into a half-devil for the undoing of manfolk.  And how\nthat the said wood-wife had never appeared to her but as an image and\ndouble of herself, save on the time when she played the leech to him.\nThen she told him how all had gone when the wood-wife had sought him\nout for the fulfilment of their love, and of the dreadful day when\nthey had come upon him out of his wit and but little manlike.\n\nThen she asked, would he, within the next day or two, that they\nshould go see the wood-wife together and thank her for her help, and\nbring him within the ring of her love and guarding; and he yeasaid it\nwith a good will.\n\nAfter this she would have him tell her of how things had gone with\nhim since that evil day when he had come home from the Castle of the\nQuest and found her gone.  So he told her somewhat, and of his dole\nand misery, and his dealings with the foemen of Greenford; but yet\nscantly, and as one compelled; and at last he said:\n\nDear love, since thou art cossetting me with all solace of caresses,\nI pray thee remember my trouble and grief, how sore they were, and do\nwith me as with a sick man getting well, as I wot surely thou\nwouldest do; and do thou that which is at this present the softest\nand merriest to me, and that forsooth is, that thou shouldest talk\nand tell, and I should hearken the sweetness of the music, and only\nhere and there put in a word to rest thee and make thy tale the\nsweeter.\n\nShe laughed with love on him, and without more ado fell to telling\neverything she might think of, concerning her days in the House of\nCaptivity, both when she was but a bairn, and when she was grown to\nbe a young woman; and long was she about the tale, nor was it all\ndone in one day; and a multitude of things she told him which are not\nset down in this book.\n\nIn the evening when they were going again to and fro the meads, it\nwas other talk they fell on, to wit, of their fellows of the Quest,\nboth of Sir Hugh and the three lovely ladies:  and now was Arthur\nnought but kind when he spake of Atra, nor spake Birdalone otherwise;\nbut she said:  I shall now say a hard word, yet must thou bear it, my\nloveling, since we twain are now become one, and have but one joy\ntogether and one sorrow.  Deemest thou that Atra is yet alive?  Sooth\nit is, said Arthur, it may well be that I have slain her.  And what\nmay we do by her if ever we fall in with her alive? said Birdalone.\nI wot not, said Arthur; some would say that we have done penance for\nour fault, both thou and I; and what other penance may we do, save\nsundering from each other?  And by God above I will not.  By thine\nhead and thine hands I will not, said Birdalone.\n\nSo said they; but therewith their eyes told tales of the fair eve and\nthe lovely meadows, and the house, the shrine of the dear white bed\nno less sweet to them than erst; but then presently Birdalone stayed\nher love, and took her arms about him, and each felt the sweetness of\nthe other's body, and joy blossomed anew in their hearts.  Then fell\nArthur to telling of the deeds and the kindness of Baudoin, whom\nnever again they should see on the earth; and they turned back home\nto the house, and on the way spake Birdalone:  This is what I would\nwe should do:  whereas I have sought thee and thou me, and we have\nfound each other, whereas ye sought me when I went astray in the\nBlack Valley of the Greywethers, and before, when ye three sought\nyour own loves, now I would that we should seek our fellows and have\njoy in them, and thole sorrow with them as in days gone by.\n\nSpake Arthur:  Dear is the rest with thee in this wilderness; yet\nwere it a deed of fame, and would bring about a day of joy, might we\nfind our friends again, and knit up the links of the fellowship once\nmore.  But thou the wise and valiant! belike thou hast in thine head\nsome device whereby this might be set about.\n\nBirdalone said:  Simple is my device, to wit, that we ask one who is\nwiser than I.  Let us tarry not, but go to-morrow and see the wood-\nwife and talk with her concerning it.  Then she smiled upon him and\nsaid:  But when thou seest her, wilt thou be aghast if she come\nbefore us in my shape of what I was five years agone, or six?\n\nNay, nay, he said, thou art not so terrible as that; not very far do\nI run from thee now.  And therewith they kissed and embraced, and so\nentered the House of Love.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.  THEY HAVE SPEECH WITH HABUNDIA CONCERNING THE GREEN\nKNIGHT AND HIS FELLOWS\n\n\n\nWhen the morrow was they arose and went their ways toward the wood,\nand Birdalone in her hunter's coat, quiver at back and bow in hand.\nThey came to the Oak of Tryst, and Birdalone was at point to call on\nthe wood-wife by the burning of a hair of hers, when she came lightly\nfrom out the thicket, clad as Birdalone, and her very image.  She\nstood before them with a glad countenance, and said:  Welcome to the\nseekers and finders.  But Arthur stepped forth and knelt before her,\nand took her right hand and kissed it, and said:  Here I swear\nallegiance to thee, O Lady of the Woods, to do thy will in all\nthings, and give thee thanks from my heart more than my tongue can\nsay.\n\nQuoth the wood-wife:  I take thine allegiance, fair young man, and\nmine help shalt thou have henceforward.  Then she smiled and her eyes\ndanced for merriment, and she said:  Yet thy thanks meseemeth for\nthis while are more due to the wise carline who brought thee through\nthe woods two days ago, and only left thee when the way was easy and\nclear to thee.\n\nLady, said Arthur, I know now how great is thy might, and that thou\ncanst take more shapes than this only; and humbly I thank thee that\nfor us thou hast taken the shape that I love the best of all on the\nearth.\n\nSaid the wood-wife:  Stand up, Black Squire, and consider a little\nwhat thou wouldst have me do for thee, while I have speech with mine\nimage yonder.  And therewith she came up to Birdalone, and drew her a\nlittle apart, and fell to stroking her cheeks and patting her hands\nand diversely caressing her, and she said to her:  How now, my child,\nhave I done for thee what I promised, and art thou wholly happy now?\nO yea, said Birdalone; if nought else befell us in this life but to\ndwell together betwixt the woodland and the water, and to see thee\noft, full happy should we be.\n\nNevertheless, said Habundia, art thou not come hither to ask somewhat\nof me, that ye may be happier?  So it is, wise mother, said\nBirdalone; grudge not against me therefor, for more than one thing\ndrives me thereto.  I will not grudge, said the wood-wife; but now I\nwill ask thy mate if he has thought what it is that he will have of\nme.  And she turned to Arthur, who came forth and said:  Lady, I have\nheard thee, and herein would we have thee help us:  There were erst\nsix fellows of us, three caries and three queans, to whom was added\nthis sweetling here; but one of them, to wit the Golden Knight, was\nslain, and for the rest . . .  Yea, I know, said the wood-wife; my\nchild here hath told me all; and now ye wot not where they are or if\nthey be yet alive, all or any of them.  Now is it not so that ye\nwould seek these friends, if it were but to greet them but once, and\nthat ye would ask of the wise wood-wife help to find them?  Is there\nany more of the tale?  Nay, lady, said Arthur.\n\nSaid she:  Well then, that help shall ye have, were it but for the\nsake of that little Viridis whereof my child hath told me.  Wherefore\nabide tidings of me for a fourteen days, and seek not to me ere then;\nand meantime fear not, nor doubt me, for many messengers I have, and\never may I do somewhat if the end of the tale is to be told in these\nwoodlands:  and I deem these friends will not be hard to draw hither,\nfor it is most like that they be thinking of you and longing for you,\nas ye for them.  And now I will depart on my business, which is\nyours, and do ye be happy to-day in the woodland, and to-morrow in\nthe meadows and by the water; and let no trouble weigh down your\nhappy days.\n\nTherewith she flitted away from them, when she had kissed them both.\nBut when she was gone they fared away together deep into the wood,\nand were exceeding merry disporting them, and on their return they\ngat them venison for their meat, and so came back to the House of\nLove when the moon was up and shining brightly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.  HABUNDIA COMETH WITH TIDINGS OF THOSE DEAR FRIENDS\n\n\n\nWore the days thenceforth merrily; and one day it was delight in the\nwide meads, and another they went a long way west along the water-\nside, and so into another meadow-plain, smaller than their home-\nplain, which Birdalone had never erst come into; and three eyots lay\noff it, green and tree-beset, whereto they swam out together.  Then\nthey went into the wood thereby in the heat of the afternoon, and so\nwore the day, that they deemed themselves belated, and lay there\nunder a thorn-bush the night through.\n\nAnother day Birdalone took her mate over on to Green Eyot and Rock\nEyot, and showed him all the places she was used to haunt.  And they\nhad their fishing-gear with them, and angled off the eyots a good\npart of the day, and had good catch, and swam back therewith merrily.\nAnd Birdalone laughed, and said that it seemed to her as if once\nagain she were ransoming her skin of the witch-wife by that noble\ncatch.\n\nDivers times also they fared into the wood, and thrice they lay out\nthe night there in some woodlawn where was water; and on one of these\ntimes it happed that Arthur awoke in the grey dawn, and lay open-eyed\nbut not moving for a little; and therewith he deemed he saw the gleam\nof war-gear in the thicket.  So he kept as still as he might, but gat\nhis sword out of its sheath without noise, and then leapt up\nsuddenly, and sprang thitherward whereas he had seen that token, and\nagain saw armour gleam and heard some man crashing through the\nunderwood, for all was gone in one moment.  So he woke up Birdalone,\nand they bended their bows both of them, and searched the thicket\nthereabouts heedfully, arrow on string, but found nought fiercer than\na great sow and her farrow.  So came the full day, and they gat them\nback to their meadows and their house; but thereafter were they\nwarier in going about the woodland.\n\nIn all joyance then wore the days till the fifteenth, and in the\nmorning early they went their ways to the Oak of Tryst, and had no\nneed to call Habundia to them, for presently she came forth out of\nthe thicket, with her gown gathered up into her girdle and bow in\nhand.  But she cast it down and ran up to Birdalone, and kissed her\nand clipped her, and then she took a hand of Arthur and a hand of\nBirdalone, and held them both and said:  My child, and thou dear\nknight, have ye still a longing to fall in with those friends of\nyours, and to run all risk of whatsoever contention and strife there\nmay be betwixt you thereafter?  Yea, certes, said Arthur; and even so\nsaid Birdalone.  Well is that then, said the wood-wife; but now and\nfor this time, ere I help you, I shall put a price upon my help, and\nthis is the price, that ye swear to me never wholly to sunder from\nme; that once in the year at least, as long as ye be alive and\nwayworthy, ye come into the Forest of Evilshaw, and summon me by the\nburning of a hair of mine, that we may meet and be merry for a while,\nand part with the hope of meeting once more at least.  And if ye will\nnot pay the price, go in peace, and ye shall yet have my help in all\nother matters that may seem good unto you, but not in this of joining\nyour fellowship together.  How sayest thou, Birdalone, my child?  How\nsayest thou, Black Squire, whom, as meseemeth, I have delivered from\na fate worse than death, and have brought out of wretchedness into\nbliss?\n\nSpake Birdalone:  Had I dared, I would have bidden thee to swear to\nme even such an oath, to wit, that thou wouldst never wholly sunder\nthee from me.  How then may I not swear this that thou biddest me,\nand that with all joy and trustiness?\n\nSpake Arthur:  Lady, had I no will to swear oath for thy sake, yet\nwith a good will would I swear it for my true-love's sake who loveth\nthee.  Yet verily of mine own will would I swear it joyfully, were it\nfor nought else save to pleasure thee, who hast done so kindly by me,\nand hath given me back my manhood and my love, which else I had\nmiserably lost.\n\nSpake the wood-wife:  It is well again.  Join hands then, and swear\nas I have bidden you by the love ye bear each other.\n\nEven so they did, and then the wood-wife kissed them both and said:\nNow do I deem you earth's very children and mine, and this desire of\nyours is good, and it shall be done if I may bring it about; yet\ntherein the valiance and wisdom of you both may well be tried.  For\nthis have I found out by my messengers and others, that your friends\nare alive, all of them; and they have thought of you in their inmost\nhearts, and have long determined that they must needs go seek you if\nthey are to live lives happy and worthy.  Furthermore, their quest\nhath drawn them hither to Evilshaw (nor say I that I have been\nnothing therein), and they are even now in the wood.  But ye shall\nknow that peril encompasses them; for they fare but a few, and of\nthose few be there two traitors who are minded to deliver them to the\nmen of the Red Company, unto whom three women as fair as your she-\nfriends were a prize indeed.  Wherefore the Red Folk are dogging\nthem, and will fall upon them when they find the occasion.  But I\nshall see to it that the occasion shall be in time and place where\nthey shall not be unholpen.  Now what ye have to do for your parts,\nis to waylay the waylayers, and keep watch and ward anigh the road\nthey must needs take, and to fall on when need is.  But this again I\nshall see to, that your onset fail not.\n\nBut now ye may say:  Since thou art mighty, why shouldst not thou\nthyself take our friends out of the hands of these accursed, as thou\ncouldst well do, and we to take no part therein?  My friends, this\nmight indeed well be; but thou, Birdalone, hast told me the whole\ntale, and how that there be wrongs to be forgiven which cannot be\nmade right, and past kindness to be quickened again, and coldness to\nbe kindled into love, and estrangement into familiar friendship; and\nmeseems that the sight of your bodies and your hands made manifest to\nthe eyes of them may do somewhat herein.  Yet if otherwise ye think,\nthen so let it be, and go ye back to the House under the Wood, and in\nthree days' time I will bring you your friends all safe and sound.\n\nNow they both said that they would not for aught that they should\nhave no hand in the deliverance of them; so the wood-wife said:  Come\nwith me, and I shall lead you to the place of your ambush.\n\nThen all they went on together, and fared a long way west, and toward\nthe place where erst they two had found Arthur; and at last, two\nhours before sunset, they came to where was a glade or way between\nthe thickets, which was as it were a little beaten by the goings of\nman-folk.  And the wood-wife did them to wit, that the evil folk\naforesaid had so used it and beaten it, that it might just look as if\nfolk were wont to pass that way, whereas it was not very far from\ntheir chiefest haunt and stronghold.  A little on the north side of\nthis half-blind way, and some ten yards through the thicket, the\nground fell away into a little dale, the bottom whereof was plain and\nwell grassed, and watered by a brook.\n\nThither the wood-wife brought the twain; and when they all stood\ntogether on the brook-side, she said to them:  Dear friends, this is\nyour woodland house for this time, and I rede you go not forth of it,\nlest ye happen upon any of those evil men; for nought have ye to fear\nfrom any save them.  Here amidst these big stones, which make, see\nye, as it were a cavern, have I stowed victual for you; and armour\ntherewithal, because, though both of you are in a manner armed, yet\nwho knoweth where a shaft drawn at a venture may reach.\n\nAnd from the said stones she drew forth two very fair armours, helm\nand hauberk, and leg and arm wards; and they were all of green, and\nshone but little, but were fashioned as no smith of man-folk could\nhave done the like.\n\nThis is thine, Sir Arthur, said the wood-wife, and thou wilt wear it\nlike as it were silk; and this thine, my child, and thou art strong\nenough to bear such light gear.  And I charge you both to do on this\ngear presently, nor do it off till ye have achieved the adventure.\nAnd now this is the last word:  here is a horn of oliphant which thou\nshalt wear about thy neck, Birdalone; and if thou be sore bestead, or\nthy heart faileth thee, blow in it, yet not before the onfall; and\nthen, whether thou blow much or little, thou shalt be well holpen.\n\nNow be not downcast if nought befall to-night or to-morrow, or even\nthe day after; but if the third day be tidingless, then at sunset\nburn a hair of my head, Birdalone, and I will come to you.  And now\nfarewell! for I have yet to do in this matter.\n\nWith that she kissed Birdalone fondly and embraced Arthur, and went\nher way; and those twain abode in the dale, and slept and watched by\nturns, and all was tidingless till the morrow's dawn; neither was\nthere aught to tell of on that day and the night that ended it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.  OF THE FIGHT IN THE FOREST AND THE RESCUE OF THOSE\nFRIENDS FROM THE MEN OF THE RED COMPANY\n\n\n\nLight was growing on the dawn of the next day, and the colours of\nthings could be seen, when Birdalone, who was holding this last watch\nof the night, stood still and hearkened, deeming that she could hear\nsome noise that was neither the morning wind in the tree-boughs nor\nthe going of the wild things anear them in the wood.\n\nSo she did off her helm to hear the better, and stood thus a little;\nthen she turned about and stooped down to Arthur, who was yet\nsleeping, and put forth a hand to rouse him.  But or ever she touched\nhim, broke forth a sound of big and rough voices and laughter, and\namidst it two shrieks as of women.\n\nArthur heard it, and was on his feet in a moment, and helmed, and he\ncaught up his bended bow and cast on the quiver (for Birdalone was\nalready weaponed), and without more words they went forth swiftly up\nthe bank and through the thicket till they were looking on the half-\nblind way, but under cover, and there was nothing before them as yet.\n\nThere they stayed and hearkened keenly.  There were no more shrieks\nof women, nor heard they any weapon clash, but the talking and\nlaughter of men went on; and at last they heard a huge and grim whoop\nof many men together; and then thereafter was less sound of talking,\nbut came the jingle as of arms and harness; and Arthur whispered in\nBirdalone's ear:  Stand close! they have gotten to horse, and will be\ncoming our way.  Nock an arrow.  And even so did he.\n\nTherewith they heard clearly the riding of men, and in less than five\nminutes' space they saw three big weaponed men riding together, clad\nin red surcoats, and they were so nigh that they heard the words of\ntheir speech.  One said to the other:  How long shall the knight hold\nout, think ye?  Oh, a week maybe, said the other.  Meseems it was\nscathe that we stayed not a while to pine him, said the first man.\nNay, said the second, we be over-heavy laden with bed-gear to tarry.\nAnd they all laughed thereat, and so went on out of hearing.\n\nBut then came four on together, whereof one, a gaunt, oldish man, was\nsaying:  It is not so much how long we shall be getting there, but\nwhat shall betide when we get there.  For this is not like lifting a\nherd of neat, whereof sharing is easy, but with this naked-skinned,\ntwo-legged cattle, which forsooth ye can eat and yet have, there may\nwell be strife over the sharing.  And look to it if it hath not begun\nalready:  we must needs dismount three of our best men that these\nwhite-skinned bitches forsooth may each have a horse to herself, or\nelse would they be fighting as to which should have a damsel of them\nbefore him on the saddle:  curse the fools!\n\nLaughed out they who were about him, and one young man cast a jeer at\nhim the meaning whereof they might not catch, and again they laughed;\nand that deal passed on.  And next came a bigger rout, a half score\nor so, and they also laughing and jeering; but amidst them, plain to\nsee riding a-straddle, their ankles twisted together under the\nhorses' bellies, their hands bound behind them, first Atra, black-\nclad as erst; then Aurea, in a gown of wheat-colour; then Viridis,\ngreen-clad.  Atra rode upright, and looking straight before her;\nAurea hung her head all she might, and her long red hair fell about\nher face; but Viridis had swooned, and was held up in the saddle by\none of the caitiffs on each side of her.  They were but little\ndisarrayed, save that some felon had torn the bosom of Viridis' gown,\nand dragged down the cloth so that her left shoulder was bare.\n\nArthur looked, and drew at the caitiff who went afoot beside Atra,\nand Birdalone at him who went by Viridis, for she wotted whitherward\nArthur's shaft would be turned.  The loose of the two bows made but\none sound; both men fell stark dead, and the others huddled together\na moment, and then ran toward the thicket on either hand, and they\nwho ran north, two of them saw not Arthur, because of his green\narmour, ere they felt the death which lay in his sword.  And then he\nbrake out amidst them, and there were three of them on him, yet for\nno long while, whereas their weapons bit not on the armour of the\nFaery, and his woodland blade sheared leather and ring-mail to the\nflesh and the bone:  mighty were his strokes, and presently all three\nwere wallowing on the earth.\n\nEven therewith the seven who had passed on had turned back and were\ncome on him a-horse-back; and hard had it gone with him, despite of\nhis might and his valour and the trustiness of Habundia's mail.  But\nmeanwhile Birdalone had run to Viridis, who had fallen a dead weight\naside of her horse, and lay half hanging by the bonds of her ankles.\nBirdalone swiftly cut the cords both of her feet and her hands, and\ndrew her off her horse as best she might, and laid her down on the\ngrass; and then ran to Arthur sword aloft, just as his new battle was\nat point to begin.\n\nBut as she ran it came into her mind in a twinkling that her sword\nwould be but weak, and the horn hung about her neck.  Then she stayed\nher feet, and set the horn to her lips and blew; and the oliphant\ngave forth a long singing note which was strange to hear.  But while\nit was yet at her lips one of the caitiffs was upon her, and he cried\nout:  Hah the witch, the accursed green witch! and fetched her a\ngreat stroke from his saddle, and smote her on the helm; and though\nhis sword bit not on that good head-burg, she fell to the ground\nunwitting.\n\nYet was not the wood-wife's promise unavailing, for even while the\nvoice of the horn was in the air, the way and thickets were alive\nwith men-at-arms, green-clad as those twain, who straightway fell on\nthe caitiffs, and with Arthur to help, left not one of them alive.\nThen went some to Viridis, and raised her up, and so dealt with her\nthat she came to herself again; and the like they did by Birdalone,\nand she stood, and looked about confusedly, but yet saw this, that\nthey had gotten the victory.  Some went withal to Aurea, and cut her\nbonds and took her off her horse and set her on the ground; and she\nwas all bewildered, and knew not where she was.\n\nBut Arthur, when he saw Birdalone on her feet, and unhurt by seeming,\nwent to Atra, and cut her bonds and loosed her, and set her on the\nearth, all without a word, and then stood before her shyly.  Came the\ncolour back into her face therewith, and she flushed red, for she\nknew him despite his outlandish green war-harness, and she reached\nout her hand to him, and he knelt before her and took her hand and\nkissed it.  But she bent over him till her face was anigh his, and he\nlifted up his face and kissed her mouth.  And she drew aback a\nlittle, but yet looked on him earnestly, and said:  Thou hast saved\nmy life, not from death indeed, but from a loathsome hell; I may well\nthank thee for that.  And O, if my thanks might be fruitful to thee!\nAnd her bosom heaved, and the sobs came, and the tears began to run\ndown her cheeks.  And he hung his head before her.  But in a while\nshe left weeping, and turned about her face and looked round the\nfield of deed; and she said:  Who is yonder slim green warrior who\nhath even now knelt down by Viridis?  Is it not a woman?  Arthur\nreddened:  Yea, said he; it is Birdalone.  Thy love? she said.  He\nsaid swiftly:  Yea, and thy friend, and this time thy deliverer.  So\nit is, she said.  It is five years since I beheld her.  My heart\nyearns for her; I shall rejoice at the meeting of us.\n\nShe was silent, and he also a while; then she said:  But why tarry we\nhere in idle talk when he is yet bound, and in torment of body and\nsoul; he the valiant, and the kind and the dear brother?  Come, tarry\nfor no question.  And she stepped out swiftly along the green road\ngoing westward, and Arthur beside her; and as they went by Viridis,\nlo! Aurea had wandered unto them, and now was Birdalone unhelmed and\nkissing and comforting her.  Then cried out Atra:  Keep up thine\nheart, Viridis! for now we go to fetch thee thy man safe and sound.\n\nSo they went but a little way on the green road ere they came to Sir\nHugh bound hard and fast to a tree-bole, and he naked in his shirt,\nand hard by lay the bodies of two stout carles with their throats\ncut; for these honest men and the two felons who had betrayed them\nwere all the following wherewith the Green Knight had entered\nEvilshaw.  And as it fell, the traitors had been set to watch while\nthe others slept; and sleeping the caitiffs found them, and slew the\nsaid men-at-arms at once, but bound Hugh to a tree that he might be\nthe longer a-dying; since none looked for any but their own folk to\npass by that way.  All this they heard afterwards of Hugh.\n\nBut now the said Hugh heard men going, and he opened his eyes, and\nsaw Atra and a man-at-arms with her; and he cried out:  Hah, what is\nthis now, sister? a rescue?  Yea, she said, and look thou on the face\nof the rescuer; and there is another hard by, and she is a woman.\n\nTherewith was Arthur on him and cutting his bonds, and when he was\nloose they fell into each other's arms, and Hugh spake:  Now then at\nlast doth life begin for me as I willed it!  And hast thou my sweet\nshe-fellow, Birdalone, with thee?  Yea, said Arthur.  How good is\nthat! said Hugh.  And yet, if it might but be that Baudoin were yet\nalive for us to seek!  Then he laughed and said:  These be but sorry\ngarments wherewith to wend along with dear and fair ladies, brother!\nNay, said Arthur, that may soon be amended, for yonder, where sword\nmet sword, lieth raiment abundantly on the grass.  Fie on it! said\nHugh, laughing; shall I do on me the raiment of those lousy traitors?\nNot I, by the rood!  Thou must seek further for my array, dear lad!\nSo they all laughed, and were glad to laugh together.  But Atra said:\nIt is easier even than that, for thine own fair garments and weapons\nshall we find if we seek them.  Sooth to say there was none left to\nbear them off, save it were this man, or Birdalone his mate.\n\nWith that word she looked kindly on Arthur, and again they laughed\nall three; though forsooth they were well-nigh weeping-ripe; one for\njoy, and that was Hugh; one for memory of the days gone by; and one\nfor the bitterness of love that should never be rewarded; albeit dear\neven unto her was the meeting of friends and the glory of forgiveness\nand the end of enmity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.  VIRIDIS TELLETH THE TALE OF THEIR SEEKING\n\n\n\nNow came they back to where were the three others, and Viridis was\nquite come to herself and ran to meet her man, and he took her in his\narms and caressed her sweetly; and then he turned to Birdalone, and\nspared no sign of friendly love to her; and Arthur, for his part, did\nso much for Aurea and Viridis.  No long tale there was between them\nfor that while, for they would busk them to be gone.  But first they\ndug a grave for those two poor men who had been slain by the felons,\nand prayed for them.  As for the caitiffs who lay slain there, one\nscore and two of them, they left them for the wolves to devour, and\nthe tearing of the kites and crows; nor meddled they with any of\ntheir gear or weapons.  But they speedily found Hugh's raiment, and\nhis pouch, wherein was money good store; and they found also rings\nand ouches and girdles, which had been torn from the damsels in the\nfirst rage of their taking.\n\nFirst though, when they had gathered together such horses as they\nneeded, and let the rest run wild, Birdalone brought her she-friends\ndown into the dale, and did them to bathe in a pool of the stream,\nand tended them as if she were their tire-woman, so that they were\nmightily refreshed; and she made garlands for them of the woodland\nflowers, as eglantine and honeysuckle; and herself, she bathed her,\nand did not on her battle-gear again, but clad her body in her\nwoman's array.\n\nThen she brought forth victual and wine from Habundia's store, and\nset it out on the stream-side; and thereafter she went up the bent to\nthe green way and fetched down Hugh and Arthur, and brought them to\nthe ladies, and bade them note how trim and lovely they were gotten\nagain, and again it could scarce be but that kisses and caresses were\ntoward; and in all content and love they took their breakfast, though\nbitter-sweet unto Atra had been the holding of her hand by Arthur and\nthe kissing of her cheek, albeit not for worlds had she foregone it.\n\nSo there they abode merrily for some three hours, whereas the day was\nyet young; and they asked and told each other much, so that the whole\ntale, both of the seekers from the world and of the seekers from the\nwater-side, came out little by little.  Now of the last ye have heard\nwhat there is to tell, but for the others Viridis took up the tale,\nas erst she did with the dealings of the Knights of the Quest in the\nIsle of Increase Unsought; and it seemed by her tale that Hugh and\nthe ladies, though they were living happily and prosperously in the\nland of the Green Mountains, wherein Hugh had wealth enow, yet the\nthought both of Arthur and of Birdalone would not out of their minds,\nand often it was that they thought of them, not as friends think of\nfriends of whom they are content to know that they are yet alive and\nmost-like thriving, but as friends think of friends whose absence\ncuts a shard out of their lives, so that they long to see them day by\nday.  Wherefore it came to this at last, after much talk hereof, that\nHugh left his possessions and his children (for he had two women-\nbairns born of Viridis) in the keeping of trusty folk, and took with\nhim Viridis his wife, and Aurea and Atra, and they set out to seek\nthose twain the world over till they should find them.  And first by\nthe rede of Atra they fared to Greenford, and there tarried a month,\nand sought tidings of many, and heard a word here and there whereby\nthey deemed that Birdalone had passed therethrough some little time\nbefore.  So they went thence to the Castle of the Quest, and found it\nin such plight as ye have heard, and it went sore to their hearts to\nbehold it and to be there.  But therewithal they happed upon Leonard\nthe priest, and he was rejoiced beyond measure to see them, and told\nthem all that ye have heard concerning Birdalone's coming thither and\ndeparting thence; and he told them therewith about those hauntings\nand sendings in the hall of the castle, and that they came to an end\nthe very day that Birdalone departed thence in the Sending Boat.  Yet\nfor the last three days there had been visions therein; but being\nquestioned he was loth to tell thereof, so they forbore him a while.\n\nAt these tidings they were sore moved, and they talked the matter\nover betwixt themselves (and Leonard also was in their redes), and\nthey must needs deem that either Birdalone was cast away, or that she\nhad come to her old dwelling, the House under the Wood, and belike\nhad fallen into the hands of the witch once more, and thereat were\nthey sore downcast; and yet somewhat it was, that they had heard sure\ntidings of her; though meanwhile of Arthur had they heard nought.\n\nWhile they talked this over, Atra, who had been somewhat silent,\nspake and said:  Here are we brought to a stop with the first tidings\nwhich we have heard, whereas we know no manner of wending the Great\nWater.  This seemeth evil, but let us not be cast down, or die\nredeless.  Ye have heard of what sayeth Sir Leonard of these\nhauntings in the hall, and how that they have come back again,\nwherefore why should we not sleep in the hall this night, those of us\nat least who have not so much fear as not to note them well, to see\nif we may draw any avail from them?  How say ye?  For my part I will\ntry the adventure, whatever may come of it.\n\nNow they all yeasaid it, though Aurea was somewhat timorous, albeit\nshe would not be parted from the others; so when night came there\nthey made their beds and lay down; and the end of it was, that a\nlittle before midnight Atra waked the others, and did them to wit\nthat by her deeming something was toward; and presently they were all\nfour as wide awake as ever they were in their lives; and next,\nwithout any sound that was strange, there came the image of a woman\non to the dais, clad in green like to an huntress of ancient days,\nher feet sandalled, her skirts gathered up into her girdle, so that\nher legs were naked; she had a quiver at her back, and a great bow in\nher hand.\n\nNow to all of them save Atra this appearance seemed to be the image\nof Birdalone; but she told her fellows afterwards, that to her it\nseemed not to be altogether Birdalone, but rather some other one most\nlike unto her, as it were her twin-sister.\n\nGazed the image kindly and sweetly on them, so that they beheld it\nwithout fear; and it seemed to them that it gave forth speech; yet\nnot so much that the sound of words was in the air about and smote\ntheir ears, as that the sense of words reached the minds of them.\nAnd this was the tale of it:  Ye, who are seeking the lost, have done\nwell to come hither, and now shall ye do well to wend the straightest\nway to the dwelling of the wildwood, and that is by way of the\nwestern verge of Evilshaw the forest.  Greenford is on the way.  Way-\nleaders ye shall get; be wise, yet not prudent, and take them, though\nthey be evil, and your luck may well avail.\n\nTherewith the image vanished away as it had come, and Leonard, who\nwith the others took the appearance for an image of Birdalone, said\nthat it was such as he had seen it the three last days.  So they lay\nnot down again, but departed for Greenford without tarrying, and rode\nthe other end of the short night through till they came to Greenford.\nBut Leonard would not with them; and Hugh behight him, if he lived\nand did well, to come back somehow to the Castle of the Quest, and so\nredo it that it should be no longer desolate.  So to Greenford they\ncame, and spared not to do folk to wit that they would ride a\npilgrimage in Evilshaw, and were fain of way-leaders; and there they\ndwelt a day or two, and many would let them of that journey, which,\nsaid they, was rather deadly than perilous only.  But on the third\nday came to Sir Hugh two stout carles well weaponed, who said that\nthey knew well all the ways that led to Evilshaw, and the ways that\nwent therethrough, and they offered themselves for a wage to Sir\nHugh.  Now these said carles were not over fair of favour, but seemed\nsomewhat of ribalds, nor would Sir Hugh have taken them to service in\nhis house at home; but he called to mind that it were more prudence\nthan wisdom to spoil his journey and lose the occasion of finding his\ndear friends for the hasty judgment of a man's face and demeanour,\nwherefore he waged these two men, and they set out for the western\nedges of Evilshaw.\n\nMany towns and thorps they passed through, and everywhere, when men\nknew whither they were bound, they letted them all they might in\nwords; but little heed they paid thereto, whereas they were all fixed\nin their rede that nought was to be done save the finding of their\nfriends, and that their life-days were spoiled if they found them\nnot.  And moreover, each one of them, but especially Atra and\nViridis, had dreams of the night from time to time, wherein they\nseemed to see the green-clad woman, were she Birdalone or another,\nbeckoning and bidding them to enter the Wood of Evilshaw.\n\nAs to those two way-leaders withal, whether it were that they got\nused to their faces, or that their ways and manners were nought\nuncourteous or fierce, they doubted them less and less as time wore;\nall save Viridis, whose flesh crept when they drew anigh her, as will\nbetide one who comes across an evil-looking creeping thing.  As for\nAtra, she now began to heed little the things about her, as if her\nheart were wholly set on the end of the journey.\n\nBut now at last were they come so far that they had no choice but to\nuse the said way-leaders, for they were gotten to the edge of\nEvilshaw.  So they entered it, and those two led them by half-blind\nways and paths amongst the thickets, and fumbled never with the road.\n\nFive days they went thus, and on the fifth evening they lay down to\nsleep in the wood, and it was the turn of those two hirelings to keep\nwatch and ward, and they woke not the next morn save with the hands\nof the Red Felons at their throats, so that Hugh was bound, and his\ntwo trusty men who came with him from the Green Mountains were slain\nbefore a stroke might be struck.\n\nThis was the end of Viridis' tale, save that she told how that it was\nshe that had uttered those two shrieks which Arthur and Birdalone had\nheard from the thicket; and that she had so done when the two false\nway-leaders laid hold of her to drag her away from her man, who stood\nthere before her bound to a tree that he might perish there, whereon\nthe two caitiffs had smitten her into unwit that they might have no\nmore of her cries.\n\nNow when all this had been told, and they had abided awhile in the\nfair little dale, and had said many kind endearing words of\nfriendship, they went up on the green way again, and took what of the\nhorses they needed and trussed their goods thereon (and Birdalone\nwould not leave that brave armour which Habundia had given her), and\nthey dight others for their home-riding, and the rest they turned\nloose into the woods, and so rode their ways, Birdalone going ever\nwith Atra, and Arthur by Aurea; but Viridis must needs have Hugh\nwithin reach of her hand all the way.\n\nGood speed they made, so that ere the night had fallen on them,\nthough the sun was set, they 'had come to the House under the Wood;\nand there again was joy and wondering of the new-comers, and merry\nfeasting on such simple victuals as were there, and good-night and\nrest in all contentment in the house where erst had Birdalone tholed\nso many griefs and fears.\n\n\nHere ends the Sixth Part of the Water of the Wondrous Isles, which is\ncalled The Days of Absence, and begins the Seventh Part, which is\ncalled The Days of Returning.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEVENTH PART:  THE DAYS OF RETURNING\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.  SIR HUGH ASKETH BIRDALONE WHERE SHE WOULD HAVE THE ABODE\nOF THEIR FELLOWSHIP TO BE\n\n\n\nOn the next day, they arose and were glad, and it was to them as if\nthe sun of the early summer had arisen for nought save to shine on\ntheir happy day.  And they went about from place to place whereas\ntidings had befallen Birdalone; and she served them one and all as if\nshe were their handmaid, and they loved her and caressed her, and had\nbeen fain to do all her will did they but know it.\n\nIn this wise wore day after day till June began to wane, and then on\na time came Hugh unto Birdalone, and spake unto her and said:  All we\nhave been talking together, and I am sent to ask thee what is in thy\nmind as to abiding here or going elsewhither.  For now that we be\ncome together again, not for all the kingdoms of the world would we\nsunder again; and above all, none of us would leave thee, O my\nsister.  But if thou wilt come with me to our land under the Green\nMountains, there is for thee a pleasant place and a fair dwelling,\nand honour from all folk, and our love that shall never leave thee;\nand I, and Arthur my brother, we shall win fame together amongst the\nknighthood, and thou shalt be proud and glad both of him and of me.\n\nShe said:  And if I may not go with thee thither, what other way is\nthere to escape the sundering?  Said Hugh:  This, that thou choose in\nthe world what land liketh thee for a dwelling-place, and we will go\nwith thee and leave thee never, and thou shalt be our lady and queen.\nThen he laughed and said:  Yet, our lady, I have left behind me under\nthe Green Mountains certain things which I love, as two fair women-\nchildren, and a squire or two whose fathers served my fathers, and\nwhose children I would should serve my children.  And moreover I have\nleft there certain matters of avail, my wealth and livelihood to wit.\nWilt thou begrudge it if I must needs go fetch these, and bring them\nto the land where thou dwellest, through whatever peril we may have\nto face?\n\nDear art thou, she said, and my very friend, but tell me:  how sorry\nwouldst thou be to leave thine own land and follow after me for the\nsake of one who is neither thine own true love nor of thy kindred?\nSaid he:  Not so sorry that I should grudge against thee thereafter.\nMoreover if that much of sorrow came to me, I should deem it not ill,\nlest I grow so over-happy that the luck rise up against me and undo\nme.\n\nShe said, smiling on him kindly:  Meseems that I am over-happy,\nwhereas I have such dear cherishing of noble friends.  But now I will\ntell thee all, and maybe thou wilt love me the less for the telling.\nIn these woods here, and lady and mistress of them, dwelleth one who\nis not of the race of Adam.  And she helped and cherished me and gave\nme wisdom when I was tormented and accursed, and she it was who saved\nme from the evil witch, and gave me the good hap to meet your loves\nand to fetch you to their helping; and twice hath she saved me from\nmortal peril otherwise.  And she hath found me my love, thy brother\nArthur, and delivered him from unwit and wanhope; and she it is who\ndrew all you hither unto us, and who delivered you from the felons\nwho had mastered you.  And I have sworn unto her that I would never\nwholly sunder me from her; and how shall I break mine oath and grieve\nher, even had I the will thereto, as God wot I have not?  And she\nwept therewith.\n\nBut Hugh kissed her and said:  Birdalone, my dear, why weepest thou?\nDidst thou not hear my word, that thy people should be my people, and\nthy land my land, and that whither thou goest I will go?  Dost thou\nnot trow me then?  Or how deemest thou I may tear thy friend Viridis\nfrom thee, when she hath just found thee?  But tell me, hast thou in\nthy mind any dwelling-place other than this?\n\nYea, she said:  I may not depart very far from this forest of\nEvilshaw lest I grieve my wisdom-mother overmuch.  But if one go\nwestward through the wood, he shall happen at last, when he cometh\nforth of it, on a good town hight Utterhay, which lieth on the very\nedge thereof.  There was I born, and there also I look to find three\ndear and trusty friends to whom I owe return of their much kindness.\nIt is a noble town in a pleasant land, and thou and my lord Arthur\nmay well win both honour and worship and lordship there.  And wholly\nI trust in thy word that thou wilt not grudge against me for dragging\nthee thither.\n\nTherewith she gave him her hand, smiling on him, though there was yet\ntrouble in her face.  But he took the hand and held it, and laughed\nmerrily and said:  Lo now! how good it is for friends to take counsel\ntogether!  What better may we do than go with thee thither?  And how\ngreatly will Viridis rejoice when she heareth of this.  Now will I go\nand tell her and the others.\n\nGo then, dear lad, she said; but as to the matter of thy fetching thy\nchildren and livelihood hither, that may be not so hard nor so\nperilous as thou deemest; and thou shalt go about it whenso thou\nwilt, and the sooner the better, and we shall abide thee here as long\nas need may be.  And therewith he went his ways to tell Viridis and\nthe others of this rede which they had come to between them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  BIRDALONE TAKETH COUNSEL WITH HER WOOD-MOTHER CONCERNING\nTHE MATTER OF SIR HUGH\n\n\n\nOn that same day went Birdalone to the Oak of Tryst and called her\nwood-mother to her, and she came glad and smiling, and kissed and\nembraced Birdalone, and said unto her:  Now I see that thou art well\ncontent with this last matter I have done for thee, whereas thou art\ncome to crave a new gift of me.  How knowest thou that? said\nBirdalone, laughing.  Said Habundia:\n\nWouldst thou have come to me so soon otherwise from out of all that\nhappiness?  I have come to tell thee of my rede, said Birdalone, and\nto ask thee if thou art like-minded with me thereon.  Said the wood-\nwife:  And what is thy rede, my child?  Wood-mother, said Birdalone,\nwe deem that it were good for us all to go down into Utterhay where I\nwas born, and to take up our abode therein.\n\nSaid the wood-wife:  This rede I praise, and even so would I have\ncounselled you to do; but I abided to see if it should come from out\nof thy breast, and now even so it hath done; wherefore I understand\nthy wisdom and rejoice in thee.  And now crave thy boon, my child,\nand thou shalt have it without fail.\n\nYea, said Birdalone, that will I, and the more that it is a simple\none and easy for thee to do.  Thou knowest that Hugh the Green Knight\nhath come with my she-friends seeking us all the way from under the\nGreen Mountains, and he hath left there goods that he needs must have\nand folk whom he loves; and now he would go back thither, and fetch\nall that away hither, and see to his matters as soon as may be.  And\nI would have thee counsel us what to do, whether to build a barque,\nas perchance we may get it done, and sail the lake therein to the\nCastle of the Quest or thereabout, and thence to ride to his land; or\nelse to take thy guidance and safe-conduct through the wood, and to\nbring his folk back the same way.\n\nSaid the wood-wife:  As to the way by water, I may help you little\ntherein, and meseemeth that way be many traps and wiles and many\nperils.  Wherefore I bid you try it not, but let the Green Knight\ncome up hither to this tree to-morrow before noon, all horsed and\narmed and arrayed, and there shall he find three men armed in green\ngear, horsed well, and leading two sumpter-beasts with them; and they\nshall be his until he giveth them back unto me.  But if he doubteth\nany thing betwixt the wood's end and under the Green Mountains, let\nhim wage what folk he will besides, for these my men will have money\nenough of his with them.  But by no means let him send them away till\nhe hath done with the wood altogether, both betwixt here and the\nwestern dwelt-land, and here and Utterhay, save thou be with him.\nBut while these be with him, both he and whatsoever money he bringeth\nshall be sure from all peril whiles they be in the wood.  Now, my\nchild, was not this the boon thou camest up hither to ask of me?\n\nYea verily, said Birdalone; yet also I came up hither to praise thee\nand thank thee and love thee.  And she threw herself into Habundia's\narms and kissed and caressed her, and Habundia her in like wise.\n\nSpake the wood-wife:  Thou art the beloved child of my wisdom; and\nnow I see of thee that thou wilt be faithful and true and loving unto\nme unto the end.  And I think I can see that thou and thy man shall\ndo well and happily in Utterhay; and the Green Knight also and thy\nshe-friends.  And whatsoever thou wilt of me that I may do for thee\nor thy friends, ask it freely, and freely shalt thou have it.  But\nthis I will bid thee, that the while the Green Knight shall be gone\nabout his matter, thou shalt come hither to me often; and thy friends\nalso thou shalt bring to me, that I may see them and talk to them and\nlove them.  And specially shalt thou bid Atra unto me; for meseems\nshe is so wise already that I may learn her more wisdom, and put that\ninto her heart which may solace her and make her to cease from\nfretting her own heart, and from grief and longing overmuch.  And I\nwere fain to reward her in that she hath forborne to grudge against\nthee and to bear thee enmity.  For I know, my child, not from mine\nown heart, but from the wisdom I have learned, how hardly the\nchildren of Adam may bear to have that which they love taken away\nfrom them by another, even if they themselves might in the long last\nhave wearied of it and cast it away their own selves.  Go now, my\nchild, and do thy friend to wit what I will do for him.\n\nTherewith they parted, and Birdalone fared home to the house, and\nfound the fellowship of them all sitting by the brookside, and\ntalking sweetly together in all joy and hope of what their life\nshould be in the new land whereto Birdalone would lead them.\nStraightway then she told them of Hugh and his journey, and how well\nhe should be guarded in the wood both coming and going.  And they\nthought that right good, and they thanked her and praised her, and\ntook her into their talk, and she sat down by them happily.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  OF THE JOURNEYING THROUGH THE FOREST OF EVILSHAW UNTO\nTHE TOWN OF UTTERHAY\n\n\n\nOn the morrow in due time Birdalone, going afoot, led Sir Hugh, all-\narmed and horsed, to the Oak of Tryst, and there they found the three\nmen-at-arms, well-weaponed and in green weed, abiding them.  They did\nobeisance to Sir Hugh, and he greeted them, and then without more ado\nhe kissed Birdalone and went his ways with his way-leaders, but\nBirdalone turned back to the house and her friends.\n\nNext day Birdalone brought her three she-friends unto the Trysting\nOak, and showed them to the wood-mother, and she was kind and soft\nwith them; and both Aurea and Viridis were shy with her, and as if\nthey feared her, but Atra was frank and free, and spake boldly.  And\nthereafter when Birdalone went to meet her wood-mother, Atra would go\nwith her if she were asked, and at last would go alone, when she\nfound that Habundia was fain of her coming, so that there were not\nmany days when they met not; and the wood-wife fell to learning her\nthe lore of the earth, as she had done aforetime with Birdalone; and\nAtra waxed ruddier and merrier of countenance, whereof was Birdalone\nright glad, and Arthur yet more glad, and the others well content.\n\nSo wore the time till Hugh had been gone for twenty and three days,\nand as they walked the meadows anigh the house about undern, they saw\na knight riding down the bent toward them, and presently they knew\nhim for Hugh, and turned and hastened to meet him, so that he was\nstraightway amidst them, and on foot.  Dear then were the greetings\nand caresses betwixt them, and when it was over, and Birdalone had\nled away his horse and dight it for him, and had gotten him victuals\nand drink, and they were all sitting on the grass together, he told\nthem how he had fared.  He had done all his matters in the Land under\nthe Green Mountains, and had given over his lands and houses to a man\nof his lineage, his cousin, a good knight, and had taken from him of\ngold and goods what he would.  Then he had taken his two bairns and\ntheir nurse, and an old squire and five sergeants, whereof one was\nhis foster-brother, and the others men somewhat stricken in years,\nand had departed with them.  Sithence he had come his ways to\nGreenford, and had held talk therein with the prior of a great and\nfair house of Black Canons, and had given him no little wealth\nwherewith to re-do the Castle of the Quest what was needed, and for\nlivelihood of four canons to dwell there, and Leonard to be their\nprior, that there they might remember Sir Baudoin their dear friend\ndaily in the office, and do good unto his soul.  Sithence he had\nridden to the Castle of the Quest with the said Prior of St. Austin\nof Greenford, and had found Leonard, and had settled all the business\nhow it was to be done.  Thereafter he had returned to Greenford, and\ngathered his folk, and got him gone, under the guidance of Habundia's\nfolk, by castles and thorps and towns the nearest way to the edge of\nEvilshaw.  And they had come to the forest, and ridden it six days\nwithout mishap; and when they had come to the Oak of Tryst once more,\nthe way-leaders said that it were well if all they together tarried\nnot much longer in the forest; wherefore they had brought them to a\nfair wood-lawn, and there they encamped, and were there as now.  And,\nsaid Hugh, there are they abiding me, and it is in my mind that this\nvery eve we go, all of us, and meet them there, if ye may truss your\ngoods in that while; but as to victuals, we have plenty, and it\nneedeth not.  And then to-morrow shall we wend our way as straight as\nmay be toward the good town of Utterhay.\n\nAll they yeasaid it, though in her heart maybe Birdalone had been\nfain of abiding a little longer in her own land; but she spake no\nword thereof.  And they all set to work to the trussing up of their\ngoods, and then turned their backs on the Great Water, and came up\ninto the woodland, and so to the camp in the wood-lawn.  And there\nhad Viridis a joyful meeting with her babes, and she gladdened the\nhearts of Sir Hugh's men-at-arms by her kind greeting; and they\nrejoiced in meeting Aurea and Atra again, and they wondered at\nBirdalone and her beauty, and their hearts went out to her, both the\nold men's and the young ones.  But Habundia's men looked on it all\nlike images of warriors.\n\nThere then they feasted merrily that evening.  But when the morrow\nwas come they were speedily on the way toward Utterhay; and the way-\nleaders guided them so well and wisely, that by noon of the fifth day\nthey were come forth of the wood and on to the bent that looked down\nupon the town of Utterhay.  There turned to Hugh the three way-\nleaders, and spake:  Lord, we have done thee the service which we\nwere bidden; if thou hast no further need of us, give us leave.\n\nSaid Hugh:  Leave ye have, and I shall give you a great reward ere ye\ngo.  Said the chief of them:  Nay, lord, no reward may we take, save\na token from thee that thou art content with us.  What token shall it\nbe? said Hugh.  Quoth the way-leader:  That each of us kiss the Lady\nBirdalone on the mouth, for she it is that is verily our mistress\nunder our great mistress.\n\nLaughed Hugh thereat, but the men laughed not; then spake Hugh:  This\nmust be at the lady's own will.  Even so, said they.\n\nThen Hugh brought Birdalone thither and told her what was toward, and\nshe consented to the kiss with a good will, and said to each of the\nmen after they had kissed her:  Herewith goeth my love to the\nmistress and queen of the woods; do ye bear the same unto her.  And\nthereafter those way-leaders fared back into the woods.\n\nNow they gather themselves together and go down toward Utterhay, and\nmake a brave show, what with the sumpter-horses, and the goodly array\nof the four ladies, and the glittering war-gear of the men-at-arms;\nand Sir Hugh and Sir Arthur displayed their pennons as they went.\n\nAll this saw the warders on the wall of Utterhay; and they told the\ncaptain of the porte, and he came up on to the wall, and a man with\nhim; and when he saw this bright company coming forth from the wood,\nhe bade men to him, two score of them, all weaponed, and he did on\nhis armour, and rode out-a-gates with them to meet those new-comers;\nand this he did, not because he did not see them to be but few, but\nbecause they came forth out of Evilshaw, and then doubted if they\nwere trustworthy.\n\nSo he met them two bowshots from the gate, and rode forward till he\nwas close to the wayfarers; and when he beheld the loveliness of the\nwomen, and especially of Birdalone, who wore that day the gleaming-\nglittering gown which Habundia had given her, he was abashed, and\ndeemed yet more that he had to do with folk of the Faery.  But he\nspake courteously, and said, turning to Hugh, who rode the foremost:\nFair sir, would ye tell unto the man whose business it is to\nsafeguard the good town of Utterhay what folk ye be, and on what\nerrand ye ride, and how it is that ye come forth from Evilshaw safe,\nin good case, with pennons displayed, as if the said wood were your\nvery own livelihood?  For, sooth to say, hitherto we have found this,\nthat all men dread Evilshaw, and none will enter it uncompelled.\n\nThereto answered Hugh:  I hight Sir Hugh the Green Knight, and am\ncome from under the Green Mountain; and this is Sir Arthur, called\nthe Black Squire, but a knight he is verily, and of great kindred and\na warrior most doughty.  And he hath been captain of the good town of\nGreenford west away through the wood yonder a long way, and hath done\nthe town and the frank thereof mickle good service in scattering and\ndestroying the evil companies of the Red Hold, which hold we took by\nforce of arms from the felons who held it for the torment and plague\nof the country-side.\n\nNow as to our errand, we be minded to dwell in your good town of\nUtterhay, and take our part with your folk, and we have wealth enow\nthereto, so as to be beholden to none; and as time goes on we may\nserve you in divers wise, and not least in this maybe, that with a\ngood will we shall draw sword for your peace and the freedom of them\nof Utterhay.\n\nWhen the captain heard these words, he made obeisance to Sir Hugh,\nand said:  Fair sir, though we be here a long way from Greenford, yet\nhave we heard some tale of the deeds of you, and surely the porte and\nall the folk shall be fain of your corning.  Yet I pray thee be not\nwrath; for there is a custom of the good town, that none may enter\nits gates coming from out of this Forest of Evilshaw, save he leave\nsome pledge or caution with me, be it his wealth, or the body of some\nfriend or fellow, or, if nought else, his very own body.  Wherefore\nif thou, Sir Green Knight, wilt but give us some sure pledge, then\nwill I turn about and ride with you back and through the gate into\nUtterhay; and doubtless, when the mayor hath seen you and spoken with\nyou, the said pledge shall be rendered to you again.\n\nEre Hugh might answer, came Birdalone forth and said:  Sir captain,\nif I, who am the lady of the Black Squire here, be hostage good\nenough, then take me, and if need be, chain me to make surer of me.\nAnd she drew near unto him smiling, and held out her hands as if for\nthe manacles.\n\nBut when the captain saw her thus, all the blood stirred in his body\nfor joy of her beauty, and he might but just sit his horse for his\nwonder and longing; but he said:  The saints forbid it, lady, that I\nshould do thee any hurt or displeasure, or aught save the most\nworship I may.  But thy hostage I will take, Sir Knight if thou be\ncontent to yield her, whereas in an hour belike she shall be free\nagain.  And now fare we all gateward again.\n\nSo then they all rode on together, Birdalone by the captain's left\nhand; and as they passed by the poor houses without the wall, she\nlooked and saw the one which had been her mother's dwelling, so oft\nand so closely had she told her all about it.\n\nThus then they entered Utterhay, and the captain led them straight to\nthe mote-house whereas the mayor and the porte were sitting; and much\npeople followed them through the streets, wondering at them, and\npraising the loveliness of the women, and the frank and gallant\nbearing of the men-at-arms.\n\nSo they lighted down at the mote-house and were brought to the mayor,\nand when he had spoken them but a little, and had come to himself\nagain from the fear and abashment that he had of them, he showed\nhimself full fain of their coming, and bade them welcome to the good\ntown, and took them into his own house to guesting, until folk might\ndight a very goodly house which the porte did give unto them.\n\nBut some two hours afterwards, when they were housed in all content,\nas they sat in the hall of the mayor, which was great and goodly,\ntalking and devising with worthies of Utterhay, there entered two\nfair and frank-looking young men, who went straight up to Birdalone,\nand the first knelt down before her and kissed her hand, and said:  O\nour lady, and art thou verily come to us!  O our happiness and the\njoy of this day!\n\nBut when she saw him and heard him and felt the touch of his hand,\nshe bent down to him and kissed him on the forehead, for she knew him\nthat it was Robert Gerardson.\n\nThen the other man came up to her as if he also would have knelt to\nher, but his purpose changed, and he cast his arms about her body and\nfell to kissing her face all over, weeping the while, and then he\ndrew off and stood trembling before her and she, all blushing like a\nred rose and laughing a little, and yet with the tears in her eyes,\nsaid:  O Giles Gerardson, and thou, Robert, how fain I am to see you\ntwain; but tell me, is your father well?  Yea, verily, our dear lady,\nsaid Robert, and it will be unto him as a fresh draught of youth when\nhe wotteth that thou art come to dwell amongst us; for so it is, O\nlady beloved, is it not? said he.  Yea, forsooth, or even so I hope,\nsaid Birdalone.  But here be other friends that ye must needs know,\nif we come to dwell together here in peace; and then go and fetch me\nhither your father.\n\nTherewith she presented them unto Arthur and Hugh and the three\nladies of the Quest, and all they greeted them kindly and in all\nhonour; and the Gerardsons loved and worshipped them, and especially\nthe lovely ladies, the she-friends of their lady.\n\nAnd whiles they were about this, in cometh old Gerard himself, and\nwhen Birdalone saw him at the door, she arose and ran to meet him,\nand cast her arms about him as if she were his own daughter; and most\njoyful was the meeting betwixt them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  OF THE ABIDING IN UTTERHAY IN LOVE AND CONTENTMENT\n\n\n\nNow when seven days were worn, the mayor made a great feast at his\nhouse, and thither were bidden all the men of the porte and other\nworthies, and great merchants who had come into their town; and the\nsaid feast was given in honour of these new-comers, and that day they\nsat on the dais, and all the guests worshipped them and wondered at\ntheir beauty; and nought was spoken of for many days save the glory\nand hope that there was in this lovely folk.\n\nBut the next day after the feast were they brought to their house in\nall triumph; and it was as fair as might be thought of, and there\nthey dwelt a while in rest and peace, and great recourse there was\nthere of Gerard and his sons.\n\nBut ere the winter was over, were Hugh and Arthur and Gerard and his\nsons taken to the freedom of Utterhay; and thereafter spake the chief\nmen of the porte and the masters of the crafts unto the two knights\nby the mouth of the mayor; and he told them, what already they partly\nknew, that the good town had of late gotten many enemies, whereas it\nwas wealthy and not very strong, and that now two such warriors\nhaving come amongst them, they were minded to strengthen themselves,\nif only they two would of their gentleness and meekness become their\nwar-dukes to lead them against the foemen.  But the two friends\nanswered that it was well their will to dwell there neighbourly, and\ndo them all the help they might, and that they would not gainsay the\nworship they offered them nor the work that should go with it.\n\nWith that answer were all men well content and more:  and then the\nmayor said that the mind of the porte it was to strengthen the walls\nand the gates, and to build a good and fair castle, meet for any\nearl, joining on to the wall by the face that looked west, that is to\nsay, on to Evilshaw; and that liked the war-dukes well.\n\nSo when spring came it was set about, but it was five years adoing,\nand before it was all finished the war-dukes entered into it, and\ndwelt there with their wives and their friends in all honour.  And a\nlittle thereafter, whether they would or no, the men of Utterhay had\nto handle weapons and fare afield to meet the foe with the valiant\nmen of the crafts, and what of waged men they might get.  And well\nand valiantly were they led by their dukes, and they came to their\nabove, and gained both wealth and honour thereby; and from that time\nforward began the increase of Utterhay under those two captains, who\nwere unto them as in old time the consuls had been unto the Roman\nfolk, save that they changed them not year by year as the Romans were\nwont.\n\nSo wore the days, and all those friends dwelt together in harmony and\njoy; though the wearing of time wrought changes amongst them.  For\nRobert Gerardson began in no long while to look on Aurea with eyes of\nlove; and at last he came to Birdalone and craved her leave to woo\nthe said lady, and she granted it with a good will, and was fain\nthereof, whereas she saw that Aurea sorely lacked a mate; and scarce\nmight she have a better than was Robert; so in process of time they\ntwo were wedded and dwelt together happily.\n\nForsooth Birdalone had been fainer yet might she have seen Giles\nGerardson and Atra drawn together.  But though they were dear friends\nand there was much converse betwixt them, this betid not, so far as\nwe have heard.\n\nThe old Gerard dwelt happily amongst them all for fifteen years after\nthey had come to Utterhay, and then fell asleep, a very old man.\n\nAs to the wood of Evilshaw, it was not once a year only that\nBirdalone and Arthur sought thither and met the wood-mother, but a\nhalf-score of times or more, might be, in the year's circle; and ever\nwas she kind and loving with them, and they with her.\n\nBut of all those fellows it was Atra that had longest dealings with\nthe wood-wife; for whiles would she leave Utterhay and her friends\nand fare lonesome up into Evilshaw, and find Habundia and abide with\nher in all kindness holden for a month or more.  And ever a little\nbefore these departures betid would she fall moody and few-spoken,\nbut she came back ever from the wood calm and kind and well-liking.\nAmidst all these comings and goings somewhat wore off the terror of\nEvilshaw; yet never was it accounted other than a daring deed to\nenter it alone without fellowship; and most had liefer that some man\nof religion were of their company therein, or they would bear about\nthem something holy or blessed to hold the evil things.\n\nNow when all this hath been said, we have no more to tell about this\ncompany of friends, the most of whom had once haunted the lands about\nthe Water of the Wondrous Isles, save that their love never sundered,\nand that they lived without shame and died without fear.
