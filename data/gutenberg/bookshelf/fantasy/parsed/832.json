These forests were guarded by the King's Foresters, the chief\nof whom, in each wood, was no mean man but equal in authority to the\nSheriff in his walled town, or even to my lord Bishop in his abbey.\n\nOne of the greatest of royal preserves was Sherwood and Barnesdale\nforests near the two towns of Nottingham and Barnesdale. Here for some\nyears dwelt one Hugh Fitzooth as Head Forester, with his good wife and\nson Robert. The boy had been born in Lockesley town--in the year 1160,\nstern records say--and was often called Lockesley, or Rob of Lockesley.\nHe was a comely, well-knit stripling, and as soon as he was strong\nenough to walk his chief delight was to go with his father into the\nforest. As soon as his right arm received thew and sinew he learned to\ndraw the long bow and speed a true arrow. While on winter evenings his\ngreatest joy was to hear his father tell of bold Will o' the Green, the\noutlaw, who for many summers defied the King's Foresters and feasted\nwith his men upon King's deer. And on other stormy days the boy learned\nto whittle out a straight shaft for the long bow, and tip it with gray\ngoose feathers.\n\nThe fond mother sighed when she saw the boy's face light up at these\nwoodland tales. She was of gentle birth, and had hoped to see her son\nfamous at court or abbey. She taught him to read and to write, to doff\nhis cap without awkwardness and to answer directly and truthfully both\nlord and peasant. But the boy, although he took kindly to these lessons\nof breeding, was yet happiest when he had his beloved bow in hand and\nstrolled at will, listening to the murmur of the trees.\n\nTwo playmates had Rob in these gladsome early days. One was Will\nGamewell, his father's brother's son, who lived at Gamewell Lodge, hard\nby Nottingham town. The other was Marian Fitzwalter, only child of the\nEarl of Huntingdon. The castle of Huntingdon could be seen from the top\nof one of the tall trees in Sherwood; and on more than one bright day\nRob's white signal from this tree told Marian that he awaited her there:\nfor you must know that Rob did not visit her at the castle. His father\nand her father were enemies. Some people whispered that Hugh Fitzooth\nwas the rightful Earl of Huntingdon, but that he had been defrauded out\nof his lands by Fitzwalter, who had won the King's favor by a crusade to\nthe Holy Land. But little cared Rob or Marian for this enmity, however\nit had arisen. They knew that the great green--wood was open to them,\nand that the wide, wide world was full of the scent of flowers and the\nsong of birds.\n\nDays of youth speed all too swiftly, and troubled skies come all too\nsoon. Rob's father had two other enemies besides Fitzwalter, in\nthe persons of the lean Sheriff of Nottingham and the fat Bishop of\nHereford. These three enemies one day got possession of the King's ear\nand whispered therein to such good--or evil--purpose that Hugh Fitzooth\nwas removed from his post of King's Forester. He and his wife and Rob,\nthen a youth of nineteen, were descended upon, during a cold winter's\nevening, and dispossessed without warning. The Sheriff arrested the\nForester for treason--of which, poor man, he was as guiltless as you or\nI--and carried him to Nottingham jail. Rob and his mother were sheltered\nover night in the jail, also, but next morning were roughly bade to go\nabout their business. Thereupon they turned for succor to their only\nkinsman, Squire George of Gamewell, who sheltered them in all kindness.\n\nBut the shock, and the winter night's journey, proved too much for\nDame Fitzooth. She had not been strong for some time before leaving the\nforest. In less than two months she was no more. Rob felt as though his\nheart was broken at this loss. But scarcely had the first spring flowers\nbegun to blossom upon her grave, when he met another crushing blow in\nthe loss of his father. That stern man had died in prison before his\naccusers could agree upon the charges by which he was to be brought to\ntrial.\n\nTwo years passed by. Rob's cousin Will was away at school; and Marian's\nfather, who had learned of her friendship with Rob, had sent his\ndaughter to the court of Queen Eleanor. So these years were lonely ones\nto the orphaned lad. The bluff old Squire was kind to him, but secretly\ncould make nothing of one who went about brooding and as though seeking\nfor something he had lost. The truth is that Rob missed his old life\nin the forest no less than his mother's gentleness, and his father's\ncompanionship. Every time he twanged the string of the long bow against\nhis shoulder and heard the gray goose shaft sing, it told him of happy\ndays that he could not recall.\n\nOne morning as Rob came in to breakfast, his uncle greeted him with, \"I\nhave news for you, Rob, my lad!\" and the hearty old Squire finished his\ndraught of ale and set his pewter tankard down with a crash.\n\n\"What may that be, Uncle Gamewell?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Here is a chance to exercise your good long bow and win a pretty prize.\nThe Fair is on at Nottingham, and the Sheriff proclaims an archer's\ntournament. The best fellows are to have places with the King's\nForesters, and the one who shoots straightest of all will win for prize\na golden arrow--a useless bauble enough, but just the thing for your lady\nlove, eh, Rob my boy?\" Here the Squire laughed and whacked the table\nagain with his tankard.\n\nRob's eyes sparkled. \"'Twere indeed worth shooting for, uncle mine,\" he\nsaid. \"I should dearly love to let arrow fly alongside another man. And\na place among the Foresters is what I have long desired. Will you let me\ntry?\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" rejoined his uncle. \"Well I know that your good mother\nwould have had me make a clerk of you; but well I see that the greenwood\nis where you will pass your days. So, here's luck to you in the bout!\"\nAnd the huge tankard came a third time into play.\n\nThe young man thanked his uncle for his good wishes, and set about\nmaking preparations for the journey. He traveled lightly; but his yew\nbow must needs have a new string, and his cloth-yard arrows must be of\nthe straightest and soundest.\n\nOne fine morning, a few days after, Rob might have been seen passing\nby way of Lockesley through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham town. Briskly\nwalked he and gaily, for his hopes were high and never an enemy had he\nin the wide world. But 'twas the very last morning in all his life\nwhen he was to lack an enemy! For, as he went his way through Sherwood,\nwhistling a blithe tune, he came suddenly upon a group of Foresters,\nmaking merry beneath the spreading branches of an oak-tree. They had a\nhuge meat pie before them and were washing down prodigious slices of it\nwith nut brown ale.\n\nOne glance at the leader and Rob knew at once that he had found\nan enemy. 'Twas the man who had usurped his father's place as Head\nForester, and who had roughly turned his mother out in the snow. But\nnever a word said he for good or bad, and would have passed on his way,\nhad not this man, clearing his throat with a huge gulp, bellowed out:\n\"By my troth, here is a pretty little archer! Where go you, my lad, with\nthat tupenny bow and toy arrows? Belike he would shoot at Nottingham\nFair! Ho! Ho!\"\n\nA roar of laughter greeted this sally. Rob flushed, for he was mightily\nproud of his shooting.\n\n\"My bow is as good as yours,\" he retorted, \"and my shafts will carry as\nstraight and as far. So I'll not take lessons of any of ye.\"\n\nThey laughed again loudly at this, and the leader said with frown:\n\n\"Show us some of your skill, and if you can hit the mark here's twenty\nsilver pennies for you. But if you hit it not you are in for a sound\ndrubbing for your pertness.\"\n\n\"Pick your own target,\" quoth Rob in a fine rage. \"I'll lay my head\nagainst that purse that I can hit it.\"\n\n\"It shall be as you say,\" retorted the Forester angrily, \"your head for\nyour sauciness that you hit not my target.\"\n\nNow at a little rise in the wood a herd of deer came grazing by, distant\nfull fivescore yards. They were King's deer, but at that distance seemed\nsafe from any harm. The Head Forester pointed to them.\n\n\"If your young arm could speed a shaft for half that distance, I'd shoot\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Done!\" cried Rob. \"My head against twenty pennies I'll cause yon fine\nfellow in the lead of them to breathe his last.\"\n\nAnd without more ado he tried the string of his long bow, placed a shaft\nthereon, and drew it to his ear. A moment, and the quivering string sang\ndeath as the shaft whistled across the glade. Another moment and the\nleader of the herd leaped high in his tracks and fell prone, dyeing the\nsward with his heart's blood.\n\nA murmur of amazement swept through the Foresters, and then a growl of\nrage. He that had wagered was angriest of all.\n\n\"Know you what you have done, rash youth?\" he said. \"You have killed a\nKing's deer, and by the laws of King Harry your head remains forfeit.\nTalk not to me of pennies but get ye gone straight, and let me not look\nupon your face again.\"\n\nRob's blood boiled within him, and he uttered a rash speech. \"I have\nlooked upon your face once too often already, my fine Forester. 'Tis you\nwho wear my father's shoes.\"\n\nAnd with this he turned upon his heel and strode away.\n\nThe Forester heard his parting thrust with an oath. Red with rage he\nseized his bow, strung an arrow, and without warning launched it full\naf' Rob. Well was it for the latter that the Forester's foot turned on a\ntwig at the critical instant, for as it was the arrow whizzed by his ear\nso close as to take a stray strand of his hair with it. Rob turned upon\nhis assailant, now twoscore yards away.\n\n\"Ha!\" said he. \"You shoot not so straight as I, for all your bravado.\nTake this from the tupenny bow!\"\n\nStraight flew his answering shaft. The Head Forester gave one cry, then\nfell face downward and lay still. His life had avenged Rob's father, but\nthe son was outlawed. Forward he ran through the forest, before the\nband could gather their scattered wits--still forward into the great\ngreenwood. The swaying trees seemed to open their arms to the wanderer,\nand to welcome him home.\n\nToward the close of the same day, Rob paused hungry and weary at the\ncottage of a poor widow who dwelt upon the outskirts of the forest. Now\nthis widow had often greeted him kindly in his boyhood days, giving him\nto eat and drink. So he boldly entered her door. The old dame was right\nglad to see him, and baked him cakes in the ashes, and had him rest and\ntell her his story. Then she shook her head.\n\n\"'Tis an evil wind that blows through Sherwood,\" she said. \"The poor are\ndespoiled and the rich ride over their bodies. My three sons have been\noutlawed for shooting King's deer to keep us from starving, and now hide\nin the wood. And they tell me that twoscore of as good men as ever drew\nbow are in hiding with them.\"\n\n\"Where are they, good mother?\" cried Rob. \"By my faith, I will join\nthem.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" replied the old woman at first. But when she saw that there\nwas no other way, she said: \"My sons will visit me to-night. Stay you\nhere and see them if you must.\"\n\nSo Rob stayed willingly to see the widow's sons that night, for they\nwere men after his own heart. And when they found that his mood was with\nthem, they made him swear an oath of fealty, and told him the haunt of\nthe band--a place he knew right well. Finally one of them said:\n\n\"But the band lacks a leader--one who can use his head as well as\nhis hand. So we have agreed that he who has skill enough to go to\nNottingham, an outlaw, and win the prize at archery, shall be our\nchief.\"\n\nRob sprang to his feet. \"Said in good time!\" cried he, \"for I had\nstarted to that self-same Fair, and all the Foresters, and all the\nSheriff's men in Christendom shall not stand between me and the center\nof their target!\"\n\nAnd though he was but barely grown he stood so straight and his eye\nflashed with such fire that the three brothers seized his hand and\nshouted:\n\n\"A Lockesley! a Lockesley! if you win the golden arrow you shall be\nchief of outlaws in Sherwood Forest!\"\n\nSo Rob fell to planning how he could disguise himself to go to\nNottingham town; for he knew that the Foresters had even then set a\nprice on his head in the market-place.\n\nIt was even as Rob had surmised. The Sheriff of Nottingham posted a\nreward of two hundred pounds for the capture, dead or alive, of one\nRobert Fitzooth, outlaw. And the crowds thronging the streets upon that\nbusy Fair day often paused to read the notice and talk together about\nthe death of the Head Forester.\n\nBut what with wrestling bouts and bouts with quarter-staves, and\nwandering minstrels, there came up so many other things to talk about,\nthat the reward was forgotten for the nonce, and only the Foresters\nand Sheriff's men watched the gates with diligence, the Sheriff indeed\nspurring them to effort by offers of largess. His hatred of the father\nhad descended to the son.\n\nThe great event of the day came in the afternoon. It was the archer's\ncontest for the golden arrow, and twenty men stepped forth to shoot.\nAmong them was a beggar-man, a sorry looking fellow with leggings of\ndifferent colors, and brown scratched face and hands. Over a tawny shock\nof hair he had a hood drawn, much like that of a monk. Slowly he limped\nto his place in the line, while the mob shouted in derision. But the\ncontest was open to all comers, so no man said him nay.\n\nSide by side with Rob--for it was he--stood a muscular fellow of swarthy\nvisage and with one eye hid by a green bandage. Him also the crowd\njeered, but he passed them by with indifference while he tried his bow\nwith practiced hand.\n\nA great crowd had assembled in the amphitheater enclosing the lists. All\nthe gentry and populace of the surrounding country were gathered there\nin eager expectancy. The central box contained the lean but pompous\nSheriff, his bejeweled wife, and their daughter, a supercilious young\nwoman enough, who, it was openly hinted, was hoping to receive the\ngolden arrow from the victor and thus be crowned queen of the day.\n\nNext to the Sheriff's box was one occupied by the fat Bishop of\nHereford; while in the other side was a box wherein sat a girl whose\ndark hair, dark eyes, and fair features caused Rob's heart to leap.\n'Twas Maid Marian! She had come up for a visit from the Queen's court at\nLondon town, and now sat demurely by her father the Earl of Huntingdon.\nIf Rob had been grimly resolved to win the arrow before, the sight of\nher sweet face multiplied his determination an hundredfold. He felt his\nmuscles tightening into bands of steel, tense and true. Yet withal his\nheart would throb, making him quake in a most unaccountable way.\n\nThen the trumpet sounded, and the crowd became silent while the herald\nannounced the terms of the contest. The lists were open to all comers.\nThe first target was to be placed at thirty ells distance, and all those\nwho hit its center were allowed to shoot at the second target, placed\nten ells farther off. The third target was to be removed yet farther,\nuntil the winner was proved. The winner was to receive the golden arrow,\nand a place with the King's Foresters. He it was also who crowned the\nqueen of the day.\n\nThe trumpet sounded again, and the archers prepared to shoot. Rob looked\nto his string, while the crowd smiled and whispered at the odd figure\nhe cut, with his vari-colored legs and little cape. But as the first man\nshot, they grew silent.\n\nThe target was not so far but that twelve out of the twenty contestants\nreached its inner circle. Rob shot sixth in the line and landed fairly,\nbeing rewarded by an approving grunt from the man with the green\nblinder, who shot seventh, and with apparent carelessness, yet true to\nthe bull's-eye.\n\nThe mob cheered and yelled themselves hoarse at this even marksmanship.\nThe trumpet sounded again, and a new target was set up at forty ells.\n\nThe first three archers again struck true, amid the loud applause of the\nonlookers; for they were general favorites and expected to win. Indeed\n'twas whispered that each was backed by one of the three dignitaries\nof the day. The fourth and fifth archers barely grazed the center. Rob\nfitted his arrow quietly and with some confidence sped it unerringly\ntoward the shining circle.\n\n\"The beggar! the beggar!\" yelled the crowd; \"another bull for the\nbeggar!\" In truth his shaft was nearer the center than any of the\nothers. But it was not so near that \"Blinder,\" as the mob had promptly\nchristened his neighbor, did not place his shaft just within the mark.\nAgain the crowd cheered wildly. Such shooting as this was not seen every\nday in Nottingham town.\n\nThe other archers in this round were disconcerted by the preceding\nshots, or unable to keep the pace. They missed one after another and\ndropped moodily back, while the trumpet sounded for the third round, and\nthe target was set up fifty ells distant.\n\n\"By my halidom you draw a good bow, young master,\" said Rob's queer\ncomrade to him in the interval allowed for rest. \"Do you wish me to\nshoot first on this trial?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Rob, \"but you are a good fellow by this token, and if I win\nnot, I hope you may keep the prize from yon strutters.\" And he nodded\nscornfully to the three other archers who were surrounded by their\nadmirers, and were being made much of by retainers of the Sheriff, the\nBishop, and the Earl. From them his eye wandered toward Maid Marian's\nbooth. She had been watching him, it seemed, for their eyes met; then\nhers were hastily averted.\n\n\"Blinder's\" quick eye followed those of Rob. \"A fair maid, that,\" he\nsaid smilingly, \"and one more worthy the golden arrow than the Sheriff's\nhaughty miss.\"\n\nRob looked at him swiftly, and saw naught but kindliness in his glance.\n\n\"You are a shrewd fellow and I like you well,\" was his only comment.\n\nNow the archers prepared to shoot again, each with some little care. The\ntarget seemed hardly larger than the inner ring had looked, at the first\ntrial. The first three sped their shafts, and while they were fair shots\nthey did not more than graze the inner circle.\n\nRob took his stand with some misgiving. Some flecking clouds overhead\nmade the light uncertain, and a handful of wind frolicked across the\nrange in a way quite disturbing to a bowman's nerves. His eyes wandered\nfor a brief moment to the box wherein sat the dark-eyed girl. His heart\nleaped! she met his glance and smiled at him reassuringly. And in that\nmoment he felt that she knew him despite his disguise and looked to him\nto keep the honor of old Sherwood. He drew his bow firmly and, taking\nadvantage of a momentary lull in the breeze, launched the arrow straight\nand true-singing across the range to the center of the target.\n\n\"The beggar! the beggar! a bull! a bull!\" yelled the fickle mob,\nwho from jeering him were now his warm friends. \"Can you beat that,\nBlinder?\"\n\nThe last archer smiled scornfully and made ready. He drew his bow with\nease and grace and, without seeming to study the course, released the\nwinged arrow. Forward it leaped toward the target, and all eyes followed\nits flight. A loud uproar broke forth when it alighted, just without the\ncenter and grazing the shaft sent by Rob. The stranger made a gesture\nof surprise when his own eyes announced the result to him, but saw his\nerror. He had not allowed for the fickle gust of wind which seized the\narrow and carried it to one side. But for all that he was the first to\ncongratulate the victor.\n\n\"I hope we may shoot again,\" quoth he. \"In truth I care not for the\ngolden bauble and wished to win it in despite of the Sheriff for whom I\nhave no love. Now crown the lady of your choice.\" And turning suddenly\nhe was lost in the crowd, before Rob could utter what it was upon his\nlips to say, that he would shoot again with him.\n\nAnd now the herald summoned Rob to the Sheriff's box to receive the\nprize.\n\n\"You are a curious fellow enough,\" said the Sheriff, biting his lip\ncoldly; \"yet you shoot well. What name go you by?\"\n\nMarian sat near and was listening intently.\n\n\"I am called Rob the Stroller, my Lord Sheriff,\" said the archer.\n\nMarian leaned back and smiled.\n\n\"Well, Rob the Stroller, with a little attention to your skin and\nclothes you would not be so bad a man,\" said the Sheriff. \"How like you\nthe idea of entering my service.\n\n\"Rob the Stroller has ever been a free man, my Lord, and desires no\nservice.\"\n\nThe Sheriff's brow darkened, yet for the sake of his daughter and the\ngolden arrow, he dissembled.\n\n\"Rob the Stroller,\" said he, \"here is the golden arrow which has been\noffered to the best of archers this day. You are awarded the prize. See\nthat you bestow it worthily.\"\n\nAt this point the herald nudged Rob and half inclined his head toward\nthe Sheriff's daughter, who sat with a thin smile upon her lips. But Rob\nheeded him not. He took the arrow and strode to the next box where sat\nMaid Marian.\n\n\"Lady,\" he said, \"pray accept this little pledge from a poor stroller\nwho would devote the best shafts in his quiver to serve you.\"\n\n\"My thanks to you, Rob in the Hood,\" replied she with a roguish twinkle\nin her eye; and she placed the gleaming arrow in her hair, while the\npeople shouted, \"The Queen! the Queen!\"\n\nThe Sheriff glowered furiously upon this ragged archer who had refused\nhis service, taken his prize without a word of thanks, and snubbed his\ndaughter. He would have spoken, but his proud daughter restrained him.\nHe called to his guard and bade them watch the beggar. But Rob had\nalready turned swiftly, lost himself in the throng, and headed straight\nfor the town gate.\n\nThat same evening within a forest glade a group of men--some twoscore\nclad in Lincoln green--sat round a fire roasting venison and making\nmerry. Suddenly a twig crackled and they sprang to their feet and seized\ntheir weapons.\n\n\"I look for the widow's sons,\" a clear voice said, \"and I come alone.\"\n\nInstantly the three men stepped forward.\n\n\"Tis Rob!\" they cried; \"welcome to Sherwood Forest, Rob!\" And all the\nmen came and greeted him; for they had heard his story.\n\nThen one of the widow's sons, Stout Will, stepped forth and said:\n\n\"Comrades all, ye know that our band has sadly lacked a leader--one of\nbirth, breeding, and skill. Belike we have found that leader in this\nyoung man. And I and my brothers have told him that the band would\nchoose that one who should bring the Sheriff to shame this day and\ncapture his golden arrow. Is it not so?\"\n\nThe band gave assent.\n\nWill turned to Rob. \"What news bring you from Nottingham town?\" asked\nhe.\n\nRob laughed. \"In truth I brought the Sheriff to shame for mine own\npleasure, and won his golden arrow to boot. But as to the prize ye must\ne'en take my word, for I bestowed it upon a maid.\"\n\nAnd seeing the men stood in doubt at this, he continued: \"But I'll\ngladly join your band, and you take me, as a common archer. For there\nare others older and mayhap more skilled than I.\"\n\nThen stepped one forward from the rest, a tall swarthy man. And Rob\nrecognized him as the man with the green blinder; only this was now\nremoved, and his freed eye gleamed as stoutly as the other one.\n\n\"Rob in the Hood--for such the lady called you,\" said he, \"I can vouch\nfor your tale. You shamed the Sheriff e'en as I had hoped to do; and we\ncan forego the golden arrow since it is in such fair hands. As to your\nshooting and mine, we must let future days decide. But here I, Will\nStutely, declare that I will serve none other chief save only you.\"\n\nThen good Will Stutely told the outlaws of Rob's deeds, and gave him his\nhand of fealty. And the widow's sons did likewise, and the other members\nevery one, right gladly; because Will Stutely had heretofore been the\ntruest bow in all the company. And they toasted him in nut brown ale,\nand hailed him as their leader, by the name of Robin Hood. And he\naccepted that name because Maid Marian had said it.\n\nBy the light of the camp-fire the band exchanged signs and passwords.\nThey gave Robin Hood a horn upon which he was to blow to summon them.\nThey swore, also, that while they might take money and goods from the\nunjust rich, they would aid and befriend the poor and the helpless; and\nthat they would harm no woman, be she maid, wife, or widow. They swore\nall this with solemn oaths, while they feasted about the ruddy blaze,\nunder the greenwood tree.\n\nAnd that is how Robin Hood became an outlaw.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD MET LITTLE JOHN\n\n     \"O here is my hand,\" the stranger reply'd,\n     \"I'll serve you with all my whole heart.\n     My name is John Little, a man of good mettle,\n     Ne'er doubt me for I'll play my part.\"\n\n     \"His name shall be altered,\" quoth William Stutely,\n     \"And I will his godfather be:\n     Prepare then a feast, and none of the least,\n     For we will be merry,\" quoth he.\n\nAll that summer Robin Hood and his merry men roamed in Sherwood Forest,\nand the fame of their deeds ran abroad in the land. The Sheriff of\nNottingham waxed wroth at the report, but all his traps and excursions\nfailed to catch the outlaws. The poor people began by fearing them, but\nwhen they found that the men in Lincoln green who answered Robin Hood's\nhorn meant them no harm, but despoiled the oppressor to relieve the\noppressed, they 'gan to have great liking for them. And the band\nincreased by other stout hearts till by the end of the summer fourscore\ngood men and true had sworn fealty.\n\nBut the days of quiet which came on grew irksome to Robin's adventurous\nspirit. Up rose he, one gay morn, and slung his quiver over his\nshoulders.\n\n\"This fresh breeze stirs the blood, my lads,\" quoth he, \"and I would\nbe seeing what the gay world looks like in the direction of Nottingham\ntown. But tarry ye behind in the borders of the forest, within earshot\nof my bugle call.\"\n\nThus saying he strode merrily forward to the edge of the wood, and\npaused there a moment, his agile form erect, his brown locks flowing\nand his brown eyes watching the road; and a goodly sight he made, as the\nwind blew the ruddy color into his cheeks.\n\nThe highway led clear in the direction of the town, and thither he\nboldly directed his steps. But at a bend in the road he knew of a\nby-path leading across a brook which made the way nearer and less open,\ninto which he turned. As he approached the stream he saw that it had\nbecome swollen by recent rains into quite a pretty torrent. The log\nfoot-bridge was still there, but at this end of it a puddle intervened\nwhich could be crossed only with a leap, if you would not get your feet\nwet.\n\nBut Robin cared little for such a handicap. Taking a running start, his\nnimble legs carried him easily over and balanced neatly upon the end of\nthe broad log. But he was no sooner started across than he saw a tall\nstranger coming from the other side. Thereupon Robin quickened his pace,\nand the stranger did likewise, each thinking to cross first. Midway they\nmet, and neither would yield an inch.\n\n\"Give way, fellow!\" roared Robin, whose leadership of a band, I am\nafraid, had not tended to mend his manners.\n\nThe stranger smiled. He was almost a head taller than the other.\n\n\"Nay,\" he retorted, \"fair and softly! I give way only to a better man\nthan myself.\"\n\n\"Give way, I say\", repeated Robin, \"or I shall have to show you a better\nman.\"\n\nHis opponent budged not an inch, but laughed loudly. \"Now by my\nhalidom!\" he said good-naturedly, \"I would not move after hearing that\nspeech, even if minded to it before; for this better man I have sought\nmy life long. Therefore show him to me, an it please you.\"\n\n\"That will I right soon,\" quoth Robin. \"Stay you here a little while,\ntill I cut me a cudgel like unto that you have been twiddling in your\nfingers.\" So saying he sought his own bank again with a leap, laid aside\nhis long bow and arrows, and cut him a stout staff of oak, straight,\nknotless, and a good six feet in length. But still it was a full foot\nshorter than his opponent's. Then back came he boldly.\n\n\"I mind not telling you, fellow,\" said he, \"that a bout with archery\nwould have been an easier way with me. But there are other tunes in\nEngland besides that the arrow sings.\" Here he whirred the staff about\nhis head by way of practice. \"So make you ready for the tune I am about\nto play upon your ribs. Have at you! One, two--\"\n\n\"Three!\" roared the giant smiting at him instantly.\n\nWell was it for Robin that he was quick and nimble of foot; for the blow\nthat grazed a hair's breadth from his shoulder would have felled an ox.\nNevertheless while swerving to avoid this stroke, Robin was poising for\nhis own, and back came he forthwith--whack!\n\nWhack! parried the other.\n\nWhack! whack! whack! whack!\n\nThe fight waxed fast and furious. It was strength pitted against\nsubtlety, and the match was a merry one. The mighty blows of the\nstranger went whistling around Robin's ducking head, while his own swift\nundercuts were fain to give the other an attack of indigestion. Yet each\nstood firmly in his place not moving backward or forward a foot for a\ngood half hour, nor thinking of crying \"Enough!\" though some chance blow\nseemed likely to knock one or the other off the narrow foot-bridge. The\ngiant's face was getting red, and his breath came snorting forth like\na bull's. He stepped forward with a furious onslaught to finish this\naudacious fellow. Robin dodged his blows lightly, then sprang in swiftly\nand unexpectedly and dealt the stranger such a blow upon the short ribs\nthat you would have sworn the tanner was trimming down his hides for\nmarket.\n\nThe stranger reeled and came within an ace of falling, but regained his\nfooting right quickly.\n\n\"By my life, you can hit hard!\" he gasped forth, giving back a blow\nalmost while he was yet staggering.\n\nThis blow was a lucky one. It caught Robin off his guard. His stick had\nrested a moment while he looked to see the giant topple into the water,\nwhen down came the other upon his head, whack! Robin saw more stars\nin that one moment than all the astronomers have since discovered, and\nforthwith he dropped neatly into the stream.\n\nThe cool rushing current quickly brought him to his senses, howbeit he\nwas still so dazed that he groped blindly for the swaying reeds to\npull himself up on the bank. His assailant could not forbear laughing\nheartily at his plight, but was also quick to lend his aid. He thrust\ndown his long staff to Robin crying, \"Lay hold of that, an your fists\nwhirl not so much as your head!\"\n\nRobin laid hold and was hauled to dry land for all the world like\na fish, except that the fish would never have come forth so wet and\ndripping. He lay upon the warm bank for a space to regain his senses.\nThen he sat up and gravely rubbed his pate.\n\n\"By all the saints!\" said he, \"you hit full stoutly. My head hums like a\nhive of bees on a summer morning.\"\n\nThen he seized his horn, which lay near, and blew thereon three shrill\nnotes that echoed against the trees. A moment of silence ensued, and\nthen was heard the rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs like the\ncoming of many men; and forth from the glade burst a score or two of\nstalwart yeomen, all clad in Lincoln green, like Robin, with good Will\nStutely and the widow's three sons at their head.\n\n\"Good master,\" cried Will Stutely, \"how is this? In sooth there is not a\ndry thread on your body.\"\n\n\"Why, marry,\" replied Robin, \"this fellow would not let me pass the\nfootbridge, and when I tickled him in the ribs, he must needs answer by\na pat on the head which landed me overboard.\"\n\n\"Then shall he taste some of his own porridge,\" quoth Will. \"Seize him,\nlads!\"\n\n\"Nay, let him go free,\" said Robin. \"The fight was a fair one and I\nabide by it. I surmise you also are quits?\" he continued, turning to the\nstranger with a twinkling eye.\n\n\"I am content,\" said the other, \"for verily you now have the best end of\nthe cudgel. Wherefore, I like you well, and would fain know your name.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Robin, \"my men and even the Sheriff of Nottingham know me as\nRobin Hood, the outlaw.\"\n\n\"Then am I right sorry that I beat you,\" exclaimed the man, \"for I was\non my way to seek you and to try to join your merry company. But after\nmy unmannerly use of the cudgel, I fear we are still strangers.\"\n\n\"Nay, never say it!\" cried Robin, \"I am glad I fell in with you; though,\nsooth to say, I did all the falling!\"\n\nAnd amid a general laugh the two men clasped hands, and in that clasp\nthe strong friendship of a lifetime was begun.\n\n\"But you have not yet told us your name,\" said Robin, bethinking\nhimself.\n\n\"Whence I came, men call me John Little.\"\n\n\"Enter our company then, John Little; enter and welcome. The rites are\nfew, the fee is large. We ask your whole mind and body and heart even\nunto death.\"\n\n\"I give the bond, upon my life,\" said the tall man.\n\nThereupon Will Stutely, who loved a good jest, spoke up and said: \"The\ninfant in our household must be christened, and I'll stand godfather.\nThis fair little stranger is so small of bone and sinew, that his old\nname is not to the purpose.\" Here he paused long enough to fill a horn\nin the stream. \"Hark ye, my son,\"--standing on tiptoe to splash the\nwater on the giant--\"take your new name on entering the forest. I\nchristen you Little John.\"\n\nAt this jest the men roared long and loud.\n\n\"Give him a bow, and find a full sheath of arrows for Little John,\"\nsaid Robin joyfully. \"Can you shoot as well as fence with the staff, my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"I have hit an ash twig at forty yards,\" said Little John.\n\nThus chatting pleasantly the band turned back into the woodland and\nsought their secluded dell, where the trees were the thickest, the moss\nwas the softest, and a secret path led to a cave, at once a retreat and\na stronghold. Here under a mighty oak they found the rest of the band,\nsome of whom had come in with a brace of fat does. And here they built\na ruddy fire and sat down to the meat and ale, Robin Hood in the center\nwith Will Stutely on the one hand and Little John on the other. And\nRobin was right well pleased with the day's adventure, even though he\nhad got a drubbing; for sore ribs and heads will heal, and 'tis not\nevery day that one can find a recruit as stout of bone and true of soul\nas Little John.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD TURNED BUTCHER, AND ENTERED THE SHERIFF'S SERVICE\n\n     The butcher he answered jolly Robin,\n     \"No matter where I do dwell,\n     For a butcher am I, and to Nottingham\n     Am I going, my flesh to sell.\"\n\nThe next morning the weather had turned ill, and Robin Hood's band\nstayed close to their dry and friendly cave. The third day brought a\ndiversion in the shape of a trap by a roving party of the Sheriff's men.\nA fine stag had been struck down by one Of Will Stutely's fellows, and\nhe and others had stepped forth from the covert to seize it, when twenty\nbowmen from Nottingham appeared at the end of the glade. Down dropped\nWill's men on all fours, barely in time to hear a shower of arrows\nwhistle above their heads. Then from behind the friendly trees they\nsent back such a welcome that the Sheriff's men deemed it prudent not to\ntarry in their steps. Two of them, in sooth, bore back unpleasant wounds\nin their shoulders, from the encounter.\n\nWhen they returned to town the Sheriff waxed red with rage.\n\n\"What,\" he gasped, \"do my men fear to fight this Robin Hood, face to\nface? Would that I could get him within my reach, once. We should see\nthen; we should see!\"\n\nWhat it was the Sheriff would see, he did not state. But he was to have\nhis wish granted in short space, and you and I will see how he profited\nby it.\n\nThe fourth day and the one following this friendly bout, Little John was\nmissing. One of his men said that he saw him talking with a beggar, but\ndid not know whither they had gone. Two more days passed. Robin grew\nuneasy. He did not doubt the faith of Little John, but he was fearful\nlest a roving band of Foresters had captured him.\n\nAt last Robin could not remain quiet. Up sprang he, with bow and arrows,\nand a short sword at his side.\n\n\"I must away to Nottingham town, my men,\" he cried. \"The goodly Sheriff\nhas long desired to see me; and mayhap he can tell me tidings of the\nbest quarter-staff in the shire\"--meaning Little John.\n\nOthers of the band besought him to let them go with him, but he would\nnot.\n\n\"Nay,\" he said smilingly, \"the Sheriff and I are too good friends to put\ndoubt upon our meeting. But tarry ye in the edge of the wood opposite\nthe west gate of the town, and ye may be of service ere to-morrow\nnight.\"\n\nSo saying he strode forward to the road leading to Nottingham, and stood\nas before looking up and down to see if the way was clear. Back at a\nbend in the road he heard a rumbling and a lumbering, when up drove\na stout butcher, whistling gaily, and driving a mare that sped slowly\nenough because of the weight of meat with which the cart was loaded.\n\n\"A good morrow to you, friend,\" hailed Robin. \"Whence come you and where\ngo you with your load of meat?\"\n\n\"A good morrow to you,\" returned the butcher, civilly enough. \"No matter\nwhere I dwell. I am but a simple butcher, and to Nottingham am I going,\nmy flesh to sell. 'Tis Fair week, and my beef and mutton should fetch a\nfair penny,\" and he laughed loudly at his jest. \"But whence come you?\"\n\n\"A yeoman am I, from Lockesley town. Men call me Robin Hood.\"\n\n\"The saints forefend that you should treat me ill!\" said the butcher in\nterror. \"Oft have I heard of you, and how you lighten the purses of the\nfat priests and knights. But I am naught but a poor butcher, selling\nthis load of meat, perchance, for enough to pay my quarter's rent.\"\n\n\"Rest you, my friend, rest you,\" quoth Robin, \"not so much as a silver\npenny would I take from you, for I love an honest Saxon face and a fair\nname with my neighbors. But I would strike a bargain with you.\"\n\nHere he took from his girdle a well-filled purse, and continued, \"I\nwould fain be a butcher, this day, and sell meat at Nottingham town.\nCould you sell me your meat, your cart, your mare, and your good-will,\nwithout loss, for five marks?\"\n\n\"Heaven bless ye, good Robin,\" cried the butcher right joyfully, \"that\ncan I!\" And he leaped down forthwith from the cart, and handed Robin the\nreins in exchange for the purse.\n\n\"One moment more,\" laughed Robin, \"we must e'en change garments for the\nnonce. Take mine and scurry home quickly lest the King's Foresters try\nto put a hole through this Lincoln green.\"\n\nSo saying he donned the butcher's blouse and apron, and, climbing into\nthe cart, drove merrily down the road to the town.\n\nWhen he came to Nottingham he greeted the scowling gate-keeper blithely\nand proceeded to the market-place. Boldly he led his shuffling horse to\nthe place where the butchers had their stalls.\n\nHe had no notion of the price to ask for his meat, but put on a foolish\nand simple air as he called aloud his wares:\n\n     \"Hark ye, lasses and dames, hark ye,\n     Good meat come buy, come buy,\n     Three pen'orths go for one penny,\n     And a kiss is good, say I!\"\n\nNow when the folk found what a simple butcher he was, they crowded\naround his cart; for he really did sell three times as much for one\npenny as was sold by the other butchers. And one or two serving-lasses\nwith twinkling eyes liked his comely face so well that they willingly\ngave boot of a kiss.\n\nBut the other butchers were wroth when they found how he was taking\ntheir trade; and they accordingly put their heads together.\n\nOne said, \"He is a prodigal and has sold his father's land, and this is\nhis first venture in trading.\"\n\nAnother said, \"He is a thief who has murdered a butcher, and stolen his\nhorse and meat.\"\n\nRobin heard these sayings, but only laughed merrily and sang his song\nthe louder. His good-humor made the people laugh also and crowd round\nhis cart closely, shouting uproariously when some buxom lass submitted\nto be kissed.\n\nThen the butchers saw that they must meet craft with craft; and they\nsaid to him, \"Come, brother butcher, if you would sell meat with us, you\nmust e'en join our guild and stand by the rules of our trade.\"\n\n\"We dine at the Sheriff's mansion to-day,\" said another, \"and you must\ntake one of our party.\"\n\n     \"Accurst of his heart,\" said jolly Robin,\n     \"That a butcher will deny.\n     I'll go with you, my brethren true,\n     And as fast as I can hie.\"\n\nWhereupon, having sold all his meat, he left his horse and cart in\ncharge of a friendly hostler and prepared to follow his mates to the\nMansion House.\n\nIt was the Sheriff's custom to dine various guilds of the trade, from\ntime to time, on Fair days, for he got a pretty profit out of the fees\nthey paid him for the right to trade in the market-place. The Sheriff\nwas already come with great pomp into the banqueting room, when Robin\nHood and three or four butchers entered, and he greeted them all with\ngreat condescension; and presently the whole of a large company was\nseated at a table groaning beneath the good cheer of the feast.\n\nNow the Sheriff bade Robin sit by his right hand, at the head of the\nboard; for one or two butchers had whispered to the official, \"That\nfellow is a right mad blade, who yet made us much sport to-day. He sold\nmore meat for one penny than we could sell for three; and he gave extra\nweight to whatsoever lass would buss him.\" And others said, \"He is\nsome prodigal who knows not the value of goods, and may be plucked by a\nshrewd man right closely.\"\n\nThe Sheriff was will to pluck a prodigal with the next man, and he was\nmoreover glad to have a guest who promised to enliven the feast. So, as\nI have told you, he placed Robin by his side, and he made much of him\nand laughed boisterously at his jests; though sooth to say, the laugh\nwere come by easily, for Robin had never been in merrier mood, and his\nquips and jests soon put the whole table at a roar.\n\nThen my lord Bishop of Hereford came in, last of all, to say a ponderous\ngrace and take his seat on the other side of the Sheriff--the prelate's\nfat body showing up in goodly contrast to the other's lean bones.\n\nAfter grace was said, and while the servants clattered in with the meat\nplatters, Robin stood up and said:\n\n\"An amen say I to my lord Bishop's thanks! How, now, my fine fellows, be\nmerry and drink deep; for the shot I'll pay ere I go my way, though it\ncost me five pounds and more. So my lords and gentlemen all, spare not\nthe wine, but fall to lustily.\"\n\n\"Hear! hear!\" shouted the butchers.\n\n\"Now are you a right jolly soul,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"but this feast is\nmine own. Howbeit you must have many a head of horned beasts, and many\nan acre of broad land, to spend from your purse so freely.\"\n\n\"Aye, that have I,\" returned Robin, his eyes all a twinkle, \"five\nhundred horned beasts have I and my brothers, and none of them have we\nbeen able to sell. That is why I have turned butcher. But I know not the\ntrade, and would gladly sell the whole herd, an I could find a buyer.\"\n\nAt this, the Sheriff's greed 'gan to rise. Since this fool _would_ be\nplucked, thought he, why should not he do the plucking?\n\n\"Five hundred beasts, say you?\" he queried sharply.\n\n\"Five hundred and ten fat beasts by actual count, that I would sell for\na just figure. Aye, to him who will pay me in right money, would I sell\nthem for twenty pieces of gold. Is that too much to ask, lording?\"\n\nWas there ever such an idiot butcher? thought the Sheriff; and he so far\nforgot his dignity as to nudge the Bishop in his fat ribs.\n\n\"Nay, good fellow,\" quoth he chuckling, \"I am always ready to help\nany in my shire. An you cannot find a buyer for your herd at this just\nfigure, I will e'en buy them myself.\"\n\nAt this generosity Robin was quite overcome, and fell to praising the\nSheriff to the skies, and telling him that he should not have cause to\nforget the kindness.\n\n\"Tut, tut,\" said the Sheriff, \"'tis naught but a trade. Drive in your\nherd tomorrow to the market-place and you shall have money down.\"\n\n\"Nay, excellence,\" said Robin, \"that can I not easily do, for they are\ngrazing in scattered fashion. But they are over near Gamewell, not more\nthan a mile therefrom at most. Will you not come and choose your own\nbeasts tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Aye, that I will,\" said the Sheriff, his cupidity casting his caution\nto the winds. \"Tarry with me over night, and I will go with you in the\nmorning.\"\n\nThis was a poser for Robin, since he liked not the idea of staying over\nnight at the Sheriff's house. He had hoped to appoint a meeting-place\nfor the other, but now saw that this might excite doubt. He looked\naround at the company. By this time, you must know, the feast had\nprogressed far, and the butchers were deep in their cups. The Sheriff\nand Robin had talked in a low voice, and my lord Bishop was almost\nasleep.\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Robin presently, and the words were no sooner out of his\nmouth than the door opened and a serving-man entered bearing tray of\nmulled wine. At sight of the fellow's face, Robin gave an involuntary\nstart of surprise which was instantly checked. The other also saw him,\nstood still a moment, and as if forgetting something turned about and\nleft the hall.\n\nIt was Little John.\n\nA dozen questions flashed across Robin's mind, and he could find answer\nfor none of them. What was Little John doing in the Sheriff's house? Why\nhad he not told the band? Was he true to them? Would he betray him?\n\nBut these questions of distrust were dismissed from Robin's open mind\nas soon as they had entered. He knew that Little John was faithful and\ntrue.\n\nHe recovered his spirits and began again upon a vein of foolish banter,\nfor the amusement of the Sheriff and his guests, all being now merry\nwith wine.\n\n\"A song!\" one of them shouted, and the cry was taken up round the table.\nRobin mounted his chair and trolled forth:\n\n     \"A lass and a butcher of Nottingham\n     Agreed 'twixt them for to wed.\n     Says he, 'I'll give ye the meat, fair dame,\n     And ye will give me the bread.\"\n\nThen they joined in the chorus amid a pounding of cups upon the board:\n\n     \"With a hey and a ho\n     And a hey nonny no,\n     A butcher of Nottingham!\"\n\nWhile the song was at its height, Little John reappeared, with other\nservants, and refilled the cups. He came up to Robin and, as if asking\nhim if he would have more wine, said softly, \"Meet me in the pantry\nto-night.\"\n\nRobin nodded, and sang loudly. The day was already far spent, and\npresently the company broke up with many hiccupy bows of the Sheriff and\nlittle notice of the drowsy Bishop.\n\nWhen the company was dispersed, the Sheriff bade a servant show Robin to\nhis room, and promised to see him at breakfast the next day.\n\nRobin kept his word and met Little John that night, and the sheriff next\nday; but Little John has been doing so much in the meantime that he must\nbe allowed a chapter to himself.\n\nSo let us turn to another story that was sung of, in the ballads of\nolden time, and find out how Little John entered the Sheriff's service.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nHOW LITTLE JOHN ENTERED THE SHERIFF'S SERVICE\n\n     List and hearken, gentlemen,\n     All ye that now be here,\n     Of Little John, that was Knight's-man,\n     Good mirth ye now shall hear.\n\nIt had come around another Fair day at Nottingham town, and folk crowded\nthere by all the gates. Goods of many kinds were displayed in gaily\ncolored booths, and at every cross-street a free show was in progress.\nHere and there, stages had been erected for the play at quarter-staff, a\nhighly popular sport.\n\nThere was a fellow, one Eric of Lincoln, who was thought to be the\nfinest man with the staff for miles around. His feats were sung about in\nballads through all the shire. A great boaster was he withal, and to-day\nhe strutted about on one of these corner stages, and vaunted of his\nprowess, and offered to crack any man's crown for a shilling. Several\nhad tried their skill with Eric, but he had soon sent them spinning in\nno gentle manner, amid the jeers and laughter of the onlookers.\n\nA beggar-man sat over against Eric's stage and grinned every time a pate\nwas cracked. He was an uncouth fellow, ragged and dirty and unshaven.\nEric caught sight of his leering face at one of his boasts--for there\nwas a lull in the game, because no man else wanted to come within reach\nof Eric's blows. Eric, I say, noticed the beggar-man grinning at him\nrather impudently, and turned toward him sharply.\n\n\"How now, you dirty villain!\" quoth he, \"mend your manners to your\nbetters, or, by our Lady, I'll dust your rags for you.\"\n\nThe beggar-man still grinned. \"I am always ready to mend my manners to\nmy betters,\" said he, \"but I am afraid you cannot teach me any better\nthan you can dust my jacket.\"\n\n\"Come up! Come up!\" roared the other, flourishing his staff.\n\n\"That will I,\" said the beggar, getting up slowly and with difficulty.\n\"It will pleasure me hugely to take a braggart down a notch, an some\ngood man will lend me a stout quarter-staff.\"\n\nAt this a score of idlers reached him their staves--being ready enough\nto see another man have his head cracked, even if they wished to save\ntheir own--and he took the stoutest and heaviest of all. He made a sorry\nenough figure as he climbed awkwardly upon the stage, but when he had\ngained it, he towered full half a head above the other, for all his\nawkwardness. Nathless, he held his stick so clumsily that the crowd\nlaughed in great glee.\n\nNow each man took his place and looked the other up and down, watching\nwarily for an opening. Only a moment stood they thus, for Eric, intent\non teaching this rash beggar a lesson and sweeping him speedily off the\nstage, launched forth boldly and gave the other a sounding crack on the\nshoulder. The beggar danced about, and made as though he would drop his\nstaff from very pain, while the crowd roared and Eric raised himself for\nanother crushing blow. But just then the awkward beggar came to life.\nStraightening himself like a flash, he dealt Eric a back-handed blow,\nthe like of which he had never before seen. Down went the boaster to the\nfloor with a sounding thump, and the fickle people yelled and laughed\nthemselves purple; for it was a new sight to see Eric of Lincoln eating\ndust.\n\nBut he was up again almost as soon as he had fallen, and right quickly\nretreated to his own ringside to gather his wits and watch for an\nopening. He saw instantly that he had no easy antagonist, and he came in\ncautiously this time.\n\nAnd now those who stood around saw the merriest game of quarter-staff\nthat was ever played inside the walls of Nottingham town. Both men\nwere on their guard and fenced with fine skill, being well matched in\nprowess. Again and again did Eric seek to force an opening under the\nother's guard, and just as often were his blows parried. The beggar\nstood sturdily in his tracks contenting himself with beating off the\nattack. For a long time their blows met like the steady crackling of\nsome huge forest fire, and Eric strove to be wary, for he now knew that\nthe other had no mean wits or mettle. But he grew right mad at last, and\nbegan to send down blows so fierce and fast that you would have sworn\na great hail-storm was pounding on the shingles over your head. Yet he\nnever so much as entered the tall beggar's guard.\n\nThen at last the stranger saw his chance and changed his tune of\nfighting. With one upward stroke he sent Eric's staff whirling through\nthe air. With another he tapped Eric on the head; and, with a third\nbroad swing, ere the other could recover himself, he swept him clear off\nthe stage, much as you would brush a fly off the window pane.\n\nNow the people danced and shouted and made so much ado that the\nshop-keepers left their stalls and others came running from every\ndirection. The victory of the queer beggar made him immensely popular.\nEric had been a great bully, and many had suffered defeat and insult\nat his hands. So the ragged stranger found money and food and drink\neverywhere at his disposal, and he feasted right comfortably till the\nafternoon.\n\nThen a long bow contest came on, and to it the beggar went with some of\nhis new friends. It was held in the same arena that Robin had formerly\nentered; and again the Sheriff and lords and ladies graced the scene\nwith their presence, while the people crowded to their places.\n\nWhen the archers had stepped forward, the herald rose and proclaimed the\nrules of the game: how that each man should shoot three shots, and to\nhim who shot best the prize of a yoke of fat steers should belong.\nA dozen keen-eyed bowmen were there, and among them some of the best\nfellows in the Forester's and Sheriff's companies. Down at the end of\nthe line towered the tall beggar-man, who must needs twang a bow-string\nwith the best of them.\n\nThe Sheriff noted his queer figure and asked: \"Who is that ragged\nfellow?\"\n\n\"'Tis he that hath but now so soundly cracked the crown of Eric of\nLincoln,\" was the reply.\n\nThe shooting presently began, and the targets soon showed a fine\nreckoning. Last of all came the beggar's turn.\n\n\"By your leave,\" he said loudly, \"I'd like it well to shoot with any\nother man here present at a mark of my own placing.\" And he strode down\nthe lists with a slender peeled sapling which he stuck upright in the\nground. \"There,\" said he, \"is a right good mark. Will any man try it?\"\n\nBut not an archer would risk his reputation on so small a target.\n\nWhereupon the beggar drew his bow with seeming carelessness and split\nthe wand with his shaft.\n\n\"Long live the beggar!\" yelled the bystanders.\n\nThe Sheriff swore a full great oath, and said: \"This man is the best\narcher that ever yet I saw.\" And he beckoned to him, and asked him: \"How\nnow, good fellow, what is your name, and in what country were you born?\"\n\n\"In Holderness I was born,\" the man replied; \"men call me Reynold\nGreenleaf.\"\n\n\"You are a sturdy fellow, Reynold Greenleaf, and deserve better apparel\nthan that you wear at present. Will you enter my service? I will give\nyou twenty marks a year, above your living, and three good suits of\nclothes.\"\n\n\"Three good suits, say you? Then right gladly will I enter your service,\nfor my back has been bare this many a long day.\"\n\nThen Reynold turned him about to the crowd and shouted: \"Hark ye, good\npeople, I have entered the Sheriff's service, and need not the yoke of\nsteers for prize. So take them for yourselves, to feast withal.\"\n\nAt this the crowd shouted more merrily than ever, and threw their caps\nhigh into the air. And none so popular a man had come to Nottingham town\nin many a long day as this same Reynold Greenleaf.\n\nNow you may have guessed, by this time, who Reynold Greenleaf really\nwas; so I shall tell you that he was none other than Little John. And\nforth went he to the Sheriff's house, and entered his service. But it\nwas a sorry day for the Sheriff when he got his new man. For Little John\nwinked his shrewd eye and said softly to himself: \"By my faith, I shall\nbe the worst servant to him that ever yet had he!\"\n\nTwo days passed by. Little John, it must be confessed, did not make\na good servant. He insisted upon eating the Sheriff's best bread and\ndrinking his best wine, so that the steward waxed wroth. Nathless the\nSheriff held him in high esteem, and made great talk of taking him along\non the next hunting trip.\n\nIt was now the day of the banquet to the butchers, about which we have\nalready heard. The banquet hall, you must know, was not in the main\nhouse, but connected with it by a corridor. All the servants were\nbustling about making preparations for the feast, save only Little John,\nwho must needs lie abed the greater part of the day. But he presented\nhimself at last, when the dinner was half over; and being desirous\nof seeing the guests for himself he went into the hall with the other\nservants to pass the wine. First, however, I am afraid that some of\nthe wine passed his own lips while he went down the corridor. When he\nentered the banqueting hall, whom should he see but Robin Hood himself.\nWe can imagine the start of surprise felt by each of these bold fellows\nupon seeing the other in such strange company. But they kept their\nsecrets, as we have seen, and arranged to meet each other that same\nnight. Meanwhile, the proud Sheriff little knew that he harbored the two\nchief outlaws of the whole countryside beneath his roof.\n\nAfter the feast was over and night was beginning to advance, Little John\nfelt faint of stomach and remembered him that he had eaten nothing all\nthat day. Back went he to the pantry to see what eatables were laid by.\nBut there, locking up the stores for the night, stood the fat steward.\n\n\"Good Sir Steward,\" said Little John, \"give me to dine, for it is long\nfor Greenleaf to be fasting.\"\n\nThe steward looked grimly at him and rattled the keys at his girdle.\n\n\"Sirrah lie-abed,\" quoth he, \"'tis late in the day to be talking of\neating. Since you have waited thus long to be hungry, you can e'en take\nyour appetite back to bed again.\"\n\n\"Now by mine appetite, that will I not do,\" cried Little John. \"Your\nown paunch of fat would be enough for any bear to sleep on through the\nwinter. But my stomach craves food, and food it shall have!\"\n\nSaying this he brushed past the steward and tried the door, but it\nwas locked fast; whereat the fat steward chuckled and jangled his keys\nagain.\n\nThen was Little John right mad, and he brought down his huge fist on the\ndoor-panel with a sledge-hammer blow that shivered an opening you could\nthrust your hand into. Little John stooped and peered through the hole\nto see what food lay within reach, when crack! went the steward's keys\nupon his crown, and the worthy danced around him playing a tattoo that\nmade Little John's ears ring. At this he turned upon the steward and\ngave him such a rap that his back went nigh in two, and over went the\nfat fellow rolling on the floor.\n\n\"Lie there,\" quoth Little John, \"till ye find strength to go to bed.\nMeanwhile, I must be about my dinner.\" And he kicked open the buttery\ndoor without ceremony and brought to light a venison pasty and cold\nroast pheasant--goodly sights to a hungry man. Placing these down on a\nconvenient shelf he fell to with right good will. So Little John ate and\ndrank as much as he would.\n\nNow the Sheriff had in his kitchen a cook, a stout man and bold, who\nheard the rumpus and came in to see how the land lay. There sat Little\nJohn eating away for dear life, while the fat steward was rolled under\nthe table like a bundle of rags.\n\n\"I make my vow!\" said the cook, \"you are a shrewd hind to dwell thus in\na household, and ask thus to dine.\" So saying he laid aside his spit and\ndrew a good sword that hung at his side.\n\n\"I make my vow!\" said Little John, \"you are a bold man and hardy to come\nthus between me and my meat. So defend yourself and see that you prove\nthe better man.\" And he drew his own sword and crossed weapons with the\ncook.\n\nThen back and forth they clashed with sullen sound. The old ballad which\ntells of their fight says that they thought nothing for to flee, but\nstiffly for to stand. There they fought sore together, two miles away\nand more, but neither might the other harm for the space of a full hour.\n\n\"I make my vow!\" cried Little John, \"you are the best swordsman that\never yet I saw. What say you to resting a space and eating and drinking\ngood health with me. Then we may fall to again with the swords.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" said the cook, who loved good fare as well as a good fight;\nand they both laid by their swords and fell to the food with hearty\nwill. The venison pasty soon disappeared, and the roast pheasant flew\nat as lively a rate as ever the bird itself had sped. Then the warriors\nrested a space and patted their stomachs, and smiled across at\neach other like bosom friends; for a man when he as dined looks out\npleasantly upon the world.\n\n\"And now good Reynold Greenleaf,\" said the cook, \"we may as well settle\nthis brave fight we have in hand.\"\n\n\"A true saying,\" rejoined the other, \"but first tell me, friend--for\nI protest you are my friend henceforth--what is the score we have to\nsettle?\"\n\n\"Naught save who can handle the sword best,\" said the cook. \"By my troth\nI had thought to carve you like a capon ere now.\"\n\n\"And I had long since thought to shave your ears,\" replied Little John.\n\"This bout we can settle in right good time. But just now I and my\nmaster have need of you, and you can turn your stout blade to better\nservice than that of the Sheriff.\"\n\n\"Whose service would that be?\" asked the cook.\n\n\"Mine,\" answered a would-be butcher entering the room, \"and I am Robin\nHood.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nHOW THE SHERIFF LOST THREE GOOD SERVANTS AND FOUND THEM AGAIN\n\n     \"Make good cheer,\" said Robin Hood.\n     \"Sheriff! for charity!\n     And for the love of Little John\n     Thy life is granted thee!\"\n\nThe cook gasped in amazement. This Robin Hood! and under the Sheriff's\nvery roof!\n\n\"Now by my troth you are a brave fellow,\" he said. \"I have heard great\ntales of your prowess, and the half has not been told. But who might\nthis tall slasher be?\"\n\n\"Men do call me Little John, good fellow.\"\n\n\"Then Little John, or Reynold Greenleaf, I like you well, on my honor as\nMuch the miller's son; and you too, bold Robin Hood. An you take me, I\nwill enter your service right gladly.\"\n\n\"Spoken like a stout man!\" said Robin, seizing him by the hand. \"But I\nmust back to my own bed, lest some sleepy warden stumble upon me, and\nI be forced to run him through. Lucky for you twain that wine flowed\nso freely in the house to-day; else the noise of your combat would have\nbrought other onlookers besides Robin Hood. Now if ye would flee the\nhouse to-night, I will join you in the good greenwood to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But, good master,\" said the cook, \"you would not stay here over night!\nVerily, it is running your head into a noose. Come with us. The Sheriff\nhas set strict watch on all the gates, since 'tis Fair week, but I know\nthe warden at the west gate and could bring us through safely. To-morrow\nyou will be stayed.\" \"Nay, that will I not,\" laughed Robin, \"for I shall\ngo through with no less escort than the Sheriff himself. Now do you,\nLittle John, and do you, Much the miller's son, go right speedily. In\nthe borders of the wood you will find my merry men. Tell them to kill\ntwo fine harts against to-morrow eve, for we shall have great company\nand lordly sport.\"\n\nAnd Robin left them as suddenly as he had come.\n\n\"Comrade,\" then said Little John, \"we may as well bid the Sheriff's roof\nfarewell. But ere we go, it would seem a true pity to fail to take such\nof the Sheriff's silver plate as will cause us to remember him, and also\ngrace our special feasts.\"\n\n\"'Tis well said indeed,\" quoth the cook.\n\nThereupon they got a great sack and filled it with silver plate from the\nshelves where it would not at once be missed, and they swung the sack\nbetween them, and away they went, out of the house, out of the town, and\ninto the friendly shelter of Sherwood Forest.\n\nThe next morning the servants were late astir in the Sheriff's house.\nThe steward awoke from a heavy sleep, but his cracked head was still in\nsuch a whirl that he could not have sworn whether the Sheriff had ever\nowned so much as one silver dish. So the theft went undiscovered for the\nnonce.\n\nRobin Hood met the Sheriff at breakfast, when his host soon spoke of\nwhat was uppermost in his heart--the purchase of the fine herd of cattle\nnear Gamewell. 'Twas clear that a vision of them, purchased for twenty\npaltry gold pieces, had been with him all through the night, in his\ndreams. And Robin again appeared such a silly fellow that the Sheriff\nsaw no need of dissembling, but said that he was ready to start at once\nto look at the herd.\n\nAccordingly they set forth, Robin in his little butcher's cart, behind\nthe lean mare, and the Sheriff mounted on a horse. Out of Nottingham\ntown, through gates open wide, they proceeded, and took the hill road\nleading through Sherwood Forest. And as they went on and plunged deeper\namong the trees, Robin whistled blithely and sang snatches of tunes.\n\n\"Why are you so gay, fellow?\" said the Sheriff, for, sooth to say, the\nsilence of the woods was making him uneasy.\n\n\"I am whistling to keep my courage up,\" replied Robin.\n\n\"What is there to fear, when you have the Sheriff of Nottingham beside\nyou?\" quoth the other pompously.\n\nRobin scratched his head.\n\n\"They do say that Robin Hood and his men care little for the Sheriff,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said the Sheriff. \"I would not give _that_ for their lives, if\nI could once lay hands upon them.\" And he snapped his fingers angrily.\n\"But Robin Hood himself was on this very road the last time I came to\ntown,\" said the other.\n\nThe Sheriff started at the crackling of a twig under his horse's feet,\nand looked around.\n\n\"Did you see him?\" he asked.\n\n\"Aye, that did I! He wanted the use of this mare and cart to drive to\nNottingham. He said he would fain turn butcher. But see!\"\n\nAs he spoke he came to a turn in the road, and there before them stood a\nherd of the King's deer, feeding. Robin pointed to them and continued:\n\n\"There is my herd of cattle, good Master Sheriff! How do you like them?\nAre they not fat and fair to see?\"\n\nThe Sheriff drew rein quickly. \"Now fellow,\" quoth he, \"I would I were\nwell out of this forest, for I care not to see such herds as these, or\nsuch faces as yours. Choose your own way, therefore, whoever you be, and\nlet me go mine.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" laughed Robin, seizing the Sheriff's bridle, \"I have been at too\nmuch pains to cultivate your company to forego it now so easily. Besides\nI wish you to meet some of my friends and dine with me, since you have\nso lately entertained me at your board.\"\n\nSo saying he clapped a horn on his lips and winded three merry notes.\nThe deer bounded away; and before the last of them was seen, there came\na running and a rustling, and out from behind covert and tree came full\ntwoscore of men, clad in Lincoln green, and bearing good yew bows in\ntheir hands and short swords at their sides. Up they ran to Robin Hood\nand doffed their caps to him respectfully, while the Sheriff sat still\nfrom very amazement.\n\n\"Welcome to the greenwood!\" said one of the leaders, bending the knee\nwith mock reverence before the Sheriff.\n\nThe Sheriff glared. It was Little John.\n\n\"Woe the worth, Reynold Greenleaf,\" he said, \"you have betrayed me!\"\n\n\"I make my vow,\" said Little John, \"that you are to blame, master. I was\nmisserved of my dinner, when I was at your house. But we shall set you\ndown to a feast we hope you will enjoy.\"\n\n\"Well spoken, Little John,\" said Robin Hood. \"Take you his bridle and\nlet us do honor to the guest who has come to feast with us.\"\n\nThen turning abruptly the whole company plunged into the heart of the\nforest.\n\nAfter twisting and turning till the Sheriff's bewildered head sat\ndizzily upon his shoulders, the greenwood men passed through a narrow\nalley amid the trees which led to a goodly open space flanked by\nwide-spreading oaks. Under the largest of these a pleasant fire was\ncrackling, and near it two fine harts lay ready for cooking. Around the\nblaze were gathered another company of yeomen quite as large as that\nwhich came with Robin Hood. Up sprang they as the latter advanced and\nsaluted their leader with deference, but with hearty gladness to see him\nback again.\n\nThat merry wag Will Stutely was in command; and when he saw the\npalefaced Sheriff being led in like any culprit, he took his cloak and\nlaid it humbly upon the ground and besought the Sheriff to alight upon\nit, as the ground of Sherwood was unused to such dignitaries.\n\n\"Bestir yourselves, good fellows!\" cried Robin Hood; \"and while our new\ncook, whom I see with us, is preparing a feast worthy of our high guest,\nlet us have a few games to do him honor!\"\n\nThen while the whole glade was filled with the savory smell of roasting\nvenison and fat capons, and brown pasties warmed beside the blaze,\nand mulled wine sent forth a cordial fragrance, Robin Hood placed the\nSheriff upon a knoll beneath the largest oak and sat himself down by\nhim.\n\nFirst stepped forward several pairs of men armed with the quarter-staff,\nthe widow's sons among them, and so skilfully did they thrust and parry\nand beat down guards, that the Sheriff, who loved a good game as well as\nany man, clapped his hands, forgetting where he was, and shouted, \"Well\nstruck! well struck! Never have I seen such blows at all the Fairs of\nNottingham!\"\n\nThen the best archers of the band set up a small wand at eightscore\npaces distant, and thereon they affixed a wreath of green. And the\narchers began to shoot; and he who shot not through the garland without\ndisturbing its leaves and tendrils was fain to submit to a good sound\nbuffet from Little John. But right cunning was the shooting, for the\nmen had spent a certain time in daily practice, and many were the shafts\nwhich sped daintily through the circle. Nathless now and again some\nluckless fellow would shoot awry and would be sent winding from a long\narm blow from the tall lieutenant while the glade roared with laughter.\nAnd none more hearty a guffaw was given than came from the Sheriff's own\nthroat, for the spirit of the greenwood was upon him.\n\nBut presently his high mood was dashed. The company sat down to meat,\nand the guest was treated to two more disturbing surprise. The cook came\nforward to serve the food, when the Sheriff beheld in him his own former\nservant, and one whom he supposed was at the moment in the scullery at\nNottingham.\n\nMuch the miller's son grinned by way of answer to the Sheriff's\namazement, and served the plates, and placed them before the party. Then\ndid the Sheriff gasp and fairly choke with rage. The service was his own\nsilverware from the Mansion House!\n\n\"You rascals! you rogues!\" he spluttered. \"Was it not enough to defraud\nme out of three of my servants, that you must also rob me of my best\nsilver service? Nay, by my life, but I will not touch your food!\"\n\nBut Robin Hood bade him pause.\n\n\"Gramercy!\" quoth he, \"servants come and go, in merry England, and so\ndoes service. The platters are but used to do your worship honor. And as\nfor your life, it is forfeit to your eagerness to buy my herd of cattle\nso cheaply. Now sit you down again and make good cheer, Sheriff, for\ncharity! And for the love of Little John your life is granted you!\"\n\nSo the Sheriff sat him down again, with the best face he could assume,\nand soon the cook's viands were disappearing down his gullet as rapidly\nas the next man's. And they feasted royally and clinked each other's\ncups until the sun had ceased to print the pattern of the leaves upon\nthe forest carpet.\n\nThen the Sheriff arose and said: \"I thank you, Robin Hood, one-time\nbutcher, and you, Little John, one-time beggar, and you, Much, one-time\ncook, and all you good men who have entertained me in Sherwood so well.\nPromises I make not as to how I shall requite you when next you come to\nNottingham, for I am in the King's service. So for the present the score\nrests with you. But the shadows grow long and I must away, if you will\nbe pleased to pilot me to the road.\"\n\nThen Robin Hood and all his men arose and drank the Sheriff's health,\nand Robin said: \"If you must needs go at once we will not detain\nyou--except that you have forgotten two things.\"\n\n\"What may they be?\" asked the Sheriff, while his heart sank within him.\n\n\"You forget that you came with me to-day to buy a herd of horned beasts;\nlikewise that he who dines at the Greenwood Inn must pay the landlord.\"\n\nThe Sheriff fidgeted like a small boy who has forgotten his lesson.\n\n\"Nay, I have but a small sum with me,\" he began apologetically.\n\n\"What is that sum, gossip?\" questioned Little John, \"for my own wage\nshould also come out of it!\"\n\n\"And mine!\" said Much.\n\n\"And mine!\" smiled Robin.\n\nThe Sheriff caught his breath. \"By my troth, are all these silver dishes\nworth anything?\"\n\nThe outlaws roared heartily at this.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, worship,\" said Robin, \"we three rascally\nservants will compound our back wages for those plates. And we will keep\nthe herd of cattle free for our own use--and the King's. But this little\ntavern bill should be settled! Now, what sum have you about you?\"\n\n\"I have only those twenty pieces of gold, and twenty others,\" said the\nSheriff: and well it was that he told the truth for once, for Robin\nsaid:\n\n\"Count it, Little John.\"\n\nLittle John turned the Sheriff's wallet inside out. \"'Tis true enough,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Then you shall pay no more than twenty pieces for your entertainment,\nexcellence,\" decreed Robin. \"Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?\"\n\n\"Good!\" echoed the others.\n\n\"The Sheriff should swear by his patron saint that he will not molest\nus,\" said Will Stutely; and his addition was carried unanimously.\n\n\"So be it, then,\" cried Little John, approaching the sheriff. \"Now swear\nby your life and your patron saint--\"\n\n\"I will swear it by St. George, who is patron of us all,\" said the\nSheriff vigorously, \"that I will never disturb or distress the outlaws\nin Sherwood.\"\n\n\"But let me catch any of you _out_ of Sherwood!\" thought he to himself.\n\nThen the twenty pieces of gold were paid over, and the Sheriff once more\nprepared to depart.\n\n\"Never had we so worshipful a guest before,\" said Robin; \"and as the new\nmoon is beginning to silver the leaves, I shall bear you company myself\nfor part of the way. 'Twas I who brought you into the wood.\"\n\n\"Nay, I protest against your going needlessly far,\" said Sheriff.\n\n\"But I protest that I am loath to lose your company,\" replied Robin.\n\"The next time I may not be so pleased.\"\n\nAnd he took the Sheriff's horse by the bridle rein, and led him through\nthe lane and by many a thicket till the main road was reached.\n\n\"Now fare you well, good Sheriff,\" he said, \"and when next you think to\ndespoil a poor prodigal, remember the herd you would have bought over\nagainst Gamewell. And when next you employ a servant, make certain that\nhe is not employing you.\"\n\nSo saying he smote the nag's haunch, and off went the Sheriff upon the\nroad to Nottingham.\n\nAnd that is how--you will find from many ballads that came to be sung\nat the Sheriff's expense, and which are known even to the present\nday--that, I say, is how the Sheriff lost three good servants and found\nthem again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD MET WILL SCARLET\n\n     The youngster was clothed in scarlet red\n     In scarlet fine and gay;\n     And he did frisk it o'er the plain,\n     And chanted a roundelay.\n\nOne fine morning, soon after the proud Sheriff had been brought to\ngrief, Robin Hood and Little John went strolling down a path through the\nwood. It was not far from the foot--bridge where they had fought their\nmemorable battle; and by common impulse they directed their steps to\nthe brook to quench their thirst and rest them in the cool bushes. The\nmorning gave promise of a hot day. The road even by the brook was dusty.\nSo the cooling stream was very pleasing and grateful to their senses.\n\nOn each side of them, beyond the dusty highway, stretched out broad\nfields of tender young corn. On the yon side of the fields uprose the\nsturdy oaks and beeches and ashes of the forest; while at their feet\nmodest violets peeped out shyly and greeted the loiterers with an odor\nwhich made the heart glad. Over on the far side of the brook in a tiny\nbay floated three lily-pads; and from amid some clover blossoms on the\nbank an industrious bee rose with the hum of busy contentment. It was a\nday so brimful of quiet joy that the two friends lay flat on their\nbacks gazing up at the scurrying clouds, and neither caring to break the\nsilence.\n\nPresently they heard some one coming up the road whistling gaily, as\nthough he owned the whole world and 'twas but made to whistle in. Anon\nhe chanted a roundelay with a merry note.\n\n\"By my troth, a gay bird!\" quoth Robin, raising up on his elbow. \"Let us\nlie still, and trust that his purse is not as light as his heart.\"\n\nSo they lay still, and in a minute more up came a smart stranger dressed\nin scarlet and silk and wearing a jaunty hat with a curling cock feather\nin it. His whole costume was of scarlet, from the feather to the silk\nhosen on his legs. A goodly sword hung at his side, its scabbard all\nembossed with tilting knights and weeping ladies. His hair was long and\nyellow and hung clustering about his shoulders, for all the world like a\nschoolgirl's; and he bore himself with as mincing a gait as the pertest\nof them.\n\nLittle John clucked his teeth drolly at this sight. \"By my troth, a gay\nbird!\" he said echoing the other's words--then added, \"But not so bad a\nbuild for all his prettiness. Look you, those calves and thighs are well\nrounded and straight. The arms, for all that gold-wrought cloak, hang\nstoutly from full shoulders. I warrant you the fop can use his dainty\nsword right well on occasion.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" retorted Robin, \"he is naught but a ladies' man from court. My\nlong-bow 'gainst a plugged shilling that he would run and bellow lustily\nat sight of a quarter-staff. Stay you behind this bush and I will soon\nget some rare sport out of him. Belike his silk purse may contain more\npennies than the law allows to one man in Sherwood or Barnesdale.\"\n\nSo saying Robin Hood stepped forth briskly from the covert and planted\nhimself in the way of the scarlet stranger. The latter had walked\nso slowly that he was scarce come to their resting-place; and now\non beholding Robin he neither slackened nor quickened his pace but\nsauntered idly straight ahead, looking to the right and to the left,\nwith the finest air in the world, but never once at Robin.\n\n\"Hold!\" quoth the outlaw. \"What mean ye by running thus over a wayfarer,\nrough shod?\"\n\n\"Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?\" said the stranger in a smooth\nvoice, and looking at Robin for the first time.\n\n\"Because I bid you to,\" replied Robin.\n\n\"And who may you be?\" asked the other as coolly as you please.\n\n\"What my name is matters not,\" said Robin; \"but know that I am a public\ntax-gatherer and equalizer of shillings. If your purse have more than a\njust number of shillings or pence, I must e'en lighten it somewhat; for\nthere are many worthy people round about these borders who have less\nthan the just amount. Wherefore, sweet gentleman, I pray you hand over\nyour purse without more ado, that I may judge of its weight in proper\nfashion.\"\n\nThe other smiled as sweetly as though a lady were paying him a\ncompliment.\n\n\"You are a droll fellow,\" he said calmly. \"Your speech amuses me\nmightily. Pray continue, if you have not done, for I am in no hurry this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I have said all with my tongue that is needful,\" retorted Robin,\nbeginning to grow red under the collar. \"Nathless, I have other\narguments which may not be so pleasing to your dainty skin. Prithee,\nstand and deliver. I promise to deal fairly with the purse.\"\n\n\"Alack-a-day!\" said the stranger with a little shrug of his shoulders;\n\"I am deeply sorrowful that I cannot show my purse to every rough lout\nthat asks to see it. But I really could not, as I have further need of\nit myself and every farthing it contains. Wherefore, pray stand aside.\"\n\n\"Nay that will I not! and 'twill go the harder with you if you do not\nyield at once.\"\n\n\"Good fellow,\" said the other gently, \"have I not heard all your speech\nwith patience? Now that is all I promised to do. My conscience is salved\nand I must go on my way. To-rol-o-rol-e-loo!\" he caroled, making as\nthough to depart.\n\n\"Hold, I say!\" quoth Robin hotly; for he knew how Little John must be\nchuckling at this from behind the bushes. \"Hold I say, else I shall have\nto bloody those fair locks of yours!\" And he swung his quarter-staff\nthreateningly.\n\n\"Alas!\" moaned the stranger shaking his head. \"The pity of it all! Now I\nshall have to run this fellow through with my sword! And I hoped to be a\npeaceable man henceforth!\" And sighing deeply he drew his shining blade\nand stood on guard.\n\n\"Put by your weapon,\" said Robin. \"It is too pretty a piece of steel to\nget cracked with common oak cudgel; and that is what would happen on\nthe first pass I made at you. Get you a stick like mine out of yon\nundergrowth, and we will fight fairly, man to man.\"\n\nThe stranger thought a moment with his usual slowness, and eyed Robin\nfrom head to foot. Then he unbuckled his scabbard, laid it and the sword\naside, and walked deliberately over to the oak thicket. Choosing from\namong the shoots and saplings he found a stout little tree to his\nliking, when he laid hold of it, without stopping to cut it, and gave a\ntug. Up it came root and all, as though it were a stalk of corn, and the\nstranger walked back trimming it as quietly as though pulling up trees\nwere the easiest thing in the world.\n\nLittle John from his hiding-place saw the feat, and could hardly\nrestrain a long whistle. \"By our Lady!\" he muttered to himself, \"I would\nnot be in Master Robin's boots!\"\n\nWhatever Robin thought upon seeing the stranger's strength, he uttered\nnot a word and budged not an inch. He only put his oak staff at parry as\nthe other took his stand.\n\nThere was a threefold surprise that day, by the brookside. The stranger\nand Robin and Little John in the bushes all found a combat that upset\nall reckoning. The stranger for all his easy strength and cool nerve\nfound an antagonist who met his blows with the skill of a woodman. Robin\nfound the stranger as hard to hit as though fenced in by an oak hedge.\nWhile Little John rolled over and over in silent joy.\n\nBack and forth swayed the fighters, their cudgels pounding this way and\nthat, knocking off splinters and bark, and threatening direst damage to\nbone and muscle and skin. Back and forth they pranced kicking up a cloud\nof dust and gasping for fresh air. From a little way off you would have\nvowed that these two men were trying to put out a fire, so thickly\nhung the cloud of battle over them. Thrice did Robin smite the scarlet\nman--with such blows that a less stout fellow must have bowled over.\nOnly twice did the scarlet man smite Robin, but the second blow was\nlike to finish him. The first had been delivered over the knuckles, and\nthough 'twas a glancing stroke it well nigh broke Robin's fingers, so\nthat he could not easily raise his staff again. And while he was dancing\nabout in pain and muttering a dust-covered oath, the other's staff came\nswinging through the cloud at one side--zip!--and struck him under the\narm. Down went Robin as though he were a nine-pin--flat down into the\ndust of the road. But despite the pain he was bounding up again like an\nIndia rubber man to renew the attack, when Little John interfered.\n\n\"Hold!\" said he, bursting out of the bushes and seizing the stranger's\nweapon. \"Hold, I say!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" retorted the stranger quietly, \"I was not offering to smite him\nwhile he was down. But if there be a whole nest of you hatching here by\nthe waterside, cluck out the other chicks and I'll make shift to fight\nthem all.\"\n\n\"Not for all the deer in Sherwood!\" cried Robin. \"You are a good fellow\nand a gentleman. I'll fight no more with you, for verily I feel sore in\nwrist and body. Nor shall any of mine molest you henceforth.\"\n\nSooth to say, Robin did not look in good fighting trim. His clothes were\ncoated with dirt, one of his hosen had slipped halfway down from his\nknee, the sleeve of his jerkin was split, and his face was streaked with\nsweat and dirt. Little John eyed him drolly.\n\n\"How now, good master,\" quoth he, \"the sport you were to kick up has\nleft you in sorry plight. Let me dust your coat for you.\"\n\n\"Marry, it has been dusted enough already,\" replied Robin; \"and I now\nbelieve the Scripture saying that all men are but dust, for it has\nsifted me through and through and lined my gullet an inch deep. By your\nleave\"--and he went to the brookside and drank deep and laved his face\nand hands.\n\nAll this while the stranger had been eyeing Robin attentively and\nlistening to his voice as though striving to recall it.\n\n\"If I mistake not,\" he said slowly at last, \"you are that famous outlaw,\nRobin Hood of Barnesdale.\"\n\n\"You say right,\" replied Robin; \"but my fame has been tumbling sadly\nabout in the dust to-day.\"\n\n\"Now why did I not know you at once?\" continued the stranger. \"This\nbattle need not have happened, for I came abroad to find you to-day, and\nthought to have remembered your face and speech. Know you not me, Rob,\nmy lad? Hast ever been to Gamewell Lodge?\"\n\n\"Ha! Will Gamewell! my dear old chum, Will Gamewell!\" shouted Robin,\nthrowing his arms about the other in sheer affection. \"What an ass I was\nnot to recognize you! But it has been years since we parted, and your\ngentle schooling has polished you off mightily.\"\n\nWill embraced his cousin no less heartily.\n\n\"We are quits on not knowing kinsmen,\" he said, \"for you have changed\nand strengthened much from the stripling with whom I used to run foot\nraces in old Sherwood.\"\n\n\"But why seek you me?\" asked Robin. \"You know I am an outlaw and\ndangerous company. And how left you mine uncle? and have you heard aught\nof late of--of Maid Marian?\"\n\n\"Your last question first,\" answered Will, laughing, \"for I perceive\nthat it lies nearest your heart. I saw Maid Marian not many weeks after\nthe great shooting at Nottingham, when you won her the golden arrow. She\nprizes the bauble among her dearest possessions, though it has made her\nan enemy in the Sheriff's proud daughter. Maid Marian bade me tell you,\nif I ever saw you, that she must return to Queen Eleanor's court, but\nshe could never forget the happy days in the greenwood. As for the old\nSquire, he is still hale and hearty, though rheumatic withal. He speaks\nof you as a sad young dog, but for all that is secretly proud of your\nskill at the bow and of the way you are pestering the Sheriff, whom\nhe likes not. 'Twas for my father's sake that I am now in the open, an\noutlaw like yourself. He has had a steward, a surly fellow enough, who,\nwhile I was away at school, boot-licked his way to favor until he lorded\nit over the whole house. Then he grew right saucy and impudent, but my\nfather minded it not, deeming the fellow indispensable in managing the\nestate. But when I came back it irked me sorely to see the fellow strut\nabout as though he owned the place. He was sly enough with me at first,\nand would brow-beat the Squire only while I was out of earshot. It\nchanced one day, however, that I heard loud voices through an open\nwindow and paused to hearken. That vile servant called my father 'a\nmeddling old fool,' 'Fool and meddler art thou thyself, varlet,' I\nshouted, springing through the window, '_that_ for thy impudence!' and\nin my heat I smote him a blow mightier than I intended, for I have\nsome strength in mine arm. The fellow rolled over and never breathed\nafterwards, I think I broke his neck or something the like. Then I knew\nthat the Sheriff would use this as a pretext to hound my father, if I\ntarried. So I bade the Squire farewell and told him I would seek you in\nSherwood.\"\n\n\"Now by my halidom!\" said Robin Hood; \"for a man escaping the law, you\ntook it about as coolly as one could wish. To see you come tripping\nalong decked out in all your gay plumage and trolling forth a roundelay,\none would think you had not a care in all the world. Indeed I remarked\nto Little John here that I hoped your purse was not as light as your\nheart.\"\n\n\"Belike you meant _head_,\" laughed Will; \"and is this Little John the\nGreat? Shake hands with me, an you will, and promise me to cross a staff\nwith me in friendly bout some day in the forest!\"\n\n\"That will I!\" quoth Little John heartily. \"Here's my hand on it. What\nis your last name again, say you?\"\n\n\"'Tis to be changed,\" interposed Robin; \"then shall the men armed with\nwarrants go hang for all of us. Let me bethink myself. Ah!--I have it!\nIn scarlet he came to us, and that shall be his name henceforth. Welcome\nto the greenwood, Will Scarlet!\"\n\n\"Aye, welcome, Will Scarlet!\" said Little John; and they all clasped\nhands again and swore to be true each to the other and to Robin Hood's\nmen in Sherwood Forest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD MET FRIAR TUCK\n\n     The friar took Robin Hood on his back,\n     Deep water he did bestride,\n     And spake neither good word nor bad,\n     Till he came at the other side.\n\nIn summer time when leaves grow green, and flowers are fresh and gay,\nRobin Hood and his merry men were all disposed to play. Thus runs a\nquaint old ballad which begins the next adventure. Then some would leap\nand some would run and some try archery and some ply the quarter-staff\nand some fall to with the good broad sword. Some again would try a round\nat buffet and fisticuff; and thus by every variety of sport and exercise\nthey perfected themselves in skill and made the band and its prowess\nwell known throughout all England.\n\nIt had been a custom of Robin Hood's to pick out the best men in all the\ncountryside. Whenever he heard of one more than usually skilled in\nany feat of arms he would seek the man and test him in personal\nencounter--which did not always end happily for Robin. And when he had\nfound a man to his liking he offered him service with the bold fellows\nof Sherwood Forest.\n\nThus it came about that one day after a practice at shooting, in which\nLittle John struck down a hart at five hundred feet distance, Robin Hood\nwas fain to boast.\n\n\"God's blessing on your heart!\" he cried, clapping the burly fellow on\nthe shoulder; \"I would travel an hundred miles to find one who could\nmatch you!\"\n\nAt this Will Scarlet laughed full roundly.\n\n\"There lives a curtall friar in Fountain's Abbey--Tuck, by name--who can\nbeat both him and you,\" he said.\n\nRobin pricked up his ears at this free speech.\n\n\"By our Lady,\" he said, \"I'll neither eat nor drink till I see this same\nfriar.\"\n\nAnd with his usual impetuosity he at once set about arming himself for\nthe adventure. On his head he placed a cap of steel. Underneath his\nLincoln green he wore a coat of chain metal. Then with sword and buckler\ngirded at his side he made a goodly show. But he also took with him his\nstout yew bow and a sheaf of chosen arrows.\n\nSo he set forth upon his way with blithe heart; for it was a day when\nthe whole face of the earth seemed glad and rejoicing in pulsing life.\nSteadily he pressed forward by winding ways till he came to a green\nbroad pasture land at whose edge flowed a stream dipping in and out\namong the willows and rushes on the banks. A pleasant stream it was, but\nit flowed calmly as though of some depth in the middle. Robin did not\nfancy getting his feet wet, or his fine suit of mail rusted, so he\npaused on the hither bank to rest and take his bearings.\n\nAs he sat down quietly under the shade of a drooping willow he heard\nsnatches of a jovial song floating to him from the farther side; then\ncame a sound of two men's voices arguing. One was upholding the\nmerits of hasty pudding and the other stood out stoutly for meat pie,\n\"especially\"--quoth this one--\"when flavored with young onions!\"\n\n\"Gramercy!\" muttered Robin to himself, \"that is a tantalizing speech to\na hungry man! But, odds bodikins! did ever two men talk more alike than\nthose two fellows yonder!\"\n\nIn truth Robin could well marvel at the speech, for the voices were\ncuriously alike.\n\nPresently the willows parted on the other bank, and Robin could hardly\nforebear laughing out right. His mystery was explained. It was not two\nmen who had done all this singing and talking, but one--and that one a\nstout curtall friar who wore a long cloak over his portly frame, tied\nwith a cord in the middle. On his head was a knight's helmet, and in his\nhand was a no more warlike weapon than a huge pasty pie, with which he\nsat down by the water's edge. His twofold argument was finished. The\nmeat pie had triumphed; and no wonder! for it was the present witness,\nsoon to give its own testimony.\n\nBut first the friar took off his helmet to cool his head, and a droll\npicture he made. His head was as round as an apple, and eke as smooth in\nspots. A fringe of close curling black hair grew round the base of his\nskull, but his crown was bare and shiny as an egg. His cheeks also were\nsmooth and red and shiny; and his little gray eyes danced about with\nthe funniest air imaginable. You would not have blamed Robin Hood for\nwanting to laugh, had you heard this serious two-faced talk and then\nseen this jovial one-faced man. Good humor and fat living stood out all\nover him; yet for all that he looked stout enough and able to take\ncare of himself with any man. His short neck was thick like that of a\nBerkshire bull; his shoulders were set far back, and his arms sprouted\ntherefrom like two oak limbs. As he sat him down, the cloak fell apart\ndisclosing a sword and buckler as stout as Robin's own.\n\nNathless, Robin was not dismayed at sight of the weapons. Instead, his\nheart fell within him when he saw the meat pie which was now in fair\nway to be devoured before his very eyes; for the friar lost no time in\nthrusting one hand deep into the pie, while he crossed himself with the\nother.\n\nThereupon Robin seized his bow and fitted a shaft.\n\n\"Hey, friar!\" he sang out, \"carry me over the water, or else I cannot\nanswer for your safety.\"\n\nThe other started at the unexpected greeting, and laid his hand upon\nhis sword. Then he looked up and beheld Robin's arrow pointing full upon\nhim.\n\n\"Put down your bow, fellow,\" he shouted back, \"and I will bring you over\nthe brook. 'Tis our duty in life to help each other, and your keen shaft\nshows me that you are a man worthy of some attention.\" So the friar\nknight got him up gravely, though his eyes twinkled with a cunning\nlight, and laid aside his beloved pie and his cloak and his sword and\nhis buckler, and waded across the stream with waddling dignity. Then he\ntook Robin Hood upon his back and spoke neither good word nor bad till\nhe came to the other side.\n\nLightly leaped Robin off his back, and said, \"I am much beholden to you,\ngood father.\"\n\n\"Beholden, say you!\" rejoined the other drawing his sword; \"then by my\nfaith you shall e'en repay your score. Now mine own affairs, which are\nof a spiritual kind and much more important than yours which are carnal,\nlie on the other side of this stream. I see that you are a likely man\nand one, moreover, who would not refuse to serve the church. I must\ntherefore pray of you that whatsoever I have done unto you, you will do\nalso unto me. In short, my son, you must e'en carry me back again.\"\n\nCourteously enough was this said; but so suddenly had the friar drawn\nhis sword that Robin had no time to unsling his bow from his back,\nwhither he had placed it to avoid getting it wet, or to unfasten his\nscabbard. So he was fain to temporize.\n\n\"Nay, good father, but I shall get my feet wet,\" he commenced.\n\n\"Are your feet any better than mine?\" retorted the other. \"I fear me\nnow that I have already wetted myself so sadly as to lay in a store of\nrheumatic pains by way of penance.\"\n\n\"I am not so strong as you,\" continued Robin; \"that helmet and sword and\nbuckler would be my undoing on the uncertain footing amidstream, to say\nnothing of your holy flesh and bones.\"\n\n\"Then I will lighten up, somewhat,\" replied the other calmly. \"Promise\nto carry me across and I will lay aside my war gear.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Robin; and the friar thereupon stripped himself; and\nRobin bent his stout back and took him up even as he had promised.\n\nNow the stones at the bottom of the stream were round and slippery, and\nthe current swept along strongly, waist-deep, in the middle. More-over\nRobin had a heavier load than the other had borne, nor did he know the\nford. So he went stumbling along now stepping into a deep hole, now\nstumbling over a boulder in a manner that threatened to unseat his rider\nor plunge them both clear under current. But the fat friar hung on and\ndug his heels into his steed's ribs in as gallant manner as if he were\nriding in a tournament; while as for poor Robin the sweat ran down him\nin torrents and he gasped like the winded horse he was. But at last he\nmanaged to stagger out on the bank and deposit his unwieldy load.\n\nNo sooner had he set the friar down than he seized his own sword.\n\n\"Now, holy friar,\" quoth he, panting and wiping the sweat from his brow,\n\"what say the Scriptures that you quote so glibly?--Be not weary of\nwell doing. You must carry me back again or I swear that I will make a\ncheese-cloth out of your jacket!\"\n\nThe friar's gray eyes once more twinkled with a cunning gleam that boded\nno good to Robin; but his voice was as calm and courteous as ever.\n\n\"Your wits are keen, my son,\" he said; \"and I see that the waters of the\nstream have not quenched your spirit. Once more will I bend my back to\nthe oppressor and carry the weight of the haughty.\"\n\nSo Robin mounted again in high glee, and carried his sword in his\nhand, and went prepared to tarry upon the other side. But while he\nwas bethinking himself what great words to use, when he should arrive\nthither, he felt himself slipping from the friar's broad back. He\nclutched frantically to save himself but had too round a surface to\ngrasp, besides being hampered by his weapon. So down went he with a\nloud splash into the middle of the stream, where the crafty friar had\nconveyed him.\n\n\"There!\" quoth the holy man; \"choose you, choose you, my fine fellow,\nwhether you will sink or swim!\" And he gained his own bank without more\nado, while Robin thrashed and spluttered about until he made shift to\ngrasp a willow wand and thus haul himself ashore on the other side.\n\nThen Robin's rage waxed furious, despite his wetting, and he took his\nbow and his arrows and let fly one shaft after another at the worthy\nfriar. But they rattled harmlessly off his steel buckler, while he\nlaughed and minded them no more than if they had been hail-stones.\n\n\"Shoot on, shoot on, good fellow,\" he sang out; \"shoot as you have\nbegun; if you shoot here a summer's day, your mark I will not shun!\"\n\nSo Robin shot, and passing well, till all his arrows were gone, when\nfrom very rage he began to revile him.\n\n\"You bloody villain!\" shouted he, \"You psalm-singing hypocrite! You\nreviler of good hasty pudding! Come but within reach of my sword\narm, and, friar or no friar, I'll shave your tonsure closer than ever\nbald-pated monk was shaven before!\"\n\n\"Soft you and fair!\" said the friar unconcernedly; \"hard words are\ncheap, and you may need your wind presently. An you would like a bout\nwith swords, meet me halfway i' the stream.\"\n\nAnd with this speech the friar waded into the brook, sword in hand,\nwhere he was met halfway by the impetuous outlaw.\n\nThereupon began a fierce and mighty battle. Up and down, in and out,\nback and forth they fought. The swords flashed in the rays of the\ndeclining sun and then met with a clash that would have shivered less\nsturdy weapons or disarmed less sturdy wielders. Many a smart blow was\nlanded, but each perceived that the other wore an undercoat of linked\nmail which might not be pierced. Nathless, their ribs ached at the force\nof the blows. Once and again they paused by mutual consent and caught\nbreath and looked hard each at the other; for never had either met so\nstout a fellow.\n\nFinally in a furious onset of lunge and parry Robin's foot stepped on a\nrolling stone, and he went down upon his knees. But his antagonist would\nnot take this advantage: he paused until Robin should get upon his feet.\n\n\"Now by our Lady!\" cried the outlaw, using his favorite oath, \"you are\nthe fairest swordsman that I have met in many a long day. I would beg a\nboon of you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said the other.\n\n\"Give me leave to set my horn to my mouth and blow three blasts\nthereon.\"\n\n\"That will I do,\" said the curtall friar, \"blow till your breath fails,\nan it please you.\"\n\nThen, says the old ballad, Robin Hood set his horn to mouth and blew\nmighty blasts; and half a hundred yeomen, bows bent, came raking over\nthe lee.\n\n\"Whose men are these,\" said the friar, \"that come so hastily?\"\n\n\"These men are mine,\" said Robin Hood, feeling that his time to laugh\nwas come at last.\n\nThen said the friar in his turn, \"A boon, a boon, the like I gave to\nyou. Give me leave to set my fist to my mouth and whistle three blasts\nthereon.\"\n\n\"That will I do,\" said Robin, \"or else I were lacking in courtesy.\"\n\nThe friar set his fist to his mouth and put the horn to shame by the\npiercing whistles he blew; whereupon half a hundred great dogs came\nrunning and jumping so swiftly that they had reached their bank as soon\nas Robin Hood's men had reached his side.\n\nThen followed a rare foolish conflict. Stutely, Much, Little John\nand the other outlaws began sending their arrows whizzing toward the\nopposite bank; but the dogs, which were taught of the friar, dodged the\nmissiles cleverly and ran and fetched them back again, just as the dogs\nof to-day catch sticks.\n\n\"I have never seen the like of this in my days!\" cried Little John,\namazed.\n\n\"'Tis rank sorcery and witchcraft.\"\n\n\"Take off your dogs, Friar Tuck!\" shouted Will Scarlet, who had but then\nrun up, and who now stood laughing heartily at the scene.\n\n\"Friar Tuck!\" exclaimed Robin, astounded. \"Are you Friar Tuck? Then am I\nyour friend, for you are he I came to seek.\"\n\n\"I am but a poor anchorite, a curtall friar,\" said the other, whistling\nto his pack, \"by name Friar Tuck of Fountain's Dale. For seven years\nhave I tended the Abbey here, preached o' Sundays, and married and\nchristened and buried folk--and fought too, if need were; and if it\nsmacks not too much of boasting, I have not yet met the knight or\ntrooper or yeoman that I would yield before. But yours is a stout blade.\nI would fain know you.\"\n\n\"'Tis Robin Hood, the outlaw, who has been assisting you at this\nchristening,\" said Will Scarlet glancing roguishly at the two opponents'\ndripping garments. And at this sally the whole bad burst into a shout of\nlaughter, in which Robin and Friar Tuck joined.\n\n\"Robin Hood!\" cried the good friar presently, holding his sides; \"are\nyou indeed that famous yeoman? Then I like you well; and had I known you\nearlier, would have both carried you across and shared my pasty pie with\nyou.\"\n\n\"To speak soothly,\" replied Robin gaily, \"'twas that same pie that led\nme to be rude. Now, therefore, bring it and your dogs and repair with us\nto the greenwood. We have need of you--with this message came I to-day\nto seek you. We will build you a hermitage in Sherwood Forest, and you\nshall keep us from evil ways. Will you not join our band?\"\n\n\"Marry, that will I!\" cried Friar Tuck jovially. \"Once more will I cross\nthis much beforded stream, and go with you to the good greenwood!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nHOW ALLAN-A-DALE'S WOOING WAS PROSPERED\n\n     \"What is thy name?\" then said Robin Hood,\n     \"Come tell me, without any fail!\"\n     \"By the faith o' my body,\" then said the young man,\n     \"My name it is Allan-a-Dale.\"\n\nFriar Tuck and Much the miller's son soon became right good friends over\nthe steaming stew they jointly prepared for the merry men that evening.\nTuck was mightily pleased when he found a man in the forest who could\nmake pasties and who had cooked for no less person than the High Sheriff\nhimself. While Much marveled at the friar's knowledge of herbs and\nsimples and woodland things which savored a stew greatly. So they\ngabbled together like two old gossips and, between them, made such a\ntasty mess that Robin Hood and his stout followers were like never to\nleave off eating. And the friar said grace too, with great unction, over\nthe food; and Robin said Amen! and that henceforth they were always to\nhave mass of Sundays.\n\nSo Robin walked forth into the wood that evening with his stomach full\nand his heart, therefore, in great contentment and love for other men.\nHe did not stop the first passer-by, as his manner often was, and desire\na fight. Instead, he stepped behind a tree, when he heard a man's voice\nin song, and waited to behold the singer. Perhaps he remembered, also,\nthe merry chanting of Will Scarlet, and how he had tried to give it\npause a few days before.\n\nLike Will, this fellow was clad in scarlet, though he did not look quite\nas fine a gentleman. Nathless, he was a sturdy yeoman of honest face and\na voice far sweeter than Will's. He seemed to be a strolling minstrel,\nfor he bore a harp in his hand, which he thrummed, while his lusty tenor\nvoice rang out with--\n\n     \"Hey down, and a down, and a down!\n     I've a lassie back i' the town;\n     Come day, come night, Come dark or light,\n     She will wed me, back i' the town!\"\n\nRobin let the singer pass, caroling on his way.\n\n\"'Tis not in me to disturb a light-hearted lover, this night,\" he\nmuttered, a memory of Marian coming back to him. \"Pray heaven she may be\ntrue to him and the wedding be a gay one 'back i' the town!\"'\n\nSo Robin went back to his camp, where he told of the minstrel.\n\n\"If any of ye set on him after this,\" quoth he in ending, \"bring him to\nme, for I would have speech with him.\"\n\nThe very next day his wish was gratified. Little John and Much the\nmiller's son were out together on a foraging expedition when they espied\nthe same young man; at least, they thought it must be he, for he was\nclad in scarlet and carried a harp in his hand. But now he came drooping\nalong the way; his scarlet was all in tatters; and at every step he\nfetched a sigh, \"Alack and a well-a-day!\"\n\nThen stepped forth Little John and Much the miller's son.\n\n\"Ho! do not wet the earth with your weeping,\" said Little John, \"else we\nshall all have lumbago.\"\n\nNo sooner did the young man catch sight of them than he bent his bow,\nand held an arrow back to his ear.\n\n\"Stand off! stand off!\" he said; \"what is your will with me?\"\n\n\"Put by your weapon,\" said Much, \"we will not harm you. But you must\ncome before our master straight, under yon greenwood tree.\"\n\nSo the minstrel put by his bow and suffered himself to be led before\nRobin Hood.\n\n\"How now!\" quoth Robin, when he beheld his sorry countenance, \"are you\nnot he whom I heard no longer ago than yesternight caroling so blithely\nabout 'a lassie back i' the town'?\"\n\n\"The same in body, good sir,\" replied the other sadly; \"but my spirit is\ngrievously changed.\"\n\n\"Tell me your tale,\" said Robin courteously. \"Belike I can help you.\"\n\n\"That can no man on earth, I fear,\" said the stranger; \"nathless, I'll\ntell you the tale. Yesterday I stood pledged to a maid, and thought\nsoon to wed her. But she has been taken from me and is to become an\nold knight's bride this very day; and as for me, I care not what ending\ncomes to my days, or how soon, without her.\"\n\n\"Marry, come up!\" said Robin; \"how got the old knight so sudden\nvantage?\"\n\n\"Look you, worship, 'tis this way. The Normans overrun us, and are in\nsuch great favor that none may say them nay. This old returned Crusader\ncoveted the land whereon my lady dwells. The estate is not large, but\nall in her own right; whereupon her brother says she shall wed a title,\nand he and the old knight have fixed it up for to-day.\"\n\n\"Nay, but surely--\" began Robin.\n\n\"Hear me out, worship,\" said the other. \"Belike you think me a sorry\ndog not to make fight of this. But the old knight, look you, is not\ncome-at-able. I threw one of his varlets into a thorn hedge, and another\ninto a water-butt, and a third landed head-first into a ditch. But I\ncouldn't do any fighting at all.\"\n\n\"'Tis a pity!\" quoth Little John gravely. He had been sitting\ncross-legged listening to this tale of woe. \"What think you, Friar Tuck,\ndoth not a bit of fighting ease a man's mind?\"\n\n\"Blood-letting is ofttimes recommended of the leeches,\" replied Tuck.\n\n\"Does the maid love you?\" asked Robin Hood.\n\n\"By our troth, she loved me right well,\" said the minstrel. \"I have a\nlittle ring of hers by me which I have kept for seven long years.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" then said Robin Hood.\n\n\"By the faith of my body,\" replied the young man, \"my name is\nAllan-a-Dale.\"\n\n\"What will you give me, Allan-a-Dale,\" said Robin Hood, \"in ready gold\nor fee, to help you to your true love again, and deliver her back unto\nyou?\"\n\n\"I have no money, save only five shillings,\" quoth Allan; \"but--are you\nnot Robin Hood?\"\n\nRobin nodded.\n\n\"Then you, if any one, can aid me!\" said Allan-a-Dale eagerly. \"And if\nyou give me back my love, I swear upon the Book that I will be your true\nservant forever after.\"\n\n\"Where is this wedding to take place, and when?\" asked Robin.\n\n\"At Plympton Church, scarce five miles from here; and at three o' the\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Then to Plympton we will go!\" cried Robin suddenly springing into\naction; and he gave out orders like a general: \"Will Stutely, do you\nhave four-and-twenty good men over against Plympton Church 'gainst three\no' the afternoon. Much, good fellow, do you cook up some porridge for\nthis youth, for he must have a good round stomach--aye, and a better\ngear! Will Scarlet, you will see to decking him out bravely for the\nnonce. And Friar Tuck, hold yourself in readiness, good book in hand, at\nthe church. Mayhap you had best go ahead of us all.\"\n\nThe fat Bishop of Hereford was full of pomp and importance that day at\nPlympton Church. He was to celebrate the marriage of an old knight--a\nreturned Crusader--and a landed young woman; and all the gentry\nthereabout were to grace the occasion with their presence. The church\nitself was gaily festooned with flowers for the ceremony, while out\nin the church-yard at one side brown ale flowed freely for all the\nservitors.\n\nAlready were the guests beginning to assemble, when the Bishop, back in\nthe vestry, saw a minstrel clad in green walk up boldly to the door and\npeer within. It was Robin Hood, who had borrowed Allan's be-ribboned\nharp for the time.\n\n\"Now who are you, fellow?\" quoth the Bishop, \"and what do you here at\nthe church-door with you harp and saucy air?\"\n\n\"May it please your Reverence,\" returned Robin bowing very humbly, \"I\nam but a strolling harper, yet likened the best in the whole North\nCountree. And I had hope that my thrumming might add zest to the wedding\nto-day.\"\n\n\"What tune can you harp?\" demanded the Bishop.\n\n\"I can harp a tune so merry that a forlorn lover will forget he is\njilted,\" said Robin. \"I can harp another tune that will make a bride\nforsake her lord at the altar. I can harp another tune that will bring\nloving souls together though they were up hill and down dale five good\nmiles away from each other.\"\n\n\"Then welcome, good minstrel,\" said the Bishop, \"music pleases me right\nwell, and if you can play up to your prattle, 'twill indeed grace your\nceremony. Let us have a sample of your wares.\"\n\n\"Nay, I must not put finger to string until the bride and groom have\ncome. Such a thing would ill fortune both us and them.\"\n\n\"Have it as you will,\" said the Bishop, \"but here comes the party now.\"\n\nThen up the lane to the church came the old knight, preceded by ten\narchers liveried in scarlet and gold. A brave sight the archers made,\nbut their master walked slowly leaning upon a cane and shaking as though\nin a palsy.\n\nAnd after them came a sweet lass leaning upon her brother's arm. Her\nhair did shine like glistering gold, and her eyes were like blue violets\nthat peep out shyly at the sun. The color came and went in her cheeks\nlike that tinting of a sea-shell, and her face was flushed as though\nshe had been weeping. But now she walked with a proud air, as though she\ndefied the world to crush her spirit. She had but two maids with her,\nfinikin lasses, with black eyes and broad bosoms, who set off their\nlady's more delicate beauty well. One held up the bride's gown from the\nground; the other carried flowers in plenty.\n\n\"Now by all the wedding bells that ever were rung!\" quoth Robin boldly,\n\"this is the worst matched pair that ever mine eyes beheld!\"\n\n\"Silence, miscreant!\" said a man who stood near.\n\nThe Bishop had hurriedly donned his gown and now stood ready to meet the\ncouple at the chancel.\n\nBut Robin paid no heed to him. He let the knight and his ten archers\npass by, then he strode up to the bride, and placed himself on the other\nside from her brother.\n\n\"Courage, lady!\" he whispered, \"there is another minstrel near, who\nmayhap may play more to your liking.\"\n\nThe lady glanced at him with a frightened air, but read such honesty and\nkindness in his glance that she brightened and gave him a grateful look.\n\n\"Stand aside, fool!\" cried the brother wrathfully.\n\n\"Nay, but I am to bring good fortune to the bride by accompanying her\nthrough the church-doors,\" said Robin laughing.\n\nThereupon he was allowed to walk by her side unmolested, up to the\nchancel with the party.\n\n\"Now strike up your music, fellow!\" ordered the Bishop.\n\n\"Right gladly will I,\" quoth Robin, \"an you will let me choose my\ninstrument. For sometimes I like the harp, and other times I think the\nhorn makes the merriest music in all the world.\"\n\nAnd he drew forth his bugle from underneath his green cloak and blew\nthree winding notes that made the church--rafters ring again.\n\n\"Seize him!\" yelled the Bishop; \"there's mischief afoot! These are the\ntricks of Robin Hood!\"\n\nThe ten liveried archers rushed forward from the rear of the church,\nwhere they had been stationed. But their rush was blocked by the\nonlookers who now rose from their pews in alarm and crowded the aisles.\nMeanwhile Robin had leaped lightly over the chancel rail and stationed\nhimself in a nook by the altar.\n\n\"Stand where you are!\" he shouted, drawing his bow, \"the first man to\npass the rail dies the death. And all ye who have come to witness a\nwedding stay in your seats. We shall e'en have one, since we are come\ninto the church. But the bride shall choose her own swain!\"\n\nThen up rose another great commotion at the door, and four-and-twenty\ngood bowmen came marching in with Will Stutely at their head. And they\nseized the ten liveried archers and the bride's scowling brother and the\nother men on guard and bound them prisoners.\n\nThen in came Allan-a-Dale, decked out gaily, with Will Scarlet for best\nman. And they walked gravely down the aisle and stood over against the\nchancel.\n\n\"Before a maiden weds she chooses--an the laws of good King Harry be\njust ones,\" said Robin. \"Now, maiden, before this wedding continues,\nwhom will you have to husband?\"\n\nThe maiden answered not in words, but smiled with a glad light in her\neyes, and walked over to Allan and clasped her arms about his neck.\n\n\"That is her true love,\" said Robin. \"Young Allan instead of the gouty\nknight. And the true lovers shall be married at this time before we\ndepart away. Now my lord Bishop, proceed with the ceremony!\"\n\n\"Nay, that shall not be,\" protested the Bishop; \"the banns must be cried\nthree times in the church. Such is the law of our land.\"\n\n\"Come here, Little John,\" called Robin impatiently; and plucked off the\nBishop's frock from his back and put it on the yeoman.\n\nNow the Bishop was short and fat, and Little John was long and lean.\nThe gown hung loosely over Little John's shoulders and came only to\nhis waist. He was a fine comical sight, and the people began to laugh\nconsumedly at him.\n\n\"By the faith o' my body,\" said Robin, \"this cloth makes you a man.\nYou're the finest Bishop that ever I saw in my life. Now cry the banns.\"\n\nSo Little John clambered awkwardly into the quire, his short gown\nfluttering gaily; and he called the banns for the marriage of the maid\nand Allan-a-Dale once, twice, and thrice.\n\n\"That's not enough,\" said Robin; \"your gown is so short that you must\ntalk longer.\"\n\nThen Little John asked them in the church four, five, six, and seven\ntimes.\n\n\"Good enough!\" said Robin. \"Now belike I see a worthy friar in the back\nof this church who can say a better service than ever my lord Bishop of\nHereford. My lord Bishop shall be witness and seal the papers, but do\nyou, good friar, bless this pair with book and candle.\"\n\nSo Friar Tuck, who all along had been back in one corner of the church,\ncame forward; and Allan and his maid kneeled before him, while the old\nknight, held an unwilling witness, gnashed his teeth in impotent rage;\nand the friar began with the ceremony.\n\nWhen he asked, \"Who giveth this woman?\" Robin stepped up and answered in\na clear voice:\n\n\"I do! I, Robin Hood of Barnesdale and Sherwood! And he who takes her\nfrom Allan-a-Dale shall buy her full dearly.\"\n\nSo the twain were declared man and wife and duly blessed; and the bride\nwas kissed by each sturdy yeoman beginning with Robin Hood.\n\nNow I cannot end this jolly tale better than in the words of the ballad\nwhich came out of the happening and which has been sung in the villages\nand countryside ever since:\n\n     \"And thus having end of this merry wedding,\n     The bride lookt like a queen;\n     And so they returned to the merry greenwood\n     Amongst the leaves so green.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nHOW THE WIDOW'S THREE SONS WERE RESCUED\n\n     Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,\n     With a link a down and a down,\n     And there he met with the proud Sheriff,\n     Was walking along the town.\n\nThe wedding-party was a merry one that left Plympton Church, I ween; but\nnot so merry were the ones left behind. My lord Bishop of Hereford\nwas stuck up in the organ-loft and left, gownless and fuming. The ten\nliveried archers were variously disposed about the church to keep him\ncompany; two of them being locked in a tiny crypt, three in the belfry,\n\"to ring us a wedding peal,\" as Robin said; and the others under\nquire seats or in the vestry. The bride's brother at her entreaty was\nreleased, but bidden not to return to the church that day or interfere\nwith his sister again on pain of death. While the rusty old knight was\nforced to climb a high tree, where he sat insecurely perched among the\nbranches, feebly cursing the party as it departed.\n\nIt was then approaching sundown, but none of the retainers or villagers\ndared rescue the imprisoned ones that night, for fear of Robin Hood's\nmen. So it was not until sunup the next day, that they were released.\nThe Bishop and the old knight, stiff as they were, did not delay longer\nthan for breakfast, but so great was their rage and shame--made straight\nto Nottingham and levied the Sheriff's forces. The Sheriff himself was\nnot anxious to try conclusions again with Robin in the open. Perhaps he\nhad some slight scruples regarding his oath. But the others swore that\nthey would go straight to the King, if he did not help them, so he was\nfain to consent.\n\nA force of an hundred picked men from the Royal Foresters and swordsmen\nof the shire was gathered together and marched straightway into the\ngreenwood. There, as fortune would have it, they surprised some score of\noutlaws hunting, and instantly gave chase. But they could not surround\nthe outlaws, who kept well in the lead, ever and anon dropping behind\na log or boulder to speed back a shaft which meant mischief to the\npursuers. One shaft indeed carried off the Sheriff's hat and caused\nthat worthy man to fall forward upon his horse's neck from sheer terror;\nwhile five other arrows landed in the fleshy parts of Foresters' arms.\n\nBut the attacking party was not wholly unsuccessful. One outlaw in his\nflight stumbled and fell; when two others instantly stopped and helped\nto put him on his feet again. They were the widow's three sons, Stout\nWill, and Lester, and John. The pause was an unlucky one for them, as\na party of Sheriff's men got above them and cut them off from their\nfellows. Swordsmen came up in the rear, and they were soon hemmed in on\nevery side. But they gave good account of themselves, and before they\nhad been overborne by force of numbers they had killed two and disabled\nthree more.\n\nThe infuriated attackers were almost on the point of hewing the stout\noutlaws to pieces, when the Sheriff cried:\n\n\"Hold! Bind the villains! We will follow the law in this and take them\nto the town jail. But I promise ye the biggest public hanging that has\nbeen seen in this shire for many changes of the moon!\"\n\nSo they bound the widow's three sons and carried them back speedily to\nNottingham.\n\nNow Robin Hood had not chanced to be near the scene of the fight, or\nwith his men; so for a time he heard nothing of the happening.\n\nBut that evening while returning to the camp he was met by the widow\nherself, who came weeping along the way.\n\n\"What news, what news, good woman?\" said Robin hastily but courteously;\nfor he liked her well.\n\n\"God save ye, Master Robin!\" said the dame wildly. \"God keep ye from the\nfate that has met my three sons! The Sheriff has laid hands on them and\nthey are condemned to die.\"\n\n\"Now, by our Lady! That cuts me to the heart! Stout Will, and Lester,\nand merry John! The earliest friends I had in the band, and still among\nthe bravest! It must not be! When is this hanging set?\"\n\n\"Middle the tinker tells me that it is for tomorrow noon,\" replied the\ndame.\n\n\"By the truth o' my body,\" quoth Robin, \"you could not tell me in better\ntime. The memory of the old days when you freely bade me sup and dine\nwould spur me on, even if three of the bravest lads in all the shire\nwere not imperiled. Trust to me, good woman!\"\n\nThe old widow threw herself on the ground and embraced his knees.\n\n\"'Tis dire danger I am asking ye to face,\" she said weeping; \"and yet I\nknew your brave true heart would answer me. Heaven help ye, good Master\nRobin, to answer a poor widow's prayers!\"\n\nThen Robin Hood sped straightway to the forest-camp, where he heard the\ndetails of the skirmish--how that his men had been out-numbered five to\none, but got off safely, as they thought, until a count of their members\nhad shown the loss of the widow's three sons.\n\n\"We must rescue them, my men!\" quoth Robin, \"even from out the shadow of\nthe rope itself!\"\n\nWhereupon the band set to work to devise ways and means.\n\nRobin walked apart a little way with his head leaned thoughtfully upon\nhis breast--for he was sore troubled--when whom should he meet but an\nold begging palmer, one of a devout order which made pilgrimages and\nwandered from place to place, supported by charity.\n\nThis old fellow walked boldly up to Robin and asked alms of him; since\nRobin had been wont to aid members of his order.\n\n\"What news, what news, thou foolish old man?\" said Robin, \"what news, I\ndo thee pray?\"\n\n\"Three squires in Nottingham town,\" quoth the palmer, \"are condemned\nto die. Belike that is greater news than the shire has had in some\nSundays.\"\n\nThen Robin's long-sought idea came to him like a flash.\n\n\"Come, change thine apparel with me, old man,\" he said, \"and I'll give\nthee forty shillings in good silver to spend in beer or wine.\"\n\n\"O, thine apparel is good,\" the palmer protested, \"and mine is ragged\nand torn. The holy church teaches that thou should'st ne'er laugh an old\nman to scorn.\"\n\n\"I am in simple earnest, I say. Come, change thine apparel with mine.\nHere are twenty pieces of good broad gold to feast they brethren right\nroyally.\"\n\nSo the palmer was persuaded; and Robin put on the old man's hat, which\nstood full high in the crown; and his cloak, patched with black and\nblue and red, like Joseph's coat of many colors in its old age; and\nhis breeches, which had been sewed over with so many patterns that the\noriginal was scarce discernible; and his tattered hose; and his shoes,\ncobbled above and below. And while as he made the change in dress he\nmade so many whimsical comments also about a man's pride and the dress\nthat makes a man, that the palmer was like to choke with cackling\nlaughter.\n\nI warrant you, the two were comical sights when they parted company that\nday. Nathless, Robin's own mother would not have known him, had she been\nliving.\n\nThe next morning the whole town of Nottingham was early astir, and as\nsoon as the gates were open country-folk began to pour in; for a triple\nhanging was not held there every day in the week, and the bustle almost\nequated a Fair day.\n\nRobin Hood in his palmer's disguise was one of the first ones to enter\nthe gates, and he strolled up and down and around the town as though he\nhad never been there before in all his life. Presently he came to the\nmarket-place, and beheld thereon three gallows erected.\n\n\"Who are these builded for, my son?\" asked he of a rough soldier\nstanding by.\n\n\"For three of Robin Hood's men,\" answered the other. \"And it were Robin\nhimself, 'twould be thrice as high I warrant ye. But Robin is too smart\nto get within the Sheriff's clutches again.\"\n\nThe palmer crossed himself.\n\n\"They say that he is a bold fellow,\" he whined.\n\n\"Ha!\" said the soldier, \"he may be bold enough out behind stumps i' the\nforest, but the open market-place is another matter.\"\n\n\"Who is to hang these three poor wretches?\" asked the palmer.\n\n\"That hath the Sheriff not decided. But here he comes now to answer his\nown questions.\" And the soldier came to stiff attention as the Sheriff\nand his body-guard stalked pompously up to inspect the gallows.\n\n\"O, Heaven save you, worshipful Sheriff!\" said the palmer. \"Heaven\nprotect you! What will you give a silly old man to-day to be your\nhangman?\"\n\n\"Who are you, fellow?\" asked the Sheriff sharply.\n\n\"Naught save a poor old palmer. But I can shrive their souls and hang\ntheir bodies most devoutly.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" replied the other. \"The fee to-day is thirteen pence; and\nI will add thereunto some suits of clothing for that ragged back of\nyours.\"\n\n\"God bless ye!\" said the palmer. And he went with the soldier to the\njail to prepare his three men for execution.\n\nJust before the stroke of noon the doors of the prison opened and the\nprocession of the condemned came forth. Down through the long lines of\npacked people they walked to the market-place, the palmer in the lead,\nand the widow's three sons marching firmly erect between soldiers.\n\nAt the gallows foot they halted. The palmer whispered to them, as though\noffering last words of consolation; and the three men, with arms bound\ntightly behind their backs, ascended the scaffold, followed by their\nconfessor.\n\nThen Robin stepped to the edge of the scaffold, while the people grew\nstill as death; for they desired to hear the last words uttered to the\nvictims. But Robin's voice did not quaver forth weakly, as formerly,\nand his figure had stiffened bolt upright beneath the black robe that\ncovered his rags.\n\n\"Hark ye, proud Sheriff!\" he cried. \"I was ne'er a hangman in all my\nlife, nor do I now intend to begin that trade. Accurst be he who first\nset the fashion of hanging! I have but three more words to say. Listen\nto them!\"\n\nAnd forth from the robe he drew his horn and blew three loud blasts\nthereon. Then his keen hunting-knife flew forth and in a trice, Stout\nWill, Lester, and merry John were free men and had sprung forward and\nseized the halberds from the nearest soldiers guarding the gallows.\n\n\"Seize them! 'Tis Robin Hood!\" screamed the Sheriff, \"an hundred pounds\nif ye hold them, dead or alive!\"\n\n\"I make it two hundred!\" roared the fat Bishop.\n\nBut their voices were drowned in the uproar that ensued immediately\nafter Robin blew his horn. He himself had drawn his sword and leaped\ndown the stairs from the scaffold, followed by his three men. The guard\nhad closed around them in vain effort to disarm them, when \"A rescuer\"\nshouted Will Stutely's clear voice on one side of them, and \"A\nrescue!\" bellowed Little John's on the other; and down through the\nterror-stricken crowd rushed fourscore men in Lincoln green, their force\nseeming twice that number in the confusion. With swords drawn they fell\nupon the guard from every side at once. There was a brief clash of hot\nweapons, then the guard scattered wildly, and Robin Hood's men formed in\na compact mass around their leader and forced their way slowly down the\nmarket-place.\n\n\"Seize them! In the King's name!\" shrieked the Sheriff. \"Close the\ngates!\"\n\nIn truth, the peril would have been even greater, had this last order\nbeen carried out. But Will Scarlet and Allan-a-Dale had foreseen that\nevent, and had already overpowered the two warders.\n\nSo the gates stood wide open, and toward them the band of outlaws\nheaded.\n\nThe soldiers rallied a force of twice their number and tried resolutely\nto pierce their center. But the retreating force turned thrice and sent\nsuch volleys of keen arrows from their good yew bows, that they kept a\ndistance between the two forces.\n\nAnd thus the gate was reached, and the long road leading up the hill,\nand at last the protecting greenwood itself. The soldiers dared come no\nfarther. And the widow's three sons, I warrant you, supped more heartily\nthat night than ever before in their whole lives.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHOW A BEGGAR FILLED THE PUBLIC EYE\n\n     Good Robin accost him in his way,\n     To see what he might be;\n     If any beggar had money,\n     He thought some part had he.\n\nOne bright morning, soon after the stirring events told in the last\nchapter, Robin wandered forth alone down the road to Barnesdale, to see\nif aught had come of the Sheriff's pursuit. But all was still and\nserene and peaceful. No one was in sight save a solitary beggar who came\nsturdily along his way in Robin's direction. The beggar caught sight\nof Robin, at the same moment, as he emerged from the trees, but gave no\nsign of having seen him. He neither slackened nor quickened his pace,\nbut jogged forward merrily, whistling as he came, and beating time by\npunching holes in the dusty road with the stout pike-staff in his hand.\n\nThe curious look of the fellow arrested Robin's attention, and he\ndecided to stop and talk with him. The fellow was bare-legged and\nbare-armed, and wore a long shift of a shirt, fastened with a belt.\nAbout his neck hung a stout, bulging bag, which was buckled by a good\npiece of leather thong.\n\n     He had three hats upon his head,\n     Together sticked fast,\n     He cared neither for the wind nor wet,\n     In lands where'er he past.\n\nThe fellow looked so fat and hearty, and the wallet on his shoulder\nseemed so well filled, that Robin thought within himself,\n\n\"Ha! this is a lucky beggar for me! If any of them have money, this is\nthe chap, and, marry, he should share it with us poorer bodies.\"\n\nSo he flourished his own stick and planted himself in the traveler's\npath.\n\n\"Sirrah, fellow!\" quoth he; \"whither away so fast? Tarry, for I would\nhave speech with ye!\"\n\nThe beggar made as though he heard him not, and kept straight on with\nhis faring.\n\n\"Tarry, I say, fellow!\" said Robin again; \"for there's a way to make\nfolks obey!\"\n\n\"Nay, 'tis not so,\" answered the beggar, speaking for the first time; \"I\nobey no man in all England, not even the King himself. So let me pass on\nmy way, for 'tis growing late, and I have still far to go before I can\ncare for my stomach's good.\"\n\n\"Now, by my troth,\" said Robin, once more getting in front of the other,\n\"I see well by your fat countenance, that you lack not for good food,\nwhile I go hungry. Therefore you must lend me of your means till we meet\nagain, so that I may hie to the nearest tavern.\"\n\n\"I have no money to lend,\" said the beggar crossly. \"Methinks you are as\nyoung a man as I, and as well able to earn a supper. So go your way, and\nI'll go mine. If you fast till you get aught out of me, you'll go hungry\nfor the next twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"Not while I have a stout stick to thwack your saucy bones!\" cried\nRobin. \"Stand and deliver, I say, or I'll dust your shirt for you; and\nif that will not teach you manners, then we'll see what a broad arrow\ncan do with a beggar's skin!\"\n\nThe beggar smiled, and answered boast with boast. \"Come on with your\nstaff, fellow! I care no more for it than for a pudding stick. And as\nfor your pretty bow--_that_ for it!\"\n\nAnd with amazing quickness, he swung his pike-staff around and knocked\nRobin's bow clean out of his hand, so that his fingers smarted with\npain. Robin danced and tried to bring his own staff into action; but\nthe beggar never gave him a chance. Biff! whack! came the pike-staff,\nsmiting him soundly and beating down his guard.\n\nThere were but two things to do; either stand there and take a sound\ndrubbing, or beat a hasty retreat. Robin chose the latter--as you or I\nwould probably have done--and scurried back into the wood, blowing his\nhorn as he went.\n\n\"Fie, for shame, man!\" jeered the bold beggar after him. \"What is your\nhaste? We had but just begun. Stay and take your money, else you will\nnever be able to pay your reckoning at the tavern!\"\n\nBut Robin answered him never a word. He fled up hill and down dale till\nhe met three of his men who were running up in answer to his summons.\n\n\"What is wrong?\" they asked.\n\n\"'Tis a saucy beggar,\" said Robin, catching his breath. \"He is back\nthere on the highroad with the hardest stick I've met in a good many\ndays. He gave me no chance to reason with him, the dirty scamp!\"\n\nThe men--Much and two of the widow's sons--could scarce conceal their\nmirth at the thought of Robin Hood running from a beggar. Nathless, they\nkept grave faces, and asked their leader if he was hurt.\n\n\"Nay,\" he replied, \"but I shall speedily feel better if you will fetch\nme that same beggar and let me have a fair chance at him.\"\n\nSo the three yeomen made haste and came out upon the highroad and\nfollowed after the beggar, who was going smoothly along his way again,\nas though he were at peace with all the world.\n\n\"The easiest way to settle this beggar,\" said Much, \"is to surprise\nhim. Let us cut through yon neck of woods and come upon him before he is\naware.\"\n\nThe others agreed to this, and the three were soon close upon their\nprey.\n\n\"Now!\" quoth Much; and the other two sprang quickly upon the beggar's\nback and wrested his pike-staff from his hand. At the same moment Much\ndrew his dagger and flashed it before the fellow's breast.\n\n\"Yield you, my man!\" cried he; \"for a friend of ours awaits you in the\nwood, to teach you how to fight properly.\"\n\n\"Give me a fair chance,\" said the beggar valiantly, \"and I'll fight you\nall at once.\"\n\nBut they would not listen to him. Instead, they turned him about and\nbegan to march him toward the forest. Seeing that it was useless to\nstruggle, the beggar began to parley.\n\n\"Good my masters,\" quoth he, \"why use this violence? I will go with ye\nsafe and quietly, if ye insist, but if ye will set me free I'll make\nit worth your while. I've a hundred pounds in my bag here. Let me go my\nway, and ye shall have all that's in the bag.\"\n\nThe three outlaws took council together at this.\n\n\"What say you?\" asked Much of the others. \"Our master will be more glad\nto see this beggar's wallet than his sorry face.\"\n\nThe other two agreed, and the little party came to a halt and loosed\nhold of the beggar.\n\n\"Count out your gold speedily, friend,\" said Much. There was a brisk\nwind blowing, and the beggar turned about to face it, directly they had\nunhanded him.\n\n\"It shall be done, gossips,\" said he. \"One of you lend me your cloak and\nwe will spread it upon the ground and put the wealth upon it.\"\n\nThe cloak was handed him, and he placed his wallet upon it as though\nit were very heavy indeed. Then he crouched down and fumbled with\nthe leather fastenings. The outlaws also bent over and watched the\nproceeding closely, lest he should hide some of the money on his person.\nPresently he got the bag unfastened and plunged his hands into it. Forth\nfrom it he drew--not shining gold--but handfuls of fine meal which he\ndashed into the eager faces of the men around him. The wind aided him\nin this, and soon there arose a blinding cloud which filled the eyes,\nnoses, and mouths of the three outlaws till they could scarcely see or\nbreathe.\n\nWhile they gasped and choked and sputtered and felt around wildly for\nthat rogue of a beggar, he finished the job by picking up the cloak\nby its corners and shaking it vigorously in the faces of his suffering\nvictims. Then he seized a stick which lay conveniently near, and began\nto rain blows down upon their heads, shoulders, and sides, all the time\ndancing first on one leg, then on the other, and crying,\n\n\"Villains! rascals! here are the hundred pounds I promised. How do you\nlike them? I' faith, you'll get all that's in the bag.\"\n\nWhack! whack! whack! whack! went the stick, emphasizing each word. Howls\nof pain might have gone up from the sufferers, but they had too much\nmeal in their throats for that. Their one thought was to flee, and they\nstumbled off blindly down the road, the beggar following them a little\nway to give them a few parting love-taps.\n\n\"Fare ye well, my masters,\" he said finally turning the other way; \"and\nwhen next I come along the Barnesdale road, I hope you will be able to\ntell gold from meal dust!\"\n\nWith this he departed, an easy victor, and again went whistling on his\nway, while the three outlaws rubbed the meal out of their eyes and began\nto catch their breath again.\n\nAs soon as they could look around them clearly, they beheld Robin\nHood leaning against a tree trunk and surveying them smilingly. He had\nrecovered his own spirits in full measure, on seeing their plight.\n\n\"God save ye, gossips!\" he said, \"ye must, in sooth, have gone the wrong\nway and been to the mill, from the looks of your clothes.\"\n\nThen when they looked shamefaced and answered never a word, he went on,\nin a soft voice,\n\n\"Did ye see aught of that bold beggar I sent you for, lately?\"\n\n\"In sooth, master,\" responded Much the miller's son, \"we heard more of\nhim than we saw him. He filled us so full of meal that I shall sweat\nmeal for a week. I was born in a mill, and had the smell of meal in my\nnostrils from my very birth, you might say, and yet never before did I\nsee such a quantity of the stuff in so small space.\"\n\nAnd he sneezed violently.\n\n\"How was that?\" asked Robin demurely.\n\n\"Why we laid hold of the beggar, as you did order, when he offered to\npay for his release out of the bag he carried upon his back.\"\n\n\"The same I coveted,\" quoth Robin as if to himself.\n\n\"So we agreed to this,\" went on Much, \"and spread a cloak down, and he\nopened his bag and shook it thereon. Instantly a great cloud of meal\nfilled the air, whereby we could neither see nor breathe; and in the\nmidst of this cloud he vanished like a wizard.\"\n\n\"But not before he left certain black and blue spots, to be remembered\nby, I see,\" commented Robin.\n\n\"He was in league with the evil one,\" said one of the widow's sons,\nrubbing himself ruefully.\n\nThen Robin laughed outright, and sat him down upon the gnarled root of a\ntree, to finish his merriment.\n\n\"Four bold outlaws, put to rout by a sorry beggar!\" cried he. \"I can\nlaugh at ye, my men, for I am in the same boat with ye. But 'twould\nnever do to have this tale get abroad--even in the greenwood--how that\nwe could not hold our own with the odds in our favor. So let us have\nthis little laugh all to ourselves, and no one else need be the wiser!\"\n\nThe others saw the point of this, and felt better directly, despite\ntheir itching desire to get hold of the beggar again. And none of the\nfour ever told of the adventure.\n\nBut the beggar must have boasted of it at the next tavern; or a little\nbird perched among the branches of a neighboring oak must have sung\nof it. For it got abroad, as such tales will, and was put into a right\ndroll ballad which, I warrant you, the four outlaws did not like to\nhear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD FOUGHT GUY OF GISBORNE\n\n     \"I dwell by dale and down,\" quoth he,\n     \"And Robin to take I'm sworn;\n     And when I am called by my right name,\n     I am Guy of good Gisborne.\"\n\nSome weeks passed after the rescue of the widow's three sons; weeks\nspent by the Sheriff in the vain effort to entrap Robin Hood and his\nmen. For Robin's name and deeds had come to the King's ears, in London\ntown, and he sent word to the Sheriff to capture the outlaw, under\npenalty of losing his office. So the Sheriff tried every manner of means\nto surprise Robin Hood in the forest, but always without success. And he\nincreased the price put upon Robin's head, in the hope that the best men\nof the kingdom could be induced to try their skill at a capture.\n\nNow there was a certain Guy of Gisborne, a hireling knight of the King's\narmy, who heard of Robin and of the price upon his head. Sir Guy was one\nof the best men at the bow and the sword in all the King's service.\nBut his heart was black and treacherous. He obtained the King's leave\nforthwith to seek out the forester; and armed with the King's scroll he\ncame before the Sheriff at Nottingham.\n\n\"I have come to capture Robin Hood,\" quoth he, \"and mean to have him,\ndead or alive.\"\n\n\"Right gladly would I aid you,\" answered the Sheriff, \"even if the\nKing's seal were not sufficient warrant. How many men need you?\"\n\n\"None,\" replied Sir Guy, \"for I am convinced that forces of men can\nnever come at the bold robber. I must needs go alone. But do you hold\nyour men in readiness at Barnesdale, and when you hear a blast from this\nsilver bugle, come quickly, for I shall have the sly Robin within my\nclutches.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the Sheriff. \"Marry, it shall be done.\" And he set\nabout giving orders, while Guy of Gisborne sallied forth disguised.\n\nNow as luck would have it, Will Scarlet and Little John had gone to\nBarnesdale that very day to buy suits of Lincoln green for certain of\nthe yeomen who had come out at the knees and elbows. But not deeming it\nbest for both of them to run their necks into a noose, together, they\nparted just outside the town, and Will went within the gates, while John\ntarried and watched at the brow of the hill on the outside.\n\nPresently whom should he see but this same Will flying madly forth from\nthe gates again, closely pursued by the Sheriff and threescore men. Over\nthe moat Will sprang, through the bushes and briars, across the swamp,\nover stocks and stones, up the woodland roads in long leaps like a\nscared jack rabbit. And after him puffed the Sheriff and his men, their\nforce scattering out in the flight as one man would tumble head-first\ninto a ditch, another mire up in the swamp, another trip over a rolling\nstone, and still others sit down on the roadside and gasp for wind like\nfish out of water.\n\nLittle John could not forbear laughing heartily at the scene, though\nhe knew that 'twould be anything but a laughing matter if Will should\nstumble. And in truth one man was like to come upon him. It was\nWilliam-a-Trent, the best runner among the Sheriff's men. He had come\nwithin twenty feet of Scarlet and was leaping upon him with long bounds\nlike a greyhound, when John rose up quickly, drew his bow and let fly\none of his fatal shafts. It would have been better for William-a-Trent\nto have been abed with sorrow--says the ballad--than to be that day in\nthe greenwood slade to meet with Little John's arrow. He had run his\nlast race.\n\nThe others halted a moment in consternation, when the shaft came\nhurtling down from the hill; but looking up they beheld none save Little\nJohn, and with a cry of fierce joy they turned upon him. Meanwhile Will\nScarlet had reached the brow of the hill and sped down the other side.\n\n\"I'll just send one more little message of regret to the Sheriff,\" said\nLittle John, \"before I join Will.\"\n\nBut this foolhardy deed was his undoing, for just as the arrow left the\nstring, the good yew bow that had never before failed him snapped in\ntwain.\n\n\"Woe worth, woe worth thee, wicked wood, that ere thou grew on a\ntree!\" cursed Little John, and planted his feet resolutely in the earth\nresolved to sell the path dearly; for the soldiers were now so close\nupon him that he dared not turn.\n\nAnd a right good account of himself he gave that day, dealing with\neach man as he came up according to his merit. And so winded were the\npursuers when they reached the top of the hill that he laid out the\nfirst ten of them right and left with huge blows of his brawny fist.\n\nBut if five men can do more than three, a score can overcome one.\n\nA body of archers stood off at a prudent distance and covered Little\nJohn with their arrows.\n\n\"Now yield you!\" panted the Sheriff. \"Yield you, Little John, or Reynold\nGreenleaf, or whatever else name you carry this day! Yield you, or some\nfew of these shafts will reach your heart!\"\n\n\"Marry, my heart has been touched by your words ere now,\" said Little\nJohn; \"and I yield me.\"\n\nSo the Sheriff's men laid hold of Little John and bound him fast with\nmany cords, so fearful were they lest he should escape. And the Sheriff\nlaughed aloud in glee, and thought of how he should avenge his stolen\nplate, and determined to make a good day's work of it.\n\n\"By the Saints!\" he said, \"you shall be drawn by dale and down, and\nhanged high on a hill in Barnesdale this very day.\"\n\n\"Hang and be hanged!\" retorted the prisoner. \"You may fail of your\npurpose if it be Heaven's will.\"\n\nBack down the hill and across the moor went the company speedily, for\nthey feared a rescue. And as they went the stragglers joined them. Here\na man got up feebly out of the ditch and rubbed his pate and fell in\nlike a chicken with the pip going for its dinner. Yonder came hobbling\na man with a lame ankle, or another with his shins torn by the briars or\nanother with his jacket all muddy from the marsh. So in truth it was\na tatterdemalion crew that limped and straggled and wandered back into\nBarnesdale that day. Yet all were merry, for the Sheriff had promised\nthem flagons of wine, and moreover they were to hang speedily the\nboldest outlaw in England, next to Robin Hood himself.\n\nThe gallows was quickly put up and a new rope provided.\n\n\"Now up with you!\" commanded the Sheriff, \"and let us see if your\ngreenwood tricks will avail you to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I would that I had bold Robin's horn,\" muttered poor John; \"methinks\n'tis all up with me even as the Sheriff hath spoken.\"\n\nIn good sooth the time was dire and pressing. The rope was placed around\nthe prisoner's neck and the men prepared to haul away.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" called the Sheriff. \"One--two--\"\n\nBut before the \"three\" left his lips the faint sound of a silver bugle\ncame floating over the hill.\n\n\"By my troth, that is Sir Guy of Gisborne's horn,\" quoth the Sheriff;\n\"and he bade me not to delay answering its summons. He has caught Robin\nHood.\"\n\n\"Pardon, Excellency,\" said one of his men; \"but if he has caught Robin\nHood, this is a merry day indeed. And let us save this fellow and build\nanother gallows and hang them both together.\"\n\n\"That's a brave thought!\" said the Sheriff slapping his knee. \"Take the\nrascal down and bind him fast to the gallows-tree against our return.\"\n\nSo Little John was made fast to the gallows-tree, while the Sheriff and\nall his men who could march or hobble went out to get Robin Hood and\nbring him in for the double hanging.\n\nLet us leave talking of Little John and the Sheriff, and see what has\nbecome of Robin Hood.\n\nIn the first place, he and Little John had come near having a quarrel\nthat self-same morning because both had seen a curious looking yeoman,\nand each wanted to challenge him singly. But Robin would not give way to\nhis lieutenant, and that is why John, in a huff, had gone with Will to\nBarnesdale.\n\nMeanwhile Robin approached the curious looking stranger. He seemed to be\na three-legged creature at first sight, but on coming nearer you would\nhave seen that 'twas really naught but a poorly clad man, who for a\nfreak had covered up his rags with a capul-hide, nothing more nor less\nthan the sun-dried skin of a horse, complete with head, tail, and mane.\nThe skin of the head made a helmet; while the tail gave the curious\nthree-legged appearance.\n\n\"Good-morrow, good fellow,\" said Robin cheerily, \"methinks by the bow\nyou bear in your hand that you should be a good archer.\"\n\n\"Indifferent good,\" said the other returning his greeting; \"but 'tis not\nof archery that I am thinking this morning, for I have lost my way and\nwould fain find it again.\"\n\n\"By my faith, I could have believed 'twas your wits you'd lost!\" thought\nRobin smiling. Then aloud: \"I'll lead you through the wood,\" quoth\nhe, \"an you will tell me your business. For belike your speech is much\ngentler than your attire.\"\n\n\"Who are you to ask me my business?\" asked the other roughly.\n\n\"I am one of the King's Rangers,\" replied Robin, \"set here to guard his\ndeer against curious looking strollers.\"\n\n\"Curious looking I may be,\" returned the other, \"but no stroller. Hark\nye, since you are a Ranger, I must e'en demand your service. I am on the\nKing's business and seek an outlaw. Men call him Robin Hood. Are you one\nof his men?\"--eyeing him keenly.\n\n\"Nay, God forbid!\" said Robin; \"but what want you with him?\"\n\n\"That is another tale. But I'd rather meet with that proud outlaw than\nforty good pounds of the King's money.\"\n\nRobin now saw how the land lay.\n\n\"Come with me, good yeoman,\" said he, \"and belike, a little later in the\nday, I can show you Robin's haunts when he is at home. Meanwhile let us\nhave some pastime under the greenwood tree. Let us first try the mastery\nat shooting arrows.\"\n\nThe other agreed, and they cut down two willow wands of a summer's\ngrowth that grew beneath a brier, and set them up at a distance of\nthreescore yards.\n\n\"Lead on, good fellow,\" quoth Robin. \"The first shot to you.\"\n\n\"Nay, by my faith,\" said the other, \"I will follow your lead.\"\n\nSo Robin stepped forth and bent his bow carelessly and sent his\nshaft whizzing toward the wand, missing it by a scant inch. He of the\nhorse-hide followed with more care yet was a good three-fingers' breadth\naway. On the second round, the stranger led off and landed cleverly\nwithin the small garland at the top of the wand; but Robin shot far\nbetter and clave the wand itself, clean at the middle.\n\n\"A blessing on your heart!\" shouted Capul-Hide; \"never saw I such\nshooting as that! Belike you are better than Robin Hood himself. But you\nhave not yet told me your name.\"\n\n\"Nay, by my faith,\" quoth Robin, \"I must keep it secret till you have\ntold me your own.\"\n\n\"I do not disdain to tell it,\" said the other. \"I dwell by dale and\ndown, and to take bold Robin am I sworn. This would I tell him to his\nface, were he not so great a craven. When I am called by my right name,\nI am Guy of Gisborne.\"\n\nThis he said with a great show of pride, and he strutted back and forth,\nforgetful that he had just been beaten at archery.\n\nRobin eyed him quietly. \"Methinks I have heard of you elsewhere. Do you\nnot bring men to the gallows for a living?\"\n\n\"Aye, but only outlaws such as Robin Hood.\"\n\n\"But pray what harm has Robin Hood done you?\"\n\n\"He is a highway robber,\" said Sir Guy, evading the question.\n\n\"Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the\npoor? Does he not protect the women and children and side with weak and\nhelpless? Is not his greatest crime the shooting of a few King's deer?\"\n\n\"Have done with your sophistry,\" said Sir Guy impatiently. \"I am more\nthan ever of opinion that you are one of Robin's men yourself.\"\n\n\"I have told you I am not,\" quoth Robin briefly. \"But if I am to help\nyou catch him, what is your plan?\"\n\n\"Do you see this silver bugle?\" said the other. \"A long blast upon it\nwill summon the Sheriff and all his men, when once I have Robin within\nmy grasp. And if you show him to me, I'll give you the half of my forty\npounds reward.\"\n\n\"I would not help hang a man for ten times forty pounds,\" said the\noutlaw. \"Yet will I point out Robin to you for the reward I find at my\nsword's point. I myself am Robin Hood of Sherwood and Barnesdale.\"\n\n\"Then have at you!\" cried the other springing swiftly into action. His\nsword leaped forth from beneath the horse's hide with the speed born of\nlong practice, and before Robin had come to guard, the other had smitten\nat him full and foul. Robin eluded the lunge and drew his own weapon.\n\n\"A scurvy trick!\" quoth he grimly, \"to strike at a man unprepared.\"\n\nThen neither spoke more, but fell sternly to work--lunge and thrust and\nward and parry--for two full hours the weapons smote together sullenly,\nand neither Robin Hood nor Sir Guy would yield an inch. I promise you\nthat if you could have looked forth on the fight from behind the trunk\nof some friendly tree, you would have seen deadly sport such as few\nmen beheld in Sherwood Forest. For the fighters glared sullenly at each\nother, the fires of hatred burning in their eyes. One was fighting for\nhis life; the other for a reward and the King's favor.\n\nStill circled the bright blades swiftly in the air--now gleaming in the\npeaceful sunlight--again hissing like maddened serpents. Neither had yet\ntouched the other, until Robin, in an unlucky moment, stumbled over\nthe projecting root of a tree; when Sir Guy, instead of giving him the\nchance to recover himself, as any courteous knight would have done,\nstruck quickly at the falling man and wounded him in the left side.\n\n\"Ah, dear Lady in Heaven,\" gasped Robin uttering his favorite prayer,\n\"shield me now! 'Twas never a man's destiny to die before his day.\"\n\nAnd adroitly he sprang up again, and came straight at the other with an\nawkward but unexpected stroke. The knight had raised his weapon high to\ngive a final blow, when Robin reached beneath and across his guard.\nOne swift lunge, and Sir Guy of Gisborne staggered backward with a deep\ngroan, Robin's sword through his throat.\n\nRobin looked at the slain man regretfully.\n\n\"You did bring it upon yourself,\" said he; \"and traitor and hireling\nthough you were, I would not willingly have killed you.\"\n\nHe looked to his own wound. It was not serious, and he soon staunched\nthe blood and bound up the cut. Then he dragged the dead body into the\nbushes, and took off the horse's hide and put it upon himself. He placed\nhis own cloak upon Sir Guy, and marked his face so none might tell who\nhad been slain. Robin's own figure and face were not unlike the other's.\n\nPulling the capul-hide well over himself, so that the helmet hid most\nof his face, Robin seized the silver bugle and blew a long blast. It was\nthe blast that saved the life of Little John, over in Barnesdale, for\nyou and I have already seen how it caused the fond Sheriff to prick up\nhis ears and stay the hanging, and go scurrying up over the hill and\ninto the wood with his men in search of another victim.\n\nIn five-and-twenty minutes up came running a score of the Sheriff's best\narchers.\n\n\"Did you signal us, lording?\" they asked, approaching Robin.\n\n\"Aye,\" said he, going to meet the puffing Sheriff.\n\n\"What news, what news, Sir Guy?\" said that officer.\n\n\"Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne had a fight; and he that wears Robin's\ncloak lies under the covert yonder.\"\n\n\"The best news I have heard in all my life!\" exclaimed the Sheriff\nrubbing his hands. \"I would that we could have saved him for the\nhanging--though I cannot now complain.\"\n\n\"The hanging?\" repeated Robin.\n\n\"Yes. This is our lucky day on the calendar. After you left me we\nnarrowly missed running one of the fellows--I believe 'twas Will\nScarlet--to earth; and another who came to his relief we were just about\nto hang, when your horn blew.\"\n\n\"Who was the other?\" asked the disguised outlaw.\n\n\"Whom do you suppose?\" laughed the Sheriff. \"The best man in the\ngreenwood, next to Robin Hood himself--Little John, Reynold Greenleaf!\"\nFor the Sheriff could not forget the name Little John had borne under\nhis own roof at Nottingham.\n\n\"Little John!\" thought Robin with a start. Verily that was a lucky\nblast of the bugle! \"But I see you have not escaped without a scratch,\"\ncontinued the Sheriff, becoming talkative through pure glee. \"Here, one\nof you men! Give Sir Guy of Gisborne your horse; while others of you\nbury that dog of an outlaw where he lies. And let us hasten back to\nBarnesdale and finish hanging the other.\"\n\nSo they put spurs to their horses, and as they rode Robin forced himself\nto talk merrily, while all the time he was planning the best way to\nsuccor Little John.\n\n\"A boon, Sheriff,\" he said as they reached the gates of the town.\n\n\"What is it, worthy sir? You have but to speak.\"\n\n\"I do not want any of your gold, for I have had a brave fight. But now\nthat I have slain the master, let me put an end to the man; so it shall\nbe said that Guy of Gisborne despatched the two greatest outlaws of\nEngland in one day.\"\n\n\"Have it as you will,\" said the Sheriff, \"but you should have asked a\nknight's fee and double your reward, and it would have been yours. It\nisn't every man that can take Robin Hood.\" \"No, Excellency,\" answered\nRobin. \"I say it without boasting, that no man took Robin Hood yesterday\nand none shall take him to-morrow.\"\n\nThen he approached Little John, who was still tied to the gallows-tree;\nand he said to the Sheriff's men, \"Now stand you back here till I see if\nthe prisoner has been shrived.\" And he stooped swiftly, and cut Little\nJohn's bonds, and thrust into his hands Sir Guy's bow and arrows, which\nhe had been careful to take.\n\n\"'Tis I, Robin!\" he whispered. But in truth, Little John knew it\nalready, and had decided there was to be no hanging that day.\n\nThen Robin blew three loud blasts upon his own horn, and drew forth his\nown bow; and before the astonished Sheriff and his men could come to\narms the arrows were whistling in their midst in no uncertain fashion.\n\nAnd look! Through the gates and over the walls came pouring another\nflight of arrows! Will Scarlet and Will Stutely had watched and planned\na rescue ever since the Sheriff and Robin rode back down the hill. Now\nin good time they came; and the Sheriff's demoralized force turned tail\nand ran, while Robin and Little John stood under the harmless gallows,\nand sped swift arrows after them, and laughed to see them go.\n\nThen they joined their comrades and hasted back to the good greenwood,\nand there rested. They had got enough sport for one day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nHOW MAID MARIAN CAME BACK TO SHERWOOD FOREST; ALSO, HOW ROBIN HOOD CAME\nBEFORE QUEEN ELEANOR.\n\n     But Robin Hood, he himself had disguis'd,\n     And Marian was strangely attir'd,\n     That they proved foes, and so fell to blows,\n     Whose valor bold Robin admir'd.\n\n     And when he came at London's court,\n     He fell down on his knee.\n     \"Thou art welcome, Lockesley,\" said the Queen,\n     \"And all thy good yeomandree.\"\n\nNow it fell out that one day not long thereafter, Robin was minded to\ntry his skill at hunting. And not knowing whom he might meet in his\nrambles, he stained his face and put on a sorry-looking jacket and a\nlong cloak before he sallied forth. As he walked, the peacefulness of\nthe morning came upon him, and brought back to his memory the early days\nso long ago when he had roamed these same glades with Marian. How sweet\nthey seemed to him now, and how far away! Marian, too, the dainty friend\nof his youth--would he ever see her again? He had thought of her very\noften of late, and each time with increasing desire to hear her clear\nvoice and musical laugh, and see her eyes light up at his coming.\n\nPerhaps the happiness of Allen-a-Dale and his lady had caused Robin's\nheart-strings to vibrate more strongly; perhaps, too, the coming of\nWill Scarlet. But, certes, Robin was anything but a hunter this bright\nmorning as he walked along with head drooping in a most love-lorn way.\n\nPresently a hart entered the glade in full view of him, grazing\npeacefully, and instantly the man of action awoke. His bow was drawn\nand a shaft all but loosed, when the beast fell suddenly, pierced by a\nclever arrow from the far side of the glade.\n\nThen a handsome little page sprang gleefully from the covert and ran\ntoward the dying animal. This was plainly the archer, for he flourished\nhis bow aloft, and likewise bore a sword at his side, though for all\nthat he looked a mere lad.\n\nRobin approached the hart from the other side.\n\n\"How dare you shoot the King's beasts, stripling?\" he asked severely.\n\n\"I have as much right to shoot them as the King himself,\" answered the\npage haughtily. \"How dare you question me?\"\n\nThe voice stirred Robin strongly. It seemed to chime into his memories\nof the old days. He looked at the page sharply, and the other returned\nthe glance, straight and unafraid.\n\n\"Who are you, my lad?\" Robin said more civilly.\n\n\"No lad of yours, and my name's my own,\" retorted the other with spirit.\n\n\"Softly! Fair and softly, sweet page, or we of the forest will have to\nteach you manners!\" said Robin.\n\n\"Not if _you_ stand for the forest!\" cried the page, whipping out his\nsword. \"Come, draw, and defend yourself!\"\n\nHe swung his blade valiantly; and Robin saw nothing for it but to draw\nlikewise. The page thereupon engaged him quite fiercely, and Robin found\nthat he had many pretty little tricks at fencing.\n\nNathless, Robin contented himself with parrying, and was loth to exert\nall his superior strength upon the lad. So the fight lasted for above a\nquarter of an hour, at the end of which time the page was almost spent\nand the hot blood flushed his cheeks in a most charming manner.\n\nThe outlaw saw his distress, and to end the fight allowed himself to be\npricked slightly on the wrist.\n\n\"Are you satisfied, fellow?\" asked the page, wincing a little at sight\nof the blood.\n\n\"Aye, honestly,\" replied Robin; \"and now perhaps you will grant me the\nhonor of knowing to whom I owe this scratch?\"\n\n\"I am Richard Partington, page to Her Majesty, Queen Eleanor,\" answered\nthe lad with dignity; and again the sound of his voice troubled Robin\nsorely.\n\n\"Why come you to the greenwood alone, Master Partington?\"\n\nThe lad considered his answer while wiping his sword with a small lace\nkerchief. The action brought a dim confused memory to Robin. The lad\nfinally looked him again in the eye.\n\n\"Forester, whether or no you be a King's man, know that I seek one Robin\nHood, an outlaw, to whom I bring amnesty from the Queen. Can you tell me\naught of him?\" And while awaiting his answer, he replaced the kerchief\nin his shirt. As he did so, the gleam of a golden trophy caught the\noutlaw's eye.\n\nRobin started forward with a joyful cry.\n\n\"Ah! I know you now! By the sight of yon golden arrow won at the\nSheriff's tourney, you are she on whom I bestowed it, and none other\nthan Maid Marian!\"\n\n\"You--are--?\" gasped Marian, for it was she; \"not Robin!\"\n\n\"Robin's self!\" said he gaily; and forthwith, clad as he was in rags,\nand stained of face, he clasped the dainty page close to his breast, and\nshe forsooth yielded right willingly.\n\n\"But Robin!\" she exclaimed presently, \"I knew you not, and was rude, and\nwounded you!\"\n\n\"'Twas nothing,\" he replied laughingly, \"so long as it brought me you.\"\n\nBut she made more ado over the sore wrist than Robin had received for\nall his former hurts put together. And she bound it with the little\nkerchief, and said, \"Now 'twill get well!\" and Robin was convinced she\nspoke the truth, for he never felt better in all his life. The whole\nwoods seemed tinged with a roseate hue, since Marian had come again.\n\nBut she, while happy also, was ill at ease; and Robin with a man's slow\ndiscernment at last saw that it was because of her boy's attire. He\nthought bluntly that there was naught to be ashamed of, yet smilingly\nhanded her his tattered long cloak, which she blushingly put on, and\nforthwith recovered her spirits directly.\n\nThen they began to talk of each other's varied fortunes, and of the many\nthings which had parted them; and so much did they find to tell that the\nsun had begun to decline well into the afternoon before they realized\nhow the hours sped.\n\n\"I am but a sorry host!\" exclaimed Robin, springing to his feet. \"I have\nnot once invited you to my wild roof.\"\n\n\"And I am but a sorry page,\" replied Marian; \"for I had clean forgot\nthat I was Richard Partington, and really did bring you a message from\nQueen Eleanor!\"\n\n\"Tell me on our way home, and there you shall be entrusted to Mistress\nDale. While the first of my men we meet will I send back for your deer.\"\n\nSo she told him, as they walked back through the glade, how that the\nfame of his prowess had reached Queen Eleanor's ears, in London town.\nAnd the Queen had said, \"Fain would I see this bold yeoman, and behold\nhis skill at the long-bow.\" And the Queen had promised him amnesty if\nhe and four of his archers would repair to London against the next\ntournament the week following, there to shoot against King Henry's\npicked men, of whom the King was right vain. All this Marian told in\ndetail, and added:\n\n\"When I heard Her Majesty say she desired to see you, I asked leave\nto go in search of you, saying I had known you once. And the Queen was\nright glad, and bade me go, and sent this gold ring to you from off her\nfinger, in token of her faith.\"\n\nThen Robin took the ring and bowed his head and kissed it loyally. \"By\nthis token will I go to London town,\" quoth he, \"and ere I part with\nthe Queen's pledge, may the hand that bears it be stricken off at the\nwrist!\" By this time they were come to the grove before the cave,\nand Robin presented Maid Marian to the band, who treated her with the\ngreatest respect. Will Scarlet was especially delighted to greet again\nhis old time friend, while Allan-a-Dale and his good wife bustled about\nto make her welcome in their tiny thatched cottage.\n\nThat evening after they had supped royally upon the very hart that\nMarian had slain, Allan sang sweet songs of Northern minstrelsy to the\nfair guest as she sat by Robin's side, the golden arrow gleaming in\nher dark hair. The others all joined in the chorus, from Will Scarlet's\nbaritone to Friar Tuck's heavy bass. Even Little John essayed to sing,\nalthough looked at threateningly by Much the miller's son.\n\nThen Robin bade Marian repeat her message from the Queen, which Marian\ndid in a way befitting the dignity of her royal mistress. After which\nthe yeomen gave three cheers for the Queen and three more for her page,\nand drank toasts to them both, rising to their feet.\n\n\"Ye have heard,\" quoth Robin standing forth, \"how that Her Majesty--whom\nGod preserve!--wishes but four men to go with me. Wherefore, I choose\nLittle John and Will Stutely, my two lieutenants, Will Scarlet, my\ncousin, and Allan-a-Dale, my minstrel. Mistress Dale, also, can go with\nher husband and be company for the Queen's page. We will depart with\nearly morning, decked in our finest. So stir ye, my lads! and see that\nnot only your tunics are fresh, but your swords bright and your bows\nand arrows fit. For we must be a credit to the Queen as well as the good\ngreenwood. You, Much, with Stout Will, Lester, and John, the widow's\nthree sons, shall have command of the band while we are away; and Friar\nTuck shall preside over the needs of your souls and stomachs.\"\n\nThe orders were received with shouts of approval, and toasts all around\nwere drunk again in nut-brown ale, ere the company dispersed to rest\nafter making ready for the journey.\n\nThe next morning was as fine a summer's day as ever you want to see, and\nthe green leaves of the forest made a pleasing background for the gay\npicture of the yeomen setting forth. Says the old ballad--it was a\nseemly sight to see how Robin Hood himself had dressed, and all his\nyeomanry. He clothed his men in Lincoln green, and himself in scarlet\nred, with hats of black and feathers white to bravely deck each head.\nNor were the two ladies behind-hand, I ween, at the bedecking.\n\nThus the chosen party of seven sallied forth being accompanied to the\nedge of the wood by the whole band, who gave them a merry parting and\nGodspeed!\n\nThe journey to London town was made without incident. The party\nproceeded boldly along the King's highroad, and no man met them who was\ndisposed to say them nay. Besides, the good Queen's warrant and ring\nwould have answered for them, as indeed it did at the gates of London.\nSo on they sped and in due course came to the palace itself and awaited\naudience with the Queen.\n\nNow the King had gone that day to Finsbury Field, where the tourney was\nsoon to be held, in order to look over the lists and see some of his\npicked men whom he expected to win against all comers. So much had he\nboasted of these men, that the Queen had secretly resolved to win a\nwager of him. She had heard of the fame of Robin Hood and his yeomen, as\nMarian had said; and Marian on her part had been overjoyed to be able to\nadd a word in their favor and to set out in search of them.\n\nTo-day the Queen sat in her private audience-room chatting pleasantly\nwith her ladies, when in came Mistress Marian Fitzwalter attired again\nas befitted her rank of lady-in-waiting. She courtesied low to the Queen\nand awaited permission to speak.\n\n\"How now!\" said the Queen smiling; \"is this my lady Marian, or the page,\nRichard Partington?\"\n\n\"Both, an it please Your Majesty. Richard found the man you sought,\nwhile Marian brought him to you.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Queen Eleanor eagerly.\n\n\"Awaiting your audience--he and four of his men, likewise a lady of\nwhose wooing and wedding I can tell you a pretty story at another time.\"\n\n\"Have them admitted.\"\n\nSo Marian gave orders to a herald, and presently Robin Hood and his\nlittle party entered the room.\n\nNow the Queen had half-expected the men to be rude and uncouth in\nappearance, because of their wild life in the forest; but she was\ndelightfully disappointed. Indeed she started back in surprise and\nalmost clapped her hands. For, sooth to say, the yeomen made a brave\nsight, and in all the court no more gallant men could be found. Marian\nfelt her cheeks glow with pride, at sight of the half-hidden looks of\nadmiration sent forth by the other ladies-in-waiting.\n\nRobin had not forgot the gentle arts taught by his mother, and he wore\nhis fine red velvet tunic and breeches with the grace of a courtier.\nWe have seen, before, what a dandified gentleman Will Scarlet was; and\nAllan-a-Dale, the minstrel, was scarcely less goodly to look upon.\nWhile the giant Little John and broad-shouldered Will Stutely made up in\nstature what little they lacked in outward polish. Mistress Dale, on her\npart, looked even more charming, if possible, than on the momentous day\nwhen she went to Plympton Church to marry one man and found another.\n\nThus came the people of the greenwood before Queen Eleanor, in her own\nprivate audience room. And Robin advanced and knelt down before her, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Here I am, Robin Hood--I and my chosen men! At Your Majesty's bidding\nam I come, bearing the ring of amnesty which I will protect--as I would\nprotect Your Majesty's honor--with my life!\"\n\n\"Thou art welcome, Lockesley,\" said the Queen smiling graciously.\n\n\"Thou art come in good time, thou and all thy brave yeomanry.\"\n\nThen Robin presented each of his men in turn, and each fell on his\nknee and was greeted with most kindly words. And the Queen kissed fair\nMistress Dale upon the cheek, and bade her remain in the palace with her\nladies while she was in the city. And she made all the party be seated\nto rest themselves after their long journey. Fine wines were brought,\nand cake, and rich food, for their refreshment. And as they ate and\ndrank, the Queen told them further of the tourney to be held at Finsbury\nField, and of how she desired them to wear her colors and shoot for her.\nMeantime, she concluded, they were to lie by quietly and be known of no\nman.\n\nTo do all this, Robin and his men pledged themselves full heartily. Then\nat the Queen's request, they related to her and her ladies some of their\nmerry adventures; whereat the listeners were vastly entertained, and\nlaughed heartily. Then Marian, who had heard of the wedding at Plympton\nChurch, told it so drolly that tears stood in the Queen's eyes from\nmerriment.\n\n\"My lord Bishop of Hereford!\" she said, \"'Twas indeed a comical business\nfor him! I shall keep that to twit his bones, I promise you! So this is\nour minstrel?\" she added presently, turning to Allan-a-Dale. \"Methinks I\nhave already heard of him. Will he not harp awhile for us to-day?\"\n\nAllan bowed low, and took a harp which was brought to him, and he\nthrummed the strings and sang full sweetly the border songs of the North\nCountree. And the Queen and all her ladies listened in rapt silence till\nall the songs were ended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nHOW THE OUTLAWS SHOT IN KING HARRY'S TOURNEY\n\n     The King is into Finsbury Field\n     Marching in battle 'ray,\n     And after follows bold Robin Hood,\n     And all his yeomen gay.\n\nThe morning of the great archery contest dawned fair and bright,\nbringing with it a fever of impatience to every citizen of London town,\nfrom the proudest courtier to the lowest kitchen wench. Aye, and all the\nsurrounding country was early awake, too, and began to wend their way to\nFinsbury Field, a fine broad stretch of practice ground near Moorfields.\nAround three sides of the Field were erected tier upon tier of seats,\nfor the spectators, with the royal boxes and booths for the nobility\nand gentry in the center. Down along one end were pitched gaily colored\ntents for the different bands of King's archers. There were ten of\nthese bands, each containing a score of men headed by a captain of great\nrenown; so to-day there were ten of the pavilions, each bearing aloft\nthe Royal Arms and vari-colored pennants which fluttered lightly in the\nfresh morning breeze.\n\nEach captain's flag was of peculiar color and device. First came the\nroyal purple streamer of Tepus, own bow-bearer to the King, and esteemed\nthe finest archer in all the land. Then came the yellow of Clifton of\nBuckinghamshire; and the blue of Gilbert of the White Hand--he who was\nrenowned in Nottinghamshire; and the green of Elwyn the Welshman; and\nthe White of Robert of Cloudesdale; and, after them, five other captains\nof bands, each a man of proved prowess. As the Queen had said aforetime,\nthe King was mightily proud of his archers, and now held this tourney to\nshow their skill and, mayhap, to recruit their forces.\n\nThe uprising tiers of seats filled early, upon this summer morning, and\nthe merry chatter of the people went abroad like the hum of bees in a\nhive. The royal party had not yet put in an appearance, nor were any\nof the King's archers visible. So the crowd was content to hide its\nimpatience by laughing jibes passed from one section to another, and\ncrying the colors of their favorite archers. In and out among the seats\nwent hawkers, their arms laden with small pennants to correspond with\nthe rival tents. Other vendors of pie and small cakes and cider also did\na thrifty business, for so eager had some of the people been to get good\nseats, that they had rushed away from home without their breakfast.\n\nSuddenly the gates at the far end, next the tents, opened wide, and a\ncourier in scarlet and gold, mounted upon a white horse, rode in\nblowing lustily upon the trumpet at his lips; and behind him came six\nstandard-bearers riding abreast. The populace arose with a mighty cheer.\nKing Harry had entered the arena. He bestrode a fine white charger\nand was clad in a rich dark suit of slashed velvet with satin and gold\nfacings. His hat bore a long curling ostrich plume of pure white and he\ndoffed it graciously in answer to the shouts of the people. By his\nside rode Queen Eleanor, looking regal and charming in her long brocade\nriding-habit; while immediately behind them came Prince Richard and\nPrince John, each attired in knightly coats of mail and helmets. Lords\nand ladies of the realm followed; and finally, the ten companies of\narchers, whose progress round the field was greeted with hardly less\napplause than that given the King himself.\n\nThe King and Queen dismounted from their steeds, ascended the steps\nof the royal box, and seated themselves upon two thrones, decked with\npurple and gold trapping, upon a dais sheltered by striped canvas. In\nthe booths at each side the members of the Court took their places;\nwhile comely pages ran hither and thither bearing the royal commands.\n'Twas a lordly sight, I ween, this shifting of proud courtiers, flashing\nof jeweled fans, and commingling of bright colors with costly gems!\n\nNow the herald arose to command peace, and soon the clear note of his\nbugle rose above the roar of the crowd and hushed it to silence. The\ntenscore archers ranged themselves in two long rows on each side of\nthe lists--a gallant array--while their captains, as a special mark of\nfavor, stood near the royal box.\n\n\"Come hither, Tepus,\" said the King to his bow-bearer. \"Come, measure me\nout this line, how long our mark must be.\"\n\n\"What is the reward?\" then asked the Queen.\n\n\"That will the herald presently proclaim,\" answered the King. \"For first\nprize we have offered a purse containing twoscore golden pounds; for\nsecond, a purse containing twoscore silver pennies; and for third a\nsilver bugle, inlaid with gold. Moreover, if the King's companies keep\nthese prizes, the winning companies shall have, first, two tuns of\nRhenish wine; second, two tuns of English beer; and, third, five of\nthe fattest harts that run on Dallom Lea. Methinks that is a princely\nwager,\" added King Harry laughingly.\n\nUp spake bold Clifton, secure in the King's favor. \"Measure no marks for\nus, most sovereign liege,\" quoth he; \"for such largess as that, we'll\nshoot at the sun and the moon.\"\n\n\"'Twill not be so far as that,\" said the King. \"But get a line of good\nlength, Tepus, and set up the targets at tenscore paces.\"\n\nForthwith, Tepus bowed low, and set up ten targets, each bearing the\npennant of a different company, while the herald stood forth again and\nproclaimed the rules and prizes. The entries were open to all comers.\nEach man, also, of the King's archers should shoot three arrows at the\ntarget bearing the colors of his band, until the best bowman in each\nband should be chosen. These ten chosen archers should then enter a\ncontest for an open target--three shots apiece--and here any other\nbowman whatsoever was asked to try his skill. The result at the open\ntargets should decide the tourney.\n\nThen all the people shouted again, in token that the terms of the\ncontest pleased them; and the archers waved their bows aloft, and\nwheeled into position facing their respective targets.\n\nThe shooting now began, upon all the targets at once, and the multitude\nhad so much ado to watch them, that they forgot to shout. Besides,\nsilence was commanded during the shooting. Of all the fine shooting that\nmorning, I have not now space to tell you. The full score of men shot\nthree times at each target, and then three times again to decide a tie.\nFor, more than once, the arrow shot by one man would be split wide\nopen by his successor. Every man's shaft bore his number to ease the\ncounting; and so close would they stick at the end of a round, that the\ntarget looked like a big bristle hairbrush. Then must the spectators\nrelieve their tense spirits by great cheering; while the King looked\nmighty proud of his skilled bowmen.\n\nAt last the company targets were decided, and Tepus, as was expected,\nled the score, having made six exact centers in succession. Gilbert\nof the White Hand followed with five, and Clifton with four. Two other\ncaptains had touched their center four times, but not roundly. While in\nthe other companies it so chanced that the captains had been out-shot by\nsome of the men under them.\n\nThe winners then saluted the King and Queen, and withdrew for a space to\nrest and renew their bow-strings for the keenest contest of all; while\nthe lists were cleared and a new target--the open one--was set up at\ntwelvescore paces. At the bidding of the King, the herald announced\nthat the open target was to be shot at, to decide the title of the best\narcher in all England; and any man there present was privileged to try\nfor it. But so keen had been the previous shooting, that many yeomen who\nhad come to enter the lists now would not do so; and only a dozen men\nstepped forth to give in their names.\n\n\"By my halidom!\" said the King, \"these must be hardy men to pit\nthemselves against my archers!\"\n\n\"Think you that your ten chosen fellows are the best bowmen in all\nEngland?\" asked the Queen.\n\n\"Aye, and in all the world beside,\" answered the King; \"and thereunto I\nwould stake five hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"I am minded to take your wager,\" said the Queen musingly, \"and will\ne'en do so if you grant me a boon.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the King.\n\n\"If I produce five archers who can out-shoot your ten, will you grant my\nmen full grace and amnesty?\"\n\n\"Assuredly!\" quoth the King in right good humor. \"Nathless, I tell you\nnow, your wager is in jeopardy, for there never were such bowmen as\nTepus and Clifton and Gilbert!\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said the Queen puckering her brow, still as though lost in\nthought. \"I must see if there be none present to aid me in my wager.\nBoy, call hither Sir Richard of the Lea and my lord Bishop of Hereford!\"\n\nThe two summoned ones, who had been witnessing the sport, came forward.\n\n\"Sir Richard,\" said she, \"thou art a full knight and good. Would'st\nadvise me to meet a wager of the King's, that I can produce other\narchers as good as Tepus and Gilbert and Clifton?\"\n\n\"Nay, Your Majesty,\" he said, bending his knee. \"There be none present\nthat can match them. Howbeit,\"--he added dropping his voice--\"I have\nheard of some who lie hid in Sherwood Forest who could show them strange\ntargets.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled and dismissed him.\n\n\"Come hither, my lord Bishop of Hereford,\" quoth she, \"would'st thou\nadvance a sum to support my wager 'gainst the King?\"\n\n\"Nay, Your Majesty,\" said the fat Bishop, \"an you pardon me, I'd not lay\ndown a penny on such a bet. For by my silver mitre, the King's archers\nare men who have no peers.\"\n\n\"But suppose I found men whom _thou knewest_ to be masters at the bow,\"\nshe insisted roguishly, \"would'st thou not back them? Belike, I have\nheard that there be men round about Nottingham and Plympton who carry\nsuch matters with a high hand!\"\n\nThe Bishop glanced nervously around, as if half expecting to see Robin\nHood's men standing near; then turned to find the Queen looking at him\nwith much amusement lurking in her eyes.\n\n\"Odds bodikins! The story of my misadventure must have preceded me!\" he\nthought, ruefully. Aloud he said, resolved to face it out,\n\n\"Your Majesty, such tales are idle and exaggerated. An you pardon me, I\nwould add to the King's wager that his men are invincible.\"\n\n\"As it pleases thee,\" replied the Queen imperturbably. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Here is my purse,\" said the Bishop uneasily. \"It contains fifteen score\nnobles, or near a hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"I'll take it at even money,\" she said, dismissing him; \"and Your\nMajesty\"--turning to the King who had been conversing with the two\nprinces and certain of the nobles--\"I accept your wager of five hundred\npounds.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the King, laughing as though it were a great jest.\n\"But what had minded you to take such interest in the sport, of a\nsudden?\"\n\n\"It is as I have said. I have found five men whom I will pit against any\nyou may produce.\"\n\n\"Then we will try their skill speedily,\" quoth the King. \"How say you,\nif first we decide this open target and then match the five best thereat\nagainst your unknown champions?\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said the Queen. Thereupon she signed to Maid Marian to\nstep forward, from a near-by booth where she sat with other\nladies-in-waiting, and whispered something in her ear. Marian courtesied\nand withdrew.\n\nNow the ten chosen archers from the King's bands came forth again and\ntook their stand; and with them stood forth the twelve untried men from\nthe open lists. Again the crowd was stilled, and every eye hung upon the\nspeeding of the shafts. Slowly but skilfully each man shot, and as\nhis shaft struck within the inner ring a deep breath broke from the\nmultitude like the sound of the wind upon the seashore. And now Gilbert\nof the White Hand led the shooting, and 'twas only by the space of a\nhairsbreadth upon the line that Tepus tied his score. Stout Elwyn, the\nWelshman, took third place; one of the private archers, named Geoffrey,\ncome fourth; while Clifton must needs content himself with fifth.\n\nThe men from the open lists shot fairly true, but nervousness and fear\nof ridicule wrought their undoing.\n\nThe herald then came forward again, and, instead of announcing the\nprize-winners, proclaimed that there was to be a final contest. Two\nmen had tied for first place, declared His Majesty the King, and three\nothers were entitled to honors. Now all these five were to shoot\nagain, and they were to be pitted against five other of the Queen's\nchoosing--men who had not yet shot upon that day.\n\nA thrill of astonishment and excitement swept around the arena. \"Who\nwere these men of the Queen's choosing?\" was upon every lip. The hubbub\nof eager voices grew intense; and in the midst of it all, the gate at\nthe far end of the field opened and five men entered and escorted a lady\nupon horseback across the arena to the royal box. The lady was instantly\nrecognized as Mistress Marian of the Queen's household, but no one\nseemed to know the faces of her escort. Four were clad in Lincoln green,\nwhile the fifth, who seemed to be the leader, was dressed in a brave\nsuit of scarlet red. Each man wore a close fitting cap of black, decked\nwith a curling white feather. For arms, they carried simply a stout bow,\na sheaf of new arrows, and a short hunting-knife.\n\nWhen the little party came before the dais on which the King and Queen\nsat, the yeomen doffed their caps humbly, while Maid Marian was assisted\nto dismount.\n\n\"Your Gracious Majesty,\" she said, addressing the Queen, \"these be the\nmen for whom you sent me, and who are now come to wear your colors and\nservice you in the tourney.\"\n\nThe Queen leaned forward and handed them each a scarf of green and gold.\n\n\"Lockesley,\" she said in a clear voice, \"I thank thee and thy men for\nthis service. Know that I have laid a wager with the King that ye can\noutshoot the best five whom he has found in all his bowmen.\" The five\nmen pressed the scarfs to their lips in token of fealty.\n\nThe King turned to the Queen inquiringly.\n\n\"Who are these men you have brought before us?\" asked he.\n\nUp came the worthy Bishop of Hereford, growing red and pale by turns.\n\n\"Your pardon, my liege lord!\" cried he; \"But I must denounce these\nfellows as outlaws. Yon man in scarlet is none other than Robin Hood\nhimself. The others are Little John and Will Stutely and Will Scarlet\nand Allan-a-Dale--all famous in the North Countree for their deeds of\nviolence.\"\n\n\"As my lord Bishop personally knows!\" added the Queen significantly.\n\nThe King's brows grew dark. The name of Robin Hood was well known to\nhim, as to every man there present.\n\n\"Is this true?\" he demanded sternly.\n\n\"Aye, my lord,\" responded the Queen demurely. \"But, bethink you--I have\nyour royal promise of grace and amnesty.\"\n\n\"That will I keep,\" said the King, holding in check his ire by a mighty\neffort. \"But, look you! Only forty days do I grant of respite. When this\ntime has elapsed, let these bold outlaws look to their safety!\"\n\nThen turning to his five victorious archers, who had drawn near, he\nadded, \"Ye have heard, my men, how that I have a wager with the Queen\nupon your prowess. Now here be men of her choosing--certain free shafts\nof Sherwood and Barnesdale. Wherefore look well to it, Gilbert and Tepus\nand Geoffrey and Elwyn and Clifton! If ye outshoot these knaves, I will\nfill your caps with silver pennies--aye, and knight the man who stands\nfirst. But if ye lose, I give the prizes, for which ye have just\nstriven, to Robin Hood and his men, according to my royal word.\"\n\n\"Robin Hood and his men!\" the saying flew round the arena with the speed\nof wild-fire, and every neck craned forward to see the famous fellows\nwho had dared to brave the King's anger, because of the Queen.\n\nAnother target was now set up, at the same distance as the last, and\nit was decided that the ten archers should shoot three arrows in turn.\nGilbert and Robin tossed up a penny for the lead, and it fell to the\nKing's men. So Clifton was bidden to shoot first.\n\nForth he stood, planting his feet firmly, and wetting his fingers before\nplucking the string. For he was resolved to better his losing score of\nthat day. And in truth he did so, for the shaft he loosed sped true, and\nlanded on the black bull's-eye, though not in the exact center. Again he\nshot, and again he hit the black, on the opposite rim. The third shaft\nswerved downward and came within the second ring, some two fingers'\nbreadths away. Nathless, a general cry went up, as this was the best\nshooting Clifton had done that day.\n\nWill Scarlet was chosen to follow him, and now took his place and\ncarefully chose three round and full-feathered arrows.\n\n\"Careful, my sweet coz!\" quoth Robin in a low tone. \"The knave has left\nwide space at the center for all of your darts.\"\n\nBut Robin gave Will the wrong caution, for over-much care spoiled\nhis aim. His first shaft flew wide and lodged in the second ring even\nfurther away than the worst shot of Clifton.\n\n\"Your pardon, coz!\" quoth Robin hastily. \"Bid care go to the bottom of\nthe sea, and do you loose your string before it sticks to your fingers!\"\n\nAnd Will profited by this hint, and loosed his next two shafts as\nfreely as though they flew along a Sherwood glade. Each struck upon the\nbull's-eye, and one even nearer the center than his rival's mark. Yet\nthe total score was adjudged in favor of Clifton. At this Will Scarlet\nbit his lip, but said no word, while the crowd shouted and waved yellow\nflags for very joy that the King's man had overcome the outlaw. They\nknew, also, that this demonstration would please the King.\n\nThe target was now cleared for the next two contestants--Geoffrey and\nAllan-a-Dale. Whereat, it was noticed that many ladies in the Queen's\nbooths boldly flaunted Allan's colors, much to the honest pride which\nglowed in the cheeks of one who sat in their midst.\n\n\"In good truth,\" said more than one lady to Mistress Dale, \"if thy\nhusband can handle the longbow as skilfully as the harp, his rival has\nlittle show of winning!\"\n\nThe saying augured well. Geoffrey had shot many good shafts that day;\nand indeed had risen from the ranks by virtue of them. But now each of\nhis three shots, though well placed in triangular fashion around the rim\nof the bull's-eye, yet allowed an easy space for Allan to graze within.\nHis shooting, moreover, was so prettily done, that he was right heartily\napplauded--the ladies and their gallants leading in the hand-clapping.\n\nNow you must know that there had long been a friendly rivalry in Robin\nHood's band as to who was the best shot, next after Robin himself. He\nand Will Stutely had lately decided their marksmanship, and Will had\nfound that Robin's skill was now so great as to place the leader at the\nhead of all good bowmen in the forest. But the second place lay between\nLittle John and Stutely, and neither wished to yield to the other. So\nto-day they looked narrowly at their leader to see who should shoot\nthird. Robin read their faces at a glance, and laughing merrily, broke\noff two straws and held them out.\n\n\"The long straw goes next!\" he decided; and it fell to Stutely.\n\nElwyn the Welshman was to precede him; and his score was no whit better\nthan Geoffrey's. But Stutely failed to profit by it. His besetting sin\nat archery had ever been an undue haste and carelessness. To-day these\nwere increased by a certain moodiness, that Little John had outranked\nhim. So his first two shafts flew swiftly, one after the other, to\nlodging places outside the Welshman's mark.\n\n\"Man! man!\" cried Robin entreatingly, \"you do forget the honor of the\nQueen, and the credit of Sherwood!\"\n\n\"I ask your pardon, master!\" quoth Will humbly enough, and loosing as he\nspoke his last shaft. It whistled down the course unerringly and struck\nin the exact center--the best shot yet made.\n\nNow some shouted for Stutely and some shouted for Elwyn; but Elwyn's\ntotal mark was declared the better. Whereupon the King turned to the\nQueen. \"What say you now?\" quoth he in some triumph. \"Two out of the\nthree first rounds have gone to my men. Your outlaws will have to shoot\nbetter than that in order to save your wager!\"\n\nThe Queen smiled gently.\n\n\"Yea, my lord,\" she said. \"But the twain who are left are able to do the\nshooting. You forget that I still have Little John and Robin Hood.\"\n\n\"And you forget, my lady, that I still have Tepus and Gilbert.\"\n\nSo each turned again to the lists and awaited the next rounds in silent\neagerness. I ween that King Harry had never watched the invasion of an\nenemy with more anxiety than he now felt.\n\nTepus was chosen to go next and he fell into the same error with Will\nScarlet. He held the string a moment too long, and both his first and\nsecond arrows came to grief. One of them, however, came within the black\nrim, and he followed it up by placing his third in the full center,\njust as Stutely had done in his last. These two centers were the fairest\nshots that had been made that day; and loud was the applause which\ngreeted this second one. But the shouting was as nothing to the uproar\nwhich followed Little John's shooting. That good-natured giant seemed\ndetermined to outdo Tepus by a tiny margin in each separate shot; for\nthe first and the second shafts grazed his rival's on the inner side,\nwhile for the third Little John did the old trick of the forest: he\nshot his own arrow in a graceful curve which descended from above upon\nTepus's final center shaft with a glancing blow that drove the other out\nand left the outlaw's in its place.\n\nThe King could scarce believe his eyes. \"By my halidom!\" quoth he, \"that\nfellow deserves either a dukedom or a hanging! He must be in league with\nSatan himself! Never saw I such shooting.\"\n\n\"The score is tied, my lord,\" said the Queen; \"we have still to see\nGilbert and Robin Hood.\"\n\nGilbert now took his stand and slowly shot his arrows, one after\nanother, into the bull's-eye. 'Twas the best shooting he had yet\ndone, but there was still the smallest of spaces left--if you looked\nclosely--at the very center.\n\n\"Well done, Gilbert!\" spoke up Robin Hood. \"You are a foeman worthy of\nbeing shot against.\" He took his own place as he spoke. \"Now if you had\nplaced one of your shafts _there_\"--loosing one of his own--\"and another\n_there_\"--out sped the second--\"and another _there_\"--the third was\nlaunched--\"mayhap the King would have declared you the best bowman in\nall England!\"\n\nBut the last part of his merry speech was drowned in the wild tumult\nof applause which followed his exploit. His first two shafts had packed\nthemselves into the small space left at the bull's-eye; while his third\nhad split down between them, taking half of each, and making all three\nappear from a distance, as one immense arrow.\n\nUp rose the King in amazement and anger.\n\n\"Gilbert is not yet beaten!\" he cried. \"Did he not shoot within the mark\nthrice? And that is allowed a best in all the rules of archery.\"\n\nRobin bowed low.\n\n\"As it please Your Majesty!\" quoth he. \"But may I be allowed to place\nthe mark for the second shooting?\"\n\nThe King waved his hand sullenly.. Thereupon Robin prepared another old\ntrick of the greenwood, and got him a light, peeled willow wand which he\nset in the ground in place of the target.\n\n\"There, friend Gilbert,\" called he gaily; \"belike you can hit that!\"\n\n\"I can scarce see it from here,\" said Gilbert, \"much less hit it.\nNathless, for the King's honor, I will try.\"\n\nBut this final shot proved his undoing, and his shaft flew harmlessly\nby the thin white streak. Then came Robin to his stand again, and picked\nhis arrow with exceeding care, and tried his string. Amid a breathless\npause he drew the good yew bow back to his ear, glanced along the shaft,\nand let the feathered missile fly. Straight it sped, singing a keen note\nof triumph as it went. The willow wand was split in twain, as though it\nhad met a hunter's knife.\n\n\"Verily, I think your bow is armed with witchcraft!\" cried Gilbert. \"For\nI did not believe such shooting possible.\"\n\n\"You should come to see our merry lads in the greenwood,\" retorted Robin\nlightly. \"For willow wands do not grow upon the cobblestones of London\ntown.\"\n\nMeanwhile the King in great wrath had risen to depart, first signing the\njudges to distribute the prizes. Never a word said he, of good or\nill, to the Queen, but mounted his horse and, followed by his sons and\nknights, rode off the field. The archers dropped upon one knee as he\npassed, but he gave them a single baleful look and was gone.\n\nThen the Queen beckoned the outlaws to approach, and they did so and\nknelt at her feet.\n\n\"Right well have ye served me,\" she said, \"and sorry am I that the\nKing's anger is aroused thereby. But fear ye not. His word and grace\nhold true. As to these prizes ye have gained, I add others of mine\nown--the wagers I have won from His Majesty the King and from the lord\nBishop of Hereford. Buy with some of these moneys the best swords ye\ncan find in London, for all your band, and call them the swords of the\nQueen. And swear with them to protect all the poor and the helpless and\nthe women--kind who come your way.\"\n\n\"We swear,\" said the five yeomen solemnly.\n\nThen the Queen gave each of them her hand to kiss, and arose and\ndeparted with all her ladies. And after they were gone, the King's\narchers came crowding around Robin and his men, eager to get a glimpse\nof the fellows about whom they had heard so much. And back of them came\na great crowd of the spectators pushing and jostling in their efforts to\ncome nearer.\n\n\"Verily!\" laughed Little John, \"they must take us for a Merry Andrew\nshow!\"\n\nNow the judges came up, and announced each man his prize, according\nto the King's command. To Robin was give the purse containing twoscore\ngolden pounds; to Little John the twoscore silver pennies; and to\nAllan-a-Dale the fine inlaid bugle, much to his delight, for he was\nskilled at blowing sweet tunes upon the horn hardly less than handling\nthe harp strings. But when the Rhenish wine and English beer and harts\nof Dallom Lea were spoken of, Robin said:\n\n\"Nay, what need we of wine or beer, so far from the greenwood? And\n'twould be like carrying coals to Newcastle, to drive those harts to\nSherwood! Now Gilbert and Tepus and their men have shot passing well.\nWherefore, the meat and drink must go to them, an they will accept it of\nus.\"\n\n\"Right gladly,\" replied Gilbert grasping his hand. \"Ye are good men\nall, and we will toast you every one, in memory of the greatest day at\narchery that England has ever seen, or ever will see!\"\n\nThus said all the King's archers, and the hand of good-fellowship was\ngiven amid much shouting and clapping on the shoulder-blades.\n\nAnd so ended King Harry's tourney, whose story has been handed down from\nsire to son, even unto the present day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD WAS SOUGHT OF THE TINKER\n\n     And while the tinker fell asleep,\n     Robin made haste away,\n     And left the tinker in the lurch,\n     For the great shot to pay.\n\nKing Henry was as good as his word. Robin Hood and his party were\nsuffered to depart from London--the parting bringing keen sorrow to\nMarian--and for forty days no hand was raised against them. But at\nthe end of that time, the royal word was sent to the worthy Sheriff at\nNottingham that he must lay hold upon the outlaws without further delay,\nas he valued his office.\n\nIndeed, the exploits of Robin and his band, ending with the great\ntourney in Finsbury Field, had made a mighty stir through all England,\nand many there were to laugh boldly at the Nottingham official for his\nfailures to capture the outlaws.\n\nThe Sheriff thereupon planned three new expeditions into the greenwood,\nand was even brave enough to lead them, since he had fifteen-score men\nat his beck and call each time. But never the shadow of an outlaw did\nhe see, for Robin's men lay close, and the Sheriff's men knew not how to\ncome at their chief hiding-place in the cove before the cavern.\n\nNow the Sheriff's daughter had hated Robin Hood bitterly in her heart\never since the day he refused to bestow upon her the golden arrow, and\nshamed her before all the company. His tricks, also, upon her father\nwere not calculated to lessen her hatred, and so she sought about for\nmeans to aid the Sheriff in catching the enemy.\n\n\"There is no need to go against this man with force of arms,\" she said.\n\"We must meet his tricks with other tricks of our own.\"\n\n\"Would that we could!\" groaned the Sheriff. \"The fellow is becoming a\nnightmare unto me.\"\n\n\"Let me plan a while,\" she replied. \"Belike I can cook up some scheme\nfor his undoing.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said the Sheriff, \"and if anything comes of your planning,\nI will e'en give you an hundred silver pennies for a new gown, and a\ndouble reward to the man who catches the outlaws.\"\n\nNow upon that same day, while the Sheriff's daughter was racking her\nbrains for a scheme, there came to the Mansion House a strolling tinker\nnamed Middle, a great gossip and braggart. And as he pounded away upon\nsome pots and pans in the scullery, he talked loudly about what _he_\nwould do, if he once came within reach of that rascal Robin Hood.\n\n\"It might be that this simple fellow could do something through his\nvery simplicity,\" mused the Sheriff's daughter, overhearing his prattle.\n\"Odds bodikins! 'twill do no harm to try his service, while I bethink\nmyself of some better plan.\"\n\nAnd she called him to her, and looked him over--a big brawny fellow\nenough, with an honest look about the eye, and a countenance so open\nthat when he smiled his mouth seemed the only country on the map.\n\n\"I am minded to try your skill at outlaw catching,\" she said, \"and will\nadd goodly measure to the stated reward if you succeed. Do you wish to\nmake good your boasted prowess?\"\n\nThe tinker grinned broadly.\n\n\"Yes, your ladyship,\" he said.\n\n\"Then here is a warrant made out this morning by the Sheriff himself.\nSee that you keep it safely and use it to good advantage.\"\n\nAnd she dismissed him.\n\nMiddle departed from the house mightily pleased with himself, and\nproud of his commission. He swung his crab-tree-staff recklessly in his\nglee--so recklessly that he imperiled the shins of more than one angry\npasser-by--and vowed he'd crack the ribs of Robin Hood with it, though\nhe was surrounded by every outlaw in the whole greenwood.\n\nSpurred on by the thoughts of his own coming bravery, he left the town\nand proceeded toward Barnesdale. The day was hot and dusty, and at\nnoontime he paused at a wayside inn to refresh himself. He began by\neating and drinking and dozing, in turn, then sought to do all at once.\n\nMine host of the \"Seven Does\" stood by, discussing the eternal Robin\nwith a drover.\n\n\"Folk do say that my lord Sheriff has sent into Lincoln for more\nmen-at-arms and horses, and that when he has these behind him, he'll\nsoon rid the forest of these fellows.\"\n\n\"Of whom speak you?\" asked the tinker sitting up.\n\n\"Of Robin Hood and his men,\" said the host; \"but go to sleep again. You\nwill never get the reward!\"\n\n\"And why not?\" asked the tinker, rising with great show of dignity.\n\n\"Where our Sheriff has failed, and the stout Guy of Gisborne, and many\nmore beside, it behoves not a mere tinker to succeed.\"\n\nThe tinker laid a heavy hand upon the innkeeper's fat shoulder, and\ntried to look impressive.\n\n\"There is your reckoning, host, upon the table. I must e'en go upon my\nway, because I have more important business than to stand here gossiping\nwith you. But be not surprised, if, the next time you see me, I shall\nhave with me no less person than Robin Hood himself!\"\n\nAnd he strode loftily out the door and walked up the hot white road\ntoward Barnesdale.\n\nHe had not gone above a quarter of a mile when he met a young man with\ncurling brown hair and merry eyes. The young man carried his light cloak\nover his arm, because of the heat, and was unarmed save for a light\nsword at his side. The newcomer eyed the perspiring tinker in a friendly\nway, and seeing he was a stout fellow accosted him.\n\n\"Good-day to you!\" said he.\n\n\"Good-day to you!\" said the tinker; \"and a morrow less heating.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" laughed the other. \"Whence come you? And know you the news?\"\n\n\"What is the news?\" said the gossipy tinker, pricking up his ear; \"I am\na tinker by trade, Middle by name, and come from over against Banbury.\"\n\n\"Why as for the news,\" laughed the stranger, \"I hear that two tinkers\nwere set i' the stocks for drinking too much ale and beer.\"\n\n\"If that be all your news,\" retorted Middle, \"I can beat you clear to\nthe end of the lane.\"\n\n\"What news have you? Seeing that you go from town to town, I ween you\ncan outdo a poor country yokel at tidings.\"\n\n\"All I have to tell,\" said the other, \"is that I am especially\ncommissioned\"--he felt mightily proud of these big words--\"especially\ncommissioned to seek a bold outlaw which they call Robin Hood.\"\n\n\"So?\" said the other arching his brows. \"How 'especially commissioned'?\"\n\n\"I have a warrant from the Sheriff, sealed with the King's own seal, to\ntake him where I can; and if you can tell me where he is, I will e'en\nmake a man of you.\"\n\n\"Let me see the warrant,\" said the other, \"to satisfy myself if it be\nright; and I will do the best I can to bring him to you.\"\n\n\"That will I not,\" replied the tinker; \"I will trust none with it.\nAnd if you'll not help me to come at him I must forsooth catch him by\nmyself.\"\n\nAnd he made his crab-tree-staff whistle shrill circles in the air.\n\nThe other smiled at the tinker's simplicity, and said:\n\n\"The middle of the road on a hot July day is not a good place to talk\nthings over. Now if you're the man for me and I'm the man for you, let's\ngo back to the inn, just beyond the bend of road, and quench our thirst\nand cool our heads for thinking.\"\n\n\"Marry come up!\" quoth the tinker. \"That will I! For though I've just\ncome from there, my thirst rises mightily at the sound of your voice.\"\n\nSo back he turned with the stranger and proceeded to the \"Seven Does.\"\n\nThe landlord arched his eyebrows silently when he saw the two come in,\nbut served them willingly.\n\nThe tinker asked for wine, and Robin for ale. The wine was not the most\ncooling drink in the cellar, nor the clearest headed. Nathless, the\ntinker asked for it, since it was expensive and the other man had\ninvited him to drink. They lingered long over their cups, Master Middle\nemptying one after another while the stranger expounded at great length\non the best plans for coming at and capturing Robin Hood.\n\nIn the end the tinker fell sound asleep while in the act of trying to\nget a tankard to his lips. Then the stranger deftly opened the snoring\nman's pouch, took out the warrant, read it, and put it in his own\nwallet. Calling mine host to him, he winked at him with a half smile and\ntold him that the tinker would pay the whole score when he awoke. Thus\nwas Master Middle left in the lurch \"for the great shot to pay.\"\n\nNathless, the stranger seemed in no great hurry. He had the whim to stay\nawhile and see what the droll tinker might do when he awoke. So he hid\nbehind a window shutter, on the outside, and awaited events.\n\nPresently the tinker came to himself with a prodigious yawn, and reached\nat once for another drink.\n\n\"What were you saying, friend, about the best plan (ya-a-a-ah!) for\ncatching this fellow?--Hello!--where's the man gone?\"\n\nHe had looked around and saw no one with him at the table.\n\n\"Host! host!\" he shouted, \"where is that fellow who was to pay my\nreckoning?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" answered the landlord sharply. \"Mayhap he left the money\nin your purse.\"\n\n\"No he didn't!\" roared Middle, looking therein. \"Help! Help! I've been\nrobbed! Look you, host, you are liable to arrest for high treason! I am\nhere upon the King's business, as I told you earlier in the day. And yet\nwhile I did rest under your roof, thinking you were an honest man (hic!)\nand one loving of the King, my pouch has been opened and many matters of\nstate taken from it.\"\n\n\"Cease your bellowing!\" said the landlord. \"What did you lose?\"\n\n\"Oh, many weighty matters, I do assure you. I had with me, item, a\nwarrant, granted under the hand of my lord High Sheriff of Nottingham,\nand sealed with the Kings's own seal, for the capture (hic!)--and\narrest--and overcoming of a notorious rascal, one Robin Hood of\nBarnesdale. Item, one crust of bread. Item, one lump (hic!) of solder.\nItem, three pieces of twine. Item, six single keys (hic!), useful\nwithal. Item, twelve silver pennies, the which I earned this week (hic!)\nin fair labor. Item--\"\n\n\"Have done with your items!\" said the host. \"And I marvel greatly to\nhear you speak in such fashion of your friend, Robin Hood of Barnesdale.\nFor was he not with you in all good-fellowship?\"\n\n\"Wh-a-at? _That_ Robin Hood?\" gasped Middle with staring eyes. \"Why did\nyou not tell me?\"\n\n\"Faith, _I_ saw no need o' telling you! Did you not tell me the first\ntime you were here to-day, that I need not be surprised if you came back\nwith no less person than Robin Hood himself?\"\n\n\"Jesu give me pardon!\" moaned the tinker. \"I see it all now. He got me\nto drinking, and then took my warrant, and my pennies, and my crust--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" interrupted the host. \"I know all about that. But pay me the\nscore for both of you.\"\n\n\"But I have no money, gossip. Let me go after that vile bag-o'-bones,\nand I'll soon get it out of him.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" replied the other. \"If I waited for you to collect from Robin\nHood, I would soon close up shop.\"\n\n\"What is the account?\" asked Middle.\n\n\"Ten shillings, just.\"\n\n\"Then take here my working-bag and my good hammer too; and if I light\nupon that knave I will soon come back after them.\"\n\n\"Give me your leathern coat as well,\" said mine host; \"the hammer and\nbag of tools are as naught to me.\"\n\n\"Gramercy!\" cried Master Middle, losing what was left of his temper.\n\"It seems that I have escaped one thief only to fall into the hands of\nanother. If you will but walk with me out into the middle of the road,\nI'll give you such a crack as shall drive some honesty into your thick\nskull.\"\n\n\"You are wasting your breath and my time,\" retorted the landlord.\n\n\"Give me your things, and get you gone after your man, speedily.\"\n\nMiddle thought this to be good advice; so he strode forth from the\n\"Seven Does\" in a black mood.\n\nEre he had gone half a mile, he saw Robin Hood walking demurely among\nthe trees a little in front of him.\n\n\"Ho there, you villain!\" roared the tinker. \"Stay your steps! I am\ndesperately in need of you this day!\"\n\nRobin turned about with a surprised face.\n\n\"What knave is this?\" he asked gently, \"who comes shouting after me?\"\n\n\"No knave! no knave at all!\" panted the other, rushing up. \"But an\nhonest--man--who would have--that warrant--and the money for drink!\"\n\n\"Why, as I live, it is our honest tinker who was seeking Robin Hood! Did\nyou find him, gossip?\"\n\n\"Marry, that did I! and I'm now going to pay him my respects!\"\n\nAnd he plunged at him, making a sweeping stroke with his\ncrab-tree-cudgel.\n\nRobin tried to draw his sword, but could not do it for a moment through\ndodging the other's furious blows. When he did get it in hand, the\ntinker had reached him thrice with resounding thwacks. Then the tables\nwere turned, for he dashed in right manfully with his shining blade and\nmade the tinker give back again.\n\nThe greenwood rang with the noise of the fray. 'Twas steel against\nwood, and they made a terrible clattering when they came together. Robin\nthought at first that he could hack the cudgel to pieces, for his blade\nwas one of Toledo--finely tempered steel which the Queen had given him.\nBut the crab-tree-staff had been fired and hardened and seasoned by the\ntinker's arts until it was like a bar of iron--no pleasant neighbor for\none's ribs.\n\nRobin presently found this out to his sorrow. The long reach and long\nstick got to him when 'twas impossible for him to touch his antagonist.\nSo his sides began to ache sorely.\n\n\"Hold your hand, tinker,\" he said at length. \"I cry a boon of you.\"\n\n\"Before I do it,\" said the tinker, \"I'd hang you on this tree.\"\n\nBut even as he spoke, Robin found the moment's grace for which he\nlonged; and immediately grasped his horn and blew the three well-known\nblasts of the greenwood.\n\n\"A murrain seize you!\" roared the tinker commencing afresh. \"Up to your\nold tricks again, are you? Well, I'll have time to finish my job, if I\nhurry.\"\n\nBut Robin was quite able to hold his own at a pinch, and they had not\nexchanged many lunges and passes when up came Little John and Will\nScarlet and a score of yeomen at their heels. Middle was seized without\nceremony, while Robin sat himself down to breathe. \"What is the matter?\"\nquoth Little John, \"that you should sit so weariedly upon the highway\nside?\"\n\n\"Faith, that rascally tinker yonder has paid his score well upon my\nhide,\" answered Robin ruefully.\n\n\"That tinker, then,\" said Little John, \"must be itching for more work.\nFain would I try if he can do as much for me.\"\n\n\"Or me,\" said Will Scarlet, who like Little John was always willing to\nswing a cudgel.\n\n\"Nay,\" laughed Robin. \"Belike I could have done better, an he had given\nme time to pull a young tree up by the roots. But I hated to spoil\nthe Queen's blade upon his tough stick or no less tough hide. He had a\nwarrant for my arrest which I stole from him.\"\n\n\"Also, item, twelve silver pennies,\" interposed the tinker, unsubdued;\n\"item, one crust of bread, 'gainst my supper. Item, one lump of solder.\nItem, three pieces of twine. Item, six single keys. Item--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" quoth the merry Robin; \"I stood outside the landlord's\nwindow and heard you count over your losses. Here they are again; and\nthe silver pennies are turned by magic into gold. Here also, if you\nwill, is my hand.\"\n\n\"I take it heartily, with the pence!\" cried Middle. \"By my leathern coat\nand tools, which I shall presently have out of that sly host, I swear\nthat I never yet met a man I liked as well as you! An you and your\nmen here will take me, I swear I'll serve you honestly. Do you want\na tinker? Nay, but verily you must! Who else can mend and grind your\nswords and patch your pannikins--and fight, too, when occasion serve?\nMend your pots! mend your pa-a-ans!\"\n\nAnd he ended his speech with the sonorous cry of his craft.\n\nBy this time the whole band was laughing uproariously at the tinker's\ntalk.\n\n\"What say you, fellows?\" asked Robin. \"Would not this tinker be a good\nrecruit?\"\n\n\"That he would!\" answered Will Scarlet, clapping the new man on the\nback. \"He will keep Friar Tuck and Much the miller's son from having the\nblues.\"\n\nSo amid great merriment and right good fellowship the outlaws shook\nMiddle by the hand, and he took oath of fealty, and thought no more of\nthe Sheriff's daughter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD WAS TANNED OF THE TANNER\n\n     In Nottingham there lived a jolly tanner,\n     With a hey down, down, a down down!\n     His name was Arthur-a-Bland,\n     There was ne'er a squire in Nottinghamshire\n\n     Dare bid bold Arthur stand.\n     And as he went forth, in a summer's morning,\n     With a hey down, down, a down down!\n     To the forest of merrie Sherwood,\n     To view the red deer, that range here and there,\n     There met he with bold Robin Hood.\n\nThe Sheriff's daughter bided for several days in the faint hope that she\nmight hear tidings of the prattling tinker. But never a word heard she,\nand she was forced to the conclusion that her messenger had not so much\nas laid eyes upon the outlaw. Little recked she that he was, even then,\ngrinding sword-points and sharpening arrows out in the good greenwood,\nwhile whistling blithely or chatting merrily with the good Friar Tuck.\n\nThen she bethought herself of another good man, one Arthur-a-Bland, a\ntanner who dwelt in Nottingham town and was far-famed in the tourneys\nround about. He had done some pretty tricks at archery, but was\nstrongest at wrestling and the quarter-staff. For three years he had\ncast all comers to the earth in wrestling until the famous Eric\no' Lincoln broke a rib for him in a mighty tussle. Howsoever, at\nquarter-staff he had never yet met his match; so that there was never a\nsquire in Nottinghamshire dare bid bold Arthur stand.\n\n     With a long pike-staff on his shoulder,\n     So well he could clear his way\n     That by two and three he made men flee\n     And none of them could stay.\n\nThus at least runs the old song which tells of his might.\n\n\"This is just the man for me!\" thought the Sheriff's daughter to\nherself; and she forthwith summoned him to the Mansion House and\ncommissioned him to seek out Robin Hood.\n\nThe warrant was quite to Arthur's liking, for he was happiest when out\nin the forest taking a sly peep at the King's deer; and now he reckoned\nthat he could look at them boldly, instead of by the rays of the moon.\nHe could say to any King's Forester who made bold to stop him: \"I am\nhere on the King's business!\"\n\n\"Gramercy! No more oak-bark and ditch-water and the smell of half-tanned\nhides to-day!\" quoth he, gaily. \"I shall e'en see what the free air of\nheaven tastes like, when it sweeps through the open wood.\"\n\nSo the tanner departed joyfully upon his errand, but much more\ninterested in the dun deer of the forest than in any two-legged rovers\ntherein. This interest had, in fact, caused the Foresters to keep a\nshrewd eye upon him in the past, for his tannery was apt to have plenty\nof meat in it that was more like venison than the law allowed. As for\nthe outlaws, Arthur bore them no ill-will; indeed he had felt a secret\nenvy in his heart at their free life; but he was not afraid to meet any\ntwo men who might come against him. Nathless, the Sheriff's daughter did\nnot choose a very good messenger, as you shall presently see.\n\nAway sped the tanner, a piece of bread and some wine in his wallet,\na good longbow and arrows slung across his shoulder, his stout\nquarter-staff in his hand, and on his head a cap of trebled raw-hide so\ntough that it would turn the edge of a broadsword. He lost no time in\ngetting out of the hot sun and into the welcome shade of the forest,\nwhere he stalked cautiously about seeking some sign of the dun deer.\n\nNow it so chanced that upon that very morning Robin Hood had sent Little\nJohn to a neighboring village to buy some cloth of Lincoln green for new\nsuits for all the band. Some of the money recently won of the King\nwas being spent in this fashion, 'gainst the approach of winter. Will\nScarlet had been sent on a similar errand to Barnesdale some time\nbefore, if you remember, only to be chased up the hill without his\npurchase. So to-day Little John was chosen, and for sweet company's\nsake Robin went with him a part of the way until they came to the \"Seven\nDoes,\" the inn where Robin had recently played his prank upon Middle the\ntinker. Here they drank a glass of ale to refresh themselves withal,\nand for good luck; and Robin tarried a bit while Little John went on his\nerrand.\n\nPresently Robin entered the edge of the wood, when whom should he see\nbut Arthur-a-Bland, busily creeping after a graceful deer that browsed\nalone down the glade. \"Now by Saint George and the Dragon!\" quoth Robin\nto himself. \"I much fear that yon same fellow is a rascally poacher come\nafter our own and the King's meat!\"\n\nFor you must know, by a curious process of reasoning, Robin and his men\nhad hunted in the royal preserves so long that they had come to consider\nthemselves joint owners to every animal which roamed therein.\n\n\"Nay!\" he added, \"this must be looked into! That cow-skin cap in sooth\nmust hide a scurvy varlet!\"\n\nAnd forthwith he crept behind a tree, and thence to another, stalking\nour friend Arthur as busily as Arthur was stalking the deer.\n\nThis went on for quite a space, until the tanner began to come upon the\ndeer and to draw his bow in order to tickle the victim's ribs with a\ncloth-yard shaft. But just at this moment Robin unluckily trod upon a\ntwig which snapped and caused the tanner to turn suddenly.\n\nRobin saw that he was discovered, so he determined to put a bold face on\nthe matter, and went forward with some smart show of authority.\n\n\"Hold!\" he cried: \"stay your hand! Why, who are you, bold fellow, to\nrange so boldly here? In sooth, to be brief, ye look like a thief that\nhas come to steal the King's deer.\"\n\n\"Marry, it is scant concern of yours, what I look like!\" retorted\nArthur-a-Bland. \"Who are you, who speak so bravely?\"\n\n\"You shall soon find out who I am!\" quoth Robin, determining to find\nsome sport in the matter. \"I am a keeper of this forest. The King knows\nthat I am looking after his deer for him; and therefore we must stay\nyou.\"\n\n\"Have you any assistants, friend?\" asked the tanner calmly. \"For it is\nnot one man alone who can stop me.\"\n\n\"Nay truly, gossip,\" replied Robin. \"I have a good yew bow, also a right\nsharp blade at my side. Nathless I need no better assistant than a good\noak-graff like unto yours. Give me a baker's dozen of minutes with\nit and it shall pleasure me to crack that pate of yours for your\nsauciness!\"\n\n\"Softly, my man! Fair and softly! Big words never killed so much as a\nmouse--least of all yon deer which has got away while you were filling\nall the woods with your noisy breath. So choose your own playthings. For\nyour sword and your bow I care not a straw; nor for all your arrows to\nboot. If I get but a knock at you, 'twill be as much as you'll need.\"\n\n\"Now by our Lady! Will you listen to the braggart?\" cried Robin in a\nfine rage. \"Marry, but I'll teach ye to be more mannerly!\"\n\nSo saying he unbuckled his belt; and, flinging his bow upon the ground\nhe seized hold of a young sapling that was growing near by. His hunting\nknife soon had it severed and lopped into shape.\n\n\"Now come, fellow!\" said Arthur-a-Bland, seeing that he was ready. \"And\nif I do not tan your hide for you in better shape than ever calf-skin\nwas turned into top-boots, may a murrain seize me!\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Robin, \"methinks my cudgel is half a foot longer than\nyours. I would have them of even length before you begin your tanning.\"\n\n\"I pass not for length,\" bold Arthur replied; \"my staff is long enough,\nas you will shortly find out. Eight foot and a half, and 'twill knock\ndown a calf\"--here he made it whistle in the air--\"and I hope it will\nknock down you.\"\n\nForthwith the two men spat on their hands, laid firm hold upon their\ncudgels and began slowly circling round each other, looking for an\nopening.\n\nNow it so chanced that Little John had fared expeditiously with his\nerrand. He had met the merchant, from whom he was wont to buy Lincoln\ngreen, coming along the road; and had made known his wants in few words.\nThe merchant readily undertook to deliver the suits by a certain day\nin the following month. So Little John, glad to get back to the cool\nshelter of the greenwood, hasted along the road lately taken by Robin.\n\nPresently he heard the sound of angry voices, one of which he recognized\nas his captain's.\n\n\"Now, Heaven forfend,\" quoth he, \"that Robin Hood has fallen into the\nclutches of a King's man! I must take a peep at this fray.\"\n\nSo he cautiously made his way from tree to tree, as Robin had done, till\nhe came to the little open space where Robin and Arthur were circling\nabout each other with angry looks, like two dogs at bay.\n\n\"Ha! this looks interesting!\" muttered Little John to himself, for he\nloved a good quarter-staff bout above anything else in the world, and\nwas the best man at it in all the greenwood. And he crawled quietly\nunderneath a friendly bush--much as he had done when Robin undertook to\nteach Will Scarlet a lesson--and chuckled softly to himself and slapped\nhis thigh and prepared to watch the fight at his ease.\n\nIndeed it was both exciting and laughable. You would have chuckled one\nmoment and caught your breath the next, to see those two stout fellows\nswinging their sticks--each half as long again as the men were, and\nthick as their arm--and edging along sidewise, neither wishing to strike\nthe first blow.\n\nAt last Robin could no longer forbear, and his good right arm swung\nround like a flash. Ping! went the stick on the back of the other's\nhead, raising such a welt that the blood came. But the tanner did not\nseem to mind it at all, for bing! went his own staff in return, giving\nRobin as good as he had sent. Then the battle was on, and furiously it\nwaged. Fast fell the blows, but few save the first ones landed, being\nmet in mid-air by a counter-blow till the thwacking sticks sounded like\nthe steady roll of a kettle-drum and the oak--bark flew as fine as it\nhad ever done in Arthur-a-Bland's tannery.\n\nRound and round they fought, digging their heels into the ground to keep\nfrom slipping, so that you would have vowed there had been a yoke of\noxen ploughing a potato-patch. Round and round, up and down, in and\nout, their arms working like threshing-machines, went the yeoman and the\ntanner, for a full hour, each becoming more astonished every minute that\nthe other was such a good fellow. While Little John from underneath his\nbushy covert had much ado to keep from roaring aloud in pure joy.\n\nFinally Robin saw his chance and brought a full arm blow straight down\nupon the other's head with a force that would have felled a bullock.\nBut Arthur's trebled cow-skin cap here stood him in good stead: the blow\nglanced off without doing more than stunning him. Nathless, he reeled\nand had much ado to keep from falling; seeing which Robin stayed\nhis hand--to his own sorrow, for the tanner recovered his wits in a\nmarvelous quick space and sent back a sidelong blow which fairly lifted\nRobin off his feet and sent him tumbling on to the grass.\n\n\"Hold your hand! hold your hand!\" roared Robin with what little breath\nhe had left. \"Hold, I say, and I will give you the freedom of the\ngreenwood.\"\n\n\"Why, God-a-mercy,\" said Arthur; \"I may thank my staff for that--not\n_you_.\"\n\n\"Well, well, gossip' let be as it may. But prithee tell me your name and\ntrade. I like to know fellows who can hit a blow like that same last.\"\n\n\"I am a tanner,\" replied Arthur-a-Bland. \"In Nottingham long have\nI wrought. And if you'll come to me I swear I'll tan your hides for\nnaught.\"\n\n\"Odds bodikins!\" quoth Robin ruefully. \"Mine own hide is tanned enough\nfor the present. Howsoever, there be others in this wood I would fain\nsee you tackle. Harkee, if you will leave your tan-pots and come with\nme, as sure as my name is Robin Hood, you shan't want gold or fee.\"\n\n\"By the breath o' my body!\" said Arthur, \"that will I do!\" and he\ngripped him gladly by the hand. \"But I am minded that I clean forgot the\nerrand that brought me to Sherwood. I was commissioned by some, under\nthe Sheriff's roof, to capture you.\"\n\n\"So was a certain tinker, now in our service,\" said Robin smilingly.\n\n\"Verily 'tis a new way to recruit forces!\" said the tanner laughing\nloudly. \"But tell me, good Robin Hood, where is Little John? I fain\nwould see him, for he is a kinsman on my mother's side.\"\n\n\"Here am I, good Arthur-a-Bland!\" said a voice; and Little John\nliterally rolled out from under the bush to the sward. His eyes were\nfull of tears from much laughter which had well-nigh left him powerless\nto get on his feet.\n\nAs soon as the astonished tanner saw who it was, he gave Little John a\nmighty hug around the neck, and lifted him up on his feet, and the two\npounded each other on the back soundly, so glad were they to meet again.\n\n\"O, man, man!\" said Little John as soon as he had got his breath. \"Never\nsaw I so fine a sight in all my born days. You did knock him over like\nas he were a ninepin!\"\n\n\"And you do joy to see me thwacked about on the ribs?\" asked Robin with\nsome choler.\n\n\"Nay, not that, master!\" said Little John. \"But 'tis the second time I\nhave had special tickets to a show from beneath the bushes, and I cannot\nforbear my delight. Howsoever, take no shame unto yourself, for\nthis same Arthur-a-Bland is the best man at the quarter-staff in all\nNottinghamshire. It commonly takes two or three men to hold him.\"\n\n\"Unless it be Eric o' Lincoln,\" said Arthur modestly; \"and I well know\nhow you paid him out at the Fair.\"\n\n\"Say no more!\" said Robin springing to his feet; \"for well I know that I\nhave done good business this day, and a few bruises are easy payment\nfor the stout cudgel I am getting into the band. Your hand again, good\nArthur-a-Bland! Come! let us after the deer of which I spoiled your\nstalking.\"\n\n\"Righty gladly!\" quoth Arthur. \"Come, Cousin Little John! Away with\nvats and tan-bark and vile-smelling cowhides! I'll follow you two in the\nsweet open air to the very ends of earth!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD MET SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA\n\n     Then answered him the gentle knight\n     With words both fair and thee:\n     \"God save thee, my good Robin,\n     And all thy company!\"\n\nNow you must know that some months passed by. The winter dragged its\nweary length through Sherwood Forest, and Robin Hood and his merry men\nfound what cheer they could in the big crackling fires before their\nwoodland cave. Friar Tuck had built him a little hermitage not far away,\nwhere he lived comfortably with his numerous dogs.\n\nThe winter, I say, reached an end at last, and the blessed spring came\nand went. Another summer passed on apace, and still neither King nor\nSheriff nor Bishop could catch the outlaws, who, meanwhile, thrived and\nprospered mightily in their outlawry. The band had been increased\nfrom time to time by picked men such as Arthur-a-Bland and David of\nDoncaster--he who was the jolliest cobbler for miles around--until it\nnow numbered a full sevenscore of men; seven companies each with its\nstout lieutenant serving under Robin Hood. And still they relieved the\npurses of the rich, and aided the poor, and feasted upon King's deer\nuntil the lank Sheriff of Nottingham was well-nigh distracted.\n\nIndeed, that official would probable have lost his office entirely, had\nit not been for the fact of the King's death. Henry passed away, as all\nKings will, in common with ordinary men, and Richard of the Lion Heart\nwas proclaimed as his successor.\n\nThen Robin and his men, after earnest debate, resolved to throw\nthemselves upon the mercy of the new King, swear allegiance, and ask to\nbe organized into Royal Foresters. So Will Scarlet and Will Stutely and\nLittle John were sent to London with this message, which they were first\nto entrust privately to Maid Marian. But they soon returned with bad\ntidings. The new King had formerly set forth upon a crusade to the Holy\nLand, and Prince John, his brother, was impossible to deal with--being\ncrafty, cruel and treacherous. He was laying his hands upon all the\nproperty which could easily be seized; among other estates, that of\nthe Earl of Huntingdon, Robin's old enemy and Marian's father, who had\nlately died.\n\nMarian herself was in sore straits. Not only had her estates been taken\naway, and the maid been deprived of the former protection of the Queen,\nbut the evil Prince John had persecuted her with his attentions. He\nthought that since the maid was defenseless he could carry her away to\none of his castles and none could gainsay him.\n\nNo word of this peril reached Robin's ears, although his men brought\nhim word of the seizure of the Huntingdon lands. Nathless he was greatly\nalarmed for the safety of Maid Marian, and his heart cried out for\nher strongly. She had been continually in his thoughts ever since the\nmemorable shooting at London town.\n\nOne morning in early autumn when the leaves were beginning to turn gold\nat the edges, the chestnut-pods to swell with promise of fatness, and\nthe whole wide woodland was redolent with the ripe fragrance of fruit\nand flower, Robin was walking along the edge of a small open glade busy\nwith his thoughts. The peace of the woods was upon him, despite his\nbroodings of Marian and he paid little heed to a group of does quietly\nfeeding among the trees at the far edge of the glade.\n\nBut presently this sylvan picture was rudely disturbed for him. A stag,\nwild and furious, dashed suddenly forth from among the trees, scattering\nthe does in swift alarm. The vicious beast eyed the green-and-gold tunic\nof Robin, and, lowering it head, charged at him impetuously. So sudden\nwas its attack that Robin had no time to bend his bow. He sprang behind\na tree while he seized his weapon.\n\nA moment later the wild stag crashed blindly into the tree-trunk with a\nshock which sent the beast reeling backward, while the dislodged leaves\nfrom the shivering tree fell in a small shower over Robin's head.\n\n\"By my halidom, I am glad it was not me you struck, my gentle friend!\"\nquoth Robin, fixing an arrow upon the string. \"Sorry indeed would be any\none's plight who should encounter you in this black humor.\"\n\nScarcely had he spoken when he saw the stag veer about and fix its\nglances rigidly on the bushes to the left side of the glade. These were\nparted by a delicate hand, and through the opening appeared the slight\nfigure of a page. It was Maid Marian, come back again to the greenwood!\n\nShe advanced, unconscious alike of Robin's horrified gaze and the evil\nfury of the stag.\n\nShe was directly in line with the animal, so Robin dared not launch an\narrow. Her own bow was slung across her shoulder, and her small sword\nwould be useless against the beast's charge. But now as she caught sight\nof the stag she pursed her lips as though she would whistle to it.\n\n\"For the love of God, dear lady!\" cried Robin; and then the words died\nin his throat.\n\nWith a savage snort of rage, the beast rushed at this new and inviting\ntarget--rushed so swiftly and from so short a distance that she could\nnot defend herself. She sprang to one side as it charged down upon her,\nbut a side blow from its antlers stretched her upon the ground. The stag\nstopped, turned, and lowered its head preparing to gore her to death.\n\nAlready its cruel horns were coming straight for her, while she, white\nof face and bewildered by the sudden attack, was struggling to rise\nand draw her sword. A moment more and the end would come. But the sharp\nvoice of Robin and already spoken.\n\n\"Down, Marian!\" he cried, and the girl instinctively obeyed, just as\nthe shaft from Robin's bow went whizzing close above her head and struck\nwith terrific force full in the center of the stag's forehead.\n\nThe beast stumbled in its charge and fell dead, across the body of the\nfainting maid.\n\nRobin was quickly by her side, and dragged the beast from off the girl.\n\nPicking her up in his strong arms, he bore her swiftly to the side of\none of the many brooks which watered the vale.\n\nHe dashed cool water upon her face, roughly almost, in his agony of fear\nthat the she was already dead, and he could have shed tears of joy to\nsee those poor, closed eyelids tremble. He redoubled his efforts; and\npresently she gave a little gasp.\n\n\"Where am I? What is't?\"\n\n\"You are in Sherwood, dear maid, tho', i' faith, we gave you a rude\nreception!\"\n\nShe opened her eyes and sat up. \"Methinks you have rescued me from\nsudden danger, sir,\" she said.\n\nThen she recognized Robin for the first time, and a radiant smile came\nover her face, together with the rare blush of returned vitality,\nand her head sank upon his shoulder with a little tremble and sigh of\nrelief.\n\n\"Oh, Robin, it is you!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Aye, 'tis I. Thank heaven, I was at hand to do you service!\" Robin's\ntones were deep and full of feeling. \"I swear, dear Marian, that I will\nnot let you from my care henceforth.\"\n\nNot another word was spoken for some moments, while her head still\nrested confidingly upon his breast. Then recollecting, he suddenly\ncried:\n\n\"Gramercy, I make but a poor nurse! I have not even asked if any of your\nbones were broken.\"\n\n\"No, not any,\" she answered springing lightly to her feet to show him.\n\n\"That foolish dizziness o'ercame me for the nonce, but we can now\nproceed on our way.\"\n\n\"Nay, I meant not that,\" he protested; \"why should we haste? First tell\nme of the news in London town, and of yourself.\"\n\nSo she told him how that the Prince had seized upon her father's lands,\nand had promised to restore them to her if she would listen to his suit;\nand how that she knew he meant her no good, for he was even then suing\nfor a Princess's hand.\n\n\"That is all, Robin,\" she ended simply; \"and that is why I donned again\nmy page's costume and came to you in the greenwood.\"\n\nRobin's brow had grown fiercely black at the recital of her wrong; and\nhe had laid stern hand upon the hilt of his sword. \"By this sword which\nQueen Eleanor gave me!\" he said impetuously; \"and which was devoted to\nthe service of all womankind, I take oath that Prince John and all his\narmies shall not harm you!\"\n\nSo that is how Maid Marian came to take up her abode in the greenwood,\nwhere the whole band of yeomen welcomed her gladly and swore fealty; and\nwhere the sweet lady of Allan-a-Dale made her fully at home.\n\nBut this was a day of deeds in Sherwood Forest, and we 'gan to tell you\nanother happening which led to later events.\n\nWhile Robin and Marian were having their encounter with the stag, Little\nJohn, Much the miller's son, and Will Scarlet had sallied forth to watch\nthe highroad leading to Barnesdale, if perchance they might find some\nhaughty knight or fat priest whose wallet needed lightening.\n\nThey had scarcely watched the great road known as Watling Street which\nruns from Dover in Kent to Chester town--for many minutes, when they\nespied a knight riding by in a very forlorn and careless manner.\n\n     All dreary was his semblance,\n     And little was his pride,\n     His one\n     foot in the stirrup stood,\n     His other waved beside.\n\n     His visor hung down o'er his eyes,\n     He rode in single array,\n     A sorrier man than he was one\n     Rode never in summer's day.\n\nLittle John came up to the knight and bade him stay; for who can\njudge of a man's wealth by his looks? The outlaw bent his knee in all\ncourtesy, and prayed him to accept the hospitality of the forest.\n\n\"My master expects you to dine with him, to-day,\" quoth he, \"and indeed\nhas been fasting while awaiting your coming, these three hours.\"\n\n\"Who is your master?\" asked the knight.\n\n\"None other than Robin Hood,\" replied Little John, laying his hand upon\nthe knight's bridle.\n\nSeeing the other two outlaws approaching, the knight shrugged his\nshoulders, and replied indifferently.\n\n\"'Tis clear that your invitation is too urgent to admit of refusal,\"\nquoth he, \"and I go with you right willingly, my friends. My purpose\nwas to have dined to-day at Blyth or Doncaster; but nothing matters\ngreatly.\"\n\nSo in the same lackadaisical fashion which had marked all his actions\nthat day, the knight suffered his horse to be led to the rendezvous of\nthe band in the greenwood.\n\nMarian had not yet had time to change her page's attire, when the three\nescorts of the knight hove in sight. She recognized their captive as Sir\nRichard of the Lea, whom she had often seen at court; and fearing lest\nhe might recognize her, she would have fled. But Robin asked her, with a\ntwinkle, if she would not like to play page that day, and she in roguish\nmood consented to do so.\n\n\"Welcome, Sir Knight,\" said Robin, courteously. \"You are come in good\ntime, for we were just preparing to sit down to meat.\"\n\n\"God save and thank you, good master Robin,\" returned the knight; \"and\nall your company. It likes me well to break the fast with you.\"\n\nSo while his horse was cared for, the knight laid aside his own heavy\ngear, and laved his face and hands, and sat down with Robin and all his\nmen to a most plentiful repast of venison, swans, pheasants, various\nsmall birds, cake and ale. And Marian stood behind Robin and filled his\ncup and that of the guest.\n\nAfter eating right heartily of the good cheer, the knight brightened\nup greatly and vowed that he had not enjoyed so good a dinner for nigh\nthree weeks. He also said that if ever Robin and his fellows should come\nto his domains, he would strive to set them down to as good a dinner on\nhis own behalf.\n\nBut this was not exactly the sort of payment which Robin had expected to\nreceive. He thanked the knight, therefore, in set phrase, but reminded\nhim that a yeoman like himself might hardly offer such a dinner to a\nknight as a gift of charity.\n\n\"I have no money, Master Robin,\" answered the knight frankly. \"I have so\nlittle of the world's goods, in sooth, that I should be ashamed to offer\nyou the whole of it.\"\n\n\"Money, however little, always jingles merrily in our pockets,\" said\nRobin, smiling. \"Pray you tell me what you deem a little sum.\"\n\n\"I have of my own ten silver pennies,\" said the knight. \"Here they are,\nand I wish they were ten times as many.\"\n\nHe handed Little John his pouch, and Robin nodded carelessly.\n\n\"What say you to the total, Little John?\" he asked as though in jest.\n\n\"'Tis true enough, as the worthy knight hath said,\" responded the big\nfellow gravely emptying the contents on his cloak.\n\nRobin signed to Marian, who filled a bumper of wine for himself and his\nguest.\n\n\"Pledge me, Sir Knight!\" cried the merry outlaw; \"and pledge me\nheartily, for these sorry times. I see that your armor is bent and that\nyour clothes are torn. Yet methinks I saw you at court, once upon a day,\nand in more prosperous guise. Tell me now, were you a yeoman and made a\nknight by force? Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted\nyour property in lawsuits and the like? Be not bashful with us. We shall\nnot betray your secrets.\"\n\n\"I am a Saxon knight in my own right; and I have always lived a sober\nand quiet life,\" the sorrowful guest replied. \"'Tis true you have seen\nme at court, mayhap, for I was an excited witness of your shooting\nbefore King Harry--God rest his bones! My name is Sir Richard of the\nLea, and I dwell in a castle, not a league from one of the gates of\nNottingham, which has belonged to my father, and his father, and his\nfather's father before him. Within two or three years ago my neighbors\nmight have told you that a matter of four hundred pounds one way or\nthe other was as naught to me. But now I have only these ten pennies of\nsilver, and my wife and son.\"\n\n\"In what manner have you lost your riches?\" asked Robin.\n\n\"Through folly and kindness,\" said the knight, sighing. \"I went with\nKing Richard upon a crusade, from which I am but lately returned, in\ntime to find my son--a goodly youth--grown up. He was but twenty, yet he\nhad achieved a squire's training and could play prettily in jousts and\ntournaments and other knightly games. But about this time he had the ill\nluck to push his sport too far, and did accidentally kill a knight in\nthe open lists. To save the boy, I had to sell my lands and mortgage my\nancestral castle; and this not being enough, in the end I have had to\nborrow money, at a ruinous interest, from my lord of Hereford.\"\n\n\"A most worthy Bishop,\" said Robin ironically. \"What is the sum of your\ndebt?\"\n\n\"Four hundred pounds,\" said Sir Richard, \"and the Bishop swears he will\nforeclose the mortgage if they are not paid promptly.\"\n\n\"Have you any friends who would become surety for you?\"\n\n\"Not one. If good King Richard were here, the tale might be otherwise.\"\n\n\"Fill your goblet again, Sir Knight,\" said Robin; and he turned to\nwhisper a word in Marian's ear. She nodded and drew Little John and Will\nScarlet aside and talked earnestly with them, in a low tone.\n\n\"Here is health and prosperity to you, gallant Robin,\" said Sir Richard,\ntilting his goblet. \"I hope I may pay your cheer more worthily, the next\ntime I ride by.\"\n\nWill Scarlet and Little John had meanwhile fallen in with Marian's idea,\nfor they consulted the other outlaws, who nodded their heads. Thereupon\nLittle John and Will Scarlet went into the cave near by and presently\nreturned bearing a bag of gold. This they counted out before the\nastonished knight; and there were four times one hundred gold pieces in\nit.\n\n\"Take this loan from us, Sir Knight, and pay your debt to the Bishop,\"\nthen said Robin. \"Nay, no thanks; you are but exchanging creditors.\nMayhap we shall not be so hard upon you as the Christian Bishop; yet,\nagain we may be harder. Who can tell?\"\n\nThere were actual tears in Sir Richard's eyes, as he essayed to thank\nthe foresters. But at this juncture, Much, the miller's son, came from\nthe cave dragging a bale of cloth. \"The knight should have a suit worthy\nof his rank, master--think you not so?\"\n\n\"Measure him twenty ells of it,\" ordered Robin.\n\n\"Give him a good horse, also,\" whispered Marian. \"'Tis a gift which will\ncome back four-fold, for this is a worthy man. I know him well.\"\n\nSo the horse was given, also, and Robin bade Arthur-a-Bland ride with\nthe knight as far as his castle, as esquire.\n\nThe knight was sorrowful no longer; yet he could hardly voice his thanks\nthrough his broken utterance. And having spent the night in rest,\nafter listening to Allan-a-Dale's singing, he mounted his new steed the\nfollowing morning an altogether different man.\n\n\"God save you, comrades, and keep you all!\" said he, with deep feeling\nin his tones; \"and give me a grateful heart!\"\n\n\"We shall wait for you twelve months from to-day, here in this place,\"\nsaid Robin, shaking him by the hand; \"and then you will repay us the\nloan, if you have been prospered.\"\n\n\"I shall return it to you within the year, upon my honor as Sir Richard\nof the Lea. And for all time, pray count on me as a steadfast friend.\"\n\nSo saying the knight and his esquire rode down the forest glade till\nthey were lost to view.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nHOW THE BISHOP WAS DINED\n\n     \"O what is the matter?\" then said the Bishop,\n     \"Or for whom do you make this a-do?\n     Or why do you kill the King's venison,\n     When your company is so few?\"\n\n     \"We are shepherds,\" quoth bold Robin Hood,\n     \"And we keep sheep all the year,\n     And we are disposed to be merrie this day,\n     And to kill of the King's fat deer.\"\n\nNot many days after Sir Richard of the Lea came to Sherwood Forest,\nword reached Robin Hood's ears that my lord Bishop of Hereford would\nbe riding that way betimes on that morning. 'Twas Arthur-a-Bland, the\nknight's quondam esquire, who brought the tidings, and Robin's face\nbrightened as he heard it.\n\n\"Now, by our Lady!\" quoth he, \"I have long desired to entertain my lord\nin the greenwood, and this is too fair a chance to let slip. Come, my\nmen, kill me a venison; kill me a good fat deer. The Bishop of Hereford\nis to dine with me today, and he shall pay well for his cheer.\"\n\n\"Shall we dress it here, as usual?\" asked Much, the miller's son.\n\n\"Nay, we play a droll game on the churchman. We will dress it by the\nhighway side, and watch for the Bishop narrowly, lest he should ride\nsome other way.\"\n\nSo Robin gave his orders, and the main body of his men dispersed to\ndifferent parts of the forest, under Will Stutely and Little John,\nto watch other roads; while Robin Hood himself took six of his men,\nincluding Will Scarlet, and Much, and posted himself in full view of the\nmain road. This little company appeared funny enough, I assure you, for\nthey had disguised themselves as shepherds. Robin had an old wool cap,\nwith a tail to it, hanging over his ear, and a shock of hair stood\nstraight up through a hole in the top. Besides there was so much dirt on\nhis face that you would never have known him. An old tattered cloak over\nhis hunter's garb completed his make-up. The others were no less ragged\nand unkempt, even the foppish Will Scarlet being so badly run down at\nthe heel that the court ladies would hardly have had speech with him.\n\nThey quickly provided themselves with a deer and made great preparations\nto cook it over a small fire, when a little dust was seen blowing along\nthe highway, and out of it came the portly Bishop cantering along with\nten men-at-arms at his heels. As soon as he saw the fancied shepherds he\nspurred up his horse, and came straight toward them.\n\n\"Who are ye, fellows, who make so free with the King's deer?\" he asked\nsharply.\n\n\"We are shepherds,\" answered Robin Hood, pulling at his forelock\nawkwardly.\n\n\"Heaven have mercy! Ye seem a sorry lot of shepherds. But who gave you\nleave to cease eating mutton?\"\n\n\"'Tis one of our feast days, lording, and we were disposed to be merry\nthis day, and make free with a deer, out here where they are so many.\"\n\n\"By me faith, the King shall hear of this. Who killed yon beast?\"\n\n\"Give me first your name, excellence, so that I may speak where 'tis\nfitting,\" replied Robin stubbornly.\n\n\"'Tis my lord Bishop of Hereford, fellow!\" interposed one of the guards\nfiercely. \"See that you keep a civil tongue in your head.\"\n\n\"If 'tis a churchman,\" retorted Will Scarlet, \"he would do better to\nmind his own flocks rather than concern himself with ours.\"\n\n\"Ye are saucy fellows, in sooth,\" cried the Bishop, \"and we will see if\nyour heads will pay for your manners. Come! quit your stolen roast and\nmarch along with me, for you shall be brought before the Sheriff of\nNottingham forthwith.\"\n\n\"Pardon, excellence!\" said Robin, dropping on his knees. \"Pardon, I pray\nyou. It becomes not your lordship's coat to take so many lives away.\"\n\n\"Faith, I'll pardon you!\" said the Bishop. \"I'll pardon you, when I see\nyou hanged! Seize upon them, my men!\"\n\nBut Robin had already sprung away with his back against a tree. And\nfrom underneath his ragged cloak he drew his trusty horn and winded the\npiercing notes which were wont to summon the band.\n\nThe Bishop no sooner saw this action than he knew his man, and that\nthere was a trap set; and being an arrant coward, he wheeled his horse\nsharply and would have made off down the road; but his own men, spurred\non the charge, blocked his way. At almost the same instant the bushes\nround about seemed literally to become alive with outlaws. Little John's\nmen came from one side and Will Stutely's from the other. In less time\nthan it takes to tell it, the worthy Bishop found himself a prisoner,\nand began to crave mercy from the men he had so lately been ready to\nsentence.\n\n     \"O pardon, O pardon,\" said the Bishop,\n     \"O pardon, I you pray.\n     For if I had known it had been you,\n     I'd have gone some other way.\"\n\n\"I owe you no pardon,\" retorted Robin, \"but I will e'en treat you better\nthan you would have treated me. Come, make haste, and go along with me.\nI have already planned that you shall dine with me this day.\"\n\nSo the unwilling prelate was dragged away, cheek by jowl, with the\nhalf-cooked venison upon the back of his own horse; and Robin and his\nband took charge of the whole company and led them through the forest\nglades till they came to an open space near Barnesdale.\n\nHere they rested, and Robin gave the Bishop a seat full courteously.\nMuch the miller's son fell to roasting the deer afresh, while another\nand fatter beast was set to frizzle on the other side of the fire.\nPresently the appetizing odor of the cooking reached the Bishop's\nnostrils, and he sniffed it eagerly. The morning's ride had made him\nhungry; and he was nothing loath when they bade him come to the dinner.\nRobin gave him the best place beside himself, and the Bishop prepared to\nfall to.\n\n\"Nay, my lord, craving your pardon, but we are accustomed to have grace\nbefore meat,\" said Robin decorously. \"And as our own chaplain is not\nwith us to-day, will you be good enough to say it for us?\"\n\nThe Bishop reddened, but pronounced grace in the Latin tongue hastily,\nand then settled himself to make the best of his lot. Red wines and ale\nwere brought forth and poured out, each man having a horn tankard from\nwhich to drink.\n\nLaughter bubbled among the diners, and the Bishop caught himself smiling\nat more than one jest. But who, in sooth, could resist a freshly broiled\nvenison streak eaten out in the open air to the tune of jest and good\nfellowship? Stutely filled the Bishop's beaker with wine each time he\nemptied it, and the Bishop got mellower and mellower as the afternoon\nshades lengthened on toward sunset. Then the approaching dusk warned him\nof his position.\n\n\"I wish, mine host,\" quoth he gravely to Robin, who had soberly drunk\nbut one cup of ale, \"that you would now call a reckoning. 'Tis late, and\nI fear the cost of this entertainment may be more than my poor purse can\nstand.\"\n\nFor he bethought himself of his friend, the Sheriff's former experience.\n\n\"Verily, your lordship,\" said Robin, scratching his head, \"I have\nenjoyed your company so much, that I scarce know how to charge for it.\"\n\n\"Lend me your purse, my lord,\" said Little John, interposing, \"and\nI'll give you the reckoning by and by.\" The Bishop shuddered. He had\ncollected Sir Richard's debt only that morning, and was even then\ncarrying it home.\n\n\"I have but a few silver pennies of my own,\" he whined; \"and as for the\ngold in my saddle-bags, 'tis for the church. Ye surely would not levy\nupon the church, good friends.\"\n\nBut Little John was already gone to the saddle-bags, and returning\nhe laid the Bishop's cloak upon the ground, and poured out of the\nportmantua a matter of four hundred glittering gold pieces. 'Twas the\nidentical money which Robin had lent Sir Richard a short while before!\n\n\"Ah!\" said Robin, as though an idea had but just then come to him. \"The\nchurch is always willing to aid in charity. And seeing this goodly sum\nreminds me that I have a friend who is indebted to a churchman for this\nexact amount. Now we shall charge you nothing on our own account; but\nsuffer us to make use of this in aiding my good friend.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" began the Bishop with a wry face, \"this is requiting me ill\nindeed. Was this not the King's meat, after all, that we feasted upon?\nFurthermore, I am a poor man.\"\n\n\"Poor forsooth!\" answered Robin in scorn. \"You are the Bishop of\nHereford, and does not the whole countryside speak of your oppression?\nWho does not know of your cruelty to the poor and ignorant--you who\nshould use your great office to aid them, instead of oppress? Have you\nnot been guilty of far greater robbery than this, even though less\nopen? Of myself, and how you have pursued me, I say nothing; nor of\nyour unjust enmity against my father. But on account of those you have\ndespoiled and oppressed, I take this money, and will use it far more\nworthily than you would. God be my witness in this! There is an end of\nthe matter, unless you will lead us in a song or dance to show that\nyour body had a better spirit than your mind. Come, strike up the harp,\nAllan!\"\n\n\"Neither the one nor the other will I do,\" snarled the Bishop.\n\n\"Faith, then we must help you,\" said Little John; and he and\nArthur-a-Bland seized the fat struggling churchman and commenced to hop\nup and down. The Bishop being shorter must perforce accompany them in\ntheir gyrations; while the whole company sat and rolled about over the\nground, and roared to see my lord of Hereford's queer capers. At last he\nsank in a heap, fuddled with wine and quite exhausted.\n\nLittle John picked him up as though he were a log of wood and carrying\nhim to his horse, set him astride facing the animal's tail; and thus\nfastened him, leading the animal toward the highroad and, starting the\nBishop, more dead than alive, toward Nottingham.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nHOW THE BISHOP WENT OUTLAW-HUNTING\n\n     The Bishop he came to the old woman's house,\n     And called with furious mood,\n     \"Come let me soon see, and bring unto me\n     That traitor, Robin Hood.\"\n\nThe easy success with which they had got the better of the good Bishop\nled Robin to be a little careless. He thought that his guest was too\ngreat a coward to venture back into the greenwood for many a long day;\nand so after lying quiet for one day, the outlaw ventured boldly upon\nthe highway, the morning of the second. But he had gone only half a mile\nwhen, turning a sharp bend in the road, he plunged full upon the prelate\nhimself.\n\nMy lord of Hereford had been so deeply smitten in his pride, that he\nhad lost no time in summoning a considerable body of the Sheriff's men,\noffering to double the reward if Robin Hood could be come upon. This\ncompany was now at his heels, and after the first shock of mutual\nsurprise, the Bishop gave an exultant shout and spurred upon the outlaw.\n\nIt was too late for Robin to retreat by the way he had come, but quick\nas a flash he sprang to one side of the road, dodged under some bushes,\nand disappeared so suddenly that his pursuers thought he had truly been\nswallowed up by magic.\n\n\"After him!\" yelled the Bishop; \"some of you beat up the woods around\nhim, while the rest of us will keep on the main road and head him off on\nthe other side!\"\n\nFor, truth to tell, the Bishop did not care to trust his bones away from\nthe highroad.\n\nAbout a mile away, on the other side of this neck of woods, wherein\nRobin had been trapped, was a little tumbledown cottage. 'Twas where\nthe widow lived, whose three sons had been rescued. Robin remembered the\ncottage and saw his one chance to escape.\n\nDoubling in and out among the underbrush and heather with the agility\nof a hare, he soon came out of the wood in the rear of the cottage, and\nthrust his head through a tiny window.\n\nThe widow, who had been at her spinning wheel, rose up with a cry of\nalarm.\n\n\"Quiet, good mother! 'Tis I, Robin Hood. Where are your three sons?\"\n\n\"They should be with you, Robin. Well do you know that. Do they not owe\ntheir lives to you?\"\n\n\"If that be so, I come to seek payment of the debt,\" said Robin in a\nbreath. \"The Bishop is on my heels with many of his men.\"\n\n\"I'll cheat the Bishop and all!\" cried the woman quickly. \"Here, Robin,\nchange your raiment with me, and we will see if my lord knows an old\nwoman when he sees her.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Robin. \"Pass your gray cloak out the window, and also your\nspindle and twine; and I will give you my green mantle and everything\nelse down to my bow and arrows.\"\n\nWhile they were talking, Robin had been nimbly changing clothes with the\nold woman, through the window, and in a jiffy he stood forth complete,\neven to the spindle and twine.\n\nPresently up dashed the Bishop and his men, and, at sight of the\ncottage and the old woman, gave pause. The crone was hobbling along with\ndifficulty, leaning heavily upon a gnarled stick and bearing the spindle\non her other arm. She would have gone by the Bishop's company, while\nmuttering to herself, but the Bishop ordered one of his men to question\nher. The soldier laid his hand upon her shoulder.\n\n\"Mind your business!\" croaked the woman, \"or I'll curse ye!\"\n\n\"Come, come, my good woman,\" said the soldier, who really was afraid of\nher curses. \"I'll not molest you. But my lord Bishop of Hereford wants\nto know if you have seen aught of the outlaw, Robin Hood?\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't I see him?\" she whined. \"Where's the King or law to\nprevent good Robin from coming to see me and bring me food and raiment?\nThat's more than my lord Bishop will do, I warrant ye!\"\n\n\"Peace, woman!\" said the Bishop harshly. \"We want none of your opinions.\nBut we'll take you to Barnesdale and burn you for a witch if you do not\ninstantly tell us when you last saw Robin Hood.\"\n\n\"Mercy, good my lord!\" chattered the crone, falling on her knees.\n\n\"Robin is there in my cottage now, but you'll never take him alive.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" cried the Bishop triumphantly. \"Enter the\ncottage, my men. Fire it, if need be. But I'll give a purse of gold\npieces, above the reward, to the man who captures the outlaw alive.\"\n\nThe old woman, being released, went on her way slowly. But it might\nhave been noticed that the farther she got away from the company and\nthe nearer to the edge of the woods, the swifter and straighter grew\nher pace. Once inside the shelter of the forest she broke into a run of\nsurprising swiftness.\n\n\"Gadzooks!\" exclaimed Little John who presently spied her. \"Who comes\nhere? Never saw I witch or woman run so fast. Methinks I'll send an\narrow close over her head to see which it is.\"\n\n\"O hold your hand! hold your hand!\" panted the supposed woman. \"'Tis I,\nRobin Hood. Summon the yeomen and return with me speedily. We have still\nanother score to settle with my lord of Hereford.\"\n\nWhen Little John could catch his breath from laughing, he winded his\nhorn.\n\n\"Now, mistress Robin,\" quoth he, grinning. \"Lead on! We'll be close to\nyour heels.\"\n\nMeanwhile, back at the widow's cottage the Bishop was growing more\nfurious every moment. For all his bold words, he dared not fire the\nhouse, and the sturdy door had thus far resisted all his men's efforts.\n\n\"Break it down! Break it down!\" he shouted, \"and let me soon see who\nwill fetch out that traitor, Robin Hood!\"\n\nAt last the door crashed in and the men stood guard on the threshold.\nBut not one dared enter for fear a sharp arrow should meet him halfway.\n\n\"Here he is!\" cried one keen-eyed fellow, peering in. \"I see him in the\ncorner by the cupboard. Shall we slay him with our pikes?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Bishop, \"take him alive if you can. We'll make the\nbiggest public hanging of this that the shire ever beheld.\"\n\nBut the joy of the Bishop over his capture was short lived. Down the\nroad came striding the shabby figure of the old woman who had helped him\nset the trap; and very wrathy was she when she saw that the cottage door\nhad been battered in.\n\n\"Stand by, you lazy rascals!\" she called to the soldiers. \"May all the\ndevils catch ye for hurting an old woman's hut. Stand by, I say!\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" ordered the Bishop. \"These are my men and carrying\nout my orders.\"\n\n\"God-mercy!\" swore the beldame harshly. \"Things have come to a pretty\npass when our homes may be treated like common gaols. Couldn't all your\nmen catch one poor forester without this ado? Come! clear out, you and\nyour robber, on the instant, or I'll curse every mother's son of ye,\neating and drinking and sleeping!\"\n\n\"Seize on the hag!\" shouted the Bishop, as soon as he could get in a\nword. \"We'll see about a witch's cursing. Back to town she shall go,\nalongside of Robin Hood.\"\n\n\"Not so fast, your worship!\" she retorted, clapping her hands.\n\nAnd at the signal a goodly array of greenwood men sprang forth from all\nsides of the cottage, with bows drawn back threateningly. The Bishop saw\nthat his men were trapped again, for they dared not stir. Nathless, he\ndetermined to make a fight for it.\n\n\"If one of you but budge an inch toward me, you rascals,\" he cried, \"it\nshall sound the death of your master, Robin Hood! My men have him here\nunder their pikes, and I shall command them to kill him without mercy.\"\n\n\"Faith, I should like to see the Robin you have caught,\" said a clear\nvoice from under the widow's cape; and the outlaw chief stood forth with\nbared head, smilingly. \"Here am I, my lord, in no wise imperiled by your\nmen's fierce pikes. So let us see whom you have been guarding so well.\"\n\nThe old woman who, in the garb of Robin Hood, had been lying quiet in\nthe cottage through all the uproar, jumped up nimbly at this. In the\nbald absurdity of her disguise she came to the doorway and bowed to the\nBishop.\n\n\"Give you good-den, my lord Bishop,\" she piped in a shrill voice; \"and\nwhat does your Grace at my humble door? Do you come to bless me and give\nme alms?\"\n\n\"Aye, that does he,\" answered Robin. \"We shall see if his saddle-bags\ncontain enough to pay you for that battered door.\"\n\n\"Now by all the saints--\" began the Bishop.\n\n\"Take care; they are all watching you,\" interrupted Robin; \"so name them\nnot upon your unchurchly lips. But I will trouble you to hand over that\npurse of gold you had saved to pay for my head.\"\n\n\"I'll see you hanged first!\" raged the Bishop, stating no more than\nwhat would have been so, if he could do the ordering of things. \"Have at\nthem, my men, and hew them down in their tracks!\"\n\n\"Hold!\" retorted Robin. \"See how we have you at our mercy.\" And aiming a\nsudden shaft he shot so close to the Bishop's head that it carried away\nboth his hat and the skull-cap which he always wore, leaving him quite\nbald.\n\nThe prelate turned as white as his shiny head and clutched wildly at his\nears. He thought himself dead almost.\n\n\"Help! Murder!\" he gasped. \"Do not shoot again! Here's your purse of\ngold!\"\n\nAnd without waiting for further parley he fairly bolted down the road.\n\nHis men being left leaderless had nothing for it but to retreat after\nhim, which they did in sullen order, covered by the bows of the yeomen.\nAnd thus ended the Bishop of Hereford's great outlaw-hunt in the forest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nHOW THE SHERIFF HELD ANOTHER SHOOTING MATCH\n\n     \"To tell the truth, I'm well informed\n     Yon match it is a wile;\n     The Sheriff, I know, devises this\n     Us archers to beguile.\"\n\nNow the Sheriff was so greatly troubled in heart over the growing power\nof Robin Hood, that he did a very foolish thing. He went to London town\nto lay his troubles before the King and get another force of troops to\ncope with the outlaws. King Richard was not yet returned from the Holy\nLand, but Prince John heard him with scorn.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said he, shrugging his shoulders. \"What have I to do with all\nthis? Art thou not sheriff for me? The law is in force to take thy\ncourse of them that injure thee. Go, get thee gone, and by thyself\ndevise some tricking game to trap these rebels; and never let me see thy\nface at court again until thou hast a better tale to tell.\"\n\nSo away went the Sheriff in sorrier pass than ever, and cudgeled his\nbrain, on the way home, for some plan of action.\n\nHis daughter met him on his return and saw at once that he had been on a\npoor mission. She was minded to upbraid him when she learned what he\nhad told the Prince. But the words of the latter started her to thinking\nafresh.\n\n\"I have it!\" she exclaimed at length. \"Why should we not hold another\nshooting-match? 'Tis Fair year, as you know, and another tourney will\nbe expected. Now we will proclaim a general amnesty, as did King Harry\nhimself, and say that the field is open and unmolested to all comers.\nBelike Robin Hood's men will be tempted to twang the bow, and then--\"\n\n\"And then,\" said the Sheriff jumping up with alacrity, \"we shall see on\nwhich side of the gate they stop over-night!\"\n\nSo the Sheriff lost no time in proclaiming a tourney, to be held that\nsame Fall at the Fair. It was open to all comers, said the proclamation,\nand none should be molested in their going and coming. Furthermore, an\narrow with a golden head and shaft of silver-white should be given to\nthe winner, who would be heralded abroad as the finest archer in all the\nNorth Countree. Also, many rich prizes were to be given to other clever\narchers.\n\nThese tidings came in due course to Robin Hood, under the greenwood\ntree, and fired his impetuous spirit.\n\n\"Come, prepare ye, my merry men all,\" quoth he, \"and we'll go to the\nFair and take some part in this sport.\"\n\nWith that stepped forth the merry cobbler, David of Doncaster.\n\n\"Master,\" quoth he, \"be ruled by me and stir not from the greenwood. To\ntell the truth, I'm well informed yon match is naught but a trap. I know\nthe Sheriff has devised it to beguile us archers into some treachery.\"\n\n\"That word savors of the coward,\" replied Robin, \"and pleases me not.\nLet come what will, I'll try my skill at that same archery.\"\n\nThen up spoke Little John and said: \"Come, listen to me how it shall be\nthat we will not be discovered.\"\n\n     \"Our mantles all of Lincoln-green\n     Behind us we will leave;\n     We'll dress us all so several,\n     They shall not us perceive.\"\n\n     \"One shall wear white, another red,\n     One yellow, another blue;\n     Thus in disguise to the exercise\n     We'll go, whate'er ensue.\"\n\nThis advice met with general favor from the adventurous fellows, and\nthey lost no time in putting it into practice. Maid Marian and Mistress\nDale, assisted by Friar Tuck, prepared some vari-colored costumes, and\n'gainst the Fair day had fitted out the sevenscore men till you would\nnever have taken them for other than villagers decked for the holiday.\n\nAnd forth went they from the greenwood, with hearts all firm and stout,\nresolved to meet the Sheriff's men and have a merry bout. Along the\nhighway they fell in with many other bold fellows from the countryside,\ngoing with their ruddy-cheeked lasses toward the wide-open gates of\nNottingham.\n\nSo in through the gates trooped the whole gay company, Robin's men\nbehaving as awkwardly and laughing and talking as noisily as the rest;\nwhile the Sheriff's scowling men-at-arms stood round about and sought to\nfind one who looked like a forester, but without avail.\n\nThe herald now set forth the terms of the contest, as on former\noccasions, and the shooting presently began. Robin had chosen five of\nhis men to shoot with him, and the rest were to mingle with the crowd\nand also watch the gates. These five were Little John, Will Scarlet,\nWill Stutely, Much, and Allan-a-Dale'.\n\nThe other competitors made a brave showing on the first round,\nespecially Gilbert of the White Hand, who was present and never shot\nbetter. The contest later narrowed down between Gilbert and Robin. But\nat the first lead, when the butts were struck so truly by various well\nknown archers, the Sheriff was in doubt whether to feel glad or sorry.\nHe was glad to see such skill, but sorry that the outlaws were not in\nit.\n\n     Some said, \"If Robin Hood were here,\n     And all his men to boot,\n     Sure none of them could pass these men,\n     So bravely do they shoot.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" quoth the Sheriff, and scratched his head,\n\n     \"I thought he would be here;\n     I thought he would, but tho' he's bold,\n     He durst not now appear.\"\n\nThis word was privately brought to Robin by David of Doncaster, and the\nsaying vexed him sorely. But he bit his lip in silence.\n\n\"Ere long,\" he thought to himself, \"we shall see whether Robin Hood be\nhere or not!\"\n\nMeantime the shooting had been going forward, and Robin's men had done\nso well that the air was filled with shouts.\n\n     One cried, \"Blue jacket!\" another cried, \"Brown!\"\n     And a third cried, \"Brave Yellow!\"\n     But the fourth man said, \"Yon man in red\n     In this place has no fellow.\"\n\n     For that was Robin Hood himself,\n     For he was clothed in red,\n     At every shot the prize he got,\n     For he was both sure and dead.\n\nThus went the second round of the shooting, and thus the third and last,\ntill even Gilbert of the White Hand was fairly beaten. During all this\nshooting, Robin exchanged no word with his men, each treating the other\nas a perfect stranger. Nathless, such great shooting could not pass\nwithout revealing the archers.\n\nThe Sheriff thought he discovered, in the winner of the golden arrow,\nthe person of Robin Hood without peradventure. So he sent word privately\nfor his men-at-arms to close round the group. But Robin's men also got\nwind of the plan.\n\nTo keep up appearances, the Sheriff summoned the crowd to form in a\ncircle; and after as much delay as possible the arrow was presented. The\ndelay gave time enough for the soldiers to close in. As Robin received\nhis prize, bowed awkwardly, and turned away, the Sheriff, letting his\nzeal get the better of his discretion, grasped him about the neck and\ncalled upon his men to arrest the traitor.\n\nBut the moment the Sheriff touched Robin, he received such a buffet\non the side of his head that he let go instantly and fell back several\npaces. Turning to see who had struck him, he recognized Little John.\n\n\"Ah, rascal Greenleaf, I have you now!\" he exclaimed springing at him.\nJust then, however, he met a new check.\n\n\"This is from another of your devoted servants!\" said a voice which he\nknew to be that of Much the miller's son; and \"Thwack!\" went his open\npalm upon the Sheriff's cheek sending that worthy rolling over and over\nupon the ground.\n\nBy this time the conflict had become general, but the Sheriff's men\nsuffered the disadvantage of being hampered by the crowd of innocent\non-lookers, whom they could not tell from the outlaws and so dared not\nattack; while the other outlaws in the rear fell upon them and put them\nin confusion.\n\nFor a moment a fierce rain of blows ensued; then the clear bugle-note\nfrom Robin ordered a retreat. The two warders at the nearest gate tried\nto close it, but were shot dead in their tracks. David of Doncaster\nthrew a third soldier into the moat; and out through the gate went\nthe foresters in good order, keeping a respectful distance between\nthemselves and the advancing soldiery, by means of their well-directed\nshafts.\n\nBut the fight was not to go easily this day, for the soldiery, smarting\nfrom their recent discomfiture at the widow's cottage, and knowing that\nthe eyes of the whole shire were upon them, fought well, and pressed\nclosely after the retreating outlaws. More than one ugly wound was\ngiven and received. No less than five of the Sheriff's men were killed\noutright, and a dozen others injured; while four of Robin's men were\nbleeding from severe flesh cuts.\n\nThen Little John, who had fought by the side of his chief, suddenly fell\nforward with a slight moan. An arrow had pierced his knee. Robin seized\nthe big fellow with almost superhuman strength.\n\n     Up he took him on his back,\n     And bare him well a mile;\n     Many a time he laid him down,\n     And shot another while.\n\nMeanwhile Little John grew weaker and closed his eyes; at last he sank\nto the ground, and feebly motioned Robin to let him lie. \"Master\nRobin,\" said he, \"have I not served you well, ever since we met upon the\nbridge?\"\n\n\"Truer servant never man had,\" answered Robin.\n\n\"Then if ever you loved me, and for the sake of that service, draw your\nbright brown sword and strike off my head; never let me fall alive into\nthe hand of the Sheriff of Nottingham.\"\n\n\"Not for all the gold in England would I do either of the things you\nsuggest.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" cried Arthur-a-Bland, hurrying to the rescue. And packing\nhis wounded kinsman upon his own broad shoulders, he soon brought him\nwithin the shelter of the forest.\n\nOnce there, the Sheriff's men did not follow; and Robin caused litters\nof boughs to be made for Little John and the other four wounded men.\nQuickly were they carried through the wood until the hermitage of Friar\nTuck was reached, where their wounds were dressed. Little John's hurt\nwas pronounced to be the most serious of any, but he was assured that\nin two or three weeks' time he could get about again; whereat the active\ngiant groaned mightily.\n\nThat evening consternation came upon the hearts of the band. A careful\nroll-call was taken to see it all the yeomen had escaped, when it was\nfound that Will Stutely was missing, and Maid Marian also was nowhere to\nbe found. Robin was seized with dread. He knew that Marian had gone to\nthe Fair, but felt that she would hardly come to grief. Her absence,\nhowever, portended some danger, and he feared that it was connected with\nWill Stutely. The Sheriff would hang him speedily and without mercy, if\nhe were captured.\n\nThe rest of the band shared their leader's uneasiness, though they said\nno word. They knew that if Will were captured, the battle must be fought\nover again the next day, and Will must be saved at any cost. But no man\nflinched from the prospect.\n\nThat evening, while the Sheriff and his wife and daughter sat at meat in\nthe Mansion House, the Sheriff boasted of how he would make an example\nof the captured outlaw; for Stutely had indeed fallen into his hands.\n\n\"He shall be strung high,\" he said, in a loud voice; \"and none shall\ndare lift a finger. I now have Robin Hood's men on the run, and we shall\nsoon see who is master in this shire. I am only sorry that we let them\nhave the golden arrow.\"\n\nAs he spoke a missive sped through a window and fell clattering upon his\nplate, causing him to spring back in alarm.\n\nIt was the golden arrow, and on its feathered shaft was sewed a little\nnote which read:\n\n\"This from one who will take no gifts from liars; and who henceforth\nwill show no mercy. Look well to yourself. R.H.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nHOW WILL STUTELY WAS RESCUED\n\n     Forth of the greenwood are they gone,\n     Yea, all courageously,\n     Resolving to bring Stutely home,\n     Or every man to die.\n\nThe next day dawned bright and sunny. The whole face of nature seemed\ngay as if in despite of the tragedy which was soon to take place in the\nwalls of Nottingham town. The gates were not opened upon this day, for\nthe Sheriff was determined to carry through the hanging of Will Stutely\nundisturbed. No man, therefore, was to be allowed entrance from without,\nall that morning and until after the fatal hour of noon, when Will's\nsoul was to be launched into eternity.\n\nEarly in the day Robin had drawn his men to a point, as near as he\ndared, in the wood where he could watch the road leading to the East\ngate. He himself was clad in a bright scarlet dress, while his men, a\ngoodly array, wore their suits of sober Lincoln green. They were armed\nwith broadswords, and 'each man carried his bow and a full quiver of new\narrows, straightened and sharpened cunningly by Middle, the tinker. Over\ntheir greenwood dress, each man had thrown a rough mantle, making him\nlook not unlike a friar.\n\n\"I hold it good, comrades,\" then said Robin Hood, \"to tarry here in\nhiding for a season while we sent some one forth to obtain tidings.\nFor, in sooth, 'twill work no good to march upon the gates if they be\nclosed.\"\n\n\"Look, master,\" quoth one of the widow's sons. \"There comes a palmer\nalong the road from the town. Belike he can tell us how the land ties,\nand if Stutely be really in jeopardy. Shall I go out and engage him in\nspeech?\"\n\n\"Go,\" answered Robin.\n\nSo Stout Will went out from the band while the others hid themselves\nand waited. When he had come close to the palmer, who seemed a slight,\nyoungish man, he doffed his hat full courteously and said,\n\n\"I crave your pardon, holy man, but can you tell me tidings of\nNottingham town? Do they intend to put an outlaw to death this day?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" answered the palmer sadly. \"'Tis true enough, sorry be the day.\nI have passed the very spot where the gallows-tree is going up. 'Tis out\nupon the roadway near the Sheriff's castle. One, Will Stutely, is to be\nhung thereon at noon, and I could not bear the sight, so came away.\"\n\nThe palmer spoke in a muffled voice; and as his hood was pulled well\nover his head, Stout Will could not discern what manner of man he was.\nOver his shoulder he carried a long staff, with the fashion of a little\ncross at one end; and he had sandaled feet like any monk. Stout Will\nnotice idly that the feet were very small and white, but gave no second\nthought to the matter.\n\n\"Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?\" he\nasked reproachfully.\n\nThe question seemed to put a new idea into the palmer's head. He turned\nso quickly that he almost dropped his hood.\n\n\"Do you think that I should undertake this holy office?\"\n\n\"By Saint Peter and the Blessed Virgin, I do indeed! Else, who will\ndo it? The Bishop and all his whining clerks may be there, but not one\nwould say a prayer for his soul.\"\n\n\"But I am only a poor palmer,\" the other began hesitatingly.\n\n\"Nathless, your prayers are as good as any and better than some,\"\nreplied Will.\n\n\"Right gladly would I go,\" then said the palmer; \"but I fear me I cannot\nget into the city. You may know that the gates are fast locked, for this\nmorning, to all who would come in, although they let any pass out who\nwill.\"\n\n\"Come with me,\" said Stout Will, \"and my master will see that you pass\nthrough the gates.\"\n\nSo the palmer pulled his cloak still closer about him and was brought\nbefore Robin Hood, to whom he told all he knew of the situation. He\nended with,\n\n\"If I may make so bold, I would not try to enter the city from this\ngate, as 'tis closely guarded since yesterday. But on the far side, no\nattack is looked for.\"\n\n\"My thanks, gentle palmer,\" quoth Robin, \"your suggestion is good, and\nwe will deploy to the gate upon the far side.\"\n\nSo the men marched silently but quickly until they were near to the\nwestern gate. Then Arthur-a-Bland asked leave to go ahead as a scout,\nand quietly made his way to a point under the tower by the gate. The\nmoat was dry on this side, as these were times of peace, and Arthur was\nfurther favored by a stout ivy vine which grew out from an upper window.\n\nSwinging himself up boldly by means of this friendly vine, he crept\nthrough the window and in a moment more had sprung upon the warder from\nbehind and gripped him hard about the throat. The warder had no chance\nto utter the slightest sound, and soon lay bound and gagged upon the\nfloor; while Arthur-a-Bland slipped himself into his uniform and got\nhold of his keys.\n\n'Twas the work of but a few moments more to open the gates, let down the\nbridge, and admit the rest of the band; and they lot inside the town so\nquietly that none knew of their coming. Fortune also favored them in the\nfact that just at this moment the prison doors had been opened for\nthe march of the condemned man, and every soldier and idle lout in the\nmarket-lace had trooped thither to see him pass along.\n\nPresently out came Will Stutely with firm step but dejected air. He\nlooked eagerly to the right hand and to the left, but saw none of the\nband. And though more than one curious face betrayed friendship in it,\nhe knew there could be no aid from such source.\n\nWill's hands were tied behind his back. He marched between rows of\nsoldiery, and the Sheriff and the Bishop brought up the rear on horses,\nlooking mightily puffed up and important over the whole proceeding. He\nwould show these sturdy rebels--would the Sheriff--whose word was law!\nHe knew that the gates were tightly fastened; and further he believed\nthat the outlaws would hardly venture again within the walls, even if\nthe gates were open. And as he looked around at the fivescore archers\nand pikemen who lined the way to the gallows, he smiled with grim\nsatisfaction.\n\nSeeing that no help was nigh, the prisoner paused at the foot of the\nscaffold and spoke in a firm tone to the Sheriff.\n\n\"My lord Sheriff,\" quoth he, \"since I must needs die, grant me one boon;\nfor my noble master ne'er yet had a man that was hanged on a tree:\n\n     Give me a sword all in my hand,\n     And let me be unbound,\n     And with thee and thy men will I fight\n     Till I lie dead on the ground.\"\n\nBut the Sheriff would by no means listen to his request; but swore\nthat he should be hanged a shameful death, and not die by the sword\nvaliantly.\n\n     \"O no, no, no,\" the Sheriff said,\n     \"Thou shalt on the gallows die,\n     Aye, and so shall they master too,\n     If ever it in me lie.\"\n\n     \"O dastard coward!\" Stutely cried,\n     \"Faint-hearted peasant slave!\n     If ever my master do thee meet,\n     Thou shalt thy payment have!\"\n\n     \"My noble master thee doth scorn,\n     And all thy cowardly crew,\n     Such silly imps unable are\n     Bold Robin to subdue.\"\n\nThis brave speech was not calculated to soothe the Sheriff. \"To the\ngallows with him!\" he roared, giving a sign to the hangman; and Stutely\nwas pushed into the rude cart which was to bear him under the gallows\nuntil his neck was leashed. Then the cart would be drawn roughly away\nand the unhappy man would swing out over the tail of it into another\nworld.\n\nBut at this moment came a slight interruption. A boyish-looking palmer\nstepped forth, and said:\n\n\"Your Excellency, let me at least shrive this poor wretch's soul ere it\nbe hurled into eternity.\"\n\n\"No!\" shouted the Sheriff, \"let him die a dog's death!\"\n\n\"Then his damnation will rest upon you,\" said the monk firmly. \"You, my\nlord Bishop, cannot stand by and see this wrong done.\"\n\nThe Bishop hesitated. Like the Sheriff, he wanted no delay; but\nthe people were beginning to mutter among themselves and move about\nuneasily. He said a few words to the Sheriff, and the latter nodded to\nthe monk ungraciously.\n\n\"Perform your duty, Sir Priest,\" quoth he, \"and be quick about it!\" Then\nturning to his soldiers. \"Watch this palmer narrowly,\" he commanded.\n\"Belike he is in league with those rascally outlaws.\"\n\nBut the palmer paid no heed to his last words. He began to tell his\nbeads quickly, and to speak in a low voice to the condemned man. But he\ndid not touch his bonds.\n\nThen came another stir in the crowd, and one came pushing through the\npress of people and soldiery to come near to the scaffold.\n\n\"I pray you, Will, before you die, take leave of all your friends!\"\ncried out the well-known voice of Much, the miller's son.\n\nAt the word the palmer stepped back suddenly and looked to one side. The\nSheriff also knew the speaker.\n\n\"Seize him!\" he shouted. \"'Tis another of the crew. He is the villain\ncook who once did rob me of my silver plate. We'll make a double hanging\nof this!\"\n\n\"Not so fast, good master Sheriff,\" retorted Much. \"First catch your man\nand then hang him. But meanwhile I would like to borrow my friend of you\nawhile.\"\n\nAnd with one stroke of his keen hunting-knife he cut the bonds which\nfastened the prisoner's arms, and Stutely leaped lightly from the cart.\n\n\"Treason!\" screamed the Sheriff, getting black with rage. \"Catch the\nvarlets!\"\n\nSo saying he spurred his horse fiercely forward, and rising in his\nstirrups brought down his sword with might and main at Much's head. But\nhis former cook dodged nimbly underneath the horse and came up on the\nother side, while the weapon whistled harmlessly in the air.\n\n\"Nay, Sir Sheriff!\" he cried, \"I must e'en borrow your sword for the\nfriend I have borrowed.\"\n\nThereupon he snatched the weapon deftly from the Sheriff's hand.\n\n\"Here, Stutely!\" said he, \"the Sheriff has lent you his own sword. Back\nto back with me, man, and we'll teach these knaves a trick or two!\"\n\nMeanwhile the soldiers had recovered from their momentary surprise and\nhad flung themselves into the fray. A clear bugle-note had also sounded\nthe same which the soldiers had learned to dread. 'Twas the rallying\nnote of the green wood men.\n\nCloth yard shafts began to hurtle through the air, and Robin and his men\ncast aside their cloaks and sprang forward crying:\n\n\"Lockesley! Lockesley! a rescue! a rescue!\"\n\nOn the instant, a terrible scene of hand to hand fighting followed. The\nSheriff's men, though once more taken by surprise, were determined to\nsell this rescue dearly. They packed in closely and stubbornly about\nthe condemned man and Much and the palmer, and it was only by desperate\nrushes that the foresters made an opening in the square. Ugly cuts and\nbruises were exchanged freely; and lucky was the man who escaped with\nonly these. Many of the onlookers, who had long hated the Sheriff and\nfelt sympathy for Robin's men, also plunged into the conflict--although\nthey could not well keep out of it, in sooth!--and aided the rescuers no\nlittle.\n\nAt last with a mighty onrush, Robin cleaved a way through the press to\nthe scaffold itself, and not a second too soon; for two men with pikes\nhad leaped upon the cart, and were in the act of thrusting down upon the\npalmer and Will Stutely. A mighty upward blow from Robin's good blade\nsent the pike flying from the hand of one, while a well-directed arrow\nfrom the outskirt pierced the other fellow's throat.\n\n\"God save you, master!\" cried Will Stutely joyfully. \"I had begun to\nfear that I would never see your face again.\"\n\n\"A rescue!\" shouted the outlaws afresh, and the soldiery became\nfainthearted and 'gan to give back. But the field was not yet won, for\nthey retreated in close order toward the East gate, resolved to hem\nthe attackers within the city walls. Here again, however, they were in\nerror, since the outlaws did not go out by their nearest gate. They\nmade a sally in that direction, in order to mislead the soldiery, then\nabruptly turned and headed for the West gate, which was still guarded by\nArthur-a-Bland.\n\nThe Sheriff's men raised an exultant shout at this, thinking they had\nthe enemy trapped. Down they charged after them, but the outlaws made\ngood their lead, and soon got through the gate and over the bridge which\nhad been let down by Arthur-a-Bland.\n\nClose upon their heels came the soldiers--so close, that Arthur had no\ntime to close the gate again or raise the bridge. So he threw away his\nkey and fell in with the yeomen, who now began their retreat up the long\nhill to the woods.\n\nOn this side the town, the road leading to the forest was long and\nalmost unprotected. The greenwood men were therefore in some distress,\nfor the archers shot at them from loop-holes in the walls, and the\npikemen were reinforced by a company of mounted men from the castle. But\nthe outlaws retreated stubbornly and now and again turned to hold their\npursuers at bay by a volley of arrows. Stutely was in their midst,\nfighting with the energy of two; and the little palmer was there also,\nbut took no part save to keep close to Robin's side and mutter silent\nwords as though in prayer.\n\nRobin put his horn to his lips to sound a rally, when a flying arrow\nfrom the enemy pierced his hand. The palmer gave a little cry and sprang\nforward. The Sheriff, who followed close with the men on horseback, also\nsaw the wound and gave a great huzza.\n\n\"Ha! you will shoot no more bows for a season, master outlaw!\" he\nshouted.\n\n\"You lie!\" retorted Robin fiercely, wrenching the shaft from his hand\ndespite the streaming blood; \"I have saved one shot for you all this\nday. Here take it!\"\n\nAnd he fitted the same arrow, which had wounded him, upon the string\nof his bow and let it fly toward the Sheriff's head. The Sheriff fell\nforward upon his horse in mortal terror, but not so quickly as to escape\nunhurt. The sharp point laid bare a deep gash upon his scalp and must\ncertainly have killed him if it had come closer.\n\nThe fall of the Sheriff discomfited his followers for the moment, and\nRobin's men took this chance to speed on up the hill. The palmer had\nwhipped out a small white handkerchief and tried to staunch Robin's\nwound as they went. At sight of the palmer's hand, Robin turned with a\nstart, and pushed back the other's hood.\n\n\"Marian!\" he exclaimed, \"you here!\"\n\nIt was indeed Maid Marian, who had helped save Will, and been in the\nstress of battle from the first. Now she hung her head as though caught\nin wrong.\n\n\"I had to come, Robin,\" she said simply, \"and I knew you would not let\nme come, else.\"\n\nTheir further talk was interrupted by an exclamation from Will Scarlet.\n\n\"By the saints, we are trapped!\" he said, and pointed to the top of the\nhill, toward which they were pressing.\n\nThere from out a gray castle poured a troop of men, armed with pikes and\naxes, who shouted and came running down upon them. At the same instant,\nthe Sheriff's men also renewed the pursuit.\n\n\"Alas!\" cried poor Marian, \"we are undone! There is no way of escape!\"\n\n\"Courage, dear heart!\" said Robin, drawing her close to him. But his own\nspirit sank as he looked about for some outlet.\n\nThen--oh, joyful sight!--he recognized among the foremost of those\ncoming from the castle the once doleful knight, Sir Richard of the Lea.\nHe was smiling now, and greatly excited.\n\n\"A Hood! a Hood!\" he cried; \"a rescue! a rescue!\" Never were there more\nwelcome sights and sounds than these. With a great cheer the outlaws\nraced up the hill to meet their new friends; and soon the whole force\nhad gained the shelter of the castle. Bang! went the bridge as it swung\nback, with great clanking of chains. Clash! went one great door upon the\nother, as they shut in the outlaw band, and shut out the Sheriff, who\ndashed up at the head of his men, his bandaged face streaked with blood\nand inflamed with rage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nHOW SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA REPAID HIS DEBT\n\n     The proud Sheriff loud 'gan cry\n     And said, \"Thou traitor knight,\n     Thou keepest here the king's enemy\n     Against the laws and right.\"\n\n\"Open the gate!\" shouted the Sheriff hoarsely, to the sentinel upon the\nwalls. \"Open, I say, in the king's name!\"\n\n\"Why who are you to come thus brawling upon my premises?\" asked a\nhaughty voice; and Sir Richard himself stepped forth upon the turret.\n\n\"You know me well, traitor knight!\" said the Sheriff, \"now give up into\nmy hands the enemy of the King whom you have sheltered against the laws\nand right.\"\n\n\"Fair and softly, sir,\" quoth the knight smoothly. \"I well avow that\nI have done certain deeds this day. But I have done them upon mine\nown land, which you now trespass upon; and I shall answer only to the\nKing--whom God preserve!--for my actions.\"\n\n\"Thou soft-spoken villain!\" said the Sheriff, still in a towering\npassion. \"I, also, serve the King; and if these outlaws are not given up\nto me at once, I shall lay siege to the castle and burn it with fire.\"\n\n\"First show me your warrants,\" said Sir Richard curtly.\n\n\"My word is enough! Am I not Sheriff of Nottingham?\"\n\n\"If you are, in sooth,\" retorted the knight, \"you should know that you\nhave no authority within my lands unless you bear the King's order. In\nthe meantime, go mend your manners, lording.\"\n\nAnd Sir Richard snapped his fingers and disappeared from the walls. The\nSheriff, after lingering a few moments longer in hope of further parley,\nwas forced to withdraw, swearing fiercely.\n\n\"The King's order!\" muttered he. \"That shall I have without delay,\nas well as this upstart knight's estates; for King Richard is lately\nreturned, I hear, from the Holy Land.\"\n\nMeanwhile the knight had gone back to Robin Hood, and the two men\ngreeted each other right gladly. \"Well met, bold Robin!\" cried he,\ntaking him in his arms. \"Well met, indeed! The Lord has lately prospered\nme, and I was minded this day to ride forth and repay my debt to you.\"\n\n\"And so you have,\" answered Robin gaily.\n\n\"Nay, 'twas nothing--this small service!\" said the knight. \"I meant the\nmoneys coming to you.\"\n\n\"They have all been repaid,\" said Robin; \"my lord of Hereford himself\ngave them to me.\"\n\n\"The exact sum?\" asked the knight.\n\n\"The exact sum,\" answered Robin, winking solemnly.\n\nSir Richard smiled, but said no more at the time. Robin was made to rest\nuntil dinner should be served. Meanwhile a leech bound up his hand with\nointment, promising him that he should soon have its use again. Some\nhalfscore others of the yeomen had been hurt in the fight, but luckily\nnone of grave moment. They were all bandaged and made happy by bumpers\nof ale.\n\nAt dinner Sir Richard presented Robin to his wife and son. The lady was\nstately and gracious, and made much of Marian, whom she had known as\na little girl and who was now clothed more seemly for a dinner than in\nmonkish garments. The young esquire was a goodly youth and bade fair to\nmake as stout a knight as his father.\n\nThe feast was a joyous event. There were two long tables, and two\nhundred men sat down at them, and ate and drank and afterward sang\nsongs. An hundred and forty of these men wore Lincoln green and called\nRobin Hood their chief. Never, I ween, had there been a more gallant\ncompany at table in Lea Castle!\n\nThat night the foresters tarried within the friendly walls, and the next\nday took leave; though Sir Richard protested that they should have made\na longer stay. And he took Robin aside to his strong room and pressed\nhim again to take the four hundred golden pounds. But his guest was\nfirm.\n\n\"Keep the money, for it is your own,\" said Robin; \"I have but made the\nBishop return that which he extorted unjustly.\"\n\nSir Richard thanked him in a few earnest words, and asked him and all\nhis men to visit the armory, before they departed. And therein they saw,\nplaced apart, an hundred and forty stout yew bows of cunning make, with\nfine waxen silk strings; and an hundred and forty sheaves of arrows.\nEvery shaft was a just ell long, set with peacock's feathers, and\nnotched with silver. And Sir Richard's fair lady came forward and with\nher own hands gave each yeoman a bow and a sheaf.\n\n\"In sooth, these are poor presents we have made you, good Robin Hood,\"\nsaid Sir Richard; \"but they carry with them a thousand times their\nweight in gratitude.\"\n\nThe Sheriff made good his threat to inform the King. Forth rode he\nto London town upon the week following, his scalp wound having healed\nsufficiently to permit him to travel. This time he did not seek out\nPrince John, but asked audience with King Richard of the Lion Heart\nhimself. His Majesty had but lately returned from the crusades, and was\njust then looking into the state of his kingdom. So the Sheriff found\nready audience.\n\nThen to him the Sheriff spoke at length concerning Robin Hood; how that\nfor many months the outlaws had defied the King, and slain the King's\ndeer; how Robin had gathered about him the best archers in all the\ncountryside; and, finally, how the traitorous knight Sir Richard of the\nLea had rescued the band when capture seemed certain, and refused to\ndeliver them up to justice.\n\nThe King heard him through with attention and quoth he:\n\n\"Meseems I have heard of this same Robin Hood, and his men, and also\nseen somewhat of their prowess. Did not these same outlaws shoot in a\nroyal Tourney at Finsbury field?\"\n\n\"They did, Your Majesty, under a royal amnesty.\"\n\nIn this speech the Sheriff erred, for the King asked quickly,\n\n\"How came they last to the Fair at Nottingham--by stealth?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Did you forbid them to come?\"\n\n\"No, Your Majesty. That is--\"\n\n\"Speak out!\"\n\n\"For the good of the shire,\" began the Sheriff again, falteringly,\n\"we did proclaim an amnesty; but 'twas because these men had proved a\nmenace--\"\n\n\"Now by my halidom!\" quoth the King, while his brow grew black. \"Such\ntreachery would be unknown in the camp of the Saracen; and yet we call\nourselves a Christian people!\"\n\nThe Sheriff kept silence through very fear and shame; then the King\nbegan speech again:\n\n\"Nathless, my lord Sheriff, we promise to look into this matter. Those\noutlaws must be taught that there is but one King in England, and that\nhe stands for the law.\"\n\nSo the Sheriff was dismissed, with very mixed feelings, and went his way\nhome to Nottingham town. A fortnight later the King began to make good\nhis word, by riding with a small party of knights to Lea Castle. Sir\nRichard was advised of the cavalcade's approach, and quickly recognized\nhis royal master in the tall knight who rode in advance. Hasting to open\nwide his castle gates he went forth to meet the King and fell on one\nknee and kissed his stirrup. For Sir Richard, also, had been with the\nKing to the Holy Land, and they had gone on many adventurous quests\ntogether.\n\nThe King bade him rise, and dismounted from his own horse to greet him\nas a brother in arms; and arm-in-arm they went into the castle, while\nbugles and trumpets sounded forth joyous welcome in honor of the great\noccasion.\n\nAfter the King had rested and supped, he turned upon the knight and with\ngrave face inquired:\n\n\"What is this I hear about your castle's becoming a nest and harbor for\noutlaws?\"\n\nThe Sir Richard of the Lea, divining that the Sheriff had been at the\nKing's ear with his story, made a clean breast of all he knew; how that\nthe outlaws had befriended him in sore need--as they had befriended\nothers--and how that he had given them only knightly protection in\nreturn.\n\nThe King liked the story well, for his own soul was one of chivalry.\nAnd he asked other questions about Robin Hood, and heard of the ancient\nwrong done his father before him, and of Robin's own enemies, and of his\nmanner of living.\n\n\"In sooth,\" cried King Richard, springing up, \"I must see this bold\nfellow for myself! An you will entertain my little company, and be ready\nto sally forth, upon the second day, in quest of me if need were, I\nshall e'en fare alone into the greenwood to seek an adventure with him.\"\n\nBut of this adventure you shall be told in the next tale; for I have\nalready shown you how Sir Richard of the Lea repaid his debt, with\ninterest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nHOW KING RICHARD CAME TO SHERWOOD FOREST\n\n     King Richard hearing of the pranks\n     Of Robin Hood and his men,\n     He much admired and more desired\n     To see both him and them.\n\n     Then Robin takes a can of ale:\n     \"Come let us now begin;\n     And every man shall have his can;\n     Here's a health unto the King!\"\n\nFriar Tuck had nursed Little John's wounded knee so skilfully that it\nwas now healed. In sooth, the last part of the nursing depended more\nupon strength than skill; for it consisted chiefly of holding down the\npatient, by main force, to his cot. Little John had felt so well that he\nhad insisted upon getting up before the wound was healed; and he would\nhave done so, if the friar had not piled some holy books upon his legs\nand sat upon his stomach.\n\nUnder this vigorous treatment Little John was constrained to lie quiet\nuntil the friar gave him leave to get up. At last he had this leave, and\nhe and the friar went forth to join the rest of the band, who were right\nglad to see them, you may be sure. They sat around a big fire, for 'twas\na chilly evening, and they feasted and made merry, in great content.\n\nA cold rain set in, later, but the friar wended his way back, nathless,\nto his little hermitage. There he made himself a cheerful blaze, and\nchanged his dripping robe, and had sat himself down, with a sigh of\nsatisfaction, before a tankard of hot mulled wine and a pasty, when\nsuddenly a voice was heard on the outside, demanding admission. His\nkennel of dogs set up furious uproar, on the instant, by way of proving\nthe fact of a stranger's presence.\n\n\"Now by Saint Peter!\" growled the friar, \"who comes here at this\nunseemly hour? Does he take this for a hostelry? Move on, friend, else\nmy mulled wine will get cold!\"\n\nSo saying he put the tankard to his lips, when a thundering rap sounded\nupon the door-panel, making it to quiver, and causing Tuck almost to\ndrop his tankard; while an angry voice shouted, \"Ho! Within there! Open,\nI say!\"\n\n\"Go your way in peace!\" roared back the friar; \"I can do nothing for\nyou. 'Tis but a few miles to Gamewell, if you know the road.\"\n\n\"But I do not know the road, and if I did I would not budge another\nfoot. 'Tis wet without and dry within. So open, without further parley!\"\n\n\"A murrain seize you for disturbing a holy man in his prayers!\" muttered\nTuck savagely. Nathless, he was fain to unbar the door in order to\nkeep it from being battered down. Then lighting a torch at his fire and\nwhistling for one of his dogs, he strode forth to see who his visitor\nmight be.\n\nThe figure of a tall knight clad in a black coat of mail, with plumed\nhelmet, stood before him. By his side stood his horse, also caparisoned\nin rich armor.\n\n\"Have you no supper, brother?\" asked the Black Knight curtly. \"I must\nbeg of you a bed and a bit of roof, for this night, and fain would\nrefresh my body ere I sleep.\"\n\n\"I have no room that even your steed would deign to accept, Sir Knight;\nand naught save a crust of bread and pitcher of water.\"\n\n\"I' faith, I can smell better fare than that, brother, and must e'en\nforce my company upon you, though I shall recompense it for gold in the\nname of the church. As for my horse, let him but be blanketed and put on\nthe sheltered side of the house.\"\n\nAnd without further parley the knight boldly strode past Tuck and his\ndog and entered the hermitage. Something about his masterful air pleased\nTuck, in spite of his churlishness.\n\n\"Sit you down, Sir Knight,\" quoth he, \"and I will fasten up up your\nsteed, and find him somewhat in the shape of grain. Half, also, of my\nbed and board is yours, this night; but we shall see later who is the\nbetter man, and is to give the orders!\"\n\n\"With all my soul!\" said the knight, laughing. \"I can pay my keeping in\nblows or gold as you prefer.\"\n\nThe friar presently returned and drew up a small table near the fire.\n\n\"Now, Sir Knight,\" quoth he, \"put off your sword and helm and such other\nwar-gear as it pleases you, and help me lay this table, for I am passing\nhungry.\"\n\nThe knight did as he was told, and put aside the visor which had hid\nhis face. He was a bronzed and bearded man with blue eyes, and hair shot\nwith gold, haughty but handsome withal.\n\nThen once again the priest sat him down to his pasty and mulled wine,\nright hopefully. He spoke his grace with some haste, and was surprised\nto hear his guest respond fittingly in the Latin tongue. Then they\nattacked the wine and pasty valiantly, and the Black Knight made good\nhis word of being in need of refreshment. Tuck looked ruefully at the\nrapidly disappearing food, but came to grudge it not, by reason of the\nstories with which his guest enlivened the meal. The wine and warmth of\nthe room had cheered them both, and they were soon laughing uproariously\nas the best of comrades in the world. The Black Knight, it seemed, had\ntraveled everywhere. He had been on crusades, had fought the courteous\nSaladin, had been in prison, and often in peril. But now he spoke of\nit lightly, and laughed it off, and made himself so friendly that Friar\nTuck was like to choke with merriment. So passed the time till late; and\nthe two fell asleep together, one on each side of the table which had\nbeen cleared to the platters.\n\nIn the morning Friar Tuck awoke disposed to be surly, but was speedily\nmollified by the sight of the Black Knight, who had already risen gay as\na lark, washed his face and hands, and was now stirring a hot gruel over\nthe fire.\n\n\"By my faith, I make a sorry host!\" cried Tuck springing to his feet.\nAnd later as they sat at breakfast, he added, \"I want not your gold, of\nwhich you spoke last night; but instead I will do what I can to speed\nyou on your way whenever you wish to depart.\"\n\n\"Then tell me,\" said the knight, \"how I may find Robin Hood the outlaw;\nfor I have a message to him from the King. All day yesterday I sought\nhim, but found him not.\"\n\nFriar Tuck lifted up his hands in holy horror. \"I am a lover of peace,\nSir Knight, and do not consort with Robin's bold fellows.\"\n\n\"Nay, I think no harm of Master Hood,\" said the knight; \"but much I\nyearn to have speed with him in mine own person.\"\n\n\"If that be all, mayhap I can guide you to his haunts,\" said Tuck, who\nforesaw in this knight a possible gold-bag for Robin. \"In sooth, I could\nnot well live in these woods without hearing somewhat of the outlaws;\nbut matters of religion are my chief joy and occupation.\"\n\n\"I will go with you, brother,\" said the Black Knight.\n\nSo without more ado they went their way into the forest, the knight\nriding upon his charger, and Tuck pacing along demurely by his side.\n\nThe day had dawned clear and bright, and now with the sun a good three\nhours high a sweet autumn fragrance was in the air. The wind had just\nthat touch of coolness in it which sets the hunter's blood to tingling;\nand every creature of nature seemed bounding with joyous life.\n\nThe knight sniffed the fresh air in delight.\n\n\"By my halidom!\" quoth he; \"but the good greenwood is the best place\nto live in, after all! What court or capital can equal this, for\nfull-blooded men?\"\n\n\"None of this earth,\" replied Tuck smilingly. And once more his heart\nwarmed toward the courteous stranger.\n\nThey had not proceeded more than three or four miles along the way from\nFountain Abbey to Barnesdale, when of a sudden the bushes just ahead of\nthem parted and a well-knit man with curling brown hair stepped into the\nroad and laid his hand upon the knight's bridle.\n\nIt was Robin Hood. He had seen Friar Tuck, a little way back, and\nshrewdly suspected his plan. Tuck, however, feigned not to know him at\nall.\n\n\"Hold!\" cried Robin; \"I am in charge of the highway this day, and must\nexact an accounting from all passersby.\"\n\n\"Who is it bids me hold?\" asked the knight quietly. \"I am not i' the\nhabit of yielding to one man.\"\n\n\"Then here are others to keep me company,\" said Robin clapping his\nhands. And instantly a half-score other stalwart fellows came out of the\nbushes and stood beside him.\n\n\"We be yeomen of the forest, Sir Knight,\" continued Robin, \"and live\nunder the greenwood tree. We have no means of support--thanks to the\ntyranny of our over-lords--other than the aid which fat churchmen and\ngoodly knights like yourselves can give. And as ye have churches and\nrents, both, and gold in great plenty, we beseech ye for Saint Charity\nto give us some of your spending.\"\n\n\"I am but a poor monk, good sir!\" said Friar Tuck in a whining voice,\n\"and am on my way to the shrine of Saint Dunstan, if your worshipfulness\nwill permit.\"\n\n\"Tarry a space with us,\" answered Robin, biting back a smile, \"and we\nwill speed you on your way.\"\n\nThe Black Knight now spoke again. \"But we are messengers of the King,\"\nquoth he; \"His Majesty himself tarries near here and would have speech\nwith Robin Hood.\"\n\n\"God save the King!\" said Robin, doffing his cap loyally; \"and all that\nwish him well! I am Robin Hood, but I say cursed be the man who denies\nour liege King's sovereignty!\"\n\n\"Have a care!\" said the knight, \"or you shall curse yourself!\"\n\n\"Nay, not so,\" replied Robin curtly; \"the King has no more devoted\nsubject than I. Nor have I despoiled aught of his save, mayhap, a few\ndeer for my hunger. My chief war is against the clergy and barons of the\nland who bear down upon the poor. But I am glad,\" he continued, \"that I\nhave met you here; and before we end you shall be my friend and taste of\nour greenwood cheer.\"\n\n\"But what is the reckoning?\" asked the knight. \"For I am told that some\nof your feasts are costly.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" responded Robin waving his hands, \"you are from the King.\nNathless--how much money is in your purse?\"\n\n\"I have no more than forty gold pieces, seeing that I have lain a\nfortnight at Nottingham with the King, and have spent some goodly\namounts upon other lordings,\" replied the knight.\n\nRobin took the forty pounds and gravely counted it. One half he gave to\nhis men and bade them drink the King's health with it. The other half he\nhanded back to the knight.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he courteously, \"have this for your spending. If you lie\nwith kings and lordings overmuch, you are like to need it.\"\n\n\"Gramercy!\" replied the other smiling. \"And now lead on to your\ngreenwood hostelry.\"\n\nSo Robin went on the one side of the knight's steed, and Friar Tuck on\nthe other, and the men went before and behind till they came to the open\nglade before the caves of Barnesdale. Then Robin drew forth his bugle\nand winded the three signal blasts of the band. Soon there came a\ncompany of yeomen with its leader, and another, and a third, and a\nfourth, till there were sevenscore yeomen in sight. All were dressed\nin new livery of Lincoln green, and carried new bows in their hands and\nbright short swords at their belts. And every man bent his knee to Robin\nHood ere taking his place before the board, which was already set.\n\nA handsome dark-haired page stood at Robin's right hand to pour his wine\nand that of the knightly guest; while the knight marveled much at all he\nsaw, and said within himself:\n\n\"These men of Robin Hood's give him more obedience than my fellows give\nto me.\"\n\nAt the signal from Robin the dinner began. There was venison and fowl\nand fish and wheaten cake and ale and red wine in great plenty, and\n'twas a goodly sight to see the smiles upon the hungry yeomen's faces.\n\nFirst they listened to an unctuous grace from Friar Tuck, and then Robin\nlifted high a tankard of ale.\n\n\"Come, let us now begin,\" quoth he, \"and every man shall have his can.\nIn honor of our guest who comes with royal word, here's a health unto\nthe King!\"\n\nThe guest responded heartily to this toast, and round about the board it\nwent, the men cheering noisily for King Richard!\n\nAfter the feast was over, Robin turned to his guest and said, \"Now you\nshall see what life we lead, so that you may report faithfully, for good\nor bad, unto the King.\"\n\nSo at a signal from him, the men rose up and smartly bent their bows for\npractice, while the knight was greatly astonished at the smallness of\nthe their targets. A wand was set up, far down the glade, and thereon\nwas balanced a garland of roses. Whosoever failed to speed his shaft\nthrough the garland, without knocking it off the wand, was to submit to\na buffet from the hand of Friar Tuck.\n\n\"Ho, ho!\" cried the knight, as his late traveling companion rose up and\nbared his brawny arm ready for service; \"so you, my friend, are Friar\nTuck!\"\n\n\"I have not gainsaid it,\" replied Tuck growling at having betrayed\nhimself. \"But chastisement is a rule of the church, and I am seeking the\ngood of these stray sheep.\"\n\nThe knight said no more, though his eyes twinkled; and the shooting\nbegan.\n\nDavid of Doncaster shot first and landed safely through the rose\ngarland. Then came Allan-a-Dale and Little John and Stutely and Scarlet\nand many of the rest, while the knight held his breath from very\namazement. Each fellow shot truly through the garland, until Middle the\ntinker--not to be outdone--stepped up for a trial. But alas! while\nhe made a fair shot for a townsman, the arrow never came within a\nhand-breath of the outer rim of the garland.\n\n\"Come hither, fellow,\" said Little John coaxingly. \"The priest would\nbless thee with his open hand.\"\n\nThen because Middle made a wry face, as though he had already received\nthe buffet, and loitered in his steps, Arthur-a-Bland and Will Stutely\nseized him by the arms and stood him before the friar. Tuck's big arm\nflashed through the air--\"whoof!\" and stopped suddenly against the\ntinker's ear; while Middle himself went rolling over and over on the\ngrass. He was stopped by a small bush, and up he sat, thrusting his head\nthrough it, rubbing his ear and blinking up at the sky as though the\nstars had fallen and struck him. The yeomen roared with merriment, and\nas for the knight, he laughed till the tears came out of his blue eyes\nand rolled down his face.\n\nAfter Middle's mishap, others of the band seemed to lose their balance,\nand fared in the same fashion. The garland would topple over in a most\nimpish way at every breath, although the arrows went through it. So\nMiddle 'gan to feel better when he saw this one and that one tumbling on\nthe sward.\n\nAt last came Robin's turn. He shot carefully, but as ill luck would have\nit the shaft was ill-feathered and swerved sidewise so that it missed\nthe garland by full three fingers. Then a great roar went up from the\nwhole company; for 'twas rare that they saw their leader miss his mark.\nRobin flung his bow upon the ground from very vexation.\n\n\"A murrain take it!\" quoth he. \"The arrow was sadly winged. I felt the\npoor feather upon it as it left my fingers!\"\n\nThen suddenly seizing his bow again, he sped three shafts as fast as he\ncould sent them, and every one went clean through the garland.\n\n\"By Saint George!\" muttered the knight. \"Never before saw I such\nshooting in all Christendom!\"\n\nThe band cheered heartily at these last shots; but Will Scarlet came up\ngravely to Robin.\n\n\"Pretty shooting, master!\" quoth he, \"but 'twill not save you from\npaying for the bad arrow. So walk up and take your medicine!\"\n\n\"Nay, that may not be!\" protested Robin. \"The good friar belongs to\nmy company and has no authority to lift hands against me. But you, Sir\nKnight, stand as it were for the King. I pray you, serve out my blow.\"\n\n\"Not so!\" said Friar Tuck. \"My son, you forget I stand for the church,\nwhich is greater even than the King.\"\n\n\"Not in merry England,\" said the knight in a deep voice. Then rising to\nhis feet, he added, \"I stand ready to serve you, Master Hood.\"\n\n\"Now out upon ye for an upstart knight!\" cried Friar Tuck. \"I told you\nlast night, sirrah, that we should yet see who was the better man! So we\nwill e'en prove it now, and thus settle who is to pay Robin Hood.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Robin, \"for I want not to start a dispute between church\nand state.\"\n\n\"Good!\" also said the knight. \"'Tis an easy way to end prattling. Come,\nfriar, strike and ye dare. I will give you first blow.\"\n\n\"You have the advantage of an iron pot on your head and gloves on your\nhands,\" said the friar; \"but have at ye! Down you shall go, if you were\nGoliath of Gath.\"\n\nOnce more the priest's brawny arm flashed through the air, and struck\nwith a \"whoof!\" But to the amazement of all, the knight did not budge\nfrom his tracks, though the upper half of his body swerved slightly to\nease the force of the blow. A loud shout burst from the yeomen at this,\nfor the friar's fist was proverbial, and few of those present had not\nfelt the force of it in times past.\n\n\"Now 'tis my turn,\" said his antagonist coolly, casting aside his\ngauntlet. And with one blow of his fist the knight sent the friar\nspinning to the ground.\n\nIf there had been uproar and shouting before, it was as naught to the\nnoise which now broke forth. Every fellow held his sides or rolled upon\nthe ground from laughter; every fellow, save one, and that was Robin\nHood.\n\n\"Out of the frying-pan into the fire!\" thought he. \"I wish I had let the\nfriar box my ears, after all!\"\n\nRobin's plight did, indeed, seem a sorry one, before the steel muscles\nof his stranger. But he was saved from a tumble heels over head by\nan unlooked-for diversion. A horn winded in the glade, and a party of\nknights were seen approaching.\n\n\"To your arms!\" cried Robin, hurriedly seizing his sword and bow.\n\n\"'Tis Sir Richard of the Lea!\" cried another, as the troop came nearer.\n\nAnd so it was. Sir Richard spurred forward his horse and dashed up to\nthe camp while the outlaws stood at stiff attention. When he had come\nnear the spot where the Black Knight stood, he dismounted and knelt\nbefore him.\n\n\"I trust Your Majesty has not needed our arms before,\" he said humbly.\n\n\"It is the King!\" cried Will Scarlet, falling upon his knees.\n\n\"The King!\" echoed Robin Hood after a moment of dumb wonderment; and he\nand all his men bent reverently upon their knees, as one man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD AND MAID MARIAN WERE WED\n\n     \"Stand up again,\" then said the King,\n     \"I'll thee thy pardon give;\n     Stand up, my friend, who can contend,\n     When I give leave to live?\"\n\n     Then Robin Hood began a health\n     To Marian, his only dear,\n     And his yeomen all, both comely and tall,\n     Did quickly bring up the rear.\n\n\"Your pardon, sire!\" exclaimed Robin Hood. \"Pardon, from your royal\nbounty, for these my men who stand ready to serve you all your days!\"\n\nRichard of the Lion Heart looked grimly about over the kneeling band.\n\n\"Is it as your leader says?\" he asked.\n\n\"Aye, my lord King!\" burst from sevenscore throats at once.\n\n\"We be not outlaws from choice alone,\" continued Robin; \"but have\nbeen driven to outlawry through oppression. Grant us grace and royal\nprotection, and we will forsake the greenwood and follow the King.\"\n\nRichard's eyes sparkled as he looked from one to another of this\nstalwart band, and he thought within himself that here, indeed, was a\nroyal bodyguard worth the while.\n\n\"Swear!\" he said in his full rich voice; \"swear that you, Robin Hood,\nand all your men from this day henceforth will serve the King!\"\n\n\"We swear!\" came once more the answering shout from the yeomen.\n\n\"Arise, then,\" said King Richard. \"I give you all free pardon, and will\nspeedily put your service to the test. For I love such archers as you\nhave shown yourselves to be, and it were a sad pity to decree such men\nto death. England could not produce the like again, for many a day. But,\nin sooth, I cannot allow you to roam in the forest and shoot my deer;\nnor to take the law of the land into your own hands. Therefore, I now\nappoint you to be Royal Archers and mine own especial body-guard. There\nbe one or two civil matters to settle with certain Norman noblemen,\nin which I crave your aid. Thereafter, the half of your number, as\nmay later be determined, shall come back to these woodlands as Royal\nForesters. Mayhap you will show as much zeal in protecting my preserves\nas you have formerly shown in hunting them. Where, now, is that outlaw\nknown as Little John? Stand forth!\"\n\n\"Here, sire,\" quoth the giant, doffing his cap.\n\n\"Good master Little John,\" said the King, looking him over approvingly.\n\"Could your weak sinews stand the strain of an office in the shire? If\nso, you are this day Sheriff of Nottingham; and I trust you will make a\nbetter official than the man you relieve.\"\n\n\"I shall do my best, sire,\" said Little John, great astonishment and\ngladness in his heart.\n\n\"Master Scarlet, stand forth,\" said the King; and then addressing him:\n\"I have heard somewhat of your tale,\" quoth he, \"and that your father\nwas the friend of my father. Now, therefore, accept the royal pardon and\nresume the care of your family estates; for your father must be growing\nold. And come you to London next Court day and we shall see if there be\na knighthood vacant.\"\n\nLikewise the King called for Will Stutely and made him Chief of the\nRoyal Archers. Then he summoned Friar Tuck to draw near.\n\n\"I crave my King's pardon,\" said the priest, humbly enough; \"for who am\nI to lift my hand against the Lord's anointed?\"\n\n\"Nay, the Lord sent the smiter to thee without delay,\" returned Richard\nsmiling; \"and 'tis not for me to continue a quarrel between church and\nstate. So what can I do for you in payment of last night's hospitality?\nCan I find some fat living where there are no wicked to chastise, and\nwhere the work is easy and comfortable?\"\n\n\"Not so, my lord,\" replied Tuck. \"I wish only for peace in this life.\nMine is a simple nature and I care not for the fripperies and follies\nof court life. Give me a good meal and a cup of right brew, health, and\nenough for the day, and I ask no more.\"\n\nRichard sighed. \"You ask the greatest thing in the world,\nbrother--contentment. It is not mine to give or to deny. But ask your\nGod for it, an if belike he grant it, then ask it also in behalf of your\nKing.\" He glanced around once more at the foresters. \"Which one of you\nis Allan-a-Dale?\" he asked; and Allan came forward. \"So,\" said the King\nwith sober face, \"you are that errant minstrel who stole a bride at\nPlympton, despite her would-be groom and attending Bishop. I heard\nsomething of this in former days. Now what excuse have you to make?\"\n\n\"Only that I loved her, sire, and she loved me,\" said Allan, simply;\n\"and the Norman lord would have married her perforce, because of her\nlands.\"\n\n\"Which have since been forfeited by the Bishop of Hereford,\" added\nRichard. \"But my lord Bishop must disgorge them; and from tomorrow you\nand Mistress Dale are to return to them and live in peace and loyalty.\nAnd if ever I need your harp at Court, stand ready to attend me, and\nbring also the lady. Speaking of ladies,\" he continued, turning to Robin\nHood, who had stood silent, wondering if a special punishment was\nbeing reserved for him, \"did you not have a sweetheart who was once at\nCourt--one, Mistress Marian? What has become of her, that you should\nhave forgotten her?\"\n\n\"Nay, Your Majesty,\" said the black-eyed page coming forward blushingly;\n\"Robin has not forgotten me!\"\n\n\"So!\" said the King, bending to kiss her small hand in all gallantry.\n\"Verily, as I have already thought within myself, this Master Hood is\nbetter served than the King in his palace! But are you not the only\nchild of the late Earl of Huntingdon?\"\n\n\"I am, sire, though there be some who say that Robin Hood's father\nwas formerly the rightful Earl of Huntingdon. Nathless, neither he is\nadvantaged nor I, for the estates are confiscate.\"\n\n\"Then they shall be restored forthwith!\" cried the King; \"and lest you\ntwo should revive the ancient quarrel over them, I bestow them upon you\njointly. Come forward, Robin Hood.\"\n\nRobin came and knelt before his king. Richard drew his sword and touched\nhim upon the shoulder.\n\n\"Rise, Robin Fitzooth, Earl of Huntingdon!\" he exclaimed, while a mighty\ncheer arose from the band and rent the air of the forest. \"The first\ncommand I give you, my lord Earl,\" continued the King when quiet was\nrestored, \"is to marry Mistress Marian without delay.\"\n\n\"May I obey all Your Majesty's commands as willingly!\" cried the new\nEarl of Huntingdon, drawing the old Earl's daughter close to him. \"The\nceremony shall take place to-morrow, an this maid is willing.\"\n\n\"She makes little protest,\" said the King; \"so I shall e'en give away\nthe bride myself!\"\n\nThen the King chatted with others of the foresters, and made himself as\none of them for the evening, rejoicing that he could have this careless\nfreedom of the woods. And Much, the miller's son, and Arthur-a-Bland,\nand Middle, and Stutely and Scarlet and Little John and others played\nat the quarter-staff, giving and getting many lusty blows. Then as\nthe shades of night drew on, the whole company--knights and\nforesters--supped and drank around a blazing fire, while Allen sang\nsweetly to the thrumming of the harp, and the others joined in the\nchorus.\n\n'Twas a happy, care-free night--this last one together under the\ngreenwood tree. Robin could not help feeling an undertone of sadness\nthat it was to be the last; for the charm of the woodland was still upon\nhim. But he knew 'twas better so, and that the new life with Marian and\nin the service of his King would bring its own joys.\n\nThen the night deepened, the fire sank, but was replenished and the\ncompany lay down to rest. The King, at his own request, spent the night\nin the open. Thus they slept--King and subject alike--out under the\nstars, cared for lovingly by Nature, kind mother of us all.\n\nIn the morning the company was early astir and on their way to\nNottingham. It was a goodly cavalcade. First rode King Richard of the\nLion Heart, with his tall figure set forth by the black armor and waving\nplume in his helm. Then came Sir Richard of the Lea with fourscore\nknights and men-at-arms. And after them came Robin Hood and Maid Marian\nriding upon milk-white steeds. Allan-a-Dale also escorted Mistress Dale\non horseback, for she was to be matron-of-honor at the wedding. These\nwere followed by sevenscore archers clad in their bravest Lincoln green,\nand with their new bows unstrung in token of peace.\n\nOutside the gates of Nottingham town they were halted.\n\n\"Who comes here?\" asked the warder's surly voice.\n\n\"Open to the King of England!\" came back the clear answer, and the gates\nwere opened and the bridge let down without delay.\n\nAlmost before the company had crossed the moat the news spread through\nthe town like wildfire.\n\n\"The King is here! The King is here, and hath taken Robin Hood!\"\n\nFrom every corner flocked the people to see the company pass; and wildly\ndid they cheer for the King, who rode smilingly with bared head down\nthrough the market-place.\n\nAt the far end of it, he was met by the Sheriff who came up puffing in\nhis haste to do the King honor. He fairly turned green with rage when he\nsaw Sir Richard of the Lea and Robin Hood in the royal company, but made\nlow obeisance to his master.\n\n\"Sir Sheriff,\" quoth the King, \"I have come to rid the shire of outlaws,\naccording to my promise. There be none left, for all have now taken\nservice with their King. And lest there should be further outbreak,\nI have determined to place in charge of this shire a man who fears\nno other man in it. Master Little John is hereby created Sheriff of\nNottingham, and you will turn over the keys to him forthwith.\"\n\nThe Sheriff bowed, but dared utter no word. Then the King turned to the\nBishop of Hereford, who had also come up to pay his respects.\n\n\"Harkee, my lord Bishop,\" quoth he, \"the stench of your evil actions\nhad reached our nostrils. We shall demand strict accounting for certain\nseizures of the lands and certain acts of oppression which ill become a\nchurchman. But of this later. This afternoon you must officiate at the\nwedding of two of our company, in Nottingham Church. So make you ready.\"\n\nThe Bishop also bowed and departed, glad to escape a severer censure for\nthe time.\n\nThe company then rode on to the Mansion House, where the King held high\nlevee through all the noon hours, and the whole town made a holiday.\n\nIn the afternoon the way from the Mansion House to Nottingham Church was\nlined with cheering people, as the wedding party passed by. The famous\nbowmen were gazed at as curiously as though they had been wild animals,\nbut were cheered none the less. Robin who had long been held in secret\nliking was now doubly popular since he had the King's favor.\n\nAlong the way ahead of the King and the smiling bride and groom to be\nran little maids strewing flowers; while streamers floated in greeting\nfrom the windows. I ween, the only hearts that were not glad this day\nwere those of the old Sheriff, and of his proud daughter, who peered\nbetween the shutters of her window and was like to eat out her heart\nfrom envy and hatred.\n\nAt last the party reached the church, where the King dismounted lightly\nfrom his horse and helped the bride to alight; while Will Scarlet,\nthe best man, assisted Mistress Dale. Within the church they found\nthe Bishop robed in state, and by his side Friar Tuck who had been\nespecially deputed to assist.\n\nThe service was said in Latin, while the organ pealed forth softly. The\nKing gave away the bride, as he had said, and afterwards claimed first\nkiss for his pains. Then the happy party dispersed, and Robin and Marian\npassed out again through the portal, man and wife.\n\nOut through the cheering streets they fared, while the greenwood men ran\nahead and flung gold pennies right and left in their joy, and bade the\npeople drink the health of the young couple and the King. Then the\nwhole party took horse at Will Scarlet's earnest wish, and went down to\nGamewell Lodge, where the old Squire George wept for joy at seeing his\nson and the King and the wedding--party. That night they spent there,\nand feasted, and the next day, Sir Richard of the Lea claimed them.\n\nAnd thus, amid feasting and rejoicing and kingly favor, Robin Hood, the\nnew Earl of Huntingdon, and his bride began their wedded life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nHOW ROBIN HOOD MET HIS DEATH\n\n     \"Give me my bent bow in my hand,\n     And a broad arrow I'll let flee;\n     And where this arrow is taken up,\n     There shall my grave digg'd be.\"\n\nNow by good rights this story should end with the wedding of Robin Hood\nand Maid Marian; for do not many pleasant tales end with a wedding and\nthe saying, \"and they lived happy ever after.\"\n\nBut this is a true account--in so far as we can find the quaint old\nballads which tell of it--and so we must follow one more of these songs\nand learn how Robin, after living many years longer, at last came to\nseek his grave. And the story of it runs in this wise.\n\nRobin Hood and his men, now the Royal Archers, went with King Richard of\nthe Lion Heart through England settling certain private disputes which\nhad arisen among the Norman barons while the King was gone to the Holy\nLand. Then the King proceeded amid great pomp and rejoicing to the\npalace at London, and Robin, the new Earl of Huntingdon, brought his\nCountess thither, where she became one of the finest ladies of the\nCourt.\n\nThe Royal Archers were now divided into two bands, and one-half of them\nwere retained in London, while the other half returned to Sherwood and\nBarnesdale, there to guard the King's preserves.\n\nSeveral months passed by, and Robin began to chafe under the restraint\nof city life. He longed for the fresh pure air of the greenwood, and\nthe rollicking society of his yeomen. One day, upon seeing some lads\nat archery practice upon a green, he could not help but lament, saying,\n\"Woe is me! I fear my hand is fast losing its old time cunning at the\nbow-string!\"\n\nFinally he became so distraught that he asked leave to travel in foreign\nlands, and this was granted him. He took Maid Marian with him, and\ntogether they went through many strange countries. Finally in an Eastern\nland a great grief came upon Robin. Marian sickened of a plague and\ndied. They had been married but five years, and Robin felt as though all\nthe light had gone out of his life.\n\nHe wandered about the world for a few months longer, trying to forget\nhis grief, then came back to the court, at London, and sought some\ncommission in active service. But unluckily, Richard was gone again upon\nhis adventures, and Prince John, who acted as Regent, had never been\nfond of Robin. He received him with a sarcastic smile.\n\n\"Go forth into the greenwood,\" said he, coldly, \"and kill some more of\nthe King's deer. Belike, then, the King will make you Prime Minister, at\nthe very least, upon his return.\"\n\nThe taunt fired Robin's blood. He had been in a morose mood, ever since\nhis dear wife's death. He answered Prince John hotly, and the Prince\nbade his guards seize him and cast him into the Tower.\n\nAfter lying there for a few weeks, he was released by the faithful\nStutely and the remnant of the Royal Archers, and all together they fled\nthe city and made their way to the greenwood. There Robin blew the old\nfamiliar call, which all had known and loved so well. Up came running\nthe remainder of the band, who had been Royal Foresters, and when they\nsaw their old master they embraced his knees and kissed his hands, and\nfairly cried for joy that he had come again to them. And one and all\nforswore fealty to Prince John, and lived quietly with Robin in the\ngreenwood, doing harm to none and only awaiting the time when King\nRichard should come again.\n\nBut King Richard came not again, and would never need his Royal Guard\nmore. Tidings presently reached them, of how he had met his death in a\nforeign land, and how John reigned as King in his stead. The proof of\nthese events followed soon after, when there came striding through the\nglade the big, familiar form of Little John.\n\n\"Art come to arrest us?\" called out Robin, as he ran forward and\nembraced his old comrade.\n\n\"Nay, I am not come as the Sheriff of Nottingham, thanks be,\" answered\nLittle John. \"The new King has deposed me, and 'tis greatly to\nmy liking, for I have long desired to join you here again in the\ngreenwood.\"\n\nThen were the rest of the band right glad at this news, and toasted\nLittle John royally.\n\nThe new King waged fierce war upon the outlaws, soon after this, and\nsent so many scouting parties into Sherwood and Barnesdale that Robin\nand his men left these woods for a time and went into Derbyshire, near\nHaddon Hall. A curious pile of stone is shown to this day as the ruins\nof Robin's Castle, where the bold outlaw is believed to have defied his\nenemies for a year or more. At any rate King John found so many troubles\nof his own, after a time, that he ceased troubling the outlaws.\n\nBut in one of the last sorties Robin was wounded. The cut did not seem\nserious, and healed over the top; but it left a lurking fever. Daily his\nstrength ebbed away from him, until he was in sore distress.\n\nOne day as he rode along on horseback, near Kirklees Abbey, he was\nseized with so violent a rush of blood to the head that he reeled and\ncame near falling from his saddle. He dismounted weakly and knocked at\nthe Abbey gate. A woman shrouded in black peered forth.\n\n\"Who are you that knock here? For we allow no man within these walls,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Open, for the love of Heaven!\" he begged. \"I am Robin Hood, ill of a\nfever and in sore straits.\"\n\nAt the name of Robin Hood the woman started back, and then, as though\nbethinking herself, unbarred the door and admitted him. Assisting his\nfainting frame up a flight of stairs and into a front room, she loosed\nhis collar and bathed his face until he was revived. Then she spoke\nhurriedly in a low voice:\n\n\"Your fever will sink, if you are bled. See, I have provided a lancet\nand will open your veins, while you lie quiet.\"\n\nSo she bled him, and he fell into a stupor which lasted nearly all that\nday, so that he awoke weak and exhausted from loss of blood.\n\nNow there is a dispute as to this abbess who bled him. Some say that\nshe did it in all kindness of heart; while others aver that she was none\nother than the former Sheriff's daughter, and found her revenge at last\nin this cruel deed.\n\nBe that as it may, Robin's eyes swam from very weakness when he awoke.\n\nHe called wearily for help, but there was no response. He looked\nlongingly through the window at the green of the forest; but he was too\nweak to make the leap that would be needed to reach the ground.\n\n     He then bethought him of his horn,\n     Which hung down at his knee;\n     He set his horn unto his mouth,\n     And blew out weak blasts three.\n\nLittle John was out in the forest near by, or the blasts would never\nhave been heard. At their sound he sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Woe! woe!\" he cried, \"I fear my master is near dead, he blows so\nwearily!\"\n\nSo he made haste and came running up to the door of the abbey, and\nknocked loudly for admittance. Failing to get reply, he burst in the\ndoor with frenzied blows of his mighty fist, and soon came running up\nto the room where Robin lay, white and faint. \"Alas, dear master!\" cried\nLittle John in great distress; \"I fear you have met with treachery! If\nthat be so, grant me one last boon, I pray.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Robin.\n\n\"Let me burn Kirklees-Hall with fire, and all its nunnery.\"\n\n\"Nay, good comrade,\" answered Robin Hood gently, \"I cannot grant such\na boon. The dear Christ bade us forgive all our enemies. Moreover,\nyou know I never hurt woman in all my life; nor man when in woman's\ncompany.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and fell back, so that his friend thought him dying.\nThe great tears fell from the giant's eyes and wet his master's hand.\nRobin slowly rallied and seized his comrade's outstretched arm.\n\n\"Lift me up, good Little John,\" he said brokenly, \"I want to smell\nthe air from the good greenwood once again. Give me my good yew\nbow--here--here-and fix a broad arrow upon the string. Out yonder--among\nthe oaks--where this arrow shall fall--let them dig my grave.\"\n\nAnd with one last mighty effort he sped his shaft out of the open\nwindow, straight and true, as in the days of old, till it struck the\nlargest oak of them all and dropped in the shadow of the trees. Then he\nfell back upon the sobbing breast of his devoted friend.\n\n\"'Tis the last!\" he murmured, \"tell the brave hearts to lay me there\nwith the green sod under my head and feet. And--let them lay--my bent\nbow at my side, for it has made sweet music in mine ears.\"\n\nHe rested a moment, and Little John scarce knew that he was alive. But\non a sudden Robin's eye brightened, and he seemed to think himself back\nonce more with the band in the open forest glade. He struggled to rise.\n\n\"Ha! 'tis a fine stag, Will! And Allan, thou never didst thrum the harp\nmore sweetly. How the light blazes! And Marian!--'tis my Marian--come at\nlast!\"\n\nSo died the body of Robin Hood; but his spirit lives on through the\ncenturies in the deathless ballads which are sung of him, and in the\nhearts of men who love freedom and chivalry.\n\nThey buried him where his last arrow had fallen, and they set a stone to\nmark the spot. And on the stone were graven these words:\n\n     \"Here underneath his little stone\n     Lies Robert, Earl of Huntingdon;\n     Never archer as he so good,\n     And people called him Robin Hood.\n     Such outlaws as he and his men\n     Will England never see again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Robin Hood, by J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
