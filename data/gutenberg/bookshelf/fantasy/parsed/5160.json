In it the plot, the\nincidents, the characters, were almost wholly those of Chivalry, that\nbond which united the warriors of France, Spain, and Italy, with\nthose of pure Teutonic descent, and embraced more or less firmly all\nthe nations of Europe, excepting only the Slavonic races, not yet\nrisen to power, and the Celts, who had fallen from it.  It is not\ndifficult to account for this latter omission.  The Celts, driven\nfrom the plains into the mountains and islands, preserved their\nliberty, and hated their oppressors with fierce, and not causeless,\nhatred.  A proud and free people, isolated both in country and\nlanguage, were not likely to adopt customs which implied brotherhood\nwith their foes.\n\nSuch being the case, it is remarkable that when the chief romances\nare examined, the name of many of the heroes and their scenes of\naction are found to be Celtic, and those of persons and places famous\nin the traditions of Wales and Brittany.  Of this the romances of\nYwaine and Gawaine, Sir Perceval de Galles, Eric and Enide, Mort\nd'Arthur, Sir Lancelot, Sir Tristan, the Graal, &c., may be cited as\nexamples.  In some cases a tendency to triads, and other matters of\ninternal evidence, point in the same direction.\n\nIt may seem difficult to account for this.  Although the ancient\ndominion of the Celts over Europe is not without enduring evidence in\nthe names of the mountains and streams, the great features of a\ncountry, yet the loss of their prior language by the great mass of\nthe Celtic nations in Southern Europe (if indeed their successors in\nterritory be at all of their blood), prevents us from clearly seeing,\nand makes us wonder, how stories, originally embodied in the Celtic\ndialects of Great Britain and France, could so influence the\nliterature of nations to whom the Celtic languages were utterly\nunknown.  Whence then came these internal marks, and these proper\nnames of persons and places, the features of a story usually of\nearliest date and least likely to change?\n\nThese romances were found in England, France, Germany, Norway,\nSweden, and even Iceland, as early as the beginning of the thirteenth\nand end of the twelfth century.  The Germans, who propagated them\nthrough the nations of the North, derived them certainly from France.\nRobert Wace published his Anglo-Norman Romance of the Brut\nd'Angleterre about 1155.  Sir Tristan was written in French prose in\n1170; and The Chevalier au Lion, Chevalier de l'Epee, and Sir\nLancelot du Lac, in metrical French, by Chrestien de Troyes, before\n1200.\n\nFrom these facts it is to be argued that the further back these\nromances are traced, the more clearly does it appear that they spread\nover the Continent from the North-west of France.  The older\nversions, it may be remarked, are far more simple than the later\ncorruptions.  In them there is less allusion to the habits and usages\nof Chivalry, and the Welsh names and elements stand out in stronger\nrelief.  It is a great step to be able to trace the stocks of these\nromances back to Wace, or to his country and age.  For Wace's work\nwas not original.  He himself, a native of Jersey, appears to have\nderived much of it from the \"Historia Britonum\" of Gruffydd ab\nArthur, commonly known as \"Geoffrey of Monmouth,\" born 1128, who\nhimself professes to have translated from a British original.  It is,\nhowever, very possible that Wace may have had access, like Geoffrey,\nto independent sources of information.\n\nTo the claims set up on behalf of Wace and Geoffrey, to be regarded\nas the channels by which the Cymric tales passed into the Continental\nRomance, may be added those of a third almost contemporary author.\nLayamon, a Saxon priest, dwelling, about 1200, upon the banks of the\nupper Severn, acknowledges for the source of his British history, the\nEnglish Bede, the Latin Albin, and the French Wace.  The last-named\nhowever is by very much his chief, and, for Welsh matters, his only\navowed authority.  His book, nevertheless, contains a number of names\nand stories relating to Wales, of which no traces appear in Wace, or\nindeed in Geoffrey, but which he was certainly in a very favourable\nposition to obtain for himself.  Layamon, therefore, not only\nconfirms Geoffrey in some points, but it is clear, that, professing\nto follow Wace, he had independent access to the great body of Welsh\nliterature then current.  Sir F. Madden has put this matter very\nclearly, in his recent edition of Layamon.  The Abbe de la Rue, also,\nwas of opinion that Gaimar, an Anglo-Norman, in the reign of Stephen,\nusually regarded as a translator of Geoffrey of Monmouth, had access\nto a Welsh independent authority.\n\nIn addition to these, is to be mentioned the English version of Sir\nTristrem, which Sir Walter Scott considered to be derived from a\ndistinct Celtic source, and not, like the later Amadis, Palmerin, and\nLord Berners's Canon of Romance, imported into English literature by\ntranslation from the French.  For the Auntours of Arthur, recently\npublished by the Camden Society, their Editor, Mr. Robson, seems to\nhint at a similar claim.\n\nHere then are various known channels, by which portions of Welsh and\nArmoric fiction crossed the Celtic border, and gave rise to the more\nornate, and widely-spread romance of the Age of Chivalry.  It is not\nimprobable that there may have existed many others.  It appears then\nthat a large portion of the stocks of Mediaeval Romance proceeded\nfrom Wales.  We have next to see in what condition they are still\nfound in that country.\n\nThat Wales possessed an ancient literature, containing various lyric\ncompositions, and certain triads, in which are arranged historical\nfacts or moral aphorisms, has been shown by Sharon Turner, who has\nestablished the high antiquity of many of these compositions.\n\nThe more strictly Romantic Literature of Wales has been less\nfortunate, though not less deserving of critical attention.  Small\nportions only of it have hitherto appeared in print, the remainder\nbeing still hidden in the obscurity of ancient Manuscripts:  of these\nthe chief is supposed to be the Red Book of Hergest, now in the\nLibrary of Jesus College, Oxford, and of the fourteenth century.\nThis contains, besides poems, the prose romances known as Mabinogion.\nThe Black Book of Caermarthen, preserved at Hengwrt, and considered\nnot to be of later date than the twelfth century, is said to contain\npoems only. {1}\n\nThe Mabinogion, however, though thus early recorded in the Welsh\ntongue, are in their existing form by no means wholly Welsh.  They\nare of two tolerably distinct classes.  Of these, the older contains\nfew allusions to Norman customs, manners, arts, arms, and luxuries.\nThe other, and less ancient, are full of such allusions, and of\necclesiastical terms.  Both classes, no doubt, are equally of Welsh\nroot, but the former are not more overlaid or corrupted, than might\nhave been expected, from the communication that so early took place\nbetween the Normans and the Welsh; whereas the latter probably\nmigrated from Wales, and were brought back and re-translated after an\nabsence of centuries, with a load of Norman additions.  Kilhwch and\nOlwen, and the dream of Rhonabwy, may be cited as examples of the\nolder and purer class; the Lady of the Fountain, Peredur, and Geraint\nab Erbin, of the later, or decorated.\n\nBesides these, indeed, there are a few tales, as Amlyn and Amic, Sir\nBevis of Hamtoun, the Seven Wise Masters, and the story of\nCharlemagne, so obviously of foreign extraction, and of late\nintroduction into Wales, not presenting even a Welsh name, or\nallusion, and of such very slender intrinsic merit, that although\ncomprised in the Llyvr Coch, they have not a shadow of claim to form\npart of the Canon of Welsh Romance.  Therefore, although I have\ntranslated and examined them, I have given them no place in these\nvolumes.\n\nThere is one argument in favour of the high antiquity in Wales of\nmany of the Mabinogion, which deserves to be mentioned here.  This\nargument is founded on the topography of the country.  It is found\nthat Saxon names of places are very frequently definitions of the\nnature of the locality to which they are attached, as Clifton,\nDeepden, Bridge-ford, Thorpe, Ham, Wick, and the like; whereas those\nof Wales are more frequently commemorative of some event, real or\nsupposed, said to have happened on or near the spot, or bearing\nallusion to some person renowned in the story of the country or\ndistrict.  Such are \"Llyn y Morwynion,\" the Lake of the Maidens;\n\"Rhyd y Bedd,\" the Ford of the Grave; \"Bryn Cyfergyr,\" the Hill of\nAssault; and so on.  But as these names could not have preceded the\nevents to which they refer, the events themselves must be not\nunfrequently as old as the early settlement in the country.  And as\nsome of these events and fictions are the subjects of, and are\nexplained by, existing Welsh legends, it follows that the legends\nmust be, in some shape or other, of very remote antiquity.  It will\nbe observed that this argument supports REMOTE antiquity only for\nsuch legends as are connected with the greater topographical\nfeatures, as mountains, lakes, rivers, seas, which must have been\nnamed at an early period in the inhabitation of the country by man.\nBut there exist, also, legends connected with the lesser features, as\npools, hills, detached rocks, caves, fords, and the like, places not\nnecessarily named by the earlier settlers, but the names of which\nare, nevertheless, probably very old, since the words of which they\nare composed are in many cases not retained in the colloquial tongue,\nin which they must once have been included, and are in some instances\nlost from the language altogether, so much so as to be only partially\nexplicable even by scholars.  The argument applies likewise, in their\ndegree, to camps, barrows, and other artificial earth-works.\n\nConclusions thus drawn, when established, rest upon a very firm\nbasis.  They depend upon the number and appositeness of the facts,\nand it would be very interesting to pursue this branch of evidence in\ndetail.  In following up this idea, the names to be sought for might\nthus be classed:-\n\nI.  Names of the great features, involving proper names and actions.\n\nCadair Idris and Cadair Arthur both involve more than a mere name.\nIdris and Arthur must have been invested with heroic qualifications\nto have been placed in such \"seats.\"\n\nII.  Names of lesser features, as \"Bryn y Saeth,\" Hill of the Dart;\n\"Llyn Llyngclys,\" Lake of the Engulphed Court; \"Ceven y Bedd,\" the\nRidge of the Grave; \"Rhyd y Saeson,\" the Saxons' Ford.\n\nIII.  Names of mixed natural and artificial objects, as \"Coeten\nArthur,\" Arthur's Coit; \"Cerrig y Drudion,\" the Crag of the Heroes;\nwhich involve actions.  And such as embody proper names only, as\n\"Cerrig Howell,\" the Crag of Howell; \"Caer Arianrod,\" the Camp of\nArianrod; \"Bron Goronwy,\" the Breast (of the Hill) of Goronwy;\n\"Castell mab Wynion,\" the Castle of the son of Wynion; \"Nant\nGwrtheyrn,\" the Rill of Vortigern.\n\nThe selection of names would demand much care and discretion.  The\ntranslations should be indisputable, and, where known, the connexion\nof a name with a legend should be noted.  Such a name as \"Mochdrev,\"\nSwine-town, would be valueless unless accompanied by a legend.\n\nIt is always valuable to find a place or work called after an\nindividual, because it may help to support some tradition of his\nexistence or his actions.  But it is requisite that care be taken not\nto push the etymological dissection too far.  Thus, \"Caer Arianrod\"\nshould be taken simply as the \"Camp of Arianrod,\" and not rendered\nthe \"Camp of the silver circle,\" because the latter, though it might\npossibly have something to do with the reason for which the name was\nborne by Arianrod herself, had clearly no reference to its\napplication to her camp.\n\nIt appears to me, then, looking back upon what has been advanced:-\n\nI.  That we have throughout Europe, at an early period, a great body\nof literature, known as Mediaeval Romance, which, amidst much that is\nwholly of Teutonic origin and character, includes certain well-marked\ntraces of an older Celtic nucleus.\n\nII.  Proceeding backwards in time, we find these romances, their\nornaments falling away at each step, existing towards the twelfth\ncentury, of simpler structure, and with less encumbered Celtic\nfeatures, in the works of Wace, and other Bards of the Langue d'Oil.\n\nIII.  We find that Geoffrey of Monmouth, Layamon, and other early\nBritish and Anglo-Saxon historians, and minstrels, on the one hand,\ntransmitted to Europe the rudiments of its after romance, much of\nwhich, on the other hand, they drew from Wales.\n\nIV.  Crossing into Wales we find, in the Mabinogion, the evident\ncounterpart of the Celtic portion of the continental romance, mixed\nup, indeed, with various reflex additions from beyond the border, but\nstill containing ample internal evidence of a Welsh original.\n\nV.  Looking at the connexion between divers of the more ancient\nMabinogion, and the topographical nomenclature of part of the\ncountry, we find evidence of the great, though indefinite, antiquity\nof these tales, and of an origin, which, if not indigenous, is\ncertainly derived from no European nation.\n\nIt was with a general belief in some of these conclusions, that I\ncommenced my labours, and I end them with my impressions strongly\nconfirmed.  The subject is one not unworthy of the talents of a Llwyd\nor a Prichard.  It might, I think, be shown, by pursuing the inquiry,\nthat the Cymric nation is not only, as Dr. Prichard has proved it to\nbe, an early offshoot of the Indo-European family, and a people of\nunmixed descent, but that when driven out of their conquests by the\nlater nations, the names and exploits of their heroes, and the\ncompositions of their bards, spread far and wide among the invaders,\nand affected intimately their tastes and literature for many\ncenturies, and that it has strong claims to be considered the cradle\nof European Romance.\n\nC. E. G.\nDOWLAIS, August 29th, 1848.\n\n\n\nTHE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN\n\n\n\nKing Arthur was at Caerlleon upon Usk; and one day he sat in his\nchamber; and with him were Owain the son of Urien, and Kynon the son\nof Clydno, and Kai the son of Kyner; and Gwenhwyvar and her\nhandmaidens at needlework by the window.  And if it should be said\nthat there was a porter at Arthur's palace, there was none.  Glewlwyd\nGavaelvawr was there, acting as porter, to welcome guests and\nstrangers, and to receive them with honour, and to inform them of the\nmanners and customs of the Court; and to direct those who came to the\nHall or to the presence-chamber, and those who came to take up their\nlodging.\n\nIn the centre of the chamber King Arthur sat upon a seat of green\nrushes, over which was spread a covering of flame-coloured satin, and\na cushion of red satin was under his elbow.\n\nThen Arthur spoke, \"If I thought you would not disparage me,\" said\nhe, \"I would sleep while I wait for my repast; and you can entertain\none another with relating tales, and can obtain a flagon of mead and\nsome meat from Kai.\"  And the King went to sleep.  And Kynon the son\nof Clydno asked Kai for that which Arthur had promised them.  \"I,\ntoo, will have the good tale which he promised to me,\" said Kai.\n\"Nay,\" answered Kynon, \"fairer will it be for thee to fulfill\nArthur's behest, in the first place, and then we will tell thee the\nbest tale that we know.\"  So Kai went to the kitchen and to the mead-\ncellar, and returned bearing a flagon of mead and a golden goblet,\nand a handful of skewers, upon which were broiled collops of meat.\nThen they ate the collops and began to drink the mead.  \"Now,\" said\nKai, \"it is time for you to give me my story.\"  \"Kynon,\" said Owain,\n\"do thou pay to Kai the tale that is his due.\"  \"Truly,\" said Kynon,\n\"thou are older, and art a better teller of tales, and hast seen more\nmarvellous things than I; do thou therefore pay Kai his tale.\"\n\"Begin thyself,\" quoth Owain, \"with the best that thou knowest.\"  \"I\nwill do so,\" answered Kynon.\n\n\"I was the only son of my mother and father, and I was exceedingly\naspiring, and my daring was very great.  I thought there was no\nenterprise in the world too mighty for me, and after I had achieved\nall the adventures that were in my own country, I equipped myself,\nand set forth to journey through deserts and distant regions.  And at\nlength it chanced that I came to the fairest valley in the world,\nwherein were trees of equal growth; and a river ran through the\nvalley, and a path was by the side of the river.  And I followed the\npath until mid-day, and continued my journey along the remainder of\nthe valley until the evening; and at the extremity of a plain I came\nto a large and lustrous Castle, at the foot of which was a torrent.\nAnd I approached the Castle, and there I beheld two youths with\nyellow curling hair, each with a frontlet of gold upon his head, and\nclad in a garment of yellow satin, and they had gold clasps upon\ntheir insteps.  In the hand of each of them was an ivory bow, strung\nwith the sinews of the stag; and their arrows had shafts of the bone\nof the whale, and were winged with peacock's feathers; the shafts\nalso had golden heads.  And they had daggers with blades of gold, and\nwith hilts of the bone of the whale.  And they were shooting their\ndaggers.\n\n\"And a little way from them I saw a man in the prime of life, with\nhis beard newly shorn, clad in a robe and a mantle of yellow satin;\nand round the top of his mantle was a band of gold lace.  On his feet\nwere shoes of variegated leather, fastened by two bosses of gold.\nWhen I saw him, I went towards him and saluted him, and such was his\ncourtesy that he no sooner received my greeting than he returned it.\nAnd he went with me towards the Castle.  Now there were no dwellers\nin the Castle except those who were in one hall.  And there I saw\nfour-and-twenty damsels, embroidering satin at a window.  And this I\ntell thee, Kai, that the least fair of them was fairer than the\nfairest maid thou hast ever beheld in the Island of Britain, and the\nleast lovely of them was more lovely than Gwenhwyvar, the wife of\nArthur, when she has appeared loveliest at the Offering, on the day\nof the Nativity, or at the feast of Easter.  They rose up at my\ncoming, and six of them took my horse, and divested me of my armour;\nand six others took my arms, and washed them in a vessel until they\nwere perfectly bright.  And the third six spread cloths upon the\ntables and prepared meat.  And the fourth six took off my soiled\ngarments, and placed others upon me; namely, an under-vest and a\ndoublet of fine linen, and a robe, and a surcoat, and a mantle of\nyellow satin with a broad gold band upon the mantle.  And they placed\ncushions both beneath and around me, with coverings of red linen; and\nI sat down.  Now the six maidens who had taken my horse, unharnessed\nhim, as well as if they had been the best squires in the Island of\nBritain.  Then, behold, they brought bowls of silver wherein was\nwater to wash, and towels of linen, some green and some white; and I\nwashed.  And in a little while the man sat down to the table.  And I\nsat next to him, and below me sat all the maidens, except those who\nwaited on us.  And the table was of silver, and the cloths upon the\ntable were of linen; and no vessel was served upon the table that was\nnot either of gold or of silver, or of buffalo-horn.  And our meat\nwas brought to us.  And verily, Kai, I saw there every sort of meat\nand every sort of liquor that I have ever seen elsewhere; but the\nmeat and the liquor were better served there than I have ever seen\nthem in any other place.\n\n\"Until the repast was half over, neither the man nor any one of the\ndamsels spoke a single word to me; but when the man perceived that it\nwould be more agreeable to me to converse than to eat any more, he\nbegan to inquire of me who I was.  I said I was glad to find that\nthere was some one who would discourse with me, and that it was not\nconsidered so great a crime at that Court for people to hold converse\ntogether. 'Chieftain,' said the man, 'we would have talked to thee\nsooner, but we feared to disturb thee during thy repast; now,\nhowever, we will discourse.'  Then I told the man who I was, and what\nwas the cause of my journey; and said that I was seeking whether any\none was superior to me, or whether I could gain the mastery over all.\nThe man looked upon me, and he smiled and said, 'If I did not fear to\ndistress thee too much, I would show thee that which thou seekest.'\nUpon this I became anxious and sorrowful, and when the man perceived\nit, he said, 'If thou wouldest rather that I should show thee thy\ndisadvantage than thine advantage, I will do so.  Sleep here to-\nnight, and in the morning arise early, and take the road upwards\nthrough the valley until thou reachest the wood through which thou\ncamest hither.  A little way within the wood thou wilt meet with a\nroad branching off to the right, by which thou must proceed, until\nthou comest to a large sheltered glade with a mound in the centre.\nAnd thou wilt see a black man of great stature on the top of the\nmound.  He is not smaller in size than two of the men of this world.\nHe has but one foot; and one eye in the middle of his forehead.  And\nhe has a club of iron, and it is certain that there are no two men in\nthe world who would not find their burden in that club.  And he is\nnot a comely man, but on the contrary he is exceedingly ill-favoured;\nand he is the woodward of that wood.  And thou wilt see a thousand\nwild animals grazing around him.  Inquire of him the way out of the\nglade, and he will reply to thee briefly, and will point out the road\nby which thou shalt find that which thou art in quest of.'\n\n\"And long seemed that night to me.  And the next morning I arose and\nequipped myself, and mounted my horse, and proceeded straight through\nthe valley to the wood; and I followed the cross-road which the man\nhad pointed out to me, till at length I arrived at the glade.  And\nthere was I three times more astonished at the number of wild animals\nthat I beheld, than the man had said I should be.  And the black man\nwas there, sitting upon the top of the mound.  Huge of stature as the\nman had told me that he was, I found him to exceed by far the\ndescription he had given me of him.  As for the iron club which the\nman had told me was a burden for two men, I am certain, Kai, that it\nwould be a heavy weight for four warriors to lift; and this was in\nthe black man's hand.  And he only spoke to me in answer to my\nquestions.  Then I asked him what power he held over those animals.\n'I will show thee, little man,' said he.  And he took his club in his\nhand, and with it he struck a stag a great blow so that he brayed\nvehemently, and at his braying the animals came together, as numerous\nas the stars in the sky, so that it was difficult for me to find room\nin the glade to stand among them.  There were serpents, and dragons,\nand divers sorts of animals.  And he looked at them, and bade them go\nand feed; and they bowed their heads, and did him homage as vassals\nto their lord.\n\n\"Then the black man said to me, 'Seest thou now, little man, what\npower I hold over these animals?'  Then I inquired of him the way,\nand he became very rough in his manner to me; however, he asked me\nwhither I would go?  And when I told him who I was and what I sought,\nhe directed me.  'Take,' said he, 'that path that leads towards the\nhead of the glade, and ascend the wooded steep until thou comest to\nits summit; and there thou wilt find an open space like to a large\nvalley, and in the midst of it a tall tree, whose branches are\ngreener than the greenest pine-trees.  Under this tree is a fountain,\nand by the side of the fountain a marble slab, and on the marble slab\na silver bowl, attached by a chain of silver, so that it may not be\ncarried away.  Take the bowl and throw a bowlful of water upon the\nslab, and thou wilt hear a mighty peal of thunder, so that thou wilt\nthink that heaven and earth are trembling with its fury.  With the\nthunder there will come a shower so severe that it will be scarce\npossible for thee to endure it and live.  And the shower will be of\nhailstones; and after the shower, the weather will become fair, but\nevery leaf that was upon the tree will have been carried away by the\nshower.  Then a flight of birds will come and alight upon the tree;\nand in thine own country thou didst never hear a strain so sweet as\nthat which they will sing.  And at the moment thou art most delighted\nwith the song of the birds, thou wilt hear a murmuring and\ncomplaining coming towards thee along the valley.  And thou wilt see\na knight upon a coal-black horse, clothed in black velvet, and with a\npennon of black linen upon his lance; and he will ride unto thee to\nencounter thee with the utmost speed.  If thou fleest from him he\nwill overtake thee, and if thou abidest there, as sure as thou art a\nmounted knight, he will leave thee on foot.  And if thou dost not\nfind trouble in that adventure, thou needest not seek it during the\nrest of thy life.'\n\n\"So I journeyed on, until I reached the summit of the steep, and\nthere I found everything as the black man had described it to me.\nAnd I went up to the tree, and beneath it I saw the fountain, and by\nits side the marble slab, and the silver bowl fastened by the chain.\nThen I took the bowl, and cast a bowlful of water upon the slab; and\nthereupon, behold, the thunder came, much more violent than the black\nman had led me to expect; and after the thunder came the shower; and\nof a truth I tell thee, Kai, that there is neither man nor beast that\ncan endure that shower and live.  For not one of those hailstones\nwould be stopped, either by the flesh or by the skin, until it had\nreached the bone.  I turned my horse's flank towards the shower, and\nplaced the beak of my shield over his head and neck, while I held the\nupper part of it over my own head.  And thus I withstood the shower.\nWhen I looked on the tree there was not a single leaf upon it, and\nthen the sky became clear, and with that, behold the birds lighted\nupon the tree, and sang.  And truly, Kai, I never heard any melody\nequal to that, either before or since.  And when I was most charmed\nwith listening to the birds, lo, a murmuring voice was heard through\nthe valley, approaching me and saying, 'Oh, Knight, what has brought\nthee hither?  What evil have I done to thee, that thou shouldst act\ntowards me and my possessions as thou hast this day?  Dost thou not\nknow that the shower to-day has left in my dominions neither man nor\nbeast alive that was exposed to it?'  And thereupon, behold, a Knight\non a black horse appeared, clothed in jet-black velvet, and with a\ntabard of black linen about him.  And we charged each other, and, as\nthe onset was furious, it was not long before I was overthrown.  Then\nthe Knight passed the shaft of his lance through the bridle rein of\nmy horse, and rode off with the two horses, leaving me where I was.\nAnd he did not even bestow so much notice upon me as to imprison me,\nnor did he despoil me of my arms.  So I returned along the road by\nwhich I had come.  And when I reached the glade where the black man\nwas, I confess to thee, Kai, it is a marvel that I did not melt down\ninto a liquid pool, through the shame that I felt at the black man's\nderision.  And that night I came to the same castle where I had spent\nthe night preceding.  And I was more agreeably entertained that night\nthan I had been the night before; and I was better feasted, and I\nconversed freely with the inmates of the castle, and none of them\nalluded to my expedition to the fountain, neither did I mention it to\nany; and I remained there that night.  When I arose on the morrow, I\nfound, ready saddled, a dark bay palfrey, with nostrils as red as\nscarlet; and after putting on my armour, and leaving there my\nblessing, I returned to my own Court.  And that horse I still\npossess, and he is in the stable yonder.  And I declare that I would\nnot part with him for the best palfrey in the Island of Britain.\n\n\"Now of a truth, Kai, no man ever before confessed to an adventure so\nmuch to his own discredit, and verily it seems strange to me, that\nneither before nor since have I heard of any person besides myself\nwho knew of this adventure, and that the subject of it should exist\nwithin King Arthur's dominions, without any other person lighting\nupon it.\"\n\n\"Now,\" quoth Owain, \"would it not be well to go and endeavour to\ndiscover that place?\"\n\n\"By the hand of my friend,\" said Kai, \"often dost thou utter that\nwith thy tongue which thou wouldst not make good with thy deeds.\"\n\n\"In very truth,\" said Gwenhwyvar, \"it were better thou wert hanged,\nKai, than to use such uncourteous speech towards a man like Owain.\"\n\n\"By the hand of my friend, good Lady,\" said Kai, \"thy praise of Owain\nis not greater than mine.\"\n\nWith that Arthur awoke, and asked if he had not been sleeping a\nlittle.\n\n\"Yes, Lord,\" answered Owain, \"thou hast slept awhile.\"\n\n\"Is it time for us to go to meat?\"\n\n\"It is, Lord,\" said Owain.\n\nThen the horn for washing was sounded, and the King and all his\nhousehold sat down to eat.  And when the meal was ended, Owain\nwithdrew to his lodging, and made ready his horse and his arms.\n\nOn the morrow, with the dawn of day, he put on his armour, and\nmounted his charger, and travelled through distant lands and over\ndesert mountains.  And at length he arrived at the valley which Kynon\nhad described to him; and he was certain that it was the same that he\nsought.  And journeying along the valley by the side of the river, he\nfollowed its course till he came to the plain and within sight of the\nCastle.  When he approached the Castle, he saw the youths shooting\ntheir daggers in the place where Kynon had seen them, and the yellow\nman, to whom the Castle belonged, standing hard by.  And no sooner\nhad Owain saluted the yellow man than he was saluted by him in\nreturn.\n\nAnd he went forward towards the Castle, and there he saw the chamber,\nand when he had entered the chamber he beheld the maidens working at\nsatin embroidery, in chairs of gold.  And their beauty and their\ncomeliness seemed to Owain far greater than Kynon had represented to\nhim.  And they rose to wait upon Owain, as they had done to Kynon,\nand the meal which they set before him gave more satisfaction to\nOwain than it had done to Kynon.\n\nAbout the middle of the repast, the yellow man asked Owain the object\nof his journey.  And Owain made it known to him, and said, \"I am in\nquest of the Knight who guards the fountain.\"  Upon this the yellow\nman smiled, and said that he was as loth to point out that adventure\nto Owain as he had been to Kynon.  However, he described the whole to\nOwain, and they retired to rest.\n\nThe next morning Owain found his horse made ready for him by the\ndamsels, and he set forward and came to the glade where the black man\nwas.  And the stature of the black man seemed more wonderful to Owain\nthan it had done to Kynon, and Owain asked of him his road, and he\nshowed it to him.  And Owain followed the road, as Kynon had done,\ntill he came to the green tree; and he beheld the fountain, and the\nslab beside the fountain, with the bowl upon it.  And Owain took the\nbowl, and threw a bowlful of water upon the slab.  And, lo, the\nthunder was heard, and after the thunder came the shower, much more\nviolent than Kynon had described, and after the shower the sky became\nbright.  And when Owain looked at the tree, there was not one leaf\nupon it.  And immediately the birds came, and settled upon the tree,\nand sang.  And when their song was most pleasing to Owain, he beheld\na Knight coming towards him through the valley, and he prepared to\nreceive him; and encountered him violently.  Having broken both their\nlances, they drew their swords, and fought blade to blade.  Then\nOwain struck the Knight a blow through his helmet, head-piece and\nvisor, and through the skin, and the flesh, and the bone, until it\nwounded the very brain.  Then the black Knight felt that he had\nreceived a mortal wound, upon which he turned his horse's head, and\nfled.  And Owain pursued him, and followed close upon him, although\nhe was not near enough to strike him with his sword.  Thereupon Owain\ndescried a vast and resplendent Castle.  And they came to the Castle\ngate.  And the black Knight was allowed to enter, and the portcullis\nwas let fall upon Owain; and it struck his horse behind the saddle,\nand cut him in two, and carried away the rowels of the spurs that\nwere upon Owain's heels.  And the portcullis descended to the floor.\nAnd the rowels of the spurs and part of the horse were without, and\nOwain with the other part of the horse remained between the two\ngates, and the inner gate was closed, so that Owain could not go\nthence; and Owain was in a perplexing situation.  And while he was in\nthis state, he could see through an aperture in the gate, a street\nfacing him, with a row of houses on each side.  And he beheld a\nmaiden, with yellow curling hair, and a frontlet of gold upon her\nhead; and she was clad in a dress of yellow satin, and on her feet\nwere shoes of variegated leather.  And she approached the gate, and\ndesired that it should be opened.  \"Heaven knows, Lady,\" said Owain,\n\"it is no more possible for me to open to thee from hence, than it is\nfor thee to set me free.\"  \"Truly,\" said the damsel, \"it is very sad\nthat thou canst not be released, and every woman ought to succour\nthee, for I never saw one more faithful in the service of ladies than\nthou.  As a friend thou art the most sincere, and as a lover the most\ndevoted.  Therefore,\" quoth she, \"whatever is in my power to do for\nthy release, I will do it.  Take this ring and put it on thy finger,\nwith the stone inside thy hand; and close thy hand upon the stone.\nAnd as long as thou concealest it, it will conceal thee.  When they\nhave consulted together, they will come forth to fetch thee, in order\nto put thee to death; and they will be much grieved that they cannot\nfind thee.  And I will await thee on the horseblock yonder; and thou\nwilt be able to see me, though I cannot see thee; therefore come and\nplace thy hand upon my shoulder, that I may know that thou art near\nme.  And by the way that I go hence, do thou accompany me.\"\n\nThen she went away from Owain, and he did all that the maiden had\ntold him.  And the people of the Castle came to seek Owain, to put\nhim to death, and when they found nothing but the half of his horse,\nthey were sorely grieved.\n\nAnd Owain vanished from among them, and went to the maiden, and\nplaced his hand upon her shoulder; whereupon she set off, and Owain\nfollowed her, until they came to the door of a large and beautiful\nchamber, and the maiden opened it, and they went in, and closed the\ndoor.  And Owain looked around the chamber, and behold there was not\neven a single nail in it that was not painted with gorgeous colours;\nand there was not a single panel that had not sundry images in gold\nportrayed upon it.\n\nThe maiden kindled a fire, and took water in a silver bowl, and put a\ntowel of white linen on her shoulder, and gave Owain water to wash.\nThen she placed before him a silver table, inlaid with gold; upon\nwhich was a cloth of yellow linen; and she brought him food.  And of\na truth, Owain had never seen any kind of meat that was not there in\nabundance, but it was better cooked there than he had ever found it\nin any other place.  Nor did he ever see so excellent a display of\nmeat and drink, as there.  And there was not one vessel from which he\nwas served, that was not of gold or of silver.  And Owain ate and\ndrank, until late in the afternoon, when lo, they heard a mighty\nclamour in the Castle; and Owain asked the maiden what that outcry\nwas.  \"They are administering extreme unction,\" said she, \"to the\nNobleman who owns the Castle.\"  And Owain went to sleep.\n\nThe couch which the maiden had prepared for him was meet for Arthur\nhimself; it was of scarlet, and fur, and satin, and sendal, and fine\nlinen.  In the middle of the night they heard a woful outcry.  \"What\noutcry again is this?\" said Owain.  \"The Nobleman who owned the\nCastle is now dead,\" said the maiden.  And a little after daybreak,\nthey heard an exceeding loud clamour and wailing.  And Owain asked\nthe maiden what was the cause of it.  \"They are bearing to the church\nthe body of the Nobleman who owned the Castle.\"\n\nAnd Owain rose up, and clothed himself, and opened a window of the\nchamber, and looked towards the Castle; and he could see neither the\nbounds, nor the extent of the hosts that filled the streets.  And\nthey were fully armed; and a vast number of women were with them,\nboth on horseback and on foot; and all the ecclesiastics in the city,\nsinging.  And it seemed to Owain that the sky resounded with the\nvehemence of their cries, and with the noise of the trumpets, and\nwith the singing of the ecclesiastics.  In the midst of the throng,\nhe beheld the bier, over which was a veil of white linen; and wax\ntapers were burning beside and around it, and none that supported the\nbier was lower in rank than a powerful Baron.\n\nNever did Owain see an assemblage so gorgeous with satin, and silk,\nand sendal.  And following the train, he beheld a lady with yellow\nhair falling over her shoulders, and stained with blood; and about\nher a dress of yellow satin, which was torn.  Upon her feet were\nshoes of variegated leather.  And it was a marvel that the ends of\nher fingers were not bruised, from the violence with which she smote\nher hands together.  Truly she would have been the fairest lady Owain\never saw, had she been in her usual guise.  And her cry was louder\nthan the shout of the men, or the clamour of the trumpets.  No sooner\nhad he beheld the lady, than he became inflamed with her love, so\nthat it took entire possession of him.\n\nThen he inquired of the maiden who the lady was.  \"Heaven knows,\"\nreplied the maiden, \"she may be said to be the fairest, and the most\nchaste, and the most liberal, and the wisest, and the most noble of\nwomen.  And she is my mistress; and she is called the Countess of the\nFountain, the wife of him whom thou didst slay yesterday.\"  \"Verily,\"\nsaid Owain, \"she is the woman that I love best.\"  \"Verily,\" said the\nmaiden, \"she shall also love thee not a little.\"\n\nAnd with that the maid arose, and kindled a fire, and filled a pot\nwith water, and placed it to warm; and she brought a towel of white\nlinen, and placed it around Owain's neck; and she took a goblet of\nivory, and a silver basin, and filled them with warm water, wherewith\nshe washed Owain's head.  Then she opened a wooden casket, and drew\nforth a razor, whose haft was of ivory, and upon which were two\nrivets of gold.  And she shaved his beard, and she dried his head,\nand his throat, with the towel.  Then she rose up from before Owain,\nand brought him to eat.  And truly Owain had never so good a meal,\nnor was he ever so well served.\n\nWhen he had finished his repast, the maiden arranged his couch.\n\"Come here,\" said she, \"and sleep, and I will go and woo for thee.\"\nAnd Owain went to sleep, and the maiden shut the door of the chamber\nafter her, and went towards the Castle.  When she came there, she\nfound nothing but mourning, and sorrow; and the Countess in her\nchamber could not bear the sight of any one through grief.  Luned\ncame and saluted her, but the Countess answered her not.  And the\nmaiden bent down towards her, and said, \"What aileth thee, that thou\nanswerest no one to-day?\"  \"Luned,\" said the Countess, \"what change\nhath befallen thee, that thou hast not come to visit me in my grief?\nIt was wrong in thee, and I having made thee rich; it was wrong in\nthee that thou didst not come to see me in my distress.  That was\nwrong in thee.\"  \"Truly,\" said Luned, \"I thought thy good sense was\ngreater than I find it to be.  Is it well for thee to mourn after\nthat good man, or for anything else, that thou canst not have?\"  \"I\ndeclare to heaven,\" said the Countess, \"that in the whole world there\nis not a man equal to him.\"  \"Not so,\" said Luned, \"for an ugly man\nwould be as good as, or better than he.\"  \"I declare to heaven,\" said\nthe Countess, \"that were it not repugnant to me to cause to be put to\ndeath one whom I have brought up, I would have thee executed, for\nmaking such a comparison to me.  As it is, I will banish thee.\"  \"I\nam glad,\" said Luned, \"that thou hast no other cause to do so, than\nthat I would have been of service to thee where thou didst not know\nwhat was to thine advantage.  And henceforth evil betide whichever of\nus shall make the first advance towards reconciliation to the other;\nwhether I should seek an invitation from thee, or thou of thine own\naccord shouldst send to invite me.\"\n\nWith that Luned went forth:  and the Countess arose and followed her\nto the door of the chamber, and began coughing loudly.  And when\nLuned looked back, the Countess beckoned to her; and she returned to\nthe Countess.  \"In truth,\" said the Countess, \"evil is thy\ndisposition; but if thou knowest what is to my advantage, declare it\nto me.\"  \"I will do so,\" quoth she.\n\n\"Thou knowest that except by warfare and arms it is impossible for\nthee to preserve thy possessions; delay not, therefore, to seek some\none who can defend them.\"  \"And how can I do that?\" said the\nCountess.  \"I will tell thee,\" said Luned.  \"Unless thou canst defend\nthe fountain, thou canst not maintain thy dominions; and no one can\ndefend the fountain, except it be a knight of Arthur's household; and\nI will go to Arthur's Court, and ill betide me, if I return thence\nwithout a warrior who can guard the fountain as well as, or even\nbetter than, he who defended it formerly.\"  \"That will be hard to\nperform,\" said the Countess.  \"Go, however, and make proof of that\nwhich thou hast promised.\"\n\nLuned set out, under the pretence of going to Arthur's Court; but she\nwent back to the chamber where she had left Owain; and she tarried\nthere with him as long as it might have taken her to have travelled\nto the Court of King Arthur.  And at the end of that time, she\napparelled herself and went to visit the Countess.  And the Countess\nwas much rejoiced when she saw her, and inquired what news she\nbrought from the Court.  \"I bring thee the best of news,\" said Luned,\n\"for I have compassed the object of my mission.  When wilt thou, that\nI should present to thee the chieftain who has come with me hither?\"\n\"Bring him here to visit me to-morrow, at mid-day,\" said the\nCountess, \"and I will cause the town to be assembled by that time.\"\n\nAnd Luned returned home.  And the next day, at noon, Owain arrayed\nhimself in a coat, and a surcoat, and a mantle of yellow satin, upon\nwhich was a broad band of gold lace; and on his feet were high shoes\nof variegated leather, which were fastened by golden clasps, in the\nform of lions.  And they proceeded to the chamber of the Countess.\n\nRight glad was the Countess of their coming, and she gazed\nsteadfastly upon Owain, and said, \"Luned, this knight has not the\nlook of a traveller.\"  \"What harm is there in that, lady?\" said\nLuned.  \"I am certain,\" said the Countess, \"that no other man than\nthis chased the soul from the body of my lord.\"  \"So much the better\nfor thee, lady,\" said Luned, \"for had he not been stronger than thy\nlord he could not have deprived him of life.  There is no remedy for\nthat which is past, be it as it may.\"  \"Go back to thine abode,\" said\nthe Countess, \"and I will take counsel.\"\n\nThe next day the Countess caused all her subjects to assemble, and\nshowed them that her earldom was left defenceless, and that it could\nnot be protected but with horse and arms, and military skill.\n\"Therefore,\" said she, \"this is what I offer for your choice:  either\nlet one of you take me, or give your consent for me to take a husband\nfrom elsewhere to defend my dominions.\"\n\nSo they came to the determination that it was better that she should\nhave permission to marry some one from elsewhere; and, thereupon, she\nsent for the bishops and archbishops to celebrate her nuptials with\nOwain.  And the men of the earldom did Owain homage.\n\nAnd Owain defended the Fountain with lance and sword.  And this is\nthe manner in which he defended it:  Whensoever a knight came there\nhe overthrew him, and sold him for his full worth, and what he thus\ngained he divided among his barons and his knights; and no man in the\nwhole world could be more beloved than he was by his subjects.  And\nit was thus for the space of three years.\n\n\nIt befell that as Gwalchmai went forth one day with King Arthur, he\nperceived him to be very sad and sorrowful.  And Gwalchmai was much\ngrieved to see Arthur in this state; and he questioned him, saying,\n\"Oh, my lord! what has befallen thee?\"  \"In sooth, Gwalchmai,\" said\nArthur, \"I am grieved concerning Owain, whom I have lost these three\nyears, and I shall certainly die if the fourth year passes without my\nseeing him.  Now I am sure, that it is through the tale which Kynon\nthe son of Clydno related, that I have lost Owain.\"  \"There is no\nneed for thee,\" said Gwalchmai, \"to summon to arms thy whole\ndominions on this account, for thou thyself and the men of thy\nhousehold will be able to avenge Owain, if he be slain; or to set him\nfree, if he be in prison; and, if alive, to bring him back with\nthee.\"  And it was settled according to what Gwalchmai had said.\n\nThen Arthur and the men of his household prepared to go and seek\nOwain, and their number was three thousand, besides their attendants.\nAnd Kynon the son of Clydno acted as their guide.  And Arthur came to\nthe Castle where Kynon had been before, and when he came there the\nyouths were shooting in the same place, and the yellow man was\nstanding hard by.  When the yellow man saw Arthur he greeted him, and\ninvited him to the Castle; and Arthur accepted his invitation, and\nthey entered the Castle together.  And great as was the number of his\nretinue, their presence was scarcely observed in the Castle, so vast\nwas its extent.  And the maidens rose up to wait on them, and the\nservice of the maidens appeared to them all to excel any attendance\nthey had ever met with; and even the pages who had charge of the\nhorses were no worse served, that night, than Arthur himself would\nhave been in his own palace.\n\nThe next morning Arthur set out thence, with Kynon for his guide, and\ncame to the place where the black man was.  And the stature of the\nblack man was more surprising to Arthur than it had been represented\nto him.  And they came to the top of the wooded steep, and traversed\nthe valley till they reached the green tree, where they saw the\nfountain, and the bowl, and the slab.  And upon that, Kai came to\nArthur and spoke to him.  \"My lord,\" said he, \"I know the meaning of\nall this, and my request is, that thou wilt permit me to throw the\nwater on the slab, and to receive the first adventure that may\nbefall.\"  And Arthur gave him leave.\n\nThen Kai threw a bowlful of water upon the slab, and immediately\nthere came the thunder, and after the thunder the shower.  And such a\nthunderstorm they had never known before, and many of the attendants\nwho were in Arthur's train were killed by the shower.  After the\nshower had ceased the sky became clear; and on looking at the tree\nthey beheld it completely leafless.  Then the birds descended upon\nthe tree, and the song of the birds was far sweeter than any strain\nthey had ever heard before.  Then they beheld a knight on a coal-\nblack horse, clothed in black satin, coming rapidly towards them.\nAnd Kai met him and encountered him, and it was not long before Kai\nwas overthrown.  And the knight withdrew, and Arthur and his host\nencamped for the night.\n\nAnd when they arose in the morning, they perceived the signal of\ncombat upon the lance of the Knight.  And Kai came to Arthur, and\nspoke to him:  \"My lord,\" said he, \"though I was overthrown\nyesterday, if it seem good to thee, I would gladly meet the Knight\nagain to-day.\"  \"Thou mayst do so,\" said Arthur.  And Kai went\ntowards the Knight.  And on the spot he overthrew Kai, and struck him\nwith the head of his lance in the forehead, so that it broke his\nhelmet and the head-piece, and pierced the skin and the flesh, the\nbreadth of the spear-head, even to the bone.  And Kai returned to his\ncompanions.\n\nAfter this, all the household of Arthur went forth, one after the\nother, to combat the Knight, until there was not one that was not\noverthrown by him, except Arthur and Gwalchmai.  And Arthur armed\nhimself to encounter the Knight.  \"Oh, my lord,\" said Gwalchmai,\n\"permit me to fight with him first.\"  And Arthur permitted him.  And\nhe went forth to meet the Knight, having over himself and his horse a\nsatin robe of honour which had been sent him by the daughter of the\nEarl of Rhangyw, and in this dress he was not known by any of the\nhost.  And they charged each other, and fought all that day until the\nevening, and neither of them was able to unhorse the other.\n\nThe next day they fought with strong lances, and neither of them\ncould obtain the mastery.\n\nAnd the third day they fought with exceeding strong lances.  And they\nwere incensed with rage, and fought furiously, even until noon.  And\nthey gave each other such a shock that the girths of their horses\nwere broken, so that they fell over their horses' cruppers to the\nground.  And they rose up speedily, and drew their swords, and\nresumed the combat; and the multitude that witnessed their encounter\nfelt assured that they had never before seen two men so valiant or so\npowerful.  And had it been midnight, it would have been light from\nthe fire that flashed from their weapons.  And the Knight gave\nGwalchmai a blow that turned his helmet from off his face, so that\nthe Knight knew that it was Gwalchmai.  Then Owain said, \"My lord\nGwalchmai, I did not know thee for my cousin, owing to the robe of\nhonour that enveloped thee; take my sword and my arms.\"  Said\nGwalchmai, \"Thou, Owain, art the victor; take thou my sword.\"  And\nwith that Arthur saw that they were conversing, and advanced towards\nthem.  \"My lord Arthur,\" said Gwalchmai, \"here is Owain, who has\nvanquished me, and will not take my arms.\"  \"My lord,\" said Owain,\n\"it is he that has vanquished me, and he will not take my sword.\"\n\"Give me your swords,\" said Arthur, \"and then neither of you has\nvanquished the other.\"  Then Owain put his arms around Arthur's neck,\nand they embraced.  And all the host hurried forward to see Owain,\nand to embrace him; and there was nigh being a loss of life, so great\nwas the press.\n\nAnd they retired that night, and the next day Arthur prepared to\ndepart.  \"My lord,\" said Owain, \"this is not well of thee; for I have\nbeen absent from thee these three years, and during all that time, up\nto this very day, I have been preparing a banquet for thee, knowing\nthat thou wouldst come to seek me.  Tarry with me, therefore, until\nthou and thy attendants have recovered the fatigues of the journey,\nand have been anointed.\"\n\nAnd they all proceeded to the Castle of the Countess of the Fountain,\nand the banquet which had been three years preparing was consumed in\nthree months.  Never had they a more delicious or agreeable banquet.\nAnd Arthur prepared to depart.  Then he sent an embassy to the\nCountess, to beseech her to permit Owain to go with him for the space\nof three months, that he might show him to the nobles and the fair\ndames of the Island of Britain.  And the Countess gave her consent,\nalthough it was very painful to her.  So Owain came with Arthur to\nthe Island of Britain.  And when he was once more amongst his kindred\nand friends, he remained three years, instead of three months, with\nthem.\n\n\nAnd as Owain one day sat at meat, in the city of Caerlleon upon Usk,\nbehold a damsel entered upon a bay horse, with a curling mane and\ncovered with foam, and the bridle and so much as was seen of the\nsaddle were of gold.  And the damsel was arrayed in a dress of yellow\nsatin.  And she came up to Owain, and took the ring from off his\nhand.  \"Thus,\" said she, \"shall be treated the deceiver, the traitor,\nthe faithless, the disgraced, and the beardless.\"  And she turned her\nhorse's head and departed.\n\nThen his adventure came to Owain's remembrance, and he was sorrowful;\nand having finished eating he went to his own abode and made\npreparations that night.  And the next day he arose but did not go to\nthe Court, but wandered to the distant parts of the earth and to\nuncultivated mountains.  And he remained there until all his apparel\nwas worn out, and his body was wasted away, and his hair was grown\nlong.  And he went about with the wild beasts and fed with them,\nuntil they became familiar with him; but at length he grew so weak\nthat he could no longer bear them company.  Then he descended from\nthe mountains to the valley, and came to a park that was the fairest\nin the world, and belonged to a widowed Countess.\n\nOne day the Countess and her maidens went forth to walk by a lake,\nthat was in the middle of the park.  And they saw the form of a man.\nAnd they were terrified.  Nevertheless they went near him, and\ntouched him, and looked at him.  And they saw that there was life in\nhim, though he was exhausted by the heat of the sun.  And the\nCountess returned to the Castle, and took a flask full of precious\nointment, and gave it to one of her maidens.  \"Go with this,\" said\nshe, \"and take with thee yonder horse and clothing, and place them\nnear the man we saw just now.  And anoint him with this balsam, near\nhis heart; and if there is life in him, he will arise through the\nefficacy of this balsam.  Then watch what he will do.\"\n\nAnd the maiden departed from her, and poured the whole of the balsam\nupon Owain, and left the horse and the garments hard by, and went a\nlittle way off, and hid herself to watch him.  In a short time she\nsaw him begin to move his arms; and he rose up, and looked at his\nperson, and became ashamed of the unseemliness of his appearance.\nThen he perceived the horse and the garments that were near him.  And\nhe crept forward till he was able to draw the garments to him from\noff the saddle.  And he clothed himself, and with difficulty mounted\nthe horse.  Then the damsel discovered herself to him, and saluted\nhim.  And he was rejoiced when he saw her, and inquired of her, what\nland and what territory that was.  \"Truly,\" said the maiden, \"a\nwidowed Countess owns yonder Castle; at the death of her husband, he\nleft her two Earldoms, but at this day she has but this one dwelling\nthat has not been wrested from her by a young Earl, who is her\nneighbour, because she refused to become his wife.\"  \"That is pity,\"\nsaid Owain.  And he and the maiden proceeded to the Castle; and he\nalighted there, and the maiden conducted him to a pleasant chamber,\nand kindled a fire and left him.\n\nAnd the maiden came to the Countess, and gave the flask into her\nhand.  \"Ha! maiden,\" said the Countess, \"where is all the balsam?\"\n\"Have I not used it all?\" said she.  \"Oh, maiden,\" said the Countess,\n\"I cannot easily forgive thee this; it is sad for me to have wasted\nseven-score pounds' worth of precious ointment upon a stranger whom I\nknow not.  However, maiden, wait thou upon him, until he is quite\nrecovered.\"\n\nAnd the maiden did so, and furnished him with meat and drink, and\nfire, and lodging, and medicaments, until he was well again.  And in\nthree months he was restored to his former guise, and became even\nmore comely than he had ever been before.\n\nOne day Owain heard a great tumult, and a sound of arms in the\nCastle, and he inquired of the maiden the cause thereof.  \"The Earl,\"\nsaid she, \"whom I mentioned to thee, has come before the Castle, with\na numerous army, to subdue the Countess.\"  And Owain inquired of her\nwhether the Countess had a horse and arms in her possession.  \"She\nhas the best in the world,\" said the maiden.  \"Wilt thou go and\nrequest the loan of a horse and arms for me,\" said Owain, \"that I may\ngo and look at this army?\"  \"I will,\" said the maiden.\n\nAnd she came to the Countess, and told her what Owain had said.  And\nthe Countess laughed.  \"Truly,\" said she, \"I will even give him a\nhorse and arms for ever; such a horse and such arms had he never yet,\nand I am glad that they should be taken by him to-day, lest my\nenemies should have them against my will to-morrow.  Yet I know not\nwhat he would do with them.\"\n\nThe Countess bade them bring out a beautiful black steed, upon which\nwas a beechen saddle, and a suit of armour, for man and horse.  And\nOwain armed himself, and mounted the horse, and went forth, attended\nby two pages completely equipped, with horses and arms.  And when\nthey came near to the Earl's army, they could see neither its extent\nnor its extremity.  And Owain asked the pages in which troop the Earl\nwas.  \"In yonder troop,\" said they, \"in which are four yellow\nstandards.  Two of them are before, and two behind him.\"  \"Now,\" said\nOwain, \"do you return and await me near the portal of the Castle.\"\nSo they returned, and Owain pressed forward until he met the Earl.\nAnd Owain drew him completely out of his saddle, and turned his\nhorse's head towards the Castle, and though it was with difficulty,\nhe brought the Earl to the portal, where the pages awaited him.  And\nin they came.  And Owain presented the Earl as a gift to the\nCountess.  And said to her, \"Behold a requital to thee for thy\nblessed balsam.\"\n\nThe army encamped around the Castle.  And the Earl restored to the\nCountess the two Earldoms he had taken from her, as a ransom for his\nlife; and for his freedom he gave her the half of his own dominions,\nand all his gold, and his silver, and his jewels, besides hostages.\n\nAnd Owain took his departure.  And the Countess and all her subjects\nbesought him to remain, but Owain chose rather to wander through\ndistant lands and deserts.\n\nAnd as he journeyed, he heard a loud yelling in a wood.  And it was\nrepeated a second and a third time.  And Owain went towards the spot,\nand beheld a huge craggy mound, in the middle of the wood; on the\nside of which was a grey rock.  And there was a cleft in the rock,\nand a serpent was within the cleft.  And near the rock stood a black\nlion, and every time the lion sought to go thence, the serpent darted\ntowards him to attack him.  And Owain unsheathed his sword, and drew\nnear to the rock; and as the serpent sprang out, he struck him with\nhis sword, and cut him in two.  And he dried his sword, and went on\nhis way, as before.  But behold the lion followed him, and played\nabout him, as though it had been a greyhound that he had reared.\n\nThey proceeded thus throughout the day, until the evening.  And when\nit was time for Owain to take his rest, he dismounted, and turned his\nhorse loose in a flat and wooded meadow.  And he struck fire, and\nwhen the fire was kindled, the lion brought him fuel enough to last\nfor three nights.  And the lion disappeared.  And presently the lion\nreturned, bearing a fine large roebuck.  And he threw it down before\nOwain, who went towards the fire with it.\n\nAnd Owain took the roebuck, and skinned it, and placed collops of its\nflesh upon skewers, around the fire.  The rest of the buck he gave to\nthe lion to devour.  While he was doing this, he heard a deep sigh\nnear him, and a second, and a third.  And Owain called out to know\nwhether the sigh he heard proceeded from a mortal; and he received\nanswer that it did.  \"Who art thou?\" said Owain.  \"Truly,\" said the\nvoice, \"I am Luned, the handmaiden of the Countess of the Fountain.\"\n\"And what dost thou here?\" said Owain.  \"I am imprisoned,\" said she,\n\"on account of the knight who came from Arthur's Court, and married\nthe Countess.  And he stayed a short time with her, but he afterwards\ndeparted for the Court of Arthur, and has not returned since.  And he\nwas the friend I loved best in the world.  And two of the pages in\nthe Countess's chamber traduced him, and called him a deceiver.  And\nI told them that they two were not a match for him alone.  So they\nimprisoned me in the stone vault, and said that I should be put to\ndeath, unless he came himself to deliver me, by a certain day; and\nthat is no further off than the day after to-morrow.  And I have no\none to send to seek him for me.  And his name is Owain the son of\nUrien.\"  \"And art thou certain that if that knight knew all this, he\nwould come to thy rescue?\"  \"I am most certain of it,\" said she.\n\nWhen the collops were cooked, Owain divided them into two parts,\nbetween himself and the maiden; and after they had eaten, they talked\ntogether, until the day dawned.  And the next morning Owain inquired\nof the damsel, if there was any place where he could get food and\nentertainment for that night.  \"There is, Lord,\" said she; \"cross\nover yonder, and go along the side of the river, and in a short time\nthou wilt see a great Castle, in which are many towers, and the Earl\nwho owns that Castle is the most hospitable man in the world.  There\nthou mayst spend the night.\"\n\nNever did sentinel keep stricter watch over his lord, than the lion\nthat night over Owain.\n\nAnd Owain accoutred his horse, and passed across by the ford, and\ncame in sight of the Castle.  And he entered it, and was honourably\nreceived.  And his horse was well cared for, and plenty of fodder was\nplaced before him.  Then the lion went and lay down in the horse's\nmanger; so that none of the people of the Castle dared to approach\nhim.  The treatment which Owain met with there was such as he had\nnever known elsewhere, for every one was as sorrowful as though death\nhad been upon him.  And they went to meat; and the Earl sat upon one\nside of Owain, and on the other side his only daughter.  And Owain\nhad never seen any more lovely than she.  Then the lion came and\nplaced himself between Owain's feet, and he fed him with every kind\nof food that he took himself.  And he never saw anything equal to the\nsadness of the people.\n\nIn the middle of the repast the Earl began to bid Owain welcome.\n\"Then,\" said Owain, \"behold, it is time for thee to be cheerful.\"\n\"Heaven knows,\" said the Earl, \"that it is not thy coming that makes\nus sorrowful, but we have cause enough for sadness and care.\"  \"What\nis that?\" said Owain.  \"I have two sons,\" replied the Earl, \"and\nyesterday they went to the mountains to hunt.  Now there is on the\nmountain a monster who kills men and devours them, and he seized my\nsons; and to-morrow is the time he has fixed to be here, and he\nthreatens that he will then slay my sons before my eyes, unless I\nwill deliver into his hands this my daughter.  He has the form of a\nman, but in stature he is no less than a giant.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said Owain, \"that is lamentable.  And which wilt thou do?\"\n\"Heaven knows,\" said the Earl, \"it will be better that my sons should\nbe slain against my will, than that I should voluntarily give up my\ndaughter to him to ill-treat and destroy.\"  Then they talked about\nother things, and Owain stayed there that night.\n\nThe next morning they heard an exceeding great clamour, which was\ncaused by the coming of the giant with the two youths.  And the Earl\nwas anxious both to protect his Castle and to release his two sons.\nThen Owain put on his armour and went forth to encounter the giant,\nand the lion followed him.  And when the giant saw that Owain was\narmed, he rushed towards him and attacked him.  And the lion fought\nwith the giant much more fiercely than Owain did.  \"Truly,\" said the\ngiant, \"I should find no difficulty in fighting with thee, were it\nnot for the animal that is with thee.\"  Upon that Owain took the lion\nback to the Castle and shut the gate upon him, and then he returned\nto fight the giant, as before.  And the lion roared very loud, for he\nheard that it went hard with Owain.  And he climbed up till he\nreached the top of the Earl's hall, and thence he got to the top of\nthe Castle, and he sprang down from the walls and went and joined\nOwain.  And the lion gave the giant a stroke with his paw, which tore\nhim from his shoulder to his hip, and his heart was laid bare, and\nthe giant fell down dead.  Then Owain restored the two youths to\ntheir father.\n\nThe Earl besought Owain to remain with him, and he would not, but set\nforward towards the meadow where Luned was.  And when he came there\nhe saw a great fire kindled, and two youths with beautiful curling\nauburn hair were leading the maiden to cast her into the fire.  And\nOwain asked them what charge they had against her.  And they told him\nof the compact that was between them, as the maiden had done the\nnight before.  \"And,\" said they, \"Owain has failed her, therefore we\nare taking her to be burnt.\"  \"Truly,\" said Owain, \"he is a good\nknight, and if he knew that the maiden was in such peril, I marvel\nthat he came not to her rescue; but if you will accept me in his\nstead, I will do battle with you.\"  \"We will,\" said the youths, \"by\nhim who made us.\"\n\nAnd they attacked Owain, and he was hard beset by them.  And with\nthat the lion came to Owain's assistance, and they two got the better\nof the young men.  And they said to him, \"Chieftain, it was not\nagreed that we should fight save with thyself alone, and it is harder\nfor us to contend with yonder animal than with thee.\"  And Owain put\nthe lion in the place where the maiden had been imprisoned, and\nblocked up the door with stones, and he went to fight with the young\nmen, as before.  But Owain had not his usual strength, and the two\nyouths pressed hard upon him.  And the lion roared incessantly at\nseeing Owain in trouble; and he burst through the wall until he found\na way out, and rushed upon the young men, and instantly slew them.\nSo Luned was saved from being burned.\n\nThen Owain returned with Luned to the dominions of the Countess of\nthe Fountain.  And when he went thence he took the Countess with him\nto Arthur's Court, and she was his wife as long as she lived.\n\n\nAnd then he took the road that led to the Court of the savage black\nman, and Owain fought with him, and the lion did not quit Owain until\nhe had vanquished him.  And when he reached the Court of the savage\nblack man he entered the hall, and beheld four-and-twenty ladies, the\nfairest that could be seen.  And the garments which they had on were\nnot worth four-and twenty pence, and they were as sorrowful as death.\nAnd Owain asked them the cause of their sadness.  And they said, \"We\nare the daughters of Earls, and we all came here with our husbands,\nwhom we dearly loved.  And we were received with honour and\nrejoicing.  And we were thrown into a state of stupor, and while we\nwere thus, the demon who owns this Castle slew all our husbands, and\ntook from us our horses, and our raiment, and our gold, and our\nsilver; and the corpses of our husbands are still in this house, and\nmany others with them.  And this, Chieftain, is the cause of our\ngrief, and we are sorry that thou art come hither, lest harm should\nbefall thee.\"\n\nAnd Owain was grieved when he heard this.  And he went forth from the\nCastle, and he beheld a knight approaching him, who saluted him in a\nfriendly and cheerful manner, as if he had been a brother.  And this\nwas the savage black man.  \"In very sooth,\" said Owain, \"it is not to\nseek thy friendship that I am here.\"  \"In sooth,\" said he, \"thou\nshalt not find it then.\"  And with that they charged each other, and\nfought furiously.  And Owain overcame him, and bound his hands behind\nhis back.  Then the black savage besought Owain to spare his life,\nand spoke thus:  \"My lord Owain,\" said he, \"it was foretold that thou\nshouldst come hither and vanquish me, and thou hast done so.  I was a\nrobber here, and my house was a house of spoil; but grant me my life,\nand I will become the keeper of an Hospice, and I will maintain this\nhouse as an Hospice for weak and for strong, as long as I live, for\nthe good of thy soul.\"  And Owain accepted this proposal of him, and\nremained there that night.\n\nAnd the next day he took the four-and-twenty ladies, and their\nhorses, and their raiment, and what they possessed of goods and\njewels, and proceeded with them to Arthur's Court.  And if Arthur was\nrejoiced when he saw him, after he had lost him the first time, his\njoy was now much greater.  And of those ladies, such as wished to\nremain in Arthur's Court remained there, and such as wished to depart\ndeparted.\n\nAnd thenceforward Owain dwelt at Arthur's Court greatly beloved, as\nthe head of his household, until he went away with his followers; and\nthose were the army of three hundred ravens which Kenverchyn had left\nhim.  And wherever Owain went with these he was victorious.\n\nAnd this is the tale of THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN.\n\n\n\nPEREDUR THE SON OF EVRAWC\n\n\n\nEarl Evrawc owned the Earldom of the North.  And he had seven sons.\nAnd Evrawc maintained himself not so much by his own possessions as\nby attending tournaments, and wars, and combats.  And, as it often\nbefalls those who join in encounters and wars, he was slain, and six\nof his sons likewise.  Now the name of his seventh son was Peredur,\nand he was the youngest of them.  And he was not of an age to go to\nwars and encounters, otherwise he might have been slain as well as\nhis father and brothers.  His mother was a scheming and thoughtful\nwoman, and she was very solicitous concerning this her only son and\nhis possessions.  So she took counsel with herself to leave the\ninhabited country, and to flee to the deserts and unfrequented\nwildernesses.  And she permitted none to bear her company thither but\nwomen and boys, and spiritless men, who were both unaccustomed and\nunequal to war and fighting.  And none dared to bring either horses\nor arms where her son was, lest he should set his mind upon them.\nAnd the youth went daily to divert himself in the forest, by flinging\nsticks and staves.  And one day he saw his mother's flock of goats,\nand near the goats two hinds were standing.  And he marvelled greatly\nthat these two should be without horns, while the others had them.\nAnd he thought they had long run wild, and on that account they had\nlost their horns.  And by activity and swiftness of foot, he drove\nthe hinds and the goats together into the house which there was for\nthe goats at the extremity of the forest.  Then Peredur returned to\nhis mother.  \"Ah, mother,\" said he, \"a marvellous thing have I seen\nin the wood; two of thy goats have run wild, and lost their horns,\nthrough their having been so long missing in the wood.  And no man\nhad ever more trouble than I had to drive them in.\"  Then they all\narose and went to see.  And when they beheld the hinds they were\ngreatly astonished.\n\nAnd one day they saw three knights coming along the horse-road on the\nborders of the forest.  And the three knights were Gwalchmai the son\nof Gwyar, and Geneir Gwystyl, and Owain the son of Urien.  And Owain\nkept on the track of the knight who had divided the apples in\nArthur's Court, whom they were in pursuit of.  \"Mother,\" said\nPeredur, \"what are those yonder?\"  \"They are angels, my son,\" said\nshe.  \"By my faith,\" said Peredur, \"I will go and become an angel\nwith them.\"  And Peredur went to the road, and met them.  \"Tell me,\ngood soul,\" said Owain, \"sawest thou a knight pass this way, either\nto-day or yesterday?\"  \"I know not,\" answered he, \"what a knight is.\"\n\"Such an one as I am,\" said Owain.  \"If thou wilt tell me what I ask\nthee, I will tell thee that which thou askest me.\"  \"Gladly will I do\nso,\" replied Owain.  \"What is this?\" demanded Peredur, concerning the\nsaddle.  \"It is a saddle,\" said Owain.  Then he asked about all the\naccoutrements which he saw upon the men, and the horses, and the\narms, and what they were for, and how they were used.  And Owain\nshewed him all these things fully, and told him what use was made of\nthem.  \"Go forward,\" said Peredur, \"for I saw such an one as thou\ninquirest for, and I will follow thee.\"\n\nThen Peredur returned to his mother and her company, and he said to\nher, \"Mother, those were not angels, but honourable knights.\"  Then\nhis mother swooned away.  And Peredur went to the place where they\nkept the horses that carried firewood, and that brought meat and\ndrink from the inhabited country to the desert.  And he took a bony\npiebald horse, which seemed to him the strongest of them.  And he\npressed a pack into the form of a saddle, and with twisted twigs he\nimitated the trappings which he had seen upon the horses.  And when\nPeredur came again to his mother, the Countess had recovered from her\nswoon.  \"My son,\" said she, \"desirest thou to ride forth?\"  \"Yes,\nwith thy leave,\" said he.  \"Wait, then, that I may counsel thee\nbefore thou goest.\"  \"Willingly,\" he answered; \"speak quickly.\"  \"Go\nforward, then,\" she said, \"to the Court of Arthur, where there are\nthe best, and the boldest, and the most bountiful of men.  And\nwherever thou seest a church, repeat there thy Paternoster unto it.\nAnd if thou see meat and drink, and have need of them, and none have\nthe kindness or the courtesy to give them to thee, take them thyself.\nIf thou hear an outcry, proceed towards it, especially if it be the\noutcry of a woman.  If thou see a fair jewel, possess thyself of it,\nand give it to another, for thus thou shalt obtain praise.  If thou\nsee a fair woman, pay thy court to her, whether she will or no; for\nthus thou wilt render thyself a better and more esteemed man than\nthou wast before.\"\n\nAfter this discourse, Peredur mounted the horse, and taking a handful\nof sharp-pointed forks in his hand, he rode forth.  And he journeyed\ntwo days and two nights in the woody wildernesses, and in desert\nplaces, without food and without drink.  And then he came to a vast\nwild wood, and far within the wood he saw a fair even glade, and in\nthe glade he saw a tent, and the tent seeming to him to be a church,\nhe repeated his Paternoster to it.  And he went towards it, and the\ndoor of the tent was open.  And a golden chair was near the door.\nAnd on the chair sat a lovely auburn-haired maiden, with a golden\nfrontlet on her forehead, and sparkling stones in the frontlet, and\nwith a large gold ring on her hand.  And Peredur dismounted, and\nentered the tent.  And the maiden was glad at his coming, and bade\nhim welcome.  At the entrance of the tent he saw food, and two flasks\nfull of wine, and two loaves of fine wheaten flour, and collops of\nthe flesh of the wild boar.  \"My mother told me,\" said Peredur,\n\"wheresoever I saw meat and drink, to take it.\"  \"Take the meat and\nwelcome, chieftain,\" said she.  So Peredur took half of the meat and\nof the liquor himself, and left the rest to the maiden.  And when\nPeredur had finished eating, he bent upon his knee before the maiden.\n\"My mother,\" said he, \"told me, wheresoever I saw a fair jewel, to\ntake it.\"  \"Do so, my soul,\" said she.  So Peredur took the ring.\nAnd he mounted his horse, and proceeded on his journey.\n\nAfter this, behold the knight came to whom the tent belonged; and he\nwas the Lord of the Glade.  And he saw the track of the horse, and he\nsaid to the maiden, \"Tell me who has been here since I departed.\"  \"A\nman,\" said she, \"of wonderful demeanour.\"  And she described to him\nwhat Peredur's appearance and conduct had been.  \"Tell me,\" said he,\n\"did he offer thee any wrong?\"  \"No,\" answered the maiden, \"by my\nfaith, he harmed me not.\"  \"By my faith, I do not believe thee; and\nuntil I can meet with him, and revenge the insult he has done me, and\nwreak my vengeance upon him, thou shalt not remain two nights in the\nsame house.\"  And the knight arose, and set forth to seek Peredur.\n\nMeanwhile Peredur journeyed on towards Arthur's Court.  And before he\nreached it, another knight had been there, who gave a ring of thick\ngold at the door of the gate for holding his horse, and went into the\nHall where Arthur and his household, and Gwenhwyvar and her maidens,\nwere assembled.  And the page of the chamber was serving Gwenhwyvar\nwith a golden goblet.  Then the knight dashed the liquor that was\ntherein upon her face, and upon her stomacher, and gave her a violent\nblow on the face, and said, \"If any have the boldness to dispute this\ngoblet with me, and to revenge the insult to Gwenhwyvar, let him\nfollow me to the meadow, and there I will await him.\"  So the knight\ntook his horse, and rode to the meadow.  And all the household hung\ndown their heads, lest any of them should be requested to go and\navenge the insult to Gwenhwyvar.  For it seemed to them, that no one\nwould have ventured on so daring an outrage, unless he possessed such\npowers, through magic or charms, that none could be able to take\nvengeance upon him.  Then, behold, Peredur entered the Hall, upon the\nbony piebald horse, with the uncouth trappings upon it; and in this\nway he traversed the whole length of the Hall.  In the centre of the\nHall stood Kai.  \"Tell me, tall man,\" said Peredur, \"is that Arthur\nyonder?\"  \"What wouldest thou with Arthur?\" asked Kai.  \"My mother\ntold me to go to Arthur, and receive the honour of knighthood.\"  \"By\nmy faith,\" said he, \"thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and\nwith arms.\"  Thereupon he was perceived by all the household, and\nthey threw sticks at him.  Then, behold, a dwarf came forward.  He\nhad already been a year at Arthur's Court, both he and a female\ndwarf.  They had craved harbourage of Arthur, and had obtained it;\nand during the whole year, neither of them had spoken a single word\nto any one.  When the dwarf beheld Peredur, \"Haha!\" said he, \"the\nwelcome of Heaven be unto thee, goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc, the\nchief of warriors, and flower of knighthood.\"  \"Truly,\" said Kai,\n\"thou art ill-taught to remain a year mute at Arthur's Court, with\nchoice of society; and now, before the face of Arthur and all his\nhousehold, to call out, and declare such a man as this the chief of\nwarriors, and the flower of knighthood.\"  And he gave him such a box\non the ear that he fell senseless to the ground.  Then exclaimed the\nfemale dwarf, \"Haha! goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc; the welcome of\nHeaven be unto thee, flower of knights, and light of chivalry.\"  \"Of\na truth, maiden,\" said Kai, \"thou art ill-bred to remain mute for a\nyear at the Court of Arthur, and then to speak as thou dost of such a\nman as this.\"  And Kai kicked her with his foot, so that she fell to\nthe ground senseless.  \"Tall man,\" said Peredur, \"shew me which is\nArthur.\"  \"Hold thy peace,\" said Kai, \"and go after the knight who\nwent hence to the meadow, and take from him the goblet, and overthrow\nhim, and possess thyself of his horse and arms, and then thou shalt\nreceive the order of knighthood.\"  \"I will do so, tall man,\" said\nPeredur.  So he turned his horse's head towards the meadow.  And when\nhe came there, the knight was riding up and down, proud of his\nstrength, and valour, and noble mien.  \"Tell me,\" said the knight,\n\"didst thou see any one coming after me from the Court?\"  \"The tall\nman that was there,\" said he, \"desired me to come, and overthrow\nthee, and to take from thee the goblet, and thy horse and thy armour\nfor myself.\"  \"Silence!\" said the knight; \"go back to the Court, and\ntell Arthur, from me, either to come himself, or to send some other\nto fight with me; and unless he do so quickly, I will not wait for\nhim.\"  \"By my faith,\" said Peredur, \"choose thou whether it shall be\nwillingly or unwillingly, but I will have the horse, and the arms,\nand the goblet.\"  And upon this the knight ran at him furiously, and\nstruck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear, between the\nneck and the shoulder.  \"Haha! lad,\" said Peredur, \"my mother's\nservants were not used to play with me in this wise; therefore, thus\nwill I play with thee.\"  And thereupon he struck him with a sharp-\npointed fork, and it hit him in the eye, and came out at the back of\nhis neck, so that he instantly fell down lifeless.\n\n\"Verily,\" said Owain the son of Urien to Kai, \"thou wert ill-advised,\nwhen thou didst send that madman after the knight.  For one of two\nthings must befall him.  He must either be overthrown, or slain.  If\nhe is overthrown by the knight, he will be counted by him to be an\nhonourable person of the Court, and an eternal disgrace will it be to\nArthur and his warriors.  And if he is slain, the disgrace will be\nthe same, and moreover, his sin will be upon him; therefore will I go\nto see what has befallen him.\"  So Owain went to the meadow, and he\nfound Peredur dragging the man about.  \"What art thou doing thus?\"\nsaid Owain.  \"This iron coat,\" said Peredur, \"will never come from\noff him; not by my efforts, at any rate.\"  And Owain unfastened his\narmour and his clothes.  \"Here, my good soul,\" said he, \"is a horse\nand armour better than thine.  Take them joyfully, and come with me\nto Arthur, to receive the order of knighthood, for thou dost merit\nit.\"  \"May I never shew my face again if I go,\" said Peredur; \"but\ntake thou the goblet to Gwenhwyvar, and tell Arthur, that wherever I\nam, I will be his vassal, and will do him what profit and service I\nam able.  And say that I will not come to his Court until I have\nencountered the tall man that is there, to revenge the injury he did\nto the dwarf and dwarfess.\"  And Owain went back to the Court, and\nrelated all these things to Arthur and Gwenhwyvar, and to all the\nhousehold.\n\nAnd Peredur rode forward.  And as he proceeded, behold a knight met\nhim.  \"Whence comest thou?\" said the knight.  \"I come from Arthur's\nCourt,\" said Peredur.  \"Art thou one of his men?\" asked he.  \"Yes, by\nmy faith,\" he answered.  \"A good service, truly, is that of Arthur.\"\n\"Wherefore sayest thou so?\" said Peredur.  \"I will tell thee,\" said\nhe; \"I have always been Arthur's enemy, and all such of his men as I\nhave ever encountered I have slain.\"  And without further parlance\nthey fought, and it was not long before Peredur brought him to the\nground, over his horse's crupper.  Then the knight besought his\nmercy.  \"Mercy thou shalt have,\" said Peredur, \"if thou wilt make\noath to me, that thou wilt go to Arthur's Court, and tell him that it\nwas I that overthrew thee, for the honour of his service; and say,\nthat I will never come to the Court until I have avenged the insult\noffered to the dwarf and dwarfess.\"  The knight pledged him his faith\nof this, and proceeded to the Court of Arthur, and said as he had\npromised, and conveyed the threat to Kai.\n\nAnd Peredur rode forward.  And within that week he encountered\nsixteen knights, and overthrew them all shamefully.  And they all\nwent to Arthur's Court, taking with them the same message which the\nfirst knight had conveyed from Peredur, and the same threat which he\nhad sent to Kai.  And thereupon Kai was reproved by Arthur; and Kai\nwas greatly grieved thereat.\n\nAnd Peredur rode forward.  And he came to a vast and desert wood, on\nthe confines of which was a lake.  And on the other side was a fair\ncastle.  And on the border of the lake he saw a venerable, hoary-\nheaded man, sitting upon a velvet cushion, and having a garment of\nvelvet upon him.  And his attendants were fishing in the lake.  When\nthe hoary-headed man beheld Peredur approaching, he arose and went\ntowards the castle.  And the old man was lame.  Peredur rode to the\npalace, and the door was open, and he entered the hall.  And there\nwas the hoary-headed man sitting on a cushion, and a large blazing\nfire burning before him.  And the household and the company arose to\nmeet Peredur, and disarrayed him.  And the man asked the youth to sit\non the cushion; and they sat down, and conversed together.  When it\nwas time, the tables were laid, and they went to meat.  And when they\nhad finished their meal, the man inquired of Peredur if he knew well\nhow to fight with the sword.  \"I know not,\" said Peredur, \"but were I\nto be taught, doubtless I should.\"  \"Whoever can play well with the\ncudgel and shield, will also be able to fight with a sword.\"  And the\nman had two sons; the one had yellow hair, and the other auburn.\n\"Arise, youths,\" said he, \"and play with the cudgel and the shield.\"\nAnd so did they.  \"Tell me, my soul,\" said the man, \"which of the\nyouths thinkest thou plays best.\"  \"I think,\" said Peredur, \"that the\nyellow-haired youth could draw blood from the other, if he chose.\"\n\"Arise thou, my life, and take the cudgel and the shield from the\nhand of the youth with the auburn hair, and draw blood from the\nyellow-haired youth if thou canst.\"  So Peredur arose, and went to\nplay with the yellow-haired youth; and he lifted up his arm, and\nstruck him such a mighty blow, that his brow fell over his eye, and\nthe blood flowed forth.  \"Ah, my life,\" said the man, \"come now, and\nsit down, for thou wilt become the best fighter with the sword of any\nin this island; and I am thy uncle, thy mother's brother.  And with\nme shalt thou remain a space, in order to learn the manners and\ncustoms of different countries, and courtesy, and gentleness, and\nnoble bearing.  Leave, then, the habits and the discourse of thy\nmother, and I will be thy teacher; and I will raise thee to the rank\nof knight from this time forward.  And thus do thou.  If thou seest\naught to cause thee wonder, ask not the meaning of it; if no one has\nthe courtesy to inform thee, the reproach will not fall upon thee,\nbut upon me that am thy teacher.\"  And they had abundance of honour\nand service.  And when it was time they went to sleep.  At the break\nof day, Peredur arose, and took his horse, and with his uncle's\npermission he rode forth.  And he came to a vast desert wood, and at\nthe further end of the wood was a meadow, and on the other side of\nthe meadow he saw a large castle.  And thitherward Peredur bent his\nway, and he found the gate open, and he proceeded to the hall.  And\nhe beheld a stately hoary-headed man sitting on one side of the hall,\nand many pages around him, who arose to receive and to honour\nPeredur.  And they placed him by the side of the owner of the palace.\nThen they discoursed together; and when it was time to eat, they\ncaused Peredur to sit beside the nobleman during the repast.  And\nwhen they had eaten and drunk as much as they desired, the nobleman\nasked Peredur whether he could fight with a sword?  \"Were I to\nreceive instruction,\" said Peredur, \"I think I could.\"  Now, there\nwas on the floor of the hall a huge staple, as large as a warrior\ncould grasp.  \"Take yonder sword,\" said the man to Peredur, \"and\nstrike the iron staple.\"  So Peredur arose and struck the staple, so\nthat he cut it in two; and the sword broke into two parts also.\n\"Place the two parts together, and reunite them,\" and Peredur placed\nthem together, and they became entire as they were before.  And a\nsecond time he struck upon the staple, so that both it and the sword\nbroke in two, and as before they reunited.  And the third time he\ngave a like blow, and placed the broken parts together, and neither\nthe staple nor the sword would unite as before.  \"Youth,\" said the\nnobleman, \"come now, and sit down, and my blessing be upon thee.\nThou fightest best with the sword of any man in the kingdom.  Thou\nhast arrived at two-thirds of thy strength, and the other third thou\nhast not yet obtained; and when thou attainest to thy full power,\nnone will be able to contend with thee.  I am thy uncle, thy mother's\nbrother, and I am brother to the man in whose house thou wast last\nnight.\"  Then Peredur and his uncle discoursed together, and he\nbeheld two youths enter the hall, and proceed up to the chamber,\nbearing a spear of mighty size, with three streams of blood flowing\nfrom the point to the ground.  And when all the company saw this,\nthey began wailing and lamenting.  But for all that, the man did not\nbreak off his discourse with Peredur.  And as he did not tell Peredur\nthe meaning of what he saw, he forbore to ask him concerning it.  And\nwhen the clamour had a little subsided, behold two maidens entered,\nwith a large salver between them, in which was a man's head,\nsurrounded by a profusion of blood.  And thereupon the company of the\ncourt made so great an outcry, that it was irksome to be in the same\nhall with them.  But at length they were silent.  And when time was\nthat they should sleep, Peredur was brought into a fair chamber.\n\nAnd the next day, with his uncle's permission, he rode forth.  And he\ncame to a wood, and far within the wood he heard a loud cry, and he\nsaw a beautiful woman with auburn hair, and a horse with a saddle\nupon it, standing near her, and a corpse by her side.  And as she\nstrove to place the corpse upon the horse, it fell to the ground, and\nthereupon she made a great lamentation.  \"Tell me, sister,\" said\nPeredur, \"wherefore art thou bewailing?\"  \"Oh! accursed Peredur,\nlittle pity has my ill-fortune ever met with from thee.\"\n\"Wherefore,\" said Peredur, \"am I accursed?\"  \"Because thou wast the\ncause of thy mother's death; for when thou didst ride forth against\nher will, anguish seized upon her heart, so that she died; and\ntherefore art thou accursed.  And the dwarf and the dwarfess that\nthou sawest at Arthur's Court were the dwarfs of thy father and\nmother; and I am thy foster-sister, and this was my wedded husband,\nand he was slain by the knight that is in the glade in the wood; and\ndo not thou go near him, lest thou shouldest be slain by him\nlikewise.\"  \"My sister, thou dost reproach me wrongfully; through my\nhaving so long remained amongst you, I shall scarcely vanquish him;\nand had I continued longer, it would, indeed, be difficult for me to\nsucceed.  Cease, therefore, thy lamenting, for it is of no avail, and\nI will bury the body, and then I will go in quest of the knight, and\nsee if I can do vengeance upon him.\"  And when he had buried the\nbody, they went to the place where the knight was, and found him\nriding proudly along the glade; and he inquired of Peredur whence he\ncame.  \"I come from Arthur's Court.\"  \"And art thou one of Arthur's\nmen?\"  \"Yes, by my faith.\"  \"A profitable alliance, truly, is that of\nArthur.\"  And without further parlance, they encountered one another,\nand immediately Peredur overthrew the knight, and he besought mercy\nof Peredur.  \"Mercy shalt thou have,\" said he, \"upon these terms,\nthat thou take this woman in marriage, and do her all the honour and\nreverence in thy power, seeing thou hast, without cause, slain her\nwedded husband; and that thou go to Arthur's Court, and shew him that\nit was I that overthrew thee, to do him honour and service; and that\nthou tell him that I will never come to his Court again until I have\nmet with the tall man that is there, to take vengeance upon him for\nhis insult to the dwarf and dwarfess.\"  And he took the knight's\nassurance, that he would perform all this.  Then the knight provided\nthe lady with a horse and garments that were suitable for her, and\ntook her with him to Arthur's Court.  And he told Arthur all that had\noccurred, and gave the defiance to Kai.  And Arthur and all his\nhousehold reproved Kai, for having driven such a youth as Peredur\nfrom his Court.\n\nSaid Owain the son of Urien, \"This youth will never come into the\nCourt until Kai has gone forth from it.\"  \"By my faith,\" said Arthur,\n\"I will search all the deserts in the Island of Britain, until I find\nPeredur, and then let him and his adversary do their utmost to each\nother.\"\n\nThen Peredur rode forward.  And he came to a desert wood, where he\nsaw not the track either of men or animals, and where there was\nnothing but bushes and weeds.  And at the upper end of the wood he\nsaw a vast castle, wherein were many strong towers; and when he came\nnear the gate, he found the weeds taller than he had seen them\nelsewhere.  And he struck the gate with the shaft of his lance, and\nthereupon behold a lean, auburn-haired youth came to an opening in\nthe battlements.  \"Choose thou, chieftain,\" said he, \"whether shall I\nopen the gate unto thee, or shall I announce unto those that are\nchief, that thou art at the gateway?\"  \"Say that I am here,\" said\nPeredur, \"and if it is desired that I should enter, I will go in.\"\nAnd the youth came back, and opened the gate for Peredur.  And when\nhe went into the hall, he beheld eighteen youths, lean and red-\nheaded, of the same height, and of the same aspect, and of the same\ndress, and of the same age as the one who had opened the gate for\nhim.  And they were well skilled in courtesy and in service.  And\nthey disarrayed him.  Then they sat down to discourse.  Thereupon,\nbehold five maidens came from the chamber into the hall.  And Peredur\nwas certain that he had never seen another of so fair an aspect as\nthe chief of the maidens.  And she had an old garment of satin upon\nher, which had once been handsome, but was then so tattered, that her\nskin could be seen through it.  And whiter was her skin than the\nbloom of crystal, and her hair and her two eyebrows were blacker than\njet, and on her cheeks were two red spots, redder than whatever is\nreddest.  And the maiden welcomed Peredur, and put her arms about his\nneck, and made him sit down beside her.  Not long after this he saw\ntwo nuns enter, and a flask full of wine was borne by one, and six\nloaves of white bread by the other.  \"Lady,\" said they, \"Heaven is\nwitness, that there is not so much of food and liquor as this left in\nyonder Convent this night.\"  Then they went to meat, and Peredur\nobserved that the maiden wished to give more of the food and of the\nliquor to him than to any of the others.  \"My sister,\" said Peredur,\n\"I will share out the food and the liquor.\"  \"Not so, my soul,\" said\nshe.  \"By my faith but I will.\"  So Peredur took the bread, and he\ngave an equal portion of it to each alike, as well as a cup full of\nthe liquor.  And when it was time for them to sleep, a chamber was\nprepared for Peredur, and he went to rest.\n\n\"Behold, sister,\" said the youths to the fairest and most exalted of\nthe maidens, \"we have counsel for thee.\"  \"What may it be?\" she\ninquired.  \"Go to the youth that is in the upper chamber, and offer\nto become his wife, or the lady of his love, if it seem well to him.\"\n\"That were indeed unfitting,\" said she.  \"Hitherto I have not been\nthe lady-love of any knight, and to make him such an offer before I\nam wooed by him, that, truly, can I not do.\"  \"By our confession to\nHeaven, unless thou actest thus, we will leave thee here to thy\nenemies, to do as they will with thee.\"  And through fear of this,\nthe maiden went forth; and shedding tears, she proceeded to the\nchamber.  And with the noise of the door opening, Peredur awoke; and\nthe maiden was weeping and lamenting.  \"Tell me, my sister,\" said\nPeredur, \"wherefore dost thou weep?\"  \"I will tell thee, lord,\" said\nshe.  \"My father possessed these dominions as their chief, and this\npalace was his, and with it he held the best earldom in the kingdom;\nthen the son of another earl sought me of my father, and I was not\nwilling to be given unto him, and my father would not give me against\nmy will, either to him or any earl in the world.  And my father had\nno child except myself.  And after my father's death, these dominions\ncame into my own hands, and then was I less willing to accept him\nthan before.  So he made war upon me, and conquered all my\npossessions, except this one house.  And through the valour of the\nmen whom thou hast seen, who are my foster-brothers, and the strength\nof the house, it can never be taken while food and drink remain.  And\nnow our provisions are exhausted; but, as thou hast seen, we have\nbeen fed by the nuns, to whom the country is free.  And at length\nthey also are without supply of food or liquor.  And at no later date\nthan to-morrow, the earl will come against this place with all his\nforces; and if I fall into his power, my fate will be no better than\nto be given over to the grooms of his horses.  Therefore, lord, I am\ncome to offer to place myself in thy hands, that thou mayest succour\nme, either by taking me hence, or by defending me here, whichever may\nseem best unto thee.\"  \"Go, my sister,\" said he, \"and sleep; nor will\nI depart from thee until I do that which thou requirest, or prove\nwhether I can assist thee or not.\"  The maiden went again to rest;\nand the next morning she came to Peredur, and saluted him.  \"Heaven\nprosper thee, my soul, and what tidings dost thou bring?\"  \"None\nother, than that the earl and all his forces have alighted at the\ngate, and I never beheld any place so covered with tents, and\nthronged with knights challenging others to the combat.\"  \"Truly,\"\nsaid Peredur, \"let my horse be made ready.\"  So his horse was\naccoutred, and he arose and sallied forth to the meadow.  And there\nwas a knight riding proudly along the meadow, having raised the\nsignal for battle.  And they encountered, and Peredur threw the\nknight over his horse's crupper to the ground.  And at the close of\nthe day, one of the chief knights came to fight with him, and he\noverthrew him also, so that he besought his mercy.  \"Who art thou?\"\nsaid Peredur.  \"Verily,\" said he, \"I am Master of the Household to\nthe earl.\"  \"And how much of the countess's possessions is there in\nthy power?\"  \"The third part, verily,\" answered he.  \"Then,\" said\nPeredur, \"restore to her the third of her possessions in full, and\nall the profit thou hast made by them, and bring meat and drink for a\nhundred men, with their horses and arms, to her court this night.\nAnd thou shalt remain her captive, unless she wish to take thy life.\"\nAnd this he did forthwith.  And that night the maiden was right\njoyful, and they fared plenteously.\n\nAnd the next day Peredur rode forth to the meadow; and that day he\nvanquished a multitude of the host.  And at the close of the day,\nthere came a proud and stately knight, and Peredur overthrew him, and\nhe besought his mercy.  \"Who art thou?\" said Peredur.  \"I am Steward\nof the Palace,\" said he.  \"And how much of the maiden's possessions\nare under thy control?\"  \"One-third part,\" answered he.  \"Verily,\"\nsaid Peredur, \"thou shalt fully restore to the maiden her\npossessions, and, moreover, thou shalt give her meat and drink for\ntwo hundred men, and their horses and their arms.  And for thyself,\nthou shalt be her captive.\"  And immediately it was so done.\n\nAnd the third day Peredur rode forth to the meadow; and he vanquished\nmore that day than on either of the preceding.  And at the close of\nthe day, an earl came to encounter him, and he overthrew him, and he\nbesought his mercy.  \"Who art thou?\" said Peredur.  \"I am the earl,\"\nsaid he.  \"I will not conceal it from thee.\"  \"Verily,\" said Peredur,\n\"thou shalt restore the whole of the maiden's earldom, and shalt give\nher thine own earldom in addition thereto, and meat and drink for\nthree hundred men, and their horses and arms, and thou thyself shalt\nremain in her power.\"  And thus it was fulfilled.  And Peredur\ntarried three weeks in the country, causing tribute and obedience to\nbe paid to the maiden, and the government to be placed in her hands.\n\"With thy leave,\" said Peredur, \"I will go hence.\"  \"Verily, my\nbrother, desirest thou this?\"  \"Yes, by my faith; and had it not been\nfor love of thee, I should not have been here thus long.\"  \"My soul,\"\nsaid she, \"who art thou?\"  \"I am Peredur the son of Evrawc from the\nNorth; and if ever thou art in trouble or in danger, acquaint me\ntherewith, and if I can, I will protect thee.\"\n\nSo Peredur rode forth.  And far thence there met him a lady, mounted\non a horse that was lean, and covered with sweat; and she saluted the\nyouth.  \"Whence comest thou, my sister?\"  Then she told him the cause\nof her journey.  Now she was the wife of the Lord of the Glade.\n\"Behold,\" said he, \"I am the knight through whom thou art in trouble,\nand he shall repent it, who has treated thee thus.\"  Thereupon,\nbehold a knight rode up, and he inquired of Peredur, if he had seen a\nknight such as he was seeking.  \"Hold thy peace,\" said Peredur, \"I am\nhe whom thou seekest; and by my faith, thou deservest ill of thy\nhousehold for thy treatment of the maiden, for she is innocent\nconcerning me.\"  So they encountered, and they were not long in\ncombat ere Peredur overthrew the knight, and he besought his mercy.\n\"Mercy thou shalt have,\" said Peredur, \"so thou wilt return by the\nway thou camest, and declare that thou holdest the maiden innocent,\nand so that thou wilt acknowledge unto her the reverse thou hast\nsustained at my hands.\"  And the knight plighted him his faith\nthereto.\n\nThen Peredur rode forward.  And above him he beheld a castle, and\nthitherward he went.  And he struck upon the gate with his lance, and\nthen, behold, a comely auburn-haired youth opened the gate, and he\nhad the stature of a warrior, and the years of a boy.  And when\nPeredur came into the hall, there was a tall and stately lady sitting\nin a chair, and many handmaidens around her; and the lady rejoiced at\nhis coming.  And when it was time, they went to meat.  And after\ntheir repast was finished, \"It were well for thee, chieftain,\" said\nshe, \"to go elsewhere to sleep.\"  \"Wherefore can I not sleep here?\"\nsaid Peredur.  \"Nine sorceresses are here, my soul, of the\nsorceresses of Gloucester, and their father and their mother are with\nthem; and unless we can make our escape before daybreak, we shall be\nslain; and already they have conquered and laid waste all the\ncountry, except this one dwelling.\"  \"Behold,\" said Peredur, \"I will\nremain here to-night, and if you are in trouble, I will do you what\nservice I can; but harm shall you not receive from me.\"  So they went\nto rest.  And with the break of day, Peredur heard a dreadful outcry.\nAnd he hastily arose, and went forth in his vest and his doublet,\nwith his sword about his neck, and he saw a sorceress overtake one of\nthe watch, who cried out violently.  Peredur attacked the sorceress,\nand struck her upon the head with his sword, so that he flattened her\nhelmet and her head-piece like a dish upon her head.  \"Thy mercy,\ngoodly Peredur, son of Evrawc, and the mercy of Heaven.\"  \"How\nknowest thou, hag, that I am Peredur?\"  \"By destiny, and the\nforeknowledge that I should suffer harm from thee.  And thou shalt\ntake a horse and armour of me; and with me thou shalt go to learn\nchivalry and the use of thy arms.\"  Said Peredur, \"Thou shalt have\nmercy, if thou pledge thy faith thou wilt never more injure the\ndominions of the Countess.\"  And Peredur took surety of this, and\nwith permission of the Countess, he set forth with the sorceress to\nthe palace of the sorceresses.  And there he remained for three\nweeks, and then he made choice of a horse and arms, and went his way.\n\nAnd in the evening he entered a valley, and at the head of the valley\nhe came to a hermit's cell, and the hermit welcomed him gladly, and\nthere he spent the night.  And in the morning he arose, and when he\nwent forth, behold a shower of snow had fallen the night before, and\na hawk had killed a wild fowl in front of the cell.  And the noise of\nthe horse scared the hawk away, and a raven alighted upon the bird.\nAnd Peredur stood, and compared the blackness of the raven and the\nwhiteness of the snow, and the redness of the blood, to the hair of\nthe lady that best he loved, which was blacker than jet, and to her\nskin which was whiter than the snow, and to the two red spots upon\nher cheeks, which were redder than the blood upon the snow appeared\nto be.\n\nNow Arthur and his household were in search of Peredur.  \"Know ye,\"\nsaid Arthur, \"who is the knight with the long spear that stands by\nthe brook up yonder?\"  \"Lord,\" said one of them, \"I will go and learn\nwho he is.\"  So the youth came to the place where Peredur was, and\nasked him what he did thus, and who he was.  And from the intensity\nwith which he thought upon the lady whom best he loved, he gave him\nno answer.  Then the youth thrust at Peredur with his lance, and\nPeredur turned upon him, and struck him over his horse's crupper to\nthe ground.  And after this, four-and-twenty youths came to him, and\nhe did not answer one more than another, but gave the same reception\nto all, bringing them with one single thrust to the ground.  And then\ncame Kai, and spoke to Peredur rudely and angrily; and Peredur took\nhim with his lance under the jaw, and cast him from him with a\nthrust, so that he broke his arm and his shoulder-blade, and he rode\nover him one-and-twenty times.  And while he lay thus, stunned with\nthe violence of the pain that he had suffered, his horse returned\nback at a wild and prancing pace.  And when the household saw the\nhorse come back without his rider, they rode forth in haste to the\nplace where the encounter had been.  And when they first came there,\nthey thought that Kai was slain; but they found that if he had a\nskilful physician, he yet might live.  And Peredur moved not from his\nmeditation, on seeing the concourse that was around Kai.  And Kai was\nbrought to Arthur's tent, and Arthur caused skilful physicians to\ncome to him.  And Arthur was grieved that Kai had met with this\nreverse, for he loved him greatly.\n\n\"Then,\" said Gwalchmai, \"it is not fitting that any should disturb an\nhonourable knight from his thought unadvisedly; for either he is\npondering some damage that he has sustained, or he is thinking of the\nlady whom best he loves.  And through such ill-advised proceeding,\nperchance this misadventure has befallen him who last met with him.\nAnd if it seem well to thee, lord, I will go and see if this knight\nhath changed from his thought; and if he has, I will ask him\ncourteously to come and visit thee.\"  Then Kai was wroth, and he\nspoke angry and spiteful words.  \"Gwalchmai,\" said he, \"I know that\nthou wilt bring him because he is fatigued.  Little praise and\nhonour, nevertheless, wilt thou have from vanquishing a weary knight,\nwho is tired with fighting.  Yet thus hast thou gained the advantage\nover many.  And while thy speech and thy soft words last, a coat of\nthin linen were armour sufficient for thee, and thou wilt not need to\nbreak either lance or sword in fighting with the knight in the state\nhe is in.\"  Then said Gwalchmai to Kai, \"Thou mightest use more\npleasant words, wert thou so minded:  and it behoves thee not upon me\nto wreak thy wrath and thy displeasure.  Methinks I shall bring the\nknight hither with me without breaking either my arm or my shoulder.\"\nThen said Arthur to Gwalchmai, \"Thou speakest like a wise and prudent\nman; go, and take enough of armour about thee, and choose thy horse.\"\nAnd Gwalchmai accoutred himself and rode forward hastily to the place\nwhere Peredur was.\n\nAnd Peredur was resting on the shaft of his spear, pondering the same\nthought, and Gwalchmai came to him without any signs of hostility,\nand said to him, \"If I thought that it would be as agreeable to thee\nas it would be to me, I would converse with thee.  I have also a\nmessage from Arthur unto thee, to pray thee to come and visit him.\nAnd two men have been before on this errand.\"  \"That is true,\" said\nPeredur, \"and uncourteously they came.  They attacked me, and I was\nannoyed thereat, for it was not pleasing to me to be drawn from the\nthought that I was in, for I was thinking of the lady whom best I\nlove, and thus was she brought to my mind: --I was looking upon the\nsnow, and upon the raven, and upon the drops of the blood of the bird\nthat the hawk had killed upon the snow.  And I bethought me that her\nwhiteness was like that of the snow, and that the blackness of her\nhair and her eyebrows like that of the raven, and that the two red\nspots upon her cheeks were like the two drops of blood.\"  Said\nGwalchmai, \"This was not an ungentle thought, and I should marvel if\nit were pleasant to thee to be drawn from it.\"  \"Tell me,\" said\nPeredur, \"is Kai in Arthur's Court?\"  \"He is,\" said he, \"and behold\nhe is the knight that fought with thee last; and it would have been\nbetter for him had he not come, for his arm and his shoulder-blade\nwere broken with the fall which he had from thy spear.\"  \"Verily,\"\nsaid Peredur, \"I am not sorry to have thus begun to avenge the insult\nto the dwarf and dwarfess.\"  Then Gwalchmai marvelled to hear him\nspeak of the dwarf and the dwarfess; and he approached him, and threw\nhis arms around his neck, and asked him what was his name.  \"Peredur\nthe son of Evrawc am I called,\" said he; \"and thou, Who art thou?\"\n\"I am called Gwalchmai,\" he replied.  \"I am right glad to meet with\nthee,\" said Peredur, \"for in every country where I have been I have\nheard of thy fame for prowess and uprightness, and I solicit thy\nfellowship.\"  \"Thou shalt have it, by my faith, and grant me thine,\"\nsaid he, \"Gladly will I do so,\" answered Peredur.\n\nSo they rode forth together joyfully towards the place where Arthur\nwas, and when Kai saw them coming, he said, \"I knew that Gwalchmai\nneeded not to fight the knight.  And it is no wonder that he should\ngain fame; more can he do by his fair words than I by the strength of\nmy arm.\"  And Peredur went with Gwalchmai to his tent, and they took\noff their armour.  And Peredur put on garments like those that\nGwalchmai wore, and they went together unto Arthur, and saluted him.\n\"Behold, lord,\" said Gwalchmai, \"him whom thou hast sought so long.\"\n\"Welcome unto thee, chieftain,\" said Arthur.  \"With me thou shalt\nremain; and had I known thy valour had been such, thou shouldst not\nhave left me as thou didst; nevertheless, this was predicted of thee\nby the dwarf and the dwarfess, whom Kai ill-treated and whom thou\nhast avenged.\"  And hereupon, behold there came the Queen and her\nhandmaidens, and Peredur saluted them.  And they were rejoiced to see\nhim, and bade him welcome.  And Arthur did him great honour and\nrespect, and they returned towards Caerlleon.\n\nAnd the first night Peredur came to Caerlleon to Arthur's Court, and\nas he walked in the city after his repast, behold, there met him\nAngharad Law Eurawc.  \"By my faith, sister,\" said Peredur, \"thou art\na beauteous and lovely maiden; and, were it pleasing to thee, I could\nlove thee above all women.\"  \"I pledge my faith,\" said she, \"that I\ndo not love thee, nor will I ever do so.\"  \"I also pledge my faith,\"\nsaid Peredur, \"that I will never speak a word to any Christian again,\nuntil thou come to love me above all men.\"\n\nThe next day Peredur went forth by the high road, along a mountain-\nridge, and he saw a valley of a circular form, the confines of which\nwere rocky and wooded.  And the flat part of the valley was in\nmeadows, and there were fields betwixt the meadows and the wood.  And\nin the bosom of the wood he saw large black houses of uncouth\nworkmanship.  And he dismounted, and led his horse towards the wood.\nAnd a little way within the wood he saw a rocky ledge, along which\nthe road lay.  And upon the ledge was a lion bound by a chain, and\nsleeping.  And beneath the lion he saw a deep pit of immense size,\nfull of the bones of men and animals.  And Peredur drew his sword and\nstruck the lion, so that he fell into the mouth of the pit and hung\nthere by the chain; and with a second blow he struck the chain and\nbroke it, and the lion fell into the pit; and Peredur led his horse\nover the rocky ledge, until he came into the valley.  And in the\ncentre of the valley he saw a fair castle, and he went towards it.\nAnd in the meadow by the castle he beheld a huge grey man sitting,\nwho was larger than any man he had ever before seen.  And two young\npages were shooting the hilts of their daggers, of the bone of the\nsea-horse.  And one of the pages had red hair, and the other auburn.\nAnd they went before him to the place where the grey man was, and\nPeredur saluted him.  And the grey man said, \"Disgrace to the beard\nof my porter.\"  Then Peredur understood that the porter was the\nlion.--And the grey man and the pages went together into the castle,\nand Peredur accompanied them; and he found it a fair and noble place.\nAnd they proceeded to the hall, and the tables were already laid, and\nupon them was abundance of food and liquor.  And thereupon he saw an\naged woman and a young woman come from the chamber; and they were the\nmost stately women he had ever seen.  Then they washed and went to\nmeat, and the grey man sat in the upper seat at the head of the\ntable, and the aged woman next to him.  And Peredur and the maiden\nwere placed together, and the two young pages served them.  And the\nmaiden gazed sorrowfully upon Peredur, and Peredur asked the maiden\nwherefore she was sad.  \"For thee, my soul; for, from when I first\nbeheld thee, I have loved thee above all men.  And it pains me to\nknow that so gentle a youth as thou should have such a doom as awaits\nthee to-morrow.  Sawest thou the numerous black houses in the bosom\nof the wood?  All these belong to the vassals of the grey man yonder,\nwho is my father.  And they are all giants.  And to-morrow they will\nrise up against thee, and will slay thee.  And the Round Valley is\nthis valley called.\"  \"Listen, fair maiden, wilt thou contrive that\nmy horse and arms be in the same lodging with me to-night?\"  \"Gladly\nwill I cause it so to be, by Heaven, if I can.\"\n\nAnd when it was time for them to sleep rather than to carouse, they\nwent to rest.  And the maiden caused Peredur's horse and arms to be\nin the same lodging with him.  And the next morning Peredur heard a\ngreat tumult of men and horses around the castle.  And Peredur arose,\nand armed himself and his horse, and went to the meadow.  Then the\naged woman and the maiden came to the grey man:  \"Lord,\" said they,\n\"take the word of the youth, that he will never disclose what he has\nseen in this place, and we will be his sureties that he keep it.\"  \"I\nwill not do so, by my faith,\" said the grey man.  So Peredur fought\nwith the host, and towards evening he had slain the one-third of them\nwithout receiving any hurt himself.  Then said the aged woman,\n\"Behold, many of thy host have been slain by the youth; do thou,\ntherefore, grant him mercy.\"  \"I will not grant it, by my faith,\"\nsaid he.  And the aged woman and the fair maiden were upon the\nbattlements of the castle, looking forth.  And at that juncture,\nPeredur encountered the yellow-haired youth and slew him.  \"Lord,\"\nsaid the maiden, \"grant the young man mercy.\"  \"That will I not do,\nby Heaven,\" he replied; and thereupon Peredur attacked the auburn-\nhaired youth, and slew him likewise.  \"It were better that thou hadst\naccorded mercy to the youth before he had slain thy two sons; for now\nscarcely wilt thou thyself escape from him.\"  \"Go, maiden, and\nbeseech the youth to grant mercy unto us, for we yield ourselves into\nhis hands.\"  So the maiden came to the place where Peredur was, and\nbesought mercy for her father, and for all such of his vassals as had\nescaped alive.  \"Thou shalt have it, on condition that thy father and\nall that are under him go and render homage to Arthur, and tell him\nthat it was his vassal Peredur that did him this service.\"  \"This\nwill we do willingly, by Heaven.\"  \"And you shall also receive\nbaptism; and I will send to Arthur, and beseech him to bestow this\nvalley upon thee and upon thy heirs after thee for ever.\"  Then they\nwent in, and the grey man and the tall woman saluted Peredur.  And\nthe grey man said unto him, \"Since I have possessed this valley I\nhave not seen any Christian depart with his life, save thyself.  And\nwe will go to do homage to Arthur, and to embrace the faith and be\nbaptized.\"  Then said Peredur, \"To Heaven I render thanks that I have\nnot broken my vow to the lady that best I love, which was, that I\nwould not speak one word unto any Christian.\"\n\nThat night they tarried there.  And the next day, in the morning, the\ngrey man, with his company, set forth to Arthur's Court; and they did\nhomage unto Arthur, and he caused them to be baptized.  And the grey\nman told Arthur that it was Peredur that had vanquished them.  And\nArthur gave the valley to the grey man and his company, to hold it of\nhim as Peredur had besought.  And with Arthur's permission, the grey\nman went back to the Round Valley.\n\nPeredur rode forward next day, and he traversed a vast tract of\ndesert, in which no dwellings were.  And at length he came to a\nhabitation, mean and small.  And there he heard that there was a\nserpent that lay upon a gold ring, and suffered none to inhabit the\ncountry for seven miles around.  And Peredur came to the place where\nhe heard the serpent was.  And angrily, furiously, and desperately\nfought he with the serpent; and at last he killed it, and took away\nthe ring.  And thus he was for a long time without speaking a word to\nany Christian.  And therefrom he lost his colour and his aspect,\nthrough extreme longing after the Court of Arthur, and the society of\nthe lady whom best he loved, and of his companions.  Then he\nproceeded forward to Arthur's Court, and on the road there met him\nArthur's household going on a particular errand, with Kai at their\nhead.  And Peredur knew them all, but none of the household\nrecognized him.  \"Whence comest thou, chieftain?\" said Kai.  And this\nhe asked him twice and three times, and he answered him not.  And Kai\nthrust him through the thigh with his lance.  And lest he should be\ncompelled to speak, and to break his vow, he went on without\nstopping.  \"Then,\" said Gwalchmai, \"I declare to Heaven, Kai, that\nthou hast acted ill in committing such an outrage on a youth like\nthis, who cannot speak.\"\n\nAnd Gwalchmai returned back to Arthur's Court.  \"Lady,\" said he to\nGwenhwyvar, \"seest thou how wicked an outrage Kai has committed upon\nthis youth who cannot speak; for Heaven's sake, and for mine, cause\nhim to have medical care before I come back, and I will repay thee\nthe charge.\"\n\nAnd before the men returned from their errand, a knight came to the\nmeadow beside Arthur's Palace, to dare some one to the encounter.\nAnd his challenge was accepted; and Peredur fought with him, and\noverthrew him.  And for a week he overthrew one knight every day.\n\nAnd one day, Arthur and his household were going to Church, and they\nbeheld a knight who had raised the signal for combat.  \"Verily,\" said\nArthur, \"by the valour of men, I will not go hence until I have my\nhorse and my arms to overthrow yonder boor.\"  Then went the\nattendants to fetch Arthur's horse and arms.  And Peredur met the\nattendants as they were going back, and he took the horse and arms\nfrom them, and proceeded to the meadow; and all those who saw him\narise and go to do battle with the knight, went upon the tops of the\nhouses, and the mounds, and the high places, to behold the combat.\nAnd Peredur beckoned with his hand to the knight to commence the\nfight.  And the knight thrust at him, but he was not thereby moved\nfrom where he stood.  And Peredur spurred his horse, and ran at him\nwrathfully, furiously, fiercely, desperately, and with mighty rage,\nand he gave him a thrust, deadly-wounding, severe, furious, adroit,\nand strong, under his jaw, and raised him out of his saddle, and cast\nhim a long way from him.  And Peredur went back, and left the horse\nand the arms with the attendant as before, and he went on foot to the\nPalace.\n\nThen Peredur went by the name of the Dumb Youth.  And behold,\nAngharad Law Eurawc met him.  \"I declare to Heaven, chieftain,\" said\nshe, \"woful is it that thou canst not speak; for couldst thou speak,\nI would love thee best of all men; and by my faith, although thou\ncanst not, I do love thee above all.\"  \"Heaven reward thee, my\nsister,\" said Peredur, \"by my faith I also do love thee.\"  Thereupon\nit was known that he was Peredur.  And then he held fellowship with\nGwalchmai, and Owain the son of Urien, and all the household, and he\nremained in Arthur's Court.\n\n\nArthur was in Caerlleon upon Usk; and he went to hunt, and Peredur\nwent with him.  And Peredur let loose his dog upon a hart, and the\ndog killed the hart in a desert place.  And a short space from him he\nsaw signs of a dwelling, and towards the dwelling he went, and he\nbeheld a hall, and at the door of the hall he found bald swarthy\nyouths playing at chess.  And when he entered, he beheld three\nmaidens sitting on a bench, and they were all clothed alike, as\nbecame persons of high rank.  And he came, and sat by them upon the\nbench; and one of the maidens looked steadfastly upon Peredur, and\nwept.  And Peredur asked her wherefore she was weeping.  \"Through\ngrief, that I should see so fair a youth as thou art, slain.\"  \"Who\nwill slay me?\" inquired Peredur.  \"If thou art so daring as to remain\nhere to-night, I will tell thee.\"  \"How great soever my danger may be\nfrom remaining here, I will listen unto thee.\"  \"This Palace is owned\nby him who is my father,\" said the maiden, \"and he slays every one\nwho comes hither without his leave.\"  \"What sort of a man is thy\nfather, that he is able to slay every one thus?\"  \"A man who does\nviolence and wrong unto his neighbours, and who renders justice unto\nnone.\"  And hereupon he saw the youths arise and clear the chessmen\nfrom the board.  And he heard a great tumult; and after the tumult\nthere came in a huge black one-eyed man, and the maidens arose to\nmeet him.  And they disarrayed him, and he went and sat down; and\nafter he had rested and pondered awhile, he looked at Peredur, and\nasked who the knight was.  \"Lord,\" said one of the maidens, \"he is\nthe fairest and gentlest youth that ever thou didst see.  And for the\nsake of Heaven, and of thine own dignity, have patience with him.\"\n\"For thy sake I will have patience, and I will grant him his life\nthis night.\"  Then Peredur came towards them to the fire, and partook\nof food and liquor, and entered into discourse with the ladies.  And\nbeing elated with the liquor, he said to the black man, \"It is a\nmarvel to me, so mighty as thou sayest thou art, who could have put\nout thine eye.\"  \"It is one of my habits,\" said the black man, \"that\nwhosoever puts to me the question which thou hast asked, shall not\nescape with his life, either as a free gift or for a price.\"  \"Lord,\"\nsaid the maiden, \"whatsoever he may say to thee in jest, and through\nthe excitement of liquor, make good that which thou saidst and didst\npromise me just now.\"  \"I will do so, gladly, for thy sake,\" said he.\n\"Willingly will I grant him his life this night.\"  And that night\nthus they remained.\n\nAnd the next day the black man got up, and put on his armour, and\nsaid to Peredur, \"Arise, man, and suffer death.\"  And Peredur said\nunto him, \"Do one of two things, black man; if thou wilt fight with\nme, either throw off thy own armour, or give arms to me, that I may\nencounter thee.\"  \"Ha, man,\" said he, \"couldst thou fight, if thou\nhadst arms?  Take, then, what arms thou dost choose.\"  And thereupon\nthe maiden came to Peredur with such arms as pleased him; and he\nfought with the black man, and forced him to crave his mercy.  \"Black\nman, thou shalt have mercy, provided thou tell me who thou art, and\nwho put out thine eye.\"  \"Lord, I will tell thee; I lost it in\nfighting with the Black Serpent of the Carn.  There is a mound, which\nis called the Mound of Mourning; and on the mound there is a carn,\nand in the carn there is a serpent, and on the tail of the serpent\nthere is a stone, and the virtues of the stone are such, that\nwhosoever should hold it in one hand, in the other he will have as\nmuch gold as he may desire.  And in fighting with this serpent was it\nthat I lost my eye.  And the Black Oppressor am I called.  And for\nthis reason I am called the Black Oppressor, that there is not a\nsingle man around me whom I have not oppressed, and justice have I\ndone unto none.\"  \"Tell me,\" said Peredur, \"how far is it hence?\"\n\"The same day that thou settest forth, thou wilt come to the Palace\nof the Sons of the King of the Tortures.\"  \"Wherefore are they called\nthus?\"  \"The Addanc of the Lake slays them once every day.  When thou\ngoest thence, thou wilt come to the Court of the Countess of the\nAchievements.\"  \"What achievements are there?\" asked Peredur.  \"Three\nhundred men there are in her household, and unto every stranger that\ncomes to the Court, the achievements of her household are related.\nAnd this is the manner of it,--the three hundred men of the household\nsit next unto the Lady; and that not through disrespect unto the\nguests, but that they may relate the achievements of the household.\nAnd the day that thou goest thence, thou wilt reach the Mound of\nMourning, and round about the mound there are the owners of three\nhundred tents guarding the serpent.\"  \"Since thou hast, indeed, been\nan oppressor so long,\" said Peredur, \"I will cause that thou continue\nso no longer.\"  So he slew him.\n\nThen the maiden spoke, and began to converse with him.  \"If thou wast\npoor when thou camest here, henceforth thou wilt be rich through the\ntreasure of the black man whom thou hast slain.  Thou seest the many\nlovely maidens that there are in this Court; thou shalt have her whom\nthou best likest for the lady of thy love.\"  \"Lady, I came not hither\nfrom my country to woo; but match yourselves as it liketh you with\nthe comely youths I see here; and none of your goods do I desire, for\nI need them not.\"  Then Peredur rode forward, and he came to the\nPalace of the Sons of the King of the Tortures; and when he entered\nthe Palace, he saw none but women; and they rose up, and were joyful\nat his coming; and as they began to discourse with him, he beheld a\ncharger arrive, with a saddle upon it, and a corpse in the saddle.\nAnd one of the women arose, and took the corpse from the saddle, and\nanointed it in a vessel of warm water, which was below the door, and\nplaced precious balsam upon it; and the man rose up alive, and came\nto the place where Peredur was, and greeted him, and was joyful to\nsee him.  And two other men came in upon their saddles, and the\nmaiden treated these two in the same manner as she had done the\nfirst.  Then Peredur asked the chieftain wherefore it was thus.  And\nthey told him, that there was an Addanc in a cave, which slew them\nonce every day.  And thus they remained that night.\n\nAnd next morning the youths arose to sally forth, and Peredur\nbesought them, for the sake of the ladies of their love, to permit\nhim to go with them; but they refused him, saying, \"If thou shouldst\nbe slain there, thou hast none to bring thee back to life again.\"\nAnd they rode forward, and Peredur followed after them; and, after\nthey had disappeared out of his sight, he came to a mound, whereon\nsat the fairest lady he had ever beheld.  \"I know thy quest,\" said\nshe; \"thou art going to encounter the Addanc, and he will slay thee,\nand that not by courage, but by craft.  He has a cave, and at the\nentrance of the cave there is a stone pillar, and he sees every one\nthat enters, and none see him; and from behind the pillar he slays\nevery one with a poisonous dart.  And if thou wouldst pledge me thy\nfaith to love me above all women, I would give thee a stone, by which\nthou shouldst see him when thou goest in, and he should not see\nthee.\"  \"I will, by my troth,\" said Peredur, \"for when first I beheld\nthee I loved thee; and where shall I seek thee?\"  \"When thou seekest\nme, seek towards India.\"  And the maiden vanished, after placing the\nstone in Peredur's hand.\n\nAnd he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the\nborders of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were\nlevel meadows.  And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white\nsheep, and on the other a flock of black sheep.  And whenever one of\nthe white sheep bleated, one of the black sheep would cross over and\nbecome white; and when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the\nwhite sheep would cross over and become black.  And he saw a tall\ntree by the side of the river, one half of which was in flames from\nthe root to the top, and the other half was green and in full leaf.\nAnd nigh thereto he saw a youth sitting upon a mound, and two\ngreyhounds, white-breasted and spotted, in leashes, lying by his\nside.  And certain was he that he had never seen a youth of so royal\na bearing as he.  And in the wood opposite he heard hounds raising a\nherd of deer.  And Peredur saluted the youth, and the youth greeted\nhim in return.  And there were three roads leading from the mound;\ntwo of them were wide roads, and the third was more narrow.  And\nPeredur inquired where the three roads went.  \"One of them goes to my\npalace,\" said the youth; \"and one of two things I counsel thee to do;\neither to proceed to my palace, which is before thee, and where thou\nwilt find my wife, or else to remain here to see the hounds chasing\nthe roused deer from the wood to the plain.  And thou shalt see the\nbest greyhounds thou didst ever behold, and the boldest in the chase,\nkill them by the water beside us; and when it is time to go to meat,\nmy page will come with my horse to meet me, and thou shalt rest in my\npalace to-night.\"  \"Heaven reward thee; but I cannot tarry, for\nonward must I go.\"  \"The other road leads to the town, which is near\nhere, and wherein food and liquor may be bought; and the road which\nis narrower than the others goes towards the cave of the Addanc.\"\n\"With thy permission, young man, I will go that way.\"\n\nAnd Peredur went towards the cave.  And he took the stone in his left\nhand, and his lance in his right.  And as he went in he perceived the\nAddanc, and he pierced him through with his lance, and cut off his\nhead.  And as he came from the cave, behold the three companions were\nat the entrance; and they saluted Peredur, and told him that there\nwas a prediction that he should slay that monster.  And Peredur gave\nthe head to the young men, and they offered him in marriage whichever\nof the three sisters he might choose, and half their kingdom with\nher.  \"I came not hither to woo,\" said Peredur, \"but if peradventure\nI took a wife, I should prefer your sister to all others.\"  And\nPeredur rode forward, and he heard a noise behind him.  And he looked\nback, and saw a man upon a red horse, with red armour upon him; and\nthe man rode up by his side, and saluted him, and wished him the\nfavour of Heaven and of man.  And Peredur greeted the youth kindly.\n\"Lord, I come to make a request unto thee.\"  \"What wouldest thou?\"\n\"That thou shouldest take me as thine attendant.\"  \"Whom then should\nI take as my attendant, if I did so?\"  \"I will not conceal from thee\nwhat kindred I am of.  Etlym Gleddyv Coch am I called, an Earl from\nthe East Country.\"  \"I marvel that thou shouldest offer to become\nattendant to a man whose possessions are no greater than thine own;\nfor I have but an earldom like thyself.  But since thou desirest to\nbe my attendant, I will take thee joyfully.\"\n\nAnd they went forward to the Court of the Countess, and all they of\nthe Court were glad at their coming; and they were told it was not\nthrough disrespect they were placed below the household, but that\nsuch was the usage of the Court.  For, whoever should overthrow the\nthree hundred men of her household, would sit next the Countess, and\nshe would love him above all men.  And Peredur having overthrown the\nthree hundred men of her household, sat down beside her, and the\nCountess said, \"I thank Heaven that I have a youth so fair and so\nvaliant as thou, since I have not obtained the man whom best I love.\"\n\"Who is he whom best thou lovest?\"  \"By my faith, Etlym Gleddyv Coch\nis the man whom I love best, and I have never seen him.\"  \"Of a\ntruth, Etlym is my companion; and behold here he is, and for his sake\ndid I come to joust with thy household.  And he could have done so\nbetter than I, had it pleased him.  And I do give thee unto him.\"\n\"Heaven reward thee, fair youth, and I will take the man whom I love\nabove all others.\"  And the Countess became Etlym's bride from that\nmoment.\n\nAnd the next day Peredur set forth towards the Mound of Mourning.\n\"By thy hand, lord, but I will go with thee,\" said Etlym.  Then they\nwent forwards till they came in sight of the mound and the tents.\n\"Go unto yonder men,\" said Peredur to Etlym, \"and desire them to come\nand do me homage.\"  So Etlym went unto them, and said unto them\nthus,--\"Come and do homage to my lord.\"  \"Who is thy lord?\" said\nthey.  \"Peredur with the long lance is my lord,\" said Etlym.  \"Were\nit permitted to slay a messenger, thou shouldest not go back to thy\nlord alive, for making unto Kings, and Earls, and Barons so arrogant\na demand as to go and do him homage.\"  Peredur desired him to go back\nto them, and to give them their choice, either to do him homage, or\nto do battle with him.  And they chose rather to do battle.  And that\nday Peredur overthrew the owners of a hundred tents; and the next day\nhe overthrew the owners of a hundred more; and the third day the\nremaining hundred took counsel to do homage to Peredur.  And Peredur\ninquired of them, wherefore they were there.  And they told him they\nwere guarding the serpent until he should die.  \"For then should we\nfight for the stone among ourselves, and whoever should be conqueror\namong us would have the stone.\"  \"Await here,\" said Peredur, \"and I\nwill go to encounter the serpent.\"  \"Not so, lord,\" said they; \"we\nwill go altogether to encounter the serpent.\"  \"Verily,\" said\nPeredur, \"that will I not permit; for if the serpent be slain, I\nshall derive no more fame therefrom than one of you.\"  Then he went\nto the place where the serpent was, and slew it, and came back to\nthem, and said, \"Reckon up what you have spent since you have been\nhere, and I will repay you to the full.\"  And he paid to each what he\nsaid was his claim.  And he required of them only that they should\nacknowledge themselves his vassals.  And he said to Etlym, \"Go back\nunto her whom thou lovest best, and I will go forwards, and I will\nreward thee for having been my attendant.\"  And he gave Etlym the\nstone.  \"Heaven repay thee and prosper thee,\" said Etlym.\n\nAnd Peredur rode thence, and he came to the fairest valley he had\never seen, through which ran a river; and there he beheld many tents\nof various colours.  And he marvelled still more at the number of\nwater-mills and of wind-mills that he saw.  And there rode up with\nhim a tall auburn-haired man, in workman's garb, and Peredur inquired\nof him who he was.  \"I am the chief miller,\" said he, \"of all the\nmills yonder.\"  \"Wilt thou give me lodging?\" said Peredur.  \"I will,\ngladly,\" he answered.  And Peredur came to the miller's house, and\nthe miller had a fair and pleasant dwelling.  And Peredur asked money\nas a loan from the miller, that he might buy meat and liquor for\nhimself and for the household, and he promised that he would pay him\nagain ere he went thence.  And he inquired of the miller, wherefore\nsuch a multitude was there assembled.  Said the miller to Peredur,\n\"One thing is certain:  either thou art a man from afar, or thou art\nbeside thyself.  The Empress of Cristinobyl the Great is here; and\nshe will have no one but the man who is most valiant; for riches does\nshe not require.  And it was impossible to bring food for so many\nthousands as are here, therefore were all these mills constructed.\"\nAnd that night they took their rest.\n\nAnd the next day Peredur arose, and he equipped himself and his horse\nfor the tournament.  And among the other tents he beheld one, which\nwas the fairest he had ever seen.  And he saw a beauteous maiden\nleaning her head out of a window of the tent, and he had never seen a\nmaiden more lovely than she.  And upon her was a garment of satin.\nAnd he gazed fixedly on the maiden, and began to love her greatly.\nAnd he remained there, gazing upon the maiden from morning until mid-\nday, and from mid-day until evening; and then the tournament was\nended and he went to his lodging and drew off his armour.  Then he\nasked money of the miller as a loan, and the miller's wife was wroth\nwith Peredur; nevertheless, the miller lent him the money.  And the\nnext day he did in like manner as he had done the day before.  And at\nnight he came to his lodging, and took money as a loan from the\nmiller.  And the third day, as he was in the same place, gazing upon\nthe maiden, he felt a hard blow between the neck and the shoulder,\nfrom the edge of an axe.  And when he looked behind him, he saw that\nit was the miller; and the miller said to him, \"Do one of two things:\neither turn thy head from hence, or go to the tournament.\"  And\nPeredur smiled on the miller, and went to the tournament; and all\nthat encountered him that day he overthrew.  And as many as he\nvanquished he sent as a gift to the Empress, and their horses and\narms he sent as a gift to the wife of the miller, in payment of the\nborrowed money.  Peredur attended the tournament until all were\noverthrown, and he sent all the men to the prison of the Empress, and\nthe horses and arms to the wife of the miller, in payment of the\nborrowed money.  And the Empress sent to the Knight of the Mill, to\nask him to come and visit her.  And Peredur went not for the first\nnor for the second message.  And the third time she sent a hundred\nknights to bring him against his will, and they went to him and told\nhim their mission from the Empress.  And Peredur fought well with\nthem, and caused them to be bound like stags, and thrown into the\nmill-dyke.  And the Empress sought advice of a wise man who was in\nher counsel; and he said to her, \"With thy permission, I will go to\nhim myself.\"  So he came to Peredur, and saluted him, and besought\nhim, for the sake of the lady of his love, to come and visit the\nEmpress.  And they went, together with the miller.  And Peredur went\nand sat down in the outer chamber of the tent, and she came and\nplaced herself by his side.  And there was but little discourse\nbetween them.  And Peredur took his leave, and went to his lodging.\n\nAnd the next day he came to visit her, and when he came into the tent\nthere was no one chamber less decorated than the others.  And they\nknew not where he would sit.  And Peredur went and sat beside the\nEmpress, and discoursed with her courteously.  And while they were\nthus, they beheld a black man enter with a goblet full of wine in his\nhand.  And he dropped upon his knee before the Empress, and besought\nher to give it to no one who would not fight with him for it.  And\nshe looked upon Peredur.  \"Lady,\" said he, \"bestow on me the goblet.\"\nAnd Peredur drank the wine, and gave the goblet to the miller's wife.\nAnd while they were thus, behold there entered a black man of larger\nstature than the other, with a wild beast's claw in his hand, wrought\ninto the form of a goblet and filled with wine.  And he presented it\nto the Empress, and besought her to give it to no one but the man who\nwould fight with him.  \"Lady,\" said Peredur, \"bestow it on me.\"  And\nshe gave it to him.  And Peredur drank the wine, and sent the goblet\nto the wife of the miller.  And while they were thus, behold a rough-\nlooking, crisp-haired man, taller than either of the others, came in\nwith a bowl in his hand full of wine; and he bent upon his knee, and\ngave it into the hands of the Empress, and he besought her to give it\nto none but him who would fight with him for it; and she gave it to\nPeredur, and he sent it to the miller's wife.  And that night Peredur\nreturned to his lodging; and the next day he accoutred himself and\nhis horse, and went to the meadow and slew the three men.  Then\nPeredur proceeded to the tent, and the Empress said to him, \"Goodly\nPeredur, remember the faith thou didst pledge me when I gave thee the\nstone, and thou didst kill the Addanc.\"  \"Lady,\" answered he, \"thou\nsayest truth, I do remember it.\"  And Peredur was entertained by the\nEmpress fourteen years, as the story relates.\n\n\nArthur was at Caerlleon upon Usk, his principal palace; and in the\ncentre of the floor of the hall were four men sitting on a carpet of\nvelvet, Owain the son of Urien, and Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, and\nHowel the son of Emyr Llydaw, and Peredur of the long lance.  And\nthereupon they saw a black curly-headed maiden enter, riding upon a\nyellow mule, with jagged thongs in her hand to urge it on; and having\na rough and hideous aspect.  Blacker were her face and her two hands\nthan the blackest iron covered with pitch; and her hue was not more\nfrightful than her form.  High cheeks had she, and a face lengthened\ndownwards, and a short nose with distended nostrils.  And one eye was\nof a piercing mottled grey, and the other was as black as jet, deep-\nsunk in her head.  And her teeth were long and yellow, more yellow\nwere they than the flower of the broom.  And her stomach rose from\nthe breast-bone, higher than her chin.  And her back was in the shape\nof a crook, and her legs were large and bony.  And her figure was\nvery thin and spare, except her feet and her legs, which were of huge\nsize.  And she greeted Arthur and all his household except Peredur.\nAnd to Peredur she spoke harsh and angry words.  \"Peredur, I greet\nthee not, seeing that thou dost not merit it.  Blind was fate in\ngiving thee fame and favour.  When thou wast in the Court of the Lame\nKing, and didst see there the youth bearing the streaming spear, from\nthe points of which were drops of blood flowing in streams, even to\nthe hand of the youth, and many other wonders likewise, thou didst\nnot inquire their meaning nor their cause.  Hadst thou done so, the\nKing would have been restored to health, and his dominions to peace.\nWhereas from henceforth, he will have to endure battles and\nconflicts, and his knights will perish, and wives will be widowed,\nand maidens will be left portionless, and all this is because of\nthee.\"  Then said she unto Arthur, \"May it please thee, lord, my\ndwelling is far hence, in the stately castle of which thou hast\nheard, and therein are five hundred and sixty-six knights of the\norder of Chivalry, and the lady whom best he loves with each; and\nwhoever would acquire fame in arms, and encounters, and conflicts, he\nwill gain it there, if he deserve it.  And whoso would reach the\nsummit of fame and of honour, I know where he may find it.  There is\na castle on a lofty mountain, and there is a maiden therein, and she\nis detained a prisoner there, and whoever shall set her free will\nattain the summit of the fame of the world.\"  And thereupon she rode\naway.\n\nSaid Gwalchmai, \"By my faith, I will not rest tranquilly until I have\nproved if I can release the maiden.\"  And many of Arthur's household\njoined themselves with him.  Then, likewise, said Peredur, \"By my\nfaith, I will not rest tranquilly until I know the story and the\nmeaning of the lance whereof the black maiden spoke.\"  And while they\nwere equipping themselves, behold a knight came to the gate.  And he\nhad the size and the strength of a warrior, and was equipped with\narms and habiliments.  And he went forward, and saluted Arthur and\nall his household, except Gwalchmai.  And the knight had upon his\nshoulder a shield, ingrained with gold, with a fesse of azure blue\nupon it, and his whole armour was of the same hue.  And he said to\nGwalchmai, \"Thou didst slay my lord by thy treachery and deceit, and\nthat will I prove upon thee.\"  Then Gwalchmai rose up.  \"Behold,\"\nsaid he, \"here is my gage against thee, to maintain, either in this\nplace or wherever else thou wilt, that I am not a traitor or\ndeceiver.\"  \"Before the King whom I obey, will I that my encounter\nwith thee take place,\" said the knight.  \"Willingly,\" said Gwalchmai;\n\"go forward, and I will follow thee.\"  So the knight went forth, and\nGwalchmai accoutred himself, and there was offered unto him abundance\nof armour, but he would take none but his own.  And when Gwalchmai\nand Peredur were equipped, they set forth to follow him, by reason of\ntheir fellowship and of the great friendship that was between them.\nAnd they did not go after him in company together, but each went his\nown way.\n\nAt the dawn of day Gwalchmai came to a valley, and in the valley he\nsaw a fortress, and within the fortress a vast palace and lofty\ntowers around it.  And he beheld a knight coming out to hunt from the\nother side, mounted on a spirited black snorting palfrey, that\nadvanced at a prancing pace, proudly stepping, and nimbly bounding,\nand sure of foot; and this was the man to whom the palace belonged.\nAnd Gwalchmai saluted him.  \"Heaven prosper thee, chieftain,\" said\nhe, \"and whence comest thou?\"  \"I come,\" answered Gwalchmai, \"from\nthe Court of Arthur.\"  \"And art thou Arthur's vassal?\"  \"Yes, by my\nfaith,\" said Gwalchmai.  \"I will give thee good counsel,\" said the\nknight.  \"I see that thou art tired and weary; go unto my palace, if\nit may please thee, and tarry there to-night.\"  \"Willingly, lord,\"\nsaid he, \"and Heaven reward thee.\"  \"Take this ring as a token to the\nporter, and go forward to yonder tower, and therein thou wilt find my\nsister.\"  And Gwalchmai went to the gate, and showed the ring, and\nproceeded to the tower.  And on entering he beheld a large blazing\nfire, burning without smoke and with a bright and lofty flame, and a\nbeauteous and stately maiden was sitting on a chair by the fire.  And\nthe maiden was glad at his coming, and welcomed him, and advanced to\nmeet him.  And he went and sat beside the maiden, and they took their\nrepast.  And when their repast was over, they discoursed pleasantly\ntogether.  And while they were thus, behold there entered a venerable\nhoary-headed man.  \"Ah! base girl,\" said he, \"if thou didst think it\nwas right for thee to entertain and to sit by yonder man, thou\nwouldest not do so.\"  And he withdrew his head, and went forth.  \"Ah!\nchieftain,\" said the maiden, \"if thou wilt do as I counsel thee, thou\nwilt shut the door, lest the man should have a plot against thee.\"\nUpon that Gwalchmai arose, and when he came near unto the door, the\nman, with sixty others, fully armed, were ascending the tower.  And\nGwalchmai defended the door with a chessboard, that none might enter\nuntil the man should return from the chase.  And thereupon, behold\nthe Earl arrived.  \"What is all this?\" asked he.  \"It is a sad\nthing,\" said the hoary-headed man; \"the young girl yonder has been\nsitting and eating with him who slew your father.  He is Gwalchmai,\nthe son of Gwyar.\"  \"Hold thy peace, then,\" said the Earl, \"I will go\nin.\"  And the Earl was joyful concerning Gwalchmai.  \"Ha! chieftain,\"\nsaid he, \"it was wrong of thee to come to my court, when thou knewest\nthat thou didst slay my father; and though we cannot avenge him,\nHeaven will avenge him upon thee.\"  \"My soul,\" said Gwalchmai, \"thus\nit is:  I came not here either to acknowledge or to deny having slain\nthy father; but I am on a message from Arthur, and therefore do I\ncrave the space of a year until I shall return from my embassy, and\nthen, upon my faith, I will come back unto this palace, and do one of\ntwo things, either acknowledge it, or deny it.\"  And the time was\ngranted him willingly; and he remained there that night.  And the\nnext morning he rode forth.  And the story relates nothing further of\nGwalchmai respecting this adventure.\n\nAnd Peredur rode forward.  And he wandered over the whole island,\nseeking tidings of the black maiden, and he could meet with none.\nAnd he came to an unknown land, in the centre of a valley, watered by\na river.  And as he traversed the valley he beheld a horseman coming\ntowards him, and wearing the garments of a priest; and he besought\nhis blessing.  \"Wretched man,\" said he, \"thou meritest no blessing,\nand thou wouldest not be profited by one, seeing that thou art clad\nin armour on such a day as this.\"  \"And what day is to-day?\" said\nPeredur.  \"To-day is Good Friday,\" he answered.  \"Chide me not that I\nknew not this, seeing that it is a year to-day since I journeyed\nforth from my country.\"  Then he dismounted, and led his horse in his\nhand.  And he had not proceeded far along the high road before he\ncame to a cross road, and the cross road traversed a wood.  And on\nthe other side of the wood he saw an unfortified castle, which\nappeared to be inhabited.  And at the gate of the castle there met\nhim the priest whom he had seen before, and he asked his blessing.\n\"The blessing of Heaven be unto thee,\" said he, \"it is more fitting\nto travel in thy present guise than as thou wast erewhile; and this\nnight thou shalt tarry with me.\"  So he remained there that night.\n\nAnd the next day Peredur sought to go forth.  \"To-day may no one\njourney.  Thou shalt remain with me to-day and to-morrow, and the day\nfollowing, and I will direct thee as best I may to the place which\nthou art seeking.\"  And the fourth day Peredur sought to go forth,\nand he entreated the priest to tell him how he should find the Castle\nof Wonders.  \"What I know thereof I will tell thee,\" he replied.  \"Go\nover yonder mountain, and on the other side of the mountain thou wilt\ncome to a river, and in the valley wherein the river runs is a King's\npalace, wherein the King sojourned during Easter.  And if thou mayest\nhave tidings anywhere of the Castle of Wonders, thou wilt have them\nthere.\"\n\nThen Peredur rode forward.  And he came to the valley in which was\nthe river, and there met him a number of men going to hunt, and in\nthe midst of them was a man of exalted rank, and Peredur saluted him.\n\"Choose, chieftain,\" said the man, \"whether thou wilt go with me to\nthe chase, or wilt proceed to my palace, and I will dispatch one of\nmy household to commend thee to my daughter, who is there, and who\nwill entertain thee with food and liquor until I return from hunting;\nand whatever may be thine errand, such as I can obtain for thee thou\nshalt gladly have.\"  And the King sent a little yellow page with him\nas an attendant; and when they came to the palace the lady had\narisen, and was about to wash before meat.  Peredur went forward, and\nshe saluted him joyfully, and placed him by her side.  And they took\ntheir repast.  And whatsoever Peredur said unto her, she laughed\nloudly, so that all in the palace could hear.  Then spoke the yellow\npage to the lady.  \"By my faith,\" said he, \"this youth is already thy\nhusband; or if he be not, thy mind and thy thoughts are set upon\nhim.\"  And the little yellow page went unto the King, and told him\nthat it seemed to him that the youth whom he had met with was his\ndaughter's husband, or if he were not so already that he would\nshortly become so unless he were cautious.  \"What is thy counsel in\nthis matter, youth?\" said the King.  \"My counsel is,\" he replied,\n\"that thou set strong men upon him, to seize him, until thou hast\nascertained the truth respecting this.\"  So he set strong men upon\nPeredur, who seized him and cast him into prison.  And the maiden\nwent before her father, and asked him wherefore he had caused the\nyouth from Arthur's Court to be imprisoned.  \"In truth,\" he answered,\n\"he shall not be free to-night, nor to-morrow, nor the day following,\nand he shall not come from where he is.\"  She replied not to what the\nKing had said, but she went to the youth.  \"Is it unpleasant to thee\nto be here?\" said she.  \"I should not care if I were not,\" he\nreplied.  \"Thy couch and thy treatment shall be in no wise inferior\nto that of the King himself, and thou shalt have the best\nentertainment that the palace affords.  And if it were more pleasing\nto thee that my couch should be here, that I might discourse with\nthee, it should be so, cheerfully.\"  \"This can I not refuse,\" said\nPeredur.  And he remained in prison that night.  And the maiden\nprovided all that she had promised him.\n\nAnd the next day Peredur heard a tumult in the town.  \"Tell me, fair\nmaiden, what is that tumult?\" said Peredur.  \"All the King's hosts\nand his forces have come to the town to-day.\"  \"And what seek they\nhere?\" he inquired.  \"There is an Earl near this place who possesses\ntwo Earldoms, and is as powerful as a King; and an engagement will\ntake place between them to-day.\"  \"I beseech thee,\" said Peredur, \"to\ncause a horse and arms to be brought, that I may view the encounter,\nand I promise to come back to my prison again.\"  \"Gladly,\" said she,\n\"will I provide thee with horse and arms.\"  So she gave him a horse\nand arms, and a bright scarlet robe of honour over his armour, and a\nyellow shield upon his shoulder.  And he went to the combat; and as\nmany of the Earl's men as encountered him that day he overthrew; and\nhe returned to his prison.  And the maiden asked tidings of Peredur,\nand he answered her not a word.  And she went and asked tidings of\nher father, and inquired who had acquitted himself best of the\nhousehold.  And he said that he knew not, but that it was a man with\na scarlet robe of honour over his armour, and a yellow shield upon\nhis shoulder.  Then she smiled, and returned to where Peredur was,\nand did him great honour that night.  And for three days did Peredur\nslay the Earl's men; and before any one could know who he was, he\nreturned to his prison.  And the fourth day Peredur slew the Earl\nhimself.  And the maiden went unto her father, and inquired of him\nthe news.  \"I have good news for thee,\" said the King; \"the Earl is\nslain, and I am the owner of his two Earldoms.\"  \"Knowest thou, lord,\nwho slew him?\"  \"I do not know,\" said the King.  \"It was the knight\nwith the scarlet robe of honour and the yellow shield.\"  \"Lord,\" said\nshe, \"I know who that is.\"  \"By Heaven!\" he exclaimed, \"who is he?\"\n\"Lord,\" she replied, \"he is the knight whom thou hast imprisoned.\"\nThen he went unto Peredur, and saluted him, and told him that he\nwould reward the service he had done him, in any way he might desire.\nAnd when they went to meat, Peredur was placed beside the King, and\nthe maiden on the other side of Peredur.  \"I will give thee,\" said\nthe King, \"my daughter in marriage, and half my kingdom with her, and\nthe two Earldoms as a gift.\"  \"Heaven reward thee, lord,\" said\nPeredur, \"but I came not here to woo.\"  \"What seekest thou then,\nchieftain?\"  \"I am seeking tidings of the Castle of Wonders.\"  \"Thy\nenterprise is greater, chieftain, than thou wilt wish to pursue,\"\nsaid the maiden, \"nevertheless, tidings shalt thou have of the\nCastle, and thou shalt have a guide through my father's dominions,\nand a sufficiency of provisions for thy journey, for thou art, O\nchieftain, the man whom best I love.\"  Then she said to him, \"Go over\nyonder mountain, and thou wilt find a lake, and in the middle of the\nlake there is a Castle, and that is the Castle that is called the\nCastle of Wonders; and we know not what wonders are therein, but thus\nis it called.\"\n\nAnd Peredur proceeded towards the Castle, and the gate of the Castle\nwas open.  And when he came to the hall, the door was open, and he\nentered.  And he beheld a chessboard in the hall, and the chessmen\nwere playing against each other, by themselves.  And the side that he\nfavoured lost the game, and thereupon the others set up a shout, as\nthough they had been living men.  And Peredur was wroth, and took the\nchessmen in his lap, and cast the chessboard into the lake.  And when\nhe had done thus, behold the black maiden came in, and she said to\nhim, \"The welcome of Heaven be not unto thee.  Thou hadst rather do\nevil than good.\"  \"What complaint hast thou against me, maiden?\" said\nPeredur.  \"That thou hast occasioned unto the Empress the loss of her\nchessboard, which she would not have lost for all her empire.  And\nthe way in which thou mayest recover the chessboard is, to repair to\nthe Castle of Ysbidinongyl, where is a black man, who lays waste the\ndominions of the Empress; and if thou canst slay him, thou wilt\nrecover the chessboard.  But if thou goest there, thou wilt not\nreturn alive.\"  \"Wilt thou direct me thither?\" said Peredur.  \"I will\nshow thee the way,\" she replied.  So he went to the Castle of\nYsbidinongyl, and he fought with the black man.  And the black man\nbesought mercy of Peredur.  \"Mercy will I grant thee,\" said he, \"on\ncondition that thou cause the chessboard to be restored to the place\nwhere it was when I entered the hall.\"  Then the maiden came to him,\nand said, \"The malediction of Heaven attend thee for thy work, since\nthou hast left that monster alive, who lays waste all the possessions\nof the Empress.\"  \"I granted him his life,\" said Peredur, \"that he\nmight cause the chessboard to be restored.\"  \"The chessboard is not\nin the place where thou didst find it; go back, therefore, and slay\nhim,\" answered she.  So Peredur went back, and slew the black man.\nAnd when he returned to the palace, he found the black maiden there.\n\"Ah! maiden,\" said Peredur, \"where is the Empress?\"  \"I declare to\nHeaven that thou wilt not see her now, unless thou dost slay the\nmonster that is in yonder forest.\"  \"What monster is there?\"  \"It is\na stag that is as swift as the swiftest bird; and he has one horn in\nhis forehead, as long as the shaft of a spear, and as sharp as\nwhatever is sharpest.  And he destroys the branches of the best trees\nin the forest, and he kills every animal that he meets with therein;\nand those that he doth not slay perish of hunger.  And what is worse\nthan that, he comes every night, and drinks up the fish-pond, and\nleaves the fishes exposed, so that for the most part they die before\nthe water returns again.\"  \"Maiden,\" said Peredur, \"wilt thou come\nand show me this animal?\"  \"Not so,\" said the maiden, \"for he has not\npermitted any mortal to enter the forest for above a twelvemonth.\nBehold, here is a little dog belonging to the Empress, which will\nrouse the stag, and will chase him towards thee, and the stag will\nattack thee.\"  Then the little dog went as a guide to Peredur, and\nroused the stag, and brought him towards the place where Peredur was.\nAnd the stag attacked Peredur, and he let him pass by him, and as he\ndid so, he smote off his head with his sword.  And while he was\nlooking at the head of the stag, he saw a lady on horseback coming\ntowards him.  And she took the little dog in the lappet of her cap,\nand the head and the body of the stag lay before her.  And around the\nstag's neck was a golden collar.  \"Ha! chieftain,\" said she,\n\"uncourteously hast thou acted in slaying the fairest jewel that was\nin my dominions.\"  \"I was entreated so to do; and is there any way by\nwhich I can obtain thy friendship?\"  \"There is,\" she replied.  \"Go\nthou forward unto yonder mountain, and there thou wilt find a grove;\nand in the grove there is a cromlech; do thou there challenge a man\nthree times to fight, and thou shalt have my friendship.\"\n\nSo Peredur proceeded onward, and came to the side of the grove, and\nchallenged any man to fight.  And a black man arose from beneath the\ncromlech, mounted upon a bony horse, and both he and his horse were\nclad in huge rusty armour.  And they fought.  And as often as Peredur\ncast the black man to the earth, he would jump again into his saddle.\nAnd Peredur dismounted, and drew his sword; and thereupon the black\nman disappeared with Peredur's horse and his own, so that he could\nnot gain sight of him a second time.  And Peredur went along the\nmountain, and on the other side of the mountain he beheld a castle in\nthe valley, wherein was a river.  And he went to the castle; and as\nhe entered it, he saw a hall, and the door of the hall was open, and\nhe went in.  And there he saw a lame grey-headed man sitting on one\nside of the hall, with Gwalchmai beside him.  And Peredur beheld his\nhorse, which the black man had taken, in the same stall with that of\nGwalchmai.  And they were glad concerning Peredur.  And he went and\nseated himself on the other side of the hoary-headed man.  Then,\nbehold a yellow-haired youth came, and bent upon the knee before\nPeredur, and besought his friendship.  \"Lord,\" said the youth, \"it\nwas I that came in the form of the black maiden to Arthur's Court,\nand when thou didst throw down the chessboard, and when thou didst\nslay the black man of Ysbidinongyl, and when thou didst slay the\nstag, and when thou didst go to fight the black man of the cromlech.\nAnd I came with the bloody head in the salver, and with the lance\nthat streamed with blood from the point to the hand, all along the\nshaft; and the head was thy cousin's, and he was killed by the\nsorceresses of Gloucester, who also lamed thine uncle; and I am thy\ncousin.  And there is a prediction that thou art to avenge these\nthings.\"  Then Peredur and Gwalchmai took counsel, and sent to Arthur\nand his household, to beseech them to come against the sorceresses.\nAnd they began to fight with them; and one of the sorceresses slew\none of Arthur's men before Peredur's face, and Peredur bade her\nforbear.  And the sorceress slew a man before Peredur's face a second\ntime, and a second time he forbad her.  And the third time the\nsorceress slew a man before the face of Peredur; and then Peredur\ndrew his sword, and smote the sorceress on the helmet; and all her\nhead-armour was split in two parts.  And she set up a cry, and\ndesired the other sorceresses to flee, and told them that this was\nPeredur, the man who had learnt Chivalry with them, and by whom they\nwere destined to be slain.  Then Arthur and his household fell upon\nthe sorceresses, and slew the sorceresses of Gloucester every one.\nAnd thus is it related concerning the Castle of Wonders.\n\n\n\nGERAINT THE SON OF ERBIN\n\n\n\nArthur was accustomed to hold his Court at Caerlleon upon Usk.  And\nthere he held it seven Easters and five Christmases.  And once upon a\ntime he held his Court there at Whitsuntide.  For Caerlleon was the\nplace most easy of access in his dominions, both by sea and by land.\nAnd there were assembled nine crowned kings, who were his\ntributaries, and likewise earls and barons.  For they were his\ninvited guests at all the high festivals, unless they were prevented\nby any great hindrance.  And when he was at Caerlleon, holding his\nCourt, thirteen churches were set apart for mass.  And thus were they\nappointed:  one church for Arthur, and his kings, and his guests; and\nthe second for Gwenhwyvar and her ladies; and the third for the\nSteward of the Household and the suitors; and the fourth for the\nFranks and the other officers; and the other nine churches were for\nthe nine Masters of the Household and chiefly for Cwalchmai; for he,\nfrom the eminence of his warlike fame, and from the nobleness of his\nbirth, was the most exalted of the nine.  And there was no other\narrangement respecting the churches than that which we have mentioned\nabove.\n\nGlewlwyd Gavaelvawr was the chief porter; but he did not himself\nperform the office, except at one of the three high festivals, for he\nhad seven men to serve him, and they divided the year amongst them.\nThey were Grynn, and Pen Pighon, and Llaes Cymyn, and Gogyfwlch, and\nGwrdnei with cat's eyes, who could see as well by night as by day,\nand Drem the son of Dremhitid, and Clust the son of Clustveinyd; and\nthese were Arthur's guards.  And on Whit-Tuesday, as the King sat at\nthe banquet, lo! there entered a tall, fair-headed youth, clad in a\ncoat and a surcoat of diapered satin, and a golden-hilted sword about\nhis neck, and low shoes of leather upon his feet.  And he came, and\nstood before Arthur.  \"Hail to thee, Lord!\" said he.  \"Heaven prosper\nthee,\" he answered, \"and be thou welcome.  Dost thou bring any new\ntidings?\"  \"I do, Lord,\" he said.  \"I know thee not,\" said Arthur.\n\"It is a marvel to me that thou dost not know me.  I am one of thy\nforesters, Lord, in the Forest of Dean, and my name is Madawc, the\nson of Twrgadarn.\"  \"Tell me thine errand,\" said Arthur.  \"I will do\nso, Lord,\" said he.  \"In the Forest I saw a stag, the like of which\nbeheld I never yet.\"  \"What is there about him,\" asked Arthur, \"that\nthou never yet didst see his like?\"  \"He is of pure white, Lord, and\nhe does not herd with any other animal through stateliness and pride,\nso royal is his bearing.  And I come to seek thy counsel, Lord, and\nto know thy will concerning him.\"  \"It seems best to me,\" said\nArthur, \"to go and hunt him to-morrow at break of day; and to cause\ngeneral notice thereof to be given to-night in all quarters of the\nCourt.\"  And Arryfuerys was Arthur's chief huntsman, and Arelivri was\nhis chief page.  And all received notice; and thus it was arranged.\nAnd they sent the youth before them.  Then Gwenhwyvar said to Arthur,\n\"Wilt thou permit me, Lord,\" said she, \"to go to-morrow to see and\nhear the hunt of the stag of which the young man spoke?\"  \"I will\ngladly,\" said Arthur.  \"Then will I go,\" said she.  And Gwalchmai\nsaid to Arthur, \"Lord, if it seem well to thee, permit that into\nwhose hunt soever the stag shall come, that one, be he a knight, or\none on foot, may cut off his head, and give it to whom he pleases,\nwhether to his own lady-love, or to the lady of his friend.\"  \"I\ngrant it gladly,\" said Arthur, \"and let the Steward of the Household\nbe chastised, if all are not ready to-morrow for the chase.\"\n\nAnd they passed the night with songs, and diversions, and discourse,\nand ample entertainment.  And when it was time for them all to go to\nsleep, they went.  And when the next day came, they arose; and Arthur\ncalled the attendants, who guarded his couch.  And these were four\npages, whose names were Cadyrnerth the son of Porthawr Gandwy, and\nAmbreu the son of Bedwor, and Amhar the son of Arthur, and Goreu the\nson of Custennin.  And these men came to Arthur and saluted him, and\narrayed him in his garments.  And Arthur wondered that Gwenhwyvar did\nnot awake, and did not move in her bed; and the attendants wished to\nawaken her.  \"Disturb her not,\" said Arthur, \"for she had rather\nsleep than go to see the hunting.\"\n\nThen Arthur went forth, and he heard two horns sounding, one from\nnear the lodging of the chief huntsman, and the other from near that\nof the chief page.  And the whole assembly of the multitudes came to\nArthur, and they took the road to the Forest.\n\nAnd after Arthur had gone forth from the palace, Gwenhwyvar awoke,\nand called to her maidens, and apparelled herself.  \"Maidens,\" said\nshe, \"I had leave last night to go and see the hunt.  Go one of you\nto the stable, and order hither a horse such as a woman may ride.\"\nAnd one of them went, and she found but two horses in the stable, and\nGwenhwyvar and one of her maidens mounted them, and went through the\nUsk, and followed the track of the men and the horses.  And as they\nrode thus, they heard a loud and rushing sound; and they looked\nbehind them, and beheld a knight upon a hunter foal of mighty size;\nand the rider was a fair-haired youth, bare-legged, and of princely\nmien, and a golden-hilted sword was at his side, and a robe and a\nsurcoat of satin were upon him, and two low shoes of leather upon his\nfeet; and around him was a scarf of blue purple, at each corner of\nwhich was a golden apple.  And his horse stepped stately, and swift,\nand proud; and he overtook Gwenhwyvar, and saluted her.  \"Heaven\nprosper thee, Geraint,\" said she, \"I knew thee when first I saw thee\njust now.  And the welcome of Heaven be unto thee.  And why didst\nthou not go with thy lord to hunt?\"  \"Because I knew not when he\nwent,\" said he.  \"I marvel, too,\" said she, \"how he could go unknown\nto me.\"  \"Indeed, lady,\" said he.  \"I was asleep, and knew not when\nhe went; but thou, O young man, art the most agreeable companion I\ncould have in the whole kingdom; and it may be, that I shall be more\namused with the hunting than they; for we shall hear the horns when\nthey sound, and we shall hear the dogs when they are let loose, and\nbegin to cry.\"  So they went to the edge of the Forest, and there\nthey stood.  \"From this place,\" said she, \"we shall hear when the\ndogs are let loose.\"  And thereupon, they heard a loud noise, and\nthey looked towards the spot whence it came, and they beheld a dwarf\nriding upon a horse, stately, and foaming, and prancing, and strong,\nand spirited.  And in the hand of the dwarf was a whip.  And near the\ndwarf they saw a lady upon a beautiful white horse, of steady and\nstately pace; and she was clothed in a garment of gold brocade.  And\nnear her was a knight upon a warhorse of large size, with heavy and\nbright armour both upon himself and upon his horse.  And truly they\nnever before saw a knight, or a horse, or armour, of such remarkable\nsize.  And they were all near to each other.\n\n\"Geraint,\" said Gwenhwyvar, \"knowest thou the name of that tall\nknight yonder?\"  \"I know him not,\" said he, \"and the strange armour\nthat he wears prevents my either seeing his face or his features.\"\n\"Go, maiden,\" said Gwenhwyvar, \"and ask the dwarf who that knight\nis.\"  Then the maiden went up to the dwarf; and the dwarf waited for\nthe maiden, when he saw her coming towards him.  And the maiden\ninquired of the dwarf who the knight was.  \"I will not tell thee,\" he\nanswered.  \"Since thou art so churlish as not to tell me,\" said she,\n\"I will ask him himself.\"  \"Thou shalt not ask him, by my faith,\"\nsaid he.  \"Wherefore?\" said she.  \"Because thou art not of honour\nsufficient to befit thee to speak to my Lord.\"  Then the maiden\nturned her horse's head towards the knight, upon which the dwarf\nstruck her with the whip that was in his hand across the face and the\neyes, until the blood flowed forth.  And the maiden, through the hurt\nshe received from the blow, returned to Gwenhwyvar, complaining of\nthe pain.  \"Very rudely has the dwarf treated thee,\" said Geraint.\n\"I will go myself to know who the knight is.\"  \"Go,\" said Gwenhwyvar.\nAnd Geraint went up to the dwarf.  \"Who is yonder knight?\" said\nGeraint.  \"I will not tell thee,\" said the dwarf.  \"Then will I ask\nhim himself,\" said he.  \"That wilt thou not, by my faith,\" said the\ndwarf, \"thou art not honourable enough to speak with my Lord.\"  Said\nGeraint, \"I have spoken with men of equal rank with him.\"  And he\nturned his horse's head towards the knight; but the dwarf overtook\nhim, and struck him as he had done the maiden, so that the blood\ncoloured the scarf that Geraint wore.  Then Geraint put his hand upon\nthe hilt of his sword, but he took counsel with himself, and\nconsidered that it would be no vengeance for him to slay the dwarf,\nand to be attacked unarmed by the armed knight, so he returned to\nwhere Gwenhwyvar was.\n\n\"Thou hast acted wisely and discreetly,\" said she.  \"Lady,\" said he,\n\"I will follow him yet, with thy permission; and at last he will come\nto some inhabited place, where I may have arms either as a loan or\nfor a pledge, so that I may encounter the knight.\"  \"Go,\" said she,\n\"and do not attack him until thou hast good arms, and I shall be very\nanxious concerning thee, until I hear tidings of thee.\"  \"If I am\nalive,\" said he, \"thou shalt hear tidings of me by to-morrow\nafternoon;\" and with that he departed.\n\nAnd the road they took was below the palace of Caerlleon, and across\nthe ford of the Usk; and they went along a fair, and even, and lofty\nridge of ground, until they came to a town, and at the extremity of\nthe town they saw a Fortress and a Castle.  And they came to the\nextremity of the town.  And as the knight passed through it, all the\npeople arose, and saluted him, and bade him welcome.  And when\nGeraint came into the town, he looked at every house, to see if he\nknew any of those whom he saw.  But he knew none, and none knew him\nto do him the kindness to let him have arms either as a loan or for a\npledge.  And every house he saw was full of men, and arms, and\nhorses.  And they were polishing shields, and burnishing swords, and\nwashing armour, and shoeing horses.  And the knight, and the lady,\nand the dwarf rode up to the Castle that was in the town, and every\none was glad in the Castle.  And from the battlements and the gates\nthey risked their necks, through their eagerness to greet them, and\nto show their joy.\n\nGeraint stood there to see whether the knight would remain in the\nCastle; and when he was certain that he would do so, he looked around\nhim; and at a little distance from the town he saw an old palace in\nruins, wherein was a hall that was falling to decay.  And as he knew\nnot any one in the town, he went towards the old palace; and when he\ncame near to the palace, he saw but one chamber, and a bridge of\nmarble-stone leading to it.  And upon the bridge he saw sitting a\nhoary-headed man, upon whom were tattered garments.  And Geraint\ngazed steadfastly upon him for a long time.  Then the hoary-headed\nman spoke to him.  \"Young man,\" he said, \"wherefore art thou\nthoughtful?\"  \"I am thoughtful,\" said he, \"because I know not where\nto go to-night.\"  \"Wilt thou come forward this way, chieftain?\" said\nhe, \"and thou shalt have of the best that can be procured for thee.\"\nSo Geraint went forward.  And the hoary-headed man preceded him into\nthe hall.  And in the hall he dismounted, and he left there his\nhorse.  Then he went on to the upper chamber with the hoary-headed\nman.  And in the chamber he beheld an old decrepit woman, sitting on\na cushion, with old, tattered garments of satin upon her; and it\nseemed to him that he had never seen a woman fairer than she must\nhave been, when in the fulness of youth.  And beside her was a\nmaiden, upon whom were a vest and a veil, that were old, and\nbeginning to be worn out.  And truly, he never saw a maiden more full\nof comeliness, and grace, and beauty than she.  And the hoary-headed\nman said to the maiden, \"There is no attendant for the horse of this\nyouth but thyself.\"  \"I will render the best service I am able,\" said\nshe, \"both to him and to his horse.\"  And the maiden disarrayed the\nyouth, and then she furnished his horse with straw and with corn.\nAnd she went to the hall as before, and then she returned to the\nchamber.  And the hoary-headed man said to the maiden, \"Go to the\ntown,\" said he, \"and bring hither the best that thou canst find both\nof food and of liquor.\"  \"I will, gladly, Lord,\" said she.  And to\nthe town went the maiden.  And they conversed together while the\nmaiden was at the town.  And, behold! the maiden came back, and a\nyouth with her, bearing on his back a costrel full of good purchased\nmead, and a quarter of a young bullock.  And in the hands of the\nmaiden was a quantity of white bread, and she had some manchet bread\nin her veil, and she came into the chamber.  \"I could not obtain\nbetter than this,\" said she, \"nor with better should I have been\ntrusted.\"  \"It is good enough,\" said Geraint.  And they caused the\nmeat to be boiled; and when their food was ready, they sat down.  And\nit was on this wise; Geraint sat between the hoary-headed man and his\nwife, and the maiden served them.  And they ate and drank.\n\nAnd when they had finished eating, Geraint talked with the hoary-\nheaded man, and he asked him in the first place, to whom belonged the\npalace that he was in.  \"Truly,\" said he, \"it was I that built it,\nand to me also belonged the city and the castle which thou sawest.\"\n\"Alas!\" said Geraint, \"how is it that thou hast lost them now?\"  \"I\nlost a great Earldom as well as these,\" said he; \"and this is how I\nlost them.  I had a nephew, the son of my brother, and I took his\npossessions to myself; and when he came to his strength, he demanded\nof me his property, but I withheld it from him.  So he made war upon\nme, and wrested from me all that I possessed.\"  \"Good Sir,\" said\nGeraint, \"wilt thou tell me wherefore came the knight, and the lady,\nand the dwarf, just now into the town, and what is the preparation\nwhich I saw, and the putting of arms in order?\"  \"I will do so,\" said\nhe.  \"The preparations are for the game that is to be held to-morrow\nby the young Earl, which will be on this wise.  In the midst of a\nmeadow which is here, two forks will be set up, and upon the two\nforks a silver rod, and upon the silver rod a Sparrow-Hawk, and for\nthe Sparrow-Hawk there will be a tournament.  And to the tournament\nwill go all the array thou didst see in the city, of men, and of\nhorses, and of arms.  And with each man will go the lady he loves\nbest; and no man can joust for the Sparrow-Hawk, except the lady he\nloves best be with him.  And the knight that thou sawest has gained\nthe Sparrow-Hawk these two years; and if he gains it the third year,\nthey will, from that time, send it every year to him, and he himself\nwill come here no more.  And he will be called the Knight of the\nSparrow-Hawk from that time forth.\"  \"Sir,\" said Geraint, \"what is\nthy counsel to me concerning this knight, on account of the insult\nwhich I received from the dwarf, and that which was received by the\nmaiden of Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur?\"  And Geraint told the\nhoary-headed man what the insult was that he had received.  \"It is\nnot easy to counsel thee, inasmuch as thou hast neither dame nor\nmaiden belonging to thee, for whom thou canst joust.  Yet, I have\narms here, which thou couldest have; and there is my horse also, if\nhe seem to thee better than thine own.\"  \"Ah!  Sir,\" said he, \"Heaven\nreward thee.  But my own horse, to which I am accustomed, together\nwith thy arms, will suffice me.  And if, when the appointed time\nshall come to-morrow, thou wilt permit me, Sir, to challenge for\nyonder maiden that is thy daughter, I will engage, if I escape from\nthe tournament, to love the maiden as long as I live; and if I do not\nescape, she will remain unsullied as before.\"  \"Gladly will I permit\nthee,\" said the hoary-headed man, \"and since thou dost thus resolve,\nit is necessary that thy horse and arms should be ready to-morrow at\nbreak of day.  For then the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk will make\nproclamation, and ask the lady he loves best to take the Sparrow-\nHawk.  'For,' will he say to her, 'thou art the fairest of women, and\nthou didst possess it last year, and the year previous; and if any\ndeny it thee to-day, by force will I defend it for thee.'  And\ntherefore,\" said the hoary-headed man, \"it is needful for thee to be\nthere at daybreak; and we three will be with thee.\"  And thus was it\nsettled.\n\nAnd at night, lo! they went to sleep; and before the dawn they arose,\nand arrayed themselves; and by the time that it was day, they were\nall four in the meadow.  And there was the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk\nmaking the proclamation, and asking his lady-love to fetch the\nSparrow-Hawk.  \"Fetch it not,\" said Geraint, \"for there is here a\nmaiden, who is fairer, and more noble, and more comely, and who has a\nbetter claim to it than thou.\"  \"If thou maintainest the Sparrow-Hawk\nto be due to her, come forward, and do battle with me.\"  And Geraint\nwent forward to the top of the meadow, having upon himself and upon\nhis horse armour which was heavy, and rusty, and worthless, and of\nuncouth shape.  Then they encountered each other, and they broke a\nset of lances, and they broke a second set, and a third.  And thus\nthey did at every onset, and they broke as many lances as were\nbrought to them.  And when the Earl and his company saw the Knight of\nthe Sparrow-Hawk gaining the mastery, there was shouting, and joy,\nand mirth amongst them.  And the hoary-headed man, and his wife, and\nhis daughter were sorrowful.  And the hoary-headed man served Geraint\nlances as often as he broke them, and the dwarf served the Knight of\nthe Sparrow-Hawk.  Then the hoary-headed man came to Geraint.  \"Oh!\nchieftain,\" said he, \"since no other will hold with thee, behold,\nhere is the lance which was in my hand on the day when I received the\nhonour of knighthood; and from that time to this I never broke it.\nAnd it has an excellent point.\"  Then Geraint took the lance,\nthanking the hoary-headed man.  And thereupon the dwarf also brought\na lance to his lord.  \"Behold, here is a lance for thee, not less\ngood than his,\" said the dwarf.  \"And bethink thee, that no knight\never withstood thee before so long as this one has done.\"  \"I declare\nto Heaven,\" said Geraint, \"that unless death takes me quickly hence,\nhe shall fare never the better for thy service.\"  And Geraint pricked\nhis horse towards him from afar, and warning him, he rushed upon him,\nand gave him a blow so severe, and furious, and fierce, upon the face\nof his shield, that he cleft it in two, and broke his armour, and\nburst his girths, so that both he and his saddle were borne to the\nground over the horse's crupper.  And Geraint dismounted quickly.\nAnd he was wroth, and he drew his sword, and rushed fiercely upon\nhim.  Then the knight also arose, and drew his sword against Geraint.\nAnd they fought on foot with their swords until their arms struck\nsparks of fire like stars from one another; and thus they continued\nfighting until the blood and sweat obscured the light from their\neyes.  And when Geraint prevailed, the hoary-headed man, and his\nwife, and his daughter were glad; and when the knight prevailed, it\nrejoiced the Earl and his party.  Then the hoary-headed man saw\nGeraint receive a severe stroke, and he went up to him quickly, and\nsaid to him, \"Oh, chieftain, remember the treatment which thou hadst\nfrom the dwarf; and wilt thou not seek vengeance for the insult to\nthyself, and for the insult to Gwenhwyvar the wife of Arthur!\"  And\nGeraint was roused by what he said to him, and he called to him all\nhis strength, and lifted up his sword, and struck the knight upon the\ncrown of his head, so that he broke all his head-armour, and cut\nthrough all the flesh and the skin, even to the skull, until he\nwounded the bone.\n\nThen the knight fell upon his knees, and cast his sword from his\nhand, and besought mercy of Geraint.  \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"I\nrelinquish my overdaring and my pride in craving thy mercy; and\nunless I have time to commit myself to Heaven for my sins, and to\ntalk with a priest, thy mercy will avail me little.\"  \"I will grant\nthee grace upon this condition,\" said Geraint, \"that thou wilt go to\nGwenhwyvar the wife of Arthur, to do her satisfaction for the insult\nwhich her maiden received from thy dwarf.  As to myself, for the\ninsult which I received from thee and thy dwarf, I am content with\nthat which I have done unto thee.  Dismount not from the time thou\ngoest hence until thou comest into the presence of Gwenhwyvar, to\nmake her what atonement shall be adjudged at the Court of Arthur.\"\n\"This will I do gladly.  And who art thou?\" said he.  \"I am Geraint\nthe son of Erbin.  And declare thou also who thou art.\"  \"I am Edeyrn\nthe son of Nudd.\"  Then he threw himself upon his horse, and went\nforward to Arthur's Court, and the lady he loved best went before him\nand the dwarf, with much lamentation.  And thus far this story up to\nthat time.\n\n\nThen came the little Earl and his hosts to Geraint, and saluted him,\nand bade him to his castle.  \"I may not go,\" said Geraint, \"but where\nI was last night, there will I be to-night also.\"  \"Since thou wilt\nnone of my inviting, thou shalt have abundance of all that I can\ncommand for thee, in the place thou wast last night.  And I will\norder ointment for thee, to recover thee from thy fatigues, and from\nthe weariness that is upon thee.\"  \"Heaven reward thee,\" said\nGeraint, \"and I will go to my lodging.\"  And thus went Geraint, and\nEarl Ynywl, and his wife, and his daughter.  And when they reached\nthe chamber, the household servants and attendants of the young Earl\nhad arrived at the Court, and they arranged all the houses, dressing\nthem with straw and with fire; and in a short time the ointment was\nready, and Geraint came there, and they washed his head.  Then came\nthe young Earl, with forty honourable knights from among his\nattendants, and those who were bidden to the tournament.  And Geraint\ncame from the anointing.  And the Earl asked him to go to the hall to\neat.  \"Where is the Earl Ynywl,\" said Geraint, \"and his wife, and his\ndaughter?\"  \"They are in the chamber yonder,\" said the Earl's\nchamberlain, \"arraying themselves in garments which the Earl has\ncaused to be brought for them.\"  \"Let not the damsel array herself,\"\nsaid he, \"except in her vest and her veil, until she come to the\nCourt of Arthur, to be clad by Gwenhwyvar in such garments as she may\nchoose.\"  So the maiden did not array herself.\n\nThen they all entered the hall, and they washed, and went, and sat\ndown to meat.  And thus were they seated.  On one side of Geraint sat\nthe young Earl, and Earl Ynywl beyond him; and on the other side of\nGeraint were the maiden and her mother.  And after these all sat\naccording to their precedence in honour.  And they ate.  And they\nwere served abundantly, and they received a profusion of divers kind\nof gifts.  Then they conversed together.  And the young Earl invited\nGeraint to visit him next day.  \"I will not, by Heaven,\" said\nGeraint.  \"To the Court of Arthur will I go with this maiden to-\nmorrow.  And it is enough for me, as long as Earl Ynywl is in poverty\nand trouble; and I go chiefly to seek to add to his maintenance.\"\n\"Ah, chieftain,\" said the young Earl, \"it is not by my fault that\nEarl Ynywl is without his possessions.\"  \"By my faith,\" said Geraint,\n\"he shall not remain without them, unless death quickly takes me\nhence.\"  \"Oh, chieftain,\" said he, \"with regard to the disagreement\nbetween me and Ynywl, I will gladly abide by thy counsel, and agree\nto what thou mayest judge right between us.\"  \"I but ask thee,\" said\nGeraint, \"to restore to him what is his, and what he should have\nreceived from the time he lost his possessions, even until this day.\"\n\"That I will do gladly, for thee,\" answered he.  \"Then,\" said\nGeraint, \"whosoever is here who owes homage to Ynywl, let him come\nforward, and perform it on the spot.\"  And all the men did so.  And\nby that treaty they abided.  And his castle, and his town, and all\nhis possessions were restored to Ynywl.  And he received back all\nthat he had lost, even to the smallest jewel.\n\nThen spoke Earl Ynywl to Geraint.  \"Chieftain,\" said he, \"behold the\nmaiden for whom thou didst challenge at the tournament, I bestow her\nupon thee.\"  \"She shall go with me,\" said Geraint, \"to the Court of\nArthur; and Arthur and Gwenhwyvar they shall dispose of her as they\nwill.\"  And the next day they proceeded to Arthur's Court.  So far\nconcerning Geraint.\n\n\nNow, this is how Arthur hunted the stag.  The men and the dogs were\ndivided into hunting parties, and the dogs were let loose upon the\nstag.  And the last dog that was let loose was the favourite dog of\nArthur.  Cavall was his name.  And he left all the other dogs behind\nhim, and turned the stag.  And at the second turn, the stag came\ntowards the hunting party of Arthur.  And Arthur set upon him.  And\nbefore he could be slain by any other, Arthur cut off his head.  Then\nthey sounded the death horn for slaying, and they all gathered round.\n\nThen came Kadyrieith to Arthur, and spoke to him.  \"Lord,\" said he,\n\"behold, yonder is Gwenhwyvar, and none with her save only one\nmaiden.\"  \"Command Gildas the son of Caw, and all the scholars of the\nCourt,\" said Arthur, \"to attend Gwenhwyvar to the palace.\"  And they\ndid so.\n\nThen they all set forth, holding converse together concerning the\nhead of the stag, to whom it should be given.  One wished that it\nshould be given to the lady best beloved by him, and another to the\nlady whom he loved best.  And all they of the household, and the\nknights, disputed sharply concerning the head.  And with that they\ncame to the palace.  And when Arthur and Gwenhwyvar heard them\ndisputing about the head of the stag, Gwenhwyvar said to Arthur, \"My\nlord, this is my counsel concerning the stag's head; let it not be\ngiven away until Geraint the son of Erbin shall return from the\nerrand he is upon.\"  And Gwenhwyvar told Arthur what that errand was.\n\"Right gladly shall it be so,\" said Arthur.  And thus it was settled.\nAnd the next day Gwenhwyvar caused a watch to be set upon the\nramparts for Geraint's coming.  And after mid-day they beheld an\nunshapely little man upon a horse, and after him, as they supposed, a\ndame or a damsel, also on horseback, and after her a knight of large\nstature, bowed down, and hanging his head low and sorrowfully, and\nclad in broken and worthless armour.\n\nAnd before they came near to the gate, one of the watch went to\nGwenhwyvar, and told her what kind of people they saw, and what\naspect they bore.  \"I know not who they are,\" said he.  \"But I know,\"\nsaid Gwenhwyvar; \"this is the knight whom Geraint pursued, and\nmethinks that he comes not here by his own free will.  But Geraint\nhas overtaken him, and avenged the insult to the maiden to the\nuttermost.\"  And thereupon, behold a porter came to the spot where\nGwenhwyvar was.  \"Lady,\" said he, \"at the gate there is a knight, and\nI saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he.\nMiserable and broken is the armour that he wears, and the hue of\nblood is more conspicuous upon it than its own colour.\"  \"Knowest\nthou his name?\" said she.  \"I do,\" said he; \"he tells me that he is\nEdeyrn the son of Nudd.\"  Then she replied, \"I know him not.\"\n\nSo Gwenhwyvar went to the gate to meet him, and he entered.  And\nGwenhwyvar was sorry when she saw the condition he was in, even\nthough he was accompanied by the churlish dwarf.  Then Edeyrn saluted\nGwenhwyvar.  \"Heaven protect thee,\" said she.  \"Lady,\" said he,\n\"Geraint the son of Erbin, thy best and most valiant servant, greets\nthee.\"  \"Did he meet thee?\" she asked.  \"Yes,\" said he, \"and it was\nnot to my advantage; and that was not his fault, but mine, Lady.  And\nGeraint greets thee well; and in greeting thee he compelled me to\ncome hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden\nreceived from the dwarf.  He forgives the insult to himself, in\nconsideration of his having put me in peril of my life.  And he\nimposed on me a condition, manly, and honourable, and warrior-like,\nwhich was to do thee justice, Lady.\"  \"Now, where did he overtake\nthee?\"  \"At the place where we were jousting, and contending for the\nSparrow-Hawk, in the town which is now called Cardiff.  And there\nwere none with him save three persons, of a mean and tattered\ncondition.  And these were an aged, hoary-headed man, and a woman\nadvanced in years, and a fair young maiden, clad in worn-out\ngarments.  And it was for the avouchment of the love of that maiden\nthat Geraint jousted for the Sparrow-Hawk at the tournament, for he\nsaid that that maiden was better entitled to the Sparrow-Hawk than\nthis maiden who was with me.  And thereupon we encountered each\nother, and he left me, Lady, as thou seest.\"  \"Sir,\" said she, \"when\nthinkest thou that Geraint will be here?\"  \"To-morrow, Lady, I think\nhe will be here with the maiden.\"\n\nThen Arthur came to him, and he saluted Arthur; and Arthur gazed a\nlong time upon him, and was amazed to see him thus.  And thinking\nthat he knew him, he inquired of him, \"Art thou Edeyrn the son of\nNudd?\"  \"I am, Lord,\" said he, \"and I have met with much trouble, and\nreceived wounds unsupportable.\"  Then he told Arthur all his\nadventure.  \"Well,\" said Arthur, \"from what I hear, it behoves\nGwenhwyvar to be merciful towards thee.\"  \"The mercy which thou\ndesirest, Lord,\" said she, \"will I grant to him, since it is as\ninsulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to\nthyself.\"  \"Thus will it be best to do,\" said Arthur; \"let this man\nhave medical care until it be known whether he may live.  And if he\nlive, he shall do such satisfaction as shall be judged best by the\nmen of the Court; and take thou sureties to that effect.  And if he\ndie, too much will be the death of such a youth as Edeyrn for an\ninsult to a maiden.\"  \"This pleases me,\" said Gwenhwyvar.  And Arthur\nbecame surety for Edeyrn, and Caradawc the son of Llyr, Gwallawg the\nson of Llenawg, and Owain the son of Nudd, and Gwalchmai, and many\nothers with them.  And Arthur caused Morgan Tud to be called to him.\nHe was the chief physician.  \"Take with thee Edeyrn the son of Nudd,\nand cause a chamber to be prepared for him, and let him have the aid\nof medicine as thou wouldst do unto myself, if I were wounded, and\nlet none into his chamber to molest him, but thyself and thy\ndisciples, to administer to him remedies.\"  \"I will do so gladly,\nLord,\" said Morgan Tud.  Then said the steward of the household,\n\"Whither is it right, Lord, to order the maiden?\"  \"To Gwenhwyvar and\nher handmaidens,\" said he.  And the steward of the household so\nordered her.  Thus far concerning them.\n\n\nThe next day came Geraint towards the Court; and there was a watch\nset on the ramparts by Gwenhwyvar, lest he should arrive unawares.\nAnd one of the watch came to the place where Gwenhwyvar was.  \"Lady,\"\nsaid he, \"methinks that I see Geraint, and the maiden with him.  He\nis on horseback, but he has his walking gear upon him, and the maiden\nappears to be in white, seeming to be clad in a garment of linen.\"\n\"Assemble all the women,\" said Gwenhwyvar, \"and come to meet Geraint,\nto welcome him, and wish him joy.\"  And Gwenhwyvar went to meet\nGeraint and the maiden.  And when Geraint came to the place where\nGwenhwyvar was, he saluted her.  \"Heaven prosper thee,\" said she,\n\"and welcome to thee.  And thy career has been successful, and\nfortunate, and resistless, and glorious.  And Heaven reward thee,\nthat thou hast so proudly caused me to have retribution.\"  \"Lady,\"\nsaid he, \"I earnestly desired to obtain thee satisfaction according\nto thy will; and, behold, here is the maiden through whom thou hadst\nthy revenge.\"  \"Verily,\" said Gwenhwyvar, \"the welcome of Heaven be\nunto her; and it is fitting that we should receive her joyfully.\"\nThen they went in, and dismounted.  And Geraint came to where Arthur\nwas, and saluted him.  \"Heaven protect thee,\" said Arthur, \"and the\nwelcome of Heaven be unto thee.  And since Edeyrn the son of Nudd has\nreceived his overthrow and wounds from thy hands, thou hast had a\nprosperous career.\"  \"Not upon me be the blame,\" said Geraint, \"it\nwas through the arrogance of Edeyrn the son of Nudd himself that we\nwere not friends.  I would not quit him until I knew who he was, and\nuntil the one had vanquished the other.\"  \"Now,\" said Arthur, \"where\nis the maiden for whom I heard thou didst give challenge?\"  \"She is\ngone with Gwenhwyvar to her chamber.\"\n\nThen went Arthur to see the maiden.  And Arthur, and all his\ncompanions, and his whole Court, were glad concerning the maiden.\nAnd certain were they all, that had her array been suitable to her\nbeauty, they had never seen a maid fairer than she.  And Arthur gave\naway the maiden to Geraint.  And the usual bond made between two\npersons was made between Geraint and the maiden, and the choicest of\nall Gwenhwyvar's apparel was given to the maiden; and thus arrayed,\nshe appeared comely and graceful to all who beheld her.  And that day\nand that night were spent in abundance of minstrelsy, and ample gifts\nof liquor, and a multitude of games.  And when it was time for them\nto go to sleep, they went.  And in the chamber where the couch of\nArthur and Gwenhwyvar was, the couch of Geraint and Enid was\nprepared.  And from that time she became his bride.  And the next day\nArthur satisfied all the claimants upon Geraint with bountiful gifts.\nAnd the maiden took up her abode in the palace; and she had many\ncompanions, both men and women, and there was no maiden more esteemed\nthan she in the Island of Britain.\n\nThen spake Gwenhwyvar.  \"Rightly did I judge,\" said she, \"concerning\nthe head of the stag, that it should not be given to any until\nGeraint's return; and, behold, here is a fit occasion for bestowing\nit.  Let it be given to Enid the daughter of Ynywl, the most\nillustrious maiden.  And I do not believe that any will begrudge it\nher, for between her and every one here there exists nothing but love\nand friendship.\"  Much applauded was this by them all, and by Arthur\nalso.  And the head of the stag was given to Enid.  And thereupon her\nfame increased, and her friends thenceforward became more in number\nthan before.  And Geraint from that time forth loved the stag, and\nthe tournament, and hard encounters; and he came victorious from them\nall.  And a year, and a second, and a third, he proceeded thus, until\nhis fame had flown over the face of the kingdom.\n\n\nAnd once upon a time Arthur was holding his Court at Caerlleon upon\nUsk, at Whitsuntide.  And, behold, there came to him ambassadors,\nwise and prudent, full of knowledge, and eloquent of speech, and they\nsaluted Arthur.  \"Heaven prosper you,\" said Arthur, \"and the welcome\nof Heaven be unto you.  And whence do you come?\"  \"We come, Lord,\"\nsaid they, \"from Cornwall; and we are ambassadors from Erbin the son\nof Custennin, thy uncle, and our mission is unto thee.  And he greets\nthee well, as an uncle should greet his nephew, and as a vassal\nshould greet his lord.  And he represents unto thee that he waxes\nheavy and feeble, and is advancing in years.  And the neighbouring\nchiefs, knowing this, grow insolent towards him, and covet his land\nand possessions.  And he earnestly beseeches thee, Lord, to permit\nGeraint his son to return to him, to protect his possessions, and to\nbecome acquainted with his boundaries.  And unto him he represents\nthat it were better for him to spend the flower of his youth and the\nprime of his age in preserving his own boundaries, than in\ntournaments, which are productive of no profit, although he obtains\nglory in them.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Arthur, \"go, and divest yourselves of your\naccoutrements, and take food, and refresh yourselves after your\nfatigues; and before you go forth hence you shall have an answer.\"\nAnd they went to eat.  And Arthur considered that it would go hard\nwith him to let Geraint depart from him and from his Court; neither\ndid he think it fair that his cousin should be restrained from going\nto protect his dominions and his boundaries, seeing that his father\nwas unable to do so.  No less was the grief and regret of Gwenhwyvar,\nand all her women, and all her damsels, through fear that the maiden\nwould leave them.  And that day and that night were spent in\nabundance of feasting.  And Arthur showed Geraint the cause of the\nmission, and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of Cornwall.\n\"Truly,\" said Geraint, \"be it to my advantage or disadvantage, Lord,\nI will do according to thy will concerning this embassy.\"  \"Behold,\"\nsaid Arthur, \"though it grieves me to part with thee, it is my\ncounsel that thou go to dwell in thine own dominions, and to defend\nthy boundaries, and to take with thee to accompany thee as many as\nthou wilt of those thou lovest best among my faithful ones, and among\nthy friends, and among thy companions in arms.\"  \"Heaven reward thee;\nand this will I do,\" said Geraint.  \"What discourse,\" said\nGwenhwyvar, \"do I hear between you?  Is it of those who are to\nconduct Geraint to his country?\"  \"It is,\" said Arthur.  \"Then it is\nneedful for me to consider,\" said she, \"concerning companions and a\nprovision for the lady that is with me?\"  \"Thou wilt do well,\" said\nArthur.\n\nAnd that night they went to sleep.  And the next day the ambassadors\nwere permitted to depart, and they were told that Geraint should\nfollow them.  And on the third day Geraint set forth, and many went\nwith him.  Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, and Riogonedd the son of the\nking of Ireland, and Ondyaw the son of the duke of Burgundy, Gwilim\nthe son of the ruler of the Franks, Howel the son of Emyr of\nBrittany, Elivry, and Nawkyrd, Gwynn the son of Tringad, Goreu the\nson of Custennin, Gweir Gwrhyd Vawr, Garannaw the son of Golithmer,\nPeredur the son of Evrawc, Gwynnllogell, Gwyr a judge in the Court of\nArthur, Dyvyr the son of Alun of Dyved, Gwrei Gwalstawd Ieithoedd,\nBedwyr the son of Bedrawd, Hadwry the son of Gwryon, Kai the son of\nKynyr, Odyar the Frank, the Steward of Arthur's Court, and Edeyrn the\nson of Nudd.  Said Geraint, \"I think that I shall have enough of\nknighthood with me.\"  \"Yes,\" said Arthur, \"but it will not be fitting\nfor thee to take Edeyrn with thee, although he is well, until peace\nshall be made between him and Gwenhwyvar.\"  \"Gwenhwyvar can permit\nhim to go with me, if he give sureties.\"  \"If she please, she can let\nhim go without sureties, for enough of pain and affliction has he\nsuffered for the insult which the maiden received from the dwarf.\"\n\"Truly,\" said Gwenhwyvar, \"since it seems well to thee and to\nGeraint, I will do this gladly, Lord.\"  Then she permitted Edeyrn\nfreely to depart.  And many there were who accompanied Geraint, and\nthey set forth; and never was there seen a fairer host journeying\ntowards the Severn.  And on the other side of the Severn were the\nnobles of Erbin the son of Custennin, and his foster-father at their\nhead, to welcome Geraint with gladness; and many of the women of the\nCourt, with his mother, came to receive Enid the daughter of Ynywl,\nhis wife.  And there was great rejoicing and gladness throughout the\nwhole Court, and throughout all the country, concerning Geraint,\nbecause of the greatness of their love towards him, and of the\ngreatness of the fame which he had gained since he went from amongst\nthem, and because he was come to take possession of his dominions and\nto preserve his boundaries.  And they came to the Court.  And in the\nCourt they had ample entertainment, and a multitude of gifts and\nabundance of liquor, and a sufficiency of service, and a variety of\nminstrelsy and of games.  And to do honour to Geraint, all the chief\nmen of the country were invited that night to visit him.  And they\npassed that day and that night in the utmost enjoyment.  And at dawn\nnext day Erbin arose, and summoned to him Geraint, and the noble\npersons who had borne him company.  And he said to Geraint, \"I am a\nfeeble and aged man, and whilst I was able to maintain the dominion\nfor thee and for myself, I did so.  But thou art young, and in the\nflower of thy vigour and of thy youth; henceforth do thou preserve\nthy possessions.\"  \"Truly,\" said Geraint, \"with my consent thou shalt\nnot give the power over thy dominions at this time into my hands, and\nthou shalt not take me from Arthur's Court.\"  \"Into thy hands will I\ngive them,\" said Erbin, \"and this day also shalt thou receive the\nhomage of thy subjects.\"\n\nThen said Gwalchmai, \"It were better for thee to satisfy those who\nhave boons to ask, to-day, and to-morrow thou canst receive the\nhomage of thy dominions.\"  So all that had boons to ask were summoned\ninto one place.  And Kadyrieith came to them, to know what were their\nrequests.  And every one asked that which he desired.  And the\nfollowers of Arthur began to make gifts, and immediately the men of\nCornwall came, and gave also.  And they were not long in giving, so\neager was every one to bestow gifts.  And of those who came to ask\ngifts, none departed unsatisfied.  And that day and that night were\nspent in the utmost enjoyment.\n\nAnd the next day, at dawn, Erbin desired Geraint to send messengers\nto the men, to ask them whether it was displeasing to them that he\nshould come to receive their homage, and whether they had anything to\nobject to him.  Then Geraint sent ambassadors to the men of Cornwall,\nto ask them this.  And they all said that it would be the fulness of\njoy and honour to them for Geraint to come and receive their homage.\nSo he received the homage of such as were there.  And they remained\nwith him till the third night.  And the day after the followers of\nArthur intended to go away.  \"It is too soon for you to go away yet,\"\nsaid he, \"stay with me until I have finished receiving the homage of\nmy chief men, who have agreed to come to me.\"  And they remained with\nhim until he had done so.  Then they set forth towards the Court of\nArthur; and Geraint went to bear them company, and Enid also, as far\nas Diganhwy:  there they parted.  Then Ondyaw the son of the duke of\nBurgundy said to Geraint, \"Go first of all and visit the uppermost\nparts of thy dominions, and see well to the boundaries of thy\nterritories; and if thou hast any trouble respecting them, send unto\nthy companions.\"  \"Heaven reward thee,\" said Geraint, \"and this will\nI do.\"  And Geraint journeyed to the uttermost part of his dominions.\nAnd experienced guides, and the chief men of his country, went with\nhim.  And the furthermost point that they showed him he kept\npossession of.\n\nAnd, as he had been used to do when he was at Arthur's Court, he\nfrequented tournaments.  And he became acquainted with valiant and\nmighty men, until he had gained as much fame there as he had formerly\ndone elsewhere.  And he enriched his Court, and his companions, and\nhis nobles, with the best horses and the best arms, and with the best\nand most valuable jewels, and he ceased not until his fame had flown\nover the face of the whole kingdom.  And when he knew that it was\nthus, he began to love ease and pleasure, for there was no one who\nwas worth his opposing.  And he loved his wife, and liked to continue\nin the palace, with minstrelsy and diversions.  And for a long time\nhe abode at home.  And after that he began to shut himself up in the\nchamber of his wife, and he took no delight in anything besides,\ninsomuch that he gave up the friendship of his nobles, together with\nhis hunting and his amusements, and lost the hearts of all the host\nin his Court; and there was murmuring and scoffing concerning him\namong the inhabitants of the palace, on account of his relinquishing\nso completely their companionship for the love of his wife.  And\nthese tidings came to Erbin.  And when Erbin had heard these things,\nhe spoke unto Enid, and inquired of her whether it was she that had\ncaused Geraint to act thus, and to forsake his people and his hosts.\n\"Not I, by my confession unto Heaven,\" said she, \"there is nothing\nmore hateful to me than this.\"  And she knew not what she should do,\nfor, although it was hard for her to own this to Geraint, yet was it\nnot more easy for her to listen to what she heard, without warning\nGeraint concerning it.  And she was very sorrowful.\n\nAnd one morning in the summer time, they were upon their couch, and\nGeraint lay upon the edge of it.  And Enid was without sleep in the\napartment, which had windows of glass.  And the sun shone upon the\ncouch.  And the clothes had slipped from off his arms and his breast,\nand he was asleep.  Then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his\nappearance, and she said, \"Alas, and am I the cause that these arms\nand this breast have lost their glory and the warlike fame which they\nonce so richly enjoyed!\"  And as she said this, the tears dropped\nfrom her eyes, and they fell upon his breast.  And the tears she\nshed, and the words she had spoken, awoke him; and another thing\ncontributed to awaken him, and that was the idea that it was not in\nthinking of him that she spoke thus, but that it was because she\nloved some other man more than him, and that she wished for other\nsociety, and thereupon Geraint was troubled in his mind, and he\ncalled his squire; and when he came to him, \"Go quickly,\" said he,\n\"and prepare my horse and my arms, and make them ready.  And do thou\narise,\" said he to Enid, \"and apparel thyself; and cause thy horse to\nbe accoutred, and clothe thee in the worst riding-dress that thou\nhast in thy possession.  And evil betide me,\" said he, \"if thou\nreturnest here until thou knowest whether I have lost my strength so\ncompletely as thou didst say.  And if it be so, it will then be easy\nfor thee to seek the society thou didst wish for of him of whom thou\nwast thinking.\"  So she arose, and clothed herself in her meanest\ngarments.  \"I know nothing, Lord,\" said she, \"of thy meaning.\"\n\"Neither wilt thou know at this time,\" said he.\n\nThen Geraint went to see Erbin.  \"Sir,\" said he, \"I am going upon a\nquest, and I am not certain when I may come back.  Take heed,\ntherefore, unto thy possessions, until my return.\"  \"I will do so,\"\nsaid he, \"but it is strange to me that thou shouldest go so suddenly.\nAnd who will proceed with thee, since thou art not strong enough to\ntraverse the land of Lloegyr alone?\"  \"But one person only will go\nwith me.\"  \"Heaven counsel thee, my son,\" said Erbin, \"and may many\nattach themselves to thee in Lloegyr.\"  Then went Geraint to the\nplace where his horse was, and it was equipped with foreign armour,\nheavy and shining.  And he desired Enid to mount her horse, and to\nride forward, and to keep a long way before him.  \"And whatever thou\nmayest see, and whatever thou mayest hear concerning me,\" said he,\n\"do thou not turn back.  And unless I speak unto thee, say not thou\none word either.\"  And they set forward.  And he did not choose the\npleasantest and most frequented road, but that which was the wildest\nand most beset by thieves, and robbers, and venomous animals.  And\nthey came to a high road, which they followed till they saw a vast\nforest, and they went towards it, and they saw four armed horsemen\ncome forth from the forest.  When the horsemen had beheld them, one\nof them said to the others, \"Behold, here is a good occasion for us\nto capture two horses and armour, and a lady likewise; for this we\nshall have no difficulty in doing against yonder single knight, who\nhangs his head so pensively and heavily.\"  And Enid heard this\ndiscourse, and she knew not what she should do through fear of\nGeraint, who had told her to be silent.  \"The vengeance of Heaven be\nupon me,\" she said, \"if I would not rather receive my death from his\nhand than from the hand of any other; and though he should slay me\nyet will I speak to him, lest I should have the misery to witness his\ndeath.\"  So she waited for Geraint until he came near to her.\n\"Lord,\" said she, \"didst thou hear the words of those men concerning\nthee?\"  Then he lifted up his eyes, and looked at her angrily.  \"Thou\nhadst only,\" said he, \"to hold thy peace as I bade thee.  I wish but\nfor silence, and not for warning.  And though thou shouldest desire\nto see my defeat and my death by the hands of those men, yet do I\nfeel no dread.\"  Then the foremost of them couched his lance, and\nrushed upon Geraint.  And he received him, and that not feebly.  But\nhe let the thrust go by him, while he struck the horseman upon the\ncentre of his shield in such a manner that his shield was split, and\nhis armour broken, and so that a cubit's length of the shaft of\nGeraint's lance passed through his body, and sent him to the earth,\nthe length of the lance over his horse's crupper.  Then the second\nhorseman attacked him furiously, being wroth at the death of his\ncompanion.  But with one thrust Geraint overthrew him also, and\nkilled him as he had done the other.  Then the third set upon him,\nand he killed him in like manner.  And thus also he slew the fourth.\nSad and sorrowful was the maiden as she saw all this.  Geraint\ndismounted from his horse, and took the arms of the men he had slain,\nand placed them upon their saddles, and tied together the reins of\ntheir horses, and he mounted his horse again.  \"Behold what thou must\ndo,\" said he; \"take the four horses, and drive them before thee, and\nproceed forward, as I bade thee just now.  And say not one word unto\nme, unless I speak first unto thee.  And I declare unto Heaven,\" said\nhe, \"if thou doest not thus, it will be to thy cost.\"  \"I will do, as\nfar as I can, Lord,\" said she, \"according to thy desire.\"  Then they\nwent forward through the forest; and when they left the forest, they\ncame to a vast plain, in the centre of which was a group of thickly\ntangled copse-wood; and from out thereof they beheld three horsemen\ncoming towards them, well equipped with armour, both they and their\nhorses.  Then the maiden looked steadfastly upon them; and when they\nhad come near, she heard them say one to another, \"Behold, here is a\ngood arrival for us; here are coming for us four horses and four\nsuits of armour.  We shall easily obtain them spite of yonder\ndolorous knight, and the maiden also will fall into our power.\"\n\"This is but too true,\" said she to herself, \"for my husband is tired\nwith his former combat.  The vengeance of Heaven will be upon me,\nunless I warn him of this.\"  So the maiden waited until Geraint came\nup to her.  \"Lord,\" said she, \"dust thou not hear the discourse of\nyonder men concerning thee?\"  \"What was it?\" asked he.  \"They say to\none another, that they will easily obtain all this spoil.\"  \"I\ndeclare to Heaven,\" he answered, \"that their words are less grievous\nto me than that thou wilt not be silent, and abide by my counsel.\"\n\"My Lord,\" said she, \"I feared lest they should surprise thee\nunawares.\"  \"Hold thy peace, then,\" said he, \"do not I desire\nsilence?\"  And thereupon one of the horsemen couched his lance, and\nattacked Geraint.  And he made a thrust at him, which he thought\nwould be very effective; but Geraint received it carelessly, and\nstruck it aside, and then he rushed upon him, and aimed at the centre\nof his person, and from the shock of man and horse, the quantity of\nhis armour did not avail him, and the head of the lance and part of\nthe shaft passed through him, so that he was carried to the ground an\narm and a spear's length over the crupper of his horse.  And both the\nother horsemen came forward in their turn, but their onset was not\nmore successful than that of their companion.  And the maiden stood\nby, looking at all this; and on the one hand she was in trouble lest\nGeraint should be wounded in his encounter with the men, and on the\nother hand she was joyful to see him victorious.  Then Geraint\ndismounted, and bound the three suits of armour upon the three\nsaddles, and he fastened the reins of all the horses together, so\nthat he had seven horses with him.  And he mounted his own horse, and\ncommanded the maiden to drive forward the others.  \"It is no more use\nfor me to speak to thee than to refrain, for thou wilt not attend to\nmy advice.\"  \"I will do so, as far as I am able, Lord,\" said she;\n\"but I cannot conceal from thee the fierce and threatening words\nwhich I may hear against thee, Lord, from such strange people as\nthose that haunt this wilderness.\"  \"I declare to Heaven,\" said he,\n\"that I desire nought but silence; therefore, hold thy peace.\"  \"I\nwill, Lord, while I can.\"  And the maiden went on with the horses\nbefore her, and she pursued her way straight onwards.  And from the\ncopse-wood already mentioned, they journeyed over a vast and dreary\nopen plain.  And at a great distance from them they beheld a wood,\nand they could see neither end nor boundary to the wood, except on\nthat side that was nearest to them, and they went towards it.  Then\nthere came from out the wood five horsemen, eager, and bold, and\nmighty, and strong, mounted upon chargers that were powerful, and\nlarge of bone, and high-mettled, and proudly snorting, and both the\nmen and the horses were well equipped with arms.  And when they drew\nnear to them, Enid heard them say, \"Behold, here is a fine booty\ncoming to us, which we shall obtain easily and without labour, for we\nshall have no trouble in taking all those horses and arms, and the\nlady also, from yonder single knight, so doleful and sad.\"\n\nSorely grieved was the maiden upon hearing this discourse, so that\nshe knew not in the world what she should do.  At last, however, she\ndetermined to warn Geraint; so she turned her horse's head towards\nhim.  \"Lord,\" said she, \"if thou hadst heard as I did what yonder\nhorsemen said concerning thee, thy heaviness would be greater than it\nis.\"  Angrily and bitterly did Geraint smile upon her, and he said,\n\"Thee do I hear doing everything that I forbade thee; but it may be\nthat thou will repent this yet.\"  And immediately, behold, the men\nmet them, and victoriously and gallantly did Geraint overcome them\nall five.  And he placed the five suits of armour upon the five\nsaddles, and tied together the reins of the twelve horses, and gave\nthem in charge to Enid.  \"I know not,\" said he, \"what good it is for\nme to order thee; but this time I charge thee in an especial manner.\"\nSo the maiden went forward towards the wood, keeping in advance of\nGeraint, as he had desired her; and it grieved him as much as his\nwrath would permit, to see a maiden so illustrious as she having so\nmuch trouble with the care of the horses.  Then they reached the\nwood, and it was both deep and vast; and in the wood night overtook\nthem.  \"Ah, maiden,\" said he, \"it is vain to attempt proceeding\nforward!\"  \"Well, Lord,\" said she, \"whatsoever thou wishest, we will\ndo.\"  \"It will be best for us,\" he answered, \"to turn out of the\nwood, and to rest, and wait for the day, in order to pursue our\njourney.\"  \"That will we, gladly,\" said she.  And they did so.\nHaving dismounted himself, he took her down from her horse.  \"I\ncannot, by any means, refrain from sleep, through weariness,\" said\nhe.  \"Do thou, therefore, watch the horses, and sleep not.\"  \"I will,\nLord,\" said she.  Then he went to sleep in his armour, and thus\npassed the night, which was not long at that season.  And when she\nsaw the dawn of day appear, she looked around her, to see if he were\nwaking, and thereupon he woke.  \"My Lord,\" she said, \"I have desired\nto awake thee for some time.\"  But he spake nothing to her about\nfatigue, as he had desired her to be silent.  Then he arose, and said\nunto her, \"Take the horses, and ride on; and keep straight on before\nthee as thou didst yesterday.\"  And early in the day they left the\nwood, and they came to an open country, with meadows on one hand, and\nmowers mowing the meadows.  And there was a river before them, and\nthe horses bent down, and drank the water.  And they went up out of\nthe river by a lofty steep; and there they met a slender stripling,\nwith a satchel about his neck, and they saw that there was something\nin the satchel, but they knew not what it was.  And he had a small\nblue pitcher in his hand, and a bowl on the mouth of the pitcher.\nAnd the youth saluted Geraint.  \"Heaven prosper thee,\" said Geraint,\n\"and whence dost thou come?\"  \"I come,\" said he, \"from the city that\nlies before thee.  My Lord,\" he added, \"will it be displeasing to\nthee if I ask whence thou comest also?\"  \"By no means--through yonder\nwood did I come.\"  \"Thou camest not through the wood to-day.\"  \"No,\"\nhe replied, \"we were in the wood last night.\"  \"I warrant,\" said the\nyouth, \"that thy condition there last night was not the most\npleasant, and that thou hadst neither meat nor drink.\"  \"No, by my\nfaith,\" said he.  \"Wilt thou follow my counsel,\" said the youth, \"and\ntake thy meal from me?\"  \"What sort of meal?\" he inquired.  \"The\nbreakfast which is sent for yonder mowers, nothing less than bread\nand meat and wine; and if thou wilt, Sir, they shall have none of\nit.\"  \"I will,\" said he, \"and Heaven reward thee for it.\"\n\nSo Geraint alighted, and the youth took the maiden from off her\nhorse.  Then they washed, and took their repast.  And the youth cut\nthe bread in slices, and gave them drink, and served them withal.\nAnd when they had finished, the youth arose, and said to Geraint, \"My\nLord, with thy permission, I will now go and fetch some food for the\nmowers.\"  \"Go, first, to the town,\" said Geraint, \"and take a lodging\nfor me in the best place that thou knowest, and the most commodious\none for the horses, and take thou whichever horse and arms thou\nchoosest in payment for thy service and thy gift.\"  \"Heaven reward\nthee, Lord,\" said the youth, \"and this would be ample to repay\nservices much greater than those I have rendered unto thee.\"  And to\nthe town went the youth, and he took the best and the most pleasant\nlodgings that he knew; and after that he went to the palace, having\nthe horse and armour with him, and proceeded to the place where the\nEarl was, and told him all his adventure.  \"I go now, Lord,\" said he,\n\"to meet the young man, and to conduct him to his lodging.\"  \"Go,\ngladly,\" said the Earl, \"and right joyfully shall he be received\nhere, if he so come.\"  And the youth went to meet Geraint, and told\nhim that he would be received gladly by the Earl in his own palace;\nbut he would go only to his lodgings.  And he had a goodly chamber,\nin which was plenty of straw, and drapery, and a spacious and\ncommodious place he had for the horses; and the youth prepared for\nthem plenty of provender.  And after they had disarrayed themselves,\nGeraint spoke thus to Enid:  \"Go,\" said he, \"to the other side of the\nchamber, and come not to this side of the house; and thou mayest call\nto thee the woman of the house, if thou wilt.\"  \"I will do, Lord,\"\nsaid she, \"as thou sayest.\"  And thereupon the man of the house came\nto Geraint, and welcomed him.  \"Oh, chieftain,\" he said, \"hast thou\ntaken thy meal?\"  \"I have,\" said he.  Then the youth spoke to him,\nand inquired if he would not drink something before he met the Earl.\n\"Truly I will,\" said he.  So the youth went into the town, and\nbrought them drink.  And they drank.  \"I must needs sleep,\" said\nGeraint.  \"Well,\" said the youth; \"and whilst thou sleepest, I will\ngo to see the Earl.\"  \"Go, gladly,\" he said, \"and come here again\nwhen I require thee.\"  And Geraint went to sleep; and so did Enid\nalso.\n\nAnd the youth came to the place where the Earl was, and the Earl\nasked him where the lodgings of the knight were, and he told him.  \"I\nmust go,\" said the youth, \"to wait on him in the evening.\"  \"Go,\"\nanswered the Earl, \"and greet him well from me, and tell him that in\nthe evening I will go to see him.\"  \"This will I do,\" said the youth.\nSo he came when it was time for them to awake.  And they arose, and\nwent forth.  And when it was time for them to take their food, they\ntook it.  And the youth served them.  And Geraint inquired of the man\nof the house, whether there were any of his companions that he wished\nto invite to him, and he said that there were.  \"Bring them hither,\nand entertain them at my cost with the best thou canst buy in the\ntown.\"\n\nAnd the man of the house brought there those whom he chose, and\nfeasted them at Geraint's expense.  Thereupon, behold, the Earl came\nto visit Geraint, and his twelve honourable knights with him.  And\nGeraint rose up, and welcomed him.  \"Heaven preserve thee,\" said the\nEarl.  Then they all sat down according to their precedence in\nhonour.  And the Earl conversed with Geraint, and inquired of him the\nobject of his journey.  \"I have none,\" he replied, \"but to seek\nadventures, and to follow my own inclination.\"  Then the Earl cast\nhis eye upon Enid, and he looked at her steadfastly.  And he thought\nhe had never seen a maiden fairer or more comely than she.  And he\nset all his thoughts and his affections upon her.  Then he asked of\nGeraint, \"Have I thy permission to go and converse with yonder\nmaiden, for I see that she is apart from thee?\"  \"Thou hast it\ngladly,\" said he.  So the Earl went to the place where the maiden\nwas, and spake with her.  \"Ah, maiden,\" said he, \"it cannot be\npleasant to thee to journey thus with yonder man!\"  \"It is not\nunpleasant to me,\" said she, \"to journey the same road that he\njourneys.\"  \"Thou hast neither youths nor maidens to serve thee,\"\nsaid he.  \"Truly,\" she replied, \"it is more pleasant for me to follow\nyonder man, than to be served by youths and maidens.\"  \"I will give\nthee good counsel,\" said he.  \"All my Earldom will I place in thy\npossession, if thou wilt dwell with me.\"  \"That will I not, by\nHeaven,\" she said; \"yonder man was the first to whom my faith was\never pledged; and shall I prove inconstant to him!\"  \"Thou art in the\nwrong,\" said the Earl; \"if I slay the man yonder, I can keep thee\nwith me as long as I choose; and when thou no longer pleasest me I\ncan turn thee away.  But if thou goest with me by thine own good\nwill, I protest that our union shall continue eternal and undivided\nas long as I remain alive.\"  Then she pondered these words of his,\nand she considered that it was advisable to encourage him in his\nrequest.  \"Behold, then, chieftain, this is most expedient for thee\nto do to save me any needless imputation; come here to-morrow, and\ntake me away as though I knew nothing thereof.\"  \"I will do so,\" said\nhe.  So he arose, and took his leave, and went forth with his\nattendants.  And she told not then to Geraint any of the conversation\nwhich she had had with the Earl, lest it should rouse his anger, and\ncause him uneasiness and care.\n\nAnd at the usual hour they went to sleep.  And at the beginning of\nthe night Enid slept a little; and at midnight she arose, and placed\nall Geraint's armour together, so that it might be ready to put on.\nAnd although fearful of her errand, she came to the side of Geraint's\nbed; and she spoke to him softly and gently, saying, \"My Lord, arise,\nand clothe thyself, for these were the words of the Earl to me, and\nhis intention concerning me.\"  So she told Geraint all that had\npassed.  And although he was wroth with her, he took warning, and\nclothed himself.  And she lighted a candle, that he might have light\nto do so.  \"Leave there the candle,\" said he, \"and desire the man of\nthe house to come here.\"  Then she went, and the man of the house\ncame to him.  \"Dost thou know how much I owe thee?\" asked Geraint.\n\"I think thou owest but little.\"  \"Take the eleven horses and the\neleven suits of armour.\"  \"Heaven reward thee, lord,\" said he, \"but I\nspent not the value of one suit of armour upon thee.\"  \"For that\nreason,\" said he, \"thou wilt be the richer.  And now, wilt thou come\nto guide me out of the town?\"  \"I will, gladly,\" said he, \"and in\nwhich direction dost thou intend to go?\"  \"I wish to leave the town\nby a different way from that by which I entered it.\"  So the man of\nthe lodgings accompanied him as far as he desired.  Then he bade the\nmaiden to go on before him; and she did so, and went straight\nforward, and his host returned home.  And he had only just reached\nhis house, when, behold, the greatest tumult approached that was ever\nheard.  And when he looked out, he saw fourscore knights in complete\narmour around the house, with the Earl Dwnn at their head.  \"Where is\nthe knight that was here?\" said the Earl.  \"By thy hand,\" said he,\n\"he went hence some time ago.\"  \"Wherefore, villain,\" said he, \"didst\nthou let him go without informing me?\"  \"My Lord, thou didst not\ncommand me to do so, else would I not have allowed him to depart.\"\n\"What way dost thou think that he took?\"  \"I know not, except that he\nwent along the high road.\"  And they turned their horses' heads that\nway, and seeing the tracks of the horses upon the high road, they\nfollowed.  And when the maiden beheld the dawning of the day, she\nlooked behind her, and saw vast clouds of dust coming nearer and\nnearer to her.  And thereupon she became uneasy, and she thought that\nit was the Earl and his host coming after them.  And thereupon she\nbeheld a knight appearing through the mist.  \"By my faith,\" said she,\n\"though he should slay me, it were better for me to receive my death\nat his hands, than to see him killed without warning him.  My Lord,\"\nshe said to him, \"seest thou yonder man hastening after thee, and\nmany others with him?\"  \"I do see him,\" said he; \"and in despite of\nall my orders, I see that thou wilt never keep silence.\"  Then he\nturned upon the knight, and with the first thrust he threw him down\nunder his horse's feet.  And as long as there remained one of the\nfourscore knights, he overthrew every one of them at the first onset.\nAnd from the weakest to the strongest, they all attacked him one\nafter the other, except the Earl:  and last of all the Earl came\nagainst him also.  And he broke his lance, and then he broke a\nsecond.  But Geraint turned upon him, and struck him with his lance\nupon the centre of his shield, so that by that single thrust the\nshield was split, and all his armour broken, and he himself was\nbrought over his horse's crupper to the ground, and was in peril of\nhis life.  And Geraint drew near to him; and at the noise of the\ntrampling of his horse the Earl revived.  \"Mercy, Lord,\" said he to\nGeraint.  And Geraint granted him mercy.  But through the hardness of\nthe ground where they had fallen, and the violence of the stroke\nwhich they had received, there was not a single knight amongst them\nthat escaped without receiving a fall, mortally severe, and\ngrievously painful, and desperately wounding, from the hand of\nGeraint.\n\nAnd Geraint journeyed along the high road that was before him, and\nthe maiden went on first; and near them they beheld a valley which\nwas the fairest ever seen, and which had a large river running\nthrough it; and there was a bridge over the river, and the high road\nled to the bridge.  And above the bridge upon the opposite side of\nthe river, they beheld a fortified town, the fairest ever seen.  And\nas they approached the bridge, Geraint saw coming towards him from a\nthick copse a man mounted upon a large and lofty steed, even of pace\nand spirited though tractable.  \"Ah, knight,\" said Geraint, \"whence\ncomest thou?\"  \"I come,\" said he, \"from the valley below us.\"  \"Canst\nthou tell me,\" said Geraint, \"who is the owner of this fair valley\nand yonder walled town?\"  \"I will tell thee, willingly,\" said he.\n\"Gwiffert Petit he is called by the Franks, but the Cymry call him\nthe Little King.\"  \"Can I go by yonder bridge,\" said Geraint, \"and by\nthe lower highway that is beneath the town?\"  Said the knight, \"Thou\ncanst not go by his tower on the other side of the bridge, unless\nthou dost intend to combat him; because it is his custom to encounter\nevery knight that comes upon his lands.\"  \"I declare to Heaven,\" said\nGeraint, \"that I will, nevertheless, pursue my journey that way.\"\n\"If thou dost so,\" said the knight, \"thou wilt probably meet with\nshame and disgrace in reward for thy daring.\"  Then Geraint proceeded\nalong the road that led to the town, and the road brought him to a\nground that was hard, and rugged, and high, and ridgy.  And as he\njourneyed thus, he beheld a knight following him upon a warhorse,\nstrong, and large, and proudly-stepping, and wide-hoofed, and broad-\nchested.  And he never saw a man of smaller stature than he who was\nupon the horse.  And both he and his horse were completely armed.\nWhen he had overtaken Geraint, he said to him, \"Tell me, chieftain,\nwhether it is through ignorance or through presumption that thou\nseekest to insult my dignity, and to infringe my rules.\"  \"Nay,\"\nanswered Geraint, \"I knew not this road was forbid to any.\"  \"Thou\ndidst know it,\" said the other; \"come with me to my Court, to give me\nsatisfaction.\"  \"That will I not, by my faith,\" said Geraint; \"I\nwould not go even to thy Lord's Court, excepting Arthur were thy\nLord.\"  \"By the hand of Arthur himself,\" said the knight, \"I will\nhave satisfaction of thee, or receive my overthrow at thy hands.\"\nAnd immediately they charged one another.  And a squire of his came\nto serve him with lances as he broke them.  And they gave each other\nsuch hard and severe strokes that their shields lost all their\ncolour.  But it was very difficult for Geraint to fight with him on\naccount of his small size, for he was hardly able to get a full aim\nat him with all the efforts he could make.  And they fought thus\nuntil their horses were brought down upon their knees; and at length\nGeraint threw the knight headlong to the ground; and then they fought\non foot, and they gave one another blows so boldly fierce, so\nfrequent, and so severely powerful, that their helmets were pierced,\nand their skullcaps were broken, and their arms were shattered, and\nthe light of their eyes was darkened by sweat and blood.  At the last\nGeraint became enraged, and he called to him all his strength; and\nboldly angry, and swiftly resolute, and furiously determined, he\nlifted up his sword, and struck him on the crown of his head a blow\nso mortally painful, so violent, so fierce, and so penetrating, that\nit cut through all his head armour, and his skin, and his flesh,\nuntil it wounded the very bone, and the sword flew out of the hand of\nthe Little King to the furthest end of the plain, and he besought\nGeraint that he would have mercy and compassion upon him.  \"Though\nthou hast been neither courteous nor just,\" said Geraint, \"thou shalt\nhave mercy, upon condition that thou wilt become my ally, and engage\nnever to fight against me again, but to come to my assistance\nwhenever thou hearest of my being in trouble.\"  \"This will I do,\ngladly, Lord,\" said he.  So he pledged him his faith thereof.  \"And\nnow, Lord, come with me,\" said he, \"to my Court yonder, to recover\nfrom thy weariness and fatigue.\"  \"That will I not, by Heaven,\" said\nhe.\n\nThen Gwiffert Petit beheld Enid where she stood, and it grieved him\nto see one of her noble mien appear so deeply afflicted.  And he said\nto Geraint, \"My Lord, thou doest wrong not to take repose, and\nrefresh thyself awhile; for, if thou meetest with any difficulty in\nthy present condition, it will not be easy for thee to surmount it.\"\nBut Geraint would do no other than proceed on his journey, and he\nmounted his horse in pain, and all covered with blood.  And the\nmaiden went on first, and they proceeded towards the wood which they\nsaw before them.\n\nAnd the heat of the sun was very great, and through the blood and\nsweat, Geraint's armour cleaved to his flesh; and when they came into\nthe wood, he stood under a tree, to avoid the sun's heat; and his\nwounds pained him more than they had done at the time when he\nreceived them.  And the maiden stood under another tree.  And lo!\nthey heard the sound of horns, and a tumultuous noise; and the\noccasion of it was, that Arthur and his company had come down to the\nwood.  And while Geraint was considering which way he should go to\navoid them, behold, he was espied by a foot-page, who was an\nattendant on the Steward of the Household; and he went to the\nSteward, and told him what kind of man he had seen in the wood.  Then\nthe Steward caused his horse to be saddled, and he took his lance and\nhis shield, and went to the place where Geraint was.  \"Ah, knight!\"\nsaid he, \"what dost thou here?\"  \"I am standing under a shady tree,\nto avoid the heat and the rays of the sun.\"  \"Wherefore is thy\njourney, and who art thou?\"  \"I seek adventures, and go where I\nlist.\"  \"Indeed,\" said Kai; \"then come with me to see Arthur, who is\nhere hard by.\"  \"That will I not, by Heaven,\" said Geraint.  \"Thou\nmust needs come,\" said Kai.  Then Geraint knew who he was, but Kai\ndid not know Geraint.  And Kai attacked Geraint as best he could.\nAnd Geraint became wroth, and he struck him with the shaft of his\nlance, so that he rolled headlong to the ground.  But chastisement\nworse than this would he not inflict on him.\n\nScared and wildly Kai arose, and he mounted his horse, and went back\nto his lodging.  And thence he proceeded to Gwalchmai's tent.  \"Oh,\nSir,\" said he to Gwalchmai, \"I was told by one of the attendants,\nthat he saw in the wood above a wounded knight, having on battered\narmour; and if thou dost right, thou wilt go and see if this be\ntrue.\"  \"I care not if I do so,\" said Gwalchmai.  \"Take, then, thy\nhorse, and some of thy armour,\" said Kai; \"for I hear that he is not\nover courteous to those who approach him.\"  So Gwalchmai took his\nspear and his shield, and mounted his horse, and came to the spot\nwhere Geraint was.  \"Sir Knight,\" said he, \"wherefore is thy\njourney?\"  \"I journey for my own pleasure, and to seek the adventures\nof the world.\"  \"Wilt thou tell me who thou art; or wilt thou come\nand visit Arthur, who is near at hand?\"  \"I will make no alliance\nwith thee, nor will I go and visit Arthur,\" said he.  And he knew\nthat it was Gwalchmai, but Gwalchmai knew him not.  \"I purpose not to\nleave thee,\" said Gwalchmai, \"till I know who thou art.\"  And he\ncharged him with his lance, and struck him on his shield, so that the\nshaft was shivered into splinters, and their horses were front to\nfront.  Then Gwalchmai gazed fixedly upon him, and he knew him.  \"Ah,\nGeraint,\" said he, \"is it thou that art here?\"  \"I am not Geraint,\"\nsaid he.  \"Geraint thou art, by Heaven,\" he replied, \"and a wretched\nand insane expedition is this.\"  Then he looked around, and beheld\nEnid, and he welcomed her gladly.  \"Geraint,\" said Gwalchmai, \"come\nthou and see Arthur; he is thy lord and thy cousin.\"  \"I will not,\"\nsaid he, \"for I am not in a fit state to go and see any one.\"\nThereupon, behold, one of the pages came after Gwalchmai to speak to\nhim.  So he sent him to apprise Arthur that Geraint was there\nwounded, and that he would not go to visit him, and that it was\npitiable to see the plight that he was in.  And this he did without\nGeraint's knowledge, inasmuch as he spoke in a whisper to the page.\n\"Entreat Arthur,\" said he, \"to have his tent brought near to the\nroad, for he will not meet him willingly, and it is not easy to\ncompel him in the mood he is in.\"  So the page came to Arthur, and\ntold him this.  And he caused his tent to be removed unto the side of\nthe road.  And the maiden rejoiced in her heart.  And Gwalchmai led\nGeraint onwards along the road, till they came to the place where\nArthur was encamped, and the pages were pitching his tent by the\nroadside.  \"Lord,\" said Geraint, \"all hail unto thee.\"  \"Heaven\nprosper thee; and who art thou?\" said Arthur.  \"It is Geraint,\" said\nGwalchmai, \"and of his own free will would he not come to meet thee.\"\n\"Verily,\" said Arthur, \"he is bereft of his reason.\"  Then came Enid,\nand saluted Arthur.  \"Heaven protect thee,\" said he.  And thereupon\nhe caused one of the pages to take her from her horse.  \"Alas! Enid,\"\nsaid Arthur, \"what expedition is this?\"  \"I know not, Lord,\" said\nshe, \"save that it behoves me to journey by the same road that he\njourneys.\"  \"My Lord,\" said Geraint, \"with thy permission we will\ndepart.\"  \"Whither wilt thou go?\" said Arthur.  \"Thou canst not\nproceed now, unless it be unto thy death.\"  \"He will not suffer\nhimself to be invited by me,\" said Gwalchmai.  \"But by me he will,\"\nsaid Arthur; \"and, moreover, he does not go from here until he is\nhealed.\"  \"I had rather, Lord,\" said Geraint, \"that thou wouldest let\nme go forth.\"  \"That will I not, I declare to Heaven,\" said he.  Then\nhe caused a maiden to be sent for to conduct Enid to the tent where\nGwenhwyvar's chamber was.  And Gwenhwyvar and all her women were\njoyful at her coming; and they took off her riding-dress, and placed\nother garments upon her.  Arthur also called Kadyrieith, and ordered\nhim to pitch a tent for Geraint and the physicians; and he enjoined\nhim to provide him with abundance of all that might be requisite for\nhim.  And Kadyrieith did as he had commanded him.  And Morgan Tud and\nhis disciples were brought to Geraint.\n\nAnd Arthur and his hosts remained there nearly a month, whilst\nGeraint was being healed.  And when he was fully recovered, Geraint\ncame to Arthur, and asked his permission to depart.  \"I know not if\nthou art quite well.\"  \"In truth I am, Lord,\" said Geraint.  \"I shall\nnot believe thee concerning that, but the physicians that were with\nthee.\"  So Arthur caused the physicians to be summoned to him, and\nasked them if it were true.  \"It is true, Lord,\" said Morgan Tud.  So\nthe next day Arthur permitted him to go forth, and he pursued his\njourney.  And on the same day Arthur removed thence.  And Geraint\ndesired Enid to go on, and to keep before him, as she had formerly\ndone.  And she went forward along the high road.  And as they\njourneyed thus, they heard an exceeding loud wailing near to them.\n\"Stay thou here,\" said he, \"and I will go and see what is the cause\nof this wailing.\"  \"I will,\" said she.  Then he went forward unto an\nopen glade that was near the road.  And in the glade he saw two\nhorses, one having a man's saddle, and the other a woman's saddle\nupon it.  And, behold, there was a knight lying dead in his armour,\nand a young damsel in a riding-dress standing over him, lamenting.\n\"Ah! Lady,\" said Geraint, \"what hath befallen thee?\"  \"Behold,\" she\nanswered, \"I journeyed here with my beloved husband, when, lo! three\ngiants came upon us, and without any cause in the world, they slew\nhim.\"  \"Which way went they hence?\" said Geraint.  \"Yonder by the\nhigh road,\" she replied.  So he returned to Enid.  \"Go,\" said he, \"to\nthe lady that is below yonder, and await me there till I come.\"  She\nwas sad when he ordered her to do thus, but nevertheless she went to\nthe damsel, whom it was ruth to hear, and she felt certain that\nGeraint would never return.  Meanwhile Geraint followed the giants,\nand overtook them.  And each of them was greater of stature than\nthree other men, and a huge club was on the shoulder of each.  Then\nhe rushed upon one of them, and thrust his lance through his body.\nAnd having drawn it forth again, he pierced another of them through\nlikewise.  But the third turned upon him, and struck him with his\nclub, so that he split his shield, and crushed his shoulder, and\nopened his wounds anew, and all his blood began to flow from him.\nBut Geraint drew his sword, and attacked the giant, and gave him a\nblow on the crown of his head so severe, and fierce, and violent,\nthat his head and his neck were split down to his shoulders, and he\nfell dead.  So Geraint left him thus, and returned to Enid.  And when\nhe saw her, he fell down lifeless from his horse.  Piercing, and\nloud, and thrilling was the cry that Enid uttered.  And she came and\nstood over him where he had fallen.  And at the sound of her cries\ncame the Earl of Limours, and the host that journeyed with him, whom\nher lamentations brought out of their road.  And the Earl said to\nEnid, \"Alas, Lady, what hath befallen thee?\"  \"Ah! good Sir,\" said\nshe, \"the only man I have loved, or ever shall love, is slain.\"  Then\nhe said to the other, \"And what is the cause of thy grief?\"  \"They\nhave slain my beloved husband also,\" said she.  \"And who was it that\nslew them?\"  \"Some giants,\" she answered, \"slew my best-beloved, and\nthe other knight went in pursuit of them, and came back in the state\nthou seest, his blood flowing excessively; but it appears to me that\nhe did not leave the giants without killing some of them, if not\nall.\"  The Earl caused the knight that was dead to be buried, but he\nthought that there still remained some life in Geraint; and to see if\nhe yet would live, he had him carried with him in the hollow of his\nshield, and upon a bier.  And the two damsels went to the Court; and\nwhen they arrived there, Geraint was placed upon a litter-couch in\nfront of the table that was in the hall.  Then they all took off\ntheir travelling gear, and the Earl besought Enid to do the same, and\nto clothe herself in other garments.  \"I will not, by Heaven,\" said\nshe.  \"Ah! Lady,\" said he, \"be not so sorrowful for this matter.\"\n\"It were hard to persuade me to be otherwise,\" said she.  \"I will act\ntowards thee in such wise, that thou needest not be sorrowful,\nwhether yonder knight live or die.  Behold, a good Earldom, together\nwith myself, will I bestow on thee; be, therefore, happy and joyful.\"\n\"I declare to Heaven,\" said she, \"that henceforth I shall never be\njoyful while I live.\"  \"Come, then,\" said he, \"and eat.\"  \"No, by\nHeaven, I will not,\" she answered.  \"But, by Heaven, thou shalt,\"\nsaid he.  So he took her with him to the table against her will, and\nmany times desired her to eat.  \"I call Heaven to witness,\" said she,\n\"that I will not eat until the man that is upon yonder bier shall eat\nlikewise.\"  \"Thou canst not fulfil that,\" said the Earl, \"yonder man\nis dead already.\"  \"I will prove that I can,\" said she.  Then he\noffered her a goblet of liquor.  \"Drink this goblet,\" he said, \"and\nit will cause thee to change thy mind.\"  \"Evil betide me,\" she\nanswered, \"if I drink aught until he drink also.\"  \"Truly,\" said the\nEarl, \"it is of no more avail for me to be gentle with thee than\nungentle.\"  And he gave her a box on the ear.  Thereupon she raised a\nloud and piercing shriek, and her lamentations were much greater than\nthey had been before, for she considered in her mind that had Geraint\nbeen alive, he durst not have struck her thus.  But, behold, at the\nsound of her cry, Geraint revived from his swoon, and he sat up on\nthe bier, and finding his sword in the hollow of his shield, he\nrushed to the place where the Earl was, and struck him a fiercely-\nwounding, severely-venomous, and sternly-smiting blow upon the crown\nof his head, so that he clove him in twain, until his sword was\nstayed by the table.  Then all left the board, and fled away.  And\nthis was not so much through fear of the living as through the dread\nthey felt at seeing the dead man rise up to slay them.  And Geraint\nlooked upon Enid, and he was grieved for two causes; one was, to see\nthat Enid had lost her colour and her wonted aspect, and the other,\nto know that she was in the right.  \"Lady,\" said he, \"knowest thou\nwhere our horses are?\"  \"I know, Lord, where thy horse is,\" she\nreplied, \"but I know not where is the other.  Thy horse is in the\nhouse yonder.\"  So he went to the house, and brought forth his horse,\nand mounted him, and took up Enid from the ground, and placed her\nupon the horse with him.  And he rode forward.  And their road lay\nbetween two hedges.  And the night was gaining on the day.  And lo!\nthey saw behind them the shafts of spears betwixt them and the sky,\nand they heard the trampling of horses, and the noise of a host\napproaching.  \"I hear something following us,\" said he, \"and I will\nput thee on the other side of the hedge.\"  And thus he did.  And\nthereupon, behold, a knight pricked towards him, and couched his\nlance.  When Enid saw this, she cried out, saying, \"Oh! chieftain,\nwhoever thou art, what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man?\"\n\"Oh! Heaven,\" said he, \"is it Geraint?\"  \"Yes, in truth,\" said she.\n\"And who art thou?\"  \"I am the Little King,\" he answered, \"coming to\nthy assistance, for I heard that thou wast in trouble.  And if thou\nhadst followed my advice, none of these hardships would have befallen\nthee.\"  \"Nothing can happen,\" said Geraint, \"without the will of\nHeaven, though much good results from counsel.\"  \"Yes,\" said the\nLittle King, \"and I know good counsel for thee now.  Come with me to\nthe court of a son-in-law of my sister, which is near here, and thou\nshalt have the best medical assistance in the kingdom.\"  \"I will do\nso gladly,\" said Geraint.  And Enid was placed upon the horse of one\nof the Little King's squires, and they went forward to the Baron's\npalace.  And they were received there with gladness, and they met\nwith hospitality and attention.  And the next morning they went to\nseek physicians; and it was not long before they came, and they\nattended Geraint until he was perfectly well.  And while Geraint was\nunder medical care, the Little King caused his armour to be repaired,\nuntil it was as good as it had ever been.  And they remained there a\nfortnight and a month.\n\nThen the Little King said to Geraint, \"Now will we go towards my own\nCourt, to take rest, and amuse ourselves.\"  \"Not so,\" said Geraint,\n\"we will first journey for one day more, and return again.\"  \"With\nall my heart,\" said the Little King, \"do thou go then.\"  And early in\nthe day they set forth.  And more gladly and more joyfully did Enid\njourney with them that day than she had ever done.  And they came to\nthe main road.  And when they reached a place where the road divided\nin two, they beheld a man on foot coming towards them along one of\nthese roads, and Gwiffert asked the man whence he came.  \"I come,\"\nsaid he, \"from an errand in the country.\"  \"Tell me,\" said Geraint,\n\"which is the best for me to follow of these two roads?\"  \"That is\nthe best for thee to follow,\" answered he, \"for if thou goest by this\none, thou wilt never return.  Below us,\" said he, \"there is a hedge\nof mist, and within it are enchanted games, and no one who has gone\nthere has ever returned.  And the Court of the Earl Owain is there,\nand he permits no one to go to lodge in the town, except he will go\nto his Court.\"  \"I declare to Heaven,\" said Geraint, \"that we will\ntake the lower road.\"  And they went along it until they came to the\ntown.  And they took the fairest and pleasantest place in the town\nfor their lodging.  And while they were thus, behold, a young man\ncame to them, and greeted them.  \"Heaven be propitious to thee,\" said\nthey.  \"Good Sirs,\" said he, \"what preparations are you making here?\"\n\"We are taking up our lodging,\" said they, \"to pass the night.\"  \"It\nis not the custom with him who owns the town,\" he answered, \"to\npermit any of gentle birth, unless they come to stay in his Court, to\nabide here; therefore, come ye to the Court.\"  \"We will come,\ngladly,\" said Geraint.  And they went with the page, and they were\njoyfully received.  And the Earl came to the hall to meet them, and\nhe commanded the tables to be laid.  And they washed, and sat down.\nAnd this is the order in which they sat:  Geraint on one side of the\nEarl, and Enid on the other side, and next to Enid the Little King,\nand then the Countess next to Geraint; and all after that as became\ntheir rank.  Then Geraint recollected the games, and thought that he\nshould not go to them; and on that account he did not eat.  Then the\nEarl looked upon Geraint, and considered, and he bethought him that\nhis not eating was because of the games, and it grieved him that he\nhad ever established those games, were it only on account of losing\nsuch a youth as Geraint.  And if Geraint had asked him to abolish the\ngames, he would gladly have done so.  Then the Earl said to Geraint,\n\"What thought occupies thy mind, that thou dost not eat?  If thou\nhesitatest about going to the games, thou shalt not go, and no other\nof thy rank shall ever go either.\"  \"Heaven reward thee,\" said\nGeraint, \"but I wish nothing better than to go to the games, and to\nbe shown the way thither.\"  \"If that is what thou dost prefer, thou\nshalt obtain it willingly.\"  \"I do prefer it, indeed,\" said he.  Then\nthey ate, and they were amply served, and they had a variety of\ngifts, and abundance of liquor.  And when they had finished eating\nthey arose.  And Geraint called for his horse and his armour, and he\naccoutred both himself and his horse.  And all the hosts went forth\nuntil they came to the side of the hedge, and the hedge was so lofty,\nthat it reached as high as they could see in the air, and upon every\nstake in the hedge, except two, there was the head of a man, and the\nnumber of stakes throughout the hedge was very great.  Then said the\nLittle King, \"May no one go in with the chieftain?\"  \"No one may,\"\nsaid Earl Owain.  \"Which way can I enter?\" inquired Geraint.  \"I know\nnot,\" said Owain, \"but enter by the way that thou wilt, and that\nseemeth easiest to thee.\"\n\nThen fearlessly and unhesitatingly Geraint dashed forward into the\nmist.  And on leaving the mist, he came to a large orchard; and in\nthe orchard he saw an open space, wherein was a tent of red satin;\nand the door of the tent was open, and an apple-tree stood in front\nof the door of the tent; and on a branch of the apple-tree hung a\nhuge hunting-horn.  Then he dismounted, and went into the tent; and\nthere was no one in the tent save one maiden sitting in a golden\nchair, and another chair was opposite to her, empty.  And Geraint\nwent to the empty chair, and sat down therein.  \"Ah! chieftain,\" said\nthe maiden, \"I would not counsel thee to sit in that chair.\"\n\"Wherefore?\" said Geraint.  \"The man to whom that chair belongs has\nnever suffered another to sit in it.\"  \"I care not,\" said Geraint,\n\"though it displease him that I sit in the chair.\"  And thereupon\nthey heard a mighty tumult around the tent.  And Geraint looked to\nsee what was the cause of the tumult.  And he beheld without a knight\nmounted upon a warhorse, proudly snorting, high-mettled, and large of\nbone; and a robe of honour in two parts was upon him and upon his\nhorse, and beneath it was plenty of armour.  \"Tell me, chieftain,\"\nsaid he to Geraint, \"who it was that bade thee sit there?\"  \"Myself,\"\nanswered he.  \"It was wrong of thee to do me this shame and disgrace.\nArise, and do me satisfaction for thine insolence.\"  Then Geraint\narose; and they encountered immediately; and they broke a set of\nlances, and a second set, and a third; and they gave each other\nfierce and frequent strokes; and at last Geraint became enraged, and\nhe urged on his horse, and rushed upon him, and gave him a thrust on\nthe centre of his shield, so that it was split, and so that the head\nof his lance went through his armour, and his girths were broken, and\nhe himself was borne headlong to the ground the length of Geraint's\nlance and arm, over his horse's crupper.  \"Oh, my Lord!\" said he,\n\"thy mercy, and thou shalt have what thou wilt.\"  \"I only desire,\"\nsaid Geraint, \"that this game shall no longer exist here, nor the\nhedge of mist, nor magic, nor enchantment.\"  \"Thou shalt have this\ngladly, Lord,\" he replied.  \"Cause, then, the mist to disappear from\nthis place,\" said Geraint.  \"Sound yonder horn,\" said he, \"and when\nthou soundest it, the mist will vanish; but it will not go hence\nunless the horn be blown by the knight by whom I am vanquished.\"  And\nsad and sorrowful was Enid where she remained, through anxiety\nconcerning Geraint.  Then Geraint went and sounded the horn.  And at\nthe first blast he gave, the mist vanished.  And all the hosts came\ntogether, and they all became reconciled to each other.  And the Earl\ninvited Geraint and the Little King to stay with him that night.  And\nthe next morning they separated.  And Geraint went towards his own\ndominions; and thenceforth he reigned prosperously, and his warlike\nfame and splendour lasted with renown and honour both to him and to\nEnid from that time forth.\n\n\n\nKILHWCH AND OLWEN\nOR THE\nTWRCH TRWYTH\n\n\n\nKilydd the son of Prince Kelyddon desired a wife as a helpmate, and\nthe wife that he chose was Goleuddydd, the daughter of Prince\nAnlawdd.  And after their union, the people put up prayers that they\nmight have an heir.  And they had a son through the prayers of the\npeople.  From the time of her pregnancy Goleuddydd became wild, and\nwandered about, without habitation; but when her delivery was at\nhand, her reason came back to her.  Then she went to a mountain where\nthere was a swineherd, keeping a herd of swine.  And through fear of\nthe swine the queen was delivered.  And the swineherd took the boy,\nand brought him to the palace; and he was christened, and they called\nhim Kilhwch, because he had been found in a swine's burrow.\nNevertheless the boy was of gentle lineage, and cousin unto Arthur;\nand they put him out to nurse.\n\nAfter this the boy's mother, Goleuddydd, the daughter of Prince\nAnlawdd, fell sick.  Then she called her husband unto her, and said\nto him, \"Of this sickness I shall die, and thou wilt take another\nwife.  Now wives are the gift of the Lord, but it would be wrong for\nthee to harm thy son.  Therefore I charge thee that thou take not a\nwife until thou see a briar with two blossoms upon my grave.\"  And\nthis he promised her.  Then she besought him to dress her grave every\nyear, that nothing might grow thereon.  So the queen died.  Now the\nking sent an attendant every morning to see if anything were growing\nupon the grave.  And at the end of the seventh year the master\nneglected that which he had promised to the queen.\n\nOne day the king went to hunt, and he rode to the place of burial to\nsee the grave, and to know if it were time that he should take a\nwife; and the king saw the briar.  And when he saw it, the king took\ncounsel where he should find a wife.  Said one of his counsellors, \"I\nknow a wife that will suit thee well, and she is the wife of King\nDoged.\"  And they resolved to go to seek her; and they slew the king,\nand brought away his wife and one daughter that she had along with\nher.  And they conquered the king's lands.\n\nOn a certain day, as the lady walked abroad, she came to the house of\nan old crone that dwelt in the town, and that had no tooth in her\nhead.  And the queen said to her, \"Old woman, tell me that which I\nshall ask thee, for the love of Heaven.  Where are the children of\nthe man who has carried me away by violence?\"  Said the crone, \"He\nhas not children.\"  Said the queen, \"Woe is me, that I should have\ncome to one who is childless!\"  Then said the hag, \"Thou needest not\nlament on account of that, for there is a prediction he shall have an\nheir by thee, and by none other.  Moreover, be not sorrowful, for he\nhas one son.\"\n\nThe lady returned home with joy; and she asked her consort,\n\"Wherefore hast thou concealed thy children from me?\"  The king said,\n\"I will do so no longer.\"  And he sent messengers for his son, and he\nwas brought to the Court.  His stepmother said unto him, \"It were\nwell for thee to have a wife, and I have a daughter who is sought of\nevery man of renown in the world.\"  \"I am not yet of an age to wed,\"\nanswered the youth.  Then said she unto him, \"I declare to thee, that\nit is thy destiny not to be suited with a wife until thou obtain\nOlwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.\"  And the youth blushed,\nand the love of the maiden diffused itself through all his frame,\nalthough he had never seen her.  And his father inquired of him,\n\"What has come over thee, my son, and what aileth thee?\"  \"My\nstepmother has declared to me that I shall never have a wife until I\nobtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.\"  \"That will be\neasy for thee,\" answered his father.  \"Arthur is thy cousin.  Go,\ntherefore, unto Arthur, to cut thy hair, and ask this of him as a\nboon.\"\n\nAnd the youth pricked forth upon a steed with head dappled grey, of\nfour winters old, firm of limb, with shell-formed hoofs, having a\nbridle of linked gold on his head, and upon him a saddle of costly\ngold.  And in the youth's hand were two spears of silver, sharp,\nwell-tempered, headed with steel, three ells in length, of an edge to\nwound the wind, and cause blood to flow, and swifter than the fall of\nthe dewdrop from the blade of reed-grass upon the earth when the dew\nof June is at the heaviest.  A gold-hilted sword was upon his thigh,\nthe blade of which was of gold, bearing a cross of inlaid gold of the\nhue of the lightning of heaven:  his war-horn was of ivory.  Before\nhim were two brindled white-breasted greyhounds, having strong\ncollars of rubies about their necks, reaching from the shoulder to\nthe ear.  And the one that was on the left side bounded across to the\nright side, and the one on the right to the left, and like two sea-\nswallows sported around him.  And his courser cast up four sods with\nhis four hoofs, like four swallows in the air, about his head, now\nabove, now below.  About him was a four-cornered cloth of purple, and\nan apple of gold was at each corner, and every one of the apples was\nof the value of an hundred kine.  And there was precious gold of the\nvalue of three hundred kine upon his shoes, and upon his stirrups,\nfrom his knee to the tip of his toe.  And the blade of grass bent not\nbeneath him, so light was his courser's tread as he journeyed towards\nthe gate of Arthur's Palace.\n\nSpoke the youth, \"Is there a porter?\"  \"There is; and if thou holdest\nnot thy peace, small will be thy welcome.  I am Arthur's porter every\nfirst day of January.  And during every other part of the year but\nthis, the office is filled by Huandaw, and Gogigwc, and Llaeskenym,\nand Pennpingyon, who goes upon his head to save his feet, neither\ntowards the sky nor towards the earth, but like a rolling stone upon\nthe floor of the court.\"  \"Open the portal.\"  \"I will not open it.\"\n\"Wherefore not?\"  \"The knife is in the meat, and the drink is in the\nhorn, and there is revelry in Arthur's Hall, and none may enter\ntherein but the son of a king of a privileged country, or a craftsman\nbringing his craft.  But there will be refreshment for thy dogs, and\nfor thy horses; and for thee there will be collops cooked and\npeppered, and luscious wine and mirthful songs, and food for fifty\nmen shall be brought unto thee in the guest chamber, where the\nstranger and the sons of other countries eat, who come not unto the\nprecincts of the Palace of Arthur.  Thou wilt fare no worse there\nthan thou wouldest with Arthur in the Court.  A lady shall smooth thy\ncouch, and shall lull thee with songs; and early to-morrow morning,\nwhen the gate is open for the multitude that come hither to-day, for\nthee shall it be opened first, and thou mayest sit in the place that\nthou shalt choose in Arthur's Hall, from the upper end to the lower.\"\nSaid the youth, \"That will I not do.  If thou openest the gate, it is\nwell.  If thou dost not open it, I will bring disgrace upon thy Lord,\nand evil report upon thee.  And I will set up three shouts at this\nvery gate, than which none were ever more deadly, from the top of\nPengwaed in Cornwall to the bottom of Dinsol, in the North, and to\nEsgair Oervel, in Ireland.  And all the women in this Palace that are\npregnant shall lose their offspring; and such as are not pregnant,\ntheir hearts shall be turned by illness, so that they shall never\nbear children from this day forward.\"  \"What clamour soever thou\nmayest make,\" said Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr, \"against the laws of Arthur's\nPalace shalt thou not enter therein, until I first go and speak with\nArthur.\"\n\nThen Glewlwyd went into the Hall.  And Arthur said to him, \"Hast thou\nnews from the gate?\"--\"Half of my life is past, and half of thine.  I\nwas heretofore in Kaer Se and Asse, in Sach and Salach, in Lotor and\nFotor; and I have been heretofore in India the Great and India the\nLesser; and I was in the battle of Dau Ynyr, when the twelve hostages\nwere brought from Llychlyn.  And I have also been in Europe, and in\nAfrica, and in the islands of Corsica, and in Caer Brythwch, and\nBrythach, and Verthach; and I was present when formerly thou didst\nslay the family of Clis the son of Merin, and when thou didst slay\nMil Du the son of Ducum, and when thou didst conquer Greece in the\nEast.  And I have been in Caer Oeth and Annoeth, and in Caer\nNevenhyr; nine supreme sovereigns, handsome men, saw we there, but\nnever did I behold a man of equal dignity with him who is now at the\ndoor of the portal.\"  Then said Arthur, \"If walking thou didst enter\nin here, return thou running.  And every one that beholds the light,\nand every one that opens and shuts the eye, let them shew him\nrespect, and serve him, some with gold-mounted drinking-horns, others\nwith collops cooked and peppered, until food and drink can be\nprepared for him.  It is unbecoming to keep such a man as thou sayest\nhe is, in the wind and the rain.\"  Said Kai, \"By the hand of my\nfriend, if thou wouldest follow my counsel, thou wouldest not break\nthrough the laws of the Court because of him.\"  \"Not so, blessed Kai.\nIt is an honour to us to be resorted to, and the greater our courtesy\nthe greater will be our renown, and our fame, and our glory.\"\n\nAnd Glewlwyd came to the gate, and opened the gate before him; and\nalthough all dismounted upon the horseblock at the gate, yet did he\nnot dismount, but rode in upon his charger.  Then said Kilhwch,\n\"Greeting be unto thee, Sovereign Ruler of this Island; and be this\ngreeting no less unto the lowest than unto the highest, and be it\nequally unto thy guests, and thy warriors, and thy chieftains--let\nall partake of it as completely as thyself.  And complete be thy\nfavour, and thy fame, and thy glory, throughout all this Island.\"\n\"Greeting unto thee also,\" said Arthur; \"sit thou between two of my\nwarriors, and thou shalt have minstrels before thee, and thou shalt\nenjoy the privileges of a king born to a throne, as long as thou\nremainest here.  And when I dispense my presents to the visitors and\nstrangers in this Court, they shall be in thy hand at my commencing.\"\nSaid the youth, \"I came not here to consume meat and drink; but if I\nobtain the boon that I seek, I will requite it thee, and extol thee;\nand if I have it not, I will bear forth thy dispraise to the four\nquarters of the world, as far as thy renown has extended.\"  Then said\nArthur, \"Since thou wilt not remain here, chieftain, thou shalt\nreceive the boon whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far as the wind\ndries, and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves, and the sea\nencircles, and the earth extends; save only my ship; and my mantle;\nand Caledvwlch, my sword; and Rhongomyant, my lance; and\nWynebgwrthucher, my shield; and Carnwenhau, my dagger; and\nGwenhwyvar, my wife.  By the truth of Heaven, thou shalt have it\ncheerfully, name what thou wilt.\"  \"I would that thou bless my hair.\"\n\"That shall be granted thee.\"\n\nAnd Arthur took a golden comb, and scissors, whereof the loops were\nof silver, and he combed his hair.  And Arthur inquired of him who he\nwas.  \"For my heart warms unto thee, and I know that thou art come of\nmy blood.  Tell me, therefore, who thou art.\"  \"I will tell thee,\"\nsaid the youth.  \"I am Kilhwch, the son of Kilydd, the son of Prince\nKelyddon, by Goleuddydd, my mother, the daughter of Prince Anlawdd.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Arthur; \"thou art my cousin.  Whatsoever boon\nthou mayest ask, thou shalt receive, be it what it may that thy\ntongue shall name.\"  \"Pledge the truth of Heaven and the faith of thy\nkingdom thereof.\"  \"I pledge it thee, gladly.\"  \"I crave of thee\nthen, that thou obtain for me Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden\nPenkawr; and this boon I likewise seek at the hands of thy warriors.\nI seek it from Kai, and Bedwyr, and Greidawl Galldonyd, and Gwythyr\nthe son of Greidawl, and Greid the son of Eri, and Kynddelig\nKyvarwydd, and Tathal Twyll Goleu, and Maelwys the son of Baeddan,\nand Crychwr the son of Nes, and Cubert the son of Daere, and Percos\nthe son of Poch, and Lluber Beuthach, and Corvil Bervach, and Gwynn\nthe son of Nudd, and Edeyrn the son of Nudd, and Gadwy the son of\nGeraint, and Prince Fflewddur Fflam, and Ruawn Pebyr the son of\nDorath, and Bradwen the son of Moren Mynawc, and Moren Mynawc\nhimself, and Dalldav the son of Kimin Cov, and the son of Alun Dyved,\nand the son of Saidi, and the son of Gwryon, and Uchtryd Ardywad Kad,\nand Kynwas Curvagyl, and Gwrhyr Gwarthegvras, and Isperyr Ewingath,\nand Gallcoyt Govynynat, and Duach, and Grathach, and Nerthach, the\nsons of Gwawrddur Kyrvach (these men came forth from the confines of\nhell), and Kilydd Canhastyr, and Canastyr Kanllaw, and Cors Cant-\nEwin, and Esgeir Gulhwch Govynkawn, and Drustwrn Hayarn, and Glewlwyd\nGavaelvawr, and Lloch Llawwynnyawc, and Aunwas Adeiniawc, and Sinnoch\nthe son of Seithved, and Gwennwynwyn the son of Naw, and Bedyw the\nson of Seithved, and Gobrwy the son of Echel Vorddwyttwll, and Echel\nVorddwyttwll himself, and Mael the son of Roycol, and Dadweir\nDallpenn, and Garwyli the son of Gwythawc Gwyr, and Gwythawc Gwyr\nhimself, and Gormant the son of Ricca, and Menw the son of\nTeirgwaedd, and Digon the son of Alar, and Selyf the son of Smoit,\nand Gusg the son of Atheu, and Nerth the son of Kedarn, and Drudwas\nthe son of Tryffin, and Twrch the son of Perif, and Twrch the son of\nAnnwas, and Iona king of France, and Sel the son of Selgi, and\nTeregud the son of Iaen, and Sulyen the son of Iaen, and Bradwen the\nson of Iaen, and Moren the son of Iaen, and Siawn the son of Iaen,\nand Cradawc the son of Iaen.

Hair had he upon\nhim like the hair of a stag).  And Sandde Bryd Angel (no one touched\nhim with a spear in the battle of Camlan because of his beauty; all\nthought he was a ministering angel).  And Kynwyl Sant (the third man\nthat escaped from the battle of Camlan, and he was the last who\nparted from Arthur on Hengroen his horse).  And Uchtryd the son of\nErim, and Eus the son of Erim, and Henwas Adeinawg the son of Erim,\nand Henbedestyr the son of Erim, and Sgilti Yscawndroed the son of\nErim. (Unto these three men belonged these three qualities,--With\nHenbedestyr there was not any one who could keep pace, either on\nhorseback or on foot; with Henwas Adeinawg, no four-footed beast\ncould run the distance of an acre, much less could it go beyond it;\nand as to Sgilti Yscawndroed, when he intended to go upon a message\nfor his Lord, he never sought to find a path, but knowing whither he\nwas to go, if his way lay through a wood he went along the tops of\nthe trees.  During his whole life, a blade of reed grass bent not\nbeneath his feet, much less did one ever break, so lightly did he\ntread.)  Teithi Hen the son of Gwynhan (his dominions were swallowed\nup by the sea, and he himself hardly escaped, and he came to Arthur;\nand his knife had this peculiarity, that from the time that he came\nthere no haft would ever remain upon it, and owing to this a sickness\ncame over him, and he pined away during the remainder of his life,\nand of this he died).  And Carneddyr the son of Govynyon Hen, and\nGwenwynwyn the son of Nav Gyssevin, Arthur's champion, and\nLlysgadrudd Emys, and Gwrbothu Hen (uncles unto Arthur were they, his\nmother's brothers).

Drem the son of Dremidyd (when the\ngnat arose in the morning with the sun, he could see it from Gelli\nWic in Cornwall, as far off as Pen Blathaon in North Britain).  And\nEidyol the son of Ner, and Glwyddyn Saer (who constructed Ehangwen,\nArthur's Hall).

Henwas, and Henwyneb (an old companion to\nArthur).  Gwallgoyc (another; when he came to a town, though there\nwere three hundred houses in it, if he wanted anything, he would not\nlet sleep come to the eyes of any one whilst he remained there).\nBerwyn the son of Gerenhir, and Paris king of France, and Osla\nGyllellvawr (who bore a short broad dagger.  When Arthur and his\nhosts came before a torrent, they would seek for a narrow place where\nthey might pass the water, and would lay the sheathed dagger across\nthe torrent, and it would form a bridge sufficient for the armies of\nthe three Islands of Britain, and of the three islands adjacent, with\ntheir spoil).  Gwyddawg the son of Menestyr (who slew Kai, and whom\nArthur slew, together with his brothers, to revenge Kai).  Garanwyn\nthe son of Kai, and Amren the son of Bedwyr, and Ely Amyr,and Rheu\nRhwyd Dyrys, and Rhun Rhudwern, and Eli, and Trachmyr (Arthur's chief\nhuntsmen).  And Llwyddeu the son of Kelcoed, and Hunabwy the son of\nGwryon, and Gwynn Godyvron, and Gweir Datharwenniddawg, and Gweir the\nson of Cadell the son of Talaryant, and Gweir Gwrhyd Ennwir, and\nGweir Paladyr Hir (the uncles of Arthur, the brothers of his mother).\nThe sons of Llwch Llawwynnyawg (from beyond the raging sea).\nLlenlleawg Wyddel, and Ardderchawg Prydain.  Cas the son of Saidi,\nGwrvan Gwallt Avwyn, and Gwyllennhin the king of France, and Gwittart\nthe son of Oedd king of Ireland.  Garselit Wyddel, Panawr Pen Bagad,\nand Ffleudor the son of Nav, Gwynnhyvar mayor of Cornwall and Devon\n(the ninth man that rallied the battle of Camlan).  Keli and Kueli,\nand Gilla Coes Hydd (he would clear three hundred acres at one bound:\nthe chief leaper of Ireland was he).  Sol, and Gwadyn Ossol, and\nGwadyn Odyeith.  (Sol could stand all day upon one foot.  Gwadyn\nOssol, if he stood upon the top of the highest mountain in the world,\nit would become a level plain under his feet.  Gwadyn Odyeith, the\nsoles of his feet emitted sparks of fire when they struck upon things\nhard, like the heated mass when drawn out of the forge.  He cleared\nthe way for Arthur when he came to any stoppage.)  Hirerwm and\nHiratrwm.  (The day they went on a visit three Cantrevs provided for\ntheir entertainment, and they feasted until noon and drank until\nnight, when they went to sleep.  And then they devoured the heads of\nthe vermin through hunger, as if they had never eaten anything.  When\nthey made a visit they left neither the fat nor the lean, neither the\nhot nor the cold, the sour nor the sweet, the fresh nor the salt, the\nboiled nor the raw.)  Huarwar the son of Aflawn (who asked Arthur\nsuch a boon as would satisfy him.  It was the third great plague of\nCornwall when he received it.  None could get a smile from him but\nwhen he was satisfied).  Gware Gwallt Euryn.  The two cubs of Gast\nRhymi, Gwyddrud and Gwyddneu Astrus.  Sugyn the son of Sugnedydd (who\nwould suck up the sea on which were three hundred ships so as to\nleave nothing but a dry strand.  He was broad-chested).  Rhacymwri,\nthe attendant of Arthur (whatever barn he was shown, were there the\nproduce of thirty ploughs within it, he would strike it with an iron\nflail until the rafters, the beams, and the boards were no better\nthan the small oats in the mow upon the floor of the barn).\nDygyflwng and Anoeth Veidawg.  And Hir Eiddyl, and Hir Amreu (they\nwere two attendants of Arthur).  And Gwevyl the son of Gwestad (on\nthe day that he was sad, he would let one of his lips drop below his\nwaist, while he turned up the other like a cap upon his head).\nUchtryd Varyf Draws (who spread his red untrimmed beard over the\neight-and-forty rafters which were in Arthur's Hall).  Elidyr\nGyvarwydd.  Yskyrdav and Yscudydd (two attendants of Gwenhwyvar were\nthey.  Their feet were swift as their thoughts when bearing a\nmessage).  Brys the son of Bryssethach (from the Hill of the Black\nFernbrake in North Britain).  And Grudlwyn Gorr.  Bwlch, and Kyfwlch,\nand Sefwlch, the sons of Cleddyf Kyfwlch, the grandsons of Cleddyf\nDifwlch.  (Their three shields were three gleaming glitterers; their\nthree spears were three pointed piercers; their three swords were\nthree grinding gashers; Glas, Glessic, and Gleisad.  Their three\ndogs, Call, Cuall, and Cavall.  Their three horses, Hwyrdyddwd, and\nDrwgdyddwd, and Llwyrdyddwg.  Their three wives, Och, and Garym, and\nDiaspad.  Their three grandchildren, Lluched, and Neved, and\nEissiwed.  Their three daughters, Drwg, and Gwaeth, and Gwaethav Oll.\nTheir three hand-maids, Eheubryd the daughter of Kyfwlch, Gorascwrn\nthe daughter of Nerth, Ewaedan the daughter of Kynvelyn Keudawd Pwyll\nthe half-man.)  Dwnn Diessic Unbenn, Eiladyr the son of Pen Llarcau,\nKynedyr Wyllt the son of Hettwn Talaryant, Sawyl Ben Uchel, Gwalchmai\nthe son of Gwyar, Gwalhaved the son of Gwyar, Gwrhyr Gwastawd\nIeithoedd (to whom all tongues were known), and Kethcrwm the Priest.\nClust the son of Clustveinad (though he were buried seven cubits\nbeneath the earth, he would hear the ant fifty miles off rise from\nher nest in the morning).  Medyr the son of Methredydd (from Gelli\nWic he could, in a twinkling, shoot the wren through the two legs\nupon Esgeir Oervel in Ireland).  Gwiawn Llygad Cath (who could cut a\nhaw from the eye of the gnat without hurting him).  Ol the son of\nOlwydd (seven years before he was born his father's swine were\ncarried off, and when he grew up a man he tracked the swine, and\nbrought them back in seven herds).  Bedwini the Bishop (who blessed\nArthur's meat and drink).  For the sake of the golden-chained\ndaughters of this island.  For the sake of Gwenhwyvar its chief lady,\nand Gwennhwyach her sister, and Rathtyeu the only daughter of\nClemenhill, and Rhelemon the daughter of Kai, and Tannwen the\ndaughter of Gweir Datharweniddawg.  Gwenn Alarch the daughter of\nKynwyl Canbwch.  Eurneid the daughter of Clydno Eiddin.  Eneuawc the\ndaughter of Bedwyr.  Enrydreg the daughter of Tudvathar.  Gwennwledyr\nthe daughter of Gwaledyr Kyrvach.  Erddudnid the daughter of Tryffin.\nEurolwen the daughter of Gwdolwyn Gorr.  Teleri the daughter of Peul.\nIndeg the daughter of Garwy Hir.  Morvudd the daughter of Urien\nRheged.  Gwenllian Deg the majestic maiden.  Creiddylad the daughter\nof Lludd Llaw Ereint.  (She was the most splendid maiden in the three\nIslands of the mighty, and in the three Islands adjacent, and for her\nGwythyr the son of Greidawl and Gwynn the son of Nudd fight every\nfirst of May until the day of doom.)  Ellylw the daughter of Neol\nKynn-Crog (she lived three ages).  Essyllt Vinwen and Essyllt\nVingul.\"  And all these did Kilhwch the son of Kilydd adjure to\nobtain his boon.\n\nThen said Arthur, \"Oh! chieftain, I have never heard of the maiden of\nwhom thou speakest, nor of her kindred, but I will gladly send\nmessengers in search of her.  Give me time to seek her.\"  And the\nyouth said, \"I will willingly grant from this night to that at the\nend of the year to do so.\"  Then Arthur sent messengers to every land\nwithin his dominions to seek for the maiden; and at the end of the\nyear Arthur's messengers returned without having gained any knowledge\nor intelligence concerning Olwen more than on the first day.  Then\nsaid Kilhwch, \"Every one has received his boon, and I yet lack mine.\nI will depart and bear away thy honour with me.\"  Then said Kai,\n\"Rash chieftain! dost thou reproach Arthur?  Go with us, and we will\nnot part until thou dost either confess that the maiden exists not in\nthe world, or until we obtain her.\"  Thereupon Kai rose up.  Kai had\nthis peculiarity, that his breath lasted nine nights and nine days\nunder water, and he could exist nine nights and nine days without\nsleep.  A wound from Kai's sword no physician could heal.  Very\nsubtle was Kai.  When it pleased him he could render himself as tall\nas the highest tree in the forest.  And he had another peculiarity,--\nso great was the heat of his nature, that, when it rained hardest,\nwhatever he carried remained dry for a handbreadth above and a\nhandbreadth below his hand; and when his companions were coldest, it\nwas to them as fuel with which to light their fire.\n\nAnd Arthur called Bedwyr, who never shrank from any enterprise upon\nwhich Kai was bound.  None was equal to him in swiftness throughout\nthis island except Arthur and Drych Ail Kibddar.  And although he was\none-handed, three warriors could not shed blood faster than he on the\nfield of battle.  Another property he had; his lance would produce a\nwound equal to those of nine opposing lances.\n\nAnd Arthur called to Kynddelig the Guide, \"Go thou upon this\nexpedition with the chieftain.\"  For as good a guide was he in a land\nwhich he had never seen as he was in his own.\n\nHe called Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, because he knew all tongues.\n\nHe called Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, because he never returned home\nwithout achieving the adventure of which he went in quest.  He was\nthe best of footmen and the best of knights.  He was nephew to\nArthur, the son of his sister, and his cousin.\n\nAnd Arthur called Menw the son of Teirgwaedd, in order that if they\nwent into a savage country, he might cast a charm and an illusion\nover them, so that none might see them whilst they could see every\none.\n\nThey journeyed until they came to a vast open plain, wherein they saw\na great castle, which was the fairest of the castles of the world.\nAnd they journeyed that day until the evening, and when they thought\nthey were nigh to the castle, they were no nearer to it than they had\nbeen in the morning.  And the second and the third day they\njourneyed, and even then scarcely could they reach so far.  And when\nthey came before the castle, they beheld a vast flock of sheep, which\nwas boundless and without an end.  And upon the top of a mound there\nwas a herdsman, keeping the sheep.  And a rug made of skins was upon\nhim; and by his side was a shaggy mastiff, larger than a steed nine\nwinters old.  Never had he lost even a lamb from his flock, much less\na large sheep.  He let no occasion ever pass without doing some hurt\nand harm.  All the dead trees and bushes in the plain he burnt with\nhis breath down to the very ground.\n\nThen said Kai, \"Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, go thou and salute yonder\nman.\"  \"Kai,\" said he, \"I engaged not to go further than thou\nthyself.\"  \"Let us go then together,\" answered Kai.  Said Menw the\nson of Teirgwaedd, \"Fear not to go thither, for I will cast a spell\nupon the dog, so that he shall injure no one.\"  And they went up to\nthe mound whereon the herdsman was, and they said to him, \"How dost\nthou fare, O herdsman?\"  \"No less fair be it to you than to me.\"\n\"Truly, art thou the chief?\"  \"There is no hurt to injure me but my\nown.\" {5}  \"Whose are the sheep that thou dost keep, and to whom does\nyonder castle belong?\"  \"Stupid are ye, truly!  Through the whole\nworld is it known that this is the castle of Yspaddaden Penkawr.\"\n\"And who art thou?\"  \"I am called Custennin the son of Dyfnedig, and\nmy brother Yspaddaden Penkawr oppressed me because of my possessions.\nAnd ye also, who are ye?\"  \"We are an embassy from Arthur, come to\nseek Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.\"  \"Oh men! the mercy\nof Heaven be upon you, do not that for all the world.  None who ever\ncame hither on this quest has returned alive.\"  And the herdsman rose\nup.  And as he arose, Kilhwch gave unto him a ring of gold.  And he\nsought to put on the ring, but it was too small for him, so he placed\nit in the finger of his glove.  And he went home, and gave the glove\nto his spouse to keep.  And she took the ring from the glove when it\nwas given her, and she said, \"Whence came this ring, for thou art not\nwont to have good fortune?\"  \"I went,\" said he, \"to the sea to seek\nfor fish, and lo, I saw a corpse borne by the waves.  And a fairer\ncorpse than it did I never behold.  And from its finger did I take\nthis ring.\"  \"O man! does the sea permit its dead to wear jewels?\nShow me then this body.\"  \"Oh wife, him to whom this ring belonged\nthou shalt see here in the evening.\"  \"And who is he?\" asked the\nwoman, \"Kilhwch the son of Kilydd, the son of Prince Kelyddon, by\nGoleuddydd the daughter of Prince Anlawdd, his mother, who is come to\nseek Olwen as his wife.\"  And when she heard that, her feelings were\ndivided between the joy that she had that her nephew, the son of her\nsister, was coming to her, and sorrow because she had never known any\none depart alive who had come on that quest.\n\nAnd they went forward to the gate of Custennin the herdsman's\ndwelling.  And when she heard their footsteps approaching, she ran\nout with joy to meet them.  And Kai snatched a billet out of the\npile.  And when she met them she sought to throw her arms about their\nnecks.  And Kai placed the log between her two hands, and she\nsqueezed it so that it became a twisted coil.  \"Oh woman,\" said Kai,\n\"if thou hadst squeezed me thus, none could ever again have set their\naffections on me.  Evil love were this.\"  They entered into the\nhouse, and were served; and soon after they all went forth to amuse\nthemselves.  Then the woman opened a stone chest that was before the\nchimney-corner, and out of it arose a youth with yellow curling hair.\nSaid Gwrhyr, \"It is a pity to hide this youth.  I know that it is not\nhis own crime that is thus visited upon him.\"  \"This is but a\nremnant,\" said the woman.  \"Three-and-twenty of my sons has\nYspaddaden Penkawr slain, and I have no more hope of this one than of\nthe others.\"  Then said Kai, \"Let him come and be a companion with\nme, and he shall not be slain unless I also am slain with him.\"  And\nthey ate.  And the woman asked them, \"Upon what errand come you\nhere?\"  \"We come to seek Olwen for this youth.\"  Then said the woman,\n\"In the name of Heaven, since no one from the castle hath yet seen\nyou, return again whence you came.\"  \"Heaven is our witness, that we\nwill not return until we have seen the maiden.\"  Said Kai, \"Does she\never come hither, so that she may be seen?\"  \"She comes here every\nSaturday to wash her head, and in the vessel where she washes, she\nleaves all her rings, and she never either comes herself or sends any\nmessengers to fetch them.\"\n\n\"Will she come here if she is sent to?\"  \"Heaven knows that I will\nnot destroy my soul, nor will I betray those that trust me; unless\nyou will pledge me your faith that you will not harm her, I will not\nsend to her.\"  \"We pledge it,\" said they.  So a message was sent, and\nshe came.\n\nThe maiden was clothed in a robe of flame-coloured silk, and about\nher neck was a collar of ruddy gold, on which were precious emeralds\nand rubies.  More yellow was her head than the flower of the broom,\nand her skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were\nher hands and her fingers than the blossoms of the wood anemone\namidst the spray of the meadow fountain.  The eye of the trained\nhawk, the glance of the three-mewed falcon was not brighter than\nhers.  Her bosom was more snowy than the breast of the white swan,\nher cheek was redder than the reddest roses.  Whoso beheld her was\nfilled with her love.  Four white trefoils sprung up wherever she\ntrod.  And therefore was she called Olwen.\n\nShe entered the house, and sat beside Kilhwch upon the foremost\nbench; and as soon as he saw her he knew her.  And Kilhwch said unto\nher, \"Ah! maiden, thou art she whom I have loved; come away with me,\nlest they speak evil of thee and of me.  Many a day have I loved\nthee.\"  \"I cannot do this, for I have pledged my faith to my father\nnot to go without his counsel, for his life will last only until the\ntime of my espousals.  Whatever is, must be.  But I will give thee\nadvice if thou wilt take it.  Go, ask me of my father, and that which\nhe shall require of thee, grant it, and thou wilt obtain me; but if\nthou deny him anything, thou wilt not obtain me, and it will be well\nfor thee if thou escape with thy life.\"  \"I promise all this, if\noccasion offer,\" said he.\n\nShe returned to her chamber, and they all rose up and followed her to\nthe castle.  And they slew the nine porters that were at the nine\ngates in silence.  And they slew the nine watch-dogs without one of\nthem barking.  And they went forward to the hall.\n\n\"The greeting of Heaven and of man be unto thee, Yspaddaden Penkawr,\"\nsaid they.  \"And you, wherefore come you?\"  \"We come to ask thy\ndaughter Olwen, for Kilhwch the son of Kilydd, the son of Prince\nKelyddon.\"  \"Where are my pages and my servants?  Raise up the forks\nbeneath my two eyebrows which have fallen over my eyes, that I may\nsee the fashion of my son-in-law.\"  And they did so.  \"Come hither\nto-morrow, and you shall have an answer.\"\n\nThey rose to go forth, and Yspaddaden Penkawr seized one of the three\npoisoned darts that lay beside him, and threw it after them.  And\nBedwyr caught it, and flung it, and pierced Yspaddaden Penkawr\ngrievously with it through the knee.  Then he said, \"A cursed\nungentle son-in-law, truly.  I shall ever walk the worse for his\nrudeness, and shall ever be without a cure.  This poisoned iron pains\nme like the bite of a gadfly.  Cursed be the smith who forged it, and\nthe anvil whereon it was wrought!  So sharp is it!\"\n\nThat night also they took up their abode in the house of Custennin\nthe herdsman.  The next day with the dawn they arrayed themselves in\nhaste and proceeded to the castle, and entered the hall, and they\nsaid, \"Yspaddaden Penkawr, give us thy daughter in consideration of\nher dower and her maiden fee, which we will pay to thee and to her\ntwo kinswomen likewise.  And unless thou wilt do so, thou shalt meet\nwith thy death on her account.\"  Then he said, \"Her four great-\ngrandmothers, and her four great-grandsires are yet alive, it is\nneedful that I take counsel of them.\"  \"Be it so,\" answered they, \"we\nwill go to meat.\"  As they rose up, he took the second dart that was\nbeside him, and cast it after them.  And Menw the son of Gwaedd\ncaught it, and flung it back at him, and wounded him in the centre of\nthe breast, so that it came out at the small of his back.  \"A cursed\nungentle son-in-law, truly,\" said he, \"the hard iron pains me like\nthe bite of a horse-leech.  Cursed be the hearth whereon it was\nheated, and the smith who formed it!  So sharp is it!  Henceforth,\nwhenever I go up a hill, I shall have a scant in my breath, and a\npain in my chest, and I shall often loathe my food.\"  And they went\nto meat.\n\nAnd the third day they returned to the palace.  And Yspaddaden\nPenkawr said to them, \"Shoot not at me again unless you desire death.\nWhere are my attendants?  Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have\nfallen over my eyeballs, that I may see the fashion of my son-in-\nlaw.\"  Then they arose, and, as they did so, Yspaddaden Penkawr took\nthe third poisoned dart and cast it at them.  And Kilhwch caught it\nand threw it vigorously, and wounded him through the eyeball, so that\nthe dart came out at the back of his head.  \"A cursed ungentle son-\nin-law, truly!  As long as I remain alive, my eyesight will be the\nworse.  Whenever I go against the wind, my eyes will water; and\nperadventure my head will burn, and I shall have a giddiness every\nnew moon.  Cursed be the fire in which it was forged.  Like the bite\nof a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.\"  And they went to\nmeat.\n\nAnd the next day they came again to the palace, and they said, \"Shoot\nnot at us any more, unless thou desirest such hurt, and harm, and\ntorture as thou now hast, and even more.\"  \"Give me thy daughter, and\nif thou wilt not give her, thou shalt receive thy death because of\nher.\"  \"Where is he that seeks my daughter?  Come hither where I may\nsee thee.\"  And they placed him a chair face to face with him.\n\nSaid Yspaddaden Penkawr, \"Is it thou that seekest my daughter?\"  \"It\nis I,\" answered Kilhwch.  \"I must have thy pledge that thou wilt not\ndo towards me otherwise than is just, and when I have gotten that\nwhich I shall name, my daughter thou shalt have.\"  \"I promise thee\nthat willingly,\" said Kilhwch, \"name what thou wilt.\"  \"I will do\nso,\" said he.\n\n\"Seest thou yonder vast hill?\"  \"I see it.\"  \"I require that it be\nrooted up, and that the grubbings be burned for manure on the face of\nthe land, and that it be ploughed and sown in one day, and in one day\nthat the grain ripen.  And of that wheat I intend to make food and\nliquor fit for the wedding of thee and my daughter.  And all this I\nrequire done in one day.\"\n\n\"It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think\nthat it will not be easy.\"\n\n\"Though this be easy for thee, there is yet that which will not be\nso.  No husbandman can till or prepare this land, so wild is it,\nexcept Amaethon the son of Don, and he will not come with thee by his\nown free will, and thou wilt not be able to compel him.\"\n\n\"It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think\nthat it will not be easy.\"\n\n\"Though thou get this, there is yet that which thou wilt not get.\nGovannon the son of Don to come to the headland to rid the iron, he\nwill do no work of his own good will except for a lawful king, and\nthou wilt not be able to compel him.\"\n\n\"It will be easy for me to compass this.\"\n\n\"Though thou get this, there is yet that which thou wilt not get; the\ntwo dun oxen of Gwlwlyd, both yoked together, to plough the wild land\nyonder stoutly.

There is a party at the door of the gate\nwho desire to come in.\"  \"Didst thou inquire of them if they\npossessed any art?\"  \"I did inquire,\" said he, \"and one told me that\nhe was well skilled in the burnishing of swords.\"  \"We have need of\nhim then.  For some time have I sought for some one to polish my\nsword, and could find no one.  Let this man enter, since he brings\nwith him his craft.\"  The porter thereupon returned and opened the\ngate.  And Kai went in by himself, and he saluted Gwrnach the Giant.\nAnd a chair was placed for him opposite to Gwrnach.  And Gwrnach said\nto him, \"Oh man! is it true that is reported of thee, that thou\nknowest how to burnish swords?\"  \"I know full well how to do so,\"\nanswered Kai.  Then was the sword of Gwrnach brought to him.  And Kai\ntook a blue whetstone from under his arm, and asked him whether he\nwould have it burnished white or blue.  \"Do with it as it seems good\nto thee, and as thou wouldest if it were thine own.\"  Then Kai\npolished one half of the blade and put it in his hand.  \"Will this\nplease thee?\" asked he.  \"I would rather than all that is in my\ndominions that the whole of it were like unto this.  It is a marvel\nto me that such a man as thou should be without a companion.\"  \"Oh!\nnoble sir, I have a companion, albeit he is not skilled in this art.\"\n\"Who may he be?\"  \"Let the porter go forth, and I will tell him\nwhereby he may know him.  The head of his lance will leave its shaft,\nand draw blood from the wind, and will descend upon its shaft again.\"\nThen the gate was opened, and Bedwyr entered.  And Kai said, \"Bedwyr\nis very skilful, although he knows not this art.\"\n\nAnd there was much discourse among those who were without, because\nthat Kai and Bedwyr had gone in.  And a young man who was with them,\nthe only son of Custennin the herdsman, got in also.  And he caused\nall his companions to keep close to him as he passed the three wards,\nand until he came into the midst of the castle.  And his companions\nsaid unto the son of Custennin, \"Thou hast done this!  Thou art the\nbest of all men.\"  And thenceforth he was called Goreu, the son of\nCustennin.  Then they dispersed to their lodgings, that they might\nslay those who lodged therein, unknown to the Giant.\n\nThe sword was now polished, and Kai gave it unto the hand of Gwrnach\nthe Giant, to see if he were pleased with his work.  And the Giant\nsaid, \"The work is good, I am content therewith.\"  Said Kai, \"It is\nthy scabbard that hath rusted thy sword, give it to me that I may\ntake out the wooden sides of it and put in new ones.\"  And he took\nthe scabbard from him, and the sword in the other hand.  And he came\nand stood over against the Giant, as if he would have put the sword\ninto the scabbard; and with it he struck at the head of the Giant,\nand cut off his head at one blow.  Then they despoiled the castle,\nand took from it what goods and jewels they would.  And again on the\nsame day, at the beginning of the year, they came to Arthur's Court,\nbearing with them the sword of Gwrnach the Giant.\n\nNow, when they told Arthur how they had sped, Arthur said, \"Which of\nthese marvels will it be best for us to seek first?\"  \"It will be\nbest,\" said they, \"to seek Mabon the son of Modron; and he will not\nbe found unless we first find Eidoel the son of Aer, his kinsman.\"\nThen Arthur rose up, and the warriors of the Islands of Britain with\nhim, to seek for Eidoel; and they proceeded until they came before\nthe Castle of Glivi, where Eidoel was imprisoned.  Glivi stood on the\nsummit of his castle, and he said, \"Arthur, what requirest thou of\nme, since nothing remains to me in this fortress, and I have neither\njoy nor pleasure in it; neither wheat nor oats?  Seek not therefore\nto do me harm.\"  Said Arthur, \"Not to injure thee came I hither, but\nto seek for the prisoner that is with thee.\"  \"I will give thee my\nprisoner, though I had not thought to give him up to any one; and\ntherewith shalt thou have my support and my aid.\"\n\nHis followers said unto Arthur, \"Lord, go thou home, thou canst not\nproceed with thy host in quest of such small adventures as these.\"\nThen said Arthur, \"It were well for thee, Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd,\nto go upon this quest, for thou knowest all languages, and art\nfamiliar with those of the birds and the beasts.  Thou, Eidoel,\noughtest likewise to go with my men in search of thy cousin.  And as\nfor you, Kai and Bedwyr, I have hope of whatever adventure ye are in\nquest of, that ye will achieve it.  Achieve ye this adventure for\nme.\"\n\nThey went forward until they came to the Ousel of Cilgwri.  And\nGwrhyr adjured her for the sake of Heaven, saying, \"Tell me if thou\nknowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken when three\nnights old from between his mother and the wall.\"  And the Ousel\nanswered, \"When I first came here, there was a smith's anvil in this\nplace, and I was then a young bird; and from that time no work has\nbeen done upon it, save the pecking of my beak every evening, and now\nthere is not so much as the size of a nut remaining thereof; yet the\nvengeance of Heaven be upon me, if during all that time I have ever\nheard of the man for whom you inquire.  Nevertheless I will do that\nwhich is right, and that which it is fitting that I should do for an\nembassy from Arthur.  There is a race of animals who were formed\nbefore me, and I will be your guide to them.\"\n\nSo they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of Redynvre.  \"Stag\nof Redynvre, behold we are come to thee, an embassy from Arthur, for\nwe have not heard of any animal older than thou.  Say, knowest thou\naught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken from his mother when\nthree nights old?\"  The Stag said, \"When first I came hither, there\nwas a plain all around me, without any trees save one oak sapling,\nwhich grew up to be an oak with an hundred branches.  And that oak\nhas since perished, so that now nothing remains of it but the\nwithered stump; and from that day to this I have been here, yet have\nI never heard of the man for whom you inquire.  Nevertheless, being\nan embassy from Arthur, I will be your guide to the place where there\nis an animal which was formed before I was.\"\n\nSo they proceeded to the place where was the Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd.\n\"Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd, here is an embassy from Arthur; knowest thou\naught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken after three nights\nfrom his mother?\"  \"If I knew I would tell you.  When first I came\nhither, the wide valley you see was a wooded glen.  And a race of men\ncame and rooted it up.  And there grew there a second wood; and this\nwood is the third.  My wings, are they not withered stumps?  Yet all\nthis time, even until to-day, I have never heard of the man for whom\nyou inquire.  Nevertheless, I will be the guide of Arthur's embassy\nuntil you come to the place where is the oldest animal in this world,\nand the one that has travelled most, the Eagle of Gwern Abwy.\"\n\nGwrhyr said, \"Eagle of Gwern Abwy, we have come to thee an embassy\nfrom Arthur, to ask thee if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of\nModron, who was taken from his mother when he was three nights old.\"\nThe Eagle said, \"I have been here for a great space of time, and when\nI first came hither there was a rock here, from the top of which I\npecked at the stars every evening; and now it is not so much as a\nspan high.  From that day to this I have been here, and I have never\nheard of the man for whom you inquire, except once when I went in\nsearch of food as far as Llyn Llyw.  And when I came there, I struck\nmy talons into a salmon, thinking he would serve me as food for a\nlong time.  But he drew me into the deep, and I was scarcely able to\nescape from him.  After that I went with my whole kindred to attack\nhim, and to try to destroy him, but he sent messengers, and made\npeace with me; and came and besought me to take fifty fish spears out\nof his back.  Unless he know something of him whom you seek, I cannot\ntell who may.  However, I will guide you to the place where he is.\"\n\nSo they went thither; and the Eagle said, \"Salmon of Llyn Llyw, I\nhave come to thee with an embassy from Arthur, to ask thee if thou\nknowest aught concerning Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken away\nat three nights old from his mother.\"  \"As much as I know I will tell\nthee.  With every tide I go along the river upwards, until I come\nnear to the walls of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as\nI never found elsewhere; and to the end that ye may give credence\nthereto, let one of you go thither upon each of my two shoulders.\"\nSo Kai and Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd went upon the two shoulders of\nthe salmon, and they proceeded until they came unto the wall of the\nprison, and they heard a great wailing and lamenting from the\ndungeon.  Said Gwrhyr, \"Who is it that laments in this house of\nstone?\"  \"Alas, there is reason enough for whoever is here to lament.\nIt is Mabon the son of Modron who is here imprisoned; and no\nimprisonment was ever so grievous as mine, neither that of Llud Llaw\nEreint, nor that of Greid the son of Eri.\"  \"Hast thou hope of being\nreleased for gold or for silver, or for any gifts of wealth, or\nthrough battle and fighting?\"  \"By fighting will whatever I may gain\nbe obtained.\"\n\nThen they went thence, and returned to Arthur, and they told him\nwhere Mabon the son of Modron was imprisoned.  And Arthur summoned\nthe warriors of the Island, and they journeyed as far as Gloucester,\nto the place where Mabon was in prison.  Kai and Bedwyr went upon the\nshoulders of the fish, whilst the warriors of Arthur attacked the\ncastle.  And Kai broke through the wall into the dungeon, and brought\naway the prisoner upon his back, whilst the fight was going on\nbetween the warriors.  And Arthur returned home, and Mabon with him\nat liberty.\n\n\nSaid Arthur, \"Which of the marvels will it be best for us now to seek\nfirst?\"  \"It will be best to seek for the two cubs of Gast Rhymhi.\"\n\"Is it known,\" asked Arthur, \"where she is?\"  \"She is in Aber Deu\nCleddyf,\" said one.  Then Arthur went to the house of Tringad, in\nAber Cleddyf, and he inquired of him whether he had heard of her\nthere.  \"In what form may she be?\"  \"She is in the form of a she-\nwolf,\" said he; \"and with her there are two cubs.\"  \"She has often\nslain my herds, and she is there below in a cave in Aber Cleddyf.\"\n\nSo Arthur went in his ship Prydwen by sea, and the others went by\nland, to hunt her.  And they surrounded her and her two cubs, and God\ndid change them again for Arthur into their own form.  And the host\nof Arthur dispersed themselves into parties of one and two.\n\n\nOn a certain day, as Gwythyr the son of Greidawl was walking over a\nmountain, he heard a wailing and a grievous cry.  And when he heard\nit, he sprang forward, and went towards it.  And when he came there,\nhe drew his sword, and smote off an ant-hill close to the earth,\nwhereby it escaped being burned in the fire.  And the ants said to\nhim, \"Receive from us the blessing of Heaven, and that which no man\ncan give we will give thee.\"  Then they fetched the nine bushels of\nflax-seed which Yspaddaden Penkawr had required of Kilhwch, and they\nbrought the full measure without lacking any, except one flax-seed,\nand that the lame pismire brought in before night.\n\n\nAs Kai and Bedwyr sat on a beacon carn on the summit of Plinlimmon,\nin the highest wind that ever was in the world, they looked around\nthem, and saw a great smoke towards the south, afar off, which did\nnot bend with the wind.  Then said Kai, \"By the hand of my friend,\nbehold, yonder is the fire of a robber!\"  Then they hastened towards\nthe smoke, and they came so near to it, that they could see Dillus\nVarvawc scorching a wild boar.  \"Behold, yonder is the greatest\nrobber that ever fled from Arthur,\" said Bedwyr unto Kai.  \"Dost thou\nknow him?\"  \"I do know him,\" answered Kai, \"he is Dillus Varvawc, and\nno leash in the world will be able to hold Drudwyn, the cub of Greid\nthe son of Eri, save a leash made from the beard of him thou seest\nyonder.  And even that will be useless, unless his beard be plucked\nalive with wooden tweezers; for if dead, it will be brittle.\"  \"What\nthinkest thou that we should do concerning this?\" said Bedwyr.  \"Let\nus suffer him,\" said Kai, \"to eat as much as he will of the meat, and\nafter that he will fall asleep.\"  And during that time they employed\nthemselves in making the wooden tweezers.  And when Kai knew\ncertainly that he was asleep, he made a pit under his feet, the\nlargest in the world, and he struck him a violent blow, and squeezed\nhim into the pit.  And there they twitched out his beard completely\nwith the wooden tweezers; and after that they slew him altogether.\n\nAnd from thence they both went to Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, and took\nthe leash made of Dillus Varvawc's beard with them, and they gave it\ninto Arthur's hand.  Then Arthur composed this Englyn -\n\n\nKai made a leash\nOf Dillus son of Eurei's beard.\nWere he alive, thy death he'd be.\n\n\nAnd thereupon Kai was wroth, so that the warriors of the Island could\nscarcely make peace between Kai and Arthur.  And thenceforth, neither\nin Arthur's troubles, nor for the slaying of his men, would Kai come\nforward to his aid for ever after.\n\n\nSaid Arthur, \"Which of the marvels is it best for us now to seek?\"\n\"It is best for us to seek Drudwyn, the cub of Greid the son of Eri.\"\n\nA little while before this, Creiddylad the daughter of Lludd Llaw\nEreint, and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl, were betrothed.  And before\nshe had become his bride, Gwyn ap Nudd came and carried her away by\nforce; and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl gathered his host together,\nand went to fight with Gwyn ap Nudd.  But Gwyn overcame him, and\ncaptured Greid the son of Eri, and Glinneu the son of Taran, and\nGwrgwst Ledlwm, and Dynvarth his son.  And he captured Penn the son\nof Nethawg, and Nwython, and Kyledyr Wyllt his son.  And they slew\nNwython, and took out his heart, and constrained Kyledyr to eat the\nheart of his father.  And therefrom Kyledyr became mad.  When Arthur\nheard of this, he went to the North, and summoned Gwyn ap Nudd before\nhim, and set free the nobles whom he had put in prison, and made\npeace between Gwyn ap Nudd and Gwythyr the son of Griedawl.  And this\nwas the peace that was made: --that the maiden should remain in her\nfather's house, without advantage to either of them, and that Gwyn ap\nNudd and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl should fight for her every first\nof May, from thenceforth until the day of doom, and that whichever of\nthem should then be conqueror should have the maiden.\n\nAnd when Arthur had thus reconciled these chieftains, he obtained\nMygdwn, Gweddw's horse, and the leash of Cwrs Cant Ewin.\n\nAnd after that Arthur went into Armorica, and with him Mabon the son\nof Mellt, and Gware Gwallt Euryn, to seek the two dogs of Glythmyr\nLedewic.  And when he had got them, he went to the West of Ireland,\nin search of Gwrgi Seven; and Odgar the son of Aedd king of Ireland\nwent with him.  And thence went Arthur into the North, and captured\nKyledyr Wyllt; and he went after Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd.  And Mabon the\nson of Mellt came with the two dogs of Glythmyr Ledewic in his hand,\nand Drudwyn, the cub of Greid the son of Eri.  And Arthur went\nhimself to the chase, leading his own dog Cavall.  And Kaw, of North\nBritain, mounted Arthur's mare Llamrei, and was first in the attack.\nThen Kaw, of North Britain, wielded a mighty axe, and absolutely\ndaring he came valiantly up to the boar, and clave his head in twain.\nAnd Kaw took away the tusk.  Now the boar was not slain by the dogs\nthat Yspaddaden had mentioned, but by Cavall, Arthur's own dog.\n\nAnd after Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd was killed, Arthur and his host\ndeparted to Gelli Wic in Cornwall.  And thence he sent Menw the son\nof Teirgwaedd to see if the precious things were between the two ears\nof Twrch Trwyth, since it were useless to encounter him if they were\nnot there.  Albeit it was certain where he was, for he had laid waste\nthe third part of Ireland.  And Menw went to seek for him, and he met\nwith him in Ireland, in Esgeir Oervel.  And Menw took the form of a\nbird; and he descended upon the top of his lair, and strove to snatch\naway one of the precious things from him, but he carried away nothing\nbut one of his bristles.  And the boar rose up angrily and shook\nhimself so that some of his venom fell upon Menw, and he was never\nwell from that day forward.\n\nAfter this Arthur sent an embassy to Odgar, the son of Aedd king of\nIreland, to ask for the cauldron of Diwrnach Wyddel, his purveyor.\nAnd Odgar commanded him to give it.  But Diwrnach said, \"Heaven is my\nwitness, if it would avail him anything even to look at it, he should\nnot do so.\"  And the embassy of Arthur returned from Ireland with\nthis denial.  And Arthur set forward with a small retinue, and\nentered into Prydwen, his ship, and went over to Ireland.  And they\nproceeded into the house of Diwrnach Wyddel.  And the hosts of Odgar\nsaw their strength.  When they had eaten and drunk as much as they\ndesired, Arthur demanded to have the cauldron.  And he answered, \"If\nI would have given it to any one, I would have given it at the word\nof Odgar king of Ireland.\"\n\nWhen he had given them this denial, Bedwyr arose and seized hold of\nthe cauldron, and placed it upon the back of Hygwyd, Arthur's\nservant, who was brother, by the mother's side, to Arthur's servant,\nCachamwri.  His office was always to carry Arthur's cauldron, and to\nplace fire under it.  And Llenlleawg Wyddel seized Caledvwlch, and\nbrandished it.  And they slew Diwrnach Wyddel and his company.  Then\ncame the Irish and fought with them.  And when he had put them to\nflight, Arthur with his men went forward to the ship, carrying away\nthe cauldron full of Irish money.  And he disembarked at the house of\nLlwydden the son of Kelcoed, at Porth Kerddin in Dyved.  And there is\nthe measure of the cauldron.\n\nThen Arthur summoned unto him all the warriors that were in the three\nIslands of Britain, and in the three Islands adjacent, and all that\nwere in France and in Armorica, in Normandy and in the Summer\nCountry, and all that were chosen footmen and valiant horsemen.  And\nwith all these he went into Ireland.  And in Ireland there was great\nfear and terror concerning him.  And when Arthur had landed in the\ncountry, there came unto him the saints of Ireland and besought his\nprotection.  And he granted his protection unto them, and they gave\nhim their blessing.  Then the men of Ireland came unto Arthur, and\nbrought him provisions.  And Arthur went as far as Esgeir Oervel in\nIreland, to the place where the Boar Trwyth was with his seven young\npigs.  And the dogs were let loose upon him from all sides.  That day\nuntil evening the Irish fought with him, nevertheless he laid waste\nthe fifth part of Ireland.  And on the day following the household of\nArthur fought with him, and they were worsted by him, and got no\nadvantage.  And the third day Arthur himself encountered him, and he\nfought with him nine nights and nine days without so much as killing\neven one little pig.  The warriors inquired of Arthur what was the\norigin of that swine; and he told them that he was once a king, and\nthat God had transformed him into a swine for his sins.\n\nThen Arthur sent Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, to endeavour to speak\nwith him.  And Gwrhyr assumed the form of a bird, and alighted upon\nthe top of the lair, where he was with the seven young pigs.  And\nGwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd asked him, \"By him who turned you into\nthis form, if you can speak, let some one of you, I beseech you, come\nand talk with Arthur.\"  Grugyn Gwrych Ereint made answer to him.\n(Now his bristles were like silver wire, and whether he went through\nthe wood or through the plain, he was to be traced by the glittering\nof his bristles.)  And this was the answer that Grugyn made:  \"By him\nwho turned us into this form, we will not do so, and we will not\nspeak with Arthur.  That we have been transformed thus is enough for\nus to suffer, without your coming here to fight with us.\"  \"I will\ntell you.  Arthur comes but to fight for the comb, and the razor, and\nthe scissors which are between the two ears of Twrch Trwyth.\"  Said\nGrugyn, \"Except he first take his life, he will never have those\nprecious things.  And to-morrow morning we will rise up hence, and we\nwill go into Arthur's country, and there will we do all the mischief\nthat we can.\"\n\nSo they set forth through the sea towards Wales.  And Arthur and his\nhosts, and his horses and his dogs, entered Prydwen, that they might\nencounter them without delay.  Twrch Trwyth landed in Porth Cleis in\nDyved, and Arthur came to Mynyw.  The next day it was told to Arthur\nthat they had gone by, and he overtook them as they were killing the\ncattle of Kynnwas Kwrr y Vagyl, having slain all that were at Aber\nGleddyf, of man and beast, before the coming of Arthur.\n\nNow when Arthur approached, Twrch Trwyth went on as far as Preseleu,\nand Arthur and his hosts followed him thither, and Arthur sent men to\nhunt him; Eli and Trachmyr, leading Drudwyn the whelp of Greid the\nson of Eri, and Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw, in another quarter, with\nthe two dogs of Glythmyr Ledewic, and Bedwyr leading Cavall, Arthur's\nown dog.  And all the warriors ranged themselves around the Nyver.\nAnd there came there the three sons of Cleddyf Divwlch, men who had\ngained much fame at the slaying of Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd; and they\nwent on from Glyn Nyver, and came to Cwm Kerwyn.\n\nAnd there Twrch Trwyth made a stand, and slew four of Arthur's\nchampions, Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw, and Tarawc of Allt Clwyd, and\nRheidwn the son of Eli Atver, and Iscovan Hael.  And after he had\nslain these men, he made a second stand in the same place.  And there\nhe slew Gwydre the son of Arthur, and Garselit Wyddel, and Glew the\nson of Ysgawd, and Iscawyn the son of Panon; and there he himself was\nwounded.\n\nAnd the next morning before it was day, some of the men came up with\nhim.  And he slew Huandaw, and Gogigwr, and Penpingon, three\nattendants upon Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr, so that Heaven knows he had not\nan attendant remaining, excepting only Llaesgevyn, a man from whom no\none ever derived any good.  And together with these he slew many of\nthe men of that country, and Gwlydyn Saer, Arthur's chief Architect.\n\nThen Arthur overtook him at Pelumyawc, and there he slew Madawc the\nson of Teithyon, and Gwyn the son of Tringad, the son of Neved, and\nEiryawn Penllorau.  Thence he went to Aberteivi, where he made\nanother stand, and where he slew Kyflas the son of Kynan, and\nGwilenhin king of France.  Then he went as far as Glyn Ystu, and\nthere the men and the dogs lost him.\n\nThen Arthur summoned unto him Gwyn ab Nudd, and he asked him if he\nknew aught of Twrch Trwyth.  And he said that he did not.\n\nAnd all the huntsmen went to hunt the swine as far as Dyffryn\nLlychwr.  And Grugyn Gwallt Ereint and Llwydawg Govynnyad closed with\nthem and killed all the huntsmen, so that there escaped but one man\nonly.  And Arthur and his hosts came to the place where Grugyn and\nLlwydawg were.  And there he let loose the whole of the dogs upon\nthem, and with the shout and barking that was set up, Twrch Trwyth\ncame to their assistance.\n\nAnd from the time that they came across the Irish sea, Arthur had\nnever got sight of him until then.  So he set men and dogs upon him,\nand thereupon he started off and went to Mynydd Amanw.  And there one\nof his young pigs was killed.  Then they set upon him life for life,\nand Twrch Llawin was slain, and then there was slain another of the\nswine, Gwys was his name.  After that he went on to Dyffryn Amanw,\nand there Banw and Bennwig were killed.  Of all his pigs there went\nwith him alive from that place none save Grugyn Gwallt Ereint and\nLlwydawg Govynnyad.\n\nThence he went on to Llwch Ewin, and Arthur overtook him there, and\nhe made a stand.  And there he slew Echel Forddwytwll, and Garwyli\nthe son of Gwyddawg Gwyr, and many men and dogs likewise.  And thence\nthey went to Llwch Tawy.  Grugyn Gwrych Ereint parted from them\nthere, and went to Din Tywi.  And thence he proceeded to Ceredigiawn,\nand Eli and Trachmyr with him, and a multitude likewise.  Then he\ncame to Garth Gregyn, and there Llwydawg Govynnyad fought in the\nmidst of them, and slew Rhudvyw Rhys and many others with him.  Then\nLlwydawg went thence to Ystrad Yw, and there the men of Armorica met\nhim, and there he slew Hirpeissawg the king of Armorica, and\nLlygatrudd Emys, and Gwrbothu, Arthur's uncles, his mother's\nbrothers, and there was he himself slain.\n\nTwrch Trwyth went from there to between Tawy and Euyas, and Arthur\nsummoned all Cornwall and Devon unto him, to the estuary of the\nSevern, and he said to the warriors of this Island, \"Twrch Trwyth has\nslain many of my men, but, by the valour of warriors, while I live he\nshall not go into Cornwall.  And I will not follow him any longer,\nbut I will oppose him life to life.  Do ye as ye will.\"  And he\nresolved that he would send a body of knights, with the dogs of the\nIsland, as far as Euyas, who should return thence to the Severn, and\nthat tried warriors should traverse the Island, and force him into\nthe Severn.  And Mabon the son of Modron came up with him at the\nSevern, upon Gwynn Mygdwn, the horse of Gweddw, and Goreu the son of\nCustennin, and Menw the son of Teirgwaedd; this was betwixt Llyn\nLliwan and Aber Gwy.  And Arthur fell upon him together with the\nchampions of Britain.  And Osla Kyllellvawr drew near, and Manawyddan\nthe son of Llyr, and Kacmwri the servant of Arthur, and Gwyngelli,\nand they seized hold of him, catching him first by his feet, and\nplunged him in the Severn, so that it overwhelmed him.  On the one\nside, Mabon the son of Modron spurred his steed and snatched his\nrazor from him, and Kyledyr Wyllt came up with him on the other side,\nupon another steed, in the Severn, and took from him the scissors.\nBut before they could obtain the comb, he had regained the ground\nwith his feet, and from the moment that he reached the shore, neither\ndog, nor man, nor horse could overtake him until he came to Cornwall.\nIf they had had trouble in getting the jewels from him, much more had\nthey in seeking to save the two men from being drowned.  Kacmwri, as\nthey drew him forth, was dragged by two millstones into the deep.\nAnd as Osla Kyllellvawr was running after the boar, his knife had\ndropped out of the sheath, and he had lost it, and after that, the\nsheath became full of water, and its weight drew him down into the\ndeep, as they were drawing him forth.\n\nThen Arthur and his hosts proceeded until they overtook the boar in\nCornwall, and the trouble which they had met with before was mere\nplay to what they encountered in seeking the comb.  But from one\ndifficulty to another, the comb was at length obtained.  And then he\nwas hunted from Cornwall, and driven straight forward into the deep\nsea.  And thenceforth it was never known whither he went; and Aned\nand Aethlem with him.  Then went Arthur to Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, to\nanoint himself, and to rest from his fatigues.\n\nSaid Arthur, \"Is there any one of the marvels yet unobtained?\"  Said\none of his men, \"There is--the blood of the witch Orddu, the daughter\nof the witch Orwen, of Pen Nant Govid, on the confines of Hell.\"\nArthur set forth towards the North, and came to the place where was\nthe witch's cave.  And Gwyn ab Nudd, and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl,\ncounselled him to send Kacmwri, and Hygwyd his brother, to fight with\nthe witch.  And as they entered the cave, the witch seized upon them,\nand she caught Hygwyd by the hair of his head, and threw him on the\nfloor beneath her.  And Kacmwri caught her by the hair of her head,\nand dragged her to the earth from off Hygwyd, but she turned again\nupon them both, and drove them both out with kicks and with cuffs.\n\nAnd Arthur was wroth at seeing his two attendants almost slain, and\nhe sought to enter the cave; but Gwyn and Gwythyr said unto him, \"It\nwould not be fitting or seemly for us to see thee squabbling with a\nhag.  Let Hiramreu and Hireidil go to the cave.\"  So they went.  But\nif great was the trouble of the first two that went, much greater was\nthat of these two.  And Heaven knows that not one of the four could\nmove from the spot, until they placed them all upon Llamrei, Arthur's\nmare.  And then Arthur rushed to the door of the cave, and at the\ndoor he struck at the witch, with Carnwennan his dagger, and clove\nher in twain, so that she fell in two parts.  And Kaw, of North\nBritain, took the blood of the witch and kept it.\n\nThen Kilhwch set forward, and Goreu the son of Custennin with him,\nand as many as wished ill to Yspaddaden Penkawr.  And they took the\nmarvels with them to his court.  And Kaw of North Britain came and\nshaved his beard, skin, and flesh clean off to the very bone from ear\nto ear.  \"Art thou shaved, man?\" said Kilhwch.  \"I am shaved,\"\nanswered he.  \"Is thy daughter mine now?\"  \"She is thine,\" said he,\n\"but therefore needest thou not thank me, but Arthur who hath\naccomplished this for thee.  By my free will thou shouldest never\nhave had her, for with her I lose my life.\"  Then Goreu the son of\nCustennin seized him by the hair of his head, and dragged him after\nhim to the keep, and cut off his head and placed it on a stake on the\ncitadel.  Then they took possession of his castle, and of his\ntreasures.\n\nAnd that night Olwen became Kilhwch's bride, and she continued to be\nhis wife as long as she lived.  And the hosts of Arthur dispersed\nthemselves, each man to his own country.  And thus did Kilhwch obtain\nOlwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.\n\n\n\nTHE DREAM OF RHONABWY\n\n\n\nMadawc the son of Maredudd possessed Powys within its boundaries,\nfrom Porfoed to Gwauan in the uplands of Arwystli.  And at that time\nhe had a brother, Iorwerth the son of Maredudd, in rank not equal to\nhimself.  And Iorwerth had great sorrow and heaviness because of the\nhonour and power that his brother enjoyed, which he shared not.  And\nhe sought his fellows and his foster-brothers, and took counsel with\nthem what he should do in this matter.  And they resolved to dispatch\nsome of their number to go and seek a maintenance for him.  Then\nMadawc offered him to become Master of the Household and to have\nhorses, and arms, and honour, and to fare like as himself.  But\nIorwerth refused this.\n\nAnd Iorwerth made an inroad into Loegria, slaying the inhabitants,\nand burning houses, and carrying away prisoners.  And Madawc took\ncounsel with the men of Powys, and they determined to place an\nhundred men in each of the three Commots of Powys to seek for him.\nAnd thus did they in the plains of Powys from Aber Ceirawc, and in\nAllictwn Ver, and in Rhyd Wilure, on the Vyrnwy, the three best\nCommots of Powys.  So he was none the better, he nor his household,\nin Powys, nor in the plains thereof.  And they spread these men over\nthe plains as far as Nillystwn Trevan.\n\nNow one of the men who was upon this quest was called Rhonabwy.  And\nRhonabwy and Kynwrig Vrychgoch, a man of Mawddwy, and Cadwgan Vras, a\nman of Moelvre in Kynlleith, came together to the house of Heilyn\nGoch the son of Cadwgan the son of Iddon.  And when they came near to\nthe house, they saw an old hall, very black and having an upright\ngable, whence issued a great smoke; and on entering, they found the\nfloor full of puddles and mounds; and it was difficult to stand\nthereon, so slippery was it with the mire of cattle.  And where the\npuddles were, a man might go up to his ankles in water and dirt.  And\nthere were boughs of holly spread over the floor, whereof the cattle\nhad browsed the sprigs.  When they came to the hall of the house,\nthey beheld cells full of dust, and very gloomy, and on one side an\nold hag making a fire.  And whenever she felt cold, she cast a lapful\nof chaff upon the fire, and raised such a smoke, that it was scarcely\nto be borne, as it rose up the nostrils.  And on the other side was a\nyellow calf-skin on the floor; a main privilege was it to any one who\nshould get upon that hide.\n\nAnd when they had sat down, they asked the hag where were the people\nof the house.  And the hag spoke not, but muttered.  Thereupon behold\nthe people of the house entered; a ruddy, clownish, curly-headed man,\nwith a burthen of faggots on his back, and a pale slender woman, also\ncarrying a bundle under her arm.  And they barely welcomed the men,\nand kindled a fire with the boughs.  And the woman cooked something,\nand gave them to eat, barley bread, and cheese, and milk and water.\n\nAnd there arose a storm of wind and rain, so that it was hardly\npossible to go forth with safety.  And being weary with their\njourney, they laid themselves down and sought to sleep.  And when\nthey looked at the couch, it seemed to be made but of a little coarse\nstraw full of dust and vermin, with the stems of boughs sticking up\nthere-through, for the cattle had eaten all the straw that was placed\nat the head and the foot.  And upon it was stretched an old russet-\ncoloured rug, threadbare and ragged; and a coarse sheet, full of\nslits, was upon the rug, and an ill-stuffed pillow, and a worn-out\ncover upon the sheet.  And after much suffering from the vermin, and\nfrom the discomfort of their couch, a heavy sleep fell on Rhonabwy's\ncompanions.  But Rhonabwy, not being able either to sleep or to rest,\nthought he should suffer less if he went to lie upon the yellow calf-\nskin that was stretched out on the floor.  And there he slept.\n\nAs soon as sleep had come upon his eyes, it seemed to him that he was\njourneying with his companions across the plain of Argyngroeg, and he\nthought that he went towards Rhyd y Groes on the Severn.  As he\njourneyed, he heard a mighty noise, the like whereof heard he never\nbefore; and looking behind him, he beheld a youth with yellow curling\nhair, and with his beard newly trimmed, mounted on a chestnut horse,\nwhereof the legs were grey from the top of the forelegs, and from the\nbend of the hindlegs downwards.  And the rider wore a coat of yellow\nsatin sewn with green silk, and on his thigh was a gold-hilted sword,\nwith a scabbard of new leather of Cordova, belted with the skin of\nthe deer, and clasped with gold.  And over this was a scarf of yellow\nsatin wrought with green silk, the borders whereof were likewise\ngreen.  And the green of the caparison of the horse, and of his\nrider, was as green as the leaves of the fir-tree, and the yellow was\nas yellow as the blossom of the broom.  So fierce was the aspect of\nthe knight, that fear seized upon them, and they began to flee.  And\nthe knight pursued them.  And when the horse breathed forth, the men\nbecame distant from him, and when he drew in his breath, they were\ndrawn near to him, even to the horse's chest.  And when he had\novertaken them, they besought his mercy.  \"You have it gladly,\" said\nhe, \"fear nought.\"  \"Ha, chieftain, since thou hast mercy upon me,\ntell me also who thou art,\" said Rhonabwy.  \"I will not conceal my\nlineage from thee, I am Iddawc the son of Mynyo, yet not by my name,\nbut by my nickname am I best known.\"  \"And wilt thou tell us what thy\nnickname is?\"  \"I will tell you; it is Iddawc Cordd Prydain.\"  \"Ha,\nchieftain,\" said Rhonabwy, \"why art thou called thus?\"  \"I will tell\nthee.  I was one of the messengers between Arthur and Medrawd his\nnephew, at the battle of Camlan; and I was then a reckless youth, and\nthrough my desire for battle, I kindled strife between them, and\nstirred up wrath, when I was sent by Arthur the Emperor to reason\nwith Medrawd, and to show him, that he was his foster-father and his\nuncle, and to seek for peace, lest the sons of the Kings of the\nIsland of Britain, and of the nobles, should be slain.  And whereas\nArthur charged me with the fairest sayings he could think of, I\nuttered unto Medrawd the harshest I could devise.  And therefore am I\ncalled Iddawc Cordd Prydain, for from this did the battle of Camlan\nensue.  And three nights before the end of the battle of Camlan I\nleft them, and went to the Llech Las in North Britain to do penance.\nAnd there I remained doing penance seven years, and after that I\ngained pardon.\"\n\nThen lo! they heard a mighty sound which was much louder than that\nwhich they had heard before, and when they looked round towards the\nsound, they beheld a ruddy youth, without beard or whiskers, noble of\nmien, and mounted on a stately courser.  And from the shoulders and\nthe front of the knees downwards the horse was bay.  And upon the man\nwas a dress of red satin wrought with yellow silk, and yellow were\nthe borders of his scarf.  And such parts of his apparel and of the\ntrappings of his horse as were yellow, as yellow were they as the\nblossom of the broom, and such as were red, were as ruddy as the\nruddiest blood in the world.\n\nThen, behold the horseman overtook them, and he asked of Iddawc a\nshare of the little men that were with him.  \"That which is fitting\nfor me to grant I will grant, and thou shalt be a companion to them\nas I have been.\"  And the horseman went away.  \"Iddawc,\" inquired\nRhonabwy, \"who was that horseman?\"  \"Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince\nDeorthach.\"\n\nAnd they journeyed over the plain of Argyngroeg as far as the ford of\nRhyd y Groes on the Severn.  And for a mile around the ford on both\nsides of the road, they saw tents and encampments, and there was the\nclamour of a mighty host.  And they came to the edge of the ford, and\nthere they beheld Arthur sitting on a flat island below the ford,\nhaving Bedwini the Bishop on one side of him, and Gwarthegyd the son\nof Kaw on the other.  And a tall, auburn-haired youth stood before\nhim, with his sheathed sword in his hand, and clad in a coat and cap\nof jet-black satin.  And his face was white as ivory, and his\neyebrows black as jet, and such part of his wrist as could be seen\nbetween his glove and his sleeve, was whiter than the lily, and\nthicker than a warrior's ankle.\n\nThen came Iddawc and they that were with him, and stood before Arthur\nand saluted him.  \"Heaven grant thee good,\" said Arthur.  \"And where,\nIddawc, didst thou find these little men?\"  \"I found them, lord, up\nyonder on the road.\"  Then the Emperor smiled.  \"Lord,\" said Iddawc,\n\"wherefore dost thou laugh?\"  \"Iddawc,\" replied Arthur, \"I laugh not;\nbut it pitieth me that men of such stature as these should have this\nisland in their keeping, after the men that guarded it of yore.\"\nThen said Iddawc, \"Rhonabwy, dost thou see the ring with a stone set\nin it, that is upon the Emperor's hand?\"  \"I see it,\" he answered.\n\"It is one of the properties of that stone to enable thee to remember\nthat thou seest here to-night, and hadst thou not seen the stone,\nthou wouldest never have been able to remember aught thereof.\"\n\nAfter this they saw a troop coming towards the ford.  \"Iddawc,\"\ninquired Rhonabwy, \"to whom does yonder troop belong?\"  \"They are the\nfellows of Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince Deorthach.  And these men\nare honourably served with mead and bragget, and are freely beloved\nby the daughters of the kings of the Island of Britain.  And this\nthey merit, for they were ever in the front and the rear in every\nperil.\"  And he saw but one hue upon the men and the horses of this\ntroop, for they were all as red as blood.  And when one of the\nknights rode forth from the troop, he looked like a pillar of fire\nglancing athwart the sky.  And this troop encamped above the ford.\n\nThen they beheld another troop coming towards the ford, and these\nfrom their horses' chests upwards were whiter than the lily, and\nbelow blacker than jet.  And they saw one of these knights go before\nthe rest, and spur his horse into the ford in such a manner that the\nwater dashed over Arthur and the Bishop, and those holding counsel\nwith them, so that they were as wet as if they had been drenched in\nthe river.  And as he turned the head of his horse, the youth who\nstood before Arthur struck the horse over the nostrils with his\nsheathed sword, so that, had it been with the bare blade, it would\nhave been a marvel if the bone had not been wounded as well as the\nflesh.  And the knight drew his sword half out of the scabbard, and\nasked of him, \"Wherefore didst thou strike my horse?  Whether was it\nin insult or in counsel unto me?\"  \"Thou dost indeed lack counsel.\nWhat madness caused thee to ride so furiously as to dash the water of\nthe ford over Arthur, and the consecrated Bishop, and their\ncounsellors, so that they were as wet as if they had been dragged out\nof the river?\"  \"As counsel then will I take it.\"  So he turned his\nhorse's head round towards his army.\n\n\"Iddawc,\" said Rhonabwy, \"who was yonder knight?\"  \"The most eloquent\nand the wisest youth that is in this island; Adaon, the son of\nTaliesin.\"  \"Who was the man that struck his horse?\"  \"A youth of\nfroward nature; Elphin, the son of Gwyddno.\"\n\nThen spake a tall and stately man, of noble and flowing speech,\nsaying that it was a marvel that so vast a host should be assembled\nin so narrow a space, and that it was a still greater marvel that\nthose should be there at that time who had promised to be by mid-day\nin the battle of Badon, fighting with Osla Gyllellvawr.  \"Whether\nthou mayest choose to proceed or not, I will proceed.\"  \"Thou sayest\nwell,\" said Arthur, \"and we will go altogether.\"  \"Iddawc,\" said\nRhonabwy, \"who was the man who spoke so marvellously unto Arthur\nerewhile?\"  \"A man who may speak as boldly as he listeth, Caradawc\nVreichvras, the son of Llyr Marini, his chief counsellor and his\ncousin.\"\n\nThen Iddawc took Rhonabwy behind him on his horse, and that mighty\nhost moved forward, each troop in its order, towards Cevndigoll.  And\nwhen they came to the middle of the ford of the Severn, Iddawc turned\nhis horse's head, and Rhonabwy looked along the valley of the Severn.\nAnd he beheld two fair troops coming towards the ford.  One troop\nthere came of brilliant white, whereof every one of the men had a\nscarf of white satin with jet-black borders.  And the knees and the\ntops of the shoulders of their horses were jet-black, though they\nwere of a pure white in every other part.  And their banners were\npure white, with black points to them all.\n\n\"Iddawc,\" said Rhonabwy, \"who are yonder pure white troop?\"  \"They\nare the men of Norway, and March the son of Meirchion is their\nprince.  And he is cousin unto Arthur.\"  And further on he saw a\ntroop, whereof each man wore garments of jet-black, with borders of\npure white to every scarf; and the tops of the shoulders and the\nknees of their horses were pure white.  And their banners were jet-\nblack with pure white at the point of each.\n\n\"Iddawc,\" said Rhonabwy, \"who are the jet-black troop yonder?\"  \"They\nare the men of Denmark, and Edeyrn the son of Nudd is their prince.\"\n\nAnd when they had overtaken the host, Arthur and his army of mighty\nones dismounted below Caer Badou, and he perceived that he and Iddawc\njourneyed the same road as Arthur.  And after they had dismounted he\nheard a great tumult and confusion amongst the host, and such as were\nthen at the flanks turned to the centre, and such as had been in the\ncentre moved to the flanks.  And then, behold, he saw a knight\ncoming, clad, both he and his horse, in mail, of which the rings were\nwhiter than the whitest lily, and the rivets redder than the ruddiest\nblood.  And he rode amongst the host.\n\n\"Iddawc,\" said Rhonabwy, \"will yonder host flee?\"  \"King Arthur never\nfled, and if this discourse of thine were heard, thou wert a lost\nman.  But as to the knight whom thou seest yonder, it is Kai.  The\nfairest horseman is Kai in all Arthur's Court; and the men who are at\nthe front of the army hasten to the rear to see Kai ride, and the men\nwho are in the centre flee to the side, from the shock of his horse.\nAnd this is the cause of the confusion of the host.\"\n\nThereupon they heard a call made for Kadwr, Earl of Cornwall, and\nbehold he arose with the sword of Arthur in his hand.  And the\nsimilitude of two serpents was upon the sword in gold.  And when the\nsword was drawn from its scabbard, it seemed as if two flames of fire\nburst forth from the jaws of the serpents, and then, so wonderful was\nthe sword, that it was hard for any one to look upon it.  And the\nhost became still, and the tumult ceased, and the Earl returned to\nthe tent.\n\n\"Iddawc,\" said Rhonabwy, \"who is the man who bore the sword of\nArthur?\"  \"Kadwr, the Earl of Cornwall, whose duty it is to arm the\nKing on the days of battle and warfare.\"\n\nAnd they heard a call made for Eirynwych Amheibyn, Arthur's servant,\na red, rough, ill-favoured man, having red whiskers with bristly\nhairs.  And behold he came upon a tall red horse with the mane parted\non each side, and he brought with him a large and beautiful sumpter\npack.  And the huge red youth dismounted before Arthur, and he drew a\ngolden chair out of the pack, and a carpet of diapered satin.  And he\nspread the carpet before Arthur, and there was an apple of ruddy gold\nat each corner thereof, and he placed the chair upon the carpet.  And\nso large was the chair that three armed warriors might have sat\ntherein.  Gwenn was the name of the carpet, and it was one of its\nproperties that whoever was upon it no one could see him, and he\ncould see every one.  And it would retain no colour but its own.\n\nAnd Arthur sat within the carpet, and Owain the son of Urien was\nstanding before him.  \"Owain,\" said Arthur, \"wilt thou play chess?\"\n\"I will, Lord,\" said Owain.  And the red youth brought the chess for\nArthur and Owain; golden pieces and a board of silver.  And they\nbegan to play.\n\nAnd while they were thus, and when they were best amused with their\ngame, behold they saw a white tent with a red canopy, and the figure\nof a jet-black serpent on the top of the tent, and red glaring\nvenomous eyes in the head of the serpent, and a red flaming tongue.\nAnd there came a young page with yellow curling hair, and blue eyes,\nand a newly-springing beard, wearing a coat and a surcoat of yellow\nsatin, and hose of thin greenish-yellow cloth upon his feet, and over\nhis hose shoes of parti-coloured leather, fastened at the insteps\nwith golden clasps.  And he bore a heavy three-edged sword with a\ngolden hilt, in a scabbard of black leather tipped with fine gold.\nAnd he came to the place where the Emperor and Owain were playing at\nchess.\n\nAnd the youth saluted Owain.  And Owain marvelled that the youth\nshould salute him and should not have saluted the Emperor Arthur.\nAnd Arthur knew what was in Owain's thought.  And he said to Owain,\n\"Marvel not that the youth salutes thee now, for he saluted me\nerewhile; and it is unto thee that his errand is.\"  Then said the\nyouth unto Owain, \"Lord, is it with thy leave that the young pages\nand attendants of the Emperor harass and torment and worry thy\nRavens?  And if it be not with thy leave, cause the Emperor to forbid\nthem.\"  \"Lord,\" said Owain, \"thou hearest what the youth says; if it\nseem good to thee, forbid them from my Ravens.\"  \"Play thy game,\"\nsaid he.  Then the youth returned to the tent.\n\nThat game did they finish, and another they began, and when they were\nin the midst of the game, behold, a ruddy young man with auburn\ncurling hair and large eyes, well-grown, and having his beard new-\nshorn, came forth from a bright yellow tent, upon the summit of which\nwas the figure of a bright red lion.  And he was clad in a coat of\nyellow satin, falling as low as the small of his leg, and embroidered\nwith threads of red silk.  And on his feet were hose of fine white\nbuckram, and buskins of black leather were over his hose, whereon\nwere golden clasps.  And in his hand a huge, heavy, three-edged\nsword, with a scabbard of red deer-hide, tipped with gold.  And he\ncame to the place where Arthur and Owain were playing at chess.  And\nhe saluted him.  And Owain was troubled at his salutation, but Arthur\nminded it no more than before.  And the youth said unto Owain, \"Is it\nnot against thy will that the attendants of the Emperor harass thy\nRavens, killing some and worrying others?  If against thy will it be,\nbeseech him to forbid them.\"  \"Lord,\" said Owain, \"forbid thy men, if\nit seem good to thee.\"  \"Play thy game,\" said the Emperor.  And the\nyouth returned to the tent.\n\nAnd that game was ended and another begun.  And as they were\nbeginning the first move of the game, they beheld at a small distance\nfrom them a tent speckled yellow, the largest ever seen, and the\nfigure of an eagle of gold upon it, and a precious stone on the\neagle's head.  And coming out of the tent, they saw a youth with\nthick yellow hair upon his head, fair and comely, and a scarf of blue\nsatin upon him, and a brooch of gold in the scarf upon his right\nshoulder as large as a warrior's middle finger.  And upon his feet\nwere hose of fine Totness, and shoes of parti-coloured leather,\nclasped with gold, and the youth was of noble bearing, fair of face,\nwith ruddy cheeks and large hawk's eyes.  In the hand of the youth\nwas a mighty lance, speckled yellow, with a newly-sharpened head; and\nupon the lance a banner displayed.\n\nFiercely angry, and with rapid pace, came the youth to the place\nwhere Arthur was playing at chess with Owain.  And they perceived\nthat he was wroth.  And thereupon he saluted Owain, and told him that\nhis Ravens had been killed, the chief part of them, and that such of\nthem as were not slain were so wounded and bruised that not one of\nthem could raise its wings a single fathom above the earth.  \"Lord,\"\nsaid Owain, \"forbid thy men.\"  \"Play,\" said he, \"if it please thee.\"\nThen said Owain to the youth, \"Go back, and wherever thou findest the\nstrife at the thickest, there lift up the banner, and let come what\npleases Heaven.\"\n\nSo the youth returned back to the place where the strife bore hardest\nupon the Ravens, and he lifted up the banner; and as he did so they\nall rose up in the air, wrathful and fierce and high of spirit,\nclapping their wings in the wind, and shaking off the weariness that\nwas upon them.  And recovering their energy and courage, furiously\nand with exultation did they, with one sweep, descend upon the heads\nof the men, who had erewhile caused them anger and pain and damage,\nand they seized some by the heads and others by the eyes, and some by\nthe ears, and others by the arms, and carried them up into the air;\nand in the air there was a mighty tumult with the flapping of the\nwings of the triumphant Ravens, and with their croaking; and there\nwas another mighty tumult with the groaning of the men, that were\nbeing torn and wounded, and some of whom were slain.\n\nAnd Arthur and Owain marvelled at the tumult as they played at chess;\nand, looking, they perceived a knight upon a dun-coloured horse\ncoming towards them.  And marvellous was the hue of the dun horse.\nBright red was his right shoulder, and from the top of his legs to\nthe centre of his hoof was bright yellow.  Both the knight and his\nhorse were fully equipped with heavy foreign armour.  The clothing of\nthe horse from the front opening upwards was of bright red sendal,\nand from thence opening downwards was of bright yellow sendal.  A\nlarge gold-hilted one-edged sword had the youth upon his thigh, in a\nscabbard of light blue, and tipped with Spanish laton.  The belt of\nthe sword was of dark green leather with golden slides and a clasp of\nivory upon it, and a buckle of jet-black upon the clasp.  A helmet of\ngold was on the head of the knight, set with precious stones of great\nvirtue, and at the top of the helmet was the image of a flame-\ncoloured leopard with two ruby-red stones in its head, so that it was\nastounding for a warrior, however stout his heart, to look at the\nface of the leopard, much more at the face of the knight.  He had in\nhis hand a blue-shafted lance, but from the haft to the point it was\nstained crimson-red with the blood of the Ravens and their plumage.\n\nThe knight came to the place where Arthur and Owain were seated at\nchess.  And they perceived that he was harassed and vexed and weary\nas he came towards them.  And the youth saluted Arthur, and told him\nthat the Ravens of Owain were slaying his young men and attendants.\nAnd Arthur looked at Owain and said, \"Forbid thy Ravens.\"  \"Lord,\"\nanswered Owain, \"play thy game.\"  And they played.  And the knight\nreturned back towards the strife, and the Ravens were not forbidden\nany more than before.\n\nAnd when they had played awhile, they heard a mighty tumult, and a\nwailing of men, and a croaking of Ravens, as they carried the men in\ntheir strength into the air, and, tearing them betwixt them, let them\nfall piecemeal to the earth.  And during the tumult they saw a knight\ncoming towards them, on a light grey horse, and the left foreleg of\nthe horse was jet-black to the centre of his hoof.  And the knight\nand the horse were fully accoutred with huge heavy blue armour.  And\na robe of honour of yellow diapered satin was upon the knight, and\nthe borders of the robe were blue.  And the housings of the horse\nwere jet-black, with borders of bright yellow.  And on the thigh of\nthe youth was a sword, long, and three-edged, and heavy.  And the\nscabbard was of red cut leather, and the belt of new red deer-skin,\nhaving upon it many golden slides and a buckle of the bone of the\nsea-horse, the tongue of which was jet-black.  A golden helmet was\nupon the head of the knight, wherein were set sapphire-stones of\ngreat virtue.  And at the top of the helmet was the figure of a\nflame-coloured lion, with a fiery-red tongue, issuing above a foot\nfrom his mouth, and with venomous eyes, crimson-red, in his head.\nAnd the knight came, bearing in his hand a thick ashen lance, the\nhead whereof, which had been newly steeped in blood, was overlaid\nwith silver.\n\nAnd the youth saluted the Emperor:  \"Lord,\" said he, \"carest thou not\nfor the slaying of thy pages, and thy young men, and the sons of the\nnobles of the Island of Britain, whereby it will be difficult to\ndefend this island from henceforward for ever?\"  \"Owain,\" said\nArthur, \"forbid thy Ravens.\"  \"Play this game, Lord,\" said Owain.\n\nSo they finished the game and began another; and as they were\nfinishing that game, lo, they heard a great tumult and a clamour of\narmed men, and a croaking of Ravens, and a flapping of wings in the\nair, as they flung down the armour entire to the ground, and the men\nand the horses piecemeal.  Then they saw coming a knight on a lofty-\nheaded piebald horse.  And the left shoulder of the horse was of\nbright red, and its right leg from the chest to the hollow of the\nhoof was pure white.  And the knight and horse were equipped with\narms of speckled yellow, variegated with Spanish laton.  And there\nwas a robe of honour upon him, and upon his horse, divided in two\nparts, white and black, and the borders of the robe of honour were of\ngolden purple.  And above the robe he wore a sword three-edged and\nbright, with a golden hilt.  And the belt of the sword was of yellow\ngoldwork, having a clasp upon it of the eyelid of a black sea-horse,\nand a tongue of yellow gold to the clasp.  Upon the head of the\nknight was a bright helmet of yellow laton, with sparkling stones of\ncrystal in it, and at the crest of the helmet was the figure of a\ngriffin, with a stone of many virtues in its head.  And he had an\nashen spear in his hand, with a round shaft, coloured with azure\nblue.  And the head of the spear was newly stained with blood, and\nwas overlaid with fine silver.\n\nWrathfully came the knight to the place where Arthur was, and he told\nhim that the Ravens had slain his household and the sons of the chief\nmen of this island, and he besought him to cause Owain to forbid his\nRavens.  And Arthur besought Owain to forbid them.  Then Arthur took\nthe golden chessmen that were upon the board, and crushed them until\nthey became as dust.  Then Owain ordered Gwres the son of Rheged to\nlower his banner.  So it was lowered, and all was peace.\n\nThen Rhonabwy inquired of Iddawc who were the first three men that\ncame to Owain, to tell him his Ravens were being slain.  Said Iddawc,\n\"They were men who grieved that Owain should suffer loss, his fellow-\nchieftains and companions, Selyv the son of Kynan Garwyn of Powys,\nand Gwgawn Gleddyvrudd, and Gwres the son of Rheged, he who bears the\nbanner in the day of battle and strife.\"  \"Who,\" said Rhonabwy, \"were\nthe last three men who came to Arthur, and told him that the Ravens\nwere slaughtering his men?\"  \"The best of men,\" said Iddawc, \"and the\nbravest, and who would grieve exceedingly that Arthur should have\ndamage in aught; Blathaon the son of Mawrheth, and Rhuvawn Pebyr the\nson of Prince Deorthach, and Hyveidd Unllenn.\"\n\nAnd with that behold four-and-twenty knights came from Osla\nGyllellvawr, to crave a truce of Arthur for a fortnight and a month.\nAnd Arthur rose and went to take counsel.  And he came to where a\ntall, auburn, curly-headed man was a little way off, and there he\nassembled his counsellors.  Bedwini, the Bishop, and Gwarthegyd the\nson of Kaw, and March the son of Meirchawn, and Caradawc Vreichvras,\nand Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, and Edeyrn the son of Nudd, and\nRhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince Deorthach, and Rhiogan the son of the\nKing of Ireland, and Gwenwynwyn the son of Nav, Howel the son of Emyr\nLlydaw, Gwilym the son of Rhwyf Freinc, and Daned the son of Ath, and\nGoreu Custennin, and Mabon the son of Modron, and Peredur Paladyr\nHir, and Hyveidd Unllenn, and Twrch the son of Perif, and Nerth the\nson of Kadarn, and Gobrwy the son of Echel Vorddwyttwll, Gwair the\nson of Gwestyl, and Gadwy the son of Geraint, Trystan the son of\nTallwch, Moryen Manawc, Granwen the son of Llyr, and Llacheu the son\nof Arthur, and Llawvrodedd Varvawc, and Kadwr Earl of Cornwall,\nMorvran the son of Tegid, and Rhyawd the son of Morgant, and Dyvyr\nthe son of Alun Dyved, Gwrhyr Gwalstawd Ieithoedd, Adaon the son of\nTaliesin, Llary the son of Kasnar Wledig, and Fflewddur Fflam, and\nGreidawl Galldovydd, Gilbert the son of Kadgyffro, Menw the son of\nTeirgwaedd, Gwrthmwl Wledig, Cawrdav the son of Caradawc Vreichvras,\nGildas the son of Kaw, Kadyriaith the son of Saidi, and many of the\nmen of Norway and Denmark, and many of the men of Greece, and a crowd\nof the men of the host came to that council.\n\n\"Iddawc,\" said Rhonabwy, \"who was the auburn haired man to whom they\ncame just now?\"  \"Rhun the son of Maelgwn Gwynedd, a man whose\nprerogative it is, that he may join in counsel with all.\"  \"And\nwherefore did they admit into counsel with men of such dignity as are\nyonder a stripling so young as Kadyriaith the son of Saidi?\"\n\"Because there is not throughout Britain a man better skilled in\ncounsel than he.\"\n\nThereupon, behold, bards came and recited verses before Arthur, and\nno man understood those verses but Kadyriaith only, save that they\nwere in Arthur's praise.\n\nAnd lo, there came four-and-twenty asses with their burdens of gold\nand of silver, and a tired way-worn man with each of them, bringing\ntribute to Arthur from the Islands of Greece.  Then Kadyriaith the\nson of Saidi besought that a truce might be granted to Osla\nGyllellvawr for the space of a fortnight and a month, and that the\nasses and the burdens they carried might be given to the bards, to be\nto them as the reward for their stay and that their verse might be\nrecompensed during the time of the truce.  And thus it was settled.\n\n\"Rhonabwy,\" said Iddawc, \"would it not be wrong to forbid a youth who\ncan give counsel so liberal as this from coming to the councils of\nhis Lord?\"\n\nThen Kai arose, and he said, \"Whosoever will follow Arthur, let him\nbe with him to-night in Cornwall, and whosoever will not, let him be\nopposed to Arthur even during the truce.\"  And through the greatness\nof the tumult that ensued, Rhonabwy awoke.  And when he awoke he was\nupon the yellow calf-skin, having slept three nights and three days.\n\nAnd this tale is called the Dream of Rhonabwy.  And this is the\nreason that no one knows the dream without a book, neither bard nor\ngifted seer; because of the various colours that were upon the\nhorses, and the many wondrous colours of the arms and of the panoply,\nand of the precious scarfs, and of the virtue-bearing stones.\n\n\n\nPWYLL PRINCE OF DYVED\n\n\n\nPwyll Prince of Dyved was lord of the seven Cantrevs of Dyved; and\nonce upon a time he was at Narberth his chief palace, and he was\nminded to go and hunt, and the part of his dominions in which it\npleased him to hunt was Glyn Cuch.  So he set forth from Narbeth that\nnight, and went as far as Llwyn Diarwyd.  And that night he tarried\nthere, and early on the morrow he rose and came to Glyn Cuch, when he\nlet loose the dogs in the wood, and sounded the horn, and began the\nchase.  And as he followed the dogs, he lost his companions; and\nwhilst he listened to the hounds, he heard the cry of other hounds, a\ncry different from his own, and coming in the opposite direction.\n\nAnd he beheld a glade in the wood forming a level plain, and as his\ndogs came to the edge of the glade, he saw a stag before the other\ndogs.  And lo, as it reached the middle of the glade, the dogs that\nfollowed the stag overtook it and brought it down.  Then looked he at\nthe colour of the dogs, staying not to look at the stag, and of all\nthe hounds that he had seen in the world, he had never seen any that\nwere like unto these.  For their hair was of a brilliant shining\nwhite, and their ears were red; and as the whiteness of their bodies\nshone, so did the redness of their ears glisten.  And he came towards\nthe dogs, and drove away those that had brought down the stag, and\nset his own dogs upon it.\n\nAnd as he was setting on his dogs he saw a horseman coming towards\nhim upon a large light-grey steed, with a hunting horn round his\nneck, and clad in garments of grey woollen in the fashion of a\nhunting garb.  And the horseman drew near and spoke unto him thus.\n\"Chieftain,\" said he, \"I know who thou art, and I greet thee not.\"\n\"Peradventure,\" said Pwyll, \"thou art of such dignity that thou\nshouldest not do so.\"  \"Verily,\" answered he, \"it is not my dignity\nthat prevents me.\"  \"What is it then, O Chieftain?\" asked he.  \"By\nHeaven, it is by reason of thine own ignorance and want of courtesy.\"\n\"What discourtesy, Chieftain, hast thou seen in me?\"  \"Greater\ndiscourtesy saw I never in man,\" said he, \"than to drive away the\ndogs that were killing the stag and to set upon it thine own.  This\nwas discourteous, and though I may not be revenged upon thee, yet I\ndeclare to Heaven that I will do thee more dishonour than the value\nof an hundred stags.\"  \"O Chieftain,\" he replied, \"if I have done ill\nI will redeem thy friendship.\"  \"How wilt thou redeem it?\"\n\"According as thy dignity may be, but I know not who thou art?\"  \"A\ncrowned king am I in the land whence I come.\"  \"Lord,\" said he, \"may\nthe day prosper with thee, and from what land comest thou?\"  \"From\nAnnwvyn,\" {2} answered he; \"Arawn, a King of Annwvyn, am I.\"  \"Lord,\"\nsaid he, \"how may I gain thy friendship?\"  \"After this manner mayest\nthou,\" he said.  \"There is a man whose dominions are opposite to\nmine, who is ever warring against me, and he is Havgan, a King of\nAnnwvyn, and by ridding me of this oppression, which thou canst\neasily do, shalt thou gain my friendship.\"  \"Gladly will I do this,\"\nsaid he.  \"Show me how I may.\"  \"I will show thee.  Behold thus it is\nthou mayest.  I will make firm friendship with thee; and this will I\ndo.  I will send thee to Annwvyn in my stead, and I will give thee\nthe fairest lady thou didst ever behold to be thy companion, and I\nwill put my form and semblance upon thee, so that not a page of the\nchamber, nor an officer, nor any other man that has always followed\nme shall know that it is not I.  And this shall be for the space of a\nyear from to-morrow, and then we will meet in this place.\"  \"Yes,\"\nsaid he; \"but when I shall have been there for the space of a year,\nby what means shall I discover him of whom thou speakest?\"  \"One year\nfrom this night,\" he answered, \"is the time fixed between him and me\nthat we should meet at the Ford; be thou there in my likeness, and\nwith one stroke that thou givest him, he shall no longer live.  And\nif he ask thee to give him another, give it not, how much soever he\nmay entreat thee, for when I did so, he fought with me next day as\nwell as ever before.\"  \"Verily,\" said Pwyll, \"what shall I do\nconcerning my kingdom?\"  Said Arawn, \"I will cause that no one in all\nthy dominions, neither man nor woman, shall know that I am not thou,\nand I will go there in thy stead.\"  \"Gladly then,\" said Pwyll, \"will\nI set forward.\"  \"Clear shall be thy path, and nothing shall detain\nthee, until thou come into my dominions, and I myself will be thy\nguide!\"\n\nSo he conducted him until he came in sight of the palace and its\ndwellings.  \"Behold,\" said he, \"the Court and the kingdom in thy\npower.  Enter the Court, there is no one there who will know thee,\nand when thou seest what service is done there, thou wilt know the\ncustoms of the Court.\"\n\nSo he went forward to the Court, and when he came there, he beheld\nsleeping-rooms, and halls, and chambers, and the most beautiful\nbuildings ever seen.  And he went into the hall to disarray, and\nthere came youths and pages and disarrayed him, and all as they\nentered saluted him.  And two knights came and drew his hunting-dress\nfrom about him, and clothed him in a vesture of silk and gold.  And\nthe hall was prepared, and behold he saw the household and the host\nenter in, and the host was the most comely and the best equipped that\nhe had ever seen.  And with them came in likewise the Queen, who was\nthe fairest woman that he had ever yet beheld.  And she had on a\nyellow robe of shining satin; and they washed and went to the table,\nand sat, the Queen upon one side of him, and one who seemed to be an\nEarl on the other side.\n\nAnd he began to speak with the Queen, and he thought, from her\nspeech, that she was the seemliest and most noble lady of converse\nand of cheer that ever was.  And they partook of meat, and drink,\nwith songs and with feasting; and of all the Courts upon the earth,\nbehold this was the best supplied with food and drink, and vessels of\ngold and royal jewels.\n\n\nAnd the year he spent in hunting, and minstrelsy, and feasting, and\ndiversions, and discourse with his companions until the night that\nwas fixed for the conflict.  And when that night came, it was\nremembered even by those who lived in the furthest part of his\ndominions, and he went to the meeting, and the nobles of the kingdom\nwith him.  And when he came to the Ford, a knight arose and spake\nthus.  \"Lords,\" said he, \"listen well.  It is between two kings that\nthis meeting is, and between them only.  Each claimeth of the other\nhis land and territory, and do all of you stand aside and leave the\nfight to be between them.\"\n\nThereupon the two kings approached each other in the middle of the\nFord, and encountered, and at the first thrust, the man who was in\nthe stead of Arawn struck Havgan on the centre of the boss of his\nshield, so that it was cloven in twain, and his armour was broken,\nand Havgan himself was borne to the ground an arm's and a spear's\nlength over the crupper of his horse, and he received a deadly blow.\n\"O Chieftain,\" said Havgan, \"what right hast thou to cause my death?\nI was not injuring thee in anything, and I know not wherefore thou\nwouldest slay me.  But, for the love of Heaven, since thou hast begun\nto slay me, complete thy work.\"  \"Ah, Chieftain,\" he replied, \"I may\nyet repent doing that unto thee, slay thee who may, I will not do\nso.\"  \"My trusty Lords,\" said Havgan, \"bear me hence.  My death has\ncome.  I shall be no more able to uphold you.\"  \"My Nobles,\" also\nsaid he who was in the semblance of Arawn, \"take counsel and know who\nought to be my subjects.\"  \"Lord,\" said the Nobles, \"all should be,\nfor there is no king over the whole of Annwvyn but thee.\"  \"Yes,\" he\nreplied, \"it is right that he who comes humbly should be received\ngraciously, but he that doth not come with obedience, shall be\ncompelled by the force of swords.\"  And thereupon he received the\nhomage of the men, and he began to conquer the country; and the next\nday by noon the two kingdoms were in his power.  And thereupon he\nwent to keep his tryst, and came to Glyn Cuch.\n\nAnd when he came there, the King of Annwvyn was there to meet him,\nand each of them was rejoiced to see the other.  \"Verily,\" said\nArawn, \"may Heaven reward thee for thy friendship towards me.  I have\nheard of it.  When thou comest thyself to thy dominions,\" said he,\n\"thou wilt see that which I have done for thee.\"  \"Whatever thou hast\ndone for me, may Heaven repay it thee.\"\n\nThen Arawn gave to Pwyll Prince of Dyved his proper form and\nsemblance, and he himself took his own; and Arawn set forth towards\nthe Court of Annwvyn; and he was rejoiced when he beheld his hosts,\nand his household, whom he had not seen so long; but they had not\nknown of his absence, and wondered no more at his coming than usual.\nAnd that day was spent in joy and merriment; and he sat and conversed\nwith his wife and his nobles.  And when it was time for them rather\nto sleep than to carouse, they went to rest.\n\n\nPwyll Prince of Dyved came likewise to his country and dominions, and\nbegan to inquire of the nobles of the land, how his rule had been\nduring the past year, compared with what it had been before.  \"Lord,\"\nsaid they, \"thy wisdom was never so great, and thou wast never so\nkind or so free in bestowing thy gifts, and thy justice was never\nmore worthily seen than in this year.\"  \"By Heaven,\" said he, \"for\nall the good you have enjoyed, you should thank him who hath been\nwith you; for behold, thus hath this matter been.\"  And thereupon\nPwyll related the whole unto them.  \"Verily, Lord,\" said they,\n\"render thanks unto Heaven that thou hast such a fellowship, and\nwithhold not from us the rule which we have enjoyed for this year\npast.\"  \"I take Heaven to witness that I will not withhold it,\"\nanswered Pwyll.\n\nAnd thenceforth they made strong the friendship that was between\nthem, and each sent unto the other horses, and greyhounds, and hawks,\nand all such jewels as they thought would be pleasing to each other.\nAnd by reason of his having dwelt that year in Annwvyn, and having\nruled there so prosperously, and united the two kingdoms in one day\nby his valour and prowess, he lost the name of Pwyll Prince of Dyved,\nand was called Pwyll Chief of Annwvyn from that time forward.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, Pwyll was at Narberth his chief palace, where a\nfeast had been prepared for him, and with him was a great host of\nmen.  And after the first meal, Pwyll arose to walk, and he went to\nthe top of a mound that was above the palace, and was called Gorsedd\nArberth.  \"Lord,\" said one of the Court, \"it is peculiar to the mound\nthat whosoever sits upon it cannot go thence, without either\nreceiving wounds or blows, or else seeing a wonder.\"  \"I fear not to\nreceive wounds and blows in the midst of such a host as this, but as\nto the wonder, gladly would I see it.  I will go therefore and sit\nupon the mound.\"\n\nAnd upon the mound he sat.  And while he sat there, they saw a lady,\non a pure white horse of large size, with a garment of shining gold\naround her, coming along the highway that led from the mound; and the\nhorse seemed to move at a slow and even pace, and to be coming up\ntowards the mound.  \"My men,\" said Pwyll, \"is there any among you who\nknows yonder lady?\"  \"There is not, Lord,\" said they.  \"Go one of you\nand meet her, that we may know who she is.\"  And one of them arose,\nand as he came upon the road to meet her, she passed by, and he\nfollowed as fast as he could, being on foot; and the greater was his\nspeed, the further was she from him.  And when he saw that it\nprofited him nothing to follow her, he returned to Pwyll, and said\nunto him, \"Lord, it is idle for any one in the world to follow her on\nfoot.\"  \"Verily,\" said Pwyll, \"go unto the palace, and take the\nfleetest horse that thou seest, and go after her.\"\n\nAnd he took a horse and went forward.  And he came to an open level\nplain, and put spurs to his horse; and the more he urged his horse,\nthe further was she from him.  Yet she held the same pace as at\nfirst.  And his horse began to fail; and when his horse's feet failed\nhim, he returned to the place where Pwyll was.  \"Lord,\" said he, \"it\nwill avail nothing for any one to follow yonder lady.  I know of no\nhorse in these realms swifter than this, and it availed me not to\npursue her.\"  \"Of a truth,\" said Pwyll, \"there must be some illusion\nhere.  Let us go towards the palace.\"  So to the palace they went,\nand they spent that day.  And the next day they arose, and that also\nthey spent until it was time to go to meat.  And after the first\nmeal, \"Verily,\" said Pwyll, \"we will go the same party as yesterday\nto the top of the mound.  And do thou,\" said he to one of his young\nmen, \"take the swiftest horse that thou knowest in the field.\"  And\nthus did the young man.  And they went towards the mound, taking the\nhorse with them.  And as they were sitting down they beheld the lady\non the same horse, and in the same apparel, coming along the same\nroad.  \"Behold,\" said Pwyll, \"here is the lady of yesterday.  Make\nready, youth, to learn who she is.\"  \"My lord,\" said he, \"that will I\ngladly do.\"  And thereupon the lady came opposite to them.  So the\nyouth mounted his horse; and before he had settled himself in his\nsaddle, she passed by, and there was a clear space between them.  But\nher speed was no greater than it had been the day before.  Then he\nput his horse into an amble, and thought that notwithstanding the\ngentle pace at which his horse went, he should soon overtake her.\nBut this availed him not; so he gave his horse the reins.  And still\nhe came no nearer to her than when he went at a foot's pace.  And the\nmore he urged his horse, the further was she from him.  Yet she rode\nnot faster than before.  When he saw that it availed not to follow\nher, he returned to the place where Pwyll was.  \"Lord,\" said he, \"the\nhorse can no more than thou hast seen.\"  \"I see indeed that it avails\nnot that any one should follow her.  And by Heaven,\" said he, \"she\nmust needs have an errand to some one in this plain, if her haste\nwould allow her to declare it.  Let us go back to the palace.\"  And\nto the palace they went, and they spent that night in songs and\nfeasting, as it pleased them.\n\nAnd the next day they amused themselves until it was time to go to\nmeat.  And when meat was ended, Pwyll said, \"Where are the hosts that\nwent yesterday and the day before to the top of the mound?\"  \"Behold,\nLord, we are here,\" said they.  \"Let us go,\" said he, \"to the mound,\nto sit there.  And do thou,\" said he to the page who tended his\nhorse, \"saddle my horse well, and hasten with him to the road, and\nbring also my spurs with thee.\"  And the youth did thus.  And they\nwent and sat upon the mound; and ere they had been there but a short\ntime, they beheld the lady coming by the same road, and in the same\nmanner, and at the same pace.  \"Young man,\" said Pwyll, \"I see the\nlady coming; give me my horse.\"  And no sooner had he mounted his\nhorse than she passed him.  And he turned after her and followed her.\nAnd he let his horse go bounding playfully, and thought that at the\nsecond step or the third he should come up with her.  But he came no\nnearer to her than at first.  Then he urged his horse to his utmost\nspeed, yet he found that it availed nothing to follow her.  Then said\nPwyll, \"O maiden, for the sake of him whom thou best lovest, stay for\nme.\"  \"I will stay gladly,\" said she, \"and it were better for thy\nhorse hadst thou asked it long since.\"  So the maiden stopped, and\nshe threw back that part of her headdress which covered her face.\nAnd she fixed her eyes upon him, and began to talk with him.  \"Lady,\"\nasked he, \"whence comest thou, and whereunto dost thou journey?\"  \"I\njourney on mine own errand,\" said she, \"and right glad am I to see\nthee.\"  \"My greeting be unto thee,\" said he.  Then he thought that\nthe beauty of all the maidens, and all the ladies that he had ever\nseen, was as nothing compared to her beauty.  \"Lady,\" he said, \"wilt\nthou tell me aught concerning thy purpose?\"  \"I will tell thee,\" said\nshe.  \"My chief quest was to seek thee.\"  \"Behold,\" said Pwyll, \"this\nis to me the most pleasing quest on which thou couldst have come; and\nwilt thou tell me who thou art?\"  \"I will tell thee, Lord,\" said she.\n\"I am Rhiannon, the daughter of Heveydd Hen, and they sought to give\nme to a husband against my will.  But no husband would I have, and\nthat because of my love for thee, neither will I yet have one unless\nthou reject me.  And hither have I come to hear thy answer.\"  \"By\nHeaven,\" said Pwyll, \"behold this is my answer.  If I might choose\namong all the ladies and damsels in the world, thee would I choose.\"\n\"Verily,\" said she, \"if thou art thus minded, make a pledge to meet\nme ere I am given to another.\"  \"The sooner I may do so, the more\npleasing will it be unto me,\" said Pwyll, \"and wheresoever thou wilt,\nthere will I meet with thee.\"  \"I will that thou meet me this day\ntwelvemonth at the palace of Heveydd.  And I will cause a feast to be\nprepared, so that it be ready against thou come.\"  \"Gladly,\" said he,\n\"will I keep this tryst.\"  \"Lord,\" said she, \"remain in health, and\nbe mindful that thou keep thy promise; and now I will go hence.\"  So\nthey parted, and he went back to his hosts and to them of his\nhousehold.  And whatsoever questions they asked him respecting the\ndamsel, he always turned the discourse upon other matters.  And when\na year from that time was gone, he caused a hundred knights to equip\nthemselves and to go with him to the palace of Heveydd Hen.  And he\ncame to the palace, and there was great joy concerning him, with much\nconcourse of people and great rejoicing, and vast preparations for\nhis coming.  And the whole Court was placed under his orders.\n\nAnd the hall was garnished and they went to meat, and thus did they\nsit; Heveydd Hen was on one side of Pwyll, and Rhiannon on the other.\nAnd all the rest according to their rank.  And they ate and feasted\nand talked one with another, and at the beginning of the carousal\nafter the meat, there entered a tall auburn-haired youth, of royal\nbearing, clothed in a garment of satin.  And when he came into the\nhall, he saluted Pwyll and his companions.  \"The greeting of Heaven\nbe unto thee, my soul,\" said Pwyll, \"come thou and sit down.\"  \"Nay,\"\nsaid he, \"a suitor am I, and I will do mine errand.\"  \"Do so\nwillingly,\" said Pwyll.  \"Lord,\" said he, \"my errand is unto thee,\nand it is to crave a boon of thee that I come.\"  \"What boon soever\nthou mayest ask of me, as far as I am able, thou shalt have.\"  \"Ah,\"\nsaid Rhiannon, \"wherefore didst thou give that answer?\"  \"Has he not\ngiven it before the presence of these nobles?\" asked the youth.  \"My\nsoul,\" said Pwyll, \"what is the boon thou askest?\"  \"The lady whom\nbest I love is to be thy bride this night; I come to ask her of thee,\nwith the feast and the banquet that are in this place.\"  And Pwyll\nwas silent because of the answer which he had given.  \"Be silent as\nlong as thou wilt,\" said Rhiannon.  \"Never did man make worse use of\nhis wits than thou hast done.\"  \"Lady,\" said he, \"I knew not who he\nwas.\"  \"Behold this is the man to whom they would have given me\nagainst my will,\" said she.  \"And he is Gwawl the son of Clud, a man\nof great power and wealth, and because of the word thou hast spoken,\nbestow me upon him lest shame befall thee.\"  \"Lady,\" said he, \"I\nunderstand not thine answer.  Never can I do as thou sayest.\"\n\"Bestow me upon him,\" said she, \"and I will cause that I shall never\nbe his.\"  \"By what means will that be?\" asked Pwyll.  \"In thy hand\nwill I give thee a small bag,\" said she.  \"See that thou keep it\nwell, and he will ask of thee the banquet, and the feast, and the\npreparations which are not in thy power.  Unto the hosts and the\nhousehold will I give the feast.  And such will be thy answer\nrespecting this.  And as concerns myself, I will engage to become his\nbride this night twelvemonth.  And at the end of the year be thou\nhere,\" said she, \"and bring this bag with thee, and let thy hundred\nknights be in the orchard up yonder.  And when he is in the midst of\njoy and feasting, come thou in by thyself, clad in ragged garments,\nand holding thy bag in thy hand, and ask nothing but a bagful of\nfood, and I will cause that if all the meat and liquor that are in\nthese seven Cantrevs were put into it, it would be no fuller than\nbefore.  And after a great deal has been put therein, he will ask\nthee whether thy bag will ever be full.  Say thou then that it never\nwill, until a man of noble birth and of great wealth arise and press\nthe food in the bag with both his feet, saying, 'Enough has been put\ntherein;' and I will cause him to go and tread down the food in the\nbag, and when he does so, turn thou the bag, so that he shall be up\nover his head in it, and then slip a knot upon the thongs of the bag.\nLet there be also a good bugle horn about thy neck, and as soon as\nthou hast bound him in the bag, wind thy horn, and let it be a signal\nbetween thee and thy knights.  And when they hear the sound of the\nhorn, let them come down upon the palace.\"  \"Lord,\" said Gwawl, \"it\nis meet that I have an answer to my request.\"  \"As much of that thou\nhast asked as it is in my power to give, thou shalt have,\" replied\nPwyll.  \"My soul,\" said Rhiannon unto him, \"as for the feast and the\nbanquet that are here, I have bestowed them upon the men of Dyved,\nand the household, and the warriors that are with us.  These can I\nnot suffer to be given to any.  In a year from to-night a banquet\nshall be prepared for thee in this palace, that I may become thy\nbride.\"\n\nSo Gwawl went forth to his possessions, and Pwyll went also back to\nDyved.  And they both spent that year until it was the time for the\nfeast at the palace of Heveydd Hen.  Then Gwawl the son of Clud set\nout to the feast that was prepared for him, and he came to the\npalace, and was received there with rejoicing.  Pwyll, also, the\nChief of Annwvyn, came to the orchard with his hundred knights, as\nRhiannon had commanded him, having the bag with him.  And Pwyll was\nclad in coarse and ragged garments, and wore large clumsy old shoes\nupon his feet.  And when he knew that the carousal after the meat had\nbegun, he went towards the hall, and when he came into the hall, he\nsaluted Gwawl the son of Clud, and his company, both men and women.\n\"Heaven prosper thee,\" said Gwawl, \"and the greeting of Heaven be\nunto thee.\"  \"Lord,\" said he, \"may Heaven reward thee, I have an\nerrand unto thee.\"  \"Welcome be thine errand, and if thou ask of me\nthat which is just, thou shalt have it gladly.\"  \"It is fitting,\"\nanswered he.  \"I crave but from want, and the boon that I ask is to\nhave this small bag that thou seest filled with meat.\"  \"A request\nwithin reason is this,\" said he, \"and gladly shalt thou have it.\nBring him food.\"  A great number of attendants arose and began to\nfill the bag, but for all that they put into it, it was no fuller\nthan at first.  \"My soul,\" said Gwawl, \"will thy bag be ever full?\"\n\"It will not, I declare to Heaven,\" said he, \"for all that may be put\ninto it, unless one possessed of lands, and domains, and treasure,\nshall arise and tread down with both his feet the food that is within\nthe bag, and shall say, 'Enough has been put therein.'\"  Then said\nRhiannon unto Gwawl the son of Clud, \"Rise up quickly.\"  \"I will\nwillingly arise,\" said he.  So he rose up, and put his two feet into\nthe bag.  And Pwyll turned up the sides of the bag, so that Gwawl was\nover his head in it.  And he shut it up quickly and slipped a knot\nupon the thongs, and blew his horn.  And thereupon behold his\nhousehold came down upon the palace.  And they seized all the host\nthat had come with Gwawl, and cast them into his own prison.  And\nPwyll threw off his rags, and his old shoes, and his tattered array;\nand as they came in, every one of Pwyll's knights struck a blow upon\nthe bag, and asked, \"What is here?\"  \"A Badger,\" said they.  And in\nthis manner they played, each of them striking the bag, either with\nhis foot or with a staff.  And thus played they with the bag.  Every\none as he came in asked, \"What game are you playing at thus?\"  \"The\ngame of Badger in the Bag,\" said they.  And then was the game of\nBadger in the Bag first played.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man in the bag, \"if thou wouldest but hear me, I\nmerit not to be slain in a bag.\"  Said Heveydd Hen, \"Lord, he speaks\ntruth.  It were fitting that thou listen to him, for he deserves not\nthis.\"  \"Verily,\" said Pwyll, \"I will do thy counsel concerning him.\"\n\"Behold this is my counsel then,\" said Rhiannon; \"thou art now in a\nposition in which it behoves thee to satisfy suitors and minstrels;\nlet him give unto them in thy stead, and take a pledge from him that\nhe will never seek to revenge that which has been done to him.  And\nthis will be punishment enough.\"  \"I will do this gladly,\" said the\nman in the bag.  \"And gladly will I accept it,\" said Pwyll, \"since it\nis the counsel of Heveydd and Rhiannon.\"  \"Such then is our counsel,\"\nanswered they.  \"I accept it,\" said Pwyll.  \"Seek thyself sureties.\"\n\"We will be for him,\" said Heveydd, \"until his men be free to answer\nfor him.\"  And upon this he was let out of the bag, and his liegemen\nwere liberated.  \"Demand now of Gwawl his sureties,\" said Heveydd,\n\"we know which should be taken for him.\"  And Heveydd numbered the\nsureties.  Said Gwawl, \"Do thou thyself draw up the covenant.\"  \"It\nwill suffice me that it be as Rhiannon said,\" answered Pwyll.  So\nunto that covenant were the sureties pledged.  \"Verily, Lord,\" said\nGwawl, \"I am greatly hurt, and I have many bruises.  I have need to\nbe anointed; with thy leave I will go forth.  I will leave nobles in\nmy stead, to answer for me in all that thou shalt require.\"\n\"Willingly,\" said Pwyll, \"mayest thou do thus.\"  So Gwawl went\ntowards his own possessions.\n\nAnd the hall was set in order for Pwyll and the men of his host, and\nfor them also of the palace, and they went to the tables and sat\ndown.  And as they had sat that time twelvemonth, so sat they that\nnight.  And they ate, and feasted, and spent the night in mirth and\ntranquillity.  And the time came that they should sleep, and Pwyll\nand Rhiannon went to their chamber.\n\nAnd next morning at the break of day, \"My Lord,\" said Rhiannon,\n\"arise and begin to give thy gifts unto the minstrels.  Refuse no one\nto-day that may claim thy bounty.\"  \"Thus shall it be gladly,\" said\nPwyll, \"both to-day and every day while the feast shall last.\"  So\nPwyll arose, and he caused silence to be proclaimed, and desired all\nthe suitors and the minstrels to show and to point out what gifts\nwere to their wish and desire.  And this being done, the feast went\non, and he denied no one while it lasted.  And when the feast was\nended, Pwyll said unto Heveydd, \"My Lord, with thy permission I will\nset out for Dyved to-morrow.\"  \"Certainly,\" said Heveydd, \"may Heaven\nprosper thee.  Fix also a time when Rhiannon may follow thee.\"  \"By\nHeaven,\" said Pwyll, \"we will go hence together.\"  \"Willest thou\nthis, Lord?\" said Heveydd.  \"Yes, by Heaven,\" answered Pwyll.\n\nAnd the next day, they set forward towards Dyved, and journeyed to\nthe palace of Narberth, where a feast was made ready for them.  And\nthere came to them great numbers of the chief men and the most noble\nladies of the land, and of these there was none to whom Rhiannon did\nnot give some rich gift, either a bracelet, or a ring, or a precious\nstone.  And they ruled the land prosperously both that year and the\nnext.\n\nAnd in the third year the nobles of the land began to be sorrowful at\nseeing a man whom they loved so much, and who was moreover their lord\nand their foster-brother, without an heir.  And they came to him.\nAnd the place where they met was Preseleu, in Dyved.  \"Lord,\" said\nthey, \"we know that thou art not so young as some of the men of this\ncountry, and we fear that thou mayest not have an heir of the wife\nwhom thou hast taken.  Take therefore another wife of whom thou\nmayest have heirs.  Thou canst not always continue with us, and\nthough thou desire to remain as thou art, we will not suffer thee.\"\n\"Truly,\" said Pwyll, \"we have not long been joined together, and many\nthings may yet befall.  Grant me a year from this time, and for the\nspace of a year we will abide together, and after that I will do\naccording to your wishes.  So they granted it.  And before the end of\na year a son was born unto him.  And in Narberth was he born; and on\nthe night that he was born, women were brought to watch the mother\nand the boy.  And the women slept, as did also Rhiannon, the mother\nof the boy.  And the number of the women that were brought into the\nchamber was six.  And they watched for a good portion of the night,\nand before midnight every one of them fell asleep, and towards break\nof day they awoke; and when they awoke, they looked where they had\nput the boy, and behold he was not there.  \"Oh,\" said one of the\nwomen, \"the boy is lost?\"  \"Yes,\" said another, \"and it will be small\nvengeance if we are burnt or put to death because of the child.\"\nSaid one of the women, \"Is there any counsel for us in the world in\nthis matter?\"  \"There is,\" answered another, \"I offer you good\ncounsel.\"  \"What is that?\" asked they.  \"There is here a stag-hound\nbitch, and she has a litter of whelps.  Let us kill some of the cubs,\nand rub the blood on the face and hands of Rhiannon, and lay the\nbones before her, and assert that she herself hath devoured her son,\nand she alone will not be able to gainsay us six.\"  And according to\nthis counsel it was settled.  And towards morning Rhiannon awoke, and\nshe said, \"Women, where is my son?\"  \"Lady,\" said they, \"ask us not\nconcerning thy son, we have nought but the blows and the bruises we\ngot by struggling with thee, and of a truth we never saw any woman so\nviolent as thou, for it was of no avail to contend with thee.  Hast\nthou not thyself devoured thy son?  Claim him not therefore of us.\"\n\"For pity's sake,\" said Rhiannon; \"the Lord God knows all things.\nCharge me not falsely.  If you tell me this from fear, I assert\nbefore Heaven that I will defend you.\"  \"Truly,\" said they, \"we would\nnot bring evil on ourselves for any one in the world.\"  \"For pity's\nsake,\" said Rhiannon, \"you will receive no evil by telling the\ntruth.\"  But for all her words, whether fair or harsh, she received\nbut the same answer from the women.\n\nAnd Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn arose, and his household, and his\nhosts.  And this occurrence could not be concealed, but the story\nwent forth throughout the land, and all the nobles heard it.  Then\nthe nobles came to Pwyll, and besought him to put away his wife,\nbecause of the great crime which she had done.  But Pwyll answered\nthem, that they had no cause wherefore they might ask him to put away\nhis wife, save for her having no children.  \"But children has she now\nhad, therefore will I not put her away; if she has done wrong, let\nher do penance for it.\"\n\nSo Rhiannon sent for the teachers and the wise men, and as she\npreferred doing penance to contending with the women, she took upon\nher a penance.  And the penance that was imposed upon her was, that\nshe should remain in that palace of Narberth until the end of seven\nyears, and that she should sit every day near unto a horseblock that\nwas without the gate.  And that she should relate the story to all\nwho should come there, whom she might suppose not to know it already;\nand that she should offer the guests and strangers, if they would\npermit her, to carry them upon her back into the palace.  But it\nrarely happened that any would permit.  And thus did she spend part\nof the year.\n\nNow at that time Teirnyon Twryv Vliant was Lord of Gwent Is Coed, and\nhe was the best man in the world.  And unto his house there belonged\na mare, than which neither mare nor horse in the kingdom was more\nbeautiful.  And on the night of every first of May she foaled, and no\none ever knew what became of the colt.  And one night Teirnyon talked\nwith his wife:  \"Wife,\" said he, \"it is very simple of us that our\nmare should foal every year, and that we should have none of her\ncolts.\"  \"What can be done in the matter?\" said she.  \"This is the\nnight of the first of May,\" said he.  \"The vengeance of Heaven be\nupon me, if I learn not what it is that takes away the colts.\"  So he\ncaused the mare to be brought into a house, and he armed himself, and\nbegan to watch that night.  And in the beginning of the night, the\nmare foaled a large and beautiful colt.  And it was standing up in\nthe place.  And Teirnyon rose up and looked at the size of the colt,\nand as he did so he heard a great tumult, and after the tumult behold\na claw came through the window into the house, and it seized the colt\nby the mane.  Then Teirnyon drew his sword, and struck off the arm at\nthe elbow, so that portion of the arm together with the colt was in\nthe house with him.  And then did he hear a tumult and wailing, both\nat once.  And he opened the door, and rushed out in the direction of\nthe noise, and he could not see the cause of the tumult because of\nthe darkness of the night, but he rushed after it and followed it.\nThen he remembered that he had left the door open, and he returned.\nAnd at the door behold there was an infant boy in swaddling-clothes,\nwrapped around in a mantle of satin.  And he took up the boy, and\nbehold he was very strong for the age that he was of.\n\nThen he shut the door, and went into the chamber where his wife was.\n\"Lady,\" said he, \"art thou sleeping?\"  \"No, lord,\" said she, \"I was\nasleep, but as thou camest in I did awake.\"  \"Behold, here is a boy\nfor thee if thou wilt,\" said he, \"since thou hast never had one.\"\n\"My lord,\" said she, \"what adventure is this?\"  \"It was thus,\" said\nTeirnyon; and he told her how it all befell.  \"Verily, lord,\" said\nshe, \"what sort of garments are there upon the boy?\"  \"A mantle of\nsatin,\" said he.  \"He is then a boy of gentle lineage,\" she replied.\n\"My lord,\" she said, \"if thou wilt, I shall have great diversion and\nmirth.  I will call my women unto me, and tell them that I have been\npregnant.\"  \"I will readily grant thee to do this,\" he answered.  And\nthus did they, and they caused the boy to be baptized, and the\nceremony was performed there; and the name which they gave unto him\nwas Gwri Wallt Euryn, because what hair was upon his head was as\nyellow as gold.  And they had the boy nursed in the Court until he\nwas a year old.  And before the year was over he could walk stoutly.\nAnd he was larger than a boy of three years old, even one of great\ngrowth and size.  And the boy was nursed the second year, and then he\nwas as large as a child six years old.  And before the end of the\nfourth year, he would bribe the grooms to allow him to take the\nhorses to water.  \"My lord,\" said his wife unto Teirnyon, \"where is\nthe colt which thou didst save on the night that thou didst find the\nboy?\"  \"I have commanded the grooms of the horses,\" said he, \"that\nthey take care of him.\"  \"Would it not be well, lord,\" said she, \"if\nthou wert to cause him to be broken in, and given to the boy, seeing\nthat on the same night that thou didst find the boy, the colt was\nfoaled and thou didst save him?\"  \"I will not oppose thee in this\nmatter,\" said Teirnyon.  \"I will allow thee to give him the colt.\"\n\"Lord,\" said she, \"may Heaven reward thee; I will give it him.\"  So\nthe horse was given to the boy.  Then she went to the grooms and\nthose who tended the horses, and commanded them to be careful of the\nhorse, so that he might be broken in by the time that the boy could\nride him.\n\nAnd while these things were going forward, they heard tidings of\nRhiannon and her punishment.  And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant, by reason of\nthe pity that he felt on hearing this story of Rhiannon and her\npunishment, inquired closely concerning it, until he had heard from\nmany of those who came to his court.  Then did Teirnyon, often\nlamenting the sad history, ponder within himself, and he looked\nsteadfastly on the boy, and as he looked upon him, it seemed to him\nthat he had never beheld so great a likeness between father and son,\nas between the boy and Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn.  Now the semblance\nof Pwyll was well known to him, for he had of yore been one of his\nfollowers.  And thereupon he became grieved for the wrong that he\ndid, in keeping with him a boy whom he knew to be the son of another\nman.  And the first time that he was alone with his wife, he told her\nthat it was not right that they should keep the boy with them, and\nsuffer so excellent a lady as Rhiannon to be punished so greatly on\nhis account, whereas the boy was the son of Pwyll the Chief of\nAnnwvyn.  And Teirnyon's wife agreed with him, that they should send\nthe boy to Pwyll.  \"And three things, lord,\" said she, \"shall we gain\nthereby.  Thanks and gifts for releasing Rhiannon from her\npunishment; and thanks from Pwyll for nursing his son and restoring\nhim unto him; and thirdly, if the boy is of gentle nature, he will be\nour foster-son, and he will do for us all the good in his power.\"  So\nit was settled according to this counsel.\n\nAnd no later than the next day was Teirnyon equipped, and two other\nknights with him.  And the boy, as a fourth in their company, went\nwith them upon the horse which Teirnyon had given him.  And they\njourneyed towards Narberth, and it was not long before they reached\nthat place.  And as they drew near to the palace, they beheld\nRhiannon sitting beside the horseblock.  And when they were opposite\nto her, \"Chieftain,\" said she, \"go not further thus, I will bear\nevery one of you into the palace, and this is my penance for slaying\nmy own son and devouring him.\"  \"Oh, fair lady,\" said Teirnyon,\n\"think not that I will be one to be carried upon thy back.\"  \"Neither\nwill I,\" said the boy.  \"Truly, my soul,\" said Teirnyon, \"we will not\ngo.\"  So they went forward to the palace, and there was great joy at\ntheir coming.  And at the palace a feast was prepared, because Pywll\nwas come back from the confines of Dyved.  And they went into the\nhall and washed, and Pwyll rejoiced to see Teirnyon.  And in this\norder they sat.  Teirnyon between Pwyll and Rhiannon, and Teirnyon's\ntwo companions on the other side of Pwyll, with the boy between them.\nAnd after meat they began to carouse and to discourse.  And\nTeirnyon's discourse was concerning the adventure of the mare and the\nboy, and how he and his wife had nursed and reared the child as their\nown.  \"And behold here is thy son, lady,\" said Teirnyon.  \"And\nwhosoever told that lie concerning thee, has done wrong.  And when I\nheard of thy sorrow, I was troubled and grieved.  And I believe that\nthere is none of this host who will not perceive that the boy is the\nson of Pwyll,\" said Teirnyon.  \"There is none,\" said they all, \"who\nis not certain thereof.\"  \"I declare to Heaven,\" said Rhiannon, \"that\nif this be true, there is indeed an end to my trouble.\"  \"Lady,\" said\nPendaran Dyved, \"well hast thou named thy son Pryderi, {3} and well\nbecomes him the name of Pryderi son of Pwyll Chief of Annwvyn.\"\n\"Look you,\" said Rhiannon, \"will not his own name become him better?\"\n\"What name has he?\" asked Pendaran Dyved.  \"Gwri Wallt Euryn is the\nname that we gave him.\"  \"Pryderi,\" said Pendaran, \"shall his name\nbe.\"  \"It were more proper,\" said Pwyll, \"that the boy should take\nhis name from the word his mother spoke when she received the joyful\ntidings of him.\"  And thus was it arranged.\n\n\"Teirnyon,\" said Pwyll, \"Heaven reward thee that thou hast reared the\nboy up to this time, and, being of gentle lineage, it were fitting\nthat he repay thee for it.\"  \"My lord,\" said Teirnyon, \"it was my\nwife who nursed him, and there is no one in the world so afflicted as\nshe at parting with him.  It were well that he should bear in mind\nwhat I and my wife have done for him.\"  \"I call Heaven to witness,\"\nsaid Pwyll, \"that while I live I will support thee and thy\npossessions, as long as I am able to preserve my own.  And when he\nshall have power, he will more fitly maintain them than I.  And if\nthis counsel be pleasing unto thee, and to my nobles, it shall be\nthat, as thou hast reared him up to the present time, I will give him\nto be brought up by Pendaran Dyved, from henceforth.  And you shall\nbe companions, and shall both be foster-fathers unto him.\"  \"This is\ngood counsel,\" said they all.  So the boy was given to Pendaran\nDyved, and the nobles of the land were sent with him.  And Teirnyon\nTwryv Vliant, and his companions, set out for his country, and his\npossessions, with love and gladness.  And he went not without being\noffered the fairest jewels and the fairest horses, and the choicest\ndogs; but he would take none of them.\n\nThereupon they all remained in their own dominions.  And Pryderi, the\nson of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn, was brought up carefully as was\nfit, so that he became the fairest youth, and the most comely, and\nthe best skilled in all good games, of any in the kingdom.  And thus\npassed years and years, until the end of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn's\nlife came, and he died.\n\nAnd Pryderi ruled the seven Cantrevs of Dyved prosperously, and he\nwas beloved by his people, and by all around him.  And at length he\nadded unto them the three Cantrevs of Ystrad Tywi, and the four\nCantrevs of Cardigan; and these were called the Seven Cantrevs of\nSeissyllwch.  And when he made this addition, Pryderi the son of\nPwyll the Chief of Annwvyn desired to take a wife.  And the wife he\nchose was Kicva, the daughter of Gwynn Gohoyw, the son of Gloyw Wallt\nLydan, the son of Prince Casnar, one of the nobles of this Island.\n\nAnd thus ends this portion of the Mabinogion.\n\n\n\nBRANWEN THE DAUGHTER OF LLYR\nHERE IS THE SECOND PORTION OF THE MABINOGI\n\n\n\nBendigeid Vran, the son of Llyr, was the crowned king of this island,\nand he was exalted from the crown of London.  And one afternoon he\nwas at Harlech in Ardudwy, at his Court, and he sat upon the rock of\nHarlech, looking over the sea.  And with him were his brother\nManawyddan the son of Llyr, and his brothers by the mother's side,\nNissyen and Evnissyen, and many nobles likewise, as was fitting to\nsee around a king.  His two brothers by the mother's side were the\nsons of Eurosswydd, by his mother, Penardun, the daughter of Beli son\nof Manogan.  And one of these youths was a good youth and of gentle\nnature, and would make peace between his kindred, and cause his\nfamily to be friends when their wrath was at the highest; and this\none was Nissyen; but the other would cause strife between his two\nbrothers when they were most at peace.  And as they sat thus, they\nbeheld thirteen ships coming from the south of Ireland, and making\ntowards them, and they came with a swift motion, the wind being\nbehind them, and they neared them rapidly.  \"I see ships afar,\" said\nthe king, \"coming swiftly towards the land.  Command the men of the\nCourt that they equip themselves, and go and learn their intent.\"  So\nthe men equipped themselves and went down towards them.  And when\nthey saw the ships near, certain were they that they had never seen\nships better furnished.  Beautiful flags of satin were upon them.\nAnd behold one of the ships outstripped the others, and they saw a\nshield lifted up above the side of the ship, and the point of the\nshield was upwards, in token of peace.  And the men drew near that\nthey might hold converse.  Then they put out boats and came towards\nthe land.  And they saluted the king.  Now the king could hear them\nfrom the place where he was, upon the rock above their heads.\n\"Heaven prosper you,\" said he, \"and be ye welcome.  To whom do these\nships belong, and who is the chief amongst you?\"  \"Lord,\" said they,\n\"Matholwch, king of Ireland, is here, and these ships belong to him.\"\n\"Wherefore comes he?' asked the king, \"and will he come to the land?\"\n\"He is a suitor unto thee, lord,\" said they, \"and he will not land\nunless he have his boon.\"  \"And what may that be?\" inquired the king.\n\"He desires to ally himself with thee, lord,\" said they, \"and he\ncomes to ask Branwen the daughter of Llyr, that, if it seem well to\nthee, the Island of the Mighty may be leagued with Ireland, and both\nbecome more powerful.\"  \"Verily,\" said he, \"let him come to land, and\nwe will take counsel thereupon.\"  And this answer was brought to\nMatholwch.  \"I will go willingly,\" said he.  So he landed, and they\nreceived him joyfully; and great was the throng in the palace that\nnight, between his hosts and those of the Court; and next day they\ntook counsel, and they resolved to bestow Branwen upon Matholwch.\nNow she was one of the three chief ladies of this island, and she was\nthe fairest damsel in the world.\n\nAnd they fixed upon Aberffraw as the place where she should become\nhis bride.  And they went thence, and towards Aberffraw the hosts\nproceeded; Matholwch and his host in their ships; Bendigeid Vran and\nhis host by land, until they came to Aberffraw.  And at Aberffraw\nthey began the feast and sat down.  And thus sat they.  The King of\nthe Island of the Mighty and Manawyddan the son of Llyr on one side,\nand Matholwch on the other side, and Branwen the daughter of Llyr\nbeside him.  And they were not within a house, but under tents.  No\nhouse could ever contain Bendigeid Vran.  And they began the banquet\nand caroused and discoursed.  And when it was more pleasing to them\nto sleep than to carouse, they went to rest, and that night Branwen\nbecame Matholwch's bride.\n\nAnd next day they arose, and all they of the Court, and the officers\nbegan to equip and to range the horses and the attendants, and they\nranged them in order as far as the sea.\n\nAnd behold one day, Evnissyen, the quarrelsome man of whom it is\nspoken above, came by chance into the place, where the horses of\nMatholwch were, and asked whose horses they might be.  \"They are the\nhorses of Matholwch king of Ireland, who is married to Branwen, thy\nsister; his horses are they.\"  \"And is it thus they have done with a\nmaiden such as she, and moreover my sister, bestowing her without my\nconsent?  They could have offered no greater insult to me than this,\"\nsaid he.  And thereupon he rushed under the horses and cut off their\nlips at the teeth, and their ears close to their heads, and their\ntails close to their backs, and wherever he could clutch their\neyelids, he cut them to the very bone, and he disfigured the horses\nand rendered them useless.\n\nAnd they came with these tidings unto Matholwch, saying that the\nhorses were disfigured, and injured so that not one of them could\never be of any use again.  \"Verily, lord,\" said one, \"it was an\ninsult unto thee, and as such was it meant.\"  \"Of a truth, it is a\nmarvel to me, that if they desire to insult me, they should have\ngiven me a maiden of such high rank and so much beloved of her\nkindred, as they have done.\"  \"Lord,\" said another, \"thou seest that\nthus it is, and there is nothing for thee to do but to go to thy\nships.\"  And thereupon towards his ships he set out.\n\nAnd tidings came to Bendigeid Vran that Matholwch was quitting the\nCourt without asking leave, and messengers were sent to inquire of\nhim wherefore he did so.  And the messengers that went were Iddic the\nson of Anarawd, and Heveydd Hir.  And these overtook him and asked of\nhim what he designed to do, and wherefore he went forth.  \"Of a\ntruth,\" said he, \"if I had known I had not come hither.  I have been\naltogether insulted, no one had ever worse treatment than I have had\nhere.  But one thing surprises me above all.\"  \"What is that?\" asked\nthey.  \"That Branwen the daughter of Llyr, one of the three chief\nladies of this island, and the daughter of the King of the Island of\nthe Mighty, should have been given me as my bride, and that after\nthat I should have been insulted; and I marvel that the insult was\nnot done me before they had bestowed upon me a maiden so exalted as\nshe.\"  \"Truly, lord, it was not the will of any that are of the\nCourt,\" said they, \"nor of any that are of the council, that thou\nshouldest have received this insult; and as thou hast been insulted,\nthe dishonour is greater unto Bendigeid Vran than unto thee.\"\n\"Verily,\" said he, \"I think so.  Nevertheless he cannot recall the\ninsult.\"  These men returned with that answer to the place where\nBendigeid Vran was, and they told him what reply Matholwch had given\nthem.  \"Truly,\" said he, \"there are no means by which we may prevent\nhis going away at enmity with us, that we will not take.\"  \"Well,\nlord,\" said they, \"send after him another embassy.\"  \"I will do so,\"\nsaid he.  \"Arise, Manawyddan son of Llyr, and Heveydd Hir, and Unic\nGlew Ysgwyd, and go after him, and tell him that he shall have a\nsound horse for every one that has been injured.  And beside that, as\nan atonement for the insult, he shall have a staff of silver, as\nlarge and as tall as himself, and a plate of gold of the breadth of\nhis face.  And show unto him who it was that did this, and that it\nwas done against my will; but that he who did it is my brother, by\nthe mother's side, and therefore it would be hard for me to put him\nto death.  And let him come and meet me,\" said he, \"and we will make\npeace in any way he may desire.\"\n\nThe embassy went after Matholwch, and told him all these sayings in a\nfriendly manner, and he listened thereunto.  \"Men,\" said he, \"I will\ntake counsel.\"  So to the council he went.  And in the council they\nconsidered that if they should refuse this, they were likely to have\nmore shame rather than to obtain so great an atonement.  They\nresolved therefore to accept it, and they returned to the Court in\npeace.\n\nThen the pavilions and the tents were set in order after the fashion\nof a hall; and they went to meat, and as they had sat at the\nbeginning of the feast, so sat they there.  And Matholwch and\nBendigeid Vran began to discourse; and behold it seemed to Bendigeid\nVran, while they talked, that Matholwch was not so cheerful as he had\nbeen before.  And he thought that the chieftain might be sad, because\nof the smallness of the atonement which he had, for the wrong that\nhad been done him.  \"Oh, man,\" said Bendigeid Vran, \"thou dost not\ndiscourse to-night so cheerfully as thou wast wont.  And if it be\nbecause of the smallness of the atonement, thou shalt add thereunto\nwhatsoever thou mayest choose, and to-morrow I will pay thee the\nhorses.\"  \"Lord,\" said he, \"Heaven reward thee.\"  \"And I will enhance\nthe atonement,\" said Bendigeid Vran, \"for I will give unto thee a\ncauldron, the property of which is, that if one of thy men be slain\nto-day, and be cast therein, to-morrow he will be as well as ever he\nwas at the best, except that he will not regain his speech.\"  And\nthereupon he gave him great thanks, and very joyful was he for that\ncause.\n\nAnd the next morning they paid Matholwch the horses as long as the\ntrained horses lasted.  And then they journeyed into another commot,\nwhere they paid him with colts until the whole had been paid, and\nfrom thenceforth that commot was called Talebolion.\n\nAnd a second night sat they together.  \"My lord,\" said Matholwch,\n\"whence hadst thou the cauldron which thou hast given me?\"  \"I had it\nof a man who had been in thy land,\" said he, \"and I would not give it\nexcept to one from there.\"  \"Who was it?\" asked he.  \"Llassar\nLlaesgyvnewid; he came here from Ireland with Kymideu Kymeinvoll, his\nwife, who escaped from the Iron House in Ireland, when it was made\nred hot around them, and fled hither.  And it is a marvel to me that\nthou shouldst know nothing concerning the matter.\"  \"Something I do\nknow,\" said he, \"and as much as I know I will tell thee.  One day I\nwas hunting in Ireland, and I came to the mound at the head of the\nlake, which is called the Lake of the Cauldron.  And I beheld a huge\nyellow-haired man coming from the lake with a cauldron upon his back.\nAnd he was a man of vast size, and of horrid aspect, and a woman\nfollowed after him.  And if the man was tall, twice as large as he\nwas the woman, and they came towards me and greeted me.  'Verily,'\nasked I, 'wherefore are you journeying?'  'Behold, this,' said he to\nme, 'is the cause that we journey.  At the end of a month and a\nfortnight this woman will have a son; and the child that will be born\nat the end of the month and the fortnight will be a warrior fully\narmed.'  So I took them with me and maintained them.  And they were\nwith me for a year.  And that year I had them with me not grudgingly.\nBut thenceforth was there murmuring, because that they were with me.\nFor, from the beginning of the fourth month they had begun to make\nthemselves hated and to be disorderly in the land; committing\noutrages, and molesting and harassing the nobles and ladies; and\nthenceforward my people rose up and besought me to part with them,\nand they bade me to choose between them and my dominions.  And I\napplied to the council of my country to know what should be done\nconcerning them; for of their own free will they would not go,\nneither could they be compelled against their will, through fighting.\nAnd [the people of the country] being in this strait, they caused a\nchamber to be made all of iron.  Now when the chamber was ready,\nthere came there every smith that was in Ireland, and every one who\nowned tongs and hammer.  And they caused coals to be piled up as high\nas the top of the chamber.  And they had the man, and the woman, and\nthe children, served with plenty of meat and drink; but when it was\nknown that they were drunk, they began to put fire to the coals about\nthe chamber, and they blew it with bellows until the house was red\nhot all around them.  Then was there a council held in the centre of\nthe floor of the chamber.  And the man tarried until the plates of\niron were all of a white heat; and then, by reason of the great heat,\nthe man dashed against the plates with his shoulder and struck them\nout, and his wife followed him; but except him and his wife none\nescaped thence.  And then I suppose, lord,\" said Matholwch unto\nBendigeid Vran, \"that he came over unto thee.\"  \"Doubtless he came\nhere,\" said he, \"and gave unto me the cauldron.\"  \"In what manner\ndidst thou receive them?\"  \"I dispersed them through every part of my\ndominions, and they have become numerous and are prospering\neverywhere, and they fortify the places where they are with men and\narms, of the best that were ever seen.\"\n\nThat night they continued to discourse as much as they would, and had\nminstrelsy and carousing, and when it was more pleasant to them to\nsleep than to sit longer, they went to rest.  And thus was the\nbanquet carried on with joyousness; and when it was finished,\nMatholwch journeyed towards Ireland, and Branwen with him, and they\nwent from Aber Menei with thirteen ships, and came to Ireland.  And\nin Ireland was there great joy because of their coming.  And not one\ngreat man or noble lady visited Branwen unto whom she gave not either\na clasp, or a ring, or a royal jewel to keep, such as it was\nhonourable to be seen departing with.  And in these things she spent\nthat year in much renown, and she passed her time pleasantly,\nenjoying honour and friendship.  And in the meanwhile it chanced that\nshe became pregnant, and in due time a son was born unto her, and the\nname that they gave him was Gwern the son of Matholwch, and they put\nthe boy out to be foster-nursed, in a place where were the best men\nof Ireland.\n\nAnd behold in the second year a tumult arose in Ireland, on account\nof the insult which Matholwch had received in Cambria, and the\npayment made him for his horses.  And his foster-brothers, and such\nas were nearest unto him, blamed him openly for that matter.  And he\nmight have no peace by reason of the tumult until they should revenge\nupon him this disgrace.  And the vengeance which they took was to\ndrive away Branwen from the same chamber with him, and to make her\ncook for the Court; and they caused the butcher after he had cut up\nthe meat to come to her and give her every day a blow on the ear, and\nsuch they made her punishment.\n\n\"Verily, lord,\" said his men to Matholwch, \"forbid now the ships and\nthe ferry boats and the coracles, that they go not into Cambria, and\nsuch as come over from Cambria hither, imprison them that they go not\nback for this thing to be known there.\"  And he did so; and it was\nthus for not less than three years.\n\nAnd Branwen reared a starling in the cover of the kneading trough,\nand she taught it to speak, and she taught the bird what manner of\nman her brother was.  And she wrote a letter of her woes, and the\ndespite with which she was treated, and she bound the letter to the\nroot of the bird's wing, and sent it towards Britain.  And the bird\ncame to this island, and one day it found Bendigeid Vran at Caer\nSeiont in Arvon, conferring there, and it alighted upon his shoulder\nand ruffled its feathers, so that the letter was seen, and they knew\nthat the bird had been reared in a domestic manner.\n\nThen Bendigeid Vran took the letter and looked upon it.  And when he\nhad read the letter he grieved exceedingly at the tidings of\nBranwen's woes.  And immediately he began sending messengers to\nsummon the island together.  And he caused sevenscore and four\ncountries to come unto him, and he complained to them himself of the\ngrief that his sister endured.  So they took counsel.  And in the\ncouncil they resolved to go to Ireland, and to leave seven men as\nprinces here, and Caradawc, the son of Bran, as the chief of them,\nand their seven knights.  In Edeyrnion were these men left.  And for\nthis reason were the seven knights placed in the town.  Now the names\nof these seven men were, Caradawc the son of Bran, and Heveydd Hir,\nand Unic Glew Ysgwyd, and Iddic the son of Anarawc Gwalltgrwn, and\nFodor the son of Ervyll, and Gwlch Minascwrn, and Llassar the son of\nLlaesar Llaesgygwyd, and Pendaran Dyved as a young page with them.\nAnd these abode as seven ministers to take charge of this island; and\nCaradawc the son of Bran was the chief amongst them.\n\nBendigeid Vran, with the host of which we spoke, sailed towards\nIreland, and it was not far across the sea, and he came to shoal\nwater.  It was caused by two rivers; the Lli and the Archan were they\ncalled; and the nations covered the sea.  Then he proceeded with what\nprovisions he had on his own back, and approached the shore of\nIreland.\n\nNow the swineherds of Matholwch were upon the seashore, and they came\nto Matholwch.  \"Lord,\" said they, \"greeting be unto thee.\"  \"Heaven\nprotect you,\" said he, \"have you any news?\"  \"Lord,\" said they, \"we\nhave marvellous news, a wood have we seen upon the sea, in a place\nwhere we never yet saw a single tree.\"  \"This is indeed a marvel,\"\nsaid he; \"saw you aught else?\"  \"We saw, lord,\" said they, \"a vast\nmountain beside the wood, which moved, and there was a lofty ridge on\nthe top of the mountain, and a lake on each side of the ridge.  And\nthe wood, and the mountain, and all these things moved.\"  \"Verily,\"\nsaid he, \"there is none who can know aught concerning this, unless it\nbe Branwen.\"\n\nMessengers then went unto Branwen.  \"Lady,\" said they, \"what thinkest\nthou that this is?\"  \"The men of the Island of the Mighty, who have\ncome hither on hearing of my ill-treatment and my woes.\"  \"What is\nthe forest that is seen upon the sea?\" asked they.  \"The yards and\nthe masts of ships,\" she answered.  \"Alas,\" said they, \"what is the\nmountain that is seen by the side of the ships?\"  \"Bendigeid Vran, my\nbrother,\" she replied, \"coming to shoal water; there is no ship that\ncan contain him in it.\"  \"What is the lofty ridge with the lake on\neach side thereof?\"  \"On looking towards this island he is wroth, and\nhis two eyes, one on each side of his nose, are the two lakes beside\nthe ridge.\"\n\nThe warriors and the chief men of Ireland were brought together in\nhaste, and they took counsel.  \"Lord,\" said the nobles unto\nMatholwch, \"there is no other counsel than to retreat over the Linon\n(a river which is in Ireland), and to keep the river between thee and\nhim, and to break down the bridge that is across the river, for there\nis a loadstone at the bottom of the river that neither ship nor\nvessel can pass over.\"  So they retreated across the river, and broke\ndown the bridge.\n\nBendigeid Vran came to land, and the fleet with him by the bank of\nthe river.  \"Lord,\" said his chieftains, \"knowest thou the nature of\nthis river, that nothing can go across it, and there is no bridge\nover it?\"  \"What,\" said they, \"is thy counsel concerning a bridge?\"\n\"There is none,\" said he, \"except that he who will be chief, let him\nbe a bridge.  I will be so,\" said he.  And then was that saying first\nuttered, and it is still used as a proverb.  And when he had lain\ndown across the river, hurdles were placed upon him, and the host\npassed over thereby.\n\nAnd as he rose up, behold the messengers of Matholwch came to him,\nand saluted him, and gave him greeting in the name of Matholwch, his\nkinsman, and showed how that of his goodwill he had merited of him\nnothing but good.  \"For Matholwch has given the kingdom of Ireland to\nGwern the son of Matholwch, thy nephew and thy sister's son.  And\nthis he places before thee, as a compensation for the wrong and\ndespite that has been done unto Branwen.  And Matholwch shall be\nmaintained wheresoever thou wilt, either here or in the Island of the\nMighty.\"  Said Bendigeid Vran, \"Shall not I myself have the kingdom?\nThen peradventure I may take counsel concerning your message.  From\nthis time until then no other answer will you get from me.\"\n\"Verily,\" said they, \"the best message that we receive for thee, we\nwill convey it unto thee, and do thou await our message unto him.\"\n\"I will wait,\" answered he, \"and do you return quickly.\"\n\nThe messengers set forth and came to Matholwch.  \"Lord,\" said they,\n\"prepare a better message for Bendigeid Vran.  He would not listen at\nall to the message that we bore him.\"  \"My friends,\" said Matholwch,\n\"what may be your counsel?\"  \"Lord,\" said they, \"there is no other\ncounsel than this alone.  He was never known to be within a house,\nmake therefore a house that will contain him and the men of the\nIsland of the Mighty on the one side, and thyself and thy host on the\nother; and give over thy kingdom to his will, and do him homage.  So\nby reason of the honour thou doest him in making him a house, whereas\nhe never before had a house to contain him, he will make peace with\nthee.\"  So the messengers went back to Bendigeid Vran, bearing him\nthis message.\n\nAnd he took counsel, and in the council it was resolved that he\nshould accept this, and this was all done by the advice of Branwen,\nand lest the country should be destroyed.  And this peace was made,\nand the house was built both vast and strong.  But the Irish planned\na crafty device, and the craft was that they should put brackets on\neach side of the hundred pillars that were in the house, and should\nplace a leathern bag on each bracket, and an armed man in every one\nof them.  Then Evnissyen came in before the host of the Island of the\nMighty, and scanned the house with fierce and savage looks, and\ndescried the leathern bags which were around the pillars.  \"What is\nin this bag?\" asked he of one of the Irish.  \"Meal, good soul,\" said\nhe.  And Evnissyen felt about it until he came to the man's head, and\nhe squeezed the head until he felt his fingers meet together in the\nbrain through the bone.  And he left that one and put his hand upon\nanother, and asked what was therein.  \"Meal,\" said the Irishman.  So\nhe did the like unto every one of them, until he had not left alive,\nof all the two hundred men, save one only; and when he came to him,\nhe asked what was there.  \"Meal, good soul,\" said the Irishman.  And\nhe felt about until he felt the head, and he squeezed that head as he\nhad done the others.  And, albeit he found that the head of this one\nwas armed, he left him not until he had killed him.  And then he sang\nan Englyn:-\n\n\n\"There is in this bag a different sort of meal,\nThe ready combatant, when the assault is made\nBy his fellow-warriors, prepared for battle.\"\n\n\nThereupon came the hosts unto the house.  The men of the Island of\nIreland entered the house on the one side, and the men of the Island\nof the Mighty on the other.  And as soon as they had sat down there\nwas concord between them; and the sovereignty was conferred upon the\nboy.  When the peace was concluded, Bendigeid Vran called the boy\nunto him, and from Bendigeid Vran the boy went unto Manawyddan, and\nhe was beloved by all that beheld him.  And from Manawyddan the boy\nwas called by Nissyen the son of Eurosswydd, and the boy went unto\nhim lovingly.  \"Wherefore,\" said Evnissyen, \"comes not my nephew the\nson of my sister unto me?  Though he were not king of Ireland, yet\nwillingly would I fondle the boy.\"  \"Cheerfully let him go to thee,\"\nsaid Bendigeid Vran, and the boy went unto him cheerfully.  \"By my\nconfession to Heaven,\" said Evnissyen in his heart, \"unthought of by\nthe household is the slaughter that I will this instant commit.\"\n\nThen he arose and took up the boy by the feet, and before any one in\nthe house could seize hold of him, he thrust the boy headlong into\nthe blazing fire.  And when Branwen saw her son burning in the fire,\nshe strove to leap into the fire also, from the place where she sat\nbetween her two brothers.  But Bendigeid Vran grasped her with one\nhand, and his shield with the other.  Then they all hurried about the\nhouse, and never was there made so great a tumult by any host in one\nhouse as was made by them, as each man armed himself.  Then said\nMorddwydtyllyon, \"The gadflies of Morddwydtyllyon's Cow!\"  And while\nthey all sought their arms, Bendigeid Vran supported Branwen between\nhis shield and his shoulder.\n\nThen the Irish kindled a fire under the cauldron of renovation, and\nthey cast the dead bodies into the cauldron until it was full, and\nthe next day they came forth fighting-men as good as before, except\nthat they were not able to speak.  Then when Evnissyen saw the dead\nbodies of the men of the Island of the Mighty nowhere resuscitated,\nhe said in his heart, \"Alas! woe is me, that I should have been the\ncause of bringing the men of the Island of the Mighty into so great a\nstrait.  Evil betide me if I find not a deliverance therefrom.\"  And\nhe cast himself among the dead bodies of the Irish, and two unshod\nIrishmen came to him, and, taking him to be one of the Irish, flung\nhim into the cauldron.  And he stretched himself out in the cauldron,\nso that he rent the cauldron into four pieces, and burst his own\nheart also.\n\nIn consequence of that the men of the Island of the Mighty obtained\nsuch success as they had; but they were not victorious, for only\nseven men of them all escaped, and Bendigeid Vran himself was wounded\nin the foot with a poisoned dart.  Now the seven men that escaped\nwere Pryderi, Manawyddan, Gluneu Eil Taran, Taliesin, Ynawc, Grudyen\nthe son of Muryel, and Heilyn the son of Gwynn Hen.\n\nAnd Bendigeid Vran commanded them that they should cut off his head.\n\"And take you my head,\" said he, \"and bear it even unto the White\nMount, in London, and bury it there, with the face towards France.\nAnd a long time will you be upon the road.  In Harlech you will be\nfeasting seven years, the birds of Rhiannon singing unto you the\nwhile.  And all that time the head will be to you as pleasant company\nas it ever was when on my body.  And at Gwales in Penvro you will be\nfourscore years, and you may remain there, and the head with you\nuncorrupted, until you open the door that looks towards Aber\nHenvelen, and towards Cornwall.  And after you have opened that door,\nthere you may no longer tarry, set forth then to London to bury the\nhead, and go straight forward.\"\n\nSo they cut off his head, and these seven went forward therewith.\nAnd Branwen was the eighth with them, and they came to land at Aber\nAlaw, in Talebolyon, and they sat down to rest.  And Branwen looked\ntowards Ireland and towards the Island of the Mighty, to see if she\ncould descry them.  \"Alas,\" said she, \"woe is me that I was ever\nborn; two islands have been destroyed because of me!\"  Then she\nuttered a loud groan, and there broke her heart.  And they made her a\nfour-sided grave, and buried her upon the banks of the Alaw.\n\nThen the seven men journeyed forward towards Harlech, bearing the\nhead with them; and as they went, behold there met them a multitude\nof men and of women.  \"Have you any tidings?\" asked Manawyddan.  \"We\nhave none,\" said they, \"save that Caswallawn the son of Beli has\nconquered the Island of the Mighty, and is crowned king in London.\"\n\"What has become,\" said they, \"of Caradawc the son of Bran, and the\nseven men who were left with him in this island?\"  \"Caswallawn came\nupon them, and slew six of the men, and Caradawc's heart broke for\ngrief thereof; for he could see the sword that slew the men, but knew\nnot who it was that wielded it.  Caswallawn had flung upon him the\nVeil of Illusion, so that no one could see him slay the men, but the\nsword only could they see.  And it liked him not to slay Caradawc,\nbecause he was his nephew, the son of his cousin.  And now he was the\nthird whose heart had broke through grief.  Pendaran Dyved, who had\nremained as a young page with these men, escaped into the wood,\" said\nthey.\n\nThen they went on to Harlech, and there stopped to rest, and they\nprovided meat and liquor, and sat down to eat and to drink.  And\nthere came three birds, and began singing unto them a certain song,\nand all the songs they had ever heard were unpleasant compared\nthereto; and the birds seemed to them to be at a great distance from\nthem over the sea, yet they appeared as distinct as if they were\nclose by, and at this repast they continued seven years.\n\nAnd at the close of the seventh year they went forth to Gwales in\nPenvro.  And there they found a fair and regal spot overlooking the\nocean; and a spacious hall was therein.  And they went into the hall,\nand two of its doors were open, but the third door was closed, that\nwhich looked towards Cornwall.  \"See, yonder,\" said Manawyddan, \"is\nthe door that we may not open.\"  And that night they regaled\nthemselves and were joyful.  And of all they had seen of food laid\nbefore them, and of all they had heard of, they remembered nothing;\nneither of that, nor of any sorrow whatsoever.  And there they\nremained fourscore years, unconscious of having ever spent a time\nmore joyous and mirthful.  And they were not more weary than when\nfirst they came, neither did they, any of them, know the time they\nhad been there.  And it was not more irksome to them having the head\nwith them, than if Bendigeid Vran had been with them himself.  And\nbecause of these fourscore years, it was called \"the Entertaining of\nthe noble Head.\"  The entertaining of Branwen and Matholwch was in\nthe time that they went to Ireland.\n\nOne day said Heilyn the son of Gwynn, \"Evil betide me, if I do not\nopen the door to know if that is true which is said concerning it.\"\nSo he opened the door and looked towards Cornwall and Aber Henvelen.\nAnd when they had looked, they were as conscious of all the evils\nthey had ever sustained, and of all the friends and companions they\nhad lost, and of all the misery that had befallen them, as if all had\nhappened in that very spot; and especially of the fate of their lord.\nAnd because of their perturbation they could not rest, but journeyed\nforth with the head towards London.  And they buried the head in the\nWhite Mount, and when it was buried, this was the third goodly\nconcealment; and it was the third ill-fated disclosure when it was\ndisinterred, inasmuch as no invasion from across the sea came to this\nisland while the head was in that concealment.\n\nAnd thus is the story related of those who journeyed over from\nIreland.\n\nIn Ireland none were left alive, except five pregnant women in a cave\nin the Irish wilderness; and to these five women in the same night\nwere born five sons, whom they nursed until they became grown-up\nyouths.  And they thought about wives, and they at the same time\ndesired to possess them, and each took a wife of the mothers of their\ncompanions, and they governed the country and peopled it.\n\nAnd these five divided it amongst them, and because of this partition\nare the five divisions of Ireland still so termed.  And they examined\nthe land where the battles had taken place, and they found gold and\nsilver until they became wealthy.\n\nAnd thus ends this portion of the Mabinogi, concerning the blow given\nto Branwen, which was the third unhappy blow of this island; and\nconcerning the entertainment of Bran, when the hosts of sevenscore\ncountries and ten went over to Ireland to revenge the blow given to\nBranwen; and concerning the seven years' banquet in Harlech, and the\nsinging of the birds of Rhiannon, and the sojourning of the head for\nthe space of fourscore years.\n\n\n\nMANAWYDDAN THE SON OF LLYR\nHERE IS THE THIRD PORTION OF THE MABINOGI\n\n\n\nWhen the seven men of whom we spoke above had buried the head of\nBendigeid Vran, in the White Mount an London, with its face towards\nFrance; Manawyddan gazed upon the town of London, and upon his\ncompanions, and heaved a great sigh; and much grief and heaviness\ncame upon him.  \"Alas, Almighty Heaven, woe is me,\" he exclaimed,\n\"there is none save myself without a resting-place this night.\"\n\"Lord,\" said Pryderi, \"be not so sorrowful.  Thy cousin is king of\nthe Island of the Mighty, and though he should do thee wrong, thou\nhast never been a claimant of land or possessions.  Thou art the\nthird disinherited prince.\"  \"Yea,\" answered he, \"but although this\nman is my cousin, it grieveth me to see any one in the place of my\nbrother Bendigeid Vran, neither can I be happy in the same dwelling\nwith him.\"  \"Wilt thou follow the counsel of another?\" said Pryderi.\n\"I stand in need of counsel,\" he answered, \"and what may that counsel\nbe?\"  \"Seven Cantrevs remain unto me,\" said Pryderi, \"wherein\nRhiannon my mother dwells.  I will bestow her upon thee and the seven\nCantrevs with her, and though thou hadst no possessions but those\nCantrevs only, thou couldst not have seven Cantrevs fairer than they.\nKicva, the daughter of Gwynn Gloyw, is my wife, and since the\ninheritance of the Cantrevs belongs to me, do thou and Rhiannon enjoy\nthem, and if thou ever desire any possessions thou wilt take these.\"\n\"I do not, Chieftain,\" said he; \"Heaven reward thee for thy\nfriendship.\"  \"I would show thee the best friendship in the world if\nthou wouldst let me.\"  \"I will, my friend,\" said he, \"and Heaven\nreward thee.  I will go with thee to seek Rhiannon and to look at thy\npossessions.\"  \"Thou wilt do well,\" he answered.  \"And I believe that\nthou didst never hear a lady discourse better than she, and when she\nwas in her prime none was ever fairer.  Even now her aspect is not\nuncomely.\"\n\nThey set forth, and, however long the journey, they came at length to\nDyved, and a feast was prepared for them against their coming to\nNarberth, which Rhiannon and Kicva had provided.  Then began\nManawyddan and Rhiannon to sit and to talk together, and from their\ndiscourse his mind and his thoughts became warmed towards her, and he\nthought in his heart he had never beheld any lady more fulfilled of\ngrace and beauty than she.  \"Pryderi,\" said he, \"I will that it be as\nthou didst say.\"  \"What saying was that?\" asked Rhiannon.  \"Lady,\"\nsaid Pryderi, \"I did offer thee as a wife to Manawyddan the son of\nLlyr.\"  \"By that will I gladly abide,\" said Rhiannon.  \"Right glad am\nI also,\" said Manawyddan; \"may Heaven reward him who hath shown unto\nme friendship so perfect as this.\"\n\nAnd before the feast was over she became his bride.  Said Pryderi,\n\"Tarry ye here the rest of the feast, and I will go into Lloegyr to\ntender my homage unto Caswallawn the son of Beli.\"  \"Lord,\" said\nRhiannon, \"Caswallawn is in Kent, thou mayest therefore tarry at the\nfeast, and wait until he shall be nearer.\"  \"We will wait,\" he\nanswered.  So they finished the feast.  And they began to make the\ncircuit of Dyved, and to hunt, and to take their pleasure.  And as\nthey went through the country, they had never seen lands more\npleasant to live in, nor better hunting grounds, nor greater plenty\nof honey and fish.  And such was the friendship between those four,\nthat they would not be parted from each other by night nor by day.\n\nAnd in the midst of all this he went to Caswallawn at Oxford, and\ntendered his homage; and honourable was his reception there, and\nhighly was he praised for offering his homage.\n\nAnd after his return, Pryderi and Manawyddan feasted and took their\nease and pleasure.  And they began a feast at Narberth, for it was\nthe chief palace; and there originated all honour.  And when they had\nended the first meal that night, while those who served them ate,\nthey arose and went forth, and proceeded all four to the Gorsedd of\nNarberth, and their retinue with them.  And as they sat thus, behold,\na peal of thunder, and with the violence of the thunderstorm, lo\nthere came a fall of mist, so thick that not one of them could see\nthe other.  And after the mist it became light all around.  And when\nthey looked towards the place where they were wont to see cattle, and\nherds, and dwellings, they saw nothing now, neither house, nor beast,\nnor smoke, nor fire, nor man, nor dwelling; but the houses of the\nCourt empty, and desert, and uninhabited, without either man or beast\nwithin them.  And truly all their companions were lost to them,\nwithout their knowing aught of what had befallen them, save those\nfour only.\n\n\"In the name of Heaven,\" cried Manawyddan, \"where are they of the\nCourt, and all my host beside these?  Let us go and see.\"  So they\ncame into the hall, and there was no man; and they went on to the\ncastle and to the sleeping-place, and they saw none; and in the mead-\ncellar and in the kitchen there was nought but desolation.  So they\nfour feasted, and hunted, and took their pleasure.  Then they began\nto go through the land and all the possessions that they had, and\nthey visited the houses and dwellings, and found nothing but wild\nbeasts.  And when they had consumed their feast and all their\nprovisions, they fed upon the prey they killed in hunting, and the\nhoney of the wild swarms.  And thus they passed the first year\npleasantly, and the second; but at the last they began to be weary.\n\n\"Verily,\" said Manawyddan, \"we must not bide thus.  Let us go into\nLloegyr, and seek some craft whereby we may gain our support.\"  So\nthey went into Lloegyr, and came as far as Hereford.  And they betook\nthemselves to making saddles.  And Manawyddan began to make housings,\nand he gilded and coloured them with blue enamel, in the manner that\nhe had seen it done by Llasar Llaesgywydd.  And he made the blue\nenamel as it was made by the other man.  And therefore is it still\ncalled Calch Lasar [blue enamel], because Llasar Llaesgywydd had\nwrought it.\n\nAnd as long as that workmanship could be had of Manawyddan, neither\nsaddle nor housing was bought of a saddler throughout all Hereford;\ntill at length every one of the saddlers perceived that they were\nlosing much of their gain, and that no man bought of them, but him\nwho could not get what he sought from Manawyddan.  Then they\nassembled together, and agreed to slay him and his companions.\n\nNow they received warning of this, and took counsel whether they\nshould leave the city.  \"By Heaven,\" said Pryderi, \"it is not my\ncounsel that we should quit the town, but that we should slay these\nboors.\"  \"Not so,\" said Manawyddan, \"for if we fight with them, we\nshall have evil fame, and shall be put in prison.  It were better for\nus to go to another town to maintain ourselves.\"  So they four went\nto another city.\n\n\"What craft shall we take?\" said Pryderi.  \"We will make shields,\"\nsaid Manawyddan.  \"Do we know anything about that craft?\" said\nPryderi.  \"We will try,\" answered he.  There they began to make\nshields, and fashioned them after the shape of the good shields they\nhad seen; and they enamelled they, as them had done the saddles.  And\nthey prospered in that place, so that not a shield was asked for in\nthe whole town, but such as was had of them.  Rapid therefore was\ntheir work, and numberless were the shields they made.  But at last\nthey were marked by the craftsmen, who came together in haste, and\ntheir fellow-townsmen with them, and agreed that they should seek to\nslay them.  But they received warning, and heard how the men had\nresolved on their destruction.  \"Pryderi,\" said Manawyddan, \"these\nmen desire to slay us.\"  \"Let us not endure this from these boors,\nbut let us rather fall upon them and slay them.\"  \"Not so,\" he\nanswered; \"Caswallawn and his men will hear of it, and we shall be\nundone.  Let us go to another town.\"  So to another town they went.\n\n\"What craft shall we take?\" said Manawyddan.  \"Whatsoever thou wilt\nthat we know,\" said Pryderi.  \"Not so,\" he replied, \"but let us take\nto making shoes, for there is not courage enough among cordwainers\neither to fight with us or to molest us.\"  \"I know nothing thereof,\"\nsaid Pryderi.  \"But I know,\" answered Manawyddan; \"and I will teach\nthee to stitch.  We will not attempt to dress the leather, but we\nwill buy it ready dressed and will make the shoes from it.\"\n\nSo he began by buying the best cordwal that could be had in the town,\nand none other would he buy except the leather for the soles; and he\nassociated himself with the best goldsmith in the town, and caused\nhim to make clasps for the shoes, and to gild the clasps, and he\nmarked how it was done until he learnt the method.  And therefore was\nhe called one of the three makers of Gold Shoes; and, when they could\nbe had from him, not a shoe nor hose was bought of any of the\ncordwainers in the town.  But when the cordwainers perceived that\ntheir gains were failing (for as Manawyddan shaped the work, so\nPryderi stitched it), they came together and took counsel, and agreed\nthat they would slay them.\n\n\"Pryderi,\" said Manawyddan, \"these men are minded to slay us.\"\n\"Wherefore should we bear this from the boorish thieves?\" said\nPryderi.  \"Rather let us slay them all.\"  \"Not so,\" said Manawyddan,\n\"we will not slay them, neither will we remain in Lloegyr any longer.\nLet us set forth to Dyved and go to see it.\"\n\nSo they journeyed along until they came to Dyved, and they went\nforward to Narberth.  And there they kindled fire and supported\nthemselves by hunting.  And thus they spent a month.  And they\ngathered their dogs around them, and tarried there one year.\n\nAnd one morning Pryderi and Manawyddan rose up to hunt, and they\nranged their dogs and went forth from the palace.  And some of the\ndogs ran before them and came to a small bush which was near at hand;\nbut as soon as they were come to the bush, they hastily drew back and\nreturned to the men, their hair bristling up greatly.  \"Let us go\nnear to the bush,\" said Pryderi, \"and see what is in it.\"  And as\nthey came near, behold, a wild boar of a pure white colour rose up\nfrom the bush.  Then the dogs, being set on by the men, rushed\ntowards him; but he left the bush and fell back a little way from the\nmen, and made a stand against the dogs without retreating from them,\nuntil the men had come near.  And when the men came up, he fell back\na second time, and betook him to flight.  Then they pursued the boar\nuntil they beheld a vast and lofty castle, all newly built, in a\nplace where they had never before seen either stone or building.  And\nthe boar ran swiftly into the castle and the dogs after him.  Now\nwhen the boar and the dogs had gone into the castle, they began to\nwonder at finding a castle in a place where they had never before\nseen any building whatsoever.  And from the top of the Gorsedd they\nlooked and listened for the dogs.  But so long as they were there\nthey heard not one of the dogs nor aught concerning them.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Pryderi, \"I will go into the castle to get tidings of\nthe dogs.\"  \"Truly,\" he replied, \"thou wouldst be unwise to go into\nthis castle, which thou hast never seen till now.  If thou wouldst\nfollow my counsel, thou wouldst not enter therein.  Whosoever has\ncast a spell over this land has caused this castle to be here.\"  \"Of\na truth,\" answered Pryderi, \"I cannot thus give up my dogs.\"  And for\nall the counsel that Manawyddan gave him, yet to the castle he went.\n\nWhen he came within the castle, neither man nor beast, nor boar nor\ndogs, nor house nor dwelling saw he within it.  But in the centre of\nthe castle floor he beheld a fountain with marble work around it, and\non the margin of the fountain a golden bowl upon a marble slab, and\nchains hanging from the air, to which he saw no end.\n\nAnd he was greatly pleased with the beauty of the gold, and with the\nrich workmanship of the bowl, and he went up to the bowl and laid\nhold of it.  And when he had taken hold of it his hands stuck to the\nbowl, and his feet to the slab on which the howl was placed, and all\nhis joyousness forsook him, so that he could not utter a word.  And\nthus he stood.\n\nAnd Manawyddan waited for him till near the close of the day.  And\nlate in the evening, being certain that he should have no tidings of\nPryderi or of the dogs, he went back to the palace.  And as he\nentered, Rhiannon looked at him.  \"Where,\" said she, \"are thy\ncompanion and thy dogs?\"  \"Behold,\" he answered, \"the adventure that\nhas befallen me.\"  And he related it all unto her.  \"An evil\ncompanion hast thou been,\" said Rhiannon, \"and a good companion hast\nthou lost.\"  And with that word she went out, and proceeded towards\nthe castle according to the direction which he gave her.  The gate of\nthe castle she found open.  She was nothing daunted, and she went in.\nAnd as she went in, she perceived Pryderi laying hold of the bowl,\nand she went towards him.  \"Oh, my lord,\" said she, \"what dust thou\ndo here?\"  And she took hold of the bowl with him; and as she did so\nher hands became fast to the bowl, and her feet to the slab, and she\nwas not able to utter a word.  And with that, as it became night, lo,\nthere came thunder upon them, and a fall of mist, and thereupon the\ncastle vanished, and they with it.\n\nWhen Kicva the daughter of Gwynn Gloyw saw that there was no one in\nthe palace but herself and Manawyddan, she sorrowed so that she cared\nnot whether she lived or died.  And Manawyddan saw this.  \"Thou art\nin the wrong,\" said he, \"if through fear of me thou grievest thus.  I\ncall Heaven to witness that thou hast never seen friendship mere pure\nthan that which I will bear thee, as long as Heaven will that thou\nshouldst be thus.  I declare to thee that were I in the dawn of youth\nI would keep my faith unto Pryderi, and unto thee also will I keep\nit.  Be there no fear upon thee, therefore,\" said he, \"for Heaven is\nmy witness that thou shalt meet with all the friendship thou canst\nwish, and that it is in my power to show thee, as long as it shall\nplease Heaven to continue us in this grief and woe.\"  \"Heaven reward\nthee,\" she said, \"and that is what I deemed of thee.\"  And the damsel\nthereupon took courage and was glad.\n\n\"Truly, lady,\" said Manawyddan, \"it is not fitting for us to stay\nhere, we have lost our dogs, and we cannot get food.  Let us go into\nLloegyr; it is easiest for us to find support there.\"  \"Gladly,\nlord,\" said she, \"we will do so.\"  And they set forth together to\nLloegyr.\n\n\"Lord,\" said she, \"what craft wilt thou follow?  Take up one that is\nseemly.\"  \"None other will I take,\" answered he, \"save that of making\nshoes, as I did formerly.\"  \"Lord,\" said she, \"such a craft becomes\nnot a man so nobly born as thou.\"  \"By that however will I abide,\"\nsaid he.\n\nSo he began his craft, and he made all his work of the finest leather\nhe could get in the town, and, as he had done at the other place, he\ncaused gilded clasps to be made for the shoes.  And except himself\nall the cordwainers in the town were idle, and without work.  For as\nlong as they could be had from him, neither shoes nor hose were\nbought elsewhere.  And thus they tarried there a year, until the\ncordwainers became envious, and took counsel concerning him.  And he\nhad warning thereof, and it was told him how the cordwainers had\nagreed together to slay him.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Kicva, \"wherefore should this be borne from these\nboors?\"  \"Nay,\" said he, \"we will go back unto Dyved.\"  So towards\nDyved they set forth.\n\nNow Manawyddan, when he set out to return to Dyved, took with him a\nburden of wheat.  And he proceeded towards Narberth, and there he\ndwelt.  And never was he better pleased than when he saw Narberth\nagain, and the lands where he had been wont to hunt with Pryderi and\nwith Rhiannon.  And he accustomed himself to fish, and to hunt the\ndeer in their covert.  And then he began to prepare some ground, and\nhe sowed a croft, and a second, and a third.  And no wheat in the\nworld ever sprung up better.  And the three crofts prospered with\nperfect growth, and no man ever saw fairer wheat than it.\n\nAnd thus passed the seasons of the year until the harvest came.  And\nhe went to look at one of his crofts, and behold it was ripe.  \"I\nwill reap this to-morrow,\" said he.  And that night he went back to\nNarberth, and on the morrow in the grey dawn he went to reap the\ncroft, and when he came there he found nothing but the bare straw.\nEvery one of the ears of the wheat was cut from off the stalk, and\nall the ears carried entirely away, and nothing but the straw left.\nAnd at this he marvelled greatly.\n\nThen he went to look at another croft, and behold that also was ripe.\n\"Verily,\" said he, \"this will I reap to-morrow.  And on the morrow he\ncame with the intent to reap it, and when he came there he found\nnothing but the bare straw.  \"Oh, gracious Heaven,\" he exclaimed, \"I\nknow that whosoever has begun my ruin is completing it, and has also\ndestroyed the country with me.\"\n\nThen he went to look at the third croft, and when he came there,\nfiner wheat had there never been seen, and this also was ripe.  \"Evil\nbetide me,\" said he, \"if I watch not here to-night.  Whoever carried\noff the other corn will come in like manner to take this.  And I will\nknow who it is.\"  So he took his arms, and began to watch the croft.\nAnd he told Kicva all that had befallen.  \"Verily,\" said she, \"what\nthinkest thou to do?\"  \"I will watch the croft to-night,\" said he.\n\nAnd he went to watch the croft.  And at midnight, lo, there arose the\nloudest tumult in the world.  And he looked, and behold the mightiest\nhost of mice in the world, which could neither be numbered nor\nmeasured.  And he knew not what it was until the mice had made their\nway into the croft, and each of them climbing up the straw and\nbending it down with its weight, had cut off one of the ears of\nwheat, and had carried it away, leaving there the stalk, and he saw\nnot a single stalk there that had not a mouse to it.  And they all\ntook their way, carrying the ears with them.\n\nIn wrath and anger did he rush upon the mice, but he could no more\ncome up with them than if they had been gnats, or birds in the air,\nexcept one only, which though it was but sluggish, went so fast that\na man on foot could scarce overtake it.  And after this one he went,\nand he caught it and put it in his glove, and tied up the opening of\nthe glove with a string, and kept it with him, and returned to the\npalace.  Then he came to the hall where Kicva was, and he lighted a\nfire, and hung the glove by the string upon a peg.  \"What hast thou\nthere, lord?\" said Kicva.  \"A thief,\" said he, \"that I found robbing\nme.\"  \"What kind of thief may it be, lord, that thou couldst put into\nthy glove?\" said she.  \"Behold I will tell thee,\" he answered.  Then\nhe showed her how his fields had been wasted and destroyed, and how\nthe mice came to the last of the fields in his sight.  \"And one of\nthem was less nimble than the rest, and is now in my glove; to-morrow\nI will hang it, and before Heaven, if I had them, I would hang them\nall.\"  \"My lord,\" said she, \"this is marvellous; but yet it would be\nunseemly for a man of dignity like thee to be hanging such a reptile\nas this.  And if thou doest right, thou wilt not meddle with the\ncreature, but wilt let it go.\"  \"Woe betide me,\" said he, \"if I would\nnot hang them all could I catch them, and such as I have I will\nhang.\"  \"Verily, lord,\" said she, \"there is no reason that I should\nsuccour this reptile, except to prevent discredit unto thee.  Do\ntherefore, lord, as thou wilt.\"  \"If I knew of any cause in the world\nwherefore thou shouldst succour it, I would take thy counsel\nconcerning it,\" said Manawyddan, \"but as I know of none, lady, I am\nminded to destroy it.\"  \"Do so willingly then,\" said she.\n\nAnd then he went to the Gorsedd of Narberth, taking the mouse with\nhim.  And he set up two forks on the highest part of the Gorsedd.\nAnd while he was doing this, behold he saw a scholar coming towards\nhim, in old and poor and tattered garments.  And it was now seven\nyears since he had seen in that place either man or beast, except\nthose four persons who had remained together until two of them were\nlost.\n\n\"My lord,\" said the scholar, \"good day to thee.\"  \"Heaven prosper\nthee, and my greeting be unto thee.  And whence dost thou come,\nscholar?\" asked he.  \"I come, lord, from singing in Lloegyr; and\nwherefore dost thou inquire?\"  \"Because for the last seven years,\"\nanswered he, \"I have seen no man here save four secluded persons, and\nthyself this moment.\"  \"Truly, lord,\" said he, \"I go through this\nland unto mine own.  And what work art thou upon, lord?\"  \"I am\nhanging a thief that I caught robbing me,\" said he.  \"What manner of\nthief is that?\" asked the scholar.  \"I see a creature in thy hand\nlike unto a mouse, and ill does it become a man of rank equal to\nthine to touch a reptile such as this.  Let it go forth free.\"  \"I\nwill not let it go free, by Heaven,\" said he; \"I caught it robbing\nme, and the doom of a thief will I inflict upon it, and I will hang\nit.\"  \"Lord,\" said he, \"rather than see a man of rank equal to thine\nat such a work as this, I would give thee a pound which I have\nreceived as alms, to let the reptile go forth free.\"  \"I will not let\nit go free,\" said he, \"by Heaven, neither will I sell it.\"  \"As thou\nwilt, lord,\" he answered; \"except that I would not see a man of rank\nequal to thine touching such a reptile, I care nought.\"  And the\nscholar went his way.\n\nAnd as he was placing the crossbeam upon the two forks, behold a\npriest came towards him upon a horse covered with trappings.  \"Good\nday to thee, lord,\" said he.  \"Heaven prosper thee,\" said Manawyddan;\n\"thy blessing.\"  \"The blessing of Heaven be upon thee.  And what,\nlord, art thou doing?\"  \"I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing\nme,\" said he.  \"What manner of thief, lord?\" asked he.  \"A creature,\"\nhe answered, \"in form of a mouse.  It has been robbing me, and I am\ninflicting upon it the doom of a thief.\"  \"Lord,\" said he, \"rather\nthan see thee touch this reptile, I would purchase its freedom.\"  \"By\nmy confession to Heaven, neither will I sell it nor set it free.\"\n\"It is true, lord, that it is worth nothing to buy; but rather than\nsee thee defile thyself by touching such a reptile as this, I will\ngive thee three pounds to let it go.\"  \"I will not, by Heaven,\" said\nhe, \"take any price for at.  As it ought, so shall it be hanged.\"\n\"Willingly, lord, do thy good pleasure.\"  And the priest went his\nway.\n\nThen he noosed the string around the mouse's neck, and as he was\nabout to draw it up, behold, he saw a bishop's retinue with his\nsumpter-horses, and his attendants.  And the bishop himself came\ntowards him.  And he stayed his work.  \"Lord bishop,\" said he, \"thy\nblessing.\"  \"Heaven's blessing be unto thee,\" said he; \"what work art\nthou upon?\"  \"Hanging a thief that I caught robbing me,\" said he.\n\"Is not that a mouse that I see in thy hand?\"  \"Yes,\" answered he.\n\"And she has robbed me.\"  \"Aye,\" said he, \"since I have come at the\ndoom of this reptile, I will ransom it of thee.  I will give thee\nseven pounds for it, and that rather than see a man of rank equal to\nthine destroying so vile a reptile as this.  Let it loose and thou\nshalt have the money.\"  \"I declare to Heaven that I will not set it\nloose.\"  \"If thou wilt not loose it for this, I will give thee four-\nand-twenty pounds of ready money to set it free.\"  \"I will not set it\nfree, by Heaven, for as much again,\" said he.  \"If thou wilt not set\nit free for this, I will give thee all the horses that thou seest in\nthis plain, and the seven loads of baggage, and the seven horses that\nthey are upon.\"  \"By Heaven, I will not,\" he replied.  \"Since for\nthis thou wilt not, do so at what price soever thou wilt.\"  \"I will\ndo so,\" said he.  \"I will that Rhiannon and Pryderi be free,\" said\nhe.  \"That thou shalt have,\" he answered.  \"Not yet will I loose the\nmouse, by Heaven.\"  \"What then wouldst thou?\"  \"That the charm and\nthe illusion be removed from the seven Cantrevs of Dyved.\"  \"This\nshalt thou have also; set therefore the mouse free.\"  \"I will not set\nit free, by Heaven,\" said he.  \"I will know who the mouse may be.\"\n\"She is my wife.\"  \"Even though she be, I will not set her free.\nWherefore came she to me?\"  \"To despoil thee,\" he answered.  \"I am\nLlwyd the son of Kilcoed, and I cast the charm over the seven\nCantrevs of Dyved.  And it was to avenge Gwawl the son of Clud, from\nthe friendship I had towards him, that I cast the charm.  And upon\nPryderi did I revenge Gwawl the son of Clud, for the game of Badger\nin the Bag, that Pwyll Pen Annwvyn played upon him, which he did\nunadvisedly in the Court of Heveydd Hen.  And when it was known that\nthou wast come to dwell in the land, my household came and besought\nme to transform them into mice, that they might destroy thy corn.\nAnd it was my own household that went the first night.  And the\nsecond night also they went, and they destroyed thy two crofts.  And\nthe third night came unto me my wife and the ladies of the Court, and\nbesought me to transform them.  And I transformed them.  Now she is\npregnant.  And had she not been pregnant thou wouldst not have been\nable to overtake her; but since this has taken place, and she has\nbeen caught, I will restore thee Pryderi and Rhiannon; and I will\ntake the charm and illusion from off Dyved.  I have now told thee who\nshe is.  Set her therefore free.\"  \"I will not set her free, by\nHeaven,\" said he.  \"What wilt thou more?\" he asked.  \"I will that\nthere be no more charm upon the seven Cantrevs of Dyved, and that\nnone shall be put upon it henceforth.\"  \"This thou shalt have,\" said\nhe.  \"Now set her free.\"  \"I will not, by my faith,\" he answered.\n\"What wilt thou furthermore?\" asked he.  \"Behold,\" said he, \"this\nwill I have; that vengeance be never taken for this, either upon\nPryderi or Rhiannon, or upon me.\"  \"All this shalt thou have.  And\ntruly thou hast done wisely in asking this.  Upon thy head would have\nlighted all this trouble.\"  \"Yea,\" said he, \"for fear thereof was it,\nthat I required this.\"  \"Set now my wife at liberty.\"  \"I will not,\nby Heaven,\" said he, \"until I see Pryderi and Rhiannon with me free.\"\n\"Behold, here they come,\" he answered.\n\nAnd thereupon behold Pryderi and Rhiannon.  And he rose up to meet\nthem, and greeted them, and sat down beside them.  \"Ah, Chieftain,\nset now my wife at liberty,\" said the bishop.  \"Hast thou not\nreceived all thou didst ask?\"  \"I will release her gladly,\" said he.\nAnd thereupon he set her free.\n\nThen Llwyd struck her with a magic wand, and she was changed back\ninto a young woman, the fairest ever seen.\n\n\"Look around upon thy land,\" said he, \"and then thou wilt see it all\ntilled and peopled, as it was in its best state.\"  And he rose up and\nlooked forth.  And when he looked he saw all the lands tilled, and\nfull of herds and dwellings.  \"What bondage,\" he inquired, \"has there\nbeen upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?\"  \"Pryderi has had the knockers of\nthe gate of my palace about his neck, and Rhiannon has had the\ncollars of the asses, after they have been carrying hay, about her\nneck.\"\n\nAnd such had been their bondage.\n\nAnd by reason of this bondage is this story called the Mabinogi of\nMynnweir and Mynord.\n\nAnd thus ends this portion of the Mabinogi.\n\n\n\nMATH THE SON OF MATHONWY\nTHIS IS THE FOURTH PORTION OF THE MABINOGI\n\n\n\nMath the son of Mathonwy was lord over Gwynedd, and Pryderi the son\nof Pwyll was lord over the one-and-twenty Cantrevs of the South; and\nthese were the seven Cantrevs of Dyved, and the seven Cantrevs of\nMorganwc, the four Cantrevs of Ceredigiawn, and the three of Ystrad\nTywi.\n\nAt that time, Math the son of Mathonwy could not exist unless his\nfeet were in the lap of a maiden, except only when he was prevented\nby the tumult of war.  Now the maiden who was with him was Goewin,\nthe daughter of Pebin of Dol Pebin, in Arvon, and she was the fairest\nmaiden of her time who was known there.\n\nAnd Math dwelt always at Caer Dathyl, in Arvon, and was not able to\ngo the circuit of the land, but Gilvaethwy the son of Don, and Eneyd\nthe son of Don, his nephews, the sons of his sisters, with his\nhousehold, went the circuit of the land in his stead.\n\nNow the maiden was with Math continually, and Gilvaethwy the son of\nDon set his affections upon her, and loved her so that he knew not\nwhat he should do because of her, and therefrom behold his hue, and\nhis aspect, and his spirits changed for love of her, so that it was\nnot easy to know him.\n\nOne day his brother Gwydion gazed steadfastly upon him.  \"Youth,\"\nsaid he, \"what aileth thee?\"  \"Why,\" replied he, \"what seest thou in\nme?\"  \"I see,\" said he, \"that thou hast lost thy aspect and thy hue;\nwhat, therefore, aileth thee?\"  \"My lord brother,\" he answered, \"that\nwhich aileth me, it will not profit me that I should own to any.\"\n\"What may it be, my soul?\" said he.  \"Thou knowest,\" he said, \"that\nMath the son of Mathonwy has this property, that if men whisper\ntogether, in a tone how low soever, if the wind meet it, it becomes\nknown unto him.\"  \"Yes,\" said Gwydion, \"hold now thy peace, I know\nthy intent, thou lovest Goewin.\"\n\nWhen he found that his brother knew his intent, he gave the heaviest\nsigh in the world.  \"Be silent, my soul, and sigh not,\" he said.  \"It\nis not thereby that thou wilt succeed.  I will cause,\" said he, \"if\nit cannot be otherwise, the rising of Gwynedd, and Powys, and\nDeheubarth, to seek the maiden.  Be thou of glad cheer therefore, and\nI will compass it.\"\n\nSo they went unto Math the son of Mathonwy.  \"Lord,\" said Gwydion, \"I\nhave heard that there have come to the South some beasts, such as\nwere never known in this island before.\"  \"What are they called?\" he\nasked.  \"Pigs, lord.\"  \"And what kind of animals are they?\"  \"They\nare small animals, and their flesh is better than the flesh of oxen.\"\n\"They are small, then?\"  \"And they change their names.  Swine are\nthey now called.\"  \"Who owneth them?\"  \"Pryderi the son of Pwyll;\nthey were sent him from Annwvyn, by Arawn the king of Annwvyn, and\nstill they keep that name, half hog, half pig.\"  \"Verily,\" asked he,\n\"and by what means may they be obtained from him?\"  \"I will go, lord,\nas one of twelve, in the guise of bards, to seek the swine.\"  \"But it\nmay be that he will refuse you,\" said he.  \"My journey will not be\nevil, lord,\" said he; \"I will not come back without the swine.\"\n\"Gladly,\" said he, \"go thou forward.\"\n\nSo he and Gilvaethwy went, and ten other men with them.  And they\ncame into Ceredigiawn, to the place that is now called Rhuddlan\nTeivi, where the palace of Pryderi was.  In the guise of bards they\ncame in, and they were received joyfully, and Gwydion was placed\nbeside Pryderi that night.\n\n\"Of a truth,\" said Pryderi, \"gladly would I have a tale from some of\nyour men yonder.\"  \"Lord,\" said Gwydion, \"we have a custom that the\nfirst night that we come to the Court of a great man, the chief of\nsong recites.  Gladly will I relate a tale.\"  Now Gwydion was the\nbest teller of tales in the world, and he diverted all the Court that\nnight with pleasant discourse and with tales, so that he charmed\nevery one in the Court, and it pleased Pryderi to talk with him.\n\nAnd after this, \"Lord,\" said he unto Pryderi, \"were it more pleasing\nto thee, that another should discharge my errand unto thee, than that\nI should tell thee myself what it is?\"  \"No,\" he answered, \"ample\nspeech hast thou.\"  \"Behold then, lord,\" said he, \"my errand.  It is\nto crave from thee the animals that were sent thee from Annwvyn.\"\n\"Verily,\" he replied, \"that were the easiest thing in the world to\ngrant, were there not a covenant between me and my land concerning\nthem.  And the covenant is that they shall not go from me, until they\nhave produced double their number in the land.\"  \"Lord,\" said he, \"I\ncan set thee free from those words, and this is the way I can do so;\ngive me not the swine to-night, neither refuse them unto me, and to-\nmorrow I will show thee an exchange for them.\"\n\nAnd that night he and his fellows went unto their lodging, and they\ntook counsel.  \"Ah, my men,\" said he, \"we shall not have the swine\nfor the asking.\"  \"Well,\" said they, \"how may they be obtained?\"  \"I\nwill cause them to be obtained,\" said Gwydion.\n\nThen he betook himself to his arts, and began to work a charm.  And\nhe caused twelve chargers to appear, and twelve black greyhounds,\neach of them white-breasted, and having upon them twelve collars and\ntwelve leashes, such as no one that saw them could know to be other\nthan gold.  And upon the horses twelve saddles, and every part which\nshould have been of iron was entirely of gold, and the bridles were\nof the same workmanship.  And with the horses and the dogs he came to\nPryderi.\n\n\"Good day unto thee, lord,\" said he.  \"Heaven prosper thee,\" said the\nother, \"and greetings be unto thee.\"  \"Lord,\" said he, \"behold here\nis a release for thee from the word which thou spakest last evening\nconcerning the swine; that thou wouldst neither give nor sell them.\nThou mayest exchange them for that which is better.  And I will give\nthese twelve horses, all caparisoned as they are, with their saddles\nand their bridles, and these twelve greyhounds, with their collars\nand their leashes as thou seest, and the twelve gilded shields that\nthou beholdest yonder.\"  Now these he had formed of fungus.  \"Well,\"\nsaid he, \"we will take counsel.\"  And they consulted together, and\ndetermined to give the swine to Gwydion, and to take his horses and\nhis dogs and his shields.\n\nThen Gwydion and his men took their leave, and began to journey forth\nwith the pigs.  \"Ah, my comrades,\" said Gwydion, \"it is needful that\nwe journey with speed.  The illusion will not last but from the one\nhour to the same to-morrow.\"\n\nAnd that night they journeyed as far as the upper part of\nCeredigiawn, to the place which, from that cause, is called Mochdrev\nstill.  And the next day they took their course through Melenydd, and\ncame that night to the town which is likewise for that reason called\nMochdrev between Keri and Arwystli.  And thence they journeyed\nforward; and that night they came as far as that Commot in Powys,\nwhich also upon account thereof is called Mochnant, and there tarried\nthey that night.  And they journeyed thence to the Cantrev of Rhos,\nand the place where they were that night is still called Mochdrev.\n\n\"My men,\" said Gwydion, \"we must push forward to the fastnesses of\nGwynedd with these animals, for there is a gathering of hosts in\npursuit of us.\"  So they journeyed on to the highest town of\nArllechwedd, and there they made a sty for the swine, and therefore\nwas the name of Creuwyryon given to that town.  And after they had\nmade the sty for the swine, they proceeded to Math the son of\nMathonwy, at Caer Dathyl.  And when they came there, the country was\nrising.  \"What news is there here?\" asked Gwydion.  \"Pryderi is\nassembling one-and-twenty Cantrevs to pursue after you,\" answered\nthey.  \"It is marvellous that you should have journeyed so slowly.\"\n\"Where are the animals whereof you went in quest?\" said Math.  \"They\nhave had a sty made for them in the other Cantrev below,\" said\nGwydion.\n\nThereupon, lo, they heard the trumpets and the host in the land, and\nthey arrayed themselves and set forward and came to Penardd in Arvon.\n\nAnd at night Gwydion the son of Don, and Gilvaethwy his brother,\nreturned to Caer Dathyl; and Gilvaethwy took Math the son of\nMathonwy's couch.  And while he turned out the other damsels from the\nroom discourteously, he made Goewin unwillingly remain.\n\nAnd when they saw the day on the morrow, they went back unto the\nplace where Math the son of Mathonwy was with his host; and when they\ncame there, the warriors were taking counsel in what district they\nshould await the coming of Pryderi, and the men of the South.  So\nthey went in to the council.  And it was resolved to wait in the\nstrongholds of Gwynedd, in Arvon.  So within the two Maenors they\ntook their stand, Maenor Penardd and Maenor Coed Alun.  And there\nPryderi attacked them, and there the combat took place.  And great\nwas the slaughter on both sides; but the men of the South were forced\nto flee.  And they fled unto the place which is still called\nNantcall.  And thither did they follow them, and they made a vast\nslaughter of them there, so that they fled again as far as the place\ncalled Dol Pen Maen, and there they halted and sought to make peace.\n\nAnd that he might have peace, Pryderi gave hostages, Gwrgi Gwastra\ngave he and three-and-twenty others, sons of nobles.  And after this\nthey journeyed in peace even unto Traeth Mawr; but as they went on\ntogether towards Melenryd, the men on foot could not be restrained\nfrom shooting.  Pryderi dispatched unto Math an embassy to pray him\nto forbid his people, and to leave it between him and Gwydion the son\nof Don, for that he had caused all this.  And the messengers came to\nMath.  \"Of a truth,\" said Math, \"I call Heaven to witness, if it be\npleasing unto Gwydion the son of Don, I will so leave it gladly.\nNever will I compel any to go to fight, but that we ourselves should\ndo our utmost.\"\n\n\"Verily,\" said the messengers, \"Pryderi saith that it were more fair\nthat the man who did him this wrong should oppose his own body to\nhis, and let his people remain unscathed.\"  \"I declare to Heaven, I\nwill not ask the men of Gwynedd to fight because of me.  If I am\nallowed to fight Pryderi myself, gladly will I oppose my body to\nhis.\"  And this answer they took back to Pryderi.  \"Truly,\" said\nPryderi, \"I shall require no one to demand my rights but myself.\"\n\nThen these two came forth and armed themselves, and they fought.  And\nby force of strength, and fierceness, and by the magic and charms of\nGwydion, Pryderi was slain.  And at Maen Tyriawc, above Melenryd, was\nhe buried, and there is his grave.\n\nAnd the men of the South set forth in sorrow towards their own land;\nnor is it a marvel that they should grieve, seeing that they had lost\ntheir lord, and many of their best warriors, and for the most part\ntheir horses and their arms.\n\nThe men of Gwynedd went back joyful and in triumph.  \"Lord,\" said\nGwydion unto Math, \"would it not be right for us to release the\nhostages of the men of the South, which they pledged unto us for\npeace? for we ought not to put them in prison.\"  \"Let them then be\nset free,\" saith Math.  So that youth, and the other hostages that\nwere with him, were set free to follow the men of the South.\n\nMath himself went forward to Caer Dathyl.  Gilvaethwy the son of Don,\nand they of the household that were with him, went to make the\ncircuit of Gwynedd as they were wont, without coming to the Court.\nMath went into his chamber, and caused a place to be prepared for him\nwhereon to recline, so that he might put his feet in the maiden's\nlap.  \"Lord,\" said Goewin, \"seek now another to hold thy feet, for I\nam now a wife.\"  \"What meaneth this?\" said he.  \"An attack, lord, was\nmade unawares upon me; but I held not my peace, and there was no one\nin the Court who knew not of it.  Now the attack was made by thy\nnephews, lord, the sons of thy sister, Gwydion the son of Don, and\nGilvaethwy the son of Don; unto me they did wrong, and unto thee\ndishonour.\"  \"Verily,\" he exclaimed, \"I will do to the utmost of my\npower concerning this matter.  But first I will cause thee to have\ncompensation, and then will I have amends made unto myself.  As for\nthee, I will take thee to be my wife, and the possession of my\ndominions will I give unto thy hands.\"\n\nAnd Gwydion and Gilvaethwy came not near the Court, but stayed in the\nconfines of the land until it was forbidden to give them meat and\ndrink.  At first they came not near unto Math, but at the last they\ncame.  \"Lord,\" said they, \"good day to thee.\"  \"Well,\" said he, \"is\nit to make me compensation that ye are come?\"  \"Lord,\" they said, \"we\nare at thy will.\"  \"By my will I would not have lost my warriors, and\nso many arms as I have done.  You cannot compensate me my shame,\nsetting aside the death of Pryderi.  But since ye come hither to be\nat my will, I shall begin your punishment forthwith.\"\n\nThen he took his magic wand, and struck Gilvaethwy, so that he became\na deer, and he seized upon the other hastily lest he should escape\nfrom him.  And he struck him with the same magic wand, and he became\na deer also.  \"Since now ye are in bonds, I will that ye go forth\ntogether and be companions, and possess the nature of the animals\nwhose form ye bear.  And this day twelvemonth come hither unto me.\"\n\nAt the end of a year from that day, lo there was a loud noise under\nthe chamber wall, and the barking of the dogs of the palace together\nwith the noise.  \"Look,\" said he, \"what is without.\"  \"Lord,\" said\none, \"I have looked; there are there two deer, and a fawn with them.\"\nThen he arose and went out.  And when he came he beheld the three\nanimals.  And he lifted up his wand.  \"As ye were deer last year, be\nye wild hogs each and either of you, for the year that is to come.\"\nAnd thereupon he struck them with the magic wand.  \"The young one\nwill I take and cause to be baptized.\"  Now the name that he gave him\nwas Hydwn.  \"Go ye and be wild swine, each and either of you, and be\nye of the nature of wild swine.  And this day twelvemonth be ye here\nunder the wall.\"\n\nAt the end of the year the barking of dogs was heard under the wall\nof the chamber.  And the Court assembled, and thereupon he arose and\nwent forth, and when he came forth he beheld three beasts.  Now these\nwere the beasts that he saw; two wild hogs of the woods, and a well-\ngrown young one with them.  And he was very large for his age.\n\"Truly,\" said Math, \"this one will I take and cause to be baptized.\"\nAnd he struck him with his magic wand, and he become a fine fair\nauburn-haired youth, and the name that he gave him was Hychdwn.  \"Now\nas for you, as ye were wild hogs last year, be ye wolves each and\neither of you for the year that is to come.\"  Thereupon he struck\nthem with his magic wand, and they became wolves.  \"And be ye of like\nnature with the animals whose semblance ye bear, and return here this\nday twelvemonth beneath this wall.\"\n\nAnd at the same day at the end of the year, he heard a clamour and a\nbarking of dogs under the wall of the chamber.  And he rose and went\nforth.  And when he came, behold, he saw two wolves, and a strong cub\nwith them.  \"This one will I take,\" said Math, \"and I will cause him\nto be baptized; there is a name prepared for him, and that is\nBleiddwn.  Now these three, such are they:-\n\n\nThe three sons of Gilvaethwy the false,\nThe three faithful combatants,\nBleiddwn, Hydwn, and Hychdwn the Tall.\"\n\n\nThen he struck the two with his magic wand, and they resumed their\nown nature.  \"Oh men,\" said he, \"for the wrong that ye did unto me\nsufficient has been your punishment and your dishonour.  Prepare now\nprecious ointment for these men, and wash their heads, and equip\nthem.\"  And this was done.\n\nAnd after they were equipped, they came unto him.  \"Oh men,\" said he,\n\"you have obtained peace, and you shall likewise have friendship.\nGive your counsel unto me, what maiden I shall seek.\"  \"Lord,\" said\nGwydion the son of Don, \"it is easy to give thee counsel; seek\nArianrod, the daughter of Don, thy niece, thy sister's daughter.\"\n\nAnd they brought her unto him, and the maiden came in.  \"Ha, damsel,\"\nsaid he, \"art thou the maiden?\"  \"I know not, lord, other than that I\nam.\"  Then he took up his magic wand, and bent it.  \"Step over this,\"\nsaid he, \"and I shall know if thou art the maiden.\"  Then stepped she\nover the magic wand, and there appeared forthwith a fine chubby\nyellow-haired boy.  And at the crying out of the boy, she went\ntowards the door.  And thereupon some small form was seen; but before\nany one could get a second glimpse of it, Gwydion had taken it, and\nhad flung a scarf of velvet around it and hidden it.  Now the place\nwhere he hid it was the bottom of a chest at the foot of his bed.\n\n\"Verily,\" said Math the son of Mathonwy, concerning the fine yellow-\nhaired boy, \"I will cause this one to be baptized, and Dylan is the\nname I will give him.\"\n\nSo they had the boy baptized, and as they baptized him he plunged\ninto the sea.  And immediately when he was in the sea, he took its\nnature, and swam as well as the best fish that was therein.  And for\nthat reason was he called Dylan, the son of the Wave.  Beneath him no\nwave ever broke.  And the blow whereby he came to his death, was\nstruck by his uncle Govannon.  The third fatal blow was it called.\n\nAs Gwydion lay one morning on his bed awake, he heard a cry in the\nchest at his feet; and though it was not loud, it was such that he\ncould hear it.  Then he arose in haste, and opened the chest:  and\nwhen he opened it, he beheld an infant boy stretching out his arms\nfrom the folds of the scarf, and casting it aside.  And he took up\nthe boy in his arms, and carried him to a place where he knew there\nwas a woman that could nurse him.  And he agreed with the woman that\nshe should take charge of the boy.  And that year he was nursed.\n\nAnd at the end of the year he seemed by his size as though he were\ntwo years old.  And the second year he was a big child, and able to\ngo to the Court by himself.  And when he came to the Court, Gwydion\nnoticed him, and the boy became familiar with him, and loved him\nbetter than any one else.  Then was the boy reared at the Court until\nhe was four years old, when he was as big as though he had been\neight.\n\nAnd one day Gwydion walked forth, and the boy followed him, and he\nwent to the Castle of Arianrod, having the boy with him; and when he\ncame into the Court, Arianrod arose to meet him, and greeted him and\nbade him welcome.  \"Heaven prosper thee,\" said he.  \"Who is the boy\nthat followeth thee?\" she asked.  \"This youth, he is thy son,\" he\nanswered.  \"Alas,\" said she, \"what has come unto thee that thou\nshouldst shame me thus? wherefore dost thou seek my dishonour, and\nretain it so long as this?\"  \"Unless thou suffer dishonour greater\nthan that of my bringing up such a boy as this, small will be thy\ndisgrace.\"  \"What is the name of the boy?\" said she.  \"Verily,\" he\nreplied, \"he has not yet a name.\"  \"Well,\" she said, \"I lay this\ndestiny upon him, that he shall never have a name until he receives\none from me.\"  \"Heaven bears me witness,\" answered he, \"that thou art\na wicked woman.  But the boy shall have a name how displeasing soever\nit may be unto thee.  As for thee, that which afflicts thee is that\nthou art no longer called a damsel.\"  And thereupon he went forth in\nwrath, and returned to Caer Dathyl and there he tarried that night.\n\nAnd the next day he arose and took the boy with him, and went to walk\non the seashore between that place and Aber Menei.  And there he saw\nsome sedges and seaweed, and he turned them into a boat.  And out of\ndry sticks and sedges he made some Cordovan leather, and a great deal\nthereof, and he coloured it in such a manner that no one ever saw\nleather more beautiful than it.  Then he made a sail to the boat, and\nhe and the boy went in it to the port of the castle of Arianrod.  And\nhe began forming shoes and stitching them, until he was observed from\nthe castle.  And when he knew that they of the castle were observing\nhim, he disguised his aspect, and put another semblance upon himself,\nand upon the boy, so that they might not be known.  \"What men are\nthose in yonder boat?\" said Arianrod.  \"They are cordwainers,\"\nanswered they.  \"Go and see what kind of leather they have, and what\nkind of work they can do.\"\n\nSo they came unto them.  And when they came he was colouring some\nCordovan leather, and gilding it.  And the messengers came and told\nher this.  \"Well,\" said she, \"take the measure of my foot, and desire\nthe cordwainer to make shoes for me.\"  So he made the shoes for her,\nyet not according to the measure, but larger.  The shoes then were\nbrought unto her, and behold they were too large.  \"These are too\nlarge,\" said she, \"but he shall receive their value.  Let him also\nmake some that are smaller than they.\"  Then he made her others that\nwere much smaller than her foot, and sent them unto her.  \"Tell him\nthat these will not go on my feet,\" said she.  And they told him\nthis.  \"Verily,\" said he, \"I will not make her any shoes, unless I\nsee her foot.\"  And this was told unto her.  \"Truly,\" she answered,\n\"I will go unto him.\"\n\nSo she went down to the boat, and when she came there, he was shaping\nshoes and the boy stitching them.  \"Ah, lady,\" said he, \"good day to\nthee.\"  \"Heaven prosper thee,\" said she.  \"I marvel that thou canst\nnot manage to make shoes according to a measure.\"  \"I could not,\" he\nreplied, \"but now I shall be able.\"\n\nThereupon behold a wren stood upon the deck of the boat, and the boy\nshot at it, and hit it in the leg between the sinew and the bone.\nThen she smiled.  \"Verily,\" said she, \"with a steady hand did the\nlion aim at it.\"  \"Heaven reward thee not, but now has he got a name.\nAnd a good enough name it is.  Llew Llaw Gyffes be he called\nhenceforth.\"\n\nThen the work disappeared in seaweed and sedges, and he went on with\nit no further.  And for that reason was he called the third Gold-\nshoemaker.  \"Of a truth,\" said she, \"thou wilt not thrive the better\nfor doing evil unto me.\"  \"I have done thee no evil yet,\" said he.\nThen he restored the boy to his own form.  \"Well,\" said she, \"I will\nlay a destiny upon this boy, that he shall never have arms and armour\nuntil I invest him with them.\"  \"By Heaven,\" said he, \"let thy malice\nbe what it may, he shall have arms.\"\n\nThen they went towards Dinas Dinllev, and there he brought up Llew\nLlaw Gyffes, until he could manage any horse, and he was perfect in\nfeatures, and strength, and stature.  And then Gwydion saw that he\nlanguished through the want of horses and arms.  And he called him\nunto him.  \"Ah, youth,\" said he, \"we will go to-morrow on an errand\ntogether.  Be therefore more cheerful than thou art.\"  \"That I will,\"\nsaid the youth.\n\nNext morning, at the dawn of day, they arose.  And they took way\nalong the sea coast, up towards Bryn Aryen.  And at the top of Cevn\nClydno they equipped themselves with horses, and went towards the\nCastle of Arianrod.  And they changed their form, and pricked towards\nthe gate in the semblance of two youths, but the aspect of Gwydion\nwas more staid than that of the other.  \"Porter,\" said he, \"go thou\nin and say that there are here bards from Glamorgan.\"  And the porter\nwent in.  \"The welcome of Heaven be unto them, let them in,\" said\nArianrod.\n\nWith great joy were they greeted.  And the hall was arranged, and\nthey went to meat.  When meat was ended, Arianrod discoursed with\nGwydion of tales and stories.  Now Gwydion was an excellent teller of\ntales.  And when it was time to leave off feasting, a chamber was\nprepared for them, and they went to rest.\n\nIn the early twilight Gwydion arose, and he called unto him his magic\nand his power.  And by the time that the day dawned, there resounded\nthrough the land uproar, and trumpets and shouts.  When it was now\nday, they heard a knocking at the door of the chamber, and therewith\nArianrod asking that it might be opened.  Up rose the youth and\nopened unto her, and she entered and a maiden with her.  \"Ah, good\nmen,\" she said, \"in evil plight are we.\"  \"Yes, truly,\" said Gwydion,\n\"we have heard trumpets and shouts; what thinkest thou that they may\nmean?\"  \"Verily,\" said she, \"we cannot see the colour of the ocean by\nreason of all the ships, side by side.  And they are making for the\nland with all the speed they can.  And what can we do?\" said she.\n\"Lady,\" said Gwydion, \"there is none other counsel than to close the\ncastle upon us, and to defend it as best we may.\"  \"Truly,\" said she,\n\"may Heaven reward you.  And do you defend it.  And here may you have\nplenty of arms.\"\n\nAnd thereupon went she forth for the arms, and behold she returned,\nand two maidens, and suits of armour for two men, with her.  \"Lady,\"\nsaid he, \"do you accoutre this stripling, and I will arm myself with\nthe help of thy maidens.  Lo, I hear the tumult of the men\napproaching.\"  \"I will do so, gladly.\"  So she armed him fully, and\nthat right cheerfully.  \"Hast thou finished arming the youth?\" said\nhe.  \"I have finished,\" she answered.  \"I likewise have finished,\"\nsaid Gwydion.  \"Let us now take off our arms, we have no need of\nthem.\"  \"Wherefore?\" said she.  \"Here is the army around the house.\"\n\"Oh, lady, there is here no army.\"  \"Oh,\" cried she, \"whence then was\nthis tumult?\"  \"The tumult was but to break thy prophecy and to\nobtain arms for thy son.  And now has he got arms without any thanks\nunto thee.\"  \"By Heaven,\" said Arianrod, \"thou art a wicked man.\nMany a youth might have lost his life through the uproar thou hast\ncaused in this Cantrev to-day.  Now will I lay a destiny upon this\nyouth,\" she said, \"that he shall never have a wife of the race that\nnow inhabits this earth.\"  \"Verily,\" said he, \"thou wast ever a\nmalicious woman, and no one ought to support thee.  A wife shall he\nhave notwithstanding.\"\n\nThey went thereupon unto Math the son of Mathonwy, and complained\nunto him most bitterly of Arianrod.  Gwydion showed him also how he\nhad procured arms for the youth.  \"Well,\" said Math, \"we will seek, I\nand thou, by charms and illusion, to form a wife for him out of\nflowers.  He has now come to man's stature, and he is the comeliest\nyouth that was ever beheld.\"  So they took the blossoms of the oak,\nand the blossoms of the broom, and the blossoms of the meadow-sweet,\nand produced from them a maiden, the fairest and most graceful that\nman ever saw.  And they baptized her, and gave her the name of\nBlodeuwedd.\n\nAfter she had become his bride, and they had feasted, said Gwydion,\n\"It is not easy for a man to maintain himself without possessions.\"\n\"Of a truth,\" said Math, \"I will give the young man the best Cantrev\nto hold.\"  \"Lord,\" said he, \"what Cantrev is that?\"  \"The Cantrev of\nDinodig,\" he answered.  Now it is called at this day Eivionydd and\nArdudwy.  And the place in the Cantrev where he dwelt, was a palace\nof his in a spot called Mur y Castell, on the confines of Ardudwy.\nThere dwelt he and reigned, and both he and his sway were beloved by\nall.\n\nOne day he went forth to Caer Dathyl, to visit Math the son of\nMathonwy.  And on the day that he set out for Caer Dathyl, Blodeuwedd\nwalked in the Court.  And she heard the sound of a horn.  And after\nthe sound of the horn, behold a tired stag went by, with dogs and\nhuntsmen following it.  And after the dogs and the huntsmen there\ncame a crowd of men on foot.  \"Send a youth,\" said she, \"to ask who\nyonder host may be.\"  So a youth went, and inquired who they were.\n\"Gronw Pebyr is this, the lord of Penllyn,\" said they.  And thus the\nyouth told her.\n\nGronw Pebyr pursued the stag, and by the river Cynvael he overtook\nthe stag and killed it.  And what with flaying the stag and baiting\nhis dogs, he was there until the night began to close in upon him.\nAnd as the day departed and the night drew near, he came to the gate\nof the Court.  \"Verily,\" said Blodeuwedd, \"the Chieftain will speak\nill of us if we let him at this hour depart to another land without\ninviting him in.\"  \"Yes, truly, lady,\" said they, \"it will be most\nfitting to invite him.\"\n\nThen went messengers to meet him and bid him in.  And he accepted her\nbidding gladly, and came to the Court, and Blodeuwedd went to meet\nhim, and greeted him, and bade him welcome.  \"Lady,\" said he, \"Heaven\nrepay thee thy kindness.\"\n\nWhen they had disaccoutred themselves, they went to sit down.  And\nBlodeuwedd looked upon him, and from the moment that she looked on\nhim she became filled with his love.  And he gazed on her, and the\nsame thought came unto him as unto her, so that he could not conceal\nfrom her that he loved her, but he declared unto her that he did so.\nThereupon she was very joyful.  And all their discourse that night\nwas concerning the affection and love which they felt one for the\nother, and which in no longer space than one evening had arisen.  And\nthat evening passed they in each other's company.\n\nThe next day he sought to depart.  But she said, \"I pray thee go not\nfrom me to-day.\"  And that night he tarried also.  And that night\nthey consulted by what means they might always be together.  \"There\nis none other counsel,\" said he, \"but that thou strive to learn from\nLlew Llaw Gyffes in what manner he will meet his death.  And this\nmust thou do under the semblance of solicitude concerning him.\"\n\nThe next day Gronw sought to depart.  \"Verily,\" said she, \"I will\ncounsel thee not to go from me to-day.\"  \"At thy instance will I not\ngo,\" said he, \"albeit, I must say, there is danger that the chief who\nowns the palace may return home.\"  \"To-morrow,\" answered she, \"will I\nindeed permit thee to go forth.\"\n\nThe next day he sought to go, and she hindered him not.  \"Be\nmindful,\" said Gronw, \"of what I have said unto thee, and converse\nwith him fully, and that under the guise of the dalliance of love,\nand find out by what means he may come to his death.\"\n\nThat night Llew Llaw Gyffes returned to his home.  And the day they\nspent in discourse, and minstrelsy, and feasting.  And at night they\nwent to rest, and he spoke to Blodeuwedd once, and he spoke to her a\nsecond time.  But, for all this, he could not get from her one word.\n\"What aileth thee?\" said he, \"art thou well?\"  \"I was thinking,\" said\nshe, \"of that which thou didst never think of concerning me; for I\nwas sorrowful as to thy death, lest thou shouldst go sooner than I.\"\n\"Heaven reward thy care for me,\" said he, \"but until Heaven take me I\nshall not easily be slain\"  \"For the sake of Heaven, and for mine,\nshow me how thou mightest be slain.  My memory in guarding is better\nthan thine.\"  \"I will tell thee gladly,\" said he.  \"Not easily can I\nbe slain, except by a wound.  And the spear wherewith I am struck\nmust be a year in the forming.  And nothing must be done towards it\nexcept during the sacrifice on Sundays.\"  \"Is this certain?\" asked\nshe.  \"It is in truth,\" he answered.  \"And I cannot be slain within a\nhouse, nor without.  I cannot be slain on horseback nor on foot.\"\n\"Verily,\" said she, \"in what manner then canst thou be slain?\"  \"I\nwill tell thee,\" said he.  \"By making a bath for me by the side of a\nriver, and by putting a roof over the cauldron, and thatching it well\nand tightly, and bringing a buck, and putting it beside the cauldron.\nThen if I place one foot on the buck's back, and the other on the\nedge of the cauldron, whosoever strikes me thus will cause my death.\"\n\"Well,\" said she, \"I thank Heaven that it will be easy to avoid\nthis.\"\n\nNo sooner had she held this discourse than she sent to Gronw Pebyr.\nGronw toiled at making the spear, and that day twelvemonth it was\nready.  And that very day he caused her to be informed thereof.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Blodeuwedd unto Llew, \"I have been thinking how it is\npossible that what thou didst tell me formerly can be true; wilt thou\nshow me in what manner thou couldst stand at once upon the edge of a\ncauldron and upon a buck, if I prepare the bath for thee?\"  \"I will\nshow thee,\" said he.\n\nThen she sent unto Gronw, and bade him be in ambush on the hill which\nis now called Bryn Kyvergyr, on the bank of the river Cynvael.  She\ncaused also to be collected all the goats that were in the Cantrev,\nand had them brought to the other side of the river, opposite Bryn\nKyvergyr.\n\nAnd the next day she spoke thus.  \"Lord,\" said she, \"I have caused\nthe roof and the bath to be prepared, and lo! they are ready.\"\n\"Well,\" said Llew, \"we will go gladly to look at them.\"\n\nThe day after they came and looked at the bath.  \"Wilt thou go into\nthe bath, lord?\" said she.  \"Willingly will I go in,\" he answered.\nSo into the bath he went, and he anointed himself.  \"Lord,\" said she,\n\"behold the animals which thou didst speak of as being called bucks.\"\n\"Well,\" said he, \"cause one of them to be caught and brought here.\"\nAnd the buck was brought.  Then Llew rose out of the bath, and put on\nhis trowsers, and he placed one foot on the edge of the bath and the\nother on the buck's back.\n\nThereupon Gronw rose up from the bill which is called Bryn Kyvergyr,\nand he rested on one knee, and flung the poisoned dart and struck him\non the side, so that the shaft started out, but the head of the dart\nremained in.  Then he flew up in the form of an eagle and gave a\nfearful scream.  And thenceforth was he no more seen.\n\nAs soon as he departed Gronw and Blodeuwedd went together unto the\npalace that night.  And the next day Gronw arose and took possession\nof Ardudwy.  And after he had overcome the land, he ruled over it, so\nthat Ardudwy and Penllyn were both under his sway.\n\nThen these tidings reached Math the son of Mathonwy.  And heaviness\nand grief came upon Math, and much more upon Gwydion than upon him.\n\"Lord,\" said Gwydion, \"I shall never rest until I have tidings of my\nnephew.\"  \"Verily,\" said Math, \"may Heaven be thy strength.\"  Then\nGwydion set forth and began to go forward.  And he went through\nGwynedd and Powys to the confines.  And when he had done so, he went\ninto Arvon, and came to the house of a vassal, in Maenawr Penardd.\nAnd he alighted at the house, and stayed there that night.  The man\nof the house and his house-hold came in, and last of all came there\nthe swineherd.  Said the man of the house to the swineherd, \"Well,\nyouth, hath thy sow come in to-night?\"  \"She hath,\" said he, \"and is\nthis instant returned to the pigs.\"  \"Where doth this sow go to?\"\nsaid Gwydion.  \"Every day, when the sty is opened, she goeth forth\nand none can catch sight of her, neither is it known whither she\ngoeth more than if she sank into the earth.\"  \"Wilt thou grant unto\nme,\" said Gwydion, \"not to open the sty until I am beside the sty\nwith thee?\"  \"This will I do, right gladly,\" he answered.\n\nThat night they went to rest; and as soon as the swineherd saw the\nlight of day, he awoke Gwydion.  And Gwydion arose and dressed\nhimself, and went with the swineherd, and stood beside the sty.  Then\nthe swineherd opened the sty.  And as soon as he opened it, behold\nshe leaped forth, and set off with great speed.  And Gwydion followed\nher, and she went against the course of a river, and made for a\nbrook, which is now called Nant y Llew.  And there she halted and\nbegan feeding.  And Gwydion came under the tree, and looked what it\nmight be that the sow was feeding on.  And he saw that she was eating\nputrid flesh and vermin.  Then looked he up to the top of the tree,\nand as he looked he beheld on the top of the tree an eagle, and when\nthe eagle shook itself, there fell vermin and putrid flesh from off\nit, and these the sow devoured.  And it seemed to him that the eagle\nwas Llew.  And he sang an Englyn:-\n\n\n\"Oak that grows between the two banks;\nDarkened is the sky and hill!\nShall I not tell him by his wounds,\nThat this is Llew?\"\n\n\nUpon this the eagle came down until he reached the centre of the\ntree.  And Gwydion sang another Englyn:-\n\n\n\"Oak that grows in upland ground,\nIs it not wetted by the rain?  Has it not been drenched\nBy nine score tempests?\nIt bears in its branches Llew Llaw Gyffes!\"\n\n\nThen the eagle came down until he was on the lowest branch of the\ntree, and thereupon this Englyn did Gwydion sing:-\n\n\n\"Oak that grows beneath the steep;\nStately and majestic is its aspect!\nShall I not speak it?\nThat Llew will come to my lap?\"\n\n\nAnd the eagle came down upon Gwydion's knee.  And Gwydion struck him\nwith his magic wand, so that he returned to his own form.  No one\never saw a more piteous sight, for he was nothing but skin and bone.\n\nThen he went unto Caer Dathyl, and there were brought unto him good\nphysicians that were in Gwynedd, and before the end of the year he\nwas quite healed.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he unto Math the son of Mathonwy, \"it is full time now\nthat I have retribution of him by whom I have suffered all this woe.\"\n\"Truly,\" said Math, \"he will never be able to maintain himself in the\npossession of that which is thy right.\"  \"Well,\" said Llew, \"the\nsooner I have my right, the better shall I be pleased.\"\n\nThen they called together the whole of Gwynedd, and set forth to\nArdudwy.  And Gwydion went on before and proceeded to Mur y Castell.\nAnd when Blodeuwedd heard that he was coming, she took her maidens\nwith her, and fled to the mountain.  And they passed through the\nriver Cynvael, and went towards a court that there was upon the\nmountain, and through fear they could not proceed except with their\nfaces looking backwards, so that unawares they fell into the lake.\nAnd they were all drowned except Blodeuwedd herself, and her Gwydion\novertook.  And he said unto her, \"I will not slay thee, but I will do\nunto thee worse than that.  For I will turn thee into a bird; and\nbecause of the shame thou hast done unto Llew Llaw Gyffes, thou shalt\nnever show thy face in the light of day henceforth; and that through\nfear of all the other birds.  For it shall be their nature to attack\nthee, and to chase thee from wheresoever they may find thee.  And\nthou shalt not lose thy name, but shalt be always called Blodeuwedd.\"\nNow Blodeuwedd is an owl in the language of this present time, and\nfor this reason is the owl hateful unto all birds.  And even now the\nowl is called Blodeuwedd.\n\nThen Gronw Pebyr withdrew unto Penllyn, and he dispatched thence an\nembassy.  And the messengers he sent asked Llew Llaw Gyffes if he\nwould take land, or domain, or gold, or silver, for the injury he had\nreceived.  \"I will not, by my confession to Heaven,\" said he.\n\"Behold this is the least that I will accept from him; that he come\nto the spot where I was when he wounded me with the dart, and that I\nstand where he did, and that with a dart I take my aim at him.  And\nthis is the very least that I will accept.\"\n\nAnd this was told unto Gronw Pebyr.  \"Verily,\" said he, \"is it\nneedful for me to do thus?  My faithful warriors, and my household,\nand my foster-brothers, is there not one among you who will stand the\nblow in my stead?\"  \"There is not, verily,\" answered they.  And\nbecause of their refusal to suffer one stroke for their lord, they\nare called the third disloyal tribe even unto this day.  \"Well,\" said\nhe, \"I will meet it.\"\n\nThen they two went forth to the banks of the river Cynvael, and Gronw\nstood in the place where Llew Llaw Gyffes was when he struck him, and\nLlew in the place where Gronw was.  Then said Gronw Pebyr unto Llew,\n\"Since it was through the wiles of a woman that I did unto thee as I\nhave done, I adjure thee by Heaven to let me place between me and the\nblow, the slab thou seest yonder on the river's bank.\"  \"Verily,\"\nsaid Llew, \"I will not refuse thee this.\"  \"Ah,\" said he, \"may Heaven\nreward thee.\"  So Gronw took the slab and placed it between him and\nthe blow.\n\nThen Llew flung the dart at him, and it pierced the slab and went\nthrough Gronw likewise, so that it pierced through his back.  And\nthus was Gronw Pebyr slain.  And there is still the slab on the bank\nof the river Cynvael, in Ardudwy, having the hole through it.  And\ntherefore is it even now called Llech Gronw.\n\nA second time did Llew Llaw Gyffes take possession of the land, and\nprosperously did he govern it.  And, as the story relates, he was\nlord after this over Gwynedd.  And thus ends this portion of the\nMabinogi.\n\n\n\nTHE DREAM OF MAXEN WLEDIG\n\n\n\nMaxen Wledig was emperor of Rome, and he was a comelier man, and a\nbetter and a wiser than any emperor that had been before him.  And\none day he held a council of kings, and he said to his friends, \"I\ndesire to go to-morrow to hunt.\"  And the next day in the morning he\nset forth with his retinue, and came to the valley of the river that\nflowed towards Rome.  And he hunted through the valley until mid-day.\nAnd with him also were two-and-thirty crowned kings, that were his\nvassals; not for the delight of hunting went the emperor with them,\nbut to put himself on equal terms with those kings.\n\nAnd the sun was high in the sky over their heads and the heat was\ngreat.  And sleep came upon Maxen Wledig.  And his attendants stood\nand set up their shields around him upon the shafts of their spears\nto protect him from the sun, and they placed a gold enamelled shield\nunder his head; and so Maxen slept.\n\nAnd he saw a dream.  And this is the dream that he saw.  He was\njourneying along the valley of the river towards its source; and he\ncame to the highest mountain in the world.  And he thought that the\nmountain was as high as the sky; and when he came over the mountain,\nit seemed to him that he went through the fairest and most level\nregions that man ever yet beheld, on the other side of the mountain.\nAnd he saw large and mighty rivers descending from the mountain to\nthe sea, and towards the mouths of the rivers he proceeded.  And as\nhe journeyed thus, he came to the mouth of the largest river ever\nseen.  And he beheld a great city at the entrance of the river, and a\nvast castle in the city, and he saw many high towers of various\ncolours in the castle.  And he saw a fleet at the mouth of the river,\nthe largest ever seen.  And he saw one ship among the fleet; larger\nwas it by far, and fairer than all the others.  Of such part of the\nship as he could see above the water, one plank was gilded and the\nother silvered over.  He saw a bridge of the bone of a whale from the\nship to the land, and he thought that he went along the bridge, and\ncame into the ship.  And a sail was hoisted on the ship, and along\nthe sea and the ocean was it borne.  Then it seemed that he came to\nthe fairest island in the whole world, and he traversed the island\nfrom sea to sea, even to the furthest shore of the island.  Valleys\nhe saw, and steeps, and rocks of wondrous height, and rugged\nprecipices.  Never yet saw he the like.  And thence he beheld an\nisland in the sea, facing this rugged land.  And between him and this\nisland was a country of which the plain was as large as the sea, the\nmountain as vast as the wood.  And from the mountain he saw a river\nthat flowed through the land and fell into the sea.  And at the mouth\nof the river he beheld a castle, the fairest that man ever saw, and\nthe gate of the castle was open, and he went into the castle.  And in\nthe castle he saw a fair hall, of which the roof seemed to be all\ngold, the walls of the hall seemed to be entirely of glittering\nprecious gems, the doors all seemed to be of gold.  Golden seats he\nsaw in the hall, and silver tables.  And on a seat opposite to him he\nbeheld two auburn-haired youths playing at chess.  He saw a silver\nboard for the chess, and golden pieces thereon.  The garments of the\nyouths were of jet-black satin, and chaplets of ruddy gold bound\ntheir hair, whereon were sparkling jewels of great price, rubies, and\ngems, alternately with imperial stones.  Buskins of new Cordovan\nleather on their feet, fastened by slides of red gold.\n\nAnd beside a pillar in the hall he saw a hoary-headed man, in a chair\nof ivory, with the figures of two eagles of ruddy gold thereon.\nBracelets of gold were upon his arms, and many rings were on his\nhands, and a golden torque about his neck; and his hair was bound\nwith a golden diadem.  He was of powerful aspect.  A chessboard of\ngold was before him, and a rod of gold, and a steel file in his hand.\nAnd he was carving out chessmen.\n\nAnd he saw a maiden sitting before him in a chair of ruddy gold.  Not\nmore easy than to gaze upon the sun when brightest, was it to look\nupon her by reason of her beauty.  A vest of white silk was upon the\nmaiden, with clasps of red gold at the breast; and a surcoat of gold\ntissue upon her, and a frontlet of red gold upon her head, and rubies\nand gems were in the frontlet, alternating with pearls and imperial\nstones.  And a girdle of ruddy gold was around her.  She was the\nfairest sight that man ever beheld.\n\nThe maiden arose from her chair before him, and he threw his arms\nabout the neck of the maiden, and they two sat down together in the\nchair of gold:  and the chair was not less roomy for them both, than\nfor the maiden alone.  And as he had his arms about the maiden's\nneck, and his cheek by her cheek, behold, through the chafing of the\ndogs at their leashing, and the clashing of the shields as they\nstruck against each other, and the beating together of the shafts of\nthe spears, and the neighing of the horses and their prancing, the\nemperor awoke.\n\nAnd when he awoke, nor spirit nor existence was left him, because of\nthe maiden whom he had seen in his sleep, for the love of the maiden\npervaded his whole frame.  Then his household spake unto him.\n\"Lord,\" said they, \"is it not past the time for thee to take thy\nfood?\"  Thereupon the emperor mounted his palfrey, the saddest man\nthat mortal ever saw, and went forth towards Rome.\n\nAnd thus he was during the space of a week.  When they of the\nhousehold went to drink wine and mead out of golden vessels, he went\nnot with any of them.  When they went to listen to songs and tales,\nhe went not with them there; neither could he be persuaded to do\nanything but sleep.  And as often as he slept, he beheld in his\ndreams the maiden he loved best; but except when he slept he saw\nnothing of her, for he knew not where in the world she was.\n\nOne day the page of the chamber spake unto him; now, although he was\npage of the chamber, he was king of the Romans.  \"Lord,\" said he,\n\"all the people revile thee.\"  \"Wherefore do they revile me?\" asked\nthe emperor.  \"Because they can get neither message nor answer from\nthee as men should have from their lord.  This is the cause why thou\nart spoken evil of.\"  \"Youth,\" said the emperor, \"do thou bring unto\nme the wise men of Rome, and I will tell them wherefore I am\nsorrowful.\"\n\nThen the wise men of Rome were brought to the emperor, and he spake\nto them.  \"Sages of Rome,\" said he, \"I have seen a dream.  And in the\ndream I beheld a maiden, and because of the maiden is there neither\nlife, nor spirit, nor existence within me.\"  \"Lord,\" they answered,\n\"since thou judgest us worthy to counsel thee, we will give thee\ncounsel.  And this is our counsel; that thou send messengers for\nthree years to the three parts of the world to seek for thy dream.\nAnd as thou knowest not what day or what night good news may come to\nthee, the hope thereof will support thee.\"\n\nSo the messengers journeyed for the space of a year, wandering about\nthe world, and seeking tidings concerning his dream.  But when they\ncame back at the end of the year, they knew not one word more than\nthey did the day they set forth.  And then was the emperor exceeding\nsorrowful, for he thought that he should never have tidings of her\nwhom best he loved.\n\nThen spoke the king of the Romans unto the emperor.  \"Lord,\" said he,\n\"go forth to hunt by the way thou didst seem to go, whether it were\nto the east, or to the west.\"  So the emperor went forth to the hunt,\nand he came to the bank of the river.  \"Behold,\" said he, \"this is\nwhere I was when I saw the dream, and I went towards the source of\nthe river westward.\"\n\nAnd thereupon thirteen messengers of the emperor's set forth, and\nbefore them they saw a high mountain, which seemed to them to touch\nthe sky.  Now this was the guise in which the messengers journeyed;\none sleeve was on the cap of each of them in front, as a sign that\nthey were messengers, in order that through what hostile land soever\nthey might pass no harm might be done them.  And when they were come\nover this mountain, they beheld vast plains, and large rivers flowing\nthere through.\n\n\"Behold,\" said they, \"the land which our master saw.\"\n\nAnd they went along the mouths of the rivers, until they came to the\nmighty river which they saw flowing to the sea, and the vast city,\nand the many-coloured high towers in the castle.  They saw the\nlargest fleet in the world, in the harbour of the river, and one ship\nthat was larger than any of the others.  \"Behold again,\" said they,\n\"the dream that our master saw.\"  And in the great ship they crossed\nthe sea, and came to the Island of Britain.  And they traversed the\nisland until they came to Snowdon.  \"Behold,\" said they, \"the rugged\nland that our master saw.\"  And they went forward until they saw\nAnglesey before them, and until they saw Arvon likewise.  \"Behold,\"\nsaid they, \"the land our master saw in his sleep.\"  And they saw Aber\nSain, and a castle at the mouth of the river.  The portal of the\ncastle saw they open, and into the castle they went, and they saw a\nhall in the castle.  Then said they, \"Behold, the hall which he saw\nin his sleep.\"  They went into the hall, and they beheld two youths\nplaying at chess on the golden bench.  And they beheld the hoary-\nheaded man beside the pillar, in the ivory chair, carving chessmen.\nAnd they beheld the maiden sitting on a chair of ruddy gold.\n\nThe messengers bent down upon their knees.  \"Empress of Rome, all\nhail!\"  \"Ha, gentles,\" said the maiden, \"ye bear the seeming of\nhonourable men, and the badge of envoys, what mockery is this ye do\nto me?\"  \"We mock thee not, lady; but the Emperor of Rome hath seen\nthee in his sleep, and he has neither life nor spirit left because of\nthee.  Thou shalt have of us therefore the choice, lady, whether thou\nwilt go with us and be made empress of Rome, or that the emperor come\nhither and take thee for his wife?\"  \"Ha, lords,\" said the maiden, \"I\nwill not deny what ye say, neither will I believe it too well.  If\nthe emperor love me, let him come here to seek me.\"\n\nAnd by day and night the messengers hied them back.  And when their\nhorses failed, they bought other fresh ones.  And when they came to\nRome, they saluted the emperor, and asked their boon, which was given\nto them according as they named it.  \"We will be thy guides, lord,\"\nsaid they, \"over sea and over land, to the place where is the woman\nwhom best thou lovest, for we know her name, and her kindred, and her\nrace.\"\n\nAnd immediately the emperor set forth with his army.  And these men\nwere his guides.  Towards the Island of Britain they went over the\nsea and the deep.  And he conquered the Island from Beli the son of\nManogan, and his sons, and drove them to the sea, and went forward\neven unto Arvon.  And the emperor knew the land when he saw it.  And\nwhen he beheld the castle of Aber Sain, \"Look yonder,\" said he,\n\"there is the castle wherein I saw the damsel whom I best love.\"  And\nhe went forward into the castle and into the hall, and there he saw\nKynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon the son of Eudav, playing at chess.\nAnd he saw Eudav the son of Caradawc, sitting on a chair of ivory\ncarving chessmen.  And the maiden whom he had beheld in his sleep, he\nsaw sitting on a chair of gold.  \"Empress of Rome,\" said he, \"all\nhail!\"  And the emperor threw his arms about her neck; and that night\nshe became his bride.\n\nAnd the next day in the morning, the damsel asked her maiden portion.\nAnd he told her to name what she would.  And she asked to have the\nIsland of Britain for her father, from the Channel to the Irish Sea,\ntogether with the three adjacent Islands, to hold under the empress\nof Rome; and to have three chief castles made for her, an whatever\nplaces she might choose in the Island of Britain.  And she chose to\nhave the highest castle made at Arvon.  And they brought thither\nearth from Rome that it might be more healthful for the emperor to\nsleep, and sit, and walk upon.  After that the two other castles were\nmade for her, which were Caerlleon and Caermarthen.\n\nAnd one day the emperor went to hunt at Caermarthen, and he came so\nfar as the top of Brevi Vawr, and there the emperor pitched his tent.\nAnd that encamping place is called Cadeir Maxen, even to this day.\nAnd because that he built the castle with a myriad of men, he called\nit Caervyrddin.  Then Helen bethought her to make high roads from one\ncastle to another throughout the Island of Britain.  And the roads\nwere made.  And for this cause are they called the roads of Helen\nLuyddawc, that she was sprung from a native of this island, and the\nmen of the Island of Britain would not have made these great roads\nfor any save for her.\n\nSeven years did the emperor tarry in this Island.  Now, at that time,\nthe men of Rome had a custom, that whatsoever emperor should remain\nin other lands more than seven years should remain to his own\noverthrow, and should never return to Rome again.\n\nSo they made a new emperor.  And this one wrote a letter of threat to\nMaxen.  There was nought in the letter but only this.  \"If thou\ncomest, and if thou ever comest to Rome.\"  And even unto Caerlleon\ncame this letter to Maxen, and these tidings.  Then sent he a letter\nto the man who styled himself emperor in Rome.  There was nought in\nthat letter also but only this.  \"If I come to Rome, and if I come.\"\n\nAnd thereupon Maxen set forth towards Rome with his army, and\nvanquished France and Bugundy, and every land on the way, and sat\ndown before the city of Rome.\n\nA year was the emperor before the city, and he was no nearer taking\nit than the first day.  And after him there came the brothers of\nHelen Luyddawc from the Island of Britain, and a small host with\nthem, and better warriors were in that small host than twice as many\nRomans.  And the emperor was told that a host was seen, halting close\nto his army and encamping, and no man ever saw a fairer or better\nappointed host for its size, nor more handsome standards.\n\nAnd Helen went to see the hosts, and she knew the standards of her\nbrothers.  Then came Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon the son of\nEudav, to meet the emperor.  And the emperor was glad because of\nthem, and embraced them.\n\nThen they looked at the Romans as they attacked the city.  Said Kynan\nto his brother, \"We will try to attack the city more expertly than\nthis.\"  So they measured by night the height of the wall, and they\nsent their carpenters to the wood, and a ladder was made for every\nfour men of their number.  Now when these were ready, every day at\nmid-day the emperors went to meat, and they ceased to fight on both\nsides till all had finished eating.  And in the morning the men of\nBritain took their food and they drank until they were invigorated.\nAnd while the two emperors were at meat, the Britons came to the\ncity, and placed their ladders against it, and forthwith they came in\nthrough the city.\n\nThe new emperor had no time to arm himself when they fell upon him,\nand slew him, and many others with him.  And three nights and three\ndays were they subduing the men that were in the city and taking the\ncastle.  And others of them kept the city, lest any of the host of\nMaxen should come therein, until they had subjected all to their\nwill.\n\nThen spake Maxen to Helen Luyddawc.  \"I marvel, lady,\" said he, \"that\nthy brothers have not conquered this city for me.\"  \"Lord, emperor,\"\nshe answered, \"the wisest youths in the world are my brothers.  Go\nthou thither and ask the city of them, and if it be in their\npossession thou shalt have it gladly.\"  So the emperor and Helen went\nand demanded the city.  And they told the emperor that none had taken\nthe city, and that none could give it him, but the men of the Island\nof Britain.  Then the gates of the city of Rome were opened, and the\nemperor sat on the throne, and all the men of Rome submitted them\nselves unto him.\n\nThe emperor then said unto Kynan and Adeon, \"Lords,\" said he, \"I have\nnow had possession of the whole of my empire.  This host give I unto\nyou to vanquish whatever region ye may desire in the world.\"\n\nSo they set forth and conquered lands, and castles, and cities.  And\nthey slew all the men, but the women they kept alive.  And thus they\ncontinued until the young men that had come with them were grown\ngrey-headed, from the length of time they were upon this conquest.\n\nThen spoke Kynan unto Adeon his brother, \"Whether wilt thou rather,\"\nsaid he, \"tarry in this land, or go back into the land whence thou\ndidst come forth?\"  Now he chose to go back to his own land, and many\nwith him.  But Kynan tarried there with the other part and dwelt\nthere.\n\nAnd they took counsel and cut out the tongues of the women, lest they\nshould corrupt their speech.  And because of the silence of the women\nfrom their own speech, the men of Armorica are called Britons.  From\nthat time there came frequently, and still comes, that language from\nthe Island of Britain.\n\nAnd this dream is called the Dream of Maxen Wledig, emperor of Rome.\nAnd here it ends.\n\n\n\nHERE IS THE STORY OF LLUDD AND LLEVELYS\n\n\n\nBeli the Great, the son of Manogan, had three sons, Lludd, and\nCaswallawn, and Nynyaw; and according to the story he had a fourth\nson called Llevelys.  And after the death of Beli, the kingdom of the\nIsland of Britain fell into the hands of Llud his eldest son; and\nLludd ruled prosperously, and rebuilt the walls of London, and\nencompassed it about with numberless towers.  And after that he bade\nthe citizens build houses therein, such as no houses in the kingdoms\ncould equal.  And moreover he was a mighty warrior, and generous and\nliberal in giving meat and drink to all that sought them.  And though\nhe had many castles and cities this one loved he more than any.  And\nhe dwelt therein most part of the year, and therefore was it called\nCaer Lludd, and at last Caer London.  And after the stranger-race\ncame there, it was called London, or Lwndrys.\n\nLludd loved Llevelys best of all his brothers, because he was a wise\nand discreet man.  Having heard that the king of France had died,\nleaving no heir except a daughter, and that he had left all his\npossessions in her hands, he came to Lludd his brother, to beseech\nhis counsel and aid.  And that not so much for his own welfare, as to\nseek to add to the glory and honour and dignity of his kindred, if he\nmight go to France to woo the maiden for his wife.  And forthwith his\nbrother conferred with him, and this counsel was pleasing unto him.\n\nSo he prepared ships and filled them with armed knights, and set\nforth towards France.  And as soon as they had landed, they sent\nmessengers to show the nobles of France the cause of the embassy.\nAnd by the joint counsel of the nobles of France and of the princes,\nthe maiden was given to Llevelys, and the crown of the kingdom with\nher.  And thenceforth he ruled the land discreetly, and wisely, and\nhappily, as long as his life lasted.\n\nAfter a space of time had passed, three plagues fell on the Island of\nBritain, such as none in the islands had ever seen the like of.  The\nfirst was a certain race that came, and was called the Coranians; and\nso great was their knowledge, that there was no discourse upon the\nface of the Island, however low it might be spoken, but what, if the\nwind met it, it was known to them.  And through this they could not\nbe injured. {4}\n\nThe second plague was a shriek which came on every May-eve, over\nevery hearth in the Island of Britain.  And this went through\npeople's hearts, and so scared them, that the men lost their hue and\ntheir strength, and the women their children, and the young men and\nthe maidens lost their senses, and all the animals and trees and the\nearth and the waters, were left barren.\n\nThe third plague was, that however much of provisions and food might\nbe prepared in the king's courts, were there even so much as a year's\nprovision of meat and drink, none of it could ever be found, except\nwhat was consumed in the first night.  And two of these plagues, no\none ever knew their cause, therefore was there better hope of being\nfreed from the first than from the second and third.\n\nAnd thereupon King Lludd felt great sorrow and care, because that he\nknew not how he might be freed from these plagues.  And he called to\nhim all the nobles of his kingdom, and asked counsel of them what\nthey should do against these afflictions.  And by the common counsel\nof the nobles, Lludd the son of Beli went to Llevelys his brother,\nking of France, for he was a man great of counsel and wisdom, to seek\nhis advice.\n\nAnd they made ready a fleet, and that in secret and in silence, lest\nthat race should know the cause of their errand, or any besides the\nking and his counsellors.  And when they were made ready, they went\ninto their ships, Lludd and those whom he chose with him.  And they\nbegan to cleave the seas towards France.\n\nAnd when these tidings came to Llevelys, seeing that he knew not the\ncause of his brother's ships, he came on the other side to meet him,\nand with him was a fleet vast of size.  And when Lludd saw this, he\nleft all the ships out upon the sea except one only; and in that one\nhe came to meet his brother, and he likewise with a single ship came\nto meet him.  And when they were come together, each put his arms\nabout the other's neck, and they welcomed each other with brotherly\nlove.\n\nAfter that Lludd had shown his brother the cause of his errand,\nLlevelys said that he himself knew the cause of the coming to those\nlands.  And they took counsel together to discourse on the matter\notherwise than thus, in order that the wind might not catch their\nwords, nor the Coranians know what they might say.  Then Llevelys\ncaused a long horn to be made of brass, and through this horn they\ndiscoursed.  But whatsoever words they spoke through this horn, one\nto the other, neither of them could hear any other but harsh and\nhostile words.  And when Llevelys saw this, and that there was a\ndemon thwarting them and disturbing through this horn, he caused wine\nto be put therein to wash it.  And through the virtue of the wine the\ndemon was driven out of the horn.  And when their discourse was\nunobstructed, Llevelys told his brother that he would give him some\ninsects whereof he should keep some to breed, lest by chance the like\naffliction might come a second time.  And other of these insects he\nshould take and bruise in water.  And he assured him that it would\nhave power to destroy the race of the Coranians.  That is to say,\nthat when he came home to his kingdom he should call together all the\npeople both of his own race and of the race of the Coranians for a\nconference, as though with the intent of making peace between them;\nand that when they were all together, he should take this charmed\nwater, and cast it over all alike.  And he assured him that the water\nwould poison the race of the Coranians, but that it would not slay or\nharm those of his own race.\n\n\"And the second plague,\" said he, \"that is in thy dominion, behold it\nis a dragon.  And another dragon of a foreign race is fighting with\nit, and striving to overcome it.  And therefore does your dragon make\na fearful outcry.  And on this wise mayest thou come to know this.\nAfter thou hast returned home, cause the Island to be measured in its\nlength and breadth, and in the place where thou dost find the exact\ncentral point, there cause a pit to be dug, and cause a cauldron full\nof the best mead that can be made to be put in the pit, with a\ncovering of satin over the face of the cauldron.  And then, in thine\nown person do thou remain there watching, and thou wilt see the\ndragon fighting in the form of terrific animals.  And at length they\nwill take the form of dragons in the air.  And last of all, after\nwearying themselves with fierce and furious fighting, they will fall\nin the form of two pigs upon the covering, and they will sink in, and\nthe covering with them, and they will draw it down to the very bottom\nof the cauldron.  And they will drink up the whole of the mead; and\nafter that they will sleep.  Thereupon do thou immediately fold the\ncovering around them, and bury them in a kistvaen, in the strongest\nplace thou hast in thy dominions, and hide them in the earth.  And as\nlong as they shall bide in that strong place no plague shall come to\nthe Island of Britain from elsewhere.\n\n\"The cause of the third plague,\" said he, \"is a mighty man of magic,\nwho take thy meat and thy drink and thy store.  And he through\nillusions and charms causes every one to sleep.  Therefore it is\nneedful for thee in thy own person to watch thy food and thy\nprovisions.  And lest he should overcome thee with sleep, be there a\ncauldron of cold water by thy side, and when thou art oppressed with\nsleep, plunge into the cauldron.\"\n\nThen Lludd returned back unto his land.  And immediately he summoned\nto him the whole of his own race and of the Coranians.  And as\nLlevelys had taught him, he bruised the insects in water, the which\nhe cast over them all together, and forthwith it destroyed the whole\ntribe of the Coranians, without hurt to any of the Britons.\n\nAnd some time after this, Lludd caused the Island to be measured in\nits length and in its breadth.  And in Oxford he found the central\npoint, and in that place he caused the earth to be dug, and in that\npit a cauldron to be set, full of the best mead that could be made,\nand a covering of satin over the face of it.  And he himself watched\nthat night.  And while he was there, he beheld the dragons fighting.\nAnd when they were weary they fell, and came down upon the top of the\nsatin, and drew it with them to the bottom of the cauldron.  And when\nthey had drunk the mead they slept.  And in their sleep, Lludd folded\nthe covering around them, and in the securest place he had in\nSnowdon, he hid them in a kistvaen.  Now after that this spot was\ncalled Dinas Emreis, but before that, Dinas Ffaraon.  And thus the\nfierce outcry ceased in his dominions.\n\nAnd when this was ended, King Lludd caused an exceeding great banquet\nto be prepared.  And when it was ready, he placed a vessel of cold\nwater by his side, and he in his own proper person watched it.  And\nas he abode thus clad with arms, about the third watch of the night,\nlo, he heard many surpassing fascinations and various songs.  And\ndrowsiness urged him to sleep.  Upon this, lest he should be hindered\nfrom his purpose and be overcome by sleep, he went often into the\nwater.  And at last, behold, a man of vast size, clad in strong,\nheavy armour, came in, bearing a hamper.  And, as he was wont, he put\nall the food and provisions of meat and drink into the hamper, and\nproceeded to go with it forth.  And nothing was ever more wonderful\nto Lludd, than that the hamper should hold so much.\n\nAnd thereupon King Lludd went after him and spoke unto him thus.\n\"Stop, stop,\" said he, \"though thou hast done many insults and much\nspoil erewhile, thou shalt not do so any more, unless thy skill in\narms and thy prowess be greater than mine.\"\n\nThen he instantly put down the hamper on the floor, and awaited him.\nAnd a fierce encounter was between them, so that the glittering fire\nflew out from their arms.  And at the last Lludd grappled with him,\nand fate bestowed the victory on Lludd.  And he threw the plague to\nthe earth.  And after he had overcome him by strength and might, he\nbesought his mercy.  \"How can I grant thee mercy,\" said the king,\n\"after all the many injuries and wrongs that thou hast done me?\"\n\"All the losses that ever I have caused thee,\" said he, \"I will make\nthee atonement for, equal to what I have taken.  And I will never do\nthe like from this time forth.  But thy faithful vassal will I be.\"\nAnd the king accepted this from him.\n\nAnd thus Lludd freed the Island of Britain from the three plagues.\nAnd from thenceforth until the end of his life, in prosperous peace\ndid Lludd the son of Beli rule the Island of Britain.  And this Tale\nis called the Story of Lludd and Llevelys.  And thus it ends.\n\n\n\nTALIESIN\n\n\n\nIn times past there lived in Penllyn a man of gentle lineage, named\nTegid Voel, and his dwelling was in the midst of the lake Tegid, and\nhis wife was called Caridwen.  And there was born to him of his wife\na son named Morvran ab Tegid, and also a daughter named Creirwy, the\nfairest maiden in the world was she; and they had a brother, the most\nill-favoured man in the world, Avagddu.  Now Caridwen his mother\nthought that he was not likely to be admitted among men of noble\nbirth, by reason of his ugliness, unless he had some exalted merits\nor knowledge.  For it was in the beginning of Arthur's time and of\nthe Round Table.\n\nSo she resolved, according to the arts of the books of the Fferyllt,\nto boil a cauldron of Inspiration and Science for her son, that his\nreception might be honourable because of his knowledge of the\nmysteries of the future state of the world.\n\nThen she began to boil the cauldron, which from the beginning of its\nboiling might not cease to boil for a year and a day, until three\nblessed drops were obtained of the grace of Inspiration.\n\nAnd she put Gwion Bach the son of Gwreang of Llanfair in Caereinion,\nin Powys, to stir the cauldron, and a blind man named Morda to kindle\nthe fire beneath it, and she charged them that they should not suffer\nit to cease boiling for the space of a year and a day.  And she\nherself, according to the books of the astronomers, and in planetary\nhours, gathered every day of all charm-bearing herbs.  And one day,\ntowards the end of the year, as Caridwen was culling plants and\nmaking incantations, it chanced that three drops of the charmed\nliquor flew out of the cauldron and fell upon the finger of Gwion\nBach.  And by reason of their great heat he put his finger to his\nmouth, and the instant he put those marvel-working drops into his\nmouth, he foresaw everything that was to come, and perceived that his\nchief care must be to guard against the wiles of Caridwen, for vast\nwas her skill.  And in very great fear he fled towards his own land.\nAnd the cauldron burst in two, because all the liquor within it\nexcept the three charm-bearing drops was poisonous, so that the\nhorses of Gwyddno Garanhir were poisoned by the water of the stream\ninto which the liquor of the cauldron ran, and the confluence of that\nstream was called the Poison of the Horses of Gwyddno from that time\nforth.\n\nThereupon came in Caridwen and saw all the toil of the whole year\nlost.  And she seized a billet of wood and struck the blind Morda on\nthe head until one of his eyes fell out upon his cheek.  And he said,\n\"Wrongfully hast thou disfigured me, for I am innocent.  Thy loss was\nnot because of me.\"  \"Thou speakest truth,\" said Caridwen, \"it was\nGwion Bach who robbed me.\"\n\nAnd she went forth after him, running.  And he saw her, and changed\nhimself into a hare and fled.  But she changed herself into a\ngreyhound and turned him.  And he ran towards a river, and became a\nfish.  And she in the form of an otter-bitch chased him under the\nwater, until he was fain to turn himself into a bird of the air.\nShe, as a hawk, followed him and gave him no rest in the sky.  And\njust as she was about to stoop upon him, and he was in fear of death,\nhe espied a heap of winnowed wheat on the floor of a barn, and he\ndropped among the wheat, and turned himself into one of the grains.\nThen she transformed herself into a high-crested black hen, and went\nto the wheat and scratched it with her feet, and found him out and\nswallowed him.  And, as the story says, she bore him nine months, and\nwhen she was delivered of him, she could not find it in her heart to\nkill him, by reason of his beauty.  So she wrapped him in a leathern\nbag, and cast him into the sea to the mercy of God, on the twenty-\nninth day of April.\n\nAnd at that time the weir of Gwyddno was on the strand between Dyvi\nand Aberystwyth, near to his own castle, and the value of an hundred\npounds was taken in that weir every May eve.  And in those days\nGwyddno had an only son named Elphin, the most hapless of youths, and\nthe most needy.  And it grieved his father sore, for he thought that\nhe was born in an evil hour.  And by the advice of his council, his\nfather had granted him the drawing of the weir that year, to see if\ngood luck would ever befall him, and to give him something wherewith\nto begin the world.\n\nAnd the next day when Elphin went to look, there was nothing in the\nweir.  But as he turned back he perceived the leathern bag upon a\npole of the weir.  Then said one of the weir-ward unto Elphin, \"Thou\nwast never unlucky until to-night, and now thou hast destroyed the\nvirtues of the weir, which always yielded the value of an hundred\npounds every May eve, and to-night there is nothing but this leathern\nskin within it.\"  \"How now,\" said Elphin, \"there may be therein the\nvalue of an hundred pounds.\"  Well, they took up the leathern bag,\nand he who opened it saw the forehead of the boy, and said to Elphin,\n\"Behold a radiant brow!\" {6}  \"Taliesin be he called,\" said Elphin.\nAnd he lifted the boy in his arms, and lamenting his mischance, he\nplaced him sorrowfully behind him.  And he made his horse amble\ngently, that before had been trotting, and he carried him as softly\nas if he had been sitting in the easiest chair in the world.  And\npresently the boy made a Consolation and praise to Elphin, and\nforetold honour to Elphin; and the Consolation was as you may see:-\n\n\n\"Fair Elphin, cease to lament!\nLet no one be dissatisfied with his own,\nTo despair will bring no advantage.\nNo man sees what supports him;\nThe prayer of Cynllo will not be in vain;\nGod will not violate his promise.\nNever in Gwyddno's weir\nWas there such good luck as this night.\nFair Elphin, dry thy cheeks!\nBeing too sad will not avail.\nAlthough thou thinkest thou hast no gain,\nToo much grief will bring thee no good;\nNor doubt the miracles of the Almighty:\nAlthough I am but little, I am highly gifted.\nFrom seas, and from mountains,\nAnd from the depths of rivers,\nGod brings wealth to the fortunate man.\nElphin of lively qualities,\nThy resolution is unmanly;\nThou must not be over sorrowful:\nBetter to trust in God than to forbode ill.\nWeak and small as I am,\nOn the foaming beach of the ocean,\nIn the day of trouble I shall be\nOf more service to thee than three hundred salmon.\nElphin of notable qualities,\nBe not displeased at thy misfortune;\nAlthough reclined thus weak in my bag,\nThere lies a virtue in my tongue.\nWhile I continue thy protector\nThou hast not much to fear;\nRemembering the names of the Trinity,\nNone shall be able to harm thee.\"\n\n\nAnd this was the first poem that Taliesin ever sang, being to console\nElphin in his grief for that the produce of the weir was lost, and,\nwhat was worse, that all the world would consider that it was through\nhis fault and ill-luck.  And then Gwyddno Garanhir {7} asked him what\nhe was, whether man or spirit.  Whereupon he sang this tale, and\nsaid:-\n\n\n\"First, I have been formed a comely person,\nIn the court of Caridwen I have done penance;\nThough little I was seen, placidly received,\nI was great on the floor of the place to where I was led;\nI have been a prized defence, the sweet muse the cause,\nAnd by law without speech I have been liberated\nBy a smiling black old hag, when irritated\nDreadful her claim when pursued:\nI have fled with vigour, I have fled as a frog,\nI have fled in the semblance of a crow, scarcely finding rest;\nI have fled vehemently, I have fled as a chain,\nI have fled as a roe into an entangled thicket;\nI have fled as a wolf cub, I have fled as a wolf in a wilderness,\nI have fled as a thrush of portending language;\nI have fled as a fox, used to concurrent bounds of quirks;\nI have fled as a martin, which did not avail;\nI have fled as a squirrel, that vainly hides,\nI have fled as a stag's antler, of ruddy course,\nI have fled as iron in a glowing fire,\nI have fled as a spear-head, of woe to such as has a wish for it;\nI have fled as a fierce hull bitterly fighting,\nI have fled as a bristly boar seen in a ravine,\nI have fled as a white grain of pure wheat,\nOn the skirt of a hempen sheet entangled,\nThat seemed of the size of a mare's foal,\nThat is filling like a ship on the waters;\nInto a dark leathern bag I was thrown,\nAnd on a boundless sea I was sent adrift;\nWhich was to me an omen of being tenderly nursed,\nAnd the Lord God then set me at liberty.\"\n\n\nThen came Elphin to the house or court of Gwyddno his father, and\nTaliesin with him.  And Gwyddno asked him if he had had a good haul\nat the weir, and he told him that he had got that which was better\nthan fish.  \"What was that?\" said Gwyddno.  \"A Bard,\" answered\nElphin.  Then said Gwyddno, \"Alas, what will he profit thee?\"  And\nTaliesin himself replied and said, \"He will profit him more than the\nweir ever profited thee.\"  Asked Gwyddno, \"Art thou able to speak,\nand thou so little?\"  And Taliesin answered him, \"I am better able to\nspeak than thou to question me.\"  \"Let me hear what thou canst say,\"\nquoth Gwyddno.  Then Taliesin sang:-\n\n\n\"In water there is a quality endowed with a blessing;\nOn God it is most just to meditate aright;\nTo God it is proper to supplicate with seriousness,\nSince no obstacle can there be to obtain a reward from him.\nThree times have I been born, I know by meditation;\nIt were miserable for a person not to come and obtain\nAll the sciences of the world, collected together in my breast,\nFor I know what has been, what in future will occur.\nI will supplicate my Lord that I get refuge in him,\nA regard I may obtain in his grace;\nThe Son of Mary is my trust, great in him is my delight,\nFor in him is the world continually upholden.\nGod has been to instruct me and to raise my expectation,\nThe true Creator of heaven, who affords me protection;\nIt is rightly intended that the saints should daily pray,\nFor God, the renovator, will bring them to him.\"\n\n\nAnd forthwith Elphin gave his haul to his wife, and she nursed him\ntenderly and lovingly.  Thenceforward Elphin increased in riches more\nand more day after day, and in love and favour with the king, and\nthere abode Taliesin until he was thirteen years old, when Elphin son\nof Gwyddno went by a Christmas invitation to his uncle, Maelgwn\nGwynedd, who some time after this held open court at Christmastide in\nthe castle of Dyganwy, for all the number of his lords of both\ndegrees, both spiritual and temporal, with a vast and thronged host\nof knights and squires.  And amongst them there arose a discourse and\ndiscussion.  And thus was it said.\n\n\"Is there in the whole world a king so great as Maelgwn, or one on\nwhom Heaven has bestowed so many spiritual gifts as upon him?  First,\nform, and beauty, and meekness, and strength, besides all the powers\nof the soul!\"  And together with these they said that Heaven had\ngiven one gift that exceeded all the others, which was the beauty,\nand comeliness, and grace, and wisdom, and modesty of his queen;\nwhose virtues surpassed those of all the ladies and noble maidens\nthroughout the whole kingdom.  And with this they put questions one\nto another amongst themselves:  Who had braver men?  Who had fairer\nor swifter horses or greyhounds?  Who had more skilful or wiser\nbards--than Maelgwn?\n\nNow at that time the bards were in great favour with the exalted of\nthe kingdom; and then none performed the office of those who are now\ncalled heralds, unless they were learned men, not only expert in the\nservice of kings and princes, but studious and well versed in the\nlineage, and arms, and exploits of princes and kings, and in\ndiscussions concerning foreign kingdoms, and the ancient things of\nthis kingdom, and chiefly in the annals of the first nobles; and also\nwere prepared always with their answers in various languages, Latin,\nFrench, Welsh, and English.  And together with this they were great\nchroniclers, and recorders, and skilful in framing verses, and ready\nin making englyns in every one of those languages.  Now of these\nthere were at that feast within the palace of Maelgwn as many as\nfour-and-twenty, and chief of them all was one named Heinin Vardd.\n\nWhen they had all made an end of thus praising the king and his\ngifts, it befell that Elphin spoke in this wise.  \"Of a truth none\nbut a king may vie with a king; but were he not a king, I would say\nthat my wife was as virtuous as any lady in the kingdom, and also\nthat I have a bard who is more skilful than all the king's bards.\"\nIn a short space some of his fellows showed the king all the\nboastings of Elphin; and the king ordered him to be thrown into a\nstrong prison, until he might know the truth as to the virtues of his\nwife, and the wisdom of his bard.\n\nNow when Elphin had been put in a tower of the castle, with a thick\nchain about his feet (it is said that it was a silver chain, because\nhe was of royal blood), the king, as the story relates, sent his son\nRhun to inquire into the demeanour of Elphin's wife.  Now Rhun was\nthe most graceless man in the world, and there was neither wife nor\nmaiden with whom he had held converse, but was evil spoken of.  While\nRhun went in haste towards Elphin's dwelling, being fully minded to\nbring disgrace upon his wife, Taliesin told his mistress how that the\nking had placed his master in durance in prison, and how that Rhun\nwas coming in haste to strive to bring disgrace upon her.  Wherefore\nhe caused his mistress to array one of the maids of her kitchen in\nher apparel; which the noble lady gladly did; and she loaded her\nhands with the best rings that she and her husband possessed.\n\nIn this guise Taliesin caused his mistress to put the maiden to sit\nat the board in her room at supper, and he made her to seem as her\nmistress, and the mistress to seem as the maid.  And when they were\nin due time seated at their supper in the manner that has been said,\nRhun suddenly arrived at Elphin's dwelling, and was received with\njoy, for all the servants knew him plainly; and they brought him in\nhaste to the room of their mistress, in the semblance of whom the\nmaid rose up from supper and welcomed him gladly.  And afterwards she\nsat down to supper again the second time, and Rhun with her.  Then\nRhun began jesting with the maid, who still kept the semblance of her\nmistress.  And verily this story shows that the maiden became so\nintoxicated, that she fell asleep; and the story relates that it was\na powder that Rhun put into the drink, that made her sleep so soundly\nthat she never felt it when he cut from off her hand her little\nfinger, whereupon was the signet ring of Elphin, which he had sent to\nhis wife as a token, a short time before.  And Rhun returned to the\nking with the finger and the ring as a proof, to show that he had cut\nit from off her hand, without her awaking from her sleep of\nintemperance.\n\nThe king rejoiced greatly at these tidings, and he sent for his\ncouncillors, to whom he told the whole story from the beginning.  And\nhe caused Elphin to be brought out of his prison, and he chided him\nbecause of his boast.  And he spake unto Elphin on this wise.\n\"Elphin, be it known to thee beyond a doubt that it is but folly for\na man to trust in the virtues of his wife further than he can see\nher; and that thou mayest be certain of thy wife's vileness, behold\nher finger, with thy signet ring upon it, which was cut from her hand\nlast night, while she slept the sleep of intoxication.\"  Then thus\nspake Elphin.  \"With thy leave, mighty king, I cannot deny my ring,\nfor it is known of many; but verily I assert strongly that the finger\naround which it is, was never attached to the hand of my wife, for in\ntruth and certainty there are three notable things pertaining to it,\nnone of which ever belonged to any of my wife's fingers.  The first\nof the three is, that it is certain, by your grace's leave, that\nwheresoever my wife is at this present hour, whether sitting, or\nstanding, or lying down, this ring would never remain upon her thumb,\nwhereas you can plainly see that it was hard to draw it over the\njoint of the little finger of the hand whence this was cut; the\nsecond thing is, that my wife has never let pass one Saturday since I\nhave known her without paring her nails before going to bed, and you\ncan see fully that the nail of this little finger has not been pared\nfor a month.  The third is, truly, that the hand whence this finger\ncame was kneading rye dough within three days before the finger was\ncut therefrom, and I can assure your goodness that my wife has never\nkneaded rye dough since my wife she has been.\"\n\nThen the king was mightily wroth with Elphin for so stoutly\nwithstanding him, respecting the goodness of his wife, wherefore he\nordered him to his prison a second time, saying that he should not be\nloosed thence until he had proved the truth of his boast, as well\nconcerning the wisdom of his bard as the virtues of his wife.\n\nIn the meantime his wife and Taliesin remained joyful at Elphin's\ndwelling.  And Taliesin showed his mistress how that Elphin was in\nprison because of them, but he bade her be glad, for that he would go\nto Maelgwn's court to free his master.  Then she asked him in what\nmanner he would set him free.  And he answered her:-\n\n\n\"A journey will I perform,\nAnd to the gate I will come;\nThe hall I will enter,\nAnd my song I will sing;\nMy speech I will pronounce\nTo silence royal bards,\nIn presence of their chief,\nI will greet to deride,\nUpon them I will break\nAnd Elphin I will free.\nShould contention arise,\nIn presence of the prince,\nWith summons to the bards,\nFor the sweet flowing song,\nAnd wizards' posing lore\nAnd wisdom of Druids,\nIn the court of the sons of the Distributor\nSome are who did appear\nIntent on wily schemes,\nBy craft and tricking means,\nIn pangs of affliction\nTo wrong the innocent,\nLet the fools be silent,\nAs erst in Badon's fight, -\nWith Arthur of liberal ones\nThe head, with long red blades;\nThrough feats of testy men,\nAnd a chief with his foes.\nWoe be to them, the fools,\nWhen revenge comes on them.\nI Taliesin, chief of bards,\nWith a sapient Druid's words,\nWill set kind Elphin free\nFrom haughty tyrant's bonds.\nTo their fell and chilling cry,\nBy the act of a surprising steed,\nFrom the far distant North,\nThere soon shall be an end.\nLet neither grace nor health\nBe to Maelgwn Gwynedd,\nFor this force and this wrong;\nAnd be extremes of ills\nAnd an avenged end\nTo Rhun and all his race:\nShort be his course of life,\nBe all his lands laid waste;\nAnd long exile be assigned\nTo Maelgwn Gwynedd!\"\n\n\nAfter this he took leave of his mistress, and came at last to the\nCourt of Maelgwn, who was going to sit in his hall and dine in his\nroyal state, as it was the custom in those days for kings and princes\nto do at every chief feast.  And as soon as Taliesin entered the\nhall, he placed himself in a quiet corner, near the place where the\nbards and the minstrels were wont to come in doing their service and\nduty to the king, as is the custom at the high festivals when the\nbounty is proclaimed.  And so, when the bards and the heralds came to\ncry largess, and to proclaim the power of the king and his strength,\nat the moment that they passed by the corner wherein he was\ncrouching, Taliesin pouted out his lips after them, and played\n\"Blerwm, blerwm,\" with his finger upon his lips.  Neither took they\nmuch notice of him as they went by, but proceeded forward till they\ncame before the king, unto whom they made their obeisance with their\nbodies, as they were wont, without speaking a single word, but\npouting out their lips, and making mouths at the king, playing\n\"Blerwm, blerwm,\" upon their lips with their fingers, as they had\nseen the boy do elsewhere.  This sight caused the king to wonder and\nto deem within himself that they were drunk with many liquors.\nWherefore he commanded one of his lords, who served at the board, to\ngo to them and desire them to collect their wits, and to consider\nwhere they stood, and what it was fitting for them to do.  And this\nlord did so gladly.  But they ceased not from their folly any more\nthan before.  Whereupon he sent to them a second time, and a third,\ndesiring them to go forth from the hall.  At the last the king\nordered one of his squires to give a blow to the chief of them named\nHeinin Vardd; and the squire took a broom and struck him on the head,\nso that he fell back in his seat.  Then he arose and went on his\nknees, and besought leave of the king's grace to show that this their\nfault was not through want of knowledge, neither through drunkenness,\nbut by the influence of some spirit that was in the hall.  And after\nthis Heinin spoke on this wise.  \"Oh, honourable king, be it known to\nyour grace, that not from the strength of drink, or of too much\nliquor, are we dumb, without power of speech like drunken men, but\nthrough the influence of a spirit that sits in the corner yonder in\nthe form of a child.\"  Forthwith the king commanded the squire to\nfetch him; and he went to the nook where Taliesin sat, and brought\nhim before the king, who asked him what he was, and whence he came.\nAnd he answered the king in verse.\n\n\n\"Primary chief bard am I to Elphin,\nAnd my original country is the region of the summer stars;\nIdno and Heinin called me Merddin,\nAt length every king will call me Taliesin.\n\nI was with my Lord in the highest sphere,\nOn the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell\nI have borne a banner before Alexander;\nI know the names of the stars from north to south;\nI have been on the galaxy at the throne of the Distributor;\nI was in Canaan when Absalom was slain;\nI conveyed the Divine Spirit to the level of the vale of Hebron;\nI was in the court of Don before the birth of Gwdion.\nI was instructor to Eli and Enoc;\nI have been winged by the genius of the splendid crosier;\nI have been loquacious prior to being gifted with speech;\nI was at the place of the crucifixion of the merciful Son of God;\nI have been three periods in the prison of Arianrod;\nI have been the chief director of the work of the tower of Nimrod;\nI am a wonder whose origin is not known.\nI have been in Asia with Noah in the ark,\nI have seen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra;\nI have been in India when Roma was built,\nI am now come here to the remnant of Troia.\n\nI have been with my Lord in the manger of the ass:\nI strengthened Moses through the water of Jordan;\nI have been in the firmament with Mary Magdalene;\nI have obtained the muse from the cauldron of Caridwen;\nI have been bard of the harp to Lleon of Lochlin.\nI have been on the White Hill, in the court of Cynvelyn,\nFor a day and a year in stocks and fetters,\nI have suffered hunger for the Son of the Virgin,\nI have been fostered in the land of the Deity,\nI have been teacher to all intelligences,\nI am able to instruct the whole universe.\nI shall be until the day of doom on the face of the earth;\nAnd it is not known whether my body is flesh or fish.\n\n   Then I was for nine months\n   In the womb of the hag Caridwen;\n   I was originally little Gwion,\n   And at length I am Taliesin.\"\n\n\nAnd when the king and his nobles had heard the song, they wondered\nmuch, for they had never heard the like from a boy so young as he.\nAnd when the king knew that he was the bard of Elphin, he bade\nHeinin, his first and wisest bard, to answer Taliesin and to strive\nwith him.  But when he came, he could do no other but play \"blerwm\"\non his lips; and when he sent for the others of the four-and-twenty\nbards they all did likewise, and could do no other.  And Maelgwn\nasked the boy Taliesin what was his errand, and he answered him in\nsong.\n\n\n\"Puny bards, I am trying\nTo secure the prize, if I can;\nBy a gentle prophetic strain\nI am endeavouring to retrieve\nThe loss I may have suffered;\nComplete the attempt I hope,\nSince Elphin endures trouble\nIn the fortress of Teganwy,\nOn him may there not be laid\nToo many chains and fetters;\nThe Chair of the fortress of Teganwy\nWill I again seek;\nStrengthened by my muse I am powerful;\nMighty on my part is what I seek,\nFor three hundred songs and more\nAre combined in the spell I sing.\nThere ought not to stand where I am\nNeither stone, neither ring;\nAnd there ought not to be about me\nAny bard who may not know\nThat Elphin the son of Gwyddno\nIs in the land of Artro,\nSecured by thirteen locks,\nFor praising his instructor;\nAnd then I Taliesin,\nChief of the bards of the west,\nShall loosen Elphin\nOut of a golden fetter.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"If you be primary bards\nTo the master of sciences,\nDeclare ye mysteries\nThat relate to the inhabitants of the world;\nThere is a noxious creature,\nFrom the rampart of Satanas,\nWhich has overcome all\nBetween the deep and the shallow;\nEqually wide are his jaws\nAs the mountains of the Alps;\nHim death will not subdue,\nNor hand or blades;\nThere is the load of nine hundred wagons\nIn the hair of his two paws;\nThere is in his head an eye\nGreen as the limpid sheet of icicle;\nThree springs arise\nIn the nape of his neck;\nSea-roughs thereon\nSwim through it;\nThere was the dissolution of the oxen\nOf Deivrdonwy the water-gifted.\nThe names of the three springs\nFrom the midst of the ocean;\nOne generated brine\nWhich is from the Corina,\nTo replenish the flood\nOver seas disappearing;\nThe second, without injury\nIt will fall on us,\nWhen there is rain abroad,\nThrough the whelming sky;\nThe third will appear\nThrough the mountain veins,\nLike a flinty banquet,\nThe work of the King of kings,\nYou are blundering bards,\nIn too much solicitude;\nYou cannot celebrate\nThe kingdom of the Britons;\nAnd I am Taliesin,\nChief of the bards of the west,\nWho will loosen Elphin\nOut of the golden fetter.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Be silent, then, ye unlucky rhyming bards,\nFor you cannot judge between truth and falsehood.\nIf you be primary bards formed by heaven,\nTell your king what his fate will be.\nIt is I who am a diviner and a leading bard,\nAnd know every passage in the country of your king;\nI shall liberate Elphin from the belly of the stony tower;\nAnd will tell your king what will befall him.\nA most strange creature will come from the sea marsh of Rhianedd\nAs a punishment of iniquity on Maelgwn Gwynedd;\nHis hair, his teeth, and his eyes being as gold,\nAnd this will bring destruction upon Maelgwn Gwynedd.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Discover thou what is\nThe strong creature from before the flood,\nWithout flesh, without bone,\nWithout vein, without blood,\nWithout head, without feet,\nIt will neither be older nor younger\nThan at the beginning;\nFor fear of a denial,\nThere are no rude wants\nWith creatures.\nGreat God! how the sea whitens\nWhen first it comes!\nGreat are its gusts\nWhen it comes from the south;\nGreat are its evaporations\nWhen it strikes on coasts.\nIt is in the field, it is in the wood,\nWithout hand, and without foot,\nWithout signs of old age,\nThough it be co-aeval\nWith the five ages or periods\nAnd older still,\nThough they be numberless years.\nIt is also so wide\nAs the surface of the earth;\nAnd it was not born,\nNor was it seen.\nIt will cause consternation\nWherever God willeth.\nOn sea, and on land,\nIt neither sees, nor is seen.\nIts course is devious,\nAnd will not come when desired;\nOn land and on sea,\nIt is indispensable.\nIt is without an equal,\nIt is four-sided;\nIt is not confined,\nIt is incomparable;\nIt comes from four quarters;\nIt will not be advised,\nIt will not be without advice.\nIt commences its journey\nAbove the marble rock,\nIt is sonorous, it is dumb,\nIt is mild,\nIt is strong, it is bold,\nWhen it glances over the land,\nIt is silent, it is vocal,\nIt is clamorous,\nIt is the most noisy\nOn the face of the earth.\nIt is good, it is bad,\nIt is extremely injurious.\nIt is concealed,\nBecause sight cannot perceive it.\nIt is noxious, it is beneficial;\nIt is yonder, it is here;\nIt will discompose,\nBut will not repair the injury;\nIt will not suffer for its doings,\nSeeing it is blameless.\nIt is wet, it is dry,\nIt frequently comes,\nProceeding from the heat of the sun,\nAnd the coldness of the moon.\nThe moon is less beneficial,\nInasmuch as her heat is less.\nOne Being has prepared it,\nOut of all creatures,\nBy a tremendous blast,\nTo wreak vengeance\nOn Maelgwn Gwynedd.\"\n\n\nAnd while he was thus singing his verse near the door, there arose a\nmighty storm of wind, so that the king and all his nobles thought\nthat the castle would fall on their heads.  And the king caused them\nto fetch Elphin in haste from his dungeon, and placed him before\nTaliesin.  And it is said, that immediately he sang a verse, so that\nthe chains opened from about his feet.\n\n\n\"I adore the Supreme, Lord of all animation, -\nHim that supports the heavens, Ruler of every extreme,\nHim that made the water good for all,\nHim who has bestowed each gift, and blesses it; -\nMay abundance of mead be given Maelgwn of Anglesey, who supplies us,\nFrom his foaming meadhorns, with the choicest pure liquor.\nSince bees collect, and do not enjoy,\nWe have sparkling distilled mead, which is universally praised.\nThe multitude of creatures which the earth nourishes\nGod made for man, with a view to enrich him; -\nSome are violent, some are mute, he enjoys them,\nSome are wild, some are tame; the Lord makes them; -\nPart of their produce becomes clothing;\nFor food and beverage till doom will they continue.\nI entreat the Supreme, Sovereign of the region of peace,\nTo liberate Elphin from banishment,\nThe man who gave me wine, and ale, and mead,\nWith large princely steeds, of beautiful appearance;\nMay he yet give me; and at the end,\nMay God of his good will grant me, in honour,\nA succession of numberless ages, in the retreat of tranquillity.\nElphin, knight of mead, late be thy dissolution!\"\n\n\nAnd afterwards he sang the ode which is called \"The Excellence of the\nBards.\"\n\n\n\"What was the first man\nMade by the God of heaven;\nWhat the fairest flattering speech\nThat was prepared by leuav;\nWhat meat, what drink,\nWhat roof his shelter;\nWhat the first impression\nOf his primary thinking;\nWhat became his clothing;\nWho carried on a disguise,\nOwing to the wilds of the country,\nIn the beginning?\nWherefore should a stone be hard;\nWhy should a thorn be sharp-pointed?\nWho is hard like a flint;\nWho is salt like brine;\nWho sweet like honey;\nWho rides on the gale;\nWhy ridged should be the nose;\nWhy should a wheel be round;\nWhy should the tongue be gifted with speech\nRather than another member?\nIf thy bards, Heinin, be competent,\nLet them reply to me, Taliesin.\"\n\n\nAnd after that he sang the address which is called \"The Reproof of\nthe Bards.\"\n\n\n\"If thou art a bard completely imbued\nWith genius not to be controlled,\nBe thou not untractable\nWithin the court of thy king;\nUntil thy rigmarole shall be known,\nBe thou silent, Heinin,\nAs to the name of thy verse,\nAnd the name of thy vaunting;\nAnd as to the name of thy grandsire\nPrior to his being baptized.\nAnd the name of the sphere,\nAnd the name of the element,\nAnd the name of thy language,\nAnd the name of thy region.\nAvaunt, ye bards above,\nAvaunt, ye bards below!\nMy beloved is below,\nIn the fetter of Ariansod\nIt is certain you know not\nHow to understand the song I utter,\nNor clearly how to discriminate\nBetween the truth and what is false;\nPuny bards, crows of the district,\nWhy do you not take to flight?\nA bard that will not silence me,\nSilence may he not obtain,\nTill he goes to be covered\nUnder gravel and pebbles;\nSuch as shall listen to me,\nMay God listen to him.\"\n\n\nThen sang he the piece called \"The Spite of the Bards.\"\n\n\n\"Minstrels persevere in their false custom,\nImmoral ditties are their delight;\nVain and tasteless praise they recite;\nFalsehood at all times do they utter;\nThe innocent persons they ridicule;\nMarried women they destroy,\nInnocent virgins of Mary they corrupt;\nAs they pass their lives away in vanity,\nPoor innocent persons they ridicule;\nAt night they get drunk, they sleep the day;\nIn idleness without work they feed themselves;\nThe Church they hate, and the tavern they frequent;\nWith thieves and perjured fellows they associate;\nAt courts they inquire after feasts;\nEvery senseless word they bring forward;\nEvery deadly sin they praise;\nEvery vile course of life they lead;\nThrough every village, town, and country they stroll;\nConcerning the gripe of death they think not;\nNeither lodging nor charity do they give;\nIndulging in victuals to excess.\nPsalms or prayers they do not use,\nTithes or offerings to God they do not pay,\nOn holidays or Sundays they do not worship;\nVigils or festivals they do not heed.\nThe birds do fly, the fish do swim,\nThe bees collect honey, worms do crawl,\nEvery thing travails to obtain its food,\nExcept minstrels and lazy useless thieves.\n\nI deride neither song nor minstrelsy,\nFor they are given by God to lighten thought;\nBut him who abuses them,\nFor blaspheming Jesus and his service.\"\n\n\nTaliesin having set his master free from prison, and having protected\nthe innocence of his wife, and silenced the Bards, so that not one of\nthem dared to say a word, now brought Elphin's wife before them, and\nshowed that she had not one finger wanting.  Right glad was Elphin,\nright glad was Taliesin.\n\nThen he bade Elphin wager the king, that he had a horse both better\nand swifter than the king's horses.  And this Elphin did, and the\nday, and the time, and the place were fixed, and the place was that\nwhich at this day is called Morva Rhiannedd:  and thither the king\nwent with all his people, and four-and-twenty of the swiftest horses\nhe possessed.  And after a long process the course was marked, and\nthe horses were placed for running.  Then came Taliesin with four-\nand-twenty twigs of holly, which he had burnt black, and he caused\nthe youth who was to ride his master's horse to place them in his\nbelt, and he gave him orders to let all the king's horses get before\nhim, and as he should overtake one horse after the other, to take one\nof the twigs and strike the horse with it over the crupper, and then\nlet that twig fall; and after that to take another twig, and do in\nlike manner to every one of the horses, as he should overtake them,\nenjoining the horseman strictly to watch when his own horse should\nstumble, and to throw down his cap on the spot.  All these things did\nthe youth fulfil, giving a blow to every one of the king's horses,\nand throwing down his cap on the spot where his horse stumbled.  And\nto this spot Taliesin brought his master after his horse had won the\nrace.  And he caused Elphin to put workmen to dig a hole there; and\nwhen they had dug the ground deep enough, they found a large cauldron\nfull of gold.  And then said Taliesin, \"Elphin, behold a payment and\nreward unto thee, for having taken me out of the weir, and for having\nreared me from that time until now.\"  And on this spot stands a pool\nof water, which is to this time called Pwllbair.\n\nAfter all this, the king caused Taliesin to be brought before him,\nand he asked him to recite concerning the creation of man from the\nbeginning; and thereupon he made the poem which is now called \"One of\nthe Four Pillars of Song.\"\n\n\n\"The Almighty made,\nDown the Hebron vale,\nWith his plastic hands,\n   Adam's fair form:\n\nAnd five hundred years,\nVoid of any help,\nThere he remained and lay\n   Without a soul.\n\nHe again did form,\nIn calm paradise,\nFrom a left-side rib,\n   Bliss-throbbing Eve.\n\nSeven hours they were\nThe orchard keeping,\nTill Satan brought strife,\n   With wiles from hell.\n\nThence were they driven,\nCold and shivering,\nTo gain their living,\n   Into this world.\n\nTo bring forth with pain\nTheir sons and daughters,\nTo have possession\n   Of Asia's land.\n\nTwice five, ten and eight,\nShe was self-bearing,\nThe mixed burden\n   Of man-woman.\n\nAnd once, not hidden,\nShe brought forth Abel,\nAnd Cain the forlorn,\n   The homicide.\n\nTo him and his mate\nWas given a spade,\nTo break up the soil,\n   Thus to get bread.\n\nThe wheat pure and white,\nSummer tilth to sow,\nEvery man to feed,\n   Till great yule feast.\n\nAn angelic hand\nFrom the high Father,\nBrought seed for growing\n   That Eve might sow;\n\nBut she then did hide\nOf the gift a tenth,\nAnd all did not sow\n   Of what was dug.\n\nBlack rye then was found,\nAnd not pure wheat grain,\nTo show the mischief\n   Thus of thieving.\n\nFor this thievish act,\nIt is requisite,\nThat all men should pay\n   Tithe unto God.\n\nOf the ruddy wine,\nPlanted on sunny days,\nAnd on new-moon nights;\n   And the white wine.\n\nThe wheat rich in grain\nAnd red flowing wine\nChrist's pure body make,\n   Son of Alpha.\n\nThe wafer is flesh,\nThe wine is spilt blood,\nThe Trinity's words\n   Sanctify them.\n\nThe concealed books\nFrom Emmanuel's hand\nWere brought by Raphael\n   As Adam's gift,\n\nWhen in his old age,\nTo his chin immersed\nIn Jordan's water,\n   Keeping a fast,\n\nMoses did obtain\nIn Jordan's water,\nThe aid of the three\n   Most special rods.\n\nSolomon did obtain\nIn Babel's tower,\nAll the sciences\n   In Asia land.\n\nSo did I obtain,\nIn my bardic books,\nAll the sciences\n   Of Europe and Africa.\n\nTheir course, their bearing,\nTheir permitted way,\nAnd their fate I know,\n   Unto the end.\n\nOh! what misery,\nThrough extreme of woe,\nProphecy will show\n   On Troia's race!\n\nA coiling serpent\nProud and merciless,\nOn her golden wings,\n   From Germany.\n\nShe will overrun\nEngland and Scotland,\nFrom Lychlyn sea-shore\n   To the Severn.\n\nThen will the Brython\nBe as prisoners,\nBy strangers swayed,\n   From Saxony.\n\nTheir Lord they will praise,\nTheir speech they will keep,\nTheir land they will lose,\n   Except wild Walia.\n\nTill some change shall come,\nAfter long penance,\nWhen equally rife\n   The two crimes come.\n\nBritons then shall have\nTheir land and their crown,\nAnd the stranger swarm\n   Shall disappear.\n\nAll the angel's words,\nAs to peace and war,\nWill be fulfilled\n   To Britain's race.\"\n\nHe further told the king various prophecies of things that should be\nin the world, in songs, as follows.\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n{1}  It is also stated, that there is in the Hengwrt Library, a MS.\ncontaining the Graal in Welsh, as early as the time of Henry I.
