'You needn't, be such a grandfather,' she\nsuggested helpfully.\"\n\n\"Regarded them with alert eyes\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE EAGLE'S SHADOW\n\n\nI\n\nThis is the story of Margaret Hugonin and of the Eagle. And with your\npermission, we will for the present defer all consideration of the\nbird, and devote our unqualified attention to Margaret.\n\nI have always esteemed Margaret the obvious, sensible, most\nappropriate name that can be bestowed upon a girl-child, for it is a\nname that fits a woman--any woman--as neatly as her proper size in\ngloves.\n\nYes, the first point I wish to make is that a woman-child, once\nbaptised Margaret, is thereby insured of a suitable name. Be she grave\nor gay in after-life, wanton or pious or sullen, comely or otherwise,\nthere will be no possible chance of incongruity; whether she develop a\ntaste for winter-gardens or the higher mathematics, whether she take\nto golf or clinging organdies, the event is provided for. One has only\nto consider for a moment, and if among a choice of Madge, Marjorie,\nMeta, Maggie, Margherita, Peggy, and Gretchen, and countless\nothers--if among all these he cannot find a name that suits her to a\nT--why, then, the case is indeed desperate and he may permissibly\nfall back upon Madam or--if the cat jump propitiously, and at his own\nperil--on Darling or Sweetheart.\n\nThe second proof that this name must be the best of all possible names\nis that Margaret Hugonin bore it. And so the murder is out. You may\nsuspect what you choose. I warn you in advance that I have no part\nwhatever in her story; and if my admiration for her given name appear\nsomewhat excessive, I can only protest that in this dissentient world\nevery one has a right to his own taste. I knew Margaret. I admired\nher. And if in some unguarded moment I may have carried my admiration\nto the point of indiscretion, her husband most assuredly knows all\nabout it, by this, and he and I are still the best of friends. So you\nperceive that if I ever did so far forget myself it could scarcely\nhave amounted to a hanging matter.\n\nI am doubly sure that Margaret Hugonin was beautiful, for the reason\nthat I have never found a woman under forty-five who shared my\nopinion. If you clap a Testament into my hand, I cannot affirm that\nwomen are eager to recognise beauty in one another; at the utmost they\nconcede that this or that particular feature is well enough. But when\na woman is clean-eyed and straight-limbed, and has a cheery heart,\nshe really cannot help being beautiful; and when Nature accords her\na sufficiency of dimples and an infectious laugh, I protest she is\nwell-nigh irresistible. And all these Margaret Hugonin had.\n\nAnd surely that is enough.\n\nI shall not endeavour, then, to picture her features to you in any\nnicely picked words. Her chief charm was that she was Margaret.\n\nAnd besides that, mere carnal vanities are trivial things; a gray\neye or so is not in the least to the purpose. Yet since it is the\nimmemorial custom of writer-folk to inventory such possessions of\ntheir heroines, here you have a catalogue of her personal attractions.\nLaunce's method will serve our turn.\n\nImprimis, there was not very much of her--five feet three, at the\nmost; and hers was the well-groomed modern type that implies a\ngrandfather or two and is in every respect the antithesis of that\nhulking Venus of the Louvre whom people pretend to admire. Item, she\nhad blue eyes; and when she talked with you, her head drooped forward\na little. The frank, intent gaze of these eyes was very flattering\nand, in its ultimate effect, perilous, since it led you fatuously to\nbelieve that she had forgotten there were any other trousered beings\nextant. Later on you found this a decided error. Item, she had a quite\nincredible amount of yellow hair, that was not in the least like gold\nor copper or bronze--I scorn the hackneyed similes of metallurgical\npoets--but a straightforward yellow, darkening at the roots; and she\nwore it low down on her neck in great coils that were held in place\nby a multitude of little golden hair-pins and divers corpulent\ntortoise-shell ones. Item, her nose was a tiny miracle of perfection;\nand this was noteworthy, for you will observe that Nature, who is an\nadept at eyes and hair and mouths, very rarely achieves a creditable\nnose. Item, she had a mouth; and if you are a Gradgrindian with a\ntaste for hairsplitting, I cannot swear that it was a particularly\nsmall mouth. The lips were rather full than otherwise; one saw in them\npotentialities of heroic passion, and tenderness, and generosity, and,\nif you will, temper. No, her mouth was not in the least like the pink\nshoe-button of romance and sugared portraiture; it was manifestly\ndesigned less for simpering out of a gilt frame or the dribbling of\nstock phrases over three hundred pages than for gibes and laughter\nand cheery gossip and honest, unromantic eating, as well as another\npurpose, which, as a highly dangerous topic, I decline even to\nmention.\n\nThere you have the best description of Margaret Hugonin that I am\ncapable of giving you. No one realises its glaring inadequacy more\nacutely than I.\n\nFurthermore, I stipulate that if in the progress of our comedy she\nappear to act with an utter lack of reason or even common-sense--as\nevery woman worth the winning must do once or twice in a\nlifetime--that I be permitted to record the fact, to set it down in\nall its ugliness, nay, even to exaggerate it a little--all to the end\nthat I may eventually exasperate you and goad you into crying out,\n\"Come, come, you are not treating the girl with common justice!\"\n\nFor, if such a thing were possible, I should desire you to rival even\nme in a liking for Margaret Hugonin. And speaking for myself, I can\nassure you that I have come long ago to regard her faults with the\nsame leniency that I accord my own.\n\n\n\nII\n\nWe begin on a fine May morning in Colonel Hugonin's rooms at Selwoode,\nwhich is, as you may or may not know, the Hugonins' country-place.\nAnd there we discover the Colonel dawdling over his breakfast, in an\nintermediate stage of that careful toilet which enables him later in\nthe day to pass casual inspection as turning forty-nine.\n\nAt present the old gentleman is discussing the members of his\ndaughter's house-party. We will omit, by your leave, a number of\npicturesque descriptive passages--for the Colonel is, on occasion, a\nman of unfettered speech--and come hastily to the conclusion, to the\nsumming-up of the whole matter.\n\n\"Altogether,\" says Colonel Hugonin, \"they strike me as being the most\nungodly menagerie ever gotten together under one roof since Noah\nlanded on Ararat.\"\n\nNow, I am sorry that veracity compels me to present the Colonel\nin this particular state of mind, for ordinarily he was as\npleasant-spoken a gentleman as you will be apt to meet on the\nlongest summer day.\n\n[Illustration: \"'Altogether,' says Colonel Hugonin, 'they strike me as\nbeing the most ungodly menagerie ever gotten together under one roof\nsince Noah landed on Ararat.'\"]\n\nYou must make allowances for the fact that, on this especial morning,\nhe was still suffering from a recent twinge of the gout, and that his\ntoast was somewhat dryer than he liked it; and, most potent of all,\nthat the foreign mail, just in, had caused him to rebel anew against\nthe proprieties and his daughter's inclinations, which chained him to\nSelwoode, in the height of the full London season, to preside over a\nhouse-party every member of which he cordially disliked. Therefore,\nthe Colonel having glanced through the well-known names of those at\nLady Pevensey's last cotillion, groaned and glared at his daughter,\nwho sat opposite him, and reviled his daughter's friends with point\nand fluency, and characterised them as above, for the reason that he\nwas hungered at heart for the shady side of Pall Mall, and that their\npresence at Selwoode prevented his attaining this Elysium. For, I am\nsorry to say that the Colonel loathed all things American, saving his\ndaughter, whom he worshipped.\n\nAnd, I think, no one who could have seen her preparing his second cup\nof tea would have disputed that in making this exception he acted with\na show of reason. For Margaret Hugonin--but, as you know, she is\nour heroine, and, as I fear you have already learned, words are very\npaltry makeshifts when it comes to describing her. Let us simply say,\nthen, that Margaret, his daughter, began to make him a cup of tea, and\nadd that she laughed.\n\nNot unkindly; no, for at bottom she adored her father--a comely\nEnglishman of some sixty-odd, who had run through his wife's fortune\nand his own, in the most gallant fashion--and she accorded his\nopinions a conscientious, but at times, a sorely taxed, tolerance.\nThat very month she had reached twenty-three, the age of omniscience,\nwhen the fallacies and general obtuseness of older people become\ndishearteningly apparent.\n\n\"It's nonsense,\" pursued the old gentleman, \"utter, bedlamite\nnonsense, filling Selwoode up with writing people! Never heard of such\na thing. Gad, I do remember, as a young man, meeting Thackeray at a\ngarden-party at Orleans House--gentlemanly fellow with a broken nose--\nand Browning went about a bit, too, now I think of it. People had 'em\none at a time to lend flavour to a dinner--like an olive; we didn't\ndine on olives, though. You have 'em for breakfast, luncheon, dinner,\nand everything! I'm sick of olives, I tell you, Margaret!\" Margaret\npouted.\n\n\"They ain't even good olives. I looked into one of that fellow\nCharteris's books the other day--that chap you had here last week.\nIt was bally rot--proverbs standing on their heads and grinning\nlike dwarfs in a condemned street-fair! Who wants to be told that\nimpropriety is the spice of life and that a roving eye gathers\nremorse? _You_ may call that sort of thing cleverness, if you like; I\ncall it damn' foolishness.\" And the emphasis with which he said this\nleft no doubt that the Colonel spoke his honest opinion.\n\n\"Attractive,\" said his daughter patiently, \"Mr. Charteris is very,\nvery clever. Mr. Kennaston says literature suffered a considerable\nloss when he began to write for the magazines.\"\n\nAnd now that Margaret has spoken, permit me to call your attention to\nher voice. Mellow and suave and of astonishing volume was Margaret's\nvoice; it came not from the back of her throat, as most of our women's\nvoices do, but from her chest; and I protest it had the timbre of a\nviolin. Men, hearing her voice for the first time, were wont to stare\nat her a little and afterward to close their hands slowly, for always\nits modulations had the tonic sadness of distant music, and it\nthrilled you to much the same magnanimity and yearning, cloudily\nconceived; and yet you could not but smile in spite of yourself at the\nquaint emphasis fluttering through her speech and pouncing for the\nmost part on the unlikeliest word in the whole sentence.\n\nBut I fancy the Colonel must have been tone-deaf. \"Don't you make\nphrases for me!\" he snorted; \"you keep 'em for your menagerie Think!\nBy gad, the world never thinks. I believe the world deliberately\nreads the six bestselling books in order to incapacitate itself for\nthinking.\" Then, his wrath gathering emphasis as he went on: \"The\nlonger I live the plainer I see Shakespeare was right--what\nfools these mortals be, and all that. There's that Haggage\nwoman--speech-making through the country like a hiatused politician.\nIt may be philanthropic, but it ain't ladylike--no, begad! What has\nshe got to do with Juvenile Courts and child-labour in the South, I'd\nlike to know? Why ain't she at home attending to that crippled boy\nof hers--poor little beggar!--instead of flaunting through America\nmeddling with other folk's children?\"\n\nMiss Hugonin put another lump of sugar into his cup and deigned no\nreply.\n\n\"By gad,\" cried the Colonel fervently, \"if you're so anxious to spend\nthat money of yours in charity, why don't you found a Day Nursery for\nthe Children of Philanthropists--a place where advanced men and women\ncan leave their offspring in capable hands when they're busied with\nMothers' Meetings and Educational Conferences? It would do a thousand\ntimes more good, I can tell you, than that fresh kindergarten scheme\nof yours for teaching the children of the labouring classes to make a\nnew sort of mud-pie.\"\n\n\"You don't understand these things, attractive,\" Margaret gently\npointed out. \"You aren't in harmony with the trend of modern thought.\"\n\n\"No, thank God!\" said the Colonel, heartily.\n\nEnsued a silence during which he chipped at his egg-shell in an\nabsent-minded fashion.\n\n\"That fellow Kennaston said anything to you yet?\" he presently\nqueried.\n\n\"I--I don't understand,\" she protested--oh, perfectly unconvincingly.\nThe tea-making, too, engrossed her at this point to an utterly\nimprobable extent.\n\nThus it shortly befell that the Colonel, still regarding her under\nintent brows, cleared his throat and made bold to question her\ngenerosity in the matter of sugar; five lumps being, as he suggested,\na rather unusual allowance for one cup.\n\nThen, \"Mr. Kennaston and I are very good friends,\" said she, with\ndignity. And having spoiled the first cup in the making, she began on\nanother.\n\n\"Glad to hear it,\" growled the old gentleman. \"I hope you value his\nfriendship sufficiently not to marry him. The man's a fraud--a flimsy,\nsickening fraud, like his poetry, begad, and that's made up of botany\nand wide margins and indecency in about equal proportions. It ain't\nfit for a woman to read--in fact, a woman ought not to read anything;\na comprehension of the Decalogue and the cookery-book is enough\nlearning for the best of 'em. Your mother never--never--\"\n\nColonel Hugonin paused and stared at the open window for a little. He\nseemed to be interested in something a great way off.\n\n\"We used to read Ouida's books together,\" he said, somewhat wistfully.\n\"Lord, Lord, how she revelled in Chandos and Bertie Cecil and those\ndashing Life Guardsmen! And she used to toss that little head of hers\nand say I was a finer figure of a man than any of 'em--thirty\nyears ago, good Lord! And I was then, but I ain't now. I'm only a\nbroken-down, cantankerous old fool,\" declared the Colonel, blowing\nhis nose violently, \"and that's why I'm quarrelling with the dearest,\nfoolishest daughter man ever had. Ah, my dear, don't mind me--run your\nmenagerie as you like, and I'll stand it.\"\n\nMargaret adopted her usual tactics; she perched herself on the arm\nof his chair and began to stroke his cheek very gently. She\noften wondered as to what dear sort of a woman that tender-eyed,\npink-cheeked mother of the old miniature had been--the mother who had\ndied when she was two years old. She loved the idea of her, vague as\nit was. And, just now, somehow, the notion of two grown people reading\nOuida did not strike her as being especially ridiculous.\n\n\"Was she very beautiful?\" she asked, softly.\n\n\"My dear,\" said her father, \"you are the picture of her.\"\n\n\"You dangerous old man!\" said she, laughing and rubbing her cheek\nagainst his in a manner that must have been highly agreeable. \"Dear,\ndo you know that is the nicest little compliment I've had for a long\ntime?\"\n\nThereupon the Colonel chuckled. \"Pay me for it, then,\" said he, \"by\ndriving the dog-cart over to meet Billy's train to-day. Eh?\"\n\n\"I--I can't,\" said Miss Hugonin, promptly.\n\n\"Why?\" demanded her father.\n\n\"Because----\" said Miss Hugonin; and after giving this really\nexcellent reason, reflected for a moment and strengthened it by\nadding, \"Because----\"\n\n\"See here,\" her father questioned, \"what did you two quarrel about,\nanyway?\"\n\n\"I--I really don't remember,\" said she, reflectively; then continued,\nwith hauteur and some inconsistency, \"I am not aware that Mr. Woods\nand I have ever quarrelled.\"\n\n\"By gad, then,\" said the Colonel, \"you may as well prepare to, for\nI intend to marry you to Billy some day. Dear, dear, child,\" he\ninterpolated, with malice aforethought, \"have you a fever?--your\ncheek's like a coal. Billy's a man, I tell you--worth a dozen of your\nKennastons and Charterises. I like Billy. And besides, it's only right\nhe should have Selwoode--wasn't he brought up to expect it? It\nain't right he should lose it simply because he had a quarrel with\nFrederick, for, by gad--not to speak unkindly of the dead, my\ndear--Frederick quarrelled with every one he ever knew, from the woman\nwho nursed him to the doctor who gave him his last pill. He may have\ngotten his genius for money-making from Heaven, but he certainly\ngot his temper from the devil. I really believe,\" said the Colonel,\nreflectively, \"it was worse than mine. Yes, not a doubt of it--I'm a\nlamb in comparison. But he had his way, after all; and even now poor\nBilly can't get Selwoode without taking you with it,\" and he caught\nhis daughter's face between his hands and turned it toward his for a\nmoment. \"I wonder now,\" said he, in meditative wise, \"if Billy will\nconsider that a drawback?\"\n\nIt seemed very improbable. Any number of marriageable males would have\nsworn it was unthinkable.\n\nHowever, \"Of course,\" Margaret began, in a crisp voice, \"if you advise\nMr. Woods to marry me as a good speculation--\"\n\nBut her father caught her up, with a whistle. \"Eh?\" said he. \"Love in\na cottage?--is it thus the poet turns his lay? That's damn' nonsense!\nI tell you, even in a cottage the plumber's bill has to be paid, and\nthe grocer's little account settled every month. Yes, by gad, and\neven if you elect to live on bread and cheese and kisses, you'll find\nCamembert a bit more to your taste than Sweitzer.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to marry anybody, you ridiculous old dear,\" said\nMargaret.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said the old gentleman; \"don't. Be an old maid, and\nlecture before the Mothers' Club, if you like. I don't care. Anyhow,\nyou meet Billy to-day at twelve-forty-five. You will?--that's a good\nchild. Now run along and tell the menagerie I'll be down-stairs as\nsoon as I've finished dressing.\"\n\nAnd the Colonel rang for his man and proceeded to finish his toilet.\nHe seemed a thought absent-minded this morning.\n\n\"I say, Wilkins,\" he questioned, after a little. \"Ever read any of\nOuida's books?\"\n\n\"Ho, yes, sir,\" said Wilkins; \"Miss 'Enderson--Mrs. 'Aggage's maid,\nthat his, sir--was reading haloud hout hof 'Hunder Two Flags' honly\nlast hevening, sir.\"\n\n\"H'm--Wilkins--if you can run across one of them in the servants'\nquarters--you might leave it--by my bed--to-night.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And--h'm, Wilkins--you can put it under that book of Herbert\nSpencer's my daughter gave me yesterday. _Under_ it, Wilkins--and,\nh'm, Wilkins--you needn't mention it to anybody. Ouida ain't cultured,\nWilkins, but she's damn' good reading. I suppose that's why she ain't\ncultured, Wilkins.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nAnd now let us go back a little. In a word, let us utilise the next\ntwenty minutes--during which Miss Hugonin drives to the neighbouring\nrailway station, in, if you press me, not the most pleasant state of\nmind conceivable--by explaining a thought more fully the posture of\naffairs at Selwoode on the May morning that starts our story.\n\nAnd to do this I must commence with the nature of the man who founded\nSelwoode.\n\nIt was when the nineteenth century was still a hearty octogenarian\nthat Frederick R. Woods caused Selwoode to be builded. I give you the\nname by which he was known on \"the Street.\" A mythology has grown\nabout the name since, and strange legends of its owner are still\nnarrated where brokers congregate. But with the lambs he sheared, and\nthe bulls he dragged to earth, and the bears he gored to financial\ndeath, we have nothing to do; suffice it, that he performed these\noperations with almost uniform success and in an unimpeachably\nrespectable manner.\n\nAnd if, in his time, he added materially to the lists of inmates in\nvarious asylums and almshouses, it must be acknowledged that he bore\nhis victims no malice, and that on every Sunday morning he confessed\nhimself to be a miserable sinner, in a voice that was perfectly\naudible three pews off. At bottom, I think he considered his relations\nwith Heaven on a purely business basis; he kept a species of running\naccount with Providence; and if on occasions he overdrew it somewhat,\nhe saw no incongruity in evening matters with a cheque for the church\nfund.\n\nSo that at his death it was said of him that he had, in his day, sent\nmore men into bankruptcy and more missionaries into Africa than any\nother man in the country.\n\nIn his sixty-fifth year, he caught Alfred Van Orden short in Lard,\nerected a memorial window to his wife and became a country gentleman.\nHe never set foot in Wall Street again. He builded Selwoode--a\nhandsome Tudor manor which stands some seven miles from the village of\nFairhaven--where he dwelt in state, by turns affable and domineering\nto the neighbouring farmers, and evincing a grave interest in the\ncondition of their crops. He no longer turned to the financial reports\nin the papers; and the pedigree of the Woodses hung in the living-hall\nfor all men to see, beginning gloriously with Woden, the Scandinavian\ngod, and attaining a respectable culmination in the names of Frederick\nR. Woods and of William, his brother.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that he omitted to supply himself with a\ncoat-of-arms. Frederick R. Woods evinced an almost childlike pride in\nhis heraldic blazonings.\n\n\"The Woods arms,\" he would inform you, with a relishing gusto, \"are\nvert, an eagle displayed, barry argent and gules. And the crest is\nout of a ducal coronet, or, a demi-eagle proper. We have no motto,\nsir--none of your ancient coats have mottoes.\"\n\nThe Woods Eagle he gloried in. The bird was perched in every available\nnook at Selwoode; it was carved in the woodwork, was set in the\nmosaics, was chased in the tableware, was woven in the napery, was\nglazed in the very china. Turn where you would, an eagle or two\nconfronted you; and Hunston Wyke, who is accounted something of a\nwit, swore that Frederick R. Woods at Selwoode reminded him of \"a\nsore-headed bear who had taken up permanent quarters in an aviary.\"\n\nThere was one, however, who found the bear no very untractable\nmonster. This was the son of his brother, dead now, who dwelt at\nSelwoode as heir presumptive. Frederick R. Woods's wife had died long\nago, leaving him childless. His brother's boy was an orphan; and so,\nfor a time, he and the grim old man lived together peaceably enough.\nIndeed, Billy Woods was in those days as fine a lad as you would wish\nto see, with the eyes of an inquisitive cherub and a big tow-head,\nwhich Frederick R. Woods fell into the habit of cuffing heartily, in\norder to conceal the fact that he would have burned Selwoode to the\nground rather than allow any one else to injure a hair of it.\n\nIn the consummation of time, Billy, having attained the ripe age of\neighteen, announced to his uncle that he intended to become a famous\npainter. Frederick R. Woods exhorted him not to be a fool, and packed\nhim off to college.\n\nBilly Woods returned on his first vacation with a fragmentary mustache\nand any quantity of paint-tubes, canvases, palettes, mahl-sticks, and\nsuch-like paraphernalia. Frederick R. Woods passed over the mustache,\nand had the painters' trappings burned by the second footman. Billy\npromptly purchased another lot. His uncle came upon them one morning,\nrubbed his chin meditatively for a moment, and laughed for the first\ntime, so far as known, in his lifetime; then he tiptoed to his own\napartments, lest Billy--the lazy young rascal was still abed in the\nnext room--should awaken and discover his knowledge of this act of\nflat rebellion.\n\nI dare say the old gentleman was so completely accustomed to having\nhis own way that this unlooked-for opposition tickled him by its\nnovelty; or perhaps he recognised in Billy an obstinacy akin to his\nown; or perhaps it was merely that he loved the boy. In any event, he\nnever again alluded to the subject; and it is a fact that when\nBilly sent for carpenters to convert an upper room into an atelier,\nFrederick R. Woods spent two long and dreary weeks in Boston in order\nto remain in ignorance of the entire affair.\n\nBilly scrambled through college, somehow, in the allotted four years.\nAt the end of that time, he returned to find new inmates installed at\nSelwoode.\n\nFor the wife of Frederick R. Woods had been before her marriage one of\nthe beautiful Anstruther sisters, who, as certain New Yorkers still\nremember--those grizzled, portly, rosy-gilled fellows who prattle\non provocation of Jenny Lind and Castle Garden, and remember\neverything--created a pronounced furor at their d\u00e9but in the days of\ncrinoline and the Grecian bend; and Margaret Anstruther, as they\nwill tell you, was married to Thomas Hugonin, then a gallant cavalry\nofficer in the service of Her Majesty, the Empress of India.\n\nAnd she must have been the nicer of the two, because everybody who\nknew her says that Margaret Hugonin is exactly like her.\n\nSo it came about naturally enough, that Billy Woods, now an _Artium\nBaccalaureus_, if you please, and not a little proud of it, found the\nColonel and his daughter, then on a visit to this country, installed\nat Selwoode as guests and quasi-relatives. And Billy was twenty-two,\nand Margaret was nineteen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrecisely what happened I am unable to tell you. Billy Woods claims\nit is none of my business; and Margaret says that it was a long, long\ntime ago and she really can't remember.\n\nBut I fancy we can all form a very fair notion of what is most likely\nto occur when two sensible, normal, healthy young people are thrown\ntogether in this intimate fashion at a country-house where the\nremaining company consists of two elderly gentlemen. Billy was forced\nto be polite to his uncle's guest; and Margaret couldn't well be\ndiscourteous to her host's nephew, could she? Of course not: so\nit befell in the course of time that Frederick R. Woods and the\nColonel--who had quickly become a great favourite, by virtue of his\nimplicit faith in the Eagle and in Woden and Sir Percival de Wode of\nHastings, and such-like flights of heraldic fancy, and had augmented\nhis popularity by his really brilliant suggestion of Wynkyn de Worde,\nthe famous sixteenth-century printer, as a probable collateral\nrelation of the family--it came to pass, I say, that the two gentlemen\nnodded over their port and chuckled, and winked at one another and\nagreed that the thing would do.\n\nThis was all very well; but they failed to make allowances for the\ninevitable quarrel and the subsequent spectacle of the gentleman\ncontemplating suicide and the lady looking wistfully toward a nunnery.\nIn this case it arose, I believe, over Teddy Anstruther, who for a\ncousin was undeniably very attentive to Margaret; and in the natural\ncourse of events they would have made it up before the week was out\nhad not Frederick R. Woods selected this very moment to interfere in\nthe matter.\n\nAh, _si vieillesse savait!_\n\nThe blundering old man summoned Billy into his study and ordered him\nto marry Margaret Hugonin, precisely as the Colonel might have ordered\na private to go on sentry-duty. Ten days earlier Billy would have\njumped at the chance; ten days later he would probably have suggested\nit himself; but at that exact moment he would have as willingly\ncontemplated matrimony with Alecto or Medusa or any of the Furies.\nAccordingly, he declined. Frederick R. Woods flew into a pyrotechnical\ndisplay of temper, and gave him his choice between obeying his\ncommands and leaving his house forever--the choice, in fact, which he\nhad been according Billy at very brief intervals ever since the boy\nhad had the measles, fifteen years before, and had refused to take the\nproper medicines.\n\nIt was merely his usual manner of expressing a request or a\nsuggestion. But this time, to his utter horror and amaze, the boy took\nhim at his word and left Selwoode within the hour.\n\nBilly's life, you see, was irrevocably blighted. It mattered very\nlittle what became of him; personally, he didn't care in the least.\nBut as for that fair, false, fickle woman--perish the thought! Sooner\na thousand deaths! No, he would go to Paris and become a painter of\nworldwide reputation; the money his father had left him would easily\nsuffice for his simple wants. And some day, the observed of all\nobservers in some bright hall of gaiety, he would pass her coldly by,\nwith a cynical smile upon his lips, and she would grow pale and totter\nand fall into the arms of the bloated Silenus, for whose title she had\nbartered her purely superficial charms.\n\nYes, upon mature deliberation, that was precisely what Billy decided\nto do.\n\nFollowed dark days at Selwoode. Frederick R. Woods told Margaret of\nwhat had occurred; and he added the information that, as his wife's\nnearest relative, he intended to make her his heir.\n\nThen Margaret did what I would scarcely have expected of Margaret.\nShe turned upon him like a virago and informed Frederick R. Woods\nprecisely what she thought of him; she acquainted him with the fact\nthat he was a sordid, low-minded, grasping beast, and a miser, and\na tyrant, and (I think) a parricide; she notified him that he was\nthoroughly unworthy to wipe the dust off his nephew's shoes--an\noffice toward which, to do him justice, he had never shown any marked\naspirations--and that Billy had acted throughout in a most noble and\nsensible manner; and that, personally, she wouldn't marry Billy Woods\nif he were the last man on earth, for she had always despised him; and\nshe added the information that she expected to die shortly, and she\nhoped they would both be sorry _then_; and subsequently she clapped\nthe climax by throwing her arms about his neck and bursting into tears\nand telling him he was the dearest old man in the world and that she\nwas thoroughly ashamed of herself.\n\nSo they kissed and made it up. And after a little the Colonel and\nMargaret went away from Selwoode, and Frederick R. Woods was left\nalone to nourish his anger and indignation, if he could, and to hunger\nfor his boy, whether he would or not. He was too proud to seek him\nout; indeed, he never thought of that; and so he waited alone in his\nfine house, sick at heart, impotent, hoping against hope that the boy\nwould come back. The boy never came.\n\nNo, the boy never came, because he was what the old man had made\nhim--headstrong, and wilful, and obstinate. Billy had been thoroughly\nspoiled. The old man had nurtured his pride, had applauded it as a\nmark of proper spirit; and now it was this same pride that had robbed\nhim of the one thing he loved in all the world.\n\nSo, at last, the weak point in the armour of this sturdy old Pharisee\nwas found, and Fate had pierced it gaily. It was retribution, if you\nwill; and I think that none of his victims in \"the Street,\" none of\nthe countless widows and orphans that he had made, suffered more\nbitterly than he in those last days.\n\nIt was almost two years after Billy's departure from Selwoode that his\nbody-servant, coming to rouse Frederick R. Woods one June morning,\nfound him dead in his rooms. He had been ailing for some time. It\nwas his heart, the doctors said; and I think that it was, though not\nprecisely in the sense which they meant.\n\nThe man found him seated before his great carved desk, on which his\nhead and shoulders had fallen forward; they rested on a sheet of\nlegal-cap paper half-covered with a calculation in his crabbed old\nhand as to the value of certain properties--the calculation which he\nnever finished; and underneath was a mass of miscellaneous papers,\namong them his will, dated the day after Billy left Selwoode, in which\nFrederick R. Woods bequeathed his millions unconditionally to Margaret\nHugonin when she should come of age.\n\nHer twenty-first birthday had fallen in the preceding month. So\nMargaret was one of the richest women in America; and you may depend\nupon it, that if many men had loved her before, they worshipped her\nnow--or, at least, said they did, and, after all, their protestations\nwere the only means she had of judging. She might have been a\ncountess--and it must be owned that the old Colonel, who had an honest\nAnglo-Saxon reverence for a title, saw this chance lost wistfully--and\nshe might have married any number of grammarless gentlemen, personally\nunknown to her, whose fervent proposals almost every mail brought in;\nand besides these, there were many others, more orthodox in their\nwooing, some of whom were genuinely in love with Margaret Hugonin, and\nsome--I grieve to admit it--who were genuinely in love with her money;\nand she would have none of them.\n\nShe refused them all with the utmost civility, as I happen to know.\nHow I learned it is no affair of yours.\n\nFor Miss Hugonin had remarkably keen eyes, which she used to\nadvantage. In the world about her they discovered very little that she\ncould admire. She was none the happier for her wealth; the piled-up\nmillions overshadowed her personality; and it was not long before she\nknew that most people regarded her simply as the heiress of the Woods\nfortune--an unavoidable encumbrance attached to the property, which\ndivers thrifty-minded gentlemen were willing to put up with. To put up\nwith!--at the thought, her pride rose in a hot blush, and, it must be\nconfessed, she sought consolation in the looking-glass.\n\nShe was an humble-minded young woman, as the sex goes, and she saw no\ngreat reason there why a man should go mad over Margaret Hugonin. This\ndecision, I grant you, was preposterous, for there were any number of\nreasons. Her final conclusion, however, was for the future to regard\nall men as fortune-hunters and to do her hair differently.\n\nShe carried out both resolutions. When a gentleman grew pressing in\nhis attentions, she more than suspected his motives; and when she\neventually declined him it was done with perfect, courtesy, but the\nglow of her eyes was at such times accentuated to a marked degree.\n\nMeanwhile, the Eagle brooded undisturbed at Selwoode. Miss Hugonin\nwould allow nothing to be altered.\n\n\"The place doesn't belong to me, attractive,\" she would tell her\nfather. \"I belong to the place. Yes, I do--I'm exactly like a little\ncow thrown in with a little farm when they sell it, and _all_ my\nlittle suitors think so, and they are very willing to take me on those\nterms, too. But they shan't, attractive. I hate every single solitary\nman in the whole wide world but you, beautiful, and I particularly\nhate that horrid old Eagle; but we'll keep him because he's a constant\nreminder to me that Solomon or Moses, or whoever it was that said all\nmen were liars, was a person of _very_ great intelligence.\"\n\nSo that I think we may fairly say the money did her no good.\n\nIf it benefited no one else, it was not Margaret's fault. She had a\nhigh sense of her responsibilities, and therefore, at various times,\nendeavoured to further the spread of philanthropy and literature and\ntheosophy and art and temperance and education and other laudable\ncauses. Mr. Kennaston, in his laughing manner, was wont to jest at\nher varied enterprises and term her Lady Bountiful; but, then, Mr.\nKennaston had no real conception of the proper uses of money. In\nfact, he never thought of money. He admitted this to Margaret with a\nwhimsical sigh.\n\nMargaret grew very fond of Mr. Kennaston because he was not mercenary.\n\nMr. Kennaston was much at Selwoode. Many people came there\nnow--masculine women and muscleless men, for the most part. They had,\nevery one of them, some scheme for bettering the universe; and if\namong them Margaret seemed somewhat out of place--a butterfly among\nearnest-minded ants--her heart was in every plan they advocated, and\nthey found her purse-strings infinitely elastic. The girl was pitiably\nanxious to be of some use in the world.\n\nSo at Selwoode they gossiped of great causes and furthered the\nmillenium. And above them the Eagle brooded in silence.\n\nAnd Billy? All this time Billy was junketing abroad, where every\nyear he painted masterpieces for the Salon, which--on account of a\nnefarious conspiracy among certain artists, jealous of his superior\nmerits--were invariably refused.\n\nNow Billy is back again in America, and the Colonel has insisted that\nhe come to Selwoode, and Margaret is waiting for him in the dog-cart.\nThe glow of her eyes is very, very bright. Her father's careless words\nthis morning, coupled with certain speeches of Mr. Kennaston's last\nnight, have given her food for reflection.\n\n\"He wouldn't dare,\" says Margaret, to no one in particular. \"Oh, no,\nhe wouldn't dare after what happened four years ago.\"\n\nAnd, Margaret-like, she has quite forgotten that what happened four\nyears ago was all caused by her having flirted outrageously with Teddy\nAnstruther, in order to see what Billy would do.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe twelve forty-five, for a wonder, was on time; and there descended\nfrom it a big, blond young man, who did not look in the least like a\nfortune-hunter.\n\nMiss Hugonin resented this. Manifestly, he looked clean and honest for\nthe deliberate purpose of deceiving her. Very well! She'd show him!\n\nHe was quite unembarrassed. He shook hands cordially; then he shook\nhands with the groom, who, you may believe it, was grinning in a most\nunprofessional manner because Master Billy was back again at Selwoode.\nSubsequently, in his old decisive way, he announced they would walk to\nthe house, as his legs needed stretching.\n\nThe insolence of it!--quite as if he had something to say to Margaret\nin private and couldn't wait a minute. Beyond doubt, this was a young\nman who must be taken down a peg or two, and that at once. Of course,\nshe wasn't going to walk back with him!--a pretty figure they'd cut\nstrolling through the fields, like a house-girl and the milkman on a\nSunday afternoon! She would simply say she was too tired to walk, and\nthat would end the matter.\n\nSo she said she thought the exercise would do them both good.\n\nThey came presently with desultory chat to a meadow bravely decked in\nall the gauds of Spring. About them the day was clear, the air bland.\nSpring had revamped her ageless fripperies of tender leaves and\nbird-cries and sweet, warm odours for the adornment of this meadow;\nabove it she had set a turkis sky splashed here and there with little\nclouds that were like whipped cream; and upon it she had scattered\nlargesse, a Dana\u00eb's shower of buttercups. Altogether, she had made of\nit a particularly dangerous meadow for a man and a maid to frequent.\n\nYet there Mr. Woods paused under a burgeoning maple--paused\nresolutely, with the lures of Spring thick about him, compassed with\nevery snare of scent and sound and colour that the witch is mistress\nof.\n\nMargaret hoped he had a pleasant passage over. Her father, thank you,\nwas in the pink of condition. Oh, yes, she was quite well. She hoped\nMr. Woods would not find America--\n\n\"Well, Peggy,\" said Mr. Woods, \"then, we'll have it out right here.\"\n\nHis insolence was so surprising that--in order to recover\nherself--Margaret actually sat down under the maple-tree. Peggy,\nindeed! Why, she hadn't been called Peggy for--no, not for four whole\nyears!\n\n\"Because I intend to be friends, you know,\" said Mr. Woods.\n\nAnd about them the maple-leaves made a little island of sombre green,\naround which more vivid grasses rippled and dimpled under the fitful\nspring breezes. And everywhere leaves lisped to one another, and birds\nshrilled insistently. It was a perilous locality.\n\nI fancy Billy Woods was out of his head when he suggested being\nfriends in such a place. Friends, indeed!--you would have thought from\nthe airy confidence with which he spoke that Margaret had come safely\nto forty year and wore steel-rimmed spectacles!\n\nBut Miss Hugonin merely cast down her eyes and was aware of no reason\nwhy they shouldn't be. She was sure he must be hungry, and she thought\nluncheon must be ready by now.\n\nIn his soul, Mr. Woods observed that her lashes were long--long beyond\nall reason. Lacking the numbers that Petrarch flowed in, he did not\nventure, even to himself, to characterise them further. But oh, how\nqueer it was they should be pure gold at the roots!--she must have\ndipped them in the ink-pot. And oh, the strong, sudden, bewildering\ncurve of 'em! He could not recall at the present moment ever noticing\nquite such lashes anywhere else. No, it was highly improbable that\nthere were such lashes anywhere else. Perhaps a few of the superior\nangels might have such lashes. He resolved for the future to attend\nchurch more regularly.\n\nAloud, Mr. Woods observed that in that case they had better shake\nhands.\n\nIt would have been ridiculous to contest the point. The dignified\ncourse was to shake hands, since he insisted on it, and then to return\nat once to Selwoode.\n\nMargaret Hugonin had a pretty hand, and Mr. Woods, as an artist, could\nnot well fail to admire it. Still, he needn't have looked at it as\nthough he had never before seen anything quite like it; he needn't\nhave neglected to return it; and when Miss Hugonin reclaimed it, after\na decent interval, he needn't have laughed in a manner that compelled\nher to laugh, too. These things were unnecessary and annoying, as they\ncaused Margaret to forget that she despised him.\n\n[Illustration: \"Then, for no apparent reason, Margaret flushed, and\nBilly ... thought it vastly becoming\"]\n\nFor the time being--will you believe it?--she actually thought he was\nrather nice.\n\n\"I acted like an ass,\" said Mr. Woods, tragically. \"Oh, yes, I did,\nyou know. But if you'll forgive me for having been an ass I'll forgive\nyou for throwing me over for Teddy Anstruther, and at the wedding I'll\ndance through any number of pairs of patent-leathers you choose to\nmention.\"\n\nSo that was the way he looked at it. Teddy Anstruther, indeed! Why,\nTeddy was a dark little man with brown eyes--just the sort of man she\nmost objected to. How could any one ever possibly fancy a brown-eyed\nman? Then, for no apparent reason, Margaret flushed, and Billy, who\nhad stretched his great length of limb on the grass beside her, noted\nit with a pair of the bluest eyes in the world and thought it vastly\nbecoming.\n\n\"Billy,\" said she, impulsively--and the name having slipped out once\nby accident, it would have been absurd to call him anything else\nafterward--\"it was horrid of you to refuse to take any of that money.\"\n\n\"But I didn't want it,\" he protested. \"Good Lord, I'd only have done\nsomething foolish with it. It was awfully square of you, Peggy, to\noffer to divide, but I didn't want it, you see. I don't want to be a\nmillionaire, and give up the rest of my life to founding libraries and\nexplaining to people that if they never spend any money on amusements\nthey'll have a great deal by the time they're too old to enjoy it. I'd\nrather paint pictures.\"\n\nSo that I think Margaret must have endeavoured at some time to make\nhim accept part of Frederick R. Woods's money.\n\n\"You make me feel--and look--like a thief,\" she reproved him.\n\nThen Billy laughed a little. \"You don't look in the least like one,\"\nhe reassured her. \"You look like an uncommonly honest, straightforward\nyoung woman,\" Mr. Woods added, handsomely, \"and I don't believe you'd\npurloin under the severest temptation.\"\n\nShe thanked him for his testimonial, with all three dimples in\nevidence.\n\nThis was unsettling. He hedged.\n\n\"Except, perhaps--\" said he.\n\n\"Yes?\" queried Margaret, after a pause.\n\nHowever, she questioned him with her head drooped forward, her brows\nraised; and as this gave him the full effect of her eyes, Mr. Woods\nbecame quite certain that there was, at least, one thing she might be\nexpected to rob him of, and wisely declined to mention it.\n\nMargaret did not insist on knowing what it was. Perhaps she heard it\nthumping under his waistcoat, where it was behaving very queerly.\n\nSo they sat in silence for a while. Then Margaret fell a-humming to\nherself; and the air--will you believe it?--chanced by the purest\naccident to be that foolish, senseless old song they used to sing\ntogether four years ago.\n\nBilly chuckled. \"Let's!\" he obscurely pleaded.\n\nSpring prompted her.\n\n  \"Oh, where have you been, Billy boy?\"\nqueried Margaret's wonderful contralto,\n\n  \"Oh, where have you been, Billy boy, Billy boy?\n  Oh, where have you been, charming Billy?\"\n\nShe sang it in a low, hushed voice, just over her breath. Not looking\nat him, however. And oh, what a voice! thought Billy Woods. A voice\nthat was honey and gold and velvet and all that is most sweet and rich\nand soft in the world! Find me another voice like that, you _prime\ndonne!_ Find me a simile for it, you uninventive poets! Indeed, I'd\nlike to see you do it.\n\nBut he chimed in, nevertheless, with his pleasant throaty baritone,\nand lilted his own part quite creditably.\n\n  \"I've been to seek a wife,\n  She's the joy of my life;\n  She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother\"--\n\nOnly Billy sang it \"father,\" just as they used to do.\n\nAnd then they sang it through, did Margaret and Billy--sang of the\ndimple in her chin and the ringlets in her hair, and of the cherry\npies she achieved with such celerity--sang as they sat in the\nspring-decked meadow every word of that inane old song that is so\nutterly senseless and so utterly unforgettable.\n\nIt was a quite idiotic performance. I set it down to the snares of\nSpring--to her insidious, delightful snares of scent and sound and\ncolour that--for the moment, at least--had trapped these young people\ninto loving life infinitely.\n\nBut I wonder who is responsible for that tatter of rhyme and melody\nthat had come to them from nowhere in particular? Mr. Woods, as he sat\nup at the conclusion of the singing vigorously to applaud, would have\nshared his last possession, his ultimate crust, with that unknown\nbenefactor of mankind. Indeed, though, the heart of Mr. Woods just now\nwas full of loving kindness and capable of any freakish magnanimity.\n\nFor--will it be believed?--Mr. Woods, who four years ago had thrown\nover a fortune and exiled himself from his native land, rather than\npropose marriage to Margaret Hugonin, had no sooner come again into\nher presence and looked once into her perfectly fathomless eyes than\nhe could no more have left her of his own accord than a moth can turn\nhis back to a lighted candle. He had fancied himself entirely cured\nof that boy-and-girl nonsense; his broken heart, after the first few\nmonths, had not interfered in the least with a naturally healthy\nappetite; and, behold, here was the old malady raging again in his\nveins and with renewed fervour.\n\nAnd all because the girl had a pretty face! I think you will agree\nwith me that in the conversation I have recorded Margaret had not\ndisplayed any great wisdom or learning or tenderness or wit, nor,\nin fine, any of the qualities a man might naturally look for in a\nhelpmate. Yet at the precise moment he handed his baggage-check to the\ngroom, Mr. Woods had made up his mind to marry her. In an instant he\nhad fallen head over ears in love; or to whittle accuracy to a point,\nhe had discovered that he had never fallen out of love; and if you had\noffered him an empress or fetched Helen of Troy from the grave for his\ndelectation he would have laughed you to scorn.\n\nIn his defense, I can only plead that Margaret was an unusually\nbeautiful woman. It is all very well to flourish a death's-head at the\nfeast, and bid my lady go paint herself an inch thick, for to this\nfavour she must come; and it is quite true that the reddest lips in\nthe universe may give vent to slander and lies, and the brightest eyes\nbe set in the dullest head, and the most roseate of complexions be\npurchased at the corner drug-store; but, say what you will, a pretty\nwoman is a pretty woman, and while she continue so no amount of\ncommon-sense or experience will prevent a man, on provocation, from\nalluring, coaxing, even entreating her to make a fool of him. We like\nit. And I think they like it, too.\n\nSo Mr. Woods lost his heart on a fine spring morning and was\nunreasonably elated over the fact.\n\nAnd Margaret? Margaret was content.\n\n\n\nV\n\nThey talked for a matter of a half-hour in the fashion aforetime\nrecorded--not very wise nor witty talk, if you will, but very pleasant\nto make. There were many pauses. There was much laughter over nothing\nin particular. There were any number of sentences ambitiously begun\nthat ended nowhere. Altogether, it was just the sort of talk for a man\nand a maid.\n\nYet some twenty minutes later, Mr. Woods, preparing for luncheon in\nthe privacy of his chamber, gave a sudden exclamation. Then he sat\ndown and rumpled his hair thoroughly.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he groaned; \"I'd forgotten all about that damned money!\nOh, you ass!--you abject ass! Why, she's one of the richest women in\nAmerica, and you're only a fifth-rate painter with a paltry thousand\nor so a year! _You_ marry her!--why, I dare say she's refused a\nhundred better men than you! She'd think you were mad! Why, she'd\nthink you were after her money! She--oh, she'd only think you a\nprecious cheeky ass, she would, and she'd be quite right. You _are_ an\nass, Billy Woods! You ought to be locked up in some nice quiet stable,\nwhere your heehawing wouldn't disturb people. You need a keeper, you\ndo!\"\n\nHe sat for some ten minutes, aghast. Afterward he rose and threw back\nhis shoulders and drew a deep breath.\n\n\"No, we aren't an ass,\" he addressed his reflection in the mirror, as\nhe carefully knotted his tie. \"We're only a poor chuckle-headed moth\nwho's been looking at a star too long. It's a bright star, Billy, but\nit isn't for you. So we're going to be sensible now. We're going to\nget a telegram to-morrow that will call us away from Selwoode. We\naren't coming back any more, either. We're simply going to continue\npainting fifth-rate pictures, and hoping that some day she'll find the\nright man and be very, very happy.\"\n\nNevertheless, he decided that a blue tie would look better, and was\nvery particular in arranging it.\n\nAt the same moment Margaret stood before her mirror and tidied her\nhair for luncheon and assured her image in the glass that she was a\nweak-minded fool. She pointed out to herself the undeniable fact that\nBilly, having formerly refused to marry her--oh, ignominy!--seemed\npleasant-spoken enough, now that she had become an heiress. His\nrefusal to accept part of her fortune was a very flimsy device; it\nsimply meant he hoped to get all of it. Oh, he did, did he!\n\nMargaret powdered her nose viciously.\n\n_She_ saw through him! His honest bearing she very plainly perceived\nto be the result of consummate hypocrisy. In his laughter her keen ear\ndetected a hollow ring; and his courteous manner she found, at bottom,\nmere servility. And finally she demonstrated--to her own satisfaction,\nat least--that his charm of manner was of exactly the, same sort that\nhad been possessed by many other eminently distinguished criminals.\n\nHow did she do this? My dear sir, you had best inquire of your mother\nor your sister or your wife, or any other lady that your fancy\ndictates. They know. I am sure I don't.\n\nAnd after it all--\n\n\"Oh, dear, dear!\" said Margaret; \"I _do_ wish he didn't have such nice\neyes!\"\n\n\n\nVI\n\nOn the way to luncheon Mr. Woods came upon Ad\u00e8le Haggage and Hugh Van\nOrden, both of whom he knew, very much engrossed in one another, in a\nnook under the stairway. To Billy it seemed just now quite proper that\nevery one should be in love; wasn't it--after all--the most pleasant\ncondition in the world? So he greeted them with a semi-paternal smile\nthat caused Ad\u00e8le to flush a little.\n\nFor she was--let us say, interested--in Mr. Van Orden. That was\ntolerably well known. In fact, Margaret--prompted by Mrs. Haggage,\nit must be confessed--had invited him to Selwoode for the especial\npurpose of entertaining Miss Ad\u00e8le Haggage; for he was a good match,\nand Mrs. Haggage, as an experienced chaperon, knew the value of\ncountry houses. Very unexpectedly, however, the boy had developed a\ndisconcerting tendency to fall in love with Margaret, who snubbed him\npromptly and unmercifully. He had accordingly fallen back on Ad\u00e8le,\nand Mrs. Haggage had regained both her trust in Providence and her\ntemper.\n\nIn the breakfast-room, where luncheon was laid out, the Colonel\ngreeted Mr. Woods with the enthusiasm a sailor shipwrecked on a desert\nisland might conceivably display toward the boat-crew come to rescue\nhim. The Colonel liked Billy; and furthermore, the poor Colonel's\nposition at Selwoode just now was not utterly unlike that of the\nsuppositious mariner; were I minded to venture into metaphor, I should\npicture him as clinging desperately to the rock of an old fogeyism\nand surrounded by weltering seas of advanced thought. Colonel Hugonin\nhimself was not advanced in his ideas. Also, he had forceful opinions\nas to the ultimate destination of those who were.\n\nThen Billy was presented to the men of the party--Mr. Felix Kennaston\nand Mr. Petheridge Jukesbury. Mrs. Haggage he knew slightly; and\nKathleen Saumarez he had known very well indeed, some six years\npreviously, before she had ever heard of Miguel Saumarez, and when\nBilly was still an undergraduate. She was a widow now, and not\nwell-to-do; and Mr. Woods's first thought on seeing her was that a man\nwas a fool to write verses, and that she looked like just the sort of\nwoman to preserve them.\n\nHis second was that he had verged on imbecility when he fancied he\nadmired that slender, dark-haired type. A woman's hair ought to be an\nenormous coronal of sunlight; a woman ought to have very large, candid\neyes of a colour between that of sapphires and that of the spring\nheavens, only infinitely more beautiful than either; and all\npetticoated persons differing from this description were manifestly\nquite unworthy of any serious consideration.\n\nSo his eyes turned to Margaret, who had no eyes for him. She had\nforgotten his existence, with an utterness that verged on ostentation;\nand if it had been any one else Billy would have surmised she was in a\ntemper. But that angel in a temper!--nonsense! And, oh, what eyes she\nhad! and what lashes! and what hair!--and altogether, how adorable she\nwas, and what a wonder the admiring gods hadn't snatched her up to\nOlympus long ago!\n\nThus far Mr. Woods.\n\nBut if Miss Hugonin was somewhat taciturn, her counsellors in divers\nschemes for benefiting the universe were in opulent vein. Billy heard\nthem silently.\n\n\"I have spent the entire morning by the lake,\" Mr. Kennaston informed\nthe party at large, \"in company with a mocking-bird who was practising\na new aria. It was a wonderful place; the trees were lisping verses to\nthemselves, and the sky overhead was like a robin's egg in colour,\nand a faint wind was making tucks and ruches and pleats all over\nthe water, quite as if the breezes had set up in business as\nmantua-makers. I fancy they thought they were working on a great sheet\nof blue silk, for it was very like that. And every once in a while a\nfish would leap and leave a splurge of bubble and foam behind that you\nwould have sworn was an inserted lace medallion.\"\n\nMr. Kennaston, as you are doubtless aware, is the author of \"The\nKing's Quest\" and other volumes of verse. He is a full-bodied young\nman, with hair of no particular shade; and if his green eyes are a\nlittle aged, his manner is very youthful. His voice in speaking is\nwonderfully pleasing, and he has a habit of cocking his head on one\nside, in a bird-like fashion.\n\n\"Indeed,\" Mr. Petheridge Jukesbury observed, \"it is very true that God\nmade the country and man made the town. A little more wine, please.\"\n\nMr. Jukesbury is a prominent worker in the cause of philanthropy\nand temperance. He is ponderous and bland; and for the rest, he is\npresident of the Society for the Suppression of Nicotine and the\nNude, vice-president of the Anti-Inebriation League, secretary of the\nIncorporated Brotherhood of Benevolence, and the bearer of divers\nsimilar honours.\n\n\"I am never really happy in the country,\" Mrs. Saumarez dissented; \"it\nreminds me so constantly of our rural drama. I am always afraid the\nquartette may come on and sing something.\"\n\nKathleen Eppes Saumarez, as I hope you do not need to be told, is\nthe well-known lecturer before women's clubs, and the author of many\nsympathetic stories of Nature and animal life of the kind that have\nhad such a vogue of late. There was always an indefinable air of\npathos about her; as Hunston Wyke put it, one felt, somehow, that her\nmother had been of a domineering disposition, and that she took after\nher father.\n\n\"Ah, dear lady,\" Mr. Kennaston cried, playfully, \"you, like many of\nus, have become an alien to Nature in your quest of a mere Earthly\nParadox. Epigrams are all very well, but I fancy there is more\nhappiness to be derived from a single impulse from a vernal wood than\nfrom a whole problem-play of smart sayings. So few of us are\nnatural,\" Mr. Kennaston complained, with a dulcet sigh; \"we are too\nsophisticated. Our very speech lacks the tang of outdoor life.\nWhy should we not love Nature--the great mother, who is, I grant you,\nthe necessity of various useful inventions, in her angry moods, but\nwho, in her kindly moments--\" He paused, with a wry face. \"I beg your\npardon,\" said he, \"but I believe I've caught rheumatism lying by that\nconfounded pond.\"\n\nMrs. Saumarez rallied the poet, with a pale smile. \"That comes of\ncommuning with Nature,\" she reminded him; \"and it serves you rightly,\nfor natural communications corrupt good epigrams. I prefer Nature\nwith wide margins and uncut leaves,\" she spoke, in her best platform\nmanner. \"Art should be an expurgated edition of Nature, with all\nthe unpleasant parts left out. And I am sure,\" Mrs. Saumarez added,\nhandsomely, and clinching her argument, \"that Mr. Kennaston gives us\nmuch better sunsets in his poems than I have ever seen in the west.\"\n\nHe acknowledged this with a bow.\n\n\"Not sherry--claret, if you please,\" said Mr. Jukesbury. \"Art should\nbe an expurgated edition of Nature,\" he repeated, with a suave\nchuckle. \"Do you know, I consider that admirably put, Mrs.\nSaumarez--admirably, upon my word. Ah, if our latter-day writers would\nonly take that saying to heart! We do not need to be told of the vice\nand corruption prevalent, I am sorry to say, among the very best\npeople; what we really need is continually to be reminded of the fact\nthat pure hearts and homes and happy faces are to be found to-day\nalike in the palatial residences of the wealthy and in the humbler\nhomes of those less abundantly favoured by Fortune, and yet dwelling\ntogether in harmony and Christian resignation and--er--comparatively\nmoderate circumstances.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" Mrs. Saumarez protested, \"art has nothing to do with\nmorality. Art is a process. You see a thing in a certain way; you make\nyour reader see it in the same way--or try to. If you succeed, the\nresult is art. If you fail, it may be the book of the year.\"\n\n\"Enduring immortality and--ah--the patronage of the reading public,\"\nMr. Jukesbury placidly insisted, \"will be awarded, in the end, only\nto those who dwell upon the true, the beautiful, and the--er\n--respectable. Art must cheer; it must be optimistic and\nedifying and--ah--suitable for young persons; it must have an uplift,\na leaven of righteousness, a--er--a sort of moral baking-powder. It\nmust utterly eschew the--ah--unpleasant and repugnant details of life.\nIt is, if I may so express myself, not at home in the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\nor--er--the representation of the nude. Yes, another glass of claret,\nif you please.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said Mrs. Haggage, in her deep voice. Sarah\nEllen Haggage is, of course, the well-known author of \"Child-Labour in\nthe South,\" and \"The Down-Trodden Afro-American,\" and other notable\ncontributions to literature. She is, also, the \"Madame President\" both\nof the Society for the Betterment of Civic Government and Sewerage,\nand of the Ladies' League for the Edification of the Impecunious.\n\n\"And I am glad to see,\" Mrs. Haggage presently went on, \"that the\nliterature of the day is so largely beginning to chronicle the sayings\nand doings of the labouring classes. The virtues of the humble must be\nadmitted in spite of their dissolute and unhygienic tendencies. Yes,\"\nMrs. Haggage added, meditatively, \"our literature is undoubtedly\nacquiring a more elevated tone; at last we are shaking off the\nscintillant and unwholesome influence of the French.\"\n\n\"Ah, the French!\" sighed Mr. Kennaston; \"a people who think depravity\nthe soul of wit! Their art is mere artfulness. They care nothing for\nNature.\"\n\n\"No,\" Mrs. Haggage assented; \"they prefer nastiness. _All_ French\nbooks are immoral. I ran across one the other day that was simply\nhideously indecent--unfit for a modest woman to read. And I can assure\nyou that none of its author's other books are any better. I purchased\nthe entire set at once and read them carefully, in order to make sure\nthat I was perfectly justified in warning my working-girls' classes\nagainst them. I wish to misjudge no man--not even a member of a nation\nnotoriously devoted to absinthe and illicit relations.\"\n\nShe breathed heavily, and looked at Mr. Woods as if, somehow, he\nwas responsible. Then she gave the name of the book to Petheridge\nJukesbury. He wished to have it placed on the _Index Expurgatorius_ of\nthe Brotherhood of Benevolence, he said.\n\n\"Dear, dear,\" Felix Kennaston sighed, as Mr. Jukesbury made a note of\nit; \"you are all so practical. You perceive an evil and proceed at\nonce, in your common-sense way, to crush it, to stamp it out. Now,\nI can merely lament certain unfortunate tendencies of the age; I am\nquite unable to contend against them. Do you know,\" Mr. Kenneston\ncontinued gaily, as he trifled with a bunch of grapes, \"I feel\nhorribly out-of-place among you? Here is Mrs. Saumarez creating an\nepidemic of useful and improving knowledge throughout the country, by\nmeans of her charming lectures. Here is Mrs. Haggage, the mainspring,\nif I may say so, of any number of educational and philanthropic\nalarm clocks which will some day rouse the sleeping public from its\nlethargy. And here is my friend Jukesbury, whose eloquent pleas for a\nhigher life have turned so many workmen from gin and improvidence, and\nwhich in a printed form are disseminated even in such remote regions\nas Africa, where I am told they have produced the most satisfactory\nresults upon the unsophisticated but polygamous monarchs of that\ncontinent. And here, above all, is Miss Hugonin, utilising the vast\npower of money--which I am credibly informed is a very good thing to\nhave, though I cannot pretend to speak from experience--and casting\nwhole bakeryfuls of bread upon the waters of charity. And here am\nI, the idle singer of an empty day--a mere drone in this hive of\nphilanthropic bees! Dear, dear,\" said Mr. Kennaston, enviously, \"what\na thing it is to be practical!\" And he laughed toward Margaret, in his\nwhimsical way.\n\nMiss Hugonin had been strangely silent; but she returned Mr.\nKennaston's smile, and began to take part in the conversation.\n\n\"You're only an ignorant child,\" she rebuked him, \"and a very naughty\nchild, too, to make fun of us in this fashion.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Kennaston assented, \"I am wilfully ignorant. The world\nadores ignorance; and where ignorance is kissed it is folly to be\nwise. To-morrow I shall read you a chapter from my 'Defense of\nIgnorance,' which my confiding publisher is going to bring out in the\nautumn.\"\n\nSo the table-talk went on, and now Margaret bore a part therein.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHowever, I do not think we need record it further.\n\nMr. Woods listened in a sort of a daze. Ad\u00e8le Haggage and Hugh Van\nOrden were conversing in low tones at one end of the table; the\nColonel was eating his luncheon, silently and with a certain air of\nresignation; and so Billy Woods was left alone to attend and marvel.\n\nThe ideas they advanced seemed to him, for the most part, sensible.\nWhat puzzled him was the uniform gravity which they accorded\nequally--as it appeared to him--to the discussion of the most pompous\nplatitudes and of the most arrant nonsense. They were always serious;\nand the general tone of infallibility, Billy thought, could be\nwarranted only by a vast fund of inexperience.\n\nBut, in the main, they advocated theories he had always\nheld--excellent theories, he considered. And he was seized with an\nunreasonable desire to repudiate every one of them.\n\nFor it seemed to him that every one of them was aimed at Margaret's\napproval. It did not matter to whom a remark was ostensibly\naddressed--always at its conclusion the speaker glanced more or\nless openly toward Miss Hugonin. She was the audience to which they\nzealously played, thought Billy; and he wondered.\n\nI think I have said that, owing to the smallness of the house-party,\nluncheon was served in the breakfast-room. The dining-room at Selwoode\nis very rarely used, because Margaret declares its size makes a meal\nthere equivalent to eating out-of-doors.\n\nAnd I must confess that the breakfast-room is far cosier. The room, in\nthe first place, is of reasonable dimensions; it is hung with Flemish\ntapestries from designs by Van Eyck representing the Four Seasons, but\nthe walls and ceiling are panelled in oak, and over the mantel carved\nin bas-relief the inevitable Eagle is displayed.\n\nThe mantel stood behind Margaret's chair; and over her golden head,\nhalf-protectingly, half-threateningly, with his wings outstretched to\nthe uttermost, the Eagle brooded as he had once brooded over Frederick\nR. Woods. The old man sat contentedly beneath that symbol of what\nhe had achieved in life. He had started (as the phrase runs) from\nnothing; he had made himself a power. To him, the Eagle meant that\ncrude, incalculable power of wealth he gloried in. And to Billy Woods,\nthe Eagle meant identically the same thing, and--I am sorry to say--he\nbegan to suspect that the Eagle was really the audience to whom Miss\nHugonin's friends so zealously played.\n\nPerhaps the misanthropy of Mr. Woods was not wholly unconnected with\nthe fact that Margaret never looked at him. _She'd_ show him!--the\nfortune-hunter!\n\nSo her eyes never strayed toward him; and her attention never left\nhim. At the end of luncheon she could have enumerated for you every\nmorsel he had eaten, every glare he had directed toward Kennaston,\nevery beseeching look he had turned to her. Of course, he had taken\nsherry--dry sherry. Hadn't he told her four years ago--it was the\nfirst day she had ever worn the white organdie dotted with purple\nsprigs, and they sat by the lake so late that afternoon that Frederick\nR. Woods finally sent for them to come to dinner--hadn't he told her\nthen that only women and children cared for sweet wines? Of course he\nhad--the villain!\n\n[Illustration: \"Billy Woods\"]\n\nBilly, too, had his emotions. To hear that paragon, that queen among\nwomen, descant of work done in the slums and of the mysteries of\nsweat-shops; to hear her state off-hand that there were seventeen\nhundred and fifty thousand children between the ages of ten and\nfifteen years employed in the mines and factories of the United\nStates; to hear her discourse of foreign missions as glibly as though\nshe had been born and nurtured in Zambesi Land: all these things\nfilled him with an odd sense of alienation. He wasn't worthy of her,\nand that was a fact. He was only a dumb idiot, and half the words that\nwere falling thick and fast from philanthropic lips about him might as\nwell have been hailstones, for all the benefit he was deriving from\nthem. He couldn't understand half she said.\n\nIn consequence, he very cordially detested the people who\ncould--especially that grimacing ass, Kennaston.\n\nAltogether, neither Mr. Woods nor Miss Hugonin got much comfort from\ntheir luncheon.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nAfter luncheon Billy had a quiet half-hour with the Colonel in the\nsmoking-room.\n\nSaid Billy, between puffs of a cigar:\n\n\"Peggy's changed a bit.\"\n\nThe Colonel grunted. Perhaps he dared not trust to words.\n\n\"Seems to have made some new friends.\"\n\nA more vigorous grunt.\n\n\"Cultured lot, they seem?\" said Mr. Woods. \"Anxious to do good in the\nworld, too--philanthropic set, eh?\"\n\nA snort this time.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Mr. Woods. There was dawning suspicion in his tone.\n\nThe Colonel looked about him. \"My boy,\" said he, \"you thank your stars\nyou didn't get that money; and, depend upon it, there never was a\ngold-ship yet that wasn't followed.\"\n\n\"Pirates?\" Billy Woods suggested, helpfully.\n\n\"Pirates are human beings,\" said Colonel Hugonin, with dignity.\n\"Sharks, my boy; sharks!\"\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nThat evening, after proper deliberation, \"C\u00e9lestine,\" Miss Hugonin\ncommanded, \"get out that little yellow dress with the little red\nbandanna handkerchiefs on it; and for heaven's sake, stop pulling\nmy hair out by the roots, unless you want a _raving_ maniac on your\nhands, C\u00e9lestine!\"\n\nWhereby she had landed me in a quandary. For how, pray, is it possible\nfor me, a simple-minded male, fittingly to depict for you the clothes\nof Margaret?--the innumerable vanities, the quaint devices, the\npleasing conceits with which she delighted to enhance her comeliness?\nThe thing is beyond me. Let us keep discreetly out of her wardrobe,\nyou and I.\n\nOtherwise, I should have to prattle of an infinity of mysteries--of\nher scarfs, feathers, laces, gloves, girdles, knots, hats, shoes,\nfans, and slippers--of her embroideries, rings, pins, pendants,\nribbons, spangles, bracelets, and chains--in fine, there would be no\nend to the list of gewgaws that went to make Margaret Hugonin even\nmore adorable than Nature had fashioned her. For when you come to\nthink of it, it takes the craft and skill and life-work of a thousand\nmen to dress one girl properly; and in Margaret's case, I protest that\nevery one of them, could he have beheld the result of their united\nlabours, would have so gloried in his own part therein that there\nwould have been no putting up with any of the lot.\n\nYet when I think of the tiny shoes she affected--patent-leather ones\nmostly, with a seam running straight up the middle (and you may guess\nthe exact date of our comedy by knowing in what year these shoes were\nmodish); the string of fat pearls she so often wore about her round,\nfull throat; the white frock, say, with arabesques of blue all over\nit, that Felix Kennaston said reminded him of Ruskin's tombstone; or\nthat other white-and-blue one--_d\u00e9collet\u00e9_, that was--which I swear\nseraphic mantua-makers had woven out of mists and the skies of June:\nwhen I remember these things, I repeat, almost am I tempted to become\na boot-maker and a lapidary and a milliner and, in fine, an adept\nin all the other arts and trades and sciences that go to make a\nwell-groomed American girl what she is--the incredible fruit\nof grafted centuries, the period after the list of Time's\nachievements--just that I might describe Margaret to you properly.\n\nBut the thing is beyond me. I leave such considerations, then, to\nC\u00e9lestine, and resolve for the future rigorously to eschew all such\ngauds. Meanwhile, if an untutored masculine description will content\nyou--\n\nMargaret, I have on reliable feminine authority, was one of the very\nfew blondes whose complexions can carry off reds and yellows.\nThis particular gown--I remember it perfectly--was of a dim, dull\nyellow--flounciful (if I may coin a word), diaphanous, expansive. I\nhave not the least notion what fabric composed it; but scattered about\nit, in unexpected places, were diamond-shaped red things that I am\ncredibly informed are called medallions. The general effect of it may\nbe briefly characterised as grateful to the eye and dangerous to the\nheart, and to a rational train of thought quite fatal.\n\nFor it was cut low in the neck; and Margaret's neck and shoulders\nwould have drawn madrigals from a bench of bishops.\n\nAnd in consequence, Billy Woods ate absolutely no dinner that evening.\n\n\n\nIX\n\nIt was an hour or two later when the moon, drifting tardily up from\nthe south, found Miss Hugonin and Mr. Kennaston chatting amicably\ntogether in the court at Selwoode. They were discussing the deplorable\ntendencies of the modern drama.\n\nThe court at Selwoode lies in the angle of the building, the ground\nplan of which is L-shaped. Its two outer sides are formed by covered\ncloisters leading to the palm-garden, and by moonlight--the night\nbland and sweet with the odour of growing things, vocal with plashing\nfountains, spangled with fire-flies that flicker indolently among a\nglimmering concourse of nymphs and fauns eternally postured in flight\nor in pursuit--by moonlight, I say, the court at Selwoode is perhaps\nas satisfactory a spot for a _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ as this transitory world\naffords.\n\nMr. Kennaston was in vein to-night; he scintillated; he was also a\nlittle nervous. This was probably owing to the fact that Margaret,\nleaning against the back of the stone bench on which they both sat,\nher chin propped by her hand, was gazing at him in that peculiar,\nintent fashion of hers which--as I think I have mentioned--caused you\nfatuously to believe she had forgotten there were any other trousered\nbeings extant.\n\nMr. Kennaston, however, stuck to apt phrases and nice distinctions.\nThe moon found it edifying, but rather dull.\n\nAfter a little Mr. Kennaston paused in his boyish, ebullient speech,\nand they sat in silence. The lisping of the fountains was very\naudible. In the heavens, the moon climbed a little further and\nregistered a manifestly impossible hour on the sun-dial. It also\nbrightened.\n\nIt was a companionable sort of a moon. It invited talk of a\nconfidential nature.\n\n\"Bless my soul,\" it was signalling to any number of gentlemen at that\nmoment, \"there's only you and I and the girl here. Speak out, man!\nShe'll have you now, if she ever will. You'll never have a chance like\nthis again, I can tell you. Come, now, my dear boy, I'm shining full\nin your face, and you've no idea how becoming it is. I'm not like that\ngarish, blundering sun, who doesn't know any better than to let her\nsee how red and fidgetty you get when you're excited; I'm an old hand\nat such matters. I've presided over these little affairs since Babylon\nwas a paltry village. _I'll_ never tell. And--and if anything should\nhappen, I'm always ready to go behind a cloud, you know. So, speak\nout!--speak out, man, if you've the heart of a mouse!\"\n\nThus far the conscienceless spring moon.\n\nMr. Kennaston sighed. The moon took this as a promising sign and\nbrightened over it perceptibly, and thereby afforded him an excellent\ngambit.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Margaret. \"What is it, beautiful?\"\n\nThat, in privacy, was her fantastic name for him.\n\nThe poet laughed a little. \"Beautiful child,\" said he--and that, under\nsimilar circumstances, was his perfectly reasonable name for\nher--\"I have been discourteous. To be frank, I have been sulking as\nirrationally as a baby who clamours for the moon yonder.\"\n\n\"You aren't really anything but a baby, you know.\" Indeed, Margaret\nalmost thought of him as such. He was so delightfully na\u00eff.\n\nHe bent toward her. A faint tremor woke in his speech. \"And so,\" said\nhe, softly, \"I cry for the moon--the unattainable, exquisite moon. It\nis very ridiculous, is it not?\"\n\nBut he did not look at the moon. He looked toward Margaret--past\nMargaret, toward the gleaming windows of Selwoode, where the Eagle\nbrooded:\n\n\"Oh, I really can't say,\" Margaret cried, in haste. \"She was kind to\nEndymion, you know. We will hope for the best. I think we'd better go\ninto the house now.\"\n\n\"You bid me hope?\" said he.\n\n\"Beautiful, if you really want the moon, I don't see the _least_\nobjection to your continuing to hope. They make so many little\nairships and things nowadays, you know, and you'll probably find it\nonly green cheese, after all. What _is_ green cheese, I wonder?--it\nsounds horribly indigestible and unattractive, doesn't it?\" Miss\nHugonin babbled, in a tumult of fear and disappointment. He was about\nto spoil their friendship now; men were so utterly inconsiderate. \"I'm\na little cold,\" said she, mendaciously, \"I really must go in.\"\n\nHe detained her. \"Surely,\" he breathed, \"you must know what I have so\nlong wanted to tell you--\"\n\n\"I haven't the _least_ idea,\" she protested, promptly. \"You can tell\nme all about it in the morning. I have some accounts to cast up\nto-night. Besides, I'm not a good person to tell secrets to.\nYou--you'd much better not tell me. Oh, really, Mr. Kennaston,\" she\ncried, earnestly, \"you'd much better not tell me!\"\n\n\"Ah, Margaret, Margaret,\" he pleaded, \"I am not adamant. I am only a\nman, with a man's heart that hungers for you, cries for you, clamours\nfor you day by day! I love you, beautiful child--love you with a\npoet's love that is alien to these sordid days, with a love that is\nhalf worship. I love you as Leander loved his Hero, as Pyramus loved\nThisbe. Ah, child, child, how beautiful you are! You are fairest of\ncreated women, child--fair as those long-dead queens for whose smiles\nold cities burned and kingdoms were lightly lost. I am mad for love of\nyou! Ah, have pity upon me, Margaret, for I love you very tenderly!\"\n\nHe delivered these observations with appropriate fervour.\n\n\"Mr. Kennaston,\" said she, \"I am sorry. We got along so nicely before,\nand I was _so_ proud of your friendship. We've had such good times\ntogether, you and I, and I've liked your verses so, and I've liked\nyou--Oh, please, _please_, let's keep on being just friends!\" Margaret\nwailed, piteously.\n\n\"Friends!\" he cried, and gave a bitter laugh. \"I was never friends\nwith you, Margaret. Why, even as I read my verses to you--those\npallid, ineffectual verses that praised you timorously under varied\nnames--even then there pulsed in my veins the riotous p\u00e6an of love,\nthe great mad song of love that shamed my paltry rhymes. I cannot be\nfriends with you, child! I must have all or nothing. Bid me hope or\ngo!\"\n\nMiss Hugonin meditated for a moment and did neither.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" she presently queried, \"would you be very, very much\nshocked if I descended to slang?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said he, with an uncertain smile, \"that I could endure it.\"\n\n\"Why, then--cut it out, beautiful! Cut it out! I don't believe a word\nyou've said, in the first place; and, anyhow, it annoys me to have you\ntalk to me like that. I don't like it, and it simply makes me awfully,\nawfully tired.\"\n\nWith which characteristic speech, Miss Hugonin leaned back and sat up\nvery rigidly and smiled at him like a cherub.\n\nKennaston groaned.\n\n\"It shall be as you will,\" he assured her, with a little quaver in his\nspeech that was decidedly effective. \"And in any event, I am not sorry\nthat I have loved you, beautiful child. You have always been a power\nfor good in my life. You have gladdened me with the vision of a beauty\nthat is more than human, you have heartened me for this petty business\nof living, you have praised my verses, you have even accorded me\ncertain pecuniary assistance as to their publication--though I must\nadmit that to accept it of you was very distasteful to me. Ah!\" Felix\nKennaston cried, with a quick lift of speech, \"impractical child that\nI am, I had not thought of that! My love had caused me to forget the\ngreat barrier that stands between us.\"\n\nHe gasped and took a short turn about the court.\n\n\"Pardon me, Miss Hugonin,\" he entreated, when his emotions were under\na little better control, \"for having spoken as I did. I had forgotten.\nThink of me, if you will, as no better than the others--think of me as\na mere fortune-hunter. My presumption will be justly punished.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, it isn't that,\" she cried; \"it isn't that, is it?\nYou--you would care just as much about me if I were poor, wouldn't\nyou, beautiful? I don't want you to care for me, of course,\" Margaret\nadded, with haste. \"I want to go on being friends. Oh, that money,\nthat _nasty_ money!\" she cried, in a sudden gust of petulance. \"It\nmakes me so distrustful, and I can't help it!\"\n\nHe smiled at her wistfully. \"My dear,\" said he, \"are there no mirrors\nat Selwoode to remove your doubts?\"\n\n\"I--yes, I do believe in you,\" she said, at length. \"But I don't want\nto marry you. You see, I'm not a bit in love with you,\" Margaret\nexplained, candidly.\n\nEnsued a silence. Mr. Kennaston bowed his head.\n\n\"You bid me go?\" said he.\n\n\"No--not exactly,\" said she.\n\nHe indicated a movement toward her.\n\n\"Now, you needn't attempt to take any liberties with me,\" Miss Hugonin\nannounced, decisively, \"because if you do I'll never speak to you\nagain. You must let me go now. You--you must let me think.\"\n\nThen Felix Kennaston acted very wisely. He rose and stood aside, with\na little bow.\n\n\"I can wait, child,\" he said, sadly. \"I have already waited a long\ntime.\"\n\nMiss Hugonin escaped into the house without further delay. It was very\nflattering, of course; he had spoken beautifully, she thought, and\nnobly and poetically and considerately, and altogether there was\nabsolutely no excuse for her being in a temper. Still, she was.\n\nThe moon, however, considered the affair as arranged.\n\nFor she had been no whit more resolute in her refusal, you see, than\nbecomes any self-respecting maid. In fact, she had not refused him;\nand the experienced moon had seen the hopes of many a wooer thrive,\nchameleon-like, on answers far less encouraging than that which\nMargaret had given Felix Kennaston.\n\nMargaret was very fond of him. All women like a man who can do a\npicturesque thing without bothering to consider whether or not he be\nmaking himself ridiculous; and more than once in thinking of him she\nhad wondered if--perhaps--possibly--some day--? And always these vague\nflights of fancy had ended at this precise point--incinerated, if you\nwill grant me the simile, by the sudden flaming of her cheeks.\n\nThe thing is common enough. You may remember that Romeo was not the\nonly gentleman that Juliet noticed at her d\u00e9but: there was the young\nPetruchio; and the son and heir of old Tiberio; and I do not question\nthat she had a kind glance or so for County Paris. Beyond doubt, there\nwere many with whom my lady had danced; with whom she had laughed a\nlittle; with whom she had exchanged a few perfectly affable words and\nlooks--when of a sudden her heart speaks: \"Who's he that would not\ndance? If he be married, my grave is like to prove my marriage-bed.\"\nIn any event, Paris and Petruchio and Tiberio's young hopeful can go\nhang; Romeo has come.\n\nRomeo is seldom the first. Pray you, what was there to prevent Juliet\nfrom admiring So-and-so's dancing? or from observing that Signor\nSuch-an-one had remarkably expressive eyes? or from thinking of Tybalt\nas a dear, reckless fellow whom it was the duty of some good woman to\nrescue from perdition? If no one blames the young Montague for sending\nRosaline to the right-about--Rosaline for whom he was weeping and\nrhyming an hour before--why, pray, should not Signorina Capulet have\nhad a few previous _affaires du coeur_? Depend upon it, she had; for\nwas she not already past thirteen?\n\nIn like manner, I dare say that a deal passed between Desdemona and\nCassio that the honest Moor never knew of; and that Lucrece was\nprobably very pleasant and agreeable to Tarquin, as a well-bred\nhostess should be; and that Helen had that little affair with Theseus\nbefore she ever thought of Paris; and that if Cleopatra died for love\nof Antony it was not until she had previously lived a great while with\nC\u00e6sar.\n\nSo Felix Kennaston had his hour. Now Margaret has gone into Selwoode,\nflame-faced and quite unconscious that she is humming under her breath\nthe words of a certain inane old song:\n\n \"Oh, she sat for me a chair;\n  She has ringlets in her hair;\n  She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother\"--\n\nOnly she sang it \"father.\" And afterward, she suddenly frowned and\nstamped her foot, did Margaret.\n\n\"I _hate_ him!\" said she; but she looked very guilty.\n\n\n\nX\n\nIn the living-hall of Selwoode Miss Hugonin paused. Undeniably there\nwere the accounts of the Ladies' League for the Edification of the\nImpecunious to be put in order; her monthly report as treasurer\nwas due in a few days, and Margaret was in such matters a careful,\npainstaking body, and not wholly dependent upon her secretary; but she\nwas entirely too much out of temper to attend to that now.\n\nIt was really all Mr. Kennaston's fault, she assured a pricking\nconscience, as she went out on the terrace before Selwoode. He had\nbothered her dreadfully.\n\nThere she found Petheridge Jukesbury smoking placidly in the\neffulgence of the moonlight; and the rotund, pasty countenance he\nturned toward her was ludicrously like the moon's counterfeit in muddy\nwater. I am sorry to admit it, but Mr. Jukesbury had dined somewhat\ninjudiciously. You are not to stretch the phrase; he was merely\nprepared to accord the universe his approval, to pat Destiny upon\nthe head, and his thoughts ran clear enough, but with Aprilian\ncounter-changes of the jovial and the lachrymose.\n\n\"Ah, Miss Hugonin,\" he greeted her, with a genial smile, \"I am indeed\nfortunate. You find me deep in meditation, and also, I am sorry to\nsay, in the practise of a most pernicious habit. You do not object?\nAh, that is so like you. You are always kind, Miss Hugonin. Your\nkindness, which falls, if I may so express myself, as the gentle rain\nfrom Heaven upon all deserving charitable institutions, and daily\ncomforts the destitute with good advice and consoles the sorrowing\nwith blankets, would now induce you to tolerate an odour which I am\nsure is personally distasteful to you.\"\n\n\"But _really_ I don't mind,\" was Margaret's protest.\n\n\"I cannot permit it,\" Mr. Jukesbury insisted, and waved a pudgy hand\nin the moonlight. \"No, really, I cannot permit it. We will throw\nit away, if you please, and say no more about it,\" and his glance\nfollowed the glowing flight of his cigar-end somewhat wistfully. \"Your\nfather's cigars are such as it is seldom my privilege to encounter;\nbut, then, my personal habits are not luxurious, nor my private\nincome precisely what my childish imaginings had pictured it at this\ncomparatively advanced period of life. Ah, youth, youth!--as the poet\nadmirably says, Miss Hugonin, the thoughts of youth are long, long\nthoughts, but its visions of existence are rose-tinged and free from\ncare, and its conception of the responsibilities of manhood--such\nas taxes and the water-rate--I may safely characterise as extremely\nsketchy. But pray be seated, Miss Hugonin,\" Petheridge Jukesbury\nblandly urged.\n\nCommon courtesy forced her to comply. So Margaret seated herself on\na little red rustic bench. In the moonlight--but I think I have\nmentioned how Margaret looked in the moonlight; and above her golden\nhead the Eagle, sculptured over the door-way, stretched his wings to\nthe uttermost, half-protectingly, half-threateningly, and seemed to\nview Mr. Jukesbury with a certain air of expectation.\n\n\"A beautiful evening,\" Petheridge Jukesbury suggested, after a little\ncogitation.\n\nShe conceded that this was undeniable.\n\n\"Where Nature smiles, and only the conduct of man is vile and\naltogether what it ought not to be,\" he continued, with unction--\"ah,\nhow true that is and how consoling! It is a good thing to meditate\nupon our own vileness, Miss Hugonin--to reflect that we are but worms\nwith naturally the most vicious inclinations. It is most salutary.\nEven I am but a worm, Miss Hugonin, though the press has been pleased\nto speak most kindly of me. Even you--ah, no!\" cried Mr. Jukesbury,\nkissing his finger-tips, with gallantry; \"let us say a worm who has\nburst its cocoon and become a butterfly--a butterfly with a charming\nface and a most charitable disposition and considerable property!\"\n\nMargaret thanked him with a smile, and began to think wistfully of the\nLadies' League accounts. Still, he was a good man; and she endeavoured\nto persuade herself that she considered his goodness to atone for his\nflabbiness and his fleshiness and his interminable verbosity--which\nshe didn't.\n\nMr. Jukesbury sighed.\n\n\"A naughty world,\" said he, with pathos--\"a very naughty world, which\nreally does not deserve the honour of including you in its census\nreports. Yet I dare say it has the effrontery to put you down in the\ntax-lists; it even puts me down--me, an humble worker in the vineyard,\nwith both hands set to the plough. And if I don't pay up it sells\nme out. A very naughty world, indeed! I dare say,\" Mr. Jukesbury\nobserved, raising his eyes--not toward heaven, but toward the Eagle,\n\"that its conduct, as the poet says, creates considerable distress\namong the angels. I don't know. I am not acquainted with many angels.\nMy wife was an angel, but she is now a lifeless form. She has been for\nfive years. I erected a tomb to her at considerable personal expense,\nbut I don't begrudge it--no, I don't begrudge it, Miss Hugonin. She\nwas very hard to live with. But she was an angel, and angels are rare.\nMiss Hugonin,\" said Petheridge Jukesbury, with emphasis, \"_you_ are an\nangel.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, _dear!_\" said Margaret, to herself; \"I do wish I'd gone to\nbed directly after dinner!\"\n\nAbove them the Eagle brooded.\n\n\"Surely,\" he breathed, \"you must know what I have so long wanted to\ntell you--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Margaret, \"and I don't want to know, please. You make me\nawfully tired, and I don't care for you in the _least_. Now, you let\ngo my hand--let go at once!\"\n\nHe detained her. \"You are an angel,\" he insisted--\"an angel with a\nlarge property. I love you, Margaret! Be mine!--be my blushing bride,\nI entreat you! Your property is far too large for an angel to look\nafter. You need a man of affairs. I am a man of affairs. I am\nforty-five, and have no bad habits. My press-notices are, as a rule,\nfavourable, my eloquence is accounted considerable, and my dearest\naspiration is that you will comfort my declining years. I might add\nthat I adore you, but I think I mentioned that before. Margaret, will\nyou be my blushing bride?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Miss Hugonin emphatically. \"No, you tipsy old beast--no!\"\n\nThere was a rustle of skirts. The door slammed, and the philanthropist\nwas left alone on the terrace.\n\n\n\nXI\n\nIn the living-hall Margaret came upon Hugh Van Orden, who was\nsearching in one of the alcoves for a piece of music that Ad\u00e8le\nHaggage wanted and had misplaced.\n\nThe boy greeted her miserably.\n\n\"Miss Hugonin,\" he lamented, \"you're awfully hard on me.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Margaret, \"that you consider me discourteous to a\nguest in my own house.\" Oh, I grant you Margaret was in a temper now.\n\n\"It isn't that,\" he protested; \"but I never see you alone. And I've\nhad something to tell you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said she, coldly.\n\nHe drew near to her. \"Surely,\" he breathed, \"you must know what I have\nlong wanted to tell you--\"\n\n\"Yes, I should think I _did!_\" said Margaret, \"and if you dare tell\nme a word of it I'll never speak to you again. It's getting a little\nmonotonous. Good-night, Mr. Van Orden.\"\n\nHalf way up the stairs she paused and ran lightly back.\n\n\"Oh, Hugh, Hugh!\" she said, contritely, \"I was unpardonably rude. I'm\nsorry, dear, but it's quite impossible. You are a dear, cute little\nboy, and I love you--but not that way. So let's shake hands, Hugh, and\nbe friends! And then you can go and play with Ad\u00e8le.\" He raised her\nhand to his lips. He really was a nice boy.\n\n\"But, oh, dear!\" said Margaret, when he had gone; \"what horrid\ncreatures men are, and what a temper I'm in, and what a vexatious\nplace the world is! I wish I were a pauper! I wish I had never been\nborn! And I wish--and I wish I had those League papers fixed! I'll\ndo it to-night! I'm sure I need something tranquillising, like\nassessments and decimal places and unpaid dues, to keep me from\n_screaming_. I hate them all--all three of them--as badly as I do\n_him!_\"\n\nThereupon she blushed, for no apparent reason, and went to her own\nrooms in a frame of mind that was inexcusable, but very becoming. Her\ncheeks burned, her eyes flashed with a brighter glow that was gem-like\nand a little cruel, and her chin tilted up defiantly. Margaret had a\nresolute chin, a masculine chin. I fancy that it was only at the last\nmoment that Nature found it a thought too boyish and modified it with\na dimple--a very creditable dimple, by the way, that she must have\nbeen really proud of. That ridiculous little dint saved it, feminised\nit.\n\nAltogether, then, she swept down upon the papers of the Ladies' League\nfor the Edification of the Impecunious with very much the look of a\ndiminutive Valkyrie--a Valkyrie of unusual personal attractions, you\nunderstand--_en route_ for the battle-field and a little, a very\nlittle eager and expectant of the strife.\n\nSubsequently, \"Oh, dear, _dear!_\" said she, amid a feverish rustling\nof papers; \"the whole world is out of sorts to-night! I never _did_\nknow how much seven times eight is, and I hate everybody, and I've\nleft that list of unpaid dues in Uncle Fred's room, and I've got to go\nafter it, and I don't want to! Bother those little suitors of mine!\"\n\nMiss Hugonin rose, and went out from her own rooms, carrying a bunch\nof keys, across the hallway to the room in which Frederick R. Woods\nhad died. It was his study, you may remember. It had been little\nused since his death, but Margaret kept her less important papers\nthere--the overflow, the flotsam of her vast philanthropic and\neducational correspondence.\n\nAnd there she found Billy Woods.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nHis back was turned to the door as she entered. He was staring at a\npicture beside the mantel--a portrait of Frederick R. Woods--and his\neyes when he wheeled about were wistful.\n\nThen, on a sudden, they lighted up as if they had caught fire from\nhers, and his adoration flaunted crimson banners in his cheeks, and\nhis heart, I dare say, was a great blaze of happiness. He loved her,\nyou see; when she entered a room it really made a difference to this\nabsurd young man. He saw a great many lights, for instance, and heard\nmusic. And accordingly, he laughed now in a very contented fashion.\n\n\"I wasn't burglarising,\" said he--\"that is, not exactly. I ought to\nhave asked your permission, I suppose, before coming here, but I\ncouldn't find you, and--and it was rather important. You see,\" Mr.\nWoods continued, pointing to the great carved desk. \"I happened to\nspeak of this desk to the Colonel to-night. We--we were talking of\nUncle Fred's death, and I found out, quite by accident, that it hadn't\nbeen searched since then--that is, not thoroughly. There are secret\ndrawers, you see; one here,\" and he touched the spring that threw\nit open, \"and the other on this side. There is--there is nothing of\nimportance in them; only receipted bills and such. The other drawer is\ninside that centre compartment, which is locked. The Colonel wouldn't\ncome. He said it was all foolishness, and that he had a book he wanted\nto read. So he sent me after what he called my mare's nest. It isn't,\nyou see--no, not quite, not quite,\" Mr. Woods murmured, with an odd\nsmile, and then laughed and added, lamely: \"I--I suppose I'm the only\nperson who knew about it.\"\n\nMr. Woods's manner was a thought strange. He stammered a little in\nspeaking; he laughed unnecessarily; and Margaret could see that his\nhands trembled. Taking him all in all, you would have sworn he was\nrepressing some vital emotion. But he did not seem unhappy--no, not\nexactly unhappy. He was with Margaret, you see.\n\n\"Oh, you beauty!\" his meditations ran.\n\nHe had some excuse. In the soft, rosy twilight of the room--the study\nat Selwoode is panelled in very dark oak, and the doors and windows\nare screened with crimson hangings--her parti-coloured red-and-yellow\ngown might have been a scrap of afterglow left over from an unusually\nfine sunset. In a word, Miss Hugonin was a very quaint and colourful\nand delectable figure as she came a little further into the room. Her\neyes shone like blue stars, and her hair shone--there must be pounds\nof it, Billy thought--and her very shoulders, plump, flawless,\nineffable, shone with the glow of an errant cloud-tatter that is just\npast the track of dawn, and is therefore neither pink nor white, but\nmanages somehow to combine the best points of both colours.\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\" said Miss Hugonin. Her tone imparted a surprising degree\nof chilliness to this simple remark.\n\n\"No,\" she went on, very formally, \"this is not a private room; you owe\nme no apology for being here. Indeed, I am rather obliged to you, Mr.\nWoods, for none of us knew of these secret drawers. Here is the key to\nthe central compartment, if you will be kind enough to point out the\nother one. Dear, dear!\" Margaret concluded, languidly, \"all this is\nquite like a third-rate melodrama. I haven't the least doubt you will\ndiscover a will in there in your favour, and be reinstated as the\nlong-lost heir and all that sort of thing. How tiresome that will be\nfor me, though.\"\n\nShe was in a mood to be cruel to-night. She held out the keys to\nhim, in a disinterested fashion, and dropped them daintily into his\noutstretched palm, just as she might have given a coin to an unusually\ngrimy mendicant. But the tips of her fingers grazed his hand.\n\nThat did the mischief. Her least touch was enough to set every nerve\nin his body a-tingle. \"Peggy!\" he said hoarsely, as the keys jangled\nto the floor. Then Mr. Woods drew a little nearer to her and said\n\"Peggy, Peggy!\" in a voice that trembled curiously, and appeared to\nhave no intention of saying anything further.\n\nIndeed, words would have seemed mere tautology to any one who could\nhave seen his eyes. Margaret looked into them for a minute, and her\nown eyes fell before their blaze, and her heart--very foolishly--stood\nstill for a breathing-space. Subsequently she recalled the fact\nthat he was a fortune-hunter, and that she despised him, and also\nobserved--to her surprise and indignation--that he was holding her\nhand and had apparently been doing so for some time. You may believe\nit, that she withdrew that pink-and-white trifle angrily enough.\n\n\"Pray don't be absurd, Mr. Woods,\" said she.\n\nBilly caught up the word. \"Absurd!\" he echoed--\"yes, that describes\nwhat I've been pretty well, doesn't it, Peggy? I _was_ absurd when I\nlet you send me to the right-about four years ago. I realised that\nto-day the moment I saw you. I should have held on like the very\ngrimmest death; I should have bullied you into marrying me, if\nnecessary, and in spite of fifty Anstruthers. Oh, yes, I know that\nnow. But I was only a boy then, Peggy, and so I let a boy's pride come\nbetween us. I know now there isn't any question of pride where you\nare concerned--not any question of pride nor of any silly\nmisunderstandings, nor of any uncle's wishes, nor of anything but just\nyou, Peggy. It's just you that I care for now--just you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Margaret cried, with a swift intake of the breath that was\nalmost a sob. He had dared, after all; oh, it was shameless, sordid!\nAnd yet (she thought dimly), how dear that little quiver in his voice\nhad been were it unplanned!--and how she could have loved this big,\neager boy were he not the hypocrite she knew him!\n\n_She'd_ show him! But somehow--though it was manifestly what he\ndeserved--she found she couldn't look him in the face while she did\nit.\n\nSo she dropped her eyes to the floor and waited for a moment of tense\nsilence. Then, \"Am I to consider this a proposal, Mr. Woods?\" she\nasked, in muffled tones.\n\nBilly stared. \"Yes,\" said he, very gravely, after an interval.\n\n\"You see,\" she explained, still in the same dull voice, \"you phrased\nit so vaguely I couldn't well be certain. You don't propose very well,\nMr. Woods. I--I've had opportunities to become an authority on such\nmatters, you see, since I've been rich. That makes a difference,\ndoesn't it? A great many men are willing to marry me now who wouldn't\nhave thought of such a thing, say--say, four years ago. So I've had\nsome experience. Oh, yes, three--three _persons_ have offered to marry\nme for my money earlier in this very evening--before you did, Mr.\nWoods. And, really, I can't compliment you on your methods, Mr. Woods;\nthey are a little vague, a little abrupt, a little transparent, don't\nyou think?\"\n\n\"Peggy!\" he cried, in a frightened whisper. He could not believe, you\nsee, that it was the woman he loved who was speaking.\n\nAnd for my part, I admit frankly that at this very point, if ever in\nher life, Margaret deserved a thorough shaking.\n\n\"Dear me,\" she airily observed, \"I'm sure I've said nothing out of the\nway. I think it speaks very well for you that you're so fond of your\nold home--so anxious to regain it at _any_ cost. It's quite touching,\nMr. Woods.\"\n\nShe raised her eyes toward his. I dare say she was suffering as much\nas he. But women consider it a point of honour to smile when they\nstab; Margaret smiled with an innocence that would have seemed\noverdone in an angel.\n\nThen, in an instant, she had the grace to be abjectly ashamed of\nherself. Billy's face had gone white. His mouth was set, mask-like,\nand his breathing was a little perfunctory. It stung her, though, that\nhe was not angry. He was sorry.\n\n\"I--I see,\" he said, very carefully. \"You think I--want the money.\nYes--I see.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" she queried, pleasantly. \"Dear me, money's a very\nsensible thing to want, I'm sure. It makes a great difference, you\nknow.\"\n\nHe looked down into her face for a moment. One might have sworn this\ndetected fortune-hunter pitied her.\n\n\"Yes,\" he assented, slowly, \"it makes a difference--not a difference\nfor the better, I'm afraid, Peggy.\"\n\nEnsued a silence.\n\nThen Margaret tossed her head. She was fast losing her composure.\nShe would have given the world to retract what she had said, and\naccordingly she resolved to brazen it out.\n\n\"You needn't look at me as if I were a convicted criminal,\" she said,\nsharply. \"I won't marry you, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n\"It isn't that I'm thinking of,\" said Mr. Woods, with a grave smile.\n\"You see, it takes me a little time to realise your honest opinion\nof me. I believe I understand now. You think me a very hopeless\ncad--that's about your real opinion, isn't it, Peggy? I didn't know\nthat, you see. I thought you knew me better than that. You did once,\nPeggy--once, a long time ago, and--and I hoped you hadn't quite\nforgotten that time.\"\n\nThe allusion was ill chosen.\n\n\"Oh, oh, _oh!_\" she cried, gasping. \"_You_ to remind me of that\ntime!--you of all men. Haven't you a vestige of shame? Haven't you\na rag of honour left? Oh, I didn't know there were such men in the\nworld! And to think--to think--\" Margaret's glorious voice broke, and\nshe wrung her hands helplessly.\n\nThen, after a little, she raised her eyes to his, and spoke without\na trace of emotion. \"To think,\" she said, and her voice was toneless\nnow, \"to think that I loved you! It's that that hurts, you know. For I\nloved you very dearly, Billy Woods--yes, I think I loved you quite as\nmuch as any woman can ever love a man. You were the first, you see,\nand girls--girls are very foolish about such things. I thought you\nwere brave, and strong, and clean, and honest, and beautiful, and\ndear--oh, quite the best and dearest man in the world, I thought you,\nBilly Woods! That--that was queer, wasn't it?\" she asked, with a\nlistless little shiver. \"Yes, it was very queer. You didn't think of\nme in quite that way, did you? No, you--you thought I was well enough\nto amuse you for a while. I was well enough for a summer flirtation,\nwasn't I, Billy? But marriage--ah, no, you never thought of marriage\nthen. You ran away when Uncle Fred suggested that. You refused\npoint-blank--refused in this very room--didn't you, Billy? Ah,\nthat--that hurt,\" Margaret ended, with a faint smile. \"Yes, it--hurt.\"\n\nBilly Woods raised a protesting hand, as though to speak, but\nafterward he drew a deep, tremulous breath and bit his lip and was\nsilent.\n\nShe had spoken very quietly, very simply, very like a tired child;\nnow her voice lifted. \"But you've hurt me more to-night,\" she said,\nequably--\"to-night, when you've come cringing back to me--to me, whom\nyou'd have none of when I was poor. I'm rich now, though. That makes\na difference, doesn't it, Billy? You're willing to whistle back the\ngirl's love you flung away once--yes, quite willing. But can't you\nunderstand how much it must hurt me to think I ever loved you?\"\nMargaret asked, very gently.\n\nShe wanted him to understand. She wanted him to be ashamed. She prayed\nGod that he might be just a little, little bit ashamed, so that she\nmight be able to forgive him.\n\nBut he stood silent, bending puzzled brows toward her.\n\n\"Can't you understand, Billy?\" she pleaded, softly. \"I can't help\nseeing what a cur you are. I must hate you, Billy--of course, I must,\"\nshe insisted, very gently, as though arguing the matter with herself;\nthen suddenly she sobbed and wrung her hands in anguish. \"Oh, I can't,\nI can't!\" she wailed. \"God help me, I can't hate you, even though I\nknow you for what you are!\"\n\nHis arms lifted a little; and in a flash Margaret knew that what she\nmost wanted in all the world was to have them close about her, and\nthen to lay her head upon his shoulder and cry contentedly.\n\nOh, she did want to forgive him! If he had lost all sense of shame,\nwhy could he not lie to her? Surely, he could at least lie? And,\noh, how gladly she would believe!--only the tiniest, the flimsiest\nfiction, her eyes craved of him.\n\nBut he merely said \"I see--I see,\" very slowly, and then smiled.\n\"We'll put the money aside just now,\" he said. \"Perhaps, after a\nlittle, we--we'll came back to that. I think you've forgotten, though,\nthat when--when Uncle Fred and I had our difference you had just\nthrown me over--had just ordered me never to speak to you again?\nI couldn't very well ask you to marry me, could I, under those\ncircumstances?\"\n\n\"I spoke in a moment of irritation,\" a very dignified Margaret pointed\nout; \"you would have paid no attention whatever to it if you had\nreally--cared.\"\n\nBilly laughed, rather sadly. \"Oh, I cared right enough,\" he said. \"I\nstill care. The question is--do you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Margaret, with decision, \"I don't--not in the _least_.\"\n\n\"Peggy,\" Mr. Woods commanded, \"look at me!\"\n\n\"You have had your answer, I think,\" Miss Hugonin indifferently\nobserved.\n\nBilly caught her chin in his hand and turned her face to his. \"Peggy,\ndo you--care?\" he asked, softly.\n\nAnd Margaret looked into his honest-seeming eyes and, in a panic, knew\nthat her traitor lips were forming \"yes.\"\n\n\"That would be rather unfortunate, wouldn't it?\" she asked, with a\nsmile. \"You see, it was only an hour ago I promised to marry Mr.\nKennaston.\"\n\n\"Kennaston!\" Billy gasped. \"You--you don't mean that you care for\n_him_, Peggy?\"\n\n\"I really can't see why it should concern you,\" said Margaret,\nsweetly, \"but since you ask--I do. You couldn't expect me to remain\ninconsolable forever, you know.\"\n\nThen the room blurred before her eyes. She stood rigid, defiant.\nShe was dimly aware that Billy was speaking, speaking from a great\ndistance, it seemed, and then after a century or two his face came\nback to her out of the whirl of things. And, though she did not know\nit, they were smiling bravely at one another.\n\n\"--and so,\" Mr. Woods was stating, \"I've been an even greater ass than\nusual, and I hope you'll be very, very happy.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Billy unfolded it slowly, with a puzzled look growing\nin his countenance.\"]\n\n\"Thank you,\" she returned, mechanically, \"I--I hope so.\"\n\nAfter an interval, \"Good-night, Peggy,\" said Mr. Woods.\n\n\"Oh--? Good-night,\" said she, with a start.\n\nHe turned to go. Then, \"By Jove!\" said he, grimly, \"I've been so busy\nmaking an ass of myself I'd forgotten all about more--more important\nthings.\"\n\nMr. Woods picked up the keys and, going to the desk, unlocked the\ncentre compartment with a jerk. Afterward he gave a sharp exclamation.\nHe had found a paper in the secret drawer at the back which appeared\nto startle him.\n\nBilly unfolded it slowly, with a puzzled look growing in his\ncountenance. Then for a moment Margaret's golden head drew close to\nhis yellow curls and they read it through together. And in the most\nmelodramatic and improbable fashion in the world they found it to be\nthe last will and testament of Frederick R. Woods.\n\n\"But--but I don't understand,\" was Miss Hugonin's awed comment. \"It's\nexactly like the other will, only--why, it's dated the seventeenth\nof June, the day before he died! And it's witnessed by Hodges and\nBurton--the butler and the first footman, you know--and they've never\nsaid anything about such a paper. And, then, why should he have made\nanother will just like the first?\"\n\nBilly pondered.\n\nBy and bye, \"I think I can explain that,\" he said, in a rather\npeculiar voice. \"You see, Hodges and Burton witnessed all his papers,\nhalf the time without knowing what they were about. They would hardly\nhave thought of this particular one after his death. And it isn't\nquite the same will as the other; it leaves you practically\neverything, but it doesn't appoint any trustees, as the other did,\nbecause this will was drawn up after you were of age. Moreover, it\ncontains these four bequests to colleges, to establish a Woods chair\nof ethnology, which the other will didn't provide for. Of course, it\nwould have been simpler merely to add a codicil to the first will,\nbut Uncle Fred was always very methodical. I--I think he was probably\ngoing through the desk the night he died, destroying various papers.\nHe must have taken the other will out to destroy it just--just before\nhe died. Perhaps--perhaps--\" Billy paused for a little and then\nlaughed, unmirthfully. \"It scarcely matters,\" said he. \"Here is the\nwill. It is undoubtedly genuine and undoubtedly the last he made.\nYou'll have to have it probated, Peggy, and settle with the colleges.\nIt--it won't make much of a hole in the Woods millions.\"\n\nThere was a half-humorous bitterness in his voice that Margaret noted\nsilently. So (she thought) he had hoped for a moment that at the last\nFrederick R. Woods had relented toward him. It grieved her, in a dull\nfashion, to see him so mercenary. It grieved her--though she would\nhave denied it emphatically--to see him so disappointed. Since he\nwanted the money so much, she would have liked for him to have had it,\nworthless as he was, for the sake of the boy he had been.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, coldly, as she took the paper; \"I will give it\nto my father. He will do what is necessary. Good-night, Mr. Woods.\"\n\nThen she locked up the desk in a businesslike fashion and turned to\nhim, and held out her hand.\n\n\"Good-night, Billy,\" said this perfectly inconsistent young woman.\n\"For a moment I thought Uncle Fred had altered his will in your\nfavour. I almost wish he had.\"\n\nBilly smiled a little.\n\n\"That would never have done,\" he said, gravely, as he shook\nhands; \"you forget what a sordid, and heartless, and generally\ngood-for-nothing chap I am, Peggy. It's much better as it is.\"\n\nOnly the tiniest, the flimsiest fiction, her eyes craved of him. Even\nnow, at the eleventh hour, lie to me, Billy Woods, and, oh, how gladly\nI will believe!\n\nBut he merely said \"Good-night, Peggy,\" and went out of the room. His\nbroad shoulders had a pathetic droop, a listlessness.\n\nMargaret was glad. Of course, she was glad. At last, she had told him\nexactly what she thought of him. Why shouldn't she be glad? She was\ndelighted.\n\nSo, by way of expressing this delight, she sat down at the desk and\nbegan to cry very softly.\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nHaving duly considered the emptiness of existence, the unworthiness of\nmen, the dreary future that awaited her--though this did not trouble\nher greatly, as she confidently expected to die soon--and many other\nsuch dolorous topics, Miss Hugonin decided to retire for the night.\nShe rose, filled with speculations as to the paltriness of life and\nthe probability of her eyes being red in the morning.\n\n\"It will be all his fault if they are,\" she consoled herself.\n\"Doubtless he'll be very much pleased. After robbing me of all faith\nin humanity, I dare say the one thing needed to complete his happiness\nis to make me look like a fright. I hate him! After making me\nmiserable, now, I suppose he'll go off and make some other woman\nmiserable. Oh, of course, he'll make love to the first woman he meets\nwho has any money. I'm sure she's welcome to him. I only pity any\nwoman who has to put up with _him_. No, I don't,\" Margaret decided,\nafter reflection; \"I hate her, too!\"\n\nMiss Hugonin went to the door leading to the hallway and paused.\nThen--I grieve to relate it--she shook a little pink-tipped fist in\nthe air.\n\n\"I detest you!\" she commented, between her teeth; \"oh, how _dare_ you\nmake me feel so ashamed of the way I've treated you!\"\n\nThe query--as possibly you may have divined--was addressed to Mr.\nWoods. He was standing by the fireplace in the hallway, and his tall\nfigure was outlined sharply against the flame of the gas-logs that\nburned there. His shoulders had a pathetic droop, a listlessness.\n\nBilly was reading a paper of some kind by the firelight, and the black\noutline of his face smiled grimly over it. Then he laughed and threw\nit into the fire.\n\n\"Billy!\" a voice observed--a voice that was honey and gold and velvet\nand all that is most sweet and rich and soft in the world.\n\nMr. Woods was aware of a light step, a swishing, sibilant, delightful\nrustling--the caress of sound is the rustling of a well-groomed\nwoman's skirts--and of an afterthought of violets, of a mere\nreminiscence of orris, all of which came toward him through the\ndimness of the hall. He started, noticeably.\n\n\"Billy,\" Miss Hugonin stated, \"I'm sorry for what I said to you. I'm\nnot sure it isn't true, you know, but I'm sorry I said it.\"\n\n\"Bless your heart!\" said Billy; \"don't you worry over that, Peggy.\nThat's all right. Incidentally, the things you've said to me and about\nme aren't true, of course, but we won't discuss that just now. I--I\nfancy we're both feeling a bit fagged. Go to bed, Peggy! We'll both\ngo to bed, and the night will bring counsel, and we'll sleep off all\nunkindliness. Go to bed, little sister!--get all the beauty-sleep you\naren't in the least in need of, and dream of how happy you're going to\nbe with the man you love. And--and in the morning I may have something\nto say to you. Good-night, dear.\"\n\nAnd this time he really went. And when he had come to the bend in the\nstairs his eyes turned back to hers, slowly and irresistibly, drawn\ntoward them, as it seemed, just as the sunflower is drawn toward the\nsun, or the needle toward the pole, or, in fine, as the eyes of young\ngentlemen ordinarily are drawn toward the eyes of the one woman in the\nworld. Then he disappeared.\n\nThe mummery of it vexed Margaret. There was no excuse for his looking\nat her in that way. It irritated her. She was almost as angry with him\nfor doing it as she would have been for not doing it.\n\nTherefore, she bent an angry face toward the fire, her mouth pouting\nin a rather inviting fashion. Then it rounded slowly into a sanguine\nO, which of itself suggested osculation, but in reality stood for\n\"observe!\" For the paper Billy had thrown into the fire had fallen\nunder the gas-logs, and she remembered his guilty start.\n\n\"After all,\" said Margaret, \"it's none of my business.\"\n\nSo she eyed it wistfully.\n\n\"It may be important,\" she considerately remembered. \"It ought not to\nbe left there.\"\n\nSo she fished it out with a big paper-cutter.\n\n\"But it can't be very important,\" she dissented afterward, \"or he\nwouldn't have thrown it away.\"\n\nSo she looked at the superscripture on the back of it.\n\nThen she gave a little gasp and tore it open and read it by the\nfirelight.\n\nMiss Hugonin subsequently took credit to herself for not going into\nhysterics. And I think she had some reason to; for she found the paper\na duplicate of the one Billy had taken out of the secret drawer, with\nhis name set in the place of hers. At the last Frederick R. Woods had\nrelented toward his nephew.\n\nMargaret laughed a little; then she cried a little; then she did both\ntogether. Afterward she sat in the firelight, very puzzled and very\nexcited and very penitent and very beautiful, and was happier than she\nhad ever been in her life.\n\n\"He had it in his pocket,\" her dear voice quavered; \"he had it in his\npocket, my brave, strong, beautiful Billy did, when he asked me to\nmarry him. It was King Cophetua wooing the beggar-maid--and the beggar\nwas an impudent, ungrateful, idiotic little _piece!_\" Margaret hissed,\nin her most shrewish manner. \"She ought to be spanked. She ought to go\ndown on her knees to him in sackcloth, and tears, and ashes, and all\nsorts of penitential things. She will, too. Oh, it's such a beautiful\nworld--_such_ a beautiful world! Billy loves me--really! Billy's a\nmillionaire, and I'm a pauper. Oh, I'm glad, glad, _glad!_\"\n\nShe caressed the paper that had rendered the world such a goodly place\nto live in--caressed it tenderly and rubbed her check against it. That\nwas Margaret's way of showing affection, you know; and I protest it\nmust have been very pleasant for the paper. The only wonder was that\nthe ink it was written in didn't turn red with delight.\n\nThen she read it through again, for sheer enjoyment of those\nbeautiful, incomprehensible words that disinherited her. How _lovely_\nof Uncle Fred! she thought. Of course, he'd forgiven Billy; who\nwouldn't? What beautiful language Uncle Fred used! quite prayer-booky,\nshe termed it. Then she gasped.\n\nThe will in Billy's favour was dated a week earlier than the one they\nhad found in the secret drawer. It was worthless, mere waste paper. At\nthe last Frederick R. Woods's pride had conquered his love.\n\n\"Oh, the horrid old man!\" Margaret wailed; \"he's left me everything he\nhad! How _dare_ he disinherit Billy! I call it rank impertinence in\nhim. Oh, boy dear, dear, _dear_ boy!\" Miss Hugonin crooned, in an\necstacy of tenderness and woe. \"He found this first will in one of the\nother drawers, and thought _he_ was the rich one, and came in a great\nwhirl of joy to ask me to marry him, and I was horrid to him! Oh, what\na mess I've made of it! I've called him a fortune-hunter, and I've\ntold him I love another man, and he'll never, never ask me to marry\nhim now. And I love him, I worship him, I adore him! And if only\nI were poor--\"\n\nEnsued a silence. Margaret lifted the two wills, scrutinised them\nclosely, and then looked at the fire, interrogatively.\n\n\"It's penal servitude for quite a number of years,\" she said. \"But,\nthen, he really _couldn't_ tell any one, you know. No gentleman would\nallow a lady to be locked up in jail. And if he knew--if he knew I\ndidn't and couldn't consider him a fortune-hunter, I really believe he\nwould--\"\n\nWhatever she believed he would do, the probability of his doing it\nseemed highly agreeable to Miss Hugonin. She smiled at the fire in the\nmost friendly fashion, and held out one of the folded papers to it.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Margaret, \"I'm quite sure he will.\"\n\nThere I think we may leave her. For I have dredged the dictionary,\nand I confess I have found no fitting words wherewith to picture this\ninconsistent, impulsive, adorable young woman, dreaming brave dreams\nin the firelight of her lover and of their united future. I should\nonly bungle it. You must imagine it for yourself.\n\nIt is a pretty picture, is it not?--with its laughable side, perhaps;\nunder the circumstances, whimsical, if you will; but very, very\nsacred. For she loved him with a clean heart, loved him infinitely.\n\nLet us smile at it--tenderly--and pass on.\n\nBut upon my word, when I think of how unreasonably, how outrageously\nMargaret had behaved during the entire evening, I am tempted to\ndepose her as our heroine. I begin to regret I had not selected Ad\u00e8le\nHaggage.\n\nShe would have done admirably. For, depend upon it, she, too, had\nher trepidations, her white nights, her occult battles over Hugh Van\nOrden. Also, she was a pretty girl--if you care for brunettes--and\naccomplished. She was versed in I forget how many foreign languages,\nboth Continental and dead, and could discourse sensibly in any one of\nthem. She was perfectly reasonable, perfectly consistent, perfectly\nunimpulsive, and never expressed an opinion that was not countenanced\nby at least two competent authorities. I don't know a man living,\nprepared to dispute that Miss Haggage excelled Miss Hugonin in all\nthese desirable qualities.\n\nYet with pleasing unanimity they went mad for Margaret and had the\ngreatest possible respect for Ad\u00e8le.\n\nAnd, my dear Mrs. Grundy, I grant you cheerfully that this was all\nwrong. A sensible man, as you very justly observe, will seek in a\nwoman something more enduring than mere personal attractions; he will\nvalue her for some sensible reason--say, for her wit, or her learning,\nor her skill in cookery, or her proficiency in Greek. A sensible man\nwill look for a sensible woman; he will not concern his sensible head\nover such trumperies as a pair of bright eyes, or a red lip or so, or\na satisfactory suit of hair. These are fleeting vanities.\n\nHowever--\n\nYou have doubtless heard ere this, my dear madam, that had Cleopatra's\nnose been an inch shorter the destiny of the world would have been\nchanged; had she been the woman you describe--perfectly reasonable,\nperfectly consistent, perfectly sensible in all she said and\ndid--confess, dear lady, wouldn't Antony have taken to his heels and\nhave fled from such a monster?\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nI regret to admit that Mr. Woods did not toss feverishly about his bed\nall through the silent watches of the night. He was very miserable,\nbut he was also twenty-six. That is an age when the blind bow-god\ndeals no fatal wounds. It is an age to suffer poignantly, if you will;\nan age wherein to aspire to the dearest woman on earth, to write her\nhalting verses, to lose her, to affect the _clich\u00e9s_ of cynicism, to\nhear the chimes at midnight--and after it all, to sleep like a top.\n\nSo Billy slept. And kind Hypnos loosed a dream through the gates of\nivory that lifted him to a delectable land where Peggy was nineteen,\nand had never heard of Kennaston, and was unbelievably sweet and dear\nand beautiful. But presently they and the Colonel put forth to sea--on\na great carved writing-desk--fishing for sharks, which the Colonel\nsaid were very plentiful in those waters; and Frederick R. Woods\nclimbed up out of the sea, and said Billy was a fool and must go to\ncollege; and Peggy said that was impossible, as seventeen hundred and\nfifty thousand children had to be given an education apiece, and they\ncouldn't spare one for Billy; and a missionary from Zambesi Land came\nout of one of the secret drawers and said Billy must give him both\nof his feet as he needed them for his working-girls' classes; and\nthereupon the sharks poked their heads out of the water and began, in\na deafening chorus, to cry, \"Feet, feet, feet!\" And Billy then woke\nwith a start, and found it was only the birds chattering in the dawn\noutside.\n\nThen he was miserable.\n\nHe tossed, and groaned, and dozed, and smoked cigarettes until he\ncould stand it no longer. He got up and dressed, in sheer desperation,\nand went for a walk in the gardens.\n\nThe day was clear as a new-minted coin. It was not yet wholly aired,\nnot wholly free from the damp savour of night, but low in the east the\nsun was taking heart. A mile-long shadow footed it with Billy Woods\nin his pacings through the amber-chequered gardens. Actaeon-like, he\nsurprised the world at its toilet, and its fleeting grace somewhat\nfortified his spirits.\n\nBut his thoughts pestered him like gnats. The things he said to the\nroses it is not necessary to set down.\n\n\n\nXV\n\nAfter a vituperative half-hour or so Mr. Woods was hungry. He came\nback toward Selwoode; and upon the terrace in front of the house he\nfound Kathleen Saumarez.\n\nDuring the warm weather, one corner of the terrace had been converted,\nby means of gay red-and-white awnings, into a sort of living-room.\nThere were chairs, tables, sofa-cushions, bowls of roses, and any\nnumber of bright-coloured rugs. Altogether, it was a cosy place,\nand the glowing hues of its furnishings were very becoming to Mrs.\nSaumarez, who sat there writing industriously.\n\nIt was a thought embarrassing. They had avoided one another\nyesterday--rather obviously--both striving to put off a necessarily\nawkward meeting. Now it had come. And now, somehow, their eyes met for\na moment, and they laughed frankly, and the awkwardness was gone.\n\n\"Kathleen,\" said Mr. Woods, with conviction, \"you're a dear.\"\n\n\"You broke my heart,\" said she, demurely, \"but I'm going to forgive\nyou.\"\n\nMrs. Saumarez was not striving to be clever now. And, heavens (thought\nBilly), how much nicer she was like this! It wasn't the same woman:\nher thin cheeks flushed arbutus-like, and her rather metallic voice\nwas grown low and gentle. Billy brought memories with him, you see;\nand for the moment, she was Kathleen Eppes again--Kathleen Eppes in\nthe first flush of youth, eager, trustful, and joyous-hearted, as he\nhad known her long ago. Since then, the poor woman had eaten of the\nbread of dependence and had found it salt enough; she had paid for it\ndaily, enduring a thousand petty slights, a thousand petty insults,\nand smiling under them as only women can. But she had forgotten now\nthat shrewd Kathleen Saumarez who must earn her livelihood as best she\nmight. She smiled frankly--a purely unprofessional smile.\n\n\"I was sorry when I heard you were coming,\" she said, irrelevantly,\n\"but I'm glad now.\"\n\nMr. Woods--I grieve to relate--was still holding her hand in his.\nThere stirred in his pulses the thrill Kathleen Eppes had always\nwakened--a thrill of memory now, a mere wraith of emotion. He was\nthinking of a certain pink-cheeked girl with crinkly black-brown\nhair and eyes that he had likened to chrysoberyls--and he wondered\nwhimsically what had become of her. This was not she. This was\nassuredly not Kathleen, for this woman had a large mouth--a humorous\nand kindly mouth it was true, but undeniably a large one--whereas,\nKathleen's mouth had been quite perfect and rather diminutive than\notherwise. Hadn't he rhymed of it often enough to know?\n\nThey stood gazing at one another for a long time; and in the back of\nBilly's brain lines of his old verses sang themselves to a sad little\ntune--the verses that reproved the idiocy of all other poets, who had\nvery foolishly written their sonnets to other women: and yet, as the\njingle pointed out,\n\n  Had these poets ever strayed\n  In thy path, they had not made\n  Random rhymes of Arabella,\n  Songs of Dolly, hymns of Stella,\n  Lays of Lalage or Chloris--\n  Not of Daphne nor of Doris,\n  Florimel nor Amaryllis,\n  Nor of Phyllida nor Phyllis,\n  Were their wanton melodies:\n  But all of these--\n  All their melodies had been\n  Of thee, Kathleen.\n\nWould they have been? Billy thought it improbable. The verses were\nvery silly; and, recalling the big, blundering boy who had written\nthem, Billy began to wonder--somewhat forlornly--whither he, too,\nhad vanished. He and the girl he had gone mad for both seemed rather\nmythical--legendary as King Pepin.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Saumarez--and oh, she startled him; \"I fancy they're\nboth quite dead by now. Billy,\" she cried, earnestly, \"don't laugh\nat them!--don't laugh at those dear, foolish children! I--somehow, I\ncouldn't bear that, Billy.\"\n\n\"Kathleen,\" said Mr. Woods, in admiration, \"you're a witch. I wasn't\nlaughing, though, my dear. I was developing quite a twilight mood over\nthem--a plaintive, old-lettery sort of mood, you know.\"\n\nShe sighed a little. \"Yes--I know.\" Then her eyelids flickered in a\nparody of Kathleen's glance that Billy noted with a queer tenderness.\n\"Come and talk to me, Billy,\" she commanded. \"I'm an early bird this\nmorning, and entitled to the very biggest and best-looking worm I can\nfind. You're only a worm, you know--we're all worms. Mr. Jukesbury\ntold me so last night, making an exception in my favour, for it\nappears I'm an angel. He was amorously inclined last night, the tipsy\nold fraud! It's shameless, Billy, the amount of money he gets out of\nMiss Hugonin--for the deserving poor. Do you know, I rather fancy he\nclasses himself under that head? And I grant you he's poor enough--but\ndeserving!\" Mrs. Saumarez snapped her fingers eloquently.\n\n\"Eh? Shark, eh?\" queried Mr. Woods, in some discomfort.\n\nShe nodded. \"He is as bad as Sarah Haggage,\" she informed him, \"and\neverybody knows what a bloodsucker she is. The Haggage is a disease,\nBilly, that all rich women are exposed to--'more easily caught than\nthe pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad.' Depend upon it,\nBilly, those two will have every penny they can get out of your\nuncle's money.\"\n\n\"Peggy's so generous,\" he pleaded. \"She wants to make everybody\nhappy--bring about a general millenium, you know.\"\n\n\"She pays dearly enough for her fancies,\" said Mrs. Saumarez, in a\nhard voice. Then, after a little, she cried, suddenly: \"Oh, Billy,\nBilly, it shames me to think of how we lie to her, and toady to her,\nand lead her on from one mad scheme to another!--all for the sake of\nthe money we can pilfer incidentally! We're all arrant hypocrites, you\nknow; I'm no better than the others, Billy--not a bit better. But\nmy husband left me so poor, and I had always been accustomed to the\npretty things of life, and I couldn't--I couldn't give them up, Billy.\nI love them too dearly. So I lie, and toady, and write drivelling\ntalks about things I don't understand, for drivelling women to\nlisten to, and I still have the creature comforts of life. I pawn my\nself-respect for them--that's all. Such a little price to pay, isn't\nit, Billy?\"\n\nShe spoke in a sort of frenzy. I dare say that at the outset she\nwanted Mr. Woods to know the worst of her, knowing he could not fail\nto discover it in time. Billy brought memories with him, you see; and\nthis shrewd, hard woman wanted, somehow, more than anything else in\nthe world, that he should think well of her. So she babbled out the\nwhole pitiful story, waiting in a kind of terror to see contempt and\ndisgust awaken in his eyes.\n\nBut he merely said \"I see--I see,\" very slowly, and his eyes were\nkindly. He couldn't be angry with her, somehow; that pink-cheeked,\ncrinkly haired girl stood between them and shielded her. He was only\nvery, very sorry.\n\n\"And Kennaston?\" he asked, after a little.\n\nMrs. Saumarez flushed. \"Mr. Kennaston is a man of great genius,\" she\nsaid, quickly. \"Of course, Miss Hugonin is glad to assist him in\npublishing his books--it's an honour to her that he permits it. They\nhave to be published privately, you know, as the general public isn't\ncapable of appreciating such dainty little masterpieces. Oh, don't\nmake any mistake, Billy--Mr. Kennaston is a very wonderful and very\nadmirable man.\"\n\n\"H'm, yes; he struck me as being an unusually nice chap,\" said Mr.\nWoods, untruthfully. \"I dare say they'll be very happy.\"\n\n\"Who?\" Mrs. Saumarez demanded.\n\n\"Why--er--I don't suppose they'll make any secret of it,\" Billy\nstammered, in tardy repentance of his hasty speaking. \"Peggy told me\nlast night she had accepted him.\"\n\nMrs. Saumarez turned to rearrange a bowl of roses. She seemed to have\nsome difficulty over it.\n\n\"Billy,\" she spoke, inconsequently, and with averted head, \"an honest\nman is the noblest work of God--and the rarest.\"\n\nBilly groaned.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said he, \"I've just been telling the roses in the\ngardens yonder the same thing about women? I'm a misogynist this\nmorning. I've decided no woman is worthy of being loved.\"\n\n\"That is quite true,\" she assented, \"but, on the other hand, no man is\nworthy of loving.\"\n\nBilly smiled.\n\n\"I've likewise come to the conclusion,\" said he, \"that a man's love is\nlike his hat, in that any peg will do to hang it on; also, in that the\nproper and best place for it is on his own head. Oh, I assure you,\nI vented any number of cheap cynicisms on the helpless roses! And\nyet--will you believe it, Kathleen?--it doesn't seem to make me feel a\nbit better--no, not a bit.\"\n\n\"It's very like his hat,\" she declared, \"in that he has a new one\nevery year.\" Then she rested her hand on his, in a half-maternal\nfashion. \"What's the matter, boy?\" she asked, softly. \"You're always\nso fresh and wholesome. I don't like to see you like this. Better\nleave phrase-making to us phrase-mongers.\"\n\nHer voice rang true--true, and compassionate, and tender, and all that\na woman's voice should be. Billy could not but trust her.\n\n\"I've been an ass,\" said he, rather tragically. \"Oh, not an unusual\nass, Kathleen--just the sort men are always making of themselves. You\nsee, before I went to France, there was a girl I--cared for. And I let\na quarrel come between us--a foolish, trifling, idle little quarrel,\nKathleen, that we might have made up in a half-hour. But I was too\nproud, you see. No, I wasn't proud, either,\" Mr. Woods amended,\nbitterly; \"I was simply pig-headed and mulish. So I went away. And\nyesterday I saw her again and realised that I--still cared. That's\nall, Kathleen. It isn't an unusual story.\" And Mr. Woods laughed,\nmirthlessly, and took a turn on the terrace.\n\nMrs. Saumarez was regarding him intently. Her cheeks were of a deeper,\nmore attractive pink, and her breath came and went quickly.\n\n\"I--I don't understand,\" she said, in a rather queer voice.\n\n\"Oh, it's simple enough,\" Billy assured her. \"You see, she--well, I\nthink she would have married me once. Yes, she cared for me once. And\nI quarreled with her--I, conceited young ass that I was, actually\npresumed to dictate to the dearest, sweetest, most lovable woman on\nearth, and tell her what she must do and what she mustn't. I!--good\nLord, I, who wasn't worthy to sweep a crossing clean for her!--who\nwasn't worthy to breathe the same air with her!--who wasn't worthy to\nexist in the same world she honoured by living in! Oh, I _was_ an ass!\nBut I've paid for it!--oh, yes, Kathleen, I've paid dearly for it,\nand I'll pay more dearly yet before I've done. I tried to avoid her\nyesterday--you must have seen that. And I couldn't--I give you my\nword, I could no more have kept away from her than I could have spread\na pair of wings and flown away. She doesn't care a bit for me now; but\nI can no more give up loving her than I can give up eating my dinner.\nThat isn't a pretty simile, Kathleen, but it expresses the way I feel\ntoward her. It isn't merely that I want her; it's more than that--oh,\nfar more than that. I simply can't do without her. Don't you\nunderstand, Kathleen?\" he asked, desperately.\n\n\"Yes--I think I understand,\" she said, when he had ended. \"I--oh,\nBilly, I am almost sorry. It's dear of you--dear of you, Billy, to\ncare for me still, but--but I'm almost sorry you care so much. I'm not\nworth it, boy dear. And I--I really don't know what to say. You must\nlet me think.\"\n\nMr. Woods gave an inarticulate sound. The face she turned to him\nwas perplexed, half-sad, fond, a little pleased, and strangely\ncompassionate. It was Kathleen Eppes who sat beside him; the six years\nwere as utterly forgotten as the name of Magdalen's first lover. She\nwas a girl again, listening--with a heart that fluttered, I dare\nsay--to the wild talk, the mad dithyrambics of a big, blundering boy.\n\nThe ludicrous horror of it stunned Mr. Woods.\n\nHe could no more have told her of her mistake than he could have\nstruck her in the face.\n\n\"Kathleen--!\" said he, vaguely.\n\n\"Let me think!--ah, let me think, Billy!\" she pleaded, in a flutter of\njoy and amazement. \"Go away, boy dear!--Go away for a little and\nlet me think! I'm not an emotional woman, but I'm on the verge of\nhysterics now, for--for several reasons. Go in to breakfast, Billy!\nI--I want to be alone. You've made me very proud and--and sorry, I\nthink, and glad, and--and--oh, I don't know, boy dear. But please go\nnow--please!\"\n\nBilly went.\n\nIn the living-hall he paused to inspect a picture with peculiar\ninterest. Since Kathleen cared for him (he thought, rather forlornly),\nhe must perjure himself in as plausible a manner as might be possible;\nplease God, having done what he had done, he would lie to her like a\ngentleman and try to make her happy.\n\nA vision in incredible violet ruffles, coming down to breakfast, saw\nhim, and paused on the stairway, and flushed and laughed deliciously.\n\nPoor Billy stared at her; and his heart gave a great bound and then\nappeared to stop for an indefinite time.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said Mr. Woods, in his soul. \"And I thought I was an ass\nlast night! Why, last night, in comparison, I displayed intelligence\nthat was almost human! Oh, Peggy, Peggy! if I only dared tell you what\nI think of you, I believe I would gladly die afterward--yes, I'm sure\nI would. You really haven't any right to be so beautiful!--it isn't\nfair to us, Peggy!\"\n\nBut the vision was peeping over the bannisters at him, and the\nvision's eyes were sparkling with a lucent mischief and a wonderful,\nhalf-hushed contralto was demanding of him:\n\n  \"Oh, where have you been, Billy boy, Billy boy?\n   Oh, where have you been, charming Billy?\"\n\nAnd Billy's baritone answered her:\n\n  \"I've been to seek a wife--\"\n\nand broke off in a groan.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said Mr. Woods.\n\nIt was a ludicrous business, if you will. Indeed, it was vastly\nhumorous--was it not?--this woman's thinking a man's love might by any\nchance endure through six whole years. But their love endures, you\nsee; and the silly creatures have a superstition among them that love\nis a sacred thing, stronger than time, victorious over death itself.\nLet us laugh, then, at Kathleen Saumarez--those of us who have learned\nthat love is only a tinkling cymbal and faith a sounding brass and\nfidelity an obsolete affectation: but for my part, I honour and\nthink better of the woman who through all her struggles with the\nworld--through all those sordid, grim, merciless, secret battles where\nthe vanquished may not even cry for succour--I honour her, I say, for\nthat she had yet cherished the memory of that first love which is the\nbest and purest and most unselfish and most excellent thing in life.\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nBreakfast Margaret enjoyed hugely. I regret to confess that the fact\nthat every one of her guests was more or less miserable moved this\nhard-hearted young woman to untimely and excessive mirth. Only Mrs.\nSaumarez puzzled her, for she could think of no reason for that lady's\nmanifest agitation when Kathleen eventually joined the others.\n\nBut for the rest, the hopeless glances that Hugh Van Orden cast toward\nher caused Ad\u00e8le to flush, and Mrs. Haggage to become despondent and\nspeechless and astonishingly rigid; and Petheridge Jukesbury's vaguely\napologetic attitude toward the world struck Miss Hugonin as infinitely\ndiverting. Kennaston she pitied a little; but his bearing toward\nher ranged ludicrously from that of proprietorship to that of\nsupplication, and, moreover, she was furious with him for having\nhinted at various times that Billy was a fortune-hunter.\n\nMargaret was quite confident by this that she had never believed\nhim--\"not really, you know\"--having argued the point out at some\nlength the night before, and reaching her conclusion by a course of\nreasoning peculiar to herself.\n\nMr. Woods, as you may readily conceive, was sunk in the Slough of\nDespond deeper than ever plummet sounded. Margaret thought this very\nnice of him; it was a delicate tribute to her that he ate nothing;\nand the fact that Hugh Van Orden and Petheridge Jukesbury--as she\nbelieved--acted in precisely the same way for precisely the same\nreason, merely demonstrated, of course, their overwhelming conceit and\npresumption.\n\nSo sitting in the great Eagle's shadow, she ate a quantity of\nmarmalade--she was wont to begin the day in this ungodly English\nfashion--and gossiped like a brook trotting over sunlit pebbles. She\nhad planned a pulverising surprise for the house-party; and in due\ntime, she intended to explode it, and subsequently Billy was to\napologise for his conduct, and then they were to live happily ever\nafterward.\n\nShe had not yet decided what he was to apologise for; that was his\naffair. His conscience ought to have told him, by this, wherein he had\noffended; and if his conscience hadn't, why then, of course, he would\nhave to apologise for his lack of proper sensibility.\n\nAfter breakfast she went, according to her usual custom, to her\nfather's rooms, for, as I think I have told you, the old gentleman was\nnever visible until noon. She had astonishing news for him.\n\nWhat time she divulged it, the others sat on the terrace, and Mr.\nKennaston read to them, as he had promised, from his \"Defense of\nIgnorance.\" It proved a welcome diversion to more than one of the\nparty. Mr. Woods, especially, esteemed it a godsend; it staved off\nmisfortune for at least a little; so he sat at Kathleen's side in\nsilence, trying desperately to be happy, trying desperately not to see\nthe tiny wrinkles, the faint crow's feet Time had sketched in her face\nas a memorandum of the work he meant to do shortly.\n\nBilly consoled himself with the reflection that he was very fond of\nher; but, oh (he thought), what worship, what adoration he could\naccord this woman if she would only decline--positively--to have\nanything whatever to do with him!\n\nI think we ought not to miss hearing Mr. Kennaston's discourse. It is\ngenerally conceded that his style is wonderfully clever; and I have\nno doubt that his detractors--who complain that his style is mere\nword-twisting, a mere inversion of the most ancient truisms--are\nactuated by the very basest jealousy. Let us listen, then, and be duly\nedified as he reads in a low, sweet voice, and the birds twitter about\nhim in the clear morning.\n\n\"It has been for many years,\" Mr. Kennaston began, \"the custom of\npatriotic gentlemen in quest of office to point with pride to the fact\nthat the schoolmaster is abroad in the land, in whose defense they\nstand pledged to draw their salaries and fight to the last gasp\nfor reelection. These lofty platitudes, while trying to the lungs,\ndoubtless appeal to a certain class of minds. But, indeed, the\nschoolmaster is not abroad; he is domesticated in every village in\nAmerica, where each hamlet has its would-be Shakespeare, and each\nwould-be Shakespeare has his 'Hamlet' by heart. Learning is rampant in\nthe land, and valuable information is pasted up in the streetcars so\nthat he who rides may read.\n\n\"And Ignorance--beautiful, divine Ignorance--is forsaken by a\ngeneration that clamours for the truth. And what value, pray, has this\nTruth that we should lust after it?\"\n\nHe glanced up, in an inquiring fashion. Mr. Jukesbury, meeting his\neye, smiled and shook his head and said \"Fie, fie!\" very placidly.\n\nTo do him justice, he had not the least idea what Kennaston was\ntalking about.\n\n\"I am aware,\" the poet continued, with an air of generosity, \"that\nmany pleasant things have been said of it. In fact, our decade has\nturned its back relentlessly upon the decayed, and we no longer read\nthe lament over the lost art of lying issued many magazines ago by\na once prominent British author. Still, without advancing any Wilde\ntheories, one may fairly claim that truth is a jewel--a jewel with\nmany facets, differing in appearance from each point of view.\n\n\"And while 'Tell the truth and shame the Devil' is a very pretty\nsentiment, it need not necessarily mean anything. The Devil, if there\nbe a personal devil--and it has been pointed out, with some show of\nreason, that an impersonal one could scarcely carry out such enormous\ncontracts--would, in all probability, rather approve than otherwise of\nindiscriminate truth-telling. Irritation is the root of all evil; and\nthere is nothing more irritating than to hear the truth about one's\nself. It is bad enough, in all conscience, to be insulted, but the\ntruth of an insult is the barb that prevents its retraction. 'Truth\nhurts' has all the pathos of understatement. It not only hurts, but\ninfuriates. It has no more right to go naked in public than any one\nelse. Indeed, it has less right; for truth-telling is natural to\nmankind--as is shown by its prevalence among the younger sort, such as\nchildren and cynics--and, as Shakespeare long ago forgot to tell us, a\ntouch of nature makes the whole world embarrassed.\"\n\nAt this point Mrs. Haggage sniffed. She considered he was growing\nimproper. She distrusted Nature.\n\n\"Truth-telling, then, may safely be regarded as an unamiable\nindiscretion. In art, the bare truth must, in common gallantry, be\nawarded a print petticoat or one of canvas, as the case may be, to\nhide her nakedness; and in life, it is a disastrous virtue that we\nhave united to commend and avoid. Nor is the decision an unwise one;\nfor man is a gregarious animal, knowing that friendship is, at best,\nbut a feeble passion and therefore to be treated with the care due an\ninvalid. It is impossible to be quite candid in conversation with a\nman; and with a woman it is absolutely necessary that your speech\nshould be candied.\n\n\"Truth, then, is the least desirable of acquaintances.\n\n\"But even if one wished to know the truth, the desire could scarcely\nbe fulfilled. Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, a prominent lawyer of\nElizabeth's time, who would have written Shakespeare's plays had his\nother occupations not prevented it, quotes Pilate as inquiring, 'What\nis Truth?'--and then not staying for an answer. Pilate deserves all\nthe praise he has never received. Nothing is quite true. Even Truth\nlies at the bottom of a well and not infrequently in other places. No\nassertion is one whit truer than its opposite.\"\n\nA mild buzz of protest rose about him. Kennaston smiled and cocked his\nhead on one side.\n\n\"We have, for example,\" he pointed out, \"a large number of proverbs,\nthe small coin of conversation, received everywhere, whose value no\none disputes. They are rapped forth, like an oath, with an air of\nsettling the question once and forever. Well! there is safety in\nquotations. But even the Devil can cite Shakespeare for his purpose.\n'Never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day' agrees ill with\n'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof'; and it is somewhat\ndifficult to reconcile 'Take care of the pence, and the pounds will\ntake care of themselves' with the equally familiar 'Penny-wise,\npound-foolish.' Yet the sayings are equally untrue; any maxim is,\nperforce, a general statement, and therefore fallacious, and therefore\nuniversally accepted. Art is long, and life is short, but the\nplatitudes concerning them are both insufferable and eternal. We must\nremember that a general statement is merely a snap-shot at flying\ntruth, an instantaneous photograph of a moving body. It may be the way\nthat a thing is; but it is never the way in which any one ever saw\nthat thing, or ever will. This is, of course, a general statement.\n\n\"As to present events, then, it may be assumed that no one is either\ncapable or desirous of speaking the truth; why, then, make such\na pother about it as to the past? There we have carried the\ninvestigation of truth to such an extreme that nowadays very few of us\ndare believe anything. Opinions are difficult to secure when a quarter\nof an hour in the library will prove either side of any question.\nFormerly, people had a few opinions, which, if erroneous, were at\nleast universal. Nero was not considered an immaculate man. The Flood\nwas currently believed to have caused the death of quite a number of\npersons. And George Washington, it was widely stated, once cut down\na cherry-tree. But now all these comfortable illusions have been\ndestroyed by 'the least little men who spend their time and lose their\nwits in chasing nimble and retiring truth, to the extreme perturbation\nand drying up of the moistures.'\"\n\nKennaston looked up for a moment, and Billy Woods, who had counted\nseven wrinkles and was dropping into a forlorn doze, started\nviolently. His interest then became abnormal.\n\n\"There are,\" Mr. Kennaston complained, rather reproachfully, \"too many\ninquiries, doubts, investigations, discoveries, and apologies. There\nare palliations of Tiberius, eulogies of Henry VIII., rehabilitations\nof Aaron Burr. Lucretia Borgia, it appears, was a grievously\nmisunderstood woman, and Heliogabalus a most exemplary monarch; even\nthe dog in the manger may have been a nervous animal in search of\nrest and quiet. As for Shakespeare, he was an atheist, a syndicate, a\nlawyer's clerk, an inferior writer, a Puritan, a scholar, a _nom de\nplume_, a doctor of medicine, a fool, a poacher, and another man of\nthe same name. Information of this sort crops up on every side. Even\nthe newspapers are infected; truth lurks in the patent-medicine\nadvertisements, and sometimes creeps stealthily into the very\neditorials. We must all learn the true facts of history, whether we\nwill or no; eventually, the writers of historical romance will not\nescape.\n\n\"So the sad tale goes. Ignorance--beautiful, divine Ignorance--is\nforsaken by a generation that clamours for the truth. The\nearnest-minded person has plucked Zeus out of Heaven, and driven the\nMaenad from the wood, and dragged Poseidon out of his deep-sea palace.\nThe conclaves of Olympus, it appears, are merely nature-myths;\nthe stately legends clustering about them turn out to be a rather\nelaborate method of expressing the fact that it occasionally rains.\nThe heroes who endured their angers and jests and tragic loves are\ndelicately veiled allusions to the sun--surely, a very harmless topic\nof conversation, even in Greece; and the monsters, 'Gorgons and Hydras\nand Chim\u00e6ras dire,' their grisly offspring, their futile opponents,\nare but personified frosts. Mythology--the poet's necessity, the\nfertile mother of his inventions--has become a series of atmospheric\nphenomena, and the labours of Hercules prove to be a dozen weather\nbulletins.\n\n\"Is it any cause for wonder, that under this cheerless influence our\npoetry is either silent or unsold? The true poet must be ignorant, for\ninformation is the thief of rhyme. And it is only in dealing with--\"\n\nKennaston paused. Margaret had appeared in the vestibule, and behind\nher stood her father, looking very grave.\n\n\"We have made a most interesting discovery,\" Miss Hugonin airily\nannounced to the world at large. \"It appears that Uncle Fred left all\nhis property to Mr. Woods here. We found the will only last night. I'm\nsure you'll all be interested to learn I'm a pauper now, and intend to\nsupport myself by plain sewing. Any work of this nature you may\nchoose to favour me with, ladies and gentlemen, will receive my most\n_earnest_ attention.\"\n\nShe dropped a courtesy. The scene appealed to her taste for the\ndramatic.\n\nBilly came toward her quickly.\n\n\"Peggy,\" he demanded of her, in the semi-privacy of the vestibule,\n\"will you kindly elucidate the meaning of this da--this idiotic\nfoolishness?\"\n\n\"Why, this,\" she explained, easily, and exhibited a folded paper. \"I\nfound it in the grate last night.\"\n\nHe inspected it with large eyes. \"That's absurd,\" he said, at length.\n\"You know perfectly well this will isn't worth the paper it's written\non.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" she informed him, coldly, \"you are vastly mistaken. You\nsee, I've burned the other one.\" She pushed by him. \"Mr. Kennaston,\nare you ready for our walk? We'll finish the paper some other time.\nWasn't it the strangest thing in the world--?\" Her dear, deep, mellow\nvoice died away as she and Kennaston disappeared in the gardens.\n\nBilly gasped.\n\nBut meanwhile, Colonel Hugonin had given the members of his daughter's\nhouse-party some inkling as to the present posture of affairs. They\nwere gazing at Billy Woods rather curiously. He stood in the vestibule\nof Selwoode, staring after Margaret Hugonin; but they stared at him,\nand over his curly head, sculptured above the door-way, they saw the\nEagle--the symbol of the crude, incalculable power of wealth.\n\nMr. Woods stood in the vestibule of his own house.\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\"By gad!\" said Colonel Hugonin, very grimly, \"anybody would think\nyou'd just lost a fortune instead of inheriting one! Wish you joy of\nit, Billy. I ain't saying, you know, we shan't miss it, my daughter\nand I--no, begad, for it's a nice pot of money, and we'll miss it\ndamnably. But since somebody had to have it, I'd much rather it was\nyou, my boy, than a set of infernal, hypocritical, philanthropic\nsharks, and I'm damn' glad Frederick has done the square thing by\nyou--yes, begad!\"\n\nThe old gentleman was standing beside Mr. Woods in the vestibule of\nSelwoode, some distance from the other members of the house-party,\nand was speaking in confidence. He was sincere; I don't say that\nthe thought of facing the world at sixty-five with practically\nno resources save his half-pay--I think I have told you that the\nColonel's diversions had drunk up his wife's fortune and his own like\na glass of water--I don't say that this thought moved him to hilarity.\nOver it, indeed, he pulled a frankly grave face.\n\nBut he cared a deal for Billy; and even now there was balm--soothing,\npriceless balm--to be had of the reflection that this change in\nhis prospects affected materially the prospects of those cultured,\nbroad-minded, philanthropic persons who had aforetime set his daughter\nto requiring of him a perusal of Herbert Spencer.\n\nBilly was pretty well aware how monetary matters stood with the old\nwastrel; and the sincerity of the man affected him far more than the\nmost disinterested sentiments would have done. Mr. Woods accordingly\nshook hands, with entirely unnecessary violence.\n\n\"You're a trump, that's what you are!\" he declared; \"oh, yes, you are,\nColonel! You're an incorrigible, incurable old ace of trumps--the\nvery best there is in the pack--and it's entirely useless for you to\nattempt to conceal it.\"\n\n\"Gad----!\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"And don't you worry about that will,\" Mr. Woods advised. \"I--I can't\nexplain things just now, but it's all right. You just wait--just wait\ntill I've seen Peggy,\" Billy urged, in desperation, \"and I'll explain\neverything.\"\n\n\"By gad----!\" said the Colonel. But Mr. Woods was half-way out of the\nvestibule.\n\nMr. Woods was in an unenviable state of perturbation.\n\nHe could not quite believe that Peggy had destroyed the will; the\nthing out-Heroded Herod, out-Margareted Margaret. But if she had,\nit struck him as a high-handed proceeding, entailing certain\nvague penalties made and provided by the law to cover just such\ncases--penalties of whose nature he was entirely ignorant and didn't\ncare to think. Heavens! for all he knew, that angel might have let\nherself in for a jail sentence.\n\nBilly pictured that queen among women! that paragon! with her glorious\nhair cropped and her pink-tipped little hands set to beating hemp--he\nhad a shadowy notion that the lives of all female convicts were\ndevoted to this pursuit--and groaned in horror.\n\n\"In the name of Heaven!\" Mr. Woods demanded of his soul, \"what\n_possible_ reason could she have had for this new insanity? And in the\nname of Heaven, why couldn't she have put off her _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ with\nKennaston long enough to explain? And in the name of Heaven, what does\nshe see to admire in that putty-faced, grimacing ass, any way! And in\nthe name of Heaven, what am I to say to this poor, old man here? I\ncan't explain that his daughter isn't in any danger of being poor, but\nmerely of being locked up in jail! And in the name of Heaven, how\nlong does that outrageous angel expect me to remain in this state of\nsuspense!\"\n\nBilly groaned again and paced the vestibule. Then he retraced his\nsteps, shook hands with Colonel Hugonin once more, and, Kennaston or\nno Kennaston, set out to find her.\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nBut when he came out upon the terrace, Sarah Ellen Haggage stopped\nhim--stopped him with a queer blending of diffidence and resolve in\nher manner.\n\nThe others, by this, had disappeared in various directions, puzzled\nand exceedingly uncertain what to do. Indeed, to congratulate Billy\nin the Colonel's presence would have been tactless; and, on the other\nhand, to condole with the Colonel without seeming to affront the\nwealthy Mr. Woods was almost impossible. So they temporised and\nfled--all save Mrs. Haggage.\n\nShe, alone, remained to view Mr. Woods with newly opened eyes; for\nas he paused impatiently--the sculptured Eagle above his head--she\nperceived that he was a remarkably handsome and intelligent young man.\nHer motherly heart opened toward this lonely, wealthy orphan.\n\n\"My dear Billy,\" she cooed, with asthmatic gentleness, \"as an old,\nold friend of your mother's, aren't you going to let me tell you how\nrejoiced Ad\u00e8le and I are over your good fortune? It isn't polite, you\nnaughty boy, for you to run away from your friends as soon as they've\nheard this wonderful news. Ah, such news it was--such a manifest\nintervention of Providence! My heart has been fluttering, fluttering\nlike a little bird, Billy, ever since I heard it.\"\n\nIn testimony to this fact, Mrs. Haggage clasped a stodgy hand to an\nexceedingly capacious bosom, and exhibited the whites of her eyes\nfreely. Her smile, however, remained unchanged and ample.\n\n\"Er--ah--oh, yes! Very kind of you, I'm sure!\" said Mr. Woods.\n\n\"I never in my life saw Ad\u00e8le so deeply affected by _anything_,\" Mrs.\nHaggage continued, with a certain large archness. \"The sweet child\nwas always so fond of you, you know, Billy. Ah, I remember distinctly\nhearing her speak of you many and many a time when you were in that\ndear, delightful, wicked Paris, and wonder when you would come back\nto your friends--not very grand and influential friends, Billy, but\nsincere, I trust, for all that.\"\n\nMr. Woods said he had no doubt of it.\n\n\"So many people,\" she informed him, confidentially, \"will pursue you\nwith adulation now that you are wealthy. Oh, yes, you will find that\nwealth makes a great difference, Billy. But not with Ad\u00e8le and\nme--no, dear boy, despise us if you will, but my child and I are not\nmercenary. Money makes no difference with us; we shall be the same to\nyou that we always were--sincerely interested in your true welfare,\noverjoyed at your present good fortune, prayerful as to your brilliant\nfuture, and delighted to have you drop in any evening to dinner. We do\nnot consider money the chief blessing of life; no, don't tell me that\nmost people are different, Billy, for I know it very well, and many is\nthe tear that thought has cost me. We live in a very mercenary world,\nmy dear boy; but _our_ thoughts, at least, are set on higher things,\nand I trust we can afford to despise the merely temporal blessings of\nlife, and I entreat you to remember that our humble dwelling is always\nopen to the son of my old, old friend, and that there is always a jug\nof good whiskey in the cupboard.\"\n\nThus in the shadow of the Eagle babbled the woman whom--for all her\nabsurdities--Margaret had loved as a mother.\n\nBilly thanked her with an angry heart.\n\n\"And this\"--I give you the gist of his meditations--\"this is Peggy's\ndearest friend! Oh, Philanthropy, are thy protestations, then, all\nvoid and empty, and are thy noblest sentiments--every one of 'em--so\nfull of sound and rhetoric, so specious, so delectable--are these,\nthen, but dicers' oaths!\"\n\nAloud, \"I'm rather surprised, you know,\" he said, slowly, \"that you\ntake it just this way, Mrs. Haggage. I should have thought you'd have\nbeen sorry on--on Miss Hugonin's account. It's awfully jolly of you,\nof course--oh, awfully jolly, and I appreciate it at its true worth, I\nassure you. But it's a bit awkward, isn't it, that the poor girl will\nbe practically penniless? I really don't know whom she'll turn to\nnow.\"\n\nThen Billy, the diplomatist, received a surprise.\n\n\"She'll come with me, of course,\" said Mrs. Haggage.\n\nMr. Woods made an--unfortunately--inaudible observation.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" she queried. Then, obtaining no response, she\ncontinued, with perfect simplicity: \"Margaret's quite like a daughter\nto me, you know. Of course, she and the Colonel will come with us--at\nleast, until affairs are a bit more settled. Even afterward--well, we\nhave a large house, Billy, and I don't see that they'd be any better\noff anywhere else.\"\n\nBilly's emotions were complex.\n\n\"You big-hearted old parasite,\" his own heart was singing. \"If you\ncould only keep that ring of truth that's in your voice for your\nplatform utterances--why, in less than no time you could afford to\nfeed your Afro-Americans on nightingales' tongues and clothe every\nworking-girl in the land in cloth of gold! You've been pilfering from\nPeggy for years--pilfering right and left with both hands! But you've\nloved her all the time, God bless you; and now the moment she's in\ntrouble you're ready to take both her and the Colonel--whom, by the\nway, you must very cordially detest--and share your pitiful, pilfered\nlittle crusts with 'em and--having two more mouths to feed--probably\npilfer a little more outrageously in the future! You're a\nsanctimonious old hypocrite, you are, and a pious fraud, and a\ndelusion, and a snare, and you and Ad\u00e8le have nefarious designs on me\nat this very moment, but I think I'd like to kiss you!\"\n\nIndeed, I believe Mr. Woods came very near doing so. She loved Peggy,\nyou see; and he loved every one who loved her.\n\nBut he compromised by shaking hands energetically, for a matter of\nfive minutes, and entreating to be allowed to subscribe to some of her\ndeserving charitable enterprises--any one she might mention--and so\nleft the old lady a little bewildered, but very much pleased.\n\nShe decided that for the future Ad\u00e8le must not see so much of Mr.\nVan Orden. She began to fear that gentleman's views of life were not\nsufficiently serious.\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nBilly went into the gardens in pursuit of Margaret. He was almost\nhappy now and felt vaguely ashamed of himself. Then he came upon\nKathleen Saumarez, who, indeed, was waiting for him there; and his\nheart went down into his boots.\n\nHe realised on a sudden that he was one of the richest men in America.\nIt was a staggering thought. Also, Mr. Woods's views, at this moment,\nas to the advantages of wealth, might have been interesting.\n\nKathleen stood silent for an instant, eyes downcast, face flushed. She\nwas trembling.\n\nThen, \"Billy,\" she asked, almost inaudibly, \"do--do you still\nwant--your answer?\"\n\nThe birds sang about them. Spring triumphed in the gardens. She looked\nvery womanly and very pretty.\n\nTo all appearances, it might easily have been a lover and his lass met\nin the springtide, shamefaced after last night's kissing. But Billy,\nsomehow, lacked much of the elation and the perfect content and the\ndisposition to burst into melody that is currently supposed to seize\nupon rustic swains at such moments. He merely wanted to know if at\nany time in the remote future his heart would be likely to resume the\ndischarge of its proper functions. It was standing still now.\n\nHowever, \"Can you ask--dear?\" His words, at least, lied gallantly.\n\nThe poor woman looked up into Billy's face. After years of battling\nwith the world, here for the asking was peace and luxury and wealth\nincalculable, and--as Kathleen thought--a love that had endured since\nthey were boy and girl together. Yet she shrunk from him a little and\nclinched her hands before she spoke.\n\n\"Yes,\" Kathleen faltered, and afterward she shuddered.\n\nAnd here, if for the moment I may prefigure the Eagle as a sentient\nbeing, I can imagine his chuckle.\n\n\"Please God,\" thought poor Billy, \"I will make her happy. Yes, please\nGod, I can at least do that, since she cares for me.\"\n\nThen he kissed her.\n\n\"My dear,\" said he, aloud, \"I'll try to make you happy. And--and you\ndon't mind, do you, if I leave you now?\" queried this ardent lover.\n\"You see, it's absolutely necessary I should see--see Miss Hugonin\nabout this will business. You don't mind very much, do you--darling?\"\nMr. Woods inquired of her, the last word being rather obviously an\nafterthought.\n\n\"No,\" said she. \"Not if you must--dear.\"\n\nBilly went away, lugging a heart of lead in his breast.\n\nKathleen stared after him and gave a hard, wringing motion of her\nhands. She had done what many women do daily; the thing is common and\nsensible and universally commended; but in her own eyes, the draggled\ntrollop of the pavements was neither better nor worse than she.\n\nAt the entrance of the next walkway Billy encountered Felix\nKennaston--alone and in the most ebulliently mirthful of humours.\n\n\n\nXX\n\nBut we had left Mr. Kennaston, I think, in company with Miss Hugonin,\nat the precise moment she inquired of him whether it were not the\nstrangest thing in the world--referring thereby to the sudden manner\nin which she had been disinherited.\n\nThe poet laughed and assented. Afterward, turning north from the front\ncourt, they descended past the shield-bearing griffins--and you may\ndepend upon it that each shield is adorned with a bas-relief of the\nEagle--that guard the broad stairway leading to the formal gardens\nof Selwoode. The gardens stretch northward to the confines of Peter\nBlagden's estate of Gridlington; and for my part--unless it were that\nprimitive garden that Adam lost--I can imagine no goodlier place.\n\nOn this particular forenoon, however, neither Miss Hugonin nor Felix\nKennaston had eyes for its comeliness; silently they braved the\ngriffins, and in silence they skirted the fish-pond--silver-crinkling\nin the May morning--and passed through cloistral ilex-shadowed walks,\nand amphitheatres of green velvet, and terraces ample and mellow\nin the sunlight, silently. The trees pelted them with blossoms;\npedestaled in leafy recesses, Satyrs grinned at them apishly, and the\narrows of divers pot-bellied Cupids threatened them, and Fauns piped\nfor them ditties of no tone; the birds were about shrill avocations\noverhead, and everywhere the heatless, odourful air was a caress; but\nfor all this, Miss Hugonin and Mr. Kennaston were silent and very\nfidgetty.\n\nMargaret was hatless--and the glory of the eminently sensible spring\nsun appeared to centre in her hair--and violet-clad; and the gown,\nlike most of her gowns, was all tiny tucks and frills and flounces,\ndiapered with semi-transparencies--unsubstantial, foam-like, mere\nviolet froth. As she came starry-eyed through the gardens, the\nimpudent wind trifling with her hair, I protest she might have been\nsome lady of Oberon's court stolen out of Elfland to bedevil us poor\nmortals, with only a moonbeam for the changeable heart of her, and\nfor raiment a violet shadow spirited from the under side of some big,\nfleecy cloud.\n\nThey came presently through a trim, yew-hedged walkway to a\nsummer-house covered with vines, into which Margaret peeped and\ndeclined to enter, on the ground that it was entirely too chilly\nand gloomy and _exactly_ like a mausoleum; but nearby they found a\nsemi-circular marble bench about which a group of elm-trees made a\npleasant shadow splashed at just the proper intervals with sunlight.\n\nOn this Margaret seated herself; and then pensively moved to the other\nend of the bench, because a slanting sunbeam fell there. Since it\nwas absolutely necessary to blast Mr. Kennaston's dearest hopes,\nshe thoughtfully endeavoured to distract his attention from his own\nmiseries--as far as might be possible--by showing him how exactly like\nan aureole her hair was in the sunlight. Margaret always had a kind\nheart.\n\nKennaston stood before her, smiling a little. He was the sort of man\nto appreciate the manoeuver.\n\n\"My lady,\" he asked, very softly, \"haven't you any good news for me on\nthis wonderful morning?\"\n\n\"Excellent news,\" Margaret assented, with a cheerfulness that was\nnot utterly free from trepidation. \"I've decided not to marry you,\nbeautiful, and I trust you're properly grateful. You see, you're very\nnice, of course, but I'm going to marry somebody else, and bigamy is\na  crime, you know; and, anyhow, I'm only a pauper, and you'd never be\nable to put up with my temper--now, beautiful, I'm quite sure you\ncouldn't, so there's not a bit of use in arguing it. Some day you'd\nend by strangling me, which would be horribly disagreeable for me, and\nthen they'd hang you for it, you know, and that would be equally\ndisagreeable for you. Fancy, though, what a good advertisement it would\nbe for your poems!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'My lady,' he asked, very softly, 'haven't you any\ngood news for me on this wonderful morning?'\"]\n\nShe was not looking at him now--oh, no, Margaret was far too busily\nemployed getting the will (which she had carried all this time) into\nan absurd little silver chain-bag hanging at her waist. She had no\ntime to look at Felix Kennaston. There was such scant room in the bag;\nher purse took up so much space there was scarcely any left for the\nfolded paper; the affair really required her closest, undivided\nattention. Besides, she had not the least desire to look at Kennaston\njust now.\n\n\"Beautiful child,\" he pleaded, \"look at me!\"\n\nBut she didn't.\n\nShe felt that at that moment she could have looked at a gorgon, say,\nor a cockatrice, or any other trifle of that nature with infinitely\ngreater composure. The pause that followed Margaret accordingly\ndevoted to a scrutiny of his shoes and sincere regret that their owner\nwas not a mercenary man who would be glad to be rid of her.\n\n\"Beautiful child,\" spoke the poet's voice, sadly, \"you aren't--surely,\nyou aren't saying this in mistaken kindness to me? Surely, you aren't\nsaying this because of what has happened in regard to your money\naffairs? Believe me, my dear, that makes no difference to me. It\nis you I love--you, the woman of my heart--and not a certain, and\ndoubtless desirable, amount of metal disks and dirty paper.\"\n\n\"Now I suppose you're going to be very noble and very nasty about it,\"\nobserved Miss Hugonin, resentfully. \"That's my main objection to\nyou, you know, that you haven't any faults I can recognise and feel\nfamiliar and friendly with.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" he protested, \"I assure you I am not intentionally\ndisagreeable.\"\n\nAt that, she raised velvet eyes to his--with a visible effort,\nthough--and smiled.\n\n\"I know you far too well to think that,\" she said, wistfully. \"I\nknow I'm not worthy of you. I'm tremendously fond of you, beautiful,\nbut--but, you see, I love somebody else,\" Margaret concluded, with\nadmirable candour.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, in a rather curious voice. \"The painter chap, eh?\"\n\nThen Margaret's face flamed in a wonderful glow of shame and happiness\nand pride that must have made the surrounding roses very hopelessly\njealous. A quaint mothering look, sacred, divine, Madonna-like,\nwoke in her great eyes as she thought--remorsefully--of\nhow unhappy Billy must be at that very moment and of how big he was\nand of his general niceness; and she desired, very heartily, that this\nfleshy young man would make his scene and have done with it. Who was\nhe, forsooth, to keep her from Billy? She wished she had never heard\nof Felix Kennaston.\n\n_Souvent femme varie_, my brothers.\n\nHowever, \"Yes,\" said Margaret..\n\n\"You are a dear,\" said Mr. Kennaston, with conviction in his voice.\n\nI dare say Margaret was surprised.\n\nBut the poet had taken her hand and had kissed it reverently, and then\nsat down beside her, twisting one foot under him in a fashion he had.\nHe was frankly grateful to her for refusing him; and, the mask of\naffectation slipped, she saw in him another man.\n\n\"I am an out-and-out fraud,\" he confessed, with the gayest of smiles.\n\"I am not in love with you, and I am inexpressibly glad that you are\nnot in love with me. Oh, Margaret, Margaret--you don't mind if I call\nyou that, do you? I shall have to, in any event, because I like you so\ntremendously now that we are not going to be married--you have no idea\nwhat a night I spent.\"\n\n\"I consider it most peculiar and unsympathetic of my hair not to have\nturned gray. I thought you were going to have me, you see.\"\n\nMargaret was far to much astonished to be angry.\n\n\"But last night!\" she presently echoed, in candid surprise. \"Why, last\nnight you didn't know I was poor!\"\n\nHe wagged a protesting forefinger. \"That made no earthly difference,\"\nhe assured her. \"Of course, it was the money--and in some degree the\nmoon--that induced me to make love to you. I acted on the impulse of\nthe moment; just for an instant, the novelty of doing a perfectly\nsensible thing--and marrying money is universally conceded to come\nunder that head--appealed to me. So I did it. But all the time I was\nin love with Kathleen Saumarez. Why, the moment I left you, I began to\nrealise that not even you--and you are quite the most fascinating and\ngenerally adorable woman I ever knew, Margaret--I began to realise, I\nsay, that not even you could ever make me forget that fact. And I\nwas very properly miserable. It is extremely queer,\" Mr. Kennaston\ncontinued, after an interval of meditation, \"but falling in love\nappears to be the one utterly inexplicable, utterly reasonless thing\none ever does in one's life. You can usually think of some more or\nless plausible palliation for embezzlement, say, or for robbing a\ncathedral or even for committing suicide--but no man can ever explain\nhow he happened to fall in love. He simply did it.\"\n\nMargaret nodded sagely. She knew.\n\n\"Now you,\" Mr. Kennaston was pleased to say, \"are infinitely more\nbeautiful, younger, more clever, and in every way more attractive than\nKathleen. I recognise these things clearly, but it does not appear,\nsomehow, to alter the fact that I am in love with her. I think I have\nbeen in love with her all my life. We were boy and girl together,\nMargaret, and--and I give you my word,\" Kennaston cried, with his\nboyish flush, \"I worship her! I simply cannot explain the perfectly\nunreasonable way in which I worship her!\"\n\nHe was sincere. He loved Kathleen Saumarez as much as he was capable\nof loving any one--almost as much as he loved to dilate on his own\npeculiarities and emotions.\n\nMargaret's gaze was intent upon him. \"Yet,\" she marvelled, \"you made\nlove to me very tropically.\"\n\nWith unconcealed pride, Mr. Kennaston assented. \"Didn't I?\" he said.\n\"I was in rather good form last night, I thought.\"\n\n\"And you were actually prepared to marry me?\" she asked--\"even after\nyou knew I was poor?\"\n\n\"I couldn't very well back out,\" he submitted, and then cocked\nhis head on one side. \"You see,\" he added, whimsically, \"I was\nsufficiently a conceited ass to fancy you cared a little for me. So,\nof course, I was going to marry you and try to make you happy. But how\ndear--oh, how unutterably dear it was of you, Margaret, to decline\nto be made happy in any such fashion!\" And Mr. Kennaston paused to\nchuckle and to regard her with genuine esteem and affection.\n\nBut still her candid eyes weighed him, and transparently found him\nwanting.\n\n\"You are thinking, perhaps, what an unutterable cad I have been?\" he\nsuggested.\n\n\"Yes--you are rather by way of being a cad, beautiful. But I can't\nhelp liking you, somehow. I dare say it's because you're honest\nwith me. Nobody--nobody,\" Miss Hugonin lamented, a forlorn little\nquiver in her voice, \"_ever_ seemed to be honest with me except you,\nand now I know you weren't. Oh, beautiful, aren't I ever to have any\nreal friends?\" she pleaded, wistfully.\n\nKennaston had meant a deal to her, you see; he had been the one\nman she trusted. She had gloried in his fustian rhetoric, his glib\nartlessness, his airy scorn of money; and now all this proved mere\npinchbeck. On a sudden, too, there woke in some bycorner of her heart\na queasy realisation of how near she had come to loving Kennaston. The\nthought nauseated her.\n\n\"My dear,\" he answered, kindly, \"you will have any number of friends\nnow that you are poor. It was merely your money that kept you from\nhaving any. You see,\" Mr. Kennaston went on, with somewhat the air of\none climbing upon his favourite hobby, \"money is the only thing\nthat counts nowadays. In America, the rich are necessarily our only\naristocracy. It is quite natural. One cannot hope for an aristocracy\nof intellect, if only for the reason that not one person in a thousand\nhas any; and birth does not count for much. Of course, it is quite\ntrue that all of our remote ancestors came over with William the\nConqueror--I have sometimes thought that the number of steerage\npassengers his ships would accommodate must have been little short of\nmarvellous--but it is equally true that the grandfathers of most of\nour leisure class were either deserving or dishonest persons--who\neither started life on a farm, and studied Euclid by the firelight and\ndid all the other priggish things they thought would look well in a\nbiography, or else met with marked success in embezzlement. So money,\nafter all, is our only standard; and when a woman is as rich as you\nwere yesterday she cannot hope for friends any more than the Queen\nof England can. You could have plenty of flatterers, toadies,\nsycophants--anything, in fine, but friends.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Margaret, half angrily--\"not a word of it.\nThere _must_ be some honest people in the world who don't consider\nthat money is everything. You know there must be, beautiful!\"\n\nThe poet laughed. \"That,\" said he, affably, \"is poppycock. You are\nrepeating the sort of thing I said to you yesterday. I am honest now.\nThe best of us, Margaret, cannot help being impressed by the power of\nmoney. It is the greatest power in the world, and we cannot--cannot\npossibly--look upon rich people as being quite like us. We must\ntoady to them a bit, Margaret, whether we want to or not. The Eagle\nintimidates us all.\"\n\n\"I _hate_ him!\" Miss Hugonin announced, with vehemence.\n\nKennaston searched his pockets. After a moment he produced a dollar\nbill and showed her the Eagle on it.\n\n\"There,\" he said, gravely, \"is the original of the Woods Eagle--the\nEagle that intimidates us all. Do you remember what Shakespeare--one\nalways harks back to Shakespeare to clinch an argument, because not\neven our foremost actors have been able to conceal the fact that he\nwas, as somebody in Dickens acutely points out, 'a dayvilish clever\nfellow'--do you remember. I say, what Shakespeare observes as to this\nvery Eagle?\"\n\nMiss Hugonin shook her little head till it glittered in the sunlight\nlike a topaz. She cared no more for Shakespeare than the average woman\ndoes, and she was never quite comfortable when he was alluded to.\n\n  \"He says,\" Mr. Kennaston quoted, solemnly:\n  \"The Eagle suffers little birds to sing,\n  And is not careful what they mean thereby,\n  Knowing that with the shadow of his wing\n  He can at pleasure still their melody.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" said Margaret, calmly. \"I haven't the _least_ idea\nwhat you're talking about, and I don't believe you have either.\"\n\nHe waved the dollar bill with a heroical gesture. \"Here,\" he asserted,\n\"is the Eagle. And by the little birds, I have not a doubt he meant\ncharity and independence and kindliness and truth and the rest of the\nstandard virtues. That is quite as plausible as the interpretation of\nthe average commentator. The presence of money chills these little\nbirds--ah, it is lamentable, no doubt, but it is true.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Margaret--quite as if that settled the\nquestion.\n\nBut now his hobby, rowelled by opposition, was spurred to loftier\nflights.\n\n\"Ah, the power of these great fortunes America has bred is monstrous,\"\nhe suddenly cried. \"And always they work for evil. If I were ever to\nwrite a melodrama, Margaret, I could wish for no more thorough-paced\nvillain than a large fortune.\" Kennaston paused and laughed grimly.\n\"We cringe to the Eagle!\" said he. \"Eh, well, why not? The Eagle is\nvery powerful and very cruel. In the South yonder, the Eagle has\npenned over a million children in his factories, where day by day he\ndrains the youth and health and very life out of their tired bodies;\nin sweat-shops, men and women are toiling for the Eagle, giving their\nlives for the pittance that he grudges them; in countless mines and\nmills, the Eagle is trading human lives for coal and flour; in\nWall Street yonder, the Eagle is juggling as he will with life's\nnecessities--thieving from the farmer, thieving from the consumer,\nthieving from the poor fools who try to play the Eagle's game, and\ndriving them at will to despair and ruin and death: look whither you\nmay, men die that the Eagle may grow fat. So the Eagle thrives, and\ndaily the rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer, and the end----\"\nKennaston paused, staring into vacancy. \"Eh, well,\" said he, with a\nsmile and a snap of his fingers, \"the end rests upon the knees of\nthe gods. But there must need be an end some day. And meanwhile, you\ncannot blame us if we cringe to the Eagle that is master of the world.\nIt is human nature to cringe to its master; and while human nature\nis not always an admirable thing, it is, I believe, rather widely\ndistributed.\"\n\nMargaret did not return the smile. Like any sensible woman, she never\ntolerated opinions that differed from her own.\n\nSo she waved his preachment aside. \"You're trying to be eloquent,\" was\nher observation, \"and you've only succeeded in being very silly and\ntiresome. Go away, beautiful. You make me awfully tired, and I don't\ncare for you in the least. Go and talk to Kathleen. I shall be\nhere--on this very spot,\" Margaret added, with commendable precision\nand an unaccountable increase of colour, \"if--if any one should happen\nto ask.\"\n\nThen Kennaston rose and laughed merrily.\n\n\"You are quite delicious,\" he commented. \"It will always be a\ngrief and a puzzle to me that I am not mad for love of you. It is\nunreasonable of me,\" he complained, sadly, and shook his head, \"but I\nprefer Kathleen. And I am quite certain that somebody will ask where\nyou are. I shall describe to him the exact spot--\"\n\nMr. Kennaston paused, with a slight air of apology.\n\n\"If I were you,\" he suggested, pleasantly, \"I would move a\nlittle--just a little--to the left. That will enable you to obtain to\na fuller extent the benefit of the sunbeam which is falling--quite\nby accident, of course--upon your hair. You are perfectly right,\nMargaret, in selecting that hedge as a background. Its sombre green\nsets you off to perfection.\"\n\nHe went away chuckling. He felt that Margaret must think him a devil\nof a fellow.\n\nShe didn't, though.\n\n\"The _idea_ of his suspecting me of such unconscionable vanity!\" she\nsaid, properly offended. Then, \"Anyhow, a man has no business to know\nabout such things,\" she continued, with rising indignation. \"I believe\nFelix Kennaston is as good a judge of chiffons as any woman. That's\neffeminate, I think, and catty and absurd. I don't believe I ever\nliked him--not really, that is. Now, what would Billy care about\nsunbeams and backgrounds, I'd like to know! He'd never even notice\nthem. Billy is a _man_. Why, that's just what father said yesterday!\"\nMargaret cried, and afterward laughed happily. \"I suppose old people\nare right sometimes--but, dear, dear, they're terribly unreasonable at\nothers!\"\n\nHaving thus uttered the ancient, undying plaint of youth, Miss Hugonin\nmoved a matter of two inches to the left, and smiled, and waited\ncontentedly. It was barely possible some one might come that way; and\nit is always a comfort to know that one is not exactly repulsive in\nappearance.\n\nAlso, there was the spring about her; and, chief of all, there was a\nqueer fluttering in her heart that was yet not unpleasant. In fine,\nshe was unreasonably happy for no reason at all.\n\nI believe the foolish poets call this feeling love and swear it\nis divine; however, they will say anything for the sake of an\near-tickling jingle. And while it is true that scientists have any\nnumber of plausible and interesting explanations for this same\nfeeling, I am sorry to say I have forgotten them.\n\nI am compelled, then, to fall back upon those same unreliable,\nirresponsible rhymesters, and to insist with them that a maid waiting\nin the springtide for the man she loves is necessarily happy and very\nrarely puzzles her head over the scientific reason for it.\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nBut ten minutes later she saw Mr. Woods in the distance striding\nacross the sunlit terraces, and was seized with a conviction that\ntheir interview was likely to prove a stormy one. There was an ominous\nstiffness in his gait.\n\n\"Oh, dear, dear!\" Miss Hugonin wailed; \"he's in a temper now, and\nhe'll probably be just as disagreeable as it's possible for any one\nto be. I do wish men weren't so unreasonable! He looks exactly like a\nbig, blue-eyed thunder-cloud just now--just now, when I'm sure he has\nevery cause in the _world_ to be very much pleased--after all\nI've done for him. He makes me awfully tired. I think he's _very\nungrateful_. I--I think I'm rather afraid.\"\n\nIn fact, she was. Now that the meeting she had anticipated these\ntwelve hours past was actually at hand, there woke in her breast an\nunreasoning panic. Miss Hugonin considered, and caught up her skirts,\nand whisked into the summer-house, and there sat down in the darkest\ncorner and devoutly wished Mr. Woods in Crim Tartary, or Jericho, or,\nin a word, any region other than the gardens of Selwoode.\n\nBilly came presently to the opening in the hedge and stared at the\ndeserted bench. He was undeniably in a temper. But, then, how becoming\nit was! thought someone.\n\n\"Miss Hugonin!\" he said, coldly.\n\nEvidently (thought someone) he intends to be just as nasty as\npossible.\n\n\"Peggy!\" said Mr. Woods, after a little.\n\nPerhaps (thought someone) he won't be _very_ nasty.\n\n\"Dear Peggy!\" said Mr. Woods, in his most conciliatory tone.\n\nSomeone rearranged her hair complacently.\n\nBut there was no answer, save the irresponsible chattering of the\nbirds, and with a sigh Billy turned upon his heel.\n\nThen, by the oddest chance in the world, Margaret coughed.\n\nI dare say it was damp in the summer-house; or perhaps it was caused\nby some passing bronchial irritation; or perhaps, incredible as it may\nseem, she coughed to show him where she was. But I scarcely think so,\nbecause Margaret insisted afterward--very positively, too--that she\ndidn't cough at all.\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\"Well!\" Mr. Woods observed, lengthening the word somewhat.\n\nIn the intimate half-light of the summer-house, he loomed prodigiously\nbig. He was gazing downward in careful consideration of three fat\ntortoise-shell pins and a surprising quantity of gold hair, which was\npractically all that he could see of Miss Hugonin's person; for that\nyoung lady had suddenly become a limp mass of abashed violet ruffles,\nand had discovered new and irresistible attractions in the mosaics\nabout her feet.\n\nBilly's arms were crossed on his breast and his right hand caressed\nhis chin meditatively. By and bye, \"I wonder, now,\" he reflected,\naloud, \"if you can give any reason--any possible reason--why you\nshouldn't be locked up in the nearest sanatorium?\"\n\n\"You needn't be rude, you know,\" a voice observed from the\nneighbourhood of the ruffles, \"because there isn't anything you can do\nabout it.\"\n\nMr. Woods ventured a series of inarticulate observations. \"But why?\"\nhe concluded, desperately. \"But why, Peggy?--in Heaven's name, what's\nthe meaning of all this?\"\n\nShe looked up. Billy was aware of two large blue stars; his heart\nleapt; and then he recalled a pair of gray-green eyes that had\nregarded him in much the same fashion not long ago, and he groaned.\n\n\"I was unfair to you last night,\" she said, and the ring of her odd,\ndeep voice, and the richness and sweetness of it, moved him to faint\nlonging, to a sick heart-hunger. It was tremulous, too, and very\ntender. \"Yes, I was unutterably unfair, Billy. You asked me to marry\nyou when you thought I was a beggar, and--and Uncle Fred _ought_ to\nhave left you the money. It was on account of me that he didn't, you\nknow. I really owed it to you. And after the way I talked to you--so\nlong as I had the money--I--and, anyhow, its very disagreeable and\neccentric and _horrid_ of you to object to being rich!\" Margaret\nconcluded, somewhat incoherently.\n\nShe had not thought it would be like this. He seemed so stern.\n\nBut, \"Isn't that exactly like her?\" Mr. Woods was demanding of his\nsoul. \"She thinks she has been unfair to me--to me, whom she doesn't\ncare a button for, mind you. So she hands over a fortune to make up\nfor it, simply because that's the first means that comes to hand! Now,\nisn't that perfectly unreasonable, and fantastic, and magnificent, and\nincredible?--in short, isn't that Peggy all over? Why, God bless her,\nher heart's bigger than a barn-door! Oh, it's no wonder that fellow\nKennaston was grinning just now when he sent me to her! He can afford\nto grin.\"\n\nAloud, he stated, \"You're an angel, Peggy that's what you are. I've\nalways suspected it, and I'm glad to know it now for a fact. But in\nthis prosaic world not even angels are allowed to burn up wills for\nrecreation. Why, bless my soul, child, you--why, there's no telling\nwhat trouble you might have gotten into!\"\n\nMiss Hugonin pouted. \"You needn't be such a grandfather,\" she\nsuggested, helpfully.\n\n\"But it's a serious business,\" he insisted. At this point Billy began\nto object to her pouting as distracting one's mind from the subject\nunder discussion. \"It--why, it's----\"\n\n\"It's what?\" she pouted, even more rebelliously.\n\n\"Crimson,\" said Mr. Woods, considering--\"oh, the very deepest,\nduskiest crimson such as you can't get in tubes. It's a colour was\nnever mixed on any palette. It's--eh? Oh, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"I think you ought to,\" said Margaret, primly. Nevertheless, she had\nbrightened considerably.\n\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Woods continued with a fine colour, \"I can't take the\nmoney. That's absurd.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" she queried, idly. \"Now, I wonder how you're going to help\nyourself?\"\n\n\"Simplest thing in the world,\" he assured her. \"You see this match,\ndon't you, Peggy? Well, now you're going to give me that paper I see\nin that bag-thing at your waist, and I'm going to burn it till it's\nall nice, soft, feathery ashes that can't ever be probated. And then\nthe first will, which is practically the same as the last, will be\nallowed to stand, and I'll tell your father all about the affair,\nbecause he ought to know, and you'll have to settle with those\ncolleges. And in that way,\" Mr. Woods submitted, \"Uncle Fred's last\nwishes will be carried out just as he expressed them, and there\nneedn't be any trouble--none at all. So give me the will, Peggy?\"\n\nIt is curious what a trivial matter love makes of felony.\n\nMargaret's heart sank.\n\nHowever, \"Yes?\" said she, encouragingly; \"and what do you intend doing\nafterward?--\"\n\n\"I--I shall probably live abroad,\" said Billy. \"Cheaper, you know.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Miss Hugonin pouted. 'You needn't be such a\ngrandfather,' she suggested, helpfully\"]\n\nAnd here (he thought) was an excellent, an undreamed-of opportunity to\ninform her of his engagement. He had much better tell her now and have\ndone. Mr. Woods opened his mouth and looked at Margaret, and closed\nit. Again she was pouting in a fashion that distracted one's mind.\n\n\"That would be most unattractive,\" said Miss Hugonin, calmly. \"You're\nvery stupid, Billy, to think of living abroad. Billy, I think you're\nalmost as stupid as I am. I've been very stupid, Billy. I thought I\nliked Mr. Kennaston. I don't, Billy--not that way. I've just told him\nso. I'm not--I'm not engaged to anybody now, Billy. But wasn't it\nstupid of me to make such a mistake, Billy?\"\n\nThat was a very interesting mosaic there in the summer-house.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Mr. Woods. His voice shook, and his hands\nlifted a little toward her and trembled.\n\nPoor Billy dared not understand. Her eyes downcast, her foot tapping\nthe floor gently, Margaret was all one blush. She, too, was trembling\na little, and she was a little afraid and quite unutterably happy; and\noutwardly she was very much the tiny lady of Oberon's court, very much\nthe coquette quintessentialised.\n\nIt is pitiable that our proud Margaret should come to such a pass. Ah,\nthe men that you have flouted and scorned and bedeviled and mocked at,\nMargaret--could they see you now, I think the basest of them could\nnot but pity and worship you. This man is bound in honour to another\nwoman; yet a little, and his lips will open--very dry, parched lips\nthey are now--and he will tell you, and your pride will drive you mad,\nand your heart come near to breaking.\n\n\"Don't you understand--oh, you silly Billy!\" She was peeping at him\nmeltingly from under her lashes.\n\n\"I--I'm imagining vain things,\" said Mr. Woods. \"I--oh, Peggy, Peggy,\nI think I must be going mad!\"\n\nHe stared hungrily at the pink, startled face that lifted toward his.\nAh, no, no, it could not be possible, this thing he had imagined for a\nmoment. He had misunderstood.\n\nAnd now just for a little (thought poor Billy) let my eyes drink in\nthose dear felicities of colour and curve, and meet just for a little\nthe splendour of those eyes that have the April in them, and rest just\nfor a little upon that sanguine, close-grained, petulant mouth; and\nthen I will tell her, and then I think that I must die.\n\n\"Peggy----\" he began, in a flattish voice.\n\n\"They have evidently gone,\" said the voice of Mr. Kennaston; \"yes,\nthose beautiful, happy young people have foolishly deserted the very\nprettiest spot in the gardens. Let us sit here, Kathleen.\"\n\n\"But I'm not an eavesdropper,\" Mr. Woods protested, half angrily.\n\nI fear Margaret was not properly impressed.\n\n\"Please, Billy,\" she pleaded, in a shrill whisper, \"please let's\nlisten. He's going to propose to her now, and you've no idea how\nfunny he is when he proposes. Oh, don't be so pokey, Billy--do let's\nlisten!\"\n\nBut Mr. Woods had risen with a strange celerity and was about to leave\nthe summer-house.\n\nMargaret pouted. Mrs. Saumarez and Mr. Kennaston were seated not\ntwenty feet from the summer-house, on the bench which Miss Hugonin had\njust left. And when that unprincipled young woman finally rose to her\nfeet, it must be confessed that it was with a toss of the head and\nwith the reflection that while to listen wasn't honourable, it would\nat least be very amusing. I grieve to admit it, but with Billy's\nscruples she hadn't the slightest sympathy.\n\nThen Kennaston cried, suddenly: \"Why, you're mad, Kathleen! Woods\nwants to marry _you!_ Why, he's heels over head in love with Miss\nHugonin!\"\n\nMiss Hugonin turned to Mr. Woods with a little intake of the breath.\n\nNo, I shall not attempt to tell you what Billy saw in her countenance.\nTimanthes-like, I drape before it the vines of the summer-house. For\na brief space I think we had best betake ourselves outside,\nleaving Margaret in a very pitiable state of anger, and shame, and\nhumiliation, and heartbreak--leaving poor Billy with a heart that\nached, seeing the horror of him in her face.\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nMrs. Saumarez laughed bitterly.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"Billy cared for me, you know, a long time ago. And\nthis morning he told me he still cared. Billy doesn't pretend to be\na clever man, you see, and so he can afford to practice some of the\nbrute virtues, such as constancy and fidelity.\"\n\nThere was a challenging flame in her eyes, but Kennaston let the stab\npass unnoticed. To do him justice, he was thinking less of himself,\njust now, than of how this news would affect Margaret; and his face\nwas very grave and strangely tender, for in his own fashion he loved\nMargaret.\n\n\"It's nasty, very nasty,\" he said, at length, in a voice that was\npuzzled. \"Yet I could have sworn yesterday----\" Kennaston paused and\nlaughed lightly. \"She was an heiress yesterday, and to-day she is\nnobody. And Mr. Woods, being wealthy, can afford to gratify the\nvirtues you commend so highly and, with a fidelity that is most\nedifying, return again to his old love. And she welcomes him--and the\nWoods millions--with open arms. It is quite affecting, is it not,\nKathleen?\"\n\n\"You needn't be disagreeable,\" she observed.\n\n\"My dear Kathleen, I assure you I am not angry. I am merely a little\nsorry for human nature. I could have sworn Woods was honest. But\nrogues all, rogues all, Kathleen! Money rules us in the end; and now\nthe parable is fulfilled, and Love the prodigal returns to make merry\nover the calf of gold. Confess,\" Mr. Kennaston queried, with a smile,\n\"is it not strange an all-wise Creator should have been at pains to\nfashion this brave world about us for little men and women such as\nwe to lie and pilfer in? Was it worth while, think you, to arch the\nfirmament above our rogueries, and light the ageless stars as candles\nto display our antics? Let us be frank, Kathleen, and confess that\nlife is but a trivial farce ignobly played in a very stately temple.\"\nAnd Mr. Kennaston laughed again.\n\n\"Let us be frank!\" Kathleen cried, with a little catch in her voice.\n\"Why, it isn't in you to be frank, Felix Kennaston! Your life is\nnothing but a succession of poses--shallow, foolish poses meant\nto hoodwink the world and at times yourself. For you do hoodwink\nyourself, don't you, Felix?\" she asked, eagerly, and gave him no time\nto answer. She feared, you see, lest his answer might dilapidate the\none fortress she had been able to build about his honour.\n\n\"And now,\" she went on, quickly, \"you're trying to make me think you a\ndevil of a fellow, aren't you? And you're hinting that I've accepted\nBilly because of his money, aren't you? Well, it is true that I\nwouldn't marry him if he were poor. But he's very far from being poor.\nAnd he cares for me. And I am fond of him. And so I shall marry him\nand make him as good a wife as I can. So there!\"\n\nMrs. Saumarez faced him with an uneasy defiance. He was smiling oddly.\n\n\"I have heard it rumoured in many foolish tales and jingling verses,\"\nsaid Kennaston, after a little, \"that a thing called love exists in\nthe world. And I have also heard, Kathleen, that it sometimes enters\ninto the question of marriage. It appears that I was misinformed.\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, slowly, \"there is a thing called love. I think\nwomen are none the better for knowing it. To a woman, it means to take\nsome man--some utterly commonplace man, perhaps--perhaps, only an idle\n_poseur_ such as you are, Felix--and to set him up on a pedestal, and\nto bow down and worship him; and to protest loudly, both to the world\nand to herself, that in spite of all appearances her idol really\nhasn't feet of clay, or that, at any rate, it is the very nicest clay\nin the world. For a time she deceives herself, Felix. Then the idol\ntopples from the pedestal and is broken, and she sees that it is all\nclay, Felix--clay through and through--and her heart breaks with it.\"\n\nKennaston bowed his head. \"It is true,\" said he; \"that is the love of\nwomen.\"\n\n\"To a man,\" she went on, dully, \"it means to take some woman--the\nnearest woman who isn't actually deformed--and to make pretty speeches\nto her and to make her love him. And after a while--\" Kathleen\nshrugged her shoulders drearily. \"Why, after a while,\" said she, \"he\ngrows tired and looks for some other woman.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Kennaston--\"yes, very true that some men love in\nthat fashion.\"\n\nThere ensued a silence. It was a long silence, and under the tension\nof it Kathleen's composure snapped like a cord that has been stretched\nto the breaking point.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" she cried, suddenly; \"that is how I have loved you\nand that is how you've loved me, Felix Kennaston! Ah, Billy told me\nwhat happened last night! And that--that was why I--\" Mrs. Saumarez\npaused and regarded him curiously. \"You don't make a very noble\nfigure, just now, do you?\" she asked, with careful deliberation. \"You\nwere ready to sell yourself for Miss Hugonin's money, weren't you? And\nnow you must take her without the money. Poor Felix! Ah, you poor,\npetty liar, who've over-reached yourself so utterly!\" And again\nKathleen began to laugh, but somewhat shrilly, somewhat hysterically.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" he said, with a flush. \"It is true that I asked Miss\nHugonin to marry me. But she--very wisely, I dare say--declined.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Kathleen said, slowly. Then--and it will not do to inquire too\nclosely into her logic--she spoke with considerable sharpness: \"She's\na conceited little cat! I never in all my life knew a girl to be quite\nso conceited as she is. Positively, I don't believe she thinks there's\na man breathing who's good enough for her!\"\n\nKennaston grinned. \"Oh, Kathleen, Kathleen!\" he said; \"you are simply\ndelicious.\"\n\nAnd Mrs. Saumarez coloured prettily and tried to look severe and\ncould not, for the simple reason that, while she knew Kennaston to be\nflippant and weak and unstable as water and generally worthless, yet\nfor some occult cause she loved him as tenderly as though he had been\na paragon of all the manly virtues. And I dare say that for many of us\nit is by a very kindly provision of Nature that all women are created\ncapable of doing this illogical thing and that most of them do it\ndaily.\n\n\"It is true,\" the poet said, at length, \"that I have played no heroic\npart. And I don't question, Kathleen, that I am all you think me. Yet,\nsuch as I am, I love you. And such as I am, you love me, and it is I\nthat you are going to marry, and not that Woods person.\"\n\n\"He's worth ten of you!\" she cried, scornfully.\n\n\"Twenty of me, perhaps,\" Mr. Kennaston assented, \"but that isn't the\nquestion. You don't love him, Kathleen. You are about to marry him for\nhis money. You are about to do what I thought to do yesterday. But you\nwon't, Kathleen. You know that I need you, my dear, and--unreasonably\nenough, God knows--you love me.\"\n\nMrs. Saumarez regarded him intently for a considerable space, and\nduring that space the Eagle warred in her heart with the one foe\nhe can never conquer. Love had a worthless ally; but Love fought\nstaunchly.\n\nBy and bye, \"Yes,\" she said, and her voice was almost sullen; \"I love\nyou. I ought to love Billy, but I don't. I shall ask him to release me\nfrom my engagement. And yes, I will marry you if you like.\"\n\nHe raised her hand to his lips. \"You are an angel,\" Mr. Kennaston was\npleased to say.\n\n\"No,\" Mrs. Saumarez dissented, rather forlornly; \"I'm simply a fool.\nOtherwise, I wouldn't be about to marry you, knowing you as I do for\nwhat you are--knowing that I haven't one chance in a hundred of any\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, and his voice was earnest, \"you know at least that\nwhat there is of good in me is at its best with you.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" Kathleen cried, quickly. \"That is so, isn't it, Felix?\nAnd you do care for me, don't you? Felix, are you sure you care for\nme--quite sure? And are you quite certain, Felix, that you never cared\nso much for any one else?\"\n\nMr. Kennaston was quite certain. He proceeded to explain his feelings\ntoward her at some length.\n\nKathleen listened with downcast eyes and almost cheated herself into\nthe belief that the man she loved was all that he should be. But at\nthe bottom of her heart she knew he wasn't.\n\nI think we may fairly pity her.\n\nKennaston and Mrs. Saumarez chatted very amicably for some ten\nminutes. At the end of that period, the twelve forty-five express\nbellowing faintly in the distance recalled the fact that the morning\nmail was in, and thereupon, in the very best of humours, they set\nout for the house. I grieve to admit it, but Kathleen had utterly\nforgotten Billy by this, and was no more thinking of him than she was\nof the Man in the Iron Mask.\n\nShe was with Kennaston, you see; and her thoughts, and glances, and\nlips, and adoration were all given to his pleasuring, just as her life\nwould have been if its loss could have saved him from a toothache. He\nstrutted a little, and was a little grateful to her, and--to do\nhim justice--received the tribute she accorded him with perfect\nsatisfaction and equanimity.\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nMargaret came out of the summer-house, Billy Woods followed her, in a\nvery moist state of perturbation.\n\n\"Peggy----\" said Mr. Woods.\n\nBut Miss Hugonin was laughing. Clear as a bird-call, she poured forth\nher rippling mimicry of mirth. They train women well in these matters.\nTo Margaret, just now, her heart seemed dead within her. Her lover was\nproved unworthy. Her pride was shattered. She had loved this clumsy\nliar yonder, had given up a fortune for him, dared all for him, had\n(as the phrase runs) flung herself at his head. The shame of it was a\nphysical sickness, a nausea. But now, in this jumble of miseries, in\nthis breaking-up of the earth and the void heavens that surged about\nher and would not be mastered, the girl laughed; and her laughter was\ncare-free and half-languid like that of a child who is thinking of\nsomething else. Ah, yes, they train women well in these matters.\n\nAt length Margaret said, in high, crisp accents: \"Pardon me, but I\ncan't help being amused, Mr. Woods, by the way in which hard luck\ndogs your footsteps. I think Fate must have some grudge against you,\nMr. Woods.\"\n\n\"Peggy----\" said Mr. Woods.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" she interrupted him, her masculine little chin high in\nthe air, \"but I wish you wouldn't call me that. It was well enough\nwhen we were boy and girl together, Mr. Woods. But you've developed\nsince--ah, yes, you've developed into such a splendid actor, such a\nconsummate liar, such a clever scoundrel, Mr. Woods, that I scarcely\nrecognise you now.\"\n\nAnd there was not a spark of anger in the very darkest corner of\nBilly's big, brave heart, but only pity--pity all through and through,\nthat sent little icy ticklings up and down his spine and turned his\nbreathing to great sobs. For she had turned full face to him and he\ncould see the look in her eyes.\n\nI think he has never forgotten it. Years after the memory of it would\ncome upon him suddenly and set hot drenching waves of shame and\nremorse surging about his body--remorse unutterable that he ever hurt\nhis Peggy so deeply. For they were tragic eyes. Beneath them her\ntwitching mouth smiled bravely, but the mirth of her eyes was\nmonstrous. It was the mirth of a beaten woman, of a woman who has\nknown the last extreme of shame and misery and has learned to laugh at\nit. Even now Billy Woods cannot quite forget.\n\n\"Peggy,\" said he, brokenly, \"ah, dear, dear Peggy, listen to me!\"\n\n\"Why, have you thought of a plausible lie so soon?\" she queried,\nsweetly. \"Dear me, Mr. Woods, what is the use of explaining things? It\nis very simple. You wanted to marry me last night because I was rich.\nAnd when I declined the honour, you went back to your old love. Oh,\nit's very simple, Mr. Woods! It's a pity, though--isn't it?--that all\nyour promptness went for nothing. Why, dear me, you actually managed\nto propose before breakfast, didn't you? I should have thought that\nsuch eagerness would have made an impression on Kathleen--oh, a most\nfavourable impression. Too bad it hasn't!\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said Billy. \"Ah, you're forcing me to talk like a cad,\nPeggy, but I can't see you suffer--I can't! Kathleen misunderstood\nwhat I said to her. I--I didn't mean to propose to her, Peggy. It was\na mistake, I tell you. It's you I love--just you. And when I asked you\nto marry me last night--why, I thought the money was mine, Peggy.\nI'd never have asked you if I hadn't thought that. I--ah, you don't\nbelieve me, you don't believe me, Peggy, and before God, I'm telling\nyou the simple truth! Why, I hadn't ever seen that last will, Peggy!\nIt was locked up in that centre place in the desk, you remember.\nWhy--why, you yourself had the keys to it, Peggy. Surely, you\nremember, dear?\" And Billy's voice shook and skipped whole octaves as\nhe pleaded with her, for he knew she did not believe him and he could\nnot endure the horror of her eyes.\n\nBut Margaret shook her head; and as aforetime the twitching lips\ncontinued to laugh beneath those tragic eyes. Ah, poor little lady of\nElfland! poor little Undine, with a soul wakened to suffering!\n\n\"Clumsy, very clumsy!\" she rebuked him. \"I see that you are accustomed\nto prepare your lies in advance, Mr. Woods. As an extemporaneous liar\nyou are very clumsy. Men don't propose by mistake except in farces.\nAnd while we are speaking of farces, don't you think it time to drop\nthat one of your not knowing about that last will?\"\n\n\"The farce!\" Billy stammered. \"You--why, you saw me when I found it!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I saw you when you pretended to find it. I saw you when you\npretended to unlock that centre place. But now, of course, I know it\nnever was locked. I'm very careless about locking things, Mr. Woods.\nAh, yes, that gave you a beautiful opportunity, didn't it? So, when\nyou were rummaging through my desk--without my permission, by the way,\nbut that's a detail--you found both wills and concocted your little\ncomedy? That was very clever. Oh, you think you're awfully smooth,\ndon't you, Billy Woods? But if you had been a bit more daring, don't\nyou see, you could have suppressed the last one and taken the money\nwithout being encumbered by me? That was rather clumsy of you, wasn't\nit?\" Suave, gentle, sweet as honey was the speech of Margaret as she\nlifted her face to his, but her eyes were tragedies.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Billy. \"Ah--yes--you think--that.\" He was very careful in\narticulating his words, was Billy, and afterward he nodded his head\ngravely. The universe had somehow suffered an airy dissolution like\nthat of Prospero's masque--Selwoode and its gardens, the great globe\nitself, \"the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn\ntemples\" were all as vanished wraiths. There was only Peggy left--\nPeggy with that unimaginable misery in her eyes that he must drive\naway somehow. If that was what she thought, there was no way for him\nto prove it wasn't so.\n\n\"Why, dear me, Mr. Woods,\" she retorted, carelessly, \"what else could\nI think?\"\n\nHere Mr. Woods blundered.\n\n\"Ah, think what you will, Peggy!\" he cried, his big voice cracking and\nsobbing and resonant with pain. \"Ah, my dear, think what you will, but\ndon't grieve for it, Peggy! Why, if I'm all you say I am, that's no\nreason you should suffer for it! Ah, don't, Peggy! In God's name,\ndon't! I can't bear it, dear,\" he pleaded with her, helplessly.\n\nBilly was suffering, too. But her sorrow was the chief of his, and\nwhat stung him now to impotent anger was that she must suffer and he\nbe unable to help her--for, ah, how willingly, how gladly, he would\nhave borne all poor Peggy's woes upon his own broad shoulders.\n\nBut none the less, he had lost an invaluable opportunity to hold his\ntongue.\n\n\"Suffer! I suffer!\" she mocked him, languidly; and then, like a\nbanjo-string, the tension snapped, and she gave a long, angry gasp,\nand her wrath flamed.\n\n\"Upon my word, you're the most conceited man I ever knew in my life!\nYou think I'm in love with you! With you! Billy Woods, I wouldn't wipe\nmy feet on you if you were the last man left on earth! I hate you, I\nloathe you, I detest you, I despise you! Do you hear me?--I hate you.\nWhat do I care if you _are_ a snob, and a cad, and a fortune-hunter,\nand a forger, and--well, I don't care! Perhaps you haven't ever\nforged anything yet, but I'm quite sure you would if you ever got an\nopportunity. You'd be delighted to do it. Yes, you would--you're just\nthe sort of man who _revels_ in crime. I love you! Why, that's the\nbest joke I've heard for a long time. I'm only sorry for you, Billy\nWoods--_sorry_ because Kathleen has thrown you over--sorry, do you\nunderstand? Yes, since you're so fond of skinny women, I think it's a\ngreat pity she wouldn't have you. Don't talk to me!--she _is_ skinny.\nI guess I know. She's as skinny as a beanpole. She's skinnier than I\never imagined it possible for anybody--_anybody_--to be. And she\npads and rouges till I think it's disgusting, and not half--not\n_one-half_--of her hair belongs to her, and that half is dyed. But,\nof course, if you like that sort of thing, there's no accounting for\ntastes, and I'm sure I'm very sorry for you, even though personally I\n_don't_ care for skinny women. I hate 'em! And I hate you, too, Billy\nWoods!\"\n\nShe stamped her foot, did Margaret. You must bear with her, for her\nheart is breaking now, and if she has become a termagant it is because\nher shamed pride has driven her mad. Bear with her, then, a little\nlonger.\n\nBilly tried to bear with her, for in part he understood.\n\n\"Peggy,\" said he, very gently, \"you're wrong.\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say!\" she snapped at him.\n\n\"We won't discuss Kathleen, if you please. But you're wrong about the\nwill. I've told you the whole truth about that, but I don't blame you\nfor not believing me, Peggy--ah, no, not I. There seems to be a curse\nupon Uncle Fred's money. It brings out the worst of all of us. It has\nchanged even you, Peggy--and not for the better, Peggy. You've become\ndistrustful. You--ah, well, we won't discuss that now. Give me the\nwill, my dear, and I'll burn it before your eyes. That ought to show\nyou, Peggy, that you're wrong.\" Billy was very white-lipped as he\nended, for the Woods temper is a short one.\n\nBut she had an arrow left for him. \"Give it to you! And do you think\nI'd trust you with it, Billy Woods?\"\n\n\"Peggy!--ah, Peggy, I hadn't deserved that. Be just, at least, to me,\"\npoor Billy begged of her.\n\nWhich was an absurd thing to ask of an angry woman.\n\n\"Yes, I _do_ know what you'd do with it! You'd take it right off and\nhave it probated or executed or whatever it is they do to wills, and\nturn me straight out in the gutter. That's just what you're _longing_\nto do this very moment. Oh, I know, Billy Woods--I know what a temper\nyou've got, and I know you're keeping quiet now simply because you\nknow that's the most exasperating thing you can possibly do. I\nwouldn't have such a disposition as you've got for the world. You've\nabsolutely _no_ control over your temper--not a bit of it. You're\n_vile_, Billy Woods! Oh, I _hate_ you! Yes, you've made me cry, and I\nsuppose you're very proud of yourself. _Aren't_ you proud? Don't stand\nstaring at me like a stuck pig, but answer me when I talk to you!\nAren't you _proud_ of making me cry? Aren't you? Ah, don't talk to\nme--don't talk to _me_, I tell you! I don't wish to hear a word you've\ngot to say. I _hate_ you. And you shan't have the money, that's flat.\"\n\n\"I don't want it,\" said Billy. \"I've been trying to tell you for the\nlast, half-hour I don't want it. In God's name, why can't you talk\nlike a sensible woman, Peggy?\" I am afraid that Mr. Woods, too, was\nbeginning to lose his temper.\n\n\"That's right--swear at me! It only needed that. You do want the\nmoney, and when you say you don't you're lying--lying--_lying_, do you\nunderstand? You all want my money. Oh, dear, _dear!_\" Margaret wailed,\nand her great voice was shaken to its depths and its sobbing was the\nlong, hopeless sobbing of a violin, as she flung back her tear-stained\nface, and clenched her little hands tight at her sides; \"why _can't_\nyou let me alone? You're all after my money--you, and Mr. Kennaston,\nand Mr. Jukesbury, and all of you! Why _can't_ you let me alone? Ever\nsince I've had it you've hunted me as if I'd been a wild beast. God\nhelp me, I haven't had a moment's peace, a moment's rest, a, moment's\nquiet, since Uncle Fred died. They all want my money--everybody wants\nmy money! Oh, Billy, Billy, why _can't_ they let me alone?\"\n\n\"Peggy----\" said he.\n\nBut she interrupted him. \"Don't talk to _me_, Billy Woods! Don't you\n_dare_ talk to me. I told you I didn't wish to hear a word you had to\nsay, didn't I? Yes, you all want my money. And you shan't have it.\nIt's mine. Uncle Fred left it to me. It's mine, I tell you. I've got\nthe greatest thing in the world--money! And I'll keep it. Ah, I hate\nyou all--every one of you--but I'll make you cringe to me. I'll make\nyou _all_ cringe, do you hear, because I've got the money you're ready\nto sell your paltry souls for! Oh, I'll make you cringe most of all,\nBilly Woods! I'm rich, do you hear?--rich--_rich_! Wouldn't you be\nglad to marry the rich Margaret Hugonin, Billy? Ah, haven't you\nschemed hard for that? You'd be glad to do it, wouldn't you? You'd\ngive your dirty little soul for that, wouldn't you, Billy? Ah, what a\ncur you are! Well, some day perhaps I'll buy you just as I would any\nother cur. Wouldn't you be glad if I did, Billy? Beg for it, Billy!\nBeg, sir! Beg!\" And Margaret flung back her head again, and laughed\nshrilly, and held up her hand before him as one holds a lump of sugar\nbefore a pug-dog.\n\nIn Selwoode I can fancy how the Eagle screamed his triumph.\n\nBut Billy's face was ashen.\n\n\"Before God!\" he said, between his teeth, \"loving you as I do, I\nwouldn't marry you now for all the wealth in the world! The money has\nruined you--ruined you, Peggy.\"\n\nFor a little she stared at him. By and bye, \"I dare say it has,\" she\nsaid, in a strangely sober tone. \"I've been scolding like a fishwife.\nI beg your pardon, Mr. Woods--not for what I've said, because I meant\nevery _word_ of it, but I beg your pardon for saying it. Don't come\nwith me, please.\"\n\nBlindly she turned from him. Her shoulders had the droop of an old\nwoman's. Margaret was wearied now, weary with the weariness of death.\n\nFor a while Mr. Woods stared after the tired little figure that\ntrudged straight onward in the sunlight, stumbling as she went. Then a\npleached walk swallowed her, and Mr. Woods groaned.\n\n\"Oh, Peggy, Peggy!\" he said, in bottomless compassion; \"oh, my poor\nlittle Peggy! How changed you are!\"\n\nAfterward Mr. Woods sank down upon the bench and buried his face in\nhis hands. He sat there for a long time. I don't believe he thought\nof anything very clearly. His mind was a turgid chaos of misery; and\nabout him the birds shrilled and quavered and carolled till the air\nwas vibrant with their trilling. One might have thought they choired\nin honour of the Eagle's triumph, in mockery of poor Billy.\n\nThen Mr. Woods raised his head with a queer, alert look. Surely he had\nheard a voice--the dearest of all voices.\n\n\"Billy!\" it wailed; \"oh, Billy, _Billy_!\"\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nFor at the height of this particularly mischancy posture of affairs\nthe meddlesome Fates had elected to dispatch Cock-eye Flinks to serve\nas our _deus ex machina_. And just as in the comedy the police turn\nup in the nick of time to fetch Tartuffe to prison, or in the tragedy\nFriar John manages to be detained on his journey to Mantua and thus\nbring about that lamentable business in the tomb of the Capulets, so\nMr. Flinks now happens inopportunely to arrive upon our lesser stage.\n\nFaithfully to narrate how Cock-eye Flinks chanced to be at Selwoode\nwere a task of magnitude. That gentleman travelled very quietly; and\nfor the most part, he journeyed incognito under a variety of aliases\nsuggested partly by a fertile imagination and in part by prudential\nmotives. For his notions of proprietary rights were deplorably vague,\nand his acquaintance with the police, in consequence, extensive. And\nfinally, that he was now at Selwoode was not in the least his fault,\nbut all the doing of an N. & O. brakesman, who had in uncultured\nargument, reinforced by a coupling-pin, persuaded Mr. Flinks to\ndisembark from the northern freight on the night previous.\n\nMr. Flinks, then, sat leaning against a tree in the gardens of\nSelwoode, some thirty feet from the wall that stands between Selwoode\nand Gridlington, and nursed his pride and foot, both injured in that\nhigh debate of last evening, and with a jackknife rounded off the top\nof a substantial staff designed to alleviate his present lameness.\nMeanwhile, he tempered his solitude with music, whistling melodiously\nthe air of a song that pertained to the sacredness of home and of a\nwhite-haired mother.\n\nSubsequently to Cock-eye Flinks (as the playbill has it), enter a\nvision in violet ruffles.\n\nWide-eyed, she came upon him in her misery, steadily trudging toward\nan unknown goal. I think he startled her a bit. Indeed, it must be\nadmitted that Mr. Flinks, while a man of undoubted talent in his\nparticular line of business, was, like many of your great geniuses, in\noutward aspect unprepossessing and misleading; for whereas he looked\nlike a very shiftless and very dirty tramp, he was as a matter of fact\nas vile a rascal as ever pawned a swinish soul for whiskey.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" said Margaret, sharply. \"Don't you know\nthis is private property?\"\n\nTo his feet rose Cock-eye Flinks. \"Lady,\" said he, with humbleness,\n\"you wouldn't be hard on a poor workingman, would you? It ain't my\nfault I'm here, lady--at least, it ain't rightly my fault. I just\nclimbed over the wall to rest a minute--just a minute, lady, in the\nshade of these beautiful trees. I ain't a-hurting nobody by that,\nlady, I hope.\"\n\n\"Well, you had no business to do it,\" Miss Hugonin pointed out, \"and\nyou can just climb right back.\" Then she regarded him more intently,\nand her face softened somewhat. \"What's the matter with your foot?\"\nshe demanded.\n\n\"Brakesman,\" said Mr. Flinks, briefly. \"Threw me off a train. He\nstruck me cruel hard, he did, and me a poor workingman trying to make\nmy way to New York, lady, where my poor old mother's dying, lady, and\nme out of a job. Ah, it's a hard, hard world, lady--and me her only\nson--and he struck me cruel, cruel hard, he did, but I forgive him for\nit, lady. Ah, lady, you're so beautiful I know you're got a kind, good\nheart, lady. Can't you do something for a poor workingman, lady, with\na poor dying mother--and a poor, sick wife,\" Mr. Flinks added as a\ndolorous afterthought; and drew nearer to her and held out one hand\nappealingly.\n\nPetheridge Jukesbury had at divers times pointed out to her the evils\nof promiscuous charity, and these dicta Margaret parroted glibly\nenough, to do her justice, so long as there was no immediate question\nof dispensing alms. But for all that the next whining beggar would\nmove her tender heart, his glib inventions playing upon it like a\nfiddle, and she would give as recklessly as though there were no\nsuch things in the whole wide world as soup-kitchens and organised\ncharities and common-sense. \"Because, you know,\" she would afterward\nsalve her conscience, \"I _couldn't_ be sure he didn't need it, whereas\nI was _quite_ sure I didn't.\"\n\nNow she wavered for a moment. \"You didn't say you had a wife before,\"\nshe suggested.\n\n\"An invalid,\" sighed Mr. Flinks--\"a helpless invalid, lady. And six\nsmall children probably crying for bread at this very moment. Ah,\nlady, think what my feelings must be to hear 'em cry in vain--think\nwhat I must suffer to know that I summoned them cherubs out of Heaven\ninto this here hard, hard world, lady, and now can't do by 'em\nproperly!\" And Cock-eye Flinks brushed away a tear which I, for one,\nam inclined to regard as a particularly ambitious flight of his\nimagination.\n\nPromptly Margaret opened the bag at her waist and took out her purse.\n\"Don't!\" she pleaded. \"Please don't! I--I'm upset already. Take this,\nand please--oh, _please_, don't spend it in getting drunk or gambling\nor anything horrid,\" Miss Hugonin implored him. \"You all do, and it's\nso selfish of you and so discouraging.\"\n\nMr. Flinks eyed the purse hungrily. Such a fat purse! thought Cock-eye\nPlinks. And there ain't nobody within a mile of here, neither. You are\nnot to imagine that Mr. Flinks was totally abandoned; his vices were\nparochial, restrained for the most part by a lively apprehension of\nthe law. But now the spell of the Eagle was strong upon him.\n\n\"Lady,\" said Mr. Flinks, twisting in his grimy hand the bill she had\ngiven him--and there, too, the Eagle flaunted in his vigour and\nheartened him, \"lady, that ain't much for you to give. Can't you do a\nlittle better than that by a poor workingman, lady?\"\n\nA very unpleasant-looking person, Mr. Cock-eye Flinks. Oh, a\npeculiarly unpleasant-looking person to be a model son and a loving\nhusband and a tender father. Margaret was filled with a vague alarm.\n\nBut she was brave, was Margaret. \"No,\" said she, very decidedly, \"I\nshan't give you another cent. So you climb right over that wall and go\nstraight back where you belong.\"\n\nThe methods of Mr. Flinks, I regret to say, were somewhat more crude\nthan those of Mesdames Haggage and Saumarez and Messieurs Kennaston\nand Jukesbury.\n\n\"Cheese it!\" said Mr. Flinks, and flung away his staff and drew very\nnear to her. \"Gimme that money, do you hear!\"\n\n\"Don't you dare touch me!\" she panted; \"ah, don't you _dare_!\"\n\n\"Aw, hell!\" said Mr. Flinks, disgustedly, and his dirty hands were\nupon her, and his foul breath reeked in her face.\n\nIn her hour of need Margaret's heart spoke.\n\n\"Billy!\" she wailed; \"oh, Billy, _Billy_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe came to her--just as he would have scaled Heaven to come to her,\njust as he would have come to her in the nethermost pit of Hell if she\nhad called. Ah, yes, Billy Woods came to her now in her peril, and\nI don't think that Mr. Flinks particularly relished the look upon\nBilly's face as he ran through the gardens, for Billy was furiously\nmoved.\n\nCock-eye Flinks glanced back at the wall behind him. Ten feet high,\nand the fellow ain't far off. Cock-eye Flinks caught up his staff, and\nas Billy closed upon him, struck him full on the head. Again and again\nhe struck him. It was a sickening business.\n\nBilly had stopped short. For an instant he stood swaying on his feet,\na puzzled face showing under the trickling blood. Then he flung out\nhis hands a little, and they flapped loosely at the wrists, like\nwet clothes hung in the wind to dry, and Billy seemed to crumple up\nsuddenly, and slid down upon the grass in an untidy heap.\n\n\"Ah-h-h!\" said Mr. Flinks. He drew back and stared stupidly at that\nsprawling flesh which just now had been a man, and was seized with\nuncontrollable shuddering. \"Ah-h-h!\" said Mr. Flinks, very quietly.\n\nAnd Margaret went mad. The earth and the sky dissolved in many\nfloating specks and then went red--red like that heap yonder. The\nveneer of civilisation peeled, fell from her like snow from a shaken\ngarment. The primal beast woke and flicked aside the centuries' work.\nShe was the Cave-woman who had seen the death of her mate--the brute\nwho had been robbed of her mate.\n\n\"Damn you! _Damn_ you!\" she screamed, her voice high, flat, quite\nunhuman; \"ah, God in Heaven damn you!\" With inarticulate bestial cries\nshe fell upon the man who had killed Billy, and her violet fripperies\nfluttered, her impotent little hands beat at him, tore at him. She was\nfearless, shameless, insane. She only knew that Billy was dead.\n\nWith an oath the man flung her from him and turned on his heel. She\nfell to coaxing the heap in the grass to tell her that he forgave\nher--to open his eyes--to stop bloodying her dress--to come to\nluncheon...\n\nA fly settled on Billy's face and came in his zig-zag course to the\nred stream trickling from his nostrils, and stopped short. She brushed\nthe carrion thing away, but it crawled back drunkenly. She touched it\nwith her finger, and the fly would not move. On a sudden, every nerve\nin her body began to shake and jerk like a flag snapping in the wind.\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nSome ten minutes afterward, as the members of the house-party sat\nchatting on the terrace before Selwoode, there came among them a mad\nwoman in violet trappings that were splotched with blood.\n\n\"Did you know that Billy was dead?\" she queried, smilingly. \"Oh, yes,\na man killed Billy just now. Wasn't it too bad? Billy was such a nice\nboy, you know. I--I think it's very sad. I think it's the saddest\nthing I ever knew of in my life.\"\n\nKathleen Saumarez was the first to reach her. But she drew back\nquickly.\n\n\"No, ah, no!\" she said, with a little shudder. \"You didn't love Billy.\nHe loved you, and you didn't love him. Oh, Kathleen, Kathleen, how\n_could_ you help loving Billy? He was such a nice boy. I--I'm rather\nsorry he's dead.\"\n\nThen she stood silent, picking at her dress thoughtfully and still\nsmiling. Afterward, for the first and only time in history, Miss\nHugonin fainted--fainted with an anxious smile.\n\nPetheridge Jukesbury caught her as she fell, and began to blubber like\na whipped schoolboy as he stood there holding her in his arms.\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nBut Billy was not dead. There was still a feeble, jerky fluttering in\nhis big chest when Colonel Hugonin found him. His heart still moved,\nbut under the Colonel's hand its stirrings were vague and aimless as\nthose of a captive butterfly.\n\nThe Colonel had seen dead men and dying men before this; and as he\nbent over the boy he loved he gave a convulsive sob, and afterward\nburied his face in his hands.\n\nThen--of all unlikely persons in the world--it was Petheridge\nJukesbury who rose to meet the occasion.\n\nHis suavity and blandness forgotten in the presence of death, he\nmounted with confident alacrity to heights of greatness. Masterfully,\nhe overrode them all. He poured brandy between Billy's teeth. Then he\nordered the ladies off to bed, and recommended to Mr. Kennaston--when\nthat gentleman spoke of a clergyman--a far more startling destination.\n\nFor, \"It is far from my intention,\" said Mr.\n\nJukesbury, \"to appear lacking in respect to the cloth, but--er--just\nat present I am inclined to think we are in somewhat greater need of a\nmattress and a doctor and--ah--the exercise of a little common-sense.\nThe gentleman is--er--let us hope, in no immediate danger.\"\n\n\"How dare you suggest such a thing, sir?\" thundered Petheridge\nJukesbury. \"Didn't you see that poor girl's face? I tell you I'll be\ndamned if he dies, sir!\"\n\nAnd I fancy the recording angel heard him, and against a list of wordy\ncheats registered that oath to his credit.\n\nIt was Petheridge Jukesbury, then, who stalked into Mrs. Haggage's\napartments and appropriated her mattress as the first at hand, and\nafterward waddled through the gardens bearing it on his fat shoulders,\nand still later lifted Billy upon it as gently as a woman could have.\nBut it was the hatless Colonel on his favourite Black Bess (\"Damn your\nmotor-cars!\" the Colonel was wont to say; \"I consider my appearance\nsufficiently unprepossessing already, sir, without my arriving in\nHeaven in fragments and stinking of gasoline!\") who in Fairhaven town,\nsome quarter of an hour afterward, leaped Dr. Jeal's garden fence, and\nsubsequently bundled the doctor into his gig; and again yet later it\nwas the Colonel who stood fuming upon the terrace with Dr. Jeal on his\nway to Selwoode indeed, but still some four miles from the mansion\ntoward which he was urging his staid horse at its liveliest gait.\n\nKennaston tried to soothe him. But the Colonel clamoured to the\nheavens. Kennaston he qualified in various ways. And as for Dr. Jeal,\nhe would hold him responsible--\"personally, sir\"--for the consequences\nof his dawdling in this fashion--\"Damme, sir, like a damn' snail with\na wooden leg!\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said Kennaston, gravely, \"that the doctor will be of\nvery little use when he does arrive.\"\n\nThere was that in his face which made the Colonel pause in his\nobjurgations.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Colonel, \"what--do--you--mean?\" He found articulation\nsomewhat difficult.\n\n\"In your absence,\" Kennaston answered, \"Mr. Jukesbury, who it\nappears knows something of medicine, has subjected Mr. Woods to an\nexamination. It--it would be unkind to deceive you----\"\n\n\"Come to the point, sir,\" the Colonel interrupted him. \"What--do\nyou--mean?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Felix Kennaston, sadly, \"that--he is afraid--Mr. Woods\nwill never recover consciousness.\"\n\nColonel Hugonin stared at him. The skin of his flabby, wrinkled old\nthroat was working convulsively.\n\nThen, \"You're wrong, sir,\" the Colonel said. \"Billy _shan't_ die. Damn\nJukesbury! Damn all doctors, too, sir! I put my trust in my God, sir,\nand not in a box of damn' sugar-pills, sir. And I tell you, sir, _that\nboy is not going to die_.\"\n\nAfterward he turned and went into Selwoode defiantly.\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nIn the living-hall the Colonel found Margaret, white as paper, with\npurple lips that timidly smiled at him.\n\n\"Why ain't you in bed?\" the old gentleman demanded, with as great an\naffectation of sternness as he could muster. To say the truth, it was\nnot much; for Colonel Hugonin, for all his blustering optimism, was\nsadly shaken now.\n\n\"Attractive,\" said Margaret, \"I was, but I couldn't stay there. My--my\nbrain won't stop working, you see,\" she complained, wearily. \"There's\na thin little whisper in the back of it that keeps telling me about\nBilly, and what a liar he is, and what nice eyes he has, and how\npoor Billy is dead. It keeps telling me that, over and over again,\nattractive. It's such a tiresome, silly little whisper. But he is\ndead, isn't he? Didn't Mr. Kennaston tell me just now that he was\ndead?--or was it the whisper, attractive?\"\n\nThe Colonel coughed. \"Kennaston--er--Kennaston's a fool,\" he declared,\nhelplessly. \"Always said he was a fool. We'll have Jeal in presently.\"\n\n\"No--I remember now--Mr. Kennaston said Billy would die very soon. You\ndon't like people to disagree with you, do you, attractive? Of course,\nhe will die, for the man hit him very, _very_ hard. I'm sorry Billy is\ngoing to die, though, even if he is such a liar!\"\n\n\"Don't!\" said the Colonel, hoarsely; \"don't, daughter! I don't know\nwhat there is between you and Billy, but you're wrong. Oh, you're very\nhopelessly wrong! Billy's the finest boy I know.\"\n\nMargaret shook her head in dissent.\n\n\"No, he's a very contemptible liar,\" she said, disinterestedly, \"and\nthat is what makes it so queer that I should care for him more than I\ndo for anything else in the world. Yes, it's very queer.\"\n\nThen Margaret went into the room opening into the living-hall, where\nBilly Woods lay unconscious, pallid, breathing stertorously. And the\nColonel stared after her.\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" groaned the poor Colonel; \"why couldn't it have\nbeen I? Why couldn't it have been I that ain't wanted any longer?\nShe'd never have grieved like that for me!\"\n\nAnd indeed, I don't think she would have.\n\nFor to Margaret there had come, as, God willing, there comes to every\nclean-souled woman, the time to put away all childish things, and all\nchildish memories, and all childish ties, if need be, to follow one\nman only, and cleave to him, and know his life and hers to be knit up\ntogether, past severance, in a love that death itself may not affright\nnor slay.\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\nShe sat silent in one corner of the darkened room. It was the bedroom\nthat Frederick R. Woods formerly occupied--on the ground floor of\nSelwoode, opening into the living-hall--to which they had carried\nBilly.\n\nJukesbury had done what he could. In the bed lay Billy Woods, swathed\nin hot blankets, with bottles of hot water set to his feet. Jukesbury\nhad washed his face clean of that awful red, and had wrapped bandages\nof cracked ice about his head and propped it high with pillows. It\nwas little short of marvellous to see the pursy old hypocrite going\ncat-footed about the room on his stealthy ministrations, replenishing\nthe bandages, forcing spirits of ammonia between Billy's teeth,\nfighting deftly and confidently with death.\n\nBilly still breathed.\n\nThe Colonel came and went uneasily. The clock on the mantel ticked.\nMargaret brooded in a silence that was only accentuated by that\nhorrible wheezing, gurgling, tremulous breathing in the bed yonder.\nWould the doctor never come!\n\nShe was curiously conscious of her absolute lack of emotion.\n\nBut always the interminable thin whispering in the back of her head\nwent on and on. \"Oh, if he had only died four years ago! Oh, if he had\nonly died the dear, clean-minded, honest boy I used to know! When that\nnoise stops he will be dead. And then, perhaps, I shall be able to\ncry. Oh, if he had only died four years ago!\"\n\nAnd then _da capo_. On and on ran the interminable thin whispering as\nMargaret waited for death to come to Billy. Billy looked so old now,\nunder his many bandages. Surely he must be very, very near death.\n\nSuddenly, as Jukesbury wrapped new bandages about his forehead, Billy\nopened his eyes and, without further movement, smiled placidly up at\nhim.\n\n\"Hello, Jukesbury,\" said Billy Woods, \"where's my armour?\"\n\nJukesbury, too, smiled. \"The man is bringing it downstairs now,\" he\nanswered, quietly.\n\n\"Because,\" Billy went on, fretfully, \"I don't propose to miss the\nTrojan war. The princes orgulous with high blood chafed, you know, are\nall going to be there, and I don't propose to miss it.\"\n\nBehind his fat back, Petheridge Jukesbury waved a cautioning hand at\nMargaret, who had risen from her chair.\n\n\"But it is very absurd,\" Billy murmured, in the mere ghost of a voice,\n\"because men don't propose by mistake except in farces. Somebody told\nme that, but I can't remember who, because I am a misogynist. That is\na Greek word, and I would explain it to Peggy, if she would only give\nme a chance, but she can't because she has those seventeen hundred\nand fifty thousand children to look after. There must be some way to\nexplain to her, though, because where there's a will there is always\na way, and there were three wills. Uncle Fred should not have left so\nmany wills--who would have thought the old man had so much ink in him?\nBut I will be a very great painter, Uncle Fred, and make her sorry for\nthe way she has treated me, and _then_ Kathleen will understand I was\ntalking about Peggy.\"\n\nHis voice died away, and Margaret sat with wide eyes listening for it\nagain. Would the doctor never come!\n\nBilly was smiling and picking at the sheets.\n\n\"But Peggy is so rich,\" the faint voice presently complained--\"so\nbeastly rich! There is gold in her hair, and if you will look very\nclosely you will see that her lashes were pure gold until she dipped\nthem in the ink-pot. Besides, she expects me to sit up and beg for\nlumps of sugar, and I _never_ take sugar in my coffee. And Peggy\ndoesn't drink coffee at all, so I think it is very unfair, especially\nas Teddy Anstruther drinks like a fish and she is going to marry him.\nPeggy, why won't you marry me? You know I've always loved you, Peggy,\nand now I can tell you so because Uncle Fred has left me all his\nmoney. You think a great deal about money, Peggy. You said it was the\ngreatest thing in the world. And it must be, because it is the only\nthing--the _only_ thing, Peggy--that has been strong enough to keep\nus apart. A part is never greater than the whole, Peggy, but I will\nexplain about that when you open that desk. There are sharks in it.\nAren't there, Peggy?--_aren't_ there?\"\n\nHis voice had risen to a querulous tone. Gently the fat old man\nrestrained him.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Petheridge Jukesbury; \"dear me, yes. Why, dear me, of\ncourse.\"\n\nBut his warning hand held Margaret back--Margaret, who stood with big\ntears trickling down her cheeks.\n\n\"Dearer than life itself,\" Billy assented, wearily, \"but before God,\nloving you as I do, I wouldn't marry you now for all the wealth in the\nworld. I forget why, but all the world is a stage, you know, and they\ndon't use stages now, but only railroads. Is that why you rail at me\nso, Peggy? That is a joke. You ought to laugh at my jokes, because I\nlove you, but I can't ever, ever tell you so because you are rich. A\nrich man cannot pass through a needle's eye. Oh, Peggy, Peggy, I love\nyour eyes, but they're so _big_, Peggy!\"\n\nSo Billy Woods lay still and babbled ceaselessly. But through all his\nirrelevant talk, as you may see a tributary stream pulse unsullied\nin a muddied river, ran the thought of Peggy--of Peggy, and of her\ncruelty, and of her beauty, and of the money that stood between them.\n\nAnd Margaret, who could never have believed him in his senses,\nlistened and knew that in his delirium, the rudder of his thoughts\nsnapped, he could not but speak truth. As she crouched in the corner\nof the room, her face buried in an arm-chair, her gold hair half\nloosened, her shoulders monotonously heaving, she wept gently,\ninaudibly, almost happily.\n\nAlmost happily. Billy was dying, but she knew now, past any doubting,\nthat he loved her. The dear, clean-minded, honest boy had come\nback to her, and she could love him now without shame, and there was\nonly herself to be loathed.\n\n[Illustration: \"Regarded them with alert eyes.\"]\n\nThen the door opened. Then, with Colonel Hugonin, came Martin Jeal--a\nwisp of a man like a November leaf--and regarded them from under his\nshaggy white hair with alert eyes.\n\n\"Hey, what's this?\" said Dr. Jeal. \"Eh, yes! Eh--yes!\" he meditated,\nslowly. \"Most irregular. You must let us have the room, Miss Hugonin.\"\n\nIn the hall she waited. Hope! ah, of course, there was no hope! the\nthin little whisper told her.\n\nBy and bye, though--after centuries of waiting--the three men came\ninto the hall.\n\n\"Miss Hugonin,\" said Dr. Jeal, with a strange kindness in his voice,\n\"I don't think we shall need you again. I am happy to tell you,\nthough, that the patient is doing nicely--very nicely indeed.\"\n\nMargaret clutched his arm. \"You--you mean----\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Dr. Jeal, \"that there is no fracture. A slight\nconcussion of the brain, madam, and--so far as I can see--no signs of\ninflammation. Barring accidents, I think we'll have that young man out\nof bed in a week. Thanks,\" he added, \"to Mr.--er--Jukesbury here whose\nprompt action was, under Heaven, undoubtedly the means of staving off\nmeningitis and probably--indeed, more than probably--the means\nof saving Mr. Woods's life. It was splendid, sir, splendid! No\ndoctor--why, God bless my soul!\"\n\nFor Miss Hugonin had thrown her arms about Petheridge Jukesbury's neck\nand had kissed him vigorously.\n\n\"You beautiful child!\" said Miss Hugonin.\n\n\"Er--Jukesbury,\" said the Colonel, mysteriously, \"there's a little\ncognac in the cellar that--er--\" The Colonel jerked his thumb across\nthe hallway with the air of a conspirator. \"Eh?\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"Why--er--yes,\" said Mr. Jukesbury. \"Why--ah--yes, I think I might.\"\n\nThey went across the hall together. The Colonel's hand rested\nfraternally on Petheridge Jukesbury's shoulder.\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nThe next day there was a general exodus from Selwoode, and Margaret's\nsatellites dispersed upon their divers ways. Selwoode, as they\nunderstood it, was no longer hers; and they knew Billy Woods well\nenough to recognise that from Selwoode's new master there were no\ndesirable pickings to be had such as the philanthropic crew had\nfattened on these four years past. So there came to them, one and all,\nurgent telegrams or insistent letters or some equally unanswerable\ndemand for their presence elsewhere, such as are usually prevalent\namong our guests in very dull or very troublous times.\n\nMiss Hugonin smiled a little bitterly. She considered that the scales\nhad fallen from her eyes, and flattered herself that she was by way of\nbecoming a bit of a misanthrope; also, I believe, there was a note\nconcerning the hollowness of life and the worthlessness of society in\ngeneral. In a word, Margaret fell back upon the extreme cynicism and\nworld-weariness of twenty-three, and assured herself that she despised\neverybody, whereas, as a matter of fact, she never in her life\nsucceeded in disliking anything except mice and piano-practice, and,\nfor a very little while, Billy Woods; and this for the very excellent\nreason that the gods had fashioned her solely to the end that she\nmight love all mankind, and in return be loved by humanity in general\nand adored by that portion of it which inhabits trousers.\n\nBut, \"The rats always desert a sinking ship,\" said Miss Hugonin, with\nthe air of one delivering a particularly original sentiment. \"They\nmake me awfully tired, and I don't care for them in the least. But\nPetheridge Jukesbury is a _dear_, and I may be poor now, but I _did_\ntry to do good with the money when I had it, and _anyhow_, Billy is\ngoing to get well.\"\n\nAnd, after all, that was the one thing that really mattered, though of\ncourse Billy would always despise her. He would be quite right, too,\nthe girl thought humbly.\n\nBut the conventionalities of life are more powerful than even youthful\ncynicism and youthful heart-break. Prior to devoting herself to a\nloveless life and the commonplaces of the stoic's tub, Miss Hugonin\nwas compelled by the barest decency to bid her guests Godspeed.\n\nAnd Ad\u00e8le Haggage kissed her for the first time in her life. She had\nbeen a little awed by Miss Hugonin, the famous heiress--a little\njealous of her, I dare say, on account of Hugh Van Orden--but now she\nkissed her very heartily in farewell, and said, \"Don't forget you are\nto come to us as soon as _possible_,\" and was beyond any question\nperfectly sincere in saying it.\n\nAnd Hugh Van Orden almost dragged Margaret under the main stairway,\nand, far from showing any marked abhorrence to her in her present\nstate of destitution, implored her with tears in his eyes to marry him\nat once, and to bring the Colonel to live with them for the rest of\nhis natural existence.\n\nFor, \"It's damned impertinent of me, of course,\" Mr. Van Orden readily\nconceded, \"and I suppose I ought to beg your pardon for mentioning it,\nbut I _do_ love you to a perfectly unlimited extent. It's playing the\nvery deuce with my polo, Miss Hugonin, and as for my appetite--why,\nif you won't have me,\" cried Hugh, in desperation, \"I--I really, you\nknow, I don't believe I'll _ever_ be able to eat anything!\"\n\nWhen Margaret refused him--for the sixth time, I think--I won't swear\nthat she didn't kiss him under the dark stairway. And if she did, he\nwas a nice boy, and he deserved it.\n\nAnd as for Sarah Ellen Haggage, that unreverend old parasite brought\nher a blank cheque signed with her name, and mentioned quite a goodly\nsum as the extent to which Margaret might go for necessary expenses.\n\n\"For you'll need it,\" she said, and rubbed her nose reflectively.\n\"Moving is the very deuce for wasting money, because so many little\nthings keep cropping up. Now, remember, a quarter is quite enough to\ngive _any_ man for moving a trunk. And there's no earthly sense in\nyour taking a cab, Margaret--the street-car will bring you within a\nblock of our door. These little trifles count, dear. And don't let\nC\u00e9lestine pack your things, because she's abominably careless. Let\nMarie do it--and don't tip her. Give her an old hat. And if I were\nyou, I would certainly consult a lawyer about the legality of that\nidiotic will. I remember distinctly hearing that Mr. Woods was very\neccentric in his last days, and I haven't a doubt he was raving mad\nwhen, he left all his money to a great, strapping, long-legged young\nfellow, who is perfectly capable of taking care of himself. Getting\nbetter, is he? Well, I suppose I'm glad to hear it, but he'd much\nbetter have stayed in Paris--where, I remember distinctly hearing, he\nled the most dissipated and immoral life, my dear--instead of coming\nover here and upsetting everything.\" And again Mrs. Haggage rubbed her\nnose--indignantly.\n\n\"He _didn't_!\" said Margaret. \"And I _can't_ take your money,\nbeautiful! And I don't see how we can possibly come to stay with you.\"\n\n\"Don't you argue with me!\" Mrs. Haggage exhorted her. \"I'm not in any\ntemper to be argued with. I've spent the morning sewing bias\nstripes in a bias skirt--something which from a moral-ruining and\nresolution-overthrowing standpoint simply knocks the spots off Job.\nYou'll take that money, and you'll come to me as soon as you can,\nand--God bless you, my dear!\"\n\nAnd again Margaret was kissed. Altogether, it was a very osculatory\nmorning for Miss Hugonin.\n\nMr. Jukesbury's adieus, however, were more formal; and--I am sorry to\nsay it--the old fellow went away wondering if the rich Mr. Woods might\nnot conceivably be very grateful to the man who had saved his life and\nevince his gratitude in some agreeable and substantial form.\n\nMrs. Saumarez and Mr. Kennaston, also, were somewhat unenthusiastic in\ntheir parting. Kennaston could not feel quite at ease with Margaret,\nbrazen it as he might with devil-may-carish flippancy; and Kathleen\nhad by this an inkling as to how matters stood between Margaret and\nBilly, and was somewhat puzzled thereat, and loved the former in\nconsequence no more than any Christian female is compelled to love the\nwoman who, either unconsciously or with deliberation, purloins her\nancient lover. A woman rarely forgives the man who has ceased to care\nfor her; and rarelier still can she pardon the woman who has dared\nsucceed her in his affections.\n\nAnd besides, they were utterly engrossed with one another, and utterly\nhappy, and utterly selfish with the immemorial selfishness of lovers,\nwho cannot for a moment conceive that the whole world is not somehow\nbenefited by their happiness and does not await with breathless\ninterest the outcome of their bickerings with the blind bow-god, and\nfrom this providential delusion derive a meritorious and comfortable\nglow. So Mrs. Saumarez and Mr. Kennaston parted from Margaret with\nkindness, it is true, but not without awkwardness.\n\nAnd that was the man that almost she had loved! thought Margaret, as\nshe gazed on the whirl of dust left by their carriage-wheels. Gone\nwith a few perfunctory words of sympathy!\n\nAnd for my part, I think that the base Indian who threw a pearl away\nworth more than all his tribe was, in comparison with Felix Kennaston,\na shrewd and long-headed man. If you had given _me_ his chances,\nMargaret ... but this, however, is highly digressive.\n\nThe Colonel, standing beside her, used language that was unrefined.\nHis aspirations as to the future of Mr. Kennaston and Mr. Jukesbury,\nit appeared, were both lurid and unfriendly.\n\n\"But why, attractive?\" queried his daughter.\n\n\"May they be qualified with such and such adjectives!\" desired the\nColonel, fervently. \"They tried to lend me money--wouldn't hear of\nmy not taking it! In case of necessity.' Bah!\" said the Colonel, and\nshook his fist after the retreating carriages. \"May they be qualified\nwith such and such adjectives!\"\n\nHow happily she laughed! \"And you're swearing at them!\" she pouted.\n\"Oh, my dear, my dear, how hard you are on all my little friends!\"\n\n\"Of course I am,\" said the Colonel, stoutly. \"They've deprived me of\nthe pleasure of despising 'em. It was worth double the money, I tell\nyou! I never objected to any men quite so much. And now they've gone\nand behaved decently with the deliberate purpose of annoying me! Oh!\"\ncried the Colonel, and shook an immaculate, withered old hand toward\nthe spring sky, \"may they be qualified with such and such adjectives!\"\n\nAnd that, so far as we are concerned, was the end of Margaret's\nsatellites.\n\nMy dear Mrs. Grundy, may one point the somewhat obvious moral? I thank\nyou, madam, for your long-suffering kindness. Permit me, then, to\nvault toward my moral over the shoulders of a greater man.\n\nAmong the papers left by one Charles Dickens--a novelist who is\nobsolete now because he \"wallows naked in the pathetic\" and was\nfrequently guilty of a very vulgar sort of humour that actually made\npeople laugh, which, as we now know, is not the purpose of humour--a\nnovelist who incessantly \"caricatured Nature\" and by these inartistic\nand underhand methods created characters that are more real to us than\nthe folk we jostle in the street and (God knows!) far more vital and\nworthy of attention than the folk who \"cannot read Dickens\"--you will\nfind, I say, a note of an idea which he never afterward developed,\nrunning to this effect: \"Full length portrait of his lordship,\nsurrounded by worshippers. Sensible men enough, agreeable men enough,\nindependent men enough in a certain way; but the moment they begin\nto circle round my lord, and to shine with a borrowed light from\nhis lordship, heaven and earth, how mean and subservient! What a\ncompetition and outbidding of each other in servility!\"\n\nAnd this, with \"my lord\" and \"his lordship\" erased to make way for the\nword \"money,\" is my moral. The folk who have just left Selwoode were\nhonest enough as honesty goes nowadays; kindly as any of us dare\nbe who have our own way to make among very stalwart and determined\nrivals; generous as any man may venture to be in a world where\nthe first of every month finds the butcher and the baker and the\ncandlestick-maker rapping at the door with their little bills: but\nthey cringed to money. It was very wrong of them, my dear lady, and in\nextenuation I can only plead that they could no more help cringing to\nmoney than you or I can help it.\n\nThis is very crude and very cynical, but unfortunately it is true.\n\nWe always cringe to money; which is humiliating. And the sun always\nrises at an hour when sensible people are abed and have not the least\nneed for its services; which is foolish. And what you and I, my dear\nmadam, are to do about rectifying either one of these vexatious\ncircumstances, I am sure I don't know.\n\nWe can, at least, be honest. Let us, then, console ourselves at will\nwith moral observations concerning the number of pockets in a shroud\nand the difficulty of a rich man's entering into the kingdom of\nHeaven; but with an humble and reverent heart, let us admit that, in\nthe world we know, money rules. Its presence awes us. And if we are\nquite candid we must concede that we very unfeignedly envy and admire\nthe rich; we must grant that money confers a certain distinction on a\nman, be he the veriest ass that ever heehawed a platitude, and that we\ncannot but treat him accordingly, you and I.\n\nYou are friendly, of course, with your poor cousins; you are delighted\nto have them drop in to dinner, and liberal enough with the claret\nwhen they do; but when the magnate comes, there is a magnum of\nchampagne, and an extra lamp in the drawing-room, and--I blush to\nwrite it--a far more agreeable hostess at the head of the table. Dives\nis such good company, you see. And speaking for my own sex, I defy any\nhonest fellow to lay his hand upon his waistcoat and swear that it\ndoesn't give him a distinct thrill of pleasure to be seen in public\nwith a millionaire. Daily we truckle in the Eagle's shadow--the shadow\nthat lay so heavily across Selwoode. With the Eagle himself and with\nthe Eagle's work in the world--the grim, implacable, ruthless work\nthat hourly he goes about--our little comedy has naught to do;\nSchlemihl-like, we deal but in shadows. Even the shadow of the Eagle\nis a terrible thing--a shadow that, as Felix Kennaston has told you,\nchills faith, and charity, and independence, and kindliness, and\ntruth, and--alas--even common honesty.\n\nBut this is both cynical and digressive.\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\nDr. Jeal, better than his word, had Billy Woods out of bed in five\ndays. To Billy they were very long and very dreary days, and to\nMargaret very long and penitential ones. But Colonel Hugonin enjoyed\nthem thoroughly; for, as he feelingly and frequently observed, it is\nan immense consolation to any man to reflect that his home no longer\ncontains \"more damn' foolishness to the square inch than any other\nhouse in the United States.\"\n\nOn all sides they sought for Cock-eye Flinks. But they never found\nhim, and to this day they have never found him. The Fates having\nplayed their pawn, swept it from the board, and Cock-eye Flinks\ndisappeared in Clotho's capacious pocket.\n\nAll this time the young people saw nothing of one another. On this\npoint Jeal was adamantean.\n\n\"In a sick-room,\" he vehemently declared, \"a woman is well enough, but\n_the_ woman is the devil and all. I've told that young man plainly,\nsir, that he doesn't see your daughter till he gets well--and, by\nGeorge, sir, he'll get well now just in order to see her. Nature is\nthe only doctor who ever cures anybody, Colonel; we humans, for\nall our pill-boxes and lancets, can only prompt her--and devilish\ndemoralising advice we generally give her, too,\" he added, with a\nchuckle.\n\n\"Peggy!\"\n\nThis was the first observation of Mr. Woods when he came to his\nsenses. He swore feebly when Peggy was denied to him. He pleaded. He\nscolded. He even threatened, as a last resort, to get out of bed and\ngo in immediate search of her; and in return, Jeal told him very\naffably that it was far less difficult to manage a patient in a\nstraight-jacket than one out of it, and that personally nothing would\nplease him so much as a plausible pretext for clapping Mr. Woods into\none of 'em. Jeal had his own methods in dealing with the fractious.\n\nThen Billy clamoured for Colonel Hugonin, and subsequently the Colonel\ncame in some bewilderment to his daughter's rooms.\n\n\"Billy says that will ain't to be probated,\" he informed her, testily.\n\"I'm to make sure it ain't probated till he gets well. You're to give\nme your word you'll do nothing further in the matter till Billy gets\nwell. That's his message, and I'd like to know what the devil this\ninfernal nonsense means. I ain't a Fenian nor yet a Guy Fawkes,\ndaughter, and in consequence I'm free to confess I don't care for all\nthis damn mystery and shilly-shallying. But that's the message.\"\n\nMiss Hugonin debated with herself. \"That I will do nothing further in\nthe matter till Billy gets well,\" she repeated, reflectively. \"Yes, I\nsuppose I'll have to promise it, but you can tell him for me that I\nconsider he is _horrid_, and just as obstinate and selfish as he can\n_possibly_ be. Can you remember that, attractive?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you,\" said the Colonel. \"I can remember it, but I ain't\ngoing to. Nice sort of message to send a sick man, ain't it? I don't\nknow what's gotten into you, Margaret--no, begad, I don't! I think\nyou're possessed of seventeen devils. And now,\" the old gentleman\ndemanded, after an awkward pause, \"are you or are you not going to\ntell me what all this mystery is about?\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Miss Hugonin protested. \"It--it's a secret, attractive.\"\n\n\"It ain't,\" said the Colonel, flatly--\"it's some more damn\nfoolishness.\" And he went away in a fret and using language.\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\nLeft to herself, Miss Hugonin meditated.\n\nMiss Hugonin was in her kimono.\n\nAnd oh, Madame Chrysastheme! oh, Madame Butterfly! Oh, Mimosa San, and\nPitti Sing, and Yum Yum, and all ye vaunted beauties of Japan! if you\ncould have seen her in that garb! Poor little ladies of the Orient,\nhow hopelessly you would have wrung your henna-stained fingers! Poor\nlittle Ichabods of the East, whose glory departed irretrievably when\nshe adopted this garment, I tremble to think of the heart-burnings and\npalpitations and hari-karis that would have ensued.\n\nIt was pink--the pink of her cheeks to a shade. And scattered about it\nwere birds, and butterflies, and snaky, emaciated dragons, with backs\nlike saw-teeth, and prodigious fangs, and claws, and very curly tails,\nsuch as they breed in Nankeen plates and used to breed on packages of\nfire-crackers--all done in gold, the gold of her hair. Moreover, one\nmight catch a glimpse of her neck--which was a manifest favour of the\ngods--and about it mysterious, lacy white things intermingling with\ndivers tiny blue ribbons. I saw her in it once--by accident.\n\nAnd now I fancy, as she stood rigid with indignation, her cheeks\nflushed, it must have been a heady spectacle to note how their\nshell-pink repeated the pink of her fantastic garment like a chromatic\necho; and how her sunny hair, a thought loosened, a shade dishevelled,\nclung heavily about her face, a golden snare for eye and heart; and\nhow her own eyes, enormous, cerulean--twin sapphires such as in the\nold days might have ransomed a brace of emperors--grew wistful like a\nchild's who has been punished and does not know exactly why; and how\nher petulant mouth quivered and the long black lashes, golden at the\nroots, quivered, too--ah, yes, it must have been a heady spectacle.\n\n\"_Now_,\" she announced, \"I see plainly what he intends doing. He is\ngoing to destroy that will, and burden me once more with a large and\ninfluential fortune. I don't want it, and I won't take it, and he\nmight just as well understand that in the very beginning. I don't care\nif Uncle Fred did leave it to me--I didn't ask him to, did I? Besides,\nhe was a very foolish old man--if he had left the money to Billy\n_everything_ would have been all right. That's always the way--my\ndolls are invariably stuffed with sawdust, and I _never_ have a dear\ngazelle to glad me with his dappled hide, but when he comes to know me\nwell he falls upon the buttered side--or something to that effect. I\nhate poetry, anyhow--it's so mushy!\"\n\nAnd this from the Miss Hugonin who a week ago was interested in the\nFrench _decadents_ and partial to folk-songs from the Romaic! I think\nwe may fairly deduce that the reign of Felix Kennaston is over. The\nking is dead; and Margaret's thoughts and affections and her very\ndreams have fallen loyally to crying, Long live the king--his Majesty\nBilly the First.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Margaret, with an indignant gasp, what time her eyebrows\ngesticulated, \"I think Billy Woods is a meddlesome _piece_!--that's\nwhat I think! Does he suppose that after waiting all this time for the\nonly man in the world who can keep me interested for four hours on\na stretch and send my pulse up to a hundred and make me feel those\nthrilly thrills I've always longed for--does he suppose that now\nI'm going to pay any attention to his silly notions about wills and\nthings? He's abominably selfish! I shan't!\"\n\nMargaret moved across the room, shimmering, rustling, glittering like\na fairy in a pantomime. Then, to consider matters at greater ease, she\ncurled up on a divan in much the attitude of a tiny Cleopatra riding\nat anchor on a carpeted Cydnus.\n\n\"Billy thinks I want the money--bless his boots! He thinks I'm a\nstuck-up, grasping, purse-proud little pig, and he has every right\nto think so after the way I talked to him, though he ought to have\nrealised I was in a temper about Kathleen Saumarez and have paid no\nattention to what I said. And he actually attempted to reason with\nme! If he'd had _any_ consideration for my feelings, he'd have simply\nsmacked me and made me behave--however, he's a man, and all men are\nselfish, and _she's_ a skinny old thing, and I _never_ had any use for\nher. Bother her lectures! I never understood a word of them, and I\ndon't believe she does, either. Women's clubs are _all_ silly, and I\nthink the women who belong to them are _all_ bold-faced jigs! If\nthey had any sense, they'd stay at home and take care of the babies,\ninstead of messing with philanthropy, and education, and theosophy,\nand anything else that they can't make head or tail of. And they call\nthat being cultured! Culture!--I hate the word! I don't want to be\ncultured--I want to be happy.\"\n\nThis, you will observe, was, in effect, a sweeping recantation of\nevery ideal Margaret had ever boasted. But Love is a canny pedagogue,\nand of late he had instructed Miss Hugonin in a variety of matters.\n\n\"Before God, loving you as I do, I wouldn't marry you for all the\nwealth in the world,\" she repeated, with a little shiver. \"Even in his\ndelirium he said that. But I _know_ now that he loves me. And I know\nthat I adore him. And if this were a sensible world, I'd walk right in\nthere and explain things and ask him to marry me, and then it wouldn't\nmatter in the least who had the money. But I can't, because it\nwouldn't be proper. Bother propriety!--but bothering it doesn't do\nany good. As long as I have the money, Billy will never come near me,\nbecause of the idiotic way I talked to him. And he's bent on my taking\nthe money simply because it happens to belong to me. I consider that\na very silly reason. I'll _make_ Billy Woods take the money, and\nI'll make him see that I'm _not_ a little pig, and that I trust him\nimplicitly. And I think I'm quite justified in using a little--we'll\ncall it diplomacy--because otherwise he'd go back to France or some\nother objectionable place, and we'd both be _very_ unhappy.\"\n\nMargaret began to laugh softly. \"I've given him my word that I'll\ndo nothing further in the matter till he gets well. And I won't.\n_But_----\"\n\nMiss Hugonin rose from the divan with a gesture of sweeping back her\nhair. And then--oh, treachery of tortoise-shell! oh, the villainy of\nthose little gold hair-pins!--the fat twisted coils tumbled loose\nand slowly unravelled themselves, and her pink-and-white face,\nhalf-eclipsed, showed a delectable wedge between big, odourful,\ncrinkly, ponderous masses of hair. It clung about her, a heavy cloak,\nall shimmering gold like the path of sunset over the June sea. And\nMargaret, looking at herself in the mirror, laughed, and appeared\nperfectly content with what she saw there.\n\n\"But,\" said she, \"if the Fates are kind to me--and I sometimes think\nI _have_ a pull with the gods--I'll make you happy, Billy Woods, in\nspite of yourself.\"\n\nThe mirror flashed back a smile. Margaret was strangely interested in\nthe mirror.\n\n\"She has ringlets in her hair,\" sang Margaret happily--a low,\nhalf-hushed little song. She held up a strand of it to demonstrate\nthis fact.\n\n\"There's a dimple in her chin\"--and, indeed, there was. And a dimple\nin either cheek, too.\n\nFor a long time afterward she continued to smile at the mirror. I am\nafraid Kathleen Saumarez was right. She was a vain little cat, was\nMargaret.\n\nBut, barring a rearrangement of the cosmic scheme, I dare say maids\nwill continue to delight in their own comeliness so long as mirrors\nspeak truth. Let us, then, leave Miss Hugonin to this innocent\ndiversion. The staidest of us are conscious of a brisk elation at\nsight of a pretty face; and surely no considerate person will deny its\nowner a portion of the pleasure that daily she accords the beggar at\nthe street-corner.\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\nWe are credibly informed that Time travels in divers paces with divers\npersons--the statement being made by a lady who may be considered to\nspeak with some authority, having triumphantly withstood the ravages\nof Chronos for a matter of three centuries. But I doubt if even the\ninsolent sweet wit of Rosalind could have devised a fitting simile for\nTime's gait at Selwoode those five days that Billy lay abed. Margaret\ncould not but marvel at the flourishing proportion attained by the\nhours in those sunlit spring days; and at dinner, say, her thoughts\nharking back to luncheon, recalled it by a vigorous effort as an\naffair of the dim yester-years--a mere blurred memory, faint and vague\nas a Druidical tenet or a Merovingian squabble.\n\nBut the time passed for all that; and eventually--it was just before\ndusk--she came, with Martin Jeal's permission, into the room where\nBilly was. And beside the big open fireplace, where a wood fire\nchattered companionably, sat a very pallid Billy, a rather thin Billy,\nwith a great many bandages about his head.\n\nYou may depend upon it, Margaret was not looking her worst that\nafternoon. By actual count, C\u00e9lestine had done her hair six times\nbefore reaching an acceptable result.\n\nAnd, \"Yes, C\u00e9lestine, you may get out that pale yellow dress. No,\nbeautiful, the one with the black satin stripes on the bodice--because\nI don't want my hair cast completely in the shade, do I? Now, let me\nsee--black feather, gloves, large pompadour, _and_ a sweet smile. No,\nI don't want a fan--that's a Lydia Languish trade-mark. And _two_ silk\nskirts rustling like the deadest leaves imaginable. Yes, I think that\nwill do. And if you can't hook up my dress without pecking and pecking\nat me like that, I'll probably go stark, _staring_ crazy, C\u00e9lestine,\nand then you'll be sorry. No, it isn't a bit tight--are you perfectly\ncertain there's no powder behind my ears, C\u00e9lestine? Now, _please_ try\nto fasten the collar without pulling all my hair down. Ye-es, I think\nthat will do, C\u00e9lestine. Well, it's very nice of you to say so, but I\ndon't believe I much fancy myself in yellow, after all.\"\n\nEquipped and armed for conquest, then, she came into the room with a\nvery tolerable affectation of unconcern. Altogether, it was a quite\neffective entrance.\n\n\"I've been for a little drive, Billy,\" she mendaciously informed him.\n\"That's how you happen to have the opportunity of seeing me in all my\nnice new store-clothes. Aren't you pleased, Billy? No, don't you dare\nget up!\" Margaret stood across the room, peeling off her gloves and\nregarding him on the whole with disapproval. \"They've been starving\nyou,\" she pensively reflected. \"As soon as that Jeal person goes away,\nI shall have six little beefsteaks cooked and see to it personally\nthat you eat every one of them. And I'll cook a cherry pie--quick as\na cat can wink her eye--won't I, Billy? That Jeal person is a decided\nnuisance,\" said Miss Hugonin, as she stabbed her hat rather viciously\nwith two hat-pins and then laid it aside on a table.\n\nBilly Woods was looking up at her forlornly. It hurt her to see the\nlove and sorrow in his face. But oh, how avidly his soul drank in the\nmodulations of that longed-for voice--a voice that was honey and gold\nand velvet and all that is most sweet and rich and soft in the world.\n\n\"Peggy,\" said he, plunging at the heart of things, \"where's that\nwill?\"\n\nMiss Hugonin kicked forward a little foot-stool to the other side of\nthe fire, and sat down and complacently smoothed out her skirts.\n\n\"I knew it!\" said she. \"I never saw such a one-idea'd person in my\nlife. I knew that would be the very first thing you would ask for,\nBilly Woods, because you're such an obstinate, stiffnecked _donkey_.\nVery well!\"--and Margaret tossed her head--\"here's Uncle Fred's will,\nthen, and you can do _exactly_ as you like with it, and _now_ I hope\nyou're satisfied!\" And Margaret handed him the long envelope which lay\nin her lap.\n\nMr. Woods promptly opened it.\n\n\"That,\" Miss Hugonin commented, \"is what I term very unladylike\nbehaviour on your part.\"\n\n\"You evidently don't trust me, Billy Woods. Very well! I don't care!\nRead it carefully--very carefully, and make quite sure I haven't been\ndabbling in forgery of late--besides, it's so good for your eyes, you\nknow, after being hit over the head,\" Margaret suggested, cheerfully.\n\nBilly chuckled. \"That's true,\" said he, \"but I know Uncle Fred's fist\nwell enough without having to read it all. Candidly, Peggy, I _had_ to\nlook at it, because I--well, I didn't quite trust you, Peggy. And\nnow we're going to burn this interesting paper, you and I.\" \"Wait!\"\nMargaret cried. \"Ah, wait, just a moment, Billy!\"\n\nHe glanced up at her in surprise, the paper still poised in his hand.\n\nShe sat with head drooped forward, her masculine little chin thrust\nout eagerly, her candid eyes transparently appraising him.\n\n\"Why are you going to burn it, Billy?\"\n\n\"Why?\" Mr. Woods, repeated, thoughtfully. \"Well, for a variety of\nreasons. First is, that Uncle Fred really did leave his money to you,\nand burning this is the only way of making sure you get it. Why, I\nthought you wanted me to burn it! Last time I saw you--\"\n\n\"I was in a temper,\" said Margaret, haughtily. \"You ought to have seen\nthat.\"\n\n\"Yes, I--er--noticed it,\" Mr. Woods admitted, with some dryness; \"but\nit wasn't only temper. You've grown accustomed to the money. You'd\nmiss it now--miss the pleasure it gives you, miss the power it gives\nyou. You'd never be content to go back to the old life now. Why,\nPeggy, you yourself told me you thought money the greatest thing in\nthe world! It has changed you, Peggy, this--ah, well!\" said Billy, \"we\nwon't talk about that. I'm going to burn it because that's the only\nhonourable thing to do. Ready, Peggy?\"\n\n\"It may be honourable, but it's _extremely_ silly,\" Margaret\ntemporised, \"and for my part, I'm very, very glad God had run out of a\nsense of honour when He created the woman.\"\n\n\"Phrases don't alter matters. Ready, Peggy?\"\n\n\"Ah, no, phrases don't alter matters!\" she assented, with a quick lift\nof speech. \"You're going to destroy that will, Billy Woods, simply\nbecause you think I'm a horrid, mercenary, selfish _pig_. You think I\ncouldn't give up the money--you think I couldn't be happy without it.\nWell, you have every right to think so, after the way I've behaved.\nBut why not tell me that is the real reason?\"\n\nBilly raised his hand in protest. \"I--I think you might miss it,\" he\nconceded. \"Yes, I think you would miss it.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said Margaret, quickly. \"The money is yours now--by my act.\nYou say you--care for me. If I am the sort of woman you think me--I\ndon't say I am, and I don't say I'm not--but thinking me that sort of\nwoman, don't you think I'd--I'd marry you for the asking if you kept\nthe money? Don't you think you're losing every chance of me by burning\nthat will? Oh, I'm not standing on conventionalities now! Don't you\nthink that, Billy?\"\n\nShe was tempting him to the uttermost; and her heart was sick with\nfear lest he might yield. This was the Eagle's last battle; and\nrecreant Love fought with the Eagle against poor Billy, who had only\nhis honour to help him.\n\nMargaret's face was pale as she bent toward him, her lips parted a\nlittle, her eyes glinting eerily in the firelight. The room was dark\nnow save in the small radius of its amber glow; beyond that was\ndarkness where panels and brasses blinked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Billy, gravely--\"forgive me if I'm wrong, dear, but--I\ndo think that. But you see you don't care for me, Peggy. In the\nsummer-house I thought for a moment--ah, well, you've shown in a\nhundred ways that you don't care--and I wouldn't have you come to me,\nnot caring. So I'm going to burn the paper, dear.\"\n\nMargaret bowed her head. Had she ever known happiness before?\n\n\"It is not very flattering to me,\" she said, \"but it shows that\nyou--care--a great deal. You care enough to--let me go. Ah--yes. You\nmay burn it now, Billy.\"\n\nAnd promptly he tossed it into the flames. For a moment it lay\nunharmed; then the edges caught and crackled and blazed, and their\nheads drew near together as they watched it burn.\n\nThere (thought Billy) is the end! Ah, ropes, daggers, and poisons!\nthere is the end! Oh, Peggy. Peggy, if you could only have loved me!\nif only this accursed money hadn't spoiled you so utterly! Billy was\nquite properly miserable over it.\n\nBut he raised his head with a smile. \"And now,\" said he--and not\nwithout a little, little bitterness; \"if I have any right to advise\nyou, Peggy, I--I think I'd be more careful in the future as to how I\nused the money. You've tried to do good with it, I know. But every\ngood cause has its parasites. Don't trust entirely to the Haggages and\nJukesburys, Peggy, and--and don't desert the good ship Philanthropy\nbecause there are a few barnacles on it, dear.\"\n\n\"You make me awfully tired,\" Miss Hugonin observed, as she rose to her\nfeet. \"How do you suppose I'm going to do anything for Philanthropy or\nany other cause when I haven't a penny in the world? You see, you've\njust burned the last will Uncle Fred ever made--the one that left\neverything to me. The one in your favour was probated or proved or\nwhatever they call it a week ago.\" I think Billy was surprised.\n\nShe stood over him, sharply outlined against the darkness, clasping\nher hands tightly just under her chin, ludicrously suggestive of a\npre-Raphaelitish saint. In the firelight her hair was an aureole; and\nher gown, yellow with multitudinous tiny arabesques of black velvet,\nechoed the glow of her hair to a shade. The dancing flames made of her\na flickering little yellow wraith. And oh, the quaint tenderness of\nher eyes!--oh, the hint of faint, nameless perfume she diffused! thus\nran the meditations of Billy's dizzied brain.\n\n\"Listen! I told you I burned the other will. I started to burn it. But\nI was afraid to, because I didn't know what they could do to me if I\ndid. So I put it away in my little handkerchief-box--and if you'd had\na _grain_ of sense you'd have noticed the orris on it. And you made me\npromise not to take any steps in the matter till you got well. I knew\nyou would. So I had already sent that second will--sent it before I\npromised you--to Hunston Wyke--he's my lawyer now, you know--and I've\nheard from him, and he has probated it.\"\n\nBilly was making various irrelevant sounds.\n\n\"And I brought that other will to you, and if you didn't choose to\nexamine it more carefully I'm sure it wasn't my fault. I kept my word\nlike a perfect gentleman and took no step _whatever_ in the matter.\nI didn't say a word when before my eyes you stripped me of my entire\nworldly possessions--you know I didn't. You burned it up yourself,\nBilly Woods--of your own free will and accord--and now Selwoode and\nall that detestable money belongs to _you_, and I'm sure I'd like to\nknow what you are going to do about it. So _there_!\"\n\nMargaret faced him defiantly. Billy was in a state of considerable\nperturbation.\n\n\"Why have you done this?\" he asked, slowly. But a lucent\nsomething--half fear, half gladness--was wakening in Billy's eyes.\n\nAnd her eyes answered him. But her tongue was far less veracious.\n\n\"Because you thought I was a _pig_! Because you couldn't make\nallowances for a girl who for four years has seen nothing but money\nand money-worshippers and the power of money! Because I wanted\nyour--your respect, Billy. And you thought I couldn't give it up! Very\nwell!\" Miss Hugonin waved her hand airily toward the hearth. \"Now I\nhope you know better. _Don't you dare get up, Billy Woods!_\"\n\nBut I think nothing short of brute force could have kept Mr. Woods\nfrom her.\n\n\"Peggy,\" he babbled--\"ah, forgive me if I'm a presumptuous ass--but\nwas it because you knew I couldn't ask you to marry me so long as you\nhad the money?\"\n\nShe dallied with her bliss. Margaret was on the other side of the\ntable.\n\n\"Why--why, of course it wasn't!\" she panted. \"What nonsense!\"\n\n\"Look at me, Peggy!\"\n\n\"I don't want to! You look like a fright with your head all tied up.\"\n\n\"Peggy ... this exercise is bad for an invalid.\"\n\n\"I--oh, please sit down! _Please_, Billy! It is bad for you.\"\n\n\"Not until you tell me----\"\n\n\"But I _don't!_... Oh, you make me _awfully_ tired.\"\n\n\"Peggy, don't you dare stamp your foot at me!... Peggy!\"\n\n\"_Please_ sit down! Now ... well, there's my hand, stupid, if you\n_will_ be silly. Now sit down here--so, with your head leaned back on\nthis nice little cushion because it's good for your poor head--and\nI'll sit on this nice little footstool and be quite, quite honest. No,\nyou must lean back--I don't care if you can't see me, I'd much rather\nyou couldn't. Well, the truth is--no, you _must_ lean back--the truth\nis--I've loved you all my life, Billy Woods, and--no, not _yet_,\nBilly--and if you hadn't been the stupidest beautiful in the universe\nyou'd have seen it long ago. You--you needn't--lean back--any longer,\nBilly ... Oh, Billy, why _didn't_ you shave?\"\n\n\"She _is_ skinny, isn't she, Billy?\"\n\n\"Now, Peggy, you mustn't abuse Kathleen. She's a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Well, I know she's a friend of yours, but that doesn't prevent her\nbeing skinny, does it?\"\n\n\"Now, Peggy--\"\n\n\"Please, Billy! _Please_ say she's skinny!\"\n\n\"Er--well, she's a bit thin, perhaps.\"\n\n\"You angel!\"\n\n\"And you're quite sure you've forgiven me for doubting you?\"\n\n\"And you've forgiven _me?_\"\n\n\"Bless you, Peggy, I never doubted you! I've been too busy loving\nyou.\"\n\n\"It seems to me as if it had been--_always_.\"\n\n\"Why, didn't we love one another in Carthage, Peggy?\"\n\n\"I think it was in Babylon, Billy.\"\n\n\"And will love one another----?\"\n\n\"Forever and ever, dear. You've been to seek a wife, Billy boy.\"\n\n\"And oh, the dimple in her chin...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAh, well! There was a deal of foolish prattle there in the\nfirelight--delectable prattle, irresponsible as the chattering of\nbirds after a storm. And I fancy that the Eagle's shadow is lifted\nfrom Selwoode, now that Love has taken up his abode there.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Eagle's Shadow, by James Branch Cabell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EAGLE'S SHADOW ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10882-8.txt or 10882-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/8/8/10882/\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Bradley Norton and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n"}
