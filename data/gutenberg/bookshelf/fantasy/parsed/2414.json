And yet he is wonderfully near us, whereas he is\nseparated by a great gulf from the rude trouveres of the Chansons\nde Gestes and from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was still\ndragging out its weary length in his early days. Chretien is as\nrefined, as civilised, as composite as we are ourselves; his\nladies are as full of whims, impulses, sudden reserves,\nself-debate as M. Paul Bourget's heroines; while the problems of\nconscience and of emotion which confront them are as complex as\nthose presented on the modern stage. Indeed, there is no break\nbetween the Breton romance and the psychological-analytical novel\nof our own day.\n\nWhence comes this amazing modernity and complexity? From many\nsources:--Provencal love-lore, Oriental subtlety, and Celtic\nmysticism--all blended by that marvellous dexterity, style,\nmalice, and measure which are so utterly French that English has\nno adequate words for them. We said \"Celtic mysticism,\" but there\nis something else about Chretien which is also Celtic, though\nvery far from being \"mystic\". We talk a great deal nowadays about\nCeltic melancholy, Celtic dreaminess, Celtic \"other-worldliness\";\nand we forget the qualities that made Caesar's Gauls, St. Paul's\nGalatians, so different from the grave and steadfast Romans--that\nloud Gaulois that has made the Parisian the typical Frenchman. A\ndifferent being, this modern Athenian, from the mystic Irish\npeasant we see in the poetic modern Irish drama!--and yet both\nare Celts.\n\nNot much \"other-worldliness\" about Chretien. He is as positive as\nany man can be. His is not of the world of Saint Louis, of the\nCrusaders, of the Cathedral-builders. In Cliges there is no\nreligious atmosphere at all. We hear scarcely anything of Mass,\nof bishops, of convents. When he mentions Tierce or Prime, it is\nmerely to tell us the hour at which something happened--and this\nsomething is never a religious service. There is nothing behind\nthe glamour of arms and love, except for the cas de conscience\npresented by the lovers. Nothing but names and framework are\nCeltic; the spirit, with its refinements and its hair-splitting,\nis Provencal. But what a brilliant whole! what art! what measure!\nOur thoughts turn to the gifted women of the age--as subtle, as\ninteresting, and as unscrupulous as the women of the\nRenaissance--to Eleanor of Aquitaine, a reigning princess, a\ntroubadour, a Crusader, the wife of two kings, the mother of two\nkings, to the last, intriguing and pulling the strings of\npolitical power--\"An Ate, stirring him [King John] to blood and\nstrife.\"\n\nThe twelfth century was an age in which women had full scope--in\nwhich the Empress Maud herself took the field against her foe, in\nwhich Stephen's queen seized a fortress, in which a wife could\nmove her husband to war or to peace, in which a Marie of\nChampagne (Eleanor's daughter) could set the tone of great poets\nand choose their subjects.\n\nIf, then, this woman-worship, this complexity of love, this\nself-debating, first comes into literature with Chretien de\nTroyes, and is still with us, no more interesting work exists\nthan his earliest masterpiece, Cliges. The delicate and reticent\nSoredamors; the courteous and lovable, Guinevere; the proud and\npassionate Fenice, who will not sacrifice her fair fame and\nchastity; the sorceress Thessala, ancestress of Juliet's\nnurse--these form a gallery of portraits unprecedented in\nliterature.\n\nThe translator takes this opportunity of thanking Mr. B. J.\nHayes, M.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge, for occasional\nhelp, and also for kindly reading the proofs.\n\n\n\nCLIGES\n\nTHE clerk who wrote the tale of Erec and Enid, and translated the\nCommandments of Ovid and the Art of Love, and composed the Bite\nof the Shoulder, and sang of King Mark and of the blonde Iseult,\nand of the metamorphosis of the Hoopoe and of the Swallow and of\nthe Nightingale, is now beginning a new tale of a youth who was\nin Greece of the lineage of King Arthur. But before I tell you\nanything of him, you shall hear his father's life--whence he was\nand of what lineage. So valiant was he and of such proud spirit,\nthat to win worth and praise he went from Greece to England,\nwhich was then called Britain. We find this story that I desire\nto tell and to relate to you, recorded in one of the books of the\nlibrary of my lord Saint Peter at Beauvais. Thence was taken the\ntale from which Chretien framed this romance. The book, which\ntruthfully bears witness to the story, is very ancient; for this\nreason it is all the more to be believed. From the books which we\npossess, we know the deeds of the ancients and of the world which\naforetime was. This our books have taught us: that Greece had the\nfirst renown in chivalry and in learning. Then came chivalry to\nRome, and the heyday of learning, which now is come into France.\nGod grant that she be maintained there; and that her home there\nplease her so much that never may depart from France the honour\nwhich has there taken up its abode. God had lent that glory to\nothers; but no man talks any longer either more or less about\nGreeks and Romans; talk of them has ceased, and the bright glow\nis extinct.\n\nChretien begins his tale--as the story relates to us--which tells\nof an emperor mighty in wealth and honour, who ruled Greece and\nConstantinople. There was a very noble empress by whom the\nemperor had two children. But the first was of such an age before\nthe other was born, that if he had willed he might have become a\nknight and held all the empire. The first was named Alexander;\nthe younger was called Alis. The father too had for name\nAlexander; and the mother had for name Tantalis. I will\nstraight-away leave speaking of the empress Tantalis, of the\nemperor, and of Alis. I will speak to you of Alexander, who was\nso great-hearted and proud that he did not stoop to become a\nknight in his own realm. He had heard mention made of King\nArthur, who was reigning at that time; and of the barons which he\never maintained in his retinue wherefore his Court was feared and\nfamed throughout the world. Howe'er the end may fall out for him,\nand whate'er may come of it for the lad, there is nought that\nwill hold him from his yearning to go to Britain; but it is meet\nthat he take leave of his father before he goes to Britain or to\nCornwall. Alexander the fair, the valiant, goes to speak to the\nemperor in order to ask permission and to take his leave. Now\nwill he tell him what is his vow, and what he would fain do and\ntake in hand. \"Fair sire, that I may be schooled in honour and\nwin worth and renown, a boon,\" quoth he, \"I venture to crave of\nyou--a boon that I would have you give me; never defer it now for\nme if you are destined to grant it.\" The emperor had no thought\nof being vexed for that, either much or little; he is bound to\ndesire and to covet honour for his son above aught else. He would\ndeem himself to be acting well--would deem? ay, and he would be\nso acting--if he increased his son's honour. \"Fair son,\" quoth\nhe, \"I grant you your good pleasure, and tell me what you would\nhave me give you.\" Now the lad has done his work well; and right\nglad was he of it when is granted him the boon that he so longed\nto have. \"Sire,\" quoth he, \"would you know what you have promised\nme? I wish to have in great store of your gold and of your silver\nand comrades from your retinue such as I shall will to choose;\nfor I wish to go forth from your empire, and I shall go to offer\nmy service to the king who reigns over Britain, that he may dub\nme knight. Never, indeed, on any day as long as I live shall I\nwear visor on my face or helm on my head, I warrant you, till\nKing Arthur gird on my sword if he deign to do it; for I will\nreceive arms of no other.\" The emperor without more ado replies:\n\"Fair son, in God's name, say not so. This land and mighty are\ndiverse and contrary. And that man is a slave. Constantinople is\nwholly yours. You must not hold me a niggard when I would fain\ngive you so fair a boon. Soon will I have you crowned; and a\nknight shall you be to-morrow. All Greece shall be in your hand;\nand you shall receive from your barons--as indeed you ought to\nreceive--their oaths and homage. He who refuses this is no wise\nman.\"\n\nThe lad hears the promise--namely, that his father will dub him\nknight on the morrow after Mass--but says that he will prove\nhimself coward or hero in another land than his own. \"If you will\ngrant my boon in that matter in which I have asked you; then give\nme fur both grey and of divers colour and good steeds and silken\nattire; for before I am knight I will fain serve King Arthur. Not\nyet have I so great valour that I can bear arms. None by entreaty\nor by fair words could persuade me not to go into the foreign\nland to see the king and his barons, whose renown for courtesy\nand for prowess is so great. Many high men through their idleness\nlose great praise that they might have if they wandered o'er the\nworld. Repose and praise agree all together, as it seems to me;\nfor a man of might who is ever resting in no wise becomes famous.\nProwess is a burden to a cowardly man; and cowardice is a burden\nto the brave; thus the twain to his possessions who is ever\nheaping them up and increasing them. Fair sire, as long as I am\nallowed to win renown, if I can avail so much, I will give my\npains and diligence to it.\"\n\nAt this, without doubt, the emperor feels joy and anxiety--joy\nhas he; for that he perceives that his son aims at valiant deeds;\nand anxiety on the other hand, for that he is leaving him. But\nbecause of the promise that he has made him it behoves him to\ngrant his boon whatever anxiety he feel about it; for an emperor\nmust not lie. \"Fair son,\" quoth he, \"I ought not to fail to do\nyour pleasure, since I see that you aspire to honour. You may\ntake from my treasury two barques full of gold and silver; but\ntake care that you be very generous and courteous and well-bred.\"\nNow is the youth right glad; for his father promises him so much\nthat he puts his treasure at his free disposal and exhorts and\ncommands him to give and to spend liberally; and also he tells\nhim the reason wherefore: \"Fair son,\" quoth he, \"believe me in\nthis; that open-handedness is the lady and queen who illumines\nall virtues; and it is not a whit difficult to prove this. In\nwhat place could one find a man, however mighty and magnificent\nhe be, that is not blamed if he be a niggard; or any man, however\nill-reputed he be, whom liberality does not render praised?\nLiberality of itself makes a man of honour--which neither high\nRank, nor courtesy, nor knowledge, nor noble birth, nor wealth,\nnor strength, nor chivalry, nor courage, nor lordship, nor\nbeauty, nor any other thing, can do. But just as the rose is\nfairer than any other flower when she buddeth fresh and new; so\nwhere liberality comes she holds herself above all virtues, and\nshe multiplies five hundredfold the virtues that she finds in an\nhonourable man who proves his worth. There is so much to say\nabout liberality that I could not tell the half of it.\" Well has\nthe lad succeeded in whatsoever he has requested and asked; for\nhis father has found for him all that his desire conceived.\nExceeding sorrowful was the empress when she heard of the road\nwhich her son must needs follow; but whoever has grief and\nanxiety thereof, or whoever deems his conduct but folly, or\nblames and dissuades him, the youth as quickly as he could bade\nhis ships be got ready; for he had no wish to stay longer in his\nown country. The ships were loaded that night by his command with\nwine with meat and with biscuits.\n\nThe ships are loaded in the harbour and on the morrow with great\njoyance came Alexander to the sandy shore; and with him his\ncomrades who were fain of the journey. The emperor convoys him\nand the empress who was sad at heart. In the harbour they find\nthe mariners in the ships beside the cliff. The sea was peaceful\nand smooth the wind gentle and the air serene. Alexander first of\nall, when he had parted from his father and on taking leave of\nthe empress whose heart was sad within her, enters from the boat\ninto the ship and his comrades with him. Four, three, and two,\nthey simultaneously strive to enter without delay. Full soon was\nthe sail spread and the anchor of the barque weighed. Those on\nland, who were sore at heart for the lads whom they see\ndeparting, follow them with their eyes' ken as far as they can;\nand so that they may watch them the better and the further, they\ngo off and climb together a high peak by the shore. Thence they\nwatch their sorrow as far as they can see them. They gaze at\ntheir own sorrow in sooth; for great is their sorrow for the\nlads: may God lead them to port without disaster and without\nperil!\n\nThey were at sea all April and part of May. Without great peril\nand without alarm they made land above Southampton. One day\n'twixt Nones and Vespers they cast anchor and have made the port.\nThe youths, who had never previously learned to suffer discomfort\nor pain, had stayed on the sea which was not wholesome for them\nso long that all are pale and all the strongest and most healthy\nare weakened and nerveless. And, nevertheless, they show great\njoy; for that they have escaped from the sea and come hither\nwhere they would be. And because they were suffering greatly,\nthey lie that night above Southampton and show great joy and let\nask and inquire whether the king is in England. They are told\nthat he is at Winchester; and that they can be there full soon if\nthey will depart with morning provided that they keep to the\nright way. This news pleases them well; and on the morrow, when\nthe day is born, the lads wake up with morning and equip and\nprepare themselves. And when they were equipped they have turned\nfrom above Southampton and have kept to the right way till they\nhave reached Winchester where the king was tarrying. Before Prime\nthe Greeks had come to Court. They dismount at the foot of the\nsteps, the squires and the horses stayed in the court below; and\nthe youths ascend to the presence of the best king that ever was\nor ever may be in the world. And when the king sees them come,\nthey please and delight him much; but ere they had come before\nhim, they throw off the cloaks from their necks that they might\nnot be taken for clowns. Thus all having thrown off their cloaks\nhave come before the king. And the barons one and all keep\nsilence; for the youths please them mightily for that they see\nthem fair and comely. Never do they dream that they are all sons\nof counts or of a king; yet truly so they were, and they were in\nthe flower of their youth, comely and well set up in body; and\nthe robes that they wore were of one cloth and one cut, of one\nappearance and one colour. Twelve were they without their lord of\nwhom I will tell you this much without more ado; that none was\nbetter than he; but without arrogance and yet unabashed he stood\nwith his mantle off before the king, and was very fair and well\nshaped. He has kneeled down before him, and all the others from\ncourtesy, kneel beside their lord.\n\nAlexander, whose tongue was sharpened to speak well and wisely,\ngreets the king. \"King,\" quoth he, \"if renown lie not concerning\nyou since God made the first man, no king with faith in God was\nborn so powerful as you. King, the report that is in men's mouths\nhas brought me to your Court to serve and honour you, and if my\nservice is pleasing I will stay till I be a new-made knight at\nyour hand, not at that of another. For never shall I be dubbed\nknight if I be not so by you. If my service so please you that\nyou will to make me a knight, keep me, gracious king, and my\ncomrades who are here.\" Straightway the king replies: \"Friend,\"\nquoth he, \"I reject not a whit either you or your company; but ye\nare all right welcome; for ye have the air, I well think it, of\nbeing sons of men of high rank. Whence are ye?\" \"We are from\nGreece.\" \"From Greece?\" \"Truly are we.\" \"Who is thy father?\"\n\"Faith, sire, the emperor.\" \"And what is thy name, fair friend?\"\n\"Alexander was the name given me when I received salt and chrism\nand Christianity and baptism.\" \"Alexander, fair dear friend, I\nkeep you right willingly; and much does it please and joy me, for\nyou have done me exceeding great honour in that you are come to\nmy Court. It is my good pleasure that you be honoured here as a\nnoble warrior, wise and gentle. Too long have you been on your\nknees: rise, I bid you, and henceforth be free of my Court and of\nme; for you have arrived at  a good haven.\"\n\nForthwith the Greeks rise. Blithe are they for that the king has\nthus courteously kept them. Alexander is welcome; for there is no\nlack of aught that he wishes nor is there any baron in the Court\nso high that he does not speak him fair and welcome him. For he\nis not foolish nor boastful nor doth he vaunt his noble birth. He\nmakes himself known to Sir Gawain and to the others one by one.\nHe makes himself much loved by each; even Sir Gawain loves him so\nmuch that he hails him as friend and comrade. The Greeks had\ntaken in the town at the house of a citizen the best lodging that\nthey could find. Alexander had brought great possessions from\nConstantinople: he will desire above aught else to follow\ndiligently the emperor's advice and counsel--namely, that he\nshould have his heart wide-awake to give and to spend liberally.\nHe gives great diligence and pains thereto. He lives well at his\nlodging and gives and spends liberally as it beseems his wealth,\nand as his heart counsels him. The whole Court marvels whence his\nstore is taken; for he gives to all horses of great price which\nhe had brought from his land. So much trouble has Alexander given\nhimself, and so much has he prevailed by his fair service, that\nthe king loves and esteems him dearly as well the barons and the\nqueen.\n\nAt that point of time King Arthur desired to pass over into\nBrittany. He bids all his barons assemble in order to seek\nCounsel, and ask them to whom till he return he can entrust\nEngland, who may keep and maintain it in peace. By the Council it\nwas with one consent entrusted, as I think, to Count Engres of\nWindsor; for till then they deemed no baron more loyal in all the\nking's land. When this man had the land in his power, King Arthur\nand the queen and her ladies set out on the morrow. In Brittany\nfolk hear tell that the king and his barons are coming: the\nBretons rejoice greatly thereat.\n\nInto the ship in which the king crossed entered neither youth nor\nmaiden save Alexander alone; and the queen of a truth brought\nthither Soredamors, a lady who scorned Love. Never had she heard\ntell of a man whom she could deign to love however much beauty\nprowess dominion or high rank he had. And yet the damsel was so\nwinsome and fair that she might well have known Love if it had\npleased her to turn her mind to it; but never had she willed to\nbend her mind thereto. Now will Love make her sorrowful; and Love\nthinks to avenge himself right well for the great pride and\nresistance which she has always shown to him. Right well has Love\naimed; for he has stricken her in the heart with his arrow. Oft\nshe grows pale; oft the beads of sweat break out, and in spite of\nherself she must love. Scarce can she refrain from looking\ntowards Alexander; but she must needs guard herself against my\nLord Gawain her brother. Dearly does she buy and pay for her\ngreat pride and her disdain. Love has heated for her a bath which\nmightily inflames and enkindles her. Now is he kind to her, now\ncruel; now she wants him, and now she rejects him. She accuses\nher eyes of treachery and says: \"Eyes, you have betrayed me.\nThrough you has my heart which was wont to be faithful conceived\nhatred for me. Now does what I see bring grief. Grief? Nay, in\ntruth, but rather pleasure. And if I see aught that grieves me,\nstill have I not my eyes under my own sway? My strength must\nindeed have failed me; and I must esteem myself but lightly if I\ncannot control my eyes and make them look elsewhere. By so doing\nI shall be able to guard myself right well from Love, who wishes\nto be my master. What the eye sees not the heart does not lament.\nIf I do not see him there will be no pain. He does not entreat or\nseek me: if he had loved me he would have sought me. And since he\nneither loves nor esteems me, shall I love him if he loves me\nnot? If his beauty draws my eyes, and my eyes obey the spell,\nshall I for that say I love him? Nay, for that would be a lie. By\ndrawing my eyes he has done me no wrong of which I can complain;\nand I can bring no charge at all against him. One cannot love\nwith the eyes. And what wrong, then, have my eyes done to me if\nthey gaze on what I will to look at? What fault and wrong do they\ncommit? Ought I to blame them? Nay. Whom, then? Myself, who have\nthem in my keeping? My eye looks on nought unless it pleases and\ndelights my heart. My heart could not wish for aught that would\nmake me sorrowful. It is my heart's will that makes me sorrow.\nSorrow? Faith, then, am I mad? since through my heart I desire\nthat which makes me mad. I ought, indeed, if I can to rid myself\nof a will whence grief may come to me. If I can? Fool, what have\nI said? Then were I weak indeed if I had no power over myself.\nDoes Love think to put me in the way which is wont to mislead\nother folk? Thus may he lead others; but I am not his at all.\nNever shall I be so; never was I so; never shall I desire his\nfurther acquaintance.\" Thus she disputes with herself, one hour\nloves and another hates. She is in such doubt that she does not\nknow which side to take. She thinks she is defending herself\nagainst Love; but she is in no need of defence. God! Why does she\nnot know that the thoughts of Alexander, on his side, are\ndirected towards her? Love deals out to them impartially such a\nportion as is meet for each. He gives to them many a reason and\nground that the one should love and desire the other. This love\nwould have been loyal and right if the one had known what was the\nwill of the other; but he does not know what she desires, nor\nshe, for what he is lamenting. The queen watches them and sees\nthe one and the other often lose colour and grow pale and sigh\nand shudder; but she knows not why they do it unless it be on\naccount of the sea on which they are sailing. Perhaps, indeed,\nshe would have perceived it if the sea had not misled her; but it\nis the sea which baffles and deceives her so that amid the\nsea-sickness she sees not the heart-sickness. For they are at\nsea, and heart-sickness is the cause of their plight, and\nheart-bitterness is the cause of the malady that grips them; but\nof these three the queen can only blame the sea; for\nheart-sickness and heart-bitterness lay the blame on the\nsea-sickness; and because of the third the two who are guilty get\noff scot-free. He who is guiltless of fault or wrong often pays\ndear for the sin of another. Thus the queen violently accuses the\nsea and blames it; but wrongly is the blame laid on the sea, for\nthe sea has done therein no wrong. Much sorrow has Soredamors\nborne ere the ship has come to port. The king's coming is noised\nabroad; for the Bretons had great joy thereof and served him\nright willingly as their lawful lord. I seek not to speak more at\nlength of King Arthur at this time: rather shall ye hear me tell\nhow Love torments the two lovers against whom he has taken the\nfield.\n\nAlexander loves and desires her who is sighing for his love; but\nhe knows not, and will not know aught of this until he shall have\nsuffered many an ill and many a grief. For love of her he serves\nthe queen and the ladies of her chamber; but he does not dare to\nspeak to or address her who is most in his mind. If she had dared\nto maintain against him the right which she thinks is hers in the\nmatter, willingly would he have told him of it; but she neither\ndares nor ought to do so. And the fact that the one sees the\nother, and that they dare not speak or act, turns to great\nadversity for them; and love grows thereby and burns. But it is\nthe custom of all lovers that they willingly feed their eyes on\nlooks if they can do no better, and think that because the source\nwhence their love buds and grows delights them therefore it must\nhelp their case, whereas it injures them: just as the man who\napproaches and comes close to the fire burns himself more than\nthe man who draws back from it. Their love grows and increases\ncontinually; but the one feels shame before the other; and each\nconceals and hides this love so that neither flame nor smoke is\nseen from the gleed beneath the ashes. But the heat is none the\nless for that; rather the heat lasts longer below the gleed than\nabove it. Both the lovers are in very great anguish; for in order\nthat their complaint may not be known or perceived, each must\ndeceive all men by false pretence; but in the night great is the\nplaint which each makes in solitude.\n\nFirst will I tell you of Alexander: how he complains and laments.\nLove brings before his mind the lady for whose sake he feels such\nSorrow; for she has robbed him of his heart, and will not let him\nrest in his bed; so much it delights him to recall the beauty and\nthe mien of her as to whom he dare not hope that ever joy of her\nmay fall to his lot. \"I may hold myself a fool,\" quoth he. \"A\nfool? Truly am I a fool, since I do not dare to say what I think;\nfor quickly would it turn to my bane. I have set my thought on\nfolly. Then is it not better for me to meditate in silence than\nto get myself dubbed a fool? Never shall my desire be known. And\nshall I hide the cause of my grief, and not dare to seek help or\nsuccour for my sorrows? He who is conscious of weakness is a fool\nif he does not seek that by which he may have health if he can\nfind it anywhere; but many a one thinks to gain his own advantage\nand to win what he desires, who pursues that whereof he sorrows\nlater. And why should he go to seek advice when he does not\nexpect to find health? That were a vain toil! I feel my own ill\nso heavy a burden that never shall I find healing for it by\nmedicine or by potion or by herb or by root. There is not a\nremedy for every ill: mine is so rooted that it cannot be cured.\nCannot? Methinks I have lied. As soon as I first felt this evil,\nif I had dared to reveal and to tell it, I could have spoken to a\nleech, who could have helped me in the whole matter; but it is\nvery grievous for me to speak out. Perhaps they would not deign\nto listen and would refuse to accept a fee. No wonder is it then\nif I am dismayed, for I have a great ill; and yet I do not know\nwhat ill it is which sways me nor do I know whence comes this\npain. I do not know? Yes, indeed, I think I know; Love makes me\nfeel this evil. How? Does Love, then, know how to do evil? Is he\nnot kind and debonair? I thought that there would have been\nnought in Love which was not good; but I have found him very\nmalicious. He who has not put him to the test knows not with what\ngames Love meddles. He is a fool who goes to meet him; for always\nhe wishes to burden his subjects. Faith! his game is not at all a\ngood one. It is ill playing with him; for his sport will cause me\nsorrow. What shall I do, then? Shall I draw back I think that\nthis would be the act of a wise man; but I cannot tell how to set\nabout it. If Love chastises and threatens in order to teach me\nhis lesson, ought I to disdain my master? He who despises his\nmaster is a fool. Needs must I store up in my mind Love's lesson\nfor soon can great good come of it. But he buffets me greatly:\nthat sets me in alarm! True, neither blow nor wound is visible\nand yet dost thou complain? Then art thou not wrong? Nay, indeed,\nfor he has wounded me so sore that he has winged his arrow even\nto my heart; and not yet has he drawn it out again. How then has\nhe struck his dart into thy body when no wound appears without?\nThis shalt thou tell me; I would fain know it. In what member has\nhe struck thee? Through the eye. Through the eye? And yet he has\nnot put out thine eye? He has done me no hurt in the eye; but he\nwounds me sorely at the heart. Now speak reason to me: how has\nthe dart passed through thine eye in such wise that the eye is\nnot wounded or bruised by it? If the dart enter through the midst\nof the eye, why does my heart suffer pain in my body? Why does\nnot my eye also feel the pain, since it receives the first blow?\nThat can I well explain. The eye has no care to understand aught\nnor can it do anything in the matter in any way; but the eye is\nthe mirror to the heart, and through this mirror passes the fire\nby which the heart is kindled; yet so that it neither wounds nor\nbraises it. Then is not the heart placed in the body like the\nlighted candle which is put inside the lantern? If you take the\ncandle out, never will any light issue thence; but as long as the\ncandle lasts the lantern is not dark; and the flame which shines\nthrough neither harms nor injures it. Likewise is it with regard\nto a window: never will it be so strong and so whole but that the\nray of the sun may pass through it without hurting it in any way;\nand the glass will never be so clear that one will see any better\nfor its brightness if another brightness does not strike upon it.\nKnow that it is the same with the eyes as with the glass and the\nlantern; for the light penetrates into the eyes, the heart's\nmirror; and the heart sees the object outside whatever it be, and\nsees many various objects, some green, others dark of hue, one\ncrimson, the other blue; and it blames the one and praises the\nother, holds the one cheap and the other precious; but many an\nobject shows him a fair face in the mirror when he looks at it,\nwhich will betray him if he be not on his guard. My mirror has\nmuch deceived me; for in it MY heart has seen a ray by which I am\nstruck, which has taken shelter in me; and because of this my\nheart has failed me. I am ill-treated by my friend who deserts me\nfor my enemy. Well can I accuse my mirror of treachery; for it\nhas sinned exceedingly against me. I thought I  had three\nfriends: my heart and my two eyes together; but methinks they\nhate me. Where shall I find any more a friend, since these three\nare enemies who belong to me yet kill me? My servants presume\novermuch who do all their own will and have no care of mine. Now,\nknow I well of a truth from the action of those who have injured\nme: that a good master's love decays through keeping bad\nservants. He who associates with a bad servant cannot fail to\nlament it sooner or later, whatever come of it.\n\n\"Now will I speak to you again of the arrow which is given in\ntrust to me and tell you how it is made and cut; but I fear much\nthat I may fail in the matter; for the carved work of it is so\nmagnificent that twill be no marvel if I fail. And yet I will\napply all my diligence to say what I think of it. The notch and\nthe feathers together are so close that if a man looks well at\nthem there is but one dividing line like a narrow parting in the\nhair; but this line is so polished and straight, that without\nquestion there is nought in the notch which can be improved. The\nfeathers are of such a hue as if they were gold or gilded; but\ngilding can add nothing; for the feathers, this know I well, were\nbrighter still than gold. The feathers are the blonde tresses\nthat I saw the other day at sea. This is the arrow that makes me\nlove. God! What a priceless boon! If a man could have such a\ntreasure, why should he desire any other wealth all his life? For\nmy part, I could swear that I should desire nothing more; for\nmerely the feathers and the notch would I not give away in\nexchange for Antioch. And since I prize these two things so much,\nwho could duly appraise the value of the rest which is so fair\nand lovable, and so dear and so precious, that I am desirous and\neager to behold myself mirrored again in the brow that God has\nmade so bright that nor mirror nor emerald nor topaz would make\nany show beside it. But of all this, he who gazes at the\nbrightness of the eyes has not a word to say; for to all those\nwho behold them they seem two glowing candles. And who has so\nglib a tongue that he could describe the fashion of the\nwell-shaped nose, and of the bright countenance where the rose\noverlays the lily so that it eclipses something of the lily in\norder the better to illuminate the face, and of the smiling\nlittle mouth which God made such on purpose that no one should\nsee it and not think that it is laughing? And what of the teeth\nin her mouth? One is so close to the other that it seems that\nthey all touch, and so that they might the better achieve this,\nNature bestowed special pains, so that whoever should see them\nwhen the mouth opens would never dream that they were not of\nivory or silver. So much there is to say and to recount in the\ndescribing of each thing--both of the chin and of the ears--that\nit would be no great marvel if I were to leave out something. Of\nthe throat, I tell you, that in comparison with it, crystal is\nbut dim. And the neck beneath her tresses is four times whiter\nthan ivory. As much as is disclosed from the hem of the vest\nbehind, to the clasp of the opening in front, saw I of the bare\nbosom uncovered, whiter, than is the new-fallen snow. My pain\nwould indeed have been alleviated if I could have seen the whole\nof the arrow. Right willingly if I had known would I have said\nwhat the tip  of the arrow is like: I did not see it; and it is\nnot my own fault if I cannot tell the fashion of a thing that I\nhave not seen. Love showed me then nought of it except the notch\nand the feathers; for the arrow was put in the quiver; the quiver\nis the tunic and the vest wherewith the maid was clad. Faith!\nThis is the wound that kills me; this is the dart; this is the\nray with which I am so cruelly inflamed. It is ignoble of me to\nbe angry. Never for provocation or for war shall any pledge that\nI must seek of love be broken. Now let Love dispose of me as he\nought to do with what is his; for I wish it, and this is my\npleasure. Never do I seek that this malady should leave me;\nrather do I wish it to hold me thus for ever; and that from none\nmay health come to me if health come not from that source whence\nthe disease has come.\"\n\nGreat is the plaint of Alexander; but that which the damsel\nutters is not a whit less. All night she is in so great pain that\nshe neither sleeps nor rests. Love has set in array within her a\nbattle that rages and mightily agitates her heart; and which\ncauses such anguish and torture that she weeps all night and\ncomplains and tosses and starts up, so that her heart all but\nstops beating. And when she has so grieved and sobbed and moaned\nand started and sighed, then she has looked in her heart to see\nwho and of what worth was he for whose sake Love was torturing\nher. And when she has recalled each wandering thought, then she\nstretches herself and turns over; and turning, she turns to folly\nall the thinking she has done. Then she starts on another\nargument and says: \"Fool! What does it matter to me if this youth\nis debonair and wise and courteous and valiant! All this is\nhonour and advantage to him. And what care I for his beauty? Let\nhis beauty depart with him--and so it will, for all I can do;\nnever would I wish to take away aught of it. Take away? Nay,\ntruly, that do I not assuredly. If he had the wisdom of Solomon,\nand if Nature had put so much beauty in him that she could not\nhave put more in a human body, and if God had put in my hand the\npower to destroy all, I would not seek to anger him; but\nwillingly if I could would I make him more wise and more\nbeautiful. Faith! then, I do not hate him at all. And am I then\non that account his lady? No, indeed, no more than I am\nanother's. And wherefore do I think more of him if he does not\nplease me more than another? I know not: I am all bewildered, for\nnever did I think so much about any man living in the world. And\nif I had my wish I should see him always; never would I seek to\ntake my eyes off him so much the sight of him delights me. Is\nthis love? Methinks it is. Never should I have called on him so\noften if I had not loved him more than another. Yes, I love him:\nlet that be granted. And shall I not have my desire? Yes,\nprovided that I find favour in his eyes. This desire is wrong;\nbut Love has taken such hold of me that I am foolish and dazed\nand to defend myself avails me nought herein; thus I must suffer\nLove's attack. I have indeed guarded myself thus wisely and for\nlong against Love; never once before did I wish to do aught for\nhim, but now I am too gracious to him. And what thanks does he\nowe me, since he cannot have service or kindness of me by fair\nmeans? It is by force that Love has tamed my pride; and I must\nneeds be subject to his will. Now I wish to love; now I am under\nhis tuition; now will Love teach me. And what? How I ought to\nserve him. Of that am I right well apprised. I am full wise in\nhis service, for no one could find fault with me in this matter.\nNo need is there henceforth for me to learn more. Love would have\nme, and I would fain be wise without pride, gracious and\ncourteous towards all, but the true love of one only. Shall I\nlove them all for the sake of one? A fair mien should I show to\neach; but Love does not bid me to be a true love to every man.\nLove teaches nought but good. It is not for nothing that I have\nthis name, and that I am called Soredamors. I ought to love, and\nI ought to be loved, and I wish to prove it by my name, if I can\nfind fitting arguments. It is not without meaning that the first\npart of my name is the colour of gold; for the most beautiful are\nthe blondest. Therefore I hold my name the fairer because it\nbegins with the colour with which accords the finest gold. And\nthe end recalls Love; for he who calls me by my right name ever\ncalls Love to my mind. And the one half gilds the other with\nbright and yellow gilding; for Soredamors means the same thing as\n'gilded with love'. Much, then, has Love honoured me, since he\nhas gilded me with himself. Gilding of gold is not so fine as\nthat which illumines me. And I shall set my care on this, that I\nmay be of his gilding; nevermore will I complain of him. Now I\nlove and shall always love. Whom? Truly, a fine question! Him\nwhom Love bids me love; for no other shall ever have my love.\nWhat does it matter as he will never know it unless I tell him\nmyself? What shall I do if I do not pray him for his love? For he\nwho desires a thing ought indeed to request and pray for it. How?\nShall I then pray him? Nay, indeed. Why not? It never happened\nthat a woman did aught so witless as to beg a man for love unless\nshe were more than common mad. I should be convicted of folly if\nI said with my mouth aught that might turn to my reproach. If he\nshould know it from my mouth, I deem that he would hold me the\ncheaper for it, and would often reproach me with having been the\nfirst to pray for love. Never be Love so abased that I should go\nand entreat this man, since he would be bound to hold me the\ncheaper for it. Ah God! how will he ever know it, since I shall\nnot tell him? As yet I have scarce suffered aught for which I\nneed so distress myself. I shall wait till he perceives it, if he\nis ever destined to perceive it. He will know it well of a truth,\nI think, if ever he had aught to do with Love or heard tell of it\nby word of mouth. Heard tell! Now have I said foolish words.\nLove's lore is not so easy that a man becomes wise by speaking of\nit unless good experience be there too. Of myself I know this\nwell; for never could I learn aught of it by fair speaking or by\nword of mouth; and yet I have been much at Love's school, and\nhave often been flattered; but always have I kept aloof from him,\nand now he makes me pay dear for it; for now I know more of it\nthan an ox does of ploughing. But of this I despair--that he\nnever loved, perhaps, and if he does not love, and has not\nloved; then have I been sowing in the sea where no seed can take\nroot; and there is nothing for it but to wait for him and to\nsuffer till I see whether I can bring him into the right way by\nhints and covert words. I will so act that he will be certain of\nhaving my love if he dares to seek it. Thus the end of the whole\nmatter is that I love him and am his. If he does not love me, I\nshall love him all the same.\"\n\nThus both he and she complain, and the one hides the case from\nthe other; they have sorrow in the night and worse by day. In\nsuch pain they have, it seems to me, been a long while in\nBrittany until it came to the end of summer. Right at the\nbeginning of October came messengers from the parts about Dover\nfrom London and from Canterbury to bring the king tidings that\nhave troubled his heart. The messengers have told him this--that\nhe may well tarry too long in Brittany; for he to whom he had\nentrusted his land, and had consigned so great a host of his\nsubjects and of his friends, will now set himself in battle array\nagainst the king; and he has marched into London in order to hold\nthe city against the hour that Arthur should have returned.\n\nWhen the king heard the news he calls all his barons; for he was\nindignant and full of displeasure. That he may the better stir\nthem up to confound the traitor, he says that all the blame for\nhis toil and for his war is theirs; for through their persuasion\nhe gave his land and put it into the hand of the traitor who is\nworse than Ganelon. There is not one who does not quite allow\nthat the king has right and reason; for they all counselled him\nto do so; but the traitor will be ruined for it. And let him know\nwell of a truth that in no castle or city will he be able so to\nprotect his body that they do not drag him out of it by force.\nThus they all assure the king and solemnly affirm and swear that\nthey will give up the traitor or no longer hold their lands. And\nthe king has it proclaimed through all Brittany that none who can\nbear arms in the host remain in the country without coming after\nhim quickly.\n\nAll Brittany is moved: never was such a host seen as King Arthur\nassembled. When the ships moved out it seemed that everybody in\nthe world was on the sea; for not even the waves were seen, so\ncovered were they with ships. This fact is certain, that it seems\nfrom the stir that all Brittany is taking ship. Now have the\nships made the passage; and the folk who have thronged together\ngo into quarters along the shore. It came into Alexander's heart\nto go and beg the king to make him a knight; for if ever he is to\nwin renown he will win it in this war. He takes his comrades with\nhim, as his will urges him on to do what he has purposed. They\nhave gone to the king's tent: the king was sitting before his\ntent. When he sees the Greeks coming he has called them before\nhim. \"Sirs,\" quoth he, \"hide not from me what need brought you\nhere.\" Alexander spoke for all and has told him his desire: \"I am\ncome,\" quoth he, \"to pray you as I am bound to pray, my lord, for\nmy companions and for myself, that you make us knights.\" The king\nreplies: \"Right gladly; and not a moment's delay shall there be,\nsince you have made me this request.\" Then the king bids there be\nborne harness for twelve knights: done is what the king commands.\nEach asks for his own harness; and each has his own in his\npossession, fair arms and a good steed: each one has taken his\nharness. All the twelve were of like value, arms and apparel and\nhorse; but the harness for Alexander's body was worth as much--if\nany one had cared to value or to sell it--as the arms of all the\nother twelve together. Straightway by the sea they disrobed and\nwashed and bathed; for they neither wished nor deigned that any\nother bath should be heated for them. They made the sea their\nbath and tub.\n\nThe queen, who does not hate Alexander--rather does she love and\npraise and prize him much--hears of the matter. She wills to do\nhim a great service; it is far greater than she thinks. She\nsearches and empties all her chests till she has drawn forth a\nshirt of white silk very well wrought very delicate and very\nfine. There was no thread in the seams that was not of gold, or\nat the least of silver. Soredamors from time to time had set her\nhands to the sewing, and had in places sewn in beside the gold a\nhair from her head, both on the two sleeves and on the collar to\nsee and to put to the test whether she could ever find a man who\ncould distinguish the one from the other, however carefully he\nlooked at it; for the hair was as shining and as golden as the\ngold or even more so. The queen takes the shirt and has given it\nto Alexander. Ah God! how great joy would Alexander have had if\nhe had known what the queen is sending him. Very great joy would\nshe too have had, who had sewn her hair there if she had known\nthat her love was to have and wear it. Much comfort would she\nhave had thereof; for she would not have loved all the rest of\nher hair so much as that which Alexander had. But neither he nor\nshe knew it: great pity is it that they do not know. To the\nharbour where the youths are washing came the messenger of the\nqueen; he finds the youths on the beach and has given the shirt\nto him, who is much delighted with it and who held it all the\ndearer for that it came from the queen. But if he had known the\nwhole case he would have loved it still more; for he would not\nhave taken all the world in exchange, but rather he would have\ntreated it as a relic, I think, and would have worshipped it day\nand night.\n\nAlexander delays no longer to apparel himself straightway. When\nhe was clad and equipped he has returned to the tent of the king;\nand all his comrades together with him. The queen, as I think,\nhad come to sit in the tent because she wished to see the new\nknights arrive. Well might one esteem them fair; but fairest of\nall was Alexander with the agile body. They are now knights; for\nthe present I say no more about them. Henceforth shall I speak of\nthe king and of the host which came to London. The greater part\nof the folk held to his side; but there is a great multitude of\nthem against him. Count Engres musters his troops, all that he\ncan win over to him by promise or by gift. When he had got his\nmen together he has secretly fled by night; for he was hated by\nseveral and feared to be betrayed; but before he fled he took\nfrom London as much as he could of victuals of gold and of\nsilver, and distributed it all to his folk. The tidings is told\nto the king--that the traitor is fled, and all his  army with\nhim, and that he had taken so much of victuals and goods from the\ncity that the burgesses are impoverished and destitute and at a\nloss. And the king has replied just this: that never will he take\nransom of the traitor, but will hang him if he can find or take\nhim. Now all the host bestirs itself so much that they reached\nWindsor. At that day, however it be now, if any one wished to\ndefend the castle, it would not have been easy to take; for the\ntraitor enclosed it as soon as he planned the treason with treble\nwalls and moats, and had strengthened the walls behind with\nsharpened stakes, so that they should not be thrown down by any\nsiege-engine. He had spent great sums in strengthening it all\nJune and July and August, in making walls, and bastions, and\nmoats, and drawbridges, trenches, and\nbreast-works, and barriers, and many a portcullis of iron, and a\ngreat tower of stones, hewn foursquare. Never had he shut the\ngate there for fear of attack. The castle stands on a high hill\nand below it runs Thames. The host is encamped on the river bank;\non  that day they had time for nought save encamping and pitching\ntheir tents.\n\nThe host has encamped on Thames: all the meadow is covered with\ntents, green and vermilion. The sun strikes on the colours and\nthe river reflects their sheen for more than a full league. The\ndefenders of the castle had come to take their pleasure along the\nstrand with their lances only in their hands, their shields\nlocked close in front of them, for they bore no arms but these.\nTo their foes without they made it appear that they feared them\nnot at all inasmuch as they had come unarmed. Alexander, on the\nother side, perceived the knights who go before them, playing a\nknightly game on horseback. Hot is his desire to meet with them;\nand he calls his comrades one after the other by their names:\nfirst Cornix, whom he greatly loved, then the stout Licorides,\nthen Nabunal of Mycenae, and Acoriondes of Athens, and Ferolin of\nSalonica, and Calcedor from towards Africa, Parmenides and\nFrancagel, Torin the Strong, and Pinabel, Nerius, and Neriolis.\n\"Lords,\" quoth he, \"a longing has seized me to go and make with\nlance and with shield acquaintance with those who come to tourney\nbefore us. I see full well that they take us for laggards and\nesteem us lightly--so it seems to me--since they have come here\nall unarmed to tourney before our faces. We have been newly\ndubbed knights; we have not yet shown our mettle to knights or at\nquintain. Too long have we kept our new lances virgin. Why were\nour shields made? Not yet have they been pierced or broken. Such\na gift avails us nought save for tour or for assault. Let us pass\nthe ford, and let us attack them.\" All say: \"We will not fail\nyou.\" Each one says: \"So may God save me, as I am not the man to\nfail you here.\" Now they gird on their swords, saddle and girth\ntheir steeds, mount and take their shields. When they had hung\nthe shields from their necks, and taken the lances blazoned in\nquarterings; they all at once rush on to the ford; and the enemy\nlower their lances and ride quickly to strike them. But Alexander\nand his comrades knew well how to pay them back; and they neither\nspare them nor shirk nor yield a foot before them; rather each\nstrikes his own foe so doughtily that there is no knight so good\nbut he must void his saddle-bow. The Greeks did not take them for\nboys for cowards or for men bewildered. They have not wasted\ntheir first blows; for they have unhorsed thirteen. The noise of\ntheir blows and strokes has reached as far as to the army. In a\nshort time the melee would have been desperate, if the enemy had\ndared to stand before them. The king's men run through the host\nto take their weapons, and dash into the water noisily, and the\nenemy turn to flight; for they see that it is not good to stay\nthere. And the Greeks follow them, striking with lances and\nswords. Many heads there were cut open; but of the Greeks there\nwas not a single one wounded. They have proved themselves well\nthat day. But Alexander won the greatest distinction; for he\nleads away four knights bound to his person and taken prisoners.\nAnd the dead lie on the strand; for many there lay headless, and\nmany wounded and maimed.\n\nAlexander from courtesy gives and presents the first fruits of\nhis  knighthood to the queen. He does not wish that the king\nshould have possession of the captives; for he would have had\nthem all hanged. The queen has had them taken and has had them\nguarded in prison as accused of treason. Men speak of the Greeks\nthroughout the army; all say that Alexander is right courteous\nand debonair as regards the knights whom he had taken inasmuch as\nhe had not given them up to the king, who would have had them\nburned or hanged. But the king is in earnest in the matter.\nForthwith he bids the queen that she come and speak to him and\nkeep not her traitors; for it will behove her to give them up or\nhe will take them against her will. Then the queen has come to\nthe king; they have had converse together about the traitors as\nit behoved them; and all the Greeks had been left in the queen's\ntent with the ladies. Much do the twelve say to them, but\nAlexander does not say a word. Soredamors observed it; she had\nsat down near him. He has rested his cheek on his hand, and it\nseems that he is deep in thought. Thus have they sat full long\ntill Soredamors saw on his arm and at his neck the hair with\nwhich she had made the seam. She has drawn a little nearer him,\nfor now she has opportunity of speaking with him; but she\nconsiders beforehand how she can be the one to speak, and what\nthe first word shall be; whether she will call him by his name;\nand she takes counsel of it with herself. \"What shall I say\nfirst?\" thinks she. \"Shall I address him by his name, or as\n'friend'. Friend? Not I. How then? Call him by his name? God! The\nword friend is so fair and so sweet to say. What if I dared to\ncall him friend? Dared? What forbids it me? The fact that I think\nI should be telling a lie. A lie? I know not what it will be; but\nif I lie it will be a weight on my mind. For that reason it must\nbe allowed that I should not desire to lie in the matter. God! He\nwould not lie now a whit if he called me his sweet friend. And\nshould I lie in so calling him? Both of us ought indeed to speak\ntruth; but if I lie the wrong will be his. And why is his name so\nhard to me that I wish to add a name of courtesy? It seems to me\nthere are too many letters in it, and I should become tongue-tied\nin the middle. But if I called him friend, I should very quickly\nsay this name. But just because I fear to stumble in the other\nname, I would have given of my heart's-blood if only his name\nmight have been 'my sweet friend'.\"\n\nShe delays so long in thus thinking that the queen returns from\nthe king, who had sent for her. Alexander sees her coming, and\ngoes to meet her, and asks her what the king commands to be done\nwith his prisoners, and what will be their fate. \"Friend,\" says\nshe, \"he requires me to yield them up to his discretion and to\nlet him do his justice on them. He is very wroth that I have not\nyet given them up to him and I must send them; for I see no other\nway out.\" Thus they have passed this day; and on the morrow the\ngood and loyal knights have assembled together before the royal\ntent to pronounce justice and judgment as to with what penalty\nand with what torture the four traitors should die. Some doom\nthat they be flayed, others that they be hanged or burnt, and the\nking himself deems that traitors should be drawn. Then he bids\nthem be brought: they are brought; he has them bound, and tells\nthem that they shall not be quartered till they are in view of\nthe castle, so that those within shall see them. When the parley\nis done, the king addresses Alexander and calls him his dear\nfriend. \"Friend,\" quoth he, \"I saw you yesterday make a fair\nattack and a fair defence. I will give you the due guerdon: I\nincrease your following by 500 Welsh knights and by 1000 footmen\nof this land. When I shall have finished my war, in addition to\nwhat I have given you, I will have you crowned king of the best\nrealm in Wales. Market-towns and strong castles, cities and\nhalls, will I give you, meanwhile, till the land shall be given\nto you which your father holds and of which you must become\nemperor.\" Alexander heartily thanks the king for this grant; and\nhis comrades thank him likewise. All the barons of the Court say\nthat the honour which the king designs for him is well vested in\nAlexander.\n\nWhen Alexander sees his men his comrades and his footmen, such as\nthe king willed to give him, then they begin to sound horns and\ntrumpets throughout the host. Good and bad all, I would have you\nknow, without exception take their arms, those of Wales and of\nBrittany of Scotland and of Cornwall; for from all sides without\nfail strong reinforcements had come in for the host. Thames had\nshrunk; for there had been no rain all the summer; rather there\nhad been such a drought that the fish in it were dead and the\nships leaky in the harbour; and one could pass by the ford there\nwhere the water was widest of a hair and has delight and joyaunce\nthereof; but the host has crossed Thames; some beset the valley\nand others mount the height. The defenders of the castle perceive\nit, and see coming the wondrous host which is preparing outside\nto overthrow and take the castle; and they prepare to defend it.\nBut before any attack is made the king has the traitors dragged\nby four horses round the castle, through the valleys, and over\nmounds and hillocks. Count Engres is sore grieved when he sees\nthose whom he held dear dragged round his castle; and the others\nwere much dismayed; but for all the dismay that they feel thereat\nthey have no desire to surrender. Needs must they defend\nthemselves; for the king displays openly to all his displeasure\nand his wrath; and full well they see that if he held them he\nwould make them die shamefully.\n\nWhen the four had been drawn and their limbs lay o'er the field,\nthen the attack begins; but all their toil is vain; for howsoever\nthey may hurl and throw their missiles, they can avail nought.\nAnd yet they try hard; they throw and hurl a thick cloud of bolts\nand javelins and darts. The catapults and slings make a great din\non all sides; arrows and round stone fly likewise in confusion as\nthick as rain mingled with hail. Thus they toil all day: these\ndefend, and those attack until night separates them, one from the\nother, nor need they trouble to flee, nor do they see. And the\nking on his part has it cried through the host and made known\nwhat gift that man will have of him by whom the castle shall have\nbeen taken: a goblet of very great price, worth fifteen golden\nmarks, the richest in his treasure, will he give him. The goblet\nwill be very fair and rich; and he whose judgement goes not\nastray ought to hold it dearer for the workmanship than for the\nmaterial. The goblet is very precious in workmanship, and if I\nwere to disclose the whole truth, the jewels on the outside were\nworth more than the workmanship or the gold. If he by whom the\ncastle will be taken is but a foot soldier, he shall have the\ncup. And if it is taken by a knight, never shall he seek any\nreward besides the cup; but he will have it if it can be found in\nthe world. When this matter was proclaimed Alexander, who went\neach evening to see the queen, had not forgotten his custom. On\nthis evening he had again gone thither; they were seated side by\nside, both Alexander and the queen. Before them Soredamors was\nsitting alone nearest to them; and she looked at him as gladly as\nthough she would not have preferred to be in Paradise. The queen\nheld Alexander by his right hand, and looked at the golden thread\nwhich had become greatly tarnished; and the hair was becoming yet\nfairer whereas the gold thread was growing pale; and she\nremembered by chance that Soredamors had done the stitching and\nshe laughed thereat. Alexander observed it and asks her, if it\nmay be told, to tell him what makes her laugh. The queen delays\nto tell him, and looks towards Soredamors, and has called her\nbefore her. She has come very gladly and kneels before her.\nAlexander was much joyed when he saw her approach so near that he\ncould have touched her; but he has not so much courage as to dare\neven to look at her; but all his senses have so left him that he\nhas almost become dumb. And she, on the other hand, is so\nbewildered that she has no use of her eyes, but fixes her gaze on\nthe ground, and dares not direct it elsewhere. The queen greatly\nmarvels; she sees her now pale, now flushed, and notes well in\nher heart the bearing and appearance of each and of the two\ntogether. She sees clearly and truly, it seems to her, judging by\nthe changes of colour, that these are signs of love; but she does\nnot wish to cause them anguish: she feigns to know nothing of\nwhat she sees. She did just what it behoved her to do; for she\ngave no look or hint save that she said to the maiden: \"Damsel,\nlook yonder and tell--hide it not from us--where the shirt that\nthis knight has donned was sewn, and whether you had a hand in\nit, and put in it somewhat of yours?\" The maiden is ashamed to\nsay it; nevertheless, she tells it to him gladly; for she wishes\nthat he should hear the truth; and he has such joy of hearing it\nwhen she tells and describes to him the making of the shirt, that\nwith great difficulty he restrains himself when he sees the hair\nfrom worshipping and doing reverence to it. His comrades and the\nqueen, who were there with him, cause him great distress and\nannoyance; for on account of them he refrains from raising it to\nhis eyes and to his lips where he would fain have pressed it if\nhe had not thought that they would see him. He is blithe that he\nhas so much of his lady-love; but he does not think or expect to\nhave ever any other boon of her. His desire makes him fear;\nnevertheless, when he is alone he kisses it more than a hundred\nthousand times when he has left the queen. Now it seems to him\nthat he was born in a lucky hour. Very great joy does he have of\nit all night, but he takes good care that no one sees him. When\nhe has lain down in his bed, he delights and consoles him self\nfruitlessly with that in which there is no delight; all night he\nembraces the shirt, and when he beholds the hair he thinks he is\nlord of all the world. Truly Love makes a wise man a fool: since\nhe has joy, he will change his pastime before the bright dawn and\nthe sunlight. The traitors are holding counsel as to what they\nwill be able to do and what will become of them. Long time they\nwill be able to defend the castle; that is a certainty if they\napply themselves to the defence; but they know that the king is\nof so fierce a courage that in all his life he will never turn\naway until he has taken it; then they must needs die. And if they\nsurrender the castle they expect no grace for that. Thus the one\nlot or the other; it has fallen out ill for them; for they have\nno reinforcement, and they see death on all sides. But the end of\ntheir deliberation is that to-morrow, before day appears, they\nresolve to issue forth secretly from the castle, and to fall on\nthe host unarmed, and the knights asleep, since they will still\nbe lying in their beds. Before these have awakened, apparelled\nand equipped, themselves, they will have made such slaughter that\never hereafter shall be related the battle of that night. To this\nplan all the traitors cling from desperation, for they have no\nconfidence as to their lives. Lack of hope as to the outcome\nemboldens them to the battle, for they see no issue for\nthemselves except through death or prison. Such an issue is no\nwholesome one, nor need they trouble to flee, nor do they see\nwhere they could find refuge if they should have fled; for the\nsea and their enemies are around them, and they in the midst. No\nlonger do they tarry at their council: now they apparel and arm\nthemselves, and issue forth towards the north-west by an ancient\npostern towards that side whence they thought that those of the\nhost would least expect to see them come. In serried ranks they\nsallied forth: of their men they made five battalions; and there\nwere no less than two thousand foot-soldiers well equipped for\nbattle and a thousand knights in each. This night neither star\nnor moon had shown its rays in the sky; but before they had\nreached the tents the moon began to rise, and, I believe that\njust to vex them, it rose earlier than it was wont; and God who\nwished to injure them lit up the dark night, for He had no care\nof their army; rather He hated them for their sin with which they\nwere tainted for traitors and treason which God hates more than\nany other crime; so the moon began to shine because it was doomed\nto injure them.\n\nThe moon was veritably hostile to them; for it shone on their\nglittering shields; and the helmets likewise greatly embarrass\nthem, for they reflect the light of the moon for the sentries who\nwere set to guard the host see them; and they cry throughout all\nthe host: \"Up, knights! Up, rise quickly! Take your arms, arm\nyourselves! Behold the traitors upon us!\" Through all the host\nthey spring to arms; they rouse themselves and don with haste\ntheir harness, as men must do in case of stress. Never did a\nsingle one of them stir forth till they were fully equipped; and\nall mounted on their steeds. While they are arming, the enemy, on\nthe other hand, who greatly desire the battle, are bestirring\nthemselves, so that they may take them unawares and likewise find\nthem unarmed; and they send forth their men whom they had divided\ninto five bands. Some kept beside the wood; others came along the\nriver; the third placed themselves in the plain; and the fourth\nwere in a valley; and the fifth battalion spurs along the moat\nthat surrounded a rock, for they thought to swoop down\nimpetuously among the tents. But they have not found a road that\nthey could follow, or a way that was not barred; for the king's\nmen block their way as they very proudly defy them and reproach\nthem with treason. They engage with the iron heads of their\nlances, so that they splinter and break them; they come to close\nquarters with swords; and champion strikes champion to the ground\nand makes him bite the dust; each side strikes down its foes, and\nas fiercely as lions devouring whatsoever they can seize rush on\ntheir prey; so fiercely do they rush on their foe--aye, and more\nfiercely. On both sides, of a truth, there was very great loss of\nlife at that first attack; but reinforcements come for the\ntraitors, who defend themselves very fiercely, and sell their\nlives dear when they can keep them no longer. On four sides they\nsee their battalions coming to succour them; and the king's men\ngallop upon them as fast as they can spur. They rush to deal them\nsuch blows on the shields, that together with the wounded they\nhave overthrown more than five hundred of them. The Greeks spare\nthem not at all. Alexander is not idle, for he exerts himself to\nact bravely. In the thickest of the fray he rushes so impetuously\nto smite a traitor, that neither shield nor hauberk availed one\nwhit to save that traitor from being thrown to the ground. When\nAlexander has made a truce with him forsooth, he pays his\nattentions to another--attentions in which he does not waste or\nlose his pains. He serves him in such valiant sort that he rends\nhis soul from his body; and the house remains without a tenant.\nAfter these two Alexander picks a quarrel with a third: he\nstrikes a right noble court knight through both flanks in such\nwise that the blood gushes out of the wound on the opposite side;\nand the soul takes leave of the body, for the foe man has\nbreathed it forth. Many a one he kills; many a one he maims; for\nlike the forked lightning he attacks all those that he seeks out.\nHim whom he strikes with lance or sword, neither corselet nor\nshield protects. His comrades also are very lavish in spilling\nblood and brains; well do they know how to deal their blows. And\nthe king's men cut down so many that they break and scatter them\nlike common folk distraught. So many dead lie o'er the fields and\nso long has the scour lasted, that the battle-array was broken up\na long while before it was day; and the line of dead down along\nthe river extended five leagues. Count Engres leaves his standard\nin the battle and steals away; and he has taken seven of his\ncompanions together with him. He has returned towards his castle\nby so hidden a way that he thinks that no one sees; but Alexander\nmarks him; for he sees them flee from the host, and thinks to\nsteal away and meet them, so that no one will know where he has\ngone. But before he was in the valley he saw as many as thirty\nknights coming after him along a path, six of whom were Greeks,\nand the other four-and-twenty Welsh; for they thought that they\nwould follow him at a distance until it should come to the pinch.\nWhen Alexander perceived them he stopped to wait, and marks which\nway those who are returning to the castle take until he sees them\nenter. Then he begins to meditate on a very hazardous venture and\non a very wondrous stratagem. And when he had finished all his\nthinking, he turns towards his comrades, and thus has related and\nsaid to them: \"Lords,\" quoth he, \"without gainsaying me, if ye\nwish to have my love, whether it be prompted by folly or wisdom,\ngrant me my wish.\" And they have granted it; for never will they\nrefuse him anything that he may choose to do. \"Let us change our\ninsignia,\" quoth he; \"let us take shields and lances from the\ntraitors that we have slain. Thus we shall go towards the castle,\nand the traitors within will think that we are of their party,\nand whatever the requital may be the doors will be opened to us.\nKnow ye in what wise we shall requite them? We shall take them\nall or dead or living if God grant it us; and  if any of you\nrepent you know that as long as I live, I shall never love him\nwith a good heart.\"\n\nAll grant him his will: they go and seize the shields from the\nDead; and they arrive with this equipment. And the folk of the\ncastle had mounted to the battlements of the tower, for they\nrecognised the shields full well and think that they belong to\ntheir own men; for they were unsuspicious of the ambush which\nlurks beneath the shields. The porter opens the door to them and\nhas received them within. He is so beguiled and deceived that he\ndoes not address them at all; and not one of them breathes a\nword, but they pass on mute and silent, feigning such grief that\nthey drag their lances behind them and bend beneath their\nshields, so that it seems that they are sorrowing greatly; and\nthey go in whatever direction they wish until they have passed\nthe three walls. Up yonder they find so many foot-soldiers and\nknights with the count, I cannot tell you the number of them; but\nthey were all unarmed except the eight alone, who had returned\nfrom the army; and these even were preparing to take off their\narmour. But they might well prove over-hasty; for those who have\ncome upon them up yonder no longer hid themselves, but put their\nsteeds to the gallop. All press on their stirrups and fall upon\nthem and attack them, so that they strike dead thirty-and-one\nbefore they have given the challenge. The traitors are much\ndismayed thereat and cry, \"Betrayed! Betrayed!\" But Alexander and\nhis friends are not confused; for as soon as they find them all\nunarmed they test their swords well there. Even three of those\nwhom they found armed have they so served that they have only\nleft five. Count Engres has rushed forward, and before the eyes\nof all goes to strike Calcedor on his golden shield, so that he\nthrows him to the ground dead. Alexander is much grieved when he\nsees his comrade slain; he well-nigh goes mad with the fury that\ncomes upon him. His reason is dimmed with anger, but his strength\nand courage are doubled, and he goes to strike the count with\nsuch a mighty force that his lance breaks; for willingly, if he\ncould, would he avenge the death of his friend. But the count was\nof great strength, a good and bold knight to boot, such that\nthere would not have been a better in the world if he had not\nbeen disloyal and a traitor. The count, on his side, prepares to\ngive him such a blow that he bends his lance, so that it\naltogether splinters and breaks; but the shield does not break\nand the one knight does not shake the other from his seat any\nmore than he would have shaken a rock, for both were very strong.\nBut the fact that the count was in the wrong mightily vexes and\nweakens him. The one grows furious against the other, and both\nhave drawn their swords, since they had broken their lances. And\nthere would have been no escape if these two champions had wished\nfurther to prolong the fight; one or the other would have had to\ndie forthwith at the end. But the count does not dare to stand\nhis ground, for he sees his men slain around him, who, being\nunarmed, were taken unawares. And the king's men pursue them\nfiercely, and hack and hew, and cleave, and brain them, and call\nthe count a traitor. When he hears himself accused of treason, he\nflees for refuge towards his keep; and his men flee with him. And\ntheir enemies who fiercely rush after take them captive; they let\nnot a single one escape of all those that they catch. They kill\nand slay so many that I do not think that more than seven reached\na place of safety. When the traitors entered the keep, they are\nstayed at the entrance; for their pursuers had followed them so\nclose that their men would have got in if the entrance had been\nopen. The traitors defend themselves well; for they expect\nsuccour from them who were arming in the town below. But by the\nadvice of Nabunal, a Greek who was very wise, the way was held\nagainst the reinforcements, so that they could not come in time,\nfor they had tarried over-long from lukewarmness and indolence.\nUp there into that fortress there was only one single entry; if\nthe Greeks stop up that entrance, they will have no need to fear\nthe coming of any force from which ill may befall them. Nabunal\nbids and exhorts that twenty of them go to defend the outer\ngateway; for easily there might they press in that way to attack\nand overwhelm them--foemen who would do them harm if they had\nstrength and power to do so. \"Let a score of men go to defend the\ngateway, and let the other ten assail the keep from without, so\nthat the count may not shut himself up inside.\" This is what\nNabunal advises: the ten remain in the melee before the entrance\nof the keep; the score go to the gate. They have delayed almost\ntoo long; for they see coming a company, flushed and heated with\ndesire of fighting, in which there were many crossbow-men and\nfoot-soldiers of divers equipment, bearing diverse arms. Some\ncarried light missiles, and others, Danish axes, Turkish lances\nand swords, arrows and darts and javelins. Very heavy would have\nbeen the reckoning that the Greeks would have had to pay,\nperadventure, if this company had come upon them, but they did\nnot come in time. By the wisdom and by the prudence of Nabunal,\nthey forestalled them and kept them without. When the\nreinforcements see that they are shut out, then they remain idle,\nfor they see well that by attacking they will be able to\naccomplish nought in the matter. Then there rises a mourning and\na cry of women and of little children, of old men and of youths,\nso great that if it had thundered from the sky those within the\ncastle would not have heard aught of it. The Greeks greatly\nrejoice thereat; for now they all know of a surety that never by\nany chance will the count escape being taken. They bid four of\nthem mount in haste to the battlements of the wall to see that\nthose without do not from any quarter, by any stratagem or trick,\npress into the castle to attack them. The sixteen have returned\nto the ten who are fighting. Now was it bright daylight, and now\nthe ten had forced their way into the keep, and the count, armed\nwith an axe, had taken his stand beside a pillar where he defends\nhimself right fiercely. He cleaves asunder all who come within\nhis reach. And his followers range themselves near him; in their\nlast day's work they take such good vengeance that they spare not\ntheir strength at all. Alexander's knights lament that there were\nno more than thirteen of them left though even now there were\ntwenty-and-six. Alexander well-neigh raves with fury when he sees\nsuch havoc among his men who are thus killed and wounded, but he\nis not slow to revenge. He has found at hand, by his side, a long\nand heavy beam, and goes to strike therewith a traitor; and\nneither the foeman's shield nor hauberk availed him a whit\nagainst being borne to the ground. After him, he attacks the\ncount; in order to strike well he raises the beam; and he deals\nhim such a blow with his square-hewn beam that the axe falls from\nhis hands; and he was so stunned and so weak, that if he had not\nleaned against the wall his feet would not have supported him.\n\nWith this blow the battle ceases. Alexander leaps towards the\ncount and seizes him in such wise that he cannot move. No need is\nthere to tell more of the others, for easily were they vanquished\nwhen they saw their lord taken. They capture them all with the\ncount and lead them away in dire shame even as they had deserved.\nOf all this, King Arthur's host who were without, knew not a\nword; but in the morning when the battle was ended they had found\ntheir shields among the bodies; and the Greeks were raising a\nvery loud lamentation for their lord but wrongly. On account of\nhis shield which they recognise they one and all make great\nmourning, and swoon over his shield, and say that they have lived\ntoo long. Cornix and Nerius swoon; and when they come to\nthemselves they blame their lives for being yet whole in them.\nAnd so do Torins and Acoriondes; the tears ran in streams from\ntheir eyes right on to their breasts. Life and joy are but\nvexation to them. And above all Parmenides has dishevelled and\ntorn his hair. These five make so great a mourning for their lord\nthat greater there cannot be. But they disquiet themselves in\nvain; instead of him, they are bearing away another; and yet they\nthink that they are bearing away their lord. The other shields\ntoo cause them much sorrow by reason whereof they think that the\nbodies are those of their comrades; and they swoon and lament\nover them. But the shields lie one and all; for of their men\nthere was but one slain who was named, Neriolis. Him truly would\nthey have borne away had they known the truth. But they are in as\ngreat distress about the others as about him; and they have borne\nand taken them all. About all but one they are mistaken; but even\nlike a man who dreams, who believes a lie instead of truth, the\nshields made them believe that this lie was true. They are\ndeceived by the shields. They have set out with the bodies of the\nslain, and have come to their tents where there were many folk\nlamenting; but one and all of the others joined in the lament the\nGreeks were making. There was a great rally to their mourning.\nNow Soredamors, who hears the wailing and the lament for her\nfriend, thinks and believes that she was born in an evil hour.\nFor anguish and grief she loses memory and colour; and this it is\nthat grieves and wounds her much, but she dare not openly show\nher grief; she has hidden her mourning in her heart. And yet, if\nany one had marked it, he would have seen by her countenance and\nby her outer semblance, that she suffered great pain and sorrow\nof body; but each one had enough to do to utter his own grief and\nrecked nought of another's. Each was lamenting his own sorrow;\nfor they find their kinsmen and their friends in evil case; for\nthe river-bank was covered with them. Each lamented his own loss\nwhich is heavy and bitter. There the son weeps for the father,\nand here the father for the son; this man is swooning over his\ncousin, and this other, over his nephew; thus in each place they\nlament, fathers and brothers and kinsmen. But conspicuous above\nall is the lament that the Greeks were making although they\nmight, with justice, expect great joy; for the greatest mourning\nof all the host will soon turn to joy.\n\nThe Greeks are raising great lamentation without; and those who\nare within are at great pains how to let them hear that whereof\nthey will have much joy. They disarm and bind their prisoners who\nbeg and pray them to take now their heads; but the king's men do\nnot will or deign to do this. Rather, they say that they will\nkeep them until they deliver them to the king, who then will give\nthem their due, so that their merits will be requited. When they\nhad disarmed them all they have made them mount the battlements\nin order to show them to their folk below. Much does this\nkindness displease them; since they saw their lord taken and\nbound they were not a whit glad. Alexander, from the wall above,\nswears by God and the saints of the world that never will he let\na single one of them live, but will kill them all; and none shall\nstay his hand if they do not all go to yield themselves up to the\nking before he can take them. \"Go,\" quoth he, \"I bid you to my\nlord without fail, and place yourselves at his mercy. None of you\nsave the count here has deserved death. Never shall ye lose limb\nor life if ye place yourselves at his mercy. If ye do not redeem\nyourselves from death merely by crying 'Mercy', very little\nconfidence can ye have in your lives or in your bodies. Issue\nforth, all disarmed, to meet my lord, the king, and tell him from\nme, that Alexander sends you. Ye will not lose your pains; for\nthe king, my lord, will remit for you all his wrath and\nindignation, so gentle and debonair is he. And if ye will do\notherwise, ye will have to die; for never will pity for you seize\nhim.\" All of them together believe this counsel; they do not stop\ntill they reach the king's tent; and they have all fallen at his\nfeet. Now is it known throughout the host what they have told and\nrelated. The king mounts, and all have mounted with him; and they\ncome spurring to the castle, for no longer do they delay.\n\nAlexander issues forth from the castle towards the king to whom\nhis sight was well pleasing; and he has yielded up to him the\ncount. And the king has no longer delayed to do justice on him\nimmediately; but he greatly praises and extols Alexander; and all\nthe rest greet him with ceremony and praise and extol him loudly.\nThere is none who does not manifest joy. The mourning that they\nwere formerly making yields to joy; but no joy can be compared\nwith that of the Greeks. The king bids them give him the cup\nwhich was very magnificent and worth fifteen marks; and he tells\nand assures him that there is nought however dear, save the crown\nand the queen, that he will not yield to him if he will to ask\nit. Alexander dares not utter his desire in this matter, yet\nknows well that the king would not disappoint him if he asked for\nhis lady-love; but he greatly fears that he might displease her,\nwho would have had great joy thereat; for rather does he wish\ngrief for himself without her than to have her without her will.\nTherefore he begs and requests a respite; for he does not wish to\nmake his request till he know her pleasure in the matter; but he\nhas sought neither respite nor delay in possessing himself of the\ngolden cup. He takes the cup and generously entreats my Lord\nGawain until he accepts this cup from him; but with exceeding\ngreat reluctance has that knight accepted it. When Soredamors has\nheard the true news about Alexander much did it please and\ndelight her. When she knew that he is alive she has such joy\nthereof, that it seems to her never can she have  grief for an\nhour; but too long it seems to her does he tarry to come as he is\nwont. Soon she will have what she desires;  for the two vie with\neach other in their yearning for the same thing.\n\nAlexander greatly longed to be able to feast his eyes on her if\nonly with one sweet look. Already for a long time would he fain\nhave come to the queen's tent if he had not been kept elsewhere.\nDelay displeased him much, so soon as ever he could he came to\nthe queen in her tent. The queen has met him; for she knew much\nof his thought without his ever having spoken; but well had she\nperceived it. As he enters the tent she salutes him and takes\npains to greet him with due ceremony; well she knows what\noccasion brings him. Because she wishes to serve him to his\nliking she puts Soredamors by his side; and they three were alone\nconversing far from the others. The queen is the first to begin;\nfor she had no doubt at all that they loved each other, he her,\nand she him. Well she thinks to know it for a certainty and is\nconvinced that Soredamors could not have a better lover. She was\nseated between them and begins a discourse which came aptly and\nin season.\n\n\"Alexander,\" quoth the queen, \"Love is worse than hatred, for it\ngrieves and bewilders its devotee. Lovers know not what they do\nwhen the one hides his feelings from the other. In Love there is\nmuch grievous toil: he who does not make a bold beginning in the\nlaying of the foundation can scarce put on the coping-stone. The\nsaying goes that there is nothing so difficult to cross as the\nthreshold. I wish to instruct you about Love; for well I know\nthat Love is using you badly. For this reason have I taken you to\ntask; and take care that you conceal nought of it from me, for\nclearly have I seen from the countenances of each, that of two\nhearts you have made one. Never seek to hide it from me. You act\nvery foolishly in that the twain of you tell not your thoughts;\nfor you are killing each other by this concealment; you will be\nLove's murderers. Now, I counsel you that you seek not to satisfy\nyour love by rape or by lust. Unite yourselves in honourable\nmarriage. Thus as it seems to me your love will last long. I\nventure to assure you of this, that if you have a mind for it I\nwill bring about the marriage.\"\n\nWhen the queen had disburdened her heart Alexander on his side\ndisclosed his. \"Lady,\" quoth he, \"I deny nought whereof you\ncharge me; rather do I quite admit all that you say. Never do I\nseek to be free from Love, so as not always to devote myself to\nit. This that you of your pity have told me greatly pleases and\ndelights me. Since you know my will, I know not why I should any\nlonger conceal it from you. Very long ago if I had dared I would\nhave confessed it; for the concealment has pained me much. But\nperhaps this maiden would in no wise will that I should be hers,\nand she mine. If she grants me nought of herself, yet still I\ngive myself to her.\" At these words she trembled; and she does\nnot refuse this gift. She betrays the wish of her heart both in\nwords and looks; for trembling she gives herself to him, and says\nthat never will she make any reservation of will or heart or\nperson; but will be wholly at the queen's command and will do all\nher pleasure. The queen embraces them both and gives the one to\nthe other. Laughing, she says: \"I yield to thee, Alexander, the\nbody of thy love. Well I know that thou art not alarmed thereat.\nLet who will look askance thereat; I give you the one to the\nother. Hold, thou, what is thine, and thou, Alexander, what is\nthine.\" She has what is hers, and he, what is his; he, all of\nher,  and she, all of him. The betrothal took place that very day\nat Windsor, without a doubt with the consent and permission of my\nLord Gawain and the king. None could tell, I ween, of the\nmagnificence and feasting, of the joy and pleasure so great that\nat the wedding there would not have been more. But inasmuch  as\nit would displease most people, I will not waste or spend one\nword thereon, for I wish to apply myself to the telling of\nsomething better.\n\nOn one day at Windsor had Alexander so much honour and joy as\npleased him. Three joys and three honours he had: One was for the\ncastle that he took; the second, for that which King Arthur\npromised that he would give him when the war was ended--the best\nrealm in Wales--that day Arthur made him king in his halls. The\ngreatest joy was the third because his lady-love was queen of the\nchessboard whereof he was king. Before five months were passed\nSoredamors was great with human seed and grain; and she bore it\ntill her time. Such was the seed in its germ that the fruit came\naccording to its kind. A fairer child there could not be, before\nor after. They called the child Cliges.\n\nBorn was Cliges, in memory of whom this story was put into\nFrench. Ye shall hear me tell fully and relate of him and of his\nknightly service, when he shall have come to such an age, that he\nwill be destined to grow in fame. But meanwhile it happened in\nGreece that the emperor who ruled Constantinople came to his end.\nHe was dead; he needs must die, for he could not pass the term\nappointed. But before his death he assembled all the high barons\nof his land in order to send and fetch Alexander, his son, who\nwas in Britain where right willingly he tarried. The messengers\ndepart from Greece; o'er the sea they take their voyage; and\nthere a tempest overtakes them which sorely distresses their ship\nand their folk. They were all drowned in the sea save one\ntreacherous fellow, a renegade, who loved Alis, the younger son,\nmore than Alexander, the elder. When he had escaped from the sea\nhe has returned to Greece; and related that they had all been\ndrowned in a storm on the sea when they were returning from\nBritain; and were bringing away their lord; not one of them had\nescaped save he, only, from the storm and the peril. His lying\ntale was believed. Unopposed and unchallenged they take Alis and\ncrown him: they give to him the empire of Greece. But it was not\nlong ere Alexander knew for a certainty that Alis was emperor.\nForthwith he has taken leave of King Arthur; for by no means will\nhe resign his land to his brother without a fight. The king in no\nwise deters him from the plan; rather he bids him lead away with\nhim so great a multitude of Welsh Scots and Cornishmen, that his\nbrother will not dare to stand his ground when he shall see the\nhost assembled. Alexander might have led away a great force had\nhe willed. But he has no care to destroy his people if his\nbrother will answer him in such wise as to perform his promise.\nHe led away forty knights and Soredamors and his son. These two\nwould he not leave behind; for they were meet to be greatly\nloved. They sailed from Shoreham where they took leave of the\nwhole court; they had fair winds; the ship ran much more swiftly\nthan a fleeing stag. Before the month had passed, I ween, they\ncame to anchor before Athens, a city very magnificent and strong.\nThe emperor, in sooth, was staying in the city; and there was a\ngreat gathering there of the high barons of the land. As soon as\nthey were arrived Alexander sends a trusted servant into the city\nto know if he could have a fitting welcome there or if they will\ndeny that he is their rightful lord.\n\nThe bearer of this message was a courteous and prudent knight\nwhom men called Acorionde, a man of wealth and eloquence; and he\nwas much esteemed in the land, for he was a native of Athens.\n\nFrom of old his forbears had always had very high lordship in\nthe city. When he had heard told that the emperor was in the city\nhe goes to contend with him for the crown on behalf of Alexander,\nhis brother; and he cannot pardon him for that he has kept it\nunjustly. Straight into the palace has he come; and finds many a\none who greets him fair; but he gives no answer nor does he say a\nword to any man who greets him; rather he waits until he may hear\nwhat will and what mind they have toward their true lord. He does\nnot stop till he reaches the emperor; he greets him not, nor bows\nto him, nor calls him emperor. \"Alis,\" quoth he, \"I bear thee a\nmessage from Alexander who is out yonder in this harbour. Hear\nwhat word thy brother sends to thee: He asks of thee what is his\nand seeks nought that is contrary to justice. Constantinople\nwhich thou holdest ought to be his; and will be his. Neither\nreasonable nor right would it be that there should be discord\n'twixt you twain. Take my counsel, and come to terms with him,\nand give him the Crown in peace; for it is right meet that thou\nyield it to him.\"\n\nAlis replies: \"Fair sweet friend, thou hast taken on thyself a\nfoolish errand in that thou hast brought this message. No comfort\nhast thou brought to me, for I know well that my brother is dead.\nIt would be a great consolation to me if he were alive and I knew\nit. Never will I believe it till I see him. He is dead a while\nago; and that is a grief to me. Not a word that thou sayest do I\nbelieve. And if he is alive wherefore comes he not? Never need he\nfear that I will not give him land in plenty. He is mad if he\nkeeps aloof from me; and if he serve me he will never be the\nworse for it. Never will there be any man that will hold the\ncrown and the empire against me.\" Acorionde hears that the\nemperor's reply is not favourable; but by no fear is he withheld\nfrom speaking his mind. \"Alis,\" quoth he, \"may God confound me if\nthe matter is left thus. On thy brother's behalf I defy thee, and\non his behalf, as is meet, I exhort all those that I see here to\nleave thee and come over to his side. It is meet that they cleave\nto him; him ought they to make their lord. He who is loyal, let\nnow his loyalty appear.\"\n\nWith this word he leaves the court; and the emperor, on his side,\nsummons those in whom he most trusts. From them he seeks\ncounsel as to his brother who thus challenges him, and seeks to\nknow if he can fully trust them not to give support or aid to him\nin this attack. Thus he hopes to prove each one; but he finds not\neven one to cleave to him with regard to the war; rather do they\nbid him remember the war that Eteocles waged against Polynices,\nwho was his own brother, in which the one killed the other with\nhis own hands. \"A like thing may chance with regard to you if you\nare bent on pursuing war; and the land will be ruined by reason\nthereof.\" Therefore they counsel him to seek such a peace as may\nbe reasonable and honourable; and that the one make no\nunreasonable demands on the other. Now Alis hears that if he does\nnot make a fair covenant with his brother, all the barons will\ndesert him; and he said they will never desire an arrangement\nwhich he cannot equitably make; but he establishes in the\ncovenant that whate'er the outcome of the matter the crown remain\nto him.\n\nIn order to make firm and lasting peace Alis sends one of his\nmasters-at-arms and bids Alexander come to him and rule all the\nland; but that he do Alis so much honour as to allow him to keep\nthe name of emperor and let him have the crown; thus, if he will,\ncan this covenant be made 'twixt the twain of them. When this\nthing was related and told to Alexander, his folk have mounted\nwith him and have come to Athens. With joy were they received;\nbut it does not please Alexander that his brother should have the\nlordship of the empire and of the crown if he give him not his\npromise that never will he wed woman; but that after him, Cliges\nshall be emperor of Constantinople. Thus are the brothers\nreconciled. Alexander makes him swear; and Alis grants and\nwarrants him that never as long as he shall live will he take\nwife. They are reconciled and remain friends. The barons manifest\ngreat joy; they take Alis for emperor; but before Alexander come\naffairs great and small. Whatever he commands and says is done;\nand little is done except through him. Alis has no longer\nanything but the name--for he is called emperor--but Alexander is\nserved and loved; and he who does not serve him through love,\nmust needs do so through fear. By means of love and fear he rules\nall the land according to his will. But he whose name is Death\nspares no man, weak or strong, but slays and kills them all.\nAlexander was destined to die; for a sickness for which there was\nno remedy took him in its grip; but before death came upon him he\nsent for his son and said: \"Fair son, Cliges, never canst thou\nknow how much prowess and valour thou shalt have if thou go not\nfirst to prove thyself at King Arthur's court on both the Britons\nand the French. If fate lead thee thither, so bear and demean\nthyself that thou remain unknown till thou hast proved thyself on\nthe flower of the knighthood at the court. I counsel thee that\nthou believe me in this matter; and that if opportunity comes\nthou fear not to put thy fortune to the test with thy uncle, my\nLord Gawain. Prithee forget not this.\"\n\nAfter this exhortation he lived not long. Soredamors had such\ngrief thereat that she could not live after him. For sheer grief\nshe died when he died. Alis and Cliges both mourned for them as\nthey were bound; but in time they ceased to mourn. For all\nmourning must come to an end; all things needs must cease. Ill is\nit to prolong mourning, for no good can come of it. The mourning\nhas ceased; and for a long time after the emperor has refrained\nfrom taking wife, for he would fain strive after loyalty. But\nthere is no court in all the world that is pure from evil\ncounsel. Nobles often leave the right way through the evil\ncounsels to which they give credence, so that they do not keep\nloyalty. Often do his men come to the emperor, and they give him\ncounsel, and exhort him to take a wife. So much do they exhort\nand urge him, and each day do they so much beset him, that\nthrough their great importunity, they have turned him from his\nloyalty, and he promises to do their will. But he says that she\nwho is to be lady of Constantinople must needs be very graceful\nand fair and wise, rich and of high degree. Then his counsellors\nsay to him that they will make ready and will hie them into the\nGerman land to sue for the daughter of the emperor. They counsel\nhim to take her; for the emperor of Germany is very mighty and\nvery powerful and his daughter is so fair that never in\nChristendom was there a damsel of such beauty. The emperor grants\nthem all their suit; and they set out on the way like folk well\nequipped. They have ridden in their days' journeys until they\nfound the emperor at Ratisbon, and asked him to give his elder\ndaughter for their lord's behalf.\n\nThe emperor was full blithe at this embassy and gladly has he\npromised them his daughter; for he in no wise abases himself by\nso doing and abates not one jot of his dignity. But he says that\nhe had promised to give her to the Duke of Saxony; and that the\nGreeks could not take her away unless the emperor came and\nbrought a mighty force, so that the duke could not do him hurt or\ninjury on the way back to Greece.\n\nWhen the messengers had heard the emperor's reply they take their\nleave and set out once more for home. They have returned to their\nlord and have told him the reply. And the emperor has taken\nchosen men, knights proven in arms, the best that he has found,\nand he takes with him his nephew, for whose sake he had vowed\nthat he would never take wife as long as he lived. But in no wise\nwill he keep this vow if he can win to reach Cologne. On a day\nappointed he departs from Greece and shapes his course towards\nGermany; for he will not fail for blame nor for reproach to take\na wife. But his honour will wane thereby. He does not stop till\nhe reaches Cologne where the emperor had established his court\nfor a festival held for all Germany. When the company of the\nGreeks had come to Cologne there were so many Greeks and so many\nGermans from the north, that more than sixty thousand had to find\nquarters outside the town.\n\nGreat was the gathering of folk, and very great was the joy that\nthe two emperors showed, for they were right glad to meet face to\nface. In the palace which was very long was the assembly of the\nbarons; and now the emperor sent for his beautiful daughter. The\nmaiden did not tarry. Straightway she came into the palace; and\nshe was fair, and so well shaped, just as God Himself had made\nher; for it pleased Him greatly to show such workmanship as to\nmake people marvel. Never did God who fashioned her give to man a\nword that could express so much beauty, that there was not in her\nstill more beauty.\n\nFenice was the maiden named, and not without reason; for just as\nthe bird Phoenix is fairest above all others and there cannot be\nmore than one phoenix at a time, so Fenice, I deem, had no peer\nfor beauty. It was a wonder and a marvel, for never again could\nNature attain to framing her like. Inasmuch as I should say less\nthan the truth, I will not in words describe arms nor body nor\nhead nor hands; for if I had a thousand years to live and each\nday had doubled my wisdom I should still waste all my time, and\nyet never express the truth of it. I know well that if I meddled\nwith it I should exhaust all my wisdom upon it and should\nsquander all my pains; for it would be wasted pains. The maiden\nhas hastened and has come into the palace with head uncovered and\nface bare; and the sheen of her beauty sheds greater light in the\npalace than four carbuncles would have done. Now Cliges had\ndoffed his cloak in presence of his uncle, the emperor. The day\nwas somewhat cloudy but so beauteous were the twain, both the\nmaid and he, that there shot forth from their beauty a ray with\nwhich the palace glowed again, just as the sun shines bright and\nruddy in the morning.\n\nTo describe the beauty of Cliges I will limn you a portrait, the\ntraits of which shall be very briefly told. He was in the flower\nof his youth, for he was about fifteen years old. He was fairer\nand more comely than Narcissus' who saw his own reflection in the\nfountain beneath the elm, and loved it so much when he saw it\nthat he died--so folk say--because he could not have it. Much\nbeauty had he, and little wit, but Cliges had greater store of\nboth, just as fine gold surpasses copper, and yet more than I can\nsay. His hair seemed like fine gold and his face a fresh-blown\nrose. His nose was well shaped, and his mouth beautiful, and he\nwas of great stature as Nature best knew how to frame him; for in\nhim alone she put all at once what she is wont to dole out to\neach in portions. In framing him Nature was so lavish that she\nput everything into him all at once and gave him whatsoever she\ncould. Such was Cliges who had in him wisdom and beauty,\ngenerosity and strength. He had the timber together with the\nbark, and knew more of fencing and of archery, of birds and of\nhounds, than Tristram, King Mark's nephew; not one grace was\nlacking to Cliges.\n\nCliges in all his beauty was standing before his uncle; and those\nwho did not know him were in a fever to see him; and also those\nwho do not know the maiden are eagerly straining to see her; all\nlook at her with wonder; but Cliges, in love, directs his eyes to\nher secretly, and withdraws them so prudently that neither in the\ngoing or the coming of the gaze can one consider him a fool for\nhis action. Right lovingly he regards her; but he does not pay\nheed to the fact that the maiden pays him back in kind. In true\nlove not in flattery he gives his eyes into her keeping, and\nreceives hers. Right good seems this exchange to her; and it\nwould have seemed to her far better if she had known somewhat of\nhis worth. But she knows no more than that she sees him fair; and\nif she were ever destined to love aught because of the beauty\nthat she might see in it, it is not meet that she should set her\nheart elsewhere. She has set her eyes and her heart there; and he\nin his turn has promised her his. Promised? Nay, but given for\ngood and all. Given? Nay, in faith, I lie; he has not, for no\none can give his heart. Needs must I say it in a different\nfashion. I will not speak as they speak who join two hearts in\none body; for it is not true, and has not even the semblance of\ntruth to say that one body can have two hearts at once. And even\nif they could come together such a thing could not be believed.\nBut, and it please you to hearken to me, I shall be able well to\nrender you the reason why two hearts blend in one without coming\ntogether. In so far as only they blend in one, the will of each\npasses from one to the other, and the twain have the same desire,\nand because they have the same desire, there are folk who are\nwont to say that each of them possesses both the hearts. But one\nheart is not in two places. Well may their desire be the same,\nand yet each, always, his own heart, just as many different men\ncan sing in harmony one song or verse; and I prove to you by this\nparable that one body cannot have two hearts because one knows\nthe other's will, or because the second knows what the first\nloves and what he hates. A body cannot have more than one heart\nany more than the voices which sing in harmony, so that they seem\nto be but a single voice, can be the voice of one person alone.\nBut it profits me not to dwell on this; for another task demands\nmy care. Henceforth I must speak of the maiden and of Cliges; and\nye shall hear of the Duke of Saxony who has sent to Cologne a\nnephew of his, a mere stripling, who discloses to the emperor\nwhat his uncle, the duke, bids him deliver--that the emperor\nexpect not from him truce or peace if he send not to him his\ndaughter; and let not that man feel confident on the way who\nthinks to take her thence with him; for he will not find the way\nvoid of foes; rather will it be right well defended against him\nif she is not given up to the duke.\n\nWell did the stripling deliver his message, all without pride and\nwithout presumption; but he finds none, nor knight nor emperor,\nto reply to him. When he saw that they were all silent and that\nthey did it from contempt, he is for quitting the court\ndefiantly. But youth and audacity made him challenge Cliges to\njoust against him ere he departed. They mount to horse in order\nto tilt; on both sides they count three hundred so were equal in\nnumber. The whole palace is empty and deserted; for there remains\nthere neither man nor woman, nor knight nor damsel, who does not\ngo and mount on the palace roof, on to the battlements, and to\nthe windows, to see and behold those who were to tilt. Even the\nprincess has mounted thither, she whom Love had conquered and won\nto his will. She is seated at a window where she greatly delights\nto sit because from thence she can see him whom she has hidden in\nher heart, nor hath she desire to take him away from that\nhiding-place; for never will she love any save him. But she knows\nnot what is his name nor who he is or of what race nor does it\nbecome her to ask; and yet she longs to hear aught whereat her\nheart may rejoice. Through the window she looks out on the\nshields where the gold shines, and on those who carry them slung\nround their necks, and who take delight in the jousting; but her\nthought and her glance she has wholly set in one direction, for\nshe gives no thought to aught else. She is eager to gaze on\nCliges and follows him with her eyes wherever he goes. And he, on\nhis part, tilts strenuously for her before the eyes of all, only\nthat she may hear that he is valiant and very skilful; for in any\ncase it would be meet that she should esteem him for his prowess.\nHe turns himself toward the nephew of the duke who rode apace,\nbreaking many lances and discomfiting the Greeks; but Cliges, who\nis mightily vexed thereat, presses with all his weight on his\nstirrups, and rides to strike him so rapidly that the Saxon, in\nspite of himself, has voided his saddle-bows. There was a great\nstir as he rose again. The stripling rises and mounts, and thinks\nto avenge thoroughly his shame; but many a man thinks to avenge\nhis shame if he is permitted, who increases it. The youth rushes\ntowards Cliges; and Cliges lowers his lance to meet him; and\nattacks him with such violence that he bears him once more to the\nground. Now has the youth redoubled his shame, and all his folk\nare dismayed thereat; for well they see that never will they\nleave the fray with honour; for none of them is there so valiant,\nthat if Cliges comes attacking him he can remain in his\nsaddle-bow to meet him. Right glad thereof are they of Germany\nand they of Greece when they see that their side are sending the\nSaxons about their business; for the Saxons depart as though\ndiscomfited, while the others pursue them with contumely until\nthey catch them up at a stream. Many of the foe do they plunge\nand immerse therein. Cliges, in the deepest part of the ford, has\nthrown the duke's nephew, and so many others with him, that to\ntheir shame and their vexation, they flee, mournful and sad. But\nCliges returns with joy, bearing off the prize for valour on both\nsides; and he came straight to a door which was close to the\nplace where Fenice was standing who exacts the toll of a sweet\nlook as he enters the door, a toll which he pays her, for their\neyes have met. Thus has one conquered the other.\n\nBut there is no German whether of the north or of the south so\nmuch as able to speak who does not say: \"God! who is this in whom\nso great beauty blooms? God! whence has the power come to him so\nearly that he has won so great distinction?\" Thus asks this man\nand that, \"Who is this youth, who is he?\" till throughout the\ncity they soon know the truth of it, both his name and his\nfather's, and the promise which the emperor had made and granted\nto him. It is already so much told and noised abroad that even\nthe maiden hears tell of it, who had great joy in her heart\nthereat because now she can never say that Love has scorned her,\nnor can she complain of aught; for he makes her love the fairest,\nthe most courteous, and the most valiant man that one could ever\nfind anywhere; but she must needs have as her husband one who\ncannot please her; and she is full of anguish and distress\nthereat; for she does not know with whom to take counsel\nconcerning him whom she desires save only with her own thoughts\nas she lies awake. And thought and wakefulness so deal with her\nthat they blanch her and altogether change her complexion, so\nthat one can see quite clearly by her loss of colour that she has\nnot what she desires; for she plays less than her wont, and\nlaughs less, and disports herself less; but she hides it well and\ndenies it stoutly if any ask what ails her. Her nurse, who had\nbrought her up from infancy, was named Thessala, and was versed\nin the black art. She was called Thessala because she was born in\nThessaly where sorceries are made, taught, and practised; for the\nwomen who are of that country make charms and enchantments.\n\nThessala sees that she whom Love has in his power is wan and\npale, and she has addressed her secretly. \"God!\" quoth she, \"are\nyou enchanted, my sweet lady dear, that you have so wan a\ncountenance? Much do I wonder what ails you. Tell me, if you\nknow, in what part this sickness possesses you most; for if any\none can cure you of it you can rely on me, for well can I give\nyou back your health. Well know I how to cure a man of dropsy,\nand I know how to cure of gout, of quinsy, and of asthma; I know\nso much about the water and so much about the pulse that evil\nwould be the hour in which you would take another leech. And I\nknow, if I dared say it, of enchantments and of charms, well\nproven and true, more than ever Medea knew. Never spake I a word\nof it to you; and yet I have brought you up till now; but never\nreproach yourself at all for it, for never would I have said\naught to you if I had not seen for a surety that such a malady\nhas attacked you, that you have need of my aid. Lady, tell me\nyour malady, and you will act wisely in doing so before it gets\nfurther hold of you. The emperor has set me in charge of you that\nI may take care of you; and I have given such diligence that I\nhave kept you in sound health. Now shall I have lost my pains if\nI heal you not of this ill. Beware that you hide it not from me,\nbe it illness or aught else.\" The maiden dares not openly\ndisclose her whole desire because she is greatly afeard that\nThessala may blame and dissuade her. And yet because she hears\nher greatly vaunt and extol herself, and say that she is learned\nin enchantment, in charms and potions, she will tell her what is\nher case, why her face is pale and wan; but beforehand she will\nmake her promise that she will hide it for ever and will never\ndissuade her.\n\n\"Nurse,\" quoth she, \"of a truth I thought that I felt no ill; but\nI shall speedily think that I am sick. The mere fact of my\nthinking of it causes me much ill and eke alarms me. But how does\none know unless he put it to the test what may be good and what\nill? My ill differs from all other ills; for--and I be willing to\ntell you the truth of it--much it joys me, and much it grieves\nme, and I delight in my discomfort; and if there can be a disease\nwhich gives pleasure, my sorrow is my desire, and my grief is my\nhealth. I know not then whereof I should complain; for I know\nnought whence evil may come to me if it come not from my desire.\nPossibly my desire is a malady; but I take so much pleasure in\nthat desire that it causes me a pleasant grief; and I have so\nmuch joy in my sorrow that my malady is a pleasant one. Thessala,\nnurse! tell me now, is not this sorrow which seems sweet to me,\nand yet which tortures me, a deceitful one? I know not how I may\nrecognise whether it be an infirmity or no. Nurse! tell me now\nthe name, and the manner, and the nature, of it. But be well\nassured that I have no care to recover in any wise, for I cherish\nthe anguish of it exceedingly.\" Thessala, who was right wise as\nregards Love and all his ways, knows and understands by her\nspeech that that which distracts her proceeds from Love--because\nshe calls and names it sweet--it is certain that she loves; for\nall other ills are bitter save that alone which comes from\nloving; but Love transmutes its own bitterness into pleasure, and\nsweetness often turns to its opposite. But Thessala, who well\nknew the matter, replies to her: \"Fear nought, I will tell you\nwell both the nature and the name of your disease. You have told\nme, methinks, that the pain which you feel seems to you to be joy\nand health: of such a nature is love-sickness; for there is in it\njoy and sweetness. Therefore I prove to you that you love; for I\nfind pleasure in no sickness save only in love-sickness. All\nother ills as a rule are always grievous and horrible; but Love\nis pleasant and tranquil. You love; I am fully certain of it. I\nregard it not as base in you; but I will hold it baseness if\nthrough childishness or folly you conceal your heart from me.\"\n\"Nurse, truly you are talking to no purpose; for first I mean to\nbe certain and sure that never by any chance will you speak\nthereof to any living creature.\" \"Lady, certainly the winds will\nspeak of it sooner than I unless you give me permission; and of\nthis I will make you sure--that I will help you with regard to\nthis matter, so that you may know of a surety, that by me you\nwill have your joy.\" \"Nurse, in that case you would have cured\nme; but the emperor is giving me in marriage whereat I am\ngrievously afflicted and sad because he who pleases me is nephew\nof him whom I am to wed. And if this man have his joy of me, then\nhave I lost mine; and there is no more joy to be looked for.\nRather would I be torn limb from limb than that the love of\nIseult and of Tristram should be renewed in the case of us twain;\nfor of them are such mad actions told that I am ashamed to\nrecount them. I could not reconcile myself to the life that\nIseult led. Love in her became exceeding base; for her body\nbelonged to two masters and her heart entirely to one. Thus she\nspent her whole life; for she never refused the two. Reason was\nthere none in this love; but mine is ever constant; and at no\ncost will a partition ever be made of my body or of my heart.\nNever of a truth shall my body be debased; never shall there be\ntwo partners of it. Let him who owns the heart have the body\nalso; he excludes all others from it. But this I cannot know--how\nhe to whom my heart yields itself can have my body since my\nfather is giving me to another; and I dare not gainsay him. And\nwhen he shall be lord of my body if he do aught with it that I do\nnot wish, it is not meet that it welcome another. Moreover, this\nman cannot wed wife without breaking faith; but if he wrong not\nhis nephew, Cliges will have the empire after his death. But if\nyou can contrive by your arts, that this man to whom I am given\nand pledged might never have part or lot in me, you would have\ndone me good service according to my will. Nurse, prithee strive\nthat this man break not his faith; for he gave his pledge to the\nfather of Cliges, promising just as Alexander had made him swear,\nthat never would he take wedded wife. His pledge is about to be\nbroken, for straightway he intends to wed me. But I cherish\nCliges so dearly that I would rather be buried than that he\nshould lose through me a farthing of the inheritance which ought\nto be his. May never child be born of me by whom he may be\ndisinherited! Nurse, now bestir yourself in the matter that I may\nbe yours for ever.\" Then her nurse tells her and assures her that\nshe will weave such spells and potions and enchantments that she\nwould be ill-advised to have concern or fear for this emperor; so\nsoon as he shall have drunk of the potion that she will give him\nto drink, and they will both lie together; but however close she\nwill be to him, she can be as secure as if there were a wall\nbetween the two of them. \"But let not this and this only vex you\nif he has his pleasure of you in dreams; for, when he shall be\nsound asleep, he will have joy of you in dreaming; and will quite\nsurely think that he has his joy of you waking, nor will he\nimagine that it is a dream, or vision, or falsehood. He will\ndelight in you so that he will think he is awake while he is\nsleeping.\"\n\nThe maiden loves and approves and esteems this boon and this\nservice. Her nurse, who promises her this, and vows to keep faith\nwith her, puts her in good hope; for by this means she will think\nto come to her joy however long she have to wait. For never will\nCliges be so ill-disposed to her--if he knows that she loves him;\nand for his sake lives so as to guard her maidenhead in order to\nshield for him his inheritance--as not to have some pity on her\nif he prove himself of a noble stock, and if he is such as he\nought to be. The maiden believes her nurse, and trusts and\nconfides in her greatly. The one vows and swears to the other\nthat this plan will be kept so secret that never will it be known\nin the future. Thus the parley is ended; and when it came to the\nmorning the emperor of Germany sends for his daughter. She comes\nat his command--but why should I spin out my story? The two\nemperors together have so arranged matters that the marriage\ntakes place and joy begins in the palace. But I will not delay to\nspeak of each thing severally. I will turn my tale of Thessala,\nwho does not cease to make and mix potions.\n\nThessala crushes her potion; she puts therein spices in plenty\nfor sweetening and blending. Well does she pound and mix it, and\nstrains it till the whole is clear, and there is nought acid nor\nbitter there; for the spices which are in it make it sweet and of\npleasant odour. When the potion was prepared, then had the day\nrun its course, and the tables were placed for supper, and the\ntablecloths laid; but she delays the supper. It is Thessala's\ntask to spy out by what device, by what messenger, she will send\nher potion. They were all seated at the banquet; they had had\nmore than six courses and Cliges was serving his uncle. Thessala,\nwho sees him serve, reflects that he is wasting his Service; for\nhe is serving to his own disinheritance, and this is a great\nsorrow and anxiety to her. Then like the courteous dame that she\nis, she bethinks herself that she will make him to whom it will\nbe joy and profit serve the potion. Thessala sends for Cliges,\nand he went straightway to her, and has inquired, and asked of\nher why she had sent for him. \"Friend,\" quoth she, \"at this\nbanquet I wish to pay the emperor the flattering meed of a potion\nthat he will greatly esteem. I will not that he drink to-night,\neither at supper or at bedtime, of any other drink. I think that\nit will give him much pleasure; for never did he taste of aught\nso good nor did any beverage ever cost so much; and take good\ncare--I warn you of this--that no other drink of it because there\nis too little of it for that. And, moreover, I give you this\nadvice, that he never know whence it came; but let him think it\ncame by accident, that you found it among the presents, and that\nbecause you tested it, and perceived by the scent of its bouquet\nthe fragrance of good spices, and because you saw that it\nsparkled, you poured the wine into his cup. If by chance he\ninquire of it, that will doubtless be the end of the matter. But\nhave no evil suspicion anent aught that I have said; for the\nbeverage is pure and wholesome, and full of good spices, and it\nmay be, as I think, that at some future time it will make you\nblithe.\" When he hears that good will come of it he takes the\npotion and goes away; for he knows not that there is aught wrong.\nIn a cup of crystal he has set it before the emperor. The emperor\nhas taken the cup, for he has great trust in his nephew. He\ndrinks a mighty draught of the potion; and now he feels the\nvirtue of it; for it penetrates from the head to the heart, and\nfrom the heart it returns to his head, and it permeates him again\nand again. It saturates his whole body without hurting him. And\nby the time the tables were removed, the emperor had drunk so\nmuch of the beverage which had pleased him, that never will he\nget free of it. Each night while asleep he will be intoxicated;\nand yet it will excite him so much that though asleep, he will\ndream that he is awake.\n\nNow is the emperor mocked. Many bishops and abbots there were at\nthe benediction and consecration of the bed. When it was bedtime\nthe emperor, as it behoved him, lay with his wife that night. \"As\nit behoved him\"--therein have I lied, for he never embraced or\ntouched her though they lay together in one bed. At first the\nmaiden trembles; for greatly does she fear and feel alarm lest\nthe potion take no effect. But it has so bewitched him that never\nwill he have his will of her or of another save when asleep. But\nthen he will have such ecstasy as one can have in dreaming; and\nyet he will hold the dream for true. In one word I have told you\nall: never had he other delight of her than in dreams. Thus must\nhe needs fare evermore if he can lead his bride away; but before\nhe can hold her in safety a great disaster, I ween, may befall\nhim. For when he will return home, the duke, to whom she was\nfirst given, will be no laggard. The duke has gathered a great\nforce, and has occupied all the marches, and his spies are at the\ncourt, and inform him each day of all he wants to know, and tell\nhim all the measures he must take, and how long they will tarry,\nand when they will return, through what places, and by what\npasses. The emperor did not long tarry after the wedding.\nBlithely he departs from Cologne; and the emperor of Germany\nescorts him with a very great company because he greatly fears\nand dreads the might of the Duke of Saxony.\n\nThe two emperors proceed and stop not till they reach Ratisbon;\nand on one evening they were lodged by the Danube in the meadow.\nThe Greeks were in their tents in the meadows beside the Black\nForest. The Saxons who were observing them were encamped opposite\nthem. The duke's nephew was left all alone on a hill to keep a\nlook-out, and see whether, peradventure, he might gain any\nadvantage over those yonder or wreak any mischief upon them.\n\nFrom his post of vantage he saw Cliges riding with three other\nstriplings who were taking their pleasure, carrying lances and\nshields in order to tilt and to disport themselves. Now is the\nduke's nephew bent on attacking and injuring them if ever he can.\nWith five comrades he sets out; and the six have posted\nthemselves secretly beside the wood in a valley, so that the\nGreeks never saw them till they issued from the valley, and till\nthe duke's nephew rushes upon Cliges and strikes him, so that he\nwounds him a little in the region of the spine. Cliges stoops and\nbows his head, so that the lance glances off him; nevertheless,\nit wounds him a little.\n\nWhen Cliges perceives that he is wounded he has rushed upon the\nstripling, and strikes him straightway with such violence that he\nthrusts his lance right through his heart and fells him dead.\nThen the Saxons, who fear him mightily, all take to flight and\nscatter through the heart of the forest while Cliges, who knows\nnot of the ambush, commits a reckless and foolish act; for he\nseparates himself from his comrades, and pursues in that\ndirection in which the duke's force was. And now all the host\nwere preparing to make an attack on the Greeks. Cliges, all\nalone, without aid, pursues them; and the youths all dismayed\nbecause of their lord whom they have lost, come running into the\nduke's presence; and, weeping, recount to him the evil hap of his\nnephew. The duke thinks it no light matter; by God and all his\nsaints, he swears that never in all his life will he have joy or\ngood luck as long as he shall know that the slayer of his nephew\nis alive. He says that he who will bring him Cliges' head shall\nverily be deemed his friend, and will give him great comfort.\nThen a knight has boasted that the head of Cliges will be offered\nto the duke by him; let the duke but rely on him.\n\nCliges pursues the youths till he swooped down on the Saxons, and\nis seen by the knight who has engaged to carry off his head.\nStraightway, that knight departs and stays no longer. But Cliges\nhas retreated in order to elude his enemies; and he returned at\nfull gallop thither where he had left his comrades. But he has\nfound none of them there; for they had returned to the tents to\nrelate their adventure. And the emperor summoned Greeks and\nGermans alike to horse. Through all the host the barons speedily\narm themselves and mount. But the Saxon knight, all armed, his\nvisor laced, has continued to pursue Cliges at a gallop. Cliges,\nwho never wished to have aught in common with a recreant or\ncoward, sees him come alone. First of all the knight has assailed\nhim with words: he stoutly calls him baseborn fellow, for he\ncould not conceal the mind he had of him. \"Fellow,\" quoth he,\n\"here wilt thou leave the forfeit for my lord, whom thou hast\nslain. If I bear not off thy head with me, then esteem me not\nworth a bad Byzantine coin. I will to make the duke a present of\nit, for I will not accept any other forfeit in its stead. So much\nwill I render to him for his nephew; and he will have had a good\nexchange for him.\" Cliges hears that the Saxon is abusing him as\na madman and low-bred fellow. \"Man,\" quoth he, \"now defend\nyourself; for I defy you to take my head, and you shall not have\nit without my leave.\" Forthwith the one seeks the other. The\nSaxon has missed his stroke; and Cliges thrusts so hard that he\nmade man and steed fall all in a heap. The steed falls backwards\non his rider with such violence that it completely breaks one of\nhis legs. Cliges dismounts on the green grass and disarms him.\nWhen he had disarmed him, then he dons the arms himself, and has\ncut off his head with the victim's own sword. When he had cut off\nhis head, he has fixed it on to the point of his lance; and says\nthat he will present it to the duke to whom his enemy had vowed\nto present Cliges' own head if he could meet him in the fight. No\nsooner had Cliges placed the helmet on his head, taken the shield,\n(not his own, but the shield of him who had fought with him),\nand no sooner had he mounted on the foeman's horse, leaving his\nown rider-less in order to dismay the Greeks, than he saw more\nthan a hundred banners and battalions, great and fully equipped,\nof Greeks and Germans mingled. Now will begin a very fierce and\ncruel melee between the Saxons and the Greeks. As soon as Cliges\nsees them come, he goes straight towards the Saxons; and the\nGreeks exert themselves to pursue him; for on account of his arms\nthey do not know him; and his uncle, who sees the head that he is\nbringing, is marvellously discomforted thereat. No wonder is it\nif he fears for his nephew. The whole host musters in his wake;\nand Cliges lets them pursue him in order to begin the melee till\nthe Saxons perceive him coming; but the arms with which he is\nclad and furnished mislead them all. He has mocked at them and\nscorned them; for the duke and all the others as he advanced with\nhoisted lance, say: \"Our knight is coming! On the point of the\nlance that he holds he is bringing the head of Cliges; and the\nGreeks follow after him. Now to horse to succour him!\" Then they\nall give the rein to their horses; and Cliges spurs towards the\nSaxons, covering himself behind his shield and doubling himself\nup, his lance upright, the head on its point. Not one whit less\ncourage than a lion had he, though he was no stronger than\nanother. On both sides they believe that he is dead--Saxons, and\nGreeks and Germans--and the one side are blithe thereat; and the\nother side, grieved; but soon will the truth be known. For now\nhas Cliges no longer held his peace: shouting, he gallops towards\na Saxon, and strikes him with his ashen lance with the head on\nit, full in the breast, so that he has lost his stirrups; and he\ncalls out, \"Barons, strike! I am Cliges whom you seek. On now,\nbold freeborn knights! Let there be no coward, for ours is the\nfirst shock. Let no craven taste of such a dainty dish.\"\n\nThe emperor greatly rejoiced when he heard his nephew, Cliges,\nwho thus addresses and exhorts them; right glad and comforted is\nhe thereof. And the duke is utterly dumfounded, for now he knows\nwell that he is betrayed unless his force is the greater; he bids\nhis men close their ranks and keep together. And the Greeks, in\nclose array, have not gone far from them, for now they are\nspurring and pricking. On both sides they couch their lances and\nmeet and receive each other as it behoved them to do in such a\nfight. At the first encounter, they pierce shields and shatter\nlances, cut girths, break stirrups; the steeds stand bereft of\nthose who fall upon the field. But no matter what the others do,\nCliges and the duke meet; they hold their lances couched; and\neach strikes the other on his shield with so great valour that\nthe lances, which were strong and well wrought, break into\nsplinters. Cliges was a skilful horseman: he remained upright in\nhis saddle, never stumbling nor wavering. The duke has lost his\nsaddle, and in spite of himself has voided the saddle-bows.\nCliges thinks to take him and lead him away captive, and mightily\ntoils and strains; but the strength he needed was not his. For\nthe Saxons were all around, and they rescue their duke by force.\nNevertheless, Cliges leaves the field without injury; with a\nprize; for he leads away the duke's steed which was whiter than\nwool and which, for the use of a man of valour, was worth all the\npossessions of Octavian of Rome: the steed was an Arab one. Great\njoy manifest Greeks and Germans when they see Cliges mounted on\nit; for they had seen the worth and the perfection of the Arab;\nbut they did not suspect an ambush nor will they ever perceive it\ntill they receive great loss therefrom.\n\nA spy has come to the duke with news at which he has waxed full\njoyous. \"Duke,\" quoth the spy, \"no man has been left in all the\ntents of the Greeks who can defend himself. Now can thy men take\nthe daughter of the emperor, if thou wilt trust my words, while\nthou seest the Greeks desperately bent on the fight and on the\nbattle. Give me a hundred of thy knights and I will give them thy\nlady-love. By an old and lonely path, I will lead them so\nprudently that they shall not be seen or met by Saxon or German\ntill they will be able to take the maiden in her tent, and lead\nher away so unhindered that never will she be denied them.\" The\nduke is blithe at this thing. He has sent a hundred and more wise\nknights with the spy; and the spy has led them in such wise that\nthey take the maiden as a prize, nor have they spent great force\nthereon, for easily were they able to lead her away. When they\nhad taken her some distance from the tents, they sent her away\nattended by twelve of them, nor did the rest accompany the twelve\nfar. Twelve of them lead away the maiden; the others have told\nthe duke the news of their success. Nought else was there that\nthe duke had desired, and straightway he makes a truce with the\nGreeks till the morrow. They have given and accepted a truce. The\nduke's men have returned; and the Greeks without any delay return,\neach one to his tent. But Cliges remained alone on a hill so\nthat no one noticed him till he saw the twelve coming, and the\ndamsel whom they were taking away at full speed and at a gallop.\nCliges, who longs to gain renown, forthwith dashes in their\ndirection, for he thinks to himself, and his heart tells him that\nit is not for nothing they are fleeing. The very moment that he\nsaw them, he dashes after them; and they see him; but they think\nand believe a foolish thing. \"The duke is following us,\" each one\nsays, \"let us wait for him a little; for he has left the host\nunattended and is coming after us very swiftly.\" There is not a\nsingle one who does not believe this. They all desire to go to\nmeet him; but each desires to go alone. Cliges must needs descend\ninto a great valley between two mountains. Never would he have\nrecognised their insignia if they had not come to meet him, or if\nthey had not awaited him. Six of them advanced to meet him; but\nsoon will they have had an ill meeting with him. The others stay\nwith the maiden and lead her on, gently, at a walking pace. And\nthe six go at full speed, spurring incessantly through the\nvalley. He who had the swiftest horse outstripped all the rest,\ncrying aloud: \"Duke of Saxony! God preserve thee! Duke! We have\nregained thy lady. Now shall the Greeks never carry her off; for\nshe will now be given and handed over to thee.\" When Cliges has\nheard these words that the other cries out, no smile had he in\nhis heart; rather is it a marvel that frenzy does not seize him.\nNever was any wild beast: leopardess, or tigress, or lioness, who\nsees her young taken, so embittered, and furious, and lusting,\nfor the fight as was Cliges who cares not to live if he fail his\nlady. Rather would he die than not have her. Very great wrath has\nhe for this calamity and exceeding great courage does it give\nhim. He spurs and pricks the Arab; and goes to deal the blazoned\nshield of the Saxon such a blow that--I lie not--he made him feel\nthe lance at his heart. This has given Cliges confidence. More\nthan a full acre's measure has he spurred and pricked the Arab\nbefore the second has drawn near, for they came, one by one. The\none has no fear for the other; for he fights with each singly and\nmeets them one by one, nor has the one aid of the other. He makes\nan attack on the second, who thought to tell the supposed duke\nnews of Cliges' discomfiture, and to rejoice thereat as the first\nhad done. But Cliges recks little of words or of listening to his\ndiscourse. He proceeds to thrust his lance in his body so that\nwhen he draws it out again the blood gushes out; and he bereaves\nhis foe of life and speech. After the two, he joins issue with a\nthird who thinks to find him overjoyed and to gladden him with\nnews of his own discomfiture. He came spurring against him; but\nbefore he has the chance to say a word, Cliges has thrust his\nlance a fathom deep into his body. To the fourth he gives such a\nblow on the neck, that he leaves him in a swoon on the field.\nAfter the fourth, he gallops against the fifth, and then after\nthe fifth, against the sixth. Of these, none stood his ground\nagainst him; rather does Cliges leave them all silent and dumb.\nStill less has he feared and more boldly sought the rest of them.\nAfter this has he no concern about these six.\n\nWhen he was free from care as regards these, he goes to make a\npresent of shame and of misfortune to the rest who are escorting\nthe maiden. He has overtaken them, and attacks them like a wolf,\nwho famished and fasting rushes on his prey. Now seems it to him\nthat he was born in a good hour, since he can display his\nchivalry and courage before her who is all his life. Now is he\ndead if he free her not; and she, on the other hand, is likewise\ndead; for she is greatly discomforted for him, but does not know\nthat he is so near her. Cliges, with feutred lance, has made a\ncharge which pleased her; and he strikes one Saxon and then\nanother so that with one single charge he has made them both bite\nthe dust, and splinters his ashen lance. The foemen fall in such\nanguish that they have no power to rise again to hurt or molest\nhim, for they were sore wounded in their bodies. The other four,\nin great wrath, go all together to strike Cliges; but he neither\nstumbles nor trembles nor have they unhorsed him. Swiftly he\nsnatches from the scabbard his sword of sharpened Steel; and that\nshe who awaits his love may be right grateful to him, he\nencounters with lightning swiftness a Saxon, and strikes him with\nhis sharp sword, so that he has severed from his trunk, his head\nand half his neck: no tenderer pity had he for him. Fenice, who\nwatches and beholds, knows not that it is Cliges. Fain would she\nthat it were he; but because there is danger she says to herself\nthat she would not wish it. For two reasons is she his good\nfriend; for she fears his death and desires his honour. And\nCliges receives at the sword's point the three who offer him\nfierce combat; they pierce and cleave his shield, but they cannot\nget him into their power or cleave the links of his shirt of\nmail. And nought that Cliges can reach stands firm before his\nblow; for he cleaves and breaks asunder all; he wheels round more\nquickly than the top which is urged on and driven by the whip.\nProwess and love entwine him and make him bold and keen in fight.\nHe has dealt so grievously with the Saxons that he has killed or\nconquered them all, wounded some, and killed others; but he let\none of them escape because they were a match, one for the other,\nand so that, by him, the duke might know his loss and mourn. But\nbefore this man left him, he prevailed upon Cliges to tell him\nhis name; and went for his part to tell it to the duke, who had\ngreat wrath thereat. Now the duke hears of his misfortune, and\nhad great grief and great care thereat. And Cliges leads away\nFenice, who thrills and tortures him with the pangs of love; but\nif now he does not hear her confession, long time will love be\nadverse to him; and also to her if she, on her side, is silent\nand say not her will; for now in the hearing, one of the other,\ncan they reveal their inmost hearts. But so much do they fear\nrefusal that they dare not betray their hearts. He fears that she\nmight reject him; she, on her part, would have betrayed herself\nif she had not feared rejection. And, nevertheless, the one\nbetrays his thoughts to the other with the eyes if they could\nonly have known it. They speak by glances with their eyes; but\nthey are so craven with their tongues that in no wise dare they\nspeak of the love which masters them. If she dare not begin it,\nit is no marvel; for a maiden ought to be a simple and shy\ncreature. But why does he wait; and why does he delay, who is\nthoroughly bold in her behalf, and has shown dread of none but\nher? God! Whence comes this fear to him that he fears a single\nmaiden, weak and timid, simple and shy? At this, methinks, I see\ndogs fleeing before the hare, and the fish hunting the beaver,\nthe lamb the wolf, the dove the eagle. So would it be if the\nvillein were to flee before his hoe by which he gains his\nlivelihood, and with which he toils. So would it be if the falcon\nwere to flee from the duck, and the gerfalcon from the heron, and\nthe great pike from the minnow, and if the stag were to chase the\nlion; so do things go topsy-turvy. But a desire comes upon me to\ngive some reason why it happens to true lovers, that wit and\ncourage fail them to express what they have in their thoughts\nwhen they have leisure and opportunity and time.\n\nYou who are being instructed in Love, who faithfully uphold the\ncustoms and rites of his court, and who never broke his law\nwhatever might have befallen you for your obedience, tell me if\none can see anything which affords Love's delight but that lovers\nshiver and grow pale thereat. Never shall there be a man opposed\nto me that I do not convince of this; for he who does not grow\npale and shiver thereat, who does not lose wit and memory like a\nthief, pursues and seeks that which is not fittingly his. A\nservant who does not fear his lord, ought not to stay in his\nretinue or serve him. He who does not esteem his lord, does not\nfear him; and he who does not esteem him, does not hold him dear;\nbut rather seeks to cheat him and to pilfer somewhat of his\nproperty. For fear ought a servant to tremble when his lord calls\nhim or sends for him. And he who commends himself to Love makes\nLove his master and his lord; and it is meet that he have him in\nReverence; and greatly fear and honour him if he wishes to stand\nwell with his court. Love without fear and without dread is fire\nwithout flame and without heat; daylight without sun; honeycomb\nwithout honey; summer without flowers; winter without frost; sky\nwithout moon; a book without letters. Thus do I wish to refute\nsuch an opponent; for where fear is lacking there is no love\nworth mentioning. It behoves him who wishes to love to fear also;\nfor if he does not he cannot love; but let him fear her only whom\nhe loves; and in her behoof let him be thoroughly bold.\nTherefore, Cliges commits no fault or wrong if he fears his\nlady-love. But for this fear he would not have failed forthwith\nto have spoken to her of love and sought her love, however the\nmatter had happed if she had not been his uncle's wife. For this\ncause his wound rankles in him; and it pains and grieves him the\nmore because he dare not say what he yearns to say.\n\nThus they return towards their company; and if they talk of\nanything, there was in their talk nothing about which they cared.\nEach sat on a white horse; and they rode quickly towards the army\nwhere there was great lamentation. Throughout the host they are\nbeside themselves with grief; but they hit upon an untrue saying\nwhen they say that Cliges is dead--thereat is the mourning very\ngreat and loud. And they fear for Fenice; they deem not that they\nwill ever have her again; and both for her and for him the whole\nhost is in very great sorrow. But these two will not delay much\nlonger; and the whole state of matters will take a different\nappearance; for already they have returned to the host and have\nturned the sorrow into joy. Joy returns and sorrow flies. They\nall come to meet them so that the whole host assembles. The two\nemperors together, when they heard the news about Cliges and\nabout the maiden, go to meet them with very great joy; but each\none longs to hear how Cliges had found and rescued the lady.\nCliges tells them the tale; and those who hear it marvel greatly\nThereat; and much do they praise his prowess and valour. But on\nthe other side the duke, who swears and protests, is furious; and\ndeclares that if Cliges dares there shall be a single combat\nbetween the two of them; and that he will order matters in such\nwise, that if Cliges wins the combat, the emperor shall go away\nin safety, and take the maiden unhindered; but that if he kills\nor conquers Cliges, who has done him many an injury, let there\nfor this be neither truce nor peace till after each has done his\nutmost. This the duke essays; and through an interpreter of his,\nwho knew Greek and German, gives the two emperors to know that\nthus he wishes to have the battle.\n\n\nThe messenger delivers his message in one and the other language\nso well that all understood. The whole host resounds and is in an\nuproar about it; and men say, that never may it please God, that\nCliges fight the battle; and both the emperors are in a very\ngreat alarm thereat; but Cliges falls at their feet and prays\nthem let it not grieve them; but that, if ever he has done aught\nthat has pleased them, he may have this battle as a guerdon and\nas a reward. And if it is denied him never will he for a single\nday be a blessing and an honour to his uncle. The emperor, who\nheld his nephew as dear as duty bade him, with his hand raises\nhim up from his knees and says: \"Fair nephew, greatly does it\ngrieve me that I know you to be so wedded to fighting; for after\njoy I expect sorrow therefrom. You have made me glad; I cannot\ndeny it; but much it grieves me to grant this boon and send you\nto the battle; for that I see you yet too young. And I know you\nto be of such proud courage that in no wise dare I deny anything\nthat it please you to ask; for know well that it would be done\nbut to please you; but if my prayer availed aught, never would\nyou take on you this burden.\" \"Sire, you are pleading in vain,\"\nquoth Cliges, \"for may God confound me if I would accept the\nwhole world on condition that I did not fight this battle. I know\nnot why I should seek from you a long respite or a long delay.\"\nThe emperor weeps with pity, and Cliges, on his side, weeps with\njoy when he grants him the battle. There had he wept many a\njoyful tear, nor had he secured delay, nor limit of time, before\nit was the hour of Prime; by his own messenger was the battle\nannounced to the duke, just as he had demanded it.\n\nThe duke, who thinks and believes and imagines that Cliges will\nnot be able to defend himself against him, but that he will soon\nhave slain or conquered him, quickly has himself armed. Cliges,\nwho is longing for the battle, thinks that he need have no care\nas to how to defend himself against the duke. He asks the emperor\nfor arms, and prays him to dub him knight; and, of his grace, the\nemperor gives him arms and Cliges takes them; for his heart is\nenamoured of the battle and much does he desire and long for it.\nHe hastens full swiftly to arm himself; when he was armed from\nhead to foot, the emperor, who was full of anxiety, goes to gird\nthe sword on his side. Cliges mounts on the white Arab, fully\narmed; from his neck he hangs by the straps a shield made of\nelephant's bone, such that it will neither break nor split nor\nhad it blazon or device; the armour was all white, and the steed\nand the harness were all whiter than any snow.\n\nCliges and the duke are armed, and the one has announced to the\nother that they will meet half-way, and that, on both sides,\ntheir men shall all be without swords and without lances, bound\nby oaths and their word of honour that never, as long as the\ncombat shall last, will there be any so bold as to dare to move\nfor any reason, any more than he would dare to pluck out his own\neye. Bound by this covenant they have met, and the delay has\nseemed very long to each champion; for each thinks to have the\nglory and the joy of victory. But before there was a blow struck,\nthe maiden, who is much concerned for Cliges, has herself\nescorted thither; but on this is she quite resolved: that if he\ndies, she will die. Never will any hope of consolation avail to\ndeter her from dying with him; for without him life has no charm\nfor her.\n\nWhen all had come into the field, high and low, young and hoary,\nand the guards bad been set there, then have both champions taken\ntheir lances; and they meet in no half-hearted way, so that each\nbreaks his lance, and both are unhorsed and fail to keep their\nsaddles. But quickly have they risen to their feet, for they were\nnot at all wounded, and again they encounter without delay. They\nplay a merry tune with their swords on the resounding helms, so\nthat their retinue are amazed; and it seems to those who watch\nthem that the helmets are on fire and ablaze. And when the swords\nrebound, glowing sparks jet forth as from red-hot iron which the\nsmith hammers on the anvil when he draws it from the furnace.\nVery lavish are both the warriors in dealing blows in great\nStore; and each has a good will to pay back quickly what he\nborrows; neither the one nor the other ceases from paying back\ncapital and interest immediately, all without count and without\nstint. But the duke comes on in great anger, and right wroth and\nfurious is he because he has not quelled and slain Cliges at the\nfirst encounter. He deals him a great blow, marvellous and\nstrong, such that at his feet Cliges has fallen on one knee.\n\nAt the blow whereby Cliges fell was the emperor much amazed; he\nwas no whit less bewildered than if he had been behind the shield\nhimself. Then Fenice, so much was she amazed, can no longer\nrestrain herself, whatever might come of it, from crying: \"God!\nAid!\" as loud as ever she could. But she had called out but one\nword when, forthwith, her voice failed, and she fell swooning,\nand with arms outstretched so that her face was a little wounded.\nTwo noble barons raised her, and have held her on her feet till\nshe has returned to her senses. But never did any who saw her,\nwhatever appearance she presented, know why she swooned. Never\ndid any man blame her for it; rather they have all praised her;\nfor there is not a single one who does not believe that she would\nhave done the same for his sake if he had been in Cliges' place;\nbut in all this there is no truth. Cliges, when Fenice cried,\nheard and marked her right well. The sound restored to him\nstrength and courage, and be springs swiftly to his feet, and\nadvanced furiously to meet the duke, and thrusts at him, and\npresses him so that the duke was amazed thereat; for he finds him\nmore greedy for combat, more strong and agile than he had found\nhim before, it seems to him, when they first encountered. And\nbecause he fears his onset he says to him: \"Knight, so may God\nsave me, I see thee right courageous and valiant. But if it had\nnot been for my nephew, whom I shall never forget, willingly\nwould I have made peace with thee, and would have released thee\nfrom the quarrel; for never would I have meddled any more in the\nmatter.\" \"Duke,\" says Cliges, \"what may be your pleasure? Is it\nnot meet that he who cannot make good his claim yield it, one of\ntwo evils; when one has to choose, one ought to choose the\nlesser. When your nephew picked a quarrel with me, he acted\nunwisely. I will serve you in the same way--be assured of it--if\nI ever can, if I do not receive submission from you.\" The duke,\nto whom it seems that Cliges was growing in strength every\nmoment, thinks that it is much better for him to stop short\nhalf-way before he is altogether wearied out. Nevertheless, he\ndoes not confess to him the truth quite openly, but he says:\n\"Knight, I see thee debonair and agile and of great courage. But\nexceeding young art thou: for this reason I reflect, and I know\nof a surety, that if I conquer and kill thee, never should I win\npraise or esteem thereby, nor should I ever see any man of valour\nin whose hearing I should dare to confess that I had fought with\nthee, for I should do honour to thee and shame to myself. But if\nthose knowst what honour means, a great honour will it be to thee\nfor ever that thou hast stood thy ground against me, even for two\nencounters only. Now a wish and desire has come to me, to release\nthee from the quarrel and not to fight with thee any longer.\"\n\"Duke,\" quoth Cliges, \"you talk idly. You shall say it aloud in\nthe hearing of all, and never shall it be told or related that\nyou have done me a kindness, or that you have had mercy on me. In\nthe hearing of one and all of these who are here, you will have\nto declare it if you wish to make peace with me.\" The duke\ndeclares it in the hearing of all. Thus have they made peace and\nagreement; but whatever the issue of the matter, Cliges had the\nhonour and the renown of it; and the Greeks had very great joy\nthereof. But the Saxons could not make light of the matter; for\nwell had they all seen their lord exhausted and worsted; nor is\nthere any question but that, if he had been able to do better for\nhimself, this peace would never have been made; rather would he\nhave rent the soul out of Cliges' body if he had been able to do\nit.\n\nThe duke returns to Saxony, grieved and downcast and Ashamed; for\nof his men--there are not two who do not hold him a conquered\nman, a craven, and a coward. The Saxons, with all their shame,\nhave returned to Saxony. And the Greeks delay no longer; they\nreturn towards Constantinople with great joy and with great\ngladness; for well by his prowess has Cliges assured to them the\nway. Now the emperor of Germany no further follows or attends\nthem. After taking leave of the Greek folk and of his daughter\nand of Cliges and of the emperor, he has remained in Germany; and\nthe emperor of the Greeks goes away right glad and right joyful.\nCliges, the valiant, the well-bred, thinks of his father's\ncommand. If his uncle the emperor will grant him leave, he will\ngo to request and pray him to let him go to Britain to speak to\nhis uncle the king; for he craves to know and see him. He sets\nout for the presence of the emperor, and begs him if it please\nhim to let him go to Britain to see his uncle and his friends.\nVery gently has he made this request; but his uncle refuses it to\nhim when he has heard and listened to the whole of his request\nand his story. \"Fair nephew,\" quoth he, \"it pleases me not that\nyou should wish to leave me. Never will I give you this leave or\nthis permission without great grief; for right pleasant and\nconvenient is it that you should be my partner and co-ruler with\nme of all my empire.\"\n\nNow there is nothing which pleases Cliges, since his uncle denies\nhim what he asks and requests; and he says: \"Fair Sire, it\nbecomes me not, nor am I brave or wise enough to be given this\npartnership with you or with another so as to rule an empire;\nvery young am I and know but little. For this reason is gold\napplied to the touchstone because one wishes to know if it is\nreal gold. So wish I--that is the end and sum of it--to assay and\nprove myself where I think to find the touchstone. In Britain if\nI am valiant I shall be able to put myself to the touch with the\nWhetstone; and with the true and genuine assay by which I shall\ntest my prowess. In Britain are those valiant men of whom honour\nand prowess boast. And he who wishes to gain honour, ought to\njoin himself to their company; for there the honour resides and\nis won which appertains to the man of valour. Therefore, I ask\nyou this leave; and know of a surety that if you do not send me\nthither and do not grant me the boon, then I shall go without\nyour leave.\" \"Fair nephew, rather do I give it you freely when I\nsee you thus minded; for I would not have the heart to detain you\nby force or by prayer. Now may God give you heart and will to\nreturn soon since neither prayer nor prohibition nor force could\nprevail in the matter. I would have you take with you a talent of\ngold and of silver, and horses to delight you will I give you,\nall at your choice.\" No sooner had he said his word than Cliges\nhas bowed to him. All whatsoever the emperor has devised and\npromised was at once set before him. Cliges took as much wealth\nand as many comrades as pleased and behoved him; but for his own\nprivate use he takes away four different steeds: one white, one\nsorrel, one dun, one black. But I was about to pass over one\nthing that must not be omitted. Cliges goes to take leave of\nFenice, his lady-love, and to ask her leave to depart; for he\nwould fain commend her to God. He comes before her and kneels\ndown, weeping, so that he moistens with his tears all his tunic\nand his ermine, and he bends his eyes to the ground; for he dares\nnot look straight in front of him, just as if he has committed\nsome wrong and crime towards her, and now shows by his mien that\nhe has shame for it. And Fenice, who beholds him timidly and\nshyly, knows not what matter brings him; and she has said to him\nin some distress: \"Friend, fair sir, rise; sit by my side; weep\nno more and tell me your pleasure.\" \"Lady! What shall I say? What\nconceal? I seek your permission to depart.\" \"Depart? Why?\"\n\n\"Lady! I must go away to Britain.\" \"Tell me, then, on what quest,\nbefore I give you permission.\" \"Lady, my father, when he died and\ndeparted this life, prayed me on no account to fail to go to\nBritain as soon as I should be a knight. For nothing in the world\nwould I neglect his command. It will behove me not to play the\nlaggard as I go thither. It is a very long journey from here to\nGreece; and if I were to go thither the journey from\nConstantinople to Britain would be very long for me. But it is\nmeet that I take leave of you as being the lady whose I am\nwholly.\" Many hidden and secret sighs and sobs had he made on\nsetting out; but no one had eyes so wide open or such good\nhearing as to be able to perceive for a certainty from hearing or\nsight, that there was love between the twain. Cliges, grievous\nthough it be to him, departs as soon as it is allowed him. He\ngoes away lost in thought; lost in thought remains the emperor\nand many another; but Fenice is the most pensive of all: she\ndiscovers neither bottom nor bound to the thought with which she\nis filled, so greatly does it overflow and multiply in her. Full\nof thought she has come to Greece: there was she held in great\nhonour as lady and empress; but her heart and spirit are with\nCliges wherever he turns, nor ever seeks she that her heart may\nreturn to her unless he bring it back to her, he who is dying of\nthe malady with which he has slain her. And if he recovers, she\nwill recover; never will he pay dear for it unless she too pay\ndear. Her malady appears in her complexion; for much has she\nchanged and pale has she grown. The fresh, clear, pure hue that\nNature had bestowed has wholly deserted her face. Often she\nweeps, often sighs: little recks she of her empire and of the\nwealth she has. She has always in her memory the hour that Cliges\ndeparted, the farewell that he took of her, how he changed\ncountenance, how he blanched, his tears and his mien, for he came\nto weep before her, humble, lowly, and on his knees, as if he\nmust needs worship her. All this is pleasant and sweet for her to\nrecall and to retrace. Then to provide herself with a luscious\nmorsel, she takes on her tongue in lieu of spice a sweet word;\nand for all Greece she would not wish that he who said that word\nshould, in the sense in which she took it, have intended deceit;\nfor she lives on no other dainty nor does aught else please her.\nThis word alone sustains and feeds her and soothes for her all\nher suffering. She seeks not to feed herself or quench her thirst\nwith any other meat or drink; for when it came to the parting,\nCliges said that he was \"wholly hers\". This word is so sweet and\ngood to her, that from the tongue it goes to her heart; and she\nstores it in her heart as well as in her mouth, that she may be\nthe surer of it. She dares not hide this treasure behind any\nother lock; and she would never be able to store it elsewhere so\nwell as in her heart. In no wise will she ever take it thence so\nmuch she fears thieves and robbers; but it is without reason that\nthis fear comes to her; and without reason that she fears birds\nof prey, for this possession is immovable; rather is it like a\nbuilding which cannot be destroyed by flood or by fire, and which\nwill never move from its place. But this she knows not, and hence\nshe gives herself agony and pain to seek out and learn something\non which she can lay hold; for in divers fashions does she\nexplain it. She holds debate within herself; and makes such\nreplies as these: \"With what intention did Cliges say to me 'I am\nwholly yours' if love did not cause him to say it? With what\npower of mine can I sway him, that he should esteem me so highly\nas to make me his lady? Is he not fairer than I, of much nobler\nbirth than I? I see nought but his love that can bestow on me\nthis gift. From my own case, for I cannot evade the scrutiny, I\nwill prove, that if he had not loved me he would never have\ncalled himself wholly mine; for just as I could not be wholly\nhis, nor could in honour say so if love had not drawn me to him,\nso Cliges, on his side, could not in any wise have said that he\nwas wholly mine if love has him not in his bonds. For if he loves\nme not, he fears me not. Love, which gives me wholly to him,\nperhaps, gives him wholly to me; but this thought quite dismays\nme, that the phrase is one in common use and I may easily be\ndeceived; for many a man there is who in flattery says, even to\nstrangers: 'I am quite at your service, I, and whatsoever I\nhave.' And such men are more mocking than jays. So I know not\nwhat to think; for it might well be that thus he spake to flatter\nme. But I saw him change colour and weep right piteously. To my\nmind his tears, his shamefaced and cast-down countenance, did not\ncome from deceit; no deceit or trickery was there. The eyes from\nwhich I saw the tears fall did not lie to me. Signs enow could I\nsee there of love if I know aught of the matter. Yea! I grant\nthat evil was the hour in which I thought it. Evil was the hour\nthat I learnt it, and stored it in my heart; for a very great\nmisfortune has happed to me from it. A misfortune? Truly, by my\nfaith! I am dead, since I see not him who has flattered and\ncajoled me so much that he has robbed me of my heart. Through his\ndeceit and smooth words, my heart is quitting its lodging and\nwill not stay with me, so much it hates my dwelling and my manor.\nFaith! then, he who has my heart in his keeping has dealt ill\nwith me. He who robs me and takes away what is mine, loves me\nnot; I know it well. I know it? Why then did he weep? Why? It was\nnot for nothing, for he had reason enow. I ought to apply nought\nof it to myself because a man's sorrow is very great at parting\nfrom those whom he loves and knows. I marvel not that he had\ngrief and sorrow, and that he wept when he left his\nacquaintances. But he who gave him this counsel to go and stay in\nBritain could have found no better means of wounding me to the\nheart. One who loses his heart is wounded to the heart. He who\ndeserves sorrow ought to have it; but I never deserved it. Alas!\nUnhappy that I am! Why, then, has Cliges slain me without any\nfault of mine? But in vain do I reproach him; for I have no\ngrounds for this reproach. Cliges would never, never, have\nforsaken me--I know this well--if his heart had been in like case\nwith mine. In like case I think it is not. And if my heart has\njoined itself to his heart, never will it leave it, never will\nhis go whither without mine; for mine follows him in secret so\nclose is the comradeship that they have formed. But to tell the\ntruth the two hearts are very different and contrary. How are\nthey different and contrary? His is lord, and mine is slave; and\nthe slave, even against his own will, must do what is for his\nlord's good and leave out of sight all else. But what matters it\nto me? He cares nought for my heart or for my service. This\ndivision grieves me much; for thus the one heart is lord of the\ntwo. Why cannot mine, all alone, avail as much as his with him?\nThus the two would have been of equal strength. My heart is a\nprisoner; for it cannot move unless his moves. And if his wanders\nor tarries, mine ever prepares to follow and go after him. God!\nWhy are not our bodies so near that I could in some way have\nfetched my heart back? Have fetched it back? Poor fool! If I were\nto take it from where it is lodged so comfortably, I might kill\nit by so doing. Let it stay there. Never do I seek to remove it;\nrather do I will that it stay with its lord until pity for it\ncome to him; for rather there than here will he be bound to have\nmercy on his servant because the two hearts are in a strange\nland. If my heart knows how to serve up flattery as one is bound\nto serve it up at court, it will be rich before it returns. He\nwho wishes to be on good terms with his lord and to sit beside\nhim on his right, as is now the use and custom, must feign to\npluck the feather from his lord's head, even when there is no\nfeather there. But here we see an evil trait: when he flatters\nhim to his face, and yet his lord has in his heart either\nbaseness or villainy, never will he be so courteous as to tell\nhim the truth; rather he makes him think and believe that no one\ncould be a match for him in prowess or in knowledge; and the lord\nthinks that the courtier is telling the truth. He who believes\nanother anent some quality which he does not possess knows\nhimself ill; for even if he is faithless and stubborn, base and\nas cowardly as a hare, niggardly and foolish and malformed,\nworthless in deeds and in words, yet many a man who mocks at him\nbehind his back, extols and praises him to his face; thus then\nthe courtier praises him in his hearing when he speaks of him to\nanother; and yet he pretends that the lord does not hear what\nthey are speaking about together, whereas if he really thought\nthat the lord did not hear, he would never say aught whereat his\nmaster would rejoice. And if his lord wishes to lie, he is quite\nready with his assent; and whatever his lord says, he asserts to\nbe true; never will he who associates with courts and lords be\ntongue-tied; his tongue must serve them with falsehood. My heart\nmust needs do likewise if it wishes to have grace of its lord;\nlet it be a flatterer and cajoler. But Cliges is such a brave\nknight, so handsome, so noble, and so loyal, that never will my\nheart be lying or false, however much it may praise him; for in\nhim is nothing that can be mended. Therefore, I will that my\nheart serve him; for the peasant says in his proverb: 'He who\ncommends himself to a good man is base if he does not become\nbetter in his service'.\" Thus Love works on Fenice. But this\ntorment is delight to her, for she cannot be wearied by it.\n\nAnd Cliges has crossed the sea and has come to Wallingford. There\nhe has demeaned himself in lordly fashion in a fine lodging at a\ngreat cost, but he thinks ever of Fenice; never does he forget\nher for an hour. In the place where he sojourns and tarries, his\nretinue, as he had commanded, have inquired and questioned\npersistently till they heard told and related that the barons of\nKing Arthur and the king, himself, in person, had set on foot a\ntournament in the plains before Oxford which is near Wallingford.\nIn such wise was the joust arranged that it was to last four\ndays. But Cliges will be able to take time to arm his body if he\nlacks anything meanwhile; for there were more than fifteen whole\ndays to the tournament. He speedily sends three of his squires to\nLondon, and bids them buy three different sets of armour: one\nblack, another red, the third green; and as they return he bids\nthat each set of arms be covered with new canvas, so that if\nanyone meets them on the way he may not know what will be the hue\nof the arms which they will bring. The squires now set out, 90 to\nLondon, and find ready all such equipment as they seek. Soon had\nthey finished, soon did they return; they have come back as soon\nas they could. They show to Cliges the arms that they had\nbrought; and he praises them much. With these that the emperor\ngave him on the Danube when he dubbed him knight, he has them\nstored away and hidden. If anyone now were to ask me why he had\nthem stored away, I would not answer him; for in due time it will\nbe told and related to you, when all the high barons of the land\nwho will come there to gain fame will be mounted on their steeds.\nOn the day that was devised and appointed, the barons of renown\nassemble. King Arthur, together with the lords whom he had chosen\nfrom out the good knights, lay before Oxford. Towards Wallingford\nwent the greater part of his chivalry. Think not that I tell you\nin order to spin out my tale: such and such kings were there,\nsuch and such counts, and such and such others. When the barons\nwere to meet, a knight of great prowess of King Arthur's peers\nrode out all alone between the two ranks to begin the tourney, as\nwas the custom at that time. But none dares ride forward to come\nand joust against him. There is none who does not stay where he\nis; and yet there are some who ask: \"Why do these knights wait?\nWhy does none ride forth from the ranks? Surely someone will\nstraightway begin.\" And on the other side they say: \"See ye not\nwhat a champion our adversaries have sent us from their side? Let\nhim who has not yet known it know that, of the four bravest\nknown, this is a pillar equal to the rest.\" \"Who is he, then?\"\n\"See ye him not? It is Sagremors the Lawless.\" \"Is it he?\"\n\"Truly, without doubt.\" Cliges, who hears and hearkens to this,\nsat on Morel, and had armour blacker than a ripe mulberry: his\nwhole armour was black. He separates himself from the others in\nthe rank and spurs Morel who comes out of the row; not one is\nthere who sees him but says to his neighbour: \"This man rides\nwell with feutred lance; here have we a very skilful knight; he\nbears his arms in the right fashion; well does the shield at his\nneck become him. But one cannot but hold him mad as regards the\njoust he has undertaken of his own accord against one of the\nbravest known in all this land. But who is he? Of what land is he\na native? Who knows him?\" \"Not I!\" \"Nor I!\" \"But no snow has\nfallen on him! Rather is his armour blacker than monk's or\npriest's cape.\" Thus they engage in gossip; and the two champions\nlet their horses go; for no longer do they delay because right\neager and aflame are they for the encounter and the shock. Cliges\nstrikes so that he presses Sagremors' shield to his arm, and his\narm to his body. Sagremors falls at full length; Cliges acts\nirreproachably, and makes him declare himself prisoner: Sagremors\ngives his parole. Now the fight begins, and they charge in\nrivalry. Cliges has rushed to the combat, and goes seeking joust\nand encounter. He encounters no knight whom he does not take or\nlay low. On both sides he wins the highest distinction; for where\nhe rides to joust, he brings the whole tourney to a standstill.\nYet he who gallops up to joust with him is not without great\nprowess; but he wins more renown for standing his ground against\nCliges than for taking prisoner another knight; and if Cliges\nleads him away captive, yet he enjoys great distinction for\nmerely daring to withstand him in the joust. Cliges has the\npraise and distinction of the whole tournament. And even secretly\nhe has returned to his lodging so that none of them might accost\nhim about one thing or another. And in case any one should have\nsearch made for the lodging marked by the black arms, he locks\nthem up in a room so that they may neither be found nor seen; and\nhe has the green arms openly displayed at the door, fronting the\nroad so that the passers by shall see them. And if any asks for\nhim and seeks him, he will not know where his lodging will be,\nsince he will see no sign of the black shield that he seeks. Thus\nCliges is in the town and hides himself by such a device. And\nthose who were his prisoners went from end to end of the town\nasking for the black knight; but none could tell them where he\nwas. And even King Arthur sends up and down to seek him; but all\nsay: \"We did not see him after we left the tourney and know not\nwhat became of him.\" More than twenty youths whom the king has\nsent seek him; but Cliges has so utterly blotted out his tracks\nthat they find no sign of him. King Arthur crosses himself when\nit was recounted and told him, that neither great nor small is\nfound who can point out his dwelling any more than if he were at\nQesarea, or at Toledo, or in Candia. \"Faith!\" quoth he, \"I know\nnot what to say in the matter, but I marvel greatly thereat. It\nwas perhaps a ghost that has moved among us. Many a knight has he\noverthrown today; and he bears away the parole of the noblest men\nwho will not this year see home or land or country; and each of\nwhom will have broken his oath.\" Thus the king spake his pleasure\nthough he might very well have kept silence in the matter.\n\nMuch have all the barons spoken that night of the black knight,\nfor they spoke of nought else. On the morrow they returned to\narms, all without summons and without entreaty. Lancelot of the\nLake has dashed forth to make the first joust; for no coward is\nhe; with upright lance he awaits the joust. Lo! Cliges, greener\nthan meadow grass, galloping on a dun, long-maned steed. Where\nCliges pricks on the tawny steed, there is none, whether decked\nwith youth's luxuriant locks or bald, who does not behold him\nwith wonder; and they say on both sides: \"This man is in all\nrespects much nobler and more skilful than he of yesterday with\nthe black arms, just as the pine is fairer than the beech, and\nthe laurel than the elder. But not yet have we learned who he of\nyesterday was; but we will learn this very day who this one is.\nIf anyone know it, let him tell us.\" Each said: \"I know him not,\nnever did I see him before to my thinking. But he is fairer than\nthe knight of yesterday and fairer than Lancelot of the Lake. If\nhe were arrayed in a sack and Lancelot in silver and gold, yet\nthis man would still be fairer.\" Thus all side with Cliges; and\nthe two prick their steeds as fast as they can spur and encounter\none another. Cliges proceeds to deal such a blow on the golden\nshield with the painted lion, that he hurls its bearer from the\nsaddle and fell on him in order to receive his submission.\nLancelot could not defend himself and has given his parole. Then\nthe noise and the din and the crash of lances has begun. Those\nwho were on Cliges' side have all their trust in him; for he whom\nhe strikes after due challenge given will never be so strong but\nthat he must needs fall from his horse to the ground. Cliges,\nthis day, wrought so bravely, and threw down and captured so\nmany, that he has pleased those on his side twice as much, and\nhas had twice as much praise from them as he had the day before.\nWhen evening has come he has repaired to his lodging as quickly\nas he could; and speedily bids the red shield and the other\narmour be brought forth. He orders that the arms which he bore\nthat day be stowed away; the landlord has carefully done it. Long\nhave the knights whom he had captured sought him that night\nAgain; but no news do they hear of him. The greater part of those\nwho speak of him at the inns laud and praise him.\n\nNext day the knights return to arms, alert and strong. From the\narray before Oxford rides out a knight of great renown; Percival\nthe Welshman, was he called. As soon as Cliges saw him ride forth\nand heard the truth as to his name--for he heard him called\nPercival--he greatly longs to encounter him. Forthwith has he\nridden forth from the rank on a sorrel, Spanish steed; and his\narmour was red. Then they, one and all, regard him with great\nwonder, more than they ever did before and say that never before\ndid they see so comely a knight. And the two prick forward at\nonce; for there was no delay. And the one and the other spurs on\nso that they give and take mighty blows on their shields. The\nlances, which were short and thick, bend and curve. In the sight\nof all who were looking on, Cliges has struck Percival, so that\nhe smites him down from his horse, and makes him give parole\nwithout much fighting, and without great ado. When Percival had\nsubmitted, then they have begun the tourney; and they all\nencounter together. Cliges encounters no knight but he fells him\nto the ground. On this day one could not see him a single hour\nabsent from the fight. Each for himself strikes a blow at Cliges\nas though at a tower: not merely two or three strike, for then\nthat was not the use or custom. Cliges has made an anvil of his\nshield; for all play the smith and hammer upon it and cleave and\nquarter it; but none strikes upon it but Cliges pays him back,\nand throws him from his stirrups and saddle; and no one, except a\nman who wished to lie, could have said on his departure that the\nknight with the red shield had not won that whole day. And the\nbest and most courteous would fain have his acquaintances, but\nthat cannot be so soon; for he has gone away, secretly, when he\nsaw that the sun had set; and he has had his red shield and all\nhis other armour taken away; and he has the white arms brought in\nwhich he had been newly knighted; and the arms and the steed were\nplaced in front of the door. But now they begin to perceive (for\nthe greater part who speak of it say so, and perceive it to be\nso), that they have all been discomfited, and put to flight by a\nsingle man, who each day changes his outward show, both horse and\narmour, and seems another than himself; they have now for the\nfirst time perceived it. And my lord Gawain has said that never\nbefore did he see such a jouster; and because he would fain have\nhis acquaintance and know his name, he says that he will be first\ntomorrow at the encounter of the knights. But he makes no boast;\nrather he says that he thinks and believes that Cliges will have\nthe best of it and will win the renown when they strike with\nlances; but with the sword, perhaps, Cliges will not be his\nmaster; for never could Gawain find his master. Now will he prove\nhimself tomorrow on the strange knight, who every day dons\ndifferent armour and changes horse and harness. Soon he will be a\nbird of many moltings if thus daily he makes a practice of taking\noff his old feathers and putting on new ones. And thus Gawain too\ndoffed his armour, and put on other, and the morrow he sees\nCliges return, whiter than lily-flower, his shield held by the\nstraps behind it, on his trusty, white, Arab steed, as he had\ndevised the night before. Gawain, the valiant, the renowned, has\nnot gone to sleep on the field; but pricks, and spurs, and\nadvances, and puts forth all his utmost efforts to joust well if\nhe finds any with whom to joust. Soon both will be on the field\nfor Cliges had no wish to delay; for he had heard the murmur of\nthose who say: \"It is Gawain who is no weakling, afoot or on\nhorseback. It is he with whom none dares to measure himself.\"\nCliges, who hears the words, charges into the middle of the field\ntowards him; both advance and encounter with a spring more swift\nthan that of a stag who hears the baying of dogs barking after\nhim. The  lances strike on the shields; and so mighty is the\ncrash of the blows, that to their very ends they shatter into\nsplinters, and split, and go to pieces; and the saddle-bows\nbehind, break; moreover, the saddle-girth and breast harness\nburst. They both alike fall to the ground and have drawn their\nnaked swords. The folk have pressed round to behold the battle.\nKing Arthur came in front of all to separate and reconcile them;\nbut they had broken and hewn in pieces the white hauberks, and\nhad cleft through and cut up the shields, and had fractured the\nhelmets before there was any talk of peace.\n\n\nThe king had gazed at them as long a time as it pleased him; and\nso did many of the others who said that they esteemed the white\nknight no whit less in arms than my lord Gawain; and up till now\nthey could not say which was the better, which the worse, nor\nwhich would overcome the other if they were allowed to fight till\nthe battle was fought out. But it does not please or suit the\nking that they do more than they have done. He advances to part\nthem and says to them: \"Withdraw! If another blow be struck, it\nwill be to your harm. But make peace. Be friends. Fair nephew\nGawain, I entreat you; for it does not become a valiant man to\ncontinue a battle or fight where he has no quarrel or hatred. But\nif this knight would come to my court to pass his time with us,\nit would be no grievance or hurt to him. Pray him to do so,\nnephew.\" \"Willingly, Sire.\" Cliges seeks not to excuse himself\nfrom this; willingly he consents to go thither when the tourney\nshall end; for now he has carried out to the uttermost his\nfather's command. And the king says that he cares not for a\ntournament which lasts long; well may they straightway leave it.\nThe knights have dispersed, for the king wishes and commands it.\nCliges sends for all his armour, for it behoves him to follow the\nking. With all speed he may have, he comes to the court; but he\nwas attired well beforehand and garbed after the French fashion.\n\nAs soon as he came to court each hastens to meet him, for neither\none nor the other remains behind; rather they manifest the\ngreatest possible joy and festivity. And all those whom he had\ntaken in the jousting acclaim him lord; but it is his wish to\ndisclaim it to all of them; and he says, that if they think and\nbelieve that it was he who took them, they are all absolved of\ntheir pledge. There is not a single one who did not say: \"It was\nyou, well we know it. We prize highly your acquaintance, and much\nought we to love you, and esteem you, and acclaim you, lord, for\nnone of us is a match for you. Just as the sun puts out the\nlittle stars, so that their light is not visible in the clouds\nwhere the rays of the sun shine forth, so our deeds pale and wane\nbefore yours; and yet our deeds were wont to be greatly renowned\nthroughout the world.\" Cliges knows not what reply to make to\nthem; for it seems to him that one and all of them praise him\nmore than they ought. Though it is very pleasant to him yet he is\nashamed of it. The blood rises into his face, so that they see\nhim all ashamed. They escort him through the hall, and have led\nhim before the king; but they all cease to address to him the\nlanguage of praise and flattery. Now was it the set hour for\neating, and those whose business it was, hastened to set the\ntables. They have set the tables in the palace: some have taken\nnapkins, and others hold basins and give water to those who come.\nAll have washed; all are seated. The king has taken Cliges by the\nhand and set him before him; for fain will he know this very day\nwho he is, if at all he may. No need is there to speak of the\nfood, for the dishes were as plentiful as though one could have\npurchased an ox for a farthing.\n\nWhen all had had their meat and drink, then has the king no\nlonger kept silence. \"Friend,\" quoth he, \"I would know if it is\nfrom pride that you forbore and disdained to come to my court as\nsoon as you entered this land, and why you thus withdraw yourself\nfrom folk and change your arms. Now impart to me your name, and\nsay of what race you are born.\" Cliges replies: \"Never shall it\nbe concealed.\" He has told and related to the king whatsoever he\ndemands from him; and when the king has learned his name then he\nembraces him; then he rejoices over him; there is none who does\nnot greet him in clue form. And my Lord Gawain knew him, who,\nabove all, embraces and greets him. All greet him and fall on his\nneck; and all those who speak of him say that he is right fair\nand valiant. The king loves him and honours him more than any of\nall his nephews.\n\nCliges stays with the king until the beginning of summer; by that\ntime he has been over all Britain and over France and over\nNormandy, and has wrought many a knightly deed, so that he has\nwell proved himself. But the love with which he is wounded grows\nneither lighter nor easier. The wish of his heart keeps him ever\nconstant to one thought: he remembers Fenice who far from him is\ntorturing her heart. A longing seizes him to return home; for too\nlong has he abstained from seeing the lady more yearned for than\nany lady, that ever heard of man has yearned for. And he will not\nabstain longer from her. He prepares for the journey to Greece;\nhe has taken leave and returns. Much, I ween, did it grieve my\nlord Gawain and the king when they can no longer keep him. But he\nlongs to reach her whom he loves and desires; and he hastens o'er\nsea and land; and the way seems very long to him, so eagerly does\nhe yearn to see her who takes away and purloins his heart from\nhim. But she yields him a fair return; and well does she pay and\ncompensate him for the toll she has extorted from him; for she in\nher turn gives her own heart in payment to him, whom she loves no\nless. But he is not a whit certain about it; never had he pledge\nor promise in the matter; and he grieves cruelly. And she also\nlaments; for her love of him is tormenting and killing her; and\nnothing can give pleasure or joy in her eyes since that hour when\nshe ceased to see him. She does not even know if he is alive,\nwhereof great sorrow strikes her to the heart. But Cliges gets\nnearer each day, and in his journey he has had good luck; for he\nhas had a fair wind and calm weather, and has anchored with joy\nand delight before Constantinople. The news reached the city; it\nwas welcome to the emperor and a hundred times more welcome to\nthe empress. If anyone doubt this it will be to his own sorrow.\nCliges and his company have repaired to Greece, straight to the\nport of Constantinople. All the most powerful and noble come to\nthe port to meet him. And when the emperor who had advanced in\nfront of all meets him, and the empress who walks by his side,\nthe emperor, before all, runs to fall on his neck and to greet\nhim. And when Fenice greets him, the one changes colour because\nof the other; and the marvel is how when they come close to each\nother they keep from embracing and kissing each other with such\nkisses as please Love. But folly would it have been and madness.\nThe folk run up in all directions and delight to see him. They\nall lead him through the midst of the town, some on foot and some\non horseback, as far as the imperial palace. Of the joy that\nthere was made will never word here be told, nor of the honour,\nnor of the homage; but each has striven to do whatever he thinks\nand believes will please Cliges and be welcome to him. And his\nuncle yields to him all that he has save the crown. He is right\nwilling that Cliges take at his pleasure whatsoever he shall wish\nto obtain from him, be it land or treasure; but Cliges makes no\naccount of silver or of gold, since he dare not disclose his\nthought to her for whom he loses his rest; and yet he has leisure\nand opportunity for telling her if only he were not afraid of\nbeing refused; for every day he can see her and sit alone by her\nside without anyone gainsaying or forbidding; for nobody imagines\nor thinks evil of it.\n\nA space of time after he had returned, one day he came unattended\ninto the room of her who was not forsooth his enemy, and be well\nassured that the door was not shut against the meeting. He was\nclose by her side and all the rest had gone away, so that no one\nwas sitting near them who could hear their words. Fenice first of\nall questioned him about Britain. She asks him concerning the\ndisposition and courtesy of my lord Gawain, and at last she\nventures to speak of what she dreaded. She asked him if he loved\ndame or maiden in that land. To this Cliges was not unwilling or\nslow to reply. Quickly was he able to explain all to her, as soon\nas she challenged him on the point. \"Lady,\" quoth he, \"I was in\nlove while yonder; but I loved none who was of yonder land. In\nBritain my body was without a heart like bark without timber.\nWhen I left Germany, I knew not what became of my heart, save\nthat it went away hither after you. Here was my heart and there\nmy body. I was not absent from Greece, for my heart had gone\nthither, and to reclaim it have I come back here; but it neither\ncomes nor returns to me, and I cannot bring it back to me, and\nyet I seek it not and cannot do so. And how have you fared since\nyou have come into this land? What joy have you had here? Do the\npeople, does the land please you? I ought to ask you nothing\nfurther save this--whether the land please you.\" \"Formerly it\npleased me not; but now there dawns for me a joy and a pleasure\nthat I would not lose, be assured, for Pavia or for Placentia;\nfor I cannot dissever my heart from it, nor shall I ever use\nforce to do so. In me is there nought save the bark, for without\nmy heart I live and have my being. Never was I in Britain, and\nyet my heart has made I know not what contract in Britain without\nme.\" \"Lady, when was your heart there? Tell me when it went, at\nwhat time and at what season, if it is a matter that you can\nreasonably tell me or another. Was it there when I was there?\"\n\"Yes, but you knew it not. It was there as long as you were there\nand departed with you.\" \"God! and I neither knew nor saw it\nthere. God! why did I know it not? If I had known it, certainly,\nlady, I would have borne it good company.\" \"Much would you have\ncomforted me and well would it have become you to do so, for I\nwould have been very gracious to your heart, if it had pleased it\nto come there where it might have known me to be.\" \"Of a surety,\nlady, it came to you.\" \"To me? Then it came not into exile, for\nmine also went to you.\" \"Lady, then are both our hearts here with\nus as you say; for mine is wholly yours.\" \"Friend, and you on\nyour side have mine, and so we are well matched. And know well\nthat, so may God guard me, never had your uncle share in me, for\nneither did it please me nor was it permitted to him. Never yet\ndid he know me as Adam knew his wife. Wrongly am I called dame;\nbut I know well that he who calls me dame knows not that I am a\nmaid. Even your uncle knows it not, for he has drunk of the\nsleeping draught and thinks he is awake when he sleeps, and he\ndeems that he has his joy of me, just as he fain would have it,\nand just as though I were lying between his arms; but well have I\nshut him out. Yours is my heart, yours is my body, nor indeed\nwill any one by my example learn to act vilely; for when my heart\nset itself on you, it gave and promised you my body, so that\nnobody else shall have a share in it. Love for you so wounded me\nthat never did I think to recover any more than the sea can dry\nup. If I love you and you love me, never shall you be called\nTristram, and never shall I be Iseult, for then the love would\nnot be honourable. But I make you a vow that never shall you have\nother solace of me than you now have, if you cannot bethink\nyourself how I may be stolen from your uncle and from his bed, so\nthat he may never find me again, or be able to blame either you\nor me or have anything he may lay hold of herein. To-night must\nyou bend your attention to the matter and to-morrow you will be\nable to tell me the best device that you will have thought of,\nand I also will ponder on the matter. To-morrow, when I shall\nhave risen, come early to speak to me, and each will say his\nthought, and we will carry out that which we shall consider\nbest.\"\n\nWhen Cliges heard her wish, he has granted her all, and says that\nit shall be right well done. He leaves her blithe, and blithe he\ngoes away, and each lies awake in bed all night and they think\nwith great delight over what seems best to them. The morrow they\ncome again together, as soon as they were risen, and they took\ncounsel in private, as there was need for them to do. First\nCliges says and recounts what he had thought of in the night.\n\"Lady,\" quoth he, \"I think and believe that we could not do\nbetter than go away to Britain: thither have I devised to take\nyou away. Now take heed that the matter fall not through on your\nside. For never was Helen received at Troy with such great joy,\nwhen Paris had brought her thither, that there will not be yet\ngreater joy felt throughout the whole land of the king, my uncle,\nanent you and me. And if this please you not well, tell me your\nthought; for I am ready, whatever come of it, to cleave to your\nthought.\" She replies: \"And I shall speak it. Never will I go\nwith you thus, for then, when we had gone away, we should be\nspoken of throughout the world as the blonde Iseult and Tristram\nare spoken of; but here and there all women and men would blame\nour happiness. No one would believe or could be expected to\nbelieve the actual truth of the matter. Who would believe then as\nregards your uncle that I have gone off and escaped from him\nstill a maid, but a maid to no purpose? Folk would hold me a\nlight-of-love and a wanton, and you a madman. But it is meet to\nkeep and observe the command of St. Paul, for St. Paul teaches\nhim who does not wish to remain continent to act so wisely that\nhe may never incur outcry nor blame nor reproach. It is well to\nstop an evil mouth, and this I think I can fully accomplish, if\nit be not too grievous for you; for if I act as my thought\nsuggests to me, I will pretend to be dead. I will shortly feign\nsickness, and do you on your side lavish your pains to provide\nfor my tomb. Set your attention and care on this, that both tomb\nand bier be made in such fashion that I die not there nor\nsuffocate, and let no one perceive you that night when you will\nbe ready to take me away. And you will find me a refuge, such\nthat never any save you may see me; and let no one provide me\nwith anything of which I have need or requirement, save you to\nwhom I grant and give myself. Never in all my life do I seek to\nbe served by any other man. You will be my lord and my servant,\ngood will be to me whatsoever you will do to me, nor shall I ever\nbe lady of the empire, if you be not lord of it. A poor, dark,\nand sordid place will be to me more splendid than all these\nhalls, when you shall be together with me. If I have you and see\nyou, I shall be lady of all the wealth in the world, and the\nwhole world will be mine. And if the thing is done wisely, never\nwill it be interpreted ill, and none will ever be able to point\nthe finger of scorn at me, for through the whole empire folk will\nbelieve that I have rotted in the grave. And Thessala, my nurse,\nwho has brought me up and in whom I have great trust, will aid me\nin good faith, for she is very wise and I have great confidence\nin her.\" And Cliges, when he heard his love, replies: \"Lady, if\nso it can be, and if you think that your nurse is likely to\ncounsel you rightly in the matter, all you have to do is to make\npreparations and to carry them out speedily; but if we act not\nwisely, we are lost beyond recovery. In this town there is a\ncraftsman who carves and works in wood wondrous well; there is no\nland where he is not famed for the works of art that he has made\nand carved and shaped. John is his name, and he is my serf. No\nhandicraft is there, however peculiar it be, in which anyone\ncould rival him, if John set his mind to it with a will. For\ncompared with him they are all novices like a child at nurse. It\nis by imitating his works that the inhabitants of Antioch and of\nRome have learned to do whatever they can accomplish, and no more\nloyal man is known. But now will I put him to the test, and if I\ncan find loyalty in him, I will free him and all his heirs, and I\nwill not fail to tell him our plan, if he swears and vows to me\nthat he will aid me loyally therein and will never betray me in\nthis matter.\" She replies: \"Now be it so.\"\n\nBy her leave Cliges came forth from the chamber and departed. And\nshe sends for Thessala, her nurse, whom she had brought from the\nland where she was born. And Thessila came forthwith, for she\nneither lingers nor delays: but she knows not why her mistress\nsends for her. Fenice asks her in private conference what she\ncounsels and what seems good to her. She neither hides nor\nconceals from Thessala even the smallest part of her thought.\n\"Nurse,\" says she, \"I know well that never a thing that I tell\nyou will afterwards become known through you, for I have proved\nyou right well and have found you very wise. You have done so\nmuch for me that I love you. Of all my evils I complain to you,\nnor do I take counsel elsewhere. You know well why I lie awake\nand what I think and what I wish. My eyes can see nothing to\nplease me, save one thing, but I shall have from it neither\nenjoyment nor comfort, if I do not pay very dearly for it\nbeforehand. And yet I have found my mate; for if I desire him,\nhe, on his side, desires me too; if I grieve, he, on his side,\ngrieves with my sorrow and my anguish. Now I must confess to you\na thought and a parley, in which we two in solitude have resolved\nand agreed.\" Then she has told and related to her that she\nintends to feign herself ill, and says that she will complain so\nmuch that finally she will appear dead, and Cliges will steal her\naway in the night, and they will be always henceforth together.\nIn no other way, it seems to her, could she continue firm in her\nresolve. But if she were assured that Thessala would help her in\nit, the thing could be done according to her wish; \"But too long\ndo joy and good fortune for me delay and tarry.\" Forthwith her\nnurse assures her that she will lend all her aid to the\nenterprise, let her now have neither fear nor dread in regard to\naught; and she says she will take so much pains about the matter,\nas soon as she shall undertake it, that never will there be any\nman who sees her who will not believe quite surely that her soul\nis severed from the body, when Thessala shall have given her a\ndrink that will make her cold and wan and pale and stiff, without\nspeech and without breath; and yet she will be quite alive and\nsound, and will feel neither good nor ill, nor will she suffer\nany harm during a day and a whole night in the tomb and in the\nbier.\n\nWhen Fenice had heard it, thus has she spoken and replied:\n\"Nurse, I put myself in your care, I give you free leave to do\nwhat you will with me. I am at your disposal; think for me, and\nbid the folk here that there be none who does not go away. I am\nill and they disturb me.\" The nurse tells them courteously: \"My\nlords, my lady is unwell and wishes you all to go away, for you\nspeak too much and make too much noise, and noise is bad for her.\nShe will have neither rest nor case as long as you are in this\nroom. Never heretofore that I remember had she illness of which I\nheard her complain so much, so very great and grievous is her\nsickness. Depart, and it vex you not.\" They speedily go, one and\nall, as soon as Thessala had commanded it. And Cliges has quickly\nsent for John to his lodging, and has said to him privily: \"John,\nknowest thou what I will say? Thou art my serf, I am thy lord,\nand I Can give thee or sell thee and take thy body and thy goods\nas a thing that is my own. But if I could trust thee concerning\nan affair of mine that I am thinking of, thou wouldst for\nevermore be free, and likewise the heirs which shall be born of\nthee.\" John, who much desires freedom, forthwith replies: \"Sir,\"\nsays he, \"there is no thing that I would not do wholly at your\nwill, provided that thereby I might see myself free and my wife\nand children free. Tell me your will; never will there be\nanything so grievous that it will be toil or punishment to me,\nnor will it be any burden to me. And were it not so, yet it will\nbehove me to do it even against my will, and set aside all my own\nbusiness.\" \"True, John, but it is such a thing that my mouth dare\nnot speak it, unless thou warrant me and swear to me, and unless\nthou altogether assure me that thou wilt faithfully aid me and\nwill never betray me.\" \"Willingly, Sir,\" quoth John, \"never be\ndoubtful of that. For this I swear you and warrant you that as\nlong as I shall be a living man I will never say aught that I\nthink will grieve or vex you.\" \"Ah, John! not even on pain of\ndeath is there a man to whom I should dare to say that concerning\nwhich I wish to seek counsel of thee; rather would I let my eyes\nbe plucked out. Rather would I that thou shouldst kill me than\nthat thou shouldst say it to any other man. But I find thee so\nloyal and prudent, that I will tell thee what is in my heart.\nThou wilt accomplish my pleasure well, as I think, as regards\nboth thy aid and thy silence.\" \"Truly, Sir! so aid me God!\"\nForthwith Cliges relates to him and tells him the enterprise\nquite openly. And when he has disclosed to him the truth, as ye\nknow it who have heard me tell it, then John says that he\npromises him to make the tomb well and put therein his best\nendeavour, and says that he will take him to see a house of his\nown building, and he will show him this that he has made, which\nnever any man, woman, or child yet saw, if it pleases him to go\nwith him there where he is working and painting and carving all\nby himself without any other folk. He will show him the fairest\nand most beautiful place that he ever saw. Cliges replies: \"Let\nus then go.\"\n\nBelow the town in a sequestered spot had John built a tower, and\nhe had toiled with great wisdom. Thither has he led Cliges with\nhim, and leads him over the rooms, which were adorned with images\nfair and finely painted. He shows him the rooms and the\nfireplaces, and leads him up and down. Cliges sees the house to\nbe lonely, for no one stays or dwells there. He passes from one\nroom to another till he thinks to have seen all, and the tower\nhas pleased him well, and he said that it was very beautiful. The\nlady will be safe there all the days that she will live; for no\nman will ever know her to be there. \"No, truly, lord, she will\nnever be known to be here. But think you to have seen all my\ntower and all my pleasaunce? Still are there lurking-places such\nas no man would be able to find. And if it is allowed you to try\nyour skill in searching as well as you can, never will you be\nable to ransack so thoroughly as to find more rooms here, however\nsubtle and wise you are, if I do not show and point them out to\nyou. Know that here baths are not lacking, nor anything that I\nremember and think of as suitable for a lady. She will be well at\nher ease here. This tower has a wider base underground, as you\nshall see, and never will you be able to find anywhere door or\nentrance. With such craft and such art is the door made of hard\nstone that never will you find the join thereof.\" \"Now hear I\nmarvel,\" quoth Cliges; \"go forward; I shall follow, for I long to\nsee all this.\" Then has John started off, and leads Cliges by the\nhand to a smooth and polished door, which is all painted and\ncoloured. At the wall has John stopped, and he held Cliges by the\nright hand. \"Lord,\" quoth he, \"no man is there who could have\nseen door or window in this wall, and think you that one could\npass it in any wise without doing it injury and harm?\" Cliges\nanswers that he does not think he could, nor ever will think it,\nunless he sees it with his own eyes. Then says John that his lord\nshall see it, for he will open for him the door of the wall.\nJohn, who himself had wrought the work, unlocks and opens to him\nthe door of the wall, so that he neither hurts it nor injures it,\nand the one passes before the other, and they descend by a spiral\nstaircase to a vaulted room where John wrought at his craft, when\nit was his pleasure to construct aught. \"Lord,\" quoth he, \"here\nwhere we are was never one of all the men whom God created save\nus two; and the place has all that makes for comfort, as you will\nsee in a trice. I advise that your retreat be here, and that your\nlady-love be hidden in it. Such a lodging is meet for such a\nguest, for there are rooms and baths and in the baths hot water,\nwhich comes through a pipe below the earth. That man who would\nseek a convenient spot to place and hide his lady would have to\ngo far before he found one so delightful. You will deem it a very\nfitting refuge when you have been all over it.\" Then has John\nshown him all, fair chambers and painted vaults, and he has shown\nhim much of his workmanship, which pleased him mightily. When\nthey had seen the whole tower, then said Cliges: \"John, my\nfriend, I free you and your heirs one and all, and I am wholly\nyours. I desire that my lady be here all alone, and that no one\never know it save me and you and her, and not another soul.\" John\nreplies: \"I thank you. Now we have been here long enough, now we\nhave no more to do, so let us start on the return journey.\" \"You\nhave said well,\" Cliges replies, \"let us depart.\" Then they turn\nand have issued forth from the tower. On their return they hear\nin the town how one tells another in confidence: \"You know not\nthe grave news about my lady the empress. May the Holy Spirit\ngive health to the wise and noble lady, for she lies in very\ngreat sickness.\"\n\nWhen Cliges hears the report, he went to the court at full speed;\nbut neither joy nor pleasure was there; for all were sad and\ndejected on account of the empress, who feigns herself ill;\nfeigns--for the evil whereof she complains gives her no pain or\nhurt; she has said to all that as long as the malady whereby her\nheart and head feel pain holds her so strongly, she will have no\nman save the emperor or his nephew enter her chamber; for she\nwill not deny herself to them; though if the emperor, her lord,\ncome not, little will it irk her. She must needs risk great\nsuffering and great peril for Cliges' sake, but it weighs on her\nheart that he comes not; she desires to see naught save him.\nCliges will soon be in her presence and stay there till he shall\nhave related to her what he has seen and found. He comes before\nher and has told her; but he remained there a short time only,\nfor Fenice, in order that people may think that what pleases her\nannoys her, has said aloud: \"Away! Away! You tire me greatly, you\nweary me much; for I am so oppressed with sickness that never\nshall I be raised from it and restored to health.\" Cliges, whom\nthis greatly pleases, goes away, making a doleful\ncountenance--for never before did you see it so doleful.\nOutwardly he appears full sad; but his heart is blithe within,\nfor it looks to have its joy.\n\nThe empress, without having any illness, complains and feigns\nherself ill; and the emperor, who believes her, ceases not to\nmake lamentation, and sends to seek leeches for her; but she will\nnot let that one see her, nor does she let herself be touched.\nThis grieves the emperor, for she says that never will she have\nleech except one, who will know how to give her health quickly,\nwhen it shall be his will. He will make her die or live; into his\nkeeping she puts herself for health and for life. They think that\nshe is speaking of God, but a very different meaning has she, for\nshe means none other than Cliges. He is her God, who can give her\nhealth and who can make her die.\n\nThus the empress provides that no leech attend her, and she will\nnot eat or drink, in order the better to deceive the emperor,\nuntil she is both pale and wan all over. And her nurse stays near\nher, who with very wondrous craft sought secretly through all the\ntown, so that no one knew it, until she found a woman sick of a\nmortal sickness without cure. In order the better to carry out\nthe deception, she went often to visit her and promised her that\nshe would cure her of her ill, and each day she would bring a\nglass to see her water, till she saw that medicine would no\nlonger be able to aid her and that she would die that very day.\nShe has brought this water and has kept it straitly until the\nemperor rose. Now she goes before him and says to him: \"If you\nwill, sire, send for all your leeches, for my lady, who is\nsuffering from a sore sickness, has passed water and wishes that\nthe leeches see it, but that they come not in her presence.\" The\nleeches came into the hall; they see the water very bad and pale,\nand each says what seems to him the truth, till they all agree\ntogether that never will she recover, and will not even see the\nhour of None, and if she lives so long, then at the latest God\nwill take her soul to himself. This have they murmured secretly.\nThen the emperor has bidden and conjured them that they tell the\ntruth of the matter. They reply that they have no hope at all of\nher recovery, and that she cannot pass the hour of None, for\nbefore that hour she will have given up the ghost. When the\nemperor has heard the word, scarcely can he refrain from swooning\nto the ground, and likewise many a one of the others who heard\nit. Never did any folk make such mourning as then prevailed\nthrough all the palace. I spare you the account of the mourning,\nand you shall hear what Thessala is about, who mixes and brews\nthe draught. She has mixed and stirred it, for long beforehand\nshe had provided herself with all that she knew was needed for\nthe draught. A little before the hour of None she gives her the\ndraught to drink. As soon as she had drunk it, her sight grew\ndim, and her face was as pale and white as if she had lost her\nblood, nor would she have moved hand or foot even if one had\nflayed her alive; she neither stirs nor says a word, and yet she\nhearkens to and hears the mourning which the emperor makes, and\nthe wailing with which the hall is full. And o'er all the city\nthe folk wail who weep and say: \"God! what a sorrow and a\ncalamity has accursed death dealt us! Greedy death! Covetous\ndeath! Death is worse than any she-wolf, for death cannot be\nsated. Never couldst thou give a worse wound to the world. Death,\nwhat hast thou done? May God confound thee who hast extinguished\nall beauty. Thou hast slain the choicest creature and the fairest\npicture--if she had but remained alive!--that God ever laboured\nto fashion. Too patient is God, since He suffers thee to have the\npower to ruin His handiwork. Now should God be wroth with thee\nand cast thee forth from thy dominion, for thou hast committed\ntoo wanton and great arrogance and great insult.\" Thus all the\npeople storm, they wring their hands and beat their palms, and\nthe clerks read there their psalms, who pray for the good lady\nthat God may show mercy to her soul.\n\nAmid the tears and the wails, as the writings tell us, have come\nthree aged physicians from Salerno, where they had been a long\ntime. They have stopped on account of the great mourning, and ask\nand inquire the reason of the wails and tears, why folk are thus\ndemented and distressed. And they tell them and reply: \"God!\nLords, know ye not? At this ought the whole world, each place in\nturn, to become frenzied together with us, if it knew the great\nmourning and grief and hurt and the great loss which this day has\nopened to our ken. God! whence then are you come, since you know\nnot what has happened but now in the city? We will tell you the\ntruth, for we wish to join you with us in the mourning wherewith\nwe mourn. Know you nought of ravenous death, who desires all and\ncovets all and in all places lies in wait for the best, and how\ngreat an act of folly he hath to-day committed, as he is wont?\nGod had lit the world with a brilliance, with a light. But Death\ncannot choose but do what he is wont to do. Ever with his might\nhe blots out the best that he can find. Now doth he will to prove\nhis power, and has taken in one body more worth than he has left\nin the world. If he had taken the whole world, he could not have\ndone one whit worse, provided that he left alive and sound that\nprey whom he now leads away. Beauty, courtesy, and knowledge, and\nwhatsoever appertaining to goodness a lady can have, has Death,\nwho has destroyed all good in the person of my lady the empress,\nsnatched from us and cheated us of. Thus hath Death slain us.\"\n\"Ah, God!\" say the leeches, \"thou hatest this city, we know it\nwell, for that we came not here a little space ago. If we had\ncome yesterday, Death might have esteemed himself highly, if he\nhad taken aught from us by force.\" \"Lords, my lady would not for\naught have allowed that you should have seen her or troubled\nyourself about her. There were enough and to spare of good\nleeches, but never did my lady please that one or other of them\nshould see her who could meddle with her illness.\" \"No?\" \"By my\nfaith, that did she truly not.\" Then they remembered Solomon, and\nthat his wife hated him so much that she betrayed him under a\npretence of death. Perhaps this lady has done the same thing; but\nif they could by any means succeed in touching her, there is no\nman born for whose sake they would have lied or would refrain\nfrom speaking the whole truth about it, if they can see deceit\nthere. Towards the court they go forthwith, where one would not\nhave heard God thundering, such noise and wailing there was. The\nmaster of them, who knew the most, has approached the bier. None\nsays to him: \"You touch it at your peril.\" Nor does any one pull\nhim back from it. And he puts his hand on her breast and on her\nside and feels beyond a doubt that she has her life whole in her\nbody; well he knows it and well he perceives it. He sees before\nhim the emperor, who is frenzied and ready to kill himself with\ngrief. He cries aloud and says to him: \"Emperor, comfort thyself.\nI know and see for a certainty that this lady is not dead. Leave\nthy mourning and console thyself. If I give her not back to thee\nalive, either slay me or hang me.\" Now all the wailing throughout\nthe palace is calmed and hushed, and the emperor tells the leech\nthat now it is permitted him to give orders and to speak his will\nquite freely. If he brings back the empress to life, he will be\nlord and commander over him; but he will be hanged as a robber,\nif he has lied to him in aught. And he says to him: \"I accept the\ncondition; never have mercy on me, if I do not make the lady here\nspeak to you. Without hesitation or delay have the palace cleared\nfor me. Let not one or another stay here. I must see privately\nthe evil from which the lady suffers. These two leeches alone,\nwho are of my company, shall stay here with me, and let all the\nothers go without.\" This thing Cliges, John, and Thessala would\nhave gainsaid: but all those who were there would have\ninterpreted it to their harm, if they had attempted to prevent\nit. Therefore they keep silence and give the counsel that they\nhear the others give, and have gone forth from the palace. And\nthe three leeches have by force ripped up the lady's\nwinding-sheet, for there was neither knife nor scissors: then\nthey say: \"Lady, have no fear, be not dismayed, but speak in all\nsafety. We know for a surety that you are quite sound and well.\nNow be wise and amenable, and despair of nought; for if you seek\nadvice from us, we will assure you all three of us, that we will\nhelp you with all our power, where it be concerning good or\nconcerning evil. We will be right loyal towards you, both in\nkeeping your secret and in aiding you. Do not compel us to reason\nlong with you. From the moment that we place our power and\nservices at your disposal, you ought not to refuse us\ncompliance.\" Thus they think to befool and to cheat her, but it\navails nought; for she cares and recks nought of their service,\nso that when the physicians see that they will avail nothing with\nregard to her by cajolery or by entreaty, then they take her off\nthe bier and strike her and beat her; but their fury is to no\npurpose, since for all this they draw not a word from her. Then\nthey threaten and frighten her and say that, if she does not\nspeak, she will that very day find out the folly of her action;\nfor they will inflict on her such dire treatment that never\nbefore was its like inflicted on any body of caitiff woman. \"Well\nwe know that you are alive and do not deign to speak to us. Well\nwe know that you are feigning and would have deceived the\nemperor. Have no fear of us at all. But if any man has angered\nyou, disclose your folly, before we have further wounded you, for\nyou are acting very basely; and we will aid you, alike in wisdom\nor in folly.\" It cannot be, it avails them nought. Then once more\nthey deal her blows on the back with their straps, and the\nstripes that run downwards become visible, and so much do they\nbeat her tender flesh that they make the blood gush out from it.\nWhen they have beaten her with straps till they have lacerated\nher flesh, and till the blood which issues through her wounds\nruns down from them, and when for all that they can do nothing\nnor extort sigh or word promise her; they are meddling to no\npurpose. And from her, and she never moves nor stirs, then they\ntell her that they must seek fire and lead, and that they will\nmelt it and will pour it into her palms rather than fail to make\nher speak. They seek and search for fire and lead; they kindle\nthe fire; they melt the lead. Thus the base villains maltreat and\ntorture the lady, for they have poured into her palms the lead,\nall boiling and hot just as they have taken it from the fire. Nor\nyet is it enough for them that the lead has passed through and\nthrough the palms, but the reprobate villains say that, if she\nspeak not soon, straightway they will roast her till she is all\ngrilled. She is silent and forbids them not to beat or ill-treat\nher flesh. And even now they were about to put her to the fire to\nroast and grill, when more than a thousand of the ladies, who\nwere in front of the palace, come to the door and see through a\ntiny chink the torture and the unhappy fate that they were\npreparing for the lady, for they were making her suffer martyrdom\nfrom the coal and from the flame. To break in the door and\nshatter it they bring hatchets and hammers. Great was the din and\nthe attack to break and smash the door. If now they can lay hold\non the leeches, without delay all their desert shall be rendered\nthem. The ladies enter the palace all together with one bound,\nand Thessala is among the press, whose one anxiety is to get to\nher lady. She finds her all naked at the fire, much injured and\nmuch mishandled. She has laid her back on the bier and covered\nher beneath the pall. And the ladies proceed to tender and pay to\nthe three leeches their deserts; they would not send for or await\nemperor or seneschal. They have hurled them down through the\nwindows full into the court, so that they have broken the necks\nand ribs and arms and legs of all three; better never wrought any\nladies. Now the three leeches have received from the ladies right\nsorry payment for their deeds; but Cliges is much dismayed and\nhas great grief, when he hears tell of the great agony and the\ntorture that his lady has suffered for him. Almost does he lose\nhis reason; for he fears greatly and indeed with justice--that\nshe may be killed or maimed by the torture caused her by the\nthree leeches, who have died in consequence; and he is despairing\nand disconsolate. And Thessala comes bringing a very precious\nsalve with which she has anointed full gently the lady's body and\nwounds. The ladies have enshrouded her again in a white Syrian\npall, wherein they had shrouded her before, but they leave her\nface uncovered. Never that night do they abate their wailing or\ncease or make an end thereof. Through all the town they wail like\nfolk demented-high and low, and poor and rich-and it seems that\neach sets his will on outdoing all the others in making\nlamentation, and on never abandoning it of his own will. All\nnight is the mourning very great. On the morrow John came to\ncourt, and the emperor sends for him and bids him, requests and\ncommands him: \"John! if ever thou madest a good work, now set all\nthy wisdom and thy invention to making a tomb, such that one\ncannot find one so fair and well decorated.\" And John, who had\nalready done it, says that he has prepared a very fair and\nwell-carved one; but never, when he began to make it, had he\nintention that any body should be laid there save a holy one.\n\"Now, let the empress be enclosed within in lieu of relics; for\nshe is, I ween, a very holy thing.\" \"Well said,\" quoth the\nemperor, \"in the minster of my lord Saint Peter shall she be\nburied, there outside where one buries other bodies; for before\nshe died, she begged and prayed me with all her heart that I\nwould have her laid there. Now go and busy yourself about it, and\nset your tomb, as is right and meet, in the fairest place in the\ncemetery.\" John replies: \"Gladly, sire.\" Forthwith John departs,\nprepares well the tomb, and did thereat what a master of his\ncraft would do. Because the stone was hard, and even more on\naccount of the cold, he has placed therein a feather bed; and\nmoreover, that it may smell sweet to her, he has strewn thereon\nboth flowers and foliage. But he did it even more for this, that\nnone should spy the mattress that he had placed in the grave. Now\nhad the whole office been said in chapels and in parish churches,\nand they were continually tolling as it is meet to toll for the\ndead. They bid the body be brought, and it will be placed in the\ntomb, whereat John has worked to such effect that he has made it\nvery magnificent and splendid. In all Constantinople has been\nleft neither great nor small who does not follow the corpse\nweeping, and they curse and revile Death; knights and squires\nswoon, and the dames and the maidens beat their breasts and have\nrailed against Death. \"Death!\" quoth each, \"why took'st thou not\na ransom for my lady? Forsooth, but a small booty hast thou\ngained, and for us the loss is great.\" And Cliges, of a truth,\nmourns so much that he wounds and maltreats himself more than all\nthe others do, and it is a marvel that he does not kill himself;\nbut still he postpones suicide till the hour and the time come\nfor him to disinter her and hold her in his arms, and know\nwhether she is alive or not. About the grave are the lords, who\nlay the body there; but they do not meddle with John in the\nsetting up of the tomb, and indeed they could see nought of it,\nbut have all fallen swooning to the earth, and John has had good\nleisure to do all he listed. He so set up the tomb that there was\nno other creature in it; well does he seal and join and close it.\nThen might that man well have boasted himself who, without harm\nor injury, would have been able to take away or disjoin aught\nthat John had put there.\n\nFenice is in the tomb, until it came to dark night; but thirty\nknights guard her, and there are ten tapers burning, and they\nmade a great light. The knights were sated and weary with\nmourning, and have eaten and drunk in the night till they all lay\nasleep together. At night Cliges steals forth from the court and\nfrom all the folk. There was not knight or servant who ever knew\nwhat had become of him. He did not rest till he came to John, who\ngives him all the counsel that he can. He puts on him a suit of\narmour, which he will never need. Both all armed go forth to the\ncemetery at post haste; but the cemetery was enclosed all around\nby a high wall; and the knights, who were sleeping, and had\nclosed the door within that none might enter, thought they were\nsafe. Cliges sees not how he may pass, for he cannot enter by the\ndoor, and yet by hook or by crook he must enter, for love exhorts\nand admonishes him. He grips the wall and mounts up, for right\nstrong and agile was he. Within was an orchard and there were\ntrees in plenty. Near the wall one had been planted so that it\ntouched the wall. Now has Cliges what he wished for; he let\nhimself down by this tree. The first thing that he did was to go\nand open the door to John. They see the knights sleeping and they\nhave extinguished all the tapers, so that no light remains there.\nAnd now John uncovers the grave and opens the tomb, so that he\ninjures it not at all. Cliges leaps into the grave and has\ncarried forth his lady, who is very weak and lifeless, and he\nfalls on her neck and kisses and embraces her. He knows not\nwhether to rejoice or mourn; for she moves not nor stirs. And\nJohn has closed again the tomb with all the speed he may, so that\nit does not in any wise appear that it had been touched. They\nhave approached the tower as quickly as ever they could. When\nthey had put her within the tower in the rooms that were\nunderground, then they took off the grave-clothes, and Cliges,\nwho knew nothing of the draught that she had within her body,\nwhich makes her dumb and prevents her stirring, thinks in\nconsequence that she is dead, and he loses hope and comfort\nthereat, and sighs deeply and weeps. But soon the hour will have\ncome that the draught will lose its force. And Fenice, who hears\nhim lament, tries and strains that she may be able to comfort him\neither by word or by look. Her heart nearly breaks because of the\nmourning she hears him make. \"Ha! Death,\" quoth he, \"how base\nthou art, in that thou sparest and passest by worthless and\noutcast creatures! Such thou dost allow to last and live. Death!\nart thou mad or drunk that thou has killed my love without\nkilling me? This that I see is a marvel: my love is dead and I am\nalive. Ah, sweet love! why does your lover live and see you dead?\nNow might one rightly say that you are dead for my sake, and that\nI have killed and slain you. Loved lady! then am I the Death who\nhas killed you; is not that unjust? For I have taken away my life\nin you and yet have kept yours in me. For were not your health\nand your life mine, sweet friend? And were not mine yours? For I\nloved nought but you: we twain were one being. Now have I done\nwhat I ought, for I keep your soul in my body, and mine is gone\nforth of yours; and yet the one was bound to bear the other\ncompany, wherever it was, and nothing ought to have parted them.\"\nAt this she heaves a sigh and says in a weak, low voice: \"Friend!\nfriend! I am not wholly dead, but well-nigh so. But I hope nought\nabout my life. I thought to have a jest and to feign: but now\nmust I needs complain, for Death loves not my jest. A marvel\n'twill be if I escape alive, for much have the leeches wounded\nme, broken and lacerated my flesh; and nevertheless, if it could\nbe that my nurse were here with me, she would make me quite\nwhole, if care could avail aught herein.\" \"Friend! then let it\nnot distress you,\" quoth Cliges, \"for this very night I will\nbring her here for you.....Friend! rather will John go.\" John\ngoes thither and has sought till he found her, and he imparts to\nher how greatly he desires her to come; never let any excuse\ndetain her; for Fenice and Cliges summon her to a tower where\nthey await her; for Fenice is sore mishandled, and she must come\nprovided with salves and electuaries, and let her know that the\nlady will live no longer if she succour her not speedily.\nThessala forthwith runs and takes ointment and plaster and an\nelectuary that she had made, and has joined company with John.\nThen they issue from the town secretly and go till they come\nstraight to the tower. When Fenice sees her nurse, she thinks she\nis quite cured, so much she loves her and believes in her and\ntrusts her. And Cliges embraces and greets her and says:\n\"Welcome, nurse! for I love and esteem you greatly. Nurse, in\nGod's name what think you of this damsel's illness? What is your\nopinion? Will she recover?\" \"Ay, sir! fear not that I cannot cure\nher right well. A fortnight will not have passed before I make\nher whole, so that never at any time was she more whole and gay.\"\n\nThessala sets her mind on curing the lady, and John goes to\nprovide the tower with whatsoever store is meet. Cliges comes and\ngoes to the tower boldly, in view of all, for he has left there a\ngoshawk moulting, and says that he comes to see it, and none can\nguess that he goes there for any other reason save only on\naccount of the hawk. Much does he tarry there both night and day.\nHe makes John guard the tower, that no one may enter there\nagainst his will. Fenice has no hurt whereof she need grieve, for\nwell has Thessala cured her. If now Cliges had been duke of\nAlmeria or of Morocco or of Tudela, he would not have prized such\nhonour a berry in comparison of the joy he has. Certes, Love\nabased himself no whit when he put them together; for it seems to\nboth when one embraces and kisses the other that the whole world\nis made better for their joy and their pleasure. Ask me no more\nabout it; I will but say that there is nought that one wills that\nthe other does not welcome. So is their will at one as if they\ntwain were but one. All this year and some space of the next, two\nmonths and more, I ween, has Fenice been in the tower, until the\nspring of the year. When flowers and foliage bud forth, and the\nlittle birds are making merry--for they delight in their\nbird-language--it happened that Fenice heard one morning the\nnightingale sing. Cliges was holding her gently with one arm\nabout her waist and the other about her neck, and she him in like\nmanner, and she has said to him: \"Fair, dear friend, much joy\nwould an orchard afford me, where I could take my pleasure. I\nhave seen neither moon nor sun shine for more than fifteen whole\nmonths. If it might be, full gladly would I sally forth into the\ndaylight, for I am pent up in this tower. If near by there were\nan orchard where I could go to disport myself, great good would\nthis do me often.\" Then Cliges promises that he will seek counsel\nof John as soon as he shall see him. And now it has happened that\nlo! John has come thither, for he was often wont to come. Cliges\nhas spoken with him of Fenice's desire. \"All is prepared and\nalready at hand,\" quoth John, \"whatsoever she orders. This tower\nis well provided with all that she wishes and asks for.\" Then is\nFenice right blithe and bids John lead her thither, and John\nmakes no demur. Then goes John to open a door, such that I have\nneither skill nor power to tell or describe the fashion of it.\nNone save John could have had the skill to make it, nor could any\none ever have told that there was door or window there, as long\nas the door was not opened, so hidden and concealed was it.\n\nWhen Fenice saw the door open and the sun which she had not seen\nfor a long time shine in, she has all her blood awhirl with joy\nand says that now she seeks nothing more, inasmuch as she can\ncome forth out of the hiding-place, and seeks no refuge\nelsewhere. By the door she has entered the orchard, and this\ngreatly pleases and delights her. In the midst of the orchard\nthere was a grafted tree loaded with flowers and very leafy, and\nit formed a canopy above. The branches were so trained that they\nhung towards the ground and bent almost to the earth, all save\nthe top from which they sprang, for that rose straight upwards.\nFenice desires no other place. And below the grafted tree the\nmeadow is very delectable and very fair, nor ever will the sun be\nso high even at noon, when it is hottest, that ever a ray can\npass that way, so skilled was John to arrange things and to guide\nand train the branches. There Fenice goes to disport herself, and\nall day she makes her couch there; there they are in joy and\ndelight. And the orchard is enclosed around with a high wall\nwhich joins the tower, so that no creature could enter it, unless\nhe had climbed to the top of the tower.\n\nNow is Fenice in great delight: there is nought to displease her,\nnor lacks she aught that she could wish, when 'neath the flowers\nand leaves it lists her embrace her lover. At the time when folk\ngo hunting with the sparrow-hawk and with the hound, which seeks\nthe lark and the stonechat and tracks the quail and the\npartridge, it happened that a knight of Thrace, a young and\nsprightly noble, esteemed for his prowess, had one day gone\na-hawking quite close beside this tower; Bertrand was the\nknight's name. His sparrow-hawk had soared high, for it had\nmissed the lark that was its aim. Now will Bertrand consider\nhimself ill served by fate, if he lose his sparrow-hawk. He saw\nit descend and settle below the tower in an orchard, and it\npleased him much to see this, for now he reckons that he will not\nlose it. Forthwith he goes to scale the wall, and wins to get\nover it. Under the grafted tree he saw Fenice and Cliges sleeping\ntogether side by side. \"God!\" quoth he, \"what has befallen me?\nWhat kind of miracle is it that I see? Is it not Cliges? Yea,\nfaith. Is not that the empress by his side? Nay, but she\nresembles her, for no other being ever was so like. Such a nose,\nsuch a mouth, such a brow she has as the empress, my lady, had.\nNever did nature better succeed in making two beings of the same\ncountenance. In this lady see I nought that I should not have\nseen in my lady. If she had been alive, truly I should have said\nthat it was she.\" At that moment a pear drops and falls just\nbeside Fenice's ear. She starts, awakes, sees Bertrand and cries\naloud: \"Friend, friend, we are lost! Here is Bertrand! If he\nescapes you, we have fallen into an evil trap. He will tell folk\nthat he has seen us.\" Then has Bertrand perceived that it is the\nempress beyond all doubt. Need is there for him to depart, for\nCliges had brought his sword with him into the orchard, and had\nlaid it beside the couch. He springs up and has taken his sword,\nand Bertrand flees swiftly. With all the speed he might he grips\nthe wall, and now he was all but over it, when Cliges has come\nafter, raises now his sword, and strikes him, so that beneath the\nknee he has cut off his leg as clean as a stalk of fennel.\nNevertheless, Bertrand has escaped ill-handled and crippled, and\non the other side he is received by his men, who are beside\nthemselves with grief and wrath, when they see him thus maimed;\nthey have asked and inquired who it is that had done it to him.\n\"Question me not about it,\" quoth he, \"but raise me on my horse.\nNever will this story be recounted till it is told before the\nemperor. He who has done this to me ought not forsooth to be\nwithout fear--nor is he, for he is nigh to deadly peril.\" Then\nthey have put him on his palfrey, and, mourning, they lead him\naway in great dismay through the midst of the town. After them go\nmore than twenty thousand, who follow him to the court. And all\nthe people flock there, the one after the other, and the devil\ntake the hindmost.\n\nNow has Bertrand made his plea and complaint to the emperor in\nthe hearing of all, but they consider him an idle babbler because\nhe says that he has seen the empress stark naked. All the town is\nstirred thereat; some, when they hear this news, esteem it mere\nfolly, others advise and counsel the emperor to go to the tower.\nGreat is the uproar and the tumult of the folk who set out after\nhim. But they find nothing in the tower, for Fenice and Cliges\nare on their way, and have taken Thessala with them, who comforts\nand assures them, and says that, even if perchance they see folk\ncoming after them who come to take them, they need have no fear\nfor aught, for never to do them harm or injury would they come\nwithin the distance that one could shoot with a strong crossbow\nstretched by windlass.\n\nNow the emperor is in the tower and he has John sought out and\nfetched: he bids that he be tied and bound, and says that he will\nhave him hanged or burned and the ashes scattered to the wind.\nFor the shame that the emperor has suffered, John shall pay the\npenalty (but it will be a bootless penalty!) because he has\nsecreted in his tower the nephew and the wife of the emperor.\n\"I'faith you speak the truth,\" quoth John; \"I will not lie in the\nmatter; I will stick to the truth throughout, and if I have done\nwrong in any point, right meet is it that I be taken. But on this\nscore I could well excuse myself, that a serf ought to refuse\nnought that his rightful lord commands him. And it is known full\nsurely that I am his and the tower is his.\" \"Nay, John, rather is\nit thine.\" \"Mine, sire? Truly, as his serf I am not even my own,\nnor have I anything that is mine, save in so far as he grants it\nto me. And if you would say that my lord has done you wrong, I am\nready to defend him from the charge without his bidding me so to\ndo. But the knowledge that I must die makes me bold to speak out\nfreely my will and my mind as I have fashioned and moulded it.\nNow, be that as it may be, for if I die for my lord, I shall not\ndie in dishonour. Surely without a doubt is known the oath and\npromise that you pledged to your brother, that after you, Cliges,\nwho is going away into exile, should be emperor. And if it please\nGod, he will yet be emperor. And you are to be blamed for this,\nfor you ought not to have taken wife, but all the same you took\none and wronged Cliges, and he has wronged you in nought. And if\nI am done to death by you and die for him unjustly, if he lives,\nhe will avenge my death. Now do your utmost, for if I die, you\nwill die too.\"\n\nBeads of wrath break out on the emperor's brow when he has heard\nthe words and the insult that John has uttered against him.\n\"John,\" quoth he, \"thou shalt have respite until what time thy\nlord be found, for base has he proved himself towards me, who\nheld him right dear, nor thought to defraud him. But thou shalt\nbe kept fast in prison. If thou knowest what has become of him,\ntell me straightway, I bid thee.\" \"Tell you? And how should I\ncommit so great a treason? Of a surety, I would not betray to you\nmy lord, not though you were to rend my life out of my body, if I\nknew it. And besides this, so may God be my guard, I cannot say\nany more than you in what direction they have gone. But you are\njealous without a cause. Too little do I fear your wrath not to\ntell you truly in the hearing of all how you are deceived, and\nyet I shall never be believed in this matter. By a potion that\nyou drank, you were tricked and deceived the night that you\ncelebrated your wedding. Never at any time, save when you slept\nand it happened to you in your dreams, did any joy come to you of\nher; but the night made you dream, and the dream pleased you as\nmuch as if it had happened in your waking hours that she held you\nin her arms; and no other boon came to you from her. Her heart\nclave so straitly to Cliges that for his sake she pretended to be\ndead; and he trusted me so much that he told me and placed her in\nmy house, of which he is lord by right. You ought not to lay the\nblame on me for it; I should have merited to be burnt or hanged,\nif I had betrayed my lord and refused to do his will.\"\n\nWhen the emperor heard tell of the potion which it delighted him\nto drink, and by which Thessala deceived him, then first he\nperceived that he had never had joy of his wife--well he knew\nit--unless it had happened to him in a dream, and that such joy\nwas illusory. He says that, if he take not vengeance for the\nshame and the disgrace brought on him by the traitor who has\ncarried off from him his wife, never again will he have joy in\nhis life. \"Now, quick!\" quoth he, \"to Pavia, and from there to\nGermany, let neither castle, town, nor city be left where he be\nnot sought. He who shall bring them both prisoners will be more\ncherished by me than any other man. Now, set well to work and\nsearch both up and down and near and far!\" Then they start with\ngreat zeal, and they have spent all the day in searching; but\nCliges had such friends among them that, if they found the\nlovers, they rather would lead them to a place of refuge than\nbring them back. Throughout a whole fortnight with no small pains\nthey have pursued them, but Thessala, who is guiding them, leads\nthem so safely by art and by enchantment that they have no fear\nor alarm for all the forces of the emperor. In no town or city do\nthey lie, and yet they have whatsoever they wish and desire, as\ngood as or better than they are wont to have, for Thessala seeks\nand procures and brings for them whatsoever they wish, and no one\nfollows or pursues them, for all have abandoned the quest. But\nCliges does not delay; he goes to his uncle, King Arthur. He\nsought him till he found him, and has made to him a complaint and\nan outcry against his uncle the emperor, who, in order to\ndisinherit him, had taken wife dishonourably, when he should not\nhave done so, seeing that he had pledged his word to Cliges'\nfather that never in his life would he have a wife. And the king\nsays that with a navy will he sail to Constantinople, and fill a\nthousand ships with knights and three thousand with infantry,\nsuch that nor city nor borough nor town nor castle, however\nstrong or high it be, will be able to endure their onset. And\nCliges has not forgotten to thank the king then and there for the\naid which he is granting him. The king sends to seek and to\nsummon all the high barons of his land, and has ships and boats,\ncutters and barques sought out and equipped. With shields, with\nlances, with targes, and with knightly armour he has a hundred\nships filled and laden. The king makes so great a preparation to\nwage war that never had even Cesar or Alexander the like. He has\ncaused to be summoned and mustered all England and all Flanders,\nNormandy, France, and Brittany, and all tribes, even as far as\nthe Spanish passes. Now were they about to put to sea when\nmessengers came from Greece, who stayed the expedition and kept\nback the king and his men. With the messengers who came was John,\nwho was well worthy to be believed, for he was witness and\nmessenger of nought that was not true and that he did not know\nfor certain. The messengers were high men of Greece, who were\nseeking Cliges. They sought and asked for him until they found\nhim at the court of the king, and they have said to him: \"God\nsave you, sire. On the part of all the inhabitants of your\nempire, Greece is yielded and Constantinople given to you,\nbecause of the right that you have to it. Your uncle--as yet you\nknow it not--is dead of the grief that he had because he could\nnot find you. He had such grief that he lost his senses: never\nafterwards did he either eat or drink, and he died a madman. Fair\nsire, return now hence, for all your barons send for you. Greatly\ndo they desire and ask for you, for they will to make you\nemperor.\" Many there were who were blithe at this message, but on\nthe other hand there were man who would gladly have left their\nhomes, and who would have been mightily pleased if the host had\nset out for Greece. But the expedition has fallen through\naltogether, for the king sends away his men, and the host\ndisperses and returns home. But Cliges hastens and prepares\nhimself, for his will is to return into Greece, no care has he to\ntarry longer. He has prepared himself, and has taken leave of the\nking and all his friends: he takes Fenice with him, and they\ndepart and do not rest till they are in Greece, where men receive\nhim with great joy, as they ought to do their lord, and give him\nhis lady-love to wife; they crown them both together. He has made\nhis lady-love his wife, but he calls her lady-love and dame, nor\ndoes she for that cease to be cherished as his lady-love, and she\ncherishes him every whit as much as one ought to cherish one's\nlover. And each day their love grew; never did he mistrust her\nnor chide her for aught. She was never kept in seclusion, as\nthose who came after her later have been kept (for henceforth\nthere was no emperor who was not afraid lest his wife might\ndeceive him, when he heard tell how Fenice deceived Alis, first\nby the potion that he drank and then by the other treason). For\nwhich reason the empress, whoever she be, be she of never so\nsplendid and high degree, is guarded in Constantinople; for the\nemperor trusts her not as long as he remembers Fenice.\n\n\nHere ends the work of Chretien.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Cliges: A Romance, by Chretien de Troyes\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CLIGES: A ROMANCE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2414.txt or 2414.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/1/2414/\n\nProduced by T.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
