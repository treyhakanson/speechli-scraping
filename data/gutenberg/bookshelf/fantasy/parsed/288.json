Questionless, there was many\na serviceable brick wasted in Nineveh because finicky persons must\nneeds be deleting here and there a phrase in favor of its cuneatic\nsynonym; and it is not improbable that when the outworn sun expires in\nclinkers its final ray will gild such zealots tinkering with their\n\"style.\" Some few there must be in every age and every land of whom\nlife claims nothing very insistently save that they write perfectly of\nbeautiful happenings.\n\nYet, that the work of a man of letters is almost always a congenial\nproduct of his day and environment, is a contention as lacking in\nnovelty as it is in the need of any upholding here.  Nor is the\nrationality of that axiom far to seek; for a man of genuine literary\ngenius, since he possesses a temperament whose susceptibilities are of\nwider area than those of any other, is inevitably of all people the one\nmost variously affected by his surroundings.  And it is he, in\nconsequence, who of all people most faithfully and compactly exhibits\nthe impress of his times and his times' tendencies, not merely in his\nwritings--where it conceivably might be just predetermined\naffectation--but in his personality.\n\nSuch being the assumption upon which this volume is builded, it appears\nonly equitable for the architect frankly to indicate his cornerstone.\nHereinafter you have an attempt to depict a special temperament--one in\nessence \"literary\"--as very variously molded by diverse eras and as\nresponding in proportion with its ability to the demands of a certain\nhour.\n\nIn proportion with its ability, be it repeated, since its ability is\nsingularly hampered.  For, apart from any ticklish temporal\nconsiderations, be it remembered, life is always claiming of this\ntemperament's possessor that he write perfectly of beautiful happenings.\n\nTo disregard this vital longing, and flatly to stifle the innate\nstriving toward artistic creation, is to become (as with Wycherley and\nSheridan) a man who waives, however laughingly, his sole apology for\nexistence.  The proceeding is paltry enough, in all conscience; and\nyet, upon the other side, there is much positive danger in giving to\nthe instinct a loose rein.  For in that event the familiar\ncircumstances of sedate and wholesome living cannot but seem, like\npaintings viewed too near, to lose in gusto and winsomeness.  Desire,\nperhaps a craving hunger, awakens for the impossible.  No emotion,\nwhatever be its sincerity, is endured without a side-glance toward its\ncapabilities for being written about.  The world, in short, inclines to\nappear an ill-lit mine, wherein one quarries gingerly amidst an abiding\nloneliness (as with Pope and Ufford and Sire Raimbaut)--and wherein one\nvery often is allured into unsavory alleys (as with Herrick and\nAlessandro de Medici)--in search of that raw material which loving\nlabor will transshape into comeliness.\n\nSuch, if it be allowed to shift the metaphor, are the treacherous\nby-paths of that admirably policed highway whereon the well-groomed and\nwell-bitted Pegasi of Vanderhoffen and Charteris (in his later manner)\ntrot stolidly and safely toward oblivion.  And the result of wandering\nafield is of necessity a tragedy, in that the deviator's life, if not\nas an artist's quite certainly as a human being's, must in the outcome\nbe adjudged a failure.\n\nHereinafter, then, you have an attempt to depict a special\ntemperament--one in essence \"literary\"--as very variously molded by\ndiverse eras and as responding in proportion with its ability to the\ndemands of a certain hour.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nAnd this much said, it is permissible to hope, at least, that here and\nthere some reader may be found not wholly blind to this book's goal,\nwhatever be his opinion as to this book's success in reaching it.  Yet\nmany honest souls there be among us average-novel-readers in whose eyes\nthis volume must rest content to figure as a collection of short\nstories having naught in common beyond the feature that each deals with\nthe _affaires du coeur_ of a poet.\n\nSuch must always be the book's interpretation by mental indolence.  The\nfact is incontestable; and this fact in itself may be taken as\nsufficient to establish the inexpediency of publishing _The Certain\nHour_.  For that \"people will not buy a volume of short stories\" is\nnotorious to all publishers.  To offset the axiom there are no doubt\nincongruous phenomena--ranging from the continued popularity of the\nBible to the present general esteem of Mr. Kipling, and embracing the\nrather unaccountable vogue of \"O. Henry\";--but, none the less, the\nsuperstition has its force.\n\nHere intervenes the multifariousness of man, pointed out somewhere by\nMr. Gilbert Chesterton, which enables the individual to be at once a\nvegetarian, a golfer, a vestryman, a blond, a mammal, a Democrat, and\nan immortal spirit.  As a rational person, one may debonairly consider\n_The Certain Hour_ possesses as large license to look like a volume of\nshort stories as, say, a backgammon-board has to its customary guise of\na two-volume history; but as an average-novel-reader, one must vote\notherwise.  As an average-novel-reader, one must condemn the very book\nwhich, as a seasoned scribbler, one was moved to write through long\nconsideration of the drama already suggested--that immemorial drama of\nthe desire to write perfectly of beautiful happenings, and the obscure\nmartyrdom to which this desire solicits its possessor.\n\nNow, clearly, the struggle of a special temperament with a fixed force\ndoes not forthwith begin another story when the locale of combat\nshifts.  The case is, rather, as when--with certainly an intervening\nchange of apparel--Pompey fights Caesar at both Dyrrachium and\nPharsalus, or as when General Grant successively encounters General Lee\nat the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor and Appomattox.  The\ncombatants remain unchanged, the question at issue is the same, the\ntragedy has continuity.  And even so, from the time of Sire Raimbaut to\nthat of John Charteris has a special temperament heart-hungrily\nconfronted an ageless problem: at what cost now, in this fleet hour of\nmy vigor, may one write perfectly of beautiful happenings?\n\n\nThus logic urges, with pathetic futility, inasmuch as we\naverage-novel-readers are profoundly indifferent to both logic and good\nwriting.  And always the fact remains that to the mentally indolent\nthis book may well seem a volume of disconnected short stories.  All of\nus being more or less mentally indolent, this possibility constitutes a\ndire fault.\n\nThree other damning objections will readily obtrude themselves:  _The\nCertain Hour_ deals with past epochs--beginning before the introduction\nof dinner-forks, and ending at that remote quaint period when people\nused to waltz and two-step--dead eras in which we average-novel-readers\nare not interested; _The Certain Hour_ assumes an appreciable amount of\nculture and information on its purchaser's part, which we\naverage-novel-readers either lack or, else, are unaccustomed to employ\nin connection with reading for pastime; and--in our eyes the crowning\nmisdemeanor--_The Certain Hour_ is not \"vital.\"\n\nHaving thus candidly confessed these faults committed as the writer of\nthis book, it is still possible in human multifariousness to consider\ntheir enormity, not merely in this book, but in fictional\nreading-matter at large, as viewed by an average-novel-reader--by a\nrepresentative of that potent class whose preferences dictate the\nnature and main trend of modern American literature.  And to do this,\nit may be, throws no unsalutary sidelight upon the still-existent\nproblem: at what cost, now, may one attempt to write perfectly of\nbeautiful happenings?\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIndisputably the most striking defect of this modern American\nliterature is the fact that the production of anything at all\nresembling literature is scarcely anywhere apparent.  Innumerable\nprinting-presses, instead, are turning out a vast quantity of\nreading-matter, the candidly recognized purpose of which is to kill\ntime, and which--it has been asserted, though perhaps too\nsweepingly--ought not to be vended over book-counters, but rather in\ndrugstores along with the other narcotics.\n\nIt is begging the question to protest that the class of people who a\ngeneration ago read nothing now at least read novels, and to regard\nthis as a change for the better.  By similar logic it would be more\nwholesome to breakfast off laudanum than to omit the meal entirely.\nThe nineteenth century, in fact, by making education popular, has\nproduced in America the curious spectacle of a reading-public with\nessentially nonliterary tastes.  Formerly, better books were published,\nbecause they were intended for persons who turned to reading through a\nnatural bent of mind; whereas the modern American novel of commerce is\naddressed to us average people who read, when we read at all, in\nviolation of every innate instinct.\n\nSuch grounds as yet exist for hopefulness on the part of those who\ncordially care for _belles lettres_ are to be found elsewhere than in\nthe crowded market-places of fiction, where genuine intelligence\npanders on all sides to ignorance and indolence.  The phrase may seem\nto have no very civil ring; but reflection will assure the fair-minded\nthat two indispensable requisites nowadays of a pecuniarily successful\nnovel are, really, that it make no demand upon the reader's\nimagination, and that it rigorously refrain from assuming its reader to\npossess any particular information on any subject whatever.  The author\nwho writes over the head of the public is the most dangerous enemy of\nhis publisher--and the most insidious as well, because so many\npublishers are in private life interested in literary matters, and\nwould readily permit this personal foible to influence the exercise of\ntheir vocation were it possible to do so upon the preferable side of\nbankruptcy.\n\nBut publishers, among innumerable other conditions, must weigh the fact\nthat no novel which does not deal with modern times is ever really\npopular among the serious-minded.  It is difficult to imagine a tale\nwhose action developed under the rule of the Caesars or the\nMerovingians being treated as more than a literary _hors d'oeuvre_.  We\npurchasers of \"vital\" novels know nothing about the period, beyond a\nhazy association of it with the restrictions of the schoolroom; our\nsluggish imaginations instinctively rebel against the exertion of\nforming any notion of such a period; and all the human nature that\nexists even in serious-minded persons is stirred up to resentment\nagainst the book's author for presuming to know more than a potential\npatron.  The book, in fine, simply irritates the serious-minded person;\nand she--for it is only women who willingly brave the terrors of\ndepartment-stores, where most of our new books are bought\nnowadays--quite naturally puts it aside in favor of some keen and\ndaring study of American life that is warranted to grip the reader.\nSo, modernity of scene is everywhere necessitated as an essential\nqualification for a book's discussion at the literary evenings of the\nlocal woman's club; and modernity of scene, of course, is almost always\nfatal to the permanent worth of fictitious narrative.\n\nIt may seem banal here to recall the truism that first-class art never\nreproduces its surroundings; but such banality is often justified by\nour human proneness to shuffle over the fact that many truisms are\ntrue.  And this one is pre-eminently indisputable: that what mankind\nhas generally agreed to accept as first-class art in any of the varied\nforms of fictitious narrative has never been a truthful reproduction of\nthe artist's era.  Indeed, in the higher walks of fiction art has never\nreproduced anything, but has always dealt with the facts and laws of\nlife as so much crude material which must be transmuted into\ncomeliness.  When Shakespeare pronounced his celebrated dictum about\nart's holding the mirror up to nature, he was no doubt alluding to the\ncircumstance that a mirror reverses everything which it reflects.\n\nNourishment for much wildish speculation, in fact, can be got by\nconsidering what the world's literature would be, had its authors\nrestricted themselves, as do we Americans so sedulously--and\nunavoidably--to writing of contemporaneous happenings.  In\nfiction-making no author of the first class since Homer's infancy has\never in his happier efforts concerned himself at all with the great\n\"problems\" of his particular day; and among geniuses of the second rank\nyou will find such ephemeralities adroitly utilized only when they are\ndistorted into enduring parodies of their actual selves by the broad\nhumor of a Dickens or the colossal fantasy of a Balzac.  In such cases\nas the latter two writers, however, we have an otherwise competent\nartist handicapped by a personality so marked that, whatever he may\nnominally write about, the result is, above all else, an exposure of\nthe writer's idiosyncrasies.  Then, too, the laws of any locale wherein\nMr. Pickwick achieves a competence in business, or of a society wherein\nVautrin becomes chief of police, are upon the face of it extra-mundane.\nIt suffices that, as a general rule, in fiction-making the true artist\nfinds an ample, if restricted, field wherein the proper functions of\nthe preacher, or the ventriloquist, or the photographer, or of the\npublic prosecutor, are exercised with equal lack of grace.\n\nBesides, in dealing with contemporary life a novelist is goaded into\ntoo many pusillanimous concessions to plausibility.  He no longer moves\nwith the gait of omnipotence.  It was very different in the palmy days\nwhen Dumas was free to play at ducks and drakes with history, and\nVictor Hugo to reconstruct the whole system of English government, and\nScott to compel the sun to set in the east, whenever such minor changes\ncaused to flow more smoothly the progress of the tale these giants had\nin hand.  These freedoms are not tolerated in American noveldom, and\nonly a few futile \"high-brows\" sigh in vain for Thackeray's \"happy\nharmless Fableland, where these things are.\"  The majority of us are\ndeep in \"vital\" novels.  Nor is the reason far to seek.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nOne hears a great deal nowadays concerning \"vital\" books.  Their\nauthors have been widely praised on very various grounds.  Oddly\nenough, however, the writers of these books have rarely been commended\nfor the really praiseworthy charity evinced therein toward that large\nlong-suffering class loosely describable as the average-novel-reader.\n\nYet, in connection with this fact, it is worthy of more than passing\nnote that no great while ago the _New York Times'_ carefully selected\ncommittee, in picking out the hundred best books published during a\nparticular year, declared as to novels--\"a 'best' book, in our opinion,\nis one that raises an important question, or recurs to a vital theme\nand pronounces upon it what in some sense is a last word.\"  Now this\ndefinition is not likely ever to receive more praise than it deserves.\nCavilers may, of course, complain that actually to write the last word\non any subject is a feat reserved for the Recording Angel's unique\nperformance on judgment Day.  Even setting that objection aside, it is\nundeniable that no work of fiction published of late in America\ncorresponds quite so accurately to the terms of this definition as do\nthe multiplication tables.  Yet the multiplication tables are not\nwithout their claims to applause as examples of straightforward\nnarrative.  It is, also, at least permissible to consider that therein\nthe numeral five, say, where it figures as protagonist, unfolds under\nthe stress of its varying adventures as opulent a development of real\nhuman nature as does, through similar ups-and-downs, the Reverend John\nHodder in _The Inside of the Cup_.  It is equally allowable to find the\nless simple evolution of the digit seven more sympathetic, upon the\nwhole, than those of Undine Spragg in _The Custom of the Country_.\nBut, even so, this definition of what may now, authoritatively, be\nranked as a \"best novel\" is an honest and noteworthy severance from\nmisleading literary associations such as have too long befogged our\nnotions about reading-matter.  It points with emphasis toward the\naltruistic obligations of tale-tellers to be \"vital.\"\n\nFor we average-novel-readers--we average people, in a word--are now, as\nalways, rather pathetically hungry for \"vital\" themes, such themes as\nappeal directly to our everyday observation and prejudices.  Did the\ndecision rest with us all novelists would be put under bond to confine\nthemselves forevermore to themes like these.\n\nAs touches the appeal to everyday observation, it is an old story, at\nleast coeval with Mr. Crummles' not uncelebrated pumps and tubs, if not\nwith the grapes of Zeuxis, how unfailingly in art we delight to\nrecognize the familiar.  A novel whose scene of action is explicit will\nalways interest the people of that locality, whatever the book's other\npretensions to consideration.  Given simultaneously a photograph of\nMurillo's rendering of _The Virgin Crowned Queen of Heaven_ and a\nphotograph of a governor's installation in our State capital, there is\nno one of us but will quite naturally look at the latter first, in\norder to see if in it some familiar countenance be recognizable.  And\nthus, upon a larger scale, the twentieth century is, pre-eminently,\ninterested in the twentieth century.\n\nIt is all very well to describe our average-novel-readers' dislike of\nRomanticism as \"the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a\nglass.\" It is even within the scope of human dunderheadedness again to\npoint out here that the supreme artists in literature have precisely\nthis in common, and this alone, that in their masterworks they have\navoided the \"vital\" themes of their day with such circumspection as\nlesser folk reserve for the smallpox.  The answer, of course, in either\ncase, is that the \"vital\" novel, the novel which peculiarly appeals to\nus average-novel-readers, has nothing to do with literature.  There is\nbetween these two no more intelligent connection than links the paint\nMr. Sargent puts on canvas and the paint Mr. Dockstader puts on his\nface.\n\nLiterature is made up of the re-readable books, the books which it is\npossible--for the people so constituted as to care for that sort of\nthing--to read again and yet again with pleasure.  Therefore, in\nliterature a book's subject is of astonishingly minor importance, and\nits style nearly everything: whereas in books intended to be read for\npastime, and forthwith to be consigned at random to the wastebasket or\nto the inmates of some charitable institute, the theme is of paramount\nimportance, and ought to be a serious one.  The modern novelist owes it\nto his public to select a \"vital\" theme which in itself will fix the\nreader's attention by reason of its familiarity in the reader's\neveryday life.\n\nThus, a lady with whose more candid opinions the writer of this is more\nfrequently favored nowadays than of old, formerly confessed to having\nonly one set rule when it came to investment in new\nreading-matter--always to buy the Williamsons' last book.  Her reason\nwas the perfectly sensible one that the Williamsons' plots used\ninvariably to pivot upon motor-trips, and she is an ardent\nautomobilist.  Since, as of late, the Williamsons have seen fit to\nexercise their typewriter upon other topics, they have as a matter of\ncourse lost her patronage.\n\nThis principle of selection, when you come to appraise it sanely, is\nthe sole intelligent method of dealing with reading-matter.  It seems\nhere expedient again to state the peculiar problem that we\naverage-novel-readers have of necessity set the modern\nnovelist--namely, that his books must in the main appeal to people who\nread for pastime, to people who read books only under protest and only\nwhen they have no other employment for that particular half-hour.\n\nNow, reading for pastime is immensely simplified when the book's theme\nis some familiar matter of the reader's workaday life, because at\noutset the reader is spared considerable mental effort.  The motorist\nabove referred to, and indeed any average-novel-reader, can without\nexertion conceive of the Williamsons' people in their automobiles.\nContrariwise, were these fictitious characters embarked in palankeens\nor droshkies or jinrikishas, more or less intellectual exercise would\nbe necessitated on the reader's part to form a notion of the\nconveyance.  And we average-novel-readers do not open a book with the\nintention of making a mental effort.  The author has no right to expect\nof us an act so unhabitual, we very poignantly feel.  Our prejudices he\nis freely chartered to stir up--if, lucky rogue, he can!--but he ought\nwith deliberation to recognize that it is precisely in order to avoid\nmental effort that we purchase, or borrow, his book, and afterward\ndiscuss it.\n\nHence arises our heartfelt gratitude toward such novels as deal with\n\"vital\" themes, with the questions we average-novel-readers confront or\nmake talk about in those happier hours of our existence wherein we are\nnot reduced to reading.  Thus, a tale, for example, dealing either with\n\"feminism\" or \"white slavery\" as the handiest makeshift of\nspinsterdom--or with the divorce habit and plutocratic iniquity in\ngeneral, or with the probable benefits of converting clergymen to\nChristianity, or with how much more than she knows a desirable mother\nwill tell her children--finds the book's tentative explorer, just now,\namply equipped with prejudices, whether acquired by second thought or\nsecond hand, concerning the book's topic.  As endurability goes,\nreading the book rises forthwith almost to the level of an\nafternoon-call where there is gossip about the neighbors and Germany's\nfuture.  We average-novel-readers may not, in either case, agree with\nthe opinions advanced; but at least our prejudices are aroused, and we\nare interested.\n\nAnd these \"vital\" themes awake our prejudices at the cost of a\nminimum--if not always, as when Miss Corelli guides us, with a\npositively negligible--tasking of our mental faculties.  For such\nexemption we average-novel-readers cannot  but be properly grateful.\nNay, more than this: provided the novelist contrive to rouse our\nprejudices, it matters with us not at all whether afterward they be\nsoothed or harrowed.  To implicate our prejudices somehow, to raise in\nus a partizanship in the tale's progress, is our sole request.  Whether\nthis consummation be brought about through an arraignment of some\nsocial condition which we personally either advocate or reprehend--the\nattitude weighs little--or whether this interest be purchased with\nplacidly driveling preachments of generally \"uplifting\"\ntendencies--vaguely titillating that vague intention which exists in us\nall of becoming immaculate as soon as it is perfectly convenient--the\npersonal prejudices of us average-novel-readers are not lightly lulled\nagain to sleep.\n\nIn fact, the jealousy of any human prejudice against hinted\nencroachment may safely be depended upon to spur us through an\nastonishing number of pages--for all that it has of late been\ncomplained among us, with some show of extenuation, that our original\nintent in beginning certain of the recent \"vital\" novels was to kill\ntime, rather than eternity.  And so, we average-novel-readers plod on\njealously to the end, whether we advance (to cite examples already\nsomewhat of yesterday) under the leadership of Mr. Upton Sinclair\naspersing the integrity of modern sausages and millionaires, or of Mr.\nHall Caine saying about Roman Catholics what ordinary people would\nhesitate to impute to their relatives by marriage--or whether we be\nmore suavely allured onward by Mrs. Florence Barclay, or Mr. Sydnor\nHarrison, with ingenuous indorsements of the New Testament and the\ninherent womanliness of women.\n\nThe \"vital\" theme, then, let it be repeated, has two inestimable\nadvantages which should commend it to all novelists: first, it spares\nus average-novel-readers any preliminary orientation, and thereby\nmitigates the mental exertion of reading; and secondly, it appeals to\nour prejudices, which we naturally prefer to exercise, and are\naccustomed to exercise, rather than our mental or idealistic faculties.\nThe novelist who conscientiously bears these two facts in mind is\nreasonably sure of his reward, not merely in pecuniary form, but in\nthose higher fields wherein he harvests his chosen public's honest\ngratitude and affection.\n\nFor we average-novel-readers are quite frequently reduced by\ncircumstances to self-entrustment to the resources of the novelist, as\nto those of the dentist.  Our latter-day conditions, as we cannot but\nrecognize, necessitate the employment of both artists upon occasion.\nAnd with both, we average-novel-readers, we average people, are most\ngrateful when they make the process of resorting to them as easy and\nunirritating as may be possible.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nSo much for the plea of us average-novel-readers; and our plea, we\nthink, is rational.  We are \"in the market\" for a specified article;\nand human ingenuity, co-operating with human nature, will inevitably\ninsure the manufacture of that article as long as any general demand\nfor it endures.\n\nMeanwhile, it is small cause for grief that the purchaser of American\nnovels prefers Central Park to any \"wood near Athens,\" and is more at\nhome in the Tenderloin than in Camelot.  People whose tastes happen to\nbe literary are entirely too prone to too much long-faced prattle about\nliterature, which, when all is said, is never a controlling factor in\nanybody's life.  The automobile and the telephone, the accomplishments\nof Mr. Edison and Mr. Burbank, and it would be permissible to add of\nMr. Rockefeller, influence nowadays, in one fashion or another, every\nmoment of every living American's existence; whereas had America\nproduced, instead, a second Milton or a Dante, it would at most have\ncaused a few of us to spend a few spare evenings rather differently.\n\nBesides, we know--even we average-novel-readers--that America is in\nfact producing her enduring literature day by day, although, as rarely\nfails to be the case, those who are contemporaneous with the makers of\nthis literature cannot with any certainty point them out.  To voice a\nhoary truism, time alone is the test of \"vitality.\"  In our present\nflood of books, as in any other flood, it is the froth and scum which\nshows most prominently.  And the possession of \"vitality,\" here as\nelsewhere, postulates that its possessor must ultimately perish.\n\nNay, by the time these printed pages are first read as printed pages,\nallusion to those modern authors whom these pages cite--the pre-eminent\nliterary personages of that hour wherein these pages were written--will\ninevitably have come to savor somewhat of antiquity: so that sundry\nreferences herein to the \"vital\" books now most in vogue will rouse\nmuch that vague shrugging recollection as wakens, say, at a mention of\n_Dorothy Vernon_ or _Three Weeks_ or _Beverly of Graustark_.  And while\nat first glance it might seem expedient--in revising the last\nproof-sheets of these pages--somewhat to \"freshen them up\" by\nsubstituting, for the books herein referred to, the \"vital\" and more\nwidely talked-of novels of the summer of 1916, the task would be but\nwasted labor; since even these fascinating chronicles, one comprehends\nforlornly, must needs be equally obsolete by the time these\nproof-sheets have been made into a volume.  With malice aforethought,\ntherefore, the books and authors named herein stay those which all of\nthree years back our reviewers and advertising pages, with perfect\ngravity, acclaimed as of enduring importance.  For the quaintness of\nthat opinion, nowadays, may profitably round the moral that there is\nreally nothing whereto one may fittingly compare a successful\ncontribution to \"vital\" reading-matter, as touches evanescence.\n\nAnd this is as it should be.  _Tout passe.--L'art robust seul a\nl'\u00e9ternit\u00e9_, precisely as Gautier points out, with bracing\ncommon-sense; and it is excellent thus to comprehend that to-day, as\nalways, only through exercise of the auctorial virtues of distinction\nand clarity, of beauty and symmetry, of tenderness and truth and\nurbanity, may a man in reason attempt to insure his books against\noblivion's voracity.\n\nYet the desire to write perfectly of beautiful happenings is, as the\nsaying runs, old as the hills--and as immortal.  Questionless, there\nwas many a serviceable brick wasted in Nineveh because finicky persons\nmust needs be deleting here and there a phrase in favor of its cuneatic\nsynonym; and it is not improbable that when the outworn sun expires in\nclinkers its final ray will gild such zealots tinkering with their\n\"style.\"  This, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter.  Some few\nthere must be in every age and every land of whom life claims nothing\nvery insistently save that they write perfectly of beautiful\nhappenings.  And even we average-novel-readers know it is such folk who\nare to-day making in America that portion of our literature which may\nhope for permanency.\n\nDumbarton Grange\n  1914-1916\n\n\n\n\nBELHS CAVALIERS\n\n\n\"_For this RAIMBAUT DE VAQUIERAS lived at a time when prolonged habits\nof extra-mundane contemplation, combined with the decay of real\nknowledge, were apt to volatilize the thoughts and aspirations of the\nbest and wisest into dreamy unrealities, and to lend a false air of\nmysticism to love. . . .  It is as if the intellect and the will had\nbecome used to moving paralytically among visions, dreams, and mystic\nterrors, weighed down with torpor._\"\n\n\n  Fair friend, since that hour I took leave of thee\n  I have not slept nor stirred from off my knee,\n  But prayed alway to God, S. Mary's Son,\n  To give me back my true companion;\n      And soon it will be Dawn.\n\n  Fair friend, at parting, thy behest to me\n  Was that all sloth I should eschew and flee,\n  And keep good Watch until the Night was done:\n  Now must my Song and Service pass for none?\n      For soon it will be Dawn.\n\n  RAIMBAUT DE VAQUIERAS.--_Aubade, from F. York Powell's version_.\n\n\n\n\nBELHS CAVALIERS\n\n\nYou may read elsewhere of the long feud that was between Guillaume de\nBaux, afterward Prince of Orange, and his kinsman Raimbaut de\nVaquieras.  They were not reconciled until their youth was dead.  Then,\nwhen Messire Raimbaut returned from battling against the Turks and the\nBulgarians, in the 1,210th year from man's salvation, the Archbishop of\nRheims made peace between the two cousins; and, attended by Makrisi, a\nconverted Saracen who had followed the knight's fortunes for well nigh\na quarter of a century, the Sire de Vaquieras rode homeward.\n\nMany slain men were scattered along the highway when he came again into\nVenaissin, in April, after an absence of thirty years.  The crows whom\nhis passing disturbed were too sluggish for long flights and many of\nthem did not heed him at all.  Guillaume de Baux was now undisputed\nmaster of these parts, although, as this host of mute, hacked and\npartially devoured witnesses attested, the contest had been dubious for\na while: but now Lovain of the Great-Tooth, Prince Guillaume's last\ncompetitor, was captured; the forces of Lovain were scattered; and of\nLovain's lieutenants only Mahi de Vernoil was unsubdued.\n\nPrince Guillaume laughed a little when he told his kinsman of the\nposture of affairs, as more loudly did Guillaume's gross son, Sire\nPhilibert.  But Madona Biatritz did not laugh.  She was the widow of\nGuillaume's dead brother--Prince Conrat, whom Guillaume succeeded--and\nit was in her honor that Raimbaut had made those songs which won him\neminence as a practitioner of the Gay Science.\n\nBiatritz said, \"It is a long while since we two met.\"\n\nHe that had been her lover all his life said, \"Yes.\"\n\nShe was no longer the most beautiful of women, no longer his be-hymned\nBelhs Cavaliers--you may read elsewhere how he came to call her that in\nall his canzons--but only a fine and gracious stranger.  It was\nuniformly gray, that soft and plentiful hair, where once such gold had\nflamed as dizzied him to think of even now; there was no crimson in\nthese thinner lips; and candor would have found her eyes less wonderful\nthan those Raimbaut had dreamed of very often among an alien and\nhostile people.  But he lamented nothing, and to him she was as ever\nHeaven's most splendid miracle.\n\n\"Yes,\" said this old Raimbaut,--\"and even to-day we have not reclaimed\nthe Sepulcher as yet.  Oh, I doubt if we shall ever win it, now that\nyour brother and my most dear lord is dead.\"  Both thought a while of\nBoniface de Montferrat, their playmate once, who yesterday was King of\nThessalonica and now was so much Macedonian dust.\n\nShe said:  \"This week the Prince sent envoys to my nephew. . . .  And\nso you have come home again----\"  Color had surged into her time-worn\nface, and as she thought of things done long ago this woman's eyes were\nlike the eyes of his young Biatritz.  She said: \"You never married?\"\n\nHe answered:  \"No, I have left love alone.  For Love prefers to take\nrather than to give; against a single happy hour he balances a hundred\nmiseries, and he appraises one pleasure to be worth a thousand pangs.\nPardieu, let this immortal usurer contrive as may seem well to him, for\nI desire no more of his bounty or of his penalties.\"\n\n\"No, we wish earnestly for nothing, either good or bad,\" said Dona\nBiatritz--\"we who have done with loving.\"\n\nThey sat in silence, musing over ancient happenings, and not looking at\neach other, until the Prince came with his guests, who seemed to laugh\ntoo heartily.\n\nGuillaume's frail arm was about his kinsman, and Guillaume chuckled\nover jests and by-words that had been between the cousins as children.\nRaimbaut found them no food for laughter now.  Guillaume told all of\nRaimbaut's oath of fealty, and of how these two were friends and their\nunnatural feud was forgotten.  \"For we grow old,--eh, maker of songs?\"\nhe said; \"and it is time we made our peace with Heaven, since we are\nnot long for this world.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the knight; \"oh yes, we both grow old.\"  He thought of\nanother April evening, so long ago, when this Guillaume de Baux had\nstabbed him in a hedged field near Calais, and had left him under a\nhawthorn bush for dead; and Raimbaut wondered that there was no anger\nin his heart.  \"We are friends now,\" he said.  Biatritz, whom these two\nhad loved, and whose vanished beauty had been the spur of their long\nenmity, sat close to them, and hardly seemed to listen.\n\nThus the evening passed and every one was merry, because the Prince had\novercome Lovain of the Great-Tooth, and was to punish the upstart on\nthe morrow.  But Raimbaut de Vaquieras, a spent fellow, a derelict,\nbarren of aim now that the Holy Wars were over, sat in this unfamiliar\nplace--where when he was young he had laughed as a cock crows!--and\nthought how at the last he had crept home to die as a dependent on his\ncousin's bounty.\n\nThus the evening passed, and at its end Makrisi followed the troubadour\nto his regranted fief of Vaquieras.  This was a chill and brilliant\nnight, swayed by a frozen moon so powerful that no stars showed in the\nunclouded heavens, and everywhere the bogs were curdled with thin ice.\nAn obdurate wind swept like a knife-blade across a world which even in\nits spring seemed very old.\n\n\"This night is bleak and evil,\" Makrisi said.  He rode a coffin's\nlength behind his master.  \"It is like Prince Guillaume, I think.  What\nman will sorrow when dawn comes?\"\n\nRaimbaut de Vaquieras replied:  \"Always dawn comes at last, Makrisi.\"\n\n\"It comes the more quickly, messire, when it is prompted.\"\n\nThe troubadour only smiled at words which seemed so meaningless.  He\ndid not smile when later in the night Makrisi brought Mahi de Vernoil,\ndisguised as a mendicant friar.  This outlaw pleaded with Sire Raimbaut\nto head the tatters of Lovain's army, and showed Raimbaut how easy it\nwould be to wrest Venaissin from Prince Guillaume.  \"We cannot save\nLovain,\" de Vemoil said, \"for Guillaume has him fast.  But Venaissin is\nvery proud of you, my tres beau sire.  Ho, maker of world-famous songs!\nstout champion of the faith! my men and I will now make you Prince of\nOrange in place of the fiend who rules us.  You may then at your\nconvenience wed Madona Biatritz, that most amiable lady whom you have\nloved so long.  And by the Cross! you may do this before the week is\nout.\"\n\nThe old knight answered:  \"It is true that I have always served Madona\nBiatritz, who is of matchless worth.  I might not, therefore, presume\nto call myself any longer her servant were my honor stained in any\nparticular.  Oh no, Messire de Vernoil, an oath is an oath.  I have\nthis day sworn fealty to Guillaume de Baux.\"\n\nThen after other talk Raimbaut dismissed the fierce-eyed little man.\nThe freebooter growled curses as he went.  On a sudden he whistled,\nlike a person considering, and he began to chuckle.\n\nRaimbaut said, more lately:  \"Zoraida left no wholesome legacy in you,\nMakrisi.\"  This Zoraida was a woman the knight had known in\nConstantinople--a comely outlander who had killed herself because of\nSire Raimbaut's highflown avoidance of all womankind except the\nmistress of his youth.\n\n\"Nay, save only in loving you too well, messire, was Zoraida a wise\nwoman, notably. . . .  But this is outworn talk, the prattle of Cain's\nbabyhood.  As matters were, you did not love Zoraida.  So Zoraida died.\nSuch is the custom in my country.\"\n\n\"You trouble me, Makrisi.  Your eyes are like blown coals. . . .  Yet\nyou have served me long and faithfully.  You know that mine was ever\nthe vocation of dealing honorably in battle among emperors, and of\nspreading broadcast the rumor of my valor, and of achieving good by my\nsword's labors.  I have lived by warfare.  Long, long ago, since I\nderived no benefit from love, I cried farewell to it.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Makrisi.  \"Love makes a demi-god of all--just for an hour.\nSuch hours as follow we devote to the concoction of sleeping-draughts.\"\nHe laughed, and very harshly.\n\nAnd Raimbaut did not sleep that night because this life of ours seemed\nsuch a piece of tangle-work as he had not the skill to unravel.  So he\ndevoted the wakeful hours to composition of a planh, lamenting vanished\nyouth and that Biatritz whom the years had stolen.\n\nThen on the ensuing morning, after some talk about the new campaign,\nPrince Guillaume de Baux leaned back in his high chair and said,\nabruptly:\n\n\"In perfect candor, you puzzle your liege-lord.  For you loathe me and\nyou still worship my sister-in-law, an unattainable princess.  In these\ntwo particulars you display such wisdom as would inevitably prompt you\nto make an end of me.  Yet, what the devil! you, the time-battered\nvagabond, decline happiness and a kingdom to boot because of\nyesterday's mummery in the cathedral! because of a mere promise given!\nYes, I have my spies in every rat-hole.  I am aware that my barons hate\nme, and hate Philibert almost as bitterly,--and that, in fine, a\nmajority of my barons would prefer to see you Prince in my unstable\nplace, on account of your praiseworthy molestations of heathenry.  Oh,\nyes, I understand my barons perfectly.  I flatter myself I understand\neverybody in Venaissin save you.\"\n\nRaimbaut answered: \"You and I are not alike.\"\n\n\"No, praise each and every Saint!\" said the Prince of Orange, heartily.\n\"And yet, I am not sure----\"  He rose, for his sight had failed him so\nthat he could not distinctly see you except when he spoke with head\nthrown back, as though he looked at you over a wall.  \"For instance, do\nyou understand that I hold Biatritz here as a prisoner, because her\ndower-lands are necessary to me, and that I intend to marry her as soon\nas Pope Innocent grants me a dispensation?\"\n\n\"All Venaissin knows that.  Yes, you have always gained everything\nwhich you desired in this world, Guillaume.  Yet it was at a price, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"I am no haggler. . . . But you have never comprehended me, not even in\nthe old days when we loved each other.  For instance, do you\nunderstand--slave of a spoken word!--what it must mean to me to know\nthat at this hour to-morrow there will be alive in Venaissin no person\nwhom I hate?\"\n\nMessire de Vaquieras reflected.  His was never a rapid mind.  \"Why, no,\nI do not know anything about hatred,\" he said, at last.  \"I think I\nnever hated any person.\"\n\nGuillaume de Baux gave a half-frantic gesture.  \"Now, Heaven send you\ntroubadours a clearer understanding of what sort of world we live\nin----!\"  He broke off short and growled, \"And yet--sometimes I envy\nyou, Raimbaut!\"\n\nThey rode then into the Square of St. Michel to witness the death of\nLovain.  Guillaume took with him his two new mistresses and all his\nby-blows, each magnificently clothed, as if they rode to a festival.\nAfterward, before the doors of Lovain's burning house, a rope was\nfastened under Lovain's armpits, and he was gently lowered into a pot\nof boiling oil.  His feet cooked first, and then the flesh of his legs,\nand so on upward, while Lovain screamed.  Guillaume in a loose robe of\ngreen powdered with innumerable silver crescents, sat watching, under a\ncanopy woven very long ago in Tarshish, and cunningly embroidered with\nthe figures of peacocks and apes and men with eagles' heads.  His hands\ncaressed each other meditatively.\n\n\nIt was on the afternoon of this day, the last of April, that Sire\nRaimbaut came upon Madona Biatritz about a strange employment in the\nLadies' Court.  There was then a well in the midst of this enclosure,\nwith a granite ledge around it carven with lilies; and upon this she\nleaned, looking down into the water.  In her lap was a rope of pearls,\nwhich one by one she unthreaded and dropped into the well.\n\nClear and warm the weather was.  Without, forests were quickening,\nbranch by branch, as though a green flame smoldered from one bough to\nanother.  Violets peeped about the roots of trees, and all the world\nwas young again.  But here was only stone beneath their feet; and about\nthem showed the high walls and the lead-sheathed towers and the\nparapets and the sunk windows of Guillaume's chateau.  There was no\ncolor anywhere save gray; and Raimbaut and Biatritz were aging people\nnow.  It seemed to him that they were the wraiths of those persons who\nhad loved each other at Montferrat; and that the walls about them and\nthe leaden devils who grinned from every waterspout and all those dark\nand narrow windows were only part of some magic picture, such as a\nsorceress may momentarily summon out of smoke-wreaths, as he had seen\nZoraida do very long ago.\n\nThis woman might have been a wraith in verity, for she was clothed\nthroughout in white, save for the ponderous gold girdle about her\nmiddle.  A white gorget framed the face which was so pinched and shrewd\nand strange; and she peered into the well, smiling craftily.\n\n\"I was thinking death was like this well,\" said Biatritz, without any\ncessation of her singular employment--\"so dark that we may see nothing\nclearly save one faint gleam which shows us, or which seems to show us,\nwhere rest is.  Yes, yes, this is that chaplet which you won in the\ntournament at Montferrat when we were young.  Pearls are the symbol of\ntears, we read.  But we had no time for reading then, no time for\nanything except to be quite happy. . . .  You saw this morning's work.\nRaimbaut, were Satan to go mad he would be such a fiend as this\nGuillaume de Baux who is our master!\"\n\n\"Ay, the man is as cruel as my old opponent, Mourzoufle,\" Sire Raimbaut\nanswered, with a patient shrug.  \"It is a great mystery why such\npersons should win all which they desire of this world.  We can but\nrecognize that it is for some sufficient reason.\"  Then he talked with\nher concerning the aforementioned infamous emperor of the East, against\nwhom the old knight had fought, and of Enrico Dandolo and of King\nBoniface, dead brother to Madona Biatritz, and of much remote,\noutlandish adventuring oversea.  Of Zoraida he did not speak.  And\nBiatritz, in turn, told him of that one child which she had borne her\nhusband, Prince Conrat--a son who died in infancy; and she spoke of\nthis dead baby, who living would have been their monarch, with a sweet\nquietude that wrung the old knight's heart.\n\nThus these spent people sat and talked for a long while, the talk\nveering anywhither just as chance directed.  Blurred gusts of song and\nlaughter would come to them at times from the hall where Guillaume de\nBaux drank with his courtiers, and these would break the tranquil flow\nof speech.  Then, unvexedly, the gentle voice of the speaker, were it\nhis or hers, would resume.\n\nShe said: \"They laugh.  We are not merry.\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied; \"I am not often merry.  There was a time when love\nand its service kept me in continuous joy, as waters invest a fish.  I\nwoke from a high dream. . . .  And then, but for the fear of seeming\ncowardly, I would have extinguished my life as men blow out a candle.\nVanity preserved me, sheer vanity!\"  He shrugged, spreading his hard\nlean hands.  \"Belhs Cavaliers, I grudged my enemies the pleasure of\nseeing me forgetful of valor and noble enterprises.  And so, since\nthen, I have served Heaven, in default of you.\"\n\n\"I would not have it otherwise,\" she said, half as in wonder; \"I would\nnot have you be quite sane like other men.  And I believe,\" she\nadded--still with her wise smile--\"you have derived a deal of comfort,\noff and on, from being heart-broken.\"\n\nHe replied gravely:  \"A man may always, if he will but take the pains,\nbe tolerably content and rise in worth, and yet dispense with love.  He\nhas only to guard himself against baseness, and concentrate his powers\non doing right.  Thus, therefore, when fortune failed me, I persisted\nin acting to the best of my ability.  Though I had lost my lands and my\nloved lady, I must hold fast to my own worth.  Without a lady and\nwithout acreage, it was yet in my power to live a cleanly and honorable\nlife; and I did not wish to make two evils out of one.\"\n\n\"Assuredly, I would not have you be quite sane like other men,\" she\nrepeated.  \"It would seem that you have somehow blundered through long\nyears, preserving always the ignorance of a child, and the blindness of\na child.  I cannot understand how this is possible; nor can I keep from\nsmiling at your high-flown notions; and yet,--I envy you, Raimbaut.\"\n\n\nThus the afternoon passed, and the rule of Prince Guillaume was made\nsecure.  His supper was worthily appointed, for Guillaume loved color\nand music and beauty of every kind, and was on this, the day of his\ntriumph, in a prodigal humor.  Many lackeys in scarlet brought in the\nfirst course, to the sound of exultant drums and pipes, with a blast of\ntrumpets and a waving of banners, so that all hearts were uplifted, and\nGuillaume jested with harsh laughter.\n\nBut Raimbaut de Vaquieras was not mirthful, for he was remembering a\nboy whom he had known of very long ago.  He was swayed by an odd fancy,\nas the men sat over their wine, and jongleurs sang and performed tricks\nfor their diversion, that this boy, so frank and excellent, as yet\nexisted somewhere; and that the Raimbaut who moved these shriveled\nhands before him, on the table there, was only a sad dream of what had\nnever been.  It troubled him, too, to see how grossly these soldiers\nate, for, as a person of refinement, an associate of monarchs, Sire\nRaimbaut when the dishes were passed picked up his meats between the\nindex- and the middle-finger of his left hand, and esteemed it infamous\nmanners to dip any other fingers into the gravy.\n\nGuillaume had left the Warriors' Hall.  Philibert was drunk, and half\nthe men-at-arms were snoring among the rushes, when at the height of\ntheir festivity Makrisi came.  He plucked his master by the sleeve.\n\nA swarthy, bearded Angevin was singing.  His song was one of old Sire\nRaimbaut's famous canzons in honor of Belhs Cavaliers.  The knave was\nsinging blithely:\n\n  _Pus mos Belhs Cavaliers grazitz_\n  _E joys m'es lunhatz e faiditz,_\n  _Don no m' venra jamais conortz;_\n  _Fer qu'ees mayer l'ira e plus fortz--_\n\n\nThe Saracen had said nothing.  He showed a jeweled dagger, and the\nknight arose and followed him out of that uproarious hall.  Raimbaut\nwas bitterly perturbed, though he did not know for what reason, as\nMakrisi led him through dark corridors to the dull-gleaming arras of\nPrince Guillaume's apartments.  In this corridor was an iron lamp swung\nfrom the ceiling, and now, as this lamp swayed slightly and burned low,\nthe tiny flame leaped clear of the wick and was extinguished, and\ndarkness rose about them.\n\nRaimbaut said: \"What do you want of me?  Whose blood is on that knife?\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten it is Walburga's Eve?\" Makrisi said.  Raimbaut did\nnot regret he could not see his servant's countenance.  \"Time was we\nnamed it otherwise and praised another woman than a Saxon wench, but\nlet the new name stand.  It is Walburga's Eve, that little, little hour\nof evil! and all over the world surges the full tide of hell's desire,\nand mischief is a-making now, apace, apace, apace.  People moan in\ntheir sleep, and many pillows are pricked by needles that have sewed a\nshroud.  Cry _Eman hetan_ now, messire! for there are those to-night\nwho find the big cathedrals of your red-roofed Christian towns no more\nimposing than so many pimples on a butler's chin, because they ride so\nhigh, so very high, in this brave moonlight.  Full-tide, full-tide!\"\nMakrisi said, and his voice jangled like a bell as he drew aside the\ncurtain so that the old knight saw into the room beyond.\n\nIt was a place of many lights, which, when thus suddenly disclosed,\nblinded him at first.  Then Raimbaut perceived Guillaume lying a-sprawl\nacross an oaken chest.  The Prince had fallen backward and lay in this\nposture, glaring at the intruders with horrible eyes which did not move\nand would not ever move again.  His breast was crimson, for some one\nhad stabbed him.  A woman stood above the corpse and lighted yet\nanother candle while Raimbaut de Vaquieras waited motionless.  A hand\nmeant only to bestow caresses brushed a lock of hair from this woman's\neyes while he waited.  The movements of this hand were not uncertain,\nbut only quivered somewhat, as a taut wire shivers in the wind, while\nRaimbaut de Vaquieras waited motionless.\n\n\"I must have lights, I must have a host of candles to assure me past\nany questioning that he is dead.  The man is of deep cunning.  I think\nhe is not dead even now.\"  Lightly Biatritz touched the Prince's\nbreast.  \"Strange, that this wicked heart should be so tranquil when\nthere is murder here to make it glad!  Nay, very certainly this\nGuillaume de Baux will rise and laugh in his old fashion before he\nspeaks, and then I shall be afraid.  But I am not afraid as yet.  I am\nafraid of nothing save the dark, for one cannot be merry in the dark.\"\n\nRaimbaut said:  \"This is Belhs Cavaliers whom I have loved my whole\nlife through.  Therefore I do not doubt.  Pardieu, I do not even doubt,\nwho know she is of matchless worth.\"\n\n\"Wherein have I done wrong, Raimbaut?\"  She came to him with fluttering\nhands.  \"Why, but look you, the man had laid an ambuscade in the marsh\nand he meant to kill you there to-night as you rode for Vaquieras.  He\ntold me of it, told me how it was for that end alone he lured you into\nVenaissin----\"  Again she brushed the hair back from her forehead.\n\"Raimbaut, I spoke of God and knightly honor, and the man laughed.  No,\nI think it was a fiend who sat so long beside the window yonder, whence\none may see the marsh.  There were no candles in the room.  The\nmoonlight was upon his evil face, and I could think of nothing, of\nnothing that has been since Adam's time, except our youth, Raimbaut.\nAnd he smiled fixedly, like a white image, because my misery amused\nhim.  Only, when I tried to go to you to warn you, he leaped up\nstiffly, making a mewing noise.  He caught me by the throat so that I\ncould not scream.  Then while we struggled in the moonlight your\nMakrisi came and stabbed him----\"\n\n\"Nay, I but fetched this knife, messire.\"  Makrisi seemed to love that\nbloodied knife.\n\nBiatritz proudly said: \"The man lies, Raimbaut.\"\n\n\"What need to tell me that, Belhs Cavaliers?\"\n\nAnd the Saracen shrugged.  \"It is very true I lie,\" he said.  \"As among\nfriends, I may confess I killed the Prince.  But for the rest, take\nnotice both of you, I mean to lie intrepidly.\"\n\nRaimbaut remembered how his mother had given each of two lads an apple,\nand he had clamored for Guillaume's, as children do, and Guillaume had\nchanged with him.  It was a trivial happening to remember after fifty\nyears; but Guillaume was dead, and this hacked flesh was Raimbaut's\nflesh in part, and the thought of Raimbaut would never trouble\nGuillaume de Baux any more.  In addition there was a fire of juniper\nwood and frankincense upon the hearth, and the room smelt too cloyingly\nof be-drugging sweetness.  Then on the walls were tapestries which\ndepicted Merlin's Dream, so that everywhere recoiling women smiled with\nbold eyes; and here their wantonness seemed out of place.\n\n\"Listen,\" Makrisi was saying; \"listen, for the hour strikes.  At last,\nat last!\" he cried, with a shrill whine of malice.\n\nRaimbaut said, dully:  \"Oh, I do not understand----\"\n\n\"And yet Zoraida loved you once! loved you as people love where I was\nborn!\"  The Saracen's voice had altered.  His speech was like the\nrustle of papers.  \"You did not love Zoraida.  And so it came about\nthat upon Walburga's Eve, at midnight, Zoraida hanged herself beside\nyour doorway.  Thus we love where I was born. . . .  And I, I cut the\nrope--with my left hand.  I had my other arm about that frozen thing\nwhich yesterday had been Zoraida, you understand, so that it might not\nfall.  And in the act a tear dropped from that dead woman's cheek and\nwetted my forehead.  Ice is not so cold as was that tear. . . .  Ho,\nthat tear did not fall upon my forehead but on my heart, because I\nloved that dancing-girl, Zoraida, as you do this princess here.  I\nthink you will understand,\" Makrisi said, calmly as one who states a\nmaxim.\n\nThe Sire de Vaquieras replied, in the same tone: \"I understand.  You\nhave contrived my death?\"\n\n\"Ey, messire, would that be adequate?  I could have managed that any\nhour within the last score of years.  Oh no! for I have studied you\ncarefully.  Oh no!  instead, I have contrived this plight.  For the\nPrince of Orange is manifestly murdered.  Who killed him?--why, Madona\nBiatritz, and none other, for I will swear to it.  I, I will swear to\nit, who saw it done.  Afterward both you and I must be questioned upon\nthe rack, as possibly concerned in the affair, and whether innocent or\nguilty we must die very horribly.  Such is the gentle custom of your\nChristian country when a prince is murdered.  That is not the point of\nthe jest, however.  For first Sire Philibert will put this woman to the\nQuestion by Water, until she confesses her confederates, until she\nconfesses that every baron whom Philibert distrusts was one of them.\nOh yes, assuredly they will thrust a hollow cane into the mouth of your\nBiatritz, and they will pour water a little by a little through this\ncane, until she confesses what they desire.  Ha, Philibert will see to\nthis confession!  And through this woman's torment he will rid himself\nof every dangerous foe he has in Venaissin.  You must stand by and wait\nyour turn.  You must stand by, in fetters, and see this done--you, you,\nmy master!--you, who love this woman as I loved that dead Zoraida who\nwas not fair enough to please you!\"\n\nRaimbaut, trapped, impotent, cried out: \"This is not possible----\"  And\nfor all that, he knew the Saracen to be foretelling the inevitable.\n\nMakrisi went on, quietly:  \"After the Question men will parade her,\nnaked to the middle, through all Orange, until they reach the\nMarketplace, where will be four horses.  One of these horses they will\nharness to each arm and leg of your Biatritz.  Then they will beat\nthese horses.  These will be strong horses.  They will each run in a\ndifferent direction.\"\n\nThis infamy also was certain.  Raimbaut foresaw what he must do.  He\nclutched the dagger which Makrisi fondled.  \"Belhs Cavaliers, this\nfellow speaks the truth.  Look now, the moon is old--is it not strange\nto know it will outlive us?\"\n\nAnd Biatritz came close to Sire Raimbaut and said: \"I understand.  If I\nleave this room alive it will purchase a hideous suffering for my poor\nbody, it will bring about the ruin of many brave and innocent\nchevaliers.  I know.  I would perforce confess all that the masked men\nbade me.  I know, for in Prince Conrat's time I have seen persons who\nhad been put to the Question----\"  She shuddered; and she re-began,\nwithout any agitation:  \"Give me the knife, Raimbaut.\"\n\n\"Pardieu! but I may not obey you for this once,\" he answered, \"since we\nare informed by those in holy orders that all such as lay violent hands\nupon themselves must suffer eternally.\"  Then, kneeling, he cried, in\nan extremity of adoration:  \"Oh, I have served you all my life.  You\nmay not now deny me this last service.  And while I talk they dig your\ngrave!  O blind men, making the new grave, take heed lest that grave be\ntoo narrow, for already my heart is breaking in my body.  I have drunk\ntoo deep of sorrow.  And yet I may not fail you, now that honor and\nmercy and my love for you demand I kill you before I also die--in such\na fashion as this fellow speaks of.\"\n\nShe did not dispute this.  How could she when it was an axiom in all\nCourts of Love that Heaven held dominion in a lover's heart only as an\nunderling of the man's mistress?\n\nAnd so she said, with a fond smile:  \"It is your demonstrable\nprivilege.  I would not grant it, dear, were my weak hands as clean as\nyours.  Oh, but it is long you have loved me, and it is faithfully you\nhave served Heaven, and my heart too is breaking in my body now that\nyour service ends!\"\n\nAnd he demanded, wearily:  \"When we were boy and girl together what had\nwe said if any one had told us this would be the end?\"\n\n\"We would have laughed.  It is a long while since those children\nlaughed at Montferrat. . . . Not yet, not yet!\" she said.  \"Ah, pity\nme, tried champion, for even now I am almost afraid to die.\"\n\nShe leaned against the window yonder, shuddering, staring into the\nnight.  Dawn had purged the east of stars.  Day was at hand, the day\nwhose noon she might not hope to witness.  She noted this incuriously.\nThen Biatritz came to him, very strangely proud, and yet all tenderness.\n\n\"See, now, Raimbaut! because I have loved you as I have loved nothing\nelse in life, I will not be unworthy of your love.  Strike and have\ndone.\"\n\nRaimbaut de Vaquieras raised an already bloodied dagger.  As emotion\ngoes, he was bankrupt.  He had no longer any dread of hell, because he\nthought that, a little later, nothing its shrewdest overseer could plan\nwould have the power to vex him.  She, waiting, smiled.  Makrisi,\nseated, stretched his legs, put fingertips together with the air of an\nattendant amateur.  This was better than he had hoped.  In such a\nposture they heard a bustle of armored men, and when all turned, saw\nhow a sword protruded through the arras.\n\n\"Come out, Guillaume!\" people were shouting.  \"Unkennel, dog!  Out,\nout, and die!\"  To such a heralding Mahi de Vernoil came into the room\nwith mincing steps such as the man affected in an hour of peril.  He\nfirst saw what a grisly burden the chest sustained.  \"Now, by the\nFace!\" he cried, \"if he that cheated me of quieting this filth should\nprove to be of gentle birth I will demand of him a duel to the death!\"\nThe curtains were ripped from their hangings as he spoke, and behind\nhim the candlelight was reflected by the armor of many followers.\n\nThen de Vernoil perceived Raimbaut de Vaquieras, and the spruce little\nman bowed ceremoniously.  All were still.  Composedly, like a\nlieutenant before his captain, Mahi narrated how these hunted remnants\nof Lovain's army had, as a last cast, that night invaded the chateau,\nand had found, thanks to the festival, its men-at-arms in uniform and\ninefficient drunkenness.  \"My tres beau sire,\" Messire de Vernoil\nended, \"will you or nill you, Venaissin is yours this morning.  My\nknaves have slain Philibert and his bewildered fellow-tipplers with\nless effort than is needed to drown as many kittens.\"\n\nAnd his followers cried, as upon a signal: \"Hail, Prince of Orange!\"\n\nIt was so like the wonder-working of a dream--this sudden and heroic\nuproar--that old Raimbaut de Vaquieras stood reeling, near to intimacy\nwith fear for the first time.  He waited thus, with both hands pressed\nbefore his eyes.  He waited thus for a long while, because he was not\nused to find chance dealing kindlily with him.  Later he saw that\nMakrisi had vanished in the tumult, and that many people awaited his\nspeaking.\n\nThe lord of Venaissin began: \"You have done me a great service, Messire\nde Vemoil.  As recompense, I give you what I may.  I freely yield you\nall my right in Venaissin.  Oh no, kingcraft is not for me.  I daily\nsee and hear of battles won, cities beleaguered, high towers\noverthrown, and ancient citadels and new walls leveled with the dust.\nI have conversed with many kings, the directors of these events, and\nthey were not happy people.  Yes, yes, I have witnessed divers\nhappenings, for I am old. . . .  I have found nothing which can serve\nme in place of honor.\"\n\nHe turned to Dona Biatritz.  It was as if they were alone.  \"Belhs\nCavaliers,\" he said, \"I had sworn fealty to this Guillaume.  He\nviolated his obligations; but that did not free me of mine.  An oath is\nan oath.  I was, and am to-day, sworn to support his cause, and to\nprofit in any fashion by its overthrow would be an abominable action.\nNay, more, were any of his adherents alive it would be my manifest duty\nto join them against our preserver, Messire de Vernoil.  This necessity\nis very happily spared me.  I cannot, though, in honor hold any fief\nunder the supplanter of my liege-lord.  I must, therefore, relinquish\nVaquieras and take eternal leave of Venaissin.  I will not lose the\nright to call myself your servant!\" he cried out--\"and that which is\nnoblest in the world must be served fittingly.  And so, Belhs\nCavaliers, let us touch palms and bid farewell, and never in this life\nspeak face to face of trivial happenings which we two alone remember.\nFor naked of lands and gear I came to you--a prince's daughter--very\nlong ago, and as nakedly I now depart, so that I may retain the right\nto say, 'All my life long I served my love of her according to my\nabilities, wholeheartedly and with clean hands.'\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! you must depart from Venaissin,\" said Dona Biatritz.  A\ncapable woman, she had no sympathy with his exquisite points of honor,\nand yet loved him all the more because of what seemed to her his\nsurpassing folly.  She smiled, somewhat as mothers do in humoring an\nunreasonable boy.  \"We will go to my nephew's court at Montferrat,\" she\nsaid.  \"He will willingly provide for his old aunt and her husband.\nAnd you may still make verses--at Montferrat, where we lived verses,\nonce, Raimbaut.\"\n\nNow they gazed full upon each other.  Thus they stayed, transfigured,\nneither seeming old.  Each had forgotten that unhappiness existed\nanywhere in the whole world.  The armored, blood-stained men about them\nwere of no more importance than were those wantons in the tapestry.\nWithout, dawn throbbed in heaven.  Without, innumerable birds were\nraising that glad, piercing, hurried morning-song which very anciently\ncaused Adam's primal waking, to behold his mate.\n\n\n\n\nBALTHAZAR'S DAUGHTER\n\n\n\"_A curious preference for the artificial should be mentioned as\ncharacteristic of ALESSANDRO DE MEDICI'S poetry.  For his century was\nanything but artless; the great commonplaces that form the main stock\nof human thought were no longer in their first flush, and he addressed\na people no longer childish. . . .  Unquestionably his fancies were\nfantastic, anti-natural, bordering on hallucination, and they betray a\ndesire for impossible novelty; but it is allowable to prefer them to\nthe sickly simplicity of those so-called poems that embroider with old\nfaded wools upon the canvas of worn-out truisms, trite, trivial and\nidiotically sentimental patterns._\"\n\n\n  Let me have dames and damsels richly clad\n    To feed and tend my mirth,\n  Singing by day and night to make me glad;\n\n  Let me have fruitful gardens of great girth\n    Fill'd with the strife of birds,\n  With water-springs, and beasts that house i' the earth.\n\n  Let me seem Solomon for lore of words,\n  Samson for strength, for beauty Absalom.\n\n    Knights as my serfs be given;\n  And as I will, let music go and come;\n  Till, when I will, I will to enter Heaven.\n\n  ALESSANDRO DE MEDICI.--_Madrigal, from D. G. Rossetti's version_.\n\n\n\n\nBALTHAZAR'S DAUGHTER\n\nGraciosa was Balthazar's youngest child, a white, slim girl with violet\neyes and strange pale hair which had the color and glitter of stardust.\n\"Some day at court,\" her father often thought complacently, \"she, too,\nwill make a good match.\"  He was a necessitous lord, a smiling, supple\nman who had already marketed two daughters to his advantage.  But\nGraciosa's time was not yet mature in the year of grace 1533, for the\ngirl was not quite sixteen.  So Graciosa remained in Balthazar's big\ncheerless house and was tutored in all needful accomplishments.  She\nwas proficient in the making of preserves and unguents, could play the\nharpsichord and the virginals acceptably, could embroider an altarcloth\nto admiration, and, in spite of a trivial lameness in walking, could\ndance a coranto or a saraband against any woman between two seas.\n\nNow to the north of Balthazar's home stood a tall forest, overhanging\nboth the highway and the river whose windings the highway followed.\nGraciosa was very often to be encountered upon the outskirts of these\nwoods.  She loved the forest, whose tranquillity bred dreams, but was\nalready a woman in so far that she found it more interesting to watch\nthe highway.  Sometimes it would be deserted save for small purple\nbutterflies which fluttered about as if in continuous indecision, and\nrarely ascended more than a foot above the ground.  But people passed\nat intervals--as now a page, who was a notably fine fellow, clothed in\nash-colored gray, with slashed, puffed sleeves, and having a heron's\nfeather in his cap; or a Franciscan with his gown tucked up so that you\nsaw how the veins on his naked feet stood out like the carvings on a\nvase; or a farmer leading a calf; or a gentleman in a mantle of\nsquirrel's fur riding beside a wonderful proud lady, whose tiny hat was\nembroidered with pearls.  It was all very interesting to watch, it was\nlike turning over the leaves of a book written in an unknown tongue and\nguessing what the pictures meant, because these people were intent upon\ntheir private avocations, in which you had no part, and you would never\nsee them any more.\n\nThen destiny took a hand in the affair and Guido came.  He reined his\ngray horse at the sight of her sitting by the wayside and deferentially\ninquired how far it might be to the nearest inn.  Graciosa told him.\nHe thanked her and rode on.  That was all, but the appraising glance of\nthis sedate and handsome burgher obscurely troubled the girl afterward.\n\nNext day he came again.  He was a jewel-merchant, he told her, and he\nthought it within the stretch of possibility that my lord Balthazar's\ndaughter might wish to purchase some of his wares.  She viewed them\nwith admiration, chaffered thriftily, and finally bought a topaz, dug\nfrom Mount Zabarca, Guido assured her, which rendered its wearer immune\nto terrors of any kind.\n\nVery often afterward these two met on the outskirts of the forest as\nGuido rode between the coast and the hill-country about his vocation.\nSometimes he laughingly offered her a bargain, on other days he paused\nto exhibit a notable gem which he had procured for this or that wealthy\namateur.  Count Eglamore, the young Duke's favorite yonder at court,\nbought most of them, it seemed.  \"The nobles complain against this\nupstart Eglamore very bitterly,\" said Guido, \"but we merchants have no\nquarrel with him.  He buys too lavishly.\"\n\n\"I trust I shall not see Count Eglamore when I go to court,\" said\nGraciosa, meditatively; \"and, indeed, by that time, my father assures\nme, some honest gentleman will have contrived to cut the throat of this\nabominable Eglamore.\"  Her father's people, it should be premised, had\nbeen at bitter feud with the favorite ever since he detected and\npunished the conspiracy of the Marquis of Cibo, their kinsman.  Then\nGraciosa continued:  \"Nevertheless, I shall see many beautiful sights\nwhen I am taken to court. . . .  And the Duke, too, you tell me, is an\namateur of gems.\"\n\n\"Eh, madonna, I wish that you could see his jewels,\" cried Guido,\ngrowing fervent; and he lovingly catalogued a host of lapidary marvels.\n\n\"I hope that I shall see these wonderful jewels when I go to court,\"\nsaid Graciosa wistfully.\n\n\"Duke Alessandro,\" he returned, his dark eyes strangely mirthful, \"is,\nas I take it, a catholic lover of beauty in all its forms.  So he will\nshow you his gems, very assuredly, and, worse still, he will make\nverses in your honor.  For it is a preposterous feature of Duke\nAlessandro's character that he is always making songs.\"\n\n\"Oh, and such strange songs as they are, too, Guido.  Who does not know\nthem?\"\n\n\"I am not the best possible judge of his verses' merit,\" Guido\nestimated, drily.  \"But I shall never understand how any singer at all\ncame to be locked in such a prison.  I fancy that at times the paradox\npuzzles even Duke Alessandro.\"\n\n\"And is he as handsome as people report?\"\n\nThen Guido laughed a little.  \"Tastes differ, of course.  But I think\nyour father will assure you, madonna, that no duke possessing such a\nzealous tax-collector as Count Eglamore was ever in his lifetime\nconsidered of repulsive person.\"\n\n\"And is he young?\"\n\n\"Why, as to that, he is about of an age with me, and in consequence old\nenough to be far more sensible than either of us is ever likely to be,\"\nsaid Guido; and began to talk of other matters.\n\nBut presently Graciosa was questioning him again as to the court,\nwhither she was to go next year and enslave a marquis, or, at worst, an\nopulent baron.  Her thoughts turned toward the court's predominating\nfigure.  \"Tell me of Eglamore, Guido.\"\n\n\"Madonna, some say that Eglamore was a brewer's son.  Others--and your\nfather's kinsmen in particular--insist that he was begot by a devil in\nperson, just as Merlin was, and Plato the philosopher, and puissant\nAlexander.  Nobody knows anything about his origin.\" Guido was sitting\nupon the ground, his open pack between his knees.  Between the thumb\nand forefinger of each hand he held caressingly a string of pearls\nwhich he inspected as he talked.  \"Nobody,\" he idly said, \"nobody is\nvery eager to discuss Count Eglamore's origin now that Eglamore has\nbecome indispensable to Duke Alessandro.  Yes, it is thanks to Eglamore\nthat the Duke has ample leisure and needful privacy for the pursuit of\nrecreations which are reputed to be curious.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, Guido.\"  Graciosa was all wonder.\n\n\"It is perhaps as well,\" the merchant said, a trifle sadly.  Then Guido\nshrugged.  \"To be brief, madonna, business annoys the Duke.  He finds\nin this Eglamore an industrious person who affixes seals, draughts\nproclamations, makes treaties, musters armies, devises pageants, and\ncollects revenues, upon the whole, quite as efficiently as Alessandro\nwould be capable of doing these things.  So Alessandro makes verses and\namuses himself as his inclinations prompt, and Alessandro's people are\nnone the worse off on account of it.\"\n\n\"Heigho, I foresee that I shall never fall in love with the Duke,\"\nGraciosa declared.  \"It is unbefitting and it is a little cowardly for\na prince to shirk the duties of his station.  Now, if I were Duke I\nwould grant my father a pension, and have Eglamore hanged, and purchase\na new gown of silvery green, in which I would be ravishingly beautiful,\nand afterward-- Why, what would you do if you were Duke, Messer Guido?\"\n\n\"What would I do if I were Duke?\" he echoed.  \"What would I do if I\nwere a great lord instead of a tradesman?  I think you know the answer,\nmadonna.\"\n\n\"Oh, you would make me your duchess, of course.  That is quite\nunderstood,\" said Graciosa, with the lightest of laughs.  \"But I was\nspeaking seriously, Guido.\"\n\nGuido at that considered her intently for a half-minute.  His\ncountenance was of portentous gravity, but in his eyes she seemed to\ndetect a lurking impishness.\n\n\"And it is not a serious matter that a peddler of crystals should have\ndared to love a nobleman's daughter?  You are perfectly right.  That I\nworship you is an affair which does not concern any person save myself\nin any way whatsoever, although I think that knowledge of the fact\nwould put your father to the trouble of sharpening his dagger. . . .\nIndeed, I am not certain that I worship you, for in order to adore\nwholeheartedly, the idolater must believe his idol to be perfect.  Now,\nyour nails are of an ugly shape, like that of little fans; your mouth\nis too large; and I have long ago perceived that you are a trifle lame\nin spite of your constant care to conceal the fact.  I do not admire\nthese faults, for faults they are undoubtedly.  Then, too, I know you\nare vain and self-seeking, and look forward contentedly to the time\nwhen your father will transfer his ownership of such physical\nattractions as heaven gave you to that nobleman who offers the highest\nprice for them.  It is true you have no choice in the matter, but you\nwill participate in a monstrous bargain, and I would prefer to have you\nexhibit distaste for it.\"  And with that he returned composedly to\ninspection of his pearls.\n\n\"And to what end, Guido?\"  It was the first time Graciosa had\ncompletely waived the reticence of a superior caste.  You saw that the\nchild's parted lips were tremulous, and you divined her childish fits\nof dreading that glittering, inevitable court-life shared with an\nunimaginable husband.\n\nBut Guido only grumbled whimsically.  \"I am afraid that men do not\nalways love according to the strict laws of logic.  I desire your\nhappiness above all things; yet to see you so abysmally untroubled by\nanything that troubles me is another matter.\"\n\n\"But I am not untroubled, Guido----\" she began swiftly.  Graciosa broke\noff in speech, shrugged, flashed a smile at him.  \"For I cannot fathom\nyou, Ser Guido, and that troubles me.  Yes, I am very fond of you, and\nyet I do not trust you.  You tell me you love me greatly.  It pleases\nme to have you say this.  You perceive I am very candid this morning,\nMesser Guido.  Yes, it pleases me, and I know that for the sake of\nseeing me you daily endanger your life, for if my father heard of our\nmeetings he would have you killed.  You would not incur such\nhare-brained risks unless you cared very greatly; and yet, somehow, I\ndo not believe it is altogether for me you care.\"\n\nThen Guido was in train to protest an all-mastering and entirely candid\ndevotion, but he was interrupted.\n\n\"Most women have these awkward intuitions,\" spoke a melodious voice,\nand turning, Graciosa met the eyes of the intruder.  This magnificent\nyoung man had a proud and bloodless face which contrasted sharply with\nhis painted lips and cheeks.  In the contour of his protruding mouth\nshowed plainly his negroid ancestry.  His scanty beard, as well as his\nfrizzled hair, was the color of dead grass.  He was sumptuously clothed\nin white satin worked with silver, and around his cap was a gold chain\nhung with diamonds.  Now he handed his fringed riding-gloves to Guido\nto hold.\n\n\"Yes, madonna, I suspect that Eglamore here cares greatly for the fact\nthat you are Lord Balthazar's daughter, and cousin to the late Marquis\nof Cibo.  For Cibo has many kinsmen at court who still resent the\ncircumstance that the matching of his wits against Eglamore's earned\nfor Cibo a deplorably public demise.  So they conspire against Eglamore\nwith vexatious industry, as an upstart, as a nobody thrust over people\nof proven descent, and Eglamore goes about in hourly apprehension of a\nknife-thrust.  If he could make a match with you, though, your\nfather--thrifty man!--would be easily appeased.  Your cousins, those\nproud, grumbling Castel-Franchi, Strossi and Valori, would not prove\nover-obdurate toward a kinsman who, whatever his past indiscretions,\nhas so many pensions and offices at his disposal.  Yes, honor would\npermit a truce, and Eglamore could bind them to his interests within\nten days, and be rid of the necessity of sleeping in chain armor. . . .\nHave I not unraveled the scheme correctly, Eglamore?\"\n\n\"Your highness was never lacking in penetration,\" replied the other in\na dull voice.  He stood motionless, holding the gloves, his shoulders a\nlittle bowed as if under some physical load.  His eyes were fixed upon\nthe ground.  He divined the change in Graciosa's face and did not care\nto see it.\n\n\"And so you are Count Eglamore,\" said Graciosa in a sort of whisper.\n\"That is very strange.  I had thought you were my friend, Guido.  But I\nforget.  I must not call you Guido any longer.\"  She gave a little\nshiver here.  He stayed motionless and did not look at her.  \"I have\noften wondered what manner of man you were.  So it was you--whose hand\nI touched just now--you who poisoned Duke Cosmo, you who had the good\ncardinal assassinated, you who betrayed the brave lord of Faenza!  Oh,\nyes, they openly accuse you of every imaginable crime--this patient\nEglamore, this reptile who has crept into his power through filthy\npassages.  It is very strange you should be capable of so much\nwickedness, for to me you seem only a sullen lackey.\"\n\nHe winced and raised his eyes at this.  His face remained\nexpressionless.  He knew these accusations at least to be demonstrable\nlies, for as it happened he had never found his advancement to hinge\nupon the commission of the crimes named.  But even so, the past was a\ncemetery he did not care to have revivified.\n\n\"And it was you who detected the Marquis of Cibo's conspiracy.\nTebaldeo was my cousin, Count Eglamore, and I loved him.  We were\nreared together.  We used to play here in these woods, and I remember\nhow Tebaldeo once fetched me a wren's nest from that maple yonder.  I\nstood just here.  I was weeping because I was afraid he would fall.  If\nhe had fallen and been killed, it would have been the luckier for him,\"\nGraciosa sighed.  \"They say that he conspired.  I do not know.  I only\nknow that by your orders, Count Eglamore, my playmate Tebaldeo was\nfastened upon a Saint Andrew's cross and his arms and legs were each\nbroken in two places with an iron bar.  Then your servants took\nTebaldeo, still living, and laid him upon a carriage-wheel which was\nhung upon a pivot.  The upper edge of this wheel was cut with very fine\nteeth like those of a saw, so that his agony might be complete.\nTebaldeo's poor mangled legs were folded beneath his body so that his\nheels touched the back of his head, they tell me.  In such a posture he\ndied very slowly while the wheel turned very slowly there in the sunlit\nmarket-place, and flies buzzed greedily about him, and the shopkeepers\ntook holiday in order to watch Tebaldeo die--the same Tebaldeo who once\nfetched me a wren's nest from yonder maple.\"\n\nEglamore spoke now.  \"I gave orders for the Marquis of Cibo's\nexecution.  I did not devise the manner of his death.  The punishment\nfor Cibo's crime was long ago fixed by our laws.  Cibo plotted to kill\nthe Duke.  Cibo confessed as much.\"\n\nBut the girl waved this aside.  \"And then you plan this masquerade.\nYou plan to make me care for you so greatly that even when I know you\nto be Count Eglamore I must still care for you.  You plan to marry me,\nso as to placate Tebaldeo's kinsmen, so as to bind them to your\ninterests.  It was a fine bold stroke of policy, I know, to use me as a\nstepping-stone to safety--but was it fair to me?\"  Her voice rose now a\nlittle.  She seemed to plead with him.  \"Look you, Count Eglamore, I\nwas a child only yesterday.  I have never loved any man.  But you have\nloved many women, I know, and long experience has taught you many ways\nof moving a woman's heart.  Oh, was it fair, was it worth while, to\nmatch your skill against my ignorance?  Think how unhappy I would be if\neven now I loved you, and how I would loathe myself. . . .  But I am\ngetting angry over nothing.  Nothing has happened except that I have\ndreamed in idle moments of a brave and comely lover who held his head\nso high that all other women envied me, and now I have awakened.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it was with tears in his eyes that the young man in white\nhad listened to her quiet talk, for you could nowhere have found a\nnature more readily sensitive than his to all the beauty and wonder\nwhich life, as if it were haphazardly, produces every day.  He pitied\nthis betrayed child quite ineffably, because in her sorrow she was so\npretty.\n\nSo he spoke consolingly.  \"Fie, Donna Graciosa, you must not be too\nharsh with Eglamore.  It is his nature to scheme, and he weaves his\nplots as inevitably as the spider does her web.  Believe me, it is\nwiser to forget the rascal--as I do--until there is need of him; and I\nthink you will have no more need to consider Eglamore's trickeries, for\nyou are very beautiful, Graciosa.\"\n\nHe had drawn closer to the girl, and he brought a cloying odor of\nfrangipani, bergamot and vervain.  His nostrils quivered, his face had\ntaken on an odd pinched look, for all that he smiled as over some\noccult jest.  Graciosa was a little frightened by his bearing, which\nwas both furtive and predatory.\n\n\"Oh, do not be offended, for I have some rights to say what I desire in\nthese parts.  For, _Dei gratia_, I am the overlord of these parts,\nGraciosa--a neglected prince who wondered over the frequent absences of\nhis chief counselor and secretly set spies upon him.  Eglamore here\nwill attest as much.  Or if you cannot believe poor Eglamore any\nlonger, I shall have other witnesses within the half-hour.  Oh, yes,\nthey are to meet me here at noon--some twenty crop-haired stalwart\ncut-throats.  They will come riding upon beautiful broad-chested horses\ncovered with red velvet trappings that are hung with little silver\nbells which jingle delightfully.  They will come very soon, and then we\nwill ride back to court.\"\n\nDuke Alessandro touched his big painted mouth with his forefinger as if\nin fantastic mimicry of a man imparting a confidence.\n\n\"I think that I shall take you with me, Graciosa, for you are very\nbeautiful.  You are as slim as a lily and more white, and your eyes are\ntwo purple mirrors in each of which I see a tiny image of Duke\nAlessandro.  The woman I loved yesterday was a big splendid wench with\ncheeks like apples.  It is not desirable that women should be so large.\nAll women should be little creatures that fear you.  They should have\nthin, plaintive voices, and in shrinking from you be as slight to the\ntouch as a cobweb.  It is not possible to love a woman ardently unless\nyou comprehend how easy it would be to murder her.\"\n\n\"God, God!\" said Count Eglamore, very softly, for he was familiar with\nthe look which had now come into Duke Alessandro's face.  Indeed, all\npersons about court were quick to notice this odd pinched look, like\nthat of a traveler nipped at by frosts, and people at court became\nobsequious within the instant in dealing with the fortunate woman who\nhad aroused this look, Count Eglamore remembered.\n\nAnd the girl did not speak at all, but stood motionless, staring in\nbewildered, pitiable, childlike fashion, and the color had ebbed from\nher countenance.\n\nAlessandro was frankly pleased.  \"You fear me, do you not, Graciosa?\nSee, now, when I touch your hand it is soft and cold as a serpent's\nskin, and you shudder.  I am very tired of women who love me, of all\nwomen with bold, hungry eyes.  To you my touch will always be a\nmartyrdom, you will always loathe me, and therefore I shall not weary\nof you for a long while.  Come, Graciosa.  Your father shall have all\nthe wealth and state that even his greedy imaginings can devise, so\nlong as you can contrive to loathe me.  We will find you a suitable\nhusband.  You shall have flattery and titles, gold and fine glass, soft\nstuffs and superb palaces such as are your beauty's due henceforward.\"\n\nHe glanced at the peddler's pack, and shrugged.  \"So Eglamore has been\nwooing you with jewels!  You must see mine, dear Graciosa.  It is not\nmerely an affair of possessing, as some emperors do, all the four kinds\nof sapphires, the twelve kinds of emeralds, the three kinds of rubies,\nand many extraordinary pearls, diamonds, cymophanes, beryls, green\nperidots, tyanos, sandrastra, and fiery cinnamon-stones\"--he enumerated\nthem with the tender voice of their lover--\"for the value of these may\nat least be estimated.  Oh, no, I have in my possession gems which have\nnot their fellows in any other collection, gems which have not even a\nname and the value of which is incalculable--strange jewels that were\nshot from inaccessible mountain peaks by means of slings, jewels\nengendered by the thunder, jewels taken from the heart of the Arabian\ndeer, jewels cut from the brain of a toad and the eyes of serpents, and\neven jewels that are authentically known to have fallen from the moon.\nWe will select the rarest, and have a pair of slippers encrusted with\nthem, in which you shall dance for me.\"\n\n\"Highness,\" cried Eglamore, with anger and terror at odds in his\nbreast, \"Highness, I love this girl!\"\n\n\"Ah, then you cannot ever be her husband,\" Duke Alessandro returned.\n\"You would have suited otherwise.  No, no, we must seek out some other\nperson of discretion.  It will all be very amusing, for I think that\nshe is now quite innocent, as pure as the high angels are.  See,\nEglamore, she cannot speak, she stays still as a lark that has been\ntaken in a snare.  It will be very marvelous to make her as I\nam. . . .\" He meditated, as, obscurely aware of opposition, his\nshoulders twitched fretfully, and momentarily his eyes lightened like\nthe glare of a cannon through its smoke.  \"You made a beast of me, some\nlong-faced people say.  Beware lest the beast turn and rend you.\"\n\nCount Eglamore plucked aimlessly at his chin.  Then he laughed as a dog\nyelps.  He dropped the gloves which he had held till this,\ndeliberately, as if the act were a rite.  His shoulders straightened\nand purpose seemed to flow into the man.  \"No,\" he said quietly, \"I\nwill not have it.  It was not altogether I who made a brain-sick beast\nof you, my prince; but even so, I have never been too nice to profit by\nyour vices.  I have taken my thrifty toll of abomination, I have stood\nby contentedly, not urging you on, yet never trying to stay you, as you\nwaded deeper and ever deeper into the filth of your debaucheries,\nbecause meanwhile you left me so much power.  Yes, in some part it is\nmy own handiwork which is my ruin.  I accept it.  Nevertheless, you\nshall not harm this child.\"\n\n\"I venture to remind you, Eglamore, that I am still the master of this\nduchy.\"  Alessandro was languidly amused, and had begun to regard his\nadversary with real curiosity.\n\n\"Oh, yes, but that is nothing to me.  At court you are the master.  At\ncourt I have seen mothers raise the veil from their daughters' faces,\nwith smiles that were more loathsome than the grimaces of a fiend,\nbecause you happened to be passing.  But here in these woods, your\nhighness, I see only the woman I love and the man who has insulted her.\"\n\n\"This is very admirable fooling,\" the Duke considered.  \"So all the\nworld is changed and Pandarus is transformed into Hector?  These are\nsonorous words, Eglamore, but with what deeds do you propose to back\nthem?\"\n\n\"By killing you, your highness.\"\n\n\"So!\" said the Duke.  \"The farce ascends in interest.\" He drew with a\nflourish, with actual animation, for sottish, debauched and\npower-crazed as this man was, he came of a race to whom danger was a\ncordial.  \"Very luckily a sword forms part of your disguise, so let us\namuse ourselves.  It is always diverting to kill, and if by any chance\nyou kill me I shall at least be rid of the intolerable knowledge that\nto-morrow will be just like to-day.\"  The Duke descended blithely into\nthe level road and placed himself on guard.\n\nThen both men silently went about the business in hand.  Both were\noddly calm, almost as if preoccupied by some more important matter to\nbe settled later.  The two swords clashed, gleamed rigidly for an\ninstant, and then their rapid interplay, so far as vision went, melted\ninto a flickering snarl of silver, for the sun was high and each man's\nshadow was huddled under him.  Then Eglamore thrust savagely and in the\nact trod the edge of a puddle, and fell ignominiously prostrate.  His\nsword was wrenched ten feet from him, for the Duke had parried\nskilfully.  Eglamore lay thus at Alessandro's mercy.\n\n\"Well, well!\" the Duke cried petulantly, \"and am I to be kept waiting\nforever?  You were a thought quicker in obeying my caprices yesterday.\nGet up, you muddy lout, and let us kill each other with some pretension\nof adroitness.\"\n\nEglamore rose, and, sobbing, caught up his sword and rushed toward the\nDuke in an agony of shame and rage.  His attack now was that of a\nfrenzied animal, quite careless of defense and desirous only of murder.\nTwice the Duke wounded him, but it was Alessandro who drew backward,\ncomposedly hindering the brutal onslaught he was powerless to check.\nThen Eglamore ran him through the chest and gave vent to a strangled,\ngrowling cry as Alessandro fell.  Eglamore wrenched his sword free and\ngrasped it by the blade so that he might stab the Duke again and again.\nHe meant to hack the abominable flesh, to slash and mutilate that\nhaughty mask of infamy, but Graciosa clutched his weapon by the hilt.\n\nThe girl panted, and her breath came thick.  \"He gave you your life.\"\n\nEglamore looked up.  She leaned now upon his shoulder, her face\nbrushing his as he knelt over the unconscious Duke; and Eglamore found\nthat at her dear touch all passion had gone out of him.\n\n\"Madonna,\" he said equably, \"the Duke is not yet dead.  It is\nimpossible to let him live.  You may think he voiced only a caprice\njust now.  I think so too, but I know the man, and I know that all this\nmadman's whims are ruthless and irresistible.  Living, Duke\nAlessandro's appetites are merely whetted by opposition, so much so\nthat he finds no pleasures sufficiently piquant unless they have God's\ninterdiction as a sauce.  Living, he will make of you his plaything,\nand a little later his broken, soiled and castby plaything.  It is\ntherefore necessary that I kill Duke Alessandro.\"\n\nShe parted from him, and he too rose to his feet.\n\n\"And afterward,\" she said quietly, \"and afterward you must die just as\nTebaldeo died.\"\n\n\"That is the law, madonna.  But whether Alessandro enters hell to-day\nor later, I am a lost man.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is very true,\" she said.  \"A moment since you were Count\nEglamore, whom every person feared.  Now there is not a beggar in the\nkingdom who would change lots with you, for you are a friendless and\nhunted man in peril of dreadful death.  But even so, you are not\npenniless, Count Eglamore, for these jewels here which formed part of\nyour masquerade are of great value, and there is a world outside.  The\nfrontier is not two miles distant.  You have only to escape into the\nhill-country beyond the forest, and you need not kill Duke Alessandro\nafter all.  I would have you go hence with hands as clean as possible.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I might escape.\"  He found it quaint to note how calm she was\nand how tranquilly his own thoughts ran.  \"But first the Duke must die,\nbecause I dare not leave you to his mercy.\"\n\n\"How does that matter?\" she returned.  \"You know very well that my\nfather intends to market me as best suits his interests.  Here I am so\nmuch merchandise.  The Duke is as free as any other man to cry a\nbargain.\" He would have spoken in protest, but Graciosa interrupted\nwearily:  \"Oh, yes, it is to this end only that we daughters of Duke\nAlessandro's vassals are nurtured, just as you told me--eh, how long\nago!--that such physical attractions as heaven accords us may be\nmarketed.  And I do not see how a wedding can in any way ennoble the\ntransaction by causing it to profane a holy sacrament.  Ah, no,\nBalthazar's daughter was near attaining all that she had been taught to\ndesire, for a purchaser came and he bid lavishly.  You know very well\nthat my father would have been delighted.  But you must need upset the\nbargain.  'No, I will not have it!' Count Eglamore must cry.  It cost\nyou very highly to speak those words.  I think it would have puzzled my\nfather to hear those words at which so many fertile lands, stout\ncastles, well-timbered woodlands, herds of cattle, gilded coaches,\nliveries and curious tapestries, fine clothing and spiced foods, all\nvanished like a puff of smoke.  Ah, yes, my father would have thought\nyou mad.\"\n\n\"I had no choice,\" he said, and waved a little gesture of impotence.\nHe spoke as with difficulty, almost wearily.  \"I love you.  It is a\ntheme on which I do not embroider.  So long as I had thought to use you\nas an instrument I could woo fluently enough.  To-day I saw that you\nwere frightened and helpless--oh, quite helpless.  And something\nchanged in me.  I knew for the first time that I loved you and that I\nwas not clean as you are clean.  What it was of passion and horror, of\ndespair and adoration and yearning, which struggled in my being then I\ncannot tell you.  It spurred me to such action as I took,--but it has\nrobbed me of sugared eloquence, it has left me chary of speech.  It is\nnecessary that I climb very high because of my love for you, and upon\nthe heights there is silence.\"\n\nAnd Graciosa meditated.  \"Here I am so much merchandise.  Heigho, since\nI cannot help it, since bought and sold I must be, one day or another,\nat least I will go at a noble price.  Yet I do not think I am quite\nworth the value of these castles and lands and other things which you\ngave up because of me, so that it will be necessary to make up the\ndifference, dear, by loving you very much.\"\n\nAnd at that he touched her chin, gently and masterfully, for Graciosa\nwould have averted her face, and it seemed to Eglamore that he could\nnever have his fill of gazing on the radiant, shamed tenderness of\nGraciosa's face.  \"Oh, my girl!\" he whispered.  \"Oh, my wonderful,\nworshiped, merry girl, whom God has fashioned with such loving care!\nyou who had only scorn to give me when I was a kingdom's master! and\nwould you go with me now that I am friendless and homeless?\"\n\n\"But I shall always have a friend,\" she answered--\"a friend who showed\nme what Balthazar's daughter was and what love is.  And I am vain\nenough to believe I shall not ever be very far from home so long as I\nam near to my friend's heart.\"\n\nA mortal man could not but take her in his arms.\n\n\"Farewell, Duke Alessandro!\" then said Eglamore; \"farewell, poor clay\nso plastic the least touch remodels you!  I had a part in shaping you\nso bestial; our age, too, had a part--our bright and cruel day, wherein\nyou were set too high.  Yet for me it would perhaps have proved as easy\nto have made a learned recluse of you, Alessandro, or a bloodless\nsaint, if to do that had been as patently profitable.  For you and all\nyour kind are so much putty in the hands of circumspect fellows such as\nI.  But I stood by and let our poisoned age conform that putty into the\nshape of a crazed beast, because it took that form as readily as any\nother, and in taking it, best served my selfish ends.  Now I must pay\nfor that sorry shaping, just as, I think, you too must pay some day.\nAnd so, I cry farewell with loathing, but with compassion also!\"\n\nThen these two turned toward the hills, leaving Duke Alessandro where\nhe lay in the road, a very lamentable figure in much bloodied finery.\nThey turned toward the hills, and entered a forest whose ordering was\ntime's contemporary, and where there was no grandeur save that of the\ntrees.\n\nBut upon the summit of the nearest hill they paused and looked over a\nrestless welter of foliage that glittered in the sun, far down into the\nhighway.  It bustled like an unroofed ant-hill, for the road was alive\nwith men who seemed from this distance very small.  Duke Alessandro's\nattendants had found him and were clustered in a hubbub about their\nreviving master.  Dwarfish Lorenzino de Medici was the most solicitous\namong them.\n\nBeyond was the broad river, seen as a ribbon of silver now, and on its\nremoter bank the leaded roofs of a strong fortress glistened like a\nchild's new toy.  Tilled fields showed here and there, no larger in\nappearance than so many outspread handkerchiefs.  Far down in the east\na small black smudge upon the pearl-colored and vaporous horizon was\nall they could discern of a walled city filled with factories for the\nworking of hemp and furs and alum and silk and bitumen.\n\n\"It is a very rich and lovely land,\" said Eglamore--\"this kingdom which\na half-hour since lay in the hollow of my hand.\"  He viewed it for a\nwhile, and not without pensiveness.  Then he took Graciosa's hand and\nlooked into her face, and he laughed joyously.\n\n\n\n\nJUDITH'S CREED\n\n\n\"_It does not appear that the age thought his works worthy of\nposterity, nor that this great poet himself levied any ideal tribute on\nfuture times, or had any further prospect than of present popularity\nand present profit.  So careless was he, indeed, of fame, that, when he\nretired to ease and plenty, while he was yet little declined into the\nvale of years, and before he could be disgusted with fatigue or\ndisabled by infirmity, he desired only that in this rural quiet he who\nhad so long mazed his imagination by following phantoms might at last\nbe cured of his delirious ecstasies, and as a hermit might estimate the\ntransactions of the world._\"\n\n\n\n\n  Now my charms are all o'erthrown,\n  And what strength I have's my own,\n  Which is most faint.\n\n                    Now I want\n  Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;\n  And my ending is despair,\n  Unless I be relieved by prayer,\n  Which pierces so, that it assaults\n  Mercy itself, and frees all faults.\n\n  As you from crimes would pardon'd be,\n  Let your indulgence set me free.\n\n  WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.--_Epilogue to The Tempest_.\n\n\n\nHe was hoping, while his fingers drummed in unison with the beat of his\nverse, that this last play at least would rouse enthusiasm in the pit.\nThe welcome given its immediate predecessors had undeniably been tepid.\nA memorandum at his elbow of the receipts at the Globe for the last\nquarter showed this with disastrous bluntness; and, after all, in 1609\na shareholder in a theater, when writing dramas for production there,\nwas ordinarily subject to more claims than those of his ideals.\n\nHe sat in a neglected garden whose growth was in reversion to primal\nhabits.  The season was September, the sky a uniform and temperate\nblue.  A peachtree, laden past its strength with fruitage, made about\nhim with its boughs a sort of tent.  The grass around his writing-table\nwas largely hidden by long, crinkled peach leaves--some brown and\nothers gray as yet--and was dotted with a host of brightly-colored\npeaches.  Fidgeting bees and flies were excavating the decayed spots in\nthis wasting fruit, from which emanated a vinous odor.  The bees hummed\ndrowsily, their industry facilitating idleness in others.  It was\ncurious--he meditated, his thoughts straying from \"an uninhabited\nisland\"--how these insects alternated in color between brown velvet and\nsilver, as they blundered about a flickering tessellation of amber and\ndark green . . . in search of rottenness. . . .\n\nHe frowned.  Here was an arid forenoon as imagination went.  A seasoned\nplagiarist by this, he opened a book which lay upon the table among\nseveral others and duly found the chapter entitled _Of the Cannibals_.\n\n\"So, so!\" he said aloud.  \"'It is a nation,' would I answer Plato,\n'that has no kind of traffic, no knowledge of letters----'\"  And with\nthat he sat about reshaping Montaigne's conceptions of Utopia into\nverse.  He wrote--while his left hand held the book flat--as orderly as\nany county-clerk might do in the recordance of a deed of sale.\n\nMidcourse in larceny, he looked up from writing.  He saw a tall, dark\nlady who was regarding him half-sorrowfully and half as in the grasp of\nsome occult amusement.  He said nothing.  He released the telltale\nbook.  His eyebrows lifted, banteringly.  He rose.\n\nHe found it characteristic of her that she went silently to the table\nand compared the printed page with what he had just written.  \"So\nnowadays you have turned pickpocket?  My poet, you have altered.\"\n\nHe said:  \"Why, yes.  When you broke off our friendship, I paid you the\nexpensive compliment of falling very ill.  They thought that I would\ndie.  They tell me even to-day I did not die.  I almost question it.\"\nHe shrugged.  \"And to-day I must continue to write plays, because I\nnever learned any other trade.  And so, at need, I pilfer.\"  The topic\ndid not seem much to concern him.\n\n\"Eh, and such plays!\" the woman cried.  \"My poet, there was a time when\nyou created men and women as glibly as Heaven does.  Now you make\nsugar-candy dolls.\"\n\n\"The last comedies were not all I could have wished,\" he assented.  \"In\nfact, I got only some L30 clear profit.\"\n\n\"There speaks the little tradesman I most hated of all persons living!\"\nthe woman sighed.  Now, as in impatience, she thrust back her\ntraveling-hood and stood bare-headed.\n\nThen she stayed silent,--tall, extraordinarily pallid, and with dark,\nsteady eyes.  Their gaze by ordinary troubled you, as seeming to hint\nsome knowledge to your belittlement.  The playmaker remembered that.\nNow he, a reputable householder, was wondering what would be the upshot\nof this intrusion.  His visitor, as he was perfectly aware, had little\npatience with such moments of life as could not be made dramatic. . . .\nHe was recollecting many trifles, now his mind ran upon old\ntimes. . . .  No, no, reflection assured him, to call her beautiful\nwould be, and must always have been, an exaggeration; but to deny the\nexotic and somewhat sinister charm of her, even to-day, would be an\nabsurdity.\n\nShe said, abruptly:  \"I do not think I ever loved you as women love\nmen.  You were too anxious to associate with fine folk, too eager to\nsecure a patron--yes, and to get your profit of him--and you were\nalways ill-at-ease among us.  Our youth is so long past, and we two are\nso altered that we, I think, may speak of its happenings now without\nany bitterness.  I hated those sordid, petty traits.  I raged at your\nincessant pretensions to gentility because I knew you to be so much\nmore than a gentleman.  Oh, it infuriated me--how long ago it was!--to\nsee you cringing to the Court blockheads, and running their errands,\nand smirkingly pocketing their money, and wheedling them into helping\nthe new play to success.  You complained I treated you like a lackey;\nit was not unnatural when of your own freewill you played the lackey so\nassiduously.\"\n\nHe laughed.  He had anatomized himself too frequently and with too much\ndispassion to overlook whatever tang of snobbishness might be in him;\nand, moreover, the charge thus tendered became in reality the speaker's\napology, and hurt nobody's self-esteem.\n\n\"Faith, I do not say you are altogether in the wrong,\" he assented.\n\"They could be very useful to me--Pembroke, and Southampton, and those\nothers--and so I endeavored to render my intimacy acceptable.  It was\nmy business as a poet to make my play as near perfect as I could; and\nthis attended to, common-sense demanded of the theater-manager that he\nderive as much money as was possible from its representation.  What\nwould you have?  The man of letters, like the carpenter or the\nblacksmith, must live by the vending of his productions, not by the\neating of them.\" The woman waved this aside.\n\nShe paced the grass in meditation, the peach leaves brushing her proud\nhead--caressingly, it seemed to him.  Later she came nearer in a\nbrand-new mood.  She smiled now, and her voice was musical and thrilled\nwith wonder.  \"But what a poet Heaven had locked inside this little\nparasite!  It used to puzzle me.\"  She laughed, and ever so lightly.\n\"Eh, and did you never understand why by preference I talked with you\nat evening from my balcony?  It was because I could forget you then\nentirely.  There was only a voice in the dark.  There was a sorcerer at\nwhose bidding words trooped like a conclave of emperors, and now sang\nlike a bevy of linnets.  And wit and fancy and high aspirations and my\nlove--because I knew then that your love for me was splendid and\ndivine--these also were my sorcerer's potent allies.  I understood then\nhow glad and awed were those fabulous Greekish queens when a god wooed\nthem.  Yes, then I understood.  How long ago it seems!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he sighed.  \"In that full-blooded season was Guenevere a\nlass, I think, and Charlemagne was not yet in breeches.\"\n\n\"And when there was a new play enacted I was glad.  For it was our play\nthat you and I had polished the last line of yesterday, and all these\npeople wept and laughed because of what we had done.  And I was\nproud----\"  The lady shrugged impatiently.  \"Proud, did I say? and\nglad?  That attests how woefully I fall short of you, my poet.  You\nwould have found some magic phrase to make that ancient glory\narticulate, I know.  Yet,--did I ever love you?  I do not know that.  I\nonly know I sometimes fear you robbed me of the power of loving any\nother man.\"\n\nHe raised one hand in deprecation.  \"I must remind you,\" he cried,\nwhimsically, \"that a burnt child dreads even to talk of fire.\"\n\nHer response was a friendly nod.  She came yet nearer.  \"What,\" she\ndemanded, and her smile was elfish, \"what if I had lied to you?  What\nif I were hideously tired of my husband, that bluff, stolid captain?\nWhat if I wanted you to plead with me as in the old time?\"\n\nHe said:  \"Until now you were only a woman.  Oh, and now, my dear, you\nare again that resistless gipsy who so merrily beguiled me to the very\nheart of loss.  You are Love.  You are Youth.  You are Comprehension.\nYou are all that I have had, and lost, and vainly hunger for.  Here in\nthis abominable village, there is no one who understands--not even\nthose who are more dear to me than you are.  I know.  I only spoil good\npaper which might otherwise be profitably used to wrap herrings in,\nthey think.  They give me ink and a pen just as they would give toys to\na child who squalled for them too obstinately.  And Poesy is a thrifty\noracle with no words to waste upon the deaf, however loudly her\ninterpreter cry out to her.  Oh, I have hungered for you, my proud,\ndark lady!\" the playmaker said.\n\nAfterward they stood quite silent.  She was not unmoved by his outcry;\nand for this very reason was obscurely vexed by the reflection that it\nwould be the essay of a braver man to remedy, rather than to lament,\nhis circumstances.  And then the moment's rapture failed him.\n\n\"I am a sorry fool,\" he said; and lightly he ran on:  \"You are a\nskilful witch.  Yet you have raised the ghost of an old madness to no\npurpose.  You seek a master-poet?  You will find none here.  Perhaps I\nwas one once.  But most of us are poets of one sort or another when we\nlove.  Do you not understand?  To-day I do not love you any more than I\ndo Hecuba.  Is it not strange that I should tell you this and not be\nmoved at all?  Is it not laughable that we should stand here at the\nlast, two feet apart as things physical go, and be as profoundly\nsevered as if an ocean tumbled between us?\"\n\nHe fell to walking to and fro, his hands behind his back.  She waited,\nused as she was to his unstable temperament, a trifle puzzled.\nPresently he spoke:\n\n\"There was a time when a master-poet was needed.  He was\nfound--nay,--rather made.  Fate hastily caught up a man not very\ndifferent from the run of men--one with a taste for stringing phrases\nand with a comedy or so to his discredit.  Fate merely bid him love a\nheadstrong child newly released from the nursery.\"\n\n\"We know her well enough,\" she said.  \"The girl was faithless, and\ntyrannous, and proud, and coquettish, and unworthy, and false, and\ninconstant.  She was black as hell and dark as night in both her person\nand her living.  You were not niggardly of vituperation.\"\n\nAnd he grimaced.  \"Faith,\" he replied, \"but sonnets are a more natural\nform of expression than affidavits, and they are made effective by\ncompliance with different rules.  I find no flagrant fault with you\nto-day.  You were a child of seventeen, the darling of a noble house,\nand an actor--yes, and not even a pre-eminent actor--a gross, poor\nposturing vagabond, just twice your age, presumed to love you.  What\nchild would not amuse herself with such engaging toys?  Vivacity and\nprettiness and cruelty are the ordinary attributes of kittenhood.  So\nyou amused yourself.  And I submitted with clear eyes, because I could\nnot help it.  Yes, I who am by nature not disposed to underestimate my\npersonal importance--I submitted, because your mockery was more\ndesirable than the adoration of any other woman.  And all this helped\nto make a master-poet of me.  Eh, why not, when such monstrous passions\nspoke through me--as if some implacable god elected to play godlike\nmusic on a mountebank's lute?  And I made admirable plays.  Why not,\nwhen there was no tragedy more poignant than mine?--and where in any\ncomedy was any figure one-half so ludicrous as mine?  Ah, yes, Fate\ngained her ends, as always.\"\n\nHe was a paunchy, inconsiderable little man.  By ordinary his elongated\nfeatures and high, bald forehead loaned him an aspect of serene and\naxiom-based wisdom, much as we see him in his portraits; but now his\ncountenance was flushed and mobile.  Odd passions played about it, as\nwhen on a sullen night in August summer lightnings flicker and merge.\n\nHis voice had found another cadence.  \"But Fate was not entirely\nruthless.  Fate bade the child become a woman, and so grow tired of all\nher childhood's playthings.  This was after a long while, as we\nestimate happenings. . . .  I suffered then.  Yes, I went down to the\ndoors of death, as people say, in my long illness.  But that crude,\ncorporal fever had a providential thievishness; and not content with\nstripping me of health and strength,--not satisfied with pilfering\ninventiveness and any strong hunger to create--why, that insatiable\nfever even robbed me of my insanity.  I lived.  I was only a broken\ninstrument flung by because the god had wearied of playing.  I would\ngive forth no more heart-wringing music, for the musician had departed.\nAnd I still lived--I, the stout little tradesman whom you loathed.\nYes, that tradesman scrambled through these evils, somehow, and came\nout still able to word adequately all such imaginings as could be\ndevised by his natural abilities.  But he transmitted no more\nheart-wringing music.\"\n\nShe said, \"You lie!\"\n\nHe said, \"I thank Heaven daily that I do not.\"  He spoke the truth.\nShe knew it, and her heart was all rebellion.\n\nIndefatigable birds sang through the following hush.  A wholesome and\ntemperate breeze caressed these silent people.  Bees that would die\nto-morrow hummed about them tirelessly.\n\nThen the poet said:  \"I loved you; and you did not love me.  It is the\nmost commonplace of tragedies, the heart of every man alive has been\nwounded in this identical fashion.  A master-poet is only that wounded\nman--among so many other bleeding folk--who perversely augments his\nagony, and utilizes his wound as an inkwell.  Presently time scars over\nthe cut for him, as time does for all the others.  He does not suffer\nany longer.  No, and such relief is a clear gain; but none the less, he\nmust henceforward write with ordinary ink such as the lawyers use.\"\n\n\"I should have been the man,\" the woman cried.  \"Had I been sure of\nfame, could I have known those raptures when you used to gabble\nimmortal phrases like a stammering infant, I would have paid the price\nwithout all this whimpering.\"\n\n\"Faith, and I think you would have,\" he assented.  \"There is the\ndifference.  At bottom I am a creature of the most moderate\naspirations, as you always complained; and for my part, Fate must in\nreason demand her applause of posterity rather than of me.  For I\nregret the unlived life that I was meant for--the comfortable level\nlife of little happenings which all my schoolfellows have passed\nthrough in a stolid drove.  I was equipped to live that life with\nrelish, and that life only; and it was denied me.  It was demolished in\norder that a book or two be made out of its wreckage.\"\n\nShe said, with half-shut eyes:  \"There is a woman at the root of all\nthis.\"  And how he laughed!\n\n\"Did I not say you were a witch?  Why, most assuredly there is.\"\n\nHe motioned with his left hand.  Some hundred yards away a young man,\nwho was carrying two logs toward New Place, had paused to rest.  A girl\nwas with him.  Now laughingly she was pretending to assist the porter\nin lifting his burden.  It was a quaintly pretty vignette, as framed by\nthe peach leaves, because those two young people were so merry and so\ncandidly in love.  A symbolist might have wrung pathos out of the\ngirl's desire to aid, as set against her fond inadequacy; and the\nattendant playwright made note of it.\n\n\"Well, well!\" he said:  \"Young Quiney is a so-so choice, since women\nmust necessarily condescend to intermarrying with men.  But he is far\nfrom worthy of her.  Tell me, now, was there ever a rarer piece of\nbeauty?\"\n\n\"The wench is not ill-favored,\" was the dark lady's unenthusiastic\nanswer.  \"So!--but who is she?\"\n\nHe replied:  \"She is my daughter.  Yonder you see my latter muse for\nwhose dear sake I spin romances.  I do not mean that she takes any\nlively interest in them.  That is not to be expected, since she cannot\nread or write.  Ask her about the poet we were discussing, and I very\nmuch fear Judith will bluntly inform you she cannot tell a B from a\nbull's foot.  But one must have a muse of some sort or another; and so\nI write about the world now as Judith sees it.  My Judith finds this\nworld an eminently pleasant place.  It is full of laughter and\nkindliness--for could Herod be unkind to her?--and it is largely\npopulated by ardent young fellows who are intended chiefly to be\ntwisted about your fingers; and it is illuminated by sunlight whose\nreal purpose is to show how pretty your hair is.  And if affairs go\nbadly for a while, and you have done nothing very wrong--why, of\ncourse, Heaven will soon straighten matters satisfactorily.  For\nnothing that happens to us can possibly be anything except a benefit,\nbecause God orders all happenings, and God loves us.  There you have\nJudith's creed; and upon my word, I believe there is a great deal to be\nsaid for it.\"\n\n\"And this is you,\" she cried--\"you who wrote of Troilus and Timon!\"\n\n\"I lived all that,\" he replied--\"I lived it, and so for a long while I\nbelieved in the existence of wickedness.  To-day I have lost many\nillusions, madam, and that ranks among them.  I never knew a wicked\nperson.  I question if anybody ever did.  Undoubtedly short-sighted\npeople exist who have floundered into ill-doing; but it proves always\nto have been on account of either cowardice or folly, and never because\nof malevolence; and, in consequence, their sorry pickle should demand\ncommiseration far more loudly than our blame.  In short, I find\nhumanity to be both a weaker and a better-meaning race than I had\nsuspected.  And so, I make what you call 'sugar-candy dolls,' because I\nvery potently believe that all of us are sweet at heart.  Oh no! men\nlack an innate aptitude for sinning; and at worst, we frenziedly\nattempt our misdemeanors just as a sheep retaliates on its pursuers.\nThis much, at least, has Judith taught me.\"\n\nThe woman murmured:  \"Eh, you are luckier than I.  I had a son.  He was\nborne of my anguish, he was fed and tended by me, and he was dependent\non me in all things.\"  She said, with a half-sob, \"My poet, he was so\nlittle and so helpless!  Now he is dead.\"\n\n\"My dear, my dear!\" he cried, and he took both her hands.  \"I also had\na son.  He would have been a man by this.\"\n\nThey stood thus for a while.  And then he smiled.\n\n\"I ask your pardon.  I had forgotten that you hate to touch my hands.\nI know--they are too moist and flabby.  I always knew that you thought\nthat.  Well!  Hamnet died.  I grieved.  That is a trivial thing to say.\nBut you also have seen your own flesh lying in a coffin so small that\neven my soft hands could lift it.  So you will comprehend.  To-day I\nfind that the roughest winds abate with time.  Hatred and self-seeking\nand mischance and, above all, the frailties innate in us--these buffet\nus for a while, and we are puzzled, and we demand of God, as Job did,\nwhy is this permitted?  And then as the hair dwindles, the wit grows.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, with age we take a slackening hold upon events; we let all\nhappenings go by more lightly; and we even concede the universe not to\nbe under any actual bond to be intelligible.  Yes, that is true.  But\nis it gain, my poet? for I had thought it to be loss.\"\n\n\"With age we gain the priceless certainty that sorrow and injustice are\nephemeral.  Solvitur ambulando, my dear.  I have attested this merely\nby living long enough.  I, like any other man of my years, have in my\nday known more or less every grief which the world breeds; and each\nmaddened me in turn, as each was duly salved by time; so that to-day\ntheir ravages vex me no more than do the bee-stings I got when I was an\nurchin.  To-day I grant the world to be composed of muck and sunshine\nintermingled; but, upon the whole, I find the sunshine more pleasant to\nlook at, and--greedily, because my time for sightseeing is not very\nlong--I stare at it.  And I hold Judith's creed to be the best of all\nimaginable creeds--that if we do nothing very wrong, all human\nimbroglios, in some irrational and quite incomprehensible fashion, will\nbe straightened to our satisfaction.  Meanwhile, you also voice a tonic\ntruth--this universe of ours, and, reverently speaking, the Maker of\nthis universe as well, is under no actual bond to be intelligible in\ndealing with us.\"  He laughed at this season and fell into a lighter\ntone.  \"Do I preach like a little conventicle-attending tradesman?\nFaith, you must remember that when I talk gravely Judith listens as if\nit were an oracle discoursing.  For Judith loves me as the wisest and\nthe best of men.  I protest her adoration frightens me.  What if she\nwere to find me out?\"\n\n\"I loved what was divine in you,\" the woman answered.\n\n\"Oddly enough, that is the perfect truth!  And when what was divine in\nme had burned a sufficiency of incense to your vanity, your vanity's\nowner drove off in a fine coach and left me to die in a garret.  Then\nJudith came.  Then Judith nursed and tended and caressed me--and Judith\nonly in all the world!--as once you did that boy you spoke of.  Ah,\nmadam, and does not sorrow sometimes lie awake o' nights in the low\ncradle of that child? and sometimes walk with you by day and clasp your\nhand--much as his tiny hand did once, so trustingly, so like the\nclutching of a vine--and beg you never to be friends with anything save\nsorrow?  And do you wholeheartedly love those other women's boys--who\ndid not die?  Yes, I remember.  Judith, too, remembered.  I was her\nfather, for all that I had forsaken my family to dance Jack-pudding\nattendance on a fine Court lady.  So Judith came.  And Judith, who sees\nin play-writing just a very uncertain way of making money--Judith, who\ncannot tell a B from a bull's foot,--why, Judith, madam, did not ask,\nbut gave, what was divine.\"\n\n\"You are unfair,\" she cried.  \"Oh, you are cruel, you juggle words,\nmake knives of them. . . .  You\" and she spoke as with difficulty--\"you\nhave no right to know just how I loved my boy!  You should be either\nman or woman!\"\n\nHe said pensively:  \"Yes, I am cruel.  But you had mirth and beauty\nonce, and I had only love and a vocabulary.  Who then more flagrantly\nabused the gifts God gave?  And why should I not be cruel to you, who\nmade a master-poet of me for your recreation?  Lord, what a deal of\nruined life it takes to make a little art!  Yes, yes, I know.  Under\nold oaks lovers will mouth my verses, and the acorns are not yet shaped\nfrom which those oaks will spring.  My adoration and your perfidy, all\nthat I have suffered, all that I have failed in even, has gone toward\nthe building of an enduring monument.  All these will be immortal,\nbecause youth is immortal, and youth delights in demanding explanations\nof infinity.  And only to this end I have suffered and have catalogued\nthe ravings of a perverse disease which has robbed my life of all the\nnormal privileges of life as flame shrivels hair from the arm--that\nyoung fools such as I was once might be pleased to murder my rhetoric,\nand scribblers parody me in their fictions, and schoolboys guess at the\ndate of my death!\"  This he said with more than ordinary animation; and\nthen he shook his head.  \"There is a leaven,\" he said--\"there is a\nleaven even in your smuggest and most inconsiderable tradesman.\"\n\nShe answered, with a wistful smile:  \"I, too, regret my poet.  And just\nnow you are more like him----\"\n\n\"Faith, but he was really a poet--or, at least, at times----?\"\n\n\"Not marble, nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this\npowerful rhyme----'\"\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" he said, in petulant vexation; \"how horribly emotion\nbotches verse.  That clash of sibilants is both harsh and\nungrammatical.  _Shall_ should be changed to _will_.\"  And at that the\nwoman sighed, because, in common with all persons who never essayed\ncreative verbal composition, she was quite certain perdurable writing\nmust spring from a surcharged heart, rather than from a rearrangement\nof phrases.  And so,\n\n\"Very unfeignedly I regret my poet,\" she said, \"my poet, who was\nunhappy and unreasonable, because I was not always wise or kind, or\neven just.  And I did not know until to-day how much I loved my\npoet. . . .  Yes, I know now I loved him.  I must go now.  I would I\nhad not come.\"\n\nThen, standing face to face, he cried, \"Eh, madam, and what if I also\nhave lied to you--in part?  Our work is done; what more is there to\nsay?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered--\"nothing.  Not even for you, who are a\nmaster-smith of words to-day and nothing more.\"\n\n\"I?\" he replied.  \"Do you so little emulate a higher example that even\nfor a moment you consider me?\"\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\nWhen she had gone, the playmaker sat for a long while in meditation;\nand then smilingly he took up his pen.  He was bound for \"an\nuninhabited island\" where all disasters ended in a happy climax.\n\n\"So, so!\" he was declaiming, later on: \"_We, too, are kin To dreams and\nvisions; and our little life Is gilded by such faint and cloud-wrapped\nsuns_--Only, that needs a homelier touch.  Rather, let us say, _We are\nsuch stuff As dreams are made on_--Oh, good, good!--Now to pad out the\nline. . . .  In any event, the Bermudas are a seasonable topic.  Now\nhere, instead of _thickly-templed India_, suppose we write _the\nstill-vexed Bermoothes_--Good, good!  It fits in well enough. . . .\"\n\nAnd so in clerkly fashion he sat about the accomplishment of his stint\nof labor in time for dinner.  A competent workman is not disastrously\nupset by interruption; and, indeed, he found the notion of surprising\nJudith with an unlooked-for trinket or so to be at first a very\nefficacious spur to composition.\n\nAnd presently the strong joy of creating kindled in him, and phrase\nflowed abreast with thought, and the playmaker wrote fluently and\nsurely to an accompaniment of contented ejaculations.  He regretted\nnothing, he would not now have laid aside his pen to take up a scepter.\nFor surely--he would have said--to live untroubled, and weave beautiful\nand winsome dreams is the most desirable of human fates.  But he did\nnot consciously think of this, because he was midcourse in the evoking\nof a mimic tempest which, having purged its victims of unkindliness and\nerror, aimed (in the end) only to sink into an amiable calm.\n\n\n\n\nCONCERNING CORINNA\n\n\n\"_Dr. Herrick told me that, in common with all the Enlightened or\nIlluminated Brothers, of which prying sect the age breeds so many, he\ntrusted the great lines of Nature, not in the whole, but in part, as\nthey believed Nature was in certain senses not true, and a betrayer,\nand that she was not wholly the benevolent power to endow, as accorded\nwith the prevailing deceived notion of the vulgar.  But he wished not\nto discuss more particularly than thus, as he had drawn up to himself a\ncertain frontier of reticence; and so fell to petting a great black\npig, of which he made an unseemly companion, and to talking idly._\"\n\n\n  A Gyges ring they bear about them still,\n  To be, and not, seen when and where they will;\n\n  They tread on clouds, and though they sometimes fall,\n  They fall like dew, and make no noise at all:\n\n  So silently they one to th' other come\n  As colors steal into the pear or plum;\n\n  And air-like, leave no pression to be seen\n  Where'er they met, or parting place has been.\n\n  ROBERT HERRICK.--_My Lovers how They Come and Part_.\n\n\n\n\nCONCERNING CORINNA\n\n\nThe matter hinges entirely upon whether or not Robert Herrick was\ninsane.  Sir Thomas Browne always preferred to think that he was;\nwhereas Philip Borsdale perversely considered the answer to be\noptional.  Perversely, Sir Thomas protested, because he said that to\nbelieve in Herrick's sanity was not conducive to your own.\n\nThis much is certain: the old clergyman, a man of few friends and no\nintimates, enjoyed in Devon, thanks to his time-hallowed reputation for\nsingularity, a certain immunity.  In and about Dean Prior, for\ninstance, it was conceded in 1674 that it was unusual for a divine of\nthe Church of England to make a black pig--and a pig of peculiarly\ndiabolical ugliness, at that--his ordinary associate; but Dean Prior\nhad come long ago to accept the grisly brute as a concomitant of Dr.\nHerrick's presence almost as inevitable as his shadow. It was no crime\nto be fond of dumb animals, not even of one so inordinately\nunprepossessing; and you allowed for eccentricities, in any event, in\ndealing with a poet.\n\nFor Totnes, Buckfastleigh, Dean Prior--all that part of Devon, in\nfact--complacently basked in the reflected glory of Robert Herrick.\nPeople came from a long distance, now that the Parliamentary Wars were\nover, in order just to see the writer of the _Hesperides_ and the\n_Noble Numbers_.  And such enthusiasts found in Robert Herrick a\nhideous dreamy man, who, without ever perpetrating any actual\ndiscourtesy, always managed to dismiss them, somehow, with a sense of\nhaving been rebuffed.\n\nSir Thomas Browne, that ardent amateur of the curious, came into Devon,\nhowever, without the risk of incurring any such fate, inasmuch as the\nknight traveled westward simply to discuss with Master Philip Borsdale\nthe recent doings of Cardinal Alioneri.  Now, Philip Borsdale, as Sir\nThomas knew, had been employed by Herrick in various transactions here\nirrelevant.  In consequence, Sir Thomas Browne was not greatly\nsurprised when, on his arrival at Buckfastleigh, Borsdale's\nbody-servant told him that Master Borsdale had left instructions for\nSir Thomas to follow him to Dean Prior.  Browne complied, because his\nbusiness with Borsdale was of importance.\n\nPhilip Borsdale was lounging in Dr. Herrick's chair, intent upon a\nlengthy manuscript, alone and to all appearances quite at home.  The\nstate of the room Sir Thomas found extraordinary; but he had graver\nmatters to discuss; and he explained the results of his mission without\nextraneous comment.\n\n\"Yes, you have managed it to admiration,\" said Philip Borsdale, when\nthe knight had made an end.  Borsdale leaned back and laughed,\npurringly, for the outcome of this affair of the Cardinal and the Wax\nImage meant much to him from a pecuniary standpoint.  \"Yet it is odd a\nprince of any church which has done so much toward the discomfiture of\nsorcery should have entertained such ideas.  It is also odd to note the\nseries of coincidences which appears to have attended this Alioneri's\npractises.\"\n\n\"I noticed that,\" said Sir Thomas.  After a while he said:  \"You think,\nthen, that they must have been coincidences?\"\n\n\"MUST is a word which intelligent people do not outwear by too constant\nusage.\"\n\nAnd \"Oh----?\" said the knight, and said that alone, because he was\nfamiliar with the sparkle now in Borsdale's eyes, and knew it heralded\nan adventure for an amateur of the curious.\n\n\"I am not committing myself, mark you, Sir Thomas, to any statement\nwhatever, beyond the observation that these coincidences were\nnoticeable.  I add, with superficial irrelevance, that Dr. Herrick\ndisappeared last night.\"\n\n\"I am not surprised,\" said Sir Thomas, drily.  \"No possible antics\nwould astonish me on the part of that unvenerable madman.  When I was\nlast in Totnes, he broke down in the midst of a sermon, and flung the\nmanuscript of it at his congregation, and cursed them roundly for not\npaying closer attention.  Such was never my ideal of absolute decorum\nin the pulpit.  Moreover, it is unusual for a minister of the Church of\nEngland to be accompanied everywhere by a pig with whom he discusses\nthe affairs of the parish precisely as if the pig were a human being.\"\n\n\"The pig--he whimsically called the pig Corinna, sir, in honor of that\nimaginary mistress to whom he addressed so many verses--why, the pig\nalso has disappeared.  Oh, but of course that at least is simply a\ncoincidence. . . .  I grant you it was an uncanny beast.  And I grant\nyou that Dr. Herrick was a dubious ornament to his calling.  Of that I\nam doubly certain to-day,\" said Borsdale, and he waved his hand\ncomprehensively, \"in view of the state in which--you see--he left this\nroom.  Yes, he was quietly writing here at eleven o'clock last night\nwhen old Prudence Baldwin, his housekeeper, last saw him.  Afterward\nDr. Herrick appears to have diverted himself by taking away the mats\nand chalking geometrical designs upon the floor, as well as by burning\nsome sort of incense in this brasier.\"\n\n\"But such avocations, Philip, are not necessarily indicative of sanity.\nNo, it is not, upon the whole, an inevitable manner for an elderly\nparson to while away an evening.\"\n\n\"Oh, but that was only a part, sir.  He also left the clothes he was\nwearing--in a rather peculiarly constructed heap, as you can see.\nAmong them, by the way, I found this flattened and corroded bullet.\nThat puzzled me.  I think I understand it now.\"  Thus Borsdale, as he\ncomposedly smoked his churchwarden.  \"In short, the whole affair is as\nmysterious----\"\n\nHere Sir Thomas raised his hand.  \"Spare me the simile.  I detect a\nvista of curious perils such as infinitely outshines verbal brilliancy.\nYou need my aid in some insane attempt.\"  He considered.  He said: \"So!\nyou have been retained?\"\n\n\"I have been asked to help him.  Of course I did not know of what he\nmeant to try.  In short, Dr. Herrick left this manuscript, as well as\ncertain instructions for me.  The last are--well! unusual.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!  You hearten me.  I have long had my suspicions as to this\nHerrick, though. . . .  And what are we to do?\"\n\n\"I really cannot inform you, sir.  I doubt if I could explain in any\nworkaday English even what we will attempt to do,\" said Philip\nBorsdale.  \"I do say this: You believe the business which we have\nsettled, involving as it does the lives of thousands of men and women,\nto be of importance.  I swear to you that, as set against what we will\nessay, all we have done is trivial.  As pitted against the business we\nwill attempt to-night, our previous achievements are suggestive of the\nevolutions of two sand-fleas beside the ocean.  The prize at which this\nadventure aims is so stupendous that I cannot name it.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you must, Philip.  I am no more afraid of the local\nconstabulary than I am of the local notions as to what respectability\nentails.  I may confess, however, that I am afraid of wagering against\nunknown odds.\"\n\nBorsdale reflected.  Then he said, with deliberation:  \"Dr. Herrick's\nwas, when you come to think of it, an unusual life.  He is--or perhaps\nI ought to say he was--upward of eighty-three.  He has lived here for\nover a half-century, and during that time he has never attempted to\nmake either a friend or an enemy.  He was--indifferent, let us say.\nTalking to Dr. Herrick was, somehow, like talking to a man in a\nfog. . . .  Meanwhile, he wrote his verses to imaginary women--to\nCorinna and Julia, to Myrha, Electra and Perilla--those lovely, shadow\nwomen who never, in so far as we know, had any real existence----\"\n\nSir Thomas smiled.  \"Of course.  They are mere figments of the poet,\npegs to hang rhymes on.  And yet--let us go on.  I know that Herrick\nnever willingly so much as spoke with a woman.\"\n\n\"Not in so far as we know, I said.\"  And Borsdale paused.  \"Then, too,\nhe wrote such dainty, merry poems about the fairies.  Yes, it was all\nof fifty years ago that Dr. Herrick first appeared in print with his\n_Description of the King and Queen of the Fairies_.  The thought seems\nalways to have haunted him.\"\n\nThe knight's face changed, a little by a little.  \"I have long been an\namateur of the curious,\" he said, strangely quiet.  \"I do not think\nthat anything you may say will surprise me inordinately.\"\n\n\"He had found in every country in the world traditions of a race who\nwere human--yet more than human.  That is the most exact fashion in\nwhich I can express his beginnings.  On every side he found the notion\nof a race who can impinge on mortal life and partake of it--but always\nwithout exercising the last reach of their endowments.  Oh, the\ntradition exists everywhere, whether you call these occasional\ninterlopers fauns, fairies, gnomes, ondines, incubi, or demons.  They\ncould, according to these fables, temporarily restrict themselves into\nour life, just as a swimmer may elect to use only one arm--or, a more\nfitting comparison, become apparent to our human senses in the fashion\nof a cube which can obtrude only one of its six surfaces into a plane.\nYou follow me, of course, sir?--to the triangles and circles and\nhexagons this cube would seem to be an ordinary square.  Conceiving\nsuch a race to exist, we might talk with them, might jostle them in the\nstreets, might even intermarry with them, sir--and always see in them\nonly human beings, and solely because of our senses' limitations.\"\n\n\"I comprehend.  These are exactly the speculations that would appeal to\nan unbalanced mind--is that not your thought, Philip?\"\n\n\"Why, there is nothing particularly insane, Sir Thomas, in desiring to\nexplore in fields beyond those which our senses make perceptible.  It\nis very certain these fields exist; and the question of their extent I\ntake to be both interesting and important.\"\n\nThen Sir Thomas said:  \"Like any other rational man, I have\noccasionally thought of this endeavor at which you hint.  We exist--you\nand I and all the others--in what we glibly call the universe.  All\nthat we know of it is through what we entitle our five senses, which,\nwhen provoked to action, will cause a chemical change in a few ounces\nof spongy matter packed in our skulls.  There are no grounds for\nbelieving that this particular method of communication is adequate, or\neven that the agents which produce it are veracious.  Meanwhile, we are\nin touch with what exists through our five senses only.  It may be that\nthey lie to us.  There is, at least, no reason for assuming them to be\ninfallible.\"\n\n\"But reflection plows a deeper furrow, Sir Thomas.  Even in the\nexercise of any one of these five senses it is certain that we are\nexcelled by what we vaingloriously call the lower forms of life.  A dog\nhas powers of scent we cannot reach to, birds hear the crawling of a\nworm, insects distinguish those rays in the spectrum which lie beyond\nviolet and red, and are invisible to us; and snails and fish and\nants--perhaps all other living creatures, indeed--have senses which man\ndoes not share at all, and has no name for.  Granted that we human\nbeings alone possess the power of reasoning, the fact remains that we\ninvariably start with false premises, and always pass our judgments\nwhen biased at the best by incomplete reports of everything in the\nuniverse, and very possibly by reports which lie flat-footedly.\"\n\nYou saw that Browne was troubled.  Now he rose.  \"Nothing will come of\nthis.  I do not touch upon the desirability of conquering those fields\nat which we dare only to hint.  No, I am not afraid.  I dare assist you\nin doing anything Dr. Herrick asks, because I know that nothing will\ncome of such endeavors.  Much is permitted us--'but of the fruit of the\ntree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, to us who are\nno more than human, Ye shall not eat of it.'\"\n\n\"Yet Dr. Herrick, as many other men have done, thought otherwise.  I,\ntoo, will venture a quotation.  'Didst thou never see a lark in a cage?\nSuch is the soul in the body: this world is like her little turf of\ngrass, and the heavens o'er our heads, like her looking-glass, only\ngives us a miserable knowledge of the small compass of our prison.'\nMany years ago that lamentation was familiar.  What wonder, then, that\nDr. Herrick should have dared to repeat it yesterday?  And what wonder\nif he tried to free the prisoner?\"\n\n\"Such freedom is forbidden,\" Sir Thomas stubbornly replied.  \"I have\nlong known that Herrick was formerly in correspondence with John\nHeydon, and Robert Flood, and others of the Illuminated, as they call\nthemselves.  There are many of this sect in England, as we all know;\nand we hear much silly chatter of Elixirs and Philosopher's Stones in\nconnection with them.  But I happen to know somewhat of their real aims\nand tenets.  I do not care to know any more than I do.  If it be true\nthat all of which man is conscious is just a portion of a curtain, and\nthat the actual universe in nothing resembles our notion of it, I am\nwilling to believe this curtain was placed there for some righteous and\nwise reason.  They tell me the curtain may be lifted.  Whether this be\ntrue or no, I must for my own sanity's sake insist it can never be\nlifted.\"\n\n\"But what if it were not forbidden?  For Dr. Herrick asserts he has\nalready demonstrated that.\"\n\nSir Thomas interrupted, with odd quickness.  \"True, we must bear it in\nmind the man never married--Did he, by any chance, possess a crystal of\nVenice glass three inches square?\"\n\nAnd Borsdale gaped.  \"I found it with his manuscript.  But he said\nnothing of it. . . .  How could you guess?\"\n\nSir Thomas reflectively scraped the edge of the glass with his\nfinger-nail.  \"You would be none the happier for knowing, Philip.  Yes,\nthat is a blood-stain here.  I see.  And Herrick, so far as we know,\nhad never in his life loved any woman.  He is the only poet in history\nwho never demonstrably loved any woman.  I think you had better read me\nhis manuscript, Philip.\"\n\nThis Philip Borsdale did.\n\n\nThen Sir Thomas said, as quiet epilogue:  \"This, if it be true, would\nexplain much as to that lovely land of eternal spring and daffodils and\nfriendly girls, of which his verses make us free.  It would even\nexplain Corinna and Herrick's rapt living without any human ties.  For\nall poets since the time of AEschylus, who could not write until he was\ntoo drunken to walk, have been most readily seduced by whatever\nstimulus most tended to heighten their imaginings; so that for the sake\nof a song's perfection they have freely resorted to divers artificial\ninspirations, and very often without evincing any undue\nsqueamishness. . . .  I spoke of AEschylus.  I am sorry, Philip, that\nyou are not familiar with ancient Greek life.  There is so much I could\ntell you of, in that event, of the quaint cult of Kore, or Pherephatta,\nand of the swine of Eubouleus, and of certain ambiguous maidens, whom\nthose old Grecians fabled--oh, very ignorantly fabled, my lad, of\ncourse--to rule in a more quietly lit and more tranquil world than we\nblunder about.  I think I could explain much which now seems\nmysterious--yes, and the daffodils, also, that Herrick wrote of so\nconstantly.  But it is better not to talk of these sinister delusions\nof heathenry.\"  Sir Thomas shrugged.  \"For my reward would be to have\nyou think me mad.  I prefer to iterate the verdict of all logical\npeople, and formally to register my opinion that Robert Herrick was\nindisputably a lunatic.\"\n\nBorsdale did not seem perturbed.  \"I think the record of his\nexperiments is true, in any event.  You will concede that their results\nwere startling?  And what if his deductions be the truth? what if our\nlimited senses have reported to us so very little of the universe, and\neven that little untruthfully?\"  He laughed and drummed impatiently\nupon the table.  \"At least, he tells us that the boy returned.  I\nfervently believe that in this matter Dr. Herrick was capable of any\ncrime except falsehood.  Oh, no I depend on it, he also will return.\"\n\n\"You imagine Herrick will break down the door between this world and\nthat other inconceivable world which all of us have dreamed of!  To me,\nmy lad, it seems as if this Herrick aimed dangerously near to\nrepetition of the Primal Sin, for all that he handles it like a problem\nin mechanical mathematics.  The poet writes as if he were instructing a\ndame's school as to the advisability of becoming omnipotent.\"\n\n\"Well, well! I am not defending Dr. Herrick in anything save his desire\nto know the truth.  In this respect at least, he has proven himself to\nbe both admirable and fearless.  And at worst, he only strives to do\nwhat Jacob did at Peniel,\" said Philip Borsdale, lightly.  \"The\npatriarch, as I recall, was blessed for acting as he did.  The legend\nis not irrelevant, I think.\"\n\nThey passed into the adjoining room.\n\n\nThus the two men came into a high-ceiled apartment, cylindrical in\nshape, with plastered walls painted green everywhere save for the\nquaint embellishment of a large oval, wherein a woman, having an\neagle's beak, grasped in one hand a serpent and in the other a knife.\nSir Thomas Browne seemed to recognize this curious design, and gave an\nominous nod.\n\nBorsdale said:  \"You see Dr. Herrick had prepared everything.  And much\nof what we are about to do is merely symbolical, of course.  Most\npeople undervalue symbols.  They do not seem to understand that there\ncould never have been any conceivable need of inventing a periphrasis\nfor what did not exist.\"\n\nSir Thomas Browne regarded Borsdale for a while intently.  Then the\nknight gave his habitual shrugging gesture.  \"You are braver than I,\nPhilip, because you are more ignorant than I.  I have been too long an\namateur of the curious.  Sometimes in over-credulous moments I have\nalmost believed that in sober verity there are reasoning beings who are\nnot human--beings that for their own dark purposes seek union with us.\nIndeed, I went into Pomerania once to talk with John Dietrick of\nRamdin.  He told me one of those relations whose truth we dread, a tale\nwhich I did not dare, I tell you candidly, even to discuss in my\n_Vulgar Errors_.  Then there is Helgi Thorison's history, and that of\nLeonard of Basle also.  Oh, there are more recorded stories of this\nnature than you dream of, Philip.  We have only the choice between\nbelieving that all these men were madmen, and believing that ordinary\nhuman life is led by a drugged animal who drowses through a purblind\nexistence among merciful veils.  And these female creatures--these\nCorinnas, Perillas, Myrhas, and Electras--can it be possible that they\nare always striving, for their own strange ends, to rouse the sleeping\nanimal and break the kindly veils?--and are they permitted to use such\namiable enticements as Herrick describes?  Oh, no, all this is just a\nmadman's dream, dear lad, and we must not dare to consider it\nseriously, lest we become no more sane than he.\"\n\n\"But you will aid me?\" Borsdale said.\n\n\"Yes, I will aid you, Philip, for in Herrick's case I take it that the\nmischief is consummated already; and we, I think, risk nothing worse\nthan death.  But you will need another knife a little later--a knife\nthat will be clean.\"\n\n\"I had forgotten.\"  Borsdale withdrew, and presently returned with a\nbone-handled knife.  And then he made a light.  \"Are you quite ready,\nsir?\"\n\nSir Thomas Browne, that aging amateur of the curious, could not resist\na laugh.\n\nAnd then they sat about proceedings of which, for obvious reasons, the\ndetails are best left unrecorded.  It was not an unconscionable while\nbefore they seemed to be aware of unusual phenomena.  But as Sir Thomas\nalways pointed out, in subsequent discussions, these were quite\npossibly the fruitage of excited imagination.\n\n\"Now, Philip!--now, give me the knife!\" cried Sir Thomas Browne.  He\nknew for the first time, despite many previous mischancy happenings,\nwhat real terror was.\n\nThe room was thick with blinding smoke by this, so that Borsdale could\nsee nothing save his co-partner in this adventure.  Both men were\nshaken by what had occurred before.  Borsdale incuriously perceived\nthat old Sir Thomas rose, tense as a cat about to pounce, and that he\ncaught the unstained knife from Borsdale's hand, and flung it like a\njavelin into the vapor which encompassed them.  This gesture stirred\nthe smoke so that Borsdale could see the knife quiver and fall, and\nnote the tiny triangle of unbared plaster it had cut in the painted\nwoman's breast.  Within the same instant he had perceived a naked man\nwho staggered.\n\n\"_Iz adu kronyeshnago_----!\"  The intruder's thin, shrill wail was that\nof a frightened child.  The man strode forward, choked, seemed to grope\nhis way.  His face was not good to look at.  Horror gripped and tore at\nevery member of the cadaverous old body, as a high wind tugs at a flag.\nThe two witnesses of Herrick's agony did not stir during the instant\nwherein the frenzied man stooped, moving stiffly like an ill-made toy,\nand took up the knife.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I knew what he was about to do,\" said Sir Thomas Browne\nafterward, in his quiet fashion.  \"I did not try to stop him.  If\nHerrick had been my dearest friend, I would not have interfered.  I had\nseen his face, you comprehend.  Yes, it was kinder to let him die.  It\nwas curious, though, as he stood there hacking his chest, how at each\nstab he deliberately twisted the knife.  I suppose the pain distracted\nhis mind from what he was remembering.  I should have forewarned\nBorsdale of this possible outcome at the very first, I suppose.  But,\nthen, which one of us is always wise?\"\n\n\nSo this adventure came to nothing.  For its significance, if any,\nhinged upon Robert Herrick's sanity, which was at best a disputable\nquantity.  Grant him insane, and the whole business, as Sir Thomas was\nat large pains to point out, dwindles at once into the irresponsible\nvagaries of a madman.\n\n\"And all the while, for what we know, he had been hiding somewhere in\nthe house.  We never searched it.  Oh, yes, there is no doubt he was\ninsane,\" said Sir Thomas, comfortably.\n\n\"Faith! what he moaned was gibberish, of course----\"\n\n\"Oddly enough, his words were intelligible.  They meant in Russian 'Out\nof the lowest hell.'\"\n\n\"But, why, in God's name, Russian?\"\n\n\"I am sure I do not know,\" Sir Thomas replied; and he did not appear at\nall to regret his ignorance.\n\nBut Borsdale meditated, disappointedly.  \"Oh, yes, the outcome is\nambiguous, Sir Thomas, in every way.  I think we may safely take it as\na warning, in any event, that this world of ours, whatever its\ndeficiencies, was meant to be inhabited by men and women only.\"\n\n\n\"Now I,\" was Sir Thomas's verdict, \"prefer to take it as a warning that\ninsane people ought to be restrained.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, insanity is only one of the many forms of being abnormal.\nYes, I think it proves that all abnormal people ought to be restrained.\nPerhaps it proves that they are very potently restrained,\" said Philip\nBorsdale, perversely.\n\nPerversely, Sir Thomas always steadfastly protested, because he said\nthat to believe in Herrick's sanity was not conducive to your own.\n\nSo Sir Thomas shrugged, and went toward the open window.  Without the\nroad was a dazzling gray under the noon sun, for the sky was cloudless.\nThe ordered trees were rustling pleasantly, very brave in their\nautumnal liveries.  Under a maple across the way some seven laborers\nwere joking lazily as they ate their dinner.  A wagon lumbered by, the\ndriver whistling.  In front of the house a woman had stopped to\nrearrange the pink cap of the baby she was carrying.  The child had\njust reached up fat and uncertain little arms to kiss her.  Nothing\nthat Browne saw was out of ordinary, kindly human life.\n\n\"Well, after all,\" said Sir Thomas, upon a sudden, \"for one, I think it\nis an endurable world, just as it stands.\"\n\nAnd Borsdale looked up from a letter he had been reading.  It was from\na woman who has no concern with this tale, and its contents were of no\nimportance to any one save Borsdale.\n\n\"Now, do you know,\" said Philip Borsdale, \"I am beginning to think you\nthe most sensible man of my acquaintance!  Oh, yes, beyond doubt it is\nan endurable sun-nurtured world--just as it stands.  It makes it doubly\nodd that Dr. Herrick should have chosen always to\n\n  'Write of groves, and twilights, and to sing\n  The court of Mab, and of the Fairy King,\n  And write of Hell.'\"\n\n\nSir Thomas touched his arm, protestingly.  \"Ah, but you have forgotten\nwhat follows, Philip--\n\n  'I sing, and ever shall,\n  Of Heaven,--and hope to have it after all.'\"\n\n\n\"Well! I cry Amen,\" said Borsdale.  \"But I wish I could forget the old\nman's face.\"\n\n\"Oh, and I also,\" Sir Thomas said.  \"And I cry Amen with far more\nheartiness, my lad, because I, too, once dreamed of--of Corinna, shall\nwe say?\"\n\n\n\n\nOLIVIA'S POTTAGE\n\n\n\"_Mr. Wycherley was naturally modest until King Charles' court, that\nlate disgrace to our times, corrupted him.  He then gave himself up to\nall sorts of extravagances and to the wildest frolics that a wanton wit\ncould devise. . . .  Never was so much ill-nature in a pen as in his,\njoined with so much good nature as was in himself, even to excess; for\nhe was bountiful, even to run himself into difficulties, and charitable\neven to a fault.  It was not that he was free from the failings of\nhumanity, but he had the tenderness of it, too, which made everybody\nexcuse whom everybody loved; and even the asperity of his verses seems\nto have been forgiven._\"\n\n\n\n\n  I the Plain Dealer am to act to-day.\n\n        *     *     *     *     *     *\n\n  Now, you shrewd judges, who the boxes sway,\n  Leading the ladies' hearts and sense astray,\n  And for their sakes, see all and hear no play;\n  Correct your cravats, foretops, lock behind:\n  The dress and breeding of the play ne'er mind;\n  For the coarse dauber of the coming scenes\n  To follow life and nature only means,\n  Displays you as you are, makes his fine woman\n  A mercenary jilt and true to no man,\n  Shows men of wit and pleasure of the age\n  Are as dull rogues as ever cumber'd stage.\n\n  WILLIAM WYCHERLEY.--_Prologue to The Plain Dealer_.\n\n\n\n\nOLIVIA'S POTTAGE\n\n\nIt was in the May of 1680 that Mr. William Wycherley went into the\ncountry to marry the famed heiress, Mistress Araminta Vining, as he had\npreviously settled with her father, and found her to his vast relief a\nvery personable girl.  She had in consequence a host of admirers,\npre-eminent among whom was young Robert Minifie of Milanor.  Mr.\nWycherley, a noted stickler for etiquette, decorously made bold to\nquestion Mr. Minifie's taste in a dispute concerning waistcoats.  A\nduel was decorously arranged and these two met upon the narrow beach of\nTeviot Bay.\n\nTheirs was a spirited encounter, lasting for ten energetic minutes.\nThen Wycherley pinked Mr. Minifie in the shoulder, just as the\ndramatist, a favorite pupil of Gerard's, had planned to do; and the\nfour gentlemen parted with every imaginable courtesy, since the wounded\nman and the two seconds were to return by boat to Mr. Minifie's house\nat Milanor.\n\nMore lately Wycherley walked in the direction of Ouseley Manor,\nwhistling _Love's a Toy_.  Honor was satisfied, and, happily, as he\nreflected, at no expense of life.  He was a kindly hearted fop, and\nmore than once had killed his man with perfectly sincere regret.  But\nin putting on his coat--it was the black camlet coat with silver\nbuttons--he had overlooked his sleevelinks; and he did not recognize,\nfor twenty-four eventful hours, the full importance of his carelessness.\n\n\nIn the heart of Figgis Wood, the incomparable Countess of Drogheda,\naunt to Mr. Wycherley's betrothed, and a noted leader of fashion, had\npresently paused at sight of him--laughing a little--and with one tiny\nhand had made as though to thrust back the staghound which accompanied\nher.  \"Your humble servant, Mr. Swashbuckler,\" she said; and then: \"But\noh! you have not hurt the lad?\" she demanded, with a tincture of\nanxiety.\n\n\"Nay, after a short but brilliant engagement,\" Wycherley returned, \"Mr.\nMinifie was very harmlessly perforated; and in consequence I look to be\nmarried on Thursday, after all.\"\n\n\"Let me die but Cupid never meets with anything save inhospitality in\nthis gross world!\" cried Lady Drogheda.  \"For the boy is heels over\nhead in love with Araminta,--oh, a second Almanzor!  And my niece does\nnot precisely hate him either, let me tell you, William, for all your\nmonth's assault of essences and perfumed gloves and apricot paste and\nother small artillery of courtship.  La, my dear, was it only a month\nago we settled your future over a couple of Naples biscuit and a bottle\nof Rhenish?\" She walked beside him now, and the progress of these\nexquisites was leisurely.  There were many trees at hand so huge as to\nnecessitate a considerable detour.\n\n\"Egad, it is a month and three days over,\" Wycherley retorted, \"since\nyou suggested your respected brother-in-law was ready to pay my debts\nin full, upon condition I retaliated by making your adorable niece\nMistress Wycherley.  Well, I stand to-day indebted to him for an\nadvance of L1500 and am no more afraid of bailiffs.  We have performed\na very creditable stroke of business; and the day after to-morrow you\nwill have fairly earned your L500 for arranging the marriage.  Faith,\nand in earnest of this, I already begin to view you through appropriate\nlenses as undoubtedly the most desirable aunt in the universe.\"\n\nNor was there any unconscionable stretching of the phrase.  Through the\nquiet forest, untouched as yet by any fidgeting culture, and much as it\nwas when John Lackland wooed Hawisa under, its venerable oaks, old even\nthen, the little widow moved like a light flame.  She was clothed\nthroughout in scarlet, after her high-hearted style of dress, and\ncarried a tall staff of ebony; and the gold head of it was farther from\nthe dead leaves than was her mischievous countenance.  The big\nstaghound lounged beside her.  She pleased the eye, at least, did this\nheartless, merry and selfish Olivia, whom Wycherley had so ruthlessly\ndepicted in his _Plain Dealer_.  To the last detail Wycherley found\nher, as he phrased it, \"_mignonne et piquante_,\" and he told her so.\n\nLady Drogheda observed, \"Fiddle-de-dee!\"  Lady Drogheda continued:\n\"Yes, I am a fool, of course, but then I still remember Bessington, and\nthe boy that went mad there----\"\n\n\"Because of a surfeit of those dreams 'such as the poets know when they\nare young.'  Sweet chuck, beat not the bones of the buried; when he\nbreathed he was a likely lad,\" Mr. Wycherley declared, with signal\ngravity.\n\n\"Oh, la, la!\" she flouted him.  \"Well, in any event you were the first\ngentleman in England to wear a neckcloth of Flanders lace.\"\n\n\"And you were the first person of quality to eat cheesecakes in Spring\nGarden,\" he not half so mirthfully retorted.  \"So we have not entirely\nfailed in life, it may be, after all.\"\n\nShe made of him a quite irrelevant demand:  \"D'ye fancy Esau was\ncontented, William?\"\n\n\"I fancy he was fond of pottage, madam; and that, as I remember, he got\nhis pottage.  Come, now, a tangible bowl of pottage, piping hot, is not\nto be despised in such a hazardous world as ours is.\"\n\nShe was silent for a lengthy while.  \"Lord, Lord, how musty all that\nbrave, sweet nonsense seems!\" she said, and almost sighed.  \"Eh, well!\n_le vin est tir\u00e9, et il faut le boire_.\"\n\n\"My adorable aunt!  Let us put it a thought less dumpishly; and render\nthanks because our pottage smokes upon the table, and we are blessed\nwith excellent appetites.\"\n\n\"So that in a month we will be back again in the playhouses and Hyde\nPark and Mulberry Garden, or nodding to each other in the New\nExchange,--you with your debts paid, and I with my L500----?\"  She\npaused to pat the staghound's head.  \"Lord Remon came this afternoon,\"\nsaid Lady Drogheda, and with averted eyes.\n\n\"I do not approve of Remon,\" he announced.  \"Nay, madam, even a Siren\nought to spare her kin and show some mercy toward the more\nstagnant-blooded fish.\"\n\nAnd Lady Drogheda shrugged.  \"He is very wealthy, and I am lamentably\npoor.  One must not seek noon at fourteen o'clock or clamor for better\nbread than was ever made from wheat.\"\n\nMr. Wycherley laughed, after a pregnant silence.\n\n\"By heavens, madam, you are in the right!  So I shall walk no more in\nFiggis Wood, for its old magic breeds too many day-dreams.  Besides, we\nhave been serious for half-an-hour.  Now, then, let us discuss\ntheology, dear aunt, or millinery, or metaphysics, or the King's new\nstatue at Windsor, or, if you will, the last Spring Garden scandal.  Or\nlet us count the leaves upon this tree; and afterward I will enumerate\nmy reasons for believing yonder crescent moon to be the paring of the\nAngel Gabriel's left thumb-nail.\"\n\nShe was a woman of eloquent silences when there was any need of them;\nand thus the fop and the coquette traversed the remainder of that\nsolemn wood without any further speech.  Modish people would have\nesteemed them unwontedly glum.\n\n\nWycherley discovered in a while the absence of his sleeve-links, and\nwas properly vexed by the loss of these not unhandsome trinkets, the\ngifts of Lady Castlemaine in the old days when Mr. Wycherley was the\nKing's successful rival for her favors.  But Wycherley knew the tide\nfilled Teviot Bay and wondering fishes were at liberty to muzzle the\ntoys, by this, and merely shrugged at his mishap, midcourse in toilet.\n\nMr. Wycherley, upon mature deliberation, wore the green suit with\nyellow ribbons, since there was a ball that night in honor of his\nnearing marriage, and a confluence of gentry to attend it.  Miss Vining\nand he walked through a minuet to some applause; the two were heartily\nacclaimed a striking couple, and congratulations beat about their ears\nas thick as sugar-plums in a carnival.  And at nine you might have\nfound the handsome dramatist alone upon the East Terrace of Ouseley,\npacing to and fro in the moonlight, and complacently reflecting upon\nhis quite indisputable and, past doubt, unmerited good fortune.\n\nThere was never any night in June which nature planned the more\nadroitly.  Soft and warm and windless, lit by a vainglorious moon and\nevery star that ever shone, the beauty of this world caressed and\nheartened its beholder like a gallant music.  Our universe, Mr.\nWycherley conceded willingly, was excellent and kindly, and the Arbiter\nof it too generous; for here was he, the wastrel, like the third prince\nat the end of a fairy-tale, the master of a handsome wife, and a fine\nhouse and fortune.  Somewhere, he knew, young Minifie, with his arm in\na sling, was pleading with Mistress Araminta for the last time; and\nthis reflection did not greatly trouble Mr. Wycherley, since\nincommunicably it tickled his vanity.  He was chuckling when he came to\nthe open window.\n\nWithin a woman was singing, to the tinkling accompaniment of a spinet,\nfor the delectation of Lord Remon.  She was not uncomely, and the hard,\nlean, stingy countenance of the attendant nobleman was almost genial.\nWycherley understood with a great rending shock, as though the thought\nwere novel, that Olivia, Lady Drogheda, designed to marry this man, who\ngrinned within finger's reach--or, rather, to ally herself with Remon's\ninordinate wealth,--and without any heralding a brutal rage and hatred\nof all created things possessed the involuntary eavesdropper.\n\nShe looked up into Remon's face and, laughing with such bright and\nelfin mirth as never any other woman showed, thought Wycherley, she\nbroke into another song.  She would have spared Mr. Wycherley that had\nshe but known him to be within earshot. . . .  Oh, it was only Lady\nDrogheda who sang, he knew,--the seasoned gamester and coquette, the\nveteran of London and of Cheltenham,--but the woman had no right to\ncharm this haggler with a voice that was not hers.  For it was the\nvoice of another Olivia, who was not a fine and urban lady, and who\nlived nowhere any longer; it was the voice of a soft-handed, tender,\njeering girl, whom he alone remembered; and a sick, illimitable rage\ngrilled in each vein of him as liltingly she sang, for Remon, the old\nand foolish song which Wycherley had made in her praise very long ago,\nand of which he might not ever forget the most trivial word.\n\nMen, even beaux, are strangely constituted; and so it needed only\nthis--the sudden stark brute jealousy of one male animal for another.\nThat was the clumsy hand which now unlocked the dyke; and like a flood,\ntall and resistless, came the recollection of their far-off past and of\nits least dear trifle, of all the aspirations and absurdities and\nsplendors of their common youth, and found him in its path, a painted\nfellow, a spendthrift king of the mode, a most notable authority upon\nthe set of a peruke, a penniless, spent connoisseur of stockings,\nessences and cosmetics.\n\n\nHe got but little rest this night.\n\nThere were too many plaintive memories which tediously plucked him\nback, with feeble and innumerable hands, as often as he trod upon the\nthreshold of sleep.  Then too, there were so many dreams, half-waking,\nand not only of Olivia Chichele, naive and frank in divers rural\ncircumstances, but rather of Olivia, Lady Drogheda, that perfect piece\nof artifice; of how exquisite she was! how swift and volatile in every\nmovement! how airily indomitable, and how mendacious to the tips of her\npolished finger-nails!  and how she always seemed to flit about this\nworld as joyously, alertly, and as colorfully as some ornate and tiny\nbird of the tropics!\n\nBut presently parochial birds were wrangling underneath the dramatist's\nwindow, while he tossed and assured himself that he was sleepier than\nany saint who ever snored in Ephesus; and presently one hand of\nMoncrieff was drawing the bed-curtains, while the other carefully\nbalanced a mug of shaving-water.\n\n\nWycherley did not see her all that morning, for Lady Drogheda was\nfatigued, or so a lackey informed him, and as yet kept her chamber.\nHis Araminta he found deplorably sullen.  So the dramatist devoted the\nbetter part of this day to a refitting of his wedding-suit, just come\nfrom London; for Moncrieff, an invaluable man, had adjudged the pockets\nto be placed too high; and, be the punishment deserved or no, Mr.\nWycherley had never heard that any victim of law appeared the more\nadmirable upon his scaffold for being slovenly in his attire.\n\nThus it was as late as five in the afternoon that, wearing the\npeach-colored suit trimmed with scarlet ribbon, and a new French\nbeaver, the exquisite came upon Lady Drogheda walking in the gardens\nwith only an appropriate peacock for company.  She was so beautiful and\nbrilliant and so little--so like a famous gem too suddenly disclosed,\nand therefore oddly disparate in all these qualities, that his decorous\npleasant voice might quite permissibly have shaken a trifle (as indeed\nit did), when Mr. Wycherley implored Lady Drogheda to walk with him to\nTeviot Bay, on the off-chance of recovering his sleeve-links.\n\nAnd there they did find one of the trinkets, but the tide had swept\naway the other, or else the sand had buried it.  So they rested there\nupon the rocks, after an unavailing search, and talked of many trifles,\namid surroundings oddly incongruous.\n\nFor this Teviot Bay is a primeval place, a deep-cut, narrow notch in\nthe tip of Carnrick, and is walled by cliffs so high and so precipitous\nthat they exclude a view of anything except the ocean.  The bay opens\ndue west; and its white barriers were now developing a violet tinge,\nfor this was on a sullen afternoon, and the sea was ruffled by spiteful\ngusts.  Wycherley could find no color anywhere save in this glowing,\ntiny and exquisite woman; and everywhere was a gigantic peace, vexed\nonly when high overhead a sea-fowl jeered at these modish persons, as\nhe flapped toward an impregnable nest.\n\n\"And by this hour to-morrow,\" thought Mr. Wycherley, \"I shall be\nchained to that good, strapping, wholesome Juno of a girl!\"\n\nSo he fell presently into a silence, staring at the vacant west, which\nwas like a huge and sickly pearl, not thinking of anything at all, but\nlonging poignantly for something which was very beautiful and strange\nand quite unattainable, with precisely that anguish he had sometimes\nknown in awaking from a dream of which he could remember nothing save\nits piercing loveliness.\n\n\"And thus ends the last day of our bachelorhood!\" said Lady Drogheda,\nupon a sudden.  \"You have played long enough--La, William, you have led\nthe fashion for ten years, you have written four merry comedies, and\nyou have laughed as much as any man alive, but you have pulled down all\nthat nature raised in you, I think.  Was it worth while?\"\n\n\"Faith, but nature's monuments are no longer the last cry in\narchitecture,\" he replied; \"and I believe that _The Plain Dealer_ and\n_The Country Wife_ will hold their own.\"\n\n\"And you wrote them when you were just a boy!  Ah, yes, you might have\nbeen our English Moliere, my dear.  And, instead, you have elected to\nbecome an authority upon cravats and waistcoats.\"\n\n\"Eh, madam\"--he smiled--\"there was a time when I too was foolishly\nintent to divert the leisure hours of posterity.  But reflection\nassured me that posterity had, thus far, done very little to place me\nunder that or any other obligation.  Ah, no!  Youth, health and--though\nI say it--a modicum of intelligence are loaned to most of us for a\nwhile, and for a terribly brief while.  They are but loans, and Time is\nwaiting greedily to snatch them from us.  For the perturbed usurer\nknows that he is lending us, perforce, three priceless possessions, and\nthat till our lease runs out we are free to dispose of them as we\nelect.  Now, had I jealously devoted my allotment of these treasures\ntoward securing for my impressions of the universe a place in yet\nunprinted libraries, I would have made an investment from which I could\nnot possibly have derived any pleasure, and which would have been to\nother people of rather dubious benefit.  In consequence, I chose a\nwiser and devouter course.\"\n\nThis statement Lady Drogheda afforded the commentary of a grimace.\n\n\"Why, look you,\" Wycherley philosophized, \"have you never thought what\na vast deal of loving and painstaking labor must have gone to make the\nworld we inhabit so beautiful and so complete?  For it was not enough\nto evolve and set a glaring sun in heaven, to marshal the big stars\nabout the summer sky, but even in the least frequented meadow every\nbutterfly must have his pinions jeweled, very carefully, and every\nlovely blade of grass be fashioned separately.  The hand that yesterday\narranged the Himalayas found time to glaze the wings of a midge!  Now,\nmost of us could design a striking Flood, or even a Last judgment,\nsince the canvas is so big and the colors used so virulent; but to\npaint a snuff-box perfectly you must love the labor for its own sake,\nand pursue it without even an underthought of the performance's\nultimate appraisement.  People do not often consider the simple fact\nthat it is enough to bait, and quite superfluous to veneer, a  trap;\nindeed, those generally acclaimed the best of persons insist this world\nis but an antechamber, full of gins and pitfalls, which must be\nscurried through with shut eyes.  And the more fools they, as all we\npoets know! for to enjoy a sunset, or a glass of wine, or even to\nadmire the charms of a handsome woman, is to render the Artificer of\nall at least the tribute of appreciation.\"\n\nBut she said, in a sharp voice:  \"William, William----!\"  And he saw\nthat there was no beach now in Teviot Bay except the dwindling crescent\nat its farthest indentation on which they sat.\n\nYet his watch, on consultation, recorded only five o'clock; and\npresently Mr. Wycherley laughed, not very loudly.  The two had risen,\nand her face was a tiny snowdrift where every touch of rouge and\ngrease-pencils showed crudely.\n\n\"Look now,\" said Wycherley, \"upon what trifles our lives hinge!  Last\nnight I heard you singing, and the song brought back so many things\ndone long ago, and made me so unhappy that--ridiculous conclusion!--I\nforgot to wind my watch.  Well! the tide is buffeting at either side of\nCarnrick; within the hour this place will be submerged; and, in a\nphrase, we are as dead as Hannibal or Hector.\"\n\nShe said, very quiet:  \"Could you not gain the mainland if you stripped\nand swam for it?\"\n\n\"Why, possibly,\" the beau conceded.  \"Meanwhile you would have drowned.\nFaith, we had as well make the best of it.\"\n\nLittle Lady Drogheda touched his sleeve, and her hand (as the man\nnoted) did not shake at all, nor did her delicious piping voice shake\neither.  \"You cannot save me.  I know it.  I am not frightened.  I bid\nyou save yourself.\"\n\n\"Permit me to assist you to that ledge of rock,\" Mr. Wycherley\nanswered, \"which is a trifle higher than the beach; and I pray you,\nOlivia, do not mar the dignity of these last passages by talking\nnonsense.\"\n\nFor he had spied a ledge, not inaccessible, some four feet higher than\nthe sands, and it offered them at least a respite.  And within the\nmoment they had secured this niggardly concession, intent to die, as\nWycherley observed, like hurt mice upon a pantry-shelf.  The business\nsmacked of disproportion, he considered, although too well-bred to say\nas much; for here was a big ruthless league betwixt earth and sea, and\nwith no loftier end than to crush a fop and a coquette, whose speedier\nextinction had been dear at the expense of a shilling's worth of\narsenic!\n\nThen the sun came out, to peep at these trapped, comely people, and\ndoubtless to get appropriate mirth at the spectacle.  He hung low\nagainst the misty sky, a clearly-rounded orb that did not dazzle, but\nmerely shone with the cold glitter of new snow upon a fair December\nday; and for the rest, the rocks, and watery heavens, and all these\ntreacherous and lapping waves, were very like a crude draught of the\nworld, dashed off conceivably upon the day before creation.\n\nThese arbiters of social London did not speak at all; and the bleak\nwaters crowded toward them as in a fretful dispute of precedence.\n\nThen the woman said:  \"Last night Lord Remon asked me to marry him, and\nI declined the honor.  For this place is too like Bessington--and, I\nthink, the past month has changed everything----\"\n\n\"I thought you had forgotten Bessington,\" he said, \"long, long ago.\"\n\n\"I did not ever quite forget--Oh, the garish years,\" she wailed, \"since\nthen!  And how I hated you, William--and yet liked you, too,--because\nyou were never the boy that I remembered, and people would not let you\nbe!  And how I hated them--the huzzies!  For I had to see you almost\nevery day, and it was never you I saw--Ah, William, come back for just\na little, little while, and be an honest boy for just the moment that\nwe are dying, and not an elegant fine gentleman!\"\n\n\"Nay, my dear,\" the dramatist composedly answered, \"an hour of naked\ncandor is at hand.  Life is a masquerade where Death, it would appear,\nis master of the ceremonies.  Now he sounds his whistle; and we who\nwent about the world so long as harlequins must unmask, and for all\ntime put aside our abhorrence of the disheveled.  For in sober verity,\nthis is Death who comes, Olivia,--though I had thought that at his\nadvent one would be afraid.\"\n\nYet apprehension of this gross and unavoidable adventure, so soon to be\nendured, thrilled him, and none too lightly.  It seemed unfair that\ndeath should draw near thus sensibly, with never a twinge or ache to\nherald its arrival.  Why, there were fifty years of life in this fine,\nnimble body but for any contretemps like that of the deplorable\npresent!  Thus his meditations stumbled.\n\n\"Oh, William,\" Lady Drogheda bewailed, \"it is all so big--the incurious\nwest, and the sea, and these rocks that were old in Noah's youth,--and\nwe are so little----!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he returned, and took her hand, because their feet were wetted\nnow; \"the trap and its small prey are not commensurate.  The stage is\nset for a Homeric death-scene, and we two profane an over-ambitious\nbackground.  For who are we that Heaven should have rived the world\nbefore time was, to trap us, and should make of the old sea a\nfowling-net?\"  Their eyes encountered, and he said, with a strange gush\nof manliness:  \"Yet Heaven is kind.  I am bound even in honor now to\nmarry Mistress Araminta; and you would marry Remon in the end,\nOlivia,--ah, yes! for we are merely moths, my dear, and luxury is a\ndisastrously brilliant lamp.  But here are only you and I and the\nmaster of all ceremony.  And yet--I would we were a little worthier,\nOlivia!\"\n\n\"You have written four merry comedies and you were the first gentleman\nin England to wear a neckcloth of Flanders lace,\" she answered, and her\nsmile was sadder than weeping.\n\n\"And you were the first person of quality to eat cheese-cakes in Spring\nGarden.  There you have our epitaphs, if we in truth have earned an\nepitaph who have not ever lived.\"\n\n\"No, we have only laughed--Laugh now, for the last time, and hearten\nme, my handsome William!  And yet could I but come to God,\" the woman\nsaid, with a new voice, \"and make it clear to Him just how it all fell\nout, and beg for one more chance!  How heartily I would pray then!\"\n\n\"And I would cry Amen to all that prayer must of necessity contain,\" he\nanswered.  \"Oh!\" said Wycherley, \"just for applause and bodily comfort\nand the envy of innumerable other fools we two have bartered a great\nheritage!  I think our corner of the world will lament us for as much\nas a week; but I fear lest Heaven may not condescend to set apart the\nneedful time wherein to frame a suitable chastisement for such poor\nimbeciles.  Olivia, I have loved you all my life, and I have been\nfaithful neither to you nor to myself!  I love you so that I am not\nafraid even now, since you are here, and so entirely that I have\nforgotten how to plead my cause convincingly.  And I have had practice,\nlet me tell you. . . . !\"  Then he shook his head and smiled.  \"But\ncandor is not _\u00e0 la mode_.  See, now, to what outmoded and bucolic\nfrenzies nature brings even us at last.\"\n\nShe answered only, as she motioned seaward, \"Look!\"\n\n\nAnd what Mr. Wycherley saw was a substantial boat rowed by four of Mr.\nMinifie's attendants; and in the bow of the vessel sat that wounded\ngentleman himself, regarding Wycherley and Lady Drogheda with some\ndisfavor; and beside the younger man was Mistress Araminta Vining.\n\nIt was a perturbed Minifie who broke the silence.  \"This is very\nawkward,\" he said, \"because Araminta and I are eloping.  We mean to be\nmarried this same night at Milanor.  And deuce take it, Mr. Wycherley!\nI can't leave you there to drown, any more than in the circumstances I\ncan ask you to make one of the party.\"\n\n\"Mr.  Wycherley,\" said his companion, with far more asperity, \"the\nvanity and obduracy of a cruel father have forced me to the adoption of\nthis desperate measure.  Toward yourself I entertain no ill-feeling,\nnor indeed any sentiment at all except the most profound contempt.  My\naunt will, of course, accompany us; for yourself, you will do as you\nplease; but in any event I solemnly protest that I spurn your odious\npretensions, release myself hereby from an enforced and hideous\nobligation, and in a phrase would not marry you in order to be Queen of\nEngland.\"\n\n\"Miss Vining, I had hitherto admired you,\" the beau replied, with\nfervor, \"but now esteem is changed to adoration.\"\n\nThen he turned to his Olivia.  \"Madam, you will pardon the awkward but\nunavoidable publicity of my proceeding.  I am a ruined man.  I owe your\nbrother-in-law some L1500, and, oddly enough, I mean to pay him.  I\nmust sell Jephcot and Skene Minor, but while life lasts I shall keep\nBessington and all its memories.  Meanwhile there is a clergyman\nwaiting at Milanor.  So marry me to-night, Olivia; and we will go back\nto Bessington to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To Bessington----!\" she said.  It was as though she spoke of something\nvery sacred.  Then very musically Lady Drogheda laughed, and to the eye\nshe was all flippancy.  \"La, William, I can't bury myself in the\ncountry until the end of time,\" she said, \"and make interminable\ncustards,\" she added, \"and superintend the poultry,\" she said, \"and for\nrecreation play short whist with the vicar.\"\n\nAnd it seemed to Mr. Wycherley that he had gone divinely mad.  \"Don't\nlie to me, Olivia.  You are thinking there are yet a host of heiresses\nwho would be glad to be a famous beau's wife at however dear a cost.\nBut don't lie to me.  Don't even try to seem the airy and bedizened\nwoman I have known so long.  All that is over now.  Death tapped us on\nthe shoulder, and, if only for a moment, the masks were dropped.  And\nlife is changed now, oh, everything is changed!  Then, come, my dear!\nlet us be wise and very honest.  Let us concede it is still possible\nfor me to find another heiress, and for you to marry Remon; let us\ngrant it the only outcome of our common-sense! and for all that, laugh,\nand fling away the pottage, and be more wise than reason.\"\n\nShe irresolutely said:  \"I cannot.  Matters are altered now.  It would\nbe madness----\"\n\n\"It would undoubtedly be madness,\" Mr. Wycherley assented.  \"But then I\nam so tired of being rational!  Oh, Olivia,\" this former arbiter of\ntaste absurdly babbled, \"if I lose you now it is forever! and there is\nno health in me save when I am with you.  Then alone I wish to do\npraiseworthy things, to be all which the boy we know of should have\ngrown to. . . .  See how profoundly shameless I am become when, with\nsuch an audience, I take refuge in the pitiful base argument of my own\nweakness!  But, my dear, I want you so that nothing else in the world\nmeans anything to me.  I want you! and all my life I have wanted you.\"\n\n\"Boy, boy----!\" she answered, and her fine hands had come to Wycherley,\nas white birds flutter homeward.  But even then she had to deliberate\nthe matter--since the habits of many years are not put aside like\noutworn gloves,--and for innumerable centuries, it seemed to him, her\nfoot tapped on that wetted ledge.\n\nPresently her lashes lifted.  \"I suppose it would be lacking in\nreverence to keep a clergyman waiting longer than was absolutely\nnecessary?\" she hazarded.\n\n\n\n\nA BROWN WOMAN\n\n\n\"_A critical age called for symmetry, and exquisite finish had to be\nstudied as much as nobility of thought. . . .  POPE aimed to take first\nplace as a writer of polished verse.  Any knowledge he gained of the\nworld, or any suggestion that came to him from his intercourse with\nsociety, was utilized to accomplish his main purpose.  To put his\nthoughts into choice language was not enough.  Each idea had to be put\nin its neatest and most epigrammatic form._\"\n\n\n\n\n  Why did I write? what sin to me unknown\n  Dipt me in ink, my parents', or my own?\n  As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,\n  I lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.\n  The muse but served to ease some friend, not wife,\n  To help me through this long disease, my life.\n\n        *     *     *     *     *     *\n\n  Who shames a scribbler? break one cobweb through,\n  He spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew;\n  Destroy his fib or sophistry in vain,\n  The creature's at his foolish work again,\n  Throned in the centre of his thin designs,\n  Proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines!\n\n  ALEXANDER POPE.--_Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot_.\n\n\n\n\nA BROWN WOMAN\n\n\"But I must be hurrying home now,\" the girl said, \"for it is high time\nI were back in the hayfields.\"\n\n\"Fair shepherdess,\" he implored, \"for heaven's sake, let us not cut\nshort the _pastorelle_ thus abruptly.\"\n\n\"And what manner of beast may that be, pray?\"\n\n\"'Tis a conventional form of verse, my dear, which we at present\nstrikingly illustrate.  The plan of a _pastorelle_ is simplicity's\nself: a gentleman, which I may fairly claim to be, in some fair rural\nscene--such as this--comes suddenly upon a rustic maiden of surpassing\nbeauty.  He naturally falls in love with her, and they say all manner\nof fine things to each other.\"\n\nShe considered him for a while before speaking.  It thrilled him to see\nthe odd tenderness that was in her face.  \"You always think of saying\nand writing fine things, do you not, sir?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" he answered, gravely, \"I believe that I was undoubtedly\nguilty of such folly until you came.  I wish I could make you\nunderstand how your coming has changed everything.\"\n\n\"You can tell me some other time,\" the girl gaily declared, and was\nabout to leave him.\n\nHis hand detained her very gently.  \"Faith, but I fear not, for already\nmy old hallucinations seem to me incredible.  Why, yesterday I thought\nit the most desirable of human lots to be a great poet\"--the gentleman\nlaughed in self-mockery.  \"I positively did.  I labored every day\ntoward becoming one.  I lived among books, esteemed that I was doing\nsomething of genuine importance as I gravely tinkered with alliteration\nand metaphor and antithesis and judicious paraphrases of the ancients.\nI put up with life solely because it afforded material for\nversification; and, in reality, believed the destruction of Troy was\nprovidentially ordained lest Homer lack subject matter for an epic.\nAnd as for loving, I thought people fell in love in order to exchange\nwitty rhymes.\"\n\nHis hand detained her, very gently. . . .  Indeed, it seemed to him he\ncould never tire of noting her excellencies.  Perhaps it was that\nsplendid light poise of her head he chiefly loved; he thought so at\nleast, just now.  Or was it the wonder of her walk, which made all\nother women he had ever known appear to mince and hobble, like rusty\ntoys?  Something there was assuredly about this slim brown girl which\nrecalled an untamed and harmless woodland creature; and it was that, he\nknew, which most poignantly moved him, even though he could not name\nit.  Perhaps it was her bright kind eyes, which seemed to mirror the\ntranquillity of forests. . . .\n\n\"You gentry are always talking of love,\" she marveled.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, with acerbity, \"oh, I don't doubt that any number of\nbeef-gorging squires and leering, long-legged Oxford dandies----\"  He\nbroke off here, and laughed contemptuously.  \"Well, you are beautiful,\nand they have eyes as keen as mine.  And I do not blame you, my dear,\nfor believing my designs to be no more commendable than theirs--no, not\nat all.\"\n\nBut his mood was spoiled, and his tetchy vanity hurt, by the thought of\nstout well-set fellows having wooed this girl; and he permitted her to\ngo without protest.\n\nYet he sat alone for a while upon the fallen tree-trunk, humming a\ncontented little tune.  Never in his life had he been happier.  He did\nnot venture to suppose that any creature so adorable could love such a\nsickly hunchback, such a gargoyle of a man, as he was; but that Sarah\nwas fond of him, he knew.  There would be no trouble in arranging with\nher father for their marriage, most certainly; and he meant to attend\nto that matter this very morning, and within ten minutes.  So Mr.\nAlexander Pope was meanwhile arranging in his mind a suitable wording\nfor his declaration of marital aspirations.\n\nThus John Gay found him presently and roused him from phrase-spinning.\n\"And what shall we do this morning, Alexander?\"  Gay was always\ndemanding, like a spoiled child, to be amused.\n\nPope told him what his own plans were, speaking quite simply, but with\nhis countenance radiant.  Gay took off his hat and wiped his forehead,\nfor the day was warm.  He did not say anything at all.\n\n\"Well----?\" Mr. Pope asked, after a pause.\n\nMr. Gay was dubious.  \"I had never thought that you would marry,\" he\nsaid.  \"And--why, hang it, Alexander! to grow enamored of a milkmaid is\nwell enough for the hero of a poem, but in a poet it hints at\ninjudicious composition.\"\n\nMr. Pope gesticulated with thin hands and seemed upon the verge of\neloquence.  Then he spoke unanswerably.  \"But I love her,\" he said.\n\nJohn Gay's reply was a subdued whistle.  He, in common with the other\nguests of Lord Harcourt, at Nuneham Courtney, had wondered what would\nbe the outcome of Mr. Alexander Pope's intimacy with Sarah Drew.  A\nmonth earlier the poet had sprained his ankle upon Amshot Heath, and\nthis young woman had found him lying there, entirely helpless, as she\nreturned from her evening milking.  Being hale of person, she had\nmanaged to get the little hunchback to her home unaided.  And since\nthen Pope had often been seen with her.\n\nThis much was common knowledge.  That Mr. Pope proposed to marry the\nheroine of his misadventure afforded a fair mark for raillery, no\ndoubt, but Gay, in common with the run of educated England in 1718, did\nnot aspire to be facetious at Pope's expense.  The luxury was too\ncostly.  Offend the dwarf in any fashion, and were you the proudest\nduke at Court or the most inconsiderable rhymester in Petticoat Lane,\nit made no difference; there was no crime too heinous for \"the great\nMr. Pope's\" next verses to charge you with, and, worst of all, there\nwas no misdoing so out of character that his adroit malignancy could\nnot make it seem plausible.\n\nNow, after another pause, Pope said, \"I must be going now.  Will you\nnot wish me luck?\"\n\n\"Why, Alexander--why, hang it!\" was Mr. Gay's observation, \"I believe\nthat you are human after all, and not just a book in breeches.\"\n\n\nHe thereby voiced a commentary patently uncalled-for, as Mr. Pope\nafterward reflected.  Mr. Pope was then treading toward the home of old\nFrederick Drew.  It was a gray morning in late July.\n\n\"I love her,\" Pope had said.  The fact was undeniable; yet an\nexpression of it necessarily halts.  Pope knew, as every man must do\nwho dares conserve his energies to annotate the drama of life rather\nthan play a part in it, the nature of that loneliness which this\nconservation breeds.  Such persons may hope to win a posthumous esteem\nin the library, but it is at the bleak cost of making life a wistful\ntransaction with foreigners.  In such enforced aloofness Sarah Drew had\ncome to him--strong, beautiful, young, good and vital, all that he was\nnot--and had serenely befriended \"the great Mr. Pope,\" whom she viewed\nas a queer decrepit little gentleman of whom within a week she was\nunfeignedly fond.\n\n\"I love her,\" Pope had said.  Eh, yes, no doubt; and what, he fiercely\ndemanded of himself, was he--a crippled scribbler, a bungling artisan\nof phrases--that he should dare to love this splendid and deep-bosomed\ngoddess?  Something of youth awoke, possessing him--something of that\nhigh ardor which, as he cloudily remembered now, had once controlled a\nboy who dreamed in Windsor Forest and with the lightest of hearts\nplanned to achieve the impossible.  For what is more difficult of\nattainment than to achieve the perfected phrase, so worded that to\nalter a syllable of its wording would be little short of sacrilege?\n\n\"What whimwhams!\" decreed the great Mr. Pope, aloud.  \"Verse-making is\nat best only the affair of idle men who write in their closets and of\nidle men who read there.  And as for him who polishes phrases, whatever\nbe his fate in poetry, it is ten to one but he must give up all the\nreasonable aims of life for it.\"\n\nNo, he would have no more of loneliness.  Henceforward Alexander Pope\nwould be human--like the others.  To write perfectly was much; but it\nwas not everything.  Living was capable of furnishing even more than\nthe raw material of a couplet.  It might, for instance, yield content.\n\nFor instance, if you loved, and married, and begot, and died, with the\nseriousness of a person who believes he is performing an action of real\nimportance, and conceded that the perfection of any art, whether it be\nthat of verse-making or of rope-dancing, is at best a by-product of\nlife's conduct; at worst, you probably would not be lonely.  No; you\nwould be at one with all other fat-witted people, and there was no\ngreater blessing conceivable.\n\nPope muttered, and produced his notebook, and wrote tentatively.\n\nWrote Mr. Pope:\n\n  The bliss of man (could pride that blessing find)\n  Is not to act or think beyond mankind;\n  No powers of body or of soul to share\n  But what his nature and his state can bear.\n\n\n\"His state!\" yes, undeniably, two sibilants collided here.  \"His\nwit?\"--no, that would be flat-footed awkwardness in the management of\nyour vowel-sounds; the lengthened \"a\" was almost requisite. . . .  Pope\nwas fretting over the imbroglio when he absent-mindedly glanced up to\nperceive that his Sarah, not irrevocably offended, was being embraced\nby a certain John Hughes--who was a stalwart, florid personable\nindividual, no doubt, but, after all, only an unlettered farmer.\n\nThe dwarf gave a hard, wringing motion of his hands.  The diamond-Lord\nBolingbroke's gift--which ornamented Pope's left hand cut into the\nflesh of his little finger, so cruel was the gesture; and this little\nfinger was bleeding as Pope tripped forward, smiling.  A gentleman does\nnot incommode the public by obtruding the ugliness of a personal wound.\n\n\"Do I intrude?\" he queried.  \"Ah, well!  I also have dwelt in Arcadia.\"\nIt was bitter to comprehend that he had never done so.\n\nThe lovers were visibly annoyed; yet, if an interruption of their\npleasant commerce was decreed to be, it could not possibly have sprung,\nas they soon found, from a more sympathetic source.\n\nThese were not subtle persons.  Pope had the truth from them within ten\nminutes.  They loved each other; but John Hughes was penniless, and old\nFrederick Drew was, in consequence, obdurate.\n\n\"And, besides, he thinks you mean to marry her!\" said John Hughes.\n\n\"My dear man, he pardonably forgets that the utmost reach of my designs\nin common reason would be to have her as my kept mistress for a month\nor two,\" drawled Mr. Pope.  \"As concerns yourself, my good fellow, the\ncase is somewhat different.  Why, it is a veritable romance--an affair\nof Daphne and Corydon--although, to be unpardonably candid, the plot of\nyour romance, my young Arcadians, is not the most original conceivable.\nI think that the denouement need not baffle our imaginations.\"\n\nThe dwarf went toward Sarah Drew.  The chary sunlight had found the\ngold in her hair, and its glint was brightly visible to him.  \"My\ndear--\" he said.  His thin long fingers touched her capable hand.  It\nwas a sort of caress--half-timid.  \"My dear, I owe my life to you.  My\nbody is at most a flimsy abortion such as a night's exposure would have\nmade more tranquil than it is just now.  Yes, it was you who found a\ncaricature of the sort of man that Mr. Hughes here is, disabled,\nhelpless, and--for reasons which doubtless seemed to you\nsufficient--contrived that this unsightly parody continue in existence.\nI am not lovable, my dear.  I am only a hunchback, as you can see.  My\naspirations and my sickly imaginings merit only the derision of a\ncandid clean-souled being such as you are.\"  His finger-tips touched\nthe back of her hand again.  \"I think there was never a maker of\nenduring verse who did not at one period or another long to exchange an\nassured immortality for a sturdier pair of shoulders.  I think--I think\nthat I am prone to speak at random,\" Pope said, with his half-drowsy\nsmile.  \"Yet, none the less, an honest man, as our kinsmen in Adam\naverage, is bound to pay his equitable debts.\"\n\nShe said, \"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"I have perpetrated certain jingles,\" Pope returned.  \"I had not\ncomprehended until to-day they are the only children I shall leave\nbehind me.  Eh, and what would you make of them, my dear, could\ningenuity contrive a torture dire enough to force you into reading\nthem! . . .  Misguided people have paid me for contriving these\njingles.  So that I have money enough to buy you from your father just\nas I would purchase one of his heifers.  Yes, at the very least I have\nmoney, and I have earned it.  I will send your big-thewed adorer--I\nbelieve that Hughes is the name?--L500 of it this afternoon.  That sum,\nI gather, will be sufficient to remove your father's objection to your\nmarriage with Mr. Hughes.\"\n\nPope could not but admire himself tremendously.  Moreover, in such\nmatters no woman is blind.  Tears came into Sarah's huge brown eyes.\nThis tenderhearted girl was not thinking of John Hughes now.  Pope\nnoted the fact with the pettiest exultation.  \"Oh, you--you are good.\"\nSarah Drew spoke as with difficulty.\n\n\"No adjective, my dear, was ever applied with less discrimination.  It\nis merely that you have rendered no inconsiderable service to\nposterity, and merit a reward.\"\n\n\"Oh, and indeed, indeed, I was always fond of you----\"  The girl sobbed\nthis.\n\nShe would have added more, no doubt, since compassion is garrulous, had\nnot Pope's scratched hand dismissed a display of emotion as not\nentirely in consonance with the rules of the game.\n\n\"My dear, therein you have signally honored me.  There remains only to\noffer you my appreciation of your benevolence toward a sickly monster,\nand to entreat for my late intrusion--however unintentional--that\nforgiveness which you would not deny, I think, to any other impertinent\ninsect.\"\n\n\"Oh, but we have no words to thank you, sir----!\" Thus Hughes began.\n\n\"Then don't attempt it, my good fellow.  For phrase-spinning, as I can\nassure you, is the most profitless of all pursuits.\"  Whereupon Pope\nbowed low, wheeled, walked away.  Yes, he was wounded past sufferance;\nit seemed to him he must die of it.  Life was a farce, and Destiny an\noverseer who hiccoughed mandates.  Well, all that even Destiny could\nfind to gloat over, he reflected, was the tranquil figure of a smallish\ngentleman switching at the grass-blades with his cane as he sauntered\nunder darkening skies.\n\nFor a storm was coming on, and the first big drops of it were\nsplattering the terrace when Mr. Pope entered Lord Harcourt's mansion.\n\n\nPope went straight to his own rooms.  As he came in there was a vivid\nflash of lightning, followed instantaneously by a crashing, splitting\nnoise, like that of universes ripped asunder.  He did not honor the\nhigh uproar with attention.  This dwarf was not afraid of anything\nexcept the commission of an error in taste.\n\nThen, too, there were letters for him, laid ready on the writing-table.\nNothing of much importance he found there.--Here, though, was a rather\ndiverting letter from Eustace Budgell, that poor fool, abjectly\nthanking Mr. Pope for his advice concerning how best to answer the\natrocious calumnies on Budgell then appearing in _The Grub-Street\nJournal_,--and reposing, drolly enough, next the proof-sheets of an\nanonymous letter Pope had prepared for the forthcoming issue of that\npublication, wherein he sprightlily told how Budgell had poisoned Dr.\nTindal, after forging his will.  For even if Budgell had not in point\nof fact been guilty of these particular peccadilloes, he had quite\ncertainly committed the crime of speaking lightly of Mr. Pope, as \"a\nlittle envious animal,\" some seven years ago; and it was for this grave\nindiscretion that Pope was dexterously goading the man into insanity,\nand eventually drove him to suicide. . . .\n\nThe storm made the room dark and reading difficult.  Still, this was an\neven more amusing letter, from the all-powerful Duchess of Marlborough.\nIn as civil terms as her sick rage could muster, the frightened woman\noffered Mr. Pope L1,000 to suppress his verbal portrait of her, in the\ncharacter of Atossa, from his _Moral Essays_; and Pope straightway\ndecided to accept the bribe, and afterward to print his verses\nunchanged.  For the hag, as he reflected, very greatly needed to be\ntaught that in this world there was at least one person who did not\nquail before her tantrums.  There would be, moreover, even an\nelementary justice in thus robbing her who had robbed England at large.\nAnd, besides, her name was Sarah. . . .\n\nPope lighted four candles and set them before the long French mirror.\nHe stood appraising his many curious deformities while the storm raged.\nHe stood sidelong, peering over his left shoulder, in order to see the\noutline of his crooked back.  Nowhere in England, he reflected, was\nthere a person more pitiable and more repellent outwardly.\n\n\"And, oh, it would be droll,\" Pope said, aloud, \"if our exteriors were\never altogether parodies.  But time keeps a diary in our faces, and\nwrites a monstrously plain hand.  Now, if you take the first letter of\nMr. Alexander Pope's Christian name, and the first and last letters of\nhis surname, you have A. P. E.,\" Pope quoted, genially.  \"I begin to\nthink that Dennis was right.  What conceivable woman would not prefer a\nwell-set man of five-and-twenty to such a withered abortion?  And what\ndoes it matter, after all, that a hunchback has dared to desire a\nshapely brown-haired woman?\"\n\nPope came more near to the mirror.  \"Make answer, you who have dared to\nimagine that a goddess was ever drawn to descend into womanhood except\nby kisses, brawn and a clean heart.\"\n\nAnother peal of thunder bellowed.  The storm was growing furious.  \"Yet\nI have had a marvelous dream.  Now I awaken.  I must go on in the old\nround.  As long as my wits preserve their agility I must be able to\namuse, to flatter and, at need, to intimidate the patrons of that ape\nin the mirror, so that they will not dare refuse me the market-value of\nmy antics.  And Sarah Drew has declined an alliance such as this in\nfavor of a fresh-colored complexion and a pair of straight shoulders!\"\n\nPope thought a while.  \"And a clean heart!  She bargained royally,\ngiving love for nothing less than love.  The man is rustic, illiterate;\nhe never heard of Aristotle, he would be at a loss to distinguish\nbetween a trochee and a Titian, and if you mentioned Boileau to him\nwould probably imagine you were talking of cookery.  But he loves her.\nHe would forfeit eternity to save her a toothache.  And, chief of all,\nshe can make this robust baby happy, and she alone can make him happy.\nAnd so, she gives, gives royally--she gives, God bless her!\"\n\nRain, sullen rain, was battering the window.  \"And you--you hunchback\nin the mirror, you maker of neat rhymes--pray, what had you to offer?\nA coach-and-six, of course, and pin-money and furbelows and in the end\na mausoleum with unimpeachable Latin on it!  And--_pat\u00e9 sur pat\u00e9_--an\nunswerving devotion which she would share on almost equal terms with\nthe Collected Works of Alexander Pope.  And so she chose--chose brawn\nand a clean heart.\"\n\nThe dwarf turned, staggered, fell upon his bed.  \"God, make a man of\nme, make me a good brave man.  I loved her--oh, such as I am, You know\nthat I loved her!  You know that I desire her happiness above all\nthings.  Ah, no, for You know that I do not at bottom.  I want to hurt,\nto wound all living creatures, because they know how to be happy, and I\ndo not know how.  Ah, God, and why did You decree that I should never\nbe an obtuse and comely animal such as this John Hughes is?  I am so\ntired of being 'the great Mr. Pope,' and I want only the common joys of\nlife.\"\n\nThe hunchback wept.  It would be too curious to anatomize the writhings\nof his proud little spirit.\n\n\nNow some one tapped upon the door.  It was John Gay.  He was bidden to\nenter, and, complying, found Mr. Pope yawning over the latest of\nTonson's publications.\n\nGay's face was singularly portentous.  \"My friend,\" Gay blurted out, \"I\nbring news which will horrify you.  Believe me, I would never have\nmustered the pluck to bring it did I not love you.  I cannot let you\nhear it first in public and unprepared, as, otherwise, you would have\nto do.\"\n\n\"Do I not know you have the kindest heart in all the world?  Why, so\noutrageous are your amiable defects that they would be the public\nderision of your enemies if you had any,\" Pope returned.\n\nThe other poet evinced an awkward comminglement of consternation and\npity.  \"It appears that when this storm arose--why, Mistress Drew was\nwith a young man of the neighborhood--a John Hewet----\"  Gay was\nspeaking with unaccustomed rapidity.\n\n\"Hughes, I think,\" Pope interrupted, equably.\n\n\"Perhaps--I am not sure.  They sought shelter under a haycock.  You\nwill remember that first crash of thunder, as if the heavens were in\ndemolishment?  My friend, the reapers who had been laboring in the\nfields--who had been driven to such protection as the trees or hedges\nafforded----\"\n\n\"Get on!\" a shrill voice cried; \"for God's love, man, get on!\"  Mr.\nPope had risen.  This pallid shaken wisp was not in appearance the\ngreat Mr. Pope whose ingenuity had enabled Homeric warriors to excel in\nthe genteel.\n\n\"They first saw a little smoke. . . .  They found this Hughes with one\narm about the neck of Mistress Drew, and the other held over her face,\nas if to screen her from the lightning.  They were both\"--and here Gay\nhesitated.  \"They were both dead,\" he amended.\n\nPope turned abruptly.  Nakedness is of necessity uncouth, he held,\nwhether it be the body or the soul that is unveiled.  Mr. Pope went\ntoward a window which he opened, and he stood thus looking out for a\nbrief while.\n\n\"So she is dead,\" he said.  \"It is very strange.  So many rare\nfelicities of curve and color, so much of purity and kindliness and\nvalor and mirth, extinguished as one snuffs a candle!  Well!  I am\nsorry she is dead, for the child had a talent for living and got such\njoy out of it. . . .  Hers was a lovely happy life, but it was sterile.\nAlready nothing remains of her but dead flesh which must be huddled out\nof sight.  I shall not perish thus entirely, I believe.  Men will\nremember me.  Truly a mighty foundation for pride! when the utmost I\ncan hope for is but to be read in one island, and to be thrown aside at\nthe end of one age.  Indeed, I am not even sure of that much.  I print,\nand print, and print.  And when I collect my verses into books, I am\naltogether uncertain whether to took upon myself as a man building a\nmonument, or burying the dead.  It sometimes seems to me that each\npublication is but a solemn funeral of many wasted years.  For I have\ngiven all to the verse-making.  Granted that the sacrifice avails to\nrescue my name from oblivion, what will it profit me when I am dead and\ncare no more for men's opinions than Sarah Drew cares now for what I\nsay of her?  But then she never cared.  She loved John Hughes.  And she\nwas right.\"\n\nHe made an end of speaking, still peering out of the window with\nconsiderate narrowed eyes.\n\nThe storm was over.  In the beech-tree opposite a wren was raising\noptimistic outcry.  The sun had won his way through a black-bellied\nshred of cloud; upon the terrace below, a dripping Venus and a Perseus\nwere glistening as with white fire.  Past these, drenched gardens, the\nnatural wildness of which was judiciously restrained with walks, ponds,\ngrottoes, statuary and other rural elegancies, displayed the\nintermingled brilliancies of diamonds and emeralds, and glittered as\nwith pearls and rubies where tempest-battered roses were reviving in\nassertiveness.\n\n\"I think the storm is over,\" Mr. Pope remarked.  \"It is strange how\nviolent are these convulsions of nature. . . .  But nature is a\ntreacherous blowsy jade, who respects nobody.  A gentleman can but\nshrug under her onslaughts, and henceforward civilly avoid them.  It is\na consolation to reflect that they pass quickly.\"\n\nHe turned as in defiance.  \"Yes, yes!  It hurts.  But I envy them.\nYes, even I, that ugly spiteful hornet of a man! 'the great Mr. Pope,'\nwho will be dining with the proudest people in England within the hour\nand gloating over their deference!  For they presume to make a little\nfree with God occasionally, John, but never with me.  And _I_ envy\nthese dead young fools. . . .  You see, they loved each other, John.  I\nleft them, not an hour ago, the happiest of living creatures.  I looked\nback once.  I pretended to have dropped my handkerchief.  I imagine\nthey were talking of their wedding-clothes, for this broad-shouldered\nHughes was matching poppies and field-flowers to her complexion.  It\nwas a scene out of Theocritus.  I think Heaven was so well pleased by\nthe tableau that Heaven hastily resumed possession of its enactors in\norder to prevent any after-happenings from belittling that perfect\ninstant.\"\n\n\"Egad, and matrimony might easily have proved an anti-climax,\" Gay\nconsidered.\n\n\"Yes; oh, it is only Love that is blind, and not the lover necessarily.\nI know.  I suppose I always knew at the bottom of my heart.  This\nhamadryad was destined in the outcome to dwindle into a village\nhousewife, she would have taken a lively interest in the number of eggs\nthe hens were laying, she would even have assured her children,\nprecisely in the way her father spoke of John Hughes, that young people\nordinarily have foolish fancies which their rational elders agree to\ndisregard.  But as it is, no Eastern queen--not Semele herself--left\nearth more nobly--\"\n\nPope broke off short.  He produced his notebook, which he never went\nwithout, and wrote frowningly, with many erasures.  \"H'm, yes,\" he\nsaid; and he read aloud:\n\n  \"When Eastern lovers feed the funeral fire,\n  On the same pile the faithful fair expire;\n  Here pitying heaven that virtue mutual found,\n  And blasted both that it might neither wound.\n  Hearts so sincere the Almighty saw well pleased,\n  Sent His own lightning and the victims seized.\"\n\n\nThen Pope made a grimace.  \"No; the analogy is trim enough, but the\nlines lack fervor.  It is deplorable how much easier it is to express\nany emotion other than that of which one is actually conscious.\"  Pope\nhad torn the paper half-through before he reflected that it would help\nto fill a printed page.  He put it in his pocket.  \"But, come now, I am\nwriting to Lady Mary this afternoon.  You know how she loves oddities.\nBetween us--with prose as the medium, of course, since verse should,\nafter all, confine itself to the commemoration of heroes and royal\npersons--I believe we might make of this occurrence a neat and moving\n_pastorelle_--I should say, pastoral, of course, but my wits are\nwool-gathering.\"\n\nMr. Gay had the kindest heart in the universe.  Yet he, also, had\ndreamed of the perfected phrase, so worded that to alter a syllable of\nits wording would be little short of sacrilege.  Eyes kindling, he took\nup a pen.  \"Yes, yes, I understand.  Egad, it is an admirable subject.\nBut, then, I don't believe I ever saw these lovers----?\"\n\n\"John was a well-set man of about five-and-twenty,\" replied Mr. Pope;\n\"and Sarah was a brown woman of eighteen years, three months and\nfourteen days.\"\n\nThen these two dipped their pens and set about a moving composition,\nwhich has to-day its proper rating among Mr. Pope's Complete Works.\n\n\n\n\nPRO HONORIA\n\n\n\"_But that sense of negation, of theoretic insecurity, which was in the\nair, conspiring with what was of like tendency in himself, made of Lord\nUFFORD a central type of disillusion. . . .  He had been amiable\nbecause the general betise of humanity did not in his opinion greatly\nmatter, after all; and in reading these 'SATIRES' it is well-nigh\npainful to witness the blind and naked forces of nature and\ncircumstance surprising him in the uncontrollable movements of his own\nso carefully guarded heart._\"\n\n\n\n  Why is a handsome wife adored\n  By every coxcomb but her lord?\n\n  From yonder puppet-man inquire\n  Who wisely hides his wood and wire;\n  Shows Sheba's queen completely dress'd\n  And Solomon in royal vest;\n\n  But view them litter'd on the floor,\n  Or strung on pegs behind the door,\n  Punch is exactly of a piece\n  With Lorrain's duke, and prince of Greece.\n\n  HORACE CALVERLEY.--_Petition to the Duke of Ormskirk_.\n\n\n\n\nPRO HONORIA\n\nIn the early winter of 1761 the Earl of Bute, then Secretary of State,\ngave vent to an outburst of unaccustomed profanity.  Mr. Robert\nCalverley, who represented England at the Court of St. Petersburg, had\nresigned his office without prelude or any word of explanation.  This\ninfuriated Bute, since his pet scheme was to make peace with Russia and\nthereby end the Continental War.  Now all was to do again; the minister\nraged, shrugged, furnished a new emissary with credentials, and marked\nCalverley's name for punishment.\n\nAs much, indeed, was written to Calverley by Lord Ufford, the poet,\ndiarist, musician and virtuoso:\n\n\nOur Scottish Mortimer, it appears, is unwilling to have the map of\nEurope altered because Mr. Robert Calverley has taken a whim to go into\nItaly.  He is angrier than I have ever known him to be.  He swears that\nwith a pen's flourish you have imperiled the well-being of England, and\nraves in the same breath of the preferment he had designed for you.\nBeware of him.  For my own part, I shrug and acquiesce, because I am\nfamiliar with your pranks.  I merely venture to counsel that you do not\ncrown the Pelion of abuse, which our statesmen are heaping upon you,\nwith the Ossa of physical as well as political suicide.  Hasten on your\nItalian jaunt, for Umfraville, who is now with me at Carberry Hill, has\npublicly declared that if you dare re-appear in England he will have\nyou horsewhipped by his footmen.  In consequence, I would most\nearnestly advise----\n\n\nMr. Calverley read no further, but came straightway into England.  He\nhad not been in England since his elopement, three years before that\nspring, with the Marquis of Umfraville's betrothed, Lord Radnor's\ndaughter, whom Calverley had married at Calais.  Mr. Calverley and his\nwife were presently at Carberry Hill, Lord Ufford's home, where,\narriving about moon-rise, they found a ball in progress.\n\nTheir advent caused a momentary check to merriment.  The fiddlers\nceased, because Lord Ufford had signaled them.  The fine guests paused\nin their stately dance.  Lord Ufford, in a richly figured suit, came\nhastily to Lady Honoria Calverley, his high heels tapping audibly upon\nthe floor, and with gallantry lifted her hand toward his lips.  Her\nhusband he embraced, and the two men kissed each other, as was the\ncustom of the age.  Chatter and laughter rose on every side as pert and\nmerry as the noises of a brook in springtime.\n\n\"I fear that as Lord Umfraville's host,\" young Calverley at once began,\n\"you cannot with decorum convey to the ignoramus my opinion as to his\nability to conjugate the verb _to dare_.\"\n\n\"Why, but no! you naturally demand a duel,\" the poet-earl returned.\n\"It is very like you.  I lament your decision, but I will attempt to\narrange the meeting for to-morrow morning.\"\n\nLord Ufford smiled and nodded to the musicians.  He finished the dance\nto admiration, as this lean dandified young man did\neverything--\"assiduous to win each fool's applause,\" as his own verses\nscornfully phrase it.  Then Ufford went about his errand of death and\nconversed for a long while with Umfraville.\n\nAfterward Lord Ufford beckoned to Calverley, who shrugged and returned\nMr. Erwyn's snuff-box, which Calverley had been admiring.  He followed\nthe earl into a side-room opening upon the Venetian Chamber wherein the\nfete was.  Ufford closed the door.  You saw that he had put away the\nexterior of mirth that hospitality demanded of him, and perturbation\nshowed in the lean countenance which was by ordinary so proud and so\namiably peevish.\n\n\"Robin, you have performed many mad actions in your life!\" he said;\n\"but this return into the three kingdoms out-Herods all!  Did I not\nwarn you against Umfraville!\"\n\n\"Why, certainly you did,\" returned Mr. Calverley.  \"You informed\nme--which was your duty as a friend--of this curmudgeon's boast that he\nwould have me horsewhipped if I dared venture into England.  You will\nreadily conceive that any gentleman of self-respect cannot permit such\nfarcical utterances to be delivered without appending a gladiatorial\nepilogue.  Well! what are the conditions of this duel?\"\n\n\"Oh, fool that I have been!\" cried Ufford, who was enabled now by\nvirtue of their seclusion to manifest his emotion.  \"I, who have known\nyou all your life----!\"\n\nHe paced the room.  Pleading music tinged the silence almost insensibly.\n\n\"Heh, Fate has an imperial taste in humor!\" the poet said.  \"Robin, we\nhave been more than brothers.  And it is I, I, of all persons living,\nwho have drawn you into this imbroglio!\"\n\n\"My danger is not very apparent as yet,\" said Calverley, \"if Umfraville\ncontrols his sword no better than his tongue.\"\n\nMy lord of Ufford went on:  \"There is no question of a duel.  It is as\nwell to spare you what Lord Umfraville replied to my challenge.  Let it\nsuffice that we do not get sugar from the snake.  Besides, the man has\nhis grievance.  Robin, have you forgot that necklace you and Pevensey\ntook from Umfraville some three years ago--before you went into Russia?\"\n\nCalverley laughed.  The question recalled an old hot-headed time when,\nexalted to a frolicsome zone by the discovery of Lady Honoria Pomfret's\nlove for him, he planned the famous jest which he and the mad Earl of\nPevensey perpetrated upon Umfraville.  This masquerade won quick\napplause.  Persons of ton guffawed like ploughboys over the\ndiscomfiture of an old hunks thus divertingly stripped of his bride,\nall his betrothal gifts, and of the very clothes he wore.  An anonymous\nscribbler had detected in the occurrence a denouement suited to the\nstage and had constructed a comedy around it, which, when produced by\nthe Duke's company, had won acclaim from hilarious auditors.\n\nSo Calverley laughed heartily.  \"Gad, what a jest that was!  This\nUmfraville comes to marry Honoria.  And highwaymen attack his coach!  I\nwould give L50 to have witnessed this usurer's arrival at Denton Honor\nin his underclothes! and to have seen his monkey-like grimaces when he\nlearned that Honoria and I were already across the Channel!\"\n\n\"You robbed him, though----\"\n\n\"Indeed, for beginners at peculation we did not do so badly.  We robbed\nhim and his valet of everything in the coach, including their breeches.\nYou do not mean that Pevensey has detained the poor man's wedding\ntrousers?  If so, it is unfortunate, because this loud-mouthed miser\nhas need of them in order that he may be handsomely interred.\"\n\n\"Lord Umfraville's wedding-suit was stuffed with straw, hung on a pole\nand paraded through London by Pevensey, March, Selwyn and some dozen\nother madcaps, while six musicians marched before them.  The clothes\nwere thus conveyed to Umfraville's house.  I think none of us would\nhave relished a joke like that were he the butt of it.\"\n\nNow the poet's lean countenance was turned upon young Calverley, and as\nalways, Ufford evoked that nobility in Calverley which follies veiled\nbut had not ever killed.\n\n\"Egad,\" said Robert Calverley; \"I grant you that all this was\ninfamously done.  I never authorized it.  I shall kill Pevensey.\nIndeed, I will do more,\" he added, with a flourish.  \"For I will\napologize to Umfraville, and this very night.\"\n\nBut Ufford was not disposed to levity.  \"Let us come to the point,\" he\nsadly said.  \"Pevensey returned everything except the necklace which\nUmfraville had intended to be his bridal gift.  Pevensey conceded the\njest, in fine; and denied all knowledge of any necklace.\"\n\nIt was an age of accommodating morality.  Calverley sketched a whistle,\nand showed no other trace of astonishment.\n\n\"I see.  The fool confided in the spendthrift.  My dear, I understand.\nIn nature Pevensey gave the gems to some nymph of Sadler's Wells or\nCovent Garden.  For I was out of England.  And so he capped his knavery\nwith insolence.  It is an additional reason why Pevensey should not\nlive to scratch a gray head.  It is, however, an affront to me that\nUmfraville should have believed him.  I doubt if I may overlook that,\nHorace?\"\n\n\"I question if he did believe.  But, then, what help had he?  This\nPevensey is an earl.  His person as a peer of England is inviolable.\nNo statute touches him directly, because he may not be confined except\nby the King's personal order.  And it is tolerably notorious that\nPevensey is in Lord Bute's pay, and that our Scottish Mortimer, to do\nhim justice, does not permit his spies to be injured.\"\n\nNow Mr. Calverley took snuff.  The music without was now more audible,\nand it had shifted to a merrier tune.\n\n\"I think I comprehend.  Pevensey and I--whatever were our motives--have\ncommitted a robbery.  Pevensey, as the law runs, is safe.  I, too, was\nsafe as long as I kept out of England.  As matters stand, Lord\nUmfraville intends to press a charge of theft against me.  And I am in\ndisgrace with Bute, who is quite content to beat offenders with a\ncrooked stick.  This confluence of two-penny accidents is annoying.\"\n\n\"It is worse than you know,\" my lord of Ufford returned.  He opened the\ndoor which led to the Venetian Chamber.  A surge of music, of laughter,\nand of many lights invaded the room wherein they stood.  \"D'ye see\nthose persons, just past Umfraville, so inadequately disguised as\ngentlemen?  They are from Bow Street.  Lord Umfraville intends to\napprehend you here to-night.\"\n\n\"He has an eye for the picturesque,\" drawled Calverley.  \"My tragedy,\nto do him justice, could not be staged more strikingly.  Those\nadditional alcoves have improved the room beyond belief.  I must\napologize for not having rendered my compliments a trifle earlier.\"\n\nInternally he outstormed Termagaunt.  It was infamous enough, in all\nconscience, to be arrested, but to have half the world of fashion as\nwitnessess of ones discomfiture was perfectly intolerable.  He\nrecognized the excellent chance he had of being the most prominent\nfigure upon some scaffold before long, but that contingency did not\ngreatly trouble Calverley, as set against the certainty of being made\nridiculous within the next five minutes.\n\nIn consequence, he frowned and rearranged the fall of his shirt-frill a\nwhit the more becomingly.\n\n\"Yes, for hate sharpens every faculty,\" the earl went on.  \"Even\nUmfraville understands that you do not fear death.  So he means to have\nyou tried like any common thief while all your quondam friends sit and\nsnigger.  And you will be convicted----\"\n\n\"Why, necessarily, since I am not as Pevensey.  Of course, I must\nconfess I took the necklace.\"\n\n\"And Pevensey must stick to the tale that he knows nothing of any\nnecklace.  Dear Robin, this means Newgate.  Accident deals very hardly\nwith us, Robin, for this means Tyburn Hill.\"\n\n\"Yes; I suppose it means my death,\" young Calverley assented.  \"Well! I\nhave feasted with the world and found its viands excellent.  The\nbanquet ended, I must not grumble with my host because I find his\nchoice of cordials not altogether to my liking.\"  Thus speaking, he was\naware of nothing save that the fiddlers were now about an air to which\nhe had often danced with his dear wife.\n\n\"I have a trick yet left to save our honor,----\" Lord Ufford turned to\na table where wine and glasses were set ready.  \"I propose a toast.\nLet us drink--for the last time--to the honor of the Calverleys.\"\n\n\"It is an invitation I may not decorously refuse.  And yet--it may be\nthat I do not understand you?\"\n\nMy lord of Ufford poured wine into two glasses.  These glasses were\nfrom among the curios he collected so industriously--tall, fragile\nthings, of seventeenth century make, very intricately cut with roses\nand thistles, and in the bottom of each glass a three-penny piece was\nembedded.  Lord Ufford took a tiny vial from his pocket and emptied its\ncontents into the glass which stood the nearer to Mr. Calverley.\n\n\"This is Florence water.  We dabblers in science are experimenting with\nit at Gresham College.  A taste of it means death--a painless, quick\nand honorable death.  You will have died of a heart seizure.  Come,\nRobin, let us drink to the honor of the Calverleys.\"\n\nThe poet-earl paused for a little while.  Now he was like some seer of\nsupernal things.\n\n\"For look you,\" said Lord Ufford, \"we come of honorable blood.  We two\nare gentlemen.  We have our code, and we may not infringe upon it.  Our\ncode does not invariably square with reason, and I doubt if Scripture\nwould afford a dependable foundation.  So be it!  We have our code and\nwe may not infringe upon it.  There have been many Calverleys who did\nnot fear their God, but there was never any one of them who did not\nfear dishonor.  I am the head of no less proud a house.  As such, I\ncounsel you to drink and die within the moment.  It is not possible a\nCalverley survive dishonor.  Oh, God!\" the poet cried, and his voice\nbroke; \"and what is honor to this clamor within me!  Robin, I love you\nbetter than I do this talk of honor!  For, Robin, I have loved you\nlong! so long that what we do to-night will always make life hideous to\nme!\"\n\nCalverley was not unmoved, but he replied in the tone of daily\nintercourse.  \"It is undoubtedly absurd to perish here, like some\nunreasonable adversary of the Borgias.  Your device is rather\noutrageously horrific, Horace, like a bit out of your own romance--yes,\negad, it is pre-eminently worthy of the author of _The Vassal of\nSpalatro_.  Still I can understand that it is preferable to having fat\nand greasy fellows squander a shilling for the privilege of perching\nupon a box while I am being hanged.  And I think I shall accept your\ntoast--\n\n\"You will be avenged,\" Ufford said, simply.\n\n\"My dear, as if I ever questioned that!  Of course, you will kill\nPevensey first and Umfraville afterward.  Only I want to live.  For I\nwas meant to play a joyous role wholeheartedly in the big comedy of\nlife.  So many people find the world a dreary residence,\" Mr. Calverley\nsighed, \"that it is really a pity some one of these long-faced\nstolidities cannot die now instead of me.  For I have found life\nwonderful throughout.\"\n\nThe brows of Ufford knit.  \"Would you consent to live as a transported\nfelon?  I have much money.  I need not tell you the last penny is at\nyour disposal.  It might be possible to bribe.  Indeed, Lord Bute is\nall-powerful to-day and he would perhaps procure a pardon for you at my\nentreaty.  He is so kind as to admire my scribblings. . .  Or you might\nlive among your fellow-convicts somewhere over sea for a while longer.\nI had not thought that such would be your choice----\"  Here Ufford\nshrugged, restrained by courtesy.  \"Besides, Lord Bute is greatly\nangered with you, because you have endangered his Russian alliance.\nHowever, if you wish it, I will try----\"\n\n\"Oh, for that matter, I do not much fear Lord Bute, because I bring him\nthe most welcome news he has had in many a day.  I may tell you since\nit will be public to-morrow.  The Tzaritza Elizabeth, our implacable\nenemy, died very suddenly three weeks ago.  Peter of Holstein-Gottrop\nreigns to-day in Russia, and I have made terms with him.  I came to\ntell Lord Bute the Cossack troops have been recalled from Prussia.  The\nwar is at an end.\"  Young Calverley meditated and gave his customary\nboyish smile.  \"Yes, I discharged my Russian mission after all--even\nafter I had formally relinquished it--because I was so opportunely\naided by the accident of the Tzaritza's death.  And Bute cares only for\nresults.  So I would explain to him that I resigned my mission simply\nbecause in Russia my wife could not have lived out another year----\"\n\nThe earl exclaimed, \"Then Honoria is ill!\" Mr. Calverley did not\nattend, but stood looking out into the Venetian Chamber.\n\n\"See, Horace, she is dancing with Anchester while I wait here so near\nto death.  She dances well.  But Honoria does everything adorably.  I\ncannot tell you--oh, not even you!--how happy these three years have\nbeen with her.  Eh, well! the gods are jealous of such happiness.  You\nwill remember how her mother died?  It appears that Honoria is\nthreatened with a slow consumption, and a death such as her mother's\nwas.  She does not know.  There was no need to frighten her.  For\nalthough the rigors of another Russian winter, as all physicians tell\nme, would inevitably prove fatal to her, there is no reason why my\ndearest dear should not continue to laugh just as she always does--for\na long, bright and happy while in some warm climate such as Italy's.\nIn nature I resigned my appointment.  I did not consider England, or my\nown trivial future, or anything of that sort.  I considered only\nHonoria.\"\n\nHe gazed for many moments upon the woman whom he loved.  His speech\ntook on an odd simplicity.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I think that in the end Bute would procure a pardon for me.\nBut not even Bute can override the laws of England.  I would have to be\ntried first, and have ballads made concerning me, and be condemned, and\nso on.  That would detain Honoria in England, because she is\nsufficiently misguided to love me.  I could never persuade her to leave\nme with my life in peril.  She could not possibly survive an English\nwinter.\"  Here Calverley evinced unbridled mirth.  \"The irony of events\nis magnificent.  There is probably no question of hanging or even of\ntransportation.  It is merely certain that if I venture from this room\nI bring about Honoria's death as incontestably as if I strangled her\nwith these two hands.  So I choose my own death in preference.  It will\ngrieve Honoria----\"  His voice was not completely steady.  \"But she is\nyoung.  She will forget me, for she forgets easily, and she will be\nhappy.  I look to you to see--even before you have killed\nPevensey--that Honoria goes into Italy.  For she admires and loves you,\nalmost as much as I do, Horace, and she will readily be guided by\nyou----\"\n\nHe cried my lord of Ufford's given name some two or three times, for\nyoung Calverley had turned, and he had seen Ufford's face.\n\nThe earl moistened his lips.  \"You are a fool,\" he said, with a thin\nvoice.  \"Why do you trouble me by being better than I?  Or do you only\nposture for my benefit?  Do you deal honestly with me, Robert\nCalverley?--then swear it----\"  He laughed here, very horribly.  \"Ah,\nno, when did you ever lie!  You do not lie--not you!\"\n\nHe waited for a while.  \"But I am otherwise.  I dare to lie when the\noccasion promises.  I have desired Honoria since the first moment\nwherein I saw her.  I may tell you now.  I think that you do not\nremember.  We gathered cherries.  I ate two of them which had just lain\nupon her knee----\"\n\nHis hands had clenched each other, and his lips were drawn back so that\nyou saw his exquisite teeth, which were ground together.  He stood thus\nfor a little, silent.\n\nThen Ufford began again:  \"I planned all this.  I plotted this with\nUmfraville.  I wrote you such a letter as would inevitably draw you to\nyour death.  I wished your death.  For Honoria would then be freed of\nyou.  I would condole with her.  She is readily comforted, impatient of\nsorrow, incapable of it, I dare say.  She would have married me. . . .\nWhy must I tell you this?  Oh, I am Fate's buffoon!  For I have won, I\nhave won! and there is that in me which will not accept the stake I\ncheated for.\"\n\n\"And you,\" said Calverley--\"this thing is you!\"\n\n\"A helpless reptile now,\" said Ufford.  \"I have not the power to check\nLord Umfraville in his vengeance.  You must be publicly disgraced, and\nmust, I think, be hanged even now when it will not benefit me at all.\nIt may be I shall weep for that some day!  Or else Honoria must die,\nbecause an archangel could not persuade her to desert you in your\nperil.  For she loves you--loves you to the full extent of her merry\nand shallow nature.  Oh, I know that, as you will never know it.  I\nshall have killed Honoria!  I shall not weep when Honoria dies.\nHarkee, Robin! they are dancing yonder.  It is odd to think that I\nshall never dance again.\"\n\n\"Horace--!\" the younger man said, like a person of two minds.  He\nseemed to choke.  He gave a frantic gesture.  \"Oh, I have loved you.  I\nhave loved nothing as I have loved you.\"\n\n\"And yet you chatter of your passion for Honoria!\" Lord Ufford\nreturned, with a snarl.  \"I ask what proof is there of this?--Why, that\nyou have surrendered your well-being in this world through love of her.\nBut I gave what is vital.  I was an honorable gentleman without any act\nin all my life for which I had need to blush.  I loved you as I loved\nno other being in the universe.\"  He spread his hands, which now\ntwitched horribly.  \"You will never understand.  It does not matter.  I\ndesired Honoria.  To-day through my desire of her, I am that monstrous\nthing which you alone know me to be.  I think I gave up much.  _Pro\nhonoria!_\" he chuckled.  \"The Latin halts, but, none the less, the jest\nis excellent.\"\n\n\"You have given more than I would dare to give,\" said Calverley.  He\nshuddered.\n\n\"And to no end!\" cried Ufford.  \"Ah, fate, the devil and that code I\nmocked are all in league to cheat me!\"\n\nSaid Calverley:  \"The man whom I loved most is dead.  Oh, had the world\nbeen searched between the sunrise and the sunsetting there had not been\nfound his equal.  And now, poor fool, I know that there was never any\nman like this!\"\n\n\"Nay, there was such a man,\" the poet said, \"in an old time which I\nalmost forget.  To-day he is quite dead.  There is only a poor wretch\nwho has been faithless in all things, who has not even served the devil\nfaithfully.\"\n\n\"Why, then, you lackey with a lackey's soul, attend to what I say.  Can\nyou make any terms with Umfraville?\"\n\n\"I can do nothing,\" Ufford replied.  \"You have robbed him--as me--of\nwhat he most desired.  You have made him the laughing-stock of England.\nHe does not pardon any more than I would pardon.\"\n\n\"And as God lives and reigns, I do not greatly blame him,\" said young\nCalverley.  \"This man at least was wronged.  Concerning you I do not\nspeak, because of a false dream I had once very long ago.  Yet\nUmfraville was treated infamously.  I dare concede what I could not\npermit another man to say and live, now that I drink a toast which I\nmust drink alone.  For I drink to the honor of the Calverleys.  I have\nnot ever lied to any person in this world, and so I may not drink with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you drink because you know your death to be the one event\nwhich can insure her happiness,\" cried Ufford.  \"We are not much\nunlike.  And I dare say it is only an imaginary Honoria we love, after\nall.  Yet, look, my fellow-Ixion! for to the eye at least is she not\nperfect?\"\n\nThe two men gazed for a long while.  Amid that coterie of exquisites,\nwherein allusion  to whatever might be ugly in the world was tacitly\nallowed to be unmentionable, Lady Honoria glitteringly went about the\nmoment's mirthful business with lovely ardor.  You saw now unmistakably\nthat \"Light Queen of Elfdom, dead Titania's heir\" of whom Ufford writes\nin the fourth Satire.  Honoria's prettiness, rouged, frail, and\nmodishly enhanced, allured the eye from all less elfin brilliancies;\nand as she laughed among so many other relishers of life her charms\nbecame the more instant, just as a painting quickens in every tint when\nset in an appropriate frame.\n\n\"There is no other way,\" her husband said.  He drank and toasted what\nwas dearest in the world, smiling to think how death came to him in\nthat wine's familiar taste.  \"I drink to the most lovely of created\nladies!  and to her happiness!\"\n\nHe snapped the stem of the glass and tossed it joyously aside.\n\n\"Assuredly, there is no other way,\" said Ufford.  \"And armored by that\nknowledge, even I may drink as honorable people do.  Pro honoria!\" Then\nthis man also broke his emptied glass.\n\n\"How long have I to live?\" said Calverley, and took snuff.\n\n\"Why, thirty years, I think, unless you duel too immoderately,\" replied\nLord Ufford,--\"since while you looked at Honoria I changed our glasses.\nNo! no! a thing done has an end.  Besides, it is not unworthy of me.\nSo go boldly to the Earl of Bute and tell him all.  You are my cousin\nand my successor.  Yes, very soon you, too, will be a peer of England\nand as safe from molestation as is Lord Pevensey.  I am the first to\ntender my congratulations.  Now I make certain that they are not\npremature.\"\n\nThe poet laughed at this moment as a man may laugh in hell.  He reeled.\nHis lean face momentarily contorted, and afterward the poet died.\n\n\"I am Lord Ufford,\" said Calverley aloud.  \"The person of a peer is\ninviolable----\"  He presently looked downward from rapt gazing at his\nwife.\n\nFresh from this horrible half-hour, he faced a future so alluring as by\nits beauty to intimidate him.  Youth, love, long years of happiness,\nand (by this capricious turn) now even opulence, were the ingredients\nof a captivating vista.  And yet he needs must pause a while to think\nof the dear comrade he had lost--of that loved boy, his pattern in the\ntime of their common youthfulness which gleamed in memory as bright and\nmisty as a legend, and of the perfect chevalier who had been like a\ntouchstone to Robert Calverley a bare half-hour ago.  He knelt, touched\nlightly the fallen jaw, and lightly kissed the cheek of this poor\nwreckage; and was aware that the caress was given with more tenderness\nthan Robert Calverley had shown in the same act a bare half-hour ago.\n\nMeanwhile the music of a country dance urged the new Earl of Ufford to\ncome and frolic where every one was laughing; and to partake with gusto\nof the benefits which chance had provided; and to be forthwith as merry\nas was decorous in a peer of England.\n\n\n\n\nTHE IRRESISTIBLE OGLE\n\n\n\"_But after SHERIDAN had risen to a commanding position in the gay life\nof London, he rather disliked to be known as a playwright or a poet,\nand preferred to be regarded as a statesman and a man of fashion who\n'set the pace' in all pastimes of the opulent and idle.  Yet, whatever\nhe really thought of his own writings, and whether or not he did them,\nas Stevenson used to say, 'just for fun,' the fact remains that he was\neasily the most distinguished and brilliant dramatist of an age which\nproduced in SHERIDAN'S solemn vagaries one of its most characteristic\nproducts._\"\n\n\n\n  Look on this form,--where humor, quaint and sly,\n  Dimples the cheek, and points the beaming eye;\n  Where gay invention seems to boast its wiles\n  In amorous hint, and half-triumphant smiles.\n\n  Look on her well--does she seem form'd to teach?\n  Should you expect to hear this lady preach?\n  Is gray experience suited to her youth?\n  Do solemn sentiments become that mouth?\n\n  Bid her be grave, those lips should rebel prove\n  To every theme that slanders mirth or love.\n\n  RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN.--_Second Prologue to The Rivals_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE IRRESISTIBLE OGLE\n\nThe devotion of Mr. Sheridan to the Dean of Winchester's daughter, Miss\nEsther Jane Ogle--or \"the irresistible Ogle,\" as she was toasted at the\nKit-cat--was now a circumstance to be assumed in the polite world of\nLondon.  As a result, when the parliamentarian followed her into\nScotland, in the spring of 1795, people only shrugged.\n\n\"Because it proves that misery loves company,\" was Mr. Fox's\nobservation at Wattier's, hard upon two in the morning.  \"Poor Sherry,\nas an inconsolable widower, must naturally have some one to share his\ngrief.  He perfectly comprehends that no one will lament the death of\nhis wife more fervently than her successor.\"\n\n\nIn London Mr. Fox thus worded his interpretation of the matter; and\nspoke, oddly enough, at the very moment that in Edinburgh Mr. Sheridan\nreturned to his lodgings in Abercromby Place, deep in the reminiscences\nof a fortunate evening at cards.  In consequence, Mr. Sheridan entered\nthe room so quietly that the young man who was employed in turning over\nthe contents of the top bureau-drawer was taken unprepared.\n\nBut in the marauder's nature, as far as resolution went, was little\nlacking.  \"Silence!\" he ordered, and with the mandate a pistol was\nleveled upon the representative for the borough of Stafford.  \"One cry\nfor help, and you perish like a dog.  I warn you that I am a desperate\nman.\"\n\n\"Now, even at a hazard of discourtesy, I must make bold to question\nyour statement,\" said Mr. Sheridan, \"although, indeed, it is not so\nmuch the recklessness as the masculinity which I dare call into\ndispute.\"\n\nHe continued, in his best parliamentary manner, a happy blending of\nreproach, omniscience and pardon.  \"Only two months ago,\" said Mr.\nSheridan, \"I was so fortunate as to encounter a lady who, alike through\nthe attractions of her person and the sprightliness of her\nconversation, convinced me I was on the road to fall in love after the\nhigh fashion of a popular romance.  I accordingly make her a\ndeclaration.  I am rejected.  I besiege her with the customary\nartillery of sonnets, bouquets, serenades, bonbons, theater-tickets and\nthreats of suicide.  In fine, I contract the habit of proposing to Miss\nOgle on every Wednesday; and so strong is my infatuation that I follow\nher as far into the north as Edinburgh in order to secure my eleventh\nrejection at half-past ten last evening.\"\n\n\"I fail to understand,\" remarked the burglar, \"how all this prolix\naccount of your amours can possibly concern me.\"\n\n\"You are at least somewhat involved in the deplorable climax,\" Mr.\nSheridan returned.  \"For behold! at two in the morning I discover the\nobject of my adoration and the daughter of an estimable prelate, most\ncalumniously clad and busily employed in rumpling my supply of cravats.\nIf ever any lover was thrust into a more ambiguous position, madam,\nhistorians have touched on his dilemma with marked reticence.\"\n\nHe saw--and he admired--the flush which mounted to his visitor's brow.\nAnd then, \"I must concede that appearances are against me, Mr.\nSheridan,\" the beautiful intruder said.  \"And I hasten to protest that\nmy presence in your apartments at this hour is prompted by no unworthy\nmotive.  I merely came to steal the famous diamond which you brought\nfrom London--the Honor of Eiran.\"\n\n\"Incomparable Esther Jane,\" ran Mr. Sheridan's answer, \"that stone is\nnow part of a brooch which was this afternoon returned to my cousin's,\nthe Earl of Eiran's, hunting-lodge near Melrose.  He intends the gem\nwhich you are vainly seeking among my haberdashery to be the adornment\nof his promised bride in the ensuing June.  I confess to no\noverwhelming admiration as concerns this raucous if meritorious young\nperson; and will even concede that the thought of her becoming my\nkinswoman rouses in me an inevitable distaste, no less attributable to\nthe discord of her features than to the source of her eligibility to\ndisfigure the peerage--that being her father's lucrative transactions\nin Pork, which I find indigestible in any form.\"\n\n\"A truce to paltering!\" Miss Ogle cried.  \"That jewel was stolen from\nthe temple at Moorshedabad, by the Earl of Eiran's grandfather, during\nthe confusion necessarily attendant on the glorious battle of Plassy.\"\nShe laid down the pistol, and resumed in milder tones:  \"From an\nage-long existence as the left eye of Ganesh it was thus converted into\nthe loot of an invader.  To restore this diamond to its lawful,\nalthough no doubt polygamous and inefficiently-attired proprietors is\nat this date impossible.  But, oh! what claim have you to its\npossession?\"\n\n\"Why, none whatever,\" said the parliamentarian; \"and to contend as much\nwould be the apex of unreason.  For this diamond belongs, of course, to\nmy cousin the Earl of Eiran----\"\n\n\"As a thief's legacy!\"  She spoke with signs of irritation.\n\n\"Eh, eh, you go too fast!  Eiran, to do him justice, is not a graduate\nin peculation.  At worst, he is only the sort of fool one's cousins\nordinarily are.\"\n\nThe trousered lady walked to and fro for a while, with the impatience\nof a caged lioness.  \"I perceive I must go more deeply into matters,\"\nMiss Ogle remarked, and, with that habitual gesture which he fondly\nrecognized, brushed back a straying lock of hair.  \"In any event,\" she\ncontinued, \"you cannot with reason deny that the world's wealth is\ninequitably distributed?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" Mr. Sheridan returned, \"as a member of Parliament, I have\nnecessarily made it a rule never to understand political economy.  It\nis as apt as not to prove you are selling your vote to the wrong side\nof the House, and that hurts one's conscience.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is because you are a man.  Men are not practical.  None of\nyou has ever dared to insist on his opinion about anything until he had\nsecured the cowardly corroboration of a fact or so to endorse him.  It\nis a pity.  Yet, since through no fault of yours your sex is invariably\nmisled by its hallucinations as to the importance of being rational, I\nwill refrain from logic and statistics.  In a word, I simply inform you\nthat I am a member of the League of Philanthropic Larcenists.\"\n\n\"I had not previously heard of this organization,\" said Mr. Sheridan,\nand not without suspecting his response to be a masterpiece in the\ninadequate.\n\n\"Our object is the benefit of society at large,\" Miss Ogle explained;\n\"and our obstacles so far have been, in chief, the fetish of\nproprietary rights and the ubiquity of the police.\"\n\nAnd with that she seated herself and told him of the league's inception\nby a handful of reflective persons, admirers of Rousseau and converts\nto his tenets, who were resolved to better the circumstances of the\nindigent.  With amiable ardor Miss Ogle explained how from the petit\nlarcenies of charity-balls and personally solicited subscriptions the\nleague had mounted to an ampler field of depredation; and through what\nmeans it now took toll from every form of wealth unrighteously\nacquired.  Divertingly she described her personal experiences in the\nseparation of usurers, thieves, financiers, hereditary noblemen,\npopular authors, and other social parasites, from the ill-got profits\nof their disreputable vocations.  And her account of how, on the\npreceding Tuesday, she, single-handed, had robbed Sir Alexander\nMcRae--who then enjoyed a fortune and an enviable reputation for\nphilanthropy, thanks to the combination of glucose, vitriol and other\nchemicals which he prepared under the humorous pretext of manufacturing\nbeer--wrung high encomiums from Mr. Sheridan.\n\n\"The proceeds of these endeavors,\" Miss Ogle added, \"are\nconscientiously devoted to ameliorating the condition of meritorious\npaupers.  I would be happy to submit to you our annual report.  Then\nyou may judge for yourself how many families we have snatched from the\ndepths of poverty and habitual intoxication to the comparative comfort\nof a vine-embowered cottage.\"\n\nMr. Sheridan replied:  \"I have not ever known of any case where\nadoration needed an affidavit for foundation.  Oh, no, incomparable\nEsther Jane!  I am not in a position to be solaced by the reports of a\ncorresponding secretary.  I gave my heart long since; to-night I fling\nmy confidence into the bargain; and am resolved to serve wholeheartedly\nthe cause to which you are devoted.  In consequence, I venture to\npropose my name for membership in the enterprise you advocate and\nindescribably adorn.\"\n\nMiss Ogle was all one blush, such was the fervor of his utterance.\n\"But first you must win your spurs, Mr. Sheridan.  I confess you are\nnot abhorrent to me,\" she hurried on, \"for you are the most\nfascinatingly hideous man I have ever seen; and it was always the\napprehension that you might look on burglary as an unmaidenly avocation\nwhich has compelled me to discourage your addresses.  Now all is plain;\nand should you happen to distinguish yourself in robbery of the\ncriminally opulent, you will have, I believe, no reason to complain of\na twelfth refusal.  I cannot modestly say more.\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"It is a bargain.  We will agree that I bereave some\nperson of either stolen or unearned property, say, to the value of\nL10,000----\" And with his usual carefulness in such matters, Mr.\nSheridan entered the wager in his notebook.\n\nShe yielded him her hand in token of assent.  And he, depend upon it,\nkissed that velvet trifle fondly.\n\n\"And now,\" said Mr. Sheridan, \"to-morrow we will visit Bemerside and\nobtain possession of that crystal which is in train to render me the\nhappiest of men.  The task will be an easy one, as Eiran is now in\nEngland, and his servants for the most part are my familiars.\"\n\n\"I agree to your proposal,\" she answered.  \"But this diamond is my\nallotted quarry; and any assistance you may render me in procuring it\nwill not, of course, affect in any way our bargain.  On this\npoint\"--she spoke with a break of laughter--\"I am as headstrong as an\nallegory on the banks of the Nile.\"\n\n\"To quote an author to his face,\" lamented Mr. Sheridan, \"is bribery as\ngross as it is efficacious.  I must unwillingly consent to your\nexorbitant demands, for you are, as always, the irresistible Ogle.\"\n\nMiss Ogle bowed her gratitude; and, declining Mr. Sheridan's escort,\nfor fear of arousing gossip by being seen upon the street with him at\nthis late hour, preferred to avoid any appearance of indecorum by\nclimbing down the kitchen roof.\n\n\nWhen she had gone, Mr. Sheridan very gallantly attempted a set of\nverses.  But the Muse was not to be wooed to-night, and stayed\nobstinately coy.\n\nMr. Sheridan reflected, rather forlornly, that he wrote nothing\nnowadays.  There was, of course, his great comedy, _Affectation_, his\nmasterpiece which he meant to finish at one time or another; yet, at\nthe bottom of his heart, he knew that he would never finish it.  But,\nthen, deuce take posterity! for to have written the best comedy, the\nbest farce, and the best burlesque as well, that England had ever\nknown, was a very prodigal wiping-out of every obligation toward\nposterity.  Boys thought a deal about posterity, as he remembered; but\na sensible man would bear in mind that all this world's delicacies--its\nmerry diversions, its venison and old wines, its handsomely-bound books\nand fiery-hearted jewels and sumptuous clothings, all its lovely things\nthat can be touched and handled, and more especially its ear-tickling\napplause--were to be won, if ever, from one's contemporaries.  And\npeople were generous toward social, rather than literary, talents for\nthe sensible reason that they derived more pleasure from an agreeable\ncompanion at dinner than from having a rainy afternoon rendered\nendurable by some book or another.  So the parliamentarian sensibly\nwent to bed.\n\n\nMiss Ogle during this Scottish trip was accompanied by her father, the\nvenerable Dean of Winchester.  The Dean, although in all things worthy\nof implicit confidence, was not next day informed of the intended\nexpedition, in deference to public opinion, which, as Miss Ogle pointed\nout, regards a clergyman's participation in a technical felony with\ndisapproval.\n\nMiss Ogle, therefore, radiant in a becoming gown of pink lute-string,\nleft Edinburgh the following morning under cover of a subterfuge, and\nwith Mr. Sheridan as her only escort.  He was at pains to adorn this\nrole with so many happy touches of courtesy and amiability that their\nconfinement in the postchaise appeared to both of incredible brevity.\n\nWhen they had reached Melrose another chaise was ordered to convey them\nto Bemerside; and pending its forthcoming Mr. Sheridan and Miss Ogle\nstrolled among the famous ruins of Melrose Abbey.  The parliamentarian\nhad caused his hair to be exuberantly curled that morning, and figured\nto advantage in a plum-colored coat and a saffron waistcoat sprigged\nwith forget-me-nots.  He chatted entertainingly concerning the Second\nPointed style of architecture; translated many of the epitaphs; and was\nabundant in interesting information as to Robert Bruce, and Michael\nScott, and the rencounter of Chevy Chase.\n\n\"Oh, but observe,\" said Mr. Sheridan, more lately, \"our only covering\nis the dome of heaven.  Yet in their time these aisles were populous,\nand here a score of generations have besought what earth does not\nafford--now where the banners of crusaders waved the ivy flutters, and\nthere is no incense in this consecrated house except the breath of the\nwild rose.\"\n\n\"The moral is an old one,\" she returned.  \"Mummy is become merchandise,\nMizraim cures wounds, and Pharaoh is sold for balsams.\"\n\n\"You are a reader, madam?\" he observed, with some surprise; and he\ncontinued:  \"Indeed, my thoughts were on another trail.  I was\nconsidering that the demolishers of this place--those English armies,\nthose followers of John Knox--were actuated by the highest and most\nlaudable of motives.  As a result we find the house of Heaven converted\ninto a dustheap.\"\n\n\n\"I believe you attempt an apologue,\" she said, indignantly.  \"Upon my\nword, I think you would insinuate that philanthropy, when forced to\nmanifest itself through embezzlement, is a less womanly employment than\nthe darning of stockings!\"\n\n\"Whom the cap fits----\" he answered, with a bow.  \"Indeed, incomparable\nEsther Jane, I had said nothing whatever touching hosiery; and it was\nequally remote from my intentions to set up as a milliner.\"\n\n\nThey lunched at Bemerside, where Mr. Sheridan was cordially received by\nthe steward, and a well-chosen repast was placed at their disposal.\n\n\"Fergus,\" Mr. Sheridan observed, as they chatted over their dessert\nconcerning famous gems--in which direction talk had been adroitly\nsteered\"--Fergus, since we are on the topic, I would like to show Miss\nOgle the Honor of Eiran.\"\n\nThe Honor of Eiran was accordingly produced from a blue velvet case,\nand was properly admired.  Then, when the steward had been dismissed to\nfetch a rare liqueur, Mr. Sheridan laughed, and tossed and caught the\njewel, as though he handled a cricket-ball.  It was the size of a\npigeon's egg, and was set among eight gems of lesser magnitude; and in\ntransit through the sunlight the trinket flashed and glittered with\ndiabolical beauty.  The parliamentarian placed three bits of sugar in\nthe velvet case and handed the gem to his companion.\n\n\"The bulk is much the same,\" he observed; \"and whether the carbon be\ncrystallized or no, is the responsibility of stratigraphic geology.\nFergus, perhaps, must go to jail.  That is unfortunate.  But true\nphilanthropy works toward the benefit of the greatest number possible;\nand this resplendent pebble will purchase you innumerable pounds of tea\nand a warehouseful of blankets.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Sheridan,\" Miss Ogle cried, in horror, \"to take this brooch\nwould not be honest!\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that----!\" he shrugged.\n\n\"----because Lord Eiran purchased all these lesser diamonds, and very\npossibly paid for them.\"\n\nThen Mr. Sheridan reflected, stood abashed, and said:  \"Incomparable\nEsther Jane, I confess I am only a man.  You are entirely right.  To\npurloin any of these little diamonds would be an abominable action,\nwhereas to make off with the only valuable one is simply a stroke of\nretribution.  I will, therefore, attempt to prise it out with a\nnutpick.\"\n\nThree constables came suddenly into the room.  \"We hae been tauld this\nmissy is a suspectit thieving body,\" their leader cried.  \"Esther Jane\nOgle, ye maun gae with us i' the law's name.  Ou ay, lass, ye ken weel\neneugh wha robbit auld Sir Aleexander McRae, sae dinna ye say naething\ntae your ain preejudice, lest ye hae tae account for it a'.\"\n\nMr. Sheridan rose to the occasion.  \"My exceedingly good friend, Angus\nHowden!  I am unwilling to concede that yeomen can excel in gentlemanly\naccomplishments, but it is only charity to suppose all three of you as\ndrunk as any duke that ever honored me with his acquaintance.\"  This he\ndrawled, and appeared magisterially to await an explanation.\n\n\"Hout, Mr. Sheridan,\" commenced the leading representative of justice,\n\"let that flee stick i' the wa'--e dinna mean tae tell me, Sir, that ye\nare acquaintit wi' this--ou ay, tae pleasure ye, I micht e'en say wi'\nthis----\"\n\n\"This lady, probably?\" Mr. Sheridan hazarded.\n\n\"'Tis an unco thing,\" the constable declared, \"but that wad be the word\nwas amaist at my tongue's tip.\"\n\n\"Why, undoubtedly,\" Mr. Sheridan assented.  \"I rejoice that, being of\nFrench extraction, and unconversant with your somewhat cryptic patois,\nthe lady in question is the less likely to have been sickened by your\nextravagances in the way of misapprehension.  I candidly confess such\nimbecility annoys me.  What!\" he cried out, \"what if I marry! is\nmatrimony to be ranked with arson?  And what if my cousin, Eiran,\naffords me a hiding-place wherein to sneak through our honeymoon after\nthe cowardly fashion of all modern married couples!  Am I in\nconsequence compelled to submit to the invasions of an intoxicated\nconstabulary?\" His rage was terrific.\n\n\"_Voil\u00e0 la seule devise.  Ils me connaissent, ils ont confidence dans\nmoi.  Si, taisez-vous!  Si non, vous serez arret\u00e9e et mise dans la\nprison, comme une caract\u00e8re suspicieuse!_\"  Mr. Sheridan exhorted Miss\nOgle to this intent with more of earnestness than linguistic\nperfection; and he rejoiced to see that instantly she caught at her one\nchance of plausibly accounting for her presence at Bemerside, and of\neffecting a rescue from this horrid situation.\n\n\"But I also spik the English,\" she sprightlily announced.  \"I am\nappleed myself at to learn its by heart.  Certainly you look for a\nneedle in a hay bundle, my gentlemans.  I am no stealer of the grand\nroad, but the wife of Mistaire Sheridan, and her presence will say to\nyou the remains.\"\n\n\"You see!\" cried Mr. Sheridan, in modest triumph.  \"In short, I am a\nbridegroom unwarrantably interrupted in his first _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_, I am\nresponsible for this lady and all her past and its appurtenances; and,\nin a phrase, for everything except the course of conduct I will\nundoubtedly pursue should you be visible at the conclusion of the next\nfive minutes.\"\n\nHis emphasis was such that the police withdrew with a concomitant of\napologies.\n\n\n\"And now I claim my bond,\" said Mr. Sheridan, when they were once again\nfree from intrusion.  \"For we two are in Scotland, where the common\ndeclaration of a man and woman that they are married constitutes a\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"Oh----!\" she exclaimed, and stood encrimsoned.\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess that the day's work has been a trick\nthroughout.  The diamond was pawned years ago.  This trinket here is a\ncopy in paste and worth perhaps some seven shillings sixpence.  And\nthose fellows were not constables, but just my cousin Eiran and two\nfootmen in disguise.  Nay, madam, you will learn with experience that\nto display unfailing candor is not without exception the price of\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"But this, I think, evades our bargain, Mr. Sheridan.  For you were\ncommitted to pilfer property to the value of L10,000----\"\n\n\"And to fulfil the obligation I have stolen your hand in marriage.\nWhat, madam! do you indeed pretend that any person outside of Bedlam\nwould value you at less?  Believe me, your perfections are of far more\nworth.  All persons recognize that save yourself, incomparable Esther\nJane; and yet, so patent is the proof of my contention, I dare to leave\nthe verdict to your sense of justice.\"\n\nMiss Ogle did not speak.  Her lashes fell as, with some ceremony, he\nled her to the long French mirror which was in the breakfast room.\n\"See now!\" said Mr. Sheridan.  \"You, who endanger life and fame in\norder to provide a mendicant with gruel, tracts and blankets!  You, who\ndeny a sop to the one hunger which is vital!  Oh, madam, I am tempted\nglibly to compare your eyes to sapphires, and your hair to thin-spun\ngold, and the color of your flesh to the arbutus-flower--for that, as\nyou can see, would be within the truth, and it would please most women,\nand afterward they would not be so obdurate.  But you are not like\nother women,\" Mr. Sheridan observed, with admirable dexterity.  \"And I\naspire to you, the irresistible Ogle! you, who so great-heartedly\nbefriend the beggar! you, who with such industry contrive alleviation\nfor the discomforts of poverty.  Eh, eh! what will you grant to any\nbeggar such as I?  Will you deny a sop to the one hunger which is\nvital?\"  He spoke with unaccustomed vigor, even in a sort of terror,\nbecause he knew that he was speaking with sincerity.\n\n\"To the one hunger which is vital!\" he repeated.  \"Ah, where lies the\nsecret which makes one face the dearest in the world, and entrusts to\none little hand a life's happiness as a plaything?  All Aristotle's\nlearning could not unriddle the mystery, and Samson's thews were\nimpotent to break that spell.  Love vanquishes all. . . .  You would\nremind me of some previous skirmishings with Venus's unconquerable\nbrat?  Nay, madam, to the contrary, the fact that I have loved many\nother women is my strongest plea for toleration.  Were there nothing\nelse, it is indisputable we perform all actions better for having\nrehearsed them.  No, we do not of necessity perform them the more\nthoughtlessly as well; for, indeed, I find that with experience a man\nbecomes increasingly difficult to please in affairs of the heart.  The\nwoman one loves then is granted that pre-eminence not merely by virtue\nof having outshone any particular one of her predecessors; oh, no!\ninstead, her qualities have been compared with all the charms of all\nher fair forerunners, and they have endured that stringent testing.\nThe winning of an often-bartered heart is in reality the only conquest\nwhich entitles a woman to complacency, for she has received a real\ncompliment; whereas to be selected as the target of a lad's first\ndeclaration is a tribute of no more value than a man's opinion upon\nvintages who has never tasted wine.\"\n\nHe took a turn about the breakfast room, then came near to her.  \"I\nlove you.  Were there any way to parade the circumstance and bedeck it\nwith pleasing adornments of filed phrases, tropes and far-fetched\nsimiles, I would not grudge you a deal of verbal pageantry.  But three\nwords say all.  I love you.  There is no act in my past life but\nappears trivial and strange to me, and to the man who performed it I\nseem no more akin than to Mark Antony or Nebuchadnezzar.  I love you.\nThe skies are bluer since you came, the beauty of this world we live in\noppresses me with a fearful joy, and in my heart there is always the\nthought of you and such yearning as I may not word.  For I love you.\"\n\n\"You--but you have frightened me.\"  Miss Ogle did not seem so terrified\nas to make any effort to recede from him; and yet he saw that she was\nfrightened in sober earnest.  Her face showed pale, and soft, and glad,\nand awed, and desirable above all things; and it remained so near him\nas to engender riotous aspirations.\n\n\"I love you,\" he said again.  You would never have suspected this man\ncould speak, upon occasion, fluently.  \"I think--I think that Heaven\nwas prodigal when Heaven made you.  To think of you is as if I listened\nto an exalted music; and to be with you is to understand that all\nimaginable sorrows are just the figments of a dream which I had very\nlong ago.\"\n\nShe laid one hand on each of his shoulders, facing him.  \"Do not let me\nbe too much afraid!  I have not ever been afraid before.  Oh,\neverything is in a mist of gold, and I am afraid of you, and of the big\nuniverse which I was born into, and I am helpless, and I would have\nnothing changed!  Only, I cannot believe I am worth L10,000, and I do\nso want to be persuaded I am.  It is a great pity,\" she sighed, \"that\nyou who convicted Warren Hastings of stealing such enormous wealth\ncannot be quite as eloquent to-day as you were in the Oudh speech, and\nconvince me his arraigner has been equally rapacious!\"\n\n\"I mean to prove as much--with time,\" said Mr. Sheridan.  His breathing\nwas yet perfunctory.\n\nMiss Ogle murmured, \"And how long would you require?\"\n\n\"Why, I intend, with your permission, to devote the remainder of my\nexistence to the task.  Eh, I concede that space too brief for any\nadequate discussion of the topic; but I will try to be concise and very\npractical----\"\n\nShe laughed.  They were content.  \"Try, then----\" Miss Ogle said.\n\nShe was able to get no farther in the sentence, for reasons which to\nparticularize would be indiscreet.\n\n\n\n\nA PRINCESS OF GRUB STREET\n\n\n\"_Though--or, rather, because--VANDERHOFFEN was a child of the French\nRevolution, and inherited his social, political and religious--or,\nrather, anti-religious--views from the French writers of the eighteenth\ncentury, England was not ready for him and the unshackled individualism\nfor which he at first contended.  Recognizing this fact, he turned to\nan order of writing begotten of the deepest popular needs and addressed\nto the best intelligence of the great middle classes of the community._\"\n\n\n  Now emperors bide their times' rebuff\n  I would not be a king--enough\n      Of woe it is to love;\n  The paths of power are steep and rough,\n      And tempests reign above.\n\n  I would not climb the imperial throne;\n  'Tis built on ice which fortune's sun\n      Thaws in the height of noon.\n  Then farewell, kings, that squeak 'Ha' done!'\n      To time's full-throated tune.\n\n  PAUL VANDERHOFFEN.--_Emma and Caroline_.\n\n\n\n\nA PRINCESS OF GRUB STREET\n\n\nIt is questionable if the announcement of the death of their Crown\nPrince, Hilary, upon the verge of his accession to the throne, aroused\nmore than genteel regret among the inhabitants of Saxe-Kesselberg.  It\nis indisputable that in diplomatic circles news of this horrible\noccurrence was indirectly conceded in 1803 to smack of a direct\nintervention of Providence.  For to consider all the havoc dead Prince\nFribble--such had been his sobriquet--would have created, _Dei gratia_,\nthrough his pilotage of an important grand-duchy (with an area of no\nless than eighty-nine square miles) was less discomfortable now\nprediction was an academic matter.\n\nAnd so the editors of divers papers were the victims of a decorous\nanguish, court-mourning was decreed, and that wreckage which passed for\nthe mutilated body of Prince Hilary was buried with every appropriate\nhonor.  Within the week most people had forgotten him, for everybody\nwas discussing the execution of the Duc d'Enghein.  And the aged\nunvenerable Grand-Duke of Saxe-Kesselberg died too in the same March;\nand afterward his other grandson, Prince Augustus, reigned in the merry\nold debauchee's stead.\n\nPrince Hilary was vastly pleased.  His scheme for evading the tedious\nresponsibilities of sovereignty had been executed without a hitch; he\nwas officially dead; and, on the whole, standing bareheaded between a\nmiller and laundress, he had found his funeral ceremonies to be\nunimpeachably conducted.  He assumed the name of Paul Vanderhoffen,\nselected at random from the novel he was reading when his postchaise\nconveyed him past the frontier of Saxe-Kesselberg.  Freed, penniless,\nand thoroughly content, he set about amusing himself--having a world to\nfrisk in--and incidentally about the furnishing of his new friend Paul\nVanderhoffen with life's necessaries.\n\n\nIt was a little more than two years later that the good-natured Earl of\nBrudenel suggested to Lady John Claridge that she could nowhere find a\nmore eligible tutor for her son than young Vanderhoffen.\n\n\"Hasn't a shilling, ma'am, but one of the most popular men in London.\nHis poetry book was subscribed for by the Prince Regent and half the\nnotables of the kingdom.  Capital company at a dinner-table--stutters,\nbegad, like a What-you-may-call-'em, and keeps everybody in a roar--and\nwhen he's had his whack of claret, he sings his own songs to the piano,\nyou know, and all that sort of thing, and has quite put Tommy Moore's\nnose out of joint.  Nobody knows much about him, but that don't matter\nwith these literary chaps, does it now?  Goes everywhere, ma'am--quite\na favorite at Carlton House--a highly agreeable, well-informed man, I\ncan assure you--and probably hasn't a shilling to pay the cabman.\nDeuced odd, ain't it?  But Lord Lansdowne is trying to get him a\nplace--spoke to me about a tutorship, ma'am, in fact, just to keep\nVanderhoffen going, until some registrarship or other falls vacant.\nNow, I ain't clever and that sort of thing, but I quite agree with\nLansdowne that we practical men ought to look out for these clever\nfellows--see that they don't starve in a garret, like poor\nWhat's-his-name, don't you know?\"\n\nLady Claridge sweetly agreed with her future son-in-law.  So it befell\nthat shortly after this conversation Paul Vanderhoffen came to\nLeamington Manor, and through an entire summer goaded young Percival\nClaridge, then on the point of entering Cambridge, but pedagogically\nbranded as \"deficient in mathematics,\" through many elaborate\ncombinations of x and y and cosines and hyperbolas.\n\nLady John Claridge, mother to the pupil, approved of the new tutor.\nTrue, he talked much and wildishly; but literary men had a name for\neccentricity, and, besides, Lady Claridge always dealt with the\nopinions of other people as matters of illimitable unimportance.  This\nbaronet's lady, in short, was in these days vouchsafing to the universe\nat large a fine and new benevolence, now that her daughter was safely\nengaged to Lord Brudenel, who, whatever his other virtues, was\ncertainly a peer of England and very rich.  It seems irrelevant, and\nyet for the tale's sake is noteworthy, that any room which harbored\nLady John Claridge was through this fact converted into an absolute\nmonarchy.\n\nAnd so, by the favor of Lady Claridge and destiny, the tutor stayed at\nLeamington Manor all summer.\n\nThere was nothing in either the appearance or demeanor of the fiancee\nof Lord Brudenel's title and superabundant wealth which any honest\ngentleman could, hand upon his heart, describe as blatantly repulsive.\n\nIt may not be denied the tutor noted this.  In fine, he fell in love\nwith Mildred Claridge after a thorough-going fashion such as Prince\nFribble would have found amusing.  Prince Fribble would have smiled,\nshrugged, drawled, \"Eh, after all, the girl is handsome and deplorably\ncold-blooded!\"  Paul Vanderhoffen said, \"I am not fit to live in the\nsame world with her,\" and wrote many verses in the prevailing Oriental\nstyle rich in allusions to roses, and bulbuls, and gazelles, and peris,\nand minarets--which he sold rather profitably.\n\nMeanwhile, far oversea, the reigning Duke of Saxe-Kesselberg had been\nunwise enough to quarrel with his Chancellor, Georges Desmarets, an\ninvaluable man whose only faults were dishonesty and a too intimate\nacquaintance with the circumstances of Prince Hilary's demise.  As\nfruit of this indiscretion, an inconsiderable tutor at Leamington\nManor--whom Lady John Claridge regarded as a sort of upper servant was\ntalking with a visitor.\n\n\nThe tutor, it appeared, preferred to talk with the former Chancellor of\nSaxe-Kesselberg in the middle of an open field.  The time was\nafternoon, the season September, and the west was vaingloriously\njustifying the younger man's analogy of a gigantic Spanish omelette.\nMeanwhile, the younger man declaimed in a high-pitched pleasant voice,\nwherein there was, as always, the elusive suggestion of a stutter.\n\n\"I repeat to you,\" the tutor observed, \"that no consideration will ever\nmake a grand-duke of me excepting over my dead body.  Why don't you\nrecommend some not quite obsolete vocation, such as making papyrus, or\nwriting an interesting novel, or teaching people how to dance a\nsaraband?  For after all, what is a monarch nowadays--oh, even a\nmonarch of the first class?\" he argued, with what came near being a\nsqueak of indignation.  \"The poor man is a rather pitiable and\nperfectly useless relic of barbarism, now that 1789 has opened our\neyes; and his main business in life is to ride in open carriages and\nbow to an applauding public who are applauding at so much per head.  He\nmust expect to be aspersed with calumny, and once in a while with\nbullets.  He may at the utmost aspire to introduce an innovation in\nevening dress,--the Prince Regent, for instance, has invented a really\nvery creditable shoe-buckle.  Tradition obligates him to devote his\nunofficial hours to sheer depravity----\"\n\nPaul Vanderhoffen paused to meditate.\n\n\"Why, there you are! another obstacle!  I have in an inquiring spirit\nand without prejudice sampled all the Seven Deadly Sins, and the common\nincrement was an inability to enjoy my breakfast.  A grand-duke I take\nit, if he have any sense of the responsibilities of his position, will\npiously remember the adage about the voice of the people and hasten to\nbe steeped in vice--and thus conform to every popular notion concerning\na grand-duke.  Why, common intelligence demands that a grand-duke\nshould brazenly misbehave himself upon the more conspicuous high-places\nof Chemosh! and personally, I have no talents such as would qualify me\nfor a life of cynical and brutal immorality.  I lack the necessary\naptitude, I would not ever afford any spicy gossip concerning the Duke\nof Saxe-Kesselberg, and the editors of the society papers would\nunanimously conspire to dethrone me----\"\n\nThus he argued, with his high-pitched pleasant voice, wherein there\nwas, as always, the elusive suggestion of a stutter.  And here the\nother interrupted.\n\n\"There is no need of names, your highness.\" Georges Desmarets was\ndiminutive, black-haired and corpulent.  He was of dapper appearance,\npoint-device in everything, and he reminded you of a perky robin.\n\nThe tutor flung out an \"Ouf! I must recall to you that, thank heaven, I\nam not anybody's highness any longer.  I am Paul Vanderhoffen.\"\n\n\"He says that he is not Prince Fribble!\"--the little man addressed the\nzenith--\"as if any other person ever succeeded in talking a half-hour\nwithout being betrayed into at least one sensible remark.  Oh, how do\nyou manage without fail to be so consistently and stupendously idiotic?\"\n\n\"It is, like all other desirable traits, either innate or else just\nunattainable,\" the other answered.  \"I am so hopelessly light-minded\nthat I cannot refrain from being rational even in matters which concern\nme personally--and this, of course, no normal being ever thinks of\ndoing.  I really cannot help it.\"\n\nThe Frenchman groaned whole-heartedly.\n\n\"But we were speaking--well, of foreign countries.  Now, Paul\nVanderhoffen has read that in one of these countries there was once a\nprince who very narrowly escaped figuring as a self-conscious\nabsurdity, as an anachronism, as a life-long prisoner of etiquette.\nHowever, with the assistance of his cousin--who, incidentally, was also\nhis heir--the prince most opportunely died.  Oh, pedant that you are!\nin any event he was interred.  And so, the prince was gathered to his\nfathers, and his cousin Augustus reigned in his stead.  Until a certain\npolitician who had been privy to this pious fraud----\"  The tutor\nshrugged.  \"How can I word it without seeming hypercritical?\"\n\nGeorges Desmarets stretched out appealing hands.  \"But, I protest, it\nwas the narrow-mindedness of that pernicious prig, your cousin--who\nfirmly believes himself to be an improved and augmented edition of the\nFour Evangelists----\"\n\n\"Well, in any event, the proverb was attested that birds of a feather\nmake strange bedfellows.  There was a dispute concerning some petit\nlarceny--some slight discrepancy, we will imagine, since all this is\npure romance, in the politician's accounts----\"\n\n\"Now you belie me----\" said the black-haired man, and warmly.\n\n\"Oh, Desmarets, you are as vain as ever!  Let us say, then, of grand\nlarceny.  In any event, the politician was dismissed.  And what, my\ndears, do you suppose this bold and bad and unprincipled Machiavelli\nwent and did?  Why, he made straight for the father of the princess the\nusurping duke was going to marry, and surprised everybody by showing\nthat, at a pinch, even this Guy Fawkes--who was stuffed with all manner\nof guile and wickedness where youthful patriotism would ordinarily\nincline to straw--was capable of telling the truth.  And so the father\nbroke off the match.  And the enamored, if usurping, duke wept bitterly\nand tore his hair to such an extent he totally destroyed his best\ntoupet.  And privily the Guy Fawkes came into the presence of the\nexiled duke and prated of a restoration to ancestral dignities.  And he\nwas spurned by a certain highly intelligent person who considered it\nboth tedious and ridiculous to play at being emperor of a backyard.\nAnd then--I really don't recall what happened.  But there was a general\nand unqualified deuce to pay with no pitch at a really satisfying\ntemperature.\"\n\nThe stouter man said quietly:  \"It is a thrilling tale which you\nnarrate.  Only, I do recall what happened then.  The usurping duke was\nvery much in earnest, desirous of retaining his little kingdom, and\nparticularly desirous of the woman whom he loved.  In consequence, he\nhad Monsieur the Runaway obliterated while the latter was talking\nnonsense----\"\n\nThe tutor's brows had mounted.\n\n\"I scorn to think it even of anybody who is controlled in every action\nby a sense of duty,\" Georges Desmarets explained, \"that Duke Augustus\nwould cause you to be murdered in your sleep.\"\n\n\"A hit!\"  The younger man unsmilingly gesticulated like one who has\nbeen touched in sword-play.  \"Behold now, as the populace in their\nblunt way would phrase it, I am squelched.\"\n\n\"And so the usurping duke was married and lived happily ever\nafterward.\" Georges Desmarets continued: \"I repeat to you there is only\nthe choice between declaring yourself and being--we will say, removed.\nYour cousin is deeply in love with the Princess Sophia, and thanks to\nme, has now no chance of marrying her until his title has been secured\nby your--removal.  Do not deceive yourself.  High interests are\ninvolved.  You are the grain of sand between big wheels.  I iterate\nthat the footpad who attacked you last night was merely a prologue.  I\nhappen to know your cousin has entrusted the affair to Heinrich\nObendorf, his foster-brother, who, as you will remember, is not\nparticularly squeamish.\"\n\nPaul Vanderhoffen thought a while.  \"Desmarets,\" he said at last, \"it\nis no use.  I scorn your pribbles and your prabbles.  I bargained with\nAugustus.  I traded a duchy for my personal liberty.  Frankly, I would\nbe sorry to connect a sharer of my blood with the assault of yesterday.\nTo be unpardonably candid, I have not ever found that your assertion of\nan event quite proved it had gone through the formality of occurring.\nAnd so I shall hold to my bargain.\"\n\n\"The night brings counsel,\" Desmarets returned.  \"It hardly needs a\nnight, I think, to demonstrate that all I say is true.\"\n\nAnd so they parted.\n\n\nHaving thus dismissed such trifles as statecraft and the well-being of\nempires, Paul Vanderhoffen turned toward consideration of the one\nreally serious subject in the universe, which was of course the bright,\nmiraculous and incredible perfection of Mildred Claridge.\n\n\"I wonder what you think of me?  I wonder if you ever think of me?\" The\nthought careered like a caged squirrel, now that he walked through\nautumn woods toward her home.\n\n\"I wish that you were not so sensible.  I wish your mother were not\neven more so.  The woman reeks with common-sense, and knows that to be\ncommon is to be unanswerable.  I wish that a dispute with her were not\nupon a par with remonstrance against an earthquake.\"\n\nHe lighted a fresh cheroot.  \"And so you are to marry the Brudenel\ntitle and bank account, with this particular Heleigh thrown in as a\ndividend.  And why not? the estate is considerable; the man who\nencumbers it is sincere in his adoration of you; and, chief of all,\nLady John Claridge has decreed it.  And your decision in any matter has\nalways lain between the claws of that steel-armored crocodile who, by\nsome miracle, is your mother.  Oh, what a universe! were I of hasty\ntemperament I would cry out, TUT AND GO TO!\"\n\nThis was the moment which the man hid in the thicket selected as most\nfit for intervention through the assistance of a dueling pistol.  Paul\nVanderhoffen reeled, his face bewilderment.  His hands clutched toward\nthe sky, as if in anguish he grasped at some invisible support, and he\ncoughed once or twice.  It was rather horrible.  Then Vanderhoffen\nshivered as though he were very cold, and tottered and collapsed in the\nparched roadway.\n\nA slinking man whose lips were gray and could not refrain from\ntwitching came toward the limp heap.  \"So----!\" said the man.  One of\nhis hands went to the tutor's breast, and in his left hand dangled a\nsecond dueling pistol.  He had thrown away the other after firing it.\n\n\"And so----!\" observed Paul Vanderhoffen.  Afterward there was a\nmomentary tussle.  Now Paul Vanderhoffen stood erect and flourished the\nloaded pistol.  \"If you go on this way,\" he said, with some severity,\n\"you will presently be neither loved nor respected.  There was a time,\nthough, when you were an excellent shot, Herr Heinrich Obendorf.\"\n\n\"I had my orders, highness,\" said the other stolidly.\n\n\"Oh yes, of course,\" Paul Vanderhoffen answered.  \"You had your\norders--from Augustus!\"  He seemed to think of something very far away.\nHe smiled, with quizzically narrowed eyes such as you may yet see in\nRaeburn's portrait of the man.  \"I was remembering, oddly enough, that\nelm just back of the Canova Pavilion--as it was twenty years ago.  I\nmanaged to scramble up it, but Augustus could not follow me because he\nhad such short fat little legs.  He was so proud of what I had done\nthat he insisted on telling everybody--and afterward we had oranges for\nluncheon, I remember, and sucked them through bits of sugar.  It is not\nfair that you must always remember and always love that boy who played\nwith you when you were little--after he has grown up to be another\nperson.  Eh no!  youth passes, but all its memories of unimportant\nthings remain with you and are less kind than any self-respecting viper\nwould be.  Decidedly, it is not fair, and some earnest-minded person\nought to write to his morning paper about it. . . .  I think that is\nthe reason I am being a sentimental fool,\" Paul Vanderhoffen explained.\n\nThen his teeth clicked.  \"Get on, my man,\" he said.  \"Do not remain too\nnear to me, because there was a time when I loved your employer quite\nas much as you do.  This fact is urging me to dangerous ends.  Yes, it\nis prompting me, even while I talk with you, to give you a lesson in\nmarksmanship, my inconveniently faithful Heinrich.\"\n\nHe shrugged.  He lighted a cheroot with hands whose tremblings, he\ndevoutly hoped, were not apparent, for Prince Fribble had been ashamed\nto manifest a sincere emotion of any sort, and Paul Vanderhoffen shared\nas yet this foible.\n\n\"Oh Brutus!  Ravaillac!  Damiens!\" he drawled.  \"O general compendium\nof misguided aspirations! do be a duck and get along with you.  And I\nwould run as hard as I could, if I were you, for it is war now, and you\nand I are not on the same side.\"\n\n\nPaul Vanderhoffen paused a hundred yards or so from this to shake his\nhead.  \"Come, come! I have lost so much that I cannot afford to throw\nmy good temper into the bargain.  To endure with a grave face this\nperfectly unreasonable universe wherein destiny has locked me is\nundoubtedly meritorious; but to bustle about it like a caged canary,\nand not ever to falter in your hilarity, is heroic.  Let us, by all\nmeans, not consider the obdurate if gilded barriers, but rather the\nlettuce and the cuttle-bone.  I have my choice between becoming a\ncorpse or a convict--a convict? ah, undoubtedly a convict, sentenced to\nserve out a life-term in a cess-pool of castby superstitions.\"\n\nHe smiled now over Paul Vanderhoffen's rage.  \"Since the situation is\ntragic, let us approach it in an appropriate spirit of frivolity.  My\ncircumstances bully me.  And I succumb to irrationality, as rational\npersons invariably end by doing.  But, oh, dear me! oh, Osiris,\nTermagaunt, and Zeus! to think there are at least a dozen other\nne'er-do-wells alive who would prefer to make a mess of living as a\ngrand-duke rather than as a scribbler in Grub Street!  Well, well! the\njest is not of my contriving, and the one concession a sane man will\nnever yield the universe is that of considering it seriously.\"\n\nAnd he strode on, resolved to be Prince Fribble to the last.\n\n\"Frivolity,\" he said, \"is the smoked glass through which a civilized\nperson views the only world he has to live in.  For, otherwise, he\ncould not presume to look upon such coruscations of insanity and remain\nunblinded.\"\n\nThis heartened him, as a rounded phrase will do the best of us.  But\nby-and-bye,\n\n\"Frivolity,\" he groaned, \"is really the cheap mask incompetence claps\non when haled before a mirror.\"\n\n\nAnd at Leamington Manor he found her strolling upon the lawn.  It was\nan ordered, lovely scene, steeped now in the tranquillity of evening.\nAbove, the stars were losing diffidence.  Below, and within arms'\nreach, Mildred Claridge was treading the same planet on which he\nfidgeted and stuttered.\n\nSomething in his heart snapped like a fiddle-string, and he was\nentirely aware of this circumstance.  As to her eyes, teeth, coloring,\ncomplexion, brows, height and hair, it is needless to expatiate.  The\nmost painstaking inventory of these chattels would necessarily be\nmisleading, because the impression which they conveyed to him was that\nof a bewildering, but not distasteful, transfiguration of the universe,\napt as a fanfare at the entrance of a queen.\n\nBut he would be Prince Fribble to the last.  And so, \"Wait just a\nmoment, please,\" he said, \"I want to harrow up your soul and freeze\nyour blood.\"\n\nWherewith he suavely told her everything about Paul Vanderhoffen's\norigin and the alternatives now offered him, and she listened without\ncomment.\n\n\"Ai! ai!\" young Vanderhoffen perorated; \"the situation is complete.  I\nhave not the least desire to be Grand-Duke of Saxe-Kesselberg.  It is\ntoo abominably tedious.  But, if I do not join in with Desmarets, who\nhas the guy-ropes of a restoration well in hand, I must inevitably\nbe--removed, as the knave phrases it.  For as long as I live, I will be\nan insuperable barrier between Augustus and his Sophia.  Otototoi!\" he\nwailed, with a fine tone of tragedy, \"the one impossible achievement in\nmy life has always been to convince anybody that it was mine to dispose\nof as I elected!\"\n\n\"Oh, man proposes----\" she began, cryptically.  Then he deliberated,\nand sulkily submitted:  \"But I may not even propose to abdicate.\nAugustus has put himself upon sworn record as an eye-witness of my\nhideous death.  And in consequence I might keep on abdicating from now\nto the crack of doom, and the only course left open to him would be to\ntreat me as an impostor.\"\n\nShe replied, with emphasis, \"I think your cousin is a beast!\"\n\n\"Ah, but the madman is in love,\" he pleaded.  \"You should not judge\npoor masculinity in such a state by any ordinary standards.  Oh really,\nyou don't know the Princess Sophia.  She is, in sober truth, the nicest\nperson who was ever born a princess.  Why, she had actually made a mock\nof even that handicap, for ordinarily it is as disastrous to feminine\nappearance as writing books.  And, oh, Lord! they will be marrying her\nto me, if Desmarets and I win out.\"  Thus he forlornly ended.\n\n\"The designing minx!\" Miss Claridge said, distinctly.\n\n\"Now, gracious lady, do be just a cooing pigeon and grant that when men\nare in love they are not any more encumbered by abstract notions about\nhonor than if they had been womanly from birth.  Come, let's be lyrical\nand open-minded,\" he urged; and he added, \"No, either you are in love\nor else you are not in love.  And nothing else will matter either way.\nYou see, if men and women had been primarily designed to be rational\ncreatures, there would be no explanation for their being permitted to\ncontinue in existence,\" he lucidly explained.  \"And to have grasped\nthis fact is the pith of all wisdom.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am very wise.\"  A glint of laughter shone in her eyes.  \"I would\nclaim to be another Pythoness if only it did not sound so snaky and\nwriggling.  So, from my trident--or was it a Triton they used to stand\non?--I announce that you and your Augustus are worrying yourselves\ngray-headed over an idiotically simple problem.  Now, I disposed of it\noffhand when I said, 'Man proposes.'\"\n\nHe seemed to be aware of some one who from a considerable distance was\ninquiring her reasons for this statement.\n\n\"Because in Saxe-Kesselberg, as in all other German states, when a\nprince of the reigning house marries outside of the mediatized nobility\nhe thereby forfeits his right of succession.  It has been done any\nnumber of times.  Why, don't you see, Mr. Vanderhoffen?  Conceding you\never do such a thing, your cousin Augustus would become at once the\nlegal heir.  So you must marry.  It is the only way, I think, to save\nyou from regal incarceration and at the same time to reassure the\nPrince of Lueminster--that creature's father--that you have not, and\nnever can have, any claim which would hold good in law.  Then Duke\nAugustus could peaceably espouse his Sophia and go on reigning---- And,\nby the way, I have seen her picture often, and if that is what you call\nbeauty----\" Miss Claridge did not speak this last at least with any air\nof pointing out the self-evident.\n\nAnd, \"I believe,\" he replied, \"that all this is actually happening.  I\nmight have known fate meant to glut her taste for irony.\"\n\n\"But don't you see?  You have only to marry anybody outside of the\nhigher nobility--and just as a makeshift----\"  She had drawn closer in\nthe urgency of her desire to help him.  An infinite despair and mirth\nas well was kindled by her nearness.  And the man was insane and dimly\nknew as much.\n\nAnd so, \"I see,\" he answered.  \"But, as it happens, I cannot marry any\nwoman, because I love a particular woman.  At least, I suppose she\nisn't anything but just a woman.  That statement,\" he announced, \"is a\nformal tribute paid by what I call my intellect to what the vulgar call\nthe probabilities.  The rest of me has no patience whatever with such\nidiotic blasphemy.\"\n\nShe said, \"I think I understand.\"  And this surprised him, coming as it\ndid from her whom he had always supposed to be the fiancee of Lord\nBrudenel's title and bank-account.\n\n\"And, well!\"--he waved his hands--\"either as tutor or as grand-duke,\nthis woman is unattainable, because she has been far too carefully\nreared\"--and here he frenziedly thought of that terrible matron whom,\nas you know, he had irreverently likened to a crocodile--\"either to\nmarry a pauper or to be contented with a left-handed alliance.  And I\nlove her.  And so\"--he shrugged--\"there is positively nothing left to\ndo save sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the deaths of\nkings.\"\n\nShe said, \"Oh, and you mean it!  You are speaking the plain truth!\"  A\nchange had come into her lovely face which would have made him think it\neven lovelier had not that contingency been beyond conception.\n\nAnd Mildred Claridge said, \"It is not fair for dreamers such as you to\nlet a woman know just how he loves her.  That is not wooing.  It is\nbullying.\"\n\nHis lips were making a variety of irrational noises.  And he was near\nto her.  Also he realized that he had never known how close akin were\nfear and joy, so close the two could mingle thus, and be quite\nundistinguishable.  And then repentance smote him.\n\n\"I am contemptible!\" he groaned.  \"I had no right to trouble you with\nmy insanities.  Indeed I had not ever meant to let you guess how mad I\nwas.  But always I have evaded my responsibilities.  So I remain Prince\nFribble to the last.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I knew, I have always known.\"  She held her eyes away from\nhim.  \"And I wrote to Lord Brudenel only yesterday releasing him from\nhis engagement.\"\n\nAnd now without uncertainty or haste Paul Vanderhoffen touched her\ncheek and raised her face, so that he saw it plainly in the rising\ntwilight, and all its wealth of tenderness newborn.  And what he saw\nthere frightened him.\n\nFor the girl loved him!  He felt himself to be, as most men do, a\nswindler when he comprehended this preposterous fact; and, in addition,\nhe thought of divers happenings, such as shipwrecks, holocausts and\nearthquakes, which might conceivably have appalled him, and understood\nthat he would never in his life face any sense of terror as huge as was\nthis present sweet and illimitable awe.\n\nAnd then he said, \"You know that what I hunger for is impossible.\nThere are so many little things, like common-sense, to be considered.\nFor this is just a matter which concerns you and Paul Vanderhoffen--a\nliterary hack, a stuttering squeak-voiced ne'er-do-well, with an\nacquired knack for scribbling verses that are feeble-minded enough for\nAnnuals and Keepsake Books, and so fetch him an occasional guinea.\nFor, my dear, the verses I write of my own accord are not sufficiently\ngenteel to be vended in Paternoster Row; they smack too dangerously of\nhuman intelligence.  So I am compelled, perforce, to scribble such\njingles as I am ashamed to read, because I must write\n_something_. . . .\" Paul Vanderhoffen shrugged, and continued, in tones\nmore animated: \"There will be no talk of any grand-duke.  Instead,\nthere will be columns of denunciation and tittle-tattle in every\nnewspaper--quite as if you, a baronet's daughter, had run away with a\nfootman.  And you will very often think wistfully of Lord Brudenel's\nfine house when your only title is--well, Princess of Grub Street, and\nyour realm is a garret.  And for a while even to-morrow's breakfast\nwill be a problematical affair.  It is true Lord Lansdowne has promised\nme a registrarship in the Admiralty Court, and I do not think he will\nfail me.  But that will give us barely enough to live on--with strict\neconomy, which is a virtue that neither of us knows anything about.  I\nbeg you to remember that--you who have been used to every luxury!  you\nwho really were devised that you might stand beside an emperor and set\ntasks for him.  In fine, you know----\"\n\nAnd Mildred Claridge said, \"I know that, quite as I observed, man\nproposes--when he has been sufficiently prodded by some one who,\nbecause she is an idiot--And that is why I am not blushing--very\nmuch----\"\n\n\"Your coloring is not--repellent.\"  His high-pitched pleasant voice, in\nspite of him, shook now with more than its habitual suggestion of a\nstutter.  \"What have you done to me, my dear?\" he said.  \"Why can't I\njest at this . . . as I have always done at everything----?\"\n\n\"Boy, boy!\" she said; \"laughter is excellent.  And wisdom too is\nexcellent.  Only I think that you have laughed too much, and I have\nbeen too shrewd--But now I know that it is better to be a princess in\nGrub Street than to figure at Ranelagh as a good-hearted fool's latest\npurchase.  For Lord Brudenel is really very good-natured,\" she argued,\n\"and I did like him, and mother was so set upon it--and he was\nrich--and I honestly thought----\"\n\n\"And now?\" he said.\n\n\"And now I know,\" she answered happily.\n\nThey looked at each other for a little while.  Then he took her hand,\nprepared in turn for self-denial.\n\n\"The _Household Review_ wants me to 'do' a series on famous English\nbishops,\" he reported, humbly.  \"I had meant to refuse, because it\nwould all have to be dull High-Church twaddle.  And the _English\nGentleman_ wants some rather outrageous lying done in defense of the\nCorn Laws.  You would not despise me too much--would you, Mildred?--if\nI undertook it now.  I really have no choice.  And there is plenty of\nhackwork of that sort available to keep us going until more solvent\ndays, when I shall have opportunity to write something quite worthy of\nyou.\"\n\n\"For the present, dear, it would be much more sensible, I think, to\n'do' the bishops and the Corn Laws.  You see, that kind of thing pays\nvery well, and is read by the best people; whereas poetry, of course--\nBut you can always come back to the verse-making, you know----\"\n\n\"If you ever let me,\" he said, with a flash of prescience.  \"And I\ndon't believe you mean to let me.  You are your mother's daughter,\nafter all!  Nefarious woman, you are planning, already, to make a\nresponsible member of society out of me! and you will do it,\nruthlessly!  Such is to be Prince Fribble's actual burial--in his own\nprivate carriage, with a receipted tax-bill in his pocket!\"\n\n\"What nonsense you poets talk!\" the girl observed.  But to him,\nforebodingly, that familiar statement seemed to lack present\napplication.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LADY OF ALL OUR DREAMS\n\n\n\"_In JOHN CHARTERIS appeared a man with an inborn sense of the supreme\ninterest and the overwhelming emotional and spiritual relevancy of\nhuman life as it is actually and obscurely lived; a man with\nunmistakable creative impulses and potentialities; a man who, had he\nlived in a more mature and less self-deluding community--a community\nthat did not so rigorously confine its interest in facts to business,\nand limit its demands upon art to the supplying of illusions--might\nhumbly and patiently have schooled his gifts to the service of his\nvision. . . .  As it was, he accepted defeat and compromised\nhalf-heartedly with commercialism._\"\n\n\n\n  And men unborn will read of Heloise,\n      And Ruth, and Rosamond, and Semele,\n      When none remembers your name's melody\n  Or rhymes your name, enregistered with these.\n\n  And will my name wake moods as amorous\n      As that of Abelard or Launcelot\n  Arouses? be recalled when Pyramus\n      And Tristram are unrhymed of and forgot?--\n  Time's laughter answers, who accords to us\n      More gracious fields, wherein we harvest--what?\n\n  JOHN CHARTERIS. _Torrismond's Envoi, in Ashtaroth's Lackey_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LADY OF ALL OUR DREAMS\n\n\n\"Our distinguished alumnus,\" after being duly presented as such, had\nwith vivacity delivered much the usual sort of Commencement Address.\nYet John Charteris was in reality a trifle fagged.\n\nThe afternoon train had been vexatiously late.  The little novelist had\nfound it tedious to interchange inanities with the committee awaiting\nhim at the Pullman steps.  Nor had it amused him to huddle into\nevening-dress, and hasten through a perfunctory supper in order to\nreassure his audience at half-past eight precisely as to the\nunmitigated delight of which he was now conscious.\n\nNevertheless, he alluded with enthusiasm to the arena of life, to the\ndependence of America's destiny upon the younger generation, to the\nenviable part King's College had without exception played in history,\nand he depicted to Fairhaven the many glories of Fairhaven--past,\npresent and approaching--in superlatives that would hardly have seemed\ninadequate if applied to Paradise.  His oration, in short, was of a\npiece with the amiable bombast that the college students and Fairhaven\nat large were accustomed to applaud at every Finals--the sort of\nlinguistic debauch that John Charteris himself remembered to have\napplauded as an undergraduate more years ago than he cared to\nacknowledge.\n\nPauline Romeyne had sat beside him then--yonder, upon the fourth bench\nfrom the front, where now another boy with painstakingly plastered hair\nwas clapping hands.  There was a girl on the right of this boy, too.\nThere naturally would be.  Mr. Charteris as he sat down was wondering\nif Pauline was within reach of his voice?  and if she were, what was\nher surname nowadays?\n\nThen presently the exercises were concluded, and the released auditors\narose with an outwelling noise of multitudinous chatter, of shuffling\nfeet, of rustling programs.  Many of Mr. Charteris' audience, though,\nwere contending against the general human outflow and pushing toward\nthe platform, for Fairhaven was proud of John Charteris now that his\ncolorful tales had risen, from the semi-oblivion of being cherished\nmerely by people who cared seriously for beautiful things, to the\ndistinction of being purchasable in railway stations; so that, in\nconsequence, Fairhaven wished both to congratulate him and to renew\nacquaintanceship.\n\nHe, standing there, alert and quizzical, found it odd to note how\nunfamiliar beaming faces climbed out of the hurly-burly of retreating\nbacks, to say, \"Don't you remember me?  I'm so-and-so.\"  These were the\npeople whom he had lived among once, and some of these had once been\npeople whom he loved.  Now there was hardly any one whom at a glance he\nwould have recognized.\n\nNobody guessed as much.  He was adjudged to be delightful, cordial,\n\"and not a bit stuck-up, not spoiled at all, you know.\"  To appear this\nwas the talisman with which he banteringly encountered the universe.\n\nBut John Charteris, as has been said, was in reality a trifle fagged.\nWhen everybody had removed to the Gymnasium, where the dancing was to\nbe, and he had been delightful there, too, for a whole half-hour, he\ngrasped with avidity at his first chance to slip away, and did so under\ncover of a riotous two-step.\n\nHe went out upon the Campus.\n\nHe found this lawn untenanted, unless you chose to count the marble\nfigure of Lord Penniston, made aerial and fantastic by the moonlight,\nstanding as it it were on guard over the College.  Mr. Charteris chose\nto count him.  Whimsically, Mr. Charteris reflected that this battered\nnobleman's was the one familiar face he had exhumed in all Fairhaven.\nAnd what a deal of mirth and folly, too, the old fellow must have\nwitnessed during his two hundred and odd years of sentry-duty!  On\nwarm, clear nights like this, in particular, when by ordinary there\nwere only couples on the Campus, each couple discreetly remote from any\nof the others.  Then Penniston would be aware of most portentous pauses\n(which a delectable and lazy conference of leaves made eloquent)\nbecause of many unfinished sentences.  \"Oh, YOU know what I mean,\ndear!\" one would say as a last resort.  And she-why, bless her heart!\nof course, she always did. . . .  Heigho, youth's was a pleasant\nlunacy. . . .\n\nThus Charteris reflected, growing drowsy.  She said, \"You spoke very\nwell to-night.  Is it too late for congratulations?\"\n\nTurning, Mr. Charteris remarked, \"As you are perfectly aware, all that\nI vented was just a deal of skimble-scamble stuff, a verbal syllabub of\nbalderdash.  No, upon reflection, I think I should rather describe it\nas a conglomeration of piffle, patriotism and pyrotechnics.  Well,\nMadam Do-as-you-would-be-done-by, what would you have?  You must give\npeople what they want.\"\n\nIt was characteristic that he faced Pauline Romeyne--or was it still\nRomeyne? he wondered--precisely as if it had been fifteen minutes,\nrather than as many years, since they had last spoken together.\n\n\"Must one?\" she asked.  \"Oh, yes, I know you have always thought that,\nbut I do not quite see the necessity of it.\"\n\nShe sat upon the bench beside Lord Penniston's square marble pedestal.\n\"And all the while you spoke I was thinking of those Saturday nights\nwhen your name was up for an oration or a debate before the Eclectics,\nand you would stay away and pay the fine rather than brave an audience.\"\n\n\"The tooth of Time,\" he reminded her, \"has since then written wrinkles\non my azure brow.  The years slip away fugacious, and Time that brings\nforth her children only to devour them grins most hellishly, for Time\nchanges all things and cultivates even in herself an appreciation of\nirony,--and, therefore, why shouldn't I have changed a trifle?  You\nwouldn't have me put on exhibition as a _lusus naturae_?\"\n\n\"Oh, but I wish you had not altered so entirely!\" Pauline sighed.\n\n\"At least, you haven't,\" he declared.  \"Of course, I would be compelled\nto say so, anyhow.  But in this happy instance courtesy and veracity\ncome skipping arm-in-arm from my elated lips.\"  And, indeed, it seemed\nto him that Pauline was marvelously little altered.  \"I wonder now,\" he\nsaid, and cocked his head, \"I wonder now whose wife I am talking to?\"\n\n\"No, Jack, I never married,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"It is selfish of me,\" he said, in the same tone, \"but I am glad of\nthat.\"\n\nAnd so they sat a while, each thinking.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Pauline, with that small plaintive voice which\nCharteris so poignantly remembered, \"whether it is always like this?\nOh, do the Overlords of Life and Death ALWAYS provide some obstacle to\nprevent what all of us have known in youth was possible from ever\ncoming true?\"\n\nAnd again there was a pause which a delectable and lazy conference of\nleaves made eloquent.\n\n\"I suppose it is because they know that if it ever did come true, we\nwould be gods like them.\"  The ordinary associates of John Charteris,\nmost certainly, would not have suspected him to be the speaker.  \"So\nthey contrive the obstacle, or else they send false dreams--out of the\ngates of horn--and make the path smooth, very smooth, so that two\ndreamers may not be hindered on their way to the divorce-courts.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are jealous gods! oh, and ironical gods also!  They grant\nthe Dream, and chuckle while they grant it, I think, because they know\nthat later they will be bringing their playthings face to face--each\nmarried, fat, inclined to optimism, very careful of decorum, and\nperfectly indifferent to each other.  And then they get their\nfore-planned mirth, these Overlords of Life and Death.  'We gave you,'\nthey chuckle, 'the loveliest and greatest thing infinity contains.  And\nyou bartered it because of a clerkship or a lying maxim or perhaps a\nfinger-ring.'  I suppose that they must laugh a great deal.\"\n\n\"Eh, what?  But then you never married?\"  For masculinity in argument\nstarts with the word it has found distasteful.\n\n\"Why, no.\"\n\n\"Nor I.\"  And his tone implied that the two facts conjoined proved much.\n\n\"Miss Willoughby----?\" she inquired.\n\nNow, how in heaven's name, could a cloistered Fairhaven have surmised\nhis intention of proposing on the first convenient opportunity to\nhandsome, well-to-do Anne Willoughby?  He shrugged his wonder off.\n\"Oh, people will talk, you know.  Let any man once find a woman has a\ntongue in her head, and the stage-direction is always 'Enter Rumor,\npainted full of tongues.'\"\n\nPauline did not appear to have remarked his protest.  \"Yes,--in the end\nyou will marry her.  And her money will help, just as you have\ncontrived to make everything else help, toward making John Charteris\ncomfortable.  She is not very clever, but she will always worship you,\nand so you two will not prove uncongenial.  That is your real tragedy,\nif I could make you comprehend.\"\n\n\"So I am going to develop into a pig,\" he said, with relish,--\"a\nlovable, contented, unambitious porcine, who is alike indifferent to\nthe Tariff, the importance of Equal Suffrage and the market-price of\nhams, for all that he really cares about is to have his sty as\ncomfortable as may be possible.  That is exactly what I am going to\ndevelop into,--now, isn't it?\"  And John Charteris, sitting, as was his\nhabitual fashion, with one foot tucked under him, laughed cheerily.\nOh, just to be alive (he thought) was ample cause for rejoicing! and\nhow deliciously her eyes, alert with slumbering fires, were peering\nthrough the moon-made shadows of her brows!\n\n\"Well----! something of the sort.\" Pauline was smiling, but\nrestrainedly, and much as a woman does in condoning the naughtiness of\nher child.  \"And, oh, if only----\"\n\n\"Why, precisely.  'If only!' quotha.  Why, there you word the key-note,\nyou touch the cornerstone, you ruthlessly illuminate the mainspring, of\nan intractable unfeeling universe.  For instance, if only\n\n  You were the Empress of Ayre and Skye,\n      And I were Ahkond of Kong,\n  We could dine every day on apple-pie,\n  And peddle potatoes, and sleep in a sty,\n  And people would say when we came to die,\n  'They _never_ did anything wrong.'\n\nBut, as it is, our epitaphs will probably be nothing of the sort.  So\nthat there lurks, you see, much virtue in this 'if only.'\"\n\nImpervious to nonsense, she asked, \"And have I not earned the right to\nlament that you are changed?\"\n\n\"I haven't robbed more than six churches up to date,\" he grumbled.\n\"What would you have?\"\n\nThe answer came, downright, and, as he knew, entirely truthful:  \"I\nwould have had you do all that you might have done.\"\n\nBut he must needs refine.  \"Why, no--you would have made me do it,\nwrung out the last drop.  You would have bullied me and shamed me into\nbeing all that I might have been.  I see that now.\"  He spoke as if in\nwonder, with quickening speech.  \"Pauline, I haven't been entirely not\nworth while.  Oh, yes, I know!  I know I haven't written five-act\ntragedies which would be immortal, as you probably expected me to do.\nMy books are not quite the books I was to write when you and I were\nyoung.  But I have made at worst some neat, precise and joyous little\ntales which prevaricate tenderly about the universe and veil the\npettiness of human nature with screens of verbal jewelwork.  It is not\nthe actual world they tell about, but a vastly superior place where the\nDream is realized and everything which in youth we knew was possible\ncomes true.  It is a world we have all glimpsed, just once, and have\nnot ever entered, and have not ever forgotten.  So people like my\nlittle tales. . . .  Do they induce delusions?  Oh, well, you must give\npeople what they want, and literature is a vast bazaar where customers\ncome to purchase everything except mirrors.\"\n\nShe said soberly, \"You need not make a jest of it.  It is not\nridiculous that you write of beautiful and joyous things because there\nwas a time when living was really all one wonderful adventure, and you\nremember it.\"\n\n\"But, oh, my dear, my dear! such glum discussions are so sadly\nout-of-place on such a night as this,\" he lamented.  \"For it is a night\nof pearl-like radiancies and velvet shadows and delicate odors and big\nfriendly stars that promise not to gossip, whatever happens.  It is a\nnight that hungers, and all its undistinguishable little sounds are\nvoicing the night's hunger for masks and mandolins, for rope-ladders\nand balconies and serenades.  It is a night . . . a night wherein I\ngratefully remember so many beautiful sad things that never\nhappened . . . to John Charteris, yet surely happened once upon a time\nto me . . .\"\n\n\"I think that I know what it is to remember--better than you do, Jack.\nBut what do you remember?\"\n\n\"In faith, my dear, the most Bedlamitish occurrences!  It is a night\nthat breeds deplorable insanities, I warn you.  For I seem to remember\nhow I sat somewhere, under a peach-tree, in clear autumn weather, and\nwas content; but the importance had all gone out of things; and even\nyou did not seem very important, hardly worth lying to, as I spoke\nlightly of my wasted love for you, half in hatred, and--yes, still half\nin adoration.  For you were there, of course.  And I remember how I\ncame to you, in a sinister and brightly lighted place, where a\nhorrible, staring frail old man lay dead at your feet; and you had\nmurdered him; and heaven did not care, and we were old, and all our\nlives seemed just to end in futile tangle-work.  And, again, I remember\nhow we stood alone, with visible death crawling lazily toward us, as a\nbig sullen sea rose higher and higher; and we little tinseled creatures\nwaited, helpless, trapped and yearning. . . .  There is a boat in that\npicture; I suppose it was deeply laden with pirates coming to slit our\nthroats from ear to ear.  I have forgotten that part, but I remember\nthe tiny spot of courtplaster just above your painted lips. . . .  Such\nare the jumbled pictures.  They are bred of brain-fag, no doubt; yet,\nwhatever be their lineage,\" said Charteris, happily, \"they render glum\ndiscussion and platitudinous moralizing quite out of the question.  So,\nlet's pretend, Pauline, that we are not a bit more worldly-wise than\nthose youngsters who are frisking yonder in the Gymnasium--for, upon my\nword, I dispute if we have ever done anything to suggest that we are.\nDon't let's be cowed a moment longer by those bits of paper with\nfigures on them which our too-credulous fellow-idiots consider to be\nthe only almanacs.  Let's have back yesterday, let's tweak the nose of\nTime intrepidly.\" Then Charteris caroled:\n\n  \"For Yesterday! for Yesterday!\n  I cry a reward for a Yesterday\n  Now lost or stolen or gone astray,\n  With all the laughter of Yesterday!\"\n\n\n\"And how slight a loss was laughter,\" she murmured--still with the\nvague and gentle eyes of a day-dreamer--\"as set against all that we\nnever earned in youth, and so will never earn.\"\n\nHe inadequately answered \"Bosh!\" and later, \"Do you remember----?\" he\nbegan.\n\nYes, she remembered that, it developed.  And \"Do you remember----?\" she\nin turn was asking later.  It was to seem to him in retrospection that\nneither for the next half-hour began a sentence without this formula.\nIt was as if they sought to use it as a master-word wherewith to\nreanimate the happinesses and sorrows of their common past, and as if\nthey found the charm was potent to awaken the thin, powerless ghosts of\nemotions that were once despotic.  For it was as if frail shadows and\nhalf-caught echoes were all they could evoke, it seemed to Charteris;\nand yet these shadows trooped with a wild grace, and the echoes\nthrilled him with the sweet and piercing surprise of a bird's call at\nmidnight or of a bugle heard in prison.\n\nThen twelve o'clock was heralded by the College bell, and Pauline arose\nas though this equable deep-throated interruption of the music's levity\nhad been a signal.  John Charteris saw her clearly now; and she was\nbeautiful.\n\n\"I must go.  You will not ever quite forget me, Jack.  Such is my sorry\ncomfort.\"  It seemed to Charteris that she smiled as in mockery, and\nyet it was a very tender sort of derision.  \"Yes, you have made your\nbooks.  You have done what you most desired to do.  You have got all\nfrom life that you have asked of life.  Oh, yes, you have got much from\nlife.  One prize, though, Jack, you missed.\"\n\nHe, too, had risen, quiet and perfectly sure of himself.  \"I haven't\nmissed it.  For you love me.\"\n\nThis widened her eyes.  \"Did I not always love you, Jack?  Yes, even\nwhen you went away forever, and there were no letters, and the days\nwere long.  Yes, even knowing you, I loved you, John Charteris.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was wrong, all wrong,\" he cried; \"and yet there is something to\nbe said upon the other side, as always. . . .\"  Now Charteris was still\nfor a while.  The little man's chin was uplifted so that it was toward\nthe stars he looked rather than at Pauline Romeyne, and when he spoke\nhe seemed to meditate aloud.  \"I was born, I think, with the desire to\nmake beautiful books--brave books that would preserve the glories of\nthe Dream untarnished, and would re-create them for battered people,\nand re-awaken joy and magnanimity.\"  Here he laughed, a little\nruefully.  \"No, I do not think I can explain this obsession to any one\nwho has never suffered from it.  But I have never in my life permitted\nanything to stand in the way of my fulfilling this desire to serve the\nDream by re-creating it for others with picked words, and that has cost\nme something.  Yes, the Dream is an exacting master.  My books, such as\nthey are, have been made what they are at the dear price of never\npermitting myself to care seriously for anything else.  I might not\ndare to dissipate my energies by taking any part in the drama I was\nattempting to re-write, because I must so jealously conserve all the\nforce that was in me for the perfection of my lovelier version.  That\nmay not be the best way of making books, but it is the only one that\nwas possible for me.  I had so little natural talent, you see,\" said\nCharteris, wistfully, \"and I was anxious to do so much with it.  So I\nhad always to be careful.  It has been rather lonely, my dear.  Now,\nlooking back, it seems to me that the part I have played in all other\npeople's lives has been the role of a tourist who enters a cafe\nchantant, a fortress, or a cathedral, with much the same forlorn sense\nof detachment, and observes what there is to see that may be worth\nremembering, and takes a note or two, perhaps, and then leaves the\nplace forever.  Yes, that is how I served the Dream and that is how I\ngot my books.  They are very beautiful books, I think, but they cost me\nfifteen years of human living and human intimacy, and they are hardly\nworth so much.\"\n\nHe turned to her, and his voice changed.  \"Oh, I was wrong, all wrong,\nand chance is kindlier than I deserve.  For I have wandered after\nunprofitable gods, like a man blundering through a day of mist and fog,\nand I win home now in its golden sunset.  I have laughed very much, my\ndear, but I was never happy until to-night.  The Dream, as I now know,\nis not best served by making parodies of it, and it does not greatly\nmatter after all whether a book be an epic or a directory.  What really\nmatters is that there is so much faith and love and kindliness which we\ncan share with and provoke in others, and that by cleanly, simple,\ngenerous living we approach perfection in the highest and most lovely\nof all arts. . . .  But you, I think, have always comprehended this.\nMy dear, if I were worthy to kneel and kiss the dust you tread in I\nwould do it.  As it happens, I am not worthy.  Pauline, there was a\ntime when you and I were young together, when we aspired, when life\npassed as if it were to the measures of a noble music--a\nheart-wringing, an obdurate, an intolerable music, it might be, but\nalways a lofty music.  One strutted, no doubt--it was because one knew\noneself to be indomitable.  Eh, it is true I have won all I asked of\nlife, very horribly true.  All that I asked, poor fool! oh, I am weary\nof loneliness, and I know now that all the phantoms I have raised are\nonly colorless shadows which belie the Dream, and they are hateful to\nme.  I want just to recapture that old time we know of, and we two\nalone.  I want to know the Dream again, Pauline,--the Dream which I had\nlost, had half forgotten, and have so pitifully parodied.  I want to\nknow the Dream again, Pauline, and you alone can help me.\"\n\n\"Oh, if I could! if even I could now, my dear!\" Pauline Romeyne left\nhim upon a sudden, crying this.  And  \"So!\" said Mr. Charteris.\n\nHe had been deeply shaken and very much in earnest; but he was never\nthe man to give for any lengthy while too slack a rein to emotion; and\nso he now sat down upon the bench and lighted a cigarette and smiled.\nYet he fully recognized himself to be the most enviable of men and an\ninhabitant of the most glorious world imaginable--a world wherein he\nvery assuredly meant to marry Pauline Romeyne say, in the ensuing\nSeptember.  Yes, that would fit in well enough, although, of course, he\nwould have to cancel the engagement to lecture in Milwaukee. . . .  How\nlucky, too, it was that he had never actually committed himself with\nAnne Willoughby! for while money was an excellent thing to have, how\ninfinitely less desirable it was to live perked up in golden sorrow\nthan to feed flocks upon the Grampian Hills, where Freedom from the\nmountain height cried, \"I go on forever, a prince can make a belted\nknight, and let who will be clever. . . .\"\n\n\n\"--and besides, you'll catch your death of cold,\" lamented Rudolph\nMusgrave, who was now shaking Mr. Charteris' shoulder.\n\n\"Eh, what?  Oh, yes, I daresay I was napping,\" the other mumbled.  He\nstood and stretched himself luxuriously.  \"Well, anyhow, don't be such\nan unmitigated grandmother.  You see, I have a bit of rather important\nbusiness to attend to.  Which way is Miss Romeyne?\"\n\n\"Pauline Romeyne? why, but she married old General Ashmeade, you know.\nShe was the gray-haired woman in purple who carried out her squalling\nbrat when Taylor was introducing you, if you remember.  She told me,\nwhile the General was getting the horses around, how sorry she was to\nmiss your address, but they live three miles out, and Mrs. Ashmeade is\nsimply a slave to the children. . . .  Why, what in the world have you\nbeen dreaming about?\"\n\n\"Eh, what?  Oh, yes, I daresay I was only napping,\" Mr. Charteris\nobserved.  He was aware that within they were still playing a riotous\ntwo-step.\n\n\n\n\n_BALLAD OF PLAGIARY_\n\n  \"_Fr\u00e8res et matres, vous qui cultivez_\"--PAUL VERVILLE.\n\n\n  Hey, my masters, lords and brothers, ye that till the fields of rhyme,\n  Are ye deaf ye will not hearken to the clamor of your time?\n\n  Still ye blot and change and polish--vary, heighten and transpose--\n  Old sonorous metres marching grandly to their tranquil close.\n\n  Ye have toiled and ye have fretted; ye attain perfected speech:\n  Ye have nothing new to utter and but platitudes to preach.\n\n  And your rhymes are all of loving, as within the old days when\n  Love was lord of the ascendant in the horoscopes of men.\n\n  Still ye make of love the utmost end and scope of all your art;\n  And, more blind than he you write of, note not what a modest part\n\n  Loving now may claim in living, when we have scant time to spare,\n  Who are plundering the sea-depths, taking tribute of the air,--\n\n  Whilst the sun makes pictures for us; since to-day, for good or ill,\n  Earth and sky and sea are harnessed, and the lightnings work our will.\n\n  Hey, my masters, all these love-songs by dust-hidden mouths were sung\n  That ye mimic and re-echo with an artful-artless tongue,--\n\n  Sung by poets close to nature, free to touch her garments' hem\n  Whom to-day ye know not truly; for ye only copy them.\n\n  Them ye copy--copy always, with your backs turned to the sun,\n  Caring not what man is doing, noting that which man has done.\n\n  _We are talking over telephones, as Shakespeare could not talk;_\n  _We are riding out in motor-cars where Homer had to walk;_\n\n  _And pictures Dante labored on of mediaeval Hell_\n  _The nearest cinematograph paints quicker, and as well._\n\n  But ye copy, copy always;--and ye marvel when ye find\n  This new beauty, that new meaning,--while a model stands behind,\n\n  Waiting, young and fair as ever, till some singer turn and trace\n  Something of the deathless wonder of life lived in any place.\n\n  Hey, my masters, turn from piddling to the turmoil and the strife!\n  Cease from sonneting, my brothers; let us fashion songs from life.\n\n  _Thus I wrote ere Percie passed me. . . .  Then did I epitomize_\n  _All life's beauty in one poem, and make haste to eulogize_\n  _Quite the fairest thing life boasts of, for I wrote of Percie's eyes._\n\n\n\n\nEXPLICIT DECAS POETARUM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Certain Hour, by James Branch Cabell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CERTAIN HOUR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 288-8.txt or 288-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/288/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
