The author of\nthis novel has been pleased to describe the author of this\nintroduction as \"the only known purchaser of the book\" and, further,\nas \"the other person to own a CORDS OF VANITY\". I could readily enough\nacquit myself, with good sound legal proofs, of any such singularity\nas stands charged in this soft impeachment--and that without appeal to\n_The Cleveland Plain Dealer_ of eleven years ago (\"slushy and\ndisgusting\"), or to _The New York Post_ (\"sterile and malodorous ...\nworse than immoral--dull\"), or to _Ainslee's Magazine_ (\"inconsequent\nand rambling ... rather nauseating at times\"). These devotees of the\nadjective that hunts in pairs are hardly to be discussed, I suppose,\nin connection with any rewards except such as accrue to the possessors\nof a certain obtuseness, who always and infallibly reap at least the\nreward of not being hurt by what they do not know--or, for that\nmatter, by what they do know. He who writes such a book as THE CORDS\nOF VANITY is committing himself to the supremely irrational faith that\nthis dullness is somehow not the ultimate arbiter; and for him the\npronouncements of this dullness simply do not figure among either his\nrewards or his penalties. So, it is not exactly to these tributes of\nthe press that one reverts in noting that THE CORDS OF VANITY, on its\npublication eleven years ago, promptly became a book which there\nwere--almost--none to praise and very few to love. After all, its\nauthor's computation of that former audience of his--his actual\nindividual voluntary readers of a decade ago--appears to be but\nslightly and pardonably exaggerated on the more modest side of the\nfact. If there were a Cabell Club of membership determined solely by\nthe number of those who, already possessing THE CORDS OF VANITY in its\nfirst edition, recognize it as the work of a serious artist of high\nachievement and higher capacity, I suspect that the smallness of that\nclub would be in inordinate disproportion to everything but its\nselectness and its members' pride in \"belonging\".\n\nBe that as it may, the economist-author, on the eve of his book's\nemergence from the limbo of \"out of print\", prefers that it come into\nits redemption carrying a foreword by someone who knew it without\ndislike in its former incarnation. No contingent liability, it seems,\ncan dissuade Mr. Cabell from this preference. An author who once\nelected to precede a group of his best tales with an introduction\neloquently setting forth reasons why the collection ought not to be\npublished at all, is hardly to be deterred now by the mere\ninexpediency of hitching his star to a farm-wagon. His own graciously\nunreasonable insistence must be the excuse, such as it is, for the\npresent introduction, such as it is. If there may be said to exist a\nsort of charter membership in Mr. Cabell's audience, this document is\nto be construed as representing its very enthusiastic welcome to the\nlater and vastly larger elective membership.\n\nAnd if, weighed as such a welcome, it proves hopelessly inadequate, at\nleast it provides a number of possible compensations by the way. For\ninstance, that _New York World_ critic who damned the book but praised\nits frontispiece of 1909, has now a uniquely pat opportunity to\nbalance his ledger by praising the book and damning this foreword,\nwhich, more or less, replaces the frontispiece. Similarly, the more\nrenowned critic and anthologist who so well knows the \"originals\" of\nthe verses in _From the Hidden Way_, can now render poetically perfect\njustice to all who will care by perceiving that both the earlier\nedition of this book and the author of this foreword are but figments\nof Mr. Cabell's slightly puckish invention.\n\nBut these pages must not be, like those which follow, a comedy of\nshirking. They will have flouted a plain duty unless they speak of the\nsense and the degree in which this novel, during the process of\nreclaiming it, has been actually recreated. Perhaps the matter can be\npacked most succinctly into the statement that Mr. Cabell's hero has\nbeen subjected to such a process of growth as has made him\ncommensurate in stature with the other two modern writers of Mr.\nCabell's invention. As _The Cream of the Jest_ is essentially the book\nof Felix Kennaston and _Beyond Life_ that of John Charteris, so THE\nCORDS OF VANITY is essentially the book of Robert Etheridge Townsend.\nNow, this Townsend has accomplished a deal of growing since 1909. By\nthis I do not mean that he is taken at a later period of his own\nimagined life, or that he fails to act consonantly with the extreme\nyouth imputed to him: I mean that he is the creation of a more mature\nmind, a deeper philosophy, a more probing insight into the\nimplications of things. A given youth of twenty-five will be very\ndifferently interpreted by an observer of thirty and by the same\nobserver at forty, very much as a given era of the past will be\nunderstood differently by a single historian before and after certain\ncycles of his own social and political experience. The past never\nremains to us the same past; it grows up along with us; the physical\nfacts may remain admittedly the same, but our understanding accents\nthem differently, finds more in them at some points and less at\nothers. So Robert Etheridge Townsend remains an example of that\nspecial temperament which, being unable to endure the contact of\nunhappiness, consistently shirks every responsibility that entails or\nthreatens discomfort; and the truth about him, taking him as an\nexample of just that temperament, is still inexorably told. But his\nweakness as a man becomes much more tolerable in this second version,\nbecause it is much more intimately and poignantly correlated with his\nstrength as an artist. One is made to feel that he, like Charteris,\nmay the better consummate in his art the auctorial virtues of\ndistinction and clarity, beauty and symmetry, tenderness and truth and\nurbanity, precisely because his personal life is bereft of those\nvirtues. Less than before, the accent is on the wastrel in Townsend;\nmore than before, it is on the potential creator of beauty in him. The\nearlier readers will hardly count it as a fault that Mr. Cabell has\ncontrived to make his novel, without detriment to any truth\nwhatsoever, a far less unpleasant book. Sardonic it still is, by a\nnecessary implication, but not wantonly, and with a mellowness. The\nirony, which at its harshest was capable of rasping the nerves, has\nbecome capable of wringing the heart.\n\nOther reasons there are, too, for holding that THE CORDS OF VANITY is\ncertain to make its second appeal to a many times multiplied audience.\nSince divers momentous transactions of the years just gone, the whole\nworld stands in a moral position extraordinarily well adapted to the\ncomprehension of just such a comedy of shirking; and especially the\nworld of thought has received a powerful impulsion toward the area\nlong occupied by Mr. Cabell's romantic pessimism. There is perhaps\nsomewhat more demand for satire, or at least a growing toleration of\nit. Moreover, by sheer patience and reiteration Mr. Cabell has\nprocured no little currency for some of his most characteristic ideas.\nChivalry and gallantry, as he analyzes them, are concepts which play\ntheir part in the inevitable present re-editing of social and literary\nhistory. _The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck_, _The Cream of the Jest_,\nand _The Certain Hour_ have somewhat to say to the discriminating,\neven on other than purely aesthetic grounds; _Beyond Life_ is on the\nthreshold of its day as the _Sartor Resartus_ of one side, the\naesthetic side, of modernism;\n\n\"_Of_ Jurgen _eke they maken mencion\";_\n\nand THE CORDS OF VANITY is but the first of the earlier books to be\nreissued in the format of the uniform and accessible Intended Edition.\n\nWhile THE CORDS OF VANITY was out of print, a fresh copy is known to\nhave been acquired for twenty-five cents. Copies of a more recent work\nby the same hand--a tale which has been rendered equally unavailable\nto the public, though by slightly different considerations--have\nfetched as much as one hundred times that sum. This arithmetic may be,\nin part, the gauge of an unsought and distasteful notoriety; but that\nvery notoriety, by the most natural of transitions, will lead the\ncurious on from what cannot be obtained to what can, and some who have\nbegun by seeking one particular work of a great artist will end by\ndiscovering the artist. In short, it is rational to expect that the\nfortunes hereafter of this rewritten novel will very excellently\nillustrate the uses of adversity.\n\nNot, I repeat, that any great part of the reward for such writing can\ncome from without. According to Robert Etheridge Townsend, \"a man\nwrites admirable prose not at all for the sake of having it read, but\nfor the more sensible reason that he enjoys playing solitaire\"--a not\nun-Cabellian saying. And, even of the reward from without, it may be\nquestioned whether the really indispensable part ever comes from the\nmultitude. A lady with whose more candid opinions the writer of this\nis more frequently favored nowadays than of old has said: \"Every time\nI hear of somebody who has wanted one of these books without being\nable to get it, or who, having got it, has conceded it nothing better\nthan the disdain of an ignoramus, I feel as if I must forthwith get\nout the copy and read it through again and again, until I have read it\nonce for every person who has rejected it or been denied it.\" One may\nfeel reasonably sure that it is this kind of solicitude, rather than\nany possible sanction from the crowd, which would be thought of by the\nauthor of this book as \"the exact high prize through desire of which\nwe write\".\n\nWILSON FOLLETT.\n\nCHESHIRE, CONNECTICUT\n\n_May, 1920_\n\n\n\n\n\n        CONTENTS:\n\n        THE PROLOGUE\n\n     I  HE SITS OUT A DANCE\n\n    II  HE LOVES EXTENSIVELY\n\n   III  HE EARNS A STICK-PIN\n\n    IV  HE TALKS WITH CHARTERIS\n\n     V  HE REVISITS FAIRHAVEN AND THE PLAY\n\n    VI  HE CHATS OVER A HEDGE\n\n   VII  HE GOES MAD IN A GARDEN\n\n  VIII  HE DUELS WITH A STUPID WOMAN\n\n    IX  HE PUTS HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK\n\n     X  HE SAMPLES NEW EMOTIONS\n\n    XI  HE POSTURES AMONG CHIMNEY-POTS\n\n   XII  HE FACES HIMSELF AND REMEMBERS\n\n  XIII  HE BAITS UPON THE JOURNEY\n\n   XIV  HE PARTICIPATES IN A BRAVE JEST\n\n    XV  HE DECIDES TO AMUSE HIMSELF\n\n   XVI  HE SEEKS FOR COPY\n\n  XVII  HE PROVIDES COPY\n\n XVIII  HE SPENDS AN AFTERNOON IN ARDEN\n\n   XIX  HE PLAYS THE IMPROVIDENT FOOL\n\n    XX  HE DINES OUT, IMPEDED BY SUPERSTITIONS\n\n   XXI  HE IS URGED TO DESERT HIS GALLEY\n\n  XXII  HE CLEANS THE SLATE\n\n XXIII  HE REVILES DESTINY AND CLIMBS A WALL\n\n  XXIV  HE RECONCILES SENTIMENT AND REASON\n\n   XXV  HE ADVANCES IN THE ATTACK ON SELWOODE\n\n  XXVI  HE ASSISTS IN THE DIVERSION OF BIRDS\n\n XXVII  HE CALLS, COUNSELS, AND CONSIDERS\n\nXXVIII  HE PARTICIPATES IN SUNDRY CONFIDENCES\n\n  XXIX  HE ALLOWS THE MERITS OF IMPERFECTION\n\n   XXX  HE GILDS THE WEATHER-VANE\n\n        THE EPILOGUE: WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SECOND THOUGHTS--\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE\n\n_\"In the house and garden of his dream he saw a child moving, and\ncould divide the main streams at least of the winds that had played on\nhim, and study so the first stage in that mental journey.\"_\n\n\n\n_The Prologue: Which Deals with the Essentials_\n\n\n_1--Writing_\n\nIt appeared to me that my circumstances clamored for betterment,\nbecause never in my life have I been able to endure the contact of\nunhappiness. And my mother was always crying now, over (though I did\nnot know it) the luckiest chance which had ever befallen her; and that\nmade me cry too, without understanding exactly why.\n\nSo the child, that then was I, procured a pencil and a bit of\nwrapping-paper, and began to write laboriously:\n\n\"DEAR LORD\n\n\"You know that Papa died and please comfort Mama\nand give Father a crown of Glory Ammen\n\n\"Your lamb and very sincerely yours\n\n\"ROBERT ETHERIDGE TOWNSEND.\"\n\nThis appeared to the point as I re-read it, and of course God would\nunderstand that children were not expected to write quite as straight\nacross the paper as grown people. The one problem was how to deliver\nthis, my first letter, most expeditiously, because when your mother\ncried you always cried too, and couldn't stop, not even when you\nwanted to, not even when she promised you five cents, and it all made\nyou horribly uncomfortable.\n\nI knew that the big Bible on the parlor table was God's book. Probably\nGod read it very often, since anybody would be proud of having written\na book as big as that and would want to look at it every day. So I\ntiptoed into the darkened parlor. I use the word advisedly, for there\nwas not at this period any drawing-room in Lichfield, and besides, a\ndrawing-room is an entirely different matter.\n\nEverywhere the room was cool, and, since the shades were down, the\noutlines of the room's contents were uncomfortably dubious; for just\nwhere the table stood had been, five days ago, a big and oddly-shaped\nblack box with beautiful silver handles; and Uncle George had lifted\nme so that I could see through the pane of glass, which was a part of\nthis funny box, while an infinity of decorous people rustled and\nwhispered....\n\nI remember knowing they were \"company\" and thinking they coughed and\nsniffed because they were sorry that my father was dead. In the light\nof knowledge latterly acquired, I attribute these actions to the then\nprevalent weather, for even now I recall how stiflingly the room smelt\nof flowers--particularly of magnolia blossoms--and of rubber and of\nwet umbrellas. For my own part, I was not at all sorry, though of\ncourse I pretended to be, since I had always known that as a rule my\nfather whipped me because he had just quarreled with my mother, and\nthat he then enjoyed whipping me.\n\nI desired, in fine, that he should stay dead and possess his crown of\nglory in Heaven, which was reassuringly remote, and that my mother\nshould stop crying. So I slipped my note into the Apocrypha....\n\nI felt that somewhere in the room was God and that God was watching\nme, but I was not afraid. Yet I entertained, in common with most\nchildren, a nebulous distrust of this mysterious Person, a distrust of\nwhich I was particularly conscious on winter nights when the gas had\nbeen turned down to a blue fleck, and the shadow of the mantelpiece\nflickered and plunged on the ceiling, and the clock ticked louder and\nlouder, in prediction (I suspected) of some terrible event very close\nat hand.\n\nThen you remembered such unpleasant matters as Elisha and his bears,\nand those poor Egyptian children who had never even spoken to Moses,\nand that uncomfortably abstemious lady, in the fat blue-covered\n_Arabian Nights_, who ate nothing but rice, grain by grain--in the\ndaytime.... And you called Mammy, and said you were very thirsty and\nwanted a glass of water, please.\n\nTo-day, though, while acutely conscious of that awful inspection, and\npainstakingly careful not to look behind me, I was not, after all,\nprecisely afraid. If God were a bit like other people I knew He would\nsay, \"What an odd child!\" and I liked to have people say that. Still,\nthere was sunlight in the hall, and lots of sunlight, not just long\nand dusty shreds of sunlight, and I felt more comfortable when I was\nback in the hall.\n\n\n2--_Reading_\n\nI lay flat upon my stomach, having found that posture most conformable\nto the practice of reading, and I considered the cover of this slim,\ngreen book; the name of John Charteris, stamped thereon in fat-bellied\nletters of gold, meant less to me than it was destined to signify\nthereafter.\n\nA deal of puzzling matter I found in this book, but in my memory,\nalways, one fantastic passage clung as a burr to sheep's wool. That\nfable, too, meant less to me than it was destined to signify\nthereafter, when the author of it was used to declare that he had,\nunwittingly, written it about me. Then I read again this\n\n_Fable of the Foolish Prince_\n\n\"As to all earlier happenings I choose in this place to be silent.\nAnterior adventures he had known of the right princely sort. But\nconcerning his traffic with Schamir, the chief talisman, and how\nthrough its aid he won to the Sun's Sister for a little while; and\nconcerning his dealings with the handsome Troll-wife (in which affair\nthe cat he bribed with butter and the elm-tree he had decked with\nribbons helped him); and with that beautiful and dire Thuringian woman\nwhose soul was a red mouse: we have in this place naught to do.\nBesides, the Foolish Prince had put aside such commerce when the Fairy\ncame to guide him; so he, at least, could not in equity have grudged\nthe same privilege to his historian.\n\n\"Thus, the Fairy leading, the Foolish Prince went skipping along his\nfather's highway. But the road was bordered by so many wonders--as\nhere a bright pebble and there an anemone, say, and, just beyond, a\nbrook which babbled an entreaty to be tasted,--that many folk had\npresently overtaken and had passed the loitering Foolish Prince. First\ncame a grandee, supine in his gilded coach, with half-shut eyes,\nuneagerly meditant upon yesterday's statecraft or to-morrow's\ngallantry; and now three yokels, with ruddy cheeks and much dust upon\ntheir shoulders; now a haggard man in black, who constantly glanced\nbackward; and now a corporal with an empty sleeve, who whistled as he\nwent.\n\n\"A butterfly guided every man of them along the highway. 'For the Lord\nof the Fields is a whimsical person,' said the Fairy,' and such is his\nvery old enactment concerning the passage even of his cowpath; but\nprinces each in his day and in his way may trample this domain as\nprompt their will and skill.'\n\n\"'That now is excellent hearing,' said the Foolish Prince; and he\nstrutted.\n\n\"'Look you,' said the Fairy, 'a man does not often stumble and break\nhis shins in the highway, but rather in the byway.'....\n\n\"Thus, the Fairy leading, the Foolish Prince went skipping on his\nallotted journey, though he paused once in a while to shake his bauble\nat the staring sun.\n\n\"'The stars,' he considered, 'are more sympathetic....\n\n\"And thus, the Fairy leading, they came at last to a tall hedge\nwherein were a hundred wickets, all being closed; and those who had\npassed the Foolish Prince disputed before the hedge and measured the\nhundred wickets with thirty-nine articles and with a variety of\ninstruments, and each man entered at his chosen wicket, and a\nbutterfly went before him; but no man returned into the open country.\n\n\"'Now beyond each wicket,' said the Fairy, 'lies a great crucible, and\nby ninety and nine of these crucibles is a man consumed, or else\ntransmuted into this animal or that animal. For such is the law in\nthese parts and in human hearts.'\n\n\"The Prince demanded how if one found by chance the hundredth wicket?\nBut she shook her head and said that none of the Tylwydd Teg was\npermitted to enter the Disenchanted Garden. Rumor had it that within\nthe Garden, beyond the crucibles, was a Tree, but whether the fruit of\nthis Tree were sweet or bitter no person in the Fields could tell, nor\ndid the Fairy pretend to know what happened in the Garden.\n\n\"'Then why, in heaven's name, need a man test any of these wickets?'\ncried the Foolish Prince; 'with so much to lose and, it may be,\nnothing to gain? For one, I shall enter none of them.'\n\n\"But once more she shook her glittering head. 'In your House and in\nyour Sign it was decreed. Time will be, my Prince; to-day the kid\ngambols and the ox chews his cud. Presently the butcher cries, _Time\nis!_ Comes the hour and the power, and the cook bestirs herself and\nsays, _Time was!_ The master has his dinner, either way, all say, and\nevery day.'\n\n\"And the Fairy vanished as she talked with him, her radiances thinning\ninto the neutral colors of smoke, and thence dwindling a little by a\nlittle into the vaulting spiral of a windless and a burnt-out fire,\nuntil nothing remained of her save her voice; and that was like the\nmoving of dead leaves before they fall.\n\n\"'Truly,' said the Foolish Prince, 'I am compelled to consider this a\nvexatious business. For, look you, the butterfly I just now admire\nflits over this wicket, and then her twin flutters over that wicket,\nand between them there is absolutely no disparity in attraction. Hoo!\nhere is a more sensible insect.'\n\n\"And he leaped and cracked his heels together and ran after a golden\nbutterfly that drifted to the rearward Fields. There was such a host\nof butterflies about that presently he had lost track of his first\nchoice, and was in boisterous pursuit of a second, and then of a\nthird, and then of yet others; but none of them did he ever capture,\nthe while that one by one he followed divers butterflies of varying\ncolors, and never a golden butterfly did he find any more.\n\n\"When it was evening, the sky drew up the twilight from the east as a\nblotter draws up ink, and stars were kindling everywhere like tiny\nsignal-fires, and a light wind came out of the murky east and rustled\nvery plaintively in places where the more ambiguous shadows were; and\nthe Foolish Prince shivered, for the air was growing chill, and the\ntips of his fingers were aware of it.\n\n\"'A crucible,' he reflected, 'possesses the minor virtue of continuous\nwarmth.'\n\n\"And before the hedge he found a Rational Person, led hither by a\nClothes' Moth, working out the problem of the hundred wickets in\nconsonance with the most approved methods. 'I have very nearly solved\nit,' the Rational Person said, in genteel triumph, 'but this evening\ngrows too dark for any further ciphering, and again I must wait until\nto-morrow. I regret, sir, that you have elected to waste the day, in\npursuit of various meretricious Lepidoptera.'\n\n\"'A happy day, my brother, is never wasted.\"\n\n\"'That appears to me to be nonsense,' said the Rational Person; and he\nput up his portfolio, preparatory to spending another night under his\numbrella in the Fields.\n\n\"'Indeed, my brother?' laughed the Foolish Prince. 'Then, farewell,\nfor I am assured that yonder, as here, our father makes the laws, and\nthat to dispute his appreciation of the enticing qualities of\nbutterflies were an impertinence.'\n\n\"Thereafter, pushing open the wicket nearest to his hand, the Foolish\nPrince tucked his bauble under his left arm and skipped into the\nDisenchanted Garden; and as he went he sang, not noting that, from\nsomewhere in the thickening shadows, had arisen a golden butterfly\nwhich went before him through the wicket.\n\n\"Sang the Foolish Prince:\n\n  \"'Farewell to Fields and Butterflies\n  And levities of Yester-year!\n  For we espy, and hold more dear,\n  The Wicket of our Destinies.\n\n  \"'Whereby we enter, once for all,\n  A Garden which such fruit doth yield\n  As, tasted once, no more Afield\n  We fare where Youth holds carnival.\n\n  \"'Farewell, fair Fields, none found amiss\n  When laughter was a frequent noise\n  And golden-hearted girls and boys\n  Appraised the mouth they meant to kiss.\n\n  \"'Farewell, farewell! but for a space\n  We, being young, Afield might stray,\n  That in our Garden nod and say,\n  _Afield is no unpleasant place.'\"_\n\n\n3--_Arithmetic_\n\nIn such disconnected fashion, as hereafter, I record the moments of my\nlife which I most vividly remember. For it is possible only in the\nlast paragraphs of a book, and for a book's people only, to look back\nupon an ordered and proportionate progression to what one has become;\nin life the thing arrives with scantier dignity; and one appears, in\nretrospection, less to have marched toward any goal than always to\nhave jumped and scrambled from one stepping-stone to another because,\nhowever momentarily, \"just this or that poor impulse seemed the sole\nwork of a lifetime.\"\n\nWell! at least I have known these moments and the rapture of their\ndominance; and I am not lightly to be stripped of recollection of\nthem, nor of the attendant thrill either, by any cheerless hour\nwherein, as sometimes happens, my personal achievements confront me\nlike a pile of flimsy jack-straws.\n\nWhat does it all amount to?--I do not know. There may be some sort of\nsupernal bookkeeping, somewhere, but very certainly it is not\nconformable to any human mathematics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n _THE CORDS OF VANITY\n\n\"His has been the summer air, and the sunshine, and the flowers; and\ngentle ears have listened to him, and gentle eyes have been upon him.\nLet others eat his honey that please, so that he has had his morsel\nand his song.\"_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n_He Sits Out a Dance_\n\n\nWhen I first knew Stella she was within a month of being fifteen,\nwhich is for womankind an unattractive age. There were a startling\nnumber of corners to her then, and she had but vague notions as to the\nmanagement of her hands and feet. In consequence they were perpetually\nturning up in unexpected places and surprising her by their size and\nnumber. Yes, she was very hopelessly fifteen; and she was used to\nlaugh, unnecessarily, in a nervous fashion, approximating to a whinny,\nand when engaged in conversation she patted down her skirts six times\nto the minute.\n\nIt seems oddly unbelievable when I reflect that Rosalind--\"daughter to\nthe banished Duke\"--and Stella and Helen of Troy, and all the other\nfamous fair ones of history, were each like that at one period or\nanother.\n\nAs for myself, I was nine days younger than Stella, and so I was at\nthis time very old--much older than it is ever permitted anyone to be\nafterward. I cherished the most optimistic ideas as to my impendent\nmoustache, and was wont in privacy to encourage it with the\nmanicure-scissors. I still entertained the belief that girls were\nupon the whole superfluous nuisances, but was beginning to perceive\nthe expediency of concealing this opinion, even in private converse\nwith my dearest chum, where, in our joyous interchange of various\nheresies, we touched upon this especial sub-division of fauna very\nlightly, and, I now suspect, with some self-consciousness.\n\n\n 2\n\nAll this was at a summer resort, which was called the Green\nChalybeate. Stella and I and others of our age attended the hotel hops\nin the evening with religious punctuality, for well-meaning elders\ninsisted these dances amused us, and it was easier to go than to argue\nthe point. At least, that was the feeling of the boys.\n\nStella has since sworn the girls liked it. I suspect in this statement\na certain parsimony as to the truth. They giggled too much and were\nnever entirely free from that haunting anxiety concerning their\nskirts.\n\nWe danced together, Stella and I, to the strains of the last Sousa\ntwo-step (it was the _Washington Post_), and we conversed, meanwhile,\nwith careful disregard of the amenities of life, since each feared\nlest the other might suspect in some common courtesy an attempt\nat--there is really no other word--spooning. And spooning was absurd.\n\nWell, as I once read in the pages of a rare and little known author,\none lives and learns.\n\nI asked Stella to sit out a dance. I did this because I had heard Mr.\nLethbury--a handsome man with waxed mustachios and an absolutely\npiratical amount of whiskers,--make the same request of Miss Van\nOrden, my just relinquished partner, and it was evident that such\nwhiskers could do no wrong.\n\nStella was not uninfluenced, it may be, by Miss Van Orden's example,\nfor even in girlhood the latter was a person of extraordinary beauty,\nwhereas, as has been said, Stella's corners were then multitudinous;\nand it is probable that those two queer little knobs at the base of\nStella's throat would be apt to render their owner uncomfortable and a\nbit abject before--let us say--more ample charms. In any event, Stella\ngiggled and said she thought it would be just fine, and I presently\nconducted her to the third piazza of the hotel.\n\nThere we found a world that was new.\n\n\n 3\n\nIt was a world of sweet odors and strange lights, flooded with a\nkindly silence which was, somehow, composed of many lispings and\ntrepidations and thin echoes. The night was warm, the sky all\ntransparency. If the comparison was not manifestly absurd, I would\nliken that remembered sky's pale color to the look of blue plush\nrubbed the wrong way. And in its radiance the stars bathed, large and\nbright and intimate, yet blurred somewhat, like shop-lights seen\nthrough frosted panes; and the moon floated on it, crisp and clear as\na new-minted coin. This was the full midsummer moon, grave and\nglorious, that compelled the eye; and its shield was obscurely marked,\nas though a Titan had breathed on its chill surface. Its light\nsuffused the heavens and lay upon the earth beneath us in broad\nsplashes; and the foliage about us was dappled with its splendor, save\nin the open east, where the undulant, low hills wore radiancy as a\nmantle.\n\nFor the trees, mostly maples of slight stature, clustered thickly\nabout the hotel, and their branches mingled in a restless pattern of\nblacks and silvers and dim greens that mimicked the laughter of the\nsea under an April wind. Looking down from the piazza, over the\nexpanse of tree-tops, all this was strangely like the sea; and it gave\none, somehow, much the same sense of remote, unbounded spaces and of a\nbeauty that was a little sinister. At times whippoorwills called to\none another, eerie and shrill; and the distant dance-music was a\nvibration in the air, which was heavy with the scent of bruised\ngrowing things and was filled with the cool, healing magic of the\nmoonlight.\n\nTaking it all in all, we had blundered upon a very beautiful place.\nAnd there we sat for a while and talked in an aimless fashion. We did\nnot know quite how one ought to \"sit out\" a dance, you conceive....\n\n\n 4\n\nThen, moved by some queer impulse, I stared over the railing for a\nlittle at this great, wonderful, ambiguous world, and said solemnly:\n\n\"It is good.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Stella agreed, in a curious, quiet and tiny voice, \"it--it's\nvery large, isn't it?\" She looked out for a moment over the tree-tops.\n\"It makes me feel like a little old nothing,\" she said, at last. \"The\nstars are so big, and--so uninterested.\" Stella paused for an\ninterval, and then spoke again, with an uncertain laugh. \"I think I am\nrather afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\" I echoed.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, vaguely; \"of--of everything.\"\n\nI understood. Even then I knew something of the occasional\ninsufficiency of words.\n\n\"It is a big world,\" I assented, \"and lots of people are having a\nright hard time in it right now. I reckon there is somebody dying this\nvery minute not far off.\"\n\n\"It's all--waiting for us!\" Stella had forgotten my existence. \"It's\nbringing us so many things--and we don't know what any of them are.\nBut we've got to take them, whether we want to or not. It isn't fair.\nWe've got to--well, got to grow up, and--marry, and--die, whether we\nwant to or not. We've no choice. And it may not matter, after all.\nEverything will keep right on like it did before; and the stars won't\ncare; and what we've done and had done to us won't really matter!\"\n\n\"Well, but, Stella, you can have a right good time first, anyway, if\nyou keep away from ugly things and fussy people. And I reckon you\nreally go to Heaven afterwards if you haven't been really bad,--don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Rob,--are you ever afraid of dying?\" Stella asked, \"very much\nafraid--Oh, you know what I mean.\"\n\nI did. I was about ten once more. It was dark, and I was passing a\ndrug-store, with huge red and green and purple bottles glistening in\nthe gas-lit windows; and it had just occurred to me that I, too, must\ndie, and be locked up in a box, and let down with trunk-straps into a\nhole, like Father was.... So I said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"And yet we've got to! Oh, I don't see how people can go on living\nlike everything was all right when that's always getting nearer,--when\nthey know they've got to die before very long. Because they dance and\ngo on picnics and buy hats as if they were going to live forever.\nI--oh, I can't understand.\"\n\n\"They get used to the idea, I reckon. We're sort of like the rats in\nthe trap at home, in our stable,\" I suggested, poetically. \"We can bite\nthe wires and go crazy, like lots of them do, if we want to, or we can\neat the cheese and kind of try not to think about it. Either way, there's\nno getting out till they come to kill us in the morning.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Stella; \"I suppose we must make the best of it.\"\n\n\"It's the only sensible thing to do, far as I can see.\"\n\n\"But it is all so big--and so careless about us!\" she said, after a\nlittle. \"And we don't know--we can't know!--what is going to happen to\nyou and me. And we can't stop its happening!\"\n\n\"We'll just have to make the best of that, too,\" I protested,\ndolefully.\n\nStella sighed again, \"I hope so,\" she assented; \"still, I'm scared of\nit.\"\n\n\"I think I am, too--sort of,\" I conceded, after reflection. \"Anyhow, I\nam going to have as good a time as I can.\"\n\nThere was now an even longer pause. Pitiable, ridiculous infants were\npondering, somewhat vaguely but very solemnly, over certain mysteries\nof existence, which most of us have learned to accept with stolidity.\nWe were young, and to us the miraculous insecurity and inconsequence\nof human life was still a little impressive, and we had not yet come\nto regard the universe as a more or less comfortable place,\nwell-meaningly constructed anyhow--by Somebody--for us to reside in.\n\nTherefore we moved a trifle closer together, Stella and I, and were\ncommonly miserable over the _Weltschmerz_. After a little a distant\nwhippoorwill woke me from a chaos of reverie, and I turned to Stella,\nwith a vague sense that we two were the only people left in the whole\nworld, and that I was very, very fond of her.\n\nStella's head was leaned backward. Her lips were parted, and the\nmoonlight glinted in her eyes. Her eyes were blue.\n\n\"Don't!\" said Stella, faintly.\n\nI did....\n\nIt was a matter out of my volition, out of my planning. And, oh, the\nwonder, and sweetness, and sacredness of it! I thought, even in the\ninstant; and, oh, the pity that, after all, it is slightly\ndisappointing....\n\nStella was not angry, as I had half expected. \"That was dear of you,\"\nshe said, impulsively, \"but don't try to do it again.\" There was the\nwisdom of centuries in this mandate of Stella's as she rose from the\nbench. The spell was broken, utterly. \"I think,\" said Stella, in the\nvoice of a girl of fifteen, \"I think we'd better go and dance some\nmore.\"\n\n\n 5\n\nIn the crude morning I approached Stella, with a fatuous smile. She\napparently both perceived and resented my bearing, although she never\nonce looked at me. There was something of great interest to her in the\ndistance, apparently down by the springhouse; she was flushed and\nindignant; and her eyes wouldn't, couldn't, and didn't turn for an\ninstant in my direction.\n\nI fidgeted.\n\n\"If,\" said she, impersonally, \"if you believe it was because of _you_,\nyou are very much mistaken. It would have been the same with anybody.\nYou don't understand, and I don't either. Anyhow, I think you are a\nmess, and I hate you. Go away from me!\"\n\nAnd she stamped her foot in a fine rage.\n\nFor the moment I entertained an un-Christian desire that Stella had\nbeen born a boy. In that case, I felt, I would, just then, have really\nenjoyed sitting upon the back of her head, and grinding her nose into\nthe lawn, and otherwise persuading her to cry \"'Nough.\" These virile\npleasures being denied me, I sought for comfort in discourteous\nspeech.\n\n\"Umph-huh!\" said I, \"and you think you're mighty smart, don't you?\nWell, I don't want you pawing around me any more, either. I won't have\nit, do you understand! That was what I was going to tell you anyhow,\nyou kissing-bug, even if you hadn't acted so smart. And you can just\nstick that right in your pipe and smoke it, you old Miss Smart Alec.\"\n\nThereupon I--wisely--departed without delay. A rock struck me rather\nforcibly between the shoulder blades, but I did not deign to notice\nthis phenomenon.\n\n\"You can't fight girls with fists,\" I reflected. \"You've just got to\ntalk to them in the right way.\"\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n_He Loves Extensively_\n\n\nI saw no more of Stella for a lengthy while, since within two days of\nthe events recorded it pleased my mother to seek out another summer\nresort.\n\n\"For in September,\" she said, \"I really must have perfect quiet and\nunimpeachable butter, and falling leaves, and only a very few\ncongenial people to be melancholy with,--and that sort of thing, you\nknow. I find it freshens one up so against the winter.\"\n\nIt was a signal feature of my mother's conversation that you never\nunderstood, precisely, what she was talking about.\n\nThus in her train the silly, pretty woman drew otherwhither her\nhobbledehoy son, as indeed Claire Bulmer Townsend had aforetime drawn\nan armament of more mature and stolid members of my sex. I was always\nproud of my handsome mother, but without any aspirations, however\ntheoretical, toward intimacy; and her periods of conscientious if\nvague affection, when she recollected its propriety, I endured with\nconsolatory foreknowledge of an impendent, more agreeable era of\nneglect.\n\nI fancy that at bottom I was without suspecting it lonely. I was an\nonly child; my father had died, as has been hinted, when I was in\nkilts.... No, I must have graduated from kilts into \"knee-pants\" when\nthe Democracy of Lichfield celebrated Grover Cleveland's first\nelection as President, for I was seven years old then, and was allowed\nto stay up ever so late after supper to watch the torchlight parade. I\nrecollect being rather pleasantly scared by the yells of all those\nmarching people and by the glistening of their faces as the irregular\nflaring torches heaved by; and I recollect how delightfully the cold\nnight air was flavored with kerosene. In any event, it was on this\ngenerally festive November night that my father again took too much to\ndrink, and, coming home toward morning, lay down and went to sleep in\nthe vestibule between our front-door and the storm-doors; and five\ndays later died of pneumonia...In that era I was accounted an odd boy;\ngiven to reading and secretive ways, and, they record, to long\nsilences throughout which my lips would move noiselessly. \"Just\ntalking to one of my friends,\" they tell me I was used to explain;\nthough it was not until my career at King's College that I may be said\nto have pretended to intimacy with anybody.\n\n\n 2\n\nFor in old Fairhaven I spent, of course, a period of ostensible study,\nas four generations of my fathers had done aforetime. But in that\nleisured, slatternly and ancient city I garnered a far larger harvest\nof (comparatively) innocuous cakes and ale than of authentic learning,\nand at my graduation carried little of moment from the place save many\nmemories of Bettie Hamlyn.... Her father taught me Latin at King's\nCollege, while Bettie taught me human intimacy--almost. Looking back,\nI have not ever been intimate with anybody....\n\nNot but that I had my friends. In particular I remember those four of\nus who always called ourselves--in flat defiance, just as Dumas did,\nof mere arithmetic--\"The Three Musketeers.\" I think that we loved one\nanother very greatly during the four years we spent together in our\nyouth. I like to believe we did, and to remember the boys who were\nonce unreasonably happy, even now. It does not seem to count, somehow,\nthat Aramis has taken to drink and every other inexpedient course, I\nhear, and that I would not recognize him today, were we two to\nencounter casually--or Athos, either, I suppose, now that he has been\nso long in the Philippines.\n\nAnd as for D'Artagnan--or Billy Woods, if you prefer the appellation\nwhich his sponsors gave him,--why we are still good friends and always\nwill be, I suppose. But we are not particularly intimate; and very\ncertainly we will never again read _Chastelard_ together and declaim\nthe more impassioned parts of it,--and in fine, I cannot help seeing,\nnowadays, that, especially since his marriage, Billy has developed\ninto a rather obvious and stupid person, and that he considers me to\nbe a bit of a bad egg. And in a phrase, when we are together, just we\ntwo, we smoke a great deal and do not talk any more than is necessary.\n\nAnd once I would have quite sincerely enjoyed any death, however\nexcruciating, which promoted the well-being of Billy Woods; and he\nviewed me not dissimilarly, I believe.... However, after all, this was\na long, long while ago, and in a period almost antediluvian.\n\nAnd during this period they of Fairhaven assumed I was in love with\nBettie Hamlyn; and for a very little while, at the beginning, had I\nassumed as much. More lately was my error flagrantly apparent when I\nfell in love with someone else, and sincerely in love, and found to my\namazement that, upon the whole, I preferred Bettie's companionship to\nthat of the woman I adored. By and by, though, I learned to accept\nthis odd, continuing phenomenon much as I had learned to accept the\nsunrise.\n\n\n 3\n\nOnce Bettie demanded of me, \"I often wonder what you really think of\nme? Honest injun, I mean.\"\n\nI meditated, and presently began, with leisure:\n\n\"Miss Hamlyn is a young woman of considerable personal attractions,\nand with one exception is unhandicapped by accomplishments. She plays\nthe piano, it is true, but she does it divinely and she neither\ncrochets nor embroiders presents for people, nor sketches, nor\nrecites, nor sings, or in fine annoys the public in any way\nwhatsoever. Her enemies deny that she is good-looking, but even her\nfriends concede her curious picturesqueness and her knowledge of it.\nHer penetration, indeed, is not to be despised; she has even grasped\nthe fact that all men are not necessarily fools in spite of the\nfashion in which they talk to women. It must be admitted, however,\nthat her emotions are prone to take precedence of her reasoning\npowers: thus she is not easily misled from getting what she desires,\nsave by those whom she loves, because in argument, while always\nillogical, she is invariably convincing--\"\n\nMiss Hamlyn sniffed. \"This is, perhaps, the inevitable effect of\ntwenty cigarettes a day,\" was her cryptic comment. \"Nevertheless, it\ndoes affect me with ennui.\"\n\n\"--For, the mere facts of the case she plainly demonstrates, with the\nabettance of her dimples, to be an affair of unimportance; the real\npoint is what she wishes done about it. Yet the proffering of any\nparticular piece of advice does not necessarily signify that she\neither expects or wishes it to be followed, since had she been present\nat the Creation she would have cheerfully pointed out to the Deity His\nvarious mistakes, and have offered her co-operation toward bettering\nmatters, and have thought a deal less of Him had He accepted it; but\nthis is merely a habit--\" \"Yes?\" said Bettie, yawning; and she added:\n\"Do you know, Robin, the saddest and most desolate thing in the world\nis to practise an _etude_ of Schumann's in nine flats, and the next is\nto realize that a man who has been in love with you has recovered for\nkeeps?\"\n\n\"--It must not be imagined, however, that Miss Hamlyn is untruthful,\nfor when driven by impertinences into a corner she conceals her real\nopinion by voicing it quite honestly as if she were joking. Thereupon\nyou credit her with the employment of irony and the possession of\nevery imaginable and super-angelical characteristic--\"\n\n\"Unless we come to a better understanding,\" Miss Hamlyn crisply began,\n\"we had better stop right here before we come to a worse--\"\n\n\"--Miss Hamlyn, in a word, is possessed of no insufferable virtues and\nof many endearing faults; and in common with the rest of humanity, she\nregards her disapproval of any proceeding as clear proof of its\nimpropriety.\" This was largely apropos of a fire-new debate concerning\nthe deleterious effects of cigarette-smoking; and when I had made an\nend, and doggedly lighted another one of them, Bettie said nothing....\nShe minded chiefly that one of us should have thought of the other\nwithout bias. She said it was not fair. And I know now that she was\nright.\n\nBut of Bettie Hamlyn, for reasons you may learn hereafter if you so\nelect, I honestly prefer to write not at all. Four years, in fine, we\nspent to every purpose together, and they were very happy years. To\nrecord them would be desecration.\n\n\n 4\n\nMeantime, during these years, I had fallen in and out of love\nassiduously. Since the Anabasis of lad's love traverses a monotonous\ncountry, where one hill is largely like another, and one meadow a\nduplicate of the next to the last daffodil, I may with profit dwell\nupon the green-sickness lightly. It suffices that in the course of\nthese four years I challenged superstition by adoring thirteen girls,\nand, worse than that, wrote verses of them.\n\nI give you their names herewith--though not their workaday names, lest\nthe wives of divers people be offended (and in many cases, surprised),\nbut the appellatives which figured in my rhymes. They were Heart's\nDesire, Florimel, Dolores, Yolande, Adelais, Sylvia, Heart o' My\nHeart, Chloris, Felise, Ettarre, Phyllis, Phyllida, and Dorothy. Here\nwas a rosary of exquisite names, I even now concede; and the owner of\neach _nom de plume_ I, for however brief a period, adored for this or\nthat peculiar excellence; and by ordinary without presuming to mention\nthe fact to any of these divinities save Heart o' My Heart, who was,\nafter all, only a Penate.\n\nOutside the elevated orbits of rhyme she was called Elizabeth Hamlyn;\nand it afterward became apparent to me that I, in reality, wrote all\nthe verses of this period solely for the pleasure of reading them\naloud to Bettie, for certainly I disclosed their existence to no one\nelse--except just one or two to Phyllida, who was \"literary.\"\n\nAnd the upshot of all this heart-burning is most succinctly given in\nmy own far from impeccable verse, as Bettie Hamlyn heard the summing-up\none evening in May. It was the year I graduated from King's\nCollege, and the exact relation of the date to the Annos Domini is\ntrivial. But the battle of Manila had just been fought, and off\nSantiago Captain Sampson and Commander Schley were still hunting for\nCervera's \"phantom fleet.\" And in Fairhaven, as I remember it,\nalthough there was a highly-colored picture of Commodore Dewey in the\nbarber-shop window, nobody was bothering in the least about the war\nexcept when Colonel Snawley and Dr. Jeal foregathered at Clarriker's\nEmporium to denounce the colossal errors of \"imperialism\"....\n\n  \"Thus, then, I end my calendar\n  Of ancient loves more light than air;--\n  And now Lad's Love, that led afar\n  In April fields that were so fair,\n  Is fled, and I no longer share\n  Sedate unutterable days\n  With Heart's Desire, nor ever praise\n  Felise, or mirror forth the lures\n  Of Stella's eyes nor Sylvia's,\n  Yet love for each loved lass endures.\n\n  \"Chloris is wedded, and Ettarre\n  Forgets; Yolande loves otherwhere,\n  And worms long since made bold to mar\n  The lips of Dorothy and fare\n  Mid Florimel's bright ruined hair;\n  And Time obscures that roseate haze\n  Which glorified hushed woodland ways\n  When Phyllis came, as Time obscures\n  That faith which once was Phyllida's,--\n  Yet love for each loved lass endures.\n\n  \"That boy is dead as Schariar,\n  Tiglath-pileser, or Clotaire,\n  Who once of love got many a scar.\n  And his loved lasses past compare?--\n  None is alive now anywhere.\n  Each is transmuted nowadays\n  Into a stranger, and displays\n  No whit of love's investitures.\n  I let these women go their ways,\n  Yet love for each loved lass endures.\n\n  \"Heart o' My Heart, thine be the praise\n  If aught of good in me betrays\n  Thy tutelage--whose love matures\n  Unmarred in these more wistful days,--\n  Yet love for each loved lass endures.\"\n\nFor this was the year that I graduated, and Chloris--I violate no\nconfidence in stating that her actual name was Aurelia Minns, and that\nshe had been, for a greater number of years than it would be courteous\nto remember, the undisputed belle of Fairhaven,--had that very\nafternoon married a promising young doctor; and I was draining the cup\nof my misery to the last delicious drop, and was of course inspired\nthereby to the perpetration of such melancholy bathos as only a\ncare-free youth of twenty is capable of evolving.\n\n\n 5\n\n\"Dear boy,\" said Bettie, when I had made an end of reading, \"and are\nyou very miserable?\"\n\nHer fingers were interlocked behind her small black head; and the\nsympathy with which she regarded me was tenderly flavored with\namusement.\n\nThis much I noticed as I glanced upward from my manuscript, and\nmustered a Spartan smile. \"If misery loves company, then am I the\nleast unhappy soul alive. For I don't want anybody but just you, and I\nbelieve I never will.\"\n\n\"Oh--? But I don't count.\" The girl continued, with composure: \"Or\nrather, I have always counted your affairs, so that I know precisely\nwhat it all amounts to.\"\n\n\"Sum total?\"\n\n\"A lot of imitation emotions.\" She added hastily: \"Oh, quite a good\nimitation, dear; you are smooth enough to see to that. Why, I remember\nonce--when you read me that first sonnet, sitting all hunched up on\nthe little stool, and pretending you didn't know I knew who you meant\nme to know it was for, and ending with a really very effective,\nbreathless sob--and caught my hand and pressed it to your forehead for\na moment--Why, that time I was thoroughly rattled and almost\nbelieved--even I--that--\" She shrugged. \"And if I had been\nyounger--!\" she said, half regretfully, for at this time Bettie was\nvery nearly twenty-two.\n\n\"Yes.\" The effective breathless sob responded to what had virtually\nbeen an encore. \"I have not forgotten.\"\n\n\"Only for a moment, though.\" Miss Hamlyn reflected, and then added,\nbrightly: \"Now, most girls would have liked it, for it sounded all\nwool. And they would have gone into it, as you wanted, and have been\nvery, very happy for a while. Then, after a time--after you had got a\nsonnet or two out of it, and had made a sufficiency of pretty\nspeeches,--you would have gone for an admiring walk about yourself,\nand would have inspected your sensations and have applauded them,\nquite enthusiastically, and would have said, in effect: 'Madam, I\nthank you for your attention. Pray regard the incident as closed.'\"\n\n\"You are doing me,\" I observed, \"an injustice. And however tiny they\nmay be, I hate 'em.\"\n\n\"But, Robin, can't you see,\" she said, with an odd earnestness, \"that\nto be fond of you is quite disgracefully easy, even though--\" Bettie\nHamlyn said, presently: \"Why, your one object in life appears to be to\nfind a girl who will allow you to moon around her and make verses\nabout her. Oh, very well! I met to-day just the sort of pretty idiot\nwho will let you do it. She is visiting Kathleen Eppes for the Finals.\nShe has a great deal of money, too, I hear.\" And Bettie mentioned a\nname.\n\n\"That's rather queer,\" said I. \"I used to know that girl. She will be\nat the K. A. dance to-morrow night, I suppose,\"--and I put up my\nmanuscript with a large air of tolerance. \"I dare say that I have been\nexaggerating matters a bit, after all. Any woman who treated me\nin the way that Miss Aurelia did is not, really, worthy of regret. And\nin any event, I got a ballade out of her and six--no, seven--other\npoems.\"\n\nFor the name which Bettie had mentioned was that of Stella Musgrave,\nand I was, somehow, curiously desirous to come again to Stella, and\nnervous about it, too, even then....\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n_He Earns a Stick-pin_\n\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Stella, wonderingly; \"I would never have known you in\nthe world! You've grown so fa--I mean, you are so well built. I've\ngrown? Nonsense!--and besides, what did you expect me to do in six\nyears?--and moreover, it is abominably rude of you to presume to speak\nof me in that abstracted and figurative manner--quite as if I were a\ndebt or a taste for drink. It is really only French heels and a\npompadour, and, of course, you can't have this dance. It's promised,\nand I hop, you know, frightfully.... Why, naturally, I haven't\nforgotten--How could I, when you were the most disagreeable boy I ever\nknew?\"\n\nI ventured a suggestion that caused Stella to turn an attractive pink,\nand laugh. \"No,\" said she, demurely, \"I shall never never sit out\nanother dance with you.\"\n\nSo she did remember!\n\nSubsequently: \"Our steps suit perfectly--Heavens! you are the fifth\nman who has said that to-night, and I am sure it would be very silly\nand very tiresome to dance through life with anybody. Men are so\nabsurd, don't you think? Oh, yes, I tell them all--every one of\nthem--that our steps suit, even when they have just ripped off a yard\nor so of flounce in an attempt to walk up the front of my dress. It\nmakes them happy, poor things, and injures nobody. You liked it, you\nknow; you grinned like a pleased cat. I like cats, don't you?\"\n\nLater: \"That is absolute nonsense, you know,\" said Stella, critically.\n\"Do you always get red in the face when you make love? I wouldn't if I\nwere you. You really have no idea how queer it makes you look.\"\n\nStill later: \"No, I don't think I am going anywhere to-morrow\nafternoon,\" said Stella.\n\n\n 2\n\nSo that during the fleet moments of these Finals, while our army was\neffecting a landing in Cuba, I saw as much of Stella as was possible;\nand veracity compels the admission that she made no marked effort to\nprevent my doing so. Indeed, she was quite cross, and scornful, about\nthe crowning glory being denied her, of going with me to the\nBaccalaureate Address the morning I received my degree. To that of\ncourse I took Bettie.\n\n\n 3\n\nI said good-bye to Bettie Hamlyn rather late one evening. It was in\nher garden. The Finals were over, and Stella had left Fairhaven that\nafternoon. I was to follow in the morning, by an early train.\n\nIt was a hot, still night in June, with never a breath of air\nstirring. In the sky was a low-hung moon, full and very red. It was an\nevil moon, and it lighted a night that was unreasonably ominous. And\nBettie and I had talked of trifles resolutely for two hours.\n\n\"Well--good-bye Bettie,\" I said at last. \"I'm glad it isn't for long.\"\nFor of course we meant never to let a month elapse without our seeing\neach other.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said, and casually shook hands.\n\nThen Bettie Hamlyn said, in a different voice: \"Robin, you come of\nsuch a bad lot, and already you are by way of being a rather frightful\nliar. And I'm letting you go. I'm turning you over to Stellas and\nmothers and things like that just because I have to. It isn't fair.\nThey will make another Townsend of my boy, and after all I've tried to\ndo. Oh, Robin, don't let anybody or anything do that to you! Do try to\ndo the unpleasant thing sometimes, my dear!--But what's the good of\npromising?\"\n\n\"And have I ever failed you, Bettie?\"\n\n\"No,--not me,\" she answered, almost as though she grudged the fact.\nThen Bettie laughed a little. \"Indeed, I'm trying to believe you never\nwill. Oh, indeed, I am. But just be honest with me, Robin, and nothing\nelse will ever matter very much. I don't care what you do, if only you\nare always honest with me. You can murder people, if you like, and\nburn down as many houses as you choose. You probably will. But you'll\nbe honest with me--won't you?--and particularly when you don't want to\nbe?\"\n\nSo I promised her that. And sometimes I believe it is the only promise\nwhich I ever tried to keep quite faithfully....\n\n\n 4\n\nAnd all the ensuing summer I followed Stella Musgrave from one\nwatering place to another, with an engaging and entire candor as to my\ndesires. I was upon the verge of my majority, when, under the terms of\nmy father's will, I would come into possession of such fragments of\nhis patrimony as he had omitted to squander. And afterward I intended\nto become excessively distinguished in this or that profession, not as\nyet irrevocably fixed upon, but for choice as a writer of immortal\nverse; and I was used to dwell at this time very feelingly, and very\nfrequently, upon the wholesome restraint which matrimony imposes upon\nthe possessor of an artistic temperament.\n\nStella promised to place my name upon her waiting list, and to take up\nthe matter in due season; and she lamented, with a tiny and\npre-meditated yawn, that as a servitor of system she was compelled to\nlist her \"little lovers and suitors in alphabetical order, Mr.\nTownsend. Besides, you would probably strangle me before the year was\nout.\"\n\n\"I would thoroughly enjoy doing it,\" I said, grimly, \"right now.\" She\nregarded me for a while. \"You would, too,\" she said at last, with an\nalien gravity; \"and that is why--Oh, Rob dear, you are out of my\ndimension. I am rather afraid of you. I am a poor bewildered triangle\nwho is being wooed by a cube!\" the girl wailed, and but half\nhumorously.\n\nAnd I began to plead. It does not matter what I said. It never\nmattered.\n\nAnd persons more sensible than I found then far more important things\nto talk about, such as General Alger's inefficiency, and General\nShafter's hammock, and \"embalmed beef,\" and the folly of taking over\nthe Philippines, and Admiral von Diedrich's behavior, and the yellow\nfever in our camps and the comparative claims of Messrs. Sampson and\nSchley to be made rear-admiral; and everybody more or less was\ndemanding \"an investigation,\" as the natural aftermath of a war.\n\n\n 5\n\nStella's mother had closed Bellemeade for the year, however, and they\nwere to spend the winter in Lichfield; and Stella, to reduplicate her\nphrase, promised to \"think it over very seriously.\"\n\nBut I suppose I had never any real chance against Peter Blagden. To\nbegin with,--though Stella herself, of course, would inherit plenty\nof money when her mother died,--Peter was the only nephew of a\nchildless uncle who was popularly reported to \"roll in wealth\"; and in\naddition, Peter was seven years older than I and notoriously\ndissipated. No other girl of twenty would have hesitated between us\nhalf so long as Stella did. She hesitated through a whole winter; and\neven now there is odd, if scanty, comfort in the fact that Stella\nhesitated....\n\nBesides Peter was eminently likeable. At times I almost liked him\nmyself, for all my fervent envy of his recognized depravity and of the\nhateful ease with which he thought of something to say in those\nuncomfortable moments when he and I and Stella were together. At most\nother times I could talk glibly enough, but before this seasoned\nscapegrace I was dumb, and felt my reputation to be hopelessly\nimmaculate ... If only Stella would believe me to be just the tiniest\nbit depraved! I blush to think of the dark hints I dropped as to\nentirely fictitious women who \"had been too kind to me. But then\"--as\nI would feelingly lament,--\"we could never let women alone, we\nTownsends, you know--\"\n\n\n 6\n\nOne woman at least I was beginning to \"let alone\", in that I was\nwriting Bettie Hamlyn letters which grew shorter and shorter.... Her\nmother had fallen ill, not long after I left college; and she and\nBettie were now a great way off, in Colorado, where the old lady was\ndying, with the most selfish sort of laziness about it, and so was\ninvolving me in endless correspondence.... At least, I wrote to Bettie\npunctually, if briefly, though I had not seen her since that night\nwhen the moon was red, and big, and very evil. I had to do it, because\nshe had insisted that I write.\n\n\"But letters don't mean anything, Bettie. And besides, I hate writing\nletters.\"\n\n\"That is just why you must write to me regularly. You never do the\nthings you don't want to do. I know it. But for me you always will,\nand that makes all the difference.\"\n\n\"Shylock!\" I retorted.\n\n\"If you like. In any event, I mean to have my pound of flesh, and\nregularly.\"\n\nSo I wrote to Bettie Hamlyn on the seventh of every month--because\nthat was her birthday,--and again on the twenty-third, because that\nwas mine. The rest of my time I gave whole-heartedly to Stella....\n\n\n 7\n\nThey named her Stella, I fancy, because her eyes were so like stars.\nIt is manifestly an irrelevant detail that there do not happen to be\nany azure stars. Indeed, I am inclined to think that Nature belatedly\nobserved this omission, and created Stella's eyes to make up for it;\nat any rate, if you can imagine Aldebaran or Benetnasch polished up a\nbit and set in a speedwell-cup, you will have a very fair idea of one\nof them. You cannot, however, picture to yourself the effect of the\npair of them, because the human mind is limited.\n\nReally, though, their effect was curious. You noticed them casually,\nlet us say; then, without warning, you ceased to notice anything. You\nsimply grew foolish and gasped like a newly-hooked trout, and went mad\nand babbled as meaninglessly as a silly little rustic brook trotting\nunder a bridge.\n\nI have seen the thing happen any number of times. And, strangely\nenough, you liked it. Numbers of young men would venture into the same\nroom with those disconcerting eyes the very next evening, even\nappearing to seek them out and to court peril, as it were,--young men\nwho must have known perfectly well, either by report or experience,\nthe unavoidable result of such fool-hardy conduct. For eventually it\nalways culminated in Stella's being deeply surprised and grieved,--at\na dance, for choice, with music and color and the unthinking laughter\nof others to heighten the sadness and the romance of it all,--she\nnever having dreamed of such a thing, of course, and having always\nregarded you only as a dear, dear friend. Yes, and she used certainly\nto hope that nothing she had said or done could have led you to\nbelieve she had even for a moment considered such a thing. Oh, she did\nit well, did Stella, and endured these frequent griefs and surprises\nwith, I must protest, quite exemplary patience. In a phrase, she was\nthe most adorable combination of the prevaricator, the jilt and the\ncoquette I have ever encountered.\n\n\n 8\n\nSo, for the seventh time, I asked Stella to marry me. Nearly every\nfellow I knew had done as much, particularly Peter Blagden; and it is\nalways a mistake to appear unnecessarily reserved or exclusive. And\nthis time in declining--with a fluency that bespoke considerable\npractice,--she informed me that, as the story books have it, she was\nshortly to be wedded to another.\n\nAnd Peter Blagden clapped the pinnacle upon my anguish by asking me to\nbe the best man. I knew even then whose vanity and whose sense of the\nappropriate had put him up to it....\n\n\"For I haven't a living male relative of the suitable age except two\nsecond cousins that I don't see much of--praise God!\" said Peter,\nfervently; \"and Hugh Van Orden looks about half-past ten, whereas I\nclass John Charteris among the lower orders of vermin.\"\n\nI consented to accept the proffered office and the incidental stick-pin;\nand was thus enabled to observe from the inside this episode of Stella's\nlife, and to find it quite like other weddings.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n\"Look here,\" a perspiring and fidgety Peter protested, at the last\nmoment, as we lurked in the gloomy vestry with not a drop left in\neither flask; \"look here, Henderson hasn't blacked the soles of these\nblessed shoes. I'll look like an ass when it comes to the kneeling\npart--like an ass, I tell you! Good heavens, they'll look like\ntombstones!\"\n\n\"If you funk now,\" said I, severely, \"I'll never help you get married\nagain. Oh, sainted Ebenezer in bliss, and whatever have I done with\nthat ring? No, it's here all right, but you are on the wrong side of\nme again. And there goes the organ--Good God, Peter, look at her!\nsimply look at her, man! Oh, you lucky devil! you lucky jackass!\"\n\nI spoke enviously, you understand, simply to encourage him.\n\nFollowed a glaring of lights, a swishing of fans, a sense that Peter\nwas not keeping step with me, and the hum of densely packed, expectant\nhumanity; a blare of music; then Stella, an incredible vision with\nglad, frightened eyes. My shoulders straightened, and I was not out of\ntemper any longer. The organist was playing softly, _Oh, Promise Me_,\nand I was thinking of the time, last January, that Stella and I heard\nThe Bostonians, and how funny Henry Clay Barnabee was.... \"--so long\nas ye both may live?\" ended the bishop.\n\n\"I will,\" poor Peter quavered, with obvious uncertainty about it.\n\nAnd still one saw in Stella's eyes unutterable happiness and fear, but\nher voice was tranquil. I found time to wonder at its steadiness, even\nthough, just about this time, I resonantly burst a button off one of\nmy new gloves. I fancy they must have been rather tight.\n\n\"And thereto,\" said Stella, calmly, \"I give thee my troth.\"\n\nAnd subsequently they were Mendelssohned out of church to the\nsatisfaction of a large and critical audience. I came down the aisle\nwith Stella's only sister--who afterward married the Marquis\nd'Arlanges,--and found Lizzie very entertaining later in the\nevening....\n\n\n 9\n\nYes, it was quite like other weddings. I only wonder for what\nconceivable reason I remember its least detail, and so vividly. For it\nall happened a great while ago, when--of such flimsy stuff is glory\nwoven,--Emilio Aguinaldo and Captain Coghlan were the persons most\ntalked of in America; and when the Mazet committee was \"investigating\"\nI forget what, but with column after column about it in the papers\nevery day; and when _Me und Gott_ was a famous poem, and \"to\nhobsonize\" was the most popular verb; and when I was twenty-one. _Sic\ntransit gloria mundi_, as it says in the back of the dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n_He Talks with Charteris_\n\n\nIt was upon the evening of this day, after Mr. and Mrs. Blagden had\nbeen duly rice-pelted and entrained, that I first talked against John\nCharteris. The novelist was, as has been said, a cousin of Peter\nBlagden, and as such, was one of the wedding guests at Bellemeade; and\nthat evening, well toward midnight, the little man, midway in the\nconsumption of one of his interminable cigarettes, happened to come\nupon me seated upon the terrace and gazing, rather vacantly, in the\ndirection of the moon.\n\nI was not thinking of anything in particular; only there was a by-end\nof verse which sang itself over and over again, somewhere in the back\nof my brain--\"Her eyes were the eyes of a bride whom delight makes\nafraid, her eyes were the eyes of a bride\"--and so on, all over again,\nas at night a traveller may hear his train jogging through a\nmonotonous and stiff-jointed song; and in my heart there was just\nhunger.\n\n\n 2\n\nCharteris had heard, one may presume, of my disastrous love-business;\nand with all an author's relish of emotion, in others, chose his\ngambit swiftly. \"Mr. Townsend, is it not? Then may a murrain light\nupon thee, Mr. Townsend,--whatever a murrain may happen to be,--since\nyou have disturbed me in the concoction of an ever-living and\nentrancing fable.\"\n\n\"I may safely go as far,\" said I, \"as to offer the proverbial penny.\"\n\n\"Done!\" cried Mr. Charteris. He meditated for a moment, and then\nbegan, in a low and curiously melodious voice, to narrate\n\n_The Apologue of the First Conjugation_\n\n\"When the gods of Hellas were discrowned, there was a famous scurrying\nfrom Olympos to the world of mortals, where each deity must\nhenceforward make shift to do without godhead:--Aphrodite in her\nhollow hill, where the good knight Tannhauser revels yet, it may be;\nHephaestos, in some smithy; whilst Athene, for aught I know,\nestablished a girls' boarding school, and Helios, as is notorious,\ndied under priestly torture, and Dionysos cannily took holy orders,\nand Hermes set up as a merchant in Friesland. But Eros went to the\nGrammarians. He would be a schoolmaster.\n\n\"The Grammarians, grim, snuffy and wrinkled though they might be, were\nno more impervious to his allures than are the rest of us, and in\nconsequence appointed him to an office. This office was, I glean of\nmediaeval legend, that of teaching dunderheaded mortals the First\nConjugation. So Eros donned cap and gown, took lodgings with a quiet\nmusical family, and set _amo_ as the first model verb; and ever since\nthis period has the verb 'to love' been the first to be mastered in\nall well-constituted grammars, as it is in life.\n\n\"Heigho! it is not an easy verb to conjugate. One gets into trouble\nenough, in floundering through its manifold nuances, which range\ninevitably through the bold-faced 'I love', the confident 'I will\nlove', the hopeful 'I may be loved', and so on to the wistful, pitiful\nPluperfect Subjunctive Passive, 'I might have been loved\nif'--Then each of us may supply the Protasis as best befits his\npersonal opinion and particular scars, and may tear his hair, or\nscribble verses, or adopt the cynical, or, in fine, assume any pose\nwhich strikes his fancy. For he has graduated into the Second\nConjugation, which is _moneo_; and may now admonish to his heart's\ncontent, whilst looking back complacently into the First Classroom,\nwhere others--and so many others!--are still struggling with that\nmischancy verb, and are involved in the very conditions--verbal or\notherwise--which aforetime saddened him, or showed him a possible\nbyway toward recreation, or played the deuce with his liver, according\nto the nature of the man.\n\n\"Eros is a hard, implacable pedagogue, and for the fact his scholars\nsuffer. He wields a rod rather than a filigree bow, as old romancers\nfabled,--no plaything, but a most business-like article, well-poised\nin the handle, and thence tapering into graceful, stinging\nnothingness; and not a scholar escapes at least a flick of it.\n\n\"I can fancy the class called up as Eros administers, with zest, his\npenalties. Master Paris! for loving his neighbor a little less than\nhimself, and his neighbor's wife a little more. Master Lancelot!\nditto. Masters Petrarch, Tristram, Antony, Juan Tenorio, Dante\nAlighieri, and others! ditto. There are a great many called up for\nthis particular form of peccancy, you observe; even Master David has\nto lay aside his Psalm Book, and go forward with the others for\nchastisement. Master Romeo! for trespassing in other people's gardens\nand mausoleums. Master Leander! for swimming in the Hellespont after\ndark; and Master Tarquin! for mistaking his bedroom at the Collatini's\nhouse-party.\n\n\"Thus, one by one, each scholar goes into the darkened private office.\nThe master handles his rod--eia! 'tis borrowed from the\nErinnyes,--lovingly, caressingly, like a very conscientious person\nabout the performance of his duty. Then comes the dreadful order,\n'Take down your breeches, sir!'.... But the scene is too horrible to\ncontemplate. He punishes all, this schoolmaster, for he is\nunbelievably old, and with the years' advance has grown querulous.\n\n\"Well, now I approach my moral, Mr. Townsend. One must have one's\nbirching with the others, and of necessity there remains but to make\nthe best of it. Birching is not a dignified process, and the endurer\ncomes therefrom both sore and shamefaced. Yet always in such\ncontretemps it is expedient to brazen out the matter, and to present\nas stately an appearance, we will say, as one's welts permit.\n\n\"First, to the world--\"\n\n\n 3\n\nBut at this point I raised my hand. \"That is easily done, Mr.\nCharteris, inasmuch as the world cares nothing whatever about it. The\nworld is composed of men and women who have their own affairs to mind.\nHow in heaven's name does it concern them that a boy has dreamed\ndreams and has gone mad like a star-struck moth? It was foolish of\nhim. Such is the verdict, given in a voice that is neither kindly nor\nsevere; and the world, mildly wondering, passes on to deal with more\nweighty matters. For vegetables are higher than ever this year, and,\nupon my word, Mrs. Grundy, ma'am, a housekeeper simply doesn't know\nwhere to turn, with the outrageous prices they are asking for\neverything these days. No, believe me, the world does not take\nlove-affairs very seriously--not even the great ones,\" I added, in\nnoble toleration.\n\nAnd with an appreciative chuckle, Charteris sank beside me upon the\nbench.\n\n\"My adorable boy! so you have a tongue in your head.\"\n\n\"But can't you imagine the knights talking over Lancelot's affair with\nGuenevere, at whatever was the Arthurian substitute for a club? and\nsniggering over it? and Lamoracke sagaciously observing that there was\nalways a crooked streak in the Leodograunce family? Or one Roman\nmatron punching a chicken in the ribs, and remarking to her neighbor\nat the poultry man's stall: 'Well, Mrs. Gracchus, they do say Antony\nis absolutely daft over that notorious Queen of Egypt. A brazen-faced\nthing, with a very muddy complexion, I'm told, and practically no\nreputation, of course, after the way she carried on with Caesar. And\nthat reminds me, I hear your little Caius suffers from the croup. Now\n_my_ remedy'--and so they waddle on, to price asparagus.\"\n\nCharteris said: \"Well! we need not go out of our way to meddle with\nthe affairs of others; the entanglement is most disastrously apt to\ncome about of itself quite soon enough. Yet a little while and\nLancelot will be running Lamoracke through the body, while the King\nstorms Joyeuse Garde; a few months and your Roman matron will weep\nquietly on her unshared pillow--not aloud, though, for fear of\ndisturbing the children,--while Gracchus is dreadfully seasick at\nActium.\"\n\n\"But that doesn't prove anything,\" I stammered. \"Why, it doesn't\nfollow logically--\"\n\n\"Nor does anything else. This fact is the chief charm of life. You\nwill presently find, I think, that living means a daily squandering of\ninterest upon the first half of a number of two-part stories which\nhave not ever any sequel. Oh, my adorable boy, I envy you to-night's\nmisery so profoundly I am half unwilling to assure you that in the\nultimate one finds a broken heart rather fattening than otherwise; and\nthat a blighted life has never yet been known to prevent queer\nhappenings in conservatories and such-like secluded places or to rob a\nsolitude _a deux_ of possibilities. I grant you that love is a\nwonderful thing; but there are a many emotions which stand toward love\nmuch as the makers of certain marmalades assert their wares to stand\ntoward butter--'serving as an excellent occasional substitute.' At\nleast, so you will find it. And unheroic as it is, within the month\nyou will forget.\"\n\n\"No,--I shall not quite forget,\" said I.\n\n\"Then were you the more unwise. To forget, both speedily and\nfrequently, is the sole method of rendering life livable. One is here;\nthe importance of the fact in the eternal scheme of things is perhaps\na shade more trivial than one is disposed to concede, but in any\nevent, one is here; and here, for a very little while in youth, one is\ncapable of happiness. For it is a colorful world, Mr. Townsend,\ncontaining much, upon the whole, to captivate both eye and taste; a\nworld manured and fertilized by the no longer lovely bodies of persons\nwho died in youth. Oh, their coffins lie everywhere beneath our feet,\nthick as raisins in a pudding, whithersoever we tread. Yet every one\nof these poor relics was once a boy or a girl, and wore a body that\nwas capable of so much pleasure! To-day, unused to gain the fullness\nof that pleasure, and now not ever to be used, they lie beneath us, in\ntheir coffins, these white, straight bodies, like swords untried that\nrust in the scabbard. Meanwhile, on every side is apparent the not yet\nout-wasted instrument, and one is naturally inquisitive,--so that\none's fingers and one's nostrils twitch at times, even in the hour\nwhen one is most miserable, very much as yours do now.\"\n\nFor a long while I meditated. Then I said: \"I am not really miserable,\nbecause, all in all, one is content to pay the price of happiness. I\nhave been very happy sometimes during the past year; and whatever the\nblind Fate that mismanages the world may elect to demand in payment, I\nshall not haggle. No, by heavens! I would have nothing changed, and\nleast of all would I forget; having drunk nectar neat, one would not\nqualify it with the water of Lethe.\"\n\nI rose, not unhandsome, I trusted, in the moonlight. I was hoping Mr.\nCharteris would notice my new dress-suit, procured in honor of\nStella's wedding. And I said: \"The play is over, the little comedy is\nplayed out. She must go; at least she has tarried for a little. She\ndoes not love you; ah! but she did. God speed her, then, the woman we\nhave all loved and lost, and still dream of on sleepy Sundays; and all\npossible happiness to her! One must be grateful that through her one\nhas known the glory of loving. Even though she never cared--'and never\ncould understand',--one may not but be glad that one has known and\nloved in youth the Only Woman.\"\n\n\"The Only Woman has a way of leaving many heirs, Mr. Townsend, that\nplay the deuce with the estate.\"\n\n\"--So to-morrow, like the person in _Lycidas_, I am for fresh fields,\nMr. Charteris. And indeed it is high time that I were journeying,\nsince she and I have rested, and have laughed and eaten and drunk our\nfill at this particular tavern; and now it is closing time. A plague\non these foolish and impertinent laws, say I quite heartily; for it is\ncold and cheerless outside, whereas here within I was perfectly\ncomfortable. None the less I must go, or else be evicted by the\nconstable; so good-night, my sweet; and as for you, Madam Clotho, pray\nwhat unconscionable score have you chalked up against me?\"\n\nI grimaced. \"Heavens! what an infinity of sighs, sonnets,\nlamentations, and heart-burnings is this that I owe to Fate and\nDecency!\"\n\nCharteris applauded as though it were a comedy. \"In effect, Marian's\nmarried and you stand here, alive and merry at--pray what precise\nperiod of life, Mr. Townsend?\"\n\n\"I confess to twenty-one at present, sir, though I trust to live it\ndown in time.\"\n\n\"I would hardly have thought you that venerable. Well, I predict for\nyou a life without achievements but of gusto. Yes, you will bring a\nseasoned palate to your grave,--and I envy you. We open Willoughby\nHall next week, and of course you will make one of the party. For you\nwrite, I know; and you will want to talk to me about editors and read\nme all your damnable verses. Nothing could please me more. Good-night,\nyou glorious boy.\"\n\nAnd the little man wheeled and departed, leaving me to reflect, with\nappropriate emotions, that I had been formally invited to visit the\nfounder of the Economist school of writers.\n\n\n 4\n\n\"He said it,\" I more lately observed--\"yes, he undoubtedly said it.\nAnd he wrote _Ashtaroth's Lackey_ and _In Old Lichfield_ and _The\nFoolish Prince_, and he knows all the magazine editors personally, and\nthey are probably only too glad to oblige him about anything, and--Oh,\nmay be, it is only a dream, after all.\" My heart was pounding, but not\nwith sorrow or despair or any other maudlin passion; and Stella was\nnow as remote from my thoughts as was Joan of Arc or Pharaoh's\ndaughter.\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n_He Revisits Fairhaven and the Play_\n\n\nSo I went to Willoughby Hall, which stands, as you may be aware, upon\nthe eastern outskirt of Fairhaven. My reappearance created some stir\namong the older students and the town-folk, though, one and all, they\npresently declared me to be \"too stuck-up for any use,\" inasmuch as I\nignored them in favour of the Charteris house-party,--after, of\ncourse, one visit to Chapel, which I paid a little obviously _en\nprince_, and affably shook hands with all the Faculty, and was\ncompletely conscious of how such happenings impressed us when I, too,\nwas a student.\n\nSo much had happened since then, and I felt so much older,--with my\nexistence so delightfully blighted, too,--that it seemed droll to find\nColonel Snawley and Dr. Jeal still sitting in arm chairs before\nClarriker's Emporium, very much as I had left them there ten months\nago.\n\n\n 2\n\nBy a disastrous chance did Bettie Hamlyn spend that spring, as well as\nthe preceding year, in Colorado with her mother, who died there that\nsummer; and to me Fairhaven proper without Bettie Hamlyn seemed a\ntawdry and desolate place; and I know that but for Mrs. Hamlyn's\nillness--a querulous woman for whom I never cared a jot,--my future\nlife had been quite otherwise. For, as I told Bettie once, and it was\ntrue, I have found in the world but three sorts of humanity--\"Myself,\nand Bettie Hamlyn, and the other people.\"\n\nSo I still wrote to Bettie Hamlyn on the seventh of every month--\nbecause that was her birthday,--and again on the twenty-third, because\nthat was mine.\n\nAnd I thought of many things as I walked by the deserted garden, where\nthere was nothing which concerned me now, not even a ghost. I did not\ngo in to leave a card upon Professor Hamlyn. The empty house\nconfronted me too blankly, with its tight-shuttered windows, like\nblind eyes, and I hurried by.\n\n\n 3\n\nMeanwhile, this was the first time for many years that Willoughby Hall\nhad been occupied by any other than caretakers; and Fairhaven, to\nconfess the truth, was a trifle ill-at-ease before the modish persons\nwho now tenanted the old mansion; and consoled itself after an\nimmemorial usage by backbiting.\n\nAnd meanwhile I enjoyed myself tremendously. It was the first time I\nwas ever thrown with people who were unanimously agreed that, after\nall, nothing is very serious. Mrs. Charteris, of course, was\ndifferent; but she, like the others, found me divertingly naive and,\nin consequence, petted and cosseted me. I like petting; and since\neveryone seemed agreed to regard me as \"the Child in the House\"--that\nwas Alicia Wade's nickname, and it clung,--and to like having a child\nin the house, I began a little to heighten my very real boyishness.\nThere was no harm in it; and if people were fonder of me because I sat\nupon the floor by preference, and drolly exaggerated what I really\nthought, it became a sort of public duty to do these things. So I did,\nand found it astonishingly pleasant.\n\n\n 4\n\nAnd meanwhile too, John Charteris could never see enough of me, whom,\nas I to-day suspect, Charteris was studying conscientiously, to the\nend that I should be converted into \"copy.\" For me, I was waiting\ncannily until he should actually ask to see those manuscripts I had\nbrought to Willoughby Hall, and should help me to get them published.\nSo there were two of us.... In any event, it was just three weeks\nafter Stella's marriage that Charteris coaxed me into Fairhaven's\nOpera House to witness a performance of _Romeo and Juliet_, by the\nImperial Dramatic Company.\n\nI went under protest; I had witnessed the butchery of so many dramas\nwithin these walls during my college days, that I knew what I must\nanticipate, I said. I had, as a matter of fact, always enjoyed the\nOpera House \"shows,\" but I did not wish to acknowledge the harboring\nof such crude tastes to Charteris. In any event, at the conclusion of\nthe second act,--\n\n\"By Jove!\" said I, in a voice that shook a little. \"She's a stunner!\"\nI jolted out, as I proceeded to applaud, vigorously, with both hands and\nfeet. \"And who would have thought it! Good Lord, who would have\nthought it!\"\n\nCharteris smiled, in that infernally patronizing way he had sometimes.\n\"A beautiful woman, my dear boy,--an inordinately beautiful woman, in\nfact, but entirely lacking in temperament.\"\n\n\"Temperament!\" I scoffed; \"what's temperament to two eyes like those?\nWhy, they're as big as golf-balls! And her voice--why, a violin--a\nvery superior violin--if it could talk, would have just such a voice\nas that woman has! Temperament! Oh, you make me ill! Why, man, just\nlook at her!\" I said, conclusively.\n\nCharteris looked, I presume. In any event, the Juliet of the evening\nstood before the curtain, smiling, bowing to right and left. The\ncitizens of Fairhaven were applauding her with a certain conscientious\nindustry, for they really found Romeo and Juliet a rather dull couple.\nThe general opinion, however, was that Miss Montmorenci seemed an\nelegant actress, and in some interesting play, like _The Two Orphans_\nor _Lady Audley's Secret_, would be well worth seeing. Upon those who\nhad witnessed her initial performance, she had made a most favorable\nimpression in _The Lady of Lyons_; while at the Tuesday matinee, as\nLady Isabel in _East Lynne_, she had wrung the souls of her hearers,\nand had brought forth every handkerchief in the house. Moreover, she\nwas very good-looking,--quite the lady, some said; and, after all, one\ncannot expect everything for twenty-five cents; considering which\ncircumstances, Fairhaven applauded with temperate ardor, and made due\nallowance for Shakespeare as being a classic, and, therefore, of\ncourse, commendable, but not necessarily interesting.\n\n\n 5\n\n\"Well?\" I queried, when she had vanished. I was speaking under cover\nof the orchestra,--a courtesy title accorded a very ancient and very\nfeeble piano. \"Well, and what do you think of her--of her looks, I\nmeans? Who cares for temperament in a woman!\"\n\nCharteris assumed a virtuous expression. \"I don't dare tell you,\" said\nhe; \"you forget I am a married man.\"\n\nThen I frowned a little. I often resented Charteris's flippant\nallusion to a wife whom I considered, with some reason, to be vastly\ntoo good for her husband. And I considered how near I had come to\nremaining with the others at Willoughby Hall--for that new game they\ncalled bridge-whist! And I decided I would never care for bridge. How\non earth could presumably sensible people be content to coop\nthemselves in a drawing-room on a warm May evening, when hardly a\nmile away was a woman with perfectly unfathomable eyes and a voice\nwhich was a love-song? Of course, she couldn't act, but, then, who\nwanted her to act? I indignantly demanded of my soul.\n\nOne simply wanted to look at her, and hear her speak. Charteris, with\nhis prattle about temperament, was an ass; when a woman is born with\nsuch eyes and with a voice like that, she has done her full duty by\nthe world, and has prodigally accomplished all one has the tiniest\nright to expect of her.\n\nIt was impossible she was in reality as beautiful as she seemed,\nbecause no woman was quite so beautiful as that; most of it was\nundoubtedly due to rouge and rice-powder and the footlights; but one\ncould not be mistaken about the voice. And if her speech was that,\nwhat must her singing be! I thought; and in the outcome I remembered\nthis reflection best of all.\n\nI consulted my programme. It informed me, in large type at the end,\nthat Juliet was \"old Capulet's daughter,\" and that the part was played\nby Miss Annabelle Alys Montmorenci.\n\nAnd I sighed. I admitted to myself that from a woman who wilfully\nassumed such a name little could be hoped. Still, I would like to see\nher off the stage...without all those gaudy fripperies and\ngewgaws...merely from curiosity.... Then too, they said those\nactresses were pretty gay....\n\n\n 6\n\n\"A most enjoyable performance,\" said Mr. Charteris, as we came out of\nthe Opera House. \"I have always had a sneaking liking for burlesque.\"\n\nThereupon he paused to shake hands with Mrs. Adrian Rabbet, wife to\nthe rector of Fairhaven.\n\n\"Such a sad play,\" she chirped, \"and, do you know, I am afraid it is\nrather demoralizing in its effects on young people. No, of course, I\ndidn't think of bringing the children, Mr. Charteris--Shakespeare's\nlanguage is not always sufficiently obscure, you know, to make that\nsafe. And besides, as I so often say to Mr. Rabbet, it is sad to think\nof our greatest dramatist having been a drinking man. It quite\ndepressed me all through the play to think of him hobnobbing with Dr.\nJohnson at the Tabard Inn, and making such irregular marriages, and\nstealing sheep--or was it sheep, now?\"\n\nI said that, as I remembered, it was a fox, which he hid under his\ncloak until the beast bit him.\n\n\"Well, at any rate, it was something extremely deplorable and\ncharacteristic of genius, and I quite feel for his wife.\" Mrs. Rabbet\nsighed, and endeavored, I think, to recollect whether it was _Ingomar_\nor _Spartacus_ that Shakespeare wrote. \"However,\" she concluded, \"they\nplay _Ten Nights in a Barroom_ on Thursday, and I shall certainly\nbring the children then, for I am always glad for them to see a really\nmoral and instructive drama. That reminds me! I absolutely must tell\nyou what Tom said about actors the other day--\"\n\nAnd she did. This led naturally to Matilda's recent and blasphemous\ncomments on George Washington, and her observations as to the rector's\ndog, and little Adey's personal opinion of Elisha. And so on, in a\nmanner not unfamiliar to fond parents. Mrs. Rabbet said toward the end\nthat it was a most enjoyable chat, although to me it appeared to\npartake rather of the nature of a monologue. It consumed perhaps a\nhalf-hour; and when we two at last relinquished Mrs. Rabbet to her\nhusband's charge, it was with a feeling not altogether unakin to\nrelief.\n\n\n 7\n\nWe walked slowly down Fairhaven's one real street, which extends due\neast from the College for as much as a mile, to end inconsequently in\nthose carefully preserved foundations, which are now the only remnant\nof a building wherein a number of important matters were settled in\nColonial days. There Cambridge Street divides like a Y, one branch of\nwhich leads to Willoughby Hall.\n\nOur route from the Opera House thus led through the major part of\nFairhaven, which, after an evening of unwonted dissipation, was now\nlargely employed in discussing the play, and turning the cat out for\nthe night. The houses were mostly dark, and the moon, nearing its\nfull, silvered row after row of blank windows. There was an odour of\ngrowing things about, for in Fairhaven the gardens are many.\n\nThen it befell that I made a sudden exclamation.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Charteris.\n\n\"Why, nothing,\" I explained, lucidly.\n\nIt may be mentioned, however, that we were, at this moment, passing a\ntall hedge of box, set about a large garden. The hedge was perhaps\nfive feet six in height; Charteris was also five feet six, whereas I\nwas an unusually tall young man, and topped my host by a good\nhalf-foot.\n\n\"I say,\" I observed, after a little, \"I'm all out of cigarettes. I'll\ngo back to the drug-store,\" I suggested, as seized with a happy\nthought, \"and get some. I noticed it was still open. Don't think of\nwaiting for me,\" I urged, considerately.\n\n\"Why, great heavens!\" Charteris ejaculated; \"take one of mine. I can\nrecommend them, I assure you--and, in any event, there are all sorts,\nI fancy, at the house. They keep only the rankest kind of domestic\ntobacco yonder.\"\n\n\"I prefer it,\" I insisted, \"oh, yes, I really prefer it. So much\nmilder and more wholesome, you know. I never smoke any other sort. My\ndoctor insists on my smoking the very rankest tobacco I can get. It is\nmuch better for the heart, he says, because you don't smoke so much of\nit, you know. Besides,\" I concluded, virtuously, \"it is infinitely\ncheaper; you can get twenty cigarettes all for five cents at some\nplaces. I really must economize, I think.\"\n\nCharteris turned, and with great care stared in every direction. He\ndiscovered nothing unusual. \"Very well!\" assented Mr. Charteris; \"I,\ntoo, have an eye for bargains. I will go with you.\"\n\n\"If you do alive,\" quoth I, quite honestly, \"I devoutly desire that\nall sorts of unpleasant things may happen to me for not having wrung\nyour neck first.\"\n\nCharteris grinned. \"Immoral young rip!\" said he; \"I warn you, before\nentering the ministry, Mr. Rabbet was accounted an excellent shot.\"\n\n\"Get out!\" said I.\n\nAnd the fervour of my utterance was such that Charteris proceeded to\nobey. \"Don't be late for breakfast, if you can help it,\" he urged,\nkindly. \"Of course, though, you are up to some new form of insanity,\nand I shall probably be sent for in the morning, to bail you out of\nthe lock-up.\"\n\nThereupon he turned on his heel, and went down the deserted street,\nsinging sweetly.\n\nSang Mr. Charteris:\n\n  \"Curly gold locks cover foolish brains,\n  Billing and cooing is all your cheer,\n  Sighing and singing of midnight strains\n  Under bonnybells\" window-panes.\n  Wait till you've come to forty year!\n\n \"Forty times over let Michaelmas pass,\n  Grizzling hair the brain doth clear;\n  Then you know a boy is an ass,\n  Then you know the worth of a lass,\n  Once you have come to forty-year.\"\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\n_He Chats Over a Hedge_\n\n\nLeft to myself, I began to retrace my steps. Solitude had mitigated my\ncraving for tobacco in a surprising manner; indeed, a casual observer\nmight have thought it completely forgotten, for I walked with curious\nleisure. When I had come again to the box-hedge my pace had\ndegenerated, a little by a little, into an aimless lounge. Mr. Robert\nEtheridge Townsend was rapt with admiration of the perfect beauty of\nthe night.\n\nFollowed a strange chance. There was only the mildest breeze about; it\nwas barely audible among the leaves above; and yet--so unreliable are\nthe breezes of still summer nights,--with a sudden, tiny and almost\nimperceptible outburst, did this treacherous breeze lift Mr.\nTownsend's brand-new straw hat from his head, and waft it over the\nhedge of trim box-bushes. This was unfortunate, for, as has been said,\nthe hedge was a tall and sturdy hedge. So I peeped over it, with\ndisconsolate countenance.\n\n\n 2\n\n\"Beastly awkward,\" said I, as meditatively; \"I'd give a great deal to\nknow how I'm going to get my hat back without breaking through the\nblessed hedge, and rousing the house, and being taken for a burglar,\nmay be--\"\n\n\"It is terrible,\" assented a quite tranquil voice; \"but if gentlemen\n_will_ venture abroad on such terrible nights--\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said I. I looked up quickly at the moon; then back toward the\npossessor of the voice. It was peculiar I had not noticed her before,\nfor she sat on a rustic bench not more than forty feet away, and in\nfull view of the street. It was, perhaps, the strangeness of the\naffair that was accountable for the great wonder in my soul; and the\nlittle tremor which woke in my speech.\n\n\"--so windy,\" she complained.\n\n\"Er--ah--yes, quite so!\" I agreed, hastily.\n\n\"I am really afraid that it must be a tornado. Ah,\" she continued,\nemotion catching at her voice, \"heaven help all poor souls at sea! How\nthe wind must whistle through the cordage! how the marlin-spikes must\nquiver, and the good ship reel on such a night!\" She looked up at a\ncloudless sky, and sighed.\n\n\"Er h'm!\" I observed.\n\nFor she had come forward and had held out my hat toward me, and I\ncould see her very plainly now; and my mouth was making foolish\nsounds, and my heart was performing certain curious and varied\ngymnastics which could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be\nincluded among its proper duties, and which interfered with my\nbreathing.\n\n\n 3\n\n\"Didn't I know it--didn't I know it?\" I demanded of my soul, and my\npulses sang a paean; \"I knew, with that voice, she couldn't be a\ncommon actress--a vulgar, raddled creature out of a barn! You not a\ngentlewoman! Nonsense! Why--why, you're positively incredible! Oh, you\ngreat, wonderful, lazy woman, you are probably very stupid, and you\ncertainly can't act, but your eyes are black velvet, and your voice is\nevidently stolen from a Cremona, and as for your hair, there must be\npounds of it, and, altogether, you ought to be set up on a pedestal\nfor men to worship! There is just one other woman in the whole wide\nworld as beautiful as you are; and she is two thousand years old, and\nis securely locked up in the Louvre, and belongs to the French\nGovernment, and, besides, she hasn't any arms, so that even there you\nhave the advantage!\"\n\nIndeed, Miss Annabelle Alys Montmorenci was of much the same large,\nplacid type as the Venus of Milo, nor were the upper portions of the\ntwo faces dissimilar. Miss Montmorenci's lips, however, were far more\ncurved, more buxom, and were, at the present moment, bordered by an\nabsolutely bewildering assemblage of dimples which the statue may not\nboast.\n\n\n 4\n\n\"I really think,\" said Miss Montmorenci, judicially, \"that it would be\nbest for you to seek some shelter from this devastating wind. It\nreally is not safe, you know, in the open. You might be swept away,\njust as your hat was.\"\n\n\"The shelter of a tree--\" I began, looking doubtfully into the garden,\nwhich had any number of trees.\n\n\"The very thing,\" she assented. \"There is a splendid oak yonder, just\nhalf a block up the street.\" And she graciously pointed it out.\n\nI regarded it with disapproval. \"Such a rickety old tree,\" I objected,\nsulkily.\n\nFollowed a silence. She bent her head to one side, and looked up at\nme. She was now grave with a difference. \"A strolling actress isn't\nsupposed to be very particular, is she?\" asked Miss Montmorenci. \"She\nwouldn't object to a man's coming by night and trying to scrape\nacquaintance with her,--a man who wouldn't think of being seen with\nher by day? She would like it, probably. She--she'd probably be\naccustomed to it, wouldn't she?\" And Miss Montmorenci smiled.\n\nAnd I, on a sudden, was abjectly ashamed of myself. \"Why, you can't\nthink that of me!\" I babbled. \"I--oh, don't think me that sort, I beg\nof you! I'm not--really, I'm not, Miss Montmorenci! But I admired you\nso much to-night--I--oh, of course, I was very silly and very\npresumptuous, but, really, you know--\"\n\nI paused for a little. This was miles apart from the glib talk I had\ndesigned.\n\n\"My name is Robert Townsend,\" I then continued; \"I am staying at Mr.\nCharteris's place, just outside of Fairhaven. And I am delighted to\nmeet you, Miss Montmorenci. So now, you see, we have been quite\nproperly introduced, haven't we? And, by the way,\" I suggested, after\na moment's meditation, \"there is a very interesting old college here--\nold pictures, records, historical association and such like. I would\nlike to inspect it, vastly. Can't I call for you in the morning. We\ncan do it together, if you don't mind, and if you haven't already seen\nit. Won't you, Miss Montmorenci? You really ought to see King's\nCollege, you know; it is quite famous, because I was educated there,\nand no end of other interesting things have happened within its\nvenerable confines.\"\n\nShe had drawn close to the hedge. \"You really mean it?\" she asked.\n\"You would walk through the streets of this Fairhaven with me--with a\nbarn-stormer, with a strolling actress? You'd be afraid!\" she cried,\nsuddenly; \"oh, yes, you talk bravely enough, but you'd be afraid, of\ncourse, when the time came! You'd be afraid!\"\n\nI had taken the hat, but my head was still uncovered. \"I don't think,\"\nsaid I, reflectively, \"that I am afraid of many things, somehow. But\nof one thing I am certainly not afraid, and that is of mistaking a\ngood woman for--for anything else. Their eyes are different somehow,\"\nI haltingly explained, as to myself; then I smiled. \"Shall we say\neleven o'clock?\"\n\nMiss Montmorenci laid one hand upon the hedgetop and slowly twisted\noff four box-leaves what while I waited. \"I--I believe you,\" she said,\nin' meditation; \"oh, yes, I believe you, somehow, Mr. Townsend. But we\nrehearse in the morning, and there is a matinee every day, you know,\nand--and there are other reasons--\" She paused, irresolutely. \"No,\"\nsaid Miss Montmorenci, \"I thank you, but--good night.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say! am I never to see any more of you?\"\n\nA century or so of silence now. Her deliberation seemed endless.\n\nAt last: \"Matinees and rehearsal keep us busy by day. But I am\nboarding here for the week, and--and I rest here in the garden after\nthe evening performance. It is cool, it--it is like a glass of water\nafter taking rather bitter medicine. And you aren't a bad sort, are\nyou? No; you look too big and strong and clean, Mr. Townsend. And,\nbesides, you're just a boy--\"\n\n\"In that case,\" cried Mr. Townsend, \"I shall say goodnight with a\nlight heart.\" And I turned to go.\n\n\"A moment--\" said she.\n\n\"An eternity,\" I proffered.\n\n\"Promise me,\" she said, \"that you will not come again this week to the\nOpera House.\"\n\nMy brows were raised a trifle. \"I adore the drama,\" I pleaded.\n\n\"And I loathe it. And I act very badly--hopelessly so,\" said Miss\nMontmorenci, with an indolent shrug; \"and, somehow, I don't want you\nto see me do it. Why did you mind my calling you a boy? You _are_, you\nknow.\"\n\nSo I protested I had not minded it at all; and I promised. \"But at\nleast,\" I said, triumphantly, \"you can't prevent my remembering\nJuliet!\"\n\nShe said of course not, only I was not to be silly.\n\n\"And therefore,\" quoth I, \"Juliet shall be remembered always.\" I\nsmiled and waved my hand. \"_Au revoir_, Signorina Capulet,\" said I.\n\nAnd I took my departure. My blood rejoiced, with a strange fervor, in\nthe summer moonlight. It was good to be alive.\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\n_He Goes Mad in a Garden_\n\n\n\"And, oh, but it is good to be with you again, Signorina!\" cried I, as\nI came with quick strides into the moonlit garden. I caught both her\nhands in mine, and laughed like an ineffably contented person. There\nwas nothing very subtle about the boy that then was I; at worst, he\noveracted what he really felt; and just at present he was pleased with\nthe universe, and he saw no possible reason for concealing the fact.\n\nIt was characteristic, also, that she made no pretence at being\nsurprised by my coming. She was expecting me and she smiled very\nfrankly at seeing me. Also, in place of the street dress of Tuesday,\nshe wore something that was white and soft and clinging, and left her\nthroat but half concealed. This, for two reasons, was sensible and\npraiseworthy; one being that the night was warm, and the other that it\nreally broadened my ideas as to the state of perfection which it is\npossible for the human throat to attain.\n\n\n 2\n\n\"So you don't like my stage-name?\" she asked, as I sat down beside\nher. \"Well, for that matter, no more do I.\" \"It doesn't suit you,\" I\nprotested--\"not in the least. Whereas, you might be a Signorina\nSomebody-or-other, you know. You are dark and stately and--well, I\ncan't tell you all the things you are,\" I complained, \"because the\nEnglish language is so abominably limited. But, upon the whole, I am\nwilling to take the word of the playbill,--yes, I am quite willing to\naccept you as Signorina Capulet. She had a habit of sitting in gardens\nat night, I remember. Yes,\" I decided, after reflection, \"I really\nthink it highly probable that you are old Capulet's daughter. I shall\nmake a point of it to pick a quarrel as soon as possible, with that\nimpertinent, trespassing young Montague. He really doesn't deserve\nyou, you know.\"\n\nUnaccountably, her face saddened. Then, \"Signorina? Signorina?\" she\nappraised the title. \"It _is_ rather a pretty name. And the other is\nhorrible. Yes, you may call me Signorina, if you like.\"\n\n\n 3\n\nShe would not tell me her real name. She was unmarried,--this much she\ntold me, but of her past life, her profession, or of her future she\nnever spoke. \"I don't want to talk about it,\" she said, candidly. \"We\nplay for a week in Fairhaven, and here, once off the stage, I intend\nto forget I am an actress. When I am on the stage,\" she added, in\nmeditative wise, \"of course everyone knows I am not.\"\n\nI laughed. I found her very satisfying; she was not particularly\nintelligent, perhaps, but then I was beginning to consider clever\nwomen rather objectionable creatures. There was a sufficiency of them\namong the Charteris house-party--Alicia Wade, for instance, and\nPauline Ashmeade and Cynthia Chaytor,--and I thought of them almost\nresentfully. The world had accorded them not exactly what they most\nwanted, perhaps, but, at least, they had its luxuries; and they said\nsharp, cynical things about the world in return. In a woman's mouth\nepigrams were as much out-of-place as a meerschaum pipe.\n\nHere, on the contrary, was a woman whom the world had accorded nothing\nsave hard knocks, and she regarded it, upon the whole, as an eminently\npleasant place to live in. She accepted its rebuffs with a certain\nlarge calm, as being all in the day's work. There was, no doubt, some\ngood and sufficient reason for these inconveniences; not for a moment,\nhowever, did she puzzle her handsome head in speculating over this\nreason. She was probably too lazy. And the few favours the world\naccorded her she took thankfully.\n\n\"You see,\" she explained to me--this was on Thursday night, when I\nfound her contentedly eating cheap candy out of a paper bag,--\"the\nworld is really very like a large chocolate drop; it's rather bitter\non the outside, but when you have bitten through, you find the heart\nof it sweet. Oh, how greedy!--you've taken the last candied cherry,\nand I am specially fond of candied cherries!\" And indeed, she looked\nfrankly regretful as I munched it.\n\nI thought her adorable; and in exchange for that last candied cherry I\npromised her some of the new books,--_David Harum_ certainly, and,\n_When Knighthood Was in Flower_, because everybody was reading it, and\nMr. Dooley, because they said this young fellow Dunne was nearly as\nfunny as Bill Nye....\n\n\n 4\n\nIn fact, the moon seemed to shine down each night upon that particular\ngarden in a more and more delightful and dangerous manner. And I being\na fairly normal and healthy young man, the said moonshine affected me\nin a fashion which has been peculiar to moonshine since Noah was a\nlikely stripling; my blood appeared to me, at times, to leap and\nbubble in my veins as if it had been some notably invigorating and\nheady tipple; and my heart was unreasonably contented, and I gave due\nthanks for this woman who had come to me unsullied through the world's\ngutter. For she came unsullied; there was no questioning that.\n\nI pictured her in certain execrable rhymes as the Lady in _Comus_,\nmoving serene and unafraid among a rabble of threatening, bestial\nshapes. And I rejoiced that there were women like this in the world,--\nbrave, wholesome, unutterably honest women, whose very lack of\ncleverness--oh, subtle appeal to my vanity!--demanded a gentleman's\nprotection.\n\nAs has been said, I was a well-grown lad, but when I thought in this\nfashion I seemed to myself, at a moderate computation, ten feet in\nheight,--and just the person, in short, who would be an ideal\nprotector.\n\nThus far my callow meditations. My course of reasoning was perhaps\nfaulty, but then there are, at twenty-one, many processes more\ninteresting and desirable than the perfecting of a mathematical\ndemonstration. And so, for a little, my blood rejoiced with a strange\nfervour in the summer moonlight, and it was good to be alive.\n\n\n 5\n\nThursday was the twenty-third of the month, so upon that afternoon I\nwrote to Bettie Hamlyn, in far-off Colorado.\n\nIt was a lengthy letter. It told her of how desolate her garden was\nand of how odd Fairhaven seemed without her. It told how I had half\nchanged my mind, and would probably not go to Europe with Mr.\nCharteris, after all. Bettie had been at pains, in the letter I was\nanswering, to expatiate upon her hatred of Charteris, whom she had\nnever seen. My letter told her, in fine, of a variety of matters. And\nit ended:\n\n\"I went to the Opera House on Monday. But that, like everything else,\nisn't the same without you, dear. The woman who played Juliet was, I\nbelieve, rather good-looking, but I scarcely noticed her in worrying\nover the pitiful circumstance that the Apothecary and the Populace of\nVerona had only one pair of shoes between them. Besides, Mercutio kept\nputting on a bathrobe and insisting he was Friar Laurence.... I would\nwrite more about it, if I had not almost used up all my paper. There\nis just room to say--\"\n\n\n 6\n\nThis was, as I have stated, on Thursday afternoon. Upon the following\nevening--\n\n\"And why not?\" I demanded, for the ninth time.\n\nBut she was resolute. \"Oh, it is dear of you!\" she cried; \"and I--I do\ncare for you,--how could I help it? But it can't be,--it can't ever\nbe,\" she repeated wearily; and then she looked at me, and smiled a\nlittle. \"Oh, boy, boy! dear, dear boy!\" she murmured, half in wonder,\n\"how foolish of you and--how dear of you!\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said I--for the tenth time.\n\nShe gave a sobbing laugh. \"Oh, the great, brave, stupid boy!\" she\nsaid, and, for a moment, her hand rested on my hair; \"he doesn't know\nwhat he is doing,--ah, no, he doesn't know! Why, I might hold you to\nyour word! I might sue you for breach of promise! I might marry you\nout of hand! Think of that! Why I am only a strolling actress, and\nfair game for any man,--any man who isn't particular,\" she added, with\nthe first trace of bitterness I had ever observed in her odd, throaty\nvoice. \"And you would marry me,--you! you would give me your name, you\nwould make me your wife! You have actually begged me to be your wife,\nhaven't you? Ah, my brave, strong, stupid Bobbie, how many women must\nlove you,--women who have a right to love you! And you would give them\nall up for me,--for me, you foolish Bobbie, whom you haven't known a\nweek! Ah, how dear of you!\" And she caught her breath swiftly, and her\nvoice broke.\n\n\"Yes,\" I brazenly confessed; \"I really believe I would give them all\nup--every blessed one of them--for you.\" I inspected her, critically,\nand then smiled. \"And I don't think that I would be deserving any very\ngreat credit for self sacrifice, either, Signorina.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" she answered, \"it pleases you to call me old Capulet's\ndaughter,--but if I were only a Capulet, and you a Montague, don't you\nsee how much easier it would be? But we don't belong to rival\nfamilies, we belong to rival worlds, to two worlds that have nothing\nin common, and never can have anything in common. They are too strong\nfor us, Bobbie,--my big, dark, squalid world, that you could never\nsink to, and your gay little world which I can never climb to,--your\nworld that would have none of me, even if--even _if_--\" But the\ncondition was not forthcoming.\n\n\"The world,\" said I, in an equable tone--\"My dear, I may as well warn\nyou I am shockingly given to short and expressive terms, and as we are\nlikely to see a deal of each other for the future, you will have to be\nlenient with them,--accordingly, I repeat, the world may be damned.\"\n\nAnd I laughed, in unutterable content. \"Have none of you!\" I cried.\n\"My faith, I would like to see a world which would have none of you!\nAh, Signorina, it is very plain to me that you don't realize what a\nbeauty, what a--a--good Lord, what an unimaginative person it was that\ninvented the English language! Why, you have only to be seen, heart's\ndearest,--only to be seen, and the world is at your feet,--my world,\nto which you belong of rights; my world, that you are going to honour\nby living in; my world, that in a little will go mad for sheer envy of\nblundering, stupid, lucky me!\" And I laughed her to scorn.\n\nThere was a long silence. Then, \"I belonged to your world once, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Why, of course, I knew as much as that.\"\n\n\"And yet--you never asked--\" \"Ah, Signorina, Signorina!\" I cried;\n\"what matter? Don't I know you for the bravest, tenderest, purest,\nmost beautiful woman God ever made? I doubt you--I! My word!\" said I,\nand stoutly, \"that _would_ be a pretty go! You are to tell me just\nwhat you please,\" I went on, almost belligerently, \"and when and where\nyou please, my lady. And I would thank you,\" I added, with appropriate\nsternness, \"to discontinue your pitiful and transparent efforts to\narouse unworthy suspicions as to my future wife. They are wasted,\nmadam,--utterly wasted, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bobbie, Bobbie!\" she sighed; \"you are such a beautiful baby! Give\nme time,\" she pleaded weakly.\n\nAnd, when I scowled my disapproval, \"Only till tomorrow--only a\nlittle, little twenty-four hours. And promise me, you won't speak of\nthis--this crazy nonsense again tonight. I must think.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said I, promptly; \"because I couldn't be expected to keep\nsuch an absurd promise,\" I complained, in indignation.\n\n\"And you look so strong,\" she murmured, with evident disappointment,--\n\"so strong and firm and--and--admirable!\"\n\nSo I promised at once. And I kept the promise--that is, I did\nsubsequently refer to the preferable and proper course to pursue in\ndivers given circumstances \"when we are married;\" but it was on six\noccasions only, and then quite casually,--and six times, as I myself\nobserved, was, all things considered, an extremely moderate allowance\nand one that did great credit to my self-control.\n\n\n 7\n\n\"And besides, why _not_?\" I said,--for the eleventh time.\n\n\"There are a thousand reasons. I am not your equal, I am just an\nostensible actress--Why, it would be your ruin!\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Grundy, I confess that, for the moment, your disguise\nhad deceived me. But now: I recognize your voice.\"\n\nShe laughed a little. \"And after all,\" the grave voice said, which\nwas, to me at least, the masterwork of God, \"after all, hasn't one\nalways to answer Mrs. Grundy--in the end?\"\n\n\"Why, then, you disgusting old harridan,\" said I, \"I grant you it is\nutterly impossible to defend my behaviour in this matter, and, believe\nme, I don't for an instant undertake the task. To the contrary, I\nagree with you perfectly,--my conduct is most thoughtless and\nreprehensible, and merits your very severest condemnation. For look\nyou, here is a young man, well born, well-bred, sufficiently well\nendowed with this world's goods, in short, an eminently eligible\nmatch, preparing to marry an 'ostensible actress' a year or two his\nsenior,--why, of course, you are,--and of whose past he knows\nnothing,--absolutely nothing. Don't you shudder at the effrontery of\nthe minx? Is it not heart-breaking to contemplate the folly, the utter\ninfatuation of the misguided youth who now stands ready to foist such\na creature upon the circles of which your ladyship is a distinguished\nornament? I protest it is really incredible. I don't believe a word of\nit.\"\n\n\"I cannot quite believe it, either, Bobbie--\"\n\n\"But you see, he loves her. You, my dear madam, blessed with a wiser\nestimation of our duties to society, of the responsibilities of our\nposition, of the cost of even the most modest establishment, and,\nabove all, of the sacredness of matrimony and the main chance, may\nwell shrug your shoulders at such a plea. For, as you justly observe,\nwhat, after all, is this love? only a passing madness, an exploded\nsuperstition, an irresponsible _ignis fatuus_ flickering over the\nquagmires and shallows of the divorce court. People's lives are no\nlonger swayed by such absurdities; it is quite out of date.\"\n\n\"Yes; you are joking, Bobbie, I know; yet it is really out of date--\"\n\n\"But I protest, loudly, my hand upon my heart, that it is true; people\nno longer do mad things for love, or ever did, in spite of lying\npoets; any more than the birds mate in the spring, or the sun rises in\nthe morning; popular fallacies, my dear madam, every one of them. You\nand I know better, and are not to be deceived by appearances, however\nspecious they may be. Ah, but come now! Having attained this highly\nsatisfactory condition, we can well afford to laugh at all our past\nmistakes,--yes, even at our own! For let us be quite candid. Wasn't\nthere a time, dear lady, before Mr. Grundy came a-wooing, when,\nsomehow, one was constantly meeting unexpected people in the garden,\nand, somehow, one sat out a formidable number of dances during the\nevening, and, somehow, the poets seemed a bit more plausible than they\ndo today? It was very foolish, of course,--but, ah, madam, there _was_\na time,--a time when even our staid blood rejoiced with a strange\nfervour in the summer moonlight, and it was good to be alive! Come\nnow, have you the face to deny it,--Mrs. Methuselah?\"\n\n\"It has not been quite bad to be alive, these last few hours--\"\n\n\"And, oh, my dear, how each of us will look back some day to this very\nmoment! And we are wasting it! And I have not any words to tell you\nhow I love you! I am just a poor, dumb brute!\" I groaned.\n\nThen very tenderly she began to talk with me in a voice I cannot tell\nyou of, and concerning matters not to be recorded.\n\nAnd still she would not promise anything; and I would give an arm, I\nthink, could it replevin all the idiotic and exquisite misery I knew\nthat night.\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\n_He Duels with a Stupid Woman_\n\n\nYet I approached the garden on Saturday night with an elated heart.\nThis was the last evening of the engagement of the Imperial Dramatic\nCompany. To-morrow the troupe was to leave Fairhaven; but I was very\nconfident that the leading lady would not accompany them, and by\nreason of this confidence, I smiled as I strode through the city of\nFairhaven, and hummed under my breath an inane ditty of an extremely\nsentimental nature.\n\nAs I bent over the little wooden gate, and searched for its elusive\nlatch, a man came out of the garden, wheeling sharply about the hedge\nthat, until this, had hidden him; and simultaneously, I was aware of\nthe mingled odour of bad tobacco and of worse whiskey. Well, she would\nhave done with such people soon! I threw open the gate, and stood\naside to let him pass; then, as the moon fell full upon the face of\nthe man, I gave an inarticulate, startled sound.\n\n\"Fine evening, sir,\" suggested the stranger.\n\n\"Eh?\" said I; \"eh? Oh, yes, yes! quite so!\" Afterward I shrugged my\nshoulders, and went into the garden, a trifle puzzled.\n\n\n 2\n\nI found her beneath a great maple in the heart of the enclosure. It\nwas a place of peace; the night was warm and windless, and the moon,\nnow come to its full glory, rode lazily in the west through a froth of\nclouds. Everywhere the heavens were faintly powdered with stardust,\nbut even the planets seemed pale and ineffectual beside the splendour\nof the moon.\n\nThe garden was drenched in moonshine--moonshine that silvered the\nunmown grass-plots, and converted the white rose-bushes into squat-figured\nwraiths, and tinged the red ones with dim purple hues. On every side the\nfoliage blurred into ambiguous vistas, where fireflies loitered; and the\nlong shadows of the nearer trees, straining across the grass, were wried\npatterns scissored out of blue velvet. It was a place of peace and light\nand languid odours, and I came into it, laughing, the possessor of an\nover-industrious heart and of a perfectly unreasoning joy over the fact\nthat I was alive.\n\n\"I say,\" I observed, as I stretched luxuriously upon the grass beside\nher, \"you put up at a shockingly disreputable place, Signorina.\"\n\"Yes?\" said she.\n\n\"That fellow who just went out,\" I explained--\"do you know the police\nwant his address, I think? No,\" I continued, after consideration, \"I\nam sure I'm not mistaken,--that is either Ned Lethbury, the embezzler,\nor his twin-brother. It's been five years since I saw him, but that is\nhe. And that\", said I, with proper severity, \"is a sample of the sort\nof associate you prefer to your humble servant! Ah, Signorina,\nSignorina, I am a tolerably worthless chap, I admit, but at least I\nnever forged and embezzled and then skipped my bail! So you had much\nbetter marry me, my dear, and say good-bye to your peculating friends.\nBut, deuce take it! I forgot--I ought to notify the police or\nsomething, I suppose.\"\n\nShe caught my arm. Her mouth opened and shut again before she spoke.\n\"He--he is my husband,\" she said, in a toneless voice. Then, on a\nsudden, she wailed: \"Oh, forgive me! Oh, my great, strong, beautiful\nboy, forgive me, for I am very unhappy, and I cannot meet your eyes--\nyour honest eyes! Ah, my dear, my dear, do not look at me like that,--\nyou don't know how it hurts!\"\n\nThe garden noises lisped about us in the long silence that fell. Then\nthe far-off whistling of some home going citizen of Fairhaven tinkled\nshrilly through the night, and I shuddered a bit.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I commenced, strangely quiet. \"You told me--\"\n\n\"Ah, I lied to you! I lied to you!\" she cried. \"I didn't, mean to--\nhurt you. I did not know--I couldn't know--I was so lonely, Bobbie,\"\nshe pleaded, with wide eyes; \"oh, you don't know how lonely I am. And\nwhen you came to me that first night, you--why, you spoke to me as the\nmen I once knew used to speak. There was respect in your voice, and I\nwanted that so; I hadn't had a man speak to me like that for years,\nyou know, Bobbie. And, boy dear, I was so lonely in my squalid\nworld,--and it seemed as if the world I used to know was calling me--\nyour world, Bobbie--the world I am shut out from.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said; \"I think I understand.\"\n\n\"And I thought for a week--just to peep into it, to be a lady again\nfor an hour or two--why, it didn't seem wicked, then, and I wanted it\nso much! I--I knew I could trust you, because you were only a boy. And\nI was hungry--_so_ hungry for a little respect, a little courtesy,\nsuch as men don't accord strolling actresses. So I didn't tell you\ntill the very last I was married. I lied to you. Oh, but you don't\nunderstand, this stupid, honest boy doesn't understand anything except\nthat I have lied to him!\"\n\n\"Signorina,\" I said, again, and I smiled, resolutely, \"I think I\nunderstand.\" I took both her hands in mine, and laughed a little.\n\"But, oh, my dear, my dear,\" I said, \"you should have told me that you\nloved another man; for you have let me love you for a week, and now I\nthink that I must love you till I die.\"\n\n\"Love him!\" she echoed. \"Oh, boy dear, boy dear, what a Galahad it is!\nI don't think Ned ever cared for anything but Father's money; and I--\nwhy, you have seen him. How _could_ I love him?\" she asked, as simply\nas a child.\n\nI bowed my head. \"And yet--\" said I. Then I laughed again, somewhat\nbitterly. \"Don't let's tell stories, Mrs. Lethbury,\" I said; \"it is\nkindly meant, I know, but I remember you now. I even danced with you\nonce, some seven years ago,--yes, at the Green Chalybeate. I remember\nthe night, for a variety of reasons. You are Alfred Van Orden's\ndaughter; your father is a wealthy man, a very wealthy man; and yet,\nwhen your--your husband disappeared you followed him--to become a\nstrolling actress. Ah, no, a woman doesn't sacrifice everything for a\nman in the way you have done, unless she loves him.\"\n\nI caught my breath. Some unknown force kept tugging down the corners\nof my mouth, in a manner that hampered speech; moreover, nothing\nseemed worth talking about. I had lost her. That was the one thing\nwhich mattered.\n\n\"Why, of course, I went with him,\" she assented, a shade surprised;\n\"he was my husband, you know. But as for loving,--no, I don't think\nNed ever really loved me,\" she reflected, with puckering brows. \"He\ntook that money for--for another woman, if you remember. But he is\nfond of me, and--and he _needs_ me.\"\n\nI did not say anything; and after a little she went on, with a quick\nlift of speech.\n\n\"Oh, what a queer life we have led since then! You can't imagine it,\nmy dear. He has been a tavern-keeper, a drummer,--everything! Why,\nlast summer we sold rugs and Turkish things in Atlantic City! But he\nis always afraid of meeting someone who knows him, and--and he drinks\ntoo much. So we have not got on in the world, Ned and I; and now,\nafter three years, I'm the leading lady of the Imperial Dramatic\nCompany, and he is the manager. I forgot, though,--he is advance-agent\nthis week, for he didn't dare stay in Fairhaven, lest some of the men\nat Mr. Charteris's should recognize him, you know. He came back only\nthis evening--\"\n\nShe paused for a moment; a wistful quaver crept into her speech. \"Oh,\nit's queer, it's queer, Bobbie! Sometimes--sometimes when I have time\nto think, say on long Sunday afternoons, I remember my old life, every\nbit of it,--oh, I do remember such strange little details! I remember\nthe designs on the bread and butter plates, and all the silver things\non my desk, and the plank by my door that always creaked and somehow\nnever got fixed, and the big, shiny buttons on the coachman's coat,--\njust trifles like that. And--and they hurt, they hurt, Bobbie, those\nlittle, unimportant things! They--grip my throat.\"\n\nShe laughed, not very mirthfully. \"Then I am like the old lady in the\nnursery rhyme, and say, Surely, this can't be I. But it is I, boy\ndear,--a strolling actress, a barn-stormer! Isn't it queer, Bobbie?\nBut, oh, you don't know half--\"\n\nI was remembering many things. I remembered Lethbury, a gross man,\nsuperfluously genial, whom I had never liked, although I recalled my\nadmiration of his whiskers. I recollected young Amelia Van Orden, not\ncome to her full beauty then, the bud of girlhood scarce slipped; and\nI remembered very vividly the final crash, the nine days' talk over\nLethbury's flight in the face of certain conviction,--by his father-in-\nlaw's advice (as some said) who had furnished and forfeited heavy bail\nfor the absconder. Oh, the brave woman who had followed! Oh, the brave,\nfoolish woman! And, for the action's recompense, he was content to\nexhibit her to yokels, to make of her beauty an article of traffic.\nHeine was right; there is an Aristophanes in heaven. And then hope\nblazed.\n\n\"Your husband,\" I said, quickly, \"he does not love you? He--he is not\nfaithful to you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered; \"there is a Miss Fortescue--she plays second\nparts--\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear, my dear!\" I cried, with a shaking voice; \"come away,\nSignorina,--come away with me! He _doesn't_ need you,--and, oh, my\ndear, I need you so! You can get your divorce and marry me. Ah,\nSignorina, come away,--come away from this squalid life that is\nkilling you, to the world you are meant for, to the life you hunger\nfor! Come back to the clean, lighthearted world you love, the world\nthat is waiting to pet and caress you just as it used to do,--our\nworld, Signorina! You don't belong here with--with the Fortescues. You\nbelong to us.\"\n\nI sprang to my feet. \"Come now!\" said I. \"There's Anne Charteris; she\nis a good woman, if ever lived one. She used to know you, too, didn't\nshe? Well, then, come with me to her, dearest--and tonight! You shall\nsee your father tomorrow. Your father--why, think how that old man\nloves you, how he has longed for you, his only daughter, all these\nyears. And I?\" I spread out my hands, in the tiniest, impotent\ngesture. \"I love you,\" I said, simply. \"I cannot do without you,\nheart's dearest.\"\n\nImpulsively, she rested both hands upon my breast; then bowed her head\na little. The nearness of her seemed to shake in my blood, to catch at\nmy throat, and my hands, lifted for a moment, trembled with desire of\nher.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" she said. \"I am a Catholic--my mother was one,\nyou know. There is no divorce for us. And--and besides, I'm not\nmodern. I am very old-fashioned, I suppose, in my ideas. Do you know,\"\nshe asked, with a smile upon the face which lifted confidingly toward\nme, \"I--I _really_ believe the world was made in six days; and that\nthe whale swallowed Jonah, and that there is a real purgatory and a\nhell of fire and brimstone. You don't, do you, Bobbie? But I do,--and\nI promised to stay with him till death parted us, you know, and I must\ndo it. I am all he has. He would get even worse without me. I--oh, boy\ndear, boy dear, I love you so!\" And her voice broke, in a great,\nchoking sob.\n\n\"A promise--a promise made by an ungrown girl to a brute--a thief--!\"\n\n\"No, dear,\" she answered, quietly; \"a promise made to God.\"\n\nAnd looking into her face, I saw love there, and anguish, and\ndetermination. It seemed monstrous, but of a sudden I knew with a dull\nsurety; she loved me, but she thought she had no right to love me; she\nwould not go with me. She would go with that drunken, brutish thief.\n\nAnd I suddenly recalled certain clever women--Alicia Wade, Pauline\nAshmeade, Cynthia Chaytor--the women of that world wherein I was\nnovitiate; beyond question, they would raise delicately penciled\neyebrows to proclaim this woman a fool--and to wonder.\n\nThey would be right, I thought. She was only a splendid, tender-hearted,\nbright-eyed fool, the woman that I loved. My heart sickened as her\nfolly rose between us, an impassable barrier. I hated it; and I revered\nit.\n\nThus we two stood silent for a time. The wind murmured above in the\nmaples, lazily, ominously. Then the gate clicked, with a vicious snap\nthat pierced the silence like the report of a distant rifle. \"That is\nprobably Ned,\" she said wearily. \"I had forgotten they close the\nbarrooms earlier on Saturday nights. So good-bye, Bobbie. You--you may\nkiss me, if you like.\"\n\nSo for a moment our lips met. Afterward I caught her hands in mine,\nand gripped them close to my breast, looking down into her eyes. They\nglinted in the moonlight, deep pools of sorrow, and tender--oh,\nunutterably tender and compassionate.\n\nBut I found no hope there. I lifted her hand to my lips, and left her\nalone in the garden.\n\n\n 3\n\nLethbury was fumbling at the gate.\n\n\"Such nuishance,\" he complained, \"havin' gate won't unlock. Latch mus'\ngot los'--po' li'l latch,\" murmured Mr. Lethbury, plaintively--\"all\n'lone in cruel worl'!\"\n\nI opened the gate for him, and stood aside to let him pass toward his\nwife.\n\n\n\n\n9.\n\n_He Puts His Tongue in His Cheek_\n\n\nIt was not long before John Charteris knew of the entire affair, for\nin those days I had few concealments from him: and the little wizened\nman brooded awhile over my misery, with an odd wistfulness.\n\n\"I remember Amelia Van Orden perfectly,\" he said--\"now. I ought to\nhave recognized her. Only, she was never, in her best days, the\nparagon you depict. She sang, I recollect; people made quite a to-do\nover her voice. But she was very, very stupid, and used to make loud\nshrieking noises when she was amused, and was generally reputed to be\n'fast.' I never investigated. Even so, there was not any real doubt as\nto her affair, in any event, with Anton von Anspach, after that night\nthe sleigh broke down--\"\n\n\"Oh, spare me all those ancient Lichfield scandals! She is an angel,\nJohn, if there was ever one.\"\n\n\"In your eyes, doubtless! So your heart is broken. Yet do you not\nrealize that not a month ago you were heartbroken over Stella\nMusgrave? Child, I repeat, I envy you this perpetual unhappiness, for\nI have lost, as you will presently lose, the capacity of being quite\nmiserable.\"\n\n\"But, John, it seems as if there were nothing left to live for, now--\"\n\n\"At twenty-one! Well, certainly, at that age one loves to think of\nlife as being implacable. But you will soon discover that she is\nmerely inconsequential, and that none of her antics are of lasting\nimportance; and you will learn to smile a deal more often than you\nweep or laugh.\"\n\nThen we talked of other matters. It was presently settled that\nCharteris was to take me abroad with him that summer; and with the\nthorough approval of my mother.\n\n\"Mr. Charteris will be of incalculable benefit to you,\" she told me,\n\"in introducing you to the very best people, all of whom he knows, of\ncourse, and besides you are getting to look older than I, and it is\nunpleasant to have to be always explaining you are only my stepson,\nparticularly as your father never married anybody but me, though,\nheaven knows, I wish he had. Of course you will be just as wild as\nyour father and your Uncle George. I suppose that is to be expected,\nand I daresay it will break my heart, but all I ask of you is please\nto keep out of the newspapers, except of course the social items. And\nif you _must_ associate with abandoned women, please for my sake,\nRobert, don't have anything to do with those who can prove that they\nare only misunderstood, because they are the most dangerous kind.\"\n\nI kissed her. \"Dear little mother, I honestly believe that when you\nget to heaven you will refuse to speak to Mary Magdalen.\"\n\n\"Robert, let us remember the Bible says, 'in my Father's house are\nmany mansions,' and of course nobody would think of putting me in the\nsame mansion with her.\"\n\nIt was well-nigh the last conversation I was to hold with my mother;\nand I was to remember it with an odd tenderness....\n\n\n 2\n\nUpon the doings of myself in Europe during the ensuing two years I\nprefer to dwell as lightly as possible. I had long anticipated a\nsojourn in divers old-world cities; but the London I had looked to\nfind was the London of Dickens, say, and my Paris the Paris of Dumas,\nor at the very least of Balzac. It is needless to mention that in the\ncircles to which the, quite real, friendship of John Charteris\nafforded an entry I found little that smacked of such antiquity. I had\nentered a world inhabited by people who amused themselves and\napparently did nothing else; and I was at first troubled by their\nlevity, and afterward envious of it, and in the end embarked upon\nsedulous attempt to imitate it. I continued to be very boyish; indeed,\nI found myself by this in much the position of an actor who has made\nsuch a success in one particular role that the public declines to\npatronize him in any other.\n\n\n 3\n\nIt was during this first year abroad that I wrote _The Apostates_,\nlargely through the urging of John Charteris.\n\n\"You have the ability, though, that dances most gracefully in fetters.\nYou will never write convincingly about the life you know, because\nlife is, to you, my adorable boy, a series of continuous miracles, to\nwhich the eyes of other men are case-hardened. Write me, then, a book\nabout the past.\"\n\n\"I have thought of it,\" said I, \"for being over here makes the past\nseem pretty real, somehow. Last month when I was at Ingilby I was on\nfire with the notion of writing something about old Ormskirk--my\nmother's ancestor, you know. And since I've seen what's left of\nBellegarde I have wanted to write about his wife's people too,--the\ndukes and vicomtes of Puysange, or even about the great Jurgen. You\nsee, I am just beginning to comprehend that these are not merely\ncharacters in Lowe's and La Vrilliere's books, but my flesh and blood\nkin, like Uncle George Bulmer--\"\n\n\"And for that reason you want to write about them! You would, though;\nit is eminently characteristic. Well, then, why should you not\nimmortalize the persons who had the honor of begetting you--oh, most\nhandsome and most naive of children!--by writing your very best about\nthem?\" \"Because to succeed--not only among the general but with the\n'cultured few,' God save the mark!--it is now necessary to write not\nbadly but abominably.\"\n\n\"What would you demand, then, of a book?\"\n\nI meditated. \"What one most desiderates in the writings of to-day is\nclarity, and beauty, and tenderness and urbanity, and truth.\"\n\n\"Not a bad recipe, upon the whole, though I would stipulate for\nsymmetry and distinction also--Write the book!\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said I, \"but this is the kind of book I wish to read when, of\ncourse, the mood seizes me. It is not at all the sort of book, though,\nI would elect to write. The main purpose of writing any book, I take\nit, is to be read; and people simply will not read a book when they\nsuspect it of being carefully written. That sort of thing gets on a\nreader's nerves; it's too much like watching a man walk a tight-rope\nand wondering if he won't slip presently.\"\n\n\"Oh, 'people!'\" Charteris flung out, in an extremity of scorn. \"Since\ntime was young, a generally incompetent humanity has been willing to\npardon anything rather than the maddening spectacle of labour\ncompetently done. And they are perfectly right; it is abominable how\nsuch weak-minded persons occasionally thrust themselves into a world\nquite obviously designed for persons who have not any minds at all.\nBut I was not asking you to write a 'best-seller.'\"\n\n\"No, you were asking me to become an Economist, and be one of 'the few\nrare spirits which every age providentially affords,' and so on. That\nis absolute and immoral nonsense. When you publish a novel you are at\nleast pretending to supply a certain demand; and if you don't\nendeavour honestly to supply it, you are a swindler, no more and no\nless. No, it is all very well to write for posterity, if it amuses\nyou, John; personally, I cannot imagine what possible benefit you will\nderive from it, even though posterity _does_ read your books. And for\nmyself, I want to be read and to be a power while I can appreciate the\nfact that I _am_ a sort of power, however insignificant. Besides, I\nwant to make some money out of the blamed thing. Mother is a dear, of\ncourse, but, like all the Bulmers, with age she is becoming tight-fisted.\"\n\n\"And Esau--\" Charteris began.\n\n\"Yes,--but that's Biblical, and publishing a book is business. People\nsay to authors, just as they do to tailors: 'I want such and such an\narticle. Make it and I'll pay you for it.' Now, your tailor may\nconsider the Imperial Roman costume more artistic than that of today,\nand so may you in the abstract, but if he sent home a toga in place of\na pair of trousers, you would discontinue dealing with him. So if it\namuses you to make togas, well and good; I don't quarrel with it; but,\npersonally, I mean to go into the gents' furnishing line and to do my\nwork efficiently.\"\n\n\"Yes,--but with your tongue in your cheek.\"\n\n\"It is the one and only attitude,\" I sweetly answered, \"in which to\nwrite if you indeed desire to be read with enjoyment.\" And presently I\nrose and launched upon\n\n_A Defence of That Attitude_\n\n\"The main trouble with you, John Charteris, is that you will never\nrecover from being _fin de siecle_. Yes, you belong to that queer\ndying nineteenth century. And even so, you have quite overlooked what\nis, perhaps, the signal achievement of the nineteenth century,--the\nrelegation of its literature to the pharmacopoeia. The comparison of\nthe tailor, I willingly admit, is a bad one. Those who write\nsuccessfully nowadays must appeal to men and women who seek in fiction\nnot only a means of relaxation, but spiritual comfort as well, and an\nuplifting rather than a mere diversion of the mind; so that they are\nreally druggists who trade exclusively in intoxicants and hypnotics.\n\n\"Half of the customers patronize the reading-matter shops because they\nwant to induce delusions about a world they know, and do not find\nparticularly roseate and the other half skim through a book because\nthey haven't anything else to do and aren't sleepy, as yet.\n\n\"Oh, in filling either prescription the trick is much the same; you\nhave simply to avoid bothering the reader's intellect in any way\nwhatever. You have merely to drug it, you have merely to caress it\nwith interminable platitudes, or else with the most uplifting\navoidances of anything which happens to be unprintably rational. And\nyou must remember always that the crass emotions of half-educated\npersons are, in reality, your chosen keyboard; so play upon it with an\naxe if you haven't any handier implement, but hit it somehow, and for\nmonths your name will be almost as famous as that of my mother's\nfather remains the year round because he invented a celebrated\nbaking-powder.\n\n\"It is all very well for you to sneer, and talk about art. But there\nare already in this world a deal more Standard Works than any man can\nhope to digest in the average lifetime. I don't quarrel with them,\nfor, personally, I find even Ruskin, like the python in the circus,\nentirely endurable so long as there is a pane of glass between us. But\nwhy, in heaven's name, should you endeavour to harass humanity with\none more battalion of morocco-bound reproaches for sins of omission,\nwhenever humanity goes into the library to take a nap? For what other\npurpose do you suppose a gentleman goes into his library, pray? When\nhe is driven to reading he does it decently in bed.\n\n\"Besides, if I like a book, why, then, in so far as I am concerned, it\n_is_ a good book. No, please don't talk to me about 'the dignity of\nliterature'; modern fiction has precisely as much to do with dignity\nas has vaudeville or billiards or that ridiculous Prohibitionist\nParty, since the object of all four, I take it, is to afford diversion\nto people who haven't anything better to do. Thus, a novel which has\ndiverted a thousand semi-illiterate persons is exactly ten times as\ngood as a novel that has pleased a hundred superior persons. It is\nsimply a matter of arithmetic.\n\n\"You prefer to look upon writing as an art, rather than a business?\nOh, you silly little man, the touchstone of any artist is the skill\nwith which he adapts his craftsmanship to his art's limitations. He\nwill not attempt to paint a sound or to sculpture a colour, because he\nknows that painting and sculpture have their limitations, and he,\nquite consciously, recognizes this fact whenever he sets to work.\n\n\"Well, the most important limitation of writing fiction nowadays is\nthat you have to appeal to people who would never think of reading you\nor anybody else, if they could possibly imagine any other employment\nfor that particular vacant half-hour. And you cannot hope for an\naudience of even moderately intelligent persons, because intelligent\npersons do not attempt to keep abreast with modern fiction. It is\nprobably ascribable to the fact that they enjoy being intelligent, and\nwish to remain so.\n\n\"You sneer at the 'best-sellers.' I tell you, in sober earnest, that\nthe writing of a frankly trashy novel which will 'sell,' is the\nhighest imaginable form of art. For true art, in its last terms, is\nthe adroit circumvention of an unsurmountable obstacle. I suppose that\nform and harmony and colour are very difficult to tame; and the\nsculptor, the musician and the painter quite probably earn their hire.\nBut people don't go to concerts unless they want to hear music;\nwhereas the people who buy the 'best-sellers' are the people who would\nprefer to do _anything_ rather than be reduced to reading. I protest\nthat the man who makes these people read on until they see how 'it all\ncame out' is a deal more than an artist; he is a sorcerer.\"\n\nAnd I paused, a little out of breath.\n\n\"What a boy it is!\" said Charteris. \"Do you know, you are uncommonly\nhandsome when you are talking nonsense? Write the trashy book, then. I\nnever argue with children; and besides, I do not have to read it.\"\n\n\n 4\n\nIt thus fell about that in the second European year, not very long\nafter my mother's death, _The Apostates_ was given to the world, with\nwhat result the world has had a plenty of time wherein to forget....\nIt was first published in _The Quaker Post_, with pictures by Roderick\nKing Hill, and in the autumn was brought out as a book by Stuyvesant\nand Brothers. I made rather a good thing cut of it financially; but\nthe numerous letters I received from the people who had liked it I\nfound extremely objectionable. They were not the right sort of people,\nI felt forlornly.... So I endured my plaudits without undue elation,\nfor I always held _The Apostates_ to be, at best, a medley of\nconventional tricks and extravagant rhetoric, inanimate by any least\nparticle of myself,--and its success, say, as though the splendiferous\ntrappings of an emperor were hung upon a clothier's dummy, and the\nresult accepted as an adequate presentation of Charlemagne.\n\nIn other words, the book was the most unbridled kind of balderdash,\nfounded on my callow recollections of the Green Chalybeate,--not the\nleast bit accurate, as I was afterward to discover,--with all the good\npeople exceedingly oratorical and the bad ones singularly epigrammatic\nand abandoned and obtuse. I introduced a depraved nobleman, of course,\nto give the requisite touch of high society, seasoned the mixture with\nFrench and botany and with a trifle of Dolly Dialoguishness, and\ninserted, at judicious intervals, the most poetical of descriptions,\nso that the skipping of them might afford an agreeable rest to the\nreader's eye. There was also a sufficiency of piddling with unsavoury\nmatters to insure the suffrage of schoolgirls.\n\nAnd a number of persons, in fine, were so misguided as to enthuse over\nthe result. The verb is carefully selected, for they one and all were\njust the sort of people who \"enthuse.\"\n\n\n 5\n\nI was vexed, however, at the time to find I could not achieve an\nappropriate emotion over my mother's death. The news came, to be sure,\nat a season when I was preoccupied with getting rid of Agnes Faroy....\nI have not ever heard of any rational excuse for the quite common\nassumption that children ought to be particularly fond of their\nparents. Still, my mother was the prettiest woman I had ever known,\nthough without any claim to beauty, and I had always gloried in our\nkinship; for I believed her nature to be generous and amiable when she\nthought of it; and the cablegram which announced the event aroused in\nme sincere regret that a comely ornament to my progress had been\nsmashed irrevocably.\n\nFor a little I reflected as to whither she had vanished, and decided\nshe had been too futile and well-meaning ever to be punished by any\nreasonable Being. Yet how she would have enjoyed the publication of my\nbook!--without any attempt to read it, however, since she had never,\nto my knowledge, read anything, with the exception of the daily\npapers.... And besides, I disliked being unable to have the\nappropriate emotion.\n\nBut I simply could not manage it. For here, in the midst of the Faroy\nmess,--with Agnes weeping all over the place, and her brothers\nflourishing pistols and declaiming idiocies,--came the news from Uncle\nGeorge that my mother had left me virtually nothing. She must have\nused up, of course, a good share of her Bulmer Baking Powder money in\nsupporting my father comfortably; but she had always lived in such\nestate as to make me assume she had retained, anyhow, enough of the\nBulmer money to last my time. So it was naturally a shock to discover\nthat this monetary attitude was inherited from my mother, who had been\ncheerfully \"living on her principle\" all these years, without\nconsidering my future. I had no choice but to regard it as abominably\nselfish.\n\n\"I think Claire was afraid to tell you,\" wrote Uncle George, \"how\nlittle there was left. In any event, she always shirked doing it, so\nas to stave off unpleasantness. And when we cabled you how ill she\nwas, it now seems most unfortunate you could not see your way clear to\ngiving up your trip through the chateau country, as your not coming\nappeared to be on her mind a great deal at the last. I do not wish to\nseem to criticize you in any way, Robert, but I must say....\"\n\nWell, but you know what sort of nonsense that smug gambit heralds in\nletters from your kindred. Even so, I now owned the Townsend house and\nan income sufficient for daily bread; and it looked just then as\nthough the magazine editors were willing to furnish the butter, and\noccasional cakes. So the future promised to be pleasant enough.\n\n\n 6\n\nCharteris had returned to Algiers in the autumn my book was published,\nbut I elected to pass the winter in England. \"Of course,\" was Mr.\nCharteris's annotation--\"because it is precisely the most dangerous\nspot in the world for you. And you are to spend October at Negley? I\nwarn you that Jasper Hardress is in love with his wife, and that the\nwoman has an incurable habit of making experiments and an utter\ninability to acquire experience. Take my advice, and follow Mrs.\nMonteagle to the Riviera, instead. Cissie will strip you of every\npenny you have, of course, but in the end you will find her a deal\nless expensive than Gillian Hardress.\"\n\n\"You possess a low and evil mind,\" I observed, \"since I am fond, in\nall sincerity, of Hardress, whereas his wife is not even civil to me.\nWhy, she goes out of her way to be rude to me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Charteris; \"but that is because she is getting worried\nabout her interest in you. And what is the meaning of this, by the\nway? I found it on your table this morning.\" He read the doggerel\naloud with an unkindly and uncalled-for exaggeration of the rhyming\nwords.\n\n  \"We did not share the same inheritance,--\n  I and this woman, five years older than I,\n  Yet daughter of a later century,--\n  Who is therefore only wearied by that dance\n  Which has set my blood a-leaping.\n\n                              \"It is queer\n  To note how kind her face grows, listening\n  To my wild talk, and plainly pitying\n  My callow youth, and seeing in me a dear\n  Amusing boy,--yet somewhat old to be\n  Still reading _Alice Through the Looking-Glass_\n  And _Water-Babies_.... With light talk we pass,\n\n  \"And I that have lived long in Arcady--\n  I that have kept so many a foolish tryst,\n  And written drivelling rhymes--feel stirring in me\n  Droll pity for this woman who pities me,\n  And whose weak mouth so many men have kissed.\"\n\n\"That,\" I airily said, \"is, in the first place, something you had no\nbusiness to read; and, in the second, simply the blocking out of an\nentrancingly beautiful poem. It represents a mood.\"\n\n\"It is the sort of mood that is not good for people, particularly for\nchildren. It very often gets them shot too full of large and untidy\nholes.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said I, but not in displeasure, because it made me feel\nlike such a devil of a fellow. So I finished my letter to Bettie\nHamlyn,--for this was on the seventh,--and I went to Negley precisely\nas I had planned.\n\n\n 7\n\n\"We were just speaking of you,\" Mrs. Hardress told me, the afternoon\nof my arrival,--\"Blanche and I were talking of you, Mr. Townsend, the\nvery moment we heard your wheels.\"\n\nI shook hands. \"I trust you had not entirely stripped me of my\nreputation?\"\n\n\"Surely, that is the very last of your possessions any reasonable\nperson would covet?\"\n\n\"A palpable hit,\" said I. \"Nevertheless, you know that all I possess\nin the world is yours for the asking.\"\n\n\"Yes, you mentioned as much, I think, at Nice. Or was it Colonel\nTatkin who offered me a heart's devotion and an elopement? No, I\nbelieve it was you. But, dear me, Jasper is so disgustingly healthy\nthat I shall probably never have any chance of recreation.\"\n\nI glanced toward Jasper Hardress. \"I have heard,\" said I, hopefully,\n\"that there is consumption in the family?\"\n\n\"Heavens, no! he told me that before marriage to encourage me, but I\nfind there is not a word of truth in it.\"\n\nThen Jasper Hardress came to welcome his guest, and save from a\ndistance I saw no more that evening of Gillian Hardress.\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\n_He Samples New Emotions_\n\n\nIt was the following day, about noon, as I sat intent upon my Paris\n_Herald_ that a tiny finger thrust a hole in it. I gave an inaudible\nobservation, and observed a very plump young person in white with\ndisfavour.\n\n\"And who may you happen to be?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I'm Gladys,\" the young lady responded; \"and I've runned away.\"\n\n\"But not without an escort, I trust, Miss Gladys? Really--upon my\nword, you know, you surprise me, Gladys! An elopement without even a\ntincture of masculinity is positively not respectable.\" I took the\nlittle girl into my lap, for I loved children, and all helpless\nthings. \"Gladys,\" I said, \"why don't you elope with me? And we will\nspend our honeymoon in the Hesperides.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Gladys, cheerfully. She leaned upon my chest, and\nthe plump, tiny hand clasped mine, in entire confidence; and the\ncontact moved me to an irrational transport and to a yearning whose\naim I could not comprehend. \"Now tell me a story,\" said Gladys.\n\nSo that I presently narrated to Gladys the ensuing\n\n  _Story of the Flowery Kingdom_\n\n  \"Fair Sou-Chong-Tee, by a shimmering brook\n  Where ghost-like lilies loomed tall and straight,\n  Met young Too-Hi, in a moonlit nook,\n  Where they cooed and kissed till the hour was late:\n  Then, with lanterns, a mandarin passed in state,\n  Named Hoo-Hung-Hoo of the Golden Band,\n  Who had wooed the maiden to be his mate--\n  For these things occur in the Flowery Land.\n\n  \"Now, Hoo-Hung-Hoo had written a book,\n  In seven volumes, to celebrate\n  The death of the Emperor's thirteenth cook:\n  So, being a person whose power was great,\n  He ordered a herald to indicate\n  He would blind Too-Hi with a red-hot brand\n  And marry Sou-Chong at a quarter-past-eight,--\n  For these things occur in the Flowery Land.\n\n  \"And the brand was hot, and the lovers shook\n  In their several shoes, when by lucky fate\n  A Dragon came, with his tail in a crook,--\n  A Dragon out of a Nankeen Plate,--\n  And gobbled the hard-hearted potentate\n  And all of his servants, and snorted, _and_\n  Passed on at a super-cyclonic rate,--\n  For these things occur in the Flowery Land.\n\n  \"The lovers were wed at an early date,\n  And lived for the future, I understand,\n  In one continuous tete-a-tete,--\n  For these things occur...in the Flowery Land.\"\n\n\nGladys wanted to know: \"But what sort of house is a tete-a-tete? Is it\nlike a palace?\"\n\n\"It is very often much nicer than a palace,\" I declared,--\"provided of\ncourse you are only stopping over for a week-end.\"\n\n\"And wasn't it odd the Dragon should have come just when he did?\"\n\n\"Oh, Gladys, Gladys! don't tell me you are a realist.\"\n\n\"No, I'm a precious angel,\" she composedly responded, with a flavour\nof quotation.\n\n\"Well! it is precisely the intervention of the Dragon, Gladys, which\nproves the story is literature,\" I announced. \"Don't you pity the poor\nDragon, Gladys, who never gets a chance in life and has to live always\nbetween two book-covers?\"\n\nShe said that couldn't be so, because it would squash him.\n\n\"And yet, dear, it is perfectly true,\" said Mrs. Hardress. The lean\nand handsome woman was regarding the pair of us curiously. \"I didn't\nknow you cared for children, Mr. Townsend. Yes, she is my daughter.\"\nShe carried Gladys away, without much further speech.\n\nYet one Parthian comment in leaving me was flung over her shoulder,\nsnappishly. \"I wish you wouldn't imitate John Charteris so. You are\ngetting to be just a silly copy of him. You are just Jack where he is\nJohn. I think I shall call you Jack.\"\n\n\"I wish you would,\" I said, \"if only because your sponsors happened to\nchristen you Gillian. So it's a bargain. And now when are we going for\nthat pail of water?\"\n\nMrs. Hardress wheeled, the child in her arms, so that she was looking\nat me, rather queerly, over the little round, yellow head. \"And it was\nonly Jill, as I remember, who got the spanking,\" she said. \"Oh, well!\nit always is just Jill who gets the spanking--Jack.\"\n\n\"But it was Jack who broke his crown,\" said I; \"Wasn't it--Jill?\" It\nseemed a jest at the time. But before long we had made these nicknames\na habit, when just we two were together. And the outcome of it all was\nnot precisely a jest....\n\n\n 2\n\nShe told me not long after this, \"When I saw Gladys loved you, of\ncourse I loved you too.\" And I hereby soberly record the statement\nthat to have a woman fall thoroughly in love with him is the most\nuncomfortable experience which can ever befall any man.\n\nI am tolerably sure I never made any amorous declaration. Rather, it\nsimply bewildered me to observe the shameless and irrational\ninfatuation this woman presently bore for me, and before it I was\npowerless. When I told her frankly I did not love her, had never loved\nher, had no intention of ever loving her, she merely bleated, \"You are\ncruel!\" and wept. When I attempted to restrain her paroxysms of\nanguish, she took it as a retraction of what I had told her.\n\nI would then have given anything in the world to be rid of Gillian\nHardress. This led to scenes, and many scenes, and played the very\ndevil with the progress of my second novel. You cannot write when\nanyone insists on sitting in the same room with you, on the irrelevant\nplea that she is being perfectly quiet, and therefore is not\ndisturbing you. Besides, she had no business in my room, and was apt\nto get caught there.\n\n\n 3\n\nI remember one of these contentions. She is abominably rouged, and\nbefore me she is grovelling, as she must have seen some actress do\nupon the stage.\n\n\"Oh, I lied to you,\" she wailed; \"but you are so cruel! Ah, don't be\ncruel, Jack!\"\n\nThen I lifted the scented woman to her feet, and she stayed\nmotionless, regarding me. She had really wonderful eyes.\n\n\"You are evil,\" I said, \"through and through you are evil, I think,\nand I can't help thinking you are a little crazy. But I wish you would\nteach me to be as you are, for tonight the hands of my dead father\nstrain from his grave and clutch about my ankles. He has the right\nbecause it is his flesh I occupy. And I must occupy the body of a\nTownsend always. It is not quite the residence I would have chosen--\nEh, well, for all that, I am I! And at bottom I loathe you!\"\n\n\"You love me!\" she breathed.\n\nI thrust her aside and paced the floor. \"This is an affair of moment.\nI may not condescend to sell, as Faustus did, but of my own volition\nmust I will to squander or preserve that which is really Robert\nTownsend.\"\n\nI wheeled upon Gillian Hardress, and spoke henceforward with\ndeliberation. You must remember I was very young as yet.\n\n\"I have often regretted that the colour element of vice is so oddly\nlacking in our life of to-day. We appear, one and all, to have been\nborn at an advanced age and with ladylike manners, and we reach our\nyears of indiscretion very slowly; and meanwhile we learn, too late,\nthat prolonged adherence to morality trivialises the mind as\nhopelessly as a prolonged vice trivialises the countenance. I fear\nthis has been said by someone else, my too impetuous Jill, and I hope\nnot, for in that event I might possibly be speaking sensibly, and to\nbe sensible is a terrible thing and almost as bad as being\nintelligible.\"\n\n\"You are not being very intelligible now, sweetheart. But I love to\nhear you talk.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, I am young, and in youth--_il faut des emotions_, as\nBlanche Amory is reported to have said, by a novelist named Thackeray,\nwhose productions are now read in public libraries. Still, for a\nrespectable and brougham-supporting person, Thackeray came then as\nnear to speaking the truth as is possible for people of that class. In\nyouth emotions are necessary. Find me, therefore, a new emotion!\"\n\n\"So many of them, dear!\" she promised.\n\n\"I do not love you, understand,--and your husband is my friend, and I\nadmire him. But I am I! I have endowments, certain faculties which\nmany men are flattering enough to envy--and I will to make of them a\ncarpet for your quite unworthy feet. I will to degrade all that in me\nis most estimable, and in return I demand a new emotion.\"\n\n\n 4\n\nWell, but women are queer. There is positively no way of affronting\nthem, sometimes. She had not even the grace to note that I had taken a\nlittle too much to drink that night.... But over all this part of my\nlife I prefer to pass as quickly as may be expedient.\n\n\n 5\n\nI remembered, anyway, after Gillian had gone from my room, to write\nBettie Hamlyn a post-card. It was no longer, strictly speaking, the\ntwenty-third, but considerably after midnight, of course. Still, it\nwas the writing regularly when I loathed writing letters that counted\nwith Bettie, I reflected; and virtually I was writing on the twenty-third,\nand besides, Bettie would never know.\n\n\n 6\n\nAnd thereafter Gillian Hardress made almost no concealment of her\nfeeling toward me, or employed at best the flimsiest of disguises. All\nthat winter she wrote to me daily, and, when the same roof sheltered\nus, would slip the scribblings into my hand at odd moments, but\npreferably before her husband's eyes. She demanded an account of every\nminute I spent apart from her, and never believed a syllable of my\nexplanations; and in a sentence, she pestered me to the verge of\ndistraction.\n\nAnd always the circumstance which chiefly puzzled me was the host of\nmen that were infatuated by Gillian Hardress. There was no doubt about\nit; she made fools of the staidest, if for no better end than that the\nspectacle might amuse me.\n\n\"Now you watch me, Jack!\" she would say. And I obediently would watch\nher wriggling beguilements, and the man's smirking idiocy, with\nbewilderment.\n\nFor in me her allurements aroused, now, absolutely no sensation save\nthat of boredom. Often I used to wonder for what reason it seemed\nimpossible for me, alone, to adore this woman insanely. It would have\nbeen so much more pleasant, all around.\n\nBut, I repeat, I wish to have done with this portion of my life as\nquickly as may be expedient. I am not particularly proud of it. I\nwould elide it altogether, were it possible, but as you will presently\nsee, that is not possible if I am to make myself intelligible. And I\nfind that the more I write of myself the more I am affected by the\nsame poor itch for self-exposure which has made Pepys and Casanova and\nRousseau famous, and later feminine diarists notorious.\n\nWere I writing fiction, now, I would make the entire affair more\nplausible. As it stands, I am free to concede that this chapter in my\nlife history rings false throughout, just as any candid record of an\nactual occurrence does invariably. It is not at all probable that a\nwoman so much older than I should have taken possession of me in this\nfashion, almost against my will. It is even less probable that her\nhusband, who was by ordinary absurdly jealous of her, should have\nsuspected nothing and have been sincerely fond of me.\n\nBut then I was only twenty-two, as age went physically, and he looked\nupon me as an infant. I was, I think, quite conscientiously childish\nwith Jasper Hardress. I prattled with him, and he liked it. And so\noften, especially when we three were together--say, at luncheon,--I\nwas teased by an insane impulse to tell him everything, just casually,\nand see what he would do.\n\nI think it was the same feeling which so often prompted her to tell\nhim, in her flighty way, of how profoundly she adored me. I would\nwriggle and blush; and Jasper Hardress would laugh and protest that he\nadored me too. Or she would expatiate upon this or that personal\nfeature of mine, or the becomingness of a new cravat, say; and would\ndemand of her husband if Jack--for so she always called me,--wasn't\nthe most beautiful boy in the world? And he would laugh and answer\nthat he thought it very likely.\n\n\n 7\n\nThey were Americans, I should have said earlier, but to all intents\nthey lived abroad, and had done so for years. Hardress's father had\nbeen thoughtful enough to leave him a sufficient fortune to\ncountenance the indulgence of this or any other whim, so that the\nHardresses divided the year pretty equally between their real home at\nNegley and a tiny chateau which they owned near Aix-les-Bains. I\nvisited them at both places.\n\nIt was a pleasant fiction that I came to see Gladys. Regularly, I was\ntold off to play with her, as being the only other child in the house.\nIt was rather hideous, for the little girl adored me, and I was\nbeginning to entertain an odd aversion toward her, as being in a way\nresponsible for everything. Had Gillian Hardress never found me\ncuddling the child, whose sex was visibly a daily aggrievement to\nJasper Hardress, however conscientiously he strove to conceal the\nfact,--so that in consequence \"I have to love my precious lamb for\ntwo, Jack,\"--Gillian would never, I think, have distinguished me from\nthe many other men who, so lightly, tendered a host of gallant\nspeeches.... But I never fathomed Gillian Hardress, beyond learning\nvery early in our acquaintance that she rarely told me the truth about\nanything.\n\nAlso I should have said that Hardress cordially detested Charteris,\njust as Bettie Hamlyn did, because for some reason he suspected the\nlittle novelist of being in love with Hardress's wife. I do not know;\nbut I imagine Charteris had made advances to her, in his own ambiguous\nfashion, as he was apt to do, barring strenuous discouragement, to\nevery passably handsome woman he was left alone with. I do know he\nmade love to her a little later.\n\nHardress distrusted a number of other men, for precisely the same\nreason. Heaven only is familiar with what grounds he had. I merely\nknow that Gillian Hardress loathed John Charteris; she was jealous of\nhis influence over me. But me her husband never distrusted. I was only\nan amusing and ingenuous child of twenty-two, and not for a moment did\nit occur to him that I might be in love with his wife.\n\nIndeed, I believe upon reflection that he was in the right. I think I\nnever was.\n\n\n 8\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I am to meet the Charterises in Genoa. Yes, it is\nrather sudden. I am off to-morrow. I shall not see you dear good\npeople for some time, I fancy....\"\n\nWhen Hardress had gone the woman said in a stifled voice: \"No, I will\nnot dance. Take me somewhere--there is a winter-garden, I know--\"\n\n\"No, Jill,\" said I, with decision. \"It's no use. I am really going. We\nwill not argue it.\"\n\nGillian Hardress watched the dancers for a moment, as with languid\ninterest. \"You fear that I am going to make a scene. Well! I can't.\nYou have selected your torture chamber too carefully. Oh, after all\nthat's been between us, to tell me here, to my husband's face, in the\npresence of some three hundred people, without a moment's warning,\nthat you are 'off to-morrow!' It--it is for good, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"It had to be--some time, you know.\"\n\n\"No, don't look at me. Watch the dancing, I will fan myself and seem\nbored. No, I shall not do anything rash.\"\n\nI was uncomfortable. Yet at bottom it was the theatric value of this\nscene which impressed me,--the gaiety and the brilliance on every side\nof her misery. And I did not look at her. I did just as she ordered\nme.\n\n\"I was proud once. I haven't any pride now. You say you must leave me.\nOh, dearest boy, if you only knew how unhappy I will be without you,\nyou could not leave me. Sweetheart, you must know how I love you. I\nlong every minute to be with you, and to see you even at a distance is\na pleasure. I know it is not right for me to ask or expect you to love\nme always, but it seems so hard.\"\n\n\"It's no use, Jill--\"\n\n\"Is it another woman? I won't mind. I won't be jealous. I won't make\nscenes, for I know you hate scenes, and I have made so many. It was\nbecause I cared so much. I never cared before, Jack. You have tired of\nme, I know. I have seen it coming. Well, you shall have your way in\neverything. But don't leave me, dear! oh, my dear, my dear, don't\nleave me! Oh, I have given you everything, and I ask so little in\nreturn--just to see you sometimes, just to touch your hand sometimes,\nas the merest stranger might do....\"\n\nSo her voice went on and on while I did not look at her. There was no\npassion in this voice of any kind. It was just the long monotonous\nwail of some hurt animal.... They were playing the _Valse Bleu_, I\nremember. It lasted a great many centuries, and always that low voice\nwas pleading with me. Yes, it was uncommonly unpleasant; but always at\nthe back of my mind some being that was not I was taking notes as to\nprecisely how I felt, because some day they might be useful, for the\nbook I had already outlined. \"It is no use, Jill,\" I kept repeating,\ndoggedly.\n\nThen Armitage came smirking for his dance. Gillian Hardress rose, and\nher fan shut like a pistol-shot. She was all in black, and throughout\nthat moment she was more beautiful than any other woman I have ever\nseen.\n\n\"Yes, this is our dance,\" she said, brightly. \"I thought you had\nforgotten me, Mr. Armitage. Well! good-bye, Mr. Townsend. Our little\ntalk has been very interesting--hasn't it? Oh, this dress _always_\ngets in my way--\"\n\nShe was gone. I felt that I had managed affairs rather crudely, but it\nwas the least unpleasant way out, and I simply had not dared to trust\nmyself alone with her. So I made the best of an ill bargain, and\nremodeled the episode more artistically when I used it later, in\n_Afield_.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\n_He Postures Among Chimney-Pots_\n\n\nI met the Charterises in Genoa, just as I had planned. Anne's first\nexclamation was, \"Heavens, child, how dissipated you look! I would\nscarcely have known you.\"\n\nCharteris said nothing. But he and I lunched at the Isotta the\nfollowing day, and at the conclusion of the meal the little man leaned\nback and lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"You must overlook my wife's unfortunate tendency toward the most\nunamiable of virtues. But, after all, you are clamantly not quite the\nboy I left at Liverpool last October. Where are your Hardresses now?\"\n\n\"In London for the season. And why is your wife rushing on to Paris,\nJohn?\"\n\n\"Shopping, as usual. Yes, I believe I did suggest it was as well to\nhave it over and done with. Anne is very partial to truisms. Besides,\nshe has an aunt there, you know. Take my advice, and always marry a\nwoman who is abundantly furnished with attractive and visitable\nrelations, for this precaution is the true secret of every happy\nmarriage. We may, then, regard the Hardress incident as closed?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord, yes!\" said I, emphatically.\n\n\"Well, after all, you have been sponging off them for a full year. The\nadjective is not ill-chosen, from what I hear. I fancy Mrs. Hardress\nhas found you better company after she had mixed a few drinks for you,\nand so--But a truce to moral reflections! for I am desirous once more\nto hear the chimes at midnight. I hear Francine is in Milan?\"\n\n\"There is at any rate in Milan,\" said I, \"a magnificent Gothic\nCathedral of international reputation; and upon the upper gallery of\nits tower, as my guidebook informs me, there is a watchman with an\nefficient telescope. Should I fail to meet that watchman, John, I would\nfeel that I had lived futilely. For I want both to view with him the\nLombard plain, and to ask him his opinion of Cino da Pistoia, and as to\nwhat was in reality the middle name of Cain's wife.\"\n\n\n 2\n\nFrancine proved cordial; but John Charteris was ever fickle, and not\nlong afterward an Italian countess, classic in feature, but in coloring\nsmacking of an artistic renaissance, had drawn us both to Switzerland,\nand thence to Liege. It was great fun, knocking about the Continent\nwith John, for he knew exactly how to order a dinner, and spoke I don't\nknow how many languages, and seemed familiar with every side-street and\nback-alley in Europe. For myself, my French as acquired in Fairhaven\nappeared to be understood by everybody, but in replying very few of the\nnatives could speak their own foolish language comprehensibly. I could\nrarely make head or tail out of what they were jabbering about.\n\nI was alone that evening, because Annette's husband had turned up\nunexpectedly; and Charteris had gone again to hear Nadine Neroni, the\nnew prima donna, concerning whom he and his enameled Italian friend\nraved tediously. But I never greatly cared for music; besides, the\nopera that night was _Faust_; the last act of which in particular, when\nthree persons align before the footlights and scream at the top of\ntheir voices, for a good half hour, about how important it is not to\ndisturb anybody, I have never been able to regard quite seriously.\n\nSo I was spending this evening sedately in my own apartments at the\nContinental; and meanwhile I lisped in numbers that (or I flattered\nmyself) had a Homeric tang; and at times chewed the end of my pencil\nmeditatively. \"From present indications,\" I was considering, \"that\nRussian woman is cooking something on her chafing-dish again. It\nusually affects them that way about dawn.\"\n\nI began on the next verse viciously, and came a cropper over the clash\nof two sibilants, as the distant clamour increased. \"Brutes!\" said I,\ndisapprovingly. \"Sere, clear, dear--Now they have finished, '_Jamais,\nmonsieur_', and begun crying, 'Fire!' Oh, this would draw more than\nthree souls out of a weaver, you know! Mere, near, hemisphere--no, but\nthe Greeks thought it was flat. By Jove! I do smell smoke!\"\n\nWrapping my dressing-gown about me--I had afterward reason to thank the\nkindly fates that it was the green one with the white fleurs-de-lis,\nand not my customary, unspeakably disreputable bath-robe, scorched by\nthe cigarette ashes of years,--I approached the door and peeped out\ninto the empty hotel corridor. The incandescent lights glimmered mildly\nthrough a gray haze which was acrid and choking to breathe; little\npuffs of smoke crept lazily out of the lift-shaft just opposite; and\ndown-stairs all Li\u00e9ge was shouting incoherently, and dragging about the\nheavier pieces of hotel furniture.\n\n\"By Jove!\" said I, and whistled a little disconsolately as I looked\ndownward through the bars about the lift-shaft.\n\n\"Do you reckon,\" spoke a voice--a most agreeable voice,--\"we are in any\ndanger?\"\n\nThe owner of the voice was tall; not even the agitation of the moment\nprevented my observing that, big as I am, her eyes were almost on a\nlevel with my shoulder. They were not unpleasant eyes, and a stray\ndream or two yet lingered under their heavy lids. The owner of the\nvoice wore a strange garment that was fluffy and pink,--pale pink like\nthe lining of a sea-shell--and billows of white and the ends of various\nblue ribbons peeped out about her neck. I made mental note of the fact\nthat disordered hair is not necessarily unbecoming; it sometimes has\nthe effect of an unusually heavy halo set about the face of a\nhalf-awakened angel.\n\n\"It would appear,\" said I, meditatively, \"that, in consideration of our\nbeing on the fifth floor, with the lift-shaft drawing splendidly, and\nthe stairs winding about it,--except the two lower flights, which have\njust fallen in,--and in consideration of the fire department's probable\nincompetence to extinguish anything more formidable than a tar-barrel,\n--yes, it would appear, I think, that we might go further than\n'dangerous' and find a less appropriate adjective to describe the\nsituation.\"\n\n\"You mean we cannot get down?\" The beautiful voice was tremulous.\n\nAnd my silence made reply.\n\n\"Well, then,\" she suggested, cheerfully, after due reflection, \"since\nwe can't go down, why not go up?\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, nothing could be more simple. We were on the top\nfloor of the hotel, and beside us, in the niche corresponding to the\nstairs below, was an iron ladder that led to a neatly-whitewashed\ntrapdoor in the roof. Adopting her suggestion, I pushed against this\ntrap-door and found that it yielded readily; then, standing at the top\nof the ladder, I looked about me on a dim expanse of tiles and\nchimneys; yet farther off were the huddled roofs and gables of Li\u00e9ge,\nand just a stray glimpse of the Meuse; and above me brooded a clear sky\nand the naked glory of the moon.\n\n\n 3\n\nI lowered my head with a distinct sigh of relief.\n\n\"I say,\" I called, \"it is infinitely nicer up here--superb view of the\ncity, and within a minute's drop of the square! Better come up.\"\n\n\"Go first,\" said she; and subsequently I held for a moment a very\nslender hand--a ridiculously small hand for a woman whose eyes were\nalmost on a level with my shoulder,--and we two stood together on the\nroof of the H\u00f4tel Continental. We enjoyed, as I had predicted, an\nunobstructed view of Li\u00e9ge and of the square, wherein two toy-like\nengines puffed viciously and threw impotent threads of water against\nthe burning hotel beneath us, and, at times, on the heads of an excited\nthrong erratically clad.\n\nBut I looked down moodily, \"That,\" said I, as a series of small\nexplosions popped like pistol shots, \"is the caf\u00e9; and, oh, Lord! there\ngoes the only decent Scotch in all Li\u00e9ge!\"\n\n\"There is Mamma!\" she cried, excitedly; \"there!\" She pointed to a stout\nwoman, who, with a purple? shawl wrapped about her head, was wringing\nher hands as heartily as a bird-cage, held in one of them, would\npermit. \"And she has saved Bill Bryan!\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said I, \"I suppose it is clearly my duty to rescue the\nremaining member of the family. You see,\" I continued, in bending over\nthe trap-door and tugging at the ladder, \"this thing is only about\ntwenty feet long; but the kitchen wing of the hotel is a little less\nthan that distance from the rear of the house behind it; and with this\nas a bridge I think we might make it. In any event, the roof will be\ndone for in a half-hour, and it is eminently worth trying.\" I drew the\nladder upward.\n\nThen I dragged this ladder down the gentle slant of the roof, through a\nmaze of ghostly chimneys and dim skylights, to the kitchen wing, which\nwas a few feet lower than the main body of the building. I skirted the\nchimney and stepped lightly over the eaves, calling, \"Now then!\" when a\nmuffled cry, followed by a crash in the courtyard beneath, shook my\nheart into my mouth. I turned, gasping; and found the girl lying safe,\nbut terrified, on the verge of the roof.\n\n\"It was a bucket,\" she laughed, \"and I stumbled over it,--and it\nfell--and--and I nearly did,--and I am frightened!\"\n\nAnd somehow I was holding her hand in mine, and my mouth was making\nirrelevant noises, and I was trembling. \"It was close, but--look here,\nyou must pull yourself together!\" I pleaded; \"because we haven't, as it\nwere, the time for airy badinage and repartee--just now.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" she cried, hysterically. \"Oh, I am so frightened! I can't!\"\n\n\"You see,\" I said, with careful patience, \"we must go on. I hate to\nseem too urgent, but we _must_, do you understand?\" I waved my hand\ntoward the east. \"Why, look!\" said I, as a thin tongue of flame leaped\nthrough the open trap-door and flickered wickedly for a moment against\nthe paling gray of the sky.\n\nShe saw and shuddered. \"I'll come,\" she murmured, listlessly, and rose\nto her feet.\n\n\n 4\n\nI heaved another sigh of relief, and waving her aside from the ladder,\ndragged it after me to the eaves of the rear wing. As I had foreseen,\nthis ladder reached easily to the eaves of the house behind the rear\nwing, and formed a passable though unsubstantial-looking bridge. I\nregarded it disapprovingly.\n\n\"It will only bear one,\" said I; \"and we will have to crawl over\nseparately after all. Are you up to it?\"\n\n\"Please go first,\" said she, very quiet. And, after gazing into her\nface for a moment, I crept over gingerly, not caring to look down into\nthe abyss beneath.\n\nThen I spent a century in impotence, watching a fluffy, pink figure\nthat swayed over a bottomless space and moved forward a hair's breadth\neach year. I made no sound during this interval. In fact, I do not\nremember drawing a really satisfactory breath from the time I left the\nhotel-roof, until I lifted a soft, faint-scented, panting bundle to the\nroof of the Councillor von Hollwig.\n\n\n 5\n\n\"You are,\" I cried, with conviction, \"the bravest, the most--er--the\nbravest woman I ever knew!\" I heaved a little sigh, but this time of\ncontent. \"For I wonder,\" said I, in my soul, \"if you have any idea what\na beauty you are! what a wonderful, unspeakable beauty you are! Oh, you\nare everything that men ever imagined in dreams that left them weeping\nfor sheer happiness--and more! You are--you, and I have held you in my\narms for a moment; and, before high heaven, to repurchase that\nprivilege I would consent to the burning of three or four more hotels\nand an odd city or so to boot!\" But, aloud, I only said, \"We are quite\nsafe now, you know.\"\n\nShe laughed, bewilderingly. \"I suppose,\" said she, \"the next thing is\nto find a trap-door.\"\n\nBut there were, so far as we could discover, no trapdoors in the roof\nof the Councillor von Hollwig, or in the neighbouring roofs; and, after\nsearching three of them carefully, I suggested the propriety of waiting\ntill dawn to be melodramatically rescued.\n\n\"You see,\" I pointed out, \"everybody is at the fire over yonder. But we\nare quite safe here, I would say, with an entire block of houses to\npromenade on; moreover, we have cheerful company, eligible central\nlocation in the very heart of the city, and the superb spectacle of a\nbig fire at exactly the proper distance. Therefore,\" I continued, and\nwith severity, \"you will please have the kindness to explain your\nmotives for wandering about the corridors of a burning hotel at four\no'clock in the morning.\"\n\nShe sat down against a chimney and wrapped her gown about her. \"I sleep\nvery soundly,\" said she, \"and we did both museums and six churches and\nthe Palais de Justice and a deaf and dumb place and the cannon-foundry\ntoday,--and the cries awakened me,--and I reckon Mamma lost her head.\"\n\n\"And left you,\" thought I, \"left you--to save a canary-bird! Good Lord!\nAnd so, you are an American and a Southerner as well.\"\n\n\"And you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Ah--oh, yes, me!\" I awoke sharply from admiration of her trailing\nlashes. The burning hotel was developing a splendid light wherein to\nsee them. \"I was writing--and I thought that Russian woman had a few\nfriends to supper,--and I was looking for a rhyme when I found you,\" I\nconcluded, with a fine coherence.\n\nShe looked up. It was incredible, but those heavy lashes disentangled\nquite easily. I was seized with a desire to see them again perform this\ninteresting feat. \"Verses?\" said she, considering my slippers in a new\nlight.\n\n\"Yes,\" I admitted, guiltily--\"of Helen.\"\n\nShe echoed the name. It is an unusually beautiful name when properly\nspoken. \"Why, that is my name, only we call it Elena.\"\n\n\"Late of Troy Town,\" said I, in explanation.\n\n\"Oh!\" The lashes fell into their former state. It was hopeless this\ntime; and manual aid would be required, inevitably. \"I should think,\"\nsaid my compatriot, \"that live women would be more--inspiring\"\n\n\"Surely,\" I assented. I drew my gown about me and sat down. \"But, you\nsee, she is alive--to me.\" And I dwelt a trifle upon the last word.\n\n\"One would gather,\" said she, meditatively, \"that you have an\nunrequited attachment for Helen of Troy.\"\n\nI sighed a melancholy assent. The great eyes opened to their utmost.\nThe effect was as disconcerting as that of a ship firing a broadside at\nyou, but pleasanter. \"Tell me all about it,\" said she, coaxingly.\n\n\"I have always loved her,\" I said, with gravity. \"Long ago, when I was\na little chap, I had a book--_Stories of the Trojan War_, or something\nof the sort. And there I first read of Helen--and remembered. There\nwere pictures--outline pictures,--of quite abnormally straight-nosed\nwarriors, with flat draperies which amply demonstrated that the laws of\ngravity were not yet discovered; and the pictures of slender goddesses,\nwho had done their hair up carefully and gone no further in their\ndressing. Oh, the book was full of pictures,--and Helen's was the most\nmanifestly impossible of them all. But I knew--I knew, even then, of\nher beauty, of that flawless beauty which made men's hearts as water\nand drew the bearded kings to Ilium to die for the woman at sight of\nwhom they had put away all memories of distant homes and wives; that\nflawless beauty which buoyed the Trojans through the ten years of\nfighting and starvation, just with delight in gazing upon Queen Helen\nday by day, and with the joy of seeing her going about their streets.\nFor I remembered!\" And as I ended, I sighed effectively.\n\n\"I know,\" said she.\n\n\"'Or ever the knightly years had gone\nWith the old world to the grave,\nI was a king in Babylon\nAnd you were a Christian slave.'\"\n\n\"Yes, only I was the slave, I think, and you--er--I mean, there goes\nthe roof, and it is an uncommonly good thing for posterity you thought\nof the trap-door. Good thing the wind is veering, too. By Jove! look at\nthose flames!\" I cried, as the main body of the Continental toppled\ninward like a house of cards; \"they are splashing, actually splashing,\nlike waves over a breakwater!\"\n\nI drew a deep breath and turned from the conflagration, only to\nencounter its reflection in her widened eyes. \"Yes, I was a Trojan\nwarrior,\" I resumed; \"one of the many unknown men who sought and found\ndeath beside Scamander, trodden down by Achilles or Diomedes. So they\ndied knowing they fought in a bad cause, but rapt with that joy they\nhad in remembering the desire of the world and her perfect loveliness.\nShe scarcely knew that I existed; but I had loved her; I had overheard\nsome laughing words of hers in passing, and I treasured them as men\ntreasure gold. Or she had spoken, perhaps--oh, day of days!--to me, in\na low, courteous voice that came straight from the back of the throat\nand blundered very deliciously over the perplexities of our alien\nspeech. I remembered--even as a boy, I remembered.\"\n\nShe cast back her head and laughed merrily. \"I reckon,\" said she, \"you\nare still a boy, or else you are the most amusing lunatic I ever met.\"\n\n\"No,\" I murmured, and I was not altogether playacting now, \"that tale\nabout Polyxo was a pure invention. Helen--and the gods be praised for\nit!--can never die. For it is hers to perpetuate that sense of\nunattainable beauty which never dies, which sways us just as potently\nas it did Homer, and Dr. Faustus, and the Merovingians too, I suppose,\nwith memories of that unknown woman who, when we were boys, was very\ncertainly some day, to be our mate. And so, whatever happens, she\n\n\"Abides the symbol of all loveliness,\nOf beauty ever stainless in the stress\nOf warring lusts and fears.\n\n\"For she is to each man the one woman that he might have loved\nperfectly. She is as old as youth, she is more old than April even, and\nshe is as ageless. And, again like youth and April, this Helen goes\nabout the world in varied garments, and to no two men is her face the\nsame. Oh, very often she transmutes her fleshly covering. But through\ncountless ages I, like every man alive, have followed her, and fought\nfor her, and won her, and have lost her in the end,--but always loving\nher as every man must do. And I prefer to think that some day--\" But my\nvoice here died into a whisper, which was in part due to emotion and\npartly to an inability to finish the sentence satisfactorily. The logic\nof my verses when thus paraphrased from memory, seemed rather vague.\n\n\"Yes--like Pythagoras\" she said, a bit at random. \"Oh, I know. There\nreally must be something in it, I have often thought, because you\nactually do remember having done things before sometimes.\"\n\n\"And why not? as the March Hare very sensibly demanded.\" But now my\nvoice was earnest. \"Yes, I believe that Helen always comes. Is it\nsimply a proof that I, too, am qualified to sit next to the Hatter?\" I\nspread out my hands in a helpless little gesture. \"I do not know. But I\nbelieve that she will come,--and by and by pass on, of course, as Helen\nalways does.\"\n\n\"You will know her?\" she queried, softly.\n\nNow I at last had reached firm ground. \"She will be very tall,\" I said,\n\"very tall and exquisite,--like a young birch-tree, you know, when its\nnew leaves are whispering over to one another the secrets of spring.\nYes, that is a ridiculous sounding simile, but it expresses the general\neffect of her--the _coup d'oeil_, so to speak,--quite perfectly.\nMoreover, her hair will be a miser's dream of gold; and it will hang\nheavily about a face that will be--quite indescribable, just as the\ndawn yonder is past the utmost preciosity of speech. But her face will\nflush and will be like the first of all anemones to peep through black,\ngood-smelling, and as yet unattainable earth; and her eyes will be\ndeep, shaded wells where, just as in the proverb, truth lurks.\"\n\nBut now I could not see her eyes.\n\n\"No,\" I conceded, \"I was wrong. For when men talk to her as--as they\ncannot but talk to her, her face will flush dull red, almost like\nsmouldering wood; and she will smile a little, and look out over a\ngreat fire, such as that she saw on the night when Ilium was sacked and\nthe slain bodies were soft under her stumbling feet, as she fled\nthrough flaming Troy Town. And then I shall know her.\"\n\nMy companion sighed; and the woes of centuries weighed down her eyelids\nobstinately. \"It is bad enough,\" she lamented, \"to have lost all one's\nclothes--that new organdie was a dream, and I had never worn it; but to\nfind yourself in a dressing-gown--at daybreak, on a strange roof--and\nwith an unintroduced lunatic--is positively terrible!\"\n\nThe unintroduced lunatic rose to his feet and waved his hand toward the\neast. The dawn was breaking in angry scarlet and gold that spread like\nfire over half the visible horizon; the burning hotel shut out the\nremaining half with tall flames, which shouldered one another\nmonotonously, and seemed lustreless against the pure radiance of the\nsky. Chill daylight showed in melting patches through the clouds of\nblack smoke overhead.\n\nIt was a world of fire, transfigured by the austere magnificence of\ndawn and the grim splendour of the shifting, roaring conflagration; and\nat our feet lay the orchard of the Councillor von Hollwig, and there\nthe awakened birds piped querulously, and sparks fell crackling among\napple-blossoms.\n\n\"Ilium is ablaze,\" I quoted; \"and the homes of Pergamos and its\ntowering walls are now one sheet of flame.\"\n\nShe inspected the scene, critically. \"It does look like Ilium,\" she\nadmitted. \"And that,\" peering over the eaves into the deserted\nby-street, \"looks like a milkman.\"\n\nI was unable to deny this, though an angry concept crossed my mind that\nany milkman, with commendable tastes and feelings, would at this moment\nbe gaping at the fire at the other end of the block, rather than\nprosaically measuring quarts at the Councillor's side-entrance. But\nthere was no help for it, when chance thus unblushingly favoured the\nproprieties; in consequence I clung to a water-pipe, and explained the\nsituation to the milkman, with a fretted mind and King's College\nFrench.\n\nI turned to my companion. She was regarding the burning hotel with an\nimpersonal expression.\n\n\"Now I would give a deal,\" I thought, \"to know just how long you would\nprefer that milkman to take in coming back.\"\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\n_He Faces Himself and Remembers_\n\n\nInto the lobby of the H\u00f4tel d'Angleterre strolled, an hour later, a\ntall young man, in a green dressing-gown, and inquired for Charteris.\nThe latter, in evening dress, was mournfully breakfasting in his new\nquarters.\n\nCharteris sprang to his feet. I saw, with real emotion, that he had\nbeen weeping; but now he was all flippancy. \"My dear boy! I have just\ntorn my hair and the rough drafts of several cablegrams on your\naccount! Sit down at once, and try the bacon, since, for a wonder, it\nis not burnt--and, in passing, I had thought of course that you were.\"\n\nInstead, I took a drink, and went to sleep upon the nearest sofa.\n\n\n 2\n\nI was very tired, but I awakened about noon and managed to procure\nenough clothes to make myself not altogether unpresentable to the\npublic eye. Charteris had gone already about his own affairs, and I did\nnot regret it, for I meant, without delay, to follow up my adventure of\nthe night before.\n\nBut when I had come out of the Rue de la Casquette, and was approaching\nthe statue of Gretry, I came upon a very ornately-dressed woman, who\nwas about to enter en open carriage. I stared; and preposterous as it\nwas, I knew that I was not mistaken. And I said aloud, \"Signorina!\"\n\nIt was a long while before she said, \"Don't--don't ever call me that\nagain!\" And since the world in general appeared just then to be largely\nflavoured with the irresponsibility of dreams, it did not surprise me\nthat we were presently alone in somebody's sitting-room.\n\n\"I have seen you twice in Li\u00e9ge,\" she said. \"I suppose this had to come\nabout. I would have preferred to avoid it, though. Well! _che sara!_\nYou don't care for music, do you? No,--otherwise you would have known\nearlier that I am Nadine Neroni now.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I said, very quietly. I had heard, as everybody had, a deal\nconcerning the Neroni. \"I think, if you will pardon me, I will not\nintrude upon Baron von Anspach's hospitality any longer,\" I said.\n\n\"That is unworthy of you,--no, I mean it would have been unworthy of a\nboy we knew of.\" There was a long pier-glass in these luxurious rooms.\nShe led me to it now. \"Look, Bobbie. We have altered a little, haven't\nwe? I at least, am unmistakable. 'Their eyes are different, somehow',\nyou remember. You haven't changed as much,--not outwardly. I think you\nare like Dorian Gray. Yes, as soon--as soon as I could afford it, I\nread every book you ever talked about, I think. It was damnably foolish\nof me. For I've heard things. And there was a girl I tried to help in\nLondon--an Agn\u00e8s Faroy--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I said.\n\n\"She had your picture even then, poor creature. She kissed it just\nbefore she died. She didn't know that I had ever heard of you. She\nnever knew. Oh, how _could_ you!\" the Neroni said, with something very\nlike a sob, \"Or were you always--just that, at bottom?\"\n\n\"And have you ever noticed, Mademoiselle Neroni, that every one of us\nis several people? In consequence I must confess to have been\nwondering--?\"\n\n\"Well! I wasn't. You won't believe it now, perhaps. And it doesn't\nmatter, anyhow.\" Her grave voice lifted and upon a sudden was changed.\n\"Bobbie, when you had gone I couldn't stand it! I couldn't let you ruin\nyour life for me, but I could not go on as I had done before--Oh, well,\nyou'll never understand,\" she added, wearily. \"But Von Anspach had\nalways wanted me to go with him. So I wrote to him, at the Embassy. And\nafter all, what is the good of talking--now!\"\n\nWe two were curiously quiet. \"No, I suppose there is no good in talking\nnow.\" We stood there, as yet, hand in hand. The mirror was candid. \"Oh,\nSignorina, I want to laugh as God laughs, and I cannot!\"\n\n\n 3\n\nBut I lack the heart to set down all that brief and dreary talk of\nours. How does it matter what we said? We two at least knew, even as we\ntalked, that all we said meant in the outcome, nothing. Yet we talked\nawhile and spoke, I think, quite honestly.\n\nShe was not unhappy; and there were inbred Lichfeldian traditions which\nprompted me to virtuous indignation over her defects in remorse and\nmisery. There were my memories, too.\n\n\"I don't sing very well, of course, but then I'm not dependent on my\nsinging, you know. Oh, why not be truthful? And Von Anspach always sees\nto it I get the tendered of criticism--in print. And, moreover, I've a\ndeal put by. I'm a miser, _he_ says, and I suppose I am, because I know\nwhat it is to be poor. So when the rainy day comes--as of course it\nwill,--I'll have quite enough to purchase a serviceable umbrella.\nMeanwhile, I have pretty much everything I want. People talk of course,\nbut it is only on the stage they ever drive you out into a snow-storm.\nBesides, they don't talk to _me_.\"\n\nIn fine, I found that the Neroni was a very different being from Miss\nMontmorenci....\n\n\n 4\n\nThen I left her. I had not any inclination just now to pursue my fair\nElena. Rather I sat alone in my new bedroom, thinking, confusedly,\nfirst of Amelia Van Orden, and how I danced with her a good eight years\nago; of that woman who had come to me in remote Fairhaven, coming\nthrough the world's gutter, unsullied,--because that much I yet\nbelieve, although I do not know.... She may have been always the same,\neven in the old days when Lichfield thought her \"fast,\" and she was\nmore or less \"compromised,\"--and years before I met her, a blind,\ninexperienced boy. Only she may then have been a better actress than I\nsuspected.... I thought, in any event, of those execrable rhymes that\nlikened her to the Lady in _Comus_, moving serene and unafraid among a\nrabble of threatening bestial shapes; and I thought of the woman who\nwould, by this time, be with Von Anspach.\n\nFor here again were inbred Lichfieldian traditions of the sort I rarely\ndare confess to, even to myself, because they are so patently hidebound\nand ridiculous. These traditions told me that this woman, whom I had\nloved, was Von Anspach's harlot. I might--and I did--endeavor to be\nironical and to be broadminded and to be up-to-date about the whole\naffair, and generally to view the matter through the sophisticated eyes\nof the author of The Apostates, that Robert Etheridge Townsend who was\na connoisseur of ironies and human foibles; but these futilities did no\ngood at all. Lichfield had got at and into me when I was too young to\ndefend myself; and I could no more alter the inbred traditions of\nLichfield, that were a part of me, than a carpet could change its\ntexture. My traditions merely told me that the dear woman whom I\nremembered had come--in fleeing from discomforts which were unbearable,\nif that mattered--to be Von Anspach's harlot: and finding her this, my\ntraditions declined to be the least bit broadminded. In Lichfield such\nwomen were simply not respectable; nor could you get around that fact\nby going to Li\u00e9ge.\n\nThere was in the room a _Matin,_ which contained a brief account of the\nburning of the Continental, and a very lengthy one of the Neroni's\nappearance the night before. Drearily, to keep from thinking, I read a\ndeal concerning _la gracieuse cantatrice am\u00e9ricaine._ Whether or not\nshe had made a fool of me with histrionics in Fairhaven, there was no\ndoubt that she had chosen wisely in forsaking Lethbury, and the round\nof village \"Opera Houses.\" She had chosen, after all, and precisely as\nI had done, to make the most of youth while it lasted; and she\nappeared, just now, to harvest prodigally.\n\n\"On jouait Faust,\" I read, \"et jamais le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre personnage de Goethe\nn'adore plus exquise Gretchen. Miss Nadine Neroni est, en effet, une\nid\u00e9ale Marguerite \u00e0 la taille bien prise, au visage joli \u00e9clair\u00e9 des\ndeux yeux grands et doux. Et lorsqu'elle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 chanter, ce fut un\nv\u00e9ritable ravissement: sa voix se fit l'interpr\u00e8te r\u00eav\u00e9e de la divine\nmusique de Gounod, tandis que sa personne et son coeur incarnaient\nphysiquement et moralement l'h\u00e9roine de Goethe\"....\n\nAnd so on, for Von Anspach had \"seen to it,\" prodigally. And \"Oh,\nwell!\" I thought; \"if everybody else is so extravagantly pleased, what\nin heaven's name is the use of my being squeamish? Besides, she is only\ndoing what I am doing, and getting all the pleasure out of life that is\npossible. She and I are very sensible people. At least, I suppose we\nare. I wonder, though? Meanwhile, I had better go and look for that\npreposterously beautiful Elena. And a fig for the provincial notions of\nLichfield, that are poisoning me with their nonsense! and for the\nnotions of Fairhaven, too, I suppose--\"\n\n\n 5\n\nThen Charteris came into the room. \"John,\" said I, \"this is a truly\nremarkable world, and only hypercriticism would venture to suggest that\nit is probably conducted by an inveterate humourist. So lend me that\npocket-piece of yours, and we will permit chance to settle the entire\nmatter. That is the one intelligent way of treating anything which is\nreally serious. You probably believe I am Robert Etheridge Townsend,\nbut as a matter of fact, I am Hercules in the allegory. So! the\nbeautiful lady or America? Why, the eagle flutters uppermost, and from\nevery mountain side let praises ring. Accordingly I am off.\"\n\n\"And you will cross half the world,\" said Charteris, \"in the green\ndressing-gown, or in the coat which Byam borrowed for you this morning?\nI do not wish to seem inquisitive, you understand--\"\n\n\"No, I believe I am through with borrowed coats--as with yours, for\ninstance. But I am quite ready to go in my own dressing-gown if\nnecessary--\"\n\nI wheeled at the door.\n\n\"By the way, I am done with you, John. I am fond of you, and all that,\nand I sincerely admire my chimney-pot coquette--of whom you haven't\nheard,--but, after all, there are real people yonder. And by God, even\nafter two years of being pickled in alcohol and chasing after women\nthat are quite used to being chased--well, even now I am one of those\nreal people. So I am done with you and this perpetual making light of\nthings--!\"\n\n\"The Declaration of Independence,\" Charteris observed, \"is undoubtedly\nthe best thing in imaginative literature that we Americans have as yet\naccomplished; but I am sufficiently familiar with it, thank you, and I\nfind, with age, that only the more untruthful platitudes are endurable.\nOh, I predicted for you, at our first meeting, a life without\nachievements but of gusto! Now, it would appear, you plan to prance\namong an interminable saturnalia of the domestic virtues. So be it!\nbut I warn you that the house of righteousness is but a wayside inn\nupon the road to being a representative citizen.\"\n\n\"You are talking nonsense,\" I rapped out--\"and immoral nonsense.\"\n\n\"It is very strange,\" John Charteris complained, \"how so many of us\nmanage to reduce everything to a question of morality,--that is, to the\nalternative of being right or wrong. Now a man's personality, as\nsomebody or other very properly observes, has many parts besides the\nmoral area; and the intelligent, the artistic, even the religious part,\nneed not necessarily have anything to do with ethics--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said I, \"so there is a train at noon--\"\n\n\"And a virtuous man,\" continued Charteris, amicably, \"is no more the\nperfect type of humanity than an intellectual man. In fact, the lowest\nand certainly the most disagreeable type of all troublesome people is\nthat which combines an immaculate past with a limited understanding.\nThe religious tenets of this class consist of an unshakable belief that\nthe Bible was originally written in English, and contains nothing\napplicable to any of the week-days. And in consequence--\"\n\nI left him mid-course in speech. \"Words, words!\" said I; and it\nappeared to me for the moment that words were of astonishingly trivial\nimport, however carefully selected, which was in me a wholesome,\nalthough fleet, apostacy of yesterday's creed. And I sent a cablegram\nto Bettie Hamlyn.\n\n\n 6\n\nIt was on the trip homeward I first met with Celia Reindan. I then\nconsidered her a silly little nuisance....\n\nFor I crossed the Atlantic in a contained fury of repentance for the\nwasted months. I had achieved nothing that was worthy of me, and\npresently I would be dead. Why, I might die within the five minutes! I\nmight never see the lagging minute-hand of my little traveling clock\npass that next numeral, say! The thought obsessed me, especially at\nnight. Once, in a panic, I rose from my berth, and pushed the\nminute-hand forward a half-hour. \"Now, I have tricked You!\" I said,\naloud; for nervously I was footing a pretty large bill. At twenty-three\none has the funds wherewith to balance these accounts....\n\nI wanted to live normally--to live as these persons thick about me, who\nseemed to grow up, and mate, and beget, and die, in the incurious\nfashion of oxen. I wanted to think only from hand to mouth, to think if\npossible not at all, and to be guided always in the conduct of my life\nby gross and obvious truisms, so that I must be judged at last but as\none of the herd. \"And what is accustomed--what holds of familiar\nusage--had come to seem the whole essence of wisdom, on all subjects\";\nfor I wanted just the sense of companionship, irrevocable and eternal\nand commonly shared with every one of my kind. And yonder was Bettie\nHamlyn.... \"Oh, make a man of me, Bettie! just a common man!\"\n\nAnd Bettie might have done it, one considers, even then, for I was\nastir with a new impetus. Now, with a grin, the Supernal Aristophanes\nslipped the tiniest temptation in my way; to reach Fairhaven I was\ncompelled to spend some three hours of an April afternoon in Lichfield,\nwhere upon Regis Avenue was to be met, in the afternoon, everyone worth\nmeeting in Lichfield; and Stella drove there on fine afternoons, under\nthe protection of a trim and preternaturally grave tiger; and the\nafternoon was irreproachable.\n\n\n 7\n\nBy the way she looked back over her shoulder, I knew that Stella had\nnot recognized me. I stood with a yet lifted hat, irresolute.\n\n\"By Jove!\" said I, in my soul, \"then the Blagdens are in Lichfield!\nWhy, of course! they always come here after Lent. And Bettie would not\nmind; to call on them would be only courteous; and besides, Bettie need\nnot ever know. And moreover, I was always very fond of Peter.\"\n\nSo the next afternoon but four, Stella was making tea for me....\n\n\n\n\n13.\n\n_He Baits Upon the Journey_\n\n\n\"You are quite by way of being a gentleman,\" had been Stella's\ngreeting, that afternoon. Then, on a sudden, she rested both hands upon\nmy breast. When she did that you tingled all over, in an agreeable\nfashion. \"It was uncommonly decent of you to remember\", said this\nimpulsive young woman. \"It was dear of you! And the flowers were\nlovely.\"\n\n\"They ought to have been immortelles, of course,\" I apologised, \"but\nthe florist was out of them. Yes, and of daffodils, too.\" I sat down,\nand sighed, pensively. \"Dear, dear!\" said I, \"to think it was only two\nyears ago I buried my dearest hopes and aspirations and--er--all that\nsort of thing.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Stella, and selected a blue cup with dragons on it.\n\"At any rate,\" she continued, \"it is very disagreeable of you to come\nhere and prate like a death's-head on my wedding anniversary.\"\n\n\"Gracious gravy!\" said I, with a fine surprise, \"so it is an\nanniversary with you, too?\" She was absorbed in the sugar-bowl. \"What a\ncoincidence!\" I suggested, pleasantly.\n\nI paused. The fire crackled. I sighed.\n\n\"You are such poor company, nowadays, even after the advantages of\nforeign travel,\" Stella reflected. \"You really ought to do something to\nenliven yourself.\" After a little, she brightened as to the eyes, and\nconcentrated them upon the tea-making, and ventured a suggestion. \"Why\nnot fall in love?\" said Stella.\n\n\"I am,\" I confided, \"already in that deplorable condition.\"\nAnd I ventured on sigh number two.\n\n\"I don't mean--anything silly,\" said she, untruthfully. \"Why,\" she\ncontinued, with a certain lack of relevance, \"why not fall in love with\nsomebody else?\" Thereupon, I regret to say, her glance strayed toward\nthe mirror. Oh, she was vain,--I grant you that. But I must protest she\nhad a perfect right to be.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, quite gravely, \"that is the reason.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Stella, and tossed her head. She now assumed her most\nmatronly air, and did mysterious things with a perforated silver ball.\nI was given to understand I had offended, by a severe compression of\nher lips, which, however, was not as effective as it might have been.\nThey twitched too mutinously.\n\n\n 2\n\nStella was all in pink, with golden fripperies sparkling in\nunanticipated localities. Presumably the gown was tucked and ruched and\nappliqu\u00e9d, and had been subjected to other processes past the\ncomprehension of trousered humanity; it was certainly becoming.\n\nI think there was an eighteenth-century flavour about it,--for it\nsmacked, somehow, of a patched, mendacious, dainty womanhood, and its\nartfulness was of a gallant sort that scorned to deceive. It defied\nyou, it allured you, it conquered you at a glance. It might have been\nthe last cry from the court of an innocent Louis Quinze. It was, in\nfine, inimitable; and if only I were a milliner, I would describe for\nyou that gown in some not unbefitting fashion. As it is, you may draft\nthe world's modistes to dredge the dictionary, and they will fail, as\nignominiously as I would do, in the attempt.\n\nFor, after all, its greatest charm was that it contained Stella, and\nconverted Stella into a marquise--not such an one as was her sister,\nthe Marquise d'Arlanges, but a marquise out of Watteau or of Fragonard,\nsay. Stella in this gown seemed out of place save upon a high-backed\nstone bench, set in an _all\u00e9e_ of lime-trees, of course, and under a\nviolet sky,--with a sleek abb\u00e9 or two for company, and with beribboned\ngentlemen tinkling on their mandolins about her.\n\nI had really no choice but to regard her as an agreeable anachronism\nthe while she chatted with me, and mixed hot water and sugar and lemon\ninto ostensible tea. She seemed so out of place,--and yet, somehow, I\nentertained no especial desire upon this sleety day to have her\ndifferent, nor, certainly, otherwhere than in this pleasant, half-lit\nroom, that consisted mostly of ambiguous vistas where a variety of\nbrass bric-\u00e0-brac blinked in the firelight.\n\nWe had voted it cosier without lamps or candles, for this odorous\ntwilight was far more companionable. Odorous, for there were a great\nnumber of pink roses about. I imagine that someone must have sent\nthem--because there were not any daffodils obtainable, by reason of the\nlate and nipping frost--in honour of Stella's second wedding\nanniversary.\n\n\n 3\n\n\"Peter says you talk to everybody that way,\" quoth she,--almost\nresentfully, and after a pause.\n\n\"Oh!\" said I. For it was really no affair of Peter's. And so--\n\n\"Peter, everybody tells me, is getting fat,\" I announced, presently.\n\nStella witheringly glanced toward the region where my waist used to be.\n\"He isn't!\" said she, indignant.\n\n\"Quite like a pig, they assure me,\" I continued, with relish. She\nobjected to people being well-built. \"His obscene bloatedness appears\nto be an object of general comment.\"\n\nSilence. I stirred my tea.\n\n\"Dear Peter!\" said she. And then--but unless a woman of Stella's sort\nis able to exercise a proper control over her countenance, she has\nabsolutely no right to discuss her husband with his bachelor friends.\nIt is unkind; for it causes them to feel like social outcasts and\nlumbering brutes and Peeping Toms. If they know the husband well, it\npositively awes them; for, after all, it is a bit overwhelming, this\nsudden glimpse of the simplicity, and the credulity, and the merciful\nblindness of women in certain matters. Besides, a bachelor has no\nbusiness to know such things; it merely makes him envious and\nuncomfortable.\n\nAccordingly, \"Stella,\" said I, with firmness, \"if you flaunt your\nconnubial felicity in my face like that, I shall go home.\"\n\nShe was deaf to my righteous rebuke. \"Peter is in Washington this\nweek,\" she went on, looking fondly into the fire. \"I had planned a\nparty to celebrate to-day, but he was compelled to go--business, you\nknow. He is doing so well nowadays,\" she said, after a little, \"that I\nam quite insufferably proud of him. And I intend for him to be a great\nlawyer--oh, much the greatest in America. And I won't ever be content\ntill then.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said I. \"H'm\" seemed fairly non-committal.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Stella declared, irrelevantly, \"I almost wish I had been\nborn a man.\"\n\n\"I wish you had been,\" quoth I, in gallant wise. \"There are so few\nreally attractive men!\"\n\nStella looked up with a smile that was half sad.\n\n\"I'm just a little butterfly-woman, aren't I?\" she asked.\n\n\"You are,\" I assented, with conviction, \"a butterfly out of a queen's\ngarden--a marvellous pink-and-gold butterfly, such as one sees only in\ndreams and--er--in a London pantomime. You are a decided ornament to\nthe garden,\" I continued, handsomely, \"and the roses bow down in\nadmiration as you pass, and--ah--at least, the masculine ones do.\"\n\n\"Yes,--we butterflies don't love one another overmuch, do we? Ah, well,\nit scarcely matters! We were not meant to be taken seriously, you\nknow,--only to play in the sunlight, and lend an air to the garden\nand--amuse the roses, of course. After all,\" Stella summed it up, \"our\nduties are very simple; first, we are expected to pass through a\ncertain number of cotillions and a certain number of various happenings\nin various t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates; then to make a suitable match,--so as to\nenable the agreeable detrimentals to make love to us, with perfect\nsafety--as you were doing just now, for instance. And after that, we\ndevelop into bulbous chaperones, and may aspire eventually to a kindly\nquarter of a column in the papers, and, quite possibly, the honour of\nhaving as many as two dinners put off on account of our death.\nYes, it is very simple. But, in heaven's name,\" Stella demanded, with a\nsudden lift of speech, \"how can any woman--for, after all, a woman is\npresumably a reasoning animal--be satisfied with such a life! Yet that\nis everything--everything!--this big world offers to us shallow-minded\nbutterfly-women!\"\n\nPersonally, I disapprove of such morbid and hysterical talk outside of\na problem novel; there I heartily approve of it, on account of the\nconsiderable and harmless pleasure that is always to be derived from\nthrowing the book into the fireplace. And, coming from Stella, this\nfarrago doubly astounded me. She was talking grave nonsense now,\nwhereas Nature had, beyond doubt, planned her to discuss only the\nlighter sort. So I decided it was quadruply absurd, little Stella\ntalking in this fashion,--Stella, who, as all knew, was only meant to\nbe petted and flattered and flirted with.\n\nAnd therefore, \"Stella,\" I admonished, \"you have been reading something\nindigestible.\" I set down my teacup, and I clasped my hands. \"Don't\ntell me,\" I pleaded, \"that you want to vote!\"\n\nShe remained grave. \"The trouble is,\" said she, \"that I am not really a\nbutterfly, for all my tinsel wings. I am an ant.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said I, shamelessly, \"I hadn't heard that Lizzie had an item for\nthe census man. I don't care for brand-new babies, though; they always\nlook so disgracefully sun-burned.\"\n\nThe pun was atrocious and, quite properly, failed to win a smile or\neven a reproof from the morbid young person opposite. \"My grandfather,\"\nsaid she in meditation, \"began as a clerk in a country store. Oh of\ncourse, we have discovered, since he made his money and since Mother\nmarried a Musgrave, that his ancestors came over with William the\nConqueror, and that he was descended from any number of potentates. But\nhe lived. He was a rip at first--ah, yes, I'm glad of that as well,\n--and he became a religious fanatic because his oldest son died very\nhorribly of lockjaw. And he browbeat people and founded banks, and made\na spectacle of himself at every Methodist conference, and everybody was\nafraid of him and honoured him. And I fancy I am prouder of Old Tim\nIngersoll than I am of any of the emperors and things that make such a\nfine show in the Musgrave family tree. For I am like him. And I want to\nleave something in the world that wasn't there before I came. I want my\nlife to count, I want--why, a hundred years from now I _do_ want to be\nsomething more than a name on a tombstone. I--oh, I daresay it _is_\nonly my ridiculous egotism,\" she ended, with a shrug and Stella's usual\nquick smile,--a smile not always free from insolence, but always\nsatisfactory, somehow.\n\n\"It's late hours,\" I warned her, with uplifted forefinger, \"late hours\nand too much bridge and too many sweetmeats and too much bothering over\nsilly New Women ideas. What is the sense of a woman's being useful,\" I\ndemanded, conclusively, \"when it is so much easier and so much more\nagreeable all around for her to be adorable?\"\n\nShe pouted. \"Yes,\" she assented, \"that is my career--to be adorable. It\nis my one accomplishment,\" she declared, unblushingly,--yet not without\nsubstantiating evidence.\n\nAfter a little, though, her gravity returned. \"When I was a girl--oh, I\ndreamed of accomplishing all sorts of beautiful and impossible things!\nBut, you see, there was really nothing I could do. Music, painting,\nwriting--I tried them all, and the results were hopeless. Besides, Rob,\nthe women who succeed in anything like that are always so queer\nlooking. I couldn't be expected to give up my complexion for a career,\nyou know, or to wear my hair like a golf-caddy's. At any rate, I\ncouldn't make a success by myself. But there was one thing I could do,\n--I could make a success of Peter. And so,\" said Stella, calmly, \"I did\nit.\"\n\nI said nothing. It seemed expedient.\n\n\"You know, he was a little--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I assented, hastily. Peter had gone the pace, of course, but\nthere was no need of raking that up. That was done with, long ago.\n\n\"Well, he isn't the least bit dissipated now. You know he isn't. That\nis the first big thing I have done.\" Stella checked it off with a\nsmall, spear-pointed, glinting finger-nail. \"Then--oh, I have helped\nhim in lots of ways. He is doing splendidly in consequence; and it is\nmy part to see that the proper people are treated properly.\"\n\nStella reflected a moment. \"There was the last appointment, for\ninstance. I found that the awarding of it lay with that funny old Judge\nWilloughby, with the wart on his nose, and I asked him for it--not the\nwart, you understand,--and got it. We simply had him to dinner, and I\nwas specially butterfly; I fluttered airily about, was as silly as I\nknew how to be, looked helpless and wore my best gown. He thought me a\npretty little fool, and gave Peter the appointment. That is only an\ninstance, but it shows how I help.\" Stella regarded me, uncertainly.\n\"Why, but an authorman ought to understand!\"\n\nOf a sudden I understood a number of things--things that had puzzled.\nThis was the meaning of Stella's queer dinner the night before, and the\nensuing theatre-party, for instance; this was the explanation of those\nimpossible men, vaguely heralded as \"very influential in politics,\" and\nof the unaccountable women, painfully condensed in every lurid shade of\nsatin, and so liberally adorned with gems as to make them almost\nvaluable. Stella, incapable by nature of two consecutive ideas, was\ndetermined to manipulate the unseen wires, and to be, as she probably\nphrased it, the power behind the throne....\n\n\"Eh, it would be laughable,\" I thought, \"were not her earnestness so\npathetic! For here is Columbine mimicking Semiramis.\"\n\nYet it was true that Peter Blagden had made tremendous strides in his\nprofession, of late. For a moment, I wondered--? Then I looked at this\nbutterfly young person opposite, and I frowned. \"I don't like it,\" I\nsaid, decisively. \"It is a bit cold-blooded. It isn't worthy of you,\nStella.\"\n\n\"It is my career,\" she flouted me, with shrugging shoulders. \"It is the\none career the world--our Lichfield world--has left me. And I am doing\nit for Peter.\"\n\nThe absurd look that I objected to--on principle, you understand--\nreturned at this point in the conversation. I arose, resolutely, for I\nwas really unable to put up with her nonsense.\n\n\"You are in love with your husband,\" I grumbled, \"and I cannot\ncountenance such eccentricities. These things are simply not done--\"\n\nShe touched my hand. \"Old crosspatch, and to think how near I came to\nmarrying you.\"\n\n\"I do think of it--sometimes. So you had better stop pawing at me. It\nisn't safe.\"\n\nI wish I could describe her smile. I wish I knew just what it was that\nStella wanted me to say or do as we stood for a moment silent, in this\npleasant, half-lit room where brass things blinked in the firelight.\n\n\"Old crosspatch!\" she repeated....\n\n\"Stella,\" said I, with dignity, \"I wish it distinctly understood that I\nam not a funny old judge with a wart on his nose.\"\n\nWhereupon I went away.\n\n\n\n\n14.\n\n_He Participates in a Brave Jest_\n\n\nStella drove on fine afternoons, under the protection of a trim and\npreternaturally grave tiger. The next afternoon, by a Lichfieldian\ntransition, was irreproachable. I was to remember, afterward, wondering\nin a vague fashion, as the equipage passed, if the boy's lot was not\nrather enviable. There might well be less attractive methods of earning\nthe daily bread and butter than to whirl through life behind Stella.\nOne would rarely see her face, of course, but there would be such\ncompensations as an unfailing sense of her presence, and the faint\nodour of her hair at times and, always, blown scraps of her laughter or\nshreds of her talk, and, almost always, the piping of the sweet voice\nthat was stilled so rarely.\n\nPerhaps the conscienceless tiger listened when she was \"seeing the\nproper people were treated properly\"? Yes, one would. Perhaps he ground\nhis teeth? Well, one would, I suspected. And perhaps--?\n\nThere was a nod of recognition from Stella; and I lifted my hat as they\nbowled by toward the Reservoir. I went down Regis Avenue, mildly\nresentful that she had not offered me a lift.\n\n\n 2\n\nA vagrant puff of wind was abroad in the Boulevard that afternoon. It\npaused for a while to amuse itself with a stray bit of paper. Presently\nthe wind grew tired of this plaything and tossed between the eyes of a\nsorrel horse. Prince lurched and bolted; and Rex, always a vicious\nbrute, followed his mate. One fancies the vagabond wind must have\nlaughed over that which ensued.\n\nAfter a moment it returned and lifted a bit of paper from the roadway,\nwith a new respect, perhaps, and the two of them frolicked away over\nclose-shaven turf. It was a merry game they played there in the spring\nsunlight. The paper fluttered a little, whirled over and over, and\nscuttled off through the grass; with a gust of mirth, the wind was\nafter it, now gained upon it, now lost ground in eddying about a tree,\nand now made up the disadvantage in the open, and at last chuckled over\nits playmate pinned to the earth and flapping in sharp, indignant\nremonstrances. Then _da capo_.\n\nIt was a merry game that lasted till the angry sunset had flashed its\nfinal palpitant lance through the treetrunks farther down the roadway.\nThere were gaping people in this place, and broken wheels and shafts,\nand a policeman with a smoking pistol, and two dead horses, and a\nhorrible looking dead boy in yellow-topped boots. Somebody had\ncharitably covered his face with a handkerchief; and men were lifting a\nlimp, white heap from among the splintered rubbish.\n\nThen wind and paper played half-heartedly in the twilight until the\nnight had grown too chilly for further sport. There was no more murder\nto be done; and so the vagabond wind was puffed out into nothingness,\nand the bit of paper was left alone, and at about this season the big\nstars--the incurious stars--peeped out of heaven, one by one.\n\n\n 3\n\nIt was Stella's sister, the Marquise d'Arlanges, who sent for me that\nnight. Across the street a hand-organ ground out its jingling tune as\nLizzie's note told me what the playful wind had brought about. It was a\ndespairing, hopeless and insistent air that shrilled and piped across\nthe way. It seemed very appropriate.\n\nThe doctors feared--Ah, well, telegrams had failed to reach Peter in\nWashington. Peter Blagden was not in Washington, he had not been in\nWashington. He could not be found. And did I think--?\n\nNo, I thought none of the things that Stella's sister suggested. Of a\nsudden I knew. I stood silent for a little and heard that damned,\nclutching tune cough and choke and end; I heard the renewed babblement\nof children; and I heard the organ clatter down the street, and set up\nits faint jingling in the distance. And I knew with an unreasoning\nsurety. I pitied Stella now ineffably, not for the maiming and crippling\nof her body, for the spoiling of that tender miracle, that white flower\nof flesh, but for the falling of her air-castle, the brave air-castle\nwhich to her meant everything. I guessed what had happened.\n\nLater I found Peter Blagden, no matter where. It is not particularly to\nmy credit that I knew where to look for him. Yet the French have a\nsaying of infinite wisdom in their _qui a bu boira_. The old vice had\ngripped the man, irresistibly, and he had stolen off to gratify it in\nsecret; and he had not been sober for a week. He was on the verge of\ncollapse even when I told him--oh, with a deliberate cruelty, I grant\nyou,--what had happened that afternoon.\n\nThen, swiftly, his demolishment came; and I could not--could not for\nvery shame--bring this shivering, weeping imbecile to the bedside of\nStella, who was perhaps to die that night. Such was the news I brought\nto Stella's sister; through desolate streets already blanching in the\ndawn.\n\nStella was calling for Peter. We manufactured explanations.\n\n\n 4\n\nNice customs curtsey to death. I am standing at Stella's bedside, and\nthe white-capped nurse has gone. There are dim lights about the room,\nand heavy carts lumber by in the dawn without. A petulant sparrow is\ncheeping somewhere.\n\n\"Tell me the truth,\" says Stella, pleadingly. Her face, showing over\nbillows of bedclothes, is as pale as they. But beautiful, and\nexceedingly beautiful, is Stella's face, now that she is come to die.\n\nIt heartened me to lie to her. Peter had been retained in the great\nWestern Railway case. He had been called to Denver, San Francisco\nand--I forget today just why or even whither. He had kept it as a\nsurprise for her. He was hurrying back. He would arrive in two days. I\nshowed her telegrams from Peter Blagden,--clumsy forgeries I had\nconcocted in the last half-hour.\n\nOh, the story ran lamely, I grant you. But, vanity apart, I told it\nwith conviction. Stella must and should die in content; that much at\nleast I could purchase for her; and my thoughts were strangely nimble,\nthere was a devilish fluency in my speech, and lie after lie was fitted\nsomehow into an entity that surprised even me as it took plausible\nform. And I got my reward. Little by little, the doubt died from her\neyes as I lied stubbornly in a drug-scented silence; a little by a\nlittle, her cheeks flushed brighter, and ever brighter, as I dilated on\nthis wonderful success that had come to Peter Blagden, till at last her\nface was all aflame with happiness.\n\nShe had dreamed of this, half conscious of her folly; she had worked\ntoward this consummation for months. But she had hardly dared to hope\nfor absolute success; it almost worried her; and she could not be\ncertain, even now, whether it was the soup or her blue silk that had\ninfluenced Allardyce most potently. Both had been planned to wheedle\nhim, to gain this glorious chance for Peter Blagden....\n\n\"You--you are sure you are not lying?\" said Stella, and smiled in\nspeaking, for she believed me infinitely.\n\n\"Stella, before God, it is true!\" I said, with fervour. \"On my word of\nhonour, it is as I tell you!\" And my heart was sick within me as I\nthought of the stuttering brute, the painted female thing with tumbled\nhair, and the stench of liquor in the room--Ah, well, the God I called\nto witness strengthened me to smile back at Stella.\n\n\"I believe you,\" she said, simply. \"I--I am glad. It is a big thing for\nPeter.\" Her eyes widened in wonder and pride, and she dreamed for just\na moment of his future. But, upon a sudden, her face fell. \"Dear,\ndear!\" said Stella, petulantly; \"I'd forgotten. I'll be dead by then.\"\n\n\"Stella! Stella!\" I cried, and very hoarsely; \"why--why, nonsense,\nchild! The doctor thinks--he is quite sure, I mean--\" I had a horrible\ndesire to laugh. Heine was right; there is an Aristophanes in heaven.\n\n\"Ah, I know,\" she interrupted. \"I am a little afraid to die,\" she went\non, reflectively. \"If one only knew--\" Stella paused for a moment; then\nshe smiled. \"After all,\" she said, \"it isn't as if I hadn't\naccomplished anything. I have made Peter. The ball is at his feet now;\nhe has only to kick it. And I helped.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I. My voice was shaken, broken out of all control. \"You\nhave helped. Why, you have done everything, Stella! There is not a\nyoung man in America with his prospects. In five years, he will be one\nof our greatest lawyers,--everybody says so--everybody! And you have\ndone it all, Stella--every bit of it! You have made a man of him, I\ntell you! Look at what he was!--and then look at what he is! And--and\nyou talk of leaving him now! Why, it's preposterous! Peter needs you, I\ntell you--he needs you to cajole the proper people and keep him steady\nand--and--Why, you artful young woman, how could he possibly get on\nwithout you, do you think? Oh, how can any of us get on without you?\nYou _must_ get well, I tell you. In a month, you will be right as a\ntrivet. You die! Why, nonsense!\" I laughed. I feared I would never have\ndone with laughter over the idea of Stella's dying.\n\n\"But I have done all I could. And so he doesn't need me now.\" Stella\nmeditated for yet another moment. \"I believe I shall always know when\nhe does anything especially big. God would be sure to tell me, you see,\nbecause He understands how much it means to me. And I shall be\nproud--ah, yes, wherever I am, I shall be proud of Peter. You see, he\ndidn't really care about being a success, for of course he knows that\nUncle Larry will leave him a great deal of money one of these days. But\nI am such a vain little cat--so bent on making a noise in the world,\n--that, I think, he did it more to please my vanity than anything else.\nI nagged him, frightfully, you know,\" Stella confessed, \"but he was\nalways--oh, _so_ dear about it, Rob! And he has never failed me--not\neven once, although I know at times it has been very hard for him.\"\nStella sighed; and then laughed. \"Yes,\" said she, \"I think I am\nsatisfied with my life altogether. Somehow, I am sure I shall be told\nabout it when he is a power in the world--a power for good, as he will\nbe,--and then I shall be very perky--somewhere. I ought to sing _Nunc\nDimittis_, oughtn't I?\" I was not unmoved; nor did it ever lie within\nmy power to be unmoved when I thought of Stella and how gaily she went\nto meet her death....\n\n\n 5\n\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said she, in a tired voice.\n\n\"Good-bye, Stella,\" said I; and I kissed her.\n\n\"And I don't think you are a mess. And I _don't_ hate you.\" She was\nsmiling very strangely. \"Yes, I remember that first time. And no matter\nwhat they said, I always cared heaps more about you, Rob, than I dared\nlet you know. And if only you had been as dependable as Peter--But, you\nsee, you weren't--\"\n\n\"No, dear, you did the right thing--what was best for all of us--\"\n\n\"Then don't mind so much. Oh, Bob, it hurts me to see you mind so much!\nYou aren't--being dependable, like Peter, even now,\" she said,\nreproachfully....\n\nHeine was right; there is an Aristophanes in heaven.\n\n\n\n\n15.\n\n_He Decides to Amuse Himself_\n\n\nI came to Fairhaven half-bedrugged with memories of Stella's funeral,\n--say, of how lightly she had lain, all white and gold, in the\ngrotesque and horrid box, and of Peter's vacant red-rimmed eyes that\nseemed to wonder why this decorous company should have assembled about\nthe deep and white-lined cavity at his feet and find no answer. Nor,\nfor that matter, could I.\n\n\"But it was flagrant, flagrant!\" my heart screeched in a grill of\nimpotent wrath. \"Eh, You gave me power to reason, so they say! and will\nYou slay me, too, if I presume to use that power? I say, then, it was\nflagrant and tyrannical and absurd! 'Let twenty pass, and stone the\ntwenty-first, Loving not, hating not, just choosing so!' O Setebos, it\nwasn't worthy of omnipotence. You know it wasn't!\" In such a frame of\nmind I came again to Bettie Hamlyn.\n\n\n 2\n\nIt was very odd to see Bettie again. I had been sublimely confident,\nthough, that we would pick up our intercourse precisely where we had\nleft off; and this, as I now know, is something which can never happen\nto anybody. So I was vaguely irritated before we had finished shaking\nhands, and became so resolutely boyish and effusive in my delight at\nseeing her that anyone in the world but Bettie Hamlyn would have been\nquite touched. And my conversational gambit, I protest, was masterly,\nand would have made anybody else think, \"Oh how candid is the egotism\nof this child!\" and would have moved that person, metaphorically\nanyhow, to pat me upon the head.\n\nBut Bettie only smiled, a little sadly, and answered:\n\n\"Your book?--Why, dear me, did I forget to write you a nice little\nletter about how wonderful it was?\"\n\n\"You wrote the letter all right. I think you copied it out of _The\nComplete Letter Writer_. There was not a bit of you in it.\"\n\n\"Well, that is why I dislike your book--because there was not a bit of\n_you_ in it. Of course I am glad it was the big noise of the month, and\nalso a little jealous of it, if you can understand that phase of the\nfeminine mind. I doubt it, because you write about women as though they\nwere pterodactyls or some other extinct animal, which you had never\nseen, but had read a lot about.\"\n\n\"Which attests, in any event, my morals to be above reproach. You\nshould be pleased.\"\n\n\"To roll it into a pill, your book seems pretty much like any other\nbook; and it has made me hold my own particular boy's picture more than\nonce against my cheek and say, 'You didn't write books, did you, dear?\n--You did nicer things than write books'--and he did .... I hear many\nthings of you....\"\n\n\"Oh, well!\" I brilliantly retorted, \"you mustn't believe all you hear.\"\nAnd I felt that matters were going very badly indeed.\n\n\"Robin, do you not know that your mess of pottage must be eaten with\nyou by the people who care for you?--and one of them dislikes pottage.\nIndeed, I _would_ have liked the book, had anybody else written it. I\nalmost like it as it is, in spots, and sometimes I even go to the great\nlength of liking you,--because 'if only for old sake's sake, dear,\nyou're the loveliest doll in the world.' There might be a better\nreason, if you could only make up your mind to dispense with\npottage....\"\n\nThe odd part of it, even to-day, is that Bettie was saying precisely\nwhat I had been thinking, and that to hear her say it made me just\ntwice as petulant as I was already.\n\n\"Now, please don't preach,\" I said. \"I've heard so much preaching\nlately--dear,\" I added, though I am afraid the word was rather\nobviously an afterthought.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot you stayed over for Stella Blagden's funeral. You were\nquite right. Stella was a dear child, and I was really sorry to hear of\nher death.\"\n\n\"Really!\" It was the lightest possible additional flick upon the raw,\nbut it served.\n\n\"Yes,--I, too, was rather sorry, Bettie, because I have loved Stella\nall my life. She was the first, you see, and, somehow, the others have\nbeen different. And--she disliked dying. I tell you, it is unfair,\nBettie,--it is hideously unfair!\"\n\n\"Robin--\" she began.\n\n\"And why should you be living,\" I said, in half-conscious absurdity,\n\"when she is dead? Why, look, Bettie! even that fly yonder is alive.\nSetebos accords an insect what He grudges Stella! Her dying is not even\nparticularly important. The big news of the day is that the President\nhas started his Pacific tour, and that the Harvard graduates object to\nhis being given an honorary degree, and are sending out seven thousand\nprotests to be signed. And you're alive, and I'm alive, and Peter\nBlagden is alive, and only Stella is dead. I suppose she is an angel by\nthis. But I don't care for angels. I want just the silly little Stella\nthat I loved,--the Stella that was the first and will always be the\nfirst with me. For I want her--just Stella--! Oh, it is an excellent\njest; and I will cap it with another now. For the true joke is, I came\nto Fairhaven, across half the world, with an insane notion of asking\nyou to marry me,--you who are 'really' sorry that Stella is dead!\" And\nI laughed as pleasantly as one may do in anger.\n\nBut the girl, too, was angry. \"Marry you!\" she said. \"Why, Robin, you\nwere wonderful once; and now you are simply not a bad sort of fellow,\nwho imagines himself to be the hit of the entire piece. And whether\nshe's dead or not, she never had two grains of sense, but just enough\nto make a spectacle of you, even now.\"\n\n\"I regret that I should have sailed so far into the north of your\nopinion,\" said I. \"Though, as I dare assert, you are quite probably in\nthe right. So I'll be off to my husks again, Bettie.\" And I kissed her\nhand. \"And that too is only for old sake's sake, dear,\" I said.\n\nThen I returned to the railway station in time for the afternoon train.\nAnd I spoke with no one else in Fairhaven, except to grunt \"Good\nevening, gentlemen,\" as I passed Clarriker's Emporium, where Colonel\nSnawley and Dr. Jeal were sitting in arm chairs, very much as I had\nleft them there two years ago.\n\n\n 3\n\nIt was a long while afterward I discovered that \"some damned\ngood-natured friend,\" as Sir Fretful has immortally phrased it, had\ntold Bettie Hamlyn of seeing me at the theatre in Lichfield, with\nStella and her marvellous dinner-company. It was by an odd quirk the\nonce Aurelia Minns, in Lichfield for the \"summer's shopping,\" who had\ntold Bettie. And the fact is that I had written Bettie upon the day of\nStella's death and, without explicitly saying so, had certainly\nconveyed the impression I had reached Lichfield that very morning, and\nwas simply stopping over for Stella's funeral. And, in addition, I\ncannot say that Bettie and Stella were particularly fond of each other.\n\nAs it was, I left Fairhaven the same day I reached it, and in some\ndissatisfaction with the universe. And I returned to Lichfield and\npresently reopened part of the old Townsend house .... \"Robert and I,\"\nmy mother had said, to Lichfield's delectation, \"just live downstairs\nin the two lower stories, and ostracise the third floor....\" And I was\nreceived by Lichfield society, if not with open arms at least with\nacquiescence. And Byam, an invaluable mulatto, the son of my cousin\nDick Townsend and his housekeeper, made me quite comfortable.\n\nDepend upon it, Lichfield knew a deal more concerning my escapades than\nI did. That I was \"deplorably wild\" was generally agreed, and a\nreasonable number of seductions, murders and arsons was, no doubt,\naccredited to me \"on quite unimpeachable authority, my dear.\"\n\nBut I was a Townsend, and Lichfield had been case-hardened to\nTownsendian vagaries since Colonial days; and, besides, I had written a\nbook which had been talked about; and, as an afterthought, I was\nreputed not to be an absolute pauper, if only because my father had\ntaken the precaution, customary with the Townsends, to marry a woman\nwith enough money to gild the bonds of matrimony. For Lichfield,\nluckily, was not aware how near my pleasure-loving parents had come,\nbetween them, to spending the last cent of this once ample fortune.\n\nAnd, in fine, \"Well, really now--?\" said Lichfield. Then there was a\ntentative invitation or two, and I cut the knot by accepting all of\nthem, and talking to every woman as though she were the solitary\nspecimen of feminity extant. It was presently agreed that gossip often\nembroidered the actual occurrence and that wild oats were, after all, a\nnot unheard-of phenomenon, and that though genius very often, in a\nphrase, forgot to comb its hair, these tonsorial deficiencies were by\nthe broadminded not appraised too strictly.\n\nI did not greatly care what Lichfield said one way or the other. I was\ntoo deeply engrossed: first, in correcting the final proofs of\n_Afield_, my second book, which appeared that spring and was built\naround--there is no harm in saying now,--my relations with Gillian\nHardress; secondly, in the remunerative and uninteresting task of\nwriting for _Woman's Weekly_ five \"wholesome love-stories with a dash\nof humor,\" in which She either fell into His arms \"with a contented\nsigh\" or else \"their lips met\" somewhere toward the ending of the\nseventh page; and, thirdly, in diverting myself with Celia Reindan....\n\n\n 4\n\nThat, though, is a business I shall not detail, because it was one of\nthe very vulgarest sort. It was the logical outgrowth of my admiration\nfor her yellow hair,--she did have extraordinary hair, confound her!\n--and of a few moonlit nights. It was simply the result of our common\nvanity and of her book-fed sentimentality and, eventually, of her\nunbridled temper; and in nature the compound was an unsavoury mess\nwhich thoroughly delighted Lichfield. Lichfield will be only too glad,\neven nowadays, to discourse to you of how I got wedged in that infernal\ntransom, and of how Celia alarmed everybody within two blocks of her\nbedroom by her wild yells.\n\n\n 5\n\nI had meanwhile decided, first, to write another and a better book than\n_The Apostates_ or _Afield_ had ever pretended to be; and afterward to\nmarry Rosalind Jemmett, whom I found, in my too-hackneyed but habitual\nphrase, \"adorable.\" For this Rosalind was an eminently \"sensible\nmatch,\" and as such, I considered, quite appropriate for a Townsend.\n\nThe main thing though, to me, was to write the book of which I had\nalready the central idea,--very vague, as yet, but of an unquestionable\nmagnificence. Development of it, on an at all commensurate scale,\nnecessitated many inconveniences, and among them, the finding of\nsomeone who would assist me in imbuing the love-scenes--of which there\nmust unfortunately be a great many--with reality; and for the tale's\n_milieu_ I again pitched upon the Green Chalybeate,--where, as you may\nremember, I first met with Stella.\n\nSo I said a not unpromising farewell to Rosalind Jemmett, who was going\ninto Canada for the summer. She was quite frankly grieved by the\nabsolute necessity of my taking a rigorous course of the Chalybeate\nwaters, but agreed with me that one's health is not to be trifled with.\nAnd of course she would write if I really wanted her to, though she\ncouldn't imagine _why_--But I explained why, with not a little detail.\nAnd she told me, truthfully, that I was talking like an idiot; and was\nnot, I thought, irrevocably disgusted by my idiocy. So that, all in\nall, I was not discontented when I left her.\n\nThen I ordered Byam to pack and, by various unveracious\nrepresentations, induced my Uncle George Bulmer--as a sort of visible\nand outward sign that I forgave him for declining to lend me another\npenny--to accompany me to the Green Chalybeate. Besides, I was fond of\nthe old scoundrel....\n\n\n 6\n\nWhen I began to scribble these haphazard memories I had designed to be\nvery droll concerning the \"provincialism\" of Lichfield; for, as every\ninhabitant of it will tell you, it is \"quite hopelessly provincial,\"\n--and this is odd, seeing that, as investigation will assure you, the\ncity is exclusively inhabited by self-confessed cosmopolitans. I had\nmeant to depict Fairhaven, too, in the broad style of _Cranford_, say;\nand to be so absolutely side-splitting when I touched upon the Green\nChalybeate as positively to endanger the existence of any apoplectic\nreader, who presumed to peruse the chapter which dealt with this\nresort.\n\nBut, upon reflection, I am too familiar with these places to attempt to\ntreat them humorously. The persons who frequent their byways are too\nmuch like the persons who frequent the byways of any other place, I\nfind, at bottom. For to write convincingly of the persons peculiar to\nany locality it is necessary either to have thoroughly misunderstood\nthem, or else perseveringly to have been absent from daily intercourse\nwith them until age has hardened the brain-cells, and you have\nforgotten what they are really like. Then, alone, you may write the\nnecessary character studies which will be sufficiently abundant in\nhuman interest.\n\nFor, at bottom, any one of us is tediously like any other.\nComprehension is the grave of sympathy; scratch deeply enough and you\nwill find not any livelily-coloured Tartarism, but just a mediocre and\nthoroughly uninteresting human being. So I may not ever be so droll as\nI had meant to be; and if you wish to chuckle over the grotesque places\nI have lived in, you must apply to persons who have spent two weeks\nthere, and no more.\n\nFor the rest, Lichfield, and Fairhaven also, got at and into me when I\nwas too young to defend myself. Therefore Lichfield and Fairhaven\ncannot ever, really, seem to me grotesque. To the contrary, it is the\nother places which must always appear to me a little queer when judged\nby the standards of Fairhaven and Lichfield.\n\n\n\n\n16.\n\n_He Seeks for Copy_\n\n\nI had aforetime ordered Mr. George Bulmer to read _The Apostates_, and,\nas the author of this volume explained, from motives that were purely\nwell-meaning. To-night I was superintending the process.\n\n\"For the scene of the book is the Green Chalybeate,\" said I; \"and it\nmay be my masterly rhetoric will so far awaken your benighted soul,\nUncle George, as to enable you to perceive what the more immediate\nscenery is really like. Why, think of it! what if you should presently\nfall so deeply in love with the adjacent mountains as to consent to\noverlook the deficiencies of the more adjacent caf\u00e9! Try now, nunky!\ntry hard to think that the right verb is really more important than the\nright vermouth! and you have no idea what good it may do you.\"\n\nMr. Bulmer read on, with a bewildered face, while I gently stirred the\ncontents of my tall and delectably odored glass. It was \"frosted\" to a\nnicety. We were drinking \"Mamie Taylors\" that summer, you may remember;\nand I had just brought up a pitcherful from the bar.\n\n\"Oh, I say, you know!\" observed Uncle George, as he finished the sixth\nchapter, and flung down the book.\n\n\"Rot, utter rot,\" I assented pleasantly; \"puerile and futile trifling\nwith fragments of the seventh commandment, as your sturdy common-sense\ninstantly detected. In fact,\" I added, hopefully, \"I think that chapter\nis trivial enough to send the book into a tenth edition. In _Afield_,\nyou know, I tried a different tack. Actuated by the noblest sentiments,\nthe heroine mixes prussic acid with her father's whiskey and water; and\n'Old-Fashioned' and 'Fair Play' have been obliging enough to write to\nthe newspapers about this harrowing instance of the deplorably low\nmoral standards of to-day. Uncle George, do you think that a real lady\nis ever justified in obliterating a paternal relative? You ought to\nmeditate upon that problem, for it is really a public question\nnowadays. Oh, and there was a quite lovely clipping last week I forgot\nto show you--all about Electra, as contrasted with Jonas Chuzzlewit,\nand my fine impersonal attitude, and the survival of the fittest, and\nso on.\"\n\nBut Uncle George refused to be comforted. \"Look here, Bob!\" said he,\npathetically, \"why don't you brace up and write something--well! we'll\nput it, something of the sort you _can_ do. For you can, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah, but is not a judicious nastiness the market-price of a second\nedition before publication?\" I softly queried. \"I had no money. I was\nashamed to beg, and I was too well brought up to steal anything\nadroitly enough not to be caught. And so, in view of my own uncle's\ndeafness to the prayers of an impecunious orphan, I have descended to\nthis that I might furnish butter for my daily bread.\" I refilled my\nglass and held the sparkling drink for a moment against the light.\n\"This time next year,\" said I, as dreamily, \"I shall be able to afford\ncake; for I shall have written _As the Coming of Dawn_.\"\n\nMr. Bulmer sniffed, and likewise refilled his glass. \"You catch me\nlending you any money for your--brief Biblical words!\" he said.\n\n\"For the reign of subtle immorality,\" I sighed, \"is well-nigh over.\nAlready the augurs of the pen begin to wink as they fable of a race of\nmen who are evilly scintillant in talk and gracefully erotic. We know\nthat this, alas, cannot be, and that in real life our peccadilloes\ndwindle into dreary vistas of divorce cases and the police-court, and\nthat crime has lost its splendour. We sin very carelessly--sordidly, at\ntimes,--and artistic wickedness is rare. It is a pity; life was once a\nscarlet volume scattered with misty-coated demons; it is now a yellow\njournal, wherein our vices are the hackneyed formulas of journalists,\nand our virtues are the not infrequent misprints. Yes, it is a pity!\"\n\n\"Dearest Robert!\" remonstrated Mr. Bulmer, \"you are sadly _pass\u00e9_: that\npose is of the Beardsley period and went out many magazines ago.\"\n\n\"The point is well taken,\" I admitted, \"for our life of to-day is\nalready reflected--faintly, I grant you,--in the best-selling books. We\nhave passed through the period of a slavish admiration for wickedness\nand wide margins; our quondam decadents now snigger in a parody of\nprimeval innocence, and many things are forgiven the latter-day poet if\nhis botany be irreproachable. Indeed, it is quite time; for we have\ntossed over the contents of every closet in the _menage \u00e0 trois_. And\nI--_moi, qui vous parle_,--I am wearied of hansom-cabs and the flaring\nlights of great cities, even as so alluringly depicted in _Afield_; and\nhenceforth I shall demonstrate the beauty of pastoral innocence.\"\n\n\"Saul among the prophets,\" Uncle George suggested, helpfully.\n\n\"Quite so,\" I assented, \"and my first prophecy will be _As the Coming\nof Dawn_.\"\n\nMr. Bulmer tapped his forehead significantly. \"Mad, quite mad!\" said\nhe, in parenthesis.\n\n\"I shall be idyllic,\" I continued, sweetly; \"I shall write of the\nineffable glory of first love. I shall babble of green fields and the\nkeen odours of spring and the shamefaced countenances of lovers, met\nafter last night's kissing. It will be the story of love that stirs\nblindly in the hearts of maids and youths, and does not know that it is\nlove,--the love which manhood has half forgotten and that youth has not\nthe skill to write of. But I, at twenty-four, shall write its story as\nit has never been written; and I shall make a great book of it, that\nwill go into thousands and thousands of editions. Yes, before heaven, I\nwill!\"\n\nI brought my fist down, emphatically, on the table.\n\n\"H'm!\" said Mr. Bulmer, dubiously; \"going back to renew associations\nwith your first love? I have tried it, and I generally find her\ngrandchildren terribly in the way.\"\n\n\"It is imperative,\" said I,--\"yes, imperative for the scope of my book,\nthat I should view life through youthful and unsophisticated eyes. I\ndiscovered that, upon the whole, Miss Jemmett is too obviously an urban\nproduct to serve my purpose. And I can't find any one who will.\"\n\nUncle George whistled softly. \"'Honourable young gentleman,'\" he\nmurmured, as to himself, \"'desires to meet attractive and innocent\nyoung lady. Object: to learn how to be idyllic in three-hundred\npages.'\"\n\nThere was no commentary upon his text.\n\n\"I say,\" queried Mr. Bulmer, \"do you think this sort of thing is fair\nto the girl? Isn't it a little cold-blooded?\"\n\n\"Respected nunky, you are at times very terribly the man in the street!\nAnyhow, I leave the Green Chalybeate to-morrow in search of _As the\nComing of Dawn_.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Mr. Bulmer, rising, \"if you start on a tour of the\ncountry, looking for assorted dawns and idylls, it will end in my\nabducting you from some rustic institution for the insane. You take a\nliver-pill and go to bed! I don't promise anything, mind, but perhaps\nabout the first I can manage a little cheque if only you will make oath\non a few Bibles not to tank up on it in Lichfield. The transoms there,\"\nhe added unkindlily, \"are not built for those full rich figures.\"\n\nNext morning, I notified the desk-clerk, and, quite casually, both the\nnewspaper correspondents, that the Green Chalybeate was about to be\nbereft of the presence of a distinguished novelist. Then, as my train\ndid not leave till night, I resolved to be bored on horseback, rather\nthan on the golf-links, and had Guendolen summoned, from the stable,\nfor a final investigation of the country roads thereabouts.\n\nGuendolen this afternoon elected to follow a new route; and knowing by\nexperience that any questioning of this decision could but result in\nundignified defeat, I assented. Thus it came about that we circled\nparallel to the boardwalk, which leads uphill to the deserted Royal\nHotel, and passed its rows of broken windows; and went downhill again,\nalways at Guendolen's election; and thus came to the creek, which\nbabbled across the roadway and was overhung with thick foliage that\nlisped and whispered cheerfully in the placid light of the declining\nsun. It was there that the germ of _As the Coming of Dawn_ was found.\n\nFor I had fallen into a reverie over the deplorable obstinacy of my new\nheroine, who declined, for all my labours, to be unsophisticated; and\ntaking advantage of this, Guendolen had twitched the reins from my hand\nand proceeded to satisfy her thirst in a manner that was rather too\nnoisy to be quite good form. I sat in patience, idly observing the\nsparkling reflection of the sunlight on the water. I was elaborating a\ncomparison between my obstinate heroine and Guendolen. Then Guendolen\nsnorted, as something rustled through the underbrush, and turning, I\nperceived a Vision.\n\nThe Vision was in white, with a profusion of open-work. There were blue\nribbons connected with it. There were also black eyes, of the\nalmond-shaped, heavy-lidded variety that I had thought existed only in\nLely's pictures, and great coils of brown hair which was gold where the\nchequered sunlight fell upon it, and two lips that were inexpressibly\nred. I was filled with pity for my tired horse, and a resolve that for\nthis once her thirst should be quenched.\n\nThereupon, I lifted my cap hastily; and Guendolen scrambled to the\nother bank, and spluttered, and had carried me well past the Iron\nSpring, before I announced to the evening air that I was a fool, and\nthat Guendolen was describable by various quite picturesque and\nderogatory epithets. And I smiled.\n\n\"Now, Robert Etheridge Townsend, you writer of books, here is a subject\nmade to your hand!\" And then:\n\n \"Only 'twixt the light and shade\nFloating memories of my maid\nMake me pray for Guendolen.\"\n\nAfter this we retraced our steps. I was peering anxiously about the\nroadway.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said I, subsequently; \"but _have_ you seen anything of a\nwatch--a small gold one, set with pearls?\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" said the Vision, sympathetically, \"what a pity! Are you sure\nit fell here?\"\n\n\"I don't seem to have it about me,\" I answered, with cryptic, but\nentire veracity. I searched about my pockets, with a puckered brow.\n\"And as we stopped here--\"\n\nI looked inquiringly into the water.\n\n\"From this side,\" observed the Vision, impersonally, \"there is less\nglare from the brook.\"\n\nHaving tied Guendolen to a swinging limb, I sat down contentedly in\nthese woods. The Vision moved a little, lest I be crowded.\n\n\"It might be further up the road,\" she suggested.\n\n\"Oh, I must have left it at the hotel,\" I observed.\n\n\"You might look--\" said she, peering into the water.\n\n\"Forever!\" I assented.\n\nThe Vision flushed, \"I didn't mean--\" she began.\n\n\"But I did,\" quoth I,--\"and every word of it.\"\n\n\"Why, in that case,\" said she, and rose to her feet, \"I'd better--\" A\nfrown wrinkled her brow; then a deep, curved dimple performed a similar\noffice for her cheek. \"I wonder--\" said she.\n\n\"Why, you would be a bold-faced jig,\" said I, composedly; \"but, after\nall there is nobody about. And, besides,--for I suspect you of being\none of the three dilapidated persons in veils who came last night,--we\nare going to be introduced right after supper, anyway.\"\n\nThe Vision sat down. \"You mentioned your sanatorium?\" quoth she.\n\n\"The Asylum of Love,\" said I; \"discharged--under a false impression,\n--as cured, and sent to paradise.\n\n\"Oh!\" said I, defiant, \"but it _is_!\"\n\nShe looked about her. \"The woods _are_ rather beautiful,\" she conceded,\nsoftly.\n\n\"They form a quite appropriate background,\" said I. \"It is a veritable\nEden, before the coming of the snake.\"\n\n\"Before?\" she queried, dubiously.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said I, and felt my ribs, in meditative wise. \"Ah, but I\nthought I missed something! We participate in a historic moment. This\nis in Eden immediately after the creation of--Well, but of course you\nare acquainted with that famous bull about Eve's being the fairest of\nher daughters?\"\n\n\"It is _quite_ time,\" said she, judicially, \"for me to go back to the\nhotel, before--since we are speaking of animals,--your presence here is\nnoticed by one of the squirrels.\"\n\n\"It is not good,\" I pleaded, \"for man to be alone.\"\n\n\"I have heard,\" said she, \"that--almost any one can cite scripture to\nhis purpose.\"\n\nI thrust out a foot for inspection. \"No suggestion of a hoof,\" said I;\n\"and not the slightest odour of brimstone, as you will kindly note; and\nmy inoffensive name is Robert Townsend.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she submitted, \"I could never think of making your\nacquaintance in this irregular fashion; and, therefore, of course, I\ncould not think of telling you that my name is Marian Winwood.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" I agreed; \"it would be highly improper.\"\n\n\"--And it is more than time for me to go to supper,\" she concluded\nagain, with a lacuna, as it seemed to me, in the deduction.\n\n\"Look here!\" I remonstrated; \"it isn't anywhere near six yet.\" I\nexhibited my watch to support this statement.\n\n\"Oh!\" she observed, with wide, indignant eyes.\n\n\"I--I mean--\" I stammered.\n\nShe rose to her feet.\n\n\"--I will explain how I happened to be carrying two watches--\"\n\n\"I do not care to listen to any explanations. Why should I?\"\n\n\"--upon,\" I firmly said, \"the third piazza of the hotel. And this very\nevening.\"\n\n\"You will not.\" And this was said even more firmly. \"And I hope you\nwill have the kindness to keep away from these woods; for I shall\nprobably always walk here in the afternoon.\" Then, with an indignant\ntoss of the head, the Vision disappeared.\n\n\n 3\n\nI whistled. Subsequently I galloped back to the hotel.\n\n\"See here!\" said I, to the desk-clerk; \"how long does this place keep\nopen?\"\n\n\"Season closes latter part of September, sir.\"\n\nI told him I would need my rooms till then.\n\n\n\n\n17.\n\n_He Provides Copy_\n\n\nSo it was Uncle George Bulmer who presently left the Green Chalybeate,\nto pursue Mrs. Chaytor with his lawless arts. I stayed out the season.\n\nNow I cannot conscientiously recommend the Green Chalybeate against\nyour next vacation. Once very long ago, it was frequented equally for\nthe sake of gaiety and of health. In the summer that was Marian's the\nresort was a beautiful and tumble-down place where invalids congregated\nfor the sake of the nauseous waters,--which infallibly demolish a solid\ncolumn of strange maladies I never read quite through, although it\nbordered every page of the writing-paper you got there from the\ndesk-clerk,--and a scanty leaven of persons who came thither,\napparently, in order to spend a week or two in lamenting \"how very dull\nthe season is this year, and how abominable the fare is.\"\n\nBut for one I praise the place, and I believe that Marian Winwood also\nbears it no ill-will. For we two were very happy there. We took part in\nthe \"subscription euchres\" whenever we could not in time devise an\nexcuse which would pass muster with the haggard \"entertainer.\" We\ndanced conscientiously beneath the pink and green icing of the\nball-room's ceiling, with all three of the band playing _Hearts and\nFlowers_; and with a dozen \"chaperones\"--whom I always suspected of\ntaking in washing during the winter months,--lined up as closely as was\npossible to the door, as if in preparation for the hotel's catching\nfire any moment, to give us pessimistic observal. And having thus\ndischarged our duty to society at large, we enjoyed ourselves\ntremendously.\n\nFor instance, we would talk over the book I was going to write in the\nautumn. That was the main thing. Then one could golf, or drive, or--I\nblush to write it even now--croquet. Croquet, though, is a much\nmaligned game, as you will immediately discover if you ever play it on\nthe rambling lawn of the Chalybeate, about six in the afternoon, say,\nwhen the grass is greener than it is by ordinary, and the shadows are\nlong, and the sun is well beneath the tree-tops of the Iron Bank, and\nyour opponent makes a face at you occasionally, and on each side the\nold, one-storied cottages are builded of unusually red bricks and are\nquite ineffably asleep.\n\nOr again there is always the creek to divert yourself in. Once I caught\nfive crawfishes there, while Marian waited on the bank; and afterward\nwe found an old tomato-can and boiled them in it, and they came out a\nreally gorgeous crimson. This was the afternoon that we were Spanish\nInquisitors.... Oh, believe me, you can have quite a good time at the\nChalybeate, if you set about it in the proper way.\n\n\n 2\n\nOnly it is true that sometimes, when it rained, say, with that hopeless\ninsistency which, I protest, is unknown anywhere else in the world; and\nwhen Marian was not immediately accessible, and cigarettes were not\nquite satisfactory, because the entire universe was so sodden that\nmatches had to be judiciously coaxed before they would strike; and when\nif you happened to be writing a fervid letter to Rosalind Jemmett, let\nus say, the ink would not dry for ever so long:--why, it is true that\nin these circumstances you would feel a shade too like the wicked Lord\nSo-and-So of a melodrama to be comfortable.\n\nYet even in these circumstances, reason told me that the Book was the\nmain thing, that the girl would be thoroughly over the affair by\nNovember at latest, and that at the cost of a few inconsequent tears,\nshe would have meanwhile immeasurably obliged posterity. And I knew\nthat no man may ever write in perdurable fashion save by ruthlessly\nconverting his own life into \"copy,\" since of other persons' lives he\ncan, at most, reproduce but the blurred and misinterpreted by-ends, by\nreason of almost any author's deplorable lack of omniscience. Yes, the\nBook was the main thing; and yet the girl--knowingly to dip my pen into\nher heart as into an inkstand was not, at best, chivalric....\n\n\"But the Book!\" said I. \"Why, I must be quite idiotically in love to\nthink of letting that Book perish!\" And I viciously added: \"Confound\nthe pretty simpleton!\"...\n\n\n 3\n\nSo the book was builded, after all, a little by a little. Hardly an\nevening came when after leaving Marian I had not at least one excellent\nand pregnant jotting to record in my note-book. Now it would be just an\nodd turn of language, or a description of some gesture she had made, or\nof a gown she had worn that day; and now a simile or some other rather\ngood figure of speech which had popped into my mind when I was making\nlove to her.\n\nNor had I any difficulty in preserving nearly all she said to me, for\nMarian was never a chatterbox; yet her responses had, somehow, that\nlong-sought tang it wasn't in me to invent for any imaginary young\nwoman who must be, for the sake of my new novel, quite heels over head\nin love.\n\nAnd I began to see that Bettie was right, as usual. I had portrayed\nGillian Hardress pretty well in _Afield_; but by and large, I had\nalways written about women as though they were \"pterodactyls or some\nother extinct animal, which you had never seen, but had read a lot\nabout.\"\n\nAnd now, in looking over my notes, I knew, and my heart glowed to know,\nthat I was not about to repeat the error.\n\nSo the Book was builded, after all, a little by a little. And a little\nby a little the summer wore on; and in the lobby of the Main Hotel was\nhung the beautiful Spirit of the Falls poster of the Buffalo\nExposition; and we talked of Oom Paul Kr\u00fcger, and Shamrock II, and the\nNicaragua Canal, and lanky Bob Fitzsimmons, and the Boxer outrages; and\nwe read _To Have and To Hold_ and _The Cardinal's Snuff Box_, and\nthought it droll that the King of England was not going to call himself\nKing Albert, after all.\n\nAnd then came the news of how the President had been shot, \"with a\npoisoned bullet,\" and a week of contradictory bulletins from the\nMilburn House in Buffalo. And there were panicky surmises raised\neverywhere as to \"what these anarchists may do next,\" so that Maggio\nwas mobbed in Columbus, and Emma Goldman in Chicago; and Colonel\nRoosevelt was found, after days of search, on Mt. Marcy in the\nAdirondacks, and was told in the heart of a forest that to-morrow he\nwould be at the head of a nation. And the country's guidance was\nentrusted to a mere lad of forty-three, with general uneasiness as to\nwhat might come of it; and the dramatic tale of Colonel Roosevelt's\ntaking of the oath of office was in that morning's paper; and Marian\nand I were about to part.\n\n\n 4\n\n\"It will be dreadful,\" sighed she; \"for we have to stay a whole week\nlonger, and I shall come here every afternoon. And there will be only\nghosts in the woods, and I shall be very lonely.\"\n\n\"Dear,\" said I, \"is it not something to have been happy? It has been\nsuch a wonderful summer; and come what may, nothing can rob us now of\nits least golden moment. And it is only for a little.\"\n\n\"You will come back?\" said she, half-doubtingly.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"You wonderful, elfin creature, I shall undoubtedly come\nback--to your real home, and claim you there. Only I don't believe you\ndo live in Aberlin,--you probably live in some great, gnarled oak\nhereabouts; and at night its bark uncloses to set you free, and you and\nyour sisters dance out the satyrs' hearts in the moonlight. Oh, I know,\nMarian! I simply _know_ you are a dryad,--a wonderful, laughing,\nclear-eyed dryad strayed out of the golden age.\"\n\n\"What a boy it is!\" she said. \"No, I am only a really and truly girl,\ndear,--a rather frightened girl, with very little disposition to\nlaughter, just now. For you are going away--Oh, my dear, you have meant\nso much to me! The world is so different since you have come, and I am\nso happy and so miserable that--that I am afraid.\" An infinitesimal\nhandkerchief went upward to two great, sparkling eyes, and dabbed at\nthem.\n\n\"Dear!\" said I. And this remark appeared to meet the requirements of\nthe situation.\n\nThere was a silence now. We sat in the same spot where I had first\nencountered Marian Winwood. Only this was an autumnal forest that\nglowed with many gem-like hues about us; and already the damp odour of\ndecaying leaves was heavy in the air. It was like the Tosti thing\ntranslated out of marine terms into a woodland analogue. The summer was\nended; but _As the Coming of Dawn_ was practically complete.\n\nIt was not the book that I had planned, but a far greater one which was\nscarcely mine. There was no word written as yet. But for two months I\nhad viewed life through Marian Winwood's eyes; day by day, my\nhalf-formed, tentative ideas had been laid before her with elaborate\nfortuitousness, to be approved, or altered, or rejected, just as she\ndecreed; until at last they had been welded into a perfect whole that\nwas a Book, bit by bit, we had planned it, I and she; and, as I dreamed\nof it as it would be in print, my brain was fired with exultation, and\nI defied my doubt and I swore that the Book, for which I had pawned a\ncertain portion of my self-respect, was worth--and triply worth--the\nprice which had been paid.... This was in Marian's absence.\n\n\"Dear!\" said she....\n\nHer eyes were filled with a tender and unutterable confidence that\nthrilled me like physical cold. \"Marian,\" said I, simply, \"I shall\nnever come back.\"\n\nThe eyes widened a trifle, but she did not seem to comprehend.\n\n\"Have you not wondered,\" said I, \"that I have never kissed you, except\nas if you were a very holy relic or a cousin or something of that\nsort?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered. Her voice was quite emotionless.\n\n\"And yet--yet--\" I sprang to my feet. \"Dear God, how I have longed!\nYesterday, only yesterday, as I read to you from the verses I had made\nto other women, those women that are colourless shadows by the side of\nyour vivid beauty,--and you listened wonderingly and said the proper\nthings and then lapsed into dainty boredom,--_how_ I longed to take you\nin my arms, and to quicken your calm blood a little with another sort\nof kissing. You knew--you must have known! Last night, for instance--\"\n\n\"Last night,\" she said, very simply, \"I thought--And I hoped you\nwould.\"\n\n\"What a confession for a nicely brought up girl! Well! I didn't. And\nafterward, all night, I tossed in sick, fevered dreams of you. I am mad\nfor love of you. And so, once in a while I kiss your hand. Dear God,\nyour hand!\" My voice quavered, effectively.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she; \"still, I remember--\"\n\n\"I have struggled; and I have conquered this madness,--for a madness it\nis. We can laugh together and be excellent friends; and we can never,\nnever be anything more. Well! we have laughed, have we not, dear, a\nwhole summer through? Now comes the ending. Ah, I have seen you\npuzzling over my meaning before this. You never understood me\nthoroughly; but it is always safe to laugh.\"\n\nShe smiled; and I remember now it was rather as Mona Lisa smiles.\n\n\"For we can laugh together,--that is all. We are not mates. You were\nborn to be the wife of a strong man and the mother of his sturdy\nchildren; and you and your sort will inherit the earth and make the\nlaws for us weaklings who dream and scribble and paint. We are not\nmates. But you have been very kind to me, Marian dear. So I thank you\nand say good-bye; and I pray that I may never see you after to-day.\"\n\nThere was a sub-tang of veracity in my deprecation of an unasked-for\nartistic temperament; the thing is very often a nuisance, and was just\nthen a barrier which I perceived plainly; and with equal plainness I\nperceived the pettier motives that now caused me to point it out as a\nbarrier to Marian. My lips curled half in mockery of myself, as I\nframed the bitter smile I felt the situation demanded; but I was fired\nwith the part I was playing; and half-belief had crept into my mind\nthat Marian Winwood was created, chiefly, for the purpose which she had\nalready served.\n\nI regarded her, in fine, as through the eyes of future readers of my\nbiography. She would represent an episode in my life, as others do in\nthat of Byron or of Goethe. I pitied her sincerely; and, under all,\nwhat moralists would call my lower nature, held in leash for two months\npast, chuckled, and grinned, and leaped, at the thought of a holiday.\n\nShe rose to her feet. \"Good-bye,\" said she.\n\n\"You--you understand, dear?\" I queried, tenderly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered; \"I understand--not what you have just told me, for\nin that, of course, you have lied. That Jemmett girl and her money is\nat the bottom of it all, of course. You didn't want to lose her, and\nstill you wanted to play with me. So you were pulled two ways, poor\ndear.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, if that is what you think of me--!\"\n\n\"You see, you are not an uncommon type,--a type not strong enough to\nlive life healthily, just strong enough to dabble in life, to trifle\nwith emotions, to experiment with other people's lives. Indeed, I am\nnot angry, dear; I am only--sorry; for you have played with me very\nnicely indeed, and very boyishly, and the summer has been very happy.\"\n\n\n 5\n\nI returned to Lichfield and wrote _As the Coming of Dawn_.\n\nI spent six months in this. My work at first was mere copying of the\nbook that already existed in my brain; but when it was transcribed\ntherefrom, I wrote and rewrote, shifted and polished and adorned until\nit seemed I would never have done; and indeed I was not anxious to have\ndone with any labour so delightful.\n\nParticularly did I rejoice in the character for which Marian Winwood\nhad posed. Last summer's note-book here came into play; and now, for\nonce, my heroine was in no need of either shoving or prompting. She did\nthings of her own accord, and I was merely her scribe...\n\nI would vain-gloriously protest, just to myself, that the love scenes\nin this story were the most exquisite and, with all that, the most\ngenuine love scenes I knew of anywhere. \"By God!\" I would occasionally\nsay with Thackeray; \"I _am_ a genius!\"\n\nBesides, the story of the book, I knew, was novel and astutely wrought;\nits progress caught at once and teased your interest always, so that\nhaving begun it, most people would read to the end, if only to discover\n\"how it all came out.\" I knew the book, in fine, could hardly fail to\nplease and interest a number of people by reason of its plot alone.\n\nI ought to have been content with this. But I had somehow contracted an\ninsane notion that a novel is the more enjoyable when it is adroitly\nwritten. In point of fact, of course, no man who writes with care is\never read with pleasure; you may toil through a page or two perhaps,\nbut presently you are noting how precisely every word is fitted to the\nthought, and later you are noting nothing else. You are insensibly\nbeguiled into a fidgety-footed analysis of every clause, which fatigues\nin the outcome, and by the tenth page you are yawning.\n\nBut I did not comprehend this then. And so I fashioned my apt phrases,\nand weighed my synonyms, and echoed this or that vowel very skilfully,\nI thought, and alliterated my consonants with discretion. In fine, I\ndid not overlook the most meticulous device of the stylist; and I\nenjoyed it. It was a sort of game; and they taught me at least, those\nsix delightful months, that a man writes admirable prose not at all for\nthe sake of having it read, but for the more sensible reason that he\nenjoys playing solitaire.\n\nI led a hermit's life that winter; and I enjoyed that too. Night, after\nall, is the one time for writing, particularly when you are inane\nenough to hanker after perfected speech, and so misguided as to be the\nslave of the \"right word.\" You sit alone in a bright, comfortable room;\nthe clock ticks companionably; there is no other sound in the world\nexcept the constant scratching of your pen, and the occasional far-off\npuffing of a freight-train coming into Lichfield; there is snow\noutside, but before your eyes someone, that is not you exactly,\narranges and redrills the scrawls which will bring back the sweet and\nlanguid summer and remarshal all its pleasant trivialities for anyone\nthat chooses to read through the printed page, although he read two\ncenturies hence, in Nova Zembla....\n\nThen you dip into an Unabridged, and change every word that has been\nwritten, for a better one, and do it leisurely, rolling in the mouth,\nas it were, the flavour of every possible synonym, before decision.\nThen you reread, with a corrective pen in hand the while, and you\nventure upon the whole to agree with M\u00e9rim\u00e9e that it is preferable to\nwrite one's own books, since those of others are not, after all,\nparticularly worth reading in comparison.\n\nAnd by this time the windows are pale blue, like the blue of a dying\nflame, and you peep out and see the sparrows moving like rather poorly\nmade mechanical toys about the middle of the deserted street, where\nthere is neither light nor shade. The colour of everything is perfectly\ndiscernible, but there is no lustre in the world as yet, though yonder\nthe bloat sun is already visible in the blue and red east, which is\nlike a cosmic bruise; and upon a sudden you find it just possible to\nstay awake long enough to get safely into bed....\n\n\n 6\n\nThus I dandled the child of my brain for a long while, and arrayed it\nin beautiful and curious garments, adorning each beloved notion with\nfar-sought words that had a taste in the mouth, and would one day lend\nan aroma to the printed page; and I rejoiced shamelessly in that which\nI had done. Then it befell that I went forth and sought the luxury of a\nTurkish bath, and in the morning, after a rub-down and an ammonia\ncocktail, awoke to the fact that the world had been going on much as\nusual, that winter.\n\nYoung Colonel Roosevelt seemed not to have wrecked civilization, after\nall, according to the morning _Courier-Herald_, despite that Democratic\npaper's colorful prophecies last autumn in the vein of Jeremiah. To the\ncontrary, Major-General McArthur was testifying before the Senate as to\nthe abysmal unfitness of the Filipinos for self-government; the Women's\nClubs were holding a convention in Los Angeles; there had been terrible\nhailstorms this year to induce the annual ruining of the peach-crop,\nand the submarine Fulton had exploded; the California Limited had been\nderailed in Iowa, and in Memphis there was some sort of celebration in\nhonor of Admiral Schley; and the Boer War seemed over; and Mr.\nHavemeyer also was before the Senate, to whom he was making it clear\nthat his companies were in no wise responsible for sugar having reached\nthe unprecedentedly high price of four and a half cents a pound.\n\nThe world, in short, in spite of my six months' retiring therefrom,\nseemed to be getting on pleasantly enough, as I turned from the paper\nto face the six months' accumulation of mail.\n\n\n 7\n\nA few weeks later, I sent for Mr. George Bulmer, and informed him of\nhis avuncular connection with a genius; and waved certain typewritten\npages to establish his title.\n\nSubsequently I read aloud divers portions of _As the Coming of Dawn_,\nand Mr. Bulmer sipped Chianti, and listened.\n\n\"Look here!\" he said, suddenly; \"have you seen _The Imperial\nVotaress?_\"\n\nI frowned. It is always annoying to be interrupted in the middle of a\nparticularly well-balanced sentence. \"Don't know the lady,\" said I.\n\n\"She is advertised on half the posters in town,\" said Mr. Bulmer. \"And\nit is the book of the year. And it is your book.\"\n\nAt this moment I laid down my manuscript. '\"I _beg_ your pardon?\" said\nI.\n\n\"Your book!\" Uncle George repeated firmly; \"and scarcely a hair's\ndifference between them, except in the names.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" I observed, in a careful voice. \"Who wrote it?\"\n\n\"Some female woman out west,\" said Mr. Bulmer. \"She's a George\nSomething-or-other when she publishes, of course, like all those\nauthorines when they want to say about mankind at large what less\ngifted women only dare say about their sisters-in-law. I wish to heaven\nthey would pick out some other Christian name when they want to cut up\nlike pagans. Anyhow, I saw her real name somewhere, and I remember it\nbegan with an S--Why, to be sure! it's Marian Winwood.\"\n\n\"Amaimon sounds well,\" I observed; \"Lucifer, well; Larbason, well; yet\nthey are devils' additions, the names of fiends: but--Marian Winwood!\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" he remonstrated. \"Why, she wrote _A Bright Particular Star_,\nyou know, and _The Acolytes_, and lots of others.\"\n\nThe author of _As the Coming of Dawn_ swallowed a whole glass of\nChianti at a gulp.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, slowly, \"I cannot, in my rather peculiar position,\nrun the risk of being charged with plagiarism--by a Chinese-eyed mental\nsneak-thief....\"\n\nThereupon I threw the manuscript into the open fire, which my\npreference for the picturesque rendered necessary, even in May.\n\n\"Oh, look here!\" my uncle cried, and caught up the papers. \"It is\ninfernally good, you know! Can't you--can't you fix it,--and--er--\nchange it a bit? Typewriting is so expensive these days that it seems a\npity to waste all this.\"\n\nI took the manuscript and replaced it firmly among the embers. \"As you\njustly observe,\" said I, \"it is infernally good. It is probably a deal\nbetter than anything else I shall ever write.\"\n\n\"Why, then--\" said Uncle George.\n\n\"Why, then,\" said I, \"the only thing that remains to do is to read _The\nImperial Votaress._\"\n\n\n 8\n\nAnd I read it with an augmenting irritation. Here was my great and\ncomely idea transmuted by \"George Glock\"--which was the woman's foolish\npen-name,--into a rather clever melodrama, and set forth anyhow, in a\nhit or miss style that fairly made me squirm. I would cheerfully have\nstrangled Marian Winwood just then, and not upon the count of larceny,\nbut of butchery.\n\n\"And to cap it all, she has assigned her hero every pretty speech I\never made to her! I honestly believe the rogue took shorthand jottings\non her cuffs. 'There is a land where lovers may meet face to face, and\nheart to heart, and mouth to mouth'--why, that's the note I wrote her\non the day she wasn't feeling well!\"\n\nPresently, however, I began to laugh, and presently sitting there\nalone, I began to applaud as if I were witnessing a play that took my\nfancy.\n\n\"Oh, the adorable jade!\" I said; and then: \"George Glock, forsooth!\n_George Dandin, tu l' as voulu._\"\n\n\n 9\n\nNaturally I put the entire affair into a short story. And--though even\nto myself it seems incredible,--Miss Winwood wrote me within three days\nof the tale's appearance, a very indignant letter.\n\nFor she was furious, to the last exclamation point and underlining,\nabout my little magazine tale.... \"Why don't you stop writing, and try\nplumbing or butchering or traveling for scented soap? _You can't\nwrite!_ If you had the light of creation you wouldn't be using my\nmaterial\"....\n\n--Which caused me to reflect forlornly that I had wasted a great deal\nof correct behavior upon Marian, since any of the more intimately\namorous advances which I might have made, and had scrupulously\nrefrained from making, would very probably have been regarded as raw\n\"material,\" to be developed rather than shocked by....\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\n_He Spends an Afternoon in Arden_\n\n\nI had, in a general way, intended to marry Rosalind Jemmett so soon as\nI had completed _As the Coming of Dawn_; but in the fervour of writing\nthat unfortunate volume, I had at first put off a little, and then a\nlittle longer, the answering of her last letter, because I was\ninterested just then in writing well and not particularly interested in\nanything else; and I had finally approximated to forgetfulness of the\nyoung lady's existence.\n\nNow, however, my thoughts harked back to her; and I found, upon\ninquiry, that Rosalind had spent all of May and a good half of April in\nLichfield, in the same town with myself, and was now engaged to Alfred\nChaytor,--an estimable person, but popularly known as \"Sissy\" Chaytor.\n\n\n 2\n\nAnd this gave an additional whet to my intentions. So I called upon the\ngirl, and she, to my chagrin, received me with an air of having danced\nwith me some five or six times the night before; our conversation was\nat first trivial and, on her part, dishearteningly cordial; and, in\nfine, she completely baffled me by not appearing to expect any least\nexplanation of my discourteous neglect. This, look you, when I had been\nat pains to prepare a perfectly convincing one.\n\nIt must be conceded I completely lost my temper; shortly afterward\nneither of us was speaking with excessive forethought; and each of us\nlanguidly advanced a variety of observations which were more dexterous\nthan truthful. But I followed the intractable heiress to the Moncrieffs\nthat spring, in spite of this rebuff, being insufferably provoked by\nher unshakable assumptions of my friendship and of nothing more.\n\n\n 3\n\nIt was perhaps a week later she told me: \"This, beyond any reasonable\ndoubt, is the Forest of Arden.\"\n\n\"But where Rosalind is is always Arden,\" I said, politely. Yet I made a\nmental reservation as to a glimpse of the golf-links, which this\nparticular nook of the forest afforded, and of a red-headed caddy in\nsearch of a lost ball.\n\nBut beyond these things the sun was dying out in a riot of colour, and\nits level rays fell kindlily upon the gaunt pines that were thick about\nus two, converting them into endless aisles of vaporous gold.\n\nThere was primeval peace about; an evening wind stirred lazily above,\nand the leaves whispered drowsily to one another over the waters of\nwhat my companion said was a \"brawling loch,\" though I had previously\nheard it reviled as a particularly treacherous and vexatious hazard.\nAltogether, I had little doubt that we had reached, in any event, the\noutskirts of Arden.\n\n\"And now,\" quoth she, seating herself on a fallen log, \"what would you\ndo if I were your very, very Rosalind?\"\n\n\"Don't!\" I cried in horror. \"It wouldn't be proper! For as a decent\nself-respecting heroine, you would owe it to Orlando not to listen.\"\n\n\"H'umph!\" said Rosalind. The exclamation does not look impressive,\nwritten out; but, spoken, it placed Orlando in his proper niche.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said I, and stretched myself at her feet, full\nlength,--which is supposed to be a picturesque attitude,--\"why quarrel\nover a name? It ought to be Gamelyn, anyhow; and, moreover, by the\nkindness of fate, Orlando is golfing.\"\n\nRosalind frowned, dubiously.\n\n\"But golf is a very ancient game,\" I reassured her. Then I bit a\npine-needle in two and sighed. \"Foolish fellow, when he might be--\"\n\n\"Admiring the beauties of nature,\" she suggested.\n\nJust then an impudent breeze lifted a tendril of honey-coloured hair\nand toyed with it, over a low, white brow,--and I noted that Rosalind's\nhair had a curious coppery glow at the roots, a nameless colour that I\nhave never observed anywhere else....\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"of nature.\"\n\n\"Then,\" queried she, after a pause, \"who are you? And what do you in\nthis forest?\"\n\n\"You see,\" I explained, \"there were conceivably other men in Arden--\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" she sighed, with exemplary resignation.\n\n\"--For you were,\" I reminded her, \"universally admired at your uncle's\ncourt,--and equally so in the forest. And while Alfred--or, strictly\nspeaking, Gamelyn, or, if you prefer it, Orlando,--is the great love of\nyour life, still--\"\n\n\"Men are so foolish!\" said Rosalind, irrelevantly.\n\n\"--it did not prevent you--\"\n\n\"Me!\" cried she, indignant.\n\n\"You had such a tender heart,\" I suggested, \"and suffering was\nabhorrent to your gentle nature.\"\n\n\"I don't like cynicism, sir,\" said she; \"and inasmuch as tobacco is not\nyet discovered--\"\n\n\"It is clearly impossible that I am smoking,\" I finished; \"quite true.\"\n\n\"I don't like cheap wit, either,\" said Rosalind. \"You,\" she went on,\nwith no apparent connection, \"are a forester, with a good cross-bow and\nan unrequited attachment,--say, for me. You groan and hang verses and\nthings about on the trees.\"\n\n\"But I don't write verses--any longer,\" I amended. \"Still how would\nthis do,--for an oak, say,--\n\n\"I found a lovely centre-piece\nUpon the supper-table,\nBut when I looked at it again\nI saw I wasn't able,\nAnd so I took my mother home\nAnd locked her in the stable.\"\n\nShe considered that the plot of this epic was not sufficiently\ninevitable. It hadn't, she lamented, a quite logical ending; and the\nplot of it, in fine, was not, somehow, convincing.\n\n\"Well, in any event,\" I optimistically reflected, \"I am a nickel in. If\nyour dicta had emanated from a person in Peoria or Seattle, who hadn't\nbothered to read my masterpiece, they would have sounded exactly the\nsame, and the clipping-bureau would have charged me five cents.\nMaybe I can't write verses, then. But I am quite sure I can groan.\" And\nI did so.\n\n\"It sounds rather like a fog-horn,\" said Rosalind, still in the\ncritic's vein; \"but I suppose it is the proper thing. Now,\" she\ncontinued, and quite visibly brightening, \"you can pretend to have an\nunrequited attachment for me.\"\n\n\"But I can't--\" I decisively said.\n\n\"Can't,\" she echoed. It has not been mentioned previously that Rosalind\nwas pretty. She was especially so just now, in pouting. And, therefore,\n\"--pretend,\" I added.\n\nShe preserved a discreet silence.\n\n\"Nor,\" I continued, with firmness, \"am I a shambling, nameless,\nunshaven denizen of Arden, who hasn't anything to do except to carry a\nspear and fall over it occasionally. I will no longer conceal the\nsecret of my identity. I am Jaques.\"\n\n\"You can't be Jaques,\" she dissented; \"you are too stout.\"\n\n\"I am well-built,\" I admitted, modestly; \"as in an elder case, sighing\nand grief have blown me up like a bladder; yet proper pride, if nothing\nelse, demands that my name should appear on the programme.\"\n\n\"But would Jaques be the sort of person who'd--?\"\n\n\"Who wouldn't be?\" I asked, with appropriate ardour. \"No, depend upon\nit, Jaques was not any more impervious to temptation than the rest of\nus; and, indeed, in the French version, as you will find, he eventually\nmarried Celia.\"\n\n\"Minx!\" said she; and it seemed to me quite possible that she referred\nto Celia Reindan, and my heart glowed.\n\n\"And how,\" queried Rosalind, presently, \"came you to the Forest of\nArden, good Jaques?\"\n\nI groaned once more. \"It was a girl,\" I darkly said.\n\n\"Of course,\" assented Rosalind, beaming as to the eyes. Then she went\non, and more sympathetically: \"Now, Jaques, you can tell me the whole\nstory.\"\n\n\"Is it necessary?\" I asked.\n\n\"Surely,\" said she, with sudden interest in the structure of\npine-cones; \"since for a long while I have wanted to know all about\nJaques. You see Mr. Shakespeare is a bit hazy about him.\"\n\n\"_So_!\" I thought, triumphantly.\n\nAnd aloud, \"It is an old story,\" I warned her, \"perhaps the oldest of\nall old stories. It is the story of a man and a girl. It began with a\nchance meeting and developed into a packet of old letters, which is the\nusual ending of this story.\"\n\nRosalind's brows protested.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" I conceded, \"it culminates in matrimony; but the ending is\nnot necessarily tragic.\"\n\nI dodged exactly in time; and the pine-cone splashed into the hazard.\n\n\"It happened,\" I continued, \"that, on account of the man's health, they\nwere separated for a whole year's time before--before things had\nprogressed to any extent. When they did progress, it was largely by\nletters. That is why this story ended in such a large package.\n\n\"Letters,\" Rosalind confided, to one of the pines, \"are so\nunsatisfactory. They mean so little.\"\n\n\"To the man,\" I said, firmly, \"they meant a great deal. They brought\nhim everything that he most wished for,--comprehension, sympathy, and,\nat last, comfort and strength when they were sore needed. So the man,\nwho was at first but half in earnest, announced to himself that he had\nmade a discovery. 'I have found,' said he, 'the great white love which\npoets have dreamed of. I love this woman greatly, and she, I think,\nloves me. God has made us for each other, and by the aid of her love I\nwill be pure and clean and worthy even of her.' You have doubtless\ndiscovered by this stage in my narrative,\" I added, as in parenthesis,\n\"that the man was a fool.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" said Rosalind.\n\n\"Oh, he discovered it himself in due time--but not until after he had\nwritten a book about her. _As the Coming of Dawn_ the title was to have\nbeen. It was--oh, just about her. It tried to tell how greatly he loved\nher. It tried--well, it failed of course, because it isn't within the\npower of any writer to express what the man felt for that girl. Why,\nhis love was so great--to him, poor fool!--that it made him at times\nforget the girl herself, apparently. He didn't want to write her\ntrivial letters. He just wanted to write that great book in her honour,\nwhich would _make_ her understand, even against her will, and then to\ndie, if need be, as Geoffrey Rudel did. For that was the one thing\nwhich counted--to make her understand--\" I paused, and anyone could see\nthat I was greatly moved. In fact, I was believing every word of it by\nthis time.\n\n\"Oh, but who wants a man to _die_ for her?\" wailed Rosalind.\n\n\"It is quite true that one infinitely prefers to see him make a fool of\nhimself. So the man discovered when he came again to bring his foolish\nbook to her,--the book that was to make her understand. And so he\nburned it--in a certain June. For the girl had merely liked him, and\nhad been amused by him. So she had added him to her collection of men,\n--quite a large one, by the way,--and was, I believe, a little proud of\nhim. It was, she said, rather a rare variety, and much prized by\ncollectors.\"\n\n\"And how was _she_ to know?\" said Rosalind; and then, remorsefully:\n\"Was it a very horrid girl?\"\n\n\"It was not exactly repulsive,\" said I, as dreamily, and looking up\ninto the sky.\n\nThere was a pause. Then someone in the distance--a forester, probably,\n--called \"Fore!\" and Rosalind awoke from her reverie.\n\n\"Then--?\" said she.\n\n\"Then came the customary Orlando--oh, well! Alfred, if you like. The\nname isn't altogether inappropriate, for he does encounter existence\nwith much the same abandon which I have previously noticed in a muffin.\nFor the rest, he was a nicely washed fellow, with a sufficiency of the\nmediaeval equivalents for bonds and rubber-tired buggies and country\nplaces. Oh, yes! I forgot to say that the man was poor,--also that the\ngirl had a great deal of common-sense and no less than three longheaded\naunts. And so the girl talked to the man in a common-sense fashion--and\nafter that she was never at home.\"\n\n\"Never?\" said Rosalind.\n\n\"Only that time they talked about the weather,\" said I. \"So the man\nfell out of bed just about then, and woke up and came to his sober\nsenses.\"\n\n\"He did it very easily,\" said Rosalind, almost as if in resentment.\n\n\"The novelty of the process attracted him,\" I pleaded. \"So he said--in\na perfectly sensible way--that he had known all along it was only a\ngame they were playing,--a game in which there were no stakes. That was\na lie. He had put his whole soul into the game, playing as he knew for\nhis life's happiness; and the verses, had they been worthy of the love\nwhich caused them to be written, would have been among the great songs\nof the world. But while the man knew at last that he had been a fool,\nhe was swayed by a man-like reluctance against admitting it. So he\nlaughed--and lied--and broke away, hurt, but still laughing.\"\n\n\"You hadn't mentioned any verses before,\" said Rosalind.\n\n\"I told you he was a fool,\" said I. \"And, after all, that is the entire\nstory.\"\n\nThen I spent several minutes in wondering what would happen next.\nDuring this time I lost none of my interest in the sky. I believed\neverything I had said: my emotions would have done credit to a Romeo or\nan Amadis.\n\n\"The first time that the girl was not at home,\" Rosalind observed,\nimpersonally, \"the man had on a tan coat and a brown derby. He put on\nhis gloves as he walked down the street. His shoulders were the most\nindignant--and hurt things she had ever seen. Then the girl wrote to\nhim,--a strangely sincere letter,--and tore it up.\"\n\n\"Historical research,\" I murmured, \"surely affords no warrant for such\nattire among the rural denizens of tranquil Arden.\"\n\n\"You see,\" continued Rosalind, oblivious to interruption, \"I know all\nabout the girl,--which is more than you do.\"\n\n\"That,\" I conceded, \"is disastrously probable.\"\n\n\"When she realised that she was to see the man again--_Did_ you ever\nfeel as if something had lifted you suddenly hundreds of feet above\nrainy days and cold mutton for luncheon, and the possibility of other\ngirls' wearing black evening dresses, when you wanted yours to be the\nonly one in the room? Well, that is the way she felt at first, when she\nread his note. At first, she realised nothing beyond the fact that he\nwas nearing her, and that she would presently see him. She didn't even\nplan what she would wear, or what she would say to him. In an\nindefinite way, she was happier than she had ever been before--or has\nbeen since--until the doubts and fears and knowledge that give children\nand fools a wide berth came to her,--and _then_ she saw it all against\nher will, and thought it all out, and came to a conclusion.\"\n\nI sat up. There was really nothing of interest occurring overhead.\n\n\"They had played at loving--lightly, it is true, but they had gone so\nfar in their letter writing that they could not go backward,--only\nforward, or not at all. She had known all along that the man was but\nhalf in earnest--believe me, a girl always knows that, even though she\nmay not admit it to herself,--and she had known that a love affair\nmeant to him material for a sonnet or so, and a well-turned letter or\ntwo, and nothing more. For he was the kind of man that never quite\ngrows up. He was coming to her, pleased, interested, and a little\neager--in love with the idea of loving her,--willing to meet her\nhalf-way, and very willing to follow her the rest of the way--if she\ncould draw him. And what was she to do? Could she accept his gracefully\ninsulting semblance of a love she knew he did not feel? Could they see\neach other a dozen times, swearing not to mention the possibility of\nloving,--so that she might have a chance to reimpress him with her\nblondined hair--it _is_ touched up, you know--and small talk? And--and\n_besides_--\"\n\n\"It is the duty of every young woman to consider what she owes to her\nfamily,\" said I, absentmindedly. Rosalind Jemmett's family consists of\nthree aunts, and the chief of these is Aunt Marcia, who lives in\nLichfield. Aunt Marcia is a portly, acidulous and discomposing person,\nwith eyes like shoe-buttons and a Savonarolan nose. She is also a\nwell-advertised philanthropist, speaks neatly from the platform, and\nhas wide experience as a patroness, and extreme views as to\nineligibles.\n\nRosalind flushed somewhat. \"And so,\" said she, \"the girl exercised her\ncommon-sense, and was nervous, and said foolish things about new plays,\nand the probability of rain--to keep from saying still more foolish\nthings about herself; and refused to talk personalities; and let him\ngo, with the knowledge that he would not come back. Then she went to\nher room, and had a good cry. Now,\" she added, after a pause, \"you\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"I do not,\" I said, very firmly, \"understand a lot of things.\"\n\n\"Yet a woman would,\" she murmured.\n\nThis being a statement I was not prepared to contest, I waved it aside.\n\"And so,\" said I, \"they laughed; and agreed it was a boy-and-girl\naffair; and were friends.\"\n\n\"It was the best thing--\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" I assented,--\"for Orlando.\"\n\n\"--and it was the most sensible thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, eminently!\"\n\nThis seemed to exhaust the subject, and I lay down once more among the\npine-needles.\n\n\"And that,\" said Rosalind, \"was the reason Jaques came to Arden?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\n\"And found it--?\"\n\n\"Shall we say--Hades?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she murmured, scandalised.\n\n\"It happened,\" I continued, \"that he was cursed with a good memory. And\nthe zest was gone from his little successes and failures, now there was\nno one to share them; and nothing seemed to matter very much. Oh, he\nreally was the sort of man that never grows up! And it was dreary to\nlive among memories of the past, and his life was now somewhat\nperturbed by disapproval of his own folly and by hunger for a woman who\nwas out of his reach.\"\n\n\"And Rosalind--I mean the girl--?\"\n\n\"She married Orlando--or Gamelyn, or Alfred, or Athelstane, or\nEthelred, or somebody,--and, whoever it was, they lived happily ever\nafterward,\" I said, morosely.\n\nRosalind pondered over this d\u00e9nouement for a moment.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said she, \"I think--\"\n\n\"It's a rather dangerous practice,\" I warned her.\n\nRosalind sighed, wearily; but in her cheek at about this time occurred\na dimple.\n\n\"--I think that Rosalind must have thought the play\nvery badly named.\"\n\n\"_As You Like It_?\" I queried, obtusely.\n\n\"Yes--since it wasn't, for her.\"\n\nIt is unwholesome to lie on the ground after sunset.\n\n\n 4\n\n\"I had rather a scene with Alfred yesterday morning. He said you drank,\nand gambled, and were always running after--people, and weren't in\nfine, a desirable person for me to know. He insinuated, in fact, that\nyou were a villain of the very deepest and non-crocking dye. He told me\nof instances. His performance would have done credit to Ananias. I was\n_mad_! So I gave him his old ring back, and told him things I can't\ntell _you_,--no, not just yet, dear. He is rather like a muffin, isn't\nhe?\" she said, with the lightest possible little laugh--\"particularly\nlike one that isn't quite done.\"\n\n\"Oh, Rosalind,\" I babbled, \"I mean to prove that you were right. And I\n_will_ prove it, too!\"\n\nAnd indeed I meant all that I said--just then.\n\nRosalind said: \"Oh, Jaques, Jaques! what a child you are!\"\n\n\n\n\n19.\n\n_He Plays the Improvident Fool_\n\n\nNow was I come near to the summit of my desires, and advantageously\nbetrothed to a girl with whom I was, in any event, almost in love; but\nI presently ascertained, to my dismay, that sophisticated, \"proper\"\nlittle Rosalind was thoroughly in love with me, and always in the back\nof my mind this knowledge worried me.\n\nImprimis, she persisted in calling me Jaques, which was uncomfortably\nreminiscent of that time wherein I was called Jack. Yet my objection to\nthis silly nickname was a mischancy matter to explain. There was no way\nof telling her that I disliked anything which reminded me of Gillian\nHardress, without telling more about Gillian than would be pleasant to\ntell. So Rosalind went on calling me Jaques; and I was compelled to put\nup with a trivial and unpremeditated, but for all that a daily,\nannoyance; and I fretted under it.\n\nItem, she insisted on presenting me with all sorts of expensive\nknick-knacks, and being childishly grieved when I remonstrated.\n\n\"But I have the money,\" Rosalind would say, \"and you haven't. So why\nshouldn't I? And besides, it's really only selfishness on my part,\nbecause I like doing things for you, and _if_ you liked doing things\nfor me, Jaques, you'd understand.\"\n\nSo I would eventually have to swear that I did like \"doing things\" for\nher; and it followed--somehow--that in consequence she had a perfect\nright to give me anything she wanted to.\n\nAnd this too fretted me, mildly, all the summer I spent at Birnam Beach\nwith Rosalind and with the opulent friends of Rosalind's aunt from St.\nLouis.... They were a queer lot. They all looked so unspeakably new;\ntheir clothes were spick and span, and as expensive as possible, but\nthat was not it; even in their bathing suits these middle-aged\npeople--they were mostly middle-aged--seemed to have been very recently\nfinished, like animated waxworks of middle-aged people just come from\nthe factory. And they spent money in a continuous careless way that\nfrightened me.\n\nBut I was on my very best, most dignified behavior; and when Aunt Lora\npresented me as \"one of the Lichfield Townsends, you know,\" these\nbrewers and breweresses appeared to be properly impressed. One of\nthem--actually--\"supposed that I had a coat-of-arms\"; which in\nLichfield would be equivalent to \"supposing\" that a gentleman possessed\na pair of trousers. But they were really very thoughtful about never\nletting me pay for anything; in this regard there seemed afoot a sort\nof friendly conspiracy.\n\nSo the summer passed pleasantly enough; and we bathed, and held hands\nin the moonlight, and danced at the Casino, and rode the\nmerry-go-round, and played ping-pong, and read _Dorothy Vernon of\nHaddon Hall_,--which was much better, I told everybody, than that\nidiotic George Clock book, _The Imperial Votaress_. And we drank\ninterminable suissesses, and it was all very pleasant.\n\nYet always in the rear of my mind was stirring restively the instinct\nto get back to my writing; and these sedately frolicsome benevolent\npeople--even Rosalind--plainly thought that \"writing things\" was just\nthe unimportant foible of an otherwise fine young fellow.\n\n\n 2\n\nAnd in September Rosalind came to visit her Aunt Marcia in Lichfield,\nto get clothes and all other matters ready for our wedding in November;\nand Lichfield, as always, made much of Rosalind, and she had the honor\nof \"leading\" the first Lichfield German with Colonel Rudolph Musgrave.\nMy partner at that dance was the Marquise d'Arlanges....\n\nI was seeing a deal of the Marquise d'Arlanges. She was Stella's only\nsister, as you may remember, and was that autumn paying a perfunctory\nvisit to her parents--the second since her marriage.\n\nI shall not expatiate, however, concerning Madame la Marquise. You have\ndoubtless heard of her. For Lizzie has not, even yet, found a time\nwherein to be idle; she has been busied since the hour of her birth in\nacquiring first, plain publicity, and then social power, and every\nother amenity of life in turn. I had not the least doubt even then of\nher ending where she is now....\n\nShe was at this time still well upon the preferable side o! thirty, and\nhad no weaknesses save a liking for gossip, cigarettes, and admiration.\nLizzie was never the woman to marry a Peter Blagden. Once Stella was\nsettled, Lizzie Musgrave had sailed for Europe, and eventually had\narrived at Monaco with an apologetic mother, several letters of\nintroduction, and a Scotch terrier; and had established herself at the\nH\u00f4tel de la Paix, to look over the \"available\" supply of noblemen in\nreduced circumstances. Before the end of a month Miss Musgrave had\nreached a decision, had purchased her Marquis, much as she would have\ndone any other trifle that took her fancy, and had shipped her mother\nback to America. Lizzie retained the terrier, however, as she was\nhonestly attached to it.\n\nHer marriage had been happy, and she found her husband on further\nacquaintance, as she told me, a mild-mannered and eminently suitable\nperson, who was unaccountably addicted to playing dominoes, and who\nspent a great deal of money, and dined with her occasionally. In a\nsentence, the marquise was handsome, \"had a tongue in her head,\" and,\nto utilise yet another ancient phrase, was as hard as nails.\n\nAnd yet there was a family resemblance. Indeed, in voice and feature\nshe was strangely like an older Stella; and always I was cheating\nmyself into a half-belief that this woman I was talking with was\nStella; and Lizzie would at least enable me to forget, for a whole\nhalf-hour sometimes, that Stella was dead....\n\n       *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"I must thank you,\" I said, one afternoon, when I arose to go, \"for a\nmost pleasant dream of--what we'll call the Heart's Desire. I suppose I\nhave been rather stupid, Lizzie; and I apologise for it; but people are\nnever exceedingly hilarious in dreams, you know.\"\n\nShe said, very gently: \"I understand. For I loved Stella too. And that\nis why the room is never really lighted when you come. Oh, you stupid\nman, how could I have _helped_ knowing it--that all the love you have\nmade to me was because you have been playing I was Stella? That\nknowledge has preserved me, more than once, my child, from succumbing\nto your illicit advances in this dead Lichfield.\"\n\nAnd I was really astonished, for she was not by ordinary the sort of\nwoman who consents to be a makeshift.\n\nI said as much, \"And it _has_ been a comfort, Lizzie, because she\ndoesn't come as often now, for some reason--\"\n\n\"Why--what do you mean?\"\n\nThe room was very dark, lit only by the steady, comfortable glow of a\nsoft-coal fire. For it was a little after sunset, and outside,\ncarriages were already rumbling down Regis Avenue, and people were\nreturning from the afternoon drive. I could not see anything\ndistinctly, excepting my own hands, which were like gold in the\nfirelight; and so I told her all about _The Indulgences of Ole-Luk-Ole_.\n\n\"She came, that first time, over the crest of a tiny upland that lay in\nsome great forest,--Brocheliaunde, I think. I knew it must be autumn,\nfor the grass was brown and every leaf upon the trees was brown. And\nshe too was all in brown, and her big hat, too, was of brown felt, and\nabout it curled a long ostrich feather dyed brown; and my first\nthought, as I now remember, was how in the dickens could any mediaeval\nlady have come by such a garb, for I knew, somehow, that this was a\nwoman of the Middle Ages.\n\n\"Only her features were those of Stella, and the eyes of this woman\nwere filled with an unutterable happiness and fear, as she came toward\nme,--just as the haunting eyes of Stella were upon the night she\nmarried Peter Blagden, and I babbled nonsense to the moon.\n\n\"'Oh, I have wanted you,--I have wanted you!' she said; and afterward,\nunarithmeticably dimpling, just as she used to do, you may remember:\n_'Depardieux,_ messire! have you then forgotten that upon this forenoon\nwe hunt the great boar?\"\n\n\"'Stella!' I said, 'O dear, dear Stella! what does it mean?'\n\n\"'You silly! it means, of course, that Ole-Luk-Oie is kind, and has put\nus both into the glaze of the mustard-jar--only I wonder which one we\nhave gotten into?' Stella said. 'Don't you remember them, dear--the\nblue mustard-jar and the red one your Mammy had that summer at the\nGreen Chalybeate, with men on them hunting a boar?'\n\n\"'They stood, one on each corner of the mantelpiece,' I said; 'and in\nthe blue one she kept matches, and in the other--'\n\n\"'She kept buttons in the red one,' said Stella,--'big, shiny white\nbuttons, with four holes in them, that had come off your underclothes,\nand were to be sewed on again. One day you swallowed one of 'em, I\nremember, because you _would_ keep it in your mouth while you swung in\nthe hammock. And you thought it would surely kill you, so you knelt\ndown in the dry leaves and prayed God He wouldn't let it kill you.'\n\n\"'But you weren't there,' I protested; 'nobody was there. So nobody\never knew anything about it, though may be you--' For I had just\nremembered that Stella was dead, only I knew it was against some rule\nto mention it.\n\n\"'Well, at any rate I'm _here_,' said Stella, 'and Ole-Luk-Oie is kind;\nand we had better go and hunt the great boar at once, I suppose, since\nthat is what the people on the mustard-jars always do.'\n\n\"'But how did you come hither, O my dear--?'\n\n\"'Why, through your wanting me so much,' she said. 'How else?'\n\n\"And I understood....\n\n\"So we went and slew the great boar. I slew it personally, with a long\nspear, and with Stella clasping her hands in the background. Only there\nwas a nicked place in the mustard-jar, where I had dropped it on the\nhearth some fifteen years ago, and my horse kept stumbling over this\ncrevice, so that I knew it was the red jar and the buttons we were\nriding around. And afterward I made a song in honour of my Stella,--a\nsong so perfect that I presently awoke, weeping with joy that I had\nmade a song so beautiful, and with the knowledge I could not now\nrecollect a single word of it; and I knew that neither I nor any other\nman could ever make again a song one-half so beautiful....\n\n\"Since then Ole-Luk-Oie--or someone--has been very kind at times. He\nalways lets me into pictures, though, never into mouse-holes and\nhen-houses and silly places like that, as he did little Hjalmar. I\ndon't know why....\n\n\"Once it was into the illustrations to the _Popular Tales of\nPoictesme_, and we met my great grandfather Jurgen there. And once it\nwas into the picture on the cover of that unveracious pamphlet the\nmanager of the Green Chalybeate sends in the spring to everybody who\nhas once been there. That time was very odd.\n\n\"It is a picture of the Royal Hotel, you may remember, as it used to be\na good ten years ago. Both fountains were playing in the sunlight,\n--they were torn down when I was at college, and I had almost forgotten\ntheir existence; and elegant and languid ladies were riding by, in\nvictorias, and under tiny parasols trimmed with fringe, and all these\nladies wore those preposterously big sleeves they used to wear then;\nand men in little visored skull caps were passing on tall old-fashioned\nbicycles, just as they do in the picture. Even the silk-hatted\ngentleman in the corner, pointing out the beauties of the building with\nhis cane, was there.\n\n\"And Stella and I walked past the margin of the picture, and so on down\nthe boardwalk to the other hotel, to look for our parents. And we\nagreed not to tell anyone that we had ever grown up, but just to let it\nbe a secret between us two; and we were to stay in the picture forever,\nand grow up all over again, only we would arrange everything\ndifferently. And Stella was never to go driving on the twenty-seventh\nof April, so that we would be quite safe, and would live together for a\nlong, long while.\n\n\"She wouldn't promise, though, that when Peter Blagden asked to be\nintroduced, she would refuse to meet him. She just giggled and shook\nher sunny head. She hadn't any hat on. She was wearing the\nblue-and-white sailor-suit, of course.\"....\n\n\n 4\n\nBut a servant was lighting up the front-hall, and the glare of it came\nthrough the open door, and now the room was just like any other room.\n\n\"And you are Robert Townsend!\" the marquise observed. \"The one my\nmother doesn't approve of as a visitor!\"\n\nMadame d'Arlanges said, with a certain lack of sequence: \"And yet you\nare planning to do precisely what Peter Blagden did. He liked Stella,\nshe amused him, and he thought her money would come in very handy; and\nso he, somehow, contrived to marry her in the end, because she was just\na child, and you were a child, and he wasn't. And he always lied to her\nabout--about those business-trips--even from the very first. I knew,\nbecause I'm not a sentimental person. But, Bob, how can you stoop to\nmimic Peter Blagden! For you are doing precisely what he did; and for\nRosalind, just as it was for Stella, it is almost irresistible, to have\nthe chance of reforming a man who has notoriously been 'talked about.'\nStill, I see that for Stella's sake you won't lie as steadfastly to\nRosalind as Peter did to Stella. It is none of my business of course;\noh, I don't meddle. I merely prophesy that you won't.\"\n\nBut those lights had made an astonishing difference. And so, \"But why\nnot?\" said I. \"It is the immemorial method of dealing with savages; and\nsurely women can never expect to become quite civilised so long as\nchivalry demands that a man say to a woman only what he believes she\nwants to hear? Ah, no, my dear Lizzie; when a man tries to get into a\nwoman's favour, custom demands that he palliate the invasion with\nflatteries and veiled truths--or, more explicitly, with lies,--just as\nany sensible explorer must come prepared to leave a trail of\nlooking-glasses and valueless bright beads among the original owners of\nany unknown country. For he doesn't know what obstacles he may\nencounter, and he has been taught, from infancy, to regard any woman as\na baleful and unfathomable mystery--\"\n\n\"She is never so--heaven help her!--if the man be sufficiently\nworthless.\"\n\n\"I rejoice that we are so thoroughly at one. For upon my word, I\nbelieve this widespread belief in feminine inscrutability is the result\nof a conspiracy on the part of the weaker sex; and that every mother is\nsomehow pledged to inculcate this belief into the immature masculine\nmind. Apparently the practice originated in the Middle Ages, for it\nnever seemed to occur to anybody before then that a woman was\nparticularly complex. Though, to be sure, Catullus now--\" \"This is not\na time for pedantry. I don't in the least care what Catullus or anyone\nelse observed concerning anything--\" \"But I had not aspired, my dear\nLizzie, to be even remotely pedantic. I was simply about to remark that\nCatullus, or Ariosto, or Coventry Patmore, or King Juba, or Posidonius,\nor Sir John Vanbrugh, or perhaps, Agathocles of Chios, or else\nSimonides the Younger, has conceded somewhere, that women are, in\ncertain respects, dissimilar, as it were, to men.\" \"I am merely urging\nyou not to marry this silly little Rosalind, for the excellent reason\nthat you _did_ love my darling Stella even more than I, and that\nRosalind is in love with you.\" \"Do you really think so?\" said I. \"Why,\nthen, actuated by the very finest considerations of decency and\nprudence and generosity, I shall, of course, espouse her the very next\nNovember that ever is.\"\n\nThe marquise retorted: \"No,--because you are at bottom too fond of\nRosalind Jemmett; and, besides, it isn't really a question of your\nfeeling toward _her_. In any event, I begin to like you too well, Bob,\nto let you kiss me any more.\"\n\nI declared that I detested paradox. Then I went home to supper.\n\n\n 5\n\nBut, for all this, I meditated for a long while upon what Lizzie had\nsaid. It was true that I was really fond of \"proper\" little Rosalind\nJemmett; concerning myself I had no especial illusions; and, to my\ncredit, I faced what I considered the real issue, squarely.\n\nWe were in Aunt Marcia's parlour. Rosalind was an orphan, and lived in\nturn with her three aunts. She said the other two were less unendurable\nthan Aunt Marcia, and I believed her. I consider, to begin with, that a\nperson is not civilised who thumps upon the floor upstairs with a\npoker, simply because it happens to be eleven o'clock; and moreover,\nAunt Marcia's parlour--oh, it really was a \"parlour,\"--was entirely too\nlike the first night of a charity bazaar, when nothing has been sold.\n\nThe room was not a particularly large one; but it contained exactly\nthree hundred and seven articles of bijouterie, not estimating the\nchina pug-dog upon the hearth. I know, for I counted them.\n\nBesides, there were twenty-eight pictures upon the walls--one in oils\nof the late Mr. Dumby (for Aunt Marcia was really Mrs. Clement Dumby),\npainted, to all appearances, immediately after the misguided gentleman\nwho married Aunt Marcia had been drowned, and before he had been wiped\ndry,--and for the rest, everywhere the eye was affronted by engravings\nframed in gilt and red-plush of \"Sanctuary,\" \"Le Hamac,\" \"Martyre\nChr\u00e9tienne,\" \"The Burial of Latan\u00e9,\" and other Victorian outrages.\n\nThen on an easel there was a painting of a peacock, perched upon an\nurn, against a gilded background; this painting irrelevantly deceived\nyour expectations, for it was framed in blue plush. Also there were\n\"gift-books\" on the centre table, and a huge volume, again in red\nplush, with its titular \"Album\" cut out of thin metal and nailed to the\ncover. This album contained calumnious portraits of Aunt Marcia's\nfamily, the most of them separately enthroned upon the same imitation\nrock, in all the pride of a remote, full-legged and starchy youth, each\npicture being painfully \"coloured by hand.\"\n\n\n 6\n\n\"Do you know why I want to marry you?\" I demanded of Rosalind, in such\nsurroundings, apropos of a Mrs. Vokins who had taken a house in\nLichfield for the winter, and had been at school somewhere in the\nbackwoods with Aunt Marcia, and was \"dying to meet me.\"\n\nShe answered, in some surprise: \"Why, because you have the good taste\nto be heels over head in love with me, of course.\"\n\nI took possession of her hands. \"If there is anything certain in this\nworld of uncertainties, it is that I am not the least bit in love with\nyou. Yet, only yesterday--do you remember, dear?\"\n\nShe answered, \"I remember.\"\n\n\"But I cannot, for the life of me, define what happened yesterday. I\nmerely recall that we were joking, as we always do when together, and\nthat on a wager I loosened your hair. Then as it tumbled in great\nhoney-coloured waves about you, you were silent, and there came into\nyour eyes a look I had never seen before. And even now I cannot define\nwhat happened, Rosalind! I only know I caught your face between my\nhands, and for a moment held it so, with fingers that have not yet\nforgotten the feel of your soft, thick hair,--and that for a breathing\nspace your eyes looked straight into mine. Something changed in me\nthen, my lady. Something changed in you, too, I think.\"\n\nThen Rosalind said, \"Don't, Jaques--!\" She was horribly embarrassed.\n\n\"For I knew you willed me to possess you, and that possession would\nseem as trivial as a fiddle in a temple.... Yet, too, there was a\nlustful beast, somewhere inside of me, which nudged me to--kiss you,\nsay! But nothing happened. I did not even kiss you, my beautiful and\nwealthy Rosalind.\"\n\n\"Don't keep on talking about the money,\" she wailed. \"Why, you can't\nbelieve I think you mercenary!\"\n\n\"I would estimate your intellect far more cheaply, my charming\nRosalind, if you thought anything else; for of course I am. I wanted to\nsettle myself, you conceive, and as an accomplice you were very\neligible. I now comprehend it is beyond the range of rationality, dear\nstranger, that we should ever marry each other; and so we must not. We\nmust not, you comprehend, since though we lived together through ten\npatriarchal lifetimes we would die strangers to each other.\nFor you, dear clean-souled girl that you are, were born that you might\nbe the wife of a strong man and the mother of his sturdy children. The\nworld was made for you and for your offspring; and in time your\nchildren will occupy this world and make the laws for us irrelevant\nfolk that scribble and paint and design all useless and beautiful\nthings, and thus muddle away our precious lives. No, you may not wisely\nmate with us, for you are a shade too terribly at ease in the universe,\nyou sensible people.\"\n\n\"But I love Art,\" said Rosalind, bewildered.\n\n\"Yes,--but by the tiniest syllable a thought too volubly, my dear. You\nare the sort that quotes the Rubaiyat. Whereas I--was it yesterday or\nthe day before you told me, with a wise pucker of your beautiful low,\nwhite brow, that I had absolutely no sense of the responsibilities of\nlife? Well, I really haven't, dear stranger, as you appraise them; and,\nindeed, I fear we must postpone our agreement upon any possible\nsubject, until the coming of the Coquecigrues. We see the world so\ndifferently, you and I,--and for that same reason I cannot but adore\nyou, Rosalind. For with you I can always speak my true thought and know\nthat you will never for a moment suspect it to be anything but irony.\nAh, yes, we can laugh and joke together, and be thorough friends; but\nif there is anything certain in this world of uncertainties, it is that\nI am not, and cannot be, in love with you. And yet--I wonder now?\" said\nI, and I rose and paced Aunt Marcia's parlour.\n\n\"You wonder? Don't you understand even now?\" the girl said shyly. \"I am\nnot as clever as you, of course; I have known that for a long while,\nJaques; and to-night in particular I don't quite follow you, my dear,\nbut I love you, and--why, there is _nothing_ I could deny you!\"\n\n\"Then give me back my freedom,\" said I. \"For, look you, Rosalind,\nmarriage is proverbially a slippery business. Always there are a\nvariety of excellent reasons for perpetrating matrimony; but the rub of\nit is that not any one of them insures you against to-morrow. Love, for\nexample, we have all heard of; but I have known fine fellows to fling\naway their chances in life, after the most approved romantic fashion,\non account of a pretty stenographer, and to beat her within the\ntwelvemonth. And upon my word, you know, nobody has a right to blame\nthe swindled lover for doing this--\"\n\nI paused to inspect the china pug-dog which squatted on the pink-tiled\nhearth and which glared inanely at the huge brass coal-box just\nopposite. Then I turned from these two abominations and faced Rosalind\nwith a bantering flirt of my head.\n\n\"--For put it that I marry some entrancing slip of girlhood, what am I\nto say when, later, I discover myself irrevocably chained to a fat and\ndowdy matron? I married no such person, I have indeed sworn eternal\nfidelity to an entirely different person; and this unsolicited usurper\nof my hearth is nothing whatever to me, unless perhaps the object of my\nentire abhorrence. Yet am I none the less compelled to justify the\nensuing action before an irrational audience, which faces common logic\nin very much the attitude of Augustine's famed adder! Decidedly I think\nthat, on the whole, I would prefer my Freedom.\"\n\nIt was as though I had struck her. She sat as if frozen. \"Jaques, is\nthere another woman in this?\"\n\n\"Why, in a fashion, yes. Yet it is mainly because I am really fond of\nyou, Rosalind.\"\n\nShe handed me that exceedingly expensive ring the jeweler had charged\nto me. I thought her action damnably theatrical, but still, it was not\nas though I could afford to waste money on rings, so I took the trinket\nabsent-mindedly.\n\n\"You are unflatteringly prompt in closing out the account,\" I said,\nwith a grieved smile....\n\n\"Good-bye!\" said Rosalind, and her voice broke. \"Oh, and I had\nthought--! Well, as it is, I pay for the luxury of thinking, just as\nyou forewarned me, don't I, Jaques? And you won't forget the\nhall-light? Aunt Marcia, you know--but how glad _she_ will be! I feel\nrather near to Aunt Marcia to-night,\" said Rosalind.\n\n\n 7\n\nShe left Lichfield the next day but one, and spent the following winter\nwith the aunt that lived in Brooklyn. She was Rosalind Gelwix the next\ntime I saw her....\n\nAnd Aunt Marcia, whose taste is upon a par with her physical\nattractions, inserted a paragraph in the \"Social Items\" of the\nLichfield _Courier-Herald_ to announce the breaking-off of the\nengagement. Aunt Marcia also took the trouble to explain, quite\nconfidentially, to some seven hundred and ninety-three people, just why\nthe engagement had been broken off: and these explanations were more\ncreditable to Mrs. Dumby's imagination than to me.\n\nAnd I remembered, then, that the last request my mother made of me was\nto keep out of the newspapers--\"except, of course, the social\nitems\"....\n\n\n\n\n20.\n\n_He Dines Out, Impeded by Superstitions_\n\n\nWithin the week I had repented of what I termed my idiotic quixotism,\nand for precisely nine days after that I cursed my folly. And then, at\nthe Provises, I comprehended that in breaking off my engagement to\nRosalind Jemmett I had acted with profound wisdom, and I unfolded my\nnapkin, and said:\n\n\"Do you know I didn't catch your name--not even this time?\"\n\nShe took a liberal supply of lemon juice. \"How delightful!\" she\nmurmured, \"for I heard yours quite distinctly, and these oysters are\ndelicious.\"\n\nI noted with approval that her gown was pink and fluffy; it had also the\nadvantage of displaying shoulders that were incredibly white, and a\nthroat which was little short of marvellous. \"I am glad,\" I whispered,\nconfidentially, \"that you are still wearing that faint vein about your\nleft temple. I thought it admirable for early morning wear upon the\nhouse tops of Liege, but it seems equally effective for dinner parties.\"\n\nShe raised her eyebrows slightly and selected a biscuit.\n\n\"You see,\" said I, \"I was horribly late. And when Kittie Provis said,\n'Allow me,' and I saw--well, I didn't care,\" I concluded, lucidly,\n\"because to have every one of your dreams come true, all of a sudden,\nleaves you past caring.\"\n\n\"It really is funny,\" she confided to a spoonful of _consomme a la\nJulienne_.\n\n\"After almost two years!\" sighed I, ever so happily. But I continued,\nwith reproach, \"To go without a word--that very day--\"\n\n\"Mamma--\" she began.\n\nI recalled the canary-bird, and the purple shawl. \"I sought wildly,\"\nsaid I; \"you were evanished. The _proprietaire_ was tearing his hair--no\ninsurance--he knew nothing. So I too tore my hair; and I said things.\nThere was a row. For he also said things: 'Figure to yourselves,\nmessieurs! I lose the Continental--two ladies come and go, I know not\nwho--I am ruined, desolated, is it not?--and this pig of an American\nblusters--ah, my new carpets, just down, what horror!' And then, you\nknow, he launched into a quite feeling peroration concerning our\nnotorious custom of tomahawking one another--\n\n\"Yes,\" I coldly concluded into Mrs. Clement Dumby's ear, \"we all behaved\ndisgracefully. As you very justly observe, liquor has been the curse of\nthe South.\" It was of a piece with Kittie Provis to put me next to Aunt\nMarcia, I reflected.\n\nAnd mentally I decided that even though a portion of my assertions had\nnot actually gone through the formality of occurring, it all might very\neasily have happened, had I remained a while longer in Liege; and then\nensued a silent interval and an entree.\n\n\"And so--?\"\n\n\"And so I knocked about the world, in various places, hoping against\nhope that at last--\"\n\n\"Your voice carries frightfully--\"\n\nI glanced toward Mrs. Clement Dumby, who, as a dining dowager of many\nyears' experience, was, to all appearances, engrossed by the contents of\nher plate. \"My elderly neighbour is as hard of hearing as a\ntelephone-girl,\" I announced. She was the exact contrary, which was why\nI said it quite audibly. \"And your neighbour--why, _his_ neighbour is\nNannie Allsotts. We might as well be on a desert island, Elena--\" And\nthe given name slipped out so carelessly as to appear almost accidental.\n\n\"Sir!\" said she, with proper indignation; \"after so short an\nacquaintance--\"\n\n\"Centuries,\" I suggested, meekly. \"You remember I explained about that.\"\n\nShe frowned,--an untrustworthy frown that was tinged with laughter. \"One\nmeets so many people! Yes, it really is frightfully warm, Colonel\nGrimshaw; they ought to open some of the windows.\"\n\n\"Er--haw--hum! Didn't see you at the Anchesters.\"\n\n\"No; I am usually lucky enough to be in bed with a sick headache when\nMrs. Anchester entertains. Of two evils one should choose the lesser,\nyou know.\"\n\nIn the manner of divers veterans Colonel Grimshaw evinced his mirth upon\na scale more proper to an elephant; and relapsed, with a reassuring air\nof having done his duty once and for all.\n\n\"I never,\" she suggested, tentatively, \"heard any more of your poem,\nabout--?\"\n\n\"Oh, I finished it; every magazine in the country knows it. It is poor\nstuff, of course, but then how could I write of Helen when Helen had\ndisappeared?\"\n\nThe lashes exhibited themselves at full length. \"I looked her up,\"\nconfessed their owner, guiltily, \"in the encyclopaedia. It was very\ninstructive--about sun-myths and bronzes and the growth of the epic, you\nknow, and tree-worship and moon-goddesses. Of course\"--here ensued a\nflush and a certain hiatus in logic,--\"of course it is nonsense.\"\n\n\"Nonsense?\" My voice sank tenderly. \"Is it nonsense, Elena, that for two\nyears I have remembered the woman whose soft body I held, for one\nunforgettable moment, in my arms? and nonsense that I have fought all\nthis time against--against the temptations every man has,--that I might\nask her at last--some day when she at last returned, as always I knew\nshe would--to share a fairly decent life? and nonsense that I have\ndreamed, waking and sleeping, of a wondrous face I knew in Ilium first,\nand in old Rome, and later on in France, I think, when the Valois were\nkings? Well!\" I sighed, after vainly racking my brain for a tenderer\nfragment of those two-year-old verses, \"I suppose it is nonsense!\"\n\n\"The salt, please,\" quoth she. She flashed that unforgotten broadside at\nme. \"I believe you need it.\"\n\n\"Why, dear me! of course not!\" said I, to Mrs. Dumby; \"immorality lost\nthe true _cachet_ about the same time that ping-pong did. Nowadays\ndivorces are going out, you know, and divorcees are not allowed to.\nQuite modish women are seen in public with their husbands nowadays.\"\n\n\"H'mph!\" said Mrs. Dumby; \"I've no doubt that you must find it a most\ninconvenient fad!\"\n\nI ate my portion of duck abstractedly. \"Thus to dive into the\nrefuse-heap of last year's slang does not quite cover the requirements\nof the case. For I wish--only I hardly dare to ask--\"\n\n\"If I were half of what you make out,\" meditatively said she, \"I would\nbe a regular fairy, and couldn't refuse you the usual three wishes.\"\n\n\"Two,\" I declared, \"would be sufficient.\"\n\n\"First?\"\n\n\"That you tell me your name.\"\n\n\"I adore orange ices, don't you? And the second?\" was her comment.\n\n\"Well, then, you' re a pig,\" was mine. \"You are simply a nomenclatural\nBerkshire. But the second is that you let me measure your finger--oh,\nany finger will do. Say, the third on the left hand.\"\n\n\"You really talk to me as if--\" But this non-existent state of affairs\nproved indescribable, and the unreal condition lapsed into a pout.\n\n\"Oh, very possibly!\" I conceded; \"since the way in which a man talks to\na woman--to _the_ woman--depends by ordinary upon the depth--\"\n\n\"The depth of his devotion?\" she queried, helpfully. \"Of course!\"\n\nI faced the broadside, without flinching. \"No,\" said I, critically; \"the\ndepth of her dimples.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Nevertheless, the dimples were, and by a deal, the more\nconspicuous. We were getting on pretty well.\n\nI bent forward; there was a little catch in my voice. Aunt Marcia was\nlistening. I wanted her to listen.\n\n\"You must know that I love you,\" I said, simply, \"I have always loved\nyou, I think, since the moment my eyes first fell upon you in\nthat--other pink thing. Of course, I realize the absurdity of my talking\nin this way to a woman whose name I don't know; but I realise more\nstrongly that I love you. Why, there is not a pulse in my body which\nisn't throbbing and tingling and leaping riotously from pure joy of\nbeing with you again, Elena! And in time, you will love me a little,\nsimply because I want you to,--isn't that always a woman's main reason\nfor caring for a man?\"\n\nShe considered this, dubious and flushed.\n\n\"I will not insist,\" said I, with a hurried and contented laugh, \"that\nyou were formerly an Argive queen. I mean I will not be obstinate about\nit, because that, I confess, was a paraphrase of my verses. But Helen\nhas always been to me the symbol of perfect loveliness, and so it was\nnot unnatural that I should confuse you with her.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said she, demurely.\n\n\"I half believe it is true, even now; and if not--well, Helen was\nacceptable enough in her day, Elena, but I am willing to Italianise, for\nI have seen you and loved you, and Helen is forgot. It is not exactly\nthe orthodox pace for falling in love,\" I added, with a boyish candour,\n\"but it is very real to me.\"\n\n\"You--you couldn't have fallen in love--really--\"\n\n\"It was not in the least difficult,\" I protested.\n\n\"And you don't even know my _name_--\"\n\n\"I know, however, what it is going to be,\" said I; \"and Mrs. 'Enry\n'Awkins, as we'll put it, has found favour in the judgment of\nconnoisseurs. So after dinner--in an hour--?\"\n\n\"Oh, very well! since you're an author and insist, I will be ready, in\nan hour, to decline you, with thanks.\"\n\n\"Rejection not implying any lack of merit,\" I suggested. \"This is\ndamnable iteration; but I am accustomed to it.\"\n\nBut by this, Mrs. Provis was gathering eyes around the table, and her\nguests arose, with the usual outburst of conversation, and swishing of\ndresses, and the not always unpremeditated dropping of handkerchiefs and\nfans. Mrs. Clement Dumby bore down upon us now, a determined and\ngenerously proportioned figure in her notorious black silk.\n\n\"Really,\" said she, aggressively, \"I never saw two people more\nengrossed. My dear Mrs. Barry-Smith, you have been so taken up with Mr.\nTownsend, all during dinner, that I haven't had a chance to welcome you\nto Lichfield. Your mother and I were at school together, you know. And\nyour husband was quite a beau of mine. So I don't feel, now, at all as\nif we were strangers--\"\n\nAnd thus she bore Elena off, and I knew that within ten minutes Elena\nwould have been warned against me, as \"not quite a desirable\nacquaintance, you know, my dear, and it is only my duty to tell you that\nas a young and attractive married woman--\"\n\n\n 2\n\n\"And so,\" I said in my soul, as the men redistributed themselves, \"she\nis married,--married while you were pottering with books and the turn of\nphrases and immortality and such trifles--oh, you ass! And to a man\nnamed Barry-Smith--damn him, I wonder whether he is the hungry scut that\nhasn't had his hair cut this fall, or the blancmange-bellied one with\nthe mashed-strawberry nose? Yes, I know everybody else. And Jimmy Travis\nis telling a funny story, so _laugh_! People will think you are grieving\nover Rosalind.... But why in heaven's name isn't Jimmy at home this very\nmoment,--with a wife and carpet-slippers and a large-size bottle of\nparegoric on his mantelpiece,--instead of here, grinning like a fool\nover some blatant indecency? He ought to marry; every young man ought to\nmarry. Oh, you futile, abject, burbling twin-brother of the first patron\nthat procured a reputation for Bedlam! why aren't _you_ married--married\nyears ago,--with a home of your own, and a victoria for Mrs. Townsend\nand bills from the kindergarten every quarter? Oh, you bartender of\nverbal cocktails! I believe your worst enemy flung your mind at you in a\nmoment of unbridled hatred.\"\n\nSo I snapped the stem of my glass carefully, and scowled with morose\ndisapproval at the unconscious Mr. Travis, and his now-applauded and\nvery Fescennine jest....\n\n\n 3\n\nI found her inspecting a bulky folio with remarkable interest. There was\na lamp, with a red shade, that cast a glow over her, such as one\nsometimes sees reflected from a great fire. The people about us were\nchattering idiotically, and something inside my throat prevented my\nbreathing properly, and I was miserable.\n\n\"Mrs. Barry-Smith,\"--thus I began,--\"if you've the tiniest scrap of pity\nin your heart for a very presumptuous, blundering and unhappy person, I\npray you to forgive and to forget, as people say, all that I have\nblatted out to you. I spoke, as I thought, to a free woman, who had the\nright to listen to my boyish talk, even though she might elect to laugh\nat it. And now I hardly dare to ask forgiveness.\"\n\nMrs. Barry-Smith inspected a view of the Matterhorn, with careful\ndeliberation. \"Forgiveness?\" said she.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said I, \"I _don't_ deserve it.\" And I smiled most resolutely.\n\"I had always known that somewhere, somehow, you would come into my life\nagain. It has been my dream all these two years; but I dream carelessly.\nMy visions had not included this--obstacle.\"\n\nShe made wide eyes at me. \"What?\" said she.\n\n\"Your husband,\" I suggested, delicately.\n\nThe eyes flashed. And a view of Monaco, to all appearances, awoke some\npleasing recollection. \"I confess,\" said Mrs. Barry-Smith, \"that--for\nthe time--I had quite forgotten him. I--I reckon you must think me\nvery horrid?\"\n\nBut she was at pains to accompany this query with a broadside that\nrendered such a supposition most unthinkable. And so--\n\n\"I think you--\" My speech was hushed and breathless, and ended in a\nclick of the teeth. \"Oh, don't let's go into the minor details,\"\nI pleaded.\n\nThen Mrs. Barry-Smith descended to a truism. \"It is usually better not\nto,\" said she, with the air of an authority. And latterly, addressing\nthe facade of Notre Dame, \"You see, Mr. Barry-Smith being so much\nolder than I--\"\n\n\"I would prefer that. Of course, though, it is none of my business.\"\n\n\"You see, you came and went so suddenly that--of course I never thought\nto see you again--not that I ever thought about it, I reckon--\" Her\ncandour would have been cruel had it not been reassuringly\nover-emphasized. \"And Mr. Barry-Smith was very pressing--\"\n\n\"He would be,\" I assented, after consideration. \"It is, indeed, the\nsingle point in his outrageous conduct I am willing to condone.\"\n\n\"--and he was a great friend of my father's, and I _liked_ him--\"\n\n\"So you married him and lived together ever afterward, without ever\nthrowing the tureen at each other. That is the most modern version; but\nthere is usually a footnote concerning the bread-and-butter plates.\"\n\nShe smiled, inscrutably, a sphinx in Dresden china. \"And yet,\" she\nmurmured, plaintively, \"I _would_ like to know what you think of me.\"\n\n\"Why, prefacing with the announcement that I pray God I may never see\nyou after to-night, I think you the most adorable creature He ever made.\nWhat does it matter now? I have lost you. I think--ah, desire o' the\nworld, what can I think of you? The notion of you dazzles me like\nflame,--and I dare not think of you, for I love you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" she queried, sweetly; \"then I reckon Mrs. Dumby was right after\nall. She said you were a most depraved person and that, as a young\nand--well, _she_ said it, you know--attractive widow--\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said I; and I sat down. \"Elena Barry-Smith,\" I added, \"you are an\nunmitigated and unconscionable and unpardonable rascal. There is just\none punishment which would be adequate to meet your case; and I warn you\nthat I mean to inflict it. Why, how dare you be a widow! The court\ndecides it is unable to put up with any such nonsense, and that you've\ngot to stop it at once.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said she, tossing her head and moving swiftly, \"one would\nthink we _were_ on a desert island!\"\n\n\"Or a strange roof\"--and I laughed, contentedly. \"Meanwhile, about that\nring--it should be, I think, a heavy, Byzantine ring, with the stones\nsunk deep in the dull gold. Yes, we'll have six stones in it; say, R, a\nruby; O, an opal; B, a beryl; E, an emerald; R, a ruby again, I suppose;\nand T, a topaz. Elena, that's the very ring I mean to buy as soon as\nI've had breakfast, tomorrow, as a token of my mortgage on the desire of\nthe world, and as the badge of your impendent slavery.\" And I reflected\nthat Rosalind had, after all, behaved commendably in humiliating me by\nso promptly returning this ring.\n\nVery calmly Elena Barry-Smith regarded the Bay of Naples; very calmly\nshe turned to the Taj Mahal. \"An obese young Lochinvar,\" she reflected\naloud, \"who has seen me twice, unblushingly assumes he is about to marry\nme! Of course,\" she sighed, quite tolerantly, \"I know he is clean out of\nhis head, for otherwise--\" \"Yes,--otherwise?\" I prompted.\n\n\"--he would never ask me to wear an opal. Why,\" she cried in horror, \"I\ncouldn't think of it!\" \"You mean--?\" said I.\n\nShe closed the album, with firmness. \"Why, you are just a child,\" said\nMrs. Barry-Smith. \"We are utter strangers to each other. Please remember\nthat, for all you know, I may have an unbridled temper, or an imported\ncomplexion, or a liking for old man Ibsen. What you ask--only you don't,\nyou simply assume it,--is preposterous. And besides, opals\n_are_ unlucky.\"\n\n\"Desire o' the world,\" I said, in dolorous wise, \"I have just remembered\nthe black-lace mitts and reticule you left upon the dinner-table. Oh,\ntruly, I had meant to bring 'em to you--Only _do_ you think it quite\ngood form to put on those cloth-sided shoes when you've been invited to\na real party?\"\n\nFor a moment Mrs. Barry-Smith regarded me critically. Then she shook her\nhead, and tried to frown, and reopened the album, and inspected the\ncrater of Vesuvius, and quite frankly laughed. And a tender, pink-tipped\nhand rested upon my arm for an instant,--a brief instant, yet pulsing\nwith a sense of many lights and of music playing somewhere, and of a\nman's heart keeping time to it.\n\n\"If you were to make it an onyx--\" said Mrs. Barry-Smith.\n\n\n\n\n21.\n\n_He is Urged to Desert His Galley_\n\n\nShe had been a widow even when I first encountered her in Liege. I may\nhave passed her dozens of times, only she was in mourning then, for\nBarry-Smith, and so I never really saw her.\n\nIt seems, though, that \"in the second year\" it is permissible to wear\npink garments in the privacy of your own apartments, and that if people\nsee you in them, accidentally, it is simply their own fault.\n\nAnd very often they are punished for it; as most certainly was I, for\nElena led me a devil's dance of jealousy, and rapture, and abject\nmisery, and suspicion, and supreme content, that next four months. She\nand her mother had rented a house on Regis Avenue for the winter; and I\nfrequented it with zeal. Mrs. Vokins said I \"came reg'lar as\nthe milkman.\"\n\n\n 2\n\nNow of Mrs. Vokins I desire to speak with the greatest respect, if only\nfor the reason that she was Elena Barry-Smith's mother. Mrs. Vokins had,\nno doubt, the kindest heart in the world; but she had spent the first\nthirty years of her life in a mountain-girdled village, and after her\nhusband's wonderful luck--if you will permit me her vernacular,--in\nbeing \"let in on the groundfloor\" when the Amalgamated Tobacco Company\nwas organised, I believe that Mrs. Vokins was never again quite at ease.\n\nI am abysmally sure she never grew accustomed to being waited on by any\nservant other than a girl who \"came in by the day\"; though, oddly\nenough, she was incessantly harassed by the suspicion that one or\nanother \"good-for-nothing nigger was getting ready to quit.\" Her time\nwas about equally devoted to tending her canary, Bill Bryan, and to\nfurthering an apparently diurnal desire to have supper served a quarter\nof an hour earlier to-night, \"so that the servants can get off.\"\n\nFinally Mrs. Vokins considered that \"a good woman's place was right in\nher own home, with a nice clean kitchen,\" and was used to declare that\nthe fummadiddles of Mrs. Carrie Nation--who was in New York that winter,\nyou may remember, advocating Prohibition,--would never have been stood\nfor where Mrs. Vokins was riz. Them Yankee huzzies, she estimated, did\nbeat her time.\n\n\n 3\n\nIt was, and is, the oddest thing I ever knew of that Elena could have\nbeen her daughter. Though, mind you, even to-day, I cannot commit myself\nto any statement whatever as concerns Elena Barry-Smith, beyond\nasserting that she was beautiful. I am willing to concede that since the\nworld's creation there may have lived, say, six or seven women who were\nequally good to look upon; but at the bottom of my heart I know the\nconcession is simply verbal. For she was not pretty; she was not\nhandsome; she was beautiful. Indeed, I sometimes thought her beauty\novershadowed any serious consideration of the woman who wore it, just as\nin admiration of a picture you rarely think to wonder what sort of\ncanvas it is painted on.\n\nYes, I am quite sure, upon reflection, that to Elena Barry-Smith her\nbeauty was a sort of tyrant. She devoted her life, I think, to the\nretention of her charms; and what with the fixed seven hours for\nsleep--no more and not a moment less,--the rigid limits of her diet, the\nwalking of exactly five miles a day, and her mathematical adherence to a\npredetermined programme of massage and hair-treatment and manicuring and\nface-creams and so on, Elena had hardly two hours in a day at her\nown disposal.\n\nShe would as soon have thought of sacrificing her afternoon walk to the\nMusgrave Monument and back, as of having a front-tooth unnecessarily\nremoved; and would as willingly have partaken of prussic acid as of\ncandy or potatoes. She was, in fine, an artist of the truest type, in\nthat she immolated her body, and her own preferences, in the cause\nof beauty.\n\nNor was she vain, or stupid either, though what I have written vaguely\nsounds as though she were both. She was just Elena Barry-Smith, of whom\nyour memory was always how beautiful she had been at this or that\nparticular moment, rather than what she said or did. And I believe that\nevery man in Lichfield was in love with her.\n\nBut, in recollection of any person with whom you have had intimate and\ntender intercourse, the pre-eminent feature is the big host of questions\nwhich you cannot answer, or not, at least, with certainty....\n\n\n 4\n\nFor instance: the night of the Allardyce dance, after seeing Elena home,\nI stepped in for a moment to get warm and have her mix me a highball. We\nsat for a considerable while on the long sofa in the dimly-lighted\ndining room, talking in whispers so as not to disturb the rest of the\nhouse: and Elena was unusually beautiful that night, and I was more than\nusually in love, more thanks to three of the five drinks she mixed....\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" she stated, sighing.\n\nI did not say anything.\n\n\"Oh, well, then--! If you will just promise me,\" she stipulated, \"that\nyou will never in any way refer to it afterwards--\"\n\nSo I promised.... And the next day she met me, cool as the proverbial\ncucumber, and never once did she \"refer to it afterwards,\" nor did I\nthink it wise to do so either. But the incident, however delightful,\npuzzled me. It puzzles me even now....\n\n\n 5\n\nIn any event, she was not only beautiful but exceedingly well-to-do\nlikewise, since her dead father and her husband also had provided for\nher amply; and Lichfield sniggered in consequence, and as a matter of\ncourse assumed my devotion to be of astute and mercenary origin. But I\nhad, in this period, a variety of reasons to know that Lichfield was for\nonce entirely in the wrong; and that what Lichfield mistook to be the\nbegetter of, was in reality--so we will phrase it--the almost\nunnecessary augmenter of my infatuation. Of course I did not exactly\nobject to her having money....\n\nMeantime Elena was profoundly various. I told her once that being\nmarried to her would be the very next thing to owning a harem. And in\nconsequence of this same mutability, it was as late as March before\nElena Barry-Smith made up her mind to marry me; and I was so deliciously\nperturbed that the same night I wrote to tell Bettie Hamlyn all about\nit. I had accepted Rosalind more calmly somehow. Now I was dithyrambic;\nand you would never have suspected I had lived within fifty miles of\nBettie for an entire two years without attempting to communicate with\nher, for very certainly my letter did not touch upon the fact. I was, in\nfine, supremely happy, and I wanted Bettie, first of all, to know of\nthis circumstance, because my happiness had always made her happy too.\n\nThe act was natural enough; only Elena telephoned, at nine the following\nmorning, that she had altered her intention.\n\n\"My regret is beyond expression,\" said I, politely, \"I shall come for my\ntea at five, however.\"\n\nShe entered upon a blurred protest. \"You have already broken my heart,\"\nI said, with some severity, \"and now it would appear you contemplate\nswindling the remainder of my anatomy out of its deserts. You are a\ncurmudgeon.\" And I hung up the receiver.\n\nAnd my first thought was, \"Oh, how gladly I would give the gold of Ormus\nand of Alaska just to have my letter back!\" But I had mailed it,\nshuffling to the corner in my slippers, and without any collar on, in\nthe hushed middle of the night, because my letter had seemed so\nimportant then.\n\n\n 6\n\n\"Will you not have me, lady?\" I began that afternoon.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" she demurely responded, \"for I've decided it would be too\nmuch like living in my Sunday-clothes.\"\n\nAnd \"I give it up. So what's the answer?\" was my annotation.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not making jokes to-day. Why are you so--Oh, as we used to say\nat school,\" she re-began, _\"Que diable allais-tu faire dans\ncette galere?\"_\n\n\"I was born in a vale of tears, Elena, and must take the consequences of\nbeing found in such a situation.\"\n\nShe came to me, and her finger-tips touched my hand ever so lightly.\n\"That is another quotation, I suppose. And it is one other reason why I\nmean not to marry you. Frankly, you bore me to death with your\nerudition; you are three-quarters in love with me, but you pay heaps\nless attention to what I say about anything than to what Aristotle or\nsome other old fellow said about it. Oh, that I should have lived to be\njealous of Aristotle! Indeed I am, for I have the misfortune to be\nhideously in love with you. You are so exactly the sort of infant I\nwould like to adopt.\"\n\n\"Love,\" I suggested, \"while no longer an excuse for marriage, is at\nleast a palliation.\"\n\n\"Listen, dear. From the first I have liked you, but that was not very\nstrange, because I like almost everybody; but it was strange I should\nhave remembered you and have liked the idea of you ever since you went\naway that first time.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, this once I will excuse you--\"\n\n\"But it happened in this way: I had found everybody--very nice, you\nknow--particularly the men,--and the things which cannot be laughed at I\nhad always put aside as not worth thinking about. You like to laugh,\ntoo, but I have always known--and sometimes it gets me real mad to think\nabout it, I can tell you--that you could be in earnest if you chose, and\nI can't. And that makes me a little sorry and tremendously glad,\nbecause, quite frankly, I _am_ head over heels in love with you. That is\nwhy I don't intend to marry you.\"\n\nAnd I was not a little at sea. \"Oh, very well!\" I pleasantly announced,\n\"I shall become a prominent citizen at once, if that's all that is\nnecessary. I will join every one of the patriotic societies, and sit\nperpetually on platforms with a perspiring water-pitcher, and unveil\nthings every week, with felicitous allusions to the glorious past of our\ngrand old State; and have columns of applause in brackets on the front\npage of the _Courier-Herald_. I will even go into civic politics, if you\ninsist upon it, and leave round-cornered cards at all the drugstores, so\nthat everybody who buys a cigar will know I am subject to the Democratic\nprimary. I wonder, by the way, if people ever survive that malady? It\nsounds to me a deal more dangerous that epilepsy, say, yet lots of\npersons seem to have it--\"\n\nBut Elena was not listening. \"You know,\" she re-began, \"I could get out\nof it all very gracefully by telling you you drink too much. You\ncouldn't argue it, you know--particularly after your behavior\nlast Tuesday.\"\n\n\"Oh, now and then one must be sociable. You aren't a prude, Elena--\"\n\n\"However, I am not really afraid of that, somehow. I even confess I\ndon't actually _mind_ your being rather good for nothing. No woman ever\nreally does, though she has her preference, and pretends, of course, to\nmind a great deal. What I mean, then, is this: You don't marry just me.\nI--I have very few relations, just two brothers and my mother; yet, in a\nsense, you know, you marry them as well. But I don't believe you would\nlike being married to them. They are so different from you, dear. Your\nwhole view-point of life is different--\"\n\nI had begun to speak when she broke in: \"No, don't say anything, please,\nuntil I'm quite, quite through. My brothers are the most admirable men I\never knew. I love them more than I can say. I trust them more than I do\nyou. But they are just _good_. They don't fail in the really important\nthings of life, but they are remiss in little ways, they--they don't\n_care_ for the little elegantnesses, if that's a word. Even Arthur chews\ntobacco when he feels inclined. And he thinks no _man_ would smoke a\ncigarette. Oh, I can't explain just what I mean--\"\n\n\"I think I understand, Elena. Suppose we let it pass as said.\"\n\n\"And Mamma is not--we'll say, particularly highly educated. Oh, you've\nbeen very nice to her. She adores you. You won _her_ over completely\nwhen you took so much trouble to get her the out-of-print paper\nnovels--about the village maidens and the wicked dukes--in that idiotic\nCarnation Series she is always reading. The whole affair was just like\nboth of you, I think.\"\n\n\"But, oh, my dear--!\" I laughed.\n\n\"No, not one man in a thousand would have remembered it after she had\nsaid she did think the titles 'were real tasty'; and I don't believe any\nother man in the world would have spent a week in rummaging the\nsecond-hand bookstores, until he found them. Only I don't know, even\nyet, whether it was really kindness, or just cleverness that put you up\nto it--on account of me. And I do know that you are nice to her in\npretty much the same way you were nice to the negro cook yesterday. And\nI have had more advantages than she's had. But at bottom I'm really just\nlike her. You'd find it out some day. And--and that is what I mean,\nI think.\"\n\nI spoke at some length. It was atrocious nonsense which I spoke; in any\nevent, it looked like atrocious nonsense when I wrote it down just now,\nand so I tore it up. But I was quite sincere throughout that moment; it\nis the Townsend handicap, I suspect, always to be perfectly sincere for\nthe moment.\n\n\"Oh, well!\" she said; \"I'll think about it.\"\n\n\n 7\n\nThat night Elena and I played bridge against Nannie Allsotts and Warwick\nRisby. I was very much in love with Elena, but I hold it against her,\neven now, that she insisted on discarding from strength. However, there\nwas to be a little supper afterward, and you may depend upon it that\nMrs. Vokins was seeing to its preparation.\n\nShe came into the room about eleven o'clock, beaming with kindliness and\nflushed--I am sure,--by some slight previous commerce with the\nkitchen-fire.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Mrs. Vokins, comfortably; \"and who's a-beating?\"\n\nI looked up. I must protest, until my final day, I could not help it.\n\"Why, we is,\" I said.\n\nAnd Nannie Allsotts giggled, ever so slightly, and Warwick Risby had\nhalf risen, with a quite infuriate face, and I knew that by to-morrow\nthe affair would be public property, and promptly lost the game and\nrubber. Afterward we had our supper.\n\nWhen the others had gone--for my footing in the house was such that I,\nby ordinary, stayed a moment or two after the others had gone,--Elena\nBarry-Smith came to me and soundly boxed my jaws.\n\n\"That,\" she said, \"is one way to deal with you.\"\n\nA minute ago I had been ashamed of myself. I had not room to be that\nnow; I was too full of anger. \"I did make rather a mess of it,\" I\nequably remarked, \"but, you see, Nannie had shown strength in diamonds,\nand I simply couldn't resist the finesse. So they made every one of\ntheir clubs. And I hadn't any business to take the chance of course at\nthat stage, with the ace right in my hand--\"\n\n\"Arthur would have said, before he'd thought of it, 'You damn fool--!'\nAnd then he would have apologised for forgetting himself in the presence\nof a lady,\" she said, in a sorry little voice. \"Yes, you--you _have_\nhurt me,\" she presently continued,--\"just as you meant to do, if that's\na comfort to you. I feel as though I'd smacked a marble statue. You are\nthe sort that used to take snuff just before they had their heads cut\noff, and when _they_ were in the wrong. And I'm not. That's always been\nthe trouble.\"\n\n\"Elena!\" I began,--\"wait, just a moment! I'm in anger now--!\" It was not\nmuch to stammer out, but for me, who have the Townsend temper, it was\nvery hard to say.\n\n\"You talk about loving me! and I believe you do love me, in at any rate\na sort of way. But you'll never forget, you never _have_ forgotten,\nthose ancestors of yours who were in the House of Burgesses when I\nhadn't any ancestors at all. It isn't fair, because we haven't got the\nchance to pick our parents, and it's absurd, and--it's true. The woman\nis my mother, and I'll be like her some day, very probably. Yes, she\n_is_ ignorant and tacky, and at times she is ridiculous. She hadn't even\nthe smartness to notice it when you made a fool of her; and if anybody\nwere to explain it to her she would just laugh and say, 'Law, I don't\nmind, because young people always have to have their fun, I reckon.' And\nshe would forgive you! Why, she adores you! she's been telling me for\nmonths that you're 'a heap the nicest young man that visits with me.'\"\n\nAfterward Elena paused for an instant. \"I think that is all,\" she said.\n\"It's a difference that isn't curable. Yes, I simply wanted to tell you\nthat much, and then ask you to go, I believe--\"\n\n\"So you don't wish me, Elena, in the venerable phrase, to make an honest\nwoman of you?\"\n\nShe had half turned, standing, in pink and silver fripperies, with one\nbared arm resting on the chair back, in one of her loveliest attitudes.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I was referring to what happened the other night, after the Allardyce\ndance.\"\n\nAnd Elena smiled rather strangely. \"You baby! how much would it shock\nyou if I told you no woman really minds about that either? Any way, you\nhave broken your solemn promise,\" she said, with indignation.\n\n\"Ah, but perfidy seemed, somehow, in tone with an establishment wherein\none concludes the evening's entertainment by physical assault upon the\nguests. Frankly, my dear\"--I observed, with my most patronizing languor,\n--\"your breeding is not quite that to which I have been accustomed, and\nI have had a rather startling glimpse of Lena Vokins, with all the\nlaboriously acquired veneering peeling off. Still, in view of\neverything, I suppose I do owe it to you to marry you, if you insist--\"\n\n\"Insist! I wouldn't wipe my feet on you!\"\n\n\"That especial demonstration of affection was not, as I recall,\nrequested of you. So it is all off? along with the veneering, eh? Well,\nperhaps I did attach too much importance to that diverting epilogue to\nthe Allardyce dance. And as you say, Elena--and I take your word for it,\ngladly,--once one has become used to granting these little favors\nindiscriminately--\"\n\n\"Get out of my house!\" Elena said, quite splendid in her fury, \"or I\nwill have you horsewhipped. I was fond of you. You would not let me be\nin peace. And I didn't know you until to-night for the sneering,\nstuck-up dirty beast you are at heart--\" She came nearer, and her\nglittering eyes narrowed. \"And you have no hold on me, no letters to\nblackmail me with, and nobody anywhere would take your word for anything\nagainst mine. You would only be whipped by some real man, and probably\nshot. So do you remember to keep a watch upon that lying, sneering mouth\nof yours! And do you get out of my house!\"\n\n\"It is only rented,\" I submitted: \"yet, after all, to boast\nvaingloriously of their possessions is pardonable in those who have\nrisen in the world, and aren't quite accustomed to it....\" There were a\npair of us when it came to tempers.\n\n\n 8\n\nAnd I went homeward almost physically sick with rage. I knew, even then,\nthat, while Elena would forgive me in the outcome, if I set about the\nmatter properly, I could never bring myself to ask forgiveness. If only\nshe had been in the wrong, I could have eagerly gone back and have\nsubmitted to the extremest and the most outrageous tyranny she\ncould devise.\n\nBut--although I would never have blackmailed her, I think,--she had been\nmainly in the right. She had humiliated me, with a certain lack of\ndecorum, to be sure, but with some justice: and to pardon plain\nretaliation is beyond the compass of humanity. At least, it ranks among\nachievements which have always baffled me.\n\n\n\n\n22.\n\n_He Cleans the Slate_\n\n\nIt was within a month of this other disaster that Jasper Hardress came\nto America, accompanied by his wife. They planned a tour of the States,\nwhich they had not visited in seven years, and more particularly, as his\nforerunning letter said, they meant to investigate certain mining\nproperties which Hardress had acquired in Montana. So, not unstirred by\ntrepidations, I met them at the pier.\n\nFor I was already in New York, in part to see a volume of my short\nstories through the press--which you may or may not have read, in its\nelaborate \"gift-book\" form, under the title of _The Aspirants_,--and in\npart about less edifying employments. I was trying to forget Elena, and\nin Lichfield it was not possible to induce such forgetfulness without\naffording unmerited pleasure for gabbling busybodies.... It was not in\nme to apologise, except in a letter, where the wording and interminable\ntinkering with phraseology would enable me to forget it was I who was\napologising, until a bit of nearly perfect prose was safely mailed; and\nI knew she would not read any letter from me, because Elena comprehended\nthat I always persuaded her to do what I prompted, if only she\nlistened to me.\n\nAs it was, I talked that morning for an hour or more with fat Jasper\nHardress.... Even now I find the two errands which brought him to\nAmerica of not unlaughable incongruity.\n\n\n 2\n\nFor, first, he came as an agent of the Philomatheans, who were\nendeavouring to secure official recognition by the churches of America\nand England of a revised translation of, in any event, the New\nTestament.\n\nHe told me of a variety of buttressing reasons,--which I suppose are\nwell-founded, though I must confess I never investigated the matter. He\ntold me how the Authorised Version was a paraphrase, abounding in\nconfusions and in mistranslations from the Greek of Erasmus's New\nTestament, which, as the author confessed, \"was rather tumbled headlong\ninto the world than edited.\" And he told me how the edition of Erasmus\nitself was hastily prepared from careless copies of inaccurate\ntranscriptions of yet further copies of divers manuscripts of which the\noldest dates no further back than the fourth century, and is in turn,\nmost probably, just a liberal paraphrase, as all the others are, of\nstill another manuscript.\n\nSo that the English version, as I gathered, may be very fine English,\nbut has scarcely a leg left, when you consider it as a safe foundation\nfor superiority, or pillorying, or as a guide in conduct.\n\nI suspect, however, that Jasper Hardress somewhat overstated the case,\nsince on this subject he was a fanatic. To me it seemed rather quaint\nthat Hardress or anybody else should be bothering about such things.\n\nAnd as he feelingly declaimed concerning the great Uncials, and\nexplained why in this particular verse the Ephraem manuscript was in the\nright, whereas to probe the meaning of the following verse we clearly\nmust regard the Syriac version as of supreme authority, I could well\nunderstand how at one period or another his young wife must inevitably\nhave considered him in the light of a rather tedious person.\n\nAnd I told him that it hardly mattered, because the true test of a\nchurch-member was the ability to believe that when the Bible said\nanything inconvenient it really meant something else.\n\nBut actually I was not feeling over-cheerful, because Jasper's second\nobject in coming to America was to leave his wife in Sioux City, so that\nshe could secure a divorce from him, on quite un-Scriptural grounds.\nHardress told me of this at least without any excitement. He did not\nblame her. He was too old for her, too stolid, too dissimilar in every\nrespect, he said. Their marriage had been a mistake, that was all,--a\nmismating, as many marriages were. She wanted to marry someone else, he\nrather thought.\n\nAnd \"Oh, Lord! yes!\" I inwardly groaned. \"She probably does.\"\n\nAloud I said: \"But the Bible--Yes, I _am_ provincial at bottom. It's\nbecause I always think in nigger-English and translate it when I talk.\nIt was my Mammy, you see, who taught me how to think,--and in our\nnigger-English, what the Bible says is true. Why, Jasper, even this\nRevised Version of yours says flatly that a man--\"\n\n\"Child, child!\" said Jasper Hardress, and he patted my hair, and I\nreally think it crinkled under his touch, \"when you grow up--if indeed\nyou ever do,--you will find that a man's feeling for his wife and the\nmother of his children, is not altogether limited by what he has read in\na book. He wants--well, just her happiness.\"\n\nI looked up without thinking; and the aspect of that gross and\nunattractive man humiliated me. He had reached a height denied to such\nas I; and inwardly I cursed and envied this fat Jasper Hardress.... I\nwould have told him everything, had not the waiter come just then.\n\n\n 3\n\nAnd the same afternoon I was alone with Gillian Hardress, for the first\ntime in somewhat more than two years. We had never written each other; I\nhad been too cautious for that; and now when the lean, handsome woman\ncame toward me, murmuring \"Jack--\" very tenderly,--for she had always\ncalled me Jack, you may remember,--I raised a hand in protest.\n\n\"No,--that is done with, Jill. That is dead and buried now, my dear.\"\n\nShe remained motionless; only her eyes, which were like chrysoberyls,\nseemed to grow larger and yet more large. There was no anger in them,\nonly an augmenting wonder.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" she said at last, and seemed again to breathe; \"so that is\ndead and buried--in two years.\" Gillian Hardress spoke with laborious\nprecision, like a person struggling with a foreign language, and\narticulating each word to its least sound before laying tongue to its\nsuccessor.\n\n\"Yes! we have done with each other, once for all,\" said I, half angrily.\n\"I wash my hands of the affair, I clean the slate today. I am not polite\nabout it, and--I am sorry, dear. But I talked with your husband this\nmorning, and I will deceive Jasper Hardress no longer. The man loves you\nas I never dreamed of loving any woman, as I am incapable of loving any\nwoman. He dwarfs us. Oh, go and tell him, so that he may kill us both! I\nwish to God he would!\"\n\nMrs. Hardress said: \"You have planned to marry. It is time the prodigal\nmarry and settle down, is it not? So long as we were in England it did\nnot matter, except to that Faroy girl you seduced and flung out into the\nstreets--\"\n\n\"I naturally let her go when I found out--\"\n\n\"As if I cared about the creature! She's done with. But now we are in\nAmerica, and Mr. Townsend desires no entanglements just now that might\nprevent an advantageous marriage. So he is smitten--very\nconveniently--with remorse.\" Gillian began to laugh. \"And he discovers\nthat Jasper Hardress is a better man than he. Have I not always known\nthat, Jack?\"\n\nNow came a silence. \"I cannot argue with you as to my motives. Let us\nhave no scene, my dear--\"\n\n\"God keep us respectable!\" the woman said; and then: \"No; I can afford\nto make no scene. I can only long to be omnipotent for just one instant\nthat I might deal with you, Robert Townsend, as I desire--and even then,\nheaven help me, I would not do it!\" Mrs. Hardress sat down upon the\ndivan and laughed, but this time naturally. \"So! it is done with? I have\nhad my dismissal, and, in common justice, you ought to admit that I have\nreceived it not all ungracefully.\"\n\n\"From the first,\" I said, \"you have been the most wonderful woman I have\never known.\" And I knew that I was sincerely fond of Gillian Hardress.\n\n\"But please go now,\" she said, \"and have a telegram this evening that\nwill call you home, or to Kamchatka, or to Ecuador, or anywhere, on\nunavoidable business. No, it is not because I loathe the sight of you or\nfor any melodramatic reason of that sort. It is because, I think, I had\nfancied you to be not completely self-centred, after all, and I cannot\nbear to face my own idiocy. Why, don't you realize it was only yesterday\nyou borrowed money from Jasper Hardress--some more money!\"\n\n\"Well, but he insisted on it: and I owed it to you to do nothing to\narouse his suspicions--\"\n\n\"And I don't hate you even now! I wish God would explain to me why He\nmade women so.\"\n\n\"You accuse me of selfishness,\" I cried. \"Ah, let us distinguish, for\nthere is at times a deal of virtue in this vice. A man who devotes\nhimself to any particular art or pursuit, for instance, becomes more and\nmore enamoured of it as time wears on, because he comes to identify it\nwith himself; and a husband is fonder of his wife than of any other\nwoman,--at least, he ought to be,--not because he considers her the most\nbeautiful and attractive person of his acquaintance, but because she is\nthe one in whom he is most interested and concerned. He has a\nproprietary interest in her welfare, and she is in a manner part of\nhimself. Thus the arts flourish and the home-circle is maintained, and\nall through selfishness.\"\n\nI snapped my fingers airily; I was trying, of course, to disgust her by\nmy callousness. And it appeared I had almost succeeded.\n\n\"Please go!\" she said.\n\n\"But surely not while we are as yet involved in a question of plain\nlogic? You think selfishness a vice. None the less you must concede that\nthe world has invariably progressed because, upon the whole, we find\ncivilisation to be more comfortable than barbarism; and that a wholesome\napprehension of the penitentiary enables many of us to rise to\ndeaconships. Why, deuce take it, Jill! I may endow a hospital because I\nwant to see my name over the main entrance, I may give a beggar a penny\nbecause his gratitude puts me in a glow of benevolence that is cheap at\nthe price. So let us not rashly declare that selfishness is a vice,\nand--let us part friends, my dear.\"\n\nAnd I assumed possession of the thin hands that seemed to push me from\nher in a species of terror, and I gallantly lifted them to my lips.\n\nThe ensuing event was singular. Gillian Hardress turned to the door of\nher bedroom and brutally, as with two bludgeons, struck again and again\nupon its panels with clenched hand. She extended her hands to me, and\neverywhere their knuckles oozed blood. \"You kissed them,\" she said, \"and\neven today they liked it, and so they are not clean. They will never\nagain be clean, my dear. But they were clean before you came.\"\n\nThen Gillian Hardress left me, and where she had touched it, the brass\ndoor knob of her bedroom door was smeared with blood....\n\n\n 4\n\nWhen I had come again to Lichfield I found that in the brief interim of\nmy absence Elena Barry-Smith, without announcement, had taken the train\nfor Washington, and had in that city married Warwick Risby. This was, I\nknew, because she comprehended that, if I so elected, it was always in\nmy power to stop her halfway up the aisle and to dissuade her from\nadvancing one step farther.... \"I don't know _how_ it is!--\" she would\nhave said, in that dear quasi-petulance I knew so well....\n\nBut as it was, I met the two one evening at the Provises', and with\nexuberant congratulation. Then straddling as a young Colossus on the\nhearth-rug, and with an admonitory forefinger, I proclaimed to the\nuniverse at large that Mrs. Risby had blighted my existence and\nbeseeched for Warwick some immediate and fatal and particularly\nexcruciating malady. In fine, I was abjectly miserable the while that I\ndisarmed all comment by being quite delightfully boyish for a whole\ntwo hours.\n\nI must record it, though, that Mrs. Vokins patted my hand when nobody\nelse was looking, and said: \"Oh, my dear Mr. Bob, I wish it had been\nyou! You was always the one I liked the best.\" For that, in view of\nevery circumstance, was humorous, and hurt as only humour can.\n\nSo in requital, on the following morning, I mailed to Mrs. Risby some\nverses. This sounds a trifle like burlesque; but Elena had always a sort\nof superstitious reverence for the fact that I \"wrote things.\" It would\nnot matter at all that the verses were abominable; indeed, Elena would\nnever discover this; she would simply set about devising an excellent\nreason for not showing them to anybody, and would consider Warwick\nRisby, if only for a moment, in the light of a person who, whatever his\nundeniable merits, had neither the desire nor the ability to write\n\"poetry.\" And, though it was hideously petty, this was precisely what I\ndesired her to do.\n\nSo I dispatched to her a sonnet-sequence which I had originally\nplagiarized from the French of Theodore Passerat in honour of Stella. I\nloathed sending Stella's verses to anyone else, somehow; but, after all,\nmy one deterrent was merely a romantic notion; and there was not time to\ncompose a new set. Moreover, \"your eyes are blue, your speech is\ngracious, but you are not she; and I am older,--and changed how\nutterly!--I am no longer I, you are not you,\" and so on, was absolutely\nappropriate. And Elena most undoubtedly knew nothing of Theodore\nPasserat. And Stella, being dead, could never know what I had done.\n\nSo I sent the verses, with a few necessitated alterations, to the\naddress of Mrs. Warwick Risby.\n\n\n 5\n\nI had within the week, an unsigned communication which, for a long while\nafterward, I did not comprehend. It was the photograph of an infant,\nwith the photographer's address scratched from the cardboard and without\nof course any decipherable postmark; and upon the back of the thing was\nwritten: \"His has been the summer air, and the sunshine, and the\nflowers; and gentle ears have listened to him, and gentle eyes have been\nupon him. Let others eat his honey that please, so that he has had his\nmorsel and his song.\"\n\nI thought it was a joke of some sort.\n\nThen it occurred to me that this might be--somehow--Elena's answer. It\nwas an interpretation which probably appealed to the Supernal\nAristophanes.\n\n\n\n\n23.\n\n_He Reviles Destiny and Climbs a Wall_\n\n\nBut now the spring was come again, and, as always at this season, I was\npricked with vague longings to have done with roofs and paven places. I\nwanted to be in the open. I think I wanted to fall in love with\nsomebody, and thereby somewhat to prolong the daily half-minute,\nimmediately after awakening in the morning, during which I did not think\nabout Elena Risby.\n\nI was bored in Lichfield. For nothing of much consequence seemed, as I\nyawned over the morning paper, to be happening anywhere. The Illinois\nLegislature had broken up in a free fight, a British square had been\nbroken in Somaliland, and at the Aqueduct track Alado had broken his\njockey's neck. A mob had chased a negro up Broadway: Russia had demanded\nthat China cede the sovereignty of Manchuria; and Dr. Lyman Abbott was\nexplaining why the notion of equal suffrage had been abandoned finally\nby thinking people.\n\nSuch negligible matters contributed not at all to the comfort or the\ndiscomfort of Robert Etheridge Townsend; and I was pricked with vague\nsweet longings to have done with roofs and paven places. If only I\npossessed a country estate, a really handsome Manor or a Grange, I was\nreflecting as I looked over the \"Social Items,\" and saw that Miss\nHugonin and Colonel Hugonin had re-opened Selwoode for the summer\nmonths....\n\nSo I decided I would go to Gridlington, whither Peter Blagden had\nforgotten to invite me. He was extremely glad to see me, though, to do\nhim justice. For Peter--by this time the inheritor of his unlamented\nuncle's estate,--had, very properly, developed gout, which is, I take\nit, the time-honoured appendage of affluence and, so to speak, its\ntrade-mark; and was, for all his wealth, unable to get up and down the\nstairs of his fine house without, as we will delicately word it, the\ndisplay and, at times, the overtaxing of a copious vocabulary.\n\n\n 2\n\nI was at Gridlington entirely comfortable. It was spring, to begin with,\nand out of doors in spring you always know, at twenty-five, that\nsomething extremely pleasant is about to happen, and that She is quite\nprobably around the very next turn of the lane.\n\nMoreover, there was at Gridlington a tiny private garden which had once\nbeen the recreation of Peter Blagden's aunt (dead now twelve years ago),\nand which had remained untended since her cosseting; and I in nature\ntook charge of it.\n\nThere was in the place a wilding peach-tree, which I artistically sawed\ninto shape and pruned and grafted, and painted all those profitable\nwounds with tar; and I grew to love it, just as most people do their\nchildren, because it was mine. And Peter, who is a person of no\nsensibility, wanted to ring for a servant one night, when there was a\nhint of frost and I had started out to put a bucket of water under my\ntree to protect it. I informed him that he was irrevocably dead to all\nthe nobler sentiments, and went to the laundry and got a wash-tub.\n\nPeter was not infrequently obtuse. He would contend, for instance, that\nit was absurd for any person to get so gloriously hot and dirty while\nsetting out plants, when that person objected to having a flower in the\nsame room. For Peter could not understand that a cut flower is a dead\nor, at best, a dying thing, and therefore to considerate people is just\nso much abhorrent carrion; and denied it would be really quite as\nrational to decorate your person or your dinner table with the severed\nheads of chickens as with those of daffodils.\n\n\"But that is only because you are not particularly bright,\" I told him.\n\"Oh, I suppose you can't help it. But why make _all_ the actions of your\nlife so foolish? What good do you get out of having the gout, for\ninstance?\"\n\nWhereupon Mr. Blagden desired to be informed if I considered those\nwith-various-adjectives-accompanied twinges in that qualified foot to be\na source of personal pleasure to the owner of the very-extensively-hiatused\nfoot. In which case, Mr. Blagden felt at liberty to express his opinion of\nmy intellectual attainments, which was of an uncomplimentary nature.\n\n\"Because, you know,\" I pursued, equably, \"you wouldn't have the gout if\nyou did not habitually overeat yourself and drink more than is good for\nyou. In consequence, here you are at thirty-two with a foot the same\ngeneral size and shape as a hayrick, only rather less symmetrical, and\nquite unable to attend to the really serious business of life, which is\nto present me to the heiress. It is a case of vicarious punishment which\nstrikes me as extremely unfair. You have made of your stomach a god,\nPeter, and I am the one to suffer for it. You have made of your\nstomach,\" I continued, venturing aspiringly into metaphor, \"a brazen\nMoloch, before which you are now calmly preparing to immolate my\nprospects in life. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Peter!\"\n\nMr. Blagden's next observation was describable as impolite.\n\n\"Fate, too,\" I lamented, in a tragic voice, \"appears to have entered\ninto this nefarious conspiracy. Here, not two miles away, is one of the\ngreatest heiresses in America,--clever, I am told, beautiful, I am sure,\nfor I have yet to discover a woman who sees anything in the least\nattractive about her,--and, above all, with the Woods millions at her\ndisposal. Why, Peter, Margaret Hugonin is the woman I have been looking\nfor these last three years. She is, to a hair, the sort of woman I have\nalways intended to make unhappy. And I can't even get a sight of her!\nHere are you, laid up with the gout, and unable to help me; and yonder\nis the heiress, making a foolish pretence at mourning for the old\ncurmudgeon who left her all that money, and declining to meet people.\nOh, but she is a shiftless woman, Peter! At this very moment she might\nbe getting better acquainted with me; at this very moment, Peter, I\nmight be explaining to her in what points she is utterly and entirely\ndifferent from all the other women I have ever known. And she prefers to\nimmure herself in Selwoode, with no better company than her father, that\nungodly old retired colonel, and a she-cousin, somewhere on the\nundiscussable side of forty--when she might be engaging me in amorous\ndalliance! That Miss Hugonin is a shiftless woman, I tell you! And\nFate--oh, but Fate, too, is a vixenish jade!\" I cried, and shook my fist\nunder the nose of an imaginary Lachesis.\n\n\"You appear,\" said Peter, drily, \"to be unusually well-informed as to\nwhat is going on at Selwoode.\"\n\n\"You flatter me,\" I answered, as with proper modesty. \"You must remember\nthat there are maids at Selwoode. You must remember that my man Byam,\nis--and will be until that inevitable day when he will attempt to\nblackmail me, and I shall kill him in the most lingering fashion I can\nthink of,--that Byam is, I say, something of a diplomatist.\"\n\nMr. Blagden regarded me with disapproval.\n\n\"So you've been sending your nigger cousin over to Selwoode to spy for\nyou! You're a damn cad, you know, Bob,\" he pensively observed. \"Now most\npeople think that when you carry on like a lunatic you're simply acting\non impulse. I don't. I believe you plan it out a week ahead. I sometimes\nthink you are the most adroit and unblushing looker-out for number one I\never knew; and I can't for the life of me understand why I don't turn\nyou out of doors.\"\n\n\"I don't know where you picked up your manners,\" said I, reflectively,\n\"but it must have been in devilish low company. I would cut your\nacquaintance, Peter, if I could afford it.\" Then I fell to pacing up and\ndown the floor. \"I incline, as you have somewhat grossly suggested, to a\ncertain favouritism among the digits. And why the deuce shouldn't I? A\nfortune is the only thing I need. I have good looks, you know, of a\nsort; ah, I'm not vain, but both my glass and a number of women have\nbeen kind enough to reassure me on this particular point. And that I\nhave a fair amount of wits my creditors will attest, who have lived\npromise-crammed for the last year or two, feeding upon air like\nchameleons. Then I have birth,--not that good birth ensures anything but\nbad habits though, for you will observe that, by some curious freak of\nnature, an old family-tree very seldom produces anything but wild oats.\nAnd, finally, I have position. I can introduce my wife into the best\nsociety; ah, yes, you may depend upon it, Peter, she will have the\nprivilege of meeting the very worst and stupidest and silliest people in\nthe country on perfectly equal terms. You will perceive, then, that the\none desirable thing I lack is wealth. And this I shall naturally expect\nmy wife to furnish. So, the point is settled, and you may give me a\ncigarette.\"\n\nPeter handed me the case, with a snort. \"You are a hopelessly conceited\nass,\" Mr. Blagden was pleased to observe, \"for otherwise you would have\nlearned, by this, that you'll, most likely, never have the luck of\nCharteris, and land a woman who will take it as a favour that you let\nher pay your bills. God knows you've angled for enough of 'em!\"\n\n\"You are painfully coarse, Peter,\" I pointed out, with a sigh. \"Indeed,\nyour general lack of refinement might easily lead one to think you owed\nyour millions to your own thrifty industry, or some equally unpleasant\nattribute, rather than to your uncle's very commendable and lucrative\ninnovation in the line of--well, I remember it was something extremely\nindigestible, but, for the moment, I forget whether it was steam-reapers\nor a new sort of pickle. Yes, in a great many respects, you are\nhopelessly parvenuish. This cigarette-case, for instance--studded with\ndiamonds and engraved with a monogram big enough for a coach-door! Why,\nPeter, it simply reeks with the ostentation of honestly acquired\nwealth,--and with very good tobacco, too, by the way. I shall take it,\nfor I am going for a walk, and I haven't any of my own. And some day I\nshall pawn this jewelled abortion, Peter,--pawn it for much fine gold;\nand upon the proceeds I shall make merriment for myself and for my\nfriends.\" And I pocketed the case.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" Peter growled, \"but you needn't try to change\nthe subject. You know you _have_ angled after any number of rich women\nwho have had sense enough, thank God, to refuse you. You didn't use to\nbe--but now you're quite notoriously good-for-nothing.\"\n\n\"It is the one blemish,\" said I, sweetly, \"upon an otherwise perfect\ncharacter. And it is true,\" I continued, after an interval of\nmeditation, \"that I have, in my time, encountered some very foolish\nwomen. There was, for instance, Elena Barry-Smith, who threw me over for\nWarwick Risby; and Celia Reindan, who had the bad taste to prefer Teddy\nAnstruther; and Rosalind Jemmett, who is, very inconsiderately, going to\nmarry Tom Gelwix, instead of me. These were staggeringly foolish women,\nPeter, but while their taste is bad, their dinners are good, so I have\nremained upon the best of terms with them. They have trodden me under\ntheir feet, but I am the long worm that has no turning. Moreover, you\nare doubtless aware of the axiomatic equality between the fish in the\nsea and those out of it. I hope before long to better my position in\nlife. I hope--Ah, well, that would scarcely interest you. Good morning,\nPeter. And I trust, when I return,\" I added, with chastening dignity,\n\"that you will evince a somewhat more Christian spirit toward the world\nin general, and that your language will be rather less reminiscent of\nthe blood-stained buccaneer of historical fiction.\"\n\n\"You're a grinning buffoon,\" said Peter. \"You're a fat Jack-pudding.\nYou're an ass. Where are you going, anyway?\"\n\n\"I am going,\" said I, \"to the extreme end of Gridlington. Afterward I am\ngoing to climb the wall that stands between Gridlington and Selwoode.\"\n\n\"And after that?\" said Peter.\n\nI gave a gesture. \"Why, after that,\" said I, \"fortune will favour the\nbrave. And I, Peter, am very, very brave.\"\n\nThen I departed, whistling. In view of all my memories it had been\nstrangely droll to worry Peter Blagden into an abuse of marrying for\nmoney. For this was on the twenty-eighth of April, the anniversary of\nthe day that Stella had died, you may remember....\n\n\n 3\n\nAnd a half-hour subsequently, true to my word, I was scaling a ten-foot\nstone wall, thickly overgrown with ivy. At the top of it I paused, and\nsat down to take breath and to meditate, my legs meanwhile bedangling\nover an as flourishing Italian garden as you would wish to see.\n\n\"Now, I wonder,\" I queried, of my soul, \"what will be next? There is a\nvery cheerful uncertainty about what will be next. It may be a\nspring-gun, and it may be a bull-dog, and it may be a susceptible\nheiress. But it is apt to be--No, it isn't,\" I amended, promptly; \"it is\ngoing to be an angel. Or perhaps it is going to be a dream. She can't be\nreal, you know--I am probably just dreaming her. I would be quite\ncertain I was just dreaming her, if this wall were not so humpy and\nuncomfortable. For it stands to reason, I would not be fool enough to\ndream of such unsympathetic iron spikes as I am sitting on.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are not aware,\" hazarded a soprano voice, \"that this is\nprivate property?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" said I, very placidly; \"on the contrary I was just thinking\nit must be heaven. And I am tolerably certain,\" I commented further, in\nmy soul, \"that you are one of the more influential seraphim.\"\n\nThe girl had lifted her brows. She sat upon a semi-circular stone bench,\nsome twenty feet from the wall, and had apparently been reading, for a\nbook lay open in her lap. She now inspected me, with a sort of languid\nwonder in her eyes, and I returned the scrutiny with unqualified\napproval in mine.\n\nAnd in this I had reason. The heiress of Selwoode was eminently good to\nlook upon.\n\n\n\n\n24.\n\n_He Reconciles Sentiment and Reason_\n\n\nSo I regarded her for a rather lengthy interval, considering meanwhile,\nwith an immeasurable content how utterly and entirely impossible it\nwould always be to describe her.\n\nClearly, it would be out of the question to trust to words, however\nchoicely picked, for, upon inspection, there was a delightful ambiguity\nabout every one of this girl's features that defied such idiotic\nmakeshifts. Her eyes, for example, I noted with a faint thrill of\nsurprise, just escaped being brown by virtue of an amber glow they had;\nwhat colour, then, was I conscientiously to call them?\n\nAnd her hair I found a bewildering, though pleasing, mesh of shadow and\nsunlight, all made up of multitudinous graduations of some anonymous\ncolour that seemed to vary with the light you chanced to see it in,\nthrough the whole gamut of bronze and chestnut and gold; and where,\npray, in the bulkiest lexicon, in the very weightiest thesaurus, was I\nto find the adjective which could, if but in desperation, be applied to\nhair like that without trenching on sacrilege? ... For it was spring,\nyou must remember, and I was twenty-five.\n\nSo that in my appraisal, you may depend upon it, her lips were quickly\npassed over as a dangerous topic, and were dismissed with the mental\nstatement that they were red and not altogether unattractive. Whereas\nher cheeks baffled me for a time,--but always with a haunting sense of\nfamiliarity--till I had, at last, discovered they reminded me of those\nlittle tatters of cloud that sometimes float about the setting\nsun,--those irresolute wisps which cannot quite decide whether to be\npink or white, and waver through their tiny lives between the\ntwo colours.\n\n\n 2\n\nTo this effect, then, I discoursed with my soul, what time I sat upon\nthe wall-top and smiled and kicked my heels to and fro among the ivy. By\nand by, though, the girl sighed.\n\n\"You are placing me in an extremely unpleasant position,\" she\ncomplained, as if wearily. \"Would you mind returning to your sanatorium\nand allowing me to go on reading? For I am interested in my book, and I\ncan't possibly go on in any comfort so long as you elect to perch up\nthere like Humpty-Dumpty, and grin like seven dozen Cheshire cats.\"\n\n\"Now, that,\" I spoke, in absent wise, \"is but another instance of the\nwidely prevalent desire to have me serve as scapegoat for the sins of\nall humanity. I am being blamed now for sitting on top of this wall. One\nwould think I wanted to sit here. One would actually think,\" I cried,\nand raised my eyes to heaven, \"that sitting on the very humpiest kind of\niron spikes was my favorite form of recreation! No,--in the interests of\njustice,\" I continued, and fell into a milder tone, \"I must ask you to\nplace the blame where it more rightfully belongs. The injuries which are\nwithin the moment being inflicted on my sensitive nature, and,\nincidentally, upon my not overstocked wardrobe, I am willing to pass\nover. But the claims of justice are everywhere paramount. Miss Hugonin,\nand Miss Hugonin alone, is responsible for my present emulation of\nMohammed's coffin, and upon that responsibility I am compelled\nto insist.\"\n\n\"May one suggest,\" she queried gently, \"that you are\nprobably--mistaken?\"\n\nI sketched a bow. \"Recognising your present point of view,\" said I,\ngallantly, \"I thank you for the kindly euphemism. But may one allowably\ndemonstrate the fallacy of this same point of view? I thank you: for\nsilence, I am told, is proverbially equal to assent. I am, then, one\nRobert Townsend, by birth a gentleman, by courtesy an author, by\ninclination an idler, and by lucky chance a guest of Mr. Peter Blagden,\nwhose flourishing estate extends indefinitely yonder to the rear of my\ncoat-tails. My hobby chances to be gardening. I am a connoisseur, an\nadmirer, a devotee of gardens. It is, indeed, hereditary among the\nTownsends; a love for gardens runs in our family just as a love for gin\nruns in less favoured races. It is with us an irresistible passion. The\nvery founder of our family--one Adam, whom you may have heard of,--was a\ngardener. Owing to the unfortunate loss of his position, the family\nsince then has sunken somewhat in the world; but time and poverty alike\nhave proven powerless against our horticultural tastes and botanical\ninclinations. And then,\" cried I, with a flourish, \"and then, what\nfollows logically?\"\n\n\"Why, if you are not more careful,\" she languidly made answer, \"I am\nafraid that, owing to the laws of gravitation, a broken neck is what\nfollows logically.\"\n\n\"You are a rogue,\" I commented, in my soul, \"and I like you all the\nbetter for it.\"\n\nAloud, I stated: \"What follows is that we can no more keep away from a\ncreditable sort of garden than a moth can from a lighted candle.\nConsider, then, my position. Here am I on one side of the wall, and with\nmy peach-tree, to be sure--but on the other side is one of the most\nfamous masterpieces of formal gardening in the whole country. Am I to\nblame if I succumb to the temptation? Surely not,\" I argued; \"for surely\nto any fair-minded person it will be at once apparent that I am brought\nto my present very uncomfortable position upon the points of these very\nhumpy iron spikes by a simple combination of atavism and\ninjustice,--atavism because hereditary inclination draws me irresistibly\nto the top of the wall, and injustice because Miss Hugonin's perfectly\nunreasonable refusal to admit visitors prevents my coming any farther.\nSurely, that is at once apparent?\"\n\nBut now the girl yielded to my grave face, and broke into a clear,\nrippling carol of mirth. She laughed from the chest, this woman. And\nperched in insecure discomfort on my wall, I found time to rejoice that\nI had finally discovered that rarity of rarities, a woman who neither\ngiggles nor cackles, but has found the happy mean between these two\nabominations, and knows how to laugh.\n\n\"I have heard of you, Mr. Townsend,\" she said at last. \"Oh, yes, I have\nheard a deal of you. And I remember now that I never heard you were\nsuspected of sanity.\"\n\n\"Common-sense,\" I informed her, from my pedestal, \"is confined to that\ndecorous class of people who never lose either their tempers or their\numbrellas. Now, I haven't any temper to speak of--or not at least in the\npresence of ladies,--and, so far, I have managed to avoid laying aside\nanything whatever for a rainy day; so that it stands to reason I must\npossess uncommon sense.\"\n\n\"If that is the case,\" said the girl \"you will kindly come down from\nthat wall and attempt to behave like a rational being.\"\n\nI was down--as the phrase runs,--in the twinkling of a bed-post. On\nwhich side of the wall, I leave you to imagine.\n\n\"--For I am sure,\" the girl continued, \"that I--that Margaret, I should\nsay,--would not object in the least to your seeing the gardens, since\nthey interest you so tremendously. I'm Avis Beechinor, you know,--Miss\nHugonin's cousin. So, if you like, we will consider that a proper\nintroduction, Mr. Townsend, and I will show you the gardens, if--if you\nreally care to see them.\"\n\nMy face, I must confess, had fallen slightly. Up to this moment, I had\nnot a suspicion but that it was Miss Hugonin I was talking to: and I now\nreconsidered, with celerity, the information Byam had brought me\nfrom Selwoode.\n\n\"For, when I come to think of it,\" I reflected, \"he simply said she was\nolder than Miss Hugonin. I embroidered the tale so glibly for Peter's\nbenefit that I was deceived by my own ornamentations. I had looked for\ncorkscrew ringlets and false teeth a-gleam like a new bath-tub in Miss\nHugonin's cousin,--not an absolutely, supremely, inexpressibly\nunthinkable beauty like this!\" I cried, in my soul. \"Older! Why, good\nLord, Miss Hugonin must be an infant in arms!\"\n\nBut my audible discourse was prefaced with an eloquent gesture. \"If I'd\ncare!\" I said. \"Haven't I already told you I was a connoisseur in\ngardens? Why, simply look, Miss Beechinor!\" I exhorted her, and threw\nout my hands in a large pose of admiration. \"Simply regard those\nyew-hedges, and parterres, and grassy amphitheatres, and palisades, and\nstatues, and cascades, and everything--_everything_ that goes to make a\nformal garden the most delectable sight in the world! Simply feast your\neyes upon those orderly clipped trees and the fantastic patterns those\nflowers are laid out in! Why, upon my word, it looks as if all four\nbooks of Euclid had suddenly burst into blossom! And you ask me if I\nwould _care_! Ah, it is evident _you_ are not a connoisseur in gardens,\nMiss Beechinor!\"\n\nAnd I had started on my way into this one, when the girl stopped me.\n\n\"This must be yours,\" she said. \"You must have spilled it coming over\nthe wall, Mr. Townsend.\"\n\nIt was Peter's cigarette-case.\n\n\"Why, dear me, yes!\" I assented, affably. \"Do you know, now, I would\nhave been tremendously sorry to lose that? It is a sort of present--an\nunbirthday present from a quite old friend.\"\n\nShe turned it over in her hand.\n\n\"It's very handsome,\" she marvelled. \"Such a pretty monogram! Does it\nstand for Poor Idiot Boy?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said I. \"P.I.B., you mean? No, that stands for Perfectly\nImmaculate Behaviour. My friend gave it to me because, he said, I was so\ngood. And--oh, well, he added a few things to that,--partial sort of a\nfriend, you know,--and, really--Why, really, Miss Beechinor, it would\nembarrass me to tell you what he added,\" I protested, and modestly waved\nthe subject aside.\n\n\"Now that,\" my meditations ran, \"is the absolute truth. Peter did tell\nme I was good. And it really would embarrass me to tell her he added\n'for-nothing.' So, this far, I have been a model of veracity.\"\n\nThen I took the case,--gaining thereby the bliss of momentary contact\nwith a velvet-soft trifle that seemed, somehow, to set my own grosser\nhand a-tingle--and I cried: \"Now, Miss Beechinor, you must show me the\npergola. I am excessively partial to pergolas.\"\n\nAnd in my soul, I wondered what a pergola looked like, and why on earth\nI had been fool enough to waste the last three days in bedeviling Peter,\nand how under the broad canopy of heaven I could ever have suffered from\nthe delusion that I had seen a really adorable woman before to-day.\n\n\n 3\n\nBut, \"She is entirely too adorable,\" I reasoned with myself, some\nthree-quarters of an hour later. \"In fact, I regard it as positively\ninconsiderate in any impecunious young person to venture to upset me in\nthe way she has done. Why, my heart is pounding away inside me like a\ntrip-hammer, and I am absolutely light-headed with good-will and charity\nand benevolent intentions toward the entire universe! Oh, Avis, Avis,\nyou know you hadn't any right to put me in this insane state of mind!\"\n\nI was, at this moment, retracing my steps toward the spot where I had\nclimbed the wall between Gridlington and Selwoode, but I paused now to\noutline a reproachful gesture in the direction from which I came.\n\n\"What do you mean by having such a name?\" I queried, sadly. \"Avis! Why,\nit is the very soul of music, clear, and sweet and as insistent as a\nbird-call, an unforgettable lyric in four letters! It is just the sort\nof name a fellow cannot possibly forget. Why couldn't you have been\nnamed Polly or Lena or Margaret, or something commonplace like that,\nAvis--dear?\"\n\nAnd the juxtaposition of these words appealing to my sense of euphony, I\nrepeated it, again and again, each time with a more relishing gusto.\n\"Avis dear! dear Avis! dear, _dear_ Avis!\" I experimented. \"Why, each\none is more hopelessly unforgettable than the other! Oh, Avis dear, why\nare you so absolutely and entirely unforgettable all around? Why do you\nripple all your words together in that quaint fashion till it sounds\nlike a brook discoursing? Why did you crinkle up your eyes when I told\nyou that as yet unbotanised flower was a _Calycanthus arithmelicus_? And\nwhy did you pout at me, Avis dear? A fellow finds it entirely too hard\nto forget things like that. And, oh, dear Avis, if you only knew what\nnearly happened when you pouted!\"\n\nI had come to the wall by this, but again I paused to lament.\n\n\"It is very inconsiderate of her, very thoughtless indeed. She might at\nleast have asked my permission, before upsetting my plans in life. I had\nfirmly intended to marry a rich woman, and now I am forming all sorts of\npreposterous notions--\"\n\nThen, on the bench where I had first seen her, I perceived a book. It\nwas the iron-gray book she had been reading when I interrupted her, and\nI now picked it up with a sort of reverence. I regarded it as an\nextremely lucky book.\n\nSubsequently, \"Good Lord!\" said I, aloud, \"what luck!\"\n\nFor between the pages of Justus Miles Forman's _Journey's End_--serving\nas a book-mark, according to a not infrequent shiftless feminine\nfashion,--lay a handkerchief. It was a flimsy, inadequate trifle,\nfringed with a tiny scallopy black border; and in one corner the letters\nM. E. A. H., all askew, contorted themselves into any number of\nflourishes and irrelevant tendrils.\n\n\"Now M. E. A. H. does not stand by any stretch of the imagination for\nAvis Beechinor. Whereas it fits Margaret Elizabeth Anstruther Hugonin\nuncommonly well. I wonder now--?\"\n\nI wondered for a rather lengthy interval.\n\n\"So Byam was right, after all. And Peter was right, too. Oh, Robert\nEtheridge Townsend, your reputation must truly be malodorous, when at\nyour approach timid heiresses seek shelter under an alias! 'I have heard\na deal of you, Mr. Townsend'--ah, yes, she had heard. She thought I\nwould make love to her out of hand, I suppose, because she was\nwealthy--\"\n\nI presently flung back my head and laughed.\n\n\"Eh, well! I will let no sordid considerations stand in the way of my\ntrue interests. I will marry this Margaret Hugonin even though she is\nrich. You have begun the comedy, my lady, and I will play it to the end.\nYes, I fell honestly in love with you when I thought you were nobody in\nparticular. So I am going to marry this Margaret Hugonin if she will\nhave me; and if she won't, I am going to commit suicide on her\ndoor-step, with a pathetic little note in my vest-pocket forgiving her\nin the most noble and wholesale manner for irrevocably blighting a\nfuture so rich in promise. Yes, that is exactly what I am going to do if\nshe does not appreciate her wonderful good fortune. And if she'll have\nme--why, I wouldn't change places with the Pope of Rome or the Czar of\nall the Russias! Ah, no, not I! for I prefer, upon the whole, to be\nimmeasurably, and insanely, and unreasonably, and unadulteratedly happy.\nWhy, but just to think of an adorable girl like that having so\nmuch money!\"\n\nAll in all, my meditations were incoherent but very pleasurable.\n\n\n\n\n25.\n\n_He Advances in the Attack on Selwoode_\n\n\n\"Well?\" said Peter.\n\n\"Well?\" said I.\n\n\"What's the latest quotation on heiresses?\" Mr. Blagden demanded. \"Was\nshe cruel, my boy, or was she kind? Did she set the dog on you or have\nyou thrashed by her father? I fancy both, for your present hilarity is\nsuggestive of a gentleman in the act of attendance on his own funeral.\"\nAnd Peter laughed, unctuously, for his gout slumbered.\n\n\"His attempts at wit,\" I reflectively confided to my wine-glass, \"while\ndoubtless amiably intended, are, to his well-wishers, painful. I\ndaresay, though, he doesn't know it. We must, then, smile indulgently\nupon the elephantine gambols of what he is pleased to describe as his\nintellect.\"\n\n\"Now, that,\" Peter pointed out, \"is not what I would term a courteous\nmethod of discussing a man at his own table. You are damn disagreeable\nthis morning, Bob. So I know, of course, that you have come another\ncropper in your fortune-hunting.\"\n\n\"Peter,\" said I, in admiration, \"your sagacity at times is almost human!\nI have spent a most enjoyable day, though,\" I continued, idly. \"I have\nbeen communing with Nature, Peter. She is about her spring-cleaning in\nthe woods yonder, and everywhere I have seen traces of her getting\nthings fixed for the summer. I have seen the sky, which was washed\novernight, and the sun, which has evidently been freshly enamelled. I\nhave seen the new leaves as they swayed and whispered over your\nextensive domains, with the fret of spring alert in every sap cell. I\nhave seen the little birds as they hopped among said leaves and\ncommented upon the scarcity of worms. I have seen the buxom flowers as\nthey curtsied and danced above your flower-beds like a miniature\ncomic-opera chorus. And besides that--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Peter, with a grin, \"and besides that?\"\n\n\"And besides that,\" said I, firmly, \"I have seen nothing.\"\n\nAnd internally I appraised this bloated Peter Blagden, and reflected\nthat this was the man whom Stella had loved; and I appraised myself, and\nremembered that this had been the boy who once loved Stella. For, as I\nhave said, it was the twenty-eighth of April, the day that Stella had\ndied, two years ago.\n\n\n 2\n\nThe next morning I discoursed with my soul, what time I sat upon the\nwall-top and smiled and kicked my heels to and fro among the ivy.\n\n\"For, in spite of appearances,\" I debated with myself, \"it is barely\npossible that the handkerchief was not hers. She may have borrowed it or\nhave got it by mistake, somehow. In which case, it is only reasonable to\nsuppose that she will miss it, and ask me if I saw it; on the contrary,\nif the handkerchief is hers, she will naturally understand, when I\nreturn the book without it, that I have feloniously detained this airy\ngewgaw as a souvenir, as, so to speak, a _gage d'amour_. And, in that\nevent, she ought to be very much pleased and a bit embarrassed; and she\nwill preserve upon the topic of handkerchiefs a maidenly silence. Do you\nknow, Robert Etheridge Townsend, there is about you the making of a very\nfine logician?\"\n\nThen I consulted my watch, and subsequently grimaced. \"It is also barely\npossible,\" said I, \"that Margaret may not come at all. In which\ncase--Margaret! Now, isn't that a sweet name? Isn't it the very sweetest\nname in the world? Now, really, you know, it is queer her being named\nMargaret--extraordinarily queer,--because Margaret has always been my\nfavourite woman's name. I daresay, unbeknownst to myself, I am a bit of\na prophet.\"\n\n\n 3\n\nBut she did come. She was very much surprised to see me.\n\n\"You!\" she said, with a gesture which was practically tantamount to\ndisbelief. \"Why, how extraordinary!\"\n\n\"You rogue!\" I commented, internally: \"you know it is the most natural\nthing in the world.\" Aloud I stated: \"Why, yes, I happened to notice you\nforgot your book yesterday, so I dropped in--or, to be more accurate,\nclimbed up,--to return it.\"\n\nShe reached for it. Our hands touched, with the usual result to my\npulses. Also, there were the customary manual tinglings.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" was her observation, \"for I am wondering which one\nof the two he will marry.\"\n\n\"Forman tells me he has no notion, himself.\"\n\n\"Oh, then you know Justus Miles Forman! How nice! I think his stories\nare just splendid, especially the way his heroes talk to photographs and\nhandkerchiefs and dead flowers--\"\n\nAfterward she opened the book, and turned over its pages expectantly,\nand flushed a proper shade of pink, and said nothing.\n\nAnd then, and not till then, my heart consented to resume its normal\nfunctions. And then, also, \"These iron spikes--\" said its owner.\n\n\"Yes?\" she queried, innocently.\n\n\"--so humpy,\" I complained.\n\n\"Are they?\" said she. \"Why, then, how silly of you to continue to sit on\nthem!\"\n\nThe result of this comment was that we were both late for luncheon.\n\n\n 4\n\nBy a peculiar coincidence, at twelve o'clock the following day, I\nhappened to be sitting on the same wall at the same spot. Peter said at\nluncheon it was a queer thing that some people never could manage to be\non time for their meals.\n\nI fancy we can all form a tolerably accurate idea of what took place\nduring the next day or so.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to retail our conversations. We gossiped of\nsimple things. We talked very little; and, when we did talk, the most\nambitiously preambled sentences were apt to result in nothing more\nprodigious than a wave of the hand, and a pause, and, not infrequently,\na heightened complexion. Altogether, then, it was not oppressively wise\nor witty talk, but it was eminently satisfactory to its makers.\n\nAs when, on the third morning, I wished to sit by Margaret on the bench,\nand she declined to invite me to descend from the wall.\n\n\"On the whole,\" said she, \"I prefer you where you are; like all\npicturesque ruins, you are most admirable at a little distance.\"\n\n\"Ruins!\"--and, indeed, I was not yet twenty-six,--\"I am a comparatively\nyoung man.\"\n\nAs a concession, \"In consideration of your past, you are tolerably well\npreserved.\"\n\n\"--and I am not a new brand of marmalade, either.\"\n\n\"No, for that comes in glass jars; whereas, Mr. Townsend, I have heard,\nis more apt to figure in family ones.\"\n\n\"A pun, Miss Beechinor, is the base coinage of conversation tendered\nonly by the mentally dishonest.\"\n\n\"--Besides, one can never have enough of marmalade.\"\n\n\"I trust they give you a sufficiency of it in the nursery?\"\n\n\"Dear me, you have no idea how admirably that paternal tone sits upon\nyou! You would make an excellent father, Mr. Townsend. You really ought\nto adopt someone. I wish you would adopt _me_, Mr. Townsend.\"\n\nI said I had other plans for her. Discreetly, she forbore to ask what\nthey were.\n\n\n 5\n\n\"Avis--\"\n\n\"You must not call me that.\"\n\n\"Why not? It's your name, isn't it\"\n\n\"Yes,--to my friends.\"\n\n\"Aren't we friends--Avis?\"\n\n\"We! We have not known each other long enough, Mr. Townsend.\"\n\n\"Oh, what's the difference? We are going to be friends, aren't\nwe--Avis?\"\n\n\"Why--why, I am sure I don't know.\"\n\n\"Gracious gravy, what an admirable colour you have, Avis! Well,--I know.\nAnd I can inform you, quite confidentially, Avis, that we are not going\nto be--. friends. We are going to be--\"\n\n\"We are going to be late for luncheon,\" said she, in haste.\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Townsend.\"\n\n\n 6\n\nYet, the very next day, paradoxically enough, she told me:\n\n\"I shall always think of you as a very, very dear friend. But it is\nquite impossible we should ever be anything else.\"\n\n\"And why, Avis?\"\n\n\"Because--\"\n\n\"That\"--after an interval--\"strikes me as rather a poor reason. So,\nsuppose we say this June?\"\n\nAnother interval.\n\n\"Well, Avis?\"\n\n\"Dear me, aren't those roses pretty? I wish you would get me one, Mr.\nTownsend.\"\n\n\"Avis, we are not discussing roses.\"\n\n\"Well, they _are_ pretty.\"\n\n\"Avis!\"--reproachfully.\n\nStill another interval.\n\n\"I--I hardly know.\"\n\n\"Avis!\"--with disappointment.\n\n\"I--I believe--\"\n\n\"Avis!\"--very tenderly.\n\n\"I--I almost think so,--and the horrid man looks as if he thought so,\ntoo!\"\n\nThere was a fourth interval, during which the girl made a complete and\ncareful survey of her shoes.\n\nThen, all in a breath, \"It could not possibly be June, of course, and\nyou must give me until to-morrow to think about November,\" and a sudden\nflutter of skirts.\n\nI returned to Gridlington treading on air.\n\n\n 7\n\nFor I was, by this time, as thoroughly in love as Amadis of Gaul or\nAucassin of Beaucaire or any other hero of romance you may elect\nto mention.\n\nSome two weeks earlier I would have scoffed at the notion of such a\nthing coming to pass; and I could have demonstrated, logically enough,\nthat it was impossible for Robert Etheridge Townsend, with his keen\nknowledge of the world and of the innumerable vanities and whims of\nwomankind, ever again to go the way of all flesh. But the problem, like\nthe puzzle of the Eleatic philosophers, had solved itself. \"Achilles\ncannot catch the tortoise,\" but he does. It was impossible for me to\nfall uncomfortably deep in love--but I had done so.\n\nAnd it pricked my conscience, too, that Margaret should not know I was\naware of her identity. But she had chosen to play the comedy to the end,\nand in common with the greater part of trousered humanity, I had, after\nall, no insuperable objection to a rich wife; though, to do me justice,\nI rarely thought of her, now, as Margaret Hugonin the heiress, but\nconsidered her, in a more comprehensive fashion, as the one woman in the\nuniverse whose perfections triumphantly overpeered the skyiest heights\nof preciosity.\n\n\n\n\n26.\n\n\n_He Assists in the Diversion of Birds_\n\nWe met, then, in the clear May morning, with what occult trepidations I\ncannot say. You may depend upon it, though, we had our emotions.\n\nAnd about us, spring was marshaling her pageant, and from divers nooks,\nthe weather-stained nymphs and fauns regarded us in candid, if\npreoccupied, appraisement; and above us, the clipped ilex trees were\nabout a knowing conference. As for the birds, they were discussing us\nwithout any reticence whatever, for, more favoured of chance than\nimperial Solomon, they have been the confidants in any number of such\naffairs, and regard the way of a man with a maid as one of the most\nmatter-of-fact occurrences in the world.\n\n\"Here is he! here is she!\" they shrilled. \"See how they meet, see how\nthey greet! Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet, to meet in the spring!\" And that we\ntwo would immediately set to nest-building, they considered a foregone\nconclusion.\n\n\n 2\n\nI had taken both her firm, warm hands in salutation, and held them, for\na breathing-space, between my own. And my own hands seemed to me two\nvery gross, and hulking, and raw, and red monstrosities, in contrast\nwith their dimpled captives, and my hands appeared, also, to shake\nunnecessarily.\n\n\"Now, in a moment,\" said I, \"I am going to ask you something very\nimportant. But, first, I have a confession to make.\"\n\nAnd her glad, shamed eyes bemocked me. \"My lord of Burleigh!\" she softly\nbreathed. \"My liege Cophetua! _My_ king Cophetua! And did you think,\nthen, I was blind?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said I.\n\n\"As if I hadn't known from the first!\" the girl pouted; \"as if I hadn't\nknown from the very first day when you dropped your cigarette case! Ah,\nI had heard of you before, Peter!--of Peter, the misogynist, who was\nashamed to go a-wooing in his proper guise! Was it because you were\nafraid I'd marry you for your money, Peter?--poor, timid Peter! But, oh,\nPeter, Peter, what possessed you to take the name of that notorious\nRobert Townsend?\" she demanded, with uplifted forefinger. \"Couldn't you\nthink of a better one, Peter?--of a more respectable one, Peter? It\nreally is a great relief to call you Peter at last. I've had to try so\nhard to keep from doing it before, Peter.\"\n\nAnd in answer, I made an inarticulate sound.\n\n\"But you were so grave about it,\" the girl went on, happily, \"that I\nalmost thought you were telling the truth, Peter. Then my maid told\nme--I mean, she happened to mention casually that Mr. Townsend's valet\nhad described his master to her as an extraordinarily handsome man. So,\nthen, of course, I knew you were Peter Blagden.\"\n\n\"I perceive,\" said I, reflectively, \"that Byam has been somewhat too\nzealous. I begin to suspect, also, that kitchen-gossip is a mischancy\npetard, and rather more than apt to hoist the engineer who employs it.\nSo, you thought I was Peter Blagden,--the rich Peter Blagden? Ah, yes!\"\n\nNow the birds were caroling on a wager. \"Ah, sweet! what is sweeter?\"\nthey sang. \"Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet, to meet in the spring.\"\n\nBut the girl gave a wordless cry at sight of the change in my face. \"Oh,\nhow dear of you to care so much! I didn't mean that you were _ugly_,\nPeter. I just meant you are so big and--and so like the baby that they\nprobably have on the talcum-powder boxes in Brobdingnag--\"\n\n\"Because I happen to be really Robert Townsend--the notorious Robert\nEtheridge Townsend,\" I continued, with a smile. \"I am sorry you were\ndeceived by the cigarette-case. I remember now; I borrowed it from\nPeter. What I meant to confess was that I have known all along you were\nMargaret Hugonin.\"\n\n\"But I'm not,\" the girl said, in bewilderment. \"Why--Why I _told_ you I\nwas Avis Beechinor.\"\n\n\"This handkerchief?\" I queried, and took it from my pocket. I had been\nabsurd enough to carry it next to my heart.\n\n\"Oh--!\" And now the tension broke, and her voice leapt to high, shrill,\nhalf-hysterical speaking.\n\n\"I am Avis Beechinor. I am a poor relation, a penniless cousin, a\ndependent, a hanger-on, do you understand? And you--Ah, how--how funny!\nWhy, Margaret _always_ gives me her cast-off finery, the scraps, the\nremnants, the clothes she is tired of, the misfit things,--so that she\nwon't be ashamed of me, so that I may be fairly presentable. She gave me\neight of those handkerchiefs. I meant to pick the monograms out with a\nneedle, you understand, because I haven't any money to buy such\nhandkerchiefs for myself. I remember now,--she gave them to me on that\nday--that first day, and I missed one of them a little later on. Ah,\nhow--how funny!\" she cried, again; \"ah, how very, very funny! No, Mr.\nTownsend, I am not an heiress,--I'm a pauper, a poor relation. No, you\nhave failed again, just as you did with Mrs. Barry-Smith and with Miss\nJemmett, Mr. Townsend. I--I wish you better luck the next time.\"\n\nI must have raised one hand as though in warding off a physical blow.\n\"Don't!\" I said.\n\nAnd all the woman in her leapt to defend me. \"Ah no, ah no!\" she\npleaded, and her hands fell caressingly upon my shoulder; and she raised\na penitent, tear-stained face toward mine; \"ah no, forgive me! I didn't\nmean that altogether. It is different with a man. Of course, you must\nmarry sensibly,--of course you must, Mr. Townsend. It is I who am to\nblame--why, of _course_ it's only I who am to blame. I have encouraged\nyou, I know--\"\n\n\"You haven't! you haven't\" I barked.\n\n\"But, yes,--for I came back that second day because I thought you were\nthe rich Mr. Blagden. I was so tired of being poor, so tired of being\ndependent, that it simply seemed to me I could not stand it for a moment\nlonger. Ah, I tell you, I was tired, tired, tired! I was tired and sick\nand worn out with it all!\"\n\nI did not interrupt her. I was nobly moved; but even then at the back of\nmy mind some being that was not I was taking notes as to this girl, so\nyoung and desirable, and now so like a plaintive child who has been\npunished and does not understand exactly why.\n\n\"Mr. Townsend, you don't know what it means to a girl to be poor!--you\ncan't ever know, because you are only a man. My mother--ah, you don't\nknow the life I have led! You don't know how I have been hawked about,\nand set up for inspection by the men who could afford to pay my price,\nand made to show off my little accomplishments for them, and put through\nmy paces before them like any horse in the market! For we are poor, Mr.\nTownsend,--we are bleakly, hopelessly poor. We are only hangers-on, you\nsee. And ever since I can remember, she has been telling me I must make\na rich marriage--_must_ make a rich marriage--\"\n\nAnd the girl's voice trailed off into silence, and her eyes closed for a\nmoment, and she swayed a little on her feet, so that I caught her by\nboth arms.\n\nBut, presently, she opened her eyes, with a wearied sigh, and presently\nthe two fortune-hunters stared each other in the face.\n\n\"Ah, sweet! what is sweeter?\" sang the birds. \"Can you see, can you see,\ncan you see? It is sweet, sweet, sweet!\" They were extremely gay over\nit, were the birds.\n\nAfter a little, though, I opened my lips, and moistened them two or\nthree times before I spoke. \"Yes,\" said I, \"I think I understand. We\nhave both been hangers-on. But that seems, somehow, a long while ago.\nYes, it was a knave who scaled that wall the first time,--one who needed\nand had earned a kicking from here to Aldebaran. But I think that I\nloved you from the very moment I saw you. Will you marry me, Avis?\"\n\nAnd in her face there was a wonderful and tender change. \"You care for\nme--just me?\" she breathed.\n\n\"Just you,\" I answered, gravely.\n\nAnd I saw the start, and the merest ghost of a shiver which shook her\nbody, as she leaned toward me a little, almost in surrender; but,\nquickly, she laughed.\n\n\"That was very gentlemanly in you,\" she said; \"but, of course, I\nunderstand. Let us part friends, then,--Robert. Even if--if you really\ncared, we couldn't marry. We are too poor.\"\n\n\"Too poor!\" I scoffed,--and my voice was joyous, for I knew now that it\nwas I she loved and not just Peter Blagden's money; \"too _poor_, Avis! I\nam to the contrary, an inordinately rich man, I tell you, for I have\nyour love. Oh you needn't try to deny it. You are heels over head in\nlove with me. And we have made, no doubt, an unsavoury mess of the past;\nbut the future remains to us. We are the earthen pots, you and I, who\nwanted to swim with the brazen ones. Well! they haven't quite smashed\nus, these big, stupid, brazen pots, but they have shown us that they\nhave the power to do it. And so we are going back where we belong--to\nthe poor man's country, Avis,--or, in any event, to the country of those\nGod-fearing, sober and honest folk who earn their bread and, just\noccasionally, a pat of butter to season it.\"\n\nThe world was very beautiful. I knew that I was excellent throughout and\nunconquerable. So I moved more near to her.\n\n\"For you will come with me, won't you, dear? Oh, you won't have quite so\nmany gowns in this new country, Avis, and, may be, not even a horse and\nsurrey of your own; but you will have love, and you will have happiness,\nand, best of all, Avis, you will give a certain very undeserving man his\nchance--his one sole chance--to lead a real man's life. Are you going\nto deny him that chance, Avis?\"\n\nHer gaze read me through and through; and I bore myself a bit proudly\nunder it; and it seemed to me that my heart was filled with love of her,\nand that some sort of new-born manhood in Robert Etheridge Townsend was\nenabling me to meet her big brown eyes unflinchingly.\n\n\"It wouldn't be sensible,\" she wavered.\n\nI laughed at that. \"Sensible! If there is one thing more absurd than\nanother in this very absurd world, it is common-sense. Be sensible and\nyou will be miserable, Avis, not to mention being disliked. Sensible!\nWhy, of course, it is not sensible. It is stark, rank, staring idiocy\nfor us two not to make a profitable investment of, we will say, our\nnatural endowments, when we come to marry. For what will Mrs. Grundy say\nif we don't? Ah, what will she say, indeed? Avis, just between you and\nme, I do not care a double-blank domino what Mrs. Grundy says. You will\nobligingly remember that the car for the Hesperides is in the rear, and\nthat this is the third and last call. And in consequence--will you\nmarry me, Avis?\"\n\nShe gave me her hand frankly, as a man might have done. \"Yes, Robert,\"\nsaid Miss Beechinor, \"and God helping us, we will make something better\nof the future than we have of the past.\"\n\nIn the silence that fell, one might hear the birds. \"Sweet, sweet,\nsweet!\" they twittered. \"Can you see, can you see, can you see? Their\nlips meet. It is sweet, sweet, sweet!\"\n\n\n 3\n\nBut, by and by, she questioned me. \"Are you sure--quite sure,\" she\nqueried, wistfully, \"that you wouldn't rather have me Margaret Hugonin,\nthe heiress?\"\n\nI raised a deprecatory hand. \"Avis!\" I reproached her; \"Avis, Avis, how\nlittle you know me! That was the solitary fly in the amber,--that I\nthought I was to marry a woman named Margaret. For I am something of a\nconnoisseur in nomenclature, and Margaret has always--_always_--been my\npet detestation in the way of names.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a child you are!\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n27.\n\n_He Calls, and Counsels, and Considers_\n\n\n\"I am now\" said I, in my soul, \"quite immeasurably, and insanely, and\nunreasonably, and unadulteratedly happy. Why, of course I am.\"\n\nThis statement was advanced just two weeks later than the events\npreviously recorded. And the origin of it was the fact that I was now\nengaged to Avis Beechinor though it was not as yet to be \"announced\";\njust this concession alone had Mrs. Beechinor wrested from an indignant\nand, latterly, a tearful interview.... For I had called at Selwoode, in\ndue form; and after leaving Mrs. Beechinor had been pounced upon by an\nexcited and comely little person in black.\n\n\"Don't you mind a word she said,\" this lady had exhorted, \"because she\nis _the_ Gadarene swine, and Avis has told me everything! Of course you\nare to be married at once, and I only wish _I_ could find the only man\nin the world who can keep me interested for four hours on a stretch and\nsend my pulse up to a hundred and make me feel those thrilly thrills\nI've always longed for.\"\n\n\"But surely--\" said I.\n\n\"No, I'm beginning to be afraid not, beautiful, though of course I used\nto be crazy about Billy Woods; and then once I was engaged to another\nman for a long time, and I was perfectly devoted to him, but he _never_\nmade me feel a single thrilly thrill. And would you believe it, Mr.\nTownsend?--after a while he came back, precisely as though he had been a\nbad penny or a cat. He had been in the Boer War and came home just a\nnight before I left, wounded and promoted several times and completely\ncovered with glory and brass buttons. He came seven miles to see me, and\nI thoroughly enjoyed seeing him, for I had on my best dress and was\nfeeling rather talkative. Well! at ten I was quite struck on him. At\neleven perfectly willing to part friends, and at twelve _crazy_ for him\nto go. He stayed till half-past, and I didn't want to think of him for\ndays. And, by the way, I am Miss Hugonin, and I hope you and Avis will\nbe very happy. _Good-bye!_\"\n\n\"Good-bye!\" said I.\n\n\n 2\n\nAnd that, oddly enough, was the one private talk I ever had with the\nMargaret Hugonin whom, for some two weeks, I had believed myself to be\nupon the verge of marrying; for the next time I conversed with her alone\nshe was Mrs. William Woods.\n\n\"Oh, go away, Billy!\" she then said, impatiently \"How often will I have\nto tell you it isn't decent to be always hanging around your wife? Oh,\nyou dear little crooked-necktied darling!\"--and she remedied the fault\non tiptoe,--\"_please_ run away and make love to somebody else, and be\nsure to get her name right, so that I shan't assassinate the wrong\nperson,--because I want to tell this very attractive child all about\nAvis, and not be bothered.\" And subsequently she did.\n\nBut I must not forestall her confidences, lest I get my cart even\nfurther in advance of my nominal Pegasus than the loosely-made\nconveyance is at present lumbering.\n\n\n 3\n\nAnd meanwhile Peter Blagden and I had called at Selwoode once or twice\nin unison and due estate. And Peter considered \"Miss Beechinor a damn\nfine girl, and Miss Hugonin too, only--\"\n\n\"Only,\" I prompted, between puffs, \"Miss Hugonin keeps everybody, as my\nold Mammy used to say, 'in a perpetual swivet.' I never understood what\nthe phrase meant, precisely, but I somehow always knew that it was\neloquent.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Peter. \"You prefer--ah--a certain amount of\ntranquillity. I haven't been abroad for a long while,\" said Mr. Blagden;\nand then, after another meditative pause: \"Now Stella--well, Stella was\na damn sight too good for me, of course--\"\n\n\"She was,\" I affably assented.\n\n\"--and I'd be the very last man in the world to deny it. But still you\n_do_ prefer--\" Then Peter broke off short and said: \"My God, Bob! what's\nthe matter?\"\n\nSo I think I must have had the ill-taste to have laughed a little over\nMr. Blagden's magnanimity in regard to Stella's foibles. But I only\nsaid: \"Oh, nothing, Peter! I was just going to tell you that travelling\n_does_ broaden the mind, and that you will find an overcoat\nindispensable in Switzerland, and that during the voyage you ought to\nkeep in the open air as much as possible, and that you should give the\nsteward who waits on you at table at least ten shillings,--I was just\ngoing to tell you, in fine, that you would be a fool to squander any\nmoney on a guide-book, when I am here to give you all the necessary\npointers.\"\n\n\"But I didn't mean to go to Europe exactly,\" said Mr. Blagden; \"--I just\nmeant to go abroad in a general sense. Any place would be abroad, you\nknow, where people weren't always remembering how rich you were, and\nweren't scrambling to marry you out of hand, but really cared, you know,\nlike she does. Oh, may be it _is_ bad form to mention it, but I couldn't\nhelp seeing how she looked at you, Bob. And it waked something--Oh, I\ndon't know what I mean,\" said Peter--\"it's just damn foolishness,\nI suppose.\"\n\n\"It's very far from that,\" I said; and I was honestly moved, just as I\nalways am when pathos, preferably grotesque, has caught me unprepared.\nThis millionaire was lonely, because of his millions, and Stella was\ndead; and somehow I understood, and laid one hand upon his shoulder.\n\n\"Oh, _you_ can't help it, I suppose, if all women love by ordinary\nbecause he is so like another person, where as men love because she is\nso different. My poor caliph, I would sincerely advise you to play the\nfool just as you plan to do,--oh, anywhere,--and without even a Mesrour.\nIn fine go Bunburying at once. For very frankly, First Cousin of the\nMoon, it is the one thing worth while in life.\"\n\n\"I half believe I will,\" said Peter.... So he was packing in the interim\nduring which I pretended to be writing, and was in reality fretting to\nthink that, whilst Avis was in England by this, I could not decently\nleave America until those last five chapters were finished. So, in part\nas an excuse for not scrawling the dullest of nonsense and subsequently\ntearing it up, I fell to considering the unquestionable fact that I was\nin love with Avis, and upon the verge of marrying her, and was in\nconsequence, as a matter of plain logic, deliriously happy.\n\n\"For when you are in love with a woman you, of course, want to marry her\nmore than you want anything else. In nature, it is a serious and--well,\nan almost irretrievable business. And I shall have to cultivate the\ndomestic virtues and smoke cheaper cigarettes and all that, but I shall\nbe glad to do every one of these things, for her sake--after a while. I\nshall probably enjoy doing them.\"\n\nAnd I read Bettie Hamlyn's letter for the seventeenth time....\n\n\n 4\n\nFor Bettie had answered the wild rhapsody which I wrote to tell her how\nmuch in love I was with Elena Barry-Smith. And in the nature of things I\nhad not written Bettie again to tell her I was, and by a deal the more,\nin love with Avis Beechinor. The task was delicate, the reasons for my\nnot unnatural change were such as you must transmit in a personal\ninterview during which you are particularly boyish and talk very fast.\n\nBesides, I do not like writing letters; and moreover, there was no real\nneed to write. I was going to Gridlington; what more natural than to\nride over to Fairhaven some clear morning and tell Bettie everything? I\npictured her surprise and her delight at seeing me, and reflected it\nwould be unfair to her to render an inaccurate account of matters, such\nas any letter must necessarily give.\n\nOnly, first, there was the garden of Peter's aunt,--which sounds like\nan introductory French exercise,--and then Avis came. And, somehow, I\nhad not, in consequence, traversed the scant nine miles that lay as yet\nbetween me and Bettie Hamlyn. I kept on meaning to do it the next day.\n\nAnd the next day after this I really did.\n\n\"For I ought to tell Bettie about everything,\" I reflected. \"No matter\nif the engagement is a secret, I ought to tell Bettie about it.\"\n\n\n 5\n\nWhen I had done so, Bettie shook her head. \"Oh, Robin, Robin!\" she said,\n\"how did I ever come to raise a child that doesn't know his own mind for\nas much as two minutes? And how dared that Barry-Smith person to slap\nyou, I would like to know.\"\n\n\"Now you're jealous, Bettie. You are thinking she infringed upon an\nentirely personal privilege, and you resent it.\"\n\n\"Well,--but I've the right to, you see, and she hadn't. I consider her\nto be a bold-faced jig. And I don't approve of this Avis person either,\nyou understand; but we poor mothers are always being annoyed by slushy,\nmushy Avises. I suppose there's a reason for it. She'll throw you over,\nyou know, as soon as _her_ mother has had an inning or two. That's why\nshe took her to Europe,\" Bettie explained, with a fine confusion of\npersonalities. \"Only she just wanted any quiet place where she could\ntake aromatic spirits of ammonia and point out between doses that she\nhas given up her entire life to her child and has never made any demands\non her and hasn't the strength to argue with her, because her heart is\nsimply broken. We mothers always say that; and the funny part is that if\nyou say it often enough it invariably works far better than any possible\nargument.\"\n\nI told her she was talking nonsense, and she said, irrelevantly enough:\n\"Setebos, and Setebos, and Setebos! I don't think very highly of Setebos\nsometimes, because He muddles things so. Oh, well, I shan't cry Willow.\nBesides there _aren't_ any sycamore-trees in the garden. So let's go\ninto the garden, dear. That sounds as if I ate in the back pantry,\ndoesn't it? Of course you aren't of any account any more, and you never\nwill be, but at least you don't look at people as though they were a new\nsort of bug whenever they have just thought a sentence or two and then\ngone on, without bothering to say it.\"\n\nSo we went into Bettie's garden. It had not changed....\n\n\n 6\n\nNothing had changed. It was as though I had somehow managed, after all,\nto push back the hands of the clock. Fairhaven accepted me incuriously.\nI was only \"an old student.\" In addition, I was vaguely rumoured to\nwrite \"pieces\" for the magazines. Probably I did; \"old students\" were\noften prone to vagaries after leaving King's College; for instance, they\ntold me, Ralph Means was a professional gambler, and Ox Selwyn had\nlately gone to Shanghai and had settled there,--and Shanghai, in common\nwith most other places, Fairhaven accorded the negative tribute of just\nnot absolutely disbelieving in its existence.\n\nNothing had changed. The Finals were over; and with the noisy exodus of\nthe college-boys, Fairhaven had sunk contentedly into an even deeper\nstupor, as Fairhaven always does in summer. And, for the rest, the\nunpaved sidewalks were just as dusty, the same deep ruts and the puddles\nwhich never dry, not even in mid-August, adorned Fairhaven's single\nstreet; the comfortable moss upon Fairhaven's roofs had not varied by a\nshade; and George Washington or Benjamin Franklin might have stepped out\nof any one of those brass-knockered doorways without incongruity and\nwithout finding any noticeable innovation to marvel at.\n\nNothing had changed. In the precise middle of the campus Lord Penniston,\nour Governor in Colonial days, still posed, in dingy marble; and the\nfracture of the finger I had inadvertently broken off, the night that\nBilly Woods and I painted the statue all over, in six colours, was white\nand new-looking. Kathleen Eppes had married her Spaniard and had left\nFairhaven; otherwise the same girls were already planning their toilets\nfor the Y.M.C.A. reception in October, which formally presents the \"new\nstudents\" to society at large; and presently these girls would be going\nto the germans or the Opera House with the younger brother of the boy\nwho used to take them thither....\n\nNothing had changed; not even I was changed. For I had soon discovered\nthat Bettie Hamlyn did not care a pin for me in myself. She was simply\nvery fond of me because, at times, I reminded her of a boy who had gone\nto King's College; and her reception of me, for the first two days, was\nunmistakably provisional.\n\n\"Very well!\" I said.\n\nAnd I did it. For I knew how difficult it was to deceive Bettie, and in\nconsequence all my faculties rose to the challenge. I did not merely\nmimic my former self, I was compelled, almost, to believe I was indeed\nthat former self, because not otherwise could I get Bettie Hamlyn's\ntoleration. Had I paused even momentarily to reflect upon the excellence\nof my acting, she would have known. So I resolutely believed I was being\nperfectly candid; and with constant use those older tricks of speech and\ngesture and almost of thought, at first laborious mimicry, became\nwell-nigh involuntary.\n\nIn fine, we could not wipe away five years, but with practice we found\nthat you would very often forget them, and for quite a while....\n\nI had explained to Bettie's father I was going to board with them that\nsummer. Had I not been so haphazard in the progress of this narrative, I\nwould have earlier announced that Bettie's father was the Latin\nprofessor at King's College. He was very old and vague, and his general\nattitude toward the universe was that of remote recollection of having\nnoticed something of the sort before. Professor Hamlyn, therefore, told\nme he was glad to hear of my intended stay beneath his roof; hazarded\nthe speculation that I had written a book which he meant to read upon\nthe very first opportunity; blinked once or twice; and forthwith lapsed\ninto consideration of some Pliocene occurrence which, if you were to\njudge by the expression of his mild old countenance, he did not find\nentirely satisfactory....\n\nSo I spent three months in Fairhaven; and Bettie and I read all the old\nbooks over again, and were perfectly happy.\n\n\n 7\n\nAnd what I wrote in those last five chapters of my book was so good that\nin common decency I was compelled to alter the preceding twenty-nine and\nbring them a bit nearer to Bettie's standard. For I was utilising\nBettie's ideas. She did not have the knack of putting them on paper;\nthat was my trivial part, as I now recognised with a sort of scared\nreverence.\n\n\"Of course, though, you had to meddle,\" I would scold at her. \"I had\nmeant the infernal thing to be a salable book. To-day it is just a\nstenographic report of how these people elected to behave. I haven't\nanything to do with it. I wash my hands of it. I consider you, in fine,\na cormorant, a conscienceless marauder, a meddlesome Mattie, _and_ a\nborn dramatist.\"\n\n\"But, it's _much_ better than anything you've ever done, Robin--\"\n\n\"That is what I'm grumbling about. I consider it very unfeeling of you\nto write better novels than I do,\" I retorted. \"But, oh, how good that\nscene is!\" I said, a little later.\n\n\"Let's see--'For you, dear clean-souled girl, were born to be the wife\nof a strong man, and the mother of his dirty children'--no, it's\n'sturdy', but then you hardly ever cross your T's. And where he goes on\nto tell her he can't marry her, because he is artistic, and she is too\npractical for them to be real mates, and all that other\nfeeble-mindedness? Dear me, did I forget to tell you we were going to\ncut that out?\"\n\n\"But I particularly like that part--\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said Bettie, as her pen scrunched vicious lines through it.\nThen she said: \"I only hope she had the civility and self-control not to\nlaugh until you had gone away. And 'We irrelevant folk that design all\nuseless and beautiful things,' indeed! No, I couldn't have blamed her if\nshe laughed right out. I wonder if you will never understand that what\nyou take to be your love for beautiful things is really just a dislike\nof ugly ones? Oh, I've no patience with you! And wanting to print it in\na book, too, instead of being content to make yourself ridiculous in\ntete-a-tetes with minxes that don't especially matter!\"\n\n\"Well--! Anyhow, I agree with you that, thanks to your editing and\ncarping and general scurrility, this book is going to be,\" I meekly\nstated, \"a little better than _The Apostates_ and not just 'pretty much\nlike any other book'.\"\n\n\"Do you know that's just what I was thinking,\" said Bettie, dolefully.\nShe clasped both hands behind her crinkly small black head, and in that\nqueer habitual pose appraised me, from between her elbows, in that way\nwhich always made me feel I had better be careful. \"Damn you!\" was\nher verdict.\n\n\"Whence this unmaidenliness?\" I queried, with due horror.\n\n\"You are trying to prove to me that it has been worth while. This nasty\nbook is coming alive, here in our own eight-cornered room, with a horrid\ncrawly life of its own that it would never have had if you hadn't been\nlearning things my boy knew nothing about. That's what you are crowing\nin my face, when you keep quiet and smirk. Oh, but I know you!\"\n\n\"You do think, then, that, between you and me, it is really coming\nalive?\"\n\n\"Yes,--if that greatly matters to the fat literary gent that I don't\ncare for greatly. Yes, the infernal thing will be a Book, with quite a\nsizable B. I am feeding its maw with more important things than a few\nideas, though. The thing is a monster that isn't worth its keep. For my\nboy was worth more than a Book,\" she said, forlornly,--\"oh,\noceans more!\"\n\n\n 8\n\nAll in all, we were a deal more than happy during these three very hot\nmonths. It was a sort of Lotus Eaters' existence, shared by just us two,\nwith Josiah Clarriker intruding occasionally, and with echoes from the\nouter world, when heard at all, resounding very dimly and unimportantly.\nI began almost to assume, as Fairhaven tacitly assumed, that there was\nreally no outer world, or none at least to be considered seriously....\n\nFor instance: Marian Winwood had come to Lichfield, and wrote me from\nthere, \"hoping that we would renew an acquaintance which she remembered\nso pleasurably.\" It did not seem worth while, of course, to answer the\nminx; I decided, at a pinch, to say that the Fairhaven mail-service was\nabominable, and that her letter had never reached me. But the young\nfellow who two years ago had wandered about the Green Chalybeate with\nher had become, now, as unreal as she. I glimpsed the couple, with\nimmeasurable aloofness, as phantoms flickering about the mirage of a\nbrook, throwing ghostly bread crumbs to Lethean minnows.\n\nAnd then, too, when the police caught Ned Lethbury that summer, it\nhardly seemed worth while to wonder about his wife. For she was,\ninexplicably, with him, all through the trial at Chiswick, you may\nremember, though you were probably more interested at the time by the\nHumbert trial in Paris. In any event, no rumor came to me in Fairhaven\nto connect Amelia Lethbury with Nadine Neroni, but, instead, a deal of\njournalistic pity and sympathy for her, the faithful, much-enduring\nwife. Still quite a handsome woman, they said, for all her suffering and\npoverty.... And when he went to the penitentiary, Amelia Lethbury\ndisappeared, nobody knew whither, except that I suspected Anton von\nAnspach knew. I could not explain the mystery. I did not greatly care\nto, for to me it did not seem important, now....\n\n\n 9\n\nMeantime, I meditated.\n\n\"I am in love with Avis--oh, granted! I am not the least bit in love\nwith--we will euphemistically say 'anyone else.' But confound it! I am\ncoming to the conclusion that marrying a woman because you happen to be\nin love with her is about as logical a proceeding as throwing the cat\nout of the window because the rhododendrons are in bloom. Why, if I\nmarry Avis I shall probably have to live with her the rest of my life!\n\n\"What if that obsolete notion of Schopenhauer's were true after\nall,--that love is a blind instinct which looks no whit toward the\nwelfare of the man and woman it dominates, but only to the equipment a\nchild born of them would inherit? What if, after all, love tends,\nwithout variation, to yoke the most incompatible in order that the\naverage type of humanity may be preserved? Then the one passion we\nesteem as sacred would be simply the deranged condition of any other\nbeast in rutting-time. Then we, with the pigs and sparrows, would be\njust so many pieces on the chess-board, and our evolutions would be just\na friendly trial of skill between what we call life and death.\n\n\"I love Avis Beechinor. But I have loved, in all sincerity, many other\nwomen, and I rejoice to-day, unfeignedly, that I never married any of\nthem. For marriage means a life-long companionship, a long, long journey\nwherein must be adjusted, one by one, each tiniest discrepancy between\nthe fellow-wayfarers; and always a pebble if near enough to the eye will\nobscure a mountain.\n\n\"Why, Avis cannot attempt a word of four syllables without coming at\nleast once to grief! It is a trifle of course, but in a life-long\ncompanionship there are exactly fourteen thousand trifles to one event\nof importance. And deuce take it! the world is populated by men and\nwomen, not demi-gods; the poets are specious and abandoned rhetoricians;\nfor it never was, and never will be, possible to love anybody 'to the\nlevel of every-day's Most quiet need by sun or candlelight.'\n\n\"Or not to me at least.\n\n\"In a sentence, when it comes to a life-long companionship, I prefer not\nthe woman who would make me absolutely happy for a twelvemonth, but\nrather the woman with whom I could chat contentedly for twenty years,\nand who would keep me to the mark. I am rather tired of being futile;\nand not for any moral reason, but because it is not worthy of _me_. In\nfine, I do not want to die entirely. I want to leave behind some not\ninadequate expression of Robert Etheridge Townsend, and I do not care at\nall what people say of it, so that it is here when I am gone. Oh, Stella\nunderstood! 'I want my life to count, I want to leave something in the\nworld that wasn't there before I came.'\n\n\"Now Bettie--\"\n\nI arose resolutely. \"I had much better go for a long, and tedious, and\njolting, and universally damnable walk. Bettie would make something\nvital of me--if I could afford her the material--\"\n\nAnd I grinned a little. \"'Go, therefore, now, and work; for there shall\nno straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.' Yes,\nyou would certainly have need of a miracle, dear Bettie--\"\n\n\n 10\n\nI started for that walk I was to take. But Dr. Jeal and Colonel Snawley\nwere seated in armchairs in front of Clarriker's Emporium, just as they\nhad been used to sit there in my college days, enjoying, as the Colonel\nmentioned, \"the cool of the evening,\" although to the casual observer\nthe real provider of their pleasure would have appeared to be an\nunlimited supply of chewing-tobacco.\n\nSo I lingered here, and garnered, to an accompaniment of leisurely\nexpectorations, much knowledge as to the fall crops and the carryings-on\nof the wife of a celebrated general, upon whose staff the Colonel had\nserved during the War,--and there has never been in the world's history\nbut one war, so far as Fairhaven is concerned,--and how the Colonel\nwalked right in on them, and how it was hushed up.\n\nThen we discussed the illness of Pope Leo and what everybody knew about\nthose derned cardinals, and the riots in Evansville, and the Panama\nCanal business, and the squally look of things at Port Arthur, and\nattributed all these imbroglios, I think, to the Republican\nadministration. Even at our bitterest, though, we conceded that\n\"Teddy's\" mother was a Bulloch, and that his uncle fired the last shot\nbefore the Alabama went down. And that inclined us to forgive him\neverything, except of course, the Booker Washington luncheon.\n\nThen half a block farther on, Mrs. Rabbet wanted to know if I had ever\nseen such weather, and to tell me exactly what Adrian, Junior--no longer\nlittle Adey, no indeed, sir, but ready to start right in at the College\nsession after next, and as she often said to Mr. Rabbet you could hardly\nbelieve it,--had observed the other day, and quick as a flash too,\nbecause it would make such a funny story. Only she could never quite\ndecide whether it happened on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, so that, after\nprecisely seven digressions on this delicate point, the denouement of\nthe tale, I must confess, fell rather flat.\n\nAnd then Mab Spessifer demanded that I come up on the porch and draw\nsome pictures for her. The child was waiting with three sheets of paper\nand a chewed pencil all ready, just on the chance that I might pass; and\nyou cannot very well refuse a cripple who adores you and is not able to\nplay with the other brats. You get instead into a kind of habit of\ncalling every day and trying to make her laugh, because she is such a\nhelpless little nuisance.\n\nAnd tousled mothers weep over you in passageways and tell you how good\nyou are, and altogether the entire affair is tedious; but having started\nit, you keep it up, somehow.\n\n\n 11\n\nIn fine, it is a symbol that I never took the walk which was to dust the\ncobwebs from my brain and make me just like all the other persons, thick\nabout me, who grow up, and mate, and beget, and die, in the incurious\nfashion of oxen, without ever wondering if there is any plausible reason\nfor doing it; and my brief progress was upon the surface very like that\nof the bedeviled fellow in _Les Facheux_. Yet I enjoyed it somehow.\nNever to be hurried, and always to stop and talk with every person whom\nyou meet, upon topics in which no conceivable human being could possibly\nbe interested, may not sound attractive, but in Fairhaven it is the\nrule; and, oddly enough, it breeds, in practice, a sort of family\nfeeling,--if only by entitling everybody to the condoned and\nmatter-of-course stupidity of aunts and uncles,--which is not really all\nunpleasant.\n\nSo I went home at half-past seven, to supper and to Bettie, in a quite\ncontented frame of mind. It did not seem conceivable that any world so\nbeautiful and stupid and well-meaning could have either the heart or the\nwit to thwart my getting anything I really wanted; and the thought\nelated me.\n\nOnly I did not know, precisely, what I wanted.\n\n\n\n\n28.\n\n_He Participates in Sundry Confidences_\n\n\nI was in the act of writing to Avis when the letter came; and I put it\naside unopened, until after supper, for I had never found the letters of\nAvis particularly interesting reading.\n\n\"It will be what they call a newsy letter, of course. I do wish that\nAvis would not write to me as if she were under oath to tell the entire\ntruth. She communicates so many things which actually happened that it\nreads like a 'special correspondent' in some country town writing for a\nSunday morning's paper,--and with, to a moral certainty, the word\n'separate' lurking somewhere spelt with three E's, and an 'always' with\ntwo L's, and at least one 'alright.' No, my dear, I am at present too\nbusy expressing my adoration for you to be exposed to such\ninharmonious jars.\"\n\nThen I wrote my dithyrambs and sealed them. Subsequently I poised the\nunopened letter between my fingers.\n\n\"But remember that if she were here to _say_ all this to you, your\npulses would be pounding like the pistons of an excited locomotive!\nNature, you are a jade! I console myself with the reflection that it is\nfrequently the gift of facile writing which makes the co-respondent,\n--but I _do_ wish you were not such a hazardous matchmaker. Oh, well!\nthere was no pleasant way of getting out of it, and that particular\nRubicon is miles behind.\"\n\nI slit the envelope.\n\nI read the letter through again, with redoubling interest, and presently\nbegan to laugh. \"So she begins to fear we have been somewhat hasty, asks\na little time for reconsideration of her precise sentiment toward me,\nand feels meanwhile in honour bound to release me from our engagement!\nYet if upon mature deliberation--eh, oh, yes! twaddle! _and_\ncommonplace! and dashed, of course, with a jigger of Scriptural\nquotation!\"\n\nI paused to whistle. \"There is strange milk in this cocoanut, could I\nbut discern its nature.\"\n\nI did, some four weeks later, when with a deal of mail I received the\nlast letter I was ever to receive from Avis Beechinor.\n\nWrote Avis:\n\nDEAR ROBERT:\n\nThank you very much for returning my letters and for the beautiful\nletter you wrote me. No I believe it better you should not come on to\nsee me now and talk the matter over as you suggest because it would\nprobably only make you unhappy. And then too I am sure some day you will\nbe friends with me and a very good and true one. I return the last\nletter you sent me in a seperate envelope, and I hope it will reach you\nalright, but as I destroy all my mail as soon as I have read it I cannot\nsend you the others. I have promised to marry Mr. Blagden and we are\ngoing to be married on the fifteenth of this month very quietly with no\noutsiders. So good bye Robert. I wish you every success and happiness\nthat you may desire and with all my heart I pray you to be true to your\nbetter self. God bless you allways. Your sincere friend,\n\nAVIS M. BEECHINOR\n\nI indulged in a low and melodious whistle. \"The little slut!\"\n\nThen I said: \"Peter Blagden again! I _do_ wish that life would try to be\na trifle more plausible. Why, but, of course! Peter meant to go chasing\nafter her the minute my back was turned, and that was why he salved his\nconscience by presenting me with that thousand 'to get married on,' Even\nat the time it seemed peculiarly un-Petrine. Well, anyhow, in simple\ndecency, he cannot combine the part of Shylock with that of Judas, and\nexpect to have back his sordid lucre, so I am that much to the good,\napart from everything else. Yes, I can see how it all happened,--and I\ncan foresee what is going to happen, too, thank heaven!\"\n\nFor, as drowning men are said to recollect the unrecallable, I had\nvividly seen in that instant the two months' action just overpast, and\nits three participants,--the thin-lipped mother, the besotted\nmillionaire, and the girl shakily hesitant between ideals and the habits\nof a life-time.\n\n\"But I might have known the mother would win,\" I reflected: \"Why, didn't\nBettie say she would?\"\n\nI refolded the letter I had just read, to keep it as a salutary relic;\nand then:\n\n\"Dear Avis!\" said I; \"now heaven bless your common-sense! and I don't\nespecially mind if heaven blesses your horrific painted hag of a mother,\nalso, if they've a divine favor or two to spare.\"\n\nAnd I saw there was a letter from Peter Blagden, too. It said, in part:\n\nI am everything that you think me, Bob. My one defence is that I could\nnot help it. I loved her from the moment I saw her ... You did not\nappreciate her, you know. You take, if you will forgive my saying it,\ntoo light a view of life to value the love of a good woman properly, and\nAvis noticed it of course. Now I do understand what the unselfish love\nof woman means, because my first wife was an angel, as you know ... It\nis a comfort to think that my dear saint in heaven knows I am not quite\nso lonely now, and is gladdened by that knowledge. I know she would have\nwished it--\n\nI read no further. \"Oh, Stella! they have all forgotten. They all insist\nto-day that you were an angel, and they have come almost to believe that\nyou habitually flew about the world in a night-gown, with an Easter lily\nin your hand--But I remember, dear. I know you'd scratch her eyes out. I\nknow you'd do it now, if only you were able, because you loved this\nPeter Blagden.\"\n\nThereafter I must have wasted a full quarter of an hour in recalling all\nsorts of bygone unimportant happenings, and I was not bothering one way\nor the other about Avis ...\n\n\n 3\n\nIn the moonlighted garden I found Bettie. But with her was Josiah\nClarriker, Fairhaven's leading business-man. He shook hands, and\nwhatever delight he may have felt at seeing me was admirably controlled.\n\n\"Now don't let me interfere with your eloquence,\" I urged, \"but go right\non with the declamation.\"\n\n\"I make no pretension to eloquence, Mr. Townsend. I was merely recalling\nto Miss Hamlyn's attention the beautiful lines of our immortal poet,\nOwen Meredith, which run, as I remember them:\n\n  \"'I thought of the dress she wore that time\n    That we stood under the cypress-tree together,\n  In that land, in that clime,\n    And I turned and looked, and she was sitting there\n  In the box next to the stage, and dressed\n    In that muslin dress, with that full soft hair\n  And that jessamine blossom at her breast.'\"\n\n\"But I am not permitted to wear flowers when Mr. Townsend is about,\"\nsaid Bettie. \"Did you know, Jo, that he is crazy about that too?\"\n\n\"Well--! Anyhow, Meredith is full of very beautiful sentiments,\" said\nMr. Clarriker, \"and I have always been particularly fond of that piece.\nIt is called _'Ox Italians.'_\"\n\n\"Yes, I have been previously affected by it,\" said I, \"and very deeply\nmoved.\"\n\n\"And so--as I was about to observe, Miss Hamlyn,--you will notice that\nthe poet Meredith gowned one of the most beautiful characters he ever\ncreated in white, and laid great stress upon the fact that her beauty\nwas immeasurably enhanced by the dainty simplicity of her muslin dress.\nThis fabric, indeed, suits all types of faces and figures, and is\nEconomical too, especially the present popular mercerised waistings and\nvestings that are fast invading the realm of silks. We show at our\nEmporium an immense quantity of these beautiful goods, in more than a\nhundred styles, elaborate enough for the most formal occasions, at fifty\nand seventy-five cents a yard; and--as I was about to observe, Miss\nHamlyn,--I would indeed esteem it a favour should you permit me to send\nup a few samples to-morrow, from which to make a selection at, I need\nnot add, my personal expense.\n\n\"You see, Mr. Townsend,\" he continued, more inclusively, \"we have no\nflorists in Fairhaven, and I have heard that candy--\" He talked on,\nhygienically now....\n\n\n 4\n\n\"And that,\" said I, when Mr. Clarriker had gone, \"is what you are\nactually considering! I have always believed Dickens invented that man\nto go into one of the latter chapters of _Edwin Drood_. It is the\nsolitary way of explaining certain people,--that they were invented by\nsome fagged novelist who unfortunately died before he finished the book\nthey were to be locked up in. As it was, they got loose, to annoy you by\ntheir incredibility. No actual human being, you know, would suggest a\nwhite shirtwaist as a substitute for a box of candy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have seen worse,\" said Bettie, as in meditation. \"It's just Jo's\nway of expressing the fact that I am stupendously beautiful in white.\nPoor dear, my loveliness went to his head, I suppose, and got tangled\nwith next week's advertisement for the _Gazette_. Anyhow, he is a deal\nmore considerate than you. For instance, I was crazy to go to the show\non Tuesday night, and Josiah Clarriker was the only person who thought\nto ask me, even though he is one of those little fireside companions who\nalways get so syrupy whenever they take you anywhere that you simply\ncan't stand it. The combination both prevented my acceptance and\naccentuated his devotion; and quite frankly, Robin, I am thinking of\nhim, for at bottom Jo is a dear.\"\n\nI laid one hand on each of Bettie's shoulders; and it was in my mind at\nthe time that this was the gesture of a comrade, and had not any sexual\ntinge at all. I wished that Bettie had better teeth, of course, but that\ncould not be helped.\n\n\"You are to marry me as soon as may be possible,\" said I, \"and\npreferably to-morrow afternoon. Avis has thrown me over, God bless her,\nand I am free,--until of course you take charge of me. There was a\nclever woman once who told me I was not fit to be the captain of my\nsoul, though I would make an admirable lieutenant. She was right. It is\nunderstood you are to henpeck me to your heart's content and to my\nultimate salvation.\"\n\n\"I shall assuredly not marry you,\" observed Miss Hamlyn, \"until you have\nat least asked me to do so. And besides, how dared she throw\nyou over--!\"\n\n\"But I don't intend to ask you, for I have not a single bribe to offer.\nI merely intend to marry you. I am a ne'er-do-well, a debauchee, a\ntippler, a compendium of all the vices you care to mention. I am not a\nbit in love with you, and as any woman will forewarn you, I am sure to\nmake you a vile husband. Your solitary chance is to bully me into\ntemperance and propriety and common-sense, with precisely seven million\nprobabilities against you, because I am a seasoned and accomplished\nliar. Can you do that bullying, Bettie,--and keep it up, I mean?\"\n\nAnd she was silent for a while. \"Robin,\" she said, at last, \"you'll\nnever understand why women like you. You will always think it is because\nthey admire you for some quality or another. It is really because they\npity you. You are such a baby, riding for a fall--No, I don't mean the\nboyishness you trade upon. I have known for a long while all that was\njust put on. And, oh, how hard you've tried to be a boy of late!\"\n\n\"And I thought I had fooled you, Bettie! Well, I never could. I am\nsorry, though, if I have been annoyingly clumsy--\"\n\n\"But you were doing it for me,\" she said. \"You were doing it because you\nthought I'd like it. Oh, can't you understand that I _know_ you are\nworthless, and that you have never loved any human being in all your\nlife except that flibbertigibbet Stella Blagden, and that I know, too,\nyou have so rarely failed me! If you were an admirable person, or a\nperson with commendable instincts, or an unselfish person, or if you\nwere even in love with me, it wouldn't count of course. It is because\nyou are none of these things that it counts for so much to see you\nhonest with me--sometimes,--and even to see you scheming and\nplay-acting--and so transparently!--just to bring about a little\npleasure for me. Oh, Robin, I am afraid that nowadays I love you\n_because_ of your vices!\"\n\n\"And I you because of your virtues,\" said I; \"so that there is no\npossible apprehension of either affection ever going into bankruptcy.\nTherefore the affair is settled; and we will be married in November.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Bettie said, \"I suppose that somebody has to break you of this\nhabit of getting married next November--\"\n\nThen, and only then, my hands were lifted from her shoulders. And we\nbegan to talk composedly of more impersonal matters.\n\n\n 5\n\nIt was two days later that John Charteris came to Fairhaven; and I met\nhim the same afternoon upon Cambridge street. The little man stopped\nshort and in full view of the public achieved what, had he been a child,\nwere most properly describable as making a face at me.\n\n\"That,\" he explained, \"expresses the involuntary confusion of Belial on\nre-encountering the anchorite who escaped his diabolical machinations.\nBut, oh, dear me! haven't you been translated yet? Why, I thought the\ncarriage would have called long ago, just as it did for Elijah.\"\n\n\"Now, don't be an ass, John. I _was_ rather idiotic, I suppose--\"\n\n\"Of course you were,\" he said, as we shook hands. \"It is your unfailing\ncharm. You silly boy, I came from the pleasantest sort of house-party at\nMatocton because I heard you were here, and I have been foolish enough\nto miss you. Anne and the others don't arrive until October. Oh, you\nadorable child, I have read the last book, and every one of the short\nstories as well, and I want to tell you that in their own peculiar line\nthe two volumes are masterpieces. Anne wept and chuckled over them, and\nso did I, with an equal lack of restraint; only it was over the noble\nand self-sacrificing portions that Anne wept, and she laughed at the\nplaces where you were droll intentionally. Whereas I--!! Well, we will\nlet the aposiopesis stand.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I sulkily observed, \"if you have simply come to Fairhaven\nto make fun of me, I can only pity your limitations.\"\n\nHe spoke in quite another voice. \"You silly boy, it was not at all for\nthat. I think you must know I have read what you have published thus far\nwith something more than interest; but I wanted to tell you this in so\nmany words. _Afield_ is not perhaps an impeccable masterwork, if one may\nbe thus brutally frank; but the woman--modeled after discretion will not\ninquire whom,--is distinctly good. And what, with you only twenty-five,\ndoes _A field_ not promise! Child, you have found your metier. Now I\nshall look forward to the accomplishment of what I have always felt sure\nthat you could do. I am very, very glad. More so than I can say. And I\nhad thought you must know this without my saying it.\"\n\nThe man was sincere. And I was very much pleased, and remembered what\ninvaluable help he could give me on my unfinished book, and what fun it\nwould be to go over the manuscript with him. And, in fine, we became\nagain, upon the spot as it were, the very best of friends.\n\n\n 6\n\nIt was excellent to have Charteris to talk against. The little man had\nmany tales to tell me of those dissolute gay people we had known and\nfrolicked with; indeed, I think that he was trying to allure me back to\nthe old circles, for he preoccupied his life by scheming to bring about\nby underhand methods some perfectly unimportant consummation, which very\noften a plain word would have secured at once. But now he swore he was\nnot \"making tea.\"\n\nThat had always been a byword between us, by the way, since I applied to\nhim the phrase first used of Alexander Pope--\"that he could not make tea\nwithout a conspiracy.\" And it may be that in this case Charteris spoke\nthe truth, and had come to Fairhaven just for the pleasure of seeing me,\nfor certainly he must have had some reason for leaving the Musgraves'\nhouse-party so abruptly.\n\n\"You are very well rid of the Hardresses,\" he adjudged. \"Did I tell you\nof the male one's exhibition of jealousy last year! I can assure you\nthat the fellow now entertains for me precisely the same affection I\nhave always borne toward cold lamb. It is the real tragedy of my life\nthat Anne is ethically incapable of letting a week pass without\npartaking of a leg of mutton. She is not particularly fond of it, and\nindeed I never encountered anybody who was; she has simply been reared\nwith the notion that 'people' always have mutton once a week. What, have\nyou never noticed that with 'people,' to eat mutton once a week is a\nsort of guarantee of respectability? I do not refer to chops of course,\nwhich are not wholly inconsistent with depravity. But the ability to eat\nmutton in its roasted form, by some odd law of nature, connotes the\nhabit of paying your pew-rent regularly and of changing your flannels on\nthe proper date. However, I was telling you about Jasper Hardress--\" And\nCharteris repeated the story of their imbroglio in such a fashion that\nit sounded farcical.\n\n\"But, after all, John, you _did_ make love to her.\"\n\n\"I have forgotten what was exactly the last observation of the lamented\nJulius Caesar,\" Mr. Charteris leisurely observed,--\"though I remember\nthat at the time it impressed me as being uncommonly appropriate--But to\nget back: do you not see that this clause ought to come here, at the end\nof the sentence? And, child, on all my ancient bended knees, I implore\nyou to remember that 'genuine' does not mean the same thing as\n'real'....\"\n\n\n 7\n\nMeanwhile he and Bettie got on together a deal better than I had ever\nanticipated.\n\nCharteris, though, received my confidence far too lightly. \"You are\ngoing to marry her! Why, naturally! Ever since I encountered you, you\nhave been 'going to marry' somebody or other. It is odd I should have\nwritten about the Foolish Prince so long before I knew you. But then,\n_I_ helped to mould you--a little--\"\n\nAnd resolutely Bettie said the most complimentary things about him. But\nI trapped her once.\n\n\"Still,\" I observed, when he had gone, and she had finished telling me\nhow delightful Mr. Charteris was, \"still he shan't ever come to _our_\nhouse, shall he?\"\n\n\"Why, of course not!\" said Bettie, who was meditating upon some cosmic\nquestion which required immediate attention. And then she grew very\nangry and said, \"Oh, you _dog!_\" and threw a sofa-cushion at me.\n\n\"I hate that wizened man,\" she presently volunteered, \"more bitterly\nthan I do any person on earth. For it was he who taught you to adopt\ninfancy as a profession. He robbed me. And Setebos permitted it. And now\nyou are just a man I am going to marry--Oh, well!\" said Bettie, more\nsprightlily, \"I was getting on, and you are rather a dear even in that\ncapacity. Only I wonder what _becomes_ of all the first choices?\"\n\n\"They must keep them for us somewhere, Bettie dear. And that is probably\nthe explanation of everything.\"\n\nAnd a hand had snuggled into mine. \"You do understand without having to\nhave it all spelt out for you. And that's a comfort, too. But, oh,\" said\nBettie, \"what a wasteful Setebos it is!\"\n\n\n\n\n29.\n\n_He Allows the Merits of Imperfection_\n\n\nI was quite contented now and assured as to the future. I foreknew the\nfuture would be tranquil and lacking in any particular excitement, and I\nhad already ceded, in anticipation, the last tittle of mastery over my\nown actions; but Bettie would keep me to the mark, would wring--not\npainlessly perhaps--from Robert Townsend the very best there was in him;\nand it would be this best which, unalloyed, would endure, in what I\nwrote. I had never imagined that, for the ore, smelting was an agreeable\nprocess; so I shrugged, and faced my future contentedly.\n\nOne day I said, \"To-morrow I must have holiday. There are certain things\nthat need burying, Bettie dear, and--it is just the funeral of my youth\nI want to go to.\"\n\n\"So it is to-morrow that we go for an admiring walk around our\nemotions!\" Bettie said. She knew well enough of what event to-morrow was\nthe anniversary, and it is to her credit she added: \"Well, for this\nonce--!\" For of all the women whom I had loved, there was but one that\nBettie Hamlyn had ever bothered about. And to-morrow was Stella's\nbirthday, as I had very unconcernedly mentioned a few moments earlier,\nwhen I was looking for the Austin Dobson book, and had my back turned\nto Bettie.\n\n\n 2\n\nNext day, in Cedarwood, a woman in mourning--in mourning fluffed and\njetted and furbelowed in such pleasing fashion that it seemed\nflamboyantly to demand immediate consolation of all marriageable\nmales,--viewed me with a roving eye as I heaped daffodils on Stella's\ngrave. They had cost me a pretty penny, too, for this was in September.\nBut then I must have daffodils, much as I loathe the wet, limp feel o.\nthem, because she would have chosen daffodils.... Well! I fancied this\nwoman thought me sanctioned by both church and law in what I did,--and\nviewed me in my supposedly recent bereavement and gauged my\npotentialities,--viewed me, in short, with the glance of adventurous\nwidowhood.\n\nMy faith (I meditated) if she knew!--if I could but speak my thought to\nher!\n\n\"Madam,\"--let us imagine me, my hat raised, my voice grave,--\"the woman\nwho lies here was a stranger to me. I did not know her. I knew that her\neyes were blue, that her hair was sunlight, that her voice had pleasing\nmodulations; but I did not know the woman. And she cared nothing for me.\nThat is why my voice shakes as I tell you of it. And I have brought her\ndaffodils, because of all flowers she loved them chiefly, and because\nthere is no one else who remembers this. It is the flower of spring, and\nStella--for that was her name, madam,--died in the spring of the year,\nin the spring of her life; and Stella would have been just twenty-six\nto-day. Oh, and daffodils, madam, are all white and gold, even as that\nhandful of dust beneath us was all white and gold when we buried it with\na flourish of crepe and lamentation, some two years and five months ago.\nYet the dust there was tender flesh at one time, and it clad a brave\nheart; but we thought of it--and I among the rest,--as a plaything with\nwhich some lucky man might while away his leisure hours. I believe now\nthat it was something more. I believe--ah, well, my _credo_ is of little\nconsequence. But whatever this woman may have been, I did not know her.\nAnd she cared nothing for me.\"\n\nI reflected I would like to do it. I could imagine the stare, the\nsquawk, the rustling furbelows, as madam fled from this grave madman.\nShe would probably have me arrested.\n\nYou see I had come to think differently of Stella. At times I remembered\nher childish vanity, her childish, morbid views, her childish gusts of\npetulance and anger and mirth; and I smiled,--oh, very tenderly, yet\nI smiled.\n\nThen would awake the memory of Stella and myself in that ancient\nmoonlight and of our first talk of death--two infants peering into\ninfinity, somewhat afraid, and puzzled; of Stella making tea in the\nfirelight, and prattling of her heart's secrets, half-seriously, half in\nfun; and of Stella striving to lift a very worthless man to a higher\nlevel and succeeding--yes, for the time, succeeding; and of Stella dying\nwith a light heart, elate with dreams of Peter Blagden's future and of\n\"a life that counted\"; and of what she told me at the very last. And,\nirrationally perhaps, there would seem to be a sequence in it all, and I\ncould not smile over it, not even tenderly.\n\nAnd I would depicture her, a foiled and wistful little wraith, very\nlonely in eternity, and a bit regretful of the world she loved and of\nits blundering men, and unhappy,--for she could never be entirely happy\nwithout Peter,--and I feared, indignant. For Stella desired very\nheartily to be remembered--she was vain, you know,--and they have all\nforgotten. Yes, I am sure that even as a wraith, Stella would be\nindignant, for she had a fine sense of her own merits.\n\n\"But I am just a little butterfly-woman,\" she would say, sadly; then,\nwith a quick smile, \"Aren't I?\" And her eyes would be like stars--like\nbig, blue stars,--and afterward her teeth would glint of a sudden, and\ninnumerable dimples would come into being, and I would know she was\nnever meant to be taken seriously....\n\nBut we must avoid all sickly sentiment.\n\nYou see the world had advanced since Stella died,--twice around the sun,\nfrom solstice to solstice, from spring to winter and back again,\ntravelling through I forget how many millions of miles; and there had\nbeen wars and scandals and a host of debutantes and any number of\ndinners; and, after all, the world is for the living.\n\nSo we of Lichfield agreed unanimously that it was very sad, and spoke of\nher for a while, punctiliously, as \"poor dear Stella\"; and the next week\nEmily Van Orden ran away with Tom Whately; and a few days later Alicia\nWade's husband died, and we debated whether Teddy Anstrother would do\nthe proper thing or sensibly marry Celia Reindan: and so, a little by a\nlittle, we forgot our poor, dear Stella in precisely the decorous\ngraduations of regret with which our poor dear Stella would have\nforgotten any one of us.\n\nYes, even those who loved her most deeply have forgotten Stella. They\nremember only an imaginary being who was entirely perfect, and of whom\nthey were not worthy. It is this fictitious woman who has usurped the\nreal Stella's place in the heart of the real Stella's own mother, and\nwhom even Lizzie d'Arlanges believes to have been once her sister, and\nover whom Peter Blagden is always ready to grow maudlin; and it is this\nimmaculate woman--who never existed,--that will be until the end of\nAvis' matrimonial existence the standard by which Avis is measured and\nfound wanting. And thus again the whirligig of time, by an odd turn,\nbrings in his revenges.\n\nAnd I? Well, I was very fond of Stella. And the woman they speak of\nto-day, in that hushed, hateful, sanctimonious voice, I must confess I\nnever knew. And of all persons I chiefly rage against that faultless\nangel, that \"poor dear Stella,\" who has pilfered even the paltry tribute\nof being remembered from the Stella that to-day is mine alone. For it is\nto this fictitious person that the people whom my Stella loved, as she\ndid not love me, now bring their flowers; and it was to this person they\nerected their pompous monument,--nay, more, it was for this atrocious\nwoman they ordered the very coffin in which my Stella lay when I last\nsaw her. And it is not fair.\n\nAnd I? Well, I was very fond of Stella. It would be good to have her\nback,--to have her back to jeer at me, to make me feel red and\nuncomfortable and ridiculous, to say rude things about my waist, and\nindeed to fluster me just by being there. Yes, it would be good. But,\nupon the whole, I am not sorry that Stella is gone.\n\nFor there is Peter Blagden to be considered. We can all agree to-day\nthat Peter is a good fellow, that he is making the most of his Uncle\nLarry's money, and that he is nobody's enemy but his own; and we have\nsmugly forgotten the time when we expected him to become a great lawyer.\nWe do not expect that of Peter now; instead, we are content\nenough--particularly since Peter has so admirably dressed his part by\ntaking to longish hair and gruffness and a cane,--to point him out to\nstrangers in Lichfield as \"one of our wealthiest men,\" and to elect him\nto all civic committees, and to discuss his semi-annual sprees and his\nmonetary relations with various women whom one does not \"know.\" And the\npresent Mrs. Blagden, too, appears content enough.\n\nAnd as Stella loved him--\n\nWell, as it was, Peter was then off on his honeymoon, and there was only\nI to bring the daffodils to Stella. She was always vain, was Stella; it\nwould have grieved her had no one remembered.\n\n\n 3\n\nThen I caught the afternoon train for Fairhaven, and went back to my\ncapable fiancee.\n\nBut I walked over to Willoughby Hall that night and found Charteris\nalone in his queer library, among the serried queer books and the\nportraits of his \"literary creditors.\" When I came into the apartment he\nwas mending a broken tea-cup, for he peculiarly delighted in such\ninfinitesimal task-work; but the vexed countenance at once took on the\nfond young look my coming would invariably provoke, and he shoved aside\nthe fragments....\n\nWe talked of trifles; apropos of nothing, Charteris said, \"Yes,--but,\nthen, I devoted the morning to drawing up my will.\" And I laughed over\nsuch forethought.\n\nThe man rose and with clenched fist struck upon the littered table. \"It\nis in the air. I swear to you that, somehow, _I_ have been warned. But\nalways I have been favoured--Why, man, I protest that never in my life\nhave I encountered any person in associating with whom I did not\ncondescend, with reason to back me! Yet today Death stands within arm's\nreach, and I have accomplished--some three or four little books! And\nyet--why, _Ashtaroth's Lackey_, now--Yes, by God! it is perfected speech\nsuch as few other men have ever written. I know it, and I do not care at\nall even though you piteous dullards should always lack the wit to\nrecognise and revere perfected speech when it confronts you. But\npresently I die! and there is nothing left of me save the inefficient\ntestimony of those three or four little books!\"\n\nI patted his shoulder and protested he had over-worked himself.\n\n\"Eh, well,\" he said, and with that easy laugh I knew of old; \"in any\nevent, I have been thinking for a whole two hours of my wife, and of how\nfrom the very beginning I have utilised her, and of how good and\ncredulous she is, and of how happy I have made her--! For I have made\nher happy. That is the preposterous part of it--\"\n\n\"Why, yes; Anne loves you very dearly. Oh, I think that everybody is\nirrationally fond of you, John. No, that is not a compliment, it is\nrather the reverse. It is simply an instance of what I have been\nbrooding over all this afternoon,--that we like people on account of\ntheir good qualities and love them on account of their defects. I\nhonestly believe that the cornerstone of affection is the agreeable\nperception of our superiority in some one point, at least, to the\nbeloved. And that is why so many people are fond of you, I think.\"\n\nHe laughed a little. \"And _de te fabula_--Yet I would distinguish. You\nthink me a futile person and not, as we will put it, a disastrously\ntruthful person, and so on through the entire list of all those\nso-called vices which are really just a habit of not doing this or that\nparticular thing. Well! it is no longer _a la mode_ to talk about\nGod,--yet I must confess to an old-fashioned faith in our Author's\nexistence and even in His amiability. I believe He placed me in this\ncolourful world, and that He is not displeased because I have spent\ntherein some forty-odd years pleasurably. Then too I have not wasted\nthat pleasure, I have philanthropically passed it on. I have bequeathed\nposterity the chance to spend an enjoyable half-hour or so over one or\ntwo little books. That is not much to claim, but it is something.\"\n\nJohn Charteris was talking to himself now.\n\n\"Had I instead the daily prayers of seven orphans, or the proud\nconsciousness of having always been afraid to do what I wanted\nto,--which I take to be the universally accredited insurance of a\nblissful eternity,--or even a whole half-column with portrait in the New\nYork papers to indicate what a loss my premature demise had been to\nAmerica,--or actually all three together, say, to exhibit as the\nincrement of this period, I honestly cannot imagine any of the more\nintelligent archangels lining up to cheer my entry into Paradise. I\nbelieve, however, that to be contented, to partake of the world's\namenities with moderation as a sauce, and to aggrieve no fellow-being,\nexcept in self-protection, and to make other people happy as often as\nyou find it possible, is a recipe for living that will pass muster even\nin heaven. There you have my creed; and it may not be impeccable, but I\nbelieve in it.\"\n\n\"You have forgotten something,\" I said, with a grin. \"'One must not\nthink too despondently nor too often of the grim Sheriff who arrives\nanon to dispossess you, no less than all the others, nor of any\nsubsequent and unpredictable legal adjustments.' See, here it is, your\nown words printed in the book.\"\n\n\"Dear me, did I say that? How nicely phrased it is! Well! you and I have\ndefiantly preserved the gallant attitude in an era not very favorable\nthereto. And we seem to prosper--as yet--\"\n\n\"But certainly! We are the highly exceptional round pegs that flourish\nlike green bay-trees in a square hole,\" I summed it up. \"Presently of\ncourse our place knoweth us not. But in the mean while--well, as it\nhappens, I was recalling to-day how adroitly I scaled the summit of\nhuman wisdom when I was only fourteen. For I said then, 'You can have a\nright good time first, any way, if you keep away from ugly things and\nfussy people.' And at twenty-five I stick to it.\"\n\n\"I wonder now if it is not at a price?\" said Charteris, rather\nmirthlessly. \"Either way, you have as yet the courage of the\nunconvicted. And you have managed, out of it all, to get together the\nmakings of an honest book. I do not generally believe in heaping\nflattery upon young authors, but if I had written that last book of\nyours it would not grieve me. Even so, I wonder--? But it is dreary\nhere, in this old house, with all my wife's high-minded ancestors\nchilling the air. Come, let us concoct some curious sort of drink.\"\n\nI looked at him compassionately. \"And have Bettie staying up to let me\nin and smelling it on me! You must be out of your head.\"\n\nAnd then Charteris laughed and derided me, and afterward we chatted for\na good two hours,--quite at random, and disposing of the most important\nsubjects, as was our usage when in argument, in a half-sentence.\n\nIt was excellent to have Charteris to talk against, and I enjoyed it.\nTaking him by and large, I loved the little fellow as I have loved no\nother man.\n\n\n\n\n30.\n\n_He Gilds the Weather-Vane_\n\n\nBut I would not go along with Charteris the next morning when he came by\nthe Hamlyns' on his way to King's College. I could not, because I was\nlabouring over a batch of proof-sheets; and as I laboured my admiration\nfor the very clever young man who had concocted this new book augmented\ncomfortably; so that I told Charteris he was a public nuisance, and\nplease to go to Tillietudlem.\n\nHe had procured the key to the Library,--for the College had not opened\nas yet,--and meant to borrow an odd volume or so of Lucian. Charteris\nhad evolved the fantastic notion of treating Lucian's Zeus as a tragic\nfigure. He sketched a sympathetic picture of the fallen despot, and of\nthe smokeless altars, girdled by a jeering rabble of so-called\nphilosophers, and of how irritating it must be to anybody to have your\nactual existence denied. Did I not see the pathos of poor Zeus's\nsituation with the god business practically \"cornered,\" and the Jews\ngetting all the trade?\n\nI informed him that the only pathos in life just at present was my\ninability to disprove, in default of abolishing, the existence of people\nwho bothered me when I was busy. So Charteris went away, just as Byam\nbrought the mail from the post-office.\n\n\n 2\n\nThere were two cheques from magazines. Life was very pleasant, in a\nquiet uneventful world. The _Fairhaven Gazette_ for the week had come,\ntoo, to indicate that, as usual, nothing of grave import was happening\nin an agreeably monotonous world. True, the Bulgarians were issuing an\nappeal to civilization on the ground that they objected to being\nmassacred, and cyclones were wrecking towns and killing quite a number\nof persons in Florida, and the strikes in Colorado were leading to\ndivers homicides; but in Fairhaven these things did not seem to matter.\nAnd so the front page of the _Gazette_ was, rightfully, reserved for\nPlans of the College for the Session of 1903-4....\n\nI looked again. The President was explaining that he had intended no\ndiscourtesy to Sir Thomas Lipton by declining to attend the\nSeawanhaka-Corinthian Yacht Club dinner; Major Delmar had failed to beat\nLou Dillon's time, on the same track; the National Dressmakers'\nAssociation had declared that the kangaroo walk and Gibson shoulders\nwould shortly be eschewed by all really fashionable women; and these\nmatters were more interesting, of course, but certainly no cause for\nexcitement. Well, I reflected, no news was good news proverbially; and I\nwas content to let the axiom pass.\n\nIn fine, there was nothing to worry over anywhere. And the book was\ngoing to be good, quite astonishingly good....\n\nAnd yonder Bettie waited for me, and I could hear the piano that\nproclaimed she was not idle. I was ineffably content; and at ease within\na rather kindly universe, taking it by and large....\n\n\"Quite a nice Setebos, after all! a big, fine generous-hearted fellow,\nwho doesn't bother to keep accounts to the last penny. I heartily\napprove of Setebos, and Bettie ought not to rag Him so. She would think\nit tremendously nice and boyish of me if I were to go impulsively and\ntell her something like that--\"\n\nSo I decided I had worked quite long enough.\n\n\n 3\n\nBut as I reached out toward the portieres, a man came into the room,\nentering from the hall-way. And I gave a little whistling sound of\nastonishment and hastened to him with extended hand.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I began; \"why, have you dropped from the moon?\"\n\n\"They--they told me you were here,\" said Jasper Hardress, and paused to\nmoisten his lips. \"My wife died, yonder in Montana, ten days ago last\nThursday,--yes, it was on a Tuesday she died, I think.\"\n\nAnd I was silent for a breathing-space. \"Yes?\" I said, at last; for I\nhad seen the shining thing in Jasper Hardress's hand, and I was\nwondering now why he had pocketed the toy, and for how long.\n\n\"It was of a fever she died. She was delirious,--oh, quite three days.\nAnd she talked in her delirium.\"\n\nI began to smile; it was like witnessing a play. \"Yonder is Bettie and\nmy one chance of manhood; and blind chance, just the machination of a\ntiny microbe, entraps me as I tread toward all this. I was wrong about\nSetebos. Heine was right; there is an Aristophanes in heaven.\"\n\nI said, aloud: \"Well, Hardress, you wouldn't have me dispute the\nveracity of a lady?\"\n\nBut the man did not appear to hear me. \"Oh, it was very horrible,\" he\nsaid. \"Oh, I would like you, first of all, to comprehend how horrible it\nwas. She was always calling--no, not calling exactly, but just moaning\none name, and over and over again. He had been so cruel, she said. He\ndidn't really care for anything, she said, except to write his hateful\nbooks. And I had loved her, you understand. And for three whole days I\nmust sit there and hear her tell of what another man had meant to her! I\nhave not been wholly sane, I think, since then, for I had loved her for\na long time. And her throat was so little that I often thought how easy\nit would be to stop the moaning and talking, but somehow I did not like\nto do it. And it isn't my honour that I mean to avenge. It is Gillian\nthat I must avenge,--Gillian who died because a coward had robbed her of\nthe will to live. For it was that in chief. Why, even you must\nunderstand that,\" he said, as though he pleaded with me.\n\nAnd yonder Bettie played,--with lithe fingers which caressed the keys\nrather than struck them, I remembered. And always at the back of my mind\nsome being that was not I was taking notes as to how unruffled the man\nwas; and I smiled a little, in recognition of the air, as Bettie began\n_The Funeral March of a Marionette_....\n\n\"Yes,\" I said; \"I think I understand. There is something to be advanced\nupon the other side perhaps; but that scarcely matters. You act within\nyour rights; and, besides, you have a pistol, and I haven't. I am\ngetting afraid, though, Jasper. I can't stand this much longer. So for\nGod's sake, make an end of this!\"\n\nJasper Hardress said: \"I mean to. But they told me he was here? Yes, I\nam sure that someone told me he was here.\"\n\nI think I must have reeled a little. I know my brain was working\nautomatically. Gillian Hardress had always called me Jack; and Jasper\nHardress was past reason; and yonder was Bettie, who had made life too\nfine and dear a thing to be relinquished....\n\n\"Jasper,\" someone was saying, and that someone seemed to laugh, \"we\naren't living in the Middle Ages, remember. No, just as I said, I cannot\nstand this nonsense any longer, and you must make an end of this\nfoolishness. Just on a bare suspicion--just on the ravings of a\ndelirious woman--! Why, she used to call _me_ Jack,--and I write\nbooks--Why, you might just as logically murder _me_!\"\n\n\"I thought at first it was you. Oh, only for a moment, boy. I was not\nquite sane, I think, for at first I suspected you of such treachery as\nin my sober senses I know you never dreamed of. And I had forgotten you\nwere just a child--But she was conscious at the end,\" said Jasper\nHardress, \"and when I--talked with her about what she had said in\ndelirium, she told me it was Charteris whose son we christened Jasper\nHardress some two years ago--\"\n\nI said: \"I never knew there was a child.\" But I was thinking of a\nhitherto unaccounted-for photograph.\n\n\"He only lived three months. I had always wanted a son. You cannot fancy\nhow proud I was of him.\" Hardress laughed here.\n\n\"And she told you it was Charteris! in the moment of death when--when\nyou were threatening me, she told you it was Charteris!\"\n\n\"It is different when you are dying. You see--Gillian knew that eternity\ndepended on what she said to me then--\" He spoke as with difficulty, and\nhe kept licking at restless lips.\n\n\"Yes,--she did believe that. And she told you--!\" I comprehended how\nGillian Hardress had loved me, and my shame was such that now it was the\nmere brute will to live which held me. But it held me, none the less.\nBesides, I saw the least unpleasant solution.\n\n\"I suppose I can't blame you,\" I said,--\"for if she told you, why, of\ncourse--\" Then I barked out: \"He was here a moment ago. You must have\ncome around one corner, in fact, just as he turned the other. You will\nfind him at Willoughby Hall, I suppose. He said he was going\nstraight home.\"\n\nFor I knew that Charteris was at King's College, a mile away from\nWilloughby Hall; and, I assured myself, there would be ample time to\nwarn him. Only how much must now depend upon the diverting qualities of\nLucian! For should the Samosatan flag in interest, John would be leaving\nthe College presently; and there is but one street in Fairhaven.\n\n\n 4\n\nI had my hand upon the garden-gate, and Hardress had just turned the\ncorner below, going toward Cambridge Street, when Bettie came upon\nthe porch.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"and who's your fat friend, Mr. Sheridan?\"\n\n\"I can't stop now, dear. I forgot to tell John about something which is\nrather important--\"\n\n\"Gracious!\" Bettie Hamlyn said; \"that sounds like shooting. Why, it is\nshooting, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\n\"--Quite as though the Monnachins and the Massawomeks and all the other\njaw-breakers were attacking Fairhaven as they used to do on alternate\nThursdays, and affording both of us an excellent opportunity to get\nnicely scalped in time for dinner. So I don't mind confessing that it\nwas against precisely such an emergency I declined to turn out an\nelaborate suite of hair; and now I expect the world at large to\nacknowledge that I acted very sensibly.\"\n\n\"It is much more likely to be some drunken country-man on his monthly\nspree--\" I was reflecting while Bettie talked nonsense that there had\nbeen no less than four shots. I was wondering whom the last was for. It\nwould be much pleasanter, all around, if Hardress had sent it into his\nown disordered brain. Yes, certainly, three bullets ought amply to\naccount for an unprepared and unarmed and puny Charteris....\n\nSo I said: \"Well, I suppose my business with John must wait for a while.\nBesides, Bettie, you are such a dear in that get-up. And if you will\ncome down into the garden at once, I will explain a few of my reasons\nfor advancing the assertion.\"\n\nStanding upon the porch, she patted me ever so lightly upon the head.\n\"What a child it is!\" she said. \"I don't think that, after all, I shall\nput twenty-six candles on your cake next week. The fat and lazy literary\ngent is not really old enough, not really more than ten.\"\n\n\"--And besides, apart from the proposed discussion of your physical\ncharms, I have something else quite equally important to tell\nyou about.\"\n\n\"Oh, drat the pertinacious infant, then I'll come for half an hour. Just\nwait until I get a hat. Still, what a worthless child it is! to be\nquitting work before noon.\"\n\nAnd she would have gone, but I detained her. \"Yes, what a worthless\nchild it is,--or rather, what an unproverbial sort of busy bee it has\nbeen, Bettie dear. For his has been the summer air, and the sunshine,\nand the flowers; and gentle ears have listened to him, and gentle eyes\nhave been upon him. Now it is autumn. And he has let others eat his\nhoney-which I take to include all that he actually made, all that wasn't\nin the world before he came, as Stella used to say,--so that he might\nhave his morsel and his song. And sometimes it has been Sardinian honey,\nvery bitter in the mouth,--and even then he has let others eat it--\"\n\n\"You are a most irrelevant infant,\" said Miss Hamlyn, \"with these\ninsectean divagations--Dear me, what lovely words! And of course if you\nreally want to drag me into that baking-hot garden, and have the only\nfiancee you just at present possess laid up by a sunstroke--\"\n\n\n\n\n_The Epilogue: Which Suggests that Second Thoughts--_\n\n\nSo I waited there alone. Whatever the four shots implied, I must tell\nBettie everything, because she was Bettie, and it was not fair I should\nhave any secrets from her. \"Oh, just be honest with me,\" she had said,\nin this same garden, \"and I don't care what you do!\" And I had never\nlied to Bettie: at worst, I simply had not told her anything concerning\nmatters about which I was glad she had not happened to ask any\nquestions. But this was different....\n\nDimly I knew that everything must pivot on my telling Bettie. John was\ndone for, the Hardress woman was done for, and whether or no Jasper had\ndone for himself, there was no danger, now, that anyone would ever know\nhow that infernal Gillian had badgered me into, probably, three\nhomicides. There might be some sort of supernal bookkeeping, somewhere,\nbut very certainly it was not conformable to any human mathematics....\nAnd therefore I must tell Bettie.\n\nI must tell Bettie, and abide what followed. She had pardoned much. It\nmight be she would pardon even this, \"because I had been honest with her\nwhen I didn't want to be.\" And in any event--even in her loathing,--\nBettie would understand, and know I had at least kept faith with her....\n\nI must tell Bettie, and abide what followed. For living seemed somehow\nto have raised barriers about me a little by a little, so that I must\nview and talk with all my fellows more and more remotely, and could not,\nas it were, quite touch anybody save Bettie. At all other persons I was\nbut grimacing falsely across an impalpable barrier. And now just such a\nbarrier was arising between Bettie and me, as I perceived in a sort of\npanic. Yes, it was rising resistlessly, like an augmenting mist not ever\nto be put aside, except by plunging forthwith into hours, or days, or\neven into months perhaps, of ugliness and discomfort....\n\nIt was the season of harvest. The leaves were not yet turned, and upon\nmy face the heatless, sun-steeped air was like a caress. The whole world\nwas at full-tide, ineffably sweet and just a little languorous: and bees\nwere audible, as in a humorous pretence of vexation....\n\nThe world was very beautiful. I must tell Bettie presently, of course;\nonly the world was such a comfortable place precisely as it was; and I\nbegan to wonder if I need tell Bettie after all?\n\nFor, after all, to tell the truth could resurrect nobody; and to know\nthe truth would certainly make Bettie very unhappy; and never in my life\nhave I been able to endure the contact of unhappiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Cords of Vanity, by \nJames Branch Cabell and Willson Follett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CORDS OF VANITY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9608-8.txt or 9608-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/9/6/0/9608/\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Virginia Paque, Anuradha Valsa,\nand Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
