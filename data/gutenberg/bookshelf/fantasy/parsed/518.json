Perhaps you\nwonder why it is that so many stories are told of \"once on a time\", and\nso few of these days in which we live; but that is easily explained.\n\nIn the old days, when the world was young, there were no automobiles\nnor flying-machines to make one wonder; nor were there railway trains,\nnor telephones, nor mechanical inventions of any sort to keep people\nkeyed up to a high pitch of excitement.  Men and women lived simply and\nquietly.  They were Nature's children, and breathed fresh air into\ntheir lungs instead of smoke and coal gas; and tramped through green\nmeadows and deep forests instead of riding in street cars; and went to\nbed when it grew dark and rose with the sun--which is vastly different\nfrom the present custom.  Having no books to read they told their\nadventures to one another and to their little ones; and the stories\nwere handed down from generation to generation and reverently believed.\n\nThose who peopled the world in the old days, having nothing but their\nhands to depend on, were to a certain extent helpless, and so the\nfairies were sorry for them and ministered to their wants patiently and\nfrankly, often showing themselves to those they befriended.\n\nSo people knew fairies in those days, my dear, and loved them, together\nwith all the ryls and knooks and pixies and nymphs and other beings\nthat belong to the hordes of immortals.  And a fairy tale was a thing\nto be wondered at and spoken of in awed whispers; for no one thought of\ndoubting its truth.\n\nTo-day the fairies are shy; for so many curious inventions of men have\ncome into use that the wonders of Fairyland are somewhat tame beside\nthem, and even the boys and girls can not be so easily interested or\nsurprised as in the old days.  So the sweet and gentle little immortals\nperform their tasks unseen and unknown, and live mostly in their own\nbeautiful realms, where they are almost unthought of by our busy,\nbustling world.\n\nYet when we come to story-telling the marvels of our own age shrink\ninto insignificance beside the brave deeds and absorbing experiences of\nthe days when fairies were better known; and so we go back to \"once on\na time\" for the tales that we most love--and that children have ever\nloved since mankind knew that fairies exist.\n\n\n\n2.  The Enchanted Isle\n\nOnce there was an enchanted island in the middle of the sea.  It was\ncalled the Isle of Yew.  And in it were five important kingdoms ruled\nby men, and many woodland dells and forest glades and pleasant meadows\nand grim mountains inhabited by fairies.\n\nFrom the fairies some of the men had learned wonderful secrets, and had\nbecome magicians and sorcerers, with powers so great that the entire\nisland was reputed to be one of enchantments.  Who these men were the\ncommon people did not always know; for while some were kings and\nrulers, others lived quietly hidden away in forests or mountains, and\nseldom or never showed themselves.  Indeed, there were not so many of\nthese magicians as people thought, only it was so hard to tell them\nfrom common folk that every stranger was regarded with a certain amount\nof curiosity and fear.\n\nThe island was round--like a mince pie.  And it was divided into four\nquarters--also like a pie--except that there was a big place in the\ncenter where the fifth kingdom, called Spor, lay in the midst of the\nmountains.  Spor was ruled by King Terribus, whom no one but his own\nsubjects had ever seen--and not many of them.  For no one was allowed\nto enter the Kingdom of Spor, and its king never left his palace.  But\nthe people of Spor had a bad habit of rushing down from their mountains\nand stealing the goods of the inhabitants of the other four kingdoms,\nand carrying them home with them, without offering any apologies\nwhatever for such horrid conduct.  Sometimes those they robbed tried to\nfight them; but they were a terrible people, consisting of giants with\nhuge clubs, and dwarfs who threw flaming darts, and the stern Gray Men\nof Spor, who were most frightful of all.  So, as a rule, every one fled\nbefore them, and the people were thankful that the fierce warriors of\nSpor seldom came to rob them oftener than once a year.\n\nIt was on this account that all who could afford the expense built\ncastles to live in, with stone walls so thick that even the giants of\nSpor could not batter them down.  And the children were not allowed to\nstray far from home for fear some roving band of robbers might steal\nthem and make their parents pay large sums for their safe return.\n\nYet for all this the people of the Enchanted Isle of Yew were happy and\nprosperous.  No grass was greener, no forests more cool and delightful,\nno skies more sunny, no sea more blue and rippling than theirs.\n\nAnd the nations of the world envied them, but dared not attempt to\nconquer an island abounding in enchantments.\n\n\n\n3.  The Fairy Bower\n\nThat part of the Enchanted Isle which was kissed by the rising sun was\ncalled Dawna; the kingdom that was tinted rose and purple by the\nsetting sun was known as Auriel, and the southland, where fruits and\nflowers abounded, was the kingdom of Plenta.  Up at the north lay Heg,\nthe home of the great barons who feared not even the men of Spor; and\nin the Kingdom of Heg our story opens.\n\nUpon a beautiful plain stood the castle of the great Baron\nMerd--renowned alike in war and peace, and second in importance only to\nthe King of Heg.  It was a castle of vast extent, built with thick\nwalls and protected by strong gates.  In front of it sloped a pretty\nstretch of land with the sea glistening far beyond; and back of it, but\na short distance away, was the edge of the Forest of Lurla.\n\nOne fair summer day the custodian of the castle gates opened a wicket\nand let down a draw-bridge, when out trooped three pretty girls with\nbaskets dangling on their arms.  One of the maids walked in front of\nher companions, as became the only daughter of the mighty Baron Merd.\nShe was named Seseley, and had yellow hair and red cheeks and big, blue\neyes.  Behind her, merry and laughing, yet with a distinct deference to\nthe high station of their young lady, walked Berna and Helda--dark\nbrunettes with mischievous eyes and slender, lithe limbs.  Berna was\nthe daughter of the chief archer, and Helda the niece of the captain of\nthe guard, and they were appointed play-fellows and comrades of the\nfair Seseley.\n\nUp the hill to the forest's edge ran the three, and then without\nhesitation plunged into the shade of the ancient trees.  There was no\nsunlight now, but the air was cool and fragrant of nuts and mosses, and\nthe children skipped along the paths joyously and without fear.\n\nTo be sure, the Forest of Lurla was well known as the home of fairies,\nbut Seseley and her comrades feared nothing from such gentle creatures\nand only longed for an interview with the powerful immortals whom they\nhad been taught to love as the tender guardians of mankind.  Nymphs\nthere were in Lurla, as well, and crooked knooks, it was said; yet for\nmany years past no person could boast the favor of meeting any one of\nthe fairy creatures face to face.\n\nSo, gathering a few nuts here and a sweet forest flower there, the\nthree maidens walked farther and farther into the forest until they\ncame upon a clearing--formed like a circle--with mosses and ferns for\nits carpet and great overhanging branches for its roof.\n\n\"How pretty!\" cried Seseley, gaily.  \"Let us eat our luncheon in this\nlovely banquet-hall!\"\n\nSo Berna and Helda spread a cloth and brought from their baskets some\ngolden platters and a store of food.  Yet there was little ceremony\nover the meal, you may be sure, and within a short space all the\nchildren had satisfied their appetites and were laughing and chatting\nas merrily as if they were at home in the great castle.  Indeed, it is\ncertain they were happier in their forest glade than when facing grim\nwalls of stone, and the three were in such gay spirits that whatever\none chanced to say the others promptly joined in laughing over.\n\nSoon, however, they were startled to hear a silvery peal of laughter\nanswering their own, and turning to see whence the sound proceeded,\nthey found seated near them a creature so beautiful that at once the\nthree pairs of eyes opened to their widest extent, and three hearts\nbeat much faster than before.\n\n\"Well, I must say you DO stare!\" exclaimed the newcomer, who was\nclothed in soft floating robes of rose and pearl color, and whose eyes\nshone upon them like two stars.\n\n\"Forgive our impertinence,\" answered the little Lady Seseley, trying to\nappear dignified and unmoved; \"but you must acknowledge that you came\namong us uninvited, and--and you are certainly rather odd in\nappearance.\"\n\nAgain the silvery laughter rang through the glade.\n\n\"Uninvited!\" echoed the creature, clapping her hands together\ndelightedly; \"uninvited to my own forest home!  Why, my dear girls, you\nare the uninvited ones--indeed you are--to thus come romping into our\nfairy bower.\"\n\nThe children did not open their eyes any wider on hearing this speech,\nfor they could not; but their faces expressed their amazement fully,\nwhile Helda gasped the words:\n\n\"A fairy bower!  We are in a fairy bower!\"\n\n\"Most certainly,\" was the reply.  \"And as for being odd in appearance,\nlet me ask how you could reasonably expect a fairy to appear as mortal\nmaidens do?\"\n\n\"A fairy!\" exclaimed Seseley.  \"Are you, then, a real fairy?\"\n\n\"I regret to say I am,\" returned the other, more soberly, as she patted\na moss-bank with a silver-tipped wand.\n\nThen for a moment there was silence, while the three girls sat very\nstill and stared at their immortal companion with evident curiosity.\nFinally Seseley asked:\n\n\"Why do you regret being a fairy?  I have always thought them the\nhappiest creatures in the world.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we ought to be happy,\" answered the fairy, gravely, \"for we\nhave wonderful powers and do much to assist you helpless mortals.  And\nI suppose some of us really are happy.  But, for my part, I am so\nutterly tired of a fairy life that I would do anything to change it.\"\n\n\"That is strange,\" declared Berna.  \"You seem very young to be already\ndiscontented with your lot.\"\n\nNow at this the fairy burst into laughter again, and presently asked:\n\n\"How old do you think me?\"\n\n\"About our own age,\" said Berna, after a glance at her and a moment's\nreflection.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" retorted the fairy, sharply.  \"These trees are hundreds of\nyears old, yet I remember when they were mere twigs.  And I remember\nwhen mortals first came to live upon this island, yes--and when this\nisland was first created and rose from the sea after a great\nearthquake.  I remember for many, many centuries, my dears.  I have\ngrown tired of remembering--and of being a fairy continually, without\nany change to brighten my life.\"\n\n\"To be sure!\" said Seseley, with sympathy.  \"I never thought of fairy\nlife in that way before.  It must get to be quite tiresome.\"\n\n\"And think of the centuries I must yet live!\" exclaimed the fairy in a\ndismal voice.  \"Isn't it an awful thing to look forward to?\"\n\n\"It is, indeed,\" agreed Seseley.\n\n\"I'd be glad to exchange lives with you,\" said Helda, looking at the\nfairy with intense admiration.\n\n\"But you can't do that,\" answered the little creature quickly.\n\"Mortals can't become fairies, you know--although I believe there was\nonce a mortal who was made immortal.\"\n\n\"But fairies can become anything they desire!\" cried Berna.\n\n\"Oh, no, they can't.  You are mistaken if you believe that,\" was the\nreply.  \"I could change YOU into a fly, or a crocodile, or a bobolink,\nif I wanted to; but fairies can't change themselves into anything else.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" murmured Seseley, much impressed.\n\n\"But YOU can,\" cried the fairy, jumping up and coming toward them.\n\"You are mortals, and, by the laws that govern us, a mortal can change\na fairy into anything she pleases.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Seseley, filled with amazement at the idea.\n\nThe fairy fell on her knees before the baron's daughter.\n\"Please--please, dear Seseley,\" she pleaded, \"change me into a mortal!\"\n\n\n\n4.  Prince Marvel\n\nIt is easy to imagine the astonishment of the three girls at hearing\nthis strange request.  They gazed in a bewildered fashion upon the\nkneeling fairy, and were at first unable to answer one word.  Then\nSeseley said--sadly, for she grieved to disappoint the pretty creature:\n\n\"We are but mortal children, and have no powers of enchantment at all.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is true, so far as concerns yourselves,\" replied the fairy,\neagerly; \"yet mortals may easily transform fairies into anything they\nwish.\"\n\n\"If that is so, why have we never heard of this power before?\" asked\nSeseley.\n\n\"Because fairies, as a rule, are content with their lot, and do not\nwish to appear in any form but their own.  And, knowing that evil or\nmischievous mortals can transform them at will, the fairies take great\ncare to remain invisible, so they can not be interfered with.  Have you\never,\" she asked, suddenly, \"seen a fairy before?\"\n\n\"Never,\" replied Seseley.\n\n\"Nor would you have seen me to-day, had I not known you were kind and\npure-hearted, or had I not resolved to ask you to exercise your powers\nupon me.\"\n\n\"I must say,\" remarked Helda, boldly, \"that you are foolish to wish to\nbecome anything different from what you are.\"\n\n\"For you are very beautiful NOW,\" added Berna, admiringly.\n\n\"Beautiful!\" retorted the fairy, with a little frown; \"what does beauty\namount to, if one is to remain invisible?\"\n\n\"Not much, that is true,\" agreed Berna, smoothing her own dark locks.\n\n\"And as for being foolish,\" continued the fairy, \"I ought to be allowed\nto act foolishly if I want to.  For centuries past I have not had a\nchance to do a single foolish thing.\"\n\n\"Poor dear!\" said Helda, softly.\n\nSeseley had listened silently to this conversation.  Now she inquired:\n\n\"What do you wish to become?\"\n\n\"A mortal!\" answered the fairy, promptly.\n\n\"A girl, like ourselves?\" questioned the baron's daughter.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the fairy, as if undecided.\n\n\"Then you would be likely to endure many privations,\" said Seseley,\ngently.  \"For you would have neither father nor mother to befriend you,\nnor any house to live in.\"\n\n\"And if you hired your services to some baron, you would be obliged to\nwash dishes all day, or mend clothing, or herd cattle,\" said Berna.\n\n\"But I should travel all over the island,\" said the fairy, brightly,\n\"and that is what I long to do.  I do not care to work.\"\n\n\"I fear a girl would not be allowed to travel alone,\" Seseley remarked,\nafter some further thought.  \"At least,\" she added, \"I have never heard\nof such a thing.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the fairy, rather bitterly, \"your men are the ones that roam\nabroad and have adventures of all kinds.  Your women are poor, weak\ncreatures, I remember.\"\n\nThere was no denying this, so the three girls sat silent until Seseley\nasked:\n\n\"Why do you wish to become a mortal?\"\n\n\"To gain exciting experiences,\" answered the fairy.  \"I'm tired of\nbeing a humdrum fairy year in and year out.  Of course, I do not wish\nto become a mortal for all time, for that would get monotonous, too;\nbut to live a short while as the earth people do would amuse me very\nmuch.\"\n\n\"If you want variety, you should become a boy,\" said Helda, with a\nlaugh, \"The life of a boy is one round of excitement.\"\n\n\"Then make me a boy!\" exclaimed the fairy eagerly.\n\n\"A boy!\" they all cried in consternation.  And Seseley added:\n\n\"Why--you're a GIRL fairy, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Well--yes; I suppose I am,\" answered the beautiful creature, smiling;\n\"but as you are going to change me anyway, I may as well become a boy\nas a girl.\"\n\n\"Better!\" declared Helda, clapping her hands; \"for then you can do as\nyou please.\"\n\n\"But would it be right?\" asked Seseley, with hesitation.\n\n\"Why not?\" retorted the fairy.  \"I can see nothing wrong in being a\nboy.  Make me a tall, slender youth, with waving brown hair and dark\neyes.  Then I shall be as unlike my own self as possible, and the\nadventure will be all the more interesting.  Yes; I like the idea of\nbeing a boy very much indeed.\"\n\n\"But I don't know how to transform you; some one will have to show me\nthe way to do it,\" protested Seseley, who was getting worried over the\ntask set her.\n\n\"Oh, that will be easy enough,\" returned the little immortal.  \"Have\nyou a wand?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I'll loan you mine, for I shall not need it.  And you must wave\nit over my head three times and say: 'By my mortal powers I transform\nyou into a boy for the space of one year'.\"\n\n\"One year!  Isn't that too long?\"\n\n\"It's a very short time to one who has lived thousands of years as a\nfairy.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" answered the baron's daughter.\n\n\"Now, I'll begin by doing a little transforming myself,\" said the\nfairy, getting upon her feet again, \"and you can watch and see how I do\nit.\"  She brushed a bit of moss from her gauzy skirts and continued:\n\"If I'm to become a boy I shall need a horse, you know.  A handsome,\nprancing steed, very fleet of foot.\"\n\nA moment she stood motionless, as if listening.  Then she uttered a low\nbut shrill whistle.\n\nThe three girls, filled with eager interest, watched her intently.\n\nPresently a trampling of footsteps was heard through the brushwood, and\na beautiful deer burst from the forest and fearlessly ran to the fairy.\nWithout hesitation she waved her wand above the deer's head and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"By all my fairy powers I command you to become a war-horse for the\nperiod of one year.\"\n\nInstantly the deer disappeared, and in its place was a handsome\ncharger, milk-white in color, with flowing mane and tail.  Upon its\nback was a saddle sparkling with brilliant gems sewn upon fine dressed\nleather.\n\nThe girls uttered cries of astonishment and delight, and the fairy said:\n\n\"You see, these transformations are not at all difficult.  I must now\nhave a sword.\"\n\nShe plucked a twig from a near-by tree and cast it upon the ground at\nher feet.  Again she waved her wand--and the twig turned to a gleaming\nsword, richly engraved, that seemed to the silent watchers to tremble\nslightly in its sheath, as if its heart of steel throbbed with hopes of\nbattles to come.\n\n\"And now I must have shield and armor,\" said the fairy, gaily.  \"This\nwill make a shield,\"--and she stripped a sheet of loose bark from a\ntree-trunk,--\"but for armor I must have something better.  Will you\ngive me your cloak?\"\n\nThis appeal was made to Seseley, and the baron's daughter drew her\nwhite velvet cloak from her shoulders and handed it to the fairy.  A\nmoment later it was transformed into a suit of glittering armor that\nseemed fashioned of pure silver inlaid with gold, while the sheet of\nbark at the same time became a handsome shield, with the figures of\nthree girls graven upon it.  Seseley recognized the features as those\nof herself and her comrades, and noted also that they appeared sitting\nat the edge of a forest, the great trees showing plainly in the\nbackground.\n\n\"I shall be your champion, you see,\" laughed the fairy, gleefully, \"and\nmaybe I shall be able to repay you for the loss of your cloak.\"\n\n\"I do not mind the cloak,\" returned the child, who had been greatly\ninterested in these strange transformations.  \"But it seems impossible\nthat a dainty little girl like you can ride this horse and carry these\nheavy arms.\"\n\n\"I'll not be a girl much longer,\" said the little creature.  \"Here,\ntake my wand, and transform me into a noble youth!\"\n\nAgain the pretty fairy kneeled before Seseley, her dainty, rounded\nlimbs of white and rose showing plainly through her gauzy attire.  And\nthe baron's daughter was suddenly inspired to be brave, not wishing to\ndisappoint the venturous immortal.  So she rose and took the magic wand\nin her hand, waving it three times above the head of the fairy.\n\n\"By my powers as a mortal,\" she said, marveling even then at the\nstrange speech, \"I command you to become a brave and gallant\nyouth--handsome, strong, fearless!  And such shall you remain for the\nspace of one year.\"\n\nAs she ceased speaking the fairy was gone, and a slender youth,\ndark-eyed and laughing, was holding her hand in his and kissing it\ngratefully.\n\n\"I thank you, most lovely maiden,\" he said, in a pleasant voice, \"for\ngiving me a place in the world of mortals.  I shall ride at once in\nsearch of adventure, but my good sword is ever at your service.\"\n\nWith this he gracefully arose and began to buckle on his magnificent\narmor and to fasten the sword to his belt.\n\nSeseley drew a long, sighing breath of amazement at her own powers, and\nturning to Berna and Helda she asked:\n\n\"Do I see aright?  Is the little fairy really transformed to this\nyouth?\"\n\n\"It certainly seems so,\" returned Helda, who, being unabashed by the\nmarvels she had beheld, turned to gaze boldly upon the young knight.\n\n\"Do you still remember that a moment ago you were a fairy?\" she\ninquired.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said he, smiling; \"and I am really a fairy now, being\nbut changed in outward form.  But no one must know this save\nyourselves, until the year has expired and I resume my true station.\nWill you promise to guard my secret?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" they exclaimed, in chorus.  For they were delighted, as any\nchildren might well be, at having so remarkable a secret to keep and\ntalk over among themselves.\n\n\"I must ask one more favor,\" continued the youth: \"that you give me a\nname; for in this island I believe all men bear names of some sort, to\ndistinguish them one from another.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Seseley, thoughtfully.  \"What were you called as a fairy?\"\n\n\"That does not matter in the least,\" he answered, hastily.  \"I must\nhave an entirely new name.\"\n\n\"Suppose we call him the Silver Knight,\" suggested Berna, as she eyed\nhis glistening armor.\n\n\"Oh, no!--that is no name at all!\" declared Helda.  \"We might better\ncall him Baron Strongarm.\"\n\n\"I do not like that, either,\" said the Lady Seseley, \"for we do not\nknow whether his arm is strong or not.  But he has been transformed in\na most astonishing and bewildering manner before our very eyes, and I\nthink the name of Prince Marvel would suit him very well.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" cried the youth, picking up his richly graven shield.\n\"The name seems fitting in every way.  And for a year I shall be known\nto all this island as Prince Marvel!\"\n\n\n\n5.  The King of Thieves\n\nOld Marshelm, the captain of the guard, was much surprised when he saw\nthe baron's daughter and her playmates approach her father's castle\nescorted by a knight in glittering armor.\n\nTo be sure it was a rather small knight, but the horse he led by the\nbridle was so stately and magnificent in appearance that old Marshelm,\nwho was an excellent judge of horses, at once decided the stranger must\nbe a personage of unusual importance.\n\nAs they came nearer the captain of the guard also observed the beauty\nof the little knight's armor, and caught the glint of jewels set in the\nhandle of his sword; so he called his men about him and prepared to\nreceive the knight with the honors doubtless due his high rank.\n\nBut to the captain's disappointment the stranger showed no intention of\nentering the castle.  On the contrary, he kissed the little Lady\nSeseley's hand respectfully, waved an adieu to the others, and then\nmounted his charger and galloped away over the plains.\n\nThe drawbridge was let down to permit the three children to enter, and\nthe great Baron Merd came himself to question his daughter.\n\n\"Who was the little knight?\" he asked.\n\n\"His name is Prince Marvel,\" answered Seseley, demurely.\n\n\"Prince Marvel?\" exclaimed the Baron.  \"I have never heard of him.\nDoes he come from the Kingdom of Dawna, or that of Auriel, or Plenta?\"\n\n\"That I do not know,\" said Seseley, with truth.\n\n\"Where did you meet him?\" continued the baron.\n\n\"In the forest, my father, and he kindly escorted us home.\"\n\n\"Hm!\" muttered the baron, thoughtfully.  \"Did he say what adventure\nbrought him to our Kingdom of Heg?\"\n\n\"No, father.  But he mentioned being in search of adventure.\"\n\n\"Oh, he'll find enough to busy him in this wild island, where every man\nhe meets would rather draw his sword than eat,\" returned the old\nwarrior, smiling.  \"How old may this Prince Marvel be?\"\n\n\"He looks not over fifteen years of age,\" said Seseley, uneasy at so\nmuch questioning, for she did not wish to be forced to tell an untruth.\n\"But it is possible he is much older,\" she added, beginning to get\nconfused.\n\n\"Well, well; I am sorry he did not pay my castle a visit,\" declared the\nbaron.  \"He is very small and slight to be traveling this dangerous\ncountry alone, and I might have advised him as to his welfare.\"\n\nSeseley thought that Prince Marvel would need no advice from any one as\nto his conduct; but she wisely refrained from speaking this thought,\nand the old baron walked away to glance through a slit in the stone\nwall at the figure of the now distant knight.\n\nPrince Marvel was riding swiftly toward the brow of the hill, and\nshortly his great war-horse mounted the ascent and disappeared on its\nfarther slope.\n\nThe youth's heart was merry and light, and he reflected joyously, as he\nrode along, that a whole year of freedom and fascinating adventure lay\nbefore him.\n\nThe valley in which he now found himself was very beautiful, the soft\ngrass beneath his horse's feet being sprinkled with bright flowers,\nwhile clumps of trees stood here and there to break the monotony of the\nlandscape.\n\nFor an hour the prince rode along, rejoicing in the free motion of his\nhorse and breathing in the perfume-laden air.  Then he found he had\ncrossed the valley and was approaching a series of hills.  These were\nbroken by huge rocks, the ground being cluttered with boulders of rough\nstone.  His horse speedily found a pathway leading through these rocks,\nbut was obliged to proceed at a walk, turning first one way and then\nanother as the path zigzagged up the hill.\n\nPresently, being engaged in deep thought and little noting the way,\nPrince Marvel rode between two high walls of rock standing so close\ntogether that horse and rider could scarcely pass between the sides.\nHaving traversed this narrow space some distance the wall opened\nsuddenly upon a level plat of ground, where grass and trees grew.  It\nwas not a very big place, but was surely the end of the path, as all\naround it stood bare walls so high and steep that neither horse nor man\ncould climb them.  In the side of the rocky wall facing the entrance\nthe traveler noticed a hollow, like the mouth of a cave, across which\nwas placed an iron gate.  And above the gateway was painted in red\nletters on the gray stone the following words:\n\n\n            WUL-TAKIM\n         KING OF THIEVES\n              ------\n        HIS TREASURE HOUSE\n             KEEP OUT\n\n\nPrince Marvel laughed on reading this, and after getting down from his\nsaddle he advanced to the iron gate and peered through its heavy bars.\n\n\"I have no idea who this Wul-Takim is,\" he said, \"for I know nothing at\nall of the ways of men outside the forest in which I have always dwelt.\nBut thieves are bad people, I am quite sure, and since Wul-Takim is the\nking of thieves he must be by far the worst man on this island.\"\n\nThen he saw, through the bars of the gate, that a great cavern lay\nbeyond, in which were stacked treasures of all sorts: rich cloths,\ngolden dishes and ornaments, gemmed coronets and bracelets, cleverly\nforged armor, shields and battle-axes.  Also there were casks and bales\nof merchandise of every sort.\n\nThe gate appeared to have no lock, so Prince Marvel opened it and\nwalked in.  Then he perceived, perched on the very top of a pyramid of\ncasks, the form of a boy, who sat very still and watched him with a\nlook of astonishment upon his face.\n\n\"What are you doing up there?\" asked the prince.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the boy.  \"If I moved the least little bit this pile of\ncasks would topple over, and I should be thrown to the ground.\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned the prince, \"what of it?\"\n\nBut just then he glanced at the ground and saw why the boy did not care\nto tumble down.  For in the earth were planted many swords, with their\nsharp blades pointing upward, and to fall upon these meant serious\nwounds and perhaps death.\n\n\"Oh, ho!\" cried Marvel; \"I begin to understand.  You are a prisoner.\"\n\n\"Yes; as you will also be shortly,\" answered the boy.  \"And then you\nwill understand another thing--that you were very reckless ever to\nenter this cave.\"\n\n\"Why?\" inquired the prince, who really knew little of the world, and\nwas interested in everything he saw and heard.\n\n\"Because it is the stronghold of the robber king, and when you opened\nthat gate you caused a bell to ring far down on the hillside.  So the\nrobbers are now warned that an enemy is in their cave, and they will\nsoon arrive to make you a prisoner, even as I am.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see!\" said the prince, with a laugh, \"It is a rather clever\ncontrivance; but having been warned in time I should indeed be foolish\nto be caught in such a trap.\"\n\nWith this he half drew his sword, but thinking that robbers were not\nworthy to be slain with its untarnished steel, he pushed it back into\nthe jeweled scabbard and looked around for another weapon.  A stout\noaken staff lay upon the ground, and this he caught up and ran with it\nfrom the cave, placing himself just beside the narrow opening that led\ninto this rock-encompassed plain.  For he quickly saw that this was the\nonly way any one could enter or leave the place, and therefore knew the\nrobbers were coming up the narrow gorge even as he had himself done.\n\nSoon they were heard stumbling along at a rapid pace, crying to one\nanother to make haste and catch the intruder.  The first that came\nthrough the opening received so sharp a blow upon the head from Prince\nMarvel's oak staff that he fell to the ground and lay still, while the\nnext was treated in a like manner and fell beside his comrade.\n\nPerhaps the thieves had not expected so sturdy an enemy, for they\ncontinued to rush through the opening in the rocks and to fall beneath\nthe steady blows of the prince's staff until every one of them lay\nsenseless before the victor.  At first they had piled themselves upon\none another very neatly; but the pile got so high at last that the\nprince was obliged to assist the last thieves to leap to the top of the\nheap before they completely lost their senses.\n\nI have no doubt our prince, feeling himself yet strange in the new form\nhe had acquired, and freshly transported from the forest glades in\nwhich he had always lived, was fully as much astonished at his deed of\nvalor as were the robbers themselves; and if he shuddered a little when\nlooking upon the heap of senseless thieves you must forgive him this\nweakness.  For he straightway resolved to steel his heart to such\nsights and to be every bit as stern and severe as a mortal knight would\nhave been.\n\nThrowing down his staff he ran to the cave again, and stepping between\nthe sword points he approached the pile of casks and held out his arms\nto the boy who was perched upon the top.\n\n\"The thieves are conquered,\" he cried.  \"Jump down!\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Why not?\" inquired the prince.\n\n\"Can't you see I'm very miserable?\" asked the boy, in return; \"don't\nyou understand that every minute I expect to fall upon those sword\npoints?\"\n\n\"But I will catch you,\" cried the prince.\n\n\"I don't want you to catch me,\" said the boy.  \"I want to be miserable.\nIt's the first chance I've ever had, and I'm enjoying my misery very\nmuch.\"\n\nThis speech so astonished Prince Marvel that for a moment he stood\nmotionless.  Then he retorted, angrily:\n\n\"You're a fool!\"\n\n\"If I wasn't so miserable up here, I'd come down and thrash you for\nthat,\" said the boy, with a sigh.\n\nThis answer so greatly annoyed Prince Marvel that he gave the central\ncask of the pyramid a sudden push, and the next moment the casks were\ntumbling in every direction, while the boy fell headlong in their midst.\n\nBut Marvel caught him deftly in his arms, and so saved him from the\nsword points.\n\n\"There!\" he said, standing the boy upon his feet; \"now you are released\nfrom your misery.\"\n\n\"And I should be glad to punish you for your interference,\" declared\nthe boy, gloomily eying his preserver, \"had you not saved my life by\ncatching me.  According to the code of honor of knighthood I can not\nharm one who has saved my life until I have returned the obligation.\nTherefore, for the present I shall pardon your insulting speeches and\nactions.\"\n\n\"But you have also saved my life,\" answered Prince Marvel; \"for had you\nnot warned me of the robbers' return they would surely have caught me.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the boy, brightening up; \"therefore our score is now even.\nBut take care not to affront me again, for hereafter I will show you no\nmercy!\"\n\nPrince Marvel looked at the boy with wonder.  He was about his own\nsize, yet strong and well formed, and he would have been handsome\nexcept for the expression of discontent upon his face.  Yet his manner\nand words were so absurd and unnatural that the prince was more amused\nthan angered by his new acquaintance, and presently laughed in his face.\n\n\"If all the people in this island are like you,\" he said, \"I shall have\nlots of fun with them.  And you are only a boy, after all.\"\n\n\"I'm bigger than you!\" declared the other, glaring fiercely at the\nprince.\n\n\"How much bigger?\" asked Marvel, his eyes twinkling.\n\n\"Oh, ever so much!\"\n\n\"Then fetch along that coil of rope, and follow me,\" said Prince Marvel.\n\n\"Fetch the rope yourself!\" retorted the boy, bluntly.  \"I'm not your\nservant.\" Then he put his hands in his pockets and coolly walked out of\nthe cave to look at the pile of senseless robbers.\n\nPrince Marvel made no reply, but taking the coil of rope on his\nshoulder he carried it to where the thieves lay and threw it down\nbeside them.  Then he cut lengths from the coil with his sword and\nbound the limbs of each robber securely.  Within a half-hour he had\nlaid out a row of thieves extending half way across the grassy plain,\nand on counting their number he found he had captured fifty-nine of\nthem.\n\nThis task being accomplished and the robbers rendered helpless, Prince\nMarvel turned to the boy who stood watching him.\n\n\"Get a suit of armor from the cave, and a strong sword, and then return\nhere,\" he said, in a stern voice.\n\n\"Why should I do that?\" asked the boy, rather impudently.\n\n\"Because I am going to fight you for disobeying my orders; and if you\ndo not protect yourself I shall probably kill you.\"\n\n\"That sounds pleasant,\" said the boy.  \"But if you should prove my\nsuperior in skill I beg you will not kill me at once, but let me die a\nlingering death.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the prince.\n\n\"Because I shall suffer more, and that will be delightful.\"\n\n\"I am not anxious to kill you, nor to make you suffer,\" said Marvel,\n\"all that I ask is that you acknowledge me your master.\"\n\n\"I won't!\" answered the boy.  \"I acknowledge no master in all the\nworld!\"\n\n\"Then you must fight,\" declared the prince, gravely.  \"If you win, I\nwill promise to serve you faithfully; and if I conquer you, then you\nmust acknowledge me your master, and obey my commands.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" cried the boy, with sudden energy, and he rushed into the\ncave and soon returned clad in armor and bearing a sword and shield.\nOn the shield was pictured a bolt of lightning.\n\n\"Lightning will soon strike those three girls whose champion you seem\nto be,\" he said tauntingly.\n\n\"The three girls defy your lightning!\" returned the prince with a\nsmile.  \"I see you are brave enough.\"\n\n\"Brave!  Why should I not be?\" answered the boy proudly.  \"I am the\nLord Nerle, the son of Neggar, the chief baron of Heg!\"\n\nThe other bowed low.\n\n\"I am pleased to know your station,\" he said.  \"I am called Prince\nMarvel, and this is my first adventure.\"\n\n\"And likely to be your last,\" exclaimed the boy, sneeringly.  \"For I am\nstronger than you, and I have fought many times with full grown men.\"\n\n\"Are you ready?\" asked Prince Marvel, for answer.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThen the swords clashed and sparks flew from the blades.  But it was\nnot for long.  Suddenly Nerle's sword went flying through the air and\nshattered its blade against a wall of rock.  He scowled at Prince\nMarvel a moment, who smiled back at him.  Then the boy rushed into the\ncave and returned with another sword.\n\nScarcely had the weapons crossed again when with a sudden blow Prince\nMarvel snapped Nerle's blade in two, and followed this up with a sharp\nslap upon his ear with the flat of his own sword that fairly bewildered\nthe boy, and made him sit down on the grass to think what had happened\nto him.\n\nThen Prince Marvel's merry laugh rang far across the hills, and so\ndelighted was he at the astonished expression upon Nerle's face that it\nwas many minutes before he could control his merriment and ask his\nfoeman if he had had enough fight.\n\n\"I suppose I have,\" replied the boy, rubbing his ear tenderly.  \"That\nblow stings most deliciously.  But it is a hard thought that the son of\nBaron Neggar should serve Prince Marvel!\"\n\n\"Do not worry about that,\" said the prince; \"for I assure you my rank\nis so far above your own that it is no degradation for the son of\nNeggar to serve me.  But come, we must dispose of these thieves.  What\nis the proper fate for such men?\"\n\n\"They are always hanged,\" answered Nerle, getting upon his feet.\n\n\"Well, there are trees handy,\" remarked the prince, although his\ngirlish heart insisted on making him shiver in spite of his resolve to\nbe manly and stern.  \"Let us get to work and hang them as soon as\npossible.  And then we can proceed upon our journey.\"\n\nNerle now willingly lent his assistance to his new master, and soon\nthey had placed a rope around the neck of each thief and were ready to\ndangle them all from the limbs of the trees.\n\nBut at this juncture the thieves began to regain consciousness, and now\nWul-Takim, the big, red-bearded king of the thieves, sat up and asked:\n\n\"Who is our conqueror?\"\n\n\"Prince Marvel,\" answered Nerle.\n\n\"And what army assisted him?\" inquired Wul-Takim, curiously gazing upon\nthe prince.\n\n\"He conquered you alone and single-handed,\" said Nerle.\n\nHearing this, the big king began to weep bitterly, and the tear-drops\nran down his face in such a stream that Prince Marvel ordered Nerle to\nwipe them away with his handkerchief, as the thief's hands were tied\nbehind his back.\n\n\"To think!\" sobbed Wul-Takim, miserably; \"only to think, that after all\nmy terrible deeds and untold wickedness, I have been captured by a mere\nboy!  Oh, boo-hoo! boo-hoo! boo-hoo!  It is a terrible disgrace!\"\n\n\"You will not have to bear it long,\" said the prince, soothingly.  \"I\nam going to hang you in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Thanks!  Thank you very much!\" answered the king, ceasing to weep.  \"I\nhave always expected to be hanged some day, and I am glad no one but\nyou two boys will witness me when my feet begin kicking about.\"\n\n\"I shall not kick,\" declared another of the thieves, who had also\nregained his senses.  \"I shall sing while I am being hanged.\"\n\n\"But you can not, my good Gunder,\" protested the king; \"for the rope\nwill cut off your breath, and no man can sing without breath.\"\n\n\"Then I shall whistle,\" said Gunder, composedly.\n\nThe king cast at him a look of reproach, and turning to Prince Marvel\nhe said:\n\n\"It will be a great task to string up so many thieves.  You look tired.\nPermit me to assist you to hang the others, and then I will climb into\na tree and hang myself from a strong branch, with as little bother as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Oh, I won't think of troubling you,\" exclaimed Marvel, with a laugh.\n\"Having conquered you alone, I feel it my duty to hang you without\nassistance--save that of my esquire.\"\n\n\"It's no trouble, I assure you; but suit your own convenience,\" said\nthe thief, carelessly.  Then he cast his eye toward the cave and asked:\n\"What will you do with all our treasure?\"\n\n\"Give it to the poor,\" said Prince Marvel, promptly.\n\n\"What poor?\"\n\n\"Oh, the poorest people I can find.\"\n\n\"Will you permit me to advise you in this matter?\" asked the king of\nthieves, politely.\n\n\"Yes, indeed; for I am a stranger in this land,\" returned the prince.\n\n\"Well, I know a lot of people who are so poor that they have no\npossessions whatever, neither food to eat, houses to live in, nor any\nclothing but that which covers their bodies.  They can call no man\nfriend, nor will any lift a hand to help them.  Indeed, good sir, I\nverily believe they will soon perish miserably unless you come to their\nassistance!\"\n\n\"Poor creatures!\" exclaimed Prince Marvel, with ready sympathy; \"tell\nme who they are, and I will divide amongst them all your ill-gotten\ngains.\"\n\n\"They are ourselves,\" replied the king of thieves, with a sigh.\n\nMarvel looked at him in amazement, and then burst into joyous laughter.\n\n\"Yourselves!\" he cried, greatly amused.\n\n\"Indeed, yes!\" said Wul-Takim, sadly.  \"There are no poorer people in\nall the world, for we have ropes about our necks and are soon to be\nhanged.  To-morrow we shall not have even our flesh left, for the crows\nwill pick our bones.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" remarked Marvel, thoughtfully.  \"But, if I restore to\nyou the treasure, how will it benefit you, since you are about to die?\"\n\n\"Must you really hang us?\" asked the thief.\n\n\"Yes; I have decreed it, and you deserve your fate.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you have wickedly taken from helpless people their property,\nand committed many other crimes besides.\"\n\n\"But I have reformed!  We have all reformed--have we not, brothers?\"\n\n\"We have!\" answered the other thieves, who, having regained their\nsenses, were listening to this conversation with much interest.\n\n\"And, if you will return to us our treasure, we will promise never to\nsteal again, but to remain honest men and enjoy our wealth in peace,\"\npromised the king.\n\n\"Honest men could not enjoy treasures they have stolen,\" said Prince\nMarvel.\n\n\"True; but this treasure is now yours, having been won by you in fair\nbattle.  And if you present it to us it will no longer be stolen\ntreasure, but a generous gift from a mighty prince, which we may enjoy\nwith clear consciences.\"\n\n\"Yet there remains the fact that I have promised to hang you,\"\nsuggested Prince Marvel, with a smile, for the king amused him greatly.\n\n\"Not at all!  Not at all!\" cried Wul-Takim.  \"You promised to hang\nfifty-nine thieves, and there is no doubt the fifty-nine thieves\ndeserved to be hung.  But, consider!  We have all reformed our ways and\nbecome honest men; so it would be a sad and unkindly act to hang\nfifty-nine honest men!\"\n\n\"What think you, Nerle?\" asked the Prince, turning to his esquire.\n\n\"Why, the rogue seems to speak truth,\" said Nerle, scratching his head\nwith a puzzled air, \"yet, if he speaks truth, there is little\ndifference between a rogue and an honest man.  Ask him, my master, what\ncaused them all to reform so suddenly.\"\n\n\"Because we were about to die, and we thought it a good way to save our\nlives,\" replied the robber king.\n\n\"That's an honest answer, anyway,\" said Nerle.  \"Perhaps, sir, they\nhave really reformed.\"\n\n\"And if so, I will not have the death of fifty-nine honest men on my\nconscience,\" declared the prince.  Then he turned to Wul-Takim and\nadded: \"I will release you and give you the treasure, as you request.\nBut you owe me allegiance from this time forth, and if I ever hear of\nyour becoming thieves again, I promise to return and hang every one of\nyou.\"\n\n\"Never fear!\" answered Wul-Takim, joyfully.  \"It is hard work to steal,\nand while we have so much treasure it is wholly unnecessary.  Moreover,\nhaving accepted from you our lives and our fortunes, we shall hereafter\nbe your devoted servants, and whenever you need our services you have\nbut to call upon us, and we will support you loyally and gladly.\"\n\n\"I accept your service,\" answered the prince, graciously.\n\nAnd then he unbound the fifty-nine honest men and took the ropes from\ntheir necks.  As nightfall was fast approaching the new servants set to\nwork to prepare a great feast in honor of their master.  It was laid in\nthe middle of the grassy clearing, that all might sit around and\ncelebrate the joyous occasion.\n\n\"Do you think you can trust these men?\" asked Nerle, suspiciously.\n\n\"Why not?\" replied the prince.  \"They have been exceedingly wicked, it\nis true; but they are now intent upon being exceedingly good.  Let us\nencourage them in this.  If we mistrusted all who have ever done an\nevil act there would be fewer honest people in the world.  And if it\nwere as interesting to do a good act as an evil one there is no doubt\nevery one would choose the good.\"\n\n\n\n6.  The Troubles of Nerle\n\nThat night Prince Marvel slept within the cave, surrounded by the\nfifty-nine reformed thieves, and suffered no harm at their hands.  In\nthe morning, accompanied by his esquire, Nerle, who was mounted upon a\nspirited horse brought him by Wul-Takim, he charged the honest men to\nremember their promises, bade them good by, and set out in search of\nfurther adventure.\n\nAs they left the clearing by the narrow passage that led between the\noverhanging rocks, the prince looked back and saw that the sign above\nthe gate of the cave, which had told of the thieves' treasure house,\nhad been changed.  It now read as follows:\n\n\n            WUL-TAKIM\n        KING OF HONEST MEN\n              ------\n        HIS PLEASURE HOUSE\n             WALK IN\n\n\n\"That is much better,\" laughed the prince.  \"I accomplished some good\nby my adventure, anyway!\"\n\nNerle did not reply.  He seemed especially quiet and thoughtful as he\nrode by his master's side, and after they had traveled some distance in\nsilence Prince Marvel said:\n\n\"Tell me how you came to be in the cave of thieves, and perched upon\nthe casks where I found you.\"\n\n\"It is a sad story,\" returned Nerle, with a sigh; \"but since you\nrequest me to tell it, the tale may serve to relieve the tedium of your\njourney.\n\n\"My father is a mighty baron, very wealthy and with a heart so kind\nthat he has ever taken pleasure in thrusting on me whatever gift he\ncould think of.  I had not a single desire unsatisfied, for before I\ncould wish for anything it was given me.\n\n\"My mother was much like my father.  She and her women were always\nmaking jams, jellies, candies, cakes and the like for me to eat; so I\nnever knew the pleasure of hunger.  My clothes were the gayest satins\nand velvets, richly made and sewn with gold and silver braid; so it was\nimpossible to wish for more in the way of apparel.  They let me study\nmy lessons whenever I felt like it and go fishing or hunting as I\npleased; so I could not complain that I was unable to do just as I\nwanted to.  All the servants obeyed my slightest wish: if I wanted to\nsit up late at night no one objected; if I wished to lie in bed till\nnoon they kept the house quiet so as not to disturb me.\n\n\"This condition of affairs, as you may imagine, grew more and more\ntedious and exasperating the older I became.  Try as I might, I could\nfind nothing to complain of.  I once saw the son of one of our servants\nreceive a flogging; and my heart grew light.  I immediately begged my\nfather to flog me, by way of variety; and he, who could refuse me\nnothing, at once consented.  For this reason there was less\nsatisfaction in the operation than I had expected, although for the\ntime being it was a distinct novelty.\n\n\"Now, no one could expect a high-spirited boy to put up with such a\nlife as mine.  With nothing to desire and no chance of doing anything\nthat would annoy my parents, my days were dreary indeed.\"\n\nHe paused to wipe the tears from his eyes, and the prince murmured,\nsympathetically: \"Poor boy!  Poor boy!\"\n\n\"Ah, you may well say that!\" continued Nerle.  \"But one day a stranger\ncame to my father's castle with tales of many troubles he had met with.\nHe had been lost in a forest and nearly starved to death.  He had been\nrobbed and beaten and left wounded and sore by the wayside.  He had\nbegged from door to door and been refused food or assistance.  In\nshort, his story was so delightful that it made me envy him, and I\nyearned to suffer as he had done.  When I could speak with him alone I\nsaid: 'Pray tell me how I can manage to acquire the misfortunes you\nhave undergone.  Here I have everything that I desire, and it makes me\nvery unhappy.'\n\n\"The stranger laughed at me, at first; and I found some pleasure in the\nhumiliation I then felt.  But it did not last long, for presently he\ngrew sober and advised me to run away from home and seek adventure.\n\n\"'Once away from your father's castle,' said he, 'troubles will fall\nupon you thick enough to satisfy even your longings.'\n\n\"'That is what I am afraid of!' I answered.  'I don't want to be\nsatisfied, even with troubles.  What I seek is unsatisfied longings.'\n\n\"'Nevertheless,' said he, 'I advise you to travel.  Everything will\nprobably go wrong with you, and then you will be happy.'\n\n\"I acted upon the stranger's advice and ran away from home the next\nday.  After journeying a long time I commenced to feel the pangs of\nhunger, and was just beginning to enjoy myself when a knight rode by\nand gave me a supply of food.  At this rebuff I could not restrain my\ntears, but while I wept my horse stumbled and threw me over his head.\nI hoped at first I had broken my neck, and was just congratulating\nmyself upon the misfortune, when a witch-woman came along and rubbed\nsome ointment upon my bruises, in spite of my protests.  To my great\ngrief the pain left me, and I was soon well again.  But, as a slight\ncompensation for my disappointment, my horse had run away; so I began\nmy journey anew and on foot.\n\n\"That afternoon I stepped into a nest of wasps, but the thoughtless\ncreatures flew away without stinging me.  Then I met a fierce tiger,\nand my heart grew light and gay.  'Surely this will cause me\nsuffering!' I cried, and advanced swiftly upon the brute.  But the\ncowardly tiger turned tail and ran to hide in the bushes, leaving me\nunhurt!\n\n\"Of course, my many disappointments were some consolation; but not\nmuch.  That night I slept on the bare ground, and hoped I should catch\na severe cold; but no such joy was to be mine.\n\n\"Yet the next afternoon I experienced my first pleasure.  The thieves\ncaught me, stripped off all my fine clothes and jewels and beat me\nwell.  Then they carried me to their cave, dressed me in rags, and\nperched me on the top of the casks, where the slightest movement on my\npart would send me tumbling among the sword points.  This was really\ndelightful, and I was quite happy until you came and released me.\n\n\"I thought then that I might gain some pleasure by provoking you to\nanger; and our fight was the result.  That blow on the ear was\nexquisite, and by forcing me to become your servant you have made me,\nfor the first time in my life, almost contented.  For I hope in your\ncompany to experience a great many griefs and disappointments.\"\n\nAs Nerle concluded his story Prince Marvel turned to him and grasped\nhis hand.\n\n\"Accept my sympathy!\" said he.  \"I know exactly how you feel, for my\nown life during the past few centuries has not been much different.\"\n\n\"The past few centuries!\" gasped Nerle.  \"What do you mean?\"\n\nAt this the prince blushed, seeing he had nearly disclosed his secret.\nBut he said, quickly:\n\n\"Does it not seem centuries when one is unhappy?\"\n\n\"It does, indeed!\" responded Nerle, earnestly.  \"But please tell me\nyour story.\"\n\n\"Not now,\" said Prince Marvel, with a smile.  \"It will please you to\ndesire in vain to hear a tale I will not tell.  Yet I promise that on\nthe day we part company I shall inform you who I am.\"\n\n\n\n7.  The Gray Men\n\nThe adventurers gave no heed to the path they followed after leaving\nthe cave of the reformed thieves, but their horses accidentally took\nthe direction of the foot-hills that led into the wild interior Kingdom\nof Spor.  Therefore the travelers, when they had finished their\nconversation and begun to look about them, found themselves in a\nrugged, mountainous country that was wholly unlike the green plains of\nHeg they had left behind.\n\nNow, as I have before said, the most curious and fearful of the island\npeople dwelt in this Kingdom of Spor.  They held no friendly\ncommunication with their neighbors, and only left their own mountains\nto plunder and rob; and so sullen and fierce were they on these\noccasions that every one took good care to keep out of their way until\nthey had gone back home again.\n\nThere was much gossip about the unknown king of Spor, who had never yet\nbeen seen by any one except his subjects; and some thought he must be\none of the huge giants of Spor; and others claimed he was a dwarf, like\nhis tiny but ferocious dart-slingers; and still others imagined him one\nof the barbarian tribe, or a fellow to the terrible Gray Men.  But, of\ncourse, no one knew positively, and all these guesses were very wide of\nthe mark.  The only certainty about this king was that his giants,\ndwarfs, barbarians and Gray Men meekly acknowledged his rule and obeyed\nhis slightest wish; for though they might be terrible to others, their\nking was still more terrible to them.\n\nInto this Kingdom of Spor Prince Marvel and Nerle had now penetrated\nand, neither knowing nor caring where they were, continued along the\nfaintly defined paths the horses had found.  Presently, however, they\nwere startled by a peal of shrill, elfish laughter, and raising their\neyes they beheld a horrid-looking old man seated upon a high rock near\nby.\n\n\"Why do you laugh?\" asked Prince Marvel, stopping his horse.\n\n\"Have you been invited?  Tell me--have you been invited?\" demanded the\nold man, chuckling to himself as if much amused.\n\n\"Invited where?\" inquired the prince.\n\n\"To Spor, stupid!  To the Kingdom of Spor!  To the land of King\nTerribus!\" shrieked the old man, going into violent peals of laughter.\n\n\"We go and come as we please,\" answered Prince Marvel, calmly.\n\n\"Go--yes!  Go if you will.  But you'll never come back--never! never!\nnever!\" The little old man seemed to consider this such a good joke\nthat he bent nearly double with laughing, and so lost his balance and\ntoppled off the rock, disappearing from their view; but they could hear\nhim laugh long after they had passed on and left him far behind them.\n\n\"A strange creature!\" exclaimed the prince thoughtfully.\n\n\"But perhaps he speaks truth,\" answered Nerle, \"if, in fact, we have\nbeen rash enough to enter the Kingdom of Spor.  Even my father, the\nbravest baron in Heg, has never dared venture within the borders of\nSpor.  For all men fear its mysterious king.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" replied Prince Marvel, \"it is time some one\ninvestigated this strange kingdom.  People have left King Terribus and\nhis wild subjects too much to themselves; instead of stirring them up\nand making them behave themselves.\"\n\nNerle smiled at this speech.\n\n\"They are the fiercest people on the Enchanted Island,\" said he, \"and\nthere are thousands upon thousands who obey this unknown king.  But if\nyou think we dare defy them I am willing to go on.  Perhaps our\nboldness will lead them into torturing me, or starving me to death; and\nat the very least I ought to find much trouble and privation in the\nKingdom of Spor.\"\n\n\"Time will determine that,\" said the prince, cheerfully.\n\nThey had now ridden into a narrow defile of the mountains, the pathway\nbeing lined with great fragments of rock.  Happening to look over his\nshoulder Prince Marvel saw that as they passed these rocks a man\nstepped from behind each fragment and followed after them, their\nnumbers thus constantly increasing until hundreds were silently\ntreading in the wake of the travelers.\n\nThese men were very peculiar in appearance, their skins being as gray\nas the rocks themselves, while their only clothing consisted of gray\ncloth tunics belted around the waists with bands of gray fox-hide.\nThey bore no weapons except that each was armed with a fork, having\nthree sharp tines six inches in length, which the Gray Men carried\nstuck through their fox-hide belts.\n\nNerle also looked back and saw the silent throng following them, and\nthe sight sent such a cold shiver creeping up his spine that he smiled\nwith pleasure.  There was no way to avoid the Gray Men, for the path\nwas so narrow that the horsemen could not turn aside; but Prince Marvel\nwas not disturbed, and seemed not to mind being followed, so long as no\none hindered his advance.\n\nHe rode steadily on, Nerle following, and after climbing upward for a\nlong way the path began to descend, presently leading them into a\nvalley of wide extent, in the center of which stood an immense castle\nwith tall domes that glittered as if covered with pure gold.  A broad\nroadway paved with white marble reached from the mountain pass to the\nentrance of this castle, and on each side of this roadway stood lines\nof monstrous giants, armed with huge axes thrust into their belts and\nthick oak clubs, studded with silver spikes, which were carried over\ntheir left shoulders.\n\nThe assembled giants were as silent as the Gray Men, and stood\nmotionless while Prince Marvel and Nerle rode slowly up the marble\nroadway.  But all their brows were scowling terribly and their eyes\nwere red and glaring--as if they were balls of fire.\n\n\"I begin to feel very pleasant,\" said Nerle, \"for surely we shall not\nget away from these folks without a vast deal of trouble.  They do not\nseem to oppose our advance, but it is plain they will not allow us any\nchance of retreat.\"\n\n\"We do not wish to retreat,\" declared the prince.\n\nNerle cast another glance behind, and saw that the Gray Men had halted\nat the edge of the valley, while the giants were closing up as soon as\nthe horses passed them and now marched in close file in their rear.\n\n\"It strikes me,\" he muttered, softly, \"that this is like to prove our\nlast adventure.\" But although Prince Marvel might have heard the words\nhe made no reply, being evidently engaged in deep thought.\n\nAs they drew nearer the castle it towered above them like a veritable\nmountain, so big and high was it; and the walls cast deep shadows far\naround, as if twilight had fallen.  They heard the loud blare of a\ntrumpet sounding far up on the battlements; the portals of the castle\nsuddenly opened wide, and they entered a vast courtyard paved with\nplates of gold.  Tiny dwarfs, so crooked that they resembled crabs,\nrushed forward and seized the bridles of the horses, while the\nstrangers slowly dismounted and looked around them.\n\nWhile the steeds were being led to the stables an old man, clothed in a\nflowing robe as white in color as his beard, bowed before Prince Marvel\nand said in a soft voice:\n\n\"Follow me!\"\n\nThe prince stretched his arms, yawned as if tired with his ride, and\nthen glared upon the old man with an expression of haughty surprise.\n\n\"I follow no one!\" said he, proudly.  \"I am Prince Marvel, sirrah, and\nif the owner of this castle wishes to see me I shall receive him here,\nas befits my rank and station.\"\n\nThe man looked surprised, but only bowed lower than before.\n\n\"It is the king's command,\" he answered.\n\n\"The king?\"\n\n\"Yes; you are in the castle of King Terribus, the lord and ruler of\nSpor.\"\n\n\"That is different,\" remarked the prince, lightly.  \"Still, I will\nfollow no man.  Point out the way and I will go to meet his Majesty.\"\n\nThe old man extended a lean and trembling finger toward an archway.\nPrince Marvel strode forward, followed by Nerle, and passing under the\narch he threw open a door at the far end and boldly entered the\nthrone-room of King Terribus.\n\n\n\n8.  The Fool-Killer\n\nThe room was round, with a dome at the top.  The bare walls were of\ngray stone, with square, open windows set full twenty feet from the\nfloor.  Rough gray stone also composed the floor, and in the center of\nthe room stood one great rock with a seat hollowed in its middle.  This\nwas the throne, and round about it stood a swarm of men and women\ndressed in rich satins, velvets and brocades, brilliantly ornamented\nwith gold and precious stones.  The men were of many shapes and\nsizes--giants and dwarfs being among them.  The women all seemed young\nand beautiful.\n\nPrince Marvel cast but a passing glance at this assemblage, for his eye\nquickly sought the rude throne on which was seated King Terribus.\n\nThe personal appearance of this monster was doubtless the most hideous\nknown in that age of the world.  His head was large and shaped like an\negg; it was bright scarlet in color and no hair whatever grew upon it.\nIt had three eyes--one in the center of his face, one on the top of his\nhead and one in the back.  Thus he was always able to see in every\ndirection at the same time.  His nose was shaped like an elephant's\ntrunk, and swayed constantly from side to side.  His mouth was very\nwide and had no lips at all, two rows of sharp and white teeth being\nalways plainly visible beneath the swaying nose.\n\nKing Terribus, although surrounded by so splendid a court, wore a\nsimple robe of gray cloth, with no ornament or other finery, and his\nstrange and fearful appearance was strongly contrasted with the\nglittering raiment of his courtiers and the beauty of his ladies in\nwaiting.\n\nWhen Prince Marvel, with Nerle marching close behind, entered the great\nroom, Terribus looked at him sharply a moment, and then bowed.  And\nwhen he bowed the eye upon the top of his head also looked sharply at\nthe intruders.\n\nThen the king spoke, his voice sounding so sweet and agreeable that it\nalmost shocked Nerle, who had expected to hear a roar like that from a\nwild beast.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" asked Terribus.\n\n\"Partly by chance and partly from curiosity,\" answered Prince Marvel.\n\"No one in this island, except your own people, had ever seen the king\nof Spor; so, finding myself in your country, I decided to come here and\nhave a look at you.\"\n\nThe faces of the people who stood about the throne wore frightened\nlooks at the unheard of boldness of this speech to their terrible\nmonarch.  But the king merely nodded and inquired:\n\n\"Since you have seen me, what do you think of me?\"\n\n\"I am sorry you asked that question,\" returned the prince; \"for I must\nconfess you are a very frightful-looking creature, and not at all\nagreeable to gaze upon.\"\n\n\"Ha! you are honest, as well as frank,\" exclaimed the king.  \"But that\nis the reason I do not leave my kingdom, as you will readily\nunderstand.  And that is the reason I never permit strangers to come\nhere, under penalty of death.  So long as no one knows the King of Spor\nis a monster people will not gossip about my looks, and I am very\nsensitive regarding my personal appearance.  You will perhaps\nunderstand that if I could have chosen I should have been born\nbeautiful instead of ugly.\"\n\n\"I certainly understand that.  And permit me to say I wish you were\nbeautiful.  I shall probably dream of you for many nights,\" added the\nprince.\n\n\"Not for many,\" said King Terribus, quietly.  \"By coming here you have\nchosen death, and the dead do not dream.\"\n\n\"Why should I die?\" inquired Prince Marvel, curiously.\n\n\"Because you have seen me.  Should I allow you to go away you would\ntell the world about my ugly face.  I do not like to kill you, believe\nme; but you must pay the penalty of your rashness--you and the man\nbehind you.\"\n\nNerle smiled at this; but whether from pride at being called a man or\nin pleasurable anticipation of the sufferings to come I leave you to\nguess.\n\n\"Will you allow me to object to being killed?\" asked the prince.\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the king, courteously.  \"I expect you to object.\nIt is natural.  But it will do you no good.\"\n\nThen Terribus turned to an attendant and commanded:\n\n\"Send hither the Fool-Killer.\"\n\nAt this Prince Marvel laughed outright.\n\n\"The Fool-Killer!\" he cried; \"surely your Majesty does me little\ncredit.  Am I, then, a fool?\"\n\n\"You entered my kingdom uninvited,\" retorted the king, \"and you tell me\nto my face I am ugly.  Moreover, you laugh when I condemn you to death.\nFrom this I conclude the Fool-Killer is the proper one to execute you.\nBehold!\"\n\nMarvel turned quickly, to find a tall, stalwart man standing behind\nhim.  His features were strong but very grave, and the prince caught a\nlook of compassion in his eye as their gaze met.  His skin was fair and\nwithout blemish, a robe of silver cloth fell from his shoulders, and in\nhis right hand he bore a gleaming sword.\n\n\"Well met!\" cried Marvel, heartily, as he bowed to the Fool-Killer.  \"I\nhave often heard your name mentioned, but 'tis said in the world that\nyou are a laggard in your duty.\"\n\n\"Had I my way,\" answered the Fool-Killer, \"my blade would always drip.\nIt is my master, yonder, who thwarts my duty.\"  And he nodded toward\nKing Terribus.\n\n\"Then you should exercise your right on him, and cleave the ugly head\nfrom his shoulders,\" declared the prince.\n\n\"Nay, unless I interfered with the Fool-Killer,\" said the king, \"I\nshould soon have no subjects left to rule; for at one time or another\nthey all deserve the blade.\"\n\n\"Why, that may be true enough,\" replied Prince Marvel.  \"But I think,\nunder such circumstances, your Fool-Killer is a needless servant.  So I\nwill rid you of him in a few moments.\"\n\nWith that he whipped out his sword and stood calmly confronting the\nFool-Killer, whose grave face never changed in expression as he\nadvanced menacingly upon his intended victim.  The blades clashed\ntogether, and that of the Fool-Killer broke short off at the hilt.  He\ntook a step backward, stumbled and fell prone upon the rocky floor,\nwhile Prince Marvel sprang forward and pressed the point of his sword\nagainst his opponent's breast.\n\n\"Hold!\" cried the king, starting to his feet.  \"Would you slay my\nFool-Killer?  Think of the harm you would do the world!\"\n\n\"But he is laggard and unfaithful to his calling!\" answered the prince,\nsternly.\n\n\"Nevertheless, if he remove but one fool a year he is a benefit to\nmankind,\" declared the king.  \"Release him, I pray you!\"\n\nThen the victor withdrew his sword and stood aside, while the\nFool-Killer slowly got upon his feet and bowed humbly before the king.\n\n\"Go!\" shouted Terribus, his eye flashing angrily.  \"You have humiliated\nme before my enemy.  As an atonement see that you kill me a fool a day\nfor sixty days.\"\n\nHearing this command, many of the people about the throne began to\ntremble; but the king paid no attention to their fears, and the\nFool-Killer bowed again before his master and withdrew from the chamber.\n\n\n\n9.  The Royal Dragon of Spor\n\n\"Now,\" said Terribus, regarding the prince gloomily, \"I must dispose of\nyou in another way.\"\n\nFor a moment he dropped his scarlet head in thought.  Then he turned\nfiercely upon his attendants.\n\n\"Let the Wrestler come forward!\" he shouted, as loudly as his mild\nvoice would carry.\n\nInstantly a tall blackamoor advanced from the throng and cast off his\nflowing robe, showing a strong figure clad only in a silver loincloth.\n\n\"Crack me this fellow's bones!\" commanded Terribus.\n\n\"I beg your Majesty will not compel me to touch him,\" said Prince\nMarvel, with a slight shudder; \"for his skin is greasy, and will soil\nmy hands.  Here, Nerle!\" he continued, turning to his esquire, \"dispose\nof this black man, and save me the trouble.\"\n\nNerle laughed pleasantly.  The black was a powerfully built man, and\ncompared with Nerle and the prince, who had but the stature of boys, he\ntowered like a very giant in size.  Nevertheless, Nerle did not\nhesitate to spring upon the Wrestler, who with a quick movement sent\nthe boy crashing against the stone pavement.\n\nNerle was much bruised by the fall, and as he painfully raised himself\nto his feet a great lump was swelling behind his left ear, where his\nhead had struck the floor, and he was so dizzy that the room seemed\nswimming around him in a circle.  But he gave a happy little laugh, and\nsaid to the prince, gratefully:\n\n\"Thank you very much, my master!  The fall is hurting me delightfully.\nI almost feel as if I could cry, and that would be joy indeed!\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered the prince, with a sigh, \"I see I must get my hands\ngreased after all\"--for the black's body had really been greased to\nenable him to elude the grasp of his opponents.\n\nBut Marvel made a quick leap and seized the Wrestler firmly around the\nwaist.  The next moment, to the astonishment of all, the black man flew\nswiftly into the air, plunged through one of the open windows high up\nin the wall, and disappeared from view.  When the king and his people\nagain turned their wondering eyes upon the prince he was wiping his\nhands carefully upon a silk handkerchief.\n\nAt this sight a pretty young girl, who stood near the throne, laughed\naloud, and the sound of her laughter made King Terribus very angry.\n\n\"Come here!\" he commanded, sternly.  The girl stepped forward, her face\nnow pale and frightened, while tear-drops trembled upon the lashes that\nfringed her downcast eyes.  \"You have dared to laugh at the humiliation\nof your king,\" said Terribus, his horrid face more crimson than ever,\n\"and as atonement I command that you drink of the poisoned cup.\"\n\nInstantly a dwarf came near, bearing a beautiful golden goblet in his\ncrooked hands.\n\n\"Drink!\" he said, an evil leer upon his face.\n\nThe girl well knew this goblet contained a vile poison, one drop of\nwhich on her tongue would cause death; so she hesitated, trembling and\nshrinking from the ordeal.\n\nPrince Marvel looked into her sweet face with pitying eyes, and\nstepping quickly to her side, took her hand in his.\n\n\"Now drink!\" he said, smiling upon her; \"the poison will not hurt you.\"\n\nShe drank obediently, while the dwarf chuckled with awful glee and the\nking looked on eagerly, expecting her to fall dead at his feet.  But\ninstead the girl stood upright and pressed Marvel's hand, looking\ngratefully into his face.\n\n\"You are a fairy!\" she whispered, so low that no one else heard her\nvoice.  \"I knew that you would save me.\"\n\n\"Keep my secret,\" whispered the prince in return, and still holding her\nhand he led her back to her former place.\n\nKing Terribus was almost wild with rage and disappointment, and his\nelephant nose twisted and squirmed horribly.\n\n\"So you dare to thwart my commands, do you!\" he cried, excitedly.\n\"Well, we shall soon see which of us is the more powerful.  I have\ndecreed your death--and die you shall!\"\n\nFor a moment his eye roved around the chamber uncertainly.  Then he\nshouted, suddenly:\n\n\"Ho, there!  Keepers of the royal menagerie--appear!\"\n\nThree men entered the room and bowed before the king.  They were of the\nGray Men of the mountains, who had followed Prince Marvel and Nerle\nthrough the rocky passes.\n\n\"Bring hither the Royal Dragon,\" cried the king, \"and let him consume\nthese strangers before my very eyes!\"\n\nThe men withdrew, and presently was heard a distant shouting, followed\nby a low rumbling sound, with groans, snorts, roars and a hissing like\nsteam from the spout of a teakettle.\n\nThe noise and shouting drew nearer, while the people huddled together\nlike frightened sheep; and then suddenly the doors flew open and the\nRoyal Dragon advanced to the center of the room.\n\nThis creature was at once the pride and terror of the Kingdom of Spor.\nIt was more than thirty feet in length and covered everywhere with\nlarge green scales set with diamonds, making the dragon, when it moved,\na very glittering spectacle.  Its eyes were as big as pie-plates, and\nits mouth--when wide opened--fully as large as a bath-tub.  Its tail\nwas very long and ended in a golden ball, such as you see on the top of\nflagstaffs.  Its legs, which were as thick as those of an elephant, had\nscales which were set with rubies and emeralds.  It had two monstrous,\nbig ears and two horns of carved ivory, and its teeth were also carved\ninto various fantastic shapes--such as castles, horses' heads, chinamen\nand griffins--so that if any of them broke it would make an excellent\numbrella handle.\n\nThe Royal Dragon of Spor came crawling into the throne-room rather\nclumsily, groaning and moaning with every step and waving its ears like\ntwo blankets flying from a clothesline.\n\nThe king looked on it and frowned.\n\n\"Why are you not breathing fire and brimstone?\" he demanded, angrily.\n\n\"Why, I was caught out in a gale the other night,\" returned the Dragon,\nrubbing the back of its ear with its left front paw, as it paused and\nlooked at the king, \"and the wind put out my fire.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you light it again?\" asked Terribus, turning on the\nkeepers.\n\n\"We--we were out of matches, your Majesty!\" stammered the trembling\nGray Men.\n\n\"So--ho!\" yelled the king, and was about to order the keepers beheaded;\nbut just then Nerle pulled out his match-box, lit one of the matches,\nand held it in front of the Dragon's mouth.  Instantly the creature's\nbreath caught fire; and it began to breathe flames a yard in length.\n\n\"That's better,\" sighed the Dragon, contentedly.  \"I hope your Majesty\nis now satisfied.\"\n\n\"No,--I am not satisfied!\" declared King Terribus.  \"Why do you not\nlash your tail?\"\n\n\"Ah, I can't do that!\" replied the Dragon.  \"It's all stiffened up with\nrheumatism from the dampness of my cave.  It hurts too much to lash it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, gnash your teeth!\" commanded the king.\n\n\"Tut--tut!\" answered the Dragon, mildly; \"I can't do that, either; for\nsince you had them so beautifully carved it makes my teeth ache to\ngnash them.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what are you good for?\" cried the king, in a fury.\n\n\"Don't I look awful?  Am I not terrible to gaze on?\" inquired the\nDragon, proudly, as it breathed out red and yellow flames and made them\ncurl in circles around its horns.  \"I guess there's no need for me to\nsuggest terror to any one that happens to see me,\" it added, winking\none of the pie-plate eyes at King Terribus.\n\nThe king looked at the monster critically, and it really seemed to him\nthat it was a frightful thing to behold.  So he curbed his anger and\nsaid, in his ordinary sweet voice:\n\n\"I have called you here to destroy these two strangers.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked the Dragon, looking upon Prince Marvel and Nerle with\ninterest.\n\n\"I am not particular,\" answered the king.  \"You may consume them with\nyour fiery breath, or smash them with your tail, or grind them to atoms\nbetween your teeth, or tear them to pieces with your claws.  Only, do\nhurry up and get it over with!\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m!\" said the Dragon, thoughtfully, as if it didn't relish the\njob; \"this one isn't Saint George, is it?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed the king, irritably; \"it's Prince Marvel.  Do get\nto work as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Prince Marvel--Prince Marvel,\" repeated the Dragon.  \"Why, there isn't\na prince in the whole world named Marvel!  I'm pretty well posted on\nthe history of royal families, you know.  I'm afraid he's Saint George\nin disguise.\"\n\n\"Isn't your name Prince Marvel?\" inquired the king, turning to the\nboyish-looking stranger.\n\n\"It is,\" answered Marvel.\n\n\"Well, it's mighty strange I've never heard of you,\" persisted the\nDragon.  \"But tell me, please, how would you prefer to be killed?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not going to be killed at all,\" replied the prince, laughing.\n\n\"Do you hear that, Terribus?\" asked the Dragon, turning to the king;\n\"he says he isn't going to be killed.\"\n\n\"But I say he is!\" cried Terribus.  \"I have decreed his death.\"\n\n\"But do you suppose I'm going to kill a man against his will?\" inquired\nthe Dragon, in a reproachful voice; \"and such a small man, too!  Do you\ntake me for a common assassin--or a murderer?\"\n\n\"Do you intend to obey my orders?\" roared the king.\n\n\"No, I don't; and that's flat!\" returned the Dragon, sharply.  \"It's\ntime for me to take my cough medicine; so if you've nothing more to say\nI'll go back to my cave.\"\n\n\"Go, go, go!\" shrieked the king, stamping his foot in passion.  \"You've\noutlived your usefulness!  You're a coward!  You're a traitor!  You're\na--a--a--\"\n\n\"I'm a dragon and a gentleman!\" answered the monster, proudly, as the\nking paused for lack of a word; \"and I believe I know what's proper for\ndragons to do and what isn't.  I've learned wisdom from my father, who\ngot into trouble with Saint George, and if I fought with this person\nwho calls himself Prince Marvel, I'd deserve to be a victim of your\nFool-Killer.  Oh, I know my business, King Terribus; and if you knew\nyours, you'd get rid of this pretended prince as soon as possible!\"\n\nWith this speech he winked at Prince Marvel, turned soberly around and\ncrawled from the room.  One of the keepers got too near and the\nDragon's breath set fire to his robe, the flames being with difficulty\nextinguished; and the gold ball on the end of the Dragon's tail struck\na giant upon his shins and made him dance and howl in pain.\n\nBut, aside from these slight accidents, the monster managed to leave\nthe throne-room without undue confusion, and every one, including the\nking, seemed glad to be rid of him.\n\n\n\n10.  Prince Marvel Wins His Fight\n\nWhen the door had closed on the Royal Dragon, King Terribus turned\nagain to Prince Marvel, while his crimson face glowed with\nembarrassment, and his front eye rolled with baffled rage as he thought\nhow vain had been all his efforts to kill this impudent invader of his\ndomains.\n\nBut his powers were by no means exhausted.  He was a mighty king--the\nmightiest of all in the Enchanted Island, he believed--and ways to\ndestroy his enemies were numerous.\n\n\"Send for a hundred of my Gray Men!\" he suddenly cried; and a courtier\nran at once to summon them.  The Gray Men would obey his orders without\nquestion, he well knew.  They were silent, stubborn, quick, and\nfaithful to their king.  Terribus had but to command and his will would\nbe obeyed.\n\nThey entered the room so quietly that Nerle never knew they were there\nuntil he turned and found the hundred gray ones standing close together\nin the center of the hall.  Then Prince Marvel came to Nerle's side and\nwhispered something in his ear.\n\n\"Will you obey my orders?\" they heard the king ask.  And the Gray Men,\nwith their eyes fixed upon their master, nodded all their hundred heads\nand put their hands upon the dangerous three-tined forks that were\nstuck in every one of the hundred belts.\n\nPrince Marvel handed one end of a coiled rope to Nerle, and then they\nboth sprang forward and ran around the spot where the hundred Gray Men\nstood huddled together.  Then they were pulled closer together than\nbefore--closer, and still closer--for the prince and Nerle had\nsurrounded them with the rope and were tying the two ends together in a\ntight knot.  The rope cut into the waists of those on the outside, and\nthey pressed inward against their fellows until there was scarcely\nspace to stick a knife-blade between any two of them.  When the prince\nhad tied the rope firmly King Terribus, who had been looking on amazed,\nsaw that his hundred Gray Men were fastened together like a bundle of\nkindling-wood, and were unable to stir hand or foot.\n\nAnd, while he still gazed open-mouthed at the strange sight, Prince\nMarvel tilted the bundle of men up on its edge and rolled it out of the\ndoor.  It went rolling swiftly through the courtyard and bounded down\nthe castle steps, where the rope broke and the men fell sprawling in\nall directions on the marble walk.\n\nKing Terribus sighed, for such treatment of his Gray Men, whom he\ndearly loved, made him very unhappy.\n\nBut more than ever was he resolved to kill these impudent strangers,\nwho, in the very heart of his kingdom where thousands bowed to his\nwill, dared openly defy his power.  So, after a moment's thought,\nTerribus beckoned to a dwarf who, robed in gay and glittering apparel,\nstood near his throne.\n\n\"Summon the royal Dart Slingers!\" he said, with a scowl.\n\nThe little man bowed and hastened away, to return presently with twenty\ncuriously crooked dwarfs, each armed with a sling and a quiver full of\nslender, sharp-pointed darts.\n\n\"Slay me these strangers!\" exclaimed the king, in his gruffest voice.\n\nNow Nerle, when he beheld these terrible Dart Slingers, of whom he had\nheard many tales in his boyhood, began to shiver and shake with fright,\nso that his teeth rattled one upon another.  And he reflected: \"Soon\nshall I be content, for these darts will doubtless pierce every part of\nmy body.\"\n\nThe dwarfs formed a line at one side of the gloomy throne-room, and\nPrince Marvel, who had been earnestly regarding them, caught Nerle by\nthe arm and led him to the opposite wall.\n\n\"Stand close behind me and you will be safe,\" he whispered to his\nesquire.\n\nThen each dwarf fixed a dart in his sling, and at a word from their\nchief they all drew back their arms and launched a shower of the sharp\nmissiles at the strangers.\n\nSwift and true they sped, each dart intended to pierce the body of the\nyouthful knight who stood so calm before them.  Prince Marvel had\nraised his right arm, and in his hand was a small leather sack, with a\nwide mouth.  As the darts flew near him a strange thing happened: they\neach and all swerved from their true course and fell rattling into the\nleathern sack, to the wonder of the royal slingers and the dismay of\nKing Terribus himself.\n\n\"Again!\" screamed the king, his usually mild voice hoarse with anger.\n\nSo again the dwarfs cast their darts, and again the leathern sack\ncaught them every one.  Another flight followed, and yet another, till\nthe magic sack was packed full of the darts and not a dwarf had one\nremaining in his quiver.\n\nAmid the awed silence of the beholders of this feat the merry laughter\nof Prince Marvel rang loud and clear; for the sight of the puzzled and\nterrified faces about him was very comical.  Plucking a dart from the\nsack he raised his arm and cried:\n\n\"Now it is my turn.  You shall have back your darts!\"\n\n\"Hold!\" shouted the king, in great fear.  \"Do not, I beg you, slay my\nfaithful servants.\"  And with a wave of his hand he dismissed the\ndwarfs, who were glad to rush from the room and escape.\n\nNerle wiped the tears from his eyes, for he was sorely disappointed at\nhaving again escaped all pain and discomfort; but Prince Marvel seated\nhimself quietly upon a stool and looked at the scowling face of King\nTerribus with real amusement.\n\nThe monarch of Spor had never before been so foiled and scorned by any\nliving creature.  Defeated and humbled before his own people, he bowed\nhis crimson head on his hands and sullenly regarded his foe with his\ntop eye.  Then it was that the idea came to him that no ordinary mortal\ncould have thwarted him so easily, and he began to fear he was\ndealing--perhaps unawares--with some great magician or sorcerer.  That\na fairy should have assumed a mortal form he never once considered, for\nsuch a thing was until then unheard of in the Enchanted Island of Yew.\nBut with the knowledge that he had met his master, whoever he might\nprove to be, and that further attempts upon the stranger's life might\nlead to his own undoing, King Terribus decided to adopt a new line of\nconduct, hoping to accomplish by stratagem what he could not do by\nforce.  To be sure, there remained his regiment of Giants, the pride of\nhis kingdom; but Terribus dreaded to meet with another defeat; and he\nwas not at all sure, after what had happened, that the giants would\nsucceed in conquering or destroying the strangers.\n\n\"After all,\" he thought, \"my only object in killing them was to prevent\ntheir carrying news of my monstrous appearance to the outside world; so\nif I can but manage to keep them forever in my kingdom it will answer\nmy purpose equally well.\"\n\nAs the result of this thought he presently raised his head and spoke to\nPrince Marvel in a quiet and even cheerful voice.\n\n\"Enough of these rude and boisterous games,\" said he, with a smile that\nshowed his white teeth in a repulsive manner.  \"They may have seemed to\nmy people an ill welcome to my good friend, Prince Marvel; yet they\nwere only designed to show the powers of the mighty magician who has\nbecome my guest.  Nay, do not deny it, Prince; from the first I guessed\nyour secret, and to prove myself right I called my servants to oppose\nyou, being sure they could not do you an injury.  But no more of such\nfooling,--and pray forgive my merry game at your expense.  Henceforth\nwe shall be friends, and you are heartily welcome to the best my\nkingdom affords.\"\n\nWith this speech Terribus stepped down from his throne and approached\nPrince Marvel with outstretched hand.  The prince was not at all\ndeceived, but he was pleased to see how cunningly the king excused his\nattempts to kill him.  So he laughed and touched the hand Terribus\nextended, for this fairy prince seemed to have no anger against any\nmortal who ventured to oppose him.\n\nThe strangers were now conducted, with every mark of respect, to a\nbeautiful suite of apartments in the castle, wherein were soft beds\nwith velvet spreads, marble baths with perfumed waters, and a variety\nof silken and brocaded costumes from which they might select a change\nof raiment.\n\nNo sooner had they bathed and adorned themselves fittingly than they\nwere summoned to the king's banquet hall, being escorted thither by\ntwelve young maidens bearing torches with lavender-colored flames.\n\nThe night had fallen upon the mountains outside, but the great banquet\nhall was brilliant with the glow of a thousand candles, and seated at\nthe head of the long table was King Terribus.\n\nYet here, as in the throne-room, the ruler of Spor was dressed in\nsimplest garments, and his seat was a rough block of stone.  All about\nhim were lords and ladies in gorgeous array; the walls were hung with\nrare embroideries; the table was weighted with gold platters and richly\ncarved goblets filled with sweet nectars.  But the king himself, with\nhis horrid, ugly head, was like a great blot on a fair parchment, and\neven Prince Marvel could not repress a shudder as he gazed upon him.\n\nTerribus placed his guest upon his right hand and loaded him with\nhonors.  Nerle stood behind the prince's chair and served him\nfaithfully, as an esquire should.  But the other servants treated Nerle\nwith much deference, noting in him an air of breeding that marked him\nthe unusual servant of an unusual master.\n\nIndeed, most curious were the looks cast on these marvelous men who had\ncalmly walked into the castle of mighty Terribus and successfully\ndefied his anger; for in spite of his youthful appearance and smiling\nface every attendant at the banquet feared Prince Marvel even more than\nthey feared their own fierce king.\n\n\n\n11.  The Cunning of King Terribus\n\nThe days that followed were pleasant ones for Prince Marvel and Nerle,\nwho were treated as honored guests by both the king and his courtiers.\nBut the prince seemed to be the favorite, for at all games of skill and\ntrials at arms he was invariably the victor, while in the evenings,\nwhen the grand ball-room was lighted up and the musicians played sweet\nmusic, none was so graceful in the dance as the fairy prince.\n\nNerle soon tired of the games and dancing, for he had been accustomed\nto them at his father's castle; and moreover he was shy in the society\nof ladies; so before many weeks had passed he began to mope and show a\ndiscontented face.\n\nOne day the prince noticed his esquire's dismal expression of\ncountenance, and asked the cause of it.\n\n\"Why,\" said Nerle, \"here I have left my home to seek worries and\ntroubles, and have found but the same humdrum life that existed at my\nfather's castle.  Here our days are made smooth and pleasant, and there\nis no excitement or grief, whatever.  You have become a carpet-knight,\nPrince Marvel, and think more of bright eyes than of daring deeds.  So,\nif you will release me from your service I will seek further\nadventures.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" returned the prince, \"we will go together; for I, too, am tired\nof this life of pleasure.\"\n\nSo next morning Marvel sought the presence of King Terribus and said:\n\n\"I have come to bid your Majesty adieu, for my esquire and I are about\nto leave your dominions.\"\n\nAt first the king laughed, and his long nose began to sway from side to\nside.  Then, seeing the prince was in earnest, his Majesty frowned and\ngrew disturbed.  Finally he said:\n\n\"I must implore you to remain my guests a short time longer.  No one\nhas ever before visited me in my mountain home, and I do not wish to\nlose the pleasure of your society so soon.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, we must go,\" answered the prince, briefly.\n\n\"Are you not contented?\" asked Terribus.  \"Ask whatever you may desire,\nand it shall be granted you.\"\n\n\"We desire adventures amid new scenes,\" said Marvel, \"and these you can\nnot give us except by permission to depart.\"\n\nSeeing his guest was obstinate the king ceased further argument and\nsaid:\n\n\"Very well; go if you wish.  But I shall hope to see you return to us\nthis evening.\"\n\nThe prince paid no heed to this peculiar speech, but left the hall and\nhurried to the courtyard of the castle, where Nerle was holding the\nhorses in readiness for their journey.\n\nStanding around were many rows and files of the Gray Men, and when they\nreached the marble roadway they found it lined with motionless forms of\nthe huge giants.  But no one interfered with them in any way, although\nboth Prince Marvel and Nerle knew that every eye followed them as they\nrode forward.\n\nCuriously enough, they had both forgotten from what direction they had\napproached the castle; for, whereas they had at that time noticed but\none marble roadway leading to the entrance, they now saw that there\nwere several of these, each one connecting with a path through the\nmountains.\n\n\"It really doesn't matter which way we go, so long as we get away from\nthe Kingdom of Spor,\" said Prince Marvel; so he selected a path by\nchance, and soon they were riding through a mountain pass.\n\nThe pleased, expectant look on Nerle's face had gradually turned to one\nof gloom.\n\n\"I hoped we should have a fight to get away,\" he said, sadly; \"and in\nthat case I might have suffered considerable injury and pain.  But no\none has injured us in any way, and perhaps King Terribus is really glad\nto be rid of us.\"\n\n\"With good reason, too, if such is the case,\" laughed Marvel; \"for,\nmark you, Nerle, the king has discovered we are more powerful than he\nis, and had he continued to oppose us, we might have destroyed his\nentire army.\"\n\nOn they rode through the rough hill paths, winding this way and that,\nuntil they lost all sense of the direction in which they were going.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said the prince; \"so long as we get farther and farther\naway from the ugly Terribus I shall be satisfied.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we are getting into more serious danger than ever,\" answered\nNerle, brightening; \"one of the giants told me the other day that near\nthe foot of these mountains is the Kingdom of the High Ki of Twi.\"\n\n\"Who is the High Ki of Twi?\" asked Prince Marvel.\n\n\"No one knows,\" answered Nerle.\n\n\"And what is the Kingdom of Twi like?\"\n\n\"No one knows that,\" answered Nerle.\n\n\"Then,\" returned the prince, with a smile, \"if by chance we visit the\nplace we shall know more than any one else.\"\n\nAt noon they ate luncheon by the wayside, Nerle having filled his pouch\nby stealth at the breakfast table.  There were great fragments of rock\nlying all about them, and the sun beat down so fiercely that the heat\nreflected from the rocks was hard to bear.  So the travelers did not\nlinger over their meal, but remounted and rode away as soon as\npossible.  When the sun began to get lower in the sky the rocks beside\nthe path threw the riders into shadow, so that their journey became\nmore pleasant.  They rode along, paying little attention to the way,\nbut talking and laughing merrily together, until it began to grow dark.\n\n\"Does this path never end?\" asked Prince Marvel, suddenly.  \"We ought\nto reach some place where men dwell before long, else we shall be\nobliged to spend the night among these rocks.\"\n\n\"And then perhaps the wolves will attack us,\" said Nerle, cheerfully,\n\"and tear us into pieces with their sharp teeth and claws.\"\n\nBut even as he spoke they rode around a turn in the path and saw a\nsight that made them pause in astonishment.  For just before them rose\nthe castle of King Terribus, and along both sides of the marble walk\nleading up to it were ranged the lines of giants, exactly as they had\nstood in the morning.\n\nNerle turned around in his saddle.  Sure enough, there were the Gray\nMen in the rear--stepping from behind every boulder and completely\nfilling the rocky pathway.\n\n\"Well, what shall we do?\" asked the esquire; \"fight?\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\" returned Prince Marvel, laughing at his friend's eager\nface.  \"It appears the path we chose winds around in a circle, and so\nhas brought us back to our starting-point.  So we must make the best of\na bad blunder and spend another night with our ugly friend King\nTerribus.\"\n\nThey rode forward through the rows of giants to the castle, where the\never-courteous servants took their horses and escorted them to their\nformer handsome apartments with every mark of respect.\n\nNo one seemed in the least surprised at their speedy return, and this\nfact at first puzzled Nerle, and then made him suspicious.\n\nAfter bathing and dusting their clothing they descended to the banquet\nhall, where King Terribus sat upon his gray stone throne and welcomed\nthem with quiet courtesy.\n\nThe sight of the king's crimson skin and deformed face sent a thrill of\nrepugnance through Prince Marvel, and under the impulse of a sudden\nthought he extended his hand toward Terribus and whispered a magic word\nwhich was unheard by any around him.\n\nNerle did not notice the prince's swift gesture nor the whispered word;\nbut he was staring straight at Terribus at the time, and he saw with\nsurprise the eye on the top of the king's head move down toward his\nforehead, and the eye in the center of his forehead slide slightly\ntoward the left, and the elephant-like nose shrink and shorten at the\nsame time.  Also it seemed to him that the king's skin was not so\ncrimson in color as before, and that a thin growth of hair had covered\nhis head.\n\nHowever, no one else appeared to notice any change--least of all\nTerribus--so Nerle seated himself at the table and began to eat.\n\n\"It was very kind of you to return so soon to my poor castle,\" said the\nking to Prince Marvel, in his sweet voice.\n\n\"We could not help it,\" laughed the prince, in reply; \"for the road\nwound right and left until we knew not which way we traveled; and then\nit finally circled around again to your castle.  But to-morrow we shall\nseek a new path and bid you farewell forever.\"\n\n\"Still,\" remarked the king, gravely, \"should you again miss your way, I\nshall be glad to welcome your return.\"\n\nThe prince bowed politely by way of reply, and turned to address the\nlittle maiden he had once saved from death by poison.  And so in\nfeasting, dancing and laughter the evening passed pleasantly enough to\nthe prince, and it was late when he called Nerle to attend him to their\napartment.\n\n\n\n12.  The Gift of Beauty\n\nThe following morning Marvel and Nerle once more set out to leave the\nKingdom of Spor and its ugly king.  They selected another pathway\nleading from the castle and traveled all day, coming at nightfall into\nview of the place whence they had started, with its solemn rows of\ngiants and Gray Men standing ready to receive them.\n\nThis repetition of their former experience somewhat annoyed the prince,\nwhile Nerle's usually despondent face wore a smile.\n\n\"I see trouble ahead,\" murmured the esquire, almost cheerfully.  \"Since\nthe king can not conquer us by force he intends to do it by sorcery.\"\n\nMarvel did not reply, but greeted the king quietly, while Terribus\nwelcomed their return as calmly as if he well knew they could not\nescape him.\n\nThat evening the prince made another pass toward the king with his hand\nand muttered again the magic word.  Nerle was watching, and saw the\nupper eye of Terribus glide still farther down his forehead and the\nother eye move again toward the left.  The swaying nose shrank to a few\ninches in length, and the skin that had once been so brilliantly\ncrimson turned to a dull red color.  This time the courtiers and ladies\nin waiting also noticed the change in the king's features, but were\nafraid to speak of it, as any reference to their monarch's personal\nappearance was by law punishable by death.  Terribus saw the startled\nlooks directed upon him, and raised his hand to feel of his nose and\neyes; but thinking that if any change in his appearance had taken\nplace, he must be uglier than before, he only frowned and turned away\nhis head.\n\nThe next day the king's guests made a third attempt to leave his\ndominions, but met with no better success than before, for a long and\ntedious ride only brought them back to their starting-place in the\nevening.\n\nThis time Prince Marvel was really angry, and striding into the king's\npresence he reproached him bitterly, saying:\n\n\"Why do you prevent us from leaving your kingdom?  We have not injured\nyou in any way.\"\n\n\"You have seen ME,\" returned Terribus, calmly, \"and I do not intend you\nshall go back to the world and tell people how ugly I am.\"\n\nThe prince looked at him, and could not repress a smile.  The two eyes\nof the king, having been twice removed from their first position, were\nnow both in his forehead, instead of below it, and one was much higher\nthan the other.  And the nose, although small when compared to what it\nhad been, still resembled an elephant's trunk.  Other changes had been\nmade for the better, but Terribus was still exceedingly repulsive to\nlook upon.\n\nSeeing the prince look at him and smile, the king flew into a fury of\nanger and declared that the strangers should never, while they lived,\nbe permitted to leave his castle again.  Prince Marvel became\nthoughtful at this, reflecting that the king's enmity all arose from\nhis sensitiveness about his ugly appearance, and this filled the\nyouthful knight with pity rather than resentment.\n\nWhen they had all assembled at the evening banquet the prince, for a\nthird time, made a mystic pass at the king and whispered a magic word.\nAnd behold! this time the charm was complete.  For the two front eyes\nof Terribus fell into their proper places, his nose became straight and\nwell formed, and his skin took on a natural, healthy color.  Moreover,\nhe now had a fine head of soft brown hair, with eyebrows and eyelashes\nto match, and his head was shapely and in proportion to his body.  As\nfor the eye that had formerly been in the back of his head, it had\ndisappeared completely.\n\nSo amazed were the subjects of the transformed king--who was now quite\nhandsome to look upon--that they began to murmur together excitedly,\nand something in the new sensations he experienced gave to the king's\nface likewise an expression of surprise.  Knowing from their pleased\nlooks that he must have improved in appearance, he found courage to\nraise his hand to his nose, and found it well formed.  Then he touched\nhis eyes, and realized they were looking straight out from his face,\nlike those of other people.\n\nFor some moments after making these discoveries the king remained\nmotionless, a smile of joy gradually spreading over his features.  Then\nhe said, aloud:\n\n\"What has happened?  Why do you all look so startled?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty is no longer ugly,\" replied Marvel, laughingly; \"so that\nwhen Nerle and I leave your kingdom we can proclaim nothing less than\npraise of your dignified and handsome appearance.\"\n\n\"Is my face indeed pleasing?\" demanded the king, eagerly.\n\n\"It is!\" cried the assembled courtiers and ladies, as with one voice.\n\n\"Bring me a mirror!\" said the king.  \"I shall look at my reflection for\nthe first time in many years.\"\n\nThe mirror being brought King Terribus regarded himself for a long time\nwith pleased astonishment; and then, his sensitive nature being\novercome by the shock of his good fortune, he burst into a flood of\ntears and rushed from the room.\n\nThe courtiers and ladies now bestowed many grateful thanks upon Prince\nMarvel for his kind deed; for they realized that thereafter their lives\nwould be safer from the king's anger and much pleasanter in every way.\n\n\"Terribus is not bad by nature,\" said one; \"but he brooded upon his\nugliness so much that the least thing served to throw him into a\nviolent passion, and our lives were never safe from one day to another.\"\n\nBy and by two giants entered the hall and carried away the throne of\ngray stone where Terribus had been accustomed to sit; and other slaves\nbrought a gorgeous throne of gold, studded with precious jewels, which\nthey put in its place.  And after a time the king himself returned to\nthe room, his simple gray gown replaced by flowing robes of purple,\nwith rich embroideries, such as he had not worn for many years.\n\n\"My people,\" said he, addressing those present with kindness and\ndignity, \"it seems to me fitting that a handsome king should be\nhandsomely attired, and an ugly one clothed simply.  For years I have\nbeen so terrible in feature that I dared not even look at my own image\nin a mirror.  But now, thanks to the gracious magic of my guest, I have\nbecome like other men, and hereafter you will find my rule as kind as\nit was formerly cruel.  To-night, in honor of this joyous occasion, we\nshall feast and make merry, and it is my royal command that you all do\nhonor and reverence to the illustrious Prince Marvel!\"\n\nA loud shout of approval greeted this speech, and the evening was merry\nindeed.  Terribus joined freely in the revelry, laughing as gaily as\nthe lightest-hearted damsel present.\n\nIt was nearly morning before they all retired, and as they sought their\nbeds Nerle asked the prince in a voice that sounded like an ill-natured\ngrowl:\n\n\"Why did you give the king beauty, after his treatment of us?\"\n\nMarvel looked at the reproachful face of his esquire and smiled.  \"When\nyou are older,\" said he, \"you will find that often there are many ways\nto accomplish a single purpose.  The king's ugliness was the bar to our\nleaving his country, for he feared our gossip.  So the easiest way for\nus to compass our escape was to take away his reason for detaining us.\nThus I conquered the king in my own way, and at the same time gained\nhis gratitude and friendship.\"\n\n\"Will he allow us to depart in the morning?\" inquired Nerle.\n\n\"I think so,\" said Marvel.\n\nIt was late when they rose from their slumbers; but, having\nbreakfasted, the prince's first act was to seek the king.\n\n\"We wish to leave your kingdom,\" said he.  \"Will you let us go?\"\n\nTerribus grasped the hand of his guest and pressed it with fervor,\nwhile tears of gratitude stood in his eyes.\n\n\"I should prefer that you remain with me always, and be my friend,\" he\nanswered.  \"But if you choose to leave me I shall not interfere in any\nway with your wishes.\"\n\nPrince Marvel looked at him thoughtfully, and then said: \"My time on\nthis island is short.  In a few months Prince Marvel will have passed\nout of the knowledge of men, and his name will be forgotten.  Before\nthen I hope to visit the Kingdoms of Dawna and Auriel and Plenta; so I\nmust not delay, but beg you will permit me to depart at once.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered Terribus.  \"Come with me, and I shall show you\nthe way.\"\n\nHe led the prince and Nerle to a high wall of rock, and placing his\nhand upon its rough surface, touched a hidden spring.  Instantly an\nimmense block of stone began to swing backward, disclosing a passage\nlarge enough for a man on horseback to ride through.\n\n\"This is the one road that leads out of my kingdom,\" said Terribus.\n\"The others all begin and end at the castle.  So that unless you know\nthe secret of this passage you could never escape from Spor.\"\n\n\"But where does this road lead?\" asked Marvel.\n\n\"To the Kingdom of Auriel, which you desire to visit.  It is not a\nstraight road, for it winds around the Land of Twi, so it will carry\nyou a little out of your way.\"\n\n\"What is the Land of Twi?\" inquired the prince.\n\n\"A small country hidden from the view of all travelers,\" said Terribus.\n\"No one has ever yet found a way to enter the land of Twi; yet there is\na rumor that it is ruled by a mighty personage called the High Ki.\"\n\n\"And does the rumor state what the High Ki of Twi is like?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" returned the king, smiling, \"so it will do you no good to\nbe curious.  And now farewell, and may good luck attend you.  Yet bear\nin mind the fact that King Terribus of Spor owes you a mighty debt of\ngratitude; and if you ever need my services, you have but to call on\nme, and I shall gladly come to your assistance.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" said Marvel, \"but there is small chance of my needing\nhelp.  Farewell, and may your future life be pleasant and happy!\"\n\nWith this he sprang to the saddle of his prancing charger and, followed\nby Nerle, rode slowly through the stone arch.  The courtiers and ladies\nhad flocked from the palace to witness their departure, and the giants\nand dwarfs and Gray Men were drawn up in long lines to speed the king's\nguests.  So it was a brilliant sight that Marvel and Nerle looked back\non; but once they were clear of the arch, the great stone rolled back\ninto its place, shutting them out completely from the Kingdom of Spor,\nwith its turreted castle and transformed king.\n\n\n\n13.  The Hidden Kingdom of Twi\n\nKnowing that at last they were free to roam according to their desire,\nthe travelers rode gaily along the paths, taking but scant heed of\ntheir way.\n\n\"Our faces are set toward new adventures,\" remarked the prince.  \"Let\nus hope they will prove more pleasant than the last.\"\n\n\"To be sure!\" responded Nerle.  \"Let us hope, at any rate, that we\nshall suffer more privations and encounter more trouble than we did in\nthat mountainous Kingdom of Spor.\"  Then he added: \"For one reason, I\nregret you are my master.\"\n\n\"What is that reason?\" asked the prince, turning to smile upon his\nesquire.\n\n\"You have a way of overcoming all difficulties without any trouble\nwhatsoever, and that deprives me of any chance of coming to harm while\nin your company.\"\n\n\"Cheer up, my boy!\" cried Marvel.  \"Did I not say there are new\nadventures before us?  We may not come through them so easily as we\ncame through the others.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied Nerle; \"it is always best to hope.\" And then he\ninquired: \"Why do you stop here, in the middle of the path?\"\n\n\"Because the path has ended rather suddenly,\" answered Marvel.  \"Here\nis a thick hedge of prickly briers barring our way.\"\n\nNerle looked over his master's shoulder and saw that a great hedge,\nhigh and exceedingly thick, cut off all prospect of their advancing.\n\n\"This is pleasant,\" said he; \"but I might try to force our way through\nthe hedge.  The briers would probably prick me severely, and that would\nbe delightful.\"\n\n\"Try it!\" the prince returned, with twinkling eyes.\n\nNerle sprang from his horse to obey, but at the first contact with the\nbriers he uttered a howl of pain and held up his hands, which were\nbleeding in a dozen places from the wounds of the thorns.\n\n\"Ah, that will content you for a time, I trust,\" said Marvel.  \"Now\nfollow me, and we will ride along beside the hedge until we find an\nopening.  For either it will come to an end or there will prove to be a\nway through it to the other side.\"\n\nSo they rode alongside the hedge for hour after hour; yet it did not\nend, nor could they espy any way to get through the thickly matted\nbriers.  By and by night fell, and they tethered their horses to some\nshrubs, where there were a few scanty blades of grass for them to crop,\nand then laid themselves down upon the ground, with bare rocks for\npillows, where they managed to sleep soundly until morning.\n\nThey had brought a supply of food in their pouches, and on this they\nbreakfasted, afterward continuing their journey beside the hedge.\n\nAt noon Prince Marvel uttered an exclamation of surprise and stopped\nhis horse.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Nerle.\n\n\"I have found the handkerchief with which you wiped the blood from your\nhands yesterday morning, and then carelessly dropped,\" replied the\nprince.  \"This proves that we have made a complete circle around this\nhedge without finding a way to pass through it.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Nerle, \"we had better leave the hedge and go in\nanother direction.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" declared Marvel.  \"The hedge incloses some unknown country,\nand I am curious to find out what it is.\"\n\n\"But there is no opening,\" remonstrated Nerle.\n\n\"Then we must make one.  Wouldn't you like to enjoy a little more pain?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" answered Nerle, \"my hands are still smarting very\ncomfortably from the pricks of yesterday.\"\n\n\"Therefore I must make the attempt myself,\" said the prince, and\ndrawing his sword he whispered a queer word to it, and straightway\nbegan slashing at the hedge.\n\nThe brambles fell fast before his blade, and when he had cut a big heap\nof branches from the hedge Nerle dragged them to one side, and the\nprince began again.\n\nIt was marvelous how thick the hedge proved.  Only a magic sword could\nhave done this work and remained sharp, and only a fairy arm could have\nproved strong enough to hew through the tough wood.  But the magic\nsword and fairy arm were at work, and naught could resist them.\n\nAfter a time the last branches were severed and dragged from the path,\nand then the travelers rode their horses through the gap into the\nunknown country beyond.\n\nThey saw at first glance that it was a land of great beauty; but after\nthat one look both Prince Marvel and Nerle paused and rubbed their\neyes, to assure themselves that their vision was not blurred.\n\nBefore them were two trees, exactly alike.  And underneath the trees\ntwo cows were grazing--each a perfect likeness of the other.  At their\nleft were two cottages, with every door and window and chimney the\nexact counterpart of another.  Before these houses two little boys were\nplaying, evidently twins, for they not only looked alike and dressed\nalike, but every motion one made was also made by the other at the same\ntime and in precisely the same way.  When one laughed the other\nlaughed, and when one stubbed his toe and fell down, the other did\nlikewise, and then they both sat up and cried lustily at the same time.\n\nAt this two women--it was impossible to tell one from the other--rushed\nout of the two houses, caught up the two boys, shook and dusted them in\nprecisely the same way, and led them by their ears back into the houses.\n\nAgain the astonished travelers rubbed their eyes, and then Prince\nMarvel looked at Nerle and said:\n\n\"I thought at first that I saw everything double, but there seems to be\nonly one of YOU.\"\n\n\"And of you,\" answered the boy.  \"But see! there are two hills ahead of\nus, and two paths lead from the houses over the hills!  How strange it\nall is!\"\n\nJust then two birds flew by, close together and perfect mates; and the\ncows raised their heads and \"mooed\" at the same time; and two men--also\ntwins--came over the two hills along the two paths with two\ndinner-pails in their hands and entered the two houses.  They were met\nat the doors by the two women, who kissed them exactly at the same time\nand helped them off with their coats with the same motions, and closed\nthe two doors with two slams at the same instant.\n\nNerle laughed.  \"What sort of country have we got into?\" he asked.\n\n\"Let us find out,\" replied the prince, and riding up to one of the\nhouses he knocked on the door with the hilt of his sword.\n\nInstantly the doors of both houses flew open, and both men appeared in\nthe doorways.  Both started back in amazement at sight of the\nstrangers, and both women shrieked and both little boys began to cry.\nBoth mothers boxed the children's ears, and both men gasped out:\n\n\"Who--who are you?\"\n\nTheir voices were exactly alike, and their words were spoken in unison.\nPrince Marvel replied, courteously:\n\n\"We are two strangers who have strayed into your country.  But I do not\nunderstand why our appearance should so terrify you.\"\n\n\"Why--you are singular!  There is only half of each of you!\" exclaimed\nthe two men, together.\n\n\"Not so,\" said the prince, trying hard not to laugh in their faces.\n\"We may be single, while you appear to be double; but each of us is\nperfect, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"Perfect!  And only half of you!\" cried the men.  And again the two\nwomen, who were looking over their husbands' shoulders, screamed at\nsight of the strangers; and again the two boys, who were clinging to\ntheir mothers' dresses in the same positions, began to cry.\n\n\"We did not know such strange people existed!\" said the two men, both\nstaring at the strangers and then wiping the beads of perspiration from\ntheir two brows with two faded yellow handkerchiefs.\n\n\"Nor did we!\" retorted the prince.  \"I assure you we are as much\nsurprised as you are.\"\n\nNerle laughed again at this, and to hear only one of the strangers\nspeak and the other only laugh seemed to terrify the double people\nanew.  So Prince Marvel quickly asked:\n\n\"Please tell us what country this is?\"\n\n\"The Land of Twi,\" answered both men, together.\n\n\"Oh! the Land of Twi.  And why is the light here so dim?\" continued the\nprince.\n\n\"Dim?\" repeated the men, as if surprised; \"why, this is twilight, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Nerle.  \"I hadn't thought of that.  We are in the\nlong hidden Land of Twi, which all men have heard of, but no man has\nfound before.\"\n\n\"And who may you be?\" questioned the prince, looking from one man to\nthe other, curiously.\n\n\"We are Twis,\" they answered.\n\n\"Twice?\"\n\n\"Twis--inhabitants of Twi.\"\n\n\"It's the same thing,\" laughed Nerle.  \"You see everything twice in\nthis land.\"\n\n\"Are none of your people single?\" asked Prince Marvel.\n\n\"Single,\" returned the men, as if perplexed.  \"We don't understand.\"\n\n\"Are you all double?--or are some of you just one?\" said the prince,\nwho found it difficult to put his question plainly.\n\n\"What does 'one' mean?\" asked the men.  \"There is no such word as 'one'\nin our language.\"\n\n\"They have no need of such a word,\" declared Nerle.\n\n\"We are only poor laborers,\" explained the men.  \"But over the hills\nlie the cities of Twi, where the Ki and the Ki-Ki dwell, and also the\nHigh Ki.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Marvel, \"I've heard of your High Ki.  Who is he?\"\n\nThe men shook their heads, together and with the same motion.\n\n\"We have never seen the glorious High Ki,\" they answered.  \"The sight\nof their faces is forbidden.  None but the Ki and the Ki-Ki has seen\nthe Supreme Rulers and High Ki.\"\n\n\"I'm getting mixed,\" said Nerle.  \"All this about the Ki and the Ki-Ki\nand the High Ki makes me dizzy.  Let's go on to the city and explore\nit.\"\n\n\"That is a good suggestion,\" replied the prince.  \"Good by, my\nfriends,\" he added, addressing the men.\n\nThey both bowed, and although they still seemed somewhat frightened\nthey answered him civilly and in the same words, and closed their doors\nat the same time.\n\nSo Prince Marvel and Nerle rode up the double path to the hills, and\nthe two cows became frightened and ran away with the same swinging\nstep, keeping an exact space apart.  And when they were a safe distance\nthey both stopped, looked over their right shoulders, and \"mooed\" at\nthe same instant.\n\n\n\n14.  The Ki and the Ki-Ki\n\nFrom the tops of the hills the travelers caught their first glimpse of\nthe wonderful cities of Twi.  Two walls surrounded the cities, and in\nthe walls were two gates just alike.  Within the inclosures stood many\nhouses, but all were built in pairs, from the poorest huts to the most\nsplendid palaces.  Every street was double, the pavements running side\nby side.  There were two lamp-posts on every corner, and in the dim\ntwilight that existed these lamp-posts were quite necessary.  If there\nwere trees or bushes anywhere, they invariably grew in pairs, and if a\nbranch was broken on one it was sure to be broken on the other, and\ndead leaves fell from both trees at identically the same moment.\n\nMuch of this Marvel and Nerle learned after they had entered the\ncities, but the view from the hills showed plainly enough that the\n\"double\" plan existed everywhere and in every way in this strange land.\n\nThey followed the paths down to the gates of the walls, where two pairs\nof soldiers rushed out and seized their horses by the bridles.  These\nsoldiers all seemed to be twins, or at least mates, and each one of\neach pair was as like the other as are two peas growing in the same\npod.  If one had a red nose the other's was red in the same degree, and\nthe soldiers that held the bridles of Nerle's horse both had their left\neyes bruised and blackened, as from a blow of the same force.\n\nThese soldiers, as they looked upon Nerle and the prince, seemed fully\nas much astonished and certainly more frightened than their prisoners.\nThey were dressed in bright yellow uniforms with green buttons, and the\nsoldiers who had arrested the prince had both torn their left\ncoat-sleeves and had patches of the same shape upon the seats of their\ntrousers.\n\n\"How dare you stop us, fellows?\" asked the prince, sternly.\n\nThe soldiers holding his horse both turned and looked inquiringly at\nthe soldiers holding Nerle's horse; and these turned to look at a\ndouble captain who came out of two doors in the wall and walked up to\nthem.\n\n\"Such things were never before heard of!\" said the two captains, their\nstartled eyes fixed upon the prisoners.  \"We must take them to the Ki\nand the Ki-Ki.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Prince Marvel.\n\n\"Because,\" replied the officers, \"they are our rulers, under grace of\nthe High Ki, and all unusual happenings must be brought to their\nnotice.  It is our law, you know--the law of the Kingdom of Twi.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Marvel, quietly; \"take us where you will; but if any\nharm is intended us you will be made to regret it.\"\n\n\"The Ki and the Ki-Ki will decide,\" returned the captains gravely,\ntheir words sounding at the same instant.\n\nAnd then the two pairs of soldiers led the horses through the double\nstreets, the captains marching ahead with drawn swords, and crowds of\ntwin men and twin women coming from the double doors of the double\nhouses to gaze upon the strange sight of men and horses who were not\ndouble.\n\nPresently they came upon a twin palace with twin turrets rising high\ninto the air; and before the twin doors the prisoners dismounted.\nMarvel was escorted through one door and Nerle through another, and\nthen they saw each other going down a double hallway to a room with a\ndouble entrance.\n\nPassing through this they found themselves in a large hall with two\ndomes set side by side in the roof.  The domes were formed of stained\nglass, and the walls of the hall were ornamented by pictures in pairs,\neach pair showing identically the same scenes.  This, was, of course,\nreasonable enough in such a land, where two people would always look at\ntwo pictures at the same time and admire them in the same way with the\nsame thoughts.\n\nBeneath one of the domes stood a double throne, on which sat the Ki of\nTwi--a pair of gray-bearded and bald-headed men who were lean and lank\nand stoop-shouldered.  They had small eyes, black and flashing, long\nhooked noses, great pointed ears, and they were smoking two pipes from\nwhich the smoke curled in exactly the same circles and clouds.\n\nBeneath the other dome sat the Ki-Ki of Twi, also on double thrones,\nsimilar to those of the Ki.  The Ki-Ki were two young men, and had\ngolden hair combed over their brows and \"banged\" straight across; and\ntheir eyes were blue and mild in expression, and their cheeks pink and\nsoft.  The Ki-Ki were playing softly upon a pair of musical instruments\nthat resembled mandolins, and they were evidently trying to learn a new\npiece of music, for when one Ki-Ki struck a false note the other Ki-Ki\nstruck the same false note at the same time, and the same expression of\nannoyance came over the two faces at the same moment.\n\nWhen the prisoners entered, the pairs of captains and soldiers bowed\nlow to the two pairs of rulers, and the Ki exclaimed--both in the same\nvoice of surprise:\n\n\"Great Kika-koo! what have we here?\"\n\n\"Most wonderful prisoners, your Highnesses,\" answered the captains.\n\"We found them at your cities' gates and brought them to you at once.\nThey are, as your Highnesses will see, each singular, and but half of\nwhat he should be.\"\n\n\"'Tis so!\" cried the double Ki, in loud voices, and slapping their\nright thighs with their right palms at the same time.  \"Most\nremarkable!  Most remarkable!\"\n\n\"I don't see anything remarkable about it,\" returned Prince Marvel,\ncalmly.  \"It is you, who are not singular, but double, that seem\nstrange and outlandish.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--perhaps!\" said the two old men, thoughtfully.  \"It is what we\nare not accustomed to that seems to us remarkable.  Eh, Ki-Ki?\" they\nadded, turning to the other rulers.\n\nThe Ki-Ki, who had not spoken a word but continued to play softly,\nsimply nodded their blond heads carelessly; so the Ki looked again at\nthe prisoners and asked:\n\n\"How did you get here?\"\n\n\"We cut a hole through the prickly hedge,\" replied Prince Marvel.\n\n\"A hole through the hedge!  Great Kika-koo!\" cried the gray-bearded Ki;\n\"is there, then, anything or any place on the other side of the hedge?\"\n\n\"Why, of course!  The world is there,\" returned the prince, laughing.\n\nThe old men looked puzzled, and glanced sharply from their little black\neyes at their prisoners.\n\n\"We thought nothing existed outside the hedge of Twi,\" they answered,\nsimply.  \"But your presence here proves we were wrong.  Eh! Ki-Ki?\"\n\nThis last was again directed toward the pair of musicians, who\ncontinued to play and only nodded quietly, as before.\n\n\"Now that you are here,\" said the twin Ki, stroking their two gray\nbeards with their two left hands in a nervous way, \"it must be evident\nto you that you do not belong here.  Therefore you must go back through\nthe hedge again and stay on the other side.  Eh, Ki-Ki?\"\n\nThe Ki-Ki still continued playing, but now spoke the first words the\nprisoners had heard from them.\n\n\"They must die,\" said the Ki-Ki, in soft and agreeable voices.\n\n\"Die!\" echoed the twin Ki, \"die?  Great Kika-koo!  And why so?\"\n\n\"Because, if there is a world on the other side of the hedge, they\nwould tell on their return all about the Land of Twi, and others of\ntheir kind would come through the hedge from curiosity and annoy us.\nWe can not be annoyed.  We are busy.\"\n\nHaving delivered this speech both the Ki-Ki went on playing the new\ntune, as if the matter was settled.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" retorted the old Ki, angrily.  \"You are getting more and\nmore bloodthirsty every day, our sweet and gentle Ki-Ki!  But we are\nthe Ki--and we say the prisoners shall not die!\"\n\n\"We say they shall!\" answered the youthful Ki-Ki, nodding their two\nheads at the same time, with a positive motion.  \"You may be the Ki,\nbut we are the Ki-Ki, and your superior.\"\n\n\"Not in this case,\" declared the old men.  \"Where life and death are\nconcerned we have equal powers with you.\"\n\n\"And if we disagree?\" asked the players, gently.\n\n\"Great Kika-koo!  If we disagree the High Ki must judge between us!\"\nroared the twin Ki, excitedly.\n\n\"Quite so,\" answered the Ki-Ki.  \"The strangers shall die.\"\n\n\"They shall not die!\" stormed the old men, with fierce gestures toward\nthe others, while both pairs of black eyes flashed angrily.\n\n\"Then we disagree, and they must be taken to the High Ki,\" returned the\nblond musicians, beginning to play another tune.\n\nThe two Ki rose from their thrones, paced two steps to the right and\nthree steps to the left, and then sat down again.\n\n\"Very well!\" they said to the captains, who had listened unmoved to the\nquarrel of the rulers; \"keep these half-men safe prisoners until\nto-morrow morning, and then the Ki-Ki and we ourselves will conduct\nthem to the mighty High Ki.\"\n\nAt this command the twin captains bowed again to both pairs of rulers\nand led Prince Marvel and Nerle from the room.  Then they were escorted\nalong the streets to the twin houses of the captains, and here the\nofficers paused and scratched their left ears with uncertain gestures.\n\n\"There being only half of each of you,\" they said, \"we do not know how\nto lock each of you in double rooms.\"\n\n\"Oh, let us both occupy the same room,\" said Prince Marvel.  \"We prefer\nit.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered the captains; \"we must transgress our usual\ncustoms in any event, so you may as well be lodged as you wish.\"\n\nSo Nerle and the prince were thrust into a large and pleasant room of\none of the twin houses, the double doors were locked upon them by twin\nsoldiers, and they were left to their own thoughts.\n\n\n\n15.  The High Ki of Twi\n\n\"Tell me, Prince, are we awake or asleep?\" asked Nerle, as soon as they\nwere alone.\n\n\"There is no question of our being awake,\" replied the prince, with a\nlaugh.  \"But what a curious country it is--and what a funny people!\"\n\n\"We can't call them odd or singular,\" said the esquire, \"for everything\nis even in numbers and double in appearance.  It makes me giddy to look\nat them, and I keep feeling of myself to make sure there is still only\none of me.\"\n\n\"You are but half a boy!\" laughed the prince--\"at least so long as you\nremain in the Land of Twi.\"\n\n\"I'd like to get out of it in double-quick time,\" answered Nerle; \"and\nwe should even now be on the other side of the hedge were it not for\nthat wicked pair of Ki-Ki, who are determined to kill us.\"\n\n\"It is strange,\" said the prince, thoughtfully, \"that the\nfierce-looking old Ki should be our friends and the gentle Ki-Ki our\nenemies.  How little one can tell from appearances what sort of heart\nbeats in a person's body!\"\n\nBefore Nerle could answer the two doors opened and two pairs of\nsoldiers entered.  They drew two small tables before the prince and two\nbefore Nerle, and then other pairs of twin soldiers came and spread\ncloths on the tables and set twin platters of meat and bread and fruit\non each of the tables.  When the meal had been arranged the prisoners\nsaw that there was enough for four people instead of two; and the\nsoldiers realized this also, for they turned puzzled looks first on the\ntables and then on the prisoners.  Then they shook all their twin heads\ngravely and went away, locking the twin doors behind them.\n\n\"We have one advantage in being singular,\" said Nerle, cheerfully; \"and\nthat is we are not likely to starve to death.  For we can eat the\nportions of our missing twins as well as our own.\"\n\n\"I should think you would enjoy starving,\" remarked the prince.\n\n\"No; I believe I have more exquisite suffering in store for me, since I\nhave met that gentle pair of Ki-Ki,\" said Nerle.\n\nWhile they were eating the two captains came in and sat down in two\nchairs.  These captains seemed friendly fellows, and after watching the\nstrangers for a while they remarked:\n\n\"We are glad to see you able to eat so heartily; for to-morrow you will\nprobably die.\"\n\n\"That is by no means certain,\" replied Marvel, cutting a piece from one\nof the twin birds on a platter before him--to the extreme surprise of\nthe captains, who had always before seen both birds carved alike at the\nsame time.  \"Your gray-bearded old Ki say we shall not die.\"\n\n\"True,\" answered the captains.  \"But the Ki-Ki have declared you shall.\"\n\n\"Their powers seem to be equal,\" said Nerle, \"and we are to be taken\nbefore the High Ki for judgment.\"\n\n\"Therein lies your danger,\" returned the captains, speaking in the same\ntones and with the same accents on their words.  \"For it is well known\nthe Ki-Ki has more influence with the High Ki than the Ki has.\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried Nerle; \"you are making me dizzy again.  I can't keep\ntrack of all these Kis.\"\n\n\"What is the High Ki like?\" asked Prince Marvel, who was much\ninterested in the conversation of the captains.  But this question the\nofficers seemed unable to answer.  They shook their heads slowly and\nsaid:\n\n\"The High Ki are not visible to the people of Twi.  Only in cases of\nthe greatest importance are the High Ki ever bothered or even\napproached by the Ki and the Ki-Ki, who are supposed to rule the land\naccording to their own judgment.  But if they chance to disagree, then\nthe matter is carried before the High Ki, who live in a palace\nsurrounded by high walls, in which there are no gates.  Only these\nrulers have ever seen the other side of the walls, or know what the\nHigh Ki are like.\"\n\n\"That is strange,\" said the prince.  \"But we, ourselves, it seems, are\nto see the High Ki to-morrow, and whoever they may chance to be, we\nhope to remain alive after the interview.\"\n\n\"That is a vain hope,\" answered the captains, \"for it is well known\nthat the High Ki usually decide in favor of the Ki-Ki, and against the\nwishes of the old Ki.\"\n\n\"That is certainly encouraging,\" said Nerle.\n\nWhen the captains had gone and left them to themselves, the esquire\nconfided to his master his expectations in the following speech:\n\n\"This High Ki sounds something terrible and fierce in my ears, and as\nthey are doubtless a pair, they will be twice terrible and fierce.\nPerhaps his royal doublets will torture me most exquisitely before\nputting me to death, and then I shall feel that I have not lived in\nvain.\"\n\nThey slept in comfortable beds that night, although an empty twin bed\nstood beside each one they occupied.  And in the morning they were\nserved another excellent meal, after which the captains escorted them\nagain to the twin palaces of the Ki and the Ki-Ki.\n\nThere the two pairs of rulers met them and headed the long procession\nof soldiers toward the palace of the High Ki.  First came a band of\nmusic, in which many queer sorts of instruments were played in pairs by\ntwin musicians; and it was amusing to Nerle to see the twin drummers\nroll their twin drums exactly at the same time and the twin trumpets\npeal out twin notes.  After the band marched the double Ki-Ki and the\ndouble Ki, their four bodies side by side in a straight line.  The\nKi-Ki had left their musical instruments in the palace, and now wore\nyellow gloves with green stitching down the backs and swung gold-headed\ncanes jauntily as they walked.  The Ki stooped their aged shoulders and\nshuffled along with their hands in their pockets, and only once did\nthey speak, and that was to roar \"Great Kika-koo!\" when the Ki-Ki\njabbed their canes down on the Ki's toes.\n\nFollowing the Ki-Ki and the Ki came the prince and Nerle, escorted by\nthe twin captains, and then there were files of twin soldiers bringing\nup the rear.\n\nCrowds of twin people, with many twin children amongst them, turned out\nto watch the unusual display, and many pairs of twin dogs barked\ntogether in unison and snapped at the heels of the marching twin\nsoldiers.\n\nBy and by they reached the great wall surrounding the High Ki's palace,\nand, sure enough, there was never a gate in the wall by which any might\nenter.  But when the Ki and the Ki-Ki had blown a shrill signal upon\ntwo pairs of whistles, they all beheld two flights of silver steps\nbegin to descend from the top of the wall, and these came nearer and\nnearer the ground until at last they rested at the feet of the Ki.\nThen the old men began ascending the steps carefully and slowly, and\nthe captains motioned to the prisoners to follow.  So Prince Marvel\nfollowed one of the Ki up the steps and Nerle the other Ki, while the\ntwo Ki-Ki came behind them so they could not escape.\n\nSo to the top of the wall they climbed, where a pair of twin servants\nin yellow and green--which seemed to be the royal colors--welcomed them\nand drew up the pair of silver steps, afterward letting them down on\nthe other side of the wall, side by side.\n\nThey descended in the same order as they had mounted to the top of the\nwall, and now Prince Marvel and Nerle found themselves in a most\nbeautiful garden, filled with twin beds of twin flowers, with many\npairs of rare shrubs.  Also, there were several double statuettes on\npedestals, and double fountains sending exactly the same sprays of\nwater the same distance into the air.\n\nDouble walks ran in every direction through the garden, and in the\ncenter of the inclosure stood a magnificent twin palace, built of\nblocks of white marble exquisitely carved.\n\nThe Ki and the Ki-Ki at once led their prisoners toward the palace and\nentered at its large arched double doors, where several pairs of\nservants met them.  These servants, they found, were all dumb, so that\nshould they escape from the palace walls they could tell no tales of\nthe High Ki.\n\nThe prisoners now proceeded through several pairs of halls, winding\nthis way and that, and at last came to a pair of golden double doors\nleading into the throne-room of the mighty High Ki.  Here they all\npaused, and the Ki-Ki both turned to the prince and Nerle and said:\n\n\"You are the only persons, excepting ourselves and the palace servants,\nwho have ever been permitted to see the High Ki of Twi.  As you are\nabout to die, that does not matter; but should you by any chance be\npermitted to live, you must never breathe a word of what you are about\nto see, under penalty of a sure and horrible death.\"\n\nThe prisoners made no reply to this speech, and, after the two Ki-Ki\nhad given them another mild look from their gentle blue eyes, these\nofficials clapped their twin hands together and the doors of gold flew\nopen.\n\nA perfect silence greeted them, during which the double Ki and the\ndouble Ki-Ki bent their four bodies low and advanced into the\nthrone-room, followed by Prince Marvel and Nerle.\n\nIn the center of the room stood two thrones of dainty filigree work in\nsolid gold, and over them were canopies of yellow velvet, the folds of\nwhich were caught up and draped with bands of green ribbon.  And on the\nthrones were seated two of the sweetest and fairest little maidens that\nmortal man had ever beheld.  Their lovely hair was fine as a spider's\nweb; their eyes were kind and smiling, their cheeks soft and dimpled,\ntheir mouths shapely as a cupid's bow and tinted like the petals of a\nrose.  Upon their heads were set two crowns of fine spun gold, worked\ninto fantastic shapes and set with glittering gems.  Their robes were\nsoft silks of pale yellow, with strings of sparkling emeralds for\nornament.\n\nAnything so lovely and fascinating as these little maids, who were\nprecisely alike in every particular, neither Prince Marvel nor Nerle\nhad ever dreamed could exist.  They stood for a time spellbound and\nfilled with admiration, while the two pairs of rulers bowed again and\nagain before the dainty and lovable persons of their High Ki.\n\nBut it was hard for Nerle to keep quiet for long, and presently he\nexclaimed, in a voice loud enough to be heard by all present:\n\n\"By the Great Kika-koo of our friends the Ki, these darling High Ki of\nTwi are sweet enough to be kissed!\"\n\n\n\n16.  The Rebellion of the High Ki\n\nThe bold speech of Nerle's made the two damsels laugh at the same time,\nand their sweet laughter sounded like rippling strains of harmonious\nmusic.  But the two Ki-Ki frowned angrily, and the two Ki looked at the\nboy in surprise, as if wondering at his temerity.\n\n\"Who are these strangers?\" asked the pretty High Ki, speaking together\nas all the twins of Twi did; \"and why are they not mates, but only half\nof each other?\"\n\n\"These questions, your Supreme Highnesses,\" said the blond-haired pair\nof Ki-Ki, \"we are unable to answer.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, then, the strangers can answer themselves,\" said the little\nmaids, smiling first upon the Ki-Ki and then upon the prisoners.\n\nPrince Marvel bowed.\n\n\"I am from the great outside world,\" said he, \"and my name is Prince\nMarvel.  Until now I have never seen people that live in pairs, and\nspeak in unison, and act in the same way and think the same thoughts.\nMy world is much bigger than your world, and in it every person is\nproud to think and act for himself.  You say I am only a 'half,' but\nthat is not so.  I am perfect, without a counterpart; my friend Nerle\nis perfect without a counterpart, and it is yourselves who are halved.\nFor in the Land of Twi no person is complete or perfect without its\nother half, and it seems to take two of you to make one man--or one\nmaid.\"\n\nThe sweet faces of the twin High Ki grew thoughtful at this speech, and\nthey said:\n\n\"Indeed, it may be you are right.  But it is our custom in Twi to do\neverything double and to live double.\" Then, turning to the Ki, they\nasked: \"Why have you brought these strangers here?\"\n\n\"To ask your Supreme Highnesses to permit them to return again to the\nworld from whence they came,\" answered the Ki, both of them regarding\ntheir supreme rulers earnestly.\n\nBut here the Ki-Ki spoke up quickly in their mild voices, saying:\n\n\"That is not our idea, your Highnesses.  We, the Ki-Ki of Twi, think it\nbest the strangers should be put to death.  And we pray your Supreme\nHighnesses to favor our wish.\"\n\nThe two little maids looked from the Ki to the Ki-Ki, and frowned and\npouted their rosy lips in evident perplexity.\n\nBut Nerle whispered to Prince Marvel:\n\n\"It's all up with us!  I know very well why her royal doublets always\nfavors the Ki-Ki.  It's because they are young and handsome, while the\nKi are old and ugly.  Both of her will condemn us to death--you see if\nshe don't!\"\n\nThis seemed somewhat mixed, but Nerle was in earnest, and Prince\nMarvel, who had not forgotten his fairy lore, began to weave a silent\nspell over the head of the nearest twin High Ki.  But just as it was\ncompleted, and before he had time to work the spell on the other twin,\nthe Ki-Ki grew impatient, and exclaimed:\n\n\"We beg your Highnesses not to keep us waiting.  Let us have your\ndecision at once!\"\n\nAnd the twin maidens raised their fair heads and replied.  But the\nreply was of such a nature that both the old Ki and both the young\nKi-Ki staggered backward in amazement.  For one of the twin High Ki\nsaid:\n\n\"They shall die!\"\n\nAnd the other twin High Ki said at the same instant:\n\n\"They shall NOT die!\"\n\nHad twin thunderbolts fallen through the twin roofs of the twin palaces\nand struck the twin Ki and the twin Ki-Ki upon their twin heads it\nwould have created no more stupendous a sensation than did this remark.\nNever before had any two halves of a twin of the Land of Twi thought\ndifferently or spoken differently.  Indeed, it startled the two maidens\nthemselves as much as it did their hearers, for each one turned her\nhead toward the other and, for the first time in her life, looked into\nthe other's face!\n\nThis act was fully as strange as their speech, and a sudden horrible\nthought came into the startled heads of the twin Ki and the twin Ki-Ki:\nTHE HIGH KI OF TWI WAS NO LONGER ONE, BUT TWO.  AND THESE TWO WERE\nTHINKING AND ACTING EACH INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER!\n\nIt is no wonder the shock rendered them speechless for a time, and they\nstood swaying their four bodies, with their eight eyes bulging out like\nthose of fishes and their four mouths wide open, as if the two pairs\nhad become one quartet.\n\nThe faces of the two maids flushed as they gazed upon each other.\n\n\"How DARE you contradict me?\" asked one.\n\n\"How dare you contradict ME?\" demanded the other, and not only were\nthese questions asked separately, but the accent on the words was\ndifferent.  And their twin minds seemed to get farther apart every\nmoment.\n\n\"I'm the High Ki of Twi!\" said one.\n\n\"You're not!  I'M the High Ki!\" retorted the other.\n\n\"The strangers shall die!\" snapped one.\n\n\"They shall live!\" cried the other.  \"My will is supreme.\"\n\n\"It's not!  MY will is supreme,\" returned the other twin.\n\nThe bald heads of the ancient Ki were bobbing in amazement, first to\none maid and then toward the other.  The blond hairs of the two Ki-Ki\nwere standing almost on end, and their eyes stared straight before them\nas if stupefied with astonishment.  Nerle was bellowing with rude\nlaughter and holding his sides to keep from getting a stitch in them,\nwhile Prince Marvel stood quietly attentive and smiling with genuine\namusement.  For he alone understood what had happened to separate the\ntwin High Ki.\n\nThe girls did not seem to know how to act under their altered\nconditions.  After a time one of them said:\n\n\"We will leave our dispute to be settled by the Ki and the Ki-Ki.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" agreed the other.\n\n\"Then I say your half is right,\" declared the Ki-Ki, both their right\nforefingers pointing to the maiden who had condemned the strangers to\ndeath.\n\n\"And I decide that your half is right,\" exclaimed the Ki, both their\ntrembling forefingers pointing to the maiden who had said the strangers\nshould live.\n\n\"Well?\" said one girl.\n\n\"Well?\" said the other.\n\n\"The powers of the Ki and the Ki-Ki are equal,\" said the first.  \"We\nare no nearer a settlement of our dispute than we were before.\"\n\n\"My dear young ladies,\" said Prince Marvel, politely, \"I beg you will\ntake time to think the matter over, and see if you can not come to an\nagreement.  We are in no hurry.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" decided the twins, speaking both together this time.  \"We\ncommand you all to remain in the palace until we have settled our own\nstrange dispute.  The servants will care for you, and when we are ready\nto announce our decision we shall again send for you.\"\n\nEvery one bowed at this command and retired from the room; but Nerle\nlooked over his shoulder as he went through the doorway, and saw that\nthe two High Ki had turned in their seats and were facing each other,\nand that both their faces wore angry and determined expressions.\n\n\n\n17.  The Separation of the High Ki\n\nFor nearly a week Prince Marvel and Nerle remained confined to the\npalace and gardens of the High Ki.  Together with the twin Ki, who\nseemed to be friendly to them, they occupied one of the twin palaces,\nwhile the Ki-Ki secluded themselves in the other.\n\nThe pretty High Ki maidens they did not see at all, nor did they know\nwhat part of the palaces they occupied, not being permitted to wander\naway from the rooms allotted to them, except to walk in the garden.\nThere was no way for them to escape, had they felt inclined to, for the\nsilver steps had disappeared.\n\nFrom the garden walks they sometimes caught sight of the solemn heads\nof the handsome Ki-Ki looking at them through the twin windows of the\nother palace, and although the expression of their faces was always\nmild and gentle, Nerle and Marvel well knew the Ki-Ki were only waiting\nin the hope of having them killed.\n\n\"Are you nervous about the decision of the pretty High Ki?\" asked Nerle\none day.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said the prince, laughing; \"for I do not expect them to\nkill me, in any event.\"\n\n\"If I felt as sure of my safety,\" returned the boy, \"it would destroy\nall my pleasure.  These are really happy days for me.  Every moment I\nexpect to see the executioner arrive with his ax.\"\n\n\"The executioner is double,\" said the two old Ki, breaking into the\nconversation.  \"You should say you expect to see the executioners\narrive with their axes.\"\n\n\"Then how will they cut off my head with two axes?  For I suppose they\nwill both chop at the same time, and I have but one neck.\"\n\n\"Wait and see,\" answered the two Ki, sighing deeply and rubbing their\nred noses thoughtfully.\n\n\"Oh, I'll wait,\" answered the boy; \"but as for seeing them cut off my\nhead, I refuse; for I intend to shut my eyes.\"\n\nSo they sat in their rooms or walked in the gardens, yawning and\nwaiting, until one day, just as the two clocks on the wall were\nstriking twenty-four o'clock, the door opened and to their surprise one\nof the High Ki twins walked in upon them.\n\nShe was as sweet and fair to look upon as when she occupied one of the\nbeautiful thrones, but at first no one could tell which of the High Ki\nshe was--their friend or their enemy.  Even the Ki were puzzled and\nanxious, until the girl said:\n\n\"My other half and I have completely separated, for we have agreed to\ndisagree for all time.  And she has gone to ask the Ki-Ki to assist\nher, for war is declared between us.  And hereafter her color is to be\nthe green and mine the yellow, and we intend to fight until one of us\nconquers and overthrows the other.\"\n\nThis announcement was interesting to Marvel and Nerle, but greatly\nshocked the aged Ki, who asked:\n\n\"What is to become of our kingdom?  Half of a High Ki can not rule it.\nIt is against the law.\"\n\n\"I will make my own laws when I have won the fight,\" returned the girl,\nwith a lovely smile; \"so do not let that bother you.  And now tell me,\nwill you help me to fight my battles?\"\n\n\"Willingly!\" exclaimed Nerle and Prince Marvel, almost as if they had\nbeen twins of Twi.  And the Ki rubbed their bald heads a moment, and\nthen sneezed together and wiped their eyes on faded yellow\nhandkerchiefs, and finally declared they would \"stick to her Supreme\nHighness through thick and thin!\"\n\n\"Then go over the wall to the cities, at once, and get together all the\nsoldiers to fight for me and my cause,\" commanded the girl.\n\nThe twin Ki at once left the room, and the High Ki sat down and began\nto ask questions of Prince Marvel and Nerle about the big outside world\nfrom whence they came.  Nerle was rather shy and bashful before the\ndainty little maiden, whose yellow robe contrasted delightfully with\nher pink cheeks and blue eyes and brown flowing locks; but Prince\nMarvel did not mind girls at all, so he talked with her freely, and she\nin return allowed him to examine the pretty gold crown she wore upon\nher brow.\n\nBy and by the Ki came back with both faces sad and gloomy.\n\n\"Your Highness,\" they announced, \"we have bad news for you.  The other\nHigh Ki, who is wearing a green gown, has been more prompt in action\nthan yourself.  She and the Ki-Ki have secured the silver steps and\nwill allow no others to use them; and already they have sent for the\nsoldiers of the royal armies to come and aid them.  So we are unable to\nleave the garden, and presently the army will be here to destroy us.\"\n\nThen the girl showed her good courage; for she laughed and said:\n\n\"Then we must remain here and fight to the last; and if I am unable to\nsave you, who are my friends, it will be because I can not save myself.\"\n\nThis speech pleased Prince Marvel greatly.  He kissed the little maid's\nhand respectfully and said:\n\n\"Fear nothing, your Highness.  My friend and I are not so helpless as\nyou think.  We consider it our privilege to protect and save you,\ninstead of your saving us; and we are really able to do this in spite\nof the other High Ki and her entire army.\"\n\nSo they remained quietly in the palace the rest of that day, and no one\nmolested them in the least.  In the evening the girl played and sang\nfor them, and the ancient pair of Ki danced a double-shuffle for their\namusement that nearly convulsed them with laughter.  For one danced\nexactly like the other, and the old men's legs were still very nimble,\nalthough their wrinkled faces remained anxiously grave throughout their\nantics.  Nerle also sang a song about the King of Thieves whom Prince\nMarvel had conquered, and another about the Red Rogue of Dawna, so that\naltogether the evening passed pleasantly enough, and they managed to\nforget all their uneasy doubts of the morrow.\n\nWhen at last they separated for the night, Prince Marvel alone did not\nseek his bed; there was still some business he wished to transact.  So\nhe shut himself up in his room and summoned before him, by means of his\nfairy knowledge, the Prince of the Knooks, the King of the Ryls and the\nGovernor of the Goblins.  These were all three his especial friends,\nand he soon told them the story of the quarrel and separation of the\ntwin High Ki, and claimed their assistance.  Then he told them how they\nmight aid him, and afterward dismissed them.  Having thus accomplished\nhis task, the fairy prince went to bed and slept peacefully the\nremainder of the night.\n\nThe next morning the blond Ki-Ki and all the army of Twi, which had\nbeen won to their cause, came climbing up the silver steps and over the\nwall to the palace of the green High Ki; but what was their amazement\nto find the twin palaces separated by a wall so high that no ladders\nnor steps they possessed could reach to the top!  It had been built in\na single night, and only Prince Marvel and his fairy friends knew how\nthe work had been done so quickly.\n\nThe yellow High Ki, coming downstairs to breakfast with her friends,\nfound herself securely shut in from her enemies, and the bald-headed\nold Ki were so pleased to escape that they danced another jig from pure\njoy.\n\nOver the wall could be heard the shouts and threats of the army of Twi,\nwho were seeking a way to get at the fugitives; but for the present our\nfriends knew themselves to be perfectly safe, and they could afford to\nlaugh at the fury of the entire population of Twi.\n\n\n\n18.  The Rescue of the High Ki\n\nAfter several days of siege Prince Marvel began to feel less confident\nof the safety of his little party.  The frantic Ki-Ki had built double\nbattering-rams and were trying to batter down the high wall; and they\nhad built several pairs of long ladders with which to climb over the\nwall; and their soldiers were digging two tunnels in the ground in\norder to crawl under the wall.\n\nNot at once could they succeed, for the wall was strong and it would\ntake long to batter it down; and Nerle stood on top of the wall and\nkicked over the ladders as fast as the soldiers of Twi set them up; and\nthe gray-bearded Ki stood in the garden holding two big flat boards\nwith which to whack the heads of any who might come through the tunnels.\n\nBut Prince Marvel realized that the perseverance of his foes might win\nin the end, unless he took measures to defeat them effectually.  So he\nsummoned swift messengers from among the Sound Elves, who are\naccustomed to travel quickly, and they carried messages from him to\nWul-Takim, the King of the Reformed Thieves, and to King Terribus of\nSpor, who had both promised him their assistance in case he needed it.\nThe prince did not tell his friends of this action, but after the\nmessengers had been dispatched he felt easier in his mind.\n\nThe little High Ki remained as sweet and brave and lovable as ever,\nstriving constantly to cheer and encourage her little band of\ndefenders.  But none of them was very much worried, and Nerle confided\nto the maiden in yellow the fact that he expected to suffer quite\nagreeably when the Ki-Ki at last got him in their clutches.\n\nFinally a day came when two big holes were battered through the wall,\nand then the twin soldiers of Twi poured through the holes and began to\npound on the doors of the palace itself, in which Prince Marvel and\nNerle, the Ki and the yellow High Ki had locked themselves as securely\nas possible.\n\nThe prince now decided it was high time for his friends to come to\ntheir rescue; but they did not appear, and before long the doors of the\npalace gave way and the soldiers rushed upon them in a vast throng.\n\nNerle wanted to fight, and to slay as many of the Twi people as\npossible; but the prince would not let him.\n\n\"These poor soldiers are but doing what they consider their duty,\" he\nsaid, \"and it would be cruel to cut them down with our swords.  Have\npatience, I pray you.  Our triumph will come in good time.\"\n\nThe Ki-Ki, who came into the palace accompanied by the green High Ki,\nordered the twin soldiers to bind all the prisoners with cords.  So one\npair of soldiers bound the Ki and another pair Nerle and the prince,\nusing exactly the same motions in the operation.  But when it came to\nbinding the yellow High Ki the scene was very funny.  For twin soldiers\ntried to do the binding, and there was only one to bind; so that one\nsoldier went through the same motions as his twin on empty air, and\nwhen his other half had firmly bound the girl, his own rope fell\nharmless to the ground.  But it seemed impossible for one of the twins\nto do anything different from the other, so that was the only way the\nact could be accomplished.\n\nThen the green-robed High Ki walked up to the one in yellow and laughed\nin her face, saying:\n\n\"You now see which of us is the most powerful, and therefore the most\nworthy to rule.  Had you remained faithful to our handsome Ki-Ki, as I\ndid, you would not now be defeated and disgraced.\"\n\n\"There is no disgrace in losing one battle,\" returned the other girl,\nproudly.  \"You are mistaken if you think you have conquered me, and you\nare wrong to insult one who is, for the time being, your captive.\"\n\nThe maiden in green looked for an instant confused and ashamed; then\nshe tossed her pretty head and walked away.\n\nThey led all the prisoners out into the garden and then through the\nbroken wall, and up and down the silver steps, into the great square of\nthe cities of Twi.  And here all the population crowded around them,\nfor this was the first time any of them had seen their High Ki, or even\nknown that they were girls; and the news of their quarrel and\nseparation had aroused a great deal of excitement.\n\n\"Let the executioners come forward!\" cried the Ki-Ki, gleefully, and in\nanswer to the command the twin executioners stepped up to the prisoners.\n\nThey were big men, these executioners, each having a squint in one eye\nand a scar on the left cheek.  They polished their axes a moment on\ntheir coat-sleeves, and then said to Prince Marvel and Nerle, who were\nto be the first victims:\n\n\"Don't dodge, please, or our axes may not strike the right place.  And\ndo not be afraid, for the blows will only hurt you an instant.  In the\nLand of Twi it is usually considered a pleasure to be executed by us,\nwe are so exceedingly skillful.\"\n\n\"I can well believe that,\" replied Nerle, although his teeth were\nchattering.\n\nBut at this instant a loud shout was heard, and the twin people of Twi\nall turned their heads to find themselves surrounded by throngs of\nfierce enemies.\n\nPrince Marvel smiled, for he saw among the new-comers the giants and\ndwarfs and the stern Gray Men of King Terribus, with their monarch\ncalmly directing their movements; and on the other side of the circle\nwere the jolly faces and bushy whiskers of the fifty-nine reformed\nthieves, with burly Wul-Takim at their head.\n\n\n\n19.  The Reunion of the High Ki\n\nThe twins of Twi were too startled and amazed to offer to fight with\nthe odd people surrounding them.  Even the executioners allowed their\naxes to fall harmlessly to the ground, and the double people, soldiers\nand citizens alike, turned to stare at the strangers in wonder.\n\n\"We're here, Prince!\" yelled Wul-Takim, his bristly beard showing over\nthe heads of those who stood between.\n\n\"Thank you,\" answered Prince Marvel.\n\n\"And the men of Spor are here!\" added King Terribus, who was mounted on\na fine milk-white charger, richly caparisoned.\n\n\"I thank the men of Spor,\" returned Prince Marvel, graciously.\n\n\"Shall we cut your foes into small pieces, or would you prefer to hang\nthem?\" questioned the King of the Reformed Thieves, loudly enough to\nset most of his hearers shivering.\n\nBut now the little maid in yellow stepped up to Prince Marvel and,\nregarding the youthful knight with considerable awe, said sweetly:\n\n\"I beg you will pardon my people and spare them.  They are usually good\nand loyal subjects, and if they fought against me--their lawful High\nKi--it was only because they were misled by my separation from my other\nhalf.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied the prince; \"and as you are still the lawful\nHigh Ki of Twi, I will leave you to deal with your own people as you\nsee fit.  For those who have conquered your people are but your own\nallies, and are still under your orders, as I am myself.\"\n\nHearing this, the green High Ki walked up to her twin High Ki and said,\nboldly:\n\n\"I am your prisoner.  It is now your turn.  Do with me as you will.\"\n\n\"I forgive you,\" replied her sister, in kindly tones.\n\nThen the little maid who had met with defeat gave a sob and turned away\nweeping, for she had expected anything but forgiveness.\n\nAnd now the Ki-Ki came forward and, bowing their handsome blond heads\nbefore the High Ki, demanded: \"Are we forgiven also?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl, \"but you are no longer fit to be rulers of my\npeople.  Therefore, you are henceforth deprived of your honorable\noffices of Ki-Ki, which I shall now bestow upon these good captains\nhere,\" and she indicated the good-natured officers who had first\ncaptured the prince and Nerle.\n\nThe people of Twi eagerly applauded this act, for the captains were\nmore popular with them than the former Ki-Ki; but the blond ones both\nflushed with humiliation and anger, and said:\n\n\"The captains fought against you, even as we did.\"\n\n\"Yet the captains only obeyed your orders,\" returned the High Ki.  \"So\nI hold them blameless.\"\n\n\"And what is to become of us now?\" asked the former Ki-Ki.\n\n\"You will belong to the common people, and earn your living playing\ntunes for them to dance by,\" answered the High Ki.  And at this retort\nevery one laughed, so that the handsome youths turned away with twin\nscowls upon their faces and departed amidst the jeers of the crowd.\n\n\"Better hang 'em to a tree, little one,\" shouted Wul-Takim, in his big\nvoice; \"they won't enjoy life much, anyhow.\"\n\nBut the maid shook her pretty head and turned to the prince.\n\n\"Will you stay here and help me to rule my kingdom?\" she asked.\n\n\"I can not do that,\" replied Prince Marvel, \"for I am but a wandering\nadventurer and must soon continue my travels.  But I believe you will\nbe able to rule your people without my help.\"\n\n\"It is not so easy a task,\" she answered, sighing.  \"For I am singular\nand my people are all double.\"\n\n\"Well, let us hold a meeting in your palace,\" said the prince, \"and\nthen we can decide what is best to be done.\"\n\nSo they dismissed the people, who cheered their High Ki\nenthusiastically, returning quietly to their daily tasks and the gossip\nthat was sure to follow such important events as they had witnessed.\n\nThe army of King Terribus and the fifty-nine reformed thieves went to\nthe twin palaces of the Ki and the Ki-Ki and made merry with feasting\nand songs to celebrate their conquest.  And the High Ki, followed by\nthe prince, Nerle, King Terribus and Wul-Takim, as well as by the Ki\nand the newly-appointed Ki-Ki, mounted the silver steps and passed over\nthe wall to the royal palaces.  The green High Ki followed them, still\nweeping disconsolately.\n\nWhen they had all reached the throne-room, the High Ki seated herself\non one of the beautiful thrones and said:\n\n\"By some strange chance, which I am unable to explain, my twin and I\nhave become separated; so that instead of thinking and acting alike, we\nare now individuals--as are all the strange men who have passed through\nthe hole in the hedge.  And, being individuals, we can no longer agree,\nnor can one of us lawfully rule over the Kingdom of Twi, where all the\nsubjects are twins, thinking and acting in unison.\"\n\nSaid Prince Marvel:\n\n\"Your Highness, I alone can explain why you became separated from your\ntwin.  By means of a fairy enchantment, which I learned years ago, I\nworked upon you a spell, which compelled your brain to work independent\nof your sister's brain.  It seems to me that it is better each person\nshould think her own thoughts and live her own life, rather than be\nyoked to another person and obliged to think and act as a twin, or\none-half of a complete whole.  And since you are now the one High Ki,\nand the acknowledged ruler of this country, I will agree to work the\nsame fairy spell on all your people, so that no longer will there be\ntwin minds in all this Land of Twi.\"\n\n\"But all the cows and dogs and horses and other animals are double, as\nwell as the people,\" suggested the old Ki, blinking their little eyes\nin amazement at the thought of being forever separated from each other.\n\n\"I can also work the spell upon all the twin animals,\" said the prince,\nafter a moment's hesitation.\n\n\"And all our houses are built double, with twin doors and windows and\nchimneys, to accommodate our twin people,\" continued the High Ki.  \"And\nthe trees and flowers--and even the blades of grass--are all double.\nAnd our roads are double, and--and everything else is double.  I alone,\nthe ruler of this land, am singular!\"\n\nPrince Marvel became thoughtful now, for he did not know how to\nseparate trees and flowers, and it would be a tedious task to separate\nthe twin houses.\n\n\"Why not leave the country as it is?\" asked King Terribus of Spor.\n\"The High Ki is welcome to come to my castle to live, and then she need\nno longer bother about the Land of Twi, which seems to me a poor place,\nafter all.\"\n\n\"And your sister may come with me to my cave, and be the queen of the\nreformed thieves, which is a much more important office than being High\nKi of Twi,\" added big Wul-Takim, who had placed the maiden in green\nupon a cushion at his feet, and was striving to comfort her by gently\nstroking her silken hair with his rough hand.\n\n\"But I love my country, and do not wish to leave it,\" answered the\nyellow High Ki.  \"And I love my twin sister, and regret that our minds\nhave become separated,\" she continued, sadly.\n\n\"I have it!\" exclaimed Nerle.  \"Let the prince reunite you, making you\nregular twins of Twi again, and then you can continue to rule the\ncountry as the double High Ki, and everything will be as it was before.\"\n\nThe yellow High Ki clapped her pink hands with delight and looked\neagerly at the prince.\n\n\"Will you?\" she asked.  \"Will you please reunite us?  And then all our\ntroubles will be ended!\"\n\nThis really seemed to Marvel the best thing to be done.  So he led the\nmaid in green to the other throne, where she had once sat, and after\nreplacing the golden crown upon her brow he whispered a fairy spell of\nmuch mystical power.\n\nThen the prince stepped back and regarded the maidens earnestly, and\nafter a moment both the High Ki smiled upon him in unison and\nsaid--speaking the same words in the same voices and with the same\naccents:\n\n\"Thank you very much!\"\n\n\n\n20.  Kwytoffle, the Tyrant\n\nHaving restored the High Ki to their former condition, to the great joy\nof the ancient Ki, Prince Marvel led his friends back to the palaces\nwhere his men were waiting.\n\nThey were just in time to prevent serious trouble, for the fifty-eight\nreformed thieves had been boasting of their prowess to the huge giants\nand tiny dwarfs of King Terribus, and this had resulted in a quarrel as\nto which were the best fighters.  Had not their masters arrived at the\nright moment there would certainly have been a fierce battle and much\nbloodshed,--and all over something of no importance.\n\nTerribus and Wul-Takim soon restored order, and then they accompanied\nthe Ki and the Ki-Ki to the public square, where the people were\ninformed that their Supreme Highnesses, the High Ki, had been reunited\nand would thereafter rule them with twin minds as well as twin bodies.\nThere was great rejoicing at this news, for every twin in Twi was glad\nto have his troubles ended so easily and satisfactorily.\n\nThat night the ryls and knooks and other invisible friends of Prince\nMarvel came and removed the dividing wall between the twin palaces of\nthe High Ki, repairing speedily all the damage that had been done.  And\nwhen our friends called upon the High Ki the next morning they found\nthe two maids again dressed exactly alike in yellow robes, with strings\nof sparkling emeralds for ornament.  And not even Prince Marvel could\nnow tell one of the High Ki from the other.\n\nAs for the maids themselves, it seemed difficult to imagine they had\never existed apart for a single moment.\n\nThey were very pleasant and agreeable to their new friends, and when\nthey heard that Prince Marvel was about to leave them to seek new\nadventures they said:\n\n\"Please take us with you!  It seems to us that we ought to know\nsomething of the big outside world from whence you came.  If we see\nother kingdoms and people we shall be better able to rule our own\nwisely.\"\n\n\"That seems reasonable,\" answered Marvel, \"and I shall be very glad to\nhave you accompany me.  But who will rule the Land of Twi in your\nabsence?\"\n\n\"The Ki-Ki shall be the rulers,\" answered the High Ki, \"and we will\ntake the Ki with us.\"\n\n\"Then I will delay my departure until to-morrow morning,\" said the\nprince, \"in order that your Highnesses may have time to prepare for the\njourney.\"\n\nAnd then he went back to the palaces of the other rulers, where the Ki\nexpressed themselves greatly pleased at the idea of traveling, and the\nnew Ki-Ki were proud to learn they should rule for some time the Land\nof Twi.\n\nWul-Takim also begged to join the party, and so also did King Terribus,\nwho had never before been outside of his own Kingdom of Spor; so Prince\nMarvel willingly consented.\n\nThe fifty-eight reformed thieves, led by Gunder, returned to their\ncave, where they were living comfortably on the treasure Prince Marvel\nhad given them; and the Gray Men and giants and dwarfs of Spor departed\nfor their own country.\n\nIn the morning Prince Marvel led his own gay cavalcade through the hole\nin the hedge, and they rode merrily away in search of adventure.\n\nBy his side were the High Ki, mounted upon twin chestnut ponies that\nhad remarkably slender limbs and graceful, arched necks.  The ponies\nmoved with exactly the same steps, and shook their manes and swished\ntheir tails at exactly the same time.  Behind the prince and the High\nKi were King Terribus, riding his great white charger, and Wul-Takim on\na stout horse of jet-black color.  The two ancient Ki and Nerle, being\nof lesser rank than the others, brought up the rear.\n\n\"When we return to our Land of Twi,\" said the High Ki, \"we shall close\nup for all time the hole you made in the hedge; for, if we are\ndifferent from the rest of the world, it is better that we remain in\nseclusion.\"\n\n\"I think it is right you should do that,\" replied Prince Marvel.  \"Yet\nI do not regret that I cut a hole in your hedge.\"\n\n\"It was the hedge that delayed us in coming more promptly to your\nassistance,\" said Terribus; \"for we had hard work to find the hole you\nhad made, and so lost much valuable time.\"\n\n\"All is well that ends well!\" laughed the prince.  \"You certainly came\nin good time to rescue us from our difficulties.\"\n\nThey turned into a path that led to Auriel, which Nerle had heard\nspoken of as \"the Kingdom of the Setting Sun.\"\n\nSoon the landscape grew very pleasant to look upon, the meadows being\nbroad and green, with groups of handsome trees standing about.  The\ntwilight of the Land of Twi was now replaced by bright sunshine, and in\nthe air was the freshness of the near-by sea.\n\nAt evening they came to a large farmhouse, where the owner welcomed\nthem hospitably and gave them the best his house afforded.\n\nIn answer to their questions about the Kingdom of Auriel, he shook his\nhead sadly and replied:\n\n\"It is a rich and beautiful country, but has fallen under great\nmisfortunes.  For when the good king died, about two years ago, the\nkingdom was seized by a fierce and cruel sorcerer, named Kwytoffle, who\nrules the people with great severity, and makes them bring him all\ntheir money and valuable possessions.  So every one is now very poor\nand unhappy, and that is a great pity in a country so fair and fertile.\"\n\n\"But why do not the people rebel?\" asked Nerle.\n\n\"They dare not rebel,\" answered the farmer, \"because they fear the\nsorcery of Kwytoffle.  If they do not obey him he threatens to change\nthem into grasshoppers and June-bugs.\"\n\n\"Has he ever changed any one into a grasshopper or a June-bug?\" asked\nPrince Marvel.\n\n\"No; but the people are too frightened to oppose him, and so he does\nnot get the opportunity.  And he has an army of fierce soldiers, who\nare accustomed to beat the people terribly if they do not carry every\nbit of their wealth to the sorcerer.  So there is no choice but to obey\nhim.\"\n\n\"We certainly ought to hang this wicked creature!\" exclaimed Wul-Takim.\n\n\"I wish I had brought my Fool-Killer with me,\" sighed King Terribus;\n\"for I could have kept him quite busy in this kingdom.\"\n\n\"Can not something be done to rescue these poor people from their sad\nfate?\" asked the lovely High Ki, anxiously.\n\n\"We will make a call upon this Kwytoffle to-morrow,\" answered Prince\nMarvel, \"and see what the fellow is like.\"\n\n\"Alas!  Alas!\" wailed the good farmer, \"you will all become\ngrasshoppers and June-bugs--every one of you!\"\n\nBut none of the party seemed to fear that, and having passed the night\ncomfortably with the farmer they left his house and journeyed on into\nthe Kingdom of Auriel.\n\nBefore noon they came upon the edge of a forest, where a poor man was\nchopping logs into firewood.  Seeing Prince Marvel's party approach,\nthis man ran toward them waving his hands and shouting excitedly:\n\n\"Take the other path!  Take the other path!\"\n\n\"And why should we take the other path?\" inquired the prince, reining\nin his steed.\n\n\"Because this one leads to the castle of the great sorcerer,\nKwytoffle,\" answered the man.\n\n\"But there is where we wish to go,\" said Marvel.\n\n\"What!  You wish to go there?\" cried the man.  \"Then you will be robbed\nand enslaved!\"\n\n\"Not as long as we are able to fight,\" laughed the big Wul-Takim.\n\n\"If you resist the sorcerer, you will be turned into grasshoppers and\nJune-bugs,\" declared the man, staring at them in wonder.\n\n\"How do you know that?\" asked Marvel.\n\n\"Kwytoffle says so.  He promises to enchant every one who dares defy\nhis power.\"\n\n\"Has any one ever yet dared defy him?\" asked Nerle.\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said the man.  \"No one wishes to become a June-bug or\na grasshopper.  No one dares defy him.\".\n\n\"I am anxious to see this sorcerer,\" exclaimed King Terribus.  \"He\nought to prove an interesting person, for he is able to accomplish his\npurposes by threats alone.\"\n\n\"Then let us ride on,\" said Marvel.\n\n\"Dear us!  Dear us!\" remonstrated the bald-headed Ki; \"are we to become\ngrasshoppers, then?\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" returned the prince, briefly.\n\n\"With your long legs,\" added the pretty pair of High Ki, laughingly,\n\"you ought to be able to jump farther than any other grasshopper in the\nkingdom.\"\n\n\"Great Kika-koo!\" cried the Ki, nervously, \"what a fate! what a\nterrible fate!  And your Highnesses, I suppose, will become June-bugs,\nand flutter your wings with noises like buzz-saws!\"\n\n\n\n21.  The Wonderful Book of Magic\n\nWhatever their fears might be, none of Prince Marvel's party hesitated\nto follow him along the path through the forest in search of the\nsorcerer, and by and by they came upon a large clearing.  In the middle\nof this open space was a big building in such bad repair that its walls\nwere tumbling down in several places, and all around it the ground was\nuncared for and littered with rubbish.  A man was walking up and down\nin front of this building, with his head bowed low; but when he heard\nthe sound of approaching horses' hoofs he looked up and stared for a\nmoment in amazement.  Then, with a shout of rage, he rushed toward them\nand caught Prince Marvel's horse by the bridle.\n\n\"How dare you!\" he cried; \"how dare you enter my forest?\"\n\nMarvel jerked his bridle from the man's grasp and said in return:\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Me!  Who am I?  Why, I am the great and powerful Kwytoffle!  So\nbeware!  Beware my sorcery!\"\n\nThey all looked at the man curiously.  He was short and very fat, and\nhad a face like a puff-ball, with little red eyes and scarcely any nose\nat all.  He wore a black gown with scarlet grasshoppers and june-bugs\nembroidered upon the cloth; and his hat was high and peaked, with an\nimitation grasshopper of extraordinary size perched upon its point.  In\nhis right hand he carried a small black wand, and around his neck hung\na silver whistle on a silver cord.\n\nSeeing that the strangers were gazing on him so earnestly, Kwytoffle\nthought they were frightened; so he said again, in a big voice:\n\n\"Beware my vengeance!\"\n\n\"Beware yourself!\" retorted the prince.  \"For if you do not treat us\nmore respectfully, I shall have you flogged.\"\n\n\"What!  Flog me!\" shouted Kwytoffle, furiously.  \"For this I will turn\nevery one of you into grasshoppers--unless you at once give me all the\nwealth you possess!\"\n\n\"Poor man!\" exclaimed Nerle; \"I can see you are longing for that\nflogging.  Will you have it now?\" and he raised his riding-whip above\nhis head.\n\nKwytoffle stumbled backward a few paces and blew shrilly upon his\nsilver whistle.  Instantly a number of soldiers came running from the\nbuilding, others following quickly after them until fully a hundred\nrough-looking warriors, armed with swords and axes, had formed in\nbattle array, facing the little party of Prince Marvel.\n\n\"Arrest these strangers!\" commanded Kwytoffle, in a voice like a roar.\n\"Capture them and bind them securely, and then I will change them all\ninto grasshoppers!\"\n\n\"All right,\" answered the captain of the soldiers; and then he turned\nto his men and shouted: \"Forward--double-quick--march!\"\n\nThey came on with drawn swords; at first running, and then gradually\ndropping into a walk, as they beheld Nerle, Wul-Takim, King Terribus\nand Marvel standing quietly waiting to receive them, weapons in hand\nand ready for battle.  A few paces off the soldiers hesitated and\nstopped altogether, and Kwytoffle yelled at the captain:\n\n\"Why don't you go on?  Why don't you capture them?  Why don't you fight\nthem?\"\n\n\"Why, they have drawn their swords!\" responded the captain,\nreproachfully.\n\n\"Who cares?\" roared the sorcerer.\n\n\"We care,\" said the captain, giving a shudder, as he looked upon the\nstrangers.  \"Their swords are sharp, and some of us would get hurt.\"\n\n\"You're cowards!\" shrieked the enraged Kwytoffle.  \"I'll turn you all\ninto June-bugs!\"\n\nAt this threat the soldiers dropped their swords and axes, and all fell\nupon their knees, trembling visibly and imploring their cruel master\nnot to change them into june-bugs.\n\n\"Bah!\" cried Nerle, scornfully; \"why don't you fight?  If we kill you,\nthen you will escape being June-bugs.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the captain, woefully, \"we simply can't fight.  For\nour swords are only tin, and our axes are made of wood, with\nsilver-paper pasted over them.\"\n\n\"But why is that?\" asked Wul-Takim, while all the party showed their\nsurprise.\n\n\"Why, until now we have never had any need to fight,\" said the captain,\n\"for every one has quickly surrendered to us or run away the moment we\ncame near.  But you people do not appear to be properly frightened, and\nnow, alas! since you have drawn upon us the great sorcerer's anger, we\nshall all be transformed into June-bugs.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" roared Kwytoffle, hopping up and down with anger, \"you shall all\nbe June-bugs, and these strangers I will transform into grasshoppers!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Prince Marvel, quietly; \"you can do it now.\"\n\n\"I will!  I will!\" cried the sorcerer.\n\n\"Then why don't you begin?\" inquired the prince.\n\n\"Why don't I begin?  Why, I haven't got the enchantments with me,\nthat's why.  Do you suppose we great magicians carry around\nenchantments in our pockets?\" returned the other, in a milder tone.\n\n\"Where do you keep your enchantments?\" asked the prince.\n\n\"They're in my dwelling,\" snapped Kwytoffle, taking off his hat and\nfanning his fat face with the brim.\n\n\"Then go and get them,\" said Marvel.\n\n\"Nonsense!  If I went to get the enchantments you would all run away!\"\nretorted the sorcerer.\n\n\"Not so!\" protested Nerle, who was beginning to be amused.  \"My\ngreatest longing in life is to become a grasshopper.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!  PLEASE let us be grasshoppers!\" exclaimed the High Ki maids\nin the same breath.\n\n\"We want to hop!  We want to hop!  Please--PLEASE let us hop!\" implored\nthe bald-headed Ki, winking their left eyes at Wul-Takim.\n\n\"By all means let us become grasshoppers,\" said King Terribus, smiling;\nand Wul-Takim added:\n\n\"I'm sure your soldiers would enjoy being June-bugs, for then they\nwouldn't have to work.  Isn't that so, boys?\"\n\nThe bewildered soldiers looked at one another in perplexity, and the\nstill more bewildered sorcerer gazed on the speakers with staring eyes\nand wide-open mouth.\n\n\"I insist,\" said Prince Marvel, \"upon your turning us into grasshoppers\nand your soldiers into June-bugs, as you promised.  If you do not, then\nI will flog you--as I promised.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" returned the sorcerer, with a desperate look upon his\nface; \"I'll go and find the enchantment.\"\n\n\"And we'll go with you,\" remarked the prince, pleasantly.\n\nSo the entire party accompanied Kwytoffle into the house, where they\nentered a large room that was in a state of much disorder.\n\n\"Let me see,\" said the sorcerer, rubbing his ears, as if trying to\nthink; \"I wonder if I put them in this cupboard.  You see,\" he\nexplained, \"no one has ever before dared me to transform him into a\nJune-bug or grasshopper, so I have almost forgotten where I keep my\nbook of enchantments.  No, it's not in the cupboard,\" he continued,\nlooking there; \"but it surely must be in this chest.\"\n\nIt was not in the chest, either, and so the sorcerer continued to look\nin all sorts of queer places for his book of enchantments, without\nfinding it.  Whenever he paused in his search Prince Marvel would say,\nsternly:\n\n\"Go on!  Find the book!  Hunt it up.  We are all anxious to become\ngrasshoppers.\"  And then Kwytoffle would set to work again, although\nbig drops of perspiration were now streaming down his face.\n\nFinally he pulled an old book from underneath the pillow of his bed,\nand crying, \"Here it is!\" carried it to the window.\n\nHe turned a few leaves of the book and then said:\n\n\"How unfortunate!  The compound I require to change you into\ngrasshoppers must be mixed on the first day of September; and as this\nis now the eighth day of September I must wait nearly a year before I\ncan work the enchantment.\"\n\n\"How about the June-bugs?\" asked Nerle.\n\n\"Oh!  Ah!  The June-bug mixture can only be made at the dark o' the\nmoon,\" said the sorcerer, pretending to read, \"and that is three weeks\nfrom now.\"\n\n\"Let me read it,\" said Prince Marvel, suddenly snatching the book from\nKwytoffle's hands.  Then he turned to the title-page and read:\n\n\"'Lives of Famous Thieves and Impostors.'  Why, this is not a book of\nenchantments.\"\n\n\"That is what I suspected,\" said Terribus.\n\n\"No one but a sorcerer can read the enchantments in this book,\"\ndeclared Kwytoffle; but he hung his head with a sheepish look, for he\nknew his deception had been well understood.\n\n\"Is your own history written in this volume?\" inquired Marvel.\n\n\"No,\" answered the sorcerer.\n\n\"Then it ought to be,\" said the prince, \"for you are no sorcerer at\nall, but merely a thief and an impostor!\"\n\n\n\n22.  The Queen of Plenta\n\nThe soldiers of Kwytoffle wanted to hang their old master at once, for\nhe had won their enmity by abusing them in many ways; but Prince Marvel\nwould not let them do this.  However, they tied the false sorcerer to a\npost, and the captain gave him a good whipping--one lash for each\nletter in the words \"grasshopper\" and \"June-bug.\"  Kwytoffle howled\nloudly for mercy, but no one was at all sorry for him.\n\nWul-Takim tied a rope around the impostor's neck, and when the party\nleft the castle they journeyed all through the kingdom of Auriel, and\nat every town or city they came to the reformed thief would cry out to\nthe populace:\n\n\"Here is the terrible sorcerer Kwytoffle, who threatened to change you\ninto grasshoppers and june-bugs.  But you may see that he is a very\ncommon man, with no powers of sorcery whatever!\"\n\nAnd then the people would laugh and pelt mud at their former tyrant,\nand thank Prince Marvel for haying exposed the false and wicked\ncreature.\n\nAnd they called the son of their old king back to his lawful throne,\nwhere he ruled wisely and well; and the hoarded wealth of Kwytoffle was\ndivided among the people again, and soon the country became prosperous\nonce more.\n\nThis adventure was very amusing to the pretty High Ki of Twi.  It\nafforded them laughter for many days, and none of the party ever saw a\ngrasshopper or a june-bug afterward without thinking of the terrible\nsorcerer Kwytoffle.\n\nThey left that disgraced person grooming horses for his board in the\nstables of the new king, and proceeded upon their journey.\n\nWithout further event they reached the splendid southern Kingdom of\nPlenta, which was the most delightfully situated of any dominion in the\nEnchanted Island of Yew.  It was ruled by a good and generous queen,\nwho welcomed the strangers to her palace and gave a series of gay\nentertainments in their honor.\n\nKing Terribus was especially an object of interest, for every one had\nheard his name and feared him and his fierce people.  But when they\nbeheld his pleasant countenance and listened to his gentle voice they\nbegan to regard him with much love and respect; and really Terribus was\nworthy of their friendship since he had changed from a deformed monster\ninto an ordinary man, and had forbidden his people ever again to rob\nand plunder their weaker neighbors.\n\nBut the most popular personages visiting at the court of the Queen of\nPlenta were the lovely High Ki of Twi.  Although beautiful girls\nabounded in this kingdom, none could compare with the royal twins, and\ntheir peculiar condition only served to render them the more\ninteresting.\n\nTwo youths would approach the High Ki at the same time and invite them\nto dance, and in united voices they would accept the invitation and go\nwhirling around the room with exactly the same steps, laughing at the\nsame instant and enjoying the dance equally.  But if one youth asked\nhis partner a question, both the twins would make answer, and that was\nsure to confuse and embarrass the youth.  Still, the maids managed very\nwell to adapt themselves to the ways of people who were singular,\nalthough they sometimes became a little homesick for Twi, where they\nwere like all the other people.\n\nThe bald-headed Ki kept watchful eyes on their youthful rulers, and\nserved them very cheerfully.  But with all their travels and\nexperiences, the old men could never be convinced it was better to be\nsingular than double.\n\nPrince Marvel was the real hero of the party, and Nerle received much\nattention on account of his master's popularity.  He did not seem as\nunhappy as usual, and when the prince inquired the reason, his esquire\nanswered that he believed the excitement of their adventures was fast\ncuring him of his longing for something he could not have.  As for the\npleasure of suffering, he had had some experience of that, too, and it\nwas not nearly so delightful as he had expected.\n\nWul-Takim was not a society man, so he stayed around the royal stables\nand made friends with the grooms, and traded his big black horse for\ntwo bay ones and a gold neck-chain, and was fairly content with his lot.\n\nAnd so the party enjoyed several happy weeks at the court of the good\nQueen of Plenta, until one day the terrible news arrived that carried\nthem once more into exciting adventures.\n\n\n\n23.  The Red Rogue of Dawna\n\nOne morning, while they were all standing in the courtyard waiting for\ntheir horses, as they were about to go for a ride, a courier came\ngalloping swiftly up to the palace and cried:\n\n\"Does any one know where Prince Marvel can be found?\"\n\n\"I am Prince Marvel,\" replied the young knight, stepping out from among\nthe others.\n\n\"Then have I reached my journey's end!\" said the courier, whose horse\nwas nearly exhausted from long and hard riding.  \"The Lady Seseley is\nin great danger, and sends for you to come and rescue her.  The great\nBaron Merd, her father, has been killed and his castle destroyed, and\nall his people are either captives or have been slain outright.\"\n\n\"And who has done this evil thing?\" asked Prince Marvel, looking very\nstern and grave.\n\n\"The Red Rogue of Dawna,\" answered the messenger.  \"He quarreled with\nthe Baron Merd and sent his savage hordes to tear down his castle and\nslay him.  I myself barely escaped with my life, and the Lady Seseley\nhad but time to say, before she was carried off, that if I could find\nPrince Marvel he would surely rescue her.\"\n\n\"And so I will!\" declared the prince, \"if she be still alive.\"\n\n\"Who is this Lady Seseley?\" asked Nerle, who had come to his master's\nside.\n\n\"She is my first friend, to whom I owe my very existence.  It is her\nimage, together with those of her two friends, which is graven on my\nshield,\" answered Prince Marvel, thoughtfully.\n\n\"And what will you do?\" inquired the esquire.\n\n\"I must go to her at once.\"\n\nWhen they heard of his mission all the party insisted on accompanying\nhim.  Even the dainty High Ki could not be deterred by any thoughts of\ndangers they might encounter; and after some discussion Prince Marvel\nallowed them to join him.\n\nSo Wul-Takim sharpened his big broadsword, and Nerle carefully prepared\nhis master's horse, so that before an hour had passed they were\ngalloping toward the province of the Red Rogue of Dawna.\n\nPrince Marvel knew little concerning this personage, but Nerle had much\nto tell of him.  The Red Rogue had once been page to a wise scholar and\nmagician, who lived in a fine old castle in Dawna and ruled over a\nlarge territory.  The boy was very small and weak--smaller even than\nthe average dwarf--and his master did not think it worth while to watch\nhim.  But one evening, while the magician was standing upon the top of\nthe highest tower of his castle, the boy gave him a push from behind,\nand he met death on the sharp rocks below.  Then the boy took his\nmaster's book of magic and found a recipe to make one grow.  He made\nthe mixture and swallowed it, and straightway began to grow big and\ntall.  This greatly delighted him, until he found he was getting much\nbigger than the average man and rapidly becoming a giant.  So he sought\nfor a way to arrest the action of the magical draft; but before he\ncould find it he had grown to enormous proportions, and was bigger than\nthe biggest giant.  There was nothing in the book of magic to make one\ngrow smaller, so he was obliged to remain as he was--the largest man in\nthe Enchanted Island.\n\nAll this had happened in a single night.  The morning after his\nmaster's murder the page announced himself lord of the castle; and,\nseeing his enormous size, none dared deny his right to rule.  On\naccount of his bushy hair, which was fiery red in color, and the bushy\nred beard that covered his face when he became older, people came to\ncall him the Red One.  And after his evil deeds and quarrelsome temper\nhad made him infamous throughout the island, people began to call him\nthe Red Rogue of Dawna.\n\nHe had gathered around him a number of savage barbarians, as wicked and\nquarrelsome as himself, and so none dared to interfere with him, or\neven to meet him, if it were possible to avoid it.\n\nThis same Red Rogue it was who had drawn the good Baron Merd into a\nquarrel and afterward slain the old knight and his followers, destroyed\nhis castle, and carried his little daughter Seseley and her girl\nfriends, Berna and Helda, into captivity, shutting them up in his own\ngloomy castle.\n\nThe Red Rogue thought he had done a very clever thing, and had no fear\nof the consequences until one of his men came running up to the castle\nto announce that Prince Marvel and his companions were approaching to\nrescue the Lady Seseley.\n\n\"How many of them are there?\" demanded the Red Rogue.\n\n\"There are eight, altogether,\" answered the man, \"but two of them are\ngirls.\"\n\n\"And they expect to force me to give up my captives?\" asked the Red\nOne, laughing with a noise like the roar of a waterfall.  \"Why, I shall\nmake prisoners of every one of them!\"\n\nThe man looked at his master fearfully, and replied:\n\n\"This Prince Marvel is very famous, and all people speak of his bravery\nand power.  It was he who conquered King Terribus of Spor, and that\nmighty ruler is now his friend, and is one of the eight who approach.\"\n\nThe Red Rogue stopped laughing, for the fame of Spor's terrible king\nhad long ago reached him.  And he reflected that any one who could\nconquer the army of giants and dwarfs and Gray Men that served Terribus\nmust surely be one to be regarded seriously.  Moreover--and this was a\nsecret--the Red Rogue had never been able to gain the strength to\ncorrespond with his gigantic size, but had ever remained as weak as\nwhen he was a puny boy.  So he was accustomed to rely on his cunning\nand on the terror his very presence usually excited to triumph over his\nenemies.  And he began to be afraid of this prince.\n\n\"You say two of the party are girls?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man, \"but also among them are King Terribus himself,\nand the renowned Wul-Takim, formerly king of thieves, who was conquered\nby the prince, although accounted a hard fighter, and is now his\ndevoted servant.  And there are two old men who are just alike and have\na very fierce look about them.  They are said to come from the hidden\nKingdom of Twi.\"\n\nBy this time the Red Rogue was thoroughly frightened, but he did not\nyet despair of defeating his enemies.  He knew better than to attempt\nto oppose Prince Marvel by force, but he still hoped to conquer him by\ntrickery and deceit.\n\nAmong the wonderful things that the Red Rogue's former master, the wise\nscholar and magician, had made were two large enchanted mirrors, which\nwere set on each side of the great hallway of the castle.  Heavy\ncurtains were drawn over the surfaces of these mirrors, because they\nboth possessed a dreadful magical power.  For whenever any one looked\ninto one of them his reflection was instantly caught and imprisoned in\nthe mirror, and his body at the same time became invisible to all\nearthly eyes, only the mirror retaining his form.\n\nWhile considering a way to prevent the prince from freeing the Lady\nSeseley, the Red Rogue happened to think of these mirrors, which had\nnever yet been used.  So he went stealthily into the great hall and\ndrew aside the covering from one of the mirrors.  He did not dare look\ninto the mirror himself, but hurried away to another room, and then\nsent a page up a back stairway to summon the Lady Seseley and her two\nmaids into his presence.\n\nThe girls at once obeyed, for they greatly feared the Red Rogue; and of\ncourse they descended the front stairway and walked through the great\nhall.  At once the large mirror that had been exposed to view caught\nthe eye of Seseley, and she paused to regard her reflection in the\nglass.  Her two companions did likewise, and instantly all three girls\nbecame invisible, while the mirror held their reflections fast in its\nmagic surface.\n\nThe Red Rogue was watching them through a crack in the door, and seeing\nthe girls disappear he gave a joyful laugh and exclaimed:\n\n\"Now let Prince Marvel find them if he can!\"\n\nThe three girls began to wander aimlessly through the castle; for not\nonly were they invisible to others, but also to themselves and to one\nanother, and they knew not what to do nor which way to turn.\n\n\n\n24.  The Enchanted Mirrors\n\nPresently Prince Marvel and his party arrived and paused before the\ndoors of the castle, where the Red Rogue stood bowing to them with mock\npoliteness and with an evil grin showing on his red face.\n\n\"I come to demand the release of the Lady Seseley and her companions!\"\nPrince Marvel announced, in a bold voice.  \"And I also intend to call\nyou to account for the murder of Baron Merd.\"\n\n\"You must be at the wrong castle,\" answered the Red One, \"for I have\nmurdered no baron, nor have I any Lady Seseley as prisoner.\"\n\n\"Are you not the Red Rogue of Dawna?\" demanded the prince.\n\n\"Men call me by that name,\" acknowledged the other.\n\n\"Then you are deceiving me,\" said the prince.\n\n\"No, indeed!\" answered the Red Rogue, mockingly.  \"I wouldn't deceive\nany one for the world.  But, if you don't believe me, you are welcome\nto search my castle.\"\n\n\"That I shall do,\" returned the prince, sternly, \"whether I have your\npermission or not,\" and he began to dismount.  But Nerle restrained\nhim, saying:\n\n\"Master, I beg you will allow me to search the castle.  For this Red\nRogue is playing some trick upon us, I am sure, and if anything\nhappened to you there would be no one to protect the little High Ki and\nour other friends.\"\n\n\"But suppose something should happen to you?\" inquired the prince,\nanxiously.\n\n\"In that case,\" said Nerle, \"you can avenge me.\"\n\nThe advice was so reasonable, under the circumstances, that the prince\ndecided to act upon it.\n\n\"Very well,\" said he, \"go and search the castle, and I will remain with\nour friends.  But if anything happens to you, I shall call the Red\nRogue to account.\"\n\nSo Nerle entered the castle, passing by the huge form of its owner, who\nonly nodded to the boy and grinned with delight.\n\nThe esquire found himself in the great hall and began to look around\nhim, but without seeing any one.  Then he advanced a few steps and, to\nhis surprise, discovered a large mirror, in which were reflected the\nfaces and forms of three girls, as well as his own.\n\n\"Why, here they are!\" he attempted to say; but he could not hear his\nown voice.  He glanced down at himself but could see nothing at\nall--for his body had become invisible.  His reflection was still in\nthe glass, and he knew that his body existed the same as before; but\nalthough he yet saw plainly the hall and all that it contained, he\ncould see neither himself nor any other person of flesh.\n\nAfter waiting a considerable time for his esquire to reappear Prince\nMarvel became impatient.\n\n\"What have you done with Nerle?\" he asked of the Red Rogue.\n\n\"Nothing,\" was the reply.  \"I have been here, plainly within your\nsight, every moment.\"\n\n\"Let me go and find him!\" exclaimed King Terribus, and rushed into the\ncastle before the prince could reply.  But Terribus also encountered\nthe enchanted mirror, and the prince waited in vain for his return.\n\nThen Wul-Takim volunteered to go in search of the others, and drew his\nbig, sharp sword before entering the hall.  But an hour passed by and\nhe did not return.\n\nThe Red Rogue was overjoyed at the success of his stratagem, and could\nscarce refrain from laughing outright at the prince's anxiety.\n\nMarvel was really perplexed.  He knew some treachery was afoot, but\ncould not imagine what it was.  And when the pretty High Ki declared\ntheir intention of entering the castle, he used every endeavor to\ndissuade them.  But the twin girls would not be denied, so great was\ntheir curiosity.  So the prince said:\n\n\"Well, we will all go together, so that the Ki and I may be able to\nprotect you.\"\n\nThe Red Rogue gladly granted them admittance, and they passed him and\nentered the great hall.\n\nThe place appeared to them to be completely empty, so they walked along\nand came opposite the mirror.  Here all stopped at once, and the twin\nHigh Ki uttered exclamations of surprise, and the twin Ki shouted,\n\"Great Kika-koo!\"\n\nFor there in the glass were the reflections of the three girls and\nNerle and King Terribus and Wul-Takim.  And there were also the\nreflections of the twin High Ki and the twin Ki. Only Prince Marvel's\nreflection was missing, and this was because of his fairy origin.  For\nthe glass could reflect and hold only the forms of mortals.\n\nBut the prince saw the reflections of all the others, and then made the\ndiscovery that the forms of the Ki and the High Ki had become\ninvisible.  No one except himself appeared to be standing in the great\nhall of the Red Rogue's castle!  Yet grouped within the glass were the\nlikenesses of all his friends, as well as those of Lady Seseley and her\ncompanions; and all were staring back at him earnestly, as if imploring\nhim to save them.\n\nThe mystery was now explained, and Prince Marvel rushed from the hall\nto find the treacherous Red Rogue.  But that clever trickster had\nhidden himself in an upper room, and for the present was safely\nconcealed.\n\nFor a time Prince Marvel could not think what to do.  Such magic was\nall unknown to him, and how to free the imprisoned forms of his friends\nwas a real problem.  He walked around the castle, but no one was in\nsight, the Rogue having given orders to all his people to keep away.\nOnly the tethered horses did he see, and these raised their heads and\nwhinnied as if in sympathy with his perplexity.\n\nThen he went back into the hall and searched all the rooms of the\ncastle without finding a single person.  On his return he stopped in\nfront of the mirror and sorrowfully regarded the faces of his friends,\nwho again seemed to plead for relief.\n\nAnd while he looked a sudden fit of anger came over him at being\noutwitted by this Red Rogue of Dawna.  Scarcely knowing what he did, he\nseized his sword by the blade and struck the mirror a powerful blow\nwith the heavy hilt.  It shattered into a thousand fragments, which\nfell clattering upon the stone floor in every direction.  And at once\nthe charm was broken; each of his friends now became visible.  They\nappeared running toward him from all parts of the castle, where they\nhad been wandering in their invisible forms.\n\nThey called out joyful greetings to one another, and then all of them\nsurrounded the prince and thanked him earnestly for releasing them.\n\nThe little Lady Seseley and her friends, Berna and Helda, were a bit\nshy in the presence of so many strangers; but they alone knew the\nprince's secret, and that he was a fairy transformed for a year; so\nthey regarded him as an old and intimate acquaintance, and after being\nintroduced by him to the others of his party they became more at ease.\n\nThe sweet little High Ki maids at once attracted Seseley, and she loved\nthem almost at first sight.  But it was Nerle who became the little\nlady's staunchest friend; for there was something rather mystical and\nunnatural to him about the High Ki, who seemed almost like fairies,\nwhile in Seseley he recognized a hearty, substantial girl of his own\nrank in life.\n\nWhile they stood talking and congratulating one another outside of the\ncastle, the Red Rogue of Dawna appeared among them.  He had heard the\nnoise of the smashing of his great mirror, and had come running\ndownstairs from his hiding-place to find his cunning had all been for\nnaught and his captives were free.\n\nA furious anger then took possession of the Rogue, and forgetting his\npersonal weakness he caught up a huge battle-ax and rushed out to hurl\nhimself upon Prince Marvel, intending to do him serious injury.\n\nBut the prince was not taken unawares.  He saw the Red Rogue coming and\nmet him with drawn sword, striking quickly at the arm that wielded the\nbig ax.  The stroke was as sure as it was quick, and piercing the arm\nof the giant caused him to drop the ax with a howl of pain.\n\nThen Prince Marvel seized the Red Rogue by the ear--which he was just\ntall enough to reach--and dragged him up the steps and into the castle,\nthe big fellow crying for mercy at every step and trembling like a leaf\nthrough cowardice.\n\nBut down the hall Marvel marched him, seeking some room where the Rogue\nmight be safely locked in.  The great curtain that covered the second\nenchanted mirror now caught Prince Marvel's eye, and, still holding his\nprisoner by the ear, he reached out his left hand and pulled aside the\ndrapery.\n\nThe Red Rogue looked to see what his captor was doing, and beheld his\nown reflection in the magic mirror.  Instantly he gave a wild cry and\ndisappeared, his body becoming absolutely invisible, while his coarse\nred countenance stared back from the mirror.\n\nAnd then Prince Marvel gave a sigh of relief and dropped the curtain\nover the surface of the mirror.  For he realized that the Red Rogue of\nDawna had at last met with just punishment and was safely imprisoned\nfor all time.\n\n\n\n25.  The Adventurers Separate\n\nWhen Prince Marvel and his friends had ridden away from the castle the\nsavage followers of the Red One came creeping up to listen for their\nmaster's voice.  But silence reigned in every part of the castle, and\nafter stealing fearfully through the rooms without seeing any one the\nfellows became filled with terror and fled from the place, never to\nreturn.\n\nAnd afterward the neighbors whispered that the castle was haunted by\nthe spirit of the terrible Red Rogue, and travelers dared not stop in\nthe neighborhood, but passed by quickly and with averted faces.\n\nThe prince and his party rode gaily along toward the Kingdom of Heg,\nfor Nerle had invited them all to visit his father's castle.  They were\nvery happy over their escape, and only the little Lady Seseley became\nsad at times, when she thought of her father's sad fate.\n\nThe Baron Neggar, who was Nerle's father, was not only a wealthy\nnobleman, but exceedingly kind and courteous; so that every member of\nPrince Marvel's party was welcomed to the big castle in a very\nhospitable manner.\n\nNerle was eagerly embraced by both his father and mother, who were\noverjoyed to see him return safe and sound after his wanderings and\nadventures.\n\n\"And have you been cured of your longing for something that you can not\nhave?\" asked the baron, anxiously.\n\n\"Not quite,\" said Nerle, laughing; \"but I am more reconciled to my lot.\nFor I find wherever I go people are longing for just the things they\ncan not get, and probably would not want if they had them.  So, as it\nseems to be the fate of most mortals to live unsatisfied, I shall try\nhereafter to be more contented.\"\n\nThese words delighted the good baron, and he gave a rich and\nmagnificent feast in honor of his son's return.\n\nThe High Ki of Twi, after passing several pleasant days at Nerle's\nhome, now decided that they had seen enough of the world and would be\nglad to return to their own kingdom, where all was peaceful and\nuneventful, and rule it to the end of their days.  So the baron\nfurnished them an escort of twenty men-at-arms, and these conducted the\nHigh Ki and the aged Ki safely back to the hole in the hedge.\n\nAnd after they had entered the Land of Twi, the first act of the High\nKi was to order the hedge repaired and the hole blocked up; and I have\nnever heard that any one, from that time forth, ever succeeded in\ngaining admittance to the hidden kingdom.  So its subsequent history is\nunknown.\n\nKing Terribus also bade the prince an affectionate farewell and rode\nback to his own kingdom; and burly Wul-Takim accompanied him as far as\nthe cave, where the fifty-eight reformed thieves awaited him.\n\nNerle's mother gladly adopted the Lady Seseley and her two companions,\nand thereafter they made their home at the baron's castle.  And years\nafterward, when they had grown to be women, Seseley was married to\nNerle and became the lady of the castle herself.\n\nPrince Marvel enjoyed the feasting and dancing at the castle very much,\nbut after the party began to break up, and the High Ki and the Ki had\nleft him, as well as King Terribus and honest Wul-Takim, the young\nknight grew thoughtful and sometimes uneasy, and his happy laugh was\nless frequently heard.  Nerle often regarded his young master with a\nfeeling of awe, for there occasionally came a look into Marvel's eyes\nthat reminded him more of the immortals than of any human being.  But\nthe prince treated him with rare kindness and always pressed Nerle's\nhand affectionately when he bade him good night, for he had grown fond\nof his esquire.  Also they had long conversations together, during\nwhich Nerle gleaned a great deal of knowledge and received some advice\nthat was of much use to him in his later life.\n\nOne day Prince Marvel sought out Lady Seseley and said:\n\n\"Will you ride with me to the Forest of Lurla?\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" she answered; and calling Berna and Helda to attend them,\nthey mounted their horses and rode swiftly away, for it was a long\ndistance to Lurla.\n\nBy noon the party entered the forest, and although the path they\ntraversed was unknown to the girls, who had usually entered the forest\nfrom its other side, near to where the Baron Merd's castle had stood,\nthe prince seemed to have no difficulty in finding his way.\n\nHe guided them carefully along the paths, his handsome war-charger\nstepping with much grace and dignity, until at length they came to a\nclearing.\n\nHere the prince paused abruptly, and Seseley looked around her and at\nonce recognized the place.\n\n\"Why,\" she exclaimed, in surprise, \"it is the Fairy Bower!\"\n\nAnd then she turned to Prince Marvel and asked in a soft voice:\n\n\"Is the year ended, Prince?\"\n\nHis smile was a bit sad as he answered, slowly:\n\n\"The year will be ended in five minutes!\"\n\n\n\n26.  The End of the Year\n\nThe girls sat upon the green moss and waited.  Prince Marvel stood\nsilent beside his horse.  The silver armor was as bright as the day he\ndonned it, nor was there a dent in his untarnished shield.  The sword\nthat had done such good service he held lightly in his hand, and the\nhorse now and then neighed softly and turned to look at him with\naffectionate eyes.\n\nSeseley began to tremble with excitement, and Berna and Helda stared at\nthe prince with big round eyes.\n\nBut, after all, they saw nothing so remarkable as they expected.  For\npresently--and it all happened in a flash--Prince Marvel was gone from\ntheir midst, and a handsome, slender-limbed deer darted from the bower\nand was quickly lost in the thick forest.  On the ground lay a sheet of\nbark and a twig from a tree, and beside them was Lady Seseley's white\nvelvet cloak.\n\nThen the three girls each drew a long breath and looked into one\nanother's eyes, and, while thus engaged, a peal of silvery laughter\nsounded in their ears and made them spring quickly to their feet.\n\nBefore them stood a tiny and very beautiful fairy, clothed in floating\ngossamer robes of rose and pearl color, and with eyes sparkling like\ntwin stars.\n\n\"Prince Marvel!\" exclaimed the three, together.\n\n\"No, indeed!\" cried the fairy, with a pretty little pout.  \"I am no one\nbut myself; and, really, I believe I shall now be content to exist for\na few hundred years in my natural form.  I have quite enjoyed my year\nas a mortal; but after all there are, I find, some advantages in being\na fairy.  Good by, my dears!\"\n\nAnd with another ripple of laughter the pretty creature vanished, and\nthe girls were left alone.\n\n\n\n27.  A Hundred Years Afterward\n\nAbout a hundred years after Prince Marvel enjoyed his strange\nadventures in the Enchanted Island of Yew an odd thing happened.\n\nA hidden mirror in a crumbling old castle of Dawna broke loose from its\nfastenings and fell crashing on the stone pavement of the deserted\nhall.  And from amid the ruins rose the gigantic form of a man.  His\nhair and beard were a fiery red, and he gazed at the desolation around\nhim in absolute amazement.\n\nIt was the Red Rogue of Dawna, set free from his imprisonment.\n\nHe wandered out and found strange scenes confronting him, for during\nthe hundred years a great change had taken place in the Enchanted\nIsland.  Great cities had been built and great kingdoms established.\nCivilization had won the people, and they no longer robbed or fought or\nindulged in magical arts, but were busily employed and leading\nrespectable lives.\n\nWhen the Red Rogue tried to tell folks who he was, they but laughed at\nhim, thinking the fellow crazy.  He tried to get together a band of\nthieves, as Wul-Takim had done in the old days, but none would join him.\n\nAnd so, forced to be honest against his will, the Rogue was driven to\nearn a living by digging in the garden of a wealthy noble, of whom he\nhad never before heard.\n\nBut often he would pause in his labors and lean on his spade, while\nthoughts of the old days of wild adventure passed through his mind in\nrapid succession; and then the big man would shake his red head with a\npuzzled air and mutter:\n\n\"I wonder who that Prince Marvel could have been!  And I wonder what\never became of him!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Enchanted Island of Yew, by L.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
