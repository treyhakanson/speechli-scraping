There is no\nsuch need any longer. The tales, so far as they went, I gather\ntogether here for the few that seem to read my books in England.\n\n                                                            Dunsany.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Dirge Of Victory (Sonnet)\n\nLift not thy trumpet, Victory, to the sky,\n  Nor through battalions nor by batteries blow,\n  But over hollows full of old wire go,\nWhere among dregs of war the long-dead lie\nWith wasted iron that the guns passed by.\n  When they went eastwards like a tide at flow;\n  There blow thy trumpet that the dead may know,\nWho waited for thy coming, Victory.\n\nIt is not we that have deserved thy wreath,\n  They waited there among the towering weeds.\nThe deep mud burned under the thermite's breath,\n  And winter cracked the bones that no man heeds:\nHundreds of nights flamed by: the seasons passed.\nAnd thou last come to them at last, at last!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cathedral Of Arras\n\nOn the great steps of Arras Cathedral I saw a procession, in silence,\nstanding still.\n\nThey were in orderly and perfect lines, stirring or swaying slightly:\nsometimes they bent their heads, sometimes two leaned together, but\nfor the most part they were motionless. It was the time when the\nfashion is just changing and some were newly all in shining yellow,\nwhile others still wore green.\n\nI went up the steps amongst them, the only human thing, for men and\nwomen worship no more in Arras Cathedral, and the trees have come\ninstead; little humble things, all less than four years old, in great\nnumbers thronging the steps processionally, and growing in perfect\nrows just where step meets step. They have come to Arras with the\nwind and the rain; which enter the aisles together whenever they\nwill, and go wherever man went; they have such a reverent air, the\nyoung limes on the three flights of steps, that you would say they\ndid not know that Arras Cathedral was fallen on evil days, that they\ndid not know they looked on ruin and vast disaster, but thought that\nthese great walls open to stars and sun were the natural and fitting\nplace for the worship of little weeds.\n\nBehind them the shattered houses of Arras seemed to cluster about the\ncathedral as, one might fancy easily, hurt and frightened children,\nso wistful are their gaping windows and old, grey empty gables, so\nmelancholy and puzzled. They are more like a little old people come\nupon trouble, gazing at their great elder companion and not knowing\nwhat to do.\n\nBut the facts of Arras are sadder than a poet's most tragic fancies.\nIn the western front of Arras Cathedral stand eight pillars rising\nfrom the ground; above them stood four more. Of the four upper\npillars the two on the left are gone, swept away by shells from the\nnorth: and a shell has passed through the neck of one of the two that\nis left, just as a bullet might go through a daffodil's stem.\n\nThe left-hand corner of that western wall has been caught from the\nnorth, by some tremendous shell which has torn the whole corner down\nin a mound of stone: and still the walls have stood.\n\nI went in through the western doorway. All along the nave lay a long\nheap of white stones, with grass and weeds on the top, and a little\ntrodden path over the grass and weeds. This is all that remained of\nthe roof of Arras Cathedral and of any chairs or pews there may have\nbeen in the nave, or anything that may have hung above them. It was\nall down but one slender arch that crossed the nave just at the\ntransept; it stood out against the sky, and all who saw it wondered\nhow it stood.\n\nIn the southern aisle panes of green glass, in twisted frame of lead,\nhere and there lingered, like lonely leaves on an apple-tree-after a\nhailstorm in spring. The aisles still had their roofs over them which\nthose stout old walls held up in spite of all.\n\nWhere the nave joins the transept the ruin is most enormous. Perhaps\nthere was more to bring down there, so the Germans brought it down:\nthere may have been a tower there, for all I know, or a spire.\n\nI stood on the heap and looked towards the altar. To my left all was\nruin. To my right two old saints in stone stood by the southern door.\nThe door had been forced open long ago, and stood as it was opened,\npartly broken. A great round hole gaped in the ground outside; it was\nthis that had opened the door.\n\nJust beyond the big heap, on the left of the chancel, stood something\nmade of wood, which almost certainly had been the organ.\n\nAs I looked at these things there passed through the desolate\nsanctuaries, and down an aisle past pillars pitted with shrapnel, a\nsad old woman, sad even for a woman of North-East France. She seemed\nto be looking after the mounds and stones that had once been the\ncathedral; perhaps she had once been the Bishop's servant, or the\nwife of one of the vergers; she only remained of all who had been\nthere in other days, she and the pigeons and jackdaws. I spoke to\nher. All Arras, she said, was ruined. The great cathedral was ruined,\nher own family were ruined utterly, and she pointed to where the sad\nhouses gazed from forlorn dead windows. Absolute ruin, she said; but\nthere must be no armistice. No armistice. No. It was necessary that\nthere should be no armistice at all. No armistice with Germans.\n\nShe passed on, resolute and sad, and the guns boomed on beyond Arras.\n\nA French interpreter, with the Sphinxes' heads on his collar, showed\nme a picture postcard with a photograph of the chancel as it was five\nyears ago. It was the very chancel before which I was standing. To\nsee that photograph astonished me, and to know that the camera that\ntook it must have stood where I was standing, only a little lower\ndown, under the great heap. Though one knew there had been an altar\nthere, and candles and roof and carpet, and all the solemnity of a\ncathedral's interior, yet to see that photograph and to stand on that\nweedy heap, in the wind, under the jackdaws, was a contrast with\nwhich the mind fumbled.\n\nI walked a little with the French interpreter. We came to a little\nshrine in the southern aisle. It had been all paved with marble, and\nthe marble was broken into hundreds of pieces, and someone had\ncarefully picked up all the bits, and laid them together on the\naltar.\n\nAnd this pathetic heap that was gathered of broken bits had drawn\nmany to stop and gaze at it; and idly, as soldiers will, they had\nwritten their names on them: every bit had a name on it, with but a\ntouch of irony the Frenchman said, \"All that is necessary to bring\nyour name to posterity is to write it on one of these stones.\", \"No,\"\nI said, \"I will do it by describing all this.\" And we both laughed.\n\nI have not done it yet: there is more to say of Arras. As I begin the\ntale of ruin and wrong, the man who did it totters. His gaudy power\nbegins to stream away like the leaves of autumn. Soon his throne will\nbe bare, and I shall have but begun to say what I have to say of\ncalamity in cathedral and little gardens of Arras.\n\nThe winter of the Hohenzollerns will come; sceptre, uniforms, stars\nand courtiers all gone; still the world will not know half of the\nbitter wrongs of Arras. And spring will bring a new time and cover\nthe trenches with green, and the pigeons will preen themselves on the\nshattered towers, and the lime-trees along the steps will grow taller\nand brighter, and happier men will sing in the streets untroubled by\nany War Lord; by then, perhaps, I may have told, to such as care to\nread, what such a war did in an ancient town, already romantic when\nromance was young, when war came suddenly without mercy, without\npity, out of the north and east, on little houses, carved galleries,\nand gardens; churches, cathedrals and the jackdaws' nests.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Good War\n\nNietsche said, \"You have heard that a good cause justifies any war,\nbut I say unto you that a good war justifies any cause.\"\n\nA man was walking alone over a plain so desolate that, if you have\nnever seen it, the mere word desolation could never convey to you the\nmelancholy surroundings that mourned about this man on his lonely\nwalk. Far off a vista of trees followed a cheerless road all dead as\nmourners suddenly stricken dead in some funereal procession. By this\nroad he had come; but when he had reached a certain point he turned\nfrom the road at once, branching away to the left, led by a line of\nbushes that may once have been a lane. For some while his feet had\nrustled through long neglected grass; sometimes he lifted them up to\nstep over a telephone wire that lolled over old entanglements and\nbushes; often he came to rusty strands of barbed wire and walked\nthrough them where they had been cut, perhaps years ago, by huge\nshells; then his feet hissed on through the grass again, dead grass\nthat had hissed about his boots all through the afternoon.\n\nOnce he sat down to rest on the edge of a crater, weary with such\nwalking as he had never seen before; and after he had stayed there a\nlittle while a cat that seemed to have its home in that wild place\nstarted suddenly up and leaped away over the weeds. It seemed an\nanimal totally wild, and utterly afraid of man.\n\nGrey bare hills surrounded the waste: a partridge called far off:\nevening was drawing in. He rose wearily, and yet with a certain\nfervour, as one that pursues With devotion a lamentable quest.\nLooking round him as he left his resting-place he saw a cabbage or\ntwo that after some while had come back to what was a field and had\nsprouted on the edge of a shell-hole. A yellowing convolvulus climbed\nup a dead weed. Weeds, grass and tumbled earth were all about him. It\nwould be no better when he went on. Still he went on. A flower or two\npeeped up among the weeds. He stood up and looked at the landscape\nand drew no hope from that, the shattered trunk of a stricken tree\nleered near him, white trenches scarred the hillside. He followed an\nold trench through a hedge of elder, passed under more wire, by a\ngreat rusty shell that had not burst, passed by a dug-out where\nsomething grey seemed to lie down at the bottom of many steps. Black\nfungi grew near the entrance. He went on and on over shell-holes,\npassing round them where they were deep, stepping into or over the\nsmall ones. Little burrs clutched at him; he went rustling on, the\nonly sound in the waste but the clicking of shattered iron. Now he\nwas among nettles. He came by many small unnatural valleys. He passed\nmore trenches only guarded by fungi. While it was light he followed\nlittle paths, marvelling who made them. Once he got into a trench.\nDandelions leaned across it as though to bar his way, believing man\nto have gone and to have no right to return. Weeds thronged, in\nthousands here. It was the day of the weeds. It was only they that\nseemed to triumph in those fields deserted of man. He passed on down\nthe trench and never knew whose trench it once had been. Frightful\nshells had smashed it here and there, and had twisted iron as though\nround gigantic fingers that had twiddled it idly a moment and let it\ndrop to lie in the rain for ever. He passed more dug-outs and black\nfungi, watching them; and then he left the trench, going straight on\nover the open: again dead grasses hissed about his feet, sometimes\nsmall wire sang faintly He passed through a belt of nettles and\nthence to dead grass again. And now the light of the afternoon was\nbeginning to dwindle away. He had intended to reach his journey's end\nby daylight, for he was past the time of life when one wanders after\ndark, but he had not contemplated the difficulty of walking over that\nroad, or dreamed that lanes he knew could be so foundered and merged,\nin that mournful desolate moor.\n\nEvening was filling fast, still he kept on. It was the time when the\ncornstacks would once have begun to grow indistinct, and slowly turn\ngrey in the greyness, and homesteads one by one would have lit their\ninnumerable lights. But evening now came down on a dreary desolation:\nand a cold wind arose; and the traveller heard the mournful sound of\niron flapping on broken things, and knew that this was the sound that\nwould haunt the waste for ever.\n\nAnd evening settled down, a huge grey canvas waiting for sombre\npictures; a setting for all the dark tales of the world, haunted\nforever a grizzly place was haunted ever, in any century, in any\nland; but not by mere ghosts from all those thousands of graves and\nhalf-buried bodies and sepulchral shell-holes; haunted by things\nhuger and more disastrous than that; haunted by wailing ambitions,\nunder the stars or moon, drifting across the rubbish that once was\nvillages, which strews the lonely plain; the lost ambitions of two\nEmperors and a Sultan wailing from wind to wind and whimpering for\ndominion of the world.\n\nThe cold wind blew over the blasted heath and bits of broken iron\nflapped on and on.\n\nAnd now the traveller hurried, for night was falling, and such a\nnight as three witches might have brewed in a cauldron. He went on\neagerly but with infinite sadness. Over the sky-line strange rockets\nwent up from the war, peered oddly over the earth and went down\nagain. Very far off a few soldiers lit a little fire of their own.\nThe night grew colder; tap, tap, went broken iron.\n\nAnd at last the traveller stopped in the lonely night and looked\nround him attentively, and appeared to be satisfied that he had come\nwithin sight of his journey's end, although to ordinary eyes the spot\nto which he had come differed in no way from the rest of the waste.\n\nHe went no further, but turned round and round, peering piece by\npiece at that weedy and cratered earth.\n\nHe was looking for the village where he was born.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House With Two Storeys\n\nI came again to Croisilles.\n\nI looked for the sunken road that we used to hold in support, with\nits row of little shelters in the bank and the carved oak saints\nabove them here and there that had survived the church in Croisilles.\nI could have found it with my eyes shut. With my eyes open I could\nnot find it. I did not recognize the lonely metalled road down which\nlorries were rushing for the little lane so full of life, whose\nwheel-ruts were three years old.\n\nAs I gazed about me looking for our line, I passed an old French\ncivilian looking down at a slight mound of white stone that rose a\nlittle higher than the road. He was walking about uncertainly, when\nfirst I noticed him, as though he was not sure where he was. But now\nhe stood quite still looking down at the mound.\n\n\"Voil\u00e0 ma maison,\" he said.\n\nHe said no more than that: this astounding remark, this gesture that\nindicated such calamity, were quite simply made. There was nothing\nwhatever of theatrical pose that we wrongly associate with the\nFrench, because they conceal their emotions less secretly than we;\nthere were no tragic tones in his voice: only a trace of deep\naffection showed in one of the words he used. He spoke as a woman\nmight say of her only child, \"Look at _my_ baby.\"\n\n\"Voil\u00e0 ma maison,\" he said.\n\nI tried to say in his language what I felt; and after my attempt he\nspoke of his house.\n\nIt was very old. Down underneath, he said, it dated from feudal\ntimes; though I did not quite make out whether all that lay under\nthat mound had been so old or whether he only meant the cellars of\nhis house. It was a fine high house, he said, as much as two storeys\nhigh. No one that is familiar with houses of fifty storeys, none even\nthat has known palaces, will smile at this old man's efforts to tell\nof his high house, and to make me believe that it rose to two storeys\nhigh, as we stood together by that sad white mound. He told me that\nhis son was killed. And that disaster strangely did not move me so\nmuch as the white mound that had been a house and had had two\nstoreys, for it seems to be common to every French family with whose\nfathers I have chanced to speak in ruined cities or on busy roads of\nFrance.\n\nHe pointed to a huge white mound beyond on the top of which someone\nhad stuck a small cross of wood. \"The church,\" he said. And that I\nknew already.\n\nIn very inadequate French I tried to comfort him. I told him that\nsurely France would build his house again. Perhaps even the allies;\nfor I could not believe that we shall have done enough if we merely\ndrive the Germans out of France and leave this poor old man still\nwandering homeless. I told him that surely in the future Croisilles\nwould stand again.\n\nHe took no interest in anything that I said. His house of two storeys\nwas down, his son was dead, the little village of Croisilles had gone\naway; he had only one hope from the future. When I had finished\nspeaking of the future, he raised a knobbed stick that he carried, up\nto the level of his throat, surely his son's old trench stick, and\nthere he let it dangle from a piece of string in the handle, which he\nheld against his neck. He watched me shrewdly and attentively\nmeanwhile, for I was a stranger and was to be taught something I\nmight not know--a thing that it was necessary for all men to learn.\n\"Le Kaiser,\" he said. \"Yes;\" I said, \"the Kaiser.\" But I pronounced\nthe word Kaiser differently from him, and he repeated again \"Le\nKaiser,\" and watched me closely to be sure that I understood. And\nthen he said \"Pendu,\" and made the stick quiver a little as it\ndangled from its string. \"Oui,\" I said, \"Pendu.\"\n\nDid I understand? He was not yet quite sure. It was important that\nthis thing should be quite decided between us as we stood on this\nroad through what had been Croisilles, where he had lived through\nmany sunny years and I had dwelt for a season amongst rats. \"Pendu\"\nhe said. Yes, I agreed.\n\nIt was all right. The old man almost smiled.\n\nI offered him a cigarette and we lit two from an apparatus of flint\nand steel and petrol that the old man had in his pocket.\n\nHe showed me a photograph of himself and a passport to prove, I\nsuppose, that he was not a spy. One could not recognize the likeness,\nfor it must have been taken on some happier day, before he had seen\nhis house of two storeys lying there by the road. But he was no spy,\nfor there were tears in his eyes; and Prussians I think have no tears\nfor what we saw across the village of Croisilles.\n\nI spoke of the rebuilding of his house no more, I spoke no more of\nthe new Croisilles shining through future years; for these were not\nthe things that he saw in the future, and these were not the hopes of\nthe poor old man. He had one dark hope of the future, and no others.\nHe hoped to see the Kaiser hung for the wrong he had done to\nCroisilles. It was for this hope he lived.\n\nMadame or se\u00f1or of whatever far country, who may chance to see these\nwords, blame not this old man for the fierce hope he cherished. It\nwas the only hope he had. You, Madame, with your garden, your house,\nyour church, the village where all know you, you may hope as a\nChristian should, there is wide room for hope in your future. You\nshall see the seasons move over your garden, you shall busy yourself\nwith your home, and speak and share with your neighbours innumerable\nsmall joys, and find consolation and beauty, and at last rest, in and\naround the church whose spire you see from your home. You, se\u00f1or,\nwith your son perhaps growing up, perhaps wearing already some sword\nthat you wore once, you can turn back to your memories or look with\nhope to the future with equal ease.\n\nThe man that I met in Croisilles had none of these things at all. He\nhad that one hope only.\n\nDo not, I pray you, by your voice or vote, or by any power or\ninfluence that you have, do anything to take away from this poor old\nFrenchman the only little hope he has left. The more trivial his odd\nhope appears to you compared with your own high hopes that come so\neasily to you amongst all your fields and houses, the more cruel a\nthing must it be to take it from him.\n\nI learned many things in Croisilles, and the last of them is this\nstrange one the old man taught me. I turned and shook hands with him\nand said good-bye, for I wished to see again our old front line that\nwe used to hold over the hill, now empty, silent at last. \"The Boche\nis defeated,\" I said.\n\n\"Vaincu, vaincu,\" he repeated. And I left him with something almost\nlike happiness looking out of his tearful eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBermondsey _versus_ Wurtemburg\n\nThe trees grew thinner and thinner along the road, then ceased\naltogether, and suddenly we saw Albert in the wood of the ghosts of\nmurdered trees, all grey and deserted.\n\nDescending into Albert past trees in their agony we came all at once\non the houses. You did not see them far off as in other cities; we\ncame on them all at once as you come on a corpse in the grass.\n\nWe stopped and stood by a house that was covered with plaster marked\noff to look like great stones, its pitiful pretence laid bare, the\nslates gone and the rooms gone, the plaster all pitted with shrapnel.\nNear it lay an iron railing, a hand-rail blown there from the railway\nbridge; a shrapnel bullet had passed through its twisted stem as\nthough it had gone through butter. And beside the hand-rail lay one\nof the great steel supports of the bridge that had floated there upon\nsome flaming draught; the end of it bent and splayed as though it had\nbeen a slender cane that someone had shoved too hard into the earth.\n\nThere had been a force abroad in Albert that could do these things,\nan iron force that had no mercy for iron, a mighty mechanical\ncontrivance that could take machinery and pull it all to pieces in a\nmoment as a child takes a flower to pieces petal by petal.\n\nWhen such a force was abroad what chance had man? It had come down\nupon Albert suddenly, and railway lines and bridges had drooped and\nwithered and the houses had stooped down in the blasting heat, and in\nthat attitude I found them still, worn-out, melancholy heaps overcome\nby disaster.\n\nPieces of paper rustled about like footsteps, dirt covered the ruins,\nfragments of rusty shells lay as unsightly and dirty as that which\nthey had destroyed. Cleaned up and polished, and priced at half a\ncrown apiece, these fragments may look romantic some day in a London\nshop, but to-day in Albert they look unclean and untidy, like a cheap\nknife sticking up from a murdered woman's ribs, whose dress is long\nout of fashion.\n\nThe stale smell of war arose from the desolation.\n\nA British helmet dinted in like an old bowler, but tragic not absurd,\nlay near a barrel and a teapot.\n\nOn a wall that rose above a heap of dirty and smashed rafters was\nwritten in red paint KOMPe I.M.B.K. 184. The red paint had dripped\ndown the wall from every letter. Verily we stood upon the scene of\nthe murder.\n\nOpposite those red letters across the road was a house with traces of\na pleasant ornament below the sills of the windows, a design of\ngrapes and vine. Someone had stuck up a wooden boot on a peg outside\nthe door.\n\nPerhaps the cheery design on the wall attracted me. I entered the\nhouse and looked round.\n\nA chunk of shell lay on the floor, and a little decanter, only\nchipped at the lip, and part of a haversack of horse-skin. There were\npretty tiles on the floor, but dry mud buried them deep: it was like\nthe age-old dirt that gathers in temples in Africa. A man's waistcoat\nlay on the mud and part of a woman's stays: the waistcoat was black\nand was probably kept for Sundays. That was all that there was to see\non the ground floor, no more flotsam than that had come down to these\ndays from peace.\n\nA forlorn stairway tried still to wind upstairs. It went up out of a\ncorner of the room. It seemed still to believe that there was an\nupper storey, still to feel that this was a house, there seemed a\nhope in the twists of that battered staircase that men would yet come\nagain and seek sleep at evening by way of those broken steps; the\nhand-rail and the banisters streamed down from the top, a woman's\ndress lolled down from the upper room above those aimless steps, the\nlaths of the ceiling gaped, the plaster was gone; of all the hopes\nmen hope that can never be fulfilled, of all desires that ever come\ntoo late, most futile was the hope expressed by that stairway's\nposture that ever a family would come home there again or tread those\nsteps once more. And, if in some far country one should hope, who has\nnot seen Albert, out of compassion for these poor people of France,\nthat where a staircase still remains there may be enough of a house\nto shelter those who called it home again, I will tell one thing\nmore: there blew inside that house the same wind that blew outside,\nthe wind that wandered free over miles of plains wandered unchecked\nthrough that house; there was no indoors or outdoors any more.\n\nAnd on the wall of the room in which I stood, someone had proudly\nwritten his regiment's name, The 156th Wurtemburgers. It was written\nin chalk; and another man had come and had written two words before\nit and had recorded the name of his own regiment too. And the writing\nremains after these two men are gone, and the lonely house is silent\nbut for the wind and the things that creak as it blows, the only\nmessage of this deserted house, is this mighty record, this rare line\nof history, ill-written: \"Lost by the 156th Wurtemburgers, retaken by\nthe Bermondsey Butterflies.\"\n\nTwo men wrote that sentence between them. And, as with Homer, no one\nknows who they were. And; like Homer, their words were epic.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn An Old Battle-Field\n\nI entered an old battle-field through a garden gate, a pale green\ngate by the. Bapaume-Arras road. The cheerful green attracted me in\nthe deeps of the desolation as an emerald might in a dust-bin. I\nentered through that homely garden gate, it had no hinges, no\npillars, it lolled on a heap of stone: I came to it from the road;\nthis alone was not battle-field; the road alone was made and tended\nand kept; all the rest was battle-field, as far as the eye could see.\nOver a large whitish heap lay a Virginia creeper, turning a dull\ncrimson. And the presence of this creeper mourning there in the waste\nshowed unmistakably that the heap had been a house. All the living\nthings were gone that had called this white heap Home: the father\nwould be fighting, somewhere; the children would have fled, if there\nhad been time; the dog would have gone with them, or perhaps, if\nthere was not time, he served other masters; the cat would have made\na lair for herself and stalked mice at night through the trenches.\nAll the live things that we ever consider were gone; the creeper\nalone remained, the only mourner, clinging to fallen stones that had\nsupported it once.\n\nAnd I knew by its presence here there had been a house. And by the\ntexture or composition of the ruin all round I saw that a village had\nstood there. There are calamities one does not contemplate, when one\nthinks of time and change. Death, passing away, even ruin, are all\nthe human lot; but one contemplates ruin as brought by kindly ages,\ncoming slowly at last, with lichen and ivy and moss, its harsher\naspects all hidden with green, coming with dignity and in due season.\nThus our works should pass away; our worst fears contemplated no more\nthan this.\n\nBut here in a single day, perhaps in a moment with one discharge from\na battery, all the little things that one family cared for, their\nhouse, their garden; and the garden paths, and then the village and\nthe road through the village, and the old landmarks that the old\npeople remembered, and countless treasured things, were all turned\ninto rubbish.\n\nAnd these things that one did not contemplate, have happened for\nhundreds of miles, with such disaster vast plains and hills are\ncovered, because of the German war.\n\nDeep wells, old cellars, battered trenches and dug-outs, lie in the\nrubbish and weeds under the intricate wreckage of peace and war. It\nwill be a bad place years hence for wanderers lost at night.\n\nWhen the village went, trenches came; and, in the same storm that had\ncrumbled the village, the trenches withered too; shells still thump\non to the north, but peace and war alike have deserted the village.\nGrass has begun to return over torn earth on edges of trenches.\nAbundant wire rusts away by its twisted stakes of steel. Not a path\nof old, not a lane nor a doorway there, but is barred and cut off by\nwire; and the wire in its turn has been cut by shells and lies in\nungathered swathes. A pair of wheels moulders amongst weeds, and may\nbe of peace or of war, it is too broken down for anyone to say. A\ngreat bar of iron lies cracked across as though one of the elder\ngiants had handled it carelessly. Another mound near by, with an old\ngreen beam sticking out of it, was also once a house. A trench runs\nby it. A German bomb with its wooden handle, some bottles, a bucket,\na petrol tin and some bricks and stones, lie in the trench. A young\nelder tree grows amongst them. And over all the ruin and rubbish\nNature, with all her wealth and luxury, comes back to her old\ninheritance, holding again the land that she held so long, before the\nhouses came.\n\nA garden gate of iron has been flung across a wall. Then a deep\ncellar into which a whole house seems to have slanted down. In the\nmidst of all this is an orchard. A huge shell has uprooted, but not\nkilled, an apple-tree; another apple-tree stands stone dead on the\nedge of a crater: most of the trees are dead. British aeroplanes\ndrone over continually. A great gun goes by towards Bapaume, dragged\nby a slow engine with caterpillar wheels. The gun is all blotched\ngreen and yellow. Four or five men are seated on the huge barrel\nalone.\n\nDark old steps near the orchard run down into a dug-out, with a\ncartridge-case tied to a piece of wood beside it to beat when the gas\ncame. A telephone wire lies listlessly by the opening. A patch of\nMichaelmas daisies, deep mauve and pale mauve, and a bright yellow\nflower beside them, show where a garden used to stand near by. Above\nthe dug-out a patch of jagged earth shows in three clear layers under\nthe weeds: four inches of grey road metal, imported, for all this\ncountry is chalk and clay; two inches of flint below it, and under\nthat an inch of a bright red stone. We are looking then at a road--a\nroad through a village trodden by men and women, and the hooves of\nhorses and familiar modern things, a road so buried, so shattered, so\novergrown, showing by chance an edge in the midst of the wilderness,\nthat I could seem rather to have discovered the track of the Dinosaur\nin prehistoric clays than the highway, of a little village that only\nfive years ago was full of human faults and joys and songs and tiny\ntears. Down that road before the plans, of the Kaiser began to fumble\nwith the earth, down that road--but it is useless to look back, we\nare too far away from five years ago, too far away from thousands of\nordinary things, that never seemed as though they would ever peer at\nus over chasms of time, out of another age, utterly far off,\nirrevocably removed from our ways and days. They are gone, those\ntimes, gone like the Dinosaur; gone with bows and arrows and the old\nknightlier days. No splendour marks their sunset where I sit, no\ndignity of houses, or derelict engines of war, mined all equally are\nscattered dirtily in the mud, and common weeds overpower them; it is\nnot ruin but rubbish that covers the ground here and spreads its\nuntidy flood for hundreds and hundreds of miles.\n\nA band plays in Arras, to the north and east the shells go thumping\non.\n\nThe very origins of things are in doubt, so much is jumbled together.\nIt is as hard to make out just where the trenches ran, and which was\nNo-Man's-Land, as it is to tell the houses from garden and orchard\nand road: the rubbish covers all. It is as though the ancient forces\nof Chaos had come back from the abyss to fight against order and man,\nand Chaos had won. So lies this village of France.\n\nAs I left it a rat, with something in its mouth, holding its head\nhigh, ran right across the village.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Real Thing\n\nOnce at manoeuvres as the Prussian Crown Prince charged at the head\nof his regiment, as sabres gleamed, plumes streamed, and hooves\nthundered behind him, he is reported to have said to one that\ngalloped near him: \"Ah, if only this were the real thing!\"\n\nOne need not doubt that the report is true. So a young man might feel\nas he led his regiment of cavalry, for the scene would fire the\nblood; all those young men and fine uniforms and good horses, all\ncoming on behind, everything streaming that could float on the air,\neverything jingling then which could ever make a sound, a bright sky\nno doubt over the uniforms, a good fresh wind for men and horses to\ngulp; and behind, the clinking and jingling, the long roll of hooves\nthundering. Such a scene might well stir emotions to sigh for the\nsplendours of battle.\n\nThis is one side of war. Mutilation and death are another; misery,\ncold and dirt; pain, and the intense loneliness of men left behind by\narmies, with much to think of; no hope, and a day or two to live. But\nwe understand that glory covers that.\n\nThere is yet a third side.\n\nI came to Albert when the fight was far from it: only at night you\nsaw any signs of war, when clouds flashed now and then and curious\nrockets peered. Albert robbed of peace was deserted even by war.\n\nI will not say that Albert was devastated or desolate, for these long\nwords have different interpretations and may easily be exaggerated. A\nGerman agent might say to you, \"Devastated is rather a strong word,\nand desolate is a matter of opinion.\" And so you might never know\nwhat Albert is like.\n\nI will tell you what I saw.\n\nAlbert was a large town. I will not write of all of it.\n\nI sat down near a railway bridge at the edge of the town; I think I\nwas near the station; and small houses had stood there with little\ngardens; such as porters and other railway folk would have lived in.\nI sat down on the railway and looked at one of these houses, for it\nhad clearly been a house. It was at the back of it that most\nremained, in what must have been a garden. A girder torn up like a\npack of cards lay on the leg of a table amongst a brick wall by an\napple-tree.\n\nLower down in the heap was the frame-work of a large four-poster bed;\nthrough it all a vine came up quite green and still alive; and at the\nedge of the heap lay a doll's green pram. Small though the house had\nbeen there was evidence in that heap of some prosperity in more than\none generation. For the four-poster bed had been a fine one, good\nwork in sound old timber, before the bits in the girder had driven it\ninto the wall; and the green pram must have been the dowry of no\nordinary, doll, but one with the best yellow curls whose blue eyes\ncould move. One blue columbine close by mourned alone for the garden.\n\nThe wall and the vine and the bed and the girder lay in an orchard,\nand some of the apple-trees were standing yet, though the orchard had\nbeen terribly wrecked by shell fire. All that still stood were dead.\nSome stood upon the very edge of craters; their leaves and twigs and\nbark had been stripped by one blast in a moment; and they had\ntottered, with stunted, black, gesticulating branches; and so they\nstood today.\n\nThe curls of a mattress lay on the ground, clipped once from a\nhorse's mane.\n\nAfter looking for some while across the orchard one suddenly noticed\nthat the cathedral had stood on the other side. It was draped, when\nwe saw it closer, as with a huge grey cloak, the lead of its roof\nhaving come down and covered it.\n\nNear the house of that petted doll (as I came to think of it) a road\nran by on the other side of the railway. Great shells had dropped\nalong it with terrible regularity. You could imagine Death striding\ndown it with exact five-yard paces, on his own day, claiming his own.\nAs I stood on the road something whispered behind me; and I saw,\nstirring round with the wind, in one of those footsteps of Death, a\ndouble page of a book open at Chapter II: and Chapter II was headed\nwith the proverb, \"Un Malheur Ne Vient Jamais Seul;\" Misfortunes\nnever come singly! And on that dreadful road, with shell-holes every\nfive yards as far as the eye could see, and fiat beyond it the whole\ncity in ruin. What harmless girl or old man had been reading that\ndreadful prophecy when the Germans came down upon Albert and involved\nit, and themselves, and that book, all except those two pages, in\nsuch multiplication of ruin?\n\nSurely, indeed, there is a third side to war: for what had the doll\ndone, that used to have a green pram, to deserve to share thus in the\nfall and punishment of an Emperor?\n\n\n\n\n\nA Garden Of Arras\n\nAs I walked through Arras from the Spanish gate, gardens flashed as I\nwent, one by one, through the houses.\n\nI stepped in over the window-sill of one of the houses, attracted by\nthe gleam of a garden dimly beyond: and went through the empty house,\nempty of people, empty of furniture, empty of plaster, and entered\nthe garden through an empty doorway.\n\nWhen I came near it seemed less like a garden. At first it had almost\nseemed to beckon to passers-by in the street, so rare are gardens now\nin this part of France, that it seemed to have more than a garden's\nshare of mystery, all in the silence there at the back of the silent\nhouse; but when one entered it some of the mystery went, and seemed\nto hide in a further part of the garden amongst wild shrubs and\ninnumerable weeds.\n\nBritish aeroplanes frequently roared over, disturbing the\ncongregation of Arras Cathedral a few hundred yards away, who rose\ncawing and wheeled over the garden; for only jackdaws come to Arras\nCathedral now, besides a few pigeons.\n\nUnkempt beside me a bamboo flourished wildly, having no need of man.\nOn the other side of the small wild track that had been the garden\npath the skeletons of hothouses stood, surrounded by nettles; their\npipes lay all about, shattered and riddled through.\n\nBranches of rose break up through the myriad nettles, but only to be\nseized and choked by columbine. A late moth looks for flowers not\nquite in vain. It hovers on wing-beats that are invisibly swift by\nits lonely autumn flower, then darts away over the desolation which\nis no desolation to a moth: man has destroyed man; nature comes back;\nit is well: that must be the brief philosophy of myriads of tiny\nthings whose way of life one seldom considered before; now that man's\ncities are down, now that ruin and misery confront us whichever way\nwe turn, one notices more the small things that are left.\n\nOne of the greenhouses is almost all gone, a tumbled mass that might\nbe a piece of Babylon, if arch\u00e6ologists should come to study it. But\nit is too sad to study, too untidy to have any interest, and, alas,\ntoo common: there are hundreds of miles of this.\n\nThe other greenhouse, a sad, ungainly skeleton, is possessed by grass\nand weeds. On the raised centre many flower-pots were neatly arranged\nonce: they stand in orderly lines, but each separate one is broken:\nnone contain flowers any more, but only grass. And the glass of the\ngreenhouse lies there in showers, all grey. No one has tidied\nanything up there for years.\n\nA meadow-sweet had come into that greenhouse and dwelt there in that\nabode of fine tropical flowers, and one night an elder tree had\nentered and is now as high as the house, and at the end of the\ngreenhouse grass has come in like a wave; for change and disaster are\nfar-reaching and are only mirrored here. This desolate garden and its\nmined house are a part of hundreds of thousands such, or millions.\nMathematics will give you no picture of what France has suffered. If\nI tell you what one garden is like, one village, one house, one\ncathedral, after the German war has swept by, and if you read my\nwords, I may help you perhaps to imagine more easily what France has\nsuffered than if I spoke of millions. I speak of one garden in Arras;\nand you might walk from there, south by east for weeks, and find no\ngarden that has suffered less.\n\nIt is all weeds and elders. An apple-tree rises out of a mass of\nnettles, but it is quite dead. Wild rose-trees show here and there,\nor roses that have ran wild like the cats of No-Man's-Land: And once\nI saw a rose-bush that had been planted in a pot and still grew\nthere, as though it still remembered man, but the flower-pot was\nshattered, like all the pots in that garden, and the rose grew wild\nas any in any hedge.\n\nThe ivy alone grows on over a mighty wall, and seems to care not. The\nivy alone seems not to mourn, but to have added the last four years\nto its growth as though they were ordinary years. That corner of the\nwall alone whispers not of disaster, it only seems to tell of the\npassing of years, which makes the ivy strong, and for which in peace\nas in war there is no cure. All the rest speaks of war, of war that\ncomes to gardens, without banners or trumpets or splendour, and roots\nup everything, and turns round and smashes the house, and leaves it\nall desolate, and forgets and goes away. And when the histories of\nthe war are written, attacks and counter-attacks and the doom of\nEmperors, who will remember that garden?\n\nSaddest of all, as it seemed to me watching the garden paths, were\nspiders' webs that had been spun across them, so grey and stout and\nstrong, fastened from weed to weed, with the spiders in their midst\nsitting in obvious ownership. You knew then as you looked at those\nwebs across all the paths in the garden that any that you might fancy\nwalking the small paths still, were but grey ghosts gone from thence,\nno more than dreams, hopes and imaginings, something altogether\nweaker than spiders webs.\n\nAnd the old wall of the garden that divides it from its neighbour, of\nsolid stone and brick, over fifteen feet high, it is that mighty old\nwall that held the romance of the garden. I do not tell the tale of\nthat garden of Arras, for that is conjecture, and I only tell what I\nsaw, in order that someone perhaps in some far country may know what\nhappened in thousands and thousands of gardens because an Emperor\nsighed, and longed for the splendour of war. The tale is but\nconjecture, yet all the romance is there; for picture a wall over\nfifteen feet high built as they built long ago, standing for all\nthose ages between two gardens. For would not the temptation arise to\npeer over the wall if a young man heard, perhaps songs, one evening\nthe other side? And at first he would have some pretext and\nafterwards none at all, and the pretext would vary wonderfully little\nwith the generations, while the ivy went on growing thicker and\nthicker. The thought might come of climbing the wall altogether and\ndown the other side, and it might seem too daring and be utterly put\naway. And then one day, some wonderful summer evening, the west all\nred and a new moon in the sky, far voices heard clearly and white\nmists rising, one wonderful summer day, back would come that thought\nto climb the great old wall and go down the other side. Why not go in\nnext door from the street, you might say. That would be different,\nthat would be calling; that would mean ceremony, black hats, and\nawkward new gloves, constrained talk and little scope for romance. It\nwould all be the fault of the wall.\n\nWith what diffidence, as the generations passed, would each first\npeep over the wall be undertaken. In some years it would be scaled\nfrom one side, in some ages from the other. What a barrier that old\nred wall would have seemed! How new the adventure would have seemed\nin each age to those that dared it, and how old to the wall! And in\nall those years the elders never made a door, but kept that huge and\nhaughty separation. And the ivy quietly grew greener. And then one\nday a shell came from the east, and, in a moment, without plan or\ndiffidence or pretext, tumbled away some yards of the proud old wall,\nand the two gardens were divided no longer: but there was no one to\nwalk in them any more.\n\nWistfully round the edge of the huge breach in the wall, a Michaelmas\ndaisy peered into the garden, in whose mined paths I stood.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Hell\n\nHe heard an English voice shouting, \"Paiper! Paiper!\" No mere\nspelling of the word will give the intonation. It was the voice of\nEnglish towns he heard again. The very voice of London in the\nmorning. It seemed like magic, or like some wonderfully vivid dream.\n\nHe was only a hundred miles or so from England; it was not very long\nsince he had been there; yet what he heard seemed like an enchanted\ndream, because only the day before he had been in the trenches.\n\nThey had been twelve days in the trenches and had marched out at\nevening. They had marched five miles and were among tin huts in quite\na different world. Through the doorways of the huts green grass could\nbe seen and the sun was shining on it. It was morning. Everything was\nstrangely different. You saw more faces smiling. Men were not so calm\nas they had been during the last twelve days, the last six\nespecially: someone was kicking a football at somebody else's hut and\nthere was excitement about it.\n\nGuns were still firing: but they thought of death now as one who\nwalked on the other side of the hills, no longer as a neighbour, as\none who might drop in at any moment, and sometime did, while they\nwere taking tea. It was not that they had been afraid of him, but the\nstrain of expectancy was over; and that strain being suddenly gone in\na single night, they all had a need, whether they knew it or not, of\nsomething to take its place, so the football loomed very large.\n\nIt was morning and he had slept long. The guns that grew active at\ndawn had not woke him; in those twelve days they had grown too\nfamiliar, but he woke wide when he heard the young English soldier\nwith a bundle of three-days-old papers under his arm calling \"Paiper,\npaiper!\"--bringing to that strange camp the voice of the English\ntowns. He woke wide at that wonder; and saw the sun shining cheerily,\non desolation with a tinge of green in it, which even by itself\nrejoiced him on that morning after those twelve days amongst mud,\nlooking at mud, surrounded by mud, protected by mud, sharing with mud\nthe liability to be suddenly blown high and to come down in a shower\non other men's helmets and coats.\n\nHe wondered if Dante when he came up from Hell heard anyone calling\namongst the Verdure, in sunlight, any familiar call such as merchants\nuse, some trivial song or cry of his native city.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Happy Valley\n\n\"The enemy attacked the Happy Valley.\" I read these words in a paper\nat the time of the taking of Albert, for the second time, by our\ntroops. And the words brought back Albert to me like a spell, Albert\nat the end of the mighty Bapaume-Albert road, that pathway Of Mars\ndown which he had stalked so tremendously through his garden, the\nwide waste battlefields of the Somme. The words brought back Albert\nat the end of that road in the sunset and the cathedral seen against\nthe west, and the gilded Virgin half cast down, but incapable of\nlosing dignity, and evening coming down over the marshes. They\nbrought it back like a spell. Like two spells rather, that some\nmagician had mixed. Picture some magician of old in his sombre\nwonderful, chamber wishing dreams to transport him far off to\ndelectable valleys. He sits him down and writes out a spell on\nparchment, slowly and with effort of aged memory, though he\nremembered it easily once. The shadows of crocodiles and antique gods\nflicker on walls and ceiling from a gusty flame as he writes; and in\nthe end he writes the spell out wrongly and mixes up with the valleys\nwhere he would rest dark bits of the regions of Hell. So one sees\nAlbert again and its Happy Valley.\n\nI do not know which the Happy Valley is, for so many little valleys\nrun in and out about Albert; and with a little effort of imagination,\nhaving only seen them full of the ruin of war, one can fancy any of\nthem being once named happy. Yet one there is away to the east of\nAlbert, which even up to last autumn seemed able to bear this name,\nso secluded it was in that awful garden of Mars; a tiny valley\nrunning into the wood of B\u00e9court. A few yards, higher up and all was\ndesolation, a little further along a lonely road and you saw Albert\nmourning over irreparable vistas of ruin and wasted fields; but the\nlittle valley ran into the wood of B\u00e9court and sheltered there, and\nthere you saw scarcely any signs of war. It might almost have been an\nEnglish valley, by the side of an English wood. The soil was the same\nbrown clay that you see in the south Of England above the downs and\nthe chalk; the wood was a hazel wood, such as grow in England,\nthinned a good deal, as English hazels are, but with several tall\ntrees still growing; and plants were there and late flowers, such as\ngrow in Surrey and Kent. And at the end of the valley, just in the\nshadow of that familiar homely wood, a hundred British officers rest\nfor ever.\n\nAs the world is today perhaps that obscure spot, as fittingly as any,\nmight be named the Happy Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Bethune\n\nUnder all ruins is history, as every tourist knows. Indeed, the dust\nthat gathers above the ruin of cities may be said to be the cover of\nthe most wonderful of the picture-books of Time, those secret books\ninto which we sometimes peep. We turn no more, perhaps, than the\ncorner of a single page in our prying, but we catch a glimpse there\nof things so gorgeous, in the book that we are not meant to see, that\nit is worth while to travel to far countries, whoever can, to see one\nof those books, and where the edges are turned up a little to catch\nsight of those strange winged bulls and mysterious kings and\nlion-headed gods that were not meant for us. And out of the glimpses,\none catches from odd comers of those volumes of Time, where old\ncenturies hide, one builds up part by guesses, part by fancy mixed\nwith but little knowledge, a tale or theory of how men and women\nlived in unknown ages in the faith of forgotten gods.\n\nSuch a people lived in Timgad and left it probably about the time\nthat waning Rome began to call home her outposts. Long after the\ncitizens left the city stood on that high plateau in Africa, teaching\nshepherd Arabs what Rome had been: even to-day its great arches and\nparts of its temples stand: its paved streets are still grooved\nclearly with the wheel-ruts of chariots, and beaten down on each side\nof the centre by the pairs of horses that drew them two thousand\nyears ago. When all the clatter had died away Timgad stood there in\nsilence.\n\nAt Pompeii, city and citizens ended together. Pompeii did not mourn\namong strangers, a city without a people: but was buried at once,\nclosed like an ancient book.\n\nI doubt if anyone knows why its gods deserted Luxor, or Luxor lost\nfaith in its gods, or in itself; conquest from over the desert or\ndown the Nile, I suppose, or corruption within. Who knows? But one\nday I saw a woman come out from the back of her house and empty a\nbasket full of dust and rubbish right into the temple at Luxor, where\na dark green god is seated, three times the size of a man, buried as\nhigh as his waist. I suppose that what I saw had been happening off\nand on pretty well every morning for the last four thousand years.\nSafe under the dust that that woman threw, and the women that lived\nbefore her, Time hid his secrets.\n\nAnd then I have seen the edges of stones in deserts that might or\nmight not have been cities: they had fallen so long that you could\nhardly say.\n\nAt all these cities, whether disaster met them, and ruin came\nsuddenly on to crowded streets; or whether they passed slowly out of\nfashion, and grew quieter year by year while the jackals drew nearer\nand nearer; at all these cities one can look with interest and not be\nsaddened by the faintest sorrow--for anything that happened to such a\ndifferent people so very long ago. Ram-headed gods, although their\nhorns be broken and all their worshippers gone; armies whose\nelephants have turned against them; kings whose ancestors have\neclipsed their faces in heaven and left them helpless against the\nonslaught of the stars; not a tear is given for one of these to-day.\n\nBut when in ruins as complete as Pompeii, as desolate as Timgad\namongst its African hills, you see the remnant of a pack of cards\nlying with what remains of the stock of a draper's shop; and the\nfront part of the shop and the snug room at the back gape side by\nside together in equal, misery, as though there had never been a\nbarrier between the counter with its wares and the good mahogany\ntable with its decanters; then in the rustling of papers that blow\nwith dust along long-desolate floors one hears the whisper of\nDisaster, saying, \"See; I have come.\" For under plaster shaken down\nby calamity, and red dust that once was bricks, it is our own age\nthat is lying; and the little things that lie about the floors are\nrelics of the twentieth century. Therefore in the streets of Bethune\nthe wistful appeal that is in all things lost far off and utterly\npassed away cries out with an insistence that is never felt in the\nolder fallen cities. No doubt to future times the age that lies under\nplaster in Bethune, with thin, bare laths standing over it, will\nappear an age of glory; and yet to thousands that went one day from\nits streets, leaving all manner of small things behind, it may well\nhave been an age full of far other promises, no less golden to them,\nno less magical even, though too little to stir the pen of History,\nbusy with batteries and imperial dooms. So that to these, whatever\nothers may write, the twentieth-century will not be the age of\nstrategy, but will only seem to have been those fourteen lost quiet\nsummers whose fruits lie under the plaster.\n\nThat layer of plaster and brick-dust lies on the age that has gone,\nas final, as fatal, as the layer of flints that covers the top of the\nchalk and marks the end of an epoch and some unknown geologic\ncatastrophe.\n\nIt is only by the little things in Bethune, lying where they were\nleft, that one can trace at all what kind of house each was, or guess\nat the people who dwelt in it. It is only by a potato growing where\nPavement was, and flowering vigorously under a vacant window, that\none can guess that the battered, house beside it was once a\nfruiterer's shop, whence the potato rolled away when man fell on evil\ndays, and found the street, no longer harsh and unfriendly; but soft\nand fertile like the primal waste, and took root and throve there as\nits forbears throve before it in another continent before the coming\nof man.\n\nAcross the street, in the dust of a stricken house, the implements of\nhis trade show where a carpenter lived when disaster came so\nsuddenly, quite good tools, some still upon shelves, some amongst\nbroken things that lie all over the floor. And further along the\nstreet in which these things are someone has put up a great iron\nshutter that was to protect his shop. It has a graceful border of\npainted, irises all the way up each side. It might have been a\njeweller that would have had such a shutter. The shutter alone\nremains standing straight upright, and the whole shop is gone.\n\nAnd just here the shaken street ends and all the streets end\ntogether. The rest is a mound of white stones and pieces of bricks\nwith low, leaning walls surrounding it, and the halves of hollow\nhouses; and eyeing it round a comer, one old tower of the cathedral,\nas though still gazing over its congregation of houses, a mined,\nmelancholy watcher. Over the bricks lie tracks, but no more streets.\nIt is about the middle of the town, a hawk goes over, calling as\nthough he flew over the waste, and as though the waste were his. The\nbreeze that carries him opens old shutters and flaps them to again.\nOld, useless hinges moan; wall-paper whispers. Three French soldiers\ntrying to find their homes walk over the bricks and groundsel.\n\nIt is the Abomination of Desolation, not seen by prophecy far off in\nsome fabulous future, nor  remembered  from terrible ages by the aid\nof papyrus and stone, but fallen on our own century, on the homes of\nfolk like ourselves: common things that we knew are become the relics\nof bygone days. It is our own time that has ended in blood and broken\nbricks.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn An Old Drawing-Room\n\nThere was one house with a roof on it in Peronne. And there an\nofficer came by moonlight on his way back from leave. He was looking\nfor his battalion which had moved and was now somewhere in the\ndesolation out in front of Peronne, or else was marching there--no\none quite knew. Someone said he had seen it marching through\nTincourt; the R.T.O. said Brie. Those who did not know were always\nready to help, they made suggestions and even pulled out maps. Why\nshould they not? They were giving away no secret, because they did\nnot know, and so they followed a soldier's natural inclination to\ngive all the help they could to another soldier. Therefore they\noffered their suggestions like old friends. They had never met\nbefore, might never meet again; but La France introduces you, and\nfive minute acquaintance in a place like Peronne, where things may\nchange so profoundly in one night, and where all is so tense by the\nstrange background of ruin that little portions of time seem very\nvaluable, five minutes there seem quite a long time. And so they are,\nfor what may not happen in five minutes any day now in France. Five\nminutes may be a page of history, a chapter even, perhaps a volume.\nLittle children with inky fingers years hence may sit for a whole\nhour trying to learn up and remember just what happened during five\nminutes in France some time about now. These are just reflections\nsuch as pass through the mind in the moonlight among vast ruins and\nare at once forgotten.\n\nThose that knew where the battalion was that the wandering officer\nlooked for were not many; these were reserved and spoke like one that\nhas a murder on his conscience, not freely and openly: for of one\nthing no one speaks in France, and that is the exact position of a\nunit. One may wave one's hand vaguely eastwards and say \"Over\nthere,\", but to name a village and the people that  occupy it is to\noffend against the silence that in these days broods over France, the\nsolemn hush befitting so vast a tragedy.\n\nAnd in the end it seemed better to that officer to obey the R.T.O.\nand to go by his train to Brie that left in the morning, and that\nquestion settled, there remained only food and sleep.\n\nDown in the basement of the big house with a roof there was a\nkitchen, in fact there was everything that a house should have; and\nthe more that one saw of simple household things, tables, chairs, the\nfire in the kitchen, pieces of carpet, floors, ceilings, and even\nwindows, the more one wondered; it did not seem natural in Peronne.\n\nPicture to yourself a fine drawing-room with high ornamental walls\nand all the air about it of dignity, peace and ease, that were so\nrecently gone; only just, as it might have been, stepped through the\ndouble doorway; skirts, as it were, of ladies only just trailed out\nof sight; and then turn in fancy to that great town streaming with\nmoonlight, full of the mystery that moonlight always brings, but\nwithout the light of it; all black, dark as caverns of earth where no\nlight ever came, blacker for the moonlight than if no moon were\nthere; sombre, mourning and accursed, each house in the great streets\nsheltering darkness amongst its windowless walls; as though it nursed\ndisaster, having no other children left, and would not let the moon\npeer in on its grief or see the monstrous orphan that it fondled.\n\nIn the old drawing-room with twenty others, the wandering officer lay\ndown to sleep on the floor, and thought of old wars that came to the\ncities of France a long while ago. To just such houses as this, he\nthought, men must have come before and gone on next day to fight in\nother centuries; it seemed to him that it must have been more\nromantic then. Who knows?\n\nHe had a bit of carpet to lie on. A few more officers came in in the\nearly part of the night, and talked a little and lay down. A few\ncandles were stuck on tables here and there. Midnight would have\nstruck from the towers had any clock been left to strike in Peronne.\nStill talk went on in low voices here and there. The candles burned\nlow and were fewer. Big shadows floated along those old high walls.\nThen the talk ceased and everyone was still: nothing stirred but the\nshadows. An officer muttered in sleep of things far thence, and was\nsilent. Far away shells thumped faintly. The shadows, left to\nthemselves, went round and round the room, searching in every corner\nfor something that was lost. Over walls and ceiling they went and\ncould not find it. The last candle was failing. It flared and\nguttered. The shadows raced over the room from comer to corner. Lost,\nand they could not find it. They hurried desperately in those last\nfew moments. Great shadows searching for some little thing. In the\nsmallest nook they sought for it. Then the last candle died. As the\nflame went up with the smoke from the fallen wick all the great\nshadows turned and mournfully trailed away.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Homes Of Arras\n\nAs you come to Arras by the western road, by the red ramparts and the\nSpanish gate, Arras looks like a king. With such a dignity as clings\nto the ancient gateway so might a king be crowned; with such a sweep\nof dull red as the old ramparts show, so might he be robed; but a\ndead king with crowned skull. For the ways of Arras are empty but for\nbrown soldiers, and her houses are bare as bones.\n\nArras sleeps profoundly, roofless, windowless, carpetless; Arras\nsleeps as a skeleton sleeps, with all the dignity of former days\nabout it, but the life that stirs in its streets is not the old\ncity's life, the old city is murdered. I came to Arras and went down\na street, and saw back gardens glinting through the bare ribs of the\nhouses. Garden after garden shone, so far as it could, though it was\nin October and after four years of war; but what was left of those\ngardens shining there in the sun was like sad faces trying to smile\nafter many disasters.\n\nI came to a great wall that no shell had breached. A cascade of\nscarlet creeper poured over it, as though on the other side some\nserene garden grew, where no disaster came, tended by girls who had\nnever heard of war, walking untrodden paths. It was not so. But one's\nfancy, weary of ruin, readily turns to such scenes wherever facts are\nhidden, though but by a tottering wall, led by a few bright leaves or\nthe glimpse of a flower.\n\nBut not for any fancy of mine must you picture ruin any more as\nsomething graced with splendour, or as it were an argosy reaching the\nshores of our day laden with grandeur and dignity out of antiquity.\nRuin to-day is not covered with ivy, and has no curious architecture\nor strange secrets of history, and is not beautiful or romantic at\nall. It has no tale to tell of old civilizations, not otherwise\nknown, told of by few grey stones. Ruin to-day is destruction and\nsorrow and debt and loss, come down untidily upon modern homes and\ncutting off ordinary generations, smashing the implements of familiar\ntrades and making common avocations obsolete. It is no longer the\nguardian and the chronicle of ages that we should otherwise forget:\nruin to-day is an age heaped up in rubble around us before it has\nceased to be still green in our memory. Quite ordinary wardrobes in\nunseemly attitudes gape out from bedrooms whose front walls are gone,\nin houses whose most inner design shows unconcealed to the cold gaze\nof the street. The rooms have neither mystery nor adornment. Burst\nmattresses loll down from bedraggled beds. No one has come to tidy\nthem up for years. And roofs have slanted down as low as the first\nfloor.\n\nI saw a green door ajar in an upper room: the whole of the front wall\nof the house was gone: the door partly opened oddly on to a little\nstaircase, whose steps one could just see, that one wondered whither\nit went. The door seemed to beckon and beckon to some lost room, but\nif one could ever have got there, up through that shattered house,\nand if the steps of that little staircase would bear, so that one\ncame to, the room that is hidden away at the top, yet there could\nonly be silence and spiders there, and broken plaster and the dust of\ncalamity; it is only to memories that the green door beckons; nothing\nremains.\n\nAnd some day they may come to Arras to see the romance of war, to see\nwhere the shells struck and to pick up pieces of iron. It is not this\nthat is romantic, not Mars, but poor, limping Peace. It is what is\nleft that appeals to you, with pathos and infinite charm; little\ndesolate gardens that no one has tended for years, wall-paper left in\nforlorn rooms when all else is Scattered, old toys buried in rubbish,\nold steps untrodden on inaccessible landings: it is what is left that\nappeals to you, what remains of old peaceful things. The great guns\nthrob on, all round is the panoply of war, if panoply be the right\nword for this vast disaster that is known to Arras as innumerable\nseparate sorrows; but it is not to this great event that-the sympathy\nturns in Arras, nor to its thunder and show, nor the trappings of it,\nguns lorries, and fragments of shells: it is to the voiceless,\ndeserted inanimate things, so greatly wronged, that all the heart\ngoes out: floors fallen in festoons, windows that seem to be wailing,\nroofs as though crazed with grief and then petrified in their\ncraziness; railings, lamp-posts, sticks, all hit, nothing spared by\nthat frenzied iron: the very earth clawed and-torn: it is what is\nleft that appeals to you.\n\nAs I went from Arras I passed by a grey, gaunt shape, the ghost of a\nrailway station standing in the wilderness haunting a waste of weeds,\nand mourning, as it seemed, over rusted railway lines lying idle and\npurposeless as though leading nowhere, as though all roads had\nceased, and all lands were deserted, and all travellers dead:\nsorrowful and lonely that ghostly shape stood dumb in the desolation\namong houses whose doors were shut and their windows broken. And in\nall that stricken assembly no voice spoke but the sound of iron\ntapping on broken things, which was dumb awhile when the wind\ndropped. The wind rose and it tapped again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Unhappy Far-Off Things, by Lord Dunsany\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNHAPPY FAR-OFF THINGS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 13820-8.txt or 13820-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/8/2/13820/\n\nProduced by Tom Harris\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
