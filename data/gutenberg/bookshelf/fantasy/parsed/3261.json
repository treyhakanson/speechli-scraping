For the rest,\nthere were six persons present, and consequently six sections of the\nparty were represented, four of which had strong but divergent Anarchist\nopinions.  One of the sections, says our friend, a man whom he knows very\nwell indeed, sat almost silent at the beginning of the discussion, but at\nlast got drawn into it, and finished by roaring out very loud, and\ndamning all the rest for fools; after which befel a period of noise, and\nthen a lull, during which the aforesaid section, having said good-night\nvery amicably, took his way home by himself to a western suburb, using\nthe means of travelling which civilisation has forced upon us like a\nhabit.  As he sat in that vapour-bath of hurried and discontented\nhumanity, a carriage of the underground railway, he, like others, stewed\ndiscontentedly, while in self-reproachful mood he turned over the many\nexcellent and conclusive arguments which, though they lay at his fingers'\nends, he had forgotten in the just past discussion.  But this frame of\nmind he was so used to, that it didn't last him long, and after a brief\ndiscomfort, caused by disgust with himself for having lost his temper\n(which he was also well used to), he found himself musing on the subject-\nmatter of discussion, but still discontentedly and unhappily.  \"If I\ncould but see a day of it,\" he said to himself; \"if I could but see it!\"\n\nAs he formed the words, the train stopped at his station, five minutes'\nwalk from his own house, which stood on the banks of the Thames, a little\nway above an ugly suspension bridge.  He went out of the station, still\ndiscontented and unhappy, muttering \"If I could but see it! if I could\nbut see it!\" but had not gone many steps towards the river before (says\nour friend who tells the story) all that discontent and trouble seemed to\nslip off him.\n\nIt was a beautiful night of early winter, the air just sharp enough to be\nrefreshing after the hot room and the stinking railway carriage.  The\nwind, which had lately turned a point or two north of west, had blown the\nsky clear of all cloud save a light fleck or two which went swiftly down\nthe heavens.  There was a young moon halfway up the sky, and as the home-\nfarer caught sight of it, tangled in the branches of a tall old elm, he\ncould scarce bring to his mind the shabby London suburb where he was, and\nhe felt as if he were in a pleasant country place--pleasanter, indeed,\nthan the deep country was as he had known it.\n\nHe came right down to the river-side, and lingered a little, looking over\nthe low wall to note the moonlit river, near upon high water, go swirling\nand glittering up to Chiswick Eyot: as for the ugly bridge below, he did\nnot notice it or think of it, except when for a moment (says our friend)\nit struck him that he missed the row of lights down stream.  Then he\nturned to his house door and let himself in; and even as he shut the door\nto, disappeared all remembrance of that brilliant logic and foresight\nwhich had so illuminated the recent discussion; and of the discussion\nitself there remained no trace, save a vague hope, that was now become a\npleasure, for days of peace and rest, and cleanness and smiling goodwill.\n\nIn this mood he tumbled into bed, and fell asleep after his wont, in two\nminutes' time; but (contrary to his wont) woke up again not long after in\nthat curiously wide-awake condition which sometimes surprises even good\nsleepers; a condition under which we feel all our wits preternaturally\nsharpened, while all the miserable muddles we have ever got into, all the\ndisgraces and losses of our lives, will insist on thrusting themselves\nforward for the consideration of those sharpened wits.\n\nIn this state he lay (says our friend) till he had almost begun to enjoy\nit: till the tale of his stupidities amused him, and the entanglements\nbefore him, which he saw so clearly, began to shape themselves into an\namusing story for him.\n\nHe heard one o'clock strike, then two and then three; after which he fell\nasleep again.  Our friend says that from that sleep he awoke once more,\nand afterwards went through such surprising adventures that he thinks\nthat they should be told to our comrades, and indeed the public in\ngeneral, and therefore proposes to tell them now.  But, says he, I think\nit would be better if I told them in the first person, as if it were\nmyself who had gone through them; which, indeed, will be the easier and\nmore natural to me, since I understand the feelings and desires of the\ncomrade of whom I am telling better than any one else in the world does.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: A MORNING BATH\n\n\nWell, I awoke, and found that I had kicked my bedclothes off; and no\nwonder, for it was hot and the sun shining brightly.  I jumped up and\nwashed and hurried on my clothes, but in a hazy and half-awake condition,\nas if I had slept for a long, long while, and could not shake off the\nweight of slumber.  In fact, I rather took it for granted that I was at\nhome in my own room than saw that it was so.\n\nWhen I was dressed, I felt the place so hot that I made haste to get out\nof the room and out of the house; and my first feeling was a delicious\nrelief caused by the fresh air and pleasant breeze; my second, as I began\nto gather my wits together, mere measureless wonder: for it was winter\nwhen I went to bed the last night, and now, by witness of the river-side\ntrees, it was summer, a beautiful bright morning seemingly of early June.\nHowever, there was still the Thames sparkling under the sun, and near\nhigh water, as last night I had seen it gleaming under the moon.\n\nI had by no means shaken off the feeling of oppression, and wherever I\nmight have been should scarce have been quite conscious of the place; so\nit was no wonder that I felt rather puzzled in despite of the familiar\nface of the Thames.  Withal I felt dizzy and queer; and remembering that\npeople often got a boat and had a swim in mid-stream, I thought I would\ndo no less.  It seems very early, quoth I to myself, but I daresay I\nshall find someone at Biffin's to take me.  However, I didn't get as far\nas Biffin's, or even turn to my left thitherward, because just then I\nbegan to see that there was a landing-stage right before me in front of\nmy house: in fact, on the place where my next-door neighbour had rigged\none up, though somehow it didn't look like that either.  Down I went on\nto it, and sure enough among the empty boats moored to it lay a man on\nhis sculls in a solid-looking tub of a boat clearly meant for bathers.  He\nnodded to me, and bade me good-morning as if he expected me, so I jumped\nin without any words, and he paddled away quietly as I peeled for my\nswim.  As we went, I looked down on the water, and couldn't help saying--\n\n\"How clear the water is this morning!\"\n\n\"Is it?\" said he; \"I didn't notice it.  You know the flood-tide always\nthickens it a bit.\"\n\n\"H'm,\" said I, \"I have seen it pretty muddy even at half-ebb.\"\n\nHe said nothing in answer, but seemed rather astonished; and as he now\nlay just stemming the tide, and I had my clothes off, I jumped in without\nmore ado.  Of course when I had my head above water again I turned\ntowards the tide, and my eyes naturally sought for the bridge, and so\nutterly astonished was I by what I saw, that I forgot to strike out, and\nwent spluttering under water again, and when I came up made straight for\nthe boat; for I felt that I must ask some questions of my waterman, so\nbewildering had been the half-sight I had seen from the face of the river\nwith the water hardly out of my eyes; though by this time I was quit of\nthe slumbrous and dizzy feeling, and was wide-awake and clear-headed.\n\nAs I got in up the steps which he had lowered, and he held out his hand\nto help me, we went drifting speedily up towards Chiswick; but now he\ncaught up the sculls and brought her head round again, and said--\"A short\nswim, neighbour; but perhaps you find the water cold this morning, after\nyour journey.  Shall I put you ashore at once, or would you like to go\ndown to Putney before breakfast?\"\n\nHe spoke in a way so unlike what I should have expected from a\nHammersmith waterman, that I stared at him, as I answered, \"Please to\nhold her a little; I want to look about me a bit.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said; \"it's no less pretty in its way here than it is off\nBarn Elms; it's jolly everywhere this time in the morning.  I'm glad you\ngot up early; it's barely five o'clock yet.\"\n\nIf I was astonished with my sight of the river banks, I was no less\nastonished at my waterman, now that I had time to look at him and see him\nwith my head and eyes clear.\n\nHe was a handsome young fellow, with a peculiarly pleasant and friendly\nlook about his eyes,--an expression which was quite new to me then,\nthough I soon became familiar with it.  For the rest, he was dark-haired\nand berry-brown of skin, well-knit and strong, and obviously used to\nexercising his muscles, but with nothing rough or coarse about him, and\nclean as might be.  His dress was not like any modern work-a-day clothes\nI had seen, but would have served very well as a costume for a picture of\nfourteenth century life: it was of dark blue cloth, simple enough, but of\nfine web, and without a stain on it.  He had a brown leather belt round\nhis waist, and I noticed that its clasp was of damascened steel\nbeautifully wrought.  In short, he seemed to be like some specially manly\nand refined young gentleman, playing waterman for a spree, and I\nconcluded that this was the case.\n\nI felt that I must make some conversation; so I pointed to the Surrey\nbank, where I noticed some light plank stages running down the foreshore,\nwith windlasses at the landward end of them, and said, \"What are they\ndoing with those things here?  If we were on the Tay, I should have said\nthat they were for drawing the salmon nets; but here--\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, smiling, \"of course that is what they _are_ for.  Where\nthere are salmon, there are likely to be salmon-nets, Tay or Thames; but\nof course they are not always in use; we don't want salmon _every_ day of\nthe season.\"\n\nI was going to say, \"But is this the Thames?\" but held my peace in my\nwonder, and turned my bewildered eyes eastward to look at the bridge\nagain, and thence to the shores of the London river; and surely there was\nenough to astonish me.  For though there was a bridge across the stream\nand houses on its banks, how all was changed from last night!  The soap-\nworks with their smoke-vomiting chimneys were gone; the engineer's works\ngone; the lead-works gone; and no sound of rivetting and hammering came\ndown the west wind from Thorneycroft's.  Then the bridge!  I had perhaps\ndreamed of such a bridge, but never seen such an one out of an\nilluminated manuscript; for not even the Ponte Vecchio at Florence came\nanywhere near it.  It was of stone arches, splendidly solid, and as\ngraceful as they were strong; high enough also to let ordinary river\ntraffic through easily.  Over the parapet showed quaint and fanciful\nlittle buildings, which I supposed to be booths or shops, beset with\npainted and gilded vanes and spirelets.  The stone was a little\nweathered, but showed no marks of the grimy sootiness which I was used to\non every London building more than a year old.  In short, to me a wonder\nof a bridge.\n\nThe sculler noted my eager astonished look, and said, as if in answer to\nmy thoughts--\n\n\"Yes, it _is_ a pretty bridge, isn't it?  Even the up-stream bridges,\nwhich are so much smaller, are scarcely daintier, and the down-stream\nones are scarcely more dignified and stately.\"\n\nI found myself saying, almost against my will, \"How old is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, not very old,\" he said; \"it was built or at least opened, in 2003.\nThere used to be a rather plain timber bridge before then.\"\n\nThe date shut my mouth as if a key had been turned in a padlock fixed to\nmy lips; for I saw that something inexplicable had happened, and that if\nI said much, I should be mixed up in a game of cross questions and\ncrooked answers.  So I tried to look unconcerned, and to glance in a\nmatter-of-course way at the banks of the river, though this is what I saw\nup to the bridge and a little beyond; say as far as the site of the soap-\nworks.  Both shores had a line of very pretty houses, low and not large,\nstanding back a little way from the river; they were mostly built of red\nbrick and roofed with tiles, and looked, above all, comfortable, and as\nif they were, so to say, alive, and sympathetic with the life of the\ndwellers in them.  There was a continuous garden in front of them, going\ndown to the water's edge, in which the flowers were now blooming\nluxuriantly, and sending delicious waves of summer scent over the eddying\nstream.  Behind the houses, I could see great trees rising, mostly\nplanes, and looking down the water there were the reaches towards Putney\nalmost as if they were a lake with a forest shore, so thick were the big\ntrees; and I said aloud, but as if to myself--\n\n\"Well, I'm glad that they have not built over Barn Elms.\"\n\nI blushed for my fatuity as the words slipped out of my mouth, and my\ncompanion looked at me with a half smile which I thought I understood; so\nto hide my confusion I said, \"Please take me ashore now: I want to get my\nbreakfast.\"\n\nHe nodded, and brought her head round with a sharp stroke, and in a trice\nwe were at the landing-stage again.  He jumped out and I followed him;\nand of course I was not surprised to see him wait, as if for the\ninevitable after-piece that follows the doing of a service to a fellow-\ncitizen.  So I put my hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and said, \"How\nmuch?\" though still with the uncomfortable feeling that perhaps I was\noffering money to a gentleman.\n\nHe looked puzzled, and said, \"How much?  I don't quite understand what\nyou are asking about.  Do you mean the tide?  If so, it is close on the\nturn now.\"\n\nI blushed, and said, stammering, \"Please don't take it amiss if I ask\nyou; I mean no offence: but what ought I to pay you?  You see I am a\nstranger, and don't know your customs--or your coins.\"\n\nAnd therewith I took a handful of money out of my pocket, as one does in\na foreign country.  And by the way, I saw that the silver had oxydised,\nand was like a blackleaded stove in colour.\n\nHe still seemed puzzled, but not at all offended; and he looked at the\ncoins with some curiosity.  I thought, Well after all, he _is_ a\nwaterman, and is considering what he may venture to take.  He seems such\na nice fellow that I'm sure I don't grudge him a little over-payment.  I\nwonder, by the way, whether I couldn't hire him as a guide for a day or\ntwo, since he is so intelligent.\n\nTherewith my new friend said thoughtfully:\n\n\"I think I know what you mean.  You think that I have done you a service;\nso you feel yourself bound to give me something which I am not to give to\na neighbour, unless he has done something special for me.  I have heard\nof this kind of thing; but pardon me for saying, that it seems to us a\ntroublesome and roundabout custom; and we don't know how to manage it.\nAnd you see this ferrying and giving people casts about the water is my\n_business_, which I would do for anybody; so to take gifts in connection\nwith it would look very queer.  Besides, if one person gave me something,\nthen another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won't think me\nrude if I say that I shouldn't know where to stow away so many mementos\nof friendship.\"\n\nAnd he laughed loud and merrily, as if the idea of being paid for his\nwork was a very funny joke.  I confess I began to be afraid that the man\nwas mad, though he looked sane enough; and I was rather glad to think\nthat I was a good swimmer, since we were so close to a deep swift stream.\nHowever, he went on by no means like a madman:\n\n\"As to your coins, they are curious, but not very old; they seem to be\nall of the reign of Victoria; you might give them to some\nscantily-furnished museum.  Ours has enough of such coins, besides a fair\nnumber of earlier ones, many of which are beautiful, whereas these\nnineteenth century ones are so beastly ugly, ain't they?  We have a piece\nof Edward III., with the king in a ship, and little leopards and fleurs-\nde-lys all along the gunwale, so delicately worked.  You see,\" he said,\nwith something of a smirk, \"I am fond of working in gold and fine metals;\nthis buckle here is an early piece of mine.\"\n\nNo doubt I looked a little shy of him under the influence of that doubt\nas to his sanity.  So he broke off short, and said in a kind voice:\n\n\"But I see that I am boring you, and I ask your pardon.  For, not to\nmince matters, I can tell that you _are_ a stranger, and must come from a\nplace very unlike England.  But also it is clear that it won't do to\noverdose you with information about this place, and that you had best\nsuck it in little by little.  Further, I should take it as very kind in\nyou if you would allow me to be the showman of our new world to you,\nsince you have stumbled on me first.  Though indeed it will be a mere\nkindness on your part, for almost anybody would make as good a guide, and\nmany much better.\"\n\nThere certainly seemed no flavour in him of Colney Hatch; and besides I\nthought I could easily shake him off if it turned out that he really was\nmad; so I said:\n\n\"It is a very kind offer, but it is difficult for me to accept it,\nunless--\"  I was going to say, Unless you will let me pay you properly;\nbut fearing to stir up Colney Hatch again, I changed the sentence into,\n\"I fear I shall be taking you away from your work--or your amusement.\"\n\n\"O,\" he said, \"don't trouble about that, because it will give me an\nopportunity of doing a good turn to a friend of mine, who wants to take\nmy work here.  He is a weaver from Yorkshire, who has rather overdone\nhimself between his weaving and his mathematics, both indoor work, you\nsee; and being a great friend of mine, he naturally came to me to get him\nsome outdoor work.  If you think you can put up with me, pray take me as\nyour guide.\"\n\nHe added presently: \"It is true that I have promised to go up-stream to\nsome special friends of mine, for the hay-harvest; but they won't be\nready for us for more than a week: and besides, you might go with me, you\nknow, and see some very nice people, besides making notes of our ways in\nOxfordshire.  You could hardly do better if you want to see the country.\"\n\nI felt myself obliged to thank him, whatever might come of it; and he\nadded eagerly:\n\n\"Well, then, that's settled.  I will give my friend a call; he is living in\nthe Guest House like you, and if he isn't up yet, he ought to be this\nfine summer morning.\"\n\nTherewith he took a little silver bugle-horn from his girdle and blew two\nor three sharp but agreeable notes on it; and presently from the house\nwhich stood on the site of my old dwelling (of which more hereafter)\nanother young man came sauntering towards us.  He was not so well-looking\nor so strongly made as my sculler friend, being sandy-haired, rather\npale, and not stout-built; but his face was not wanting in that happy and\nfriendly expression which I had noticed in his friend.  As he came up\nsmiling towards us, I saw with pleasure that I must give up the Colney\nHatch theory as to the waterman, for no two madmen ever behaved as they\ndid before a sane man.  His dress also was of the same cut as the first\nman's, though somewhat gayer, the surcoat being light green with a golden\nspray embroidered on the breast, and his belt being of filagree silver-\nwork.\n\nHe gave me good-day very civilly, and greeting his friend joyously, said:\n\n\"Well, Dick, what is it this morning?  Am I to have my work, or rather\nyour work?  I dreamed last night that we were off up the river fishing.\"\n\n\"All right, Bob,\" said my sculler; \"you will drop into my place, and if\nyou find it too much, there is George Brightling on the look out for a\nstroke of work, and he lives close handy to you.  But see, here is a\nstranger who is willing to amuse me to-day by taking me as his guide\nabout our country-side, and you may imagine I don't want to lose the\nopportunity; so you had better take to the boat at once.  But in any case\nI shouldn't have kept you out of it for long, since I am due in the hay-\nfields in a few days.\"\n\nThe newcomer rubbed his hands with glee, but turning to me, said in a\nfriendly voice:\n\n\"Neighbour, both you and friend Dick are lucky, and will have a good time\nto-day, as indeed I shall too.  But you had better both come in with me\nat once and get something to eat, lest you should forget your dinner in\nyour amusement.  I suppose you came into the Guest House after I had gone\nto bed last night?\"\n\nI nodded, not caring to enter into a long explanation which would have\nled to nothing, and which in truth by this time I should have begun to\ndoubt myself.  And we all three turned toward the door of the Guest\nHouse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III: THE GUEST HOUSE AND BREAKFAST THEREIN\n\n\nI lingered a little behind the others to have a stare at this house,\nwhich, as I have told you, stood on the site of my old dwelling.\n\nIt was a longish building with its gable ends turned away from the road,\nand long traceried windows coming rather low down set in the wall that\nfaced us.  It was very handsomely built of red brick with a lead roof;\nand high up above the windows there ran a frieze of figure subjects in\nbaked clay, very well executed, and designed with a force and directness\nwhich I had never noticed in modern work before.  The subjects I\nrecognised at once, and indeed was very particularly familiar with them.\n\nHowever, all this I took in in a minute; for we were presently within\ndoors, and standing in a hall with a floor of marble mosaic and an open\ntimber roof.  There were no windows on the side opposite to the river,\nbut arches below leading into chambers, one of which showed a glimpse of\na garden beyond, and above them a long space of wall gaily painted (in\nfresco, I thought) with similar subjects to those of the frieze outside;\neverything about the place was handsome and generously solid as to\nmaterial; and though it was not very large (somewhat smaller than Crosby\nHall perhaps), one felt in it that exhilarating sense of space and\nfreedom which satisfactory architecture always gives to an unanxious man\nwho is in the habit of using his eyes.\n\nIn this pleasant place, which of course I knew to be the hall of the\nGuest House, three young women were flitting to and fro.  As they were\nthe first of the sex I had seen on this eventful morning, I naturally\nlooked at them very attentively, and found them at least as good as the\ngardens, the architecture, and the male men.  As to their dress, which of\ncourse I took note of, I should say that they were decently veiled with\ndrapery, and not bundled up with millinery; that they were clothed like\nwomen, not upholstered like armchairs, as most women of our time are.  In\nshort, their dress was somewhat between that of the ancient classical\ncostume and the simpler forms of the fourteenth century garments, though\nit was clearly not an imitation of either: the materials were light and\ngay to suit the season.  As to the women themselves, it was pleasant\nindeed to see them, they were so kind and happy-looking in expression of\nface, so shapely and well-knit of body, and thoroughly healthy-looking\nand strong.  All were at least comely, and one of them very handsome and\nregular of feature.  They came up to us at once merrily and without the\nleast affectation of shyness, and all three shook hands with me as if I\nwere a friend newly come back from a long journey: though I could not\nhelp noticing that they looked askance at my garments; for I had on my\nclothes of last night, and at the best was never a dressy person.\n\nA word or two from Robert the weaver, and they bustled about on our\nbehoof, and presently came and took us by the hands and led us to a table\nin the pleasantest corner of the hall, where our breakfast was spread for\nus; and, as we sat down, one of them hurried out by the chambers\naforesaid, and came back again in a little while with a great bunch of\nroses, very different in size and quality to what Hammersmith had been\nwont to grow, but very like the produce of an old country garden.  She\nhurried back thence into the buttery, and came back once more with a\ndelicately made glass, into which she put the flowers and set them down\nin the midst of our table.  One of the others, who had run off also, then\ncame back with a big cabbage-leaf filled with strawberries, some of them\nbarely ripe, and said as she set them on the table, \"There, now; I\nthought of that before I got up this morning; but looking at the stranger\nhere getting into your boat, Dick, put it out of my head; so that I was\nnot before _all_ the blackbirds: however, there are a few about as good\nas you will get them anywhere in Hammersmith this morning.\"\n\nRobert patted her on the head in a friendly manner; and we fell to on our\nbreakfast, which was simple enough, but most delicately cooked, and set\non the table with much daintiness.  The bread was particularly good, and\nwas of several different kinds, from the big, rather close,\ndark-coloured, sweet-tasting farmhouse loaf, which was most to my liking,\nto the thin pipe-stems of wheaten crust, such as I have eaten in Turin.\n\nAs I was putting the first mouthfuls into my mouth my eye caught a carved\nand gilded inscription on the panelling, behind what we should have\ncalled the High Table in an Oxford college hall, and a familiar name in\nit forced me to read it through.  Thus it ran:\n\n   \"_Guests and neighbours_, _on the site of this Guest-hall once stood\n   the lecture-room of the Hammersmith Socialists_.  _Drink a glass to\n   the memory_!  _May 1962_.\"\n\nIt is difficult to tell you how I felt as I read these words, and I\nsuppose my face showed how much I was moved, for both my friends looked\ncuriously at me, and there was silence between us for a little while.\n\nPresently the weaver, who was scarcely so well mannered a man as the\nferryman, said to me rather awkwardly:\n\n\"Guest, we don't know what to call you: is there any indiscretion in\nasking you your name?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I have some doubts about it myself; so suppose you call\nme Guest, which is a family name, you know, and add William to it if you\nplease.\"\n\nDick nodded kindly to me; but a shade of anxiousness passed over the\nweaver's face, and he said--\"I hope you don't mind my asking, but would\nyou tell me where you come from?  I am curious about such things for good\nreasons, literary reasons.\"\n\nDick was clearly kicking him underneath the table; but he was not much\nabashed, and awaited my answer somewhat eagerly.  As for me, I was just\ngoing to blurt out \"Hammersmith,\" when I bethought me what an\nentanglement of cross purposes that would lead us into; so I took time to\ninvent a lie with circumstance, guarded by a little truth, and said:\n\n\"You see, I have been such a long time away from Europe that things seem\nstrange to me now; but I was born and bred on the edge of Epping Forest;\nWalthamstow and Woodford, to wit.\"\n\n\"A pretty place, too,\" broke in Dick; \"a very jolly place, now that the\ntrees have had time to grow again since the great clearing of houses in\n1955.\"\n\nQuoth the irrepressible weaver: \"Dear neighbour, since you knew the\nForest some time ago, could you tell me what truth there is in the rumour\nthat in the nineteenth century the trees were all pollards?\"\n\nThis was catching me on my archaeological natural-history side, and I\nfell into the trap without any thought of where and when I was; so I\nbegan on it, while one of the girls, the handsome one, who had been\nscattering little twigs of lavender and other sweet-smelling herbs about\nthe floor, came near to listen, and stood behind me with her hand on my\nshoulder, in which she held some of the plant that I used to call balm:\nits strong sweet smell brought back to my mind my very early days in the\nkitchen-garden at Woodford, and the large blue plums which grew on the\nwall beyond the sweet-herb patch,--a connection of memories which all\nboys will see at once.\n\nI started off: \"When I was a boy, and for long after, except for a piece\nabout Queen Elizabeth's Lodge, and for the part about High Beech, the\nForest was almost wholly made up of pollard hornbeams mixed with holly\nthickets.  But when the Corporation of London took it over about twenty-\nfive years ago, the topping and lopping, which was a part of the old\ncommoners' rights, came to an end, and the trees were let to grow.  But I\nhave not seen the place now for many years, except once, when we Leaguers\nwent a pleasuring to High Beech.  I was very much shocked then to see how\nit was built-over and altered; and the other day we heard that the\nphilistines were going to landscape-garden it.  But what you were saying\nabout the building being stopped and the trees growing is only too good\nnews;--only you know--\"\n\nAt that point I suddenly remembered Dick's date, and stopped short rather\nconfused.  The eager weaver didn't notice my confusion, but said hastily,\nas if he were almost aware of his breach of good manners, \"But, I say,\nhow old are you?\"\n\nDick and the pretty girl both burst out laughing, as if Robert's conduct\nwere excusable on the grounds of eccentricity; and Dick said amidst his\nlaughter:\n\n\"Hold hard, Bob; this questioning of guests won't do.  Why, much learning\nis spoiling you.  You remind me of the radical cobblers in the silly old\nnovels, who, according to the authors, were prepared to trample down all\ngood manners in the pursuit of utilitarian knowledge.  The fact is, I\nbegin to think that you have so muddled your head with mathematics, and\nwith grubbing into those idiotic old books about political economy (he\nhe!), that you scarcely know how to behave.  Really, it is about time for\nyou to take to some open-air work, so that you may clear away the cobwebs\nfrom your brain.\"\n\nThe weaver only laughed good-humouredly; and the girl went up to him and\npatted his cheek and said laughingly, \"Poor fellow! he was born so.\"\n\nAs for me, I was a little puzzled, but I laughed also, partly for\ncompany's sake, and partly with pleasure at their unanxious happiness and\ngood temper; and before Robert could make the excuse to me which he was\ngetting ready, I said:\n\n\"But neighbours\" (I had caught up that word), \"I don't in the least mind\nanswering questions, when I can do so: ask me as many as you please; it's\nfun for me.  I will tell you all about Epping Forest when I was a boy, if\nyou please; and as to my age, I'm not a fine lady, you know, so why\nshouldn't I tell you?  I'm hard on fifty-six.\"\n\nIn spite of the recent lecture on good manners, the weaver could not help\ngiving a long \"whew\" of astonishment, and the others were so amused by\nhis _naivete_ that the merriment flitted all over their faces, though for\ncourtesy's sake they forbore actual laughter; while I looked from one to\nthe other in a puzzled manner, and at last said:\n\n\"Tell me, please, what is amiss: you know I want to learn from you.  And\nplease laugh; only tell me.\"\n\nWell, they _did_ laugh, and I joined them again, for the above-stated\nreasons.  But at last the pretty woman said coaxingly--\n\n\"Well, well, he _is_ rude, poor fellow! but you see I may as well tell\nyou what he is thinking about: he means that you look rather old for your\nage.  But surely there need be no wonder in that, since you have been\ntravelling; and clearly from all you have been saying, in unsocial\ncountries.  It has often been said, and no doubt truly, that one ages\nvery quickly if one lives amongst unhappy people.  Also they say that\nsouthern England is a good place for keeping good looks.\"  She blushed\nand said: \"How old am I, do you think?\"\n\n\"Well,\" quoth I, \"I have always been told that a woman is as old as she\nlooks, so without offence or flattery, I should say that you were\ntwenty.\"\n\nShe laughed merrily, and said, \"I am well served out for fishing for\ncompliments, since I have to tell you the truth, to wit, that I am forty-\ntwo.\"\n\nI stared at her, and drew musical laughter from her again; but I might\nwell stare, for there was not a careful line on her face; her skin was as\nsmooth as ivory, her cheeks full and round, her lips as red as the roses\nshe had brought in; her beautiful arms, which she had bared for her work,\nfirm and well-knit from shoulder to wrist.  She blushed a little under my\ngaze, though it was clear that she had taken me for a man of eighty; so\nto pass it off I said--\n\n\"Well, you see, the old saw is proved right again, and I ought not to\nhave let you tempt me into asking you a rude question.\"\n\nShe laughed again, and said: \"Well, lads, old and young, I must get to my\nwork now.  We shall be rather busy here presently; and I want to clear it\noff soon, for I began to read a pretty old book yesterday, and I want to\nget on with it this morning: so good-bye for the present.\"\n\nShe waved a hand to us, and stepped lightly down the hall, taking (as\nScott says) at least part of the sun from our table as she went.\n\nWhen she was gone, Dick said \"Now guest, won't you ask a question or two\nof our friend here?  It is only fair that you should have your turn.\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad to answer them,\" said the weaver.\n\n\"If I ask you any questions, sir,\" said I, \"they will not be very severe;\nbut since I hear that you are a weaver, I should like to ask you\nsomething about that craft, as I am--or was--interested in it.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said he, \"I shall not be of much use to you there, I'm afraid.  I\nonly do the most mechanical kind of weaving, and am in fact but a poor\ncraftsman, unlike Dick here.  Then besides the weaving, I do a little\nwith machine printing and composing, though I am little use at the finer\nkinds of printing; and moreover machine printing is beginning to die out,\nalong with the waning of the plague of book-making, so I have had to turn\nto other things that I have a taste for, and have taken to mathematics;\nand also I am writing a sort of antiquarian book about the peaceable and\nprivate history, so to say, of the end of the nineteenth century,--more\nfor the sake of giving a picture of the country before the fighting began\nthan for anything else.  That was why I asked you those questions about\nEpping Forest.  You have rather puzzled me, I confess, though your\ninformation was so interesting.  But later on, I hope, we may have some\nmore talk together, when our friend Dick isn't here.  I know he thinks me\nrather a grinder, and despises me for not being very deft with my hands:\nthat's the way nowadays.  From what I have read of the nineteenth century\nliterature (and I have read a good deal), it is clear to me that this is\na kind of revenge for the stupidity of that day, which despised everybody\nwho _could_ use his hands.  But Dick, old fellow, _Ne quid nimis_!  Don't\noverdo it!\"\n\n\"Come now,\" said Dick, \"am I likely to?  Am I not the most tolerant man\nin the world?  Am I not quite contented so long as you don't make me\nlearn mathematics, or go into your new science of aesthetics, and let me\ndo a little practical aesthetics with my gold and steel, and the blowpipe\nand the nice little hammer?  But, hillo! here comes another questioner\nfor you, my poor guest.  I say, Bob, you must help me to defend him now.\"\n\n\"Here, Boffin,\" he cried out, after a pause; \"here we are, if you must\nhave it!\"\n\nI looked over my shoulder, and saw something flash and gleam in the\nsunlight that lay across the hall; so I turned round, and at my ease saw\na splendid figure slowly sauntering over the pavement; a man whose\nsurcoat was embroidered most copiously as well as elegantly, so that the\nsun flashed back from him as if he had been clad in golden armour.  The\nman himself was tall, dark-haired, and exceedingly handsome, and though\nhis face was no less kindly in expression than that of the others, he\nmoved with that somewhat haughty mien which great beauty is apt to give\nto both men and women.  He came and sat down at our table with a smiling\nface, stretching out his long legs and hanging his arm over the chair in\nthe slowly graceful way which tall and well-built people may use without\naffectation.  He was a man in the prime of life, but looked as happy as a\nchild who has just got a new toy.  He bowed gracefully to me and said--\n\n\"I see clearly that you are the guest, of whom Annie has just told me,\nwho have come from some distant country that does not know of us, or our\nways of life.  So I daresay you would not mind answering me a few\nquestions; for you see--\"\n\nHere Dick broke in: \"No, please, Boffin! let it alone for the present.  Of\ncourse you want the guest to be happy and comfortable; and how can that\nbe if he has to trouble himself with answering all sorts of questions\nwhile he is still confused with the new customs and people about him?  No,\nno: I am going to take him where he can ask questions himself, and have\nthem answered; that is, to my great-grandfather in Bloomsbury: and I am\nsure you can't have anything to say against that.  So instead of\nbothering, you had much better go out to James Allen's and get a carriage\nfor me, as I shall drive him up myself; and please tell Jim to let me\nhave the old grey, for I can drive a wherry much better than a carriage.\nJump up, old fellow, and don't be disappointed; our guest will keep\nhimself for you and your stories.\"\n\nI stared at Dick; for I wondered at his speaking to such a\ndignified-looking personage so familiarly, not to say curtly; for I\nthought that this Mr. Boffin, in spite of his well-known name out of\nDickens, must be at the least a senator of these strange people.  However,\nhe got up and said, \"All right, old oar-wearer, whatever you like; this\nis not one of my busy days; and though\" (with a condescending bow to me)\n\"my pleasure of a talk with this learned guest is put off, I admit that\nhe ought to see your worthy kinsman as soon as possible.  Besides,\nperhaps he will be the better able to answer _my_ questions after his own\nhave been answered.\"\n\nAnd therewith he turned and swung himself out of the hall.\n\nWhen he was well gone, I said: \"Is it wrong to ask what Mr. Boffin is?\nwhose name, by the way, reminds me of many pleasant hours passed in\nreading Dickens.\"\n\nDick laughed.  \"Yes, yes,\" said he, \"as it does us.  I see you take the\nallusion.  Of course his real name is not Boffin, but Henry Johnson; we\nonly call him Boffin as a joke, partly because he is a dustman, and\npartly because he will dress so showily, and get as much gold on him as a\nbaron of the Middle Ages.  As why should he not if he likes? only we are\nhis special friends, you know, so of course we jest with him.\"\n\nI held my tongue for some time after that; but Dick went on:\n\n\"He is a capital fellow, and you can't help liking him; but he has a\nweakness: he will spend his time in writing reactionary novels, and is\nvery proud of getting the local colour right, as he calls it; and as he\nthinks you come from some forgotten corner of the earth, where people are\nunhappy, and consequently interesting to a story-teller, he thinks he\nmight get some information out of you.  O, he will be quite\nstraightforward with you, for that matter.  Only for your own comfort\nbeware of him!\"\n\n\"Well, Dick,\" said the weaver, doggedly, \"I think his novels are very\ngood.\"\n\n\"Of course you do,\" said Dick; \"birds of a feather flock together;\nmathematics and antiquarian novels stand on much the same footing.  But\nhere he comes again.\"\n\nAnd in effect the Golden Dustman hailed us from the hall-door; so we all\ngot up and went into the porch, before which, with a strong grey horse in\nthe shafts, stood a carriage ready for us which I could not help\nnoticing.  It was light and handy, but had none of that sickening\nvulgarity which I had known as inseparable from the carriages of our\ntime, especially the \"elegant\" ones, but was as graceful and pleasant in\nline as a Wessex waggon.  We got in, Dick and I.  The girls, who had come\ninto the porch to see us off, waved their hands to us; the weaver nodded\nkindly; the dustman bowed as gracefully as a troubadour; Dick shook the\nreins, and we were off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV: A MARKET BY THE WAY\n\n\nWe turned away from the river at once, and were soon in the main road\nthat runs through Hammersmith.  But I should have had no guess as to\nwhere I was, if I had not started from the waterside; for King Street was\ngone, and the highway ran through wide sunny meadows and garden-like\ntillage.  The Creek, which we crossed at once, had been rescued from its\nculvert, and as we went over its pretty bridge we saw its waters, yet\nswollen by the tide, covered with gay boats of different sizes.  There\nwere houses about, some on the road, some amongst the fields with\npleasant lanes leading down to them, and each surrounded by a teeming\ngarden.  They were all pretty in design, and as solid as might be, but\ncountryfied in appearance, like yeomen's dwellings; some of them of red\nbrick like those by the river, but more of timber and plaster, which were\nby the necessity of their construction so like mediaeval houses of the\nsame materials that I fairly felt as if I were alive in the fourteenth\ncentury; a sensation helped out by the costume of the people that we met\nor passed, in whose dress there was nothing \"modern.\"  Almost everybody\nwas gaily dressed, but especially the women, who were so well-looking, or\neven so handsome, that I could scarcely refrain my tongue from calling my\ncompanion's attention to the fact.  Some faces I saw that were\nthoughtful, and in these I noticed great nobility of expression, but none\nthat had a glimmer of unhappiness, and the greater part (we came upon a\ngood many people) were frankly and openly joyous.\n\nI thought I knew the Broadway by the lie of the roads that still met\nthere.  On the north side of the road was a range of buildings and\ncourts, low, but very handsomely built and ornamented, and in that way\nforming a great contrast to the unpretentiousness of the houses round\nabout; while above this lower building rose the steep lead-covered roof\nand the buttresses and higher part of the wall of a great hall, of a\nsplendid and exuberant style of architecture, of which one can say little\nmore than that it seemed to me to embrace the best qualities of the\nGothic of northern Europe with those of the Saracenic and Byzantine,\nthough there was no copying of any one of these styles.  On the other,\nthe south side, of the road was an octagonal building with a high roof,\nnot unlike the Baptistry at Florence in outline, except that it was\nsurrounded by a lean-to that clearly made an arcade or cloisters to it:\nit also was most delicately ornamented.\n\nThis whole mass of architecture which we had come upon so suddenly from\namidst the pleasant fields was not only exquisitely beautiful in itself,\nbut it bore upon it the expression of such generosity and abundance of\nlife that I was exhilarated to a pitch that I had never yet reached.  I\nfairly chuckled for pleasure.  My friend seemed to understand it, and sat\nlooking on me with a pleased and affectionate interest.  We had pulled up\namongst a crowd of carts, wherein sat handsome healthy-looking people,\nmen, women, and children very gaily dressed, and which were clearly\nmarket carts, as they were full of very tempting-looking country produce.\n\nI said, \"I need not ask if this is a market, for I see clearly that it\nis; but what market is it that it is so splendid?  And what is the\nglorious hall there, and what is the building on the south side?\"\n\n\"O,\" said he, \"it is just our Hammersmith market; and I am glad you like\nit so much, for we are really proud of it.  Of course the hall inside is\nour winter Mote-House; for in summer we mostly meet in the fields down by\nthe river opposite Barn Elms.  The building on our right hand is our\ntheatre: I hope you like it.\"\n\n\"I should be a fool if I didn't,\" said I.\n\nHe blushed a little as he said: \"I am glad of that, too, because I had a\nhand in it; I made the great doors, which are of damascened bronze.  We\nwill look at them later in the day, perhaps: but we ought to be getting\non now.  As to the market, this is not one of our busy days; so we shall\ndo better with it another time, because you will see more people.\"\n\nI thanked him, and said: \"Are these the regular country people?  What\nvery pretty girls there are amongst them.\"\n\nAs I spoke, my eye caught the face of a beautiful woman, tall,\ndark-haired, and white-skinned, dressed in a pretty light-green dress in\nhonour of the season and the hot day, who smiled kindly on me, and more\nkindly still, I thought on Dick; so I stopped a minute, but presently\nwent on:\n\n\"I ask because I do not see any of the country-looking people I should\nhave expected to see at a market--I mean selling things there.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said he, \"what kind of people you would expect to\nsee; nor quite what you mean by 'country' people.  These are the\nneighbours, and that like they run in the Thames valley.  There are parts\nof these islands which are rougher and rainier than we are here, and\nthere people are rougher in their dress; and they themselves are tougher\nand more hard-bitten than we are to look at.  But some people like their\nlooks better than ours; they say they have more character in them--that's\nthe word.  Well, it's a matter of taste.--Anyhow, the cross between us\nand them generally turns out well,\" added he, thoughtfully.\n\nI heard him, though my eyes were turned away from him, for that pretty\ngirl was just disappearing through the gate with her big basket of early\npeas, and I felt that disappointed kind of feeling which overtakes one\nwhen one has seen an interesting or lovely face in the streets which one\nis never likely to see again; and I was silent a little.  At last I said:\n\"What I mean is, that I haven't seen any poor people about--not one.\"\n\nHe knit his brows, looked puzzled, and said: \"No, naturally; if anybody\nis poorly, he is likely to be within doors, or at best crawling about the\ngarden: but I don't know of any one sick at present.  Why should you\nexpect to see poorly people on the road?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I said; \"I don't mean sick people.  I mean poor people, you\nknow; rough people.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he, smiling merrily, \"I really do not know.  The fact is, you\nmust come along quick to my great-grandfather, who will understand you\nbetter than I do.  Come on, Greylocks!\"  Therewith he shook the reins,\nand we jogged along merrily eastward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V: CHILDREN ON THE ROAD\n\n\nPast the Broadway there were fewer houses on either side.  We presently\ncrossed a pretty little brook that ran across a piece of land dotted over\nwith trees, and awhile after came to another market and town-hall, as we\nshould call it.  Although there was nothing familiar to me in its\nsurroundings, I knew pretty well where we were, and was not surprised\nwhen my guide said briefly, \"Kensington Market.\"\n\nJust after this we came into a short street of houses: or rather, one\nlong house on either side of the way, built of timber and plaster, and\nwith a pretty arcade over the footway before it.\n\nQuoth Dick: \"This is Kensington proper.  People are apt to gather here\nrather thick, for they like the romance of the wood; and naturalists\nhaunt it, too; for it is a wild spot even here, what there is of it; for\nit does not go far to the south: it goes from here northward and west\nright over Paddington and a little way down Notting Hill: thence it runs\nnorth-east to Primrose Hill, and so on; rather a narrow strip of it gets\nthrough Kingsland to Stoke-Newington and Clapton, where it spreads out\nalong the heights above the Lea marshes; on the other side of which, as\nyou know, is Epping Forest holding out a hand to it.  This part we are\njust coming to is called Kensington Gardens; though why 'gardens' I don't\nknow.\"\n\nI rather longed to say, \"Well, _I_ know\"; but there were so many things\nabout me which I did _not_ know, in spite of his assumptions, that I\nthought it better to hold my tongue.\n\nThe road plunged at once into a beautiful wood spreading out on either\nside, but obviously much further on the north side, where even the oaks\nand sweet chestnuts were of a good growth; while the quicker-growing\ntrees (amongst which I thought the planes and sycamores too numerous)\nwere very big and fine-grown.\n\nIt was exceedingly pleasant in the dappled shadow, for the day was\ngrowing as hot as need be, and the coolness and shade soothed my excited\nmind into a condition of dreamy pleasure, so that I felt as if I should\nlike to go on for ever through that balmy freshness.  My companion seemed\nto share in my feelings, and let the horse go slower and slower as he sat\ninhaling the green forest scents, chief amongst which was the smell of\nthe trodden bracken near the wayside.\n\nRomantic as this Kensington wood was, however, it was not lonely.  We\ncame on many groups both coming and going, or wandering in the edges of\nthe wood.  Amongst these were many children from six or eight years old\nup to sixteen or seventeen.  They seemed to me to be especially fine\nspecimens of their race, and enjoying themselves to the utmost; some of\nthem were hanging about little tents pitched on the greensward, and by\nsome of these fires were burning, with pots hanging over them gipsy\nfashion.  Dick explained to me that there were scattered houses in the\nforest, and indeed we caught a glimpse of one or two.  He said they were\nmostly quite small, such as used to be called cottages when there were\nslaves in the land, but they were pleasant enough and fitting for the\nwood.\n\n\"They must be pretty well stocked with children,\" said I, pointing to the\nmany youngsters about the way.\n\n\"O,\" said he, \"these children do not all come from the near houses, the\nwoodland houses, but from the country-side generally.  They often make up\nparties, and come to play in the woods for weeks together in summer-time,\nliving in tents, as you see.  We rather encourage them to it; they learn\nto do things for themselves, and get to notice the wild creatures; and,\nyou see, the less they stew inside houses the better for them.  Indeed, I\nmust tell you that many grown people will go to live in the forests\nthrough the summer; though they for the most part go to the bigger ones,\nlike Windsor, or the Forest of Dean, or the northern wastes.  Apart from\nthe other pleasures of it, it gives them a little rough work, which I am\nsorry to say is getting somewhat scarce for these last fifty years.\"\n\nHe broke off, and then said, \"I tell you all this, because I see that if\nI talk I must be answering questions, which you are thinking, even if you\nare not speaking them out; but my kinsman will tell you more about it.\"\n\nI saw that I was likely to get out of my depth again, and so merely for\nthe sake of tiding over an awkwardness and to say something, I said--\n\n\"Well, the youngsters here will be all the fresher for school when the\nsummer gets over and they have to go back again.\"\n\n\"School?\" he said; \"yes, what do you mean by that word?  I don't see how\nit can have anything to do with children.  We talk, indeed, of a school\nof herring, and a school of painting, and in the former sense we might\ntalk of a school of children--but otherwise,\" said he, laughing, \"I must\nown myself beaten.\"\n\nHang it! thought I, I can't open my mouth without digging up some new\ncomplexity.  I wouldn't try to set my friend right in his etymology; and\nI thought I had best say nothing about the boy-farms which I had been\nused to call schools, as I saw pretty clearly that they had disappeared;\nso I said after a little fumbling, \"I was using the word in the sense of\na system of education.\"\n\n\"Education?\" said he, meditatively, \"I know enough Latin to know that the\nword must come from _educere_, to lead out; and I have heard it used; but\nI have never met anybody who could give me a clear explanation of what it\nmeans.\"\n\nYou may imagine how my new friends fell in my esteem when I heard this\nfrank avowal; and I said, rather contemptuously, \"Well, education means a\nsystem of teaching young people.\"\n\n\"Why not old people also?\" said he with a twinkle in his eye.  \"But,\" he\nwent on, \"I can assure you our children learn, whether they go through a\n'system of teaching' or not.  Why, you will not find one of these\nchildren about here, boy or girl, who cannot swim; and every one of them\nhas been used to tumbling about the little forest ponies--there's one of\nthem now!  They all of them know how to cook; the bigger lads can mow;\nmany can thatch and do odd jobs at carpentering; or they know how to keep\nshop.  I can tell you they know plenty of things.\"\n\n\"Yes, but their mental education, the teaching of their minds,\" said I,\nkindly translating my phrase.\n\n\"Guest,\" said he, \"perhaps you have not learned to do these things I have\nbeen speaking about; and if that's the case, don't you run away with the\nidea that it doesn't take some skill to do them, and doesn't give plenty\nof work for one's mind: you would change your opinion if you saw a\nDorsetshire lad thatching, for instance.  But, however, I understand you\nto be speaking of book-learning; and as to that, it is a simple affair.\nMost children, seeing books lying about, manage to read by the time they\nare four years old; though I am told it has not always been so.  As to\nwriting, we do not encourage them to scrawl too early (though scrawl a\nlittle they will), because it gets them into a habit of ugly writing; and\nwhat's the use of a lot of ugly writing being done, when rough printing\ncan be done so easily.  You understand that handsome writing we like, and\nmany people will write their books out when they make them, or get them\nwritten; I mean books of which only a few copies are needed--poems, and\nsuch like, you know.  However, I am wandering from my lambs; but you must\nexcuse me, for I am interested in this matter of writing, being myself a\nfair-writer.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"about the children; when they know how to read and\nwrite, don't they learn something else--languages, for instance?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said; \"sometimes even before they can read, they can talk\nFrench, which is the nearest language talked on the other side of the\nwater; and they soon get to know German also, which is talked by a huge\nnumber of communes and colleges on the mainland.  These are the principal\nlanguages we speak in these islands, along with English or Welsh, or\nIrish, which is another form of Welsh; and children pick them up very\nquickly, because their elders all know them; and besides our guests from\nover sea often bring their children with them, and the little ones get\ntogether, and rub their speech into one another.\"\n\n\"And the older languages?\" said I.\n\n\"O, yes,\" said he, \"they mostly learn Latin and Greek along with the\nmodern ones, when they do anything more than merely pick up the latter.\"\n\n\"And history?\" said I; \"how do you teach history?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"when a person can read, of course he reads what he\nlikes to; and he can easily get someone to tell him what are the best\nbooks to read on such or such a subject, or to explain what he doesn't\nunderstand in the books when he is reading them.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"what else do they learn?  I suppose they don't all learn\nhistory?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said he; \"some don't care about it; in fact, I don't think many\ndo.  I have heard my great-grandfather say that it is mostly in periods\nof turmoil and strife and confusion that people care much about history;\nand you know,\" said my friend, with an amiable smile, \"we are not like\nthat now.  No; many people study facts about the make of things and the\nmatters of cause and effect, so that knowledge increases on us, if that\nbe good; and some, as you heard about friend Bob yonder, will spend time\nover mathematics.  'Tis no use forcing people's tastes.\"\n\nSaid I: \"But you don't mean that children learn all these things?\"\n\nSaid he: \"That depends on what you mean by children; and also you must\nremember how much they differ.  As a rule, they don't do much reading,\nexcept for a few story-books, till they are about fifteen years old; we\ndon't encourage early bookishness: though you will find some children who\n_will_ take to books very early; which perhaps is not good for them; but\nit's no use thwarting them; and very often it doesn't last long with\nthem, and they find their level before they are twenty years old.  You\nsee, children are mostly given to imitating their elders, and when they\nsee most people about them engaged in genuinely amusing work, like house-\nbuilding and street-paving, and gardening, and the like, that is what\nthey want to be doing; so I don't think we need fear having too many book-\nlearned men.\"\n\nWhat could I say?  I sat and held my peace, for fear of fresh\nentanglements.  Besides, I was using my eyes with all my might, wondering\nas the old horse jogged on, when I should come into London proper, and\nwhat it would be like now.\n\nBut my companion couldn't let his subject quite drop, and went on\nmeditatively:\n\n\"After all, I don't know that it does them much harm, even if they do\ngrow up book-students.  Such people as that, 'tis a great pleasure seeing\nthem so happy over work which is not much sought for.  And besides, these\nstudents are generally such pleasant people; so kind and sweet tempered;\nso humble, and at the same time so anxious to teach everybody all that\nthey know.  Really, I like those that I have met prodigiously.\"\n\nThis seemed to me such very queer talk that I was on the point of asking\nhim another question; when just as we came to the top of a rising ground,\ndown a long glade of the wood on my right I caught sight of a stately\nbuilding whose outline was familiar to me, and I cried out, \"Westminster\nAbbey!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, \"Westminster Abbey--what there is left of it.\"\n\n\"Why, what have you done with it?\" quoth I in terror.\n\n\"What have _we_ done with it?\" said he; \"nothing much, save clean it.  But\nyou know the whole outside was spoiled centuries ago: as to the inside,\nthat remains in its beauty after the great clearance, which took place\nover a hundred years ago, of the beastly monuments to fools and knaves,\nwhich once blocked it up, as great-grandfather says.\"\n\nWe went on a little further, and I looked to the right again, and said,\nin rather a doubtful tone of voice, \"Why, there are the Houses of\nParliament!  Do you still use them?\"\n\nHe burst out laughing, and was some time before he could control himself;\nthen he clapped me on the back and said:\n\n\"I take you, neighbour; you may well wonder at our keeping them standing,\nand I know something about that, and my old kinsman has given me books to\nread about the strange game that they played there.  Use them!  Well,\nyes, they are used for a sort of subsidiary market, and a storage place\nfor manure, and they are handy for that, being on the waterside.  I\nbelieve it was intended to pull them down quite at the beginning of our\ndays; but there was, I am told, a queer antiquarian society, which had\ndone some service in past times, and which straightway set up its pipe\nagainst their destruction, as it has done with many other buildings,\nwhich most people looked upon as worthless, and public nuisances; and it\nwas so energetic, and had such good reasons to give, that it generally\ngained its point; and I must say that when all is said I am glad of it:\nbecause you know at the worst these silly old buildings serve as a kind\nof foil to the beautiful ones which we build now.  You will see several\nothers in these parts; the place my great-grandfather lives in, for\ninstance, and a big building called St. Paul's.  And you see, in this\nmatter we need not grudge a few poorish buildings standing, because we\ncan always build elsewhere; nor need we be anxious as to the breeding of\npleasant work in such matters, for there is always room for more and more\nwork in a new building, even without making it pretentious.  For\ninstance, elbow-room _within_ doors is to me so delightful that if I were\ndriven to it I would most sacrifice outdoor space to it.  Then, of\ncourse, there is the ornament, which, as we must all allow, may easily be\noverdone in mere living houses, but can hardly be in mote-halls and\nmarkets, and so forth.  I must tell you, though, that my\ngreat-grandfather sometimes tells me I am a little cracked on this\nsubject of fine building; and indeed I _do_ think that the energies of\nmankind are chiefly of use to them for such work; for in that direction I\ncan see no end to the work, while in many others a limit does seem\npossible.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI: A LITTLE SHOPPING\n\n\nAs he spoke, we came suddenly out of the woodland into a short street of\nhandsomely built houses, which my companion named to me at once as\nPiccadilly: the lower part of these I should have called shops, if it had\nnot been that, as far as I could see, the people were ignorant of the\narts of buying and selling.  Wares were displayed in their finely\ndesigned fronts, as if to tempt people in, and people stood and looked at\nthem, or went in and came out with parcels under their arms, just like\nthe real thing.  On each side of the street ran an elegant arcade to\nprotect foot-passengers, as in some of the old Italian cities.  About\nhalfway down, a huge building of the kind I was now prepared to expect\ntold me that this also was a centre of some kind, and had its special\npublic buildings.\n\nSaid Dick: \"Here, you see, is another market on a different plan from\nmost others: the upper stories of these houses are used for guest-houses;\nfor people from all about the country are apt to drift up hither from\ntime to time, as folk are very thick upon the ground, which you will see\nevidence of presently, and there are people who are fond of crowds,\nthough I can't say that I am.\"\n\nI couldn't help smiling to see how long a tradition would last.  Here was\nthe ghost of London still asserting itself as a centre,--an intellectual\ncentre, for aught I knew.  However, I said nothing, except that I asked\nhim to drive very slowly, as the things in the booths looked exceedingly\npretty.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"this is a very good market for pretty things, and is\nmostly kept for the handsomer goods, as the Houses-of-Parliament market,\nwhere they set out cabbages and turnips and such like things, along with\nbeer and the rougher kind of wine, is so near.\"\n\nThen he looked at me curiously, and said, \"Perhaps you would like to do a\nlittle shopping, as 'tis called.\"\n\nI looked at what I could see of my rough blue duds, which I had plenty of\nopportunity of contrasting with the gay attire of the citizens we had\ncome across; and I thought that if, as seemed likely, I should presently\nbe shown about as a curiosity for the amusement of this most\nunbusinesslike people, I should like to look a little less like a\ndischarged ship's purser.  But in spite of all that had happened, my hand\nwent down into my pocket again, where to my dismay it met nothing\nmetallic except two rusty old keys, and I remembered that amidst our talk\nin the guest-hall at Hammersmith I had taken the cash out of my pocket to\nshow to the pretty Annie, and had left it lying there.  My face fell\nfifty per cent., and Dick, beholding me, said rather sharply--\n\n\"Hilloa, Guest! what's the matter now?  Is it a wasp?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, \"but I've left it behind.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"whatever you have left behind, you can get in this\nmarket again, so don't trouble yourself about it.\"\n\nI had come to my senses by this time, and remembering the astounding\ncustoms of this country, had no mind for another lecture on social\neconomy and the Edwardian coinage; so I said only--\n\n\"My clothes--Couldn't I?  You see--What do think could be done about\nthem?\"\n\nHe didn't seem in the least inclined to laugh, but said quite gravely:\n\n\"O don't get new clothes yet.  You see, my great-grandfather is an\nantiquarian, and he will want to see you just as you are.  And, you know,\nI mustn't preach to you, but surely it wouldn't be right for you to take\naway people's pleasure of studying your attire, by just going and making\nyourself like everybody else.  You feel that, don't you?\" said he,\nearnestly.\n\nI did _not_ feel it my duty to set myself up for a scarecrow amidst this\nbeauty-loving people, but I saw I had got across some ineradicable\nprejudice, and that it wouldn't do to quarrel with my new friend.  So I\nmerely said, \"O certainly, certainly.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, pleasantly, \"you may as well see what the inside of\nthese booths is like: think of something you want.\"\n\nSaid I: \"Could I get some tobacco and a pipe?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said he; \"what was I thinking of, not asking you before?\nWell, Bob is always telling me that we non-smokers are a selfish lot, and\nI'm afraid he is right.  But come along; here is a place just handy.\"\n\nTherewith he drew rein and jumped down, and I followed.  A very handsome\nwoman, splendidly clad in figured silk, was slowly passing by, looking\ninto the windows as she went.  To her quoth Dick: \"Maiden, would you\nkindly hold our horse while we go in for a little?\"  She nodded to us\nwith a kind smile, and fell to patting the horse with her pretty hand.\n\n\"What a beautiful creature!\" said I to Dick as we entered.\n\n\"What, old Greylocks?\" said he, with a sly grin.\n\n\"No, no,\" said I; \"Goldylocks,--the lady.\"\n\n\"Well, so she is,\" said he.  \"'Tis a good job there are so many of them\nthat every Jack may have his Jill: else I fear that we should get\nfighting for them.  Indeed,\" said he, becoming very grave, \"I don't say\nthat it does not happen even now, sometimes.  For you know love is not a\nvery reasonable thing, and perversity and self-will are commoner than\nsome of our moralists think.\"  He added, in a still more sombre tone:\n\"Yes, only a month ago there was a mishap down by us, that in the end\ncost the lives of two men and a woman, and, as it were, put out the\nsunlight for us for a while.  Don't ask me about it just now; I may tell\nyou about it later on.\"\n\nBy this time we were within the shop or booth, which had a counter, and\nshelves on the walls, all very neat, though without any pretence of\nshowiness, but otherwise not very different to what I had been used to.\nWithin were a couple of children--a brown-skinned boy of about twelve,\nwho sat reading a book, and a pretty little girl of about a year older,\nwho was sitting also reading behind the counter; they were obviously\nbrother and sister.\n\n\"Good morning, little neighbours,\" said Dick.  \"My friend here wants\ntobacco and a pipe; can you help him?\"\n\n\"O yes, certainly,\" said the girl with a sort of demure alertness which\nwas somewhat amusing.  The boy looked up, and fell to staring at my\noutlandish attire, but presently reddened and turned his head, as if he\nknew that he was not behaving prettily.\n\n\"Dear neighbour,\" said the girl, with the most solemn countenance of a\nchild playing at keeping shop, \"what tobacco is it you would like?\"\n\n\"Latakia,\" quoth I, feeling as if I were assisting at a child's game, and\nwondering whether I should get anything but make-believe.\n\nBut the girl took a dainty little basket from a shelf beside her, went to\na jar, and took out a lot of tobacco and put the filled basket down on\nthe counter before me, where I could both smell and see that it was\nexcellent Latakia.\n\n\"But you haven't weighed it,\" said I, \"and--and how much am I to take?\"\n\n\"Why,\" she said, \"I advise you to cram your bag, because you may be going\nwhere you can't get Latakia.  Where is your bag?\"\n\nI fumbled about, and at last pulled out my piece of cotton print which\ndoes duty with me for a tobacco pouch.  But the girl looked at it with\nsome disdain, and said--\n\n\"Dear neighbour, I can give you something much better than that cotton\nrag.\"  And she tripped up the shop and came back presently, and as she\npassed the boy whispered something in his ear, and he nodded and got up\nand went out.  The girl held up in her finger and thumb a red morocco\nbag, gaily embroidered, and said, \"There, I have chosen one for you, and\nyou are to have it: it is pretty, and will hold a lot.\"\n\nTherewith she fell to cramming it with the tobacco, and laid it down by\nme and said, \"Now for the pipe: that also you must let me choose for you;\nthere are three pretty ones just come in.\"\n\nShe disappeared again, and came back with a big-bowled pipe in her hand,\ncarved out of some hard wood very elaborately, and mounted in gold\nsprinkled with little gems.  It was, in short, as pretty and gay a toy as\nI had ever seen; something like the best kind of Japanese work, but\nbetter.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said I, when I set eyes on it, \"this is altogether too grand\nfor me, or for anybody but the Emperor of the World.  Besides, I shall\nlose it: I always lose my pipes.\"\n\nThe child seemed rather dashed, and said, \"Don't you like it, neighbour?\"\n\n\"O yes,\" I said, \"of course I like it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, take it,\" said she, \"and don't trouble about losing it.  What\nwill it matter if you do?  Somebody is sure to find it, and he will use\nit, and you can get another.\"\n\nI took it out of her hand to look at it, and while I did so, forgot my\ncaution, and said, \"But however am I to pay for such a thing as this?\"\n\nDick laid his hand on my shoulder as I spoke, and turning I met his eyes\nwith a comical expression in them, which warned me against another\nexhibition of extinct commercial morality; so I reddened and held my\ntongue, while the girl simply looked at me with the deepest gravity, as\nif I were a foreigner blundering in my speech, for she clearly didn't\nunderstand me a bit.\n\n\"Thank you so very much,\" I said at last, effusively, as I put the pipe\nin my pocket, not without a qualm of doubt as to whether I shouldn't find\nmyself before a magistrate presently.\n\n\"O, you are so very welcome,\" said the little lass, with an affectation\nof grown-up manners at their best which was very quaint.  \"It is such a\npleasure to serve dear old gentlemen like you; especially when one can\nsee at once that you have come from far over sea.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" quoth I, \"I have been a great traveller.\"\n\nAs I told this lie from pure politeness, in came the lad again, with a\ntray in his hands, on which I saw a long flask and two beautiful glasses.\n\"Neighbours,\" said the girl (who did all the talking, her brother being\nvery shy, clearly) \"please to drink a glass to us before you go, since we\ndo not have guests like this every day.\"\n\nTherewith the boy put the tray on the counter and solemnly poured out a\nstraw-coloured wine into the long bowls.  Nothing loth, I drank, for I\nwas thirsty with the hot day; and thinks I, I am yet in the world, and\nthe grapes of the Rhine have not yet lost their flavour; for if ever I\ndrank good Steinberg, I drank it that morning; and I made a mental note\nto ask Dick how they managed to make fine wine when there were no longer\nlabourers compelled to drink rot-gut instead of the fine wine which they\nthemselves made.\n\n\"Don't you drink a glass to us, dear little neighbours?\" said I.\n\n\"I don't drink wine,\" said the lass; \"I like lemonade better: but I wish\nyour health!\"\n\n\"And I like ginger-beer better,\" said the little lad.\n\nWell, well, thought I, neither have children's tastes changed much.  And\ntherewith we gave them good day and went out of the booth.\n\nTo my disappointment, like a change in a dream, a tall old man was\nholding our horse instead of the beautiful woman.  He explained to us\nthat the maiden could not wait, and that he had taken her place; and he\nwinked at us and laughed when he saw how our faces fell, so that we had\nnothing for it but to laugh also--\n\n\"Where are you going?\" said he to Dick.\n\n\"To Bloomsbury,\" said Dick.\n\n\"If you two don't want to be alone, I'll come with you,\" said the old\nman.\n\n\"All right,\" said Dick, \"tell me when you want to get down and I'll stop\nfor you.  Let's get on.\"\n\nSo we got under way again; and I asked if children generally waited on\npeople in the markets.  \"Often enough,\" said he, \"when it isn't a matter\nof dealing with heavy weights, but by no means always.  The children like\nto amuse themselves with it, and it is good for them, because they handle\na lot of diverse wares and get to learn about them, how they are made,\nand where they come from, and so on.  Besides, it is such very easy work\nthat anybody can do it.  It is said that in the early days of our epoch\nthere were a good many people who were hereditarily afflicted with a\ndisease called Idleness, because they were the direct descendants of\nthose who in the bad times used to force other people to work for\nthem--the people, you know, who are called slave-holders or employers of\nlabour in the history books.  Well, these Idleness-stricken people used\nto serve booths _all_ their time, because they were fit for so little.\nIndeed, I believe that at one time they were actually _compelled_ to do\nsome such work, because they, especially the women, got so ugly and\nproduced such ugly children if their disease was not treated sharply,\nthat the neighbours couldn't stand it.  However, I'm happy to say that\nall that is gone by now; the disease is either extinct, or exists in such\na mild form that a short course of aperient medicine carries it off.  It\nis sometimes called the Blue-devils now, or the Mulleygrubs.  Queer\nnames, ain't they?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, pondering much.  But the old man broke in:\n\n\"Yes, all that is true, neighbour; and I have seen some of those poor\nwomen grown old.  But my father used to know some of them when they were\nyoung; and he said that they were as little like young women as might be:\nthey had hands like bunches of skewers, and wretched little arms like\nsticks; and waists like hour-glasses, and thin lips and peaked noses and\npale cheeks; and they were always pretending to be offended at anything\nyou said or did to them.  No wonder they bore ugly children, for no one\nexcept men like them could be in love with them--poor things!\"\n\nHe stopped, and seemed to be musing on his past life, and then said:\n\n\"And do you know, neighbours, that once on a time people were still\nanxious about that disease of Idleness: at one time we gave ourselves a\ngreat deal of trouble in trying to cure people of it.  Have you not read\nany of the medical books on the subject?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I; for the old man was speaking to me.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"it was thought at the time that it was the survival of\nthe old mediaeval disease of leprosy: it seems it was very catching, for\nmany of the people afflicted by it were much secluded, and were waited\nupon by a special class of diseased persons queerly dressed up, so that\nthey might be known.  They wore amongst other garments, breeches made of\nworsted velvet, that stuff which used to be called plush some years ago.\"\n\nAll this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to have made\nthe old man talk more.  But Dick got rather restive under so much ancient\nhistory: besides, I suspect he wanted to keep me as fresh as he could for\nhis great-grandfather.  So he burst out laughing at last, and said:\n\"Excuse me, neighbours, but I can't help it.  Fancy people not liking to\nwork!--it's too ridiculous.  Why, even you like to work, old\nfellow--sometimes,\" said he, affectionately patting the old horse with\nthe whip.  \"What a queer disease! it may well be called Mulleygrubs!\"\n\nAnd he laughed out again most boisterously; rather too much so, I\nthought, for his usual good manners; and I laughed with him for company's\nsake, but from the teeth outward only; for _I_ saw nothing funny in\npeople not liking to work, as you may well imagine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII: TRAFALGAR SQUARE\n\n\nAnd now again I was busy looking about me, for we were quite clear of\nPiccadilly Market, and were in a region of elegantly-built much\nornamented houses, which I should have called villas if they had been\nugly and pretentious, which was very far from being the case.  Each house\nstood in a garden carefully cultivated, and running over with flowers.\nThe blackbirds were singing their best amidst the garden-trees, which,\nexcept for a bay here and there, and occasional groups of limes, seemed\nto be all fruit-trees: there were a great many cherry-trees, now all\nladen with fruit; and several times as we passed by a garden we were\noffered baskets of fine fruit by children and young girls.  Amidst all\nthese gardens and houses it was of course impossible to trace the sites\nof the old streets: but it seemed to me that the main roadways were the\nsame as of old.\n\nWe came presently into a large open space, sloping somewhat toward the\nsouth, the sunny site of which had been taken advantage of for planting\nan orchard, mainly, as I could see, of apricot-trees, in the midst of\nwhich was a pretty gay little structure of wood, painted and gilded, that\nlooked like a refreshment-stall.  From the southern side of the said\norchard ran a long road, chequered over with the shadow of tall old pear\ntrees, at the end of which showed the high tower of the Parliament House,\nor Dung Market.\n\nA strange sensation came over me; I shut my eyes to keep out the sight of\nthe sun glittering on this fair abode of gardens, and for a moment there\npassed before them a phantasmagoria of another day.  A great space\nsurrounded by tall ugly houses, with an ugly church at the corner and a\nnondescript ugly cupolaed building at my back; the roadway thronged with\na sweltering and excited crowd, dominated by omnibuses crowded with\nspectators.  In the midst a paved be-fountained square, populated only by\na few men dressed in blue, and a good many singularly ugly bronze images\n(one on the top of a tall column).  The said square guarded up to the\nedge of the roadway by a four-fold line of big men clad in blue, and\nacross the southern roadway the helmets of a band of horse-soldiers, dead\nwhite in the greyness of the chilly November afternoon--I opened my eyes\nto the sunlight again and looked round me, and cried out among the\nwhispering trees and odorous blossoms, \"Trafalgar Square!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, who had drawn rein again, \"so it is.  I don't wonder at\nyour finding the name ridiculous: but after all, it was nobody's business\nto alter it, since the name of a dead folly doesn't bite.  Yet sometimes\nI think we might have given it a name which would have commemorated the\ngreat battle which was fought on the spot itself in 1952,--that was\nimportant enough, if the historians don't lie.\"\n\n\"Which they generally do, or at least did,\" said the old man.  \"For\ninstance, what can you make of this, neighbours?  I have read a muddled\naccount in a book--O a stupid book--called James' Social Democratic\nHistory, of a fight which took place here in or about the year 1887 (I am\nbad at dates).  Some people, says this story, were going to hold a ward-\nmote here, or some such thing, and the Government of London, or the\nCouncil, or the Commission, or what not other barbarous half-hatched body\nof fools, fell upon these citizens (as they were then called) with the\narmed hand.  That seems too ridiculous to be true; but according to this\nversion of the story, nothing much came of it, which certainly _is_ too\nridiculous to be true.\"\n\n\"Well,\" quoth I, \"but after all your Mr. James is right so far, and it\n_is_ true; except that there was no fighting, merely unarmed and\npeaceable people attacked by ruffians armed with bludgeons.\"\n\n\"And they put up with that?\" said Dick, with the first unpleasant\nexpression I had seen on his good-tempered face.\n\nSaid I, reddening: \"We _had_ to put up with it; we couldn't help it.\"\n\nThe old man looked at me keenly, and said: \"You seem to know a great deal\nabout it, neighbour!  And is it really true that nothing came of it?\"\n\n\"This came of it,\" said I, \"that a good many people were sent to prison\nbecause of it.\"\n\n\"What, of the bludgeoners?\" said the old man.  \"Poor devils!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said I, \"of the bludgeoned.\"\n\nSaid the old man rather severely: \"Friend, I expect that you have been\nreading some rotten collection of lies, and have been taken in by it too\neasily.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" said I, \"what I have been saying is true.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I am sure you think so, neighbour,\" said the old man, \"but I\ndon't see why you should be so cocksure.\"\n\nAs I couldn't explain why, I held my tongue.  Meanwhile Dick, who had\nbeen sitting with knit brows, cogitating, spoke at last, and said gently\nand rather sadly:\n\n\"How strange to think that there have been men like ourselves, and living\nin this beautiful and happy country, who I suppose had feelings and\naffections like ourselves, who could yet do such dreadful things.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, in a didactic tone; \"yet after all, even those days were a\ngreat improvement on the days that had gone before them.  Have you not\nread of the Mediaeval period, and the ferocity of its criminal laws; and\nhow in those days men fairly seemed to have enjoyed tormenting their\nfellow men?--nay, for the matter of that, they made their God a tormentor\nand a jailer rather than anything else.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, \"there are good books on that period also, some of\nwhich I have read.  But as to the great improvement of the nineteenth\ncentury, I don't see it.  After all, the Mediaeval folk acted after their\nconscience, as your remark about their God (which is true) shows, and\nthey were ready to bear what they inflicted on others; whereas the\nnineteenth century ones were hypocrites, and pretended to be humane, and\nyet went on tormenting those whom they dared to treat so by shutting them\nup in prison, for no reason at all, except that they were what they\nthemselves, the prison-masters, had forced them to be.  O, it's horrible\nto think of!\"\n\n\"But perhaps,\" said I, \"they did not know what the prisons were like.\"\n\nDick seemed roused, and even angry.  \"More shame for them,\" said he,\n\"when you and I know it all these years afterwards.  Look you, neighbour,\nthey couldn't fail to know what a disgrace a prison is to the\nCommonwealth at the best, and that their prisons were a good step on\ntowards being at the worst.\"\n\nQuoth I: \"But have you no prisons at all now?\"\n\nAs soon as the words were out of my mouth, I felt that I had made a\nmistake, for Dick flushed red and frowned, and the old man looked\nsurprised and pained; and presently Dick said angrily, yet as if\nrestraining himself somewhat--\n\n\"Man alive! how can you ask such a question?  Have I not told you that we\nknow what a prison means by the undoubted evidence of really trustworthy\nbooks, helped out by our own imaginations?  And haven't you specially\ncalled me to notice that the people about the roads and streets look\nhappy? and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours\nwere shut up in prison, while they bore such things quietly?  And if\nthere were people in prison, you couldn't hide it from folk, like you may\nan occasional man-slaying; because that isn't done of set purpose, with a\nlot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison\nbusiness is.  Prisons, indeed!  O no, no, no!\"\n\nHe stopped, and began to cool down, and said in a kind voice: \"But\nforgive me!  I needn't be so hot about it, since there are _not_ any\nprisons: I'm afraid you will think the worse of me for losing my temper.\nOf course, you, coming from the outlands, cannot be expected to know\nabout these things.  And now I'm afraid I have made you feel\nuncomfortable.\"\n\nIn a way he had; but he was so generous in his heat, that I liked him the\nbetter for it, and I said:\n\n\"No, really 'tis all my fault for being so stupid.  Let me change the\nsubject, and ask you what the stately building is on our left just\nshowing at the end of that grove of plane-trees?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"that is an old building built before the middle of the\ntwentieth century, and as you see, in a queer fantastic style not over\nbeautiful; but there are some fine things inside it, too, mostly\npictures, some very old.  It is called the National Gallery; I have\nsometimes puzzled as to what the name means: anyhow, nowadays wherever\nthere is a place where pictures are kept as curiosities permanently it is\ncalled a National Gallery, perhaps after this one.  Of course there are a\ngood many of them up and down the country.\"\n\nI didn't try to enlighten him, feeling the task too heavy; but I pulled\nout my magnificent pipe and fell a-smoking, and the old horse jogged on\nagain.  As we went, I said:\n\n\"This pipe is a very elaborate toy, and you seem so reasonable in this\ncountry, and your architecture is so good, that I rather wonder at your\nturning out such trivialities.\"\n\nIt struck me as I spoke that this was rather ungrateful of me, after\nhaving received such a fine present; but Dick didn't seem to notice my\nbad manners, but said:\n\n\"Well, I don't know; it is a pretty thing, and since nobody need make\nsuch things unless they like, I don't see why they shouldn't make them,\nif they like.  Of course, if carvers were scarce they would all be busy\non the architecture, as you call it, and then these 'toys' (a good word)\nwould not be made; but since there are plenty of people who can carve--in\nfact, almost everybody, and as work is somewhat scarce, or we are afraid\nit may be, folk do not discourage this kind of petty work.\"\n\nHe mused a little, and seemed somewhat perturbed; but presently his face\ncleared, and he said: \"After all, you must admit that the pipe is a very\npretty thing, with the little people under the trees all cut so clean and\nsweet;--too elaborate for a pipe, perhaps, but--well, it is very pretty.\"\n\n\"Too valuable for its use, perhaps,\" said I.\n\n\"What's that?\" said he; \"I don't understand.\"\n\nI was just going in a helpless way to try to make him understand, when we\ncame by the gates of a big rambling building, in which work of some sort\nseemed going on.  \"What building is that?\" said I, eagerly; for it was a\npleasure amidst all these strange things to see something a little like\nwhat I was used to: \"it seems to be a factory.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I think I know what you mean, and that's what it is; but\nwe don't call them factories now, but Banded-workshops: that is, places\nwhere people collect who want to work together.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said I, \"power of some sort is used there?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said he.  \"Why should people collect together to use power,\nwhen they can have it at the places where they live, or hard by, any two\nor three of them; or any one, for the matter of that?  No; folk collect\nin these Banded-workshops to do hand-work in which working together is\nnecessary or convenient; such work is often very pleasant.  In there, for\ninstance, they make pottery and glass,--there, you can see the tops of\nthe furnaces.  Well, of course it's handy to have fair-sized ovens and\nkilns and glass-pots, and a good lot of things to use them for: though of\ncourse there are a good many such places, as it would be ridiculous if a\nman had a liking for pot-making or glass-blowing that he should have to\nlive in one place or be obliged to forego the work he liked.\"\n\n\"I see no smoke coming from the furnaces,\" said I.\n\n\"Smoke?\" said Dick; \"why should you see smoke?\"\n\nI held my tongue, and he went on: \"It's a nice place inside, though as\nplain as you see outside.  As to the crafts, throwing the clay must be\njolly work: the glass-blowing is rather a sweltering job; but some folk\nlike it very much indeed; and I don't much wonder: there is such a sense\nof power, when you have got deft in it, in dealing with the hot metal.  It\nmakes a lot of pleasant work,\" said he, smiling, \"for however much care\nyou take of such goods, break they will, one day or another, so there is\nalways plenty to do.\"\n\nI held my tongue and pondered.\n\nWe came just here on a gang of men road-mending which delayed us a\nlittle; but I was not sorry for it; for all I had seen hitherto seemed a\nmere part of a summer holiday; and I wanted to see how this folk would\nset to on a piece of real necessary work.  They had been resting, and had\nonly just begun work again as we came up; so that the rattle of the picks\nwas what woke me from my musing.  There were about a dozen of them,\nstrong young men, looking much like a boating party at Oxford would have\nlooked in the days I remembered, and not more troubled with their work:\ntheir outer raiment lay on the road-side in an orderly pile under the\nguardianship of a six-year-old boy, who had his arm thrown over the neck\nof a big mastiff, who was as happily lazy as if the summer-day had been\nmade for him alone.  As I eyed the pile of clothes, I could see the gleam\nof gold and silk embroidery on it, and judged that some of these workmen\nhad tastes akin to those of the Golden Dustman of Hammersmith.  Beside\nthem lay a good big basket that had hints about it of cold pie and wine:\na half dozen of young women stood by watching the work or the workers,\nboth of which were worth watching, for the latter smote great strokes and\nwere very deft in their labour, and as handsome clean-built fellows as\nyou might find a dozen of in a summer day.  They were laughing and\ntalking merrily with each other and the women, but presently their\nforeman looked up and saw our way stopped.  So he stayed his pick and\nsang out, \"Spell ho, mates! here are neighbours want to get past.\"\nWhereon the others stopped also, and, drawing around us, helped the old\nhorse by easing our wheels over the half undone road, and then, like men\nwith a pleasant task on hand, hurried back to their work, only stopping\nto give us a smiling good-day; so that the sound of the picks broke out\nagain before Greylocks had taken to his jog-trot.  Dick looked back over\nhis shoulder at them and said:\n\n\"They are in luck to-day: it's right down good sport trying how much pick-\nwork one can get into an hour; and I can see those neighbours know their\nbusiness well.  It is not a mere matter of strength getting on quickly\nwith such work; is it, guest?\"\n\n\"I should think not,\" said I, \"but to tell you the truth, I have never\ntried my hand at it.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said he gravely, \"that seems a pity; it is good work for\nhardening the muscles, and I like it; though I admit it is pleasanter the\nsecond week than the first.  Not that I am a good hand at it: the fellows\nused to chaff me at one job where I was working, I remember, and sing out\nto me, 'Well rowed, stroke!'  'Put your back into it, bow!'\"\n\n\"Not much of a joke,\" quoth I.\n\n\"Well,\" said Dick, \"everything seems like a joke when we have a pleasant\nspell of work on, and good fellows merry about us; we feels so happy, you\nknow.\"  Again I pondered silently.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII: AN OLD FRIEND\n\n\nWe now turned into a pleasant lane where the branches of great\nplane-trees nearly met overhead, but behind them lay low houses standing\nrather close together.\n\n\"This is Long Acre,\" quoth Dick; \"so there must once have been a\ncornfield here.  How curious it is that places change so, and yet keep\ntheir old names!  Just look how thick the houses stand! and they are\nstill going on building, look you!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"but I think the cornfields must have been built\nover before the middle of the nineteenth century.  I have heard that\nabout here was one of the thickest parts of the town.  But I must get\ndown here, neighbours; I have got to call on a friend who lives in the\ngardens behind this Long Acre.  Good-bye and good luck, Guest!\"\n\nAnd he jumped down and strode away vigorously, like a young man.\n\n\"How old should you say that neighbour will be?\" said I to Dick as we\nlost sight of him; for I saw that he was old, and yet he looked dry and\nsturdy like a piece of old oak; a type of old man I was not used to\nseeing.\n\n\"O, about ninety, I should say,\" said Dick.\n\n\"How long-lived your people must be!\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, \"certainly we have beaten the threescore-and-ten of the\nold Jewish proverb-book.  But then you see that was written of Syria, a\nhot dry country, where people live faster than in our temperate climate.\nHowever, I don't think it matters much, so long as a man is healthy and\nhappy while he _is_ alive.  But now, Guest, we are so near to my old\nkinsman's dwelling-place that I think you had better keep all future\nquestions for him.\"\n\nI nodded a yes; and therewith we turned to the left, and went down a\ngentle slope through some beautiful rose-gardens, laid out on what I took\nto be the site of Endell Street.  We passed on, and Dick drew rein an\ninstant as we came across a long straightish road with houses scantily\nscattered up and down it.  He waved his hand right and left, and said,\n\"Holborn that side, Oxford Road that.  This was once a very important\npart of the crowded city outside the ancient walls of the Roman and\nMediaeval burg: many of the feudal nobles of the Middle Ages, we are\ntold, had big houses on either side of Holborn.  I daresay you remember\nthat the Bishop of Ely's house is mentioned in Shakespeare's play of King\nRichard III.; and there are some remains of that still left.  However,\nthis road is not of the same importance, now that the ancient city is\ngone, walls and all.\"\n\nHe drove on again, while I smiled faintly to think how the nineteenth\ncentury, of which such big words have been said, counted for nothing in\nthe memory of this man, who read Shakespeare and had not forgotten the\nMiddle Ages.\n\nWe crossed the road into a short narrow lane between the gardens, and\ncame out again into a wide road, on one side of which was a great and\nlong building, turning its gables away from the highway, which I saw at\nonce was another public group.  Opposite to it was a wide space of\ngreenery, without any wall or fence of any kind.  I looked through the\ntrees and saw beyond them a pillared portico quite familiar to me--no\nless old a friend, in fact, than the British Museum.  It rather took my\nbreath away, amidst all the strange things I had seen; but I held my\ntongue and let Dick speak.  Said he:\n\n\"Yonder is the British Museum, where my great-grandfather mostly lives;\nso I won't say much about it.  The building on the left is the Museum\nMarket, and I think we had better turn in there for a minute or two; for\nGreylocks will be wanting his rest and his oats; and I suppose you will\nstay with my kinsman the greater part of the day; and to say the truth,\nthere may be some one there whom I particularly want to see, and perhaps\nhave a long talk with.\"\n\nHe blushed and sighed, not altogether with pleasure, I thought; so of\ncourse I said nothing, and he turned the horse under an archway which\nbrought us into a very large paved quadrangle, with a big sycamore tree\nin each corner and a plashing fountain in the midst.  Near the fountain\nwere a few market stalls, with awnings over them of gay striped linen\ncloth, about which some people, mostly women and children, were moving\nquietly, looking at the goods exposed there.  The ground floor of the\nbuilding round the quadrangle was occupied by a wide arcade or cloister,\nwhose fanciful but strong architecture I could not enough admire.  Here\nalso a few people were sauntering or sitting reading on the benches.\n\nDick said to me apologetically: \"Here as elsewhere there is little doing\nto-day; on a Friday you would see it thronged, and gay with people, and\nin the afternoon there is generally music about the fountain.  However, I\ndaresay we shall have a pretty good gathering at our mid-day meal.\"\n\nWe drove through the quadrangle and by an archway, into a large handsome\nstable on the other side, where we speedily stalled the old nag and made\nhim happy with horse-meat, and then turned and walked back again through\nthe market, Dick looking rather thoughtful, as it seemed to me.\n\nI noticed that people couldn't help looking at me rather hard, and\nconsidering my clothes and theirs, I didn't wonder; but whenever they\ncaught my eye they made me a very friendly sign of greeting.\n\nWe walked straight into the forecourt of the Museum, where, except that\nthe railings were gone, and the whispering boughs of the trees were all\nabout, nothing seemed changed; the very pigeons were wheeling about the\nbuilding and clinging to the ornaments of the pediment as I had seen them\nof old.\n\nDick seemed grown a little absent, but he could not forbear giving me an\narchitectural note, and said:\n\n\"It is rather an ugly old building, isn't it?  Many people have wanted to\npull it down and rebuild it: and perhaps if work does really get scarce\nwe may yet do so.  But, as my great grandfather will tell you, it would\nnot be quite a straightforward job; for there are wonderful collections\nin there of all kinds of antiquities, besides an enormous library with\nmany exceedingly beautiful books in it, and many most useful ones as\ngenuine records, texts of ancient works and the like; and the worry and\nanxiety, and even risk, there would be in moving all this has saved the\nbuildings themselves.  Besides, as we said before, it is not a bad thing\nto have some record of what our forefathers thought a handsome building.\nFor there is plenty of labour and material in it.\"\n\n\"I see there is,\" said I, \"and I quite agree with you.  But now hadn't we\nbetter make haste to see your great-grandfather?\"\n\nIn fact, I could not help seeing that he was rather dallying with the\ntime.  He said, \"Yes, we will go into the house in a minute.  My kinsman\nis too old to do much work in the Museum, where he was a custodian of the\nbooks for many years; but he still lives here a good deal; indeed I\nthink,\" said he, smiling, \"that he looks upon himself as a part of the\nbooks, or the books a part of him, I don't know which.\"\n\nHe hesitated a little longer, then flushing up, took my hand, and saying,\n\"Come along, then!\" led me toward the door of one of the old official\ndwellings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX: CONCERNING LOVE\n\n\n\"Your kinsman doesn't much care for beautiful building, then,\" said I, as\nwe entered the rather dreary classical house; which indeed was as bare as\nneed be, except for some big pots of the June flowers which stood about\nhere and there; though it was very clean and nicely whitewashed.\n\n\"O I don't know,\" said Dick, rather absently.  \"He is getting old,\ncertainly, for he is over a hundred and five, and no doubt he doesn't\ncare about moving.  But of course he could live in a prettier house if he\nliked: he is not obliged to live in one place any more than any one else.\nThis way, Guest.\"\n\nAnd he led the way upstairs, and opening a door we went into a fair-sized\nroom of the old type, as plain as the rest of the house, with a few\nnecessary pieces of furniture, and those very simple and even rude, but\nsolid and with a good deal of carving about them, well designed but\nrather crudely executed.  At the furthest corner of the room, at a desk\nnear the window, sat a little old man in a roomy oak chair, well\nbecushioned.  He was dressed in a sort of Norfolk jacket of blue serge\nworn threadbare, with breeches of the same, and grey worsted stockings.\nHe jumped up from his chair, and cried out in a voice of considerable\nvolume for such an old man, \"Welcome, Dick, my lad; Clara is here, and\nwill be more than glad to see you; so keep your heart up.\"\n\n\"Clara here?\" quoth Dick; \"if I had known, I would not have brought--At\nleast, I mean I would--\"\n\nHe was stuttering and confused, clearly because he was anxious to say\nnothing to make me feel one too many.  But the old man, who had not seen\nme at first, helped him out by coming forward and saying to me in a kind\ntone:\n\n\"Pray pardon me, for I did not notice that Dick, who is big enough to\nhide anybody, you know, had brought a friend with him.  A most hearty\nwelcome to you!  All the more, as I almost hope that you are going to\namuse an old man by giving him news from over sea, for I can see that you\nare come from over the water and far off countries.\"\n\nHe looked at me thoughtfully, almost anxiously, as he said in a changed\nvoice, \"Might I ask you where you come from, as you are so clearly a\nstranger?\"\n\nI said in an absent way: \"I used to live in England, and now I am come\nback again; and I slept last night at the Hammersmith Guest House.\"\n\nHe bowed gravely, but seemed, I thought, a little disappointed with my\nanswer.  As for me, I was now looking at him harder than good manners\nallowed of; perhaps; for in truth his face, dried-apple-like as it was,\nseemed strangely familiar to me; as if I had seen it before--in a looking-\nglass it might be, said I to myself.\n\n\"Well,\" said the old man, \"wherever you come from, you are come among\nfriends.  And I see my kinsman Richard Hammond has an air about him as if\nhe had brought you here for me to do something for you.  Is that so,\nDick?\"\n\nDick, who was getting still more absent-minded and kept looking uneasily\nat the door, managed to say, \"Well, yes, kinsman: our guest finds things\nmuch altered, and cannot understand it; nor can I; so I thought I would\nbring him to you, since you know more of all that has happened within the\nlast two hundred years than any body else does.--What's that?\"\n\nAnd he turned toward the door again.  We heard footsteps outside; the\ndoor opened, and in came a very beautiful young woman, who stopped short\non seeing Dick, and flushed as red as a rose, but faced him nevertheless.\nDick looked at her hard, and half reached out his hand toward her, and\nhis whole face quivered with emotion.\n\nThe old man did not leave them long in this shy discomfort, but said,\nsmiling with an old man's mirth:\n\n\"Dick, my lad, and you, my dear Clara, I rather think that we two\noldsters are in your way; for I think you will have plenty to say to each\nother.  You had better go into Nelson's room up above; I know he has gone\nout; and he has just been covering the walls all over with mediaeval\nbooks, so it will be pretty enough even for you two and your renewed\npleasure.\"\n\nThe girl reached out her hand to Dick, and taking his led him out of the\nroom, looking straight before her; but it was easy to see that her\nblushes came from happiness, not anger; as, indeed, love is far more self-\nconscious than wrath.\n\nWhen the door had shut on them the old man turned to me, still smiling,\nand said:\n\n\"Frankly, my dear guest, you will do me a great service if you are come\nto set my old tongue wagging.  My love of talk still abides with me, or\nrather grows on me; and though it is pleasant enough to see these\nyoungsters moving about and playing together so seriously, as if the\nwhole world depended on their kisses (as indeed it does somewhat), yet I\ndon't think my tales of the past interest them much.  The last harvest,\nthe last baby, the last knot of carving in the market-place, is history\nenough for them.  It was different, I think, when I was a lad, when we\nwere not so assured of peace and continuous plenty as we are now--Well,\nwell!  Without putting you to the question, let me ask you this: Am I to\nconsider you as an enquirer who knows a little of our modern ways of\nlife, or as one who comes from some place where the very foundations of\nlife are different from ours,--do you know anything or nothing about us?\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly and with growing wonder in his eyes as he spoke;\nand I answered in a low voice:\n\n\"I know only so much of your modern life as I could gather from using my\neyes on the way here from Hammersmith, and from asking some questions of\nRichard Hammond, most of which he could hardly understand.\"\n\nThe old man smiled at this.  \"Then,\" said he, \"I am to speak to you as--\"\n\n\"As if I were a being from another planet,\" said I.\n\nThe old man, whose name, by the bye, like his kinsman's, was Hammond,\nsmiled and nodded, and wheeling his seat round to me, bade me sit in a\nheavy oak chair, and said, as he saw my eyes fix on its curious carving:\n\n\"Yes, I am much tied to the past, my past, you understand.  These very\npieces of furniture belong to a time before my early days; it was my\nfather who got them made; if they had been done within the last fifty\nyears they would have been much cleverer in execution; but I don't think\nI should have liked them the better.  We were almost beginning again in\nthose days: and they were brisk, hot-headed times.  But you hear how\ngarrulous I am: ask me questions, ask me questions about anything, dear\nguest; since I must talk, make my talk profitable to you.\"\n\nI was silent for a minute, and then I said, somewhat nervously: \"Excuse\nme if I am rude; but I am so much interested in Richard, since he has\nbeen so kind to me, a perfect stranger, that I should like to ask a\nquestion about him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said old Hammond, \"if he were not 'kind', as you call it, to a\nperfect stranger he would be thought a strange person, and people would\nbe apt to shun him.  But ask on, ask on! don't be shy of asking.\"\n\nSaid I: \"That beautiful girl, is he going to be married to her?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"yes, he is.  He has been married to her once already,\nand now I should say it is pretty clear that he will be married to her\nagain.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" quoth I, wondering what that meant.\n\n\"Here is the whole tale,\" said old Hammond; \"a short one enough; and now\nI hope a happy one: they lived together two years the first time; were\nboth very young; and then she got it into her head that she was in love\nwith somebody else.  So she left poor Dick; I say _poor_ Dick, because he\nhad not found any one else.  But it did not last long, only about a year.\nThen she came to me, as she was in the habit of bringing her troubles to\nthe old carle, and asked me how Dick was, and whether he was happy, and\nall the rest of it.  So I saw how the land lay, and said that he was very\nunhappy, and not at all well; which last at any rate was a lie.  There,\nyou can guess the rest.  Clara came to have a long talk with me to-day,\nbut Dick will serve her turn much better.  Indeed, if he hadn't chanced\nin upon me to-day I should have had to have sent for him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said I.  \"Have they any children?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"two; they are staying with one of my daughters at\npresent, where, indeed, Clara has mostly been.  I wouldn't lose sight of\nher, as I felt sure they would come together again: and Dick, who is the\nbest of good fellows, really took the matter to heart.  You see, he had\nno other love to run to, as she had.  So I managed it all; as I have done\nwith such-like matters before.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said I, \"no doubt you wanted to keep them out of the Divorce Court:\nbut I suppose it often has to settle such matters.\"\n\n\"Then you suppose nonsense,\" said he.  \"I know that there used to be such\nlunatic affairs as divorce-courts: but just consider; all the cases that\ncame into them were matters of property quarrels: and I think, dear\nguest,\" said he, smiling, \"that though you do come from another planet,\nyou can see from the mere outside look of our world that quarrels about\nprivate property could not go on amongst us in our days.\"\n\nIndeed, my drive from Hammersmith to Bloomsbury, and all the quiet happy\nlife I had seen so many hints of; even apart from my shopping, would have\nbeen enough to tell me that \"the sacred rights of property,\" as we used\nto think of them, were now no more.  So I sat silent while the old man\ntook up the thread of the discourse again, and said:\n\n\"Well, then, property quarrels being no longer possible, what remains in\nthese matters that a court of law could deal with?  Fancy a court for\nenforcing a contract of passion or sentiment!  If such a thing were\nneeded as a _reductio ad absurdum_ of the enforcement of contract, such a\nfolly would do that for us.\"\n\nHe was silent again a little, and then said: \"You must understand once\nfor all that we have changed these matters; or rather, that our way of\nlooking at them has changed, as we have changed within the last two\nhundred years.  We do not deceive ourselves, indeed, or believe that we\ncan get rid of all the trouble that besets the dealings between the\nsexes.  We know that we must face the unhappiness that comes of man and\nwoman confusing the relations between natural passion, and sentiment, and\nthe friendship which, when things go well, softens the awakening from\npassing illusions: but we are not so mad as to pile up degradation on\nthat unhappiness by engaging in sordid squabbles about livelihood and\nposition, and the power of tyrannising over the children who have been\nthe results of love or lust.\"\n\nAgain he paused awhile, and again went on: \"Calf love, mistaken for a\nheroism that shall be lifelong, yet early waning into disappointment; the\ninexplicable desire that comes on a man of riper years to be the all-in-\nall to some one woman, whose ordinary human kindness and human beauty he\nhas idealised into superhuman perfection, and made the one object of his\ndesire; or lastly the reasonable longing of a strong and thoughtful man\nto become the most intimate friend of some beautiful and wise woman, the\nvery type of the beauty and glory of the world which we love so well,--as\nwe exult in all the pleasure and exaltation of spirit which goes with\nthese things, so we set ourselves to bear the sorrow which not unseldom\ngoes with them also; remembering those lines of the ancient poet (I quote\nroughly from memory one of the many translations of the nineteenth\ncentury):\n\n   'For this the Gods have fashioned man's grief and evil day\n   That still for man hereafter might be the tale and the lay.'\n\nWell, well, 'tis little likely anyhow that all tales shall be lacking, or\nall sorrow cured.\"\n\nHe was silent for some time, and I would not interrupt him.  At last he\nbegan again: \"But you must know that we of these generations are strong\nand healthy of body, and live easily; we pass our lives in reasonable\nstrife with nature, exercising not one side of ourselves only, but all\nsides, taking the keenest pleasure in all the life of the world.  So it\nis a point of honour with us not to be self-centred; not to suppose that\nthe world must cease because one man is sorry; therefore we should think\nit foolish, or if you will, criminal, to exaggerate these matters of\nsentiment and sensibility: we are no more inclined to eke out our\nsentimental sorrows than to cherish our bodily pains; and we recognise\nthat there are other pleasures besides love-making.  You must remember,\nalso, that we are long-lived, and that therefore beauty both in man and\nwoman is not so fleeting as it was in the days when we were burdened so\nheavily by self-inflicted diseases.  So we shake off these griefs in a\nway which perhaps the sentimentalists of other times would think\ncontemptible and unheroic, but which we think necessary and manlike.  As\non the other hand, therefore, we have ceased to be commercial in our love-\nmatters, so also we have ceased to be _artificially_ foolish.  The folly\nwhich comes by nature, the unwisdom of the immature man, or the older man\ncaught in a trap, we must put up with that, nor are we much ashamed of\nit; but to be conventionally sensitive or sentimental--my friend, I am\nold and perhaps disappointed, but at least I think we have cast off\n_some_ of the follies of the older world.\"\n\nHe paused, as if for some words of mine; but I held my peace: then he\nwent on: \"At least, if we suffer from the tyranny and fickleness of\nnature or our own want of experience, we neither grimace about it, nor\nlie.  If there must be sundering betwixt those who meant never to sunder,\nso it must be: but there need be no pretext of unity when the reality of\nit is gone: nor do we drive those who well know that they are incapable\nof it to profess an undying sentiment which they cannot really feel: thus\nit is that as that monstrosity of venal lust is no longer possible, so\nalso it is no longer needed.  Don't misunderstand me.  You did not seemed\nshocked when I told you that there were no law-courts to enforce\ncontracts of sentiment or passion; but so curiously are men made, that\nperhaps you will be shocked when I tell you that there is no code of\npublic opinion which takes the place of such courts, and which might be\nas tyrannical and unreasonable as they were.  I do not say that people\ndon't judge their neighbours' conduct, sometimes, doubtless, unfairly.\nBut I do say that there is no unvarying conventional set of rules by\nwhich people are judged; no bed of Procrustes to stretch or cramp their\nminds and lives; no hypocritical excommunication which people are\n_forced_ to pronounce, either by unconsidered habit, or by the\nunexpressed threat of the lesser interdict if they are lax in their\nhypocrisy.  Are you shocked now?\"\n\n\"N-o--no,\" said I, with some hesitation.  \"It is all so different.\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" said he, \"one thing I think I can answer for: whatever\nsentiment there is, it is real--and general; it is not confined to people\nvery specially refined.  I am also pretty sure, as I hinted to you just\nnow, that there is not by a great way as much suffering involved in these\nmatters either to men or to women as there used to be.  But excuse me for\nbeing so prolix on this question!  You know you asked to be treated like\na being from another planet.\"\n\n\"Indeed I thank you very much,\" said I.  \"Now may I ask you about the\nposition of women in your society?\"\n\nHe laughed very heartily for a man of his years, and said: \"It is not\nwithout reason that I have got a reputation as a careful student of\nhistory.  I believe I really do understand 'the Emancipation of Women\nmovement' of the nineteenth century.  I doubt if any other man now alive\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said I, a little bit nettled by his merriment.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"of course you will see that all that is a dead\ncontroversy now.  The men have no longer any opportunity of tyrannising\nover the women, or the women over the men; both of which things took\nplace in those old times.  The women do what they can do best, and what\nthey like best, and the men are neither jealous of it or injured by it.\nThis is such a commonplace that I am almost ashamed to state it.\"\n\nI said, \"O; and legislation? do they take any part in that?\"\n\nHammond smiled and said: \"I think you may wait for an answer to that\nquestion till we get on to the subject of legislation.  There may be\nnovelties to you in that subject also.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said; \"but about this woman question?  I saw at the Guest\nHouse that the women were waiting on the men: that seems a little like\nreaction doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Does it?\" said the old man; \"perhaps you think housekeeping an\nunimportant occupation, not deserving of respect.  I believe that was the\nopinion of the 'advanced' women of the nineteenth century, and their male\nbackers.  If it is yours, I recommend to your notice an old Norwegian\nfolk-lore tale called How the Man minded the House, or some such title;\nthe result of which minding was that, after various tribulations, the man\nand the family cow balanced each other at the end of a rope, the man\nhanging halfway up the chimney, the cow dangling from the roof, which,\nafter the fashion of the country, was of turf and sloping down low to the\nground.  Hard on the cow, _I_ think.  Of course no such mishap could\nhappen to such a superior person as yourself,\" he added, chuckling.\n\nI sat somewhat uneasy under this dry gibe.  Indeed, his manner of\ntreating this latter part of the question seemed to me a little\ndisrespectful.\n\n\"Come, now, my friend,\" quoth he, \"don't you know that it is a great\npleasure to a clever woman to manage a house skilfully, and to do it so\nthat all the house-mates about her look pleased, and are grateful to her?\nAnd then, you know, everybody likes to be ordered about by a pretty\nwoman: why, it is one of the pleasantest forms of flirtation.  You are\nnot so old that you cannot remember that.  Why, I remember it well.\"\n\nAnd the old fellow chuckled again, and at last fairly burst out laughing.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said he, after a while; \"I am not laughing at anything you\ncould be thinking of; but at that silly nineteenth-century fashion,\ncurrent amongst rich so-called cultivated people, of ignoring all the\nsteps by which their daily dinner was reached, as matters too low for\ntheir lofty intelligence.  Useless idiots!  Come, now, I am a 'literary\nman,' as we queer animals used to be called, yet I am a pretty good cook\nmyself.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said he, \"I really think you can understand me better than\nyou would seem to do, judging by your words and your silence.\"\n\nSaid I: \"Perhaps that is so; but people putting in practice commonly this\nsense of interest in the ordinary occupations of life rather startles me.\nI will ask you a question or two presently about that.  But I want to\nreturn to the position of women amongst you.  You have studied the\n'emancipation of women' business of the nineteenth century: don't you\nremember that some of the 'superior' women wanted to emancipate the more\nintelligent part of their sex from the bearing of children?\"\n\nThe old man grew quite serious again.  Said he: \"I _do_ remember about\nthat strange piece of baseless folly, the result, like all other follies\nof the period, of the hideous class tyranny which then obtained.  What do\nwe think of it now? you would say.  My friend, that is a question easy to\nanswer.  How could it possibly be but that maternity should be highly\nhonoured amongst us?  Surely it is a matter of course that the natural\nand necessary pains which the mother must go through form a bond of union\nbetween man and woman, an extra stimulus to love and affection between\nthem, and that this is universally recognised.  For the rest, remember\nthat all the _artificial_ burdens of motherhood are now done away with.  A\nmother has no longer any mere sordid anxieties for the future of her\nchildren.  They may indeed turn out better or worse; they may disappoint\nher highest hopes; such anxieties as these are a part of the mingled\npleasure and pain which goes to make up the life of mankind.  But at\nleast she is spared the fear (it was most commonly the certainty) that\nartificial disabilities would make her children something less than men\nand women: she knows that they will live and act according to the measure\nof their own faculties.  In times past, it is clear that the 'Society' of\nthe day helped its Judaic god, and the 'Man of Science' of the time, in\nvisiting the sins of the fathers upon the children.  How to reverse this\nprocess, how to take the sting out of heredity, has for long been one of\nthe most constant cares of the thoughtful men amongst us.  So that, you\nsee, the ordinarily healthy woman (and almost all our women are both\nhealthy and at least comely), respected as a child-bearer and rearer of\nchildren, desired as a woman, loved as a companion, unanxious for the\nfuture of her children, has far more instinct for maternity than the poor\ndrudge and mother of drudges of past days could ever have had; or than\nher sister of the upper classes, brought up in affected ignorance of\nnatural facts, reared in an atmosphere of mingled prudery and prurience.\"\n\n\"You speak warmly,\" I said, \"but I can see that you are right.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"and I will point out to you a token of all the benefits\nwhich we have gained by our freedom.  What did you think of the looks of\nthe people whom you have come across to-day?\"\n\nSaid I: \"I could hardly have believed that there could be so many good-\nlooking people in any civilised country.\"\n\nHe crowed a little, like the old bird he was.  \"What! are we still\ncivilised?\" said he.  \"Well, as to our looks, the English and Jutish\nblood, which on the whole is predominant here, used not to produce much\nbeauty.  But I think we have improved it.  I know a man who has a large\ncollection of portraits printed from photographs of the nineteenth\ncentury, and going over those and comparing them with the everyday faces\nin these times, puts the improvement in our good looks beyond a doubt.\nNow, there are some people who think it not too fantastic to connect this\nincrease of beauty directly with our freedom and good sense in the\nmatters we have been speaking of: they believe that a child born from the\nnatural and healthy love between a man and a woman, even if that be\ntransient, is likely to turn out better in all ways, and especially in\nbodily beauty, than the birth of the respectable commercial marriage bed,\nor of the dull despair of the drudge of that system.  They say, Pleasure\nbegets pleasure.  What do you think?\"\n\n\"I am much of that mind,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n\n\n\"Well,\" said the old man, shifting in his chair, \"you must get on with\nyour questions, Guest; I have been some time answering this first one.\"\n\nSaid I: \"I want an extra word or two about your ideas of education;\nalthough I gathered from Dick that you let your children run wild and\ndidn't teach them anything; and in short, that you have so refined your\neducation, that now you have none.\"\n\n\"Then you gathered left-handed,\" quoth he.  \"But of course I understand\nyour point of view about education, which is that of times past, when\n'the struggle for life,' as men used to phrase it (_i.e._, the struggle\nfor a slave's rations on one side, and for a bouncing share of the slave-\nholders' privilege on the other), pinched 'education' for most people\ninto a niggardly dole of not very accurate information; something to be\nswallowed by the beginner in the art of living whether he liked it or\nnot, and was hungry for it or not: and which had been chewed and digested\nover and over again by people who didn't care about it in order to serve\nit out to other people who didn't care about it.\"\n\nI stopped the old man's rising wrath by a laugh, and said: \"Well, _you_\nwere not taught that way, at any rate, so you may let your anger run off\nyou a little.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" said he, smiling.  \"I thank you for correcting my\nill-temper: I always fancy myself as living in any period of which we may\nbe speaking.  But, however, to put it in a cooler way: you expected to\nsee children thrust into schools when they had reached an age\nconventionally supposed to be the due age, whatever their varying\nfaculties and dispositions might be, and when there, with like disregard\nto facts to be subjected to a certain conventional course of 'learning.'\nMy friend, can't you see that such a proceeding means ignoring the fact\nof _growth_, bodily and mental?  No one could come out of such a mill\nuninjured; and those only would avoid being crushed by it who would have\nthe spirit of rebellion strong in them.  Fortunately most children have\nhad that at all times, or I do not know that we should ever have reached\nour present position.  Now you see what it all comes to.  In the old\ntimes all this was the result of _poverty_.  In the nineteenth century,\nsociety was so miserably poor, owing to the systematised robbery on which\nit was founded, that real education was impossible for anybody.  The\nwhole theory of their so-called education was that it was necessary to\nshove a little information into a child, even if it were by means of\ntorture, and accompanied by twaddle which it was well known was of no\nuse, or else he would lack information lifelong: the hurry of poverty\nforbade anything else.  All that is past; we are no longer hurried, and\nthe information lies ready to each one's hand when his own inclinations\nimpel him to seek it.  In this as in other matters we have become\nwealthy: we can afford to give ourselves time to grow.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"but suppose the child, youth, man, never wants the\ninformation, never grows in the direction you might hope him to do:\nsuppose, for instance, he objects to learning arithmetic or mathematics;\nyou can't force him when he _is_ grown; can't you force him while he is\ngrowing, and oughtn't you to do so?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"were you forced to learn arithmetic and mathematics?\"\n\n\"A little,\" said I.\n\n\"And how old are you now?\"\n\n\"Say fifty-six,\" said I.\n\n\"And how much arithmetic and mathematics do you know now?\" quoth the old\nman, smiling rather mockingly.\n\nSaid I: \"None whatever, I am sorry to say.\"\n\nHammond laughed quietly, but made no other comment on my admission, and I\ndropped the subject of education, perceiving him to be hopeless on that\nside.\n\nI thought a little, and said: \"You were speaking just now of households:\nthat sounded to me a little like the customs of past times; I should have\nthought you would have lived more in public.\"\n\n\"Phalangsteries, eh?\" said he.  \"Well, we live as we like, and we like to\nlive as a rule with certain house-mates that we have got used to.\nRemember, again, that poverty is extinct, and that the Fourierist\nphalangsteries and all their kind, as was but natural at the time,\nimplied nothing but a refuge from mere destitution.  Such a way of life\nas that, could only have been conceived of by people surrounded by the\nworst form of poverty.  But you must understand therewith, that though\nseparate households are the rule amongst us, and though they differ in\ntheir habits more or less, yet no door is shut to any good-tempered\nperson who is content to live as the other house-mates do: only of course\nit would be unreasonable for one man to drop into a household and bid the\nfolk of it to alter their habits to please him, since he can go elsewhere\nand live as he pleases.  However, I need not say much about all this, as\nyou are going up the river with Dick, and will find out for yourself by\nexperience how these matters are managed.\"\n\nAfter a pause, I said: \"Your big towns, now; how about them?  London,\nwhich--which I have read about as the modern Babylon of civilization,\nseems to have disappeared.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said old Hammond, \"perhaps after all it is more like\nancient Babylon now than the 'modern Babylon' of the nineteenth century\nwas.  But let that pass.  After all, there is a good deal of population\nin places between here and Hammersmith; nor have you seen the most\npopulous part of the town yet.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then,\" said I, \"how is it towards the east?\"\n\nSaid he: \"Time was when if you mounted a good horse and rode straight\naway from my door here at a round trot for an hour and a half; you would\nstill be in the thick of London, and the greater part of that would be\n'slums,' as they were called; that is to say, places of torture for\ninnocent men and women; or worse, stews for rearing and breeding men and\nwomen in such degradation that that torture should seem to them mere\nordinary and natural life.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" I said, rather impatiently.  \"That was what was; tell\nme something of what is.  Is any of that left?\"\n\n\"Not an inch,\" said he; \"but some memory of it abides with us, and I am\nglad of it.  Once a year, on May-day, we hold a solemn feast in those\neasterly communes of London to commemorate The Clearing of Misery, as it\nis called.  On that day we have music and dancing, and merry games and\nhappy feasting on the site of some of the worst of the old slums, the\ntraditional memory of which we have kept.  On that occasion the custom is\nfor the prettiest girls to sing some of the old revolutionary songs, and\nthose which were the groans of the discontent, once so hopeless, on the\nvery spots where those terrible crimes of class-murder were committed day\nby day for so many years.  To a man like me, who have studied the past so\ndiligently, it is a curious and touching sight to see some beautiful\ngirl, daintily clad, and crowned with flowers from the neighbouring\nmeadows, standing amongst the happy people, on some mound where of old\ntime stood the wretched apology for a house, a den in which men and women\nlived packed amongst the filth like pilchards in a cask; lived in such a\nway that they could only have endured it, as I said just now, by being\ndegraded out of humanity--to hear the terrible words of threatening and\nlamentation coming from her sweet and beautiful lips, and she unconscious\nof their real meaning: to hear her, for instance, singing Hood's Song of\nthe Shirt, and to think that all the time she does not understand what it\nis all about--a tragedy grown inconceivable to her and her listeners.\nThink of that, if you can, and of how glorious life is grown!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said I, \"it is difficult for me to think of it.\"\n\nAnd I sat watching how his eyes glittered, and how the fresh life seemed\nto glow in his face, and I wondered how at his age he should think of the\nhappiness of the world, or indeed anything but his coming dinner.\n\n\"Tell me in detail,\" said I, \"what lies east of Bloomsbury now?\"\n\nSaid he: \"There are but few houses between this and the outer part of the\nold city; but in the city we have a thickly-dwelling population.  Our\nforefathers, in the first clearing of the slums, were not in a hurry to\npull down the houses in what was called at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury the business quarter of the town, and what later got to be known\nas the Swindling Kens.  You see, these houses, though they stood\nhideously thick on the ground, were roomy and fairly solid in building,\nand clean, because they were not used for living in, but as mere gambling\nbooths; so the poor people from the cleared slums took them for lodgings\nand dwelt there, till the folk of those days had time to think of\nsomething better for them; so the buildings were pulled down so gradually\nthat people got used to living thicker on the ground there than in most\nplaces; therefore it remains the most populous part of London, or perhaps\nof all these islands.  But it is very pleasant there, partly because of\nthe splendour of the architecture, which goes further than what you will\nsee elsewhere.  However, this crowding, if it may be called so, does not\ngo further than a street called Aldgate, a name which perhaps you may\nhave heard of.  Beyond that the houses are scattered wide about the\nmeadows there, which are very beautiful, especially when you get on to\nthe lovely river Lea (where old Isaak Walton used to fish, you know)\nabout the places called Stratford and Old Ford, names which of course you\nwill not have heard of, though the Romans were busy there once upon a\ntime.\"\n\nNot heard of them! thought I to myself.  How strange! that I who had seen\nthe very last remnant of the pleasantness of the meadows by the Lea\ndestroyed, should have heard them spoken of with pleasantness come back\nto them in full measure.\n\nHammond went on: \"When you get down to the Thames side you come on the\nDocks, which are works of the nineteenth century, and are still in use,\nalthough not so thronged as they once were, since we discourage\ncentralisation all we can, and we have long ago dropped the pretension to\nbe the market of the world.  About these Docks are a good few houses,\nwhich, however, are not inhabited by many people permanently; I mean,\nthose who use them come and go a good deal, the place being too low and\nmarshy for pleasant dwelling.  Past the Docks eastward and landward it is\nall flat pasture, once marsh, except for a few gardens, and there are\nvery few permanent dwellings there: scarcely anything but a few sheds,\nand cots for the men who come to look after the great herds of cattle\npasturing there.  But however, what with the beasts and the men, and the\nscattered red-tiled roofs and the big hayricks, it does not make a bad\nholiday to get a quiet pony and ride about there on a sunny afternoon of\nautumn, and look over the river and the craft passing up and down, and on\nto Shooters' Hill and the Kentish uplands, and then turn round to the\nwide green sea of the Essex marsh-land, with the great domed line of the\nsky, and the sun shining down in one flood of peaceful light over the\nlong distance.  There is a place called Canning's Town, and further out,\nSilvertown, where the pleasant meadows are at their pleasantest:\ndoubtless they were once slums, and wretched enough.\"\n\nThe names grated on my ear, but I could not explain why to him.  So I\nsaid: \"And south of the river, what is it like?\"\n\nHe said: \"You would find it much the same as the land about Hammersmith.\nNorth, again, the land runs up high, and there is an agreeable and well-\nbuilt town called Hampstead, which fitly ends London on that side.  It\nlooks down on the north-western end of the forest you passed through.\"\n\nI smiled.  \"So much for what was once London,\" said I.  \"Now tell me\nabout the other towns of the country.\"\n\nHe said: \"As to the big murky places which were once, as we know, the\ncentres of manufacture, they have, like the brick and mortar desert of\nLondon, disappeared; only, since they were centres of nothing but\n'manufacture,' and served no purpose but that of the gambling market,\nthey have left less signs of their existence than London.  Of course, the\ngreat change in the use of mechanical force made this an easy matter, and\nsome approach to their break-up as centres would probably have taken\nplace, even if we had not changed our habits so much: but they being such\nas they were, no sacrifice would have seemed too great a price to pay for\ngetting rid of the 'manufacturing districts,' as they used to be called.\nFor the rest, whatever coal or mineral we need is brought to grass and\nsent whither it is needed with as little as possible of dirt, confusion,\nand the distressing of quiet people's lives.  One is tempted to believe\nfrom what one has read of the condition of those districts in the\nnineteenth century, that those who had them under their power worried,\nbefouled, and degraded men out of malice prepense: but it was not so;\nlike the mis-education of which we were talking just now, it came of\ntheir dreadful poverty.  They were obliged to put up with everything, and\neven pretend that they liked it; whereas we can now deal with things\nreasonably, and refuse to be saddled with what we do not want.\"\n\nI confess I was not sorry to cut short with a question his glorifications\nof the age he lived in.  Said I: \"How about the smaller towns?  I suppose\nyou have swept those away entirely?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said he, \"it hasn't gone that way.  On the contrary, there has\nbeen but little clearance, though much rebuilding, in the smaller towns.\nTheir suburbs, indeed, when they had any, have melted away into the\ngeneral country, and space and elbow-room has been got in their centres:\nbut there are the towns still with their streets and squares and market-\nplaces; so that it is by means of these smaller towns that we of to-day\ncan get some kind of idea of what the towns of the older world were\nlike;--I mean to say at their best.\"\n\n\"Take Oxford, for instance,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I suppose Oxford was beautiful even in the nineteenth\ncentury.  At present it has the great interest of still preserving a\ngreat mass of pre-commercial building, and is a very beautiful place, yet\nthere are many towns which have become scarcely less beautiful.\"\n\nSaid I: \"In passing, may I ask if it is still a place of learning?\"\n\n\"Still?\" said he, smiling.  \"Well, it has reverted to some of its best\ntraditions; so you may imagine how far it is from its nineteenth-century\nposition.  It is real learning, knowledge cultivated for its own sake--the\nArt of Knowledge, in short--which is followed there, not the Commercial\nlearning of the past.  Though perhaps you do not know that in the\nnineteenth century Oxford and its less interesting sister Cambridge\nbecame definitely commercial.  They (and especially Oxford) were the\nbreeding places of a peculiar class of parasites, who called themselves\ncultivated people; they were indeed cynical enough, as the so-called\neducated classes of the day generally were; but they affected an\nexaggeration of cynicism in order that they might be thought knowing and\nworldly-wise.  The rich middle classes (they had no relation with the\nworking classes) treated them with the kind of contemptuous toleration\nwith which a mediaeval baron treated his jester; though it must be said\nthat they were by no means so pleasant as the old jesters were, being, in\nfact, _the_ bores of society.  They were laughed at, despised--and paid.\nWhich last was what they aimed at.\"\n\nDear me! thought I, how apt history is to reverse contemporary judgments.\nSurely only the worst of them were as bad as that.  But I must admit that\nthey were mostly prigs, and that they _were_ commercial.  I said aloud,\nthough more to myself than to Hammond, \"Well, how could they be better\nthan the age that made them?\"\n\n\"True,\" he said, \"but their pretensions were higher.\"\n\n\"Were they?\" said I, smiling.\n\n\"You drive me from corner to corner,\" said he, smiling in turn.  \"Let me\nsay at least that they were a poor sequence to the aspirations of Oxford\nof 'the barbarous Middle Ages.'\"\n\n\"Yes, that will do,\" said I.\n\n\"Also,\" said Hammond, \"what I have been saying of them is true in the\nmain.  But ask on!\"\n\nI said: \"We have heard about London and the manufacturing districts and\nthe ordinary towns: how about the villages?\"\n\nSaid Hammond: \"You must know that toward the end of the nineteenth\ncentury the villages were almost destroyed, unless where they became mere\nadjuncts to the manufacturing districts, or formed a sort of minor\nmanufacturing districts themselves.  Houses were allowed to fall into\ndecay and actual ruin; trees were cut down for the sake of the few\nshillings which the poor sticks would fetch; the building became\ninexpressibly mean and hideous.  Labour was scarce; but wages fell\nnevertheless.  All the small country arts of life which once added to the\nlittle pleasures of country people were lost.  The country produce which\npassed through the hands of the husbandmen never got so far as their\nmouths.  Incredible shabbiness and niggardly pinching reigned over the\nfields and acres which, in spite of the rude and careless husbandry of\nthe times, were so kind and bountiful.  Had you any inkling of all this?\"\n\n\"I have heard that it was so,\" said I \"but what followed?\"\n\n\"The change,\" said Hammond, \"which in these matters took place very early\nin our epoch, was most strangely rapid.  People flocked into the country\nvillages, and, so to say, flung themselves upon the freed land like a\nwild beast upon his prey; and in a very little time the villages of\nEngland were more populous than they had been since the fourteenth\ncentury, and were still growing fast.  Of course, this invasion of the\ncountry was awkward to deal with, and would have created much misery, if\nthe folk had still been under the bondage of class monopoly.  But as it\nwas, things soon righted themselves.  People found out what they were fit\nfor, and gave up attempting to push themselves into occupations in which\nthey must needs fail.  The town invaded the country; but the invaders,\nlike the warlike invaders of early days, yielded to the influence of\ntheir surroundings, and became country people; and in their turn, as they\nbecame more numerous than the townsmen, influenced them also; so that the\ndifference between town and country grew less and less; and it was indeed\nthis world of the country vivified by the thought and briskness of town-\nbred folk which has produced that happy and leisurely but eager life of\nwhich you have had a first taste.  Again I say, many blunders were made,\nbut we have had time to set them right.  Much was left for the men of my\nearlier life to deal with.  The crude ideas of the first half of the\ntwentieth century, when men were still oppressed by the fear of poverty,\nand did not look enough to the present pleasure of ordinary daily life,\nspoilt a great deal of what the commercial age had left us of external\nbeauty: and I admit that it was but slowly that men recovered from the\ninjuries that they inflicted on themselves even after they became free.\nBut slowly as the recovery came, it _did_ come; and the more you see of\nus, the clearer it will be to you that we are happy.  That we live amidst\nbeauty without any fear of becoming effeminate; that we have plenty to\ndo, and on the whole enjoy doing it.  What more can we ask of life?\"\n\nHe paused, as if he were seeking for words with which to express his\nthought.  Then he said:\n\n\"This is how we stand.  England was once a country of clearings amongst\nthe woods and wastes, with a few towns interspersed, which were\nfortresses for the feudal army, markets for the folk, gathering places\nfor the craftsmen.  It then became a country of huge and foul workshops\nand fouler gambling-dens, surrounded by an ill-kept, poverty-stricken\nfarm, pillaged by the masters of the workshops.  It is now a garden,\nwhere nothing is wasted and nothing is spoilt, with the necessary\ndwellings, sheds, and workshops scattered up and down the country, all\ntrim and neat and pretty.  For, indeed, we should be too much ashamed of\nourselves if we allowed the making of goods, even on a large scale, to\ncarry with it the appearance, even, of desolation and misery.  Why, my\nfriend, those housewives we were talking of just now would teach us\nbetter than that.\"\n\nSaid I: \"This side of your change is certainly for the better.  But\nthough I shall soon see some of these villages, tell me in a word or two\nwhat they are like, just to prepare me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said he, \"you have seen a tolerable picture of these villages\nas they were before the end of the nineteenth century.  Such things\nexist.\"\n\n\"I have seen several of such pictures,\" said I.\n\n\"Well,\" said Hammond, \"our villages are something like the best of such\nplaces, with the church or mote-house of the neighbours for their chief\nbuilding.  Only note that there are no tokens of poverty about them: no\ntumble-down picturesque; which, to tell you the truth, the artist usually\navailed himself of to veil his incapacity for drawing architecture.  Such\nthings do not please us, even when they indicate no misery.  Like the\nmediaevals, we like everything trim and clean, and orderly and bright; as\npeople always do when they have any sense of architectural power; because\nthen they know that they can have what they want, and they won't stand\nany nonsense from Nature in their dealings with her.\"\n\n\"Besides the villages, are there any scattered country houses?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, plenty,\" said Hammond; \"in fact, except in the wastes and forests\nand amongst the sand-hills (like Hindhead in Surrey), it is not easy to\nbe out of sight of a house; and where the houses are thinly scattered\nthey run large, and are more like the old colleges than ordinary houses\nas they used to be.  That is done for the sake of society, for a good\nmany people can dwell in such houses, as the country dwellers are not\nnecessarily husbandmen; though they almost all help in such work at\ntimes.  The life that goes on in these big dwellings in the country is\nvery pleasant, especially as some of the most studious men of our time\nlive in them, and altogether there is a great variety of mind and mood to\nbe found in them which brightens and quickens the society there.\"\n\n\"I am rather surprised,\" said I, \"by all this, for it seems to me that\nafter all the country must be tolerably populous.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said he; \"the population is pretty much the same as it was\nat the end of the nineteenth century; we have spread it, that is all.  Of\ncourse, also, we have helped to populate other countries--where we were\nwanted and were called for.\"\n\nSaid I: \"One thing, it seems to me, does not go with your word of\n'garden' for the country.  You have spoken of wastes and forests, and I\nmyself have seen the beginning of your Middlesex and Essex forest.  Why\ndo you keep such things in a garden? and isn't it very wasteful to do\nso?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"we like these pieces of wild nature, and can\nafford them, so we have them; let alone that as to the forests, we need a\ngreat deal of timber, and suppose that our sons and sons' sons will do\nthe like.  As to the land being a garden, I have heard that they used to\nhave shrubberies and rockeries in gardens once; and though I might not\nlike the artificial ones, I assure you that some of the natural rockeries\nof our garden are worth seeing.  Go north this summer and look at the\nCumberland and Westmoreland ones,--where, by the way, you will see some\nsheep-feeding, so that they are not so wasteful as you think; not so\nwasteful as forcing-grounds for fruit out of season, _I_ think.  Go and\nhave a look at the sheep-walks high up the slopes between Ingleborough\nand Pen-y-gwent, and tell me if you think we _waste_ the land there by\nnot covering it with factories for making things that nobody wants, which\nwas the chief business of the nineteenth century.\"\n\n\"I will try to go there,\" said I.\n\n\"It won't take much trying,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI: CONCERNING GOVERNMENT\n\n\n\"Now,\" said I, \"I have come to the point of asking questions which I\nsuppose will be dry for you to answer and difficult for you to explain;\nbut I have foreseen for some time past that I must ask them, will I 'nill\nI.  What kind of a government have you?  Has republicanism finally\ntriumphed? or have you come to a mere dictatorship, which some persons in\nthe nineteenth century used to prophesy as the ultimate outcome of\ndemocracy?  Indeed, this last question does not seem so very\nunreasonable, since you have turned your Parliament House into a dung-\nmarket.  Or where do you house your present Parliament?\"\n\nThe old man answered my smile with a hearty laugh, and said: \"Well, well,\ndung is not the worst kind of corruption; fertility may come of that,\nwhereas mere dearth came from the other kind, of which those walls once\nheld the great supporters.  Now, dear guest, let me tell you that our\npresent parliament would be hard to house in one place, because the whole\npeople is our parliament.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said I.\n\n\"No, I suppose not,\" said he.  \"I must now shock you by telling you that\nwe have no longer anything which you, a native of another planet, would\ncall a government.\"\n\n\"I am not so much shocked as you might think,\" said I, \"as I know\nsomething about governments.  But tell me, how do you manage, and how\nhave you come to this state of things?\"\n\nSaid he: \"It is true that we have to make some arrangements about our\naffairs, concerning which you can ask presently; and it is also true that\neverybody does not always agree with the details of these arrangements;\nbut, further, it is true that a man no more needs an elaborate system of\ngovernment, with its army, navy, and police, to force him to give way to\nthe will of the majority of his _equals_, than he wants a similar\nmachinery to make him understand that his head and a stone wall cannot\noccupy the same space at the same moment.  Do you want further\nexplanation?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I do,\" quoth I.\n\nOld Hammond settled himself in his chair with a look of enjoyment which\nrather alarmed me, and made me dread a scientific disquisition: so I\nsighed and abided.  He said:\n\n\"I suppose you know pretty well what the process of government was in the\nbad old times?\"\n\n\"I am supposed to know,\" said I.\n\n(Hammond)  What was the government of those days?  Was it really the\nParliament or any part of it?\n\n(I)  No.\n\n(H.)  Was not the Parliament on the one side a kind of watch-committee\nsitting to see that the interests of the Upper Classes took no hurt; and\non the other side a sort of blind to delude the people into supposing\nthat they had some share in the management of their own affairs?\n\n(I)  History seems to show us this.\n\n(H.)  To what extent did the people manage their own affairs?\n\n(I)  I judge from what I have heard that sometimes they forced the\nParliament to make a law to legalise some alteration which had already\ntaken place.\n\n(H.)  Anything else?\n\n(I)  I think not.  As I am informed, if the people made any attempt to\ndeal with the _cause_ of their grievances, the law stepped in and said,\nthis is sedition, revolt, or what not, and slew or tortured the\nringleaders of such attempts.\n\n(H.)  If Parliament was not the government then, nor the people either,\nwhat was the government?\n\n(I)  Can you tell me?\n\n(H.)  I think we shall not be far wrong if we say that government was the\nLaw-Courts, backed up by the executive, which handled the brute force\nthat the deluded people allowed them to use for their own purposes; I\nmean the army, navy, and police.\n\n(I)  Reasonable men must needs think you are right.\n\n(H.)  Now as to those Law-Courts.  Were they places of fair dealing\naccording to the ideas of the day?  Had a poor man a good chance of\ndefending his property and person in them?\n\n(I)  It is a commonplace that even rich men looked upon a law-suit as a\ndire misfortune, even if they gained the case; and as for a poor one--why,\nit was considered a miracle of justice and beneficence if a poor man who\nhad once got into the clutches of the law escaped prison or utter ruin.\n\n(H.)  It seems, then, my son, that the government by law-courts and\npolice, which was the real government of the nineteenth century, was not\na great success even to the people of that day, living under a class\nsystem which proclaimed inequality and poverty as the law of God and the\nbond which held the world together.\n\n(I)  So it seems, indeed.\n\n(H.)  And now that all this is changed, and the \"rights of property,\"\nwhich mean the clenching the fist on a piece of goods and crying out to\nthe neighbours, You shan't have this!--now that all this has disappeared\nso utterly that it is no longer possible even to jest upon its absurdity,\nis such a Government possible?\n\n(I)  It is impossible.\n\n(H.)  Yes, happily.  But for what other purpose than the protection of\nthe rich from the poor, the strong from the weak, did this Government\nexist?\n\n(I.)  I have heard that it was said that their office was to defend their\nown citizens against attack from other countries.\n\n(H.)  It was said; but was anyone expected to believe this?  For\ninstance, did the English Government defend the English citizen against\nthe French?\n\n(I)  So it was said.\n\n(H.)  Then if the French had invaded England and conquered it, they would\nnot have allowed the English workmen to live well?\n\n(I, laughing)  As far as I can make out, the English masters of the\nEnglish workmen saw to that: they took from their workmen as much of\ntheir livelihood as they dared, because they wanted it for themselves.\n\n(H.)  But if the French had conquered, would they not have taken more\nstill from the English workmen?\n\n(I)  I do not think so; for in that case the English workmen would have\ndied of starvation; and then the French conquest would have ruined the\nFrench, just as if the English horses and cattle had died of\nunder-feeding.  So that after all, the English _workmen_ would have been\nno worse off for the conquest: their French Masters could have got no\nmore from them than their English masters did.\n\n(H.)  This is true; and we may admit that the pretensions of the\ngovernment to defend the poor (_i.e._, the useful) people against other\ncountries come to nothing.  But that is but natural; for we have seen\nalready that it was the function of government to protect the rich\nagainst the poor.  But did not the government defend its rich men against\nother nations?\n\n(I)  I do not remember to have heard that the rich needed defence;\nbecause it is said that even when two nations were at war, the rich men\nof each nation gambled with each other pretty much as usual, and even\nsold each other weapons wherewith to kill their own countrymen.\n\n(H.)  In short, it comes to this, that whereas the so-called government\nof protection of property by means of the law-courts meant destruction of\nwealth, this defence of the citizens of one country against those of\nanother country by means of war or the threat of war meant pretty much\nthe same thing.\n\n(I)  I cannot deny it.\n\n(H.)  Therefore the government really existed for the destruction of\nwealth?\n\n(I)  So it seems.  And yet--\n\n(H.)  Yet what?\n\n(I)  There were many rich people in those times.\n\n(H.)  You see the consequences of that fact?\n\n(I)  I think I do.  But tell me out what they were.\n\n(H.)  If the government habitually destroyed wealth, the country must\nhave been poor?\n\n(I)  Yes, certainly.\n\n(H.)  Yet amidst this poverty the persons for the sake of whom the\ngovernment existed insisted on being rich whatever might happen?\n\n(I)  So it was.\n\n(H.)  What must happen if in a poor country some people insist on being\nrich at the expense of the others?\n\n(I)  Unutterable poverty for the others.  All this misery, then, was\ncaused by the destructive government of which we have been speaking?\n\n(H.)  Nay, it would be incorrect to say so.  The government itself was\nbut the necessary result of the careless, aimless tyranny of the times;\nit was but the machinery of tyranny.  Now tyranny has come to an end, and\nwe no longer need such machinery; we could not possibly use it since we\nare free.  Therefore in your sense of the word we have no government.  Do\nyou understand this now?\n\n(I)  Yes, I do.  But I will ask you some more questions as to how you as\nfree men manage your affairs.\n\n(H.)  With all my heart.  Ask away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII: CONCERNING THE ARRANGEMENT OF LIFE\n\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"about those 'arrangements' which you spoke of as taking\nthe place of government, could you give me any account of them?\"\n\n\"Neighbour,\" he said, \"although we have simplified our lives a great deal\nfrom what they were, and have got rid of many conventionalities and many\nsham wants, which used to give our forefathers much trouble, yet our life\nis too complex for me to tell you in detail by means of words how it is\narranged; you must find that out by living amongst us.  It is true that I\ncan better tell you what we don't do, than what we do do.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said I.\n\n\"This is the way to put it,\" said he: \"We have been living for a hundred\nand fifty years, at least, more or less in our present manner, and a\ntradition or habit of life has been growing on us; and that habit has\nbecome a habit of acting on the whole for the best.  It is easy for us to\nlive without robbing each other.  It would be possible for us to contend\nwith and rob each other, but it would be harder for us than refraining\nfrom strife and robbery.  That is in short the foundation of our life and\nour happiness.\"\n\n\"Whereas in the old days,\" said I, \"it was very hard to live without\nstrife and robbery.  That's what you mean, isn't it, by giving me the\nnegative side of your good conditions?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"it was so hard, that those who habitually acted fairly\nto their neighbours were celebrated as saints and heroes, and were looked\nup to with the greatest reverence.\"\n\n\"While they were alive?\" said I.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"after they were dead.\"\n\n\"But as to these days,\" I said; \"you don't mean to tell me that no one\never transgresses this habit of good fellowship?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Hammond, \"but when the transgressions occur,\neverybody, transgressors and all, know them for what they are; the errors\nof friends, not the habitual actions of persons driven into enmity\nagainst society.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said I; \"you mean that you have no 'criminal' classes.\"\n\n\"How could we have them,\" said he, \"since there is no rich class to breed\nenemies against the state by means of the injustice of the state?\"\n\nSaid I: \"I thought that I understood from something that fell from you a\nlittle while ago that you had abolished civil law.  Is that so,\nliterally?\"\n\n\"It abolished itself, my friend,\" said he.  \"As I said before, the civil\nlaw-courts were upheld for the defence of private property; for nobody\never pretended that it was possible to make people act fairly to each\nother by means of brute force.  Well, private property being abolished,\nall the laws and all the legal 'crimes' which it had manufactured of\ncourse came to an end.  Thou shalt not steal, had to be translated into,\nThou shalt work in order to live happily.  Is there any need to enforce\nthat commandment by violence?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"that is understood, and I agree with it; but how about\ncrimes of violence? would not their occurrence (and you admit that they\noccur) make criminal law necessary?\"\n\nSaid he: \"In your sense of the word, we have no criminal law either.  Let\nus look at the matter closer, and see whence crimes of violence spring.\nBy far the greater part of these in past days were the result of the laws\nof private property, which forbade the satisfaction of their natural\ndesires to all but a privileged few, and of the general visible coercion\nwhich came of those laws.  All that cause of violent crime is gone.\nAgain, many violent acts came from the artificial perversion of the\nsexual passions, which caused overweening jealousy and the like miseries.\nNow, when you look carefully into these, you will find that what lay at\nthe bottom of them was mostly the idea (a law-made idea) of the woman\nbeing the property of the man, whether he were husband, father, brother,\nor what not.  That idea has of course vanished with private property, as\nwell as certain follies about the 'ruin' of women for following their\nnatural desires in an illegal way, which of course was a convention\ncaused by the laws of private property.\n\n\"Another cognate cause of crimes of violence was the family tyranny,\nwhich was the subject of so many novels and stories of the past, and\nwhich once more was the result of private property.  Of course that is\nall ended, since families are held together by no bond of coercion, legal\nor social, but by mutual liking and affection, and everybody is free to\ncome or go as he or she pleases.  Furthermore, our standards of honour\nand public estimation are very different from the old ones; success in\nbesting our neighbours is a road to renown now closed, let us hope for\never.  Each man is free to exercise his special faculty to the utmost,\nand every one encourages him in so doing.  So that we have got rid of the\nscowling envy, coupled by the poets with hatred, and surely with good\nreason; heaps of unhappiness and ill-blood were caused by it, which with\nirritable and passionate men--_i.e._, energetic and active men--often led\nto violence.\"\n\nI laughed, and said: \"So that you now withdraw your admission, and say\nthat there is no violence amongst you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"I withdraw nothing; as I told you, such things will\nhappen.  Hot blood will err sometimes.  A man may strike another, and the\nstricken strike back again, and the result be a homicide, to put it at\nthe worst.  But what then?  Shall we the neighbours make it worse still?\nShall we think so poorly of each other as to suppose that the slain man\ncalls on us to revenge him, when we know that if he had been maimed, he\nwould, when in cold blood and able to weigh all the circumstances, have\nforgiven his manner?  Or will the death of the slayer bring the slain man\nto life again and cure the unhappiness his loss has caused?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"but consider, must not the safety of society be\nsafeguarded by some punishment?\"\n\n\"There, neighbour!\" said the old man, with some exultation \"You have hit\nthe mark.  That _punishment_ of which men used to talk so wisely and act\nso foolishly, what was it but the expression of their fear?  And they had\nneed to fear, since they--_i.e._, the rulers of society--were dwelling\nlike an armed band in a hostile country.  But we who live amongst our\nfriends need neither fear nor punish.  Surely if we, in dread of an\noccasional rare homicide, an occasional rough blow, were solemnly and\nlegally to commit homicide and violence, we could only be a society of\nferocious cowards.  Don't you think so, neighbour?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, when I come to think of it from that side,\" said I.\n\n\"Yet you must understand,\" said the old man, \"that when any violence is\ncommitted, we expect the transgressor to make any atonement possible to\nhim, and he himself expects it.  But again, think if the destruction or\nserious injury of a man momentarily overcome by wrath or folly can be any\natonement to the commonwealth?  Surely it can only be an additional\ninjury to it.\"\n\nSaid I: \"But suppose the man has a habit of violence,--kills a man a\nyear, for instance?\"\n\n\"Such a thing is unknown,\" said he.  \"In a society where there is no\npunishment to evade, no law to triumph over, remorse will certainly\nfollow transgression.\"\n\n\"And lesser outbreaks of violence,\" said I, \"how do you deal with them?\nfor hitherto we have been talking of great tragedies, I suppose?\"\n\nSaid Hammond: \"If the ill-doer is not sick or mad (in which case he must\nbe restrained till his sickness or madness is cured) it is clear that\ngrief and humiliation must follow the ill-deed; and society in general\nwill make that pretty clear to the ill-doer if he should chance to be\ndull to it; and again, some kind of atonement will follow,--at the least,\nan open acknowledgement of the grief and humiliation.  Is it so hard to\nsay, I ask your pardon, neighbour?--Well, sometimes it is hard--and let\nit be.\"\n\n\"You think that enough?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"and moreover it is all that we _can_ do.  If in addition\nwe torture the man, we turn his grief into anger, and the humiliation he\nwould otherwise feel for _his_ wrong-doing is swallowed up by a hope of\nrevenge for _our_ wrong-doing to him.  He has paid the legal penalty, and\ncan 'go and sin again' with comfort.  Shall we commit such a folly, then?\nRemember Jesus had got the legal penalty remitted before he said 'Go and\nsin no more.'  Let alone that in a society of equals you will not find\nany one to play the part of torturer or jailer, though many to act as\nnurse or doctor.\"\n\n\"So,\" said I, \"you consider crime a mere spasmodic disease, which\nrequires no body of criminal law to deal with it?\"\n\n\"Pretty much so,\" said he; \"and since, as I have told you, we are a\nhealthy people generally, so we are not likely to be much troubled with\n_this_ disease.\"\n\n\"Well, you have no civil law, and no criminal law.  But have you no laws\nof the market, so to say--no regulation for the exchange of wares? for\nyou must exchange, even if you have no property.\"\n\nSaid he: \"We have no obvious individual exchange, as you saw this morning\nwhen you went a-shopping; but of course there are regulations of the\nmarkets, varying according to the circumstances and guided by general\ncustom.  But as these are matters of general assent, which nobody dreams\nof objecting to, so also we have made no provision for enforcing them:\ntherefore I don't call them laws.  In law, whether it be criminal or\ncivil, execution always follows judgment, and someone must suffer.  When\nyou see the judge on his bench, you see through him, as clearly as if he\nwere made of glass, the policeman to emprison, and the soldier to slay\nsome actual living person.  Such follies would make an agreeable market,\nwouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said I, \"that means turning the market into a mere battle-\nfield, in which many people must suffer as much as in the battle-field of\nbullet and bayonet.  And from what I have seen I should suppose that your\nmarketing, great and little, is carried on in a way that makes it a\npleasant occupation.\"\n\n\"You are right, neighbour,\" said he.  \"Although there are so many, indeed\nby far the greater number amongst us, who would be unhappy if they were\nnot engaged in actually making things, and things which turn out\nbeautiful under their hands,--there are many, like the housekeepers I was\nspeaking of, whose delight is in administration and organisation, to use\nlong-tailed words; I mean people who like keeping things together,\navoiding waste, seeing that nothing sticks fast uselessly.  Such people\nare thoroughly happy in their business, all the more as they are dealing\nwith actual facts, and not merely passing counters round to see what\nshare they shall have in the privileged taxation of useful people, which\nwas the business of the commercial folk in past days.  Well, what are you\ngoing to ask me next?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII: CONCERNING POLITICS\n\n\nSaid I: \"How do you manage with politics?\"\n\nSaid Hammond, smiling: \"I am glad that it is of _me_ that you ask that\nquestion; I do believe that anybody else would make you explain yourself,\nor try to do so, till you were sickened of asking questions.  Indeed, I\nbelieve I am the only man in England who would know what you mean; and\nsince I know, I will answer your question briefly by saying that we are\nvery well off as to politics,--because we have none.  If ever you make a\nbook out of this conversation, put this in a chapter by itself, after the\nmodel of old Horrebow's Snakes in Iceland.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV: HOW MATTERS ARE MANAGED\n\n\nSaid I: \"How about your relations with foreign nations?\"\n\n\"I will not affect not to know what you mean,\" said he, \"but I will tell\nyou at once that the whole system of rival and contending nations which\nplayed so great a part in the 'government' of the world of civilisation\nhas disappeared along with the inequality betwixt man and man in\nsociety.\"\n\n\"Does not that make the world duller?\" said I.\n\n\"Why?\" said the old man.\n\n\"The obliteration of national variety,\" said I.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" he said, somewhat snappishly.  \"Cross the water and see.  You\nwill find plenty of variety: the landscape, the building, the diet, the\namusements, all various.  The men and women varying in looks as well as\nin habits of thought; the costume far more various than in the commercial\nperiod.  How should it add to the variety or dispel the dulness, to\ncoerce certain families or tribes, often heterogeneous and jarring with\none another, into certain artificial and mechanical groups, and call them\nnations, and stimulate their patriotism--_i.e._, their foolish and\nenvious prejudices?\"\n\n\"Well--I don't know how,\" said I.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Hammond cheerily; \"you can easily understand that\nnow we are freed from this folly it is obvious to us that by means of\nthis very diversity the different strains of blood in the world can be\nserviceable and pleasant to each other, without in the least wanting to\nrob each other: we are all bent on the same enterprise, making the most\nof our lives.  And I must tell you whatever quarrels or misunderstandings\narise, they very seldom take place between people of different race; and\nconsequently since there is less unreason in them, they are the more\nreadily appeased.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said I, \"but as to those matters of politics; as to general\ndifferences of opinion in one and the same community.  Do you assert that\nthere are none?\"\n\n\"No, not at all,\" said he, somewhat snappishly; \"but I do say that\ndifferences of opinion about real solid things need not, and with us do\nnot, crystallise people into parties permanently hostile to one another,\nwith different theories as to the build of the universe and the progress\nof time.  Isn't that what politics used to mean?\"\n\n\"H'm, well,\" said I, \"I am not so sure of that.\"\n\nSaid he: \"I take, you, neighbour; they only _pretended_ to this serious\ndifference of opinion; for if it had existed they could not have dealt\ntogether in the ordinary business of life; couldn't have eaten together,\nbought and sold together, gambled together, cheated other people\ntogether, but must have fought whenever they met: which would not have\nsuited them at all.  The game of the masters of politics was to cajole or\nforce the public to pay the expense of a luxurious life and exciting\namusement for a few cliques of ambitious persons: and the _pretence_ of\nserious difference of opinion, belied by every action of their lives, was\nquite good enough for that.  What has all that got to do with us?\"\n\nSaid I: \"Why, nothing, I should hope.  But I fear--In short, I have been\ntold that political strife was a necessary result of human nature.\"\n\n\"Human nature!\" cried the old boy, impetuously; \"what human nature?  The\nhuman nature of paupers, of slaves, of slave-holders, or the human nature\nof wealthy freemen?  Which?  Come, tell me that!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I suppose there would be a difference according to\ncircumstances in people's action about these matters.\"\n\n\"I should think so, indeed,\" said he.  \"At all events, experience shows\nthat it is so.  Amongst us, our differences concern matters of business,\nand passing events as to them, and could not divide men permanently.  As\na rule, the immediate outcome shows which opinion on a given subject is\nthe right one; it is a matter of fact, not of speculation.  For instance,\nit is clearly not easy to knock up a political party on the question as\nto whether haymaking in such and such a country-side shall begin this\nweek or next, when all men agree that it must at latest begin the week\nafter next, and when any man can go down into the fields himself and see\nwhether the seeds are ripe enough for the cutting.\"\n\nSaid I: \"And you settle these differences, great and small, by the will\nof the majority, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said he; \"how else could we settle them?  You see in matters\nwhich are merely personal which do not affect the welfare of the\ncommunity--how a man shall dress, what he shall eat and drink, what he\nshall write and read, and so forth--there can be no difference of\nopinion, and everybody does as he pleases.  But when the matter is of\ncommon interest to the whole community, and the doing or not doing\nsomething affects everybody, the majority must have their way; unless the\nminority were to take up arms and show by force that they were the\neffective or real majority; which, however, in a society of men who are\nfree and equal is little likely to happen; because in such a community\nthe apparent majority _is_ the real majority, and the others, as I have\nhinted before, know that too well to obstruct from mere pigheadedness;\nespecially as they have had plenty of opportunity of putting forward\ntheir side of the question.\"\n\n\"How is that managed?\" said I.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"let us take one of our units of management, a commune,\nor a ward, or a parish (for we have all three names, indicating little\nreal distinction between them now, though time was there was a good\ndeal).  In such a district, as you would call it, some neighbours think\nthat something ought to be done or undone: a new town-hall built; a\nclearance of inconvenient houses; or say a stone bridge substituted for\nsome ugly old iron one,--there you have undoing and doing in one.  Well,\nat the next ordinary meeting of the neighbours, or Mote, as we call it,\naccording to the ancient tongue of the times before bureaucracy, a\nneighbour proposes the change, and of course, if everybody agrees, there\nis an end of discussion, except about details.  Equally, if no one backs\nthe proposer,--'seconds him,' it used to be called--the matter drops for\nthe time being; a thing not likely to happen amongst reasonable men,\nhowever, as the proposer is sure to have talked it over with others\nbefore the Mote.  But supposing the affair proposed and seconded, if a\nfew of the neighbours disagree to it, if they think that the beastly iron\nbridge will serve a little longer and they don't want to be bothered with\nbuilding a new one just then, they don't count heads that time, but put\noff the formal discussion to the next Mote; and meantime arguments _pro_\nand _con_ are flying about, and some get printed, so that everybody knows\nwhat is going on; and when the Mote comes together again there is a\nregular discussion and at last a vote by show of hands.  If the division\nis a close one, the question is again put off for further discussion; if\nthe division is a wide one, the minority are asked if they will yield to\nthe more general opinion, which they often, nay, most commonly do.  If\nthey refuse, the question is debated a third time, when, if the minority\nhas not perceptibly grown, they always give way; though I believe there\nis some half-forgotten rule by which they might still carry it on\nfurther; but I say, what always happens is that they are convinced, not\nperhaps that their view is the wrong one, but they cannot persuade or\nforce the community to adopt it.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said I; \"but what happens if the divisions are still\nnarrow?\"\n\nSaid he: \"As a matter of principle and according to the rule of such\ncases, the question must then lapse, and the majority, if so narrow, has\nto submit to sitting down under the _status quo_.  But I must tell you\nthat in point of fact the minority very seldom enforces this rule, but\ngenerally yields in a friendly manner.\"\n\n\"But do you know,\" said I, \"that there is something in all this very like\ndemocracy; and I thought that democracy was considered to be in a\nmoribund condition many, many years ago.\"\n\nThe old boy's eyes twinkled.  \"I grant you that our methods have that\ndrawback.  But what is to be done?  We can't get _anyone_ amongst us to\ncomplain of his not always having his own way in the teeth of the\ncommunity, when it is clear that _everybody_ cannot have that indulgence.\nWhat is to be done?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I don't know.\"\n\nSaid he: \"The only alternatives to our method that I can conceive of are\nthese.  First, that we should choose out, or breed, a class of superior\npersons capable of judging on all matters without consulting the\nneighbours; that, in short, we should get for ourselves what used to be\ncalled an aristocracy of intellect; or, secondly, that for the purpose of\nsafe-guarding the freedom of the individual will, we should revert to a\nsystem of private property again, and have slaves and slave-holders once\nmore.  What do you think of those two expedients?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"there is a third possibility--to wit, that every man\nshould be quite independent of every other, and that thus the tyranny of\nsociety should be abolished.\"\n\nHe looked hard at me for a second or two, and then burst out laughing\nvery heartily; and I confess that I joined him.  When he recovered\nhimself he nodded at me, and said: \"Yes, yes, I quite agree with you--and\nso we all do.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"and besides, it does not press hardly on the minority:\nfor, take this matter of the bridge, no man is obliged to work on it if\nhe doesn't agree to its building.  At least, I suppose not.\"\n\nHe smiled, and said: \"Shrewdly put; and yet from the point of view of the\nnative of another planet.  If the man of the minority does find his\nfeelings hurt, doubtless he may relieve them by refusing to help in\nbuilding the bridge.  But, dear neighbour, that is not a very effective\nsalve for the wound caused by the 'tyranny of a majority' in our society;\nbecause all work that is done is either beneficial or hurtful to every\nmember of society.  The man is benefited by the bridge-building if it\nturns out a good thing, and hurt by it if it turns out a bad one, whether\nhe puts a hand to it or not; and meanwhile he is benefiting the bridge-\nbuilders by his work, whatever that may be.  In fact, I see no help for\nhim except the pleasure of saying 'I told you so' if the bridge-building\nturns out to be a mistake and hurts him; if it benefits him he must\nsuffer in silence.  A terrible tyranny our Communism, is it not?  Folk\nused often to be warned against this very unhappiness in times past, when\nfor every well-fed, contented person you saw a thousand miserable\nstarvelings.  Whereas for us, we grow fat and well-liking on the tyranny;\na tyranny, to say the truth, not to be made visible by any microscope I\nknow.  Don't be afraid, my friend; we are not going to seek for troubles\nby calling our peace and plenty and happiness by ill names whose very\nmeaning we have forgotten!\"\n\nHe sat musing for a little, and then started and said: \"Are there any\nmore questions, dear guest?  The morning is waning fast amidst my\ngarrulity?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV: ON THE LACK OF INCENTIVE TO LABOUR IN A COMMUNIST SOCIETY\n\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.  \"I was expecting Dick and Clara to make their appearance\nany moment: but is there time to ask just one or two questions before\nthey come?\"\n\n\"Try it, dear neighbour--try it,\" said old Hammond.  \"For the more you\nask me the better I am pleased; and at any rate if they do come and find\nme in the middle of an answer, they must sit quiet and pretend to listen\ntill I come to an end.  It won't hurt them; they will find it quite\namusing enough to sit side by side, conscious of their proximity to each\nother.\"\n\nI smiled, as I was bound to, and said: \"Good; I will go on talking\nwithout noticing them when they come in.  Now, this is what I want to ask\nyou about--to wit, how you get people to work when there is no reward of\nlabour, and especially how you get them to work strenuously?\"\n\n\"No reward of labour?\" said Hammond, gravely.  \"The reward of labour is\n_life_.  Is that not enough?\"\n\n\"But no reward for especially good work,\" quoth I.\n\n\"Plenty of reward,\" said he--\"the reward of creation.  The wages which\nGod gets, as people might have said time agone.  If you are going to ask\nto be paid for the pleasure of creation, which is what excellence in work\nmeans, the next thing we shall hear of will be a bill sent in for the\nbegetting of children.\"\n\n\"Well, but,\" said I, \"the man of the nineteenth century would say there\nis a natural desire towards the procreation of children, and a natural\ndesire not to work.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said he, \"I know the ancient platitude,--wholly untrue;\nindeed, to us quite meaningless.  Fourier, whom all men laughed at,\nunderstood the matter better.\"\n\n\"Why is it meaningless to you?\" said I.\n\nHe said: \"Because it implies that all work is suffering, and we are so\nfar from thinking that, that, as you may have noticed, whereas we are not\nshort of wealth, there is a kind of fear growing up amongst us that we\nshall one day be short of work.  It is a pleasure which we are afraid of\nlosing, not a pain.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I have noticed that, and I was going to ask you about\nthat also.  But in the meantime, what do you positively mean to assert\nabout the pleasurableness of work amongst you?\"\n\n\"This, that _all_ work is now pleasurable; either because of the hope of\ngain in honour and wealth with which the work is done, which causes\npleasurable excitement, even when the actual work is not pleasant; or\nelse because it has grown into a pleasurable _habit_, as in the case with\nwhat you may call mechanical work; and lastly (and most of our work is of\nthis kind) because there is conscious sensuous pleasure in the work\nitself; it is done, that is, by artists.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said I.  \"Can you now tell me how you have come to this happy\ncondition?  For, to speak plainly, this change from the conditions of the\nolder world seems to me far greater and more important than all the other\nchanges you have told me about as to crime, politics, property,\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"You are right there,\" said he.  \"Indeed, you may say rather that it is\nthis change which makes all the others possible.  What is the object of\nRevolution?  Surely to make people happy.  Revolution having brought its\nforedoomed change about, how can you prevent the counter-revolution from\nsetting in except by making people happy?  What! shall we expect peace\nand stability from unhappiness?  The gathering of grapes from thorns and\nfigs from thistles is a reasonable expectation compared with that!  And\nhappiness without happy daily work is impossible.\"\n\n\"Most obviously true,\" said I: for I thought the old boy was preaching a\nlittle.  \"But answer my question, as to how you gained this happiness.\"\n\n\"Briefly,\" said he, \"by the absence of artificial coercion, and the\nfreedom for every man to do what he can do best, joined to the knowledge\nof what productions of labour we really wanted.  I must admit that this\nknowledge we reached slowly and painfully.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said I, \"give me more detail; explain more fully.  For this\nsubject interests me intensely.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" said he; \"but in order to do so I must weary you by\ntalking a little about the past.  Contrast is necessary for this\nexplanation.  Do you mind?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said I.\n\nSaid he, settling himself in his chair again for a long talk: \"It is\nclear from all that we hear and read, that in the last age of\ncivilisation men had got into a vicious circle in the matter of\nproduction of wares.  They had reached a wonderful facility of\nproduction, and in order to make the most of that facility they had\ngradually created (or allowed to grow, rather) a most elaborate system of\nbuying and selling, which has been called the World-Market; and that\nWorld-Market, once set a-going, forced them to go on making more and more\nof these wares, whether they needed them or not.  So that while (of\ncourse) they could not free themselves from the toil of making real\nnecessaries, they created in a never-ending series sham or artificial\nnecessaries, which became, under the iron rule of the aforesaid World-\nMarket, of equal importance to them with the real necessaries which\nsupported life.  By all this they burdened themselves with a prodigious\nmass of work merely for the sake of keeping their wretched system going.\"\n\n\"Yes--and then?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, then, since they had forced themselves to stagger along under this\nhorrible burden of unnecessary production, it became impossible for them\nto look upon labour and its results from any other point of view than\none--to wit, the ceaseless endeavour to expend the least possible amount\nof labour on any article made, and yet at the same time to make as many\narticles as possible.  To this 'cheapening of production', as it was\ncalled, everything was sacrificed: the happiness of the workman at his\nwork, nay, his most elementary comfort and bare health, his food, his\nclothes, his dwelling, his leisure, his amusement, his education--his\nlife, in short--did not weigh a grain of sand in the balance against this\ndire necessity of 'cheap production' of things, a great part of which\nwere not worth producing at all.  Nay, we are told, and we must believe\nit, so overwhelming is the evidence, though many of our people scarcely\n_can_ believe it, that even rich and powerful men, the masters of the\npoor devils aforesaid, submitted to live amidst sights and sounds and\nsmells which it is in the very nature of man to abhor and flee from, in\norder that their riches might bolster up this supreme folly.  The whole\ncommunity, in fact, was cast into the jaws of this ravening monster, 'the\ncheap production' forced upon it by the World-Market.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said I.  \"But what happened?  Did not their cleverness and\nfacility in production master this chaos of misery at last?  Couldn't\nthey catch up with the World-Market, and then set to work to devise means\nfor relieving themselves from this fearful task of extra labour?\"\n\nHe smiled bitterly.  \"Did they even try to?\" said he.  \"I am not sure.\nYou know that according to the old saw the beetle gets used to living in\ndung; and these people, whether they found the dung sweet or not,\ncertainly lived in it.\"\n\nHis estimate of the life of the nineteenth century made me catch my\nbreath a little; and I said feebly, \"But the labour-saving machines?\"\n\n\"Heyday!\" quoth he.  \"What's that you are saying? the labour-saving\nmachines?  Yes, they were made to 'save labour' (or, to speak more\nplainly, the lives of men) on one piece of work in order that it might be\nexpended--I will say wasted--on another, probably useless, piece of work.\nFriend, all their devices for cheapening labour simply resulted in\nincreasing the burden of labour.  The appetite of the World-Market grew\nwith what it fed on: the countries within the ring of 'civilisation'\n(that is, organised misery) were glutted with the abortions of the\nmarket, and force and fraud were used unsparingly to 'open up' countries\n_outside_ that pale.  This process of 'opening up' is a strange one to\nthose who have read the professions of the men of that period and do not\nunderstand their practice; and perhaps shows us at its worst the great\nvice of the nineteenth century, the use of hypocrisy and cant to evade\nthe responsibility of vicarious ferocity.  When the civilised\nWorld-Market coveted a country not yet in its clutches, some transparent\npretext was found--the suppression of a slavery different from and not so\ncruel as that of commerce; the pushing of a religion no longer believed\nin by its promoters; the 'rescue' of some desperado or homicidal madman\nwhose misdeeds had got him into trouble amongst the natives of the\n'barbarous' country--any stick, in short, which would beat the dog at\nall.  Then some bold, unprincipled, ignorant adventurer was found (no\ndifficult task in the days of competition), and he was bribed to 'create\na market' by breaking up whatever traditional society there might be in\nthe doomed country, and by destroying whatever leisure or pleasure he\nfound there.  He forced wares on the natives which they did not want, and\ntook their natural products in 'exchange,' as this form of robbery was\ncalled, and thereby he 'created new wants,' to supply which (that is, to\nbe allowed to live by their new masters) the hapless, helpless people had\nto sell themselves into the slavery of hopeless toil so that they might\nhave something wherewith to purchase the nullities of 'civilisation.'\n\n\"Ah,\" said the old man, pointing to the Museum, \"I have read books and\npapers in there, telling strange stories indeed of the dealings of\ncivilisation (or organised misery) with 'non-civilisation'; from the time\nwhen the British Government deliberately sent blankets infected with\nsmall-pox as choice gifts to inconvenient tribes of Red-skins, to the\ntime when Africa was infested by a man named Stanley, who--\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said I, \"but as you know, time presses; and I want to keep\nour question on the straightest line possible; and I want at once to ask\nthis about these wares made for the World-Market--how about their\nquality; these people who were so clever about making goods, I suppose\nthey made them well?\"\n\n\"Quality!\" said the old man crustily, for he was rather peevish at being\ncut short in his story; \"how could they possibly attend to such trifles\nas the quality of the wares they sold?  The best of them were of a lowish\naverage, the worst were transparent make-shifts for the things asked for,\nwhich nobody would have put up with if they could have got anything else.\nIt was a current jest of the time that the wares were made to sell and\nnot to use; a jest which you, as coming from another planet, may\nunderstand, but which our folk could not.\"\n\nSaid I: \"What! did they make nothing well?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said he, \"there was one class of goods which they did make\nthoroughly well, and that was the class of machines which were used for\nmaking things.  These were usually quite perfect pieces of workmanship,\nadmirably adapted to the end in view.  So that it may be fairly said that\nthe great achievement of the nineteenth century was the making of\nmachines which were wonders of invention, skill, and patience, and which\nwere used for the production of measureless quantities of worthless make-\nshifts.  In truth, the owners of the machines did not consider anything\nwhich they made as wares, but simply as means for the enrichment of\nthemselves.  Of course the only admitted test of utility in wares was the\nfinding of buyers for them--wise men or fools, as it might chance.\"\n\n\"And people put up with this?\" said I.\n\n\"For a time,\" said he.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then the overturn,\" said the old man, smiling, \"and the nineteenth\ncentury saw itself as a man who has lost his clothes whilst bathing, and\nhas to walk naked through the town.\"\n\n\"You are very bitter about that unlucky nineteenth century,\" said I.\n\n\"Naturally,\" said he, \"since I know so much about it.\"\n\nHe was silent a little, and then said: \"There are traditions--nay, real\nhistories--in our family about it: my grandfather was one of its victims.\nIf you know something about it, you will understand what he suffered when\nI tell you that he was in those days a genuine artist, a man of genius,\nand a revolutionist.\"\n\n\"I think I do understand,\" said I: \"but now, as it seems, you have\nreversed all this?\"\n\n\"Pretty much so,\" said he.  \"The wares which we make are made because\nthey are needed: men make for their neighbours' use as if they were\nmaking for themselves, not for a vague market of which they know nothing,\nand over which they have no control: as there is no buying and selling,\nit would be mere insanity to make goods on the chance of their being\nwanted; for there is no longer anyone who can be compelled to buy them.\nSo that whatever is made is good, and thoroughly fit for its purpose.\nNothing can be made except for genuine use; therefore no inferior goods\nare made.  Moreover, as aforesaid, we have now found out what we want, so\nwe make no more than we want; and as we are not driven to make a vast\nquantity of useless things we have time and resources enough to consider\nour pleasure in making them.  All work which would be irksome to do by\nhand is done by immensely improved machinery; and in all work which it is\na pleasure to do by hand machinery is done without.  There is no\ndifficulty in finding work which suits the special turn of mind of\neverybody; so that no man is sacrificed to the wants of another.  From\ntime to time, when we have found out that some piece of work was too\ndisagreeable or troublesome, we have given it up and done altogether\nwithout the thing produced by it.  Now, surely you can see that under\nthese circumstances all the work that we do is an exercise of the mind\nand body more or less pleasant to be done: so that instead of avoiding\nwork everybody seeks it: and, since people have got defter in doing the\nwork generation after generation, it has become so easy to do, that it\nseems as if there were less done, though probably more is produced.  I\nsuppose this explains that fear, which I hinted at just now, of a\npossible scarcity in work, which perhaps you have already noticed, and\nwhich is a feeling on the increase, and has been for a score of years.\"\n\n\"But do you think,\" said I, \"that there is any fear of a work-famine\namongst you?\"\n\n\"No, I do not,\" said he, \"and I will tell why; it is each man's business\nto make his own work pleasanter and pleasanter, which of course tends\ntowards raising the standard of excellence, as no man enjoys turning out\nwork which is not a credit to him, and also to greater deliberation in\nturning it out; and there is such a vast number of things which can be\ntreated as works of art, that this alone gives employment to a host of\ndeft people.  Again, if art be inexhaustible, so is science also; and\nthough it is no longer the only innocent occupation which is thought\nworth an intelligent man spending his time upon, as it once was, yet\nthere are, and I suppose will be, many people who are excited by its\nconquest of difficulties, and care for it more than for anything else.\nAgain, as more and more of pleasure is imported into work, I think we\nshall take up kinds of work which produce desirable wares, but which we\ngave up because we could not carry them on pleasantly.  Moreover, I think\nthat it is only in parts of Europe which are more advanced than the rest\nof the world that you will hear this talk of the fear of a work-famine.\nThose lands which were once the colonies of Great Britain, for instance,\nand especially America--that part of it, above all, which was once the\nUnited states--are now and will be for a long while a great resource to\nus.  For these lands, and, I say, especially the northern parts of\nAmerica, suffered so terribly from the full force of the last days of\ncivilisation, and became such horrible places to live in, that they are\nnow very backward in all that makes life pleasant.  Indeed, one may say\nthat for nearly a hundred years the people of the northern parts of\nAmerica have been engaged in gradually making a dwelling-place out of a\nstinking dust-heap; and there is still a great deal to do, especially as\nthe country is so big.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I am exceedingly glad to think that you have such a\nprospect of happiness before you.  But I should like to ask a few more\nquestions, and then I have done for to-day.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI: DINNER IN THE HALL OF THE BLOOMSBURY MARKET\n\n\nAs I spoke, I heard footsteps near the door; the latch yielded, and in\ncame our two lovers, looking so handsome that one had no feeling of shame\nin looking on at their little-concealed love-making; for indeed it seemed\nas if all the world must be in love with them.  As for old Hammond, he\nlooked on them like an artist who has just painted a picture nearly as\nwell as he thought he could when he began it, and was perfectly happy.  He\nsaid:\n\n\"Sit down, sit down, young folk, and don't make a noise.  Our guest here\nhas still some questions to ask me.\"\n\n\"Well, I should suppose so,\" said Dick; \"you have only been three hours\nand a half together; and it isn't to be hoped that the history of two\ncenturies could be told in three hours and a half: let alone that, for\nall I know, you may have been wandering into the realms of geography and\ncraftsmanship.\"\n\n\"As to noise, my dear kinsman,\" said Clara, \"you will very soon be\ndisturbed by the noise of the dinner-bell, which I should think will be\nvery pleasant music to our guest, who breakfasted early, it seems, and\nprobably had a tiring day yesterday.\"\n\nI said: \"Well, since you have spoken the word, I begin to feel that it is\nso; but I have been feeding myself with wonder this long time past:\nreally, it's quite true,\" quoth I, as I saw her smile, O so prettily!  But\njust then from some tower high up in the air came the sound of silvery\nchimes playing a sweet clear tune, that sounded to my unaccustomed ears\nlike the song of the first blackbird in the spring, and called a rush of\nmemories to my mind, some of bad times, some of good, but all sweetened\nnow into mere pleasure.\n\n\"No more questions now before dinner,\" said Clara; and she took my hand\nas an affectionate child would, and led me out of the room and down\nstairs into the forecourt of the Museum, leaving the two Hammonds to\nfollow as they pleased.\n\nWe went into the market-place which I had been in before, a thinnish\nstream of elegantly {1} dressed people going in along with us.  We turned\ninto the cloister and came to a richly moulded and carved doorway, where\na very pretty dark-haired young girl gave us each a beautiful bunch of\nsummer flowers, and we entered a hall much bigger than that of the\nHammersmith Guest House, more elaborate in its architecture and perhaps\nmore beautiful.  I found it difficult to keep my eyes off the\nwall-pictures (for I thought it bad manners to stare at Clara all the\ntime, though she was quite worth it).  I saw at a glance that their\nsubjects were taken from queer old-world myths and imaginations which in\nyesterday's world only about half a dozen people in the country knew\nanything about; and when the two Hammonds sat down opposite to us, I said\nto the old man, pointing to the frieze:\n\n\"How strange to see such subjects here!\"\n\n\"Why?\" said he.  \"I don't see why you should be surprised; everybody\nknows the tales; and they are graceful and pleasant subjects, not too\ntragic for a place where people mostly eat and drink and amuse\nthemselves, and yet full of incident.\"\n\nI smiled, and said: \"Well, I scarcely expected to find record of the\nSeven Swans and the King of the Golden Mountain and Faithful Henry, and\nsuch curious pleasant imaginations as Jacob Grimm got together from the\nchildhood of the world, barely lingering even in his time: I should have\nthought you would have forgotten such childishness by this time.\"\n\nThe old man smiled, and said nothing; but Dick turned rather red, and\nbroke out:\n\n\"What _do_ you mean, guest?  I think them very beautiful, I mean not only\nthe pictures, but the stories; and when we were children we used to\nimagine them going on in every wood-end, by the bight of every stream:\nevery house in the fields was the Fairyland King's House to us.  Don't\nyou remember, Clara?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said; and it seemed to me as if a slight cloud came over her\nfair face.  I was going to speak to her on the subject, when the pretty\nwaitresses came to us smiling, and chattering sweetly like reed warblers\nby the river side, and fell to giving us our dinner.  As to this, as at\nour breakfast, everything was cooked and served with a daintiness which\nshowed that those who had prepared it were interested in it; but there\nwas no excess either of quantity or of gourmandise; everything was\nsimple, though so excellent of its kind; and it was made clear to us that\nthis was no feast, only an ordinary meal.  The glass, crockery, and plate\nwere very beautiful to my eyes, used to the study of mediaeval art; but a\nnineteenth-century club-haunter would, I daresay, have found them rough\nand lacking in finish; the crockery being lead-glazed pot-ware, though\nbeautifully ornamented; the only porcelain being here and there a piece\nof old oriental ware.  The glass, again, though elegant and quaint, and\nvery varied in form, was somewhat bubbled and hornier in texture than the\ncommercial articles of the nineteenth century.  The furniture and general\nfittings of the hall were much of a piece with the table-gear, beautiful\nin form and highly ornamented, but without the commercial \"finish\" of the\njoiners and cabinet-makers of our time.  Withal, there was a total\nabsence of what the nineteenth century calls \"comfort\"--that is, stuffy\ninconvenience; so that, even apart from the delightful excitement of the\nday, I had never eaten my dinner so pleasantly before.\n\nWhen we had done eating, and were sitting a little while, with a bottle\nof very good Bordeaux wine before us, Clara came back to the question of\nthe subject-matter of the pictures, as though it had troubled her.\n\nShe looked up at them, and said: \"How is it that though we are so\ninterested with our life for the most part, yet when people take to\nwriting poems or painting pictures they seldom deal with our modern life,\nor if they do, take good care to make their poems or pictures unlike that\nlife?  Are we not good enough to paint ourselves?  How is it that we find\nthe dreadful times of the past so interesting to us--in pictures and\npoetry?\"\n\nOld Hammond smiled.  \"It always was so, and I suppose always will be,\"\nsaid he, \"however it may be explained.  It is true that in the nineteenth\ncentury, when there was so little art and so much talk about it, there\nwas a theory that art and imaginative literature ought to deal with\ncontemporary life; but they never did so; for, if there was any pretence\nof it, the author always took care (as Clara hinted just now) to\ndisguise, or exaggerate, or idealise, and in some way or another make it\nstrange; so that, for all the verisimilitude there was, he might just as\nwell have dealt with the times of the Pharaohs.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dick, \"surely it is but natural to like these things\nstrange; just as when we were children, as I said just now, we used to\npretend to be so-and-so in such-and-such a place.  That's what these\npictures and poems do; and why shouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Thou hast hit it, Dick,\" quoth old Hammond; \"it is the child-like part\nof us that produces works of imagination.  When we are children time\npasses so slow with us that we seem to have time for everything.\"\n\nHe sighed, and then smiled and said: \"At least let us rejoice that we\nhave got back our childhood again.  I drink to the days that are!\"\n\n\"Second childhood,\" said I in a low voice, and then blushed at my double\nrudeness, and hoped that he hadn't heard.  But he had, and turned to me\nsmiling, and said: \"Yes, why not?  And for my part, I hope it may last\nlong; and that the world's next period of wise and unhappy manhood, if\nthat should happen, will speedily lead us to a third childhood: if indeed\nthis age be not our third.  Meantime, my friend, you must know that we\nare too happy, both individually and collectively, to trouble ourselves\nabout what is to come hereafter.\"\n\n\"Well, for my part,\" said Clara, \"I wish we were interesting enough to be\nwritten or painted about.\"\n\nDick answered her with some lover's speech, impossible to be written\ndown, and then we sat quiet a little.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII: HOW THE CHANGE CAME\n\n\nDick broke the silence at last, saying: \"Guest, forgive us for a little\nafter-dinner dulness.  What would you like to do?  Shall we have out\nGreylocks and trot back to Hammersmith? or will you come with us and hear\nsome Welsh folk sing in a hall close by here? or would you like presently\nto come with me into the City and see some really fine building? or--what\nshall it be?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"as I am a stranger, I must let you choose for me.\"\n\nIn point of fact, I did not by any means want to be 'amused' just then;\nand also I rather felt as if the old man, with his knowledge of past\ntimes, and even a kind of inverted sympathy for them caused by his active\nhatred of them, was as it were a blanket for me against the cold of this\nvery new world, where I was, so to say, stripped bare of every habitual\nthought and way of acting; and I did not want to leave him too soon.  He\ncame to my rescue at once, and said--\n\n\"Wait a bit, Dick; there is someone else to be consulted besides you and\nthe guest here, and that is I.  I am not going to lose the pleasure of\nhis company just now, especially as I know he has something else to ask\nme.  So go to your Welshmen, by all means; but first of all bring us\nanother bottle of wine to this nook, and then be off as soon as you like;\nand come again and fetch our friend to go westward, but not too soon.\"\n\nDick nodded smilingly, and the old man and I were soon alone in the great\nhall, the afternoon sun gleaming on the red wine in our tall\nquaint-shaped glasses.  Then said Hammond:\n\n\"Does anything especially puzzle you about our way of living, now you\nhave heard a good deal and seen a little of it?\"\n\nSaid I: \"I think what puzzles me most is how it all came about.\"\n\n\"It well may,\" said he, \"so great as the change is.  It would be\ndifficult indeed to tell you the whole story, perhaps impossible:\nknowledge, discontent, treachery, disappointment, ruin, misery,\ndespair--those who worked for the change because they could see further\nthan other people went through all these phases of suffering; and\ndoubtless all the time the most of men looked on, not knowing what was\ndoing, thinking it all a matter of course, like the rising and setting of\nthe sun--and indeed it was so.\"\n\n\"Tell me one thing, if you can,\" said I.  \"Did the change, the\n'revolution' it used to be called, come peacefully?\"\n\n\"Peacefully?\" said he; \"what peace was there amongst those poor confused\nwretches of the nineteenth century?  It was war from beginning to end:\nbitter war, till hope and pleasure put an end to it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean actual fighting with weapons?\" said I, \"or the strikes and\nlock-outs and starvation of which we have heard?\"\n\n\"Both, both,\" he said.  \"As a matter of fact, the history of the terrible\nperiod of transition from commercial slavery to freedom may thus be\nsummarised.  When the hope of realising a communal condition of life for\nall men arose, quite late in the nineteenth century, the power of the\nmiddle classes, the then tyrants of society, was so enormous and\ncrushing, that to almost all men, even those who had, you may say despite\nthemselves, despite their reason and judgment, conceived such hopes, it\nseemed a dream.  So much was this the case that some of those more\nenlightened men who were then called Socialists, although they well knew,\nand even stated in public, that the only reasonable condition of Society\nwas that of pure Communism (such as you now see around you), yet shrunk\nfrom what seemed to them the barren task of preaching the realisation of\na happy dream.  Looking back now, we can see that the great motive-power\nof the change was a longing for freedom and equality, akin if you please\nto the unreasonable passion of the lover; a sickness of heart that\nrejected with loathing the aimless solitary life of the well-to-do\neducated man of that time: phrases, my dear friend, which have lost their\nmeaning to us of the present day; so far removed we are from the dreadful\nfacts which they represent.\n\n\"Well, these men, though conscious of this feeling, had no faith in it,\nas a means of bringing about the change.  Nor was that wonderful: for\nlooking around them they saw the huge mass of the oppressed classes too\nmuch burdened with the misery of their lives, and too much overwhelmed by\nthe selfishness of misery, to be able to form a conception of any escape\nfrom it except by the ordinary way prescribed by the system of slavery\nunder which they lived; which was nothing more than a remote chance of\nclimbing out of the oppressed into the oppressing class.\n\n\"Therefore, though they knew that the only reasonable aim for those who\nwould better the world was a condition of equality; in their impatience\nand despair they managed to convince themselves that if they could by\nhook or by crook get the machinery of production and the management of\nproperty so altered that the 'lower classes' (so the horrible word ran)\nmight have their slavery somewhat ameliorated, they would be ready to fit\ninto this machinery, and would use it for bettering their condition still\nmore and still more, until at last the result would be a practical\nequality (they were very fond of using the word 'practical'), because\n'the rich' would be forced to pay so much for keeping 'the poor' in a\ntolerable condition that the condition of riches would become no longer\nvaluable and would gradually die out.  Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"Partly,\" said I.  \"Go on.\"\n\nSaid old Hammond: \"Well, since you follow me, you will see that as a\ntheory this was not altogether unreasonable; but 'practically,' it turned\nout a failure.\"\n\n\"How so?\" said I.\n\n\"Well, don't you see,\" said he, \"because it involved the making of a\nmachinery by those who didn't know what they wanted the machines to do.\nSo far as the masses of the oppressed class furthered this scheme of\nimprovement, they did it to get themselves improved slave-rations--as\nmany of them as could.  And if those classes had really been incapable of\nbeing touched by that instinct which produced the passion for freedom and\nequality aforesaid, what would have happened, I think, would have been\nthis: that a certain part of the working classes would have been so far\nimproved in condition that they would have approached the condition of\nthe middling rich men; but below them would have been a great class of\nmost miserable slaves, whose slavery would have been far more hopeless\nthan the older class-slavery had been.\"\n\n\"What stood in the way of this?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, of course,\" said he, \"just that instinct for freedom aforesaid.  It\nis true that the slave-class could not conceive the happiness of a free\nlife.  Yet they grew to understand (and very speedily too) that they were\noppressed by their masters, and they assumed, you see how justly, that\nthey could do without them, though perhaps they scarce knew how; so that\nit came to this, that though they could not look forward to the happiness\nor peace of the freeman, they did at least look forward to the war which\na vague hope told them would bring that peace about.\"\n\n\"Could you tell me rather more closely what actually took place?\" said I;\nfor I thought _him_ rather vague here.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I can.  That machinery of life for the use of people who\ndidn't know what they wanted of it, and which was known at the time as\nState Socialism, was partly put in motion, though in a very piecemeal\nway.  But it did not work smoothly; it was, of course, resisted at every\nturn by the capitalists; and no wonder, for it tended more and more to\nupset the commercial system I have told you of; without providing\nanything really effective in its place.  The result was growing\nconfusion, great suffering amongst the working classes, and, as a\nconsequence, great discontent.  For a long time matters went on like\nthis.  The power of the upper classes had lessened, as their command over\nwealth lessened, and they could not carry things wholly by the high hand\nas they had been used to in earlier days.  So far the State Socialists\nwere justified by the result.  On the other hand, the working classes\nwere ill-organised, and growing poorer in reality, in spite of the gains\n(also real in the long run) which they had forced from the masters.  Thus\nmatters hung in the balance; the masters could not reduce their slaves to\ncomplete subjection, though they put down some feeble and partial riots\neasily enough.  The workers forced their masters to grant them\nameliorations, real or imaginary, of their condition, but could not force\nfreedom from them.  At last came a great crash.  To explain this you must\nunderstand that very great progress had been made amongst the workers,\nthough as before said but little in the direction of improved\nlivelihood.\"\n\nI played the innocent and said: \"In what direction could they improve, if\nnot in livelihood?\"\n\nSaid he: \"In the power to bring about a state of things in which\nlivelihood would be full, and easy to gain.  They had at last learned how\nto combine after a long period of mistakes and disasters.  The workmen\nhad now a regular organization in the struggle against their masters, a\nstruggle which for more than half a century had been accepted as an\ninevitable part of the conditions of the modern system of labour and\nproduction.  This combination had now taken the form of a federation of\nall or almost all the recognised wage-paid employments, and it was by its\nmeans that those betterments of the conditions of the workmen had been\nforced from the masters: and though they were not seldom mixed up with\nthe rioting that happened, especially in the earlier days of their\norganization, it by no means formed an essential part of their tactics;\nindeed at the time I am now speaking of they had got to be so strong that\nmost commonly the mere threat of a 'strike' was enough to gain any minor\npoint: because they had given up the foolish tactics of the ancient\ntrades unions of calling out of work a part only of the workers of such\nand such an industry, and supporting them while out of work on the labour\nof those that remained in.  By this time they had a biggish fund of money\nfor the support of strikes, and could stop a certain industry altogether\nfor a time if they so determined.\"\n\nSaid I: \"Was there not a serious danger of such moneys being misused--of\njobbery, in fact?\"\n\nOld Hammond wriggled uneasily on his seat, and said:\n\n\"Though all this happened so long ago, I still feel the pain of mere\nshame when I have to tell you that it was more than a danger: that such\nrascality often happened; indeed more than once the whole combination\nseemed dropping to pieces because of it: but at the time of which I am\ntelling, things looked so threatening, and to the workmen at least the\nnecessity of their dealing with the fast-gathering trouble which the\nlabour-struggle had brought about, was so clear, that the conditions of\nthe times had begot a deep seriousness amongst all reasonable people; a\ndetermination which put aside all non-essentials, and which to thinking\nmen was ominous of the swiftly-approaching change: such an element was\ntoo dangerous for mere traitors and self-seekers, and one by one they\nwere thrust out and mostly joined the declared reactionaries.\"\n\n\"How about those ameliorations,\" said I; \"what were they? or rather of\nwhat nature?\"\n\nSaid he: \"Some of them, and these of the most practical importance to the\nmens' livelihood, were yielded by the masters by direct compulsion on the\npart of the men; the new conditions of labour so gained were indeed only\ncustomary, enforced by no law: but, once established, the masters durst\nnot attempt to withdraw them in face of the growing power of the combined\nworkers.  Some again were steps on the path of 'State Socialism'; the\nmost important of which can be speedily summed up.  At the end of the\nnineteenth century the cry arose for compelling the masters to employ\ntheir men a less number of hours in the day: this cry gathered volume\nquickly, and the masters had to yield to it.  But it was, of course,\nclear that unless this meant a higher price for work per hour, it would\nbe a mere nullity, and that the masters, unless forced, would reduce it\nto that.  Therefore after a long struggle another law was passed fixing a\nminimum price for labour in the most important industries; which again\nhad to be supplemented by a law fixing the maximum price on the chief\nwares then considered necessary for a workman's life.\"\n\n\"You were getting perilously near to the late Roman poor-rates,\" said I,\nsmiling, \"and the doling out of bread to the proletariat.\"\n\n\"So many said at the time,\" said the old man drily; \"and it has long been\na commonplace that that slough awaits State Socialism in the end, if it\ngets to the end, which as you know it did not with us.  However it went\nfurther than this minimum and maximum business, which by the by we can\nnow see was necessary.  The government now found it imperative on them to\nmeet the outcry of the master class at the approaching destruction of\nCommerce (as desirable, had they known it, as the extinction of the\ncholera, which has since happily taken place).  And they were forced to\nmeet it by a measure hostile to the masters, the establishment of\ngovernment factories for the production of necessary wares, and markets\nfor their sale.  These measures taken altogether did do something: they\nwere in fact of the nature of regulations made by the commander of a\nbeleaguered city.  But of course to the privileged classes it seemed as\nif the end of the world were come when such laws were enacted.\n\n\"Nor was that altogether without a warrant: the spread of communistic\ntheories, and the partial practice of State Socialism had at first\ndisturbed, and at last almost paralysed the marvellous system of commerce\nunder which the old world had lived so feverishly, and had produced for\nsome few a life of gambler's pleasure, and for many, or most, a life of\nmere misery: over and over again came 'bad times' as they were called,\nand indeed they were bad enough for the wage-slaves.  The year 1952 was\none of the worst of these times; the workmen suffered dreadfully: the\npartial, inefficient government factories, which were terribly jobbed,\nall but broke down, and a vast part of the population had for the time\nbeing to be fed on undisguised \"charity\" as it was called.\n\n\"The Combined Workers watched the situation with mingled hope and\nanxiety.  They had already formulated their general demands; but now by a\nsolemn and universal vote of the whole of their federated societies, they\ninsisted on the first step being taken toward carrying out their demands:\nthis step would have led directly to handing over the management of the\nwhole natural resources of the country, together with the machinery for\nusing them into the power of the Combined Workers, and the reduction of\nthe privileged classes into the position of pensioners obviously\ndependent on the pleasure of the workers.  The 'Resolution,' as it was\ncalled, which was widely published in the newspapers of the day, was in\nfact a declaration of war, and was so accepted by the master class.  They\nbegan henceforward to prepare for a firm stand against the 'brutal and\nferocious communism of the day,' as they phrased it.  And as they were in\nmany ways still very powerful, or seemed so to be; they still hoped by\nmeans of brute force to regain some of what they had lost, and perhaps in\nthe end the whole of it.  It was said amongst them on all hands that it\nhad been a great mistake of the various governments not to have resisted\nsooner; and the liberals and radicals (the name as perhaps you may know\nof the more democratically inclined part of the ruling classes) were much\nblamed for having led the world to this pass by their mis-timed pedantry\nand foolish sentimentality: and one Gladstone, or Gledstein (probably,\njudging by this name, of Scandinavian descent), a notable politician of\nthe nineteenth century, was especially singled out for reprobation in\nthis respect.  I need scarcely point out to you the absurdity of all\nthis.  But terrible tragedy lay hidden behind this grinning through a\nhorse-collar of the reactionary party.  'The insatiable greed of the\nlower classes must be repressed'--'The people must be taught a\nlesson'--these were the sacramental phrases current amongst the\nreactionists, and ominous enough they were.\"\n\nThe old man stopped to look keenly at my attentive and wondering face;\nand then said:\n\n\"I know, dear guest, that I have been using words and phrases which few\npeople amongst us could understand without long and laborious\nexplanation; and not even then perhaps.  But since you have not yet gone\nto sleep, and since I am speaking to you as to a being from another\nplanet, I may venture to ask you if you have followed me thus far?\"\n\n\"O yes,\" said I, \"I quite understand: pray go on; a great deal of what\nyou have been saying was common place with us--when--when--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he gravely, \"when you were dwelling in the other planet.\nWell, now for the crash aforesaid.\n\n\"On some comparatively trifling occasion a great meeting was summoned by\nthe workmen leaders to meet in Trafalgar Square (about the right to meet\nin which place there had for years and years been bickering).  The civic\nbourgeois guard (called the police) attacked the said meeting with\nbludgeons, according to their custom; many people were hurt in the\n_melee_, of whom five in all died, either trampled to death on the spot,\nor from the effects of their cudgelling; the meeting was scattered, and\nsome hundred of prisoners cast into gaol.  A similar meeting had been\ntreated in the same way a few days before at a place called Manchester,\nwhich has now disappeared.  Thus the 'lesson' began.  The whole country\nwas thrown into a ferment by this; meetings were held which attempted\nsome rough organisation for the holding of another meeting to retort on\nthe authorities.  A huge crowd assembled in Trafalgar Square and the\nneighbourhood (then a place of crowded streets), and was too big for the\nbludgeon-armed police to cope with; there was a good deal of dry-blow\nfighting; three or four of the people were killed, and half a score of\npolicemen were crushed to death in the throng, and the rest got away as\nthey could.  This was a victory for the people as far as it went.  The\nnext day all London (remember what it was in those days) was in a state\nof turmoil.  Many of the rich fled into the country; the executive got\ntogether soldiery, but did not dare to use them; and the police could not\nbe massed in any one place, because riots or threats of riots were\neverywhere.  But in Manchester, where the people were not so courageous\nor not so desperate as in London, several of the popular leaders were\narrested.  In London a convention of leaders was got together from the\nFederation of Combined Workmen, and sat under the old revolutionary name\nof the Committee of Public Safety; but as they had no drilled and armed\nbody of men to direct, they attempted no aggressive measures, but only\nplacarded the walls with somewhat vague appeals to the workmen not to\nallow themselves to be trampled upon.  However, they called a meeting in\nTrafalgar Square for the day fortnight of the last-mentioned skirmish.\n\n\"Meantime the town grew no quieter, and business came pretty much to an\nend.  The newspapers--then, as always hitherto, almost entirely in the\nhands of the masters--clamoured to the Government for repressive\nmeasures; the rich citizens were enrolled as an extra body of police, and\narmed with bludgeons like them; many of these were strong, well-fed, full-\nblooded young men, and had plenty of stomach for fighting; but the\nGovernment did not dare to use them, and contented itself with getting\nfull powers voted to it by the Parliament for suppressing any revolt, and\nbringing up more and more soldiers to London.  Thus passed the week after\nthe great meeting; almost as large a one was held on the Sunday, which\nwent off peaceably on the whole, as no opposition to it was offered, and\nagain the people cried 'victory.'  But on the Monday the people woke up\nto find that they were hungry.  During the last few days there had been\ngroups of men parading the streets asking (or, if you please, demanding)\nmoney to buy food; and what for goodwill, what for fear, the richer\npeople gave them a good deal.  The authorities of the parishes also (I\nhaven't time to explain that phrase at present) gave willy-nilly what\nprovisions they could to wandering people; and the Government, by means\nof its feeble national workshops, also fed a good number of half-starved\nfolk.  But in addition to this, several bakers' shops and other provision\nstores had been emptied without a great deal of disturbance.  So far, so\ngood.  But on the Monday in question the Committee of Public Safety, on\nthe one hand afraid of general unorganised pillage, and on the other\nemboldened by the wavering conduct of the authorities, sent a deputation\nprovided with carts and all necessary gear to clear out two or three big\nprovision stores in the centre of the town, leaving papers with the shop\nmanagers promising to pay the price of them: and also in the part of the\ntown where they were strongest they took possession of several bakers'\nshops and set men at work in them for the benefit of the people;--all of\nwhich was done with little or no disturbance, the police assisting in\nkeeping order at the sack of the stores, as they would have done at a big\nfire.\n\n\"But at this last stroke the reactionaries were so alarmed, that they\nwere, determined to force the executive into action.  The newspapers next\nday all blazed into the fury of frightened people, and threatened the\npeople, the Government, and everybody they could think of, unless 'order\nwere at once restored.'  A deputation of leading commercial people waited\non the Government and told them that if they did not at once arrest the\nCommittee of Public Safety, they themselves would gather a body of men,\narm them, and fall on 'the incendiaries,' as they called them.\n\n\"They, together with a number of the newspaper editors, had a long\ninterview with the heads of the Government and two or three military men,\nthe deftest in their art that the country could furnish.  The deputation\ncame away from that interview, says a contemporary eye-witness, smiling\nand satisfied, and said no more about raising an anti-popular army, but\nthat afternoon left London with their families for their country seats or\nelsewhere.\n\n\"The next morning the Government proclaimed a state of siege in London,--a\nthing common enough amongst the absolutist governments on the Continent,\nbut unheard-of in England in those days.  They appointed the youngest and\ncleverest of their generals to command the proclaimed district; a man who\nhad won a certain sort of reputation in the disgraceful wars in which the\ncountry had been long engaged from time to time.  The newspapers were in\necstacies, and all the most fervent of the reactionaries now came to the\nfront; men who in ordinary times were forced to keep their opinions to\nthemselves or their immediate circle, but who began to look forward to\ncrushing once for all the Socialist, and even democratic tendencies,\nwhich, said they, had been treated with such foolish indulgence for the\nlast sixty years.\n\n\"But the clever general took no visible action; and yet only a few of the\nminor newspapers abused him; thoughtful men gathered from this that a\nplot was hatching.  As for the Committee of Public Safety, whatever they\nthought of their position, they had now gone too far to draw back; and\nmany of them, it seems, thought that the government would not act.  They\nwent on quietly organising their food supply, which was a miserable\ndriblet when all is said; and also as a retort to the state of siege,\nthey armed as many men as they could in the quarter where they were\nstrongest, but did not attempt to drill or organise them, thinking,\nperhaps, that they could not at the best turn them into trained soldiers\ntill they had some breathing space.  The clever general, his soldiers,\nand the police did not meddle with all this in the least in the world;\nand things were quieter in London that week-end; though there were riots\nin many places of the provinces, which were quelled by the authorities\nwithout much trouble.  The most serious of these were at Glasgow and\nBristol.\n\n\"Well, the Sunday of the meeting came, and great crowds came to Trafalgar\nSquare in procession, the greater part of the Committee amongst them,\nsurrounded by their band of men armed somehow or other.  The streets were\nquite peaceful and quiet, though there were many spectators to see the\nprocession pass.  Trafalgar Square had no body of police in it; the\npeople took quiet possession of it, and the meeting began.  The armed men\nstood round the principal platform, and there were a few others armed\namidst the general crowd; but by far the greater part were unarmed.\n\n\"Most people thought the meeting would go off peaceably; but the members\nof the Committee had heard from various quarters that something would be\nattempted against them; but these rumours were vague, and they had no\nidea of what threatened.  They soon found out.\n\n\"For before the streets about the Square were filled, a body of soldiers\npoured into it from the north-west corner and took up their places by the\nhouses that stood on the west side.  The people growled at the sight of\nthe red-coats; the armed men of the Committee stood undecided, not\nknowing what to do; and indeed this new influx so jammed the crowd\ntogether that, unorganised as they were, they had little chance of\nworking through it.  They had scarcely grasped the fact of their enemies\nbeing there, when another column of soldiers, pouring out of the streets\nwhich led into the great southern road going down to the Parliament House\n(still existing, and called the Dung Market), and also from the\nembankment by the side of the Thames, marched up, pushing the crowd into\na denser and denser mass, and formed along the south side of the Square.\nThen any of those who could see what was going on, knew at once that they\nwere in a trap, and could only wonder what would be done with them.\n\n\"The closely-packed crowd would not or could not budge, except under the\ninfluence of the height of terror, which was soon to be supplied to them.\nA few of the armed men struggled to the front, or climbled up to the base\nof the monument which then stood there, that they might face the wall of\nhidden fire before them; and to most men (there were many women amongst\nthem) it seemed as if the end of the world had come, and to-day seemed\nstrangely different from yesterday.  No sooner were the soldiers drawn up\naforesaid than, says an eye-witness, 'a glittering officer on horseback\ncame prancing out from the ranks on the south, and read something from a\npaper which he held in his hand; which something, very few heard; but I\nwas told afterwards that it was an order for us to disperse, and a\nwarning that he had legal right to fire on the crowd else, and that he\nwould do so.  The crowd took it as a challenge of some sort, and a hoarse\nthreatening roar went up from them; and after that there was comparative\nsilence for a little, till the officer had got back into the ranks.  I\nwas near the edge of the crowd, towards the soldiers,' says this\neye-witness, 'and I saw three little machines being wheeled out in front\nof the ranks, which I knew for mechanical guns.  I cried out, \"Throw\nyourselves down! they are going to fire!\"  But no one scarcely could\nthrow himself down, so tight as the crowd were packed.  I heard a sharp\norder given, and wondered where I should be the next minute; and then--It\nwas as if--the earth had opened, and hell had come up bodily amidst us.\nIt is no use trying to describe the scene that followed.  Deep lanes were\nmowed amidst the thick crowd; the dead and dying covered the ground, and\nthe shrieks and wails and cries of horror filled all the air, till it\nseemed as if there were nothing else in the world but murder and death.\nThose of our armed men who were still unhurt cheered wildly and opened a\nscattering fire on the soldiers.  One or two soldiers fell; and I saw the\nofficers going up and down the ranks urging the men to fire again; but\nthey received the orders in sullen silence, and let the butts of their\nguns fall.  Only one sergeant ran to a machine-gun and began to set it\ngoing; but a tall young man, an officer too, ran out of the ranks and\ndragged him back by the collar; and the soldiers stood there motionless\nwhile the horror-stricken crowd, nearly wholly unarmed (for most of the\narmed men had fallen in that first discharge), drifted out of the Square.\nI was told afterwards that the soldiers on the west side had fired also,\nand done their part of the slaughter.  How I got out of the Square I\nscarcely know: I went, not feeling the ground under me, what with rage\nand terror and despair.'\n\n\"So says our eye-witness.  The number of the slain on the side of the\npeople in that shooting during a minute was prodigious; but it was not\neasy to come at the truth about it; it was probably between one and two\nthousand.  Of the soldiers, six were killed outright, and a dozen\nwounded.\"\n\nI listened, trembling with excitement.  The old man's eyes glittered and\nhis face flushed as he spoke, and told the tale of what I had often\nthought might happen.  Yet I wondered that he should have got so elated\nabout a mere massacre, and I said:\n\n\"How fearful!  And I suppose that this massacre put an end to the whole\nrevolution for that time?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried old Hammond; \"it began it!\"\n\nHe filled his glass and mine, and stood up and cried out, \"Drink this\nglass to the memory of those who died there, for indeed it would be a\nlong tale to tell how much we owe them.\"\n\nI drank, and he sat down again and went on.\n\n\"That massacre of Trafalgar Square began the civil war, though, like all\nsuch events, it gathered head slowly, and people scarcely knew what a\ncrisis they were acting in.\n\n\"Terrible as the massacre was, and hideous and overpowering as the first\nterror had been, when the people had time to think about it, their\nfeeling was one of anger rather than fear; although the military\norganisation of the state of siege was now carried out without shrinking\nby the clever young general.  For though the ruling-classes when the news\nspread next morning felt one gasp of horror and even dread, yet the\nGovernment and their immediate backers felt that now the wine was drawn\nand must be drunk.  However, even the most reactionary of the capitalist\npapers, with two exceptions, stunned by the tremendous news, simply gave\nan account of what had taken place, without making any comment upon it.\nThe exceptions were one, a so-called 'liberal' paper (the Government of\nthe day was of that complexion), which, after a preamble in which it\ndeclared its undeviating sympathy with the cause of labour, proceeded to\npoint out that in times of revolutionary disturbance it behoved the\nGovernment to be just but firm, and that by far the most merciful way of\ndealing with the poor madmen who were attacking the very foundations of\nsociety (which had made them mad and poor) was to shoot them at once, so\nas to stop others from drifting into a position in which they would run a\nchance of being shot.  In short, it praised the determined action of the\nGovernment as the acme of human wisdom and mercy, and exulted in the\ninauguration of an epoch of reasonable democracy free from the tyrannical\nfads of Socialism.\n\n\"The other exception was a paper thought to be one of the most violent\nopponents of democracy, and so it was; but the editor of it found his\nmanhood, and spoke for himself and not for his paper.  In a few simple,\nindignant words he asked people to consider what a society was worth\nwhich had to be defended by the massacre of unarmed citizens, and called\non the Government to withdraw their state of siege and put the general\nand his officers who fired on the people on their trial for murder.  He\nwent further, and declared that whatever his opinion might be as to the\ndoctrines of the Socialists, he for one should throw in his lot with the\npeople, until the Government atoned for their atrocity by showing that\nthey were prepared to listen to the demands of men who knew what they\nwanted, and whom the decrepitude of society forced into pushing their\ndemands in some way or other.\n\n\"Of course, this editor was immediately arrested by the military power;\nbut his bold words were already in the hands of the public, and produced\na great effect: so great an effect that the Government, after some\nvacillation, withdrew the state of siege; though at the same time it\nstrengthened the military organisation and made it more stringent.  Three\nof the Committee of Public Safety had been slain in Trafalgar Square: of\nthe rest the greater part went back to their old place of meeting, and\nthere awaited the event calmly.  They were arrested there on the Monday\nmorning, and would have been shot at once by the general, who was a mere\nmilitary machine, if the Government had not shrunk before the\nresponsibility of killing men without any trial.  There was at first a\ntalk of trying them by a special commission of judges, as it was\ncalled--_i.e._, before a set of men bound to find them guilty, and whose\nbusiness it was to do so.  But with the Government the cold fit had\nsucceeded to the hot one; and the prisoners were brought before a jury at\nthe assizes.  There a fresh blow awaited the Government; for in spite of\nthe judge's charge, which distinctly instructed the jury to find the\nprisoners guilty, they were acquitted, and the jury added to their\nverdict a presentment, in which they condemned the action of the\nsoldiery, in the queer phraseology of the day, as 'rash, unfortunate, and\nunnecessary.'  The Committee of Public Safety renewed its sittings, and\nfrom thenceforth was a popular rallying-point in opposition to the\nParliament.  The Government now gave way on all sides, and made a show of\nyielding to the demands of the people, though there was a widespread plot\nfor effecting a coup d'etat set on foot between the leaders of the two so-\ncalled opposing parties in the parliamentary faction fight.  The well-\nmeaning part of the public was overjoyed, and thought that all danger of\na civil war was over.  The victory of the people was celebrated by huge\nmeetings held in the parks and elsewhere, in memory of the victims of the\ngreat massacre.\n\n\"But the measures passed for the relief of the workers, though to the\nupper classes they seemed ruinously revolutionary, were not thorough\nenough to give the people food and a decent life, and they had to be\nsupplemented by unwritten enactments without legality to back them.\nAlthough the Government and Parliament had the law-courts, the army, and\n'society' at their backs, the Committee of Public Safety began to be a\nforce in the country, and really represented the producing classes.  It\nbegan to improve immensely in the days which followed on the acquittal of\nits members.  Its old members had little administrative capacity, though\nwith the exception of a few self-seekers and traitors, they were honest,\ncourageous men, and many of them were endowed with considerable talent of\nother kinds.  But now that the times called for immediate action, came\nforward the men capable of setting it on foot; and a new network of\nworkmen's associations grew up very speedily, whose avowed single object\nwas the tiding over of the ship of the community into a simple condition\nof Communism; and as they practically undertook also the management of\nthe ordinary labour-war, they soon became the mouthpiece and intermediary\nof the whole of the working classes; and the manufacturing\nprofit-grinders now found themselves powerless before this combination;\nunless _their_ committee, Parliament, plucked up courage to begin the\ncivil war again, and to shoot right and left, they were bound to yield to\nthe demands of the men whom they employed, and pay higher and higher\nwages for shorter and shorter day's work.  Yet one ally they had, and\nthat was the rapidly approaching breakdown of the whole system founded on\nthe World-Market and its supply; which now became so clear to all people,\nthat the middle classes, shocked for the moment into condemnation of the\nGovernment for the great massacre, turned round nearly in a mass, and\ncalled on the Government to look to matters, and put an end to the\ntyranny of the Socialist leaders.\n\n\"Thus stimulated, the reactionist plot exploded probably before it was\nripe; but this time the people and their leaders were forewarned, and,\nbefore the reactionaries could get under way, had taken the steps they\nthought necessary.\n\n\"The Liberal Government (clearly by collusion) was beaten by the\nConservatives, though the latter were nominally much in the minority.  The\npopular representatives in the House understood pretty well what this\nmeant, and after an attempt to fight the matter out by divisions in the\nHouse of Commons, they made a protest, left the House, and came in a body\nto the Committee of Public Safety: and the civil war began again in good\nearnest.\n\n\"Yet its first act was not one of mere fighting.  The new Tory Government\ndetermined to act, yet durst not re-enact the state of siege, but it sent\na body of soldiers and police to arrest the Committee of Public Safety in\nthe lump.  They made no resistance, though they might have done so, as\nthey had now a considerable body of men who were quite prepared for\nextremities.  But they were determined to try first a weapon which they\nthought stronger than street fighting.\n\n\"The members of the Committee went off quietly to prison; but they had\nleft their soul and their organisation behind them.  For they depended\nnot on a carefully arranged centre with all kinds of checks and counter-\nchecks about it, but on a huge mass of people in thorough sympathy with\nthe movement, bound together by a great number of links of small centres\nwith very simple instructions.  These instructions were now carried out.\n\n\"The next morning, when the leaders of the reaction were chuckling at the\neffect which the report in the newspapers of their stroke would have upon\nthe public--no newspapers appeared; and it was only towards noon that a\nfew straggling sheets, about the size of the gazettes of the seventeenth\ncentury, worked by policemen, soldiers, managers, and press-writers, were\ndribbled through the streets.  They were greedily seized on and read; but\nby this time the serious part of their news was stale, and people did not\nneed to be told that the GENERAL STRIKE had begun.  The railways did not\nrun, the telegraph-wires were unserved; flesh, fish, and green stuff\nbrought to market was allowed to lie there still packed and perishing;\nthe thousands of middle-class families, who were utterly dependant for\nthe next meal on the workers, made frantic efforts through their more\nenergetic members to cater for the needs of the day, and amongst those of\nthem who could throw off the fear of what was to follow, there was, I am\ntold, a certain enjoyment of this unexpected picnic--a forecast of the\ndays to come, in which all labour grew pleasant.\n\n\"So passed the first day, and towards evening the Government grew quite\ndistracted.  They had but one resource for putting down any popular\nmovement--to wit, mere brute-force; but there was nothing for them\nagainst which to use their army and police: no armed bodies appeared in\nthe streets; the offices of the Federated Workmen were now, in\nappearance, at least, turned into places for the relief of people thrown\nout of work, and under the circumstances, they durst not arrest the men\nengaged in such business, all the more, as even that night many quite\nrespectable people applied at these offices for relief, and swallowed\ndown the charity of the revolutionists along with their supper.  So the\nGovernment massed soldiers and police here and there--and sat still for\nthat night, fully expecting on the morrow some manifesto from 'the\nrebels,' as they now began to be called, which would give them an\nopportunity of acting in some way or another.  They were disappointed.\nThe ordinary newspapers gave up the struggle that morning, and only one\nvery violent reactionary paper (called the _Daily Telegraph_) attempted\nan appearance, and rated 'the rebels' in good set terms for their folly\nand ingratitude in tearing out the bowels of their 'common mother,' the\nEnglish Nation, for the benefit of a few greedy paid agitators, and the\nfools whom they were deluding.  On the other hand, the Socialist papers\n(of which three only, representing somewhat different schools, were\npublished in London) came out full to the throat of well-printed matter.\nThey were greedily bought by the whole public, who, of course, like the\nGovernment, expected a manifesto in them.  But they found no word of\nreference to the great subject.  It seemed as if their editors had\nransacked their drawers for articles which would have been in place forty\nyears before, under the technical name of educational articles.  Most of\nthese were admirable and straightforward expositions of the doctrines and\npractice of Socialism, free from haste and spite and hard words, and came\nupon the public with a kind of May-day freshness, amidst the worry and\nterror of the moment; and though the knowing well understood that the\nmeaning of this move in the game was mere defiance, and a token of\nirreconcilable hostility to the then rulers of society, and though, also,\nthey were meant for nothing else by 'the rebels,' yet they really had\ntheir effect as 'educational articles.'  However, 'education' of another\nkind was acting upon the public with irresistible power, and probably\ncleared their heads a little.\n\n\"As to the Government, they were absolutely terrified by this act of\n'boycotting' (the slang word then current for such acts of abstention).\nTheir counsels became wild and vacillating to the last degree: one hour\nthey were for giving way for the present till they could hatch another\nplot; the next they all but sent an order for the arrest in the lump of\nall the workmen's committees; the next they were on the point of ordering\ntheir brisk young general to take any excuse that offered for another\nmassacre.  But when they called to mind that the soldiery in that\n'Battle' of Trafalgar Square were so daunted by the slaughter which they\nhad made, that they could not be got to fire a second volley, they shrank\nback again from the dreadful courage necessary for carrying out another\nmassacre.  Meantime the prisoners, brought the second time before the\nmagistrates under a strong escort of soldiers, were the second time\nremanded.\n\n\"The strike went on this day also.  The workmen's committees were\nextended, and gave relief to great numbers of people, for they had\norganised a considerable amount of production of food by men whom they\ncould depend upon.  Quite a number of well-to-do people were now\ncompelled to seek relief of them.  But another curious thing happened: a\nband of young men of the upper classes armed themselves, and coolly went\nmarauding in the streets, taking what suited them of such eatables and\nportables that they came across in the shops which had ventured to open.\nThis operation they carried out in Oxford Street, then a great street of\nshops of all kinds.  The Government, being at that hour in one of their\nyielding moods, thought this a fine opportunity for showing their\nimpartiality in the maintenance of 'order,' and sent to arrest these\nhungry rich youths; who, however, surprised the police by a valiant\nresistance, so that all but three escaped.  The Government did not gain\nthe reputation for impartiality which they expected from this move; for\nthey forgot that there were no evening papers; and the account of the\nskirmish spread wide indeed, but in a distorted form for it was mostly\ntold simply as an exploit of the starving people from the East-end; and\neverybody thought it was but natural for the Government to put them down\nwhen and where they could.\n\n\"That evening the rebel prisoners were visited in their cells by _very_\npolite and sympathetic persons, who pointed out to them what a suicidal\ncourse they were following, and how dangerous these extreme courses were\nfor the popular cause.  Says one of the prisoners: 'It was great sport\ncomparing notes when we came out anent the attempt of the Government to\n\"get at\" us separately in prison, and how we answered the blandishments\nof the highly \"intelligent and refined\" persons set on to pump us.  One\nlaughed; another told extravagant long-bow stories to the envoy; a third\nheld a sulky silence; a fourth damned the polite spy and bade him hold\nhis jaw--and that was all they got out of us.'\n\n\"So passed the second day of the great strike.  It was clear to all\nthinking people that the third day would bring on the crisis; for the\npresent suspense and ill-concealed terror was unendurable.  The ruling\nclasses, and the middle-class non-politicians who had been their real\nstrength and support, were as sheep lacking a shepherd; they literally\ndid not know what to do.\n\n\"One thing they found they had to do: try to get the 'rebels' to do\nsomething.  So the next morning, the morning of the third day of the\nstrike, when the members of the Committee of Public Safety appeared again\nbefore the magistrate, they found themselves treated with the greatest\npossible courtesy--in fact, rather as envoys and ambassadors than\nprisoners.  In short, the magistrate had received his orders; and with no\nmore to do than might come of a long stupid speech, which might have been\nwritten by Dickens in mockery, he discharged the prisoners, who went back\nto their meeting-place and at once began a due sitting.  It was high\ntime.  For this third day the mass was fermenting indeed.  There was, of\ncourse, a vast number of working people who were not organised in the\nleast in the world; men who had been used to act as their masters drove\nthem, or rather as the system drove, of which their masters were a part.\nThat system was now falling to pieces, and the old pressure of the master\nhaving been taken off these poor men, it seemed likely that nothing but\nthe mere animal necessities and passions of men would have any hold on\nthem, and that mere general overturn would be the result.  Doubtless this\nwould have happened if it had not been that the huge mass had been\nleavened by Socialist opinion in the first place, and in the second by\nactual contact with declared Socialists, many or indeed most of whom were\nmembers of those bodies of workmen above said.\n\nIf anything of this kind had happened some years before, when the masters\nof labour were still looked upon as the natural rulers of the people, and\neven the poorest and most ignorant man leaned upon them for support,\nwhile they submitted to their fleecing, the entire break-up of all\nsociety would have followed.  But the long series of years during which\nthe workmen had learned to despise their rulers, had done away with their\ndependence upon them, and they were now beginning to trust (somewhat\ndangerously, as events proved) in the non-legal leaders whom events had\nthrust forward; and though most of these were now become mere\nfigure-heads, their names and reputations were useful in this crisis as a\nstop-gap.\n\n\"The effect of the news, therefore, of the release of the Committee gave\nthe Government some breathing time: for it was received with the greatest\njoy by the workers, and even the well-to-do saw in it a respite from the\nmere destruction which they had begun to dread, and the fear of which\nmost of them attributed to the weakness of the Government.  As far as the\npassing hour went, perhaps they were right in this.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" said I.  \"What could the Government have done?  I\noften used to think that they would be helpless in such a crisis.\"\n\nSaid old Hammond: \"Of course I don't doubt that in the long run matters\nwould have come about as they did.  But if the Government could have\ntreated their army as a real army, and used them strategically as a\ngeneral would have done, looking on the people as a mere open enemy to be\nshot at and dispersed wherever they turned up, they would probably have\ngained the victory at the time.\"\n\n\"But would the soldiers have acted against the people in this way?\" said\nI.\n\nSaid he: \"I think from all I have heard that they would have done so if\nthey had met bodies of men armed however badly, and however badly they\nhad been organised.  It seems also as if before the Trafalgar Square\nmassacre they might as a whole have been depended upon to fire upon an\nunarmed crowd, though they were much honeycombed by Socialism.  The\nreason for this was that they dreaded the use by apparently unarmed men\nof an explosive called dynamite, of which many loud boasts were made by\nthe workers on the eve of these events; although it turned out to be of\nlittle use as a material for war in the way that was expected.  Of course\nthe officers of the soldiery fanned this fear to the utmost, so that the\nrank and file probably thought on that occasion that they were being led\ninto a desperate battle with men who were really armed, and whose weapon\nwas the more dreadful, because it was concealed.  After that massacre,\nhowever, it was at all times doubtful if the regular soldiers would fire\nupon an unarmed or half-armed crowd.\"\n\nSaid I: \"The regular soldiers?  Then there were other combatants against\nthe people?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"we shall come to that presently.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I said, \"you had better go on straight with your story.  I\nsee that time is wearing.\"\n\nSaid Hammond: \"The Government lost no time in coming to terms with the\nCommittee of Public Safety; for indeed they could think of nothing else\nthan the danger of the moment.  They sent a duly accredited envoy to\ntreat with these men, who somehow had obtained dominion over people's\nminds, while the formal rulers had no hold except over their bodies.\nThere is no need at present to go into the details of the truce (for such\nit was) between these high contracting parties, the Government of the\nempire of Great Britain and a handful of working-men (as they were called\nin scorn in those days), amongst whom, indeed, were some very capable and\n'square-headed' persons, though, as aforesaid, the abler men were not\nthen the recognised leaders.  The upshot of it was that all the definite\nclaims of the people had to be granted.  We can now see that most of\nthese claims were of themselves not worth either demanding or resisting;\nbut they were looked on at that time as most important, and they were at\nleast tokens of revolt against the miserable system of life which was\nthen beginning to tumble to pieces.  One claim, however, was of the\nutmost immediate importance, and this the Government tried hard to evade;\nbut as they were not dealing with fools, they had to yield at last.  This\nwas the claim of recognition and formal status for the Committee of\nPublic Safety, and all the associations which it fostered under its wing.\nThis it is clear meant two things: first, amnesty for 'the rebels,' great\nand small, who, without a distinct act of civil war, could no longer be\nattacked; and next, a continuance of the organised revolution.  Only one\npoint the Government could gain, and that was a name.  The dreadful\nrevolutionary title was dropped, and the body, with its branches, acted\nunder the respectable name of the 'Board of Conciliation and its local\noffices.'  Carrying this name, it became the leader of the people in the\ncivil war which soon followed.\"\n\n\"O,\" said I, somewhat startled, \"so the civil war went on, in spite of\nall that had happened?\"\n\n\"So it was,\" said he.  \"In fact, it was this very legal recognition which\nmade the civil war possible in the ordinary sense of war; it took the\nstruggle out of the element of mere massacres on one side, and endurance\nplus strikes on the other.\"\n\n\"And can you tell me in what kind of way the war was carried on?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes\" he said; \"we have records and to spare of all that; and the essence\nof them I can give you in a few words.  As I told you, the rank and file\nof the army was not to be trusted by the reactionists; but the officers\ngenerally were prepared for anything, for they were mostly the very\nstupidest men in the country.  Whatever the Government might do, a great\npart of the upper and middle classes were determined to set on foot a\ncounter revolution; for the Communism which now loomed ahead seemed quite\nunendurable to them.  Bands of young men, like the marauders in the great\nstrike of whom I told you just now, armed themselves and drilled, and\nbegan on any opportunity or pretence to skirmish with the people in the\nstreets.  The Government neither helped them nor put them down, but stood\nby, hoping that something might come of it.  These 'Friends of Order,' as\nthey were called, had some successes at first, and grew bolder; they got\nmany officers of the regular army to help them, and by their means laid\nhold of munitions of war of all kinds.  One part of their tactics\nconsisted in their guarding and even garrisoning the big factories of the\nperiod: they held at one time, for instance, the whole of that place\ncalled Manchester which I spoke of just now.  A sort of irregular war was\ncarried on with varied success all over the country; and at last the\nGovernment, which at first pretended to ignore the struggle, or treat it\nas mere rioting, definitely declared for 'the Friends of Order,' and\njoined to their bands whatsoever of the regular army they could get\ntogether, and made a desperate effort to overwhelm 'the rebels,' as they\nwere now once more called, and as indeed they called themselves.\n\n\"It was too late.  All ideas of peace on a basis of compromise had\ndisappeared on either side.  The end, it was seen clearly, must be either\nabsolute slavery for all but the privileged, or a system of life founded\non equality and Communism.  The sloth, the hopelessness, and if I may say\nso, the cowardice of the last century, had given place to the eager,\nrestless heroism of a declared revolutionary period.  I will not say that\nthe people of that time foresaw the life we are leading now, but there\nwas a general instinct amongst them towards the essential part of that\nlife, and many men saw clearly beyond the desperate struggle of the day\ninto the peace which it was to bring about.  The men of that day who were\non the side of freedom were not unhappy, I think, though they were\nharassed by hopes and fears, and sometimes torn by doubts, and the\nconflict of duties hard to reconcile.\"\n\n\"But how did the people, the revolutionists, carry on the war?  What were\nthe elements of success on their side?\"\n\nI put this question, because I wanted to bring the old man back to the\ndefinite history, and take him out of the musing mood so natural to an\nold man.\n\nHe answered: \"Well, they did not lack organisers; for the very conflict\nitself, in days when, as I told you, men of any strength of mind cast\naway all consideration for the ordinary business of life, developed the\nnecessary talent amongst them.  Indeed, from all I have read and heard, I\nmuch doubt whether, without this seemingly dreadful civil war, the due\ntalent for administration would have been developed amongst the working\nmen.  Anyhow, it was there, and they soon got leaders far more than equal\nto the best men amongst the reactionaries.  For the rest, they had no\ndifficulty about the material of their army; for that revolutionary\ninstinct so acted on the ordinary soldier in the ranks that the greater\npart, certainly the best part, of the soldiers joined the side of the\npeople.  But the main element of their success was this, that wherever\nthe working people were not coerced, they worked, not for the\nreactionists, but for 'the rebels.'  The reactionists could get no work\ndone for them outside the districts where they were all-powerful: and\neven in those districts they were harassed by continual risings; and in\nall cases and everywhere got nothing done without obstruction and black\nlooks and sulkiness; so that not only were their armies quite worn out\nwith the difficulties which they had to meet, but the non-combatants who\nwere on their side were so worried and beset with hatred and a thousand\nlittle troubles and annoyances that life became almost unendurable to\nthem on those terms.  Not a few of them actually died of the worry; many\ncommitted suicide.  Of course, a vast number of them joined actively in\nthe cause of reaction, and found some solace to their misery in the\neagerness of conflict.  Lastly, many thousands gave way and submitted to\n'the rebels'; and as the numbers of these latter increased, it at last\nbecame clear to all men that the cause which was once hopeless, was now\ntriumphant, and that the hopeless cause was that of slavery and\nprivilege.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII: THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW LIFE\n\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"so you got clear out of all your trouble.  Were people\nsatisfied with the new order of things when it came?\"\n\n\"People?\" he said.  \"Well, surely all must have been glad of peace when\nit came; especially when they found, as they must have found, that after\nall, they--even the once rich--were not living very badly.  As to those\nwho had been poor, all through the war, which lasted about two years,\ntheir condition had been bettering, in spite of the struggle; and when\npeace came at last, in a very short time they made great strides towards\na decent life.  The great difficulty was that the once-poor had such a\nfeeble conception of the real pleasure of life: so to say, they did not\nask enough, did not know how to ask enough, from the new state of things.\nIt was perhaps rather a good than an evil thing that the necessity for\nrestoring the wealth destroyed during the war forced them into working at\nfirst almost as hard as they had been used to before the Revolution.  For\nall historians are agreed that there never was a war in which there was\nso much destruction of wares, and instruments for making them as in this\ncivil war.\"\n\n\"I am rather surprised at that,\" said I.\n\n\"Are you?  I don't see why,\" said Hammond.\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"because the party of order would surely look upon the\nwealth as their own property, no share of which, if they could help it,\nshould go to their slaves, supposing they conquered.  And on the other\nhand, it was just for the possession of that wealth that 'the rebels'\nwere fighting, and I should have thought, especially when they saw that\nthey were winning, that they would have been careful to destroy as little\nas possible of what was so soon to be their own.\"\n\n\"It was as I have told you, however,\" said he.  \"The party of order, when\nthey recovered from their first cowardice of surprise--or, if you please,\nwhen they fairly saw that, whatever happened, they would be ruined,\nfought with great bitterness, and cared little what they did, so long as\nthey injured the enemies who had destroyed the sweets of life for them.\nAs to 'the rebels,' I have told you that the outbreak of actual war made\nthem careless of trying to save the wretched scraps of wealth that they\nhad.  It was a common saying amongst them, Let the country be cleared of\neverything except valiant living men, rather than that we fall into\nslavery again!\"\n\nHe sat silently thinking a little while, and then said:\n\n\"When the conflict was once really begun, it was seen how little of any\nvalue there was in the old world of slavery and inequality.  Don't you\nsee what it means?  In the times which you are thinking of, and of which\nyou seem to know so much, there was no hope; nothing but the dull jog of\nthe mill-horse under compulsion of collar and whip; but in that fighting-\ntime that followed, all was hope: 'the rebels' at least felt themselves\nstrong enough to build up the world again from its dry bones,--and they\ndid it, too!\" said the old man, his eyes glittering under his beetling\nbrows.  He went on: \"And their opponents at least and at last learned\nsomething about the reality of life, and its sorrows, which they--their\nclass, I mean--had once known nothing of.  In short, the two combatants,\nthe workman and the gentleman, between them--\"\n\n\"Between them,\" said I, quickly, \"they destroyed commercialism!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" said he; \"that is it.  Nor could it have been destroyed\notherwise; except, perhaps, by the whole of society gradually falling\ninto lower depths, till it should at last reach a condition as rude as\nbarbarism, but lacking both the hope and the pleasures of barbarism.\nSurely the sharper, shorter remedy was the happiest.\"\n\n\"Most surely,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"the world was being brought to its second\nbirth; how could that take place without a tragedy?  Moreover, think of\nit.  The spirit of the new days, of our days, was to be delight in the\nlife of the world; intense and overweening love of the very skin and\nsurface of the earth on which man dwells, such as a lover has in the fair\nflesh of the woman he loves; this, I say, was to be the new spirit of the\ntime.  All other moods save this had been exhausted: the unceasing\ncriticism, the boundless curiosity in the ways and thoughts of man, which\nwas the mood of the ancient Greek, to whom these things were not so much\na means, as an end, was gone past recovery; nor had there been really any\nshadow of it in the so-called science of the nineteenth century, which,\nas you must know, was in the main an appendage to the commercial system;\nnay, not seldom an appendage to the police of that system.  In spite of\nappearances, it was limited and cowardly, because it did not really\nbelieve in itself.  It was the outcome, as it was the sole relief, of the\nunhappiness of the period which made life so bitter even to the rich, and\nwhich, as you may see with your bodily eyes, the great change has swept\naway.  More akin to our way of looking at life was the spirit of the\nMiddle Ages, to whom heaven and the life of the next world was such a\nreality, that it became to them a part of the life upon the earth; which\naccordingly they loved and adorned, in spite of the ascetic doctrines of\ntheir formal creed, which bade them contemn it.\n\n\"But that also, with its assured belief in heaven and hell as two\ncountries in which to live, has gone, and now we do, both in word and in\ndeed, believe in the continuous life of the world of men, and as it were,\nadd every day of that common life to the little stock of days which our\nown mere individual experience wins for us: and consequently we are\nhappy.  Do you wonder at it?  In times past, indeed, men were told to\nlove their kind, to believe in the religion of humanity, and so forth.\nBut look you, just in the degree that a man had elevation of mind and\nrefinement enough to be able to value this idea, was he repelled by the\nobvious aspect of the individuals composing the mass which he was to\nworship; and he could only evade that repulsion by making a conventional\nabstraction of mankind that had little actual or historical relation to\nthe race; which to his eyes was divided into blind tyrants on the one\nhand and apathetic degraded slaves on the other.  But now, where is the\ndifficulty in accepting the religion of humanity, when the men and women\nwho go to make up humanity are free, happy, and energetic at least, and\nmost commonly beautiful of body also, and surrounded by beautiful things\nof their own fashioning, and a nature bettered and not worsened by\ncontact with mankind?  This is what this age of the world has reserved\nfor us.\"\n\n\"It seems true,\" said I, \"or ought to be, if what my eyes have seen is a\ntoken of the general life you lead.  Can you now tell me anything of your\nprogress after the years of the struggle?\"\n\nSaid he: \"I could easily tell you more than you have time to listen to;\nbut I can at least hint at one of the chief difficulties which had to be\nmet: and that was, that when men began to settle down after the war, and\ntheir labour had pretty much filled up the gap in wealth caused by the\ndestruction of that war, a kind of disappointment seemed coming over us,\nand the prophecies of some of the reactionists of past times seemed as if\nthey would come true, and a dull level of utilitarian comfort be the end\nfor a while of our aspirations and success.  The loss of the competitive\nspur to exertion had not, indeed, done anything to interfere with the\nnecessary production of the community, but how if it should make men dull\nby giving them too much time for thought or idle musing?  But, after all,\nthis dull thunder-cloud only threatened us, and then passed over.\nProbably, from what I have told you before, you will have a guess at the\nremedy for such a disaster; remembering always that many of the things\nwhich used to be produced--slave-wares for the poor and mere\nwealth-wasting wares for the rich--ceased to be made.  That remedy was,\nin short, the production of what used to be called art, but which has no\nname amongst us now, because it has become a necessary part of the labour\nof every man who produces.\"\n\nSaid I: \"What! had men any time or opportunity for cultivating the fine\narts amidst the desperate struggle for life and freedom that you have\ntold me of?\"\n\nSaid Hammond: \"You must not suppose that the new form of art was founded\nchiefly on the memory of the art of the past; although, strange to say,\nthe civil war was much less destructive of art than of other things, and\nthough what of art existed under the old forms, revived in a wonderful\nway during the latter part of the struggle, especially as regards music\nand poetry.  The art or work-pleasure, as one ought to call it, of which\nI am now speaking, sprung up almost spontaneously, it seems, from a kind\nof instinct amongst people, no longer driven desperately to painful and\nterrible over-work, to do the best they could with the work in hand--to\nmake it excellent of its kind; and when that had gone on for a little, a\ncraving for beauty seemed to awaken in men's minds, and they began rudely\nand awkwardly to ornament the wares which they made; and when they had\nonce set to work at that, it soon began to grow.  All this was much\nhelped by the abolition of the squalor which our immediate ancestors put\nup with so coolly; and by the leisurely, but not stupid, country-life\nwhich now grew (as I told you before) to be common amongst us.  Thus at\nlast and by slow degrees we got pleasure into our work; then we became\nconscious of that pleasure, and cultivated it, and took care that we had\nour fill of it; and then all was gained, and we were happy.  So may it be\nfor ages and ages!\"\n\nThe old man fell into a reverie, not altogether without melancholy I\nthought; but I would not break it.  Suddenly he started, and said: \"Well,\ndear guest, here are come Dick and Clara to fetch you away, and there is\nan end of my talk; which I daresay you will not be sorry for; the long\nday is coming to an end, and you will have a pleasant ride back to\nHammersmith.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX: THE DRIVE BACK TO HAMMERSMITH\n\n\nI said nothing, for I was not inclined for mere politeness to him after\nsuch very serious talk; but in fact I should liked to have gone on\ntalking with the older man, who could understand something at least of my\nwonted ways of looking at life, whereas, with the younger people, in\nspite of all their kindness, I really was a being from another planet.\nHowever, I made the best of it, and smiled as amiably as I could on the\nyoung couple; and Dick returned the smile by saying, \"Well, guest, I am\nglad to have you again, and to find that you and my kinsman have not\nquite talked yourselves into another world; I was half suspecting as I\nwas listening to the Welshmen yonder that you would presently be\nvanishing away from us, and began to picture my kinsman sitting in the\nhall staring at nothing and finding that he had been talking a while past\nto nobody.\"\n\nI felt rather uncomfortable at this speech, for suddenly the picture of\nthe sordid squabble, the dirty and miserable tragedy of the life I had\nleft for a while, came before my eyes; and I had, as it were, a vision of\nall my longings for rest and peace in the past, and I loathed the idea of\ngoing back to it again.  But the old man chuckled and said:\n\n\"Don't be afraid, Dick.  In any case, I have not been talking to thin\nair; nor, indeed to this new friend of ours only.  Who knows but I may\nnot have been talking to many people?  For perhaps our guest may some day\ngo back to the people he has come from, and may take a message from us\nwhich may bear fruit for them, and consequently for us.\"\n\nDick looked puzzled, and said: \"Well, gaffer, I do not quite understand\nwhat you mean.  All I can say is, that I hope he will not leave us: for\ndon't you see, he is another kind of man to what we are used to, and\nsomehow he makes us think of all kind of things; and already I feel as if\nI could understand Dickens the better for having talked with him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clara, \"and I think in a few months we shall make him look\nyounger; and I should like to see what he was like with the wrinkles\nsmoothed out of his face.  Don't you think he will look younger after a\nlittle time with us?\"\n\nThe old man shook his head, and looked earnestly at me, but did not\nanswer her, and for a moment or two we were all silent.  Then Clara broke\nout:\n\n\"Kinsman, I don't like this: something or another troubles me, and I feel\nas if something untoward were going to happen.  You have been talking of\npast miseries to the guest, and have been living in past unhappy times,\nand it is in the air all round us, and makes us feel as if we were\nlonging for something that we cannot have.\"\n\nThe old man smiled on her kindly, and said: \"Well, my child, if that be\nso, go and live in the present, and you will soon shake it off.\" Then he\nturned to me, and said: \"Do you remember anything like that, guest, in\nthe country from which you come?\"\n\nThe lovers had turned aside now, and were talking together softly, and\nnot heeding us; so I said, but in a low voice: \"Yes, when I was a happy\nchild on a sunny holiday, and had everything that I could think of.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said he.  \"You remember just now you twitted me with living\nin the second childhood of the world.  You will find it a happy world to\nlive in; you will be happy there--for a while.\"\n\nAgain I did not like his scarcely veiled threat, and was beginning to\ntrouble myself with trying to remember how I had got amongst this curious\npeople, when the old man called out in a cheery voice: \"Now, my children,\ntake your guest away, and make much of him; for it is your business to\nmake him sleek of skin and peaceful of mind: he has by no means been as\nlucky as you have.  Farewell, guest!\" and he grasped my hand warmly.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said I, \"and thank you very much for all that you have told\nme.  I will come and see you as soon as I come back to London.  May I?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"come by all means--if you can.\"\n\n\"It won't be for some time yet,\" quoth Dick, in his cheery voice; \"for\nwhen the hay is in up the river, I shall be for taking him a round\nthrough the country between hay and wheat harvest, to see how our friends\nlive in the north country.  Then in the wheat harvest we shall do a good\nstroke of work, I should hope,--in Wiltshire by preference; for he will\nbe getting a little hard with all the open-air living, and I shall be as\ntough as nails.\"\n\n\"But you will take me along, won't you, Dick?\" said Clara, laying her\npretty hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Will I not?\" said Dick, somewhat boisterously.  \"And we will manage to\nsend you to bed pretty tired every night; and you will look so beautiful\nwith your neck all brown, and your hands too, and you under your gown as\nwhite as privet, that you will get some of those strange discontented\nwhims out of your head, my dear.  However, our week's haymaking will do\nall that for you.\"\n\nThe girl reddened very prettily, and not for shame but for pleasure; and\nthe old man laughed, and said:\n\n\"Guest, I see that you will be as comfortable as need be; for you need\nnot fear that those two will be too officious with you: they will be so\nbusy with each other, that they will leave you a good deal to yourself, I\nam sure, and that is a real kindness to a guest, after all.  O, you need\nnot be afraid of being one too many, either: it is just what these birds\nin a nest like, to have a good convenient friend to turn to, so that they\nmay relieve the ecstasies of love with the solid commonplace of\nfriendship.  Besides, Dick, and much more Clara, likes a little talking\nat times; and you know lovers do not talk unless they get into trouble,\nthey only prattle.  Good-bye, guest; may you be happy!\"\n\nClara went up to old Hammond, threw her arms about his neck and kissed\nhim heartily, and said:\n\n\"You are a dear old man, and may have your jest about me as much as you\nplease; and it won't be long before we see you again; and you may be sure\nwe shall make our guest happy; though, mind you, there is some truth in\nwhat you say.\"\n\nThen I shook hands again, and we went out of the hall and into the\ncloisters, and so in the street found Greylocks in the shafts waiting for\nus.  He was well looked after; for a little lad of about seven years old\nhad his hand on the rein and was solemnly looking up into his face; on\nhis back, withal, was a girl of fourteen, holding a three-year old sister\non before her; while another girl, about a year older than the boy, hung\non behind.  The three were occupied partly with eating cherries, partly\nwith patting and punching Greylocks, who took all their caresses in good\npart, but pricked up his ears when Dick made his appearance.  The girls\ngot off quietly, and going up to Clara, made much of her and snuggled up\nto her.  And then we got into the carriage, Dick shook the reins, and we\ngot under way at once, Greylocks trotting soberly between the lovely\ntrees of the London streets, that were sending floods of fragrance into\nthe cool evening air; for it was now getting toward sunset.\n\nWe could hardly go but fair and softly all the way, as there were a great\nmany people abroad in that cool hour.  Seeing so many people made me\nnotice their looks the more; and I must say, my taste, cultivated in the\nsombre greyness, or rather brownness, of the nineteenth century, was\nrather apt to condemn the gaiety and brightness of the raiment; and I\neven ventured to say as much to Clara.  She seemed rather surprised, and\neven slightly indignant, and said: \"Well, well, what's the matter?  They\nare not about any dirty work; they are only amusing themselves in the\nfine evening; there is nothing to foul their clothes.  Come, doesn't it\nall look very pretty?  It isn't gaudy, you know.\"\n\nIndeed that was true; for many of the people were clad in colours that\nwere sober enough, though beautiful, and the harmony of the colours was\nperfect and most delightful.\n\nI said, \"Yes, that is so; but how can everybody afford such costly\ngarments?  Look! there goes a middle-aged man in a sober grey dress; but\nI can see from here that it is made of very fine woollen stuff, and is\ncovered with silk embroidery.\"\n\nSaid Clara: \"He could wear shabby clothes if he pleased,--that is, if he\ndidn't think he would hurt people's feelings by doing so.\"\n\n\"But please tell me,\" said I, \"how can they afford it?\"\n\nAs soon as I had spoken I perceived that I had got back to my old\nblunder; for I saw Dick's shoulders shaking with laughter; but he\nwouldn't say a word, but handed me over to the tender mercies of Clara,\nwho said--\n\n\"Why, I don't know what you mean.  Of course we can afford it, or else we\nshouldn't do it.  It would be easy enough for us to say, we will only\nspend our labour on making our clothes comfortable: but we don't choose\nto stop there.  Why do you find fault with us?  Does it seem to you as if\nwe starved ourselves of food in order to make ourselves fine clothes?  Or\ndo you think there is anything wrong in liking to see the coverings of\nour bodies beautiful like our bodies are?--just as a deer's or an otter's\nskin has been made beautiful from the first?  Come, what is wrong with\nyou?\"\n\nI bowed before the storm, and mumbled out some excuse or other.  I must\nsay, I might have known that people who were so fond of architecture\ngenerally, would not be backward in ornamenting themselves; all the more\nas the shape of their raiment, apart from its colour, was both beautiful\nand reasonable--veiling the form, without either muffling or caricaturing\nit.\n\nClara was soon mollified; and as we drove along toward the wood before\nmentioned, she said to Dick--\n\n\"I tell you what, Dick: now that kinsman Hammond the Elder has seen our\nguest in his queer clothes, I think we ought to find him something decent\nto put on for our journey to-morrow: especially since, if we do not, we\nshall have to answer all sorts of questions as to his clothes and where\nthey came from.  Besides,\" she said slily, \"when he is clad in handsome\ngarments he will not be so quick to blame us for our childishness in\nwasting our time in making ourselves look pleasant to each other.\"\n\n\"All right, Clara,\" said Dick; \"he shall have everything that you--that\nhe wants to have.  I will look something out for him before he gets up to-\nmorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX: THE HAMMERSMITH GUEST-HOUSE AGAIN\n\n\nAmidst such talk, driving quietly through the balmy evening, we came to\nHammersmith, and were well received by our friends there.  Boffin, in a\nfresh suit of clothes, welcomed me back with stately courtesy; the weaver\nwanted to button-hole me and get out of me what old Hammond had said, but\nwas very friendly and cheerful when Dick warned him off; Annie shook\nhands with me, and hoped I had had a pleasant day--so kindly, that I felt\na slight pang as our hands parted; for to say the truth, I liked her\nbetter than Clara, who seemed to be always a little on the defensive,\nwhereas Annie was as frank as could be, and seemed to get honest pleasure\nfrom everything and everybody about her without the least effort.\n\nWe had quite a little feast that evening, partly in my honour, and\npartly, I suspect, though nothing was said about it, in honour of Dick\nand Clara coming together again.  The wine was of the best; the hall was\nredolent of rich summer flowers; and after supper we not only had music\n(Annie, to my mind, surpassing all the others for sweetness and clearness\nof voice, as well as for feeling and meaning), but at last we even got to\ntelling stories, and sat there listening, with no other light but that of\nthe summer moon streaming through the beautiful traceries of the windows,\nas if we had belonged to time long passed, when books were scarce and the\nart of reading somewhat rare.  Indeed, I may say here, that, though, as\nyou will have noted, my friends had mostly something to say about books,\nyet they were not great readers, considering the refinement of their\nmanners and the great amount of leisure which they obviously had.  In\nfact, when Dick, especially, mentioned a book, he did so with an air of a\nman who has accomplished an achievement; as much as to say, \"There, you\nsee, I have actually read that!\"\n\nThe evening passed all too quickly for me; since that day, for the first\ntime in my life, I was having my fill of the pleasure of the eyes without\nany of that sense of incongruity, that dread of approaching ruin, which\nhad always beset me hitherto when I had been amongst the beautiful works\nof art of the past, mingled with the lovely nature of the present; both\nof them, in fact, the result of the long centuries of tradition, which\nhad compelled men to produce the art, and compelled nature to run into\nthe mould of the ages.  Here I could enjoy everything without an\nafterthought of the injustice and miserable toil which made my leisure;\nthe ignorance and dulness of life which went to make my keen appreciation\nof history; the tyranny and the struggle full of fear and mishap which\nwent to make my romance.  The only weight I had upon my heart was a vague\nfear as it drew toward bed-time concerning the place wherein I should\nwake on the morrow: but I choked that down, and went to bed happy, and in\na very few moments was in a dreamless sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI: GOING UP THE RIVER\n\n\nWhen I did wake, to a beautiful sunny morning, I leapt out of bed with my\nover-night apprehension still clinging to me, which vanished delightfully\nhowever in a moment as I looked around my little sleeping chamber and saw\nthe pale but pure-coloured figures painted on the plaster of the wall,\nwith verses written underneath them which I knew somewhat over well.  I\ndressed speedily, in a suit of blue laid ready for me, so handsome that I\nquite blushed when I had got into it, feeling as I did so that excited\npleasure of anticipation of a holiday, which, well remembered as it was,\nI had not felt since I was a boy, new come home for the summer holidays.\n\nIt seemed quite early in the morning, and I expected to have the hall to\nmyself when I came into it out of the corridor wherein was my sleeping\nchamber; but I met Annie at once, who let fall her broom and gave me a\nkiss, quite meaningless I fear, except as betokening friendship, though\nshe reddened as she did it, not from shyness, but from friendly pleasure,\nand then stood and picked up her broom again, and went on with her\nsweeping, nodding to me as if to bid me stand out of the way and look on;\nwhich, to say the truth, I thought amusing enough, as there were five\nother girls helping her, and their graceful figures engaged in the\nleisurely work were worth going a long way to see, and their merry talk\nand laughing as they swept in quite a scientific manner was worth going a\nlong way to hear.  But Annie presently threw me back a word or two as she\nwent on to the other end of the hall: \"Guest,\" she said, \"I am glad that\nyou are up early, though we wouldn't disturb you; for our Thames is a\nlovely river at half-past six on a June morning: and as it would be a\npity for you to lose it, I am told just to give you a cup of milk and a\nbit of bread outside there, and put you into the boat: for Dick and Clara\nare all ready now.  Wait half a minute till I have swept down this row.\"\n\nSo presently she let her broom drop again, and came and took me by the\nhand and led me out on to the terrace above the river, to a little table\nunder the boughs, where my bread and milk took the form of as dainty a\nbreakfast as any one could desire, and then sat by me as I ate.  And in a\nminute or two Dick and Clara came to me, the latter looking most fresh\nand beautiful in a light silk embroidered gown, which to my unused eyes\nwas extravagantly gay and bright; while Dick was also handsomely dressed\nin white flannel prettily embroidered.  Clara raised her gown in her\nhands as she gave me the morning greeting, and said laughingly: \"Look,\nguest! you see we are at least as fine as any of the people you felt\ninclined to scold last night; you see we are not going to make the bright\nday and the flowers feel ashamed of themselves.  Now scold me!\"\n\nQuoth I: \"No, indeed; the pair of you seem as if you were born out of the\nsummer day itself; and I will scold you when I scold it.\"\n\n\"Well, you know,\" said Dick, \"this is a special day--all these days are,\nI mean.  The hay-harvest is in some ways better than corn-harvest because\nof the beautiful weather; and really, unless you had worked in the hay-\nfield in fine weather, you couldn't tell what pleasant work it is.  The\nwomen look so pretty at it, too,\" he said, shyly; \"so all things\nconsidered, I think we are right to adorn it in a simple manner.\"\n\n\"Do the women work at it in silk dresses?\" said I, smiling.\n\nDick was going to answer me soberly; but Clara put her hand over his\nmouth, and said, \"No, no, Dick; not too much information for him, or I\nshall think that you are your old kinsman again.  Let him find out for\nhimself: he will not have long to wait.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" quoth Annie, \"don't make your description of the picture too fine,\nor else he will be disappointed when the curtain is drawn.  I don't want\nhim to be disappointed.  But now it's time for you to be gone, if you are\nto have the best of the tide, and also of the sunny morning.  Good-bye,\nguest.\"\n\nShe kissed me in her frank friendly way, and almost took away from me my\ndesire for the expedition thereby; but I had to get over that, as it was\nclear that so delightful a woman would hardly be without a due lover of\nher own age.  We went down the steps of the landing stage, and got into a\npretty boat, not too light to hold us and our belongings comfortably, and\nhandsomely ornamented; and just as we got in, down came Boffin and the\nweaver to see us off.  The former had now veiled his splendour in a due\nsuit of working clothes, crowned with a fantail hat, which he took off,\nhowever, to wave us farewell with his grave old-Spanish-like courtesy.\nThen Dick pushed off into the stream, and bent vigorously to his sculls,\nand Hammersmith, with its noble trees and beautiful water-side houses,\nbegan to slip away from us.\n\nAs we went, I could not help putting beside his promised picture of the\nhay-field as it was then the picture of it as I remembered it, and\nespecially the images of the women engaged in the work rose up before me:\nthe row of gaunt figures, lean, flat-breasted, ugly, without a grace of\nform or face about them; dressed in wretched skimpy print gowns, and\nhideous flapping sun-bonnets, moving their rakes in a listless mechanical\nway.  How often had that marred the loveliness of the June day to me; how\noften had I longed to see the hay-fields peopled with men and women\nworthy of the sweet abundance of midsummer, of its endless wealth of\nbeautiful sights, and delicious sounds and scents.  And now, the world\nhad grown old and wiser, and I was to see my hope realised at last!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII: HAMPTON COURT AND A PRAISER OF PAST TIMES\n\n\nSo on we went, Dick rowing in an easy tireless way, and Clara sitting by\nmy side admiring his manly beauty and heartily good-natured face, and\nthinking, I fancy, of nothing else.  As we went higher up the river,\nthere was less difference between the Thames of that day and Thames as I\nremembered it; for setting aside the hideous vulgarity of the cockney\nvillas of the well-to-do, stockbrokers and other such, which in older\ntime marred the beauty of the bough-hung banks, even this beginning of\nthe country Thames was always beautiful; and as we slipped between the\nlovely summer greenery, I almost felt my youth come back to me, and as if\nI were on one of those water excursions which I used to enjoy so much in\ndays when I was too happy to think that there could be much amiss\nanywhere.\n\nAt last we came to a reach of the river where on the left hand a very\npretty little village with some old houses in it came down to the edge of\nthe water, over which was a ferry; and beyond these houses the elm-beset\nmeadows ended in a fringe of tall willows, while on the right hand went\nthe tow-path and a clear space before a row of trees, which rose up\nbehind huge and ancient, the ornaments of a great park: but these drew\nback still further from the river at the end of the reach to make way for\na little town of quaint and pretty houses, some new, some old, dominated\nby the long walls and sharp gables of a great red-brick pile of building,\npartly of the latest Gothic, partly of the court-style of Dutch William,\nbut so blended together by the bright sun and beautiful surroundings,\nincluding the bright blue river, which it looked down upon, that even\namidst the beautiful buildings of that new happy time it had a strange\ncharm about it.  A great wave of fragrance, amidst which the lime-tree\nblossom was clearly to be distinguished, came down to us from its unseen\ngardens, as Clara sat up in her place, and said:\n\n\"O Dick, dear, couldn't we stop at Hampton Court for to-day, and take the\nguest about the park a little, and show him those sweet old buildings?\nSomehow, I suppose because you have lived so near it, you have seldom\ntaken me to Hampton Court.\"\n\nDick rested on his oars a little, and said: \"Well, well, Clara, you are\nlazy to-day.  I didn't feel like stopping short of Shepperton for the\nnight; suppose we just go and have our dinner at the Court, and go on\nagain about five o'clock?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"so be it; but I should like the guest to have spent an\nhour or two in the Park.\"\n\n\"The Park!\" said Dick; \"why, the whole Thames-side is a park this time of\nthe year; and for my part, I had rather lie under an elm-tree on the\nborders of a wheat-field, with the bees humming about me and the corn-\ncrake crying from furrow to furrow, than in any park in England.\nBesides--\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said she, \"you want to get on to your dearly-loved upper\nThames, and show your prowess down the heavy swathes of the mowing\ngrass.\"\n\nShe looked at him fondly, and I could tell that she was seeing him in her\nmind's eye showing his splendid form at its best amidst the rhymed\nstrokes of the scythes; and she looked down at her own pretty feet with a\nhalf sigh, as though she were contrasting her slight woman's beauty with\nhis man's beauty; as women will when they are really in love, and are not\nspoiled with conventional sentiment.\n\nAs for Dick, he looked at her admiringly a while, and then said at last:\n\"Well, Clara, I do wish we were there!  But, hilloa! we are getting back\nway.\"  And he set to work sculling again, and in two minutes we were all\nstanding on the gravelly strand below the bridge, which, as you may\nimagine, was no longer the old hideous iron abortion, but a handsome\npiece of very solid oak framing.\n\nWe went into the Court and straight into the great hall, so well\nremembered, where there were tables spread for dinner, and everything\narranged much as in Hammersmith Guest-Hall.  Dinner over, we sauntered\nthrough the ancient rooms, where the pictures and tapestry were still\npreserved, and nothing was much changed, except that the people whom we\nmet there had an indefinable kind of look of being at home and at ease,\nwhich communicated itself to me, so that I felt that the beautiful old\nplace was mine in the best sense of the word; and my pleasure of past\ndays seemed to add itself to that of to-day, and filled my whole soul\nwith content.\n\nDick (who, in spite of Clara's gibe, knew the place very well) told me\nthat the beautiful old Tudor rooms, which I remembered had been the\ndwellings of the lesser fry of Court flunkies, were now much used by\npeople coming and going; for, beautiful as architecture had now become,\nand although the whole face of the country had quite recovered its\nbeauty, there was still a sort of tradition of pleasure and beauty which\nclung to that group of buildings, and people thought going to Hampton\nCourt a necessary summer outing, as they did in the days when London was\nso grimy and miserable.  We went into some of the rooms looking into the\nold garden, and were well received by the people in them, who got\nspeedily into talk with us, and looked with politely half-concealed\nwonder at my strange face.  Besides these birds of passage, and a few\nregular dwellers in the place, we saw out in the meadows near the garden,\ndown \"the Long Water,\" as it used to be called, many gay tents with men,\nwomen, and children round about them.  As it seemed, this pleasure-loving\npeople were fond of tent-life, with all its inconveniences, which,\nindeed, they turned into pleasure also.\n\nWe left this old friend by the time appointed, and I made some feeble\nshow of taking the sculls; but Dick repulsed me, not much to my grief, I\nmust say, as I found I had quite enough to do between the enjoyment of\nthe beautiful time and my own lazily blended thoughts.\n\nAs to Dick, it was quite right to let him pull, for he was as strong as a\nhorse, and had the greatest delight in bodily exercise, whatever it was.\nWe really had some difficulty in getting him to stop when it was getting\nrather more than dusk, and the moon was brightening just as we were off\nRunnymede.  We landed there, and were looking about for a place whereon\nto pitch our tents (for we had brought two with us), when an old man came\nup to us, bade us good evening, and asked if we were housed for that that\nnight; and finding that we were not, bade us home to his house.  Nothing\nloth, we went with him, and Clara took his hand in a coaxing way which I\nnoticed she used with old men; and as we went on our way, made some\ncommonplace remark about the beauty of the day.  The old man stopped\nshort, and looked at her and said: \"You really like it then?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, looking very much astonished, \"Don't you?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"perhaps I do.  I did, at any rate, when I was younger;\nbut now I think I should like it cooler.\"\n\nShe said nothing, and went on, the night growing about as dark as it\nwould be; till just at the rise of the hill we came to a hedge with a\ngate in it, which the old man unlatched and led us into a garden, at the\nend of which we could see a little house, one of whose little windows was\nalready yellow with candlelight.  We could see even under the doubtful\nlight of the moon and the last of the western glow that the garden was\nstuffed full of flowers; and the fragrance it gave out in the gathering\ncoolness was so wonderfully sweet, that it seemed the very heart of the\ndelight of the June dusk; so that we three stopped instinctively, and\nClara gave forth a little sweet \"O,\" like a bird beginning to sing.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said the old man, a little testily, and pulling at\nher hand.  \"There's no dog; or have you trodden on a thorn and hurt your\nfoot?\"\n\n\"No, no, neighbour,\" she said; \"but how sweet, how sweet it is!\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said he, \"but do you care so much for that?\"\n\nShe laughed out musically, and we followed suit in our gruffer voices;\nand then she said: \"Of course I do, neighbour; don't you?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" quoth the old fellow; then he added, as if somewhat\nashamed of himself: \"Besides, you know, when the waters are out and all\nRunnymede is flooded, it's none so pleasant.\"\n\n\"_I_ should like it,\" quoth Dick.  \"What a jolly sail one would get about\nhere on the floods on a bright frosty January morning!\"\n\n\"_Would_ you like it?\" said our host.  \"Well, I won't argue with you,\nneighbour; it isn't worth while.  Come in and have some supper.\"\n\nWe went up a paved path between the roses, and straight into a very\npretty room, panelled and carved, and as clean as a new pin; but the\nchief ornament of which was a young woman, light-haired and grey-eyed,\nbut with her face and hands and bare feet tanned quite brown with the\nsun.  Though she was very lightly clad, that was clearly from choice, not\nfrom poverty, though these were the first cottage-dwellers I had come\nacross; for her gown was of silk, and on her wrists were bracelets that\nseemed to me of great value.  She was lying on a sheep-skin near the\nwindow, but jumped up as soon as we entered, and when she saw the guests\nbehind the old man, she clapped her hands and cried out with pleasure,\nand when she got us into the middle of the room, fairly danced round us\nin delight of our company.\n\n\"What!\" said the old man, \"you are pleased, are you, Ellen?\"\n\nThe girl danced up to him and threw her arms round him, and said: \"Yes I\nam, and so ought you to be grandfather.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I am,\" said he, \"as much as I can be pleased.  Guests,\nplease be seated.\"\n\nThis seemed rather strange to us; stranger, I suspect, to my friends than\nto me; but Dick took the opportunity of both the host and his\ngrand-daughter being out of the room to say to me, softly: \"A grumbler:\nthere are a few of them still.  Once upon a time, I am told, they were\nquite a nuisance.\"\n\nThe old man came in as he spoke and sat down beside us with a sigh,\nwhich, indeed, seemed fetched up as if he wanted us to take notice of it;\nbut just then the girl came in with the victuals, and the carle missed\nhis mark, what between our hunger generally and that I was pretty busy\nwatching the grand-daughter moving about as beautiful as a picture.\n\nEverything to eat and drink, though it was somewhat different to what we\nhad had in London, was better than good, but the old man eyed rather\nsulkily the chief dish on the table, on which lay a leash of fine perch,\nand said:\n\n\"H'm, perch!  I am sorry we can't do better for you, guests.  The time\nwas when we might have had a good piece of salmon up from London for you;\nbut the times have grown mean and petty.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you might have had it now,\" said the girl, giggling, \"if you\nhad known that they were coming.\"\n\n\"It's our fault for not bringing it with us, neighbours,\" said Dick, good-\nhumouredly.  \"But if the times have grown petty, at any rate the perch\nhaven't; that fellow in the middle there must have weighed a good two\npounds when he was showing his dark stripes and red fins to the minnows\nyonder.  And as to the salmon, why, neighbour, my friend here, who comes\nfrom the outlands, was quite surprised yesterday morning when I told him\nwe had plenty of salmon at Hammersmith.  I am sure I have heard nothing\nof the times worsening.\"\n\nHe looked a little uncomfortable.  And the old man, turning to me, said\nvery courteously:\n\n\"Well, sir, I am happy to see a man from over the water; but I really\nmust appeal to you to say whether on the whole you are not better off in\nyour country; where I suppose, from what our guest says, you are brisker\nand more alive, because you have not wholly got rid of competition.  You\nsee, I have read not a few books of the past days, and certainly _they_\nare much more alive than those which are written now; and good sound\nunlimited competition was the condition under which they were written,--if\nwe didn't know that from the record of history, we should know it from\nthe books themselves.  There is a spirit of adventure in them, and signs\nof a capacity to extract good out of evil which our literature quite\nlacks now; and I cannot help thinking that our moralists and historians\nexaggerate hugely the unhappiness of the past days, in which such\nsplendid works of imagination and intellect were produced.\"\n\nClara listened to him with restless eyes, as if she were excited and\npleased; Dick knitted his brow and looked still more uncomfortable, but\nsaid nothing.  Indeed, the old man gradually, as he warmed to his\nsubject, dropped his sneering manner, and both spoke and looked very\nseriously.  But the girl broke out before I could deliver myself of the\nanswer I was framing:\n\n\"Books, books! always books, grandfather!  When will you understand that\nafter all it is the world we live in which interests us; the world of\nwhich we are a part, and which we can never love too much?  Look!\" she\nsaid, throwing open the casement wider and showing us the white light\nsparkling between the black shadows of the moonlit garden, through which\nran a little shiver of the summer night-wind, \"look! these are our books\nin these days!--and these,\" she said, stepping lightly up to the two\nlovers and laying a hand on each of their shoulders; \"and the guest\nthere, with his over-sea knowledge and experience;--yes, and even you,\ngrandfather\" (a smile ran over her face as she spoke), \"with all your\ngrumbling and wishing yourself back again in the good old days,--in\nwhich, as far as I can make out, a harmless and lazy old man like you\nwould either have pretty nearly starved, or have had to pay soldiers and\npeople to take the folk's victuals and clothes and houses away from them\nby force.  Yes, these are our books; and if we want more, can we not find\nwork to do in the beautiful buildings that we raise up all over the\ncountry (and I know there was nothing like them in past times), wherein a\nman can put forth whatever is in him, and make his hands set forth his\nmind and his soul.\"\n\nShe paused a little, and I for my part could not help staring at her, and\nthinking that if she were a book, the pictures in it were most lovely.\nThe colour mantled in her delicate sunburnt cheeks; her grey eyes, light\namidst the tan of her face, kindly looked on us all as she spoke.  She\npaused, and said again:\n\n\"As for your books, they were well enough for times when intelligent\npeople had but little else in which they could take pleasure, and when\nthey must needs supplement the sordid miseries of their own lives with\nimaginations of the lives of other people.  But I say flatly that in\nspite of all their cleverness and vigour, and capacity for story-telling,\nthere is something loathsome about them.  Some of them, indeed, do here\nand there show some feeling for those whom the history-books call 'poor,'\nand of the misery of whose lives we have some inkling; but presently they\ngive it up, and towards the end of the story we must be contented to see\nthe hero and heroine living happily in an island of bliss on other\npeople's troubles; and that after a long series of sham troubles (or\nmostly sham) of their own making, illustrated by dreary introspective\nnonsense about their feelings and aspirations, and all the rest of it;\nwhile the world must even then have gone on its way, and dug and sewed\nand baked and built and carpentered round about these useless--animals.\"\n\n\"There!\" said the old man, reverting to his dry sulky manner again.\n\"There's eloquence!  I suppose you like it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, very emphatically.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"now the storm of eloquence has lulled for a little,\nsuppose you answer my question?--that is, if you like, you know,\" quoth\nhe, with a sudden access of courtesy.\n\n\"What question?\" said I.  For I must confess that Ellen's strange and\nalmost wild beauty had put it out of my head.\n\nSaid he: \"First of all (excuse my catechising), is there competition in\nlife, after the old kind, in the country whence you come?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"it is the rule there.\"  And I wondered as I spoke what\nfresh complications I should get into as a result of this answer.\n\n\"Question two,\" said the carle: \"Are you not on the whole much freer,\nmore energetic--in a word, healthier and happier--for it?\"\n\nI smiled.  \"You wouldn't talk so if you had any idea of our life.  To me\nyou seem here as if you were living in heaven compared with us of the\ncountry from which I came.\"\n\n\"Heaven?\" said he: \"you like heaven, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I--snappishly, I am afraid; for I was beginning rather to\nresent his formula.\n\n\"Well, I am far from sure that I do,\" quoth he.  \"I think one may do more\nwith one's life than sitting on a damp cloud and singing hymns.\"\n\nI was rather nettled by this inconsequence, and said: \"Well, neighbour,\nto be short, and without using metaphors, in the land whence I come,\nwhere the competition which produced those literary works which you\nadmire so much is still the rule, most people are thoroughly unhappy;\nhere, to me at least most people seem thoroughly happy.\"\n\n\"No offence, guest--no offence,\" said he; \"but let me ask you; you like\nthat, do you?\"\n\nHis formula, put with such obstinate persistence, made us all laugh\nheartily; and even the old man joined in the laughter on the sly.\nHowever, he was by no means beaten, and said presently:\n\n\"From all I can hear, I should judge that a young woman so beautiful as\nmy dear Ellen yonder would have been a lady, as they called it in the old\ntime, and wouldn't have had to wear a few rags of silk as she does now,\nor to have browned herself in the sun as she has to do now.  What do you\nsay to that, eh?\"\n\nHere Clara, who had been pretty much silent hitherto, struck in, and\nsaid: \"Well, really, I don't think that you would have mended matters, or\nthat they want mending.  Don't you see that she is dressed deliciously\nfor this beautiful weather?  And as for the sun-burning of your\nhay-fields, why, I hope to pick up some of that for myself when we get a\nlittle higher up the river.  Look if I don't need a little sun on my\npasty white skin!\"\n\nAnd she stripped up the sleeve from her arm and laid it beside Ellen's\nwho was now sitting next her.  To say the truth, it was rather amusing to\nme to see Clara putting herself forward as a town-bred fine lady, for she\nwas as well-knit and clean-skinned a girl as might be met with anywhere\nat the best.  Dick stroked the beautiful arm rather shyly, and pulled\ndown the sleeve again, while she blushed at his touch; and the old man\nsaid laughingly: \"Well, I suppose you _do_ like that; don't you?\"\n\nEllen kissed her new friend, and we all sat silent for a little, till she\nbroke out into a sweet shrill song, and held us all entranced with the\nwonder of her clear voice; and the old grumbler sat looking at her\nlovingly.  The other young people sang also in due time; and then Ellen\nshowed us to our beds in small cottage chambers, fragrant and clean as\nthe ideal of the old pastoral poets; and the pleasure of the evening\nquite extinguished my fear of the last night, that I should wake up in\nthe old miserable world of worn-out pleasures, and hopes that were half\nfears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII: AN EARLY MORNING BY RUNNYMEDE\n\n\nThough there were no rough noises to wake me, I could not lie long abed\nthe next morning, where the world seemed so well awake, and, despite the\nold grumbler, so happy; so I got up, and found that, early as it was,\nsomeone had been stirring, since all was trim and in its place in the\nlittle parlour, and the table laid for the morning meal.  Nobody was\nafoot in the house as then, however, so I went out a-doors, and after a\nturn or two round the superabundant garden, I wandered down over the\nmeadow to the river-side, where lay our boat, looking quite familiar and\nfriendly to me.  I walked up stream a little, watching the light mist\ncurling up from the river till the sun gained power to draw it all away;\nsaw the bleak speckling the water under the willow boughs, whence the\ntiny flies they fed on were falling in myriads; heard the great chub\nsplashing here and there at some belated moth or other, and felt almost\nback again in my boyhood.  Then I went back again to the boat, and\nloitered there a minute or two, and then walked slowly up the meadow\ntowards the little house.  I noted now that there were four more houses\nof about the same size on the slope away from the river.  The meadow in\nwhich I was going was not up for hay; but a row of flake-hurdles ran up\nthe slope not far from me on each side, and in the field so parted off\nfrom ours on the left they were making hay busily by now, in the simple\nfashion of the days when I was a boy.  My feet turned that way\ninstinctively, as I wanted to see how haymakers looked in these new and\nbetter times, and also I rather expected to see Ellen there.  I came to\nthe hurdles and stood looking over into the hay-field, and was close to\nthe end of the long line of haymakers who were spreading the low ridges\nto dry off the night dew.  The majority of these were young women clad\nmuch like Ellen last night, though not mostly in silk, but in light\nwoollen mostly gaily embroidered; the men being all clad in white flannel\nembroidered in bright colours.  The meadow looked like a gigantic tulip-\nbed because of them.  All hands were working deliberately but well and\nsteadily, though they were as noisy with merry talk as a grove of autumn\nstarlings.  Half a dozen of them, men and women, came up to me and shook\nhands, gave me the sele of the morning, and asked a few questions as to\nwhence and whither, and wishing me good luck, went back to their work.\nEllen, to my disappointment, was not amongst them, but presently I saw a\nlight figure come out of the hay-field higher up the slope, and make for\nour house; and that was Ellen, holding a basket in her hand.  But before\nshe had come to the garden gate, out came Dick and Clara, who, after a\nminute's pause, came down to meet me, leaving Ellen in the garden; then\nwe three went down to the boat, talking mere morning prattle.  We stayed\nthere a little, Dick arranging some of the matters in her, for we had\nonly taken up to the house such things as we thought the dew might\ndamage; and then we went toward the house again; but when we came near\nthe garden, Dick stopped us by laying a hand on my arm and said,--\n\n\"Just look a moment.\"\n\nI looked, and over the low hedge saw Ellen, shading her eyes against the\nsun as she looked toward the hay-field, a light wind stirring in her\ntawny hair, her eyes like light jewels amidst her sunburnt face, which\nlooked as if the warmth of the sun were yet in it.\n\n\"Look, guest,\" said Dick; \"doesn't it all look like one of those very\nstories out of Grimm that we were talking about up in Bloomsbury?  Here\nare we two lovers wandering about the world, and we have come to a fairy\ngarden, and there is the very fairy herself amidst of it: I wonder what\nshe will do for us.\"\n\nSaid Clara demurely, but not stiffly: \"Is she a good fairy, Dick?\"\n\n\"O, yes,\" said he; \"and according to the card, she would do better, if it\nwere not for the gnome or wood-spirit, our grumbling friend of last\nnight.\"\n\nWe laughed at this; and I said, \"I hope you see that you have left me out\nof the tale.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"that's true.  You had better consider that you have got\nthe cap of darkness, and are seeing everything, yourself invisible.\"\n\nThat touched me on my weak side of not feeling sure of my position in\nthis beautiful new country; so in order not to make matters worse, I held\nmy tongue, and we all went into the garden and up to the house together.\nI noticed by the way that Clara must really rather have felt the contrast\nbetween herself as a town madam and this piece of the summer country that\nwe all admired so, for she had rather dressed after Ellen that morning as\nto thinness and scantiness, and went barefoot also, except for light\nsandals.\n\nThe old man greeted us kindly in the parlour, and said: \"Well, guests, so\nyou have been looking about to search into the nakedness of the land: I\nsuppose your illusions of last night have given way a bit before the\nmorning light?  Do you still like, it, eh?\"\n\n\"Very much,\" said I, doggedly; \"it is one of the prettiest places on the\nlower Thames.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" said he; \"so you know the Thames, do you?\"\n\nI reddened, for I saw Dick and Clara looking at me, and scarcely knew\nwhat to say.  However, since I had said in our early intercourse with my\nHammersmith friends that I had known Epping Forest, I thought a hasty\ngeneralisation might be better in avoiding complications than a downright\nlie; so I said--\n\n\"I have been in this country before; and I have been on the Thames in\nthose days.\"\n\n\"O,\" said the old man, eagerly, \"so you have been in this country before.\nNow really, don't you _find_ it (apart from all theory, you know) much\nchanged for the worse?\"\n\n\"No, not at all,\" said I; \"I find it much changed for the better.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" quoth he, \"I fear that you have been prejudiced by some theory or\nanother.  However, of course the time when you were here before must have\nbeen so near our own days that the deterioration might not be very great:\nas then we were, of course, still living under the same customs as we are\nnow.  I was thinking of earlier days than that.\"\n\n\"In short,\" said Clara, \"you have _theories_ about the change which has\ntaken place.\"\n\n\"I have facts as well,\" said he.  \"Look here! from this hill you can see\njust four little houses, including this one.  Well, I know for certain\nthat in old times, even in the summer, when the leaves were thickest, you\ncould see from the same place six quite big and fine houses; and higher\nup the water, garden joined garden right up to Windsor; and there were\nbig houses in all the gardens.  Ah!  England was an important place in\nthose days.\"\n\nI was getting nettled, and said: \"What you mean is that you\nde-cockneyised the place, and sent the damned flunkies packing, and that\neverybody can live comfortably and happily, and not a few damned thieves\nonly, who were centres of vulgarity and corruption wherever they were,\nand who, as to this lovely river, destroyed its beauty morally, and had\nalmost destroyed it physically, when they were thrown out of it.\"\n\nThere was silence after this outburst, which for the life of me I could\nnot help, remembering how I had suffered from cockneyism and its cause on\nthose same waters of old time.  But at last the old man said, quite\ncoolly:\n\n\"My dear guest, I really don't know what you mean by either cockneys, or\nflunkies, or thieves, or damned; or how only a few people could live\nhappily and comfortably in a wealthy country.  All I can see is that you\nare angry, and I fear with me: so if you like we will change the\nsubject.\"\n\nI thought this kind and hospitable in him, considering his obstinacy\nabout his theory; and hastened to say that I did not mean to be angry,\nonly emphatic.  He bowed gravely, and I thought the storm was over, when\nsuddenly Ellen broke in:\n\n\"Grandfather, our guest is reticent from courtesy; but really what he has\nin his mind to say to you ought to be said; so as I know pretty well what\nit is, I will say it for him: for as you know, I have been taught these\nthings by people who--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"by the sage of Bloomsbury, and others.\"\n\n\"O,\" said Dick, \"so you know my old kinsman Hammond?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"and other people too, as my grandfather says, and they\nhave taught me things: and this is the upshot of it.  We live in a little\nhouse now, not because we have nothing grander to do than working in the\nfields, but because we please; for if we liked, we could go and live in a\nbig house amongst pleasant companions.\"\n\nGrumbled the old man: \"Just so!  As if I would live amongst those\nconceited fellows; all of them looking down upon me!\"\n\nShe smiled on him kindly, but went on as if he had not spoken.  \"In the\npast times, when those big houses of which grandfather speaks were so\nplenty, we _must_ have lived in a cottage whether we had liked it or not;\nand the said cottage, instead of having in it everything we want, would\nhave been bare and empty.  We should not have got enough to eat; our\nclothes would have been ugly to look at, dirty and frowsy.  You,\ngrandfather, have done no hard work for years now, but wander about and\nread your books and have nothing to worry you; and as for me, I work hard\nwhen I like it, because I like it, and think it does me good, and knits\nup my muscles, and makes me prettier to look at, and healthier and\nhappier.  But in those past days you, grandfather, would have had to work\nhard after you were old; and would have been always afraid of having to\nbe shut up in a kind of prison along with other old men, half-starved and\nwithout amusement.  And as for me, I am twenty years old.  In those days\nmy middle age would be beginning now, and in a few years I should be\npinched, thin, and haggard, beset with troubles and miseries, so that no\none could have guessed that I was once a beautiful girl.\n\n\"Is this what you have had in your mind, guest?\" said she, the tears in\nher eyes at thought of the past miseries of people like herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, much moved; \"that and more.  Often--in my country I have\nseen that wretched change you have spoken of, from the fresh handsome\ncountry lass to the poor draggle-tailed country woman.\"\n\nThe old man sat silent for a little, but presently recovered himself and\ntook comfort in his old phrase of \"Well, you like it so, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ellen, \"I love life better than death.\"\n\n\"O, you do, do you?\" said he.  \"Well, for my part I like reading a good\nold book with plenty of fun in it, like Thackeray's 'Vanity Fair.'  Why\ndon't you write books like that now?  Ask that question of your\nBloomsbury sage.\"\n\nSeeing Dick's cheeks reddening a little at this sally, and noting that\nsilence followed, I thought I had better do something.  So I said: \"I am\nonly the guest, friends; but I know you want to show me your river at its\nbest, so don't you think we had better be moving presently, as it is\ncertainly going to be a hot day?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV: UP THE THAMES: THE SECOND DAY\n\n\nThey were not slow to take my hint; and indeed, as to the mere time of\nday, it was best for us to be off, as it was past seven o'clock, and the\nday promised to be very hot.  So we got up and went down to our\nboat--Ellen thoughtful and abstracted; the old man very kind and\ncourteous, as if to make up for his crabbedness of opinion.  Clara was\ncheerful and natural, but a little subdued, I thought; and she at least\nwas not sorry to be gone, and often looked shyly and timidly at Ellen and\nher strange wild beauty.  So we got into the boat, Dick saying as he took\nhis place, \"Well, it _is_ a fine day!\" and the old man answering \"What!\nyou like that, do you?\" once more; and presently Dick was sending the\nbows swiftly through the slow weed-checked stream.  I turned round as we\ngot into mid-stream, and waving my hand to our hosts, saw Ellen leaning\non the old man's shoulder, and caressing his healthy apple-red cheek, and\nquite a keen pang smote me as I thought how I should never see the\nbeautiful girl again.  Presently I insisted on taking the sculls, and I\nrowed a good deal that day; which no doubt accounts for the fact that we\ngot very late to the place which Dick had aimed at.  Clara was\nparticularly affectionate to Dick, as I noticed from the rowing thwart;\nbut as for him, he was as frankly kind and merry as ever; and I was glad\nto see it, as a man of his temperament could not have taken her caresses\ncheerfully and without embarrassment if he had been at all entangled by\nthe fairy of our last night's abode.\n\nI need say little about the lovely reaches of the river here.  I duly\nnoted that absence of cockney villas which the old man had lamented; and\nI saw with pleasure that my old enemies the \"Gothic\" cast-iron bridges\nhad been replaced by handsome oak and stone ones.  Also the banks of the\nforest that we passed through had lost their courtly game-keeperish\ntrimness, and were as wild and beautiful as need he, though the trees\nwere clearly well seen to.  I thought it best, in order to get the most\ndirect information, to play the innocent about Eton and Windsor; but Dick\nvolunteered his knowledge to me as we lay in Datchet lock about the\nfirst.  Quoth he:\n\n\"Up yonder are some beautiful old buildings, which were built for a great\ncollege or teaching-place by one of the mediaeval kings--Edward the\nSixth, I think\" (I smiled to myself at his rather natural blunder).  \"He\nmeant poor people's sons to be taught there what knowledge was going in\nhis days; but it was a matter of course that in the times of which you\nseem to know so much they spoilt whatever good there was in the founder's\nintentions.  My old kinsman says that they treated them in a very simple\nway, and instead of teaching poor men's sons to know something, they\ntaught rich men's sons to know nothing.  It seems from what he says that\nit was a place for the 'aristocracy' (if you know what that word means; I\nhave been told its meaning) to get rid of the company of their male\nchildren for a great part of the year.  I daresay old Hammond would give\nyou plenty of information in detail about it.\"\n\n\"What is it used for now?\" said I.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"the buildings were a good deal spoilt by the last few\ngenerations of aristocrats, who seem to have had a great hatred against\nbeautiful old buildings, and indeed all records of past history; but it\nis still a delightful place.  Of course, we cannot use it quite as the\nfounder intended, since our ideas about teaching young people are so\nchanged from the ideas of his time; so it is used now as a dwelling for\npeople engaged in learning; and folk from round about come and get taught\nthings that they want to learn; and there is a great library there of the\nbest books.  So that I don't think that the old dead king would be much\nhurt if he were to come to life and see what we are doing there.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Clara, laughing, \"I think he would miss the boys.\"\n\n\"Not always, my dear,\" said Dick, \"for there are often plenty of boys\nthere, who come to get taught; and also,\" said he, smiling, \"to learn\nboating and swimming.  I wish we could stop there: but perhaps we had\nbetter do that coming down the water.\"\n\nThe lock-gates opened as he spoke, and out we went, and on.  And as for\nWindsor, he said nothing till I lay on my oars (for I was sculling then)\nin Clewer reach, and looking up, said, \"What is all that building up\nthere?\"\n\nSaid he: \"There, I thought I would wait till you asked, yourself.  That\nis Windsor Castle: that also I thought I would keep for you till we come\ndown the water.  It looks fine from here, doesn't it?  But a great deal\nof it has been built or skinned in the time of the Degradation, and we\nwouldn't pull the buildings down, since they were there; just as with the\nbuildings of the Dung-Market.  You know, of course, that it was the\npalace of our old mediaeval kings, and was used later on for the same\npurpose by the parliamentary commercial sham-kings, as my old kinsman\ncalls them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I know all that.  What is it used for now?\"\n\n\"A great many people live there,\" said he, \"as, with all drawbacks, it is\na pleasant place; there is also a well-arranged store of antiquities of\nvarious kinds that have seemed worth keeping--a museum, it would have\nbeen called in the times you understand so well.\"\n\nI drew my sculls through the water at that last word, and pulled as if I\nwere fleeing from those times which I understood so well; and we were\nsoon going up the once sorely be-cockneyed reaches of the river about\nMaidenhead, which now looked as pleasant and enjoyable as the up-river\nreaches.\n\nThe morning was now getting on, the morning of a jewel of a summer day;\none of those days which, if they were commoner in these islands, would\nmake our climate the best of all climates, without dispute.  A light wind\nblew from the west; the little clouds that had arisen at about our\nbreakfast time had seemed to get higher and higher in the heavens; and in\nspite of the burning sun we no more longed for rain than we feared it.\nBurning as the sun was, there was a fresh feeling in the air that almost\nset us a-longing for the rest of the hot afternoon, and the stretch of\nblossoming wheat seen from the shadow of the boughs.  No one unburdened\nwith very heavy anxieties could have felt otherwise than happy that\nmorning: and it must be said that whatever anxieties might lie beneath\nthe surface of things, we didn't seem to come across any of them.\n\nWe passed by several fields where haymaking was going on, but Dick, and\nespecially Clara, were so jealous of our up-river festival that they\nwould not allow me to have much to say to them.  I could only notice that\nthe people in the fields looked strong and handsome, both men and women,\nand that so far from there being any appearance of sordidness about their\nattire, they seemed to be dressed specially for the occasion,--lightly,\nof course, but gaily and with plenty of adornment.\n\nBoth on this day as well as yesterday we had, as you may think, met and\npassed and been passed by many craft of one kind and another.  The most\npart of these were being rowed like ourselves, or were sailing, in the\nsort of way that sailing is managed on the upper reaches of the river;\nbut every now and then we came on barges, laden with hay or other country\nproduce, or carrying bricks, lime, timber, and the like, and these were\ngoing on their way without any means of propulsion visible to me--just a\nman at the tiller, with often a friend or two laughing and talking with\nhim.  Dick, seeing on one occasion this day, that I was looking rather\nhard on one of these, said: \"That is one of our force-barges; it is quite\nas easy to work vehicles by force by water as by land.\"\n\nI understood pretty well that these \"force vehicles\" had taken the place\nof our old steam-power carrying; but I took good care not to ask any\nquestions about them, as I knew well enough both that I should never be\nable to understand how they were worked, and that in attempting to do so\nI should betray myself, or get into some complication impossible to\nexplain; so I merely said, \"Yes, of course, I understand.\"\n\nWe went ashore at Bisham, where the remains of the old Abbey and the\nElizabethan house that had been added to them yet remained, none the\nworse for many years of careful and appreciative habitation.  The folk of\nthe place, however, were mostly in the fields that day, both men and\nwomen; so we met only two old men there, and a younger one who had stayed\nat home to get on with some literary work, which I imagine we\nconsiderably interrupted.  Yet I also think that the hard-working man who\nreceived us was not very sorry for the interruption.  Anyhow, he kept on\npressing us to stay over and over again, till at last we did not get away\ntill the cool of the evening.\n\nHowever, that mattered little to us; the nights were light, for the moon\nwas shining in her third quarter, and it was all one to Dick whether he\nsculled or sat quiet in the boat: so we went away a great pace.  The\nevening sun shone bright on the remains of the old buildings at\nMedmenham; close beside which arose an irregular pile of building which\nDick told us was a very pleasant house; and there were plenty of houses\nvisible on the wide meadows opposite, under the hill; for, as it seems\nthat the beauty of Hurley had compelled people to build and live there a\ngood deal.  The sun very low down showed us Henley little altered in\noutward aspect from what I remembered it.  Actual daylight failed us as\nwe passed through the lovely reaches of Wargrave and Shiplake; but the\nmoon rose behind us presently.  I should like to have seen with my eyes\nwhat success the new order of things had had in getting rid of the\nsprawling mess with which commercialism had littered the banks of the\nwide stream about Reading and Caversham: certainly everything smelt too\ndeliciously in the early night for there to be any of the old careless\nsordidness of so-called manufacture; and in answer to my question as to\nwhat sort of a place Reading was, Dick answered:\n\n\"O, a nice town enough in its way; mostly rebuilt within the last hundred\nyears; and there are a good many houses, as you can see by the lights\njust down under the hills yonder.  In fact, it is one of the most\npopulous places on the Thames round about here.  Keep up your spirits,\nguest! we are close to our journey's end for the night.  I ought to ask\nyour pardon for not stopping at one of the houses here or higher up; but\na friend, who is living in a very pleasant house in the Maple-Durham\nmeads, particularly wanted me and Clara to come and see him on our way up\nthe Thames; and I thought you wouldn't mind this bit of night\ntravelling.\"\n\nHe need not have adjured me to keep up my spirits, which were as high as\npossible; though the strangeness and excitement of the happy and quiet\nlife which I saw everywhere around me was, it is true, a little wearing\noff, yet a deep content, as different as possible from languid\nacquiescence, was taking its place, and I was, as it were, really new-\nborn.\n\nWe landed presently just where I remembered the river making an elbow to\nthe north towards the ancient house of the Blunts; with the wide meadows\nspreading on the right-hand side, and on the left the long line of\nbeautiful old trees overhanging the water.  As we got out of the boat, I\nsaid to Dick--\n\n\"Is it the old house we are going to?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"though that is standing still in green old age, and is\nwell inhabited.  I see, by the way, that you know your Thames well.  But\nmy friend Walter Allen, who asked me to stop here, lives in a house, not\nvery big, which has been built here lately, because these meadows are so\nmuch liked, especially in summer, that there was getting to be rather too\nmuch of tenting on the open field; so the parishes here about, who rather\nobjected to that, built three houses between this and Caversham, and\nquite a large one at Basildon, a little higher up.  Look, yonder are the\nlights of Walter Allen's house!\"\n\nSo we walked over the grass of the meadows under a flood of moonlight,\nand soon came to the house, which was low and built round a quadrangle\nbig enough to get plenty of sunshine in it.  Walter Allen, Dick's friend,\nwas leaning against the jamb of the doorway waiting for us, and took us\ninto the hall without overplus of words.  There were not many people in\nit, as some of the dwellers there were away at the haymaking in the\nneighbourhood, and some, as Walter told us, were wandering about the\nmeadow enjoying the beautiful moonlit night.  Dick's friend looked to be\na man of about forty; tall, black-haired, very kind-looking and\nthoughtful; but rather to my surprise there was a shade of melancholy on\nhis face, and he seemed a little abstracted and inattentive to our chat,\nin spite of obvious efforts to listen.\n\nDick looked on him from time to time, and seemed troubled; and at last he\nsaid: \"I say, old fellow, if there is anything the matter which we didn't\nknow of when you wrote to me, don't you think you had better tell us\nabout it at once?  Or else we shall think we have come here at an unlucky\ntime, and are not quite wanted.\"\n\nWalter turned red, and seemed to have some difficulty in restraining his\ntears, but said at last: \"Of course everybody here is very glad to see\nyou, Dick, and your friends; but it is true that we are not at our best,\nin spite of the fine weather and the glorious hay-crop.  We have had a\ndeath here.\"\n\nSaid Dick: \"Well, you should get over that, neighbour: such things must\nbe.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Walter said, \"but this was a death by violence, and it seems\nlikely to lead to at least one more; and somehow it makes us feel rather\nshy of one another; and to say the truth, that is one reason why there\nare so few of us present to-night.\"\n\n\"Tell us the story, Walter,\" said Dick; \"perhaps telling it will help you\nto shake off your sadness.\"\n\nSaid Walter: \"Well, I will; and I will make it short enough, though I\ndaresay it might be spun out into a long one, as used to be done with\nsuch subjects in the old novels.  There is a very charming girl here whom\nwe all like, and whom some of us do more than like; and she very\nnaturally liked one of us better than anybody else.  And another of us (I\nwon't name him) got fairly bitten with love-madness, and used to go about\nmaking himself as unpleasant as he could--not of malice prepense, of\ncourse; so that the girl, who liked him well enough at first, though she\ndidn't love him, began fairly to dislike him.  Of course, those of us who\nknew him best--myself amongst others--advised him to go away, as he was\nmaking matters worse and worse for himself every day.  Well, he wouldn't\ntake our advice (that also, I suppose, was a matter of course), so we had\nto tell him that he _must_ go, or the inevitable sending to Coventry\nwould follow; for his individual trouble had so overmastered him that we\nfelt that _we_ must go if he did not.\n\n\"He took that better than we expected, when something or other--an\ninterview with the girl, I think, and some hot words with the successful\nlover following close upon it, threw him quite off his balance; and he\ngot hold of an axe and fell upon his rival when there was no one by; and\nin the struggle that followed the man attacked, hit him an unlucky blow\nand killed him.  And now the slayer in his turn is so upset that he is\nlike to kill himself; and if he does, the girl will do as much, I fear.\nAnd all this we could no more help than the earthquake of the year before\nlast.\"\n\n\"It is very unhappy,\" said Dick; \"but since the man is dead, and cannot\nbe brought to life again, and since the slayer had no malice in him, I\ncannot for the life of me see why he shouldn't get over it before long.\nBesides, it was the right man that was killed and not the wrong.  Why\nshould a man brood over a mere accident for ever?  And the girl?\"\n\n\"As to her,\" said Walter, \"the whole thing seems to have inspired her\nwith terror rather than grief.  What you say about the man is true, or it\nshould be; but then, you see, the excitement and jealousy that was the\nprelude to this tragedy had made an evil and feverish element round about\nhim, from which he does not seem to be able to escape.  However, we have\nadvised him to go away--in fact, to cross the seas; but he is in such a\nstate that I do not think he _can_ go unless someone _takes_ him, and I\nthink it will fall to my lot to do so; which is scarcely a cheerful\noutlook for me.\"\n\n\"O, you will find a certain kind of interest in it,\" said Dick.  \"And of\ncourse he _must_ soon look upon the affair from a reasonable point of\nview sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate,\" quoth Walter, \"now that I have eased my mind by\nmaking you uncomfortable, let us have an end of the subject for the\npresent.  Are you going to take your guest to Oxford?\"\n\n\"Why, of course we must pass through it,\" said Dick, smiling, \"as we are\ngoing into the upper waters: but I thought that we wouldn't stop there,\nor we shall be belated as to the haymaking up our way.  So Oxford and my\nlearned lecture on it, all got at second-hand from my old kinsman, must\nwait till we come down the water a fortnight hence.\"\n\nI listened to this story with much surprise, and could not help wondering\nat first that the man who had slain the other had not been put in custody\ntill it could be proved that he killed his rival in self-defence only.\nHowever, the more I thought of it, the plainer it grew to me that no\namount of examination of witnesses, who had witnessed nothing but the ill-\nblood between the two rivals, would have done anything to clear up the\ncase.  I could not help thinking, also, that the remorse of this homicide\ngave point to what old Hammond had said to me about the way in which this\nstrange people dealt with what I had been used to hear called crimes.\nTruly, the remorse was exaggerated; but it was quite clear that the\nslayer took the whole consequences of the act upon himself, and did not\nexpect society to whitewash him by punishing him.  I had no fear any\nlonger that \"the sacredness of human life\" was likely to suffer amongst\nmy friends from the absence of gallows and prison.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV: THE THIRD DAY ON THE THAMES\n\n\nAs we went down to the boat next morning, Walter could not quite keep off\nthe subject of last night, though he was more hopeful than he had been\nthen, and seemed to think that if the unlucky homicide could not be got\nto go over-sea, he might at any rate go and live somewhere in the\nneighbourhood pretty much by himself; at any rate, that was what he\nhimself had proposed.  To Dick, and I must say to me also, this seemed a\nstrange remedy; and Dick said as much.  Quoth he:\n\n\"Friend Walter, don't set the man brooding on the tragedy by letting him\nlive alone.  That will only strengthen his idea that he has committed a\ncrime, and you will have him killing himself in good earnest.\"\n\nSaid Clara: \"I don't know.  If I may say what I think of it, it is that\nhe had better have his fill of gloom now, and, so to say, wake up\npresently to see how little need there has been for it; and then he will\nlive happily afterwards.  As for his killing himself, you need not be\nafraid of that; for, from all you tell me, he is really very much in love\nwith the woman; and to speak plainly, until his love is satisfied, he\nwill not only stick to life as tightly as he can, but will also make the\nmost of every event of his life--will, so to say, hug himself up in it;\nand I think that this is the real explanation of his taking the whole\nmatter with such an excess of tragedy.\"\n\nWalter looked thoughtful, and said: \"Well, you may be right; and perhaps\nwe should have treated it all more lightly: but you see, guest\" (turning\nto me), \"such things happen so seldom, that when they do happen, we\ncannot help being much taken up with it.  For the rest, we are all\ninclined, to excuse our poor friend for making us so unhappy, on the\nground that he does it out of an exaggerated respect for human life and\nits happiness.  Well, I will say no more about it; only this: will you\ngive me a cast up stream, as I want to look after a lonely habitation for\nthe poor fellow, since he will have it so, and I hear that there is one\nwhich would suit us very well on the downs beyond Streatley; so if you\nwill put me ashore there I will walk up the hill and look to it.\"\n\n\"Is the house in question empty?\" said I.\n\n\"No,\" said Walter, \"but the man who lives there will go out of it, of\ncourse, when he hears that we want it.  You see, we think that the fresh\nair of the downs and the very emptiness of the landscape will do our\nfriend good.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clara, smiling, \"and he will not be so far from his beloved\nthat they cannot easily meet if they have a mind to--as they certainly\nwill.\"\n\nThis talk had brought us down to the boat, and we were presently afloat\non the beautiful broad stream, Dick driving the prow swiftly through the\nwindless water of the early summer morning, for it was not yet six\no'clock.  We were at the lock in a very little time; and as we lay rising\nand rising on the in-coming water, I could not help wondering that my old\nfriend the pound-lock, and that of the very simplest and most rural kind,\nshould hold its place there; so I said:\n\n\"I have been wondering, as we passed lock after lock, that you people, so\nprosperous as you are, and especially since you are so anxious for\npleasant work to do, have not invented something which would get rid of\nthis clumsy business of going up-stairs by means of these rude\ncontrivances.\"\n\nDick laughed.  \"My dear friend,\" said he, \"as long as water has the\nclumsy habit of running down hill, I fear we must humour it by going up-\nstairs when we have our faces turned from the sea.  And really I don't\nsee why you should fall foul of Maple-Durham lock, which I think a very\npretty place.\"\n\nThere was no doubt about the latter assertion, I thought, as I looked up\nat the overhanging boughs of the great trees, with the sun coming\nglittering through the leaves, and listened to the song of the summer\nblackbirds as it mingled with the sound of the backwater near us.  So not\nbeing able to say why I wanted the locks away--which, indeed, I didn't do\nat all--I held my peace.  But Walter said--\n\n\"You see, guest, this is not an age of inventions.  The last epoch did\nall that for us, and we are now content to use such of its inventions as\nwe find handy, and leaving those alone which we don't want.  I believe,\nas a matter of fact, that some time ago (I can't give you a date) some\nelaborate machinery was used for the locks, though people did not go so\nfar as try to make the water run up hill.  However, it was troublesome, I\nsuppose, and the simple hatches, and the gates, with a big counterpoising\nbeam, were found to answer every purpose, and were easily mended when\nwanted with material always to hand: so here they are, as you see.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Dick, \"this kind of lock is pretty, as you can see; and I\ncan't help thinking that your machine-lock, winding up like a watch,\nwould have been ugly and would have spoiled the look of the river: and\nthat is surely reason enough for keeping such locks as these.  Good-bye,\nold fellow!\" said he to the lock, as he pushed us out through the now\nopen gates by a vigorous stroke of the boat-hook.  \"May you live long,\nand have your green old age renewed for ever!\"\n\nOn we went; and the water had the familiar aspect to me of the days\nbefore Pangbourne had been thoroughly cocknified, as I have seen it.  It\n(Pangbourne) was distinctly a village still--_i.e._, a definite group of\nhouses, and as pretty as might be.  The beech-woods still covered the\nhill that rose above Basildon; but the flat fields beneath them were much\nmore populous than I remembered them, as there were five large houses in\nsight, very carefully designed so as not to hurt the character of the\ncountry.  Down on the green lip of the river, just where the water turns\ntoward the Goring and Streatley reaches, were half a dozen girls playing\nabout on the grass.  They hailed us as we were about passing them, as\nthey noted that we were travellers, and we stopped a minute to talk with\nthem.  They had been bathing, and were light clad and bare-footed, and\nwere bound for the meadows on the Berkshire side, where the haymaking had\nbegun, and were passing the time merrily enough till the Berkshire folk\ncame in their punt to fetch them.  At first nothing would content them\nbut we must go with them into the hay-field, and breakfast with them; but\nDick put forward his theory of beginning the hay-harvest higher up the\nwater, and not spoiling my pleasure therein by giving me a taste of it\nelsewhere, and they gave way, though unwillingly.  In revenge they asked\nme a great many questions about the country I came from and the manners\nof life there, which I found rather puzzling to answer; and doubtless\nwhat answers I did give were puzzling enough to them.  I noticed both\nwith these pretty girls and with everybody else we met, that in default\nof serious news, such as we had heard at Maple-Durham, they were eager to\ndiscuss all the little details of life: the weather, the hay-crop, the\nlast new house, the plenty or lack of such and such birds, and so on; and\nthey talked of these things not in a fatuous and conventional way, but as\ntaking, I say, real interest in them.  Moreover, I found that the women\nknew as much about all these things as the men: could name a flower, and\nknew its qualities; could tell you the habitat of such and such birds and\nfish, and the like.\n\nIt is almost strange what a difference this intelligence made in my\nestimate of the country life of that day; for it used to be said in past\ntimes, and on the whole truly, that outside their daily work country\npeople knew little of the country, and at least could tell you nothing\nabout it; while here were these people as eager about all the goings on\nin the fields and woods and downs as if they had been Cockneys newly\nescaped from the tyranny of bricks and mortar.\n\nI may mention as a detail worth noticing that not only did there seem to\nbe a great many more birds about of the non-predatory kinds, but their\nenemies the birds of prey were also commoner.  A kite hung over our heads\nas we passed Medmenham yesterday; magpies were quite common in the\nhedgerows; I saw several sparrow-hawks, and I think a merlin; and now\njust as we were passing the pretty bridge which had taken the place of\nBasildon railway-bridge, a couple of ravens croaked above our boat, as\nthey sailed off to the higher ground of the downs.  I concluded from all\nthis that the days of the gamekeeper were over, and did not even need to\nask Dick a question about it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI: THE OBSTINATE REFUSERS\n\n\nBefore we parted from these girls we saw two sturdy young men and a woman\nputting off from the Berkshire shore, and then Dick bethought him of a\nlittle banter of the girls, and asked them how it was that there was\nnobody of the male kind to go with them across the water, and where their\nboats were gone to.  Said one, the youngest of the party: \"O, they have\ngot the big punt to lead stone from up the water.\"\n\n\"Who do you mean by 'they,' dear child?\" said Dick.\n\nSaid an older girl, laughing: \"You had better go and see them.  Look\nthere,\" and she pointed northwest, \"don't you see building going on\nthere?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, \"and I am rather surprised at this time of the year;\nwhy are they not haymaking with you?\"\n\nThe girls all laughed at this, and before their laugh was over, the\nBerkshire boat had run on to the grass and the girls stepped in lightly,\nstill sniggering, while the new comers gave us the sele of the day.  But\nbefore they were under way again, the tall girl said:\n\n\"Excuse us for laughing, dear neighbours, but we have had some friendly\nbickering with the builders up yonder, and as we have no time to tell you\nthe story, you had better go and ask them: they will be glad to see\nyou--if you don't hinder their work.\"\n\nThey all laughed again at that, and waved us a pretty farewell as the\npunters set them over toward the other shore, and left us standing on the\nbank beside our boat.\n\n\"Let us go and see them,\" said Clara; \"that is, if you are not in a hurry\nto get to Streatley, Walter?\"\n\n\"O no,\" said Walter, \"I shall be glad of the excuse to have a little more\nof your company.\"\n\nSo we left the boat moored there, and went on up the slow slope of the\nhill; but I said to Dick on the way, being somewhat mystified: \"What was\nall that laughing about? what was the joke!\"\n\n\"I can guess pretty well,\" said Dick; \"some of them up there have got a\npiece of work which interests them, and they won't go to the haymaking,\nwhich doesn't matter at all, because there are plenty of people to do\nsuch easy-hard work as that; only, since haymaking is a regular festival,\nthe neighbours find it amusing to jeer good-humouredly at them.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said I, \"much as if in Dickens's time some young people were so\nwrapped up in their work that they wouldn't keep Christmas.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Dick, \"only these people need not be young either.\"\n\n\"But what did you mean by easy-hard work?\" said I.\n\nQuoth Dick: \"Did I say that?  I mean work that tries the muscles and\nhardens them and sends you pleasantly weary to bed, but which isn't\ntrying in other ways: doesn't harass you in short.  Such work is always\npleasant if you don't overdo it.  Only, mind you, good mowing requires\nsome little skill.  I'm a pretty good mower.\"\n\nThis talk brought us up to the house that was a-building, not a large\none, which stood at the end of a beautiful orchard surrounded by an old\nstone wall.  \"O yes, I see,\" said Dick; \"I remember, a beautiful place\nfor a house: but a starveling of a nineteenth century house stood there:\nI am glad they are rebuilding: it's all stone, too, though it need not\nhave been in this part of the country: my word, though, they are making a\nneat job of it: but I wouldn't have made it all ashlar.\"\n\nWalter and Clara were already talking to a tall man clad in his mason's\nblouse, who looked about forty, but was I daresay older, who had his\nmallet and chisel in hand; there were at work in the shed and on the\nscaffold about half a dozen men and two women, blouse-clad like the\ncarles, while a very pretty woman who was not in the work but was dressed\nin an elegant suit of blue linen came sauntering up to us with her\nknitting in her hand.  She welcomed us and said, smiling: \"So you are\ncome up from the water to see the Obstinate Refusers: where are you going\nhaymaking, neighbours?\"\n\n\"O, right up above Oxford,\" said Dick; \"it is rather a late country.  But\nwhat share have you got with the Refusers, pretty neighbour?\"\n\nSaid she, with a laugh: \"O, I am the lucky one who doesn't want to work;\nthough sometimes I get it, for I serve as model to Mistress Philippa\nthere when she wants one: she is our head carver; come and see her.\"\n\nShe led us up to the door of the unfinished house, where a rather little\nwoman was working with mallet and chisel on the wall near by.  She seemed\nvery intent on what she was doing, and did not turn round when we came\nup; but a taller woman, quite a girl she seemed, who was at work near by,\nhad already knocked off, and was standing looking from Clara to Dick with\ndelighted eyes.  None of the others paid much heed to us.\n\nThe blue-clad girl laid her hand on the carver's shoulder and said: \"Now\nPhilippa, if you gobble up your work like that, you will soon have none\nto do; and what will become of you then?\"\n\nThe carver turned round hurriedly and showed us the face of a woman of\nforty (or so she seemed), and said rather pettishly, but in a sweet\nvoice:\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, Kate, and don't interrupt me if you can help it.\"\nShe stopped short when she saw us, then went on with the kind smile of\nwelcome which never failed us.  \"Thank you for coming to see us,\nneighbours; but I am sure that you won't think me unkind if I go on with\nmy work, especially when I tell you that I was ill and unable to do\nanything all through April and May; and this open-air and the sun and the\nwork together, and my feeling well again too, make a mere delight of\nevery hour to me; and excuse me, I must go on.\"\n\nShe fell to work accordingly on a carving in low relief of flowers and\nfigures, but talked on amidst her mallet strokes: \"You see, we all think\nthis the prettiest place for a house up and down these reaches; and the\nsite has been so long encumbered with an unworthy one, that we masons\nwere determined to pay off fate and destiny for once, and build the\nprettiest house we could compass here--and so--and so--\"\n\nHere she lapsed into mere carving, but the tall foreman came up and said:\n\"Yes, neighbours, that is it: so it is going to be all ashlar because we\nwant to carve a kind of a wreath of flowers and figures all round it; and\nwe have been much hindered by one thing or other--Philippa's illness\namongst others,--and though we could have managed our wreath without\nher--\"\n\n\"Could you, though?\" grumbled the last-named from the face of the wall.\n\n\"Well, at any rate, she is our best carver, and it would not have been\nkind to begin the carving without her.  So you see,\" said he, looking at\nDick and me, \"we really couldn't go haymaking, could we, neighbours?  But\nyou see, we are getting on so fast now with this splendid weather, that I\nthink we may well spare a week or ten days at wheat-harvest; and won't we\ngo at that work then!  Come down then to the acres that lie north and by\nwest here at our backs and you shall see good harvesters, neighbours.\n\n\"Hurrah, for a good brag!\" called a voice from the scaffold above us;\n\"our foreman thinks that an easier job than putting one stone on\nanother!\"\n\nThere was a general laugh at this sally, in which the tall foreman\njoined; and with that we saw a lad bringing out a little table into the\nshadow of the stone-shed, which he set down there, and then going back,\ncame out again with the inevitable big wickered flask and tall glasses,\nwhereon the foreman led us up to due seats on blocks of stone, and said:\n\n\"Well, neighbours, drink to my brag coming true, or I shall think you\ndon't believe me!  Up there!\" said he, hailing the scaffold, \"are you\ncoming down for a glass?\"  Three of the workmen came running down the\nladder as men with good \"building legs\" will do; but the others didn't\nanswer, except the joker (if he must so be called), who called out\nwithout turning round: \"Excuse me, neighbours for not getting down.  I\nmust get on: my work is not superintending, like the gaffer's yonder;\nbut, you fellows, send us up a glass to drink the haymakers' health.\"  Of\ncourse, Philippa would not turn away from her beloved work; but the other\nwoman carver came; she turned out to be Philippa's daughter, but was a\ntall strong girl, black-haired and gipsey-like of face and curiously\nsolemn of manner.  The rest gathered round us and clinked glasses, and\nthe men on the scaffold turned about and drank to our healths; but the\nbusy little woman by the door would have none of it all, but only\nshrugged her shoulders when her daughter came up to her and touched her.\n\nSo we shook hands and turned our backs on the Obstinate Refusers, went\ndown the slope to our boat, and before we had gone many steps heard the\nfull tune of tinkling trowels mingle with the humming of the bees and the\nsinging of the larks above the little plain of Basildon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII: THE UPPER WATERS\n\n\nWe set Walter ashore on the Berkshire side, amidst all the beauties of\nStreatley, and so went our ways into what once would have been the deeper\ncountry under the foot-hills of the White Horse; and though the contrast\nbetween half-cocknified and wholly unsophisticated country existed no\nlonger, a feeling of exultation rose within me (as it used to do) at\nsight of the familiar and still unchanged hills of the Berkshire range.\n\nWe stopped at Wallingford for our mid-day meal; of course, all signs of\nsqualor and poverty had disappeared from the streets of the ancient town,\nand many ugly houses had been taken down and many pretty new ones built,\nbut I thought it curious, that the town still looked like the old place I\nremembered so well; for indeed it looked like that ought to have looked.\n\nAt dinner we fell in with an old, but very bright and intelligent man,\nwho seemed in a country way to be another edition of old Hammond.  He had\nan extraordinary detailed knowledge of the ancient history of the country-\nside from the time of Alfred to the days of the Parliamentary Wars, many\nevents of which, as you may know, were enacted round about Wallingford.\nBut, what was more interesting to us, he had detailed record of the\nperiod of the change to the present state of things, and told us a great\ndeal about it, and especially of that exodus of the people from the town\nto the country, and the gradual recovery by the town-bred people on one\nside, and the country-bred people on the other, of those arts of life\nwhich they had each lost; which loss, as he told us, had at one time gone\nso far that not only was it impossible to find a carpenter or a smith in\na village or small country town, but that people in such places had even\nforgotten how to bake bread, and that at Wallingford, for instance, the\nbread came down with the newspapers by an early train from London, worked\nin some way, the explanation of which I could not understand.  He told us\nalso that the townspeople who came into the country used to pick up the\nagricultural arts by carefully watching the way in which the machines\nworked, gathering an idea of handicraft from machinery; because at that\ntime almost everything in and about the fields was done by elaborate\nmachines used quite unintelligently by the labourers.  On the other hand,\nthe old men amongst the labourers managed to teach the younger ones\ngradually a little artizanship, such as the use of the saw and the plane,\nthe work of the smithy, and so forth; for once more, by that time it was\nas much as--or rather, more than--a man could do to fix an ash pole to a\nrake by handiwork; so that it would take a machine worth a thousand\npounds, a group of workmen, and half a day's travelling, to do five\nshillings' worth of work.  He showed us, among other things, an account\nof a certain village council who were working hard at all this business;\nand the record of their intense earnestness in getting to the bottom of\nsome matter which in time past would have been thought quite trivial, as,\nfor example, the due proportions of alkali and oil for soap-making for\nthe village wash, or the exact heat of the water into which a leg of\nmutton should be plunged for boiling--all this joined to the utter\nabsence of anything like party feeling, which even in a village assembly\nwould certainly have made its appearance in an earlier epoch, was very\namusing, and at the same time instructive.\n\nThis old man, whose name was Henry Morsom, took us, after our meal and a\nrest, into a biggish hall which contained a large collection of articles\nof manufacture and art from the last days of the machine period to that\nday; and he went over them with us, and explained them with great care.\nThey also were very interesting, showing the transition from the\nmakeshift work of the machines (which was at about its worst a little\nafter the Civil War before told of) into the first years of the new\nhandicraft period.  Of course, there was much overlapping of the periods:\nand at first the new handwork came in very slowly.\n\n\"You must remember,\" said the old antiquary, \"that the handicraft was not\nthe result of what used to be called material necessity: on the contrary,\nby that time the machines had been so much improved that almost all\nnecessary work might have been done by them: and indeed many people at\nthat time, and before it, used to think that machinery would entirely\nsupersede handicraft; which certainly, on the face of it, seemed more\nthan likely.  But there was another opinion, far less logical, prevalent\namongst the rich people before the days of freedom, which did not die out\nat once after that epoch had begun.  This opinion, which from all I can\nlearn seemed as natural then, as it seems absurd now, was, that while the\nordinary daily work of the world would be done entirely by automatic\nmachinery, the energies of the more intelligent part of mankind would be\nset free to follow the higher forms of the arts, as well as science and\nthe study of history.  It was strange, was it not, that they should thus\nignore that aspiration after complete equality which we now recognise as\nthe bond of all happy human society?\"\n\nI did not answer, but thought the more.  Dick looked thoughtful, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Strange, neighbour?  Well, I don't know.  I have often heard my old\nkinsman say the one aim of all people before our time was to avoid work,\nor at least they thought it was; so of course the work which their daily\nlife forced them to do, seemed more like work than that which they seemed\nto choose for themselves.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" said Morsom.  \"Anyhow, they soon began to find out their\nmistake, and that only slaves and slave-holders could live solely by\nsetting machines going.\"\n\nClara broke in here, flushing a little as she spoke: \"Was not their\nmistake once more bred of the life of slavery that they had been\nliving?--a life which was always looking upon everything, except mankind,\nanimate and inanimate--'nature,' as people used to call it--as one thing,\nand mankind as another, it was natural to people thinking in this way,\nthat they should try to make 'nature' their slave, since they thought\n'nature' was something outside them.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said Morsom; \"and they were puzzled as to what to do, till they\nfound the feeling against a mechanical life, which had begun before the\nGreat Change amongst people who had leisure to think of such things, was\nspreading insensibly; till at last under the guise of pleasure that was\nnot supposed to be work, work that was pleasure began to push out the\nmechanical toil, which they had once hoped at the best to reduce to\nnarrow limits indeed, but never to get rid of; and which, moreover, they\nfound they could not limit as they had hoped to do.\"\n\n\"When did this new revolution gather head?\" said I.\n\n\"In the half-century that followed the Great Change,\" said Morsom, \"it\nbegan to be noteworthy; machine after machine was quietly dropped under\nthe excuse that the machines could not produce works of art, and that\nworks of art were more and more called for.  Look here,\" he said, \"here\nare some of the works of that time--rough and unskilful in handiwork, but\nsolid and showing some sense of pleasure in the making.\"\n\n\"They are very curious,\" said I, taking up a piece of pottery from\namongst the specimens which the antiquary was showing us; \"not a bit like\nthe work of either savages or barbarians, and yet with what would once\nhave been called a hatred of civilisation impressed upon them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Morsom, \"you must not look for delicacy there: in that period\nyou could only have got that from a man who was practically a slave.  But\nnow, you see,\" said he, leading me on a little, \"we have learned the\ntrick of handicraft, and have added the utmost refinement of workmanship\nto the freedom of fancy and imagination.\"\n\nI looked, and wondered indeed at the deftness and abundance of beauty of\nthe work of men who had at last learned to accept life itself as a\npleasure, and the satisfaction of the common needs of mankind and the\npreparation for them, as work fit for the best of the race.  I mused\nsilently; but at last I said--\n\n\"What is to come after this?\"\n\nThe old man laughed.  \"I don't know,\" said he; \"we will meet it when it\ncomes.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" quoth Dick, \"we have got to meet the rest of our day's\njourney; so out into the street and down to the strand!  Will you come a\nturn with us, neighbour?  Our friend is greedy of your stories.\"\n\n\"I will go as far as Oxford with you,\" said he; \"I want a book or two out\nof the Bodleian Library.  I suppose you will sleep in the old city?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dick, \"we are going higher up; the hay is waiting us there,\nyou know.\"\n\nMorsom nodded, and we all went into the street together, and got into the\nboat a little above the town bridge.  But just as Dick was getting the\nsculls into the rowlocks, the bows of another boat came thrusting through\nthe low arch.  Even at first sight it was a gay little craft\nindeed--bright green, and painted over with elegantly drawn flowers.  As\nit cleared the arch, a figure as bright and gay-clad as the boat rose up\nin it; a slim girl dressed in light blue silk that fluttered in the\ndraughty wind of the bridge.  I thought I knew the figure, and sure\nenough, as she turned her head to us, and showed her beautiful face, I\nsaw with joy that it was none other than the fairy godmother from the\nabundant garden on Runnymede--Ellen, to wit.\n\nWe all stopped to receive her.  Dick rose in the boat and cried out a\ngenial good morrow; I tried to be as genial as Dick, but failed; Clara\nwaved a delicate hand to her; and Morsom nodded and looked on with\ninterest.  As to Ellen, the beautiful brown of her face was deepened by a\nflush, as she brought the gunwale of her boat alongside ours, and said:\n\n\"You see, neighbours, I had some doubt if you would all three come back\npast Runnymede, or if you did, whether you would stop there; and besides,\nI am not sure whether we--my father and I--shall not be away in a week or\ntwo, for he wants to see a brother of his in the north country, and I\nshould not like him to go without me.  So I thought I might never see you\nagain, and that seemed uncomfortable to me, and--and so I came after\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dick, \"I am sure we are all very glad of that; although you\nmay be sure that as for Clara and me, we should have made a point of\ncoming to see you, and of coming the second time, if we had found you\naway the first.  But, dear neighbour, there you are alone in the boat,\nand you have been sculling pretty hard I should think, and might find a\nlittle quiet sitting pleasant; so we had better part our company into\ntwo.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ellen, \"I thought you would do that, so I have brought a\nrudder for my boat: will you help me to ship it, please?\"\n\nAnd she went aft in her boat and pushed along our side till she had\nbrought the stern close to Dick's hand.  He knelt down in our boat and\nshe in hers, and the usual fumbling took place over hanging the rudder on\nits hooks; for, as you may imagine, no change had taken place in the\narrangement of such an unimportant matter as the rudder of a pleasure-\nboat.  As the two beautiful young faces bent over the rudder, they seemed\nto me to be very close together, and though it only lasted a moment, a\nsort of pang shot through me as I looked on.  Clara sat in her place and\ndid not look round, but presently she said, with just the least stiffness\nin her tone:\n\n\"How shall we divide?  Won't you go into Ellen's boat, Dick, since,\nwithout offence to our guest, you are the better sculler?\"\n\nDick stood up and laid his hand on her shoulder, and said: \"No, no; let\nGuest try what he can do--he ought to be getting into training now.\nBesides, we are in no hurry: we are not going far above Oxford; and even\nif we are benighted, we shall have the moon, which will give us nothing\nworse of a night than a greyer day.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said I, \"I may manage to do a little more with my sculling\nthan merely keeping the boat from drifting down stream.\"\n\nThey all laughed at this, as if it had a been very good joke; and I\nthought that Ellen's laugh, even amongst the others, was one of the\npleasantest sounds I had ever heard.\n\nTo be short, I got into the new-come boat, not a little elated, and\ntaking the sculls, set to work to show off a little.  For--must I say\nit?--I felt as if even that happy world were made the happier for my\nbeing so near this strange girl; although I must say that of all the\npersons I had seen in that world renewed, she was the most unfamiliar to\nme, the most unlike what I could have thought of.  Clara, for instance,\nbeautiful and bright as she was, was not unlike a _very_ pleasant and\nunaffected young lady; and the other girls also seemed nothing more than\nspecimens of very much improved types which I had known in other times.\nBut this girl was not only beautiful with a beauty quite different from\nthat of \"a young lady,\" but was in all ways so strangely interesting; so\nthat I kept wondering what she would say or do next to surprise and\nplease me.  Not, indeed, that there was anything startling in what she\nactually said or did; but it was all done in a new way, and always with\nthat indefinable interest and pleasure of life, which I had noticed more\nor less in everybody, but which in her was more marked and more charming\nthan in anyone else that I had seen.\n\nWe were soon under way and going at a fair pace through the beautiful\nreaches of the river, between Bensington and Dorchester.  It was now\nabout the middle of the afternoon, warm rather than hot, and quite\nwindless; the clouds high up and light, pearly white, and gleaming,\nsoftened the sun's burning, but did not hide the pale blue in most\nplaces, though they seemed to give it height and consistency; the sky, in\nshort, looked really like a vault, as poets have sometimes called it, and\nnot like mere limitless air, but a vault so vast and full of light that\nit did not in any way oppress the spirits.  It was the sort of afternoon\nthat Tennyson must have been thinking about, when he said of the Lotos-\nEaters' land that it was a land where it was always afternoon.\n\nEllen leaned back in the stern and seemed to enjoy herself thoroughly.  I\ncould see that she was really looking at things and let nothing escape\nher, and as I watched her, an uncomfortable feeling that she had been a\nlittle touched by love of the deft, ready, and handsome Dick, and that\nshe had been constrained to follow us because of it, faded out of my\nmind; since if it had been so, she surely could not have been so\nexcitedly pleased, even with the beautiful scenes we were passing\nthrough.  For some time she did not say much, but at last, as we had\npassed under Shillingford Bridge (new built, but somewhat on its old\nlines), she bade me hold the boat while she had a good look at the\nlandscape through the graceful arch.  Then she turned about to me and\nsaid:\n\n\"I do not know whether to be sorry or glad that this is the first time\nthat I have been in these reaches.  It is true that it is a great\npleasure to see all this for the first time; but if I had had a year or\ntwo of memory of it, how sweetly it would all have mingled with my life,\nwaking or dreaming!  I am so glad Dick has been pulling slowly, so as to\nlinger out the time here.  How do you feel about your first visit to\nthese waters?\"\n\nI do not suppose she meant a trap for me, but anyhow I fell into it, and\nsaid: \"My first visit!  It is not my first visit by many a time.  I know\nthese reaches well; indeed, I may say that I know every yard of the\nThames from Hammersmith to Cricklade.\"\n\nI saw the complications that might follow, as her eyes fixed mine with a\ncurious look in them, that I had seen before at Runnymede, when I had\nsaid something which made it difficult for others to understand my\npresent position amongst these people.  I reddened, and said, in order to\ncover my mistake: \"I wonder you have never been up so high as this, since\nyou live on the Thames, and moreover row so well that it would be no\ngreat labour to you.  Let alone,\" quoth I, insinuatingly, \"that anybody\nwould be glad to row you.\"\n\nShe laughed, clearly not at my compliment (as I am sure she need not have\ndone, since it was a very commonplace fact), but at something which was\nstirring in her mind; and she still looked at me kindly, but with the\nabove-said keen look in her eyes, and then she said:\n\n\"Well, perhaps it is strange, though I have a good deal to do at home,\nwhat with looking after my father, and dealing with two or three young\nmen who have taken a special liking to me, and all of whom I cannot\nplease at once.  But you, dear neighbour; it seems to me stranger that\nyou should know the upper river, than that I should not know it; for, as\nI understand, you have only been in England a few days.  But perhaps you\nmean that you have read about it in books, and seen pictures of\nit?--though that does not come to much, either.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said I.  \"Besides, I have not read any books about the Thames:\nit was one of the minor stupidities of our time that no one thought fit\nto write a decent book about what may fairly be called our only English\nriver.\"\n\nThe words were no sooner out of my mouth than I saw that I had made\nanother mistake; and I felt really annoyed with myself, as I did not want\nto go into a long explanation just then, or begin another series of\nOdyssean lies.  Somehow, Ellen seemed to see this, and she took no\nadvantage of my slip; her piercing look changed into one of mere frank\nkindness, and she said:\n\n\"Well, anyhow I am glad that I am travelling these waters with you, since\nyou know our river so well, and I know little of it past Pangbourne, for\nyou can tell me all I want to know about it.\"  She paused a minute, and\nthen said: \"Yet you must understand that the part I do know, I know as\nthoroughly as you do.  I should be sorry for you to think that I am\ncareless of a thing so beautiful and interesting as the Thames.\"\n\nShe said this quite earnestly, and with an air of affectionate appeal to\nme which pleased me very much; but I could see that she was only keeping\nher doubts about me for another time.\n\nPresently we came to Day's Lock, where Dick and his two sitters had\nwaited for us.  He would have me go ashore, as if to show me something\nwhich I had never seen before; and nothing loth I followed him, Ellen by\nmy side, to the well-remembered Dykes, and the long church beyond them,\nwhich was still used for various purposes by the good folk of Dorchester:\nwhere, by the way, the village guest-house still had the sign of the\nFleur-de-luce which it used to bear in the days when hospitality had to\nbe bought and sold.  This time, however, I made no sign of all this being\nfamiliar to me: though as we sat for a while on the mound of the Dykes\nlooking up at Sinodun and its clear-cut trench, and its sister _mamelon_\nof Whittenham, I felt somewhat uncomfortable under Ellen's serious\nattentive look, which almost drew from me the cry, \"How little anything\nis changed here!\"\n\nWe stopped again at Abingdon, which, like Wallingford, was in a way both\nold and new to me, since it had been lifted out of its nineteenth-century\ndegradation, and otherwise was as little altered as might be.\n\nSunset was in the sky as we skirted Oxford by Oseney; we stopped a minute\nor two hard by the ancient castle to put Henry Morsom ashore.  It was a\nmatter of course that so far as they could be seen from the river, I\nmissed none of the towers and spires of that once don-beridden city; but\nthe meadows all round, which, when I had last passed through them, were\ngetting daily more and more squalid, more and more impressed with the\nseal of the \"stir and intellectual life of the nineteenth century,\" were\nno longer intellectual, but had once again become as beautiful as they\nshould be, and the little hill of Hinksey, with two or three very pretty\nstone houses new-grown on it (I use the word advisedly; for they seemed\nto belong to it) looked down happily on the full streams and waving\ngrass, grey now, but for the sunset, with its fast-ripening seeds.\n\nThe railway having disappeared, and therewith the various level bridges\nover the streams of Thames, we were soon through Medley Lock and in the\nwide water that washes Port Meadow, with its numerous population of geese\nnowise diminished; and I thought with interest how its name and use had\nsurvived from the older imperfect communal period, through the time of\nthe confused struggle and tyranny of the rights of property, into the\npresent rest and happiness of complete Communism.\n\nI was taken ashore again at Godstow, to see the remains of the old\nnunnery, pretty nearly in the same condition as I had remembered them;\nand from the high bridge over the cut close by, I could see, even in the\ntwilight, how beautiful the little village with its grey stone houses had\nbecome; for we had now come into the stone-country, in which every house\nmust be either built, walls and roof, of grey stone or be a blot on the\nlandscape.\n\nWe still rowed on after this, Ellen taking the sculls in my boat; we\npassed a weir a little higher up, and about three miles beyond it came by\nmoonlight again to a little town, where we slept at a house thinly\ninhabited, as its folk were mostly tented in the hay-fields.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII: THE LITTLE RIVER\n\n\nWe started before six o'clock the next morning, as we were still twenty-\nfive miles from our resting place, and Dick wanted to be there before\ndusk.  The journey was pleasant, though to those who do not know the\nupper Thames, there is little to say about it.  Ellen and I were once\nmore together in her boat, though Dick, for fairness' sake, was for\nhaving me in his, and letting the two women scull the green toy.  Ellen,\nhowever, would not allow this, but claimed me as the interesting person\nof the company.  \"After having come so far,\" said she, \"I will not be put\noff with a companion who will be always thinking of somebody else than\nme: the guest is the only person who can amuse me properly.  I mean that\nreally,\" said she, turning to me, \"and have not said it merely as a\npretty saying.\"\n\nClara blushed and looked very happy at all this; for I think up to this\ntime she had been rather frightened of Ellen.  As for me I felt young\nagain, and strange hopes of my youth were mingling with the pleasure of\nthe present; almost destroying it, and quickening it into something like\npain.\n\nAs we passed through the short and winding reaches of the now quickly\nlessening stream, Ellen said: \"How pleasant this little river is to me,\nwho am used to a great wide wash of water; it almost seems as if we shall\nhave to stop at every reach-end.  I expect before I get home this evening\nI shall have realised what a little country England is, since we can so\nsoon get to the end of its biggest river.\"\n\n\"It is not big,\" said I, \"but it is pretty.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"and don't you find it difficult to imagine the times\nwhen this little pretty country was treated by its folk as if it had been\nan ugly characterless waste, with no delicate beauty to be guarded, with\nno heed taken of the ever fresh pleasure of the recurring seasons, and\nchangeful weather, and diverse quality of the soil, and so forth?  How\ncould people be so cruel to themselves?\"\n\n\"And to each other,\" said I.  Then a sudden resolution took hold of me,\nand I said: \"Dear neighbour, I may as well tell you at once that I find\nit easier to imagine all that ugly past than you do, because I myself\nhave been part of it.  I see both that you have divined something of this\nin me; and also I think you will believe me when I tell you of it, so\nthat I am going to hide nothing from you at all.\"\n\nShe was silent a little, and then she said: \"My friend, you have guessed\nright about me; and to tell you the truth I have followed you up from\nRunnymede in order that I might ask you many questions, and because I saw\nthat you were not one of us; and that interested and pleased me, and I\nwanted to make you as happy as you could be.  To say the truth, there was\na risk in it,\" said she, blushing--\"I mean as to Dick and Clara; for I\nmust tell you, since we are going to be such close friends, that even\namongst us, where there are so many beautiful women, I have often\ntroubled men's minds disastrously.  That is one reason why I was living\nalone with my father in the cottage at Runnymede.  But it did not answer\non that score; for of course people came there, as the place is not a\ndesert, and they seemed to find me all the more interesting for living\nalone like that, and fell to making stories of me to themselves--like I\nknow you did, my friend.  Well, let that pass.  This evening, or\nto-morrow morning, I shall make a proposal to you to do something which\nwould please me very much, and I think would not hurt you.\"\n\nI broke in eagerly, saying that I would do anything in the world for her;\nfor indeed, in spite of my years and the too obvious signs of them\n(though that feeling of renewed youth was not a mere passing sensation, I\nthink)--in spite of my years, I say, I felt altogether too happy in the\ncompany of this delightful girl, and was prepared to take her confidences\nfor more than they meant perhaps.\n\nShe laughed now, but looked very kindly on me.  \"Well,\" she said,\n\"meantime for the present we will let it be; for I must look at this new\ncountry that we are passing through.  See how the river has changed\ncharacter again: it is broad now, and the reaches are long and very slow-\nrunning.  And look, there is a ferry!\"\n\nI told her the name of it, as I slowed off to put the ferry-chain over\nour heads; and on we went passing by a bank clad with oak trees on our\nleft hand, till the stream narrowed again and deepened, and we rowed on\nbetween walls of tall reeds, whose population of reed sparrows and\nwarblers were delightfully restless, twittering and chuckling as the wash\nof the boats stirred the reeds from the water upwards in the still, hot\nmorning.\n\nShe smiled with pleasure, and her lazy enjoyment of the new scene seemed\nto bring out her beauty doubly as she leaned back amidst the cushions,\nthough she was far from languid; her idleness being the idleness of a\nperson, strong and well-knit both in body and mind, deliberately resting.\n\n\"Look!\" she said, springing up suddenly from her place without any\nobvious effort, and balancing herself with exquisite grace and ease;\n\"look at the beautiful old bridge ahead!\"\n\n\"I need scarcely look at that,\" said I, not turning my head away from her\nbeauty.  \"I know what it is; though\" (with a smile) \"we used not to call\nit the Old Bridge time agone.\"\n\nShe looked down upon me kindly, and said, \"How well we get on now you are\nno longer on your guard against me!\"\n\nAnd she stood looking thoughtfully at me still, till she had to sit down\nas we passed under the middle one of the row of little pointed arches of\nthe oldest bridge across the Thames.\n\n\"O the beautiful fields!\" she said; \"I had no idea of the charm of a very\nsmall river like this.  The smallness of the scale of everything, the\nshort reaches, and the speedy change of the banks, give one a feeling of\ngoing somewhere, of coming to something strange, a feeling of adventure\nwhich I have not felt in bigger waters.\"\n\nI looked up at her delightedly; for her voice, saying the very thing\nwhich I was thinking, was like a caress to me.  She caught my eye and her\ncheeks reddened under their tan, and she said simply:\n\n\"I must tell you, my friend, that when my father leaves the Thames this\nsummer he will take me away to a place near the Roman wall in Cumberland;\nso that this voyage of mine is farewell to the south; of course with my\ngoodwill in a way; and yet I am sorry for it.  I hadn't the heart to tell\nDick yesterday that we were as good as gone from the Thames-side; but\nsomehow to you I must needs tell it.\"\n\nShe stopped and seemed very thoughtful for awhile, and then said smiling:\n\n\"I must say that I don't like moving about from one home to another; one\ngets so pleasantly used to all the detail of the life about one; it fits\nso harmoniously and happily into one's own life, that beginning again,\neven in a small way, is a kind of pain.  But I daresay in the country\nwhich you come from, you would think this petty and unadventurous, and\nwould think the worse of me for it.\"\n\nShe smiled at me caressingly as she spoke, and I made haste to answer:\n\"O, no, indeed; again you echo my very thoughts.  But I hardly expected\nto hear you speak so.  I gathered from all I have heard that there was a\ngreat deal of changing of abode amongst you in this country.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"of course people are free to move about; but except\nfor pleasure-parties, especially in harvest and hay-time, like this of\nours, I don't think they do so much.  I admit that I also have other\nmoods than that of stay-at-home, as I hinted just now, and I should like\nto go with you all through the west country--thinking of nothing,\"\nconcluded she smiling.\n\n\"I should have plenty to think of,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX: A RESTING-PLACE ON THE UPPER THAMES\n\n\nPresently at a place where the river flowed round a headland of the\nmeadows, we stopped a while for rest and victuals, and settled ourselves\non a beautiful bank which almost reached the dignity of a hill-side: the\nwide meadows spread before us, and already the scythe was busy amidst the\nhay.  One change I noticed amidst the quiet beauty of the fields--to wit,\nthat they were planted with trees here and there, often fruit-trees, and\nthat there was none of the niggardly begrudging of space to a handsome\ntree which I remembered too well; and though the willows were often\npolled (or shrowded, as they call it in that country-side), this was done\nwith some regard to beauty: I mean that there was no polling of rows on\nrows so as to destroy the pleasantness of half a mile of country, but a\nthoughtful sequence in the cutting, that prevented a sudden bareness\nanywhere.  To be short, the fields were everywhere treated as a garden\nmade for the pleasure as well as the livelihood of all, as old Hammond\ntold me was the case.\n\nOn this bank or bent of the hill, then, we had our mid-day meal; somewhat\nearly for dinner, if that mattered, but we had been stirring early: the\nslender stream of the Thames winding below us between the garden of a\ncountry I have been telling of; a furlong from us was a beautiful little\nislet begrown with graceful trees; on the slopes westward of us was a\nwood of varied growth overhanging the narrow meadow on the south side of\nthe river; while to the north was a wide stretch of mead rising very\ngradually from the river's edge.  A delicate spire of an ancient building\nrose up from out of the trees in the middle distance, with a few grey\nhouses clustered about it; while nearer to us, in fact not half a furlong\nfrom the water, was a quite modern stone house--a wide quadrangle of one\nstory, the buildings that made it being quite low.  There was no garden\nbetween it and the river, nothing but a row of pear-trees still quite\nyoung and slender; and though there did not seem to be much ornament\nabout it, it had a sort of natural elegance, like that of the trees\nthemselves.\n\nAs we sat looking down on all this in the sweet June day, rather happy\nthan merry, Ellen, who sat next me, her hand clasped about one knee,\nleaned sideways to me, and said in a low voice which Dick and Clara might\nhave noted if they had not been busy in happy wordless love-making:\n\"Friend, in your country were the houses of your field-labourers anything\nlike that?\"\n\nI said: \"Well, at any rate the houses of our rich men were not; they were\nmere blots upon the face of the land.\"\n\n\"I find that hard to understand,\" she said.  \"I can see why the workmen,\nwho were so oppressed, should not have been able to live in beautiful\nhouses; for it takes time and leisure, and minds not over-burdened with\ncare, to make beautiful dwellings; and I quite understand that these poor\npeople were not allowed to live in such a way as to have these (to us)\nnecessary good things.  But why the rich men, who had the time and the\nleisure and the materials for building, as it would be in this case,\nshould not have housed themselves well, I do not understand as yet.  I\nknow what you are meaning to say to me,\" she said, looking me full in the\neyes and blushing, \"to wit that their houses and all belonging to them\nwere generally ugly and base, unless they chanced to be ancient like\nyonder remnant of our forefathers' work\" (pointing to the spire); \"that\nthey were--let me see; what is the word?\"\n\n\"Vulgar,\" said I.  \"We used to say,\" said I, \"that the ugliness and\nvulgarity of the rich men's dwellings was a necessary reflection from the\nsordidness and bareness of life which they forced upon the poor people.\"\n\nShe knit her brows as in thought; then turned a brightened face on me, as\nif she had caught the idea, and said: \"Yes, friend, I see what you mean.\nWe have sometimes--those of us who look into these things--talked this\nvery matter over; because, to say the truth, we have plenty of record of\nthe so-called arts of the time before Equality of Life; and there are not\nwanting people who say that the state of that society was not the cause\nof all that ugliness; that they were ugly in their life because they\nliked to be, and could have had beautiful things about them if they had\nchosen; just as a man or body of men now may, if they please, make things\nmore or less beautiful--Stop!  I know what you are going to say.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said I, smiling, yet with a beating heart.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said; \"you are answering me, teaching me, in some way or\nanother, although you have not spoken the words aloud.  You were going to\nsay that in times of inequality it was an essential condition of the life\nof these rich men that they should not themselves make what they wanted\nfor the adornment of their lives, but should force those to make them\nwhom they forced to live pinched and sordid lives; and that as a\nnecessary consequence the sordidness and pinching, the ugly barrenness of\nthose ruined lives, were worked up into the adornment of the lives of the\nrich, and art died out amongst men?  Was that what you would say, my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said, looking at her eagerly; for she had risen and was\nstanding on the edge of the bent, the light wind stirring her dainty\nraiment, one hand laid on her bosom, the other arm stretched downward and\nclenched in her earnestness.\n\n\"It is true,\" she said, \"it is true!  We have proved it true!\"\n\nI think amidst my--something more than interest in her, and admiration\nfor her, I was beginning to wonder how it would all end.  I had a\nglimmering of fear of what might follow; of anxiety as to the remedy\nwhich this new age might offer for the missing of something one might set\none's heart on.  But now Dick rose to his feet and cried out in his\nhearty manner: \"Neighbour Ellen, are you quarrelling with the guest, or\nare you worrying him to tell you things which he cannot properly explain\nto our ignorance?\"\n\n\"Neither, dear neighbour,\" she said.  \"I was so far from quarrelling with\nhim that I think I have been making him good friends both with himself\nand me.  Is it so, dear guest?\" she said, looking down at me with a\ndelightful smile of confidence in being understood.\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, moreover,\" she said, \"I must say for him that he has explained\nhimself to me very well indeed, so that I quite understand him.\"\n\n\"All right,\" quoth Dick.  \"When I first set eyes on you at Runnymede I\nknew that there was something wonderful in your keenness of wits.  I\ndon't say that as a mere pretty speech to please you,\" said he quickly,\n\"but because it is true; and it made me want to see more of you.  But,\ncome, we ought to be going; for we are not half way, and we ought to be\nin well before sunset.\"\n\nAnd therewith he took Clara's hand, and led her down the bent.  But Ellen\nstood thoughtfully looking down for a little, and as I took her hand to\nfollow Dick, she turned round to me and said:\n\n\"You might tell me a great deal and make many things clear to me, if you\nwould.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I am pretty well fit for that,--and for nothing else--an\nold man like me.\"\n\nShe did not notice the bitterness which, whether I liked it or not, was\nin my voice as I spoke, but went on: \"It is not so much for myself; I\nshould be quite content to dream about past times, and if I could not\nidealise them, yet at least idealise some of the people who lived in\nthem.  But I think sometimes people are too careless of the history of\nthe past--too apt to leave it in the hands of old learned men like\nHammond.  Who knows?  Happy as we are, times may alter; we may be bitten\nwith some impulse towards change, and many things may seem too wonderful\nfor us to resist, too exciting not to catch at, if we do not know that\nthey are but phases of what has been before; and withal ruinous,\ndeceitful, and sordid.\"\n\nAs we went slowly down toward the boats she said again: \"Not for myself\nalone, dear friend; I shall have children; perhaps before the end a good\nmany;--I hope so.  And though of course I cannot force any special kind\nof knowledge upon them, yet, my Friend, I cannot help thinking that just\nas they might be like me in body, so I might impress upon them some part\nof my ways of thinking; that is, indeed, some of the essential part of\nmyself; that part which was not mere moods, created by the matters and\nevents round about me.  What do you think?\"\n\nOf one thing I was sure, that her beauty and kindness and eagerness\ncombined, forced me to think as she did, when she was not earnestly\nlaying herself open to receive my thoughts.  I said, what at the time was\ntrue, that I thought it most important; and presently stood entranced by\nthe wonder of her grace as she stepped into the light boat, and held out\nher hand to me.  And so on we went up the Thames still--or whither?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX: THE JOURNEY'S END\n\n\nOn we went.  In spite of my new-born excitement about Ellen, and my\ngathering fear of where it would land me, I could not help taking\nabundant interest in the condition of the river and its banks; all the\nmore as she never seemed weary of the changing picture, but looked at\nevery yard of flowery bank and gurgling eddy with the same kind of\naffectionate interest which I myself once had so fully, as I used to\nthink, and perhaps had not altogether lost even in this strangely changed\nsociety with all its wonders.  Ellen seemed delighted with my pleasure at\nthis, that, or the other piece of carefulness in dealing with the river:\nthe nursing of pretty corners; the ingenuity in dealing with difficulties\nof water-engineering, so that the most obviously useful works looked\nbeautiful and natural also.  All this, I say, pleased me hugely, and she\nwas pleased at my pleasure--but rather puzzled too.\n\n\"You seem astonished,\" she said, just after we had passed a mill {2}\nwhich spanned all the stream save the water-way for traffic, but which\nwas as beautiful in its way as a Gothic cathedral--\"You seem astonished\nat this being so pleasant to look at.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"in a way I am; though I don't see why it should not be.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, looking at me admiringly, yet with a lurking smile in her\nface, \"you know all about the history of the past.  Were they not always\ncareful about this little stream which now adds so much pleasantness to\nthe country side?  It would always be easy to manage this little river.\nAh!  I forgot, though,\" she said, as her eye caught mine, \"in the days we\nare thinking of pleasure was wholly neglected in such matters.  But how\ndid they manage the river in the days that you--\"  Lived in she was going\nto say; but correcting herself, said--\"in the days of which you have\nrecord?\"\n\n\"They _mis_managed it,\" quoth I.  \"Up to the first half of the nineteenth\ncentury, when it was still more or less of a highway for the country\npeople, some care was taken of the river and its banks; and though I\ndon't suppose anyone troubled himself about its aspect, yet it was trim\nand beautiful.  But when the railways--of which no doubt you have\nheard--came into power, they would not allow the people of the country to\nuse either the natural or artificial waterways, of which latter there\nwere a great many.  I suppose when we get higher up we shall see one of\nthese; a very important one, which one of these railways entirely closed\nto the public, so that they might force people to send their goods by\ntheir private road, and so tax them as heavily as they could.\"\n\nEllen laughed heartily.  \"Well,\" she said, \"that is not stated clearly\nenough in our history-books, and it is worth knowing.  But certainly the\npeople of those days must have been a curiously lazy set.  We are not\neither fidgety or quarrelsome now, but if any one tried such a piece of\nfolly on us, we should use the said waterways, whoever gainsaid us:\nsurely that would be simple enough.  However, I remember other cases of\nthis stupidity: when I was on the Rhine two years ago, I remember they\nshowed us ruins of old castles, which, according to what we heard, must\nhave been made for pretty much the same purpose as the railways were.  But\nI am interrupting your history of the river: pray go on.\"\n\n\"It is both short and stupid enough,\" said I.  \"The river having lost its\npractical or commercial value--that is, being of no use to make money\nof--\"\n\nShe nodded.  \"I understand what that queer phrase means,\" said she.  \"Go\non!\"\n\n\"Well, it was utterly neglected, till at last it became a nuisance--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" quoth Ellen, \"I understand: like the railways and the robber\nknights.  Yes?\"\n\n\"So then they turned the makeshift business on to it, and handed it over\nto a body up in London, who from time to time, in order to show that they\nhad something to do, did some damage here and there,--cut down trees,\ndestroying the banks thereby; dredged the river (where it was not needed\nalways), and threw the dredgings on the fields so as to spoil them; and\nso forth.  But for the most part they practised 'masterly inactivity,' as\nit was then called--that is, they drew their salaries, and let things\nalone.\"\n\n\"Drew their salaries,\" she said.  \"I know that means that they were\nallowed to take an extra lot of other people's goods for doing nothing.\nAnd if that had been all, it really might have been worth while to let\nthem do so, if you couldn't find any other way of keeping them quiet; but\nit seems to me that being so paid, they could not help doing something,\nand that something was bound to be mischief,--because,\" said she,\nkindling with sudden anger, \"the whole business was founded on lies and\nfalse pretensions.  I don't mean only these river-guardians, but all\nthese master-people I have read of.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"how happy you are to have got out of the parsimony of\noppression!\"\n\n\"Why do you sigh?\" she said, kindly and somewhat anxiously.  \"You seem to\nthink that it will not last?\"\n\n\"It will last for you,\" quoth I.\n\n\"But why not for you?\" said she.  \"Surely it is for all the world; and if\nyour country is somewhat backward, it will come into line before long.\nOr,\" she said quickly, \"are you thinking that you must soon go back\nagain?  I will make my proposal which I told you of at once, and so\nperhaps put an end to your anxiety.  I was going to propose that you\nshould live with us where we are going.  I feel quite old friends with\nyou, and should be sorry to lose you.\"  Then she smiled on me, and said:\n\"Do you know, I begin to suspect you of wanting to nurse a sham sorrow,\nlike the ridiculous characters in some of those queer old novels that I\nhave come across now and then.\"\n\nI really had almost begun to suspect it myself, but I refused to admit so\nmuch; so I sighed no more, but fell to giving my delightful companion\nwhat little pieces of history I knew about the river and its borderlands;\nand the time passed pleasantly enough; and between the two of us (she was\na better sculler than I was, and seemed quite tireless) we kept up fairly\nwell with Dick, hot as the afternoon was, and swallowed up the way at a\ngreat rate.  At last we passed under another ancient bridge; and through\nmeadows bordered at first with huge elm-trees mingled with sweet chestnut\nof younger but very elegant growth; and the meadows widened out so much\nthat it seemed as if the trees must now be on the bents only, or about\nthe houses, except for the growth of willows on the immediate banks; so\nthat the wide stretch of grass was little broken here.  Dick got very\nmuch excited now, and often stood up in the boat to cry out to us that\nthis was such and such a field, and so forth; and we caught fire at his\nenthusiasm for the hay-field and its harvest, and pulled our best.\n\nAt last as we were passing through a reach of the river where on the side\nof the towing-path was a highish bank with a thick whispering bed of\nreeds before it, and on the other side a higher bank, clothed with\nwillows that dipped into the stream and crowned by ancient elm-trees, we\nsaw bright figures coming along close to the bank, as if they were\nlooking for something; as, indeed, they were, and we--that is, Dick and\nhis company--were what they were looking for.  Dick lay on his oars, and\nwe followed his example.  He gave a joyous shout to the people on the\nbank, which was echoed back from it in many voices, deep and sweetly\nshrill; for there were above a dozen persons, both men, women, and\nchildren.  A tall handsome woman, with black wavy hair and deep-set grey\neyes, came forward on the bank and waved her hand gracefully to us, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Dick, my friend, we have almost had to wait for you!  What excuse have\nyou to make for your slavish punctuality?  Why didn't you take us by\nsurprise, and come yesterday?\"\n\n\"O,\" said Dick, with an almost imperceptible jerk of his head toward our\nboat, \"we didn't want to come too quick up the water; there is so much to\nsee for those who have not been up here before.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" said the stately lady, for stately is the word that must be\nused for her; \"and we want them to get to know the wet way from the east\nthoroughly well, since they must often use it now.  But come ashore at\nonce, Dick, and you, dear neighbours; there is a break in the reeds and a\ngood landing-place just round the corner.  We can carry up your things,\nor send some of the lads after them.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Dick; \"it is easier going by water, though it is but a\nstep.  Besides, I want to bring my friend here to the proper place.  We\nwill go on to the Ford; and you can talk to us from the bank as we paddle\nalong.\"\n\nHe pulled his sculls through the water, and on we went, turning a sharp\nangle and going north a little.  Presently we saw before us a bank of elm-\ntrees, which told us of a house amidst them, though I looked in vain for\nthe grey walls that I expected to see there.  As we went, the folk on the\nbank talked indeed, mingling their kind voices with the cuckoo's song,\nthe sweet strong whistle of the blackbirds, and the ceaseless note of the\ncorn-crake as he crept through the long grass of the mowing-field; whence\ncame waves of fragrance from the flowering clover amidst of the ripe\ngrass.\n\nIn a few minutes we had passed through a deep eddying pool into the sharp\nstream that ran from the ford, and beached our craft on a tiny strand of\nlimestone-gravel, and stepped ashore into the arms of our up-river\nfriends, our journey done.\n\nI disentangled myself from the merry throng, and mounting on the cart-\nroad that ran along the river some feet above the water, I looked round\nabout me.  The river came down through a wide meadow on my left, which\nwas grey now with the ripened seeding grasses; the gleaming water was\nlost presently by a turn of the bank, but over the meadow I could see the\nmingled gables of a building where I knew the lock must be, and which now\nseemed to combine a mill with it.  A low wooded ridge bounded the river-\nplain to the south and south-east, whence we had come, and a few low\nhouses lay about its feet and up its slope.  I turned a little to my\nright, and through the hawthorn sprays and long shoots of the wild roses\ncould see the flat country spreading out far away under the sun of the\ncalm evening, till something that might be called hills with a look of\nsheep-pastures about them bounded it with a soft blue line.  Before me,\nthe elm-boughs still hid most of what houses there might be in this river-\nside dwelling of men; but to the right of the cart-road a few grey\nbuildings of the simplest kind showed here and there.\n\nThere I stood in a dreamy mood, and rubbed my eyes as if I were not\nwholly awake, and half expected to see the gay-clad company of beautiful\nmen and women change to two or three spindle-legged back-bowed men and\nhaggard, hollow-eyed, ill-favoured women, who once wore down the soil of\nthis land with their heavy hopeless feet, from day to day, and season to\nseason, and year to year.  But no change came as yet, and my heart\nswelled with joy as I thought of all the beautiful grey villages, from\nthe river to the plain and the plain to the uplands, which I could\npicture to myself so well, all peopled now with this happy and lovely\nfolk, who had cast away riches and attained to wealth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI: AN OLD HOUSE AMONGST NEW FOLK\n\n\nAs I stood there Ellen detached herself from our happy friends who still\nstood on the little strand and came up to me.  She took me by the hand,\nand said softly, \"Take me on to the house at once; we need not wait for\nthe others: I had rather not.\"\n\nI had a mind to say that I did not know the way thither, and that the\nriver-side dwellers should lead; but almost without my will my feet moved\non along the road they knew.  The raised way led us into a little field\nbounded by a backwater of the river on one side; on the right hand we\ncould see a cluster of small houses and barns, new and old, and before us\na grey stone barn and a wall partly overgrown with ivy, over which a few\ngrey gables showed.  The village road ended in the shallow of the\naforesaid backwater.  We crossed the road, and again almost without my\nwill my hand raised the latch of a door in the wall, and we stood\npresently on a stone path which led up to the old house to which fate in\nthe shape of Dick had so strangely brought me in this new world of men.\nMy companion gave a sigh of pleased surprise and enjoyment; nor did I\nwonder, for the garden between the wall and the house was redolent of the\nJune flowers, and the roses were rolling over one another with that\ndelicious superabundance of small well-tended gardens which at first\nsight takes away all thought from the beholder save that of beauty.  The\nblackbirds were singing their loudest, the doves were cooing on the roof-\nridge, the rooks in the high elm-trees beyond were garrulous among the\nyoung leaves, and the swifts wheeled whining about the gables.  And the\nhouse itself was a fit guardian for all the beauty of this heart of\nsummer.\n\nOnce again Ellen echoed my thoughts as she said:\n\n\"Yes, friend, this is what I came out for to see; this many-gabled old\nhouse built by the simple country-folk of the long-past times, regardless\nof all the turmoil that was going on in cities and courts, is lovely\nstill amidst all the beauty which these latter days have created; and I\ndo not wonder at our friends tending it carefully and making much of it.\nIt seems to me as if it had waited for these happy days, and held in it\nthe gathered crumbs of happiness of the confused and turbulent past.\"\n\nShe led me up close to the house, and laid her shapely sun-browned hand\nand arm on the lichened wall as if to embrace it, and cried out, \"O me!  O\nme!  How I love the earth, and the seasons, and weather, and all things\nthat deal with it, and all that grows out of it,--as this has done!\"\n\nI could not answer her, or say a word.  Her exultation and pleasure were\nso keen and exquisite, and her beauty, so delicate, yet so interfused\nwith energy, expressed it so fully, that any added word would have been\ncommonplace and futile.  I dreaded lest the others should come in\nsuddenly and break the spell she had cast about me; but we stood there a\nwhile by the corner of the big gable of the house, and no one came.  I\nheard the merry voices some way off presently, and knew that they were\ngoing along the river to the great meadow on the other side of the house\nand garden.\n\nWe drew back a little, and looked up at the house: the door and the\nwindows were open to the fragrant sun-cured air; from the upper window-\nsills hung festoons of flowers in honour of the festival, as if the\nothers shared in the love for the old house.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Ellen.  \"I hope nothing will spoil it inside; but I don't\nthink it will.  Come! we must go back presently to the others.  They have\ngone on to the tents; for surely they must have tents pitched for the\nhaymakers--the house would not hold a tithe of the folk, I am sure.\"\n\nShe led me on to the door, murmuring little above her breath as she did\nso, \"The earth and the growth of it and the life of it!  If I could but\nsay or show how I love it!\"\n\nWe went in, and found no soul in any room as we wandered from room to\nroom,--from the rose-covered porch to the strange and quaint garrets\namongst the great timbers of the roof, where of old time the tillers and\nherdsmen of the manor slept, but which a-nights seemed now, by the small\nsize of the beds, and the litter of useless and disregarded\nmatters--bunches of dying flowers, feathers of birds, shells of\nstarling's eggs, caddis worms in mugs, and the like--seemed to be\ninhabited for the time by children.\n\nEverywhere there was but little furniture, and that only the most\nnecessary, and of the simplest forms.  The extravagant love of ornament\nwhich I had noted in this people elsewhere seemed here to have given\nplace to the feeling that the house itself and its associations was the\nornament of the country life amidst which it had been left stranded from\nold times, and that to re-ornament it would but take away its use as a\npiece of natural beauty.\n\nWe sat down at last in a room over the wall which Ellen had caressed, and\nwhich was still hung with old tapestry, originally of no artistic value,\nbut now faded into pleasant grey tones which harmonised thoroughly well\nwith the quiet of the place, and which would have been ill supplanted by\nbrighter and more striking decoration.\n\nI asked a few random questions of Ellen as we sat there, but scarcely\nlistened to her answers, and presently became silent, and then scarce\nconscious of anything, but that I was there in that old room, the doves\ncrooning from the roofs of the barn and dovecot beyond the window\nopposite to me.\n\nMy thought returned to me after what I think was but a minute or two, but\nwhich, as in a vivid dream, seemed as if it had lasted a long time, when\nI saw Ellen sitting, looking all the fuller of life and pleasure and\ndesire from the contrast with the grey faded tapestry with its futile\ndesign, which was now only bearable because it had grown so faint and\nfeeble.\n\nShe looked at me kindly, but as if she read me through and through.  She\nsaid: \"You have begun again your never-ending contrast between the past\nand this present.  Is it not so?\"\n\n\"True,\" said I.  \"I was thinking of what you, with your capacity and\nintelligence, joined to your love of pleasure, and your impatience of\nunreasonable restraint--of what you would have been in that past.  And\neven now, when all is won and has been for a long time, my heart is\nsickened with thinking of all the waste of life that has gone on for so\nmany years.\"\n\n\"So many centuries,\" she said, \"so many ages!\"\n\n\"True,\" I said; \"too true,\" and sat silent again.\n\nShe rose up and said: \"Come, I must not let you go off into a dream again\nso soon.  If we must lose you, I want you to see all that you can see\nfirst before you go back again.\"\n\n\"Lose me?\" I said--\"go back again?  Am I not to go up to the North with\nyou?  What do you mean?\"\n\nShe smiled somewhat sadly, and said: \"Not yet; we will not talk of that\nyet.  Only, what were you thinking of just now?\"\n\nI said falteringly: \"I was saying to myself, The past, the present?\nShould she not have said the contrast of the present with the future: of\nblind despair with hope?\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" she said.  Then she caught my hand and said excitedly,\n\"Come, while there is yet time!  Come!\" And she led me out of the room;\nand as we were going downstairs and out of the house into the garden by a\nlittle side door which opened out of a curious lobby, she said in a calm\nvoice, as if she wished me to forget her sudden nervousness: \"Come! we\nought to join the others before they come here looking for us.  And let\nme tell you, my friend, that I can see you are too apt to fall into mere\ndreamy musing: no doubt because you are not yet used to our life of\nrepose amidst of energy; of work which is pleasure and pleasure which is\nwork.\"\n\nShe paused a little, and as we came out into the lovely garden again, she\nsaid: \"My friend, you were saying that you wondered what I should have\nbeen if I had lived in those past days of turmoil and oppression.  Well,\nI think I have studied the history of them to know pretty well.  I should\nhave been one of the poor, for my father when he was working was a mere\ntiller of the soil.  Well, I could not have borne that; therefore my\nbeauty and cleverness and brightness\" (she spoke with no blush or simper\nof false shame) \"would have been sold to rich men, and my life would have\nbeen wasted indeed; for I know enough of that to know that I should have\nhad no choice, no power of will over my life; and that I should never\nhave bought pleasure from the rich men, or even opportunity of action,\nwhereby I might have won some true excitement.  I should have wrecked and\nwasted in one way or another, either by penury or by luxury.  Is it not\nso?\"\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" said I.\n\nShe was going to say something else, when a little gate in the fence,\nwhich led into a small elm-shaded field, was opened, and Dick came with\nhasty cheerfulness up the garden path, and was presently standing between\nus, a hand laid on the shoulder of each.  He said: \"Well, neighbours, I\nthought you two would like to see the old house quietly without a crowd\nin it.  Isn't it a jewel of a house after its kind?  Well, come along,\nfor it is getting towards dinner-time.  Perhaps you, guest, would like a\nswim before we sit down to what I fancy will be a pretty long feast?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I should like that.\"\n\n\"Well, good-bye for the present, neighbour Ellen,\" said Dick.  \"Here\ncomes Clara to take care of you, as I fancy she is more at home amongst\nour friends here.\"\n\nClara came out of the fields as he spoke; and with one look at Ellen I\nturned and went with Dick, doubting, if I must say the truth, whether I\nshould see her again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII: THE FEAST'S BEGINNING--THE END\n\n\nDick brought me at once into the little field which, as I had seen from\nthe garden, was covered with gaily-coloured tents arranged in orderly\nlanes, about which were sitting and lying on the grass some fifty or\nsixty men, women, and children, all of them in the height of good temper\nand enjoyment--with their holiday mood on, so to say.\n\n\"You are thinking that we don't make a great show as to numbers,\" said\nDick; \"but you must remember that we shall have more to-morrow; because\nin this haymaking work there is room for a great many people who are not\nover-skilled in country matters: and there are many who lead sedentary\nlives, whom it would be unkind to deprive of their pleasure in the hay-\nfield--scientific men and close students generally: so that the skilled\nworkmen, outside those who are wanted as mowers, and foremen of the\nhaymaking, stand aside, and take a little downright rest, which you know\nis good for them, whether they like it or not: or else they go to other\ncountrysides, as I am doing here.  You see, the scientific men and\nhistorians, and students generally, will not be wanted till we are fairly\nin the midst of the tedding, which of course will not be till the day\nafter to-morrow.\"  With that he brought me out of the little field on to\na kind of causeway above the river-side meadow, and thence turning to the\nleft on to a path through the mowing grass, which was thick and very\ntall, led on till we came to the river above the weir and its mill.  There\nwe had a delightful swim in the broad piece of water above the lock,\nwhere the river looked much bigger than its natural size from its being\ndammed up by the weir.\n\n\"Now we are in a fit mood for dinner,\" said Dick, when we had dressed and\nwere going through the grass again; \"and certainly of all the cheerful\nmeals in the year, this one of haysel is the cheerfullest; not even\nexcepting the corn-harvest feast; for then the year is beginning to fail,\nand one cannot help having a feeling behind all the gaiety, of the coming\nof the dark days, and the shorn fields and empty gardens; and the spring\nis almost too far off to look forward to.  It is, then, in the autumn,\nwhen one almost believes in death.\"\n\n\"How strangely you talk,\" said I, \"of such a constantly recurring and\nconsequently commonplace matter as the sequence of the seasons.\" And\nindeed these people were like children about such things, and had what\nseemed to me a quite exaggerated interest in the weather, a fine day, a\ndark night, or a brilliant one, and the like.\n\n\"Strangely?\" said he.  \"Is it strange to sympathise with the year and its\ngains and losses?\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" said I, \"if you look upon the course of the year as a\nbeautiful and interesting drama, which is what I think you do, you should\nbe as much pleased and interested with the winter and its trouble and\npain as with this wonderful summer luxury.\"\n\n\"And am I not?\" said Dick, rather warmly; \"only I can't look upon it as\nif I were sitting in a theatre seeing the play going on before me, myself\ntaking no part of it.  It is difficult,\" said he, smiling\ngood-humouredly, \"for a non-literary man like me to explain myself\nproperly, like that dear girl Ellen would; but I mean that I am part of\nit all, and feel the pain as well as the pleasure in my own person.  It\nis not done for me by somebody else, merely that I may eat and drink and\nsleep; but I myself do my share of it.\"\n\nIn his way also, as Ellen in hers, I could see that Dick had that\npassionate love of the earth which was common to but few people at least,\nin the days I knew; in which the prevailing feeling amongst intellectual\npersons was a kind of sour distaste for the changing drama of the year,\nfor the life of earth and its dealings with men.  Indeed, in those days\nit was thought poetic and imaginative to look upon life as a thing to be\nborne, rather than enjoyed.\n\nSo I mused till Dick's laugh brought me back into the Oxfordshire hay-\nfields.  \"One thing seems strange to me,\" said he--\"that I must needs\ntrouble myself about the winter and its scantiness, in the midst of the\nsummer abundance.  If it hadn't happened to me before, I should have\nthought it was your doing, guest; that you had thrown a kind of evil\ncharm over me.  Now, you know,\" said he, suddenly, \"that's only a joke,\nso you mustn't take it to heart.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said I; \"I don't.\"  Yet I did feel somewhat uneasy at his\nwords, after all.\n\nWe crossed the causeway this time, and did not turn back to the house,\nbut went along a path beside a field of wheat now almost ready to\nblossom.  I said:\n\n\"We do not dine in the house or garden, then?--as indeed I did not expect\nto do.  Where do we meet, then?  For I can see that the houses are mostly\nvery small.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, \"you are right, they are small in this country-side:\nthere are so many good old houses left, that people dwell a good deal in\nsuch small detached houses.  As to our dinner, we are going to have our\nfeast in the church.  I wish, for your sake, it were as big and handsome\nas that of the old Roman town to the west, or the forest town to the\nnorth; {3} but, however, it will hold us all; and though it is a little\nthing, it is beautiful in its way.\"\n\nThis was somewhat new to me, this dinner in a church, and I thought of\nthe church-ales of the Middle Ages; but I said nothing, and presently we\ncame out into the road which ran through the village.  Dick looked up and\ndown it, and seeing only two straggling groups before us, said: \"It seems\nas if we must be somewhat late; they are all gone on; and they will be\nsure to make a point of waiting for you, as the guest of guests, since\nyou come from so far.\"\n\nHe hastened as he spoke, and I kept up with him, and presently we came to\na little avenue of lime-trees which led us straight to the church porch,\nfrom whose open door came the sound of cheerful voices and laughter, and\nvaried merriment.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, \"it's the coolest place for one thing, this hot\nevening.  Come along; they will be glad to see you.\"\n\nIndeed, in spite of my bath, I felt the weather more sultry and\noppressive than on any day of our journey yet.\n\nWe went into the church, which was a simple little building with one\nlittle aisle divided from the nave by three round arches, a chancel, and\na rather roomy transept for so small a building, the windows mostly of\nthe graceful Oxfordshire fourteenth century type.  There was no modern\narchitectural decoration in it; it looked, indeed, as if none had been\nattempted since the Puritans whitewashed the mediaeval saints and\nhistories on the wall.  It was, however, gaily dressed up for this latter-\nday festival, with festoons of flowers from arch to arch, and great\npitchers of flowers standing about on the floor; while under the west\nwindow hung two cross scythes, their blades polished white, and gleaming\nfrom out of the flowers that wreathed them.  But its best ornament was\nthe crowd of handsome, happy-looking men and women that were set down to\ntable, and who, with their bright faces and rich hair over their gay\nholiday raiment, looked, as the Persian poet puts it, like a bed of\ntulips in the sun.  Though the church was a small one, there was plenty\nof room; for a small church makes a biggish house; and on this evening\nthere was no need to set cross tables along the transepts; though\ndoubtless these would be wanted next day, when the learned men of whom\nDick has been speaking should be come to take their more humble part in\nthe haymaking.\n\nI stood on the threshold with the expectant smile on my face of a man who\nis going to take part in a festivity which he is really prepared to\nenjoy.  Dick, standing by me was looking round the company with an air of\nproprietorship in them, I thought.  Opposite me sat Clara and Ellen, with\nDick's place open between them: they were smiling, but their beautiful\nfaces were each turned towards the neighbours on either side, who were\ntalking to them, and they did not seem to see me.  I turned to Dick,\nexpecting him to lead me forward, and he turned his face to me; but\nstrange to say, though it was as smiling and cheerful as ever, it made no\nresponse to my glance--nay, he seemed to take no heed at all of my\npresence, and I noticed that none of the company looked at me.  A pang\nshot through me, as of some disaster long expected and suddenly realised.\nDick moved on a little without a word to me.  I was not three yards from\nthe two women who, though they had been my companions for such a short\ntime, had really, as I thought, become my friends.  Clara's face was\nturned full upon me now, but she also did not seem to see me, though I\nknow I was trying to catch her eye with an appealing look.  I turned to\nEllen, and she _did_ seem to recognise me for an instant; but her bright\nface turned sad directly, and she shook her head with a mournful look,\nand the next moment all consciousness of my presence had faded from her\nface.\n\nI felt lonely and sick at heart past the power of words to describe.  I\nhung about a minute longer, and then turned and went out of the porch\nagain and through the lime-avenue into the road, while the blackbirds\nsang their strongest from the bushes about me in the hot June evening.\n\nOnce more without any conscious effort of will I set my face toward the\nold house by the ford, but as I turned round the corner which led to the\nremains of the village cross, I came upon a figure strangely contrasting\nwith the joyous, beautiful people I had left behind in the church.  It\nwas a man who looked old, but whom I knew from habit, now half forgotten,\nwas really not much more than fifty.  His face was rugged, and grimed\nrather than dirty; his eyes dull and bleared; his body bent, his calves\nthin and spindly, his feet dragging and limping.  His clothing was a\nmixture of dirt and rags long over-familiar to me.  As I passed him he\ntouched his hat with some real goodwill and courtesy, and much servility.\n\nInexpressibly shocked, I hurried past him and hastened along the road\nthat led to the river and the lower end of the village; but suddenly I\nsaw as it were a black cloud rolling along to meet me, like a nightmare\nof my childish days; and for a while I was conscious of nothing else than\nbeing in the dark, and whether I was walking, or sitting, or lying down,\nI could not tell.\n\n*  * *\n\nI lay in my bed in my house at dingy Hammersmith thinking about it all;\nand trying to consider if I was overwhelmed with despair at finding I had\nbeen dreaming a dream; and strange to say, I found that I was not so\ndespairing.\n\nOr indeed _was_ it a dream?  If so, why was I so conscious all along that\nI was really seeing all that new life from the outside, still wrapped up\nin the prejudices, the anxieties, the distrust of this time of doubt and\nstruggle?\n\nAll along, though those friends were so real to me, I had been feeling as\nif I had no business amongst them: as though the time would come when\nthey would reject me, and say, as Ellen's last mournful look seemed to\nsay, \"No, it will not do; you cannot be of us; you belong so entirely to\nthe unhappiness of the past that our happiness even would weary you.  Go\nback again, now you have seen us, and your outward eyes have learned that\nin spite of all the infallible maxims of your day there is yet a time of\nrest in store for the world, when mastery has changed into fellowship--but\nnot before.  Go back again, then, and while you live you will see all\nround you people engaged in making others live lives which are not their\nown, while they themselves care nothing for their own real lives--men who\nhate life though they fear death.  Go back and be the happier for having\nseen us, for having added a little hope to your struggle.  Go on living\nwhile you may, striving, with whatsoever pain and labour needs must be,\nto build up little by little the new day of fellowship, and rest, and\nhappiness.\"\n\nYes, surely! and if others can see it as I have seen it, then it may be\ncalled a vision rather than a dream.\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n\n{1}  \"Elegant,\" I mean, as a Persian pattern is elegant; not like a rich\n\"elegant\" lady out for a morning call.  I should rather call that\ngenteel.\n\n{2}  I should have said that all along the Thames there were abundance of\nmills used for various purposes; none of which were in any degree\nunsightly, and many strikingly beautiful; and the gardens about them\nmarvels of loveliness.\n\n{3}  Cirencester and Burford he must have meant.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NEWS FROM NOWHERE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 3261.txt or 3261.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/3/2/6/3261\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
