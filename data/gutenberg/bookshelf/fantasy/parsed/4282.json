Were\nit merely a matter of history there could be no doubts about the\nperiod; but where magic is concerned, to however slight an extent,\nthere must always be some element of mystery, arising partly out of\nignorance and partly from the compulsion of those oaths by which magic\nprotects its precincts from the tiptoe of curiosity.\n\nMoreover, magic, even in small quantities, appears to affect time, much\nas acids affect some metals, curiously changing its substance, until\ndates seem to melt into a mercurial form that renders them elusive even\nto the eye of the most watchful historian.\n\nIt is the magic appearing in Chronicles III and IV that has gravely\naffected the date, so that all I can tell the reader with certainty of\nthe period is that it fell in the later years of the Golden Age in\nSpain.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nTHE FIRST CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE MET AND SAID FAREWELL TO MINE HOST OF THE DRAGON AND KNIGHT\n\nTHE SECOND CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE HIRED A MEMORABLE SERVANT\n\nTHE THIRD CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF WONDER\n\nTHE FOURTH CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE CAME TO THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SUN\n\nTHE FIFTH CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE RODE IN THE TWILIGHT AND SAW SERAFINA\n\nTHE SIXTH CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE SANG TO HIS MANDOLIN AND WHAT CAME OF HIS SINGING\n\nTHE SEVENTH CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE CAME TO SHADOW VALLEY\n\nTHE EIGHTH CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE TRAVELLED FAR\n\nTHE NINTH CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE WON A CASTLE IN SPAIN\n\nTHE TENTH CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE CAME BACK TO LOWLIGHT\n\nTHE ELEVENTH CHRONICLE\n  HOW HE TURNED TO GARDENING AND HIS SWORD RESTED\n\nTHE TWELFTH CHRONICLE\n  THE BUILDING OF CASTLE RODRIGUEZ AND THE ENDING OF THESE CHRONICLES\n\n\n\n\n\nDON RODRIGUEZ\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE MET AND SAID FAREWELL TO MINE HOST OF THE DRAGON AND KNIGHT\n\n\nBeing convinced that his end was nearly come, and having lived long on\nearth (and all those years in Spain, in the golden time), the Lord of\nthe Valleys of Arguento Harez, whose heights see not Valladolid, called\nfor his eldest son. And so he addressed him when he was come to his\nchamber, dim with its strange red hangings and august with the\nsplendour of Spain: \"O eldest son of mine, your younger brother being\ndull and clever, on whom those traits that women love have not been\nbestowed by God; and know my eldest son that here on earth, and for\nought I know Hereafter, but certainly here on earth, these women be the\narbiters of all things; and how this be so God knoweth only, for they\nare vain and variable, yet it is surely so: your younger brother then\nnot having been given those ways that women prize, and God knows why\nthey prize them for they are vain ways that I have in my mind and that\nwon me the Valleys of Arguento Harez, from whose heights Angelico swore\nhe saw Valladolid once, and that won me moreover also ... but that is\nlong ago and is all gone now ... ah well, well ... what was I saying?\"\nAnd being reminded of his discourse, the old lord continued, saying,\n\"For himself he will win nothing, and therefore I will leave him these\nmy valleys, for not unlikely it was for some sin of mine that his\nspirit was visited with dullness, as Holy Writ sets forth, the sins of\nthe fathers being visited on the children; and thus I make him amends.\nBut to you I leave my long, most flexible, ancient Castilian blade,\nwhich infidels dreaded if old songs be true. Merry and lithe it is, and\nits true temper singeth when it meets another blade as two friends sing\nwhen met after many years. It is most subtle, nimble and exultant; and\nwhat it will not win for you in the wars, that shall be won for you by\nyour mandolin, for you have a way with it that goes well with the old\nairs of Spain. And choose, my son, rather a moonlight night when you\nsing under those curved balconies that I knew, ah me, so well; for\nthere is much advantage in the moon. In the first place maidens see in\nthe light of the moon, especially in the Spring, more romance than you\nmight credit, for it adds for them a mystery to the darkness which the\nnight has not when it is merely black. And if any statue should gleam\non the grass near by, or if the magnolia be in blossom, or even the\nnightingale singing, or if anything be beautiful in the night, in any\nof these things also there is advantage; for a maiden will attribute to\nher lover all manner of things that are not his at all, but are only\noutpourings from the hand of God. There is this advantage also in the\nmoon, that, if interrupters come, the moonlight is better suited to the\nplay of a blade than the mere darkness of night; indeed but the merry\nplay of my sword in the moonlight was often a joy to see, it so\nflashed, so danced, so sparkled. In the moonlight also one makes no\nunworthy stroke, but hath scope for those fair passes that Sevastiani\ntaught, which were long ago the wonder of Madrid.\"\n\nThe old lord paused, and breathed for a little space, as it were\ngathering breath for his last words to his son. He breathed\ndeliberately, then spoke again. \"I leave you,\" he said, \"well content\nthat you have the two accomplishments, my son, that are most needful in\na Christian man, skill with the sword and a way with the mandolin.\nThere be other arts indeed among the heathen, for the world is wide and\nhath full many customs, but these two alone are needful.\" And then with\nthat grand manner that they had at that time in Spain, although his\nstrength was failing, he gave to his eldest son his Castilian sword. He\nlay back then in the huge, carved, canopied bed; his eyes closed, the\nred silk curtains rustled, and there was no sound of his breathing. But\nthe old lord's spirit, whatever journey it purposed, lingered yet in\nits ancient habitation, and his voice came again, but feebly now and\nrambling; he muttered awhile of gardens, such gardens no doubt as the\nhidalgos guarded in that fertile region of sunshine in the proudest\nperiod of Spain; he would have known no others. So for awhile his\nmemory seemed to stray, half blind among those perfumed earthly\nwonders; perhaps among these memories his spirit halted, and tarried\nthose last few moments, mistaking those Spanish gardens, remembered by\nmoonlight in Spring, for the other end of his journey, the glades of\nParadise. However it be, it tarried. These rambling memories ceased and\nsilence fell again, with scarcely the sound of breathing. Then\ngathering up his strength for the last time and looking at his son,\n\"The sword to the wars,\" he said. \"The mandolin to the balconies.\" With\nthat he fell back dead.\n\nNow there were no wars at that time so far as was known in Spain, but\nthat old lord's eldest son, regarding those last words of his father as\na commandment, determined then and there in that dim, vast chamber to\ngird his legacy to him and seek for the wars, wherever the wars might\nbe, so soon as the obsequies of the sepulture were ended. And of those\nobsequies I tell not here, for they are fully told in the Black Books\nof Spain, and the deeds of that old lord's youth are told in the Golden\nStories. The Book of Maidens mentions him, and again we read of him in\nGardens of Spain. I take my leave of him, happy, I trust, in Paradise,\nfor he had himself the accomplishments that he held needful in a\nChristian, skill with the sword and a way with the mandolin; and if\nthere be some harder, better way to salvation than to follow that which\nwe believe to be good, then are we all damned. So he was buried, and\nhis eldest son fared forth with his legacy dangling from his girdle in\nits long, straight, lovely scabbard, blue velvet, with emeralds on it,\nfared forth on foot along a road of Spain. And though the road turned\nleft and right and sometimes nearly ceased, as though to let the small\nwild flowers grow, out of sheer good will such as some roads never\nhave; though it ran west and east and sometimes south, yet in the main\nit ran northward, though wandered is a better word than ran, and the\nLord of the Valleys of Arguento Harez who owned no valleys, or anything\nbut a sword, kept company with it looking for the wars. Upon his back\nhe had slung his mandolin. Now the time of the year was Spring, not\nSpring as we know it in England, for it was but early March, but it was\nthe time when Spring coming up out of Africa, or unknown lands to the\nsouth, first touches Spain, and multitudes of anemones come forth at\nher feet.\n\nThence she comes north to our islands, no less wonderful in our woods\nthan in Andalusian valleys, fresh as a new song, fabulous as a rune,\nbut a little pale through travel, so that our flowers do not quite\nflare forth with all the myriad blaze of the flowers of Spain.\n\nAnd all the way as he went the young man looked at the flame of those\nsouthern flowers, flashing on either side of him all the way, as though\nthe rainbow had been broken in Heaven and its fragments fallen on\nSpain. All the way as he went he gazed at those flowers, the first\nanemones of the year; and long after, whenever he sang to old airs of\nSpain, he thought of Spain as it appeared that day in all the wonder of\nSpring; the memory lent a beauty to his voice and a wistfulness to his\neyes that accorded not ill with the theme of the songs he sang, and\nwere more than once to melt proud hearts deemed cold. And so gazing he\ncame to a town that stood on a hill, before he was yet tired, though he\nhad done nigh twenty of those flowery miles of Spain; and since it was\nevening and the light was fading away, he went to an inn and drew his\nsword in the twilight and knocked with the hilt of it on the oaken\ndoor. The name of it was the Inn of the Dragon and Knight. A light was\nlit in one of the upper windows, the darkness seemed to deepen at that\nmoment, a step was heard coming heavily down a stairway; and having\nnamed the inn to you, gentle reader, it is time for me to name the\nyoung man also, the landless lord of the Valleys of Arguento Harez, as\nthe step comes slowly down the inner stairway, as the gloaming darkens\nover the first house in which he has ever sought shelter so far from\nhis father's valleys, as he stands upon the threshold of romance. He\nwas named Rodriguez Trinidad Fernandez, Concepcion Henrique Maria; but\nwe shall briefly name him Rodriguez in this story; you and I, reader,\nwill know whom we mean; there is no need therefore to give him his full\nnames, unless I do it here and there to remind you.\n\nThe steps came thumping on down the inner stairway, different windows\ntook the light of the candle, and none other shone in the house; it was\nclear that it was moving with the steps all down that echoing stairway.\nThe sound of the steps ceased to reverberate upon the wood, and now\nthey slowly moved over stone flags; Rodriguez now heard breathing, one\nbreath with every step, and at length the sound of bolts and chains\nundone and the breathing now very close. The door was opened swiftly; a\nman with mean eyes, and expression devoted to evil, stood watching him\nfor an instant; then the door slammed to again, the bolts were heard\ngoing back again to their places, the steps and the breathing moved\naway over the stone floor, and the inner stairway began again to echo.\n\n\"If the wars are here,\" said Rodriguez to himself and his sword, \"good,\nand I sleep under the stars.\" And he listened in the street for the\nsound of war and, hearing none, continued his discourse. \"But if I have\nnot come as yet to the wars I sleep beneath a roof.\"\n\nFor the second time therefore he drew his sword, and began to strike\nmethodically at the door, noting the grain in the wood and hitting\nwhere it was softest. Scarcely had he got a good strip of the oak to\nlook like coming away, when the steps once more descended the wooden\nstair and came lumbering over the stones; both the steps and the\nbreathing were quicker, for mine host of the Dragon and Knight was\nhurrying to save his door.\n\nWhen he heard the sound of the bolts and chains again Rodriguez ceased\nto beat upon the door: once more it opened swiftly, and he saw mine\nhost before him, eyeing him with those bad eyes; of too much girth, you\nmight have said, to be nimble, yet somehow suggesting to the swift\nintuition of youth, as Rodriguez looked at him standing upon his\ndoor-step, the spirit and shape of a spider, who despite her ungainly\nbuild is agile enough in her way.\n\nMine host said nothing; and Rodriguez, who seldom concerned himself\nwith the past, holding that the future is all we can order the scheme\nof (and maybe even here he was wrong), made no mention of bolts or door\nand merely demanded a bed for himself for the night.\n\nMine host rubbed his chin; he had neither beard nor moustache but wore\nhideous whiskers; he rubbed it thoughtfully and looked at Rodriguez.\nYes, he said, he could have a bed for the night. No more words he said,\nbut turned and led the way; while Rodriguez, who could sing to the\nmandolin, wasted none of his words on this discourteous object. They\nascended the short oak stairway down which mine host had come, the\ngreat timbers of which were gnawed by a myriad rats, and they went by\npassages with the light of one candle into the interior of the inn,\nwhich went back farther from the street than the young man had\nsupposed; indeed he perceived when they came to the great corridor at\nthe end of which was his appointed chamber, that here was no ordinary\ninn, as it had appeared from outside, but that it penetrated into the\nfastness of some great family of former times which had fallen on evil\ndays. The vast size of it, the noble design where the rats had spared\nthe carving, what the moths had left of the tapestries, all testified\nto that; and, as for the evil days, they hung about the place, evident\neven by the light of one candle guttering with every draught that blew\nfrom the haunts of the rats, an inseparable heirloom for all who\ndisturbed those corridors.\n\nAnd so they came to the chamber.\n\nMine host entered, bowed without grace in the doorway, and extended his\nleft hand, pointing into the room. The draughts that blew from the\nrat-holes in the wainscot, or the mere action of entering, beat down\nthe flame of the squat, guttering candle so that the chamber remained\ndim for a moment, in spite of the candle, as would naturally be the\ncase. Yet the impression made upon Rodriguez was as of some old\ndarkness that had been long undisturbed and that yielded reluctantly to\nthat candle's intrusion, a darkness that properly became the place and\nwas a part of it and had long been so, in the face of which the candle\nappeared an ephemeral thing devoid of grace or dignity or tradition.\nAnd indeed there was room for darkness in that chamber, for the walls\nwent up and up into such an altitude that you could scarcely see the\nceiling, at which mine host's eyes glanced, and Rodriguez followed his\nlook.\n\nHe accepted his accommodation with a nod; as indeed he would have\naccepted any room in that inn, for the young are swift judges of\ncharacter, and one who had accepted such a host was unlikely to find\nfault with rats or the profusion of giant cobwebs, dark with the dust\nof years, that added so much to the dimness of that sinister inn. They\nturned now and went back, in the wake of that guttering candle, till\nthey came again to the humbler part of the building. Here mine host,\npushing open a door of blackened oak, indicated his dining-chamber.\nThere a long table stood, and on it parts of the head and hams of a\nboar; and at the far end of the table a plump and sturdy man was seated\nin shirt-sleeves feasting himself on the boar's meat. He leaped up at\nonce from his chair as soon as his master entered, for he was the\nservant at the Dragon and Knight; mine host may have said much to him\nwith a flash of his eyes, but he said no more with his tongue than the\none word, \"Dog\": he then bowed himself out, leaving Rodriguez to take\nthe only chair and to be waited upon by its recent possessor. The\nboar's meat was cold and gnarled, another piece of meat stood on a\nplate on a shelf and a loaf of bread near by, but the rats had had most\nof the bread: Rodriguez demanded what the meat was. \"Unicorn's tongue,\"\nsaid the servant, and Rodriguez bade him set the dish before him, and\nhe set to well content, though I fear the unicorn's tongue was only\nhorse: it was a credulous age, as all ages are. At the same time he\npointed to a three-legged stool that he perceived in a corner of the\nroom, then to the table, then to the boar's meat, and lastly at the\nservant, who perceived that he was permitted to return to his feast, to\nwhich he ran with alacrity. \"Your name?\" said Rodriguez as soon as both\nwere eating. \"Morano,\" replied the servant, though it must not be\nsupposed that when answering Rodriguez he spoke as curtly as this; I\nmerely give the reader the gist of his answer, for he added Spanish\nwords that correspond in our depraved and decadent language of to-day\nto such words as \"top dog,\" \"nut\" and \"boss,\" so that his speech had a\ncertain grace about it in that far-away time in Spain.\n\nI have said that Rodriguez seldom concerned himself with the past, but\nconsidered chiefly the future: it was of the future that he was\nthinking now as he asked Morano this question:\n\n\"Why did my worthy and entirely excellent host shut his door in my\nface?\"\n\n\"Did he so?\" said Morano.\n\n\"He then bolted it and found it necessary to put the chains back,\ndoubtless for some good reason.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Morano thoughtfully, and looking at Rodriguez, \"and so he\nmight. He must have liked you.\"\n\nVerily Rodriguez was just the young man to send out with a sword and a\nmandolin into the wide world, for he had much shrewd sense. He never\npressed a point, but when something had been said that might mean much\nhe preferred to store it, as it were, in his mind and pass on to other\nthings, somewhat as one might kill game and pass on and kill more and\nbring it all home, while a savage would cook the first kill where it\nfell and eat it on the spot. Pardon me, reader, but at Morano's remark\nyou may perhaps have exclaimed, \"That is not the way to treat one you\nlike.\" Not so did Rodriguez. His attention passed on to notice Morano's\nrings which he wore in great profusion upon his little fingers; they\nwere gold and of exquisite work and had once held precious stones, as\nlarge gaps testified; in these days they would have been priceless, but\nin an age when workers only worked at arts that they understood, and\nthen worked for the joy of it, before the word artistic became\nridiculous, exquisite work went without saying; and as the rings were\nslender they were of little value. Rodriguez made no comment upon the\nrings; it was enough for him to have noticed them. He merely noted that\nthey were not ladies' rings, for no lady's ring would have fitted on to\nany one of those fingers: the rings therefore of gallants: and not\ngiven to Morano by their owners, for whoever wore precious stone needed\na ring to wear it in, and rings did not wear out like hose, which a\ngallant might give to a servant. Nor, thought he, had Morano stolen\nthem, for whoever stole them would keep them whole, or part with them\nwhole and get a better price. Besides Morano had an honest face, or a\nface at least that seemed honest in such an inn: and while these\nthoughts were passing through his mind Morano spoke again: \"Good hams,\"\nsaid Morano. He had already eaten one and was starting upon the next.\nPerhaps he spoke out of gratitude for the honour and physical advantage\nof being permitted to sit there and eat those hams, perhaps\ntentatively, to find out whether he might consume the second, perhaps\nmerely to start a conversation, being attracted by the honest looks of\nRodriguez.\n\n\"You are hungry,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Praise God I am always hungry,\" answered Morano. \"If I were not hungry\nI should starve.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"You see,\" said Morano, \"the manner of it is this: my master gives me\nno food, and it is only when I am hungry that I dare to rob him by\nbreaking in, as you saw me, upon his viands; were I not hungry I should\nnot dare to do so, and so ...\" He made a sad and expressive movement\nwith both his hands suggestive of autumn leaves blown hence to die.\n\n\"He gives you no food?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"It is the way of many men with their dog,\" said Morano. \"They give him\nno food,\" and then he rubbed his hands cheerfully, \"and yet the dog\ndoes not die.\"\n\n\"And he gives you no wages?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Just these rings.\"\n\nNow Rodriguez had himself a ring upon his finger (as a gallant should),\na slender piece of gold with four tiny angels holding a sapphire, and\nfor a moment he pictured the sapphire passing into the hands of mine\nhost and the ring of gold and the four small angels being flung to\nMorano; the thought darkened his gaiety for no longer than one of those\nfleecy clouds in Spring shadows the fields of Spain.\n\nMorano was also looking at the ring; he had followed the young man's\nglance.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"do you draw your sword of a night?\"\n\n\"And you?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"I have no sword,\" said Morano. \"I am but as dog's meat that needs no\nguarding, but you whose meat is rare like the flesh of the unicorn need\na sword to guard your meat. The unicorn has his horn always, and even\nthen he sometimes sleeps.\"\n\n\"It is bad, you think, to sleep,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"For some it is very bad, master. They say they never take the unicorn\nwaking. For me I am but dog's meat: when I have eaten hams I curl up\nand sleep; but then you see, master, I know I shall wake in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Rodriguez, \"the morning's a pleasant time,\" and he leaned\nback comfortably in his chair. Morano took one shrewd look at him, and\nwas soon asleep upon his three-legged stool.\n\nThe door opened after a while and mine host appeared. \"It is late,\" he\nsaid. Rodriguez smiled acquiescently and mine host withdrew, and\npresently leaving Morano whom his master's voice had waked, to curl up\non the floor in a corner, Rodriguez took the candle that lit the room\nand passed once more through the passages of the inn and down the great\ncorridor of the fastness of the family that had fallen on evil days,\nand so came to his chamber. I will not waste a multitude of words over\nthat chamber; if you have no picture of it in your mind already, my\nreader, you are reading an unskilled writer, and if in that picture it\nappear a wholesome room, tidy and well kept up, if it appear a place in\nwhich a stranger might sleep without some faint foreboding of disaster,\nthen I am wasting your time, and will waste no more of it with bits of\n\"descriptive writing\" about that dim, high room, whose blackness\ntowered before Rodriguez in the night. He entered and shut the door, as\nmany had done before him; but for all his youth he took some wiser\nprecautions than had they, perhaps, who closed that door before. For\nfirst he drew his sword; then for some while he stood quite still near\nthe door and listened to the rats; then he looked round the chamber and\nperceived only one door; then he looked at the heavy oak furniture,\ncarved by some artist, gnawed by rats, and all blackened by time; then\nswiftly opened the door of the largest cupboard and thrust his sword in\nto see who might be inside, but the carved satyr's heads at the top of\nthe cupboard eyed him silently and nothing moved. Then he noted that\nthough there was no bolt on the door the furniture might be placed\nacross to make what in the wars is called a barricado, but the wiser\nthought came at once that this was too easily done, and that if the\ndanger that the dim room seemed gloomily to forebode were to come from\na door so readily barricadoed, then those must have been simple\ngallants who parted so easily with the rings that adorned Morano's two\nlittle fingers. No, it was something more subtle than any attack\nthrough that door that brought his regular wages to Morano. Rodriguez\nlooked at the window, which let in the light of a moon that was getting\nlow, for the curtains had years ago been eaten up by the moths; but the\nwindow was barred with iron bars that were not yet rusted away, and\nlooked out, thus guarded, over a sheer wall that even in the moonlight\nfell into blackness. Rodriguez then looked round for some hidden door,\nthe sword all the while in his hand, and very soon he knew that room\nfairly well, but not its secret, nor why those unknown gallants had\ngiven up their rings.\n\nIt is much to know of an unknown danger that it really is unknown. Many\nhave met their deaths through looking for danger from one particular\ndirection, whereas had they perceived that they were ignorant of its\ndirection they would have been wise in their ignorance. Rodriguez had\nthe great discretion to understand clearly that he did not know the\ndirection from which danger would come. He accepted this as his only\ndiscovery about that portentous room which seemed to beckon to him with\nevery shadow and to sigh over him with every mournful draught, and to\nwhisper to him unintelligible warnings with every rustle of tattered\nsilk that hung about his bed. And as soon as he discovered that this\nwas his only knowledge he began at once to make his preparations: he\nwas a right young man for the wars. He divested himself of his shoes\nand doublet and the light cloak that hung from his shoulder and cast\nthe clothes on a chair. Over the back of the chair he slung his girdle\nand the scabbard hanging therefrom and placed his plumed hat so that\nnone could see that his Castilian blade was not in its resting-place.\nAnd when the sombre chamber had the appearance of one having undressed\nin it before retiring Rodriguez turned his attention to the bed, which\nhe noticed to be of great depth and softness. That something not unlike\nblood had been spilt on the floor excited no wonder in Rodriguez; that\nvast chamber was evidently, as I have said, in the fortress of some\ngreat family, against one of whose walls the humble inn had once leaned\nfor protection; the great family were gone: how they were gone\nRodriguez did not know, but it excited no wonder in him to see blood on\nthe boards: besides, two gallants may have disagreed; or one who loved\nnot dumb animals might have been killing rats. Blood did not disturb\nhim; but what amazed him, and would have surprised anyone who stood in\nthat ruinous room, was that there were clean new sheets on the bed. Had\nyou seen the state of the furniture and the floor, O my reader, and the\nvastness of the old cobwebs and the black dust that they held, the dead\nspiders and huge dead flies, and the living generation of spiders\ndescending and ascending through the gloom, I say that you also would\nhave been surprised at the sight of those nice clean sheets. Rodriguez\nnoted the fact and continued his preparations. He took the bolster from\nunderneath the pillow and laid it down the middle of the bed and put\nthe sheets back over it; then he stood back and looked at it, much as a\nsculptor might stand back from his marble, then he returned to it and\nbent it a little in the middle, and after that he placed his mandolin\non the pillow and nearly covered it with the sheet, but not quite, for\na little of the curved dark-brown wood remained still to be seen. It\nlooked wonderfully now like a sleeper in the bed, but Rodriguez was not\nsatisfied with his work until he had placed his kerchief and one of his\nshoes where a shoulder ought to be; then he stood back once more and\neyed it with satisfaction. Next he considered the light. He looked at\nthe light of the moon and remembered his father's advice, as the young\noften do, but considered that this was not the occasion for it, and\ndecided to leave the light of his candle instead, so that anyone who\nmight be familiar with the moonlight in that shadowy chamber should\nfind instead a less sinister light. He therefore dragged a table to the\nbedside, placed the candle upon it, and opened a treasured book that he\nbore in his doublet, and laid it on the bed near by, between the candle\nand his mandolin-headed sleeper; the name of the book was Notes in a\nCathedral and dealt with the confessions of a young girl, which the\nauthor claimed to have jotted down, while concealed behind a pillow\nnear the Confessional, every Sunday for the entire period of Lent.\nLastly he pulled a sheet a little loose from the bed, until a corner of\nit lay on the floor; then he lay down on the boards, still keeping his\nsword in his hand, and by means of the sheet and some silk that hung\nfrom the bed, he concealed himself sufficient for his purpose, which\nwas to see before he should be seen by any intruder that might enter\nthat chamber.\n\nAnd if Rodriguez appear to have been unduly suspicious, it should be\nborne in mind not only that those empty rings needed much explanation,\nbut that every house suggests to the stranger something; and that\nwhereas one house seems to promise a welcome in front of cosy fires,\nanother good fare, another joyous wine, this inn seemed to promise\nmurder; or so the young man's intuition said, and the young are wise to\ntrust to their intuitions.\n\nThe reader will know, if he be one of us, who have been to the wars and\nslept in curious ways, that it is hard to sleep when sober upon a\nfloor; it is not like the earth, or snow, or a feather bed; even rock\ncan be more accommodating; it is hard, unyielding and level, all night\nunmistakable floor. Yet Rodriguez took no risk of falling asleep, so he\nsaid over to himself in his mind as much as he remembered of his\ntreasured book, Notes in a Cathedral, which he always read to himself\nbefore going to rest and now so sadly missed. It told how a lady who\nhad listened to a lover longer than her soul's safety could warrant, as\nhe played languorous music in the moonlight and sang soft by her low\nbalcony, and how she being truly penitent, had gathered many roses, the\nemblems of love (as surely, she said at confession, all the world\nknows), and when her lover came again by moonlight had cast them all\nfrom her from the balcony, showing that she had renounced love; and her\nlover had entirely misunderstood her. It told how she often tried to\nshow him this again, and all the misunderstandings are sweetly set\nforth and with true Christian penitence. Sometimes some little matter\nescaped Rodriguez's memory and then he longed to rise up and look at\nhis dear book, yet he lay still where he was: and all the while he\nlistened to the rats, and the rats went on gnawing and running\nregularly, scared by nothing new; Rodriguez trusted as much to their\nmyriad ears as to his own two. The great spiders descended out of such\nheights that you could not see whence they came, and ascended again\ninto blackness; it was a chamber of prodigious height. Sometimes the\nshadow of a descending spider that had come close to the candle assumed\na frightening size, but Rodriguez gave little thought to it; it was of\nmurder he was thinking, not of shadows; still, in its way it was\nominous, and reminded Rodriguez horribly of his host; but what of an\nomen, again, in a chamber full of omens. The place itself was ominous;\nspiders could scarce make it more so. The spider itself was big enough,\nhe thought, to be impaled on his Castilian blade; indeed, he would have\ndone it but that he thought it wiser to stay where he was and watch.\nAnd then the spider found the candle too hot and climbed in a hurry all\nthe way to the ceiling, and his horrible shadow grew less and dwindled\naway.\n\nIt was not that the rats were frightened: whatever it was that happened\nhappened too quietly for that, but the volume of the sound of their\nrunning had suddenly increased: it was not like fear among them, for\nthe running was no swifter, and it did not fade away; it was as though\nthe sound of rats running, which had not been heard before, was\nsuddenly heard now. Rodriguez looked at the door, the door was shut. A\nyoung Englishman would long ago have been afraid that he was making a\nfuss over nothing and would have gone to sleep in the bed, and not seen\nwhat Rodriguez saw. He might have thought that hearing more rats all at\nonce was merely a fancy, and that everything was all right. Rodriguez\nsaw a rope coming slowly down from the ceiling, he quickly determined\nwhether it was a rope or only the shadow of some huge spider's thread,\nand then he watched it and saw it come down right over his bed and stop\nwithin a few feet of it. Rodriguez looked up cautiously to see who had\nsent him that strange addition to the portents that troubled the\nchamber, but the ceiling was too high and dim for him to perceive\nanything but the rope coming down out of the darkness. Yet he surmised\nthat the ceiling must have softly opened, without any sound at all, at\nthe moment that he heard the greater number of rats. He waited then to\nsee what the rope would do; and at first it hung as still as the great\nfestoons dead spiders had made in the corners; then as he watched it it\nbegan to sway. He looked up into the dimness then to see who was\nswaying the rope; and for a long time, as it seemed to him lying\ngripping his Castilian sword on the floor he saw nothing clearly. And\nthen he saw mine host coming down the rope, hand over hand quite\nnimbly, as though he lived by this business. In his right hand he held\na poniard of exceptional length, yet he managed to clutch the rope and\nhold the poniard all the time with the same hand.\n\nIf there had been something hideous about the shadow of the spider that\ncame down from that height the shadow of mine host was indeed demoniac.\nHe too was like a spider, with his body at no time slender all bunched\nup on the rope, and his shadow was six times his size: you could turn\nfrom the spider's shadow to the spider and see that it was for the most\npart a fancy of the candle half crazed by the draughts, but to turn\nfrom mine host's shadow to himself and to see his wicked eyes was to\nsay that the candle's wildest fears were true. So he climbed down his\nrope holding his poniard upward. But when he came within perhaps ten\nfeet of the bed he pointed it downward and began to sway about. It will\nbe readily seen that by swaying his rope at a height mine host could\ndrop on any part of the bed. Rodriguez as he watched him saw him\nscrutinise closely and continue to sway on his rope. He feared that\nmine host was ill satisfied with the look of the mandolin and that he\nwould climb away again, well warned of his guest's astuteness, into the\nheights of the ceiling to devise some fearfuller scheme; but he was\nonly looking for the shoulder. And then mine host dropped; poniard\nfirst, he went down with all his weight behind it and drove it through\nthe bolster below where the shoulder should be, just where we slant our\narms across our bodies, when we lie asleep on our sides, leaving the\nribs exposed: and the soft bed received him. And the moment that mine\nhost let go of his rope Rodriguez leaped to his feet. He saw Rodriguez,\nindeed their eyes met as he dropped through the air, but what could\nmine host do? He was already committed to his stroke, and his poniard\nwas already deep in the mattress when the good Castilian blade passed\nthrough his ribs.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE HIRED A MEMORABLE SERVANT\n\n\nWhen Rodriguez woke, the birds were singing gloriously. The sun was up\nand the air was sparkling over Spain. The gloom had left his high\nchamber, and much of the menace had gone from it that overnight had\nseemed to bode in the corners. It had not become suddenly tidy; it was\nstill more suitable for spiders than men, it still mourned and brooded\nover the great family that it had nursed and that evil days had so\nobviously overtaken; but it no longer had the air of finger to lips, no\nlonger seemed to share a secret with you, and that secret Murder. The\nrats still ran round the wainscot, but the song of the birds and the\njolly, dazzling sunshine were so much larger than the sombre room that\nthe young man's thoughts escaped from it and ran free to the fields. It\nmay have been only his fancy but the world seemed somehow brighter for\nthe demise of mine host of the Dragon and Knight, whose body still lay\nhunched up on the foot of his bed. Rodriguez jumped up and went to the\nhigh, barred window and looked out of it at the morning: far below him\na little town with red roofs lay; the smoke came up from the chimneys\ntoward him slowly, and spread out flat and did not reach so high.\nBetween him and the roofs swallows were sailing.\n\nHe found water for washing in a cracked pitcher of earthenware and as\nhe dressed he looked up at the ceiling and admired mine host's device,\nfor there was an open hole that had come noiselessly, without any\nsounds of bolts or lifting of trap-doors, but seemed to have opened out\nall round on perfectly oiled grooves, to fit that well-to-do body, and\ndown from the middle of it from some higher beam hung the rope down\nwhich mine host had made his last journey.\n\nBefore taking leave of his host Rodriguez looked at his poniard, which\nwas a good two feet in length, not counting the hilt, and was surprised\nto find it an excellent blade. It bore a design on the steel\nrepresenting a town, which Rodriguez recognised for the towers of\nToledo; and had held moreover a jewel at the end of the hilt, but the\nlittle gold socket was empty. Rodriguez therefore perceived that the\nponiard was that of a gallant, and surmised that mine host had begun\nhis trade with a butcher's knife, but having come by the poniard had\nfound it to be handier for his business. Rodriguez being now fully\ndressed, girt his own blade about him, and putting the poniard under\nhis cloak, for he thought to find a use for it at the wars, set his\nplumed hat upon him and jauntily stepped from the chamber. By the light\nof day he saw clearly at what point the passages of the inn had dared\nto make their intrusion on the corridors of the fortress, for he walked\nfor four paces between walls of huge grey rocks which had never been\nplastered and were clearly a breach in the fortress, though whether the\nbreach were made by one of the evil days that had come upon the family\nin their fastness, and whether men had poured through it with torches\nand swords, or whether the gap had been cut in later years for mine\nhost of the Dragon and Knight, and he had gone quietly through it\nrubbing his hands, nothing remained to show Rodriguez now.\n\nWhen he came to the dining-chamber he found Morano astir. Morano looked\nup from his overwhelming task of tidying the Inn of the Dragon and\nKnight and then went on with his pretended work, for he felt a little\nashamed of the knowledge he had concerning the ways of that inn, which\nwas more than an honest man should know about such a place.\n\n\"Good morning, Morano,\" said Rodriguez blithely.\n\n\"Good morning,\" answered the servant of the Dragon and Knight.\n\n\"I am looking for the wars. Would you like a new master, Morano?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Morano, \"a good master is better to some men's minds\nthan a bad one. Yet, you see se\u00f1or, my bad master has me bound never to\nleave him, by oaths that I do not properly understand the meaning of,\nand that might blast me in any world were I to forswear them. He hath\nbound me by San Sathanas, with many others. I do not like the sound of\nthat San Sathanas. And so you see, se\u00f1or, my bad master suits me better\nthan perhaps to be whithered in this world by a levin-stroke, and in\nthe next world who knows?\"\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez, \"there is a dead spider on my bed.\"\n\n\"A dead spider, master?\" said Morano, with as much concern in his voice\nas though no spider had ever sullied that chamber before.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rodriguez, \"I shall require you to keep my bed tidy on our\nway to the wars.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"no spider shall come near it, living or dead.\"\n\nAnd so our company of one going northward through Spain looking for\nromance became a company of two.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"as I do not see him whom I serve, and his ways\nare early ways, I fear some evil has overtaken him, whereby we shall be\nsuspect, for none other dwells here: and he is under special protection\nof the Garda Civil; it would be well therefore to start for the wars\nright early.\"\n\n\"The guard protect mine host then.\" Rodriguez said with as much\nsurprise in his tones as he ever permitted himself.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"it could not be otherwise. For so many gallants\nhave entered the door of this inn and supped in this chamber and never\nbeen seen again, and so many suspicious things have been found here,\nsuch as blood, that it became necessary for him to pay the guard well,\nand so they protect him.\" And Morano hastily slung over his shoulder by\nleather straps an iron pot and a frying-pan and took his broad felt hat\nfrom a peg on the wall.\n\nRodriguez' eyes looked so curiously at the great cooking utensils\ndangling there from the straps that Morano perceived his young master\ndid not fully understand these preparations: he therefore instructed\nhim thus: \"Master, there be two things necessary in the wars, strategy\nand cooking. Now the first of these comes in use when the captains\nspeak of their achievements and the historians write of the wars.\nStrategy is a learned thing, master, and the wars may not be told of\nwithout it, but while the war rageth and men be camped upon the\nfoughten field then is the time for cooking; for many a man that fights\nthe wars, if he hath not his food, were well content to let the enemy\nlive, but feed him and at once he becometh proud at heart and cannot\na-bear the sight of the enemy walking among his tents but must needs\nslay him outright. Aye, master, the cooking for the wars; and when the\nwars are over you who are learned shall study strategy.\"\n\nAnd Rodriguez perceived that there was wisdom in the world that was not\ntaught in the College of San Josephus, near to his father's valleys,\nwhere he had learned in his youth the ways of books.\n\n\"Morano,\" he said, \"let us now leave mine host to entertain la Garda.\"\n\nAnd at the mention of the guard hurry came on Morano, he closed his\nlips upon his store of wisdom, and together they left the Inn of the\nDragon and Knight. And when Rodriguez saw shut behind him that dark\ndoor of oak that he had so persistently entered, and through which he\nhad come again to the light of the sun by many precautions and some\nluck, he felt gratitude to Morano. For had it not been for Morano's\nsinister hints, and above all his remark that mine host would have\ndriven him thence because he liked him, the evil look of the sombre\nchamber alone might not have been enough to persuade him to the\nprecautions that cut short the dreadful business of that inn. And with\nhis gratitude was a feeling not unlike remorse, for he felt that he had\ndeprived this poor man of a part of his regular wages, which would have\nbeen his own gold ring and the setting that held the sapphire, had all\ngone well with the business. So he slipped the ring from his finger and\ngave it to Morano, sapphire and all.\n\nMorano's expressions of gratitude were in keeping with that flowery\nperiod in Spain, and might appear ridiculous were I to expose them to\nthe eyes of an age in which one in Morano's place on such an occasion\nwould have merely said, \"Damned good of you old nut, not half,\" and let\nthe matter drop.\n\nI merely record therefore that Morano was grateful and so expressed\nhimself; while Rodriguez, in addition to the pleasant glow in the mind\nthat comes from a generous action, had another feeling that gives all\nof us pleasure, or comfort at least (until it grows monotonous), a\nfeeling of increased safety; for while he had the ring upon his finger\nand Morano went unpaid the thought could not help occurring, even to a\ngenerous mind, that one of these windy nights Morano might come for his\nwages.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano looking at the sapphire now on his own little\nfinger near the top joint, the only stone amongst his row of rings,\n\"you must surely have great wealth.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rodriguez slapping the scabbard that held his Castilian\nblade. And when he saw that Morano's eyes were staring at the little\nemeralds that were dotted along the velvet of the scabbard he explained\nthat it was the sword that was his wealth:\n\n\"For in the wars,\" he said, \"are all things to be won, and nothing is\nunobtainable to the sword. For parchment and custom govern all the\npossessions of man, as they taught me in the College of San Josephus.\nYet the sword is at first the founder and discoverer of all\npossessions; and this my father told me before he gave me this sword,\nwhich hath already acquired in the old time fair castles with many a\ntower.\"\n\n\"And those that dwelt in the castles, master, before the sword came?\"\nsaid Morano.\n\n\"They died and went dismally to Hell,\" said Rodriguez, \"as the old\nsongs say.\"\n\nThey walked on then in silence. Morano, with his low forehead and\ngreater girth of body than of brain to the superficial observer, was\nnot incapable of thought. However slow his thoughts may have come,\nMorano was pondering surely. Suddenly the puckers on his little\nforehead cleared and he brightly looked at Rodriguez as they went on\nside by side.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"when you choose a castle in the wars, let it\nabove all things be one of those that is easy to be defended; for\ncastles are easily got, as the old songs tell, and in the heat of\ncombat positions are quickly stormed, and no more ado; but, when wars\nare over, then is the time for ease and languorous days and the\nimperilling of the soul, though not beyond the point where our good\nfathers may save it.\"\n\n\"Nay, Morano,\" Rodriguez said, \"no man, as they taught me well in the\nCollege of San Josephus, should ever imperil his soul.\"\n\n\"But, master,\" Morano said, \"a man imperils his body in the wars yet\nhopes by dexterity and his sword to draw it safely thence: so a man of\ncourage and high heart may surely imperil his soul and still hope to\nbring it at the last to salvation.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said Rodriguez, and gave his mind to pondering upon the exact\nteaching he had received on this very point, but could not clearly\nremember.\n\nSo they walked in silence, Rodriguez thinking still of this spiritual\nproblem, Morano turning, though with infinite slowness, to another\nthought upon a lower plane.\n\nAnd after a while Rodriguez' eyes turned again to the flowers, and he\nfelt his meditation, as youth will, and looking abroad he saw the\nwonder of Spring calling forth the beauty of Spain, and he lifted up\nhis head and his heart rejoiced with the anemones, as hearts at his age\ndo: but Morano clung to his thought.\n\nIt was long before Rodriguez' fanciful thoughts came back from among\nthe flowers, for among those delicate earliest blooms of Spring his\nyouthful visions felt they were with familiars; so they tarried,\nneglecting the dusty road and poor gross Morano. But when his fancies\nleft the flowers at last and looked again at Morano, Rodriguez\nperceived that his servant was all troubled with thought: so he left\nMorano in silence for his thought to come to maturity, for he had\nformed a liking already for the judgments of Morano's simple mind.\n\nThey walked in silence for the space of an hour, and at last Morano\nspoke. It was then noon. \"Master,\" he said, \"at this hour it is the\ncustom of la Garda to enter the Inn of the Dragon and to dine at the\nexpense of mine host.\"\n\n\"A merry custom,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"if they find him in less than his usual health\nthey will get their dinners for themselves in the larder and dine and\nafterwards sleep. But after that; master, after that, should anything\ninauspicious have befallen mine host, they will seek out and ask many\nquestions concerning all travellers, too many for our liking.\"\n\n\"We are many good miles from the Inn of the Dragon and Knight,\" said\nRodriguez.\n\n\"Master, when they have eaten and slept and asked questions they will\nfollow on horses,\" said Morano.\n\n\"We can hide,\" said Rodriguez, and he looked round over the plain, very\nfull of flowers, but empty and bare under the blue sky of any place in\nwhich a man might hide to escape from pursuers on horse back. He\nperceived then that he had no plan.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"there is no hiding like disguises.\"\n\nOnce more Rodriguez looked round him over the plain, seeing no houses,\nno men; and his opinion of Morano's judgment sank when he said\ndisguises. But then Morano unfolded to him that plan which up to that\nday had never been tried before, so far as records tell, in all the\nstraits in which fugitive men have been; and which seems from my\nresearches in verse and prose never to have been attempted since.\n\nThe plan was this, astute as Morano, and simple as his naive mind. The\nclothing for which Rodriguez searched the plain vainly was ready to\nhand. No disguise was effective against la Garda, they had too many\nsuspicions, their skill was to discover disguises. But in the moment of\nla Garda's triumph, when they had found out the disguise, when success\nhad lulled the suspicions for which they were infamous, then was the\ntime to trick la Garda. Rodriguez wondered; but the slow mind of Morano\nwas sure, and now he came to the point, the fruit of his hour's\nthinking. Rodriguez should disguise himself as Morano. When la Garda\ndiscovered that he was not the man he appeared to be, a study to which\nthey devoted their lives, their suspicions would rest and there would\nbe an end of it. And Morano should disguise himself as Rodriguez.\n\nIt was a new idea. Had Rodriguez been twice his age he would have\ndiscarded it at once; for age is guided by precedent which, when\npursued, is a dangerous guide indeed. Even as it was he was critical,\nfor the novelty of the thing coming thus from his gross servant\nsurprised him as much as though Morano had uttered poetry of his own\nwhen he sang, as he sometimes did, certain merry lascivious songs of\nSpain that any one of the last few centuries knew as well as any of the\nothers.\n\nAnd would not la Garda find out that he was himself, Rodriguez asked,\nas quickly as they found out he was not Morano.\n\n\"That,\" said Morano, \"is not the way of la Garda. For once let la Garda\ncome by a suspicion, such as that you, master, are but Morano, and they\nwill cling to it even to the last, and not abandon it until they needs\nmust, and then throw it away as it were in disgust and ride hence at\nonce, for they like not tarrying long near one who has seen them\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"They will soon then come by another suspicion,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Not so, master,\" answered Morano, \"for those that are as suspicious as\nla Garda change their suspicions but slowly. A suspicion is an old song\nto them.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Rodriguez, \"I shall be hard set ever to show that I am not\nyou if they ever suspect I am.\"\n\n\"It will be hard, master,\" Morano answered; \"but we shall do it, for we\nshall have truth upon our side.\"\n\n\"How shall we disguise ourselves?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"when you came to our town none knew you and all\nmarked your clothes. As for me my fat body is better known than my\nclothes, yet am I not too well known by la Garda, for, being an honest\nman, whenever la Garda came I used to hide.\"\n\n\"You did well,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Certainly I did well,\" said Morano, \"for had they seen me they might,\non account of certain matters, have taken me to prison, and prison is\nno place for an honest man.\"\n\n\"Let us disguise ourselves,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" answered Morano, \"the brain is greater than the stomach, and\nnow more than at any time we need the counsel of the brain; let us\ntherefore appease the clamours of the stomach that it be silent.\"\n\nAnd he drew out from amongst his clothing a piece of sacking in which\nwas a mass of bacon and some lard, and unslung his huge frying-pan.\nRodriguez had entirely forgotten the need of food, but now the memory\nof it had rushed upon him like a flood over a barrier, as soon as he\nsaw the bacon. And when they had collected enough of tiny inflammable\nthings, for it was a treeless plain, and Morano had made a fire, and\nthe odour of the bacon became perceptible, this memory was hugely\nintensified.\n\n\"Let us eat while they eat, master,\" said Morano, \"and plan while they\nsleep, and disguise ourselves while they pursue.\"\n\nAnd this they did: for after they had eaten they dug up earth and\ngathered leaves with which to fill the gaps in Morano's garments when\nthey should hang on Rodriguez, they plucked a geranium with whose dye\nthey deepened Rodriguez' complexion, and with the sap from the stalk of\na weed Morano toned to a pallor the ruddy brown of his tough cheeks.\nThen they changed clothes altogether, which made Morano gasp: and after\nthat nothing remained but to cut off the delicate black moustachios of\nRodriguez and to stick them to the face of Morano with the juice of\nanother flower that he knew where to find. Rodriguez sighed when he saw\nthem go. He had pictured ecstatic glances cast some day at those\nmoustachios, glances from under long eyelashes twinkling at evening\nfrom balconies; and looking at them where they were now, he felt that\nthis was impossible.\n\nFor one moment Morano raised his head with an air, as it were preening\nhimself, when the new moustachios had stuck; but as soon as he saw, or\nfelt, his master's sorrow at their loss he immediately hung his head,\nshowing nothing but shame for the loss he had caused his master, or for\nthe impropriety of those delicate growths that so ill become his jowl.\nAnd now they took the road again, Rodriguez with the great frying-pan\nand cooking-pot; no longer together, but not too far apart for la Garda\nto take them both at once, and to make the doubly false charge that\nshould so confound their errand. And Morano wore that old triumphant\nsword, and carried the mandolin that was ever young.\n\nThey had not gone far when it was as Morano had said; for, looking\nback, as they often did, to the spot where their road touched the\nsky-line, they saw la Garda spurring, seven of them in their\nunmistakable looped hats, very clear against the sky which a moment ago\nseemed so fair.\n\nWhen the seven saw the two they did not spare the dust; and first they\ncame to Morano.\n\n\"You,\" they said, \"are Rodriguez Trinidad Fernandez, Concepcion\nHenrique Maria, a Lord of the Valleys of Arguento Harez.\"\n\n\"No, masters,\" said Morano.\n\nOh but denials were lost upon la Garda.\n\nDenials inflamed their suspicions as no other evidence could. Many a\nman had they seen with his throat in the hands of the public garrotter;\nand all had begun with denials who ended thus. They looked at the\nmandolin, at the gay cloak, at the emeralds in the scabbard, for\nwherever emeralds go there is evidence to identify them, until the\nnature of man changes or the price of emeralds. They spoke hastily\namong themselves.\n\n\"Without doubt,\" said one of them, \"you are whom we said.\" And they\narrested Morano.\n\nThen they spurred on to Rodriguez. \"You are,\" they said, \"as no man\ndoubts, one Morano, servant at the Inn of the Dragon and Knight, whose\ngood master is, as we allege, dead.\"\n\n\"Masters,\" answered Rodriguez, \"I am but a poor traveller, and no\nservant at any inn.\"\n\nNow la Garda, as I have indicated, will hear all things except denials;\nand thus to receive two within the space of two moments infuriated them\nso fiercely that they were incapable of forming any other theory that\nday except the one they held.\n\nThere are many men like this; they can form a plausible theory and\ngrasp its logical points, but take it away from them and destroy it\nutterly before their eyes, and they will not so easily lash their tired\nbrains at once to build another theory in place of the one that is\nruined.\n\n\"As the saints live,\" they said, \"you are Morano.\" And they arrested\nRodriguez too.\n\nNow when they began to turn back by the way they had come Rodriguez\nbegan to fear overmuch identification, so he assured la Garda that in\nthe next village ahead of them were those who would answer all\nquestions concerning him, as well as being the possessors of the finest\nvintage of wine in the kingdom of Spain.\n\nNow it may be that the mention of this wine soothed the anger caused in\nthe men of la Garda by two denials, or it may be that curiosity guided\nthem, at any rate they took the road that led away from last night's\nsinister shelter, Rodriguez and five of la Garda. Two of them stayed\nbehind with Morano, undecided as yet which way to take, though looking\nwistfully the way that that wine was said to be; and Rodriguez left\nMorano to his own devices, in which he trusted profoundly.\n\nNow Rodriguez knew not the name of the next village that they would\ncome to nor the names of any of the dwellers in it.\n\nYet he had a plan. As he went by the side of one of the horses he\nquestioned the rider.\n\n\"Can Morano write?\" he said. La Garda laughed.\n\n\"Can Morano talk Latin?\" he said. La Garda crossed themselves, all five\nmen. And after some while of riding, and hard walking for Rodriguez, to\nwhom they allowed a hand on a stirrup leather, there came in sight the\ntops of the brown roofs of a village over a fold of the plain. \"Is this\nyour village?\" said one of his captors.\n\n\"Surely,\" answered Rodriguez.\n\n\"What is its name?\" said one.\n\n\"It has many names,\" said Rodriguez.\n\nAnd then another one of them recognised it from the shape of its roofs.\n\"It is Saint Judas-not-Iscariot,\" he said.\n\n\"Aye, so strangers call it,\" said Rodriguez.\n\nAnd where the road turned round that fold of the plain, lolling a\nlittle to its left in the idle Spanish air, they came upon the village\nall in view. I do not know how to describe this village to you, my\nreader, for the words that mean to you what it was are all the wrong\nwords to use. \"Antique,\" \"old-world,\" \"quaint,\" seem words with which\nto tell of it. Yet it had no antiquity denied to the other villages; it\nhad been brought to birth like them by the passing of time, and was\nnursed like them in the lap of plains or valleys of Spain. Nor was it\nquainter than any of its neighbours, though it was like itself alone,\nas they had their characters also; and, though no village in the world\nwas like it, it differed only from the next as sister differs from\nsister. To those that dwelt in it, it was wholly apart from all the\nworld of man.\n\nMost of its tall white houses with green doors were gathered about the\nmarket-place, in which were pigeons and smells and declining sunlight,\nas Rodriguez and his escort came towards it, and from round a corner at\nthe back of it the short, repeated song of one who would sell a\ncommodity went up piercingly.\n\nThis was all very long ago. Time has wrecked that village now.\nCenturies have flowed over it, some stormily, some smoothly, but so\nmany that, of the village Rodriguez saw, there can be now no more than\nwreckage. For all I know a village of that name may stand on that same\nplain, but the Saint Judas-not-Iscariot that Rodriguez knew is gone\nlike youth.\n\nQueerly tiled, sheltered by small dense trees, and standing a little\napart, Rodriguez recognised the house of the Priest. He recognised it\nby a certain air it had. Thither he pointed and la Garda rode. Again he\nspoke to them. \"Can Morano speak Latin?\" he said.\n\n\"God forbid!\" said la Garda.\n\nThey dismounted and opened a gate that was gilded all over, in a low\nwall of round boulders. They went up a narrow path between thick ilices\nand came to the green door. They pulled a bell whose handle was a\nsymbol carved in copper, one of the Priest's mysteries. The bell boomed\nthrough the house, a tiny musical boom, and the Priest opened the door;\nand Rodriguez addressed him in Latin. And the Priest answered him.\n\nAt first la Garda had not realised what had happened. And then the\nPriest beckoned and they all entered his house, for Rodriguez had asked\nhim for ink. Into a room they came where a silver ink-pot was, and the\ngrey plume of the goose. Picture no such ink-pot, my reader, as they\nsell to-day in shops, the silver no thicker than paper, and perhaps a\npattern all over it guaranteed artistic. It was molten silver well\nwrought, and hollowed for ink. And in the hollow there was the magical\nfluid, the stuff that rules the world and hinders time; that in which\nflows the will of a king, to establish his laws for ever; that which\ngives valleys unto new possessors; that whereby towers are held by\ntheir lawful owners; that which, used grimly by the King's judge, is\ndeath; that which, when poets play, is mirth for ever and ever.\n\nNo wonder la Garda looked at it in awe, no wonder they crossed\nthemselves again: and then Rodriguez wrote. In the silence that\nfollowed the jaws of la Garda dropped, while the old Priest slightly\nsmiled, for he somewhat divined the situation already; and, being the\npeople's friend, he loved not la Garda more than he was bound by the\nrules of his duty to man.\n\nThen one of la Garda spoke, bringing back his confidence with a\nbluster. \"Morano has sold his soul to Satan,\" he said, \"in exchange for\nSatan's aid, and Satan has taught his tongue Latin and guides his\nfingers in the affairs of the pen.\" And so said all la Garda, rejoicing\nat finding an explanation where a moment ago there was none, as all men\nat such times do: little it matters what the explanation be: does a man\nin Sahara, who finds water suddenly, inquire with precision what its\nqualities are?\n\nAnd then the Priest said a word and made a sign, against which Satan\nhimself can only prevail with difficulty, and in presence of which his\nspells can never endure. And after this Rodriguez wrote again. Then\nwere la Garda silent.\n\nAnd at length the leader said, and he called on them all to testify,\nthat he had made no charge whatever against this traveller; moreover,\nthey had escorted him on his way out of respect for him, because the\nroads were dangerous, and must now depart because they had higher\nduties. So la Garda departed, looking before them with stern,\npreoccupied faces and urging their horses on, as men who go on an\nerrand of great urgency. And Rodriguez, having thanked them for their\nprotection upon the road, turned back into the house and the two sat\ndown together, and Rodriguez told his rescuer the story of the\nhospitality of the Inn of the Dragon and Knight.\n\nNot as confession he told it, but as a pleasant tale, for he looked on\nthe swift demise of la Garda's friend, in the night, in the spidery\nroom, as a fair blessing for Spain, a thing most suited to the sweet\ndays of Spring. The spiritual man rejoiced to hear such a tale, as do\nall men of peace to hear talk of violent deeds in which they may not\nshare. And when the tale was ended he reproved Rodriguez exceedingly,\nexplaining to him the nature of the sin of blood, and telling him that\nabsolution could be come by now, though hardly, but how on some future\noccasion there might be none to be had. And Rodriguez listened with all\nthe gravity of expression that youth knows well how to wear while its\nthoughts are nimbly dancing far away in fair fields of adventure or\nlove.\n\nAnd darkness came down and lamps were carried in: and the reverend\nfather asked Rodriguez in what other affairs of violence his sword had\nunhappily been. And Rodriguez knew well the history of that sword,\nhaving gathered all that concerned it out of spoken legend or song. And\nalthough the reverend man frowned minatorily whenever he heard of its\npassings through the ribs of the faithful, and nodded as though his\nhead gave benediction when he heard of the destruction of God's most\nvile enemy the infidel, and though he gasped a little through his lips\nwhen he heard of certain tarryings of that sword, in scented gardens,\nwhile Christian knights should sleep and their swords hang on the wall,\nthough sometimes even a little he raised his hands, yet he leaned\nforward always, listening well, and picturing clearly as though his\ngleaming eyes could see them, each doleful tale of violence or sin. And\nso night came, and began to wear away, and neither knew how late the\nhour was. And then as Rodriguez spoke of an evening in a garden, of\nwhich some old song told well, a night in early summer under the\nevening star, and that sword there as always; as he told of his\ngrandfather as poets had loved to tell, going among the scents of the\nhuge flowers, familiar with the dark garden as the moths that drifted\nby him; as he spoke of a sigh heard faintly, as he spoke of danger\nnear, whether to body or soul; as the reverend father was about to\nraise both his hands; there came a thunder of knockings upon the locked\ngreen door.\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIRD CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF WONDER\n\n\nIt was the gross Morano. Here he had tracked Rodriguez, for where la\nGarda goes is always known, and rumour of it remains long behind them,\nlike the scent of a fox. He told no tale of his escape more than a dog\ndoes who comes home some hours late; a dog comes back to his master,\nthat is all, panting a little perhaps; someone perhaps had caught him\nand he escaped and came home, a thing too natural to attempt to speak\nof by any of the signs that a dog knows.\n\nPart of Morano's method seems to have resembled Rodriguez', for just as\nRodriguez spoke Latin, so Morano fell back upon his own natural speech,\nthat he as it were unbridled and allowed to run free, the coarseness of\nwhich had at first astounded, and then delighted, la Garda.\n\n\"And did they not suspect that you were yourself?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"No, master,\" Morano answered, \"for I said that I was the brother of\nthe King of Aragon.\"\n\n\"The King of Aragon!\" Rodriguez said, going to the length of showing\nsurprise. \"Yes, indeed, master.\" said Morano, \"and they recognised me.\"\n\n\"Recognised you!\" exclaimed the Priest.\n\n\"Indeed so,\" said Morano, \"for they said that they were themselves the\nKings of Aragon; and so, father, they recognised me for their brother.\"\n\n\"That you should not have said,\" the Priest told Morano.\n\n\"Reverend father,\" replied Morano, \"as Heaven shines, I believed that\nwhat I said was true.\" And Morano sighed deeply. \"And now,\" he said, \"I\nknow it is true no more.\"\n\nWhether he sighed for the loss of his belief in that exalted\nrelationship, or whether for the loss of that state of mind in which\nsuch beliefs come easily, there was nothing in his sigh to show. They\nquestioned him further, but he said no more: he was here, there was no\nmore to say: he was here and la Garda was gone.\n\nAnd then the reverend man brought for them a great supper, even at that\nlate hour, for many an hour had slipped softly by as he heard the sins\nof the sword; and wine he set out, too, of a certain golden vintage,\nlong lost--I fear--my reader: but this he gave not to Morano lest he\nshould be once more, what the reverend father feared to entertain, that\ndread hidalgo, the King of Aragon's brother. And after that, the stars\nhaving then gone far on their ways, the old Priest rose and offered a\nbed to Rodriguez; and even as he eyed Morano, wondering where to put\nhim, and was about to speak, for he had no other bed, Morano went to a\ncorner of the room and curled up and lay down. And by the time his host\nhad walked over to him and spoken, asking anxiously if he needed\nnothing more, he was almost already asleep, and muttered in answer,\nafter having been spoken to twice, no more than \"Straw, reverend\nfather, straw.\"\n\nAn armful of this the good man brought him, and then showed Rodriguez\nto his room; and they can scarcely have reached it before Morano was\nback in Aragon again, walking on golden shoes (which were sometimes\nwings), proud among lesser princes.\n\nAs precaution for the night Rodriguez took one more glance at his\nhost's kind face; and then, with sword out of reach and an unlocked\ndoor, he slept till the songs of birds out of the deeps of the ilices\nmade sleep any longer impossible.\n\nThe third morning of Rodriguez' wandering blazed over Spain like brass;\nflowers and grass and sky were twinkling all together.\n\nWhen Rodriguez greeted his host Morano was long astir, having awakened\nwith dawn, for the simpler and humbler the creature the nearer it is\nakin to the earth and the sun. The forces that woke the birds and\nopened the flowers stirred the gross lump of Morano, ending his sleep\nas they ended the nightingale's song.\n\nThey breakfasted hurriedly and Rodriguez rose to depart, feeling that\nhe had taken hospitality that had not been offered. But against his\ndeparture was the barrier of all the politeness of Spain. The house was\nhis, said his host, and even the small grove of ilices.\n\nIf I told you half of the things that the reverend man said, you would\nsay: \"This writer is affected. I do not like all this flowery mush.\" I\nthink it safer, my reader, not to tell you any of it. Let us suppose\nthat he merely said, \"Quite all right,\" and that when Rodriguez thanked\nhim on one knee he answered, \"Not at all;\" and that so Rodriguez and\nMorano left. If here it miss some flash of the fair form of Truth it is\nthe fault of the age I write for.\n\nThe road again, dust again, birds and the blaze of leaves, these were\nthe background of my wanderers, until the eye had gone as far as the\neye can roam, and there were the tips of some far pale-blue mountains\nthat now came into view.\n\nThey were still in each other's clothes; but the village was not behind\nthem very far when Morano explained, for he knew the ways of la Garda,\nthat having arrested two men upon this road, they would now arrest two\nmen each on all the other roads, in order to show the impartiality of\nthe Law, which constantly needs to be exhibited; and that therefore all\nmen were safe on the road they were on for a long while to come.\n\nNow there seemed to Rodriguez to be much good sense in what Morano had\nsaid; and so indeed there was for they had good laws in Spain, and they\ndiffered little, though so long ago, from our own excellent system.\nTherefore they changed once more, giving back to each other everything\nbut, alas, those delicate black moustachios; and these to Rodriguez\nseemed gone for ever, for the growth of new ones seemed so far ahead to\nthe long days of youth that his hopes could scarce reach to them.\n\nWhen Morano found himself once more in those clothes that had been with\nhim night and day for so many years he seemed to expand; I mean no\nmetaphor here; he grew visibly fatter.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Morano after a huge breath, \"last night I dreamed, in your\nillustrious clothes, that I was in lofty station. And now, master, I am\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Which were best, think you,\" said Rodriguez, \"if you could have but\none, a lofty place or comfort?\" Even in those days such a question was\ntrite, but Rodriguez uttered it only thinking to dip in the store of\nMorano's simple wisdom, as one may throw a mere worm to catch a worthy\nfish. But in this he was disappointed; for Morano made no neat\ncomparison nor even gave an opinion, saying only, \"Master, while I have\ncomfort how shall I judge the case of any who have not?\" And no more\nwould he say. His new found comfort, lost for a day and night, seemed\nso to have soothed his body that it closed the gates of the mind, as\ntoo much luxury may, even with poets.\n\nAnd now Rodriguez thought of his quest again, and the two of them\npushed on briskly to find the wars.\n\nFor an hour they walked in silence an empty road. And then they came\nupon a row of donkeys; piled high with the bark of the cork-tree, that\nmen were bringing slowly from far woods. Some of the men were singing\nas they went. They passed slow in the sunshine.\n\n\"Oh, master,\" said Morano when they were gone, \"I like not that\nlascivious loitering.\"\n\n\"Why, Morano?\" said Rodriguez. \"It was not God that made hurry.\"\n\n\"Master,\" answered Morano, \"I know well who made hurry. And may he not\novertake my soul at the last. Yet it is bad for our fortunes that these\nmen should loiter thus. You want your castle, master; and I, I want not\nalways to wander roads, with la Garda perhaps behind and no certain\nplace to curl up and sleep in front. I look for a heap of straw in the\ncellar of your great castle.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you shall have it,\" his master said, \"but how do these folks\nhinder you?\" For Morano was scowling at them over his shoulder in a way\nthat was somehow spoiling the gladness of Spring.\n\n\"The air is full of their singing,\" Morano said. \"It is as though their\nsouls were already flying to Hell, and cawing hoarse with sin all the\nway as they go. And they loiter, and they linger...\" Oh, but Morano was\nangry.\n\n\"But,\" said Rodriguez, \"how does their lingering harm you?\"\n\n\"Where are the wars, master? Where are the wars?\" blurted Morano, his\nround face turning redder. \"The donkeys would be dead, the men would be\nrunning, there would be shouts, cries, and confusion, if the wars were\nanywhere near. There would be all things but this.\"\n\nThe men strolled on singing and so passed slow into distance. Morano\nwas right, though I know not how he knew.\n\nAnd now the men and the donkeys were nearly out of sight, but had not\nyet at all emerged from the wrath of Morano. \"Lascivious knaves,\"\nmuttered that disappointed man. And whenever he faintly heard dim\nsnatches of their far song that a breeze here, and another there,\nbrought over the plain as it ran on the errands of Spring, he cursed\ntheir sins under his breath. Though it seemed not so much their sins\nthat moved his wrath as the leisure they had for committing them.\n\n\"Peace, peace, Morano,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"It is that,\" said Morano, \"that is troubling me.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"This same peace.\"\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez, \"I had when young to study the affairs of\nmen; and this is put into books, and so they make history. Now I\nlearned that there is no thing in which men have taken delight, that is\never put away from them; for it seems that time, which altereth every\ncustom, hath altered none of our likings: and in every chapter they\ntaught me there were these wars to be found.\"\n\n\"Master, the times are altered,\" said Morano sadly. \"It is not now as\nin old days.\"\n\nAnd this was not the wisdom of Morano, for anger had clouded his\njudgment. And a faint song came yet from the donkey-drivers, wavering\nover the flowers.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"there are men like those vile sin-mongers, who\nhave taken delight in peace. It may be that peace has been brought upon\nthe world by one of these lousy likings.\"\n\n\"The delight of peace,\" said Rodriguez, \"is in its contrast to war. If\nwar were banished this delight were gone. And man lost none of his\ndelights in any chapter I read.\"\n\nThe word and the meaning of CONTRAST were such as is understood by\nreflective minds, the product of education. Morano felt rather than\nreflected; and the word CONTRAST meant nothing to him. This ended their\nconversation. And the songs of the donkey-drivers, light though they\nwere, being too heavy to be carried farther by the idle air of Spring,\nMorano ceased cursing their sins.\n\nAnd now the mountains rose up taller, seeming to stretch themselves and\nraise their heads. In a while they seemed to be peering over the plain.\nThey that were as pale ghosts, far off, dim like Fate, in the early\npart of the morning, now appeared darker, more furrowed, more sinister,\nmore careworn; more immediately concerned with the affairs of Earth,\nand so more menacing to earthly things.\n\nStill they went on and still the mountains grew. And noon came, when\nSpain sleeps.\n\nAnd now the plain was altering, as though cool winds from the mountains\nbrought other growths to birth, so that they met with bushes straggling\nwild; free, careless and mysterious, as they do, where there is none to\nteach great Nature how to be tidy.\n\nThe wanderers chose a clump of these that were gathered near the way,\nlike gypsies camped awhile midway on a wonderful journey, who at dawn\nwill rise and go, leaving but a bare trace of their resting and no\nguess of their destiny; so fairy-like, so free, so phantasmal those\ndark shrubs seemed.\n\nMorano lay down on the very edge of the shade of one, and Rodriguez lay\nfair in the midst of the shade of another, whereby anyone passing that\nway would have known which was the older traveller. Morano, according\nto his custom, was asleep almost immediately; but Rodriguez, with\nwonder and speculation each toying with novelty and pulling it\ndifferent ways between them, stayed awhile wakeful. Then he too slept,\nand a bird thought it safe to return to an azalea of its own; which it\nlately fled from troubled by the arrival of these two.\n\nAnd Rodriguez the last to sleep was the first awake, for the shade of\nthe shrub left him, and he awoke in the blaze of the sun to see Morano\nstill sheltered, well in the middle now of the shadow he chose. The\ngross sleep of Morano I will not describe to you, reader. I have chosen\na pleasant tale for you in a happy land, in the fairest time of year,\nin a golden age: I have youth to show you and an ancient sword, birds,\nflowers and sunlight, in a plain unharmed by any dream of commerce: why\nshould I show you the sleep of that inelegant man whose bulk lay\ncumbering the earth like a low, unseemly mountain?\n\nRodriguez overtook the shade he had lost and lay there resting until\nMorano awoke, driven all at once from sleep by a dream or by mere\nchoking. Then from the intricacies of his clothing, which to him after\nthose two days was what home is to some far wanderer, Morano drew out\nonce more a lump of bacon. Then came the fry-pan and then a fire: it\nwas the Wanderers' Mess. That mess-room has stood in many lands and has\nonly one roof. We are proud of that roof, all we who belong to that\nMess. We boast of it when we show it to our friends when it is all set\nout at night. It has Aldebaran in it, the Bear and Orion, and at the\nother end the Southern Cross. Yes we are proud of our roof when it is\nat its best.\n\nWhat am I saying? I should be talking of bacon. Yes, but there is a way\nof cooking it in our Mess that I want to tell you and cannot. I've\ntasted bacon there that isn't the same as what you get at the Ritz. And\nI want to tell you how that bacon tastes; and I can't so I talk about\nstars. But perhaps you are one of us, reader, and then you will\nunderstand. Only why the hell don't we get back there again where the\nEvening Star swings low on the wall of the Mess?\n\nWhen they rose from table, when they got up from the earth, and the\nfrying-pan was slung on Morano's back, adding grease to the mere\nsurface of his coat whose texture could hold no more, they pushed on\nbriskly for they saw no sign of houses, unless what Rodriguez saw now\ndimly above a ravine were indeed a house in the mountains.\n\nThey had walked from eight till noon without any loitering. They must\nhave done fifteen miles since the mountains were pale blue. And now,\nevery mile they went, on the most awful of the dark ridges the object\nRodriguez saw seemed more and more like a house. Yet neither then, nor\nas they drew still nearer, nor when they saw it close, nor looking back\non it after years, did it somehow seem quite right. And Morano\nsometimes crossed himself as he looked at it, and said nothing.\n\nRodriguez, as they walked ceaselessly through the afternoon, seeing his\nservant show some sign of weariness, which comes not to youth, pointed\nout the house looking nearer than it really was on the mountain, and\ntold him that he should find there straw, and they would sup and stay\nthe night. Afterwards, when the strange appearance of the house,\nvarying with different angles, filled him with curious forebodings,\nRodriguez would make no admission to his servant, but held to the plan\nhe had announced, and so approached the queer roofs, neglecting the\nfriendly stars.\n\nThrough the afternoon the two travellers pushed on mostly in silence,\nfor the glances that house seemed to give him from the edge of its\nperilous ridge, had driven the mirth from Rodriguez and had even\nchecked the garrulity on the lips of the tougher Morano, if garrulity\ncan be ascribed to him whose words seldom welled up unless some simple\nphilosophy troubled his deeps. The house seemed indeed to glance at\nhim, for as their road wound on, the house showed different aspects,\ndifferent walls and edges of walls, and different curious roofs; all\nthese walls seemed to peer at him. One after another they peered, new\nones glided imperceptibly into sight as though to say, We see too.\n\nThe mountains were not before them but a little to the right of their\npath, until new ones appeared ahead of them like giants arising from\nsleep, and then their path seemed blocked as though by a mighty wall\nagainst which its feeble wanderings went in vain. In the end it turned\na bit to its right and went straight for a dark mountain, where a wild\ntrack seemed to come down out of the rocks to meet it, and upon this\ntrack looked down that sinister house. Had you been there, my reader,\nyou would have said, any of us had said, Why not choose some other\nhouse? There were no other houses. He who dwelt on the edge of the\nravine that ran into that dark mountain was wholly without neighbours.\n\nAnd evening came, and still they were far from the mountain.\n\nThe sun set on their left. But it was in the eastern sky that the\ngreater splendour was; for the low rays streaming across lit up some\nstormy clouds that were brooding behind the mountain and turned their\ngloomy forms to an astounding purple.\n\nAnd after this their road began to rise toward the ridges. The\nmountains darkened and the sinister house was about to merge with\ntheir shadows, when he who dwelt there lit candles.\n\nThe act astonished the wayfarers. All through half the day they had\nseen the house, until it seemed part of the mountains; evil it seemed\nlike their ridges, that were black and bleak and forbidding, and\nstrange it seemed with a strangeness that moved no fears they could\nname, yet it seemed inactive as night.\n\nNow lights appeared showing that someone moved. Window after window\nshowed to the bare dark mountain its gleaming yellow glare; there in\nthe night the house forsook the dark rocks that seemed kin to it, by\nglowing as they could never glow, by doing what the beasts that haunted\nthem could not do: this was the lair of man. Here was the light of\nflame but the rocks remained dark and cold as the wind of night that\nwent over them, he who dwelt now with the lights had forsaken the\nrocks, his neighbours.\n\nAnd, when all were lit, one light high in a tower shone green. These\nlights appearing out of the mountain thus seemed to speak to Rodriguez\nand to tell him nothing. And Morano wondered, as he seldom troubled to\ndo.\n\nThey pushed on up the steepening path.\n\n\"Like you the looks of it?\" said Rodriguez once.\n\n\"Aye, master,\" answered Morano, \"so there be straw.\"\n\n\"You see nothing strange there, then?\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"there be saints for all requirements.\"\n\nAny fears he had felt about that house before, now as he neared it were\ngone; it was time to put away fears and face the event; thus worked\nMorano's philosophy. And he turned his thoughts to the achievements\nupon earth of a certain Saint who met Satan, and showed to the\nsovereign of Hell a discourtesy alien to the ways of the Church.\n\nIt was dark now, and the yellow lights got larger as they drew nearer\nthe windows, till they saw large shadows obscurely passing from room to\nroom. The ascent was steep now and the pathway stopped. No track of any\nkind approached the house. It stood on a precipice-edge as though one\nof the rocks of the mountain: they climbed over rocks to reach it. The\nwindows flickered and blinked at them.\n\nNothing invited them there in the look of that house, but they were now\nin such a forbidding waste that shelter had to be found; they were all\namong edges of rock as black as the night and hard as the material of\nwhich Cosmos was formed, at first upon Chaos' brink. The sound of their\nclimbing ran noisily up the mountain but no sound came from the house:\nonly the shadows moved more swiftly across a room, passed into other\nrooms and came hurrying back. Sometimes the shadows stayed and seemed\nto peer; and when the travellers stood and watched to see what they\nwere they would disappear and there were no shadows at all, and the\nrooms were filled instead with their wondering speculation. Then they\npushed on over rocks that seemed never trodden by man, so sharp were\nthey and slanting, all piled together: it seemed the last waste, to\nwhich all shapeless rocks had been thrown.\n\nMorano and these black rocks seemed shaped by a different scheme;\nindeed the rocks had never been shaped at all, they were just raw\npieces of Chaos. Morano climbed over their edges with moans and\ndiscomfort. Rodriguez heard him behind him and knew by his moans when\nhe came to the top of each sharp rock.\n\nThe rocks became savager, huger, even more sharp and more angular. They\nwere there in the dark in multitudes. Over these Rodriguez staggered,\nand Morano clambered and tumbled; and so they came, breathing hard, to\nthe lonely house.\n\nIn the wall that their hands had reached there was no door, so they\nfelt along it till they came to the corner, and beyond the corner was\nthe front wall of the house. In it was the front door. But so nearly\ndid this door open upon the abyss that the bats that fled from their\ncoming, from where they hung above the door of oak, had little more to\ndo than fall from their crannies, slanting ever so slightly, to find\nthemselves safe from man in the velvet darkness, that lay between\ncliffs so lonely they were almost strangers to Echo. And here they\nfloated upon errands far from our knowledge; while the travellers\ncoming along the rocky ledge between destruction and shelter, knocked\non the oaken door.\n\nThe sound of their knocking boomed huge and slow through the house as\nthough they had struck the door of the very mountain. And no one came.\nAnd then Rodriguez saw dimly in the darkness the great handle of a\nbell, carved like a dragon running down the wall: he pulled it and a\ncry of pain arose from the basement of the house.\n\nEven Morano wondered. It was like a terrible spirit in distress. It was\nlong before Rodriguez dare touch the handle again. Could it have been\nthe bell? He felt the iron handle and the iron chain that went up from\nit. How could it have been the bell! The bell had not sounded: he had\nnot pulled hard enough: that scream was fortuitous. The night on that\nrocky ledge had jangled his nerves. He pulled again and more firmly.\nThe answering scream was more terrible. Rodriguez could doubt no\nlonger, as he sprang back from the bell-handle, that with the chain he\nhad pulled he inflicted some unknown agony.\n\nThe scream had awakened slow steps that now came towards the\ntravellers, down corridors, as it sounded, of stone. And then chains\nfell on stone and the door of oak was opened by some one older than\nwhat man hopes to come to, with small, peaked lips as those of some\nwoodland thing.\n\n\"Se\u00f1ores,\" the old one said, \"the Professor welcomes you.\"\n\nThey stood and stared at his age, and Morano blurted uncouthly what\nboth of them felt. \"You are old, grandfather,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah, Se\u00f1ores,\" the old man sighed, \"the Professor does not allow me to\nbe young. I have been here years and years but he never allowed it. I\nhave served him well but it is still the same. I say to him, 'Master, I\nhave served you long ...' but he interrupts me for he will have none of\nyouth. Young servants go among the villages, he says. And so, and so...\"\n\n\"You do not think your master can give you youth!\" said Rodriguez.\n\nThe old man knew that he had talked too much, voicing that grievance\nagain of which even the rocks were weary. \"Yes,\" he said briefly, and\nbowed and led the way into the house. In one of the corridors running\nout of the hall down which he was leading silently, Rodriguez overtook\nthat old man and questioned him to his face.\n\n\"Who is this professor?\" he said.\n\nBy the light of a torch that spluttered in an iron clamp on the wall\nRodriguez questioned him with these words, and Morano with his\nwondering, wistful eyes. The old man halted and turned half round, and\nlifted his head and answered. \"In the University of Saragossa,\" he said\nwith pride, \"he holds the Chair of Magic.\"\n\nEven the names of Oxford or Cambridge, Harvard or Yale or Princeton,\nmove some respect, and even yet in these unlearned days. What wonder\nthen that the name of Saragossa heard on that lonely mountain awoke in\nRodriguez some emotion of reverence and even awed Morano. As for the\nChair of Magic, it was of all the royal endowments of that illustrious\nUniversity the most honoured and dreaded.\n\n\"At Saragossa!\" Rodriguez muttered.\n\n\"At Saragossa,\" the old man affirmed.\n\nBetween that ancient citadel of learning and this most savage mountain\nappeared a gulf scarce to be bridged by thought.\n\n\"The Professor rests in his mountain,\" the old man said, \"because of a\nconjunction of the stars unfavourable to study, and his class have gone\nto their homes for many weeks.\" He bowed again and led on along that\ncorridor of dismal stone. The others followed, and still as Rodriguez\nwent that famous name Saragossa echoed within his mind.\n\nAnd then they came to a door set deep in the stone, and their guide\nopened it and they went in; and there was the Professor in a mystical\nhat and a robe of dim purple, seated with his back to them at a table,\nstudying the ways of the stars. \"Welcome, Don Rodriguez,\" said the\nProfessor before he turned round; and then he rose, and with small\nsteps backwards and sideways and many bows, he displayed all those\nformulae of politeness that Saragossa knew in the golden age and which\nher professors loved to execute. In later years they became more\nelaborate still, and afterwards were lost.\n\nRodriguez replied rather by instinct than knowledge; he came of a house\nwhose bows had never missed graceful ease and which had in some\ngenerations been a joy to the Court of Spain. Morano followed behind\nhim; but his servile presence intruded upon that elaborate ceremony,\nand the Professor held up his hand, and Morano was held in mid stride\nas though the air had gripped him. There he stood motionless, having\nnever felt magic before. And when the Professor had welcomed Rodriguez\nin a manner worthy of the dignity of the Chair that he held at\nSaragossa, he made an easy gesture and Morano was free again.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano to the Professor, as soon as he found he could\nmove, \"master, it looks like magic.\" Picture to yourself some yokel\nshown into the library of a professor of Greek at Oxford, taking down\nfrom a shelf one of the books of the Odyssey, and saying to the\nProfessor, \"It looks like Greek\"!\n\nRodriguez felt grieved by Morano's boorish ignorance. Neither he nor\nhis host answered him.\n\nThe Professor explained that he followed the mysteries dimly, owing to\na certain aspect of Orion, and that therefore his class were gone to\ntheir homes and were hunting; and so he studied alone under\nunfavourable auspices. And once more he welcomed Rodriguez to his roof,\nand would command straw to be laid down for the man that Rodriguez had\nbrought from the Inn of the Dragon and Knight; for he, the Professor,\nsaw all things, though certain stars would hide everything.\n\nAnd when Rodriguez had appropriately uttered his thanks, he added with\nall humility and delicate choice of phrase a petition that he might be\nshown some mere rudiment of the studies for which that illustrious\nchair in Saragossa was famous. The Professor bowed again and, in\naccepting the well-rounded compliments that Rodriguez paid to the\nhonoured post he occupied, he introduced himself by name. He had been\nonce, he said, the Count of the Mountain, but when his astral studies\nhad made him eminent and he had mastered the ways of the planet nearest\nthe sun he took the title Magister Mercurii, and by this had long been\nknown; but had now forsaken this title, great as it was, for a more\nglorious nomenclature, and was called in the Arabic language the Slave\nof Orion. When Rodriguez heard this he bowed very low.\n\nAnd now the Professor asked Rodriguez in which of the activities of\nlife his interest lay; for the Chair of Magic at Saragossa, he said,\nwas concerned with them all.\n\n\"In war,\" said Rodriguez.\n\nAnd Morano unostentatiously rubbed his hands; for here was one, he\nthought, who would soon put his master on the right way, and matters\nwould come to a head and they would find the wars. But far from\nconcerning himself with the wars of that age, the Slave of Orion\nexplained that as events came nearer they became grosser or more\nmaterial, and that their grossness did not leave them until they were\nsome while passed away; so that to one whose studies were with\naetherial things, near events were opaque and dim. He had a window, he\nexplained, through which Rodriguez should see clearly the ancient wars,\nwhile another window beside it looked on all wars of the future except\nthose which were planned already or were coming soon to earth, and\nwhich were either invisible or seen dim as through mist.\n\nRodriguez said that to be privileged to see so classical an example of\nmagic would be to him both a delight and honour. Yet, as is the way of\nyouth, he more desired to have a sight of the wars than he cared for\nall the learning of the Professor.\n\nAnd to him who held the Chair of Magic at Saragossa it was a precious\nthing that his windows could be made to show these marvels, while the\nguest to whom he was about to display these two gems of his learning\nwas thinking of little but what he should see through the windows, and\nnot at all of what spells, what midnight oil, what incantations, what\nwitchcrafts, what lonely hours among bats, had gone to the\ngratification of his young curiosity. It is usually thus.\n\nThe Professor rose: his cloak floated out from him as he left the\nchamber, and Rodriguez following where he guided saw, by the torchlight\nin the corridors, upon the dim purple border signs that, to his\nuntutored ignorance of magic, were no more than hints of the affairs of\nthe Zodiac. And if these signs were obscure it were better they were\nobscurer, for they dealt with powers that man needs not to possess, who\nhas the whole earth to regulate and control; why then should he seek to\ngovern the course of any star?\n\nAnd Morano followed behind them, hoping to be allowed to get a sight of\nthe wars.\n\nThey came to a room where two round windows were; each of them larger\nthan the very largest plate, and of very thick glass indeed, and of a\nwonderful blue. The blue was like the blue of the Mediterranean at\nevening, when lights are in it both of ships and of sunset, and lights\nof harbours being lit one by one, and the light of Venus perhaps and\nabout two other stars, so deeply did it stare and so twinkled, near its\nedges, with lights that were strange to that room, and so triumphed\nwith its clear beauty over the night outside. No, it was more magical\nthan the Mediterranean at evening, even though the peaks of the\nEsterels be purple and their bases melting in gold and the blue sea\nlying below them smiling at early stars: these windows were more\nmysterious than that; it was a more triumphant blue; it was like the\nMediterranean seen with the eyes of Shelley, on a happy day in his\nyouth, or like the sea round Western islands of fable seen by the fancy\nof Keats. They were no windows for any need of ours, unless our dreams\nbe needs, unless our cries for the moon be urged by the same Necessity\nas makes us cry for bread. They were clearly concerned only with magic\nor poetry; though the Professor claimed that poetry was but a branch of\nhis subject; and it was so regarded at Saragossa, where it was taught\nby the name of theoretical magic, while by the name of practical magic\nthey taught dooms, brews, hauntings, and spells.\n\nThe Professor stood before the left-hand window and pointed to its\ndeep-blue centre. \"Through this,\" he said, \"we see the wars that were.\"\n\nRodriguez looked into the deep-blue centre where the great bulge of the\nglass came out towards him; it was near to the edges where the glass\nseemed thinner that the little strange lights were dancing; Morano\ndared to tiptoe a little nearer. Rodriguez looked and saw no night\noutside. Just below and near to the window was white mist, and the dim\nlines and smoke of what may have been recent wars; but farther away on\na plain of strangely vast dimensions he saw old wars that were. War\nafter war he saw. Battles that long ago had passed into history and had\nbeen for many ages skilled, glorious and pleasant encounters he saw\neven now tumbling before him in their savage confusion and dirt. He saw\na leader, long glorious in histories he had read, looking round\npuzzled, to see what was happening, and in a very famous fight that he\nhad planned very well. He saw retreats that History called routs, and\nrouts that he had seen History calling retreats. He saw men winning\nvictories without knowing they had won. Never had man pried before so\nshamelessly upon History, or found her such a liar. With his eyes on\nthe great blue glass Rodriguez forgot the room, forgot time, forgot his\nhost and poor excited Morano, as he watched those famous fights.\n\nAnd now my reader wishes to know what he saw and how it was that he was\nable to see it.\n\nAs regards the second, my reader will readily understand that the\nsecrets of magic are very carefully guarded, and any smatterings of it\nthat I may ever have come by I possess, for what they are worth,\nsubjects to oaths and penalties at which even bad men shudder. My\nreader will be satisfied that even those intimate bonds between reader\nand writer are of no use to him here. I say him as though I had only\nmale readers, but if my reader be a lady I leave the situation\nconfidently to her intuition. As for the things he saw, of all of these\nI am at full liberty to write, and yet, my reader, they would differ\nfrom History's version: never a battle that Rodriguez saw on all the\nplain that swept away from that circular window, but History wrote\ndifferently. And now, my reader, the situation is this: who am I?\nHistory was a goddess among the Greeks, or is at least a distinguished\npersonage, perhaps with a well-earned knighthood, and certainly with\nwidespread recognition amongst the Right Kind of People. I have none of\nthese things. Whom, then, would you believe?\n\nYet I would lay my story confidently before you, my reader, trusting in\nthe justice of my case and in your judicial discernment, but for one\nother thing. What will the Goddess Clio say, or the well-deserving\nknight, if I offend History? She has stated her case, Sir Bartimeus has\nwritten it, and then so late in the day I come with a different story,\na truer but different story. What will they do? Reader, the future is\ndark, uncertain and long; I dare not trust myself to it if I offend\nHistory. Clio and Sir Bartimeus will make hay of my reputation; an\ninnuendo here, a foolish fact there, they know how to do it, and not a\nsoul will suspect the goddess of personal malice or the great historian\nof pique. Rodriguez gazed then through the deep blue window, forgetful\nof all around, on battles that had not all the elegance or neatness of\nwhich our histories so tidily tell. And as he gazed upon a merry\nencounter between two men on the fringe of an ancient fight he felt a\ntouch on his shoulder and then almost a tug, and turning round beheld\nthe room he was in. How long he had been absent from it in thought he\ndid not know, but the Professor was still standing with folded arms\nwhere he had left him, probably well satisfied with the wonder that his\nmost secret art had awakened in his guest. It was Morano who touched\nhis shoulder, unable to hold back any longer his impatience to see the\nwars; his eyes as Rodriguez turned round were gazing at his master with\ndog-like wistfulness.\n\nThe absurd eagerness of Morano, his uncouth touch on his shoulder,\nseemed only pathetic to Rodriguez. He looked at the Professor's face,\nthe nose like a hawk's beak, the small eyes deep down beside it, dark\nof hue and dreadfully bright, the silent lips. He stood there uttering\nno actual prohibition, concerning which Rodriguez's eyes had sought;\nso, stepping aside from his window, Rodriguez beckoned Morano, who at\nonce ran forward delighted to see those ancient wars.\n\nA slight look of scorn showed faint upon the Professor's face such as\nyou may see anywhere when a master-craftsman perceives the gaze of the\nignorant turned towards his particular subject. But he said no word,\nand soon speech would have been difficult, for the loud clamour of\nMorano filled the room: he had seen the wars and his ecstasies were\nungoverned. As soon as he saw those fights he looked for the Infidels,\nfor his religious mind most loved to see the Infidel slain. And if my\nreader discern or suppose some gulf between religion and the recent\nbusiness of the Inn of the Dragon and Knight, Morano, if driven to\nadmit any connection between murder and his daily bread, would have\nsaid, \"All the more need then for God's mercy through the intercession\nof His most blessed Saints.\" But these words had never passed Morano's\nlips, for shrewd as he was in enquiry into any matter that he desired\nto know, his shrewdness was no less in avoiding enquiry where there\nmight be something that he desired not to know, such as the origin of\nhis wages as servant of the Inn of the Dragon and Knight, those\ndelicate gold rings with settings empty of jewels.\n\nMorano soon recognized the Infidel by his dress, and after that no\nother wars concerned him. He slapped his thigh, he shouted\nencouragement, he howled vile words of abuse, partly because he\nbelieved that this foul abuse was rightly the due of the Infidel, and\npartly because he believed it delighted God.\n\nRodriguez stood and watched, pleased at the huge joy of the simple man.\nThe Slave of Orion stood watching in silence too, but who knows if he\nfelt pleasure or any other emotion? Perhaps his mind was simply like\nours; perhaps, as has been claimed by learned men of the best-informed\nperiod, that mind had some control upon the comet, even when farthest\nout from the paths we know. Morano turned round for a moment to\nRodriguez:\n\n\"Good wars, master, good wars,\" he said with a vast zest, and at once\nhis head was back again at that calm blue window. In that flash of the\nhead Rodriguez had seen his eyes, blue, round and bulging; the round\nman was like a boy who in some shop window has seen, unexpected, huge\nforbidden sweets. Clearly, in the war he watched things were going well\nfor the Cross, for such cries came from Morano as \"A pretty stroke,\"\n\"There now, the dirty Infidel,\" \"Now see God's power shown,\" \"Spare him\nnot, good knight; spare him not,\" and many more, till, uttered faster\nand faster, they merged into mere clamorous rejoicing.\n\nBut the battles beyond the blue window seemed to move fast, and now a\nchange was passing across Morano's rejoicings. It was not that he swore\nmore for the cause of the Cross, but brief, impatient, meaningless\noaths slipped from him now; he was becoming irritable; a puzzled look,\nso far as Rodriguez could see, was settling down on his features. For a\nwhile he was silent except for the little, meaningless oaths. Then he\nturned round from the glass, his hands stretched out, his face full of\nurgent appeal.\n\n\"Masters,\" he said, \"God's enemy wins!\"\n\nIn answer to Morano's pitiful look Rodriguez' hand went to his\nsword-hilt; the Slave of Orion merely smiled with his lips; Morano\nstood there with his hands still stretched out, his face still all\nappeal, and something more for there was reproach in his eyes that men\ncould tarry while the Cross was in danger and the Infidel lived. He did\nnot know that it was all finished and over hundreds of years ago, a\npage of history upon which many pages were turned, and which lay as\nunalterable as the fate of some warm swift creature of early Eocene\ndays over whose fossil today the strata lie long and silent.\n\n\"But can nothing be done, master?\" he said when Rodriguez told him\nthis. And when Rodriguez failed him here, he turned away from the\nwindow. To him the Infidel were game, but to see them defeating\nChristian knights violated the deeps of his feelings.\n\nMorano sulky excited little more notice from his host and his master\nwho had watched his rejoicings, and they seem to have forgotten this\nhumble champion of Christendom. The Professor slightly bowed to\nRodriguez and extended a graceful hand. He pointed to the other window.\n\nReader, your friend shows you his collection of stamps, his fossils,\nhis poems, or his luggage labels. One of them interests you, you look\nat it awhile, you are ready to go away: then your friend shows you\nanother. This also must be seen; for your friend's collection is a\nprecious thing; it is that point upon huge Earth on which his spirit\nhas lit, on which it rests, on which it shelters even (who knows from\nwhat storms?). To slight it were to weaken such hold as his spirit has,\nin its allotted time, upon this sphere. It were like breaking the twig\nof a plant upon which a butterfly rests, and on some stormy day and\nlate in the year.\n\nRodriguez felt all this dimly, but no less surely; and went to the\nother window.\n\nBelow the window were those wars that were soon coming to Spain, hooded\nin mist and invisible. In the centre of the window swam as profound a\nblue, dwindling to paler splendour at the edge, the wandering lights\nwere as lovely, as in the other window just to the left; but in the\nview from the right-hand window how sombre a difference. A bare yard\nseparated the two. Through the window to the left was colour, courtesy,\nsplendour; there was Death at least disguising himself, well cloaked,\ntaking mincing steps, bowing, wearing a plume in his hat and a decent\nmask. In the right-hand window all the colours were fading, war after\nwar they grew dimmer; and as the colours paled Death's sole purpose\nshowed clearer. Through the beautiful left-hand window were killings to\nbe seen, and less mercy than History supposes, yet some of the fighters\nwere merciful, and mercy was sometimes a part of Death's courtly pose,\nwhich went with the cloak and the plume. But in the other window\nthrough that deep, beautiful blue Rodriguez saw Man make a new ally, an\nally who was only cruel and strong and had no purpose but killing, who\nhad no pretences or pose, no mask and no manner, but was only the slave\nof Death and had no care but for his business. He saw it grow bigger\nand stronger. Heart it had none, but he saw its cold steel core\nscheming methodical plans and dreaming always destruction. Before it\nfaded men and their fields and their houses. Rodriguez saw the machine.\n\nMany a proud invention of ours that Rodriguez saw raging on that\nruinous plain he might have anticipated, but not for all Spain would he\nhave done so: it was for the sake of Spain that he was silent about\nmuch that he saw through that window. As he looked from war to war he\nsaw almost the same men fighting, men with always the same attitude to\nthe moment and with similar dim conception of larger, vaguer things;\ngrandson differed imperceptibly from grandfather; he saw them fight\nsometimes mercifully, sometimes murderously, but in all the wars beyond\nthat twinkling window he saw the machine spare nothing.\n\nThen he looked farther, for the wars that were farthest from him in\ntime were farther away from the window. He looked farther and saw the\nruins of Peronne. He saw them all alone with their doom at night, all\ndrenched in white moonlight, sheltering huge darkness in their stricken\nhollows. Down the white street, past darkness after darkness as he went\nby the gaping rooms that the moon left mourning alone, Rodriguez saw a\ncaptain going back to the wars in that far-future time, who turned his\nhead a moment as he passed, looking Rodriguez in the face, and so went\non through the ruins to find a floor on which to lie down for the\nnight. When he was gone the street was all alone with disaster, and\nmoonlight pouring down, and the black gloom in the houses.\n\nRodriguez lifted his eyes and glanced from city to city, to Albert,\nBapaume, and Arras, his gaze moved over a plain with its harvest of\ndesolation lying forlorn and ungathered, lit by the flashing clouds and\nthe moon and peering rockets. He turned from the window and wept.\n\nThe deep round window glowed with serene blue glory. It seemed a\nfoolish thing to weep by that beautiful glass. Morano tried to comfort\nhim. That calm, deep blue, he felt, and those little lights, surely,\ncould hurt no one.\n\nWhat had Rodriguez seen? Morano asked. But that Rodriguez would not\nanswer, and told no man ever after what he had seen through that window.\n\nThe Professor stood silent still: he had no comfort to offer; indeed\nhis magical wisdom had found none for the world.\n\nYou wonder perhaps why the Professor did not give long ago to the world\nsome of these marvels that are the pride of our age. Reader, let us put\naside my tale for a moment to answer this. For all the darkness of his\nsinister art there may well have been some good in the Slave of Orion;\nand any good there was, and mere particle even, would surely have\nspared the world many of those inventions that our age has not spared\nit. Blame not the age, it is now too late to stop; it is in the grip of\ninventions now, and has to go on; we cannot stop content with\nmustard-gas; it is the age of Progress, and our motto is Onwards. And\nif there was no good in this magical man, then may it not have been he\nwho in due course, long after he himself was safe from life, caused our\ninventions to be so deadly divulged? Some evil spirit has done it, then\nwhy not he?\n\nHe stood there silent: let us return to our story.\n\nPerhaps the efforts of poor clumsy Morano to comfort him cheered\nRodriguez and sent him back to the window, perhaps he turned from them\nto find comfort of his own; but, however he came by it, he had a hope\nthat this was a passing curse that had come on the world, whose welfare\nhe cared for whether he lived or died, and that looking a little\nfarther into the future he would see Mother Earth smiling and her\nchildren happy again. So he looked through the deep-blue luminous\nwindow once more, beyond the battles we know. From this he turned back\nshuddering.\n\nAgain he saw the Professor smile with his lips, though whether at his\nown weakness, or whether with cynical mirth at the fate of the world,\nRodriguez could not say.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOURTH CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE CAME TO THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SUN\n\n\nThe Professor said that in curiosity alone had been found the seeds of\nall that is needful for our damnation. Nevertheless, he said, if\nRodriguez cared to see more of his mighty art the mysteries of\nSaragossa were all at his guest's disposal.\n\nRodriguez, sad and horrified though he was, forgot none of his\ncourtesy. He thanked the Professor and praised the art of Saragossa,\nbut his faith in man and his hope for the world having been newly\ndisappointed, he cared little enough for the things we should care to\nsee or for any of the amusements that are usually dear to youth.\n\n\"I shall be happy to see anything, se\u00f1or,\" he said to the Slave of\nOrion, \"that is further from our poor Earth, and to study therein and\nadmire your famous art.\"\n\nThe Professor bowed. He drew small curtains over the windows, matching\nhis cloak. Morano sought a glimpse through the right-hand window before\nthe curtains covered it. Rodriguez held him back. Enough had been seen\nalready, he thought, through that window for the peace of mind of the\nworld: but he said no word to Morano. He held him by the arm, and the\nProfessor covered the windows. When the little mauve curtains were\ndrawn it seemed to Rodriguez that the windows behind them disappeared\nand were there no more; but this he only guessed from uncertain\nindications.\n\nThen the Professor drew forth his wand and went to his cupboard of\nwonder. Thence he brought condiments, oils, and dews of amazement.\nThese he poured into a vessel that was in the midst of the room, a bowl\nof agate standing alone on a table. He lit it and it all welled up in\nflame, a low broad flame of the colour of pale emerald. Over this he\nwaved his wand, which was of exceeding blackness. Morano watched as\nchildren watch the dancer, who goes from village to village when spring\nis come, with some new dance out of Asia or some new song.[Footnote: He\ndoesn't, but why shouldn't he?] Rodriguez sat and waited. The Professor\nexplained that to leave this Earth alive, or even dead, was prohibited\nto our bodies, unless to a very few, whose names were hidden. Yet the\nspirits of men could by incantation be liberated, and being liberated,\ncould be directed on journeys by such minds as had that power passed\ndown to them from of old. Such journeys, he said, were by no means\nconfined by the hills of Earth. \"The Saints,\" exclaimed Morano, \"guard\nus utterly!\" But Rodriguez smiled a little. His faith was given to the\nSaints of Heaven. He wondered at their wonders, he admired their\nmiracles, he had little faith to spare for other marvels; in fact he\ndid not believe the Slave of Orion.\n\n\"Do you desire such a journey?\" said the Professor.\n\n\"It will delight me,\" answered Rodriguez, \"to see this example of your\nart.\"\n\n\"And you?\" he said to Morano.\n\nThe question seemed to alarm the placid Morano, but \"I follow my\nmaster,\" he said.\n\nAt once the Professor stretched out his ebony wand, calling the green\nflame higher. Then he put out his hands over the flame, without the\nwand, moving them slowly with constantly tremulous fingers. And all at\nonce they heard him begin to speak. His deep voice flowed musically\nwhile he scarcely seemed to be speaking but seemed only to be concerned\nwith moving his hands. It came soft, as though blown faint from\nfabulous valleys, illimitably far from the land of Spain. It seemed\nfull not so much of magic as mere sleep, either sleep in an unknown\ncountry of alien men, or sleep in a land dreamed sleeping a long while\nsince. As the travellers heard it they thought of things far away, of\nmythical journeys and their own earliest years.\n\nThey did not know what he said or what language he used. At first\nRodriguez thought Moorish, then he deemed it some secret language come\ndown from magicians of old, while Morano merely wondered; and then they\nwere lulled by the rhythm of those strange words, and so enquired no\nmore. Rodriguez pictured some sad wandering angel, upon some\nmountain-peak of African lands, resting a moment and talking to the\nsolitudes, telling the lonely valley the mysteries of his home. While\nlulled though Morano was he gave up his alertness uneasily. All the\nwhile the green flame flooded upwards: all the while the tremulous\nfingers made curious shadows. The shadow seemed to run to Rodriguez and\nbeckon him thence: even Morano felt them calling. Rodriguez closed his\neyes. The voice and the Moorish spells made now a more haunting melody:\nthey were now like a golden organ on undiscoverable mountains. Fear\ncame on Morano at the thought: who had power to speak like this? He\ngrasped Rodriguez by the wrist. \"Master!\" he said, but at that moment\non one of those golden spells the spirit of Rodriguez drifted away from\nhis body, and out of the greenish light of the curious room; unhampered\nby weight, or fatigue, or pain, or sleep; and it rose above the rocks\nand over the mountain, an unencumbered spirit: and the spirit of Morano\nfollowed.\n\nThe mountain dwindled at once; the Earth swept out all round them and\ngrew larger, and larger still, and then began to dwindle. They saw then\nthat they were launched upon some astounding journey. Does my reader\nwonder they saw when they had no eyes? They saw as they had never seen\nbefore, with sight beyond what they had ever thought to be possible.\nOur eyes gather in light, and with the little rays of light that they\nbring us we gather a few images of things as we suppose them to be.\nPardon me, reader, if I call them things as we suppose them to be; call\nthem by all means Things As They Really Are, if you wish. These images\nthen, this tiny little brainful that we gather from the immensities,\nare all brought in by our eyesight upside-down, and the brain corrects\nthem again; and so, and so we know something. An oculist will tell you\nhow it all works. He may admit it is all a little clumsy, or for the\ndignity of his profession he may say it is not at all. But be this as\nit may, our eyes are but barriers between us and the immensities. All\nour five senses that grope a little here and touch a little there, and\nseize, and compare notes, and get a little knowledge sometimes, they\nare only barriers between us and what there is to know. Rodriguez and\nMorano were outside these barriers. They saw without the imperfections\nof eyesight; they heard on that journey what would have deafened ears;\nthey went through our atmosphere unburned by speed, and were unchilled\nin the bleak of the outer spaces. Thus freed of the imperfections of\nthe body they sped, no less upon a terrible journey, whose direction as\nyet Rodriguez only began to fear.\n\nThey had seen the stars pale rapidly and then the flash of dawn. The\nSun rushed up and at once began to grow larger. Earth, with her curved\nsides still diminishing violently, was soon a small round garden in\nblue and filmy space, in which mountains were planted. And still the\nSun was growing wider and wider. And now Rodriguez, though he knew\nnothing of Sun or planets, perceived the obvious truth of their\nterrible journey: they were heading straight for the Sun. But the\nspirit of Morano was merely astounded; yet, being free of the body he\nsuffered none of those inconveniences that perturbation may bring to\nus: spirits do not gasp, or palpitate, or weaken, or sicken.\n\nThe dwindling Earth seemed now no more than the size of some unmapped\nisland seen from a mountain-top, an island a hundred yards or so\nacross, looking like a big table.\n\nSpeed is comparative: compared to sound, their pace was beyond\ncomparison; nor could any modern projectile attain any velocity\ncomparable to it; even the speed of explosion was slow to it. And yet\nfor spirits they were moving slowly, who being independent of all\nmaterial things, travel with such velocities as that, for instance, of\nthought. But they were controlled by one still dwelling on Earth, who\nused material things, and the material that the Professor was using to\nhurl them upon their journey was light, the adaptation of which to this\npurpose he had learned at Saragossa. At the pace of light they were\ntravelling towards the Sun.\n\nThey crossed the path of Venus, far from where Venus then was, so that\nshe scarcely seemed larger to them; Earth was but little bigger than\nthe Evening Star, looking dim in that monstrous daylight.\n\nCrossing the path of Mercury, Mercury appeared huger than our Moon, an\nobject weirdly unnatural; and they saw ahead of them the terrific glare\nin which Mercury basks, from a Sun whose withering orb had more than\ndoubled its width since they came from the hills of Earth. And after\nthis the Sun grew terribly larger, filling the centre of the sky, and\nspreading and spreading and spreading. It was now that they saw what\nwould have dazzled eyes, would have burned up flesh and would have\nshrivelled every protection that our scientists' ingenuity could have\ndevised even today. To speak of time there is meaningless. There is\nnothing in the empty space between the Sun and Mercury with which time\nis at all concerned. Far less is there meaning in time wherever the\nspirits of men are under stress. A few minutes' bombardment in a\ntrench, a few hours in a battle, a few weeks' travelling in a trackless\ncountry; these minutes, these hours, these weeks can never be few.\n\nRodriguez and Morano had been travelling about six or seven minutes,\nbut it seems idle to say so.\n\nAnd then the Sun began to fill the whole sky in front of them. And in\nanother minute, if minutes had any meaning, they were heading for a\nboundless region of flame that, left and right, was everywhere, and now\ntowered above them, and went below them into a flaming abyss.\n\nAnd now Morano spoke to Rodriguez. He thought towards him, and\nRodriguez was aware of his thinking: it is thus that spirits\ncommunicate.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"when it was all spring in Spain, years ago when I\nwas thin and young, twenty years gone at least; and the butterflies\nwere come, and song was everywhere; there came a maid bare-footed over\na stream, walking through flowers, and all to pluck the anemones.\" How\nfair she seemed even now, how bright that far spring day. Morano told\nRodriguez not with his blundering lips: they were closed and resting\ndeeply millions of miles away: he told him as spirits tell. And in that\nclear communication Rodriguez saw all that shone in Morano's memory,\nthe grace of the young girl's ankles, the thrill of Spring, the\nanemones larger and brighter than anemones ever were, the hawks still\nin clear sky; earth happy and heaven blue, and the dreams of youth\nbetween. You would not have said, had you seen Morano's coarse fat\nbody, asleep in a chair in the Professor's room, that his spirit\ntreasured such delicate, nymph-like, pastoral memories as now shone\nclear to Rodriguez. No words the blunt man had ever been able to utter\nhad ever hinted that he sometimes thought like a dream of pictures by\nWatteau. And now in that awful space before the power of the terrible\nSun, spirit communed with spirit, and Rodriguez saw the beauty of that\nfar day, framed all about the beauty of one young girl, just as it had\nbeen for years in Morano's memory. How shall I tell with words what\nspirit sang wordless to spirit? We poets may compete with each other in\nwords; but when spirits give up the purest gold of their store, that\nhas shone far down the road of their earthly journey, cheering tired\nhearts and guiding mortal feet, our words shall barely interpret.\n\nLove, coming long ago over flowers in Spain, found Morano; words did\nnot tell the story, words cannot tell it; as a lake reflects a cloud in\nthe blue of heaven, so Rodriguez understood and felt and knew this\nmemory out of the days of Morano's youth. \"And so, master,\" said\nMorano, \"I sinned, and would indeed repent, and yet even now at this\nlast dread hour I cannot abjure that day; and this is indeed Hell, as\nthe good father said.\"\n\nRodriguez tried to comfort Morano with such knowledge as he had of\nastronomy, if knowledge it could be called. Indeed, if he had known\nanything he would have perplexed Morano more, and his little pieces of\nignorance were well adapted for comfort. But Morano had given up hope,\nhaving long been taught to expect this very fire: his spirit was no\nwiser than it had been on Earth, it was merely freed of the\nimperfections of the five senses and so had observation and expression\nbeyond those of any artist the world has known. This was the natural\nresult of being freed of the body; but he was not suddenly wiser; and\nso, as he moved towards this boundless flame, he expected every moment\nto see Satan charge out to meet him: and having no hope for the future\nhe turned to the past and fondled the memory of that one spring day.\nHis was a backsliding, unrepentant spirit.\n\nAs that monstrous sea of flame grew ruthlessly larger Rodriguez felt no\nfear, for spirits have no fear of material things: but Morano feared.\nHe feared as spirits fear spiritual things; he thought he neared the\nhome of vast spirits of evil and that the arena of conflict was\neternity. He feared with a fear too great to be borne by bodies.\nPerhaps the fat body that slept on a chair on earth was troubled in\ndreams by some echo of that fear that gripped the spirit so sorely. And\nit may be from such far fears that all our nightmares come.\n\nWhen they had travelled nearly ten minutes from Earth and were about to\npass into the midst of the flame, that magician who controlled their\njourney halted them suddenly in Space, among the upper mountain-peaks\nof the Sun. There they hovered as the clouds hover that leave their\ncompanions and drift among crags of the Alps: below them those awful\nmountains heaved and thundered. All Atlas, and Teneriffe, and lonely\nKenia might have lain amongst them unnoticed. As often as the\nearthquake rocked their bases it loosened from near their summits wild\navalanches of gold that swept down their flaming slopes with\nunthinkable tumult. As they watched, new mountains rode past them,\ncrowned with their frightful flames; for, whether man knew it or not,\nthe Sun was rotating, but the force of its gravity that swung the\nplanets had no grip upon spirits, who were held by the power of that\ntremendous spell that the Professor had learned one midnight at\nSaragossa from one of that dread line who have their secrets from a\nsource that we do not know in a distant age.\n\nThere is always something tremendous in the form of great mountains;\nbut these swept by, not only huger than anything Earth knows, but\ntroubled by horrible commotions, as though overtaken in flight by some\nceaseless calamity.\n\nRodriguez and Morano, as they looked at them, forgetting the gardens of\nEarth, forgetting Spring and Summer and the sweet beneficence of\nsunshine, felt that the purpose of Creation was evil! So shocking a\nthought may well astound us here, where green hills slope to lawns or\npeer at a peaceful sea; but there among the flames of those dreadful\npeaks the Sun seemed not the giver of joy and colour and life, but only\na catastrophe huger than everlasting war, a centre of hideous violence\nand ruin and anger and terror. There came by mountains of copper\nburning everlasting, hurling up to unthinkable heights their mass of\nemerald flame. And mountains of iron raged by and mountains of salt,\nquaking and thundering and clothed with their colours, the iron always\nscarlet and the salt blue. And sometimes there came by pinnacles a\nthousand miles high that from base to summit were fire, mountains of\npure flame that had no other substance. And these explosive mountains,\nborn of thunder and earthquake, hurling down avalanches the size of our\ncontinents, and drawing upward out of the deeps of the Sun new material\nfor splendour and horror, this roaring waste, this extravagant\ndestruction, were necessary for every tint that our butterflies wear on\ntheir wings. Without those flaming ranges of mountains of iron they\nwould have no red to show; even the poppy could have no red for her\npetals: without the flames that were blasting the mountains of salt\nthere could be no answering blue in any wing, or one blue flower for\nall the bees of Earth: without the nightmare light of those frightful\ncanyons of copper that awed the two spirits watching their ceaseless\nruin, the very leaves of the woods we love would be without their green\nwith which to welcome Spring; for from the flames of the various metals\nand wonders that for ever blaze in the Sun, our sunshine gets all its\ncolours that it conveys to us almost unseen, and thence the wise little\ninsects and patient flowers softly draw the gay tints that they glory\nin; there is nowhere else to get them.\n\nAnd yet to Rodriguez and Morano all that they saw seemed wholly and\nhideously evil.\n\nHow long they may have watched there they tried to guess afterwards,\nbut as they looked on those terrific scenes they had no way to separate\ndays from minutes: nothing about them seemed to escape destruction, and\ntime itself seemed no calmer than were those shuddering mountains.\n\nThen the thundering ranges passed; and afterwards there came a gleaming\nmountain, one huge and lonely peak, seemingly all of gold. Had our\nwhole world been set beside it and shaped as it was shaped, that golden\nmountain would yet have towered above it: it would have taken our moon\nas well to reach that flashing peak. It rode on toward them in its\ngolden majesty, higher than all the flames, save now and then when some\nwild gas seemed to flee from the dread earthquakes of the Sun, and was\novertaken in the height by fire, even above that mountain.\n\nAs that mass of gold that was higher than all the world drew near to\nRodriguez and Morano they felt its unearthly menace; and though it\ncould not overcome their spirits they knew there was a hideous terror\nabout it. It was in its awful scale that its terror lurked for any\ncreature of our planet. Though they could not quake or tremble they\nfelt that terror. The mountain dwarfed Earth.\n\nMan knows his littleness, his own mountains remind him; many countries\nare small, and some nations: but the dreams of Man make up for our\nfaults and failings, for the brevity of our lives, for the narrowness\nof our scope; they leap over boundaries and are away and away. But this\ngreat mountain belittled the world and all: who gazed on it knew all\nhis dreams to be puny. Before this mountain Man seemed a trivial thing,\nand Earth, and all the dreams Man had of himself and his home.\n\nThe golden mass drew opposite those two watchers and seemed to\nchallenge with its towering head the pettiness of the tiny world they\nknew. And then the whole gleaming mountain gave one shudder and fell\ninto the awful plains of the Sun. Straight down before Rodriguez and\nMorano it slipped roaring, till the golden peak was gone, and the\nmolten plain closed over it; and only ripples remained, the size of\nEurope, as when a tumbling river strikes the rocks of its bed and on\nits surface heaving circles widen and disappear. And then, as though\nthis horror left nothing more to be shown, they felt the Professor\nbeckon to them from Earth.\n\nOver the plains of the Sun a storm was sweeping in gusts of howling\nflame as they felt the Professor's spell drawing them home. For the\nmagnitude of that storm there are no words in use among us; its\nvelocity, if expressed in figures, would have no meaning; its heat was\nimmeasurable. Suffice it to say that if such a tempest could have swept\nover Earth for a second, both the poles would have boiled. The\ntravellers left it galloping over that plain, rippled from underneath\nby the restless earthquake and whipped into flaming foam by the force\nof the storm. The Sun already was receding from them, already growing\nsmaller. Soon the storm seemed but a cloud of light sweeping over the\nempty plain, like a murderous mourner rushing swiftly away from the\ngrave of that mighty mountain.\n\nAnd now the Professor's spell gripped them in earnest: rapidly the Sun\ngrew smaller. As swiftly as he had sent them upon that journey he was\nnow drawing them home. They overtook thunders that they had heard\nalready, and passed them, and came again to the silent spaces which the\nthunders of the Sun are unable to cross, so that even Mercury is\nundisturbed by them.\n\nI have said that spirits neither fade nor weary. But a great sadness\nwas on them; they felt as men feel who come whole away from periods of\nperil. They had seen cataclysms too vast for our imagination, and a\nmournfulness and a satiety were upon them. They could have gazed at one\nflower for days and needed no other experience, as a wounded man may be\nhappy staring at the flame of a candle.\n\nCrossing the paths of Mercury and Venus, they saw that these planets\nhad not appreciably moved, and Rodriguez, who knew that planets wander\nin the night, guessed thereby that they had not been absent from Earth\nfor many hours.\n\nThey rejoiced to see the Sun diminishing steadily. Only for a moment as\nthey started their journey had they seen that solar storm rushing over\nthe plains of the Sun; but now it appeared to hang halted in its mid\nanger, as though blasting one region eternally.\n\nMoving on with the pace of light, they saw Earth, soon after crossing\nthe path of Venus, beginning to grow larger than a star. Never had home\nappeared more welcome to wanderers, who see their house far off,\nreturning home.\n\nAnd as Earth grew larger, and they began to see forms that seemed like\nseas and mountains, they looked for their own country, but could not\nfind it: for, travelling straight from the Sun, they approached that\npart of the world that was then turned towards it, and were heading\nstraight for China, while Spain lay still in darkness.\n\nBut when they came near Earth and its mountains were clear, then the\nProfessor drew them across the world, into the darkness and over Spain;\nso that those two spirits ended their marvellous journey much as the\nsnipe ends his, a drop out of heaven and a swoop low over marshes. So\nthey came home, while Earth seemed calling to them with all her voices;\nwith memories, sights and scents, and little sounds; calling anxiously,\nas though they had been too long away and must be home soon. They heard\na cock crow on the edge of the night; they heard more little sounds\nthan words can say; only the organ can hint at them. It was Earth\ncalling. For, talk as we may of our dreams that transcend this sphere,\nor our hopes that build beyond it, Mother Earth has yet a mighty hold\nupon us; and her myriad sounds were blending in one cry now, knowing\nthat it was late and that these two children of hers were nearly lost.\nFor our spirits that sometimes cross the path of the angels, and on\nrare evenings hear a word of their talk, and have brief equality with\nthe Powers of Light, have the duty also of moving fingers and toes,\nwhich freeze if our proud spirits forget their task for too long.\n\nAnd just as Earth was despairing they reached the Professor's mountain\nand entered the room in which their bodies were.\n\nBlue and cold and ugly looked the body of Morano, but for all its\npallor there was beauty in the young face of Rodriguez.\n\nThe Professor stood before them as he had stood when their spirits\nleft, with the table between him and the bodies, and the bowl on the\ntable which held the green flame, now low and flickering desperately,\nwhich the Professor watched as it leaped and failed, with an air of\nanxiety that seemed to pinch his thin features.\n\nWith an impatience strange to him he waved a swift hand towards each of\nthe two bodies where they sat stiff, illumined by the last of the green\nlight; and at those rapid gestures the travellers returned to their\nhabitations.\n\nThey seemed to be just awakening out of deep sleep. Again they saw the\nProfessor standing before them. But they saw him only with blinking\neyes, they saw him only as eyes can see, guessing at his mind from the\nlines of his face, at his thoughts from the movements of his hands,\nguessing as men guess, blindly: only a moment before they had known him\nutterly. Now they were dazed and forgetting: slow blood began to creep\nagain to their toes and to come again to its place under fingernails:\nit came with intense pain: they forgot their spirits. Then all the woes\nof Earth crowded their minds at once, so that they wished to weep, as\ninfants weep.\n\nThe Professor gave this mood time to change, as change it presently\ndid. For the warm blood came back and lit their cheeks, and a tingling\nsucceeded the pain in their fingers and toes, and a mild warmth\nsucceeded the tingling: their thoughts came back to the things of every\nday, to mundane things and the affairs of the body. Therein they\nrejoiced, and Morano no less than Rodriguez; though it was a coarse and\ncommon body that Morano's spirit inhabited. And when the Professor saw\nthat the first sorrow of Earth, which all spirits feel when they land\nhere, had passed away, and that they were feeling again the joy of\nmundane things, only then did he speak.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" he said, \"beyond the path of Mars run many worlds that I would\nhave you know. The greatest of these is Jupiter, towards whom all that\nfollow my most sacred art show reverent affection. The smallest are\nthose that sometimes strike our world, flaming all green upon November\nnights, and are even as small as apples.\" He spoke of our world with a\ncertain air and a pride, as though, through virtue of his transcendent\nart, the world were only his. \"The world that we name Argola,\" he said,\n\"is far smaller than Spain and, being invisible from Earth, is only\nknown to the few who have spoken to spirits whose wanderings have\nsurpassed the path of Mars. Nearly half of Argola you shall find\ncovered with forests, which though very dense are no deeper than moss,\nand the elephants in them are not larger than beetles. You shall see\nmany wonders of smallness in this world of Argola, which I desire in\nespecial to show you, since it is the orb with which we who study the\nArt are most familiar, of all the worlds that the vulgar have not\nknown. It is indeed the prize of our traffic in those things that far\ntranscend the laws that have forbidden them.\"\n\nAnd as he said this the green flame in the bowl before him died, and he\nmoved towards his cupboard of wonder. Rodriguez hastily thanked the\nProfessor for his great courtesy in laying bare before him secrets that\nthe centuries hid, and then he referred to his own great unworthiness,\nto the lateness of the hour, to the fatigue of the Professor, and to\nthe importance to Learning of adequate rest to refresh his illustrious\nmind. And all that he said the Professor parried with bows, and drew\nenchantments from his cupboard of wonder to replenish the bowl on the\ntable. And Rodriguez saw that he was in the clutch of a collector, one\nwho having devoted all his days to a hobby will exhibit his treasures\nto the uttermost, and that the stars that magic knows were no less to\nthe Professor than all the whatnots that a man collects and insists on\nshowing to whomsoever enters his house. He feared some terrible\njourney, perhaps some bare escape; for though no material thing can\nquite encompass a spirit, he knew not what wanderers he might not meet\nin lonely spaces beyond the path of Mars. So when his last polite\nremonstrance failed, being turned aside with a pleasant phrase and a\nsmile from the grim lips, and looking at Morano he saw that he shared\nhis fears, then he determined to show whatever resistance were needed\nto keep himself and Morano in this old world that we know, or that\nyouth at least believes that it knows.\n\nHe watched the Professor return with his packets of wonder; dust from a\nfallen star, phials of tears of lost lovers, poison and gold out of\nelf-land, and all manner of things. But the moment that he put them\ninto the bowl Rodriguez' hand flew to his sword-hilt. He heaved up his\nelbow, but no sword came forth, for it lay magnetised to its scabbard\nby the grip of a current of magic. When Rodriguez saw this he knew not\nwhat to do.\n\nThe Professor went on pouring into the bowl. He added an odour\ndistilled out of dream-roses, three drops from the gall-bladder of a\nfabulous beast, and a little dust that had been man. More too he added,\nso that my reader might wonder were I to tell him all; yet it is not so\neasy to free our spirits from the gross grip of our bodies. Wonder not\nthen, my reader, if the Professor exerted strange powers. And all the\nwhile Morano was picking at a nail that fastened on the handle to his\nfrying-pan.\n\nAnd just as the last few mysteries were shaken into the bowl,--and\nthere were two among them of which even Asia is ignorant,--just as the\ndews were blended with the powers in a grey-green sinister harmony,\nMorano untwisted his nail and got the handle loose.\n\nThe Professor kindled the mixture in the bowl; again green flame arose,\nagain that voice of his began to call to their spirits, and its beauty\nand the power of its spell were as of some fallen angel. The spirit of\nRodriguez was nearly passing helplessly forth again on some frightful\njourney, when Morano losed his scabbard and sword from its girdle and\ntied the handle of his frying-pan across it a little below the hilt\nwith a piece of string. Across the table the Professor intoned his\nspell, across a narrow table, but it seemed to come from the far side\nof the twilight, a twilight red and golden in long layers, of an\nevening wonderfully long ago. It seemed to take its music out of the\nlights that it flowed through and to call Rodriguez from immediately\nfar away, with a call which it were sacrilege to refuse, and anguish\neven, and hard toil such as there was no strength to do. And then\nMorano held up the sword in its scabbard with the handle of the\nfrying-pan tied across. Rodriguez, disturbed by a stammer in the spell,\nlooked up and saw the Professor staring at the sword where Morano held\nit up before his face in the green light of the flame from the bowl. He\ndid not seem like a fallen angel now. His spell had stopped. He seemed\nlike a professor who had forgotten the theme of his lecture, while the\nclass waits. For Morano was holding up the sign of the cross.\n\n\"You have betrayed me!\" shouted the Slave of Orion: the green flame\ndied, and he strode out of the room, his purple cloak floating behind\nhim.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"it was always good against magic.\"\n\nThe sword was loose in the scabbard as Rodriguez took it back; there\nwas no longer a current of magic gripping the steel.\n\nA little uneasily Rodriguez thanked Morano: he was not sure if Morano\nhad behaved as a guest's servant should. But when he thought of the\nProfessor's terrible spells, which had driven them to the awful crags\nof the sun, and might send them who knows where to hob-nob with who\nknows what, his second thoughts perceived that Morano was right to cut\nshort those arts that the Slave of Orion loved, even by so extreme a\nstep: and he praised Morano as his ready shrewdness deserved.\n\n\"We were very nearly too late back from that outing, master,\" remarked\nMorano.\n\n\"How know you that?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"This old body knew,\" said Morano. \"Those heart-thumpings, this\nwarmness, and all the things that make a fat body comfortable, they\nwere stopping, master, they were spoiling, they were getting cold and\nstrange: I go no more errands for that se\u00f1or.\"\n\nA certain diffidence about criticising his host even now; and a very\npractical vein that ran through his nature, now showing itself in\nanxiety for a bed at so late an hour, led Rodriguez to change the\nsubject. He wanted that aged butler, yet dare not ring the bell; for he\nfeared lest with all the bells there might be in use that frightful\npractice that he had met by the outer door, a chain connected with some\nhideous hook that gave anguish to something in the basement whenever\none touched the handle, so that the menials of that grim Professor were\nshrilly summoned by screams. And therefore Rodriguez sought counsel of\nMorano, who straightway volunteered to find the butler's quarters, by a\ncertain sense that he had of the fitness of things: and forth he went,\nbut would not leave the room without the scabbard and the handle of the\nfrying-pan lashed to it, which he bore high before him in both his\nhands as though he were leading some austere procession. And even so he\nreturned with that aged man the butler, who led them down dim corridors\nof stone; but, though he showed the way, Morano would go in front,\nstill holding up that scabbard and handle before him, while Rodriguez\nheld the bare sword. And so they came to a room lit by the flare of one\ncandle, which their guide told them the Professor had prepared for his\nguest. In the vastness of it was a great bed. Shadows and a whir as of\nwings passed out of the door as they entered. \"Bats,\" said the ancient\nguide. But Morano believed he had routed powers of evil with the handle\nof his frying-pan and his master's scabbard. Who could say what they\nwere in such a house, where bats and evil spirits sheltered perennially\nfrom the brooms of the just? Then that ancient man with the lips of\nsome woodland thing departed, and Rodriguez went to the great bed. On a\npile of straw that had been cast into the room Morano lay down across\nthe door, setting the scabbard upright in a rat-hole near his head,\nwhile Rodriguez lay down with the bare sword in his hand. There was\nonly one door in the room, and this Morano guarded. Windows there were,\nbut they were shuttered with raw oak of enormous thickness. He had\nalready enquired with his sword behind the velvet curtains. He felt\nsecure in the bulk of Morano across the only door, at least from\ncreatures of this world: and Morano feared no longer either spirit or\nspell, believing that he had vanquished the Professor with his symbol,\nand all such allies as he may have had here or elsewhere. But not thus\neasily do we overcome the powers of evil.\n\nA step was heard such as man walks with at the close of his later\nyears, coming along the corridor of stone; and they knew it for the\nProfessor's butler returning. The latch of the door trembled and\nlifted, and the great oak door bumped slowly against Morano, who arose\ngrumbling, and the old man appeared.\n\n\"The Professor,\" he said, while Morano watched him grudgingly, \"returns\nwith all his household to Saragossa at once, to resume those studies\nfor which his name resounds, a certain conjunction of the stars having\ncome favourably.\"\n\nEven Morano doubted that so suddenly the courses of the stars, which he\ndeemed to be gradual, should have altered from antagonism towards the\nProfessor's art into a favourable aspect. Rodriguez sleepily\nacknowledged the news and settled himself to sleep, still sword in\nhand, when the servitor repeated with as much emphasis as his aged\nvoice could utter, \"With all his household, se\u00f1or.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" muttered Rodriguez. \"Farewell.\"\n\nAnd repeating again, \"He takes his household with him,\" the old man\nshuffled back from the room and hesitatingly closed the door. Before\nthe sound of his slow footsteps had failed to reach the room Morano was\nasleep under his cross. Rodriguez still watched for a while the shadows\nleaping and shuddering away from the candle, riding over the ceiling,\nstriding hugely along the walls, towards him and from him, as draughts\nswayed the ruddy flame; then, gripping his sword still firmer in his\nhand, as though that could avail against magic, he fell into the sleep\nof tired men.\n\nNo sound disturbed Rodriguez or Morano till both awoke in late morning\nupon the rocks of the mountain. The sun had climbed over the crags and\nnow shone on their faces. Rodriguez was still lying with his sword\ngripped in his hand, but the cross had fallen by Morano and now lay on\nthe rocks beside him with the handle of the frying-pan still tied in\nits place by string. A young, wild, woodland squirrel gambolled near,\nthough there were no woods for it anywhere within sight: it leaped and\nplayed as though rejoicing in youth, with such merriment as though\nyouth had but come to it newly or been lost and restored again.\n\nAll over the mountain they looked but there was no house, nor any sign\nof dwelling of man or spirit.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIFTH CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE RODE IN THE TWILIGHT AND SAW SERAFINA\n\n\nRodriguez, who loved philosophy, turned his mind at once to the journey\nthat lay before him, deciding which was the north; for he knew that it\nwas by the north that he must leave Spain, which he still desired to\nleave since there were no wars in that country.\n\nMorano knew not clearly what philosophy was, yet he wasted no thoughts\nupon the night that was gone; and, fitting up his frying-pan\nimmediately, he brought out what was left of his bacon and began to\nlook for material to make a fire. The bacon lay waiting in the\nfrying-pan for some while before this material was gathered, for\nnothing grew on the mountain but a heath; and of that there were few\nbushes, scattered here and there.\n\nRodriguez, far from ruminating upon the events of the previous night,\nrealised as he watched these preparations that he was enormously\nhungry. And when Morano had kindled a fire and the smell of cooking\narose, he who had held the chair of magic at Saragossa was banished\nfrom both their minds, although upon this very spot they had spent so\nstrange a night; but where bacon is, and there be hungry men, the\nthings of yesterday are often forgotten.\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez, \"we must walk far to-day.\"\n\n\"Indeed, master,\" said Morano, \"we must push on to these wars; for you\nhave no castle, master, no lands, no fortune ...\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Rodriguez.\n\nMorano slung his frying-pan behind him: they had eaten up the last of\nhis bacon: he stood up, and they were ready for the journey. The smoke\nfrom their meagre fire went thinly into the air, the small grey clouds\nof it went slowly up: nothing beside remained to bid them farewell, or\nfor them to thank for their strange night's hospitality. They climbed\ntill they reached the rugged crest of the mountain; thence they saw a\nwide plain and the morning: the day was waiting for them.\n\nThe northern slope of the mountain was wholly different from that black\ncongregation of angry rocks through which they had climbed by night to\nthe House of Wonder.\n\nThe slope that now lay before them was smooth and grassy, flowing\nbefore them far, a gentle slope that was soon to lend speed to\nRodriguez' feet, adding nimbleness even to youth. Soon, too, it was to\nlift onward the dull weight of Morano as he followed his master towards\nunknown wars, youth going before him like a spirit and the good slope\nhelping behind. But before they gave themselves to that waiting journey\nthey stood a moment and looked at the shining plain that lay before\nthem like an open page, on which was the whole chronicle of that day's\nwayfaring. There was the road they should travel by, there were the\nstreams it crossed and narrow woods they might rest in, and dim on the\nfarthest edge was the place they must spend that night. It was all, as\nit were written, upon the plain they watched, but in a writing not\nintended for them, and, clear although it be, never to be interpreted\nby one of our race. Thus they saw clear, from a height, the road they\nwould go by, but not one of all the events to which it would lead them.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"shall we have more adventures to-day?\"\n\n\"I trust so,\" said Rodriguez. \"We have far to go, and it will be dull\njourneying without them.\"\n\nMorano turned his eyes from his master's face and looked back to the\nplain. \"There, master,\" he said, \"where our road runs through a wood,\nwill our adventure be there, think you? Or there, perhaps,\" and he\nwaved his hand widely farther.\n\n\"No,\" said Rodriguez, \"we pass that in bright daylight.\"\n\n\"Is that not good for adventure?\" said Morano.\n\n\"The romances teach,\" said Rodriguez, \"that twilight or night are\nbetter. The shade of deep woods is favourable, but there are no such\nwoods on this plain. When we come to evening we shall doubtless meet\nsome adventure, far over there.\" And he pointed to the grey rim of the\nplain where it started climbing towards hills.\n\n\"These are good days,\" said Morano. He forgot how short a time ago he\nhad said regretfully that these days were not as the old days. But our\nrace, speaking generally, is rarely satisfied with the present, and\nMorano's cheerfulness had not come from his having risen suddenly\nsuperior to this everyday trouble of ours; it came from his having\nshifted his gaze to the future. Two things are highly tolerable to us,\nand even alluring, the past and the future. It was only with the\npresent that Morano was ever dissatisfied.\n\nWhen Morano said that the days were good Rodriguez set out to find\nthem, or at least that one that for some while now lay waiting for them\non the plain. He strode down the slope at once and, endowing nature\nwith his own impatience, he felt that he heard the morning call to him\nwistfully. Morano followed.\n\nFor an hour these refugees escaping from peace went down the slope; and\nin that hour they did five swift miles, miles that seemed to run by\nthem as they walked, and so they came lightly to the level plain. And\nin the next hour they did four miles more. Words were few, either\nbecause Morano brooded mainly upon one thought, the theme of which was\nhis lack of bacon, or because he kept his breath to follow his master\nwho, with youth and the morning, was coming out of the hills at a pace\nnot tuned to Morano's forty years or so. And at the end of these nine\nmiles Morano perceived a house, a little way from the road, on the\nleft, upon rising ground. A mile or so ahead they saw the narrow wood\nthat they had viewed in the morning from the mountain running across\nthe plain. They saw now by the lie of the ground that it probably\nfollowed a stream, a pleasant place in which to take the rest demanded\nby Spain at noon. It was just an hour to noon; so Rodriguez, keeping\nthe road, told Morano to join him where it entered the wood when he had\nacquired his bacon. And then as they parted a thought occurred to\nRodriguez, which was that bacon cost money. It was purely an\nafterthought, an accidental fancy, such as inspirations are, for he had\nnever had to buy bacon. So he gave Morano a fifth part of his money, a\nlarge gold coin the size of one of our five-shilling pieces, engraved\nof course upon one side with the glories and honours of that golden\nperiod of Spain, and upon the other with the head of the lord the King.\nIt was only by chance he had brought any at all; he was not what our\nnewspapers will call, if they ever care to notice him, a level-headed\nbusiness man. At the sight of the gold piece Morano bowed, for he felt\nthis gift of gold to be an occasion; but he trusted more for the\npurchase of the bacon to some few small silver coins of his own that he\nkept among lumps of lard and pieces of string.\n\nAnd so they parted for a while, Rodriguez looking for some great\nshadowy oak with moss under it near a stream, Morano in quest of bacon.\n\nWhen Rodriguez entered the wood he found his oak, but it was not such\nan oak as he cared to rest beneath during the heat of the day, nor\nwould you have done so, my reader, even though you have been to the\nwars and seen many a pretty mess; for four of la Garda were by it and\nwere arranging to hang a man from the best of the branches.\n\n\"La Garda again,\" said Rodriguez nearly aloud.\n\nHis eye drooped, his look was listless, he gazed at other things; while\na glance that you had not noticed, flashed slantingly at la Garda,\nsatisfied Rodriguez that all four were strangers: then he walked\nstraight towards them merrily. The man they proposed to hang was a\nstranger too. He appeared at first to be as stout as Morano, and he was\nnearly half a foot taller, but his stoutness turned out to be sheer\nmuscle. The broad man was clothed in old brown leather and had blue\neyes.\n\nNow there was something about the poise of Rodriguez' young head which\ngave him an air not unlike that which the King himself sometimes wore\nwhen he went courting. It suited his noble sword and his merry plume.\nWhen la Garda saw him they were all politeness at once, and invited him\nto see the hanging, for which Rodriguez thanked them with amplest\ncourtesy.\n\n\"It is not a bull-fight,\" said the chief of la Garda almost\napologetically. But Rodriguez waved aside his deprecations and declared\nhimself charmed at the prospect of a hanging.\n\nBear with me, reader, while I champion a bad cause and seek to palliate\nwhat is inexcusable. As we travel about the world on our way through\nlife we meet and pass here and there, in peace or in war, other men,\nfellow-travellers: and sometimes there is no more than time for a\nglance, eye to eye. And in that glance you see the sort of man: and\nchiefly there are two sorts. The one sort always brooding, always\nplanning; mean, silent men, collecting properties and money; keeping\nthe law on their side, keeping everything on their side; except women\nand heaven, and the late, leisurely judgment of simple people: and the\nothers merry folk, whose eyes twinkle, whose money flies, who will\nsooner laugh than plan, who seem to inherit rightfully the happiness\nthat the others plot for, and fail to come by with all their schemes.\nIn the man who was to provide the entertainment Rodriguez recognised\nthe second kind.\n\nNow even though the law had caught a saint that had strayed too far\noutside the boundary of Heaven, and desired to hang him, Rodriguez knew\nthat it was his duty to help the law while help was needed, and to\napplaud after the thing was done. The law to Rodriguez was the most\nsacred thing man had made, if indeed it were not divine; but since the\nprivilege that two days ago had afforded him of studying it more\nclosely, it appeared to him the blindest, silliest thing with which he\nhad had to do since the kittens were drowned that his cat Tabitharina\nhad had at Arguento Harez.\n\nIt was in this deplorable state of mind that Rodriguez' glance fell on\nthe merry eyes and the solemn predicament of the man in the leather\ncoat, standing pinioned under a long branch of the oak-tree: and he\ndetermined from that moment to disappoint la Garda and, I fear also, my\nreader, perhaps to disappoint you, of the hanging that they at least\nhad promised themselves.\n\n\"Think you,\" said Rodriguez, \"that for so stout a knave this branch of\nyours suffices?\"\n\nNow it was an excellent branch. But it was not so much Rodriguez' words\nas the anxious way in which he looked at the branch that aroused the\nanxieties of la Garda: and soon they were looking about to find a\nbetter tree; and when four men start doing this in a wood time quickly\npasses. Meanwhile Morano drew near, and Rodriguez went to meet him.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, all out of breath, \"they had no bacon. But I got\nthese two bottles of wine. It is strong wine, which is a rare deluder\nof the senses, which will need to be deluded if we are to go hungry.\"\n\nRodriguez was about to cut short Morano's chatter when he thought of a\nuse for the wine, and was silent a moment. And as he pondered Morano\nlooked up and saw la Garda and at the same time perceived the\nsituation, for he had as quick an eye for a bad business as any man.\n\n\"No one with the horses,\" was his comment; for they were tethered a\nlittle apart. But Rodriguez' mind had already explored a surer method\nthan the one that Morano seemed to be contemplating. This method he\ntold Morano. And now, from little tugs that they were giving to the\ndoubled rope that hung over the branch of the oak-tree, it was clear\nenough that the men of the law were returning to their confidence in\nthat very sufficient branch.\n\nThey looked up with questions ripe to drop from their lips when they\nsaw Rodriguez returning with Morano. But before one of them spoke\nMorano flung to them from far off a little piece of his wisdom: for\ncast a truth into an occasion and it will always trouble the waters,\nusually stirring up contradiction, but always bringing something to the\nsurface.\n\n\"Se\u00f1ores,\" he said, \"no man can enjoy a hanging with a dry throat.\"\n\nThus he turned their attention a while from the business in hand,\nchanging their thoughts from the stout neck of the prisoner to their\nown throats, wondering were they dry; and you do not wonder long about\nthis in the south without finding that what you feared is true. And\nthen he let them see the two great bottles, all full of wine, for the\ninvention of the false bottom that gives to our champagne-bottles the\nplace they rightly hold among famous deceptions had not as yet been\ndiscovered.\n\n\"It is true,\" said la Garda. And Rodriguez made Morano put one of the\nbottles away in a piece of a sack that he carried: and when la Garda\nsaw one of the two bottles disappear it somehow decided them to have\nthe other, though how this came to be so there is no saying; and thus\nthe hanging was postponed again.\n\nNow the drink was a yellow wine, sweet and heavy and stronger than our\nport; only our whisky could out-triumph it, but there in the warm south\nit answered its purpose. Rodriguez beckoned Morano up and offered the\nbottle to one of la Garda; but scarcely had he put it to his lips when\nRodriguez bade him stop, saying that he had had his share. And he did\nthe same with the next man.\n\nNow there be few things indeed which la Garda resent more than meagre\nhospitality in the matter of drink, and with all their wits striving to\ncope with this vicious defect in Rodriguez, as they rightly or wrongly\nregarded it, how should they have any to spare for obvious precautions?\nAs the third man drank, Rodriguez turned to speak to Morano; and the\nrepresentative of the law took such advantage of an opportunity that he\nfeared to be fleeting, that when Rodriguez turned round again the\nbottle was just half empty. Rodriguez had timed it very nicely.\n\nNext Rodriguez put the bottle to his lips and held it there a little\ntime, while the fourth man of the law, who was guarding the prisoner,\nwatched Rodriguez wistfully, and afterwards Morano, who took the bottle\nnext. Yet neither Rodriguez nor Morano drank.\n\n\"You can finish the bottle,\" said Rodriguez to this anxious watcher,\nwho came forward eagerly though full of doubts, which changed to warm\nfeelings of exuberant gratitude when he found how much remained. Thus\nhe obtained not much less than two tumblerfuls of wine that, as I have\nsaid, was stronger than port; and noon was nearing and it was spring in\nSpain. And then he returned to guard his prisoner under the oak-tree\nand lay down there on the moss, remembering that it was his duty to\nkeep awake. And afterwards with one hand he took hold of a rope that\nbound the prisoner's ankles, so that he might still guard his prisoner\neven though he should fall asleep.\n\nNow two of the men had had little more than the full of a sherry glass\neach. To these Morano made signs that there was another bottle, and,\ncoming round behind his master, he covertly uncorked it and gave them\ntheir heart's desire; and a little was left over for the man who drank\nthird on the first occasion. And presently the spirits of all four of\nla Garda grew haughty and forgot their humble bodies, and would fain\nhave gone forth to dwell with the sons of light, while their bodies lay\non the moss and the sun grew warmer and warmer, shining dappled in\namongst the small green leaves. All seemed still but for the winged\ninsects flashing through shafts of the sunlight out of the gloom of the\ntrees and disappearing again like infinitesimal meteors. But our\nconcern is with the thoughts of man, of which deeds are but the\nshadows: wherever these are active it is wrong to say all is still; for\nwhether they cast their shadows, which are actions, or whether they\nremain a force not visibly stirring matter, they are the source of the\ntales we write and the lives we lead; it is they that gave History her\nmaterial and they that bade her work it up into books.\n\nAnd thoughts were very active about that oak-tree. For while the\nthoughts of la Garda arose like dawn, and disappeared into mists, their\nprisoner was silently living through the sunny days of his life, which\nare at no time quite lost to us, and which flash vivid and bright and\nnear when memory touches them, herself awakened by the nearness of\ndeath. He lived again days far from the day that had brought him where\nhe stood. He drew from those days (that is to say) that delight, that\nessence of hours, that something which we call life. The sun, the wind,\nthe rough sand, the splash of the sea, on the star-fish, and all the\nthings that it feels during its span, are stored in something like its\nmemory, and are what we call its life: it is the same with all of us.\nLife is feeling. The prisoner from the store of his memory was taking\nall he had. His head was lifted, he was gazing northwards, far further\nthan his eyes could see, to shining spaces in great woods; and there\nhis threatened being walked in youth, with steps such as spirits take,\nover immortal flowers, which were dim and faint but unfading because\nthey lived on in memory. In memory he walked with some who were now far\nfrom his footsteps. And, seen through the gloaming of that perilous\nday, how bright did those far days appear! Did they not seem sunnier\nthan they really were? No, reader; for all the radiance that glittered\nso late in his mind was drawn from those very days; it was their own\nbrightness that was shining now: we are not done with the days that\nwere as soon as their sunsets have faded, but a light remains from them\nand grows fairer and fairer, like an afterglow lingering among\ntremendous peaks above immeasurable slopes of snow.\n\nThe prisoner had scarcely noticed Rodriguez or his servant, any more\nthan he noticed his captors; for there come an intensity to those who\nwalk near death that makes them a little alien from other men, life\nflaring up in them at the last into so grand a flame that the lives of\nthe others seem a little cold and dim where they dwell remote from that\nsunset that we call mortality. So he looked silently at the days that\nwere as they came dancing back again to him from where they had long\nlain lost in chasms of time, to which they had slipped over dark edges\nof years. Smiling they came, but all wistfully anxious, as though their\nerrand were paramount and their span short: he saw them cluster about\nhim, running now, bringing their tiny gifts, and scarcely heard the\nheavy sigh of his guard as Rodriguez gagged him and Morano tied him up.\n\nHad Rodriguez now released the prisoner they could have been three to\nthree, in the event of things going wrong with the sleep of la Garda;\nbut, since in the same time they could gag and bind another, the odds\nwould be the same at two to two, and Rodriguez preferred this to the\nslight uncertainties that would be connected with the entry of another\npartner. They accordingly gagged the next man and bound his wrists and\nankles. And that Spanish wine held good with the other two and bound\nthem far down among the deeps of dreams: and so it should, for it was\nof a vine that grew in the vales of Spain and had ripened in one of the\nyears of the golden age.\n\nThey bound one as easily as they had bound the other two; and the last\nRodriguez watched while Morano cut the ropes off the prisoner, for he\nhad run out of bits of twine and all other improvisations. With these\nropes he ran back to his master, and they tied up the last prisoner but\ndid not gag him.\n\n\"Shall we gag him, master, like the rest?\" said Morano.\n\n\"No,\" said Rodriguez. \"He has nothing to say.\"\n\nAnd though this remark turned out to be strictly untrue, it well enough\nanswered its purpose.\n\nAnd then they saw standing before them the man they had freed. And he\nbowed to Rodriguez like one that had never bowed before. I do not mean\nthat he bowed with awkwardness, like imitative men unused to\npoliteness, but he bowed as the oak bows to the woodman; he stood\nstraight, looking Rodriguez in the eyes, then he bowed as though he had\nlet his spirit break, which allowed him to bow to never a man before.\nThus, if my pen has been able dimly to tell of it, thus bowed the man\nin the old leathern jacket. And Rodriguez bowed to him in answer with\nthe elegance that they that had dwelt at Arguento Harez had slowly\ndrawn from the ages.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or, your name,\" said the stranger.\n\n\"Lord of Arguento Harez,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" he said, \"being a busy man, I have seldom time to pray. And\nthe blessed Saints, being more busy than I, I think seldom hear my\nprayers: yet your name shall go up to them. I will often tell it them\nquietly in the forest, and not on their holy days when bells are\nringing and loud prayers fill Heaven. It may be ...\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" Rodriguez said, \"I profoundly thank you.\"\n\nEven in these days, when bullets are often thicker than prayers, we are\nnot quite thankless for the prayers of others: in those days they were\nwhat \"closing quotations\" are on the Stock Exchange, ink in Fleet\nStreet, machinery in the Midlands; common but valued; and Rodriguez'\nthanks were sincere.\n\nAnd now that the curses of the ungagged one of la Garda were growing\nmonotonous, Rodriguez turned to Morano.\n\n\"Ungag the rest,\" he said, \"and let them talk to each other.\"\n\n\"Master,\" Morano muttered, feeling that there was enough noise already\nfor a small wood, but he went and did as he was ordered. And Rodriguez\nwas justified of his humane decision, for the pent thoughts of all\nthree found expression together and, all four now talking at once,\nmitigated any bitterness there may have been in those solitary curses.\nAnd now Rodriguez could talk undisturbed.\n\n\"Whither?\" said the stranger.\n\n\"To the wars,\" said Rodriguez, \"if wars there be.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said the stranger, \"there be always wars somewhere. By which\nroad go you?\"\n\n\"North,\" said Rodriguez, and he pointed. The stranger turned his eyes\nto the way Rodriguez pointed.\n\n\"That brings you to the forest,\" he said, \"unless you go far around, as\nmany do.\"\n\n\"What forest?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"The great forest named Shadow Valley,\" said the stranger.\n\n\"How far?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Forty miles,\" said the stranger.\n\nRodriguez looked at la Garda and then at their horses, and thought. He\nmust be far from la Garda by nightfall.\n\n\"It is not easy to pass through Shadow Valley,\" said the stranger.\n\n\"Is it not?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Have you a gold great piece?\" the stranger said.\n\nRodriguez held out one of his remaining four: the stranger took it. And\nthen he began to rub it on a stone, and continued to rub while\nRodriguez watched in silence, until the image of the lord the King was\ngone and the face of the coin was scratchy and shiny and flat. And then\nhe produced from a pocket or pouch in his jacket a graving tool with a\nround wooden handle, which he took in the palm of his hand, and the\nedge of the steel came out between his forefinger and thumb: and with\nthis he cut at the coin. And Morano rejoined them from his merciful\nmission and stood and wondered at the cutting. And while he cut they\ntalked.\n\nThey did not ask him how he came to be chosen for hanging, because in\nevery country there are about a hundred individualists, varying to\nperhaps half a hundred in poor ages. They go their hundred ways, or\ntheir half-dozen ways; and there is a hundred and first way, or a\nseventh way, which is the way that is cut for the rest: and if some of\nthe rest catch one of the hundred, or one of the six, they naturally\nhang him, if they have a rope, and if hanging is the custom of the\ncountry, for different countries use different methods. And you saw by\nthis man's eyes that he was one of the hundred. Rodriguez therefore\nonly sought to know how he came to be caught.\n\n\"La Garda found you, se\u00f1or?\" he said.\n\n\"As you see,\" said the stranger. \"I came too far from my home.\"\n\n\"You were travelling?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Shopping,\" he said.\n\nAt this word Morano's interest awakened wide. \"Se\u00f1or,\" he said, \"what\nis the right price for a bottle of this wine that la Garda drink?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said the man in the brown jacket; \"they give me these\nthings.\"\n\n\"Where is your home, se\u00f1or?\" Rodriguez asked.\n\n\"It is Shadow Valley,\" he said.\n\nOne never saw Rodriguez fail to understand anything: if he could not\nclear a situation up he did not struggle with it. Morano rubbed his\nchin: he had heard of Shadow Valley only dimly, for all the travellers\nhe had known out of the north had gone round it. Rodriguez and Morano\nbent their heads and watched a design that was growing out of the gold.\nAnd as the design grew under the hand of the strange worker he began to\ntalk of the horses. He spoke as though his plans had been clearly\nestablished by edict, and as though no others could be.\n\n\"When I have gone with two horses,\" he said, \"ride hard with the other\ntwo till you reach the village named Lowlight, and take them to the\nforge of Fernandez the smith, where one will shoe them who is not\nFernandez.\"\n\nAnd he waved his hand northwards. There was only one road. Then all his\nattention fell back again to his work on the gold coin; and when those\nblue eyes were turned away there seemed nothing left to question. And\nnow Rodriguez saw the design was a crown, a plain gold circlet with oak\nleaves rising up from it. And this woodland emblem stood up out of the\ngold, for the worker had hollowed the coin away all around it, and was\nsloping it up to the edge. Little was said by the watchers in the\nwonder of seeing the work, for no craft is very far from the line\nbeyond which is magic, and the man in the leather coat was clearly a\ncraftsman: and he said nothing for he worked at a craft. And when the\narboreal crown was finished, and its edges were straight and sharp, an\nhour had passed since he began near noon. Then he drilled a hole near\nthe rim and, drawing a thin green ribbon from his pocket, he passed it\nthrough the hole and, rising, he suddenly hung it round Rodriguez' neck.\n\n\"Wear it thus,\" he said, \"while you go through Shadow Valley.\"\n\nAs he said this he stepped back among the trees, and Rodriguez followed\nto thank him. Not finding him behind the tree where he thought to find\nhim, he walked round several others, and Morano joined his search; but\nthe stranger had vanished. When they returned again to the little\nclearing they heard sounds of movement in the wood, and a little way\noff where the four horses had grazed there were now only two, which\nwere standing there with their heads up.\n\n\"We must ride, Morano,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Ride, master?\" said Morano dolefully.\n\n\"If we walk away,\" said Rodriguez, \"they will walk after us.\"\n\n\"They\" meant la Garda. It was unnecessary for him to tell Morano what I\nthus tell the reader, for in the wood it was hard to hear anyone else,\nwhile to think of anyone else was out of the question.\n\n\"What shall I do to them, master?\" said Morano.\n\nThey were now standing close to their captives and this simple question\ncalmed the four men's curses, all of a sudden, like shutting the door\non a storm.\n\n\"Leave them,\" Rodriguez said. And la Garda's spirits rose and they\ncursed again.\n\n\"Ah. To die in the wood,\" said Morano. \"No,\" said Rodriguez; and he\nwalked towards the horses. And something in that \"No\" sounding almost\ncontemptuous, Morano's feelings were hurt, and he blurted out to his\nmaster \"But how can they get away to get their food? It is good knots\nthat I tie, master.\"\n\n\"Morano,\" Rodriguez said, \"I remember ten ways in the books of romance\nwhereby bound men untie themselves; and doubtless one or two more I\nhave read and forgot; and there may be other ways in the books that I\nhave not read, besides any way that there be of which no books tell.\nAnd in addition to these ways, one of them may draw a comrade's sword\nwith his teeth and thus ...\"\n\n\"Shall I pull out their teeth?\" said Morano.\n\n\"Ride,\" said Rodriguez, for they were now come to the horses. And\nsorrowfully Morano looked at the horse that was to be his, as a man\nmight look at a small, uncomfortable boat that is to carry him far upon\na stormy day. And then Rodriguez helped him into the saddle.\n\n\"Can you stay there?\" Rodriguez said. \"We have far to go.\"\n\n\"Master,\" Morano answered, \"these hands can hold till evening.\"\n\nAnd then Rodriguez mounted, leaving Morano gripping the high front of\nthe saddle with his large brown hands. But as soon as the horses\nstarted he got a grip with his heels as well, and later on with his\nknees. Rodriguez led the way on to the straggling road and was soon\ngalloping northwards, while Morano's heels kept his horse up close to\nhis master's. Morano rode as though trained in the same school that\nsome while later taught Macaulay's equestrian, who rode with \"loose\nrein and bloody spur.\" Yet the miles went swiftly by as they galloped\non soft white dust, which lifted and settled, some of it, back on the\nlazy road, while some of it was breathed by Morano. The gold coin on\nthe green silk ribbon flapped up and down as Rodriguez rode, till he\nstuffed it inside his clothing and remembered no more about it. Once\nthey saw before them the man they had snatched from the noose: he was\ngoing hard and leading a loose horse. And then where the road bent\nround a low hill he galloped out of sight and they saw him no more. He\nhad the loose horse to change on to as soon as the other was tired:\nthey had no prospect of overtaking him. And so he passed out of their\nminds as their host had done who went away with his household to\nSaragossa.\n\nAt first Rodriguez' mandolin, that was always slung on his back, bumped\nup and down uncomfortably; but he eased it by altering the strap: small\nthings like this bring contentment. And then he settled down to ride.\nBut no contentment came near Morano nor did he look for it. On the\nfirst day of his wanderings he had worn his master's clothes, which has\nbeen an experience standing somewhat where toothache does, which is\nsomewhere about half-way between discomfort and agony. On the second\nday he had climbed at the end of a weary journey over those sharp rocks\nwhose shape was adapted so ill to his body. On the third day he was\nriding. He did not look for comfort. But he met discomfort with an easy\nresignation that almost defeated the intention of Satan who sends it,\nunless--as is very likely--it be from Heaven. And in spite of all\ndiscomforts he gaily followed Rodriguez. In a thousand days at the Inn\nof the Dragon and Knight no two were so different to Morano that one\nstood out from the other, or any from the rest. It was all as though\none day were repeated again and again; and at some point in this\nmonotonous repetition, like a milestone shaped as the rest on a\nperfectly featureless road, life would end and the meaningless\nrepetition stop: and looking back on it there would only be one day to\nsee, or, if he could not look back, it would be all gone for nothing.\nAnd then, into that one day that he was living on in the gloaming of\nthat grim inn, Rodriguez had appeared, and Morano had known him for one\nof those wandering lights that sometimes make sudden day among the\nstars. He knew--no, he felt--that by following him, yesterday today and\ntomorrow would be three separate possessions in memory. Morano gladly\ngave up that one dull day he was living for the new strange days\nthrough which Rodriguez was sure to lead him. Gladly he left it: if\nthis be not true how then has a man with a dream led thousands to\nfollow his fancy, from the Crusades to whatever gay madness be the\nfashion when this is read? As they galloped the scent of the flowers\nrushed into Rodriguez' nostrils, while Morano mainly breathed the dust\nfrom the hooves of his master's horse. But the quest was favoured the\nmore by the scent of the flowers inspiring its leader's fancies. So\nMorano gained even from this.\n\nIn the first hour they shortened by fifteen miles the length of their\nrambling quest. In the next hour they did five miles; and in the third\nhour ten. After this they rode slowly. The sun was setting. Morano\nregarded the sunset with delight, for it seemed to promise jovially the\nend of his sufferings, which except for brief periods when they went on\nfoot, to rest--as Rodriguez said--the horses, had been continuous and\neven increasing since they started. Rodriguez, perhaps a little weary\ntoo, drew from the sunset a more sombre feeling, as sensitive minds do:\nhe responded to its farewell, he felt its beauty, and as little winds\nturned cool and the shine of blades of grass faded, making all the\nplain dimmer, he heard, or believed he heard, further off than he could\nsee, sounds on the plain beyond ridges, in hollows, behind clumps of\nbushes; as though small creatures all unknown to his learning played\ninstruments cut from reeds upon unmapped streams. In this hour, among\nthese fancies, Rodriguez saw clear on a hill the white walls of the\nvillage of Lowlight. And now they began to notice that a great round\nmoon was shining. The sunset grew dimmer and the moonlight stole in\nsoftly, as a cat might walk through great doors on her silent feet into\na throne-room just as the king had gone: and they entered the village\nslowly in the perfect moment of twilight.\n\nThe round horizon was brimming with a pale but magical colour, welling\nup to the tips of trees and the battlements of white towers. Earth\nseemed a mysterious cup overfull of this pigment of wonder. Clouds\nwandering low, straying far from their azure fields, were dipped in it.\nThe towers of Lowlight turned slowly rose in that light, and glowed\ntogether with the infinite gloaming, so that for this brief hour the\nthings of man were wed with the things of eternity. It was into this\nwide, pale flame of aetherial rose that the moon came stealing like a\nmagician on tip-toe, to enchant the tips of the trees, low clouds and\nthe towers of Lowlight. A blue light from beyond our world touched the\npink that is Earth's at evening: and what was strange and a matter for\nhushed voices, marvellous but yet of our earth, became at that touch\nunearthly. All in a moment it was, and Rodriguez gasped to see it. Even\nMorano's eyes grew round with the coming of wonder, or with some dim\nfeeling that an unnoticed moment had made all things strange and new.\n\nFor some moments the spell of moonlight on sunlight hovered: the air\nwas brimming and quivering with it: magic touched earth. For some\nmoments, some thirty beats of a heron's wing, had the angels sung to\nmen, had their songs gone earthward into that rosy glow, gliding past\nlayers of faintly tinted cloud, like moths at dusk towards a\nbriar-rose; in those few moments men would have known their language.\nRodriguez reined in his horse in the heavy silence and waited. For what\nhe waited he knew not: some unearthly answer perhaps to his questioning\nthoughts that had wandered far from earth, though no words came to him\nwith which to ask their question and he did not know what question they\nwould ask. He was all vibrating with the human longing: I know not what\nit is, but perhaps philosophers know. He sat there waiting while a late\nbird sailed homeward, sat while Morano wondered. And nothing spake from\nanywhere.\n\nAnd now a dog began to notice the moon: now a child cried suddenly that\nhad been dragged back from the street, where it had wandered at\nbedtime: an old dog rose from where it had lain in the sun and feebly\nyet confidently scratched at a door: a cat peered round a corner: a man\nspoke: Rodriguez knew there would be no answer now.\n\nRodriguez hit his horse, the tired animal went forward, and he and\nMorano rode slowly up the street.\n\nDona Serafina of the Valley of Dawnlight had left the heat of the room\nthat looked on the fields, and into which the sun had all day been\nstreaming, and had gone at sunset to sit in the balcony that looked\nalong the street. Often she would do this at sunset; but she rather\ndreamed as she sat there than watched the street, for all that it had\nto show she knew without glancing. Evening after evening as soon as\nwinter was over the neighbour would come from next door and stretch\nhimself and yawn and sit on a chair by his doorway, and the neighbour\nfrom opposite would saunter across the way to him, and they would talk\nwith eagerness of the sale of cattle, and sometimes, but more coldly,\nof the affairs of kings. She knew, but cared not to know, just when the\ntwo old men would begin their talk. She knew who owned every dog that\nstretched itself in the dust until chilly winds blew in the dusk and\nthey rose up dissatisfied. She knew the affairs of that street like an\nold, old lesson taught drearily, and her thoughts went far away to\nvales of an imagination where they met with many another maiden fancy,\nand they all danced there together through the long twilight in Spring.\nAnd then her mother would come and warn her that the evening grew cold,\nand Serafina would turn from the mystery of evening into the house and\nthe candle-light. This was so evening after evening all through spring\nand summer for two long years of her youth. And then, this evening,\njust as the two old neighbours began to discuss whether or not the\nsubjugation of the entire world by Spain would be for its benefit, just\nas one of the dogs in the road was rising slowly to shake itself,\nneighbours and dogs all raised their heads to look, and there was\nRodriguez riding down the street and Morano coming behind him. When\nSerafina saw this she brought her eyes back from dreams, for she\ndreamed not so deeply but that the cloak and plume of Rodriguez found\nsome place upon the boundaries of her day-dream. When she saw the way\nhe sat his horse and how he carried his head she let her eyes flash for\na little moment along the street from her balcony. And if some critical\nreader ask how she did it I answer, \"My good sir, I can't tell you,\nbecause I don't know,\" or \"My dear lady, what a question to ask!\" And\nwhere she learned to do it I cannot think, but nothing was easier. And\nthen she smiled to think that she had done the very thing that her\nmother had warned her there was danger in doing.\n\n\"Serafina,\" her mother said in that moment at the large window, \"the\nevening grows cold. It might be dangerous to stay there longer.\" And\nSerafina entered the house, as she had done at the coming of dusk on\nmany an evening.\n\nRodriguez missed as much of that flash of her eyes, shot from below the\ndarkness of her hair, as youth in its first glory and freedom misses.\nFor at the point on the road called life at which Rodriguez was then,\none is high on a crag above the promontories of watchmen, lower only\nthan the peaks of the prophets, from which to see such things. Yet it\ndid not need youth to notice Serafina. Beggars had blessed her for the\npoise of her head.\n\nShe turned that head a little as she went between the windows, till\nRodriguez gazing up to her saw the fair shape of her neck: and almost\nin that moment the last of the daylight died. The windows shut; and\nRodriguez rode on with Morano to find the forge that was kept by\nFernandez the smith. And presently they came to the village forge, a\ncottage with huge, high roof whose beams were safe from sparks; and its\nfire was glowing redly into the moonlight through the wide door made\nfor horses, although there seemed no work to be done, and a man with a\nswart moustache was piling more logs on. Over the door was burned on\noak in ungainly great letters--\n\n\"FERNANDEZ\"\n\n\"For whom do you seek, se\u00f1or?\" he said to Rodriguez, who had halted\nbefore him with his horse's nose inside the doorway sniffing.\n\n\"I look,\" he said, \"for him who is not Fernandez.\"\n\n\"I am he,\" said the man by the fire.\n\nRodriguez questioned no further but dismounted, and bade Morano lead\nthe horses in. And then he saw in the dark at the back of the forge the\nother two horses that he had seen in the wood. And they were shod as he\nhad never seen horses shod before. For the front pair of shoes were\njoined by a chain riveted stoutly to each, and the hind pair also; and\nboth horses were shod alike. The method was equally new to Morano. And\nnow the man with the swart moustache picked up another bunch of\nhorseshoes hanging in pairs on chains. And Rodriguez was not far out\nwhen he guessed that whenever la Garda overtook their horses they would\nfind that Fernandez was far away making holiday, while he who shod them\nnow would be gone upon other business. And all this work seemed to\nRodriguez not to be his affair.\n\n\"Farewell,\" he said to the smith that was not Fernandez; and with a pat\nfor his horse he left it, having obtained a promise of oats. And so\nRodriguez and Morano went on foot again, Morano elated in spite of\nfatigue and pain, rejoicing to feel the earth once more, flat under the\nsoles of his feet; Rodriguez a little humbled.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIXTH CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE SANG TO HIS MANDOLIN AND WHAT CAME OF HIS SINGING\n\n\nThey walked back slowly in silence up the street down which they had\nridden. Earth darkened, the moon grew brighter: and Rodriguez gazing at\nthe pale golden disk began to wonder who dwelt in the lunar valleys;\nand what message, if folk were there, they had for our peoples; and in\nwhat language such message could ever be, and how it could fare across\nthat limpid remoteness that wafted light on to the coasts of Earth and\nlapped in silence on the lunar shores. And as he wondered he thought of\nhis mandolin.\n\n\"Morano,\" he said, \"buy bacon.\"\n\nMorano's eyes brightened: they were forty-five miles from the hills on\nwhich he had last tasted bacon. He selected his house with a glance,\nand then he was gone. And Rodriguez reflected too late that he had\nforgotten to tell Morano where he should find him, and this with night\ncoming on in a strange village. Scarcely, Rodriguez reflected, he knew\nwhere he was going himself. Yet if old tunes lurking in its hollows,\nechoing though imperceptibly from long-faded evenings, gave the\nmandolin any knowledge of human affairs that other inanimate things\ncannot possess, the mandolin knew.\n\nLet us in fancy call up the shade of Morano from that far generation.\nLet us ask him where Rodriguez is going. Those blue eyes, dim with the\ndistance over which our fancy has called them, look in our eyes with\nwonder.\n\n\"I do not know,\" he says, \"where Don Rodriguez is going. My master did\nnot tell me.\"\n\nDid he notice nothing as they rode by that balcony?\n\n\"Nothing,\" Morano answers, \"except my master riding.\"\n\nWe may let Morano's shade drift hence again, for we shall discover\nnothing: nor is this an age to which to call back spirits.\n\nRodriguez strolled slowly on the deep dust of that street as though\nwondering all the while where he should go; and soon he and his\nmandolin were below that very balcony whereon he had seen the white\nneck of Serafina gleam with the last of the daylight. And now the\nspells of the moon charmed Earth with their full power.\n\nThe balcony was empty. How should it have been otherwise? And yet\nRodriguez grieved. For between the vision that had drawn his footsteps\nand that bare balcony below shuttered windows was the difference\nbetween a haven, sought over leagues of sea, and sheer, uncharted\ncliff. It brought a wistfulness into the music he played, and a\nmelancholy that was all new to Rodriguez, yet often and often before\nhad that mandolin sent up through evening against unheeding Space that\ncry that man cannot utter; for the spirit of man needs a mandolin as a\ncomrade to face the verdict of the chilly stars as he needs a bulldog\nfor more mundane things.\n\nSoon out of the depth of that stout old mandolin, in which so many\nhuman sorrows had spun tunes out of themselves, as the spiders spin\nmisty grey webs, till it was all haunted with music, soon the old cry\nwent up to the stars again, a thread of supplication spun of the matter\nwhich else were distilled in tears, beseeching it knew not what. And,\nbut that Fate is deaf, all that man asks in music had been granted then.\n\nWhat sorrows had Rodriguez known in his life that he made so sad a\nmelody? I know not. It was the mandolin. When the mandolin was made it\nknew at once all the sorrows of man, and all the old unnamed longings\nthat none defines. It knew them as the dog knows the alliance that its\nforefathers made with man. A mandolin weeps the tears that its master\ncannot shed, or utters the prayers that are deeper than its master's\nlips can draw, as a dog will fight for his master with teeth that are\nlonger than man's. And if the moonlight streamed on untroubled, and\nthough Fate was deaf, yet beauty of those fresh strains going starward\nfrom under his fingers touched at least the heart of Rodriguez and\ngilded his dreams and gave to his thoughts a mournful autumnal glory,\nuntil he sang all newly as he never had sung before, with limpid voice\nalong the edge of tears, a love-song old as the woods of his father's\nvalleys at whose edge he had heard it once drift through the evening.\nAnd as he played and sang with his young soul in the music he fancied\n(and why not, if they care aught for our souls in Heaven?) he fancied\nthe angles putting their hands each one on a star and leaning out of\nHeaven through the constellations to listen.\n\n\"A vile song, se\u00f1or, and a vile tune with it,\" said a voice quite close.\n\nHowever much the words hurt his pride in his mandolin Rodriguez\nrecognised in the voice the hidalgo's accent and knew that it was an\nequal that now approached him in the moonlight round a corner of the\nhouse with the balcony; and he knew that the request he courteously\nmade would be as courteously granted.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" he said, \"I pray you to permit me to lean my mandolin against\nthe wall securely before we speak of my song.\"\n\n\"Most surely, se\u00f1or,\" the stranger replied, \"for there is no fault with\nthe mandolin.\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" Rodriguez said, \"I thank you profoundly.\" And he bowed to the\ngallant, whom he now perceived to be young, a youth tall and lithe like\nhimself, one whom we might have chosen for these chronicles had we not\nfound Rodriguez.\n\nThen Rodriguez stepped back a short way and placed his kerchief on the\nground; and upon this he put his mandolin and leaned it against the\nwall. When the mandolin was safe from dust or accident he approached\nthe stranger and drew his sword.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" he said, \"we will now discuss music.\"\n\n\"Right gladly, se\u00f1or,\" said the young man, who now drew his sword also.\nThere were no clouds; the moon was full; the evening promised well.\n\nScarcely had the flash of thin rapiers crossing each other by moonlight\nbegun to gleam in the street when Morano appeared beside them and stood\nthere watching. He had bought his bacon and gone straight to the house\nwith the balcony. For though he knew no Latin he had not missed the\nsilent greeting that had welcomed his master to that village, or failed\nto interpret the gist of the words that Rodriguez' dumb glance would\nhave said. He stood there watching while each combatant stood his\nground.\n\nAnd Rodriguez remembered all those passes and feints that he had had\nfrom his father, and which Sevastiani, a master of arms in Madrid, had\ntaught in his father's youth: and some were famous and some were little\nknown. And all these passes, as he tried them one by one, his unknown\nantagonist parried. And for a moment Rodriguez feared that Morano would\nsee those passes in which he trusted foiled by that unknown sword, and\nthen he reflected that Morano knew nothing of the craft of the rapier,\nand with more content at that thought he parried thrusts that were\nstrange to him. But something told Morano that in this fight the\nstranger was master and that along that pale-blue, moonlit, unknown\nsword lurked a sure death for Rodriguez. He moved from his place of\nvantage and was soon lost in large shadows; while the rapiers played\nand blade rippled on blade with a sound as though Death were gently\nsharpening his scythe in the dark. And now Rodriguez was giving ground,\nnow his antagonist pressed him; thrusts that he believed invincible had\nfailed; now he parried wearily and had at once to parry again; the\nunknown pressed on, was upon him, was scattering his weakening parries;\ndrew back his rapier for a deadlier pass, learned in a secret school,\nin a hut on mountains he knew, and practised surely; and fell in a heap\nupon Rodriguez' feet, struck full on the back of the head by Morano's\nfrying-pan.\n\n\"Most vile knave,\" shouted Rodriguez as he saw Morano before him with\nhis frying-pan in his hand, and with something of the stupid expression\nthat you see on the face of a dog that has done some foolish thing\nwhich it thinks will delight its master.\n\n\"Master! I am your servant,\" said Morano.\n\n\"Vile, miserable knave,\" replied Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said plaintively, \"shall I see to your comforts, your\nfood, and not to your life?\"\n\n\"Silence,\" thundered Rodriguez as he stooped anxiously to his\nantagonist, who was not unconscious but only very giddy and who now\nrose to his feet with the help of Rodriguez.\n\n\"Alas, se\u00f1or,\" said Rodriguez, \"the foul knave is my servant. He shall\nbe flogged. He shall be flayed. His vile flesh shall be cut off him.\nDoes the hurt pain you, se\u00f1or? Sit and rest while I beat the knave, and\nthen we will continue our meeting.\"\n\nAnd he ran to his kerchief on which rested his mandolin and laid it\nupon the dust for the stranger.\n\n\"No, no,\" said he. \"My head clears again. It is nothing.\"\n\n\"But rest, se\u00f1or, rest,\" said Rodriguez. \"It is always well to rest\nbefore an encounter. Rest while I punish the knave.\"\n\nAnd he led him to where the kerchief lay on the ground. \"Let me see the\nhurt, se\u00f1or,\" he continued. And the stranger removed his plumed hat as\nRodriguez compelled him to sit down. He straightened out the hat as he\nsat, and the hurt was shown to be of no great consequence.\n\n\"The blessed Saints be praised,\" Rodriguez said. \"It need not stop our\nencounter. But rest awhile, se\u00f1or.\"\n\n\"Indeed, it is nothing,\" he answered.\n\n\"But the indignity is immeasurable,\" sighed Rodriguez. \"Would you care,\nse\u00f1or, when you are well rested to give the chastisement yourself?\"\n\n\"As far as that goes,\" said the stranger, \"I can chastise him now.\"\n\n\"If you are fully recovered, se\u00f1or,\" Rodriguez said, \"my own sword is\nat your disposal to beat him sore with the flat of it, or how you will.\nThus no dishonour shall touch your sword from the skin of so vile a\nknave.\"\n\nThe stranger smiled: the idea appealed to him.\n\n\"You make a noble amend, se\u00f1or,\" he said as he bowed over Rodriguez'\nproffered sword.\n\nMorano had not moved far, but stood near, wondering. \"What should a\nservant do if not work for his master?\" he wondered. And how work for\nhim when dead? And dead, as it seemed to Morano, through his own fault\nif he allowed any man to kill him when he perceived him about to do so.\nHe stood there puzzled. And suddenly he saw the stranger coming angrily\ntowards him in the clear moonlight with a sword. Morano was frightened.\n\nAs the hidalgo came up to him he stretched out his left hand to seize\nMorano by the shoulder. Up went the frying-pan, the stranger parried,\nbut against a stroke that no school taught or knew, and for the second\ntime he went down in the dust with a reeling head. Rodriguez turned\ntoward Morano and said to him ... No, realism is all very well, and I\nknow that my duty as author is to tell all that happened, and I could\nwin mighty praise as a bold, unconventional writer; at the same time,\nsome young lady will be reading all this next year in some far country,\nor in twenty years in England, and I would sooner she should not read\nwhat Rodriguez said. I do not, I trust, disappoint her. But the gist of\nit was that he should leave that place now and depart from his service\nfor ever. And hearing those words Morano turned mournfully away and was\nat once lost in the darkness. While Rodriguez ran once more to help his\nfallen antagonist. \"Se\u00f1or, se\u00f1or,\" he said with an emotion that some\nwearing centuries and a cold climate have taught us not to show, and\nbeyond those words he could find no more to say.\n\n\"Giddy, only giddy,\" said the stranger.\n\nA tear fell on his forehead as Rodriguez helped him to his feet.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" Rodriguez said fervently, \"we will finish our encounter come\nwhat may. The knave is gone and ...\"\n\n\"But I am somewhat giddy,\" said the other.\n\n\"I will take off one of my shoes,\" said Rodriguez, \"leaving the other\non. It will equalise our unsteadiness, and you shall not be\ndisappointed in our encounter. Come,\" he added kindly.\n\n\"I cannot see so clearly as before,\" the young hidalgo murmured.\n\n\"I will bandage my right eye also,\" said Rodriguez, \"and if this cannot\nequalise it ...\"\n\n\"It is a most fair offer,\" said the young man.\n\n\"I could not bear that you should be disappointed of your encounter,\"\nRodriguez said, \"by this spirit of Hell that has got itself clothed in\nfat and dares to usurp the dignity of man.\"\n\n\"It is a right fair offer,\" the young man said again.\n\n\"Rest yourself, se\u00f1or,\" said Rodriguez, \"while I take off my shoe,\" and\nhe indicated his kerchief which was still on the ground.\n\nThe stranger sat down a little wearily, and Rodriguez sitting upon the\ndust took off his left shoe. And now he began to think a little\nwistfully of the face that had shone from that balcony, where all was\ndark now in black shadow unlit by the moon. The emptiness of the\nbalcony and its darkness oppressed him; for he could scarcely hope to\nsurvive an encounter with that swordsman, whose skill he now recognised\nas being of a different class from his own, a class of which he knew\nnothing. All his own feints and passes were known, while those of his\nantagonist had been strange and new, and he might well have even\nothers. The stranger's giddiness did not alter the situation, for\nRodriguez knew that his handicap was fair and even generous. He\nbelieved he was near his grave, and could see no spark of light to\nbanish that dark belief; yet more chances than we can see often guard\nus on such occasions. The absence of Serafina saddened him like a\nsorrowful sunset.\n\nRodriguez rose and limped with his one shoe off to the stranger, who\nwas sitting upon his kerchief.\n\n\"I will bandage my right eye now, se\u00f1or,\" he said.\n\nThe young man rose and shook the dust from the kerchief and gave it to\nRodriguez with a renewed expression of his gratitude at the fairness of\nthe strange handicap. When Rodriguez had bandaged his eye the stranger\nreturned his sword to him, which he had held in his hand since his\neffort to beat Morano, and drawing his own stepped back a few paces\nfrom him. Rodriguez took one hopeless look at the balcony, saw it as\nempty and as black as ever, then he faced his antagonist, waiting.\n\n\"Bandage one eye, indeed!\" muttered Morano as he stepped up behind the\nstranger and knocked him down for the third time with a blow over the\nhead from his frying-pan.\n\nThe young hidalgo dropped silently.\n\nRodriguez uttered one scream of anger and rushed at Morano with his\nsword. Morano had already started to run; and, knowing well that he was\nrunning for his life, he kept for awhile the start that he had of the\nrapier. Rodriguez knew that no plump man of over forty could last\nagainst his lithe speed long. He saw Morano clearly before him, then\nlost sight of him for a moment and ran confidently on pursuing. He ran\non and on. And at last he recognised that Morano had slipped into the\ndarkness, which lies always so near to the moonlight, and was not in\nfront of him at all. So he returned to his fallen antagonist and found\nhim breathing heavily where he fell, scarcely conscious. The third\nstroke of the frying-pan had done its work surely. Rodriguez' fury died\ndown, only because it is difficult to feel two emotions at once: it\ndied down as pity took its place, though every now and then it would\nsuddenly flare and fall again. He returned his sword and lifted the\nyoung hidalgo and carried him to the door of the house under which they\nhad fought.\n\nWith one fist he beat on the door without putting the hurt man down,\nand continued to hit it until steps were heard, and bolts began to\ngrumble, as though disturbed too early from their rusty sleep in stone\nsockets.\n\nThe door of the house with the balcony was opened by a servant who,\nwhen he saw who it was that Rodriguez carried, fled into the house in\nalarm, as one who runs with bad news. He carried one candle and, when\nhe had disappeared with the steaming flame, Rodriguez found himself in\na long hall lit by the moonlight only, which was looking in through the\nsmall contorted panes of the upper part of a high window. Alone with\nechoes and shadows Rodriguez carried the hurt man through the hall, who\nwas muttering now as he came back to consciousness. And, as he went,\nthere came to Rodriguez thoughts between wonder and hope, for he had\nhad no thought at all when he beat on the door except to get shelter\nand help for the hurt man. At the end of the hall they came to an open\ndoor that led into a chamber partly shining with moonlight.\n\n\"In there,\" said the man that he carried.\n\nRodriguez carried him in and laid him on a long couch at the end of the\nroom. Large pictures of men in the blackness, out of the moon's rays,\nfrowned at Rodriguez mysteriously. He could not see their faces in the\ndarkness, but he somehow knew they frowned. Two portraits that were\nclear in the moonlight eyed him with absolute apathy. So cold a welcome\nfrom that house's past generations boded no good to him from those that\ndwelt there today. Rodriguez knew that in carrying the hurt man there\nhe helped at a Christian deed; and yet there was no putting the merits\nof the case against the omens that crowded the chamber, lurking along\nthe edge of moonlight and darkness, disappearing and reappearing till\nthe gloom was heavy with portent. The omens knew. In a weak voice and\nfew words the hurt man thanked him, but the apathetic faces seemed to\nsay What of that? And the frowning faces that he could not see still\nfilled the darkness with anger.\n\nAnd then from the end of the chamber, dressed in white, and all shining\nwith moonlight, came Serafina.\n\nRodriguez in awed silence watched her come. He saw her pass through the\nmoonlight and grow dimmer, and glide to the moonlight again that\nstreamed through another window. A great dim golden circle appeared at\nthe far end of the chamber whence she had come, as the servant returned\nwith his candle and held it high to give light for Dona Serafina. But\nthat one flame seemed to make the darkness only blacker; and for any\ncheerfulness it brought to the gloom it had better never have\nchallenged those masses of darkness at all in that high chamber among\nthe brooding portraits it seemed trivial, ephemeral, modern, ill able\nto cope with the power of ancient things, dead days and forgotten\nvoices, which make their home in the darkness because the days that\nhave usurped them have stolen the light of the sun.\n\nAnd there the man stood holding his candle high, and the rays of the\nmoon became more magical still beside that little mundane, flickering\nthing. And Serafina was moving through the moonlight as though its rays\nwere her sisters, which she met noiselessly and brightly upon some\nisland, as it seemed to Rodriguez, beyond the coasts of Earth, so\nquietly and so brightly did her slender figure move and so aloof from\nhim appeared her eyes. And there came on Rodriguez that feeling that\nsome deride and that others explain away, the feeling of which romance\nis mainly made and which is the aim and goal of all the earth. And his\nlove for Serafina seemed to him not only to be an event in his life but\nto have some part in veiled and shadowy destinies and to have the\nblessing of most distant days: grey beards seemed to look out of graves\nin forgotten places to wag approval: hands seemed to beckon to him out\nof far-future times, where faces were smiling quietly: and, dreaming on\nfurther still, this vast approval that gave benediction to his heart's\nyouthful fancy seemed to widen and widen like the gold of a summer's\nevening or, the humming of bees in summer in endless rows of limes,\nuntil it became a part of the story of man. Spring days of his earliest\nmemory seemed to have their part in it, as well as wonderful evenings\nof days that were yet to be, till his love for Serafina was one with\nthe fate of earth; and, wandering far on their courses, he knew that\nthe stars blessed it. But Serafina went up to the man on the couch with\nno look for Rodriguez.\n\nWith no look for Rodriguez she bent over the stricken hidalgo. He\nraised himself a little on one elbow. \"It is nothing,\" he said,\n\"Serafina.\"\n\nStill she bent over him. He laid his head down again, but now with open\nand undimmed eyes. She put her hand to his forehead, she spoke in a low\nvoice to him; she lavished upon him sympathy for which Rodriguez would\nhave offered his head to swords; and all, thought Rodriguez for three\nblows from a knave's frying-pan: and his anger against Morano flared up\nagain fiercely. Then there came another thought to him out of the\nshadows, where Serafina was standing all white, a figure of solace. Who\nwas this man who so mysteriously blended with the other unknown things\nthat haunted the gloom of that chamber? Why had he fought him at night?\nWhat was he to Serafina? Thoughts crowded up to him from the interior\nof the darkness, sombre and foreboding as the shadows that nursed them.\nHe stood there never daring to speak to Serafina; looking for\npermission to speak, such as a glance might give. And no glance came.\n\nAnd now, as though soothed by her beauty, the hurt man closed his eyes.\nSerafina stood beside him anxious and silent, gleaming in that dim\nplace. The servant at the far end of the chamber still held his one\ncandle high, as though some light of earth were needed against the\nfantastic moon, which if unopposed would give everything over to magic.\nRodriguez stood there, scarcely breathing. All was silent. And then\nthrough the door by which Serafina had come, past that lonely, golden,\nmoon-defying candle, all down the long room across moonlight and\nblackness, came the lady of the house, Serafina's mother. She came, as\nSerafina came, straight toward the man on the couch, giving no look to\nRodriguez, walking something as Serafina walked, with the same poise,\nthe same dignity, though the years had carried away from her the grace\nSerafina had: so that, though you saw that they were mother and\ndaughter, the elder lady called to mind the lovely things of earth,\nlarge gardens at evening, statues dim in the dusk, summer and\nwhatsoever binds us to earthly things; but Serafina turned Rodriguez'\nthoughts to the twilight in which he first saw her, and he pictured her\nnative place as far from here, in mellow fields near the moon, wherein\nshe had walked on twilight outlasting any we know, with all delicate\nthings of our fancy, too fair for the rugged earth.\n\nAs the lady approached the couch upon which the young man was lying,\nand still no look was turned towards Rodriguez, his young dreams fled\nas butterflies sailing high in the heat of June that are suddenly\nplunged in night by a total eclipse of the sun. He had never spoken to\nSerafina, or seen before her mother, and they did not know his name; he\nknew that he, Rodriguez, had no claim to a welcome. But his dreams had\nflocked so much about Serafina's face, basking so much in her beauty,\nthat they now fell back dying; and when a man's dreams die what\nremains, if he lingers awhile behind them?\n\nRodriguez suddenly felt that his left shoe was off and his right eye\nstill bandaged, things that he had not noticed while his only thought\nwas for the man he carried to shelter, but torturing his consciousness\nnow that he thought of himself. He opened his lips to explain; but\nbefore words came to him, looking at the face of Serafina's mother,\nstanding now by the couch, he felt that, not knowing how, he had\nsomehow wronged the Penates of this house, or whatever was hid in the\ndimness of that long chamber, by carrying in this young man there to\nrest from his hurt.\n\nRodriguez' depression arose from these causes, but having arisen, it\ngrew of its own might: he had had nothing to eat since morning, and in\nthe favouring atmosphere of hunger his depression grew gigantic. He\nopened his lips once more to say farewell, was oppressed by all manner\nof thoughts that held him dumb, and turned away in silence and left the\nhouse. Outside he recovered his mandolin and his shoe. He was tired\nwith the weariness of defeated dreams that slept in his spirit\nexhausted, rather than with any fatigue his young muscles had from the\njourney. He needed sleep; he looked at the shuttered houses; then at\nthe soft dust of the road in which dogs lay during the daylight. But\nthe dust was near to his mood, so he lay down where he had fought the\nunknown hidalgo. A light wind wandered the street like a visitor come\nto the village out of a friendly valley, but Rodriguez' four days on\nthe roads had made him familiar with all wandering things, and the\nbreeze on his forehead troubled him not at all: before it had wearied\nof wandering in the night Rodriguez had fallen asleep. Just by the edge\nof sleep, upon which side he knew not, he heard the window of the\nbalcony creak, and looked up wide awake all in a moment. But nothing\nstirred in the darkness of the balcony and the window was fast shut. So\nwhatever sound came from the window came not from its opening but\nshutting: for a while he wondered; and then his tired thoughts rested,\nand that was sleep.\n\nA light rain woke Rodriguez, drizzling upon his face; the first light\nrain that had fallen in a romantic tale. Storms there had been, lashing\noaks to terrific shapes seen at night by flashes of lightning, through\nwhich villains rode abroad or heroes sought shelter at midnight;\nhurricanes there had been, flapping huge cloaks, fierce hail and\ncopious snow; but until now no drizzle. It was morning; dawn was old;\nand pale and grey and unhappy.\n\nThe balcony above him, still empty, scarcely even held romance now.\nRain dripped from it sadly. Its cheerless bareness seemed worse than\nthe most sinister shadows of night.\n\nAnd then Rodriguez saw a rose lying on the ground beside him. And for\nall the dreams, fancies, and hopes that leaped up in Rodriguez' mind,\nrising and falling and fading, one thing alone he knew and all the rest\nwas mystery: the rose had lain there before the rain had fallen.\nBeneath the rose was white dust, while all around it the dust was\nturning grey with rain.\n\nRodriguez tried to guess how long the rain had fallen. The rose may\nhave lain beside him all night long. But the shadows of mystery receded\nno farther than this one fact that the rose was there before the rain\nbegan. No sign of any kind came from the house.\n\nRodriguez put the rose safe under his coat, wrapped in the kerchief\nthat had guarded the mandolin, to carry it far from Lowlight, through\nplaces familiar with roses and places strange to them; but it remained\nfor him a thing of mystery until a day far from then.\n\nSadly he left the house in the sad rain, marching away alone to look\nfor his wars.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEVENTH CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE CAME TO SHADOW VALLEY\n\n\nRodriguez still believed it to be the duty of any Christian man to kill\nMorano. Yet, more than comfort, more than dryness, he missed Morano's\ncheerful chatter, and his philosophy into which all occasions so easily\nslipped. Upon his first day's journey all was new; the very anemones\nkept him company; but now he made the discovery that lonely roads are\nlong.\n\nWhen he had suggested food or rest Morano had fallen in with his\nwishes; when he had suggested winning a castle in vague wars Morano had\nagreed with him. Now he had dismissed Morano and had driven him away at\nthe rapier's point. There was no one now either to cook his food or to\nbelieve in the schemes his ambition made. There was no one now to speak\nof the wars as the natural end of the journey. Alone in the rain the\nwars seemed far away and castles hard to come by. The unromantic rain\nin which no dreams thrive fell on and on.\n\nThe village of Lowlight was some way behind him, as he went with\nmournful thoughts through the drizzling rain, when he caught the smell\nof bacon. He looked for a house but the plain was bare except for small\nbushes. He looked up wind, which was blowing from the west, whence came\nthe unmistakable smell of bacon: and there was a small fire smoking\ngreyly against a bush; and the fat figure crouching beside it, although\nthe face was averted, was clearly none but Morano. And when Rodriguez\nsaw that he was tenderly holding the infamous frying-pan, the very\nweapon that had done the accursed deed, then he almost felt righteous\nanger; but that frying-pan held other memories too, and Rodriguez felt\nless fury than what he thought he felt. As for killing Morano,\nRodriguez believed, or thought he believed, that he was too far from\nthe road for it to be possible to overtake him to mete out his just\npunishment. As for the bacon, Rodriguez scorned it and marched on down\nthe road. Now one side of the frying-pan was very hot, for it was\ntilted a little and the lard had run sideways. By tilting it back again\nslowly Morano could make the fat run back bit by bit over the heated\nmetal, and whenever it did so it sizzled. He now picked up the\nfrying-pan and one log that was burning well and walked parallel with\nRodriguez. He was up-wind of him, and whenever the bacon-fat sizzled\nRodriguez caught the smell of it. A small matter to inspire thoughts;\nbut Rodriguez had eaten nothing since the morning before, and ideas\nsurged through his head; and though they began with moral indignation\nthey adapted themselves more and more to hunger, until there came the\nidea that since his money had bought the bacon the food was rightfully\nhis, and he had every right to eat it wherever he found it. So much can\nslaves sometimes control the master, and the body rule the brain.\n\nSo Rodriguez suddenly turned and strode up to Morano. \"My bacon,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, for it was beginning to cool, \"let me make\nanother small fire.\"\n\n\"Knave, call me not master,\" said Rodriguez.\n\nMorano, who knew when speech was good, was silent now, and blew on the\nsmouldering end of the log he carried and gathered a handful of twigs\nand shook the rain off them; and soon had a small fire again, warming\nthe bacon. He had nothing to say which bacon could not say better. And\nwhen Rodriguez had finished up the bacon he carefully reconsidered the\ncase of Morano, and there were points in it which he had not thought of\nbefore. He reflected that for the execution of knaves a suitable person\nwas provided. He should perhaps give Morano up to la Garda. His next\nthought was where to find la Garda. And easily enough another thought\nfollowed that one, which was that although on foot and still some way\nbehind four of la Garda were trying to find him. Rodriguez' mind, which\nwas looking at life from the point of view of a judge, changed somewhat\nat this thought. He reflected next that, for the prevention of crime,\nto make Morano see the true nature of his enormity so that he should\nnever commit it again might after all be as good as killing him. So\nwhat we call his better nature, his calmer judgment, decided him now to\ntalk to Morano and not to kill him: but Morano, looking back upon this\nmerciful change, always attributed it to fried bacon.\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez' better nature, \"to offend the laws of\nChivalry is to have against you the swords of all true men.\"\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"that were dreadful odds.\"\n\n\"And rightly,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"I will keep those laws henceforth. I may cook\nbacon for you when you are hungry, I may brush the dust from your\ncloak, I may see to your comforts. This Chivalry forbids none of that.\nBut when I see anyone trying to kill you, master; why, kill you he\nmust, and welcome.\"\n\n\"Not always,\" said Rodriguez somewhat curtly, for it struck him that\nMorano spoke somehow too lightly of sacred things.\n\n\"Not always?\" asked Morano.\n\n\"No,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master, I implore you tell me,\" said Morano, \"when they may kill you\nand when they may not, so that I may never offend again.\"\n\nRodriguez cast a swift glance at him but found his face so full of\npuzzled anxiety that he condescended to do what Morano had asked, and\nbegan to explain to him the rudiments of the laws of Chivalry.\n\n\"In the wars,\" he said, \"you may defend me whoever assails me, or if\nrobbers or any common persons attack me, but if I arrange a meeting\nwith a gentleman, and any knave basely interferes, then is he damned\nhereafter as well as accursed now; for, the laws of Chivalry being\nfounded on true religion, the penalty for their breach is by no means\nconfined to this world.\"\n\n\"Master,\" replied Morano thoughtfully, \"if I be not damned already I\nwill avoid those fires of Hell; and none shall kill you that you have\nnot chosen to kill you, and those that you choose shall kill you\nwhenever you have a mind.\"\n\nRodriguez opened his lips to correct Morano but reflected that, though\nin his crude and base-born way, he had correctly interpreted the law so\nfar as his mind was able.\n\nSo he briefly said \"Yes,\" and rose and returned to the road, giving\nMorano no order to follow him; and this was the last concession he made\nto the needs of Chivalry on account of the sin of Morano. Morano\ngathered up the frying-pan and followed Rodriguez, and when they came\nto the road he walked behind him in silence.\n\nFor three or four miles they walked thus, Morano knowing that he\nfollowed on sufferance and calling no attention to himself with his\ngarrulous tongue. But at the end of an hour the rain lifted; and with\nthe coming out of the sun Morano talked again.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"the next man that you choose to kill you, let him\nbe one too base-born to know the tricks of the rapier, too ignorant to\ndo aught but wish you well, some poor fat fool over forty who shall be\ntoo heavy to elude your rapier's point and too elderly for it to matter\nwhen you kill him at your Chivalry, the best of life being gone already\nat forty-five.\"\n\n\"There is timber here,\" said Rodriguez. \"We will have some more bacon\nwhile you dry my cloak over a fire.\"\n\nThus he acknowledged Morano again for his servant but never\nacknowledged that in Morano's words he had understood any poor sketch\nof Morano's self, or that the words went to his heart.\n\n\"Timber, Master?\" said Morano, though it did not need Rodriguez to\npoint out the great oaks that now began to stand beside their journey,\nbut he saw that the other matter was well and thus he left well alone.\n\nRodriguez waved an arm towards the great trees. \"Yes, indeed,\" said\nMorano, and began to polish up the frying-pan as he walked.\n\nRodriguez, who missed little, caught a glimpse of tears in Morano's\neyes, for all that his head was turned downward over the frying-pan;\nyet he said nothing, for he knew that forgiveness was all that Morano\nneeded, and that he had now given him: and it was much to give,\nreflected Rodriguez, for so great a crime, and dismissed the matter\nfrom his mind.\n\nAnd now their road dipped downhill, and they passed a huge oak and then\nanother. More and more often now they met these solitary giants, till\ntheir view began to be obscured by them. The road dwindled till it was\nno better than a track, the earth beside it was wild and rocky;\nRodriguez wondered to what manner of land he was coming. But\ncontinually the branches of some tree obscured his view and the only\nindication he had of it was from the road he trod, which seemed to tell\nhim that men came here seldom. Beyond every huge tree that they passed\nas they went downhill Rodriguez hoped to get a better view, but always\nthere stood another to close the vista. It was some while before he\nrealised that he had entered a forest. They were come to Shadow Valley.\n\nThe grandeur of this place, penetrated by shafts of sunlight, coloured\nby flashes of floating butterflies, filled by the chaunt of birds\nrising over the long hum of insects, lifted the fallen spirits of\nRodriguez as he walked on through the morning.\n\nHe still would not have exchanged his rose for the whole forest; but in\nthe mighty solemnity of the forest his mourning for the lady that he\nfeared he had lost no longer seemed the only solemn thing: indeed, the\nsombre forest seemed well attuned to his mood; and what complaint have\nwe against Fate wherever this is so. His mood was one of tragic loss,\nthe defeat of an enterprise that his hopes had undertaken, to seize\nvictory on the apex of the world, to walk all his days only just\noutside the edge of Paradise, for no less than that his hopes and his\nfirst love promised each other; and then he walked despairing in small\nrain. In this mood Fate had led him to solemn old oaks standing huge\namong shadows; and the grandeur of their grey grip on the earth that\nhad been theirs for centuries was akin to the grandeur of the high\nhopes he had had, and his despair was somehow soothed by the shadows.\nAnd then the impudent birds seemed to say \"Hope again.\"\n\nThey walked for miles into the forest and lit a fire before noon, for\nRodriguez had left Lowlight very early. And by it Morano cooked bacon\nagain and dried his master's cloak. They ate the bacon and sat by the\nfire till all their clothes were dry, and when the flames from the\ngreat logs fell and only embers glowed they sat there still, with hands\nspread to the warmth of the embers; for to those who wander a fire is\nfood and rest and comfort. Only as the embers turned grey did they\nthrow earth over their fire and continue their journey. Their road grew\nsmaller and the forest denser.\n\nThey had walked some miles from the place where they lit their fire,\nwhen a somewhat unmistakable sound made Rodriguez look ahead of him. An\narrow had struck a birch tree on the right side, ten or twelve paces in\nfront of him; and as he looked up another struck it from the opposite\nside just level with the first; the two were sticking in it ten feet or\nso from the ground. Rodriguez drew his sword. But when a third arrow\nwent over his head from behind and struck the birch tree, whut! just\nbetween the other two, he perceived, as duller minds could have done,\nthat it was a hint, and he returned his sword and stood still. Morano\nquestioned his master with his eyes, which were asking what was to be\ndone next. But Rodriguez shrugged his shoulders: there was no fighting\nwith an invisible foe that could shoot like that. That much Morano\nknew, but he did not know that there might not be some law of Chivalry\nthat would demand that Rodriguez should wave his sword in the air or\nthrust at the birch tree until someone shot him. When there seemed to\nbe no such rule Morano was well content. And presently men came quietly\non to the road from different parts of the wood. They were dressed in\nbrown leather and wore leaf-green hats, and round each one's neck hung\na disk of engraved copper. They came up to the travellers carrying\nbows, and the leader said to Rodriguez:\n\n\"Se\u00f1or, all travellers here bring tribute to the King of Shadow\nValley,\" at the mention of whom all touched hats and bowed their heads.\n\"What do you bring us?\"\n\nRodriguez thought of no answer; but after a moment he said, for the\nsake of loyalty: \"I know one king only.\"\n\n\"There is only one king in Shadow Valley,\" said the bowman.\n\n\"He brings a tribute of emeralds,\" said another, looking at Rodriguez'\nscabbard. And then they searched him and others search Morano. There\nwere eight or nine of them, all in their leaf-green hats, with ribbons\nround their necks of the same colour to hold the copper disks. They\ntook a gold coin from Morano and grey greasy pieces of silver. One of\nthem took his frying-pan; but he looked so pitifully at them as he said\nsimply, \"I starve,\" that the frying-pan was restored to him.\n\nThey unbuckled Rodriguez' belt and took from him sword and scabbard and\nthree gold pieces from his purse. Next they found the gold piece that\nwas hanging round his neck, still stuffed inside his clothes where he\nhad put it when he was riding. Having examined it they put it back\ninside his clothes, while the leader rebuckled his sword-belt about his\nwaist and returned him his three gold-pieces.\n\nOthers returned his money to Morano. \"Master,\" said the leader, bowing\nto Rodriguez, his green hat in hand, \"under our King, the forest is\nyours.\"\n\nMorano was pleased to hear this respect paid to his master, but\nRodriguez was so surprised that he who was never curt without reason\nfound no more to say than \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because we are your servants,\" said the other.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Rodriguez.\n\n\"We are the green bowmen, master,\" he said, \"who hold this forest\nagainst all men for our King.\"\n\n\"And who is he?\" said Rodriguez.\n\nAnd the bowman answered: \"The King of Shadow Valley,\" at which the\nothers all touched hats and bowed heads again. And Rodriguez seeing\nthat the mystery would grow no clearer for any information to be had\nfrom them said: \"Conduct me to your king.\"\n\n\"That, master, we cannot do,\" said the chief of the bowmen. \"There be\nmany trees in this forest, and behind any one of them he holds his\ncourt. When he needs us there is his clear horn. But when men need him\nwho knows which shadow is his of all that lie in the forest?\" Whether\nor not there was anything interesting in the mystery, to Rodriguez it\nwas merely annoying; and finding it grew no clearer he turned his\nattention to shelter for the night, to which all travellers give a\nthought at least once, between noon and sunset.\n\n\"Is there any house on this road, se\u00f1or,\" he said, \"in which we could\nrest the night?\"\n\n\"Ten miles from here,\" said he, \"and not far from the road you take is\nthe best house we have in the forest. It is yours, master, for as long\nas you honour it.\"\n\n\"Come then,\" said Rodriguez, \"and I thank you, se\u00f1or.\"\n\nSo they all started together, Rodriguez with the leader going in front\nand Morano following with all the bowmen. And soon the bowmen were\nsinging songs of the forest, hunting songs, songs of the winter; and\nsongs of the long summer evenings, songs of love. Cheered by this\nmerriment, the miles slipped by.\n\nAnd Rodriguez gathered from the songs they sang something of what they\nwere and of how they lived in the forest, living amongst the woodland\ncreatures till these men's ways were almost as their ways; killing what\nthey needed for food but protecting the woodland things against all\nothers; straying out amongst the villages in summer evenings, and\nalways welcome; and owning no allegiance but to the King of the Shadow\nValley.\n\nAnd the leader told Rodriguez that his name was Miguel Threegeese,\ngiven him on account of an exploit in his youth when he lay one night\nwith his bow by one of the great pools in the forest, where the geese\ncome in winter. He said the forest was a hundred miles long, lying\nmostly along a great valley, which they were crossing. And once they\nhad owned allegiance to kings of Spain, but now to none but the King of\nthe Shadow Valley, for the King of Spain's men had once tried to cut\nsome of the forest down, and the forest was sacred.\n\nBehind him the men sang on of woodland things, and of cottage gardens\nin the villages: with singing and laughter they came to their journey's\nend. A cottage as though built by peasants with boundless material\nstood in the forest. It was a thatched cottage built in the peasant's\nway but of enormous size. The leader entered first and whispered to\nthose within, who rose and bowed to Rodriguez as he entered, twenty\nmore bowmen who had been sitting at a table. One does not speak of the\nbanqueting-hall of a cottage, but such it appeared, for it occupied\nmore than half of the cottage and was as large as the banqueting-hall\nof any castle. It was made of great beams of oak, and high at either\nend just under the thatch were windows with their little square panes\nof bulging bluish glass, which at that time was rare in Spain. A table\nof oak ran down the length of it, cut from a single tree, polished and\ndark from the hands of many men that had sat at it. Boar spears hung on\nthe wall, great antlers and boar's tusks and, carved in the oak of the\nwall and again on a high, dark chair that stood at the end of the long\ntable empty, a crown with oak leaves that Rodriguez recognised. It was\nthe same as the one that was cut on his gold coin, which he had given\nno further thought to, riding to Lowlight, and which the face of\nSerafina had driven from his mind altogether. \"But,\" he said, and then\nwas silent, thinking to learn more by watching than by talking. And his\ncompanions of the road came in and all sat down on the benches beside\nthe ample table, and a brew was brought, a kind of pale mead, that they\ncalled forest water. And all drank; and, sitting at the table, watching\nthem more closely than he could as he walked in the forest, Rodriguez\nsaw by the sunlight that streamed in low through one window that on the\ncopper disks they wore round their necks on green ribbon the design was\nagain the same. It was much smaller than his on the gold coin but the\nsame strange leafy crown. \"Wear it as you go through Shadow Valley,\" he\nnow seemed to remember the man saying to him who put it round his neck.\nBut why? Clearly because it was the badge of this band of men. And this\nother man was one of them.\n\nHis eyes strayed back to the great design on the wall. \"The crown of\nthe forest,\" said Miguel as he saw his eyes wondering at it, \"as you\ndoubtless know, se\u00f1or.\"\n\nWhy should he know? Of course because he bore the design himself. \"Who\nwears it?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"The King of Shadow Valley.\"\n\nMorano was without curiosity; he did not question good drink; he sat at\nthe table with a cup of horn in his hand, as happy as though he had\ncome to his master's castle, though that had not yet been won.\n\nThe sun sank under the oaks, filling the hall with a ruddy glow,\nturning the boar spears scarlet and reddening the red faces of the\nmerry men of the bow.\n\nA dozen of the men went out; to relieve the guard in the forest, Miguel\nexplained. And Rodriguez learned that he had come through a line of\nsentries without ever seeing one. Presently a dozen others came in from\ntheir posts and unslung their bows and laid them on pegs on the wall\nand sat down at the table. Whereat there were whispered words and they\nall rose and bowed to Rodriguez. And Rodriguez had caught the words \"A\nprince of the forest.\" What did it mean?\n\nSoon the long hall grew dim, and his love for the light drew Rodriguez\nout to watch the sunset. And there was the sun under indescribable\nclouds, turning huge and yellow among the trunks of the trees and\ncasting glory munificently down glades. It set, and the western sky\nbecame blood-red and lilac: from the other end of the sky the moon\npeeped out of night. A hush came and a chill, and a glory of colour,\nand a dying away of light; and in the hush the mystery of the great\noaks became magical. A blackbird blew a tune less of this earth than of\nfairy-land.\n\nRodriguez wished that he could have had a less ambition than to win a\ncastle in the wars, for in those glades and among those oaks he felt\nthat happiness might be found under roofs of thatch. But having come by\nhis ambition he would not desert it.\n\nNow rushlights were lit in the great cottage and the window of the long\nroom glowed yellow. A fountain fell in the stillness that he had not\nheard before. An early nightingale tuned a tentative note. \"The forest\nis fair, is it not?\" said Miguel.\n\nRodriguez had no words to say. To turn into words the beauty that was\nnow shining in his thoughts, reflected from the evening there, was no\neasier than for wood to reflect all that is seen in the mirror.\n\n\"You love the forest,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Master,\" said Miguel, \"it is the only land in which we should live our\ndays. There are cities and roads but man is not meant for them. I know\nnot, master, what God intends about us; but in cities we are against\nthe intention at every step, while here, why, we drift along with it.\"\n\n\"I, too, would live here always,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"The house is yours,\" said Miguel. And Rodriguez answered: \"I go\ntomorrow to the wars.\"\n\nThey turned round then and walked slowly back to the cottage, and\nentered the candlelight and the loud talk of many men out of the hush\nof the twilight. But they passed from the room at once by a door on the\nleft, and came thus to a large bedroom, the only other room in the\ncottage.\n\n\"Your room, master,\" said Miguel Threegeese.\n\nIt was not so big as the hall where the bowmen sat, but it was a goodly\nroom. The bed was made of carved wood, for there were craftsmen in the\nforest, and a hunt went all the way round it with dogs and deer. Four\ngreat posts held a canopy over it: they were four young birch-trees\nseemingly still wearing their bright bark, but this had been painted on\ntheir bare timber by some woodland artist. The chairs had not the\nbeauty of the great ages of furniture, but they had a dignity that the\nage of commerce has not dreamed of. Each one was carved out of a single\nblock of wood: there was no join in them anywhere. One of them lasts to\nthis day.\n\nThe skins of deer covered the long walls. There were great basins and\njugs of earthenware. All was forest-made. The very shadows whispering\namong themselves in corners spoke of the forest. The room was rude; but\nbeing without ornament, except for the work of simple craftsmen, it had\nnothing there to offend the sense of right of anyone entering its door,\nby any jarring conflict with the purposes and traditions of the land in\nwhich it stood. All the woodland spirits might have entered there, and\nslept--if spirits sleep--in the great bed, and left at dawn unoffended.\nIn fact that age had not yet learned vulgarity.\n\nWhen Miguel Threegeese left Morano entered.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"they are making a banquet for you.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Rodriguez. \"We will eat it.\" And he waited to hear what\nMorano had come to say, for he could see that it was more than this.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"I have been talking with the bowman. And they\nwill give you whatever you ask. They are good people, master, and they\nwill give you all things, whatever you asked of them.\"\n\nRodriguez would not show to his servant that it all still puzzled him.\n\n\"They are very amiable men,\" he said.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, coming to the point, \"that Garda, they will have\nwalked after us. They must be now in Lowlight. They have all to-night\nto get new shoes on their horses. And to-morrow, master, to-morrow, if\nwe be still on foot...\"\n\nRodriguez was thinking. Morano seemed to him to be talking sense.\n\n\"You would like another ride?\" he said to Morano.\n\n\"Master,\" he answered, \"riding is horrible. But the public garrotter,\nhe is a bad thing too.\" And he meditatively stroked the bristles under\nhis chin.\n\n\"They would give us horses?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Anything, master, I am sure of it. They are good people.\"\n\n\"They'll have news of the road by which they left Lowlight,\" said\nRodriguez reflectively. \"They say la Garda dare not enter the forest,\"\nMorano continued, \"but thirty miles from here the forest ends. They\ncould ride round while we go through.\"\n\n\"They would give us horses?\" said Rodriguez again.\n\n\"Surely,\" said Morano.\n\nAnd then Rodriguez asked where they cooked the banquet, since he saw\nthat there were only two rooms in the great cottage and his inquiring\neye saw no preparations for cooking about the fireplace of either. And\nMorano pointed through a window at the back of the room to another\ncottage among the trees, fifty paces away. A red glow streamed from its\nwindows, growing strong in the darkening forest.\n\n\"That is their kitchen, master,\" he said. \"The whole house is kitchen.\"\nHis eyes looked eagerly at it, for, though he loved bacon, he welcomed\nthe many signs of a dinner of boundless variety.\n\nAs he and his master returned to the long hall great plates of polished\nwood were being laid on the table. They gave Rodriguez a place on the\nright of the great chair that had the crown of the forest carved on the\nback.\n\n\"Whose chair is that?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"The King of Shadow Valley,\" they said.\n\n\"He is not here then,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Who knows?\" said a bowman.\n\n\"It is his chair,\" said another; \"his place is ready. None knows the\nways of the King of Shadow Valley.\"\n\n\"He comes sometimes at this hour,\" said a third, \"as the boar comes to\nHeather Pool at sunset. But not always. None knows his ways.\"\n\n\"If they caught the King,\" said another, \"the forest would perish. None\nloves it as he, none knows its ways as he, no other could so defend it.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said Miguel, \"some day when he be not here they will enter the\nforest.\" All knew whom he meant by they. \"And the goodly trees will\ngo.\" He spoke as a man foretelling the end of the world; and, as men to\nwhom no less was announced, the others listened to him. They all loved\nShadow Valley.\n\nIn this man's time, so they told Rodriguez, none entered the forest to\nhurt it, no tree was cut except by his command, and venturous men\nclaiming rights from others than him seldom laid axe long to tree\nbefore he stood near, stepping noiselessly from among shadows of trees\nas though he were one of their spirits coming for vengeance on man.\n\nAll this they told Rodriguez, but nothing definite they told of their\nking, where he was yesterday, where he might be now; and any questions\nhe asked of such things seemed to offend a law of the forest.\n\nAnd then the dishes were carried in, to Morano's great delight: with\nwide blue eyes he watched the produce of that mighty estate coming in\nthrough the doorway cooked. Boars' heads, woodcock, herons, plates full\nof fishes, all manner of small eggs, a roe-deer and some rabbits, were\ncarried in by procession. And the men set to with their ivory-handled\nknives, each handle being the whole tusk of a boar. And with their\neating came merriment and tales of past huntings and talk of the forest\nand stories of the King of Shadow Valley.\n\nAnd always they spoke of him not only with respect but also with the\ndiscretion, Rodriguez thought, of men that spoke of one who might be\nbehind them at that moment, and one who tolerated no trifling with his\nauthority. Then they sang songs again, such as Rodriguez had heard on\nthe road, and their merry lives passed clearly before his mind again,\nfor we live in our songs as no men live in histories. And again\nRodriguez lamented his hard ambition and his long, vague journey,\nturning away twice from happiness; once in the village of Lowlight\nwhere happiness deserted him, and here in the goodly forest where he\njilted happiness. How well could he and Morano live as two of this\nband, he thought; leaving all cares in cities: for there dwelt cares in\ncities even then. Then he put the thought away. And as the evening wore\naway with merry talk and with song, Rodriguez turned to Miguel and told\nhim how it was with la Garda and broached the matter of horses. And\nwhile the others sang Miguel spoke sadly to him. \"Master,\" he said, \"la\nGarda shall never take you in Shadow Valley, yet if you must leave us\nto make your fortune in the wars, though your fortune waits you here,\nthere be many horses in the forest, and you and your servant shall have\nthe best.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow morning, se\u00f1or?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Even so,\" said Miguel.\n\n\"And how shall I send them to you again?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master, they are yours,\" said Miguel.\n\nBut this Rodriguez would not have, for as yet he only guessed what\nclaim at all he had upon Shadow Valley, his speculations being far more\nconcerned with the identity of the hidalgo that he had fought the night\nbefore, how he concerned Serafina, who had owned the rose that he\ncarried: in fact his mind was busy with such studies as were proper to\nhis age. And at last they decided between them on the house of a\nlowland smith, who was the furthest man that the bowmen knew who was\nsecretly true to their king. At his house Rodriguez and Morano should\nleave the horses. He dwelt sixty miles from the northern edge of the\nforest, and would surely give Rodriguez fresh horses if he possessed\nthem, for he was a true man to the bowman. His name was Gonzalez and he\ndwelt in a queer green house.\n\nThey turned then to listen a moment to a hunting song that all the\nbowmen were singing about the death of a boar. Its sheer merriment\nconstrained them. Then Miguel spoke again. \"You should not leave the\nforest,\" he said sadly.\n\nRodriguez sighed: it was decided. Then Miguel told him of his road,\nwhich ran north-eastward and would one day bring him out of Spain. He\ntold him how towns on the way, and the river Ebro, and with awe and\nreverence he spoke of the mighty Pyrenees. And then Rodriguez rose, for\nthe start was to be at dawn, and walked quietly through the singing out\nof the hall to the room where the great bed was. And soon he slept, and\nhis dreams joined in the endless hunt through Shadow Valley that was\ncarved all round the timbers of his bed.\n\nAll too soon he heard voices, voices far off at first, to which he drew\nnearer and nearer; thus he woke grudgingly out of the deeps of sleep.\nIt was Miguel and Morano calling him.\n\nWhen at length he reached the hall all the merriment of the evening was\ngone from it but the sober beauty of the forest flooded in through both\nwindows with early sunlight and bird-song; so that it had not the sad\nappearance of places in which we have rejoiced, when we revisit them\nnext day or next generation and find them all deserted by dance and\nsong.\n\nRodriguez ate his breakfast while the bowmen waited with their bows all\nstrung by the door. When he was ready they all set off in the early\nlight through the forest.\n\nRodriguez did not criticise his ambition; it sailed too high above his\nlogic for that; but he regretted it, as he went through the beauty of\nthe forest among these happy men. But we must all have an ambition, and\nRodriguez stuck to the one he had. He had another, but it was an\nambition with weak wings that could not come to hope. It depended upon\nthe first. If he could win a castle in the wars he felt that he might\neven yet hope towards Lowlight.\n\nLittle was said, and Rodriguez was all alone with his thoughts. In two\nhours they met a bowman holding two horses. They had gone eight miles.\n\n\"Farewell to the forest,\" said Miguel to Rodriguez. There was almost a\nquery in his voice. Would Rodriguez really leave them? it seemed to say.\n\n\"Farewell,\" he answered.\n\nMorano too had looked sideways towards his master, seeming almost to\nwonder what his answer would be: when it came he accepted it and walked\nto the horses. Rodriguez mounted: willing hands helped up Morano.\n\"Farewell,\" said Miguel once more. And all the bowmen shouted\n\"Farewell.\"\n\n\"Make my farewell,\" said Rodriguez, \"to the King of Shadow Valley.\"\n\nA twig cracked in the forest.\n\n\"Hark,\" said Miguel. \"Maybe that was a boar.\"\n\n\"I cannot wait to hunt,\" said Rodriguez, \"for I have far to go.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Miguel, \"it was the King's farewell to you.\"\n\nRodriguez looked into the forest and saw nothing.\n\n\"Farewell,\" he said again. The horses were fresh and he let his go.\nMorano lumbered behind him. In two miles they came to the edge of the\nforest and up a rocky hill, and so to the plains again, and one more\nadventure lay behind them. Rodriguez turned round once on the high\nground and took a long look back on the green undulations of peace. The\nforest slept there as though empty of men.\n\nThen they rode. In the first hour, easily cantering, they did ten\nmiles. Then they settled down to what those of our age and country and\noccupation know as a hound-jog, which is seven miles an hour. And after\ntwo hours they let the horses rest. It was the hour of the frying-pan.\nMorano, having dismounted, stretched himself dolefully; then he brought\nout all manner of meats. Rodriguez looked wonderingly at them.\n\n\"For the wars, master,\" said Morano. To whatever wars they went, the\ngreen bowmen seemed to have supplied an ample commissariat.\n\nThey ate. And Rodriguez thought of the wars, for the thought of\nSerafina made him sad, and his rejection of the life of the forest\nsaddened him too; so he sought to draw from the future the comfort that\nhe could not get from the past.\n\nThey mounted again and rode again for three hours, till they saw very\nfar off on a hill a village that Miguel had told them was fifty miles\nfrom the forest.\n\n\"We rest the night there,\" said Rodriguez pointing, though it was yet\nseven or eight miles away.\n\n\"All the Saints be praised,\" said Morano.\n\nThey dismounted then and went on foot, for the horses were weary. At\nevening they rode slowly into the village. At an inn whose hospitable\nlooks were as cheerfully unlike the Inn of the Dragon and Knight as\npossible, they demanded lodging for all four. They went first to the\nstable, and when the horses had been handed over to the care of a groom\nthey returned to the inn, and mine host and Rodriguez had to help\nMorano up the three steps to the door, for he had walked nine miles\nthat day and ridden fifty and he was too weary to climb the steps.\n\nAnd later Rodriguez sat down alone to his supper at a table well and\nvariously laden, for the doors of mine hosts' larder were opened wide\nin his honour; but Rodriguez ate sparingly, as do weary men.\n\nAnd soon he sought his bed. And on the old echoing stairs as he and\nmine host ascended they met Morano leaning against the wall. What shall\nI say of Morano? Reader, your sympathy is all ready to go out to the\npoor, weary man. He does not entirely deserve it, and shall not cheat\nyou of it. Reader, Morano was drunk. I tell you this sorry truth rather\nthan that the knave should have falsely come by your pity. And yet he\nis dead now over three hundred years, having had his good time to the\nfull. Does he deserve your pity on that account? Or your envy? And to\nwhom or what would you give it? Well, anyhow, he deserved no pity for\nbeing drunk. And yet he was thirsty, and too tired to eat, and sore in\nneed of refreshment, and had had no more cause to learn to shun good\nwine than he had had to shun the smiles of princesses; and there the\ngood wine had been, sparkling beside him merrily.\n\nAnd now, why now, fatigued as he had been an hour or so ago (but time\nhad lost its tiresome, restless meaning), now he stood firm while all\nthings and all men staggered.\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez as he passed that foolish figure, \"we go sixty\nmiles to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Sixty, master?\" said Morano. \"A hundred: two hundred.\"\n\n\"It is best to rest now,\" said his master.\n\n\"Two hundred, master, two hundred,\" Morano replied.\n\nAnd then Rodriguez left him, and heard him muttering his challenge to\ndistance still, \"Two hundred, two hundred,\" till the old stairway\nechoed with it.\n\nAnd so he came to his chamber, of which he remembered little, for sleep\nlurked there and he was soon with dreams, faring further with them than\nmy pen can follow.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EIGHTH CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE TRAVELLED FAR\n\n\nOne blackbird on a twig near Rodriguez' window sang, then there were\nfifty singing, and morning arose over Spain all golden and wonderful.\n\nRodriguez descended and found mine host rubbing his hands by his good\ntable, with a look on his face that seemed to welcome the day and to\nfind good auguries concerning it. But Morano looked as one that, having\nfallen from some far better place, is ill-content with earth and the\nmundane way.\n\nHe had scorned breakfast; but Rodriguez breakfasted. And soon the two\nwere bidding mine host farewell. They found their horses saddled, they\nmounted at once, and rode off slowly in the early day. The horses were\ntired and, slowly trotting and walking, and sometimes dismounting and\ndragging the horses on, it was nearly two hours before they had done\nten miles and come to the house of the smith in a rocky village: the\nstreet was cobbled and the houses were all of stone.\n\nThe early sparkle had gone from the dew, but it was still morning, and\nmany a man but now sat down to his breakfast, as they arrived and beat\non the door.\n\nGonzalez the smith opened it, a round and ruddy man past fifty, a\ncitizen following a reputable trade, but once, ah once, a bowman.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" said Rodriguez, \"our horses are weary. We have been told you\nwill change them for us.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\" said Gonzalez.\n\n\"The green bowmen in Shadow Valley,\" the young man answered.\n\nAs a meteor at night lights up with its greenish glare flowers and\nblades of grass, twisting long shadows behind them, lights up lawns and\nbushes and the deep places of woods, scattering quiet night for a\nmoment, so the unexpected answer of Rodriguez lit memories in the mind\nof the smith all down the long years; and a twinkle and a sparkle of\nthose memories dancing in woods long forsaken flashed from his eyes.\n\n\"The green bowmen, se\u00f1or,\" said Gonzalez. \"Ah, Shadow Valley!\"\n\n\"We left it yesterday,\" said Rodriguez.\n\nWhen Gonzalez heard this he poured forth questions. \"The forest, se\u00f1or;\nhow is it now with the forest? Do the boars still drink at Heather\nPool? Do the geese go still to Greatmarsh? They should have come early\nthis year. How is it with Larios, Raphael, Migada? Who shoots woodcock\nnow?\"\n\nThe questions flowed on past answering, past remembering: he had not\nspoken of the forest for years. And Rodriguez answered as such\nquestions are always answered, saying that all was well, and giving\nGonzalez some little detail of some trifling affair of the forest,\nwhich he treasured as small shells are treasured in inland places when\ntravellers bring them from the sea; but all that he heard of the forest\nseemed to the smith like something gathered on a far shore of time.\nYes, he had been a bowman once.\n\nBut he had no horses. One horse that drew a cart, but no horses for\nriding at all. And Rodriguez thought of the immense miles lying between\nhim and the foreign land, keeping him back from his ambition; they all\npressed on his mind at once. The smith was sorry, but he could not make\nhorses.\n\n\"Show him your coin, master,\" said Morano.\n\n\"Ah, a small token,\" said Rodriguez, drawing it forth still on its\ngreen ribbon under his clothing. \"The bowman's badge, is it not?\"\n\nGonzalez looked at it, then looked at Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"you shall have your horses. Give me time: you shall\nhave them. Enter, master.\" And he bowed and widely opened the door. \"If\nyou will breakfast in my house while I go to the neighbours you shall\nhave some horses, master.\"\n\nSo they entered the house, and the smith with many bows gave the\ntravellers over to the care of his wife, who saw from her husband's\nmanner that these were persons of importance and as such she treated\nthem both, and as such entertained them to their second breakfast. And\nthis meant they ate heartily, as travellers can, who can go without a\nbreakfast or eat two; and those who dwell in cities can do neither.\n\nAnd while the plump dame did them honour they spoke no word of the\nforest, for they knew not what place her husband's early years had in\nher imagination.\n\nThey had barely finished their meal when the sound of hooves on cobbles\nwas heard and Gonzalez beat on the door. They all went to the door and\nfound him there with two horses. The horses were saddled and bridled.\nThey fixed the stirrups to please them, then the travellers mounted at\nonce. Rodriguez made his grateful farewell to the wife of the smith:\nthen, turning to Gonzalez, he pointed to the two tired horses which had\nwaited all the while with their reins thrown over a hook on the wall.\n\n\"Let the owner of these have them till his own come back,\" he said, and\nadded: \"How far may I take these?\"\n\n\"They are good horses,\" said the smith.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"They could do fifty miles to-day,\" Gonzalez continued, \"and to-morrow,\nwhy, forty, or a little more.\"\n\n\"And where will that bring me?\" said Rodriguez, pointing to the\nstraight road which was going his way, north-eastward.\n\n\"That,\" said Gonzalez, \"that should bring you some ten or twenty miles\nshort of Saspe.\"\n\n\"And where shall I leave the horses?\" Rodriguez asked.\n\n\"Master,\" Gonzalez said, \"in any village where there be a smith, if you\nsay 'these are the horses of the smith Gonzalez, who will come for them\none day from here,' they will take them in for you, master.\"\n\n\"But,\" and Gonzalez walked a little away from his wife, and the horses\nwalked and he went beside them, \"north of here none knows the bowmen.\nYou will get no fresh horses, master. What will you do?\"\n\n\"Walk,\" said Rodriguez.\n\nThen they said farewell, and there was a look on the face of the smith\nalmost such as the sons of men might have worn in Genesis when angels\nvisited them briefly.\n\nThey settled down into a steady trot and trotted thus for three hours.\nNoon came, and still there was no rest for Morano, but only dust and\nthe monotonous sight of the road, on which his eyes were fixed: nearly\nan hour more passed, and at last he saw his master halt and turn round\nin his saddle.\n\n\"Dinner,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nAll Morano's weariness vanished: it was the hour of the frying-pan once\nmore.\n\nThey had done more than twenty-one miles from the house of Gonzalez.\nNimbly enough, in his joy at feeling the ground again, Morano ran and\ngathered sticks from the bushes. And soon he had a fire, and a thin\ncolumn of grey smoke going up from it that to him was always home.\n\nWhen the frying-pan warmed and lard sizzled, when the smell of bacon\nmingled with the smoke, then Morano was where all wise men and all\nunwise try to be, and where some of one or the other some times come\nfor awhile, by unthought paths and are gone again; for that smoky,\nmixed odour was happiness.\n\nNot for long men and horses rested, for soon Rodriguez' ambition was\ndrawing him down the road again, of which he knew that there remained\nto be travelled over two hundred miles in Spain, and how much beyond\nthat he knew not, nor greatly cared, for beyond the frontier of Spain\nhe believed there lay the dim, desired country of romance where roads\nwere long no more and no rain fell. They mounted again and pushed on\nfor this country. Not a village they saw but that Morano hoped that\nhere his affliction would end and that he would dismount and rest; and\nalways Rodriguez rode on and Morano followed, and with a barking of\ndogs they were gone and the village rested behind them. For many an\nhour their slow trot carried them on; and Morano, clutching the saddle\nwith worn arms, already was close to despair, when Rodriguez halted in\na little village at evening before an inn. They had done their fifty\nmiles from the house of Gonzalez, and even a little more.\n\nMorano rolled from his horse and beat on the small green door. Mine\nhost came out and eyed them, preening the point of his beard; and\nRodriguez sat his horse and looked at him. They had not the welcome\nhere that Gonzalez gave them; but there was a room to spare for\nRodriguez, and Morano was promised what he asked for, straw; and there\nwas shelter to be had for the horses. It was all the travellers needed.\n\nChildren peered at the strangers, gossips peeped out of doors to gather\nmaterial concerning them, dogs noted their coming, the eyes of the\nlittle village watched them curiously, but Rodriguez and Morano passed\ninto the house unheeding; and past those two tired men the mellow\nevening glided by like a dream. Tired though Rodriguez was he noticed a\ncertain politeness in mine host while he waited at supper, which had\nnot been noticeable when he had first received him, and rightly put\nthis down to some talk of Morano's; but he did not guess that Morano\nhad opened wide blue eyes and, babbling to his host, had guilelessly\ntold him that his master a week ago had killed an uncivil inn-keeper.\n\nScarcely were late birds home before Rodriguez sought his bed, and not\nall of them were sleeping before he slept.\n\nAnother morning shone, and appeared to Spain, and all at once Rodriguez\nwas wide awake. It was the eighth day of his wanderings.\n\nWhen he had breakfasted and paid his due in silver he and Morano\ndeparted, leaving mine host upon his doorstep bowing with an almost\nperplexed look on his shrewd face as he took the points of moustachios\nand beard lightly in turn between finger and thumb: for we of our day\nenter vague details about ourselves in the book downstairs when we stay\nat inns, but it was mine host's custom to gather all that with his\nsharp eyes. Whatever he gathered, Rodriguez and Morano were gone.\n\nBut soon their pace dwindled, the trot slackening and falling to a\nwalk; soon Rodriguez learned what it is to travel with tired horses. To\nMorano riding was merely riding, and the discomforts of that were so\ngreat that he noticed no difference. But to Rodriguez, his continual\nhitting and kicking his horse's sides, his dislike of doing it, the\nuselessness of it when done, his ambition before and the tired beast\nunderneath, the body always some yards behind the beckoning spirit,\nwere as great vexation as a traveller knows. It came to dismounting and\nwalking miles on foot; even then the horses hung back. They halted an\nhour over dinner while the horses grazed and rested, and they returned\nto their road refreshed by the magic that was in the frying-pan, but\nthe horses were no fresher.\n\nWhen our bodies are slothful and lie heavy, never responding to the\nspirit's bright promptings, then we know dullness: and the burden of it\nis the graver for hearing our spirits call faintly, as the chains of a\nbuccaneer in some deep prison, who hears a snatch of his comrades'\nsinging as they ride free by the coast, would grow more unbearable than\never before. But the weight of his tired horse seemed to hang heavier\non the fanciful hopes that Rodriguez' dreams had made. Farther than\never seemed the Pyrenees, huger than ever their barrier, dimmer and\ndimmer grew the lands of romance.\n\nIf the hopes of Rodriguez were low, if his fancies were faint, what\nmaterial have I left with which to make a story with glitter enough to\nhold my readers' eyes to the page: for know that mere dreams and idle\nfancies, and all amorous, lyrical, unsubstantial things, are all that\nwe writers have of which to make a tale, as they are all that the Dim\nOnes have to make the story of man.\n\nSometimes riding, sometimes going on foot, with the thought of the\nlong, long miles always crowding upon Rodriguez, overwhelming his\nhopes; till even the castle he was to win in the wars grew too pale for\nhis fancy to see, tired and without illusions, they came at last by\nstarlight to the glow of a smith's forge. He must have done forty-five\nmiles and he knew they were near Caspe.\n\nThe smith was working late, and looked up when Rodriguez halted. Yes,\nhe knew Gonzalez, a master in the trade: there was a welcome for his\nhorses.\n\nBut for the two human travellers there were excuses, even apologies,\nbut no spare beds. It was the same in the next three or four houses\nthat stood together by the road. And the fever of Rodriguez' ambition\ndrove him on, though Morano would have lain down and slept where they\nstood, though he himself was weary. The smith had received his horses;\nafter that he cared not whether they gave him shelter or not, the\nalternative being the road, and that bringing nearer his wars and the\ncastle he was to win. And that fancy that led his master Morano allowed\nalways to lead him too, though a few more miles and he would have\nfallen asleep as he walked and dropped by the roadside and slept on.\nLuckily they had gone barely two miles from the forge where the horses\nrested, when they saw a high, dark house by the road and knocked on the\ndoor and found shelter. It was an old woman who let them in, a farmer's\nwife, and she had room for them and one mattress, but no bed. They were\ntoo tired to eat and did not ask for food, but at once followed her up\nthe booming stairs of her house, which were all dark but for her\ncandle, and so came among huge minuetting shadows to the long loft at\nthe top. There was a mattress there which the old woman laid out for\nRodriguez, and a heap of hay for Morano. Just for a moment, as\nRodriguez climbed the last step of the stair and entered the loft where\nthe huge shadows twirled between the one candle's light and the\nunbeaten darkness in corners, just for a moment romance seemed to\nbeckon to him; for a moment, in spite of his fatigue and dejection, in\nspite of the possibility of his quest being crazy, for a moment he felt\nthat great shadows and echoing boards, the very cobwebs even that hung\nfrom the black rafters, were all romantic things; he felt that his was\na glorious adventure and that all these things that filled the loft in\nthe night were such as should fitly attend on youth and glory. In a\nmoment that feeling was gone he knew not why it had come. And though he\nremembered it till grey old age, when he came to know the causes of\nmany things, he never knew what romance might have to do with shadows\nor echoes at night in an empty room, and only knew of such fancies that\nthey came from beyond his understanding, whether from wisdom or folly.\n\nMorano was first asleep, as enormous snores testified, almost before\nthe echoes had died away of the footsteps of the old woman descending\nthe stairs; but soon Rodriguez followed him into the region of dreams,\nwhere fantastic ambitions can live with less of a struggle than in the\nbroad light of day: he dreamed he walked at night down a street of\ncastles strangely colossal in an awful starlight, with doors too vast\nfor any human need, whose battlements were far in the heights of night;\nand chose, it being in time of war, the one that should be his; but the\ngargoyles on it were angry and spoiled the dream.\n\nDream followed dream with furious rapidity, as the dreams of tired men\ndo, racing each other, jostling and mingling and dancing, an\nill-assorted company: myriads went by, a wild, grey, cloudy multitude;\nand with the last walked dawn.\n\nRodriguez rose more relieved to quit so tumultuous a rest than\nrefreshed by having had it.\n\nHe descended, leaving Morano to sleep on, and not till the old dame had\nmade a breakfast ready did he return to interrupt his snores.\n\nEven as he awoke upon his heap of hay Morano remained as true to his\nmaster's fantastic quest as the camel is true to the pilgrimage to\nMecca. He awoke grumbling, as the camel grumbles at dawn when the packs\nare put on him where he lies, but never did he doubt that they went to\nvictorious wars where his master would win a castle splendid with\ntowers.\n\nBreakfast cheered both the travellers. And then the old lady told\nRodriguez that Caspe was but a three hours' walk, and that cheered them\neven more, for Caspe is on the Ebro, which seemed to mark for Rodriguez\na stage in his journey, being carried easily in his imagination, like\nthe Pyrenees. What road he would take when he reached Caspe he had not\nplanned. And soon Rodriguez expressed his gratitude, full of fervour,\nwith many a flowery phrase which lived long in the old dame's mind; and\nthe visit of those two travellers became one of the strange events of\nthat house and was chief of the memories that faintly haunted the\nrafters of the loft for years.\n\nThey did not reach Caspe in three hours, but went lazily, being weary;\nfor however long a man defies fatigue the hour comes when it claims\nhim. The knowledge that Caspe lay near with sure lodging for the night,\nsoothed Rodriguez' impatience. And as they loitered they talked, and\nthey decided that la Garda must now be too far behind to pursue any\nlonger. They came in four hours to the bank of the Ebro and there saw\nCaspe near them; but they dined once more on the grass, sitting beside\nthe river, rather than enter the town at once, for there had grown in\nboth travellers a liking for the wanderers' green table of earth.\n\nIt was a time to make plans. The country of romance was far away and\nthey were without horses.\n\n\"Will you buy horses, master?\" said Morano.\n\n\"We might not get them over the Pyrenees,\" said Rodriguez, though he\nhad a better reason, which was that three gold pieces did not buy two\nsaddled horses. There were no more friends to hire from. Morano grew\nthoughtful. He sat with his feet dangling over the bank of the Ebro.\n\n\"Master,\" he said after a while, \"this river goes our way. Let us come\nby boat, master, and drift down to France at our ease.\"\n\nTo get a river over a range of mountains is harder than to get horses.\nSome such difficulty Rodriguez implied to him; but Morano, having come\nslowly by an idea, parted not so easily with it.\n\n\"It goes our way, master,\" he repeated, and pointed a finger at the\nEbro.\n\nAt this moment a certain song that boatmen sing on that river, when the\ncurrent is with them and they have nothing to do but be idle and their\nlazy thoughts run to lascivious things, came to the ears of Rodriguez\nand Morano; and a man with a bright blue sash steered down the Ebro. He\nhad been fishing and was returning home.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"that knave shall row us there.\"\n\nRodriguez seeing that the idea was fixed in Morano's mind determined\nthat events would move it sooner than argument, and so made no reply.\n\n\"Shall I tell him, master?\" asked Morano.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rodriguez, \"if he can row us over the Pyrenees.\"\n\nThis was the permission that Morano sought, and a hideous yell broke\nfrom his throat hailing the boatman. The boatman looked up lazily, a\nyoung man with strong brown arms, turning black moustaches towards\nMorano. Again Morano hailed him and ran along the bank, while the boat\ndrifted down and the boatman steered in towards Morano. Somehow Morano\npersuaded him to come in to see what he wanted; and in a creek he ran\nhis boat aground, and there he and Morano argued and bargained. But\nRodriguez remained where he was, wondering why it took so long to turn\nhis servant's mind from that curious fancy. At last Morano returned.\n\n\"Well?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"he will row us to the Pyrenees.\"\n\n\"The Pyrenees!\" said Rodriguez. \"The Ebro runs into the sea.\" For they\nhad taught him this at the college of San Josephus.\n\n\"He will row us there,\" said Morano, \"for a gold piece a day, rowing\nfive hours each day.\"\n\nNow between them they had but four gold pieces; but that did not make\nthe Ebro run northward. It seemed that the Ebro, after going their way,\nas Morano had said, for twenty or thirty miles, was joined by the river\nSegre, and that where the Ebro left them, turning eastwards, the course\nof the Segre took them on their way: but it would be rowing against the\ncurrent.\n\n\"How far is it?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"A hundred miles, he says,\" answered Morano. \"He knows it well.\"\n\nRodriguez calculated swiftly. First he added thirty miles; for he knew\nthat his countrymen took a cheerful view of distance, seldom allowing\nany distance to oppress them under its true name at the out set of a\njourney; then he guessed that the boatman might row five miles an hour\nfor the first thirty miles with the stream of the Ebro, and he hoped\nthat he might row three against the Segre until they came near the\nmountains, where the current might grow too strong.\n\n\"Morano,\" he said, \"we shall have to row too.\"\n\n\"Row, master?\" said Morano.\n\n\"We can pay him for four days,\" said Rodriguez. \"If we all row we may\ngo far on our way.\"\n\n\"It is better than riding,\" replied Morano with entire resignation.\n\nAnd so they walked to the creek and Rodriguez greeted the boatman,\nwhose name was Perez; and they entered the boat and he rowed them down\nto Caspe. And, in the house of Perez, Rodriguez slept that night in a\nlarge dim room, untidy with diverse wares: they slept on heaps of\nthings that pertained to the river and fishing. Yet it was late before\nRodriguez slept, for in sight of his mind came glimpses at last of the\nend of his journey; and, when he slept at last, he saw the Pyrenees.\nThrough the long night their mighty heads rejected him, staring\nimmeasurably beyond him in silence, and then in happier dreams they\nbeckoned him for a moment. Till at last a bird that had entered the\ncity of Caspe sang clear and it was dawn. With that first light\nRodriguez arose and awoke Morano. Together they left that long haven of\nlumber and found Perez already stirring. They ate hastily and all went\ndown to the boat, the unknown that waits at the end of all strange\njourneys quickening their steps as they went through the early light.\n\nPerez rowed first and the others took their turns and so they went all\nthe morning down the broad flood of the Ebro, and came in the afternoon\nto its meeting place with the Segre. And there they landed and\nstretched their limbs on shore and lit a fire and feasted, before they\nfaced the current that would be henceforth against them. Then they\nrowed on.\n\nWhen they landed by starlight and unrolled a sheet of canvas that Perez\nhad put in the boat, and found what a bad time starlight is for\npitching a tent, Rodriguez and Morano had rowed for four hours each and\nPerez had rowed for five. They carried no timber in the boat but used\nthe oars for tent-poles and cut tent-pegs with a small hatchet that\nPerez had brought.\n\nThey stumbled on rocks, tore the canvas on bushes, lost the same thing\nover and over again; in fact they were learning the craft of wandering.\nYet at last their tent was up and a good fire comforting them outside,\nand Morano had cooked the food and they had supped and talked, and\nafter that they slept. And over them sleeping the starlight faded away,\nand in the greyness that none of them dreamed was dawn five clear notes\nwere heard so shrill in the night that Rodriguez half waking wondered\nwhat bird of the darkness called, and learned from the answering chorus\nthat it was day.\n\nHe woke Morano who rose in that chilly hour and, striking sparks among\nlast night's embers, soon had a fire: they hastily made a meal and\nwrapped up their tent and soon they were going onward against the tide\nof the Segre. And that day Morano rowed more skilfully; and Rodriguez\nunwrapped his mandolin and played, reclining in the boat while he\nrested from rowing. And the mandolin told them all, what the words of\nnone could say, that they fared to adventure in the land of Romance, to\nthe overthrow of dullness and the sameness of all drear schemes and the\nconquest of discontent in the spirit of man; and perhaps it sang of a\ntime that has not yet come, or the mandolin lied.\n\nThat evening three wiser men made their camp before starlight. They\nwere now far up the Segre.\n\nFor thirteen hours next day they toiled at the oars or lay languid. And\nwhile Rodriguez rested he played on his mandolin. The Segre slipped by\nthem.\n\nThey seemed like no men on their way to war, but seemed to loiter as\nthe bright river loitered, which slid seaward in careless ease and was\nwholly freed from time.\n\nOn this day they heard men speak of the Pyrenees, two men and a woman\nwalking by the river; their voices came to the boat across the water,\nand they spoke of the Pyrenees. And on the next day they heard men\nspeak of war. War that some farmers had fled from on the other side of\nthe mountain. When Rodriguez heard these chance words his dreams came\nnearer till they almost touched the edges of reality.\n\nIt was the last day of Perez' rowing. He rowed well although they\nneared the cradle of the Segre and he struggled against them in his\nyouth. Grey peaks began to peer that had nursed that river. Grey faces\nof stone began to look over green hills. They were the Pyrenees.\n\nWhen Rodriguez saw at last the Pyrenees he drew a breath and was unable\nto speak. Soon they were gone again below the hills: they had but\npeered for a moment to see who troubled the Segre.\n\nAnd the sun set and still they did not camp, but Perez rowed on into\nthe starlight. That day he rowed six hours.\n\nThey pitched their tent as well as they could in the darkness; and,\nbreathing a clear new air all crisp from the Pyrenees, they slept\noutside the threshold of adventure.\n\nRodriguez awoke cold. Once more he heard the first blackbird who sings\nclear at the edge of night all alone in the greyness, the nightingale's\nonly rival; a rival like some unknown in the midst of a crowd who for a\nmoment leads some well-loved song, in notes more liquid than a\nmaster-singer's; and all the crowd joins in and his voice is lost, and\nno one learns his name. At once a host of birds answered him out of dim\nbushes, whose shapes had barely as yet emerged from night. And in this\nchorus Perez awoke, and even Morano.\n\nThey all three breakfasted together, and then the wanderers said\ngood-bye to Perez. And soon he was gone with his bright blue sash,\ndrifting homewards with the Segre, well paid yet singing a little sadly\nas he drifted; for he had been one of a quest, and now he left it at\nthe edge of adventure, near solemn mountains and, beyond them,\nromantic, near-unknown lands. So Perez left and Rodriguez and Morano\nturned again to the road, all the more lightly because they had not\ndone a full day's march for so long, and now a great one unrolled its\nleagues before them.\n\nThe heads of the mountains showed themselves again. They tramped as in\nthe early days of their quest. And as they went the mountains,\nunveiling themselves slowly, dropping film after film of distance that\nhid their mighty forms, gradually revealed to the wanderers the\nmagnificence of their beauty. Till at evening Rodriguez and Morano\nstood on a low hill, looking at that tremendous range, which lifted far\nabove the fields of Earth, as though its mountains were no earthly\nthings but sat with Fate and watched us and did not care.\n\nRodriguez and Morano stood and gazed in silence. They had come twenty\nmiles since morning, they were tired and hungry, but the mountains held\nthem: they stood there looking neither for rest nor food. Beyond them,\nsheltering under the low hills, they saw a little village. Smoke\nstraggled up from it high into the evening: beyond the village woods\nsloped away upwards. But far above smoke or woods the bare peaks\nbrooded. Rodriguez gazed on their austere solemnity, wondering what\nsecret they guarded there for so long, guessing what message they held\nand hid from man; until he learned that the mystery they guarded among\nthem was of things that he knew not and could never know.\n\nTinkle-ting said the bells of a church, invisible among the houses of\nthat far village. Tinkle-ting said the crescent of hills that sheltered\nit. And after a while, speaking out of their grim and enormous silences\nwith all the gravity of their hundred ages, Tinkle-ting said the\nmountains. With this trivial message Echo returned from among the homes\nof the mighty, where she had run with the small bell's tiny cry to\ntrouble their crowned aloofness.\n\nRodriguez and Morano pressed on, and the mountains cloaked themselves\nas they went, in air of many colours; till the stars came out and the\nlights of the village gleamed. In darkness, with surprise in the tones\nof the barking dogs, the two wanderers came to the village where so few\never came, for it lay at the end of Spain, cut off by those mighty\nrocks, and they knew not much of what lands lay beyond.\n\nThey beat on a door below a hanging board, on which was written \"The\nInn of the World's End\": a wandering scholar had written it and had\nbeen well paid for his work, for in those days writing was rare. The\ndoor was opened for them by the host of the inn, and they entered a\nroom in which men who had supped were sitting at a table. They were all\nof them men from the Spanish side of the mountains, farmers come into\nthe village on the affairs of Mother Earth; next day they would be back\nat their farms again; and of the land the other side of the mountains\nthat was so near now they knew nothing, so that it still remained for\nthe wanderers a thing of mystery wherein romance could dwell: and\nbecause they knew nothing of that land the men at the inn treasured all\nthe more the rumours that sometimes came from it, and of these they\ntalked, and mine host listened eagerly, to whom all tales were brought\nsoon or late; and most he loved to hear tales from beyond the mountains.\n\nRodriguez and Morano sat still and listened, and the talk was all of\nwar. It was faint and vague like fable, but rumour clearly said War,\nand the other side of the mountains. It may be that no man has a crazy\nambition without at moments suspecting it; but prove it by the\ntouchstone of fact and he becomes at once as a woman whose invalid son,\nafter years of seclusion indoors, wins unexpectedly some athletic\nprize. When Rodriguez heard all this talk of wars quite near he thought\nof his castle as already won; his thoughts went further even, floating\nthrough Lowlight in the glowing evening, and drifting up and down past\nSerafina's house below the balcony where she sat for ever.\n\nSome said the Duke would never attack the Prince because the Duke's\naunt was a princess from the Troubadour's country. Another said that\nthere would surely be war. Others said that there was war already, and\ntoo late for man to stop it. All said it would soon be over.\n\nAnd one man said that it was the last war that would come, because\ngunpowder made fighting impossible. It could smite a man down, he said,\nat two hundred paces, and a man be slain not knowing whom he fought.\nSome loved fighting and some loved peace, he said, but gunpowder suited\nnone.\n\n\"I like not the sound of that gunpowder, master,\" said Morano to\nRodriguez.\n\n\"Nobody likes it,\" said the man at the table. \"It is the end of war.\"\nAnd some sighed and some were glad. But Rodriguez determined to push on\nbefore the last war was over.\n\nNext morning Rodriguez paid the last of his silver pieces and set off\nwith Morano before any but mine host were astir. There was nothing but\nthe mountains in front of them.\n\nThey climbed all the morning and they came to the fir woods. There they\nlit a good fire and Morano brought out his frying-pan. Over the meal\nthey took stock of their provisions and found that, for all the store\nMorano had brought from the forest, they had now only food for three\ndays; and they were quite without money. Money in those uplifted wastes\nseemed trivial, but the dwindling food told Rodriguez that he must\npress on; for man came among those rocky monsters supplied with all his\nneeds, or perished unnoticed before their stony faces. All the\nafternoon they passed through the fir woods, and as shadows began to\ngrow long they passed the last tree. The village and all the fields\nabout it and the road by which they had come were all spread out below\nthem like little trivial things dimly remembered from very long ago by\none whose memory weakens. Distance had dwarfed them, and the cold\nregard of those mighty peaks ignored them. And then a shadow fell on\nthe village, then tiny lights shone out. It was night down there. Still\nthe two wanderers climbed on in the daylight. With their faces to the\nrocks they scarce saw night climb up behind them. But when Rodriguez\nlooked up at the sky to see how much light was left, and met the calm\ngaze of the evening star, he saw that Night and the peaks were met\ntogether, and understood all at once how puny an intruder is man.\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez, \"we must rest here for the night.\"\n\nMorano looked round him with an air of discontent, not with his\nmaster's words but with the rocks' angular hardness. There was scarce a\nplant of any kind near them now. They were near the snow, which had\nflushed like a wild rose at sunset but was now all grey. Grey cliffs\nseemed to be gazing sheer at eternity; and here was man, the creature\nof a moment, who had strayed in the cold all homeless among his\nbetters. There was no welcome for them there: whatever feeling great\nmountains evoke, THAT feeling was clear in Rodriguez and Morano. They\nwere all amongst those that have other aims, other ends, and know\nnaught of man. A bitter chill from the snow and from starry space drove\nthis thought home.\n\nThey walked on looking for a better place, as men will, but found none.\nAnd at last they lay down on the cold earth under a rock that seemed to\ngive shelter from the wind, and there sought sleep; but cold came\ninstead, and sleep kept far from the tremendous presences of the peaks\nof the Pyrenees that gazed on things far from here.\n\nAn ageing moon arose, and Rodriguez touched Morano and rose up; and the\ntwo went slowly on, tired though they were. Picture the two tiny\nfigures, bent, shivering and weary, walking with clumsy sticks cut in\nthe wood, amongst the scorn of those tremendous peaks, which the moon\nshowed all too clearly.\n\nThey got little warmth from walking, they were too weary to run; and\nafter a while they halted and burned their sticks, and got a little\nwarmth for some moments from their fire, which burned feebly and\nstrangely in those inhuman solitudes.\n\nThen they went on again and their track grew steeper. They rested again\nfor fatigue, and rose and climbed again because of the cold; and all\nthe while the peaks stared over them to spaces far beyond the thought\nof man.\n\nLong before Spain knew anything of dawn a monster high in heaven smiled\nat the sun, a peak out-towering all its aged children. It greeted the\nsun as though this lonely thing, that scorned the race of man since\never it came, had met a mighty equal out in Space. The vast peak\nglowed, and the rest of its grey race took up the greeting leisurely\none by one. Still it was night in all Spanish houses.\n\nRodriguez and Morano were warmed by that cold peak's glow, though no\nwarmth came from it at all; but the sight of it cheered them and their\npulses rallied, and so they grew warmer in that bitter hour.\n\nAnd then dawn came, and showed them that they were near the top of the\npass. They had come to the snow that gleams there everlastingly.\n\nThere was no material for a fire but they ate cold meats, and went\nwearily on. They passed through that awful assemblage of peaks. By noon\nthey were walking upon level ground.\n\nIn the afternoon Rodriguez, tired with the journey and with the heat of\nthe sun, decided that it was possible to sleep, and, wrapping his cloak\naround him, he lay down, doing what Morano would have done, by\ninstinct. Morano was asleep at once and Rodriguez soon after. They\nawoke with the cold at sunset.\n\nRefreshed amazingly they ate some food and started their walk again to\nkeep themselves warm for the night. They were still on level ground and\nset out with a good stride in their relief at being done with climbing.\nLater they slowed down and wandered just to keep warm. And some time in\nthe starlight they felt their path dip, and knew that they were going\ndownward now to the land of Rodriguez' dreams.\n\nWhen the peaks glowed again, first meeting day in her earliest\ndancing-grounds of filmy air, they stood now behind the wanderers.\nBelow them still in darkness lay the land of their dream, but hitherto\nit had always faded at dawn. Now hills put up their heads one by one\nthrough films of mist; woods showed, then hedges, and afterwards\nfields, greyly at first and then, in the cold hard light of morning,\nbecoming more and more real. The sight of the land so long sought, at\nmoments believed by Morano not to exist on earth, perhaps to have faded\naway when fables died, swept their fatigue from the wanderers, and they\nstepped out helped by the slope of the Pyrenees and cheered by the\nrising sun. They came at last to things that welcome man, little shrubs\nflowering, and--at noon--to the edge of a fir wood. They entered the\nwood and lit a merry fire, and heard birds singing, at which they both\nrejoiced, for the great peaks had said nothing.\n\nThey ate the food that Morano cooked, and drew warmth and cheer from\nthe fire, and then they slept a little: and, rising from sleep, they\npushed on through the wood, downward and downward toward the land of\ntheir dreams, to see if it was true.\n\nThey passed the wood and came to curious paths, and little hills, and\nheath, and rocky places, and wandering vales that twisted all awry.\nThey passed through them all with the slope of the mountain behind\nthem. When level rays from the sunset mellowed the fields of France the\nwanderers were walking still, but the peaks were far behind them,\nausterely gazing on the remotest things, forgetting the footsteps of\nman. And walking on past soft fields in the evening, all tilted a\nlittle about the mountain's feet, they had scarcely welcomed the sight\nof the evening star, when they saw before them the mild glow of a\nwindow and knew they were come again to the earth that is mother to\nman. In their cold savagery the inhuman mountains decked themselves out\nlike gods with colours they took from the sunset; then darkened, all\nthose peaks, in brooding conclave and disappeared in the night. And the\nhushed night heard the tiny rap of Morano's hands on the door of the\nhouse that had the glowing window.\n\n\n\n\nTHE NINTH CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE WON A CASTLE IN SPAIN\n\n\nThe woman that came to the door had on her face a look that pleased\nMorano.\n\n\"Are you soldiers?\" she said. And her scared look portended war.\n\n\"My master is a traveller looking for the wars,\" said Morano. \"Are the\nwars near?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not near,\" said the woman; \"not near.\"\n\nAnd something in the anxious way she said \"not near\" pleased Morano\nalso.\n\n\"We shall find those wars, master,\" he said.\n\nAnd then they both questioned her. It seemed the wars were but twenty\nmiles away. \"But they will move northward,\" she said. \"Surely they will\nmove farther off?\"\n\nBefore the next night was passed Rodriguez' dream might come true!\n\nAnd then the man came to the door anxious at hearing strange voices;\nand Morano questioned him too, but he understood never a word. He was a\nFrench farmer that had married a Spanish girl, out of the wonderful\nland beyond the mountains: but whether he understood her or not he\nnever understood Spanish. But both Rodriguez and the farmer's wife knew\nthe two languages, and he had no difficulty in asking for lodging for\nthe night; and she looked wistfully at him going to the wars, for in\nthose days wars were small and not every man went. The night went by\nwith dreams that were all on the verge of waking, which passed like\nghosts along the edge of night almost touched by the light of day. It\nwas Rodriguez whom these dreams visited. The farmer and his wife\nwondered awhile and then slept; Morano slept with all his wonted\nlethargy; but Rodriguez with his long quest now on the eve of\nfulfilment slept a tumultuous sleep. Sometimes his dreams raced over\nthe Pyrenees, running south as far as Lowlight; and sometimes they\nrushed forward and clung like bats to the towers of the great castle\nthat he should win in the war. And always he lay so near the edge of\nsleep that he never distinguished quite between thought and dream.\n\nDawn came and he put by all the dreams but the one that guided him\nalways, and went and woke Morano. They ate hurriedly and left the\nhouse, and again the farmer's wife looked curiously at Rodriguez, as\nthough there were something strange in a man that went to wars: for\nthose days were not as these days. They followed the direction that had\nbeen given them, and never had the two men walked so fast. By the end\nof four hours they had done sixteen miles. They halted then, and Morano\ndrew out his frying-pan with a haughty flourish, and cooked in the\ngrand manner, every movement he made was a triumphant gesture; for they\nhad passed refugees! War was now obviously close: they had but to take\nthe way that the refugees were not taking. The dream was true: Morano\nsaw himself walking slowly in splendid dress along the tapestried\ncorridors of his master's castle. He would have slept after eating and\nwould have dreamed more of this, but Rodriguez commanded him to put the\nthings together: so what remained of the food disappeared again in a\nsack, the frying-pan was slung over his shoulders, and Morano stood\nready again for the road.\n\nThey passed more refugees: their haste was unmistakable, and told more\nthan their lips could have told had they tarried to speak: the wars\nwere near now, and the wanderers went leisurely.\n\nAs they strolled through the twilight they came over the brow of a\nhill, a little fold of the earth disturbed eras ago by the awful\nrushing up of the Pyrenees; and they saw the evening darkening over the\nfields below them and a white mist rising only just clear of the grass,\nand two level rows of tents greyish-white like the mist, with a few\nmore tents scattered near them. The tents had come up that evening with\nthe mist, for there were men still hammering pegs. They were lighting\nfires now as evening settled in. Two hundred paces or so separated each\nrow. It was two armies facing each other.\n\nThe gloaming faded: mist and the tents grew greyer: camp-fires blinked\nout of the dimness and grew redder and redder, and candles began to be\nlit beside the tents till all were glowing pale golden: Rodriguez and\nMorano stood there wondering awhile as they looked on the beautiful\naura that surrounds the horrors of war.\n\nThey came by starlight to that tented field, by twinkling starlight to\nthe place of Rodriguez' dream.\n\n\"For which side will you fight, master?\" said Morano in his ear.\n\n\"For the right,\" said Rodriguez and strode on towards the nearest\ntents, never doubting that he would be guided, though not trying to\ncomprehend how this could be.\n\nThey met with an officer going among his tents. \"Where do you go?\" he\nshouted.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" Rodriguez said, \"I come with my mandolin to sing songs to you.\"\n\nAnd at this the officer called out and others came from their tents;\nand Rodriguez repeated his offer to them not without confidence, for he\nknew that he had a way with the mandolin. And they said that they\nfought a battle on the morrow and could not listen to song: they heaped\nscorn on singing for they said they must needs prepare for the fight:\nand all of them looked with scorn on the mandolin. So Rodriguez bowed\nlow to them with doffed hat and left them; and Morano bowed also,\nseeing his master bow; and the men of that camp returned to their\npreparations. A short walk brought Rodriguez and his servant to the\nother camp, over a flat field convenient for battle. He went up to a\nlarge tent well lit, the door being open towards him; and, having\nexplained his errand to a sentry that stood outside, he entered and saw\nthree persons of quality that were sitting at a table. To them he bowed\nlow in the tent door, saying: \"Se\u00f1ors, I am come to sing songs to you,\nplaying the while upon my mandolin.\"\n\nAnd they welcomed him gladly, saying: \"We fight tomorrow and will\ngladly cheer our hearts with the sound of song and strengthen our men\nthereby.\"\n\nAnd so Rodriguez sang among the tents, standing by a great fire to\nwhich they led him; and men came from the tents and into the circle of\nlight, and in the darkness outside it were more than Rodriguez saw. And\nhe sang to the circle of men and the vague glimmer of faces. Songs of\ntheir homes he sang them, not in their language, but songs that were\nmade by old poets about the homes of their infancy, in valleys under\nfar mountains remote from the Pyrenees. And in the song the yearnings\nof dead poets lived again, all streaming homeward like swallows when\nthe last of the storms is gone: and those yearnings echoed in the\nhearts that beat in the night around the campfire, and they saw their\nown homes. And then he began to touch his mandolin; and he played them\nthe tunes that draw men from their homes and that march them away to\nwar. The tunes flowed up from the firelight: the mandolin knew. And the\nmen heard the mandolin saying what they would say.\n\nIn the late night he ended, and a hush came down on the camp while the\nmusic floated away, going up from the dark ring of men and the fire-lit\nfaces, touching perhaps the knees of the Pyrenees and drifting thence\nwherever echoes go. And the sparks of the camp-fire went straight\nupwards as they had done for hours, and the men that sat around it saw\nthem go: for long they had not seen the sparks stream upwards, for\ntheir thoughts were far away with the mandolin. And all at once they\ncheered. And Rodriguez bowed to the one whose tent he had entered, and\nsought permission to fight for them in the morning.\n\nWith good grace this was accorded him, and while he bowed and well\nexpressed his thanks he felt Morano touching his elbow. And as soon as\nhe had gone aside with Morano that fat man's words bubbled over and\nwere said.\n\n\"Master, fight not for these men,\" he exclaimed, \"for they listen to\nsong till midnight while the others prepare for battle. The others will\nwin the fight, master, and where will your castle be?\"\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez, \"there seems to be truth in that. Yet must we\nfight for the right. For how would it be if those that have denied song\nshould win and thrive? The arm of every good man must be against them.\nThey have denied song, Morano! We must fight against them, you and I,\nwhile we can lay sword to head.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, master,\" said Morano. \"But how shall you come by your\ncastle?\"\n\n\"As for that,\" said Rodriguez, \"it must some day be won, yet not by\ndenying song. These have given a welcome to song, and the others have\ndriven it forth. And what would life be if those that deny song are to\nbe permitted to thrive unmolested by all good men?\"\n\n\"I know not, master,\" said Morano, \"but I would have that castle.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said Rodriguez. \"We must fight for the right.\"\n\nAnd so Rodriguez remained true to those that had heard him sing. And\nthey gave him a casque and breast-plate, proof, they said, against any\nsword, and offered a sword that they said would surely cleave any\nbreast-plate. For they fought not in battle with the nimble rapier. But\nRodriguez did not forsake that famous exultant sword whose deeds he\nknew from many an ancient song; which he had brought so far to give it\nits old rich drink of blood. He believed it the bright key of the\ncastle he was to win.\n\nAnd they gave Rodriguez a good bed on the ground in the tent of the\nthree leaders, the tent to which he first came; for they honoured him\nfor the gift of song that he had, and because he was a stranger, and\nbecause he had asked permission to fight for them in their battle. And\nRodriguez took one look by the light of a lantern at the rose he had\ncarried from Lowlight, then slept a sleep through whose dreams loomed\nup the towers of castles.\n\nDawn came and he slept on still; but by seven all the camp was loudly\nastir, for they had promised the enemy to begin the battle at eight.\nRodriguez breakfasted lightly; for, now that the day of his dreams was\ncome at last and all his hopes depended on the day, an anxiety for many\nthings oppressed him. It was as though his castle, rosy and fair in\ndreams, chilled with its huge cold rocks all the air near it: it was as\nthough Rodriguez touched it at last with his hands and felt a dankness\nof which he had never dreamed.\n\nThen it came to the hour of eight and his anxieties passed.\n\nThe army was now drawn up before its tents in line, but the enemy was\nnot yet ready and so they had to wait.\n\nWhen the signal at length was given and the cannoniers fired their\npieces, and the musketoons were shot off, many men fell. Now Rodriguez,\nwith Morano, was placed on the right, and either through a slight\ndifference in numbers or because of an unevenness in the array of\nbattle they a little overlapped the enemy's left. When a few men fell\nwounded there by the discharge of the musketoons this overlapping was\neven more pronounced.\n\nNow the leaders of that fair army scorned all unknightly devices, and\nwould never have descended to any vile ruse de guerre. The reproach can\ntherefore never be made against them that they ever intended to\noutflank their enemy. Yet, when both armies advanced after the\ndischarge of the musketoons and the merry noise of the cannon, this\noccurred as the result of chance, which no leader can be held\naccountable for; so that those that speak of treachery in this battle,\nand deliberate outflanking, lie.\n\nNow Rodriguez as he advanced with his sword, when the musketoons were\nempty, had already chosen his adversary. For he had carefully watched\nthose opposite to him, before any smoke should obscure them, and had\nselected the one who from the splendour of his dress might be expected\nto possess the finest castle. Certainly this adversary outshone those\namongst whom he stood, and gave fair promise of owning goodly\npossessions, for he wore a fine green cloak over a dress of lilac, and\nhis helm and cuirass had a look of crafty workmanship. Towards him\nRodriguez marched.\n\nThen began fighting foot to foot, and there was a pretty laying on of\nswords. And had there been a poet there that day then the story of\ntheir fight had come down to you, my reader, all that way from the\nPyrenees, down all those hundreds of years, and this tale of mine had\nbeen useless, the lame repetition in prose of songs that your nurses\nhad sung to you. But they fought unseen by those that see for the Muses.\n\nRodriguez advanced upon his chosen adversary and, having briefly bowed,\nthey engaged at once. And Rodriguez belaboured his helm till dints\nappeared, and beat it with swift strokes yet till the dints were\ncracks, and beat the cracks till hair began to appear: and all the\nwhile his adversary's strokes grew weaker and wilder, until he tottered\nto earth and Rodriguez had won. Swift then as cats, while Morano kept\noff others, Rodriguez leaped to his throat, and, holding up the\nstiletto that he had long ago taken as his legacy from the host of the\nDragon and Knight, he demanded the fallen man's castle as ransom for\nhis life.\n\n\"My castle, se\u00f1or?\" said his prisoner weakly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rodriguez impatiently.\n\n\"Yes, se\u00f1or,\" said his adversary and closed his eyes for awhile.\n\n\"Does he surrender his castle, master?\" asked Morano.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Rodriguez. They looked at each other: all at last\nwas well.\n\nThe battle was rolling away from them and was now well within the\nenemy's tents.\n\nHistory says of that day that the good men won. And, sitting, a Muse\nupon her mythical mountain, her decision must needs be one from which\nwe may not appeal: and yet I wonder if she is ever bribed. Certainly\nthe shrewd sense of Morano erred for once; for those for whom he had\npredicted victory, because they prepared so ostentatiously upon the\nfield, were defeated; while the others, having made their preparations\nlong before, were able to cheer themselves with song before the battle\nand to win it when it came.\n\nAnd so Rodriguez was left undisturbed in possession of his prisoner and\nwith the promise of his castle as a ransom. The battle was swiftly\nover, as must needs be where little armies meet so close. The enemy's\ncamp was occupied, his army routed, and within an hour of beginning the\nbattle the last of the fighting ceased.\n\nThe army returned to its tents to rejoice and to make a banquet,\nbringing with them captives and horses and other spoils of war. And\nRodriguez had honour among them because he had fought on the right and\nso was one of those that had broken the enemy's left, from which\ndirection victory had come. And they would have feasted him and done\nhim honour, both for his work with the sword and for his songs to the\nmandolin; and they would have marched away soon to their own country\nand would have taken him with them and advanced him to honour there.\nBut Rodriguez would not stay with them for he had his castle at last,\nand must needs march off at once with his captive and Morano to see the\nfulfilment of his dream. And therefore he thanked the leaders of that\nhost with many a courtesy and many a well-bent bow, and explained to\nthem how it was about his castle, and felicitated them on the victory\nof their good cause, and so wished them farewell. And they said\nfarewell sorrowfully: but when they saw he would go, they gave him\nhorses for himself and Morano, and another for his captive; and they\nheaped them with sacks of provender and blankets and all things that\ncould give him comfort upon a journey: all this they brought him out of\ntheir spoils of war, and they would give him no less that the most that\nthe horses could carry. And then Rodriguez turned to his captive again,\nwho now stood on his feet.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" he said, \"pray tell us all of your castle wherewith you ransom\nyour life.\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" he answered, \"I have a castle in Spain.\"\n\n\"Master,\" broke in Morano, his eyes lighting up with delight, \"there\nare no castles like the Spanish ones.\"\n\nThey got to horse then, all three; the captive on a horse of far poorer\nbuild than the other two and well-laden with sacks, for Rodriguez took\nno chance of his castle cantering, as it were, away from him on four\nhooves through the dust.\n\nAnd when they heard that his journey was by way of the Pyrenees four\nknights of that army swore they would ride with him as far as the\nfrontier of Spain, to bear him company and bring him fuel in the lonely\ncold of the mountains. They all set off and the merry army cheered. He\nleft them making ready for their banquet, and never knew the cause for\nwhich he had fought.\n\nThey came by evening again to the house to which Rodriguez had come two\nnights before, when he had slept there with his castle yet to win. They\nall halted before it, and the man and the woman came to the door\nterrified. \"The wars!\" they said.\n\n\"The wars,\" said one of the riders, \"are over, and the just cause has\nwon.\"\n\n\"The Saints be praised!\" said the woman. \"But will there be no more\nfighting?\"\n\n\"Never again,\" said the horseman, \"for men are sick of gunpowder.\"\n\n\"The Saints be thanked,\" she said.\n\n\"Say not that,\" said the horseman, \"for Satan invented gunpowder.\"\n\nAnd she was silent; but, had none been there, she had secretly thanked\nSatan.\n\nThey demanded the food and shelter that armed men have the right to\ndemand.\n\nIn the morning they were gone. They became a memory, which lingered\nlike a vision, made partly of sunset and partly of the splendour of\ntheir cloaks, and so went down the years that those two folk had, a\nthing of romance, magnificence and fear. And now the slope of the\nmountain began to lift against them, and they rode slowly towards those\nunearthly peaks that had deserted the level fields before ever man came\nto them, and that sat there now familiar with stars and dawn with the\nair of never having known of man. And as they rode they talked. And\nRodriguez talked with the four knights that rode with him, and they\ntold tales of war and told of the ways of fighting of many men: and\nMorano rode behind them beside the captive and questioned him all the\nmorning about his castle in Spain. And at first the captive answered\nhis questions slowly, as if he were weary, or as though he were long\nfrom home and remembered its features dimly; but memory soon returned\nand he answered clearly, telling of such a castle as Morano had not\ndreamed; and the eyes of the fat man bulged as he rode beside him,\ngrowing rounder and rounder as they rode.\n\nThey came by sunset to that wood of firs in which Rodriguez had rested.\nIn the midst of the wood they halted and tethered their horses to\ntrees; they tied blankets to branches and made an encampment; and in\nthe midst of it they made a fire, at first, with pine-needles and the\ndead lower twigs and then with great logs. And there they feasted\ntogether, all seven, around the fire. And when the feast was over and\nthe great logs burning well, and red sparks went up slowly towards the\nsilver stars, Morano turned to the prisoner seated beside him and \"Tell\nthe se\u00f1ors,\" he said, \"of my master's castle.\"\n\nAnd in the silence, that was rather lulled than broken by the\nwhispering wind from the snow that sighed through the wood, the captive\nslowly lifted up his head and spoke in his queer accent.\n\n\"Se\u00f1ors, in Aragon, across the Ebro, are many goodly towers.\" And as he\nspoke they all leaned forward to listen, dark faces bright with\nfirelight. \"On the Ebro's southern bank stands,\" he went on, \"my home.\"\n\nHe told of strange rocks rising from the Ebro; of buttresses built\namong them in unremembered times; of the great towers lifting up in\nmultitudes from the buttresses; and of the mighty wall, windowless\nuntil it came to incredible heights, where the windows shone all safe\nfrom any ladder of war.\n\nAt first they felt in his story his pride in his lost home, and\nwondered, when he told of the height of his towers, how much he added\nin pride. And then the force of that story gripped them all and they\ndoubted never a battlement, but each man's fancy saw between firelight\nand starlight every tower clear in the air. And at great height upon\nthose marvellous towers the turrets of arches were; queer carvings\ngrinned down from above inaccessible windows; and the towers gathered\nin light from the lonely air where nothing stood but they, and flashed\nit far over Aragon; and the Ebro floated by them always new, always\namazed by their beauty.\n\nHe spoke to the six listeners on the lonely mountain, slowly,\nremembering mournfully; and never a story that Romance has known and\ntold of castles in Spain has held men more than he held his listeners,\nwhile the sparks flew up toward the peaks of the Pyrenees and did not\nreach to them but failed in the night, giving place to the white stars.\n\nAnd when he faltered through sorrow, or memory weakening, Morano\nalways, watching with glittering eyes, would touch his arm, sitting\nbeside him, and ask some question, and the captive would answer the\nquestion and so talk sadly on.\n\nHe told of the upper terraces, where heliotrope and aloe and oleander\ntook sunlight far above their native earth: and though but rare winds\ncarried the butterflies there, such as came to those fragrant terraces\nlingered for ever.\n\nAnd after a while he spoke on carelessly, and Morano's questions ended,\nand none of the men in the firelight said a word; but he spoke on\nuninterrupted, holding them as by a spell, with his eyes fixed far away\non black crags of the Pyrenees, telling of his great towers: almost it\nmight have seemed he was speaking of mountains. And when the fire was\nonly a deep red glow and white ash showed all round it, and he ceased\nspeaking, having told of a castle marvellous even amongst the towers of\nSpain: all sitting round the embers felt sad with his sadness, for his\nsad voice drifted into their very spirits as white mists enter houses,\nand all were glad when Rodriguez said to him that one of his ten tall\ntowers the captive should keep and should live in it for ever. And the\nsad man thanked him sadly and showed no joy.\n\nWhen the tale of the castle and those great towers was done, the wind\nthat blew from the snow touched all the hearers; they had seemed to be\naway by the bank of the Ebro in the heat and light of Spain, and now\nthe vast night stripped them and the peaks seemed to close round on\nthem. They wrapped themselves in blankets and lay down in their\nshelters. For a while they heard the wind waving branches and the thump\nof a horse's hoof restless at night; then they all slept except one\nthat guarded the captive, and the captive himself who long lay thinking\nand thinking.\n\nDawn stole through the wood and waked none of the sleepers; the birds\nall shouted at them, still they slept on; and then the captive's guard\nwakened Morano and he stirred up the sparks of the fire and cooked, and\nthey breakfasted late. And soon they left the wood and faced the bleak\nslope, all of them going on foot and leading their horses.\n\nAnd the track crawled on till it came to the scorn of the peaks,\nwinding over a shoulder of the Pyrenees, where the peaks gaze cold and\ncontemptuous away from the things of man.\n\nIn the presence of those that bore them company Rodriguez and Morano\nfelt none of the deadly majesty of those peaks that regard so awfully\nover the solitudes. They passed through them telling cheerfully of wars\nthe four knights had known: and descended and came by sunset to the\nlower edge of the snow. They pushed on a little farther and then\ncamped; and with branches from the last camp that they had heaped on\ntheir horses they made another great fire and, huddling round it in the\nblankets that they had brought, found warmth even there so far from the\nhearths of men.\n\nAnd dawn and the cold woke them all on that treeless slope by barely\nwarm embers. Morano cooked again and they ate in silence. And then the\nfour knights rose sadly and one bowed and told Rodriguez how they must\nnow go back to their own country. And grief seized on Rodriguez at his\nwords, seeing that he was to lose four old friends at once and perhaps\nfor ever, for when men have fought under the same banner in war they\nbecome old friends on that morning.\n\n\"Se\u00f1ors,\" said Rodriguez, \"we may never meet again!\"\n\nAnd the other looked back to the peaks beyond which the far lands lay,\nand made a gesture with his hands.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or, at least,\" said Rodriguez, \"let us camp once more together.\"\n\nAnd even Morano babbled a supplication.\n\n\"Methinks, se\u00f1or,\" he answered, \"we are already across the frontier,\nand when we men of the sword cross frontiers misunderstandings arise,\nso that it is our custom never to pass across them save when we push\nthe frontier with us, adding the lands over which we march to those of\nour liege lord.\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1ors,\" said Rodriguez, \"the whole mountain is the frontier. Come\nwith us one day further.\" But they would not stay.\n\nAll the good things that could be carried they loaded on to the three\nhorses whose heads were turned towards Spain; then turned, all four,\nand said farewell to the three. And long looked each in the face of\nRodriguez as he took his hand in fare well, for they had fought under\nthe same banner and, as wayfaring was in those days, it was not likely\nthat they would ever meet again. They turned and went with their horses\nback towards the land they had fought for.\n\nRodriguez and his captive and Morano went sadly down the mountain. They\ncame to the fir woods, and rested, and Morano cooked their dinner. And\nafter a while they were able to ride their horses.\n\nThey came to the foot of the mountains, and rode on past the Inn of the\nWorld's End. They camped in the open; and all night long Rodriguez or\nMorano guarded the captive.\n\nFor two days and part of the third they followed their old course,\ncatching sight again and again of the river Segre; and then they turned\nfurther west ward to come to Aragon further up the Ebro. All the way\nthey avoided houses and camped in the open, for they kept their captive\nto themselves: and they slept warm with their ample store of blankets.\nAnd all the while the captive seemed morose or ill at ease, speaking\nseldom and, when he did, in nervous jerks.\n\nMorano, as they rode, or by the camp fire at evening, still questioned\nhim now and then about his castle; and sometimes he almost seemed to\ncontradict himself, but in so vast a castle may have been many styles\nof architecture, and it was difficult to trace a contradiction among\nall those towers and turrets. His name was Don\nAlvidar-of-the-Rose-pink-Castle on-Ebro.\n\nOne night while all three sat and gazed at the camp-fire as men will,\nwhen the chilly stars are still and the merry flames are leaping,\nRodriguez, seeking to cheer his captive's mood, told him some of his\nstrange adventures. The captive listened with his sombre air. But when\nRodriguez told how they woke on the mountain after their journey to the\nsun; and the sun was shining on their faces in the open, but the\nmagician and his whole house were gone; then there came another look\ninto Alvidar's eyes. And Rodriguez ended his tale and silence fell,\nbroken only by Morano saying across the fire, \"It is true,\" and the\ncaptive's thoughtful eyes gazed into the darkness. And then he also\nspoke.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" he said, \"near to my rose-pink castle which looks into the\nEbro dwells a magician also.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Indeed so, se\u00f1or,\" said Don Alvidar. \"He is my enemy but dwells in awe\nof me, and so durst never molest me except by minor wonders.\"\n\n\"How know you that he is a magician?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"By those wonders,\" answered his captive. \"He afflicts small dogs and\nmy poultry. And he wears a thin, high hat: his beard is also\nextraordinary.\"\n\n\"Long?\" said Morano.\n\n\"Green,\" answered Don Alvidar.\n\n\"Is he very near the castle?\" said Rodriguez and Morano together.\n\n\"Too near,\" said Don Alvidar.\n\n\"Is his house wonderful?\" Rodriguez asked.\n\n\"It is a common house,\" was the answer. \"A mean, long house of one\nstory. The walls are white and it is well thatched. The windows are\npainted green; there are two doors in it and by one of them grows a\nrose tree.\"\n\n\"A rose tree?\" exclaimed Rodriguez.\n\n\"It seemed a rose tree,\" said Don Alvidar.\n\n\"A captive lady chained to the wall perhaps, changed by magic,\"\nsuggested Morano.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Don Alvidar.\n\n\"A strange house for a magician,\" said Rodriguez, for it sounded like\nany small farmhouse in Spain.\n\n\"He much affects mortal ways,\" replied Don Alvidar.\n\nLittle more was then said, the fire being low: and Rodriguez lay down\nto sleep while Morano guarded the captive.\n\nAnd the day after that they came to Aragon, and in one day more they\nwere across the Ebro; and then they rode west for a day along its\nsouthern bank looking all the while as they rode for Rodriguez' castle.\nAnd more and more silent and aloof, as they rode, grew Don\nAlvidar-of-the-Rose-pink-Castle-on-Ebro.\n\nAnd just before sunset a cry broke from the captive. \"He has taken it!\"\nhe said. And he pointed to just such a house as he had described, a\njolly Spanish farmhouse with white walls and thatch and green shutters,\nand a rose tree by one of the doors just as he had told.\n\n\"The magician's house. But the castle is gone,\" he said.\n\nRodriguez looked at his face and saw real alarm in it. He said nothing\nbut rode on in haste, a dim hope in his mind that explanations at the\nwhite cottage might do something for his lost castle.\n\nAnd when the hooves were heard a woman came out of the cottage door by\nthe rose tree leading a small child by the hand. And the captive called\nto the woman, \"Maria, we are lost. And I gave my great castle with\nrose-pink towers that stood just here as ransom to this se\u00f1or for my\nlife. But now, alas, I see that that magician who dwelt in the house\nwhere you are now has taken it whither we know not.\"\n\n\"Yes, Pedro,\" said the woman, \"he took it yesterday.\" And she turned\nblue eyes upon Rodriguez.\n\nAnd then Morano would be silent no longer. He had thought vaguely for\nsome days and intensely for the last few hundreds yards, and now he\nblurted out the thoughts that boiled in him.\n\n\"Master,\" he shouted, \"he has sold his cattle and bought this raiment\nof his, and that helmet that you opened up for him, and never had any\ncastle on the Ebro with any towers to it, and never knew any magician,\nbut lived in this house himself, and now your castle is gone, master,\nand as for his life ...\"\n\n\"Be silent a moment, Morano,\" said Rodriguez, and he turned to the\nwoman whose eyes were on him still.\n\n\"Was there a castle in this place?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, se\u00f1or. I swear it,\" she said. \"And my husband, though a poor man,\nalways spoke the truth.\"\n\n\"She lies,\" said Morano, and Rodriguez silenced him with a gesture.\n\n\"I will get neighbours who will swear it too,\" she said.\n\n\"A lousy neighbourhood,\" said Morano.\n\nAgain Rodriguez silenced him. And then the child spoke in a frightened\nvoice, holding up a small cross that it had been taught to revere. \"I\nswear it too,\" it said.\n\nRodriguez heaved a sigh and turned away. \"Master,\" Morano cried in\npained astonishment, \"you will not believe their swearings.\"\n\n\"The child swore by the cross,\" he answered.\n\n\"But, master!\" Morano exclaimed.\n\nBut Rodriguez would say no more. And they rode away aimless in silence.\n\nGalloping hooves were heard and Pedro was there. He had come to give up\nhis horse. He gave its reins to the scowling Morano but Rodriguez said\nnever a word. Then he ran round and kissed Rodriguez' hand, who still\nwas silent, for his hopes were lost with the castle; but he nodded his\nhead and so parted for ever from the man whom his wife called Pedro,\nwho called himself Don Alvidar-of-the-Rose-pink-Castle-on-Ebro.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TENTH CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE CAME BACK TO LOWLIGHT\n\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said. But Rodriguez rode ahead and would not speak.\n\nThey were riding vaguely southward. They had ample provisions on the\nhorse that Morano led, as well as blankets, which gave them comfort at\nnight. That night they both got the sleep they needed, now that there\nwas no captive to guard. All the next day they rode slowly in the April\nweather by roads that wandered among tended fields; but a little way\noff from the fields there shone low hills in the sunlight, so wild, so\nfree of man, that Rodriguez remembering them in later years, wondered\nif their wild shrubs just hid the frontiers of fairyland.\n\nFor two days they rode by the edge of unguessable regions. Had Pan\npiped there no one had marvelled, nor though fauns had scurried past\nsheltering clumps of azaleas. In the twilight no tiny queens had court\nwithin rings of toadstools: yet almost, almost they appeared.\n\nAnd on the third day all at once they came to a road they knew. It was\nthe road by which they had ridden when Rodriguez still had his dream,\nthe way from Shadow Valley to the Ebro. And so they turned into the\nroad they knew, as wanderers always will; and, still without aim or\nplan, they faced towards Shadow Valley. And in the evening of the day\nthat followed that, as they looked about for a camping-ground, there\ncame in sight the village on the hill which Rodriguez knew to be fifty\nmiles from the forest: it was the village in which they had rested the\nfirst night after leaving Shadow Valley. They did not camp but went on\nto the village and knocked at the door of the inn. Habit guides us all\nat times, even kings are the slaves of it (though in their presence it\ntakes the prouder name of precedent); and here were two wanderers\nwithout any plans at all; they were therefore defenceless in the grip\nof habit and, seeing an inn they knew, they loitered up to it. Mine\nhost came again to the door. He cheerfully asked Rodriguez how he had\nfared on his journey, but Rodriguez would say nothing. He asked for\nlodging for himself and Morano and stabling for the horses: he ate and\nslept and paid his due, and in the morning was gone.\n\nWhatever impulses guided Rodriguez as he rode and Morano followed, he\nknew not what they were or even that there could be any. He followed\nthe road without hope and only travelled to change his camping-grounds.\nAnd that night he was half-way between the village and Shadow Valley.\n\nMorano never spoke, for he saw that his master's disappointment was\nstill raw; but it pleased him to notice, as he had done all day, that\nthey were heading for the great forest. He cooked their evening meal in\ntheir camp by the wayside and they both ate it in silence. For awhile\nRodriguez sat and gazed at the might-have-beens in the camp-fire: and\nwhen these began to be hidden by white ash he went to his blankets and\nslept. And Morano went quietly about the little camp, doing all that\nneeded to be done, with never a word. When the horses were seen to and\nfed, when the knives were cleaned, when everything was ready for the\nstart next morning, Morano went to his blankets and slept too. And in\nthe morning again they wandered on.\n\nThat evening they saw the low gold rays of the sun enchanting the tops\nof a forest. It almost surprised Rodriguez, travelling without an aim,\nto recognise Shadow Valley. They quickened their slow pace and, before\ntwilight faded, they were under the great oaks; but the last of the\ntwilight could not pierce the dimness of Shadow Valley, and it seemed\nas if night had entered the forest with them.\n\nThey chose a camping-ground as well as they could in the darkness and\nMorano tied the horses to trees a little way off from the camp. Then he\nreturned to Rodriguez and tied a blanket to the windward side of two\ntrees to make a kind of bedroom for his master, for they had all the\nblankets they needed. And when this was done he set the emblem and\nbanner of camps, anywhere all over the world in any time, for he\ngathered sticks and branches and lit a camp-fire. The first red flames\nwent up and waved and proclaimed a camp: the light made a little\ncircle, shadows ran away to the forest, and the circle of light on the\nground and on the trees that stood round it became for that one night\nhome.\n\nThey heard the horses stamp as they always did in the early part of the\nnight; and then Morano went to give them their fodder. Rodriguez sat\nand gazed into the fire, his mind as full of thoughts as the fire was\nfull of pictures: one by one the pictures in the fire fell in; and all\nhis thoughts led nowhere.\n\nHe heard Morano running back the thirty or forty yards he had gone from\nthe camp-fire \"Master,\" Morano said, \"the three horses are gone.\"\n\n\"Gone?\" said Rodriguez. There was little more to say; it was too dark\nto track them and he knew that to find three horses in Shadow Valley\nwas a task that might take years. And after more thought than might\nseem to have been needed he said; \"We must go on foot.\"\n\n\"Have we far to go, master?\" said Morano, for the first time daring to\nquestion him since they left the cottage in Spain.\n\n\"I have nowhere to go,\" said Rodriguez. His head was downcast as he sat\nby the fire: Morano stood and looked at him unhappily, full of a\nsympathy that he found no words to express. A light wind slipped\nthrough the branches and everything else was still. It was some while\nbefore he lifted his head; and then he saw before him on the other side\nof the fire, standing with folded arms, the man in the brown leather\njacket.\n\n\"Nowhere to go!\" said he. \"Who needs go anywhere from Shadow Valley?\"\n\nRodriguez stared at him. \"But I can't stay here!\" he said.\n\n\"There is no fairer forest known to man,\" said the other. \"I know many\nsongs that prove it.\"\n\nRodriguez made no answer but dropped his eyes, gazing with listless\nglance once more at the ground. \"Come, se\u00f1or,\" said the man in the\nleather jacket. \"None are unhappy in Shadow Valley.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" said Rodriguez. Both he and Morano were gazing curiously\nat the man whom they had saved three weeks ago from the noose.\n\n\"Your friend,\" answered the stranger.\n\n\"No friend can help me,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" said the stranger across the fire, still standing with folded\narms, \"I remain under an obligation to no man. If you have an enemy or\nlove a lady, and if they dwell within a hundred miles, either shall be\nbefore you within a week.\"\n\nRodriguez shook his head, and silence fell by the camp-fire. And after\nawhile Rodriguez, who was accustomed to dismiss a subject when it was\nended, saw the stranger's eyes on him yet, still waiting for him to say\nmore. And those clear blue eyes seemed to do more than wait, seemed\nalmost to command, till they overcame Rodriguez' will and he obeyed and\nsaid, although he could feel each word struggling to stay unuttered,\n\"Se\u00f1or, I went to the wars to win a castle and a piece of land thereby;\nand might perchance have wed and ended my wanderings, with those of my\nservant here; but the wars are over and no castle is won.\"\n\nAnd the stranger saw by his face in the firelight, and knew from the\ntones of his voice in the still night, the trouble that his words had\nnot expressed.\n\n\"I remain under an obligation to no man,\" said the stranger. \"Be at\nthis place in four weeks' time, and you shall have a castle as large as\nany that men win by war, and a goodly park thereby.\"\n\n\"Your castle, master!\" said Morano delighted, whose only thought up to\nthen was as to who had got his horses. But Rodriguez only stared: and\nthe stranger said no more but turned on his heel. And then Rodriguez\nawoke out of his silence and wonder. \"But where?\" he said. \"What\ncastle?\"\n\n\"That you will see,\" said the stranger.\n\n\"But, but how ...\" said Rodriguez. What he meant was, \"How can I\nbelieve you?\" but he did not put it in words.\n\n\"My word was never broken,\" said the other. And that is a good boast to\nmake, for those of us who can make it; if we need boast at all.\n\n\"Whose word?\" said Rodriguez, looking him in the eyes.\n\nThe smoke from the fire between them was thickening greyly as though\nsomething had been cast on it. \"The word,\" he said, \"of the King of\nShadow Valley.\"\n\nRodriguez gazing through the increasing smoke saw not to the other\nside. He rose and walked round the fire, but the strange man was gone.\n\nRodriguez came back to his place by the fire and sat long there in\nsilence. Morano was bubbling over to speak, but respected his master's\nsilence: for Rodriguez was gazing into the deeps of the fire seeing\npictures there that were brighter than any that he had known. They were\nso clear now that they seemed almost true. He saw Serafina's face there\nlooking full at him. He watched it long until other pictures hid it,\nvisions that had no meaning for Rodriguez. And not till then he spoke.\nAnd when he spoke his face was almost smiling.\n\n\"Well, Morano,\" he said, \"have we come by that castle at last?\"\n\n\"That man does not lie, master,\" he answered: and his eyes were\nglittering with shrewd conviction.\n\n\"What shall we do then?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Let us go to some village, master,\" said Morano, \"until the time he\nsaid.\"\n\n\"What village?\" Rodriguez asked.\n\n\"I know not, master,\" answered Morano, his face a puzzle of innocence\nand wonder; and Rodriguez fell back into thought again. And the dancing\nflames calmed down to a deep, quiet glow; and soon Rodriguez stepped\nback a yard or two from the fire to where Morano had prepared his bed;\nand, watching the fire still, and turning over thoughts that flashed\nand changed as fast as the embers, he went to wonderful dreams that\nwere no more strange or elusive than that valley's wonderful king.\n\nWhen he spoke in the morning the camp-fire was newly lit and there was\na smell of bacon; and Morano, out of breath and puzzled, was calling to\nhim.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"I was mistaken about those horses.\"\n\n\"Mistaken?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"They were just as I left them, master, all tied to the tree with my\nknots.\"\n\nRodriguez left it at that. Morano could make mistakes and the forest\nwas full of wonders: anything might happen. \"We will ride,\" he said.\n\nMorano's breakfast was as good as ever; and, when he had packed up\nthose few belongings that make a dwelling-place of any chance spot in\nthe wilderness, they mounted the horses, which were surely there, and\nrode away through sunlight and green leaves. They rode slow, for the\nbranches were low over the path, and whoever canters in a forest and\ncloses his eyes against a branch has to consider whether he will open\nthem to be whipped by the next branch or close them till he bumps his\nhead into a tree. And it suited Rodriguez to loiter, for he thought\nthus to meet the King of Shadow Valley again or his green bowmen and\nlearn the answers to innumerable questions about his castle which were\nwandering through his mind.\n\nThey ate and slept at noon in the forest's glittering greenness.\n\nThey passed afterwards by the old house in the wood, in which the\nbowmen feasted, for they followed the track that they had taken before.\nThey knocked loud on the door as they passed but the house was empty.\nThey heard the sound of a multitude felling trees, but whenever they\napproached the sound of chopping ceased. Again and again they left the\ntrack and rode towards the sound of chopping, and every time the\nchopping died away just as they drew close. They saw many a tree half\nfelled, but never a green bowman. And at last they left it as one of\nthe wonders of the forest and returned to the track lest they lose it,\nfor the track was more important to them than curiosity, and evening\nhad come and was filling the forest with dimness, and shadows stealing\nacross the track were beginning to hide it away. In the distance they\nheard the invisible woodmen chopping.\n\nAnd then they camped again and lit their fire; and night came down and\nthe two wanderers slept.\n\nThe nightingale sang until he woke the cuckoo: and the cuckoo filled\nthe leafy air so full of his two limpid notes that the dreams of\nRodriguez heard them and went away, back over their border to\ndreamland. Rodriguez awoke Morano, who lit his fire: and soon they had\nstruck their camp and were riding on.\n\nBy noon they saw that if they hurried on they could come to Lowlight by\nnightfall. But this was not Rodriguez' plan, for he had planned to ride\ninto Lowlight, as he had done once before, at the hour when Serafina\nsat in her balcony in the cool of the evening, as Spanish ladies in\nthose days sometimes did. So they tarried long by their resting-place\nat noon and then rode slowly on. And when they camped that night they\nwere still in the forest.\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez over the camp-fire, \"tomorrow brings me to\nLowlight.\"\n\n\"Aye, master,\" said Morano, \"we shall be there tomorrow.\"\n\n\"That se\u00f1or with whom I had a meeting there,\" said Rodriguez, \"he ...\"\n\n\"He loves me not,\" said Morano.\n\n\"He would surely kill you,\" replied Rodriguez.\n\nMorano looked sideways at his frying-pan.\n\n\"It would therefore be better,\" continued Rodriguez, \"that you should\nstay in this camp while I give such greetings of ceremony in Lowlight\nas courtesy demands.\"\n\n\"I will stay, master,\" said Morano.\n\nRodriguez was glad that this was settled, for he felt that to follow\nhis dreams of so many nights to that balconied house in Lowlight with\nMorano would be no better than visiting a house accompanied by a dog\nthat had bitten one of the family.\n\n\"I will stay,\" repeated Morano. \"But, master ...\" The fat man's eyes\nwere all supplication.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Leave me your mandolin,\" implored Morano.\n\n\"My mandolin?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" said Morano, \"that se\u00f1or who likes my fat body so ill he\nwould kill me, he ...\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Rodriguez, for Morano was hesitating.\n\n\"He likes your mandolin no better, master.\"\n\nRodriguez resented a slight to his mandolin as much as a slight to his\nsword, but he smiled as he looked at Morano's anxious face.\n\n\"He would kill you for your mandolin,\" Morano went on eagerly, \"as he\nwould kill me for my frying-pan.\"\n\nAnd at the mention of that frying-pan Rodriguez frowned, although it\nhad given him many a good meal since the night it offended in Lowlight.\nAnd he would sooner have gone to the wars without a sword than under\nthe balcony of his heart's desire without a mandolin.\n\nSo Rodriguez would hear no more of Morano's request; and soon he left\nthe fire and went to lie down; but Morano sighed and sat gazing on into\nthe embers unhappily; while thoughts plodded slow through his mind,\nleading to nothing. Late that night he threw fresh logs on the\ncamp-fire, so that when they awoke there was still fire in the embers\nAnd when they had eaten their breakfast Rodriguez said farewell to\nMorano, saying that he had business in Lowlight that might keep him a\nfew days. But Morano said not farewell then, for he would follow his\nmaster as far as the midday halt to cook his next meal. And when noon\ncame they were beyond the forest.\n\nOnce more Morano cooked bacon. Then while Rodriguez slept Morano took\nhis cloak and did all that could be done by brushing and smoothing to\ngive back to it that air that it some time had, before it had flapped\nupon so many winds and wrapped Rodriguez on such various beds, and met\nthe vicissitudes that make this story.\n\nFor the plume he could do little.\n\nAnd his master awoke, late in the afternoon, and went to his horse and\ngave Morano his orders. He was to go back with two of the horses to\ntheir last camp in the forest and take with him all their kit except\none blanket and make himself comfortable there and wait till Rodriguez\ncame.\n\nAnd then Rodriguez rode slowly away, and Morano stood gazing mournfully\nand warningly at the mandolin; and the warnings were not lost upon\nRodriguez, though he would never admit that he saw in Morano's staring\neyes any wise hint that he heeded.\n\nAnd Morano sighed, and went and untethered his horses; and soon he was\nriding lonely back to the forest. And Rodriguez taking the other way\nsaw at once the towers of Lowlight.\n\nDoes my reader think that he then set spurs to his horse, galloping\ntowards that house about whose balcony his dreams flew every night? No,\nit was far from evening; far yet from the colour and calm in which the\nlight with never a whisper says farewell to Earth, but with a gesture\nthat the horizon hides takes silent leave of the fields on which she\nhas danced with joy; far yet from the hour that shone for Serafina like\na great halo round her and round her mother's house.\n\nWe cannot believe that one hour more than another shone upon Serafina,\nor that the dim end of the evening was only hers: but these are the\nChronicles of Rodriguez, who of all the things that befell him\ntreasured most his memory of Serafina in the twilight, and who held\nthat this hour was hers as much as her raiment and her balcony: such\ntherefore it is in these chronicles.\n\nAnd so he loitered, waiting for the slow sun to set: and when at last a\ntint on the walls of Lowlight came with the magic of Earth's most faery\nhour he rode in slowly not perhaps wholly unwitting, for all his\nanxious thoughts of Serafina, that a little air of romance from the\nSpring and the evening followed this lonely rider.\n\nFrom some way off he saw that balcony that had drawn him back from the\nother side of the far Pyrenees. Sometimes he knew that it drew him and\nmostly he knew it not; yet always that curved balcony brought him\nnearer, ever since he turned from the field of the false Don Alvidar:\nthe balcony held him with invisible threads, such as those with which\nEarth draws in the birds at evening. And there was Serafina in her\nbalcony.\n\nWhen Rodriguez saw Serafina sitting there in the twilight, just as he\nhad often dreamed, he looked no more but lowered his head to the\nwithered rose that he carried now in his hand, the rose that he had\nfound by that very balcony under another moon. And, gazing still at the\nrose, he rode on under the balcony, and passed it, until his hoof-beats\nwere heard no more in Lowlight and he and his horse were one dim shape\nbetween the night and the twilight. And still he held on.\n\nHe knew not yet, but only guessed, who had thrown that rose from the\nbalcony on the night when he slept on the dust: he knew not who it was\nthat he fought on the same night, and dared not guess what that unknown\nhidalgo might be to Serafina. He had no claim to more from that house,\nwhich once gave him so cold a welcome, than thus to ride by it in\nsilence. And he knew as he rode that the cloak and the plume that he\nwore scarce seemed the same as those that had floated by when more than\na month ago he had ridden past that balcony; and the withered rose that\nhe carried added one more note of autumn. And yet he hoped.\n\nAnd so he rode into twilight and was hid from the sight of the village,\na worn, pathetic figure, trusting vaguely to vague powers of good\nfortune that govern all men, but that favour youth.\n\nAnd, sure enough, it was not yet wholly moonlight when cantering hooves\ncame down the road behind him. It was once more that young hidalgo. And\nas soon as he drew rein beside Rodriguez both reached out merry hands\nas though their former meeting had been some errand of joy. And as\nRodriguez looked him in the eyes, while the two men leaned over\nclasping hands, in light still clear though faded, he could not doubt\nSerafina was his sister.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or,\" said his old enemy, \"will you tarry with us, in our house a\nfew days, if your journey is not urgent?\"\n\nRodriguez gasped for joy; for the messenger from Lowlight, the\ncertainty that here was no rival, the summons to the house of his\ndreams' pilgrimage, came all together: his hand still clasped the\nstranger's. Yet he answered with the due ceremony that that age and\nland demanded: then they turned and rode together towards Lowlight. And\nfirst the young men told each other their names; and the stranger told\nhow he dwelt with his mother and sister in the house that Rodriguez\nknew, and his name was Don Alderon of the Valley of Dawnlight. His\nhouse had dwelt in that valley since times out of knowledge; but then\nthe Moors had come and his forbears had fled to Lowlight: the Moors\nwere gone now, for which Saint Michael and all fighting Saints be\npraised; but there were certain difficulties about his right to the\nValley of Dawnlight. So they dwelt in Lowlight still.\n\nAnd Rodriguez told of the war that there was beyond the Pyrenees and\nhow the just cause had won, but little more than that he was able to\ntell, for he knew scarce more of the cause for which he had fought than\nHistory knows of it, who chooses her incidents and seems to forget so\nmuch. And as they talked they came to the house with the balcony. A\nwaning moon cast light over it that was now no longer twilight; but was\nthe light of wild things of the woods, and birds of prey, and men in\nmountains outlawed by the King, and magic, and mystery, and the quests\nof love. Serafina had left her place: lights gleamed now in the\nwindows. And when the door was opened the hall seemed to Rodriguez so\nmuch less hugely hollow, so much less full of ominous whispered echoes,\nthat his courage rose high as he went through it with Alderon, and they\nentered the room together that they had entered together before. In the\nlong room beyond many candles he saw Dona Serafina and her mother\nrising up to greet him. Neither the ceremonies of that age nor\nRodriguez' natural calm would have entirely concealed his emotion had\nnot his face been hidden as he bowed. They spoke to him; they asked him\nof his travels; Rodriguez answered with effort. He saw by their manner\nthat Don Alderon must have explained much in his favour. He had this\ntime, to cheer him, a very different greeting; and yet he felt little\nmore at ease than when he had stood there late at night before, with\none eye bandaged and wearing only one shoe, suspected of he knew not\nwhat brawling and violence.\n\nIt was not until Dona Mirana, the mother of Serafina, asked him to play\nto them on his mandolin that Rodriguez' ease returned. He bowed then\nand brought round his mandolin, which had been slung behind him; and\nknew a triumphant champion was by him now, one old in the ways of love\nand wise in the sorrows of man, a slender but potent voice,\nwell-skilled to tell what there were not words to say; a voice\nunhindered by language, unlimited even by thought, whose universal\nmeaning was heard and understood, sometimes perhaps by wandering\nspirits of light, beaten far by some evil thought for their heavenly\ncourses and passing close along the coasts of Earth.\n\nAnd Rodriguez played no tune he had ever known, nor any airs that he\nhad heard men play in lanes in Andalusia; but he told of things that he\nknew not, of sadnesses that he had scarcely felt and undreamed\nexaltations. It was the hour of need, and the mandolin knew.\n\nAnd when all was told that the mandolin can tell of whatever is\nwistfulest in the spirit of man, a mood of merriment entered its old\ncurved sides and there came from its hollows a measure such as they\ndance to when laughter goes over the greens in Spain. Never a song sang\nRodriguez; the mandolin said all.\n\nAnd what message did Serafina receive from those notes that were\nstrange even to Rodriguez? Were they not stranger to her? I have said\nthat spirits blown far out of their course and nearing the mundane\ncoasts hear mortal music sometimes, and hearing understand. And if they\ncannot understand those snatches of song, all about mortal things and\nhuman needs, that are wafted rarely to them by chance passions, how\nmuch more surely a young mortal heart, so near Rodriguez, heard what he\nwould say and understood the message however strange.\n\nWhen Dona Mirana and her daughter rose, exchanging their little\ncurtsies for the low bows of Rodriguez, and so retired for the night,\nthe long room seemed to Rodriguez now empty of threatening omens. The\ngreat portraits that the moon had lit, and that had frowned at him in\nthe moonlight when he came here before, frowned at him now no longer.\nThe anger that he had known to lurk in the darkness on pictured faces\nof dead generations had gone with the gloom that it haunted: they were\nall passionless now in the quiet light of the candles. He looked again\nat the portraits eye to eye, remembering looks they had given him in\nthe moonlight, and all looked back at him with ages of apathy; and he\nknew that whatever glimmer of former selves there lurks about portraits\nof the dead and gone was thinking only of their own past days in years\nremote from Rodriguez. Whether their anger had flashed for a moment\nover the ages on that night a month from now, or whether it was only\nthe moonlight, he never knew. Their spirits were back now surely\namongst their own days, whence they deigned not to look on the days\nthat make these chronicles.\n\nNot till then did Rodriguez admit, or even know, that he had not eaten\nsince his noonday meal. But now he admitted this to Don Alderon's\nquestions; and Don Alderon led him to another chamber and there regaled\nhim with all the hospitality for which that time was famous. And when\nRodriguez had eaten, Don Alderon sent for wine, and the butler brought\nit in an olden flagon, dark wine of a precious vintage: and soon the\ntwo young men were drinking together and talking of the wickedness of\nthe Moors. And while they talked the night grew late and chilly and\nstill, and the hour came when moths are fewer and young men think of\nbed. Then Don Alderon showed his guest to an upper room, a long room\ndim with red hangings, and carvings in walnut and oak, which the one\ncandle he carried barely lit but only set queer shadows scampering. And\nhere he left Rodriguez, who was soon in bed, with the great red\nhangings round him. And awhile he wondered at the huge silence of the\nhouse all round him, with never a murmur, never an echo, never a sigh;\nfor he missed the passing of winds, branches waving, the stirring of\nsmall beasts, birds of prey calling, and the hundred sounds of the\nnight; but soon through the silence came sleep.\n\nHe did not need to dream, for here in the home of Serafina he had come\nto his dreams' end.\n\nAnother day shone on another scene; for the sunlight that went in a\nnarrow stream of gold and silver between the huge red curtains had sent\naway the shadows that had stalked overnight through the room, and had\nscattered the eeriness that had lurked on the far side of furniture,\nand all the dimness was gone that the long red room had harboured. And\nfor a while Rodriguez did not know where he was; and for a while, when\nhe remembered, he could not believe it true. He dressed with care,\nalmost with fear, and preened his small moustachios, which at last had\ngrown again just when he would have despaired. Then he descended, and\nfound that he had slept late, though the three of that ancient house\nwere seated yet at the table, and Serafina all dressed in white seemed\nto Rodriguez to be shining in rivalry with the morning. Ah dreams and\nfancies of youth!\n\n\n\n\nTHE ELEVENTH CHRONICLE\n\nHOW HE TURNED TO GARDENING AND HIS SWORD RESTED\n\n\nThese were the days that Rodriguez always remembered; and, side by side\nwith them, there lodged in his memory, and went down with them into his\nlatter years, the days and nights when he went through the Pyrenees and\nwalked when he would have slept but had to walk or freeze: and by some\nqueer rule that guides us he treasured them both in his memory, these\nhappy days in this garden and the frozen nights on the peaks.\n\nFor Serafina showed Rodriguez the garden that behind the house ran\nnarrow and long to the wild. There were rocks with heliotrope pouring\nover them and flowers peeping behind them, and great azaleas all in\ntriumphant bloom, and ropes of flowering creepers coming down from\ntrees, and oleanders, and a plant named popularly Joy of the South, and\nsmall paths went along it edged with shells brought from the far sea.\n\nThere was only one street in the village, and you did not go far among\nthe great azaleas before you lost sight of the gables; and you did not\ngo far before the small paths ended with their shells from the distant\nsea, and there was the mistress of all gardeners facing you, Mother\nNature nursing her children, the things of the wild. She too had\nazaleas and oleanders, but they stood more solitary in their greater\ngarden than those that grew in the garden of Dona Mirana; and she too\nhad little paths, only they were without borders and without end. Yet\nlooking from the long and narrow garden at the back of that house in\nLowlight to the wider garden that sweeps round the world, and is fenced\nby Space from the garden in Venus and by Space from the garden in Mars,\nyou scarce saw any difference or noticed where they met: the solitary\nazaleas beyond were gathered together by distance, and from Lowlight to\nthe horizon seemed all one garden in bloom. And afterwards, all his\nyears, whenever Rodriguez heard the name of Spain, spoken by loyal men,\nit was thus that he thought of it, as he saw it now.\n\nAnd here he used to walk with Serafina when she tended flowers in the\ncool of the morning or went at evening to water favourite blooms. And\nRodriguez would bring with him his mandolin, and sometimes he touched\nit lightly or even sang, as they rested on some carved seat at the\ngarden's end, looking out towards shadowy shrubs on the shining hill,\nbut mostly he heard her speak of the things she loved, of what moths\nflew to their garden, and which birds sang, and how the flowers grew.\nSerafina sat no longer in her balcony but, disguising idleness by other\nnames, they loitered along those paths that the seashells narrowed; yet\nthere was a grace in their loitering such as we have not in our dances\nnow. And evening stealing in from the wild places, from darkening\nazaleas upon distant hills, still found them in the garden, found\nRodriguez singing in idleness undisguised, or anxiously helping in some\ntrivial task, tying up some tendril that had gone awry, helping some\nmagnolia that the wind had wounded. Almost unnoticed by him the\nsunlight would disappear, and the coloured blaze of the sunset, and\nthen the gloaming; till the colours of all the flowers queerly changed\nand they shone with that curious glow which they wear in the dusk. They\nreturned then to the house, the garden behind them with its dim hushed\nair of a secret, before them the candlelight like a different land. And\nafter the evening meal Alderon and Rodriguez would sit late together\ndiscussing the future of the world, Rodriguez holding that it was\nintended that the earth should be ruled by Spain, and Alderon fearing\nit would all go to the Moors.\n\nDays passed thus.\n\nAnd then one evening Rodriguez was in the garden with Serafina; the\nflowers, dim and pale and more mysterious than ever, poured out their\nscent towards the coming night, luring huge hawk-moths from the far\ndusk that was gathering about the garden, to hover before each bloom on\nmyriad wingbeats too rapid for human eye: another inch and the fairies\nhad peeped out from behind azaleas, yet both of these late loiterers\nfelt fairies were surely there: it seemed to be Nature's own most\nsecret hour, upon which man trespasses if he venture forth from his\nhouse: an owl from his hidden haunt flew nearer the garden and uttered\na clear call once to remind Rodriguez of this: and Rodriguez did not\nheed, but walked in silence.\n\nHe had played his mandolin. It had uttered to the solemn hush of the\nunderstanding evening all it was able to tell; and after that cry,\ngrown piteous with so many human longings, for it was an old mandolin,\nRodriguez felt there was nothing left for his poor words to say. So he\nwent dumb and mournful.\n\nSerafina would have heard him had he spoken, for her thoughts vibrated\nyet with the voice of the mandolin, which had come to her hearing as an\nambassador from Rodriguez, but he found no words to match with the\nmandolin's high mood. His eyes said, and his sighs told, what the\nmandolin had uttered; but his tongue was silent.\n\nAnd then Serafina said, as he walked all heavy with silence past a\ncurving slope of dimly glowing azaleas, \"You like flowers, se\u00f1or?\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1orita, I adore them,\" he replied.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Dona Serafina.\n\n\"Indeed I do,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"And yet,\" asked Dona Serafina, \"was it not a somewhat withered or\naltogether faded flower that you carried, unless I fancied wrong, when\nyou rode past our balcony?\"\n\n\"It was indeed faded,\" said Rodriguez, \"for the rose was some weeks\nold.\"\n\n\"One who loved flowers, I thought,\" said Serafina, \"would perhaps care\nmore for them fresh.\"\n\nHalf-dumb though Rodriguez was his shrewdness did not desert him. To\nhave said that he had the rose from Serafina would have been to claim\nas though proven what was yet no more than a hope.\n\n\"Se\u00f1orita,\" he said, \"I found the flower on holy ground.\"\n\n\"I did not know,\" she said, \"that you had travelled so far.\"\n\n\"I found it here,\" he said, \"under your balcony.\"\n\n\"Perchance I let it fall,\" said she. \"It was idle of me.\"\n\n\"I guard it still,\" he said, and drew forth that worn brown rose.\n\n\"It was idle of me,\" said Serafina.\n\nBut then in that scented garden among the dim lights of late evening\nthe ghost of that rose introduced their spirits one to the other, so\nthat the listening flowers heard Rodriguez telling the story of his\nheart, and, bending over the shell-bordered path, heard Serafina's\nanswer; and all they seemed to do was but to watch the evening, with\nleaves uplifted in the hope of rain.\n\nFilm after film of dusk dropped down from where twilight had been, like\nan army of darkness slowly pitching their tents on ground that had been\nlost to the children of light. Out of the wild lands all the owls flew\nnearer: their long, clear cries and the huge hush between them warned\nall those lands that this was not man's hour. And neither Rodriguez nor\nSerafina heard them.\n\nIn pale blue sky where none had thought to see it one smiling star\nappeared. It was Venus watching lovers, as men of the crumbled\ncenturies had besought her to do, when they named her so long ago,\nkneeling upon their hills with bended heads, and arms stretched out to\nher sweet eternal scrutiny. Beneath her wandering rays as they danced\ndown to bless them Rodriguez and Serafina talked low in the sight of\nthe goddess, and their voices swayed through the flowers with whispers\nand winds, not troubling the little wild creatures that steal out shy\nin the dusk, and Nature forgave them for being abroad in that hour;\nalthough, so near that a single azalea seemed to hide it, so near\nseemed to beckon and whisper old Nature's eldest secret.\n\nWhen flowers glimmered and Venus smiled and all things else were dim,\nthey turned on one of those little paths hand in hand homeward.\n\nDona Mirana glanced once at her daughter's eyes and said nothing. Don\nAlderon renewed his talk with Rodriguez, giving reasons for his\napprehension of the conquest of the world by the Moors, which he had\nthought of since last night; and Rodriguez agreed with all that Don\nAlderon said, but understood little, being full of dreams that seemed\nto dance on the further, side of the candlelight to a strange, new,\nunheard tune that his heart was aware of. He gazed much at Serafina and\nsaid little.\n\nHe drank no wine that night with Don Alderon: what need had he of wine?\nOn wonderful journeys that my pen cannot follow, for all the swiftness\nof the wing from which it came; on darting journeys outspeeding the\nlithe swallow or that great wanderer the white-fronted goose, his young\nthoughts raced by a myriad of golden evenings far down the future\nyears. And what of the days he saw? Did he see them truly? Enough that\nhe saw them in vision. Saw them as some lone shepherd on lifted downs\nsees once go by with music a galleon out of the East, with windy sails,\nand masts ablaze with pennants, and heroes in strange dress singing new\nsongs; and the galleon goes nameless by till the singing dies away.\nWhat ship was it? Whither bound? Why there? Enough that he has seen it.\nThus do we glimpse the glory of rare days as we swing round the sun;\nand youth is like some high headland from which to see.\n\nOn the next day he spoke with Dona Mirano. There was little to say but\nto observe the courtesies appropriate to this occasion, for Dona Mirana\nand her daughter had spoken long together already; and of one thing he\ncould say little, and indeed was dumb when asked of it, and that was\nthe question of his home. And then he said that he had a castle; and\nwhen Dona Mirana asked him where it was he said vaguely it was to the\nNorth. He trusted the word of the King of Shadow Valley and so he spoke\nof his castle as a man speaks the truth. And when she asked him of his\ncastle again, whether on rock or river or in leafy lands, he began to\ndescribe how its ten towers stood, being builded of a rock that was\nslightly pink, and how they glowed across a hundred fields, especially\nat evening; and suddenly he ceased, perceiving all in a moment he was\nspeaking unwittingly in the words of Don Alvidar and describing to Dona\nMirana that rose-pink castle on Ebro. And Dona Mirana knew then that\nthere was some mystery about Rodriguez' home.\n\nShe spoke kindly to Rodriguez, yet she neither gave her consent nor yet\nwithheld it, and he knew there was no immediate hope in her words.\nGraceful as were his bows as he withdrew, he left with scarcely another\nword to say. All day his castle hung over him like a cloud, not\nnebulous and evanescent only, but brooding darkly, boding storms, such\nas the orange blossoms dread.\n\nHe walked again in the garden with Serafina, but Dona Mirana was never\nfar, and the glamour of the former evening, lit by one star, was driven\nfrom the garden by his anxieties about that castle of which he could\nnot speak. Serafina asked him of his home. He would not parry her\nquestion, and yet he could not tell her that all their future hung on\nthe promise of a man in an old leathern jacket calling himself a king.\nSo the mystery of his habitation deepened, spoiling the glamour of the\nevening. He spoke, instead, of the forest, hoping she might know\nsomething of that strange monarch to whom they dwelt so near; but she\nglanced uneasily towards Shadow Valley and told him that none in\nLowlight went that way. Sorrow grew heavier round Rodriguez' heart at\nthis: believing in the promise of a man whose eyes he trusted he had\nasked Serafina to marry him, and Serafina had said Yes; and now he\nfound she knew nothing of such a man, which seemed somehow to Rodriguez\nto weaken his promise, and, worst of all, she feared the place where he\nlived. He welcomed the approach of Dona Mirana, and all three returned\nto the house. For the rest of that evening he spoke little; but he had\nformed his project.\n\nWhen the two ladies retired Rodriguez, who had seemed tongue-tied for\nmany hours, turned to Don Alderon. His mother had told Don Alderon\nnothing yet; for she was troubled by the mystery of Rodriguez' castle,\nand would give him time to make it clear if he could; for there was\nsomething about Rodriguez of which with many pages I have tried to\nacquaint my reader but which was clear when first she saw him to Dona\nMirana. In fact she liked him at once, as I hope that perhaps by now my\nreader may. He turned to Don Alderon, who was surprised to see the\nvehemence with which his guest suddenly spoke after those hours of\nsilence, and Rodriguez told him the story of his love and the story of\nboth his castles, that which had vanished from the bank of the Ebro and\nthat which was promised him by the King of Shadow Valley. And often Don\nAlderon interrupted.\n\n\"Oh, Rodriguez,\" he said, \"you are welcome to our ancient, unfortunate\nhouse\": and later he said, \"I have met no man that had a prettier way\nwith the sword.\"\n\nBut Rodriguez held on to the end, telling all he had to tell; and\nespecially that he was landless and penniless but for that one promise;\nand as for the sword, he said, he was but as a child playing before the\nsword of Don Alderon. And this Don Alderon said was in no wise so,\nthough there were a few cunning passes that he had learned, hoping that\nthe day might come for him to do God a service thereby by slaying some\nof the Moors: and heartily he gave his consent and felicitation. But\nthis Rodriguez would not have: \"Come with me,\" he said, \"to the forest\nto the place where I met this man, and if we find him not there we will\ngo to the house in which his bowmen feast and there have news of him,\nand he shall show us the castle of his promise and, if it be such a\ncastle as you approve, then your consent shall be given, but if not ...\"\n\n\"Gladly indeed,\" said Don Alderon. \"We will start tomorrow.\"\n\nAnd Rodriguez took his words literally, though his host had meant no\nmore than what we should call \"one of these days,\" but Rodriguez was\nbeing consumed with a great impatience. And so they arranged it, and\nDon Alderon went to bed with a feeling, which is favourable to dreams,\nthat on the next day they went upon an adventure; for neither he nor\nanyone in that village had entered Shadow Valley.\n\nOnce more next morning Rodriguez walked with Serafina, with something\nof the romance of the garden gone, for Dona Mirana walked there too;\nand romance is like one of those sudden, wonderful colours that flash\nfor a moment out of a drop of dew; a passing shadow obscures them; and\nask another to see it, and the colour is not the same: move but a yard\nand the ray of enchantment is gone. Dona Mirana saw the romance of that\ngarden, but she saw it from thirty years away; it was all different\nwhat she saw, all changed from a certain day (for love was love in the\nold days): and to Rodriguez and Serafina it seemed that she could not\nsee romance at all, and somehow that dimmed it. Almost their eyes\nseemed to search amongst the azaleas for the romance of that other\nevening.\n\nAnd then Rodriguez told Serafina that he was riding away with her\nbrother to see about the affairs of his castle, and that they would\nreturn in a few days. Scarcely a hint he gave that those affairs might\nnot prosper, for he trusted the word of the King of Shadow Valley. His\nconfidence had returned: and soon, with swords at side and cloaks\nfloating brilliant on light winds of April, Rodriguez and Alderon rode\naway together.\n\nSoon in the distance they saw Shadow Valley. And then Rodriguez\nbethought him of Morano and of the foul wrong he committed against Don\nAlderon with his frying-pan, and how he was there in the camp to which\nhe was bringing his friend. And so he said: \"That vile knave Morano\nstill lives and insists on serving me.\"\n\n\"If he be near,\" said Don Alderon, \"I pray you to disarm him of his\nfrying-pan for the sake of my honour, which does not suffer me to be\nstricken with culinary weapons, but only with the sword, the lance, or\neven bolts of cannon or arquebuss ...\" He was thinking of yet more\nweapons when Rodriguez put spurs to his horse. \"He is near,\" he said;\n\"I will ride on and disarm him.\"\n\nSo Rodriguez came cantering into the forest while Don Alderon ambled a\nmile or so behind him.\n\nAnd there he found his old camp and saw Morano, sitting upon the ground\nby a small fire. Morano sprang up at once with joy in his eyes, his\nface wreathed with questions, which he did not put into words for he\ndid not pry openly into his master's affairs.\n\n\"Morano,\" said Rodriguez, \"give me your frying-pan.\"\n\n\"My frying-pan?\" said Morano.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rodriguez. And when he held in his hand that blackened,\ngreasy utensil he told Morano, \"That se\u00f1or you met in Lowlight rides\nwith me.\"\n\nThe cheerfulness faded out of Morano's face as light fades at sunset.\n\"Master,\" he said, \"he will surely slay me now.\"\n\n\"He will not slay you,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Master,\" Morano said, \"he hopes for my fat carcase as much as men hope\nfor the unicorn, when they wear their bright green coats and hunt him\nwith dogs in Spring.\" I know not what legend Morano stored in his mind,\nnor how much of it was true. \"And when he finds me without my\nfrying-pan he will surely slay me.\"\n\n\"That se\u00f1or,\" said Rodriguez emphatically, \"must not be hit with the\nfrying-pan.\"\n\n\"That is a hard rule, master,\" said Morano.\n\nAnd Rodriguez was indignant, when he heard that, that anyone should\nthus blaspheme against an obvious law of chivalry: while Morano's only\nthought was upon the injustice of giving up the sweets of life for the\nsake of a frying-pan. Thus they were at cross-purposes. And for some\nwhile they stood silent, while Rodriguez hung the reins of his horse\nover the broken branch of a tree. And then Don Alderon rode into the\nwood.\n\nAll then that was most pathetic in Morano's sense of injustice looked\nout of his eyes as he turned them upon his master. But Don Alderon\nscarcely glanced at all at Morano, even when he handed to him the reins\nof his horse as he walked on towards Rodriguez.\n\nAnd there in that leafy place they rested all through the evening, for\nthey had not started so early upon their journey as travellers should.\nEight days had gone since Rodriguez had left that small camp to ride to\nLowlight, and to the apex of his life towards which all his days had\nascended; and in that time Morano had collected good store of wood and,\nin little ways unthought of by dwellers in cities, had made the place\nlike such homes as wanderers find. Don Alderon was charmed with their\nroof of towering greenness, and with the choirs of those which\ninhabited it and which were now all coming home to sing. And at some\nmoment in the twilight, neither Rodriguez nor Alderon noticed when,\nMorano repossessed himself of his frying-pan, unbidden by Rodriguez,\nbut acting on a certain tacit permission that there seemed to be in the\ntwilight or in the mood of the two young men as they sat by the fire.\nAnd soon he was cooking once more, at a fire of his own, with something\nof the air that you see upon a Field Marshal's face who has lost his\nbaton and found it again. Have you ever noticed it, reader?\n\nAnd when the meal was ready Morano served it in silence, moving\nunobtrusively in the gloom of the wood; for he knew that he was\nforgiven, yet not so openly that he wished to insist on his presence or\neven to imply his possession of the weapon that fried the bacon. So,\nlike a dryad he moved from tree to tree, and like any fabulous creature\nwas gone again. And the two young men supped well, and sat on and on,\nwatching the sparks go up on innumerable journeys from the fire at\nwhich they sat, to be lost to sight in huge wastes of blackness and\nstars, lost to sight utterly, lost like the spirit of man to the gaze\nof our wonder when we try to follow its journey beyond the hearths that\nwe know.\n\nAll the next day they rode on through the forest, till they came to the\nblack circle of the old fire of their next camp. And here Rodriguez\nhalted on account of the attraction that one of his old camps seems to\nhave for a wanderer. It drew his feet towards it, this blackened\ncircle, this hearth that for one night made one spot in the wilderness\nhome. Don Alderon did not care whether they tarried or hurried; he\nloved his journey through this leafy land; the cool night-breeze\nslipping round the tree-trunks was new to him, and new was the\ncomradeship of the abundant stars; the quest itself was a joy to him;\nwith his fancy he built Rodriguez' mysterious castle no less\nmagnificently than did Don Alvidar. Sometimes they talked of the\ncastle, each of the young men picturing it as he saw it; but in the\nwarmth of the camp-fire after Morano slept they talked of more than\nthese chronicles can tell.\n\nIn the morning they pressed on as fast as the forest's low boughs would\nallow them. They passed somewhere near the great cottage in which the\nbowmen feasted; but they held on, as they had decided after discussion\nto do, for the last place in which Rodriguez had seen the King of\nShadow Valley, which was the place of his promise. And before any\ndimness came even to the forest, or golden shafts down colonnades which\nwere before all cathedrals, they found the old camp that they sought,\nwhich still had a clear flavour of magic for Morano on account of the\nmoth-like coming and going of his three horses after he had tied them\nto that tree. And here they looked for the King of Shadow Valley; and\nthen Rodriguez called him; and then all three of them called him,\nshouting \"King of Shadow Valley\" all together. No answer came: the\nwoods were without echo: nothing stirred but fallen leaves. But before\nthose miles of silence could depress them Rodriguez hit upon a simple\nplan, which was that he and Alderon should search all round, far from\nthe track, while Morano stayed in the camp and shouted frequently, and\nthey would not go out of hearing of his voice: for Shadow Valley had a\nreputation of being a bad forest for travellers to find their way\nthere; indeed, few ever attempted to. So they did as he said, he and\nAlderon searching in different directions, while Morano remained in the\ncamp, lifting a large and melancholy voice. And though rumour said it\nwas hard to find the way when twenty yards from the track in Shadow\nValley, it did not say it was hard to find the green bowmen: and\nRodriguez, knowing that they guarded the forest as the shadows of trees\nguard the coolness, was assured he would meet with some of them even\nthough he should miss their master. So he and Alderon searched till the\nforest darkness came and only birds on high branches still had light;\nand they never saw the King of Shadow Valley or any trace whatever of\nany man. And Alderon first returned to the encampment; but Rodriguez\nsearched on into the night, searching and calling through the darkness,\nand feeling, as every minute went by and every faint call of Morano,\nthat his castle was fading away, slipping past oak-tree and thorn-bush,\nto take its place among the unpitying stars. And when he returned at\nlast from his useless search he found Morano standing by a good fire,\nand the sight of it a little cheered Rodriguez, and the sight of the\nfirelight on Morano's face, and the homely comfort of the camp, for\neverything is comparative.\n\nAnd over their supper Rodriguez and Alderon agreed that they had come\nto a part of the forest too remote from the home of the King of Shadow\nValley, and decided to go the next day to the house of the green\nbowmen: and before he slept Rodriguez felt once more that all was well\nwith his castle.\n\nYet when the next day came they searched again, for Rodriguez\nremembered how it was to this very place that the King of Shadow Valley\nhad bidden him come in four weeks, and though this period was not yet\naccomplished, he felt, and Alderon fully agreed, they had waited long\nenough: so they searched all the morning, and then fulfilled their\ndecision of overnight by riding for the great cottage Rodriguez knew.\nAll the way they met no one. And Rodriguez' gaiety came back as they\nrode, for he and Don Alderon recognised more and more clearly that the\nbowmen's great cottage was the place they should have gone at first.\n\nIn early evening they were just at their journey's end; but barely had\nthey left the track that they had ridden the day before, barely taken\nthe smaller path that led after a few hundred yards to the cottage when\nthey found themselves stopped by huge chains that hung from tree to\ntree. High into the trees went the chains above their heads where they\nsat their horses, and a chain ran every six inches down to the very\nground: the road was well blocked.\n\nRodriguez and Alderon hastily consulted; then, leaving the horses with\nMorano, they followed the chains through dense forest to find a place\nwhere they could get the horses through. Finding the chains go on and\non and on, and as evening was drawing in, the two friends divided,\nAlderon going back and Rodriguez on, agreeing to meet again on the path\nwhere Morano was.\n\nIt was darkening when they met there, Rodriguez having found nothing\nbut that iron barrier going on from trunk to trunk, and Alderon having\nfound a great gateway of iron; but it was shut. Through the silent\nshadows stealing abroad at evening the three men crashed their way on\nfoot, leading their horses, towards this gate; but their way was slow\nand difficult for no path at all led up to it. It was dark when they\nreached it and they saw the high gate in the night, a black barrier\namong the trees where no one would wish to come, and in forest that\nseemed to these three to be nearly impenetrable. And what astonished\nRodriguez most of all was that the chains had not been across the path\nwhen he had feasted with the green bowmen.\n\nThey stood there gazing, all three, at the dark locked gate, and then\nthey saw two shields that met in the midst of it, and Rodriguez mounted\nhis horse and stretched up to feel what device there was on the beaten\niron; and both the shields were blank.\n\nThere they camped as well as men can when darkness has fallen before\nthey reach their camping-ground; and Morano lit a great fire before the\ngate, and the smooth blank shields touching shoulders there up above\nthem shone on Rodriguez and Alderon in the firelight. For a while they\nwondered at that strange gate that stood there dividing the wilderness;\nand then sleep came.\n\nAs soon as they woke they called loudly, but no one guarded that gate,\nno step but theirs stirred in the forest. Then, leaving Morano in the\ncamp with its great gate that led nowhere, the two young men climbed up\nby branches and chains, and were soon on the other side of the gate and\npressing on through the silence of the forest to find the cottage in\nwhich Rodriguez had slept. And almost at once the green bowmen\nappeared, ten of them with their bows, in front of Rodriguez and\nAlderon. \"Stop,\" said the ten green bowmen. When the bowmen said that,\nthere was nothing else to do.\n\n\"What do you seek?\" said the bowmen.\n\n\"The King of Shadow Valley,\" answered Rodriguez.\n\n\"He is not here,\" they said.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Rodriguez.\n\n\"He is nowhere,\" said one, \"when he does not wish to be seen.\"\n\n\"Then show me the castle that he promised me,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"We know nothing of any castle,\" said one of the bowmen, and they all\nshook their heads.\n\n\"No castle?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"No,\" they said.\n\n\"Has the King of Shadow Valley no castle?\" he asked, beginning now to\ndespair.\n\n\"We know of none,\" they said. \"He lives in the forest.\"\n\nBefore Rodriguez quite despaired he asked each one if they knew not of\nany castle of which their King was possessed; and each of them said\nthat there was no castle in all Shadow Valley. The ten still stood in\nfront of them with their bows: and Rodriguez turned away then indeed in\ndespair, and walked slowly back to the camp, and Alderon walked behind\nhim. In silence they reached their camp by the great gate that led\nnowhere, and there Rodriguez sat down on a log beside the dwindling\nfire, gazing at the grey ashes and thinking of his dead hopes. He had\nnot the heart to speak to Alderon, and the silence was unbroken by\nMorano who, for all his loquacity, knew when his words were not\nwelcome. Don Alderon tried to break that melancholy silence, saying\nthat these ten bowmen did not know the whole world; but he could not\ncheer Rodriguez. For, sitting there in dejection on his log, thinking\nof all the assurance with which he had often spoken of his castle,\nthere was one more thing to trouble him than Don Alderon knew. And this\nwas that when the bowmen had appeared he had hung once more round his\nneck that golden badge that was worked for him by the King of Shadow\nValley; and they must have seen it, and they had paid no heed to it\nwhatever: its magic was wholly departed. And one thing troubled him\nthat Rodriguez did not know, a very potent factor in human sorrow: he\nhad left in the morning so eagerly that he had had no breakfast, and\nthis he entirely forgot and knew not how much of his dejection came\nfrom this cause, thinking that the loss of his castle was of itself\nenough.\n\nSo with downcast head he sat empty and hopeless, and the little camp\nwas silent.\n\nIn this mournful atmosphere while no one spoke, and no one seemed to\nwatch, stood, when at last Rodriguez raised his head, with folded arms\nbefore the gate to nowhere, the King of Shadow Valley. His face was\nsurly, as though the face of a ghost, called from important work among\nasteroids needing his care, by the trivial legerdemain of some foolish\nnovice. Rodriguez, looking into those angry eyes, wholly forgot it was\nhe that had a grievance. The silence continued. And then the King of\nShadow Valley spoke.\n\n\"When have I broken my word?\" he said.\n\nRodriguez did not know. The man was still looking at him, still\nstanding there with folded arms before the great gate, confronting him,\ndemanding some kind of answer: and Rodriguez had nothing to say.\n\n\"I came because you promised me the castle,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I did not bid you come here,\" the man with the folded arms answered.\n\n\"I went where you bade me,\" said Rodriguez, \"and you were not there.\"\n\n\"In four weeks, I said,\" answered the King angrily.\n\nAnd then Alderon spoke. \"Have you any castle for my friend?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" said the King of Shadow Valley.\n\n\"You promised him one,\" said Don Alderon.\n\nThe King of Shadow Valley raised with his left hand a horn that hung\nbelow his elbow by a green cord round his body. He made no answer to\nDon Alderon, but put the horn against his lips and blew. They watched\nhim all three in silence, till the silence was broken by many men\nmoving swiftly through covert, and the green bowmen appeared.\n\nWhen seven or eight were there he turned and looked at them. \"When have\nI broken my word?\" he said to his men.\n\nAnd they all answered him, \"Never!\"\n\nMore broke into sight through the bushes.\n\n\"Ask them\" he said. And Rodriguez did not speak.\n\n\"Ask them,\" he said again, \"when I have broken my word.\"\n\nStill Rodriguez and Alderon said nothing. And the bowmen answered them.\n\"He has never broken his word,\" every bowman said.\n\n\"You promised me a castle,\" said Rodriguez, seeing that man's fierce\neyes upon him still.\n\n\"Then do as I bid you,\" answered the King of Shadow Valley; and he\nturned round and touched the lock of the gates with some key that he\nhad. The gates moved open and the King went through.\n\nDon Alderon ran forward after him, and caught up with him as he strode\naway, and spoke to him, and the King answered. Rodriguez did not hear\nwhat they said, and never afterwards knew. These words he heard only,\nfrom the King of Shadow Valley as he and Don Alderon parted: \".... and\ntherefore, se\u00f1or, it were better for some holy man to do his blessed\nwork before we come.\" And the King of Shadow Valley passed into the\ndeeps of the wood.\n\nAs the great gates were slowly swinging to, Don Alderon came back\nthoughtfully. The gates clanged, clicked, and were shut again. The King\nof Shadow Valley and all his bowmen were gone.\n\nDon Alderon went to his horse, and Rodriguez and Morano did the same,\ndrawn by the act of the only man of the three that seemed to have made\nup his mind. Don Alderon led his horse back toward the path, and\nRodriguez followed with his. When they came to the path they mounted in\nsilence; and presently Morano followed them, with his blankets rolled\nup in front of him on his horse and his frying-pan slung behind him.\n\n\"Which way?\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Home,\" said Don Alderon.\n\n\"But I cannot go to your home,\" said Rodriguez.\n\n\"Come,\" said Don Alderon, as one whose plans were made. Rodriguez\nwithout a home, without plans, without hope, went with Don Alderon as\nthistledown goes with the warm wind. They rode through the forest till\nit grew all so dim that only a faint tinge of greenness lay on the dark\nleaves: above were patches of bluish sky like broken pieces of steel.\nAnd a star or two were out when they left the forest. And cantering on\nthey came to Lowlight when the Milky Way appeared.\n\nAnd there were Dona Mirana and Serafina in the hall to greet them as\nthey entered the door.\n\n\"What news?\" they asked.\n\nBut Rodriguez hung back; he had no news to give. It was Don Alderon\nthat went forward, speaking cheerily to Serafina, and afterwards to his\nmother, with whom he spoke long and anxiously, pointing toward the\nforest sometimes, almost, as Rodriguez thought, in fear.\n\nAnd a little later, when the ladies had retired, Don Alderon told\nRodriguez over the wine, with which he had tried to cheer his forlorn\ncompanion, that it was arranged that he should marry Serafina. And when\nRodriguez lamented that this was impossible he replied that the King of\nShadow Valley wished it. And when Rodriguez heard this his astonishment\nequalled his happiness, for he marvelled that Don Alderon should not\nonly believe that strange man's unsupported promise, but that he should\neven obey him as though he held him in awe.\n\nAnd on the next day Rodriguez spoke with Dona Mirana as they walked in\nthe glory of the garden. And Dona Mirana gave him her consent as Don\nAlderon had done: and when Rodriguez spoke humbly of postponement she\nglanced uneasily towards Shadow Valley, as though she too feared the\nstrange man who ruled over the forest which she had never entered.\n\nAnd so it was that Rodriguez walked with his lady, with the sweet\nSerafina in that garden again. And walking there they forgot the need\nof house or land, forgot Shadow Valley with its hopes and its doubts,\nand all the anxieties of the thoughts that we take for the morrow: and\nwhen evening came and the birds sang in azaleas, and the shadows grew\nsolemn and long, and winds blew cool from the blazing bed of the Sun,\ninto the garden now all strange and still, they forgot our Earth and,\nbeyond the mundane coasts, drifted on dreams of their own into aureate\nregions of twilight, to wander in lands wherein lovers walk briefly and\nonly once.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWELFTH CHRONICLE\n\nTHE BUILDING OF CASTLE RODRIGUEZ AND THE ENDING OF THESE CHRONICLES\n\n\nWhen the King of Shadow Valley met Rodriguez, for the first time in the\nforest, and gave him his promise and left him by his camp-fire, he went\nback some way towards the bowmen's cottage and blew his horn; and his\nhundred bowmen were about him almost at once. To these he gave their\norders and they went back, whence they had come, into the forest's\ndarkness. But he went to the bowmen's cottage and paced before it, a\ndark and lonely figure of the night; and wherever he paced the ground\nhe marked it with small sticks. And next morning the hundred bowmen\ncame with axes as soon as the earliest light had entered the forest,\nand each of them chose out one of the giant trees that stood before the\ncottage, and attacked it. All day they swung their axes against the\nforest's elders, of which nearly a hundred were fallen when evening\ncame. And the stoutest of these, great trunks that were four feet\nthrough, were dragged by horses to the bowmen's cottage and laid by the\nlittle sticks that the King of Shadow Valley had put overnight in the\nground. The bowmen's cottage and the kitchen that was in the wood\nbehind it, and a few trees that still stood, were now all enclosed by\nfour lines of fallen trees which made a large rectangle on the ground\nwith a small square at each of its corners. And craftsmen came, and\nsmoothed and hollowed the inner sides of the four rows of trees,\nworking far into the night. So was the first day's work accomplished\nand so was built the first layer of the walls of Castle Rodriguez.\n\nOn the next day the bowmen again felled a hundred trees; the top of the\nfirst layer was cut flat by carpenters; at evening the second layer was\nhoisted up after their under sides had been flattened to fit the layer\nbelow them; quantities more were cast in to make the floor when they\nhad been gradually smoothed and fitted: at the end of the second day a\nman could not see over the walls of Castle Rodriguez. And on the third\nday more craftsmen arrived, men from distant villages at the forest's\nedge, whence the King of Shadow Valley had summoned them; and they\ncarved the walls as they grew. And a hundred trees fell that day, and\nthe castle was another layer higher. And all the while a park was\ngrowing in the forest, as they felled the great trees; but the greatest\ntrees of all the bowmen spared, oaks that had stood there for ages and\nages of men; they left them to grip the earth for a while longer, for a\nfew more human generations.\n\nOn the fourth day the two windows at the back of the bowmen's cottage\nbegan to darken, and that evening Castle Rodriguez was fifteen feet\nhigh. And still the hundred bowmen hewed at the forest, bringing\nsunlight bright on to grass that was shadowed by oaks for ages. And at\nthe end of the fifth day they began to roof the lower rooms and make\ntheir second floor: and still the castle grew a layer a day, though the\nsecond storey they built with thinner trees that were only three feet\nthrough, which were more easily carried to their place by the pulleys.\nAnd now they began to heap up rocks in a mass of mortar against the\nwall on the outside, till a steep slope guarded the whole of the lower\npart of the castle against fire from any attacker if war should come\nthat way, in any of the centuries that were yet to be: and the deep\nwindows they guarded with bars of iron.\n\nThe shape of the castle showed itself clearly now, rising on each side\nof the bowmen's cottage and behind it, with a tower at each of its\ncorners. To the left of the old cottage the main doorway opened to the\ngreat hall, in which a pile of a few huge oaks was being transformed\ninto a massive stair. Three figures of strange men held up this ceiling\nwith their heads and uplifted hands, when the castle was finished; but\nas yet the carvers had only begun their work, so that only here and\nthere an eye peeped out, or a smile flickered, to give any expression\nto the curious faces of these fabulous creatures of the wood, which\nwere slowly taking their shape out of three trees whose roots were\nstill in the earth below the floor. In an upper storey one of these\ntrees became a tall cupboard; and the shelves and the sides and the\nback and the top of it were all one piece of oak.\n\nAll the interior of the castle was of wood, hollowed into alcoves and\npolished, or carved into figures leaning out from the walls. So vast\nwere the timbers that the walls, at a glance, seemed almost one piece\nof wood. And the centuries that were coming to Spain darkened the walls\nas they came, through autumnal shades until they were all black, as\nthough they all mourned in secret for lost generations; but they have\nnot yet crumbled.\n\nThe fireplaces they made with great square red tiles, which they also\nput in the chimneys amongst rude masses of mortar: and these great dark\nholes remained always mysterious to those that looked for mystery in\nthe family that whiled away the ages in that castle. And by every\nfireplace two queer carved creatures stood upholding the mantlepiece,\nwith mystery in their faces and curious limbs, uniting the hearth with\nfable and with tales told in the wood. Years after the men that carved\nthem were all dust the shadows of these creatures would come out and\ndance in the room, on wintry nights when all the lamps were gone and\nflames stole out and flickered above the smouldering logs.\n\nIn the second storey one great saloon ran all the length of the castle.\nIn it was a long table with eight legs that had carvings of roses\nrambling along its edges: the table and its legs were all of one piece\nwith the floor. They would never have hollowed the great trunk in time\nhad they not used fire. The second storey was barely complete on the\nday that Rodriguez and Don Alderon and Morano came to the chains that\nguarded the park. And the King of Shadow Valley would not permit his\ngift to be seen in anything less than its full magnificence, and had\ncommanded that no man in the world might enter to see the work of his\nbowmen and craftsmen until it should frown at all comers a castle\nformidable as any in Spain.\n\nAnd then they heaped up the mortar and rock to the top of the second\nstorey, but above that they let the timbers show, except where they\nfilled in plaster between the curving trunks: and the ages blackened\nthe timber in amongst the white plaster; but not a storm that blew in\nall the years that came, nor the moss of so many Springs, ever rotted\naway those beams that the forest had given and on which the bowmen had\nlaboured so long ago. But the castle weathered the ages and reached our\ndays, worn, battered even, by its journey through the long and\nsometimes troubled years, but splendid with the traffic that it had\nwith history in many gorgeous periods. Here Valdar the Excellent came\nonce in his youth. And Charles the Magnificent stayed a night in this\ncastle when on a pilgrimage to a holy place of the South.\n\nIt was here that Peter the Arrogant in his cups gave Africa, one Spring\nnight, to his sister's son. What grandeurs this castle has seen! What\nchronicles could be writ of it! But not these chronicles, for they draw\nnear their close, and they have yet to tell how the castle was built.\nOthers shall tell what banners flew from all four of its towers, adding\na splendour to the wind, and for what cause they flew. I have yet to\ntell of their building.\n\nThe second storey was roofed, and Castle Rodriguez still rose one layer\nday by day, with a hauling at pulleys and the work of a hundred men:\nand all the while the park swept farther into the forest.\n\nAnd the trees that grew up through the building were worked by the\ncraftsmen in every chamber into which they grew: and a great branch of\nthe hugest of them made a little crooked stair in an upper storey. On\nthe floors they laid down skins of beasts that the bowmen slew in the\nforest; and on the walls there hung all manner of leather, tooled and\ndyed as they had the art to do in that far-away period in Spain.\n\nWhen the third storey was finished they roofed the castle over, laying\nupon the huge rafters red tiles that they made of clay. But the towers\nwere not yet finished.\n\nAt this time the King of Shadow Valley sent a runner into Lowlight to\nshoot a blunt arrow with a message tied to it into Don Alderon's\ngarden, near to the door, at evening.\n\nAnd they went on building the towers above the height of the roof And\nnear the top of them they made homes for archers, little turrets that\nleaned like swallows' nests out from each tower, high places where they\ncould see and shoot and not be seen from below. And little narrow\npassages wound away behind perched battlements of stone, by which\narchers could slip from place to place, and shoot from here or from\nthere and never be known. So were built in that distant age the towers\nof Castle Rodriguez.\n\nAnd one day four weeks from the felling of the first oak, the period of\nhis promise being accomplished, the King of Shadow Valley blew his\nhorn. And standing by what had been the bowmen's cottage, now all shut\nin by sheer walls of Castle Rodriguez, he gathered his bowmen to him.\nAnd when they were all about him he gave them their orders. They were\nto go by stealth to the village of Lowlight, and were to be by daylight\nbefore the house of Don Alderon; and, whether wed or unwed, whether she\nfled or folk defended the house, to bring Dona Serafina of the Valley\nof Dawnlight to be the chatelaine of Castle Rodriguez.\n\nFor this purpose he bade them take with them a chariot that he thought\nmagnificent, though the mighty timbers that gave grandeur to Castle\nRodriguez had a cumbrous look in the heavy vehicle that was to the\nbowmen's eyes the triumphal car of the forest. So they took their bows\nand obeyed, leaving the craftsmen at their work in the castle, which\nwas now quite roofed over, towers and all. They went through the forest\nby little paths that they knew, going swiftly and warily in the\nbowmen's way: and just before nightfall they were at the forest's edge,\nthough they went no farther from it than its shadows go in the evening.\nAnd there they rested under the oak trees for the early part of the\nnight except those whose art it was to gather news for their king; and\nthree of those went into Lowlight and mixed with the villagers there.\n\nWhen white mists moved over the fields near dawn and wavered ghostly\nabout Lowlight, the green bowman moved with them. And just out of\nhearing of the village, behind wild shrubs that hid them, the bowmen\nthat were coming from the forest met the three that had spent the night\nin taverns of Lowlight. And the three told the hundred of the great\nwedding that there was to be in the Church of the Renunciation that\nmorning in Lowlight: and of the preparations that were made, and how\nholy men had come from far on mules, and had slept the night in the\nvillage, and the Bishop of Toledo himself would bless the bridegroom's\nsword. The bowmen therefore retired a little way and, moving through\nthe mists, came forward to points whence they could watch the church,\nwell concealed on the wild plain, which here and there gave up a field\nto man but was mostly the playground of wild creatures whose ways were\nthe bowmen's ways. And here they waited.\n\nThis was the wedding of Rodriguez and Serafina, of which gossips often\nspoke at their doors in summer evenings, old women mumbling of fair\nweddings that each had seen; and they had been children when they saw\nthis wedding; they were those that threw small handfuls of anemones on\nthe path before the porch. They told the tale of it till they could\ntell no more. It is the account of the last two or three of them, old,\nold women, that came at last to these chronicles, so that their tongues\nmay wag as it were a little longer through these pages although they\nhave been for so many centuries dead. And this is all that books are\nable to do.\n\nFirst there was bell-ringing and many voices, and then the voices\nhushed, and there came the procession of eight divines of Murcia, whose\nvestments were strange to Lowlight. Then there came a priest from the\nSouth, near the border of Andalusia, who overnight had sanctified the\nring. (It was he who had entertained Rodriguez when he first escaped\nfrom la Garda, and Rodriguez had sent for him now.) Each note of the\nbells came clear through the hush as they entered the church. And then\nwith suitable attendants the bishop strode by and they saw quite close\nthe blessed cope of Toledo. And the bridegroom followed him in, wearing\nhis sword, and Don Alderon went with him. And then the voices rose\nagain in the street: the bells rang on: they all saw Dona Mirana. The\nlittle bunches of bright anemones grew sticky in their hands: the bells\nseemed louder: cheering rose in the street and came all down it nearer.\nThen Dona Serafina walked past them with all her maids: and that is\nwhat the gossips chiefly remembered, telling how she smiled at them,\nand praising her dress, through those distant summer evenings. Then\nthere was music in the church. And afterwards the forest-people had\ncome. And the people screamed, for none knew what they would do. But\nthey bowed so low to the bride and bridegroom, and showed their great\nhunting bows so willingly to all who wished to see, that the people\nlost their alarm and only feared lest the Bishop of Toledo should blast\nthe merry bowmen with one of his curses.\n\nAnd presently the bride and bridegroom entered the chariot, and the\npeople cheered; and there were farewells and the casting of flowers;\nand the bishop blessed three of their bows; and a fat man sat beside\nthe driver with folded arms, wearing bright on his face a look of\nfoolish contentment; and the bowmen and bride and bridegroom all went\naway to the forest.\n\nFour huge white horses drew that bridal chariot, the bowmen ran beside\nit, and soon it was lost to sight of the girls that watched it from\nLowlight; but their memories held it close till their eyes could no\nlonger see to knit and they could only sit by their porches in fine\nweather and talk of the days that were.\n\nSo came Rodriguez and his bride to the forest; he silent, perplexed,\nwondering always to what home and what future he brought her; she\nknowing less than he and trusting more. And on the untended road that\nthe bowmen shared with stags and with rare, very venturous travellers,\nthe wheels of the woodland chariot sank so deep in the sandy earth that\nthe escort of bowmen needed seldom to run any more; and he who sat by\nthe driver climbed down and walked silent for once, perhaps awed by the\noccasion, though he was none other than Morano. Serafina was delighted\nwith the forest, but between Rodriguez and its beautiful grandeur his\nanxieties crowded thickly. He leaned over once from the chariot and\nasked one of the bowmen again about that castle; but the bowman only\nbowed and answered with a proverb of Spain, not easily carried so far\nfrom its own soil to thrive in our language, but signifying that the\nmorrow showeth all things. He was silent then, for he knew that there\nwas no way to a direct answer through those proverbs, and after a while\nperhaps there came to him some of Serafina's trustfulness. By evening\nthey came to a wide avenue leading to great gates.\n\nRodriguez did not know the avenue, he knew no paths so wide in Shadow\nValley; but he knew those gates. They were the gates of iron that led\nnowhere. But now an avenue went from them upon the other side, and\nopened widely into a park dotted with clumps of trees. And the two\ngreat iron shields, they too had changed with the changes that had\nbewitched the forest, for their surfaces that had glowed so\nunmistakably blank, side by side in the firelight, not many nights\nbefore, blazoned now the armorial bearings of Rodriguez upon the one\nand those of the house of Dawnlight upon the other. Through the opened\ngates they entered the young park that seemed to wonder at its own\nancient trees, where wild deer drifted away from them like shadows\nthrough the evening: for the bowmen had driven in deer for miles\nthrough the forest. They passed a pool where water-lilies lay in\nlanguid beauty for hundreds of summers, but as yet no flower peeped\ninto the water, for the pond was all hallowed newly.\n\nA clump of trees stood right ahead of their way; they passed round it;\nand Castle Rodriguez came all at once into view. Serafina gasped\njoyously. Rodriguez saw its towers, its turrets for archers, its\nguarded windows deep in the mass of stone, its solemn row of\nbattlements, but he did not believe what he saw. He did not believe\nthat here at last was his castle, that here was his dream fulfilled and\nhis journey done. He expected to wake suddenly in the cold in some\nlonely camp, he expected the Ebro to unfold its coils in the North and\nto come and sweep it away. It was but another strayed hope, he thought,\ntaking the form of dream. But Castle Rodriguez still stood frowning\nthere, and none of its towers vanished, or changed as things change in\ndreams; but the servants of the King of Shadow Valley opened the great\ndoor, and Serafina and Rodriguez entered, and all the hundred bowmen\ndisappeared.\n\nHere we will leave them, and let these Chronicles end. For whoever\nwould tell more of Castle Rodriguez must wield one of those ponderous\npens that hangs on the study wall in the house of historians. Great\ndays in the story of Spain shone on those iron-barred windows, and\nthings were said in its banqueting chamber and planned in its inner\nrooms that sometimes turned that story this way or that, as rocks turn\na young river. And as a traveller meets a mighty river at one of its\nbends, and passes on his path, while the river sweeps on to its estuary\nand the sea, so I leave the triumphs and troubles of that story which I\ntouched for one moment by the door of Castle Rodriguez.\n\nMy concern is but with Rodriguez and Serafina and to tell that they\nlived here in happiness; and to tell that the humble Morano found his\nhappiness too. For he became the magnificent steward of Castle\nRodriguez, the majordomo, and upon august occasions he wore as much red\nplush as he had ever seen in his dreams, when he saw this very event,\nsleeping by dying camp-fires. And he slept not upon straw but upon good\nheaps of wolf-skins. But pining a little in the second year of his\nsomewhat lonely splendour, he married one of the maidens of the forest,\nthe child of a bowman that hunted boars with their king. And all the\ngreen bowmen came and built him a house by the gates of the park,\nwhence he walked solemnly on proper occasions to wait upon his master.\nMorano, good, faithful man, come forward for but a moment out of the\nGolden Age and bow across all those centuries to the reader: say one\nfarewell to him in your Spanish tongue, though the sound of it be no\nlouder than the sound of shadows moving, and so back to the dim\nsplendour of the past, for the Se\u00f1or or Se\u00f1ora shall hear your name no\nmore.\n\nFor years Rodriguez lived a chieftain of the forest, owning the\noverlordship of the King of Shadow Valley, whom he and Serafina would\nentertain with all the magnificence of which their castle was capable\non such occasions as he appeared before the iron gates. They seldom saw\nhim. Sometimes they heard his horn as he went by. They heard his bowmen\nfollow. And all would pass and perhaps they would see none. But upon\noccasions he came. He came to the christening of the eldest son of\nRodriguez and Serafina, for whom he was godfather. He came again to see\nthe boy shoot for the first time with a bow. And later he came to give\nlittle presents, small treasures of the forest, to Rodriguez'\ndaughters; who treated him always, not as sole lord of that forest that\ntravellers dreaded, but as a friend of their very own that they had\nfound for themselves. He had his favourites among them and none quite\nknew which they were.\n\nAnd one day he came in his old age to give Rodriguez a message. And he\nspoke long and tenderly of the forest as though all its glades were\nsacred.\n\nAnd soon after that day he died, and was buried with the mourning of\nall his men in the deeps of Shadow Valley, where only Rodriguez and the\nbowmen knew. And Rodriguez became, as the old king had commanded, the\nruler of Shadow Valley and all its faithful men. With them he hunted\nand defended the forest, holding all its ways to be sacred, as the old\nking had taught. It is told how Rodriguez ruled the forest well.\n\nAnd later he made a treaty with the Spanish King acknowledging him sole\nLord of Spain, including Shadow Valley, saving that certain right\nshould pertain to the foresters and should be theirs for ever. And\nthese rights are written on parchment and sealed with the seal of\nSpain; and none may harm the forest without the bowmen's leave.\n\nRodriguez was made Duke of Shadow Valley and a Magnifico of the first\ndegree; though little he went with other hidalgos to Court, but lived\nwith his family in Shadow Valley, travelling seldom beyond the\nsplendour of the forest farther than Lowlight.\n\nThus he saw the glory of autumn turning the woods to fairyland: and\nwhen the stags were roaring and winter coming on he would take a\nboar-spear down from the wall and go hunting through the forest, whose\ntwigs were black and slender and still against the bright menace of\nwinter. Spring found him viewing the fields that his men had sown,\nalong the forest's edge, and finding in the chaunt of the myriad birds\na stirring of memories, a beckoning towards past days. In summer he\nwould see his boys and girls at play, running through shafts of\nsunlight that made leaves and grass like pale emeralds. He gave his\ndays to the forest and the four seasons. Thus he dwelt amidst\nsplendours such as History has never seen in any visit of hers to the\ncourts of men.\n\nOf him and Serafina it has been written and sung that they lived\nhappily ever after; and though they are now so many centuries dead, may\nthey have in the memories of such of my readers as will let them linger\nthere, that afterglow of life that remembrance gives, which is all that\nthere is on earth for those that walked it once and that walk the paths\nof their old haunts no more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Don Rodriguez, by \nEdward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, Baron, Dunsany\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DON RODRIGUEZ ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4282-8.txt or 4282-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/2/8/4282/\n\nProduced by Robert Rowe, Charles Franks and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
