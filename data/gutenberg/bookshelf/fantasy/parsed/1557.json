Only\na few months before, Richard II--weak, wicked, and treacherous--had been\ndethroned, and Henry IV declared King in his stead. But it was only a\nseeming peacefulness, lasting but for a little while; for though King\nHenry proved himself a just and a merciful man--as justice and mercy\nwent with the men of iron of those days--and though he did not care\nto shed blood needlessly, there were many noble families who had been\nbenefited by King Richard during his reign, and who had lost somewhat of\ntheir power and prestige from the coming in of the new King.\n\nAmong these were a number of great lords--the Dukes of Albemarle,\nSurrey, and Exeter, the Marquis of Dorset, the Earl of Gloucester, and\nothers--who had been degraded to their former titles and estates, from\nwhich King Richard had lifted them. These and others brewed a secret\nplot to take King Henry's life, which plot might have succeeded had not\none of their own number betrayed them.\n\nTheir plan had been to fall upon the King and his adherents, and to\nmassacre them during a great tournament, to be held at Oxford. But Henry\ndid not appear at the lists; whereupon, knowing that he had been lodging\nat Windsor with only a few attendants, the conspirators marched thither\nagainst him. In the mean time the King had been warned of the plot,\nso that, instead of finding him in the royal castle, they discovered\nthrough their scouts that he had hurried to London, whence he was\neven then marching against them at the head of a considerable army. So\nnothing was left them but flight. Some betook themselves one way, some\nanother; some sought sanctuary here, some there; but one and another,\nthey were all of them caught and killed.\n\nThe Earl of Kent--one time Duke of Surrey--and the Earl of\nSalisbury were beheaded in the market-place at Cirencester; Lord Le\nDespencer--once the Earl of Gloucester--and Lord Lumley met the same\nfate at Bristol; the Earl of Huntingdon was taken in the Essex fens,\ncarried to the castle of the Duke of Gloucester, whom he had betrayed\nto his death in King Richard's time, and was there killed by the castle\npeople. Those few who found friends faithful and bold enough to afford\nthem shelter, dragged those friends down in their own ruin.\n\nJust such a case was that of the father of the boy hero of this\nstory, the blind Lord Gilbert Reginald Falworth, Baron of Falworth and\nEasterbridge, who, though having no part in the plot, suffered through\nit ruin, utter and complete.\n\nHe had been a faithful counsellor and adviser to King Richard, and\nperhaps it was this, as much and more than his roundabout connection\nwith the plot, that brought upon him the punishment he suffered.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nMyles Falworth was but eight years of age at that time, and it was only\nafterwards, and when he grew old enough to know more of the ins and outs\nof the matter, that he could remember by bits and pieces the things that\nafterwards happened; how one evening a knight came clattering into the\ncourt-yard upon a horse, red-nostrilled and smeared with the sweat and\nfoam of a desperate ride--Sir John Dale, a dear friend of the blind\nLord.\n\nEven though so young, Myles knew that something very serious had\nhappened to make Sir John so pale and haggard, and he dimly remembered\nleaning against the knight's iron-covered knees, looking up into his\ngloomy face, and asking him if he was sick to look so strange. Thereupon\nthose who had been too troubled before to notice him, bethought\nthemselves of him, and sent him to bed, rebellious at having to go so\nearly.\n\nHe remembered how the next morning, looking out of a window high up\nunder the eaves, he saw a great troop of horsemen come riding into the\ncourtyard beneath, where a powdering of snow had whitened everything,\nand of how the leader, a knight clad in black armor, dismounted and\nentered the great hall door-way below, followed by several of the band.\n\nHe remembered how some of the castle women were standing in a frightened\ngroup upon the landing of the stairs, talking together in low voices\nabout a matter he did not understand, excepting that the armed men who\nhad ridden into the courtyard had come for Sir John Dale. None of the\nwomen paid any attention to him; so, shunning their notice, he ran off\ndown the winding stairs, expecting every moment to be called back again\nby some one of them.\n\nA crowd of castle people, all very serious and quiet, were gathered\nin the hall, where a number of strange men-at-arms lounged upon the\nbenches, while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stood\nguarding the great door, the butts of their weapons resting upon the\nground, and the staves crossed, barring the door-way.\n\nIn the anteroom was the knight in black armor whom Myles had seen from\nthe window. He was sitting at the table, his great helmet lying upon\nthe bench beside him, and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow. A\nclerk sat at the other end of the same table, with inkhorn in one hand\nand pen in the other, and a parchment spread in front of him.\n\nMaster Robert, the castle steward, stood before the knight, who every\nnow and then put to him a question, which the other would answer, and\nthe clerk write the answer down upon the parchment.\n\nHis father stood with his back to the fireplace, looking down upon the\nfloor with his blind eyes, his brows drawn moodily together, and the\nscar of the great wound that he had received at the tournament at\nYork--the wound that had made him blind--showing red across his\nforehead, as it always did when he was angered or troubled.\n\nThere was something about it all that frightened Myles, who crept to his\nfather's side, and slid his little hand into the palm that hung limp and\ninert. In answer to the touch, his father grasped the hand tightly,\nbut did not seem otherwise to notice that he was there. Neither did\nthe black knight pay any attention to him, but continued putting his\nquestions to Master Robert.\n\nThen, suddenly, there was a commotion in the hall without, loud voices,\nand a hurrying here and there. The black knight half arose, grasping a\nheavy iron mace that lay upon the bench beside him, and the next moment\nSir John Dale himself, as pale as death, walked into the antechamber. He\nstopped in the very middle of the room. \"I yield me to my Lord's grace\nand mercy,\" said he to the black knight, and they were the last words he\never uttered in this world.\n\nThe black knight shouted out some words of command, and swinging up the\niron mace in his hand, strode forward clanking towards Sir John, who\nraised his arm as though to shield himself from the blow. Two or three\nof those who stood in the hall without came running into the room with\ndrawn swords and bills, and little Myles, crying out with terror, hid\nhis face in his father's long gown.\n\nThe next instant came the sound of a heavy blow and of a groan, then\nanother blow and the sound of one falling upon the ground. Then the\nclashing of steel, and in the midst Lord Falworth crying, in a dreadful\nvoice, \"Thou traitor! thou coward! thou murderer!\"\n\nMaster Robert snatched Myles away from his father, and bore him out of\nthe room in spite of his screams and struggles, and he remembered just\none instant's sight of Sir John lying still and silent upon his face,\nand of the black knight standing above him, with the terrible mace in\nhis hand stained a dreadful red.\n\nIt was the next day that Lord and Lady Falworth and little Myles,\ntogether with three of the more faithful of their people, left the\ncastle.\n\nHis memory of past things held a picture for Myles of old Diccon Bowman\nstanding over him in the silence of midnight with a lighted lamp in his\nhand, and with it a recollection of being bidden to hush when he would\nhave spoken, and of being dressed by Diccon and one of the women,\nbewildered with sleep, shuddering and chattering with cold.\n\nHe remembered being wrapped in the sheepskin that lay at the foot of\nhis bed, and of being carried in Diccon Bowman's arms down the silent\ndarkness of the winding stair-way, with the great black giant shadows\nswaying and flickering upon the stone wall as the dull flame of the lamp\nswayed and flickered in the cold breathing of the night air.\n\nBelow were his father and mother and two or three others. A stranger\nstood warming his hands at a newly-made fire, and little Myles, as he\npeeped from out the warm sheepskin, saw that he was in riding-boots and\nwas covered with mud. He did not know till long years afterwards that\nthe stranger was a messenger sent by a friend at the King's court,\nbidding his father fly for safety.\n\nThey who stood there by the red blaze of the fire were all very still,\ntalking in whispers and walking on tiptoes, and Myles's mother hugged\nhim in her arms, sheepskin and all, kissing him, with the tears\nstreaming down her cheeks, and whispering to him, as though he could\nunderstand their trouble, that they were about to leave their home\nforever.\n\nThen Diccon Bowman carried him out into the strangeness of the winter\nmidnight.\n\nOutside, beyond the frozen moat, where the osiers, stood stark and stiff\nin their winter nakedness, was a group of dark figures waiting for them\nwith horses. In the pallid moonlight Myles recognized the well-known\nface of Father Edward, the Prior of St. Mary's.\n\nAfter that came a long ride through that silent night upon the\nsaddle-bow in front of Diccon Bowman; then a deep, heavy sleep, that\nfell upon him in spite of the galloping of the horses.\n\nWhen next he woke the sun was shining, and his home and his whole life\nwere changed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nFrom the time the family escaped from Falworth Castle that midwinter\nnight to the time Myles was sixteen years old he knew nothing of the\ngreat world beyond Crosbey-Dale. A fair was held twice in a twelvemonth\nat the market-town of Wisebey, and three times in the seven years old\nDiccon Bowman took the lad to see the sights at that place. Beyond these\nthree glimpses of the outer world he lived almost as secluded a life as\none of the neighboring monks of St. Mary's Priory.\n\nCrosbey-Holt, their new home, was different enough from Falworth or\nEasterbridge Castle, the former baronial seats of Lord Falworth. It was\na long, low, straw-thatched farm-house, once, when the church lands were\ndivided into two holdings, one of the bailiff's houses. All around were\nthe fruitful farms of the priory, tilled by well-to-do tenant holders,\nand rich with fields of waving grain, and meadow-lands where sheep and\ncattle grazed in flocks and herds; for in those days the church lands\nwere under church rule, and were governed by church laws, and there,\nwhen war and famine and waste and sloth blighted the outside world,\nharvests flourished and were gathered, and sheep were sheared and cows\nwere milked in peace and quietness.\n\nThe Prior of St. Mary's owed much if not all of the church's prosperity\nto the blind Lord Falworth, and now he was paying it back with a haven\nof refuge from the ruin that his former patron had brought upon himself\nby giving shelter to Sir John Dale.\n\nI fancy that most boys do not love the grinding of school life--the\nlessons to be conned, the close application during study hours. It is\nnot often pleasant to brisk, lively lads to be so cooped up. I wonder\nwhat the boys of to-day would have thought of Myles's training. With him\nthat training was not only of the mind, but of the body as well, and for\nseven years it was almost unremitting. \"Thou hast thine own way to\nmake in the world, sirrah,\" his father said more than once when the boy\ncomplained of the grinding hardness of his life, and to make one's way\nin those days meant a thousand times more than it does now; it meant not\nonly a heart to feel and a brain to think, but a hand quick and strong\nto strike in battle, and a body tough to endure the wounds and blows in\nreturn. And so it was that Myles's body as well as his mind had to be\ntrained to meet the needs of the dark age in which he lived.\n\nEvery morning, winter or summer, rain or shine he tramped away six long\nmiles to the priory school, and in the evenings his mother taught him\nFrench.\n\nMyles, being prejudiced in the school of thought of his day, rebelled\nnot a little at that last branch of his studies. \"Why must I learn that\nvile tongue?\" said he.\n\n\"Call it not vile,\" said the blind old Lord, grimly; \"belike, when thou\nart grown a man, thou'lt have to seek thy fortune in France land, for\nEngland is haply no place for such as be of Falworth blood.\" And in\nafter-years, true to his father's prediction, the \"vile tongue\" served\nhim well.\n\nAs for his physical training, that pretty well filled up the hours\nbetween his morning studies at the monastery and his evening studies\nat home. Then it was that old Diccon Bowman took him in hand, than whom\nnone could be better fitted to shape his young body to strength and his\nhands to skill in arms. The old bowman had served with Lord Falworth's\nfather under the Black Prince both in France and Spain, and in long\nyears of war had gained a practical knowledge of arms that few could\nsurpass. Besides the use of the broadsword, the short sword, the\nquarter-staff, and the cudgel, he taught Myles to shoot so skilfully\nwith the long-bow and the cross-bow that not a lad in the country-side\nwas his match at the village butts. Attack and defence with the lance,\nand throwing the knife and dagger were also part of his training.\n\nThen, in addition to this more regular part of his physical training,\nMyles was taught in another branch not so often included in the military\neducation of the day--the art of wrestling. It happened that a fellow\nlived in Crosbey village, by name Ralph-the-Smith, who was the greatest\nwrestler in the country-side, and had worn the champion belt for three\nyears. Every Sunday afternoon, in fair weather, he came to teach Myles\nthe art, and being wonderfully adept in bodily feats, he soon grew so\nquick and active and firm-footed that he could cast any lad under twenty\nyears of age living within a range of five miles.\n\n\"It is main ungentle armscraft that he learneth,\" said Lord Falworth one\nday to Prior Edward. \"Saving only the broadsword, the dagger, and the\nlance, there is but little that a gentleman of his strain may use.\nNeth'less, he gaineth quickness and suppleness, and if he hath true\nblood in his veins he will acquire knightly arts shrewdly quick when the\ntime cometh to learn them.\"\n\nBut hard and grinding as Myles's life was, it was not entirely without\npleasures. There were many boys living in Crosbey-Dale and the village;\nyeomen's and farmers' sons, to be sure, but, nevertheless, lads of his\nown age, and that, after all, is the main requirement for friendship in\nboyhood's world. Then there was the river to bathe in; there were the\nhills and valleys to roam over, and the wold and woodland, with their\nwealth of nuts and birds'-nests and what not of boyhood's treasures.\n\nOnce he gained a triumph that for many a day was very sweet under the\ntongue of his memory. As was said before, he had been three times to the\nmarket-town at fair-time, and upon the last of these occasions he had\nfought a bout of quarterstaff with a young fellow of twenty, and had\nbeen the conqueror. He was then only a little over fourteen years old.\n\nOld Diccon, who had gone with him to the fair, had met some cronies of\nhis own, with whom he had sat gossiping in the ale-booth, leaving Myles\nfor the nonce to shift for himself. By-and-by the old man had noticed\na crowd gathered at one part of the fair-ground, and, snuffing a fight,\nhad gone running, ale-pot in hand. Then, peering over the shoulders of\nthe crowd, he had seen his young master, stripped to the waist, fighting\nlike a gladiator with a fellow a head taller than himself. Diccon was\nabout to force his way through the crowd and drag them asunder, but a\nsecond look had showed his practised eye that Myles was not only holding\nhis own, but was in the way of winning the victory. So he had stood with\nthe others looking on, withholding himself from any interference and\nwhatever upbraiding might be necessary until the fight had been brought\nto a triumphant close. Lord Falworth never heard directly of the\nredoubtable affair, but old Diccon was not so silent with the common\nfolk of Crosbey-Dale, and so no doubt the father had some inkling of\nwhat had happened. It was shortly after this notable event that Myles\nwas formally initiated into squirehood. His father and mother, as was\nthe custom, stood sponsors for him. By them, each bearing a lighted\ntaper, he was escorted to the altar. It was at St. Mary's Priory, and\nPrior Edward blessed the sword and girded it to the lad's side. No\none was present but the four, and when the good Prior had given the\nbenediction and had signed the cross upon his forehead, Myles's mother\nstooped and kissed his brow just where the priest's finger had drawn the\nholy sign. Her eyes brimmed bright with tears as she did so. Poor\nlady! perhaps she only then and for the first time realized how big her\nfledgling was growing for his nest. Henceforth Myles had the right to\nwear a sword.\n\n\nMyles had ended his fifteenth year. He was a bonny lad, with brown face,\ncurling hair, a square, strong chin, and a pair of merry laughing\nblue eyes; his shoulders were broad; his chest was thick of girth; his\nmuscles and thews were as tough as oak.\n\nThe day upon which he was sixteen years old, as he came whistling home\nfrom the monastery school he was met by Diccon Bowman.\n\n\"Master Myles,\" said the old man, with a snuffle in his voice--\"Master\nMyles, thy father would see thee in his chamber, and bade me send thee\nto him as soon as thou didst come home. Oh, Master Myles, I fear me that\nbelike thou art going to leave home to-morrow day.\"\n\nMyles stopped short. \"To leave home!\" he cried.\n\n\"Aye,\" said old Diccon, \"belike thou goest to some grand castle to\nlive there, and be a page there and what not, and then, haply, a\ngentleman-at-arms in some great lord's pay.\"\n\n\"What coil is this about castles and lords and gentlemen-at-arms?\" said\nMyles. \"What talkest thou of, Diccon? Art thou jesting?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Diccon, \"I am not jesting. But go to thy father, and then\nthou wilt presently know all. Only this I do say, that it is like thou\nleavest us to-morrow day.\"\n\nAnd so it was as Diccon had said; Myles was to leave home the very\nnext morning. He found his father and mother and Prior Edward together,\nwaiting for his coming.\n\n\"We three have been talking it over this morning,\" said his father, \"and\nso think each one that the time hath come for thee to quit this poor\nhome of ours. An thou stay here ten years longer, thou'lt be no more fit\nto go then than now. To-morrow I will give thee a letter to my kinsman,\nthe Earl of Mackworth. He has thriven in these days and I have fallen\naway, but time was that he and I were true sworn companions, and\nplighted together in friendship never to be sundered. Methinks, as I\nremember him, he will abide by his plighted troth, and will give thee\nhis aid to rise in the world. So, as I said, to-morrow morning thou\nshalt set forth with Diccon Bowman, and shall go to Castle Devlen, and\nthere deliver this letter which prayeth him to give thee a place in his\nhousehold. Thou mayst have this afternoon to thyself to make read such\nthings as thou shalt take with thee. And bid me Diccon to take the gray\nhorse to the village and have it shod.\"\n\nPrior Edward had been standing looking out of the window. As Lord\nFalworth ended he turned.\n\n\"And, Myles,\" said he, \"thou wilt need some money, so I will give thee\nas a loan forty shillings, which some day thou mayst return to me an\nthou wilt. For this know, Myles, a man cannot do in the world without\nmoney. Thy father hath it ready for thee in the chest, and will give it\nthee to-morrow ere thou goest.\"\n\nLord Falworth had the grim strength of manhood's hard sense to upbear\nhim in sending his son into the world, but the poor lady mother had\nnothing of that to uphold her. No doubt it was as hard then as it is\nnow for the mother to see the nestling thrust from the nest to shift for\nitself. What tears were shed, what words of love were spoken to the only\nman-child, none but the mother and the son ever knew.\n\nThe next morning Myles and the old bowman rode away, and no doubt to\nthe boy himself the dark shadows of leave-taking were lost in the golden\nlight of hope as he rode out into the great world to seek his fortune.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nWHAT MYLES remembered of Falworth loomed great and grand and big, as\nthings do in the memory of childhood, but even memory could not make\nFalworth the equal of Devlen Castle, when, as he and Diccon Bowman rode\nout of Devlentown across the great, rude stone bridge that spanned the\nriver, he first saw, rising above the crowns of the trees, those\nhuge hoary walls, and the steep roofs and chimneys clustered thickly\ntogether, like the roofs and chimneys of a town.\n\nThe castle was built upon a plateau-like rise of ground, which was\nenclosed by the outer wall. It was surrounded on three sides by a\nloop-like bend of the river, and on the fourth was protected by a deep,\nbroad, artificial moat, almost as wide as the stream from which it was\nfed. The road from the town wound for a little distance along by the\nedge of this moat. As Myles and the old bowman galloped by, with the\nanswering echo of their horses' hoof-beats rattling back from the smooth\nstone face of the walls, the lad looked up, wondering at the height and\nstrength of the great ancient fortress. In his air-castle building Myles\nhad pictured the Earl receiving him as the son of his one-time comrade\nin arms--receiving him, perhaps, with somewhat of the rustic warmth that\nhe knew at Crosbey-Dale; but now, as he stared at those massive walls\nfrom below, and realized his own insignificance and the greatness of\nthis great Earl, he felt the first keen, helpless ache of homesickness\nshoot through his breast, and his heart yearned for Crosbey-Holt again.\n\nThen they thundered across the bridge that spanned the moat, and through\nthe dark shadows of the great gaping gate-way, and Diccon, bidding him\nstay for a moment, rode forward to bespeak the gate-keeper.\n\nThe gate-keeper gave the two in charge of one of the men-at-arms who\nwere lounging upon a bench in the archway, who in turn gave them into\nthe care of one of the house-servants in the outer court-yard. So,\nhaving been passed from one to another, and having answered many\nquestions, Myles in due time found himself in the outer waiting-room\nsitting beside Diccon Bowman upon a wooden bench that stood along the\nwall under the great arch of a glazed window.\n\nFor a while the poor country lad sat stupidly bewildered. He was aware\nof people coming and going; he was aware of talk and laughter sounding\naround him; but he thought of nothing but his aching homesickness and\nthe oppression of his utter littleness in the busy life of this great\ncastle.\n\nMeantime old Diccon Bowman was staring about him with huge interest,\nevery now and then nudging his young master, calling his attention now\nto this and now to that, until at last the lad began to awaken somewhat\nfrom his despondency to the things around. Besides those servants and\nothers who came and went, and a knot of six or eight men-at-arms with\nbills and pole-axes, who stood at the farther door-way talking together\nin low tones, now and then broken by a stifled laugh, was a group of\nfour young squires, who lounged upon a bench beside a door-way hidden by\nan arras, and upon them Myles's eyes lit with a sudden interest. Three\nof the four were about his own age, one was a year or two older, and\nall four were dressed in the black-and-yellow uniform of the house of\nBeaumont.\n\nMyles plucked the bowman by the sleeve. \"Be they squires, Diccon?\" said\nhe, nodding towards the door.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Diccon. \"Aye; they be squires.\"\n\n\"And will my station be with them?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Aye; an the Earl take thee to service, thou'lt haply be taken as\nsquire.\"\n\nMyles stared at them, and then of a sudden was aware that the young men\nwere talking of him. He knew it by the way they eyed him askance, and\nspoke now and then in one another's ears. One of the four, a gay young\nfellow, with long riding-boots laced with green laces, said a few words,\nthe others gave a laugh, and poor Myles, knowing how ungainly he must\nseem to them, felt the blood rush to his cheeks, and shyly turned his\nhead.\n\nSuddenly, as though stirred by an impulse, the same lad who had just\ncreated the laugh arose from the bench, and came directly across the\nroom to where Myles and the bowman sat.\n\n\"Give thee good-den,\" said he. \"What be'st thy name and whence comest\nthou, an I may make bold so to ask?\"\n\n\"My name is Myles Falworth,\" said Myles; \"and I come from Crosbey-Dale\nbearing a letter to my Lord.\"\n\n\"Never did I hear of Crosbey-Dale,\" said the squire. \"But what seekest\nhere, if so be I may ask that much?\"\n\n\"I come seeking service,\" said Myles, \"and would enter as an esquire\nsuch as ye be in my Lord's household.\"\n\nMyles's new acquaintance grinned. \"Thou'lt make a droll squire to wait\nin a Lord's household,\" said he. \"Hast ever been in such service?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I have only been at school, and learned Latin and\nFrench and what not. But Diccon Bowman here hath taught me use of arms.\"\n\nThe young squire laughed outright. \"By'r Lady, thy talk doth tickle\nme, friend Myles,\" said he. \"Think'st thou such matters will gain thee\nfooting here? But stay! Thou didst say anon that thou hadst a letter to\nmy Lord. From whom is it?\"\n\n\"It is from my father,\" said Myles. \"He is of noble blood, but fallen in\nestate. He is a kinsman of my Lord's, and one time his comrade in arms.\"\n\n\"Sayst so?\" said the other. \"Then mayhap thy chances are not so\nill, after all.\" Then, after a moment, he added: \"My name is Francis\nGascoyne, and I will stand thy friend in this matter. Get thy letter\nready, for my Lord and his Grace of York are within and come forth anon.\nThe Archbishop is on his way to Dalworth, and my Lord escorts him so far\nas Uppingham. I and those others are to go along. Dost thou know my Lord\nby sight?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I know him not.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell thee when he cometh. Listen!\" said he, as a confused\nclattering sounded in the court-yard without. \"Yonder are the horses\nnow. They come presently. Busk thee with thy letter, friend Myles.\"\n\nThe attendants who passed through the anteroom now came and went more\nhurriedly, and Myles knew that the Earl must be about to come forth.\nHe had hardly time to untie his pouch, take out the letter, and tie the\nstrings again when the arras at the door-way was thrust suddenly aside,\nand a tall thin squire of about twenty came forth, said some words to\nthe young men upon the bench, and then withdrew again. Instantly the\nsquires arose and took their station beside the door-way. A sudden hush\nfell upon all in the room, and the men-at-arms stood in a line against\nthe wall, stiff and erect as though all at once transformed to figures\nof iron. Once more the arras was drawn back, and in the hush Myles heard\nvoices in the other room.\n\n\"My Lord cometh,\" whispered Gascoyne in his ear, and Myles felt his\nheart leap in answer.\n\nThe next moment two noblemen came into the anteroom followed by a crowd\nof gentlemen, squires, and pages. One of the two was a dignitary of the\nChurch; the other Myles instantly singled out as the Earl of Mackworth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nHe was a tall man, taller even than Myles's father. He had a thin\nface, deep-set bushy eyebrows, and a hawk nose. His upper lip was clean\nshaven, but from his chin a flowing beard of iron-gray hung nearly to\nhis waist. He was clad in a riding-gown of black velvet that hung a\nlittle lower than the knee, trimmed with otter fur and embroidered with\nsilver goshawks--the crest of the family of Beaumont.\n\nA light shirt of link mail showed beneath the gown as he walked, and a\npair of soft undressed leather riding-boots were laced as high as the\nknee, protecting his scarlet hose from mud and dirt. Over his shoulders\nhe wore a collar of enamelled gold, from which hung a magnificent\njewelled pendant, and upon his fist he carried a beautiful Iceland\nfalcon.\n\nAs Myles stood staring, he suddenly heard Gascoyne's voice whisper in\nhis ear, \"Yon is my Lord; go forward and give him thy letter.\"\n\nScarcely knowing what he did, he walked towards the Earl like a machine,\nhis heart pounding within him and a great humming in his ears. As he\ndrew near, the nobleman stopped for a moment and stared at him, and\nMyles, as in a dream, kneeled, and presented the letter. The Earl took\nit in his hand, turned it this way and that, looked first at the bearer,\nthen at the packet, and then at the bearer again.\n\n\"Who art thou?\" said he; \"and what is the matter thou wouldst have of\nme?\"\n\n\"I am Myles Falworth,\" said the lad, in a low voice; \"and I come seeking\nservice with you.\"\n\nThe Earl drew his thick eyebrows quickly together, and shot a keen\nlook at the lad. \"Falworth?\" said he, sharply--\"Falworth? I know no\nFalworth!\"\n\n\"The letter will tell you,\" said Myles. \"It is from one once dear to\nyou.\"\n\nThe Earl took the letter, and handing it to a gentleman who stood near,\nbade him break the seal. \"Thou mayst stand,\" said he to Myles; \"needst\nnot kneel there forever.\" Then, taking the opened parchment again, he\nglanced first at the face and then at the back, and, seeing its length,\nlooked vexed. Then he read for an earnest moment or two, skipping from\nline to line. Presently he folded the letter and thrust it into the\npouch at his side. \"So it is, your Grace,\" said he to the lordly\nprelate, \"that we who have luck to rise in the world must ever suffer by\nbeing plagued at all times and seasons. Here is one I chanced to know a\ndozen years ago, who thinks he hath a claim upon me, and saddles me\nwith his son. I must e'en take the lad, too, for the sake of peace and\nquietness.\" He glanced around, and seeing Gascoyne, who had drawn near,\nbeckoned to him. \"Take me this fellow,\" said he, \"to the buttery, and\nsee him fed; and then to Sir James Lee, and have his name entered in the\ncastle books. And stay, sirrah,\" he added; \"bid me Sir James, if it may\nbe so done, to enter him as a squire-at-arms. Methinks he will be better\nserving so than in the household, for he appeareth a soothly rough cub\nfor a page.\"\n\nMyles did look rustic enough, standing clad in frieze in the midst of\nthat gay company, and a murmur of laughter sounded around, though he\nwas too bewildered to fully understand that he was the cause of the\nmerriment. Then some hand drew him back--it was Gascoyne's--there was a\nbustle of people passing, and the next minute they were gone, and\nMyles and old Diccon Bowman and the young squire were left alone in the\nanteroom.\n\nGascoyne looked very sour and put out. \"Murrain upon it!\" said he; \"here\nis good sport spoiled for me to see thee fed. I wish no ill to thee,\nfriend, but I would thou hadst come this afternoon or to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Methinks I bring trouble and dole to every one,\" said Myles, somewhat\nbitterly. \"It would have been better had I never come to this place,\nmethinks.\"\n\nHis words and tone softened Gascoyne a little. \"Ne'er mind,\" said the\nsquire; \"it was not thy fault, and is past mending now. So come and fill\nthy stomach, in Heaven's name.\"\n\nPerhaps not the least hard part of the whole trying day for Myles\nwas his parting with Diccon. Gascoyne and he had accompanied the old\nretainer to the outer gate, in the archway of which they now stood; for\nwithout a permit they could go no farther. The old bowman led by the\nbridle-rein the horse upon which Myles had ridden that morning. His own\nnag, a vicious brute, was restive to be gone, but Diccon held him in\nwith tight rein. He reached down, and took Myles's sturdy brown hand in\nhis crooked, knotted grasp.\n\n\"Farewell, young master,\" he croaked, tremulously, with a watery glimmer\nin his pale eyes. \"Thou wilt not forget me when I am gone?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles; \"I will not forget thee.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" said the old man, looking down at him, and shaking his head\nslowly from side to side; \"thou art a great tall sturdy fellow now, yet\nhave I held thee on my knee many and many's the time, and dandled thee\nwhen thou wert only a little weeny babe. Be still, thou devil's limb!\"\nhe suddenly broke off, reining back his restive raw-boned steed,\nwhich began again to caper and prance. Myles was not sorry for the\ninterruption; he felt awkward and abashed at the parting, and at the old\nman's reminiscences, knowing that Gascoyne's eyes were resting amusedly\nupon the scene, and that the men-at-arms were looking on. Certainly\nold Diccon did look droll as he struggled vainly with his vicious\nhigh-necked nag. \"Nay, a murrain on thee! an' thou wilt go, go!\" cried\nhe at last, with a savage dig of his heels into the animal's ribs,\nand away they clattered, the led-horse kicking up its heels as a final\nparting, setting Gascoyne fairly alaughing. At the bend of the road the\nold man turned and nodded his head; the next moment he had disappeared\naround the angle of the wall, and it seemed to Myles, as he stood\nlooking after him, as though the last thread that bound him to his\nold life had snapped and broken. As he turned he saw that Gascoyne was\nlooking at him.\n\n\"Dost feel downhearted?\" said the young squire, curiously.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, brusquely. Nevertheless his throat was tight and dry,\nand the word came huskily in spite of himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nTHE EARL of Mackworth, as was customary among the great lords in those\ndays, maintained a small army of knights, gentlemen, men-at-arms, and\nretainers, who were expected to serve him upon all occasions of need,\nand from whom were supplied his quota of recruits to fill such levies as\nmight be made upon him by the King in time of war.\n\nThe knights and gentlemen of this little army of horse and foot soldiers\nwere largely recruited from the company of squires and bachelors, as the\nyoung novitiate soldiers of the castle were called.\n\nThis company of esquires consisted of from eighty to ninety lads,\nranging in age from eight to twenty years. Those under fourteen years\nwere termed pages, and served chiefly the Countess and her waiting\ngentlewomen, in whose company they acquired the graces and polish of the\ntimes, such as they were. After reaching the age of fourteen the lads\nwere entitled to the name of esquire or squire.\n\nIn most of the great houses of the time the esquires were the especial\nattendants upon the Lord and Lady of the house, holding such positions\nas body-squires, cup-bearers, carvers, and sometimes the office of\nchamberlain. But Devlen, like some other of the princely castles of the\ngreatest nobles, was more like a military post or a fortress than an\nordinary household. Only comparatively few of the esquires could be\nused in personal attendance upon the Earl; the others were trained\nmore strictly in arms, and served rather in the capacity of a sort of\nbody-guard than as ordinary squires. For, as the Earl rose in power and\ninfluence, and as it so became well worth while for the lower nobility\nand gentry to enter their sons in his family, the body of squires became\nalmost cumbersomely large. Accordingly, that part which comprised the\nsquires proper, as separate from the younger pages, was divided into\nthree classes--first, squires of the body, who were those just past\npagehood, and who waited upon the Earl in personal service; second,\nsquires of the household, who, having regular hours assigned for\nexercise in the manual of arms, were relieved from personal service\nexcepting upon especial occasions; and thirdly and lastly, at the head\nof the whole body of lads, a class called bachelors--young men ranging\nfrom eighteen to twenty years of age. This class was supposed to\nexercise a sort of government over the other and younger squires--to\nkeep them in order as much as possible, to marshal them upon occasions\nof importance, to see that their arms and equipments were kept in good\norder, to call the roll for chapel in the morning, and to see that those\nnot upon duty in the house were present at the daily exercise at arms.\nOrders to the squires were generally transmitted through the bachelors,\nand the head of that body was expected to make weekly reports of affairs\nin their quarters to the chief captain of the body.\n\nFrom this overlordship of the bachelors there had gradually risen a\nsystem of fagging, such as is or was practised in the great English\npublic schools--enforced services exacted from the younger lads--which\nat the time Myles came to Devlen had, in the five or six years it had\nbeen in practice, grown to be an absolute though unwritten law of the\nbody--a law supported by all the prestige of long-continued usage. At\nthat time the bachelors numbered but thirteen, yet they exercised over\nthe rest of the sixty-four squires and pages a rule of iron, and were\ntaskmasters, hard, exacting, and oftentimes cruel.\n\nThe whole company of squires and pages was under the supreme command of\na certain one-eyed knight, by name Sir James Lee; a soldier seasoned by\nthe fire of a dozen battles, bearing a score of wounds won in fight and\ntourney, and withered by hardship and labor to a leather-like toughness.\nHe had fought upon the King's side in all the late wars, and had at\nShrewsbury received a wound that unfitted him for active service, so\nthat now he was fallen to the post of Captain of Esquires at Devlen\nCastle--a man disappointed in life, and with a temper imbittered by that\nfailure as well as by cankering pain.\n\nYet Perhaps no one could have been better fitted for the place he held\nthan Sir James Lee. The lads under his charge were a rude, rough, unruly\nset, quick, like their elders, to quarrel, and to quarrel fiercely, even\nto the drawing of sword or dagger. But there was a cold, iron sternness\nabout the grim old man that quelled them, as the trainer with a lash of\nsteel might quell a den of young wolves. The apartments in which he was\nlodged, with his clerk, were next in the dormitory of the lads, and\neven in the midst of the most excited brawlings the distant sound of his\nharsh voice, \"Silence, messieurs!\" would bring an instant hush to the\nloudest uproar.\n\nIt was into his grim presence that Myles was introduced by Gascoyne.\nSir James was in his office, a room bare of ornament or adornment or\nsuperfluous comfort of any sort--without even so much as a mat of rushes\nupon the cold stone pavement to make it less cheerless. The old one-eyed\nknight sat gnawing his bristling mustaches. To anyone who knew him it\nwould have been apparent that, as the castle phrase went, \"the devil sat\nastride of his neck,\" which meant that some one of his blind wounds was\naching more sorely than usual.\n\nHis clerk sat beside him, with account-books and parchment spread upon\nthe table, and the head squire, Walter Blunt, a lad some three or four\nyears older than Myles, and half a head taller, black-browed, powerfully\nbuilt, and with cheek and chin darkened by the soft budding of his\nadolescent beard, stood making his report.\n\nSir James listened in grim silence while Gascoyne told his errand.\n\n\"So, then, pardee, I am bid to take another one of ye, am I?\" he\nsnarled. \"As though ye caused me not trouble enow; and this one a cub,\nlooking a very boor in carriage and breeding. Mayhap the Earl thinketh I\nam to train boys to his dilly-dally household service as well as to use\nof arms.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Gascoyne, timidly, \"my Lord sayeth he would have this one\nentered direct as a squire of the body, so that he need not serve in the\nhousehold.\"\n\n\"Sayest so?\" cried Sir James, harshly. \"Then take thou my message back\nagain to thy Lord. Not for Mackworth--no, nor a better man than he--will\nI make any changes in my government. An I be set to rule a pack of boys,\nI will rule them as I list, and not according to any man's bidding.\nTell him, sirrah, that I will enter no lad as squire of the body without\nfirst testing an he be fit at arms to hold that place.\" He sat for a\nwhile glowering at Myles and gnawing his mustaches, and for the time\nno one dared to break the grim silence. \"What is thy name?\" said he,\nsuddenly. And then, almost before Myles could answer, he asked the head\nsquire whether he could find a place to lodge him.\n\n\"There is Gillis Whitlock's cot empty,\" said Blunt. \"He is in the\ninfirmary, and belike goeth home again when he cometh thence. The fever\nhath gotten into his bones, and--\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said the knight, interrupting him impatiently. \"Let him\ntake that place, or any other that thou hast. And thou, Jerome,\" said he\nto his clerk, \"thou mayst enter him upon the roll, though whether it be\nas page or squire or bachelor shall be as I please, and not as Mackworth\nbiddeth me. Now get ye gone.\"\n\n\"Old Bruin's wound smarteth him sore,\" Gascoyne observed, as the two\nlads walked across the armory court. He had good-naturedly offered to\nshow the new-comer the many sights of interest around the castle, and in\nthe hour or so of ramble that followed, the two grew from acquaintances\nto friends with a quickness that boyhood alone can bring about. They\nvisited the armory, the chapel, the stables, the great hall, the Painted\nChamber, the guard-house, the mess-room, and even the scullery and the\nkitchen, with its great range of boilers and furnaces and ovens. Last of\nall Myles's new friend introduced him to the armor-smithy.\n\n\"My Lord hath sent a piece of Milan armor thither to be repaired,\" said\nhe. \"Belike thou would like to see it.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, eagerly, \"that would I.\"\n\nThe smith was a gruff, good-natured fellow, and showed the piece of\narmor to Myles readily and willingly enough. It was a beautiful bascinet\nof inlaid workmanship, and was edged with a rim of gold. Myles scarcely\ndared touch it; he gazed at it with an unconcealed delight that warmed\nthe smith's honest heart.\n\n\"I have another piece of Milan here,\" said he. \"Did I ever show thee my\ndagger, Master Gascoyne?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the squire.\n\nThe smith unlocked a great oaken chest in the corner of the shop, lifted\nthe lid, and brought thence a beautiful dagger with the handle of ebony\nand silver-gilt, and a sheath of Spanish leather, embossed and gilt.\nThe keen, well-tempered blade was beautifully engraved and inlaid\nwith niello-work, representing a group of figures in a then popular\nsubject--the dance of Death. It was a weapon at once unique and\nbeautiful, and even Gascoyne showed an admiration scarcely less keen\nthan Myles's openly-expressed delight.\n\n\"To whom doth it belong?\" said he, trying the point upon his thumb nail.\n\n\"There,\" said the smith, \"is the jest of the whole, for it belongeth\nto me. Sir William Beauclerk bade me order the weapon through Master\nGildersworthy, of London town, and by the time it came hither, lo! he\nhad died, and so it fell to my hands. No one here payeth the price for\nthe trinket, and so I must e'en keep it myself, though I be but a poor\nman.\"\n\n\"How much dost thou hold it for?\" said Gascoyne.\n\n\"Seventeen shillings buyeth it,\" said the armorer, carelessly.\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Gascoyne, with a sigh; \"so it is to be poor, and not be\nable to have such things as one loveth and would fain possess. Seventeen\nshillings is nigh as much by half again as all my yearly wage.\"\n\nThen a sudden thought came to Myles, and as it came his cheeks glowed\nas hot as fire \"Master Gascoyne,\" said he, with gruff awkwardness,\n\"thou hast been a very good, true friend to me since I have come to this\nplace, and hast befriended me in all ways thou mightest do, and I, as\nwell I know, but a poor rustic clod. Now I have forty shillings by me\nwhich I may spend as I list, and so I do beseech thee that thou wilt\ntake yon dagger of me as a love-gift, and have and hold it for thy very\nown.\"\n\nGascoyne stared open-mouthed at Myles. \"Dost mean it?\" said he, at last.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, \"I do mean it. Master Smith, give him the blade.\"\n\nAt first the smith grinned, thinking it all a jest; but he soon saw that\nMyles was serious enough, and when the seventeen shillings were produced\nand counted down upon the anvil, he took off his cap and made Myles a\nlow bow as he swept them into his pouch. \"Now, by my faith and troth,\"\nquoth he, \"that I do call a true lordly gift. Is it not so, Master\nGascoyne?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Gascoyne, with a gulp, \"it is, in soothly earnest.\" And\nthereupon, to Myles's great wonderment, he suddenly flung his arms about\nhis neck, and, giving him a great hug, kissed him upon the cheek. \"Dear\nMyles,\" said he, \"I tell thee truly and of a verity I did feel warm\ntowards thee from the very first time I saw thee sitting like a poor oaf\nupon the bench up yonder in the anteroom, and now of a sooth I give thee\nassurance that I do love thee as my own brother. Yea, I will take the\ndagger, and will stand by thee as a true friend from this time forth.\nMayhap thou mayst need a true friend in this place ere thou livest long\nwith us, for some of us esquires be soothly rough, and knocks are more\nplenty here than broad pennies, so that one new come is like to have a\nhard time gaining a footing.\"\n\n\"I thank thee,\" said Myles, \"for thy offer of love and friendship, and\ndo tell thee, upon my part, that I also of all the world would like best\nto have thee for my friend.\"\n\nSuch was the manner In which Myles formed the first great friendship of\nhis life, a friendship that was destined to last him through many years\nto come. As the two walked back across the great quadrangle, upon which\nfronted the main buildings of the castle, their arms were wound across\none another's shoulders, after the manner, as a certain great writer\nsays, of boys and lovers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nA boy's life is of a very flexible sort. It takes but a little while for\nit to shape itself to any new surroundings in which it may be thrown, to\nmake itself new friends, to settle itself to new habits; and so it was\nthat Myles fell directly into the ways of the lads of Devlen. On his\nfirst morning, as he washed his face and hands with the other squires\nand pages in a great tank of water in the armory court-yard, he\npresently found himself splashing and dashing with the others, laughing\nand shouting as loud as any, and calling some by their Christian names\nas though he had known them for years instead of overnight. During\nchapel he watched with sympathetic delight the covert pranks of the\nyoungsters during the half-hour that Father Emmanuel droned his Latin,\nand with his dagger point he carved his own name among the many cut\ndeep into the back of the bench before him. When, after breakfast, the\nsquires poured like school-boys into the great armory to answer to the\nroll-call for daily exercise, he came storming in with the rest, beating\nthe lad in front of him with his cap.\n\nBoys are very keen to feel the influence of a forceful character. A lad\nwith a strong will is quick to reach his proper level as a greater or\nlesser leader among the others, and Myles was of just the masterful\nnature to make his individuality felt among the Devlen squires. He was\nquick enough to yield obedience upon all occasions to proper authority,\nbut would never bend an inch to the usurpation of tyranny. In the school\nat St. Mary's Priory at Crosbey-Dale he would submit without a murmur or\noffer of resistance to chastisement by old Father Ambrose, the\nregular teacher; but once, when the fat old monk was sick, and a great\nlong-legged strapping young friar, who had temporarily taken his place,\nundertook to administer punishment, Myles, with a wrestling trip, flung\nhim sprawling backward over a bench into the midst of a shoal of small\nboys amid a hubbub of riotous confusion. He had been flogged soundly\nfor it under the supervision of Prior Edward himself; but so soon as\nhis punishment was over, he assured the prior very seriously that should\nlike occasion again happen he would act in the same manner, flogging or\nno flogging.\n\nIt was this bold, outspoken spirit that gained him at once friends and\nenemies at Devlen, and though it first showed itself in what was but a\nlittle matter, nevertheless it set a mark upon him that singled him out\nfrom the rest, and, although he did not suspect it at the time, called\nto him the attention of Sir James Lee himself, who regarded him as a lad\nof free and frank spirit.\n\nThe first morning after the roll-call in the armory, as Walter Blunt,\nthe head bachelor, rolled up the slip of parchment, and the temporary\nsilence burst forth into redoubled noise and confusion, each lad arming\nhimself from a row of racks that stood along the wall, he beckoned Myles\nto him.\n\n\"My Lord himself hath spoken to Sir James Lee concerning thee,\" said he.\n\"Sir James maintaineth that he will not enter thee into the body till\nthou hast first practised for a while at the pels, and shown what thou\ncanst do at broadsword. Hast ever fought at the pel?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered Myles, \"and that every day of my life sin I became\nesquire four years ago, saving only Sundays and holy days.\"\n\n\"With shield and broadsword?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Myles, \"and sometimes with the short sword.\"\n\n\"Sir James would have thee come to the tilt-yard this morn; he himself\nwill take thee in hand to try what thou canst do. Thou mayst take the\narms upon yonder rack, and use them until otherwise bidden. Thou seest\nthat the number painted above it on the wall is seventeen; that will be\nthy number for the nonce.\"\n\nSo Myles armed himself from his rack as the others were doing from\ntheirs. The armor was rude and heavy, used to accustom the body to the\nweight of the iron plates rather than for any defence. It consisted of\na cuirass, or breastplate of iron, opening at the side with hinges, and\ncatching with hooks and eyes; epauliers, or shoulder-plates; arm-plates\nand leg-pieces; and a bascinet, or open-faced helmet. A great triangular\nshield covered with leather and studded with bosses of iron, and a heavy\nbroadsword, pointed and dulled at the edges, completed the equipment.\n\nThe practice at the pels which Myles was bidden to attend comprised the\nchief exercise of the day with the esquires of young cadet soldiers of\nthat time, and in it they learned not only all the strokes, cuts, and\nthrusts of sword-play then in vogue, but also toughness, endurance, and\nelastic quickness. The pels themselves consisted of upright posts of\nash or oak, about five feet six inches in height, and in girth somewhat\nthicker than a man's thigh. They were firmly planted in the ground, and\nupon them the strokes of the broadsword were directed.\n\nAt Devlen the pels stood just back of the open and covered tilting\ncourts and the archery ranges, and thither those lads not upon household\nduty were marched every morning excepting Fridays and Sundays, and were\nthere exercised under the direction of Sir James Lee and two assistants.\nThe whole company was divided into two, sometimes into three parties,\neach of which took its turn at the exercise, delivering at the word\nof command the various strokes, feints, attacks, and retreats as the\ninstructors ordered.\n\nAfter five minutes of this mock battle the perspiration began to pour\ndown the faces, and the breath to come thick and short; but it was not\nuntil the lads could absolutely endure no more that the order was given\nto rest, and they were allowed to fling themselves panting upon the\nground, while another company took its place at the triple row of posts.\n\nAs Myles struck and hacked at the pel assigned to him, Sir James Lee\nstood beside him watching him in grim silence. The lad did his best to\nshow the knight all that he knew of upper cut, under cut, thrust, and\nback-hand stroke, but it did not seem to him that Sir James was very\nwell satisfied with his skill.\n\n\"Thou fightest like a clodpole,\" said the old man. \"Ha, that stroke\nwas but ill-recovered. Strike me it again, and get thou in guard more\nquickly.\"\n\nMyles repeated the stroke.\n\n\"Pest!\" cried Sir James. \"Thou art too slow by a week. Here, strike thou\nthe blow at me.\"\n\nMyles hesitated. Sir James held a stout staff in his hand, but otherwise\nhe was unarmed.\n\n\"Strike, I say!\" said Sir James. \"What stayest thou for? Art afeard?\"\n\nIt was Myles's answer that set the seal of individuality upon him.\n\"Nay,\" said he, boldly, \"I am not afeard. I fear not thee nor any man!\"\nSo saying, he delivered the stroke at Sir James with might and main. It\nwas met with a jarring blow that made his wrist and arm tingle, and the\nnext instant he received a stroke upon the bascinet that caused his ears\nto ring and the sparks to dance and fly before his eyes.\n\n\"Pardee!\" said Sir James, grimly. \"An I had had a mace in my hand, I\nwould have knocked thy cockerel brains out that time. Thou mayst take\nthat blow for answering me so pertly. And now we are quits. Now strike\nme the stroke again an thou art not afeard.\"\n\nMyles's eyes watered in spite of himself, and he shut the lids tight to\nwink the dimness away. Nevertheless he spoke up undauntedly as before.\n\"Aye, marry, will I strike it again,\" said he; and this time he was\nable to recover guard quickly enough to turn Sir James's blow with his\nshield, instead of receiving it upon his head.\n\n\"So!\" said Sir James. \"Now mind thee of this, that when thou strikest\nthat lower cut at the legs, recover thyself more quickly. Now, then,\nstrike me it at the pel.\"\n\nGascoyne and other of the lads who were just then lying stretched out\nupon the grass beneath, a tree at the edge of the open court where stood\nthe pels, were interested spectators of the whole scene. Not one of them\nin their memory had heard Sir James so answered face to face as Myles\nhad answered him, and, after all, perhaps the lad himself would not\nhave done so had he been longer a resident in the squires' quarters at\nDevlen.\n\n\"By 'r Lady! thou art a cool blade, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, as they\nmarched back to the armory again. \"Never heard I one bespeak Sir James\nas thou hast done this day.\"\n\n\"And, after all,\" said another of the young squires, \"old Bruin was not\nso ill-pleased, methinks. That was a shrewd blow he fetched thee on the\ncrown, Falworth. Marry, I would not have had it on my own skull for a\nsilver penny.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nSo little does it take to make a body's reputation.\n\nThat night all the squires' quarters buzzed with the story of how the\nnew boy, Falworth, had answered Sir James Lee to his face without fear,\nand had exchanged blows with him hand to hand. Walter Blunt himself was\nmoved to some show of interest.\n\n\"What said he to thee, Falworth?\" asked he.\n\n\"He said naught,\" said Myles, brusquely. \"He only sought to show me how\nto recover from the under cut.\"\n\n\"It is passing strange that he should take so much notice of thee as to\nexchange blows with thee with his own hand. Haply thou art either very\nquick or parlous slow at arms.\"\n\n\"It is quick that he is,\" said Gascoyne, speaking up in his friend's\nbehalf. \"For the second time that Falworth delivered the stroke, Sir\nJames could not reach him to return; so I saw with mine own eyes.\"\n\nBut that very sterling independence that had brought Myles so creditably\nthrough this adventure was certain to embroil him with the rude,\nhalf-savage lads about him, some of whom, especially among the\nbachelors, were his superiors as well in age as in skill and training.\nAs said before, the bachelors had enforced from the younger boys a\nfagging sort of attendance on their various personal needs, and it was\nupon this point that Myles first came to grief. As it chanced, several\ndays passed before any demand was made upon him for service to the heads\nof the squirehood, but when that demand was made, the bachelors were\nvery quick to see that the boy who was bold enough to speak up to Sir\nJames Lee was not likely to be a willing fag for them.\n\n\"I tell thee, Francis,\" he said, as Gascoyne and he talked over the\nmatter one day--\"I tell thee I will never serve them. Prithee, what\nshame can be fouler than to do such menial service, saving for one's\nrightful Lord?\"\n\n\"Marry!\" quoth Gascoyne; \"I reason not of shame at this or that. All I\nknow is that others serve them who are haply as good and maybe better\nthan I be, and that if I do not serve them I get knocked i' th' head\ntherefore, which same goeth soothly against my stomach.\"\n\n\"I judge not for thee,\" said Myles. \"Thou art used to these castle\nways, but only I know that I will not serve them, though they be thirty\nagainst me instead of thirteen.\"\n\n\"Then thou art a fool,\" said Gascoyne, dryly.\n\nNow in this matter of service there was one thing above all others that\nstirred Myles Falworth's ill-liking. The winter before he had come to\nDevlen, Walter Blunt, who was somewhat of a Sybarite in his way, and who\nhad a repugnance to bathing in the general tank in the open armory court\nin frosty weather, had had Dick Carpenter build a trough in the corner\nof the dormitory for the use of the bachelors, and every morning it was\nthe duty of two of the younger squires to bring three pails of water to\nfill this private tank for the use of the head esquires. It was seeing\ntwo of his fellow-esquires fetching and carrying this water that Myles\ndisliked so heartily, and every morning his bile was stirred anew at the\nsight.\n\n\"Sooner would I die than yield to such vile service,\" said he.\n\nHe did not know how soon his protestations would be put to the test.\n\nOne night--it was a week or two after Myles had come to Devlen--Blunt\nwas called to attend the Earl at livery. The livery was the last meal of\nthe day, and was served with great pomp and ceremony about nine o'clock\nat night to the head of the house as he lay in bed. Curfew had not yet\nrung, and the lads in the squires' quarters were still wrestling and\nsparring and romping boisterously in and out around the long row of rude\ncots in the great dormitory as they made ready for the night. Six or\neight flaring links in wrought-iron brackets that stood out from the\nwall threw a great ruddy glare through the barrack-like room--a light of\nall others to romp by. Myles and Gascoyne were engaged in defending the\npassage-way between their two cots against the attack of three other\nlads, and Myles held his sheepskin coverlet rolled up into a ball and\nbalanced in his hand, ready for launching at the head of one of the\nothers so soon as it should rise from behind the shelter of a cot. Just\nthen Walter Blunt, dressed with more than usual care, passed by on his\nway to the Earl's house. He stopped for a moment and said, \"Mayhaps I\nwill not be in until late to-night. Thou and Falworth, Gascoyne, may\nfetch water to-morrow.\"\n\nThen he was gone. Myles stood staring after his retreating figure with\neyes open and mouth agape, still holding the ball of sheepskin balanced\nin his hand. Gascoyne burst into a helpless laugh at his blank,\nstupefied face, but the next moment he laid his hand on his friend's\nshoulder.\n\n\"Myles,\" he said, \"thou wilt not make trouble, wilt thou?\"\n\nMyles made no answer. He flung down his sheepskin and sat him gloomily\ndown upon the side of the cot.\n\n\"I said that I would sooner die than fetch water for them,\" said he.\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Gascoyne; \"but that was spoken in haste.\"\n\nMyles said nothing, but shook his head.\n\nBut, after all, circumstances shape themselves. The next morning when he\nrose up through the dark waters of sleep it was to feel some one shaking\nhim violently by the shoulder.\n\n\"Come!\" cried Gascoyne, as Myles opened his eyes--\"come, time passeth,\nand we are late.\"\n\nMyles, bewildered with his sudden awakening, and still fuddled with the\nfumes of sleep, huddled into his doublet and hose, hardly knowing what\nhe was doing; tying a point here and a point there, and slipping\nhis feet into his shoes. Then he hurried after Gascoyne, frowzy,\nhalf-dressed, and even yet only half-awake. It was not until he was\nfairly out into the fresh air and saw Gascoyne filling the three\nleathern buckets at the tank, that he fully awakened to the fact that he\nwas actually doing that hateful service for the bachelors which he had\nprotested he would sooner die than render.\n\nThe sun was just rising, gilding the crown of the donjon-keep with a\nflame of ruddy light. Below, among the lesser buildings, the day was\nstill gray and misty. Only an occasional noise broke the silence of the\nearly morning: a cough from one of the rooms; the rattle of a pot or\na pan, stirred by some sleepy scullion; the clapping of a door or a\nshutter, and now and then the crowing of a cock back of the long row of\nstables--all sounding loud and startling in the fresh dewy stillness.\n\n\"Thou hast betrayed me,\" said Myles, harshly, breaking the silence at\nlast. \"I knew not what I was doing, or else I would never have come\nhither. Ne'theless, even though I be come, I will not carry the water\nfor them.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Gascoyne, tartly. \"An thou canst not stomach it,\nlet be, and I will e'en carry all three myself. It will make me two\njourneys, but, thank Heaven, I am not so proud as to wish to get me\nhard knocks for naught.\" So saying, he picked up two of the buckets and\nstarted away across the court for the dormitory.\n\nThen Myles, with a lowering face, snatched up the third, and, hurrying\nafter, gave him his hand with the extra pail. So it was that he came to\ndo service, after all.\n\n\"Why tarried ye so long?\" said one of the older bachelors, roughly, as\nthe two lads emptied the water into the wooden trough. He sat on the\nedge of the cot, blowzed and untrussed, with his long hair tumbled and\ndisordered.\n\nHis dictatorial tone stung Myles to fury. \"We tarried no longer than\nneed be,\" answered he, savagely. \"Have we wings to fly withal at your\nbidding?\"\n\nHe spoke so loudly that all in the room heard him; the younger squires\nwho were dressing stared in blank amazement, and Blunt sat up suddenly\nin his cot.\n\n\"Why, how now?\" he cried. \"Answerest thou back thy betters so pertly,\nsirrah? By my soul, I have a mind to crack thy head with this clog for\nthy unruly talk.\"\n\nHe glared at Myles as he spoke, and Myles glared back again with right\ngood-will. Matters might have come to a crisis, only that Gascoyne and\nWilkes dragged their friend away before he had opportunity to answer.\n\n\"An ill-conditioned knave as ever I did see,\" growled Blunt, glaring\nafter him.\n\n\"Myles, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, almost despairingly, \"why wilt thou\nbreed such mischief for thyself? Seest thou not thou hast got thee\nthe ill-will of every one of the bachelors, from Wat Blunt to Robin de\nRamsey?\"\n\n\"I care not,\" said Myles, fiercely, recurring to his grievance. \"Heard\nye not how the dogs upbraided me before the whole room? That Blunt\ncalled me an ill-conditioned knave.\"\n\n\"Marry!\" said Gascoyne, laughing, \"and so thou art.\"\n\nThus it is that boldness may breed one enemies as well as gain one\nfriends. My own notion is that one's enemies are more quick to act than\none's friends.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nEvery one knows the disagreeable, lurking discomfort that follows a\nquarrel--a discomfort that imbitters the very taste of life for the time\nbeing. Such was the dull distaste that Myles felt that morning after\nwhat had passed in the dormitory. Every one in the proximity of such\nan open quarrel feels a reflected constraint, and in Myles's mind was a\ndisagreeable doubt whether that constraint meant disapproval of him or\nof his late enemies.\n\nIt seemed to him that Gascoyne added the last bitter twang to his\nunpleasant feelings when, half an hour later, they marched with the\nothers to chapel.\n\n\"Why dost thou breed such trouble for thyself, Myles?\" said he,\nrecurring to what he had already said. \"Is it not foolish for thee to\ncome hither to this place, and then not submit to the ways thereof, as\nthe rest of us do?\"\n\n\"Thou talkest not like a true friend to chide me thus,\" said Myles,\nsullenly; and he withdrew his arm from his friend's.\n\n\"Marry, come up!\" said Gascoyne; \"an I were not thy friend, I would let\nthee jog thine own way. It aches not my bones to have thine drubbed.\"\n\nJust then they entered the chapel, and words that might have led to a\nquarrel were brought to a close.\n\nMyles was not slow to see that he had the ill will of the head of their\ncompany. That morning in the armory he had occasion to ask some question\nof Blunt; the head squire stared coldly at him for a moment, gave him a\nshort, gruff answer, and then, turning his back abruptly, began talking\nwith one of the other bachelors. Myles flushed hot at the other's\ninsulting manner, and looked quickly around to see if any of the others\nhad observed what had passed. It was a comfort to him to see that all\nwere too busy arming themselves to think of anything else; nevertheless,\nhis face was very lowering as he turned away.\n\n\"Some day I will show him that I am as good a man as he,\" he muttered to\nhimself. \"An evil-hearted dog to put shame upon me!\"\n\nThe storm was brewing and ready to break.\n\n\nThat day was exceptionally hot and close, and permission had been asked\nby and granted to those squires not on duty to go down to the river for\na bath after exercise at the pels. But as Myles replaced his arms in\nthe rack, a little page came with a bidding to come to Sir James in his\noffice.\n\n\"Look now,\" said Myles, \"here is just my ill-fortune. Why might he not\nhave waited an hour longer rather than cause me to miss going with ye?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Gascoyne, \"let not that grieve thee, Myles. Wilkes and I\nwill wait for thee in the dormitory--will we not, Edmund? Make thou\nhaste and go to Sir James.\"\n\nSir James was sitting at the table studying over a scroll of parchment,\nwhen Myles entered his office and stood before him at the table.\n\n\"Well, boy,\" said he, laying aside the parchment and looking up at the\nlad, \"I have tried thee fairly for these few days, and may say that I\nhave found thee worthy to be entered upon the rolls as esquire of the\nbody.\"\n\n\"I give thee thanks, sir,\" said Myles.\n\nThe knight nodded his head in acknowledgement, but did not at once give\nthe word of dismissal that Myles had expected. \"Dost mean to write thee\na letter home soon?\" said he, suddenly.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, gaping in great wonderment at the strangeness of the\nquestion.\n\n\"Then when thou dost so write,\" said Sir James, \"give thou my deep\nregards to thy father.\" Then he continued, after a brief pause. \"Him did\nI know well in times gone by, and we were right true friends in hearty\nlove, and for his sake I would befriend thee--that is, in so much as is\nfitting.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Myles; but Sir James held up his hand, and he stopped short\nin his thanks.\n\n\"But, boy,\" said he, \"that which I sent for thee for to tell thee was of\nmore import than these. Dost thou know that thy father is an attainted\noutlaw?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" cried Myles, his cheeks blazing up as red as fire; \"who sayeth\nthat of him lieth in his teeth.\"\n\n\"Thou dost mistake me,\" said Sir James, quietly. \"It is sometimes no\nshame to be outlawed and banned. Had it been so, I would not have told\nthee thereof, nor have bidden thee send my true love to thy father, as\nI did but now. But, boy, certes he standest continually in great\ndanger--greater than thou wottest of. Were it known where he lieth hid,\nit might be to his undoing and utter ruin. Methought that belike thou\nmightest not know that; and so I sent for thee for to tell thee that it\nbehoovest thee to say not one single word concerning him to any of these\nnew friends of thine, nor who he is, nor what he is.\"\n\n\"But how came my father to be so banned?\" said Myles, in a constrained\nand husky voice, and after a long time of silence.\n\n\"That I may not tell thee just now,\" said the old knight, \"only\nthis--that I have been bidden to make it known to thee that thy father\nhath an enemy full as powerful as my Lord the Earl himself, and\nthat through that enemy all his ill-fortune--his blindness and\neverything--hath come. Moreover, did this enemy know where thy father\nlieth, he would slay him right speedily.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" cried Myles, violently smiting his open palm upon the table,\n\"tell me who this man is, and I will kill him!\"\n\nSir James smiled grimly. \"Thou talkest like a boy,\" said he. \"Wait until\nthou art grown to be a man. Mayhap then thou mayst repent thee of these\nbold words, for one time this enemy of thy father's was reckoned the\nforemost knight in England, and he is now the King's dear friend and a\ngreat lord.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Myles, after another long time of heavy silence, \"will not\nmy Lord then befriend me for the sake of my father, who was one time his\ndear comrade?\"\n\nSir James shook his head. \"It may not be,\" said he. \"Neither thou nor\nthy father must look for open favor from the Earl. An he befriended\nFalworth, and it came to be known that he had given him aid or succor,\nit might belike be to his own undoing. No, boy; thou must not even look\nto be taken into the household to serve with gentlemen as the other\nsquires do serve, but must even live thine own life here and fight thine\nown way.\"\n\nMyles's eyes blazed. \"Then,\" cried he, fiercely, \"it is shame and\nattaint upon my Lord the Earl, and cowardice as well, and never will I\nask favor of him who is so untrue a friend as to turn his back upon a\ncomrade in trouble as he turneth his back upon my father.\"\n\n\"Thou art a foolish boy,\" said Sir James with a bitter smile, \"and\nknowest naught of the world. An thou wouldst look for man to befriend\nman to his own danger, thou must look elsewhere than on this earth. Was\nI not one time Mackworth's dear friend as well as thy father? It could\ncost him naught to honor me, and here am I fallen to be a teacher of\nboys. Go to! thou art a fool.\"\n\nThen, after a little pause of brooding silence, he went on to say that\nthe Earl was no better or worse than the rest of the world. That men of\nhis position had many jealous enemies, ever seeking their ruin, and\nthat such must look first of all each to himself, or else be certainly\nruined, and drag down others in that ruin. Myles was silenced, but the\nbitterness had entered his heart, and abided with him for many a day\nafterwards.\n\nPerhaps Sir James read his feelings in his frank face, for he sat\nlooking curiously at him, twirling his grizzled mustache the while.\n\"Thou art like to have hard knocks of it, lad, ere thou hast gotten thee\nsafe through the world,\" said he, with more kindness in his harsh voice\nthan was usual. \"But get thee not into fights before thy time.\" Then he\ncharged the boy very seriously to live at peace with his fellow-squires,\nand for his father's sake as well as his own to enter into none of the\nbroils that were so frequent in their quarters.\n\nIt was with this special admonition against brawling that Myles was\ndismissed, to enter, before five minutes had passed, into the first\nreally great fight of his life.\n\n\nBesides Gascoyne and Wilkes, he found gathered in the dormitory six\nor eight of the company of squires who were to serve that day upon\nhousehold duty; among others, Walter Blunt and three other bachelors,\nwho were changing their coarse service clothes for others more fit for\nthe household.\n\n\"Why didst thou tarry so long, Myles?\" said Gascoyne, as he entered.\n\"Methought thou wert never coming.\"\n\n\"Where goest thou, Falworth?\" called Blunt from the other end of the\nroom, where he was lacing his doublet.\n\nJust now Myles had no heart in the swimming or sport of any sort, but he\nanswered, shortly, \"I go to the river to swim.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Blunt, \"thou goest not forth from the castle to-day. Hast\nthou forgot how thou didst answer me back about fetching the water\nthis morning? This day thou must do penance, so go thou straight to the\narmory and scour thou up my breastplate.\"\n\nFrom the time he had arisen that morning everything had gone wrong with\nMyles. He had felt himself already outrated in rendering service to\nthe bachelors, he had quarrelled with the head of the esquires, he had\nnearly quarrelled with Gascoyne, and then had come the bitterest and\nworst of all, the knowledge that his father was an outlaw, and that\nthe Earl would not stretch out a hand to aid him or to give him any\ncountenance. Blunt's words brought the last bitter cut to his heart,\nand they stung him to fury. For a while he could not answer, but stood\nglaring with a face fairly convulsed with passion at the young man, who\ncontinued his toilet, unconscious of the wrath of the new recruit.\n\nGascoyne and Wilkes, accepting Myles's punishment as a thing of course,\nwere about to leave the dormitory when Myles checked them.\n\n\"Stop, Francis!\" he cried, hoarsely. \"Thinkest thou that I will stay\nbehind to do yon dog's dirty work? No; I go with ye.\"\n\nA moment or two of dumb, silent amazement followed his bold words; then\nBlunt cried, \"Art thou mad?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" answered Myles in the same hoarse voice, \"I am not mad. I tell\nthee a better man than thou shouldst not stay me from going an I list to\ngo.\n\n\"I will break thy cockerel head for that speech,\" said Blunt, furiously.\nHe stooped as he spoke, and picked up a heavy clog that lay at his feet.\n\nIt was no insignificant weapon either. The shoes of those days were\nsometimes made of cloth, and had long pointed toes stuffed with tow or\nwool. In muddy weather thick heavy clogs or wooden soles were strapped,\nlike a skate, to the bottom of the foot. That clog which Blunt had\nseized was perhaps eighteen or twenty inches long, two or two and a half\ninches thick at the heel, tapering to a point at the toe. As the older\nlad advanced, Gascoyne stepped between him and his victim.\n\n\"Do not harm him, Blunt,\" he pleaded. \"Bear thou in mind how new-come he\nis among us. He knoweth not our ways as yet.\"\n\n\"Stand thou back, Gascoyne,\" said Blunt, harshly, as he thrust him\naside. \"I will teach him our ways so that he will not soon forget them.\"\n\nClose to Myles's feet was another clog like that one which Blunt held.\nHe snatched it up, and set his back against the wall, with a white face\nand a heart beating heavily and tumultuously, but with courage steeled\nto meet the coming encounter. There was a hard, grim look in his blue\neyes that, for a moment perhaps, quelled the elder lad. He hesitated.\n\"Tom! Wat! Ned!\" he called to the other bachelors, \"come hither, and\nlend me a hand with this knave.\"\n\n\"An ye come nigh me,\" panted Myles, \"I will brain the first within\nreach.\"\n\nThen Gascoyne dodged behind the others, and, without being seen, slipped\nout of the room for help.\n\nThe battle that followed was quick, sharp, and short. As Blunt strode\nforward, Myles struck, and struck with might and main, but he was too\nexcited to deliver his blow with calculation. Blunt parried it with the\nclog he held, and the next instant, dropping his weapon, gripped Myles\ntight about the body, pinning his arms to his sides.\n\nMyles also dropped the clog he held, and, wrenching out his right\narm with a sudden heave, struck Blunt full in the face, and then with\nanother blow sent him staggering back. It all passed in an instant; the\nnext the three other bachelors were upon him, catching him by the body,\nthe arms, the legs. For a moment or two they swayed and stumbled hither\nand thither, and then down they fell in a struggling heap.\n\nMyles fought like a wild-cat, kicking, struggling, scratching; striking\nwith elbows and fists. He caught one of the three by his collar, and\ntore his jacket open from the neck to the waist; he drove his foot into\nthe pit of the stomach of another, and knocked him breathless. The other\nlads not in the fight stood upon the benches and the beds around, but\nsuch was the awe inspired by the prestige of the bachelors that not one\nof them dared to lend hand to help him, and so Myles fought his fierce\nbattle alone.\n\nBut four to one were odds too great, and though Myles struggled as\nfiercely as ever, by-and-by it was with less and less resistance.\n\nBlunt had picked up the clog he had dropped when he first attacked the\nlad, and now stood over the struggling heap, white with rage, the blood\nrunning from his lip, cut and puffed where Myles had struck him, and\nmurder looking out from his face, if ever it looked out of the face of\nany mortal being.\n\n\"Hold him a little,\" said he, fiercely, \"and I will still him for you.\"\n\nEven yet it was no easy matter for the others to do his bidding, but\npresently he got his chance and struck a heavy, cruel blow at Myles's\nhead. Myles only partly warded it with his arm. Hitherto he had fought\nin silence, now he gave a harsh cry.\n\n\"Holy Saints!\" cried Edmund Wilkes. \"They will kill him.\"\n\nBlunt struck two more blows, both of them upon the body, and then at\nlast they had the poor boy down, with his face upon the ground and his\narms pinned to his sides, and Blunt, bracing himself for the stroke,\nwith a grin of rage raised a heavy clog for one terrible blow that\nshould finish the fight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\"How now, messieurs?\" said a harsh voice, that fell upon the turmoil\nlike a thunder-clap, and there stood Sir James Lee. Instantly the\nstruggle ceased, and the combatants scrambled to their feet.\n\nThe older lads stood silent before their chief, but Myles was deaf and\nblind and mad with passion, he knew not where he stood or what he said\nor did. White as death, he stood for a while glaring about him, catching\nhis breath convulsively. Then he screamed hoarsely.\n\n\"Who struck me? Who struck me when I was down? I will have his blood\nthat struck me!\" He caught sight of Blunt. \"It was he that struck me!\"\nhe cried. \"Thou foul traitor! thou coward!\" and thereupon leaped at his\nenemy like a wild-cat.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Sir James Lee, clutching him by the arm.\n\nMyles was too blinded by his fury to see who it was that held him. \"I\nwill not stop!\" he cried, struggling and striking at the knight. \"Let me\ngo! I will have his life that struck me when I was down!\"\n\nThe next moment he found himself pinned close against the wall, and\nthen, as though his sight came back, he saw the grim face of the old\none-eyed knight looking into his.\n\n\"Dost thou know who I am?\" said a stern, harsh voice.\n\nInstantly Myles ceased struggling, and his arms fell at his side. \"Aye,\"\nhe said, in a gasping voice, \"I know thee.\" He swallowed spasmodically\nfor a moment or two, and then, in the sudden revulsion of feeling, burst\nout sobbing convulsively.\n\nSir James marched the two off to his office, he himself walking\nbetween them, holding an arm of each, the other lads following behind,\nawe-struck and silent. Entering the office, Sir James shut the door\nbehind him, leaving the group of squires clustered outside about the\nstone steps, speculating in whispers as to what would be the outcome of\nthe matter.\n\nAfter Sir James had seated himself, the two standing facing him, he\nregarded them for a while in silence. \"How now, Walter Blunt,\" said he\nat last, \"what is to do?\"\n\n\"Why, this,\" said Blunt, wiping his bleeding lip. \"That fellow, Myles\nFalworth, hath been breeding mutiny and revolt ever sin he came hither\namong us, and because he was thus mutinous I would punish him therefor.\"\n\n\"In that thou liest!\" burst out Myles. \"Never have I been mutinous in my\nlife.\"\n\n\"Be silent, sir,\" said Sir James, sternly. \"I will hear thee anon.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, with his lips twitching and writhing, \"I will not be\nsilent. I am friendless here, and ye are all against me, but I will not\nbe silent, and brook to have lies spoken of me.\"\n\nEven Blunt stood aghast at Myles's boldness. Never had he heard any one\nso speak to Sir James before. He did not dare for the moment even to\nlook up. Second after second of dead stillness passed, while Sir James\nsat looking at Myles with a stern, terrifying calmness that chilled him\nin spite of the heat of his passion.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the old man at last, in a hard, quiet voice, \"thou dost know\nnaught of rules and laws of such a place as this. Nevertheless, it\nis time for thee to learn them. So I will tell thee now that if thou\nopenest thy lips to say only one single word more except at my bidding,\nI will send thee to the black vault of the donjon to cool thy hot\nspirits on bread and water for a week.\" There was something in the\nmeasured quietness of the old knight's tone that quelled Myles utterly\nand entirely. A little space of silence followed. \"Now, then, Blunt,\"\nsaid Sir James, turning to the bachelor, \"tell me all the ins and outs\nof this business without any more underdealing.\"\n\nThis time Blunt's story, though naturally prejudiced in his own favor,\nwas fairly true. Then Myles told his side of the case, the old knight\nlistening attentively.\n\n\"Why, how now, Blunt,\" said Sir James, when Myles had ended, \"I myself\ngave the lads leave to go to the river to bathe. Wherefore shouldst thou\nforbid one of them?\"\n\n\"I did it but to punish this fellow for his mutiny,\" said the bachelor.\n\"Methought we at their head were to have oversight concerning them.\"\n\n\"So ye are,\" said the knight; \"but only to a degree. Ere ye take it upon\nye to gainsay any of my orders or permits, come ye first to me. Dost\nthou understand?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered Blunt, sullenly.\n\n\"So be it, and now get thee gone,\" said the knight; \"and let me hear no\nmore of beating out brains with wooden clogs. An ye fight your battles,\nlet there not be murder in them. This is twice that the like hath\nhapped; gin I hear more of such doings--\" He did utter his threat, but\nstopped short, and fixed his one eye sternly upon the head squire. \"Now\nshake hands, and be ye friends,\" said he, abruptly.\n\nBlunt made a motion to obey, but Myles put his hand behind him.\n\n\"Nay, I shake not hands with any one who struck me while I was down.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said the knight, grimly. \"Now thou mayst go, Blunt. Thou,\nFalworth, stay; I would bespeak thee further.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said he, when the elder lad had left them, \"why wilt thou not\nserve these bachelors as the other squires do? Such is the custom here.\nWhy wilt thou not obey it?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Myles, \"I cannot stomach it, and they shall not make me\nserve them. An thou bid me do it, sir, I will do it; but not at their\ncommand.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the knight, \"I do not bid thee do them service. That lieth\nwith thee, to render or not, as thou seest fit. But how canst thou hope\nto fight single-handed against the commands of a dozen lads all older\nand mightier than thou?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said Myles; \"but were they an hundred, instead of\nthirteen, they should not make me serve them.\"\n\n\"Thou art a fool!\" said the old knight, smiling faintly, \"for that be'st\nnot courage, but folly. When one setteth about righting a wrong, one\ndriveth not full head against it, for in so doing one getteth naught but\nhard knocks. Nay, go deftly about it, and then, when the time is ripe,\nstrike the blow. Now our beloved King Henry, when he was the Earl of\nDerby, what could he have gained had he stood so against the old King\nRichard, brooking the King face to face? I tell thee he would have been\nknocked on the head as thou wert like to have been this day. Now were\nI thee, and had to fight a fight against odds, I would first get me\nfriends behind me, and then--\" He stopped short, but Myles understood\nhim well enough.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, with a gulp, \"I do thank thee for thy friendship, and\nask thy pardon for doing as I did anon.\"\n\n\"I grant thee pardon,\" said the knight, \"but tell thee plainly, an thou\ndost face me so again, I will truly send thee to the black cell for a\nweek. Now get thee away.\"\n\nAll the other lads were gone when Myles came forth, save only the\nfaithful Gascoyne, who sacrificed his bath that day to stay with his\nfriend; and perhaps that little act of self-denial moved Myles more than\nmany a great thing might have done.\n\n\"It was right kind of thee, Francis,\" said he, laying his hand\naffectionately on his friend's shoulder. \"I know not why thou lovest me\nso.\"\n\n\"Why, for one thing, this matter,\" answered his friend; \"because\nmethinks thou art the best fighter and the bravest one of all of us\nsquires.\"\n\nMyles laughed. Nevertheless Gascoyne's words were a soothing balm for\nmuch that had happened that day. \"I will fight me no more just now,\"\nsaid he; and then he told his friend all that Sir James had advised\nabout biding his time.\n\nGascoyne blew a long whistle. \"Beshrew me!\" quoth he, \"but methinks old\nBruin is on thy side of the quarrel, Myles. An that be so, I am with\nthee also, and others that I can name as well.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Myles. \"Then am I content to abide the time when we may\nbecome strong enough to stand against them.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nPerhaps there is nothing more delightful in the romance of boyhood than\nthe finding of some secret hiding-place whither a body may creep away\nfrom the bustle of the world's life, to nestle in quietness for an hour\nor two. More especially is such delightful if it happen that, by\npeeping from out it, one may look down upon the bustling matters of\nbusy every-day life, while one lies snugly hidden away unseen by any, as\nthough one were in some strange invisible world of one's own.\n\nSuch a hiding-place as would have filled the heart of almost any boy\nwith sweet delight Myles and Gascoyne found one summer afternoon. They\ncalled it their Eyry, and the name suited well for the roosting-place\nof the young hawks that rested in its windy stillness, looking down upon\nthe shifting castle life in the courts below.\n\nBehind the north stable, a great, long, rambling building, thick-walled,\nand black with age, lay an older part of the castle than that peopled\nby the better class of life--a cluster of great thick walls, rudely but\nstrongly built, now the dwelling-place of stable-lads and hinds, swine\nand poultry. From one part of these ancient walls, and fronting an inner\ncourt of the castle, arose a tall, circular, heavy-buttressed tower,\nconsiderably higher than the other buildings, and so mantled with a\ndense growth of aged ivy as to stand a shaft of solid green. Above its\ncrumbling crown circled hundreds of pigeons, white and pied, clapping\nand clattering in noisy flight through the sunny air. Several windows,\nsome closed with shutters, peeped here and there from out the leaves,\nand near the top of the pile was a row of arched openings, as though of\na balcony or an airy gallery.\n\nMyles had more than once felt an idle curiosity about this tower, and\none day, as he and Gascoyne sat together, he pointed his finger and\nsaid, \"What is yon place?\"\n\n\"That,\" answered Gascoyne, looking over his shoulder--\"that they call\nBrutus Tower, for why they do say that Brutus he built it when he came\nhither to Britain. I believe not the tale mine own self; ne'theless, it\nis marvellous ancient, and old Robin-the-Fletcher telleth me that there\nbe stairways built in the wall and passage-ways, and a maze wherein\na body may get lost, an he know not the way aright, and never see the\nblessed light of day again.\"\n\n\"Marry,\" said Myles, \"those same be strange sayings. Who liveth there\nnow?\"\n\n\"No one liveth there,\" said Gascoyne, \"saving only some of the stable\nvillains, and that half-witted goose-herd who flung stones at us\nyesterday when we mocked him down in the paddock. He and his wife and\nthose others dwell in the vaults beneath, like rabbits in any warren. No\none else hath lived there since Earl Robert's day, which belike was\nan hundred years agone. The story goeth that Earl Robert's brother--or\nstep-brother--was murdered there, and some men say by the Earl himself.\nSin that day it hath been tight shut.\"\n\nMyles stared at the tower for a while in silence. \"It is a\nstrange-seeming place from without,\" said he, at last, \"and mayhap it\nmay be even more strange inside. Hast ever been within, Francis?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Gascoyne; \"said I not it hath been fast locked since Earl\nRobert's day?\"\n\n\"By'r Lady,\" said Myles, \"an I had lived here in this place so long as\nthou, I wot I would have been within it ere this.\"\n\n\"Beshrew me,\" said Gascoyne, \"but I have never thought of such a\nmatter.\" He turned and looked at the tall crown rising into the warm\nsunlight with a new interest, for the thought of entering it smacked\npleasantly of adventure. \"How wouldst thou set about getting within?\"\nsaid he, presently.\n\n\"Why, look,\" said Myles; \"seest thou not yon hole in the ivy branches?\nMethinks there is a window at that place. An I mistake not, it is in\nreach of the stable eaves. A body might come up by the fagot pile to the\nroof of the hen-house, and then by the long stable to the north stable,\nand so to that hole.\"\n\nGascoyne looked thoughtfully at the Brutus Tower, and then suddenly\ninquired, \"Wouldst go there?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, briefly.\n\n\"So be it. Lead thou the way in the venture, I will follow after thee,\"\nsaid Gascoyne.\n\nAs Myles had said, the climbing from roof to roof was a matter easy\nenough to an active pair of lads like themselves; but when, by-and-by,\nthey reached the wall of the tower itself, they found the hidden window\nmuch higher from the roof than they had judged from below--perhaps ten\nor twelve feet--and it was, besides, beyond the eaves and out of their\nreach.\n\nMyles looked up and looked down. Above was the bushy thickness of the\nivy, the branches as thick as a woman's wrist, knotted and intertwined;\nbelow was the stone pavement of a narrow inner court between two of the\nstable buildings.\n\n\"Methinks I can climb to yon place,\" said he.\n\n\"Thou'lt break thy neck an thou tryest,\" said Gascoyne, hastily.\n\n\"Nay,\" quoth Myles, \"I trust not; but break or make, we get not there\nwithout trying. So here goeth for the venture.\"\n\n\"Thou art a hare-brained knave as ever drew breath of life,\" quoth\nGascoyne, \"and will cause me to come to grief some of these fine days.\nNe'theless, an thou be Jack Fool and lead the way, go, and I will be Tom\nFool and follow anon. If thy neck is worth so little, mine is worth no\nmore.\"\n\nIt was indeed a perilous climb, but that special providence which guards\nreckless lads befriended them, as it has thousands of their kind before\nand since. So, by climbing from one knotted, clinging stem to another,\nthey were presently seated snugly in the ivied niche in the window. It\nwas barred from within by a crumbling shutter, the rusty fastening of\nwhich, after some little effort upon the part of the two, gave way, and\nentering the narrow opening, they found themselves in a small triangular\npassage-way, from which a steep flight of stone steps led down through a\nhollow in the massive wall to the room below.\n\nAt the bottom of the steps was a heavy oaken door, which stood ajar,\nhanging upon a single rusty hinge, and from the room within a dull, gray\nlight glimmered faintly. Myles pushed the door farther open; it creaked\nand grated horribly on its rusty hinge, and, as in instant answer to\nthe discordant shriek, came a faint piping squeaking, a rustling and a\npattering of soft footsteps.\n\n\"The ghosts!\" cried Gascoyne, in a quavering whisper, and for a moment\nMyles felt the chill of goose-flesh creep up and down his spine. But the\nnext moment he laughed.\n\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"they be rats. Look at yon fellow, Francis! Be'st as big\nas Mother Joan's kitten. Give me that stone.\" He flung it at the rat,\nand it flew clattering across the floor. There was another pattering\nrustle of hundreds of feet, and then a breathless silence.\n\nThe boys stood looking around them, and a strange enough sight it was.\nThe room was a perfect circle of about twenty feet across, and was\npiled high with an indistinguishable mass of lumber--rude tables, ruder\nchairs, ancient chests, bits and remnants of cloth and sacking and\nleather, old helmets and pieces of armor of a by-gone time, broken\nspears and pole-axes, pots and pans and kitchen furniture of all sorts\nand kinds.\n\nA straight beam of sunlight fell through a broken shutter like a bar of\ngold, and fell upon the floor in a long streak of dazzling light that\nilluminated the whole room with a yellow glow.\n\n\"By 'r Lady!\" said Gascoyne at last, in a hushed voice, \"here is Father\nTime's garret for sure. Didst ever see the like, Myles? Look at yon\narbalist; sure Brutus himself used such an one!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles; \"but look at this saddle. Marry, here be'st a rat's\nnest in it.\"\n\nClouds of dust rose as they rummaged among the mouldering mass, setting\nthem coughing and sneezing. Now and then a great gray rat would shoot\nout beneath their very feet, and disappear, like a sudden shadow, into\nsome hole or cranny in the wall.\n\n\"Come,\" said Myles at last, brushing the dust from his jacket, \"an we\ntarry here longer we will have chance to see no other sights; the sun is\nfalling low.\"\n\nAn arched stair-way upon the opposite side of the room from which they\nhad entered wound upward through the wall, the stone steps being lighted\nby narrow slits of windows cut through the massive masonry. Above the\nroom they had just left was another of the same shape and size, but with\nan oak floor, sagging and rising into hollows and hills, where the joist\nhad rotted away beneath. It was bare and empty, and not even a rat\nwas to be seen. Above was another room; above that, another; all the\npassages and stairways which connected the one story with the other\nbeing built in the wall, which was, where solid, perhaps fifteen feet\nthick.\n\nFrom the third floor a straight flight of steps led upward to a closed\ndoor, from the other side of which shone the dazzling brightness of\nsunlight, and whence came a strange noise--a soft rustling, a melodious\nmurmur. The boys put their shoulders against the door, which was\nfastened, and pushed with might and main--once, twice; suddenly the\nlock gave way, and out they pitched headlong into a blaze of sunlight.\nA deafening clapping and uproar sounded in their ears, and scores of\npigeons, suddenly disturbed, rose in stormy flight.\n\nThey sat up and looked around them in silent wonder. They were in a\nbower of leafy green. It was the top story of the tower, the roof of\nwhich had crumbled and toppled in, leaving it open to the sky, with only\nhere and there a slanting beam or two supporting a portion of the tiled\nroof, affording shelter for the nests of the pigeons crowded closely\ntogether. Over everything the ivy had grown in a mantling sheet--a\nnet-work of shimmering green, through which the sunlight fell\nflickering.\n\n\"This passeth wonder,\" said Gascoyne, at last breaking the silence.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, \"I did never see the like in all my life.\" Then,\n\"Look, yonder is a room beyond; let us see what it is, Francis.\"\n\nEntering an arched door-way, the two found themselves in a beautiful\nlittle vaulted chapel, about eighteen feet long and twelve or fifteen\nwide. It comprised the crown of one of the large massive buttresses, and\nfrom it opened the row of arched windows which could be seen from below\nthrough the green shimmering of the ivy leaves. The boys pushed aside\nthe trailing tendrils and looked out and down. The whole castle lay\nspread below them, with the busy people unconsciously intent upon the\nmatters of their daily work. They could see the gardener, with bowed\nback, patiently working among the flowers in the garden, the stable-boys\nbelow grooming the horses, a bevy of ladies in the privy garden playing\nat shuttlecock with battledoors of wood, a group of gentlemen walking\nup and down in front of the Earl's house. They could see the household\nservants hurrying hither and thither, two little scullions at\nfisticuffs, and a kitchen girl standing in the door-way scratching her\nfrowzy head.\n\nIt was all like a puppetshow of real life, each acting unconsciously a\npart in the play. The cool wind came in through the rustling leaves and\nfanned their cheeks, hot with the climb up the winding stair-way.\n\n\"We will call it our Eyry,\" said Gascoyne \"and we will be the hawks that\nlive here.\" And that was how it got its name.\n\nThe next day Myles had the armorer make him a score of large spikes,\nwhich he and Gascoyne drove between the ivy branches and into the cement\nof the wall, and so made a safe passageway by which to reach the window\nniche in the wall.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nTHE TWO friends kept the secret of the Eyry to themselves for a little\nwhile, now and then visiting the old tower to rummage among the lumber\nstored in the lower room, or to loiter away the afternoon in the windy\nsolitudes of the upper heights. And in that little time, when the\nancient keep was to them a small world unknown to any but themselves--a\nworld far away above all the dull matters of every-day life--they talked\nof many things that might else never have been known to one another.\nMostly they spoke the crude romantic thoughts and desires of boyhood's\ntime--chaff thrown to the wind, in which, however, lay a few stray\nseeds, fated to fall to good earth, and to ripen to fruition in\nmanhood's day.\n\nIn the intimate talks of that time Myles imparted something of his\nhonest solidity to Gascoyne's somewhat weathercock nature, and to\nMyles's ruder and more uncouth character Gascoyne lent a tone of his\ngentler manners, learned in his pagehood service as attendant upon the\nCountess and her ladies.\n\nIn other things, also, the character and experience of the one lad\nhelped to supply what was lacking in the other. Myles was replete with\nold Latin gestes, fables, and sermons picked up during his school life,\nin those intervals of his more serious studies when Prior Edward had\npermitted him to browse in the greener pastures of the Gesta Romanorum\nand the Disciplina Clericalis of the monastery library, and Gascoyne was\nnever weary of hearing him tell those marvellous stories culled from the\ncrabbed Latin of the old manuscript volumes.\n\nUpon his part Gascoyne was full of the lore of the waiting-room and\nthe antechamber, and Myles, who in all his life had never known a lady,\nyoung or old, excepting his mother, was never tired of lying silently\nlistening to Gascoyne's chatter of the gay doings of the castle\ngentle-life, in which he had taken part so often in the merry days of\nhis pagehood.\n\n\"I do wonder,\" said Myles, quaintly, \"that thou couldst ever find the\ncourage to bespeak a young maid, Francis. Never did I do so, nor ever\ncould. Rather would I face three strong men than one young damsel.\"\n\nWhereupon Gascoyne burst out laughing. \"Marry!\" quoth he, \"they be\nno such terrible things, but gentle and pleasant spoken, and soft and\nsmooth as any cat.\"\n\n\"No matter for that,\" said Myles; \"I would not face one such for\nworlds.\"\n\nIt was during the short time when, so to speak, the two owned the\nsolitude of the Brutus Tower, that Myles told his friend of his father's\noutlawry and of the peril in which the family stood. And thus it was.\n\n\"I do marvel,\" said Gascoyne one day, as the two lay stretched in the\nEyry, looking down into the castle court-yard below--\"I do marvel, now\nthat thou art 'stablished here this month and more, that my Lord doth\nnever have thee called to service upon household duty. Canst thou riddle\nme why it is so, Myles?\"\n\nThe subject was a very sore one with Myles. Until Sir James had told him\nof the matter in his office that day he had never known that his father\nwas attainted and outlawed. He had accepted the change from their\nearlier state and the bald poverty of their life at Crosbey-Holt with\nthe easy carelessness of boyhood, and Sir James's words were the first\nto awaken him to a realization of the misfortunes of the house of\nFalworth. His was a brooding nature, and in the three or four weeks\nthat passed he had meditated so much over what had been told him, that\nby-and-by it almost seemed as if a shadow of shame rested upon his\nfather's fair fame, even though the attaint set upon him was unrighteous\nand unjust, as Myles knew it must be. He had felt angry and resentful\nat the Earl's neglect, and as days passed and he was not noticed in any\nway, his heart was at times very bitter.\n\nSo now Gascoyne's innocent question touched a sore spot, and Myles spoke\nwith a sharp, angry pain in his voice that made the other look quickly\nup. \"Sooner would my Lord have yonder swineherd serve him in the\nhousehold than me,\" said he.\n\n\"Why may that be, Myles?\" said Gascoyne.\n\n\"Because,\" answered Myles, with the same angry bitterness in his voice,\n\"either the Earl is a coward that feareth to befriend me, or else he is\na caitiff, ashamed of his own flesh and blood, and of me, the son of his\none-time comrade.\"\n\nGascoyne raised himself upon his elbow, and opened his eyes wide in\nwonder. \"Afeard of thee, Myles!\" quoth he. \"Why should he be afeared to\nbefriend thee? Who art thou that the Earl should fear thee?\"\n\nMyles hesitated for a moment or two; wisdom bade him remain silent\nupon the dangerous topic, but his heart yearned for sympathy and\ncompanionship in his trouble. \"I will tell thee,\" said he, suddenly,\nand therewith poured out all of the story, so far as he knew it, to his\nlistening, wondering friend, and his heart felt lighter to be thus eased\nof its burden. \"And now,\" said he, as he concluded, \"is not this Earl\na mean-hearted caitiff to leave me, the son of his one-time friend and\nkinsman, thus to stand or to fall alone among strangers and in a\nstrange place without once stretching me a helping hand?\" He waited, and\nGascoyne knew that he expected an answer.\n\n\"I know not that he is a mean-hearted caitiff, Myles,\" said he at last,\nhesitatingly. \"The Earl hath many enemies, and I have heard that he hath\nstood more than once in peril, having been accused of dealings with\nthe King's foes. He was cousin to the Earl of Kent, and I do remember\nhearing that he had a narrow escape at that time from ruin. There be\nmore reasons than thou wottest of why he should not have dealings with\nthy father.\"\n\n\"I had not thought,\" said Myles, bitterly, after a little pause, \"that\nthou wouldst stand up for him and against me in this quarrel, Gascoyne.\nHim will I never forgive so long as I may live, and I had thought that\nthou wouldst have stood by me.\"\n\n\"So I do,\" said Gascoyne, hastily, \"and do love thee more than any one\nin all the world, Myles; but I had thought that it would make thee feel\nmore easy, to think that the Earl was not against thee. And, indeed,\nfrom all thou has told me, I do soothly think that he and Sir James mean\nto befriend thee and hold thee privily in kind regard.\"\n\n\"Then why doth he not stand forth like a man and befriend me and my\nfather openly, even if it be to his own peril?\" said Myles, reverting\nstubbornly to what he had first spoken.\n\nGascoyne did not answer, but lay for a long while in silence. \"Knowest\nthou,\" he suddenly asked, after a while, \"who is this great enemy of\nwhom Sir James speaketh, and who seeketh so to drive thy father to\nruin?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I know not, for my father hath never spoken of these\nthings, and Sir James would not tell me. But this I know,\" said he,\nsuddenly, grinding his teeth together, \"an I do not hunt him out some\nday and slay him like a dog--\" He stopped abruptly, and Gascoyne,\nlooking askance at him, saw that his eyes were full of tears, whereupon\nhe turned his looks away again quickly, and fell to shooting pebbles out\nthrough the open window with his finger and thumb.\n\n\"Thou wilt tell no one of these things that I have said?\" said Myles,\nafter a while.\n\n\"Not I,\" said Gascoyne. \"Thinkest thou I could do such a thing?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, briefly.\n\nPerhaps this talk more than anything else that had ever passed between\nthem knit the two friends the closer together, for, as I have said,\nMyles felt easier now that he had poured out his bitter thoughts and\nwords; and as for Gascoyne, I think that there is nothing so flattering\nto one's soul as to be made the confidant of a stronger nature.\n\n\nBut the old tower served another purpose than that of a spot in which\nto pass away a few idle hours, or in which to indulge the confidences of\nfriendship, for it was there that Myles gathered a backing of strength\nfor resistance against the tyranny of the bachelors, and it is for that\nmore than for any other reason that it has been told how they found the\nplace and of what they did there, feeling secure against interruption.\n\nMyles Falworth was not of a kind that forgets or neglects a thing upon\nwhich the mind has once been set. Perhaps his chief objective since\nthe talk with Sir James following his fight in the dormitory had been\nsuccessful resistance to the exactions of the head of the body of\nsquires. He was now (more than a month had passed) looked upon by nearly\nif not all of the younger lads as an acknowledged leader in his own\nclass. So one day he broached a matter to Gascoyne that had for some\ntime been digesting in his mind. It was the formation of a secret order,\ncalling themselves the \"Knights of the Rose,\" their meeting-place to be\nthe chapel of the Brutus Tower, and their object to be the righting\nof wrongs, \"as they,\" said Myles, \"of Arthur his Round-table did right\nwrongs.\"\n\n\"But, prithee, what wrongs are there to right in this place?\" quoth\nGascoyne, after listening intently to the plan which Myles set forth.\n\n\"Why, first of all, this,\" said Myles, clinching his fists, as he had a\nhabit of doing when anything stirred him deeply, \"that we set those vile\nbachelors to their right place; and that is, that they be no longer our\nmasters, but our fellows.\"\n\nGascoyne shook his head. He hated clashing and conflict above all\nthings, and was for peace. Why should they thus rush to thrust\nthemselves into trouble? Let matters abide as they were a little longer;\nsurely life was pleasant enough without turning it all topsy-turvy.\nThen, with a sort of indignation, why should Myles, who had only come\namong them a month, take such service more to heart than they who had\nendured it for years? And, finally, with the hopefulness of so many of\nthe rest of us, he advised Myles to let matters alone, and they would\nright themselves in time.\n\nBut Myles's mind was determined; his active spirit could not brook\nresting passively under a wrong; he would endure no longer, and now or\nnever they must make their stand.\n\n\"But look thee, Myles Falworth,\" said Gascoyne, \"all this is not to\nbe done withouten fighting shrewdly. Wilt thou take that fighting upon\nthine own self? As for me, I tell thee I love it not.\"\n\n\"Why, aye,\" said Myles; \"I ask no man to do what I will not do myself.\"\n\nGascoyne shrugged his shoulders. \"So be it,\" said he. \"An thou hast\nappetite to run thy head against hard knocks, do it i' mercy's name! I\nfor one will stand thee back while thou art taking thy raps.\"\n\nThere was a spirit of drollery in Gascoyne's speech that rubbed against\nMyles's earnestness.\n\n\"Out upon it!\" cried he, his patience giving way. \"Seest not that I\nam in serious earnest? Why then dost thou still jest like Mad Noll, my\nLord's fool? An thou wilt not lend me thine aid in this matter, say so\nand ha' done with it, and I will bethink me of somewhere else to turn.\"\n\nThen Gascoyne yielded at once, as he always did when his friend lost his\ntemper, and having once assented to it, entered into the scheme heart\nand soul. Three other lads--one of them that tall thin squire Edmund\nWilkes, before spoken of--were sounded upon the subject. They also\nentered into the plan of the secret organization with an enthusiasm\nwhich might perhaps not have been quite so glowing had they realized how\nvery soon Myles designed embarking upon active practical operations.\nOne day Myles and Gascoyne showed them the strange things that they\nhad discovered in the old tower--the inner staircases, the winding\npassage-ways, the queer niches and cupboard, and the black shaft of a\nwell that pierced down into the solid wall, and whence, perhaps, the old\ncastle folk had one time drawn their supply of water in time of siege,\nand with every new wonder of the marvellous place the enthusiasm of the\nthree recruits rose higher and higher. They rummaged through the lumber\npile in the great circular room as Myles and Gascoyne had done, and at\nlast, tired out, they ascended to the airy chapel, and there sat cooling\nthemselves in the rustling freshness of the breeze that came blowing\nbriskly in through the arched windows.\n\nIt was then and there that the five discussed and finally determined\nupon the detailed plans of their organization, canvassing the names of\nthe squirehood, and selecting from it a sufficient number of bold and\ndaring spirits to make up a roll of twenty names in all.\n\nGascoyne had, as I said, entered into the matter with spirit, and\nperhaps it was owing more to him than to any other that the project\ncaught its delightful flavor of romance.\n\n\"Perchance,\" said he, as the five lads lay in the rustling stillness\nthrough which sounded the monotonous and ceaseless cooing of the\npigeons--\"perchance there may be dwarfs and giants and dragons and\nenchanters and evil knights and what not even nowadays. And who knows\nbut that if we Knights of the Rose hold together we may go forth into\nthe world, and do battle with them, and save beautiful ladies, and\nhave tales and gestes written about us as they are writ about the Seven\nChampions and Arthur his Round-table.\"\n\nPerhaps Myles, who lay silently listening to all that was said, was the\nonly one who looked upon the scheme at all in the light of real utility,\nbut I think that even with him the fun of the matter outweighed the\nserious part of the business.\n\nSo it was that the Sacred Order of the Twenty Knights of the Rose\ncame to be initiated. They appointed a code of secret passwords and\ncountersigns which were very difficult to remember, and which were only\nused when they might excite the curiosity of the other and uninitiated\nboys by their mysterious sound. They elected Myles as their Grand High\nCommander, and held secret meetings in the ancient tower, where many\nmysteries were soberly enacted.\n\nOf course in a day or two all the body of squires knew nearly everything\nconcerning the Knights of the Rose, and of their secret meetings in\nthe old tower. The lucky twenty were the objects of envy of all not so\nfortunate as to be included in this number, and there was a marked air\nof secrecy about everything they did that appealed to every romantic\nnotion of the youngsters looking on. What was the stormy outcome of it\nall is now presently to be told.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nThus it was that Myles, with an eye to open war with the bachelors,\ngathered a following to his support. It was some little while before\nmatters were brought to a crisis--a week or ten days. Perhaps even Myles\nhad no great desire to hasten matters. He knew that whenever war was\ndeclared, he himself would have to bear the brunt of the battle, and\neven the bravest man hesitates before deliberately thrusting himself\ninto a fight.\n\nOne morning Myles and Gascoyne and Wilkes sat under the shade of two\ntrees, between which was a board nailed to the trunks, making a rude\nbench--always a favorite lounging-place for the lads in idle moments.\nMyles was polishing his bascinet with lard and wood-ashes, rubbing the\nmetal with a piece of leather, and wiping it clean with a fustian rag.\nThe other two, who had just been relieved from household duty, lay at\nlength idly looking on.\n\nJust then one of the smaller pages, a boy of twelve or thirteen, by name\nRobin Ingoldsby, crossed the court. He had been crying; his face was red\nand blubbered, and his body was still shaken with convulsive sniffs.\n\nMyles looked up. \"Come hither, Robin,\" he called from where he sat.\n\"What is to do?\"\n\nThe little fellow came slowly up to where the three rested in the shade.\n\"Mowbray beat me with a strap,\" said he, rubbing his sleeve across his\neyes, and catching his breath at the recollection.\n\n\"Beat thee, didst say?\" said Myles, drawing his brows together. \"Why did\nhe beat thee?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Robin, \"I tarried overlong in fetching a pot of beer\nfrom the buttery for him and Wyatt.\" Then, with a boy's sudden and easy\nquickness in forgetting past troubles, \"Tell me, Falworth,\" said he,\n\"when wilt thou give me that knife thou promised me--the one thou break\nthe blade of yesterday?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said Myles, bluntly, vexed that the boy did not take\nthe disgrace of his beating more to heart. \"Some time soon, mayhap. Me\nthinks thou shouldst think more of thy beating than of a broken knife.\nNow get thee gone to thy business.\"\n\nThe youngster lingered for a moment or two watching Myles at his work.\n\"What is that on the leather scrap, Falworth?\" said he, curiously.\n\n\"Lard and ashes,\" said Myles, testily. \"Get thee gone, I say, or I\nwill crack thy head for thee;\" and he picked up a block of wood, with a\nthreatening gesture.\n\nThe youngster made a hideous grimace, and then scurried away, ducking\nhis head, lest in spite of Myles's well-known good-nature the block\nshould come whizzing after him.\n\n\"Hear ye that now!\" cried Myles, flinging down the block again and\nturning to his two friends. \"Beaten with straps because, forsooth, he\nwould not fetch and carry quickly enough to please the haste of these\nbachelors. Oh, this passeth patience, and I for one will bear it no\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Nay, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, soothingly, \"the little imp is as lazy as a\ndormouse and as mischievous as a monkey. I'll warrant the hiding was his\ndue, and that more of the like would do him good.\"\n\n\"Why, how dost thou talk, Francis!\" said Myles, turning upon him\nindignantly. \"Thou knowest that thou likest to see the boy beaten no\nmore than I.\" Then, after a meditative pause, \"How many, think ye, we\nmuster of our company of the Rose today?\"\n\nWilkes looked doubtfully at Gascoyne. \"There be only seventeen of us\nhere now,\" said he at last. \"Brinton and Lambourne are away to Roby\nCastle in Lord George's train, and will not be back till Saturday next.\nAnd Watt Newton is in the infirmary.\n\n\"Seventeen be'st enou,\" said Myles, grimly. \"Let us get together this\nafternoon, such as may, in the Brutus Tower, for I, as I did say, will\nno longer suffer these vile bachelors.\"\n\nGascoyne and Wilkes exchanged looks, and then the former blew a long\nwhistle.\n\nSo that afternoon a gloomy set of young faces were gathered together in\nthe Eyry--fifteen of the Knights of the Rose--and all knew why they were\nassembled. The talk which followed was conducted mostly by Myles. He\naddressed the others with a straightforward vim and earnestness, but the\nresponse was only half-hearted, and when at last, having heated himself\nup with his own fire, he sat down, puffing out his red cheeks and\nglaring round, a space of silence followed, the lads looked doubtfully\nat one another. Myles felt the chill of their silence strike coldly on\nhis enthusiasm, and it vexed him.\n\n\"What wouldst thou do, Falworth?\" said one of the knights, at last.\n\"Wouldst have us open a quarrel with the bachelors?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, gruffly. \"I had thought that ye would all lend me a\nhand in a pitched battle but now I see that ye ha' no stomach for that.\nNe'theless, I tell ye plainly I will not submit longer to the bachelors.\nSo now I will ask ye not to take any venture upon yourselves, but only\nthis: that ye will stand by me when I do my fighting, and not let five\nor seven of them fall upon me at once.\n\n\"There is Walter Blunt; he is parlous strong,\" said one of the others,\nafter a time of silence. \"Methinks he could conquer any two of us.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles; \"ye do fear him too greatly. I tell ye I fear not to\nstand up to try battle with him and will do so, too, if the need arise.\nOnly say ye that ye will stand by my back.\"\n\n\"Marry,\" said Gascoyne, quaintly, \"an thou wilt dare take the heavy end\nupon thee, I for one am willing to stand by and see that thou have thy\nfill of fighting.\"\n\n\"I too will stand thee by, Myles,\" said Edmund Wilkes.\n\n\"And I, and I, and I,\" said others, chiming in.\n\nThose who would still have held back were carried along by the stream,\nand so it was settled that if the need should arise for Myles to do\na bit of fighting, the others should stand by to see that he had fair\nplay.\n\n\"When thinkest thou that thou wilt take thy stand against them, Myles?\"\nasked Wilkes.\n\nMyles hesitated a moment. \"To-morrow,\" said he, grimly.\n\nSeveral of the lads whistled softly.\n\nGascoyne was prepared for an early opening of the war, but perhaps not\nfor such an early opening as this. \"By 'r Lady, Myles, thou art hungry\nfor brawling,\" said he.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nAfter the first excitement of meeting, discussing, and deciding had\npassed, Myles began to feel the weight of the load he had so boldly\ntaken upon himself. He began to reckon what a serious thing it was for\nhim to stand as a single champion against the tyranny that had grown\nso strong through years of custom. Had he let himself do so, he might\nalmost have repented, but it was too late now for repentance. He had\nlaid his hand to the plough, and he must drive the furrow.\n\nSomehow the news of impending battle had leaked out among the rest of\nthe body of squires, and a buzz of suppressed excitement hummed through\nthe dormitory that evening. The bachelors, to whom, no doubt, vague\nrumors had been blown, looked lowering, and talked together in low\nvoices, standing apart in a group. Some of them made a rather marked\nshow of secreting knives in the straw of their beds, and no doubt it had\nits effect upon more than one young heart that secretly thrilled at the\nsight of the shining blades. However, all was undisturbed that evening.\nThe lights were put out, and the lads retired with more than usual\nquietness, only for the murmur of whispering.\n\nAll night Myles's sleep was more or less disturbed by dreams in which he\nwas now conquering, now being conquered, and before the day had fairly\nbroken he was awake. He lay upon his cot, keying himself up for the\nencounter which he had set upon himself to face, and it would not be\nthe truth to say that the sight of those knives hidden in the straw\nthe night before had made no impression upon him. By-and-by he knew the\nothers were beginning to awake, for he heard them softly stirring, and\nas the light grew broad and strong, saw them arise, one by one, and\nbegin dressing in the gray morning. Then he himself arose and put on his\ndoublet and hose, strapping his belt tightly about his waist; then he\nsat down on the side of his cot.\n\nPresently that happened for which he was waiting; two of the younger\nsquires started to bring the bachelors' morning supply of water. As they\ncrossed the room Myles called to them in a loud voice--a little uneven,\nperhaps: \"Stop! We draw no more water for any one in this house, saving\nonly for ourselves. Set ye down those buckets, and go back to your\nplaces!\"\n\nThe two lads stopped, half turned, and then stood still, holding the\nthree buckets undecidedly.\n\nIn a moment all was uproar and confusion, for by this time every one\nof the lads had arisen, some sitting on the edge of their beds, some\nnearly, others quite dressed. A half-dozen of the Knights of the Rose\ncame over to where Myles stood, gathering in a body behind him and the\nothers followed, one after another.\n\nThe bachelors were hardly prepared for such prompt and vigorous action.\n\n\"What is to do?\" cried one of them, who stood near the two lads with the\nbuckets. \"Why fetch ye not the water?\"\n\n\"Falworth says we shall not fetch it,\" answered one of the lads, a boy\nby the name of Gosse.\n\n\"What mean ye by that, Falworth?\" the young man called to Myles.\n\nMyles's heart was beating thickly and heavily within him, but\nnevertheless he spoke up boldly enough. \"I mean,\" said he, \"that from\nhenceforth ye shall fetch and carry for yourselves.\"\n\n\"Look'ee, Blunt,\" called the bachelor; \"here is Falworth says they\nsquires will fetch no more water for us.\"\n\nThe head bachelor had heard all that had passed, and was even then\nhastily slipping on his doublet and hose. \"Now, then, Falworth,\" said he\nat last, striding forward, \"what is to do? Ye will fetch no more water,\neh? By 'r Lady, I will know the reason why.\"\n\nHe was still advancing towards Myles, with two or three of the older\nbachelors at his heels, when Gascoyne spoke.\n\n\"Thou hadst best stand back, Blunt,\" said he, \"else thou mayst be hurt.\nWe will not have ye bang Falworth again as ye once did, so stand thou\nback!\"\n\nBlunt stopped short and looked upon the lads standing behind Myles, some\nof them with faces a trifle pale perhaps, but all grim and determined\nlooking enough. Then he turned upon his heel suddenly, and walked back\nto the far end of the dormitory, where the bachelors were presently\nclustered together. A few words passed between them, and then the\nthirteen began at once arming themselves, some with wooden clogs,\nand some with the knives which they had so openly concealed the\nnight before. At the sign of imminent battle, all those not actively\ninterested scuttled away to right and left, climbing up on the benches\nand cots, and leaving a free field to the combatants. The next moment\nwould have brought bloodshed.\n\nNow Myles, thanks to the training of the Crosbey-Dale smith, felt\ntolerably sure that in a wrestling bout he was a match--perhaps more\nthan a match--for any one of the body of squires, and he had determined,\nif possible, to bring the battle to a single-handed encounter upon that\nfooting. Accordingly he suddenly stepped forward before the others.\n\n\"Look'ee, fellow,\" he called to Blunt, \"thou art he who struck me whilst\nI was down some while since. Wilt thou let this quarrel stand between\nthee and me, and meet me man to man without weapon? See, I throw me\ndown mine own, and will meet thee with bare hands.\" And as he spoke, he\ntossed the clog he held in his hand back upon the cot.\n\n\"So be it,\" said Blunt, with great readiness, tossing down a similar\nweapon which he himself held.\n\n\"Do not go, Myles,\" cried Gascoyne, \"he is a villain and a traitor, and\nwould betray thee to thy death. I saw him when he first gat from bed\nhide a knife in his doublet.\"\n\n\"Thou liest!\" said Blunt. \"I swear, by my faith, I be barehanded as ye\nsee me! Thy friend accuses me, Myles Falworth, because he knoweth thou\nart afraid of me.\"\n\n\"There thou liest most vilely!\" exclaimed Myles. \"Swear that thou hast\nno knife, and I will meet thee.\"\n\n\"Hast thou not heard me say that I have no knife?\" said Blunt. \"What\nmore wouldst thou have?\"\n\n\"Then I will meet thee halfway,\" said Myles.\n\nGascoyne caught him by the sleeve, and would have withheld him, assuring\nhim that he had seen the bachelor conceal a knife. But Myles, hot for\nthe fight, broke away from his friend without listening to him.\n\nAs the two advanced steadily towards one another a breathless silence\nfell upon the dormitory in sharp contrast to the uproar and confusion\nthat had filled it a moment before. The lads, standing some upon\nbenches, some upon beds, all watched with breathless interest the\nmeeting of the two champions.\n\nAs they approached one another they stopped and stood for a moment a\nlittle apart, glaring the one upon the other. They seemed ill enough\nmatched; Blunt was fully half a head taller than Myles, and was\nthick-set and close-knit in young manhood. Nothing but Myles's undaunted\npluck could have led him to dare to face an enemy so much older and\nstouter than himself.\n\nThe pause was only for a moment. They who looked saw Blunt slide his\nhand furtively towards his bosom. Myles saw too, and in the flash of an\ninstant knew what the gesture meant, and sprang upon the other before\nthe hand could grasp what it sought. As he clutched his enemy he felt\nwhat he had in that instant expected to feel--the handle of a dagger.\nThe next moment he cried, in a loud voice: \"Oh, thou villain! Help,\nGascoyne! He hath a knife under his doublet!\"\n\nIn answer to his cry for help, Myles's friends started to his aid. But\nthe bachelors shouted, \"Stand back and let them fight it out alone, else\nwe will knife ye too.\" And as they spoke, some of them leaped from the\nbenches whereon they stood, drawing their knives and flourishing them.\n\nFor just a few seconds Myles's friends stood cowed, and in those few\nseconds the fight came to an end with a suddenness unexpected to all.\n\nA struggle fierce and silent followed between the two; Blunt striving\nto draw his knife, and Myles, with the energy of despair, holding him\ntightly by the wrist. It was in vain the elder lad writhed and twisted;\nhe was strong enough to overbear Myles, but still was not able to clutch\nthe haft of his knife.\n\n\"Thou shalt not draw it!\" gasped Myles at last. \"Thou shalt not stab\nme!\"\n\nThen again some of his friends started forward to his aid, but they were\nnot needed, for before they came, the fight was over.\n\nBlunt, finding that he was not able to draw the weapon, suddenly ceased\nhis endeavors, and flung his arms around Myles, trying to bear him down\nupon the ground, and in that moment his battle was lost.\n\nIn an instant--so quick, so sudden, so unexpected that no one could see\nhow it happened--his feet were whirled away from under him, he spun with\nflying arms across Myles's loins, and pitched with a thud upon the stone\npavement, where he lay still, motionless, while Myles, his face white\nwith passion and his eyes gleaming, stood glaring around like a young\nwild-boar beset by the dogs.\n\nThe next moment the silence was broken, and the uproar broke forth\nwith redoubled violence. The bachelors, leaping from the benches, came\nhurrying forward on one side, and Myles's friends from the other.\n\n\"Thou shalt smart for this, Falworth,\" said one of the older lads.\n\"Belike thou hast slain him!\"\n\nMyles turned upon the speaker like a flash, and with such a passion of\nfury in his face that the other, a fellow nearly a head taller than he,\nshrank back, cowed in spite of himself. Then Gascoyne came and laid his\nhand on his friend's shoulder.\n\n\"Who touches me?\" cried Myles, hoarsely, turning sharply upon him; and\nthen, seeing who it was, \"Oh, Francis, they would ha' killed me!\"\n\n\"Come away, Myles,\" said Gascoyne; \"thou knowest not what thou doest;\nthou art mad; come away. What if thou hadst killed him?\"\n\nThe words called Myles somewhat to himself. \"I care not!\" said he, but\nsullenly and not passionately, and then he suffered Gascoyne and Wilkes\nto lead him away.\n\nMeantime Blunt's friends had turned him over, and, after feeling his\ntemples, his wrist, and his heart, bore him away to a bench at the far\nend of the room. There they fell to chafing his hands and sprinkling\nwater in his face, a crowd of the others gathering about. Blunt was\nhidden from Myles by those who stood around, and the lad listened to the\nbroken talk that filled the room with its confusion, his anxiety growing\nkeener as he became cooler. But at last, with a heartfelt joy, he\ngathered from the confused buzz of words that the other lad had opened\nhis eyes and, after a while, he saw him sit up, leaning his head upon\nthe shoulder of one of his fellow-bachelors, white and faint and sick as\ndeath.\n\n\"Thank Heaven that thou didst not kill him!\" said Edmund Wilkes, who\nhad been standing with the crowd looking on at the efforts of Blunt's\nfriends to revive him, and who had now come and sat down upon the bed\nnot far from Myles.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, gruffly, \"I do thank Heaven for that.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nIf Myles fancied that one single victory over his enemy would cure the\nevil against which he fought, he was grievously mistaken; wrongs are not\nrighted so easily as that. It was only the beginning. Other and far more\nbitter battles lay before him ere he could look around him and say, \"I\nhave won the victory.\"\n\nFor a day--for two days--the bachelors were demoralized at the fall of\ntheir leader, and the Knights of the Rose were proportionately uplifted.\n\nThe day that Blunt met his fall, the wooden tank in which the water\nhad been poured every morning was found to have been taken away. The\nbachelors made a great show of indignation and inquiry. Who was it stole\ntheir tank? If they did but know, he should smart for it.\n\n\"Ho! ho!\" roared Edmund Wilkes, so that the whole dormitory heard him,\n\"smoke ye not their tricks, lads? See ye not that they have stolen their\nown water-tank, so that they might have no need for another fight over\nthe carrying of the water?\"\n\nThe bachelors made an obvious show of not having heard what he said, and\na general laugh went around. No one doubted that Wilkes had spoken the\ntruth in his taunt, and that the bachelors had indeed stolen their own\ntank. So no more water was ever carried for the head squires, but it was\nplain to see that the war for the upperhand was not yet over.\n\nEven if Myles had entertained comforting thoughts to the contrary, he\nwas speedily undeceived. One morning, about a week after the fight, as\nhe and Gascoyne were crossing the armory court, they were hailed by\na group of the bachelors standing at the stone steps of the great\nbuilding.\n\n\"Holloa, Falworth!\" they cried. \"Knowest thou that Blunt is nigh well\nagain?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I knew it not. But I am right glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"Thou wilt sing a different song anon,\" said one of the bachelors. \"I\ntell thee he is hot against thee, and swears when he cometh again he\nwill carve thee soothly.\"\n\n\"Aye, marry!\" said another. \"I would not be in thy skin a week hence for\na ducat! Only this morning he told Philip Mowbray that he would have thy\nblood for the fall thou gavest him. Look to thyself, Falworth; he cometh\nagain Wednesday or Thursday next; thou standest in a parlous state.\"\n\n\"Myles,\" said Gascoyne, as they entered the great quadrangle, \"I do\nindeed fear me that he meaneth to do thee evil.\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said Myles, boldly; \"but I fear him not.\" Nevertheless his\nheart was heavy with the weight of impending ill.\n\nOne evening the bachelors were more than usually noisy in their end of\nthe dormitory, laughing and talking and shouting to one another.\n\n\"Holloa, you sirrah, Falworth!\" called one of them along the length of\nthe room. \"Blunt cometh again to-morrow day.\"\n\nMyles saw Gascoyne direct a sharp glance at him; but he answered nothing\neither to his enemy's words or his friend's look.\n\nAs the bachelor had said, Blunt came the next morning. It was just after\nchapel, and the whole body of squires was gathered in the armory waiting\nfor the orders of the day and the calling of the roll of those chosen\nfor household duty. Myles was sitting on a bench along the wall, talking\nand jesting with some who stood by, when of a sudden his heart gave a\ngreat leap within him.\n\nIt was Walter Blunt. He came walking in at the door as if nothing had\npassed, and at his unexpected coming the hubbub of talk and laughter\nwas suddenly checked. Even Myles stopped in his speech for a moment, and\nthen continued with a beating heart and a carelessness of manner that\nwas altogether assumed. In his hand Blunt carried the house orders for\nthe day, and without seeming to notice Myles, he opened it and read the\nlist of those called upon for household service.\n\nMyles had risen, and was now standing listening with the others. When\nBlunt had ended reading the list of names, he rolled up the parchment,\nand thrust it into his belt; then swinging suddenly on his heel, he\nstrode straight up to Myles, facing him front to front. A moment or two\nof deep silence followed; not a sound broke the stillness. When Blunt\nspoke every one in the armory heard his words.\n\n\"Sirrah!\" said he, \"thou didst put foul shame upon me some time sin.\nNever will I forget or forgive that offence, and will have a reckoning\nwith thee right soon that thou wilt not forget to the last day of thy\nlife.\"\n\nWhen Myles had seen his enemy turn upon him, he did not know at first\nwhat to expect; he would not have been surprised had they come to blows\nthere and then, and he held himself prepared for any event. He faced\nthe other pluckily enough and without flinching, and spoke up boldly in\nanswer. \"So be it, Walter Blunt; I fear thee not in whatever way thou\nmayst encounter me.\"\n\n\"Dost thou not?\" said Blunt. \"By'r Lady, thou'lt have cause to fear me\nere I am through with thee.\" He smiled a baleful, lingering smile, and\nthen turned slowly and walked away.\n\n\"What thinkest thou, Myles?\" said Gascoyne, as the two left the armory\ntogether.\n\n\"I think naught,\" said Myles gruffly. \"He will not dare to touch me\nto harm me. I fear him not.\" Nevertheless, he did not speak the full\nfeelings of his heart.\n\n\"I know not, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, shaking his head doubtfully. \"Walter\nBlunt is a parlous evil-minded knave, and methinks will do whatever evil\nhe promiseth.\"\n\n\"I fear him not,\" said Myles again; but his heart foreboded trouble.\n\nThe coming of the head squire made a very great change in the condition\nof affairs. Even before that coming the bachelors had somewhat recovered\nfrom their demoralization, and now again they began to pluck up their\nconfidence and to order the younger squires and pages upon this personal\nservice or upon that.\n\n\"See ye not,\" said Myles one day, when the Knights of the Rose were\ngathered in the Brutus Tower--\"see ye not that they grow as bad as ever?\nAn we put not a stop to this overmastery now, it will never stop.\"\n\n\"Best let it be, Myles,\" said Wilkes. \"They will kill thee an thou cease\nnot troubling them. Thou hast bred mischief enow for thyself already.\"\n\n\"No matter for that,\" said Myles; \"it is not to be borne that they order\nothers of us about as they do. I mean to speak to them to-night, and\ntell them it shall not be.\"\n\nHe was as good as his word. That night, as the youngsters were shouting\nand romping and skylarking, as they always did before turning in, he\nstood upon his cot and shouted: \"Silence! List to me a little!\" And\nthen, in the hush that followed--\"I want those bachelors to hear this:\nthat we squires serve them no longer, and if they would ha' some to wait\nupon them, they must get them otherwheres than here. There be twenty of\nus to stand against them and haply more, and we mean that they shall ha'\nservice of us no more.\"\n\nThen he jumped down again from his elevated stand, and an uproar of\nconfusion instantly filled the place. What was the effect of his words\nupon the bachelors he could not see. What was the result he was not slow\nin discovering.\n\nThe next day Myles and Gascoyne were throwing their daggers for a\nwager at a wooden target against the wall back of the armorer's smithy.\nWilkes, Gosse, and one or two others of the squires were sitting on\na bench looking on, and now and then applauding a more than usually\nwell-aimed cast of the knife. Suddenly that impish little page spoken of\nbefore, Robin Ingoldsby, thrust his shock head around the corner of\nthe smithy, and said: \"Ho, Falworth! Blunt is going to serve thee out\nto-day, and I myself heard him say so. He says he is going to slit thine\nears.\" And then he was gone as suddenly as he had appeared.\n\nMyles darted after him, caught him midway in the quadrangle, and brought\nhim back by the scuff of the neck, squalling and struggling.\n\n\"There!\" said he, still panting from the chase and seating the boy by no\nmeans gently upon the bench beside Wilkes. \"Sit thou there, thou imp of\nevil! And now tell me what thou didst mean by thy words anon--an thou\nstop not thine outcry, I will cut thy throat for thee,\" and he made a\nferocious gesture with his dagger.\n\nIt was by no means easy to worm the story from the mischievous little\nmonkey; he knew Myles too well to be in the least afraid of his threats.\nBut at last, by dint of bribing and coaxing, Myles and his friends\nmanaged to get at the facts. The youngster had been sent to clean the\nriding-boots of one of the bachelors, instead of which he had lolled\nidly on a cot in the dormitory, until he had at last fallen asleep. He\nhad been awakened by the opening of the dormitory door and by the sound\nof voices--among them was that of his taskmaster. Fearing punishment for\nhis neglected duty, he had slipped out of the cot, and hidden himself\nbeneath it.\n\nThose who had entered were Walter Blunt and three of the older\nbachelors. Blunt's companions were trying to persuade him against\nsomething, but without avail. It was--Myles's heart thrilled and his\nblood boiled--to lie in wait for him, to overpower him by numbers,\nand to mutilate him by slitting his ears--a disgraceful punishment\nadministered, as a rule, only for thieving and poaching.\n\n\"He would not dare to do such a thing!\" cried Myles, with heaving breast\nand flashing eyes.\n\n\"Aye, but he would,\" said Gascoyne. \"His father, Lord Reginald Blunt,\nis a great man over Nottingham way, and my Lord would not dare to punish\nhim even for such a matter as that. But tell me, Robin Ingoldsby, dost\nknow aught more of this matter? Prithee tell it me, Robin. Where do they\npropose to lie in wait for Falworth?\"\n\n\"In the gate-way of the Buttery Court, so as to catch him when he passes\nby to the armory,\" answered the boy.\n\n\"Are they there now?\" said Wilkes.\n\n\"Aye, nine of them,\" said Robin. \"I heard Blunt tell Mowbray to go and\ngather the others. He heard thee tell Gosse, Falworth, that thou wert\ngoing thither for thy arbalist this morn to shoot at the rooks withal.\"\n\n\"That will do, Robin,\" said Myles. \"Thou mayst go.\"\n\nAnd therewith the little imp scurried off, pulling the lobes of his ears\nsuggestively as he darted around the corner.\n\nThe others looked at one another for a while in silence.\n\n\"So, comrades,\" said Myles at last, \"what shall we do now?\"\n\n\"Go, and tell Sir James,\" said Gascoyne, promptly.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I take no such coward's part as that. I say an they\nhunger to fight, give them their stomachful.\"\n\nThe others were very reluctant for such extreme measures, but Myles, as\nusual, carried his way, and so a pitched battle was decided upon. It was\nGascoyne who suggested the plan which they afterwards followed.\n\nThen Wilkes started away to gather together those of the Knights of the\nRose not upon household duty, and Myles, with the others, went to the\narmor smith to have him make for them a set of knives with which to meet\ntheir enemies--knives with blades a foot long, pointed and double-edged.\n\nThe smith, leaning with his hammer upon the anvil, listened to them as\nthey described the weapons.\n\n\"Nay, nay, Master Myles,\" said he, when Myles had ended by telling the\nuse to which he intended putting them. \"Thou art going all wrong in this\nmatter. With such blades, ere this battle is ended, some one would be\nslain, and so murder done. Then the family of him who was killed would\nhaply have ye cited, and mayhap it might e'en come to the hanging, for\nsome of they boys ha' great folkeys behind them. Go ye to Tom Fletcher,\nMaster Myles, and buy of him good yew staves, such as one might break a\nhead withal, and with them, gin ye keep your wits, ye may hold your own\nagainst knives or short swords. I tell thee, e'en though my trade be\nmaking of blades, rather would I ha' a good stout cudgel in my hand than\nthe best dagger that ever was forged.\"\n\nMyles stood thoughtfully for a moment or two; then, looking up,\n\"Methinks thou speaketh truly, Robin,\" said he; \"and it were ill done to\nhave blood upon our hands.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nFrom the long, narrow stone-paved Armory Court, and connecting it with\nthe inner Buttery Court, ran a narrow arched passage-way, in which was\na picket-gate, closed at night and locked from within. It was in this\narched passage-way that, according to little Robert Ingoldsby's report,\nthe bachelors were lying in wait for Myles. Gascoyne's plan was that\nMyles should enter the court alone, the Knights of the Rose lying\nambushed behind the angle of the armory building until the bachelors\nshould show themselves.\n\nIt was not without trepidation that Myles walked alone into the court,\nwhich happened then to be silent and empty. His heart beat more quickly\nthan it was wont, and he gripped his cudgel behind his back, looking\nsharply this way and that, so as not to be taken unawares by a flank\nmovement of his enemies. Midway in the court he stopped and hesitated\nfor a moment; then he turned as though to enter the armory. The next\nmoment he saw the bachelors come pouring out from the archway.\n\nInstantly he turned and rushed back towards where his friends lay\nhidden, shouting: \"To the rescue! To the rescue!\"\n\n\"Stone him!\" roared Blunt. \"The villain escapes!\"\n\nHe stopped and picked up a cobble-stone as he spoke, flinging it after\nhis escaping prey. It narrowly missed Myles's head; had it struck him,\nthere might have been no more of this story to tell.\n\n\"To the rescue! To the rescue!\" shouted Myles's friends in answer, and\nthe next moment he was surrounded by them. Then he turned, and swinging\nhis cudgel, rushed back upon his foes.\n\nThe bachelors stopped short at the unexpected sight of the lads with\ntheir cudgels. For a moment they rallied and drew their knives; then\nthey turned and fled towards their former place of hiding.\n\nOne of them turned for a moment, and flung his knife at Myles with a\ndeadly aim; but Myles, quick as a cat, ducked his body, and the weapon\nflew clattering across the stony court. Then he who had flung it turned\nagain to fly, but in his attempt he had delayed one instant too long.\nMyles reached him with a long-arm stroke of his cudgel just as he\nentered the passage-way, knocking him over like a bottle, stunned and\nsenseless.\n\nThe next moment the picket-gate was banged in their faces and the bolt\nshot in the staples, and the Knights of the Rose were left shouting and\nbattering with their cudgels against the palings.\n\nBy this time the uproar of fight had aroused those in the rooms and\noffices fronting upon the Armory Court; heads were thrust from many of\nthe windows with the eager interest that a fight always evokes.\n\n\"Beware!\" shouted Myles. \"Here they come again!\" He bore back towards\nthe entrance of the alley-way as he spoke, those behind him scattering\nto right and left, for the bachelors had rallied, and were coming again\nto the attack, shouting.\n\nThey were not a moment too soon in this retreat, either, for the next\ninstant the pickets flew open, and a volley of stones flew after the\nretreating Knights of the Rose. One smote Wilkes upon the head,\nknocking him down headlong. Another struck Myles upon his left shoulder,\nbenumbing his arm from the finger-tips to the armpit, so that he thought\nat first the limb was broken.\n\n\"Get ye behind the buttresses!\" shouted those who looked down upon the\nfight from the windows--\"get ye behind the buttresses!\" And in answer\nthe lads, scattering like a newly-flushed covey of partridges, fled\nto and crouched in the sheltering angles of masonry to escape from the\nflying stones.\n\nAnd now followed a lull in the battle, the bachelors fearing to leave\nthe protection of the arched passage-way lest their retreat should be\ncut off, and the Knights of the Rose not daring to quit the shelter of\nthe buttresses and angles of the wall lest they should be knocked down\nby the stones.\n\nThe bachelor whom Myles had struck down with his cudgel was sitting up\nrubbing the back of his head, and Wilkes had gathered his wits enough to\ncrawl to the shelter of the nearest buttress. Myles, peeping around the\ncorner behind which he stood, could see that the bachelors were gathered\ninto a little group consulting together. Suddenly it broke asunder, and\nBlunt turned around.\n\n\"Ho, Falworth!\" he cried. \"Wilt thou hold truce whiles we parley with\nye?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered Myles.\n\n\"Wilt thou give me thine honor that ye will hold your hands from harming\nus whiles we talk together?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Myles, \"I will pledge thee mine honor.\"\n\n\"I accept thy pledge. See! here we throw aside our stones and lay\ndown our knives. Lay ye by your clubs, and meet us in parley at the\nhorse-block yonder.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Myles, and thereupon, standing his cudgel in the angle\nof the wall, he stepped boldly out into the open court-yard. Those of\nhis party came scatteringly from right and left, gathering about him;\nand the bachelors advanced in a body, led by the head squire.\n\n\"Now what is it thou wouldst have, Walter Blunt?\" said Myles, when both\nparties had met at the horse-block.\n\n\"It is to say this to thee, Myles Falworth,\" said the other. \"One time,\nnot long sin, thou didst challenge me to meet thee hand to hand in the\ndormitory. Then thou didst put a vile affront upon me, for the which I\nha' brought on this battle to-day, for I knew not then that thou wert\ngoing to try thy peasant tricks of wrestling, and so, without guarding\nmyself, I met thee as thou didst desire.\"\n\n\"But thou hadst thy knife, and would have stabbed him couldst thou ha'\ndone so,\" said Gascoyne.\n\n\"Thou liest!\" said Blunt. \"I had no knife.\" And then, without giving\ntime to answer, \"Thou canst not deny that I met thee then at thy\nbidding, canst thou, Falworth?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, \"nor haply canst thou deny it either.\" And at this\ncovert reminder of his defeat Myles's followers laughed scoffingly and\nBlunt bit his lip.\n\n\"Thou hast said it,\" said he. \"Then sin. I met thee at thy bidding,\nI dare to thee to meet me now at mine, and to fight this battle out\nbetween our two selves, with sword and buckler and bascinet as gentles\nshould, and not in a wrestling match like two country hodges.\"\n\n\"Thou art a coward caitiff, Walter Blunt!\" burst out Wilkes, who stood\nby with a swelling lump upon his head, already as big as a walnut. \"Well\nthou knowest that Falworth is no match for thee at broadsword play. Is\nhe not four years younger than thou, and hast thou not had three times\nthe practice in arms that he hath had? I say thou art a coward to seek\nto fight with cutting weapons.\"\n\nBlunt made no answer to Wilkes's speech, but gazed steadfastly at Myles,\nwith a scornful smile curling the corners of his lips. Myles stood\nlooking upon the ground without once lifting his eyes, not knowing what\nto answer, for he was well aware that he was no match for Blunt with the\nbroadsword.\n\n\"Thou art afraid to fight me, Myles Falworth,\" said Blunt, tauntingly,\nand the bachelors gave a jeering laugh in echo.\n\nThen Myles looked up, and I cannot say that his face was not a trifle\nwhiter than usual. \"Nay,\" said he, \"I am not afraid, and I will fight\nthee, Blunt.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Blunt. \"Then let us go at it straightway in the armory\nyonder, for they be at dinner in the Great Hall, and just now there\nbe'st no one by to stay us.\"\n\n\"Thou shalt not fight him, Myles!\" burst out Gascoyne. \"He will murther\nthee! Thou shalt not fight him, I say!\"\n\nMyles turned away without answering him.\n\n\"What is to do?\" called one of those who were still looking out of the\nwindows as the crowd of boys passed beneath.\n\n\"Blunt and Falworth are going to fight it out hand to hand in the\narmory,\" answered one of the bachelors, looking up.\n\nThe brawling of the squires was a jest to all the adjoining part of the\nhouse. So the heads were withdrawn again, some laughing at the \"sparring\nof the cockerels.\"\n\nBut it was no jesting matter to poor Myles.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nI have no intention to describe the fight between Myles Falworth and\nWalter Blunt. Fisticuffs of nowadays are brutal and debasing enough, but\na fight with a sharp-edged broadsword was not only brutal and debasing,\nbut cruel and bloody as well.\n\nFrom the very first of the fight Myles Falworth was palpably and\nobviously overmatched. After fifteen minutes had passed, Blunt stood\nhale and sound as at first; but poor Myles had more than one red stain\nof warm blood upon doublet and hose, and more than one bandage had been\nwrapped by Gascoyne and Wilkes about sore wounds.\n\nHe had received no serious injury as yet, for not only was his body\nprotected by a buckler, or small oblong shield, which he carried upon\nhis left arm, and his head by a bascinet, or light helmet of steel, but\nperhaps, after all, Blunt was not over-anxious to do him any dangerous\nharm. Nevertheless, there could be but one opinion as to how the fight\ntended, and Myles's friends were gloomy and downcast; the bachelors\nproportionately exultant, shouting with laughter, and taunting Myles at\nevery unsuccessful stroke.\n\nOnce, as he drew back panting, leaning upon Gascoyne's shoulder, the\nfaithful friend whispered, with trembling lips: \"Oh, dear Myles, carry\nit no further. Thou hurtest him not, and he will slay thee ere he have\ndone with thee.\"\n\nThereupon Blunt, who caught the drift of the speech, put in a word.\n\"Thou art sore hurt, Myles Falworth,\" said he, \"and I would do thee no\ngrievous harm. Yield thee and own thyself beaten, and I will forgive\nthee. Thou hast fought a good fight, and there is no shame in yielding\nnow.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried Myles, hoarsely--\"never will I yield me! Thou mayst slay\nme, Walter Blunt, and I reck not if thou dost do so, but never else wilt\nthou conquer me.\"\n\nThere was a tone of desperation in his voice that made all look serious.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Blunt; \"I will fight thee no more, Myles Falworth; thou hast\nhad enough.\"\n\n\"By heavens!\" cried Myles, grinding his teeth, \"thou shalt fight me,\nthou coward! Thou hast brought this fight upon us, and either thou or I\nget our quittance here. Let go, Gascoyne!\" he cried, shaking loose his\nfriend's hold; \"I tell thee he shall fight me!\"\n\nFrom that moment Blunt began to lose his head. No doubt he had not\nthought of such a serious fight as this when he had given his challenge,\nand there was a savage bull-dog tenacity about Myles that could not but\nhave had a somewhat demoralizing effect upon him.\n\nA few blows were given and taken, and then Myles's friends gave a shout.\nBlunt drew back, and placed his hand to his shoulder. When he drew\nit away again it was stained with red, and another red stain grew and\nspread rapidly down the sleeve of his jacket. He stared at his hand for\na moment with a half-dazed look, and then glanced quickly to right and\nleft.\n\n\"I will fight no more,\" said he, sullenly.\n\n\"Then yield thee!\" cried Myles, exultantly.\n\nThe triumphant shouts of the Knights of the Rose stung Blunt like a\nlash, and the battle began again. Perhaps some of the older lads were of\na mind to interfere at this point, certainly some looked very serious,\nbut before they interposed, the fight was ended.\n\nBlunt, grinding his teeth, struck one undercut at his opponent--the\nsame undercut that Myles had that time struck at Sir James Lee at the\nknight's bidding when he first practised at the Devlen pels. Myles\nmet the blow as Sir James had met the blow that he had given, and then\nstruck in return as Sir James had struck--full and true. The bascinet\nthat Blunt wore glanced the blow partly, but not entirely. Myles felt\nhis sword bite through the light steel cap, and Blunt dropped his own\nblade clattering upon the floor. It was all over in an instant, but in\nthat instant what he saw was stamped upon Myles's mind with an indelible\nimprint. He saw the young man stagger backward; he saw the eyes roll\nupward; and a red streak shoot out from under the cap and run down\nacross the cheek.\n\nBlunt reeled half around, and then fell prostrate upon his face; and\nMyles stood staring at him with the delirious turmoil of his battle\ndissolving rapidly into a dumb fear at that which he had done.\n\nOnce again he had won the victory--but what a victory! \"Is he dead?\" he\nwhispered to Gascoyne.\n\n\"I know not,\" said Gascoyne, with a very pale face. \"But come away,\nMyles.\" And he led his friend out of the room.\n\nSome little while later one of the bachelors came to the dormitory where\nMyles, his wounds smarting and aching and throbbing, lay stretched upon\nhis cot, and with a very serious face bade him to go presently to Sir\nJames, who had just come from dinner, and was then in his office.\n\nBy this time Myles knew that he had not slain his enemy, and his heart\nwas light in spite of the coming interview. There was no one in\nthe office but Sir James and himself, and Myles, without concealing\nanything, told, point by point, the whole trouble. Sir James sat looking\nsteadily at him for a while after he had ended.\n\n\"Never,\" said he, presently, \"did I know any one of ye squires, in all\nthe time that I have been here, get himself into so many broils as thou,\nMyles Falworth. Belike thou sought to take this lad's life.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, earnestly; \"God forbid!\"\n\n\"Ne'theless,\" said Sir James, \"thou fetched him a main shrewd blow; and\nit is by good hap, and no fault of thine, that he will live to do more\nmischief yet. This is thy second venture at him; the third time, haply,\nthou wilt end him for good.\" Then suddenly assuming his grimmest and\nsternest manner: \"Now, sirrah, do I put a stop to this, and no more\nshall ye fight with edged tools. Get thee to the dormitory, and abide\nthere a full week without coming forth. Michael shall bring thee bread\nand water twice a day for that time. That is all the food thou shalt\nhave, and we will see if that fare will not cool thy hot humors withal.\"\n\nMyles had expected a punishment so much more severe than that which was\nthus meted to him, that in the sudden relief he broke into a convulsive\nlaugh, and then, with a hasty sweep, wiped a brimming moisture from his\neyes.\n\nSir James looked keenly at him for a moment. \"Thou art white i' the\nface,\" said he. \"Art thou wounded very sorely?\"\n\n\"Nay\" said Myles, \"it is not much; but I be sick in my stomach.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Sir James; \"I know that feeling well. It is thus\nthat one always feeleth in coming out from a sore battle when one hath\nsuffered wounds and lost blood. An thou wouldst keep thyself hale, keep\nthyself from needless fighting. Now go thou to the dormitory, and, as I\nsaid, come thou not forth again for a week. Stay, sirrah!\" he added; \"I\nwill send Georgebarber to thee to look to thy sores. Green wounds are\nbest drawn and salved ere they grow cold.\"\n\nI wonder what Myles would have thought had he known that so soon as\nhe had left the office, Sir James had gone straight to the Earl and\nrecounted the whole matter to him, with a deal of dry gusto, and that\nthe Earl listened laughing.\n\n\"Aye,\" said he, when Sir James had done, \"the boy hath mettle, sure.\nNevertheless, we must transplant this fellow Blunt to the office of\ngentleman-in-waiting. He must be old enough now, and gin he stayeth in\nhis present place, either he will do the boy a harm, or the boy will do\nhim a harm.\"\n\nSo Blunt never came again to trouble the squires' quarters; and\nthereafter the youngsters rendered no more service to the elders.\n\nMyles's first great fight in life was won.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nThe summer passed away, and the bleak fall came. Myles had long since\naccepted his position as one set apart from the others of his kind, and\nhad resigned himself to the evident fact that he was never to serve\nin the household in waiting upon the Earl. I cannot say that it never\ntroubled him, but in time there came a compensation of which I shall\nhave presently to speak.\n\nAnd then he had so much the more time to himself. The other lads were\nsometimes occupied by their household duties when sports were afoot\nin which they would liked to have taken part. Myles was always free\nto enter into any matter of the kind after his daily exercise had been\nperformed at the pels, the butts, or the tilting-court.\n\nBut even though he was never called to do service in \"my Lord's house,\"\nhe was not long in gaining a sort of second-hand knowledge of all the\nfamily. My Lady, a thin, sallow, faded dame, not yet past middle age,\nbut looking ten years older. The Lady Anne, the daughter of the house;\na tall, thin, dark-eyed, dark-haired, handsome young dame of twenty or\ntwenty-one years of age, hawk-nosed like her father, and silent, proud,\nand haughty, Myles heard the squires say. Lady Alice, the Earl of\nMackworth's niece and ward, a great heiress in her own right, a\nstrikingly pretty black-eyed girl of fourteen or fifteen.\n\nThese composed the Earl's personal family; but besides them was Lord\nGeorge Beaumont, his Earl's brother, and him Myles soon came to know\nbetter than any of the chief people of the castle excepting Sir James\nLee.\n\nFor since Myles's great battle in the armory, Lord George had taken a\nlaughing sort of liking to the lad, encouraging him at times to talk of\nhis adventures, and of his hopes and aspirations.\n\nPerhaps the Earl's younger brother--who was himself somewhat a soldier\nof fortune, having fought in Spain, France, and Germany--felt a certain\nkinship in spirit with the adventurous youngster who had his unfriended\nway to make in the world. However that might have been, Lord George was\nvery kind and friendly to the lad, and the willing service that Myles\nrendered him reconciled him not a little to the Earl's obvious neglect.\n\nBesides these of the more immediate family of the Earl were a number\nof knights, ladies, and gentlemen, some of them cadets, some of them\nretainers, of the house of Beaumont, for the princely nobles of those\ndays lived in state little less royal than royalty itself.\n\nMost of the knights and gentlemen Myles soon came to know by sight,\nmeeting them in Lord George's apartments in the south wing of the great\nhouse, and some of them, following the lead of Lord George, singled him\nout for friendly notice, giving him a nod or a word in passing.\n\n\nEvery season has its pleasures for boys, and the constant change that\nthey bring is one of the greatest delights of boyhood's days.\n\nAll of us, as we grow older, have in our memory pictures of by-gone\ntimes that are somehow more than usually vivid, the colors of some not\nblurring by time as others do. One of which, in remembering, always\nfilled Myles's heart in after-years with an indefinable pleasure, was\nthe recollection of standing with others of his fellow squires in the\ncrisp brown autumn grass of the paddock, and shooting with the long-bow\nat wildfowl, which, when the east wind was straining, flew low overhead\nto pitch to the lake in the forbidden precincts of the deer park beyond\nthe brow of the hill. More than once a brace or two of these wildfowl,\nshot in their southward flight by the lads and cooked by fat,\ngood-natured Mother Joan, graced the rude mess-table of the squires in\nthe long hall, and even the toughest and fishiest drake, so the fruit\nof their skill, had a savor that, somehow or other, the daintiest fare\nlacked in after-years.\n\nThen fall passed and winter came, bleak, cold, and dreary--not winter as\nwe know it nowadays, with warm fires and bright lights to make the long\nnights sweet and cheerful with comfort, but winter with all its grimness\nand sternness. In the great cold stone-walled castles of those days the\nonly fire and almost the only light were those from the huge blazing\nlogs that roared and crackled in the great open stone fireplace, around\nwhich the folks gathered, sheltering their faces as best they could from\nthe scorching heat, and cloaking their shoulders from the biting cold,\nfor at the farther end of the room, where giant shadows swayed and\nbowed and danced huge and black against the high walls, the white frost\nglistened in the moonlight on the stone pavements, and the breath went\nup like smoke.\n\nIn those days were no books to read, but at the best only rude stories\nand jests, recited by some strolling mummer or minstrel to the listening\ncircle, gathered around the blaze and welcoming the coarse, gross jests,\nand coarser, grosser songs with roars of boisterous laughter.\n\nYet bleak and dreary as was the winter in those days, and cold and\nbiting as was the frost in the cheerless, windy halls and corridors of\nthe castle, it was not without its joys to the young lads; for then, as\nnow, boys could find pleasure even in slushy weather, when the sodden\nsnow is fit for nothing but to make snowballs of.\n\nThrice that bitter winter the moat was frozen over, and the lads, making\nthemselves skates of marrow-bones, which they bought from the hall cook\nat a groat a pair, went skimming over the smooth surface, red-checked\nand shouting, while the crows and the jackdaws looked down at them from\nthe top of the bleak gray walls.\n\nThen at Yule-tide, which was somewhat of a rude semblance to the Merry\nChristmas season of our day, a great feast was held in the hall, and all\nthe castle folk were fed in the presence of the Earl and the Countess.\nOxen and sheep were roasted whole; huge suet puddings, made of barley\nmeal sweetened with honey and stuffed with plums, were boiled in great\ncaldrons in the open courtyard; whole barrels of ale and malmsey were\nbroached, and all the folk, gentle and simple, were bidden to the feast.\nAfterwards the minstrels danced and played a rude play, and in the\nevening a miracle show was performed on a raised platform in the north\nhall.\n\nFor a week afterwards the castle was fed upon the remains of the good\nthings left from that great feast, until everyone grew to loathe fine\nvictuals, and longed for honest beef and mustard again.\n\nThen at last in that constant change the winter was gone, and even the\nlads who had enjoyed its passing were glad when the winds blew warm once\nmore, and the grass showed green in sunny places, and the leader of the\nwild-fowl blew his horn, as they who in the fall had flown to the south\nflew, arrow-like, northward again; when the buds swelled and the leaves\nburst forth once more, and crocuses and then daffodils gleamed in the\ngreen grass, like sparks and flames of gold.\n\nWith the spring came the out-door sports of the season; among others\nthat of ball--for boys were boys, and played at ball even in those\nfaraway days--a game called trap-ball. Even yet in some parts of England\nit is played just as it was in Myles Falworth's day, and enjoyed just as\nMyles and his friends enjoyed it.\n\nSo now that the sun was warm and the weather pleasant the game of\ntrap-ball was in full swing every afternoon, the play-ground being an\nopen space between the wall that surrounded the castle grounds and that\nof the privy garden--the pleasance in which the ladies of the Earl's\nfamily took the air every day, and upon which their apartments opened.\n\nNow one fine breezy afternoon, when the lads were shouting and playing\nat this, then their favorite game, Myles himself was at the trap\nbarehanded and barearmed. The wind was blowing from behind him, and,\naided perhaps by it, he had already struck three of four balls nearly\nthe whole length of the court--an unusual distance--and several of the\nlads had gone back almost as far as the wall of the privy garden to\ncatch any ball that might chance to fly as far as that. Then once more\nMyles struck, throwing all his strength into the blow. The ball shot up\ninto the air, and when it fell, it was to drop within the privy garden.\n\nThe shouts of the young players were instantly stilled, and Gascoyne,\nwho stood nearest Myles, thrust his hands into his belt, giving a long\nshrill whistle.\n\n\"This time thou hast struck us all out, Myles,\" said he. \"There be no\nmore play for us until we get another ball.\"\n\nThe outfielders came slowly trooping in until they had gathered in a\nlittle circle around Myles.\n\n\"I could not help it,\" said Myles, in answer to their grumbling. \"How\nknew I the ball would fly so far? But if I ha' lost the ball, I can get\nit again. I will climb the wall for it.\"\n\n\"Thou shalt do naught of the kind, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, hastily.\n\"Thou art as mad as a March hare to think of such a venture! Wouldst get\nthyself shot with a bolt betwixt the ribs, like poor Diccon Cook?\"\n\nOf all places about the castle the privy garden was perhaps the most\nsacred. It was a small plot of ground, only a few rods long and wide,\nand was kept absolutely private for the use of the Countess and her\nfamily. Only a little while before Myles had first come to Devlen,\none of the cook's men had been found climbing the wall, whereupon the\nsoldier who saw him shot him with his cross bow. The poor fellow dropped\nfrom the wall into the garden, and when they found him, he still held\na bunch of flowers in his hand, which he had perhaps been gathering for\nhis sweetheart.\n\nHad Myles seen him carried on a litter to the infirmary as Gascoyne\nand some of the others had done, he might have thought twice before\nventuring to enter the ladies' private garden. As it was, he only shook\nhis stubborn head, and said again, \"I will climb the wall and fetch it.\"\n\nNow at the lower extremity of the court, and about twelve or fifteen\nfeet distant from the garden wall, there grew a pear-tree, some of the\nbranches of which overhung into the garden beyond. So, first making sure\nthat no one was looking that way, and bidding the others keep a sharp\nlookout, Myles shinned up this tree, and choosing one of the thicker\nlimbs, climbed out upon it for some little distance. Then lowering his\nbody, he hung at arm's-length, the branch bending with his weight, and\nslowly let himself down hand under hand, until at last he hung directly\nover the top of the wall, and perhaps a foot above it. Below him he\ncould see the leafy top of an arbor covered with a thick growth of\nclematis, and even as he hung there he noticed the broad smooth\nwalks, the grassy terrace in front of the Countess's apartments in the\ndistance, the quaint flower-beds, the yew-trees trimmed into odd shapes,\nand even the deaf old gardener working bare-armed in the sunlight at a\nflower-bed in the far corner by the tool-house.\n\nThe top of the wall was pointed like a house roof, and immediately below\nhim was covered by a thick growth of green moss, and it flashed through\nhis mind as he hung there that maybe it would offer a very slippery\nfoothold for one dropping upon the steep slopes of the top. But it was\ntoo late to draw back now.\n\nBracing himself for a moment, he loosed his hold upon the limb above.\nThe branch flew back with a rush, and he dropped, striving to grasp the\nsloping angle with his feet. Instantly the treacherous slippery moss\nslid away from beneath him; he made a vain clutch at the wall, his\nfingers sliding over the cold stones, then, with a sharp exclamation,\ndown he pitched bodily into the garden beneath! A thousand thoughts\nflew through his brain like a cloud of flies, and then a leafy greenness\nseemed to strike up against him. A splintering crash sounded in his\nears as the lattice top of the arbor broke under him, and with one final\nclutch at the empty air he fell heavily upon the ground beneath.\n\nHe heard a shrill scream that seemed to find an instant echo; even as\nhe fell he had a vision of faces and bright colors, and when he sat up,\ndazed and bewildered, he found himself face to face with the Lady Anne,\nthe daughter of the house, and her cousin, the Lady Alice, who clutching\none another tightly, stood staring at him with wide scared eyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nFor a little time there was a pause of deep silence, during which the\nfluttering leaves came drifting down from the broken arbor above.\n\nIt was the Lady Anne who first spoke. \"Who art thou, and whence comest\nthou?\" said she, tremulously.\n\nThen Myles gathered himself up sheepishly. \"My name is Myles Falworth,\"\nsaid he, \"and I am one of the squires of the body.\"\n\n\"Oh! aye!\" said the Lady Alice, suddenly. \"Me thought I knew thy face.\nArt thou not the young man that I have seen in Lord George's train?\"\n\n\"Yes, lady,\" said Myles, wrapping and twining a piece of the broken vine\nin and out among his fingers. \"Lord George hath often had me of late\nabout his person.\"\n\n\"And what dost thou do here, sirrah?\" said Lady Anne, angrily. \"How\ndarest thou come so into our garden?\"\n\n\"I meant not to come as I did,\" said Myles, clumsily, and with a face\nhot and red. \"But I slipped over the top of the wall and fell hastily\ninto the garden. Truly, lady, I meant ye no harm or fright thereby.\"\n\nHe looked so drolly abashed as he stood before them, with his clothes\ntorn and soiled from the fall, his face red, and his eyes downcast, all\nthe while industriously twisting the piece of clematis in and around his\nfingers, that Lady Anne's half-frightened anger could not last. She and\nher cousin exchanged glances, and smiled at one another.\n\n\"But,\" said she at last, trying to draw her pretty brows together into a\nfrown, \"tell me; why didst thou seek to climb the wall?\"\n\n\"I came to seek a ball,\" said Myles, \"which I struck over hither from\nthe court beyond.\"\n\n\"And wouldst thou come into our privy garden for no better reason than\nto find a ball?\" said the young lady.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles; \"it was not so much to find the ball, but, in good\nsooth, I did truly strike it harder than need be, and so, gin I lost the\nball, I could do no less than come and find it again, else our sport is\ndone for the day. So it was I came hither.\"\n\nThe two young ladies had by now recovered from their fright. The Lady\nAnne slyly nudged her cousin with her elbow, and the younger could not\nsuppress a half-nervous laugh. Myles heard it, and felt his face grow\nhotter and redder than ever.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Lady Anne, \"I do believe Master Giles--\"\n\n\"My name be'st Myles,\" corrected Myles.\n\n\"Very well, then, Master Myles, I say I do believe that thou meanest\nno harm in coming hither; ne'theless it was ill of thee so to do. An my\nfather should find thee here, he would have thee shrewdly punished for\nsuch trespassing. Dost thou not know that no one is permitted to enter\nthis place--no, not even my uncle George? One fellow who came hither to\nsteal apples once had his ears shaven close to his head, and not more\nthan a year ago one of the cook's men who climbed the wall early one\nmorning was shot by the watchman.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, \"I knew of him who was shot, and it did go somewhat\nagainst my stomach to venture, knowing what had happed to him.\nNe'theless, an I gat not the ball, how were we to play more to-day at\nthe trap?\"\n\n\"Marry, thou art a bold fellow, I do believe me,\" said the young lady,\n\"and sin thou hast come in the face of such peril to get thy ball, thou\nshalt not go away empty. Whither didst thou strike it?\"\n\n\"Over yonder by the cherry-tree,\" said Myles, jerking his head in that\ndirection. \"An I may go get it, I will trouble ye no more.\" As he spoke\nhe made a motion to leave them.\n\n\"Stay!\" said the Lady Anne, hastily; \"remain where thou art. An thou\ncross the open, some one may haply see thee from the house, and will\ngive the alarm, and thou wilt be lost. I will go get thy ball.\"\n\nAnd so she left Myles and her cousin, crossing the little plots of grass\nand skirting the rosebushes to the cherry-tree.\n\nWhen Myles found himself alone with Lady Alice, he knew not where to\nlook or what to do, but twisted the piece of clematis which he still\nheld in and out more industriously than ever.\n\nLady Alice watched him with dancing eyes for a little while. \"Haply thou\nwilt spoil that poor vine,\" said she by-and-by, breaking the silence and\nlaughing, then turning suddenly serious again. \"Didst thou hurt thyself\nby thy fall?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, looking up, \"such a fall as that was no great matter.\nMany and many a time I have had worse.\"\n\n\"Hast thou so?\" said the Lady Alice. \"Thou didst fright me parlously,\nand my coz likewise.\"\n\nMyles hesitated for a moment, and then blurted out, \"Thereat I grieve,\nfor thee I would not fright for all the world.\"\n\nThe young lady laughed and blushed. \"All the world is a great matter,\"\nsaid she.\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"it is a great matter; but it is a greater matter to\nfright thee, and so I would not do it for that, and more.\"\n\nThe young lady laughed again, but she did not say anything further, and\na space of silence fell so long that by-and-by she forced herself to\nsay, \"My cousin findeth not the ball presently.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, briefly, and then again neither spoke, until\nby-and-by the Lady Anne came, bringing the ball. Myles felt a great\nsense of relief at that coming, and yet was somehow sorry. Then he took\nthe ball, and knew enough to bow his acknowledgment in a manner neither\nill nor awkward.\n\n\"Didst thou hurt thyself?\" asked Lady Anne.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, giving himself a shake; \"seest thou not I be whole,\nlimb and bone? Nay, I have had shrewdly worse falls than that. Once I\nfell out of an oak-tree down by the river and upon a root, and bethought\nme I did break a rib or more. And then one time when I was a boy in\nCrosbey-Dale--that was where I lived before I came hither--I did catch\nme hold of the blade of the windmill, thinking it was moving slowly, and\nthat I would have a ride i' th' air, and so was like to have had a fall\nten thousand times worse than this.\"\n\n\"Oh, tell us more of that!\" said the Lady Anne, eagerly. \"I did never\nhear of such an adventure as that. Come, coz, and sit down here upon the\nbench, and let us have him tell us all of that happening.\"\n\nNow the lads upon the other side of the wall had been whistling\nfurtively for some time, not knowing whether Myles had broken his neck\nor had come off scot-free from his fall. \"I would like right well to\nstay with ye,\" said he, irresolutely, \"and would gladly tell ye that and\nmore an ye would have me to do so; but hear ye not my friends call me\nfrom beyond? Mayhap they think I break my back, and are calling to see\nwhether I be alive or no. An I might whistle them answer and toss me\nthis ball to them, all would then be well, and they would know that I\nwas not hurt, and so, haply, would go away.\"\n\n\"Then answer them,\" said the Lady Anne, \"and tell us of that thing thou\nspokest of anon--how thou tookest a ride upon the windmill. We young\nladies do hear little of such matters, not being allowed to talk with\nlads. All that we hear of perils are of knights and ladies and jousting,\nand such like. It would pleasure us right well to have thee tell of thy\nadventures.\"\n\nSo Myles tossed back the ball, and whistled in answer to his friends.\n\nThen he told the two young ladies not only of his adventure upon the\nwindmill, but also of other boyish escapades, and told them well, with\na straightforward smack and vigor, for he enjoyed adventure and loved to\ntalk of it. In a little while he had regained his ease; his shyness and\nawkwardness left him, and nothing remained but the delightful fact that\nhe was really and actually talking to two young ladies, and that with\njust as much ease and infinitely more pleasure than could be had in\ndiscourse with his fellow-squires. But at last it was time for him to\ngo. \"Marry,\" said he, with a half-sigh, \"methinks I did never ha' so\nsweet and pleasant a time in all my life before. Never did I know a\nreal lady to talk with, saving only my mother, and I do tell ye\nplain methinks I would rather talk with ye than with any he in\nChristendom--saving, perhaps, only my friend Gascoyne. I would I might\ncome hither again.\"\n\nThe honest frankness of his speech was irresistible; the two girls\nexchanged glances and then began laughing. \"Truly,\" said Lady Anne, who,\nas was said before, was some three or four years older than Myles,\n\"thou art a bold lad to ask such a thing. How wouldst thou come hither?\nWouldst tumble through our clematis arbor again, as thou didst this\nday?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I would not do that again, but if ye will bid me do\nso, I will find the means to come hither.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Lady Anne, \"I dare not bid thee do such a foolhardy thing.\nNevertheless, if thou hast the courage to come--\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Myles, eagerly, \"I have the courage.\"\n\n\"Then, if thou hast so, we will be here in the garden on Saturday next\nat this hour. I would like right well to hear more of thy adventures.\nBut what didst thou say was thy name? I have forgot it again.\"\n\n\"It is Myles Falworth.\"\n\n\"Then we shall yclep thee Sir Myles, for thou art a soothly\nerrant-knight. And stay! Every knight must have a lady to serve. How\nwouldst thou like my Cousin Alice here for thy true lady?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, eagerly, \"I would like it right well.\" And then he\nblushed fiery red at his boldness.\n\n\"I want no errant-knight to serve me,\" said the Lady Alice, blushing,\nin answer. \"Thou dost ill tease me, coz! An thou art so free in choosing\nhim a lady to serve, thou mayst choose him thyself for thy pains.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Lady Anne, laughing; \"I say thou shalt be his true lady,\nand he shall be thy true knight. Who knows? Perchance he may serven thee\nin some wondrous adventure, like as Chaucer telleth of. But now, Sir\nErrant-Knight, thou must take thy leave of us, and I must e'en let thee\nprivily out by the postern-wicket. And if thou wilt take the risk upon\nthee and come hither again, prithee be wary in that coming, lest in\nventuring thou have thine ears clipped in most unknightly fashion.\"\n\nThat evening, as he and Gascoyne sat together on a bench under the trees\nin the great quadrangle, Myles told of his adventure of the afternoon,\nand his friend listened with breathless interest.\n\n\"But, Myles,\" cried Gascoyne, \"did the Lady Anne never once seem proud\nand unkind?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles; \"only at first, when she chid me for falling through\nthe roof of their arbor. And to think, Francis! Lady Anne herself\nbade me hold the Lady Alice as my true lady, and to serve her in all\nknightliness!\" Then he told his friend that he was going to the privy\ngarden again on the next Saturday, and that the Lady Anne had given him\npermission so to do.\n\nGascoyne gave a long, wondering whistle, and then sat quite still,\nstaring into the sky. By-and-by he turned to his friend and said, \"I\ngive thee my pledge, Myles Falworth, that never in all my life did I\nhear of any one that had such marvellous strange happenings befall him\nas thou.\"\n\n\nWhenever the opportunity occurred for sending a letter to Crosbey-Holt,\nMyles wrote one to his mother; and one can guess how they were treasured\nby the good lady, and read over and over again to the blind old Lord as\nhe sat staring into darkness with his sightless eyes.\n\nAbout the time of this escapade he wrote a letter telling of those\ndoings, wherein, after speaking of his misadventure of falling from the\nwall, and of his acquaintance with the young ladies, he went on to speak\nof the matter in which he repeated his visits. The letter was worded\nin the English of that day--the quaint and crabbed language in which\nChaucer wrote. Perhaps few boys could read it nowadays, so, modernizing\nit somewhat, it ran thus:\n\n\"And now to let ye weet that thing that followed that happening that\nmade me acquaint with they two young Damoiselles. I take me to the south\nwall of that garden one day four and twenty great spikes, which Peter\nSmith did forge for me and for which I pay him fivepence, and that all\nthe money that I had left of my half-year's wage, and wot not where I\nmay get more at these present, withouten I do betake me to Sir James,\nwho, as I did tell ye, hath consented to hold those moneys that Prior\nEdward gave me till I need them.\n\n\"Now these same spikes, I say, I take me them down behind the corner of\nthe wall, and there drave them betwixt the stones, my very dear comrade\nand true friend Gascoyne holping me thereto to do. And so come Saturday,\nI climb me over the wall and to the roof of the tool-house below,\nseeking a fitting opportunity when I might so do without being in too\ngreat jeopardy.\n\n\"Yea; and who should be there but they two ladies, biding my coming,\nwho, seeing me, made as though they had expected me not, and gave me\ngreatest rebuke for adventuring so moughtily. Yet, methinks, were they\nright well pleasured that I should so aventure, which indeed I might not\notherwise do, seeing as I have telled to thee, that one of them is mine\nown true lady for to serven, and so was the only way that I might come\nto speech with her.\"\n\nSuch was Myles's own quaint way of telling how he accomplished his aim\nof visiting the forbidden garden, and no doubt the smack of adventure\nand the savor of danger in the undertaking recommended him not a little\nto the favor of the young ladies.\n\nAfter this first acquaintance perhaps a month passed, during which Myles\nhad climbed the wall some half a dozen times (for the Lady Anne\nwould not permit of too frequent visits), and during which the first\nacquaintance of the three ripened rapidly to an honest, pleasant\nfriendship. More than once Myles, when in Lord George's train, caught\na covert smile or half nod from one or both of the girls, not a little\ndelightful in its very secret friendliness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nAs was said, perhaps a month passed; then Myles's visits came to an\nabrupt termination, and with it ended, in a certain sense, a chapter of\nhis life.\n\nOne Saturday afternoon he climbed the garden wall, and skirting behind\na long row of rosebushes that screened him from the Countess's terrace,\ncame to a little summer-house where the two young ladies had appointed\nto meet him that day.\n\nA pleasant half-hour or so was passed, and then it was time for Myles\nto go. He lingered for a while before he took his final leave, leaning\nagainst the door-post, and laughingly telling how he and some of his\nbrother squires had made a figure of straw dressed in men's clothes, and\nhad played a trick with it one night upon a watchman against whom they\nbore a grudge.\n\nThe young ladies were listening with laughing faces, when suddenly, as\nMyles looked, he saw the smile vanish from Lady Alice's eyes and a wide\nterror take its place. She gave a half-articulate cry, and rose abruptly\nfrom the bench upon which she was sitting.\n\nMyles turned sharply, and then his very heart seemed to stand still\nwithin him; for there, standing in the broad sunlight without, and\nglaring in upon the party with baleful eyes, was the Earl of Mackworth\nhimself.\n\nHow long was the breathless silence that followed, Myles could never\ntell. He knew that the Lady Anne had also risen, and that she and her\ncousin were standing as still as statues. Presently the Earl pointed to\nthe house with his staff, and Myles noted stupidly how it trembled in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Ye wenches,\" said he at last, in a hard, harsh voice--\"ye wenches, what\nmeaneth this? Would ye deceive me so, and hold parlance thus secretly\nwith this fellow? I will settle with him anon. Meantime get ye\nstraightway to the house and to your rooms, and there abide until I give\nye leave to come forth again. Go, I say!\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Lady Anne, in a breathless voice--she was as white as\ndeath, and moistened her lips with her tongue before she spoke--\"father,\nthou wilt not do harm to this young man. Spare him, I do beseech thee,\nfor truly it was I who bade him come hither. I know that he would not\nhave come but at our bidding.\"\n\nThe Earl stamped his foot upon the gravel. \"Did ye not hear me?\" said\nhe, still pointing towards the house with his trembling staff. \"I bade\nye go to your rooms. I will settle with this fellow, I say, as I deem\nfitting.\"\n\n\"Father,\" began Lady Anne again; but the Earl made such a savage gesture\nthat poor Lady Alice uttered a faint shriek, and Lady Anne stopped\nabruptly, trembling. Then she turned and passed out the farther door of\nthe summerhouse, poor little Lady Alice following, holding her tight\nby the skirts, and trembling and shuddering as though with a fit of the\nague.\n\nThe Earl stood looking grimly after them from under his shaggy eyebrows,\nuntil they passed away behind the yew-trees, appeared again upon the\nterrace behind, entered the open doors of the women's house, and were\ngone. Myles heard their footsteps growing fainter and fainter, but he\nnever raised his eyes. Upon the ground at his feet were four pebbles,\nand he noticed how they almost made a square, and would do so if he\npushed one of them with his toe, and then it seemed strange to him that\nhe should think of such a little foolish thing at that dreadful time.\n\nHe knew that the Earl was looking gloomily at him, and that his face\nmust be very pale. Suddenly Lord Mackworth spoke. \"What hast thou to\nsay?\" said he, harshly.\n\nThen Myles raised his eyes, and the Earl smiled grimly as he looked his\nvictim over. \"I have naught to say,\" said the lad, huskily.\n\n\"Didst thou not hear what my daughter spake but now?\" said the Earl.\n\"She said that thou came not of thy own free-will; what sayst thou to\nthat, sirrah--is it true?\"\n\nMyles hesitated for a moment or two; his throat was tight and dry.\n\"Nay,\" said he at last, \"she belieth herself. It was I who first came\ninto the garden. I fell by chance from the tree yonder--I was seeking\na ball--then I asked those two if I might not come hither again, and so\nhave done some several times in all. But as for her--nay; it was not at\nher bidding that I came, but through mine own asking.\"\n\nThe Earl gave a little grunt in his throat. \"And how often hast thou\nbeen here?\" said he, presently.\n\nMyles thought a moment or two. \"This maketh the seventh time,\" said he.\n\nAnother pause of silence followed, and Myles began to pluck up some\nheart that maybe all would yet be well. The Earl's next speech dashed\nthat hope into a thousand fragments. \"Well thou knowest,\" said he, \"that\nit is forbid for any to come here. Well thou knowest that twice have men\nbeen punished for this thing that thou hast done, and yet thou camest in\nspite of all. Now dost thou know what thou wilt suffer?\"\n\nMyles picked with nervous fingers at a crack in the oaken post against\nwhich he leaned. \"Mayhap thou wilt kill me,\" said he at last, in a dull,\nchoking voice.\n\nAgain the Earl smiled a grim smile. \"Nay,\" said he, \"I would not slay\nthee, for thou hast gentle blood. But what sayest thou should I shear\nthine ears from thine head, or perchance have thee scourged in the great\ncourt?\"\n\nThe sting of the words sent the blood flying back to Myles's face again,\nand he looked quickly up. \"Nay,\" said he, with a boldness that surprised\nhimself; \"thou shalt do no such unlordly thing upon me as that. I be thy\npeer, sir, in blood; and though thou mayst kill me, thou hast no right\nto shame me.\"\n\nLord Mackworth bowed with a mocking courtesy. \"Marry!\" said he.\n\"Methought it was one of mine own saucy popinjay squires that I caught\nsneaking here and talking to those two foolish young lasses, and lo! it\nis a young Lord--or mayhap thou art a young Prince--and commandeth\nme that I shall not do this and I shall not do that. I crave your\nLordship's honorable pardon, if I have said aught that may have galled\nyou.\"\n\nThe fear Myles had felt was now beginning to dissolve in rising wrath.\n\"Nay,\" said he, stoutly, \"I be no Lord and I be no Prince, but I be as\ngood as thou. For am I not the son of thy onetime very true comrade and\nthy kinsman--to wit, the Lord Falworth, whom, as thou knowest, is poor\nand broken, and blind, and helpless, and outlawed, and banned? Yet,\"\ncried he, grinding his teeth, as the thought of it all rushed in upon\nhim, \"I would rather be in his place than in yours; for though he be\nruined, you--\"\n\nHe had just sense enough to stop there.\n\nThe Earl, gripping his staff behind his back, and with his head a little\nbent, was looking keenly at the lad from under his shaggy gray brows.\n\"Well,\" said he, as Myles stopped, \"thou hast gone too far now to draw\nback. Say thy say to the end. Why wouldst thou rather be in thy father's\nstead than in mine?\"\n\nMyles did not answer.\n\n\"Thou shalt finish thy speech, or else show thyself a coward. Though thy\nfather is ruined, thou didst say I am--what?\"\n\nMyles keyed himself up to the effort, and then blurted out, \"Thou art\nattainted with shame.\"\n\nA long breathless silence followed.\n\n\"Myles Falworth,\" said the Earl at last (and even in the whirling of his\nwits Myles wondered that he had the name so pat)--\"Myles Falworth, of\nall the bold, mad, hare-brained fools, thou art the most foolish. How\ndost thou dare say such words to me? Dost thou not know that thou makest\nthy coming punishment ten times more bitter by such a speech?\"\n\n\"Aye!\" cried Myles, desperately; \"but what else could I do? An I did not\nsay the words, thou callest me coward, and coward I am not.\"\n\n\"By 'r Lady!\" said the Earl, \"I do believe thee. Thou art a bold,\nimpudent varlet as ever lived--to beard me so, forsooth! Hark'ee; thou\nsayst I think naught of mine old comrade. I will show thee that thou\ndost belie me. I will suffer what thou hast said to me for his sake, and\nfor his sake will forgive thee thy coming hither--which I would not do\nin another case to any other man. Now get thee gone straightway, and\ncome hither no more. Yonder is the postern-gate; mayhap thou knowest the\nway. But stay! How camest thou hither?\"\n\nMyles told him of the spikes he had driven in the wall, and the Earl\nlistened, stroking his beard. When the lad had ended, he fixed a sharp\nlook upon him. \"But thou drove not those spikes alone,\" said he; \"who\nhelped thee do it?\"\n\n\"That I may not tell,\" said Myles, firmly.\n\n\"So be it,\" said the Earl. \"I will not ask thee to tell his name. Now\nget thee gone! And as for those spikes, thou mayst e'en knock them out\nof the wall, sin thou drave them in. Play no more pranks an thou wouldst\nkeep thy skin whole. And now go, I say!\"\n\nMyles needed no further bidding, but turned and left the Earl without\nanother word. As he went out the postern-gate he looked over his\nshoulder, and saw the tall figure, in its long fur-trimmed gown, still\nstanding in the middle of the path, looking after him from under the\nshaggy eyebrows.\n\nAs he ran across the quadrangle, his heart still fluttering in his\nbreast, he muttered to himself, \"The old grizzle-beard; an I had not\nfaced him a bold front, mayhap he would have put such shame upon me\nas he said. I wonder why he stood so staring after me as I left the\ngarden.\"\n\nThen for the time the matter slipped from his mind, saving only that\npart that smacked of adventure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nSo for a little while Myles was disposed to congratulate himself upon\nhaving come off so well from his adventure with the Earl. But after a\nday or two had passed, and he had time for second thought, he began to\nmisdoubt whether, after all, he might not have carried it with a better\nair if he had shown more chivalrous boldness in the presence of his true\nlady; whether it would not have redounded more to his credit if he had\nin some way asserted his rights as the young dame's knight-errant and\ndefender. Was it not ignominious to resign his rights and privileges so\neasily and tamely at a signal from the Earl?\n\n\"For, in sooth,\" said he to Gascoyne, as the two talked the matter over,\n\"she hath, in a certain way, accepted me for her knight, and yet I stood\nme there without saying so much as one single word in her behalf.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Gascoyne, \"I would not trouble me on that score. Methinks\nthat thou didst come off wondrous well out of the business. I would not\nhave thought it possible that my Lord could ha' been so patient with\nthee as he showed himself. Methinks, forsooth, he must hold thee privily\nin right high esteem.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said Myles, after a little pause of meditative silence, \"I know\nnot of any esteem, yet I do think he was passing patient with me in this\nmatter. But ne'theless, Francis, that changeth not my stand in the case.\nYea, I did shamefully, so to resign my lady without speaking one word;\nnor will I so resign her even yet. I have bethought me much of this\nmatter of late, Francis, and now I come to thee to help me from my evil\ncase. I would have thee act the part of a true friend to me--like that\none I have told thee of in the story of the Emperor Justinian. I would\nhave thee, when next thou servest in the house, to so contrive that my\nLady Alice shall get a letter which I shall presently write, and wherein\nI may set all that is crooked straight again.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid,\" said Gascoyne, hastily, \"that I should be such a fool\nas to burn my fingers in drawing thy nuts from the fire! Deliver thy\nletter thyself, good fellow!\"\n\nSo spoke Gascoyne, yet after all he ended, as he usually did, by\nyielding to Myles's superior will and persistence. So the letter was\nwritten and one day the good-natured Gascoyne carried it with him to the\nhouse, and the opportunity offering, gave it to one of the young ladies\nattendant upon the Countess's family--a lass with whom he had friendly\nintimacy--to be delivered to Lady Alice.\n\nBut if Myles congratulated himself upon the success of this new\nadventure, it was not for long. That night, as the crowd of pages and\nsquires were making themselves ready for bed, the call came through the\nuproar for \"Myles Falworth! Myles Falworth!\"\n\n\"Here I be,\" cried Myles, standing up on his cot. \"Who calleth me?\"\n\nIt was the groom of the Earl's bedchamber, and seeing Myles standing\nthus raised above the others, he came walking down the length of the\nroom towards him, the wonted hubbub gradually silencing as he advanced\nand the youngsters turning, staring, and wondering.\n\n\"My Lord would speak with thee, Myles Falworth,\" said the groom, when he\nhad come close enough to where Myles stood. \"Busk thee and make ready;\nhe is at livery even now.\"\n\nThe groom's words fell upon Myles like a blow. He stood for a while\nstaring wide-eyed. \"My Lord speak with me, sayst thou!\" he ejaculated at\nlast.\n\n\"Aye,\" said the other, impatiently; \"get thee ready quickly. I must\nreturn anon.\"\n\nMyles's head was in a whirl as he hastily changed his clothes for a\nbetter suit, Gascoyne helping him. What could the Earl want with him at\nthis hour? He knew in his heart what it was; the interview could concern\nnothing but the letter that he had sent to Lady Alice that day. As he\nfollowed the groom through the now dark and silent courts, and across\nthe corner of the great quadrangle, and so to the Earl's house, he tried\nto brace his failing courage to meet the coming interview. Nevertheless,\nhis heart beat tumultuously as he followed the other down the long\ncorridor, lit only by a flaring link set in a wrought-iron bracket. Then\nhis conductor lifted the arras at the door of the bedchamber, whence\ncame the murmuring sound of many voices, and holding it aside, beckoned\nhim to enter, and Myles passed within. At the first, he was conscious\nof nothing but a crowd of people, and of the brightness of many lighted\ncandles; then he saw that he stood in a great airy room spread with a\nwoven mat of rushes. On three sides the walls were hung with tapestry\nrepresenting hunting and battle scenes, at the farther end, where the\nbed stood, the stone wall of the fourth side was covered with cloth of\nblue, embroidered with silver goshawks. Even now, in the ripe springtime\nof May, the room was still chilly, and a great fire roared and crackled\nin the huge gaping mouth of the stone fireplace. Not far from the blaze\nwere clustered the greater part of those present, buzzing in talk, now\nand then swelled by murmuring laughter. Some of those who knew Myles\nnodded to him, and two or three spoke to him as he stood waiting, whilst\nthe groom went forward to speak to the Earl; though what they said and\nwhat he answered, Myles, in his bewilderment and trepidation, hardly\nknew.\n\nAs was said before, the livery was the last meal of the day, and was\ntaken in bed. It was a simple repast--a manchette, or small loaf of\nbread of pure white flour, a loaf of household bread, sometimes a lump\nof cheese, and either a great flagon of ale or of sweet wine, warm\nand spiced. The Earl was sitting upright in bed, dressed in a furred\ndressing-gown, and propped up by two cylindrical bolsters of crimson\nsatin. Upon the coverlet, and spread over his knees, was a large wide\nnapkin of linen fringed with silver thread, and on it rested a silver\ntray containing the bread and some cheese. Two pages and three gentlemen\nwere waiting upon him, and Mad Noll, the jester, stood at the head of\nthe bed, now and then jingling his bawble and passing some quaint jest\nupon the chance of making his master smile. Upon a table near by were\nsome dozen or so waxen tapers struck upon as many spiked candlesticks\nof silver-gilt, and illuminating that end of the room with their bright\ntwinkling flames. One of the gentlemen was in the act of serving the\nEarl with a goblet of wine, poured from a silver ewer by one of the\nsquires, as the groom of the chamber came forward and spoke. The Earl,\ntaking the goblet, turned his head, and as Myles looked, their eyes met.\nThen the Earl turned away again and raised the cup to his lips, while\nMyles felt his heart beat more rapidly than ever.\n\nBut at last the meal was ended, and the Earl washed his hands and his\nmouth and his beard from a silver basin of scented water held by another\none of the squires. Then, leaning back against the pillows, he beckoned\nto Myles.\n\nIn answer Myles walked forward the length of the room, conscious that\nall eyes were fixed upon him. The Earl said something, and those who\nstood near drew back as he came forward. Then Myles found himself\nstanding beside the bed, looking down upon the quilted counterpane,\nfeeling that the other was gazing fixedly at him.\n\n\"I sent for thee,\" said the Earl at last, still looking steadily at\nhim, \"because this afternoon came a letter to my hand which thou hadst\nwritten to my niece, the Lady Alice. I have it here,\" said he, thrusting\nhis hand under the bolster, \"and have just now finished reading it.\"\nThen, after a moment's pause, whilst he opened the parchment and scanned\nit again, \"I find no matter of harm in it, but hereafter write no more\nsuch.\" He spoke entirely without anger, and Myles looked up in wonder.\n\"Here, take it,\" said the Earl, folding the letter and tossing it to\nMyles, who instinctively caught it, \"and henceforth trouble thou my\nniece no more either by letter or any other way. I thought haply thou\nwouldst be at some such saucy trick, and I made Alice promise to let me\nknow when it happed. Now, I say, let this be an end of the matter. Dost\nthou not know thou mayst injure her by such witless folly as that of\nmeeting her privily, and privily writing to her?\"\n\n\"I meant no harm,\" said Myles.\n\n\"I believe thee,\" said the Earl. \"That will do now; thou mayst go.\"\n\nMyles hesitated.\n\n\"What wouldst thou say?\" said Lord Mackworth.\n\n\"Only this,\" said Myles, \"an I have thy leave so to do, that the Lady\nAlice hath chosen me to be her knight, and so, whether I may see her or\nspeak with her or no, the laws of chivalry give me, who am gentle born,\nthe right to serve her as a true knight may.\"\n\n\"As a true fool may,\" said the Earl, dryly. \"Why, how now, thou art not\na knight yet, nor anything but a raw lump of a boy. What rights do the\nlaws of chivalry give thee, sirrah? Thou art a fool!\"\n\nHad the Earl been ever so angry, his words would have been less bitter\nto Myles than his cool, unmoved patience; it mortified his pride and\ngalled it to the quick.\n\n\"I know that thou dost hold me in contempt,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"Out upon thee!\" said the Earl, testily. \"Thou dost tease me beyond\npatience. I hold thee in contempt, forsooth! Why, look thee, hadst thou\nbeen other than thou art, I would have had thee whipped out of my house\nlong since. Thinkest thou I would have borne so patiently with another\none of ye squires had such an one held secret meeting with my daughter\nand niece, and tampered, as thou hast done, with my household, sending\nthrough one of my people that letter? Go to; thou art a fool, Myles\nFalworth!\"\n\nMyles stood staring at the Earl without making an effort to speak. The\nwords that he had heard suddenly flashed, as it were, a new light into\nhis mind. In that flash he fully recognized, and for the first time,\nthe strange and wonderful forbearance the great Earl had shown to him,\na poor obscure boy. What did it mean? Was Lord Mackworth his secret\nfriend, after all, as Gascoyne had more than once asserted? So Myles\nstood silent, thinking many things.\n\nMeantime the other lay back upon the cylindrical bolsters, looking\nthoughtfully at him. \"How old art thou?\" said he at last.\n\n\"Seventeen last April,\" answered Myles.\n\n\"Then thou art old enough to have some of the thoughts of a man, and to\nlay aside those of a boy. Haply thou hast had foolish things in thy\nhead this short time past; it is time that thou put them away. Harkee,\nsirrah! the Lady Alice is a great heiress in her own right, and mayst\ncommand the best alliance in England--an Earl--a Duke. She groweth apace\nto a woman, and then her kind lieth in Courts and great houses. As for\nthee, thou art but a poor lad, penniless and without friends to aid thee\nto open advancement. Thy father is attainted, and one whisper of where\nhe lieth hid would bring him thence to the Tower, and haply to the\nblock. Besides that, he hath an enemy, as Sir James Lee hath already\ntold thee--an enemy perhaps more great and powerful than myself. That\nenemy watcheth for thy father and for thee; shouldst thou dare raise thy\nhead or thy fortune ever so little, he would haply crop them both, and\nthat parlously quick. Myles Falworth, how dost thou dare to lift thine\neyes to the Lady Alice de Mowbray?\"\n\nPoor Myles stood silent and motionless. \"Sir,\" said he at last, in a\ndry choking voice, \"thou art right, and I have been a fool. Sir, I will\nnever raise mine eyes to look upon the Lady Alice more.\"\n\n\"I say not that either, boy,\" said the Earl; \"but ere thou dost so dare,\nthou must first place thyself and thy family whence ye fell. Till then,\nas thou art an honest man, trouble her not. Now get thee gone.\"\n\nAs Myles crossed the dark and silent courtyards, and looked up at the\nclear, still twinkle of the stars, he felt a kind of dull wonder that\nthey and the night and the world should seem so much the same, and he be\nso different.\n\nThe first stroke had been given that was to break in pieces his boyhood\nlife--the second was soon to follow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nThere are now and then times in the life of every one when new and\nstrange things occur with such rapidity that one has hardly time to\ncatch one's breath between the happenings. It is as though the old were\ncrumbling away--breaking in pieces--to give place to the new that is\nsoon to take its place.\n\nSo it was with Myles Falworth about this time. The very next day after\nthis interview in the bed-chamber, word came to him that Sir James Lee\nwished to speak with him in the office. He found the lean, grizzled old\nknight alone, sitting at the heavy oaken table with a tankard of spiced\nale at his elbow, and a dish of wafers and some fragments of cheese on a\npewter platter before him. He pointed to his clerk's seat--a joint stool\nsomewhat like a camp-chair, but made of heavy oaken braces and with a\nseat of hog-skin--and bade Myles be seated.\n\nIt was the first time that Myles had ever heard of such courtesy being\nextended to one of the company of squires, and, much wondering, he\nobeyed the invitation, or rather command, and took the seat.\n\nThe old knight sat regarding him for a while in silence, his one eye,\nas bright and as steady as that of a hawk, looking keenly from under the\npenthouse of its bushy brows, the while he slowly twirled and twisted\nhis bristling wiry mustaches, as was his wont when in meditation. At\nlast he broke the silence. \"How old art thou?\" said he, abruptly.\n\n\"I be turned seventeen last April,\" Myles answered, as he had the\nevening before to Lord Mackworth.\n\n\"Humph!\" said Sir James; \"thou be'st big of bone and frame for thine\nage. I would that thy heart were more that of a man likewise, and less\nthat of a giddy, hare-brained boy, thinking continually of naught but\nmischief.\"\n\nAgain he fell silent, and Myles sat quite still, wondering if it was\non account of any special one of his latest escapades that he had been\nsummoned to the office--the breaking of the window in the Long Hall by\nthe stone he had flung at the rook, or the climbing of the South Tower\nfor the jackdaw's nest.\n\n\"Thou hast a friend,\" said Sir James, suddenly breaking into his\nspeculations, \"of such a kind that few in this world possess. Almost\never since thou hast been here he hath been watching over thee. Canst\nthou guess of whom I speak?\"\n\n\"Haply it is Lord George Beaumont,\" said Myles; \"he hath always been\npassing kind to me.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Sir James, \"it is not of him that I speak, though methinks\nhe liketh thee well enow. Canst thou keep a secret, boy?\" he asked,\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Yea,\" answered Myles.\n\n\"And wilt thou do so in this case if I tell thee who it is that is thy\nbest friend here?\"\n\n\"Yea.\"\n\n\"Then it is my Lord who is that friend--the Earl himself; but see that\nthou breathe not a word of it.\"\n\nMyles sat staring at the old knight in utter and profound amazement, and\npresently Sir James continued: \"Yea, almost ever since thou hast come\nhere my Lord hath kept oversight upon all thy doings, upon all thy mad\npranks and thy quarrels and thy fights, thy goings out and comings in.\nWhat thinkest thou of that, Myles Falworth?\"\n\nAgain the old knight stopped and regarded the lad, who sat silent,\nfinding no words to answer. He seemed to find a grim pleasure in the\nyoungster's bewilderment and wonder. Then a sudden thought came to\nMyles.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"did my Lord know that I went to the privy garden as I\ndid?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Sir James; \"of that he knew naught at first until thy father\nbade thy mother write and tell him.\"\n\n\"My father!\" ejaculated Myles.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Sir James, twisting his mustaches more vigorously than ever.\n\"So soon as thy father heard of that prank, he wrote straightway to\nmy Lord that he should put a stop to what might in time have bred\nmischief.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Myles, in an almost breathless voice, \"I know not how to\nbelieve all these things, or whether I be awake or a-dreaming.\"\n\n\"Thou be'st surely enough awake,\" answered the old man; \"but there are\nother matters yet to be told. My Lord thinketh, as others of us do--Lord\nGeorge and myself--that it is now time for thee to put away thy boyish\nfollies, and learn those things appertaining to manhood. Thou hast been\nhere a year now, and hast had freedom to do as thou might list; but,\nboy,\"--and the old warrior spoke seriously, almost solemnly--\"upon thee\ndoth rest matters of such great import that did I tell them to thee thou\ncouldst not grasp them. My Lord deems that thou hast, mayhap, promise\nbeyond the common of men; ne'theless it remaineth yet to be seen an he\nbe right; it is yet to test whether that promise may be fulfilled. Next\nMonday I and Sir Everard Willoughby take thee in hand to begin training\nthee in the knowledge and the use of the jousting lance, of arms, and of\nhorsemanship. Thou art to go to Ralph Smith, and have him fit a suit of\nplain armor to thee which he hath been charged to make for thee against\nthis time. So get thee gone, think well over all these matters, and\nprepare thyself by next Monday. But stay, sirrah,\" he added, as Myles,\ndazed and bewildered, turned to obey; \"breathe to no living soul what\nI ha' told thee--that my Lord is thy friend--neither speak of anything\nconcerning him. Such is his own heavy command laid upon thee.\"\n\nThen Myles turned again without a word to leave the room. But as he\nreached the door Sir James stopped him a second time.\n\n\"Stay!\" he called. \"I had nigh missed telling thee somewhat else. My\nLord hath made thee a present this morning that thou wottest not of. It\nis\"--then he stopped for a few moments, perhaps to enjoy the full flavor\nof what he had to say--\"it is a great Flemish horse of true breed and\nright mettle; a horse such as a knight of the noblest strain might be\nproud to call his own. Myles Falworth, thou wert born upon a lucky day!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" cried Myles, and then stopped short. Then, \"Sir,\" he cried again,\n\"didst thou say it--the horse--was to be mine?\"\n\n\"Aye, it is to be thine.\"\n\n\"My very own?\"\n\n\"Thy very own.\"\n\nHow Myles Falworth left that place he never knew. He was like one in\nsome strange, some wonderful dream. He walked upon air, and his heart\nwas so full of joy and wonder and amazement that it thrilled almost to\nagony. Of course his first thought was of Gascoyne. How he ever found\nhim he never could tell, but find him he did.\n\n\"Come, Francis!\" he cried, \"I have that to tell thee so marvellous that\nhad it come upon me from paradise it could not be more strange.\"\n\nThen he dragged him away to their Eyry--it had been many a long day\nsince they had been there--and to all his friend's speeches, to all his\nwondering questions, he answered never a word until they had climbed the\nstairs, and so come to their old haunt. Then he spoke.\n\n\"Sit thee down, Francis,\" said he, \"till I tell thee that which passeth\nwonder.\" As Gascoyne obeyed, he himself stood looking about him. \"This\nis the last time I shall ever come hither,\" said he. And thereupon he\npoured out his heart to his listening friend in the murmuring solitude\nof the airy height. He did not speak of the Earl, but of the wonderful\nnew life that had thus suddenly opened before him, with its golden\nfuture of limitless hopes, of dazzling possibilities, of heroic\nambitions. He told everything, walking up and down the while--for he\ncould not remain quiet--his cheeks glowing and his eyes sparkling.\n\nGascoyne sat quite still, staring straight before him. He knew that his\nfriend was ruffling eagle pinions for a flight in which he could never\nhope to follow, and somehow his heart ached, for he knew that this must\nbe the beginning of the end of the dear, delightful friendship of the\nyear past.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nAnd so ended Myles Falworth's boyhood. Three years followed, during\nwhich he passed through that state which immediately follows boyhood in\nall men's lives--a time when they are neither lads nor grown men, but\nyouths passing from the one to the other period through what is often an\nuncouth and uncomfortable age.\n\nHe had fancied, when he talked with Gascoyne in the Eyry that time,\nthat he was to become a man all at once; he felt just then that he had\nforever done with boyish things. But that is not the way it happens in\nmen's lives. Changes do not come so suddenly and swiftly as that, but by\nlittle and little. For three or four days, maybe, he went his new way of\nlife big with the great change that had come upon him, and then, now\nin this and now in that, he drifted back very much into his old ways\nof boyish doings. As was said, one's young days do not end all at once,\neven when they be so suddenly and sharply shaken, and Myles was not\ndifferent from others. He had been stirred to the core by that first\nwonderful sight of the great and glorious life of manhood opening before\nhim, but he had yet many a sport to enjoy, many a game to play, many a\nboisterous romp to riot in the dormitory, many an expedition to make\nto copse and spinney and river on days when he was off duty, and when\npermission had been granted.\n\nNevertheless, there was a great and vital change in his life; a change\nwhich he hardly felt or realized. Even in resuming his old life there\nwas no longer the same vitality, the same zest, the same enjoyment in\nall these things. It seemed as though they were no longer a part of\nhimself. The savor had gone from them, and by-and-by it was pleasanter\nto sit looking on at the sports and the games of the younger lads than\nto take active part in them.\n\nThese three years of his life that had thus passed had been very full;\nfull mostly of work, grinding and monotonous; of training dull, dry,\nlaborious. For Sir James Lee was a taskmaster as hard as iron and\nseemingly as cold as a stone. For two, perhaps for three, weeks Myles\nentered into his new exercises with all the enthusiasm that novelty\nbrings; but these exercises hardly varied a tittle from day to day, and\nsoon became a duty, and finally a hard and grinding task. He used, in\nthe earlier days of his castle life, to hate the dull monotony of the\ntri-weekly hacking at the pels with a heavy broadsword as he hated\nnothing else; but now, though he still had that exercise to perform, it\nwas almost a relief from the heavy dulness of riding, riding, riding in\nthe tilt-yard with shield and lance--couch--recover--en passant.\n\nBut though he had nowadays but little time for boyish plays and\nescapades, his life was not altogether without relaxation. Now and\nthen he was permitted to drive in mock battle with other of the younger\nknights and bachelors in the paddock near the outer walls. It was a\nstill more welcome change in the routine of his life when, occasionally,\nhe would break a light lance in the tilting-court with Sir Everard\nWilloughby; Lord George, perhaps, and maybe one or two others of the\nHall folk, looking on.\n\nThen one gilded day, when Lord Dudleigh was visiting at Devlen, Myles\nran a course with a heavier lance in the presence of the Earl, who came\ndown to the tilt-yard with his guest to see the young novitiate ride\nagainst Sir Everard. He did his best, and did it well. Lord Dudleigh\npraised his poise and carriage, and Lord George, who was present, gave\nhim an approving smile and nod. But the Earl of Mackworth only sat\nstroking his beard impassively, as was his custom. Myles would have\ngiven much to know his thoughts.\n\nIn all these years Sir James Lee almost never gave any expression either\nof approbation or disapproval--excepting when Myles exhibited some\ncarelessness or oversight. Then his words were sharp and harsh enough.\nMore than once Myles's heart failed him, and bitter discouragement\ntook possession of him; then nothing but his bull-dog tenacity and\nstubbornness brought him out from the despondency of the dark hours.\n\n\"Sir,\" he burst out one day, when his heart was heavy with some failure,\n\"tell me, I beseech thee, do I get me any of skill at all? Is it in me\never to make a worthy knight, fit to hold lance and sword with other\nmen, or am I only soothly a dull heavy block, worth naught of any good?\"\n\n\"Thou art a fool, sirrah!\" answered Sir James, in his grimmest tones.\n\"Thinkest thou to learn all of knightly prowess in a year and a half?\nWait until thou art ripe, and then I will tell thee if thou art fit to\ncouch a lance or ride a course with a right knight.\"\n\n\"Thou art an old bear!\" muttered Myles to himself, as the old one-eyed\nknight turned on his heel and strode away. \"Beshrew me! an I show thee\nnot that I am as worthy to couch a lance as thou one of these fine\ndays!\"\n\nHowever, during the last of the three years the grinding routine of his\ntraining had not been quite so severe as at first. His exercises took\nhim more often out into the fields, and it was during this time of his\nknightly education that he sometimes rode against some of the castle\nknights in friendly battle with sword or lance or wooden mace. In these\nencounters he always held his own; and held it more than well, though,\nin his boyish simplicity, he was altogether unconscious of his own\nskill, address, and strength. Perhaps it was his very honest modesty\nthat made him so popular and so heartily liked by all.\n\nHe had by this time risen to the place of head squire or chief bachelor,\nholding the same position that Walter Blunt had occupied when he himself\nhad first come, a raw country boy, to Devlen. The lesser squires\nand pages fairly worshipped him as a hero, albeit imposing upon his\ngood-nature. All took a pride in his practice in knightly exercises, and\nfabulous tales were current among the young fry concerning his strength\nand skill.\n\nYet, although Myles was now at the head of his class, he did not,\nas other chief bachelors had done, take a leading position among the\nsquires in the Earl's household service. Lord Mackworth, for his own\ngood reasons, relegated him to the position of Lord George's especial\nattendant. Nevertheless, the Earl always distinguished him from the\nother esquires, giving him a cool nod whenever they met; and Myles, upon\nhis part--now that he had learned better to appreciate how much his Lord\nhad done for him--would have shed the last drop of blood in his veins\nfor the head of the house of Beaumont.\n\nAs for the two young ladies, he often saw them, and sometimes, even\nin the presence of the Earl, exchanged a few words with them, and Lord\nMackworth neither forbade it nor seemed to notice it.\n\nTowards the Lady Anne he felt the steady friendly regard of a lad for a\ngirl older than himself; towards the Lady Alice, now budding into ripe\nyoung womanhood, there lay deep in his heart the resolve to be some day\nher true knight in earnest as he had been her knight in pretence in that\ntime of boyhood when he had so perilously climbed into the privy garden.\n\nIn body and form he was now a man, and in thought and heart was quickly\nripening to manhood, for, as was said before, men matured quickly in\nthose days. He was a right comely youth, for the promise of his boyish\nbody had been fulfilled in a tall, powerful, well-knit frame. His face\nwas still round and boyish, but on cheek and chin and lip was the curl\nof adolescent beard--soft, yellow, and silky. His eyes were as blue\nas steel, and quick and sharp in glance as those of a hawk; and as he\nwalked, his arms swung from his broad, square shoulders, and his body\nswayed with pent-up strength ready for action at any moment.\n\nIf little Lady Alice, hearing much talk of his doings and of his promise\nin these latter times, thought of him now and then it is a matter not\naltogether to be wondered at.\n\nSuch were the changes that three years had wrought. And from now the\nstory of his manhood really begins.\n\n\nPerhaps in all the history of Devlen Castle, even at this, the high tide\nof pride and greatness of the house of Beaumont, the most notable time\nwas in the early autumn of the year 1411, when for five days King Henry\nIV was entertained by the Earl of Mackworth. The King was at that time\nmaking a progress through certain of the midland counties, and with him\ntravelled the Comte de Vermoise. The Count was the secret emissary of\nthe Dauphin's faction in France, at that time in the very bitterest\nintensity of the struggle with the Duke of Burgundy, and had come to\nEngland seeking aid for his master in his quarrel.\n\nIt was not the first time that royalty had visited Devlen. Once, in Earl\nRobert's day, King Edward II had spent a week at the castle during the\nperiod of the Scottish wars. But at that time it was little else than a\nmilitary post, and was used by the King as such. Now the Beaumonts were\nin the very flower of their prosperity, and preparations were made\nfor the coming visit of royalty upon a scale of such magnificence and\nsplendor as Earl Robert, or perhaps even King Edward himself, had never\ndreamed.\n\nFor weeks the whole castle had been alive with folk hurrying hither and\nthither; and with the daily and almost hourly coming of pack-horses,\nladen with bales and boxes, from London. From morning to night one heard\nthe ceaseless chip-chipping of the masons' hammers, and saw carriers\nof stones and mortar ascending and descending the ladders of the\nscaffolding that covered the face of the great North Hall. Within, that\npart of the building was alive with the scraping of the carpenters'\nsaws, the clattering of lumber, and the rapping and banging of hammers.\n\nThe North Hall had been assigned as the lodging place for the King and\nhis court, and St. George's Hall (as the older building adjoining it was\ncalled) had been set apart as the lodging of the Comte de Vermoise and\nthe knights and gentlemen attendant upon him.\n\nThe great North Hall had been very much altered and changed for the\naccommodation of the King and his people; a beautiful gallery of carved\nwood-work had been built within and across the south end of the room for\nthe use of the ladies who were to look down upon the ceremonies below.\nTwo additional windows had been cut through the wall and glazed, and\npassage-ways had been opened connecting with the royal apartments\nbeyond. In the bedchamber a bed of carved wood and silver had been\nbuilt into the wall, and had been draped with hangings of pale blue and\nsilver, and a magnificent screen of wrought-iron and carved wood had\nbeen erected around the couch; rich and beautiful tapestries brought\nfrom Italy and Flanders were hung upon the walls; cushions of velvets\nand silks stuffed with down covered benches and chairs. The floor of\nthe hall was spread with mats of rushes stained in various colors, woven\ninto curious patterns, and in the smaller rooms precious carpets of\narras were laid on the cold stones.\n\nAll of the cadets of the House had been assembled; all of the\ngentlemen in waiting, retainers and clients. The castle seemed full to\noverflowing; even the dormitory of the squires was used as a lodging\nplace for many of the lesser gentry.\n\nSo at last, in the midst of all this bustle of preparation, came the day\nof days when the King was to arrive. The day before a courier had come\nbringing the news that he was lodging at Donaster Abbey overnight, and\nwould make progress the next day to Devlen.\n\nThat morning, as Myles was marshalling the pages and squires, and, with\nthe list of names in his hand, was striving to evolve some order out\nof the confusion, assigning the various individuals their special\nduties--these to attend in the household, those to ride in the\nescort--one of the gentlemen of Lord George's household came with an\norder for him to come immediately to the young nobleman's apartments.\nMyles hastily turned over his duties to Gascoyne and Wilkes, and then\nhurried after the messenger. He found Lord George in the antechamber,\nthree gentlemen squires arming him in a magnificent suit of ribbed\nMilan.\n\nHe greeted Myles with a nod and a smile as the lad entered. \"Sirrah,\"\nsaid he, \"I have had a talk with Mackworth this morn concerning thee,\nand have a mind to do thee an honor in my poor way. How wouldst thou\nlike to ride to-day as my special squire of escort?\"\n\nMyles flushed to the roots of his hair. \"Oh, sir!\" he cried, eagerly,\n\"an I be not too ungainly for thy purpose, no honor in all the world\ncould be such joy to me as that!\"\n\nLord George laughed. \"A little matter pleases thee hugely,\" said he;\n\"but as to being ungainly, who so sayeth that of thee belieth thee,\nMyles; thou art not ungainly, sirrah. But that is not to the point. I\nhave chosen thee for my equerry to-day; so make thou haste and don thine\narmor, and then come hither again, and Hollingwood will fit thee with a\nwreathed bascinet I have within, and a juppon embroidered with my arms\nand colors.\"\n\nWhen Myles had made his bow and left his patron, he flew across the\nquadrangle, and burst into the armory upon Gascoyne, whom he found still\nlingering there, chatting with one or two of the older bachelors.\n\n\"What thinkest thou, Francis?\" he cried, wild with excitement. \"An honor\nhath been done me this day I could never have hoped to enjoy. Out of\nall this household, Lord George hath chose me his equerry for the day to\nride to meet the King. Come, hasten to help me to arm! Art thou not glad\nof this thing for my sake, Francis?\"\n\n\"Aye, glad am I indeed!\" cried Gascoyne, that generous friend; \"rather\nalmost would I have this befall thee than myself!\" And indeed he was\nhardly less jubilant than Myles over the honor.\n\nFive minutes later he was busy arming him in the little room at the end\nof the dormitory which had been lately set apart for the use of the head\nbachelor. \"And to think,\" he said, looking up as he kneeled, strapping\nthe thigh-plates to his friend's legs, \"that he should have chosen thee\nbefore all others of the fine knights and lords and gentlemen of quality\nthat are here!\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Myles, \"it passeth wonder. I know not why he should so\nsingle me out for such an honor. It is strangely marvellous.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Gascoyne, \"there is no marvel in it, and I know right well\nwhy he chooseth thee. It is because he sees, as we all see, that thou\nart the stoutest and the best-skilled in arms, and most easy of carriage\nof any man in all this place.\"\n\nMyles laughed. \"An thou make sport of me,\" said he, \"I'll rap thy head\nwith this dagger hilt. Thou art a silly fellow, Francis, to talk so. But\ntell me, hast thou heard who rides with my Lord?\"\n\n\"Yea, I heard Wilkes say anon that it was Sir James Lee.\"\n\n\"I am right glad of that,\" said Myles; \"for then he will show me what to\ndo and how to bear myself. It frights me to think what would hap should\nI make some mistake in my awkwardness. Methinks Lord George would never\nhave me with him more should I do amiss this day.\"\n\n\"Never fear,\" said Gascoyne; \"thou wilt not do amiss.\"\n\nAnd now, at last, the Earl, Lord George, and all their escort were\nready; then the orders were given to horse, the bugle sounded, and away\nthey all rode, with clashing of iron hoofs and ringing and jingling\nof armor, out into the dewy freshness of the early morning, the slant\nyellow sun of autumn blazing and flaming upon polished helmets and\nshields, and twinkling like sparks of fire upon spear points. Myles's\nheart thrilled within him for pure joy, and he swelled out his sturdy\nyoung breast with great draughts of the sweet fresh air that came\nsinging across the sunny hill-tops. Sir James Lee, who acted as the\nEarl's equerry for the day, rode at a little distance, and there was an\nalmost pathetic contrast between the grim, steadfast impassiveness of\nthe tough old warrior and Myles's passionate exuberance of youth.\n\nAt the head of the party rode the Earl and his brother side by side,\neach clad cap-a-pie in a suit of Milan armor, the cuirass of each\ncovered with a velvet juppon embroidered in silver with the arms and\nquarterings of the Beaumonts. The Earl wore around his neck an \"S S\"\ncollar, with a jewelled St. George hanging from it, and upon his head a\nvizored bascinet, ornamented with a wreath covered with black and yellow\nvelvet and glistening with jewels.\n\nLord George, as was said before, was clad in a beautiful suit of ribbed\nMilan armor. It was rimmed with a thin thread of gold, and, like his\nbrother, he wore a bascinet wreathed with black and yellow velvet.\n\nBehind the two brothers and their equerries rode the rest in their\nproper order--knights, gentlemen, esquires, men-at-arms--to the number,\nperhaps, of two hundred and fifty; spears and lances aslant, and\nbanners, permons, and pencels of black and yellow fluttering in the warm\nSeptember air.\n\nFrom the castle to the town they rode, and then across the bridge, and\nthence clattering up through the stony streets, where the folk looked\ndown upon them from the windows above, or crowded the fronts of the\nshops of the tradesmen. Lusty cheers were shouted for the Earl, but the\ngreat Lord rode staring ever straight before him, as unmoved as a stone.\nThen out of the town they clattered, and away in a sweeping cloud of\ndust across the country-side.\n\nIt was not until they had reached the windy top of Willoughby Croft, ten\nmiles away, that they met the King and his company. As the two parties\napproached to within forty or fifty yards of one another they stopped.\n\nAs they came to a halt, Myles observed that a gentleman dressed in\na plain blue-gray riding-habit, and sitting upon a beautiful white\ngelding, stood a little in advance of the rest of the party, and he knew\nthat that must be the King. Then Sir James nodded to Myles, and leaping\nfrom his horse, flung the reins to one of the attendants. Myles did\nthe like; and then, still following Sir James's lead as he served\nLord Mackworth, went forward and held Lord George's stirrup while he\ndismounted. The two noblemen quickly removed each his bascinet, and\nMyles, holding the bridle-rein of Lord George's horse with his left\nhand, took the helmet in his right, resting it upon his hip.\n\nThen the two brothers walked forward bare-headed, the Earl, a little in\nadvance. Reaching the King he stopped, and then bent his knee--stiffly\nin the armored plates--until it touched the ground. Thereupon the King\nreached him his hand, and he, rising again, took it, and set it to his\nlips.\n\nThen Lord George, advancing, kneeled as his brother had kneeled, and to\nhim also the King gave his hand.\n\nMyles could hear nothing, but he could see that a few words of greeting\npassed between the three, and then the King, turning, beckoned to a\nknight who stood just behind him and a little in advance of the others\nof the troop. In answer, the knight rode forward; the King spoke a few\nwords of introduction, and the stranger, ceremoniously drawing off his\nright gauntlet, clasped the hand, first of the Earl, and then of Lord\nGeorge. Myles knew that he must be the great Comte de Vermoise, of whom\nhe had heard so much of late.\n\nA few moments of conversation followed, and then the King bowed\nslightly. The French nobleman instantly reined back his horse, an order\nwas given, and then the whole company moved forward, the two brothers\nwalking upon either side of the King, the Earl lightly touching the\nbridle-rein with his bare hand.\n\nWhilst all this was passing, the Earl of Mackworth's company had been\ndrawn up in a double line along the road-side, leaving the way open to\nthe other party. As the King reached the head of the troop, another halt\nfollowed while he spoke a few courteous words of greeting to some of the\nlesser nobles attendant upon the Earl whom he knew.\n\nIn that little time he was within a few paces of Myles, who stood\nmotionless as a statue, holding the bascinet and the bridle-rein of Lord\nGeorge's horse.\n\nWhat Myles saw was a plain, rather stout man, with a face fat, smooth,\nand waxy, with pale-blue eyes, and baggy in the lids; clean shaven,\nexcept for a mustache and tuft covering lips and chin. Somehow he felt\na deep disappointment. He had expected to see something lion-like,\nsomething regal, and, after all, the great King Henry was commonplace,\nfat, unwholesome-looking. It came to him with a sort of a shock that,\nafter all, a King was in nowise different from other men.\n\nMeanwhile the Earl and his brother replaced their bascinets, and\npresently the whole party moved forward upon the way to Mackworth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nThat same afternoon the squires' quarters were thrown into such a\nferment of excitement as had, perhaps, never before stirred them. About\none o'clock in the afternoon the Earl himself and Lord George came\nwalking slowly across the Armory Court wrapped in deep conversation, and\nentered Sir James Lee's office.\n\nAll the usual hubbub of noise that surrounded the neighborhood of the\ndormitory and the armory was stilled at their coming, and when the two\nnoblemen had entered Sir James's office, the lads and young men gathered\nin knots discussing with an almost awesome interest what that visit\nmight portend.\n\nAfter some time Sir James Lee came to the door at the head of the long\nflight of stone steps, and whistling, beckoned one of the smaller pages\nto him. He gave a short order that sent the little fellow flying on some\nmission. In the course of a few minutes he returned, hurrying across\nthe stony court with Myles Falworth, who presently entered Sir James's\noffice. It was then and at this sight that the intense half-suppressed\nexcitement reached its height of fever-heat. What did it all mean? The\nair was filled with a thousand vague, wild rumors--but the very wildest\nsurmises fell short of the real truth.\n\nPerhaps Myles was somewhat pale when he entered the office; certainly\nhis nerves were in a tremor, for his heart told him that something very\nportentous was about to befall him. The Earl sat at the table, and in\nthe seat that Sir James Lee usually occupied; Lord George half sat, half\nleaned in the window-place. Sir James stood with his back to the\nempty fireplace, and his hands clasped behind him. All three were very\nserious.\n\n\"Give thee good den, Myles Falworth,\" said the Earl, as Myles bowed\nfirst to him and then to the others; \"and I would have thee prepare\nthyself for a great happening.\" Then, continuing directly to the point:\n\"Thou knowest, sirrah, why we have been training thee so closely these\nthree years gone; it is that thou shouldst be able to hold thine own\nin the world. Nay, not only hold thine own, but to show thyself to be\na knight of prowess shouldst it come to a battle between thee and thy\nfather's enemy; for there lieth no half-way place for thee, and thou\nmust be either great or else nothing. Well, sir, the time hath now come\nfor thee to show thy mettle. I would rather have chosen that thou hadst\nlabored a twelvemonth longer; but now, as I said, hath come a chance to\nprove thyself that may never come again. Sir James tells me that thou\nart passably ripe in skill. Thou must now show whether that be so or no.\nHast thou ever heard of the Sieur de la Montaigne?\"\n\n\"Yea, my Lord. I have heard of him often,\" answered Myles. \"It was he\nwho won the prize at the great tourney at Rochelle last year.\"\n\n\"I see that thou hast his fame pat to thy tongue's end,\" said the Earl;\n\"he is the chevalier of whom I speak, and he is reckoned the best knight\nof Dauphiny. That one of which thou spokest was the third great tourney\nin which he was adjudged the victor. I am glad that thou holdest his\nprowess highly. Knowest thou that he is in the train of the Comte de\nVermoise?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles, flushing; \"I did hear news he was in England, but\nknew not that he was in this place.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Lord Mackworth; \"he is here.\" He paused for a moment; then\nsaid, suddenly. \"Tell me, Myles Falworth, an thou wert a knight and of\nrank fit to run a joust with the Sieur de la Montaigne, wouldst thou\ndare encounter him in the lists?\"\n\nThe Earl's question fell upon Myles so suddenly and unexpectedly that\nfor a moment or so he stood staring at the speaker with mouth agape.\nMeanwhile the Earl sat looking calmly back at him, slowly stroking his\nbeard the while.\n\nIt was Sir James Lee's voice that broke the silence. \"Thou heardst thy\nLord speak,\" said he, harshly. \"Hast thou no tongue to answer, sirrah?\"\n\n\"Be silent, Lee,\" said Lord Mackworth, quietly. \"Let the lad have time\nto think before he speaketh.\"\n\nThe sound of the words aroused Myles. He advanced to the table, and\nrested his hand upon it. \"My Lord--my Lord,\" said he, \"I know not what\nto say, I--I am amazed and afeard.\"\n\n\"How! how!\" cried Sir James Lee, harshly. \"Afeard, sayst thou? An thou\nart afeard, thou knave, thou needst never look upon my face or speak to\nme more! I have done with thee forever an thou art afeard even were the\nchampion a Sir Alisander.\"\n\n\"Peace, peace, Lee,\" said the Earl, holding up his hand. \"Thou art too\nhasty. The lad shall have his will in this matter, and thou and no one\nshall constrain him. Methinks, also, thou dost not understand him. Speak\nfrom thy heart, Myles; why art thou afraid?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Myles, \"I am so young, sir; I am but a raw boy. How\nshould I dare be so hardy as to venture to set lance against such an one\nas the Sieur de la Montaigne? What would I be but a laughing-stock for\nall the world who would see me so foolish as to venture me against one\nof such prowess and skill?\"\n\n\"Nay, Myles,\" said Lord George, \"thou thinkest not well enough of thine\nown skill and prowess. Thinkest thou we would undertake to set thee\nagainst him, an we did not think that thou couldst hold thine own fairly\nwell?\"\n\n\"Hold mine own?\" cried Myles, turning to Lord George. \"Sir; thou dost\nnot mean--thou canst not mean, that I may hope or dream to hold mine own\nagainst the Sieur de la Montaigne.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Lord George, \"that was what I did mean.\"\n\n\"Come, Myles,\" said the Earl; \"now tell me: wilt thou fight the Sieur de\nla Montaigne?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Myles, drawing himself to his full height and throwing out\nhis chest. \"Yea,\" and his cheeks and forehead flushed red; \"an thou bid\nme do so, I will fight him.\"\n\n\"There spake my brave lad!\" cried Lord George heartily.\n\n\"I give thee joy, Myles,\" said the Earl, reaching him his hand, which\nMyles took and kissed. \"And I give thee double joy. I have talked with\nthe King concerning thee this morning, and he hath consented to knight\nthee--yea, to knight thee with all honors of the Bath--provided thou\nwilt match thee against the Sieur de la Montaigne for the honor of\nEngland and Mackworth. Just now the King lieth to sleep for a little\nwhile after his dinner; have thyself in readiness when he cometh forth,\nand I will have thee presented.\"\n\nThen the Earl turned to Sir James Lee, and questioned him as to how the\nbachelors were fitted with clothes. Myles listened, only half hearing\nthe words through the tumbling of his thoughts. He had dreamed in his\nday-dreams that some time he might be knighted, but that time always\nseemed very, very distant. To be knighted now, in his boyhood, by the\nKing, with the honors of the Bath, and under the patronage of the\nEarl of Mackworth; to joust--to actually joust--with the Sieur de la\nMontaigne, one of the most famous chevaliers of France! No wonder he\nonly half heard the words; half heard the Earl's questions concerning\nhis clothes and the discussion which followed; half heard Lord George\nvolunteer to array him in fitting garments from his own wardrobe.\n\n\"Thou mayst go now,\" said the Earl, at last turning to him. \"But be thou\nat George's apartments by two of the clock to be dressed fittingly for\nthe occasion.\"\n\nThen Myles went out stupefied, dazed, bewildered. He looked around,\nbut he did not see Gascoyne. He said not a word to any of the others in\nanswer to the eager questions poured upon him by his fellow-squires,\nbut walked straight away. He hardly knew where he went, but by-and-by\nhe found himself in a grassy angle below the end of the south stable; a\nspot overlooking the outer wall and the river beyond. He looked around;\nno one was near, and he flung himself at length, burying his face in\nhis arms. How long he lay there he did not know, but suddenly some\none touched him upon the shoulder, and he sprang up quickly. It was\nGascoyne.\n\n\"What is to do, Myles?\" said his friend, anxiously. \"What is all this\ntalk I hear concerning thee up yonder at the armory?\"\n\n\"Oh, Francis!\" cried Myles, with a husky choking voice: \"I am to be\nknighted--by the King--by the King himself; and I--I am to fight the\nSieur de la Montaigne.\"\n\nHe reached out his hand, and Gascoyne took it. They stood for a while\nquite silent, and when at last the stillness was broken, it was Gascoyne\nwho spoke, in a choking voice.\n\n\"Thou art going to be great, Myles,\" said he. \"I always knew that it\nmust be so with thee, and now the time hath come. Yea, thou wilt be\ngreat, and live at court amongst noble folk, and Kings haply. Presently\nthou wilt not be with me any more, and wilt forget me by-and-by.\"\n\n\"Nay, Francis, never will I forget thee!\" answered Myles, pressing\nhis friend's hand. \"I will always love thee better than any one in the\nworld, saving only my father and my mother.\"\n\nGascoyne shook his head and looked away, swallowing at the dry lump in\nhis throat. Suddenly he turned to Myles. \"Wilt thou grant me a boon?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" answered Myles. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"That thou wilt choose me for thy squire.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles; \"how canst thou think to serve me as squire? Thou\nwilt be a knight thyself some day, Francis, and why dost thou wish now\nto be my squire?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Gascoyne, with a short laugh, \"I would rather be in thy\ncompany as a squire than in mine own as a knight, even if I might be\nbanneret.\"\n\nMyles flung his arm around his friend's neck, and kissed him upon the\ncheek. \"Thou shalt have thy will,\" said he; \"but whether knight or\nsquire, thou art ever mine own true friend.\"\n\nThen they went slowly back together, hand in hand, to the castle world\nagain.\n\nAt two o'clock Myles went to Lord George's apartments, and there his\nfriend and patron dressed him out in a costume better fitted for the\nceremony of presentation--a fur-trimmed jacket of green brocaded velvet\nembroidered with golden thread, a black velvet hood-cap rolled like a\nturban and with a jewel in the front, a pair of crimson hose, and a pair\nof black velvet shoes trimmed and stitched with gold-thread. Myles had\nnever worn such splendid clothes in his life before, and he could not\nbut feel that they became him well.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, as he looked down at himself, \"sure it is not lawful for\nme to wear such clothes as these.\"\n\nIn those days there was a law, known as a sumptuary law, which regulated\nby statute the clothes that each class of people were privileged to\nwear. It was, as Myles said, against the law for him to wear such\ngarments as those in which he was clad--either velvet, crimson stuff,\nfur or silver or gold embroidery--nevertheless such a solemn ceremony as\npresentation to the King excused the temporary overstepping of the law,\nand so Lord George told him. As he laid his hand upon the lad's shoulder\nand held him off at arm's-length, he added, \"And I pledge thee my word,\nMyles, that thou art as lusty and handsome a lad as ever mine eyes\nbeheld.\"\n\n\"Thou art very kind to me, sir,\" said Myles, in answer.\n\nLord George laughed; and then giving him a shake, let go his shoulder.\n\nIt was about three o'clock when little Edmond de Montefort, Lord\nMackworth's favorite page, came with word that the King was then walking\nin the Earl's pleasance.\n\n\"Come, Myles,\" said Lord George, and then Myles arose from the\nseat where he had been sitting, his heart palpitating and throbbing\ntumultuously.\n\nAt the wicket-gate of the pleasance two gentlemen-at-arms stood guard in\nhalf-armor; they saluted Lord George, and permitted him to pass with his\nprotege. As he laid his hand upon the latch of the wicket he paused for\na moment and turned.\n\n\"Myles,\" said he, in a low voice, \"thou art a thoughtful and cautious\nlad; for thy father's sake be thoughtful and cautious now. Do not\nspeak his name or betray that thou art his son.\" Then he opened the\nwicket-gate and entered.\n\nAny lad of Myles's age, even one far more used to the world than he,\nwould perhaps have felt all the oppression that he experienced under the\nweight of such a presentation. He hardly knew what he was doing as\nLord George led him to where the King stood, a little apart from\nthe attendants, with the Earl and the Comte de Vermoise. Even in his\nconfusion he knew enough to kneel, and somehow his honest, modest\ndiffidence became the young fellow very well. He was not awkward, for\none so healthful in mind and body as he could not bear himself very ill,\nand he felt the assurance that in Lord George he had a kind friend at\nhis side, and one well used to court ceremonies to lend him countenance.\nThen there is something always pleasing in frank, modest manliness such\nas was stamped on Myles's handsome, sturdy face. No doubt the King's\nheart warmed towards the fledgling warrior kneeling in the pathway\nbefore him. He smiled very kindly as he gave the lad his hand to kiss,\nand that ceremony done, held fast to the hard, brown, sinewy fist of the\nyoung man with his soft white hand, and raised him to his feet.\n\n\"By the mass!\" said he, looking Myles over with smiling eyes, \"thou art\na right champion in good sooth. Such as thou art haply was Sir Galahad\nwhen he came to Arthur's court. And so they tell me, thou hast stomach\nto brook the Sieur de la Montaigne, that tough old boar of Dauphiny.\nHast thou in good sooth the courage to face him? Knowest thou what a\ngreat thing it is that thou hast set upon thyself--to do battle, even in\nsport, with him?\"\n\n\"Yea, your Majesty,\" answered Myles, \"well I wot it is a task haply\nbeyond me. But gladly would I take upon me even a greater venture, and\none more dangerous, to do your Majesty's pleasure!\"\n\nThe King looked pleased. \"Now that was right well said, young man,\" said\nhe, \"and I like it better that it came from such young and honest lips.\nDost thou speak French?\"\n\n\"Yea, your Majesty,\" answered Myles. \"In some small measure do I so.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that,\" said the King; \"for so I may make thee acquainted\nwith Sieur de la Montaigne.\"\n\nHe turned as he ended speaking, and beckoned to a heavy, thick-set,\nblack-browed chevalier who stood with the other gentlemen attendants at\na little distance. He came instantly forward in answer to the summons,\nand the King introduced the two to one another. As each took the other\nformally by the hand, he measured his opponent hastily, body and limb,\nand perhaps each thought that he had never seen a stronger, stouter,\nbetter-knit man than the one upon whom he looked. But nevertheless\nthe contrast betwixt the two was very great--Myles, young, boyish,\nfresh-faced; the other, bronzed, weather beaten, and seamed with a great\nwhite scar that ran across his forehead and cheek; the one a novice, the\nother a warrior seasoned in twoscore battles.\n\nA few polite phrases passed between the two, the King listening smiling,\nbut with an absent and far-away look gradually stealing upon his face.\nAs they ended speaking, a little pause of silence followed, and then the\nKing suddenly aroused himself.\n\n\"So,\" said he, \"I am glad that ye two are acquainted. And now we will\nleave our youthful champion in thy charge, Beaumont--and in thine, Mon\nSieur, as well--and so soon as the proper ceremonies are ended, we will\ndub him knight with our own hands. And now, Mackworth, and thou my Lord\nCount, let us walk a little; I have bethought me further concerning\nthese threescore extra men for Dauphiny.\"\n\nThen Myles withdrew, under the charge of Lord George and the Sieur de\nla Montaigne and while the King and the two nobles walked slowly up and\ndown the gravel path between the tall rose-bushes, Myles stood\ntalking with the gentlemen attendants, finding himself, with a certain\ntriumphant exultation, the peer of any and the hero of the hour.\n\nThat night was the last that Myles and Gascoyne spent lodging in the\ndormitory in their squirehood service. The next day they were assigned\napartments in Lord George's part of the house, and thither they\ntransported themselves and their belongings, amid the awestruck wonder\nand admiration of their fellow-squires.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\nIn Myles Falworth's day one of the greatest ceremonies of courtly life\nwas that of the bestowal of knighthood by the King, with the honors of\nthe Bath. By far the greater number of knights were at that time created\nby other knights, or by nobles, or by officers of the crown. To be\nknighted by the King in person distinguished the recipient for life. It\nwas this signal honor that the Earl, for his own purposes, wished Myles\nto enjoy, and for this end he had laid not a few plans.\n\nThe accolade was the term used for the creation of a knight upon the\nfield of battle. It was a reward of valor or of meritorious service, and\nwas generally bestowed in a more or less off-hand way; but the ceremony\nof the Bath was an occasion of the greatest courtly moment, and it was\nthus that Myles Falworth was to be knighted in addition to the honor of\na royal belting.\n\nA quaint old book treating of knighthood and chivalry gives a full and\ndetailed account of all the circumstances of the ceremony of a creation\nof a Knight of the Bath. It tells us that the candidate was first\nplaced under the care of two squires of honor, \"grave and well seen in\ncourtship and nurture, and also in feats of chivalry,\" which same were\nlikewise to be governors in all things relating to the coming honors.\n\nFirst of all, the barber shaved him, and cut his hair in a certain\npeculiar fashion ordained for the occasion, the squires of honor\nsupervising the operation. This being concluded, the candidate was\nsolemnly conducted to the chamber where the bath of tepid water was\nprepared, \"hung within and without with linen, and likewise covered\nwith rich cloths and embroidered linen.\" While in the bath two \"ancient,\ngrave, and reverend knights\" attended the bachelor, giving him \"meet\ninstructions in the order and feats of chivalry.\" The candidate was then\nexamined as to his knowledge and acquirements, and then, all questions\nbeing answered to the satisfaction of his examiners, the elder of the\ntwo dipped a handful of water out from the bath, and poured it upon his\nhead, at the same time signing his left shoulder with the sign of the\ncross.\n\nAs soon as this ceremony was concluded, the two squires of honor helped\ntheir charge from the bath, and conducted him to a plain bed without\nhangings, where they let him rest until his body was warm and dry.\nThen they clad him in a white linen shirt, and over it a plain robe of\nrusset, \"girdled about the loins with a rope, and having a hood like\nunto a hermit.\"\n\nAs soon as the candidate had arisen, the two \"ancient knights\" returned,\nand all being in readiness he was escorted to the chapel, the two\nwalking, one upon either side of him, his squires of honor marching\nbefore, and the whole party preceded by \"sundry minstrels making a loud\nnoise of music.\"\n\nWhen they came to the chapel, the two knights who escorted him took\nleave of the candidate, each saluting him with a kiss upon the cheek.\nNo one remained with him but his squires of honor, the priest, and the\nchandler.\n\nIn the mean time the novitiate's armor, sword, lance, and helmet had\nbeen laid in readiness before the altar. These he watched and guarded\nwhile the others slept, keeping vigil until sunrise, during which time\n\"he shall,\" says the ancient authority, \"pass the night in orisons,\nprayers, and meditation.\" At daylight he confessed to the priest, heard\nmatins, and communicated in mass, and then presented a lighted candle\nat the altar, with a piece of money stuck in it as close to the flame\nas could be done, the candle being offered to the honor of God, and the\nmoney to the honor of that person who was to make him a knight.\n\nSo concluded the sacred ceremony, which being ended his squires\nconducted the candidate to his chamber, and there made him comfortable,\nand left him to repose for a while before the second and final part of\nthe ordinance.\n\nSuch is a shortened account of the preparatory stages of the ceremonies\nthrough which Myles Falworth passed.\n\nMatters had come upon him so suddenly one after the other, and had come\nwith such bewildering rapidity that all that week was to him like some\nstrange, wonderful, mysterious vision. He went through it all like one\nin a dream. Lord George Beaumont was one of his squires of honor; the\nother, by way of a fitting complement to the courage of the chivalrous\nlad, was the Sieur de la Montaigne, his opponent soon to be. They were\nwell versed in everything relating to knightcraft, and Myles followed\nall their directions with passive obedience. Then Sir James Lee and the\nComte de Vermoise administered the ceremony of the Bath, the old knight\nexamining him in the laws of chivalry.\n\nIt occurs perhaps once or twice in one's lifetime that one passes\nthrough great happenings--sometimes of joy, sometimes of dreadful\nbitterness--in just such a dazed state as Myles passed through this. It\nis only afterwards that all comes back to one so sharply and keenly that\nthe heart thrills almost in agony in living it over again. But perhaps\nof all the memory of that time, when it afterwards came back piece by\npiece, none was so clear to Myles's back-turned vision as the long\nnight spent in the chapel, watching his armor, thinking such wonderful\nthoughts, and dreaming such wonderful wide-eyed dreams. At such times\nMyles saw again the dark mystery of the castle chapel; he saw again the\nhalf-moon gleaming white and silvery through the tall, narrow window,\nand throwing a broad form of still whiteness across stone floor, empty\nseats, and still, motionless figures of stone effigies. At such times\nhe stood again in front of the twinkling tapers that lit the altar where\nhis armor lay piled in a heap, heard again the deep breathing of his\ncompanions of the watch sleeping in some empty stall, wrapped each in\nhis cloak, and saw the old chandler bestir himself, and rise and come\nforward to snuff the candles. At such times he saw again the day growing\nclearer and clearer through the tall, glazed windows, saw it change to\na rosy pink, and then to a broad, ruddy glow that threw a halo of light\naround Father Thomas's bald head bowed in sleep, and lit up the banners\nand trophies hanging motionless against the stony face of the west wall;\nheard again the stirring of life without and the sound of his companions\narousing themselves; saw them come forward, and heard them wish him joy\nthat his long watch was ended.\n\n\nIt was nearly noon when Myles was awakened from a fitful sleep by\nGascoyne bringing in his dinner, but, as might be supposed, he had but\nlittle hunger, and ate sparingly. He had hardly ended his frugal meal\nbefore his two squires of honor came in, followed by a servant carrying\nthe garments for the coming ceremony. He saluted them gravely, and then\narising, washed his face and hands in a basin which Gascoyne held; then\nkneeled in prayer, the others standing silent at a little distance. As\nhe arose, Lord George came forward.\n\n\"The King and the company come presently to the Great Hall, Myles,\" said\nhe; \"it is needful for thee to make all the haste that thou art able.\"\n\nPerhaps never had Devlen Castle seen a more brilliant and goodly company\ngathered in the great hall than that which came to witness King Henry\ncreate Myles Falworth a knight bachelor.\n\nAt the upper end of the hall was a raised dais, upon which stood\na throne covered with crimson satin and embroidered with lions and\nflower-deluces; it was the King's seat. He and his personal attendants\nhad not yet come, but the rest of the company were gathered. The day\nbeing warm and sultry, the balcony was all aflutter with the feather\nfans of the ladies of the family and their attendants, who from this\nhigh place looked down upon the hall below. Up the centre of the hall\nwas laid a carpet of arras, and the passage was protected by wooden\nrailings. Upon the one side were tiers of seats for the castle\ngentlefolks and the guests. Upon the other stood the burghers from the\ntown, clad in sober dun and russet, and yeomanry in green and brown. The\nwhole of the great vaulted hall was full of the dull hum of many people\nwaiting, and a ceaseless restlessness stirred the crowded throng. But\nat last a whisper went around that the King was coming. A momentary hush\nfell, and through it was heard the noisy clatter of horses' feet coming\nnearer and nearer, and then stopping before the door. The sudden blare\nof trumpets broke through the hush; another pause, and then in through\nthe great door-way of the hall came the royal procession.\n\nFirst of all marched, in the order of their rank, and to the number of\na score or more, certain gentlemen, esquires and knights, chosen mostly\nfrom the King's attendants. Behind these came two pursuivants-at-arms\nin tabards, and following them a party of a dozen more bannerets\nand barons. Behind these again, a little space intervening, came two\nheralds, also in tabards, a group of the greater nobles attendant\nupon the King following in the order of their rank. Next came the\nKing-at-arms and, at a little distance and walking with sober slowness,\nthe King himself, with the Earl and the Count directly attendant upon\nhim--the one marching upon the right hand and the other upon the left.\nA breathless silence filled the whole space as the royal procession\nadvanced slowly up the hall. Through the stillness could be heard the\nmuffled sound of the footsteps on the carpet, the dry rustling of\nsilk and satin garments, and the clear clink and jingle of chains and\njewelled ornaments, but not the sound of a single voice.\n\nAfter the moment or two of bustle and confusion of the King taking his\nplace had passed, another little space of expectant silence fell. At\nlast there suddenly came the noise of acclamation of those who stood\nwithout the door--cheering and the clapping of hands--sounds heralding\nthe immediate advent of Myles and his attendants. The next moment the\nlittle party entered the hall.\n\nFirst of all, Gascoyne, bearing Myles's sword in both hands, the hilt\nresting against his breast, the point elevated at an angle of forty-five\ndegrees. It was sheathed in a crimson scabbard, and the belt of Spanish\nleather studded with silver bosses was wound crosswise around it. From\nthe hilt of the sword dangled the gilt spurs of his coming knighthood.\nAt a little distance behind his squire followed Myles, the centre of\nall observation. He was clad in a novitiate dress, arranged under Lord\nGeorge's personal supervision. It had been made somewhat differently\nfrom the fashion usual at such times, and was intended to indicate in a\nmanner the candidate's extreme youthfulness and virginity in arms. The\nouter garment was a tabard robe of white wool, embroidered at the hem\nwith fine lines of silver, and gathered loosely at the waist with a belt\nof lavender leather stitched with thread of silver. Beneath he was clad\nin armor (a present from the Earl), new and polished till it shone with\ndazzling brightness, the breastplate covered with a juppon of white\nsatin, embroidered with silver. Behind Myles, and upon either hand, came\nhis squires of honor, sponsors, and friends--a little company of\nsome half-dozen in all. As they advanced slowly up the great, dim,\nhigh-vaulted room, the whole multitude broke forth into a humming buzz\nof applause. Then a sudden clapping of hands began near the door-way,\nran down through the length of the room, and was taken up by all with\nnoisy clatter.\n\n\"Saw I never youth so comely,\" whispered one of the Lady Anne's\nattendant gentlewomen. \"Sure he looketh as Sir Galahad looked when he\ncame first to King Arthur's court.\"\n\nMyles knew that he was very pale; he felt rather than saw the restless\ncrowd of faces upon either side, for his eyes were fixed directly before\nhim, upon the dais whereon sat the King, with the Earl of Mackworth\nstanding at his right hand, the Comte de Vermoise upon the left, and the\nothers ranged around and behind the throne. It was with the same tense\nfeeling of dreamy unreality that Myles walked slowly up the length of\nthe hall, measuring his steps by those of Gascoyne. Suddenly he\nfelt Lord George Beaumont touch him lightly upon the arm, and almost\ninstinctively he stopped short--he was standing just before the covered\nsteps of the throne.\n\nHe saw Gascoyne mount to the third step, stop short, kneel, and offer\nthe sword and the spurs he carried to the King, who took the weapon\nand laid it across his knees. Then the squire bowed low, and walking\nbackward withdrew to one side, leaving Myles standing alone facing the\nthrone. The King unlocked the spur chains from the sword-hilt, and\nthen, holding the gilt spurs in his hand for a moment, he looked Myles\nstraight in the eyes and smiled. Then he turned, and gave one of the\nspurs to the Earl of Mackworth.\n\nThe Earl took it with a low bow, turned, and came slowly down the steps\nto where Myles stood. Kneeling upon one knee, and placing Myles's foot\nupon the other, Lord Mackworth set the spur in its place and latched the\nchain over the instep. He drew the sign of the cross upon Myles's bended\nknee, set the foot back upon the ground, rose with slow dignity, and\nbowing to the King, drew a little to one side.\n\nAs soon as the Earl had fulfilled his office the King gave the second\nspur to the Comte de Vermoise, who set it to Myles's other foot with the\nsame ceremony that the Earl had observed, withdrawing as he had done to\none side.\n\nAn instant pause of motionless silence followed, and then the King\nslowly arose, and began deliberately to unwind the belt from around the\nscabbard of the sword he held. As soon as he stood, the Earl and the\nCount advanced, and taking Myles by either hand, led him forward and up\nthe steps of the dais to the platform above. As they drew a little to\none side, the King stooped and buckled the sword-belt around Myles's\nwaist, then, rising again, lifted his hand and struck him upon the\nshoulder, crying, in a loud voice.\n\n\"Be thou a good knight!\"\n\nInstantly a loud sound of applause and the clapping of hands filled the\nwhole hall, in the midst of which the King laid both hands upon Myles's\nshoulders and kissed him upon the right cheek. So the ceremony ended;\nMyles was no longer Myles Falworth, but Sir Myles Falworth, Knight by\nOrder of the Bath and by grace of the King!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\nIt was the custom to conclude the ceremonies of the bestowal of\nknighthood by a grand feast given in honor of the newly-created knight.\nBut in Myles's instance the feast was dispensed with. The Earl of\nMackworth had planned that Myles might be created a Knight of the Bath\nwith all possible pomp and ceremony; that his personality might be\nmost favorably impressed upon the King; that he might be so honorably\nknighted as to make him the peer of any who wore spurs in all England;\nand, finally, that he might celebrate his new honors by jousting with\nsome knight of high fame and approved valor. All these desiderata chance\nhad fulfilled in the visit of the King to Devlen.\n\nAs the Earl had said to Myles, he would rather have waited a little\nwhile longer until the lad was riper in years and experience, but the\nopportunity was not to be lost. Young as he was, Myles must take\nhis chances against the years and grim experience of the Sieur de la\nMontaigne. But it was also a part of the Earl's purpose that the King\nand Myles should not be brought too intimately together just at that\ntime. Though every particular of circumstance should be fulfilled in the\nceremony, it would have been ruination to the Earl's plans to have the\nknowledge come prematurely to the King that Myles was the son of\nthe attainted Lord Falworth. The Earl knew that Myles was a shrewd,\ncoolheaded lad; but the King had already hinted that the name was\nfamiliar to his ears, and a single hasty answer or unguarded speech upon\nthe young knight's part might awaken him to a full knowledge. Such a\nmishap was, of all things, to be avoided just then, for, thanks to the\nmachinations of that enemy of his father of whom Myles had heard so\nmuch, and was soon to hear more, the King had always retained and still\nheld a bitter and rancorous enmity against the unfortunate nobleman.\n\nIt was no very difficult matter for the Earl to divert the King's\nattention from the matter of the feast. His Majesty was very intent\njust then upon supplying a quota of troops to the Dauphin, and the chief\nobject of his visit to Devlen was to open negotiations with the Earl\nlooking to that end. He was interested--much interested in Myles and in\nthe coming jousting in which the young warrior was to prove himself, but\nhe was interested in it by way of a relaxation from the other and more\nengrossing matter. So, though he made some passing and half preoccupied\ninquiry about the feast he was easily satisfied with the Earl's reasons\nfor not holding it: which were that he had arranged a consultation for\nthat morning in regard to the troops for the Dauphin, to which meeting\nhe had summoned a number of his own more important dependent nobles,\nthat the King himself needed repose and the hour or so of rest that\nhis barber-surgeon had ordered him to take after his mid-day meal; that\nFather Thomas had laid upon Myles a petty penance--that for the first\nthree days of his knighthood he should eat his meals without meat and\nin his own apartment--and various other reasons equally good and\nsufficient. So the King was satisfied, and the feast was dispensed with.\n\nThe next morning had been set for the jousting, and all that day the\nworkmen were busy erecting the lists in the great quadrangle upon which,\nas was said before, looked the main buildings of the castle. The windows\nof Myles's apartment opened directly upon the bustling scene--the\ncarpenters hammering and sawing, the upholsterers snipping, cutting,\nand tacking. Myles and Gascoyne stood gazing out from the open casement,\nwith their arms lying across one another's shoulders in the old boyhood\nfashion, and Myles felt his heart shrink with a sudden tight pang as\nthe realization came sharply and vividly upon him that all these\npreparations were being made for him, and that the next day he should,\nwith almost the certainty of death, meet either glory or failure under\nthe eyes not only of all the greater and lesser castle folk, but of the\nKing himself and noble strangers critically used to deeds of chivalry\nand prowess. Perhaps he had never fully realized the magnitude of the\nreality before. In that tight pang at his heart he drew a deep breath,\nalmost a sigh. Gascoyne turned his head abruptly, and looked at his\nfriend, but he did not ask the cause of the sigh. No doubt the same\nthoughts that were in Myles's mind were in his also.\n\n\nIt was towards the latter part of the afternoon that a message came from\nthe Earl, bidding Myles attend him in his private closet. After Myles\nhad bowed and kissed his lordship's hand, the Earl motioned him to\ntake a seat, telling him that he had some final words to say that might\noccupy a considerable time. He talked to the young man for about half\nan hour in his quiet, measured voice, only now and then showing a little\nagitation by rising and walking up and down the room for a turn or two.\nVery many things were disclosed in that talk that had caused Myles\nlong hours of brooding thought, for the Earl spoke freely, and without\nconcealment to him concerning his father and the fortunes of the house\nof Falworth.\n\nMyles had surmised many things, but it was not until then that he knew\nfor a certainty who was his father's malignant and powerful enemy--that\nit was the great Earl of Alban, the rival and bitter enemy of the Earl\nof Mackworth. It was not until then that he knew that the present Earl\nof Alban was the Lord Brookhurst, who had killed Sir John Dale in\nthe anteroom at Falworth Castle that morning so long ago in his early\nchildhood. It was not until then that he knew all the circumstances of\nhis father's blindness; that he had been overthrown in the melee at the\ngreat tournament at York, and that that same Lord Brookhurst had ridden\nhis iron-shod war-horse twice over his enemy's prostrate body before his\nsquire could draw him from the press, and had then and there given him\nthe wound from which he afterwards went blind. The Earl swore to Myles\nthat Lord Brookhurst had done what he did wilfully, and had afterwards\nboasted of it. Then, with some hesitation, he told Myles the reason\nof Lord Brookhurst's enmity, and that it had arisen on account of Lady\nFalworth, whom he had one time sought in marriage, and that he had sworn\nvengeance against the man who had won her.\n\nPiece by piece the Earl of Mackworth recounted every circumstance and\ndetail of the revenge that the blind man's enemy had afterwards\nwreaked upon him. He told Myles how, when his father was attainted\nof high-treason, and his estates forfeited to the crown, the King had\ngranted the barony of Easterbridge to the then newly-created Earl of\nAlban in spite of all the efforts of Lord Falworth's friends to the\ncontrary; that when he himself had come out from an audience with the\nKing, with others of his father's friends, the Earl of Alban had boasted\nin the anteroom, in a loud voice, evidently intended for them all to\nhear, that now that he had Falworth's fat lands, he would never rest\ntill he had hunted the blind man out from his hiding, and brought his\nhead to the block.\n\n\"Ever since then,\" said the Earl of Mackworth \"he hath been striving by\nevery means to discover thy father's place of concealment. Some time,\nhaply, he may find it, and then--\"\n\nMyles had felt for a long time that he was being moulded and shaped, and\nthat the Earl of Mackworth's was the hand that was making him what he\nwas growing to be; but he had never realized how great were the things\nexpected of him should he pass the first great test, and show himself\nwhat his friends hoped to see him. Now he knew that all were looking\nupon him to act, sometime, as his father's champion, and when that time\nshould come, to challenge the Earl of Alban to the ordeal of single\ncombat, to purge his father's name of treason, to restore him to his\nrank, and to set the house of Falworth where it stood before misfortune\nfell upon it.\n\nBut it was not alone concerning his and his father's affairs that the\nEarl of Mackworth talked to Myles. He told him that the Earl of Alban\nwas the Earl of Mackworth's enemy also; that in his younger days he had\nhelped Lord Falworth, who was his kinsman, to win his wife, and that\nthen, Lord Brookhurst had sworn to compass his ruin as he had sworn\nto compass the ruin of his friend. He told Myles how, now that Lord\nBrookhurst was grown to be Earl of Alban, and great and powerful, he\nwas forever plotting against him, and showed Myles how, if Lord Falworth\nwere discovered and arrested for treason, he also would be likely to\nsuffer for aiding and abetting him. Then it dawned upon Myles that the\nEarl looked to him to champion the house of Beaumont as well as that of\nFalworth.\n\n\"Mayhap,\" said the Earl, \"thou didst think that it was all for the\npleasant sport of the matter that I have taken upon me this toil and\nendeavor to have thee knighted with honor that thou mightst fight the\nDauphiny knight. Nay, nay, Myles Falworth, I have not labored so\nhard for such a small matter as that. I have had the King, unknown to\nhimself, so knight thee that thou mayst be the peer of Alban himself,\nand now I would have thee to hold thine own with the Sieur de la\nMontaigne, to try whether thou be'st Alban's match, and to approve\nthyself worthy of the honor of thy knighthood. I am sorry, ne'theless,\"\nhe added, after a moment's pause, \"that this could not have been put off\nfor a while longer, for my plans for bringing thee to battle with that\nvile Alban are not yet ripe. But such a chance of the King coming hither\nhaps not often. And then I am glad of this much--that a good occasion\noffers to get thee presently away from England. I would have thee out\nof the King's sight so soon as may be after this jousting. He taketh\na liking to thee, and I fear me lest he should inquire more nearly\nconcerning thee and so all be discovered and spoiled. My brother George\ngoeth upon the first of next month to France to take service with the\nDauphin, having under his command a company of tenscore men--knights and\narchers; thou shalt go with him, and there stay till I send for thee to\nreturn.\"\n\nWith this, the protracted interview concluded, the Earl charging Myles\nto say nothing further about the French expedition for the present--even\nto his friend--for it was as yet a matter of secrecy, known only to the\nKing and a few nobles closely concerned in the venture.\n\nThen Myles arose to take his leave. He asked and obtained permission for\nGascoyne to accompany him to France. Then he paused for a moment or two,\nfor it was strongly upon him to speak of a matter that had been lying\nin his mind all day--a matter that he had dreamed of much with open eyes\nduring the long vigil of the night before.\n\nThe Earl looked up inquiringly. \"What is it thou wouldst ask?\" said he.\n\nMyles's heart was beating quickly within him at the thought of his own\nboldness, and as he spoke his cheeks burned like fire. \"Sir,\" said he,\nmustering his courage at last, \"haply thou hast forgot it, but I have\nnot; ne'theless, a long time since when I spoke of serving the--the Lady\nAlice as her true knight, thou didst wisely laugh at my words, and bade\nme wait first till I had earned my spurs. But now, sir, I have gotten\nmy spurs, and--and do now crave thy gracious leave that I may serve that\nlady as her true knight.\"\n\nA space of dead silence fell, in which Myles's heart beat tumultuously\nwithin him.\n\n\"I know not what thou meanest,\" said the Earl at last, in a somewhat\nconstrained voice. \"How wouldst thou serve her? What wouldst thou have?\"\n\n\"I would have only a little matter just now,\" answered Myles. \"I would\nbut crave of her a favor for to wear in the morrow's battle, so that she\nmay know that I hold her for my own true lady, and that I may have the\ncourage to fight more boldly, having that favor to defend.\"\n\nThe Earl sat looking at him for a while in brooding silence, stroking\nhis beard the while. Suddenly his brow cleared. \"So be it,\" said he.\n\"I grant thee my leave to ask the Lady Alice for a favor, and if she\nis pleased to give it to thee, I shall not say thee nay. But I set this\nupon thee as a provision: that thou shalt not see her without the Lady\nAnne be present. Thus it was, as I remember, thou saw her first, and\nwith it thou must now be satisfied. Go thou to the Long Gallery, and\nthither they will come anon if naught hinder them.\"\n\nMyles waited in the Long Gallery perhaps some fifteen or twenty minutes.\nNo one was there but himself. It was a part of the castle connecting the\nEarl's and the Countess's apartments, and was used but little. During\nthat time he stood looking absently out of the open casement into the\nstony court-yard beyond, trying to put into words that which he had\nto say; wondering, with anxiety, how soon the young ladies would come;\nwondering whether they would come at all. At last the door at the\nfarther end of the gallery opened, and turning sharply at the sound, he\nsaw the two young ladies enter, Lady Alice leaning upon Lady Anne's arm.\nIt was the first time that he had seen them since the ceremony of the\nmorning, and as he advanced to meet them, the Lady Anne came frankly\nforward, and gave him her hand, which Myles raised to his lips.\n\n\"I give thee joy of thy knighthood, Sir Myles,\" said she, \"and do\nbelieve, in good sooth, that if any one deserveth such an honor, thou\nart he.\"\n\nAt first little Lady Alice hung back behind her cousin, saying nothing\nuntil the Lady Anne, turning suddenly, said: \"Come, coz, has thou naught\nto say to our new-made knight? Canst thou not also wish him joy of his\nknighthood?\"\n\nLady Alice hesitated a minute, then gave Myles a timid hand, which he,\nwith a strange mixture of joy and confusion, took as timidly as it was\noffered. He raised the hand, and set it lightly and for an instant\nto his lips, as he had done with the Lady Anne's hand, but with very\ndifferent emotions.\n\n\"I give you joy of your knighthood, sir,\" said Lady Alice, in a voice so\nlow that Myles could hardly hear it.\n\nBoth flushed red, and as he raised his head again, Myles saw that the\nLady Anne had withdrawn to one side. Then he knew that it was to give\nhim the opportunity to proffer his request.\n\nA little space of silence followed, the while he strove to key his\ncourage to the saying of that which lay at his mind. \"Lady,\" said he at\nlast, and then again--\"Lady, I--have a favor for to ask thee.\"\n\n\"What is it thou wouldst have, Sir Myles?\" she murmured, in reply.\n\n\"Lady,\" said he, \"ever sin I first saw thee I have thought that if I\nmight choose of all the world, thou only wouldst I choose for--for\nmy true lady, to serve as a right knight should.\" Here he stopped,\nfrightened at his own boldness. Lady Alice stood quite still, with her\nface turned away. \"Thou--thou art not angered at what I say?\" he said.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I have longed and longed for the time,\" said he, \"to ask a boon of thee,\nand now hath that time come. Lady, to-morrow I go to meet a right good\nknight, and one skilled in arms and in jousting, as thou dost know. Yea,\nhe is famous in arms, and I be nobody. Ne'theless, I fight for the honor\nof England and Mackworth--and--and for thy sake. I--Thou art not angered\nat what I say?\"\n\nAgain the Lady Alice shook her head.\n\n\"I would that thou--I would that thou would give me some favor for to\nwear--thy veil or thy necklace.\"\n\nHe waited anxiously for a little while, but Lady Alice did not answer\nimmediately.\n\n\"I fear me,\" said Myles, presently, \"that I have in sooth offended thee\nin asking this thing. I know that it is a parlous bold matter for one so\nraw in chivalry and in courtliness as I am, and one so poor in rank, to\nask thee for thy favor. An I ha' offended, I prithee let it be as though\nI had not asked it.\"\n\nPerhaps it was the young man's timidity that brought a sudden courage to\nLady Alice; perhaps it was the graciousness of her gentle breeding that\nurged her to relieve Myles's somewhat awkward humility, perhaps it was\nsomething more than either that lent her bravery to speak, even knowing\nthat the Lady Anne heard all. She turned quickly to him: \"Nay, Sir\nMyles,\" she said, \"I am foolish, and do wrong thee by my foolishness\nand silence, for, truly, I am proud to have thee wear my favor.\" She\nunclasped, as she spoke, the thin gold chain from about her neck. \"I\ngive thee this chain,\" said she, \"and it will bring me joy to have it\nhonored by thy true knightliness, and, giving it, I do wish thee all\nsuccess.\" Then she bowed her head, and, turning, left him holding the\nnecklace in his hand.\n\nHer cousin left the window to meet her, bowing her head with a smile\nto Myles as she took her cousin's arm again and led her away. He stood\nlooking after them as they left the room, and when they were gone, he\nraised the necklace to his lips with a heart beating tumultuously with a\ntriumphant joy it had never felt before.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\nAnd now, at last, had come the day of days for Myles Falworth; the day\nwhen he was to put to the test all that he had acquired in the three\nyears of his training, the day that was to disclose what promise of\nfuture greatness there was in his strong young body. And it was a noble\nday; one of those of late September, when the air seems sweeter and\nfresher than at other times; the sun bright and as yellow as gold, the\nwind lusty and strong, before which the great white clouds go sailing\nmajestically across the bright blueness of the sky above, while their\ndusky shadows skim across the brown face of the rusty earth beneath.\n\nAs was said before, the lists had been set up in the great quadrangle\nof the castle, than which, level and smooth as a floor, no more fitting\nplace could be chosen. The course was of the usual size--sixty paces\nlong--and separated along its whole length by a barrier about five feet\nhigh. Upon the west side of the course and about twenty paces distant\nfrom it, a scaffolding had been built facing towards the east so as to\navoid the glare of the afternoon sun. In the centre was a raised dais,\nhung round with cloth of blue embroidered with lions rampant. Upon the\ndais stood a cushioned throne for the King, and upon the steps below,\nranged in the order of their dignity, were seats for the Earl, his\nguests, the family, the ladies, knights, and gentlemen of the castle.\nIn front, the scaffolding was covered with the gayest tapestries and\nbrightest-colored hangings that the castle could afford. And above,\nparti-colored pennants and streamers, surmounted by the royal ensign of\nEngland, waved and fluttered in the brisk wind.\n\nAt either end of the lists stood the pavilions of the knights. That of\nMyles was at the southern extremity and was hung, by the Earl's desire,\nwith cloth of the Beaumont colors (black and yellow), while a wooden\nshield bearing three goshawks spread (the crest of the house) was nailed\nto the roof, and a long streamer of black and yellow trailed out in the\nwind from the staff above. Myles, partly armed, stood at the door-way of\nthe pavilion, watching the folk gathering at the scaffolding. The ladies\nof the house were already seated, and the ushers were bustling hither\nand thither, assigning the others their places. A considerable crowd\nof common folk and burghers from the town had already gathered at\nthe barriers opposite, and as he looked at the restless and growing\nmultitude he felt his heart beat quickly and his flesh grow cold with a\nnervous trepidation--just such as the lad of to-day feels when he sees\nthe auditorium filling with friends and strangers who are to listen\nby-and-by to the reading of his prize poem.\n\nSuddenly there came a loud blast of trumpets. A great gate at the\nfarther extremity of the lists was thrown open, and the King appeared,\nriding upon a white horse, preceded by the King-at-arms and the heralds,\nattended by the Earl and the Comte de Vermoise, and followed by a crowd\nof attendants. Just then Gascoyne, who, with Wilkes, was busied lacing\nsome of the armor plates with new thongs, called Myles, and he turned\nand entered the pavilion.\n\nAs the two squires were adjusting these last pieces, strapping them in\nplace and tying the thongs, Lord George and Sir James Lee entered\nthe pavilion. Lord George took the young man by the hand, and with a\npleasant smile wished him success in the coming encounter.\n\nSir James seemed anxious and disturbed. He said nothing, and after\nGascoyne had placed the open bascinet that supports the tilting helm\nin its place, he came forward and examined the armor piece by piece,\ncarefully and critically, testing the various straps and leather points\nand thongs to make sure of their strength.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Gascoyne, who stood by watching him anxiously, \"I do trust\nthat I have done all meetly and well.\"\n\n\"I see nothing amiss, sirrah,\" said the old knight, half grudgingly. \"So\nfar as I may know, he is ready to mount.\"\n\nJust then a messenger entered, saying that the King was seated, and Lord\nGeorge bade Myles make haste to meet the challenger.\n\n\"Francis,\" said Myles, \"prithee give me my pouch yonder.\"\n\nGascoyne handed him the velvet bag, and he opened it, and took out the\nnecklace that the Lady Alice had given him the day before.\n\n\"Tie me this around my arm,\" said he. He looked down, keeping his eyes\nstudiously fixed on Gascoyne's fingers, as they twined the thin golden\nchain around the iron plates of his right arm, knowing that Lord\nGeorge's eyes were upon him, and blushing fiery red at the knowledge.\n\nSir James was at that moment examining the great tilting helm, and Lord\nGeorge watched him, smiling amusedly. \"And hast thou then already chosen\nthee a lady?\" he said, presently.\n\n\"Aye, my Lord,\" answered Myles, simply.\n\n\"Marry, I trust we be so honored that she is one of our castle folk,\"\nsaid the Earl's brother.\n\nFor a moment Myles did not reply; then he looked up. \"My Lord,\" said he,\n\"the favor was given to me by the Lady Alice.\"\n\nLord George looked grave for the moment; then he laughed. \"Marry, thou\nart a bold archer to shoot for such high game.\"\n\nMyles did not answer, and at that moment two grooms led his horse up to\nthe door of the pavilion. Gascoyne and Wilkes helped him to his saddle,\nand then, Gascoyne holding his horse by the bridle-rein, he rode slowly\nacross the lists to the little open space in front of the scaffolding\nand the King's seat just as the Sieur de la Montaigne approached from\nthe opposite direction.\n\nAs soon as the two knights champion had reached each his appointed\nstation in front of the scaffolding, the Marshal bade the speaker read\nthe challenge, which, unrolling the parchment, he began to do in a loud,\nclear voice, so that all might hear. It was a quaint document, wrapped\nup in the tangled heraldic verbiage of the time.\n\nThe pith of the matter was that the Sieur Brian Philip Francis de la\nMontaigne proclaimed before all men the greater chivalry and skill at\narms of the knights of France and of Dauphiny, and likewise the greater\nfairness of the ladies of France and Dauphiny, and would there defend\nthose sayings with his body without fear or attaint as to the truth of\nthe same. As soon as the speaker had ended, the Marshal bade him call\nthe defendant of the other side.\n\nThen Myles spoke his part, with a voice trembling somewhat with the\nexcitement of the moment, but loudly and clearly enough: \"I, Myles\nEdward Falworth, knight, so created by the hand and by the grace of\nhis Majesty King Henry IV of England, do take upon me the gage of this\nbattle, and will defend with my body the chivalry of the knights of\nEngland and the fairness of the ladies thereof!\"\n\nThen, after the speaker ended his proclamation and had retired to his\nplace, the ceremony of claiming and redeeming the helmet, to which\nall young knights were subjected upon first entering the lists, was\nperformed.\n\nOne of the heralds cried in a loud voice, \"I, Gilles Hamerton, herald to\nthe most noble Clarencieux King-at-arms, do claim the helm of Sir Myles\nEdward Falworth by this reason, that he hath never yet entered joust or\ntourney.\"\n\nTo which Myles answered, \"I do acknowledge the right of that claim, and\nherewith proffer thee in ransom for the same this purse of one hundred\nmarks in gold.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Gascoyne stepped forward and delivered the purse, with the\nmoney, to the Herald. It was a more than usually considerable ransom,\nand had been made up by the Earl and Lord George that morning.\n\n\"Right nobly hast thou redeemed thy helm,\" said the Herald, \"and\nhereafter be thou free to enter any jousting whatsoever, and in whatever\nplace.\"\n\nSo, all being ended, both knights bowed to the King, and then, escorted\neach by his squire, returned to his pavilion, saluted by the spectators\nwith a loud clapping of hands.\n\nSir James Lee met Myles in front of his tent. Coming up to the side of\nthe horse, the old man laid his hand upon the saddle, looking up into\nthe young man's face.\n\n\"Thou wilt not fail in this venture and bring shame upon me?\" said he.\n\n\"Nay, my dear master,\" said Myles; \"I will do my best.\"\n\n\"I doubt it not,\" said the old man; \"and I believe me thou wilt come off\nright well. From what he did say this morning, methinks the Sieur de la\nMontaigne meaneth only to break three lances with thee, and will content\nhimself therewith, without seeking to unhorse thee. Ne'theless, be thou\nbold and watchful, and if thou find that he endeavor to cast thee, do\nthy best to unhorse him. Remember also those things which I have told\nthee ten thousand times before: hold thy toes well down and grip the\nstirrup hard, more especially at the moment of meeting; bend thy body\nforward, and keep thine elbow close to thy side. Bear thy lance point\none foot above thine adversary's helm until within two lengths of\nmeeting, and strike thou in the very middle of his shield. So, Myles,\nthou mayst hold thine own, and come off with glory.\"\n\nAs he ended speaking he drew back, and Gascoyne, mounting upon a stool,\ncovered his friend's head and bascinet with the great jousting helm,\nmaking fast the leathern points that held it to the iron collar.\n\nAs he was tying the last thong a messenger came from the Herald, saying\nthat the challenger was ready, and then Myles knew the time had come,\nand reaching down and giving Sir James a grip of the hand, he drew on\nhis gauntlet, took the jousting lance that Wilkes handed him, and turned\nhis horse's head towards his end of the lists.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\nAs Myles took his place at the south end of the lists, he found the\nSieur de la Montaigne already at his station. Through the peep-hole in\nthe face of the huge helmet, a transverse slit known as the occularium,\nhe could see, like a strange narrow picture, the farther end of\nthe lists, the spectators upon either side moving and shifting with\nceaseless restlessness, and in the centre of all, his opponent, sitting\nwith spear point directed upward, erect, motionless as a statue of iron,\nthe sunlight gleaming and flashing upon his polished plates of steel,\nand the trappings of his horse swaying and fluttering in the rushing of\nthe fresh breeze.\n\nUpon that motionless figure his sight gradually centred with every\nfaculty of mind and soul. He knew the next moment the signal would be\ngiven that was to bring him either glory or shame from that iron statue.\nHe ground his teeth together with stern resolve to do his best in the\ncoming encounter, and murmured a brief prayer in the hallow darkness of\nhis huge helm. Then with a shake he settled himself more firmly in his\nsaddle, slowly raised his spear point until the shaft reached the exact\nangle, and there suffered it to rest motionless. There was a moment of\ndead, tense, breathless pause, then he rather felt than saw the Marshal\nraise his baton. He gathered himself together, and the next moment a\nbugle sounded loud and clear. In one blinding rush he drove his spurs\ninto the sides of his horse, and in instant answer felt the noble steed\nspring forward with a bound.\n\nThrough all the clashing of his armor reverberating in the hollow depths\nof his helmet, he saw the mail-clad figure from the other end of the\nlists rushing towards him, looming larger and larger as they came\ntogether. He gripped his saddle with his knees, clutched the stirrup\nwith the soles of his feet, and bent his body still more forward. In the\ninstant of meeting, with almost the blindness of instinct, he dropped\nthe point of his spear against the single red flower-de-luce in the\nmiddle of the on-coming shield. There was a thunderous crash that seemed\nto rack every joint, he heard the crackle of splintered wood, he felt\nthe momentary trembling recoil of the horse beneath him, and in the next\ninstant had passed by. As he checked the onward rush of his horse at the\nfar end of the course, he heard faintly in the dim hollow recess of the\nhelm the loud shout and the clapping of hands of those who looked on,\nand found himself gripping with nervous intensity the butt of a broken\nspear, his mouth clammy with excitement, and his heart thumping in his\nthroat.\n\nThen he realized that he had met his opponent, and had borne the meeting\nwell. As he turned his horse's head towards his own end of the lists, he\nsaw the other trotting slowly back towards his station, also holding a\nbroken spear shaft in his hand.\n\nAs he passed the iron figure a voice issued from the helmet, \"Well done,\nSir Myles, nobly done!\" and his heart bounded in answer to the words of\npraise. When he had reached his own end of the lists, he flung away his\nbroken spear, and Gascoyne came forward with another.\n\n\"Oh, Myles!\" he said, with sob in his voice, \"it was nobly done. Never\ndid I see a better ridden course in all my life. I did not believe that\nthou couldst do half so well. Oh, Myles, prithee knock him out of his\nsaddle an thou lovest me!\"\n\nMyles, in his high-keyed nervousness, could not forbear a short\nhysterical laugh at his friend's warmth of enthusiasm. He took the fresh\nlance in his hand, and then, seeing that his opponent was walking his\nhorse slowly up and down at his end of the lists, did the same during\nthe little time of rest before the next encounter.\n\nWhen, in answer to the command of the Marshal, he took his place a\nsecond time, he found himself calmer and more collected than before, but\nevery faculty no less intensely fixed than it had been at first. Once\nmore the Marshal raised his baton, once more the horn sounded, and once\nmore the two rushed together with the same thunderous crash, the same\nsplinter of broken spears, the same momentary trembling recoil of\nthe horse, and the same onward rush past one another. Once more the\nspectators applauded and shouted as the two knights turned their horses\nand rode back towards their station.\n\nThis time as they met midway the Sieur de la Montaigne reined in his\nhorse. \"Sir Myles,\" said his muffled voice, \"I swear to thee, by my\nfaith, I had not thought to meet in thee such an opponent as thou dost\nprove thyself to be. I had thought to find in thee a raw boy, but find\ninstead a Paladin. Hitherto I have given thee grace as I would\ngive grace to any mere lad, and thought of nothing but to give thee\nopportunity to break thy lance. Now I shall do my endeavor to unhorse\nthee as I would an acknowledged peer in arms. Nevertheless, on account\nof thy youth, I give thee this warning, so that thou mayst hold thyself\nin readiness.\"\n\n\"I give thee gramercy for thy courtesy, my Lord,\" answered Myles,\nspeaking in French; \"and I will strive to encounter thee as best I may,\nand pardon me if I seem forward in so saying, but were I in thy place,\nmy Lord, I would change me yon breast-piece and over-girth of my saddle;\nthey are sprung in the stitches.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Sieur de la Montaigne, laughing, \"breast-piece and\nover-girth have carried me through more tilts than one, and shall\nthrough this. An thou give me a blow so true as to burst breast-piece\nand over-girth, I will own myself fairly conquered by thee.\" So saying,\nhe saluted Myles with the butt of the spear he still held, and passed by\nto his end of the lists.\n\nMyles, with Gascoyne running beside him, rode across to his pavilion,\nand called to Edmund Wilkes to bring him a cup of spiced wine. After\nGascoyne had taken off his helmet, and as he sat wiping the perspiration\nfrom his face Sir James came up and took him by the hand.\n\n\"My dear boy,\" said he, gripping the hand he held, \"never could I hope\nto be so overjoyed in mine old age as I am this day. Thou dost bring\nhonor to me, for I tell thee truly thou dost ride like a knight seasoned\nin twenty tourneys.\"\n\n\"It doth give me tenfold courage to hear thee so say, dear master,\"\nanswered Myles. \"And truly,\" he added, \"I shall need all my courage\nthis bout, for the Sieur de la Montaigne telleth me that he will ride to\nunhorse me this time.\"\n\n\"Did he indeed so say?\" said Sir James. \"Then belike he meaneth to\nstrike at thy helm. Thy best chance is to strike also at his. Doth thy\nhand tremble?\"\n\n\"Not now,\" answered Myles.\n\n\"Then keep thy head cool and thine eye true. Set thy trust in God, and\nhaply thou wilt come out of this bout honorably in spite of the rawness\nof thy youth.\"\n\nJust then Edmund Wilkes presented the cup of wine to Myles, who drank it\noff at a draught, and thereupon Gascoyne replaced the helm and tied the\nthongs.\n\nThe charge that Sir James Lee had given to Myles to strike at his\nadversary's helm was a piece of advice he probably would not have given\nto so young a knight, excepting as a last resort. A blow perfectly\ndelivered upon the helm was of all others the most difficult for the\nrecipient to recover from, but then a blow upon the helm was not one\ntime in fifty perfectly given. The huge cylindrical tilting helm was so\nconstructed in front as to slope at an angle in all directions to one\npoint. That point was the centre of a cross formed by two iron bands\nwelded to the steel-face plates of the helm where it was weakened by the\nopening slit of the occularium, or peephole. In the very centre of\nthis cross was a little flattened surface where the bands were riveted\ntogether, and it was upon that minute point that the blow must be given\nto be perfect, and that stroke Myles determined to attempt.\n\nAs he took his station Edmund Wilkes came running across from the\npavilion with a lance that Sir James had chosen, and Myles, returning\nthe one that Gascoyne had just given him, took it in his hand. It was\nof seasoned oak, somewhat thicker than the other, a tough weapon, not\neasily to be broken even in such an encounter as he was like to have. He\nbalanced the weapon, and found that it fitted perfectly to his grasp.\nAs he raised the point to rest, his opponent took his station at the\nfarther extremity of the lists, and again there was a little space of\nbreathless pause. Myles was surprised at his own coolness; every nervous\ntremor was gone. Before, he had been conscious of the critical multitude\nlooking down upon him; now it was a conflict of man to man, and such a\nconflict had no terrors for his young heart of iron.\n\nThe spectators had somehow come to the knowledge that this was to be\na more serious encounter than the two which had preceded it, and a\nbreathless silence fell for the moment or two that the knights stood in\nplace.\n\nOnce more he breathed a short prayer, \"Holy Mary, guard me!\"\n\nThen again, for the third time, the Marshal raised his baton, and the\nhorn sounded, and for the third time Myles drove his spurs into his\nhorse's flanks. Again he saw the iron figure of his opponent rushing\nnearer, nearer, nearer. He centred, with a straining intensity, every\nfaculty of soul, mind, and body upon one point--the cross of the\noccularium, the mark he was to strike. He braced himself for the\ntremendous shock which he knew must meet him, and then in a flash\ndropped lance point straight and true. The next instant there was a\ndeafening stunning crash--a crash like the stroke of a thunder-bolt.\nThere was a dazzling blaze of blinding light, and a myriad sparks danced\nand flickered and sparkled before his eyes. He felt his horse stagger\nunder him with the recoil, and hardly knowing what he did, he drove\nhis spurs deep into its sides with a shout. At the same moment there\nresounded in his ears a crashing rattle and clatter, he knew not of\nwhat, and then, as his horse recovered and sprang forward, and as the\nstunning bewilderment passed, he found that his helmet had been\nstruck off. He heard a great shout arise from all, and thought, with a\nsickening, bitter disappointment, that it was because he had lost. At\nthe farther end of the course he turned his horse, and then his heart\ngave a leap and a bound as though it would burst, the blood leaped to\nhis cheeks tingling, and his bosom thrilled with an almost agonizing\npang of triumph, of wonder, of amazement.\n\nThere, in a tangle of his horse's harness and of embroidered trappings,\nthe Sieur de la Montaigne lay stretched upon the ground, with his saddle\nnear by, and his riderless horse was trotting aimlessly about at the\nfarther end of the lists.\n\nMyles saw the two squires of the fallen knight run across to where their\nmaster lay, he saw the ladies waving their kerchiefs and veils, and the\ncastle people swinging their hats and shouting in an ecstasy of delight.\nThen he rode slowly back to where the squires were now aiding the fallen\nknight to arise. The senior squire drew his dagger, cut the leather\npoints, and drew off the helm, disclosing the knight's face--a face\nwhite as death, and convulsed with rage, mortification, and bitter\nhumiliation.\n\n\"I was not rightly unhorsed!\" he cried, hoarsely and with livid lips,\nto the Marshal and his attendants, who had ridden up. \"I unhelmed him\nfairly enough, but my over-girth and breast-strap burst, and my saddle\nslipped. I was not unhorsed, I say, and I lay claim that I unhelmed\nhim.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Marshal calmly, and speaking in French, \"surely thou\nknowest that the loss of helmet does not decide an encounter. I need not\nremind thee, my Lord, that it was so awarded by John of Gaunt, Duke of\nLancaster, when in the jousting match between Reynand de Roye and John\nde Holland, the Sieur Reynand left every point of his helm loosened, so\nthat the helm was beaten off at each stroke. If he then was justified in\ndoing so of his own choice, and wilfully suffering to be unhelmed, how\nthen can this knight be accused of evil who suffered it by chance?\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the Sieur de la Montaigne, in the same hoarse,\nbreathless voice, \"I do affirm, and will make my affirmation good\nwith my body, that I fell only by the breaking of my girth. Who says\notherwise lies!\"\n\n\"It is the truth he speaketh,\" said Myles. \"I myself saw the stitches\nwere some little what burst, and warned him thereof before we ran this\ncourse.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Marshal to the Sieur de la Montaigne, \"how can you now\ncomplain of that thing which your own enemy advised you of and warned\nyou against? Was it not right knightly for him so to do?\"\n\nThe Sieur de la Montaigne stood quite still for a little while, leaning\non the shoulder of his chief squire, looking moodily upon the ground;\nthen, without making answer, he turned, and walked slowly away to his\npavilion, still leaning on his squire's shoulder, whilst the other\nattendant followed behind, bearing his shield and helmet.\n\nGascoyne had picked up Myles's fallen helmet as the Sieur de la\nMontaigne moved away, and Lord George and Sir James Lee came walking\nacross the lists to where Myles still sat. Then, the one taking his\nhorse by the bridle-rein, and the other walking beside the saddle, they\nled him before the raised dais where the King sat.\n\nEven the Comte de Vermoise, mortified and amazed as he must have been\nat the overthrow of his best knight, joined in the praise and\ncongratulation that poured upon the young conqueror. Myles, his heart\nswelling with a passion of triumphant delight, looked up and met the\ngaze of Lady Alice fixed intently upon him. A red spot of excitement\nstill burned in either cheek, and it flamed to a rosier red as he bowed\nhis head to her before turning away.\n\nGascoyne had just removed Myles's breastplate and gorget, when Sir James\nLee burst into the pavilion. All his grim coldness was gone, and he\nflung his arms around the young man's neck, hugging him heartily, and\nkissing him upon either cheek.\n\nEre he let him go, \"Mine own dear boy,\" he said, holding him off at\narm's-length, and winking his one keen eye rapidly, as though to wink\naway a dampness of which he was ashamed--\"mine own dear boy, I do tell\nthee truly this is as sweet to me as though thou wert mine own son;\nsweeter to me than when I first broke mine own lance in triumph, and\nfelt myself to be a right knight.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered Myles, \"what thou sayest doth rejoice my very heart.\nNe'theless, it is but just to say that both his breast-piece and\nover-girth were burst in the stitches before he ran his course, for so I\nsaw with mine own eyes.\"\n\n\"Burst in the stitches!\" snorted Sir James. \"Thinkest thou he did not\nknow in what condition was his horse's gearing? I tell thee he went down\nbecause thou didst strike fair and true, and he did not so strike thee.\nHad he been Guy of Warwick he had gone down all the same under such a\nstroke and in such case.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\nIt was not until more than three weeks after the King had left Devlen\nCastle that Lord George and his company of knights and archers were\nready for the expedition to France. Two weeks of that time Myles spent\nat Crosbey-Dale with his father and mother. It was the first time that\nhe had seen them since, four years ago, he had quitted the low, narrow,\nwhite-walled farmhouse for the castle of the great Earl of Mackworth. He\nhad never appreciated before how low and narrow and poor the farm-house\nwas. Now, with his eyes trained to the bigness of Devlen Castle,\nhe looked around him with wonder and pity at his father's humble\nsurroundings. He realized as he never else could have realized how great\nwas the fall in fortune that had cast the house of Falworth down from\nits rightful station to such a level as that upon which it now rested.\nAnd at the same time that he thus recognized how poor was their lot, how\ndependent upon the charity of others, he also recognized how generous\nwas the friendship of Prior Edward, who perilled his own safety so\ngreatly in affording the family of the attainted Lord an asylum in its\nbitter hour of need and peril.\n\nMyles paid many visits to the gentle old priest during those two weeks'\nvisit, and had many long and serious talks with him. One warm bright\nafternoon, as he and the old man walked together in the priory garden,\nafter a game or two of draughts, the young knight talked more freely and\nopenly of his plans, his hopes, his ambitions, than perhaps he had\never done. He told the old man all that the Earl had disclosed to him\nconcerning the fallen fortunes of his father's house, and of how all\nwho knew those circumstances looked to him to set the family in its old\nplace once more. Prior Edward added many things to those which Myles\nalready knew--things of which the Earl either did not know, or did not\nchoose to speak. He told the young man, among other matters, the reason\nof the bitter and lasting enmity that the King felt for the blind\nnobleman: that Lord Falworth had been one of King Richard's council in\ntimes past; that it was not a little owing to him that King Henry, when\nEarl of Derby, had been banished from England, and that though he\nwas then living in the retirement of private life, he bitterly and\nsteadfastly opposed King Richard's abdication. He told Myles that at the\ntime when Sir John Dale found shelter at Falworth Castle, vengeance was\nready to fall upon his father at any moment, and it needed only such a\npretext as that of sheltering so prominent a conspirator as Sir John to\ncomplete his ruin.\n\nMyles, as he listened intently, could not but confess in his own mind\nthat the King had many rational, perhaps just, grounds for grievance\nagainst such an ardent opponent as the blind Lord had shown himself to\nbe. \"But, sir,\" said he, after a little space of silence, when Prior\nEdward had ended, \"to hold enmity and to breed treason are very\ndifferent matters. Haply my father was Bolingbroke's enemy, but, sure,\nthou dost not believe he is justly and rightfully tainted with treason?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" answered the priest, \"how canst thou ask me such a thing? Did I\nbelieve thy father a traitor, thinkest thou I would thus tell his son\nthereof? Nay, Myles, I do know thy father well, and have known him for\nmany years, and this of him, that few men are so honorable in heart and\nsoul as he. But I have told thee all these things to show that the King\nis not without some reason to be thy father's unfriend. Neither, haply,\nis the Earl of Alban without cause of enmity against him. So thou, upon\nthy part, shouldst not feel bitter rancor against the King for what hath\nhapped to thy house, nor even against William Brookhurst--I mean the\nEarl of Alban--for, I tell thee, the worst of our enemies and the worst\nof men believe themselves always to have right and justice upon their\nside, even when they most wish evil to others.\"\n\nSo spoke the gentle old priest, who looked from his peaceful haven with\ndreamy eyes upon the sweat and tussle of the world's battle. Had he\ninstead been in the thick of the fight, it might have been harder for\nhim to believe that his enemies ever had right upon their side.\n\n\"But tell me this,\" said Myles, presently, \"dost thou, then, think that\nI do evil in seeking to do a battle of life or death with this wicked\nEarl of Alban, who hath so ruined my father in body and fortune?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Prior Edward, thoughtfully, \"I say not that thou doest evil.\nWar and bloodshed seem hard and cruel matters to me; but God hath given\nthat they be in the world, and may He forbid that such a poor worm as I\nshould say that they be all wrong and evil. Meseems even an evil thing\nis sometimes passing good when rightfully used.\"\n\nMyles did not fully understand what the old man meant, but this much he\ngathered, that his spiritual father did not think ill of his fighting\nthe Earl of Alban for his temporal father's sake.\n\nSo Myles went to France in Lord George's company, a soldier of fortune,\nas his Captain was. He was there for only six months, but those six\nmonths wrought a great change in his life. In the fierce factional\nbattles that raged around the walls of Paris; in the evil life which\nhe saw at the Burgundian court in Paris itself after the truce--a court\nbrilliant and wicked, witty and cruel--the wonderful liquor of youth had\nevaporated rapidly, and his character had crystallized as rapidly into\nthe hardness of manhood. The warfare, the blood, the evil pleasures\nwhich he had seen had been a fiery, crucible test to his soul, and I\nlove my hero that he should have come forth from it so well. He was no\nlonger the innocent Sir Galahad who had walked in pure white up the\nLong Hall to be knighted by the King, but his soul was of that grim,\nsterling, rugged sort that looked out calmly from his gray eyes upon the\nwickedness and debauchery around him, and loved it not.\n\nThen one day a courier came, bringing a packet. It was a letter from the\nEarl, bidding Myles return straightway to England and to Mackworth House\nupon the Strand, nigh to London, without delay, and Myles knew that his\ntime had come.\n\nIt was a bright day in April when he and Gascoyne rode clattering out\nthrough Temple Bar, leaving behind them quaint old London town, its\nblank stone wall, its crooked, dirty streets, its high-gabled wooden\nhouses, over which rose the sharp spire of St. Paul's, towering high\ninto the golden air. Before them stretched the straight, broad highway\nof the Strand, on one side the great houses and palaces of princely\npriests and powerful nobles; on the other the Covent Garden, (or the\nConvent Garden, as it was then called), and the rolling country, where\ngreat stone windmills swung their slow-moving arms in the damp, soft\nApril breeze, and away in the distance the Scottish Palace, the White\nHall, and Westminster.\n\nIt was the first time that Myles had seen famous London town. In that\ndim and distant time of his boyhood, six months before, he would\nhave been wild with delight and enthusiasm. Now he jogged along with\nGascoyne, gazing about him with calm interest at open shops and booths\nand tall, gabled houses; at the busy throng of merchants and craftsmen,\njostling and elbowing one another; at townsfolk--men and dames--picking\ntheir way along the muddy kennel of a sidewalk. He had seen so much of\nthe world that he had lost somewhat of interest in new things. So he\ndid not care to tarry, but rode, with a mind heavy with graver matters,\nthrough the streets and out through the Temple Bar direct for Mackworth\nHouse, near the Savoy Palace.\n\nIt was with a great deal of interest that Myles and his patron regarded\none another when they met for the first time after that half-year which\nthe young soldier had spent in France. To Myles it seemed somehow very\nstrange that his Lordship's familiar face and figure should look so\nexactly the same. To Lord Mackworth, perhaps, it seemed even more\nstrange that six short months should have wrought so great a change in\nthe young man. The rugged exposure in camp and field during the hard\nwinter that had passed had roughened the smooth bloom of his boyish\ncomplexion and bronzed his fair skin almost as much as a midsummer's sun\ncould have done. His beard and mustache had grown again, (now heavier\nand more mannish from having been shaved), and the white seam of a scar\nover the right temple gave, if not a stern, at least a determined look\nto the strong, square-jawed young face. So the two stood for a while\nregarding one another. Myles was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"My Lord,\" said he, \"thou didst send for me to come back to England;\nbehold, here am I.\"\n\n\"When didst thou land, Sir Myles?\" said the Earl.\n\n\"I and my squire landed at Dover upon Tuesday last,\" answered the young\nman.\n\nThe Earl of Mackworth stroked his beard softly. \"Thou art marvellous\nchanged,\" said he. \"I would not have thought it possible.\"\n\nMyles smiled somewhat grimly. \"I have seen such things, my Lord, in\nFrance and in Paris,\" said he, quietly, \"as, mayhap, may make a lad a\nman before his time.\"\n\n\"From which I gather,\" said the Earl, \"that many adventures have\nbefallen thee. Methought thou wouldst find troublesome times in the\nDauphin's camp, else I would not have sent thee to France.\"\n\nA little space of silence followed, during which the Earl sat musingly,\nhalf absently, regarding the tall, erect, powerful young figure standing\nbefore him, awaiting his pleasure in motionless, patient, almost dogged\nsilence. The strong, sinewy hands were clasped and rested upon the long\nheavy sword, around the scabbard of which the belt was loosely wrapped,\nand the plates of mail caught and reflected in flashing, broken pieces,\nthe bright sunlight from the window behind.\n\n\"Sir Myles,\" said the Earl, suddenly, breaking the silence at last,\n\"dost thou know why I sent for thee hither?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Myles, calmly, \"how can I else? Thou wouldst not have called\nme from Paris but for one thing. Methinks thou hast sent for me to fight\nthe Earl of Alban, and lo! I am here.\"\n\n\"Thou speakest very boldly,\" said the Earl. \"I do hope that thy deeds be\nas bold as thy words.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Myles, \"thou must ask other men. Methinks no one may justly\ncall me coward.\"\n\n\"By my troth!\" said the Earl, smiling, \"looking upon thee--limbs and\ngirth, bone and sinew--I would not like to be the he that would dare\naccuse thee of such a thing. As for thy surmise, I may tell thee plain\nthat thou art right, and that it was to fight the Earl of Alban I sent\nfor thee hither. The time is now nearly ripe, and I will straightway\nsend for thy father to come to London. Meantime it would not be safe\neither for thee or for me to keep thee in my service. I have spoken to\nhis Highness the Prince of Wales, who, with other of the Princes, is\nupon our side in this quarrel. He hath promised to take thee into his\nservice until the fitting time comes to bring thee and thine enemy\ntogether, and to-morrow I shall take thee to Scotland Yard, where his\nHighness is now lodging.\"\n\nAs the Earl ended his speech, Myles bowed, but did not speak. The Earl\nwaited for a little while, as though to give him the opportunity to\nanswer.\n\n\"Well, sirrah,\" said he at last, with a shade of impatience, \"hast thou\nnaught to say? Meseems thou takest all this with marvellous coolness.\"\n\n\"Have I then my Lord's permission to speak my mind?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said the Earl, \"say thy say.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Myles, \"I have thought and pondered this matter much while\nabroad, and would now ask thee a plain question in all honest an I ha'\nthy leave.\"\n\nThe Earl nodded his head.\n\n\"Sir, am I not right in believing that thou hast certain weighty\npurposes and aims of thine own to gain an I win this battle against the\nEarl of Alban?\"\n\n\"Has my brother George been telling thee aught to such a purpose?\" said\nthe Earl, after a moment or two of silence.\n\nMyles did not answer.\n\n\"No matter,\" added Lord Mackworth. \"I will not ask thee who told thee\nsuch a thing. As for thy question--well, sin thou ask it frankly, I will\nbe frank with thee. Yea, I have certain ends to gain in having the Earl\nof Alban overthrown.\"\n\nMyles bowed. \"Sir,\" said he, \"haply thine ends are as much beyond aught\nthat I can comprehend as though I were a little child; only this I know,\nthat they must be very great. Thou knowest well that in any case I would\nfight me this battle for my father's sake and for the honor of my house;\nnevertheless, in return for all that it will so greatly advantage thee,\nwilt thou not grant me a boon in return should I overcome mine enemy?\"\n\n\"What is thy boon, Sir Myles?\"\n\n\"That thou wilt grant me thy favor to seek the Lady Alice de Mowbray for\nmy wife.\"\n\nThe Earl of Mackworth started up from his seat. \"Sir Myles Falworth\"--he\nbegan, violently, and then stopped short, drawing his bushy eyebrows\ntogether into a frown stern, if not sinister.\n\nMyles withstood his look calmly and impassively, and presently the Earl\nturned on his heel, and strode to the open window. A long time passed in\nsilence while he stood there, gazing out of the window into the garden\nbeyond with his back to the young man.\n\nSuddenly he swung around again. \"Sir Myles,\" said he, \"the family of\nFalworth is as good as any in Derbyshire. Just now it is poor and fallen\nin estate, but if it is again placed in credit and honor, thou, who art\nthe son of the house, shalt have thy suit weighed with as much respect\nand consideration as though thou wert my peer in all things, Such is my\nanswer. Art thou satisfied?\"\n\n\"I could ask no more,\" answered Myles.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\nThat night Myles lodged at Mackworth House. The next morning, as soon\nas he had broken his fast, which he did in the privacy of his own\napartments, the Earl bade him and Gascoyne to make ready for the barge,\nwhich was then waiting at the river stairs to take them to Scotland\nYard.\n\nThe Earl himself accompanied them, and as the heavy snub-nosed boat,\nrowed by the six oarsmen in Mackworth livery, slid slowly and heavily\nup against the stream, the Earl, leaning back in his cushioned seat,\npointed out the various inns of the great priests or nobles; palatial\ntown residences standing mostly a little distance back from the water\nbehind terraced high-walled gardens and lawns. Yon was the Bishop of\nExeter's Close; yon was the Bishop of Bath's; that was York House; and\nthat Chester Inn. So passing by gardens and lawns and palaces, they came\nat last to Scotland Yard stairs, a broad flight of marble steps that led\nupward to a stone platform above, upon which opened the gate-way of the\ngarden beyond.\n\nThe Scotland Yard of Myles Falworth's day was one of the more\npretentious and commodious of the palaces of the Strand. It took its\nname from having been from ancient times the London inn which the\ntributary Kings of Scotland occupied when on their periodical visits of\nhomage to England. Now, during this time of Scotland's independence, the\nPrince of Wales had taken up his lodging in the old palace, and made it\nnoisy with the mad, boisterous mirth of his court.\n\nAs the watermen drew the barge close to the landing-place of the stairs,\nthe Earl stepped ashore, and followed by Myles and Gascoyne, ascended\nto the broad gate-way of the river wall of the garden. Three men-at-arms\nwho lounged upon a bench under the shade of the little pent roof of a\nguard-house beside the wall, arose and saluted as the well-known figure\nof the Earl mounted the steps. The Earl nodded a cool answer, and\npassing unchallenged through the gate, led the way up a pleached walk,\nbeyond which, as Myles could see, there stretched a little grassy lawn\nand a stone-paved terrace. As the Earl and the two young men approached\nthe end of the walk, they were met by the sound of voices and laughter,\nthe clinking of glasses and the rattle of dishes. Turning a corner,\nthey came suddenly upon a party of young gentlemen, who sat at a late\nbreakfast under the shade of a wide-spreading lime-tree. They had\nevidently just left the tilt-yard, for two of the guests--sturdy,\nthick-set young knights--yet wore a part of their tilting armor.\n\nBehind the merry scene stood the gray, hoary old palace, a steep flight\nof stone steps, and a long, open, stone-arched gallery, which evidently\nled to the kitchen beyond, for along it hurried serving-men, running up\nand down the tall flight of steps, and bearing trays and dishes and cups\nand flagons. It was a merry sight and a pleasant one. The day was warm\nand balmy, and the yellow sunlight fell in waving uncertain patches of\nlight, dappling the table-cloth, and twinkling and sparkling upon the\ndishes, cups, and flagons.\n\nAt the head of the table sat a young man some three or four years\nolder than Myles, dressed in a full suit of rich blue brocaded velvet,\nembroidered with gold-thread and trimmed with black fur. His face, which\nwas turned towards them as they mounted from the lawn to the little\nstone-flagged terrace, was frank and open; the cheeks smooth and fair;\nthe eyes dark and blue. He was tall and rather slight, and wore his\nthick yellow hair hanging to his shoulders, where it was cut square\nacross, after the manner of the times. Myles did not need to be told\nthat it was the Prince of Wales.\n\n\"Ho, Gaffer Fox!\" he cried, as soon as he caught sight of the Earl of\nMackworth, \"what wind blows thee hither among us wild mallard drakes?\nI warrant it is not for love of us, but only to fill thine own larder\nafter the manner of Sir Fox among the drakes. Whom hast thou with thee?\nSome gosling thou art about to pluck?\"\n\nA sudden hush fell upon the company, and all faces were turned towards\nthe visitors.\n\nThe Earl bowed with a soft smile. \"Your Highness,\" said he, smoothly,\n\"is pleased to be pleasant. Sir, I bring you the young knight of whom I\nspoke to you some time since--Sir Myles Falworth. You may be pleased to\nbring to mind that you so condescended as to promise to take him into\nyour train until the fitting time arrived for that certain matter of\nwhich we spoke.\"\n\n\"Sir Myles,\" said the Prince of Wales, with a frank, pleasant smile, \"I\nhave heard great reports of thy skill and prowess in France, both from\nMackworth and from others. It will pleasure me greatly to have thee in\nmy household; more especially,\" he added, \"as it will get thee, callow\nas thou art, out of my Lord Fox's clutches. Our faction cannot do\nwithout the Earl of Mackworth's cunning wits, Sir Myles; ne'theless I\nwould not like to put all my fate and fortune into his hands without\nbond. I hope that thou dost not rest thy fortunes entirely upon his aid\nand countenance.\"\n\nAll who were present felt the discomfort of the Prince's speech, It was\nevident that one of his mad, wild humors was upon him. In another case\nthe hare-brained young courtiers around might have taken their cue\nfrom him, but the Earl of Mackworth was no subject for their gibes\nand witticisms. A constrained silence fell, in which the Earl alone\nmaintained a perfect ease of manner.\n\nMyles bowed to hide his own embarrassment. \"Your Highness,\" said he,\nevasively, \"I rest my fortune, first of all, upon God, His strength and\njustice.\"\n\n\"Thou wilt find safer dependence there than upon the Lord of Mackworth,\"\nsaid the Prince, dryly. \"But come,\" he added, with a sudden change of\nvoice and manner, \"these be jests that border too closely upon bitter\nearnest for a merry breakfast. It is ill to idle with edged tools. Wilt\nthou not stay and break thy fast with us, my Lord?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, your Highness,\" said the Earl, bowing, and smiling the same\nsmooth smile his lips had worn from the first--such a smile as Myles\nhad never thought to have seen upon his haughty face; \"I crave your good\nleave to decline. I must return home presently, for even now, haply,\nyour uncle, his Grace of Winchester, is awaiting my coming upon the\nbusiness you wot of. Haply your Highness will find more joyance in a\nlusty young knight like Sir Myles than in an old fox like myself. So I\nleave him with you, in your good care.\"\n\nSuch was Myles's introduction to the wild young madcap Prince of Wales,\nafterwards the famous Henry V, the conqueror of France.\n\nFor a month or more thereafter he was a member of the princely\nhousehold, and, after a little while, a trusted and honored member.\nPerhaps it was the calm sturdy strength, the courage of the young\nknight, that first appealed to the Prince's royal heart; perhaps\nafterwards it was the more sterling qualities that underlaid that\ncourage that drew him to the young man; certain it was that in two weeks\nMyles was the acknowledged favorite. He made no protestation of virtue;\nhe always accompanied the Prince in those madcap ventures to London,\nwhere he beheld all manner of wild revelry; he never held himself aloof\nfrom his gay comrades, but he looked upon all their mad sports with the\nsame calm gaze that had carried him without taint through the courts of\nBurgundy and the Dauphin. The gay, roistering young lords and gentlemen\ndubbed him Saint Myles, and jested with him about hair-cloth shirts\nand flagellations, but witticism and jest alike failed to move Myles's\npatient virtue; he went his own gait in the habits of his life, and in\nso going knew as little as the others of the mad court that the Prince's\ngrowing liking for him was, perhaps, more than all else, on account of\nthat very temperance.\n\nThen, by-and-by, the Prince began to confide in him as he did in none of\nthe others. There was no great love betwixt the King and his son; it has\nhappened very often that the Kings of England have felt bitter jealousy\ntowards the heirs-apparent as they have grown in power, and such was the\ncase with the great King Henry IV. The Prince often spoke to Myles of\nthe clashing and jarring between himself and his father, and the thought\nbegan to come to Myles's mind by degrees that maybe the King's jealousy\naccounted not a little for the Prince's reckless intemperance.\n\nOnce, for instance, as the Prince leaned upon, his shoulder waiting,\nwhilst the attendants made ready the barge that was to carry them down\nthe river to the city, he said, abruptly: \"Myles, what thinkest thou of\nus all? Doth not thy honesty hold us in contempt?\"\n\n\"Nay, Highness,\" said Myles. \"How could I hold contempt?\"\n\n\"Marry,\" said the Prince, \"I myself hold contempt, and am not as honest\na man as thou. But, prithee, have patience with me, Myles. Some day,\nperhaps, I too will live a clean life. Now, an I live seriously, the\nKing will be more jealous of me than ever, and that is not a little.\nMaybe I live thus so that he may not know what I really am in soothly\nearnest.\"\n\nThe Prince also often talked to Myles concerning his own affairs; of\nthe battle he was to fight for his father's honor, of how the Earl of\nMackworth had plotted and planned to bring him face to face with the\nEarl of Alban. He spoke to Myles more than once of the many great\nchanges of state and party that hung upon the downfall of the enemy\nof the house of Falworth, and showed him how no hand but his own could\nstrike that enemy down; if he fell, it must be through the son of\nFalworth. Sometimes it seemed to Myles as though he and his blind father\nwere the centre of a great web of plot and intrigue, stretching far and\nwide, that included not only the greatest houses of England, but royalty\nand the political balance of the country as well, and even before the\ngreatness of it all he did not flinch.\n\nThen, at last, came the beginning of the time for action. It was in the\nearly part of May, and Myles had been a member of the Prince's household\nfor a little over a month. One morning he was ordered to attend the\nPrince in his privy cabinet, and, obeying the summons, he found the\nPrince, his younger brother, the Duke of Bedford, and his uncle, the\nBishop of Winchester, seated at a table, where they had just been\nrefreshing themselves with a flagon of wine and a plate of wafers.\n\n\"My poor Myles,\" said the Prince, smiling, as the young knight bowed to\nthe three, and then stood erect, as though on duty. \"It shames my heart,\nbrother--and thou, uncle--it shames my heart to be one privy to this\nthing which we are set upon to do. Here be we, the greatest Lords of\nEngland, making a cat's-paw of this lad--for he is only yet a boy--and\nof his blind father, for to achieve our ends against Alban's faction. It\nseemeth not over-honorable to my mind.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, your Highness,\" said Myles, blushing to the roots of his\nhair; \"but, an I may be so bold as to speak, I reck nothing of what your\naims may be; I only look to restoring my father's honor and the honor of\nour house.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said the Prince, smiling, \"that is the only matter that maketh\nme willing to lay my hands to this business. Dost thou know why I have\nsent for thee? It is because this day thou must challenge the Duke of\nAlban before the King. The Earl of Mackworth has laid all his plans and\nthe time is now ripe. Knowest that thy father is at Mackworth House?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Myles; \"I knew it not.\"\n\n\"He hath been there for nearly two days,\" said the Prince. \"Just now the\nEarl hath sent for us to come first to Mackworth House. Then to go\nto the palace, for he hath gained audience with the King, and hath so\narranged it that the Earl of Alban is to be there as well. We all go\nstraightway; so get thyself ready as soon as may be.\"\n\nPerhaps Myles's heart began beating more quickly within him at the\nnearness of that great happening which he had looked forward to for so\nlong. If it did, he made no sign of his emotion, but only asked, \"How\nmust I clothe myself, your Highness?\"\n\n\"Wear thy light armor,\" said the Prince, \"but no helmet, a juppon\nbearing the arms and colors that the Earl gave thee when thou wert\nknighted, and carry thy right-hand gauntlet under thy belt for thy\nchallenge. Now make haste, for time passes.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\nAdjoining the ancient palace of Westminster, where King Henry IV was\nthen holding his court, was a no less ancient stone building known as\nthe Painted Room. Upon the walls were depicted a series of battle scenes\nin long bands reaching around this room, one above another. Some of\nthese pictures had been painted as far back as the days of Henry III,\nothers had been added since his time. They chronicled the various wars\nof the King of England, and it was from them that the little hall took\nits name of the Painted Room.\n\nThis ancient wing, or offshoot, of the main buildings was more retired\nfrom the hurly-burly of outer life than other parts of the palace, and\nthither the sick King was very fond of retiring from the business of\nState, which ever rested more and more heavily upon his shoulders,\nsometimes to squander in quietness a spare hour or two; sometimes to\nidle over a favorite book; sometimes to play a game of chess with a\nfavorite courtier. The cold painted walls had been hung with tapestry,\nand its floor had been spread with arras carpet. These and the cushioned\ncouches and chairs that stood around gave its gloomy antiquity an air of\ncomfort--an air even of luxury.\n\nIt was to this favorite retreat of the King's that Myles was brought\nthat morning with his father to face the great Earl of Alban.\n\nIn the anteroom the little party of Princes and nobles who escorted\nthe father and son had held a brief consultation. Then the others had\nentered, leaving Myles and his blind father in charge of Lord Lumley and\ntwo knights of the court, Sir Reginald Hallowell and Sir Piers Averell.\n\nMyles, as he stood patiently waiting, with his father's arm resting in\nhis, could hear the muffled sound of voices from beyond the arras. Among\nothers, he recognized the well-remembered tones of the King. He fancied\nthat he heard his own name mentioned more than once, and then the sound\nof talking ceased. The next moment the arras was drawn aside, and the\nEarl entered the antechamber again.\n\n\"All is ready, cousin,\" said he to Lord Falworth, in a suppressed voice.\n\"Essex hath done as he promised, and Alban is within there now.\" Then,\nturning to Myles, speaking in the same low voice, and betraying more\nagitation than Myles had thought it possible for him to show, \"Sir\nMyles,\" said he, \"remember all that hath been told thee. Thou knowest\nwhat thou hast to say and do.\" Then, without further word, he took Lord\nFalworth by the hand, and led the way into the room, Myles following\nclose behind.\n\nThe King half sat, half inclined, upon a cushioned seat close to which\nstood the two Princes. There were some dozen others present, mostly\npriests and noblemen of high quality who clustered in a group at a\nlittle distance. Myles knew most of them at a glance having seen them\ncome and go at Scotland Yard. But among them all, he singled out only\none--the Earl of Alban. He had not seen that face since he was a little\nchild eight years old, but now that he beheld it again, it fitted\ninstantly and vividly into the remembrance of the time of that terrible\nscene at Falworth Castle, when he had beheld the then Lord Brookhurst\nstanding above the dead body of Sir John Dale, with the bloody mace\nclinched in his hand. There were the same heavy black brows, sinister\nand gloomy, the same hooked nose, the same swarthy cheeks. He even\nremembered the deep dent in the forehead, where the brows met in\nperpetual frown. So it was that upon that face his looks centred and\nrested.\n\nThe Earl of Alban had just been speaking to some Lord who stood beside\nhim, and a half-smile still hung about the corners of his lips. At\nfirst, as he looked up at the entrance of the newcomers, there was no\nother expression; then suddenly came a flash of recognition, a look of\nwide-eyed amazement; then the blood left the cheeks and the lips, and\nthe face grew very pale. No doubt he saw at a flash that some great\ndanger overhung him in this sudden coming of his old enemy, for he was\nas keen and as astute a politician as he was a famous warrior. At least\nhe knew that the eyes of most of those present were fixed keenly and\nsearchingly upon him. After the first start of recognition, his left\nhand, hanging at his side, gradually closed around the scabbard of his\nsword, clutching it in a vice-like grip.\n\nMeantime the Earl of Mackworth had led the blind Lord to the King, where\nboth kneeled.\n\n\"Why, how now, my Lord?\" said the King. \"Methought it was our young\nPaladin whom we knighted at Devlen that was to be presented, and here\nthou bringest this old man. A blind man, ha! What is the meaning of\nthis?\"\n\n\"Majesty,\" said the Earl, \"I have taken this chance to bring to thy\nmerciful consideration one who hath most wofully and unjustly suffered\nfrom thine anger. Yonder stands the young knight of whom we spake; this\nis his father, Gilbert Reginald, whilom Lord Falworth, who craves mercy\nand justice at thy hands.\"\n\n\"Falworth,\" said the King, placing his hand to his head. \"The name is\nnot strange to mine ears, but I cannot place it. My head hath troubled\nme sorely to-day, and I cannot remember.\"\n\nAt this point the Earl of Alban came quietly and deliberately forward.\n\"Sire,\" said he, \"pardon my boldness in so venturing to address you, but\nhaply I may bring the name more clearly to your mind. He is, as my Lord\nof Mackworth said, the whilom Baron Falworth, the outlawed, attainted\ntraitor; so declared for the harboring of Sir John Dale, who was one of\nthose who sought your Majesty's life at Windsor eleven years ago.\nSire, he is mine enemy as well, and is brought hither by my proclaimed\nenemies. Should aught occur to my harm, I rest my case in your gracious\nhands.\"\n\nThe dusty red flamed into the King's pale, sickly face in answer, and he\nrose hastily from his seat.\n\n\"Aye,\" said he, \"I remember me now--I remember me the man and the name!\nWho hath dared bring him here before us?\" All the dull heaviness of\nsickness was gone for the moment, and King Henry was the King Henry of\nten years ago as he rolled his eyes balefully from one to another of the\ncourtiers who stood silently around.\n\nThe Earl of Mackworth shot a covert glance at the Bishop of Winchester,\nwho came forward in answer.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" said he, \"here am I, your brother, who beseech you as\nyour brother not to judge over-hastily in this matter. It is true\nthat this man has been adjudged a traitor, but he has been so adjudged\nwithout a hearing. I beseech thee to listen patiently to whatsoever he\nmay have to say.\"\n\nThe King fixed the Bishop with a look of the bitterest, deepest anger,\nholding his nether lip tightly under his teeth--a trick he had when\nstrongly moved with anger--and the Bishop's eyes fell under the look.\nMeantime the Earl of Alban stood calm and silent. No doubt he saw that\nthe King's anger was likely to befriend him more than any words that he\nhimself could say, and he perilled his case with no more speech which\ncould only prove superfluous.\n\nAt last the King turned a face red and swollen with anger to the blind\nLord, who still kneeled before him.\n\n\"What hast thou to say?\" he said, in a deep and sullen voice.\n\n\"Gracious and merciful Lord,\" said the blind nobleman, \"I come to thee,\nthe fountain-head of justice, craving justice. Sire, I do now and here\ndeny my treason, which denial I could not before make, being blind and\nhelpless, and mine enemies strong and malignant. But now, sire, Heaven\nhath sent me help, and therefore I do acclaim before thee that my\naccuser, William Bushy Brookhurst, Earl of Alban, is a foul and an\nattainted liar in all that he hath accused me of. To uphold which\nallegation, and to defend me, who am blinded by his unknightliness, I do\noffer a champion to prove all that I say with his body in combat.\"\n\nThe Earl of Mackworth darted a quick look at Myles, who came forward the\nmoment his father had ended, and kneeled beside him. The King offered no\ninterruption to his speech, but he bent a look heavy with anger upon the\nyoung man.\n\n\"My gracious Lord and King,\" said Myles, \"I, the son of the accused, do\noffer myself as his champion in this cause, beseeching thee of thy grace\nleave to prove the truth of the same, being a belted knight by thy grace\nand of thy creation and the peer of any who weareth spurs.\" Thereupon,\nrising, he drew his iron gauntlet from his girdle, and flung it clashing\ndown upon the floor, and with his heart swelling within him with anger\nand indignation and pity of his blind father, he cried, in a loud\nvoice, \"I do accuse thee, William of Alban, that thou liest vilely as\naforesaid, and here cast down my gage, daring thee to take it up.\"\n\nThe Earl of Alban made as though he would accept the challenge, but the\nKing stopped him hastily.\n\n\"Stop!\" he cried, harshly. \"Touch not the gage! Let it lie--let it lie,\nI tell thee, my Lord! Now then,\" said he, turning to the others, \"tell\nme what meaneth all this coil? Who brought this man hither?\"\n\nHe looked from one to another of those who stood silently around, but no\none answered.\n\n\"I see,\" said he, \"ye all have had to do with it. It is as my Lord of\nAlban sayeth; ye are his enemies, and ye are my enemies as well. In this\nI do smell a vile plot. I cannot undo what I have done, and since I have\nmade this young man a knight with mine own hands, I cannot deny that\nhe is fit to challenge my Lord of Alban. Ne'theless, the High Court of\nChivalry shall adjudge this case. Meantime,\" said he, turning to the\nEarl Marshal, who was present, \"I give thee this attainted Lord in\ncharge. Convey him presently to the Tower, and let him abide our\npleasure there. Also, thou mayst take up yon gage, and keep it till it\nis redeemed according to our pleasure.\"\n\nHe stood thoughtfully for a moment, and then raising his eyes, looked\nfixedly at the Earl of Mackworth. \"I know,\" he said, \"that I be a right\nsick man, and there be some who are already plotting to overthrow those\nwho have held up my hand with their own strength for all these years.\"\nThen speaking more directly: \"My Lord Earl of Mackworth, I see your hand\nin this before all others. It was thou who so played upon me as to get\nme to knight this young man, and thus make him worthy to challenge my\nLord of Alban. It was thy doings that brought him here to-day, backed\nby mine own sons and my brother and by these noblemen.\" Then turning\nsuddenly to the Earl of Alban: \"Come, my Lord,\" said he; \"I am aweary\nwith all this coil. Lend me thine arm to leave this place.\" So it\nwas that he left the room, leaning upon the Earl of Alban's arm, and\nfollowed by the two or three of the Alban faction who were present.\n\n\"Your Royal Highness,\" said the Earl Marshal, \"I must e'en do the King's\nbidding, and take this gentleman into arrest.\"\n\n\"Do thy duty,\" said the Prince. \"We knew it must come to this. Meanwhile\nhe is to be a prisoner of honor, and see that he be well lodged and\ncared for. Thou wilt find my barge at the stairs to convey him down the\nriver, and I myself will come this afternoon to visit him.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31\n\nIt was not until the end of July that the High Court of Chivalry\nrendered its judgment. There were many unusual points in the case, some\nof which bore heavily against Lord Falworth, some of which were in\nhis favor. He was very ably defended by the lawyers whom the Earl\nof Mackworth had engaged upon his side; nevertheless, under ordinary\ncircumstances, the judgment, no doubt, would have been quickly rendered\nagainst him. As it was, however, the circumstances were not ordinary,\nand it was rendered in his favor. The Court besought the King to grant\nthe ordeal by battle, to accept Lord Falworth's champion, and to appoint\nthe time and place for the meeting.\n\nThe decision must have been a most bitter, galling one for the sick\nKing. He was naturally of a generous, forgiving nature, but Lord\nFalworth in his time of power had been an unrelenting and fearless\nopponent, and his Majesty who, like most generous men, could on\noccasions be very cruel and intolerant, had never forgiven him. He had\nsteadily thrown the might of his influence with the Court against the\nFalworths' case, but that influence was no longer all-powerful for good\nor ill. He was failing in health, and it could only be a matter of a few\nyears, probably of only a few months, before his successor sat upon the\nthrone.\n\nUpon the other hand, the Prince of Wales's faction had been steadily,\nand of late rapidly, increasing in power, and in the Earl of Mackworth,\nits virtual head, it possessed one of the most capable politicians and\nastute intriguers in Europe. So, as the outcome of all the plotting and\ncounter-plotting, scheming and counter-scheming, the case was decided in\nLord Falworth's favor. The knowledge of the ultimate result was known\nto the Prince of Wales's circle almost a week before it was finally\ndecided. Indeed, the Earl of Mackworth had made pretty sure of that\nresult before he had summoned Myles from France, but upon the King it\nfell like the shock of a sudden blow. All that day he kept himself in\nmoody seclusion, nursing his silent, bitter anger, and making only\none outbreak, in which he swore by the Holy Rood that should Myles be\nworsted in the encounter, he would not take the battle into his own\nhands, but would suffer him to be slain, and furthermore, that should\nthe Earl show signs of failing at any time, he would do all in his power\nto save him. One of the courtiers who had been present, and who was\nsecretly inclined to the Prince of Wales's faction, had repeated this\nspeech at Scotland Yard, and the Prince had said, \"That meaneth, Myles,\nthat thou must either win or die.\"\n\n\"And so I would have it to be, my Lord,\" Myles had answered.\n\nIt was not until nearly a fortnight after the decision of the Court of\nChivalry had been rendered that the King announced the time and place\nof battle--the time to be the 3d of September, the place to be\nSmithfield--a spot much used for such encounters.\n\nDuring the three weeks or so that intervened between this announcement\nand the time of combat, Myles went nearly every day to visit the lists\nin course of erection. Often the Prince went with him; always two or\nthree of his friends of the Scotland Yard court accompanied him.\n\nThe lists were laid out in the usual form. The true or principal list in\nwhich the combatants were to engage was sixty yards long and forty yards\nwide; this rectangular space being surrounded by a fence about six feet\nhigh, painted vermilion. Between the fence and the stand where the King\nand the spectators sat, and surrounding the central space, was the\nouter or false list, also surrounded by a fence. In the false list the\nConstable and the Marshal and their followers and attendants were to be\nstationed at the time of battle to preserve the general peace during the\ncontest between the principals.\n\nOne day as Myles, his princely patron, and his friends entered the\nbarriers, leaving their horses at the outer gate, they met the Earl of\nAlban and his followers, who were just quitting the lists, which they\nalso were in the habit of visiting nearly every day. As the two parties\npassed one another, the Earl spoke to a gentleman walking beside him and\nin a voice loud enough to be clearly overheard by the others: \"Yonder\nis the young sprig of Falworth,\" said he. \"His father, my Lords, is\nnot content with forfeiting his own life for his treason, but must,\nforsooth, throw away his son's also. I have faced and overthrown many a\nbetter knight than that boy.\"\n\nMyles heard the speech, and knew that it was intended for him to hear\nit; but he paid no attention to it, walking composedly at the Prince's\nside. The Prince had also overheard it, and after a little space of\nsilence asked, \"Dost thou not feel anxiety for thy coming battle,\nMyles?\"\n\n\"Yea, my Lord,\" said Myles; \"sometimes I do feel anxiety, but not such\nas my Lord of Alban would have me feel in uttering the speech that he\nspake anon. It is anxiety for my father's sake and my mother's sake that\nI feel, for truly there are great matters for them pending upon this\nfight. Ne'theless, I do know that God will not desert me in my cause,\nfor verily my father is no traitor.\"\n\n\"But the Earl of Alban,\" said the Prince, gravely, \"is reputed one of\nthe best-skilled knights in all England; moreover, he is merciless and\nwithout generosity, so that an he gain aught advantage over thee, he\nwill surely slay thee.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid, my Lord,\" said Myles, still calmly and composedly.\n\n\"Nor am I afraid for thee, Myles,\" said the Prince, heartily, putting\nhis arm, as he spoke, around the young man's shoulder; \"for truly, wert\nthou a knight of forty years, instead of one of twenty, thou couldst not\nbear thyself with more courage.\"\n\nAs the time for the duel approached, the days seemed to drag themselves\nalong upon leaden feet; nevertheless, the days came and went, as all\ndays do, bringing with them, at last, the fateful 3d of September.\n\nEarly in the morning, while the sun was still level and red, the Prince\nhimself, unattended, came to Myles's apartment, in the outer room of\nwhich Gascoyne was bustling busily about arranging the armor piece by\npiece; renewing straps and thongs, but not whistling over his work as he\nusually did. The Prince nodded to him, and then passed silently through\nto the inner chamber. Myles was upon his knees, and Father Ambrose,\nthe Prince's chaplain, was beside him. The Prince stood silently at the\ndoor, until Myles, having told his last bead, rose and turned towards\nhim.\n\n\"My dear Lord,\" said the young knight, \"I give you gramercy for the\ngreat honor you do me in coming so early for to visit me.\"\n\n\"Nay, Myles, give me no thanks,\" said the Prince, frankly reaching him\nhis hand, which Myles took and set to his lips. \"I lay bethinking me of\nthee this morning, while yet in bed, and so, as I could not sleep any\nmore, I was moved to come hither to see thee.\"\n\nQuite a number of the Prince's faction were at the breakfast at Scotland\nYard that morning; among others, the Earl of Mackworth. All were more or\nless oppressed with anxiety, for nearly all of them had staked much upon\nthe coming battle. If Alban conquered, he would be more powerful to harm\nthem and to revenge himself upon them than ever, and Myles was a very\nyoung champion upon whom to depend. Myles himself, perhaps, showed as\nlittle anxiety as any; he certainly ate more heartily of his breakfast\nthat morning than many of the others.\n\nAfter the meal was ended, the Prince rose. \"The boat is ready at the\nstairs,\" said he; \"if thou wouldst go to the Tower to visit thy father,\nMyles, before hearing mass, I and Cholmondeley and Vere and Poins will\ngo with thee, if ye, Lords and gentlemen, will grant me your pardon\nfor leaving you. Are there any others that thou wouldst have accompany\nthee?\"\n\n\"I would have Sir James Lee and my squire, Master Gascoyne, if thou art\nso pleased to give them leave to go,\" answered Myles.\n\n\"So be it,\" said the Prince. \"We will stop at Mackworth stairs for the\nknight.\"\n\nThe barge landed at the west stairs of the Tower wharf, and the whole\nparty were received with more than usual civilities by the Governor, who\nconducted them at once to the Tower where Lord Falworth was lodged. Lady\nFalworth met them at the head of the stairs; her eyes were very red and\nher face pale, and as Myles raised her hand and set a long kiss upon it,\nher lips trembled, and she turned her face quickly away, pressing\nher handkerchief for one moment to her eyes. Poor lady! What agony of\nanxiety and dread did she not suffer for her boy's sake that day! Myles\nhad not hidden both from her and his father that he must either win or\ndie.\n\nAs Myles turned from his mother, Prior Edward came out from the inner\nchamber, and was greeted warmly by him. The old priest had arrived in\nLondon only the day before, having come down from Crosbey Priory to be\nwith his friend's family during this their time of terrible anxiety.\n\nAfter a little while of general talk, the Prince and his attendants\nretired, leaving the family together, only Sir James Lee and Gascoyne\nremaining behind.\n\nMany matters that had been discussed before were now finally settled,\nthe chief of which was the disposition of Lady Falworth in case the\nbattle should go against them. Then Myles took his leave, kissing his\nmother, who began crying, and comforting her with brave assurances.\nPrior Edward accompanied him as far as the head of the Tower stairs,\nwhere Myles kneeled upon the stone steps, while the good priest blessed\nhim and signed the cross upon his forehead. The Prince was waiting in\nthe walled garden adjoining, and as they rowed back again up the river\nto Scotland Yard, all were thoughtful and serious, even Poins' and\nVere's merry tongues being stilled from their usual quips and jesting.\n\nIt was about the quarter of the hour before eleven o'clock when Myles,\nwith Gascoyne, set forth for the lists. The Prince of Wales, together\nwith most of his court, had already gone on to Smithfield, leaving\nbehind him six young knights of his household to act as escort to the\nyoung champion. Then at last the order to horse was given; the great\ngate swung open, and out they rode, clattering and jingling, the\nsunlight gleaming and flaming and flashing upon their polished armor.\nThey drew rein to the right, and so rode in a little cloud of dust along\nthe Strand Street towards London town, with the breeze blowing merrily,\nand the sunlight shining as sweetly and blithesomely as though they were\nriding to a wedding rather than to a grim and dreadful ordeal that meant\neither victory or death.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32\n\nIn the days of King Edward III a code of laws relating to trial by\nbattle had been compiled for one of his sons, Thomas of Woodstock. In\nthis work each and every detail, to the most minute, had been arranged\nand fixed, and from that time judicial combats had been regulated in\naccordance with its mandates.\n\nIt was in obedience to this code that Myles Falworth appeared at the\neast gate of the lists (the east gate being assigned by law to the\nchallenger), clad in full armor of proof, attended by Gascoyne, and\naccompanied by two of the young knights who had acted as his escort from\nScotland Yard.\n\nAt the barriers he was met by the attorney Willingwood, the chief lawyer\nwho had conducted the Falworth case before the High Court of Chivalry,\nand who was to attend him during the administration of the oaths before\nthe King.\n\nAs Myles presented himself at the gate he was met by the Constable, the\nMarshal, and their immediate attendants. The Constable, laying his hand\nupon the bridle-rein, said, in a loud voice: \"Stand, Sir Knight, and\ntell me why thou art come thus armed to the gates of the lists. What is\nthy name? Wherefore art thou come?\"\n\nMyles answered, \"I am Myles Falworth, a Knight of the Bath by grace of\nhis Majesty King Henry IV and by his creation, and do come hither to\ndefend my challenge upon the body of William Bushy Brookhurst, Earl of\nAlban, proclaiming him an unknightly knight and a false and perjured\nliar, in that he hath accused Gilbert Reginald, Lord Falworth, of\ntreason against our beloved Lord, his Majesty the King, and may God\ndefend the right!\"\n\nAs he ended speaking, the Constable advanced close to his side, and\nformally raising the umbril of the helmet, looked him in the face.\nThereupon, having approved his identity, he ordered the gates to be\nopened, and bade Myles enter the lists with his squire and his friends.\n\nAt the south side of the lists a raised scaffolding had been built for\nthe King and those who looked on. It was not unlike that which had\nbeen erected at Devlen Castle when Myles had first jousted as belted\nknight--here were the same raised seat for the King, the tapestries, the\nhangings, the fluttering pennons, and the royal standard floating above;\nonly here were no fair-faced ladies looking down upon him, but instead,\nstern-browed Lords and knights in armor and squires, and here were no\nmerry laughing and buzz of talk and flutter of fans and kerchiefs, but\nall was very quiet and serious.\n\nMyles riding upon his horse, with Gascoyne holding the bridle-rein,\nand his attorney walking beside him with his hand upon the stirrups,\nfollowed the Constable across the lists to an open space in front of the\nseat where the King sat. Then, having reached his appointed station, he\nstopped, and the Constable, advancing to the foot of the stair-way that\nled to the dais above, announced in a loud voice that the challenger had\nentered the lists.\n\n\"Then called the defendant straightway,\" said the King, \"for noon\ndraweth nigh.\"\n\nThe day was very warm, and the sun, bright and unclouded, shone fiercely\ndown upon the open lists. Perhaps few men nowadays could bear the\nscorching heat of iron plates such as Myles wore, from which the body\nwas only protected by a leathern jacket and hose. But men's bodies in\nthose days were tougher and more seasoned to hardships of weather than\nthey are in these our times. Myles thought no more of the burning\niron plates that incased him than a modern soldier thinks of his dress\nuniform in warm weather. Nevertheless, he raised the umbril of his\nhelmet to cool his face as he waited the coming of his opponent. He\nturned his eyes upward to the row of seats on the scaffolding above,\nand even in the restless, bewildering multitude of strange faces turned\ntowards him recognized those that he knew: the Prince of Wales, his\ncompanions of the Scotland Yard household, the Duke of Clarence,\nthe Bishop of Winchester, and some of the noblemen of the Earl of\nMackworth's party, who had been buzzing about the Prince for the past\nmonth or so. But his glance swept over all these, rather perceiving\nthan seeing them, and then rested upon a square box-like compartment not\nunlike a prisoner's dock in the courtroom of our day, for in the box sat\nhis father, with the Earl of Mackworth upon one side and Sir James Lee\nupon the other. The blind man's face was very pale, but still wore its\nusual expression of calm serenity--the calm serenity of a blind face.\nThe Earl was also very pale, and he kept his eyes fixed steadfastly upon\nMyles with a keen and searching look, as though to pierce to the very\nbottom of the young man's heart, and discover if indeed not one little\nfragment of dryrot of fear or uncertainty tainted the solid courage of\nhis knighthood.\n\nThen he heard the criers calling the defendant at the four corners of\nthe list: \"Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! William Bushy Brookhurst, Earl of Alban,\ncome to this combat, in which you be enterprised this day to discharge\nyour sureties before the King, the Constable, and the Marshal, and to\nencounter in your defence Myles Falworth, knight, the accepted champion\nupon behalf of Gilbert Reginald Falworth, the challenger! Oyez! Oyez!\nOyez! Let the defendant come!\"\n\nSo they continued calling, until, by the sudden turning of all faces,\nMyles knew that his enemy was at hand.\n\nThen presently he saw the Earl and his attendants enter the outer gate\nat the west end of the barrier; he saw the Constable and Marshal meet\nhim; he saw the formal words of greeting pass; he saw the Constable\nraise the umbril of the helmet. Then the gate opened, and the Earl of\nAlban entered, clad cap-a-pie in a full suit of magnificent Milan armor\nwithout juppon or adornment of any kind. As he approached across the\nlists, Myles closed the umbril of his helmet, and then sat quite still\nand motionless, for the time was come.\n\nSo he sat, erect and motionless as a statue of iron, half hearing the\nreading of the long intricately-worded bills, absorbed in many thoughts\nof past and present things. At last the reading ended, and then he\ncalmly and composedly obeyed, under the direction of his attorney,\nthe several forms and ceremonies that followed; answered the various\nofficial questions, took the various oaths. Then Gascoyne, leading the\nhorse by the bridle-rein, conducted him back to his station at the east\nend of the lists.\n\nAs the faithful friend and squire made one last and searching\nexamination of arms and armor, the Marshal and the clerk came to the\nyoung champion and administered the final oath by which he swore that he\ncarried no concealed weapons.\n\nThe weapons allowed by the High Court were then measured and attested.\nThey consisted of the long sword, the short sword, the dagger, the mace,\nand a weapon known as the hand-gisarm, or glave-lot--a heavy swordlike\nblade eight palms long, a palm in breadth, and riveted to a stout handle\nof wood three feet long.\n\nThe usual lance had not been included in the list of arms, the\nhand-gisarm being substituted in its place. It was a fearful and\nmurderous weapon, though cumbersome, Unhandy, and ill adapted for quick\nor dexterous stroke; nevertheless, the Earl of Alban had petitioned\nthe King to have it included in the list, and in answer to the King's\nexpressed desire the Court had adopted it in the stead of the lance,\nyielding thus much to the royal wishes. Nor was it a small concession.\nThe hand-gisarm had been a weapon very much in vogue in King Richard's\nday, and was now nearly if not entirely out of fashion with the younger\ngeneration of warriors. The Earl of Alban was, of course, well used to\nthe blade; with Myles it was strange and new, either for attack or in\ndefence.\n\nWith the administration of the final oath and the examination of the\nweapons, the preliminary ceremonies came to an end, and presently Myles\nheard the criers calling to clear the lists. As those around him moved\nto withdraw, the young knight drew off his mailed gauntlet, and gave\nGascoyne's hand one last final clasp, strong, earnest, and intense with\nthe close friendship of young manhood, and poor Gascoyne looked up at\nhim with a face ghastly white.\n\nThen all were gone; the gates of the principal list and that of the\nfalse list were closed clashing, and Myles was alone, face to face, with\nhis mortal enemy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33\n\nThere was a little while of restless, rustling silence, during which the\nConstable took his place in the seat appointed for him directly in\nfront of and below the King's throne. A moment or two when even the\nrestlessness and the rustling were quieted, and then the King leaned\nforward and spoke to the Constable, who immediately called out, in a\nloud, clear voice.\n\n\"Let them go!\" Then again, \"Let them go!\" Then, for the third and last\ntime, \"Let them go and do their endeavor, in God's name!\"\n\nAt this third command the combatants, each of whom had till that moment\nbeen sitting as motionless as a statue of iron, tightened rein, and rode\nslowly and deliberately forward without haste, yet without hesitation,\nuntil they met in the very middle of the lists.\n\nIn the battle which followed, Myles fought with the long sword, the Earl\nwith the hand-gisarm for which he had asked. The moment they met, the\ncombat was opened, and for a time nothing was heard but the thunderous\nclashing and clamor of blows, now and then beating intermittently, now\nand then pausing. Occasionally, as the combatants spurred together,\nchecked, wheeled, and recovered, they would be hidden for a moment in\na misty veil of dust, which, again drifting down the wind, perhaps\nrevealed them drawn a little apart, resting their panting horses. Then,\nagain, they would spur together, striking as they passed, wheeling and\nstriking again.\n\nUpon the scaffolding all was still, only now and then for the buzz of\nmuffled exclamations or applause of those who looked on. Mostly the\napplause was from Myles's friends, for from the very first he showed and\nsteadily maintained his advantage over the older man. \"Hah! well struck!\nwell recovered!\" \"Look ye! the sword bit that time!\" \"Nay, look, saw ye\nhim pass the point of the gisarm?\" Then, \"Falworth! Falworth!\" as some\nmore than usually skilful stroke or parry occurred.\n\nMeantime Myles's father sat straining his sightless eyeballs, as though\nto pierce his body's darkness with one ray of light that would show him\nhow his boy held his own in the fight, and Lord Mackworth, leaning with\nhis lips close to the blind man's ear, told him point by point how the\nbattle stood.\n\n\"Fear not, Gilbert,\" said he at each pause in the fight. \"He holdeth his\nown right well.\" Then, after a while: \"God is with us, Gilbert. Alban\nis twice wounded and his horse faileth. One little while longer and the\nvictory is ours!\"\n\nA longer and more continuous interval of combat followed this\nlast assurance, during which Myles drove the assault fiercely and\nunrelentingly as though to overbear his enemy by the very power\nand violence of the blows he delivered. The Earl defended himself\ndesperately, but was borne back, back, back, farther and farther. Every\nnerve of those who looked on was stretched to breathless tensity, when,\nalmost as his enemy was against the barriers, Myles paused and rested.\n\n\"Out upon it!\" exclaimed the Earl of Mackworth, almost shrilly in his\nexcitement, as the sudden lull followed the crashing of blows. \"Why doth\nthe boy spare him? That is thrice he hath given him grace to recover;\nan he had pushed the battle that time he had driven him back against the\nbarriers.\"\n\nIt was as the Earl had said; Myles had three times given his enemy grace\nwhen victory was almost in his very grasp. He had three times spared\nhim, in spite of all he and those dear to him must suffer should his\ncruel and merciless enemy gain the victory. It was a false and foolish\ngenerosity, partly the fault of his impulsive youth--more largely of\nhis romantic training in the artificial code of French chivalry. He felt\nthat the battle was his, and so he gave his enemy these three chances to\nrecover, as some chevalier or knight-errant of romance might have\ndone, instead of pushing the combat to a mercifully speedy end--and his\nfoolish generosity cost him dear.\n\nIn the momentary pause that had thus stirred the Earl of Mackworth to\na sudden outbreak, the Earl of Alban sat upon his panting, sweating\nwar-horse, facing his powerful young enemy at about twelve paces\ndistant. He sat as still as a rock, holding his gisarm poised in front\nof him. He had, as the Earl of Mackworth had said, been wounded twice,\nand each time with the point of the sword, so much more dangerous than a\ndirect cut with the weapon. One wound was beneath his armor, and no one\nbut he knew how serious it might be; the other was under the overlapping\nof the epauhere, and from it a finger's-breadth of blood ran straight\ndown his side and over the housings of his horse. From without, the\nstill motionless iron figure appeared calm and expressionless; within,\nwho knows what consuming blasts of hate, rage, and despair swept his\nheart as with a fiery whirlwind.\n\nAs Myles looked at the motionless, bleeding figure, his breast swelled\nwith pity. \"My Lord,\" said he, \"thou art sore wounded and the fight is\nagainst thee; wilt thou not yield thee?\"\n\nNo one but that other heard the speech, and no one but Myles heard the\nanswer that came back, hollow, cavernous, \"Never, thou dog! Never!\"\n\nThen in an instant, as quick as a flash, his enemy spurred straight upon\nMyles, and as he spurred he struck a last desperate, swinging blow, in\nwhich he threw in one final effort all the strength of hate, of fury,\nand of despair. Myles whirled his horse backward, warding the blow with\nhis shield as he did so. The blade glanced from the smooth face of the\nshield, and, whether by mistake or not, fell straight and true, and with\nalmost undiminished force, upon the neck of Myles's war-horse, and just\nbehind the ears. The animal staggered forward, and then fell upon its\nknees, and at the same instant the other, as though by the impetus of\nthe rush, dashed full upon it with all the momentum lent by the weight\nof iron it carried. The shock was irresistible, and the stunned and\nwounded horse was flung upon the ground, rolling over and over. As his\nhorse fell, Myles wrenched one of his feet out of the stirrup; the other\ncaught for an instant, and he was flung headlong with stunning violence,\nhis armor crashing as he fell. In the cloud of dust that arose no\none could see just what happened, but that what was done was done\ndeliberately no one doubted. The earl, at once checking and spurring\nhis foaming charger, drove the iron-shod war-horse directly over Myles's\nprostrate body. Then, checking him fiercely with the curb, reined him\nback, the hoofs clashing and crashing, over the figure beneath. So\nhe had ridden over the father at York, and so he rode over the son at\nSmithfield.\n\nMyles, as he lay prostrate and half stunned by his fall, had seen his\nenemy thus driving his rearing horse down upon him, but was not able to\ndefend himself. A fallen knight in full armor was utterly powerless to\nrise without assistance; Myles lay helpless in the clutch of the very\niron that was his defence. He closed his eyes involuntarily, and then\nhorse and rider were upon him. There was a deafening, sparkling crash,\na glimmering faintness, then another crash as the horse was reined\nfuriously back again, and then a humming stillness.\n\nIn a moment, upon the scaffolding all was a tumult of uproar and\nconfusion, shouting and gesticulation; only the King sat calm, sullen,\nimpassive. The Earl wheeled his horse and sat for a moment or two as\nthough to make quite sure that he knew the King's mind. The blow that\nhad been given was foul, unknightly, but the King gave no sign either of\nacquiescence or rebuke; he had willed that Myles was to die.\n\nThen the Earl turned again, and rode deliberately up to his prostrate\nenemy.\n\nWhen Myles opened his eyes after that moment of stunning silence, it was\nto see the other looming above him on his war-horse, swinging his gisarm\nfor one last mortal blow--pitiless, merciless.\n\nThe sight of that looming peril brought back Myles's wandering senses\nlike a flash of lightning. He flung up his shield, and met the blow even\nas it descended, turning it aside. It only protracted the end.\n\nOnce more the Earl of Alban raised the gisarm, swinging it twice around\nhis head before he struck. This time, though the shield glanced it, the\nblow fell upon the shoulder-piece, biting through the steel plate and\nleathern jack beneath even to the bone. Then Myles covered his head with\nhis shield as a last protecting chance for life.\n\nFor the third time the Earl swung the blade flashing, and then it fell,\nstraight and true, upon the defenceless body, just below the left arm,\nbiting deep through the armor plates. For an instant the blade stuck\nfast, and that instant was Myles's salvation. Under the agony of the\nblow he gave a muffled cry, and almost instinctively grasped the shaft\nof the weapon with both hands. Had the Earl let go his end of the\nweapon, he would have won the battle at his leisure and most easily; as\nit was, he struggled violently to wrench the gisarm away from Myles. In\nthat short, fierce struggle Myles was dragged to his knees, and then,\nstill holding the weapon with one hand, he clutched the trappings of the\nEarl's horse with the other. The next moment he was upon his feet. The\nother struggled to thrust him away, but Myles, letting go the gisarm,\nwhich he held with his left hand, clutched him tightly by the sword-belt\nin the intense, vise-like grip of despair. In vain the Earl strove to\nbeat him loose with the shaft of the gisarm, in vain he spurred and\nreared his horse to shake him off; Myles held him tight, in spite of all\nhis struggles.\n\nHe felt neither the streaming blood nor the throbbing agony of his\nwounds; every faculty of soul, mind, body, every power of life, was\ncentered in one intense, burning effort. He neither felt, thought, nor\nreasoned, but clutching, with the blindness of instinct, the heavy,\nspiked, iron-headed mace that hung at the Earl's saddle-bow, he gave it\none tremendous wrench that snapped the plaited leathern thongs that held\nit as though they were skeins of thread. Then, grinding his teeth as\nwith a spasm, he struck as he had never struck before--once, twice,\nthrice full upon the front of the helmet. Crash! crash! And then, even\nas the Earl toppled sidelong, crash! And the iron plates split and\ncrackled under the third blow. Myles had one flashing glimpse of an\nawful face, and then the saddle was empty.\n\nThen, as he held tight to the horse, panting, dizzy, sick to death, he\nfelt the hot blood gushing from his side, filling his body armor, and\nstaining the ground upon which he stood. Still he held tightly to the\nsaddle-bow of the fallen man's horse until, through his glimmering\nsight, he saw the Marshal, the Lieutenant, and the attendants gather\naround him. He heard the Marshal ask him, in a voice that sounded faint\nand distant, if he was dangerously wounded. He did not answer, and one\nof the attendants, leaping from his horse, opened the umbril of his\nhelmet, disclosing the dull, hollow eyes, the ashy, colorless lips, and\nthe waxy forehead, upon which stood great beads of sweat.\n\n\"Water! water!\" he cried, hoarsely; \"give me to drink!\" Then, quitting\nhis hold upon the horse, he started blindly across the lists towards the\ngate of the barrier. A shadow that chilled his heart seemed to fall upon\nhim. \"It is death,\" he muttered; then he stopped, then swayed for an\ninstant, and then toppled headlong, crashing as he fell.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBut Myles was not dead. Those who had seen his face when the umbril of\nthe helmet was raised, and then saw him fall as he tottered across the\nlists, had at first thought so. But his faintness was more from loss\nof blood and the sudden unstringing of nerve and sense from the intense\nfurious strain of the last few moments of battle than from the vital\nnature of the wound. Indeed, after Myles had been carried out of the\nlists and laid upon the ground in the shade between the barriers,\nMaster Thomas, the Prince's barber-surgeon, having examined the wounds,\ndeclared that he might be even carried on a covered litter to Scotland\nYard without serious danger. The Prince was extremely desirous of having\nhim under his care, and so the venture was tried. Myles was carried to\nScotland Yard, and perhaps was none the worse therefore. The Prince, the\nEarl of Mackworth, and two or three others stood silently watching as\nthe worthy shaver and leecher, assisted by his apprentice and Gascoyne,\nwashed and bathed the great gaping wound in the side, and bound it with\nlinen bandages. Myles lay with closed eyelids, still, pallid, weak as\na little child. Presently he opened his eyes and turned them, dull and\nlanguid, to the Prince.\n\n\"What hath happed my father, my Lord?\" said he, in a faint, whispering\nvoice.\n\n\"Thou hath saved his life and honor, Myles,\" the Prince answered. \"He\nis here now, and thy mother hath been sent for, and cometh anon with the\npriest who was with them this morn.\"\n\nMyles dropped his eyelids again; his lips moved, but he made no sound,\nand then two bright tears trickled across his white cheek.\n\n\"He maketh a woman of me,\" the Prince muttered through his teeth, and\nthen, swinging on his heel, he stood for a long time looking out of the\nwindow into the garden beneath.\n\n\"May I see my father?\" said Myles, presently, without opening his eyes.\n\nThe Prince turned around and looked inquiringly at the surgeon.\n\nThe good man shook his head. \"Not to-day,\" said he; \"haply to-morrow he\nmay see him and his mother. The bleeding is but new stanched, and such\nmatters as seeing his father and mother may make the heart to swell, and\nso maybe the wound burst afresh and he die. An he would hope to live, he\nmust rest quiet until to-morrow day.\"\n\nBut though Myles's wound was not mortal, it was very serious. The fever\nwhich followed lingered longer than common--perhaps because of the hot\nweather--and the days stretched to weeks, and the weeks to months, and\nstill he lay there, nursed by his mother and Gascoyne and Prior Edward,\nand now and again by Sir James Lee.\n\nOne day, a little before the good priest returned to Saint Mary's\nPriory, as he sat by Myles's bedside, his hands folded, and his sight\nturned inward, the young man suddenly said, \"Tell me, holy father, is it\nalways wrong for man to slay man?\"\n\nThe good priest sat silent for so long a time that Myles began to think\nhe had not heard the question. But by-and-by he answered, almost with a\nsigh, \"It is a hard question, my son, but I must in truth say, meseems\nit is not always wrong.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Myles, \"I have been in battle when men were slain, but never\ndid I think thereon as I have upon this matter. Did I sin in so slaying\nmy father's enemy?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Prior Edward, quietly, \"thou didst not sin. It was for\nothers thou didst fight, my son, and for others it is pardonable to do\nbattle. Had it been thine own quarrel, it might haply have been more\nhard to have answered thee.\"\n\nWho can gainsay, even in these days of light, the truth of this that the\ngood priest said to the sick lad so far away in the past?\n\n\nOne day the Earl of Mackworth came to visit Myles. At that time the\nyoung knight was mending, and was sitting propped up with pillows, and\nwas wrapped in Sir James Lee's cloak, for the day was chilly. After a\nlittle time of talk, a pause of silence fell.\n\n\"My Lord,\" said Myles, suddenly, \"dost thou remember one part of a\nmatter we spoke of when I first came from France?\"\n\nThe Earl made no pretence of ignorance. \"I remember,\" said he, quietly,\nlooking straight into the young man's thin white face.\n\n\"And have I yet won the right to ask for the Lady Alice de Mowbray to\nwife?\" said Myles, the red rising faintly to his cheeks.\n\n\"Thou hast won it,\" said the Earl, with a smile.\n\nMyles's eyes shone and his lips trembled with the pang of sudden joy\nand triumph, for he was still very weak. \"My Lord,\" said he, presently\n\"belike thou camest here to see me for this very matter?\"\n\nThe Earl smiled again without answering, and Myles knew that he had\nguessed aright. He reached out one of his weak, pallid hands from\nbeneath the cloak. The Earl of Mackworth took it with a firm pressure,\nthen instantly quitting it again, rose, as if ashamed of his emotion,\nstamped his feet, as though in pretence of being chilled, and then\ncrossed the room to where the fire crackled brightly in the great stone\nfireplace.\n\n\nLittle else remains to be told; only a few loose strands to tie, and the\nstory is complete.\n\nThough Lord Falworth was saved from death at the block, though his honor\nwas cleansed from stain, he was yet as poor and needy as ever. The\nKing, in spite of all the pressure brought to bear upon him, refused to\nrestore the estates of Falworth and Easterbridge--the latter of which\nhad again reverted to the crown upon the death of the Earl of Alban\nwithout issue--upon the grounds that they had been forfeited not because\nof the attaint of treason, but because of Lord Falworth having refused\nto respond to the citation of the courts. So the business dragged along\nfor month after month, until in January the King died suddenly in the\nJerusalem Chamber at Westminster. Then matters went smoothly enough, and\nFalworth and Mackworth swam upon the flood-tide of fortune.\n\n\nSo Myles was married, for how else should the story end? And one day\nhe brought his beautiful young wife home to Falworth Castle, which his\nfather had given him for his own, and at the gateway of which he was met\nby Sir James Lee and by the newly-knighted Sir Francis Gascoyne.\n\nOne day, soon after this home-coming, as he stood with her at an open\nwindow into which came blowing the pleasant May-time breeze, he suddenly\nsaid, \"What didst thou think of me when I first fell almost into thy\nlap, like an apple from heaven?\"\n\n\"I thought thou wert a great, good-hearted boy, as I think thou art\nnow,\" said she, twisting his strong, sinewy fingers in and out.\n\n\"If thou thoughtst me so then, what a very fool I must have looked to\nthee when I so clumsily besought thee for thy favor for my jousting at\nDevlen. Did I not so?\"\n\n\"Thou didst look to me the most noble, handsome young knight that did\never live; thou didst look to me Sir Galahad, as they did call thee,\nwithouten taint or stain.\"\n\nMyles did not even smile in answer, but looked at his wife with such a\nlook that she blushed a rosy red. Then, laughing, she slipped from his\nhold, and before he could catch her again was gone.\n\nI am glad that he was to be rich and happy and honored and beloved after\nall his hard and noble fighting.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Men of Iron, by Howard Pyle\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MEN OF IRON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1557.txt or 1557.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/5/1557/\n\nProduced by Charles Keller and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
