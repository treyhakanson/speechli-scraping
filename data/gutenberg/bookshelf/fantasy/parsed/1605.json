THE COMING OF PAN\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIN the centre of the pine wood called Coilla Doraca there lived not long\nago two Philosophers. They were wiser than anything else in the world\nexcept the Salmon who lies in the pool of Glyn Cagny into which the nuts\nof knowledge fall from the hazel bush on its bank. He, of course, is the\nmost profound of living creatures, but the two Philosophers are next to\nhim in wisdom. Their faces looked as though they were made of parchment,\nthere was ink under their nails, and every difficulty that was submitted\nto them, even by women, they were able to instantly resolve. The Grey\nWoman of Dun Gortin and the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath asked them the\nthree questions which nobody had ever been able to answer, and they were\nable to answer them. That was how they obtained the enmity of these two\nwomen which is more valuable than the friendship of angels. The Grey\nWoman and the Thin Woman were so incensed at being answered that they\nmarried the two Philosophers in order to be able to pinch them in bed,\nbut the skins of the Philosophers were so thick that they did not know\nthey were being pinched. They repaid the fury of the women with such\ntender affection that these vicious creatures almost expired of chagrin,\nand once, in a very ecstacy of exasperation, after having been kissed\nby their husbands, they uttered the fourteen hundred maledictions which\ncomprised their wisdom, and these were learned by the Philosophers who\nthus became even wiser than before.\n\nIn due process of time two children were born of these marriages. They\nwere born on the same day and in the same hour, and they were only\ndifferent in this, that one of them was a boy and the other one was a\ngirl. Nobody was able to tell how this had happened, and, for the first\ntime in their lives, the Philosophers were forced to admire an event\nwhich they had been unable to prognosticate; but having proved by many\ndifferent methods that the children were really children, that what\nmust be must be, that a fact cannot be controverted, and that what\nhas happened once may happen twice, they described the occurrence\nas extraordinary but not unnatural, and submitted peacefully to a\nProvidence even wiser than they were.\n\nThe Philosopher who had the boy was very pleased because, he said, there\nwere too many women in the world, and the Philosopher who had the girl\nwas very pleased also because, he said, you cannot have too much of a\ngood thing: the Grey Woman and the Thin Woman, however, were not in the\nleast softened by maternity-they said that they had not bargained for\nit, that the children were gotten under false presences, that they were\nrespectable married women, and that, as a protest against their wrongs,\nthey would not cook any more food for the Philosophers. This was\npleasant news for their husbands, who disliked the women's cooking\nvery much, but they did not say so, for the women would certainly\nhave insisted on their rights to cook had they imagined their husbands\ndisliked the results: therefore, the Philosophers besought their wives\nevery day to cook one of their lovely dinners again, and this the women\nalways refused to do.\n\nThey all lived together in a small house in the very centre of a dark\npine wood. Into this place the sun never shone because the shade was too\ndeep, and no wind ever came there either, because the boughs were too\nthick, so that it was the most solitary and quiet place in the world,\nand the Philosophers were able to hear each other thinking all day long,\nor making speeches to each other, and these were the pleasantest\nsounds they knew of. To them there were only two kinds of sounds\nanywhere--these were conversation and noise: they liked the first very\nmuch indeed, but they spoke of the second with stern disapproval, and,\neven when it was made by a bird, a breeze, or a shower of rain, they\ngrew angry and demanded that it should be abolished. Their wives seldom\nspoke at all and yet they were never silent: they communicated with each\nother by a kind of physical telegraphy which they had learned among the\nShee-they cracked their finger-joints quickly or slowly and so were able\nto communicate with each other over immense distances, for by dint of\nlong practice they could make great explosive sounds which were nearly\nlike thunder, and gentler sounds like the tapping of grey ashes on a\nhearthstone. The Thin Woman hated her own child, but she loved the Grey\nWoman's baby, and the Grey Woman loved the Thin Woman's infant but could\nnot abide her own. A compromise may put an end to the most perplexing\nof situations, and, consequently, the two women swapped children, and\nat once became the most tender and amiable mothers imaginable, and the\nfamilies were able to live together in a more perfect amity than could\nbe found anywhere else.\n\nThe children grew in grace and comeliness. At first the little boy was\nshort and fat and the little girl was long and thin, then the little\ngirl became round and chubby while the little boy grew lanky and wiry.\nThis was because the little girl used to sit very quiet and be good and\nthe little boy used not.\n\nThey lived for many years in the deep seclusion of the pine wood wherein\na perpetual twilight reigned, and here they were wont to play their\nchildish games, flitting among the shadowy trees like little quick\nshadows. At times their mothers, the Grey Woman and the Thin Woman,\nplayed with them, but this was seldom, and sometimes their fathers, the\ntwo Philosophers, came out and looked at them through spectacles which\nwere very round and very glassy, and had immense circles of horn all\nround the edges. They had, however, other playmates with whom they could\nromp all day long. There were hundreds of rabbits running about in the\nbrushwood; they were full of fun and were very fond of playing with the\nchildren. There were squirrels who joined cheerfully in their games, and\nsome goats, having one day strayed in from the big world, were made so\nwelcome that they always came again whenever they got the chance. There\nwere birds also, crows and blackbirds and willy-wagtails, who were well\nacquainted with the youngsters, and visited them as frequently as their\nbusy lives permitted.\n\nAt a short distance from their home there was a clearing in the wood\nabout ten feet square; through this clearing, as through a funnel, the\nsun for a few hours in the summer time blazed down. It was the boy who\nfirst discovered the strange radiant shaft in the wood. One day he had\nbeen sent out to collect pine cones for the fire. As these were gathered\ndaily the supply immediately near the house was scanty, therefore he\nhad, while searching for more, wandered further from his home than\nusual. The first sight of the extraordinary blaze astonished him. He\nhad never seen anything like it before, and the steady, unwinking glare\naroused his fear and curiosity equally. Curiosity will conquer fear\neven more than bravery will; indeed, it has led many people into dangers\nwhich mere physical courage would shudder away from, for hunger and love\nand curiosity are the great impelling forces of life. When the little\nboy found that the light did not move he drew closer to it, and at last,\nemboldened by curiosity, he stepped right into it and found that it was\nnot a thing at all. The instant that he stepped into the light he found\nit was hot, and this so frightened him that he jumped out of it again\nand ran behind a tree. Then he jumped into it for a moment and out of it\nagain, and for nearly half an hour he played a splendid game of tip and\ntig with the sunlight. At last he grew quite bold and stood in it and\nfound that it did not burn him at all, but he did not like to remain\nin it, fearing that he might be cooked. When he went home with the pine\ncones he said nothing to the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin or to the Thin\nWoman of Inis Magrath or to the two Philosophers, but he told the little\ngirl all about it when they went to bed, and every day afterwards they\nused to go and play with the sunlight, and the rabbits and the squirrels\nwould follow them there and join in their games with twice the interest\nthey had shown before.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTo the lonely house in the pine wood people sometimes came for advice\non subjects too recondite for even those extremes of elucidation, the\nparish priest and the tavern. These people were always well received,\nand their perplexities were attended to instantly, for the Philosophers\nliked being wise and they were not ashamed to put their learning to\nthe proof, nor were they, as so many wise people are, fearful lest they\nshould become poor or less respected by giving away their knowledge.\nThese were favourite maxims with them:\n\nYou must be fit to give before you can be fit to receive.\n\nKnowledge becomes lumber in a week, therefore, get rid of it.\n\nThe box must be emptied before it can be refilled.\n\nRefilling is progress.\n\nA sword, a spade, and a thought should never be allowed to rust.\n\nThe Grey Woman and the Thin Woman, however, held opinions quite contrary\nto these, and their maxims also were different:\n\nA secret is a weapon and a friend.\n\nMan is God's secret, Power is man's secret, Sex is woman's secret.\n\nBy having much you are fitted to have more.\n\nThere is always room in the box.\n\nThe art of packing is the last lecture of wisdom.\n\nThe scalp of your enemy is progress.\n\nHolding these opposed views it seemed likely that visitors seeking for\nadvice from the Philosophers might be astonished and captured by their\nwives; but the women were true to their own doctrines and refused to\npart with information to any persons saving only those of high rank,\nsuch as policemen, gombeen men, and district and county councillors;\nbut even to these they charged high prices for their information, and a\nbonus on any gains which accrued through the following of their advices.\nIt is unnecessary to state that their following was small when compared\nwith those who sought the assistance of their husbands, for scarcely a\nweek passed but some person came through the pine wood with his brows in\na tangle of perplexity.\n\nIn these people the children were deeply interested. They used to go\napart afterwards and talk about them, and would try to remember what\nthey looked like, how they talked, and their manner of walking or taking\nsnuff. After a time they became interested in the problems which these\npeople submitted to their parents and the replies or instructions\nwherewith the latter relieved them. Long training had made the\nchildren able to sit perfectly quiet, so that when the talk came to the\ninteresting part they were entirely forgotten, and ideas which might\notherwise have been spared their youth became the commonplaces of their\nconversation.\n\nWhen the children were ten years of age one of the Philosophers died. He\ncalled the household together and announced that the time had come when\nhe must bid them all good-bye, and that his intention was to die as\nquickly as might be. It was, he continued, an unfortunate thing that his\nhealth was at the moment more robust than it had been for a long time,\nbut that, of course, was no obstacle to his resolution, for death did\nnot depend upon ill-health but upon a multitude of other factors with\nthe details whereof he would not trouble them.\n\nHis wife, the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin, applauded this resolution and\nadded as an amendment that it was high time he did something, that the\nlife he had been leading was an arid and unprofitable one, that he had\nstolen her fourteen hundred maledictions for which he had no use and\npresented her with a child for which she had none, and that, all things\nconcerned, the sooner he did die and stop talking the sooner everybody\nconcerned would be made happy.\n\nThe other Philosopher replied mildly as he lit his pipe: \"Brother,\nthe greatest of all virtues is curiosity, and the end of all desire\nis wisdom; tell us, therefore, by what steps you have arrived at this\ncommendable resolution.\"\n\nTo this the Philosopher replied: \"I have attained to all the wisdom\nwhich I am fitted to bear. In the space of one week no new truth has\ncome to me. All that I have read lately I knew before; all that I have\nthought has been but a recapitulation of old and wearisome ideas. There\nis no longer an horizon before my eves. Space has narrowed to the petty\ndimensions of my thumb. Time is the tick of a clock. Good and evil are\ntwo peas in the one pod. My wife's face is the same for ever. I want to\nplay with the children, and yet I do not want to. Your conversation with\nme, brother, is like the droning of a bee in a dark cell. The pine trees\ntake root and grow and die.--It's all bosh. Good-bye.\"\n\nHis friend replied:\n\n\"Brother, these are weighty reflections, and I do clearly perceive that\nthe time has come for you to stop. I might observe, not in order to\ncombat your views, but merely to continue an interesting conversation,\nthat there are still some knowledges which you have not assimilated--you\ndo not yet know how to play the tambourine, nor how to be nice to your\nwife, nor how to get up first in the morning and cook the breakfast.\nHave you learned how to smoke strong tobacco as I do? or can you dance\nin the moonlight with a woman of the Shee? To understand the theory\nwhich underlies all things is not sufficient. It has occurred to me,\nbrother, that wisdom may not be the end of everything. Goodness and\nkindliness are, perhaps, beyond wisdom. Is it not possible that the\nultimate end is gaiety and music and a dance of joy? Wisdom is the\noldest of all things. Wisdom is all head and no heart. Behold, brother,\nyou are being crushed under the weight of your head. You are dying of\nold age while you are yet a child.\"\n\n\"Brother,\" replied the other Philosopher, \"your voice is like the\ndroning of a bee in a dark cell. If in my latter days I am reduced to\nplaying on the tambourine and running after a hag in the moonlight, and\ncooking your breakfast in the grey morning, then it is indeed time that\nI should die. Good-bye, brother.\"\n\nSo saying, the Philosopher arose and removed all the furniture to the\nsides of the room so that there was a clear space left in the centre.\nHe then took off his boots and his coat, and standing on his toes he\ncommenced to gyrate with extraordinary rapidity. In a few moments his\nmovements became steady and swift, and a sound came from him like the\nhumming of a swift saw; this sound grew deeper and deeper, and at last\ncontinuous, so that the room was filled with a thrilling noise. In a\nquarter of an hour the movement began to noticeably slacken. In another\nthree minutes it was quite slow. In two more minutes he grew visible\nagain as a body, and then he wobbled to and fro, and at last dropped\nin a heap on the floor. He was quite dead, and on his face was an\nexpression of serene beatitude.\n\n\"God be with you, brother,\" said the remaining Philosopher, and he lit\nhis pipe, focused his vision on the extreme tip of his nose, and began\nto meditate profoundly on the aphorism whether the good is the all or\nthe all is the good. In another moment he would have become oblivious of\nthe room, the company, and the corpse, but the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin\nshattered his meditation by a demand for advice as to what should next\nbe done. The Philosopher, with an effort, detached his eyes from his\nnose and his mind from his maxim.\n\n\"Chaos,\" said he, \"is the first condition. Order is the first law.\nContinuity is the first reflection. Quietude is the first happiness. Our\nbrother is dead--bury him.\" So saying, he returned his eyes to his nose,\nand his mind to his maxim, and lapsed to a profound reflection wherein\nnothing sat perched on insubstantiality, and the Spirit of Artifice\ngoggled at the puzzle.\n\nThe Grey Woman of Dun Gortin took a pinch of snuff from her box and\nraised the keen over her husband:\n\n\"You were my husband and you are dead.\n\nIt is wisdom that has killed you.\n\nIf you had listened to my wisdom instead of to your own you would still\nbe a trouble to me and I would still be happy.\n\nWomen are stronger than men--they do not die of wisdom.\n\nThey are better than men because they do not seek wisdom.\n\nThey are wiser than men because they know less and understand more.\n\nI had fourteen hundred maledictions, my little store, and by a trick you\nstole them and left me empty.\n\nYou stole my wisdom and it has broken your neck.\n\nI lost my knowledge and I am yet alive raising the keen over your body,\nbut it was too heavy for you, my little knowledge.\n\nYou will never go out into the pine wood in the morning, or wander\nabroad on a night of stars.\n\nYou will not sit in the chimney-corner on the hard nights, or go to bed,\nor rise again, or do anything at all from this day out.\n\nWho will gather pine cones now when the fire is going down, or call my\nname in the empty house, or be angry when the kettle is not boiling?\n\nNow I am desolate indeed. I have no knowledge, I have no husband, I have\nno more to say.\"\n\n\"If I had anything better you should have it,\" said she politely to the\nThin Woman of Inis Magrath.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Thin Woman, \"it was very nice. Shall I begin now?\nMy husband is meditating and we may be able to annoy him.\"\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself,\" replied the other, \"I am past enjoyment and\nam, moreover, a respectable woman.\"\n\n\"That is no more than the truth, indeed.\"\n\n\"I have always done the right thing at the right time.\"\n\n\"I'd be the last body in the world to deny that,\" was the warm response.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said the Grey Woman, and she commenced to take off\nher boots. She stood in the centre of the room and balanced herself on\nher toe.\n\n\"You are a decent, respectable lady,\" said the Thin Woman of Inis\nMagrath, and then the Grey Woman began to gyrate rapidly and more\nrapidly until she was a very fervour of motion, and in three-quarters\nof an hour (for she was very tough) she began to slacken, grew visible,\nwobbled, and fell beside her dead husband, and on her face was a\nbeatitude almost surpassing his.\n\nThe Thin Woman of Inis Magrath smacked the children and put them to bed,\nnext she buried the two bodies under the hearthstone, and then, with\nsome trouble, detached her husband from his meditations. When he became\ncapable of ordinary occurrences she detailed all that had happened, and\nsaid that he alone was to blame for the sad bereavement. He replied:\n\n\"The toxin generates the anti-toxin. The end lies concealed in the\nbeginning. All bodies grow around a skeleton. Life is a petticoat about\ndeath. I will not go to bed.\"\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nON the day following this melancholy occurrence Meehawl MacMurrachu,\na small farmer in the neighbourhood, came through the pine trees with\ntangled brows. At the door of the little house he said, \"God be with all\nhere,\" and marched in.\n\nThe Philosopher removed his pipe from his lips-\"God be with yourself,\"\nsaid he, and he replaced his pipe.\n\nMeehawl MacMurrachu crooked his thumb at space, \"Where is the other one?\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"He might be outside, maybe?\"\n\n\"He might, indeed,\" said the Philosopher gravely.\n\n\"Well, it doesn't matter,\" said the visitor, \"for you have enough\nknowledge by yourself to stock a shop. The reason I came here to-day was\nto ask your honoured advice about my wife's washing-board. She only has\nit a couple of years, and the last time she used it was when she washed\nout my Sunday shirt and her black skirt with the red things on it--you\nknow the one?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Well, anyhow, the washboard is gone, and my wife says it was either\ntaken by the fairies or by Bessie Hannigan--you know Bessie Hannigan?\nShe has whiskers like a goat and a lame leg!\" \"I do not,\" said the\nPhilosopher.\n\n\"No matter,\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu. \"She didn't take it, because my\nwife got her out yesterday and kept her talking for two hours while\nI went through everything in her bit of a house--the washboard wasn't\nthere.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Maybe your honour could tell a body where it is then?\"\n\n\"Maybe I could,\" said the Philosopher; \"are you listening?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu.\n\nThe Philosopher drew his chair closer to the visitor until their knees\nwere jammed together. He laid both his hands on Meehawl MacMurrachu's\nknees \"Washing is an extraordinary custom,\" said he. \"We are washed both\non coming into the world and on going out of it, and we take no pleasure\nfrom the first washing nor any profit from the last.\"\n\n\"True for you, sir,\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu.\n\n\"Many people consider that scourings supplementary to these are only due\nto habit. Now, habit is continuity of action, it is a most detestable\nthing and is very difficult to get away from. A proverb will run where\na writ will not, and the follies of our forefathers are of greater\nimportance to us than is the well-being of our posterity.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say a word against that, sir,\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu.\n\n\"Cats are a philosophic and thoughtful race, but they do not admit the\nefficacy of either water or soap, and yet it is usually conceded that\nthey are cleanly folk. There are exceptions to every rule, and I once\nknew a cat who lusted after water and bathed daily: he was an unnatural\nbrute and died ultimately of the head staggers. Children are nearly as\nwise as cats. It is true that they will utilize water in a variety of\nways, for instance, the destruction of a tablecloth or a pinafore, and I\nhave observed them greasing a ladder with soap, showing in the process a\ngreat knowledge of the properties of this material.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't they, to be sure?\" said Meehawl MacMurrachu. \"Have you\ngot a match, sir?\"\n\n\"I have not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Sparrows, again, are a highly acute\nand reasonable folk. They use water to quench thirst, but when they are\ndirty they take a dust bath and are at once cleansed. Of course, birds\nare often seen in the water, but they go there to catch fish and not to\nwash. I have often fancied that fish are a dirty, sly, and unintelligent\npeople--this is due to their staying so much in the water, and it has\nbeen observed that on being removed from this element they at once\nexpire through sheer ecstasy at escaping from their prolonged washing.\"\n\n\"I have seen them doing it myself,\" said Meehawl. \"Did you ever hear,\nsir, about the fish that Paudeen MacLoughlin caught in the policeman's\nhat.\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said the Philosopher. \"The first person who washed was\npossibly a person seeking a cheap notoriety. Any fool can wash himself,\nbut every wise man knows that it is an unnecessary labour, for nature\nwill quickly reduce him to a natural and healthy dirtiness again. We\nshould seek, therefore, not how to make ourselves clean, but how to\nattain a more unique and splendid dirtiness, and perhaps the accumulated\nlayers of matter might, by ordinary geologic compulsion, become\nincorporated with the human cuticle and so render clothing\nunnecessary--\"\n\n\"About that washboard,\" said Meehawl, \"I was just going to say--\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said the Philosopher. \"In its proper place I admit\nthe necessity for water. As a thing to sail a ship on it can scarcely be\nsurpassed (not, you will understand, that I entirely approve of ships,\nthey tend to create and perpetuate international curiosity and the\nsmaller vermin of different latitudes). As an element wherewith to put\nout a fire, or brew tea, or make a slide in winter it is useful, but in\na tin basin it has a repulsive and meagre aspect.--Now as to your wife's\nwashboard--\"\n\n\"Good luck to your honour,\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"Your wife says that either the fairies or a woman with a goat's leg has\nit.\"\n\n\"It's her whiskers,\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"They are lame,\" said the Philosopher sternly.\n\n\"Have it your own way, sir, I'm not certain now how the creature is\nafflicted.\"\n\n\"You say that this unhealthy woman has not got your wife's washboard. It\nremains, therefore, that the fairies have it.\"\n\n\"It looks that way,\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"There are six clans of fairies living in this neighbourhood; but the\nprocess of elimination, which has shaped the world to a globe, the ant\nto its environment, and man to the captaincy of the vertebrates, will\nnot fail in this instance either.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see anything like the way wasps have increased this\nseason?\" said Meehawl; \"faith, you can't sit down anywhere but your\nbreeches--\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Did you leave out a pan of milk on\nlast Tuesday?\"\n\n\"I did then.\"\n\n\"Do you take off your hat when you meet a dust twirl?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't neglect that,\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"Did you cut down a thorn bush recently?\"\n\n\"I'd sooner cut my eye out,\" said Meehawl, \"and go about as wall-eyed\nas Lorcan O'Nualain's ass: I would that. Did you ever see his ass, sir?\nIt--\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Did you kill a robin redbreast?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Meehawl. \"By the pipers,\" he added, \"that old skinny cat\nof mine caught a bird on the roof yesterday.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" cried the Philosopher, moving, if it were possible, even closer\nto his client, \"now we have it. It is the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca\nMora took your washboard. Go to the Gort at once. There is a hole under\na tree in the south-east of the field. Try what you will find in that\nhole.\"\n\n\"I'll do that,\" said Meehawl. \"Did you ever-\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said the Philosopher.\n\nSo Meehawl MacMurrachu went away and did as he had been bidden, and\nunderneath the tree of Gort na Cloca Mora he found a little crock of\ngold.\n\n\"There's a power of washboards in that,\" said he.\n\nBy reason of this incident the fame of the Philosopher became even\ngreater than it had been before, and also by reason of it many singular\nevents were to happen with which you shall duly become acquainted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIT SO happened that the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca Mora were not\nthankful to the Philosopher for having sent Meehawl MacMurrachu to\ntheir field. In stealing Meehawl's property they were quite within their\nrights because their bird had undoubtedly been slain by his cat. Not\nalone, therefore, was their righteous vengeance nullified, but the crock\nof gold which had taken their community many thousands of years to amass\nwas stolen. A Leprecaun without a pot of gold is like a rose without\nperfume, a bird without a wing, or an inside without an outside. They\nconsidered that the Philosopher had treated them badly, that his action\nwas mischievous and unneighbourly, and that until they were adequately\ncompensated for their loss both of treasure and dignity, no conditions\nother than those of enmity could exist between their people and the\nlittle house in the pine wood. Furthermore, for them the situation was\ncruelly complicated. They were unable to organise a direct, personal\nhostility against their new enemy, because the Thin Woman of Inis\nMagrath would certainly protect her husband. She belonged to the Shee of\nCroghan Conghaile, who had relatives in every fairy fort in Ireland, and\nwere also strongly represented in the forts and duns of their immediate\nneighbours. They could, of course, have called an extraordinary meeting\nof the Sheogs, Leprecauns, and Cluricauns, and presented their case\nwith a claim for damages against the Shee of Croghan Conghaile, but\nthat Clann would assuredly repudiate any liability on the ground that\nno member of their fraternity was responsible for the outrage, as it was\nthe Philosopher, and not the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, who had done\nthe deed. Notwithstanding this they were unwilling to let the matter\nrest, and the fact that justice was out of reach only added fury to\ntheir anger.\n\nOne of their number was sent to interview the Thin Woman of Inis\nMagrath, and the others concentrated nightly about the dwelling of\nMeehawl MacMurrachu in an endeavour to recapture the treasure which\nthey were quite satisfied was hopeless. They found that Meehawl, who\nunderstood the customs of the Earth Folk very well, had buried the crock\nof gold beneath a thorn bush, thereby placing it under the protection of\nevery fairy in the world--the Leprecauns themselves included, and until\nit was removed from this place by human hands they were bound to respect\nits hiding-place, and even guarantee its safety with their blood.\n\nThey afflicted Meehawl with an extraordinary attack of rheumatism and\nhis wife with an equally virulent sciatica, but they got no lasting\npleasure from their groans.\n\nThe Leprecaun, who had been detailed to visit the Thin Woman of Inis\nMagrath, duly arrived at the cottage in the pine wood and made his\ncomplaint. The little man wept as he told the story, and the two\nchildren wept out of sympathy for him. The Thin Woman said she was\ndesperately grieved by the whole unpleasant transaction, and that\nall her sympathies were with Gort na Cloca Mora, but that she must\ndisassociate herself from any responsibility in the matter as it was her\nhusband who was the culpable person, and that she had no control over\nhis mental processes, which, she concluded, was one of the seven curious\nthings in the world.\n\nAs her husband was away in a distant part of the wood nothing further\ncould be done at that time, so the Leprecaun returned again to his\nfellows without any good news, but he promised to come back early on the\nfollowing day. When the Philosopher come home late that night the Thin\nWoman was waiting up for him.\n\n\"Woman,\" said the Philosopher, \"you ought to be in bed.\"\n\n\"Ought I indeed?\" said the Thin Woman. \"I'd have you know that I'll go\nto bed when I like and get up when I like without asking your or any one\nelse's permission.\"\n\n\"That is not true,\" said the Philosopher. \"You get sleepy whether you\nlike it or not, and you awaken again without your permission being\nasked. Like many other customs such as singing, dancing, music, and\nacting, sleep has crept into popular favour as part of a religious\nceremonial. Nowhere can one go to sleep more easily than in a church.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said the Thin Woman, \"that a Leprecaun came here to-day?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said the Philosopher, \"and notwithstanding the innumerable\ncenturies which have elapsed since that first sleeper (probably with\nextreme difficulty) sank into his religious trance, we can to-day sleep\nthrough a religious ceremony with an ease which would have been a source\nof wealth and fame to that prehistoric worshipper and his acolytes.\"\n\n\"Are you going to listen to what I am telling you about the Leprecaun?\"\nsaid the Thin Woman.\n\n\"I am not,\" said the Philosopher. \"It has been suggested that we go\nto sleep at night because it is then too dark to do anything else; but\nowls, who are a venerably sagacious folk, do not sleep in the night\ntime. Bats, also, are a very clear-minded race; they sleep in the\nbroadest day, and they do it in a charming manner. They clutch the\nbranch of a tree with their toes and hang head downwards--a position\nwhich I consider singularly happy, for the rush of blood to the head\nconsequent on this inverted position should engender a drowsiness and a\ncertain imbecility of mind which must either sleep or explode.\"\n\n\"Will you never be done talking?\" shouted the Thin Woman passionately.\n\n\"I will not,\" said the Philosopher. \"In certain ways sleep is useful.\nIt is an excellent way of listening to an opera or seeing pictures on\na bioscope. As a medium for day-dreams I know of nothing that can equal\nit. As an accomplishment it is graceful, but as a means of spending a\nnight it is intolerably ridiculous. If you were going to say anything,\nmy love, please say it now, but you should always remember to think\nbefore you speak. A woman should be seen seldom but never heard.\nQuietness is the beginning of virtue. To be silent is to be beautiful.\nStars do not make a noise. Children should always be in bed. These are\nserious truths, which cannot be controverted; therefore, silence is\nfitting as regards them.\"\n\n\"Your stirabout is on the hob,\" said the Thin Woman. \"You can get it for\nyourself. I would not move the breadth of my nail if you were dying of\nhunger. I hope there's lumps in it. A Leprecaun from Gort na Cloca Mora\nwas here to-day. They'll give it to you for robbing their pot of gold.\nYou old thief, you! you lobeared, crock-kneed fat-eye!\"\n\nThe Thin Woman whizzed suddenly from where she stood and leaped into\nbed. From beneath the blanket she turned a vivid, furious eye on her\nhusband. She was trying to give him rheumatism and toothache and lockjaw\nall at once. If she had been satisfied to concentrate her attention on\none only of these torments she might have succeeded in afflicting her\nhusband according to her wish, but she was not able to do that.\n\n\"Finality is death. Perfection is finality. Nothing is perfect. There\nare lumps in it,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWHEN the Leprecaun came through the pine wood on the following day he\nmet two children at a little distance from the house. He raised his open\nright hand above his head (this is both the fairy and the Gaelic form of\nsalutation), and would have passed on but that a thought brought him\nto a halt. Sitting down before the two children he stared at them for a\nlong time, and they stared back at him. At last he said to the boy:\n\n\"What is your name, a vic vig O?\"\n\n\"Seumas Beg, sir,\" the boy replied.\n\n\"It's a little name,\" said the Leprecaun.\n\n\"It's what my mother calls me, sir,\" returned the boy.\n\n\"What does your father call you,\" was the next question.\n\n\"Seumas Roghan Maelduin O'Carbhail Mac an Droid.\"\n\n\"It's a big name,\" said the Leprecaun, and he turned to the little girl.\n\"What is your name, a cailin vig O?\"\n\n\"Brigid Beg, sir.\"\n\n\"And what does your father call you?\"\n\n\"He never calls me at all, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, Seumaseen and Breedeen, you are good little children, and I like\nyou very much. Health be with you until I come to see you again.\"\n\nAnd then the Leprecaun went back the way he had come. As he went he made\nlittle jumps and cracked his fingers, and sometimes he rubbed one leg\nagainst the other.\n\n\"That's a nice Leprecaun,\" said Seumas.\n\n\"I like him too,\" said Brigid.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Seumas, \"let me be the Leprecaun, and you be the two\nchildren, and I will ask you our names.\"\n\nSo they did that.\n\nThe next day the Leprecaun came again. He sat down beside the children\nand, as before, he was silent for a little time.\n\n\"Are you not going to ask us our names, sir?\" said Seumas.\n\nHis sister smoothed out her dress shyly. \"My name, sir, is Brigid Beg,\"\nsaid she.\n\n\"Did you ever play Jackstones?\" said the Leprecaun.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Seumas.\n\n\"I'll teach you how to play Jackstones,\" said the Leprecaun, and he\npicked up some pine cones and taught the children that game.\n\n\"Did you ever play Ball in the Decker?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Seumas.\n\n\"Did you ever play 'I can make a nail with my ree-roraddy-O, I can make\na nail with my ree-ro-ray'?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Seumas.\n\n\"It's a nice game,\" said the Leprecaun, \"and so is Capon-the-back, and\nTwenty-four yards on the Billy-goat's Tail, and Towns, and Relievo, and\nLeap-frog. I'll teach you all these games,\" said the Leprecaun, \"and\nI'll teach you how to play Knifey, and Hole-and-taw, and Horneys and\nRobbers.\n\n\"Leap-frog is the best one to start with, so I'll teach it to you at\nonce. Let you bend down like this, Breedeen, and you bend down like that\na good distance away, Seumas. Now I jump over Breedeen's back, and then\nI run and jump over Seumaseen's back like this, and then I run ahead\nagain and I bend down. Now, Breedeen, you jump over your brother, and\nthen you jump over me, and run a good bit on and bend down again. Now,\nSeumas, it's your turn; you jump over me and then over your sister, and\nthen you run on and bend down again and I jump.\"\n\n\"This is a fine game, sir,\" said Seumas.\n\n\"It is, a vic vig,--keep in your head,\" said the Leprecaun. \"That's a\ngood jump, you couldn't beat that jump, Seumas.\"\n\n\"I can jump better than Brigid already,\" replied Seumas, \"and I'll jump\nas well as you do when I get more practice--keep in your head, sir.\"\n\nAlmost without noticing it they had passed through the edge of the wood,\nand were playing into a rough field which was cumbered with big, grey\nrocks. It was the very last field in sight, and behind it the rough,\nheather-packed mountain sloped distantly away to the skyline. There was\na raggedy blackberry hedge all round the field, and there were long,\ntough, haggard-looking plants growing in clumps here and there. Near\na corner of this field there was a broad, low tree, and as they played\nthey came near and nearer to it. The Leprecaun gave a back very close to\nthe tree. Seumas ran and jumped and slid down a hole at the side of the\ntree. Then Brigid ran and jumped and slid down the same hole.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Brigid, and she flashed out of sight.\n\nThe Leprecaun cracked his fingers and rubbed one leg against the other,\nand then he also dived into the hole and disappeared from view.\n\nWhen the time at which the children usually went home had passed, the\nThin Woman of Inis Magrath became a little anxious. She had never known\nthem to be late for dinner before. There was one of the children whom\nshe hated; it was her own child, but as she had forgotten which of them\nwas hers, and as she loved one of them, she was compelled to love both\nfor fear of making a mistake and chastising the child for whom her heart\nsecretly yearned. Therefore, she was equally concerned about both of\nthem.\n\nDinner time passed and supper time arrived, but the children did not.\nAgain and again the Thin Woman went out through the dark pine trees and\ncalled until she was so hoarse that she could not even hear herself when\nshe roared. The evening wore on to the night, and while she waited for\nthe Philosopher to come in she reviewed the situation. Her husband had\nnot come in, the children had not come in, the Leprecaun had not returned\nas arranged.... A light flashed upon her. The Leprecaun had kidnapped\nher children! She announced a vengeance against the Leprecauns which\nwould stagger humanity. While in the extreme centre of her ecstasy the\nPhilosopher came through the trees and entered the house.\n\nThe Thin Woman flew to him-\"Husband,\" said she, \"the Leprecauns of Gort\nna Cloca Mora have kidnapped our children.\"\n\nThe Philosopher gazed at her for a moment.\n\n\"Kidnapping,\" said he, \"has been for many centuries a favourite\noccupation of fairies, gypsies, and the brigands of the East. The usual\nprocedure is to attach a person and hold it to ransom. If the ransom is\nnot paid an ear or a finger may be cut from the captive and despatched\nto those interested, with the statement that an arm or a leg will follow\nin a week unless suitable arrangements are entered into.\"\n\n\"Do you understand,\" said the Thin Woman passionately, \"that it is your\nown children who have been kidnapped?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said the Philosopher. \"This course, however, is rarely\nfollowed by the fairy people: they do not ordinarily steal for ransom,\nbut for love of thieving, or from some other obscure and possibly\nfunctional causes, and the victim is retained in their forts or duns\nuntil by the effluxion of time they forget their origin and become\npeaceable citizens of the fairy state. Kidnapping is not by any means\nconfined to either humanity or the fairy people.\"\n\n\"Monster,\" said the Thin Woman in a deep voice, \"will you listen to me?\"\n\n\"I will not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Many of the insectivora also\npractice this custom. Ants, for example, are a respectable race living\nin well-ordered communities. They have attained to a most complex and\nartificial civilization, and will frequently adventure far afield on\ncolonising or other expeditions from whence they return with a rich\nbooty of aphides and other stock, who thenceforward become the servants\nand domestic creatures of the republic. As they neither kill nor eat\ntheir captives, this practice will be termed kidnapping. The same may\nbe said of bees, a hardy and industrious race living in hexagonal cells\nwhich are very difficult to make. Sometimes, on lacking a queen of\ntheir own, they have been observed to abduct one from a less powerful\nneighbour, and use her for their own purposes without shame, mercy, or\nremorse.\"\n\n\"Will you not understand?\" screamed the Thin Woman.\n\n\"I will not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Semi-tropical apes have been\nrumoured to kidnap children, and are reported to use them very tenderly\nindeed, sharing their coconuts, yams, plantains, and other equatorial\nprovender with the largest generosity, and conveying their delicate\ncaptives from tree to tree (often at great distances from each other and\nfrom the ground) with the most guarded solicitude and benevolence.\"\n\n\"I am going to bed,\" said the Thin Woman, \"your stirabout is on the\nhob.\"\n\n\"Are there lumps in it, my dear?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I hope there are,\" replied the Thin Woman, and she leaped into bed.\n\nThat night the Philosopher was afflicted with the most extraordinary\nattack of rheumatism he had ever known, nor did he get any ease until\nthe grey morning wearied his lady into a reluctant slumber.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE Thin Woman of Inis Magrath slept very late that morning, but when\nshe did awaken her impatience was so urgent that she could scarcely\ndelay to eat her breakfast. Immediately after she had eaten she put on\nher bonnet and shawl and went through the pine wood in the direction of\nGort na Cloca Mora. In a short time she reached the rocky field, and,\nwalking over to the tree in the southeast corner, she picked up a small\nstone and hammered loudly against the trunk of the tree. She hammered\nin a peculiar fashion, giving two knocks and then three knocks, and then\none knock. A voice came up from the hole.\n\n\"Who is that, please?\" said the voice.\n\n\"Ban na Droid of Inis Magrath, and well you know it,\" was her reply.\n\n\"I am coming up, Noble Woman,\" said the voice, and in another moment the\nLeprecaun leaped out of the hole.\n\n\"Where are Seumas and Brigid Beg?\" said the Thin Woman sternly.\n\n\"How would I know where they are?\" replied the Leprecaun. \"Wouldn't they\nbe at home now?\"\n\n\"If they were at home I wouldn't have come here looking for them,\" was\nher reply. \"It is my belief that you have them.\"\n\n\"Search me,\" said the Leprecaun, opening his waistcoat.\n\n\"They are down there in your little house,\" said the Thin Woman angrily,\n\"and the sooner you let them up the better it will be for yourself and\nyour five brothers.\"\n\n\"Noble Woman,\" said the Leprecaun, \"you can go down yourself into our\nlittle house and look. I can't say fairer than that.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't fit down there,\" said she. \"I'm too big.\"\n\n\"You know the way for making yourself little,\" replied the Leprecaun.\n\n\"But I mightn't be able to make myself big again,\" said the Thin Woman,\n\"and then you and your dirty brothers would have it all your own way. If\nyou don't let the children up,\" she continued, \"I'll raise the Shee of\nCroghan Conghaile against you. You know what happened to the Cluricauns\nof Oilean na Glas when they stole the Queen's baby--It will be a worse\nthing than that for you. If the children are not back in my house before\nmoonrise this night, I'll go round to my people. Just tell that to your\nfive ugly brothers. Health with you,\" she added, and strode away.\n\n\"Health with yourself, Noble Woman,\" said the Leprecaun, and he stood on\none leg until she was out of sight and then he slid down into the hole\nagain.\n\nWhen the Thin Woman was going back through the pine wood she saw Meehawl\nMacMurrachu travelling in the same direction and his brows were in a\ntangle of perplexity.\n\n\"God be with you, Meehawl MacMurrachu,\" said she.\n\n\"God and Mary be with you, ma'am,\" he replied, \"I am in great trouble\nthis day.\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't you be?\" said the Thin Woman.\n\n\"I came up to have a talk with your husband about a particular thing.\"\n\n\"If it's talk you want you have come to a good house, Meehawl.\"\n\n\"He's a powerful man right enough,\" said Meehawl.\n\nAfter a few minutes the Thin Woman spoke again. \"I can get the reek of\nhis pipe from here. Let you go right in to him now and I'll stay outside\nfor a while, for the sound of your two voices would give me a pain in my\nhead.\"\n\n\"Whatever will please you will please me, ma'am,\" said her companion,\nand he went into the little house.\n\nMeehawl MacMurrachu had good reason to be perplexed. He was the father\nof one child only, and she was the most beautiful girl in the whole\nworld. The pity of it was that no one at all knew she was beautiful, and\nshe did not even know it herself. At times when she bathed in the eddy\nof a mountain stream and saw her reflection looking up from the placid\nwater she thought that she looked very nice, and then a great sadness\nwould come upon her, for what is the use of looking nice if there is\nnobody to see one's beauty? Beauty, also, is usefulness. The arts as\nwell as the crafts, the graces equally with the utilities must stand up\nin the marketplace and be judged by the gombeen men.\n\nThe only house near to her father's was that occupied by Bessie\nHannigan. The other few houses were scattered widely with long, quiet\nmiles of hill and bog between them, so that she had hardly seen more\nthan a couple of men beside her father since she was born. She helped\nher father and mother in all the small businesses of their house, and\nevery day also she drove their three cows and two goats to pasture on\nthe mountain slopes. Here through the sunny days the years had passed\nin a slow, warm thoughtlessness wherein, without thinking, many thoughts\nhad entered into her mind and many pictures hung for a moment like\nbirds in the thin air. At first, and for a long time, she had been happy\nenough; there were many things in which a child might be interested:\nthe spacious heavens which never wore the same beauty on any day; the\ninnumerable little creatures living among the grasses or in the heather;\nthe steep swing of a bird down from the mountain to the infinite plains\nbelow; the little flowers which were so contented each in its peaceful\nplace; the bees gathering food for their houses, and the stout beetles\nwho are always losing their way in the dusk. These things, and many\nothers, interested her. The three cows after they had grazed for a long\ntime would come and lie by her side and look at her as they chewed their\ncud, and the goats would prance from the bracken to push their heads\nagainst her breast because they loved her.\n\nIndeed, everything in her quiet world loved this girl: but very slowly\nthere was growing in her consciousness an unrest, a disquietude to\nwhich she had hitherto been a stranger. Sometimes an infinite weariness\noppressed her to the earth. A thought was born in her mind and it had\nno name. It was growing and could not be expressed. She had no words\nwherewith to meet it, to exorcise or greet this stranger who, more and\nmore insistently and pleadingly, tapped upon her doors and begged to\nbe spoken to, admitted and caressed and nourished. A thought is a real\nthing and words are only its raiment, but a thought is as shy as a\nvirgin; unless it is fittingly apparelled we may not look on its shadowy\nnakedness: it will fly from us and only return again in the darkness\ncrying in a thin, childish voice which we may not comprehend until, with\naching minds, listening and divining, we at last fashion for it those\nsymbols which are its protection and its banner. So she could not\nunderstand the touch that came to her from afar and yet how intimately,\nthe whisper so aloof and yet so thrillingly personal. The standard of\neither language or experience was not hers; she could listen but not\nthink, she could feel but not know, her eyes looked forward and did not\nsee, her hands groped in the sunlight and felt nothing. It was like the\nedge of a little wind which stirred her tresses but could not lift them,\nor the first white peep of the dawn which is neither light nor darkness.\nBut she listened, not with her ears but with her blood. The fingers of\nher soul stretched out to clasp a stranger's hand, and her disquietude\nwas quickened through with an eagerness which was neither physical nor\nmental, for neither her body nor her mind was definitely interested.\nSome dim region between these grew alarmed and watched and waited and\ndid not sleep or grow weary at all.\n\nOne morning she lay among the long, warm grasses. She watched a bird who\nsoared and sang for a little time, and then it sped swiftly away down\nthe steep air and out of sight in the blue distance. Even when it was\ngone the song seemed to ring in her ears. It seemed to linger with her\nas a faint, sweet echo, coming fitfully, with little pauses as though a\nwind disturbed it, and careless, distant eddies. After a few moments she\nknew it was not a bird. No bird's song had that consecutive melody, for\ntheir themes are as careless as their wings. She sat up and looked about\nher, but there was nothing in sight: the mountains sloped gently above\nher and away to the clear sky; around her the scattered clumps of\nheather were drowsing in the sunlight; far below she could see her\nfather's house, a little grey patch near some trees-and then the music\nstopped and left her wondering.\n\nShe could not find her goats anywhere although for a long time she\nsearched. They came to her at last of their own accord from behind a\nfold in the hills, and they were more wildly excited than she had ever\nseen them before. Even the cows forsook their solemnity and broke into\nawkward gambols around her. As she walked home that evening a strange\nelation taught her feet to dance. Hither and thither she flitted in\nfront of the beasts and behind them. Her feet tripped to a wayward\nmeasure. There was a tune in her ears and she danced to it, throwing\nher arms out and above her head and swaying and bending as she went.\nThe full freedom of her body was hers now: the lightness and poise and\ncertainty of her limbs delighted her, and the strength that did not\ntire delighted her also. The evening was full of peace and quietude, the\nmellow, dusky sunlight made a path for her feet, and everywhere through\nthe wide fields birds were flashing and singing, and she sang with them\na song that had no words and wanted none.\n\nThe following day she heard the music again, faint and thin, wonderfully\nsweet and as wild as the song of a bird, but it was a melody which\nno bird would adhere to. A theme was repeated again and again. In the\nmiddle of trills, grace-notes, runs and catches it recurred with a\nstrange, almost holy, solemnity,--a hushing, slender melody full of\nausterity and aloofness. There was something in it to set her heart\nbeating. She yearned to it with her ears and her lips. Was it joy,\nmenace, carelessness? She did not know, but this she did know, that\nhowever terrible it was personal to her. It was her unborn thought\nstrangely audible and felt rather than understood.\n\nOn that day she did not see anybody either. She drove her charges home\nin the evening listlessly and the beasts also were very quiet.\n\nWhen the music came again she made no effort to discover where it came\nfrom. She only listened, and when the tune was ended she saw a figure\nrise from the fold of a little hill. The sunlight was gleaming from his\narms and shoulders but the rest of his body was hidden by the bracken,\nand he did not look at her as he went away playing softly on a double\npipe.\n\nThe next day he did look at her. He stood waist-deep in greenery\nfronting her squarely. She had never seen so strange a face before. Her\neyes almost died on him as she gazed and he returned her look for a long\nminute with an intent, expressionless regard. His hair was a cluster of\nbrown curls, his nose was little and straight, and his wide mouth\ndrooped sadly at the corners. His eyes were wide and most mournful, and\nhis forehead was very broad and white. His sad eyes and mouth almost\nmade her weep.\n\nWhen he turned away he smiled at her, and it was as though the sun had\nshone suddenly in a dark place, banishing all sadness and gloom. Then he\nwent mincingly away. As he went he lifted the slender double reed to his\nlips and blew a few careless notes.\n\nThe next day he fronted her as before, looking down to her eyes from a\nshort distance. He played for only a few moments, and fitfully, and then\nhe came to her. When he left the bracken the girl suddenly clapped\nher hands against her eyes affrighted. There was something different,\nterrible about him. The upper part of his body was beautiful, but the\nlower part.... She dared not look at him again. She would have risen and\nfled away but she feared he might pursue her, and the thought of such\na chase and the inevitable capture froze her blood. The thought of\nanything behind us is always terrible. The sound of pursuing feet is\nworse than the murder from which we fly--So she sat still and waited but\nnothing happened. At last, desperately, she dropped her hands. He was\nsitting on the ground a few paces from her. He was not looking at her\nbut far away sidewards across the spreading hill. His legs were crossed;\nthey were shaggy and hoofed like the legs of a goat: but she would not\nlook at these because of his wonderful, sad, grotesque face. Gaiety is\ngood to look upon and an innocent face is delightful to our souls,\nbut no woman can resist sadness or weakness, and ugliness she dare\nnot resist. Her nature leaps to be the comforter. It is her reason. It\nexalts her to an ecstasy wherein nothing but the sacrifice of herself\nhas any proportion. Men are not fathers by instinct but by chance, but\nwomen are mothers beyond thought, beyond instinct which is the father\nof thought. Motherliness, pity, self-sacrifice--these are the charges\nof her primal cell, and not even the discovery that men are comedians,\nliars, and egotists will wean her from this. As she looked at the pathos\nof his face she repudiated the hideousness of his body. The beast\nwhich is in all men is glossed by women; it is his childishness, the\ndestructive energy inseparable from youth and high spirits, and it is\nalways forgiven by women, often forgotten, sometimes, and not rarely,\ncherished and fostered.\n\nAfter a few moments of this silence he placed the reed to his lips and\nplayed a plaintive little air, and then he spoke to her in a strange\nvoice, coming like a wind from distant places.\n\n\"What is your name, Shepherd Girl?\" said he.\n\n\"Caitilin, Ingin Ni Murrachu,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Daughter of Murrachu,\" said he, \"I have come from a far place where\nthere are high hills. The men and maidens who follow their flocks in\nthat place know me and love me for I am the Master of the Shepherds.\nThey sing and dance and are glad when I come to them in the sunlight;\nbut in this country no people have done any reverence to me. The\nshepherds fly away when they hear my pipes in the pastures; the maidens\nscream in fear when I dance to them in the meadows. I am very lonely in\nthis strange country. You also, although you danced to the music of my\npipes, have covered your face against me and made no reverence.\"\n\n\"I will do whatever you say if it is right,\" said she.\n\n\"You must not do anything because it is right, but because it is your\nwish. Right is a word and Wrong is a word, but the sun shines in the\nmorning and the dew falls in the dusk without thinking of these words\nwhich have no meaning. The bee flies to the flower and the seed goes\nabroad and is happy. Is that right, Shepherd Girl?--it is wrong also.\nI come to you because the bee goes to the flower--it is wrong! If I did\nnot come to you to whom would I go? There is no right and no wrong but\nonly the will of the gods.\"\n\n\"I am afraid of you,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You fear me because my legs are shaggy like the legs of a goat. Look at\nthem well, O Maiden, and know that they are indeed the legs of a beast\nand then you will not be afraid any more. Do you not love beasts? Surely\nyou should love them for they yearn to you humbly or fiercely, craving\nyour hand upon their heads as I do. If I were not fashioned thus I would\nnot come to you because I would not need you. Man is a god and a brute.\nHe aspires to the stars with his head but his feet are contented in\nthe grasses of the field, and when he forsakes the brute upon which he\nstands then there will be no more men and no more women and the immortal\ngods will blow this world away like smoke.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you want me to do,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I want you to want me. I want you to forget right and wrong; to be as\nhappy as the beasts, as careless as the flowers and the birds. To live\nto the depths of your nature as well as to the heights. Truly there are\nstars in the heights and they will be a garland for your forehead. But\nthe depths are equal to the heights. Wondrous deep are the depths, very\nfertile is the lowest deep. There are stars there also, brighter than\nthe stars on high. The name of the heights is Wisdom and the name of the\ndepths is Love. How shall they come together and be fruitful if you do\nnot plunge deeply and fearlessly? Wisdom is the spirit and the wings of\nthe spirit, Love is the shaggy beast that goes down. Gallantly he dives,\nbelow thought, beyond Wisdom, to rise again as high above these as he\nhad first descended. Wisdom is righteous and clean, but Love is unclean\nand holy. I sing of the beast and the descent: the great unclean purging\nitself in fire: the thought that is not born in the measure or the ice\nor the head, but in the feet and the hot blood and the pulse of fury.\nThe Crown of Life is not lodged in the sun: the wise gods have buried it\ndeeply where the thoughtful will not find it, nor the good: but the Gay\nOnes, the Adventurous Ones, the Careless Plungers, they will bring it to\nthe wise and astonish them. All things are seen in the light--How shall\nwe value that which is easy to see? But the precious things which\nare hidden, they will be more precious for our search: they will be\nbeautiful with our sorrow: they will be noble because of our desire for\nthem. Come away with me, Shepherd Girl, through the fields, and we will\nbe careless and happy, and we will leave thought to find us when it can,\nfor that is the duty of thought, and it is more anxious to discover us\nthan we are to be found.\"\n\nSo Caitilin Ni Murrachu arose and went with him through the fields, and\nshe did not go with him because of love, nor because his words had been\nunderstood by her, but only because he was naked and unashamed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIT was on account of his daughter that Meehawl MacMurrachu had come to\nvisit the Philosopher. He did not know what had become of her, and the\nfacts he had to lay before his adviser were very few.\n\nHe left the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath taking snuff under a pine tree\nand went into the house.\n\n\"God be with all here,\" said he as he entered.\n\n\"God be with yourself, Meehawl MacMurrachu,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I am in great trouble this day, sir,\" said Meehawl, \"and if you would\ngive me an advice I'd be greatly beholden to you.\"\n\n\"I can give you that,\" replied the Philosopher.\n\n\"None better than your honour and no trouble to you either. It was a\npowerful advice you gave me about the washboard, and if I didn't come\nhere to thank you before this it was not because I didn't want to come,\nbut that I couldn't move hand or foot by dint of the cruel rheumatism\nput upon me by the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca Mora, bad cess to them\nfor ever: twisted I was the way you'd get a squint in your eye if you\nonly looked at me, and the pain I suffered would astonish you.\"\n\n\"It would not,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"No matter,\" said Meehawl. \"What I came about was my young daughter\nCaitilin. Sight or light of her I haven't had for three days. My wife\nsaid first, that it was the fairies had taken her, and then she said it\nwas a travelling man that had a musical instrument she went away with,\nand after that she said, that maybe the girl was lying dead in the butt\nof a ditch with her eyes wide open, and she staring broadly at the\nmoon in the night time and the sun in the day until the crows would be\nfinding her out.\"\n\nThe Philosopher drew his chair closer to Meehawl.\n\n\"Daughters,\" said he, \"have been a cause of anxiety to their parents\never since they were instituted. The flightiness of the female\ntemperament is very evident in those who have not arrived at the\nyears which teach how to hide faults and frailties, and, therefore,\nindiscretions bristle from a young girl the way branches do from a\nbush.\"\n\n\"The person who would deny that--\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"Female children, however, have the particular sanction of nature. They\nare produced in astonishing excess over males, and may, accordingly,\nbe admitted as dominant to the male; but the well-proven law that the\nminority shall always control the majority will relieve our minds from a\nfear which might otherwise become intolerable.\"\n\n\"It's true enough,\" said Meehawl. \"Have you noticed, sir, that in a\nlitter of pups--\"\n\n\"I have not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Certain trades and professions,\nit is curious to note, tend to be perpetuated in the female line. The\nsovereign profession among bees and ants is always female, and publicans\nalso descend on the distaff side. You will have noticed that every\npublican has three daughters of extraordinary charms. Lacking these\nsigns we would do well to look askance at such a man's liquor, divining\nthat in his brew there will be an undue percentage of water, for if his\nprimogeniture is infected how shall his honesty escape?\"\n\n\"It would take a wise head to answer that,\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"It would not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Throughout nature the female\ntends to polygamy.\"\n\n\"If,\" said Meehawl, \"that unfortunate daughter of mine is lying dead in\na ditch--\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said the Philosopher. \"Many races have endeavoured\nto place some limits to this increase in females. Certain Oriental\npeoples have conferred the titles of divinity on crocodiles, serpents,\nand tigers of the jungle, and have fed these with their surplusage\nof daughters. In China, likewise, such sacrifices are defended as\nhonourable and economic practices. But, broadly speaking, if daughters\nhave to be curtailed I prefer your method of losing them rather than the\nreligio-hysterical compromises of the Orient.\"\n\n\"I give you my word, sir,\" said Meehawl, \"that I don't know what you are\ntalking about at all.\"\n\n\"That,\" said the Philosopher, \"may be accounted for in three\nways--firstly, there is a lack of cerebral continuity: that is, faulty\nattention; secondly, it might be due to a local peculiarity in the\nconformation of the skull, or, perhaps, a superficial instead of a deep\nindenting of the cerebral coil; and thirdly--\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear,\" said Meehawl, \"of the man that had the scalp of his\nhead blown off by a gun, and they soldered the bottom of a tin dish to\nthe top of his skull the way you could hear his brains ticking inside of\nit for all the world like a Waterbury watch?\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Thirdly, it may--\"\n\n\"It's my daughter, Caitilin, sir,\" said Meehawl humbly. \"Maybe she is\nlying in the butt of a ditch and the crows picking her eyes out.\"\n\n\"What did she die of?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"My wife only put it that maybe she was dead, and that maybe she was\ntaken by the fairies, and that maybe she went away with the travelling\nman that had the musical instrument. She said it was a concertina, but I\nthink myself it was a flute he had.\"\n\n\"Who was this traveller?\"\n\n\"I never saw him,\" said Meehawl, \"but one day I went a few perches up\nthe hill and I heard him playing--thin, squeaky music it was like you'd\nbe blowing out of a tin whistle. I looked about for him everywhere, but\nnot a bit of him could I see.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I looked about--\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"I know,\" said the Philosopher. \"Did you happen to look at your goats?\"\n\n\"I couldn't well help doing that,\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"What were they doing?\" said the Philosopher eagerly.\n\n\"They were bucking each other across the field, and standing on their\nhind legs and cutting such capers that I laughed till I had a pain in my\nstomach at the gait of them.\"\n\n\"This is very interesting,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Do you tell me so?\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"I do,\" said the Philosopher, \"and for this reason-most of the races of\nthe world have at one time or another--\"\n\n\"It's my little daughter, Caitilin, sir,\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"I'm attending to her,\" the Philosopher replied.\n\n\"I thank you kindly,\" returned Meehawl.\n\nThe Philosopher continued \"Most of the races of the world have at one\ntime or another been visited by this deity, whose title is the 'Great\nGod Pan,' but there is no record of his ever having journeyed to\nIreland, and, certainly within historic times, he has not set foot on\nthese shores. He lived for a great number of years in Egypt, Persia,\nand Greece, and although his empire is supposed to be world-wide, this\nuniversal sway has always been, and always will be, contested; but\nnevertheless, however sharply his empire may be curtailed, he will never\nbe without a kingdom wherein his exercise of sovereign rights will be\ngladly and passionately acclaimed.\"\n\n\"Is he one of the old gods, sir?\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"He is,\" replied the Philosopher, \"and his coming intends no good\nto this country. Have you any idea why he should have captured your\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"Not an idea in the world.\"\n\n\"Is your daughter beautiful?\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you, because I never thought of looking at her that\nway. But she is a good milker, and as strong as a man. She can lift a\nbag of meal under her arm easier than I can; but she's a timid creature\nfor all that.\"\n\n\"Whatever the reason is I am certain that he has the girl, and I am\ninclined to think that he was directed to her by the Leprecauns of\nthe Gort. You know they are at feud with you ever since their bird was\nkilled?\"\n\n\"I am not likely to forget it, and they racking me day and night with\ntorments.\"\n\n\"You may be sure,\" said the Philosopher, \"that if he's anywhere at all\nit's at Gort na Cloca Mora he is, for, being a stranger, he wouldn't\nknow where to go unless he was directed, and they know every hole and\ncorner of this countryside since ancient times. I'd go up myself and\nhave a talk with him, but it wouldn't be a bit of good, and it wouldn't\nbe any use your going either. He has power over all grown people so that\nthey either go and get drunk or else they fall in love with every person\nthey meet, and commit assaults and things I wouldn't like to be telling\nyou about. The only folk who can go near him at all are little children,\nbecause he has no power over them until they grow to the sensual age,\nand then he exercises lordship over them as over every one else. I'll\nsend my two children with a message to him to say that he isn't doing\nthe decent thing, and that if he doesn't let the girl alone and go back\nto his own country we'll send for Angus Og.\"\n\n\"He'd make short work of him, I'm thinking.\"\n\n\"He might surely; but he may take the girl for himself all the same.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd sooner he had her than the other one, for he's one of\nourselves anyhow, and the devil you know is better than the devil you\ndon't know.\"\n\n\"Angus Og is a god,\" said the Philosopher severely.\n\n\"I know that, sir,\" replied Meehawl; \"it's only a way of talking I have.\nBut how will your honour get at Angus? for I heard say that he hadn't\nbeen seen for a hundred years, except one night only when he talked to a\nman for half an hour on Kilmasheogue.\"\n\n\"I'll find him, sure enough,\" replied the Philosopher.\n\n\"I'll warrant you will,\" replied Meehawl heartily as he stood up. \"Long\nlife and good health to your honour,\" said he as he turned away.\n\nThe Philosopher lit his pipe.\n\n\"We live as long as we are let,\" said he, \"and we get the health we\ndeserve. Your salutation embodies a reflection on death which is not\nphilosophic. We must acquiesce in all logical progressions. The merging\nof opposites is completion. Life runs to death as to its goal, and we\nshould go towards that next stage of experience either carelessly as to\nwhat must be, or with a good, honest curiosity as to what may be.\"\n\n\"There's not much fun in being dead, sir,\" said Meehawl.\n\n\"How do you know?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I know well enough,\" replied Meehawl.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nWHEN the children leaped into the hole at the foot of the tree they\nfound themselves sliding down a dark, narrow slant which dropped them\nsoftly enough into a little room. This room was hollowed out immediately\nunder the tree, and great care had been taken not to disturb any of\nthe roots which ran here and there through the chamber in the strangest\ncriss-cross, twisted fashion. To get across such a place one had to walk\nround, and jump over, and duck under perpetually. Some of the roots had\nformed themselves very conveniently into low seats and narrow, uneven\ntables, and at the bottom all the roots ran into the floor and away\nagain in the direction required by their business. After the clear air\noutside this place was very dark to the children's eyes, so that they\ncould not see anything for a few minutes, but after a little time their\neyes became accustomed to the semiobscurity and they were able to see\nquite well. The first things they became aware of were six small men who\nwere seated on low roots. They were all dressed in tight green clothes\nand little leathern aprons, and they wore tall green hats which wobbled\nwhen they moved. They were all busily engaged making shoes. One was\ndrawing out wax ends on his knee, another was softening pieces of\nleather in a bucket of water, another was polishing the instep of a shoe\nwith a piece of curved bone, another was paring down a heel with a short\nbroad-bladed knife, and another was hammering wooden pegs into a sole.\nHe had all the pegs in his mouth, which gave him a widefaced, jolly\nexpression, and according as a peg was wanted he blew it into his hand\nand hit it twice with his hammer, and then he blew another peg, and he\nalways blew the peg with the right end uppermost, and never had to hit\nit more than twice. He was a person well worth watching.\n\nThe children had slid down so unexpectedly that they almost forgot their\ngood manners, but as soon as Seumas Beg discovered that he was really in\na room he removed his cap and stood up.\n\n\"God be with all here,\" said he.\n\nThe Leprecaun who had brought them lifted Brigid from the floor to which\namazement still constrained her.\n\n\"Sit down on that little root, child of my heart,\" said he, \"and you can\nknit stockings for us.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Brigid meekly.\n\nThe Leprecaun took four knitting needles and a ball of green wool from\nthe top of a high, horizontal root. He had to climb over one, go round\nthree and climb up two roots to get at it, and he did this so easily\nthat it did not seem a bit of trouble. He gave the needles and wool to\nBrigid Beg.\n\n\"Do you know how to turn the heel, Brigid Beg?\" said he.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Brigid.\n\n\"Well, I'll show you how when you come to it.\"\n\nThe other six Leprecauns had ceased work and were looking at the\nchildren. Seumas turned to them.\n\n\"God bless the work,\" said he politely.\n\nOne of the Leprecauns, who had a grey, puckered face and a thin fringe\nof grey whisker very far under his chin, then spoke.\n\n\"Come over here, Seumas Beg,\" said he, \"and I'll measure you for a pair\nof shoes. Put your foot up on that root.\"\n\nThe boy did so, and the Leprecaun took the measure of his foot with a\nwooden rule.\n\n\"Now, Brigid Beg, show me your foot,\" and he measured her also. \"They'll\nbe ready for you in the morning.\"\n\n\"Do you never do anything else but make shoes, sir?\" said Seumas.\n\n\"We do not,\" replied the Leprecaun, \"except when we want new clothes,\nand then we have to make them, but we grudge every minute spent making\nanything else except shoes, because that is the proper work for a\nLeprecaun. In the night time we go about the country into people's\nhouses and we clip little pieces off their money, and so, bit by bit,\nwe get a crock of gold together, because, do you see, a Leprecaun has to\nhave a crock of gold so that if he's captured by men folk he may be\nable to ransom himself. But that seldom happens, because it's a great\ndisgrace altogether to be captured by a man, and we've practiced so long\ndodging among the roots here that we can easily get away from them. Of\ncourse, now and again we are caught; but men are fools, and we always\nescape without having to pay the ransom at all. We wear green clothes\nbecause it's the colour of the grass and the leaves, and when we sit\ndown under a bush or lie in the grass they just walk by without noticing\nus.\"\n\n\"Will you let me see your crock of gold?\" said Seumas.\n\nThe Leprecaun looked at him fixedly for a moment.\n\n\"Do you like griddle bread and milk?\" said he.\n\n\"I like it well,\" Seumas answered.\n\n\"Then you had better have some,\" and the Leprecaun took a piece of\ngriddle bread from the shelf and filled two saucers with milk.\n\nWhile the children were eating the Leprecauns asked them many questions\n\"What time do you get up in the morning?\"\n\n\"Seven o'clock,\" replied Seumas.\n\n\"And what do you have for breakfast?\"\n\n\"Stirabout and milk,\" he replied.\n\n\"It's good food,\" said the Leprecaun. \"What do you have for dinner?\"\n\n\"Potatoes and milk,\" said Seumas.\n\n\"It's not bad at all,\" said the Leprecaun. \"And what do you have for\nsupper?\"\n\nBrigid answered this time because her brother's mouth was full.\n\n\"Bread and milk, sir,\" said she.\n\n\"There's nothing better,\" said the Leprecaun.\n\n\"And then we go to bed,\" continued Brigid.\n\n\"Why wouldn't you?\" said the Leprecaun.\n\nIt was at this point the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath knocked on the tree\ntrunk and demanded that the children should be returned to her.\n\nWhen she had gone away the Leprecauns held a consultation, whereat it\nwas decided that they could not afford to anger the Thin Woman and the\nShee of Croghan Conghaile, so they shook hands with the children and\nbade them good-bye. The Leprecaun who had enticed them away from home\nbrought them back again, and on parting he begged the children to visit\nGort na Cloca Mora whenever they felt inclined.\n\n\"There's always a bit of griddle bread or potato cake, and a noggin of\nmilk for a friend,\" said he.\n\n\"You are very kind, sir,\" replied Seumas, and his sister said the same\nwords.\n\nAs the Leprecaun walked away they stood watching him.\n\n\"Do you remember,\" said Seumas, \"the way he hopped and waggled his leg\nthe last time he was here?\"\n\n\"I do so,\" replied Brigid.\n\n\"Well, he isn't hopping or doing anything at all this time,\" said\nSeumas.\n\n\"He's not in good humour to-night,\" said Brigid, \"but I like him.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Seumas.\n\nWhen they went into the house the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath was very\nglad to see them, and she baked a cake with currants in it, and also\ngave them both stir-about and potatoes; but the Philosopher did not\nnotice that they had been away at all. He said at last that \"talking was\nbad wit, that women were always making a fuss, that children should be\nfed, but not fattened, and that beds were meant to be slept in.\" The Thin\nWoman replied \"that he was a grisly old man without bowels, that she did\nnot know what she had married him for, that he was three times her age,\nand that no one would believe what she had to put up with.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nPURSUANT to his arrangement with Meehawl MacMurrachu, the Philosopher\nsent the children in search of Pan. He gave them the fullest\ninstructions as to how they should address the Sylvan Deity, and then,\nhaving received the admonishments of the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, the\nchildren departed in the early morning.\n\nWhen they reached the clearing in the pine wood, through which the sun\nwas blazing, they sat down for a little while to rest in the heat. Birds\nwere continually darting down this leafy shaft, and diving away into the\ndark wood. These birds always had something in their beaks. One would\nhave a worm, or a snail, or a grasshopper, or a little piece of wool\ntorn off a sheep, or a scrap of cloth, or a piece of hay; and when they\nhad put these things in a certain place they flew up the sun-shaft again\nand looked for something else to bring home. On seeing the children each\nof the birds waggled his wings, and made a particular sound. They said\n\"caw\" and \"chip\" and \"twit\" and \"tut\" and \"what\" and \"pit\"; and one,\nwhom the youngsters liked very much, always said \"tit-tittit-tit-tit.\"\nThe children were fond of him because he was so all-of-asudden. They\nnever knew where he was going to fly next, and they did not believe he\nknew himself. He would fly backwards and forwards, and up and down, and\nsideways and bawways--all, so to speak, in the one breath. He did this\nbecause he was curious to see what was happening everywhere, and, as\nsomething is always happening everywhere, he was never able to fly in\na straight line for more than the littlest distance. He was a cowardly\nbird too, and continually fancied that some person was going to throw\na stone at him from behind a bush, or a wall, or a tree, and these\nimaginary dangers tended to make his journeyings still more wayward and\nerratic. He never flew where he wanted to go himself, but only where God\ndirected him, and so he did not fare at all badly.\n\nThe children knew each of the birds by their sounds, and always said\nthese words to them when they came near. For a little time they had\ndifficulty in saying the right word to the right bird, and sometimes\nsaid \"chip\" when the salutation should have been \"tut.\" The birds always\nresented this, and would scold them angrily, but after a little practice\nthey never made any mistakes at all. There was one bird, a big, black\nfellow, who loved to be talked to. He used to sit on the ground beside\nthe children, and say \"caw\" as long as they would repeat it after him.\nHe often wasted a whole morning in talk, but none of the other birds\nremained for more than a few minutes at a time. They were always busy\nin the morning, but in the evening they had more leisure, and would stay\nand chat as long as the children wanted them. The awkward thing was that\nin the evening all the birds wanted to talk at the same moment, so that\nthe youngsters never knew which of them to answer. Seumas Beg got out\nof that difficulty for a while by learning to whistle their notes, but,\neven so, they spoke with such rapidity that he could not by any means\nkeep pace with them. Brigid could only whistle one note; it was a little\nflat \"whoo\" sound, which the birds all laughed at, and after a few\ntrials she refused to whistle any more.\n\nWhile they were sitting two rabbits came to play about in the brush.\nThey ran round and round in a circle, and all their movements were very\nquick and twisty. Sometimes they jumped over each other six or seven\ntimes in succession, and every now and then they sat upright on their\nhind legs, and washed their faces with their paws. At other times they\npicked up a blade of grass, which they ate with great deliberation,\npretending all the time that it was a complicated banquet of cabbage\nleaves and lettuce.\n\nWhile the children were playing with the rabbits an ancient, stalwart\nhe-goat came prancing through the bracken. He was an old acquaintance of\ntheirs, and he enjoyed lying beside them to have his forehead scratched\nwith a piece of sharp stick. His forehead was hard as rock, and the hair\ngrew there as sparse as grass does on a wall, or rather the way moss\ngrows on a wall--it was a mat instead of a crop. His horns were long and\nvery sharp, and brilliantly polished. On this day the he-goat had two\nchains around his neck--one was made of butter-cups and the other was\nmade of daisies, and the children wondered to each other who it was\ncould have woven these so carefully. They asked the he-goat this\nquestion, but he only looked at them and did not say a word. The\nchildren liked examining this goat's eyes; they were very big, and of\nthe queerest light-gray colour. They had a strange steadfast look, and\nhad also at times a look of queer, deep intelligence, and at other times\nthey had a fatherly and benevolent expression, and at other times\nagain, especially when he looked sidewards, they had a mischievous,\nlight-and-airy, daring, mocking, inviting and terrifying look; but he\nalways looked brave and unconcerned. When the he-goat's forehead had\nbeen scratched as much as he desired he arose from between the children\nand went pacing away lightly through the wood. The children ran after\nhim and each caught hold of one of his horns, and he ambled and reared\nbetween them while they danced along on his either side singing snatches\nof bird songs, and scraps of old tunes which the Thin Woman of Inis\nMagrath had learned among the people of the Shee.\n\nIn a little time they came to Gort na Cloca Mora, but here the he-goat\ndid not stop. They went past the big tree of the Leprecauns, through\na broken part of the hedge and into another rough field. The sun was\nshining gloriously. There was scarcely a wind at all to stir the harsh\ngrasses. Far and near was silence and warmth, an immense, cheerful\npeace. Across the sky a few light clouds sailed gently on a blue so vast\nthat the eye failed before that horizon. A few bees sounded their deep\nchant, and now and again a wasp rasped hastily on his journey. Than\nthese there was no sound of any kind. So peaceful, innocent and safe did\neverything appear that it might have been the childhood of the world as\nit was of the morning.\n\nThe children, still clinging to the friendly goat, came near the edge\nof the field, which here sloped more steeply to the mountain top. Great\nboulders, slightly covered with lichen and moss, were strewn about, and\naround them the bracken and gorse were growing, and in every crevice of\nthese rocks there were plants whose little, tight-fisted roots gripped\na desperate, adventurous habitation in a soil scarcely more than half\nan inch deep. At some time these rocks had been smitten so fiercely that\nthe solid granite surfaces had shattered into fragments. At one place\na sheer wall of stone, ragged and battered, looked harshly out from the\nthin vegetation. To this rocky wall the he-goat danced. At one place\nthere was a hole in the wall covered by a thick brush. The goat pushed\nhis way behind this growth and disappeared. Then the children, curious\nto see where he had gone, pushed through also. Behind the bush they\nfound a high, narrow opening, and when they had rubbed their legs, which\nsmarted from the stings of nettles, thistles and gorse prickles, they\nwent into the hole which they thought was a place the goat had for\nsleeping in on cold, wet nights. After a few paces they found the\npassage was quite comfortably big, and then they saw a light, and\nin another moment they were blinking at the god Pan and Caitilin Ni\nMurrachu.\n\nCaitilin knew them at once and came forward with welcome.\n\n\"O, Seumas Beg,\" she cried reproachfully, \"how dirty you have let your\nfeet get. Why don't you walk in the grassy places? And you, Brigid, have\na right to be ashamed of yourself to have your hands the way they are.\nCome over here at once.\"\n\nEvery child knows that every grown female person in the world has\nauthority to wash children and to give them food; that is what grown\npeople were made for, consequently Seumas and Brigid Beg submitted to\nthe scouring for which Caitilin made instant preparation. When they were\ncleaned she pointed to a couple of flat stones against the wall of the\ncave and bade them sit down and be good, and this the children did,\nfixing their eyes on Pan with the cheerful gravity and curiosity which\ngood-natured youngsters always give to a stranger.\n\nPan, who had been lying on a couch of dried grass, sat up and bent an\nequally cheerful regard on the children.\n\n\"Shepherd Girl,\" said he, \"who are those children?\"\n\n\"They are the children of the Philosophers of Coilla Doraca; the\nGrey Woman of Dun Gortin and the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath are their\nmothers, and they are decent, poor children, God bless them.\"\n\n\"What have they come here for?\"\n\n\"You will have to ask themselves that.\"\n\nPan looked at them smilingly.\n\n\"What have you come here for, little children?\" said he.\n\nThe children questioned one another with their eyes to see which of them\nwould reply, and then Seumas Beg answered:\n\n\"My father sent me to see you, sir, and to say that you were not doing a\ngood thing in keeping Caitilin Ni Murrachu away from her own place.\"\n\nBrigid Beg turned to Caitilin-\"Your father came to see our father, and\nhe said that he didn't know what had become of you at all, and that\nmaybe you were lying flat in a ditch with the black crows picking at\nyour flesh.\"\n\n\"And what,\" said Pan, \"did your father say to that?\"\n\n\"He told us to come and ask her to go home.\"\n\n\"Do you love your father, little child?\" said Pan.\n\nBrigid Beg thought for a moment. \"I don't know, sir,\" she replied.\n\n\"He doesn't mind us at all,\" broke in Seumas Beg, \"and so we don't know\nwhether we love him or not.\"\n\n\"I like Caitilin,\" said Brigid, \"and I like you.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Seumas.\n\n\"I like you also, little children,\" said Pan. \"Come over here and sit\nbeside me, and we will talk.\"\n\nSo the two children went over to Pan and sat down one each side of him,\nand he put his arms about them. \"Daughter of Murrachu,\" said he, \"is\nthere no food in the house for guests?\"\n\n\"There is a cake of bread, a little goat's milk and some cheese,\" she\nreplied, and she set about getting these things.\n\n\"I never ate cheese,\" said Seumas. \"Is it good?\"\n\n\"Surely it is,\" replied Pan. \"The cheese that is made from goat's milk\nis rather strong, and it is good to be eaten by people who live in the\nopen air, but not by those who live in houses, for such people do not\nhave any appetite. They are poor creatures whom I do not like.\"\n\n\"I like eating,\" said Seumas.\n\n\"So do I,\" said Pan. \"All good people like eating. Every person who is\nhungry is a good person, and every person who is not hungry is a bad\nperson. It is better to be hungry than rich.\"\n\nCaitilin having supplied the children with food, seated herself in front\nof them. \"I don't think that is right,\" said she. \"I have always been\nhungry, and it was never good.\"\n\n\"If you had always been full you would like it even less,\" he replied,\n\"because when you are hungry you are alive, and when you are not hungry\nyou are only half alive.\"\n\n\"One has to be poor to be hungry,\" replied Caitilin. \"My father is poor\nand gets no good of it but to work from morning to night and never to\nstop doing that.\"\n\n\"It is bad for a wise person to be poor,\" said Pan, \"and it is bad for a\nfool to be rich. A rich fool will think of nothing else at first but to\nfind a dark house wherein to hide away, and there he will satisfy his\nhunger, and he will continue to do that until his hunger is dead and\nhe is no better than dead but a wise person who is rich will carefully\npreserve his appetite. All people who have been rich for a long time, or\nwho are rich from birth, live a great deal outside of their houses, and\nso they are always hungry and healthy.\"\n\n\"Poor people have no time to be wise,\" said Caitilin.\n\n\"They have time to be hungry,\" said Pan. \"I ask no more of them.\"\n\n\"My father is very wise,\" said Seumas Beg.\n\n\"How do you know that, little boy?\" said Pan.\n\n\"Because he is always talking,\" replied Seumas. \"Do you always listen,\nmy dear?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Seumas; \"I go to sleep when he talks.\"\n\n\"That is very clever of you,\" said Pan.\n\n\"I go to sleep too,\" said Brigid.\n\n\"It is clever of you also, my darling. Do you go to sleep when your\nmother talks?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she answered. \"If we went to sleep then our mother would pinch\nus and say that we were a bad breed.\"\n\n\"I think your mother is wise,\" said Pan. \"What do you like best in the\nworld, Seumas Beg?\"\n\nThe boy thought for a moment and replied: \"I don't know, sir.\"\n\nPan also thought for a little time.\n\n\"I don't know what I like best either,\" said he. \"What do you like best\nin the world, Shepherd Girl?\"\n\nCaitilin's eyes were fixed on his.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" she answered slowly.\n\n\"May the gods keep you safe from that knowledge,\" said Pan gravely.\n\n\"Why would you say that?\" she replied. \"One must find out all things,\nand when we find out a thing we know if it is good or bad.\"\n\n\"That is the beginning of knowledge,\" said Pan, \"but it is not the\nbeginning of wisdom.\"\n\n\"What is the beginning of wisdom?\"\n\n\"It is carelessness,\" replied Pan.\n\n\"And what is the end of wisdom?\" said she.\n\n\"I do not know,\" he answered, after a little pause.\n\n\"Is it greater carelessness?\" she enquired.\n\n\"I do not know, I do not know,\" said he sharply. \"I am tired of\ntalking,\" and, so saying, he turned his face away from them and lay down\non the couch.\n\nCaitilin in great concern hurried the children to the door of the cave\nand kissed them good-bye.\n\n\"Pan is sick,\" said the boy gravely.\n\n\"I hope he will be well soon again,\" the girl murmured.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Caitilin, and she ran back quickly to her lord.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II. THE PHILOSOPHER'S JOURNEY\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nWHEN the children reached home they told the Philosopher-the result of\ntheir visit. He questioned them minutely as to the appearance of\nPan, how he had received them, and what he had said in defence of his\niniquities; but when he found that Pan had not returned any answer\nto his message he became very angry. He tried to persuade his wife to\nundertake another embassy setting forth his abhorrence and defiance of\nthe god, but the Thin Woman replied sourly that she was a respectable\nmarried woman, that having been already bereaved of her wisdom she had\nno desire to be further curtailed of her virtue, that a husband would go\nany length to asperse his wife's reputation, and that although she was\nmarried to a fool her self-respect had survived even that calamity. The\nPhilosopher pointed out that her age, her appearance, and her tongue\nwere sufficient guarantees of immunity against the machinations of\neither Pan or slander, and that he had no personal feelings in the\nmatter beyond a scientific and benevolent interest in the troubles\nof Meehawl MacMurrachu; but this was discounted by his wife as the\nmalignant and subtle tactics customary to all husbands.\n\nMatters appeared to be thus at a deadlock so far as they were\nimmediately concerned, and the Philosopher decided that he would lay the\ncase before Angus Og and implore his protection and assistance on behalf\nof the Clann MacMurrachu. He therefore directed the Thin Woman to bake\nhim two cakes of bread, and set about preparations for a journey.\n\nThe Thin Woman baked the cakes, and put them in a bag, and early on the\nfollowing morning the Philosopher swung this bag over his shoulder, and\nwent forth on his quest.\n\nWhen he came to the edge of the pine wood he halted for a few moments,\nnot being quite certain of his bearings, and then went forward again in\nthe direction of Gort na Cloca Mora. It came into his mind as he crossed\nthe Gort that he ought to call on the Leprecauns and have a talk with\nthem, but a remembrance of Meehawl MacMurrachu and the troubles under\nwhich he laboured (all directly to be traced to the Leprecauns) hardened\nhis heart against his neighbours, so that he passed by the yew tree\nwithout any stay. In a short time he came to the rough, heather-clumped\nfield wherein the children had found Pan, and as he was proceeding up\nthe hill, he saw Caitilin Ni Murrachu walking a little way in front with\na small vessel in her hand. The she-goat which she had just milked was\nbending again to the herbage, and as Caitilin trod lightly in front of\nhim the Philosopher closed his eyes in virtuous anger and opened them\nagain in a not unnatural curiosity, for the girl had no clothes on. He\nwatched her going behind the brush and disappearing in the cleft of the\nrock, and his anger, both with her and Pan, mastering him he forsook\nthe path of prudence which soared to the mountain top, and followed that\nleading to the cave. The sound of his feet brought Caitilin out hastily,\nbut he pushed her by with a harsh word. \"Hussy,\" said he, and he went\ninto the cave where Pan was.\n\nAs he went in he already repented of his harshness and said \"The\nhuman body is an aggregation of flesh and sinew, around a central bony\nstructure. The use of clothing is primarily to protect this organism\nfrom rain and cold, and it may not be regarded as the banner of morality\nwithout danger to this fundamental premise. If a person does not desire\nto be so protected who will quarrel with an honourable liberty? Decency\nis not clothing but Mind. Morality is behaviour. Virtue is thought; I\nhave often fancied,\" he continued to Pan, whom he was now confronting,\n\"that the effect of clothing on mind must be very considerable, and that\nit must have a modifying rather than an expanding effect, or, even, an\nintensifying as against an exuberant effect. With clothing the whole\nenvironment is immediately affected. The air, which is our proper\nmedium, is only filtered to our bodies in an abated and niggardly\nfashion which can scarcely be as beneficial as the generous and\nunintermitted elemental play. The question naturally arises whether\nclothing is as unknown to nature as we have fancied? Viewed as a\nprotective measure against atmospheric rigour we find that many\ncreatures grow, by their own central impulse, some kind of exterior\npanoply which may be regarded as their proper clothing. Bears, cats,\ndogs, mice, sheep and beavers are wrapped in fur, hair, fell, fleece or\npelt, so these creatures cannot by any means be regarded as being naked.\nCrabs, cockroaches, snails and cockles have ordered around them a crusty\nhabiliment, wherein their original nakedness is only to be discovered by\nforce, and other creatures have similarly provided themselves with\nsome species of covering. Clothing, therefore, is not an art, but an\ninstinct, and the fact that man is born naked and does not grow his\nclothing upon himself from within but collects it from various distant\nand haphazard sources is not any reason to call this necessity an\ninstinct for decency. These, you will admit, are weighty reflections and\nworthy of consideration before we proceed to the wide and thorny subject\nof moral and immoral action. Now, what is virtue?\" Pan, who had listened\nwith great courtesy to these remarks, here broke in on the Philosopher.\n\n\"Virtue,\" said he, \"is the performance of pleasant actions.\"\n\nThe Philosopher held the statement for a moment on his forefinger.\n\n\"And what, then, is vice?\" said he.\n\n\"It is vicious,\" said Pan, \"to neglect the performance of pleasant\nactions.\"\n\n\"If this be so,\" the other commented, \"philosophy has up to the present\nbeen on the wrong track.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" said Pan. \"Philosophy is an immoral practice because it\nsuggests a standard of practice impossible of being followed, and which,\nif it could be followed, would lead to the great sin of sterility.\"\n\n\"The idea of virtue,\" said the Philosopher, with some indignation, \"has\nanimated the noblest intellects of the world.\"\n\n\"It has not animated them,\" replied Pan; \"it has hypnotised them so\nthat they have conceived virtue as repression and self-sacrifice as an\nhonourable thing instead of the suicide which it is.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the Philosopher; \"this is very interesting, and if it is\ntrue the whole conduct of life will have to be very much simplified.\"\n\n\"Life is already very simple,\" said Pan; \"it is to be born and to die,\nand in the interval to eat and drink, to dance and sing, to marry and\nbeget children.\"\n\n\"But it is simply materialism,\" cried the Philosopher.\n\n\"Why do you say 'but'?\" replied Pan.\n\n\"It is sheer, unredeemed animalism,\" continued his visitor.\n\n\"It is any name you please to call it,\" replied Pan.\n\n\"You have proved nothing,\" the Philosopher shouted.\n\n\"What can be sensed requires no proof.\"\n\n\"You leave out the new thing,\" said the Philosopher. \"You leave out\nbrains. I believe in mind above matter. Thought above emotion. Spirit\nabove flesh.\"\n\n\"Of course you do,\" said Pan, and he reached for his oaten pipe.\n\nThe Philosopher ran to the opening of the passage and thrust Caitilin\naside. \"Hussy,\" said he fiercely to her, and he darted out.\n\nAs he went up the rugged path he could hear the pipes of Pan, calling\nand sobbing and making high merriment on the air.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"SHE does not deserve to be rescued,\" said the Philosopher, \"but I will\nrescue her. Indeed,\" he thought a moment later, \"she does not want to be\nrescued, and, therefore, I will rescue her.\"\n\nAs he went down the road her shapely figure floated before his eyes as\nbeautiful and simple as an old statue. He wagged his head angrily at the\napparition, but it would not go away. He tried to concentrate his mind\non a deep, philosophical maxim, but her disturbing image came between\nhim and his thought, blotting out the latter so completely that a moment\nafter he had stated his aphorism he could not remember what it had been.\nSuch a condition of mind was so unusual that it bewildered him.\n\n\"Is a mind, then, so unstable,\" said he, \"that a mere figure, an\nanimated geometrical arrangement can shake it from its foundations?\"\n\nThe idea horrified him: he saw civilisation building its temples over a\nvolcano...\n\n\"A puff,\" said he, \"and it is gone. Beneath all is chaos and red\nanarchy, over all a devouring and insistent appetite. Our eyes tell\nus what to think about, and our wisdom is no more than a catalogue of\nsensual stimuli.\"\n\nHe would have been in a state of deep dejection were it not that through\nhis perturbation there bubbled a stream of such amazing well-being as he\nhad not felt since childhood. Years had toppled from his shoulders. He\nleft one pound of solid matter behind at every stride. His very skin\ngrew flexuous, and he found a pleasure in taking long steps such as he\ncould not have accounted for by thought. Indeed, thought was the one\nthing he felt unequal to, and it was not precisely that he could not\nthink but that he did not want to. All the importance and authority\nof his mind seemed to have faded away, and the activity which had\nonce belonged to that organ was now transferred to his eyes. He saw,\namazedly, the sunshine bathing the hills and the valleys. A bird in\nthe hedge held him--beak, head, eyes, legs, and the wings that tapered\nwidely at angles to the wind. For the first time in his life he really\nsaw a bird, and one minute after it had flown away he could have\nreproduced its strident note. With every step along the curving road\nthe landscape was changing. He saw and noted it almost in an ecstasy. A\nsharp hill jutted out into the road, it dissolved into a sloping meadow,\nrolled down into a valley and then climbed easily and peacefully into\na hill again. On this side a clump of trees nodded together in the\nfriendliest fashion. Yonder a solitary tree, well-grown and clean, was\ncontented with its own bright company. A bush crouched tightly on the\nground as though, at a word, it would scamper from its place and chase\nrabbits across the sward with shouts and laughter. Great spaces of\nsunshine were everywhere, and everywhere there were deep wells of\nshadow; and the one did not seem more beautiful than the other. That\nsunshine! Oh, the glory of it, the goodness and bravery of it, how\nbroadly and grandly it shone, without stint, without care; he saw its\nmeasureless generosity and gloried in it as though himself had been the\nflinger of that largesse. And was he not? Did the sunlight not stream\nfrom his head and life from his finger-tips? Surely the well-being that\nwas in him did bubble out to an activity beyond the universe. Thought!\nOh! the petty thing! but motion! emotion! these were the realities. To\nfeel, to do, to stride forward in elation chanting a paean of triumphant\nlife!\n\nAfter a time he felt hungry, and thrusting his hand into his wallet he\nbroke off a piece of one of his cakes and looked about for a place where\nhe might happily eat it. By the side of the road there was a well; just\na little corner filled with water. Over it was a rough stone coping, and\naround, hugging it on three sides almost from sight, were thick, quiet\nbushes. He would not have noticed the well at all but for a thin stream,\nthe breadth of two hands, which tiptoed away from it through a field.\nBy this well he sat down and scooped the water in his hand and it tasted\ngood.\n\nHe was eating his cake when a sound touched his ear from some distance,\nand shortly a woman came down the path carrying a vessel in her hand to\ndraw water.\n\nShe was a big, comely woman, and she walked as one who had no\nmisfortunes and no misgivings. When she saw the Philosopher sitting by\nthe well she halted a moment in surprise and then came forward with a\ngood-humoured smile.\n\n\"Good morrow to you, sir,\" said she.\n\n\"Good morrow to you too, ma'am,\" replied the Philosopher. \"Sit down\nbeside me here and eat some of my cake.\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't I, indeed,\" said the woman, and she did sit beside him.\n\nThe Philosopher cracked a large piece off his cake and gave it to her\nand she ate some.\n\n\"There's a taste on that cake,\" said she. \"Who made it?\"\n\n\"My wife did,\" he replied.\n\n\"Well, now!\" said she, looking at him. \"Do you know, you don't look a\nbit like a married man.\"\n\n\"No?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Not a bit. A married man looks comfortable and settled: he looks\nfinished, if you understand me, and a bachelor looks unsettled and\nfunny, and he always wants to be running round seeing things. I'd know a\nmarried man from a bachelor any day.\"\n\n\"How would you know that?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Easily,\" said she, with a nod. \"It's the way they look at a woman.\nA married man looks at you quietly as if he knew all about you. There\nisn't any strangeness about him with a woman at all; but a bachelor man\nlooks at you very sharp and looks away and then looks back again, the\nway you'd know he was thinking about you and didn't know what you were\nthinking about him; and so they are always strange, and that's why women\nlike them.\"\n\n\"Why!\" said the Philosopher, astonished, \"do women like bachelors better\nthan married men?\"\n\n\"Of course they do,\" she replied heartily. \"They wouldn't look at the\nside of the road a married man was on if there was a bachelor man on the\nother side.\"\n\n\"This,\" said the Philosopher earnestly, \"is very interesting.\"\n\n\"And the queer thing is,\" she continued, \"that when I came up the road\nand saw you I said to myself 'it's a bachelor man.' How long have you\nbeen married, now?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the Philosopher. \"Maybe it's ten years.\"\n\n\"And how many children would you have, mister?\"\n\n\"Two,\" he replied, and then corrected himself, \"No, I have only one.\"\n\n\"Is the other one dead?\"\n\n\"I never had more than one.\"\n\n\"Ten years married and only one child,\" said she. \"Why, man dear, you're\nnot a married man. What were you doing at all, at all! I wouldn't like\nto be telling you the children I have living and dead. But what I say is\nthat married or not you're a bachelor man. I knew it the minute I looked\nat you. What sort of a woman is herself?\"\n\n\"She's a thin sort of woman,\" cried the Philosopher, biting into his\ncake.\n\n\"Is she now?\"\n\n\"And,\" the Philosopher continued, \"the reason I talked to you is because\nyou are a fat woman.\"\n\n\"I am not fat,\" was her angry response.\n\n\"You are fat,\" insisted the Philosopher, \"and that's the reason I like\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you mean it that way...\" she chuckled.\n\n\"I think,\" he continued, looking at her admiringly, \"that women ought to\nbe fat.\"\n\n\"Tell you the truth,\" said she eagerly, \"I think that myself. I never\nmet a thin woman but she was a sour one, and I never met a fat man but\nhe was a fool. Fat women and thin men; it's nature,\" said she.\n\n\"It is,\" said he, and he leaned forward and kissed her eye.\n\n\"Oh, you villain!\" said the woman, putting out her hands against him.\n\nThe Philosopher drew back abashed. \"Forgive me,\" he began, \"if I have\nalarmed your virtue--\"\n\n\"It's the married man's word,\" said she, rising hastily: \"now I know\nyou; but there's a lot of the bachelor in you all the same, God help\nyou! I'm going home.\" And, so saying, she dipped her vessel in the well\nand turned away.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said the Philosopher, \"I ought to wait until your husband comes\nhome and ask his forgiveness for the wrong I've done him.\"\n\nThe woman turned round on him and each of her eyes was as big as a\nplate.\n\n\"What do you say?\" said she. \"Follow me if you dare and I'll set the dog\non you; I will so,\" and she strode viciously homewards.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation the Philosopher took his own path across the\nhill.\n\nThe day was now well advanced, and as he trudged forward the happy\nquietude of his surroundings stole into his heart again and so toned\ndown his recollection of the fat woman that in a little time she was\nno more than a pleasant and curious memory. His mind was exercised\nsuperficially, not in thinking, but in wondering how it was he had come\nto kiss a strange woman. He said to himself that such conduct was not\nright; but this statement was no more than the automatic working of a\nmind long exercised in the distinctions of right and wrong, for, almost\nin the same breath, he assured himself that what he had done did not\nmatter in the least. His opinions were undergoing a curious change.\nRight and wrong were meeting and blending together so closely that it\nbecame difficult to dissever them, and the obloquy attaching to the one\nseemed out of proportion altogether to its importance, while the other\nby no means justified the eulogy wherewith it was connected. Was there\nany immediate or even distant, effect on life caused by evil which\nwas not instantly swung into equipoise by goodness? But these slender\nreflections troubled him only for a little time. He had little desire\nfor any introspective quarryings. To feel so well was sufficient in\nitself. Why should thought be so apparent to us, so insistent? We do\nnot know we have digestive or circulatory organs until these go out of\norder, and then the knowledge torments us. Should not the labours of a\nhealthy brain be equally subterranean and equally competent? Why have we\nto think aloud and travel laboriously from syllogism to ergo, chary of\nour conclusions and distrustful of our premises? Thought, as we know\nit, is a disease and no more. The healthy mentality should register its\nconvictions and not its labours. Our ears should not hear the clamour of\nits doubts nor be forced to listen to the pro and con wherewith we are\neternally badgered and perplexed.\n\nThe road was winding like a ribbon in and out of the mountains. On\neither side there were hedges and bushes,--little, stiff trees which\nheld their foliage in their hands and dared the winds snatch a leaf from\nthat grip. The hills were swelling and sinking, folding and soaring\non every view. Now the silence was startled by the falling tinkle of a\nstream. Far away a cow lowed, a long, deep monotone, or a goat's call\ntrembled from nowhere to nowhere. But mostly there was a silence which\nbuzzed with a multitude of small winged life. Going up the hills the\nPhilosopher bent forward to the gradient, stamping vigorously as he\ntrod, almost snorting like a bull in the pride of successful energy.\nComing down the slope he braced back and let his legs loose to do as\nthey pleased. Didn't they know their business--Good luck to them, and\naway!\n\nAs he walked along he saw an old woman hobbling in front of him. She was\nleaning on a stick and her hand was red and swollen with rheumatism. She\nhobbled by reason of the fact that there were stones in her shapeless\nboots. She was draped in the sorriest miscellaneous rags that could\nbe imagined, and these were knotted together so intricately that her\nclothing, having once been attached to her body, could never again\nbe detached from it. As she walked she was mumbling and grumbling to\nherself, so that her mouth moved round and round in an india-rubber\nfashion.\n\nThe Philosopher soon caught up on her.\n\n\"Good morrow, ma'am,\" said he.\n\nBut she did not hear him: she seemed to be listening to the pain which\nthe stones in her boots gave her.\n\n\"Good morrow, ma'am,\" said the Philosopher again.\n\nThis time she heard him and replied, turning her old, bleared eyes\nslowly in his direction-\"Good morrow to yourself, sir,\" said she, and\nthe Philosopher thought her old face was a very kindly one.\n\n\"What is it that is wrong with you, ma'am?\" said he.\n\n\"It's my boots, sir,\" she replied. \"Full of stones they are, the way I\ncan hardly walk at all, God help me!\"\n\n\"Why don't you shake them out?\"\n\n\"Ah, sure, I couldn't be bothered, sir, for there are so many holes in\nthe boots that more would get in before I could take two steps, and an\nold woman can't be always fidgeting, God help her!\"\n\nThere was a little house on one side of the road, and when the old woman\nsaw this place she brightened up a little.\n\n\"Do you know who lives in that house?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I do not,\" she replied, \"but it's a real nice house with clean windows\nand a shiny knocker on the door, and smoke in the chimney--I wonder\nwould herself give me a cup of tea now if I asked her--A poor old\nwoman walking the roads on a stick! and maybe a bit of meat, or an egg\nperhaps....\"\n\n\"You could ask,\" suggested the Philosopher gently.\n\n\"Maybe I will, too,\" said she, and she sat down by the road just outside\nthe house and the Philosopher also sat down.\n\nA little puppy dog came from behind the house and approached them\ncautiously. Its intentions were friendly but it had already found that\namicable advances are sometimes indifferently received, for, as it drew\nnear, it wagged its dubious tail and rolled humbly on the ground. But\nvery soon the dog discovered that here there was no evil, for it trotted\nover to the old woman, and without any more preparation jumped into her\nlap.\n\nThe old woman grinned at the dog \"Ah, you thing you!\" said she, and she\ngave it her finger to bite. The delighted puppy chewed her bony\nfinger, and then instituted a mimic warfare against a piece of rag that\nfluttered from her breast, barking and growling in joyous excitement,\nwhile the old woman fondled and hugged it.\n\nThe door of the house opposite opened quickly, and a woman with a\nfrost-bitten face came out.\n\n\"Leave that dog down,\" said she.\n\nThe old woman grinned humbly at her.\n\n\"Sure, ma'am, I wouldn't hurt the little dog, the thing!\"\n\n\"Put down that dog,\" said the woman, \"and go about your business--the\nlikes of you ought to be arrested.\"\n\nA man in shirt sleeves appeared behind her, and at him the old woman\ngrinned even more humbly.\n\n\"Let me sit here for a while and play with the little dog, sir,\" said\nshe; \"sure the roads do be lonesome--\"\n\nThe man stalked close and grabbed the dog by the scruff of the neck. It\nhung between his finger and thumb with its tail tucked between its legs\nand its eyes screwed round on one side in amazement.\n\n\"Be off with you out of that, you old strap!\" said the man in a terrible\nvoice.\n\nSo the old woman rose painfully to her feet again, and as she went\nhobbling along the dusty road she began to cry.\n\nThe Philosopher also arose; he was very indignant but did not know what\nto do. A singular lassitude also prevented him from interfering. As they\npaced along his companion began mumbling, more to herself than to him\n\"Ah, God be with me,\" said she, \"an old woman on a stick, that hasn't\na place in the wide world to go to or a neighbour itself.... I wish\nI could get a cup of tea, so I do. I wish to God I could get a cup\nof tea.... Me sitting down in my own little house, with the white\ntablecloth on the table, and the butter in the dish, and the strong, red\ntea in the tea-cup; and me pouring cream into it, and, maybe, telling\nthe children not to be wasting the sugar, the things! and himself saying\nhe'd got to mow the big field to-day, or that the red cow was going\nto calve, the poor thing, and that if the boys went to school, who was\ngoing to weed the turnips--and me sitting drinking my strong cup of tea,\nand telling him where that old trapesing hen was laying.... Ah, God be\nwith me! an old creature hobbling along the roads on a stick. I wish I\nwas a young girl again, so I do, and himself coming courting me, and him\nsaying that I was a real nice little girl surely, and that nothing would\nmake him happy or easy at all but me to be loving him.--Ah, the kind man\nthat he was, to be sure, the kind, decent man.... And Sorca Reilly to be\ntrying to get him from me, and Kate Finnegan with her bold eyes looking\nafter him in the Chapel; and him to be saying that along with me they\nwere only a pair of old nanny goats.... And then me to be getting\nmarried and going home to my own little house with my man--ah, God be\nwith me! and him kissing me, and laughing, and frightening me with his\ngoings-on. Ah, the kind man, with his soft eyes, and his nice voice, and\nhis jokes and laughing, and him thinking the world and all of me--ay,\nindeed.... And the neighbours to be coming in and sitting round the fire\nin the night time, putting the world through each other, and talking\nabout France and Russia and them other queer places, and him holding\nup the discourse like a learned man, and them all listening to him and\nnodding their heads at each other, and wondering at his education and\nall: or, maybe, the neighbours to be singing, or him making me sing the\nCoulin, and him to be proud of me... and then him to be killed on me\nwith a cold on his chest. ... Ah, then, God be with me, a lone,\nold creature on a stick, and the sun shining into her eyes and she\nthirsty--I wish I had a cup of tea, so I do. I wish to God I had a cup\nof tea and a bit of meat... or, maybe, an egg. A nice fresh egg laid\nby the speckeldy hen that used to be giving me all the trouble, the\nthing!... Sixteen hens I had, and they were the ones for laying,\nsurely.... It's the queer world, so it is, the queer world--and the\nthings that do happen for no reason at all.... Ah, God be with me! I\nwish there weren't stones in my boots, so I do, and I wish to God I had\na cup of tea and a fresh egg. Ah, glory be, my old legs are getting\ntireder every day, so they are. Wisha, one time--when himself was in\nit--I could go about the house all day long, cleaning the place, and\nfeeding the pigs, and the hens and all, and then dance half the night,\nso I could: and himself proud of me....\"\n\nThe old woman turned up a little rambling road and went on still talking\nto herself, and the Philosopher watched her go up that road for a long\ntime. He was very glad she had gone away, and as he tramped forward he\nbanished her sad image so that in a little time he was happy again. The\nsun was still shining, the birds were flying on every side, and the wide\nhill-side above him smiled gaily.\n\nA small, narrow road cut at right angles into his path, and as he\napproached this he heard the bustle and movement of a host, the trample\nof feet, the rolling and creaking of wheels, and the long unwearied\ndrone of voices. In a few minutes he came abreast of this small road,\nand saw an ass and cart piled with pots and pans, and walking beside\nthis there were two men and a woman. The men and the woman were talking\ntogether loudly, even fiercely, and the ass was drawing his cart along\nthe road without requiring assistance or direction. While there was a\nroad he walked on it: when he might come to a cross road he would turn\nto the right: when a man said \"whoh\" he would stop: when he said \"hike\"\nhe would go backwards, and when he said \"yep\" he would go on again. That\nwas life, and if one questioned it, one was hit with a stick, or a boot,\nor a lump of rock: if one continued walking nothing happened, and that\nwas happiness.\n\nThe Philosopher saluted this cavalcade.\n\n\"God be with you,\" said he.\n\n\"God and Mary be with you,\" said the first man.\n\n\"God, and Mary, and Patrick be with you,\" said the second man.\n\n\"God, and Mary, and Patrick, and Brigid be with you,\" said the woman.\n\nThe ass, however, did not say a thing. As the word \"whoh\" had not\nentered into the conversation he knew it was none of his business, and\nso he turned to the right on the new path and continued his journey.\n\n\"Where are you going to, stranger,\" said the first man.\n\n\"I am going to visit Angus Og,\" replied the Philosopher.\n\nThe man gave him a quick look.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"that's the queerest story I ever heard. Listen here,\"\nhe called to the others, \"this man is looking for Angus Og.\"\n\nThe other man and woman came closer.\n\n\"What would you be wanting with Angus Og, Mister Honey?\" said the woman.\n\n\"Oh,\" replied the Philosopher, \"it's a particular thing, a family\nmatter.\"\n\nThere was silence for a few minutes, and they all stepped onwards behind\nthe ass and cart.\n\n\"How do you know where to look for himself?\" said the first man again:\n\"maybe you got the place where he lives written down in an old book or\non a carved stone?\"\n\n\"Or did you find the staff of Amergin or of Ossian in a bog and it\nwritten from the top to the bottom with signs?\" said the second man.\n\n\"No,\" said the Philosopher, \"it isn't that way you'd go visiting a god.\nWhat you do is, you go out from your house and walk straight away in\nany direction with your shadow behind you so long as it is towards a\nmountain, for the gods will not stay in a valley or a level plain, but\nonly in high places; and then, if the god wants you to see him, you will\ngo to his rath as direct as if you knew where it was, for he will be\nleading you with an airy thread reaching from his own place to wherever\nyou are, and if he doesn't want to see you, you will never find out\nwhere he is, not if you were to walk for a year or twenty years.\"\n\n\"How do you know he wants to see you?\" said the second man.\n\n\"Why wouldn't he want?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Maybe, Mister Honey,\" said the woman, \"you are a holy sort of a man\nthat a god would like well.\"\n\n\"Why would I be that?\" said the Philosopher. \"The gods like a man\nwhether he's holy or not if he's only decent.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, there's plenty of that sort,\" said the first man. \"What do\nyou happen to have in your bag, stranger?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied the Philosopher, \"but a cake and a half that was\nbaked for my journey.\"\n\n\"Give me a bit of your cake, Mister Honey,\" said the woman. \"I like to\nhave a taste of everybody's cake.\"\n\n\"I will, and welcome,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"You may as well give us all a bit while you are about it,\" said the\nsecond man. \"That woman hasn't got all the hunger of the world.\"\n\n\"Why not,\" said the Philosopher, and he divided the cake.\n\n\"There's a sup of water up yonder,\" said the first man, \"and it will do\nto moisten the cake--Whoh, you devil,\" he roared at the ass, and the ass\nstood stock still on the minute.\n\nThere was a thin fringe of grass along the road near a wall, and towards\nthis the ass began to edge very gently.\n\n\"Hike, you beast, you,\" shouted the man, and the ass at once hiked, but\nhe did it in a way that brought him close to the grass. The first man\ntook a tin can out of the cart and climbed over the little wall for\nwater. Before he went he gave the ass three kicks on the nose, but\nthe ass did not say a word, he only hiked still more which brought him\ndirectly on to the grass, and when the man climbed over the wall the ass\ncommenced to crop the grass. There was a spider sitting on a hot stone\nin the grass. He had a small body and wide legs, and he wasn't doing\nanything.\n\n\"Does anybody ever kick you in the nose?\" said the ass to him.\n\n\"Ay does there,\" said the spider; \"you and your like that are always\nwalking on me, or lying down on me, or running over me with the wheels\nof a cart.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't you stay on the wall?\" said the ass.\n\n\"Sure, my wife is there,\" replied the spider.\n\n\"What's the harm in that?\" said the ass.\n\n\"She'd eat me,\" said the spider, \"and, anyhow, the competition on the\nwall is dreadful, and the flies are getting wiser and timider every\nseason. Have you got a wife yourself, now?\"\n\n\"I have not,\" said the ass; \"I wish I had.\"\n\n\"You like your wife for the first while,\" said the spider, \"and after\nthat you hate her.\"\n\n\"If I had the first while I'd chance the second while,\" replied the ass.\n\n\"It's bachelor's talk,\" said the spider; \"all the same, we can't keep\naway from them,\" and so saying he began to move all his legs at once in\nthe direction of the wall. \"You can only die once,\" said he.\n\n\"If your wife was an ass she wouldn't eat you,\" said the ass.\n\n\"She'd be doing something else then,\" replied the spider, and he climbed\nup the wall.\n\nThe first man came back with the can of water and they sat down on the\ngrass and ate the cake and drank the water. All the time the woman kept\nher eyes fixed on the Philosopher.\n\n\"Mister Honey,\" said she, \"I think you met us just at the right moment.\"\n\nThe other two men sat upright and looked at each other and then with\nequal intentness they looked at the woman.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"We were having a great argument along the road, and if we were to\nbe talking from now to the dav of doom that argument would never be\nfinished.\"\n\n\"It must have been a great argument. Was it about predestination or\nwhere consciousness comes from?\"\n\n\"It was not; it was which of these two men was to marry me.\"\n\n\"That's not a great argument,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Isn't it,\" said the woman. \"For seven days and six nights we didn't\ntalk about anything else, and that's a great argument or I'd like to\nknow what is.\"\n\n\"But where is the trouble, ma'am?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"It's this,\" she replied, \"that I can't make up my mind which of the men\nI'll take, for I like one as well as the other and better, and I'd as\nsoon have one as the other and rather.\"\n\n\"It's a hard case,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"It is,\" said the woman, \"and I'm sick and sorry with the trouble of\nit.\"\n\n\"And why did you say that I had come up in a good minute?\"\n\n\"Because, Mister Honey, when a woman has two men to choose from she\ndoesn't know what to do, for two men always become like brothers so\nthat you wouldn't know which of them was which: there isn't any more\ndifference between two men than there is between a couple of hares. But\nwhen there's three men to choose from, there's no trouble at all; and so\nI say that it's yourself I'll marry this night and no one else--and let\nyou two men be sitting quiet in your places, for I'm telling you what\nI'll do and that's the end of it.\"\n\n\"I'll give you my word,\" said the first man, \"that I'm just as glad as\nyou are to have it over and done with.\"\n\n\"Moidered I was,\" said the second man, \"with the whole argument, and the\nthis and that of it, and you not able to say a word but--maybe I will\nand maybe I won't, and this is true and that is true, and why not to me\nand why not to him--I'll get a sleep this night.\"\n\nThe Philosopher was perplexed.\n\n\"You cannot marry me, ma'am,\" said he, \"because I'm married already.\"\n\nThe woman turned round on him angrily.\n\n\"Don't be making any argument with me now,\" said she, \"for I won't stand\nit.\"\n\nThe first man looked fiercely at the Philosopher, and then motioned to\nhis companion.\n\n\"Give that man a clout in the jaw,\" said he.\n\nThe second man was preparing to do this when the woman intervened\nangrily.\n\n\"Keep your hands to yourself,\" said she, \"or it'll be the worse for you.\nI'm well able to take care of my own husband,\" and she drew nearer and\nsat between the Philosopher and the men.\n\nAt that moment the Philosopher's cake lost all its savour, and he packed\nthe remnant into his wallet. They all sat silently looking at their feet\nand thinking each one according to his nature. The Philosopher's mind,\nwhich for the past day had been in eclipse, stirred faintly to meet\nthese new circumstances, but without much result. There was a flutter at\nhis heart which was terrifying, but not unpleasant. Quickening through\nhis apprehension was an expectancy which stirred his pulses into speed.\nSo rapidly did his blood flow, so quickly were an hundred impressions\nvisualized and recorded, so violent was the surface movement of his\nbrain that he did not realize he was unable to think and that he was\nonly seeing and feeling.\n\nThe first man stood up.\n\n\"The night will be coming on soon,\" said he, \"and we had better be\nwalking on if we want to get a good place to sleep. Yep, you devil,\" he\nroared at the ass, and the ass began to move almost before he lifted his\nhead from the grass. The two men walked one on either side of the cart,\nand the woman and the Philosopher walked behind at the tail-board.\n\n\"If you were feeling tired, or anything like that, Mister Honey,\" said\nthe woman, \"you could climb up into the little cart, and nobody would\nsay a word to you, for I can see that you are not used to travelling.\"\n\n\"I am not indeed, ma'am,\" he replied; \"this is the first time I ever\ncame on a journey, and if it wasn't for Angus Og I wouldn't put a foot\nout of my own place for ever.\"\n\n\"Put Angus Og out of your head, my dear,\" she replied, \"for what would\nthe likes of you and me be saying to a god. He might put a curse on us\nwould sink us into the ground or burn us up like a grip of straw. Be\ncontented now, I'm saying, for if there is a woman in the world who\nknows all things I am that woman myself, and if you tell your trouble\nto me I'll tell you the thing to do just as good as Angus himself, and\nbetter perhaps.\"\n\n\"That is very interesting,\" said the Philosopher. \"What kind of things\ndo you know best?\"\n\n\"If you were to ask one of them two men walking beside the ass they'd\ntell you plenty of things they saw me do when they could do nothing\nthemselves. When there wasn't a road to take anywhere I showed them a\nroad, and when there wasn't a bit of food in the world I gave them food,\nand when they were bet to the last I put shillings in their hands, and\nthat's the reason they wanted to marry me.\"\n\n\"Do you call that kind of thing wisdom?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Why wouldn't I?\" said she. \"Isn't it wisdom to go through the world\nwithout fear and not to be hungry in a hungry hour?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is,\" he replied, \"but I never thought of it that way\nmyself.\"\n\n\"And what would you call wisdom?\"\n\n\"I couldn't rightly say now,\" he replied, \"but I think it was not to\nmind about the world, and not to care whether you were hungry or not,\nand not to live in the world at all but only in your own head, for the\nworld is a tyrannous place. You have to raise yourself above things\ninstead of letting things raise themselves above you. We must not be\nslaves to each other, and we must not be slaves to our necessities\neither. That is the problem of existence. There is no dignity in life at\nall if hunger can shout 'stop' at every turn of the road and the day's\njourney is measured by the distance between one sleep and the next\nsleep. Life is all slavery, and Nature is driving us with the whips of\nappetite and weariness; but when a slave rebels he ceases to be a slave,\nand when we are too hungry to live we can die and have our laugh. I\nbelieve that Nature is just as alive as we are, and that she is as\nmuch frightened of us as we are of her, and, mind you this, mankind has\ndeclared war against Nature and we will win. She does not understand\nyet that her geologic periods won't do any longer, and that while she is\npattering along the line of least resistance we are going to travel fast\nand far until we find her, and then, being a female, she is bound to\ngive in when she is challenged.\"\n\n\"It's good talk,\" said the woman, \"but it's foolishness. Women never\ngive in unless they get what they want, and where's the harm to them\nthen? You have to live in the world, my dear, whether you like it or\nnot, and, believe me now, that there isn't any wisdom but to keep clear\nof the hunger, for if that gets near enough it will make a hare of you.\nSure, listen to reason now like a good man. What is Nature at all but a\nword that learned men have made to talk about. There's clay and gods and\nmen, and they are good friends enough.\"\n\nThe sun had long since gone down, and the grey evening was bowing over\nthe land, hiding the mountain peaks, and putting a shadow round the\nscattered bushes and the wide clumps of heather.\n\n\"I know a place up here where we can stop for the night,\" said she, \"and\nthere's a little shebeen round the bend of the road where we can get\nanything we want.\"\n\nAt the word \"whoh\" the ass stopped and one of the men took the harness\noff him. When he was unyoked the man gave him two kicks: \"Be off with\nyou, you devil, and see if you can get anything to eat,\" he roared.\nThe ass trotted a few paces off and searched about until he found\nsome grass. He ate this, and when he had eaten as much as he wanted he\nreturned and lay down under a wall. He lay for a long time looking in\nthe one direction, and at last he put his head down and went to sleep.\nWhile he was sleeping he kept one ear up and the other ear down for\nabout twenty minutes, and then he put the first ear down and the other\none up, and he kept on doing this all the night. If he had anything to\nlose you wouldn't mind him setting up sentries, but he hadn't a thing\nin the world except his skin and his bones, and no one would be bothered\nstealing them.\n\nOne of the men took a long bottle out of the cart and walked up the road\nwith it. The other man lifted out a tin bucket which was punched all\nover with jagged holes. Then he took out some sods of turf and lumps of\nwood and he put these in the bucket, and in a few minutes he had a very\nnice fire lit. A pot of water was put on to boil, and the woman cut up a\ngreat lump of bacon which she put into the pot. She had eight eggs in\na place in the cart, and a flat loaf of bread, and some cold boiled\npotatoes, and she spread her apron on the ground and arranged these\nthings on it.\n\nThe other man came down the road again with his big bottle filled with\nporter, and he put this in a safe place. Then they emptied everything\nout of the cart and hoisted it over the little wall. They turned the\ncart on one side and pulled it near to the fire, and they all sat inside\nthe cart and ate their supper. When supper was done they lit their\npipes, and the woman lit a pipe also. The bottle of porter was brought\nforward, and they took drinks in turn out of the bottle, and smoked\ntheir pipes, and talked.\n\nThere was no moon that night, and no stars, so that just beyond the fire\nthere was a thick darkness which one would not like to look at, it was\nso cold and empty. While talking they all kept their eyes fixed on the\nred fire, or watched the smoke from their pipes drifting and curling\naway against the blackness, and disappearing as suddenly as lightning.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said the first man, \"what it was gave you the idea of\nmarrying this man instead of myself or my comrade, for we are young,\nhardy men, and he is getting old, God help him!\"\n\n\"Aye, indeed,\" said the second man; \"he's as grey as a badger, and\nthere's no flesh on his bones.\"\n\n\"You have a right to ask that,\" said she, \"and I'll tell you why I\ndidn't marry either of you. You are only a pair of tinkers going from\none place to another, and not knowing anything at all of fine things;\nbut himself was walking along the road looking for strange, high\nadventures, and it's a man like that a woman would be wishing to marry\nif he was twice as old as he is. When did either of you go out in the\ndaylight looking for a god and you not caring what might happen to you\nor where you went?\"\n\n\"What I'm thinking,\" said the second man, \"is that if you leave the gods\nalone they'll leave you alone. It's no trouble to them to do whatever is\nright themselves, and what call would men like us have to go mixing or\nmeddling with their high affairs?\"\n\n\"I thought all along that you were a timid man,\" said she, \"and now I\nknow it.\" She turned again to the Philosopher--\"Take off your boots,\nMister Honey, the way you'll rest easy, and I'll be making down a soft\nbed for you in the cart.\"\n\nIn order to take off his boots the Philosopher had to stand up, for in\nthe cart they were too cramped for freedom. He moved backwards a space\nfrom the fire and took off his boots. He could see the woman stretching\nsacks and clothes inside the cart, and the two men smoking quietly and\nhanding the big bottle from one to the other. Then in his stockinged\nfeet he stepped a little farther from the fire, and, after another look,\nhe turned and walked quietly away into the blackness. In a few minutes\nhe heard a shout from behind him, and then a number of shouts and then\nthese died away into a plaintive murmur of voices, and next he was alone\nin the greatest darkness he had ever known.\n\nHe put on his boots and walked onwards. He had no idea where the road\nlay, and every moment he stumbled into a patch of heather or prickly\nfurze. The ground was very uneven with unexpected mounds and deep\nhollows: here and there were water-soaked, soggy places, and into these\ncold ruins he sank ankle deep. There was no longer an earth or a sky,\nbut only a black void and a thin wind and a fierce silence which seemed\nto listen to him as he went. Out of that silence a thundering laugh\nmight boom at an instant and stop again while he stood appalled in the\nblind vacancy.\n\nThe hill began to grow more steep and rocks were lying everywhere in his\npath. He could not see an inch in front, and so he went with his hands\nout-stretched like a blind man who stumbles painfully along. After a\ntime he was nearly worn out with cold and weariness, but he dared not\nsit down anywhere; the darkness was so intense that it frightened him,\nand the overwhelming, crafty silence frightened him also.\n\nAt last, and at a great distance, he saw a flickering, waving light, and\nhe went towards this through drifts of heather, and over piled rocks and\nsodden bogland. When he came to the light he saw it was a torch of thick\nbranches, the flame whereof blew hither and thither on the wind. The\ntorch was fastened against a great cliff of granite by an iron band. At\none side there was a dark opening in the rock, so he said: \"I will go\nin there and sleep until the morning comes,\" and he went in. At a very\nshort distance the cleft turned again to the right, and here there was\nanother torch fixed. When he turned this corner he stood for an instant\nin speechless astonishment, and then he covered his face and bowed down\nupon the ground.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III. THE TWO GODS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nCAITILIN NI MURRACHU was sitting alone in the little cave behind Gort na\nCloca Mora. Her companion had gone out as was his custom to walk in the\nsunny morning and to sound his pipe in desolate, green spaces whence,\nperhaps, the wanderer of his desire might hear the guiding sweetness. As\nshe sat she was thinking. The last few days had awakened her body, and\nhad also awakened her mind, for with the one awakening comes the other.\nThe despondency which had touched her previously when tending her\nfather's cattle came to her again, but recognizably now. She knew the\nthing which the wind had whispered in the sloping field and for which\nshe had no name--it was Happiness. Faintly she shadowed it forth,\nbut yet she could not see it. It was only a pearl-pale wraith, almost\nformless, too tenuous to be touched by her hands, and too aloof to be\nspoken to. Pan had told her that he was the giver of happiness, but he\nhad given her only unrest and fever and a longing which could not be\nsatisfied. Again there was a want, and she could not formulate, or\neven realize it with any closeness. Her new-born Thought had promised\neverything, even as Pan, and it had given--she could not say that it had\ngiven her nothing or anything. Its limits were too quickly divinable.\nShe had found the Tree of Knowledge, but about on every side a great\nwall soared blackly enclosing her in from the Tree of Life--a wall which\nher thought was unable to surmount even while instinct urged that\nit must topple before her advance; but instinct may not advance when\nthought has schooled it in the science of unbelief; and this wall will\nnot be conquered until Thought and Instinct are wed, and the first son\nof that bridal will be called The Scaler of the Wall.\n\nSo, after the quiet weariness of ignorance, the unquiet weariness\nof thought had fallen upon her. That travail of mind which, through\ncountless generations, has throed to the birth of an ecstasy, the\nprophecy which humanity has sworn must be fulfilled, seeing through\nwhatever mists and doubtings the vision of a gaiety wherein the\ninnocence of the morning will not any longer be strange to our maturity.\n\nWhile she was so thinking Pan returned, a little disheartened that he\nhad found no person to listen to his pipings. He had been seated but a\nlittle time when suddenly, from without, a chorus of birds burst into\njoyous singing. Limpid and liquid cadenzas, mellow flutings, and the\nsweet treble of infancy met and danced and piped in the airy soundings.\nA round, soft tenderness of song rose and fell, broadened and soared,\nand then the high flight was snatched, eddied a moment, and was borne\naway to a more slender and wonderful loftiness, until, from afar, that\nthrilling song turned on the very apex of sweetness, dipped steeply and\nflashed its joyous return to the exultations of its mates below, rolling\nan ecstasy of song which for one moment gladdened the whole world and\nthe sad people who moved thereon; then the singing ceased as suddenly\nas it began, a swift shadow darkened the passage, and Angus Og came into\nthe cave.\n\nCaitilin sprang from her seat Frighted, and Pan also made a half\nmovement towards rising, but instantly sank back again to his negligent,\neasy posture.\n\nThe god was slender and as swift as a wind. His hair swung about his\nface like golden blossoms. His eyes were mild and dancing and his lips\nsmiled with quiet sweetness. About his head there flew perpetually a\nring of singing birds, and when he spoke his voice came sweetly from a\ncentre of sweetness.\n\n\"Health to you, daughter of Murrachu,\" said he, and he sat down.\n\n\"I do not know you, sir,\" the terrified girl whispered.\n\n\"I cannot be known until I make myself known,\" he replied. \"I am called\nInfinite Joy, O daughter of Murrachu, and I am called Love.\"\n\nThe girl gazed doubtfully from one to the other.\n\nPan looked up from his pipes.\n\n\"I also am called Love,\" said he gently, \"and I am called Joy.\"\n\nAngus Og looked for the first time at Pan.\n\n\"Singer of the Vine,\" said he, \"I know your names-they are Desire and\nFever and Lust and Death. Why have you come from your own place to spy\nupon my pastures and my quiet fields?\"\n\nPan replied mildly.\n\n\"The mortal gods move by the Immortal Will, and, therefore, I am here.\"\n\n\"And I am here,\" said Angus.\n\n\"Give me a sign,\" said Pan, \"that I must go.\"\n\nAngus Og lifted his hand and from without there came again the\ntriumphant music of the birds.\n\n\"It is a sign,\" said he, \"the voice of Dana speaking in the air,\" and,\nsaying so, he made obeisance to the great mother.\n\nPan lifted his hand, and from afar there came the lowing of the cattle\nand the thin voices of the goats.\n\n\"It is a sign,\" said he, \"the voice of Demeter speaking from the earth,\"\nand he also bowed deeply to the mother of the world.\n\nAgain Angus Og lifted his hand, and in it there appeared a spear, bright\nand very terrible.\n\nBut Pan only said, \"Can a spear divine the Eternal Will?\" and Angus Og\nput his weapon aside, and he said: \"The girl will choose between us, for\nthe Divine Mood shines in the heart of man.\"\n\nThen Caitilin Ni Murrachu came forward and sat between the gods, but\nPan stretched out his hand and drew her to him, so that she sat resting\nagainst his shoulder and his arm was about her body.\n\n\"We will speak the truth to this girl,\" said Angus Og.\n\n\"Can the gods speak otherwise?\" said Pan, and he laughed with delight.\n\n\"It is the difference between us,\" replied Angus Og. \"She will judge.\"\n\n\"Shepherd Girl,\" said Pan, pressing her with his arm, \"you will\njudge between us. Do you know what is the greatest thing in the\nworld?--because it is of that you will have to judge.\"\n\n\"I have heard,\" the girl replied, \"two things called the greatest\nthings. You,\" she continued to Pan, \"said it was Hunger, and long ago my\nfather said that Commonsense was the greatest thing in the world.\"\n\n\"I have not told you,\" said Angus Og, \"what I consider is the greatest\nthing in the world.\"\n\n\"It is your right to speak,\" said Pan.\n\n\"The greatest thing in the world,\" said Angus Og, \"is the Divine\nImagination.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Pan, \"we know all the greatest things and we can talk of\nthem.\"\n\n\"The daughter of Murrachu,\" continued Angus Og, \"has told us what you\nthink and what her father thinks, but she has not told us what she\nthinks herself. Tell us, Caitilin Ni Murrachu, what you think is the\ngreatest thing in the world.\"\n\nSo Caitilin Ni Murrachu thought for a few moments and then replied\ntimidly.\n\n\"I think that Happiness is the greatest thing in the world,\" said she.\n\nHearing this they sat in silence for a little time, and then Angus\nOg spoke again \"The Divine Imagination may only be known through the\nthoughts of His creatures. A man has said Commonsense and a woman has\nsaid Happiness are the greatest things in the world. These things are\nmale and female, for Commonsense is Thought and Happiness is Emotion,\nand until they embrace in Love the will of Immensity cannot be fruitful.\nFor, behold, there has been no marriage of humanity since time began.\nMen have but coupled with their own shadows. The desire that sprang from\ntheir heads they pursued, and no man has yet known the love of a woman.\nAnd women have mated with the shadows of their own hearts, thinking\nfondly that the arms of men were about them. I saw my son dancing with\nan Idea, and I said to him, 'With what do you dance, my son?' and he\nreplied, 'I make merry with the wife of my affection,' and truly she was\nshaped as a woman is shaped, but it was an Idea he danced with and not\na woman. And presently he went away to his labours, and then his Idea\narose and her humanity came upon her so that she was clothed with beauty\nand terror, and she went apart and danced with the servant of my son,\nand there was great joy of that dancing--for a person in the wrong place\nis an Idea and not a person. Man is Thought and woman is Intuition, and\nthey have never mated. There is a gulf between them and it is called\nFear, and what they fear is, that their strengths shall be taken from\nthem and they may no longer be tyrants. The Eternal has made love blind,\nfor it is not by science, but by intuition alone, that he may come to\nhis beloved; but desire, which is science, has many eyes and sees so\nvastly that he passes his love in the press, saying there is no love,\nand he propagates miserably on his own delusions. The finger-tips are\nguided by God, but the devil looks through the eyes of all creatures so\nthat they may wander in the errors of reason and justify themselves\nof their wanderings. The desire of a man shall be Beauty, but he has\nfashioned a slave in his mind and called it Virtue. The desire of a\nwoman shall be Wisdom, but she has formed a beast in her blood and\ncalled it Courage: but the real virtue is courage, and the real courage\nis liberty, and the real liberty is wisdom, and Wisdom is the son of\nThought and Intuition; and his names also are Innocence and Adoration\nand Happiness.\"\n\nWhen Angus Og had said these words he ceased, and for a time there was\nsilence in the little cave. Caitilin had covered her face with her hands\nand would not look at him, but Pan drew the girl closer to his side and\npeered sideways, laughing at Angus.\n\n\"Has the time yet come for the girl to judge between us?\" said he.\n\n\"Daughter of Murrachu,\" said Angus Og, \"will you come away with me from\nthis place?\"\n\nCaitilin then looked at the god in great distress. \"I do not know what\nto do,\" said she. \"Why do you both want me? I have given myself to Pan,\nand his arms are about me.\"\n\n\"I want you,\" said Angus Og, \"because the world has forgotten me. In all\nmy nation there is no remembrance of me. I, wandering on the hills of my\ncountry, am lonely indeed. I am the desolate god forbidden to utter\nmy happy laughter. I hide the silver of my speech and the gold of my\nmerriment. I live in the holes of the rocks and the dark caves of the\nsea. I weep in the morning because I may not laugh, and in the evening I\ngo abroad and am not happy. Where I have kissed a bird has flown; where\nI have trod a flower has sprung. But Thought has snared my birds in\nhis nets and sold them in the market-places. Who will deliver me from\nThought, from the base holiness of Intellect, the maker of chains\nand traps? Who will save me from the holy impurity of Emotion, whose\ndaughters are Envy and Jealousy and Hatred, who plucks my flowers to\nornament her lusts and my little leaves to shrivel on the breasts of\ninfamy? Lo, I am sealed in the caves of nonentity until the head and the\nheart shall come together in fruitfulness, until Thought has wept for\nLove, and Emotion has purified herself to meet her lover. Tirna-nog is\nthe heart of a man and the head of a woman. Widely they are separated.\nSelf-centred they stand, and between them the seas of space are flooding\ndesolately. No voice can shout across those shores. No eye can bridge\nthem, nor any desire bring them together until the blind god shall find\nthem on the wavering stream--not as an arrow searches straightly from\na bow, but gently, imperceptibly as a feather on the wind reaches the\nground on a hundred starts; not with the compass and the chart, but by\nthe breath of the Almighty which blows from all quarters without care\nand without ceasing. Night and day it urges from the outside to the\ninside. It gathers ever to the centre. From the far without to the deep\nwithin, trembling from the body to the soul until the head of a woman\nand the heart of a man are filled with the Divine Imagination. Hymen,\nHymenaea! I sing to the ears that are stopped, the eyes that are sealed,\nand the minds that do not labour. Sweetly I sing on the hillside. The\nblind shall look within and not without; the deaf shall hearken to\nthe murmur of their own veins, and be enchanted with the wisdom of\nsweetness; the thoughtless shall think without effort as the lightning\nflashes, that the hand of Innocence may reach to the stars, that the\nfeet of Adoration may dance to the Father of Joy, and the laugh of\nHappiness be answered by the Voice of Benediction.\"\n\nThus Angus Og sang in the cave, and ere he had ceased Caitilin Ni\nMurrachu withdrew herself from the arms of her desires. But so strong\nwas the hold of Pan upon her that when she was free her body bore the\nmarks of his grip, and many days passed away before these marks faded.\n\nThen Pan arose in silence, taking his double reed in his hand, and the\ngirl wept, beseeching him to stay to be her brother and the brother of\nher beloved, but Pan smiled and said: \"Your beloved is my father and\nmy son. He is yesterday and to-morrow. He is the nether and the upper\nmillstone, and I am crushed between until I kneel again before the\nthrone from whence I came,\" and, saying so, he embraced Angus Og most\ntenderly and went his way to the quiet fields, and across the slopes of\nthe mountains, and beyond the blue distances of space.\n\nAnd in a little time Caitilin Ni Murrachu went with her companion\nacross the brow of the hill, and she did not go with him because she had\nunderstood his words, nor because he was naked and unashamed, but only\nbecause his need of her was very great, and, therefore, she loved\nhim, and stayed his feet in the way, and was concerned lest he should\nstumble.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV. THE PHILOSOPHER'S RETURN\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nWHICH is, the Earth or the creatures that move upon it, the more\nimportant? This is a question prompted solely by intellectual arrogance,\nfor in life there is no greater and no less. The thing that is has\njustified its own importance by mere existence, for that is the great\nand equal achievement. If life were arranged for us from without such a\nquestion of supremacy would assume importance, but life is always from\nwithin, and is modified or extended by our own appetites, aspirations,\nand central activities. From without we get pollen and the refreshment\nof space and quietude--it is sufficient. We might ask, is the Earth\nanything more than an extension of our human consciousness, or are we,\nmoving creatures, only projections of the Earth's antennae? But these\nmatters have no value save as a field wherein Thought, like a wise lamb,\nmay frolic merrily. And all would be very well if Thought would but\ncontinue to frolic, instead of setting up first as locum tenens for\nIntuition and sticking to the job, and afterwards as the counsel and\ncritic of Omnipotence. Everything has two names, and everything is\ntwofold. The name of male Thought as it faces the world is Philosophy,\nbut the name it bears in Tirna-nog is Delusion. Female Thought is called\nSocialism on earth, but in Eternity it is known as Illusion; and this\nis so because there has been no matrimony of minds, but only an\nhermaphroditic propagation of automatic ideas, which in their due\nrotation assume dominance and reign severely. To the world this system\nof thought, because it is consecutive, is known as Logic, but Eternity\nhas written it down in the Book of Errors as Mechanism: for life may not\nbe consecutive, but explosive and variable, else it is a shackled and\ntimorous slave.\n\nOne of the great troubles of life is that Reason has taken charge of the\nadministration of Justice, and by mere identification it has achieved\nthe crown and sceptre of its master. But the imperceptible usurpation\nwas recorded, and discriminating minds understand the chasm which still\ndivides the pretender Law from the exiled King. In a like manner, and\nwith feigned humility, the Cold Demon advanced to serve Religion, and by\nguile and violence usurped her throne; but the pure in heart still fly\nfrom the spectre Theology to dance in ecstasy before the starry and\neternal goddess. Statecraft, also, that tender Shepherd of the Flocks,\nhas been despoiled of his crook and bell, and wanders in unknown\ndesolation while, beneath the banner of Politics, Reason sits howling\nover an intellectual chaos.\n\nJustice is the maintaining of equilibrium. The blood of Cain must cry,\nnot from the lips of the Avenger, but from the aggrieved Earth herself\nwho demands that atonement shall be made for a disturbance of her\nconsciousness. All justice is, therefore, readjustment. A thwarted\nconsciousness has every right to clamour for assistance, but not for\npunishment. This latter can only be sought by timorous and egotistic\nIntellect, which sees the Earth from which it has emerged and into which\nit must return again in its own despite, and so, being self-centred and\nenvious and a renegade from life, Reason is more cruelly unjust, and\nmore timorous than any other manifestation of the divinely erratic\nenergy--erratic, because, as has been said, \"the crooked roads are the\nroads of genius.\" Nature grants to all her creatures an unrestricted\nliberty, quickened by competitive appetite, to succeed or to fail; save\nonly to Reason, her Demon of Order, which can do neither, and\nwhose wings she has clipped for some reason with which I am not yet\nacquainted. It may be that an unrestricted mentality would endanger\nher own intuitive perceptions by shackling all her other organs of\nperception, or annoy her by vexatious efforts at creative rivalry.\n\nIt will, therefore, be understood that when the Leprecauns of Gort\nna Cloca Mora acted in the manner about to be recorded, they were not\nprompted by any lewd passion for revenge, but were merely striving to\nreconstruct a rhythm which was their very existence, and which must have\nbeen of direct importance to the Earth. Revenge is the vilest passion\nknown to life. It has made Law possible, and by doing so it gave\nto Intellect the first grip at that universal dominion which is its\nambition. A Leprecaun is of more value to the Earth than is a Prime\nMinister or a stockbroker, because a Leprecaun dances and makes\nmerry, while a Prime Minister knows nothing of these natural\nvirtues--consequently, an injury done to a Leprecaun afflicts the\nEarth with misery, and justice is, for these reasons, an imperative and\nmomentous necessity.\n\nA community of Leprecauns without a crock of gold is a blighted and\nmerriless community, and they are certainly justified in seeking\nsympathy and assistance for the recovery of so essential a treasure. But\nthe steps whereby the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca Mora sought to regain\ntheir property must for ever brand their memory with a certain odium.\nIt should be remembered in their favour that they were cunningly and\ncruelly encompassed. Not only was their gold stolen, but it was buried\nin such a position as placed it under the protection of their own\ncommunal honour, and the household of their enemy was secured against\ntheir active and righteous malice, because the Thin Woman of Inis\nMagrath belonged to the most powerful Shee of Ireland. It is in\ncircumstances such as these that dangerous alliances are made, and,\nfor the first time in history, the elemental beings invoked bourgeois\nassistance.\n\nThey were loath to do it, and justice must record the fact. They\nwere angry when they did it, and anger is both mental and intuitive\nblindness. It is not the beneficent blindness which prevents one from\nseeing without, but it is that desperate darkness which cloaks the\nwithin, and hides the heart and the brain from each other's husbandry\nand wifely recognition. But even those mitigating circumstances cannot\njustify the course they adopted, and the wider idea must be sought for,\nthat out of evil good must ultimately come, or else evil is vitiated\nbeyond even the redemption of usage. When they were able to realize of\nwhat they had been guilty, they were very sorry indeed, and endeavoured\nto publish their repentance in many ways; but, lacking atonement,\nrepentance is only a post-mortem virtue which is good for nothing but\nburial.\n\nWhen the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca Mora found they were unable\nto regain their crock of gold by any means they laid an anonymous\ninformation at the nearest Police Station showing that two dead bodies\nwould be found under the hearthstone in the hut of Coille Doraca, and\nthe inference to be drawn from their crafty missive was that\nthese bodies had been murdered by the Philosopher for reasons very\ndiscreditable to him.\n\nThe Philosopher had been scarcely more than three hours on his journey\nto Angus Og when four policemen approached the little house from as many\ndifferent directions, and without any trouble they effected an entrance.\nThe Thin Woman of Inis Magrath and the two children heard from afar\ntheir badly muffled advance, and on discovering the character of their\nvisitors they concealed themselves among the thickly clustering trees.\nShortly after the men had entered the hut loud and sustained noises\nbegan to issue therefrom, and in about twenty minutes the invaders\nemerged again bearing the bodies of the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin and her\nhusband. They wrenched the door off its hinges, and, placing the bodies\non the door, proceeded at a rapid pace through the trees and disappeared\nin a short time. When they had departed the Thin Woman and the children\nreturned to their home and over the yawning hearth the Thin Woman\npronounced a long and fervid malediction wherein policemen were\nexhibited naked before the blushes of Eternity...\n\nWith your good-will let us now return to the Philosopher.\n\nFollowing his interview with Angus Og the Philosopher received the\nblessing of the god and returned on his homeward journey. When he left\nthe cave he had no knowledge where he was nor whether he should turn to\nthe right hand or to the left. This alone was his guiding idea, that as\nhe had come up the mountain on his first journey his home-going must, by\nmere opposition, be down the mountain, and, accordingly, he set his\nface downhill and trod lustily forward. He had stamped up the hill with\nvigour, he strode down it in ecstasy. He tossed his voice on every wind\nthat went by. From the wells of forgetfulness he regained the shining\nwords and gay melodies which his childhood had delighted in, and these\nhe sang loudly and unceasingly as he marched. The sun had not yet\nrisen but, far away, a quiet brightness was creeping over the sky. The\ndaylight, however, was near the full, one slender veil only remaining of\nthe shadows, and a calm, unmoving quietude brooded from the grey sky to\nthe whispering earth. The birds had begun to bestir themselves but not\nto sing. Now and again a solitary wing feathered the chill air; but for\nthe most part the birds huddled closer in the swinging nests, or under\nthe bracken, or in the tufty grass. Here a faint twitter was heard and\nceased. A little farther a drowsy voice called \"cheep-cheep\" and turned\nagain to the warmth of its wing. The very grasshoppers were silent. The\ncreatures who range in the night time had returned to their cells and\nwere setting their households in order, and those who belonged to the\nday hugged their comfort for but one minute longer. Then the first level\nbeam stepped like a mild angel to the mountain top. The slender radiance\nbrightened and grew strong. The grey veil faded away. The birds leaped\nfrom their nests. The grasshoppers awakened and were busy at a stroke.\nVoice called to voice without ceasing, and, momently, a song thrilled\nfor a few wide seconds. But for the most part it was chatter-chatter\nthey went as they soared and plunged and swept, each bird eager for its\nbreakfast.\n\nThe Philosopher thrust his hand into his wallet and found there the last\nbroken remnants of his cake, and the instant his hand touched the food\nhe was seized by a hunger so furious that he sat down where he stopped\nand prepared to eat.\n\nThe place where he sat was a raised bank under a hedge, and this place\ndirectly fronted a clumsy wooden gate leading into a great field. When\nthe Philosopher had seated himself he raised his eyes and saw through\nthe gate a small company approaching. There were four men and three\nwomen, and each of them carried a metal pail. The Philosopher with a\nsigh returned the cake to his wallet, saying:\n\n\"All men are brothers, and it may be that these people are as hungry as\nI am.\"\n\nIn a short time the strangers came near. The foremost of them was a huge\nman who was bearded to the eyelids and who moved like a strong wind. He\nopened the gate by removing a piece of wood wherewith it was jammed, and\nhe and his companions passed through, whereupon he closed the gate\nand secured it. To this man, as being the eldest, the Philosopher\napproached.\n\n\"I am about to breakfast,\" said he, \"and if you are hungry perhaps you\nwould like to eat with me.\"\n\n\"Why not,\" said the man, \"for the person who would refuse a kind\ninvitation is a dog. These are my three sons and three of my daughters,\nand we are all thankful to you.\"\n\nSaying this he sat down on the bank and his companions, placing their\npails behind them, did likewise. The Philosopher divided his cake into\neight pieces and gave one to each person.\n\n\"I am sorry it is so little,\" said he.\n\n\"A gift,\" said the bearded man, \"is never little,\" and he courteously\nate his piece in three bites although he could have easily eaten it in\none, and his children also.\n\n\"That was a good, satisfying cake,\" said he when he had finished;\n\"it was well baked and well shared, but,\" he continued, \"I am in a\ndifficulty and maybe you could advise me what to do, sir?\"\n\n\"What might be your trouble?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"It is this,\" said the man. \"Every morning when we go out to milk the\ncows the mother of my clann gives to each of us a parcel of food so that\nwe need not be any hungrier than we like; but now we have had a good\nbreakfast with you, what shall we do with the food that we brought with\nus? The woman of the house would not be pleased if we carried it back\nto her, and if we threw food away it would be a sin. If it was not\ndisrespectful to your breakfast the boys and girls here might be able\nto get rid of it by eating it, for, as you know, young people can always\neat a bit more, no matter how much they have already eaten.\"\n\n\"It would surely be better to eat it than to waste it,\" said the\nPhilosopher wistfully.\n\nThe young people produced large parcels of food from their pockets and\nopened them, and the bearded man said, \"I have a little one myself also,\nand it would not be wasted if you were kind enough to help me to eat\nit,\" and he pulled out his parcel, which was twice as big as any of the\nothers.\n\nHe opened the parcel and handed the larger part of its contents to the\nPhilosopher; he then plunged a tin vessel into one of the milk pails and\nset this also by the Philosopher, and, instantly, they all began to eat\nwith furious appetite.\n\nWhen the meal was finished the Philosopher filled his tobacco pipe and\nthe bearded man and his three sons did likewise.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the bearded man, \"I would be glad to know why you are\ntravelling abroad so early in the morning, for, at this hour, no one\nstirs but the sun and the birds and the folk who, like ourselves, follow\nthe cattle?\"\n\n\"I will tell you that gladly,\" said the Philosopher, \"if you will tell\nme your name.\"\n\n\"My name,\" said the bearded man, \"is Mac Cul.\"\n\n\"Last night,\" said the Philosopher, \"when I came from the house of Angus\nOg in the Caves of the Sleepers of Erinn I was bidden say to a man named\nMac Cul-that the horses had trampled in their sleep and the sleepers had\nturned on their sides.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the bearded man, \"your words thrill in my heart like music,\nbut my head does not understand them.\"\n\n\"I have learned,\" said the Philosopher, \"that the head does not hear\nanything until the heart has listened, and that what the heart knows\nto-day the head will understand to-morrow.\"\n\n\"All the birds of the world are singing in my soul,\" said the bearded\nman, \"and I bless you because you have filled me with hope and pride.\"\n\nSo the Philosopher shook him by the hand, and he shook the hands of his\nsons and daughters who bowed before him at the mild command of their\nfather, and when he had gone a little way he looked around again and\nhe saw that group of people standing where he had left them, and the\nbearded man was embracing his children on the highroad.\n\nA bend in the path soon shut them from view, and then the Philosopher,\nfortified by food and the freshness of the morning, strode onwards\nsinging for very joy. It was still early, but now the birds had eaten\ntheir breakfasts and were devoting themselves to each other. They rested\nside by side on the branches of the trees and on the hedges, they danced\nin the air in happy brotherhoods and they sang to one another amiable\nand pleasant ditties.\n\nWhen the Philosopher had walked for a long time he felt a little weary\nand sat down to refresh himself in the shadow of a great tree. Hard by\nthere was a house of rugged stone. Long years ago it had been a castle,\nand, even now, though patched by time and misfortune its front was\nwarlike and frowning. While he sat a young woman came along the road and\nstood gazing earnestly at this house. Her hair was as black as night and\nas smooth as still water, but her face came so stormily forward that her\nquiet attitude had yet no quietness in it. To her, after a few moments,\nthe Philosopher spoke.\n\n\"Girl,\" said he, \"why do you look so earnestly at the house?\"\n\nThe girl turned her pale face and stared at him.\n\n\"I did not notice you sitting under the tree,\" said she, and she came\nslowly forward.\n\n\"Sit down by me,\" said the Philosopher, \"and we will talk. If you are in\nany trouble tell it to me, and perhaps you will talk the heaviest part\naway.\"\n\n\"I will sit beside you willingly,\" said the girl, and she did so.\n\n\"It is good to talk trouble over,\" he continued. \"Do you know that\ntalk is a real thing? There is more power in speech than many people\nconceive. Thoughts come from God, they are born through the marriage\nof the head and the lungs. The head moulds the thought into the form of\nwords, then it is borne and sounded on the air which has been already in\nthe secret kingdoms of the body, which goes in bearing life and come out\nfreighted with wisdom. For this reason a lie is very terrible, because\nit is turning mighty and incomprehensible things to base uses, and is\nburdening the life-giving element with a foul return for its goodness;\nbut those who speak the truth and whose words are the symbols of wisdom\nand beauty, these purify the whole world and daunt contagion. The only\ntrouble the body can know is disease. All other miseries come from the\nbrain, and, as these belong to thought, they can be driven out by their\nmaster as unruly and unpleasant vagabonds; for a mental trouble should\nbe spoken to, confronted, reprimanded and so dismissed. The brain cannot\nafford to harbour any but pleasant and eager citizens who will do their\npart in making laughter and holiness for the world, for that is the duty\nof thought.\"\n\nWhile the Philosopher spoke the girl had been regarding him steadfastly.\n\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"we tell our hearts to a young man and our heads to an\nold man, and when the heart is a fool the head is bound to be a liar.\nI can tell you the things I know, but how will I tell you the things I\nfeel when I myself do not understand them? If I say these words to you\n'I love a man' I do not say anything at all, and you do not hear one\nof the words which my heart is repeating over and over to itself in the\nsilence of my body. Young people are fools in their heads and old people\nare fools in their hearts, and they can only look at each other and pass\nby in wonder.\"\n\n\"You are wrong,\" said the Philosopher. \"An old person can take your hand\nlike this and say, 'May every good thing come to you, my daughter.' For\nall trouble there is sympathy, and for love there is memory, and these\nare the head and the heart talking to each other in quiet friendship.\nWhat the heart knows to-day the head will understand to-morrow, and\nas the head must be the scholar of the heart it is necessary that our\nhearts be purified and free from every false thing, else we are tainted\nbeyond personal redemption.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the girl, \"I know of two great follies-they are love and\nspeech, for when these are given they can never be taken back again, and\nthe person to whom these are given is not any richer, but the giver is\nmade poor and abashed. I gave my love to a man who did not want it.\nI told him of my love, and he lifted his eyelids at me; that is my\ntrouble.\"\n\nFor a moment the Philosopher sat in stricken silence looking on the\nground. He had a strange disinclination to look at the girl although he\nfelt her eyes fixed steadily on him. But in a little while he did look\nat her and spoke again.\n\n\"To carry gifts to an ungrateful person cannot be justified and need not\nbe mourned for. If your love is noble why do you treat it meanly? If it\nis lewd the man was right to reject it.\"\n\n\"We love as the wind blows,\" she replied.\n\n\"There is a thing,\" said the Philosopher, \"and it is both the biggest\nand the littlest thing in the world.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" said the girl.\n\n\"It is pride,\" he answered. \"It lives in an empty house. The head which\nhas never been visited by the heart is the house pride lives in. You\nare in error, my dear, and not in love. Drive out the knave pride, put a\nflower in your hair and walk freely again.\"\n\nThe girl laughed, and suddenly her pale face became rosy as the dawn and\nas radiant and lovely as a cloud. She shed warmth and beauty about her\nas she leaned forward.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" she whispered, \"because he does love me; but he does\nnot know it yet. He is young and full of fury, and has no time to look\nat women, but he looked at me. My heart knows it and my head knows it,\nbut I am impatient and yearn for him to look at me again. His heart will\nremember me to-morrow, and he will come searching for me with prayers\nand tears, with shouts and threats. I will be very hard to find\nto-morrow when he holds out his arms to the air and the sky, and is\nastonished and frightened to find me nowhere. I will hide from him\nto-morrow, and frown at him when he speaks, and turn aside when he\nfollows me: until the day after to-morrow when he will frighten me with\nhis anger, and hold me with his furious hands, and make me look at him.\"\n\nSaying this the girl arose and prepared to go away.\n\n\"He is in that house,\" said she, \"and I would not let him see me here\nfor anything in the world.\"\n\n\"You have wasted all my time,\" said the Philosopher, smiling.\n\n\"What else is time for?\" said the girl, and she kissed the Philosopher\nand ran swiftly down the road.\n\nShe had been gone but a few moments when a man came out of the grey\nhouse and walked quickly across the grass. When he reached the hedge\nseparating the field from the road he tossed his two arms in the air,\nswung them down, and jumped over the hedge into the roadway. He was a\nshort, dark youth, and so swift and sudden were his movements that\nhe seemed to look on every side at the one moment although he bore\nfuriously to his own direction.\n\nThe Philosopher addressed him mildly.\n\n\"That was a good jump,\" said he.\n\nThe young man spun around from where he stood, and was by the\nPhilosopher's side in an instant.\n\n\"It would be a good jump for other men,\" said he, \"but it is only a\nlittle jump for me. You are very dusty, sir; you must have travelled a\nlong distance to-day.\"\n\n\"A long distance,\" replied the Philosopher. \"Sit down here, my friend,\nand keep me company for a little time.\"\n\n\"I do not like sitting down,\" said the young man, \"but I always consent\nto a request, and I always accept friendship.\" And, so saying, he threw\nhimself down on the grass.\n\n\"Do you work in that big house?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I do,\" he replied. \"I train the hounds for a fat, jovial man, full of\nlaughter and insolence.\"\n\n\"I think you do not like your master.\"\n\n\"Believe, sir, that I do not like any master; but this man I hate. I\nhave been a week in his service, and he has not once looked on me as on\na friend. This very day, in the kennel, he passed me as though I were\na tree or a stone. I almost leaped to catch him by the throat and say:\n'Dog, do you not salute your fellow-man?' But I looked after him and let\nhim go, for it would be an unpleasant thing to strangle a fat person.\"\n\n\"If you are displeased with your master should you not look for another\noccupation?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I was thinking of that, and I was thinking whether I ought to kill him\nor marry his daughter. She would have passed me by as her father did,\nbut I would not let a woman do that to me: no man would.\"\n\n\"What did you do to her?\" said the Philosopher.\n\nThe young man chuckled \"I did not look at her the first time, and when\nshe came near me the second time I looked another way, and on the third\nday she spoke to me, and while she stood I looked over her shoulder\ndistantly. She said she hoped I would be happy in my new home, and she\nmade her voice sound pleasant while she said it; but I thanked her and\nturned away carelessly.\"\n\n\"Is the girl beautiful?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I do not know,\" he replied; \"I have not looked at her yet, although\nnow I see her everywhere. I think she is a woman who would annoy me if I\nmarried her.\"\n\n\"If you haven't seen her, how can you think that?\"\n\n\"She has tame feet,\" said the youth. \"I looked at them and they got\nfrightened. Where have you travelled from, sir?\"\n\n\"I will tell you that,\" said the Philosopher, \"if you will tell me your\nname.\"\n\n\"It is easily told,\" he answered; \"my name is MacCulain.\"\n\n\"When I came last night,\" said the Philosopher, \"from the place of Angus\nOg in the cave of the Sleepers of Erinn I was bidden say to a man named\nMacCulain that The Grey of Macha had neighed in his sleep and the sword\nof Laeg clashed on the floor as he turned in his slumber.\"\n\nThe young man leaped from the grass.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he in a strained voice, \"I do not understand your words, but\nthey make my heart to dance and sing within me like a bird.\"\n\n\"If you listen to your heart,\" said the Philosopher, \"you will learn\nevery good thing, for the heart is the fountain of wisdom tossing its\nthoughts up to the brain which gives them form,\"--and, so saying, he\nsaluted the youth and went again on his way by the curving road.\n\nNow the day had advanced, noon was long past, and the strong sunlight\nblazed ceaselessly on the world. His path was still on the high\nmountains, running on for a short distance and twisting perpetually to\nthe right hand and to the left. One might scarcely call it a path, it\ngrew so narrow. Sometimes, indeed, it almost ceased to be a path, for\nthe grass had stolen forward inch by inch to cover up the tracks of man.\nThere were no hedges but rough, tumbled ground only, which was patched\nby trailing bushes and stretched away in mounds and hummocks beyond the\nfar horizon. There was a deep silence everywhere, not painful, for where\nthe sun shines there is no sorrow: the only sound to be heard was the\nswish of long grasses against his feet as he trod, and the buzz of an\noccasional bee that came and was gone in an instant.\n\nThe Philosopher was very hungry, and he looked about on all sides to see\nif there was anything he might eat. \"If I were a goat or a cow,\" said\nhe, \"I could eat this grass and be nourished. If I were a donkey I could\ncrop the hard thistles which are growing on every hand, or if I were\na bird I could feed on the caterpillars and creeping things which stir\ninnumerably everywhere. But a man may not eat even in the midst of\nplenty, because he has departed from nature, and lives by crafty and\ntwisted thought.\"\n\nSpeaking in this manner he chanced to lift his eyes from the ground and\nsaw, far away, a solitary figure which melted into the folding earth and\nreappeared again in a different place. So peculiar and erratic were the\nmovements of this figure that the Philosopher had great difficulty in\nfollowing it, and, indeed, would have been unable to follow, but that\nthe other chanced in his direction. When they came nearer he saw it\nwas a young boy, who was dancing hither and thither in any and every\ndirection. A bushy mound hid him for an instant, and the next they were\nstanding face to face staring at each other. After a moment's silence\nthe boy, who was about twelve years of age, and as beautiful as the\nmorning, saluted the Philosopher.\n\n\"Have you lost your way, sir?\" said he.\n\n\"All paths,\" the Philosopher replied, \"are on the earth, and so one can\nnever be lost--but I have lost my dinner.\"\n\nThe boy commenced to laugh.\n\n\"What are you laughing at, my son?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Because,\" he replied, \"I am bringing you your dinner. I wondered what\nsent me out in this direction, for I generally go more to the east.\"\n\n\"Have you got my dinner?\" said the Philosopher anxiously.\n\n\"I have,\" said the boy: \"I ate my own dinner at home, and I put your\ndinner in my pocket. I thought,\" he explained, \"that I might be hungry\nif I went far away.\"\n\n\"The gods directed you,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"They often do,\" said the boy, and he pulled a small parcel from his\npocket.\n\nThe Philosopher instantly sat down, and the boy handed him the parcel.\nHe opened this and found bread and cheese.\n\n\"It's a good dinner,\" said he, and commenced to eat.\n\n\"Would you not like a piece also, my son?\"\n\n\"I would like a little piece,\" said the boy, and he sat down before the\nPhilosopher, and they ate together happily.\n\nWhen they had finished the Philosopher praised the gods, and then said,\nmore to himself than to the boy:\n\n\"If I had a little drink of water I would want nothing else.\"\n\n\"There is a stream four paces from here,\" said his companion. \"I will\nget some water in my cap,\" and he leaped away.\n\nIn a few moments he came back holding his cap tenderly, and the\nPhilosopher took this and drank the water.\n\n\"I want nothing more in the world,\" said he, \"except to talk with you.\nThe sun is shining, the wind is pleasant, and the grass is soft. Sit\ndown beside me again for a little time.\"\n\nSo the boy sat down, and the Philosopher lit his pipe.\n\n\"Do you live far from here?\" said he.\n\n\"Not far,\" said the boy. \"You could see my mother's house from this\nplace if you were as tall as a tree, and even from the ground you can\nsee a shape of smoke yonder that floats over our cottage.\"\n\nThe Philosopher looked but could see nothing.\n\n\"My eyes are not as good as yours are,\" said he, \"because I am getting\nold.\"\n\n\"What does it feel like to be old?\" said the boy.\n\n\"It feels stiff like,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Is that all?\" said the boy.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the Philosopher replied after a few moments' silence.\n\"Can you tell me what it looks like to be young?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said the boy, and then a slight look of perplexity crossed\nhis face, and he continued, \"I don't think I can.\"\n\n\"Young people,\" said the Philosopher, \"do not know what age is, and old\npeople forget what youth was. When you begin to grow old always think\ndeeply of your youth, for an old man without memories is a wasted life,\nand nothing is worth remembering but our childhood. I will tell you some\nof the differences between being old and young, and then you can ask me\nquestions, and so we will get at both sides of the matter. First, an old\nman gets tired quicker than a boy.\"\n\nThe boy thought for a moment, and then replied:\n\n\"That is not a great difference, for a boy does get very tired.\"\n\nThe Philosopher continued:\n\n\"An old man does not want to eat as often as a boy.\"\n\n\"That is not a great difference either,\" the boy replied, \"for they both\ndo eat. Tell me the big difference.\"\n\n\"I do not know it, my son; but I have always thought there was a big\ndifference. Perhaps it is that an old man has memories of things which a\nboy cannot even guess at.\"\n\n\"But they both have memories,\" said the boy, laughing, \"and so it is not\na big difference.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the Philosopher. \"Maybe there is not so much\ndifference after all. Tell me things you do, and we will see if I can do\nthem also.\"\n\n\"But I don't know what I do,\" he replied.\n\n\"You must know the things you do,\" said the Philosopher, \"but you may\nnot understand how to put them in order. The great trouble about any\nkind of examination is to know where to begin, but there are always two\nplaces in everything with which we can commence--they are the beginning\nand the end. From either of these points a view may be had which\ncomprehends the entire period. So we will begin with the things you did\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"I am satisfied with that,\" said the boy.\n\nThe Philosopher then continued:\n\n\"When you awakened this morning and went out of the house what was the\nfirst thing you did?\"\n\nThe boy thought \"I went out, then I picked up a stone and threw it into\nthe field as far as I could.\"\n\n\"What then?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"Then I ran after the stone to see could I catch up on it before it hit\nthe ground.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"I ran so fast that I tumbled over myself into the grass.\"\n\n\"What did you do after that?\"\n\n\"I lay where I fell and plucked handfuls of the grass with both hands\nand threw them on my back.\"\n\n\"Did you get up then?\"\n\n\"No, I pressed my face into the grass and shouted a lot of times with my\nmouth against the ground, and then I sat up and did not move for a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"Were you thinking?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"No, I was not thinking or doing anything.\"\n\n\"Why did you do all these things?\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"For no reason at all,\" said the boy.\n\n\"That,\" said the Philosopher triumphantly, \"is the difference between\nage and youth. Boys do things for no reason, and old people do not.\nI wonder do we get old because we do things by reason instead of\ninstinct?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the boy, \"everything gets old. Have you travelled\nvery far to-day, sir?\"\n\n\"I will tell you that if you will tell me your name.\"\n\n\"My name,\" said the boy, \"is MacCushin.\"\n\n\"When I came last night,\" said the Philosopher, \"from the place of Angus\nOg in the Caste of the Sleepers I was bidden say to one named MacCushin\nthat a son would be born to Angus Og and his wife, Caitilin, and that\nthe sleepers of Erinn had turned in their slumbers.\"\n\nThe boy regarded him steadfastly.\n\n\"I know,\" said he, \"why Angus Og sent me that message. He wants me to\nmake a poem to the people of Erinn, so that when the Sleepers arise they\nwill meet with friends.\"\n\n\"The Sleepers have arisen,\" said the Philosopher. \"They are about us on\nevery side. They are walking now, but they have forgotten their names\nand the meanings of their names. You are to tell them their names and\ntheir lineage, for I am an old man, and my work is done.\"\n\n\"I will make a poem some day,\" said the boy, \"and every man will shout\nwhen he hears it.\"\n\n\"God be with you, my son,\" said the Philosopher, and he embraced the boy\nand went forward on his journey.\n\nAbout half an hour's easy travelling brought him to a point from which\nhe could see far down below to the pine trees of Coille Doraca. The\nshadowy evening had crept over the world ere he reached the wood, and\nwhen he entered the little house the darkness had already descended.\n\nThe Thin Woman of Inis Magrath met him as he entered, and was about to\nspeak harshly of his long absence, but the Philosopher kissed her with\nsuch unaccustomed tenderness, and spoke so mildly to her, that, first,\nastonishment enchained her tongue, and then delight set it free in a\ndirection to which it had long been a stranger.\n\n\"Wife,\" said the Philosopher, \"I cannot say how joyful I am to see your\ngood face again.\"\n\nThe Thin Woman was unable at first to reply to this salutation, but,\nwith incredible speed, she put on a pot of stirabout, began to bake a\ncake, and tried to roast potatoes. After a little while she wept loudly,\nand proclaimed that the world did not contain the equal of her husband\nfor comeliness and goodness, and that she was herself a sinful person\nunworthy of the kindness of the gods or of such a mate.\n\nBut while the Philosopher was embracing Seumas and Brigid Beg, the door\nwas suddenly burst open with a great noise, four policemen entered the\nlittle room, and after one dumbfoundered minute they retreated again\nbearing the Philosopher with them to answer a charge of murder.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V. THE POLICEMEN\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nSOME distance down the road the policemen halted. The night had fallen\nbefore they effected their capture, and now, in the gathering darkness,\nthey were not at ease. In the first place, they knew that the occupation\nupon which they were employed was not a creditable one to a man whatever\nit might be to a policeman. The seizure of a criminal may be justified\nby certain arguments as to the health of society and the preservation\nof property, but no person wishes under any circumstances to hale a wise\nman to prison. They were further distressed by the knowledge that they\nwere in the very centre of a populous fairy country, and that on every\nside the elemental hosts might be ranging, ready to fall upon them with\nthe terrors of war or the still more awful scourge of their humour.\nThe path leading to their station was a long one, winding through great\nalleys of trees, which in some places overhung the road so thickly that\neven the full moon could not search out that deep blackness. In the\ndaylight these men would have arrested an Archangel and, if necessary,\nbludgeoned him, but in the night-time a thousand fears afflicted and a\nmultitude of sounds shocked them from every quarter.\n\nTwo men were holding the Philosopher, one on either side; the other two\nwalked one before and one behind him. In this order they were proceeding\nwhen just in front through the dim light they saw the road swallowed\nup by one of these groves already spoken of. When they came nigh they\nhalted irresolutely: the man who was in front (a silent and perturbed\nsergeant) turned fiercely to the others \"Come on, can't you?\" said he;\n\"what the devil are you waiting for?\" and he strode forward into the\nblack gape.\n\n\"Keep a good hold of that man,\" said the one behind.\n\n\"Don't be talking out of you,\" replied he on the right. \"Haven't we got\na good grip of him, and isn't he an old man into the bargain?\"\n\n\"Well, keep a good tight grip of him, anyhow, for if he gave you the\nslip in there he'd vanish like a weasel in a bush. Them old fellows do\nbe slippery customers. Look here, mister,\" said he to the Philosopher,\n\"if you try to run away from us I'll give you a clout on the head with\nmy baton; do you mind me now!\"\n\nThey had taken only a few paces forward when the sound of hasty\nfootsteps brought them again to a halt, and in a moment the sergeant\ncame striding back. He was angry.\n\n\"Are you going to stay there the whole night, or what are you going to\ndo at all?\" said he.\n\n\"Let you be quiet now,\" said another; \"we were only settling with the\nman here the way he wouldn't try to give us the slip in a dark place.\"\n\n\"Is it thinking of giving us the slip he is?\" said the sergeant. \"Take\nyour baton in your hand, Shawn, and if he turns his head to one side of\nhim hit him on that side.\"\n\n\"I'll do that,\" said Shawn, and he pulled out his truncheon.\n\nThe Philosopher had been dazed by the suddenness of these occurrences,\nand the enforced rapidity of his movements prevented him from either\nthinking or speaking, but during this brief stoppage his scattered\nwits began to return to their allegiance. First, bewilderment at his\nenforcement had seized him, and the four men, who were continually\nrunning round him and speaking all at once, and each pulling him in a\ndifferent direction, gave him the impression that he was surrounded by\na great rabble of people, but he could not discover what they wanted.\nAfter a time he found that there were only four men, and gathered from\ntheir remarks that he was being arrested for murder--this precipitated\nhim into another and a deeper gulf of bewilderment. He was unable to\nconceive why they should arrest him for murder when he had not committed\nany; and, following this, he became indignant.\n\n\"I will not go another step,\" said he, \"unless you tell me where you are\nbringing me and what I am accused of.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said the sergeant, \"what did you kill them with? for it's a\nmiracle how they came to their ends without as much as a mark on their\nskins or a broken tooth itself.\"\n\n\"Who are you talking about?\" the Philosopher demanded.\n\n\"It's mighty innocent you are,\" he replied. \"Who would I be talking\nabout but the man and woman that used to be living with you beyond in\nthe little house? Is it poison you gave them now, or what was it? Take a\nhold of your note-book, Shawn.\"\n\n\"Can't you have sense, man?\" said Shawn. \"How would I be writing in the\nmiddle of a dark place and me without as much as a pencil, let alone a\nbook?\"\n\n\"Well, we'll take it down at the station, and himself can tell us\nall about it as we go along. Move on now, for this is no place to be\nconversing in.\"\n\nThey paced on again, and in another moment they were swallowed up by\nthe darkness. When they had proceeded for a little distance there came a\npeculiar sound in front like the breathing of some enormous animal, and\nalso a kind of shuffling noise, and so they again halted.\n\n\"There's a queer kind of a thing in front of us,\" said one of the men in\na low voice.\n\n\"If I had a match itself,\" said another.\n\nThe sergeant had also halted.\n\n\"Draw well into the side of the road,\" said he, \"and poke your batons in\nfront of you. Keep a tight hold of that man, Shawn.\"\n\n\"I'll do that,\" said Shawn.\n\nJust then one of them found a few matches in his pocket, and he struck a\nlight; there was no wind, so that it blazed easily enough, and they all\npeered in front. A big black cart-horse was lying in the middle of the\nroad having a gentle sleep, and when the light shone it scrambled to its\nfeet and went thundering away in a panic.\n\n\"Isn't that enough to put the heart crossways in you?\" said one of the\nmen, with a great sigh.\n\n\"Ay,\" said another; \"if you stepped on that beast in the darkness you\nwouldn't know what to be thinking.\"\n\n\"I don't quite remember the way about here,\" said the sergeant after a\nwhile, \"but I think we should take the first turn to the right. I wonder\nhave we passed the turn yet; these criss-cross kinds of roads are the\ndevil, and it dark as well. Do any of you men know the way?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said one voice; \"I'm a Cavan man myself.\"\n\n\"Roscommon,\" said another, \"is my country, and I wish I was there now,\nso I do.\"\n\n\"Well, if we walk straight on we're bound to get somewhere, so step it\nout. Have you got a good hold of that man, Shawn?\"\n\n\"I have so,\" said Shawn.\n\nThe Philosopher's voice came pealing through the darkness.\n\n\"There is no need to pinch me, sir,\" said he.\n\n\"I'm not pinching you at all,\" said the man.\n\n\"You are so,\" returned the Philosopher. \"You have a big lump of skin\ndoubled up in the sleeve of my coat, and unless you instantly release it\nI will sit down in the road.\"\n\n\"Is that any better?\" said the man, relaxing his hold a little.\n\n\"You have only let out half of it,\" replied the Philosopher. \"That's\nbetter now,\" he continued, and they resumed their journey.\n\nAfter a few minutes of silence the Philosopher began to speak.\n\n\"I do not see any necessity in nature for policemen,\" said he, \"nor do I\nunderstand how the custom first originated. Dogs and cats do not employ\nthese extraordinary mercenaries, and yet their polity is progressive\nand orderly. Crows are a gregarious race with settled habitations and an\norganized commonwealth. They usually congregate in a ruined tower or on\nthe top of a church, and their civilization is based on mutual aid and\ntolerance for each other's idiosyncrasies. Their exceeding mobility and\nhardiness renders them dangerous to attack, and thus they are free to\ndevote themselves to the development of their domestic laws and customs.\nIf policemen were necessary to a civilization crows would certainly\nhave evolved them, but I triumphantly insist that they have not got any\npolicemen in their republic--\"\n\n\"I don't understand a word you are saying,\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said the Philosopher. \"Ants and bees also live in\nspecialized communities and have an extreme complexity both of function\nand occupation. Their experience in governmental matters is enormous,\nand yet they have never discovered that a police force is at all\nessential to their wellbeing--\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said the sergeant, \"that whatever you say now will be\nused in evidence against you later on?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said the Philosopher. \"It may be said that these races are\nfree from crime, that such vices as they have are organized and communal\ninstead of individual and anarchistic, and that, consequently, there\nis no necessity for policecraft, but I cannot believe that these large\naggregations of people could have attained their present high culture\nwithout an interval of both national and individual dishonesty--\"\n\n\"Tell me now, as you are talking,\" said the sergeant, \"did you buy the\npoison at a chemist's shop, or did you smother the pair of them with a\npillow?\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said the Philosopher. \"If crime is a condition precedent to\nthe evolution of policemen, then I will submit that jackdaws are a very\nthievish clan--they are somewhat larger than a blackbird, and will\nsteal wool off a sheep's back to line their nests with; they have,\nfurthermore, been known to abstract one shilling in copper and secrete\nthis booty so ingeniously that it has never since been recovered--\"\n\n\"I had a jackdaw myself,\" said one of the men. \"I got it from a woman\nthat came to the door with a basket for fourpence. My mother stood on\nits back one day, and she getting out of bed. I split its tongue with\na threepenny bit the way it would talk, but devil the word it ever said\nfor me. It used to hop around letting on it had a lame leg, and then it\nwould steal your socks.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" roared the sergeant.\n\n\"If,\" said the Philosopher, \"these people steal both from from sheep and\nfrom men, if their peculations range from wool to money, I do not\nsee how they can avoid stealing from each other, and consequently, if\nanywhere, it is amongst jackdaws one should look for the growth of a\npolice force, but there is no such force in existence. The real reason\nis that they are a witty and thoughtful race who look temperately on\nwhat is known as crime and evil--one eats, one steals; it is all in the\norder of things, and therefore not to be quarrelled with. There is no\nother view possible to a philosophical people--\"\n\n\"What the devil is he talking about?\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"Monkeys are gregarious and thievish and semi-human. They inhabit the\nequatorial latitudes and eat nuts--\"\n\n\"Do you know what he is saying, Shawn?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said Shawn.\n\n\"--they ought to have evolved professional thief-takers, but it is common\nknowledge that they have not done so. Fishes, squirrels, rats, beavers,\nand bison have also abstained from this singular growth--therefore,\nwhen I insist that I see no necessity for policemen and object to their\npresence, I base that objection on logic and facts, and not on any\nimmediate petty prejudice.\"\n\n\"Shawn,\" said the sergeant, \"have you got a good grip on that man?\"\n\n\"I have,\" said Shawn.\n\n\"Well, if he talks any more hit him with your baton.\"\n\n\"I will so,\" said Shawn.\n\n\"There's a speck of light down yonder, and, maybe, it's a candle in a\nwindow--we'll ask the way at that place.\"\n\nIn about three minutes they came to a small house which was overhung\nby trees. If the light had not been visible they would undoubtedly have\npassed it in the darkness. As they approached the door the sound of a\nfemale voice came to them scoldingly.\n\n\"There's somebody up anyhow,\" said the sergeant, and he tapped at the\ndoor.\n\nThe scolding voice ceased instantly. After a few seconds he tapped\nagain; then a voice was heard from just behind the door.\n\n\"Tomas,\" said the voice, \"go and bring up the two dogs with you before I\ntake the door off the chain.\"\n\nThe door was then opened a few inches and a face peered out \"What would\nyou be wanting at this hour of the night?\" said the woman.\n\n\"Not much, ma'am,\" said the sergeant; \"only a little direction about the\nroad, for we are not sure whether we've gone too far or not far enough.\"\n\nThe woman noticed their uniforms.\n\n\"Is it policemen ye are? There's no harm in your coming in, I suppose,\nand if a drink of milk is any good to ye I have plenty of it.\"\n\n\"Milk's better than nothing,\" said the sergeant with a sigh.\n\n\"I've a little sup of spirits,\" said she, \"but it wouldn't be enough to\ngo around.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" said he, looking sternly at his comrades, \"everybody has to\ntake their chance in this world,\" and he stepped into the house followed\nby his men.\n\nThe women gave him a little sup of whisky from a bottle, and to each of\nthe other men she gave a cup of milk.\n\n\"It'll wash the dust out of our gullets, anyhow,\" said one of them.\n\nThere were two chairs, a bed, and a table in the room. The Philosopher\nand his attendants sat on the bed. The sergeant sat on the table,\nthe fourth man took a chair, and the woman dropped wearily into the\nremaining chair from which she looked with pity at the prisoner.\n\n\"What are you taking the poor man away for?\" she asked.\n\n\"He's a bad one, ma'am,\" said the sergeant. \"He killed a man and a woman\nthat were staying with him and he buried their corpses underneath the\nhearthstone of his house. He's a real malefactor, mind you.\"\n\n\"Is it hanging him you'll be, God help us?\"\n\n\"You never know, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it came to\nthat. But you were in trouble yourself, ma'am, for we heard your voice\nlamenting about something as we came along the road.\"\n\n\"I was, indeed,\" she replied, \"for the person that has a son in her\nhouse has a trouble in her heart.\"\n\n\"Do you tell me now--What did he do on you?\" and the sergeant bent a\nlook of grave reprobation on a young lad who was standing against the\nwall between two dogs.\n\n\"He's a good boy enough in some ways,\" said she, \"but he's too fond\nof beasts. He'll go and lie in the kennel along with them two dogs for\nhours at a time, petting them and making a lot of them, but if I try\nto give him a kiss, or to hug him for a couple of minutes when I do be\ntired after the work, he'll wriggle like an eel till I let him out--it\nwould make a body hate him, so it would. Sure, there's no nature in him,\nsir, and I'm his mother.\"\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you young whelp,\" said the\nsergeant very severely.\n\n\"And then there's the horse,\" she continued. \"Maybe you met it down the\nroad a while ago?\"\n\n\"We did, ma'am,\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"Well, when he came in Tomas went to tie him up, for he's a caution at\ngetting out and wandering about the road, the way you'd break your neck\nover him if you weren't minding. After a while I told the boy to come\nin, but he didn't come, so I went out myself, and there was himself and\nthe horse with their arms round each other's necks looking as if they\nwere moonstruck.\"\n\n\"Faith, he's the queer lad!\" said the sergeant. \"What do you be making\nlove to the horse for, Tomas?\"\n\n\"It was all I could do to make him come in,\" she continued, \"and then I\nsaid to him, 'Sit down alongside of me here, Tomas, and keep me company\nfor a little while'--for I do be lonely in the night-time--but he\nwouldn't stay quiet at all. One minute he'd say, 'Mother, there's a moth\nflying round the candle and it'll be burnt,' and then, 'There was a fly\ngoing into the spider's web in the corner,' and he'd have to save\nit, and after that, 'There's a daddy-long-legs hurting himself on the\nwindow-pane,' and he'd have to let it out; but when I try to kiss him he\npushes me away. My heart is tormented, so it is, for what have I in the\nworld but him?\"\n\n\"Is his father dead, ma'am?\" said the sergeant kindly.\n\n\"I'll tell the truth,\" said she. \"I don't know whether he is or not, for\na long time ago, when we used to live in the city of Bla' Cliah, he lost\nhis work one time and he never came back to me again. He was ashamed to\ncome home I'm thinking, the poor man, because he had no money; as if\nI would have minded whether he had any money or not--sure, he was very\nfond of me, sir, and we could have pulled along somehow. After that I\ncame back to my father's place here; the rest of the children died on\nme, and then my father died, and I'm doing the best I can by myself.\nIt's only that I'm a little bit troubled with the boy now and again.\"\n\n\"It's a hard case, ma'am,\" said the sergeant, \"but maybe the boy is only\na bit wild not having his father over him, and maybe it's just that he's\nused to yourself, for there isn't a child at all that doesn't love his\nmother. Let you behave yourself now, Tomas; attend to your mother, and\nleave the beasts and the insects alone, like a decent boy, for there's\nno insect in the world will ever like you as well as she does. Could you\ntell me, ma'am, if we have passed the first turn on this road, or is it\nin front of us still, for we are lost altogether in the darkness?\"\n\n\"It's in front of you still,\" she replied, \"about ten minutes down the\nroad; you can't miss it, for you'll see the sky where there is a gap in\nthe trees, and that gap is the turn you want.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said the sergeant; \"we'd better be moving on, for\nthere's a long tramp in front of us before we get to sleep this night.\"\n\nHe stood up and the men rose to follow him when, suddenly, the boy spoke\nin a whisper.\n\n\"Mother,\" said he, \"they are going to hang the man,\" and he burst into\ntears.\n\n\"Oh, hush, hush,\" said the woman, \"sure, the men can't help it.\" She\ndropped quickly on her knees and opened her arms, \"Come over to your\nmother, my darling.\"\n\nThe boy ran to her.\n\n\"They are going to hang him,\" he cried in a high, thin voice, and he\nplucked at her arm violently.\n\n\"Now, then, my young boy-o,\" said the sergeant, \"none of that violence.\"\n\nThe boy turned suddenly and flew at him with astonishing ferocity. He\nhurled himself against the sergeant's legs and bit, and kicked, and\nstruck at him. So furiously sudden was his attack that the man went\nstaggering back against the wall, then he plucked at the boy and whirled\nhim across the room. In an instant the two dogs leaped at him snarling\nwith rage--one of these he kicked into a corner, from which it rebounded\nagain bristling and red-eyed; the other dog was caught by the woman,\nand after a few frantic seconds she gripped the first dog also. To a\nhorrible chorus of howls and snapping teeth the men hustled outside and\nslammed the door.\n\n\"Shawn,\" the sergeant bawled, \"have you got a good grip of that man?\"\n\n\"I have so,\" said Shawn.\n\n\"If he gets away I'll kick the belly out of you; mind that now! Come\nalong with you and no more of your slouching.\"\n\nThey marched down the road in a tingling silence.\n\n\"Dogs,\" said the Philosopher, \"are a most intelligent race of people--\"\n\n\"People, my granny!\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"From the earliest ages their intelligence has been observed and\nrecorded, so that ancient literatures are bulky with references to their\nsagacity and fidelity--\"\n\n\"Will you shut your old jaw?\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"I will not,\" said the Philosopher. \"Elephants also are credited with an\nextreme intelligence and devotion to their masters, and they will build\na wall or nurse a baby with equal skill and happiness. Horses have\nreceived high recommendations in this respect, but crocodiles, hens,\nbeetles, armadillos, and fish do not evince any remarkable partiality\nfor man--\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said the sergeant bitterly, \"that all them beasts were stuffed\ndown your throttle the way you'd have to hold your prate.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said the Philosopher. \"I do not know why these\nanimals should attach themselves to men with gentleness and love and yet\nbe able to preserve intact their initial bloodthirstiness, so that while\nthey will allow their masters to misuse them in any way they will yet\nfight most willingly with each other, and are never really happy saving\nin the conduct of some private and nonsensical battle of their own. I do\nnot believe that it is fear which tames these creatures into mildness,\nbut that the most savage animal has a capacity for love which has not\nbeen sufficiently noted, and which, if more intelligent attention\nhad been directed upon it, would have raised them to the status of\nintellectual animals as against intelligent ones, and, perhaps, have\nopened to us a correspondence which could not have been other than\nbeneficial.\"\n\n\"Keep your eyes out for that gap in the trees, Shawn,\" said the\nsergeant.\n\n\"I'm doing that,\" said Shawn.\n\nThe Philosopher continued:\n\n\"Why can I not exchange ideas with a cow? I am amazed at the\nincompleteness of my growth when I and a fellow-creature stand dumbly\nbefore each other without one glimmer of comprehension, locked and\nbarred from all friendship and intercourse--\"\n\n\"Shawn,\" cried the sergeant.\n\n\"Don't interrupt,\" said the Philosopher; \"you are always talking.--The\nlower animals, as they are foolishly called, have abilities at which we\ncan only wonder. The mind of an ant is one to which I would readily go\nto school. Birds have atmospheric and levitational information which\nmillions of years will not render accessible to us; who that has seen a\nspider weaving his labyrinth, or a bee voyaging safely in the trackless\nair, can refuse to credit that a vivid, trained intelligence animates\nthese small enigmas? and the commonest earthworm is the heir to a\nculture before which I bow with the profoundest veneration--\"\n\n\"Shawn,\" said the sergeant, \"say something for goodness' sake to take\nthe sound of that man's clack out of my ear.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know what to be talking about,\" said Shawn, \"for I never\nwas much of a hand at conversation, and, barring my prayers, I got no\neducation--I think myself that he was making a remark about a dog. Did\nyou ever own a dog, sergeant?\"\n\n\"You are doing very well, Shawn,\" said the sergeant, \"keep it up now.\"\n\n\"I knew a man had a dog would count up to a hundred for you. He won lots\nof money in bets about it, and he'd have made a fortune, only that I\nnoticed one day he used to be winking at the dog, and when he'd stop\nwinking the dog would stop counting. We made him turn his back after\nthat, and got the dog to count sixpence, but he barked for more than\nfive shillings, he did so, and he would have counted up to a pound,\nmaybe, only that his master turned round and hit him a kick. Every\nperson that ever paid him a bet said they wanted their money back, but\nthe man went away to America in the night, and I expect he's doing well\nthere for he took the dog with him. It was a wire-haired terrier bitch,\nand it was the devil for having pups.\"\n\n\"It is astonishing,\" said the Philosopher, \"on what slender compulsion\npeople will go to America--\"\n\n\"Keep it up, Shawn,\" said the sergeant, \"you are doing me a favour.\"\n\n\"I will so,\" said Shawn. \"I had a cat one time and it used to have\nkittens every two months.\"\n\nThe Philosopher's voice arose:\n\n\"If there was any periodicity about these migrations one could\nunderstand them. Birds, for example, migrate from their homes in the\nlate autumn and seek abroad the sustenance and warmth which the winter\nwould withhold if they remained in their native lands. The salmon also,\na dignified fish with a pink skin, emigrates from the Atlantic\nOcean, and betakes himself inland to the streams and lakes, where he\nrecuperates for a season, and is often surprised by net, angle, or\nspear--\"\n\n\"Cut in now, Shawn,\" said the sergeant anxiously.\n\nShawn began to gabble with amazing speed and in a mighty voice:\n\n\"Cats sometimes eat their kittens, and sometimes they don't. A cat that\neats its kittens is a heartless brute. I knew a cat used to eat its\nkittens--it had four legs and a long tail, and it used to get the\nhead-staggers every time it had eaten its kittens. I killed it myself\none day with a hammer for I couldn't stand the smell it made, so I\ncouldn't--\"\n\n\"Shawn,\" said the sergeant, \"can't you talk about something else besides\ncats and dogs?\"\n\n\"Sure, I don't know what to talk about,\" said Shawn. \"I'm sweating this\nminute trying to please you, so I arm. If you'll tell me what to talk\nabout I'll do my endeavours.\"\n\n\"You're a fool,\" said the sergeant sorrowfully; \"you'll never make a\nconstable. I'm thinking that I would sooner listen to the man himself\nthan to you. Have you got a good hold of him now?\"\n\n\"I have so,\" said Shawn.\n\n\"Well, step out and maybe we'll reach the barracks this night, unless\nthis is a road that there isn't any end to at all. What was that? Did\nyou hear a noise?\"\n\n\"I didn't hear a thing,\" said Shawn.\n\n\"I thought,\" said another man, \"that I heard something moving in the\nhedge at the side of the road.\"\n\n\"That's what I heard,\" said the sergeant. \"Maybe it was a weasel. I wish\nto the devil that we were out of this place where you can't see as much\nas your own nose. Now did you hear it, Shawn?\"\n\n\"I did so,\" said Shawn; \"there's some one in the hedge, for a weasel\nwould make a different kind of a noise if it made any at all.\"\n\n\"Keep together, men,\" said the sergeant, \"and march on; if there's\nanybody about they've no business with us.\"\n\nHe had scarcely spoken when there came a sudden pattering of feet, and\nimmediately the four men were surrounded and were being struck at on\nevery side with sticks and hands and feet.\n\n\"Draw your batons,\" the sergeant roared; \"keep a good grip of that man,\nShawn.\"\n\n\"I will so,\" said Shawn.\n\n\"Stand round him, you other men, and hit anything that comes near you.\"\n\nThere was no sound of voices from the assailants, only a rapid scuffle\nof feet, the whistle of sticks as they swung through the air or slapped\nsmartly against a body or clashed upon each other, and the quick\nbreathing of many people; but from the four policemen there came noise\nand to spare as they struck wildly on every side, cursing the darkness\nand their opposers with fierce enthusiasm.\n\n\"Let out,\" cried Shawn suddenly. \"Let out or I'll smash your nut for\nyou. There's some one pulling at the prisoner, and I've dropped my\nbaton.\"\n\nThe truncheons of the policemen had been so ferociously exercised that\ntheir antagonists departed as swiftly and as mysteriously as they came.\nIt was just two minutes of frantic, aimless conflict, and then the\nsilent night was round them again, without any sound but the slow\ncreaking of branches, the swish of leaves as they swung and poised, and\nthe quiet croon of the wind along the road.\n\n\"Come on, men,\" said the sergeant, \"we'd better be getting out of this\nplace as quick as we can. Are any of ye hurted?\"\n\n\"I've got one of the enemy,\" said Shawn, panting.\n\n\"You've got what?\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"I've got one of them, and he is wriggling like an eel on a pan.\"\n\n\"Hold him tight,\" said the sergeant excitedly.\n\n\"I will so,\" said Shawn. \"It's a little one by the feel of it. If one\nof ye would hold the prisoner, I'd get a better grip on this one. Aren't\nthey dangerous villains now?\"\n\nAnother man took hold of the Philosopher's arm, and Shawn got both hands\non his captive.\n\n\"Keep quiet, I'm telling you,\" said he, \"or I'll throttle you, I will\nso. Faith, it seems like a little boy by the feel of it!\"\n\n\"A little boy!\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"Yes, he doesn't reach up to my waist.\"\n\n\"It must be the young brat from the cottage that set the dogs on us, the\none that loves beasts. Now then, boy, what do you mean by this kind of\nthing? You'll find yourself in gaol for this, my young buck-o. Who was\nwith you, eh? Tell me that now?\" and the sergeant bent forward.\n\n\"Hold up your head, sonny, and talk to the sergeant,\" said Shawn. \"Oh!\"\nhe roared, and suddenly he made a little rush forward. \"I've got him,\"\nhe gasped; \"he nearly got away. It isn't a boy at all, sergeant; there's\nwhiskers on it!\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"I put my hand under its chin and there's whiskers on it. I nearly let\nhim out with the surprise, I did so.\"\n\n\"Try again,\" said the sergeant in a low voice; \"you are making a\nmistake.\"\n\n\"I don't like touching them,\" said Shawn. \"It's a soft whisker like a\nbilly-goat's. Maybe you'd try yourself, sergeant, for I tell you I'm\nfrightened of it.\"\n\n\"Hold him over here,\" said the sergeant, \"and keep a good grip of him.\"\n\n\"I'll do that,\" said Shawn, and he hauled some reluctant object towards\nhis superior.\n\nThe sergeant put out his hand and touched a head.\n\n\"It's only a boy's size to be sure,\" said he, then he slid his hand down\nthe face and withdrew it quickly.\n\n\"There are whiskers on it,\" said he soberly. \"What the devil can it be?\nI never met whiskers so near the ground before. Maybe they are false\nones, and it's just the boy yonder trying to disguise himself.\" He put\nout his hand again with an effort, felt his way to the chin, and tugged.\n\nInstantly there came a yell, so loud, so sudden, that every man of them\njumped in a panic.\n\n\"They are real whiskers,\" said the sergeant with a sigh. \"I wish I knew\nwhat it is. His voice is big enough for two men, and that's a fact. Have\nyou got another match on you?\"\n\n\"I have two more in my waistcoat pocket,\" said one of the men.\n\n\"Give me one of them,\" said the sergeant; \"I'll strike it myself.\"\n\nHe groped about until he found the hand with the match.\n\n\"Be sure and hold him tight, Shawn, the way we can have a good look at\nhim, for this is like to be a queer miracle of a thing.\"\n\n\"I'm holding him by the two arms,\" said Shawn, \"he can't stir anything\nbut his head, and I've got my chest on that.\"\n\nThe sergeant struck the match, shading it for a moment with his hand,\nthen he turned it on their new prisoner.\n\nThey saw a little man dressed in tight green clothes; he had a broad\npale face with staring eyes, and there was a thin fringe of grey whisker\nunder his chin--then the match went out.\n\n\"It's a Leprecaun,\" said the sergeant.\n\nThe men were silent for a full couple of minutes-at last Shawn spoke.\n\n\"Do you tell me so?\" said he in a musing voice; \"that's a queer miracle\naltogether.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said the sergeant. \"Doesn't it stand to reason that it can't be\nanything else? You saw it yourself.\"\n\nShawn plumped down on his knees before his captive.\n\n\"Tell me where the money is?\" he hissed. \"Tell me where the money is or\nI'll twist your neck off.\"\n\nThe other men also gathered eagerly around, shouting threats and\ncommands at the Leprecaun.\n\n\"Hold your whist,\" said Shawn fiercely to them. \"He can't answer the\nlot of you, can he?\" and he turned again to the Leprecaun and shook him\nuntil his teeth chattered.\n\n\"If you don't tell me where the money is at once I'll kill you, I will\nso.\"\n\n\"I haven't got any money at all, sir,\" said the Leprecaun.\n\n\"None of your lies,\" roared Shawn. \"Tell the truth now or it'll be worse\nfor you.\"\n\n\"I haven't got any money,\" said the Leprecaun, \"for Meehawl MacMurrachu\nof the Hill stole our crock a while back, and he buried it under a thorn\nbush. I can bring you to the place if you don't believe me.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Shawn. \"Come on with me now, and I'll clout you if you\nas much as wriggle; do you mind me?\"\n\n\"What would I wriggle for?\" said the Leprecaun: \"sure I like being with\nyou.\"\n\nHereupon the sergeant roared at the top of his voice.\n\n\"Attention,\" said he, and the men leaped to position like automata.\n\n\"What is it you are going to do with your prisoner, Shawn?\" said he\nsarcastically. \"Don't you think we've had enough tramping of these roads\nfor one night, now? Bring up that Leprecaun to the barracks or it'll be\nthe worse for you--do you hear me talking to you?\"\n\n\"But the gold, sergeant,\" said Shawn sulkily.\n\n\"If there's any gold it'll be treasure trove, and belong to the Crown.\nWhat kind of a constable are you at all, Shawn? Mind what you are about\nnow, my man, and no back answers. Step along there. Bring that murderer\nup at once, whichever of you has him.\"\n\nThere came a gasp from the darkness.\n\n\"Oh, Oh, Oh!\" said a voice of horror.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" said the sergeant: \"are you hurted?\"\n\n\"The prisoner!\" he gasped, \"he, he's got away!\"\n\n\"Got away?\" and the sergeant's voice was a blare of fury.\n\n\"While we were looking at the Leprecaun,\" said the voice of woe, \"I must\nhave forgotten about the other one--I, I haven't got him--\"\n\n\"You gawm!\" gritted the sergeant.\n\n\"Is it my prisoner that's gone?\" said Shawn in a deep voice. He leaped\nforward with a curse and smote his negligent comrade so terrible a blow\nin the face, that the man went flying backwards, and the thud of his\nhead on the road could have been heard anywhere.\n\n\"Get up,\" said Shawn, \"get up till I give you another one.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said the sergeant, \"we'll go home. We're the\nlaughing-stock of the world. I'll pay you out for this some time, every\ndamn man of ye. Bring that Leprecaun along with you, and quick march.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Shawn in a strangled tone.\n\n\"What is it now?\" said the sergeant testily.\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Shawn.\n\n\"What did you say 'Oh!' for then, you block-head?\"\n\n\"It's the Leprecaun, sergeant,\" said Shawn in a whisper--\"he's got\naway--when I was hitting the man there I forgot all about the Leprecaun:\nhe must have run into the hedge. Oh, sergeant, dear, don't say anything\nto me now--!\"\n\n\"Quick march,\" said the sergeant, and the four men moved on through the\ndarkness in a silence, which was only skin deep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nBY reason of the many years which he had spent in the gloomy pine wood,\nthe Philosopher could see a little in the darkness, and when he found\nthere was no longer any hold on his coat he continued his journey\nquietly, marching along with his head sunken on his breast in a deep\nabstraction. He was meditating on the word \"Me,\" and endeavouring to\npursue it through all its changes and adventures. The fact of \"me-ness\"\nwas one which startled him. He was amazed at his own being. He knew that\nthe hand which he held up and pinched with another hand was not him\nand the endeavour to find out what was him was one which had frequently\nexercised his leisure. He had not gone far when there came a tug at\nhis sleeve and looking down he found one of the Leprecauns of the Gort\ntrotting by his side.\n\n\"Noble Sir,\" said the Leprecaun, \"you are terrible hard to get into\nconversation with. I have been talking to you for the last long time and\nyou won't listen.\"\n\n\"I am listening now,\" replied the Philosopher.\n\n\"You are, indeed,\" said the Leprecaun heartily. \"My brothers are on the\nother side of the road over there beyond the hedge, and they want to\ntalk to you: will you come with me, Noble Sir?\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't I go with you?\" said the Philosopher, and he turned aside\nwith the Leprecaun.\n\nThey pushed softly through a gap in the hedge and into a field beyond.\n\n\"Come this way, sir,\" said his guide, and the Philosopher followed him\nacross the field. In a few minutes they came to a thick bush among the\nleaves of which the other Leprecauns were hiding. They thronged out to\nmeet the Philosopher's approach and welcomed him with every appearance\nof joy. With them was the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, who embraced her\nhusband tenderly and gave thanks for his escape.\n\n\"The night is young yet,\" remarked one of the Leprecauns. \"Let us sit\ndown here and talk about what should be done.\"\n\n\"I am tired enough,\" said the Philosopher, \"for I have been travelling\nall yesterday, and all this day and the whole of this night I have been\ngoing also, so I would be glad to sit down anywhere.\"\n\nThey sat down under the bush and the Philosopher lit his pipe. In the\nopen space where they were there was just light enough to see the smoke\ncoming from his pipe, but scarcely more. One recognized a figure as a\ndeeper shadow than the surrounding darkness; but as the ground was dry\nand the air just touched with a pleasant chill, there was no discomfort.\nAfter the Philosopher had drawn a few mouthfuls of smoke he passed his\npipe on to the next person, and in this way his pipe made the circuit of\nthe party.\n\n\"When I put the children to bed,\" said the Thin Woman, \"I came down the\nroad in your wake with a basin of stirabout, for you had no time to take\nyour food, God help you! and I was thinking you must have been hungry.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" said the Philosopher in a very anxious voice: \"but I don't\nblame you, my dear, for letting the basin fall on the road--\"\n\n\"While I was going along,\" she continued, \"I met these good people and\nwhen I told them what happened they came with me to see if anything\ncould be done. The time they ran out of the hedge to fight the policemen\nI wanted to go with them, but I was afraid the stirabout would be\nspilt.\"\n\nThe Philosopher licked his lips.\n\n\"I am listening to you, my love,\" said he.\n\n\"So I had to stay where I was with the stirabout under my shawl--\"\n\n\"Did you slip then, dear wife?\"\n\n\"I did not, indeed,\" she replied: \"I have the stirabout with me this\nminute. It's rather cold, I'm thinking, but it is better than nothing at\nall,\" and she placed the bowl in his hands.\n\n\"I put sugar in it,\" said she shyly, \"and currants, and I have a spoon\nin my pocket.\"\n\n\"It tastes well,\" said the Philosopher, and he cleaned the basin so\nspeedily that his wife wept because of his hunger.\n\nBy this time the pipe had come round to him again and it was welcomed.\n\n\"Now we can talk,\" said he, and he blew a great cloud of smoke into the\ndarkness and sighed happily.\n\n\"We were thinking,\" said the Thin Woman, \"that you won't be able to come\nback to our house for a while yet: the policemen will be peeping about\nCoille Doraca for a long time, to be sure; for isn't it true that if\nthere is a good thing coming to a person, nobody takes much trouble to\nfind him, but if there is a bad thing or a punishment in store for a\nman, then the whole world will be searched until he be found?\"\n\n\"It is a true statement,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"So what we arranged was this--that you should go to live with these\nlittle men in their house under the yew tree of the Gort. There is not a\npoliceman in the world would find you there; or if you went by night to\nthe Brugh of the Boyne, Angus Og himself would give you a refuge.\"\n\nOne of the Leprecauns here interposed.\n\n\"Noble Sir,\" said he, \"there isn't much room in our house but there's no\nstint of welcome in it. You would have a good time with us travelling on\nmoonlit nights and seeing strange things, for we often go to visit the\nShee of the Hills and they come to see us; there is always something\nto talk about, and we have dances in the caves and on the tops of the\nhills. Don't be imagining now that we have a poor life for there is fun\nand plenty with us and the Brugh of Angus Mac an Og is hard to be got\nat.\"\n\n\"I would like to dance, indeed,\" returned the Philosopher, \"for I do\nbelieve that dancing is the first and last duty of man. If we cannot be\ngay what can we be? Life is not any use at all unless we find a laugh\nhere and there--but this time, decent men of the Gort, I cannot go with\nyou, for it is laid on me to give myself up to the police.\"\n\n\"You would not do that,\" exclaimed the Thin Woman pitifully: \"You\nwouldn't think of doing that now!\"\n\n\"An innocent man,\" said he, \"cannot be oppressed, for he is fortified\nby his mind and his heart cheers him. It is only on a guilty person that\nthe rigour of punishment can fall, for he punishes himself. This is what\nI think, that a man should always obey the law with his body and always\ndisobey it with his mind. I have been arrested, the men of the law had\nme in their hands, and I will have to go back to them so that they may\ndo whatever they have to do.\"\n\nThe Philosopher resumed his pipe, and although the others reasoned with\nhim for a long time they could not by any means remove him from his\npurpose. So, when the pale glimmer of dawn had stolen over the sky,\nthey arose and went downwards to the cross-roads and so to the Police\nStation.\n\nOutside the village the Leprecauns bade him farewell and the Thin Woman\nalso took her leave of him, saying she would visit Angus Og and implore\nhis assistance on behalf of her husband, and then the Leprecauns and the\nThin Woman returned again the way they came, and the Philosopher walked\non to the barracks.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nWHEN he knocked at the barracks door it was opened by a man with\ntousled, red hair, who looked as though he had just awakened from sleep.\n\n\"What do you want at this hour of the night?\" said he.\n\n\"I want to give myself up,\" said the Philosopher. The policeman looked\nat him \"A man as old as you are,\" said he, \"oughtn't to be a fool. Go\nhome now, I advise you, and don't say a word to any one whether you did\nit or not. Tell me this now, was it found out, or are you only making a\nclean breast of it?\"\n\n\"Sure I must give myself up,\" said the Philosopher.\n\n\"If you must, you must, and that's an end of it. Wipe your feet on the\nrail there and come in--I'll take your deposition.\"\n\n\"I have no deposition for you,\" said the Philosopher, \"for I didn't do a\nthing at all.\"\n\nThe policeman stared at him again.\n\n\"If that's so,\" said he, \"you needn't come in at all, and you needn't\nhave wakened me out of my sleep either. Maybe, tho', you are the man\nthat fought the badger on the Naas Road--Eh?\"\n\n\"I am not,\" replied the Philosopher: \"but I was arrested for killing my\nbrother and his wife, although I never touched them.\"\n\n\"Is that who you are?\" said the policeman; and then, briskly, \"You're as\nwelcome as the cuckoo, you are so. Come in and make yourself comfortable\ntill the men awaken, and they are the lads that'll be glad to see you.\nI couldn't make head or tail of what they said when they came in last\nnight, and no one else either, for they did nothing but fight each other\nand curse the banshees and cluricauns of Leinster. Sit down there on the\nsettle by the fire and, maybe, you'll be able to get a sleep; you look\nas if you were tired, and the mud of every county in Ireland is on your\nboots.\"\n\nThe Philosopher thanked him and stretched out on the settle. In a short\ntime, for he was very weary, he fell asleep.\n\nMany hours later he was awakened by the sound of voices, and found on\nrising, that the men who had captured him on the previous evening were\nstanding by the bed. The sergeant's face beamed with joy. He was dressed\nonly in his trousers and shirt. His hair was sticking up in some places\nand sticking out in others which gave a certain wild look to him, and\nhis feet were bare. He took the Philosopher's two hands in his own and\nswore if ever there was anything he could do to comfort him he would do\nthat and more. Shawn, in a similar state of unclothedness, greeted the\nPhilosopher and proclaimed himself his friend and follower for ever.\nShawn further announced that he did not believe the Philosopher had\nkilled the two people, that if he had killed them they must have richly\ndeserved it, and that if he was hung he would plant flowers on his\ngrave; for a decenter, quieter, and wiser man he had never met and never\nwould meet in the world.\n\nThese professions of esteem comforted the Philosopher, and he replied to\nthem in terms which made the red-haired policeman gape in astonishment\nand approval.\n\nHe was given a breakfast of bread and cocoa which he ate with his\nguardians, and then, as they had to take up their outdoor duties, he\nwas conducted to the backyard and informed he could walk about there\nand that he might smoke until he was black in the face. The policemen\nseverally presented him with a pipe, a tin of tobacco, two boxes of\nmatches and a dictionary, and then they withdrew, leaving him to his own\ndevices.\n\nThe garden was about twelve feet square, having high, smooth walls on\nevery side, and into it there came neither sun nor wind. In one corner a\nclump of rusty-looking sweet-pea was climbing up the wall--every leaf\nof this plant was riddled with holes, and there were no flowers on it.\nAnother corner was occupied by dwarf nasturtiums, and on this plant,\nin despite of every discouragement, two flowers were blooming, but its\nleaves also were tattered and dejected. A mass of ivy clung to the third\ncorner, its leaves were big and glossy at the top, but near the ground\nthere was only grey, naked stalks laced together by cobwebs. The fourth\nwall was clothed in a loose Virginia creeper every leaf of which looked\nlike an insect that could crawl if it wanted to. The centre of this\nsmall plot had used every possible artifice to cover itself with grass,\nand in some places it had wonderfully succeeded, but the pieces of\nbroken bottles, shattered jampots, and sections of crockery were so\nnumerous that no attempt at growth could be other than tentative and\nunpassioned.\n\nHere, for a long time, the Philosopher marched up and down. At one\nmoment he examined the sweet-pea and mourned with it on a wretched\nexistence. Again he congratulated the nasturtium on its two bright\nchildren; but he thought of the gardens wherein they might have bloomed\nand the remembrance of that spacious, sunny freedom saddened him.\n\n\"Indeed, poor creatures!\" said he, \"ye also are in gaol.\"\n\nThe blank, soundless yard troubled him so much that at last he called to\nthe red-haired policeman and begged to be put into a cell in preference;\nand to the common cell he was, accordingly, conducted.\n\nThis place was a small cellar built beneath the level of the ground. An\niron grating at the top of the wall admitted one blanched wink of light,\nbut the place was bathed in obscurity. A wooden ladder led down to the\ncell from a hole in the ceiling, and this hole also gave a spark of\nbrightness and some little air to the room. The walls were of stone\ncovered with plaster, but the plaster had fallen away in many places\nleaving the rough stones visible at every turn of the eye.\n\nThere were two men in the cell, and these the Philosopher saluted; but\nthey did not reply, nor did they speak to each other. There was a low,\nwooden form fixed to the wall, running quite round the room, and on\nthis, far apart from each other, the two men were seated, with their\nelbows resting on their knees, their heads propped upon their hands,\nand each of them with an unwavering gaze fixed on the floor between his\nfeet.\n\nThe Philosopher walked for a time up and down the little cell, but soon\nhe also sat down on the low form, propped his head on his hands and\nlapsed to a melancholy dream.\n\nSo the day passed. Twice a policeman came down the ladder bearing three\nportions of food, bread and cocoa; and by imperceptible gradations the\nlight faded away from the grating and the darkness came. After a great\ninterval the policeman again approached carrying three mattresses and\nthree rough blankets, and these he bundled through the hole. Each of the\nmen took a mattress and a blanket and spread them on the floor, and the\nPhilosopher took his share also.\n\nBy this time they could not see each other and all their operations were\nconducted by the sense of touch alone. They laid themselves down on the\nbeds and a terrible, dark silence brooded over the room.\n\nBut the Philosopher could not sleep, he kept his eyes shut, for the\ndarkness under his eyelids was not so dense as that which surrounded\nhim; indeed, he could at will illuminate his own darkness and order\naround him the sunny roads or the sparkling sky. While his eyes were\nclosed he had the mastery of all pictures of light and colour and\nwarmth, but an irresistible fascination compelled him every few minutes\nto reopen them, and in the sad space around he could not create any\nhappiness. The darkness weighed very sadly upon him so that in a short\ntime it did creep under his eyelids and drowned his happy pictures until\na blackness possessed him both within and without \"Can one's mind go to\nprison as well as one's body?\" said he.\n\nHe strove desperately to regain his intellectual freedom, but he could\nnot. He could conjure up no visions but those of fear. The creatures of\nthe dark invaded him, fantastic terrors were thronging on every side:\nthey came from the darkness into his eyes and beyond into himself, so\nthat his mind as well as his fancy was captured, and he knew he was,\nindeed, in gaol.\n\nIt was with a great start that he heard a voice speaking from the\nsilence--a harsh, yet cultivated voice, but he could not imagine which\nof his companions was speaking. He had a vision of that man tormented\nby the mental imprisonment of the darkness, trying to get away from his\nghosts and slimy enemies, goaded into speech in his own despite lest he\nshould be submerged and finally possessed by the abysmal demons. For a\nwhile the voice spoke of the strangeness of life and the cruelty of\nmen to each other--disconnected sentences, odd words of selfpity and\nself-encouragement, and then the matter became more connected and a\nstory grew in the dark cell \"I knew a man,\" said the voice, \"and he was\na clerk. He had thirty shillings a week, and for five years he had never\nmissed a day going to his work. He was a careful man, but a person with\na wife and four children cannot save much out of thirty shillings a\nweek. The rent of a house is high, a wife and children must be fed, and\nthey have to get boots and clothes, so that at the end of each week\nthat man's thirty shillings used to be all gone. But they managed to get\nalong somehow--the man and his wife and the four children were fed and\nclothed and educated, and the man often wondered how so much could\nbe done with so little money; but the reason was that his wife was a\ncareful woman... and then the man got sick. A poor person cannot afford\nto get sick, and a married man cannot leave his work. If he is sick\nhe has to be sick; but he must go to his work all the same, for if he\nstayed away who would pay the wages and feed his family? and when he\nwent back to work he might find that there was nothing for him to do.\nThis man fell sick, but he made no change in his way of life: he got up\nat the same time and went to the office as usual, and he got through the\nday somehow without attracting his employer's attention. He didn't know\nwhat was wrong with him: he only knew that he was sick. Sometimes he had\nsharp, swift pains in his head, and again there would be long hours of\nlanguor when he could scarcely bear to change his position or lift a\npen. He would commence a letter with the words 'Dear Sir,' forming the\nletter 'D' with painful, accurate slowness, elaborating and thickening\nthe up and down strokes, and being troubled when he had to leave that\nletter for the next one; he built the next letter by hair strokes and\nwould start on the third with hatred. The end of a word seemed to that\nman like the conclusion of an event--it was a surprising, isolated,\nindividual thing, having no reference to anything else in the world,\nand on starting a new word he seemed bound, in order to preserve its\nindividuality, to write it in a different handwriting. He would sit with\nhis shoulders hunched up and his pen resting on the paper, staring at a\nletter until he was nearly mesmerized, and then come to himself with a\nsense of fear, which started him working like a madman, so that he might\nnot be behind with his business. The day seemed to be so long. It rolled\non rusty hinges that could scarcely move. Each hour was like a great\ncircle swollen with heavy air, and it droned and buzzed into an\neternity. It seemed to the man that his hand in particular wanted to\nrest. It was luxury not to work with it. It was good to lay it down on\na sheet of paper with the pen sloping against his finger, and then watch\nhis hand going to sleep--it seemed to the man that it was his hand\nand not himself wanted to sleep, but it always awakened when the pen\nslipped. There was an instinct in him somewhere not to let the pen\nslip, and every time the pen moved his hand awakened, and began to work\nlanguidly. When he went home at night he lay down at once and stared\nfor hours at a fly on the wall or a crack on the ceiling. When his wife\nspoke to him he heard her speaking as from a great distance, and he\nanswered her dully as though he was replying through a cloud. He only\nwanted to be let alone, to be allowed to stare at the fly on the wall,\nor the crack on the ceiling.\n\n\"One morning he found that he couldn't get up, or rather, that he didn't\nwant to get up. When his wife called him he made no reply, and she\nseemed to call him every ten seconds--the words, 'get up, get up,' were\ncrackling all round him; they were bursting like bombs on the right hand\nand on the left of him: they were scattering from above and all around\nhim, bursting upwards from the floor, swirling, swaying, and jostling\neach other. Then the sounds ceased, and one voice only said to him\n'You are late!' He saw these words like a blur hanging in the air, just\nbeyond his eyelids, and he stared at the blur until he fell asleep.\"\n\nThe voice in the cell ceased speaking for a few minutes, and then it\nwent on again.\n\n\"For three weeks the man did not leave his bed--he lived faintly in a\nkind of trance, wherein great forms moved about slowly and immense\nwords were drumming gently for ever. When he began to take notice again\neverything in the house was different. Most of the furniture, paid for\nso hardly, was gone. He missed a thing everywhere--chairs, a mirror,\na table: wherever he looked he missed something; and downstairs was\nworse--there, everything was gone. His wife had sold all her furniture\nto pay for doctors, for medicine, for food and rent. And she was changed\ntoo: good things had gone from her face; she was gaunt, sharp-featured,\nmiserable--but she was comforted to think he was going back to work\nsoon.\n\n\"There was a flurry in his head when he went to his office. He didn't\nknow what his employer would say for stopping away. He might blame him\nfor being sick--he wondered would his employer pay him for the weeks he\nwas absent. When he stood at the door he was frightened. Suddenly the\nthought of his master's eye grew terrible to him: it was a steady, cold,\nglassy eye; but he opened the door and went in. His master was there\nwith another man and he tried to say 'Good morning, sir,' in a natural\nand calm voice; but he knew that the strange man had been engaged\ninstead of himself, and this knowledge posted itself between his tongue\nand his thought. He heard himself stammering, he felt that his whole\nbearing had become drooping and abject. His master was talking swiftly\nand the other man was looking at him in an embarrassed, stealthy, and\npleading manner: his eyes seemed to be apologising for having supplanted\nhim--so he mumbled 'Good day, sir,' and stumbled out.\n\n\"When he got outside he could not think where to go. After a while he\nwent in the direction of the little park in the centre of the city. It\nwas quite near and he sat down on an iron bench facing a pond. There\nwere children walking up and down by the water giving pieces of bread to\nthe swans. Now and again a labouring man or a messenger went by quickly;\nnow and again a middleaged, slovenly-dressed man drooped past aimlessly:\nsometimes a tattered, self-intent woman with a badgered face flopped by\nhim. When he looked at these dull people the thought came to him that\nthey were not walking there at all; they were trailing through hell,\nand their desperate eyes saw none but devils around them. He saw himself\njoining these battered strollers... and he could not think what he would\ntell his wife when he went home. He rehearsed to himself the terms of\nhis dismissal a hundred times. How his master looked, what he had said:\nand then the fine, ironical things he had said to his master. He sat in\nthe park all day, and when evening fell he went home at his accustomed\nhour.\n\n\"His wife asked him questions as to how he had got on, and wanted to\nknow was there any chance of being paid for the weeks of absence; the\nman answered her volubly, ate his supper and went to bed: but he did\nnot tell his wife that he had been dismissed and that there would be no\nmoney at the end of the week. He tried to tell her, but when he met her\neye he found that he could not say the words--he was afraid of the look\nthat might come into her face when she heard it--she, standing terrified\nin those dismantled rooms...!\n\n\"In the morning he ate his breakfast and went out again--to work, his\nwife thought. She bid him ask the master about the three weeks' wages,\nor to try and get an advance on the present week's wages, for they were\nhardly put to it to buy food. He said he would do his best, but he\nwent straight to the park and sat looking at the pond, looking at the\npassers-by and dreaming. In the middle of the day he started up in\na panic and went about the city asking for work in offices, shops,\nwarehouses, everywhere, but he could not get any. He trailed back\nheavy-footed again to the park and sat down.\n\n\"He told his wife more lies about his work that night and what his\nmaster had said when he asked for an advance. He couldn't bear the\nchildren to touch him. After a little time he sneaked away to his bed.\n\n\"A week went that way. He didn't look for work any more. He sat in the\npark, dreaming, with his head bowed into his hands. The next day would\nbe the day he should have been paid his wages. The next day! What would\nhis wife say when he told her he had no money? She would stare at him\nand flush and say-'Didn't you go out every day to work?'--How would he\ntell her then so that she could understand quickly and spare him words?\n\n\"Morning came and the man ate his breakfast silently. There was no\nbutter on the bread, and his wife seemed to be apologising to him for\nnot having any. She said, 'We'll be able to start fair from to-morrow,'\nand when he snapped at her angrily she thought it was because he had to\neat dry bread.\n\n\"He went to the park and sat there for hours. Now and again he got up\nand walked into a neighbouring street, but always, after half an hour\nor so, he came back. Six o'clock in the evening was his hour for going\nhome. When six o'clock came he did not move, he still sat opposite the\npond with his head bowed down into his arms. Seven o'clock passed. At\nnine o'clock a bell was rung and every one had to leave. He went also.\nHe stood outside the gates looking on this side and on that. Which\nway would he go? All roads were alike to him, so he turned at last and\nwalked somewhere. He did not go home that night. He never went home\nagain. He never was heard of again anywhere in the wide world.\"\n\nThe voice ceased speaking and silence swung down again upon the little\ncell. The Philosopher had been listening intently to this story, and\nafter a few minutes he spoke \"When you go up this road there is a turn\nto the left and all the path along is bordered with trees--there are\nbirds in the trees, Glory be to God! There is only one house on that\nroad, and the woman in it gave us milk to drink. She has but one son, a\ngood boy, and she said the other children were dead; she was speaking of\na husband who went away and left her--'Why should he have been afraid to\ncome home?' said she--'sure, I loved him.'\"\n\nAfter a little interval the voice spoke again \"I don't know what became\nof the man I was speaking of. I am a thief, and I'm well known to the\npolice everywhere. I don't think that man would get a welcome at the\nhouse up here, for why should he?\"\n\nAnother, a different, querulous kind of voice came from the silence \"If\nI knew a place where there was a welcome I'd go there as quickly as I\ncould, but I don't know a place and I never will, for what good would\na man of my age be to any person? I am a thief also. The first thing I\nstole was a hen out of a little yard. I roasted it in a ditch and ate\nit, and then I stole another one and ate it, and after that I stole\neverything I could lay my hands on. I suppose I will steal as long as I\nlive, and I'll die in a ditch at the heel of the hunt. There was a time,\nnot long ago, and if any one had told me then that I would rob, even\nfor hunger, I'd have been insulted: but what does it matter now? And\nthe reason I am a thief is because I got old without noticing it.\nOther people noticed it, but I did not. I suppose age comes on one so\ngradually that it is seldom observed. If there are wrinkles on one's\nface we do not remember when they were not there: we put down all kind\nof little infirmities to sedentary living, and you will see plenty of\nyoung people bald. If a man has no occasion to tell any one his age,\nand if he never thinks of it himself, he won't see ten years' difference\nbetween his youth and his age, for we live in slow, quiet times, and\nnothing ever happens to mark the years as they go by, one after the\nother, and all the same.\n\n\"I lodged in a house for a great many years, and a little girl grew\nup there, the daughter of my landlady. She used to slide down the\nbannisters very well, and she used to play the piano very badly. These\ntwo things worried me many a time. She used to bring me my meals in the\nmorning and the evening, and often enough she'd stop to talk with me\nwhile I was eating. She was a very chatty girl and I was a talkative\nperson myself. When she was about eighteen years of age I got so used\nto her that if her mother came with the food I would be worried for\nthe rest of the day. Her face was as bright as a sunbeam, and her lazy,\ncareless ways, big, free movements, and girlish chatter were pleasant to\na man whose loneliness was only beginning to be apparent to him through\nher company. I've thought of it often since, and I suppose that's how it\nbegan. She used to listen to all my opinions and she'd agree with them\nbecause she had none of her own yet. She was a good girl, but lazy in\nher mind and body; childish, in fact. Her talk was as involved as her\nactions: she always seemed to be sliding down mental bannisters; she\nthought in kinks and spoke in spasms, hopped mentally from one subject\nto another without the slightest difficulty, and could use a lot of\nlanguage in saying nothing at all. I could see all that at the time, but\nI suppose I was too pleased with my own sharp business brains, and\nsick enough, although I did not know it, of my sharp-brained, business\ncompanions--dear Lord! I remember them well. It's easy enough to have\nbrains as they call it, but it is not so easy to have a little gaiety\nor carelessness or childishness or whatever it was she had. It is good,\ntoo, to feel superior to some one, even a girl.\n\n\"One day this thought came to me--'It is time that I settled down.' I\ndon't know where the idea came from; one hears it often enough and it\nalways seems to apply to some one else, but I don't know what brought\nit to roost with me. I was foolish, too: I bought ties and differently\nshaped collars, and took to creasing my trousers by folding them under\nthe bed and lying on them all night--It never struck me that I was more\nthan three times her age. I brought home sweets for her and she was\ndelighted. She said she adored sweets, and she used to insist on my\neating some of them with her; she liked to compare notes as to how they\ntasted while eating them. I used to get a toothache from them, but I\nbore with it although at that time I hated toothache almost as much as\nI hated sweets. Then I asked her to come out with me for a walk. She\nwas willing enough and it was a novel experience for me. Indeed, it was\nrather exciting. We went out together often after that, and sometimes\nwe'd meet people I knew, young men from my office or from other offices.\nI used to be shy when some of these people winked at me as they saluted.\nIt was pleasant, too, telling the girl who they were, their business and\ntheir salaries: for there was little I didn't know. I used to tell her\nof my own position in the office and what the chief said to me through\nthe day. Sometimes we talked of the things that had appeared in the\nevening papers. A murder perhaps, some phase of a divorce case, the\nspeech a political person had made, or the price of stock. She was\ninterested in anything so long as it was talk. And her own share in the\nconversation was good to hear. Every lady that passed us had a hat that\nstirred her to the top of rapture or the other pinnacle of disgust.\nShe told me what ladies were frights and what were ducks. Under her\nscampering tongue I began to learn something of humanity, even though\nshe saw most people as delightfully funny clowns or superb, majestical\nprinces, but I noticed that she never said a bad word of a man, although\nmany of the men she looked after were ordinary enough. Until I went\nwalking with her I never knew what a shop window was. A jeweller's\nwindow especially: there were curious things in it. She told me how a\ntiara should be worn, and a pendant, and she explained the kind of studs\nI should wear myself; they were made of gold and had red stones in them;\nshe showed me the ropes of pearl or diamonds that she thought would look\npretty on herself: and one day she said that she liked me very much. I\nwas pleased and excited that day, but I was a business man and I said\nvery little in reply. I never liked a pig in a poke.\n\n\"She used to go out two nights in the week, Monday and Thursday, dressed\nin her best clothes. I didn't know where she went, and I didn't ask--I\nthought she visited an acquaintance, a girl friend or some such. The\ntime went by and I made up my mind to ask her to marry me. I had watched\nher long enough and she was always kind and bright. I liked the way she\nsmiled, and I liked her obedient, mannerly bearing. There was something\nelse I liked, which I did not recognise then, something surrounding all\nher movements, a graciousness, a spaciousness: I did not analyse it;\nbut I know now that it was her youth. I remember that when we were out\ntogether she walked slowly, but in the house she would leap up and down\nthe stairs--she moved furiously, but I didn't.\n\n\"One evening she dressed to go out as usual, and she called at my door\nto know had I everything I wanted. I said I had something to tell her\nwhen she came home, something important. She promised to come in early\nto hear it, and I laughed at her and she laughed back and went sliding\ndown the bannisters. I don't think I have had any reason to laugh since\nthat night. A letter came for me after she had gone, and I knew by the\nshape and the handwriting that it was from the office. It puzzled me to\nthink why I should be written to. I didn't like opening it somehow....\nIt was my dismissal on account of advancing age, and it hoped for my\nfuture welfare politely enough. It was signed by the Senior. I didn't\ngrip it at first, and then I thought it was a hoax. For a long time I\nsat in my room with an empty mind. I was watching my mind: there were\nimmense distances in it that drowsed and buzzed; large, soft movements\nseemed to be made in my mind, and although I was looking at the letter\nin my hand I was really trying to focus those great, swinging spaces in\nmy brain, and my ears were listening for a movement of some kind. I\ncan see back to that time plainly. I went walking up and down the room.\nThere was a dull, subterranean anger in me. I remember muttering once or\ntwice, 'Shameful!' and again I said, 'Ridiculous!' At the idea of age\nI looked at my face in the glass, but I was looking at my mind, and\nit seemed to go grey, there was a heaviness there also. I seemed to be\npeering from beneath a weight at something strange. I had a feeling that\nI had let go a grip which I had held tightly for a long time, and I had\na feeling that the letting go was a grave disaster... that strange face\nin the glass! how wrinkled it was! there were only a few hairs on the\nhead and they were grey ones. There was a constant twitching of the lips\nand the eyes were deep-set, little and dull. I left the glass and sat\ndown by the window, looking out. I saw nothing in the street: I just\nlooked into a blackness. My mind was as blank as the night and as\nsoundless. There was a swirl outside the window, rain tossed by the\nwind; without noticing, I saw it, and my brain swung with the rain until\nit heaved in circles, and then a feeling of faintness awakened me to\nmyself. I did not allow my mind to think, but now and again a word\nswooped from immense distances through my brain, swinging like a comet\nacross a sky and jarring terribly when it struck: 'Sacked' was one word,\n'Old' was another word.\n\n\"I don't know how long I sat watching the flight of these dreadful words\nand listening to their clanking impact, but a movement in the street\naroused me. Two people, the girl and a young, slender man, were coming\nslowly up to the house. The rain was falling heavily, but they did not\nseem to mind it. There was a big puddle of water close to the kerb, and\nthe girl, stepping daintily as a cat, went round this, but the young man\nstood for a moment beyond it. He raised both arms, clenched his fists,\nswung them, and jumped over the puddle. Then he and the girl stood\nlooking at the water, apparently measuring the jump. I could see them\nplainly by a street lamp. They were bidding each other good-bye. The\ngirl put her hand to his neck and settled the collar of his coat, and\nwhile her hand rested on him the young man suddenly and violently flung\nhis arms about her and hugged her; then they kissed and moved apart. The\nman walked to the rain puddle and stood there with his face turned back\nlaughing at her, and then he jumped straight into the middle of the\npuddle and began to dance up and down in it, the muddy water splashing\nup to his knees. She ran over to him crying 'Stop, silly!' When she came\ninto the house, I bolted my door and I gave no answer to her knock.\n\n\"In a few months the money I had saved was spent. I couldn't get any\nwork, I was too old; they put it that they wanted a younger man. I\ncouldn't pay my rent. I went out into the world again, like a baby,\nan old baby in a new world. I stole food, food, food anywhere and\neverywhere. At first I was always caught. Often I was sent to gaol;\nsometimes I was let go; sometimes I was kicked; but I learned to live\nlike a wolf at last. I am not often caught now when I steal food. But\nthere is something happening every day, whether it is going to gaol or\nplanning how to steal a hen or a loaf of bread. I find that it is a good\nlife, much better than the one I lived for nearly sixty years, and I\nhave time to think over every sort of thing....\"\n\nWhen the morning came the Philosopher was taken on a car to the big\nCity in order that he might be put on his trial and hanged. It was the\ncustom.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI. THE THIN WOMAN'S JOURNEY AND THE HAPPY MARCH\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE ability of the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath for anger was unbounded.\nShe was not one of those limited creatures who are swept clean by a gust\nof wrath and left placid and smiling after its passing. She could store\nher anger in those caverns of eternity which open into every soul, and\nwhich are filled with rage and violence until the time comes when they\nmay be stored with wisdom and love; for, in the genesis of life, love\nis at the beginning and the end of things. First, like a laughing\nchild, love came to labour minutely in the rocks and sands of the heart,\nopening the first of those roads which lead inwards for ever, and then,\nthe labour of his day being done, love fled away and was forgotten.\nFollowing came the fierce winds of hate to work like giants and gnomes\namong the prodigious debris, quarrying the rocks and levelling the\nroads which soar inwards; but when that work is completed love will come\nradiantly again to live for ever in the human heart, which is Eternity.\n\nBefore the Thin Woman could undertake the redemption of her husband by\nwrath, it was necessary that she should be purified by the performance\nof that sacrifice which is called the Forgiveness of Enemies, and this\nshe did by embracing the Leprecauns of the Gort and in the presence of\nthe sun and the wind remitting their crime against her husband. Thus she\nbecame free to devote her malice against the State of Punishment, while\nforgiving the individuals who had but acted in obedience to the pressure\nof their infernal environment, which pressure is Sin.\n\nThis done she set about baking the three cakes against her journey to\nAngus Og.\n\nWhile she was baking the cakes, the children, Seumas and Brigid Beg,\nslipped away into the wood to speak to each other and to wonder over\nthis extraordinary occurrence.\n\nAt first their movements were very careful, for they could not be quite\nsure that the policemen had really gone away, or whether they were\nhiding in dark places waiting to pounce on them and carry them away\nto captivity. The word \"murder\" was almost unknown to them, and its\nstrangeness was rendered still more strange by reason of the nearness\nof their father to the term. It was a terrible word and its terror was\nmagnified by their father's unthinkable implication. What had he done?\nAlmost all his actions and habits were so familiar to them as to be\ncommonplace, and yet, there was a dark something to which he was a\nparty and which dashed before them as terrible and ungraspable as a\nlightning-flash. They understood that it had something to do with that\nother father and mother whose bodies had been snatched from beneath\nthe hearthstone, but they knew the Philosopher had done nothing in that\ninstance, and, so, they saw murder as a terrible, occult affair which\nwas quite beyond their mental horizons.\n\nNo one jumped out on them from behind the trees, so in a little time\ntheir confidence returned and they walked less carefully. When they\nreached the edge of the pine wood the brilliant sunshine invited them to\ngo farther, and after a little hesitation they did so. The good spaces\nand the sweet air dissipated their melancholy thoughts, and very soon\nthey were racing each other to this point and to that. Their wayward\nflights had carried them in the direction of Meehawl MacMurrachu's\ncottage, and here, breathlessly, they threw themselves under a small\ntree to rest. It was a thorn bush, and as they sat beneath it the\ncessation of movement gave them opportunity to again consider the\nterrible position of their father. With children thought cannot be\nseparated from action for very long. They think as much with their hands\nas with their heads. They have to do the thing they speak of in order\nto visualise the idea, and, consequently, Seumas Beg was soon\nreconstructing the earlier visit of the policemen to their house\nin grand pantomime. The ground beneath the thorn bush became the\nhearthstone of their cottage; he and Brigid became four policemen, and\nin a moment he was digging furiously with a broad piece of wood to find\nthe two hidden bodies. He had digged for only a few minutes when the\npiece of wood struck against something hard. A very little time sufficed\nto throw the soil off this, and their delight was great when they\nunearthed a beautiful little earthen crock filled to the brim with\nshining, yellow dust. When they lifted this they were astonished at its\ngreat weight. They played for a long time with it, letting the heavy,\nyellow shower slip through their fingers and watching it glisten in the\nsunshine. After they tired of this they decided to bring the crock home,\nbut by the time they reached the Gort na Cloca Mora they were so tired\nthat they could not carry it any farther, and they decided to leave it\nwith their friends the Leprecauns. Seumas Beg gave the taps on the tree\ntrunk which they had learned, and in a moment the Leprecaun whom they\nknew came up.\n\n\"We have brought this, sir,\" said Seumas. But he got no further, for the\ninstant the Leprecaun saw the crock he threw his arms around it and wept\nin so loud a voice that his comrades swarmed up to see what had happened\nto him, and they added their laughter and tears to his, to which chorus\nthe children subjoined their sympathetic clamour, so that a noise of\ngreat complexity rang through all the Gort.\n\nBut the Leprecauns' surrender to this happy passion was short. Hard on\ntheir gladness came remembrance and consternation; and then repentance,\nthat dismal virtue, wailed in their ears and their hearts. How could\nthey thank the children whose father and protector they had delivered\nto the unilluminated justice of humanity? that justice which demands not\natonement but punishment; which is learned in the Book of Enmity but\nnot in the Book of Friendship; which calls hatred Nature, and Love a\nconspiracy; whose law is an iron chain and whose mercy is debility\nand chagrin; the blind fiend who would impose his own blindness; that\nunfruitful loin which curses fertility; that stony heart which would\npetrify the generations of man; before whom life withers away appalled\nand death would shudder again to its tomb. Repentance! they wiped the\ninadequate ooze from their eyes and danced joyfully for spite. They\ncould do no more, so they fed the children lovingly and carried them\nhome.\n\nThe Thin Woman had baked three cakes. One of these she gave to each of\nthe children and one she kept herself, whereupon they set out upon their\njourney to Angus Og.\n\nIt was well after midday when they started. The fresh gaiety of\nthe morning was gone, and a tyrannous sun, whose majesty was almost\ninsupportable, forded it over the world. There was but little shade\nfor the travellers, and, after a time, they became hot and weary and\nthirsty--that is, the children did, but the Thin Woman, by reason of her\nthinness, was proof against every elemental rigour, except hunger, from\nwhich no creature is free.\n\nShe strode in the centre of the road, a very volcano of silence,\nthinking twenty different thoughts at the one moment, so that the\nurgency of her desire for utterance kept her terribly quiet; but against\nthis crust of quietude there was accumulating a mass of speech which\nmust at the last explode or petrify. From this congestion of thought\nthere arose the first deep rumblings, precursors of uproar, and another\nmoment would have heard the thunder of her varied malediction, but that\nBrigid Beg began to cry: for, indeed, the poor child was both tired\nand parched to distraction, and Seumas had no barrier against a similar\nsurrender, but two minutes' worth of boyish pride. This discovery\nwithdrew the Thin Woman from her fiery contemplations, and in comforting\nthe children she forgot her own hardships.\n\nIt became necessary to find water quickly: no difficult thing, for the\nThin Woman, being a Natural, was like all other creatures able to sense\nthe whereabouts of water, and so she at once led the children in a\nslightly different direction. In a few minutes they reached a well by\nthe road-side, and here the children drank deeply and were comforted.\nThere was a wide, leafy tree growing hard by the well, and in the shade\nof this tree they sat down and ate their cakes.\n\nWhile they rested the Thin Woman advised the children on many important\nmatters. She never addressed her discourse to both of them at once,\nbut spoke first to Seumas on one subject and then to Brigid on another\nsubject; for, as she said, the things which a boy must learn are not\nthose which are necessary to a girl. It is particularly important that a\nman should understand how to circumvent women, for this and the capture\nof food forms the basis of masculine wisdom, and on this subject she\nspoke to Seumas. It is, however, equally urgent that a woman should be\nskilled to keep a man in his proper place, and to this thesis Brigid\ngave an undivided attention.\n\nShe taught that a man must hate all women before he is able to love a\nwoman, but that he is at liberty, or rather he is under express command,\nto love all men because they are of his kind. Women also should love\nall other women as themselves, and they should hate all men but one man\nonly, and him they should seek to turn into a woman, because women, by\nthe order of their beings, must be either tyrants or slaves, and it is\nbetter they should be tyrants than slaves. She explained that between\nmen and women there exists a state of unremitting warfare, and that\nthe endeavour of each sex is to bring the other to subjection; but that\nwomen are possessed by a demon called Pity which severely handicaps\ntheir battle and perpetually gives victory to the male, who is thus\nconstantly rescued on the very ridges of defeat. She said to Seumas\nthat his fatal day would dawn when he loved a woman, because he would\nsacrifice his destiny to her caprice, and she begged him for love of her\nto beware of all that twisty sex. To Brigid she revealed that a woman's\nterrible day is upon her when she knows that a man loves her, for a man\nin love submits only to a woman, a partial, individual and temporary\nsubmission, but a woman who is loved surrenders more fully to the\nvery god of love himself, and so she becomes a slave, and is not alone\ndeprived of her personal liberty, but is even infected in her mental\nprocesses by this crafty obsession. The fates work for man, and\ntherefore, she averred, woman must be victorious, for those who dare to\nwar against the gods are already assured of victory: this being the\nlaw of life, that only the weak shall conquer. The limit of strength\nis petrifaction and immobility, but there is no limit to weakness, and\ncunning or fluidity is its counsellor. For these reasons, and in order\nthat life might not cease, women should seek to turn their husbands into\nwomen; then they would be tyrants and their husbands would be slaves,\nand life would be renewed for a further period.\n\nAs the Thin Woman proceeded with this lesson it became at last so\nextremely complicated that she was brought to a stand by the knots, so\nshe decided to resume their journey and disentangle her argument when\nthe weather became cooler.\n\nThey were repacking the cakes in their wallets when they observed a\nstout, comely female coming towards the well. This woman, when she drew\nnear, saluted the Thin Woman, and her the Thin Woman saluted again,\nwhereupon the stranger sat down.\n\n\"It's hot weather, surely,\" said she, \"and I'm thinking it's as much as\na body's life is worth to be travelling this day and the sun the way it\nis. Did you come far, now, ma'am, or is it that you are used to going\nthe roads and don't mind it?\"\n\n\"Not far,\" said the Thin Woman.\n\n\"Far or near,\" said the stranger, \"a perch is as much as I'd like to\ntravel this time of the year. That's a fine pair of children you have\nwith you now, ma'am.\"\n\n\"They are,\" said the Thin Woman.\n\n\"I've ten of them myself,\" the other continued, \"and I often wondered\nwhere they came from. It's queer to think of one woman making ten new\ncreatures and she not getting a penny for it, nor any thanks itself.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said the Thin Woman.\n\n\"Do you ever talk more than two words at the one time, ma'am?\" said the\nstranger.\n\n\"I do,\" said the Thin Woman.\n\n\"I'd give a penny to hear you,\" replied the other angrily, \"for a more\nbad-natured, cross-grained, cantankerous person than yourself I never\nmet among womankind. It's what I said to a man only yesterday, that thin\nones are bad ones, and there isn't any one could be thinner than you are\nyourself.\"\n\n\"The reason you say that,\" said the Thin Woman calmly, \"is because you\nare fat and you have to tell lies to yourself to hide your misfortune,\nand let on that you like it. There is no one in the world could like to\nbe fat, and there I leave you, ma'am. You can poke your finger in\nyour own eye, but you may keep it out of mine if you please, and, so,\ngood-bye to you; and if I wasn't a quiet woman I'd pull you by the hair\nof the head up a hill and down a hill for two hours, and now there's an\nend of it. I've given you more than two words; let you take care or I'll\ngive you two more that will put blisters on your body for ever. Come\nalong with me now, children, and if ever you see a woman like that woman\nyou'll know that she eats until she can't stand, and drinks until she\ncan't sit, and sleeps until she is stupid; and if that sort of person\never talks to you remember that two words are all that's due to her, and\nlet them be short ones, for a woman like that would be a traitor and a\nthief, only that she's too lazy to be anything but a sot, God help her I\nand, so, good-bye.\"\n\nThereupon the Thin Woman and the children arose, and having saluted the\nstranger they went down the wide path; but the other woman stayed where\nshe was sitting, and she did not say a word even to herself.\n\nAs she strode along the Thin Woman lapsed again to her anger, and became\nso distant in her aspect that the children could get no companionship\nfrom her; so, after a while, they ceased to consider her at all and\naddressed themselves to their play. They danced before and behind\nand around her. They ran and doubled, shouted and laughed and sang.\nSometimes they pretended they were husband and wife, and then they\nplodded quietly side by side, making wise, occasional remarks on the\nweather, or the condition of their health, or the state of the fields of\nrye. Sometimes one was a horse and the other was a driver, and then\nthey stamped along the road with loud, fierce snortings and louder and\nfiercer commands. At another moment one was a cow being driven with\ngreat difficulty to market by a driver whose temper had given way hours\nbefore; or they both became goats and with their heads jammed together\nthey pushed and squealed viciously; and these changes lapsed into one\nanother so easily that at no moment were they unoccupied. But as the\nday wore on to evening the immense surrounding quietude began to weigh\nheavily upon them. Saving for their own shrill voices there was no\nsound, and this unending, wide silence at last commanded them to a\ncorresponding quietness. Little by little they ceased their play. The\nscamper became a trot, each run was more and more curtailed in its\nlength, the race back became swifter than the run forth, and, shortly,\nthey were pacing soberly enough one on either side of the Thin Woman\nsending back and forth a few quiet sentences. Soon even these sentences\ntrailed away into the vast surrounding stillness. Then Brigid Beg\nclutched the Thin Woman's right hand, and not long after Seumas gently\nclasped her left hand, and these mute appeals for protection and comfort\nagain released her from the valleys of fury through which she had been\nso fiercely careering.\n\nAs they went gently along they saw a cow lying in a field, and, seeing\nthis animal, the Thin Woman stopped thoughtfully.\n\n\"Everything,\" said she, \"belongs to the wayfarer,\" and she crossed into\nthe field and milked the cow into a vessel which she had.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Seumas, \"who owns that cow.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Brigid Beg, \"nobody owns her at all.\"\n\n\"The cow owns herself,\" said the Thin Woman, \"for nobody can own a thing\nthat is alive. I am sure she gives her milk to us with great goodwill,\nfor we are modest, temperate people without greed or pretension.\"\n\nOn being released the cow lay down again in the grass and resumed its\ninterrupted cud. As the evening had grown chill the Thin Woman and the\nchildren huddled close to the warm animal. They drew pieces of cake from\ntheir wallets, and ate these and drank happily from the vessel of milk.\nNow and then the cow looked benignantly over its shoulder bidding them\na welcome to its hospitable flanks. It had a mild, motherly eye, and\nit was very fond of children. The youngsters continually deserted their\nmeal in order to put their arms about the cow's neck to thank and praise\nher for her goodness, and to draw each other's attention to various\nexcellences in its appearance.\n\n\"Cow,\" said Brigid Beg in an ecstasy, \"I love you.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Seumas. \"Do you notice the kind of eyes it has?\"\n\n\"Why does a cow have horns?\" said Brigid.\n\nSo they asked the cow that question, but it only smiled and said\nnothing.\n\n\"If a cow talked to you,\" said Brigid, \"what would it say?\"\n\n\"Let us be cows,\" replied Seumas, \"and then, maybe, we will find out.\"\n\nSo they became cows and ate a few blades of grass, but they found that\nwhen they were cows they did not want to say anything but \"moo,\" and\nthey decided that cows did not want to say anything more than that\neither, and they became interested in the reflection that, perhaps,\nnothing else was worth saying.\n\nA long, thin, yellow-coloured fly was going in that direction on a\njourney, and he stopped to rest himself on the cow's nose.\n\n\"You are welcome,\" said the cow.\n\n\"It's a great night for travelling,\" said the fly, \"but one gets tired\nalone. Have you seen any of my people about?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the cow, \"no one but beetles to-night, and they seldom\nstop for a talk. You've rather a good kind of life, I suppose, flying\nabout and enjoying yourself.\"\n\n\"We all have our troubles,\" said the fly in a melancholy voice, and he\ncommenced to clean his right wing with his leg.\n\n\"Does any one ever lie against your back the way these people are lying\nagainst mine, or do they steal your milk?\"\n\n\"There are too many spiders about,\" said the fly.\n\n\"No corner is safe from them; they squat in the grass and pounce on you.\nI've got a twist, my eye trying to watch them. They are ugly,\nvoracious people without manners or neighbourliness, terrible, terrible\ncreatures.\"\n\n\"I have seen them,\" said the cow, \"but they never done me any harm. Move\nup a little bit please, I want to lick my nose: it's queer how itchy my\nnose gets\"--the fly moved up a bit. \"If,\" the cow continued, \"you had\nstayed there, and if my tongue had hit you, I don't suppose you would\never have recovered.\"\n\n\"Your tongue couldn't have hit me,\" said the by. \"I move very quickly\nyou know.\"\n\nHereupon the cow slily whacked her tongue across her nose. She did not\nsee the fly move, but it was hovering safely half an inch over her nose.\n\n\"You see,\" said the fly.\n\n\"I do,\" replied the cow, and she bellowed so sudden and furious a snort\nof laughter that the fly was blown far away by that gust and never came\nback again.\n\nThis amused the cow exceedingly, and she chuckled and sniggered to\nherself for a long time. The children had listened with great interest\nto the conversation, and they also laughed delightedly, and the Thin\nWoman admitted that the fly had got the worse of it; but, after a while,\nshe said that the part of the cow's back against which she was resting\nwas bonier than anything she had ever leaned upon before, and that while\nthinness was a virtue no one had any right to be thin in lumps, and that\non this count the cow was not to be commended. On hearing this the cow\narose, and without another look at them it walked away into the dusky\nfield. The Thin Woman told the children afterwards that she was sorry\nshe had said anything, but she was unable to bring her self to apologise\nto the cow, and so they were forced to resume their journey in order to\nkeep themselves warm.\n\nThere was a sickle moon in the sky, a tender sword whose radiance stayed\nin its own high places and did not at all illumine the heavy world\nbelow; the glimmer of infrequent stars could also be seen with spacious,\ndark solitudes between them; but on the earth the darkness gathered\nin fold on fold of misty veiling, through which the trees uttered an\nearnest whisper, and the grasses lifted their little voices, and the\nwind crooned its thrilling, stern lament.\n\nAs the travellers walked on, their eyes, flinching from the darkness,\nrested joyfully on the gracious moon, but that joy lasted only for a\nlittle time. The Thin Woman spoke to them curiously about the moon,\nand, indeed, she might speak with assurance on that subject, for\nher ancestors had sported in the cold beam through countless dim\ngenerations.\n\n\"It is not known,\" said she, \"that the fairies seldom dance for joy,\nbut for sadness that they have been expelled from the sweet dawn, and\ntherefore their midnight revels are only ceremonies to remind them\nof their happy state in the morning of the world before thoughtful\ncuriosity and self-righteous moralities drove them from the kind face of\nthe sun to the dark exile of midnight. It is strange that we may not be\nangry while looking on the moon. Indeed, no mere appetite or passion of\nany kind dare become imperative in the presence of the Shining One; and\nthis, in a more limited degree, is true also of every form of beauty;\nfor there is something in an absolute beauty to chide away the desires\nof materiality and yet to dissolve the spirit in ecstasies of fear and\nsadness. Beauty has no liking for Thought, but will send terror and\nsorrow on those who look upon her with intelligent eyes. We may neither\nbe angry nor gay in the presence of the moon, nor may we dare to think\nin her bailiwick, or the Jealous One will surely afflict us. I think\nthat she is not benevolent but malign, and that her mildness is a cloak\nfor many shy infamies. I think that beauty tends to become frightful as\nit becomes perfect, and that, if we could see it comprehendingly, the\nextreme of beauty is a desolating hideousness, and that the name\nof ultimate, absolute beauty is Madness. Therefore men should seek\nloveliness rather than beauty, and so they would always have a friend\nto go beside them, to understand and to comfort them, for that is the\nbusiness of loveliness: but the business of beauty--there is no person\nat all knows what that is. Beauty is the extreme which has not yet swung\nto and become merged in its opposite. The poets have sung of this beauty\nand the philosophers have prophesied of it, thinking that the beauty\nwhich passes all understanding is also the peace which passeth\nunderstanding; but I think that whatever passes understanding, which\nis imagination, is terrible, standing aloof from humanity and from\nkindness, and that this is the sin against the Holy Ghost, the great\nArtist. An isolated perfection is a symbol of terror and pride, and\nit is followed only by the head of man, but the heart winces from it\naghast, cleaving to that loveliness which is modesty and righteousness.\nEvery extreme is bad, in order that it may swing to and fertilize its\nequally horrible opposite.\"\n\nThus, speaking more to herself than to the children, the Thin Woman\nbeguiled the way. The moon had brightened as she spoke, and on either\nside of the path, wherever there was a tree or a rise in the ground,\na black shadow was crouching tensely watchful, seeming as if it might\nspring into terrible life at a bound. Of these shadows the children\nbecame so fearful that the Thin Woman forsook the path and adventured on\nthe open hillside, so that in a short time the road was left behind and\naround them stretched the quiet slopes in the full shining of the moon.\n\nWhen they had walked for a long time the children became sleepy; they\nwere unused to being awake in the night, and as there was no place where\nthey could rest, and as it was evident that they could not walk much\nfurther, the Thin Woman grew anxious. Already Brigid had made a\ntiny, whimpering sound, and Seumas had followed this with a sigh, the\nslightest prolongation of which might have trailed into a sob, and when\nchildren are overtaken by tears they do not understand how to escape\nfrom them until they are simply bored by much weeping.\n\nWhen they topped a slight incline they saw a light shining some distance\naway, and toward this the Thin Woman hurried. As they drew near she saw\nit was a small fire, and around this some figures were seated. In a few\nminutes she came into the circle of the firelight, and here she halted\nsuddenly. She would have turned and fled, but fear loosened her knees\nso that they would not obey her will; also the people by the fire had\nobserved her, and a great voice commanded that she should draw near.\n\nThe fire was made of branches of heather, and beside it three figures\nsat. The Thin Woman, hiding her perturbation as well as she could, came\nnigh and sat down by the fire. After a low word of greeting she gave\nsome of her cake to the children, drew them close to her, wrapped her\nshawl about their heads and bade them sleep. Then, shrinkingly, she\nlooked at her hosts.\n\nThey were quite naked, and each of them gazed on her with intent\nearnestness. The first was so beautiful that the eye failed upon him,\nflinching aside as from a great brightness. He was of mighty stature,\nand yet so nobly proportioned, so exquisitely slender and graceful, that\nno idea of gravity or bulk went with his height. His face was kingly\nand youthful and of a terrifying serenity. The second man was of equal\nheight, but broad to wonderment. So broad was he that his great height\nseemed diminished. The tense arm on which he leaned was knotted and\nridged with muscle, and his hand gripped deeply into the ground. His\nface seemed as though it had been hammered from hard rock, a massive,\nblunt face as rigid as his arm. The third man can scarcely be described.\nHe was neither short nor tall. He was muscled as heavily as the second\nman. As he sat he looked like a colossal toad squatting with his arms\nabout his knees, and upon these his chin rested. He had no shape nor\nswiftness, and his head was flattened down and was scarcely wider than\nhis neck. He had a protruding dog-like mouth that twitched occasionally,\nand from his little eyes there glinted a horrible intelligence. Before\nthis man the soul of the Thin Woman grovelled. She felt herself crawling\nto him. The last terrible abasement of which humanity is capable came\nupon her: a fascination which would have drawn her to him in screaming\nadoration. Hardly could she look away from him, but her arms were about\nthe children, and love, mightiest of the powers, stirred fiercely in her\nheart.\n\nThe first man spoke to her.\n\n\"Woman,\" said he, \"for what purpose do you go abroad on this night and\non this hill?\"\n\n\"I travel, sir,\" said the Thin Woman, \"searching for the Brugh of Angus\nthe son of the Dagda Mor.\"\n\n\"We are all children of the Great Father,\" said he. \"Do you know who we\nare?\"\n\n\"I do not know that,\" said she.\n\n\"We are the Three Absolutes, the Three Redeemers, the three\nAlembics--the Most Beautiful Man, the Strongest Man and the Ugliest Man.\nIn the midst of every strife we go unhurt. We count the slain and the\nvictors and pass on laughing, and to us in the eternal order come all\nthe peoples of the world to be regenerated for ever. Why have you called\nto us?\"\n\n\"I did not call to you, indeed,\" said the Thin Woman; \"but why do you\nsit in the path so that travellers to the House of the Dagda are halted\non their journey?\"\n\n\"There are no paths closed to us,\" he replied; \"even the gods seek us,\nfor they grow weary in their splendid desolation--saving Him who liveth\nin all things and in us; Him we serve and before His awful front we\nabase ourselves. You, O Woman, who are walking in the valleys of anger,\nhave called to us in your heart, therefore we are waiting for you on the\nside of the hill. Choose now one of us to be your mate, and do not fear\nto choose, for our kingdoms are equal and our powers are equal.\"\n\n\"Why would I choose one of you,\" replied the Thin Woman, \"when I am well\nmarried already to the best man in the world?\"\n\n\"Beyond us there is no best man,\" said he, \"for we are the best in\nbeauty, and the best in strength, and the best in ugliness; there is no\nexcellence which is not contained in us three. If you are married what\ndoes that matter to us who are free from the pettiness of jealousy\nand fear, being at one with ourselves and with every manifestation of\nnature.\"\n\n\"If,\" she replied, \"you are the Absolute and are above all pettiness,\ncan you not be superior to me also and let me pass quietly on my road to\nthe Dagda!\"\n\n\"We are what all humanity desire,\" quoth he, \"and we desire all\nhumanity. There is nothing, small or great, disdained by our immortal\nappetites. It is not lawful, even for the Absolute, to outgrow Desire,\nwhich is the breath of God quick in his creatures and not to be bounded\nor surmounted by any perfection.\"\n\nDuring this conversation the other great figures had leaned forward\nlistening intently but saying nothing. The Thin Woman could feel the\nchildren like little, terrified birds pressing closely and very quietly\nto her sides.\n\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"tell me what is Beauty and what is Strength and what\nis Ugliness? for, although I can see these things, I do not know what\nthey are.\"\n\n\"I will tell you that,\" he replied--\"Beauty is Thought and Strength is\nLove and Ugliness is Generation. The home of Beauty is the head of man.\nThe home of Strength is the heart of man, and in the loins Ugliness\nkeeps his dreadful state. If you come with me you shall know all\ndelight. You shall live unharmed in the flame of the spirit, and nothing\nthat is gross shall bind your limbs or hinder your thought. You shall\nmove as a queen amongst all raging passions without torment or despair.\nNever shall you be driven or ashamed, but always you will choose your\nown paths and walk with me in freedom and contentment and beauty.\"\n\n\"All things,\" said the Thin Woman, \"must act according to the order of\ntheir being, and so I say to Thought, if you hold me against my will\npresently I will bind you against your will, for the holder of an\nunwilling mate becomes the guardian and the slave of his captive.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said he, \"and against a thing that is true I cannot\ncontend; therefore, you are free from me, but from my brethren you are\nnot free.\"\n\nThe Thin Woman turned to the second man.\n\n\"You are Strength?\" said she.\n\n\"I am Strength and Love,\" he boomed, \"and with me there is safety and\npeace; my days have honour and my nights quietness. There is no evil\nthing walks near my lands, nor is any sound heard but the lowing of my\ncattle, the songs of my birds and the laughter of my happy children.\nCome then to me who gives protection and happiness and peace, and does\nnot fail or grow weary at any time.\"\n\n\"I will not go with you,\" said the Thin Woman, \"for I am a mother and my\nstrength cannot be increased; I am a mother and my love cannot be added\nto. What have I further to desire from thee, thou great man?\"\n\n\"You are free of me,\" said the second man, \"but from my brother you are\nnot free.\"\n\nThen to the third man the Thin Woman addressed herself in terror, for to\nthat hideous one something cringed within her in an ecstasy of loathing.\nThat repulsion which at its strongest becomes attraction gripped her.\nA shiver, a plunge, and she had gone, but the hands of the children\nwithheld her while in woe she abased herself before him.\n\nHe spoke, and his voice came clogged and painful as though it urged from\nthe matted pores of the earth itself.\n\n\"There is none left to whom you may go but me only. Do not be afraid,\nbut come to me and I will give you these wild delights which have been\nlong forgotten. All things which are crude and riotous, all that is\ngross and without limit is mine. You shall not think and suffer any\nlonger; but you shall feel so surely that the heat of the sun will be\nhappiness: the taste of food, the wind that blows upon you, the ripe\nease of your body--these things will amaze you who have forgotten them.\nMy great arms about you will make you furious and young again; you shall\nleap on the hillside like a young goat and sing for joy as the birds\nsing. Leave this crabbed humanity that is barred and chained away\nfrom joy and come with me, to whose ancient quietude at the last both\nStrength and Beauty will come like children tired in the evening,\nreturning to the freedom of the brutes and the birds, with bodies\nsufficient for their pleasure and with no care for Thought or foolish\ncuriosity.\"\n\nBut the Thin Woman drew back from his hand, saying \"It is not lawful to\nturn again when the journey is commenced, but to go forward to whatever\nis appointed; nor may we return to your meadows and trees and sunny\nplaces who have once departed from them. The torments of the mind may\nnot be renounced for any easement of the body until the smoke that\nblinds us is blown away, and the tormenting flame has fitted us for that\nimmortal ecstasy which is the bosom of God. Nor is it lawful that ye\ngreat ones should beset the path of travellers, seeking to lure them\naway with cunning promises. It is only at the cross-roads ye may sit\nwhere the traveller will hesitate and be in doubt, but on the highway ye\nhave no power.\"\n\n\"You are free of me,\" said the third man, \"until you are ready to come\nto me again, for I only of all things am steadfast and patient, and\nto me all return in their seasons. There are brightnesses in my secret\nplaces in the woods, and lamps in my gardens beneath the hills, tended\nby the angels of God, and behind my face there is another face not hated\nby the Bright Ones.\"\n\nSo the three Absolutes arose and strode mightily away; and as they went\ntheir thunderous speech to each other boomed against the clouds and the\nearth like a gusty wind, and, even when they had disappeared, that great\nrumble could be heard dying gently away in the moonlit distances.\n\nThe Thin Woman and the children went slowly forward on the rugged,\nsloping way. Far beyond, near the distant summit of the hill there was a\nlight gleaming.\n\n\"Yonder,\" said the Thin Woman, \"is the Brugh of Angus Mac an Og, the\nson of the Dagda Mor,\" and toward this light she assisted the weary\nchildren.\n\nIn a little she was in the presence of the god and by him refreshed\nand comforted. She told him all that had happened to her husband and\nimplored his assistance. This was readily accorded, for the chief\nbusiness of the gods is to give protection and assistance to such of\ntheir people as require it; but (and this is their limitation) they\ncannot give any help until it is demanded, the freewill of mankind being\nthe most jealously guarded and holy principle in life; therefore, the\ninterference of the loving gods comes only on an equally loving summons.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nCAITILIN NI MURRACHU sat alone in the Brugh of Angus much as she had sat\non the hillside and in the cave of Pan, and again she was thinking. She\nwas happy now. There was nothing more she could desire, for all that the\nearth contained or the mind could describe was hers. Her thoughts were\nno longer those shy, subterranean gropings which elude the hand and the\nunderstanding. Each thought was a thing or a person, visible in its own\nradiant personal life, and to be seen or felt, welcomed or repulsed, as\nwas its due. But she had discovered that happiness is not laughter or\nsatisfaction, and that no person can be happy for themselves alone. So\nshe had come to understand the terrible sadness of the gods, and why\nAngus wept in secret; for often in the night she had heard him weeping,\nand she knew that his tears were for those others who were unhappy, and\nthat he could not be comforted while there was a woeful person or\nan evil deed hiding in the world. Her own happiness also had become\ninfected with this alien misery, until she knew that nothing was alien\nto her, and that in truth all persons and all things were her brothers\nand sisters and that they were living and dying in distress; and at\nthe last she knew that there was not any man but mankind, nor any human\nbeing but only humanity. Never again could the gratification of a desire\ngive her pleasure for her sense of oneness was destroyed--she was not an\nindividual only; she was also part of a mighty organism ordained, through\nwhatever stress, to achieve its oneness, and this great being was\nthreefold, comprising in its mighty units God and Man and Nature--the\nimmortal trinity. The duty of life is the sacrifice of self: it is to\nrenounce the little ego that the mighty ego may be freed; and, knowing\nthis, she found at last that she knew Happiness, that divine discontent\nwhich cannot rest nor be at ease until its bourne is attained and the\nknowledge of a man is added to the gaiety of a child. Angus had told her\nthat beyond this there lay the great ecstasy which is Love and God and\nthe beginning and the end of all things; for everything must come from\nthe Liberty into the Bondage, that it may return again to the Liberty\ncomprehending all things and fitted for that fiery enjoyment. This\ncannot be until there are no more fools living, for until the last fool\nhas grown wise wisdom will totter and freedom will still be invisible.\nGrowth is not by years but by multitudes, and until there is a common\neye no one person can see God, for the eye of all nature will scarcely\nbe great enough to look upon that majesty. We shall greet Happiness by\nmultitudes, but we can only greet Him by starry systems and a universal\nlove.\n\nShe was so thinking when Angus Og came to her from the fields. The god\nwas very radiant, smiling like the young morn when the buds awake, and\nto his lips song came instead of speech.\n\n\"My beloved,\" said he, \"we will go on a journey today.\"\n\n\"My delight is where you go,\" said Caitilin.\n\n\"We will go down to the world of men--from our quiet dwelling among the\nhills to the noisy city and the multitude of people. This will be our\nfirst journey, but on a time not distant we will go to them again, and\nwe will not return from that journey, for we will live among our people\nand be at peace.\"\n\n\"May the day come soon,\" said she.\n\n\"When thy son is a man he will go before us on that journey,\" said\nAngus, and Caitilin shivered with a great delight, knowing that a son\nwould be born to her.\n\nThen Angus Og put upon his bride glorious raiment, and they went out to\nthe sunlight. It was the early morning, the sun had just risen and the\ndew was sparkling on the heather and the grass. There was a keen stir\nin the air that stung the blood to joy, so that Caitilin danced in\nuncontrollable gaiety, and Angus, with a merry voice, chanted to the sky\nand danced also. About his shining head the birds were flying; for\nevery kiss he gave to Caitilin became a bird, the messengers of love and\nwisdom, and they also burst into triumphant melody, so that the quiet\nplace rang with their glee. Constantly from the circling birds one would\ngo flying with great speed to all quarters of space. These were his\nmessengers flying to every fort and dun, every rath and glen and valley\nof Eire to raise the Sluaige Shee (the Fairy Host). They were birds of\nlove that flew, for this was a hosting of happiness, and, therefore the\nShee would not bring weapons with them.\n\nIt was towards Kilmasheogue their happy steps were directed, and soon\nthey came to the mountain.\n\nAfter the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath had left the god she visited all\nthe fairy forts of Kilmasheogue, and directed the Shee who lived\nthere to be in waiting at the dawn on the summit of the mountain;\nconsequently, when Angus and Caitilin came up the hill, they found the\nsix clans coming to receive them, and with these were the people of the\nyounger Shee, members of the Tuatha da Danaan, tall and beautiful men\nand women who had descended to the quiet underworld when the pressure\nof the sons of Milith forced them with their kind enchantments and\ninvincible velour to the country of the gods.\n\nOf those who came were Aine Ni Rogail of Cnoc Aine and Ivil of Craglea,\nthe queens of North and South Munster, and Una the queen of Ormond;\nthese, with their hosts, sang upon the summit of the hill welcoming\nthe god. There came the five guardians of Ulster, the fomentors of\ncombat:--Brier Mac Belgan of Dromona Breg, Redg Rotbill from the slopes\nof Magh-Itar, Tinnel the son of Boclacthna of Slieve Edlicon, Grici of\nCruachan-Aigle, a goodly name, and Gulban Glas Mac Grici, whose dun is\nin the Ben of Gulban. These five, matchless in combat, marched up the\nhill with their tribes, shouting as they went. From north and south\nthey came, and from east and west, bright and happy beings, a multitude,\nwithout fear, without distraction, so that soon the hill was gay with\ntheir voices and their noble raiment.\n\nAmong them came the people of the Lupra, the ancient Leprecauns of\nthe world, leaping like goats among the knees of the heroes. They were\nheaded by their king Udan Mac Audain and Beg Mac Beg his tanist, and,\nfollowing behind, was Glomhar O'Glomrach of the sea, the strongest man\nof their people, dressed in the skin of a weasel; and there were also\nthe chief men of that clan, well known of old, Conan Mac Rihid, Gaerku\nMac Gairid, Mether Mac Mintan and Esirt Mac Beg, the son of Bueyen, born\nin a victory. This king was that same Udan the chief of the Lupra who\nhad been placed under bonds to taste the porridge in the great cauldron\nof Emania, into which pot he fell, and was taken captive with his wife,\nand held for five weary years, until he surrendered that which he most\nvalued in the world, even his boots: the people of the hills laugh still\nat the story, and the Leprecauns may still be mortified by it.\n\nThere came Bove Derg, the Fiery, seldom seen, and his harper the son of\nTrogain, whose music heals the sick and makes the sad heart merry; Rochy\nMac Elathan, Dagda Mor, the Father of Stars, and his daughter from the\nCave of Cruachan; Credh Mac Aedh of Raghery and Cas Corach son of the\ngreat Ollav; Mananaan Mac Lir came from his wide waters shouting louder\nthan the wind, with his daughters Cliona and Aoife and Etain Fair-Hair;\nand Coll and Cecht and Mac Greina, the Plough, the Hazel, and the Sun\ncame with their wives, whose names are not forgotten, even Banba and\nFodla and Eire, names of glory. Lugh of the Long-Hand, filled with\nmysterious wisdom, was not absent, whose father was sadly avenged on the\nsons of Turann--these with their hosts.\n\nAnd one came also to whom the hosts shouted with mighty love, even the\nSerene One, Dana, the Mother of the gods, steadfast for ever. Her breath\nis on the morning, her smile is summer. From her hand the birds of the\nair take their food. The mild ox is her friend, and the wolf trots by\nher friendly side; at her voice the daisy peeps from her cave and\nthe nettle couches his lance. The rose arrays herself in innocence,\nscattering abroad her sweetness with the dew, and the oak tree laughs\nto her in the air. Thou beautiful! the lambs follow thy footsteps, they\ncrop thy bounty in the meadows and are not thwarted: the weary men cling\nto thy bosom everlasting. Through thee all actions and the deeds of\nmen, through thee all voices come to us, even the Divine Promise and the\nbreath of the Almighty from afar laden with goodness.\n\nWith wonder, with delight, the daughter of Murrachu watched the hosting\nof the Shee. Sometimes her eyes were dazzled as a jewelled forehead\nblazed in the sun, or a shoulder-torque of broad gold flamed like a\ntorch. On fair hair and dark the sun gleamed: white arms tossed and\nglanced a moment and sank and reappeared. The eyes of those who did\nnot hesitate nor compute looked into her eyes, not appraising, not\nquestioning, but mild and unafraid. The voices of free people spoke in\nher ears and the laughter of happy hearts, unthoughtful of sin or shame,\nreleased from the hard bondage of selfhood. For these people, though\nmany, were one. Each spoke to the other as to himself, without\nreservation or subterfuge. They moved freely each in his personal whim,\nand they moved also with the unity of one being: for when they shouted\nto the Mother of the gods they shouted with one voice, and they bowed\nto her as one man bows. Through the many minds there went also one mind,\ncorrecting, commanding, so that in a moment the interchangeable and\nfluid became locked, and organic with a simultaneous understanding, a\ncollective action-which was freedom.\n\nWhile she looked the dancing ceased, and they turned their faces with\none accord down the mountain. Those in the front leaped forward, and\nbehind them the others went leaping in orderly progression.\n\nThen Angus Og ran to where she stood, his bride of Beauty \"Come,\nmy beloved,\" said he, and hand in hand they raced among the others,\nlaughing as they ran.\n\nHere there was no green thing growing; a carpet of brown turf spread\nto the edge of sight on the sloping plain and away to where another\nmountain soared in the air. They came to this and descended. In the\ndistance, groves of trees could be seen, and, very far away, the roofs\nand towers and spires of the Town of the Ford of Hurdles, and the\nlittle roads that wandered everywhere; but on this height there was only\nprickly furze growing softly in the sunlight; the bee droned his loud\nsong, the birds flew and sang occasionally, and the little streams grew\nheavy with their falling waters. A little further and the bushes were\ngreen and beautiful, waving their gentle leaves in the quietude, and\nbeyond again, wrapped in sunshine and peace, the trees looked on the\nworld from their calm heights, having no complaint to make of anything.\n\nIn a little they reached the grass land and the dance began. Hand sought\nfor hand, feet moved companionably as though they loved each other;\nquietly intimate they tripped without faltering, and, then, the loud\nsong arose--they sang to the lovers of gaiety and peace, long defrauded\n\"Come to us, ye who do not know where ye are--ye who live among\nstrangers in the house of dismay and self-righteousness. Poor, awkward\nones! How bewildered and bedevilled ye go! Amazed ye look and do not\ncomprehend, for your eyes are set upon a star and your feet move in the\nblessed kingdoms of the Shee Innocents! in what prisons are ye flung? To\nwhat lowliness are ye bowed? How are ye ground between the laws and the\ncustoms? The dark people of the Fomor have ye in thrall; and upon your\nminds they have fastened a band of lead, your hearts are hung with iron,\nand about your loins a cincture of brass impressed, woeful! Believe it,\nthat the sun does shine, the flowers grow, and the birds sing pleasantly\nin the trees. The free winds are everywhere, the water tumbles on the\nhills, the eagle calls aloud through the solitude, and his mate comes\nspeedily. The bees are gathering honey in the sunlight, the midges dance\ntogether, and the great bull bellows across the river. The crow says a\nword to his brethren, and the wren snuggles her young in the hedge....\nCome to us, ye lovers of life and happiness. Hold out thy hand--a\nbrother shall seize it from afar. Leave the plough and the cart for a\nlittle time: put aside the needle and the awl--Is leather thy brother, O\nman?... Come away! come away! from the loom and the desk, from the shop\nwhere the carcasses are hung, from the place where raiment is sold and\nthe place where it is sewn in darkness: O bad treachery! Is it for joy\nyou sit in the broker's den, thou pale man? Has the attorney enchanted\nthee?... Come away! for the dance has begun lightly, the wind is\nsounding over the hill, the sun laughs down into the valley, and the sea\nleaps upon the shingle, panting for joy, dancing, dancing, dancing for\njoy....\"\n\nThey swept through the goat tracks and the little boreens and the\ncurving roads. Down to the city they went dancing and singing; among\nthe streets and the shops telling their sunny tale; not heeding the\nmalignant eyes and the cold brows as the sons of Balor looked sidewards.\nAnd they took the Philosopher from his prison, even the Intellect of\nMan they took from the hands of the doctors and lawyers, from the sly\npriests, from the professors whose mouths are gorged with sawdust, and\nthe merchants who sell blades of grass--the awful people of the Fomor...\nand then they returned again, dancing and singing, to the country of the\ngods....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Crock of Gold, by James Stephens\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CROCK OF GOLD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1605.txt or 1605.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/0/1605/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
