FRANK BAUM\n\nAUTHOR OF THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ, DOROTHY AND THE\nWIZARD IN OZ, OZMA OF OZ, THE ROAD TO OZ,\nTHE LAND OF OZ, ETC.\n\n\nILLUSTRATED BY\nJOHN R. NEILL\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE oceans are big and broad. I believe two-thirds of the\nearth's surface is covered with water. What people inhabit\nthis water has always been a subject of curiosity to the\ninhabitants of the land. Strange creatures come from the seas\nat times, and perhaps in the ocean depths are many, more strange\nthan mortal eye has ever gazed upon.\n\nThis story is fanciful. In it the sea people talk and act\nmuch as we do, and the mermaids especially are not unlike the\nfairies with whom we have learned to be familiar. Yet they\nare real sea people, for all that, and with the exception of Zog\nthe Magician they are all supposed to exist in the ocean's depths.\n\nI am told that some very learned people deny that mermaids\nor sea-serpents have ever inhabited the oceans, but it would be\nvery difficult for them to prove such an assertion unless they had\nlived under the water as Trot and Cap'n Bill did in this story.\n\nI hope my readers who have so long followed Dorothy's\nadventures in the Land of Oz will be interested in Trot's equally\nstrange experiences. The ocean has always appealed to me as\na veritable wonderland, and this story has been suggested to me\nmany times by my young correspondents in their letters. Indeed,\na good many children have implored me to \"write something\nabout the mermaids,\" and I have willingly granted the request.\n\nHollywood, 1911.\n\nL.

Below them rolled the blue waves\nof the great Pacific. A little way behind them was the house, a neat\nframe cottage painted white and surrounded by huge eucalyptus and\npepper trees. Still farther behind that--a quarter of a mile distant\nbut built upon a bend of the coast--was the village, overlooking a\npretty bay.\n\nCap'n Bill and Trot came often to this tree to sit and watch the\nocean below them. The sailor man had one \"meat leg\" and one \"hickory\nleg,\" and he often said the wooden one was the best of the two. Once\nCap'n Bill had commanded and owned the \"Anemone,\" a trading schooner\nthat plied along the coast; and in those days Charlie Griffiths, who\nwas Trot's father, had been the Captain's mate. But ever since Cap'n\nBill's accident, when he lost his leg, Charlie Griffiths had been\nthe captain of the little schooner while his old master lived\npeacefully ashore with the Griffiths family.\n\nThis was about the time Trot was born, and the old sailor became\nvery fond of the baby girl. Her real name was Mayre, but when she\ngrew big enough to walk, she took so many busy little steps every\nday that both her mother and Cap'n Bill nicknamed her \"Trot,\" and so\nshe was thereafter mostly called.\n\nIt was the old sailor who taught the child to love the sea, to love\nit almost as much as he and her father did, and these two, who\nrepresented the \"beginning and the end of life,\" became firm friends\nand constant companions.\n\n\"Why hasn't anybody seen a mermaid and lived?\" asked Trot again.\n\n\"'Cause mermaids is fairies, an' ain't meant to be seen by us mortal\nfolk,\" replied Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"But if anyone happens to see 'em, what then, Cap'n?\"\n\n\"Then,\" he answered, slowly wagging his head, \"the mermaids give 'em\na smile an' a wink, an' they dive into the water an' gets drownded.\"\n\n\"S'pose they knew how to swim, Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"That don't make any diff'rence, Trot. The mermaids live deep down,\nan' the poor mortals never come up again.\"\n\nThe little girl was thoughtful for a moment. \"But why do folks dive\nin the water when the mermaids smile an' wink?\" she asked.\n\n\"Mermaids,\" he said gravely, \"is the most beautiful creatures in the\nworld--or the water, either. You know what they're like, Trot,\nthey's got a lovely lady's form down to the waist, an' then the\nother half of 'em's a fish, with green an' purple an' pink scales\nall down it.\"\n\n\"Have they got arms, Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"'Course, Trot; arms like any other lady. An' pretty faces that\nsmile an' look mighty sweet an' fetchin'. Their hair is long an'\nsoft an' silky, an' floats all around 'em in the water. When they\ncomes up atop the waves, they wring the water out'n their hair and\nsing songs that go right to your heart. If anybody is unlucky enough\nto be 'round jes' then, the beauty o' them mermaids an' their sweet\nsongs charm 'em like magic; so's they plunge into the waves to get\nto the mermaids. But the mermaids haven't any hearts, Trot, no\nmore'n a fish has; so they laughs when the poor people drown an'\ndon't care a fig. That's why I says, an' I says it true, that nobody\nnever sawr a mermaid an' lived to tell the tale.\"\n\n\"Nobody?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Nobody a tall.\"\n\n\"Then how do you know, Cap'n Bill?\" asked the little girl, looking\nup into his face with big, round eyes.\n\nCap'n Bill coughed. Then he tried to sneeze, to gain time. Then he\ntook out his red cotton handkerchief and wiped his bald head with\nit, rubbing hard so as to make him think clearer. \"Look, Trot; ain't\nthat a brig out there?\" he inquired, pointing to a sail far out in\nthe sea.\n\n\"How does anybody know about mermaids if those who have seen them\nnever lived to tell about them?\" she asked again.\n\n\"Know what about 'em, Trot?\"\n\n\"About their green and pink scales and pretty songs and wet hair.\"\n\n\"They don't know, I guess. But mermaids jes' natcherly has to be\nlike that, or they wouldn't be mermaids.\"\n\nShe thought this over. \"Somebody MUST have lived, Cap'n Bill,\" she\ndeclared positively. \"Other fairies have been seen by mortals; why\nnot mermaids?\"\n\n\"P'raps they have, Trot, p'raps they have,\" he answered musingly.\n\"I'm tellin' you as it was told to me, but I never stopped to\ninquire into the matter so close before. Seems like folks wouldn't\nknow so much about mermaids if they hadn't seen 'em; an' yet\naccordin' to all accounts the victim is bound to get drownded.\"\n\n\"P'raps,\" suggested Trot softly, \"someone found a fotygraph of one\nof 'em.\"\n\n\"That might o' been, Trot, that might o' been,\" answered Cap'n Bill.\n\nA nice man was Cap'n Bill, and Trot knew he always liked to explain\neverything so she could fully understand it. The aged sailor was not\na very tall man, and some people might have called him chubby, or\neven fat. He wore a blue sailor shirt with white anchors worked on\nthe corners of the broad, square collar, and his blue trousers were\nvery wide at the bottom. He always wore one trouser leg over his\nwooden limb and sometimes it would flutter in the wind like a flag\nbecause it was so wide and the wooden leg so slender. His rough\nkersey coat was a pea-jacket and came down to his waistline. In the\nbig pockets of his jacket he kept a wonderful jackknife, and his\npipe and tobacco, and many bits of string, and matches and keys and\nlots of other things. Whenever Cap'n Bill thrust a chubby hand into\none of his pockets, Trot watched him with breathless interest, for\nshe never knew what he was going to pull out.\n\nThe old sailor's face was brown as a berry. He had a fringe of hair\naround the back of his head and a fringe of whisker around the edge\nof his face, running from ear to ear and underneath his chin. His\neyes were light blue and kind in expression. His nose was big and\nbroad, and his few teeth were not strong enough to crack nuts with.\n\nTrot liked Cap'n Bill and had a great deal of confidence in his\nwisdom, and a great admiration for his ability to make tops and\nwhistles and toys with that marvelous jackknife of his. In the\nvillage were many boys and girls of her own age, but she never had\nas much fun playing with them as she had wandering by the sea\naccompanied by the old sailor and listening to his fascinating\nstories.\n\nShe knew all about the Flying Dutchman, and Davy Jones' Locker, and\nCaptain Kidd, and how to harpoon a whale or dodge an iceberg or\nlasso a seal. Cap'n Bill had been everywhere in the world, almost,\non his many voyages. He had been wrecked on desert islands like\nRobinson Crusoe and been attacked by cannibals, and had a host of\nother exciting adventures. So he was a delightful comrade for the\nlittle girl, and whatever Cap'n Bill knew Trot was sure to know in\ntime.\n\n\"How do the mermaids live?\" she asked. \"Are they in caves, or just\nin the water like fishes, or how?\"\n\n\"Can't say, Trot,\" he replied. \"I've asked divers about that, but\nnone of 'em ever run acrost a mermaid's nest yet, as I've heard of.\"\n\n\"If they're fairies,\" she said, \"their homes must be very pretty.\"\n\n\"Mebbe so, Trot, but damp. They are sure to be damp, you know.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see a mermaid, Cap'n Bill,\" said the child earnestly.\n\n\"What, an' git drownded?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"No, and live to tell the tale. If they're beautiful, and laughing,\nand sweet, there can't be much harm in them, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Mermaids is mermaids,\" remarked Cap'n Bill in his most solemn\nvoice. \"It wouldn't do us any good to mix up with 'em, Trot.\"\n\n\"May-re! May-re!\" called a voice from the house.\n\n\"Yes, Mamma!\"\n\n\"You an' Cap'n Bill come in to supper.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTHE MERMAIDS\n\n\nThe next morning, as soon as Trot had helped wipe the breakfast\ndishes and put them away in the cupboard, the little girl and Cap'n\nBill started out toward the bluff. The air was soft and warm and the\nsun turned the edges of the waves into sparkling diamonds. Across\nthe bay the last of the fisherboats was speeding away out to sea,\nfor well the fishermen knew this was an ideal day to catch rockbass,\nbarracuda and yellowtail.\n\nThe old man and the young girl stood on the bluff and watched all\nthis with interest. Here was their world. \"It isn't a bit rough this\nmorning. Let's have a boat ride, Cap'n Bill,\" said the child.\n\n\"Suits me to a T,\" declared the sailor. So they found the winding\npath that led down the face of the cliff to the narrow beach below\nand cautiously began the descent. Trot never minded the steep path\nor the loose rocks at all, but Cap'n Bill's wooden leg was not so\nuseful on a downgrade as on a level, and he had to be careful not to\nslip and take a tumble.\n\nBut by and by they reached the sands and walked to a spot just\nbeneath the big acacia tree that grew on the bluff. Halfway to the\ntop of the cliff hung suspended a little shed-like structure that\nsheltered Trot's rowboat, for it was necessary to pull the boat out\nof reach of the waves which beat in fury against the rocks at high\ntide. About as high up as Cap'n Bill could reach was an iron ring\nsecurely fastened to the cliff, and to this ring was tied a rope.\nThe old sailor unfastened the knot and began paying out the rope,\nand the rowboat came out of its shed and glided slowly downward to\nthe beach. It hung on a pair of davits and was lowered just as a\nboat is lowered from a ship's side. When it reached the sands, the\nsailor unhooked the ropes and pushed the boat to the water's edge.\nIt was a pretty little craft, light and strong, and Cap'n Bill knew\nhow to sail it or row it, as Trot might desire.\n\nToday they decided to row, so the girl climbed into the bow and her\ncompanion stuck his wooden leg into the water's edge \"so he wouldn't\nget his foot wet\" and pushed off the little boat as he climbed\naboard. Then he seized the oars and began gently paddling.\n\n\"Whither away, Commodore Trot?\" he asked gaily.\n\n\"I don't care, Cap'n. It's just fun enough to be on the water,\" she\nanswered, trailing one hand overboard. So he rowed around by the\nNorth Promontory, where the great caves were, and much as they were\nenjoying the ride, they soon began to feel the heat of the sun.\n\n\"That's Dead Man's Cave, 'cause a skellington was found there,\"\nobserved the child as they passed a dark, yawning mouth in the\ncliff. \"And that's Bumble Cave, 'cause the bumblebees make nests in\nthe top of it. And here's Smuggler's Cave, 'cause the smugglers used\nto hide things in it.\"\n\nShe knew all the caves well, and so did Cap'n Bill. Many of them\nopened just at the water's edge, and it was possible to row their\nboat far into their dusky depths.\n\n\"And here's Echo Cave,\" she continued, dreamily, as they slowly\nmoved along the coast, \"and Giant's Cave, and--oh, Cap'n Bill! Do\nyou s'pose there were ever any giants in that cave?\"\n\n\"'Pears like there must o' been, Trot, or they wouldn't o' named it\nthat name,\" he replied, pausing to wipe his bald head with the red\nhandkerchief while the oars dragged in the water.\n\n\"We've never been into that cave, Cap'n,\" she remarked, looking at\nthe small hole in the cliff--an archway through which the water\nflowed. \"Let's go in now.\"\n\n\"What for, Trot?\"\n\n\"To see if there's a giant there.\"\n\n\"Hm. Aren't you 'fraid?\"\n\n\"No, are you? I just don't b'lieve it's big enough for a giant to\nget into.\"\n\n\"Your father was in there once,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"an' he says\nit's the biggest cave on the coast, but low down. It's full o'\nwater, an' the water's deep down to the very bottom o' the ocean;\nbut the rock roof's liable to bump your head at high tide .\"\n\n\"It's low tide now,\" returned Trot. \"And how could any giant live in\nthere if the roof is so low down?\"\n\n\"Why, he couldn't, mate. I reckon they must have called it Giant's\nCave 'cause it's so big, an' not 'cause any giant man lived there.\"\n\n\"Let's go in,\" said the girl again. \"I'd like to 'splore it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" replied the sailor. \"It'll be cooler in there than out\nhere in the sun. We won't go very far, for when the tide turns we\nmightn't get out again.\" He picked up the oars and rowed slowly\ntoward the cave. The black archway that marked its entrance seemed\nhardly big enough to admit the boat at first, but as they drew\nnearer, the opening became bigger. The sea was very calm here, for\nthe headland shielded it from the breeze.\n\n\"Look out fer your head, Trot!\" cautioned Cap'n Bill as the boat\nglided slowly into the rocky arch. But it was the sailor who had to\nduck, instead of the little girl. Only for a moment, though. Just\nbeyond the opening the cave was higher, and as the boat floated into\nthe dim interior they found themselves on quite an extensive branch\nof the sea. For a time neither of them spoke and only the soft\nlapping of the water against the sides of the boat was heard. A\nbeautiful sight met the eyes of the two adventurers and held them\ndumb with wonder and delight.\n\nIt was not dark in this vast cave, yet the light seemed to come from\nunderneath the water, which all around them glowed with an exquisite\nsapphire color. Where the little waves crept up the sides of the\nrocks they shone like brilliant jewels, and every drop of spray\nseemed a gem fit to deck a queen. Trot leaned her chin on her hands\nand her elbows on her lap and gazed at this charming sight with real\nenjoyment. Cap'n Bill drew in the oars and let the boat drift where\nit would while he also sat silently admiring the scene.\n\nSlowly the little craft crept farther and farther into the dim\ninterior of the vast cavern, while its two passengers feasted their\neyes on the beauties constantly revealed. Both the old seaman and\nthe little girl loved the ocean in all its various moods. To them it\nwas a constant companion and a genial comrade. If it stormed and\nraved, they laughed with glee; if it rolled great breakers against\nthe shore, they clapped their hands joyfully; if it lay slumbering\nat their feet, they petted and caressed it, but always they loved\nit.\n\nHere was the ocean yet. It had crept under the dome of overhanging\nrock to reveal itself crowned with sapphires and dressed in azure\ngown, revealing in this guise new and unexpected charms. \"Good\nmorning, Mayre,\" said a sweet voice.\n\nTrot gave a start and looked around her in wonder. Just beside her\nin the water were little eddies--circles within circles--such as are\ncaused when anything sinks below the surface. \"Did--did you hear\nthat, Cap'n Bill?\" she whispered solemnly.\n\nCap'n Bill did not answer. He was staring with eyes that fairly\nbulged out at a place behind Trot's back, and he shook a little, as\nif trembling from cold. Trot turned half around, and then she\nstared, too. Rising from the blue water was a fair face around which\nfloated a mass of long, blonde hair. It was a sweet, girlish face\nwith eyes of the same deep blue as the water and red lips whose\ndainty smile disposed two rows of pearly teeth. The cheeks were\nplump and rosy, the brows gracefully penciled, while the chin was\nrounded and had a pretty dimple in it.\n\n\"The most beauti-ful-est in all the world,\" murmured Cap'n Bill in a\nvoice of horror, \"an' no one has ever lived to--to tell the tale!\"\n\nThere was a peal of merry laughter at this, laughter that rippled\nand echoed throughout the cavern. Just at Trot's side appeared a new\nface even fairer than the other, with a wealth of brown hair\nwreathing the lovely features. And the eyes smiled kindly into those\nof the child. \"Are you a--a mermaid?\" asked Trot curiously. She was\nnot a bit afraid. They seemed both gentle and friendly.\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" was the soft answer.\n\n\"We are all mermaids!\" chimed a laughing chorus, and here and there,\nall about the boat, appeared pretty faces lying just upon the\nsurface of the water.\n\n\"Are you part fishes?\" asked Trot, greatly pleased by this wonderful\nsight.\n\n\"No, we are all mermaid,\" replied the one with the brown hair. \"The\nfishes are partly like us, because they live in the sea and must\nmove about. And you are partly like us, Mayre dear, but have awkward\nstiff legs so you may walk on the land. But the mermaids lived\nbefore fishes and before mankind, so both have borrowed something\nfrom us.\"\n\n\"Then you must be fairies if you've lived always,\" remarked Trot,\nnodding wisely.\n\n\"We are, dear. We are the water fairies,\" answered the one with the\nblonde hair, coming nearer and rising till her slender white throat\nshowed plainly.\n\n\"We--we're goners, Trot!\" sighed Cap'n Bill with a white, woebegone\nface.\n\n\"I guess not, Cap'n,\" she answered calmly. \"These pretty mermaids\naren't going to hurt us, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" said the first one who had spoken. \"If we were wicked\nenough to wish to harm you, our magic could reach you as easily upon\nthe land as in this cave. But we love little girls dearly and wish\nonly to please them and make their lives more happy.\"\n\n\"I believe that!\" cried Trot earnestly.\n\nCap'n Bill groaned.\n\n\"Guess why we have appeared to you,\" said another mermaid, coming to\nthe side of the boat.\n\n\"Why?\" asked the child.\n\n\"We heard you say yesterday you would like to see a mermaid, and so\nwe decided to grant your wish.\"\n\n\"That was real nice of you,\" said Trot gratefully.\n\n\"Also, we heard all the foolish things Cap'n Bill said about us,\"\nremarked the brown-haired one smilingly, \"and we wanted to prove to\nhim that they were wrong.\"\n\n\"I on'y said what I've heard,\" protested Cap'n Bill. \"Never havin'\nseen a mermaid afore, I couldn't be ackerate, an' I never expected\nto see one an' live to tell the tale.\"\n\nAgain the cave rang with merry laughter, and as it died away, Trot\nsaid, \"May I see your scales, please? And are they green and purple\nand pink like Cap'n Bill said?\" They seemed undecided what to say to\nthis and swam a little way off, where the beautiful heads formed a\ngroup that was delightful to see. Perhaps they talked together, for\nthe brown-haired mermaid soon came back to the side of the boat and\nasked, \"Would you like to visit our kingdom and see all the wonders\nthat exist below the sea?\"\n\n\"I'd like to,\" replied Trot promptly, \"but I couldn't. I'd get\ndrowned.\"\n\n\"That you would, mate!\" cried Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said the mermaid. \"We would make you both like one of\nourselves, and then you could live within the water as easily as we\ndo.\"\n\n\"I don't know as I'd like that,\" said the child, \"at least for\nalways.\"\n\n\"You need not stay with us a moment longer than you please,\"\nreturned the mermaid, smiling as if amused at the remark. \"Whenever\nyou are ready to return home, we promise to bring you to this place\nagain and restore to you the same forms you are now wearing.\"\n\n\"Would I have a fish's tail?\" asked Trot earnestly.\n\n\"You would have a mermaid's tail,\" was the reply.\n\n\"What color would my scales be--pink, or purple?\"\n\n\"You may choose the color yourself.\"\n\n\"Look ahere, Trot!\" said Cap'n Bill in excitement. \"You ain't\nthinkin' o' doin' such a fool thing, are you?\"\n\n\"'Course I am,\" declared the little girl. \"We don't get such\ninv'tations every day, Cap'n, and if I don't go now I may never find\nout how the mermaids live.\"\n\n\"I don't care how they live, myself,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I jes' want\n'em to let ME live.\"\n\n\"There's no danger,\" insisted Trot.\n\n\"I do' know 'bout that. That's what all the other folks said when\nthey dove after the mermaids an' got drownded.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"I don't know who, but I've heard tell--\"\n\n\"You've heard that no one ever saw a mermaid and lived,\" said Trot.\n\n\"To tell the tale,\" he added, nodding. \"An' if we dives down like\nthey says, we won't live ourselves.\"\n\nAll the mermaids laughed at this, and the brown-haired one said,\n\"Well, if you are afraid, don't come. You may row your boat out of\nthis cave and never see us again, if you like. We merely thought it\nwould please little Mayre, and were willing to show her the sights\nof our beautiful home.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see 'em, all right,\" said Trot, her eyes glistening\nwith pleasure.\n\n\"So would I,\" admitted Cap'n Bill, \"if we would live to tell the\ntale.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe us?\" asked the mermaid, fixing her lovely eyes on\nthose of the old sailor and smiling prettily. \"Are you afraid to\ntrust us to bring you safely back?\"\n\n\"N-n-no,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"'tain't that. I've got to look after\nTrot.\"\n\n\"Then you'll have to come with me,\" said Trot decidedly, \"for I'm\ngoing to 'cept this inv'tation. If you don't care to come, Cap'n\nBill, you go home and tell mother I'm visitin' the mermaids.\"\n\n\"She'd scold me inter shivers!\" moaned Cap'n Bill with a shudder. \"I\nguess I'd ruther take my chance down below.\"\n\n\"All right, I'm ready, Miss Mermaid,\" said Trot. \"What shall I do?\nJump in, clothes and all?\"\n\n\"Give me your hand, dear,\" answered the mermaid, lifting a lovely\nwhite arm from the water. Trot took the slender hand and found it\nwarm and soft and not a bit \"fishy.\"\n\n\"My name is Clia,\" continued the mermaid, \"and I am a princess in\nour deep-sea kingdom.\"\n\nJust then Trot gave a flop and flopped right out of the boat into\nthe water. Cap'n Bill caught a gleam of pink scales as his little\nfriend went overboard, and the next moment there was Trot's face in\nthe water among those of the mermaids. She was laughing with glee as\nshe looked up into Cap'n Bill's face and called, \"Come on in, Cap'n!\nIt didn't hurt a bit!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nTHE DEPTHS OF THE DEEP BLUE SEA\n\n\nCap'n Bill stood up in the boat as if undecided what to do. Never a\nsailor man was more bewildered than this old fellow by the\nstrangeness of the adventure he had encountered. At first he could\nhardly believe it was all true and that he was not dreaming; but\nthere was Trot in the water, laughing with the mermaids and floating\ncomfortably about, and he couldn't leave his dear little companion\nto make the trip to the depths of the ocean alone.\n\n\"Take my hand, please, Cap'n Bill,\" said Princess Clia, reaching her\ndainty arm toward him; and suddenly the old man took courage and\nclasped the soft fingers in his own. He had to lean over the boat to\ndo this, and then there came a queer lightness to his legs and he\nhad a great longing to be in the water. So he gave a flop and\nflopped in beside Trot, where he found himself comfortable enough,\nbut somewhat frightened.\n\n\"Law sakes!\" he gasped. \"Here's me in the water with my rheumatics!\nI'll be that stiff termorrer I can't wiggle.\"\n\n\"You're wigglin' all right now,\" observed Trot. \"That's a fine tail\nyou've got, Cap'n, an' its green scales is jus' beautiful.\"\n\n\"Are they green, eh?\" he asked, twisting around to try to see them.\n\n\"Green as em'ralds, Cap'n. How do they feel?\"\n\n\"Feel, Trot, feel? Why, this tail beats that ol' wooden leg all\nholler! I kin do stunts now that I couldn't o' done in a thousand\nyears with ol' peg.\"\n\n\"And don't be afraid of the rheumatism,\" advised the Princess. \"No\nmermaid ever catches cold or suffers pain in the water.\"\n\n\"Is Cap'n Bill a mermaid now?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Why, he's a merMAN, I suppose,\" laughed the pretty princess. \"But\nwhen he gets home, he will be just Cap'n Bill again.\"\n\n\"Wooden leg an' all?\" inquired the child.\n\n\"To be sure, my dear.\"\n\nThe sailor was now trying his newly discovered power of swimming,\nand became astonished at the feats he could accomplish. He could\ndart this way and that with wonderful speed, and turn and dive, and\ncaper about in the water far better than he had ever been able to do\non land--even before he got the wooden leg. And a curious thing\nabout this present experience was that the water did not cling to\nhim and wet him as it had always done before. He still wore his\nflannel shirt and pea jacket and his sailor cap; but although he was\nin the water and had been underneath the surface, the cloth still\nseemed dry and warm. As he dived down and came up again, the drops\nflashed from his head and the fringe of beard, but he never needed\nto wipe his face or eyes at all.\n\nTrot, too, was having queer experiences and enjoying them. When she\nducked under water, she saw plainly everything about her as easily\nand distinctly as she had ever seen anything above water. And by\nlooking over her shoulder she could watch the motion of her new\ntail, all covered with pretty iridescent pink scales, which gleamed\nlike jewels. She wore her dress the same as before, and the water\nfailed to affect it in the least.\n\nShe now noticed that the mermaids were clothed, too, and their\nexquisite gowns were the loveliest thing the little girl had ever\nbeheld. They seemed made of a material that was like sheeny silk,\ncut low in the neck and with wide, flowing sleeves that seldom\ncovered the shapely, white arms of her new friends. The gowns had\ntrains that floated far behind the mermaids as they swam, but were\nso fleecy and transparent that the sparkle of their scales might be\nseen reaching back of their waists, where the human form ended and\nthe fish part began. The sea fairies wore strings of splendid pearls\ntwined around their throats, while more pearls were sewn upon their\ngowns for trimmings. They did not dress their beautiful hair at all,\nbut let it float around them in clouds.\n\nThe little girl had scarcely time to observe all this when the\nprincess said, \"Now, my dear, if you are ready, we will begin our\njourney, for it is a long way to our palaces.\"\n\n\"All right,\" answered Trot, and took the hand extended to her with a\ntrustful smile.\n\n\"Will you allow me to guide you, Cap'n Bill?\" asked the blonde\nmermaid, extending her hand to the old sailor.\n\n\"Of course, ma'am,\" he said, taking her fingers rather bashfully.\n\n\"My name is Merla,\" she continued, \"and I am cousin to Princess\nClia. We must all keep together, you know, and I will hold your hand\nto prevent your missing the way.\"\n\nWhile she spoke they began to descend through the water, and it grew\nquite dark for a time because the cave shut out the light. But\npresently Trot, who was eagerly looking around her, began to notice\nthe water lighten and saw they were coming into brighter parts of\nthe sea. \"We have left the cave now,\" said Clia, \"and may swim\nstraight home.\"\n\n\"I s'pose there are no winding roads in the ocean,\" remarked the\nchild, swimming swiftly beside her new friend.\n\n\"Oh yes indeed. At the bottom, the way is far from being straight or\nlevel,\" replied Clia. \"But we are in mid-water now, where nothing\nwill hinder our journey, unless--\"\n\nShe seemed to hesitate, so Trot asked, \"Unless what?\"\n\n\"Unless we meet with disagreeable creatures,\" said the Princess.\n\"The mid-water is not as safe as the very bottom, and that is the\nreason we are holding your hands.\"\n\n\"What good would that do?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"You must remember that we are fairies,\" said Princess Clia. \"For\nthat reason, nothing in the ocean can injure us, but you two are\nmortals and therefore not entirely safe at all times unless we\nprotect you.\"\n\nTrot was thoughtful for a few moments and looked around her a little\nanxiously. Now and then a dark form would shoot across their pathway\nor pass them at some distance, but none was near enough for the girl\nto see plainly what it might be. Suddenly they swam right into a big\nschool of fishes, all yellowtails and of very large size. There must\nhave been hundreds of them lying lazily in the water, and when they\nsaw the mermaids they merely wriggled to one side and opened a path\nfor the sea fairies to pass through. \"Will they hurt us?\" asked\nTrot.\n\n\"No indeed,\" laughed the Princess. \"Fishes are stupid creatures\nmostly, and this family is quite harmless.\"\n\n\"How about sharks?\" asked Cap'n Bill, who was swimming gracefully\nbeside them, his hand clutched in that of pretty Merla.\n\n\"Sharks may indeed be dangerous to you,\" replied Clia, \"so I advise\nyou to keep them at a safe distance. They never dare attempt to bite\na mermaid, and it may be they will think you belong to our band; but\nit is well to avoid them if possible.\"\n\n\"Don't get careless, Cap'n,\" added Trot.\n\n\"I surely won't, mate,\" he replied. \"You see, I didn't use to be\n'fraid o' sharks 'cause if they came near I'd stick my wooden leg at\n'em. But now, if they happens to fancy these green scales, it's all\nup with ol' Bill.\"\n\n\"Never fear,\" said Merla, \"I'll take care of you on our journey, and\nin our palaces you will find no sharks at all.\"\n\n\"Can't they get in?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"No. The palaces of the mermaids are inhabited only by themselves.\"\n\n\"Is there anything else to be afraid of in the sea?\" asked the\nlittle girl after they had swum quite a while in silence.\n\n\"One or two things, my dear,\" answered Princess Clia. \"Of course, we\nmermaids have great powers, being fairies; yet among the sea people\nis one nearly as powerful as we are, and that is the devilfish.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Trot. \"I've seen 'em.\"\n\n\"You have seen the smaller ones, I suppose, which sometimes rise to\nthe surface or go near the shore, and are often caught by\nfishermen,\" said Clia, \"but they are only second cousins of the\nterrible deep-sea devilfish to which I refer.\"\n\n\"Those ones are bad enough, though,\" declared Cap'n Bill. \"If you\nknow any worse ones, I don't want a interduction to 'em.\"\n\n\"The monster devilfish inhabit caves in the rugged, mountainous\nregions of the ocean,\" resumed the Princess, \"and they are evil\nspirits who delight in injuring all who meet them. None lives near\nour palaces, so there is little danger of your meeting any while you\nare our guests.\"\n\n\"I hope we won't,\" said Trot.\n\n\"None for me,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"Devils of any sort ought to be\ngive a wide berth, an' devilfish is worser ner sea serpents.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you know the sea serpents?\" asked Merla as if surprised.\n\n\"Not much I don't,\" answered the sailor, \"but I've heard tell of\nfolks as has seen 'em.\"\n\n\"Did they ever live to tell the tale?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he replied. \"They're jes' ORful creatures, mate.\"\n\n\"How easy it is to be mistaken,\" said Princess Clia softly. \"We know\nthe sea serpents very well, and we like them.\"\n\n\"You do!\" exclaimed Trot.\n\n\"Yes, dear. There are only three of them in all the world, and not\nonly are they harmless, but quite bashful and shy. They are\nkind-hearted, too, and although not beautiful in appearance, they do\nmany kind deeds and are generally beloved.\"\n\n\"Where do they live?\" asked the child.\n\n\"The oldest one, who is king of this ocean, lives quite near us,\"\nsaid Clia. \"His name is Anko.\"\n\n\"How old is he?\" inquired Cap'n Bill curiously.\n\n\"No one knows. He was here before the ocean came, and he stayed here\nbecause he learned to like the water better than the land as a\nhabitation. Perhaps King Anko is ten thousand years old, perhaps\ntwenty thousand. We often lose track of the centuries down here in\nthe sea.\"\n\n\"That's pretty old, isn't it?\" said Trot. \"Older than Cap'n Bill, I\nguess.\"\n\n\"Summat,\" chuckled the sailor man, \"summat older, mate, but not\nmuch. P'raps the sea serpent ain't got gray whiskers.\"\n\n\"Oh yes he has,\" responded Merla with a laugh. \"And so have his two\nbrothers, Unko and Inko. They each have an ocean of their own, you\nknow; and once every hundred years they come here to visit their\nbrother Anko. So we've seen all three many times.\"\n\n\"Why, how old are mermaids, then?\" asked Trot, looking around at the\nbeautiful creatures wonderingly.\n\n\"We are like all ladies of uncertain age,\" rejoined the Princess\nwith a smile. \"We don't care to tell.\"\n\n\"Older than Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Clia.\n\n\"But we haven't any gray whiskers,\" added Merla merrily, \"and our\nhearts are ever young.\"\n\nTrot was thoughtful. It made her feel solemn to be in the company of\nsuch old people. The band of mermaids seemed to all appearances\nyoung and fresh and not a bit as if they'd been soaked in water for\nhundreds of years. The girl began to take more notice of the sea\nmaidens following after her. More than a dozen were in the group;\nall were lovely in appearance and clothed in the same gauzy robes as\nMerla and the Princess. These attendants did not join in the\nconversation but darted here and there in sportive play, and often\nTrot heard the tinkling chorus of their laughter. Whatever doubts\nmight have arisen in the child's mind through the ignorant tales of\nher sailor friend, she now found the mermaids to be light-hearted,\njoyous and gay, and from the first she had not been in the least\nafraid of her new companions.\n\n\"How much farther do we have to go?\" asked Cap'n Bill presently.\n\n\"Are you getting tired?\" Merla inquired.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"but I'm sorter anxious to see what your palaces look\nlike. Inside the water ain't as interestin' as the top of it. It's\nfine swimmin', I'll agree, an' I like it, but there ain't nuthin'\nspecial to see that I can make out.\"\n\n\"That is true, sir,\" replied the Princess. \"We have purposely led\nyou through the mid-water hoping you would see nothing to alarm you\nuntil you get more accustomed to our ocean life. Moreover, we are\nable to travel more swiftly here. How far do you think we have\nalready come, Cap'n?\"\n\n\"Oh, 'bout two mile,\" he answered.\n\n\"Well, we are now hundreds of miles from the cave where we started,\"\nshe told him.\n\n\"You don't mean it!\" he exclaimed in wonder.\n\n\"Then there's magic in it,\" announced Trot soberly.\n\n\"True, my dear. To avoid tiring you and to save time, we have used a\nlittle of our fairy power,\" said Clia. \"The result is that we are\nnearing our home. Let us go downward a bit, now, for you must know\nthat the mermaid palaces are at the very bottom of the ocean, and in\nits deepest part.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nTHE PALACE OF QUEEN AQUAREINE\n\n\nTrot was surprised to find it was not at all dark or gloomy as they\ndescended farther into the deep sea. Things were not quite so clear\nto her eyes as they had been in the bright sunshine above the\nocean's surface, but every object was distinct nevertheless, as if\nshe saw through a pane of green-tainted glass. The water was very\nclear except for this green shading, and the little girl had never\nbefore felt so light and buoyant as she did now. It was no effort at\nall to dart through the water, which seemed to support her on all\nsides.\n\n\"I don't believe I weigh anything at all,\" she said to Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"No more do I, Trot,\" said he. \"But that's nat'ral, seein' as we're\nunder water so far. What bothers me most is how we manage to\nbreathe, havin' no gills like fishes have.\"\n\n\"Are you sure we haven't any gills?\" she asked, lifting her free\nhand to feel her throat.\n\n\"Sure. Ner the mermaids haven't any, either,\" declared Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Then,\" said Trot, \"we're breathing by magic.\"\n\nThe mermaids laughed at this shrewd remark, and the Princess said,\n\"You have guessed correctly, my dear. Go a little slower, now, for\nthe palaces are in sight.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Trot eagerly.\n\n\"Just before you.\"\n\n\"In that grove of trees?\" inquired the girl. And really, it seemed\nto her that they were approaching a beautiful grove. The bottom of\nthe sea was covered with white sand, in which grew many varieties of\nsea shrubs with branches like those of trees. Not all of them were\ngreen, however, for the branches and leaves were of a variety of\ngorgeous colors. Some were purple, shading down to a light lavender;\nand there were reds all the way from a delicate rose-pink to vivid\nshades of scarlet. Orange, yellow and blue shades were there, too,\nmingling with the sea-greens in a most charming manner. Altogether,\nTrot found the brilliant coloring somewhat bewildering.\n\nThese sea shrubs, which in size were quite as big and tall as the\ntrees on earth, were set so close together that their branches\nentwined; but there were several avenues leading into the groves,\nand at the entrance to each avenue the girl noticed several large\nfishes with long spikes growing upon their noses.\n\n\"Those are swordfishes,\" remarked the Princess as she led the band\npast one of these avenues.\n\n\"Are they dang'rous?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Not to us,\" was the reply. \"The swordfishes are among our most\nvalued and faithful servants, guarding the entrances to the gardens\nwhich surround our palaces. If any creatures try to enter uninvited,\nthese guards fight them and drive them away. Their swords are sharp\nand strong, and they are fierce fighters, I assure you.\"\n\n\"I've known 'em to attack ships, an' stick their swords right\nthrough the wood,\" said Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Those belonged to the wandering tribes of swordfishes,\" explained\nthe Princess. \"These, who are our servants, are too sensible and\nintelligent to attack ships.\"\n\nThe band now headed into a broad passage through the \"gardens,\" as\nthe mermaids called these gorgeous groves, and the great swordfishes\nguarding the entrance made way for them to pass, afterward resuming\ntheir posts with watchful eyes. As they slowly swam along the\navenue, Trot noticed that some of the bushes seemed to have fruits\ngrowing upon them, but what these fruits might be neither she nor\nCap'n Bill could guess.\n\nThe way wound here and there for some distance, till finally they\ncame to a more open space all carpeted with sea flowers of exquisite\ncolorings. Although Trot did not know it, these flowers resembled\nthe rare orchids of earth in their fanciful shapes and marvelous\nhues. The child did not examine them very closely, for across the\ncarpet of flowers loomed the magnificent and extensive palaces of\nthe mermaids.\n\nThese palaces were built of coral; white, pink and yellow being\nused, and the colors arranged in graceful designs. The front of the\nmain palace, which now faced them, had circular ends connecting the\nstraight wall, not unlike the architecture we are all familiar with;\nyet there seemed to be no windows to the building, although a series\nof archways served as doors.\n\nArriving at one of the central archways, the band of sea maidens\nseparated. Princess Clia and Merla leading Trot and Cap'n Bill into\nthe palace, while the other mermaids swam swiftly away to their own\nquarters.\n\n\"Welcome!\" said Clia in her sweet voice. \"Here you are surrounded\nonly by friends and are in perfect safety. Please accept our\nhospitality as freely as you desire, for we consider you honored\nguests. I hope you will like our home,\" she added a little shyly.\n\n\"We are sure to, dear Princess,\" Trot hastened to say.\n\nThen Clia escorted them through the archway and into a lofty hall.\nIt was not a mere grotto, but had smoothly built walls of pink coral\ninlaid with white. Trot at first thought there was no roof, for\nlooking upward she could see the water all above them. But the\nprincess, reading her thought, said with a smile, \"Yes, there is a\nroof, or we would be unable to keep all the sea people out of our\npalace. But the roof is made of glass to admit the light.\"\n\n\"Glass!\" cried the astonished child. \"Then it must be an awful big\npane of glass.\"\n\n\"It is,\" agreed Clia. \"Our roofs are considered quite wonderful, and\nwe owe them to the fairy powers of our queen. Of course, you\nunderstand there is no natural way to make glass under water.\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" said Cap'n Bill. And then he asked, \"Does your queen\nlive here?\"\n\n\"Yes. She is waiting now, in her throne room, to welcome you. Shall\nwe go in?\"\n\n\"I'd just as soon,\" replied Trot rather timidly, but she boldly\nfollowed the princess, who glided through another arch into another\nsmall room where several mermaids were reclining upon couches of\ncoral. They were beautifully dressed and wore many sparkling jewels.\n\n\"Her Majesty is awaiting the strangers, Princess Clia,\" announced\none of these. \"You are asked to enter at once.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said Clia, and once more taking Trot's hand, she led\nthe girl through still another arch, while Merla followed just\nbehind them, escorting Cap'n Bill. They now entered an apartment so\ngorgeous that the child fairly gasped with astonishment. The queen's\nthrone room was indeed the grandest and most beautiful chamber in\nall the ocean palaces. Its coral walls were thickly inlaid with\nmother-of-pearl, exquisitely shaded and made into borders and floral\ndecorations. In the corners were cabinets, upon the shelves of which\nmany curious shells were arranged, all beautifully polished. The\nfloor glittered with gems arranged in patterns of flowers, like a\nbrilliant carpet.\n\nNear the center of the room was a raised platform of mother-of-pearl\nupon which stood a couch thickly studded with diamonds, rubies,\nemeralds and pearls. Here reclined Queen Aquareine, a being so\nlovely that Trot gazed upon her spellbound and Cap'n Bill took off\nhis sailor cap and held it in his hands.\n\nAll about the room were grouped other mother-of-pearl couches, not\nraised like that of the queen, and upon each of these reclined a\npretty mermaid. They could not sit down as we do, Trot readily\nunderstood, because of their tails; but they rested very gracefully\nupon the couches with their trailing gauzy robes arranged in fleecy\nfolds.\n\nWhen Clia and Merla escorted the strangers down the length of the\ngreat room toward the royal throne, they met with pleasant looks and\nsmiles on every side, for the sea maidens were too polite to indulge\nin curious stares. They paused just before the throne, and the queen\nraised her head upon one elbow to observe them. \"Welcome, Mayre,\"\nshe said, \"and welcome, Cap'n Bill. I trust you are pleased with\nyour glimpse of the life beneath the surface of our sea.\"\n\n\"I am,\" answered Trot, looking admiringly at the beautiful face of\nthe queen.\n\n\"It's all mighty cur'ous an' strange-like,\" said the sailor slowly.\n\"I'd no idee you mermaids were like this, at all!\"\n\n\"Allow me to explain that it was to correct your wrong ideas about\nus that led me to invite you to visit us,\" replied the Queen. \"We\nusually pay little heed to the earth people, for we are content in\nour own dominions; but, of course, we know all that goes on upon\nyour earth. So when Princess Clia chanced to overhear your absurd\nstatements concerning us, we were greatly amused and decided to let\nyou see with your own eyes just what we are like.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you did,\" answered Cap'n Bill, dropping his eyes in some\nconfusion as he remembered his former description of the mermaids.\n\n\"Now that you are here,\" continued the Queen in a cordial, friendly\ntone, \"you may as well remain with us a few days and see the\nwonderful sights of our ocean.\"\n\n\"I'm much obliged to you, ma'am,\" said Trot, \"and I'd like to stay\never so much, but mother worries jus' dreadfully if we don't get\nhome in time.\"\n\n\"I'll arrange all that,\" said Aquareine with a smile.\n\n\"How?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"I will make your mother forget the passage of time so she will not\nrealize how long you are away. Then she cannot worry.\"\n\n\"Can you do that?\" inquired Trot.\n\n\"Very easily. I will send your mother into a deep sleep that will\nlast until you are ready to return home. Just at present she is\nseated in her chair by the front window, engaged in knitting.\" The\nqueen paused to raise an arm and wave it slowly to and fro. Then she\nadded, \"Now your good mother is asleep, little Mayre, and instead of\nworries I promise her pleasant dreams.\"\n\n\"Won't someone rob the house while she's asleep?\" asked the child\nanxiously.\n\n\"No, dear. My charm will protect the house from any intrusion.\"\n\n\"That's fine!\" exclaimed Trot in delight.\n\n\"It's jes' won-erful!\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I wish I knew it was so.\nTrot's mother has a awful sharp tongue when she's worried.\"\n\n\"You may see for yourselves,\" declared the Queen, and waved her hand\nagain. At once they saw before them the room in the cottage, with\nMayre's mother asleep by the window. Her knitting was in her lap,\nand the cat lay curled up beside her chair. It was all so natural\nthat Trot thought she could hear the clock over the fireplace tick.\nAfter a moment the scene faded away, when the queen asked with\nanother smile, \"Are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Oh yes!\" cried Trot. \"But how could you do it?\"\n\n\"It is a form of mirage,\" was the reply. \"We are able to bring any\nearth scene before us whenever we wish. Sometimes these scenes are\nreflected above the water so that mortals also observe them.\"\n\n\"I've seen 'em,\" said Cap'n Bill, nodding. \"I've seen mirages, but I\nnever knowed what caused 'em afore now.\"\n\n\"Whenever you see anything you do not understand and wish to ask\nquestions, I will be very glad to answer them,\" said the Queen.\n\n\"One thing that bothers me,\" said Trot, \"is why we don't get wet,\nbeing in the ocean with water all around us.\"\n\n\"That is because no water really touches you,\" explained the Queen.\n\"Your bodies have been made just like those of the mermaids in order\nthat you may fully enjoy your visit to us. One of our peculiar\nqualities is that water is never permitted to quite touch our\nbodies, or our gowns. Always there remains a very small space,\nhardly a hair's breadth, between us and the water, which is the\nreason we are always warm and dry.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Trot. \"That's why you don't get soggy or withered.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" laughed the Queen, and the other mermaids joined in her\nmerriment.\n\n\"I s'pose that's how we can breathe without gills,\" remarked Cap'n\nBill thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes. The air space is constantly replenished from the water, which\ncontains air, and this enables us to breathe as freely as you do\nupon the earth.\"\n\n\"But we have fins,\" said Trot, looking at the fin that stood upright\non Cap'n Bill's back.\n\n\"Yes. They allow us to guide ourselves as we swim, and so are very\nuseful,\" replied the Queen.\n\n\"They make us more finished,\" said Cap'n Bill with a chuckle. Then,\nsuddenly becoming grave, he added, \"How about my rheumatics, ma'am?\nAin't I likely to get stiffened up with all this dampness?\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" Aquareine answered. \"There is no such thing as\nrheumatism in all our dominions. I promise no evil result shall\nfollow this visit to us, so please be as happy and contented as\npossible.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nTHE SEA-SERPENT\n\n\nJust then Trot happened to look up at the glass roof and saw a\nstartling sight. A big head with a face surrounded by stubby gray\nwhiskers was poised just over them, and the head was connected with\na long, curved body that looked much like a sewer pipe.\n\n\"Oh, there is King Anko,\" said the Queen, following the child's\ngaze. \"Open a door and let him in, Clia, for I suppose our old\nfriend is anxious to see the earth people.\"\n\n\"Won't he hurt us?\" asked the little girl with a shiver of fear.\n\n\"Who, Anko? Oh no, my dear! We are very fond of the sea serpent, who\nis king of this ocean, although he does not rule the mermaids. Old\nAnko is a very agreeable fellow, as you will soon discover.\"\n\n\"Can he talk?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Yes indeed.\"\n\n\"And can we understand what he says?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied the Queen. \"I have given you power, while you\nremain here, to understand the language of every inhabitant of the\nsea.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" said Trot gratefully.\n\nThe Princess Clia swam slowly to one of the walls of the throne room\nwhere, at a wave of her hand, a round hole appeared in the coral.\nThe sea serpent at once observed this opening and the head left the\nroof of glass only to reappear presently at the round hole. Through\nthis he slowly crawled until his head was just beneath the throne of\nQueen Aquareine, who said to him:\n\n\"Good morning, your Majesty. I hope you are quite well?\"\n\n\"Quite well, thank your Majesty,\" answered Anko; and then he turned\nto the strangers. \"I suppose these are the earth folks you were\nexpecting?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned the Queen. \"The girl is named Mayre and the man\nCap'n Bill.\"\n\nWhile the sea serpent looked at the visitors, they ventured to look\nat him. He certainly was a queer creature, yet Trot decided he was\nnot at all frightful. His head was round as a ball, but his ears\nwere sharp-pointed and had tassels at the ends of them. His nose was\nflat, and his mouth very wide indeed, but his eyes were blue and\ngentle in expression. The white, stubby hairs that surrounded his\nface were not thick like a beard, but scattered and scraggly. From\nthe head, the long, brown body of the sea serpent extended to the\nhole in the coral wall, which was just big enough to admit it; and\nhow much more of the body remained outside the child could not tell.\nOn the back of the body were several fins, which made the creature\nlook more like an eel than a serpent.\n\n\"The girl is young and the man is old,\" said King Anko in a soft\nvoice. \"But I'm quite sure Cap'n Bill isn't as old as I am.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\" asked the sailor.\n\n\"I can't say exactly. I can remember several thousands of years\nback, but beyond that my memory fails me. How's your memory, Cap'n\nBill?\"\n\n\"You've got me beat,\" was the reply. \"I'll give in that you're older\nthan I am.\"\n\nThis seemed to please the sea serpent. \"Are you well?\" he asked.\n\n\"Pretty fair,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"How's yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm very well, thank you,\" answered Anko. \"I never remember to\nhave had a pain but three times in my life. The last time was when\nJulius Sneezer was on earth.\"\n\n\"You mean Julius Caesar,\" said Trot, correcting him.\n\n\"No, I mean Julius Sneezer,\" insisted the Sea Serpent. \"That was his\nreal name--Sneezer. They called him Caesar sometimes just because he\ntook everything he could lay hands on. I ought to know, because I\nsaw him when he was alive. Did you see him when he was alive, Cap'n\nBill?\"\n\n\"I reckon not,\" admitted the sailor.\n\n\"That time I had a toothache,\" continued Anko, \"but I got a lobster\nto pull the tooth with his claw, so the pain was soon over.\"\n\n\"Did it hurt to pull it?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Hurt!\" exclaimed the Sea Serpent, groaning at the recollection. \"My\ndear, those creatures have been called lobsters ever since! The\nsecond pain I had way back in the time of Nevercouldnever.\"\n\n\"Oh, I s'pose you mean Nebuchadnezzar,\" said Trot.\n\n\"Do you call him that now?\" asked the Sea Serpent as if surprised.\n\"He used to be called Nevercouldnever when he was alive, but this\nnew way of spelling seems to get everything mixed up. Nebuchadnezzar\ndoesn't mean anything at all, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"It means he ate grass,\" said the child.\n\n\"Oh no, he didn't,\" declared the Sea Serpent. \"He was the first to\ndiscover that lettuce was good to eat, and he became very fond of\nit. The people may have called it grass, but they were wrong. I\nought to know, because I was alive when Nevercouldnever lived. Were\nyou alive, then?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Trot.\n\n\"The pain I had then,\" remarked Anko, \"was caused by a kink in my\ntail about three hundred feet from the end. There was an old octopus\nwho did not like me, and so he tied a knot in my tail when I wasn't\nlooking.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Well, first I transformed the octopus into a jellyfish, and then I\nwaited for the tide to turn. When my tail was untied, the pain\nstopped.\"\n\n\"I--I don't understand that,\" said Trot, somewhat bewildered.\n\n\"Thank you, my dear,\" replied the Sea Serpent in a grateful voice.\n\"People who are always understood are very common. You are sure to\nrespect those you can't understand, for you feel that perhaps they\nknow more than you do.\"\n\n\"About how long do you happen to be?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"When last measured, I was seven thousand four hundred and\neighty-two feet, five inches and a quarter. I'm not sure about the\nquarter, but the rest is probably correct. Adam measured me when\nCain was a baby.\"\n\n\"Where's the rest of you, then?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Safe at home, I hope, and coiled up in my parlor,\" answered the Sea\nSerpent. \"When I go out, I usually take along only what is needed.\nIt saves a lot of bother and I can always find my way back in the\ndarkest night by just coiling up the part that has been away.\"\n\n\"Do you like to be a sea serpent?\" inquired the child.\n\n\"Yes, for I'm King of my Ocean, and there is no other sea serpent to\nimagine he is just as good as I am. I have two brothers who live in\nother oceans, but one is seven inches shorter than I am, and the\nother several feet shorter. It's curious to talk about feet when we\nhaven't any feet, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Seems so,\" acknowledged Trot.\n\n\"I feel I have much to be proud of,\" continued Anko in a dreamy\ntone. \"My great age, my undisputed sway, and my exceptional length.\"\n\n\"I don't b'lieve I'd care to live so long,\" remarked Cap'n Bill\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"So long as seven thousand four hundred and eighty-two feet, five\ninches and a quarter?\" asked the Sea Serpent.\n\n\"No, I mean so many years,\" replied the sailor.\n\n\"But what can one do if one happens to be a sea serpent?\" Anko\ninquired. \"There is nothing in the sea that can hurt me, and I\ncannot commit suicide because we have no carbolic acid or firearms\nor gas to turn on. So it isn't a matter of choice, and I'd about as\nsoon be alive as dead. It does not seem quite so monotonous, you\nknow. But I guess I've stayed about long enough, so I'll go home to\ndinner. Come and see me when you have time.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Trot, and Merla added, \"I'll take you over to his\nmajesty's palace when we go out and let you see how he lives.\"\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said Anko. And then he slowly slid out of the hole, which\nimmediately closed behind him, leaving the coral wall as solid as\nbefore.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Trot. \"King Anko forgot to tell us what his third\npain was about.\"\n\n\"So he did,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"We must ask him about that when we\nsee him. But I guess the ol' boy's mem'ry is failin', an' he can't\nbe depended on for pertic'lars.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nEXPLORING THE OCEAN\n\n\nThe queen now requested her guests to recline upon couches that they\nmight rest themselves from their long swim and talk more at their\nease. So the girl and the sailor allowed themselves to float\ndownward until they rested their bodies on two of the couches\nnearest the throne, which were willingly vacated for them by the\nmermaids who occupied them until then.\n\nThe visitors soon found themselves answering a great many questions\nabout their life on the earth, for although the queen had said she\nkept track of what was going on on the land, there were many details\nof human life in which all the mermaids seemed greatly interested.\n\nDuring the conversation several sea-maids came swimming into the\nroom bearing trays of sea apples and other fruit, which they first\noffered to the queen, and then passed the refreshments around to the\ncompany assembled. Trot and Cap'n Bill each took some, and the\nlittle girl found the fruits delicious to eat, as they had a richer\nflavor than any that grew upon land. Queen Aquareine was much\npleased when the old sailor asked for more, but Merla warned him\ndinner would soon be served and he must take care not to spoil his\nappetite for that meal. \"Our dinner is at noon, for we have to cook\nin the middle of the day when the sun is shining,\" she said.\n\n\"Cook!\" cried Trot. \"Why, you can't build a fire in the water, can\nyou?\"\n\n\"We have no need of fires,\" was the reply. \"The glass roof of our\nkitchen is so curved that it concentrates the heat of the sun's\nrays, which are then hot enough to cook anything we wish.\"\n\n\"But how do you get along if the day is cloudy, and the sun doesn't\nshine?\" inquired the little girl.\n\n\"Then we use the hot springs that bubble up in another part of the\npalace,\" Merla answered. \"But the sun is the best to cook by.\" So it\nwas no surprise to Trot when, about noon, dinner was announced and\nall the mermaids, headed by their queen and their guests, swam into\nanother spacious room where a great, long table was laid. The dishes\nwere of polished gold and dainty-cut glass, and the cloth and\nnapkins of fine gossamer. Around the table were ranged rows of\ncouches for the mermaids to recline upon as they ate. Only the\nnobility and favorites of Queen Aquareine were invited to partake of\nthis repast, for Clia explained that tables were set for the other\nmermaids in different parts of the numerous palaces.\n\nTrot wondered who would serve the meal, but her curiosity was soon\nsatisfied when several large lobsters came sliding into the room\nbackward, bearing in their claws trays loaded with food. Each of\nthese lobsters had a golden band behind its neck to show it was the\nslave of the mermaids.\n\nThese curious waiters were fussy creatures, and Trot found much\namusement in watching their odd motions. They were so spry and\nexcitable that at times they ran against one another and upset the\nplatters of food, after which they began to scold and argue as to\nwhose fault it was, until one of the mermaids quietly rebuked them\nand asked them to be more quiet and more careful.\n\nThe queen's guests had no cause to complain of the dinner provided.\nFirst the lobsters served bowls of turtle soup, which proved hot and\ndeliciously flavored. Then came salmon steaks fried in fish oil,\nwith a fungus bread that tasted much like field mushrooms. Oysters,\nclams, soft-shell crabs and various preparations of seafoods\nfollowed. The salad was a delicate leaf from some seaweed that Trot\nthought was much nicer than lettuce. Several courses were served,\nand the lobsters changed the plates with each course, chattering and\nscolding as they worked, and as Trot said, \"doing everything\nbackwards\" in their nervous, fussy way.\n\nMany of the things offered them to eat were unknown to the visitors,\nand the child was suspicious of some of them, but Cap'n Bill asked\nno questions and ate everything offered him, so Trot decided to\nfollow his example. Certain it is they found the meal very\nsatisfying, and evidently there was no danger of their being hungry\nwhile they remained the guests of the mermaids. When the fruits\ncame, Trot thought that must be the last course of the big dinner,\nbut following the fruits were ice creams frozen into the shape of\nflowers.\n\n\"How funny,\" said the child, \"to be eating ice cream at the bottom\nof the sea.\"\n\n\"Why does that surprise you?\" inquired the Queen.\n\n\"I can't see where you get the ice to freeze it,\" Trot replied.\n\n\"It is brought to us from the icebergs that float in the northern\nparts of the ocean,\" explained Merla.\n\n\"O' course, Trot. You orter thought o' that. I did,\" said Cap'n\nBill.\n\nThe little girl was glad there was no more to eat, for she was\nashamed to feel she had eaten every morsel she could. Her only\nexcuse for being so greedy was that \"ev'rything tasted just\nsplendid!\" as she told the queen.\n\n\"And now,\" said Aquareine, \"I will send you out for a swim with\nMerla, who will show you some of the curious sights of our sea. You\nneed not go far this afternoon, and when you return, we will have\nanother interesting talk together.\" So the blonde mermaid led Trot\nand Cap'n Bill outside the palace walls, where they found themselves\nin the pretty flower gardens.\n\n\"I'd feel all right, mate, if I could have a smoke,\" remarked the\nold sailor to the child, \"but that's a thing as can't be did here in\nthe water.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Merla, who overheard him.\n\n\"A pipe has to be lighted, an' a match wouldn't burn,\" he replied.\n\n\"Try it,\" suggested the mermaid. \"I do not mind your smoking at all,\nif it will give you pleasure.\"\n\n\"It's a bad habit I've got, an' I'm too old to break myself of it,\"\nsaid Cap'n Bill. Then he felt in the big pocket of his coat and took\nout a pipe and a bag of tobacco. After he had carefully filled his\npipe, rejoicing in the fact that the tobacco was not at all wet, he\ntook out his matchbox and struck a light. The match burned brightly,\nand soon the sailor was puffing the smoke from his pipe in great\ncontentment. The smoke ascended through the water in the shape of\nbubbles, and Trot wondered what anyone who happened to be floating\nupon the surface of the ocean would think to see smoke coming from\nthe water.\n\n\"Well, I find I can smoke, all right,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"but it\nbothers me to understand why.\"\n\n\"It is because of the air space existing between the water and\neverything you have about you,\" explained Merla. \"But now, if you\nwill come this way, I will take you to visit some of our neighbors.\"\nThey passed over the carpet of sea flowers, the gorgeous blossoms\nswaying on their stems as the motion of the people in the water\nabove them disturbed their repose, and presently the three entered\nthe dense shrubbery surrounding the palace. They had not proceeded\nfar when they came to a clearing among the bushes, and here Merla\npaused.\n\nTrot and Cap'n Bill paused, too, for floating in the clear water was\na group of beautiful shapes that the child thought looked like molds\nof wine jelly. They were round as a dinner plate, soft and\ntransparent, but tinted in such lovely hues that no artist's brush\nhas ever been able to imitate them. Some were deep sapphire blue;\nothers rose pink; still others a delicate topaz color. They seemed\nto have neither heads, eyes nor ears, yet it was easy to see they\nwere alive and able to float in any direction they wished to go. In\nshape they resembled inverted flowerpots, with the upper edges\nfluted, and from the centers floated what seemed to be bouquets of\nflowers.\n\n\"How pretty!\" exclaimed Trot, enraptured by the sight.\n\n\"Yes, this is a rare variety of jellyfish,\" replied Merla. \"The\ncreatures are not so delicate as they appear, and live for a long\ntime--unless they get too near the surface and the waves wash them\nashore.\"\n\nAfter watching the jellyfish a few moments, they followed Merla\nthrough the grove, and soon a low chant, like that of an Indian\nsong, fell upon their ears. It was a chorus of many small voices and\ngrew louder as they swam on. Presently a big rock rose suddenly\nbefore them from the bottom of the sea, rearing its steep side far\nup into the water overhead, and this rock was thickly covered with\ntiny shells that clung fast to its surface. The chorus they heard\nappeared to come from these shells, and Merla said to her\ncompanions, \"These are the singing barnacles. They are really very\namusing, and if you listen carefully, you can hear what they say.\"\n\nSo Trot and Cap'n Bill listened, and this is what the barnacles\nsang:\n\n  \"We went to topsy-turvy land to see a man-o'-war,\n  And we were much attached to it, because we simply were;\n  We found an anchor-ite within the mud upon the lea\n  For the ghost of Jonah's whale he ran away and went to sea.\n  Oh, it was awful!\n  It was unlawful!\n  We rallied round the flag in sev'ral millions;\n  They couldn't shake us;\n  They had to take us;\n  So the halibut and cod they danced cotillions.\"\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"I suppose they refer to the way barnacles have of clinging to\nships,\" replied Merla, \"but usually the songs mean nothing at all.\nThe little barnacles haven't many brains, so we usually find their\nsongs quite stupid.\"\n\n\"Do they write some comic operas?\" asked the child.\n\n\"I think not,\" answered the mermaid.\n\n\"They seem to like the songs themselves,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Oh yes, they sing all day long. But it never matters to them\nwhether their songs mean anything or not. Let us go in this\ndirection and visit some other sea people.\"\n\nSo they swam away from the barnacle-covered rock, and Trot heard the\nlast chorus as she slowly followed their conductor. The barnacles\nwere singing:\n\n\"Oh, very well, then, I hear the curfew,\nPlease go away and come some other day;\nGoliath tussels\nWith Samson's muscles,\nYet the muscles never fight in Oyster Bay.\"\n\n\"It's jus' nonsense!\" said Trot scornfully. \"Why don't they sing\n'Annie Laurie' or 'Home, Sweet Home' or else keep quiet?\"\n\n\"Why, if they were quiet,\" replied Merla, \"they wouldn't be singing\nbarnacles.\"\n\nThey now came to one of the avenues which led from the sea garden\nout into the broad ocean, and here two swordfishes were standing\nguard. \"Is all quiet?\" Merla asked them.\n\n\"Just as usual, your Highness,\" replied one of the guards.\n\"Mummercubble was sick this morning and grunted dreadfully, but he's\nbetter now and has gone to sleep. King Anko has been stirring around\nsome, but is now taking his after-dinner nap. I think it will be\nperfectly safe for you to swim out for a while, if you wish.\"\n\n\"Who's Mummercubble?\" asked Trot as they passed out into deep water.\n\n\"He's the sea pig,\" replied Merla. \"I am glad he's asleep, for now\nwe won't meet him.\"\n\n\"Don't you like him?\" inquired Trot.\n\n\"Oh, he complains so bitterly of everything that he bores us,\" Merla\nanswered. \"Mummercubble is never contented or happy for a single\nminute.\"\n\n\"I've seen people like that,\" said Cap'n Bill with a nod of his\nhead. \"An' they has a way of upsettin' the happiest folks they\nmeet.\"\n\n\"Look out!\" suddenly cried the mermaid. \"Look out for your fingers!\nHere are the snapping eels.\"\n\n\"Who? Where?\" asked Trot anxiously.\n\nAnd now they were in the midst of a cluster of wriggling, darting\neels which sported all around them in the water with marvelous\nactivity. \"Yes, look out for your fingers and your noses!\" said one\nof the eels, making a dash for Cap'n Bill. At first the sailor was\ntempted to put out a hand and push the creature away, but\nremembering that his fingers would thus be exposed, he remained\nquiet, and the eel snapped harmlessly just before his face and then\ndarted away.\n\n\"Stop it!\" said Merla. \"Stop it this minute, or I'll report your\nimpudence to Aquareine.\"\n\n\"Oh, who cares?\" shouted the Eels. \"We're not afraid of the\nmermaids.\"\n\n\"She'll stiffen you up again, as she did once before,\" said Merla,\n\"if you try to hurt the earth people.\"\n\n\"Are these earth people?\" asked one. And then they all stopped their\nplay and regarded Trot and Cap'n Bill with their little black eyes.\n\n\"The old polliwog looks something like King Anko,\" said one of them.\n\n\"I'm not a polliwog!\" answered Cap'n Bill angrily. \"I'm a respec'ble\nsailor man, an' I'll have you treat me decent or I'll know why.\"\n\n\"Sailor!\" said another. \"That means to float on the water--not IN\nit. What are you doing down here?\"\n\n\"I'm jes' a-visitin',\" answered Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"He is the guest of our queen,\" said Merla, \"and so is this little\ngirl. If you do not behave nicely to them, you will surely be\nsorry.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" replied one of the biggest eels, wriggling\naround in a circle and then snapping at a companion, which as\nquickly snapped out of his way. \"We know how to be polite to company\nas well as the mermaids. We won't hurt them.\"\n\n\"Come on, fellows, let's go scare old Mummercubble,\" cried another;\nand then in a flash they all darted away and left our friends to\nthemselves. Trot was greatly relieved.\n\n\"I don't like eels,\" she said.\n\n\"They are more mischievous than harmful,\" replied Merla, \"but I do\nnot care much for them myself.\"\n\n\"No,\" added Cap'n Bill, \"they ain't respec'ful.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nTHE ARISTOCRATIC CODFISH\n\n\nThe three swam slowly along, quite enjoying the cool depths of the\nwater. Every little while they met with some strange creature--or\none that seemed strange to the earth people--for although Trot and\nCap'n Bill had seen many kinds of fish, after they had been caught\nand pulled from the water, that was very different from meeting them\nin their own element, \"face to face,\" as Trot expressed it. Now that\nthe various fishes were swimming around free and unafraid in their\ndeep-sea home, they were quite different from the gasping, excited\ncreatures struggling at the end of a fishline or flopping from a\nnet.\n\nBefore long they came upon a group of large fishes lying lazily near\nthe bottom of the sea. They were a dark color upon their backs and\nsilver underneath, but not especially pretty to look at. The fishes\nmade no effort to get out of Merla's way and remained motionless\nexcept for the gentle motion of their fins and gills.\n\n\"Here,\" said the mermaid, pausing, \"is the most aristocratic family\nof fish in all the sea.\"\n\n\"What are they?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Codfish,\" was the reply. \"Their only fault is that they are too\nhaughty and foolishly proud of their pedigree.\"\n\nOverhearing this speech, one codfish said to another in a very\ndignified tone of voice, \"What insolence!\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" replied the other. \"There ought to be a law to prevent\nthese common mermaids from discussing their superiors.\"\n\n\"My sakes!\" said Trot, astonished. \"How stuck up they are, aren't\nthey?\"\n\nFor a moment the group of fishes stared at her solemnly. Then one of\nthe remarked in a disdainful manner, \"Come, my dear, let us leave\nthese vulgar creatures.\"\n\n\"I'm not as vulgar as you are!\" exclaimed Trot, much offended by\nthis speech. \"Where I come from, we only eat codfish when there's\nnothing else in the house to eat.\"\n\n\"How absurd!\" observed one of the creatures arrogantly.\n\n\"Eat codfish indeed!\" said another in a lofty manner.\n\n\"Yes, and you're pretty salty, too, I can tell you. At home you're\nnothing but a pick-up!\" said Trot.\n\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed the first fish who had spoken. \"Must we stand\nthis insulting language--and from a person to whom we have never\nbeen introduced?\"\n\n\"I don't need no interduction,\" replied the girl. \"I've eaten you,\nand you always make me thirsty.\"\n\nMerla laughed merrily at this, and the codfish said, with much\ndignity, \"Come, fellow aristocrats, let us go.\"\n\n\"Never mind, we're going ourselves,\" announced Merla, and followed\nby her guests the pretty mermaid swam away.\n\n\"I've heard tell of codfish aristocracy,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"but I\nnever knowed 'zac'ly what it meant afore.\"\n\n\"They jus' made me mad with all their airs,\" observed Trot, \"so I\ngave 'em a piece of my mind.\"\n\n\"You surely did, mate,\" said the sailor, \"but I ain't sure they\nunderstand what they're like when they're salted an' hung up in the\npantry. Folks gener'ly gets stuck-up 'cause they don't know\ntheirselves like other folks knows 'em.\"\n\n\"We are near Crabville now,\" declared Merla. \"Shall we visit the\ncrabs and see what they are doing?\"\n\n\"Yes, let's,\" replied Trot. \"The crabs are lots of fun. I've often\ncaught them among the rocks on the shore and laughed at the way they\nact. Wasn't it funny at dinnertime to see the way they slid around\nwith the plates?\"\n\n\"Those were not crabs, but lobsters and crawfish,\" remarked the\nmermaid. \"They are very intelligent creatures, and by making them\nserve us we save ourselves much household work. Of course, they are\nawkward and provoke us sometimes, but no servants are perfect, it is\nsaid, so we get along with ours as well as we can.\"\n\n\"They're all right,\" protested the child, \"even if they did tip\nthings over once in a while. But it is easy to work in a sea palace,\nI'm sure, because there's no dusting or sweeping to be done.\"\n\n\"Or scrubbin',\" added Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"The crabs,\" said Merla, \"are second cousins to the lobsters,\nalthough much smaller in size. There are many families or varieties\nof crabs, and so many of them live in one place near here that we\ncall it Crabville. I think you will enjoy seeing these little\ncreatures in their native haunts.\"\n\nThey now approached a kelp bed, the straight, thin stems of the kelp\nrunning far upward to the surface of the water. Here and there upon\nthe stalks were leaves, but Trot thought the growing kelp looked\nmuch like sticks of macaroni, except they were a rich red-brown\ncolor. It was beyond the kelp--which they had to push aside as they\nswam through, so thickly did it grow--that they came to a higher\nlevel, a sort of plateau on the ocean's bottom. It was covered with\nscattered rocks of all sizes, which appeared to have broken off from\nbig shelving rocks they observed nearby. The place they entered\nseemed like one of the rocky canyons you often see upon the earth.\n\n\"Here live the fiddler crabs,\" said Merla, \"but we must have taken\nthem by surprise, it is so quiet.\"\n\nEven as she spoke, there was a stirring and scrambling among the\nrocks, and soon scores of light-green crabs were gathered before the\nvisitors. The crabs bore fiddles of all sorts and shapes in their\nclaws, and one big fellow carried a leader's baton. The latter crab\nclimbed upon a flat rock and in an excited voice called out, \"Ready,\nnow--ready, good fiddlers. We'll play Number 19, Hail to the\nMermaids. Ready! Take aim! Fire away!\"\n\nAt this command every crab began scraping at his fiddle as hard as\nhe could, and the sounds were so shrill and unmusical that Trot\nwondered when they would begin to play a tune. But they never did;\nit was one regular mix-up of sounds from beginning to end. When the\nnoise finally stopped, the leader turned to his visitors and, waving\nhis baton toward them, asked, \"Well, what did you think of that?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" said Trot honestly. \"What's it all about?\"\n\n\"I composed it myself!\" said the Fiddler Crab. \"But it's highly\nclassical, I admit. All really great music is an acquired taste.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"It might do all right to\nstir up a racket New Year's Eve, but to call that screechin'\nmusic--\"\n\nJust then the crabs started fiddling again, harder than ever, and as\nit promised to be a long performance, they left the little creatures\nscraping away at their fiddles as if for dear life and swam along\nthe rocky canyon until, on turning a corner, they came upon a new\nand different scene.\n\nThere were crabs here, too, many of them, and they were performing\nthe queerest antics imaginable. Some were building themselves into a\npyramid, each standing on edge, with the biggest and strongest ones\nat the bottom. When the crabs were five or six rows high, they would\nall tumble over, still clinging to one another and, having reached\nthe ground, they would separate and commence to build the pyramid\nover again. Others were chasing one another around in a circle,\nalways moving backward or sidewise, and trying to play \"leapfrog\" as\nthey went. Still others were swinging on slight branches of seaweed\nor turning cartwheels or indulging in similar antics.\n\nMerla and the earth people watched the busy little creatures for\nsome time before they were themselves observed, but finally Trot\ngave a laugh when one crab fell on its back and began frantically\nwaving its legs to get right-side-up again. At the sound of her\nlaughter they all stopped their play and came toward the visitors in\na flock, looking up at them with their bright eyes in a most comical\nway.\n\n\"Welcome home!\" cried one as he turned a back somersault and knocked\nanother crab over.\n\n\"What's the difference between a mermaid and a tadpole?\" asked\nanother in a loud voice, and without a pause continued, \"Why, one\ndrops its tail and the other holds onto it. Ha, ha! Ho, ho! Hee,\nhee!\"\n\n\"These,\" said Merla, \"are the clown crabs. They are very silly\nthings, as you may already have discovered, but for a short time\nthey are rather amusing. One tires of them very soon.\"\n\n\"They're funny,\" said Trot, laughing again. \"It's almost as good as\na circus. I don't think they would make me tired, but then I'm not a\nmermaid.\"\n\nThe clown crabs had now formed a row in front of them. \"Mr.\nJohnsing,\" asked one, \"why is a mermaid like an automobile?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Tommy Blimken,\" answered a big crab in the middle of\nthe row. \"WHY do you think a mermaid is like an automobile?\"\n\n\"Because they both get tired,\" said Tommy Blimken. Then all the\ncrabs laughed, and Tommy seemed to laugh louder than the rest.\n\n\"How do the crabs in the sea know anything 'bout automobiles?\" asked\nTrot.\n\n\"Why, Tommy Blimken and Harry Hustle were both captured once by\nhumans and put in an aquarium,\" answered the mermaid. \"But one day\nthey climbed out and escaped, finally making their way back to the\nsea and home again. So they are quite traveled, you see, and great\nfavorites among the crabs. While they were on land they saw a great\nmany curious things, and so I suppose they saw automobiles.\"\n\n\"We did, we did!\" cried Harry Hustle, an awkward crab with one big\nclaw and one little one. \"And we saw earth people with legs, awfully\nfunny they were; and animals called horses, with legs; and other\ncreatures with legs; and the people cover themselves with the\nqueerest things--they even wear feathers and flowers on their heads,\nand--\"\n\n\"Oh, we know all about that,\" said Trot. \"We live on the earth\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Well, you're lucky to get off from it and into the good water,\"\nsaid the Crab. \"I nearly died on the earth; it was so stupid, dry\nand airy. But the circus was great. They held the performance right\nin front of the aquarium where we lived, and Tommy and I learned all\nthe tricks of the tumblers. Hi! Come on, fellows, and show the earth\npeople what you can do!\"\n\nAt this the crabs began performing their antics again, but they did\nthe same things over and over, so Cap'n Bill and Trot soon tired, as\nMerla said they would, and decided they had seen enough of the crab\ncircus. So they proceeded to swim farther up the rocky canyon, and\nnear its upper end they came to a lot of conch shells lying upon the\nsandy bottom. A funny-looking crab was sticking his head out from\neach of these shells.\n\n\"These are the hermit crabs,\" said one of the mermaids. \"They steal\nthese shells and live in them so no enemies can attack them.\"\n\n\"Don't they get lonesome?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Perhaps so, my dear. But they do not seem to mind being lonesome.\nThey are great cowards, and think if they can but protect their\nlives there is nothing else to care for. Unlike the jolly crabs we\nhave just left, the hermits are cross and unsociable.\"\n\n\"Oh, keep quiet and go away!\" said one of the hermit crabs in a\ngrumpy voice. \"No one wants mermaids around here.\" Then every crab\nwithdrew its head into its shell, and our friends saw them no more.\n\n\"They're not very polite,\" observed Trot, following the mermaid as\nMerla swam upward into the middle water.\n\n\"I know now why cross people are called 'crabbed,'\" said Cap'n Bill.\n\"They've got dispositions jes' like these 'ere hermit crabs.\"\n\nPresently they came upon a small flock of mackerel, and noticed that\nthe fishes seemed much excited. When they saw the mermaid, they\ncried out, \"Oh, Merla! What do you think? Our Flippity has just gone\nto glory!\"\n\n\"When?\" asked the mermaid.\n\n\"Just now,\" one replied. \"We were lying in the water, talking\nquietly together when a spinning, shining thing came along and our\ndear Flippity ate it. Then he went shooting up to the top of the\nwater and gave a flop and--went to glory! Isn't it splendid, Merla?\"\n\n\"Poor Flippity!\" sighed the mermaid. \"I'm sorry, for he was the\nprettiest and nicest mackerel in your whole flock.\"\n\n\"What does it mean?\" asked Trot. \"How did Flippity go to glory?\"\n\n\"Why, he was caught by a hook and pulled out of the water into some\nboat,\" Merla explained. \"But these poor stupid creatures do not\nunderstand that, and when one of them is jerked out of the water and\ndisappears, they have the idea he has gone to glory, which means to\nthem some unknown but beautiful sea.\"\n\n\"I've often wondered,\" said Trot, \"why fishes are foolish enough to\nbite on hooks.\"\n\n\"They must know enough to know they're hooks,\" added Cap'n Bill\nmusingly.\n\n\"Oh, they do,\" replied Merla. \"I've seen fishes gather around a hook\nand look at it carefully for a long time. They all know it is a hook\nand that if they bite the bait upon it they will be pulled out of\nthe water. But they are curious to know what will happen to them\nafterward, and think it means happiness instead of death. So finally\none takes the hook and disappears, and the others never know what\nbecomes of him.\"\n\n\"Why don't you tell 'em the truth?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Oh, we do. The mermaids have warned them many times, but it does no\ngood at all. The fish are stupid creatures.\"\n\n\"But I wish I was Flippity,\" said one of the mackerel, staring at\nTrot with his big, round eyes. \"He went to glory before I could eat\nthe hook myself.\"\n\n\"You're lucky,\" answered the child. \"Flippity will be fried in a pan\nfor someone's dinner. You wouldn't like that, would you?\"\n\n\"Flippity has gone to glory!\" said another, and then they swam away\nin haste to tell the news to all they met.\n\n\"I never heard of anything so foolish,\" remarked Trot as she swam\nslowly on through the clear, blue water.\n\n\"Yes, it is very foolish and very sad,\" answered Merla. \"But if the\nfish were wise, men could not catch them for food, and many poor\npeople on your earth make their living by fishing.\"\n\n\"It seems wicked to catch such pretty things,\" said the child.\n\n\"I do not think so,\" Merla replied laughingly, \"for they were born\nto become food for someone, and men are not the only ones that eat\nfishes. Many creatures of the sea feed upon them. They even eat one\nanother at times. And if none was ever destroyed, they would soon\nbecome so numerous that they would clog the waters of the ocean and\nleave no room for the rest of us. So after all, perhaps it is just\nas well they are thoughtless and foolish.\"\n\nPresently they came to some round balls that looked much like\nballoons in shape and were gaily colored. They floated quietly in\nthe water, and Trot inquired what they were.\n\n\"Balloonfish,\" answered Merla. \"They are helpless creatures, but\nhave little spikes all over them so their enemies dare not bite them\nfor fear of getting pricked.\"\n\nTrot found the balloonfish quite interesting. They had little dots\nof eyes and dots for mouths, but she could see no noses, and their\nfins and tails were very small.\n\n\"They catch these fish in the South Sea Islands and make lanterns of\n'em,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"They first skin 'em and sew the skin up\nagain to let it dry, and then they put candles inside, and the light\nshines through the dried skin.\"\n\nMany other curious sights they saw in the ocean that afternoon, and\nboth Cap'n Bill and Trot thoroughly enjoyed their glimpse of sea\nlife. At last Merla said it was time to return to the palace, from\nwhich she claimed they had not at any time been very far distant.\n\"We must prepare for dinner, as it will soon begin to grow dark in\nthe water,\" continued their conductor. So they swam leisurely back\nto the groves that surrounded the palaces, and as they entered the\ngardens the sun sank, and deep shadows began to form in the ocean\ndepths.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nA BANQUET UNDER WATER\n\n\nThe palaces of the mermaids were all aglow with lights as they\napproached them, and Trot was amazed at the sight.\n\n\"Where do the lamps come from?\" she asked their guide wonderingly.\n\n\"They are not lamps, my dear,\" replied Merla, much amused at this\nsuggestion. \"We use electric lights in our palaces and have done so\nfor thousands of years--long before the earth people knew of\nelectric lights.\"\n\n\"But where do you get 'em?\" inquired Cap'n Bill, who was as much\nastonished as the girl.\n\n\"From a transparent jellyfish which naturally emits a strong and\nbeautiful electric light,\" was the answer. \"We have many hundreds of\nthem in our palaces, as you will presently see.\"\n\nTheir way was now lighted by small, phosphorescent creatures\nscattered about the sea gardens and which Merla informed them were\nhyalaea, or sea glowworms. But their light was dim when compared to\nthat of the electric jellyfish, which they found placed in clusters\nupon the ceilings of all the rooms of the palaces, rendering them\nlight as day. Trot watched these curious creatures with delight, for\ndelicately colored lights ran around their bodies in every direction\nin a continuous stream, shedding splendid rays throughout the vast\nhalls.\n\nA group of mermaids met the visitors in the hall of the main palace\nand told Merla the queen had instructed them to show the guests to\ntheir rooms as soon as they arrived. So Trot followed two of them\nthrough several passages, after which they swam upward and entered a\ncircular opening. There were no stairs here, because there was no\nneed of them, and the little girl soon found herself in an upper\nroom that was very beautiful indeed.\n\nAll the walls were covered with iridescent shells, polished till\nthey resembled mother-of-pearl, and upon the glass ceiling were\nclusters of the brilliant electric jellyfish, rendering the room\nbright and cheerful with their radiance. In one corner stood a couch\nof white coral, with gossamer draperies hanging around it from the\nfour high posts. Upon examining it, the child found the couch was\ncovered with soft, amber sponges, which rendered it very comfortable\nto lie upon. In a wardrobe she found several beautiful gossamer\ngowns richly embroidered in colored seaweeds, and these Mayre was\ntold she might wear while she remained the guest of the mermaids.\nShe also found a toilet table with brushes, combs and other\nconveniences, all of which were made of polished tortoise-shell.\n\nReally, the room was more dainty and comfortable than one might\nsuppose possible in a palace far beneath the surface of the sea, and\nTrot was greatly delighted with her new quarters. The mermaid\nattendants assisted the child to dress herself in one of the\nprettiest robes, which she found to be quite dry and fitted her\ncomfortably. Then the sea-maids brushed and dressed her hair, and\ntied it with ribbons of cherry-red seaweed. Finally they placed\naround her neck a string of pearls that would have been priceless\nupon the earth, and now the little girl announced she was ready for\nsupper and had a good appetite.\n\nCap'n Bill had been given a similar room near Trot, but the old\nsailor refused to change his clothes for any others offered him, for\nwhich reason he was ready for supper long before his comrade. \"What\nbothers me, mate,\" he said to the little girl as the y swam toward\nthe great banquet hall where Queen Aquareine awaited them, \"is why\nain't we crushed by the pressin' of the water agin us, bein' as\nwe're down here in the deep sea.\"\n\n\"How's that, Cap'n? Why should we be crushed?\" she asked.\n\n\"Why, ev'r'body knows that the deeper you go in the sea, the more\nthe water presses agin you,\" he explained. \"Even the divers in their\nsteel jackets can't stand it very deep down. An' here we be, miles\nfrom the top o' the water, I s'pect, an' we don't feel crowded a\nbit.\"\n\n\"I know why,\" answered the child wisely. \"The water don't touch us,\nyou see. If it did, it might crush us, but it don't. It's always\nheld a little way off from our bodies by the magic of the fairy\nmermaids.\"\n\n\"True enough, Trot,\" declared the sailor man. \"What an idjut I was\nnot to think o' that myself!\"\n\nIn the royal banquet hall were assembled many of the mermaids,\nheaded by the lovely queen, and as soon as their earth guests\narrived, Aquareine ordered the meal to be served. The lobsters again\nwaited upon the table, wearing little white caps and aprons which\nmade them look very funny; but Trot was so hungry after her\nafternoon's excursion that she did not pay as much attention to the\nlobsters as she did to her supper, which was very delicious and\nconsisted of many courses. A lobster spilled some soup on Cap'n\nBill's bald head and made him yell for a minute, because it was hot\nand he had not expected it, but the queen apologized very sweetly\nfor the awkwardness of her servants, and the sailor soon forgot all\nabout the incident in his enjoyment of the meal.\n\nAfter the feast ended, they all went to the big reception room,\nwhere some of the mermaids played upon harps while others sang\npretty songs. They danced together, too--a graceful, swimming dance,\nso queer to the little girl that it interested and amused her\ngreatly. Cap'n Bill seemed a bit bashful among so many beautiful\nmermaids, yet he was pleased when the queen offered him a place\nbeside her throne, where he could see and hear all the delightful\nentertainment provided for the royal guests. He did not talk much,\nbeing a man of few words except when alone with Trot, but his\nlight-blue eyes were big and round with wonder at the sights he saw.\n\nTrot and the sailor man went to bed early and slept soundly upon\ntheir sponge-covered couches. The little girl never wakened until\nlong after the sun was shining down through the glass roof of her\nroom, and when she opened her eyes she was startled to find a number\nof big, small and middle-sized fishes staring at her through the\nglass. \"That's one bad thing 'bout this mermaid palace,\" she said to\nherself. \"It's too public. Ever'thing in the sea can look at you\nthrough the glass as much as it likes. I wouldn't mind fishes\nlooking at me if they hadn't such big eyes, an'--goodness me!\nThere's a monster that's all head! And there goes a fish with a sail\non its back, an' here's old Mummercubble, I'm sure, for he's got a\nhead just like a pig.\"\n\nShe might have watched the fishes on the roof for hours, had she not\nremembered it was late and breakfast must be ready. So she dressed\nand made her toilet, and swam down into the palace to find Cap'n\nBill and the mermaids politely waiting for her to join them. The sea\nmaidens were as fresh and lovely as ever, while each and all proved\nsweet tempered and merry, even at the breakfast table--and that is\nwhere people are cross, if they ever are. During the meal the queen\nsaid, \"I shall take you this morning to the most interesting part of\nthe ocean, where the largest and most remarkable sea creatures live.\nAnd we must visit King Anko, too, for the sea serpent would feel\nhurt and slighted if I did not bring my guests to call upon him.\"\n\n\"That will be nice,\" said Trot eagerly.\n\nBut Cap'n Bill asked, \"Is there any danger, ma'am?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" replied Queen Aquareine. \"I cannot say that you will\nbe exposed to any danger at all, so long as I'm with you. But we are\ngoing into the neighborhood of such fierce and even terrible beings\nwhich would attack you at once did they suspect you to be earth\npeople. So in order to guard your safety, I intend to draw the Magic\nCircle around both of you before we start.\"\n\n\"What is the Magic Circle?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"A fairy charm that prevents any enemy from touching you. No monster\nof the sea, however powerful, will be able to reach your body while\nyou are protected by the Magic Circle,\" declared the Queen.\n\n\"Oh, then I'll not be a bit afraid,\" returned the child with perfect\nconfidence.\n\n\"Am I to have the Magic Circle drawn around me, too?\" asked Cap'n\nBill.\n\n\"Of course,\" answered Aquareine. \"You will need no other protection\nthan that, yet both Princess Clia and I will both be with you. For\ntoday I shall leave Merla to rule our palaces in my place until we\nreturn.\"\n\nNo sooner was breakfast finished than Trot was anxious to start. The\ngirl was also curious to discover what the powerful Magic Circle\nmight prove to be, but she was a little disappointed in the\nceremony. The queen merely grasped her fairy wand in her right hand\nand swam around the child in a circle, from left to right. Then she\ntook her wand in her left hand and swam around Trot in another\ncircle, from right to left. \"Now, my dear,\" said she, \"you are safe\nfrom any creature we are liable to meet.\"\n\nShe performed the same ceremony for Cap'n Bill, who was doubtful\nabout the Magic Circle because he felt the same after it as he had\nbefore. But he said nothing of his unbelief, and soon they left the\npalace and started upon their journey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nTHE BASHFUL OCTOPUS\n\n\nIt was a lovely day, and the sea was like azure under the rays of\nthe sun.\n\nOver the flower beds and through the gardens they swam, emerging\ninto the open sea in a direction opposite that taken by the visitors\nthe day before. The party consisted of but four: Queen Aquareine,\nPrincess Clia, Trot and Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"People who live upon the land know only those sea creatures which\nthey are able to catch in nets or upon hooks or those which become\ndisabled and are washed ashore,\" remarked the Queen as they swam\nswiftly through the clear water. \"And those who sail in ships see\nonly the creatures who chance to come to the surface. But in the\ndeep ocean caverns are queer beings that no mortal has ever heard of\nor beheld, and some of these we are to visit. We shall also see some\nsea shrubs and flowering weeds which are sure to delight you with\ntheir beauty.\"\n\nThe sights really began before they had gone very far from the\npalace, and a school of butterfly fish, having gorgeous colors\nspattered over their broad wings, was first to delight the\nstrangers. They swam just as butterflies fly, with a darting, jerky\nmotion, and called a merry \"Good morning!\" to the mermaids as they\npassed.\n\n\"These butterfly fish are remarkably active,\" said the Princess,\n\"and their quick motions protect them from their enemies. We like to\nmeet them; they are always so gay and good-natured.\"\n\n\"Why, so am I!\" cried a sharp voice just beside them, and they all\npaused to discover what creature had spoken to them.\n\n\"Take care,\" said Clia in a low voice. \"It's an octopus.\"\n\nTrot looked eagerly around. A long, brown arm stretched across their\nway in front and another just behind them, but that did not worry\nher. The octopus himself came slowly sliding up to them and proved\nto be well worth looking at. He wore a red coat with brass buttons,\nand a silk hat was tipped over one ear. His eyes were somewhat dull\nand watery, and he had a moustache of long, hair-like \"feelers\" that\ncurled stiffly at the ends. When he tried to smile at them, he\nshowed two rows of sharp, white teeth. In spite of his red coat and\nyellow-embroidered vest, his standing collar and carefully tied\ncravat, the legs of the octopus were bare, and Trot noticed he used\nsome of his legs for arms, as in one of them was held a slender cane\nand in another a handkerchief.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said the Octopus. \"Are you all dumb? Or don't you know\nenough to be civil when you meet a neighbor?\"\n\n\"We know how to be civil to our friends,\" replied Trot, who did not\nlike the way he spoke.\n\n\"Well, are we not friends, then?\" asked the Octopus in an airy tone\nof voice.\n\n\"I think not,\" said the little girl. \"Octopuses are horrid\ncreatures.\"\n\n\"OctoPI, if you please; octoPI,\" said the monster with a laugh.\n\n\"I don't see any pie that pleases me,\" replied Trot, beginning to\nget angry.\n\n\"OctoPUS means one of us; two or more are called octoPI,\" remarked\nthe creature, as if correcting her speech.\n\n\"I suppose a lot of you would be a whole bakery!\" she said\nscornfully.\n\n\"Our name is Latin. It was given to us by learned scientists years\nago,\" said the Octopus.\n\n\"That's true enough,\" agreed Cap'n Bill. \"The learned scientists\nnamed ev'ry blamed thing they come across, an' gener'ly they picked\nout names as nobody could understand or pernounce.\"\n\n\"That isn't our fault, sir,\" said the Octopus. \"Indeed, it's pretty\nhard for us to go through life with such terrible names. Think of\nthe poor little seahorse. He used to be a merry and cheerful fellow,\nbut since they named him 'hippocampus' he hasn't smiled once.\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Trot. \"I don't like to 'sociate with octopuses.\"\n\n\"OctoPI,\" said the creature, again correcting her.\n\n\"You're jus' as horrid whether you're puses or pies,\" she declared.\n\n\"Horrid!\" cried the monster in a shocked tone of voice.\n\n\"Not only horrid, but horrible!\" persisted the girl.\n\n\"May I ask in what way?\" he inquired, and it was easy to see he was\noffended.\n\n\"Why, ev'rybody knows that octopuses are jus' wicked an' deceitful,\"\nshe said. \"Up on the earth, where I live, we call the Stannerd Oil\nCompany an octopus, an' the Coal Trust an octopus, an'--\"\n\n\"Stop, stop!\" cried the monster in a pleading voice. \"Do you mean to\ntell me that the earth people whom I have always respected compare\nme to the Stannerd Oil Company?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Trot positively.\n\n\"Oh, what a disgrace! What a cruel, direful, dreadful disgrace!\"\nmoaned the Octopus, drooping his head in shame, and Trot could see\ngreat tears falling down his cheeks.\n\n\"This comes of having a bad name,\" said the Queen gently, for she\nwas moved by the monster's grief.\n\n\"It is unjust! It is cruel and unjust!\" sobbed the creature\nmournfully. \"Just because we have several long arms and take\nwhatever we can reach, they accuse us of being like--like--oh, I\ncannot say it! It is too shameful, too humiliating.\"\n\n\"Come, let's go,\" said Trot again. So they left the poor octopus\nweeping and wiping his watery eyes with his handkerchief and swam on\ntheir way. \"I'm not a bit sorry for him,\" remarked the child, \"for\nhis legs remind me of serpents.\"\n\n\"So they do me,\" agreed Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"But the octopi are not very bad,\" said the Princess, \"and we get\nalong with them much better than we do with their cousins, the sea\ndevils.\"\n\n\"Oh. Are the sea devils their cousins?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Yes, and they are the only creatures of the ocean which we greatly\nfear,\" replied Aquareine. \"I hope we shall meet none today, for we\nare going near to the dismal caverns where they live.\"\n\n\"What are the sea devils like, ma'am?\" inquired Cap'n Bill a little\nuneasily.\n\n\"Something like the octopus you just saw, only much larger and of a\nbright scarlet color, striped with black,\" answered the Queen. \"They\nare very fierce and terrible creatures and nearly as much dreaded by\nthe inhabitants of the ocean as is Zog, and nearly as powerful as\nKing Anko himself.\"\n\n\"Zog! Who is Zog?\" questioned the girl. \"I haven't heard of him\nbefore now.\"\n\n\"We do not like to mention Zog's name,\" responded the Queen in a low\nvoice. \"He is the wicked genius of the sea, and a magician of great\npower.\"\n\n\"What's he like?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"He is a dreadful creature, part fish, part man, part beast and part\nserpent. Centuries ago they cast him off the earth into the sea,\nwhere he has caused much trouble. Once he waged a terrible war\nagainst King Anko, but the sea serpent finally conquered Zog and\ndrove the magician into his castle, where he now stays shut up. For\nif ever Anko catches the monster outside of his enchanted castle, he\nwill kill him, and Zog knows that very well.\"\n\n\"Seems like you have your troubles down here just as we do on top\nthe ground,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"But I'm glad old Zog is shut up in his castle,\" added Trot. \"Is it\na sea castle like your own palace?\"\n\n\"I cannot say, my dear, for the enchantment makes it invisible to\nall eyes but those of its inhabitants,\" replied Aquareine. \"No one\nsees Zog now, and we scarcely ever hear of him, but all the sea\npeople know he is here someplace and fear his power. Even in the old\ndays, before Anko conquered him, Zog was the enemy of the mermaids,\nas he was of all the good and respectable seafolk. But do not worry\nabout the magician, I beg of you, for he has not dared to do an evil\ndeed in many, many years.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not afraid,\" asserted Trot.\n\n\"I'm glad of that,\" said the Queen. \"Keep together, friends, and be\ncareful not to separate, for here comes an army of sawfishes.\"\n\nEven as Aquareine spoke, they saw a swirl and commotion in the water\nahead of them, while a sound like a muffled roar fell upon their\nears. Then swiftly there dashed upon them a group of great fishes\nwith long saws sticking out in front of their noses, armed with\nsharp, hooked teeth, all set in a row. They were larger than the\nswordfishes and seemed more fierce and bold. But the mermaids and\nTrot and Cap'n Bill quietly awaited their attack, and instead of\ntearing them with their saws as they expected to do, the fishes were\nunable to touch them at all. They tried every possible way to get at\ntheir proposed victims, but the Magic Circle was all powerful and\nturned aside the ugly saws; so our friends were not disturbed at\nall. Seeing this, the sawfishes soon abandoned the attempt and with\ngrowls and roars of disappointment swam away and were quickly out of\nsight.\n\nTrot had been a wee bit frightened during the attack, but now she\nlaughed gleefully and told the queen that it seemed very nice to be\nprotected by fairy powers. The water grew a darker blue as they\ndescended into its depths, farther and farther away from the rays of\nthe sun. Trot was surprised to find she could see so plainly through\nthe high wall of water above her, but the sun was able to shoot its\nbeams straight down through the transparent sea, and they seemed to\npenetrate to every nook and crevice of the rocky bottom.\n\nIn this deeper part of the ocean some of the fishes had a\nphosphorescent light of their own, and these could be seen far ahead\nas if they were lanterns. The explorers met a school of argonauts\ngoing up to the surface for a sail, and the child watched these\nstrange creatures with much curiosity. The argonauts live in shells\nin which they are able to hide in case of danger from prowling wolf\nfishes, but otherwise they crawl out and carry their shells like\nhumps upon their backs. Then they spread their skinny sails above\nthem and sail away under water till they come to the surface, where\nthey float and let the currents of air carry them along the same as\nthe currents of water had done before. Trot thought the argonauts\ncomical little creatures, with their big eyes and sharp noses, and\nto her they looked like a fleet of tiny ships.\n\nIt is said that men got their first idea of boats and of how to sail\nthem from watching these little argonauts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nTHE UNDISCOVERED ISLAND\n\n\nIn following the fleet of argonauts, the four explorers had risen\nhigher in the water and soon found they had wandered to an open\nspace that seemed to Trot like the flat top of a high hill. The\nsands were covered with a growth of weeds so gorgeously colored that\none who had never peered beneath the surface of the sea would\nscarcely believe they were not the product of a dye shop. Every\nknown hue seemed represented in the delicate, fern-like leaves that\nswayed softly to and fro as the current moved them. They were not\nset close together, these branches of magnificent hues, but were\nscattered sparsely over the sandy bottom of the sea so that while\nfrom a distance they seemed thick, a nearer view found them spread\nout with ample spaces of sand between them.\n\nIn these sandy spaces lay the real attractiveness of the place, for\nhere were many of those wonders of the deep that have surprised and\ninterested people in all ages.\n\nFirst were the starfishes--hundreds of them, it seemed--lying\nsleepily on the bottom, with their five or six points extended\noutward. They were of various colors, some rich and brilliant,\nothers of dark brown hues. A few had wound their arms around the\nweeds or were creeping slowly from one place to another, in the\nlatter case turning their points downward and using them as legs.\nBut most of them were lying motionless, and as Trot looked down upon\nthem she thought they resembled stars in the sky on a bright night,\nexcept that the blue of the heavens was here replaced by the white\nsand, and the twinkling diamond stars by the colored starfish.\n\n\"We are near an island,\" said the Queen, \"and that is why so many\nstarfishes are here, as they love to keep close to shore. Also the\nlittle seahorses love these weeds, and to me they are more\ninteresting than the starfish.\"\n\nTrot now noticed the seahorses for the first time. They were quite\nsmall--merely two or three inches high--but had funny little heads\nthat were shaped much like the head of a horse, and bright,\nintelligent eyes. They had no legs, though, for their bodies ended\nin tails which they twined around the stems of seaweeds to support\nthemselves and keep the currents from carrying them away.\n\nTrot bent down close to examine one of the queer little creatures\nand exclaimed, \"Why, the seahorses haven't any fins or anything to\nswim with.\"\n\n\"Oh yes we have,\" replied the Sea Horse in a tiny but distinct\nvoice. \"These things on the side of my head are fins.\"\n\n\"I thought they were ears,\" said the girl.\n\n\"So they are. Fins and ears at the same time,\" answered the little\nsea animal. \"Also, there are small fins on our backs. Of course, we\ncan't swim as the mermaids do, or even as swiftly as fishes; but we\nmanage to get around, thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't the fishes catch and eat you?\" inquired Trot curiously.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" admitted the Sea Horse, \"and there are many other\nliving things that have a way of destroying us. But here I am, as\nyou see, over six weeks old, and during that time I have escaped\nevery danger. That isn't so bad, is it?\"\n\n\"Phoo!\" said a Starfish lying near. \"I'm over three months old.\nYou're a mere baby, Sea Horse.\"\n\n\"I'm not!\" cried the Sea Horse excitedly. \"I'm full-grown and may\nlive to be as old as you are!\"\n\n\"Not if I keep on living,\" said the Starfish calmly, and Trot knew\nhe was correct in his statement.\n\nThe little girl now noticed several sea spiders creeping around and\ndrew back because she did not think them very pretty. They were\nshaped not unlike the starfishes, but had slender legs and big heads\nwith wicked-looking eyes sticking out of them.\n\n\"Oh, I don't like those things!\" said Trot, coming closer to her\ncompanions.\n\n\"You don't, eh?\" said a big Sea Spider in a cross voice. \"Why do you\ncome around here, then, scaring away my dinner when you're not\nwanted?\"\n\n\"It isn't YOUR ocean,\" replied Trot.\n\n\"No, and it isn't yours,\" snapped the Spider. \"But as it's big\nenough for us both, I'd like you to go away.\"\n\n\"So we will,\" said Aquareine gently, and at once she moved toward\nthe surface of the water. Trot and Cap'n Bill followed, with Clia,\nand the child asked, \"What island are we near?\"\n\n\"It has no name,\" answered the Queen, \"for it is not inhabited by\nman, nor has it ever yet been discovered by them. Perhaps you will\nbe the first humans to see this island. But it is a barren, rocky\nplace, and only fit for seals and turtles.\"\n\n\"Are any of them there now?\" Cap'n Bill inquired.\n\n\"I think so. We will see.\"\n\nTrot was astonished to find how near they were to the \"top\" of the\nocean, for they had not ascended through the water very long when\nsuddenly her head popped into the air, and she gave a gasp of\nsurprise to find herself looking at the clear sky for the first time\nsince she had started upon this adventure by rowing into Giant's\nCave.\n\nShe floated comfortably in the water, with her head and face just\nout of it, and began to look around her. Cap'n Bill was at her side,\nand so were the two mermaids. The day was fair, and the surface of\nthe sea, which stretched far away as the eye could reach, rippled\nunder a gentle breeze. They had risen almost at the edge of a small,\nrocky islet, high in the middle, but gradually slanting down to the\nwater. No trees or bushes or grass grew anywhere about; only rocks,\ngray and bleak, were to be seen.\n\nTrot scarcely noticed this at first, however, for the island seemed\ncovered with groups of forms, some still and some moving, which the\nold sailor promptly recognized as seals. Many were lying asleep or\nsunning themselves; others crept awkwardly around, using their\nstrong fins as legs or \"paddles\" and caring little if they disturbed\nthe slumbers of the others. Once in a while one of those crowded out\nof place would give a loud and angry bark, which awakened others and\nset them to barking likewise.\n\nBaby seals were there in great numbers, and were more active and\nplayful than their elders. It was really wonderful how they could\nscramble around on the land, and Trot laughed more than once at\ntheir antics.\n\nAt the edge of the water lay many huge turtles, some as big around\nas a wagon wheel and others much smaller in size.\n\n\"The big ones are very old,\" said the Queen, seeing Trot's eyes\nfixed on the turtles.\n\n\"How old?\" asked the child.\n\n\"Hundreds of years, I think. They live to a great age, for nothing\ncan harm them when they withdraw their legs and heads into their\nthick shells. We use some of the turtles for food, but prefer the\nyounger ones. Men also fish for turtles and eat them, but of course\nno men ever come to this out-of-the-way place in the ocean, so the\ninhabitants of this little island know they are perfectly safe.\"\n\nIn the center of the island rose high cliffs on top of which were to\nbe seen great flocks of seagulls, some whirling in the air, while\nothers were perched upon the points of rock.\n\n\"What do the birds find to eat?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"They often feed upon seals which die of accident or old age, and\nthey are expert fishermen,\" explained Queen Aquareine. \"Curiously\nenough, the seals also feed upon these birds, which they are often\nable to catch in their strong jaws when the gulls venture too near.\nAnd then, the seals frequently rob the nests of eggs, of which they\nare very fond.\"\n\n\"I'd like a few gulls' eggs now,\" remarked a big seal that lay near\nthem upon the shore. Trot had thought him sound asleep, but now he\nopened his eyes to blink lazily at the group in the water.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said the Queen. \"Aren't you Chief Muffruff?\"\n\n\"I am,\" answered the old seal. \"And you are Aquareine, the mermaid\nqueen. You see, I remember you, although you haven't been here for\nyears. And isn't that Princess Clia? To be sure! But the other\nmermaids are strangers to me, especially the bald-headed one.\"\n\n\"I'm not a mermaid,\" asserted Cap'n Bill. \"I'm a sailor jes'\na-visitin' the mermaids.\"\n\n\"Our friends are earth dwellers,\" explained the Queen.\n\n\"That's odd,\" said Muffruff. \"I can't remember that any earth\ndwellers ever came this way before. I never travel far, you see, for\nI'm chief of this disorderly family of seals that live on this\nisland--on it and off it, that is.\"\n\n\"You're a poor chief,\" said a big turtle lying beside the seal. \"If\nyour people are disorderly, it is your own fault.\"\n\nMuffruff gave a chuckling laugh. Then, with a movement quick as\nlightning, he pushed his head under the shell of the turtle and gave\nit a sudden jerk. The huge turtle was tossed up on edge and then\nturned flat upon its back, where its short legs struggled vainly to\nright its overturned body.\n\n\"There!\" snorted the Seal contemptuously. \"Perhaps you'll dare\ninsult me again in the presence of visitors, you old mud-wallower!\"\n\nSeeing the plight of the turtle, several young seals came laughingly\nwabbling to the spot, and as they approached the helpless creature\ndrew in his legs and head and closed his two shells tightly\ntogether. The seals bumped against the turtle and gave it a push\nthat sent it sliding down the beach like a toboggan, and a minute\nlater it splashed into the water and sank out of sight. But that was\njust what the creature wanted. On shore the upset turtle was quite\nhelpless; but the mischievous seals saved him. For as soon as he\ntouched the water, he was able to turn and right himself, which he\npromptly did. Then he raised his head above the water and asked:\n\n\"Is it peace or war, Muffruff?\"\n\n\"Whichever you like,\" answered the Seal indifferently.\n\nPerhaps the turtle was angry, for it ran on shore with remarkable\nswiftness, uttering a shrill cry as it advanced. At once all the\nother turtles awoke to life and with upraised heads joined their\ncomrade in the rush for the seals. Most of Chief Muffruff's band\nscrambled hastily down the rocks and plunged into the water of the\nsea without waiting for the turtles to reach them; but the chief\nhimself was slow in escaping. It may be that he was ashamed to run\nwhile the mermaids were watching, but if this was so he made a great\nmistake. The turtles snapped at his fins and tail and began biting\nround chunks out of them so that Chief Muffruff screamed with pain\nand anger and floundered into the water as fast as he could go. The\nvengeful turtles were certainly the victors, and now held undisputed\npossession of the island.\n\nTrot laughed joyously at the incident, not feeling a bit sorry for\nthe old seal who had foolishly begun the battle. Even the gentle\nqueen smiled as she said:\n\n\"These quarrels between the turtles and the seals are very frequent,\nbut they are soon ended. An hour from now they will all be lying\nasleep together just as we found them; but we will not wait for\nthat. Let us go.\"\n\nShe sank slowly beneath the water again, and the others followed\nafter her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nZOG THE TERRIBLE AND HIS SEA DEVILS\n\n\n\"The sun must be going under a cloud,\" said Trot, looking ahead.\n\nThey had descended far into the ocean depths again--further, the\ngirl thought, than they had ever been before.\n\n\"No,\" the Queen answered after a glance ahead of them, \"that is a\ncuttlefish, and he is dyeing the sea around him with ink so that he\ncan hide from us. Let us turn a little to the left, for we could see\nnothing at all in that inky water.\"\n\nFollowing her advice, they made a broad curve to the left, and at\nonce the water began to darken in that direction.\n\n\"Why, there's another of 'em,\" said Cap'n Bill as the little party\ncame to a sudden halt.\n\n\"So there is,\" returned the Queen, and Trot thought there was a\nlittle quiver of anxiety in her voice. \"We must go far to the right\nto escape the ink.\"\n\nSo they again started, this time almost at a right angle to their\nformer course, the little girl inquired:\n\n\"How can the cuttlefish color the water so very black?\"\n\n\"They carry big sacks in front of them where they conceal the ink,\"\nPrincess Clia answered. \"Whenever they choose, the cuttlefish are\nable to press out this ink, and it colors the water for a great\nspace around them.\"\n\nThe direction in which they were now swimming was taking them far\nout of their way. Aquareine did not wish to travel very far to the\nright, so when she thought they had gone far enough to escape the\ninky water, she turned to lead her party toward the left--the\ndirection in which she DID wish to go. At once another cloud of ink\nstained the water and drove them to the right again.\n\n\"Is anything wrong, ma'am?\" asked Cap'n Bill, seeing a frown gather\nupon the queen's lovely face.\n\n\"I hope not,\" she said. \"But I must warn you that these cuttlefish\nare the servants of the terrible sea devils, and from the way they\nare acting they seem determined to drive us toward the Devil Caves,\nwhich I wished to avoid.\"\n\nThis admission on the part of their powerful protector, the fairy\nmermaid, sent a chill to the hearts of the earth people. Neither\nspoke for a time, but finally Cap'n Bill asked in a timid voice:\n\n\"Hadn't we better go back, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" decided Aquareine after a moment's thought. \"I think it will\nbe wise to retreat. The sea devils are evidently aware of our\nmovements and wish to annoy us. For my part, I have no fear of them,\nbut I do not care to have you meet such creatures.\"\n\nBut when they turned around to abandon their journey, another inky\ncloud was to be seen behind them. They really had no choice but to\nswim in the only streak of clear water they could find, and the\nmermaids well knew this would lead them nearer and nearer to the\ncaves of their enemies.\n\nBut Aquareine led the way, moving very slowly, and the others\nfollowed her. In every other direction they were hemmed in by the\nblack waters, and they did not dare to halt, because the inky fluid\ncrept swiftly up behind them and drove them on.\n\nThe queen and the princess had now become silent and grave. They\nswam on either side of their guests as if to better protect them.\n\n\"Don't look up,\" whispered Clia, pressing close to the little girl's\nside.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Trot, and then she did exactly what she had been\ntold not to do. She lifted her head and saw stretched over them a\nnetwork of scrawny, crimson arms interlaced like the branches of\ntrees in winter when the leaves have fallen and left them bare.\n\nCap'n Bill gave a start and muttered \"Land sakes!\" for he, too, had\ngazed upward and seen the crimson network of limbs.\n\n\"Are these the sea devils?\" asked the child, more curious than\nfrightened.\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" replied the Queen. \"But I advise you to pay no\nattention to them. Remember, they cannot touch us.\"\n\nIn order to avoid the threatening arms overhead, which followed them\nas they swam, our friends kept near to the bottom of the sea, which\nwas here thickly covered with rough and jagged rocks. The inky water\nhad now been left far behind, but when Trot looked over her\nshoulder, she shuddered to find a great crimson monster following\nclosely after them, with a dozen long, snaky feelers stretched out\nas if to grab anyone that lagged behind. And there, at the side of\nPrincess Clia, was another devil, leering silently with his cruel,\nbulging eyes at the pretty mermaid. Beside the queen swam still\nanother of their enemies. Indeed, the sea devils had crept upon them\nand surrounded them everywhere except at the front, and Trot began\nto feel nervous and worried for the first time.\n\nCap'n Bill kept mumbling queer words under his breath, for he had a\nway of talking to himself when anything \"upsot him,\" as he would\nquaintly remark. Trot always knew he was disturbed or in trouble\nwhen he began to \"growl.\"\n\nThe only way now open was straight ahead. They swam slowly, yet fast\nenough to keep a safe distance from the dreadful creature behind\nthem.\n\n\"I'm afraid they are driving us into a trap,\" whispered the Queen\nsoftly. \"But whatever happens, do not lose courage, earth friends.\nClia and I are here to protect you, and our fairy powers are\nsufficient to keep you from all harm.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind so very much,\" declared Trot calmly. \"It's like\nthe fairy adventures in storybooks, and I've often thought I'd like\nthat kind of adventures, 'cause the story always turns out the right\nway.\"\n\nCap'n Bill growled something just then, but the only words Trot\ncould make out were, \"never lived to tell the tale.\"\n\n\"Oh, pshaw, Cap'n,\" she said. \"We may be in danger, right enough,\nan' to be honest, I don't like the looks of these sea devils at all.\nBut I'm sure it's no KILLING matter, for we've got the fairy circles\nall around us.\"\n\n\"Ha ha!\" laughed the monster beside her. \"WE know all about the\nfairy circles, don't we, Migg?\"\n\n\"Ho ho!\" laughed the monster on the other side. \"We do, Slibb, my\nboy, and we don't think much of fairy circles, either!\"\n\n\"They have foiled our enemies many a time,\" declared the Princess\nwith much dignity.\n\n\"Ha ha!\" laughed one. \"That's why we're here now.\"\n\n\"Ho ho!\" laughed the other. \"We've learned a trick or two, and we've\ngot you fast this time.\"\n\nThen all the sea devils--those above and the one behind, and the two\non the sides--laughed all together, and their laughter was so\nhorrible that it made even Trot shudder.\n\nBut now the queen stopped short, and the others stopped with her.\n\n\"I will go no farther,\" she said firmly, not caring if the monsters\noverheard her. \"It is evident that these monsters are trying to\ndrive us into some secret place, and it is well known that they are\nin league with Zog the Terrible, whom they serve because they are as\nwicked as he is. We must be somewhere near the hidden castle of Zog,\nso I prefer to stay here rather than be driven into some place far\nmore dangerous. As for the sea devils, they are powerless to injure\nus in any way. Not one of those thousand arms about us can possibly\ntouch our bodies.\"\n\nThe only reply to this defiant speech was another burst of horrible\nlaughter; and now there suddenly appeared before them still another\nof the monsters, which thus completely hemmed them in. Then the\ncreatures began interlacing their long arms--or \"feelers\"--until\nthey formed a perfect cage around the prisoners, not an opening\nbeing left that was large enough for one of them to escape through.\n\nThe mermaids and the girl and sailor man kept huddled close\ntogether, for although they might be walled in by the sea devils,\ntheir captors could not touch them because of the protecting magic\ncircles.\n\nAll at once Trot exclaimed, \"Why, we must be moving!\"\n\nThis was startling news, but by watching the flow of water past them\nthey saw that the little girl was right. The sea devils were\nswimming, all together, and as the cage they were in moved forward,\nour friends were carried with it.\n\nQueen Aquareine had a stern look upon her beautiful face. Cap'n Bill\nguessed from this look that the mermaid was angry, for it seemed\nmuch like the look Trot's mother wore when they came home late to\ndinner. But however angry the queen might be, she was unable to help\nherself or her guests just now or to escape from the guidance of the\ndreaded sea devils. The rest of the party had become sober and\nthoughtful, and in dignified silence they awaited the outcome of\nthis strange adventure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nTHE ENCHANTED ISLAND\n\n\nAll at once it grew dark around them. Neither Cap'n Bill nor Trot\nliked this gloom, for it made them nervous not to be able to see\ntheir enemies.\n\n\"We must be near a sea cavern, if not within one,\" whispered\nPrincess Clia, and even as she spoke the network of scarlet arms\nparted before them, leaving an avenue for them to swim out of the\ncage. There was brighter water ahead, too, so the queen said without\nhesitation:\n\n\"Come along, dear friends; but let us clasp hands and keep close\ntogether.\"\n\nThey obeyed her commands and swam swiftly out of their prison and\ninto the clear water before them, glad to put a distance between\nthemselves and the loathesome sea devils. The monsters made no\nattempt to follow them, but they burst into a chorus of harsh\nlaughter which warned our friends that they had not yet accomplished\ntheir escape.\n\nThe four now found themselves in a broad, rocky passage, which was\ndimly lighted from some unknown source. The walls overhead, below\nthem and at the sides all glistened as if made of silver, and in\nplaces were set small statues of birds, beasts and fishes, occupying\nniches in the walls and seemingly made from the same glistening\nmaterial.\n\nThe queen swam more slowly now that the sea devils had been left\nbehind, and she looked exceedingly grave and thoughtful.\n\n\"Have you ever been here before?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"No, dear,\" said the Queen with a sigh.\n\n\"And do you know where we are?\" continued the girl.\n\n\"I can guess,\" replied Aquareine. \"There is only one place in all\nthe sea where such a passage as that we are in could exist without\nmy knowledge, and that is in the hidden dominions of Zog. If we are\nindeed in the power of that fearful magician, we must summon all our\ncourage to resist him, or we are lost!\"\n\n\"Is Zog more powerful than the mermaids?\" asked Trot anxiously.\n\n\"I do not know, for we have never before met to measure our\nstrength,\" answered Aquareine. \"But if King Anko could defeat the\nmagician, as he surely did, then I think I shall be able to do so.\"\n\n\"I wish I was sure of it,\" muttered Cap'n Bill.\n\nAbsolute silence reigned in the silver passage. No fish were there;\nnot even a sea flower grew to relieve the stern grandeur of this\nvast corridor. Trot began to be impressed with the fact that she was\na good way from her home and mother, and she wondered if she would\never get back again to the white cottage on the cliff. Here she was,\nat the bottom of the great ocean, swimming through a big tunnel that\nhad an enchanted castle at the end, and a group of horrible sea\ndevils at the other! In spite of this thought, she was not very much\nafraid. Although two fairy mermaids were her companions, she relied,\nstrange to say, more upon her tried and true friend, Cap'n Bill,\nthan upon her newer acquaintances to see her safely out of her\npresent trouble.\n\nCap'n Bill himself did not feel very confident.\n\n\"I don't care two cents what becomes o' me,\" he told Princess Clia\nin a low voice, \"but I'm drea'ful worried over our Trot. She's too\nsweet an' young to be made an end of in this 'ere fashion.\"\n\nClia smiled at this speech. \"I'm sure you will find the little\ngirl's end a good way off,\" she replied. \"Trust to our powerful\nqueen, and be sure she will find some means for us all to escape\nuninjured.\"\n\nThe light grew brighter as they advanced, until finally they\nperceived a magnificent archway just ahead of them. Aquareine\nhesitated a moment whether to go on or turn back, but there was no\nescaping the sea devils behind them, and she decided the best way\nout of their difficulties was to bravely face the unknown Zog and\nrely upon her fairy powers to prevent his doing any mischief to\nherself or her friends. So she led the way, and together they\napproached the archway and passed through it.\n\nThey now found themselves in a vast cavern, so great in extent that\nthe dome overhead looked like the sky when seen from earth. In the\ncenter of this immense sea cavern rose the towers of a splendid\ncastle, all built of coral inlaid with silver and having windows of\nclear glass.\n\nSurrounding the castle were beds of beautiful sea flowers, many\nbeing in full bloom, and these were laid out with great care in\nartistic designs. Goldfish and silverfish darted here and there\namong the foliage, and the whole scene was so pretty and peaceful\nthat Trot began to doubt there was any danger lurking in such a\nlovely place.\n\nAs they approached to look around them, a brilliantly colored\ngregfish approached and gazed at them curiously with his big,\nsaucer-like eyes. \"So Zog has got you at last!\" he said in a pitying\ntone. \"How foolish you were to swim into that part of the sea where\nhe is powerful.\"\n\n\"The sea devils made us,\" explained Clia.\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry for you, I'm sure,\" remarked the Greg, and with a\nflash of his tail, he disappeared among the sea foliage.\n\n\"Let us go to the castle,\" said the Queen in a determined voice. \"We\nmay as well boldly defy our fate as to wait until Zog seeks us out.\"\n\nSo they swam to the entrance of the castle. The doors stood wide\nopen, and the interior seemed as well lighted as the cavern itself,\nalthough none of them could discover from whence the light came.\n\nAt each side of the entrance lay a fish such as they had never seen\nbefore. It was flat as a doormat and seemed to cling fast to the\ncoral floor. Upon its back were quills like those of a porcupine,\nall pointed and sharp. From the center of the fish arose a head\nshaped like a round ball, with a circle of piercing, bead-like eyes\nset in it. These strange guardians of the entrance might be able to\ntell what their numerous eyes saw, yet they remained silent and\nwatchful. Even Aquareine gazed upon them curiously, and she gave a\nlittle shudder as she did so.\n\nInside the entrance was a domed hall with a flight of stairs leading\nto an upper balcony. Around the hall were several doorways hung with\ncurtains made of woven seaweeds. Chairs and benches stood against\nthe wall, and these astonished the visitors because neither stairs\nnor chairs seemed useful in a kingdom where every living thing was\nsupposed to swim and have a fish's tail. In Queen Aquareine's\npalaces benches for reclining were used, and stairs were wholly\nunnecessary, but in the Palace of Zog the furniture and fittings\nwere much like those of a house upon earth, and except that every\nspace here was filled with water instead of air, Trot and Cap'n Bill\nmight have imagined themselves in a handsome earthly castle.\n\nThe little group paused half fearfully in the hall, yet so far there\nwas surely nothing to be afraid of. They were wondering what to do\nnext when the curtains of an archway were pushed aside and a boy\nentered. To Trot's astonishment, he had legs and walked upon them\nnaturally and with perfect ease. He was a delicate, frail-looking\nlittle fellow, dressed in a black velvet suit with knee breeches.\nThe bows at his throat and knees were of colored seaweeds, woven\ninto broad ribbons. His hair was yellow and banged across his\nforehead. His eyes were large and dark, with a pleasant, merry\nsparkle in them. Around his neck he wore a high ruff, but in spite\nof this Trot could see that below his plump cheeks were several\nscarlet-edged slits that looked like the gills of fishes, for they\ngently opened and closed as the boy breathed in the water by which\nhe was surrounded. These gills did not greatly mar the lad's\ndelicate beauty, and he spread out his arms and bowed low and\ngracefully in greeting.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Trot.\n\n\"Why, I'd like to,\" replied the boy with a laugh, \"but being a mere\nslave, it isn't proper for me to hello. But it's good to see earth\npeople again, and I'm glad you're here.\"\n\n\"We're not glad,\" observed the girl. \"We're afraid.\"\n\n\"You'll get over that,\" declared the boy smilingly. \"People lose a\nlot of time being afraid. Once I was myself afraid, but I found it\nwas no fun, so I gave it up.\"\n\n\"Why were we brought here?\" inquired Queen Aquareine gently.\n\n\"I can't say, madam, being a mere slave,\" replied the boy. \"But you\nhave reminded me of my errand. I am sent to inform you all that Zog\nthe Forsaken, who hates all the world and is hated by all the world,\ncommands your presence in his den.\"\n\n\"Do you hate Zog, too?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Oh no,\" answered the boy. \"People lose a lot of time in hating\nothers, and there's no fun in it at all. Zog may be hateful, but I'm\nnot going to waste time hating him. You may do so, if you like.\"\n\n\"You are a queer child,\" remarked the Mermaid Queen, looking at him\nattentively. \"Will you tell us who you are?\"\n\n\"Once I was Prince Sacho of Sacharhineolaland, which is a sweet\ncountry, but hard to pronounce,\" he answered. \"But in this domain I\nhave but one title and one name, and that is 'Slave.'\"\n\n\"How came you to be Zog's slave?\" asked Clia.\n\n\"The funniest adventure you ever heard of,\" asserted the boy with\neager pride. \"I sailed in a ship that went to pieces in a storm. All\non board were drowned but me, and I came mighty near it, to tell the\ntruth. I went down deep, deep into the sea, and at the bottom was\nZog, watching the people drown. I tumbled on his head, and he\ngrabbed and saved me, saying I would make a useful slave. By his\nmagic power he made me able to live under water as the fishes live,\nand he brought me to this castle and taught me to wait upon him as\nhis other slaves do.\"\n\n\"Isn't it a dreadful, lonely life?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"No indeed,\" said Sacho. \"We haven't any time to be lonely, and the\ndreadful things Zog does are very exciting and amusing, I assure\nyou. He keeps us guessing every minute, and that makes the life here\ninteresting. Things were getting a bit slow an hour ago, but now\nthat you are here, I'm in hopes we will all be kept busy and amused\nfor some time.\"\n\n\"Are there many others in the castle besides you and Zog?\" asked\nAquareine.\n\n\"Dozens of us. Perhaps hundreds. I've never counted them,\" said the\nboy. \"But Zog is the only master; all the rest of us are in the same\nclass, so there is no jealousy among the slaves.\"\n\n\"What is Zog like?\" Cap'n Bill questioned.\n\nAt this the boy laughed, and the laugh was full of mischief. \"If I\ncould tell you what Zog is like, it would take me a year,\" was the\nreply. \"But I can't tell you. Every one has a different idea of what\nhe's like, and soon you will see him yourselves.\"\n\n\"Are you fond of him?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"If I said yes, I'd get a good whipping,\" declared Sacho. \"I am\ncommanded to hate Zog, and being a good servant, I try to obey. If\nanyone dared to like Zog, I am sure he'd be instantly fed to the\nturtles; so I advise you not to like him.\"\n\n\"Oh, we won't,\" promised Trot.\n\n\"But we're keeping the master waiting, and that is also a dangerous\nthing to do,\" continued the boy. \"If we don't hurry up, Zog will\nbegin to smile, and when he smiles there is trouble brewing.\"\n\nThe queen sighed. \"Lead the way, Sacho,\" she said. \"We will follow.\"\n\nThe boy bowed again, and going to an archway, held aside the\ncurtains for them. They first swam into a small anteroom which led\ninto a long corridor, at the end of which was another curtained\narch. Through this Sacho also guided them, and now they found\nthemselves in a cleverly constructed maze. Every few feet were\ntwists and turns and sharp corners, and sometimes the passage would\nbe wide, and again so narrow that they could just squeeze through in\nsingle file. \"Seems like we're gettin' further into the trap,\"\ngrowled Cap'n Bill. \"We couldn't find our way out o' here to save\nour lives.\"\n\n\"Oh yes we could,\" replied Clia, who was just behind him. \"Such a\nmaze may indeed puzzle you, but the queen or I could lead you safely\nthrough it again, I assure you. Zog is not so clever as he thinks\nhimself.\"\n\nThe sailor, however, found the maze very bewildering, and so did\nTrot. Passages ran in every direction, crossing and recrossing, and\nit seemed wonderful that the boy Sacho knew just which way to go.\nBut he never hesitated an instant. Trot looked carefully to see if\nthere were any marks to guide him, but every wall was of plain,\npolished marble, and every turning looked just like all the others.\nSuddenly Sacho stopped short. They were now in a broader passage,\nbut as they gathered around their conductor they found further\nadvance blocked. Solid walls faced them, and here the corridor\nseemed to end.\n\n\"Enter!\" said a clear voice.\n\n\"But we can't!\" protested Trot.\n\n\"Swim straight ahead,\" whispered the boy in soft tones. \"There is no\nreal barrier before you. Your eyes are merely deceived by magic.\"\n\n\"Ah, I understand,\" said Aquareine, nodding her pretty head. And\nthen she took Mayre's hand and swam boldly forward, while Cap'n Bill\nfollowed holding the hand of Clia. And behold! the marble wall\nmelted away before them, and they found themselves in a chamber more\nsplendid than even the fairy mermaids had ever seen before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nPRISONERS OF THE SEA MONSTER\n\n\nThe room in the enchanted castle which Zog called the \"den\" and in\nwhich the wicked sea monster passed most of his time was a perfectly\nshaped dome of solid gold. The upper part of this dome was thickly\nset with precious jewels--diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds,\nwhich sparkled beautifully through the crystal water. The lower\nwalls were as thickly studded with pearls, all being of perfect\nshape and color. Many of the pearls were larger than any which may\nbe found upon earth, for the sea people knew where to find the very\nbest and hide them away where men cannot discover them.\n\nThe golden floor was engraved with designs of rare beauty, depicting\nnot only sea life, but many adventures upon land. In the room were\nseveral large, golden cabinets, the doors of which were closed and\nlocked, and in addition to the cabinets there were tables, chairs\nand sofas, the latter upholstered with softest sealskins. Handsome\nrugs of exquisitely woven seaweeds were scattered about, the colors\nof which were artistically blended together. In one corner a\nfountain of air bubbled up through the water. The entire room was\nlighted as brilliantly as if exposed to the direct rays of the sun,\nyet where this light came from our friends could not imagine. No\nlamp or other similar device was visible anywhere.\n\nThe strangers at first scarcely glanced at all these beautiful\nthings, for in an easy chair sat Zog himself, more wonderful than\nany other living creature, and as they gazed upon him, their eyes\nseemed fascinated as if held by a spell. Zog's face was the face of\na man, except that the tops of his ears were pointed like horns and\nhe had small horns instead of eyebrows and a horn on the end of his\nchin. In spite of these deformities, the expression of the face was\nnot unpleasant or repulsive. His hair was carefully parted and\nbrushed, and his mouth and nose were not only perfect in shape but\nquite handsome.\n\nOnly the eyes betrayed Zog and made him terrible to all beholders.\nThey seemed like coals of glowing fire and sparkled so fiercely that\nno one ever cared to meet their gaze for more than an instant.\nPerhaps the monster realized this, for he usually drooped his long\nlashes over his fiery eyes to shut out their glare. Zog had two\nwell-shaped legs which ended in the hoofs of beasts instead of feet,\nand these hoofs were shod with gold. His body was a shapeless mass\ncovered with richly embroidered raiment, over which a great robe of\ncloth of gold fell in many folds. This robe was intended to hide the\nmagician's body from view, but Trot noticed that the cloth moved\nconstantly in little ripples, as if what lay underneath would not\nkeep still.\n\nThe best features of which Zog could boast were his arms and hands,\nthe latter being as well formed, as delicate and white as those of a\nwell-bred woman. When he spoke, his voice sounded sweet and clear,\nand its tones were very gentle. He had given them a few moments to\nstare at him, for he was examining them in turn with considerable\ncuriosity. \"Well,\" said he, \"do you not find me the most hateful\ncreature you have ever beheld?\"\n\nThe queen refrained from answering, but Trot said promptly, \"We do.\nNothing could be more horrider or more disgustin' than you are, it\nseems to me.\"\n\n\"Very good, very good indeed,\" declared the monster, lifting his\nlashes to flash his glowing eyes upon them. Then he turned toward\nCap'n Bill. \"Man-fish,\" he continued, \"what do YOU think of me?\"\n\n\"Mighty little,\" the sailor replied. \"You orter be 'shamed to ask\nsech a question, knowin' you look worse ner the devil himself.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" answered Zog, frowning. He felt that he had received a\nhigh compliment, and the frown showed he was pleased with Cap'n\nBill.\n\nBut now Queen Aquareine advanced to a position in front of their\ncaptor and said, \"Tell me, Zog, why have you trapped us and brought\nus here?\"\n\n\"To destroy you,\" was the quick answer, and the magician turned for\nan instant to flash his eyes upon the beautiful mermaid. \"For two\nhundred years I have been awaiting a chance to get within my power\nsome friend of Anko the Sea Serpent--of Anko, whom I hate!\" he\nadded, smiling sweetly. \"When you left your palace today, my swift\nspies warned me, and so I sent the sea devils to capture you. Often\nhave they tried to do this before, but always failed. Today, acting\nby my command, they tricked you, and by surrounding you forced you\nto the entrance of my enchanted castle. The result is a fine capture\nof important personages. I have now in my power the queen and\nprincess of the fairy mermaids, as well as two wandering earth\npeople, and I assure you I shall take great pleasure in destroying\nyou utterly.\"\n\n\"You are a coward,\" declared the Queen proudly. \"You dared not meet\nus in the open sea.\"\n\n\"No, I dare not leave this castle,\" Zog admitted, still smiling.\n\"But here in my own domain my power is supreme. Nothing can\ninterfere with my vengeance.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Aquareine, firmly meeting the gaze\nof the terrible eyes.\n\n\"Of course,\" he answered, nodding his head with a graceful movement.\n\"You will try to thwart me and escape. You will pit your fairy power\nagainst my powers of magic. That will give me great pleasure, for\nthe more you struggle, the greater will be my revenge.\"\n\n\"But why should you seek revenge upon us?\" asked Clia. \"We have\nnever harmed you.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied Zog. \"I bear you no personal ill will. But\nyou are friends of my great enemy, King Anko, and it will annoy him\nvery much when he finds that you have been destroyed by me. I cannot\nhurt the rascally old sea serpent himself, but through you I can\nmake him feel my vengeance.\"\n\n\"The mermaids have existed thousands of years,\" said the Queen in a\ntone of pride. \"Do you imagine the despised and conquered Zog has\npower to destroy them?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" was the quiet answer. \"It will be interesting to\ndiscover which is the more powerful.\"\n\n\"I challenge you to begin the test at once, vile magician!\"\nexclaimed Aquareine.\n\n\"There is no hurry, fair Queen,\" answered Zog in his softest tones.\n\"I have been so many years in accomplishing your capture that it is\nfoolish to act hastily now. Besides, I am lonely. Here in my forced\nretirement I see only those uninteresting earth mortals whom I have\nmade my slaves, for all sea dwellers are forbidden to serve me save\nthe sea devils, and they dare not enter my castle. I have saved many\nmortals from drowning and brought them here to people my castle, but\nI do not love mortals. Two lovely mermaids are much more\ninteresting, and before I allow you to perish, I shall have much\namusement in witnessing your despair and your struggles to escape.\nYou are now my prisoners. By slow degrees I shall wear out your\nfairy powers and break your hearts, as well as the hearts of these\nearth dwellers who have no magic powers, and I think it will be a\nlong time before I finally permit you to die.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Trot cheerfully. \"The longer you take, the\nbetter I'll be satisfied.\"\n\n\"That's how I feel about it,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"Don't get in a\nhurry to kill us Zog. It'll be such a wear an' tear on your nerves.\nJes' take it easy an' let us live as long as we can.\"\n\n\"Don't you care to die?\" asked the magician.\n\n\"It's a thing I never longed for,\" the sailor replied. \"You see, we\nhad no business to go on a trip with the mermaids to begin with.\nI've allus heard tell that mermaids is dangerous, an' no one as met\n'em ever lived to tell the tale. Eh, Trot?\"\n\n\"That's what you said, Cap'n Bill.\"\n\n\"So I guess we're done for, one way 'r 'nother, an' it don't matter\nmuch which. But Trot's a good child, an' mighty young an' tender. It\ndon't seem like her time has come to die. I'd like to have her sent\nsafe home to her mother. So I've got this 'ere proposition to make,\nZog. If your magic could make ME die twice, or even THREE times fer\ngood measure, why you go ahead an' do it an' I won't complain. All I\nask is fer you to send this little girl safe back to dry land\nagain.\"\n\n\"Don't you do it, Zog!\" cried Trot indignantly, and turning to Cap'n\nBill, she added, \"I'm not goin' to leave you down here in all this\nmess, Cap'n, and don't you think it. If one of us gets out of the\nmuddle we're in, we'll both get out, so don't you make any bargains\nwith Zog to die twice.\"\n\nZog listened to this conversation very carefully. \"The dying does\nnot amount to much,\" he said. \"It is the thinking about it that\nhurts you mortals most. I've watched many a shipwreck at sea, and\nthe people would howl and scream for hours before the ship broke up.\nTheir terror was very enjoyable. But when the end came, they all\ndrowned as peacefully as if they were going to sleep, so it didn't\namuse me at all.\"\n\n\"I'm not worrying,\" said Trot.\n\n\"Ner me,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"You'll find we can take what comes jes'\nas easy as anybody.\"\n\n\"I do not expect to get much from you poor mortals,\" said Zog\ncarelessly. \"You are merely a side show to my circus, a sort of\ndessert to my feast of vengeance. When the time comes, I can find a\nhundred ways to kill you. My most interesting prisoners are these\npretty mermaids, who claim that none of their race has ever yet died\nor been destroyed. The first mermaid ever created is living yet, and\nI am told she is none other than Queen Aquareine. So I have a pretty\nproblem before me to invent some way to destroy the mermaids or put\nthem out of existence. And it will require some thought.\"\n\n\"Also, it will require some power you do not possess,\" suggested the\nQueen.\n\n\"That may be,\" replied Zog softly. \"But I am going to experiment,\nand I believe I shall be able to cause you a lot of pain and sorrow\nbefore I finally make an end of you. I have not lived twenty-seven\nthousand years, Aquareine, without getting a certain amount of\nwisdom, and I am more powerful than you suspect.\"\n\n\"You are a monster and a wicked magician,\" said the Mermaid Queen.\n\n\"I am,\" agreed Zog, \"but I cannot help it. I was created part man,\npart bird, part fish, part beast and part reptile, and such a\nmonstrosity could not be otherwise than wicked. Everybody hates me,\nand I hate everybody.\"\n\n\"Why don't you kill yourself?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"I've tried that and failed,\" he answered. \"Only one being in the\nworld has power to destroy me, and that is King Anko, the sea\nserpent.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better let him do it,\" advised the little girl.\n\n\"No. Much as I long to die, I cannot allow King Anko the pleasure of\nkilling me. He has always been my worst enemy, and it would be such\na joy to him to kill me that I really cannot allow him. Indeed, I\nhave always hoped to kill Anko. I have now been three thousand six\nhundred and forty-two years, eleven months and nine days figuring\nout a plan to destroy old Anko, and as yet I have not discovered a\nway.\"\n\n\"I'd give it up, if I were you,\" advised Trot. \"Don't you think you\ncould get some fun out of trying to be good?\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Zog, and his voice was not so soft as before. \"Listen,\nAquareine, you and your attendants shall be prisoners in this castle\nuntil I can manage to stop you from living. Rooms will be placed at\nyour disposal, and I wish you to go to them at o nce, as I am tired\nof looking at you.\"\n\n\"You're no more tired than we are,\" remarked Trot. \"It's lucky you\ncan't see yourself, Zog.\"\n\nHe turned his glowing eyes full upon her. \"The worst of my queer\nbody I keep concealed,\" he said. \"If ever you see it, you will\nscream with terror.\" He touched a bell beside him, and the girl was\nsurprised to find how clearly its tones rang out through the water.\nIn an instant the boy Sacho appeared and bowed low before his\ndreadful master. \"Take the mermaids and the child to the Rose\nChamber,\" commanded Zog, \"and take the old man-fish to the Peony\nRoom.\"\n\nSacho turned to obey. \"Are the outer passages well guarded?\" asked\nthe monster.\n\n\"Yes, as you have commanded,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Then you may allow the prisoners to roam at will throughout the\ncastle. Now, go!\"\n\nThe prisoners followed Sacho from the room, glad to get away. The\npresence of this evil being had grown oppressive to them, and Zog\nhad himself seemed ill at ease during the last few minutes. The robe\nso closely wound around his body moved jerkily, as if something\nbeneath disturbed it, and at such times Zog shifted nervously in his\nseat.\n\nSacho's thin little legs trotted through the water and led the way\ninto a different passage from the one by which they had entered.\nThey swam slowly after him and breathed easier when they had left\nthe golden domed chamber where their wicked enemy sat enthroned.\n\"Well, how do you like him?\" asked Sacho with a laugh.\n\n\"We hate him!\" declared Trot emphatically.\n\n\"Of course you do,\" replied Sacho. \"But you're wasting time hating\nanything. It doesn't do you any good, or him any harm. Can you\nsing?\"\n\n\"A little,\" said Trot, \"but I don't feel like singing now.\"\n\n\"You're wrong about that,\" the boy asserted. \"Anything that keeps\nyou from singing is foolishness, unless it's laughter. Laughter, joy\nand song are the only good things in the world.\"\n\nTrot did not answer this queer speech, for just then they came to a\nflight of stairs, and Sacho climbed up them while the others swam.\nAnd now they were in a lofty, broad corridor having many doors hung\nwith seaweed draperies. At one of these doorways Sacho stopped and\nsaid, \"Here is the Rose Chamber where the master commands you to\nlive until you die. You may wander anywhere in the castle as you\nplease; to leave it is impossible. Whenever you return to the Rose\nChamber, you will know it by this design of roses sewn in pearls\nupon the hangings. The Peony Room where the man-fish is to live is\nthe next one farther on.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied Queen Aquareine. \"Are we to be fed?\"\n\n\"Meals will be served in your rooms. If you desire anything, ring\nthe bell and some of the slaves will be sure to answer it. I am\nmostly in attendance upon my master, but whenever I am at liberty I\nwill look after your comfort myself.\"\n\nAgain they thanked the strange boy, and he turned and left them.\nThey could hear him whistle and sing as he returned along the\npassage. Then Princess Clia parted the curtains that her queen and\ncompanions might enter the Rose Chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nCAP'N JOE AND CAP'N BILL\n\n\nThe rooms Zog had given his prisoners were as handsome as all other\nparts of this strange enchanted castle. Gold was used plentifully in\nthe decorations, and in the Rose Chamber occupied by the mermaids\nand Trot golden roses formed a border around the entire room. The\nsea maidens had evidently been expected, for the magician had\nprovided couches for them to recline upon similar to the ones used\nin the mermaid palaces. The frames were of mother of pearl and the\ncushions of soft, white sponges. In the room were toilet tables,\nmirrors, ornaments and many articles used by earth people, which\nthey afterward learned had been plundered by Zog from sunken ships\nand brought to his castle by his allies, the sea devils.\n\nWhile the mermaids were examining and admiring their room, Cap'n\nBill went to the Peony Room to see what it was like and found his\nquarters were very cozy and interesting. There were pictures on the\nwall, portraits of grave-looking porpoises, bashful seals, and smug\nand smiling walruses. Some of the wall panels were formed of mirrors\nand reflected clearly the interior of the room. Around the ceiling\nwas a frieze of imitation peonies in silver, and the furniture was\npeony-shaped, the broad leaves being bent to form seats and couches.\nBeside a pretty dressing table hung a bell cord with a tassel at the\nend. Cap'n Bill did not know it was a bell cord, so he pulled it to\nsee what would happen and was puzzled to find that nothing seemed to\nhappen at all, the bell being too far away for him to hear it. Then\nhe began looking at the treasures contained in this royal apartment,\nand was much pleased with a golden statue of a mermaid that\nresembled Princess Clia in feature. A silver flower vase upon a\nstand contained a bouquet of gorgeous peonies, \"as nat'ral as life,\"\nsaid Cap'n Bill, although he saw plainly that they must be made of\nmetal.\n\nTrot came in just then to see how her dear friend was located. She\nentered from the doorway that connected the two rooms and said,\n\"Isn't it pretty, Cap'n? And who'd ever think that awful creature\nZog owned such a splendid castle and kept his prisoners in such\nlovely rooms?\"\n\n\"I once heard tell,\" said the sailor, \"of a foreign people that\nsacrificed humans to please their pagan gods, an' before they killed\n'em outright they stuffed the victims full of good things to eat an'\ndressed 'em in pretty clothes an' treated 'em like princes. That's\nwhy I don't take much comfort in our fine surroundin's, Trot. This\nZog is a pagan, if ever there was one, an' he don't mean us any\ngood, you may depend on 't.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Trot soberly, \"I'm sure he does not expect us to be\nhappy here. But I'm going to fool him and have just as good a time\nas I can.\" As she spoke they both turned around--an easy thing to do\nwith a single flop of their flexible tails--and Cap'n Bill uttered a\ncry of surprise. Just across the room stood a perfect duplicate of\nhimself. The round head, with its bald top and scraggly whiskers,\nthe sailor cap and shirt, the wide pantaloons, even the wooden leg,\neach and every one were exact copies of those owned by Cap'n Bill.\nEven the expression in the light-blue eyes was the same, and it is\nno wonder the old sailor stared at his \"double\" in amazement. But\nthe next minute he laughed and said, \"Why, Trot, it's ME reflected\nin a mirror. But at first I thought it was someone else.\"\n\nTrot was staring, too. \"Look, Cap'n!\" she whispered. \"Look at the\nwooden leg.\"\n\n\"Well, it's MY wooden leg, ain't it?\" he inquired.\n\n\"If it is, it can't be a reflection in a mirror,\" she argued, \"for\nYOU haven't got a wooden leg. You've got a fish's tail.\"\n\nThe old sailor was so startled by this truth that he gave a great\nflop with his tail that upset his balance and made him keel a\nsomersault in the water before he got right side up again. Then he\nfound the other sailor man laughing at him and was horrified to find\nthe \"reflection\" advancing toward them by stumping along on its\nwooden leg. \"Keep away! Get out, there!\" yelled Cap'n Bill. \"You're\na ghost, the ghost o' me that once was, an' I can't bear the sight\no' you. Git out!\"\n\n\"Did you ring jes' to tell me to git out?\" asked the other in a mild\nvoice.\n\n\"I--I didn't ring,\" declared Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"You did. You pulled that bell cord,\" said the one-legged (one or\nmore lines missing here in this edition)\n\n\"Oh, did pullin' that thing ring a bell?\" inquired the Cap'n, a\nlittle ashamed of his ignorance and reassured by hearing the \"ghost\"\ntalk.\n\n\"It surely did,\" was the reply, \"and Sacho told me to answer your\nbell and look after you. So I'm a-lookin' after you.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't,\" protested Cap'n Bill. \"I've no use fer--fer\nghostses, anyhow.\"\n\nThe strange sailor began to chuckle at hearing this, and his chuckle\nwas just like Cap'n Bill's chuckle, so full of merry humor that it\nusually made everyone laugh with him.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Trot, who was very curious and much surprised.\n\n\"I'm Cap'n Joe,\" was the reply. \"Cap'n Joe Weedles, formerly o' the\nbrig 'Gladsome' an' now a slave o' Zog at the bottom o' the sea.\"\n\n\"J--J--Joe Wee-Weedles!\" gasped Cap'n Bill, amazed. \"Joe Weedles o'\nthe 'Gladsome'! Why, dash my eyes, mate, you must be my brother!\"\n\n\"Are YOU Bill Weedles?\" asked the other. And then he added, \"But no,\nyou can't be. Bill wasn't no mermaid. He were a human critter like\nmyself.\"\n\n\"That's what I am,\" said Cap'n Bill hastily. \"I'm a human critter,\ntoo. I've jes' borrered this fish tail to swim with while I'm\nvisitin' the mermaids.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Cap'n Joe in astonishment. \"Who'd o' thought it!\nAn' who'd ever o' thought as I'd find my long-lost brother in Zog's\nenchanted castle full fifty fathoms deep down in the wet, wet\nwater!\"\n\n\"Why, as fer that,\" replied Cap'n Bill, \"it's YOU as is the\nlong-lost brother, not me. You an' your ship disappeared many a year\nago, an' ain't never been heard of since, while, as you see, I'm\nlivin' on earth yet.\"\n\n\"You don't look it to all appearances,\" remarked Cap'n Joe in a\nreflective tone of voice. \"But I'll agree it's many a year since I\nsaw the top o' the water, an' I'm not expectin' to ever tramp on dry\nland again.\"\n\n\"Are you dead, or drownded, or what?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Neither one nor t'other,\" was the answer. \"But Zog gave me gills\nso's I could live in the water like fishes do, an' if I got on land\nI couldn't breathe air any more'n a fish out o' water can. So I\nguess as long as I live, I'll hev to stay down here.\"\n\n\"Do you like it?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Oh, I don't objec' much,\" said Cap'n Joe. \"There ain't much\nexcitement here, fer we don't catch a flock o' mermaids ev'ry day,\nbut the work is easy an' the rations fair. I might o' been worse\noff, you know, for when my brig was wrecked, I'd 'a' gone to Davy\nJones's Locker if Zog hadn't happened to find me an' made me a\nfish.\"\n\n\"You don't look as much like a fish as Cap'n Bill does,\" observed\nTrot.\n\n\"P'raps not,\" said Cap'n Joe, \"but I notice Bill ain't got any gills\nan' breathes like you an' the mermaids does. When he gets back to\nland, he'll have his two legs again an' live in comfort breathin'\nair.\"\n\n\"I won't have two legs,\" asserted Cap'n Bill, \"for when I'm on earth\nI'm fitted with one wooden leg, jes' the same as you are, Joe.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hadn't heard o' that, Bill, but I'm not surprised,\" replied\nBrother Joe. \"Many a sailor gets to wear a wooden leg in time.\nMine's hick'ry.\"\n\n\"So's mine,\" said Cap'n Bill with a air of pride. \"I'm glad I've run\nacross you, Joe, for I often wondered what had become of you. Seems\ntoo bad, though, to have to spend all your life under water.\"\n\n\"What's the odds?\" asked Cap'n Joe. \"I never could keep away from\nthe water since I was a boy, an' there's more dangers to be met\nfloatin' on it than there is soakin' in it. An' one other thing\npleases me when I think on it: I'm parted from my wife, a mighty\ngood woman with a tongue like a two-edge sword, an' my pore\nwidder'll get the insurance money an' live happy. As fer me, Bill,\nI'm a good deal happier than I was when she kep' scoldin' me from\nmornin' to night every minute I was home.\"\n\n\"Is Zog a kind master?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"I can't say he's kind,\" replied Cap'n Joe, \"for he's as near a\ndevil as any livin' critter CAN be. He grumbles an' growls in his\nsoft voice all day, an' hates himself an' everybody else. But I\ndon't see much of him. There's so many of us slaves here that Zog\ndon't pay much attention to us, an' we have a pretty good time when\nthe ol' magician is shut up in his den, as he mostly is.\"\n\n\"Could you help us to escape?\" asked the child.\n\n\"Why, I don't know how,\" admitted Cap'n Joe. \"There's magic all\naround us, and we slaves are never allowed to leave this great cave.\nI'll do what I can, o' course, but Sacho is the boy to help you if\nanyone can. That little chap knows a heap, I can tell you. So now,\nif nothin' more's wanted, I must get back to work.\"\n\n\"What work do you do?\" Cap'n Bill asked.\n\n\"I sew buttons on Zog's clothes. Every time he gets mad, he busts\nhis buttons off, an' I have to sew 'em on again. As he's mad most o'\nthe time, it keeps me busy.\"\n\n\"I'll see you again, won't I, Joe?\" said Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"No reason why you shouldn't, if you manage to keep alive,\" said\nCap'n Joe. \"But you mustn't forget, Bill, this Zog has his grip on\nyou, an' I've never known anything to escape him yet.\"\n\nSaying this, the old sailor began to stump toward the door, but\ntripped his foot against his wooden leg and gave a swift dive\nforward. He would have fallen flat had he not grabbed the drapery at\nthe doorway and saved himself by holding fast to it with both hands.\nEven then he rolled and twisted so awkwardly before he could get\nupon his legs that Trot had to laugh outright at his antics. \"This\nhick'ry leg,\" said Cap'n Joe, \"is so blamed light that it always\nwants to float. Agga-Groo, the goldworker, has promised me a gold\nleg that will stay down, but he never has time to make it. You're\nmighty lucky, Bill, to have a merman's tail instead o' legs.\"\n\n\"I guess I am, Joe,\" replied Cap'n Bill, \"for in such a wet country\nthe fishes have the best of it. But I ain't sure I'd like this sort\no' thing always.\"\n\n\"Think o' the money you'd make in a side show,\" said Cap'n Joe with\nhis funny chuckling laugh. Then he pounded his wooden leg against\nthe hard floor and managed to hobble from the room without more\naccidents.\n\nWhen he had gone, Trot said, \"Aren't you glad to find your brother\nagain, Cap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"Why, so-so,\" replied the sailor. \"I don't know much about Joe,\nseein' as we haven't met before for many a long year, an' all I\nremember about our boyhood days is that we fit an' pulled hair most\no' the time. But what worries me most is Joe's lookin' so much like\nme myself, wooden leg an' all. Don't you think it's rather cheeky\nan' unbrotherly, Trot?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he can't help it,\" suggested the child. \"And anyhow, he'll\nnever be able to live on land again.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cap'n Bill with a sigh. \"Joe's a fish, now, an' so he\nain't likely to be took for me by one of our friends on the earth.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nTHE MAGIC OF THE MERMAIDS\n\n\nWhen Trot and Cap'n Bill entered the Rose Chamber they found the two\nmermaids reclining before an air fountain that was sending thousands\nof tiny bubbles up through the water.\n\n\"These fountains of air are excellent things,\" remarked Queen\nAquareine, \"for they keep the water fresh and sweet, and that is the\nmore necessary when it is confined by walls, as it is in this\ncastle. But now, let us counsel together and decide what to do in\nthe emergency that confronts us.\"\n\n\"How can we tell what to do without knowing what's going to happen?\"\nasked Trot.\n\n\"Somethin's sure to happen,\" said Cap'n Bill.\n\nAs if to prove his words, a gong suddenly sounded at their door and\nin walked a fat little man clothed all in white, including a white\napron and white cap. His face was round and jolly, and he had a big\nmustache that curled up at the ends.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said the little man, spreading out his legs and\nputting his hands on his hips as he stood looking at them. \"Of all\nthe queer things in the sea, you're the queerest! Mermaids, eh?\"\n\n\"Don't bunch us that way!\" protested Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"You are quite wrong,\" said Trot. \"I'm a--a girl.\"\n\n\"With a fish's tail?\" he asked, laughing at her.\n\n\"That's only just for a while,\" she said, \"while I'm in the water,\nyou know. When I'm at home on the land I walk just as you do, an' so\ndoes Cap'n Bill.\"\n\n\"But we haven't any gills,\" remarked the Cap'n, looking closely at\nthe little man's throat, \"so I take it we're not as fishy as some\nothers.\"\n\n\"If you mean me, I must admit you are right,\" said the little man,\ntwisting his mustache. \"I'm as near a fish as a man can be. But you\nsee, Cap'n, without the gills that make me a fish, I could not live\nunder water.\"\n\n\"When it comes to that, you've no business to live under water,\"\nasserted the sailor. \"But I s'pose you're a slave and can't help\nit.\"\n\n\"I'm chief cook for that old horror Zog. And that reminds me, good\nmermaids, or good people, or good girls and sailors, or whatever you\nare, that I'm sent here to ask what you'd like to eat.\"\n\n\"Good to see you, sir,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I'm nearly starved,\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I had it in mind,\" said the little man, \"to prepare a regular\nmermaid dinner, but since you're not mermaids--\"\n\n\"Oh, two of us are,\" said the Queen, smiling. \"I, my good cook, am\nAquareine, the ruler of the mermaids, and this is the Princess\nClia.\"\n\n\"I've often heard of you, your Majesty,\" returned the chief cook,\nbowing respectfully, \"and I must say I've heard only good of you.\nNow that you have unfortunately become my master's prisoners, it\nwill give me pleasure to serve you as well as I am able.\"\n\n\"We thank you, good sir,\" said Aquareine.\n\n\"What have you got to eat?\" inquired Trot. \"Seems to me I'm hollow\nway down to my toes--my tail, I mean--and it'll take a lot to fill\nme up. We haven't eaten a morsel since breakfast, you know.\"\n\n\"I think I shall be able to give you almost anything you would\nlike,\" said the cook. \"Zog is a wonderful magician and can procure\nanything that exists with no more effort than a wiggle of his thumb.\nBut some eatables, you know, are hard to serve under water, because\nthey get so damp that they are soon ruined.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is different with the mermaids,\" said Princess Clia.\n\n\"Yes, all your things are kept dry because they are surrounded by\nair. I've heard how the mermaids live. But here it is different.\"\n\n\"Take this ring,\" said the Queen, handing the chief cook a circlet\nwhich she drew from her finger. \"While it is in your possession, the\nfood you prepare will not get wet, or even moist.\"\n\n\"I thank your Majesty,\" returned the cook, taking the ring. \"My name\nis Tom Atto, and I'll do my best to please you. How would you like\nfor luncheon some oysters on the half-shell, clam broth, shrimp\nsalad, broiled turtle steak and watermelon?\"\n\n\"That will do very nicely,\" answered the Queen.\n\n\"Do watermelons grow in the sea?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Of course, that is why they are called watermelons,\" replied Tom\nAtto. \"I think I shall serve you a water ice, in addition to the\nrest. Water ice is an appropriate sea food.\"\n\n\"Have some watercress with the salad,\" said Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"I'd thought of that,\" declared the cook. \"Doesn't my bill of fare\nmake your mouths water?\"\n\n\"Hurry up and get it ready,\" suggested Trot.\n\nTom Atto at once bowed and retired, and when they were done, Cap'n\nBill said to the queen, \"Do you think, ma'am, we can manage to\nescape from Zog and his castle?\"\n\n\"I hope we shall find a way,\" replied Aquareine. \"The evil powers of\nmagic which Zog controls may not prove to be as strong as the fairy\npowers I possess, but of course I cannot be positive until I\ndiscover what this wicked magician is able to do.\"\n\nPrincess Clia was looking out of one of the windows. \"I think I can\nsee an opening far up in the top of the dome,\" she said. They all\nhastened to the windows to look, and although Trot and Cap'n Bill\ncould see nothing but a solid dome above the castle--perhaps because\nit was so far away from them--the sharp eyes of Aquareine were not\nto be deceived.\n\n\"Yes,\" she announced, \"there is surely an opening in the center of\nthe great dome. A little thought must convince us that such an\nopening is bound to exist, for otherwise the water confined within\nthe dome would not be fresh or clear.\"\n\n\"Then if we could escape from this castle, we could swim up to the\nhole in the dome and get free!\" exclaimed Trot.\n\n\"Why, Zog has probably ordered the opening well guarded, as he has\nall the other outlets,\" responded the Queen. \"Yet it may be worth\nwhile for us to make the attempt to get back into the broad ocean\nthis way. The night would be the best time, when all are asleep, and\nsurely it will be quicker to reach the ocean through this hole in\nthe roof than by means of the long, winding passages by which we\nentered.\"\n\n\"But we will have to break out of the castle in some way,\" observed\nCap'n Bill.\n\n\"That will not be difficult,\" answered Aquareine. \"It will be no\ntrouble for me to shatter one of these panes of glass, allowing us\nto pass out and swim straight up to the top of the dome.\"\n\n\"Let's do it now!\" said Trot eagerly.\n\n\"No, my dear, we must wait for a good opportunity when we are not\nwatched closely. We do not wish the terrible Zog to thwart our\nplan,\" answered the Queen gently.\n\nPresently two sailor boys entered bearing trays of food, which they\nplaced upon a large table. They were cheery-faced young fellows with\ngills at their throats, but had laughing eyes, and Trot was\nastonished not to find any of the slaves of Zog weeping or\nmiserable. Instead, they were as jolly and good-natured as could be\nand seemed to like their life under the water. Cap'n Bill asked one\nof the boys how many slaves were in the castle, and the youth\nreplied that he would try to count them and let him know.\n\nTom Atto had, they found, prepared for them an excellent meal, and\nthey ate heartily because they were really hungry. After luncheon\nCap'n Bill smoked his pipe contentedly, and they renewed their\nconversation, planning various ways to outwit Zog and make their\nescape. While thus engaged, the gong at the door sounded and Sacho\nentered.\n\n\"My diabolical master commands you to attend him,\" said the boy.\n\n\"When?\" asked Aquareine.\n\n\"At once, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Very well, we will follow you,\" she said. So they swam down the\ncorridors following Sacho until they again reached the golden-domed\nroom they had formerly visited. Here sat Zog just as they had left\nhim, seemingly, but when his prisoners entered, the magician arose\nand stood upon his cloven feet and then silently walked to a\ncurtained archway.\n\nSacho commanded the prisoners to follow, and beyond the archway they\nfound a vast chamber that occupied the center of the castle and was\nas big as a ballroom. Zog, who seemed to walk with much difficulty\nbecause his ungainly body swayed back and forth, did not go far\nbeyond the arched entrance. A golden throne was set nearby, and in\nthis the monster seated himself. At one side of the throne stood a\ngroup of slaves. They were men, women and children. All had broad\ngold bands clasped around their ankles as a badge of servitude, and\nat each throat were the fish's gills that enabled them to breathe\nand live under water. Yet every face was smiling and serene, even in\nthe presence of their dread master. In parts of the big hall were\ngroups of other slaves.\n\nSacho ranged the prisoners in a circle before Zog's throne, and\nslowly the magician turned his eyes, glowing like live coals, upon\nthe four. \"Captives,\" said he, speaking in his clear, sweet voice,\n\"in our first interview you defied me, and both the mermaid queen\nand the princess declared they could not die. But if that is a true\nstatement, as I have yet to discover, there are various ways to make\nyou miserable and unhappy, and this I propose to do in order to\namuse myself at your expense. You have been brought here to undergo\nthe first trial of strength between us.\" None of the prisoners\nreplied to this speech, so Zog turned to one of his slaves and said,\n\"Rivivi, bring in the Yell-Maker.\"\n\nRivivi was a big fellow, brown of skin and with flashing, black\neyes. He bowed to his master and left the room by an archway covered\nwith heavy draperies. The next moment these curtains were violently\npushed aside, and a dreadful sea creature swam into the hall. It had\na body much like that of a crab, only more round and of a jet-black\ncolor. Its eyes were bright yellow balls set on the ends of two\nhorns that stuck out of its head. They were cruel-looking eyes, too,\nand seemed able to see every person in the room at the same time.\nThe legs of the Yell-Maker, however, were the most curious part of\nthe creature. There were six of them, slender and black as coal, and\neach extended twelve to fifteen feet from its body when stretched\nout in a straight line. They were hinged in several places so they\ncould be folded up or extended at will. At the ends of these thin\nlegs were immense claws shaped like those of a lobster, and they\nwere real \"nippers\" of a most dangerous sort.\n\nThe prisoners knew, as soon as they saw the awful claws, why the\nthing was called the \"Yell-Maker,\" and Trot gave a little shiver and\ncrept closer to Cap'n Bill. Zog looked with approval upon the\ncreature he had summoned and said to it, \"I give you four victims,\nthe four people with fish's tails. Let me hear how loud they can\nyell.\"\n\nThe Yell-Maker uttered a grunt of pleasure and in a flash stretched\nout one of its long legs toward the queen's nose, where its powerful\nclaws came together with a loud noise. Aquareine did not stir; she\nonly smiled. Both Zog and the creature that had attacked her seemed\nmuch surprised to find she was unhurt. \"Again!\" cried Zog, and again\nthe Yell-Maker's claw shot out and tried to pinch the queen's pretty\near. But the magic of the fairy mermaid was proof against this\nsea-rascal's strength and swiftness, nor could he touch any part of\nAquareine, although he tried again and again, roaring with anger\nlike a mad bull.\n\nTrot began to enjoy this performance, and as her merry, childish\nlaughter rang out, the Yell-Maker turned furiously upon the little\ngirl, two of the dreadful claws trying to nip her at the same time.\nShe had no chance to cry out or jump backward, yet she remained\nunharmed. For the Fairy Circle of Queen Aquareine kept her safe. Now\nCap'n Bill was attacked, and Princess Clia as well. The half-dozen\nslender legs darted in every direction like sword thrusts to reach\ntheir victims, and the cruel claws snapped so rapidly that the sound\nwas like the rattling of castanets. But the four prisoners regarded\ntheir enemy with smiling composure, and no yell greeted the\nYell-Maker's efforts.\n\n\"Enough!\" said Zog, softly and sweetly. \"You may retire, my poor\nYell-Maker, for with these people you are powerless.\"\n\nThe creature paused and rolled its yellow eyes. \"May I nip just one\nof the slaves, oh Zog?\" it asked pleadingly. \"I hate to leave\nwithout pleasing your ears with a single yell.\"\n\n\"Let my slaves alone,\" was Zog's answer. \"They are here to serve me\nand must not be injured. Go, feeble one.\"\n\n\"Not so!\" cried the Queen. \"It is a shame, Zog, that such an evil\nthing should exist in our fair sea.\" With this, she drew her fairy\nwand from a fold of her gown and waved it toward the creature. At\nonce the Yell-Maker sank down unconscious upon the floor; its legs\nfell apart in many pieces, the claws tumbling in a heap beside the\nbody. Then all grew withered and lost shape, becoming a pulpy mass,\nlike gelatin. A few moments later the creature had melted away to\nnothing at all, forever disappearing from the ocean where it had\ncaused so much horror and pain.\n\nZog watched this destruction with surprising patience. When it was\nall over, he nodded his head and smiled, and Trot noticed that\nwhenever Zog smiled, his slaves lost their jolly looks and began to\ntremble. \"That is very pretty magic, Aquareine,\" said the monster.\n\"I myself learned the trick several thousand years ago, so it does\nnot astonish me. Have you fairies nothing that is new to show me?\"\n\n\"We desire only to protect ourselves,\" replied the Queen with\ndignity.\n\n\"Then I will give you a chance to do so,\" said Zog. As he spoke, the\ngreat marble blocks in the ceiling of the room directly over the\nheads of the captives gave way and came crashing down upon them.\nMany tons of weight were in these marble blocks, and the magician\nhad planned to crush his victims where they stood. But the four were\nstill unharmed. The marble, being unable to touch them, was diverted\nfrom its course, and when the roar of the great crash had died away,\nZog saw his intended victims standing quietly in their places and\nsmiling scornfully at his weak attempts to destroy them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nTHE TOP OF THE GREAT DOME\n\n\nCap'n Bill's heart was beating pretty vast, but he did not let Zog\nknow that. Trot was so sure of the protection of the fairy mermaids\nthat she would not allow herself to become frightened. Aquareine and\nClia were as calm as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Please excuse this little interruption,\" said Zog. \"I knew very\nwell the marble blocks would not hurt you. But the play is over for\na time. You may now retire to your rooms, and when I again invite\nyou to my presence, I shall have found some better ways to entertain\nyou.\"\n\nWithout reply to this threat, they turned and followed Sacho from\nthe hall, and the boy led them straight back to their own rooms.\n\n\"Zog is making a great mistake,\" said Sacho with a laugh. \"He has no\ntime for vengeance, but the great magician does not know that.\"\n\n\"What is he trying to do, anyway?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"He does not tell me all his secrets, but I've an idea he wants to\nkill you,\" replied Sacho. \"How absurd it is to be plotting such a\nthing when he might spend his time in laughing and being jolly!\nIsn't it, now?\"\n\n\"Zog is a wicked, wicked creature!\" exclaimed Trot.\n\n\"But he had his good points,\" replied Sacho cheerfully. \"There is no\none about in the world so bad that there is nothing good about him.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"What are Zog's good\npoints?\"\n\n\"All his slaves were saved from drowning, and he is kind to them,\"\nsaid Sacho.\n\n\"That is merely the kindness of selfishness,\" said Aquareine. \"Tell\nme, my lad, is the opening in the great dome outside guarded?\"\n\n\"Yes indeed,\" was the reply. \"You cannot hope to escape in that way,\nfor the prince of the sea devils, who is the largest and fiercest of\nhis race, lies crouched over the opening night and day, and none can\npass his network of curling legs.\"\n\n\"Is there no avenue that is not guarded?\" continued Aquareine.\n\n\"None at all, your Majesty. Zog is always careful to be well\nguarded, for he fears the approach of an enemy. What this enemy can\nbe to terrify the great magician I do not know, but Zog is always\nafraid and never leaves an entrance unguarded. Besides, it is an\nenchanted castle, you know, and none in the ocean can see it unless\nZog wishes him to. So it will be very hard for his enemy to find\nhim.\"\n\n\"We wish to escape,\" said Clia. \"Will you help us, Sacho?\"\n\n\"In any way I can,\" replied the boy.\n\n\"If we succeed, we will take you with us,\" continued the Princess.\n\nBut Sacho shook his head and laughed. \"I would indeed like to see\nyou escape Zog's vengeance,\" said he, \"for vengeance is wrong, and\nyou are too pretty and too good to be destroyed. But I am happy here\nand have no wish to go away, having no other home or friends other\nthan my fellow slaves.\"\n\nThen he left them, and when they were again alone, Aquareine said,\n\"We were able to escape Zog's attacks today, but I am quite sure he\nwill plan more powerful ways to destroy us. He has shown that he\nknows some clever magic, and perhaps I shall not be able to foil it.\nSo it will be well for us to escape tonight if possible.\"\n\n\"Can you fight and conquer the big sea devil up in the dome?\" asked\nTrot.\n\nThe queen was thoughtful, and did not reply to this question at\nonce. But Cap'n Bill said uneasily, \"I can't abide them devil\ncritters, an' I hopes, for my part, we won't be called on to tackle\n'em. You see, Trot, we're in consider'ble of a bad mess, an' if we\never live to tell the tale--\"\n\n\"Why not, Cap'n?\" asked the child. \"We're safe enough so far. Can't\nyou trust our good friend, the queen?\"\n\n\"She don't seem plumb sure o' things herself,\" remarked the sailor.\n\"The mermaids is all right an' friendly, mate, but this 'ere magic\nmaker, ol' Zog, is a bad one, out 'n' out, an' means to kill us if\nhe can.\"\n\n\"But he can't!\" cried Trot bravely.\n\n\"I hope you're right, dear. I wouldn't want to bet on Zog's chances\njes' yet, an' at the same time it would be riskin' money to bet on\nour chances. Seems to me it's a case of luck which wins.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, friend,\" said the Queen. \"I have a plan to save us.\nLet us wait patiently until nightfall.\" They waited in the Rose\nChamber a long time, talking earnestly together, but the brilliant\nlight that flooded both the room and the great dome outside did not\nfade in the least. After several hours had passed away, the gong\nsounded and Tom Atto again appeared, followed by four slaves bearing\nmany golden dishes upon silver trays. The friendly cook had prepared\na fine dinner, and they were all glad to find that, whatever Zog\nintended to do to them, he had no intention of starving them.\nPerhaps the magician realized that Aquareine's fairy powers, if put\nto the test, would be able to provide food for her companions, but\nwhatever his object may have been, their enemy had given them\nsplendid rooms and plenty to eat.\n\n\"Isn't it nearly nighttime?\" asked the Queen as Tom Atto spread the\ntable with a cloth of woven seaweed and directed his men to place\nthe dishes upon it.\n\n\"Night!\" he exclaimed as if surprised. \"There is no night here.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it ever get dark?\" inquired Trot.\n\n\"Never. We know nothing of the passage of time or of day or night.\nThe light always shines just as you see it now, and we sleep\nwhenever we are tired and rise again as soon as we are rested.\"\n\n\"What causes the light?\" Princess Clia asked.\n\n\"It's magic, your Highness,\" said the cook solemnly. \"It's one of\nthe curious things Zog is able to do. But you must remember all this\nplace is a big cave in which the castle stands, so the light is\nnever seen by anyone except those who live here.\"\n\n\"But why does Zog keep his light going all the time?\" asked the\nQueen.\n\n\"I suppose it is because he himself never sleeps,\" replied Tom Atto.\n\"They say the master hasn't slept for hundreds of years, not since\nAnko, the sea serpent, defeated him and drove him into this place.\"\n\nThey asked no more questions and began to eat their dinner in\nsilence. Before long, Cap'n Joe came in to visit his brother and\ntook a seat at the table with the prisoners. He proved a jolly\nfellow, and when he and Cap'n Bill talked about their boyhood days,\nthe stories were so funny that everybody laughed and for a time\nforgot their worries.\n\nWhen dinner was over, however, and Cap'n Joe had gone back to his\nwork of sewing on buttons and the servants had carried away the\ndishes, the prisoners remembered their troubles and the fate that\nawaited them. \"I am much disappointed,\" said the Queen, \"to find\nthere is no night here and that Zog never sleeps. It will make our\nescape more difficult. Yet we must make the attempt, and as we are\ntired and a great struggle is before us, it will be best for us to\nsleep and refresh ourselves.\"\n\nThey agreed to this, for the day had been long and adventurous, so\nCap'n Bill kissed Trot and went in to the Peony Room, where he lay\ndown upon his spongy couch and fell fast asleep. The mermaids and\nTrot followed this example, and I think none of them was much\nworried, after all, because they quickly sank into peaceful slumber\nand forgot all the dangers that threatened them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nTHE QUEEN'S GOLDEN SWORD\n\n\n\"Goodness me!\" exclaimed Trot, raising herself by a flirt of her\npink-scaled tail and a wave of her fins, \"isn't it dreadful hot\nhere?\"\n\nThe mermaids had risen at the same time, and Cap'n Bill came\nswimming in from the Peony Room in time to hear the little girl's\nspeech.\n\n\"Hot!\" echoed the sailor. \"Why, I feel like the inside of a steam\nengine!\"\n\nThe perspiration was rolling down his round, red face, and he took\nout his handkerchief and carefully wiped it away, waving his fish\ntail gently at the same time.\n\n\"What we need most in this room,\" said he, \"is a fan.\"\n\n\"What's the trouble, do you s'pose?\" inquired Trot.\n\n\"It is another trick of the monster Zog,\" answered the Queen calmly.\n\"He has made the water in our rooms boiling hot, and if it could\ntouch us, we would be well cooked by this time. Even as it is, we\nare all made uncomfortable by breathing the heated air.\"\n\n\"What shall we do, ma'am?\" the sailor man asked with a groan. \"I\nexpected to get into hot water afore we've done with this\nfoolishness, but I don't like the feel o' bein' parboiled, jes' the\nsame.\"\n\nThe queen was waving her fairy wand and paid no attention to Cap'n\nBill's moans. Already the water felt cooler, and they began to\nbreathe more easily. In a few moments more, the heat had passed from\nthe surrounding water altogether, and all danger from this source\nwas over.\n\n\"This is better,\" said Trot gratefully.\n\n\"Do you care to sleep again?\" asked the Queen.\n\n\"No, I'm wide awake now,\" answered the child.\n\n\"I'm afraid if I goes to sleep ag'in, I'll wake up a pot roast,\"\nsaid Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Let us consider ways to escape,\" suggested Clia. \"It seems useless\nfor us to remain here quietly until Zog discovers a way to destroy\nus.\"\n\n\"But we must not blunder,\" added Aquareine cautiously. \"To fail in\nour attempt would be to acknowledge Zog's superior power, so we must\nthink well upon our plan before we begin to carry it out. What do\nyou advise, sir?\" she asked, turning to Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"My opinion, ma'am, is that the only way for us to escape is to get\nout o' here,\" was the sailor's vague answer. \"How to do it is your\nbusiness, seein' as I ain't no fairy myself, either in looks or in\neddication.\"\n\nThe queen smiled and said to Trot, \"What is your opinion, my dear?\"\n\n\"I think we might swim out the same way we came in,\" answered the\nchild. \"If we could get Sacho to lead us back through the maze, we\nwould follow that long tunnel to the open ocean, and--\"\n\n\"And there would be the sea devils waitin' for us,\" added Cap'n Bill\nwith a shake of his bald head. \"They'd drive us back inter the\ntunnel like they did the first time, Trot. It won't do, mate, it\nwon't do.\"\n\n\"Have you a suggestion, Clia?\" inquired the Queen.\n\n\"I have thought of an undertaking,\" replied the pretty princess,\n\"but it is a bold plan, your Majesty, and you may not care to risk\nit.\"\n\n\"Let us hear it, anyway,\" said Aquareine encouragingly.\n\n\"It is to destroy Zog himself and put him out of the world forever.\nThen we would be free to go home whenever we pleased.\"\n\n\"Can you suggest a way to destroy Zog?\" asked Aquareine.\n\n\"No, your Majesty,\" Clia answered. \"I must leave the way for you to\ndetermine.\"\n\n\"In the old days,\" said the Queen thoughtfully, \"the mighty King\nAnko could not destroy this monster. He succeeded in defeating Zog\nand drove him into this great cavern, but even Anko could not\ndestroy him.\"\n\n\"I have heard the sea serpent explain that it was because he could\nnot reach the magician,\" returned Clia. \"If King Anko could have\nseized Zog in his coils, he would have made an end of the wicked\nmonster quickly. Zog knows this, and that is why he does not venture\nforth from his retreat. Anko is the enemy he constantly dreads. But\nwith you, my queen, the case is different. You may easily reach Zog,\nand the only question is whether your power is sufficient to destroy\nhim.\"\n\nFor a while Aquareine remained silent. \"I am not sure of my power\nover him,\" she said at last, \"and for that reason I hesitate to\nattack him personally. His slaves and his allies, the sea devils, I\ncan easily conquer, so I prefer to find a way to overcome the guards\nat the entrances rather than to encounter their terrible master. But\neven the guards have been given strength and power by the magician,\nas we have already discovered, so I must procure a weapon with which\nto fight them.\"\n\n\"A weapon, ma'am?\" said Cap'n Bill, and then he took a jackknife\nfrom his coat pocket and opened the big blade, afterward handing it\nto the queen. \"That ain't a bad weapon,\" he announced.\n\n\"But it is useless in this case,\" she replied, smiling at the old\nsailor's earnestness. \"For my purpose I must have a golden sword.\"\n\n\"Well, there's plenty of gold around this castle,\" said Trot,\nlooking around her. \"Even in this room there's enough to make a\nhundred golden swords.\"\n\n\"But we can't melt or forge gold under water, mate,\" the Cap'n said.\n\n\"Why not? Don't you s'pose all these gold roses and things were made\nunder water?\" asked the little girl.\n\n\"Like enough,\" remarked the sailor, \"but I don't see how.\"\n\nJust then the gong at the door sounded, and the boy Sacho came in\nsmiling and cheerful as ever. He said Zog had sent him to inquire\nafter their health and happiness. \"You may tell him that his water\nbecame a trifle too warm, so we cooled it,\" replied the Queen. Then\nthey told Sacho how the boiling water had made them uncomfortable\nwhile they slept.\n\nSacho whistled a little tune and seemed thoughtful. \"Zog is\nfoolish,\" said he. \"How often have I told him that vengeance is a\nwaste of time. He is worried to know how to destroy you, and that is\nwasting more time. You are worried for fear he will injure you, and\nso you also are wasting time. My, my! What a waste of time is going\non in this castle!\"\n\n\"Seems to me that we have so much time it doesn't matter,\" said\nTrot. \"What's time for, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Time is given us to be happy, and for no other reason,\" replied the\nboy soberly. \"When we waste time, we waste happiness. But there is\nno time for preaching, so I'll go.\"\n\n\"Please wait a moment, Sacho,\" said the Queen.\n\n\"Can I do anything to make you happy?\" he asked, smiling again.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Aquareine. \"We are curious to know who does all this\nbeautiful gold work and ornamentation.\"\n\n\"Some of the slaves here are goldsmiths, having been taught by Zog\nto forge and work metal under water,\" explained Sacho. \"In parts of\nthe ocean lie many rocks filled with veins of pure gold and golden\nnuggets, and we get large supplies from sunken ships as well. There\nis no lack of gold here, but it is not as precious as it is upon the\nearth because here we have no need of money.\"\n\n\"We would like to see the goldsmiths at work,\" announced the Queen.\n\nThe boy hesitated a moment. Then he said, \"I will take you to their\nroom, where you may watch them for a time. I will not ask Zog's\npermission to do this, for he might refuse. But my orders were to\nallow you the liberty of the castle, and so I will let you see the\ngoldsmiths' shop.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied Aquareine quietly, and then the four followed\nSacho along various corridors until they came to a large room where\na dozen men were busily at work. Lying here and there were heaps of\nvirgin gold, some in its natural state and some already fashioned\ninto ornaments and furniture of various sorts. Each man worked at a\nbench where there was a curious iron furnace in which glowed a\nvivid, white light. Although this workshop was all under water and\nthe workmen were all obliged to breathe as fishes do, the furnaces\nglowed so hot that the water touching them was turned into steam.\nGold or other metal held over a furnace quickly softened or melted,\nwhen it could be forged or molded into any shape desired.\n\n\"The furnaces are electric,\" explained Sacho, \"and heat as well\nunder water as they would in the open air. Let me introduce you to\nthe foreman, who will tell you of his work better than I can.\"\n\nThe foreman was a slave named Agga-Groo, who was lean and lank and\nhad an expression more surly and unhappy than any slave they had yet\nseen. Yet he seemed willing to leave his work and explain to the\nvisitors how he made so many beautiful things out of gold, for he\ntook much pride in this labor and knew its artistic worth. Moreover,\nsince he had been in Zog's castle these were the first strangers to\nenter his workshop, so he welcomed them in his own gruff way.\n\nThe queen asked him if he was happy, and he shook his head and\nreplied, \"It isn't like Calcutta, where I used to work in gold\nbefore I was wrecked at sea and nearly drowned. Zog rescued me and\nbrought me here a slave. It is a stupid life we lead, doing the same\nthings over and over every day, but perhaps it is better than being\ndead. I'm not sure. The only pleasure I get in life is in creating\npretty things out of gold.\"\n\n\"Could you forge me a golden sword?\" asked the Queen, smiling\nsweetly upon the goldsmith.\n\n\"I could, madam, but I won't unless Zog orders me to do it.\"\n\n\"Do you like Zog better than you do me?\" inquired Aquareine.\n\n\"No,\" was the answer. \"I hate Zog.\"\n\n\"Then won't you make the sword to please me and to show your skill?\"\npleaded the pretty mermaid.\n\n\"I'm afraid of my master. He might not like it,\" the man replied.\n\n\"But he will never know,\" said Princess Clia.\n\n\"You cannot say what Zog knows or what he doesn't know,\" growled the\nman. \"I can't take chances of offending Zog, for I must live with\nhim always as a slave.\" With this he turned away and resumed his\nwork, hammering the leaf of a golden ship.\n\nCap'n Bill had listened carefully to this conversation, and being a\nwise old sailor in his way, he thought he understood the nature of\nold Agga-Groo better than the mermaids did. So he went close to the\ngoldsmith, and feeling in the pockets of his coat drew out a silver\ncompass shaped like a watch. \"I'll give you this if you'll make the\nqueen the golden sword,\" he said.\n\nAgga-Groo looked at the compass with interest and tested its power\nof pointing north. Then he shook his head and handed it back to\nCap'n Bill. The sailor dived into his pocket again and pulled out a\npair of scissors, which he placed beside the compass on the palm of\nhis big hand. \"You may have them both,\" he said.\n\nAgga-Groo hesitated, for he wanted the scissors badly, but finally\nhe shook his head again. Cap'n Bill added a piece of cord, an iron\nthimble, some fishhooks, four buttons and a safety pin, but still\nthe goldsmith would not be tempted. So with a sigh the sailor\nbrought out his fine, big jackknife, and at sight of this\nAgga-Groo's eyes began to sparkle. Steel was not to be had at the\nbottom of the sea, although gold was so plentiful. \"All right,\nfriend,\" he said. \"Give me that lot of trinkets and I'll make you a\npretty gold sword. But it won't be any good except to look at, for\nour gold is so pure that it is very soft.\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" replied Cap'n Bill. \"All we want is the sword.\"\n\nThe goldsmith set to work at once, and so skillful was he that in a\nfew minutes he had forged a fine sword of yellow gold with an\nornamental handle. The shape was graceful and the blade keen and\nslender. It was evident to them all that the golden sword would not\nstand hard use, for the edge of the blade would nick and curl like\nlead, but the queen was delighted with the prize and took it eagerly\nin her hand.\n\nJust then Sacho returned to say that they must go back to their\nrooms, and after thanking the goldsmith, who was so busy examining\nhis newly acquired treasure that he made no response, they joyfully\nfollowed the boy back to the Rose Chamber. Sacho told them that he\nhad just come from Zog, who was still wasting time in plotting\nvengeance. \"You must be careful,\" he advised them, \"for my cruel\nmaster intends to stop you from living, and he may succeed. Don't be\nunhappy, but be careful. Zog is angry because you escaped his\nYell-Maker and the falling stones and the hot water. While he is\nangry he is wasting time, but that will not help you. Take care not\nto waste any time yourselves.\"\n\n\"Do you know what Zog intends to do to us next?\" asked Princess\nClia.\n\n\"No,\" said Sacho, \"but it is reasonable to guess that, being evil,\nhe intends evil. He never intends to do good, I assure you.\" Then\nthe boy went away.\n\n\"I am no longer afraid,\" declared the Mermaid Queen when they were\nalone. \"When I have bestowed certain fairy powers upon this golden\nsword, it will fight its way against any who dare oppose us, and\neven Zog himself will not care to face so powerful a weapon. I am\nnow able to promise you that we shall make our escape.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried Trot joyfully. \"Shall we start now?\"\n\n\"Not yet, my dear. It will take me a little while to charm this\ngolden blade so that it will obey my commands and do my work. There\nis no need of undue haste, so I propose we all sleep for a time and\nobtain what rest we can. We must be fresh and ready for our great\nadventure.\"\n\nAs their former nap had been interrupted, they readily agreed to\nAquareine's proposal and at once went to their couches and composed\nthemselves to slumber. When they were asleep, the fairy mermaid\ncharmed her golden sword and then she also lay down to rest herself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nA DASH FOR LIBERTY\n\n\nTrot dreamed that she was at home in her own bed, but the night\nseemed chilly and she wanted to draw the coverlet up to her chin.\nShe was not wide awake, but realized that she was cold and unable to\nmove her arms to cover herself up. She tried, but could not stir.\nThen she roused herself a little more and tried again. Yes, it was\ncold, very cold! Really, she MUST do something to get warm, she\nthought. She opened her eyes and stared at a great wall of ice in\nfront of her.\n\nShe was awake now, and frightened, too. But she could not move\nbecause the ice was all around her. She was frozen inside of it, and\nthe air space around her was not big enough to allow her to turn\nover.\n\nAt once the little girl realized what had happened. Their wicked\nenemy Zog had by his magic art frozen all the water in their room\nwhile they slept, and now they were all imprisoned and helpless.\nTrot and Cap'n Bill were sure to freeze to death in a short time,\nfor only a tiny air space remained between their bodies and the ice,\nand this air was like that of a winter day when the thermometer is\nbelow zero.\n\nAcross the room Trot could see the mermaid queen lying on her couch,\nfor the solid ice was clear as crystal. Aquareine was imprisoned\njust as Trot was, and although she held her fairy wand in one hand\nand the golden sword in the other, she seemed unable to move either\nof them, and the girl remembered that the queen always waved her\nmagic wand to accomplish anything. Princess Clia's couch was behind\nthat of Trot, so the child could not see her, and Cap'n Bill was in\nhis own room, probably frozen fast in the ice as the others were.\n\nThe terrible Zog has surely been very clever in this last attempt to\ndestroy them. Trot thought it all over, and she decided that\ninasmuch as the queen was unable to wave her fairy wand, she could\ndo nothing to release herself or her friends.\n\nBut in this the girl was mistaken. The fairy mermaid was even now at\nwork trying to save them, and in a few minutes Trot was astonished\nand delighted to see the queen rise from her couch. She could not go\nfar from it at first, but the ice was melting rapidly all around her\nso that gradually Aquareine approached the place where the child\nlay. Trot could hear the mermaid's voice sounding through the ice as\nif from afar off, but it grew more distinct until she could make out\nthat the queen was saying, \"Courage, friends! Do not despair, for\nsoon you will be free.\"\n\nBefore very long the ice between Trot and the queen had melted away\nentirely, and with a cry of joy the little girl flopped her pink\ntail and swam to the side of her deliverer.\n\n\"Are you very cold?\" asked Aquareine.\n\n\"N-not v-v-very!\" replied Trot, but her teeth chattered and she was\nstill shivering.\n\n\"The water will be warm in a few minutes,\" said the Queen. \"But now\nI must melt the rest of the ice and liberate Clia.\"\n\nThis she did in an astonishingly brief time, and the pretty\nprincess, being herself a fairy, had not been at all affected by the\ncold surrounding her.\n\nThey now swam to the door of Cap'n Bill's room and found the Peony\nChamber a solid block of ice. The queen worked her magic power as\nhard as she could, and the ice flowed and melted quickly before her\nfairy wand. Yet when they reached the old sailor, he was almost\nfrozen stiff, and Trot and Clia had to rub his hands and nose and\nears very briskly to warm him up and bring him back to life.\n\nCap'n Bill was pretty tough, and he came around, in time, and opened\nhis eyes and sneezed and asked if the blizzard was over. So the\nqueen waved her wand over his head a few times to restore him to his\nnatural condition of warmth, and soon the old sailor became quite\ncomfortable and was able to understand all about the strange\nadventure from which he had so marvelously escaped.\n\n\"I've made up my mind to one thing, Trot,\" he said confidentially.\n\"If ever I get out o' this mess I'm in, I won't be an Arctic\nexplorer, whatever else happens. Shivers an' shakes ain't to my\nlikin', an' this ice business ain't what it's sometimes cracked up\nto be. To be friz once is enough fer anybody, an' if I was a gal\nlike you, I wouldn't even wear frizzes on my hair.\"\n\n\"You haven't any hair, Cap'n Bill,\" answered Trot, \"so you needn't\nworry.\"\n\nThe queen and Clia had been talking together very earnestly. They\nnow approached their earth friends, and Aquareine said:\n\n\"We have decided not to remain in this castle any longer. Zog's\ncruel designs upon our lives and happiness are becoming too\ndangerous for us to endure. The golden sword now bears a fairy\ncharm, and by its aid I will cut a way through our enemies. Are you\nready and willing to follow me?\"\n\n\"Of course we are!\" cried Trot.\n\n\"It don't seem 'zactly right to ask a lady to do the fightin',\"\nremarked Cap'n Bill, \"but magic ain't my strong p'int, and it seems\nto be yours, ma'am. So swim ahead, and we'll wiggle the same way you\ndo, an' try to wiggle out of our troubles.\"\n\n\"If I chance to fail,\" said the Queen, \"try not to blame me. I will\ndo all in my power to provide for our escape, and I am willing to\nrisk everything, because I well know that to remain here will mean\nto perish in the end.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Trot with fine courage. \"Let's have it over\nwith.\"\n\n\"Then we will leave here at once,\" said Aquareine.\n\nShe approached the window of the room and with one blow of her\ngolden sword shattered the thick pane of glass. The opening thus\nmade was large enough for them to swim through if they were careful\nnot to scrape against the broken points of glass. The queen went\nfirst, followed by Trot and Cap'n Bill, with Clia last of all.\n\nAnd now they were in the vast dome in which the castle and gardens\nof Zog had been built. Around them was a clear stretch of water, and\nfar above--full half a mile distant--was the opening in the roof\nguarded by the prince of the sea devils. The mermaid queen had\ndetermined to attack this monster. If she succeeded in destroying it\nwith her golden sword, the little band of fugitives might then swim\nthrough the opening into the clear waters of the ocean. Although\nthis prince of the sea devils was said to be big and wise and\nmighty, there was but one of him to fight; whereas, if they\nattempted to escape through any of the passages, they must encounter\nscores of such enemies.\n\n\"Swim straight for the opening in the dome!\" cried Aquareine, and in\nanswer to the command, the four whisked their glittering tails,\nwaved their fins, and shot away through the water at full speed,\ntheir course slanting upward toward the top of the dome.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nKING ANKO TO THE RESCUE\n\n\nThe great magician Zog never slept. He was always watchful and\nalert. Some strange power warned him that his prisoners were about\nto escape.\n\nScarcely had the four left the castle by the broken window when the\nmonster stepped from a doorway below and saw them. Instantly he blew\nupon a golden whistle, and at the summons a band of wolf-fish\nappeared and dashed after the prisoners. These creatures swam so\nswiftly that soon they were between the fugitives and the dome, and\nthen they turned and with wicked eyes and sharp fangs began a fierce\nattack upon the mermaids and the earth dwellers.\n\nTrot was a little frightened at the evil looks of the sea wolves,\nwhose heads were enormous, and whose jaws contained rows of curved\nand pointed teeth. But Aquareine advanced upon them with her golden\nsword, and every touch of the charmed weapon instantly killed an\nenemy, so that one by one the wolf-fish rolled over upon their backs\nand sank helplessly downward through the water, leaving the\nprisoners free to continue their way toward the opening in the dome.\n\nZog witnessed the destruction of his wolves and uttered a loud laugh\nthat was terrible to hear. Then the dread monster determined to\narrest the fugitives himself, and in order to do this he was forced\nto discover himself in all the horror of his awful form, a form he\nwas so ashamed of and loathed so greatly that he always strove to\nkeep it concealed, even from his own view. But it was important that\nhis prisoners should not escape. Hastily casting off the folds of\nthe robe that enveloped him, Zog allowed his body to uncoil and\nshoot upward through the water in swift pursuit of his victims. His\ncloven hoofs, upon which he usually walked, being now useless, were\ndrawn up under him, while coil after coil of his eel-like body\nwriggled away like a serpent. At his shoulders two broad, feathery\nwings expanded, and these enabled the monster to cleave his way\nthrough the water with terrific force.\n\nZog was part man, part beast, part fish, part fowl, and part\nreptile. His undulating body was broad and thin and like the body of\nan eel. It was as repulsive as one could well imagine, and no wonder\nZog hated it and kept it covered with his robe. Now, with his horned\nhead and its glowing eyes thrust forward, wings flapping from his\nshoulders and his eely body--ending in a fish's tail--wriggling far\nbehind him, this strange and evil creature was a thing of terror\neven to the sea dwellers, who were accustomed to remarkable sights.\n\nThe mermaids, the sailor and the child, one after another looking\nback as they swam toward liberty and safety, saw the monster coming\nand shuddered with uncontrollable fear. They were drawing nearer to\nthe dome by this time, yet it was still some distance away. The four\nredoubled their speed, darting through the water with the swiftness\nof skyrockets. But fast as they swam, Zog swam faster, and the good\nqueen's heart began to throb as she realized she would be forced to\nfight her loathesome foe.\n\nPresently Zog's long body was circling around them like a whirlwind,\nlashing the water into foam and gradually drawing nearer and nearer\nto his victims. His eyes were no longer glowing coals, they were\nballs of flame, and as he circled around them, he laughed aloud that\nhorrible laugh which was far more terrifying than any cry of rage\ncould be. The queen struck out with her golden sword, but Zog\nwrapped a coil of his thin body around it and, wrestling it from her\nhand, crushed the weapon into a shapeless mass. Then Aquareine waved\nher fairy wand, but in a flash the monster sent it flying away\nthrough the water.\n\nCap'n Bill now decided that they were lost. He drew Trot closer to\nhis side and placed one arm around her. \"I can't save you, dear\nlittle mate,\" he said sadly, \"but we've lived a long time together,\nan' now we'll die together. I knew, Trot, when first we sawr them\nmermaids, as we'd--we'd--\"\n\n\"Never live to tell the tale,\" said the child. \"But never mind,\nCap'n Bill, we've done the best we could, and we've had a fine\ntime.\"\n\n\"Forgive me! Oh, forgive me!\" cried Aquareine despairingly. \"I tried\nto save you, my poor friends, but--\"\n\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed the Princess, pointing upward. They all\nlooked past Zog's whirling body, which was slowly enveloping them in\nits folds, toward the round opening in the dome. A dark object had\nappeared there, sliding downward like a huge rope and descending\ntoward them with lightning rapidly. They gave a great gasp as they\nrecognized the countenance of King Anko, the sea serpent, its gray\nhair and whiskers bristling like those of an angry cat, and the\nusually mild blue eyes glowing with a ferocity even more terrifying\nthan the orbs of Zog.\n\nThe magician gave a shrill scream at sight of his dreaded enemy, and\nabandoning his intended victims, Zog made a quick dash to escape.\nBut nothing in the sea could equal the strength and quickness of\nKing Anko when he was roused. In a flash the sea serpent had caught\nZog fast in his coils, and his mighty body swept round the monster\nand imprisoned him tightly. The four, so suddenly rescued, swam away\nto a safer distance from the struggle, and then they turned to watch\nthe encounter between the two great opposing powers of the ocean's\ndepths. Yet there was no desperate fight to observe, for the\ncombatants were unequal. The end came before they were aware of it.\nZog had been taken by surprise, and his great fear of Anko destroyed\nall of his magic power. When the sea serpent slowly released those\nawful coils, a mass of jelly-like pulp floated downward through the\nwater with no remnant of life remaining in it, no form to show it\nhad once been Zog, the Magician.\n\nThen Anko shook his body that the water might cleanse it, and\nadvanced his head toward the group of four whom he had so\nopportunely rescued. \"It is all over, friends,\" said he in his\ngentle tones, while a mild expression once more reigned on his\ncomical features. \"You may go home at any time you please, for the\nway through the dome will be open as soon as I get my own body\nthrough it.\"\n\nIndeed, so amazing was the length of the great sea serpent that only\na part of him had descended through the hole into the dome. Without\nwaiting for the thanks of those he had rescued, he swiftly retreated\nto the ocean above, and with grateful hearts they followed him, glad\nto leave the cavern where they had endured so much anxiety and\ndanger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nTHE HOME OF THE OCEAN MONARCH\n\n\nTrot sobbed quietly with her head on Cap'n Bill's shoulder. She had\nbeen a brave little girl during the trying times they had\nexperienced and never once had she given way to tears, however\ndesperate their fate had seemed to be. But now that the one enemy in\nall the sea to be dreaded was utterly destroyed and all dangers were\npast, the reaction was so great that she could not help having \"just\none good cry,\" as she naively expressed it.\n\nCap'n Bill was a big sailor man hardened by age and many adventures,\nbut even he felt a \"Lump in his throat\" that he could not swallow,\ntry as hard as he might. Cap'n Bill was glad. He was mostly glad on\nTrot's account, for he loved his sweet, childish companion very\ndearly, and did not want any harm to befall her.\n\nThey were now in the wide, open sea, with liberty to go wherever\nthey wished, and if Cap'n Bill could have \"had his way,\" he would\nhave gone straight home and carried Trot to her mother. But the\nmermaids must be considered. Aquareine and Clia had been true and\nfaithful friends to their earth guests while dangers were\nthreatening, and it would not be very gracious to leave them at\nonce. Moreover, King Anko was now with them, his big head keeping\npace with the mermaids as they swam, and this mighty preserver had a\ndistinct claim upon Trot and Cap'n Bill. The sailor felt that it\nwould not be polite to ask to go home so soon.\n\n\"If you people had come to visit me as I invited you to do,\" said\nthe Sea Serpent, \"all this bother and trouble would have been saved.\nI had my palace put in order to receive the earth dwellers and sat\nin my den waiting patiently to receive you. Yet you never came at\nall.\"\n\n\"That reminds me,\" said Trot, drying her eyes, \"you never told us\nabout that third pain you once had.\"\n\n\"Finally,\" continued Anko, \"I sent to inquire as to what had become\nof you, and Merla said you had been gone from the palace a long time\nand she was getting anxious about you. Then I made inquiries.\nEveryone in the sea loves to serve me--except those sea devils and\ntheir cousins, the octopi--and it wasn't long before I heard you had\nbeen captured by Zog.\"\n\n\"Was the third pain as bad as the other two?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Naturally this news disturbed me and made me unhappy,\" said Anko,\n\"for I well knew, my Aquareine, that the magician's evil powers were\ngreater than your own fairy accomplishments. But I had never been\nable to find Zog's enchanted castle, and so I was at a loss to know\nhow to save you from your dreadful fate. After I had wasted a good\ndeal of time thinking it over, I decided that if the sea devils were\nslaves of Zog, the prince of the sea devils must know where the\nenchanted castle was located.\n\n\"I knew this prince and where to find him, for he always lay on a\nhollow rock on the bottom of the sea and never moved from that\nposition. His people brought food to him and took his commands. So I\nhad no trouble in finding this evil prince, and I went to him and\nasked the way to Zog's castle. Of course, he would not tell me. He\nwas even cross and disrespectful, just as I had expected him to be,\nso I allowed myself to become angry and killed him, thinking he was\nmuch better dead than alive. But after the sea devil was destroyed,\nwhat was my surprise to find that all these years he had been lying\nover a round hole in the rock and covering it with his scarlet body!\n\n\"A light shone through this hole, so I thrust my head in and found a\ngreat domed cave underneath with a splendid silver castle built at\nthe bottom. You, my friends, were at that moment swimming toward me\nas fast as you could come, and the monster Zog, my enemy for\ncenturies past, was close behind you. Well, the rest of the story\nyou know. I would be angry with all of you for so carelessly getting\ncaptured, had the incident not led to the destruction of the one\nevil genius in all my ocean. I shall rest easier and be much happier\nnow that Zog is dead. He has defied me for hundreds of years.\"\n\n\"But about that third pain,\" said Trot. \"If you don't tell us now,\nI'm afraid that I'll forget to ask you.\"\n\n\"If you should happen to forget, just remind me of it,\" said Anko,\n\"and I'll be sure to tell you.\"\n\nWhile Trot was thinking this over, the swimmers drew near to a\ngreat, circular palace made all of solid alabaster polished as\nsmooth as ivory. Its roof was a vast dome, for domes seemed to be\nfashionable in the ocean houses. There were no doors or windows, but\ninstead of these, several round holes appeared in different parts of\nthe dome, some being high up and some low down and some in between.\nOut of one of these holes, which it just fitted, stretched the long,\nbrown body of the sea serpent. Trot, being astonished at this sight,\nasked, \"Didn't you take all of you when you went to the cavern,\nAnko?\"\n\n\"Nearly all, my dear,\" was the reply, accompanied by a cheerful\nsmile, for Anko was proud of his great length. \"But not quite all.\nSome of me remained, as usual, to keep house while my head was away.\nBut I've been coiling up ever since we started back, and you will\nsoon be able to see every inch of me all together.\"\n\nEven as he spoke, his head slid into the round hole, and at a signal\nfrom Aquareine they all paused outside and waited. Presently there\ncame to them four beautiful winged fishes with faces like doll\nbabies. Their long hair and eyelashes were of a purple color, and\ntheir cheeks had rosy spots that looked as if they had been painted\nupon them. \"His Majesty bids you welcome,\" said one of the doll\nfishes in a sweet voice. \"Be kind enough to enter the royal palace,\nand our ocean monarch will graciously receive you.\"\n\n\"Seems to me,\" said Trot to the queen, \"these things are putting on\nairs. Perhaps they don't know we're friends of Anko.\"\n\n\"The king insists on certain formalities when anyone visits him,\"\nwas Aquareine's reply. \"It is right that his dignity should be\nmaintained.\"\n\nThey followed their winged conductors to one of the upper openings,\nand as they entered it Aquareine said in a clear voice, \"May the\nglory and power of the ocean king continue forever!\" Then she\ntouched the palm of her hand to her forehead in token of allegiance,\nand Clia did the same, so Cap'n Bill and Trot followed suit. The\nbrief ceremony being ended, the child looked curiously around to see\nwhat the palace of the mighty Anko was like.\n\nAn extensive hall lined with alabaster was before them. In the floor\nwere five of the round holes. Upon the walls were engraved many\ninteresting scenes of ocean life, all chiseled very artistically by\nthe tusks of walruses who, Trot was afterward informed, are greatly\nskilled in such work. A few handsome rugs of woven sea grasses were\nspread upon the floor, but otherwise the vast hall was bare of\nfurniture. The doll-faced fishes escorted them to an upper room\nwhere a table was set, and here the revelers were invited to refresh\nthemselves. As all four were exceedingly hungry, they welcomed the\nrepast, which was served by an army of lobsters in royal purple\naprons and caps.\n\nThe meal being finished, they again descended to the hall, which\nseemed to occupy all the middle of the building. And now their\nconductors said, \"His Majesty is ready to receive you in his den.\"\n\nThey swam downward through one of the round holes in the floor and\nfound themselves in a brilliantly lighted chamber which appeared\nbigger than all the rest of the palace put together. In the center\nwas the quaint head of King Anko, and around it was spread a great\ncoverlet of purple and gold woven together. This concealed all of\nhis body and stretched from wall to wall of the circular room.\n\"Welcome, friends!\" said Anko pleasantly. \"How do you like my home?\"\n\n\"It's very grand,\" replied Trot.\n\n\"Just the place for a sea serpent, seems to me,\" said Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"I'm glad you admire it,\" said the King. \"Perhaps I ought to tell\nyou that from this day you four belong to me.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" asked the girl, surprised.\n\n\"It is a law of the ocean,\" declared Anko, \"that whoever saves any\nliving creature from violent death owns that creature forever\nafterward, while life lasts. You will realize how just this law is\nwhen you remember that had I not saved you from Zog, you would now\nbe dead. The law was suggested by Captain Kid Glove, when he once\nvisited me.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Captain Kidd?\" asked Trot. \"Because if you do--\"\n\n\"Give him his full name,\" said Anko. \"Captain Kid Glove was--\"\n\n\"There's no glove to it,\" protested Trot. \"I ought to know, 'cause\nI've read about him.\"\n\n\"Didn't it say anything about a glove?\" asked Anko.\n\n\"Nothing at all. It jus' called him Cap'n Kidd,\" replied Trot.\n\n\"She's right, ol' man,\" added Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Books,\" said the Sea Serpent, \"are good enough as far as they go,\nbut it seems to me your earth books don't go far enough. Captain Kid\nGlove was a gentleman pirate, a kid-glove pirate. To leave off the\nglove and call him just Kidd is very disrespectful.\"\n\n\"Oh! You told me to remind you of that third pain,\" said the little\ngirl.\n\n\"Which proves my friendship for you,\" returned the Sea Serpent,\nblinking his blue eyes thoughtfully. \"No one likes to be reminded of\na pain, and that third pain was--was--\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"It was a stomach ache,\" replied the King with a sigh.\n\n\"What made it?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Just my carelessness,\" said Anko. \"I'd been away to foreign parts,\nseeing how the earth people were getting along. I found the Germans\ndancing the german and the Dutch making dutch cheese and the\nBelgians combing their belgian hares and the Turks eating turkey and\nthe Sardinians sardonically pickling sardines. Then I called on the\nPrince of Whales, and--\"\n\n\"You mean the Prince of Wales,\" corrected Trot.\n\n\"I mean what I say, my dear. I saw the battlefield where the Bull\nRun but the Americans didn't, and when I got to France I paid a\nnapoleon to see Napoleon with his boney apart. He was--\"\n\n\"Of course you mean--\" Trot was beginning, but the king would not\ngive her a chance to correct him this time.\n\n\"He was very hungry for Hungary,\" he continued, \"and was Russian so\nfast toward the Poles that I thought he'd discover them. So as I was\nnot accorded a royal welcome, I took French leave and came home\nagain.\"\n\n\"But the pain--\"\n\n\"On the way home,\" continued Anko calmly, \"I was a little\nabsent-minded and ate an anchor. There was a long chain attached to\nit, and as I continued to swallow the anchor I continued to eat the\nchain. I never realized what I had done until I found a ship on the\nother end of the chain. Then I bit it off.\"\n\n\"The ship?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"No, the chain. I didn't care for the ship, as I saw it contained\nsome skippers. On the way home the chain and anchor began to lie\nheavily on my stomach. I didn't seem to digest them properly, and by\nthe time I got to my palace, where you will notice there is no\nthrone, I was thrown into throes of severe pain. So I at once sent\nfor Dr. Shark--\"\n\n\"Are all your doctors sharks?\" asked the child.\n\n\"Yes, aren't your doctors sharks?\" he replied.\n\n\"Not all of them,\" said Trot.\n\n\"That is true,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"But when you talk of\nlawyers--\"\n\n\"I'm not talking of lawyers,\" said Anko reprovingly. \"I'm talking\nabout my pain. I don't imagine anyone could suffer more than I did\nwith that stomach ache.\"\n\n\"Did you suffer long?\" inquired Trot.\n\n\"Why, about seven thousand four hundred and eighty-two feet and--\"\n\n\"I mean a long time.\"\n\n\"It seemed like a long time,\" answered the King. \"Dr. Shark said I\nought to put a mustard poultice on my stomach, so I uncoiled myself\nand summoned my servants, and they began putting on the mustard\nplaster. It had to be bound all around me so it wouldn't slip off,\nand I began to look like an express package. In about four weeks\nfully one-half of the pain had been covered by the mustard poultice,\nwhich got so hot that it hurt me worse than the stomach ache did.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Trot. \"I had one, once.\"\n\n\"One what?\" asked Anko.\n\n\"A mustard plaster. They smart pretty bad, but I guess they're a\ngood thing.\"\n\n\"I got myself unwrapped as soon as I could,\" continued the King,\n\"and then I hunted for the doctor, who hid himself until my anger\nhad subsided. He has never sent in a bill, so I think he must be\nterribly ashamed of himself.\"\n\n\"You're lucky, sir, to have escaped so easy,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"But\nyou seem pretty well now.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm more careful of what I eat,\" replied the Sea Serpent. \"But\nI was saying when Trot interrupted me, that you all belong to me,\nbecause I have saved your lives. By the law of the ocean, you must\nobey me in everything.\"\n\nThe sailor scowled a little at hearing this, but Trot laughed and\nsaid, \"The law of the ocean isn't OUR law, 'cause we live on land.\"\n\n\"Just now you are living in the ocean,\" declared Anko, \"and as long\nas you live here, you must obey my commands.\"\n\n\"What are your commands?\" inquired the child.\n\n\"Ah, that's the point I was coming to,\" returned the King with his\ncomical smile. \"The ocean is a beautiful place, and we who belong\nhere love it dearly. In many ways it's a nicer place for a home than\nthe earth, for we have no sunstroke, mosquitoes, earthquakes or\ncandy ships to bother us. But I am convinced that the ocean is no\nproper dwelling place for earth people, and I believe the mermaids\ndid an unwise thing when they invited you to visit them.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" protested the girl. \"We've had a fine time, haven't we,\nCap'n Bill?\"\n\n\"Well, it's been diff'rent from what I expected,\" admitted the\nsailor.\n\n\"Our only thought was to give the earth people pleasure, your\nMajesty,\" pleaded Aquareine.\n\n\"I know, I know, my dear Queen, and it was very good of you,\"\nreplied Anko. \"But still it was an unwise act, for earth people are\nas constantly in danger under water as we would be upon the land. So\nhaving won the right to command you all, I order you to take little\nMayre and Cap'n Bill straight home, and there restore them to their\nnatural forms. It's a dreadful condition, I know, and they must each\nhave two stumbling legs instead of a strong, beautiful fish tail,\nbut it is the fate of earth dwellers, and they cannot escape it.\"\n\n\"In my case, your Majesty, make it ONE leg,\" suggested Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"Ah yes, I remember. One leg and a wooden stick to keep it company.\nI issue this order, dear friends, not because I am not fond of your\nsociety, but to keep you from getting into more trouble in a country\nwhere all is strange and unnatural to you. Am I right, or do you\nthink I am wrong?\"\n\n\"You're quite correct, sir,\" said Cap'n Bill, nodding his head in\napproval.\n\n\"Well, I'm ready to go home,\" said Trot. \"But in spite of Zog, I've\nenjoyed my visit, and I shall always love the mermaids for being so\ngood to me.\" That speech pleased Aquareine and Clia, who smiled upon\nthe child and kissed her affectionately.\n\n\"We shall escort you home at once,\" announced the Queen.\n\n\"But before you go,\" said King Anko, \"I will give you a rare treat.\nIt is one you will remember as long as you live. You shall see every\ninch of the mightiest sea serpent in the world, all at one time!\"\n\nAs he spoke, the purple and gold cloth was lifted by unseen hands\nand disappeared from view. And now Cap'n Bill and Trot looked down\nupon thousands and thousands of coils of the sea serpent's body,\nwhich filled all of the space at the bottom of the immense circular\nroom. It reminded them of a great coil of garden hose, only it was\nso much bigger around and very much longer.\n\nExcept for the astonishing size of the Ocean King, the sight was not\nan especially interesting one, but they told old Anko that they were\npleased to see him, because it was evident he was very fond of his\nfigure. Then the cloth descended again and covered all but the head,\nafter which they bade the king goodbye and thanked him for all his\nkindness to them.\n\n\"I used to think sea serpents were horrid creatures,\" said Trot,\n\"but now I know they are good and--and--and--\"\n\n\"And big,\" added Cap'n Bill, realizing his little friend could not\nfind another word that was complimentary.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nKING JOE\n\n\nAs they swam out of Anko's palace and the doll-faced fishes left\nthem, Aquareine asked:\n\n\"Would you rather go back to our mermaid home for a time and rest\nyourselves or would you prefer to start for Giant's Cave at once?\"\n\n\"I guess we'd better go back home,\" decided Trot. \"To our own home,\nI mean. We've been away quite a while, and King Anko seemed to think\nit was best.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the Queen. \"Let us turn in this direction,\nthen.\"\n\n\"You can say goodbye to Merla for us,\" continued Trot. \"She was very\nnice to us, an' 'specially to Cap'n Bill.\"\n\n\"So she was, mate,\" agreed the sailor, \"an' a prettier lady I never\nknew, even if she is a mermaid, beggin' your pardon, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Are we going anywhere near Zog's castle?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Our way leads directly past the opening in the dome,\" said\nAquareine.\n\n\"Then let's stop and see what Sacho and the others are doing,\"\nsuggested Trot. \"They can't be slaves any longer, you know, 'cause\nthey haven't any master. I wonder if they're any happier than they\nwere before?\"\n\n\"They seemed to be pretty happy as it was,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.\n\n\"It will do no harm to pay them a brief visit,\" said Princess Clia.\n\"All danger disappeared from the cavern with the destruction of\nZog.\"\n\n\"I really ought to say goodbye to Brother Joe,\" observed the sailor\nman. \"I won't see him again, you know, and I don't want to seem\nunbrotherly.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Queen, \"we will reenter the cavern, for I,\ntoo, am anxious to know what will be the fate of the poor slaves of\nthe magician.\"\n\nWhen they came to the hole in the top of the dome, they dropped\nthrough it and swam leisurely down toward the castle. The water was\nclear and undisturbed and the silver castle looked very quiet and\npeaceful under the radiant light that still filled the cavern. They\nmet no one at all, and passing around to the front of the building,\nthey reached the broad entrance and passed into the golden hall.\n\nHere a strange scene met their eyes. All the slaves of Zog, hundreds\nin number, were assembled in the room, while standing before the\nthrone formerly occupied by the wicked magician was the boy Sacho,\nwho was just beginning to make a speech to his fellow slaves. \"At\none time or another,\" he said, \"all of us were born upon the earth\nand lived in the thin air, but now we are all living as the fishes\nlive, and our home is in the water of the ocean. One by one we have\ncome to this place, having been saved from drowning by Zog, the\nMagician, and by him given power to exist in comfort under water.\nThe powerful master who made us his slaves has now passed away\nforever, but we continue to live, and are unable to return to our\nnative land, where we would quickly perish. There is no one but us\nto inherit Zog's possessions, and so it will be best for us to\nremain in this fine castle and occupy ourselves as we have done\nbefore, in providing for the comforts of the community. Only in\nlabor is happiness to be found, and we may as well labor for\nourselves as for others.\n\n\"But we must have a king. Not an evil, cruel master like Zog, but\none who will maintain order and issue laws for the benefit of all.\nWe will govern ourselves most happily by having a ruler, or head,\nselected from among ourselves by popular vote. Therefore I ask you\nto decide who shall be our king, for only one who is accepted by all\ncan sit in Zog's throne.\"\n\nThe slaves applauded this speech, but they seemed puzzled to make\nthe choice of a ruler. Finally the chief cook came forward and said,\n\"We all have our duties to perform and so cannot spend the time to\nbe king. But you, Sacho, who were Zog's own attendant, have now no\nduties at all. So it will be best for you to rule us. What say you,\ncomrades? Shall we make Sacho king?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" they all cried.\n\n\"But I do not wish to be king,\" replied Sacho. \"A king is a useless\nsort of person who merely issues orders for others to carry out. I\nwant to be busy and useful. Whoever is king will need a good\nattendant as well as an officer who will see that his commands are\nobeyed. I am used to such duties, having served Zog in this same\nway.\"\n\n\"Who, then, has the time to rule over us?\" asked Agga-Groo, the\ngoldsmith.\n\n\"It seems to me that Cap'n Joe is the proper person for king,\"\nreplied Sacho. \"His former duty was to sew buttons on Zog's\ngarments, so now he is out of a job and has plenty of time to be\nking, for he can sew on his own buttons. What do you say, Cap'n\nJoe?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" agreed Cap'n Joe. \"That is, if you all want me\nto rule you.\"\n\n\"We do!\" shouted the slaves, glad to find someone willing to take\nthe job.\n\n\"But I'll want a few pointers,\" continued Cap'n Bill's brother. \"I\nain't used to this sort o' work, you know, an' if I ain't properly\nposted I'm liable to make mistakes.\"\n\n\"Sacho will tell you,\" said Tom Atto encouragingly. \"And now I must\ngo back to the kitchen and look after my dumplings, or you people\nwon't have any dinner today.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" announced Sacho. \"I hereby proclaim Cap'n Joe elected\nKing of the Castle, which is the Enchanted Castle no longer. You may\nall return to your work.\"\n\nThe slaves went away well contented, and the boy and Cap'n Joe now\ncame forward to greet their visitors. \"We're on our way home,\"\nexplained Cap'n Bill, \"an' we don't expec' to travel this way again.\nBut it pleases me to know, Joe, that you're the king o' such a fine\ncastle, an' I'll rest easier now that you're well pervided for.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right, Bill,\" returned Cap'n Joe. \"It's an easy life\nhere, an' a peaceful one. I wish you were as well fixed.\"\n\n\"If ever you need friends, Sacho, or any assistance or counsel, come\nto me,\" said the Mermaid Queen to the boy.\n\n\"Thank you, madam,\" he replied. \"Now that Zog has gone, I am sure we\nshall be very safe and contented. But I shall not forget to come to\nyou if we need you. We are not going to waste any time in anger or\nrevenge or evil deeds, so I believe we shall prosper from now on.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will,\" declared Trot.\n\nThey now decided that they must continue their journey, and as\nneither Sacho nor King Joe could ascend to the top of the dome\nwithout swimming in the human way, which was slow and tedious work\nfor them, the goodbyes were said at the castle entrance, and the\nfour visitors started on their return. Trot took one last view of\nthe beautiful silver castle from the hole high up in the dome, which\nwas now open and unguarded, and the next moment she was in the broad\nocean again, swimming toward home beside her mermaid friends.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nTROT LIVES TO TELL THE TALE\n\n\nAquareine was thoughtful for a time. Then she drew from her finger a\nring, a plain gold band set with a pearl of great value, and gave it\nto the little girl.\n\n\"If at any period of your life the mermaids can be of service to\nyou, my dear,\" she said, \"you have but to come to the edge of the\nocean and call 'Aquareine.' If you are wearing the ring at the time,\nI shall instantly hear you and come to your assistance.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" cried the child, slipping the ring over her own chubby\nfinger, which it fitted perfectly. \"I shall never forget that I have\ngood and loyal friends in the ocean, you may be sure.\"\n\nAway and away they swam, swiftly and in a straight line, keeping in\nthe middle water where they were not liable to meet many sea people.\nThey passed a few schools of fishes, where the teachers were\nexplaining to the young ones how to swim properly, and to conduct\nthemselves in a dignified manner, but Trot did not care to stop and\nwatch the exercises.\n\nAlthough the queen had lost her fairy wand in Zog's domed chamber,\nshe had still enough magic power to carry them all across the ocean\nin wonderfully quick time, and before Trot and Cap'n Bill were aware\nof the distance they had come, the mermaids paused while Princess\nClia said:\n\n\"Now we must go a little deeper, for here is the Giant's Cave and\nthe entrance to it is near the bottom of the sea.\"\n\n\"What, already?\" cried the girl joyfully, and then through the dark\nwater they swam, passing through the rocky entrance, and began to\nascend slowly into the azure-blue water of the cave.\n\n\"You've been awfully good to us, and I don't know jus' how to thank\nyou,\" said Trot earnestly.\n\n\"We have enjoyed your visit to us,\" said beautiful Queen Aquareine,\nsmiling upon her little friend, \"and you may easily repay any\npleasure we have given you by speaking well of the mermaids when you\nhear ignorant earth people condemning us.\"\n\n\"I'll do that, of course,\" exclaimed the child.\n\n\"How about changin' us back to our reg'lar shapes?\" inquired Cap'n\nBill anxiously.\n\n\"That will be very easy,\" replied Princess Clia with her merry\nlaugh. \"See! Here we are at the surface of the water.\"\n\nThey pushed their heads above the blue water and looked around the\ncave. It was silent and deserted. Floating gently near the spot\nwhere they had left it was their own little boat. Cap'n Bill swam to\nit, took hold of the side, and then turned an inquiring face toward\nthe mermaids. \"Climb in,\" said the Queen. So he pulled himself up\nand awkwardly tumbled forward into the boat. As he did so, he heard\nhis wooden leg clatter against the seat, and turned around to look\nat it wonderingly.\n\n\"It's me, all right!\" he muttered. \"One meat one, an' one hick'ry\none. That's the same as belongs to me!\"\n\n\"Will you lift Mayre aboard?\" asked Princess Clia.\n\nThe old sailor aroused himself, and as Trot lifted up her arms, he\nseized them and drew her safely into the boat. She was dressed just\nas usual, and her chubby legs wore shoes and stockings. Strangely\nenough, neither of them were at all wet or even damp in any part of\ntheir clothing.\n\n\"I wonder where our legs have been while we've been gone?\" mused\nCap'n Bill, gazing at his little friend in great delight.\n\n\"And I wonder what's become of our pretty pink and green scaled\ntails!\" returned the girl, laughing with glee, for it seemed good to\nbe herself again.\n\nQueen Aquareine and Princess Clia were a little way off, lying with\ntheir pretty faces just out of the water while their hair floated in\nsoft clouds around them.\n\n\"Goodbye, friends!\" they called.\n\n\"Goodbye!\" shouted both Trot and Cap'n Bill, and the little girl\nblew two kisses from her fingers toward the mermaids.\n\nThen the faces disappeared, leaving little ripples on the surface of\nthe water.\n\nCap'n Bill picked up the oars and slowly headed the boat toward the\nmouth of the cave.\n\n\"I wonder, Trot, if your ma has missed us,\" he remarked uneasily.\n\n\"Of course not,\" replied the girl. \"She's been sound asleep, you\nknow.\"\n\nAs the boat crept out into the bright sunlight, they were both\nsilent, but each sighed with pleasure at beholding their own\neveryday world again.\n\nFinally Trot said softly, \"The land's the best, Cap'n.\"\n\n\"It is, mate, for livin' on,\" he answered.\n\n\"But I'm glad to have seen the mermaids,\" she added..\n\n\"Well, so'm I, Trot,\" he agreed. \"But I wouldn't 'a' believed any\nmortal could ever 'a' seen 'em an'--an'--\"\n\nTrot laughed merrily.\n\n\"An' lived to tell the tale!\" she cried, her eyes dancing with\nmischief. \"Oh, Cap'n Bill, how little we mortals know!\"\n\n\"True enough, mate,\" he replied, \"but we're a-learnin' something\nev'ry day.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Sea Fairies, by L.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
