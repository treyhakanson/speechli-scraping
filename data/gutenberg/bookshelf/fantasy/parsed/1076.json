THE TRANSMUTATION OF LING\n\nI: INTRODUCTION\n\nThe sun had dipped behind the western mountains before Kai Lung, with\ntwenty li or more still between him and the city of Knei Yang, entered\nthe camphor-laurel forest which stretched almost to his destination.\nNo person of consequence ever made the journey unattended; but Kai Lung\nprofessed to have no fear, remarking with extempore wisdom, when warned\nat the previous village, that a worthless garment covered one with\nbetter protection than that afforded by an army of bowmen. Nevertheless,\nwhen within the gloomy aisles, Kai Lung more than once wished himself\nback at the village, or safely behind the mud walls of Knei Yang; and,\nmaking many vows concerning the amount of prayer-paper which he would\nassuredly burn when he was actually through the gates, he stepped\nout more quickly, until suddenly, at a turn in the glade, he stopped\naltogether, while the watchful expression into which he had unguardedly\ndropped at once changed into a mask of impassiveness and extreme\nunconcern. From behind the next tree projected a long straight rod, not\nunlike a slender bamboo at a distance, but, to Kai Lung's all-seeing\neye, in reality the barrel of a matchlock, which would come into line\nwith his breast if he took another step. Being a prudent man, more\naccustomed to guile and subservience to destiny than to force, he\ntherefore waited, spreading out his hands in proof of his peaceful\nacquiescence, and smiling cheerfully until it should please the owner\nof the weapon to step forth. This the unseen did a moment later, still\nkeeping his gun in an easy and convenient attitude, revealing a stout\nbody and a scarred face, which in conjunction made it plain to Kai Lung\nthat he was in the power of Lin Yi, a noted brigand of whom he had heard\nmuch in the villages.\n\n\"O illustrious person,\" said Kai Lung very earnestly, \"this is evidently\nan unfortunate mistake. Doubtless you were expecting some exalted\nMandarin to come and render you homage, and were preparing to overwhelm\nhim with gratified confusion by escorting him yourself to your\nwell-appointed abode. Indeed, I passed such a one on the road, very\nrichly apparelled, who inquired of me the way to the mansion of the\ndignified and upright Lin Yi. By this time he is perhaps two or three li\ntowards the east.\"\n\n\"However distinguished a Mandarin may be, it is fitting that I should\nfirst attend to one whose manners and accomplishments betray him to be\nof the Royal House,\" replied Lin Yi, with extreme affability. \"Precede\nme, therefore, to my mean and uninviting hovel, while I gain more\nhonour than I can reasonably bear by following closely in your elegant\nfootsteps, and guarding your Imperial person with this inadequate but\nheavily-loaded weapon.\"\n\nSeeing no chance of immediate escape, Kai Lung led the way, instructed\nby the brigand, along a very difficult and bewildering path, until they\nreached a cave hidden among the crags. Here Lin Yi called out some words\nin the Miaotze tongue, whereupon a follower appeared, and opened a gate\nin the stockade of prickly mimosa which guarded the mouth of the den.\nWithin the enclosure a fire burned, and food was being prepared. At a\nword from the chief, the unfortunate Kai Lung found his hands seized and\ntied behind his back, while a second later a rough hemp rope was fixed\nround his neck, and the other end tied to an overhanging tree.\n\nLin Yi smiled pleasantly and critically upon these preparations, and\nwhen they were complete dismissed his follower.\n\n\"Now we can converse at our ease and without restraint,\" he remarked to\nKai Lung. \"It will be a distinguished privilege for a person occupying\nthe important public position which you undoubtedly do; for myself,\nmy instincts are so degraded and low-minded that nothing gives me more\ngratification than to dispense with ceremony.\"\n\nTo this Kai Lung made no reply, chiefly because at that moment the wind\nswayed the tree, and compelled him to stand on his toes in order to\nescape suffocation.\n\n\"It would be useless to try to conceal from a person of your inspired\nintelligence that I am indeed Lin Yi,\" continued the robber. \"It is a\ndignified position to occupy, and one for which I am quite incompetent.\nIn the sixth month of the third year ago, it chanced that this unworthy\nperson, at that time engaged in commercial affairs at Knei Yang, became\ninextricably immersed in the insidious delights of quail-fighting.\nHaving been entrusted with a large number of taels with which to\npurchase elephants' teeth, it suddenly occurred to him that if he\ndoubled the number of taels by staking them upon an exceedingly powerful\nand agile quail, he would be able to purchase twice the number of teeth,\nand so benefit his patron to a large extent. This matter was clearly\nforced upon his notice by a dream, in which he perceived one whom he\nthen understood to be the benevolent spirit of an ancestor in the act\nof stroking a particular quail, upon whose chances he accordingly\nplaced all he possessed. Doubtless evil spirits had been employed in the\nmatter; for, to this person's great astonishment, the quail in question\nfailed in a very discreditable manner at the encounter. Unfortunately,\nthis person had risked not only the money which had been entrusted to\nhim, but all that he had himself become possessed of by some years of\nhonourable toil and assiduous courtesy as a professional witness in\nlaw cases. Not doubting that his patron would see that he was himself\ngreatly to blame in confiding so large a sum of money to a comparatively\nyoung man of whom he knew little, this person placed the matter before\nhim, at the same time showing him that he would suffer in the eyes of\nthe virtuous if he did not restore this person's savings, which but for\nthe presence of the larger sum, and a generous desire to benefit his\npatron, he would never have risked in so uncertain a venture as that of\nquail-fighting. Although the facts were laid in the form of a dignified\nrequest instead of a demand by legal means, and the reasoning carefully\ndrawn up in columns of fine parchment by a very illustrious writer, the\nreply which this person received showed him plainly that a wrong view\nhad been taken of the matter, and that the time had arrived when it\nbecame necessary for him to make a suitable rejoinder by leaving the\ncity without delay.\"\n\n\"It was a high-minded and disinterested course to take,\" said Kai\nLung with great conviction, as Lin Yi paused. \"Without doubt evil will\nshortly overtake the avaricious-souled person at Knei Yang.\"\n\n\"It has already done so,\" replied Lin Yi. \"While passing through this\nforest in the season of Many White Vapours, the spirits of his bad deeds\nappeared to him in misleading and symmetrical shapes, and drew him out\nof the path and away from his bowmen. After suffering many torments, he\nfound his way here, where, in spite of our continual care, he perished\nmiserably and in great bodily pain.... But I cannot conceal from\nmyself, in spite of your distinguished politeness, that I am becoming\nintolerably tiresome with my commonplace talk.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied Kai Lung, \"while listening to your voice I\nseemed to hear the beating of many gongs of the finest and most polished\nbrass. I floated in the Middle Air, and for the time I even became\nunconscious of the fact that this honourable appendage, though\nfashioned, as I perceive, out of the most delicate silk, makes it\nexceedingly difficult for me to breathe.\"\n\n\"Such a thing cannot be permitted,\" exclaimed Lin Yi, with some\nindignation, as with his own hands he slackened the rope and, taking it\nfrom Kai Lung's neck, fastened it around his ankle. \"Now, in return for\nmy uninviting confidences, shall not my senses be gladdened by a recital\nof the titles and honours borne by your distinguished family? Doubtless,\nat this moment many Mandarins of the highest degree are anxiously\nawaiting your arrival at Knei Yang, perhaps passing the time by outdoing\none another in protesting the number of taels each would give rather\nthan permit you to be tormented by fire-brands, or even to lose a single\near.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" replied Kai Lung, \"never was there a truer proverb than that\nwhich says, 'It is a mark of insincerity of purpose to spend one's\ntime in looking for the sacred Emperor in the low-class tea-shops.'\nDo Mandarins or the friends of Mandarins travel in mean garments and\nunattended? Indeed, the person who is now before you is none other than\nthe outcast Kai Lung, the story-teller, one of degraded habits and no\nvery distinguished or reputable ancestors. His friends are few, and\nmostly of the criminal class; his wealth is not more than some six or\neight cash, concealed in his left sandal; and his entire stock-in-trade\nconsists of a few unendurable and badly told stories, to which, however,\nit is his presumptuous intention shortly to add a dignified narrative\nof the high-born Lin Yi, setting out his domestic virtues and the\nhonour which he has reflected upon his house, his valour in war, the\ndestruction of his enemies, and, above all, his great benevolence and\nthe protection which he extends to the poor and those engaged in the\ndistinguished arts.\"\n\n\"The absence of friends is unfortunate,\" said Lin Yi thoughtfully, after\nhe had possessed himself of the coins indicated by Kai Lung, and also\nof a much larger amount concealed elsewhere among the story-teller's\nclothing. \"My followers are mostly outlawed Miaotze, who have been\ndriven from their own tribes in Yun Nan for man-eating and disregarding\nthe sacred laws of hospitality. They are somewhat rapacious, and in this\nway it has become a custom that they should have as their own, for\nthe purpose of exchanging for money, persons such as yourself, whose\ninsatiable curiosity has led them to this place.\"\n\n\"The wise and all-knowing Emperor Fohy instituted three degrees of\nattainment: Being poor, to obtain justice; being rich, to escape\nflattery; and being human, to avoid the passions,\" replied Kai Lung.\n\"To these the practical and enlightened Kang added yet another, the\ngreatest: Being lean, to yield fatness.\"\n\n\"In such cases,\" observed the brigand, \"the Miaotze keep an honoured and\nvery venerable rite, which chiefly consists in suspending the offender\nby a pigtail from a low tree, and placing burning twigs of hemp-palm\nbetween his toes. To this person it seems a foolish and meaningless\nhabit; but it would not be well to interfere with their religious\nobservances, however trivial they may appear.\"\n\n\"Such a course must inevitably end in great loss,\" suggested Kai Lung;\n\"for undoubtedly there are many poor yet honourable persons who would\nleave with them a bond for a large number of taels and save the money\nwith which to redeem it, rather than take part in a ceremony which is\nnot according to one's own Book of Rites.\"\n\n\"They have already suffered in that way on one or two occasions,\"\nreplied Lin Yi; \"so that such a proposal, no matter how nobly intended,\nwould not gladden their faces. Yet they are simple and docile persons,\nand would, without doubt, be moved to any feeling you should desire by\nthe recital of one of your illustrious stories.\"\n\n\"An intelligent and discriminating assemblage is more to a story-teller\nthan much reward of cash from hands that conceal open mouths,\" replied\nKai Lung with great feeling. \"Nothing would confer more pleasurable\nagitation upon this unworthy person than an opportunity of narrating\nhis entire stock to them. If also the accomplished Lin Yi would bestow\nrenown upon the occasion by his presence, no omen of good would be\nwanting.\"\n\n\"The pleasures of the city lie far behind me,\" said Lin Yi, after\nsome thought, \"and I would cheerfully submit myself to an intellectual\naccomplishment such as you are undoubtedly capable of. But as we have\nnecessity to leave this spot before the hour when the oak-leaves change\ninto night-moths, one of your amiable stories will be the utmost we can\nstrengthen our intellects with. Select which you will. In the meantime,\nfood will be brought to refresh you after your benevolent exertions\nin conversing with a person of my vapid understanding. When you have\npartaken, or thrown it away as utterly unendurable, the time will have\narrived, and this person, together with all his accomplices, will put\nthemselves in a position to be subjected to all the most dignified\nemotions.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\n\"The story which I have selected for this gratifying occasion,\" said Kai\nLung, when, an hour or so later, still pinioned, but released from the\nhalter, he sat surrounded by the brigands, \"is entitled 'Good and\nEvil,' and it is concerned with the adventures of one Ling, who bore the\nhonourable name of Ho. The first, and indeed the greater, part of\nthe narrative, as related by the venerable and accomplished writer\nof history Chow-Tan, is taken up by showing how Ling was assuredly\ndescended from an enlightened Emperor of the race of Tsin; but as the\nno less omniscient Ta-lin-hi proves beyond doubt that the person in\nquestion was in no way connected with any but a line of hereditary\nape-worshippers, who entered China from an unknown country many\ncenturies ago, it would ill become this illiterate person to express\nan opinion on either side, and he will in consequence omit the first\nseventeen books of the story, and only deal with the three which refer\nto the illustrious Ling himself.\"\n\n\nTHE STORY OF LING\n\nNarrated by Kai Lung when a prisoner in the camp of Lin Yi.\n\nLing was the youngest of three sons, and from his youth upwards proved\nto be of a mild and studious disposition. Most of his time was spent in\nreading the sacred books, and at an early age he found the worship of\napes to be repulsive to his gentle nature, and resolved to break through\nthe venerable traditions of his family by devoting his time to literary\npursuits, and presenting himself for the public examinations at Canton.\nIn this his resolution was strengthened by a rumour that an army of\nbowmen was shortly to be raised from the Province in which he lived,\nso that if he remained he would inevitably be forced into an occupation\nwhich was even more distasteful to him than the one he was leaving.\n\nHaving arrived at Canton, Ling's first care was to obtain particulars of\nthe examinations, which he clearly perceived, from the unusual\nactivity displayed on all sides, to be near at hand. On inquiring from\npassers-by, he received very conflicting information; for the persons to\nwhom he spoke were themselves entered for the competition, and therefore\nnaturally misled him in order to increase their own chances of success.\nPerceiving this, Ling determined to apply at once, although the light\nwas past, to a Mandarin who was concerned in the examinations, lest by\ndelay he should lose his chance for the year.\n\n\"It is an unfortunate event that so distinguished a person should have\nselected this day and hour on which to overwhelm us with his affable\npoliteness!\" exclaimed the porter at the gate of the Yamen, when Ling\nhad explained his reason for going. \"On such a day, in the reign of the\nvirtuous Emperor Hoo Chow, a very benevolent and unassuming ancestor of\nmy good lord the Mandarin was destroyed by treachery, and ever since his\nfamily has observed the occasion by fasting and no music. This person\nwould certainly be punished with death if he entered the inner room from\nany cause.\"\n\nAt these words, Ling, who had been simply brought up, and chiefly in the\nsociety of apes, was going away with many expressions of self-reproach\nat selecting such a time, when the gate-keeper called him back.\n\n\"I am overwhelmed with confusion at the position in which I find\nmyself,\" he remarked, after he had examined his mind for a short time.\n\"I may meet with an ungraceful and objectionable death if I carry out\nyour estimable instructions, but I shall certainly merit and receive\na similar fate if I permit so renowned and versatile a person to leave\nwithout a fitting reception. In such matters a person can only trust to\nthe intervention of good spirits; if, therefore, you will permit this\nunworthy individual to wear, while making the venture, the ring which he\nperceives upon your finger, and which he recognizes as a very powerful\ncharm against evil, misunderstandings, and extortion, he will go without\nfear.\"\n\nOverjoyed at the amiable porter's efforts on his behalf, Ling did as he\nwas desired, and the other retired. Presently the door of the Yamen was\nopened by an attendant of the house, and Ling bidden to enter. He\nwas covered with astonishment to find that this person was entirely\nunacquainted with his name or purpose.\n\n\"Alas!\" said the attendant, when Ling had explained his object, \"well\nsaid the renowned and inspired Ting Fo, 'When struck by a thunderbolt it\nis unnecessary to consult the Book of Dates as to the precise meaning\nof the omen.' At this moment my noble-minded master is engaged in\nconversation with all the most honourable and refined persons in Canton,\nwhile singers and dancers of a very expert and nimble order have been\nsent for. The entertainment will undoubtedly last far into the night,\nand to present myself even with the excuse of your graceful and delicate\ninquiry would certainly result in very objectionable consequences to\nthis person.\"\n\n\"It is indeed a day of unprepossessing circumstances,\" replied Ling,\nand after many honourable remarks concerning his own intellect and\nappearance, and those of the person to whom he was speaking, he had\nturned to leave when the other continued:\n\n\"Ever since your dignified presence illumined this very ordinary\nchamber, this person has been endeavouring to bring to his mind an\nincident which occurred to him last night while he slept. Now it has\ncome back to him with a diamond clearness, and he is satisfied that it\nwas as follows: While he floated in the Middle Air a benevolent spirit\nin the form of an elderly and toothless vampire appeared, leading by\nthe hand a young man, of elegant personality. Smiling encouragingly upon\nthis person, the spirit said, 'O Fou, recipient of many favours from\nMandarins and of innumerable taels from gratified persons whom you have\nobliged, I am, even at this moment, guiding this exceptional young man\ntowards your presence; when he arrives do not hesitate, but do as he\ndesires, no matter how great the danger seems or how inadequately you\nmay appear to be rewarded on earth.' The vision then melted, but I now\nclearly perceive that with the exception of the embroidered cloak which\nyou wear, you are the person thus indicated to me. Remove your cloak,\ntherefore, in order to give the amiable spirit no opportunity of denying\nthe fact, and I will advance your wishes; for, as the Book of Verses\nindicates, 'The person who patiently awaits a sign from the clouds\nfor many years, and yet fails to notice the earthquake at his feet, is\ndevoid of intellect.'\"\n\nConvinced that he was assuredly under the especial protection of the\nDeities, and that the end of his search was in view, Ling gave his rich\ncloak to the attendant, and was immediately shown into another room,\nwhere he was left alone.\n\nAfter a considerable space of time the door opened and there entered a\nperson whom Ling at first supposed to be the Mandarin. Indeed, he was\naddressing him by his titles when the other interrupted him. \"Do not\ndistress your incomparable mind by searching for honourable names\nto apply to so inferior a person as myself,\" he said agreeably. \"The\nmistake is, nevertheless, very natural; for, however miraculous it may\nappear, this unseemly individual, who is in reality merely a writer of\nspoken words, is admitted to be exceedingly like the dignified Mandarin\nhimself, though somewhat stouter, clad in better garments, and, it is\nsaid, less obtuse of intellect. This last matter he very much doubts,\nfor he now finds himself unable to recognize by name one who is\nundoubtedly entitled to wear the Royal Yellow.\"\n\nWith this encouragement Ling once more explained his position, narrating\nthe events which had enabled him to reach the second chamber of the\nYamen. When he had finished the secretary was overpowered with a\nhigh-minded indignation.\n\n\"Assuredly those depraved and rapacious persons who have both misled and\nrobbed you shall suffer bow-stringing when the whole matter is brought\nto light,\" he exclaimed. \"The noble Mandarin neither fasts nor receives\nguests, for, indeed, he has slept since the sun went down. This person\nwould unhesitatingly break his slumber for so commendable a purpose were\nit not for a circumstance of intolerable unavoidableness. It must not\neven be told in a low breath beyond the walls of the Yamen, but my\nbenevolent and high-born lord is in reality a person of very miserly\ninstinct, and nothing will call him from his natural sleep but the sound\nof taels shaken beside his bed. In an unexpected manner it comes about\nthat this person is quite unsupplied with anything but thin printed\npapers of a thousand taels each, and these are quite useless for the\npurpose.\"\n\n\"It is unendurable that so obliging a person should be put to such\ninconvenience on behalf of one who will certainly become a public\nlaughing-stock at the examinations,\" said Ling, with deep feeling; and\ntaking from a concealed spot in his garments a few taels, he placed them\nbefore the secretary for the use he had indicated.\n\nLing was again left alone for upwards of two strokes of the gong, and\nwas on the point of sleep when the secretary returned with an expression\nof dignified satisfaction upon his countenance. Concluding that he\nhad been successful in the manner of awakening the Mandarin, Ling was\nopening his mouth for a polite speech, which should contain a delicate\nallusion to the taels, when the secretary warned him, by affecting a\nsudden look of terror, that silence was exceedingly desirable, and at\nthe same time opened another door and indicated to Ling that he should\npass through.\n\nIn the next room Ling was overjoyed to find himself in the presence\nof the Mandarin, who received him graciously, and paid many estimable\ncompliments to the name he bore and the country from which he came.\nWhen at length Ling tore himself from this enchanting conversation, and\nexplained the reason of his presence, the Mandarin at once became a prey\nto the whitest and most melancholy emotions, even plucking two hairs\nfrom his pigtail to prove the extent and conscientiousness of his grief.\n\n\"Behold,\" he cried at length, \"I am resolved that the extortionate and\nmany-handed persons at Peking who have control of the examination rites\nand customs shall no longer grow round-bodied without remark. This\nperson will unhesitatingly proclaim the true facts of the case without\nregarding the danger that the versatile Chancellor or even the sublime\nEmperor himself may, while he speaks, be concealed in some part of this\nunassuming room to hear his words; for, as it is wisely said, 'When\nmarked out by destiny, a person will assuredly be drowned, even though\nhe passes the whole of his existence among the highest branches of a\ndate tree.'\"\n\n\"I am overwhelmed that I should be the cause of such an engaging display\nof polished agitation,\" said Ling, as the Mandarin paused. \"If it would\nmake your own stomach less heavy, this person will willingly follow your\nestimable example, either with or without knowing the reason.\"\n\n\"The matter is altogether on your account, O most unobtrusive young\nman,\" replied the Mandarin, when a voice without passion was restored\nto him. \"It tears me internally with hooks to reflect that you, whose\nrefined ancestors I might reasonably have known had I passed my youth\nin another Province, should be victim to the cupidity of the ones in\nauthority at Peking. A very short time before you arrived there came a\nmessenger in haste from those persons, clearly indicating that a legal\ntoll of sixteen taels was to be made on each printed paper setting forth\nthe time and manner of the examinations, although, as you may see, the\npaper is undoubtedly marked, 'Persons are given notice that they are\ndefrauded of any sum which they may be induced to exchange for this\nmatter.' Furthermore, there is a legal toll of nine taels on all persons\nwho have previously been examined--\"\n\n\"I am happily escaped from that,\" exclaimed Ling with some satisfaction\nas the Mandarin paused.\n\n\"--and twelve taels on all who present themselves for the first time.\nThis is to be delivered over when the paper is purchased, so that you,\nby reason of this unworthy proceeding at Peking, are required to forward\nto that place, through this person, no less than thirty-two taels.\"\n\n\"It is a circumstance of considerable regret,\" replied Ling; \"for had\nI only reached Canton a day earlier, I should, it appears, have avoided\nthis evil.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly it would have been so,\" replied the Mandarin, who had\nbecome engrossed in exalted meditation. \"However,\" he continued a\nmoment later, as he bowed to Ling with an accomplished smile, \"it\nwould certainly be a more pleasant thought for a person of your refined\nintelligence that had you delayed until to-morrow the insatiable persons\nat Peking might be demanding twice the amount.\"\n\nPondering the deep wisdom of this remark, Ling took his departure; but\nin spite of the most assiduous watchfulness he was unable to discern any\nof the three obliging persons to whose efforts his success had been due.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nIt was very late when Ling again reached the small room which he had\nselected as soon as he reached Canton, but without waiting for food or\nsleep he made himself fully acquainted with the times of the forthcoming\nexaminations and the details of the circumstances connected with them.\nWith much satisfaction he found that he had still a week in which to\nrevive his intellect on the most difficult subjects. Having become\nrelieved on these points, Ling retired for a few hours' sleep, but rose\nagain very early, and gave the whole day with great steadfastness to\ncontemplation of the sacred classics Y-King, with the exception of a\nshort period spent in purchasing ink, brushes and writing-leaves. The\nfollowing day, having become mentally depressed through witnessing\nunaccountable hordes of candidates thronging the streets of Canton,\nLing put aside his books, and passed the time in visiting all the most\ncelebrated tombs in the neighbourhood of the city. Lightened in mind\nby this charitable and agreeable occupation, he returned to his studies\nwith a fixed resolution, nor did he again falter in his purpose. On the\nevening of the examination, when he was sitting alone, reading by the\naid of a single light, as his custom was, a person arrived to see him,\nat the same time manifesting a considerable appearance of secrecy\nand reserve. Inwardly sighing at the interruption, Ling nevertheless\nreceived him with distinguished consideration and respect, setting tea\nbefore him, and performing towards it many honourable actions with his\nown hands. Not until some hours had sped in conversation relating to\nthe health of the Emperor, the unexpected appearance of a fiery dragon\noutside the city, and the insupportable price of opium, did the visitor\nallude to the object of his presence.\n\n\"It has been observed,\" he remarked, \"that the accomplished Ling, who\naspires to a satisfactory rank at the examinations, has never before\nmade the attempt. Doubtless in this case a preternatural wisdom will\navail much, and its fortunate possessor will not go unrewarded. Yet\nit is as precious stones among ashes for one to triumph in such\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"The fact is known to this person,\" replied Ling sadly, \"and the thought\nof the years he may have to wait before he shall have passed even the\nfirst degree weighs down his soul with bitterness from time to time.\"\n\n\"It is no infrequent thing for men of accomplished perseverance, but\nmerely ordinary intellects, to grow venerable within the four walls\nof the examination cell,\" continued the other. \"Some, again, become\nafflicted with various malignant evils, while not a few, chiefly those\nwho are presenting themselves for the first time, are so overcome on\nperceiving the examination paper, and understanding the inadequate\nnature of their own accomplishments, that they become an easy prey to\nthe malicious spirits which are ever on the watch in those places; and,\nafter covering their leaves with unpresentable remarks and drawings\nof men and women of distinguished rank, have at length to be forcibly\ncarried away by the attendants and secured with heavy chains.\"\n\n\"Such things undoubtedly exist,\" agreed Ling; \"yet by a due regard paid\nto spirits, both good and bad, a proper esteem for one's ancestors, and\na sufficiency of charms about the head and body, it is possible to be\ncloseted with all manner of demons and yet to suffer no evil.\"\n\n\"It is undoubtedly possible to do so, according to the Immortal\nPrinciples,\" admitted the stranger; \"but it is not an undertaking in\nwhich a refined person would take intelligent pleasure; as the proverb\nsays, 'He is a wise and enlightened suppliant who seeks to discover\nan honourable Mandarin, but he is a fool who cries out, \"I have found\none.\"' However, it is obvious that the reason of my visit is understood,\nand that your distinguished confidence in yourself is merely a graceful\nendeavour to obtain my services for a less amount of taels than I should\notherwise have demanded. For half the usual sum, therefore, this person\nwill take your place in the examination cell, and enable your versatile\nname to appear in the winning lists, while you pass your moments in\nirreproachable pleasures elsewhere.\"\n\nSuch a course had never presented itself to Ling. As the person who\nnarrates this story has already marked, he had passed his life beyond\nthe influence of the ways and manners of towns, and at the same time\nhe had naturally been endowed with an unobtrusive highmindedness. It\nappeared to him, in consequence, that by accepting this engaging offer\nhe would be placing those who were competing with him at a disadvantage.\nThis person clearly sees that it is a difficult matter for him to\nexplain how this could be, as Ling would undoubtedly reward the services\nof the one who took his place, nor would the number of the competitors\nbe in any way increased; yet in such a way the thing took shape before\nhis eyes. Knowing, however, that few persons would be able to understand\nthis action, and being desirous of not injuring the estimable emotions\nof the obliging person who had come to him, Ling made a number of\npolished excuses in declining, hiding the true reason within himself. In\nthis way he earned the powerful malignity of the person in question,\nwho would not depart until he had effected a number of very disagreeable\nprophecies connected with unpropitious omens and internal torments, all\nof which undoubtedly had a great influence on Ling's life beyond that\ntime.\n\nEach day of the examination found Ling alternately elated or depressed,\naccording to the length and style of the essay which he had written\nwhile enclosed in his solitary examination cell. The trials each lasted\na complete day, and long before the fifteen days which composed the full\nexamination were passed, Ling found himself half regretting that he had\nnot accepted his visitor's offer, or even reviling the day on which he\nhad abandoned the hereditary calling of his ancestors. However, when,\nafter all was over, he came to deliberate with himself on his chances of\nattaining a degree, he could not disguise from his own mind that he had\nwell-formed hopes; he was not conscious of any undignified errors, and,\nin reply to several questions, he had been able to introduce\ncurious knowledge which he possessed by means of his exceptional\ncircumstances--knowledge which it was unlikely that any other candidate\nwould have been able to make himself master of.\n\nAt length the day arrived on which the results were to be made public;\nand Ling, together with all the other competitors and many distinguished\npersons, attended at the great Hall of Intellectual Coloured Lights\nto hear the reading of the lists. Eight thousand candidates had been\nexamined, and from this number less than two hundred were to be selected\nfor appointments. Amid a most distinguished silence the winning names\nwere read out. Waves of most undignified but inevitable emotion passed\nover those assembled as the list neared its end, and the chances of\nsuccess became less at each spoken word; and then, finding that his\nwas not among them, together with the greater part of those present, he\nbecame a prey to very inelegant thoughts, which were not lessened by the\nrefined cries of triumph of the successful persons. Among this confusion\nthe one who had read the lists was observed to be endeavouring to make\nhis voice known, whereupon, in the expectation that he had omitted a\nname, the tumult was quickly subdued by those who again had pleasurable\nvisions.\n\n\"There was among the candidates one of the name of Ling,\" said he, when\nno-noise had been obtained. \"The written leaves produced by this person\nare of a most versatile and conflicting order, so that, indeed, the\naccomplished examiners themselves are unable to decide whether they\nare very good or very bad. In this matter, therefore, it is clearly\nimpossible to place the expert and inimitable Ling among the foremost,\nas his very uncertain success may have been brought about with the\nassistance of evil spirits; nor would it be safe to pass over his\nefforts without reward, as he may be under the protection of powerful\nbut exceedingly ill-advised deities. The estimable Ling is told to\nappear again at this place after the gong has been struck three times,\nwhen the matter will have been looked at from all round.\"\n\nAt this announcement there arose another great tumult, several crying\nout that assuredly their written leaves were either very good or very\nbad; but no further proclamation was made, and very soon the hall was\ncleared by force.\n\nAt the time stated Ling again presented himself at the Hall, and was\nhonourably received.\n\n\"The unusual circumstances of the matter have already been put forth,\"\nsaid an elderly Mandarin of engaging appearance, \"so that nothing\nremains to be made known except the end of our despicable efforts to\ncome to an agreeable conclusion. In this we have been made successful,\nand now desire to notify the result. A very desirable and not\nunremunerative office, rarely bestowed in this manner, is lately vacant,\nand taking into our minds the circumstances of the event, and the fact\nthat Ling comes from a Province very esteemed for the warlike instincts\nof its inhabitants, we have decided to appoint him commander of the\nvaliant and blood-thirsty band of archers now stationed at Si-chow, in\nthe Province of Hu-Nan. We have spoken. Let three guns go off in honour\nof the noble and invincible Ling, now and henceforth a commander in\nthe ever-victorious Army of the Sublime Emperor, brother of the Sun and\nMoon, and Upholder of the Four Corners of the World.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nMany hours passed before Ling, now more downcast in mind than the most\nunsuccessful student in Canton, returned to his room and sought his\ncouch of dried rushes. All his efforts to have his distinguished\nappointment set aside had been without avail, and he had been ordered to\nreach Si-chow within a week. As he passed through the streets, elegant\nprocessions in honour of the winners met him at every corner, and drove\nhim into the outskirts for the object of quietness. There he remained\nuntil the beating of paper drums and the sound of exulting voices could\nbe heard no more; but even when he returned lanterns shone in many\ndwellings, for two hundred persons were composing verses, setting forth\ntheir renown and undoubted accomplishments, ready to affix to their\ndoors and send to friends on the next day. Not giving any portion of\nhis mind to this desirable act of behaviour, Ling flung himself upon the\nfloor, and, finding sleep unattainable, plunged himself into profound\nmeditation of a very uninviting order. \"Without doubt,\" he exclaimed,\n\"evil can only arise from evil, and as this person has always\nendeavoured to lead a life in which his devotions have been equally\ndivided between the sacred Emperor, his illustrious parents, and his\nvenerable ancestors, the fault cannot lie with him. Of the excellence of\nhis parents he has full knowledge; regarding the Emperor, it might\nnot be safe to conjecture. It is therefore probable that some of his\nancestors were persons of abandoned manner and inelegant habits, to\nworship whom results in evil rather than good. Otherwise, how could it\nbe that one whose chief delight lies in the passive contemplation of the\nFour Books and the Five Classics, should be selected by destiny to fill\na position calling for great personal courage and an aggressive nature?\nAssuredly it can only end in a mean and insignificant death, perhaps not\neven followed by burial.\"\n\nIn this manner of thought he fell asleep, and after certain very base\nand impressive dreams, from which good omens were altogether absent, he\nawoke, and rose to begin his preparations for leaving the city. After\ntwo days spent chiefly in obtaining certain safeguards against treachery\nand the bullets of foemen, purchasing opium and other gifts with\nwhich to propitiate the soldiers under his charge, and in consulting\nwell-disposed witches and readers of the future, he set out, and by\ntravelling in extreme discomfort, reached Si-chow within five days.\nDuring his journey he learned that the entire Province was engaged in\nsecret rebellion, several towns, indeed, having declared against\nthe Imperial army without reserve. Those persons to whom Ling spoke\ndescribed the rebels, with respectful admiration, as fierce and\nunnaturally skilful in all methods of fighting, revengeful and merciless\ntowards their enemies, very numerous and above the ordinary height of\nhuman beings, and endowed with qualities which made their skin capable\nof turning aside every kind of weapon. Furthermore, he was assured that\na large band of the most abandoned and best trained was at that moment\nin the immediate neighbourhood of Si-chow.\n\nLing was not destined long to remain in any doubt concerning the truth\nof these matters, for as he made his way through a dark cypress wood,\na few li from the houses of Si-chow, the sounds of a confused outcry\nreached his ears, and on stepping aside to a hidden glade some distance\nfrom the path, he beheld a young and elegant maiden of incomparable\nbeauty being carried away by two persons of most repulsive and\nundignified appearance, whose dress and manner clearly betrayed them to\nbe rebels of the lowest and worst-paid type. At this sight Ling became\npossessed of feelings of a savage yet agreeable order, which until\nthat time he had not conjectured to have any place within his mind, and\nwithout even pausing to consider whether the planets were in favourable\npositions for the enterprise to be undertaken at that time, he drew his\nsword, and ran forward with loud cries. Unsettled in their intentions\nat this unexpected action, the two persons turned and advanced upon Ling\nwith whirling daggers, discussing among themselves whether it would be\nbetter to kill him at the first blow or to take him alive, and, when\nthe day had become sufficiently cool for the full enjoyment of the\nspectacle, submit him to various objectionable tortures of so degraded a\nnature that they were rarely used in the army of the Emperor except upon\nthe persons of barbarians. Observing that the maiden was not bound, Ling\ncried out to her to escape and seek protection within the town, adding,\nwith a magnanimous absence of vanity:\n\n\"Should this person chance to fall, the repose which the presence of\nso lovely and graceful a being would undoubtedly bring to his departing\nspirit would be out-balanced by the unendurable thought that his\ncommonplace efforts had not been sufficient to save her from the two\nevilly-disposed individuals who are, as he perceives, at this moment,\nneglecting no means within their power to accomplish his destruction.\"\nAccepting the discernment of these words, the maiden fled, first\nbestowing a look upon Ling which clearly indicated an honourable regard\nfor himself, a high-minded desire that the affair might end profitably\non his account, and an amiable hope that they should meet again, when\nthese subjects could be expressed more clearly between them.\n\nIn the meantime Ling had become at a disadvantage, for the time occupied\nin speaking and in making the necessary number of bows in reply to\nher entrancing glance had given the other persons an opportunity\nof arranging their charms and sacred written sentences to greater\nadvantage, and of occupying the most favourable ground for the\nencounter. Nevertheless, so great was the force of the new emotion which\nhad entered into Ling's nature that, without waiting to consider the\ndangers or the best method of attack, he rushed upon them, waving his\nsword with such force that he appeared as though surrounded by a circle\nof very brilliant fire. In this way he reached the rebels, who both fell\nunexpectedly at one blow, they, indeed, being under the impression that\nthe encounter had not commenced in reality, and that Ling was merely\nmenacing them in order to inspire their minds with terror and raise his\nown spirits. However much he regretted this act of the incident which\nhe had been compelled to take, Ling could not avoid being filled with\nintellectual joy at finding that his own charms and omens were more\ndistinguished than those possessed by the rebels, none of whom, as he\nnow plainly understood, he need fear.\n\nExamining these things within his mind, and reflecting on the events\nof the past few days, by which he had been thrown into a class of\ncircumstances greatly differing from anything which he had ever sought,\nLing continued his journey, and soon found himself before the southern\ngate of Si-chow. Entering the town, he at once formed the resolution of\ngoing before the Mandarin for Warlike Deeds and Arrangements, so that he\nmight present, without delay, the papers and seals which he had brought\nwith him from Canton.\n\n\"The noble Mandarin Li Keen?\" replied the first person to whom Ling\naddressed himself. \"It would indeed be a difficult and hazardous\nconjecture to make concerning his sacred person. By chance he is in the\nstrongest and best-concealed cellar in Si-chow, unless the sumptuous\nattractions of the deepest dry well have induced him to make a short\njourney\"; and, with a look of great unfriendliness at Ling's dress and\nweapons, this person passed on.\n\n\"Doubtless he is fighting single-handed against the armed men by whom\nthe place is surrounded,\" said another; \"or perhaps he is constructing\nan underground road from the Yamen to Peking, so that we may all escape\nwhen the town is taken. All that can be said with certainty is that the\nHeaven-sent and valorous Mandarin has not been seen outside the walls of\nhis well-fortified residence since the trouble arose; but, as you carry\na sword of conspicuous excellence, you will doubtless be welcome.\"\n\nUpon making a third attempt Ling was more successful, for he inquired\nof an aged woman, who had neither a reputation for keen and polished\nsentences to maintain, nor any interest in the acts of the Mandarin\nor of the rebels. From her he learned how to reach the Yamen, and\naccordingly turned his footsteps in that direction. When at length\nhe arrived at the gate, Ling desired his tablets to be carried to the\nMandarin with many expressions of an impressive and engaging nature,\nnor did he neglect to reward the porter. It was therefore with the\nexpression of a misunderstanding mind that he received a reply setting\nforth that Li Keen was unable to receive him. In great doubt he\nprevailed upon the porter, by means of a still larger reward, again to\ncarry in his message, and on this occasion an answer in this detail was\nplaced before him.\n\n\"Li Keen,\" he was informed, \"is indeed awaiting the arrival of one Ling,\na noble and valiant Commander of Bowmen. He is given to understand,\nit is true, that a certain person claiming the same honoured name is\nstanding in somewhat undignified attitudes at the gate, but he is unable\nin any way to make these two individuals meet within his intellect. He\nwould further remind all persons that the refined observances laid down\nby the wise and exalted Board of Rites and Ceremonies have a marked and\nirreproachable significance when the country is in a state of disorder,\nthe town surrounded by rebels, and every breathing-space of time of more\nthan ordinary value.\"\n\nOverpowered with becoming shame at having been connected with so\nunseemly a breach of civility, for which his great haste had in reality\nbeen accountable, Ling hastened back into the town, and spent many hours\nendeavouring to obtain a chair of the requisite colour in which to\nvisit the Mandarin. In this he was unsuccessful, until it was at length\nsuggested to him that an ordinary chair, such as stood for hire in the\nstreets of Si-chow, would be acceptable if covered with blue paper.\nStill in some doubt as to what the nature of his reception would be,\nLing had no choice but to take this course, and accordingly he again\nreached the Yamen in such a manner, carried by two persons whom he had\nobtained for the purpose. While yet hardly at the residence a salute was\nsuddenly fired; all the gates and doors were, without delay, thrown open\nwith embarrassing and hospitable profusion, and the Mandarin himself\npassed out, and would have assisted Ling to step down from his chair\nhad not that person, clearly perceiving that such a course would be\ntoo great an honour, evaded him by an unobtrusive display of versatile\ndexterity. So numerous and profound were the graceful remarks which each\nmade concerning the habits and accomplishments of the other that more\nthan the space of an hour was passed in traversing the small enclosed\nground which led up to the principal door of the Yamen. There an almost\ngreater time was agreeably spent, both Ling and the Mandarin having\ndetermined that the other should enter first. Undoubtedly Ling, who\nwas the more powerful of the two, would have conferred this courteous\ndistinction upon Li Keen had not that person summoned to his side\ncertain attendants who succeeded in frustrating Ling in his high-minded\nintentions, and in forcing him through the doorway in spite of his\nconscientious protests against the unsurmountable obligation under which\nthe circumstance placed him.\n\nConversing in this intellectual and dignified manner, the strokes of\nthe gong passed unheeded; tea had been brought into their presence many\ntimes, and night had fallen before the Mandarin allowed Ling to refer\nto the matter which had brought him to the place, and to present his\nwritten papers and seals.\n\n\"It is a valuable privilege to have so intelligent a person as the\nillustrious Ling occupying this position,\" remarked the Mandarin, as he\nreturned the papers; \"and not less so on account of the one who\npreceded him proving himself to be a person of feeble attainments and an\nunendurable deficiency of resource.\"\n\n\"To one with the all-knowing Li Keen's mental acquisitions, such a\nperson must indeed have become excessively offensive,\" replied Ling\ndelicately; \"for, as it is truly said, 'Although there exist many\nthousand subjects for elegant conversation, there are persons who cannot\nmeet a cripple without talking about feet.'\"\n\n\"He to whom I have referred was such a one,\" said Li Keen, appreciating\nwith an expression of countenance the fitness of Ling's proverb. \"He was\ntotally inadequate to the requirements of his position; for he possessed\nno military knowledge, and was placed in command by those at Peking as\na result of his taking a high place at one of the examinations. But more\nthan this, although his three years of service were almost completed,\nI was quite unsuccessful in convincing him that an unseemly degradation\nprobably awaited him unless he could furnish me with the means with\nwhich to propitiate the persons in authority at Peking. This he\nneglected to do with obstinate pertinacity, which compelled this person\nto inquire within himself whether one of so little discernment could be\ntrusted with an important and arduous office. After much deliberation,\nthis person came to the decision that the Commander in question was not\na fit person, and he therefore reported him to the Imperial Board\nof Punishment at Peking as one subject to frequent and periodical\neccentricities, and possessed of less than ordinary intellect. In\nconsequence of this act of justice, the Commander was degraded to the\nrank of common bowman, and compelled to pay a heavy fine in addition.\"\n\n\"It was a just and enlightened conclusion of the affair,\" said Ling, in\nspite of a deep feeling of no enthusiasm, \"and one which surprisingly\nbore out your own prophecy in the matter.\"\n\n\"It was an inspired warning to persons who should chance to be in a like\nposition at any time,\" replied Li Keen. \"So grasping and corrupt are\nthose who control affairs in Peking that I have no doubt they would\nscarcely hesitate in debasing even one so immaculate as the exceptional\nLing, and placing him in some laborious and ill-paid civil department\nshould he not accede to their extortionate demands.\"\n\nThis suggestion did not carry with it the unpleasurable emotions which\nthe Mandarin anticipated it would. The fierce instincts which had been\naroused within Ling by the incident in the cypress wood had died out,\nwhile his lamentable ignorance of military affairs was ever before his\nmind. These circumstances, together with his naturally gentle habits,\nmade him regard such a degradation rather favourably than otherwise.\nHe was meditating within himself whether he could arrange such a course\nwithout delay when the Mandarin continued:\n\n\"That, however, is a possibility which is remote to the extent of at\nleast two or three years; do not, therefore, let so unpleasing a thought\ncast darkness upon your brows or remove the unparalleled splendour of\nso refined an occasion... Doubtless the accomplished Ling is a master of\nthe art of chess-play, for many of our most thoughtful philosophers have\ndeclared war to be nothing but such a game; let this slow-witted and\ncumbersome person have an opportunity, therefore, of polishing his\ndeclining facilities by a pleasant and dignified encounter.\"\n\n\n\nV\n\nOn the next day, having completed his business at the Yamen, Ling left\nthe town, and without desiring any ceremony quietly betook himself to\nhis new residence within the camp, which was situated among the millet\nfields some distance from Si-chow. As soon as his presence became known\nall those who occupied positions of command, and whose years of service\nwould shortly come to an end, hastened to present themselves before\nhim, bringing with them offerings according to the rank they held, they\nthemselves requiring a similar service from those beneath them. First\namong these, and next in command to Ling himself, was the Chief of\nBowmen, a person whom Ling observed with extreme satisfaction to be very\npowerful in body and possessing a strong and dignified countenance\nwhich showed unquestionable resolution and shone with a tiger-like\ntenaciousness of purpose.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" thought Ling, as he observed this noble and prepossessing\nperson, \"here is one who will be able to assist me in whatever\nperplexities may arise. Never was there an individual who seemed more\nworthy to command and lead; assuredly to him the most intricate and\nprolonged military positions will be an enjoyment; the most crafty\nstratagems of the enemy as the full moon rising from behind a screen\nof rushes. Without making any pretence of knowledge, this person will\nexplain the facts of the case to him and place himself without limit in\nhis hands.\"\n\nFor this purpose he therefore detained the Chief of Bowmen when the\nothers departed, and complimented him, with many expressive phrases, on\nthe excellence of his appearance, as the thought occurred to him that\nby this means, without disclosing the full measure of his ignorance, the\nperson in question might be encouraged to speak unrestrainedly of the\nnature of his exploits, and perchance thereby explain the use of the\nappliances employed and the meaning of the various words of order,\nin all of which details the Commander was as yet most disagreeably\nimperfect. In this, however, he was disappointed, for the Chief of\nBowmen, greatly to Ling's surprise, received all his polished sentences\nwith somewhat foolish smiles of great self-satisfaction, merely replying\nfrom time to time as he displayed his pigtail to greater advantage or\nrearranged his gold-embroidered cloak:\n\n\"This person must really pray you to desist; the honour is indeed too\ngreat.\"\n\nDisappointed in his hope, and not desiring after this circumstance to\nexpose his shortcomings to one who was obviously not of a highly-refined\nunderstanding, no matter how great his valour in war or his knowledge of\nmilitary affairs might be, Ling endeavoured to lead him to converse of\nthe bowmen under his charge. In this matter he was more successful, for\nthe Chief spoke at great length and with evilly-inspired contempt of\ntheir inelegance, their undiscriminating and excessive appetites, and\nthe frequent use which they made of low words and gestures. Desiring to\nbecome acquainted rather with their methods of warfare than with their\ndomestic details, Ling inquired of him what formation they relied upon\nwhen receiving the foemen.\n\n\"It is a matter which has not engaged the attention of this one,\"\nreplied the Chief, with an excessive absence of interest. \"There are so\nmany affairs of intelligent dignity which cannot be put aside, and\nwhich occupy one from beginning to end. As an example, this person may\ndescribe how the accomplished Li-Lu, generally depicted as the Blue-eyed\nDove of Virtuous and Serpent-like Attitudes, has been scattering glory\nupon the Si-chow Hall of Celestial Harmony for many days past. It is\nan enlightened display which the high-souled Ling should certainly\nendeavour to dignify with his presence, especially at the portion\nwhere the amiable Li-Lu becomes revealed in the appearance of a Peking\nsedan-chair bearer and describes the manner and likenesses of certain\npersons--chiefly high-priests of Buddha, excessively round-bodied\nmerchants who feign to be detained within Peking on affairs of commerce,\nmaidens who attend at the tables of tea-houses, and those of both sexes\nwho are within the city for the first time to behold its temples and\nopen spaces--who are conveyed from place to place in the chair.\"\n\n\"And the bowmen?\" suggested Ling, with difficulty restraining an\nundignified emotion.\n\n\"Really, the elegant Ling will discover them to be persons of deficient\nmanners, and quite unworthy of occupying his well-bred conversation,\"\nreplied the Chief. \"As regards their methods--if the renowned Ling\ninsists--they fight by means of their bows, with which they discharge\narrows at the foemen, they themselves hiding behind trees and rocks.\nShould the enemy be undisconcerted by the cloud of arrows, and advance,\nthe bowmen are instructed to make a last endeavour to frighten them back\nby uttering loud shouts and feigning the voices of savage beasts of the\nforest and deadly snakes.\"\n\n\"And beyond that?\" inquired Ling.\n\n\"Beyond that there are no instructions,\" replied the Chief. \"The\nbowmen would then naturally take to flight, or, if such a course became\nimpossible, run to meet the enemy, protesting that they were convinced\nof the justice of their cause, and were determined to fight on their\nside in the future.\"\n\n\"Would it not be of advantage to arm them with cutting weapons also?\"\ninquired Ling; \"so that when all their arrows were discharged they would\nstill be able to take part in the fight, and not be lost to us?\"\n\n\"They would not be lost to us, of course,\" replied the Chief, \"as we\nwould still be with them. But such a course as the one you suggest could\nnot fail to end in dismay. Being as well armed as ourselves, they\nwould then turn upon us, and, having destroyed us, proceed to establish\nleaders of their own.\"\n\nAs Ling and the Chief of Bowmen conversed in this enlightened manner,\nthere arose a great outcry from among the tents, and presently there\nentered to them a spy who had discovered a strong force of the enemy not\nmore than ten or twelve li away, who showed every indication of marching\nshortly in the direction of Si-chow. In numbers alone, he continued,\nthey were greatly superior to the bowmen, and all were well armed. The\nspreading of this news threw the entire camp into great confusion, many\nprotesting that the day was not a favourable one on which to fight,\nothers crying that it was their duty to fall back on Si-chow and protect\nthe women and children. In the midst of this tumult the Chief of Bowmen\nreturned to Ling, bearing in his hand a written paper which he regarded\nin uncontrollable anguish.\n\n\"Oh, illustrious Ling,\" he cried, restraining his grief with difficulty,\nand leaning for support upon the shoulders of two bowmen, \"how\nprosperous indeed are you! What greater misfortune can engulf a person\nwho is both an ambitious soldier and an affectionate son, than to lose\nsuch a chance of glory and promotion as only occurs once within the\nlifetime, and an affectionate and venerable father upon the same day?\nBehold this mandate to attend, without a moment's delay, at the funeral\nobsequies of one whom I left, only last week, in the fullness of health\nand power. The occasion being an unsuitable one, I will not call upon\nthe courteous Ling to join me in sorrow; but his own devout filial piety\nis so well known that I can conscientiously rely upon an application for\nabsence to be only a matter of official ceremony.\"\n\n\"The application will certainly be regarded as merely official\nceremony,\" replied Ling, without resorting to any delicate pretence of\nmeaning, \"and the refined scruples of the person who is addressing me\nwill be fully met by the official date of his venerated father's\ndeath being fixed for a more convenient season. In the meantime, the\nunobtrusive Chief of Bowmen may take the opportunity of requesting that\nthe family tomb be kept unsealed until he is heard from again.\"\n\nLing turned away, as he finished this remark, with a dignified feeling\nof not inelegant resentment. In this way he chanced to observe a large\nbody of soldiers which was leaving the camp accompanied by their lesser\ncaptains, all crowned with garlands of flowers and creeping plants. In\nspite of his very inadequate attainments regarding words of order, the\nCommander made it understood by means of an exceedingly short sentence\nthat he was desirous of the men returning without delay.\n\n\"Doubtless the accomplished Commander, being but newly arrived in this\nneighbourhood, is unacquainted with the significance of this display,\"\nsaid one of the lesser captains pleasantly. \"Know then, O wise and\ncustom-respecting Ling, that on a similar day many years ago this\nvaliant band of bowmen was engaged in a very honourable affair with\ncertain of the enemy. Since then it has been the practice to commemorate\nthe matter with music and other forms of delight within the large square\nat Si-chow.\"\n\n\"Such customs are excellent,\" said Ling affably. \"On this occasion,\nhowever, the public square will be so insufferably thronged with the\nnumber of timorous and credulous villagers who have pressed into the\ntown that insufficient justice would be paid to your entrancing display.\nIn consequence of this, we will select for the purpose some convenient\nspot in the neighbourhood. The proceedings will be commenced by a\ndisplay of arrow-shooting at moving objects, followed by racing and\ndancing, in which this person will lead. I have spoken.\"\n\nAt these words many of the more courageous among the bowmen became\ndestructively inspired, and raised shouts of defiance against the enemy,\nenumerating at great length the indignities which they would heap upon\ntheir prisoners. Cries of distinction were also given on behalf of Ling,\neven the more terrified exclaiming:\n\n\"The noble Commander Ling will lead us! He has promised, and assuredly\nhe will not depart from his word. Shielded by his broad and sacred body,\nfrom which the bullets glance aside harmlessly, we will advance upon the\nenemy in the stealthy manner affected by ducks when crossing the swamp.\nHow altogether superior a person our Commander is when likened unto the\nleaders of the foemen--they who go into battle completely surrounded by\ntheir archers!\"\n\nUpon this, perceiving the clear direction in which matters were turning,\nthe Chief of Bowmen again approached Ling.\n\n\"Doubtless the highly-favoured person whom I am now addressing has been\nendowed with exceptional authority direct from Peking,\" he remarked with\ninsidious politeness. \"Otherwise this narrow-minded individual would\nsuggest that such a decision does not come within the judgment of a\nCommander.\"\n\nIn his ignorance of military matters it had not entered the mind of\nLing that his authority did not give him the power to commence an\nattack without consulting other and more distinguished persons. At the\nsuggestion, which he accepted as being composed of truth, he paused, the\nenlightened zeal with which he had been inspired dying out as he plainly\nunderstood the difficulties by which he was enclosed. There seemed a\nsingle expedient path for him in the matter; so, directing a person\nof exceptional trustworthiness to prepare himself for a journey, he\ninscribed a communication to the Mandarin Li Keen, in which he narrated\nthe facts and asked for speedy directions, and then despatched it with\ngreat urgency to Si-chow.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nWhen these matters were arranged, Ling returned to his tent, a victim\nto feelings of a deep and confused doubt, for all courses seemed to\nbe surrounded by extreme danger, with the strong possibility of final\ndisaster. While he was considering these things attentively, the spy who\nhad brought word of the presence of the enemy again sought him. As he\nentered, Ling perceived that his face was the colour of a bleached linen\ngarment, while there came with him the odour of sickness.\n\n\"There are certain matters which this person has not made known,\" he\nsaid, having first expressed a request that he might not be compelled to\nstand while he conversed. \"The bowmen are as an inferior kind of jackal,\nand they who lead them are pigs, but this person has observed that the\nHeaven-sent Commander has internal organs like steel hardened in a white\nfire and polished by running water. For this reason he will narrate\nto him the things he has seen--things at which the lesser ones would\nundoubtedly perish in terror without offering to strike a blow.\"\n\n\"Speak,\" said Ling, \"without fear and without concealment.\"\n\n\"In numbers the rebels are as three to one with the bowmen, and are,\nin addition, armed with matchlocks and other weapons; this much I have\nalready told,\" said the spy. \"Yesterday they entered the village of Ki\nwithout resistance, as the dwellers there were all peaceable persons,\nwho gain a living from the fields, and who neither understood nor\ntroubled about the matters between the rebels and the army. Relying on\nthe promises made by the rebel chiefs, the villagers even welcomed them,\nas they had been assured that they came as buyers of their corn and\nrice. To-day not a house stands in the street of Ki, not a person lives.\nThe men they slew quickly, or held for torture, as they desired at the\nmoment; the boys they hung from the trees as marks for their arrows.\nOf the women and children this person, who has since been subject to\nseveral attacks of fainting and vomiting, desires not to speak. The\nwells of Ki are filled with the bodies of such as had the good fortune\nto be warned in time to slay themselves. The cattle drag themselves from\nplace to place on their forefeet; the fish in the Heng-Kiang are dying,\nfor they cannot live on water thickened into blood. All these things\nthis person has seen.\"\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, Ling remained in deep and funereal\nthought for some time. In spite of his mild nature, the words which\nhe had heard filled him with an inextinguishable desire to slay in\nhand-to-hand fighting. He regretted that he had placed the decision of\nthe matter before Li Keen.\n\n\"If only this person had a mere handful of brave and expert warriors, he\nwould not hesitate to fall upon those savage and barbarous characters,\nand either destroy them to the last one, or let his band suffer a like\nfate,\" he murmured to himself.\n\nThe return of the messenger found him engaged in reviewing the bowmen,\nand still in this mood, so that it was with a commendable feeling of\nsatisfaction, no less than virtuous contempt, that he learned of the\nMandarin's journey to Peking as soon as he understood that the rebels\nwere certainly in the neighbourhood.\n\n\"The wise and ornamental Li Keen is undoubtedly consistent in all\nmatters,\" said Ling, with some refined bitterness. \"The only information\nregarding his duties to which this person obtained from him chanced\nto be a likening of war to skilful chess-play, and to this end the\naccomplished person in question has merely availed himself of a common\nexpedient which places him at the remote side of the divine Emperor.\nYet this act is not unwelcome, for the responsibility of deciding what\ncourse is to be adopted now clearly rests with this person. He is, as\nthose who are standing by may perceive, of under the usual height, and\nof no particular mental or bodily attainments. But he has eaten the rice\nof the Emperor, and wears the Imperial sign embroidered upon his arm.\nBefore him are encamped the enemies of his master and of his land, and\nin no way will he turn his back upon them. Against brave and skilful\nmen, such as those whom this person commands, rebels of a low and\ndegraded order are powerless, and are, moreover, openly forbidden to\nsucceed by the Forty-second Mandate in the Sacred Book of Arguments.\nShould it have happened that into this assembly any person of a\nperfidious or uncourageous nature has gained entrance by guile, and has\nnot been detected and driven forth by his outraged companions (as would\ncertainly occur if such a person were discovered), I, Ling, Commander\nof Bowmen, make an especial and well-considered request that he shall be\nstruck by a molten thunderbolt if he turns to flight or holds thoughts\nof treachery.\"\n\nHaving thus addressed and encouraged the soldiers, Ling instructed them\nthat each one should cut and fashion for himself a graceful but weighty\nclub from among the branches of the trees around, and then return to the\ntents for the purpose of receiving food and rice spirit.\n\nWhen noon was passed, allowing such time as would enable him to reach\nthe camp of the enemy an hour before darkness, Ling arranged the bowmen\nin companies of convenient numbers, and commenced the march, sending\nforward spies, who were to work silently and bring back tidings from\nevery point. In this way he penetrated to within a single li of the\nruins of Ki, being informed by the spies that no outposts of the enemy\nwere between him and that place. Here the first rest was made to\nenable the more accurate and bold spies to reach them with trustworthy\ninformation regarding the position and movements of the camp. With\nlittle delay there returned the one who had brought the earliest\ntidings, bruised and torn with his successful haste through the forest,\nbut wearing a complacent and well-satisfied expression of countenance.\nWithout hesitation or waiting to demand money before he would reveal his\nknowledge, he at once disclosed that the greater part of the enemy were\nrejoicing among the ruins of Ki, they having discovered there a quantity\nof opium and a variety of liquids, while only a small guard remained in\nthe camp with their weapons ready. At these words Ling sprang from\nthe ground in gladness, so great was his certainty of destroying the\ninvaders utterly. It was, however, with less pleasurable emotions that\nhe considered how he should effect the matter, for it was in no way\nadvisable to divide his numbers into two bands. Without any feeling of\nunendurable conceit, he understood that no one but himself could hold\nthe bowmen before an assault, however weak. In a similar manner, he\ndetermined that it would be more advisable to attack those in the\nvillage first. These he might have reasonable hopes of cutting down\nwithout warning the camp, or, in any event, before those from the camp\narrived. To assail the camp first would assuredly, by the firing, draw\nupon them those from the village, and in whatever evil state these might\narrive, they would, by their numbers, terrify the bowmen, who without\ndoubt would have suffered some loss from the matchlocks.\n\nWaiting for the last light of day, Ling led on the men again, and\nsending forward some of the most reliable, surrounded the place of the\nvillage silently and without detection. In the open space, among broken\ncasks and other inconsiderable matters, plainly shown by the large fires\nat which burned the last remains of the houses of Ki, many men moved\nor lay, some already dull or in heavy sleep. As the darkness dropped\nsuddenly, the signal of a peacock's shriek, three times uttered, rang\nforth, and immediately a cloud of arrows, directed from all sides,\npoured in among those who feasted. Seeing their foemen defenceless\nbefore them, the archers neglected the orders they had received, and\nthrowing away their bows they rushed in with uplifted clubs, uttering\nloud shouts of triumph. The next moment a shot was fired in the wood,\ndrums beat, and in an unbelievably short space of time a small but\nwell-armed band of the enemy was among them. Now that all need of\ncaution was at an end, Ling rushed forward with raised sword, calling\nto his men that victory was certainly theirs, and dealing discriminating\nand inspiriting blows whenever he met a foeman. Three times he formed\nthe bowmen into a figure emblematic of triumph, and led them against the\nline of matchlocks. Twice they fell back, leaving mingled dead under\nthe feet of the enemy. The third time they stood firm, and Ling threw\nhimself against the waving rank in a noble and inspired endeavour to\nlead the way through. At that moment, when a very distinguished victory\nseemed within his hand, his elegant and well-constructed sword broke\nupon an iron shield, leaving him defenceless and surrounded by the\nenemy.\n\n\"Chief among the sublime virtues enjoined by the divine Confucius,\"\nbegan Ling, folding his arms and speaking in an unmoved voice, \"is an\nintelligent submission--\" but at that word he fell beneath a rain of\nheavy and unquestionably well-aimed blows.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nBetween Si-chow and the village of Ki, in a house completely hidden from\ntravellers by the tall and black trees which surrounded it, lived an\naged and very wise person whose ways and manner of living had become so\ndistasteful to his neighbours that they at length agreed to regard him\nas a powerful and ill-disposed magician. In this way it became a custom\nthat all very unseemly deeds committed by those who, in the ordinary\ncourse, would not be guilty of such behaviour, should be attributed\nto his influence, so that justice might be effected without persons of\nassured respectability being put to any inconvenience. Apart from the\nfeeling which resulted from this just decision, the uncongenial person\nin question had become exceedingly unpopular on account of certain\ndefinite actions of his own, as that of causing the greater part of\nSi-chow to be burned down by secretly breathing upon the seven sacred\nwater-jugs to which the town owed its prosperity and freedom from fire.\nFurthermore, although possessed of many taels, and able to afford such\nfood as is to be found upon the tables of Mandarins, he selected from\nchoice dishes of an objectionable nature; he had been observed to eat\neggs of unbecoming freshness, and the Si-chow Official Printed Leaf made\nit public that he had, on an excessively hot occasion, openly partaken\nof cow's milk. It is not a matter for wonder, therefore, that when\nunnaturally loud thunder was heard in the neighbourhood of Si-chow\nthe more ignorant and credulous persons refused to continue in any\ndescription of work until certain ceremonies connected with rice spirit,\nand the adherence to a reclining position for some hours, had been\nconscientiously observed as a protection against evil.\n\nNot even the most venerable person in Si-chow could remember the time\nwhen the magician had not lived there, and as there existed no written\nrecord narrating the incident, it was with well-founded probability\nthat he was said to be incapable of death. Contrary to the most general\npractice, although quite unmarried, he had adopted no son to found a\nline which would worship his memory in future years, but had instead\nbrought up and caused to be educated in the most difficult varieties\nof embroidery a young girl, to whom he referred, for want of a more\nsuitable description, as the daughter of his sister, although he would\nadmit without hesitation, when closely questioned, that he had never\npossessed a sister, at the same time, however, alluding with some\npride to many illustrious brothers, who had all obtained distinction in\nvarious employments.\n\nFew persons of any high position penetrated into the house of the\nmagician, and most of these retired with inelegant haste on perceiving\nthat no domestic altar embellished the great hall. Indeed, not to make\nconcealment of the fact, the magician was a person who had entirely\nneglected the higher virtues in an avaricious pursuit of wealth. In that\nway all his time and a very large number of taels had been expended,\ntesting results by means of the four elements, and putting together\nthings which had been inadequately arrived at by others. It was\nconfidently asserted in Si-chow that he possessed every manner of\nprinted leaf which had been composed in whatsoever language, and all the\nmost precious charms, including many snake-skins of more than ordinary\nrarity, and the fang of a black wolf which had been stung by seven\nscorpions.\n\nOn the death of his father the magician had become possessed of great\nwealth, yet he contributed little to the funeral obsequies nor did any\nsuggestion of a durable and expensive nature conveying his enlightened\nname and virtues down to future times cause his face to become\ngladdened. In order to preserve greater secrecy about the enchantments\nwhich he certainly performed, he employed only two persons within the\nhouse, one of whom was blind and the other deaf. In this ingenious\nmanner he hoped to receive attention and yet be unobserved, the\nblind one being unable to see the nature of the incantations which he\nundertook, and the deaf one being unable to hear the words. In this,\nhowever, he was unsuccessful, as the two persons always contrived to\nbe present together, and to explain to one another the nature of the\nvarious matters afterwards; but as they were of somewhat deficient\nunderstanding, the circumstance was unimportant.\n\nIt was with more uneasiness that the magician perceived one day that the\nmaiden whom he had adopted was no longer a child. As he desired secrecy\nabove all things until he should have completed the one important\nmatter for which he had laboured all his life, he decided with extreme\nunwillingness to put into operation a powerful charm towards her, which\nwould have the effect of diminishing all her attributes until such time\nas he might release her again. Owing to his reluctance in the matter,\nhowever, the magic did not act fully, but only in such a way that her\nfeet became naturally and without binding the most perfect and beautiful\nin the entire province of Hu Nan, so that ever afterwards she was called\nPan Fei Mian, in delicate reference to that Empress whose feet were so\nsymmetrical that a golden lily sprang up wherever she trod. Afterwards\nthe magician made no further essay in the matter, chiefly because he\nwas ever convinced that the accomplishment of his desire was within his\ngrasp.\n\nThe rumours of armed men in the neighbourhood of Si-chow threw the\nmagician into an unendurable condition of despair. To lose all, as would\nmost assuredly happen if he had to leave his arranged rooms and secret\npreparations and take to flight, was the more bitter because he felt\nsurer than ever that success was even standing by his side. The very\nsubtle liquid, which would mix itself into the component parts of the\nliving creature which drank it, and by an insidious and harmless process\nso work that, when the spirit departed, the flesh would become resolved\ninto a figure of pure and solid gold of the finest quality, had engaged\nthe refined minds of many of the most expert individuals of remote\nages. With most of these inspired persons, however, the search had\nbeen undertaken in pure-minded benevolence, their chief aim being an\nhonourable desire to discover a method by which one's ancestors might\nbe permanently and effectively preserved in a fit and becoming manner to\nreceive the worship and veneration of posterity. Yet, in spite of these\namiable motives, and of the fact that the magician merely desired the\npossession of the secret to enable him to become excessively wealthy,\nthe affair had been so arranged that it should come into his possession.\n\nThe matter which concerned Mian in the dark wood, when she was only\nsaved by the appearance of the person who is already known as Ling,\nentirely removed all pleasurable emotions from the magician's mind, and\non many occasions he stated in a definite and systematic manner that he\nwould shortly end an ignoble career which seemed to be destined only\nto gloom and disappointment. In this way an important misunderstanding\narose, for when, two days later, during the sound of matchlock\nfiring, the magician suddenly approached the presence of Mian with an\nuncontrollable haste and an entire absence of dignified demeanour,\nand fell dead at her feet without expressing himself on any subject\nwhatever, she deliberately judged that in this manner he had carried his\nremark into effect, nor did the closed vessel of yellow liquid which he\nheld in his hand seem to lead away from this decision. In reality, the\nmagician had fallen owing to the heavy and conflicting emotions which\nsuccess had engendered in an intellect already greatly weakened by\nhis continual disregard of the higher virtues; for the bottle, indeed,\ncontained the perfection of his entire life's study, the very expensive\nand three-times purified gold liquid.\n\nOn perceiving the magician's condition, Mian at once called for the two\nattendants, and directed them to bring from an inner chamber all the\nmost effective curing substances, whether in the form of powder or\nliquid. When these proved useless, no matter in what way they were\napplied, it became evident that there could be very little hope of\nrestoring the magician, yet so courageous and grateful for the benefits\nwhich she had received from the person in question was Mian, that, in\nspite of the uninviting dangers of the enterprise, she determined to\njourney to Ki to invoke the assistance of a certain person who was known\nto be very successful in casting out malicious demons from the bodies\nof animals, and from casks and barrels, in which they frequently took\nrefuge, to the great detriment of the quality of the liquid placed\ntherein.\n\nNot without many hidden fears, Mian set out on her journey, greatly\ndesiring not to be subjected to an encounter of a nature similar to the\none already recorded; for in such a case she could hardly again hope for\nthe inspired arrival of the one whom she now often thought of in secret\nas the well-formed and symmetrical young sword-user. Nevertheless, an\nevent of equal significance was destined to prove the wisdom of\nthe well-known remark concerning thoughts which are occupying one's\nintellect and the unexpected appearance of a very formidable evil\nspirit; for as she passed along, quickly yet with so dignified a motion\nthat the moss received no impression beneath her footsteps, she became\naware of a circumstance which caused her to stop by imparting to her\nmind two definite and greatly dissimilar emotions.\n\nIn a grassy and open space, on the verge of which she stood, lay\nthe dead bodies of seventeen rebels, all disposed in very degraded\nattitudes, which contrasted strongly with the easy and becoming position\nadopted by the eighteenth--one who bore the unmistakable emblems of the\nImperial army. In this brave and noble-looking personage Mian at once\nsaw her preserver, and not doubting that an inopportune and treacherous\ndeath had overtaken him, she ran forward and raised him in her arms,\nbeing well assured that however indiscreet such an action might appear\nin the case of an ordinary person, the most select maiden need not\nhesitate to perform so honourable a service in regard to one whose\nvirtues had by that time undoubtedly placed him among the Three Thousand\nPure Ones. Being disturbed in this providential manner, Ling opened his\neyes, and faintly murmuring, \"Oh, sainted and adorable Koon Yam, Goddess\nof Charity, intercede for me with Buddha!\" he again lost possession of\nhimself in the Middle Air. At this remark, which plainly proved Ling to\nbe still alive, in spite of the fact that both the maiden and the person\nhimself had thoughts to the contrary, Mian found herself surrounded by\na variety of embarrassing circumstances, among which occurred a\nremembrance of the dead magician and the wise person at Ki whom she had\nset out to summon; but on considering the various natural and sublime\nlaws which bore directly on the alternative before her, she discovered\nthat her plain destiny was to endeavour to restore the breath in the\nperson who was still alive rather than engage on the very unsatisfactory\nchance of attempting to call it back to the body from which it had so\nlong been absent.\n\nHaving been inspired to this conclusion--which, when she later examined\nher mind, she found not to be repulsive to her own inner feelings--Mian\nreturned to the house with dexterous speed, and calling together the two\nattendants, she endeavoured by means of signs and drawings to explain to\nthem what she desired to accomplish. Succeeding in this after some delay\n(for the persons in question, being very illiterate and narrow-minded,\nwere unable at first to understand the existence of any recumbent male\nperson other than the dead magician, whom they thereupon commenced to\nbury in the garden with expressions of great satisfaction at their\nown intelligence in comprehending Mian's meaning so readily) they all\njourneyed to the wood, and bearing Ling between them, they carried him\nto the house without further adventure.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nIt was in the month of Hot Dragon Breaths, many weeks after the fight in\nthe woods of Ki, that Ling again opened his eyes to find himself in an\nunknown chamber, and to recognize in the one who visited him from time\nto time the incomparable maiden whose life he had saved in the cypress\nglade. Not a day had passed in the meanwhile on which Mian had neglected\nto offer sacrifices to Chang-Chung, the deity interested in drugs and\nhealing substances, nor had she wavered in her firm resolve to bring\nLing back to an ordinary existence even when the attendants had\nprotested that the person in question might without impropriety be sent\nto the Restoring Establishment of the Last Chance, so little did his\nhope of recovering rest upon the efforts of living beings.\n\nAfter he had beheld Mian's face and understood the circumstances of his\nescape and recovery, Ling quickly shook off the evil vapours which had\nheld him down so long, and presently he was able to walk slowly in the\ncourtyard and in the shady paths of the wood beyond, leaning upon Mian\nfor the support he still required.\n\n\"Oh, graceful one,\" he said on such an occasion, when little stood\nbetween him and the full powers which he had known before the battle,\n\"there is a matter which has been pressing upon this person's mind for\nsome time past. It is as dark after light to let the thoughts dwell\naround it, yet the thing itself must inevitably soon be regarded, for in\nthis life one's actions are for ever regulated by conditions which are\nneither of one's own seeking nor within one's power of controlling.\"\n\nAt these words all brightness left Mian's manner, for she at once\nunderstood that Ling referred to his departure, of which she herself had\nlately come to think with unrestrained agitation.\n\n\"Oh, Ling,\" she exclaimed at length, \"most expert of sword-users and\nmost noble of men, surely never was a maiden more inelegantly placed\nthan the one who is now by your side. To you she owes her life, yet it\nis unseemly for her even to speak of the incident; to you she must\nlook for protection, yet she cannot ask you to stay by her side. She is\nindeed alone. The magician is dead, Ki has fallen, Ling is going, and\nMian is undoubtedly the most unhappy and solitary person between the\nWall and the Nan Hai.\"\n\n\"Beloved Mian,\" exclaimed Ling, with inspiring vehemence, \"and is not\nthe utterly unworthy person before you indebted to you in a double\nmeasure that life is still within him? Is not the strength which now\npromotes him to such exceptional audacity as to aspire to your\nlovely hand, of your own creating? Only encourage Ling to entertain a\nwell-founded hope that on his return he shall not find you partaking\nof the wedding feast of some wealthy and exceptionally round-bodied\nMandarin, and this person will accomplish the journey to Canton and back\nas it were in four strides.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ling, reflexion of my ideal, holder of my soul, it would indeed\nbe very disagreeable to my own feelings to make any reply save one,\"\nreplied Mian, scarcely above a breath-voice. \"Gratitude alone would\ndirect me, were it not that the great love which fills me leaves no\nresting-place for any other emotion than itself. Go if you must,\nbut return quickly, for your absence will weigh upon Mian like a\ndragon-dream.\"\n\n\"Violet light of my eyes,\" exclaimed Ling, \"even in surroundings which\nwith the exception of the matter before us are uninspiring in the\nextreme, your virtuous and retiring encouragement yet raises me to such\na commanding eminence of demonstrative happiness that I fear I\nshall become intolerably self-opinionated towards my fellow-men in\nconsequence.\"\n\n\"Such a thing is impossible with my Ling,\" said Mian, with conviction.\n\"But must you indeed journey to Canton?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" replied Ling, \"gladly would this person decide against such\na course did the matter rest with him, for as the Verses say, 'It\nis needless to apply the ram's head to the unlocked door.' But Ki is\ndemolished, the unassuming Mandarin Li Keen has retired to Peking, and\nof the fortunes of his bowmen this person is entirely ignorant.\"\n\n\"Such as survived returned to their homes,\" replied Mian, \"and Si-chow\nis safe, for the scattered and broken rebels fled to the mountains\nagain; so much this person has learned.\"\n\n\"In that case Si-chow is undoubtedly safe for the time, and can be left\nwith prudence,\" said Ling. \"It is an unfortunate circumstance that there\nis no Mandarin of authority between here and Canton who can receive from\nthis person a statement of past facts and give him instructions for the\nfuture.\"\n\n\"And what will be the nature of such instructions as will be given at\nCanton?\" demanded Mian.\n\n\"By chance they may take the form of raising another company of bowmen,\"\nsaid Ling, with a sigh, \"but, indeed, if this person can obtain any\nweight by means of his past service, they will tend towards a pleasant\nand unambitious civil appointment.\"\n\n\"Oh, my artless and noble-minded lover!\" exclaimed Mian, \"assuredly a\nveil has been before your eyes during your residence in Canton, and your\nnaturally benevolent mind has turned all things into good, or you would\nnot thus hopefully refer to your brilliant exploits in the past. Of what\ncommercial benefit have they been to the sordid and miserly persons\nin authority, or in what way have they diverted a stream of taels into\ntheir insatiable pockets? Far greater is the chance that had Si-chow\nfallen many of its household goods would have found their way into the\nYamens of Canton. Assuredly in Li Keen you will have a friend who will\nmake many delicate allusions to your ancestors when you meet, and yet\none who will float many barbed whispers to follow you when you have\npassed; for you have planted shame before him in the eyes of those who\nwould otherwise neither have eyes to see nor tongues to discuss the\nmatter. It is for such a reason that this person distrusts all things\nconnected with the journey, except your constancy, oh, my true and\nstrong one.\"\n\n\"Such faithfulness would alone be sufficient to assure my safe return if\nthe matter were properly represented to the supreme Deities,\" said Ling.\n\"Let not the thin curtain of bitter water stand before your lustrous\neyes any longer, then, the events which have followed one another in the\npast few days in a fashion that can only be likened to thunder following\nlightning are indeed sufficient to distress one with so refined and\nswan-like an organization, but they are now assuredly at an end.\"\n\n\"It is a hope of daily recurrence to this person,\" replied Mian,\nhonourably endeavouring to restrain the emotion which openly exhibited\nitself in her eyes; \"for what maiden would not rather make successful\nofferings to the Great Mother Kum-Fa than have the most imposing and\nverbose Triumphal Arch erected to commemorate an empty and unsatisfying\nconstancy?\"\n\nIn this amiable manner the matter was arranged between Ling and Mian, as\nthey sat together in the magician's garden drinking peach-tea, which the\ntwo attendants--not without discriminating and significant expressions\nbetween themselves--brought to them from time to time. Here Ling made\nclear the whole manner of his life from his earliest memory to the\ntime when he fell in dignified combat, nor did Mian withhold anything,\nexplaining in particular such charms and spells of the magician as she\nhad knowledge of, and in this graceful manner materially assisting her\nlover in the many disagreeable encounters and conflicts which he was\nshortly to experience.\n\nIt was with even more objectionable feelings than before that Ling now\ncontemplated his journey to Canton, involving as it did the separation\nfrom one who had become as the shadow of his existence, and by whose\nside he had an undoubted claim to stand. Yet the necessity of the\nundertaking was no less than before, and the full possession of all his\nnatural powers took away his only excuse for delaying in the matter.\nWithout any pleasurable anticipations, therefore, he consulted the\nSacred Flat and Round Sticks, and learning that the following day would\nbe propitious for the journey, he arranged to set out in accordance with\nthe omen.\n\nWhen the final moment arrived at which the invisible threads of\nconstantly passing emotions from one to the other must be broken, and\nwhen Mian perceived that her lover's horse was restrained at the door by\nthe two attendants, who with unsuspected delicacy of feeling had taken\nthis opportunity of withdrawing, the noble endurance which had hitherto\nupheld her melted away, and she became involved in very melancholy\nand obscure meditations until she observed that Ling also was quickly\nbecoming affected by a similar gloom.\n\n\"Alas!\" she exclaimed, \"how unworthy a person I am thus to impose upon\nmy lord a greater burden than that which already weighs him down! Rather\nought this one to dwell upon the happiness of that day, when, after\nsuccessfully evading or overthrowing the numerous bands of assassins\nwhich infest the road from here to Canton, and after escaping or\nrecovering from the many deadly pestilences which invariably reduce that\ncity at this season of the year, he shall triumphantly return. Assuredly\nthere is a highly-polished surface united to every action in life,\nno matter how funereal it may at first appear. Indeed, there are many\nincidents compared with which death itself is welcome, and to this end\nMian has reserved a farewell gift.\"\n\nSpeaking in this manner the devoted and magnanimous maiden placed in\nLing's hands the transparent vessel of liquid which the magician had\ngrasped when he fell. \"This person,\" she continued, speaking with\ndifficulty, \"places her lover's welfare incomparably before her own\nhappiness, and should he ever find himself in a situation which is\nunendurably oppressive, and from which death is the only escape--such\nas inevitable tortures, the infliction of violent madness, or the\nsubjection by magic to the will of some designing woman--she begs him\nto accept this means of freeing himself without regarding her anguish\nbeyond expressing a clearly defined last wish that the two persons in\nquestion may be in the end happily reunited in another existence.\"\n\nAssured by this last evidence of affection, Ling felt that he had no\nlonger any reason for internal heaviness; his spirits were immeasurably\nraised by the fragrant incense of Mian's great devotion, and under its\ninfluence he was even able to breathe towards her a few words of similar\ncomfort as he left the spot and began his journey.\n\n\n\nIX\n\nOn entering Canton, which he successfully accomplished without any\nunpleasant adventure, the marked absence of any dignified ostentation\nwhich had been accountable for many of Ling's misfortunes in the past,\nimpelled him again to reside in the same insignificant apartment that\nhe had occupied when he first visited the city as an unknown\nand unimportant candidate. In consequence of this, when Ling was\ncommunicating to any person the signs by which messengers might\nfind him, he was compelled to add, \"the neighbourhood in which this\ncontemptible person resides is that officially known as 'the mean\nquarter favoured by the lower class of those who murder by treachery,'\"\nand for this reason he was not always treated with the regard to which\nhis attainments entitled him, or which he would have unquestionably\nreceived had he been able to describe himself as of \"the partly-drained\nand uninfected area reserved to Mandarins and their friends.\"\n\nIt was with an ignoble feeling of mental distress that Ling exhibited\nhimself at the Chief Office of Warlike Deeds and Arrangements on the\nfollowing day; for the many disadvantageous incidents of his past life\nhad repeated themselves before his eyes while he slept, and the not\nunhopeful emotions which he had felt when in the inspiring presence of\nMian were now altogether absent. In spite of the fact that he reached\nthe office during the early gong strokes of the morning, it was not\nuntil the withdrawal of light that he reached any person who was in a\nposition to speak with him on the matter, so numerous were the lesser\nones through whose chambers he had to pass in the process. At length he\nfound himself in the presence of an upper one who had the appearance\nof being acquainted with the circumstances, and who received him with\ndignity, though not with any embarrassing exhibition of respect or\nservility.\n\n\"'The hero of the illustrious encounter beyond the walls of Si-chow,'\"\nexclaimed that official, reading the words from the tablet of\nintroduction which Ling had caused to be carried into him, and at the\nsame time examining the person in question closely. \"Indeed, no such one\nis known to those within this office, unless the words chance to point\nto the courteous and unassuming Mandarin Li Keen, who, however, is at\nthis moment recovering his health at Peking, as set forth in the amiable\nand impartial report which we have lately received from him.\"\n\nAt these words Ling plainly understood that there was little hope of the\nlast events becoming profitable on his account.\n\n\"Did not the report to which allusion has been made bear reference to\none Ling, Commander of the Archers, who thrice led on the fighting men,\nand who was finally successful in causing the rebels to disperse towards\nthe mountains?\" he asked, in a voice which somewhat trembled.\n\n\"There is certainly reference to one of the name you mention,\" said\nthe other; \"but regarding the terms--perhaps this person would better\nprotect his own estimable time by displaying the report within your\nsight.\"\n\nWith these words the upper one struck a gong several times, and after\nreceiving from an inner chamber the parchment in question, he placed\nit before Ling, at the same time directing a lesser one to interpose\nbetween it and the one who read it a large sheet of transparent\nsubstance, so that destruction might not come to it, no matter in\nwhat way its contents affected the reader. Thereon Ling perceived the\nfollowing facts, very skilfully inscribed with the evident purpose of\ninducing persons to believe, without question, that words so elegantly\ntraced must of necessity be truthful also.\n\n  A Benevolent Example of the Intelligent Arrangement by which the\n  most Worthy Persons outlive those who are Incapable.\n\n  The circumstances connected with the office of the valuable and\n  accomplished Mandarin of Warlike Deeds and Arrangements at Si-chow\n  have, in recent times, been of anything but a prepossessing order.\n  Owing to the very inadequate methods adopted by those who earn a\n  livelihood by conveying necessities from the more enlightened\n  portions of the Empire to that place, it so came about that for a\n  period of five days the Yamen was entirely unsupplied with the\n  fins of sharks or even with goats' eyes. To add to the polished\n  Mandarin's distress of mind the barbarous and slow-witted rebels\n  who infest those parts took this opportunity to destroy the town\n  and most of its inhabitants, the matter coming about as follows:\n\n  The feeble and commonplace person named Ling who commands the\n  bowmen had but recently been elevated to that distinguished\n  position from a menial and degraded occupation (for which, indeed,\n  his stunted intellect more aptly fitted him); and being in\n  consequence very greatly puffed out in self-gratification, he\n  became an easy prey to the cunning of the rebels, and allowed\n  himself to be beguiled into a trap, paying for this contemptible\n  stupidity with his life. The town of Si-chow was then attacked,\n  and being in this manner left defenceless through the weakness--or\n  treachery--of the person Ling, who had contrived to encompass the\n  entire destruction of his unyielding company, it fell after a\n  determined and irreproachable resistance; the Mandarin Li Keen\n  being told, as, covered with the blood of the foemen, he was\n  dragged away from the thickest part of the unequal conflict by his\n  followers, that he was the last person to leave the town. On his\n  way to Peking with news of this valiant defence, the Mandarin was\n  joined by the Chief of Bowmen, who had understood and avoided the\n  very obvious snare into which the stagnant-minded Commander had\n  led his followers, in spite of disinterested advice to the\n  contrary. For this intelligent perception, and for general\n  nobility of conduct when in battle, the versatile Chief of Bowmen\n  is by this written paper strongly recommended to the dignity of\n  receiving the small metal Embellishment of Valour.\n\n  It has been suggested to the Mandarin Li Keen that the bestowal of\n  the Crystal Button would only be a fit and graceful reward for his\n  indefatigable efforts to uphold the dignity of the sublime\n  Emperor; but to all such persons the Mandarin has sternly replied\n  that such a proposal would more fitly originate from the renowned\n  and valuable Office of Warlike Deeds and Arrangements, he well\n  knowing that the wise and engaging persons who conduct that\n  indispensable and well-regulated department are gracefully\n  voracious in their efforts to reward merit, even when it is\n  displayed, as in the case in question, by one who from his\n  position will inevitably soon be urgently petitioning in a like\n  manner on their behalf.\n\nWhen Ling had finished reading this elegantly arranged but exceedingly\nmisleading parchment, he looked up with eyes from which he vainly\nendeavoured to restrain the signs of undignified emotion, and said to\nthe upper one:\n\n\"It is difficult employment for a person to refrain from unendurable\nthoughts when his unassuming and really conscientious efforts are\nrepresented in a spirit of no satisfaction, yet in this matter the very\nexpert Li Keen appears to have gone beyond himself; the Commander Ling,\nwho is herein represented as being slain by the enemy, is, indeed, the\nperson who is standing before you, and all the other statements are in a\nlike exactness.\"\n\n\"The short-sighted individual who for some hidden desire of his own is\nendeavouring to present himself as the corrupt and degraded creature\nLing, has overlooked one important circumstance,\" said the upper one,\nsmiling in a very intolerable manner, at the same time causing his head\nto move slightly from side to side in the fashion of one who rebukes\nwith assumed geniality; and, turning over the written paper, he\ndisplayed upon the under side the Imperial vermilion Sign. \"Perhaps,\"\nhe continued, \"the omniscient person will still continue in his remarks,\neven with the evidence of the Emperor's unerring pencil to refute him.\"\n\nAt these words and the undoubted testimony of the red mark, which\nplainly declared the whole of the written matter to be composed of\ntruth, no matter what might afterwards transpire, Ling understood that\nvery little prosperity remained with him.\n\n\"But the town of Si-chow,\" he suggested, after examining his mind; \"if\nany person in authority visited the place, he would inevitably find it\nstanding and its inhabitants in agreeable health.\"\n\n\"The persistent person who is so assiduously occupying my intellectual\nmoments with empty words seems to be unaccountably deficient in his\nknowledge of the customs of refined society and of the meaning of the\nImperial Signet,\" said the other, with an entire absence of benevolent\nconsideration. \"That Si-chow has fallen and that Ling is dead are two\nutterly uncontroversial matters truthfully recorded. If a person visited\nSi-chow, he might find it rebuilt or even inhabited by those from the\nneighbouring villages or by evil spirits taking the forms of the ones\nwho formerly lived there; as in a like manner, Ling might be restored\nto existence by magic, or his body might be found and possessed by\nan outcast demon who desired to revisit the earth for a period. Such\ncircumstances do not in any way disturb the announcement that Si-chow\nhas without question fallen, and that Ling has officially ceased to\nlive, of which events notifications have been sent to all who are\nconcerned in the matters.\"\n\nAs the upper one ceased speaking, four strokes sounded upon the gong,\nand Ling immediately found himself carried into the street by the\ncurrent of both lesser and upper ones who poured forth at the signal.\nThe termination of this conversation left Ling in a more unenviable\nstate of dejection than any of the many preceding misfortunes had\ndone, for with enlarged inducements to possess himself of a competent\nappointment he seemed to be even further removed from this attainment\nthan he had been at any time in his life. He might, indeed, present\nhimself again for the public examinations; but in order to do even that\nit would be necessary for him to wait almost a year, nor could he assure\nhimself that his efforts would again be likely to result in an equal\nsuccess. Doubts also arose within his mind of the course which he should\nfollow in such a case; whether to adopt a new name, involving as it\nwould certain humiliation and perhaps disgrace if detection overtook\nhis footsteps, or still to possess the title of one who was in a measure\ndead, and hazard the likelihood of having any prosperity which he might\nobtain reduced to nothing if the fact should become public.\n\nAs Ling reflected upon such details he found himself without intention\nbefore the house of a wise person who had become very wealthy by\nadvising others on all matters, but chiefly on those connected with\nstrange occurrences and such events as could not be settled definitely\neither one way or the other until a remote period had been reached.\nBecoming assailed by a curious desire to know what manner of evils\nparticularly attached themselves to such as were officially dead but who\nnevertheless had an ordinary existence, Ling placed himself before this\nperson, and after arranging the manner of reward related to him so many\nof the circumstances as were necessary to enable a full understanding to\nbe reached, but at the same time in no way betraying his own interest in\nthe matter.\n\n\"Such inflictions are to no degree frequent,\" said the wise person after\nhe had consulted a polished sphere of the finest red jade for some\ntime; \"and this is in a measure to be regretted, as the hair of these\npersons--provided they die a violent death, which is invariably the\ncase--constitutes a certain protection against being struck by falling\nstars, or becoming involved in unsuccessful law cases. The persons in\nquestion can be recognized with certainty in the public ways by the\nunnatural pallor of their faces and by the general repulsiveness of\ntheir appearance, but as they soon take refuge in suicide, unless\nthey have the fortune to be removed previously by accident, it is an\ninfrequent matter that one is gratified by the sight. During their\nexistence they are subject to many disorders from which the generality\nof human beings are benevolently preserved; they possess no rights\nof any kind, and if by any chance they are detected in an act of a\nseemingly depraved nature, they are liable to judgment at the hands of\nthe passers-by without any form whatever, and to punishment of a more\nsevere order than that administered to commonplace criminals. There\nare many other disadvantages affecting such persons when they reach the\nMiddle Air, of which the chief--\"\n\n\"This person is immeasurably indebted for such a clear explanation of\nthe position,\" interrupted Ling, who had a feeling of not desiring\nto penetrate further into the detail; \"but as he perceives a line\nof anxious ones eagerly waiting at the door to obtain advice and\nconsolation from so expert and amiable a wizard, he will not make\nhimself uncongenial any longer with his very feeble topics of\nconversation.\"\n\nBy this time Ling plainly comprehended that he had been marked out\nfrom the beginning--perhaps for all the knowledge which he had to the\nopposite effect, from a period in the life of a far-removed ancestor--to\nbe an object of marked derision and the victim of all manner of\nmalevolent demons in whatever actions he undertook. In this condition\nof understanding his mind turned gratefully to the parting gift of Mian\nwhom he had now no hope of possessing; for the intolerable thought\nof uniting her to so objectionable a being as himself would have been\ndismissed as utterly inelegant even had he been in a manner of living\nto provide for her adequately, which itself seemed clearly impossible.\nDisregarding all similar emotions, therefore, he walked without pausing\nto his abode, and stretching his body upon the rushes, drank the entire\nliquid unhesitatingly, and prepared to pass beyond with a tranquil mind\nentirely given up to thoughts and images of Mian.\n\n\n\nX\n\nUpon a certain occasion, the particulars of which have already been\nrecorded, Ling had judged himself to have passed into the form of a\nspirit on beholding the ethereal form of Mian bending over him. After\nswallowing the entire liquid, which had cost the dead magician so much\nto distil and make perfect, it was with a well-assured determination of\nnever again awakening that he lost the outward senses and floated in the\nMiddle Air, so that when his eyes next opened upon what seemed to be\nthe bare walls of his own chamber, his first thought was a natural\nconviction that the matter had been so arranged either out of a\ncharitable desire that he should not be overcome by a too sudden\ntransition to unparalleled splendour, or that such a reception was the\noutcome of some dignified jest on the part of certain lesser and more\ncheerful spirits. After waiting in one position for several hours,\nhowever, and receiving no summons or manifestation of a celestial\nnature, he began to doubt the qualities of the liquid, and applying\ncertain tests, he soon ascertained that he was still in the lower world\nand unharmed. Nevertheless, this circumstance did not tend in any way\nto depress his mind, for, doubtless owing to some hidden virtue of\nthe fluid, he felt an enjoyable emotion that he still lived; all his\nattributes appeared to be purified, and he experienced an inspired\ncertainty of feeling that an illustrious and highly-remunerative future\nlay before one who still had an ordinary existence after being both\nofficially killed and self-poisoned.\n\nIn this intelligent disposition thoughts of Mian recurred to him with\nunreproved persistence, and in order to convey to her an account of the\nvarious matters which had engaged him since his arrival at the city, and\na well-considered declaration of the unchanged state of his own feelings\ntowards her, he composed and despatched with impetuous haste the\nfollowing delicate verses:\n\n\n\nCONSTANCY\n\n  About the walls and gates of Canton\n  Are many pleasing and entertaining maidens;\n  Indeed, in the eyes of their friends and of the passers-by\n  Some of them are exceptionally adorable.\n  The person who is inscribing these lines, however,\n  Sees before him, as it were, an assemblage of deformed and\n    un-prepossessing hags,\n  Venerable in age and inconsiderable in appearance;\n  For the dignified and majestic image of Mian is ever before him,\n  Making all others very inferior.\n\n  Within the houses and streets of Canton\n  Hang many bright lanterns.\n  The ordinary person who has occasion to walk by night\n  Professes to find them highly lustrous.\n  But there is one who thinks contrary facts,\n  And when he goes forth he carries two long curved poles\n  To prevent him from stumbling among the dark and hidden places;\n  For he has gazed into the brilliant and pellucid orbs of Mian,\n  And all other lights are dull and practically opaque.\n\n  In various parts of the literary quarter of Canton\n  Reside such as spend their time in inward contemplation.\n  In spite of their generally uninviting exteriors\n  Their reflexions are often of a very profound order.\n  Yet the unpopular and persistently-abused Ling\n  Would unhesitatingly prefer his own thoughts to theirs,\n  For what makes this person's thoughts far more pleasing\n  Is that they are invariably connected with the virtuous and\n    ornamental Mian.\n\nBecoming very amiably disposed after this agreeable occupation, Ling\nsurveyed himself at the disc of polished metal, and observed with\nsurprise and shame the rough and uninviting condition of his person. He\nhad, indeed, although it was not until some time later that he became\naware of the circumstance, slept for five days without interruption, and\nit need not therefore be a matter of wonder or of reproach to him that\nhis smooth surfaces had become covered with short hair. Reviling himself\nbitterly for the appearance which he conceived he must have exhibited\nwhen he conducted his business, and to which he now in part attributed\nhis ill-success, Ling went forth without delay, and quickly discovering\none of those who remove hair publicly for a very small sum, he placed\nhimself in the chair, and directed that his face, arms, and legs should\nbe denuded after the manner affected by the ones who make a practice of\nobserving the most recent customs.\n\n\"Did the illustrious individual who is now conferring distinction on\nthis really worn-out chair by occupying it express himself in favour of\nhaving the face entirely denuded?\" demanded the one who conducted the\noperation; for these persons have become famous for their elegant and\npersistent ability to discourse, and frequently assume ignorance in\norder that they themselves may make reply, and not for the purpose\nof gaining knowledge. \"Now, in the objectionable opinion of this\nunintelligent person, who has a presumptuous habit of offering his\nvery undesirable advice, a slight covering on the upper lip, delicately\narranged and somewhat fiercely pointed at the extremities, would\nbestow an appearance of--how shall this illiterate person explain\nhimself?--dignity?--matured reflexion?--doubtless the accomplished\nnobleman before me will understand what is intended with a more\nknife-like accuracy than this person can describe it--but confer that\nhighly desirable effect upon the face of which at present it is entirely\ndestitute... 'Entirely denuded?' Then without fail it shall certainly be\nso, O incomparable personage... Does the versatile Mandarin now present\nprofess any concern as to the condition of the rice plants?... Indeed,\nthe remark is an inspired one; the subject is totally devoid of interest\nto a person of intelligence ... A remarkable and gravity-removing event\ntranspired within the notice of this unassuming person recently. A\ndiscriminating individual had purchased from him a portion of his justly\nrenowned Thrice-extracted Essence of Celestial Herb Oil--a preparation\nwhich in this experienced person's opinion, indeed, would greatly\nrelieve the undoubted afflictions from which the one before him is\nevidently suffering--when after once anointing himself--\"\n\nA lengthy period containing no words caused Ling, who had in the\nmeantime closed his eyes and lost Canton and all else in delicate\nthoughts of Mian, to look up. That which met his attention on doing so\nfilled him with an intelligent wonder, for the person before him held in\nhis hand what had the appearance of a tuft of bright yellow hair, which\nshone in the light of the sun with a most engaging splendour, but which\nhe nevertheless regarded with a most undignified expression of confusion\nand awe.\n\n\"Illustrious demon,\" he cried at length, kow-towing very respectfully,\n\"have the extreme amiableness to be of a benevolent disposition, and do\nnot take an unworthy and entirely unremunerative revenge upon this\nvery unimportant person for failing to detect and honour you from the\nbeginning.\"\n\n\"Such words indicate nothing beyond an excess of hemp spirit,\" answered\nLing, with signs of displeasure. \"To gain my explicit esteem, make me\nsmooth without delay, and do not exhibit before me the lock of hair\nwhich, from its colour and appearance, has evidently adorned the head of\none of those maidens whose duty it is to quench the thirst of travellers\nin the long narrow rooms of this city.\"\n\n\"Majestic and anonymous spirit,\" said the other, with extreme reverence,\nand an entire absence of the appearance of one who had gazed into\ntoo many vessels, \"if such be your plainly-expressed desire, this\nsuperficial person will at once proceed to make smooth your peach-like\nskin, and with a carefulness inspired by the certainty that the most\nunimportant wound would give forth liquid fire, in which he would\nundoubtedly perish. Nevertheless, he desires to make it evident that\nthis hair is from the head of no maiden, being, indeed, the uneven\ntermination of your own sacred pigtail, which this excessively\nself-confident slave took the inexcusable liberty of removing, and which\nchanged in this manner within his hand in order to administer a fit\nreproof for his intolerable presumption.\"\n\nImpressed by the mien and unquestionable earnestness of the remover of\nhair, Ling took the matter which had occasioned these various emotions\nin his hand and examined it. His amazement was still greater when he\nperceived that--in spite of the fact that it presented every appearance\nof having been cut from his own person--none of the qualities of hair\nremained in it; it was hard and wire-like, possessing, indeed, both the\nnature and the appearance of a metal.\n\nAs he gazed fixedly and with astonishment, there came back into\nthe remembrance of Ling certain obscure and little-understood facts\nconnected with the limitless wealth possessed by the Yellow Emperor--of\nwhich the great gold life-like image in the Temple of Internal Symmetry\nat Peking alone bears witness now--and of his lost secret. Many very\nforcible prophecies and omens in his own earlier life, of which\nthe rendering and accomplishment had hitherto seemed to be dark and\nincomplete, passed before him, and various matters which Mian had\nrelated to him concerning the habits and speech of the magician took\ndefinite form within his mind. Deeply impressed by the exact manner in\nwhich all these circumstances fitted together, one into another, Ling\nrewarded the person before him greatly beyond his expectation, and\nhurried without delay to his own chamber.\n\n\n\nXI\n\nFor many hours Ling remained in his room, examining in his mind all\npassages, either in his own life or in the lives of others, which might\nby any chance have influence on the event before him. In this thorough\nway he became assured that the competition and its results, his journey\nto Si-chow with the encounter in the cypress wood, the flight of the\nincapable and treacherous Mandarin, and the battle of Ki, were all,\ndown to the matter of the smallest detail, parts of a symmetrical and\ncomplete scheme, tending to his present condition. Cheered and upheld\nby this proof of the fact that very able deities were at work on\nhis behalf, he turned his intellect from the entrancing subject to a\ncontemplation of the manner in which his condition would enable him to\nfrustrate the uninventive villainies of the obstinate person Li Keen,\nand to provide a suitable house and mode of living to which he would be\njustified in introducing Mian, after adequate marriage ceremonies had\nbeen observed between them. In this endeavour he was less successful\nthan he had imagined would be the case, for when he had first fully\nunderstood that his body was of such a substance that nothing was\nwanting to transmute it into fine gold but the absence of the living\nspirit, he had naturally, and without deeply examining the detail,\nassumed that so much gold might be considered to be in his possession.\nNow, however, a very definite thought arose within him that his own\nwishes and interests would have been better secured had the benevolent\nspirits who undertook the matter placed the secret within his knowledge\nin such a way as to enable him to administer the fluid to some very\nheavy and inexpensive animal, so that the issue which seemed inevitable\nbefore the enjoyment of the riches could be entered upon should not\nhave touched his own comfort so closely. To a person of Ling's refined\nimagination it could not fail to be a subject of internal reproach that\nwhile he would become the most precious dead body in the world, his\nvalue in life might not be very honourably placed even by the most\ncomplimentary one who should require his services. Then came the\nthought, which, however degraded, he found himself unable to put quite\nbeyond him, that if in the meantime he were able to gain a sufficiency\nfor Mian and himself, even her pure and delicate love might not be able\nto bear so offensive a test as that of seeing him grow old and remain\nintolerably healthy--perhaps with advancing years actually becoming\nlighter day by day, and thereby lessening in value before her eyes--when\nthe natural infirmities of age and the presence of an ever-increasing\nposterity would make even a moderate amount of taels of inestimable\nvalue.\n\nNo doubt remained in Ling's mind that the process of frequently making\nsmooth his surfaces would yield an amount of gold enough to suffice for\nhis own needs, but a brief consideration of the matter convinced him\nthat this source would be inadequate to maintain an entire household\neven if he continually denuded himself to an almost ignominious extent.\nAs he fully weighed these varying chances the certainty became more\nclear to him with every thought that for the virtuous enjoyment of\nMian's society one great sacrifice was required of him. This act, it\nseemed to be intimated, would without delay provide for an affluent\nand lengthy future, and at the same time would influence all the\nspirits--even those who had been hitherto evilly-disposed towards\nhim--in such a manner that his enemies would be removed from his path\nby a process which would expose them to public ridicule, and he would be\nassured in founding an illustrious and enduring line. To accomplish this\nsuccessfully necessitated the loss of at least the greater part of one\nentire member, and for some time the disadvantages of going through an\nexistence with only a single leg or arm seemed more than a sufficient\nprice to pay even for the definite advantages which would be made\nover to him in return. This unworthy thought, however, could not long\nwithstand the memory of Mian's steadfast and high-minded affection,\nand the certainty of her enlightened gladness at his return even in the\nimperfect condition which he anticipated. Nor was there absent from his\nmind a dimly-understood hope that the matter did not finally rest with\nhim, but that everything which he might be inspired to do was in reality\nonly a portion of the complete and arranged system into which he had\nbeen drawn, and in which his part had been assigned to him from the\nbeginning without power for him to deviate, no matter how much to the\ncontrary the thing should appear.\n\nAs no advantage would be gained by making any delay, Ling at once sought\nthe most favourable means of putting his resolution into practice, and\nafter many skilful and insidious inquiries he learnt of an accomplished\nperson who made a consistent habit of cutting off limbs which had become\ntroublesome to their possessors either through accident or disease.\nFurthermore, he was said to be of a sincere and charitable disposition,\nand many persons declared that on no occasion had he been known to\nmake use of the helpless condition of those who visited him in order to\nextort money from them.\n\nComing to the ill-considered conclusion that he would be able to conceal\nwithin his own breast the true reason for the operation, Ling placed\nhimself before the person in question, and exhibited the matter to\nhim so that it would appear as though his desires were promoted by the\npresence of a small but persistent sprite which had taken its abode\nwithin his left thigh, and there resisted every effort of the most\nexperienced wise persons to induce it to come forth again. Satisfied\nwith this explanation of the necessity of the deed, the one who\nundertook the matter proceeded, with Ling's assistance, to sharpen his\ncutting instruments and to heat the hardening irons; but no sooner had\nhe made a shallow mark to indicate the lines which his knife should\ntake, than his subtle observation at once showed him that the facts had\nbeen represented to him in a wrong sense, and that his visitor, indeed,\nwas composed of no common substance. Being of a gentle and forbearing\ndisposition, he did not manifest any indication of rage at the\ndiscovery, but amiably and unassumingly pointed out that such a course\nwas not respectful towards himself, and that, moreover, Ling might incur\ncertain well-defined and highly undesirable maladies as a punishment for\nthe deception.\n\nOvercome with remorse at deceiving so courteous and noble-minded\na person, Ling fully explained the circumstances to him, not even\nconcealing from him certain facts which related to the actions of remote\nancestors, but which, nevertheless, appeared to have influenced the\nsuccession of events. When he had made an end of the narrative, the\nother said:\n\n\"Behold now, it is truly remarked that every Mandarin has three hands\nand every soldier a like number of feet, yet it is a saying which is\nrather to be regarded as manifesting the deep wisdom and discrimination\nof the speaker than as an actual fact which can be taken advantage of\nwhen one is so minded--least of all by so valiant a Commander as the one\nbefore me, who has clearly proved that in time of battle he has exactly\nreversed the position.\"\n\n\"The loss would undoubtedly be of considerable inconvenience\noccasionally,\" admitted Ling, \"yet none the less the sage remark of Huai\nMei-shan, 'When actually in the embrace of a voracious and powerful\nwild animal, the desirability of leaving a limb is not a matter to be\nsubjected to lengthy consideration,' is undoubtedly a valuable guide for\ngeneral conduct. This person has endured many misfortunes and suffered\nmany injustices; he has known the wolf-gnawings of great hopes, which\nhave withered and daily grown less when the difficulties of maintaining\nan honourable and illustrious career have unfolded themselves within his\nsight. Before him still lie the attractions of a moderate competency to\nbe shared with the one whose absence would make even the Upper Region\nunendurable, and after having this entrancing future once shattered\nby the tiger-like cupidity of a depraved and incapable Mandarin, he is\ndetermined to welcome even the sacrifice which you condemn rather than\nlet the opportunity vanish through indecision.\"\n\n\"It is not an unworthy or abandoned decision,\" said the one whose aid\nLing had invoked, \"nor a matter in which this person would refrain from\ntaking part, were there no other and more agreeable means by which the\nsame results may be attained. A circumstance has occurred within\nthis superficial person's mind, however: A brother of the one who\nis addressing you is by profession one of those who purchase large\nundertakings for which they have not the money to pay, and who thereupon\nby various expedients gain the ear of the thrifty, enticing them by fair\noffers of return to entrust their savings for the purpose of paying off\nthe debt. These persons are ever on the watch for transactions by which\nthey inevitably prosper without incurring any obligation, and doubtless\nmy brother will be able to gather a just share of the value of your\nhighly-remunerative body without submitting you to the insufferable\nannoyance of losing a great part of it prematurely.\"\n\nWithout clearly understanding how so inviting an arrangement could be\neffected, the manner of speaking was exceedingly alluring to Ling's\nmind, perplexed as he had become through weighing and considering\nthe various attitudes of the entire matter. To receive a certain and\nsufficient sum of money without his person being in any way mutilated\nwould be a satisfactory, but as far as he had been able to observe an\nunapproachable, solution to the difficulty. In the mind of the amiable\nperson with whom he was conversing, however, the accomplishment did not\nappear to be surrounded by unnatural obstacles, so that Ling was content\nto leave the entire design in his hands, after stating that he would\nagain present himself on a certain occasion when it was asserted that\nthe brother in question would be present.\n\nSo internally lightened did Ling feel after this inspiring conversation,\nand so confident of a speedy success had the obliging person's words\nmade him become, that for the first time since his return to Canton he\nwas able to take an intellectual interest in the pleasures of the city.\nBecoming aware that the celebrated play entitled \"The Precious Lamp\nof Spotted Butterfly Temple\" was in process of being shown at the Tea\nGarden of Rainbow Lights and Voices, he purchased an entrance, and after\npassing several hours in this conscientious enjoyment, returned to\nhis chamber, and passed a night untroubled by any manifestations of an\nunpleasant nature.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nChang-ch'un, the brother of the one to whom Ling had applied in his\ndetermination, was confidently stated to be one of the richest persons\nin Canton. So great was the number of enterprises in which he had\npossessions, that he himself was unable to keep an account of them,\nand it was asserted that upon occasions he had run through the streets,\ncrying aloud that such an undertaking had been the subject of most\ninferior and uninviting dreams and omens (a custom observed by those who\nwish a venture ill), whereas upon returning and consulting his written\nparchments, it became plain to him that he had indulged in a very\nobjectionable exhibition, as he himself was the person most interested\nin the success of the matter. Far from discouraging him, however, such\nincidents tended to his advantage, as he could consistently point to\nthem in proof of his unquestionable commercial honourableness, and in\nthis way many persons of all classes, not only in Canton, or in the\nProvince, but all over the Empire, would unhesitatingly entrust money\nto be placed in undertakings which he had purchased and was willing to\ndescribe as \"of much good.\" A certain class of printed leaves--those in\nwhich Chang-ch'un did not insert purchased mentions of his forthcoming\nventures or verses recording his virtues (in return for buying many\nexamples of the printed leaf containing them)--took frequent occasion of\nreminding persons that Chang-ch'un owed the beginning of his prosperity\nto finding a written parchment connected with a Mandarin of exalted rank\nand a low caste attendant at the Ti-i tea-house among the paper\nheaps, which it was at that time his occupation to assort into various\ndepartments according to their quality and commercial value. Such\nprinted leaves freely and unhesitatingly predicted that the day on which\nhe would publicly lose face was incomparably nearer than that on which\nthe Imperial army would receive its back pay, and in a quaint and\ngravity-removing manner advised him to protect himself against an\nobscure but inevitable poverty by learning the accomplishment of\nchair-carrying--an occupation for which his talents and achievements\nfitted him in a high degree, they remarked.\n\nIn spite of these evilly intentioned remarks, and of illustrations\nrepresenting him as being bowstrung for treacherous killing, being\nseized in the action of secretly conveying money from passers-by to\nhimself and other similar annoying references to his private life,\nChang-ch'un did not fail to prosper, and his undertakings succeeded to\nsuch an extent that without inquiry into the detail many persons were\ncontent to describe as \"gold-lined\" anything to which he affixed his\nsign, and to hazard their savings for staking upon the ventures. In all\nother departments of life Chang was equally successful; his chief wife\nwas the daughter of one who stood high in the Emperor's favour; his\nrepast table was never unsupplied with sea-snails, rats' tongues,\nor delicacies of an equally expensive nature, and it was confidently\nmaintained that there was no official in Canton, not even putting aside\nthe Taotai, who dare neglect to fondle Chang's hand if he publicly\noffered it to him for that purpose.\n\nIt was at the most illustrious point of his existence--at the time,\nindeed, when after purchasing without money the renowned and proficient\ncharm-water Ho-Ko for a million taels, he had sold it again for\nten--that Chang was informed by his brother of the circumstances\nconnected with Ling. After becoming specially assured that the matter\nwas indeed such as it was represented to be, Chang at once discerned\nthat the venture was of too certain and profitable a nature to be put\nbefore those who entrusted their money to him in ordinary and doubtful\ncases. He accordingly called together certain persons whom he was\ndesirous of obliging, and informing them privately and apart\nfrom business terms that the opportunity was one of exceptional\nattractiveness, he placed the facts before them. After displaying a\nnumber of diagrams bearing upon the mater, he proposed that they should\nform an enterprise to be called \"The Ling (After Death) Without Much\nRisk Assembly.\" The manner of conducting this undertaking he explained\nto be as follows: The body of Ling, whenever the spirit left it, should\nbecome as theirs to be used for profit. For this benefit they would pay\nLing fifty thousand taels when the understanding was definitely arrived\nat, five thousand taels each year until the matter ended, and when that\nperiod arrived another fifty thousand taels to persons depending upon\nhim during his life. Having stated the figure business, Chang-ch'un\nput down his written papers, and causing his face to assume the look of\nirrepressible but dignified satisfaction which it was his custom to wear\non most occasions, and especially when he had what appeared at first\nsight to be evil news to communicate to public assemblages of those\nwho had entrusted money to his ventures, he proceeded to disclose the\nadvantages of such a system. At the extreme, he said, the amount which\nthey would be required to pay would be two hundred and fifty\nthousand taels; but this was in reality a very misleading view of the\ncircumstance, as he would endeavour to show them. For one detail, he had\nallotted to Ling thirty years of existence, which was the extreme amount\naccording to the calculations of those skilled in such prophecies; but,\nas they were all undoubtedly aware, persons of very expert intellects\nwere known to enjoy a much shorter period of life than the gross and\nordinary, and as Ling was clearly one of the former, by the fact of his\ncontriving so ingenious a method of enriching himself, they might with\nreasonable foresight rely upon his departing when half the period had\nbeen attained; in that way seventy-five thousand taels would be restored\nto them, for every year represented a saving of five thousand. Another\nagreeable contemplation was that of the last sum, for by such a time\nthey would have arrived at the most pleasurable part of the enterprise:\na million taels' worth of pure gold would be displayed before them, and\nthe question of the final fifty thousand could be disposed of by cutting\noff an arm or half a leg. Whether they adopted that course, or decided\nto increase their fortunes by exposing so exceptional and symmetrical a\nwonder to the public gaze in all the principal cities of the Empire, was\na circumstance which would have to be examined within their minds when\nthe time approached. In such a way the detail of purchase stood\nrevealed as only fifty thousand taels in reality, a sum so despicably\ninsignificant that he had internal pains at mentioning it to so wealthy\na group of Mandarins, and he had not yet made clear to them that each\nyear they would receive gold to the amount of almost a thousand taels.\nThis would be the result of Ling making smooth his surfaces, and it\nwould enable them to know that the person in question actually existed,\nand to keep the circumstances before their intellects.\n\nWhen Chang-Ch'un had made the various facts clear to this extent, those\nwho were assembled expressed their feelings as favourably turned towards\nthe project, provided the tests to which Ling was to be put should prove\nencouraging, and a secure and intelligent understanding of things to be\ndone and not to be done could be arrived at between them. To this end\nLing was brought into the chamber, and fixing his thoughts steadfastly\nupon Mian, he permitted portions to be cut from various parts of his\nbody without betraying any signs of ignoble agitation. No sooner had\nthe pieces been separated and the virtue of Ling's existence passed from\nthem than they changed colour and hardened, nor could the most delicate\nand searching trials to which they were exposed by a skilful worker\nin metals, who was obtained for the purpose, disclose any particular,\nhowever minute, in which they differed from the finest gold. The hair,\nthe nails, and the teeth were similarly affected, and even Ling's\nblood dried into a fine gold powder. This detail of the trial being\nsuccessfully completed, Ling subjected himself to intricate questioning\non all matters connected with his religion and manner of conducting\nhimself, both in public and privately, the history and behaviour of his\nancestors, the various omens and remarkable sayings which had reference\nto his life and destiny, and the intentions which he then possessed\nregarding his future movements and habits of living. All the wise\nsayings and written and printed leaves which made any allusion to the\nexistence of and possibility of discovery of the wonderful gold fluid\nwere closely examined, and found to be in agreement, whereupon those\npresent made no further delay in admitting that the facts were indeed\nas they had been described, and indulged in a dignified stroking of\neach other's faces as an expression of pleasure and in proof of their\nsatisfaction at taking part in so entrancing and remunerative an affair.\nAt Chang's command many rare and expensive wines were then brought\nin, and partaken of without restraint by all persons, the repast being\nlightened by numerous well-considered and gravity-removing jests having\nreference to Ling and the unusual composition of his person. So amiably\nwere the hours occupied that it was past the time of no light when Chang\nrose and read at full length the statement of things to be done and\nthings not to be done, which was to be sealed by Ling for his part and\nthe other persons who were present for theirs. It so happened, however,\nthat at that period Ling's mind was filled with brilliant and versatile\nthoughts and images of Mian, and many-hued visions of the manner in\nwhich they would spend the entrancing future which was now before them,\nand in this way it chanced that he did not give any portion of his\nintellect to the reading, mistaking it, indeed, for a delicate and very\nably-composed set of verses which Chang-ch'un was reciting as a formal\nblessing on parting. Nor was it until he was desired to affix his\nsign that Ling discovered his mistake, and being of too respectful and\nunobtrusive a disposition to require the matter to be repeated then, he\ncarried out the obligation without in any particular understanding the\nwritten words to which he was agreeing.\n\nAs Ling walked through the streets to his chamber after leaving the\nhouse and company of Chang-Ch'un, holding firmly among his garments the\nthin printed papers to the amount of fifty thousand taels which he had\nreceived, and repeatedly speaking to himself in terms of general and\nspecific encouragement at the fortunate events of the past few days, he\nbecame aware that a person of mean and rapacious appearance, whom he\nhad some memory of having observed within the residence he had but\njust left, was continually by his side. Not at first doubting that\nthe circumstance resulted from a benevolent desire on the part of\nChang-ch'un that he should be protected on his passage through the city,\nLing affected not to observe the incident; but upon reaching his own\ndoor the person in question persistently endeavoured to pass in also.\nForming a fresh judgment about the matter, Ling, who was very powerfully\nconstructed, and whose natural instincts were enhanced in every degree\nby the potent fluid of which he had lately partaken, repeatedly threw\nhim across the street until he became weary of the diversion. At\nlength, however, the thought arose that one who patiently submitted\nto continually striking the opposite houses with his head must have\nsomething of importance to communicate, whereupon he courteously invited\nhim to enter the apartment and unweigh his mind.\n\n\"The facts of the case appear to have been somewhat inadequately\nrepresented,\" said the stranger, bowing obsequiously, \"for this\nunornamental person was assured by the benignant Chang-ch'un that the\none whose shadow he was to become was of a mild and forbearing nature.\"\n\n\"Such words are as the conversation of birds to me,\" replied Ling, not\nconjecturing how the matter had fallen about. \"This person has just left\nthe presence of the elegant and successful Chang-ch'un, and no word that\nhe spoke gave indication of such a follower or such a service.\"\n\n\"Then it is indeed certain that the various transactions have not been\nfully understood,\" exclaimed the other, \"for the exact communication to\nthis unseemly one was, 'The valuable and enlightened Ling has heard and\nagreed to the different things to be done and not to be done, one\nphrase of which arranges for your continual presence, so that he will\nanticipate your attentions.'\"\n\nAt these words the truth became as daylight before Ling's eyes, and\nhe perceived that the written paper to which he had affixed his sign\ncontained the detail of such an office as that of the person before him.\nWhen too late, more than ever did he regret that he had not formed some\npretext for causing the document to be read a second time, as in view of\nhis immediate intentions such an arrangement as the one to which he had\nagreed had every appearance of becoming of an irksome and perplexing\nnature. Desiring to know the length of the attendant's commands, Ling\nasked him for a clear statement of his duties, feigning that he had\nmissed that portion of the reading through a momentary attack of the\ngiddy sickness. To this request the stranger, who explained that his\nname was Wang, instantly replied that his written and spoken orders\nwere: never to permit more than an arm's length of space to separate\nthem; to prevent, by whatever force was necessary for the purpose, all\nattempts at evading the things to be done and not to be done, and to\nignore as of no interest all other circumstances. It seemed to Ling,\nin consequence, that little seclusion would be enjoyed unless an\narrangement could be effected between Wang and himself; so to this end,\nafter noticing the evident poverty and covetousness of the person in\nquestion, he made him an honourable offer of frequent rewards, provided\na greater distance was allowed to come between them as soon as Si-chow\nwas reached. On his side, Ling undertook not to break through the\nwording of the things to be done and not to be done, and to notify to\nWang any movements upon which he meditated. In this reputable manner\nthe obstacle was ingeniously removed, and the intelligent nature of the\ndevice was clearly proved by the fact that not only Ling but Wang also\nhad in the future a much greater liberty of action than would have\nbeen possible if it had been necessary to observe the short-sighted and\nevidently hastily-thought-of condition which Chang-ch'un had endeavoured\nto impose.\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nIn spite of his natural desire to return to Mian as quickly as possible,\nLing judged it expedient to give several days to the occupation of\npurchasing apparel of the richest kinds, weapons and armour in large\nquantities, jewels and ornaments of worked metals and other objects to\nindicate his changed position. Nor did he neglect actions of a pious\nand charitable nature, for almost his first care was to arrange with the\nchief ones at the Temple of Benevolent Intentions that each year, on the\nday corresponding to that on which he drank the gold fluid, a sumptuous\nand well-constructed coffin should be presented to the most deserving\npoor and aged person within that quarter of the city in which he had\nresided. When these preparations were completed, Ling set out with an\nextensive train of attendants; but riding on before, accompanied only by\nWang, he quickly reached Si-chow without adventure.\n\nThe meeting between Ling and Mian was affecting to such an extent\nthat the blind and deaf attendants wept openly without reproach,\nnotwithstanding the fact that neither could become possessed of more\nthan a half of the occurrence. Eagerly the two reunited ones examined\neach other's features to discover whether the separation had brought\nabout any change in the beloved and well-remembered lines. Ling\ndiscovered upon Mian the shadow of an anxious care at his absence, while\nthe disappointments and trials which Ling had experienced in Canton had\nleft traces which were plainly visible to Mian's penetrating gaze. In\nsuch an entrancing occupation the time was to them without hours until\na feeling of hunger recalled them to lesser matters, when a variety\nof very select foods and liquids was placed before them without delay.\nAfter this elegant repast had been partaken of, Mian, supporting herself\nupon Ling's shoulder, made a request that he would disclose to her all\nthe matters which had come under his observation both within the city\nand during his journey to and from that place. Upon this encouragement,\nLing proceeded to unfold his mind, not withholding anything which\nappeared to be of interest, no matter how slight. When he had reached\nCanton without any perilous adventure, Mian breathed more freely; as he\nrecorded the interview at the Office of Warlike Deeds and Arrangements,\nshe trembled at the insidious malignity of the evil person Li Keen. The\nconversation with the wise reader of the future concerning the various\nstates of such as be officially dead almost threw her into the rigid\nsickness, from which, however, the wonderful circumstance of the\ndiscovered properties of the gold fluid quickly recalled her. But to\nLing's great astonishment no sooner had he made plain the exceptional\nadvantages which he had derived from the circumstances, and the nature\nof the undertaking at which he had arrived with Chang-ch'un, than she\nbecame a prey to the most intolerable and unrestrained anguish.\n\n\"Oh, my devoted but excessively ill-advised lover,\" she exclaimed\nwildly, and in tones which clearly indicated that she was inspired by\nevery variety of affectionate emotion, \"has the unendurable position\nin which you and all your household will be placed by the degrading\ncommercial schemes and instincts of the mercenary-souled person\nChang-ch'un occupied no place in your generally well-regulated\nintellect? Inevitably will those who drink our almond tea, in order\nto have an opportunity of judging the value of the appointments of the\nhouse, pass the jesting remark that while the Lings assuredly have 'a\ndead person's bones in the secret chamber,' at the present they will not\nhave one in the family graveyard by reason of the death of Ling himself.\nBetter to lose a thousand limbs during life than the entire person after\ndeath; nor would your adoring Mian hesitate to clasp proudly to her\norgan of affection the veriest trunk that had parted with all its\nattributes in a noble and sacrificing endeavour to preserve at least\nsome dignified proportions to embellish the Ancestral Temple and to\nreceive the worship of posterity.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" replied Ling, with extravagant humiliation, \"it is indeed true;\nand this person is degraded beyond the common lot of those who break\nimages and commit thefts from sacred places. The side of the transaction\nwhich is at present engaging our attention never occurred to this\nsuperficial individual until now.\"\n\n\"Wise and incomparable one,\" said Mian, in no degree able to restrain\nthe fountains of bitter water which clouded her delicate and expressive\neyes, \"in spite of this person's biting and ungracious words do not, she\nmakes a formal petition, doubt the deathless strength of her affection.\nCheerfully, in order to avert the matter in question, or even to save\nher lover the anguish of unavailing and soul-eating remorse, would she\nconsign herself to a badly-constructed and slow-consuming fire or expose\nher body to various undignified tortures. Happy are those even to whom\nis left a little ash to be placed in a precious urn and diligently\nguarded, for it, in any event, truly represents all that is left of the\nonce living person, whereas after an honourable and spotless existence\nmy illustrious but unthinking lord will be blended with a variety of\nbaser substances and passed from hand to hand, his immaculate organs\nserving to reward murderers for their deeds and to tempt the weak and\nvicious to all manner of unmentionable crimes.\"\n\nSo overcome was Ling by the distressing nature of the oversight he had\npermitted that he could find no words with which to comfort Mian, who,\nafter some moments, continued:\n\n\"There are even worse visions of degradation which occur to this person.\nBy chance, that which was once the noble-minded Ling may be disposed of,\nnot to the Imperial Treasury for converting into pieces of exchange, but\nto some undiscriminating worker in metals who will fashion out of his\nbeautiful and symmetrical stomach an elegant food-dish, so that from the\nultimate developments of the circumstance may arise the fact that his\nown descendants, instead of worshipping him, use his internal organs\nfor this doubtful if not absolutely unclean purpose, and thereby suffer\nnumerous well-merited afflictions, to the end that the finally-despised\nLing and this discredited person, instead of founding a vigorous and\nprolific generation, become the parents of a line of feeble-minded and\nphysically-depressed lepers.\"\n\n\"Oh, my peacock-eyed one!\" exclaimed Ling, in immeasurable distress, \"so\nproficient an exhibition of virtuous grief crushes this misguided person\ncompletely to the ground. Rather would he uncomplainingly lose his\npigtail than--\"\n\n\"Such a course,\" said a discordant voice, as the unpresentable person\nWang stepped forth from behind a hanging curtain, where, indeed, he had\nstood concealed during the entire conversation, \"is especially forbidden\nby the twenty-third detail of the things to be done and not to be done.\"\n\n\"What new adversity is this?\" cried Mian, pressing to Ling with a still\ncloser embrace. \"Having disposed of your incomparable body after death,\nsurely an adequate amount of liberty and seclusion remains to us during\nlife.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" interposed the dog-like Wang, \"the refined person in\nquestion must not attempt to lose or to dispose of his striking and\ninvaluable pigtail; for by such an action he would be breaking through\nhis spoken and written word whereby he undertook to be ruled by the\nthings to be done and not to be done; and he would also be robbing the\ningenious-minded Chang-ch'un.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" lamented the unhappy Ling, \"that which appeared to be the end of\nall this person's troubles is obviously simply the commencement of a new\nand more extensive variety. Understand, O conscientious but exceedingly\ninopportune Wang, that the words which passed from this person's mouth\ndid not indicate a fixed determination, but merely served to show the\nunfeigned depth of his emotion. Be content that he has no intention of\nevading the definite principles of the things to be done and not to\nbe done, and in the meantime honour this commonplace establishment by\nretiring to the hot and ill-ventilated chamber, and there partaking of a\nsuitable repast which shall be prepared without delay.\"\n\nWhen Wang had departed, which he did with somewhat unseemly haste,\nLing made an end of recording his narrative, which Mian's grief had\ninterrupted. In this way he explained to her the reason of Wang's\npresence, and assured her that by reason of the arrangement he had made\nwith that person, his near existence would not be so unsupportable to\nthem as might at first appear to be the case.\n\nWhile they were still conversing together, and endeavouring to divert\ntheir minds from the objectionable facts which had recently come within\ntheir notice, an attendant entered and disclosed that the train of\nservants and merchandise which Ling had preceded on the journey was\narriving. At this fresh example of her lover's consistent thought\nfor her, Mian almost forgot her recent agitation, and eagerly lending\nherself to the entrancing occupation of unfolding and displaying the\nvarious objects, her brow finally lost the last trace of sadness.\nGreatly beyond the imaginings of anticipation were the expensive\narticles with which Ling proudly surrounded her; and in examining and\nlearning the cost of the set jewels and worked metals, the ornamental\ngarments for both persons, the wood and paper appointments for the\nhouse--even incenses, perfumes, spices and rare viands had not been\nforgotten--the day was quickly and profitably spent.\n\nWhen the hour of sunset arrived, Ling, having learned that certain\npreparations which he had commanded were fully carried out, took Mian by\nthe hand and led her into the chief apartment of the house, where were\nassembled all the followers and attendants, even down to the illiterate\nand superfluous Wang. In the centre of the room upon a table of the\nfinest ebony stood a vessel of burning incense, some dishes of the most\nhighly-esteemed fruit, and an abundance of old and very sweet wine.\nBefore these emblems Ling and Mian placed themselves in an attitude of\ndeep humiliation, and formally expressed their gratitude to the Chief\nDeity for having called them into existence, to the cultivated earth\nfor supplying them with the means of sustaining life, to the Emperor for\nproviding the numerous safeguards by which their persons were protected\nat all times, and to their parents for educating them. This adequate\nceremony being completed, Ling explicitly desired all those present to\nobserve the fact that the two persons in question were, by that fact and\nfrom that time, made as one being, and the bond between them, incapable\nof severance.\n\nWhen the ruling night-lantern came out from among the clouds, Ling and\nMian became possessed of a great desire to go forth with pressed hands\nand look again on the forest paths and glades in which they had spent\nmany hours of exceptional happiness before Ling's journey to Canton.\nLeaving the attendants to continue the feasting and drum-beating in a\ncompletely unrestrained manner, they therefore passed out unperceived,\nand wandering among the trees, presently stood on the banks of the\nHeng-Kiang.\n\n\"Oh, my beloved!\" exclaimed Mian, gazing at the brilliant and unruffled\nwater, \"greatly would this person esteem a short river journey, such as\nwe often enjoyed together in the days when you were recovering.\"\n\nLing, to whom the expressed desires of Mian were as the word of the\nEmperor, instantly prepared the small and ornamental junk which was\nfastened near for this purpose, and was about to step in, when a\npresumptuous and highly objectionable hand restrained him.\n\n\"Behold,\" remarked a voice which Ling had some difficulty in ascribing\nto any known person, so greatly had it changed from its usual tone,\n\"behold how the immature and altogether too-inferior Ling observes his\nspoken and written assertions!\"\n\nAt this low-conditioned speech, Ling drew his well-tempered sword\nwithout further thought, in spite of the restraining arms of Mian,\nbut at the sight of the utterly incapable person Wang, who stood near\nsmiling meaninglessly and waving his arms with a continuous and backward\nmotion, he again replaced it.\n\n\"Such remarks can be left to fall unheeded from the lips of one who\nbears every indication of being steeped in rice spirit,\" he said with\nunprovoked dignity.\n\n\"It will be the plain duty of this expert and uncorruptible person\nto furnish the unnecessary, but, nevertheless, very severe and\nself-opinionated Chang-ch'un with a written account of how the\ntraitorous and deceptive Ling has endeavoured to break through the\nthirty-fourth vessel of the liquids to be consumed and not to be\nconsumed,\" continued Wang with increased deliberation and an entire\nabsence of attention to Ling's action and speech, \"and how by this\nrefined person's unfailing civility and resourceful strategy he has been\nfrustrated.\"\n\n\"Perchance,\" said Ling, after examining his thoughts for a short space,\nand reflecting that the list of things to be done and not to be done was\nto him as a blank leaf, \"there may even be some small portion of that\nwhich is accurate in his statement. In what manner,\" he continued,\naddressing the really unendurable person, who was by this time preparing\nto pass the night in the cool swamp by the river's edge, \"does this\none endanger any detail of the written and sealed parchment by such an\naction?\"\n\n\"Inasmuch,\" replied Wang, pausing in the process of removing his\nouter garments, \"as the seventy-ninth--the intricate name given\nto it escapes this person's tongue at the moment--but the\nninety-seventh--experLingknowswhamean--provides that any person, with or\nwithout, attempting or not avoiding to travel by sea, lake, or river,\nor to place himself in such a position as he may reasonably and\nintelligently be drowned in salt water, fresh water, or--or honourable\nrice spirit, shall be guilty of, and suffer--complete loss of memory.\"\nWith these words the immoderate and contemptible person sank down in a\nvery profound slumber.\n\n\"Alas!\" said Ling, turning to Mian, who stood near, unable to retire\neven had she desired, by reason of the extreme agitation into which\nthe incident had thrown her delicate mind and body, \"how intensely\naggravating a circumstance that we are compelled to entertain so\ndissolute a one by reason of this person's preoccupation when the matter\nwas read. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely that the detail he spoke of\nwas such as he insisted, to the extent of making it a thing not to be\ndone to journey in any manner by water. It shall be an early endeavour\nof this person to get these restraining details equitably amended; but\nin the meantime we will retrace our footsteps through the wood, and\nthe enraptured Ling will make a well-thought-out attempt to lighten the\npassage by a recital of his recently-composed verses on the subject of\n'Exile from the Loved One; or, Farewell and Return.'\"\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\"My beloved lord!\" said Mian sadly, on a morning after many days had\npassed since the return of Ling, \"have you not every possession for\nwhich the heart of a wise person searches? Yet the dark mark is scarcely\never absent from your symmetrical brow. If she who stands before you,\nand is henceforth an integral part of your organization, has failed you\nin any particular, no matter how unimportant, explain the matter to her,\nand the amendment will be a speedy and a joyful task.\"\n\nIt was indeed true that Ling's mind was troubled, but the fault did not\nlie with Mian, as the person in question was fully aware, for before\nher eyes as before those of Ling the unevadable compact which had been\nentered into with Chang-ch'un was ever present, insidiously planting\nbitterness within even the most select and accomplished delights. Nor\nwith increasing time did the obstinate and intrusive person Wang become\nmore dignified in his behaviour; on the contrary, he freely made use of\nhis position to indulge in every variety of abandonment, and almost each\nday he prevented, by reason of his knowledge of the things to be done\nand not to be done, some refined and permissible entertainment\nupon which Ling and Mian had determined. Ling had despatched many\ncommunications upon this subject to Chang-ch'un, praying also that\nsome expert way out of the annoyance of the lesser and more unimportant\nthings not to be done should be arrived at, but the time when he might\nreasonably expect an answer to these written papers had not yet arrived.\n\nIt was about this period that intelligence was brought to Ling from the\nvillages on the road to Peking, how Li Keen, having secretly ascertained\nthat his Yamen was standing and his goods uninjured, had determined\nto return, and was indeed at that hour within a hundred li of Si-chow.\nFurthermore, he had repeatedly been understood to pronounce clearly\nthat he considered Ling to be the head and beginning of all his\ninconveniences, and to declare that the first act of justice which\nhe should accomplish on his return would be to submit the person in\nquestion to the most unbearable tortures, and then cause him to lose his\nhead publicly as an outrager of the settled state of things and an\nenemy of those who loved tranquillity. Not doubting that Li Keen would\nendeavour to gain an advantage by treachery if the chance presented\nitself, Ling determined to go forth to meet him, and without delay\nsettle the entire disturbance in one well-chosen and fatally-destructive\nencounter. To this end, rather than disturb the placid mind of Mian,\nto whom the thought of the engagement would be weighted with many\ndisquieting fears, he gave out that he was going upon an expedition\nto surprise and capture certain fish of a very delicate flavour, and\nattended by only two persons, he set forth in the early part of the day.\n\nSome hours later, owing to an ill-considered remark on the part of the\ndeaf attendant, to whom the matter had been explained in an imperfect\nlight, Mian became possessed of the true facts of the case, and\nimmediately all the pleasure of existence went from her. She despaired\nof ever again beholding Ling in an ordinary state, and mournfully\nreproached herself for the bitter words which had risen to her lips when\nthe circumstance of his condition and the arrangement with Chang-ch'un\nfirst became known to her. After spending an interval in a polished\nlament at the manner in which things were inevitably tending, the\nthought occurred to Mian whether by any means in her power she could\ninfluence the course and settled method of affairs. In this situation\nthe memory of the person Wang, and the fact that on several occasions he\nhad made himself objectionable when Ling had proposed to place himself\nin such a position that he incurred some very remote chance of death\nby drowning or by fire, recurred to her. Subduing the natural and\npure-minded repulsion which she invariably experienced at the mere\nthought of so debased an individual, she sought for him, and discovering\nhim in the act of constructing cardboard figures of men and animals,\nwhich it was his custom to dispose skilfully in little-frequented paths\nfor the purpose of enjoying the sudden terror of those who passed by,\nshe quickly put the matter before him, urging him, by some means, to\nprevent the encounter, which must assuredly cost the life of the one\nwhom he had so often previously obstructed from incurring the slightest\nrisk.\n\n\"By no means,\" exclaimed Wang, when he at length understood the full\nmeaning of the project; \"it would be a most unpresentable action for\nthis commonplace person to interfere in so honourable an undertaking.\nHad the priceless body of the intrepid Ling been in any danger of\ndisappearing, as, for example, by drowning or being consumed in fire,\nthe nature of the circumstance would have been different. As the\nmatter exists, however, there is every appearance that the far-seeing\nChang-ch'un will soon reap the deserved reward of his somewhat\nspeculative enterprise, and to that end this person will immediately\nprocure a wooden barrier and the services of four robust carriers, and\nproceed to the scene of the conflict.\"\n\nDeprived of even this hope of preventing the encounter, Mian betook\nherself in extreme dejection to the secret room of the magician, which\nhad been unopened since the day when the two attendants had searched for\nsubstances to apply to their master, and there she diligently examined\nevery object in the remote chance of discovering something which might\nprove of value in averting the matter in question.\n\nNot anticipating that the true reason of his journey would become known\nto Mian, Ling continued on his way without haste, and passing through\nSi-chow before the sun had risen, entered upon the great road to Peking.\nAt a convenient distance from the town he came to a favourable piece of\nground where he decided to await the arrival of Li Keen, spending the\ntime profitably in polishing his already brilliant sword, and making\nobservations upon the nature of the spot and the condition of the\nsurrounding omens, on which the success of his expedition would largely\ndepend.\n\nAs the sun reached the highest point in the open sky the sound of an\napproaching company could be plainly heard; but at the moment when the\nchair of the Mandarin appeared within the sight of those who waited, the\ngreat luminary, upon which all portents depend directly or indirectly,\nchanged to the colour of new-drawn blood and began to sink towards\nthe earth. Without any misgivings, therefore, Ling disposed his two\nattendants in the wood, with instructions to step forth and aid him if\nhe should be attacked by overwhelming numbers, while he himself remained\nin the way. As the chair approached, the Mandarin observed a person\nstanding alone, and thinking that it was one who, hearing of his return,\nhad come out of the town to honour him, he commanded the bearers to\npause. Thereupon, stepping up to the opening, Ling struck the deceptive\nand incapable Li Keen on the cheek, at the same time crying in a full\nvoice, \"Come forth, O traitorous and two-stomached Mandarin! for this\nperson is very desirous of assisting you in the fulfilment of your\nboastful words. Here is a most irreproachable sword which will serve\nexcellently to cut off this person's undignified head; here is a\nwaistcord which can be tightened around his breast, thereby producing\nexcruciating pains over the entire body.\"\n\nAt the knowledge of who the one before him was, and when he heard the\nwords which unhesitatingly announced Ling's fixed purpose, Li Keen first\nurged the carriers to fall upon Ling and slay him, and then, perceiving\nthat such a course was exceedingly distasteful to their natural\ntendencies, to take up the chair and save him by flight. But Ling in\nthe meantime engaged their attention, and fully explained to them the\ntreacherous and unworthy conduct of Li Keen, showing them how his death\nwould be a just retribution for his ill-spent life, and promising them\neach a considerable reward in addition to their arranged payment when\nthe matter in question had been accomplished. Becoming convinced of the\njustice of Ling's cause, they turned upon Li Keen, insisting that he\nshould at once attempt to carry out the ill-judged threats against Ling,\nof which they were consistent witnesses, and announcing that, if he\nfailed to do so, they would certainly bear him themselves to a not far\ndistant well of stagnant water, and there gain the approbation of the\ngood spirits by freeing the land of so unnatural a monster.\n\nSeeing only a dishonourable death on either side, Li Keen drew his\nsword, and made use of every artifice of which he had knowledge in\norder to disarm Ling or to take him at a disadvantage. In this he was\nunsuccessful, for Ling, who was by nature a very expert sword-user,\nstruck him repeatedly, until he at length fell in an expiring condition,\nremarking with his last words that he had indeed been a narrow-minded\nand extortionate person during his life, and that his death was an\nenlightened act of celestial accuracy.\n\nDirecting Wang and his four hired persons, who had in the meantime\narrived, to give the body of the Mandarin an honourable burial in the\ndeep of the wood, Ling rewarded and dismissed the chairbearers, and\nwithout delay proceeded to Si-chow, where he charitably distributed the\ngoods and possessions of Li Keen among the poor of the town. Having\nin this able and conscientious manner completely proved the misleading\nnature of the disgraceful statements which the Mandarin had spread\nabroad concerning him, Ling turned his footsteps towards Mian, whose\nentrancing joy at his safe return was judged by both persons to be a\nsufficient reward for the mental distress with which their separation\nhad been accompanied.\n\n\n\nXV\n\nAfter the departure of Ling from Canton, the commercial affairs of\nChang-ch'un began, from a secret and undetectable cause, to assume an\nill-regulated condition. No venture which he undertook maintained a\nprofitable attitude, so that many persons who in former times had been\ncontent to display the printed papers setting forth his name and\nvirtues in an easily-seen position in their receiving-rooms, now placed\nthemselves daily before his house in order to accuse him of using their\ntaels in ways which they themselves had not sufficiently understood, and\nfor the purpose of warning passers-by against his inducements. It was\nin vain that Chang proposed new undertakings, each of an infallibly\nmore prosperous nature than those before; the persons who had hitherto\nsupported him were all entrusting their money to one named Pung Soo, who\nrequired millions where Chang had been content with thousands, and who\npersistently insisted on greeting the sacred Emperor as an equal.\n\nIn this unenviable state Chang's mind continually returned to thoughts\nof Ling, whose lifeless body would so opportunely serve to dispel the\nembarrassing perplexities of existence which were settling thickly about\nhim. Urged forward by a variety of circumstances which placed him in\nan entirely different spirit from the honourable bearing which he had\nformerly maintained, he now closely examined all the papers connected\nwith the matter, to discover whether he might not be able to effect his\npurpose with an outward exhibition of law forms. While engaged in this\ndegrading occupation, a detail came to his notice which caused him to\nbecome very amiably disposed and confident of success. Proceeding with\nthe matter, he caused a well-supported report to be spread about that\nLing was suffering from a wasting sickness, which, without in any\nmeasure shortening his life, would cause him to return to the size and\nweight of a newly-born child, and being by these means enabled to secure\nthe entire matter of \"The Ling (After Death) Without Much Risk Assembly\"\nat a very small outlay, he did so, and then, calling together a company\nof those who hire themselves out for purposes of violence, journeyed to\nSi-chow.\n\nLing and Mian were seated together at a table in the great room,\nexamining a vessel of some clear liquid, when Chang-ch'un entered with\nhis armed ones, in direct opposition to the general laws of ordinary\nconduct and the rulings of hospitality. At the sight, which plainly\nindicated a threatened display of violence, Ling seized his renowned\nsword, which was never far distant from him, and prepared to carry out\nhis spoken vow, that any person overstepping a certain mark on the floor\nwould assuredly fall.\n\n\"Put away your undoubtedly competent weapon, O Ling,\" said Chang, who\nwas desirous that the matter should be arranged if possible without any\nloss to himself, \"for such a course can be honourably adopted when it\nis taken into consideration that we are as twenty to one, and have,\nmoreover, the appearance of being inspired by law forms.\"\n\n\"There are certain matters of allowed justice which over-rule all\nother law forms,\" replied Ling, taking a surer hold of his sword-grasp.\n\"Explain, for your part, O obviously double-dealing Chang-ch'un, from\nwhom this person only recently parted on terms of equality and courtesy,\nwhy you come not with an agreeable face and a peaceful following,\nbut with a countenance which indicates both violence and terror, and\naccompanied by many whom this person recognizes as the most outcast and\ndegraded from the narrow and evil-smelling ways of Canton?\"\n\n\"In spite of your blustering words,\" said Chang, with some attempt at an\nexhibition of dignity, \"this person is endowed by every right, and\ncomes only for the obtaining, by the help of this expert and proficient\ngathering, should such a length become necessary, of his just claims.\nUnderstand that in the time since the venture was arranged this person\nhas become possessed of all the property of 'The Ling (After Death)\nWithout Much Risk Assembly,' and thereby he is competent to act fully\nin the matter. It has now come within his attention that the one Ling\nto whom the particulars refer is officially dead, and as the written\nand sealed document clearly undertook that the person's body was to be\ndelivered up for whatever use the Assembly decided whenever death should\npossess it, this person has now come for the honourable carrying out of\nthe undertaking.\"\n\nAt these words the true nature of the hidden contrivance into which he\nhad fallen descended upon Ling like a heavy and unavoidable thunderbolt.\nNevertheless, being by nature and by reason of his late exploits\nfearless of death, except for the sake of the loved one by his side, he\nbetrayed no sign of discreditable emotion at the discovery.\n\n\"In such a case,\" he replied, with an appearance of entirely\ndisregarding the danger of the position, \"the complete parchment must be\nof necessity overthrown; for if this person is now officially dead, he\nwas equally so at the time of sealing, and arrangements entered into by\ndead persons have no actual existence.\"\n\n\"That is a matter which has never been efficiently decided,\" admitted\nChang-ch'un, with no appearance of being thrown into a state of\nconfusion at the suggestion, \"and doubtless the case in question can by\nvarious means be brought in the end before the Court of Final Settlement\nat Peking, where it may indeed be judged in the manner you assert. But\nas such a process must infallibly consume the wealth of a province and\nthe years of an ordinary lifetime, and as it is this person's unmoved\nintention to carry out his own view of the undertaking without delay,\nsuch speculations are not matters of profound interest.\"\n\nUpon this Chang gave certain instructions to his followers, who\nthereupon prepared to advance. Perceiving that the last detail of the\naffair had been arrived at, Ling threw back his hanging garment, and\nwas on the point of rushing forward to meet them, when Mian, who had\nmaintained a possessed and reliant attitude throughout, pushed towards\nhim the vessel of pure and sparkling liquid with which they had been\nengaged when so presumptuously broken in upon, at the same time speaking\nto him certain words in an outside language. A new and Heaven-sent\nconfidence immediately took possession of Ling, and striking his sword\nagainst the wall with such irresistible force that the entire chamber\ntrembled and the feeble-minded assassins shrank back in unrestrained\nterror, he leapt upon the table, grasping in one hand the open vessel.\n\n\"Behold the end, O most uninventive and slow-witted Chang-ch'un!\" he\ncried in a dreadful and awe-compelling voice. \"As a reward for your\nfaithless and traitorous behaviour, learn how such avaricious-minded\nincompetence turns and fastens itself upon the vitals of those who beget\nit. In spite of many things which were not of a graceful nature\ntowards him, this person has unassumingly maintained his part of the\nundertaking, and would have followed such a course conscientiously to\nthe last. As it is, when he has made an end of speaking, the body\nwhich you are already covetously estimating in taels will in no way\nbe distinguishable from that of the meanest and most ordinary maker of\ncommercial ventures in Canton. For, behold! the fluid which he holds in\nhis hand, and which it is his fixed intention to drain to the last drop,\nis in truth nothing but a secret and exceedingly powerful counteractor\nagainst the virtues of the gold drug; and though but a single particle\npassed his lips, and the swords of your brilliant and versatile\nmurderers met the next moment in his breast, the body which fell at your\nfeet would be meet for worms rather than for the melting-pot.\"\n\nIt was indeed such a substance as Ling represented it to be, Mian\nhaving discovered it during her very systematic examination of the dead\nmagician's inner room. Its composition and distillation had involved\nthat self-opinionated person in many years of arduous toil, for with a\nsomewhat unintelligent lack of foresight he had obstinately determined\nto perfect the antidote before he turned his attention to the drug\nitself. Had the matter been more ingeniously arranged, he would\nundoubtedly have enjoyed an earlier triumph and an affluent and\nrespected old age.\n\nAt Ling's earnest words and prepared attitude an instant conviction of\nthe truth of his assertions took possession of Chang. Therefore, seeing\nnothing but immediate and unevadable ruin at the next step, he called\nout in a loud and imploring voice that he should desist, and no harm\nwould come upon him. To this Ling consented, first insisting that the\nfollowers should be dismissed without delay, and Chang alone remain to\nhave conversation on the matter. By this just act the lower parts of\nCanton were greatly purified, for the persons in question being driven\nforth into the woods, mostly perished by encounters with wild animals,\nor at the hands of the enraged villagers, to whom Ling had by this time\nbecome greatly endeared.\n\nWhen the usual state had been restored, Ling made clear to Chang the\naltered nature of the conditions to which he would alone agree. \"It is\na noble-minded and magnanimous proposal on your part, and one to which\nthis misguided person had no claim,\" admitted Chang, as he affixed his\nseal to the written undertaking and committed the former parchment to\nbe consumed by fire. By this arrangement it was agreed that Ling should\nreceive only one-half of the yearly payment which had formerly been\npromised, and that no sum of taels should become due to those depending\non him at his death. In return for these valuable allowances, there were\nto exist no details of things to be done and not to be done, Ling merely\ngiving an honourable promise to observe the matter in a just spirit,\nwhile--most esteemed of all--only a portion of his body was to pass to\nChang when the end arrived, the upper part remaining to embellish the\nfamily altar and receive the veneration of posterity.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the great sky-lantern rose above the trees and the time of no-noise\nfell upon the woods, a flower-laden pleasure-junk moved away from its\nrestraining cords, and, without any sense of motion, gently bore Ling\nand Mian between the sweet-smelling banks of the Heng-Kiang. Presently\nMian drew from beneath her flowing garment an instrument of stringed\nwood, and touching it with a quick but delicate stroke, like the flight\nand pausing of a butterfly, told in well-balanced words a refined\nnarrative of two illustrious and noble-looking persons, and how, after\nmany disagreeable evils and unendurable separations, they entered upon a\ndestined state of earthly prosperity and celestial favour. When she made\nan end of the verses, Ling turned the junk's head by one well-directed\nstroke of the paddle, and prepared by using similar means to return to\nthe place of mooring.\n\n\"Indeed,\" he remarked, ceasing for a moment to continue this skilful\noccupation, \"the words which you have just spoken might, without\ninjustice, be applied to the two persons who are now conversing\ntogether. For after suffering misfortunes and wrongs beyond an\nappropriate portion, they have now reached that period of existence when\na tranquil and contemplative future is assured to them. In this manner\nis the sage and matured utterance of the inspired philosopher Nien-tsu\nagain proved: that the life of every person is largely composed of two\nvarieties of circumstances which together build up his existence--the\nGood and the Evil.\"\n\n                     THE END OF THE STORY OF LING\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nWhen Kai Lung, the story-teller, made an end of speaking, he was\nimmediately greeted with a variety of delicate and pleasing remarks, all\npersons who had witnessed the matter, down even to the lowest type of\nMiaotze, who by reason of their obscure circumstances had been unable to\nunderstand the meaning of a word that had been spoken, maintaining\nthat Kai Lung's accomplishment of continuing for upwards of three hours\nwithout a pause had afforded an entertainment of a very high and refined\norder. While these polished sayings were being composed, together with\nmany others of a similar nature, Lin Yi suddenly leapt to his feet with\na variety of highly objectionable remarks concerning the ancestors of\nall those who were present, and declaring that the story of Ling\nwas merely a well-considered stratagem to cause them to forget the\nexpedition which they had determined upon, for by that time it should\nhave been completely carried out. It was undoubtedly a fact that the\nhour spoken of for the undertaking had long passed, Lin Yi having\ncompletely overlooked the speed of time in his benevolent anxiety that\nthe polite and valorous Ling should in the end attain to a high and\nremunerative destiny.\n\nIn spite of Kai Lung's consistent denials of any treachery, he could not\nbut be aware that the incident tended greatly to his disadvantage in\nthe eyes of those whom he had fixed a desire to conciliate, nor did\nhis well-intentioned offer that he would without hesitation repeat the\ndisplay for a like number of hours effect his amiable purpose. How the\ncomplication would finally have been determined without interruption is\na matter merely of imagination, for at that moment an outpost, who had\nbeen engaged in guarding the secrecy of the expedition, threw himself\ninto the enclosure in a torn and breathless condition, having run\nthrough the forest many li in a winding direction for the explicit\npurpose of warning Lin Yi that his intentions had become known, and that\nhe and his followers would undoubtedly be surprised and overcome if they\nleft the camp.\n\nAt this intimation of the eminent service which Kai Lung had rendered\nthem, the nature of their faces towards him at once changed completely,\nthose who only a moment before had been demanding his death particularly\nhailing him as their inspired and unobtrusive protector, and in all\nprobability, indeed, a virtuous and benignant spirit in disguise.\n\nBending under the weight of offerings which Lin Yi and his followers\npressed upon him, together with many clearly set out desires for his\nfuture prosperity, and assured of their unalterable protection on all\nfuture occasions, Kai Lung again turned his face towards the lanterns\nof Knei Yang. Far down the side of the mountain they followed his\nfootsteps, now by a rolling stone, now by a snapping branch of yellow\npine. Once again they heard his voice, cheerfully repeating to himself;\n\"Among the highest virtues of a pure existence--\" But beyond that point\nthe gentle forest breath bore him away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE STORY OF YUNG CHANG\n\n  Narrated by Kai Lung, in the open space of the tea-shop of The\n  Celestial Principles, at Wu-whei.\n\n\"Ho, illustrious passers-by!\" said Kai Lung, the story-teller, as he\nspread out his embroidered mat under the mulberry-tree. \"It is indeed\nunlikely that you would condescend to stop and listen to the foolish\nwords of such an insignificant and altogether deformed person as myself.\nNevertheless, if you will but retard your elegant footsteps for a few\nmoments, this exceedingly unprepossessing individual will endeavour\nto entertain you with the recital of the adventures of the noble Yung\nChang, as recorded by the celebrated Pe-ku-hi.\"\n\nThus adjured, the more leisurely-minded drew near to hear the history\nof Yung Chang. There was Sing You the fruit-seller, and Li Ton-ti the\nwood-carver; Hi Seng left his clients to cry in vain for water; and Wang\nYu, the idle pipe-maker, closed his shop of \"The Fountain of Beauty,\"\nand hung on the shutter the gilt dragon to keep away customers in his\nabsence. These, together with a few more shopkeepers and a dozen or so\nloafers, constituted a respectable audience by the time Kai Lung was\nready.\n\n\"It would be more seemly if this ill-conditioned person who is now\naddressing such a distinguished assembly were to reward his fine and\nnoble-looking hearers for their trouble,\" apologized the story-teller.\n\"But, as the Book of Verses says, 'The meaner the slave, the greater the\nlord'; and it is, therefore, not unlikely that this majestic concourse\nwill reward the despicable efforts of their servant by handfuls of coins\ntill the air appears as though filled with swarms of locusts in the\nseason of much heat. In particular, there is among this august crowd\nof Mandarins one Wang Yu, who has departed on three previous occasions\nwithout bestowing the reward of a single cash. If the feeble and\ncovetous-minded Wang Yu will place within this very ordinary bowl the\nprice of one of his exceedingly ill-made pipes, this unworthy person\nwill proceed.\"\n\n\"Vast chasms can be filled, but the heart of man never,\" quoted the\npipe-maker in retort. \"Oh, most incapable of story-tellers, have you\nnot on two separate occasions slept beneath my utterly inadequate roof\nwithout payment?\"\n\nBut he, nevertheless, deposited three cash in the bowl, and drew nearer\namong the front row of the listeners.\n\n\"It was during the reign of the enlightened Emperor Tsing Nung,\" began\nKai Lung, without further introduction, \"that there lived at a village\nnear Honan a wealthy and avaricious maker of idols, named Ti Hung. So\nskilful had he become in the making of clay idols that his fame had\nspread for many li round, and idol-sellers from all the neighbouring\nvillages, and even from the towns, came to him for their stock. No other\nidol-maker between Honan and Nanking employed so many clay-gatherers or\nso many modellers; yet, with all his riches, his avarice increased till\nat length he employed men whom he called 'agents' and 'travellers,' who\nwent from house to house selling his idols and extolling his virtues in\nverses composed by the most illustrious poets of the day. He did this\nin order that he might turn into his own pocket the full price of the\nidols, grudging those who would otherwise have sold them the few cash\nwhich they would make. Owing to this he had many enemies, and his army\nof travellers made him still more; for they were more rapacious than\nthe scorpion, and more obstinate than the ox. Indeed, there is still the\nproverb, 'With honey it is possible to soften the heart of the he-goat;\nbut a blow from an iron cleaver is taken as a mark of welcome by an\nagent of Ti Hung.' So that people barred the doors at their approach,\nand even hung out signs of death and mourning.\n\n\"Now, among all his travellers there was none more successful, more\nabandoned, and more valuable to Ti Hung than Li Ting. So depraved was\nLi Ting that he was never known to visit the tombs of his ancestors;\nindeed, it was said that he had been heard to mock their venerable\nmemories, and that he had jestingly offered to sell them to anyone who\nshould chance to be without ancestors of his own. This objectionable\nperson would call at the houses of the most illustrious Mandarins, and\nwould command the slaves to carry to their masters his tablets, on which\nwere inscribed his name and his virtues. Reaching their presence, he\nwould salute them with the greeting of an equal, 'How is your stomach?'\nand then proceed to exhibit samples of his wares, greatly overrating\ntheir value. 'Behold!' he would exclaim, 'is not this elegantly-moulded\nidol worthy of the place of honour in this sumptuous mansion which my\npresence defiles to such an extent that twelve basins of rose-water\nwill not remove the stain? Are not its eyes more delicate than the most\nselect of almonds? and is not its stomach rounder than the cupolas upon\nthe high temple at Peking? Yet, in spite of its perfections, it is not\nworthy of the acceptance of so distinguished a Mandarin, and therefore\nI will accept in return the quarter-tael, which, indeed, is less than my\nillustrious master gives for the clay alone.'\n\n\"In this manner Li Ting disposed of many idols at high rates, and\nthereby endeared himself so much to the avaricious heart of Ti Hung that\nhe promised him his beautiful daughter Ning in marriage.\n\n\"Ning was indeed very lovely. Her eyelashes were like the finest willow\ntwigs that grow in the marshes by the Yang-tse-Kiang; her cheeks were\nfairer than poppies; and when she bathed in the Hoang Ho, her body\nseemed transparent. Her brow was finer than the most polished jade;\nwhile she seemed to walk, like a winged bird, without weight, her hair\nfloating in a cloud. Indeed, she was the most beautiful creature that\nhas ever existed.\"\n\n\"Now may you grow thin and shrivel up like a fallen lemon; but it is\nfalse!\" cried Wang Yu, starting up suddenly and unexpectedly. \"At\nChee Chou, at the shop of 'The Heaven-sent Sugar-cane,' there lives a\nbeautiful and virtuous girl who is more than all that. Her eyes are like\nthe inside circles on the peacock's feathers; her teeth are finer than\nthe scales on the Sacred Dragon; her--\"\n\n\"If it is the wish of this illustriously-endowed gathering that this\nexceedingly illiterate paper tiger should occupy their august moments\nwith a description of the deformities of the very ordinary young person\nat Chee Chou,\" said Kai Lung imperturbably, \"then the remainder of the\nhistory of the noble-minded Yung Chang can remain until an evil fate has\novertaken Wang Yu, as it assuredly will shortly.\"\n\n\"A fair wind raises no storm,\" said Wang Yu sulkily; and Kai Lung\ncontinued:\n\n\"Such loveliness could not escape the evil eye of Li Ting, and\naccordingly, as he grew in favour with Ti Hung, he obtained his consent\nto the drawing up of the marriage contracts. More than this, he had\nalready sent to Ning two bracelets of the finest gold, tied together\nwith a scarlet thread, as a betrothal present. But, as the proverb\nsays, 'The good bee will not touch the faded flower,' and Ning, although\ncompelled by the second of the Five Great Principles to respect her\nfather, was unable to regard the marriage with anything but abhorrence.\nPerhaps this was not altogether the fault of Li Ting, for on the evening\nof the day on which she had received his present, she walked in the\nrice fields, and sitting down at the foot of a funereal cypress, whose\nhighest branches pierced the Middle Air, she cried aloud:\n\n\"'I cannot control my bitterness. Of what use is it that I should be\ncalled the \"White Pigeon among Golden Lilies,\" if my beauty is but for\nthe hog-like eyes of the exceedingly objectionable Li Ting? Ah, Yung\nChang, my unfortunate lover! what evil spirit pursues you that you\ncannot pass your examination for the second degree? My noble-minded but\nambitious boy, why were you not content with an agricultural or even a\nmanufacturing career and happiness? By aspiring to a literary degree,\nyou have placed a barrier wider than the Whang Hai between us.'\n\n\"'As the earth seems small to the soaring swallow, so shall insuperable\nobstacles be overcome by the heart worn smooth with a fixed purpose,'\nsaid a voice beside her, and Yung Chang stepped from behind the cypress\ntree, where he had been waiting for Ning. 'O one more symmetrical than\nthe chrysanthemum,' he continued, 'I shall yet, with the aid of my\nancestors, pass the second degree, and even obtain a position of high\ntrust in the public office at Peking.'\n\n\"'And in the meantime,' pouted Ning, 'I shall have partaken of the\nwedding-cake of the utterly unpresentable Li Ting.' And she exhibited\nthe bracelets which she had that day received.\n\n\"'Alas!' said Yung Chang, 'there are times when one is tempted to doubt\neven the most efficacious and violent means. I had hoped that by this\ntime Li Ting would have come to a sudden and most unseemly end; for I\nhave drawn up and affixed in the most conspicuous places notifications\nof his character, similar to the one here.'\n\n\"Ning turned, and beheld fastened to the trunk of the cypress an\nexceedingly elegantly written and composed notice, which Yung read to\nher as follows:\n\n             \"'BEWARE OF INCURRING DEATH FROM STARVATION\n\n  \"'Let the distinguished inhabitants of this district observe the\n  exceedingly ungraceful walk and bearing of the low person who\n  calls himself Li Ting. Truthfully, it is that of a dog in the act\n  of being dragged to the river because his sores and diseases\n  render him objectionable in the house of his master. So will this\n  hunchbacked person be dragged to the place of execution, and be\n  bowstrung, to the great relief of all who respect the five senses;\n  A Respectful Physiognomy, Passionless Reflexion, Soft Speech,\n  Acute Hearing, Piercing Sight.\n\n  \"'He hopes to attain to the Red Button and the Peacock's Feather;\n  but the right hand of the Deity itches, and Li Ting will assuredly\n  be removed suddenly.'\n\n\"'Li Ting must certainly be in league with the evil forces if he can\nwithstand so powerful a weapon,' said Ning admiringly, when her lover\nhad finished reading. 'Even now he is starting on a journey, nor will he\nreturn till the first day of the month when the sparrows go to the sea\nand are changed into oysters. Perhaps the fate will overtake him while\nhe is away. If not--'\n\n\"'If not,' said Yung, taking up her words as she paused, 'then I have\nyet another hope. A moment ago you were regretting my choice of a\nliterary career. Learn, then, the value of knowledge. By its aid\n(assisted, indeed, by the spirits of my ancestors) I have discovered a\nnew and strange thing, for which I can find no word. By using this new\nsystem of reckoning, your illustrious but exceedingly narrow-minded and\nmiserly father would be able to make five taels where he now makes one.\nWould he not, in consideration for this, consent to receive me as a\nson-in-law, and dismiss the inelegant and unworthy Li Ting?'\n\n\"'In the unlikely event of your being able to convince my illustrious\nparent of what you say, it would assuredly be so,' replied Ning. 'But\nin what way could you do so? My sublime and charitable father already\nemploys all the means in his power to reap the full reward of his sacred\nindustry. His \"solid house-hold gods\" are in reality mere shells of\nclay; higher-priced images are correspondingly constructed, and his clay\ngatherers and modellers are all paid on a \"profit-sharing system.\"\nNay, further, it is beyond likelihood that he should wish for more\npurchasers, for so great is his fame that those who come to buy have\nsometimes to wait for days in consequence of those before them; for my\nexceedingly methodical sire entrusts none with the receiving of money,\nand the exchanges are therefore made slowly. Frequently an unnaturally\ndevout person will require as many as a hundred idols, and so the\ngreater part of the day will be passed.'\n\n\"'In what way?' inquired Yung tremulously.\n\n\"'Why, in order that the countings may not get mixed, of course; it is\nnecessary that when he has paid for one idol he should carry it to a\nplace aside, and then return and pay for the second, carrying it to the\nfirst, and in such a manner to the end. In this way the sun sinks behind\nthe mountains.'\n\n\"'But,' said Yung, his voice thick with his great discovery, 'if he\ncould pay for the entire quantity at once, then it would take but a\nhundredth part of the time, and so more idols could be sold.'\n\n\"'How could this be done?' inquired Ning wonderingly. 'Surely it is\nimpossible to conjecture the value of so many idols.'\n\n\"'To the unlearned it would indeed be impossible,' replied Yung proudly,\n'but by the aid of my literary researches I have been enabled to\ndiscover a process by which such results would be not a matter of\nconjecture, but of certainty. These figures I have committed to tablets,\nwhich I am prepared to give to your mercenary and slow-witted father\nin return for your incomparable hand, a share of the profits, and the\ndismissal of the uninventive and morally threadbare Li Ting.'\n\n\"'When the earth-worm boasts of his elegant wings, the eagle can afford\nto be silent,' said a harsh voice behind them; and turning hastily they\nbeheld Li Ting, who had come upon them unawares. 'Oh, most insignificant\nof table-spoilers,' he continued, 'it is very evident that much\nover-study has softened your usually well-educated brains. Were it\nnot that you are obviously mentally afflicted, I should unhesitatingly\npersuade my beautiful and refined sword to introduce you to the spirits\nof your ignoble ancestors. As it is, I will merely cut off your nose and\nyour left ear, so that people may not say that the Dragon of the Earth\nsleeps and wickedness goes unpunished.'\n\n\"Both had already drawn their swords, and very soon the blows were so\nhard and swift that, in the dusk of the evening, it seemed as though the\nair were filled with innumerable and many-coloured fireworks. Each was\na practised swordsman, and there was no advantage gained on either side,\nwhen Ning, who had fled on the appearance of Li Ting, reappeared, urging\non her father, whose usually leisurely footsteps were quickened by\nthe dread that the duel must surely result in certain loss to himself,\neither of a valuable servant, or of the discovery which Ning had briefly\nexplained to him, and of which he at once saw the value.\n\n\"'Oh, most distinguished and expert persons,' he exclaimed breathlessly,\nas soon as he was within hearing distance, 'do not trouble to give so\nmarvellous an exhibition for the benefit of this unworthy individual,\nwho is the only observer of your illustrious dexterity! Indeed, your\nhonourable condescension so fills this illiterate person with shame that\nhis hearing is thereby preternaturally sharpened, and he can plainly\ndistinguish many voices from beyond the Hoang Ho, crying for the\nHeaven-sent representative of the degraded Ti Hung to bring them more\nidols. Bend, therefore, your refined footsteps in the direction of\nPoo Chow, O Li Ting, and leave me to make myself objectionable to this\nexceptional young man with my intolerable commonplaces.'\n\n\"'The shadow falls in such a direction as the sun wills,' said Li Ting,\nas he replaced his sword and departed.\n\n\"'Yung Chang,' said the merchant, 'I am informed that you have made a\ndiscovery that would be of great value to me, as it undoubtedly would if\nit is all that you say. Let us discuss the matter without ceremony. Can\nyou prove to me that your system possesses the merit you claim for it?\nIf so, then the matter of arrangement will be easy.'\n\n\"'I am convinced of the absolute certainty and accuracy of the\ndiscovery,' replied Yung Chang. 'It is not as though it were an ordinary\nmatter of human intelligence, for this was discovered to me as I was\nworshipping at the tomb of my ancestors. The method is regulated by\na system of squares, triangles, and cubes. But as the practical proof\nmight be long, and as I hesitate to keep your adorable daughter out in\nthe damp night air, may I not call at your inimitable dwelling in the\nmorning, when we can go into the matter thoroughly?'\n\n\"I will not weary this intelligent gathering, each member of which\ndoubtless knows all the books on mathematics off by heart, with a\nrecital of the means by which Yung Chang proved to Ti Hung the accuracy\nof his tables and the value of his discovery of the multiplication\ntable, which till then had been undreamt of,\" continued the\nstory-teller. \"It is sufficient to know that he did so, and that Ti Hung\nagreed to his terms, only stipulating that Li Ting should not be made\naware of his dismissal until he had returned and given in his accounts.\nThe share of the profits that Yung was to receive was cut down very low\nby Ti Hung, but the young man did not mind that, as he would live with\nhis father-in-law for the future.\n\n\"With the introduction of this new system, the business increased like\na river at flood-time. All rivals were left far behind, and Ti Hung put\nout this sign:\n\n                          \"NO WAITING HERE!\n\n  \"Good-morning! Have you worshipped one of Ti Hung's refined\n  ninety-nine cash idols?\n\n  \"Let the purchasers of ill-constructed idols at other\n  establishments, where they have grown old and venerable while\n  waiting for the all-thumb proprietors to count up to ten, come to\n  the shop of Ti Hung and regain their lost youth. Our ninety-nine\n  cash idols are worth a tael a set. We do not, however, claim that\n  they will do everything. The ninety-nine cash idols of Ti Hung\n  will not, for example, purify linen, but even the most contented\n  and frozen-brained person cannot be happy until he possesses one.\n  What is happiness? The exceedingly well-educated Philosopher\n  defines it as the accomplishment of all our desires. Everyone\n  desires one of the Ti Hung's ninety-nine cash idols, therefore get\n  one; but be sure that it is Ti Hung's.\n\n  \"Have you a bad idol? If so, dismiss it, and get one of Ti Hung's\n  ninety-nine cash specimens.\n\n  \"Why does your idol look old sooner than your neighbours? Because\n  yours is not one of Ti Hung's ninety-nine cash marvels.\n\n    \"They bring all delights to the old and the young,\n    The elegant idols supplied by Ti Hung.\n\n  \"N.B.--The 'Great Sacrifice' idol, forty-five cash; delivered,\n  carriage free, in quantities of not less than twelve, at any\n  temple, on the evening before the sacrifice.\n\n\"It was about this time that Li Ting returned. His journey had been more\nthan usually successful, and he was well satisfied in consequence. It\nwas not until he had made out his accounts and handed in his money that\nTi Hung informed him of his agreement with Yung Chang.\n\n\"'Oh, most treacherous and excessively unpopular Ti Hung,' exclaimed\nLi Ting, in a terrible voice, 'this is the return you make for all my\nentrancing efforts in your services, then? It is in this way that you\nreward my exceedingly unconscientious recommendations of your very\ninferior and unendurable clay idols, with their goggle eyes and concave\nstomachs! Before I go, however, I request to be inspired to make the\nfollowing remark--that I confidently predict your ruin. And now this\nlow and undignified person will finally shake the elegant dust of your\ndistinguished house from his thoroughly inadequate feet, and proceed to\noffer his incapable services to the rival establishment over the way.'\n\n\"'The machinations of such an evilly-disposed person as Li Ting will\ncertainly be exceedingly subtle,' said Ti Hung to his son-in-law when\nthe traveller had departed. 'I must counteract his omens. Herewith I\nwish to prophecy that henceforth I shall enjoy an unbroken run of good\nfortune. I have spoken, and assuredly I shall not eat my words.'\n\n\"As the time went on, it seemed as though Ti Hung had indeed spoken\ntruly. The ease and celerity with which he transacted his business\nbrought him customers and dealers from more remote regions than ever,\nfor they could spend days on the journey and still save time. The\narmy of clay-gatherers and modellers grew larger and larger, and the\nwork-sheds stretched almost down to the river's edge. Only one thing\ntroubled Ti Hung, and that was the uncongenial disposition of his\nson-in-law, for Yung took no further interest in the industry to which\nhis discovery had given so great an impetus, but resolutely set to work\nagain to pass his examination for the second degree.\n\n\"'It is an exceedingly distinguished and honourable thing to have failed\nthirty-five times, and still to be undiscouraged,' admitted Ti Hung;\n'but I cannot cleanse my throat from bitterness when I consider that\nmy noble and lucrative business must pass into the hands of strangers,\nperhaps even into the possession of the unendurable Li Ting.'\n\n\"But it had been appointed that this degrading thing should not happen,\nhowever, and it was indeed fortunate that Yung did not abandon his\nliterary pursuits; for after some time it became very apparent to Ti\nHung that there was something radically wrong with his business. It was\nnot that his custom was falling off in any way; indeed, it had lately\nincreased in a manner that was phenomenal, and when the merchant came to\nlook into the matter, he found to his astonishment that the least order\nhe had received in the past week had been for a hundred idols. All the\nsales had been large, and yet Ti Hung found himself most unaccountably\ndeficient in taels. He was puzzled and alarmed, and for the next few\ndays he looked into the business closely. Then it was that the reason\nwas revealed, both for the falling off in the receipts and for the\nincrease in the orders. The calculations of the unfortunate Yung Chang\nwere correct up to a hundred, but at that number he had made a gigantic\nerror--which, however, he was never able to detect and rectify--with\nthe result that all transactions above that point worked out at a\nconsiderable loss to the seller. It was in vain that the panic-stricken\nTi Hung goaded his miserable son-in-law to correct the mistake; it\nwas equally in vain that he tried to stem the current of his enormous\ncommercial popularity. He had competed for public favour, and he had won\nit, and every day his business increased till ruin grasped him by the\npigtail. Then came an order from one firm at Peking for five millions of\nthe ninety-nine cash idols, and at that Ti Hung put up his shutters, and\nsat down in the dust.\n\n\"'Behold!' he exclaimed, 'in the course of a lifetime there are many\nvery disagreeable evils that may overtake a person. He may offend the\nSacred Dragon, and be in consequence reduced to a fine dry powder; or he\nmay incur the displeasure of the benevolent and pure-minded Emperor, and\nbe condemned to death by roasting; he may also be troubled by demons or\nby the disturbed spirits of his ancestors, or be struck by thunderbolts.\nIndeed, there are numerous annoyances, but they become as Heaven-sent\nblessings in comparison to a self-opinionated and more than ordinarily\nweak-minded son-in-law. Of what avail is it that I have habitually\nsold one idol for the value of a hundred? The very objectionable man in\npossession sits in my delectable summer-house, and the unavoidable\nlegal documents settle around me like a flock of pigeons. It is indeed\nnecessary that I should declare myself to be in voluntary liquidation,\nand make an assignment of my book debts for the benefit of my creditors.\nHaving accomplished this, I will proceed to the well-constructed tomb\nof my illustrious ancestors, and having kow-towed at their incomparable\nshrines, I will put an end to my distinguished troubles with this\nexceedingly well-polished sword.'\n\n\"'The wise man can adapt himself to circumstances as water takes the\nshape of the vase that contains it,' said the well-known voice of\nLi Ting. 'Let not the lion and the tiger fight at the bidding of the\njackal. By combining our forces all may be well with you yet. Assist\nme to dispose of the entirely superfluous Yung Chang and to marry\nthe elegant and symmetrical Ning, and in return I will allot to you a\nportion of my not inconsiderable income.'\n\n\"'However high the tree, the leaves fall to the ground, and your hour\nhas come at last, O detestable Li Ting!' said Yung, who had heard the\nspeakers and crept upon them unperceived. 'As for my distinguished\nand immaculate father-in-law, doubtless the heat has affected his\nindefatigable brains, or he would not have listened to your contemptible\nsuggestion. For yourself, draw!'\n\n\"Both swords flashed, but before a blow could be struck the spirits\nof his ancestors hurled Li Ting lifeless to the ground, to avenge the\nmemories that their unworthy descendant had so often reviled.\n\n\"'So perish all the enemies of Yung Chang,' said the victor. 'And now,\nmy venerated but exceedingly short-sighted father-in-law, learn how\nnarrowly you have escaped making yourself exceedingly objectionable\nto yourself. I have just received intelligence from Peking that I have\npassed the second degree, and have in consequence been appointed to a\nremunerative position under the Government. This will enable us to live\nin comfort, if not in affluence, and the rest of your engaging days can\nbe peacefully spent in flying kites.'\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE PROBATION OF SEN HENG\n\n  Related by Kai Lung, at Wu-whei, as a rebuke to Wang Yu and\n  certain others who had questioned the practical value of his\n  stories.\n\n\"It is an undoubted fact that this person has not realized the direct\nremunerative advantage which he confidently anticipated,\" remarked the\nidle and discontented pipe-maker Wang Yu, as, with a few other persons\nof similar inclination, he sat in the shade of the great mulberry tree\nat Wu-whei, waiting for the evil influence of certain very mysterious\nsounds, which had lately been heard, to pass away before he resumed\nhis occupation. \"When the seemingly proficient and trustworthy Kai Lung\nfirst made it his practice to journey to Wu-whei, and narrate to us the\ndoings of persons of all classes of life,\" he continued, \"it seemed to\nthis one that by closely following the recital of how Mandarins obtained\ntheir high position, and exceptionally rich persons their wealth, he\nmust, in the end, inevitably be rendered competent to follow in their\nillustrious footsteps. Yet in how entirely contrary a direction has\nthe whole course of events tended! In spite of the honourable intention\nwhich involved a frequent absence from his place of commerce, those\nwho journeyed thither with the set purpose of possessing one of his\njustly-famed opium pipes so perversely regarded the matter that, after\ntwo or three fruitless visits, they deliberately turned their footsteps\ntowards the workshop of the inelegant Ming-yo, whose pipes are\nconfessedly greatly inferior to those produced by the person who is now\nspeaking. Nevertheless, the rapacious Kai Lung, to whose influence\nthe falling off in custom was thus directly attributable, persistently\ndeclined to bear any share whatever in the loss which his profession\ncaused, and, indeed, regarded the circumstance from so grasping and\nnarrow-minded a point of observation that he would not even go to the\nlength of suffering this much-persecuted one to join the circle of his\nhearers without on every occasion making the customary offering. In this\nmanner a well-intentioned pursuit of riches has insidiously led this\nperson within measurable distance of the bolted dungeon for those who do\nnot meet their just debts, while the only distinction likely to result\nfrom his assiduous study of the customs and methods of those high\nin power is that of being publicly bowstrung as a warning to others.\nManifestedly the pointed finger of the unreliable Kai Lung is a very\ntreacherous guide.\"\n\n\"It is related,\" said a dispassionate voice behind them, \"that a person\nof limited intelligence, on being assured that he would certainly one\nday enjoy an adequate competence if he closely followed the industrious\nhabits of the thrifty bee, spent the greater part of his life in\nanointing his thighs with the yellow powder which he laboriously\ncollected from the flowers of the field. It is not so recorded; but\ndoubtless the nameless one in question was by profession a maker of\nopium pipes, for this person has observed from time to time how that\noccupation, above all others, tends to degrade the mental faculties, and\nto debase its followers to a lower position than that of the beasts of\nlabour. Learn therefrom, O superficial Wang Yu, that wisdom lies in\nan intelligent perception of great principles, and not in a slavish\nimitation of details which are, for the most part, beyond your simple\nand insufficient understanding.\"\n\n\"Such may, indeed, be the case, Kai Lung,\" replied Wang Yu sullenly--for\nit was the story-teller in question who had approached unperceived, and\nwho now stood before them--\"but it is none the less a fact that, on the\nlast occasion when this misguided person joined the attending circle\nat your uplifted voice, a Mandarin of the third degree chanced to\npass through Wu-whei, and halted at the door-step of 'The Fountain of\nBeauty,' fully intending to entrust this one with the designing and\nfashioning of a pipe of exceptional elaborateness. This matter, by his\nabsence, has now passed from him, and to-day, through listening to the\nnarrative of how the accomplished Yuin-Pel doubled his fortune, he is\nthe poorer by many taels.\"\n\n\"Yet to-morrow, when the name of the Mandarin of the third degree\nappears in the list of persons who have transferred their entire\nproperty to those who are nearly related to them in order to avoid it\nbeing seized to satisfy the just claims made against them,\" replied Kai\nLung, \"you will be able to regard yourself the richer by so many taels.\"\n\nAt these words, which recalled to the minds of all who were present the\nnot uncommon manner of behaving observed by those of exalted rank, who\nfreely engaged persons to supply them with costly articles without in\nany way regarding the price to be paid, Wang Yu was silent.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" exclaimed a thin voice from the edge of the group which\nsurrounded Kai Lung, \"it in nowise follows that the stories are in\nthemselves excellent, or of such a nature that the hearing of their\nrecital will profit a person. Wang Yu may be satisfied with empty words,\nbut there are others present who were studying deep matters when Wang\nYu was learning the art of walking. If Kai Lung's stories are of such\nremunerative benefit as the person in question claims, how does it\nchance that Kai Lung himself who is assuredly the best acquainted with\nthem, stands before us in mean apparel, and on all occasions confessing\nan unassuming poverty?\"\n\n\"It is Yan-hi Pung,\" went from mouth to mouth among the\nbystanders--\"Yan-hi Pung, who traces on paper the words of chants and\nhistorical tales, and sells them to such as can afford to buy. And\nalthough his motive in exposing the emptiness of Kai Lung's stories may\nnot be Heaven-sent--inasmuch as Kai Lung provides us with such matter\nas he himself purveys, only at a much more moderate price--yet his words\nare well considered, and must therefore be regarded.\"\n\n\"O Yan-hi Pung,\" replied Kai Lung, hearing the name from those who\nstood about him, and moving towards the aged person, who stood meanwhile\nleaning upon his staff, and looking from side to side with quickly\nmoving eyelids in a manner very offensive towards the story-teller,\n\"your just remark shows you to be a person of exceptional wisdom, even\nas your well-bowed legs prove you to be one of great bodily strength;\nfor justice is ever obvious and wisdom hidden, and they who build\nstructures for endurance discard the straight and upright and insist\nupon such an arch as you so symmetrically exemplify.\"\n\nSpeaking in this conciliatory manner, Kai Lung came up to Yan-hi Pung,\nand taking between his fingers a disc of thick polished crystal,\nwhich the aged and short-sighted chant-writer used for the purpose of\nmagnifying and bringing nearer the letters upon which he was engaged,\nand which hung around his neck by an embroidered cord, the story-teller\nheld it aloft, crying aloud:\n\n\"Observe closely, and presently it will be revealed and made clear how\nthe apparently very conflicting words of the wise Yan-hi Pung, and those\nof this unassuming but nevertheless conscientious person who is now\naddressing you, are, in reality, as one great truth.\"\n\nWith this assurance Kai Lung moved the crystal somewhat, so that it\nengaged the sun's rays, and concentrated them upon the uncovered crown\nof the unsuspecting and still objectionably-engaged person before\nhim. Without a moment's pause, Yan-hi Pung leapt high into the air,\nrepeatedly pressing his hand to the spot thus selected and crying aloud:\n\n\"Evil dragons and thunderbolts! but the touch was as hot as a scar left\nby the uncut nail of the sublime Buddha!\"\n\n\"Yet the crystal--\" remarked Kai Lung composedly, passing it into the\nhands of those who stood near.\n\n\"Is as cool as the innermost leaves of the riverside sycamore,\" they\ndeclared.\n\nKai Lung said nothing further, but raised both his hands above his head,\nas if demanding their judgment. Thereupon a loud shout went up on his\nbehalf, for the greater part of them loved to see the manner in which\nhe brushed aside those who would oppose him; and the sight of the aged\nperson Yan-hi Pung leaping far into the air had caused them to become\nexceptionally amused, and, in consequence, very amiably disposed towards\nthe one who had afforded them the entertainment.\n\n\"The story of Sen Heng,\" began Kai Lung, when the discussion had\nterminated in the manner already recorded, \"concerns itself with one who\npossessed an unsuspecting and ingenious nature, which ill-fitted him\nto take an ordinary part in the everyday affairs of life, no matter how\nengaging such a character rendered him among his friends and relations.\nHaving at an early age been entrusted with a burden of rice and other\nproduce from his father's fields to dispose of in the best possible\nmanner at a neighbouring mart, and having completed the transaction in a\nmanner extremely advantageous to those with whom he trafficked but very\nintolerable to the one who had sent him, it at once became apparent that\nsome other means of gaining a livelihood must be discovered for him.\n\n\"'Beyond all doubt,' said his father, after considering the matter for a\nperiod, 'it is a case in which one should be governed by the wise advice\nand example of the Mandarin Poo-chow.'\n\n\"'Illustrious sire,' exclaimed Sen Heng, who chanced to be present, 'the\nilliterate person who stands before you is entirely unacquainted\nwith the one to whom you have referred; nevertheless, he will, as you\nsuggest, at once set forth, and journeying with all speed to the abode\nof the estimable Poo-chow, solicit his experience and advice.'\n\n\"'Unless a more serious loss should be occasioned,' replied the father\ncoldly, 'there is no necessity to adopt so extreme a course. The\nbenevolent Mandarin in question existed at a remote period of the Thang\ndynasty, and the incident to which an allusion has been made arose in\nthe following way: To the public court of the enlightened Poo-chow there\ncame one day a youth of very inferior appearance and hesitating\nmanner, who besought his explicit advice, saying: \"The degraded and\nunprepossessing being before you, O select and venerable Mandarin, is by\nnature and attainments a person of the utmost timidity and fearfulness.\nFrom this cause life itself has become a detestable observance in his\neyes, for those who should be his companions of both sexes hold him in\nundisguised contempt, making various unendurable allusions to the colour\nand nature of his internal organs whenever he would endeavour to join\nthem. Instruct him, therefore, the manner in which this cowardice may be\nremoved, and no service in return will be esteemed too great.\" \"There\nis a remedy,\" replied the benevolent Mandarin, without any hesitation\nwhatever, \"which if properly carried out is efficacious beyond the\npossibility of failure. Certain component parts of your body are\nlacking, and before the desired result can be obtained these must be\nsupplied from without. Of all courageous things the tiger is the most\nfearless, and in consequence it combines all those ingredients which you\nrequire; furthermore, as the teeth of the tiger are the instruments with\nwhich it accomplishes its vengeful purpose, there reside the essential\nprinciples of its inimitable courage. Let the person who seeks\ninstruction in the matter, therefore, do as follows: taking the teeth of\na full-grown tiger as soon as it is slain, and before the essences\nhave time to return into the body, he shall grind them to a powder, and\nmixing the powder with a portion of rice, consume it. After seven days\nhe must repeat the observance, and yet again a third time, after another\nsimilar lapse. Let him, then, return for further guidance; for the\npresent the matter interests this person no further.\" At these words the\nyouth departed, filled with a new and inspired hope; for the wisdom of\nthe sagacious Poo-chow was a matter which did not admit of any doubt\nwhatever, and he had spoken with well-defined certainty of the success\nof the experiment. Nevertheless, after several days industriously spent\nin endeavouring to obtain by purchase the teeth of a newly-slain tiger,\nthe details of the undertaking began to assume a new and entirely\nunforeseen aspect; for those whom he approached as being the most\nlikely to possess what he required either became very immoderately and\ndisagreeably amused at the nature of the request, or regarded it as a\nnew and ill-judged form of ridicule, which they prepared to avenge by\nblows and by base remarks of the most personal variety. At length it\nbecame unavoidably obvious to the youth that if he was to obtain the\narticles in question it would first be necessary that he should become\nadept in the art of slaying tigers, for in no other way were the\nrequired conditions likely to be present. Although the prospect was one\nwhich did not greatly tend to allure him, yet he did not regard it\nwith the utterly incapable emotions which would have been present on an\nearlier occasion; for the habit of continually guarding himself from\nthe onslaughts of those who received his inquiry in an attitude of\nnarrow-minded distrust had inspired him with a new-found valour, while\nhis amiable and unrestrained manner of life increased his bodily vigour\nin every degree. First perfecting himself in the use of the bow and\narrow, therefore, he betook himself to a wild and very extensive forest,\nand there concealed himself among the upper foliage of a tall tree\nstanding by the side of a pool of water. On the second night of his\nwatch, the youth perceived a large but somewhat ill-conditioned tiger\napproaching the pool for the purpose of quenching its thirst, whereupon\nhe tremblingly fitted an arrow to his bowstring, and profiting by the\ninstruction he had received, succeeded in piercing the creature to\nthe heart. After fulfilling the observance laid upon him by the\ndiscriminating Poo-chow, the youth determined to remain in the forest,\nand sustain himself upon such food as fell to his weapons, until the\ntime arrived when he should carry out the rite for the last time. At the\nend of seven days, so subtle had he become in all kinds of hunting, and\nso strengthened by the meat and herbs upon which he existed, that he\ndisdained to avail himself of the shelter of a tree, but standing openly\nby the side of the water, he engaged the attention of the first tiger\nwhich came to drink, and discharged arrow after arrow into its body with\nunfailing power and precision. So entrancing, indeed, had the pursuit\nbecome that the next seven days lengthened out into the apparent period\nof as many moons, in such a leisurely manner did they rise and fall. On\nthe appointed day, without waiting for the evening to arrive, the youth\nset out with the first appearance of light, and penetrated into the most\ninaccessible jungles, crying aloud words of taunt-laden challenge to all\nthe beasts therein, and accusing the ancestors of their race of every\nimaginable variety of evil behaviour. Yet so great had become the renown\nof the one who stood forth, and so widely had the warning voice been\npassed from tree to tree, preparing all who dwelt in the forest against\nhis anger, that not even the fiercest replied openly, though low growls\nand mutterings proceeded from every cave within a bow-shot's distance\naround. Wearying quickly of such feeble and timorous demonstrations, the\nyouth rushed into the cave from which the loudest murmurs proceeded, and\nthere discovered a tiger of unnatural size, surrounded by the bones of\ninnumerable ones whom it had devoured; for from time to time its\nravages became so great and unbearable, that armies were raised in\nthe neighbouring villages and sent to destroy it, but more than a\nfew stragglers never returned. Plainly recognizing that a just and\ninevitable vengeance had overtaken it, the tiger made only a very\ninferior exhibition of resistance, and the youth, having first stunned\nit with a blow of his closed hand, seized it by the middle, and\nrepeatedly dashed its head against the rocky sides of its retreat. He\nthen performed for the third time the ceremony enjoined by the Mandarin,\nand having cast upon the cringing and despicable forms concealed in the\nsurrounding woods and caves a look of dignified and ineffable contempt,\nset out upon his homeward journey, and in the space of three days' time\nreached the town of the versatile Poo-chow. \"Behold,\" exclaimed that\nperson, when, lifting up his eyes, he saw the youth approaching laden\nwith the skins of the tigers and other spoils, \"now at least the youths\nand maidens of your native village will no longer withdraw themselves\nfrom the company of so undoubtedly heroic a person.\" \"Illustrious\nMandarin,\" replied the other, casting both his weapons and his trophies\nbefore his inspired adviser's feet, \"what has this person to do with the\nlittle ones of either sex? Give him rather the foremost place in your\never-victorious company of bowmen, so that he may repay in part the\nundoubted debt under which he henceforth exists.\" This proposal found\nfavour with the pure-minded Poo-chow, so that in course of time the\nunassuming youth who had come supplicating his advice became the\nvaliant commander of his army, and the one eventually chosen to present\nplighting gifts to his only daughter.'\n\n\"When the father had completed the narrative of how the faint-hearted\nyouth became in the end a courageous and resourceful leader of bowmen,\nSen looked up, and not in any degree understanding the purpose of the\nstory, or why it had been set forth before him, exclaimed:\n\n\"'Undoubtedly the counsel of the graceful and intelligent Mandarin\nPoo-chow was of inestimable service in the case recorded, and this\nperson would gladly adopt it as his guide for the future, on the chance\nof it leading to a similar honourable career; but alas! there are no\ntigers to be found throughout this Province.'\n\n\"'It is a loss which those who are engaged in commerce in the city of\nHankow strive to supply adequately,' replied his father, who had an\nassured feeling that it would be of no avail to endeavour to show\nSen that the story which he had just related was one setting forth a\ndefinite precept rather than fixing an exact manner of behaviour. 'For\nthat reason,' he continued, 'this person has concluded an arrangement by\nwhich you will journey to that place, and there enter into the house of\ncommerce of an expert and conscientious vendor of moving contrivances.\nAmong so rapacious and keen-witted a class of persons as they of Hankow,\nit is exceedingly unlikely that your amiable disposition will involve\nany individual one in an unavoidably serious loss, and even should\nsuch an unforeseen event come to pass, there will, at least, be the\nundeniable satisfaction of the thought that the unfortunate occurrence\nwill in no way affect the prosperity of those to whom you are bound by\nthe natural ties of affection.'\n\n\"'Benevolent and virtuous-minded father,' replied Sen gently, but\nspeaking with an inspired conviction; 'from his earliest infancy this\nunassuming one has been instructed in an inviolable regard for the Five\nGeneral Principles of Fidelity to the Emperor, Respect for Parents,\nHarmony between Husband and Wife, Agreement among Brothers, and\nConstancy in Friendship. It will be entirely unnecessary to inform so\npious-minded a person as the one now being addressed that no evil can\nattend the footsteps of an individual who courteously observes these\nenactments.'\n\n\"'Without doubt it is so arranged by the protecting Deities,' replied\nthe father; 'yet it is an exceedingly desirable thing for those who are\nresponsible in the matter that the footsteps to which reference has been\nmade should not linger in the neighbourhood of the village, but should,\nwith all possible speed, turn in the direction of Hankow.'\n\n\"In this manner it came to pass that Sen Heng set forth on the following\nday, and coming without delay to the great and powerful city of Hankow,\nsought out the house of commerce known as 'The Pure Gilt Dragon of\nExceptional Symmetry,' where the versatile King-y-Yang engaged in the\nentrancing occupation of contriving moving figures, and other devices of\nan ingenious and mirth-provoking character, which he entrusted into the\nhands of numerous persons to sell throughout the Province. From this\ncause, although enjoying a very agreeable recompense from the sale\nof the objects, the greatly perturbed King-y-Yang suffered continual\ninternal misgivings; for the habit of behaving of those whom he\nappointed to go forth in the manner described was such that he could not\nentirely dismiss from his mind an assured conviction that the details\nwere not invariably as they were represented to be. Frequently would\none return in a very deficient and unpresentable condition of garment,\nasserting that on his return, while passing through a lonely and\nunprotected district, he had been assailed by an armed band of robbers,\nand despoiled of all he possessed. Another would claim to have been made\nthe sport of evil spirits, who led him astray by means of false signs\nin the forest, and finally destroyed his entire burden of commodities,\naccompanying the unworthy act by loud cries of triumph and remarks of\nan insulting nature concerning King-y-Yang; for the honourable character\nand charitable actions of the person in question had made him very\nobjectionable to that class of beings. Others continually accounted\nfor the absence of the required number of taels by declaring that at\na certain point of their journey they were made the object of marks\nof amiable condescension on the part of a high and dignified public\nofficial, who, on learning in whose service they were, immediately\nprofessed an intimate personal friendship with the estimable\nKing-y-Yang, and, out of a feeling of gratified respect for him, took\naway all such contrivances as remained undisposed of, promising to\narrange the payment with the refined King-y-Yang himself when they\nshould next meet. For these reasons King-y-Yang was especially desirous\nof obtaining one whose spoken word could be received, upon all points,\nas an assured fact, and it was, therefore, with an emotion of internal\nlightness that he confidently heard from those who were acquainted\nwith the person that Sen Heng was, by nature and endowments, utterly\nincapable of representing matters of even the most insignificant degree\nto be otherwise than what they really were.\n\nFilled with an acute anxiety to discover what amount of success would\nbe accorded to his latest contrivance, King-y-Yang led Sen Heng to a\nsecluded chamber, and there instructed him in the method of selling\ncertain apparently very ingeniously constructed ducks, which would have\nthe appearance of swimming about on the surface of an open vessel of\nwater, at the same time uttering loud and ever-increasing cries, after\nthe manner of their kind. With ill-restrained admiration at the skilful\nnature of the deception, King-y-Yang pointed out that the ducks which\nwere to be disposed of, and upon which a seemingly very low price was\nfixed, did not, in reality, possess any of these accomplishments, but\nwould, on the contrary, if placed in water, at once sink to the bottom\nin a most incapable manner; it being part of Sen's duty to exhibit only\na specially prepared creature which was restrained upon the surface by\nmeans of hidden cords, and, while bending over it, to simulate the cries\nas agreed upon. After satisfying himself that Sen could perform these\nmovements competently, King-y-Yang sent him forth, particularly charging\nhim that he should not return without a sum of money which fully\nrepresented the entire number of ducks entrusted to him, or an adequate\nnumber of unsold ducks to compensate for the deficiency.\n\n\"At the end of seven days Sen returned to King-y-Yang, and although\nentirely without money, even to the extent of being unable to provide\nhimself with the merest necessities of a frugal existence, he honourably\nreturned the full number of ducks with which he had set out. It then\nbecame evident that although Sen had diligently perfected himself in the\nsounds and movements which King-y-Yang had contrived, he had not\nfully understood that they were to be executed stealthily, but had,\nin consequence, manifested the accomplishment openly, not unreasonably\nsupposing that such an exhibition would be an additional inducement to\nthose who appeared to be well-disposed towards the purchase. From this\ncause it came about that although large crowds were attracted by Sen's\nmanner of conducting the enterprise, none actually engaged to purchase\neven the least expensively-valued of the ducks, although several\npublicly complimented Sen on his exceptional proficiency, and repeatedly\nurged him to louder and more frequent cries, suggesting that by such\nmeans possible buyers might be attracted to the spot from remote and\ninaccessible villages in the neighbourhood.\n\n\"When King-y-Yang learned how the venture had been carried out, he\nbecame most intolerably self-opinionated in his expressions towards\nSen's mental attainments and the manner of his bringing up. It was\nentirely in vain that the one referred to pointed out in a tone of\npersuasive and courteous restraint that he had not, down to the most\nminute particulars, transgressed either the general or the specific\nobligations of the Five General Principles, and that, therefore, he was\nblameless, and even worthy of commendation for the manner in which he\nhad acted. With an inelegant absence of all refined feeling, King-y-Yang\nmost incapably declined to discuss the various aspects of the\ncontroversy in an amiable manner, asserting, indeed, that for the\nconsideration of as many brass cash as Sen had mentioned principles\nhe would cause him to be thrown into prison as a person of unnatural\nineptitude. Then, without rewarding Sen for the time spent in his\nservice, or even inviting him to partake of food and wine, the\ninsufferable deviser of very indifferent animated contrivances again\nsent him out, this time into the streets of Hankow with a number of\ndelicately inlaid boxes, remarking in a tone of voice which plainly\nindicated an exactly contrary desire that he would be filled with an\noverwhelming satisfaction if Sen could discover any excuse for returning\na second time without disposing of anything. This remark Sen's ingenuous\nnature led him to regard as a definite fact, so that when a passer-by,\nwho tarried to examine the boxes chanced to remark that the colours\nmight have been arranged to greater advantage, in which case he would\ncertainly have purchased at least one of the articles, Sen hastened\nback, although in a distant part of the city, to inform King-y-Yang of\nthe suggestion, adding that he himself had been favourably impressed\nwith the improvement which could be effected by such an alteration.\n\n\"The nature of King-y-Yang's emotion when Sen again presented himself\nbefore him--and when by repeatedly applied tests on various parts of his\nbody he understood that he was neither the victim of malicious demons,\nnor wandering in an insensible condition in the Middle Air, but that the\ncause of the return was such as had been plainly stated--was of so mixed\nand benumbing a variety, that for a considerable space of time he was\nquite unable to express himself in any way, either by words or by signs.\nBy the time these attributes returned there had formed itself within\nKing-y-Yang's mind a design of most contemptible malignity, which seemed\nto present to his enfeebled intellect a scheme by which Sen would be\nadequately punished, and finally disposed of, without causing him any\nfurther trouble in the matter. For this purpose he concealed the real\ncondition of his sentiments towards Sen, and warmly expressed himself in\nterms of delicate flattery regarding that one's sumptuous and unfailing\ntaste in the matter of the blending of the colours. Without doubt, he\ncontinued, such an alteration as the one proposed would greatly increase\nthe attractiveness of the inlaid boxes, and the matter should be engaged\nupon without delay. In the meantime, however, not to waste the immediate\nservices of so discriminating and persevering a servant, he would\nentrust Sen with a mission of exceptional importance, which would\ncertainly tend greatly to his remunerative benefit. In the district\nof Yun, in the north-western part of the Province, said the crafty\nand treacherous King-y-Yang, a particular kind of insect was greatly\nesteemed on account of the beneficent influence which it exercised over\nthe rice plants, causing them to mature earlier, and to attain a greater\nsize than ever happened in its absence. In recent years this creature\nhad rarely been seen in the neighbourhood of Yun, and, in consequence,\nthe earth-tillers throughout that country had been brought into a most\ndisconcerting state of poverty, and would, inevitably, be prepared to\nexchange whatever they still possessed for even a few of the insects, in\norder that they might liberate them to increase, and so entirely reverse\nthe objectionable state of things. Speaking in this manner, King-y-Yang\nentrusted to Sen a carefully prepared box containing a score of the\ninsects, obtained at a great cost from a country beyond the Bitter\nWater, and after giving him further directions concerning the journey,\nand enjoining the utmost secrecy about the valuable contents of the box,\nhe sent him forth.\n\n\"The discreet and sagacious will already have understood the nature of\nKing-y-Yang's intolerable artifice; but, for the benefit of the amiable\nand unsuspecting, it is necessary to make it clear that the words which\nhe had spoken bore no sort of resemblance to affairs as they really\nexisted. The district around Yun was indeed involved in a most\nunprepossessing destitution, but this had been caused, not by the\nabsence of any rare and auspicious insect, but by the presence of vast\nhordes of locusts, which had overwhelmed and devoured the entire face\nthe country. It so chanced that among the recently constructed devices\nat 'The Pure Gilt Dragon of Exceptional Symmetry' were a number of\nelegant representations of rice fields and fruit gardens so skilfully\nfashioned that they deceived even the creatures, and attracted, among\nother living things, all the locusts in Hankow into that place of\ncommerce. It was a number of these insects that King-y-Yang vindictively\nplaced in the box which he instructed Sen to carry to Yun, well knowing\nthat the reception which would be accorded to anyone who appeared there\non such a mission would be of so fatally destructive a kind that the\nconsideration of his return need not engage a single conjecture.\n\n\"Entirely tranquil in intellect--for the possibility of King-y-Yang's\nintention being in any way other than what he had represented it to\nbe did not arise within Sen's ingenuous mind--the person in question\ncheerfully set forth on his long but unavoidable march towards the\nregion of Yun. As he journeyed along the way, the nature of his\nmeditation brought up before him the events which had taken place since\nhis arrival at Hankow; and, for the first time, it was brought within\nhis understanding that the story of the youth and the three tigers,\nwhich his father had related to him, was in the likeness of a proverb,\nby which counsel and warning is conveyed in a graceful and inoffensive\nmanner. Readily applying the fable to his own condition, he could not\ndoubt but that the first two animals to be overthrown were represented\nby the two undertakings which he had already conscientiously performed\nin the matter of the mechanical ducks and the inlaid boxes, and the\nconviction that he was even then engaged on the third and last trial\nfilled him with an intelligent gladness so unobtrusive and refined that\nhe could express his entrancing emotions in no other way that by lifting\nup his voice and uttering the far-reaching cries which he had used on\nthe first of the occasions just referred to.\n\n\"In this manner the first part of the journey passed away with engaging\ncelerity. Anxious as Sen undoubtedly was to complete the third task, and\napproach the details which, in his own case, would correspond with the\ncommand of the bowmen and the marriage with the Mandarin's daughter of\nthe person in the story, the noontide heat compelled him to rest in the\nshade by the wayside for a lengthy period each day. During one of\nthese pauses it occurred to his versatile mind that the time which was\notherwise uselessly expended might be well disposed of in endeavouring\nto increase the value and condition of the creatures under his care by\ninstructing them in the performance of some simple accomplishments,\nsuch as might not be too laborious for their feeble and immature\nunderstanding. In this he was more successful than he had imagined could\npossibly be the case, for the discriminating insects, from the first,\nhad every appearance of recognizing that Sen was inspired by a sincere\nregard for their ultimate benefit, and was not merely using them for\nhis own advancement. So assiduously did they devote themselves to their\nallotted tasks, that in a very short space of time there was no detail\nin connexion with their own simple domestic arrangements that was not\nunderstood and daily carried out by an appointed band. Entranced at this\nintelligent manner of conducting themselves, Sen industriously applied\nhis time to the more congenial task of instructing them in the refined\narts, and presently he had the enchanting satisfaction of witnessing a\nnumber of the most cultivated faultlessly and unhesitatingly perform a\nportion of the well-known gravity-removing play entitled \"The Benevolent\nOmen of White Dragon Tea Garden; or, Three Times a Mandarin.\" Not even\ncontent with this elevating display, Sen ingeniously contrived, from\nvarious objects which he discovered at different points by the wayside,\nan effective and life-like representation of a war-junk, for which he\ntrained a crew, who, at an agreed signal, would take up their appointed\nplaces and go through the required movements, both of sailing, and of\ndischarging the guns, in a reliable and efficient manner.\n\n\"As Sen was one day educating the least competent of the insects in the\nsimpler parts of banner-carriers, gong-beaters, and the like, to their\nmore graceful and versatile companions, he lifted up his eyes and\nbeheld, standing by his side, a person of very elaborately embroidered\napparel and commanding personality, who had all the appearance of one\nwho had been observing his movements for some space of time. Calling\nup within his remembrance the warning which he had received from\nKing-y-Yang, Sen was preparing to restore the creatures to their closed\nbox, when the stranger, in a loud and dignified voice, commanded him to\nrefrain, adding:\n\n\"'There is, resting at a spot within the immediate neighbourhood,\na person of illustrious name and ancestry, who would doubtless be\ngratified to witness the diverting actions of which this one has\nrecently been a spectator. As the reward of a tael cannot be unwelcome\nto a person of your inferior appearance and unpresentable garments, take\nup your box without delay, and follow the one who is now before you.'\n\n\"With these words the richly-clad stranger led the way through a narrow\nwoodland path, closely followed by Sen, to whom the attraction of the\npromised reward--a larger sum, indeed, than he had ever possessed--was\nsufficiently alluring to make him determined that the other should not,\nfor the briefest possible moment, pass beyond his sight.\n\n\"Not to withhold that which Sen was entirely ignorant of until a later\nperiod, it is now revealed that the person in question was the official\nProvider of Diversions and Pleasurable Occupations to the sacred\nand illimitable Emperor, who was then engaged in making an unusually\nextensive march through the eight Provinces surrounding his Capital--for\nthe acute and well-educated will not need to be reminded that Nanking\noccupied that position at the time now engaged with. Until his\nprovidential discovery of Sen, the distinguished Provider had been\nimmersed in a most unenviable condition of despair, for his enlightened\nbut exceedingly perverse-minded master had, of late, declined to be\nin any way amused, or even interested, by the simple and unpretentious\nentertainment which could be obtained in so inaccessible a region. The\nwell-intentioned efforts of the followers of the Court, who engagingly\nendeavoured to divert the Imperial mind by performing certain feats\nwhich they remembered to have witnessed on previous occasions, but\nwhich, until the necessity arose, they had never essayed, were entirely\nwithout result of a beneficial order. Even the accomplished Provider's\none attainment--that of striking together both the hands and the feet\nthrice simultaneously, while leaping into the air, and at the same time\nproducing a sound not unlike that emitted by a large and vigorous bee\nwhen held captive in the fold of a robe, an action which never failed\nto throw the illustrious Emperor into a most uncontrollable state of\namusement when performed within the Imperial Palace--now only drew\nfrom him the unsympathetic, if not actually offensive, remark that the\nattitude and the noise bore a marked resemblance to those produced by a\nperson when being bowstrung, adding, with unprepossessing significance,\nthat of the two entertainments he had an unevadable conviction that the\nbowstringing would be the more acceptable and gravity-removing.\n\n\"When Sen beheld the size and the silk-hung magnificence of the camp\ninto which his guide led him, he was filled with astonishment, and at\nthe same time recognized that he had acted in an injudicious and hasty\nmanner by so readily accepting the offer of a tael; whereas, if he had\nbeen in possession of the true facts of the case, as they now appeared,\nhe would certainly have endeavoured to obtain double that amount before\nconsenting. As he was hesitating within himself whether the matter might\nnot even yet be arranged in a more advantageous manner, he was suddenly\nled forward into the most striking and ornamental of the tents, and\ncommanded to engage the attention of the one in whose presence he found\nhimself, without delay.\n\n\"From the first moment when the inimitable creatures began, at Sen's\nspoken word, to go through the ordinary details of their domestic\naffairs, there was no sort of doubt as to the nature of the success with\nwhich their well-trained exertions would be received. The dark shadows\ninstantly forsook the enraptured Emperor's select brow, and from time\nto time he expressed himself in words of most unrestrained and intimate\nencouragement. So exuberant became the overjoyed Provider's emotion at\nhaving at length succeeded in obtaining the services of one who was\nable to recall his Imperial master's unclouded countenance, that he came\nforward in a most unpresentable state of haste, and rose into the air\nuncommanded, for the display of his usually not unwelcome acquirement.\nThis he would doubtless have executed competently had not Sen, who stood\nimmediately behind him, suddenly and unexpectedly raised his voice in\na very vigorous and proficient duck cry, thereby causing the one before\nhim to endeavour to turn around in alarm, while yet in the air--an\nintermingled state of movements of both the body and the mind that\ncaused him to abandon his original intention in a manner which removed\nthe gravity of the Emperor to an even more pronounced degree than had\nbeen effected by the diverting attitudes of the insects.\n\n\"When the gratified Emperor had beheld every portion of the tasks\nwhich Sen had instilled into the minds of the insects, down even to the\nminutest detail, he called the well-satisfied Provider before him,\nand addressing him in a voice which might be designed to betray either\nsternness or an amiable indulgence, said:\n\n\"'You, O Shan-se, are reported to be a person of no particular intellect\nor discernment, and, for this reason, these ones who are speaking have a\ndesire to know how the matter will present itself in your eyes. Which\nis it the more commendable and honourable for a person to train to\na condition of unfailing excellence, human beings of confessed\nintelligence or insects of a low and degraded standard?'\n\n\"To this remark the discriminating Shan-se made no reply, being, indeed,\nundecided in his mind whether such a course was expected of him. On\nseveral previous occasions the somewhat introspective Emperor had\naddressed himself to persons in what they judged to be the form of a\nquestion, as one might say, 'How blue is the unapproachable air canopy,\nand how delicately imagined the colour of the clouds!' yet when they had\nexpressed their deliberate opinion on the subjects referred to,\nstating the exact degree of blueness, and the like, the nature of\ntheir reception ever afterwards was such that, for the future, persons\nendeavoured to determine exactly the intention of the Emperor's mind\nbefore declaring themselves in words. Being exceedingly doubtful on this\noccasion, therefore, the very cautious Shan-se adopted the more prudent\nand uncompromising attitude, and smiling acquiescently, he raised both\nhis hands with a self-deprecatory movement.\n\n\"'Alas!' exclaimed the Emperor, in a tone which plainly indicated that\nthe evasive Shan-se had adopted a course which did not commend itself,\n'how unendurable a condition of affairs is it for a person of acute\nmental perception to be annoyed by the inopportune behaviour of one\nwho is only fit to mix on terms of equality with beggars, and low-caste\nstreet cleaners--'\n\n\"'Such a condition of affairs is indeed most offensively unbearable,\nillustrious Being,' remarked Shan-se, who clearly perceived that his\nformer silence had not been productive of a delicate state of feeling\ntowards himself.\n\n\"'It has frequently been said,' continued the courteous and pure-minded\nEmperor, only signifying his refined displeasure at Shan-se's really\nill-considered observation by so arranging his position that the person\nin question on longer enjoyed the sublime distinction of gazing upon his\nbenevolent face, 'that titles and offices have been accorded, from time\nto time, without any regard for the fitting qualifications of those to\nwhom they were presented. The truth that such a state of things does\noccasionally exist has been brought before our eyes during the past\nfew days by the abandoned and inefficient behaviour of one who will\nhenceforth be a marked official; yet it has always been our endeavour\nto reward expert and unassuming merit, whenever it is discovered. As\nwe were setting forth, when we were interrupted in a most obstinate and\nsuperfluous manner, the one who can guide and cultivate the minds of\nunthinking, and not infrequently obstinate and rapacious, insects would\ncertainly enjoy an even greater measure of success if entrusted with the\ndiscriminating intellects of human beings. For this reason it appears\nthat no more fitting person could be found to occupy the important and\nwell-rewarded position of Chief Arranger of the Competitive Examinations\nthan the one before us--provided his opinions and manner of expressing\nhimself are such as commend themselves to us. To satisfy us on this\npoint let Sen Heng now stand forth and declare his beliefs.'\n\n\"On this invitation Sen advanced the requisite number of paces, and not\nin any degree understanding what was required of him, determined that\nthe occasion was one when he might fittingly declare the Five General\nPrinciples which were ever present in his mind. 'Unquestioning Fidelity\nto the Sacred Emperor--' he began, when the person in question signified\nthat the trial was over.\n\n\"'After so competent and inspired an expression as that which has just\nbeen uttered, which, if rightly considered, includes all lesser things,\nit is unnecessary to say more,' he declared affably. 'The appointment\nwhich has already been specified is now declared to be legally\nconferred. The evening will be devoted to a repetition of the entrancing\nmanoeuvres performed by the insects, to be followed by a feast and music\nin honour of the recognized worth and position of the accomplished Sen\nHeng. There is really no necessity for the apparently over-fatigued\nShan-se to attend the festival.'\n\n\"In such a manner was the foundation of Sen's ultimate prosperity\nestablished, by which he came in the process of time to occupy a very\nhigh place in public esteem. Yet, being a person of honourably-minded\nconscientiousness, he did not hesitate, when questioned by those who\nmade pilgrimages to him for the purpose of learning by what means he\nhad risen to so remunerative a position, to ascribe his success, not\nentirely to his own intelligent perception of persons and events, but,\nin part, also to a never-failing regard for the dictates of the Five\nGeneral Principles, and a discriminating subservience to the inspired\nwisdom of the venerable Poo-chow, as conveyed to him in the story of\nthe faint-hearted youth and the three tigers. This story Sen furthermore\ncaused to be inscribed in letters of gold, and displayed in a prominent\nposition in his native village, where it has since doubtless been the\nmeans of instructing and advancing countless observant ones who have not\nbeen too insufferable to be guided by the experience of those who have\ngone before.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE EXPERIMENT OF THE MANDARIN CHAN HUNG\n\n  Related by Kai Lung at Shan Tzu, on the occasion of his receiving\n  a very unexpected reward.\n\n\"There are certainly many occasions when the principles of the Mandarin\nChan Hung appear to find practical favour in the eyes of those who form\nthis usually uncomplaining person's audiences at Shan Tzu,\" remarked Kai\nLung, with patient resignation, as he took up his collecting-bowl and\ntransferred the few brass coins which it held to a concealed place among\nhis garments. \"Has the village lately suffered from a visit of one\nof those persons who come armed with authority to remove by force or\nstratagem such goods as bear names other than those possessed by their\nholders? or is it, indeed--as they of Wu-whei confidently assert--that\nwhen the Day of Vows arrives the people of Shan Tzu, with one accord,\nundertake to deny themselves in the matter of gifts and free offerings,\nin spite of every conflicting impulse?\"\n\n\"They of Wu-whei!\" exclaimed a self-opinionated bystander, who had\nby some means obtained an inferior public office, and who was, in\nconsequence, enabled to be present on all occasions without contributing\nany offering. \"Well is that village named 'The Refuge of Unworthiness,'\nfor its dwellers do little but rob and illtreat strangers, and spread\nevil and lying reports concerning better endowed ones than themselves.\"\n\n\"Such a condition of affairs may exist,\" replied Kai Lung, without\nany indication of concern either one way or the other; \"yet it is an\nundeniable fact that they reward this commonplace story-teller's too\noften underestimated efforts in a manner which betrays them either to\nbe of noble birth, or very desirous of putting to shame their less\nprosperous neighbouring places.\"\n\n\"Such exhibitions of uncalled-for lavishness are merely the signs of an\nill-regulated and inordinate vanity,\" remarked a Mandarin of the eighth\ngrade, who chanced to be passing, and who stopped to listen to Kai\nLung's words. \"Nevertheless, it is not fitting that a collection of\ndecaying hovels, which Wu-whei assuredly is, should, in however small\na detail, appear to rise above Shan Tzu, so that if the versatile and\nunassuming Kai Lung will again honour this assembly by allowing his\nwell-constructed bowl to pass freely to and fro, this obscure and\notherwise entirely superfluous individual will make it his especial care\nthat the brass of Wu-whei shall be answered with solid copper, and its\ndebased pewter with doubly refined silver.\"\n\nWith these encouraging words the very opportune Mandarin of the eighth\ngrade himself followed the story-teller's collecting-bowl, observing\nclosely what each person contributed, so that, although he gave nothing\nfrom his own store, Kai Lung had never before received so honourable an\namount.\n\n\"O illustrious Kai Lung,\" exclaimed a very industrious and ill-clad\nherb-gatherer, who, in spite of his poverty, could not refrain from\nmingling with listeners whenever the story-teller appeared in Shan Tzu,\n\"a single piece of brass money is to this person more than a block\nof solid gold to many of Wu-whei; yet he has twice made the customary\noffering, once freely, once because a courteous and pure-minded\nindividual who possesses certain written papers of his connected with\nthe repayment of some few taels walked behind the bowl and engaged\nhis eyes with an unmistakable and very significant glance. This fact\nemboldens him to make the following petition: that in place of the not\naltogether unknown story of Yung Chang which had been announced the\nproficient and nimble-minded Kai Lung will entice our attention with the\nhistory of the Mandarin Chan Hung, to which reference has already been\nmade.\"\n\n\"The occasion is undoubtedly one which calls for recognition to an\nunusual degree,\" replied Kai Lung with extreme affability. \"To that end\nthis person will accordingly narrate the story which has been suggested,\nnotwithstanding the fact that it has been specially prepared for\nthe ears of the sublime Emperor, who is at this moment awaiting this\nunseemly one's arrival in Peking with every mark of ill-restrained\nimpatience, tempered only by his expectation of being the first to hear\nthe story of the well-meaning but somewhat premature Chan Hung.\n\n\"The Mandarin in question lived during the reign of the accomplished\nEmperor Tsint-Sin, his Yamen being at Fow Hou, in the Province of\nShan-Tung, of which place he was consequently the chief official. In his\nconscientious desire to administer a pure and beneficent rule, he not\ninfrequently made himself a very prominent object for public disregard,\nespecially by his attempts to introduce untried things, when from\ntime to time such matters arose within his mind and seemed to promise\nagreeable and remunerative results. In this manner it came about that\nthe streets of Fow Hou were covered with large flat stones, to the great\ninconvenience of those persons who had, from a very remote period, been\nin the habit of passing the night on the soft clay which at all\nseasons of the year afforded a pleasant and efficient resting-place.\nNevertheless, in certain matters his engaging efforts were attended by\nan obvious success. Having noticed that misfortunes and losses are much\nless keenly felt when they immediately follow in the steps of an earlier\nevil, the benevolent and humane-minded Chan Hung devised an ingenious\nmethod of lightening the burden of a necessary taxation by arranging\nthat those persons who were the most heavily involved should be made the\nvictims of an attack and robbery on the night before the matter became\ndue. By this thoughtful expedient the unpleasant duty of parting from so\nmany taels was almost imperceptibly led up to, and when, after the lapse\nof some slight period, the first sums of money were secretly returned,\nwith a written proverb appropriate to the occasion, the public rejoicing\nof those who, had the matter been left to its natural course,\nwould still have been filling the air with bitter and unendurable\nlamentations, plainly testified to the inspired wisdom of the\nenlightened Mandarin.\n\n\"The well-merited success of this amiable expedient caused the Mandarin\nChan Hung every variety of intelligent emotion, and no day passed\nwithout him devoting a portion of his time to the labour of discovering\nother advantages of a similar nature. Engrossed in deep and very sublime\nthought of this order, he chanced upon a certain day to be journeying\nthrough Fow Hou, when he met a person of irregular intellect, who\nmade an uncertain livelihood by following the unassuming and\ncharitably-disposed from place to place, chanting in a loud voice set\nverses recording their virtues, which he composed in their honour. On\naccount of his undoubted infirmities this person was permitted a greater\nfreedom of speech with those above him than would have been the case had\nhis condition been merely ordinary; so that when Chan Hung observed him\nbecoming very grossly amused on his approach, to such an extent indeed,\nthat he neglected to perform any of the fitting acts of obeisance,\nthe wise and noble-minded Mandarin did not in any degree suffer his\ncomplacency to be affected, but, drawing near, addressed him in a calm\nand dignified manner.\n\n\"'Why, O Ming-hi,' he said, 'do you permit your gravity to be removed\nto such an exaggerated degree at the sight of this in no way striking\nor exceptional person? and why, indeed, do you stand in so unbecoming\nan attitude in the presence of one who, in spite of his depraved\ninferiority, is unquestionably your official superior, and could,\nwithout any hesitation, condemn you to the tortures or even to\nbowstringing on the spot?'\n\n\"'Mandarin,' exclaimed Ming-hi, stepping up to Chan Hung, and, without\nany hesitation, pressing the gilt button which adorned the official's\nbody garment, accompanying the action by a continuous muffled noise\nwhich suggested the repeated striking of a hidden bell, 'you wonder that\nthis person stands erect on your approach, neither rolling his lowered\nhead repeatedly from side to side, nor tracing circles in the dust\nof Fow Hou with his submissive stomach? Know then, the meaning of the\nproverb, \"Distrust an inordinate appearance of servility. The estimable\nperson who retires from your presence walking backwards may adopt that\ndeferential manner in order to keep concealed the long double-edged\nknife with which he had hoped to slay you.\" The excessive amusement that\nseized this offensive person when he beheld your well-defined figure in\nthe distance arose from his perception of your internal satisfaction,\nwhich is, indeed, unmistakably reflected in your symmetrical\ncountenance. For, O Mandarin, in spite of your honourable endeavours\nto turn things which are devious into a straight line, the matters upon\nwhich you engage your versatile intellect--little as you suspect the\nfact--are as grains of the finest Foo-chow sand in comparison with that\nwhich escapes your attention.'\n\n\"'Strange are your words, O Ming-hi, and dark to this person your\nmeaning,' replied Chan Hung, whose feelings were evenly balanced between\na desire to know what thing he had neglected and a fear that his dignity\nmight suffer if he were observed to remain long conversing with a person\nof Ming-hi's low mental attainments. 'Without delay, and with an entire\nabsence of lengthy and ornamental forms of speech, express the omission\nto which you have made reference; for this person has an uneasy inside\nemotion that you are merely endeavouring to engage his attention to\nthe end that you may make an unseemly and irrelevant reply, and thereby\ninvolve him in an undeserved ridicule.'\n\n\"'Such a device would be the pastime of one of immature years, and could\nhave no place in this person's habit of conduct,' replied Ming-hi, with\nevery appearance of a fixed sincerity. 'Moreover, the matter is one\nwhich touches his own welfare closely, and, expressed in the fashion\nwhich the proficient Mandarin has commanded, may be set forth as\nfollows: By a wise and all-knowing divine system, it is arranged that\ncertain honourable occupations, which by their nature cannot become\nremunerative to any marked degree, shall be singled out for special\nmarks of reverence, so that those who engage therein may be compensated\nin dignity for what they must inevitably lack in taels. By this\nrefined dispensation the literary occupations, which are in general the\nhighroads to the Establishment of Public Support and Uniform Apparel,\nare held in the highest veneration. Agriculture, from which it is\npossible to wrest a competency, follows in esteem; while the various\nbranches of commerce, leading as they do to vast possessions and the\nattendant luxury, are very justly deprived of all the attributes\nof dignity and respect. Yet observe, O justice-loving Mandarin, how\nunbecomingly this ingenious system of universal compensation has been\ndebased at the instance of grasping and avaricious ones. Dignity, riches\nand ease now go hand in hand, and the highest rewarded in all matters\nare also the most esteemed, whereas, if the discriminating provision of\nthose who have gone before and so arranged it was observed, the direct\ncontrary would be the case.'\n\n\"'It is a state of things which is somewhat difficult to imagine in\ngeneral matters of life, in spite of the fair-seemingness of your\nwords,' said the Mandarin thoughtfully; 'nor can this rather obtuse and\nslow-witted person fully grasp the practical application of the system\non the edge of the moment. In what manner would it operate in the case\nof ordinary persons, for example?'\n\n\"'There should be a fixed and settled arrangement that the low-minded\nand degrading occupations--such as that of following charitable persons\nfrom place to place, chanting verses composed in their honour, that of\nmisleading travellers who inquire the way, so that they fall into the\nhands of robbers, and the like callings--should be the most highly\nrewarded to the end that those who are engaged therein may obtain\nsome solace for the loss of dignity they experience, and the mean\nintellectual position which they are compelled to maintain. By this\ndevice they would be enabled to possess certain advantages and degrees\nof comfort which at present are utterly beyond their grasp, so that in\nthe end they would escape being entirely debased. To turn to the other\nfoot, those who are now high in position, and engaged in professions\nwhich enjoy the confidence of all persons, have that which in itself is\nsufficient to insure contentment. Furthermore, the most proficient\nand engaging in every department, mean or high-minded, have certain\nattributes of respect among those beneath them, so that they might\njustly be content with the lowest reward in whatever calling they\nprofessed, the least skilful and most left-handed being compensated for\nthe mental anguish which they must undoubtedly suffer by receiving the\ngreatest number of taels.'\n\n\"'Such a scheme would, as far as the matter has been expressed, appear\nto possess all the claims of respect, and to be, indeed, what was\noriginally intended by those who framed the essentials of existence,'\nsaid Chan Hung, when he had for some space of time considered the\ndetails. 'In one point, however, this person fails to perceive how\nthe arrangement could be amiably conducted in Fow Hou. The one who\nis addressing you maintains, as a matter of right, a position of\nexceptional respect, nor, if he must express himself upon such a detail,\nare his excessively fatiguing duties entirely unremunerative...'\n\n\"'In the case of the distinguished and unalterable Mandarin,' exclaimed\nMing-hi, with no appearance of hesitation, 'the matter would of\nnecessity be arranged otherwise. Being from that time, as it were, the\ncontroller of the destinies and remunerations of all those in Fow Hou,\nhe would, manifestly, be outside the working of the scheme; standing\napart and regulating, like the person who turns the handle of the\ncorn-mill, but does not suffer himself to be drawn between the\nstones, he could still maintain both his respect and his remuneration\nunaltered.'\n\n\"'If the detail could honourably be regarded in such a light,' said Chan\nHung, 'this person would, without delay, so rearrange matters in Fow\nHou, and thereby create universal justice and an unceasing contentment\nwithin the minds of all.'\n\n\"'Undoubtedly such a course could be justly followed,' assented Ming-hi,\n'for in precisely that manner of working was the complete scheme\nrevealed to this highly-favoured person.'\n\n\"Entirely wrapped up in thoughts concerning the inception and manner of\noperation of this project Chan Hung began to retrace his steps towards\nthe Yamen, failing to observe in his benevolent abstraction of mind,\nthat the unaffectedly depraved person Ming-hi was stretching out his\nfeet towards him and indulging in every other form of low-minded and\nundignified contempt.\n\n\"Before he reached the door of his residence the Mandarin overtook\none who occupied a high position of confidence and remuneration in the\nDepartment of Public Fireworks and Coloured Lights. Fully assured of\nthis versatile person's enthusiasm on behalf of so humane and charitable\na device, Chan Hung explained the entire matter to him without delay,\nand expressly desired that if there were any details which appeared\ncapable of improvement, he would declare himself clearly regarding them.\n\n\"'Alas!' exclaimed the person with whom the Mandarin was conversing,\nspeaking in so unfeignedly disturbed and terrified a voice that several\nwho were passing by stopped in order to learn the full circumstance,\n'have this person's ears been made the object of some unnaturally\nlight-minded demon's ill-disposed pastime, or does the usually\nwell-balanced Chan Hung in reality contemplate so violent and un-Chinese\nan action? What but evil could arise from a single word of the change\nwhich he proposes to the extent of a full written book? The entire fixed\nnature of events would become reversed; persons would no longer be fully\naccountable to one another; and Fow Hou being thus thrown into a most\nunendurable state of confusion, the protecting Deities would doubtless\nwithdraw their influence, and the entire region would soon be given over\nto the malicious guardianship of rapacious and evilly-disposed spirits.\nLet this person entreat the almost invariably clear-sighted Chan Hung\nto return at once to his adequately equipped and sumptuous Yamen, and\nbarring well the door of his inner chamber, so that it can only be\nopened from the outside, partake of several sleeping essences of unusual\nstrength, after which he will awake in an undoubtedly refreshed state\nof mind, and in a condition to observe matters with his accustomed\ndiamond-like penetration.'\n\n\"'By no means!' cried one of those who had stopped to learn the occasion\nof the incident--a very inferior maker of unserviceable imitation\npigtails--'the devout and conscientious-minded Mandarin Chan Hung speaks\nas the inspired mouth-piece of the omnipotent Buddha, and must, for\nthat reason, be obeyed in every detail. This person would unhesitatingly\ncounsel the now invaluable Mandarin to proceed to his well-constructed\nresidence without delay, and there calling together his entire staff of\nthose who set down his spoken words, put the complete Heaven-sent\nplan into operation, and beyond recall, before he retires to his inner\nchamber.'\n\n\"Upon this there arose a most inelegant display of undignified emotions\non the part of the assembly which had by this time gathered together.\nWhile those who occupied honourable and remunerative positions very\nearnestly entreated the Mandarin to act in the manner which had been\nsuggested by the first speaker, others--who had, in the meantime, made\nuse of imagined figures, and thereby discovered that the proposed change\nwould be greatly to their advantage--raised shouts of encouragement\ntowards the proposal of the pigtail-maker, urging the noble Mandarin not\nto become small in the face towards the insignificant few who were ever\nopposed to enlightened reform, but to maintain an unflaccid upper lip,\nand carry the entire matter through to its destined end. In the course\nof this very unseemly tumult, which soon involved all persons present\nin hostile demonstrations towards each other, both the Mandarin and\nthe official from the Fireworks and Coloured Lights Department found\nan opportunity to pass away secretly, the former to consider well the\nvarious sides of the matter, towards which he became better disposed\nwith every thought, the latter to find a purchaser of his appointment\nand leave Fow Hou before the likelihood of Chan Hung's scheme became\ngenerally known.\n\n\"At this point an earlier circumstance, which affected the future\nunrolling of events to no insignificant degree, must be made known,\nconcerning as it does Lila, the fair and very accomplished daughter\nof Chan Hung. Possessing no son or heir to succeed him, the Mandarin\nexhibited towards Lila a very unusual depth of affection, so marked,\nindeed, that when certain evil-minded ones endeavoured to encompass\nhis degradation, on the plea of eccentricity of character, the written\npapers which they dispatched to the high ones at Peking contained no\nother accusation in support of the contention than that the individual\nin question regarded his daughter with an obvious pride and pleasure\nwhich no person of well-balanced intellect lavished on any but a son.\n\n\"It was his really conscientious desire to establish Lila's welfare\nabove all things that had caused Chan Hung to become in some degree\nundecided when conversing with Ming-hi on the detail of the scheme; for,\nunaffected as the Mandarin himself would have been at the prospect of\nan honourable poverty, it was no part of his intention that the adorable\nand exceptionally-refined Lila should be drawn into such an existence.\nThat, indeed, had been the essential of his reply on a certain and not\nfar removed occasion, when two persons of widely differing positions\nhad each made a formal request that he might be allowed to present\nmarriage-pledging gifts to the very desirable Lila. Maintaining an\nenlightened openness of mind upon the subject, the Mandarin had replied\nthat nothing but the merit of undoubted suitableness of a person would\naffect him in such a decision. As it was ordained by the wise and\nunchanging Deities that merit should always be fittingly rewarded,\nhe went on to express himself, and as the most suitable person was\nobviously the one who could the most agreeably provide for her, the\ntwo circumstances inevitably tended to the decision that the one chosen\nshould be the person who could amass the greatest number of taels. To\nthis end he instructed them both to present themselves at the end of\na year, bringing with them the entire profits of their undertakings\nbetween the two periods.\n\n\"This deliberate pronouncement affected the two persons in question in\nan entirely opposite manner, for one of them was little removed from a\ncondition of incessant and most uninviting poverty, while the other was\nthe very highly-rewarded picture-maker Pe-tsing. Both to this latter\nperson, and to the other one, Lee Sing, the ultimate conclusion of the\nmatter did not seem to be a question of any conjecture therefore, and,\nin consequence, the one became most offensively self-confident, and\nthe other leaden-minded to an equal degree, neither remembering the\nunswerving wisdom of the proverb, 'Wait! all men are but as the black,\nhorn-cased beetles which overrun the inferior cooking-rooms of the city,\nand even at this moment the heavily-shod and unerring foot of Buddha may\nbe lifted.'\n\n\"Lee Sing was, by profession, one of those who hunt and ensnare the\nbrilliantly-coloured winged insects which are to be found in various\nparts of the Empire in great variety and abundance, it being his duty\nto send a certain number every year to Peking to contribute to the\namusement of the dignified Emperor. In spite of the not too intelligent\nnature of the occupation, Lee Sing took an honourable pride in all\nmatters connected with it. He disdained, with well-expressed contempt,\nto avail himself of the stealthy and somewhat deceptive methods employed\nby others engaged in a similar manner of life. In this way he had, from\nnecessity, acquired agility to an exceptional degree, so that he could\nleap far into the air, and while in that position select from a passing\nband of insects any which he might desire. This useful accomplishment\nwas, in a measure, the direct means of bringing together the person in\nquestion and the engaging Lila; for, on a certain occasion, when Lee\nSing was passing through the streets of Fow Hou, he heard a great\noutcry, and beheld persons of all ranks running towards him, pointing\nat the same time in an upward direction. Turning his gaze in the manner\nindicated, Lee beheld, with every variety of astonishment, a powerful\nand unnaturally large bird of prey, carrying in its talons the\nlovely and now insensible Lila, to whom it had been attracted by the\nmagnificence of her raiment. The rapacious and evilly-inspired creature\nwas already above the highest dwelling-houses when Lee first beheld it,\nand was plainly directing its course towards the inaccessible mountain\ncrags beyond the city walls. Nevertheless, Lee resolved upon an\ninspired effort, and without any hesitation bounded towards it with such\nwell-directed proficiency, that if he had not stretched forth his hand\non passing he would inevitably have been carried far above the desired\nobject. In this manner he succeeded in dragging the repulsive and\ncompletely disconcerted monster to the ground, where its graceful and\nunassuming prisoner was released, and the presumptuous bird itself\ntorn to pieces amid continuous shouts of a most respectful and engaging\ndescription in honour of Lee and of his versatile attainment.\n\n\"In consequence of this incident the grateful Lila would often\ndeliberately leave the society of the rich and well-endowed in order\nto accompany Lee on his journeys in pursuit of exceptionally-precious\nwinged insects. Regarding his unusual ability as the undoubted cause of\nher existence at that moment, she took an all-absorbing pride in such\ndisplays, and would utter loud and frequent exclamations of triumph when\nLee leaped out from behind some rock, where he had lain concealed, and\nwith unfailing regularity secured the object of his adroit movement. In\nthis manner a state of feeling which was by no means favourable to\nthe aspiring picture-maker Pe-tsing had long existed between the two\npersons; but when Lee Sing put the matter in the form of an explicit\npetition before Chan Hung (to which adequate reference has already been\nmade), the nature of the decision then arrived at seemed to clothe\nthe realization of their virtuous and estimable desires with an air of\nextreme improbability.\n\n\"'Oh, Lee,' exclaimed the greatly-disappointed maiden when her lover had\nexplained to her the nature of the arrangement--for in her unassuming\nadmiration of the noble qualities of Lee she had anticipated that Chan\nHung would at once have received him with ceremonious embraces and\nassurances of his permanent affection--'how unendurable a state of\nthings is this in which we have become involved! Far removed from this\none's anticipations was the thought of becoming inalienably associated\nwith that outrageous person Pe-tsing, or of entering upon an existence\nwhich will necessitate a feigned admiration of his really unpresentable\nefforts. Yet in such a manner must the entire circumstance complete its\ncourse unless some ingenious method of evading it can be discovered in\nthe meantime. Alas, my beloved one! the occupation of ensnaring winged\ninsects is indeed an alluring one, but as far as this person has\nobserved, it is also exceedingly unproductive of taels. Could not some\nmore expeditious means of enriching yourself be discovered? Frequently\nhas the unnoticed but nevertheless very attentive Lila heard her father\nand the round-bodied ones who visit him speak of exploits which seem\nto consist of assuming the shapes of certain wild animals, and in that\nguise appearing from time to time at the place of exchange within\nthe city walls. As this form of entertainment is undoubtedly very\nremunerative in its results, could not the versatile and ready-witted\nLee conceal himself within the skin of a bear, or some other untamed\nbeast, and in this garb, joining them unperceived, play an appointed\npart and receive a just share of the reward?'\n\n\"'The result of such an enterprise might, if the matter chanced to take\nan unforeseen development, prove of a very doubtful nature,' replied\nLee Sing, to whom, indeed, the proposed venture appeared in a somewhat\nundignified light, although, with refined consideration, he withheld\nsuch a thought from Lila, who had proposed it for him, and also\nconfessed that her usually immaculate father had taken part in such an\nexhibition. 'Nevertheless, do not permit the dark shadow of an inward\ncloud to reflect itself upon your almost invariably amiable countenance,\nfor this person has become possessed of a valuable internal suggestion\nwhich, although he has hitherto neglected, being content with a small\nbut assured competency, would doubtless bring together a serviceable\nnumber of taels if rightly utilized.'\n\n\"'Greatly does this person fear that the valuable internal suggestion\nof Lee Sing will weigh but lightly in the commercial balance against\nthe very rapidly executed pictures of Pe-tsing,' said Lila, who had not\nfully recalled from her mind a disturbing emotion that Lee would\nhave been well advised to have availed himself of her ingenious and\nwell-thought-out suggestion. 'But of what does the matter consist?'\n\n\"'It is the best explained by a recital of the circumstances leading up\nto it,' said Lee. 'Upon an occasion when this person was passing through\nthe streets of Fow Hou, there gathered around him a company of those who\nhad, on previous occasions, beheld his exceptional powers of hurtling\nhimself through the air in an upward direction, praying that he would\nagain delight their senses by a similar spectacle. Not being unwilling\nto afford those estimable persons of the amusement they desired, this\none, without any elaborate show of affected hesitancy, put himself\ninto the necessary position, and would without doubt have risen\nuninterruptedly almost into the Middle Air, had he not, in making the\npreparatory movements, placed his left foot upon an over-ripe wampee\nwhich lay unperceived on the ground. In consequence of this really\nblameworthy want of caution the entire manner and direction of this\nshort-sighted individual's movements underwent a sudden and complete\nchange, so that to those who stood around it appeared as though he were\nmaking a well-directed endeavour to penetrate through the upper surface\nof the earth. This unexpected display had the effect of removing the\ngravity of even the most aged and severe-minded persons present, and for\nthe space of some moments the behaviour and positions of those who stood\naround were such that they were quite unable to render any assistance,\ngreatly as they doubtless wished to do so. Being in this manner allowed\na period for inward reflexion of a very concentrated order, it arose\nwithin this one's mind that at every similar occurrence which he had\nwitnessed, those who observed the event had been seized in a like\nfashion, being very excessively amused. The fact was made even more\nundoubted by the manner of behaving of an exceedingly stout and\nround-faced person, who had not been present from the beginning, but who\nwas affected to a most incredible extent when the details, as they had\noccurred, were made plain to him, he declaring, with many references to\nthe Sacred Dragon and the Seven Walled Temple at Peking, that he would\nwillingly have contributed a specified number of taels rather than\nhave missed the diversion. When at length this person reached his own\nchamber, he diligently applied himself to the task of carrying into\npractical effect the suggestion which had arisen in his mind. By an\narrangement of transparent glasses and reflecting surfaces--which, were\nit not for a well-defined natural modesty, he would certainly be tempted\nto describe as highly ingenious--he ultimately succeeded in bringing\nabout the effect he desired.'\n\n\"With these words Lee put into Lila's hands an object which closely\nresembled the contrivances by which those who are not sufficiently\npowerful to obtain positions near the raised platform, in the Halls of\nCelestial Harmony, are nevertheless enabled to observe the complexions\nand attire of all around them. Regulating it by means of a hidden\nspring, he requested her to follow closely the actions of a\nheavily-burdened passerby who was at that moment some little distance\nbeyond them. Scarcely had Lila raised the glass to her eyes than she\nbecame irresistibly amused to a most infectious degree, greatly to the\nsatisfaction of Lee, who therein beheld the realization of his hopes.\nNot for the briefest space of time would she permit the object to pass\nfrom her, but directed it at every person who came within her sight,\nwith frequent and unfeigned exclamations of wonder and delight.\n\n\"'How pleasant and fascinating a device is this!' exclaimed Lila at\nlength. 'By what means is so diverting and gravity-removing a result\nobtained?'\n\n\"'Further than that it is the concentration of much labour of\ncontinually trying with glasses and reflecting surfaces, this person is\ntotally unable to explain it,' replied Lee. 'The chief thing, however,\nis that at whatever moving object it is directed--no matter whether a\nperson so observed is being carried in a chair, riding upon an animal,\nor merely walking--at a certain point he has every appearance of being\nunexpectedly hurled to the ground in a most violent and mirth-provoking\nmanner. Would not the stout and round-faced one, who would cheerfully\nhave contributed a certain number of taels to see this person manifest a\nsimilar exhibition, unhesitatingly lay out that sum to secure the means\nof so gratifying his emotions whenever he felt the desire, even with\nthe revered persons of the most dignified ones in the Empire? Is there,\nindeed, a single person between the Wall and the Bitter Waters on the\nSouth who is so devoid of ambition that he would miss the opportunity of\nsubjecting, as it were, perhaps even the sacred Emperor himself to the\nexceptional feat?'\n\n\"'The temptation to possess one would inevitably prove overwhelming to\nany person of ordinary intelligence,' admitted Lila. 'Yet, in spite of\nthis one's unassumed admiration for the contrivance, internal doubts\nregarding the ultimate happiness of the two persons who are now\ndiscussing the matter again attack her. She recollects, somewhat dimly,\nan almost forgotten, but nevertheless, very unassailable proverb, which\ndeclares that more contentment of mind can assuredly be obtained from\nthe unexpected discovery of a tael among the folds of a discarded\ngarment than could, in the most favourable circumstances, ensue from\nthe well-thought-out construction of a new and hitherto unknown\ndevice. Furthermore, although the span of a year may seem unaccountably\nprotracted when persons who reciprocate engaging sentiments are\nparted, yet when the acceptance or refusal of Pe-tsing's undesirable\npledging-gifts hangs upon the accomplishment of a remote and not very\nprobable object within that period, it becomes as a breath of wind\npassing through an autumn forest.'\n\n\"Since the day when Lila and Lee had sat together side by side, and\nconversed in this unrestrained and irreproachable manner, the great\nsky-lantern had many times been obscured for a period. Only an\ninsignificant portion of the year remained, yet the affairs of Lee Sing\nwere in no more prosperous a condition than before, nor had he found an\nopportunity to set aside any store of taels. Each day the unsupportable\nPe-tsing became more and more obtrusive and self-conceited, even to\nthe extent of throwing far into the air coins of insignificant value\nwhenever he chanced to pass Lee in the street, at the same time urging\nhim to leap after them and thereby secure at least one or two pieces of\nmoney against the day of calculating. In a similar but entirely opposite\nfashion, Lila and Lee experienced the acutest pangs of an ever-growing\ndespair, until their only form of greeting consisted in gazing into each\nother's eyes with a soul-benumbing expression of self-reproach.\n\n\"Yet at this very time, when even the natural and unalterable powers\nseemed to be conspiring against the success of Lee's modest and\ninoffensive hopes, an event was taking place which was shortly to\nreverse the entire settled arrangement of persons and affairs, and\ninvolved Fow Hou in a very inextricable state of uncertainty. For, not\nto make a pretence of concealing a matter which has been already in part\nrevealed, the Mandarin Chan Hung had by this time determined to act in\nthe manner which Ming-hi had suggested; so that on a certain morning\nLee Sing was visited by two persons, bearing between them a very weighty\nsack of taels, who also conveyed to him the fact that a like amount\nwould be deposited within his door at the end of each succeeding seven\ndays. Although Lee's occupation had in the past been very meagrely\nrewarded, either by taels or by honour, the circumstance which resulted\nin his now receiving so excessively large a sum is not made clear until\nthe detail of Ming-hi's scheme is closely examined. The matter then\nbecomes plain, for it had been suggested by that person that the most\nproficient in any occupation should be rewarded to a certain extent,\nand the least proficient to another stated extent, the original amounts\nbeing reversed. When those engaged by Chang Hung to draw up the various\nrates came to the profession of ensnaring winged insects, however, they\ndiscovered that Lee Sing was the only one of that description in Fow\nHou, so that it became necessary in consequence to allot him a double\nportion, one amount as the most proficient, and a much larger amount as\nthe least proficient.\n\n\"It is unnecessary now to follow the not altogether satisfactory\ncondition of affairs which began to exist in Fow Hou as soon as the\nscheme was put into operation. The full written papers dealing with the\nmatter are in the Hall of Public Reference at Peking, and can be seen by\nany person on the payment of a few taels to everyone connected with\nthe establishment. Those who found their possessions reduced thereby\ncompletely overlooked the obvious justice of the arrangement, and\nimmediately began to take most severe measures to have the order put\naside; while those who suddenly and unexpectedly found themselves\nraised to positions of affluence tended to the same end by conducting\nthemselves in a most incapable and undiscriminating manner. And during\nthe entire period that this state of things existed in Fow Hou the\nreally contemptible Ming-hi continually followed Chan Hung about from\nplace to place, spreading out his feet towards him, and allowing himself\nto become openly amused to a most unseemly extent.\n\n\"Chief among those who sought to have the original manner of rewarding\npersons again established was the picture-maker, Pe-tsing, who now found\nhimself in a condition of most abject poverty, so unbearable, indeed,\nthat he frequently went by night, carrying a lantern, in the hope that\nhe might discover some of the small pieces of money which he had been\naccustomed to throw into the air on meeting Lee Sing. To his pangs of\nhunger was added the fear that he would certainly lose Lila, so that\nfrom day to day he redoubled his efforts, and in the end, by using false\nstatements and other artifices of a questionable nature, the party which\nhe led was successful in obtaining the degradation of Chan Hung and his\ndismissal from office, together with an entire reversal of all his plans\nand enactments.\n\n\"On the last day of the year which Chan Hung had appointed as the period\nof test for his daughter's suitors, the person in question was seated\nin a chamber of his new abode--a residence of unassuming appearance but\nundoubted comfort--surrounded by Lila and Lee, when the hanging curtains\nwere suddenly flung aside, and Pe-tsing, followed by two persons of low\nrank bearing sacks of money, appeared among them.\n\n\"'Chan Hung,' he said at length, 'in the past events arose which\ncompelled this person to place himself against you in your official\nposition. Nevertheless, he has always maintained towards you personally\nan unchanging affection, and understanding full well that you are one of\nthose who maintain their spoken word in spite of all happenings, he has\nnow come to exhibit the taels which he has collected together, and to\nclaim the fulfilment of your deliberate promise.'\n\n\"With these words the commonplace picture-maker poured forth the\ncontents of the sacks, and stood looking at Lila in a most confident and\nunprepossessing manner.\n\n\"'Pe-tsing,' replied Chan Hung, rising from his couch and speaking in so\nsevere and impressive a voice that the two servants of Pe-tsing at once\nfled in great apprehension, 'this person has also found it necessary, in\nhis official position, to oppose you; but here the similarity ends,\nfor, on his part, he has never felt towards you the remotest degree of\naffection. Nevertheless, he is always desirous, as you say, that persons\nshould regard their spoken word, and as you seem to hold a promise\nfrom the Chief Mandarin of Fow Hou regarding marriage-gifts towards\nhis daughter, he would advise you to go at once to that person.\nA misunderstanding has evidently arisen, for the one whom you are\naddressing is merely Chan Hung, and the words spoken by the Mandarin\nhave no sort of interest for him--indeed, he understands that all that\nperson's acts have been reversed, so that he fails to see how anyone\nat all can regard you and your claim in other than a gravity-removing\nlight. Furthermore, the maiden in question is now definitely and\nirretrievably pledged to this faithful and successful one by my side,\nwho, as you will doubtless be gracefully overjoyed to learn, has\nrecently disposed of a most ingenious and diverting contrivance for an\nenormous number of taels, so many, indeed, that both the immediate and\nthe far-distant future of all the persons who are here before you are\nnow in no sort of doubt whatever.'\n\n\"At these words the three persons whom he had interrupted again turned\ntheir attention to the matter before them; but as Pe-tsing walked away,\nhe observed, though he failed to understand the meaning, that they all\nraised certain objects to their eyes, and at once became amused to a\nmost striking and uncontrollable degree.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE CONFESSION OF KAI LUNG\n\n     Related by himself at Wu-whei when other matter failed him.\n\nAs Kai Lung, the story-teller, unrolled his mat and selected, with grave\ndeliberation, the spot under the mulberry-tree which would the longest\nremain sheltered from the sun's rays, his impassive eye wandered round\nthe thin circle of listeners who had been drawn together by his uplifted\nvoice, with a glance which, had it expressed his actual thoughts, would\nhave betrayed a keen desire that the assembly should be composed of\nstrangers rather than of his most consistent patrons, to whom his stock\nof tales was indeed becoming embarrassingly familiar. Nevertheless, when\nhe began there was nothing in his voice but a trace of insufficiently\nrestrained triumph, such as might be fitly assumed by one who has\ndiscovered and makes known for the first time a story by the renowned\nhistorian Lo Cha.\n\n\"The adventures of the enlightened and nobly-born Yuin-Pel--\"\n\n\"Have already thrice been narrated within Wu-whei by the versatile but\nexceedingly uninventive Kai Lung,\" remarked Wang Yu placidly. \"Indeed,\nhas there not come to be a saying by which an exceptionally frugal\nhost's rice, having undoubtedly seen the inside of the pot many times,\nis now known in this town as Kai-Pel?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" exclaimed Kai Lung, \"well was this person warned of Wu-whei\nin the previous village, as a place of desolation and excessively\nbad taste, whose inhabitants, led by an evil-minded maker of very\ncommonplace pipes, named Wang Yu, are unable to discriminate in all\nmatters not connected with the cooking of food and the evasion of just\ndebts. They at Shan Tzu hung on to my cloak as I strove to leave them,\npraying that I would again entrance their ears with what they termed the\nmelodious word-music of this person's inimitable version of the inspired\nstory of Yuin-Pel.\"\n\n\"Truly the story of Yuin-Pel is in itself excellent,\" interposed the\nconciliatory Hi Seng; \"and Kai Lung's accomplishment of having three\ntimes repeated it here without deviating in the particular of a single\nword from the first recital stamps him as a story-teller of no ordinary\ndegree. Yet the saying 'Although it is desirable to lose persistently\nwhen playing at squares and circles with the broad-minded and sagacious\nEmperor, it is none the less a fact that the observance of this\netiquette deprives the intellectual diversion of much of its interest\nfor both players,' is no less true today than when the all knowing H'sou\nuttered it.\"\n\n\"They well said--they of Shan Tzu--that the people of Wu-whei were\nintolerably ignorant and of low descent,\" continued Kai Lung, without\nheeding the interruption; \"that although invariably of a timorous\nnature, even to the extent of retiring to the woods on the approach of\nthose who select bowmen for the Imperial army, all they require in a\nstory is that it shall be garnished with deeds of bloodshed and violence\nto the exclusion of the higher qualities of well-imagined metaphors and\nliterary style which alone constitute true excellence.\"\n\n\"Yet it has been said,\" suggested Hi Seng, \"that the inimitable Kai\nLung can so mould a narrative in the telling that all the emotions\nare conveyed therein without unduly disturbing the intellects of the\nhearers.\"\n\n\"O amiable Hi Seng,\" replied Kai Lung with extreme affability,\n\"doubtless you are the most expert of water-carriers, and on a hot\nand dusty day, when the insatiable desire of all persons is towards a\ndraught of unusual length without much regard to its composition, the\nsight of your goat-skins is indeed a welcome omen; yet when in the\nseason of Cold White Rains you chance to meet the belated chair-carrier\nwho has been reluctantly persuaded into conveying persons beyond the\nlimit of the city, the solitary official watchman who knows that his\nchief is not at hand, or a returning band of those who make a practise\nof remaining in the long narrow rooms until they are driven forth at a\ncertain gong-stroke, can you supply them with the smallest portion of\nthat invigorating rice spirit for which alone they crave? From this\nsimple and homely illustration, specially conceived to meet the\nrequirements of your stunted and meagre understanding, learn not to\nexpect both grace and thorns from the willow-tree. Nevertheless, your\nvery immature remarks on the art of story-telling are in no degree more\nfoolish than those frequently uttered by persons who make a living by\nsuch a practice; in proof of which this person will relate to the select\nand discriminating company now assembled an entirely new and unrecorded\nstory--that, indeed, of the unworthy, but frequently highly-rewarded Kai\nLung himself.\"\n\n\"The story of Kai Lung!\" exclaimed Wang Yu. \"Why not the story of Ting,\nthe sightless beggar, who has sat all his life outside the Temple of\nMiraculous Cures? Who is Kai Lung, that he should have a story? Is he\nnot known to us all here? Is not his speech that of this Province, his\nfood mean, his arms and legs unshaven? Does he carry a sword or wear\nsilk raiment? Frequently have we seen him fatigued with journeying; many\ntimes has he arrived destitute of money; nor, on those occasions when a\nnewly-appointed and unnecessarily officious Mandarin has commanded\nhim to betake himself elsewhere and struck him with a rod has Kai Lung\ncaused the stick to turn into a deadly serpent and destroy its master,\nas did the just and dignified Lu Fei. How, then, can Kai Lung have a\nstory that is not also the story of Wang Yu and Hi Seng, and all others\nhere?\"\n\n\"Indeed, if the refined and enlightened Wang Yu so decides, it must\nassuredly be true,\" said Kai Lung patiently; \"yet (since even trifles\nserve to dispel the darker thoughts of existence) would not the\nhistory of so small a matter as an opium pipe chain his intelligent\nconsideration? such a pipe, for example, as this person beheld only\ntoday exposed for sale, the bowl composed of the finest red clay,\ndelicately baked and fashioned, the long bamboo stem smoother than the\nsacred tooth of the divine Buddha, the spreading support patiently and\ncunningly carved with scenes representing the Seven Joys, and the Tenth\nHell of unbelievers.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Wang Yu eagerly, \"it is indeed as you say, a Mandarin\namong masterpieces. That pipe, O most unobserving Kai Lung, is the work\nof this retiring and superficial person who is now addressing you, and,\nthough the fact evidently escaped your all-seeing glance, the place\nwhere it is exposed is none other than his shop of 'The Fountain of\nBeauty,' which you have on many occasions endowed with your honourable\npresence.\"\n\n\"Doubtless the carving is the work of the accomplished Wang Yu, and the\nfitting together,\" replied Kai Lung; \"but the materials for so refined\nand ornamental a production must of necessity have been brought many\nthousand li; the clay perhaps from the renowned beds of Honan, the wood\nfrom Peking, and the bamboo from one of the great forests of the North.\"\n\n\"For what reason?\" said Wang Yu proudly. \"At this person's very door\nis a pit of red clay, purer and infinitely more regular than any to\nbe found at Honan; the hard wood of Wu-whei is extolled among carvers\nthroughout the Empire, while no bamboo is straighter or more smooth than\nthat which grows in the neighbouring woods.\"\n\n\"O most inconsistent Wang Yu!\" cried the story-teller, \"assuredly a very\ncommendable local pride has dimmed your usually penetrating eyesight.\nIs not the clay pit of which you speak that in which you fashioned\nexceedingly unsymmetrical imitations of rat-pies in your childhood? How,\nthen, can it be equal to those of Honan, which you have never seen?\nIn the dark glades of these woods have you not chased the gorgeous\nbutterfly, and, in later years, the no less gaily attired maidens of\nWu-whei in the entrancing game of Kiss in the Circle? Have not the\nbamboo-trees to which you have referred provided you with the ideal\nmaterial wherewith to roof over those cunningly-constructed pits into\nwhich it has ever been the chief delight of the young and audacious to\nlure dignified and unnaturally stout Mandarins? All these things you\nhave seen and used ever since your mother made a successful offering to\nthe Goddess Kum-Fa. How, then, can they be even equal to the products of\nremote Honan and fabulous Peking? Assuredly the generally veracious Wang\nYu speaks this time with closed eyes and will, upon mature reflexion,\neat his words.\"\n\nThe silence was broken by a very aged man who arose from among the\nbystanders.\n\n\"Behold the length of this person's pigtail,\" he exclaimed, \"the\nwhiteness of his moustaches and the venerable appearance of his beard!\nThere is no more aged person present--if, indeed, there be such a one\nin all the Province. It accordingly devolves upon him to speak in this\nmatter, which shall be as follows: The noble-minded and proficient Kai\nLung shall relate the story as he has proposed, and the garrulous Wang\nYu shall twice contribute to Kai Lung's bowl when it is passed round,\nonce for himself and once for this person, in order that he may learn\neither to be more discreet or more proficient in the art of aptly\nreplying.\"\n\n\"The events which it is this person's presumptuous intention to describe\nto this large-hearted and providentially indulgent gathering,\" began\nKai Lung, when his audience had become settled, and the wooden bowl had\npassed to and fro among them, \"did not occupy many years, although they\nwere of a nature which made them of far more importance than all the\nremainder of his existence, thereby supporting the sage discernment of\nthe philosopher Wen-weng, who first made the observation that man is\ngreatly inferior to the meanest fly, inasmuch as that creature, although\ngranted only a day's span of life, contrives during that period to\nfulfil all the allotted functions of existence.\n\n\"Unutterably to the astonishment and dismay of this person and all those\nconnected with him (for several of the most expensive readers of the\nfuture to be found in the Empire had declared that his life would be\nmarked by great events, his career a source of continual wonder, and his\ndeath a misfortune to those who had dealings with him) his efforts to\ntake a degree at the public literary competitions were not attended with\nany adequate success. In view of the plainly expressed advice of his\nfather it therefore became desirable that this person should turn his\nattention to some other method of regaining the esteem of those upon\nwhom he was dependent for all the necessaries of existence. Not having\nthe means wherewith to engage in any form of commerce, and being\nentirely ignorant of all matters save the now useless details of\nattempting to pass public examinations, he reluctantly decided that he\nwas destined to become one of those who imagine and write out stories\nand similar devices for printed leaves and books.\n\n\"This determination was favourably received, and upon learning it, this\nperson's dignified father took him aside, and with many assurances of\nregard presented to him a written sentence, which, he said, would be of\nincomparable value to one engaged in a literary career, and should\nin fact, without any particular qualifications, insure an honourable\ncompetency. He himself, he added, with what at the time appeared to\nthis one as an unnecessary regard for detail, having taken a very\nhigh degree, and being in consequence appointed to a distinguished and\nremunerative position under the Board of Fines and Tortures, had never\nmade any use of it.\n\n\"The written sentence, indeed, was all that it had been pronounced. It\nhad been composed by a remote ancestor, who had spent his entire life in\ncrystallizing all his knowledge and experience into a few written lines,\nwhich as a result became correspondingly precious. It defined in a very\noriginal and profound manner several undisputable principles, and was so\nengagingly subtle in its manner of expression that the most superficial\nperson was irresistibly thrown into a deep inward contemplation upon\nreading it. When it was complete, the person who had contrived this\ningenious masterpiece, discovering by means of omens that he still had\nten years to live, devoted each remaining year to the task of reducing\nthe sentence by one word without in any way altering its meaning. This\nunapproachable example of conciseness found such favour in the eyes\nof those who issue printed leaves that as fast as this person could\ninscribe stories containing it they were eagerly purchased; and had it\nnot been for a very incapable want of foresight on this narrow-minded\nindividual's part, doubtless it would still be affording him an\nagreeable and permanent means of living.\n\n\"Unquestionably the enlightened Wen-weng was well acquainted with the\nsubject when he exclaimed, 'Better a frugal dish of olives flavoured\nwith honey than the most sumptuously devised puppy-pie of which the\ngreater portion is sent forth in silver-lined boxes and partaken of\nby others.' At that time, however, this versatile saying--which so\ngracefully conveys the truth of the undeniable fact that what a person\npossesses is sufficient if he restrain his mind from desiring\naught else--would have been lightly treated by this self-conceited\nstory-teller even if his immature faculties had enabled him fully to\nunderstand the import of so profound and well-digested a remark.\n\n\"At that time Tiao Ts'un was undoubtedly the most beautiful maiden in\nall Peking. So frequently were the verses describing her habits and\nappearances affixed in the most prominent places of the city, that many\npersons obtained an honourable livelihood by frequenting those spots\nand disposing of the sacks of written papers which they collected to\nmerchants who engaged in that commerce. Owing to the fame attained by\nhis written sentence, this really very much inferior being had many\nopportunities of meeting the incomparable maiden Tiao at flower-feasts,\nmelon-seed assemblies, and those gatherings where persons of both sexes\nexhibit themselves in revolving attitudes, and are permitted to embrace\nopenly without reproach; whereupon he became so subservient to her\ncharms and virtues that he lost no opportunity of making himself utterly\nunendurable to any who might chance to speak to, or even gaze upon, this\nHeaven-sent creature.\n\n\"So successful was this person in his endeavour to meet the sublime\nTiao and to gain her conscientious esteem that all emotions of prudence\nforsook him, or it would soon have become apparent even to his enfeebled\nunderstanding that such consistent good fortune could only be the work\nof unforgiving and malignant spirits whose ill-will he had in some way\nearned, and who were luring him on in order that they might accomplish\nhis destruction. That object was achieved on a certain evening when this\nperson stood alone with Tiao upon an eminence overlooking the city and\nwatched the great sky-lantern rise from behind the hills. Under these\ndelicate and ennobling influences he gave speech to many very ornamental\nand refined thoughts which arose within his mind concerning the graceful\nbrilliance of the light which was cast all around, yet notwithstanding\nwhich a still more exceptional and brilliant light was shining in his\nown internal organs by reason of the nearness of an even purer and more\nengaging orb. There was no need, this person felt, to hide even his most\ninside thoughts from the dignified and sympathetic being at his side, so\nwithout hesitation he spoke--in what he believes even now must have been\na very decorative manner--of the many thousand persons who were then\nwrapped in sleep, of the constantly changing lights which appeared in\nthe city beneath, and of the vastness which everywhere lay around.\n\n\"'O Kai Lung,' exclaimed the lovely Tiao, when this person had made an\nend of speaking, 'how expertly and in what a proficient manner do you\nexpress yourself, uttering even the sentiments which this person has\nfelt inwardly, but for which she has no words. Why, indeed, do you not\ninscribe them in a book?'\n\n\"Under her elevating influence it had already occurred to this\nilliterate individual that it would be a more dignified and, perhaps,\neven a more profitable course for him to write out and dispose of, to\nthose who print such matters, the versatile and high-minded expressions\nwhich now continually formed his thoughts, rather than be dependent upon\nthe concise sentence for which, indeed, he was indebted to the wisdom of\na remote ancestor. Tiao's spoken word fully settled his determination,\nso that without delay he set himself to the task of composing a story\nwhich should omit the usual sentence, but should contain instead a large\nnumber of his most graceful and diamond-like thoughts. So engrossed did\nthis near-sighted and superficial person become in the task (which daily\nseemed to increase rather than lessen as new and still more sublime\nimages arose within his mind) that many months passed before the\nmatter was complete. In the end, instead of a story, it had assumed the\nproportions of an important and many-volumed book; while Tiao had in the\nmeantime accepted the wedding gifts of an objectionable and excessively\nround-bodied individual, who had amassed an inconceivable number of\ntaels by inducing persons to take part in what at first sight appeared\nto be an ingenious but very easy competition connected with the order in\nwhich certain horses should arrive at a given and clearly defined spot.\nBy that time, however, this unduly sanguine story-teller had become\ncompletely entranced in his work, and merely regarded Tiao-Ts'un as a\nHeaven-sent but no longer necessary incentive to his success. With\nevery hope, therefore, he went forth to dispose of his written leaves,\nconfident of finding some very wealthy person who would be in a\ncondition to pay him the correct value of the work.\n\n\"At the end of two years this somewhat disillusionized but still\nundaunted person chanced to hear of a benevolent and unassuming body of\nmen who made a habit of issuing works in which they discerned merit,\nbut which, nevertheless, others were unanimous in describing as 'of no\ngood.' Here this person was received with gracious effusion, and\nbeing in a position to impress those with whom he was dealing with his\nundoubted knowledge of the subject, he finally succeeded in making a\nvery advantageous arrangement by which he was to pay one-half of the\nnumber of taels expended in producing the work, and to receive in return\nall the profits which should result from the undertaking. Those who\nwere concerned in the matter were so engagingly impressed with the\nincomparable literary merit displayed in the production that they\ncounselled a great number of copies being made ready in order, as they\nsaid, that this person should not lose by there being any delay\nwhen once the accomplishment became the one topic of conversation in\ntea-houses and yamens. From this cause it came about that the matter of\ntaels to be expended was much greater than had been anticipated at the\nbeginning, so that when the day arrived on which the volumes were to\nbe sent forth this person found that almost his last piece of money had\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Alas! how small a share has a person in the work of controlling his own\ndestiny. Had only the necessarily penurious and now almost degraded Kai\nLung been born a brief span before the great writer Lo Kuan Chang, his\nname would have been received with every mark of esteem from one end of\nthe Empire to the other, while taels and honourable decorations would\nhave been showered upon him. For the truth, which could no longer be\nconcealed, revealed the fact that this inopportune individual possessed\na mind framed in such a manner that his thoughts had already been the\nthoughts of the inspired Lo Kuan, who, as this person would not be so\npresumptuous as to inform this ornamental and well-informed gathering,\nwas the most ingenious and versatile-minded composer of written words\nthat this Empire--and therefore the entire world--has seen, as, indeed,\nhis honourable title of 'The Many-hued Mandarin Duck of the Yang-tse'\nplainly indicates.\n\n\"Although this self-opinionated person had frequently been greatly\nsurprised himself during the writing of his long work by the brilliance\nand manysidedness of the thoughts and metaphors which arose in his mind\nwithout conscious effort, it was not until the appearance of the printed\nleaves which make a custom of warning persons against being persuaded\ninto buying certain books that he definitely understood how all these\nthings had been fully expressed many dynasties ago by the all-knowing\nLo Kuan Chang, and formed, indeed, the great national standard of\nunapproachable excellence. Unfortunately, this person had been so deeply\nengrossed all his life in literary pursuits that he had never found an\nopportunity to glance at the works in question, or he would have escaped\nthe embarrassing position in which he now found himself.\n\n\"It was with a hopeless sense of illness of ease that this unhappy one\nreached the day on which the printed leaves already alluded to would\nmake known their deliberate opinion of his writing, the extremity of his\nhope being that some would at least credit him with honourable motives,\nand perhaps a knowledge that if the inspired Lo Kuan Chan had never\nbeen born the entire matter might have been brought to a very different\nconclusion. Alas! only one among the many printed leaves which\nmade reference to the venture contained any words of friendship or\nencouragement. This benevolent exception was sent forth from a city\nin the extreme Northern Province of the Empire, and contained many\ninspiring though delicately guarded messages of hope for the one to whom\nthey gracefully alluded as 'this undoubtedly youthful, but nevertheless,\ndistinctly promising writer of books.' While admitting that altogether\nthey found the production undeniably tedious, they claimed to have\ndiscovered indications of an obvious talent, and therefore they\nunhesitatingly counselled the person in question to take courage at the\nprospect of a moderate competency which was certainly within his grasp\nif he restrained his somewhat over-ambitious impulses and closely\nobserved the simple subjects and manner of expression of their own Chang\nChow, whose 'Lines to a Wayside Chrysanthemum,' 'Mongolians who Have,'\nand several other composed pieces, they then set forth. Although it\nbecame plain that the writer of this amiably devised notice was, like\nthis incapable person, entirely unacquainted with the masterpieces of\nLo Kuan Chang, yet the indisputable fact remained that, entirely on\nits merit, the work had been greeted with undoubted enthusiasm, so that\nafter purchasing many examples of the refined printed leaf containing\nit, this person sat far into the night continually reading over the one\nunprejudiced and discriminating expression.\n\n\"All the other printed leaves displayed a complete absence of good\ntaste in dealing with the matter. One boldly asserted that the entire\ncircumstance was the outcome of a foolish jest or wager on the part of\na person who possessed a million taels; another predicted that it was a\ncunning and elaborately thought-out method of obtaining the attention of\nthe people on the part of certain persons who claimed to vend a reliable\nand fragrantly-scented cleansing substance. The _Valley of Hoang Rose\nLeaves and Sweetness_ hoped, in a spirit of no sincerity, that the\ningenious Kai Lung would not rest on his tea-leaves, but would soon\nsend forth an equally entertaining amended example of the _Sayings of\nConfucious_ and other sacred works, while the _Pure Essence of the Seven\nDays' Happenings_ merely printed side by side portions from the two\nbooks under the large inscription, 'IS THERE REALLY ANY NEED FOR US TO\nEXPRESS OURSELVES MORE CLEARLY?'\n\n\"The disappointment both as regards public esteem and taels--for, after\nthe manner in which the work had been received by those who advise\non such productions, not a single example was purchased--threw this\nill-destined individual into a condition of most unendurable depression,\nfrom which he was only aroused by a remarkable example of the unfailing\nwisdom of the proverb which says 'Before hastening to secure a possible\nreward of five taels by dragging an unobservant person away from a\nfalling building, examine well his features lest you find, when too\nlate, that it is one to whom you are indebted for double that amount.'\nDisappointed in the hope of securing large gains from the sale of his\ngreat work, this person now turned his attention again to his former\nmeans of living, only to find, however, that the discredit in which he\nhad become involved even attached itself to his concise sentence; for in\nplace of the remunerative and honourable manner in which it was formerly\nreceived, it was now regarded on all hands with open suspicion. Instead\nof meekly kow-towing to an evidently pre-arranged doom, the last\nmisfortune aroused this usually resigned story-teller to an ungovernable\nfrenzy. Regarding the accomplished but at the same time exceedingly\nover-productive Lo Kuan Chang as the beginning of all his evils, he took\na solemn oath as a mark of disapproval that he had not been content to\ninscribe on paper only half of his brilliant thoughts, leaving the other\nhalf for the benefit of this hard-striving and equally well-endowed\nindividual, in which case there would have been a sufficiency of taels\nand of fame for both.\n\n\"For a very considerable space of time this person could conceive no\nmethod by which he might attain his object. At length, however, as\na result of very keen and subtle intellectual searching, and many\nwell-selected sacrifices, it was conveyed by means of a dream that\none very ingenious yet simple way was possible. The renowned and\nuniversally-admired writings of the distinguished Lo Kuan for the most\npart take their action within a few dynasties of their creator's\nown time: all that remained for this inventive person to accomplish,\ntherefore, was to trace out the entire matter, making the words and\nspeeches to proceed from the mouths of those who existed in still\nearlier periods. By this crafty method it would at once appear as though\nthe not-too-original Lo Kuan had been indebted to one who came before\nhim for all his most subtle thoughts, and, in consequence, his tomb\nwould become dishonoured and his memory execrated. Without any delay\nthis person cheerfully set himself to the somewhat laborious task\nbefore him. Lo Kuan's well-known exclamation of the Emperor Tsing on the\nbattlefield of Shih-ho, 'A sedan-chair! a sedan-chair! This person will\nunhesitatingly exchange his entire and well-regulated Empire for such an\narticle,' was attributed to an Emperor who lived several thousand years\nbefore the treacherous and unpopular Tsing. The new matter of a no less\nfrequently quoted portion ran: 'O nobly intentioned but nevertheless\nexceedingly morose Tung-shin, the object before you is your\ndistinguished and evilly-disposed-of father's honourably-inspired\ndemon,' the change of a name effecting whatever alteration was\nnecessary; while the delicately-imagined speech beginning 'The person\nwho becomes amused at matters resulting from double-edged knives has\nassuredly never felt the effect of a well-directed blow himself' was\ntaken from the mouth of one person and placed in that of one of his\nremote ancestors. In such a manner, without in any great degree altering\nthe matter of Lo Kuan's works, all the scenes and persons introduced\nwere transferred to much earlier dynasties than those affected by the\nincomparable writer himself, the final effect being to give an air of\nextreme unoriginality to his really undoubtedly genuine conceptions.\n\n\"Satisfied with his accomplishment, and followed by a hired person\nof low class bearing the writings, which, by nature of the research\nnecessary in fixing the various dates and places so that even the wary\nshould be deceived, had occupied the greater part of a year, this now\nfully confident story-teller--unmindful of the well-tried excellence of\nthe inspired saying, 'Money is hundred-footed; upon perceiving a\ntael lying apparently unobserved upon the floor, do not lose the time\nnecessary in stooping, but quickly place your foot upon it, for one\nfails nothing in dignity thereby; but should it be a gold piece,\ndistrust all things, and valuing dignity but as an empty name, cast your\nentire body upon it'--went forth to complete his great task of finally\nerasing from the mind and records of the Empire the hitherto venerated\nname of Lo Kuan Chang. Entering the place of commerce of the one who\nseemed the most favourable for the purpose, he placed the facts as they\nwould in future be represented before him, explained the undoubtedly\nremunerative fame that would ensue to all concerned in the enterprise\nof sending forth the printed books in their new form, and, opening at a\nventure the written leaves which he had brought with him, read out the\nfollowing words as an indication of the similarity of the entire work:\n\n  \"'_Whai-Keng_. Friends, Chinamen, labourers who are engaged in\n  agricultural pursuits, entrust to this person your acute and\n  well-educated ears;\n\n  \"'He has merely come to assist in depositing the body of Ko'ung in\n  the Family Temple, not for the purpose of making remarks about him\n  of a graceful and highly complimentary nature;\n\n  \"'The unremunerative actions of which persons may have been guilty\n  possess an exceedingly undesirable amount of endurance;\n\n  \"'The successful and well-considered almost invariably are\n  involved in a directly contrary course;\n\n  \"'This person desires nothing more than a like fate to await\n  Ko'ung.'\n\n\"When this one had read so far, he paused in order to give the other\nan opportunity of breaking in and offering half his possessions to\nbe allowed to share in the undertaking. As he remained unaccountably\nsilent, however, an inelegant pause occurred which this person at length\nbroke by desiring an expressed opinion on the matter.\n\n\"'O exceedingly painstaking, but nevertheless highly inopportune Kai\nLung,' he replied at length, while in his countenance this person\nread an expression of no-encouragement towards his venture, 'all your\nentrancing efforts do undoubtedly appear to attract the undesirable\nattention of some spiteful and tyrannical demon. This closely-written\nand elaborately devised work is in reality not worth the labour of a\nsingle stroke, nor is there in all Peking a sender forth of printed\nleaves who would encourage any project connected with its issue.'\n\n\"'But the importance of such a fact as that which would clearly show the\nhitherto venerated Lo Kuan Chang to be a person who passed off as his\nown the work of an earlier one!' cried this person in despair, well\nknowing that the deliberately expressed opinion of the one before him\nwas a matter that would rule all others. 'Consider the interest of the\ndiscovery.'\n\n\"'The interest would not demand more than a few lines in the ordinary\nprinted leaves,' replied the other calmly. 'Indeed, in a manner of\nspeaking, it is entirely a detail of no consequence whether or not the\nsublime Lo Kuan ever existed. In reality his very commonplace name may\nhave been simply Lung; his inspired work may have been written a score\nof dynasties before him by some other person, or they may have been\ncomposed by the enlightened Emperor of the period, who desired to\nconceal the fact, yet these matters would not for a moment engage the\ninterest of any ordinary passer-by. Lo Kuan Chang is not a person in the\nordinary expression; he is an embodiment of a distinguished and utterly\nunassailable national institution. The Heaven-sent works with which\nhe is, by general consent, connected form the necessary unchangeable\nstandard of literary excellence, and remain for ever above rivalry and\nabove mistrust. For this reason the matter is plainly one which does not\ninterest this person.'\n\n\"In the course of a not uneventful existence this self-deprecatory\nperson has suffered many reverses and disappointments. During his youth\nthe high-minded Empress on one occasion stopped and openly complimented\nhim on the dignified outline presented by his body in profile, and when\nhe was relying upon this incident to secure him a very remunerative\npublic office, a jealous and powerful Mandarin substituted a somewhat\nsimilar, though really very much inferior, person for him at the\ninterview which the Empress had commanded. Frequently in matters of\ncommerce which have appeared to promise very satisfactorily at the\nbeginning this person has been induced to entrust sums of money to\nothers, when he had hoped from the indications and the manner of\nspeaking that the exact contrary would be the case; and in one\ninstance he was released at a vast price from the torture dungeon in\nCanton--where he had been thrown by the subtle and unconscientious\nplots of one who could not relate stories in so accurate and unvarying\na manner as himself--on the day before that on which all persons were\nfreely set at liberty on account of exceptional public rejoicing. Yet in\nspite of these and many other very unendurable incidents, this impetuous\nand ill-starred being never felt so great a desire to retire to a\nsolitary place and there disfigure himself permanently as a mark of\nhis unfeigned internal displeasure, as on the occasion when he endured\nextreme poverty and great personal inconvenience for an entire year in\norder that he might take away face from the memory of a person who was\nso placed that no one expressed any interest in the matter.\n\n\"Since then this very ill-clad and really necessitous person has\ndevoted himself to the honourable but exceedingly arduous and in general\nunremunerative occupation of story-telling. To this he would add nothing\nsave that not infrequently a nobly-born and highly-cultured audience\nis so entranced with his commonplace efforts to hold the attention,\nespecially when a story not hitherto known has been related, that in\norder to afford it an opportunity of expressing its gratification, he\nhas been requested to allow another offering to be made by all persons\npresent at the conclusion of the entertainment.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE VENGEANCE OF TUNG FEL\n\nFor a period not to be measured by days or weeks the air of Ching-fow\nhad been as unrestful as that of the locust plains beyond the Great\nWall, for every speech which passed bore two faces, one fair to hear,\nas a greeting, but the other insidiously speaking behind a screen, of\nrebellion, violence, and the hope of overturning the fixed order of\nevents. With those whom they did not mistrust of treachery persons spoke\nin low voices of definite plans, while at all times there might appear\nin prominent places of the city skilfully composed notices setting\nforth great wrongs and injustices towards which resignation and a lowly\nbearing were outwardly counselled, yet with the same words cunningly\ninflaming the minds, even of the patient, as no pouring out of\npassionate thoughts and undignified threatenings could have done. Among\nthe people, unknown, unseen, and unsuspected, except to the proved ones\nto whom they desired to reveal themselves, moved the agents of the Three\nSocieties. While to the many of Ching-fow nothing was desired or even\nthought of behind the downfall of their own officials, and, chief of\nall, the execution of the evil-minded and depraved Mandarin Ping Siang,\nwhose cruelties and extortions had made his name an object of wide and\ndeserved loathing, the agents only regarded the city as a bright spot in\nthe line of blood and fire which they were fanning into life from Peking\nto Canton, and which would presumably burst forth and involve the entire\nEmpire.\n\nAlthough it had of late become a plain fact, by reason of the manner\nof behaving of the people, that events of a sudden and turbulent nature\ncould not long be restrained, yet outwardly there was no exhibition of\nviolence, not even to the length of resisting those whom Ping Siang sent\nto enforce his unjust demands, chiefly because a well-founded whisper\nhad been sent round that nothing was to be done until Tung Fel should\narrive, which would not be until the seventh day in the month of Winged\nDragons. To this all persons agreed, for the more aged among them,\nwho, by virtue of their years, were also the formers of opinion in all\nmatters, called up within their memories certain events connected with\nthe two persons in question which appeared to give to Tung Fel the\nprivilege of expressing himself clearly when the matter of finally\ndealing with the malicious and self-willed Mandarin should be engaged\nupon.\n\nAmong the mountains which enclose Ching-fow on the southern side dwelt\na jade-seeker, who also kept goats. Although a young man and entirely\nwithout relations, he had, by patient industry, contrived to collect\ntogether a large flock of the best-formed and most prolific goats to be\nfound in the neighbourhood, all the money which he received in exchange\nfor jade being quickly bartered again for the finest animals which he\ncould obtain. He was dauntless in penetrating to the most inaccessible\nparts of the mountains in search of the stone, unfailing in his skilful\ncare of the flock, in which he took much honourable pride, and on all\noccasions discreet and unassumingly restrained in his discourse and\nmanner of life. Knowing this to be his invariable practice, it was with\nemotions of an agreeable curiosity that on the seventh day of the month\nof Winged Dragons those persons who were passing from place to place in\nthe city beheld this young man, Yang Hu, descending the mountain path\nwith unmistakable signs of profound agitation, and an entire absence of\nprudent care. Following him closely to the inner square of the city, on\nthe continually expressed plea that they themselves had business in\nthat quarter, these persons observed Yang Hu take up a position of\nunendurable dejection as he gazed reproachfully at the figure of the\nall-knowing Buddha which surmounted the Temple where it was his custom\nto sacrifice.\n\n\"Alas!\" he exclaimed, lifting up his voice, when it became plain that\na large number of people was assembled awaiting his words, \"to what end\ndoes a person strive in this excessively evilly-regulated district? Or\nis it that this obscure and ill-destined one alone is marked out as with\na deep white cross for humiliation and ruin? Father, and Sacred Temple\nof Ancestral Virtues, wherein the meanest can repose their trust, he has\nnone; while now, being more destitute than the beggar at the gate, the\nhope of honourable marriage and a robust family of sons is more remote\nthan the chance of finding the miracle-working Crystal Image which marks\nthe last footstep of the Pure One. Yesterday this person possessed no\nsecret store of silver or gold, nor had he knowledge of any special\namount of jade hidden among the mountains, but to his call there\nresponded four score goats, the most select and majestic to be found in\nall the Province, of which, nevertheless, it was his yearly custom to\nsacrifice one, as those here can testify, and to offer another as a duty\nto the Yamen of Ping Siang, in neither case opening his eyes widely when\nthe hour for selecting arrived. Yet in what an unseemly manner is his\nrespectful piety and courteous loyalty rewarded! To-day, before this\nperson went forth on his usual quest, there came those bearing written\npapers by which they claimed, on the authority of Ping Siang, the\nwhole of this person's flock, as a punishment and fine for his not\ncontributing without warning to the Celebration of Kissing the Emperor's\nFace--the very obligation of such a matter being entirely unknown to\nhim. Nevertheless, those who came drove off this person's entire\nwealth, the desperately won increase of a life full of great toil and\nuncomplainingly endured hardship, leaving him only his cave in the\nrocks, which even the most grasping of many-handed Mandarins cannot\nremove, his cloak of skins, which no beggar would gratefully receive,\nand a bright and increasing light of deep hate scorching within his mind\nwhich nothing but the blood of the obdurate extortioner can efficiently\nquench. No protection of charms or heavily-mailed bowmen shall\navail him, for in his craving for just revenge this person will meet\nwitchcraft with a Heaven-sent cause and oppose an unsleeping subtlety\nagainst strength. Therefore let not the innocent suffer through an\ninsufficient understanding, O Divine One, but direct the hand of your\nfaithful worshipper towards the heart that is proud in tyranny, and\nholds as empty words the clearly defined promise of an all-seeing\njustice.\"\n\nScarcely had Yang Hu made an end of speaking before there happened an\nevent which could be regarded in no other light than as a direct answer\nto his plainly expressed request for a definite sign. Upon the clear\nair, which had become unnaturally still at Yang Hu's words, as though\nto remove any chance of doubt that this indeed was the requested answer,\ncame the loud beating of many very powerful brass gongs, indicating the\napproach of some person of undoubted importance. In a very brief period\nthe procession reached the square, the gong-beaters being followed\nby persons carrying banners, bowmen in armour, others bearing various\nweapons and instruments of torture, slaves displaying innumerable\nchanges of raiment to prove the rank and consequence of their master,\numbrella carriers and fan wavers, and finally, preceded by incense\nburners and surrounded by servants who cleared away all obstructions by\nmeans of their formidable and heavily knotted lashes, the unworthy and\ndeceitful Mandarin Ping Siang, who sat in a silk-hung and elaborately\nwrought chair, looking from side to side with gestures and expressions\nof contempt and ill-restrained cupidity.\n\nAt the sign of this powerful but unscrupulous person all those who were\npresent fell upon their faces, leaving a broad space in their midst,\nexcept Yang Hu, who stepped back into the shadow of a doorway, being\nresolved that he would not prostrate himself before one whom Heaven had\npointed out as the proper object of his just vengeance.\n\nWhen the chair of Ping Siang could no longer be observed in the\ndistance, and the sound of his many gongs had died away, all the persons\nwho had knelt at his approach rose to their feet, meeting each other's\neyes with glances of assured and profound significance. At length there\nstepped forth an exceedingly aged man, who was generally believed to\nhave the power of reading omens and forecasting futures, so that at his\nupraised hand all persons became silent.\n\n\"Behold!\" he exclaimed, \"none can turn aside in doubt from the\ndeliberately pointed finger of Buddha. Henceforth, in spite of the\nwell-intentioned suggestions of those who would shield him under the\nplea of exacting orders from high ones at Peking or extortions practised\nby slaves under him of which he is ignorant, there can no longer be any\ntwo voices concerning the guilty one. Yet what does the knowledge of\nthe cormorant's cry avail the golden carp in the shallow waters of the\nYuen-Kiang? A prickly mormosa is an adequate protection against a naked\nman armed only with a just cause, and a company of bowmen has been known\nto quench an entire city's Heaven-felt desire for retribution. This\nperson, and doubtless others also, would have experienced a more\nheartfelt enthusiasm in the matter if the sublime and omnipotent\nBuddha had gone a step further, and pointed out not only the one to\nbe punished, but also the instrument by which the destiny could be\nprudently and effectively accomplished.\"\n\nFrom the mountain path which led to Yang Hu's cave came a voice, like\nan expressly devised reply to this speech. It was that of some person\nuttering the \"Chant of Rewards and Penalties\":\n\n  \"How strong is the mountain sycamore!\n  \"Its branches reach the Middle Air, and the eye of none can pierce\n      its foliage;\n  \"It draws power and nourishment from all around, so that weeds\n      alone may flourish under its shadow.\n  \"Robbers find safety within the hollow of its trunk; its branches\n      hide vampires and all manner of evil things which prey upon\n      the innocent;\n  \"The wild boar of the forest sharpen their tusks against the bark,\n      for it is harder than flint, and the axe of the woodsman turns\n      back upon the striker.\n  \"Then cries the sycamore, 'Hail and rain have no power against me,\n      nor can the fiercest sun penetrate beyond my outside fringe;\n  \"'The man who impiously raises his hand against me falls by his\n      own stroke and weapon.\n  \"'Can there be a greater or a more powerful than this one?\n      Assuredly, I am Buddha; let all things obey me.'\n  \"Whereupon the weeds bow their heads, whispering among themselves,\n      'The voice of the Tall One we hear, but not that of Buddha.\n      Indeed, it is doubtless as he says.'\n  \"In his musk-scented Heaven Buddha laughs, and not deigning to\n      raise his head from the lap of the Phoenix Goddess, he thrusts\n      forth a stone which lies by his foot.\n  \"Saying, 'A god's present for a god. Take it carefully, O\n      presumptuous Little One, for it is hot to the touch.'\n  \"The thunderbolt falls and the mighty tree is rent in twain. 'They\n      asked for my messenger,' said the Pure One, turning again to\n      repose.\n  \"Lo, _he comes_!\"\n\nWith the last spoken word there came into the sight of those who were\ncollected together a person of stern yet engaging appearance. His hands\nand face were the colour of mulberry stain by long exposure to the sun,\nwhile his eyes looked forth like two watch-fires outside a wolf-haunted\ncamp. His long pigtail was tangled with the binding tendrils of the\nforest, and damp with the dew of an open couch. His apparel was in no\nway striking or brilliant, yet he strode with the dignity and air of a\nhigh official, pushing before him a covered box upon wheels.\n\n\"It is Tung Fel!\" cried many who stood there watching his approach,\nin tones which showed those who spoke to be inspired by a variety of\nimpressive emotions. \"Undoubtedly this is the seventh day of the month\nof Winged Dragons, and, as he specifically stated would be the case, lo!\nhe has come.\"\n\nFew were the words of greeting which Tung Fel accorded even to the most\nvenerable of those who awaited him.\n\n\"This person has slept, partaken of fruit and herbs, and devoted an\nallotted time to inward contemplation,\" he said briefly. \"Other and\nmore weighty matters than the exchange of dignified compliments and the\nadmiration of each other's profiles remain to be accomplished. What, for\nexample, is the significance of the written parchment which is displayed\nin so obtrusive a manner before our eyes? Bring it to this person\nwithout delay.\"\n\nAt these words all those present followed Tung Fel's gaze with\nastonishment, for conspicuously displayed upon the wall of the Temple\nwas a written notice which all joined in asserting had not been there\nthe moment before, though no man had approached the spot. Nevertheless\nit was quickly brought to Tung Fel, who took it without any fear or\nhesitation and read aloud the words which it contained.\n\n           \"TO THE CUSTOM-RESPECTING PERSONS OF CHING-FOW.\n\n  \"Truly the span of existence of any upon this earth is brief and\n  not to be considered; therefore, O unfortunate dwellers of\n  Ching-fow, let it not affect your digestion that your bodies are\n  in peril of sudden and most excruciating tortures and your Family\n  Temples in danger of humiliating disregard.\n\n  \"Why do your thoughts follow the actions of the noble Mandarin\n  Ping Siang so insidiously, and why after each unjust exaction do\n  your eyes look redly towards the Yamen?\n\n  \"Is he not the little finger of those at Peking, obeying their\n  commands and only carrying out the taxation which others have\n  devised? Indeed, he himself has stated such to be the fact. If,\n  therefore, a terrible and unforeseen fate overtook the usually\n  cautious and well-armed Ping Siang, doubtless--perhaps after the\n  lapse of some considerable time--another would be sent from Peking\n  for a like purpose, and in this way, after a too-brief period of\n  heaven-sent rest and prosperity, affairs would regulate themselves\n  into almost as unendurable a condition as before.\n\n  \"Therefore ponder these things well, O passer-by. Yesterday the\n  only man-child of Huang the wood-carver was taken away to be sold\n  into slavery by the emissaries of the most just Ping Siang (who\n  would not have acted thus, we are assured, were it not for the\n  insatiable ones at Peking), as it had become plain that the very\n  necessitous Huang had no other possession to contribute to the\n  amount to be expended in coloured lights as a mark of public\n  rejoicing on the occasion of the moonday of the sublime Emperor.\n  The illiterate and prosaic-minded Huang, having in a most unseemly\n  manner reviled and even assailed those who acted in the matter,\n  has been effectively disposed of, and his wife now alternately\n  laughs and shrieks in the Establishment of Irregular Intellects.\n\n  \"For this reason, gazer, and because the matter touches you more\n  closely than, in your self-imagined security, you are prone to\n  think, deal expediently with the time at your disposal. Look twice\n  and lingeringly to-night upon the face of your first-born, and\n  clasp the form of your favourite one in a closer embrace, for he\n  by whose hand the blow is directed may already have cast devouring\n  eyes upon their fairness, and to-morrow he may say to his armed\n  men: 'The time is come; bring her to me.'\"\n\n\"From the last sentence of the well-intentioned and undoubtedly\nmoderately-framed notice this person will take two phrases,\" remarked\nTung Fel, folding the written paper and placing it among his\ngarments, \"which shall serve him as the title of the lifelike and\naccurately-represented play which it is his self-conceited intention\nnow to disclose to this select and unprejudiced gathering. The scene\nrepresents an enlightened and well-merited justice overtaking an\narrogant and intolerable being who--need this person add?--existed many\ndynasties ago, and the title is:\n\n                         \"THE TIME IS COME!\n                           BY WHOSE HAND?\"\n\nDelivering himself in this manner, Tung Fel drew back the hanging\ndrapery which concealed the front of his large box, and disclosed to\nthose who were gathered round, not, as they had expected, a passage\nfrom the Record of the Three Kingdoms, or some other dramatic work of\nundoubted merit, but an ingeniously constructed representation of a\nscene outside the walls of their own Ching-fow. On one side was a small\nbut minutely accurate copy of a wood-burner's hut, which was known\nto all present, while behind stood out the distant but nevertheless\nunmistakable walls of the city. But it was nearest part of the spectacle\nthat first held the attention of the entranced beholders, for there\ndisported themselves, in every variety of guileless and attractive\nattitude, a number of young and entirely unconcerned doves. Scarcely had\nthe delighted onlookers fully observed the pleasing and effective scene,\nor uttered their expressions of polished satisfaction at the graceful\nand unassuming behaviour of the pretty creatures before them, than the\nview entirely changed, and, as if by magic, the massive and inelegant\nbuilding of Ping Siang's Yamen was presented before them. As all gazed,\nastonished, the great door of the Yamen opened stealthily, and without\na moment's pause a lean and ill-conditioned rat, of unnatural size and\nrapacity, dashed out and seized the most select and engaging of the\nunsuspecting prey in its hungry jaws. With the expiring cry of the\ninnocent victim the entire box was immediately, and in the most\nunexpected manner, involved in a profound darkness, which cleared away\nas suddenly and revealed the forms of the despoiler and the victim lying\ndead by each other's side.\n\nTung Fel came forward to receive the well-selected compliments of all\nwho had witnessed the entertainment.\n\n\"It may be objected,\" he remarked, \"that the play is, in a manner of\nexpressing one's self, incomplete; for it is unrevealed by whose hand\nthe act of justice was accomplished. Yet in this detail is the accuracy\nof the representation justified, for though the time has come, the hand\nby which retribution is accorded shall never be observed.\"\n\nIn such a manner did Tung Fel come to Ching-fow on the seventh day of\nthe month of Winged Dragons, throwing aside all restraint, and no longer\nurging prudence or delay. Of all the throng which stood before him\nscarcely one was without a deep offence against Ping Siang, while those\nwho had not as yet suffered feared what the morrow might display.\n\nA wandering monk from the Island of Irredeemable Plagues was the first\nto step forth in response to Tung Fel's plainly understood suggestion.\n\n\"There is no necessity for this person to undertake further acts of\nbenevolence,\" he remarked, dropping the cloak from his shoulder and\ndisplaying the hundred and eight scars of extreme virtue; \"nor,\" he\ncontinued, holding up his left hand, from which three fingers were burnt\naway, \"have greater endurances been neglected. Yet the matter before\nthis distinguished gathering is one which merits the favourable\nconsideration of all persons, and this one will in no manner turn away,\nrecounting former actions, while he allows others to press forward\ntowards the accomplishment of the just and divinely-inspired act.\"\n\nWith these words the devout and unassuming person in question inscribed\nhis name upon a square piece of rice-paper, attesting his sincerity to\nthe fixed purpose for which it was designed by dipping his thumb into\nthe mixed blood of the slain animals and impressing this unalterable\nseal upon the paper also. He was followed by a seller of drugs and\nsubtle medicines, whose entire stock had been seized and destroyed by\norder of Ping Siang, so that no one in Ching-fow might obtain poison\nfor his destruction. Then came an overwhelming stream of persons, all of\nwhom had received some severe and well-remembered injury at the hands\nof the malicious and vindictive Mandarin. All these followed a similar\nobservance, inscribing their names and binding themselves by the Blood\nOath. Last of all Yang Hu stepped up, partly from a natural modesty\nwhich restrained him from offering himself when so many more versatile\npersons of proved excellence were willing to engage in the matter, and\npartly because an ill-advised conflict was taking place within his mind\nas to whether the extreme course which was contemplated was the most\nexpedient to pursue. At last, however, he plainly perceived that he\ncould not honourably withhold himself from an affair that was in a\nmeasure the direct outcome of his own unendurable loss, so that without\nfurther hesitation he added his obscure name to the many illustrious\nones already in Tung Fel's keeping.\n\nWhen at length dark fell upon the city and the cries of the watchmen,\nwarning all prudent ones to bar well their doors against robbers,\nas they themselves were withdrawing until the morrow, no longer rang\nthrough the narrow ways of Ching-fow, all those persons who had pledged\nthemselves by name and seal went forth silently, and came together at\nthe place whereof Tung Fel had secretly conveyed them knowledge. There\nTung Fel, standing somewhat apart, placed all the folded papers in the\nform of a circle, and having performed over them certain observances\ndesigned to insure a just decision and to keep away evil influences,\nsubmitted the selection to the discriminating choice of the Sacred\nFlat and Round Sticks. Having in this manner secured the name of\nthe appointed person who should carry out the act of justice and\nretribution, Tung Fel unfolded the paper, inscribed certain words upon\nit, and replaced it among the others.\n\n\"The moment before great deeds,\" began Tung Fel, stepping forward and\naddressing himself to the expectant ones who were gathered round, \"is\nnot the time for light speech, nor, indeed, for sentences of dignified\nlength, no matter how pleasantly turned to the ear they may be. Before\nthis person stand many who are undoubtedly illustrious in various\narts and virtues, yet one among them is pre-eminently marked out for\ndistinction in that his name shall be handed down in imperishable\nhistory as that of a patriot of a pure-minded and uncompromising degree.\nWith him there is no need of further speech, and to this end I have\ninscribed certain words upon his namepaper. To everyone this person will\nnow return the paper which has been entrusted to him, folded so that\nthe nature of its contents shall be an unwritten leaf to all others. Nor\nshall the papers be unfolded by any until he is within his own chamber,\nwith barred doors, where all, save the one who shall find the message,\nshall remain, not venturing forth until daybreak. I, Tung Fel, have\nspoken, and assuredly I shall not eat my word, which is that a certain\nand most degrading death awaits any who transgress these commands.\"\n\nIt was with the short and sudden breath of the cowering antelope when\nthe stealthy tread of the pitiless tiger approaches its lair, that Yang\nHu opened his paper in the seclusion of his own cave; for his mind was\ndarkened with an inspired inside emotion that he, the one doubting among\nthe eagerly proffering and destructively inclined multitude, would\nbe chosen to accomplish the high aim for which, indeed, he felt\nexceptionally unworthy. The written sentence which he perceived\nimmediately upon unfolding the paper, instructing him to appear again\nbefore Tung Fel at the hour of midnight, was, therefore, nothing but\nthe echo and fulfilment of his own thoughts, and served in reality to\nimpress his mind with calmer feelings of dignified unconcern than would\nhave been the case had he not been chosen. Having neither possessions\nnor relations, the occupation of disposing of his goods and making\nceremonious and affectionate leavetakings of his family, against the\noccurrence of any unforeseen disaster, engrossed no portion of Yang Hu's\ntime. Yet there was one matter to which no reference has yet been made,\nbut which now forces itself obtrusively upon the attention, which was\nin a large measure responsible for many of the most prominent actions\nof Yang Hu's life, and, indeed, in no small degree influenced his\nhesitation in offering himself before Tung Fel.\n\nNot a bowshot distance from the place where the mountain path entered\nthe outskirts of the city lived Hiya-ai-Shao with her parents, who\nwere persons of assured position, though of no particular wealth. For a\nperiod not confined to a single year it had been the custom of Yang Hu\nto offer to this elegant and refined maiden all the rarest pieces\nof jade which he could discover, while the most symmetrical and\nremunerative she-goat in his flock enjoyed the honourable distinction of\nbearing her incomparable name. Towards the almond garden of Hiya's abode\nYang Hu turned his footsteps upon leaving his cave, and standing there,\nconcealed from all sides by the white and abundant flower-laden foliage,\nhe uttered a sound which had long been an agreed signal between them.\nPresently a faint perfume of choo-lan spoke of her near approach, and\nwithout delay Hiya herself stood by his side.\n\n\"Well-endowed one,\" said Yang Hu, when at length they had gazed upon\neach other's features and made renewals of their protestations of mutual\nregard, \"the fixed intentions of a person have often been fitly likened\nto the seed of the tree-peony, so ineffectual are their efforts among\nthe winds of constantly changing circumstance. The definite hope of\nthis person had long pointed towards a small but adequate habitation,\nsurrounded by sweet-smelling olive-trees and not far distant from the\njade cliffs and pastures which would afford a sufficient remuneration\nand a means of living. This entrancing picture has been blotted out for\nthe time, and in its place this person finds himself face to face with\nan arduous and dangerous undertaking, followed, perhaps, by hasty and\nimmediate flight. Yet if the adorable Hiya will prove the unchanging\ndepths of her constantly expressed intention by accompanying him as\nfar as the village of Hing where suitable marriage ceremonies can be\nobserved without delay, the exile will in reality be in the nature of\na triumphal procession, and the emotions with which this person has\nhitherto regarded the entire circumstance will undergo a complete and\nhighly accomplished change.\"\n\n\"Oh, Yang!\" exclaimed the maiden, whose feelings at hearing these words\nwere in no way different from those of her lover when he was on the\npoint of opening the folded paper upon which Tung Fel had written; \"what\nis the nature of the mission upon which you are so impetuously resolved?\nand why will it be followed by flight?\"\n\n\"The nature of the undertaking cannot be revealed by reason of a\ndeliberately taken oath,\" replied Yang Hu; \"and the reason of its\npossible consequence is a less important question to the two persons who\nare here conversing together than of whether the amiable and graceful\nHiya is willing to carry out her often-expressed desire for an\nopportunity of displaying the true depths of her emotions towards this\none.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Hiya, \"the sentiments which this person expressed with\nirreproachable honourableness when the sun was high in the heavens and\nthe probability of secretly leaving an undoubtedly well-appointed home\nwas engagingly remote, seem to have an entirely different significance\nwhen recalled by night in a damp orchard, and on the eve of their\nfulfilment. To deceive one's parents is an ignoble prospect;\nfurthermore, it is often an exceedingly difficult undertaking. Let the\nmatter be arranged in this way: that Yang leaves the ultimate details\nof the scheme to Hiya's expedient care, he proceeding without delay\nto Hing, or, even more desirable, to the further town of Liyunnan,\nand there awaiting her coming. By such means the risk of discovery and\npursuit will be lessened, Yang will be able to set forth on his journey\nwith greater speed, and this one will have an opportunity of getting\ntogether certain articles without which, indeed, she would be very\ninadequately equipped.\"\n\nIn spite of his conscientious desire that Hiya should be by his side\non the journey, together with an unendurable certainty that evil would\narise from the course she proposed, Yang was compelled by an innate\nfeeling of respect to agree to her wishes, and in this manner the\narrangement was definitely concluded. Thereupon Hiya, without delay,\nreturned to the dwelling, remarking that otherwise her absence might be\ndetected and the entire circumstance thereby discovered, leaving Yang Hu\nto continue his journey and again present himself before Tung Fel, as he\nhad been instructed.\n\nTung Fel was engaged with brush and ink when Yang Hu entered. Round him\nwere many written parchments, some venerable with age, and a variety\nof other matters, among which might be clearly perceived weapons, and\ndevices for reading the future. He greeted Yang with many tokens of\ndignified respect, and with an evidently restrained emotion led him\ntowards the light of a hanging lantern, where he gazed into his face for\na considerable period with every indication of exceptional concern.\n\n\"Yang Hu,\" he said at length, \"at such a moment many dark and searching\nthoughts may naturally arise in the mind concerning objects and reasons,\nomens, and the moving cycle of events. Yet in all these, out of a wisdom\ngained by deep endurance and a hardly-won experience beyond the common\nlot, this person would say, Be content. The hand of destiny, though it\nmay at times appear to move in a devious manner, is ever approaching its\nappointed aim. To this end were you chosen.\"\n\n\"The choice was openly made by wise and proficient omens,\" replied Yang\nHu, without any display of uncertainty of purpose, \"and this person is\ncontent.\"\n\nTung Fel then administered to Yang the Oath of Buddha's Face and the One\ncalled the Unutterable (which may not be further described in written\nwords) thereby binding his body and soul, and the souls and repose of\nall who had gone before him in direct line and all who should in a like\nmanner follow after, to the accomplishment of the design. All spoken\nmatter being thus complete between them, he gave him a mask with which\nhe should pass unknown through the streets and into the presence of Ping\nSiang, a variety of weapons to use as the occasion arose, and a sign\nby which the attendants at the Yamen would admit him without further\nquestioning.\n\nAs Yang Hu passed through the streets of Ching-fow, which were in a\ngreat measure deserted owing to the command of Tung Fel, he was aware of\nmany mournful and foreboding sounds which accompanied him on all sides,\nwhile shadowy faces, bearing signs of intolerable anguish and despair,\ncontinually formed themselves out of the wind. By the time he reached\nthe Yamen a tempest of exceptional violence was in progress, nor were\nother omens absent which tended to indicate that matters of a very\nunpropitious nature were about to take place.\n\nAt each successive door of the Yamen the attendant stepped back and\ncovered his face, so that he should by no chance perceive who had come\nupon so destructive a mission, the instant Yang Hu uttered the sign with\nwhich Tung Fel had provided him. In this manner Yang quickly reached the\ndoor of the inner chamber upon which was inscribed: \"Let the person who\ncomes with a doubtful countenance, unbidden, or meditating treachery,\nremember the curse and manner of death which attended Lai Kuen, who\nslew the one over him; so shall he turn and go forth in safety.\" This\nunworthy safeguard at the hands of a person who passed his entire life\nin altering the fixed nature of justice, and who never went beyond his\nouter gate without an armed company of bowmen, inspired Yang Hu with\nso incautious a contempt, that without any hesitation he drew forth his\nbrush and ink, and in a spirit of bitter signification added the words,\n\"'Come, let us eat together,' said the wolf to the she-goat.\"\n\nBeing now within a step of Ping Siang and the completion of his\nundertaking, Yang Hu drew tighter the cords of his mask, tested and\nproved his weapons, and then, without further delay, threw open the door\nbefore him and stepped into the chamber, barring the door quickly so\nthat no person might leave or enter without his consent.\n\nAt this interruption and manner of behaving, which clearly indicated\nthe nature of the errand upon which the person before him had come,\nPing Siang rose from his couch and stretched out his hand towards a gong\nwhich lay beside him.\n\n\"All summonses for aid are now unavailing, Ping Siang,\" exclaimed Yang,\nwithout in any measure using delicate or set phrases of speech; \"for,\nas you have doubtless informed yourself, the slaves of tyrants are the\nfirst to welcome the downfall of their lord.\"\n\n\"The matter of your speech is as emptiness to this person,\" replied the\nMandarin, affecting with extreme difficulty an appearance of no-concern.\n\"In what manner has he fallen? And how will the depraved and self-willed\nperson before him avoid the well-deserved tortures which certainly await\nhim in the public square on the morrow, as the reward of his intolerable\npresumptions?\"\n\n\"O Mandarin,\" cried Yang Hu, \"the fitness and occasion for such speeches\nas the one to which you have just given utterance lie as far behind you\nas the smoke of yesterday's sacrifice. With what manner of eyes have you\nfrequently journeyed through Ching-fow of late, if the signs and\nomens there have not already warned you to prepare a coffin adequately\ndesigned to receive your well-proportioned body? Has not the pungent\nvapour of burning houses assailed your senses at every turn, or the salt\ntears from the eyes of forlorn ones dashed your peach-tea and spiced\nfoods with bitterness?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" exclaimed Ping Siang, \"this person now certainly begins to\nperceive that many things which he has unthinkingly allowed would\npresent a very unendurable face to others.\"\n\n\"In such a manner has it appeared to all Ching-fow,\" said Yang Hu; \"and\nthe justice of your death has been universally admitted. Even should\nthis one fail there would be an innumerable company eager to take his\nplace. Therefore, O Ping Siang, as the only favour which it is within\nthis person's power to accord, select that which in your opinion is the\nmost agreeable manner and weapon for your end.\"\n\n\"It is truly said that at the Final Gate of the Two Ways the necessity\nfor elegant and well-chosen sentences ends,\" remarked Ping Siang with a\nsigh, \"otherwise the manner of your address would be open to reproach.\nBy your side this person perceives a long and apparently highly-tempered\nsword, which, in his opinion, will serve the purpose efficiently. Having\nno remarks of an improving but nevertheless exceedingly tedious nature\nwith which to imprint the occasion for the benefit of those who come\nafter, his only request is that the blow shall be an unhesitating and\nsufficiently well-directed one.\"\n\nAt these words Yang Hu threw back his cloak to grasp the sword-handle,\nwhen the Mandarin, with his eyes fixed on the naked arm, and evidently\ninspired by every manner of conflicting emotions, uttered a cry of\nunspeakable wonder and incomparable surprise.\n\n\"The Serpent!\" he cried, in a voice from which all evenness and control\nwere absent. \"The Sacred Serpent of our Race! O mysterious one, who and\nwhence are you?\"\n\nEngulfed in an all-absorbing doubt at the nature of events, Yang could\nonly gaze at the form of the serpent which had been clearly impressed\nupon his arm from the earliest time of his remembrance, while Ping\nSiang, tearing the silk garment from his own arm and displaying thereon\na similar form, continued:\n\n\"Behold the inevitable and unvarying birthmark of our race! So it was\nwith this person's father and the ones before him; so it was with his\ntreacherously-stolen son; so it will be to the end of all time.\"\n\nTrembling beyond all power of restraint, Yang removed the mask which had\nhitherto concealed his face.\n\n\"Father or race has this person none,\" he said, looking into Ping\nSiang's features with an all-engaging hope, tempered in a measure by a\nsoul-benumbing dread; \"nor memory or tradition of an earlier state than\nwhen he herded goats and sought for jade in the southern mountains.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" exclaimed the Mandarin, whose countenance was lightened\nwith an interest and a benevolent emotion which had never been seen\nthere before, \"beyond all possibility of doubting, you are this\nperson's lost and greatly-desired son, stolen away many years ago by\nthe treacherous conduct of an unworthy woman, yet now happily and\nmiraculously restored to cherish his declining years and perpetuate an\nhonourable name and race.\"\n\n\"Happily!\" exclaimed Yang, with fervent indications of uncontrollable\nbitterness. \"Oh, my illustrious sire, at whose venerated feet this\nunworthy person now prostrates himself with well-merited marks of\nreverence and self-abasement, has the errand upon which an ignoble son\nentered--the every memory of which now causes him the acutest agony\nof the lost, but which nevertheless he is pledged to Tung Fel by the\nUnutterable Oath to perform--has this unnatural and eternally cursed\nthing escaped your versatile mind?\"\n\n\"Tung Fel!\" cried Ping Siang. \"Is, then, this blow also by the hand of\nthat malicious and vindictive person? Oh, what a cycle of events and\ninterchanging lines of destiny do your words disclose!\"\n\n\"Who, then, is Tung Fel, my revered Father?\" demanded Yang.\n\n\"It is a matter which must be made clear from the beginning,\" replied\nPing Siang. \"At one time this person and Tung Fel were, by nature\nand endowments, united in the most amiable bonds of an inseparable\nfriendship. Presently Tung Fel signed the preliminary contract of\na marriage with one who seemed to be endowed with every variety of\nenchanting and virtuous grace, but who was, nevertheless, as the\nunrolling of future events irresistibly discovered, a person of\nirregular character and undignified habits. On the eve of the marriage\nceremony this person was made known to her by the undoubtedly enraptured\nTung Fel, whereupon he too fell into the snare of her engaging\npersonality, and putting aside all thoughts of prudent restraint, made\nher more remunerative offers of marriage than Tung Fel could by any\npossible chance overbid. In such a manner--for after the nature of\nher kind riches were exceptionally attractive to her degraded\nimagination--she became this person's wife, and the mother of his only\nson. In spite of these great honours, however, the undoubted perversity\nof her nature made her an easy accomplice to the duplicity of Tung\nFel, who, by means of various disguises, found frequent opportunity of\nuttering in her presence numerous well-thought-out suggestions specially\ndesigned to lead her imagination towards an existence in which this\nperson had no adequate representation. Becoming at length terrified at\nthe possibility of these unworthy emotions, obtruding themselves upon\nthis person's notice, the two in question fled together, taking with\nthem the one who without any doubt is now before me. Despite the most\nassiduous search and very tempting and profitable offers of reward, no\ninformation of a reliable nature could be obtained, and at length\nthis dispirited and completely changed person gave up the pursuit as\nunavailing. With his son and heir, upon whose future he had greatly\nhoped, all emotions of a generous and high-minded nature left him, and\nin a very short space of time he became the avaricious and deservedly\nunpopular individual against whose extortions the amiable and\nlong-suffering ones of Ching-fow have for so many years protested\nmildly. The sudden and not altogether unexpected fate which is now\non the point of reaching him is altogether too lenient to be entirely\nadequate.\"\n\n\"Oh, my distinguished and really immaculate sire!\" cried Yang Hu, in a\nvoice which expressed the deepest feelings of contrition. \"No oaths or\nvows, however sacred, can induce this person to stretch forth his hand\nagainst the one who stands before him.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied Ping Siang, speaking of the matter as though it\nwere one which did not closely concern his own existence, \"to neglect\nthe Unutterable Oath would inevitably involve not only the two persons\nwho are now conversing together, but also those before and those who are\nto come after in direct line, in a much worse condition of affairs. That\nis a fate which this person would by no means permit to exist, for one\nof his chief desires has ever been to establish a strong and vigorous\nline, to which end, indeed, he was even now concluding a marriage\narrangement with the beautiful and refined Hiya-ai-Shao, whom he had\nat length persuaded into accepting his betrothal tokens without\nreluctance.\"\n\n\"Hiya-ai-Shao!\" exclaimed Yang; \"she has accepted your silk-bound\ngifts?\"\n\n\"The matter need not concern us now,\" replied the Mandarin, not\nobserving in his complicated emotions the manner in which the name of\nHiya had affected Yang, revealing as it undoubtedly did the treachery of\nhis beloved one. \"There only appears to be one honourable way in which\nthe full circumstances can be arranged, and this person will in no\nmeasure endeavour to avoid it.\"\n\n\"Such an end is neither ignoble nor painful,\" he said, in an unchanging\nvoice; \"nor will this one in any way shrink from so easy and honourable\na solution.\"\n\n\"The affairs of the future do not exhibit themselves in delicately\ncoloured hues to this person,\" said Yang Hu; \"and he would, if the thing\ncould be so arranged, cheerfully submit to a similar fate in order that\na longer period of existence should be assured to one who has every\nvariety of claim upon his affection.\"\n\n\"The proposal is a graceful and conscientious one,\" said Ping Siang,\n\"and is, moreover, a gratifying omen of the future of our race, which\nmust of necessity be left in your hands. But, for that reason itself,\nsuch a course cannot be pursued. Nevertheless, the events of the past\nfew hours have been of so exceedingly prosperous and agreeable a nature\nthat this short-sighted and frequently desponding person can now\npass beyond with a tranquil countenance and every assurance of divine\nfavour.\"\n\nWith these words Ping Siang indicated that he was desirous of setting\nforth the Final Expression, and arranging the necessary matters upon the\ntable beside him, he stretched forth his hands over Yang Hu, who placed\nhimself in a suitable attitude of reverence and abasement.\n\n\"Yang Hu,\" began the Mandarin, \"undoubted son, and, after the\naccomplishment of the intention which it is our fixed purpose to carry\nout, fitting representative of the person who is here before you,\nengrave well within your mind the various details upon which he now\ngives utterance. Regard the virtues; endeavour to pass an amiable and\nat the same time not unremunerative existence; and on all occasions\nsacrifice freely, to the end that the torments of those who have gone\nbefore may be made lighter, and that others may be induced in turn to\nperform a like benevolent charity for yourself. Having expressed\nhimself upon these general subjects, this person now makes a last and\nrespectfully-considered desire, which it is his deliberate wish should\nbe carried to the proper deities as his final expression of opinion:\nThat Yang Hu may grow as supple as the dried juice of the bending-palm,\nand as straight as the most vigorous bamboo from the forests of the\nNorth. That he may increase beyond the prolificness of the white-necked\ncrow and cover the ground after the fashion of the binding grass.\nThat in battle his sword may be as a vividly-coloured and many-forked\nlightning flash, accompanied by thunderbolts as irresistible as Buddha's\ndivine wrath; in peace his voice as resounding as the rolling of many\npowerful drums among the Khingan Mountains. That when the kindled fire\nof his existence returns to the great Mountain of Pure Flame the earth\nshall accept again its component parts, and in no way restrain the\ndivine essence from journeying to its destined happiness. These words\nare Ping Siang's last expression of opinion before he passes beyond,\ngiven in the unvarying assurance that so sacred and important a petition\nwill in no way be neglected.\"\n\nHaving in this manner completed all the affairs which seemed to be of\na necessary and urgent nature, and fixing his last glance upon Yang Hu\nwith every variety of affectionate and estimable emotion, the Mandarin\ndrank a sufficient quantity of the liquid, and placing himself upon a\ncouch in an attitude of repose, passed in this dignified and unassuming\nmanner into the Upper Air.\n\nAfter the space of a few moments spent in arranging certain objects and\nin inward contemplation, Yang Hu crossed the chamber, still holding\nthe half-filled vessel of gold-leaf in his hand, and drawing back the\nhanging silk, gazed over the silent streets of Ching-fow and towards the\ngreat sky-lantern above.\n\n\"Hiya is faithless,\" he said at length in an unspeaking voice; \"this\nperson's mother a bitter-tasting memory, his father a swiftly passing\nshadow that is now for ever lost.\" His eyes rested upon the closed\nvessel in his hand. \"Gladly would--\" his thoughts began, but with\nthis unworthy image a new impression formed itself within his mind. \"A\nclearly-expressed wish was uttered,\" he concluded, \"and Tung Fel still\nremains.\" With this resolution he stepped back into the chamber and\nstruck the gong loudly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE CAREER OF THE CHARITABLE QUEN-KI-TONG\n\n\n                  FIRST PERIOD: THE PUBLIC OFFICIAL\n\n\"The motives which inspired the actions of the devout Quen-Ki-Tong have\nlong been ill-reported,\" said Kai Lung the story-teller, upon a certain\noccasion at Wu-whei, \"and, as a consequence, his illustrious memory has\nsuffered somewhat. Even as the insignificant earth-worm may bring\nthe precious and many coloured jewel to the surface, so has it been\npermitted to this obscure and superficially educated one to discover\nthe truth of the entire matter among the badly-arranged and frequently\nreally illegible documents preserved at the Hall of Public Reference at\nPeking. Without fear of contradiction, therefore, he now sets forth the\ncredible version.\n\n\"Quen-Ki-Tong was one who throughout his life had been compelled by\nthe opposing force of circumstances to be content with what was offered\nrather than attain to that which he desired. Having been allowed to\nwander over the edge of an exceedingly steep crag, while still a child,\nby the aged and untrustworthy person who had the care of him, and yet\nsuffering little hurt, he was carried back to the city in triumph,\nby the one in question, who, to cover her neglect, declared amid\nmany chants of exultation that as he slept a majestic winged form had\nsnatched him from her arms and traced magical figures with his body on\nthe ground in token of the distinguished sacred existence for which he\nwas undoubtedly set apart. In such a manner he became famed at a very\nearly age for an unassuming mildness of character and an almost inspired\npiety of life, so that on every side frequent opportunity was given him\nfor the display of these amiable qualities. Should it chance that an\ninsufficient quantity of puppy-pie had been prepared for the family\nrepast, the undesirable but necessary portion of cold dried rat would\ninevitably be allotted to the uncomplaining Quen, doubtless accompanied\nby the engaging but unnecessary remark that he alone had a Heaven-sent\nintellect which was fixed upon more sublime images than even the\nbest constructed puppy-pie. Should the number of sedan-chairs not be\nsufficient to bear to the Exhibition of Kites all who were desirous of\nbecoming entertained in such a fashion, inevitably would Quen be the one\nleft behind, in order that he might have adequate leisure for dignified\nand pure-minded internal reflexion.\n\n\"In this manner it came about that when a very wealthy but unnaturally\navaricious and evil-tempered person who was connected with Quen's father\nin matters of commerce expressed his fixed determination that the most\ndeserving and enlightened of his friend's sons should enter into a\nmarriage agreement with his daughter, there was no manner of hesitation\namong those concerned, who admitted without any questioning between\nthemselves that Quen was undeniably the one referred to.\n\n\"Though naturally not possessing an insignificant intellect, a\ncontinuous habit, together with a most irreproachable sense of filial\nduty, subdued within Quen's internal organs whatever reluctance he might\nhave otherwise displayed in the matter, so that as courteously as was\nnecessary he presented to the undoubtedly very ordinary and slow-witted\nmaiden in question the gifts of irretrievable intention, and honourably\ncarried out his spoken and written words towards her.\n\n\"For a period of years the circumstances of the various persons did not\nin any degree change, Quen in the meantime becoming more pure-souled\nand inward-seeing with each moon-change, after the manner of the sublime\nLien-ti, who studied to maintain an unmoved endurance in all varieties\nof events by placing his body to a greater extent each day in a vessel\nof boiling liquid. Nevertheless, the good and charitable deities to\nwhom Quen unceasingly sacrificed were not altogether unmindful of his\nvirtues; for a son was born, and an evil disease which arose from a most\nundignified display of uncontrollable emotion on her part ended in his\nwife being deposited with becoming ceremony in the Family Temple.\n\n\"Upon a certain evening, when Quen sat in his inner chamber deliberating\nupon the really beneficent yet somewhat inexplicable arrangement of the\nall-seeing ones to whom he was very amiably disposed in consequence of\nthe unwonted tranquillity which he now enjoyed, yet who, it appeared to\nhim, could have set out the entire matter in a much more satisfactory\nway from the beginning, he was made aware by the unexpected beating of\nmany gongs, and by other signs of refined and deferential welcome, that\na person of exalted rank was approaching his residence. While he was\nstill hesitating in his uncertainty regarding the most courteous and\ndelicate form of self-abasement with which to honour so important a\nvisitor--whether to rush forth and allow the chair-carriers to pass over\nhis prostrate form, to make a pretence of being a low-caste slave, and\nin that guise doing menial service, or to conceal himself beneath\na massive and overhanging table until his guest should have availed\nhimself of the opportunity to examine at his leisure whatever the room\ncontained--the person in question stood before him. In every detail of\ndress and appointment he had the undoubted appearance of being one to\nwhom no door might be safely closed.\n\n\"'Alas!' exclaimed Quen, 'how inferior and ill-contrived is the mind\nof a person of my feeble intellectual attainments. Even at this moment,\nwhen the near approach of one who obviously commands every engaging\naccomplishment might reasonably be expected to call up within it an\nadequate amount of commonplace resource, its ill-destined possessor\nfinds himself entirely incapable of conducting himself with the fitting\noutward marks of his great internal respect. This residence is certainly\nunprepossessing in the extreme, yet it contains many objects of some\nvalue and of great rarity; illiterate as this person is, he would not\nbe so presumptuous as to offer any for your acceptance, but if you will\nconfer upon him the favour of selecting that which appears to be the\nmost priceless and unreplaceable, he will immediately, and with every\nmanifestation of extreme delight, break it irredeemably in your honour,\nto prove the unaffected depth of his gratified emotions.'\n\n\"'Quen-Ki-Tong,' replied the person before him, speaking with an evident\nsincerity of purpose, 'pleasant to this one's ears are your words,\nbreathing as they do an obvious hospitality and a due regard for the\nforms of etiquette. But if, indeed, you are desirous of gaining this\nperson's explicit regard, break no articles of fine porcelain or rare\ninlaid wood in proof of it, but immediately dismiss to a very distant\nspot the three-score gong-beaters who have enclosed him within two solid\nrings, and who are now carrying out their duties in so diligent a manner\nthat he greatly doubts if the unimpaired faculties of hearing will ever\nbe fully restored. Furthermore, if your exceedingly amiable intentions\ndesire fuller expression, cause an unstinted number of vessels of some\nuninflammable liquid to be conveyed into your chrysanthemum garden and\nthere poured over the numerous fireworks and coloured lights which still\nappear to be in progress. Doubtless they are well-intentioned marks of\nrespect, but they caused this person considerable apprehension as he\npassed among them, and, indeed, give to this unusually pleasant and\nunassuming spot the by no means inviting atmosphere of a low-class\ntea-house garden during the festivities attending the birthday of the\nsacred Emperor.'\n\n\"'This person is overwhelmed with a most unendurable confusion that the\nmatters referred to should have been regarded in such a light,' replied\nQuen humbly. 'Although he himself had no knowledge of them until this\nmoment, he is confident that they in no wise differ from the usual\nhonourable manifestations with which it is customary in this Province to\nwelcome strangers of exceptional rank and titles.'\n\n\"'The welcome was of a most dignified and impressive nature,' replied\nthe stranger, with every appearance of not desiring to cause Quen any\nuneasy internal doubts; 'yet the fact is none the less true that at the\nmoment this person's head seems to contain an exceedingly powerful and\nwell-equipped band; and also, that as he passed through the courtyard\nan ingeniously constructed but somewhat unmanageable figure of gigantic\nsize, composed entirely of jets of many-coloured flame, leaped out\nsuddenly from behind a dark wall and made an almost successful attempt\nto embrace him in its ever-revolving arms. Lo Yuen greatly fears that\nthe time when he would have rejoiced in the necessary display of agility\nto which the incident gave rise has for ever passed away.'\n\n\"'Lo Yuen!' exclaimed Quen, with an unaffected mingling of the emotions\nof reverential awe and pleasureable anticipation. 'Can it indeed be\nan uncontroversial fact that so learned and ornamental a person as the\nrenowned Controller of Unsolicited Degrees stands beneath this inelegant\nperson's utterly unpresentable roof! Now, indeed, he plainly understands\nwhy this ill-conditioned chamber has the appearance of being filled with\na Heaven-sent brilliance, and why at the first spoken words of the one\nbefore him a melodious sound, like the rushing waters of the sacred\nTien-Kiang, seemed to fill his ears.'\n\n\"'Undoubtedly the chamber is pervaded by a very exceptional splendour,'\nreplied Lo Yuen, who, in spite of his high position, regarded graceful\ntalk and well-imagined compliments in a spirit of no-satisfaction; 'yet\nthis commonplace-minded one has a fixed conviction that it is caused\nby the crimson-eyed and pink-fire-breathing dragon which, despite your\nslave's most assiduous efforts, is now endeavouring to climb through\nthe aperture behind you. The noise which still fills his ears, also,\nresembles rather the despairing cries of the Ten Thousand Lost Ones at\nthe first sight of the Pit of Liquid and Red-hot Malachite, yet\nwithout question both proceed from the same cause. Laying aside further\nceremony, therefore, permit this greatly over-estimated person to\ndisclose the object of his inopportune visit. Long have your amiable\nvirtues been observed and appreciated by the high ones at Peking, O\nQuen-Ki-Tong. Too long have they been unrewarded and passed over in\nsilence. Nevertheless, the moment of acknowledgement and advancement has\nat length arrived; for, as the Book of Verses clearly says, \"Even the\nthree-legged mule may contrive to reach the agreed spot in advance of\nthe others, provided a circular running space has been selected and\nthe number of rounds be sufficiently ample.\" It is this otherwise\nuninteresting and obtrusive person's graceful duty to convey to you the\nagreeable intelligence that the honourable and not ill-rewarded office\nof Guarder of the Imperial Silkworms has been conferred upon you, and\nto require you to proceed without delay to Peking, so that fitting\nceremonies of admittance may be performed before the fifteenth day of\nthe month of Feathered Insects.'\n\n\"Alas! how frequently does the purchaser of seemingly vigorous and\nexceptionally low-priced flower-seeds discover, when too late, that they\nare, in reality, fashioned from the root of the prolific and valueless\ntzu-ka, skilfully covered with a disguising varnish! Instead of\npresenting himself at the place of commerce frequented by those who\nentrust money to others on the promise of an increased repayment when\ncertain very probable events have come to pass (so that if all\nelse failed he would still possess a serviceable number of taels),\nQuen-Ki-Tong entirely neglected the demands of a most ordinary prudence,\nnor could he be induced to set out on his journey until he had passed\nseven days in public feasting to mark his good fortune, and then devoted\nfourteen more days to fasting and various acts of penance, in order to\nmake known the regret with which he acknowledged his entire unworthiness\nfor the honour before him. Owing to this very conscientious, but\nnevertheless somewhat short-sighted manner of behaving, Quen found\nhimself unable to reach Peking before the day preceding that to which Lo\nYuen had made special reference. From this cause it came about that only\nsufficient time remained to perform the various ceremonies of admission,\nwithout in any degree counselling Quen as to his duties and procedure in\nthe fulfilment of his really important office.\n\n\"Among the many necessary and venerable ceremonies observed during the\nchanging periods of the year, none occupy a more important place than\nthose for which the fifteenth day of the month of Feathered Insects is\nreserved, conveying as they do a respectful and delicately-fashioned\npetition that the various affairs upon which persons in every\ncondition of life are engaged may arrive at a pleasant and remunerative\nconclusion. At the earliest stroke of the gong the versatile Emperor,\naccompanied by many persons of irreproachable ancestry and certain\nothers, very elaborately attired, proceeds to an open space set apart\nfor the occasion. With unassuming dexterity the benevolent Emperor for\na brief span of time engages in the menial occupation of a person of\nlow class, and with his own hands ploughs an assigned portion of land in\norder that the enlightened spirits under whose direct guardianship the\nearth is placed may not become lax in their disinterested efforts to\npromote its fruitfulness. In this charitable exertion he is followed\nby various other persons of recognized position, the first being, by\ncustom, the Guarder of the Imperial Silkworms, while at the same time\nthe amiably-disposed Empress plants an allotted number of mulberry\ntrees, and deposits upon their leaves the carefully reared insects\nwhich she receives from the hands of their Guarder. In the case of the\naccomplished Emperor an ingenious contrivance is resorted to by which\nthe soil is drawn aside by means of hidden strings as the plough passes\nby, the implement in question being itself constructed from paper of the\nhighest quality, while the oxen which draw it are, in reality,\nordinary persons cunningly concealed within masks of cardboard. In this\nthoughtful manner the actual labours of the sublime Emperor are greatly\nlessened, while no chance is afforded for an inauspicious omen to be\ncreated by the rebellious behaviour of a maliciously-inclined ox, or by\nany other event of an unforeseen nature. All the other persons, however,\nare required to make themselves proficient in the art of ploughing,\nbefore the ceremony, so that the chances of the attendant spirits\ndiscovering the deception which has been practised upon them in the case\nof the Emperor may not be increased by its needless repetition. It was\nchiefly for this reason that Lo Yuen had urged Quen to journey to Peking\nas speedily as possible, but owing to the very short time which remained\nbetween his arrival and the ceremony of ploughing, not only had the\nperson in question neglected to profit by instruction, but he was not\neven aware of the obligation which awaited him. When, therefore, in\nspite of every respectful protest on his part, he was led up to a\nmassively-constructed implement drawn by two powerful and undeniably\nevilly-intentioned-looking animals, it was with every sign of great\ninternal misgivings, and an entire absence of enthusiasm in the\nentertainment, that he commenced his not too well understood task. In\nthis matter he was by no means mistaken, for it soon became plain to all\nobservers--of whom an immense concourse was assembled--that the usually\nself-possessed Guarder of the Imperial Silkworms was conducting\nhimself in a most undignified manner; for though he still clung to the\nplough-handles with an inspired tenacity, his body assumed every variety\nof base and uninviting attitude. Encouraged by this inelegant state\nof affairs, the evil spirits which are ever on the watch to turn into\nderision the charitable intentions of the pure-minded entered into\nthe bodies of the oxen and provoked within their minds a sudden and\nmalignant confidence that the time had arrived when they might with\nsafety break into revolt and throw off the outward signs of their\ndependent condition. From these various causes it came about that Quen\nwas, without warning, borne with irresistible certainty against the\nmajestic person of the sacred Emperor, the inlaid box of Imperial\nsilkworms, which up to that time had remained safely among the folds\nof his silk garment, alone serving to avert an even more violent and\nill-destined blow.\n\n\"Well said the wise and deep-thinking Ye-te, in his book entitled\n_Proverbs of Everyday Happenings_, 'Should a person on returning from\nthe city discover his house to be in flames, let him examine well the\nchange which he has received from the chair-carrier before it is too\nlate; for evil never travels alone.' Scarcely had the unfortunate Quen\nrecovered his natural attributes from the effect of the disgraceful\noccurrence which has been recorded (which, indeed, furnished the matter\nof a song and many unpresentable jests among the low-class persons\nof the city), than the magnanimous Empress reached that detail of the\ntree-planting ceremony when it was requisite that she should deposit the\nliving emblems of the desired increase and prosperity upon the leaves.\nStretching forth her delicately-proportioned hand to Quen for this\npurpose, she received from the still greatly confused person in question\nthe Imperial silkworms in so unseemly a condition that her eyes had\nscarcely rested upon them before she was seized with the rigid\nsickness, and in that state fell to the ground. At this new and entirely\nunforeseen calamity a very disagreeable certainty of approaching evil\nbegan to take possession of all those who stood around, many crying\naloud that every omen of good was wanting, and declaring that unless\nsomething of a markedly propitiatory nature was quickly accomplished,\nthe agriculture of the entire Empire would cease to flourish, and the\nvarious departments of the commerce in silk would undoubtedly be thrown\ninto a state of most inextricable confusion. Indeed, in spite of all\nthings designed to have a contrary effect, the matter came about in the\nway predicted, for the Hoang-Ho seven times overcame its restraining\nbarriers, and poured its waters over the surrounding country, thereby\ngaining for the first time its well-deserved title of 'The Sorrow of\nChina,' by which dishonourable but exceedingly appropriate designation\nit is known to this day.\n\n\"The manner of greeting which would have been accorded to Quen had\nhe returned to the official quarter of the city, or the nature of his\ntreatment by the baser class of the ordinary people if they succeeded\nin enticing him to come among them, formed a topic of such uninviting\nconjecture that the humane-minded Lo Yuen, who had observed the\nentire course of events from an elevated spot, determined to make\na well-directed effort towards his safety. To this end he quickly\npurchased the esteem of several of those who make a profession of their\nstrength, holding out the hope of still further reward if they conducted\nthe venture to a successful termination. Uttering loud cries of an\nimpending vengeance, as Lo Yuen had instructed them in the matter,\nand displaying their exceptional proportions to the astonishment and\nmisgivings of all beholders, these persons tore open the opium-tent in\nwhich Quen had concealed himself, and, thrusting aside all opposition,\nquickly dragged him forth. Holding him high upon their shoulders, in\nspite of his frequent and ill-advised endeavours to cast himself to\nthe ground, some surrounded those who bore him--after the manner of\ndisposing his troops affected by a skilful leader when the enemy begin\nto waver--and crying aloud that it was their unchanging purpose to\nsubmit him to the test of burning splinters and afterwards to torture\nhim, they succeeded by this stratagem in bringing him through the\ncrowd; and hurling back or outstripping those who endeavoured to follow,\nconveyed him secretly and unperceived to a deserted and appointed\nspot. Here Quen was obliged to remain until other events caused the\nrecollection of the many to become clouded and unconcerned towards him,\nsuffering frequent inconveniences in spite of the powerful protection\nof Lo Yuen, and not at all times being able to regard the most necessary\nrepast as an appointment of undoubted certainty. At length, in the guise\nof a wandering conjurer who was unable to display his accomplishments\nowing to an entire loss of the power of movement in his arms, Quen\npassed undetected from the city, and safely reaching the distant and\nunimportant town of Lu-Kwo, gave himself up to a protracted period of\nlamentation and self-reproach at the unprepossessing manner in which he\nhad conducted his otherwise very inviting affairs.\n\n\n                  SECOND PERIOD: THE TEMPLE BUILDER\n\nTwo hand-counts of years passed away and Quen still remained at Lu-kwo,\nall desire of returning either to Peking or to the place of his birth\nhaving by this time faded into nothingness. Accepting the inevitable\nfact that he was not destined ever to become a person with whom taels\nwere plentiful, and yet being unwilling to forego the charitable manner\nof life which he had always been accustomed to observe, it came about\nthat he spent the greater part of his time in collecting together such\nsums of money as he could procure from the amiable and well-disposed,\nand with them building temples and engaging in other benevolent works.\nFrom this cause it arose the Quen obtained around Lu-kwo a reputation\nfor high-minded piety, in no degree less than that which had been\nconferred upon him in earlier times, so that pilgrims from far distant\nplaces would purposely contrive their journey so as to pass through the\ntown containing so unassuming and virtuous a person.\n\n\"During this entire period Quen had been accompanied by his only son, a\nyouth of respectful personality, in whose entertaining society he took\nan intelligent interest. Even when deeply engaged in what he justly\nregarded as the crowning work of his existence--the planning and\nerecting of an exceptionally well-endowed marble temple, which was to\nbe entirely covered on the outside with silver paper, and on the inside\nwith gold-leaf--he did not fail to observe the various conditions of\nLiao's existence, and the changing emotions which from time to\ntime possessed him. Therefore, when the person in question, without\ndisplaying any signs of internal sickness, and likewise persistently\ndenying that he had lost any considerable sum of money, disclosed a\ncontinuous habit of turning aside with an unaffected expression of\ndistaste from all manner of food, and passed the entire night in\nobserving the course of the great sky-lantern rather than in sleep, the\nsage and discriminating Quen took him one day aside, and asked him, as\none who might aid him in the matter, who the maiden was, and what class\nand position her father occupied.\n\n\"'Alas!' exclaimed Liao, with many unfeigned manifestations of an\nunbearable fate, 'to what degree do the class and position of her\nentirely unnecessary parents affect the question? or how little hope\ncan this sacrilegious one reasonably have of ever progressing as far as\nearthly details of a pecuniary character in the case of so adorable and\nfar-removed a Being? The uttermost extent of this wildly-hoping person's\nambition is that when the incomparably symmetrical Ts'ain learns of\nthe steadfast light of his devotion, she may be inspired to deposit an\nemblematic chrysanthemum upon his tomb in the Family Temple. For such a\nreward he will cheerfully devote the unswerving fidelity of a lifetime\nto her service, not distressing her gentle and retiring nature by the\nexpression of what must inevitably be a hopeless passion, but patiently\nand uncomplainingly guarding her footsteps as from a distance.'\n\n\"Being in this manner made aware of the reason of Liao's frequent and\nunrestrained exclamations of intolerable despair, and of his fixed\ndetermination with regard to the maiden Ts'ain (which seemed, above\nall else, to indicate a resolution to shun her presence) Quen could not\nregard the immediately-following actions of his son with anything but an\nemotion of confusion. For when his eyes next rested upon the exceedingly\ncontradictory Liao, he was seated in the open space before the house in\nwhich Ts'ain dwelt, playing upon an instrument of stringed woods, and\nchanting verses into which the names of the two persons in question\nhad been skilfully introduced without restraint, his whole manner of\nbehaving being with the evident purpose of attracting the maiden's\nfavourable attention. After an absence of many days, spent in this\ngraceful and complimentary manner, Liao returned suddenly to the house\nof his father, and, prostrating his body before him, made a specific\nrequest for his assistance.\n\n\"'As regards Ts'ain and myself,' he continued, 'all things are arranged,\nand but for the unfortunate coincidence of this person's poverty and\nof her father's cupidity, the details of the wedding ceremony would\nundoubtedly now be in a very advanced condition. Upon these entrancing\nand well-discussed plans, however, the shadow of the grasping and\ncommonplace Ah-Ping has fallen like the inopportune opium-pipe from the\nmouth of a person examining substances of an explosive nature; for the\none referred to demands a large and utterly unobtainable amount of taels\nbefore he will suffer his greatly-sought-after daughter to accept the\ngifts of irretrievable intention.'\n\n\"'Grievous indeed is your plight,' replied Quen, when he thus understood\nthe manner of obstacle which impeded his son's hopes; 'for in the nature\nof taels the most diverse men are to be measured through the same mesh.\nAs the proverb says, \"'All money is evil,' exclaimed the philosopher\nwith extreme weariness, as he gathered up the gold pieces in exchange,\nbut presently discovering that one among them was such indeed has he had\ndescribed, he rushed forth without tarrying to take up a street garment;\nand with an entire absence of dignity traversed all the ways of the city\nin the hope of finding the one who had defrauded him.\" Well does this\nperson know the mercenary Ah-Ping, and the unyielding nature of his\nclosed hand; for often, but always fruitlessly, he has entered his\npresence on affairs connected with the erecting of certain temples.\nNevertheless, the matter is one which does not admit of any incapable\nfaltering, to which end this one will seek out the obdurate Ah-Ping\nwithout delay, and endeavour to entrap him by some means in the course\nof argument.'\n\n\"From the time of his earliest youth Ah-Ping had unceasingly devoted\nhimself to the object of getting together an overwhelming number of\ntaels, using for this purpose various means which, without being really\ndegrading or contrary to the written law, were not such as might have\nbeen cheerfully engaged in by a person of high-minded honourableness. In\nconsequence of this, as he grew more feeble in body, and more venerable\nin appearance, he began to express frequent and bitter doubts as to\nwhether his manner of life had been really well arranged; for, in spite\nof his great wealth, he had grown to adopt a most inexpensive habit\non all occasions, having no desire to spend; and an ever-increasing\napprehension began to possess him that after he had passed beyond, his\nsons would be very disinclined to sacrifice and burn money sufficient to\nkeep him in an affluent condition in the Upper Air. In such a state of\nmind was Ah-Ping when Quen-Ki-Tong appeared before him, for it had just\nbeen revealed to him that his eldest and favourite son had, by flattery\nand by openly praising the dexterity with which he used his brush\nand ink, entrapped him into inscribing his entire name upon certain\nunwritten sheets of parchment, which the one in question immediately\nsold to such as were heavily indebted to Ah-Ping.\n\n\"'If a person can be guilty of this really unfilial behaviour during the\nlifetime of his father,' exclaimed Ah-Ping, in a tone of unrestrained\nvexation, 'can it be prudently relied upon that he will carry out his\nwishes after death, when they involve the remitting to him of several\nthousand taels each year? O estimable Quen-Ki-Tong, how immeasurably\nsuperior is the celestial outlook upon which you may safely rely as your\nportion! When you are enjoying every variety of sumptuous profusion,\nas the reward of your untiring charitable exertions here on earth, the\nspirit of this short-sighted person will be engaged in doing menial\nservitude for the inferior deities, and perhaps scarcely able, even by\nthose means, to clothe himself according to the changing nature of the\nseasons.'\n\n\"'Yet,' replied Quen, 'the necessity for so laborious and unremunerative\nan existence may even now be averted by taking efficient precautions\nbefore you pass to the Upper Air.'\n\n\"'In what way?' demanded Ah-Ping, with an awakening hope that the matter\nmight not be entirely destitute of cheerfulness, yet at the same time\npreparing to examine with even unbecoming intrusiveness any expedient\nwhich Quen might lay before him. 'Is it not explicitly stated that\nsacrifices and acts of a like nature, when performed at the end of one's\nexistence by a person who to that time has professed no sort of interest\nin such matters, shall in no degree be entered as to his good, but\nrather regarded as examples of deliberate presumptuousness, and made the\nexcuse for subjecting him to more severe tortures and acts of penance\nthan would be his portion if he neglected the custom altogether?'\n\n\"'Undoubtedly such is the case,' replied Quen; 'and on that account it\nwould indicate a most regrettable want of foresight for you to conduct\nyour affairs in the manner indicated. The only undeniably safe course\nis for you to entrust the amount you will require to a person of\nexceptional piety, receiving in return his written word to repay the\nfull sum whenever you shall claim it from him in the Upper Air. By this\ncrafty method the amount will be placed at the disposal of the person\nin question as soon as he has passed beyond, and he will be held by his\nwritten word to return it to you whenever you shall demand it.'\n\n\"So amiably impressed with this ingenious scheme was Ah-Ping that he\nwould at once have entered more fully into the detail had the thought\nnot arisen in his mind that the person before him was the father of\nLiao, who urgently required a certain large sum, and that for this\nreason he might with prudence inquire more fully into the matter\nelsewhere, in case Quen himself should have been imperceptibly led\naside, even though he possessed intentions of a most unswerving\nhonourableness. To this end, therefore, he desired to converse again\nwith Quen on the matter, pleading that at that moment a gathering\nof those who direct enterprises of a commercial nature required his\npresence. Nevertheless, he would not permit the person referred to\ndepart until he had complimented him, in both general and specific\nterms, on the high character of his life and actions, and the\nintelligent nature of his understanding, which had enabled him with so\nlittle mental exertion to discover an efficient plan.\n\n\"Without delay Ah-Ping sought out those most skilled in all varieties\nof law-forms, in extorting money by devices capable of very different\nmeanings, and in expedients for evading just debts; but all agreed that\nsuch an arrangement as the one he put before them would be unavoidably\nbinding, provided the person who received the money alluded to spent it\nin the exercise of his charitable desires, and provided also that the\nwritten agreement bore the duty seal of the high ones at Peking, and was\ndeposited in the coffin of the lender. Fully satisfied, and rejoicing\ngreatly that he could in this way adequately provide for his future and\nentrap the avaricious ones of his house, Ah-Ping collected together the\ngreater part of his possessions, and converting it into pieces of gold,\nentrusted them to Quen on the exact understanding that has already been\ndescribed, he receiving in turn Quen's written and thumb-signed paper\nof repayment, and his assurance that the whole amount should be expended\nupon the silver-paper and gold-leaf Temple with which he was still\nengaged.\n\n\"It is owing to this circumstance that Quen-Ki-Tong's irreproachable\nname has come to be lightly regarded by many who may be fitly likened to\nthe latter person in the subtle and experienced proverb, 'The wise man's\neyes fell before the gaze of the fool, fearing that if he looked he\nmust cry aloud, \"Thou hopeless one!\" \"There,\" said the fool to himself,\n\"behold this person's power!\"' These badly educated and undiscriminating\npersons, being entirely unable to explain the ensuing train of events,\nunhesitatingly declare that Quen-Ki-Tong applied a portion of the money\nwhich he had received from Ah-Ping in the manner described to the object\nof acquiring Ts'ain for his son Liao. In this feeble and incapable\nfashion they endeavour to stigmatize the pure-minded Quen as one who\nacted directly contrary to his deliberately spoken word, whereas the\ndesired result was brought about in a much more artful manner; they\ndescribe the commercially successful Ah-Ping as a person of very\ninferior prudence, and one easily imposed upon; while they entirely pass\nover, as a detail outside the true facts, the written paper preserved\namong the sacred relics in the Temple, which announces, among other\ngifts of a small and uninviting character, 'Thirty thousand taels from\nan elderly ginseng merchant of Lu-kwo, who desires to remain nameless,\nthrough the hand of Quen-Ki-Tong.' The full happening in its real and\nharmless face is now set forth for the first time.\n\n\"Some weeks after the recorded arrangement had been arrived at by\nAh-Ping and Quen, when the taels in question had been expended upon the\nTemple and were, therefore, infallibly beyond recall, the former person\nchanced to be passing through the public garden in Lu-kwo when he heard\na voice lifted up in the expression of every unendurable feeling of\ndejection to which one can give utterance. Stepping aside to learn the\ncause of so unprepossessing a display of unrestrained agitation, and\nin the hope that perhaps he might be able to use the incident in a\nremunerative manner, Ah-Ping quickly discovered the unhappy being who,\nentirely regardless of the embroidered silk robe which he wore, reclined\nupon a raised bank of uninviting earth, and waved his hands from side to\nside as his internal emotions urged him.\n\n\"'Quen-Ki-Tong!' exclaimed Ah-Ping, not fully convinced that the fact\nwas as he stated it in spite of the image clearly impressed upon his\nimagination; 'to what unpropitious occurrence is so unlooked-for an\nexhibition due? Are those who traffic in gold-leaf demanding a high and\nprohibitive price for that commodity, or has some evil and vindicative\nspirit taken up its abode within the completed portion of the Temple,\nand by its offensive but nevertheless diverting remarks and actions\nremoved all semblance of gravity from the countenances of those who\ndaily come to admire the construction?'\n\n\"'O thrice unfortunate Ah-Ping,' replied Quen when he observed the\ndistinguishing marks of the person before him, 'scarcely can this\ngreatly overwhelmed one raise his eyes to your open and intelligent\ncountenance; for through him you are on the point of experiencing a very\nsevere financial blow, and it is, indeed, on your account more than on\nhis own that he is now indulging in these outward signs of a grief too\nfar down to be expressed in spoken words.' And at the memory of his\nformer occupation, Quen again waved his arms from side to side with\nuntiring assiduousness.\n\n\"'Strange indeed to this person's ears are your words,' said Ah-Ping,\noutwardly unmoved, but with an apprehensive internal pain that he would\nhave regarded Quen's display of emotion with an easier stomach if his\nown taels were safely concealed under the floor of his inner chamber.\n'The sum which this one entrusted to you has, without any pretence\nbeen expended upon the Temple, while the written paper concerning the\nrepayment bears the duty seal of the high ones at Peking. How, then, can\nAh-Ping suffer a loss at the hands of Quen-Ki-Tong?'\n\n\"'Ah-Ping,' said Quen, with every appearance of desiring that both\npersons should regard the matter in a conciliatory spirit, 'do not\npermit the awaiting demons, which are ever on the alert to enter into\na person's mind when he becomes distressed out of the common order of\nevents, to take possession of your usually discriminating faculties\nuntil you have fully understood how this affair has come about. It is no\nunknown thing for a person of even exceptional intelligence to reverse\nhis entire manner of living towards the end of a long and consistent\nexistence; the far-seeing and not lightly-moved Ah-Ping himself has\nalready done so. In a similar, but entirely contrary manner, the person\nwho is now before you finds himself impelled towards that which will\ncertainly bear a very unpresentable face when the circumstances\nbecome known; yet by no other means is he capable of attaining his\ngreatly-desired object.'\n\n\"'And to what end does that trend?' demanded Ah-Ping, in no degree\nunderstanding how the matter affected him.\n\n\"'While occupied with enterprises which those of an engaging and\ncomplimentary nature are accustomed to refer to as charitable,\nthis person has almost entirely neglected a duty of scarcely less\nimportance--that of establishing an unending line, through which his\nname and actions shall be kept alive to all time,' replied Quen. 'Having\nnow inquired into the matter, he finds that his only son, through whom\nalone the desired result can be obtained, has become unbearably attached\nto a maiden for whom a very large sum is demanded in exchange. The\nthought of obtaining no advantage from an entire life of self-denial\nis certainly unprepossessing in the extreme, but so, even to a more\nadvanced degree, is the certainty that otherwise the family monuments\nwill be untended, and the temple of domestic virtues become an early\nruin. This person has submitted the dilemma to the test of omens, and\nafter considering well the reply, he has decided to obtain the price of\nthe maiden in a not very honourable manner, which now presents itself,\nso that Liao may send out his silk-bound gifts without delay.'\n\n\"'It is an unalluring alternative,' said Ah-Ping, whose only inside\nthought was one of gratification that the exchange money for Ts'ain\nwould so soon be in his possession, 'yet this person fails to perceive\nhow you could act otherwise after the decision of the omens. He now\nunderstands, moreover, that the loss you referred to on his part was in\nthe nature of a figure of speech, as one makes use of thunderbolts\nand delicately-scented flowers to convey ideas of harsh and amiable\npassions, and alluded in reality to the forthcoming departure of his\ndaughter, who is, as you so versatilely suggested, the comfort and\nriches of his old age.'\n\n\"'O venerable, but at this moment somewhat obtuse, Ah-Ping,' cried\nQuen, with a recurrence to his former method of expressing his unfeigned\nagitation, 'is your evenly-balanced mind unable to grasp the essential\nfact of how this person's contemplated action will affect your own\ncelestial condition? It is a distressing but entirely unavoidable fact,\nthat if this person acts in the manner which he has determined upon, he\nwill be condemned to the lowest place of torment reserved for those\nwho fail at the end of an otherwise pure existence, and in this he\nwill never have an opportunity of meeting the very much higher placed\nAh-Ping, and of restoring to him the thirty-thousand taels as agreed\nupon.'\n\n\"At these ill-destined words, all power of rigidness departed from\nAh-Ping's limbs, and he sank down upon the forbidding earth by Quen's\nside.\n\n\"'O most unfortunate one who is now speaking,' he exclaimed, when at\nlength his guarding spirit deemed it prudent to restore his power of\nexpressing himself in words, 'happy indeed would have been your lot had\nyou been content to traffic in ginseng and other commodities of which\nyou have actual knowledge. O amiable Quen, this matter must be in some\nway arranged without causing you to deviate from the entrancing paths of\nyour habitual virtue. Could not the very reasonable Liao be induced to\nlook favourably upon the attractions of some low-priced maiden, in which\ncase this not really hard-stomached person would be willing to advance\nthe necessary amount, until such time as it could be restored, at a very\nlow and unremunerative rate of interest?'\n\n\"'This person has observed every variety of practical humility in the\ncourse of his life,' replied Quen with commendable dignity, 'yet he now\nfinds himself totally unable to overcome an inward repugnance to the\nthought of perpetuating his honoured name and race through the medium of\nany low-priced maiden. To this end has he decided.'\n\n\"Those who were well acquainted with Ah-Ping in matters of commerce did\nnot hesitate to declare that his great wealth had been acquired by his\nconsistent habit of forming an opinion quickly while others hesitated.\nOn the occasion in question he only engaged his mind with the opposing\ncircumstances for a few moments before he definitely fixed upon the\ncourse which he should pursue.\n\n\"'Quen-Ki-Tong,' he said, with an evident intermingling of many very\nconflicting emotions, 'retain to the end this well-merited reputation\nfor unaffected honourableness which you have so fittingly earned. Few\nin the entire Empire, with powers so versatilely pointing to an eminent\nposition in any chosen direction, would have been content to pass their\nlives in an unremunerative existence devoted to actions of charity. Had\nyou selected an entirely different manner of living, this person has\nevery confidence that he, and many others in Lu-kwo, would by this time\nbe experiencing a very ignoble poverty. For this reason he will make\nit his most prominent ambition to hasten the realization of the amiable\nhopes expressed both by Liao and by Ts'ain, concerning their\nfuture relationship. In this, indeed, he himself will be more than\nexceptionally fortunate should the former one prove to possess even a\nportion of the clear-sighted sagaciousness exhibited by his engaging\nfather.'\n\n           \"VERSES COMPOSED BY A MUSICIAN OF LU-KWO, ON THE\n                 OCCASION OF THE WEDDING CEREMONY OF\n                           LIAO AND TS'AIN\n\n  \"Bright hued is the morning, the dark clouds have fallen;\n  At the mere waving of Quen's virtuous hands they melted away.\n  Happy is Liao in the possession of so accomplished a parent,\n  Happy also is Quen to have so discriminating a son.\n\n  \"The two persons in question sit, side by side, upon an\n      embroidered couch,\n  Listening to the well-expressed compliments of those who pass to\n      and fro.\n  From time to time their eyes meet, and glances of a very\n      significant amusement pass between them;\n  Can it be that on so ceremonious an occasion they are recalling\n      events of a gravity-removing nature?\n\n  \"The gentle and rainbow-like Ts'ain has already arrived,\n  With the graceful motion of a silver carp gliding through a screen\n      of rushes, she moves among those who are assembled.\n  On the brow of her somewhat contentious father there rests the\n      shadow of an ill-repressed sorrow;\n  Doubtless the frequently-misjudged Ah-Ping is thinking of his\n      lonely hearth, now that he is for ever parted from that which\n      he holds most precious.\n\n  \"In the most commodious chamber of the house the elegant\n      wedding-gifts are conspicuously displayed; let us stand beside\n      the one which we have contributed, and point out its\n      excellence to those who pass by.\n  Surely the time cannot be far distant when the sound of many gongs\n      will announce that the very desirable repast is at length to\n      be partaken of.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE VISION OF YIN, THE SON OF YAT HUANG\n\nWhen Yin, the son of Yat Huang, had passed beyond the years assigned\nto the pursuit of boyhood, he was placed in the care of the hunchback\nQuang, so that he might be fully instructed in the management of the\nvarious weapons used in warfare, and also in the art of stratagem, by\nwhich a skilful leader is often enabled to conquer when opposed to an\notherwise overwhelming multitude. In all these accomplishments Quang\nexcelled to an exceptional degree; for although unprepossessing in\nappearance he united matchless strength to an untiring subtlety. No\nother person in the entire Province of Kiang-si could hurl a javelin so\nunerringly while uttering sounds of terrifying menace, or could cause\nhis sword to revolve around him so rapidly, while his face looked\nout from the glittering circles with an expression of ill-intentioned\nmalignity that never failed to inspire his adversary with irrepressible\nemotions of alarm. No other person could so successfully feign to\nbe devoid of life for almost any length of time, or by his manner of\nbehaving create the fixed impression that he was one of insufficient\nunderstanding, and therefore harmless. It was for these reasons that\nQuang was chosen as the instructor of Yin by Yat Huang, who, without\npossessing any official degree, was a person to whom marks of obeisance\nwere paid not only within his own town, but for a distance of many li\naround it.\n\nAt length the time arrived when Yin would in the ordinary course of\nevents pass from the instructorship of Quang in order to devote himself\nto the commerce in which his father was engaged, and from time to time\nthe unavoidable thought arose persistently within his mind that although\nYat Huang doubtless knew better than he did what the circumstances of\nthe future required, yet his manner of life for the past years was not\nsuch that he could contemplate engaging in the occupation of buying and\nselling porcelain clay with feelings of an overwhelming interest. Quang,\nhowever, maintained with every manifestation of inspired assurance that\nYat Huang was to be commended down to the smallest detail, inasmuch\nas proficiency in the use of both blunt and sharp-edged weapons, and a\nfaculty for passing undetected through the midst of an encamped body\nof foemen, fitted a person for the every-day affairs of life above all\nother accomplishments.\n\n\"Without doubt the very accomplished Yat Huan is well advised on this\npoint,\" continued Quang, \"for even this mentally short-sighted person\ncan call up within his understanding numerous specific incidents in the\nordinary career of one engaged in the commerce of porcelain clay when\nsuch attainments would be of great remunerative benefit. Does the\nwell-endowed Yin think, for example, that even the most depraved person\nwould endeavour to gain an advantage over him in the matter of buying or\nselling porcelain clay if he fully understood the fact that the one with\nwhom he was trafficking could unhesitatingly transfix four persons with\none arrow at the distance of a hundred paces? Or to what advantage would\nit be that a body of unscrupulous outcasts who owned a field of inferior\nclay should surround it with drawn swords by day and night, endeavouring\nmeanwhile to dispose of it as material of the finest quality, if the one\nwhom they endeavoured to ensnare in this manner possessed the power of\nbeing able to pass through their ranks unseen and examine the clay at\nhis leisure?\"\n\n\"In the cases to which reference has been made, the possession of those\nqualities would undoubtedly be of considerable use,\" admitted Yin; yet,\nin spite of his entire ignorance of commercial matters, this one has a\nconfident feeling that it would be more profitable to avoid such very\ndoubtful forms of barter altogether rather than spend eight years\nin acquiring the arts by which to defeat them. \"That, however, is a\nquestion which concerns this person's virtuous and engaging father more\nthan his unworthy self, and his only regret is that no opportunity has\noffered by which he might prove that he has applied himself diligently\nto your instruction and example, O amiable Quang.\"\n\nIt had long been a regret to Quang also that no incident of a disturbing\nnature had arisen whereby Yin could have shown himself proficient in the\nmethods of defence and attack which he had taught him. This deficiency\nhe had endeavoured to overcome, as far as possible, by constructing\nlife-like models of all the most powerful and ferocious types of\nwarriors and the fiercest and most relentless animals of the forest,\nso that Yin might become familiar with their appearance and discover in\nwhat manner each could be the most expeditiously engaged.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" remarked Quang, on an occasion when Yin appeared to be\ncovered with honourable pride at having approached an unusually large\nand repulsive-looking tiger so stealthily that had the animal been\nreally alive it would certainly have failed to perceive him, \"such\naccomplishments are by no means to be regarded as conclusive in\nthemselves. To steal insidiously upon a destructively-included wild\nbeast and transfix it with one well-directed blow of a spear is attended\nby difficulties and emotions which are entirely absent in the case of a\nwickerwork animal covered with canvas-cloth, no matter how deceptive in\nappearance the latter may be.\"\n\nTo afford Yin a more trustworthy example of how he should engage with\nan adversary of formidable proportions, Quang resolved upon an ingenious\nplan. Procuring the skin of a grey wolf, he concealed himself within it,\nand in the early morning, while the mist-damp was still upon the ground,\nhe set forth to meet Yin, who had on a previous occasion spoken to\nhim of his intention to be at a certain spot at such an hour. In this\nconscientious enterprise, the painstaking Quang would doubtless have\nbeen successful, and Yin gained an assured proficiency and experience,\nhad it not chanced that on the journey Quang encountered a labourer of\nlow caste who was crossing the enclosed ground on his way to the rice\nfield in which he worked. This contemptible and inopportune person,\nnot having at any period of his existence perfected himself in the\nrecognized and elegant methods of attack and defence, did not act in\nthe manner which would assuredly have been adopted by Yin in similar\ncircumstances, and for which Quang would have been fully prepared. On\nthe contrary, without the least indication of what his intention was,\nhe suddenly struck Quang, who was hesitating for a moment what action to\ntake, a most intolerable blow with a formidable staff which he carried.\nThe stroke in question inflicted itself upon Quang upon that part of the\nbody where the head becomes connected with the neck, and would certainly\nhave been followed by others of equal force and precision had not Quang\nin the meantime decided that the most dignified course for him to adopt\nwould be to disclose his name and titles without delay. Upon learning\nthese facts, the one who stood before him became very grossly and\noffensively amused, and having taken from Quang everything of value\nwhich he carried among his garments, went on his way, leaving Yin's\ninstructor to retrace his steps in unendurable dejection, as he then\nfound that he possessed no further interest whatever in the undertaking.\n\nWhen Yat Huang was satisfied that his son was sufficiently skilled in\nthe various arts of warfare, he called him to his inner chamber, and\nhaving barred the door securely, he placed Yin under a very binding oath\nnot to reveal, until an appointed period, the matter which he was going\nto put before him.\n\n\"From father to son, in unbroken line for ten generations, has such a\ncustom been observed,\" he said, \"for the course of events is not to be\nlightly entered upon. At the commencement of that cycle, which period is\nnow fully fifteen score years ago, a very wise person chanced to incur\nthe displeasure of the Emperor of that time, and being in consequence\ndriven out of the capital, he fled to the mountains. There his subtle\ndiscernment and the pure and solitary existence which he led resulted in\nhis becoming endowed with faculties beyond those possessed by ordinary\nbeings. When he felt the end of his earthly career to be at hand he\ndescended into the plain, where, in a state of great destitution and\nbodily anguish, he was discovered by the one whom this person has\nreferred to as the first of the line of ancestors. In return for the\ncare and hospitality with which he was unhesitatingly received,\nthe admittedly inspired hermit spent the remainder of his days in\ndetermining the destinies of his rescuer's family and posterity. It\nis an undoubted fact that he predicted how one would, by well-directed\nenterprise and adventure, rise to a position of such eminence in the\nland that he counselled the details to be kept secret, lest the envy\nand hostility of the ambitious and unworthy should be raised. From this\ncause it has been customary to reveal the matter fully from father\nto son, at stated periods, and the setting out of the particulars in\nwritten words has been severely discouraged. Wise as this precaution\ncertainly was, it has resulted in a very inconvenient state of things;\nfor a remote ancestor--the fifth in line from the beginning--experienced\nsuch vicissitudes that he returned from his travels in a state of most\nabandoned idiocy, and when the time arrived that he should, in turn,\ncommunicate to his son, he was only able to repeat over and over again\nthe name of the pious hermit to whom the family was so greatly indebted,\ncoupling it each time with a new and markedly offensive epithet. The\nessential details of the undertaking having in this manner passed beyond\nrecall, succeeding generations, which were merely acquainted with the\nfact that a very prosperous future awaited the one who fulfilled the\nconditions, have in vain attempted to conform to them. It is not an\nalluring undertaking, inasmuch as nothing of the method to be pursued\ncan be learned, except that it was the custom of the early ones, who\nheld the full knowledge, to set out from home and return after a period\nof years. Yet so clearly expressed was the prophecy, and so great the\nreward of the successful, that all have eagerly journeyed forth when\nthe time came, knowing nothing beyond that which this person has now\nunfolded to you.\"\n\nWhen Yat Huang reached the end of the matter which it was his duty to\ndisclose, Yin for some time pondered the circumstances before replying.\nIn spite of a most engaging reverence for everything of a sacred nature,\nhe could not consider the inspired remark of the well-intentioned hermit\nwithout feelings of a most persistent doubt, for it occurred to him that\nif the person in question had really been as wise as he was represented\nto be, he might reasonably have been expected to avoid the unaccountable\nerror of offending the enlightened and powerful Emperor under whom he\nlived. Nevertheless, the prospect of engaging in the trade of porcelain\nclay was less attractive in his eyes than that of setting forth upon a\njourney of adventure, so that at length he expressed his willingness to\nact after the manner of those who had gone before him.\n\nThis decision was received by Yat Huang with an equal intermingling of\nthe feelings of delight and concern, for although he would have by no\nmeans pleasurably contemplated Yin breaking through a venerable and\nesteemed custom, he was unable to put entirely from him the thought of\nthe degrading fate which had overtaken the fifth in line who made the\nventure. It was, indeed, to guard Yin as much as possible against\nthe dangers to which he would become exposed, if he determined on the\nexpedition, that the entire course of his training had been selected. In\norder that no precaution of a propitious nature should be neglected, Yat\nHuang at once despatched written words of welcome to all with whom he\nwas acquainted, bidding them partake of a great banquet which he was\npreparing to mark the occasion of his son's leave-taking. Every variety\nof sacrifice was offered up to the controlling deities, both good and\nbad; the ten ancestors were continuously exhorted to take Yin under\ntheir special protection, and sets of verses recording his virtues and\nambitions were freely distributed among the necessitous and low-caste\nwho could not be received at the feast.\n\nThe dinner itself exceeded in magnificence any similar event that\nhad ever taken place in Ching-toi. So great was the polished ceremony\nobserved on the occasion, that each guest had half a score of cups of\nthe finest apricot-tea successively placed before him and taken away\nuntasted, while Yat Huang went to each in turn protesting vehemently\nthat the honour of covering such pure-minded and distinguished persons\nwas more than his badly designed roof could reasonably bear, and\nwittingly giving an entrancing air of reality to the spoken compliment\nby begging them to move somewhat to one side so that they might escape\nthe heavy central beam if the event which he alluded to chanced to take\nplace. After several hours had been spent in this congenial occupation,\nYat Huang proceeded to read aloud several of the sixteen discourses on\neducation which, taken together, form the discriminating and infallible\nexample of conduct known as the Holy Edict. As each detail was dwelt\nupon Yin arose from his couch and gave his deliberate testimony that\nall the required tests and rites had been observed in his own case.\nThe first part of the repast was then partaken of, the nature of the\ningredients and the manner of preparing them being fully explained,\nand in a like manner through each succeeding one of the four-and-forty\ncourses. At the conclusion Yin again arose, being encouraged by the\nrepeated uttering of his name by those present, and with extreme modesty\nand brilliance set forth his manner of thinking concerning all subjects\nwith which he was acquainted.\n\nEarly on the morning of the following day Yin set out on his travels,\nentirely unaccompanied, and carrying with him nothing beyond a sum of\nmoney, a silk robe, and a well-tried and reliable spear. For many days\nhe journeyed in a northerly direction, without encountering anything\nsufficiently unusual to engage his attention. This, however, was\ndoubtless part of a pre-arranged scheme so that he should not be drawn\nfrom a destined path, for at a small village lying on the southern shore\nof a large lake, called by those around Silent Water, he heard of the\nexistence of a certain sacred island, distant a full day's sailing,\nwhich was barren of all forms of living things, and contained only a\nsingle gigantic rock of divine origin and majestic appearance. Many\npersons, the villagers asserted, had sailed to the island in the hope\nof learning the portent of the rock, but none ever returned, and they\nthemselves avoided coming even within sight of it; for the sacred stone,\nthey declared, exercised an evil influence over their ships, and would,\nif permitted, draw them out of their course and towards itself. For this\nreason Yin could find no guide, whatever reward he offered, who would\naccompany him; but having with difficulty succeeded in hiring a small\nboat of inconsiderable value, he embarked with food, incense, and\nmaterials for building fires, and after rowing consistently for nearly\nthe whole of the day, came within sight of the island at evening.\nThereafter the necessity of further exertion ceased, for, as they of the\nvillage had declared would be the case, the vessel moved gently forward,\nin an unswerving line, without being in any way propelled, and reaching\nits destination in a marvellously short space of time, passed behind a\nprotecting spur of land and came to rest. It then being night, Yin did\nno more than carry his stores to a place of safety, and after lighting\na sacrificial fire and prostrating himself before the rock, passed into\nthe Middle Air.\n\nIn the morning Yin's spirit came back to the earth amid the sound of\nmusic of a celestial origin, which ceased immediately he recovered full\nconsciousness. Accepting this manifestation as an omen of Divine favour,\nYin journeyed towards the centre of the island where the rock stood,\nat every step passing the bones of innumerable ones who had come on a\nsimilar quest to his, and perished. Many of these had left behind them\ninscriptions on wood or bone testifying their deliberate opinion of the\nsacred rock, the island, their protecting deities, and the entire train\nof circumstances, which had resulted in their being in such a condition.\nThese were for the most part of a maledictory and unencouraging nature,\nso that after reading a few, Yin endeavoured to pass without being in\nany degree influenced by such ill-judged outbursts.\n\n\"Accursed be the ancestors of this tormented one to four generations\nback!\" was prominently traced upon an unusually large shoulder-blade.\n\"May they at this moment be simmering in a vat of unrefined dragon's\nblood, as a reward for having so undiscriminatingly reared the person\nwho inscribes these words only to attain this end!\" \"Be warned, O later\none, by the signs around!\" Another and more practical-minded person had\nwritten: \"Retreat with all haste to your vessel, and escape while\nthere is yet time. Should you, by chance, again reach land through this\nwarning, do not neglect, out of an emotion of gratitude, to burn an\nappropriate amount of sacrifice paper for the lessening of the torments\nof the spirit of Li-Kao,\" to which an unscrupulous one, who was plainly\ndesirous of sharing in the benefit of the requested sacrifice, without\nsuffering the exertion of inscribing a warning after the amiable manner\nof Li-Kao, had added the words, \"and that of Huan Sin.\"\n\nHalting at a convenient distance from one side of the rock which,\nwithout being carved by any person's hand, naturally resembled the\nsymmetrical countenance of a recumbent dragon (which he therefore\nconjectured to be the chief point of the entire mass), Yin built\nhis fire and began an unremitting course of sacrifice and respectful\nceremony. This manner of conduct he observed conscientiously for\nthe space of seven days. Towards the end of that period a feeling of\nunendurable dejection began to possess him, for his stores of all kinds\nwere beginning to fail, and he could not entirely put behind him the\nmemory of the various well-intentioned warnings which he had received,\nor the sight of the fleshless ones who had lined his path. On the eighth\nday, being weak with hunger and, by reason of an intolerable thirst,\nunable to restrain his body any longer in the spot where he had hitherto\ncontinuously prostrated himself nine-and-ninety times each hour without\nceasing, he rose to his feet and retraced his steps to the boat in order\nthat he might fill his water-skins and procure a further supply of food.\n\nWith a complicated emotion, in which was present every abandoned and\ndisagreeable thought to which a person becomes a prey in moments of\nexceptional mental and bodily anguish, he perceived as soon as\nhe reached the edge of the water that the boat, upon which he was\nconfidently relying to carry him back when all else failed, had\ndisappeared as entirely as the smoke from an extinguished opium pipe.\nAt this sight Yin clearly understood the meaning of Li-Kao's unregarded\nwarning, and recognized that nothing could now save him from adding his\nincorruptible parts to those of the unfortunate ones whose unhappy\nfate had, seven days ago, engaged his refined pity. Unaccountably\nstrengthened in body by the indignation which possessed him, and\ninspired with a virtuous repulsion at the treacherous manner of behaving\non the part of those who guided his destinies, he hastened back to\nhis place of obeisance, and perceiving that the habitually placid and\nintrospective expression on the dragon face had imperceptibly changed\ninto one of offensive cunning and unconcealed contempt, he snatched up\nhis spear and, without the consideration of a moment, hurled it at\na score of paces distance full into the sacred but nevertheless very\nunprepossessing face before him.\n\nAt the instant when the presumptuous weapon touched the holy stone the\nentire intervening space between the earth and the sky was filled with\ninnumerable flashes of forked and many-tongued lightning, so that the\nisland had the appearance of being the scene of a very extensive but\nsomewhat badly-arranged display of costly fireworks. At the same\ntime the thunder rolled among the clouds and beneath the sea in an\nexceedingly disconcerting manner. At the first indication of these\ncelestial movements a sudden blindness came upon Yin, and all power of\nthought or movement forsook him; nevertheless, he experienced an emotion\nof flight through the air, as though borne upwards upon the back of a\nwinged creature. When this emotion ceased, the blindness went from him\nas suddenly and entirely as if a cloth had been pulled away from his\neyes, and he perceived that he was held in the midst of a boundless\nspace, with no other object in view than the sacred rock, which had\nopened, as it were, revealing a mighty throng within, at the sight of\nwhom Yin's internal organs trembled as they would never have moved at\nordinary danger, for it was put into his spirit that these in whose\npresence he stood were the sacred Emperors of his country from the\nearliest time until the usurpation of the Chinese throne by the\ndevouring Tartar hordes from the North.\n\nAs Yin gazed in fear-stricken amazement, a knowledge of the various Pure\nOnes who composed the assembly came upon him. He understood that the\nthree unclad and commanding figures which stood together were the\nEmperors of the Heaven, Earth, and Man, whose reigns covered a space of\nmore than eighty thousand years, commencing from the time when the world\nbegan its span of existence. Next to them stood one wearing a robe of\nleopard-skin, his hand resting upon a staff of a massive club, while on\nhis face the expression of tranquillity which marked his predecessors\nhad changed into one of alert wakefulness; it was the Emperor of Houses,\nwhose reign marked the opening of the never-ending strife between man\nand all other creatures. By his side stood his successor, the Emperor of\nFire, holding in his right hand the emblem of the knotted cord, by which\nhe taught man to cultivate his mental faculties, while from his mouth\nissued smoke and flame, signifying that by the introduction of fire he\nhad raised his subjects to a state of civilized life.\n\nOn the other side of the boundless chamber which seemed to be contained\nwithin the rocks were Fou-Hy, Tchang-Ki, Tcheng-Nung, and Huang,\nstanding or reclining together. The first of these framed the calendar,\norganized property, thought out the eight Essential Diagrams, encouraged\nthe various branches of hunting, and the rearing of domestic animals,\nand instituted marriage. From his couch floated melodious sounds\nin remembrance of his discovery of the property of stringed woods.\nTchang-Ki, who manifested the property of herbs and growing plants, wore\na robe signifying his attainments by means of embroidered symbols.\nHis hand rested on the head of the dragon, while at his feet flowed a\nbottomless canal of the purest water. The discovery of written letters\nby Tcheng-Nung, and his ingenious plan of grouping them after the manner\nof the constellations of stars, was emblemized in a similar manner,\nwhile Huang, or the Yellow Emperor, was surrounded by ores of the\nuseful and precious metals, weapons of warfare, written books, silks\nand articles of attire, coined money, and a variety of objects, all\ntestifying to his ingenuity and inspired energy.\n\nThese illustrious ones, being the greatest, were the first to take\nYin's attention, but beyond them he beheld an innumerable concourse of\nEmperors who not infrequently outshone their majestic predecessors in\nthe richness of their apparel and the magnificence of the jewels which\nthey wore. There Yin perceived Hung-Hoang, who first caused the chants\nto be collected, and other rulers of the Tcheon dynasty; Yong-Tching,\nwho compiled the Holy Edict; Thang rulers whose line is rightly called\n\"the golden,\" from the unsurpassed excellence of the composed verses\nwhich it produced; renowned Emperors of the versatile Han dynasty; and,\nstanding apart, and shunned by all, the malignant and narrow-minded\nTsing-Su-Hoang, who caused the Sacred Books to be burned.\n\nEven while Yin looked and wondered, in great fear, a rolling voice,\ncoming from one who sat in the midst of all, holding in his right hand\nthe sun, and in his left the moon, sounded forth, like the music of many\nbrass instruments playing in unison. It was the First Man who spoke.\n\n\"Yin, son of Yat Huang, and creature of the Lower Part,\" he said,\n\"listen well to the words I speak, for brief is the span of your\ntarrying in the Upper Air, nor will the utterance I now give forth ever\ncome unto your ears again, either on the earth, or when, blindly groping\nin the Middle Distance, your spirit takes its nightly flight. They who\nare gathered around, and whose voices I speak, bid me say this: Although\nimmeasurably above you in all matters, both of knowledge and of power,\nyet we greet you as one who is well-intentioned, and inspired with\nhonourable ambition. Had you been content to entreat and despair, as did\nall the feeble and incapable ones whose white bones formed your pathway,\nyour ultimate fate would have in no wise differed from theirs. But\ninasmuch as you held yourself valiantly, and, being taken, raised an\ninstinctive hand in return, you have been chosen; for the day to mute\nsubmission has, for the time or for ever, passed away, and the hour is\nwhen China shall be saved, not by supplication, but by the spear.\"\n\n\"A state of things which would have been highly unnecessary if I had\nbeen permitted to carry out my intention fully, and restore man to his\nprehistoric simplicity,\" interrupted Tsin-Su-Hoang. \"For that reason,\nwhen the voice of the assemblage expresses itself, it must be understood\nthat it represents in no measure the views of Tsin-Su-Hoang.\"\n\n\"In the matter of what has gone before, and that which will follow\nhereafter,\" continued the Voice dispassionately, \"Yin, the son\nof Yat-Huang, must concede that it is in no part the utterance of\nTsin-Su-Hoang--Tsin-Su-Hoang who burned the Sacred Books.\"\n\nAt the mention of the name and offence of this degraded being a great\nsound went up from the entire multitude--a universal cry of execration,\nnot greatly dissimilar from that which may be frequently heard in the\ncrowded Temple of Impartiality when the one whose duty it is to take up,\nat a venture, the folded papers, announces that the sublime Emperor,\nor some mandarin of exalted rank, has been so fortunate as to hold\nthe winning number in the Annual State Lottery. So vengeance-laden and\nmournful was the combined and evidently preconcerted wail, that Yin\nwas compelled to shield his ears against it; yet the inconsiderable\nTsin-Su-Hoang, on whose account it was raised, seemed in no degree to\nbe affected by it, he, doubtless, having become hardened by hearing\na similar outburst, at fixed hours, throughout interminable cycles of\ntime.\n\nWhen the last echo of the cry had passed away the Voice continued to\nspeak.\n\n\"Soon the earth will again receive you, Yin,\" it said, \"for it is not\nrespectful that a lower one should be long permitted to gaze upon our\nexalted faces. Yet when you go forth and stand once more among men this\nis laid on you: that henceforth you are as a being devoted to a fixed\nand unchanging end, and whatever moves towards the restoring of the\nthrone of the Central Empire the outcast but unalterably sacred line of\nits true sovereigns shall have your arm and mind. By what combination\nof force and stratagem this can be accomplished may not be honourably\nrevealed by us, the all-knowing. Nevertheless, omens and guidance shall\nnot be lacking from time to time, and from the beginning the weapon by\nwhich you have attained to this distinction shall be as a sign of our\nfavour and protection over you.\"\n\nWhen the Voice made an end of speaking the sudden blindness came upon\nYin, as it had done before, and from the sense of motion which he\nexperienced, he conjectured that he was being conveyed back to the\nisland. Undoubtedly this was the case, for presently there came upon him\nthe feeling that he was awakening from a deep and refreshing sleep,\nand opening his eyes, which he now found himself able to do without\nany difficulty, he immediately discovered that he was reclining at full\nlength on the ground, and at a distance of about a score of paces from\nthe dragon head. His first thought was to engage in a lengthy course\nof self-abasement before it, but remembering the words which had been\nspoken to him while in the Upper Air, he refrained, and even ventured to\ngo forward with a confident but somewhat self-deprecatory air, to\nregain the spear, which he perceived lying at the foot of the rock. With\nfeelings of a reassuring nature he then saw that the very undesirable\nexpression which he had last beheld upon the dragon face had melted into\none of encouraging urbanity and benignant esteem.\n\nClose by the place where he had landed he discovered his boat, newly\nfurnished with wine and food of a much more attractive profusion than\nthat which he had purchased in the village. Embarking in it, he made as\nthough he would have returned to the south, but the spear which he held\nturned within his grasp, and pointed in an exactly opposite direction.\nRegarding this fact as an express command on the part of the Deities,\nYin turned his boat to the north, and in the space of two days'\ntime--being continually guided by the fixed indication of the spear--he\nreached the shore and prepared to continue his travels in the same\ndirection, upheld and inspired by the knowledge that henceforth he moved\nunder the direct influence of very powerful spirits.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE ILL-REGULATED DESTINY OF KIN YEN, THE PICTURE-MAKER\n\n  As recorded by himself before his sudden departure from Peking,\n  owing to circumstances which are made plain in the following\n  narrative.\n\nThere are moments in the life of a person when the saying of the wise\nNi-Hyu that \"Misfortune comes to all men and to most women\" is endowed\nwith double force. At such times the faithful child of the Sun is a prey\nto the whitest and most funereal thoughts, and even the inspired\nwisdom of his illustrious ancestors seems more than doubtful, while the\ncontinued inactivity of the Sacred Dragon appears for the time to give\ncolour to the scoffs of the Western barbarian. A little while ago these\nmisgivings would have found no resting-place in the bosom of the writer.\nNow, however--but the matter must be made clear from the beginning.\n\nThe name of the despicable person who here sets forth his immature story\nis Kin Yen, and he is a native of Kia-Lu in the Province of Che-Kiang.\nHaving purchased from a very aged man the position of Hereditary\nInstructor in the Art of Drawing Birds and Flowers, he gave lessons in\nthese accomplishments until he had saved sufficient money to journey\nto Peking. Here it was his presumptuous intention to learn the art of\ndrawing figures in order that he might illustrate printed leaves of\na more distinguished class than those which would accept what true\npoliteness compels him to call his exceedingly unsymmetrical pictures\nof birds and flowers. Accordingly, when the time arrived, he disposed of\nhis Hereditary Instructorship, having first ascertained in the interests\nof his pupils that his successor was a person of refined morals and\ngreat filial piety.\n\nAlas! it is well written, \"The road to eminence lies through the cheap\nand exceedingly uninviting eating-houses.\" In spite of this person's\ngreat economy, and of his having begged his way from Kia-Lu to Peking in\nthe guise of a pilgrim, journeying to burn incense in the sacred Temple\nof Truth near that city, when once within the latter place his taels\nmelted away like the smile of a person of low class when he discovers\nthat the mandarin's stern words were not intended as a jest. Moreover,\nhe found that the story-makers of Peking, receiving higher rewards\nthan those at Kia-Lu, considered themselves bound to introduce living\ncharacters into all their tales, and in consequence the very ornamental\ndrawings of birds and flowers which he had entwined into a legend\nentitled \"The Last Fight of the Heaven-sent Tcheng\"--a story which\nhad been entrusted to him for illustration as a test of his skill--was\nreturned to him with a communication in which the writer revealed his\nreal meaning by stating contrary facts. It therefore became necessary\nthat he should become competent in the art of drawing figures without\ndelay, and with this object he called at the picture-room of Tieng Lin,\na person whose experience was so great that he could, without discomfort\nto himself, draw men and women of all classes, both good and bad. When\nthe person who is setting forth this narrative revealed to Tieng Lin the\nutmost amount of money he could afford to give for instruction in the\nart of drawing living figures, Tieng Lin's face became as overcast as\nthe sky immediately before the Great Rains, for in his ignorance of\nthis incapable person's poverty he had treated him with equality and\ncourtesy, nor had he kept him waiting in the mean room on the plea that\nhe was at that moment closeted with the Sacred Emperor. However, upon\nreceiving an assurance that a rumour would be spread in which the number\nof taels should be multiplied by ten, and that the sum itself should be\nbrought in advance, Tieng Lin promised to instruct this person in the\nart of drawing five characters, which, he said, would be sufficient\nto illustrate all stories except those by the most expensive and\nhighly-rewarded story-tellers--men who have become so proficient that\nthey not infrequently introduce a score or more of living persons into\ntheir tales without confusion.\n\nAfter considerable deliberation, this unassuming person selected the\nfollowing characters, judging them to be the most useful, and the most\nreadily applicable to all phases and situations of life:\n\n1. A bad person, wearing a long dark pigtail and smoking an opium pipe.\nHis arms to be folded, and his clothes new and very expensive.\n\n2. A woman of low class. One who removes dust and useless things from\nthe rooms of the over-fastidious and of those who have long nails; she\nto be carrying her trade-signs.\n\n3. A person from Pe-ling, endowed with qualities which cause the\nbeholder to be amused. This character to be especially designed to go\nwith the short sayings which remove gravity.\n\n4. One who, having incurred the displeasure of the sublime Emperor, has\nbeen decapitated in consequence.\n\n5. An ordinary person of no striking or distinguished appearance. One\nwho can be safely introduced in all places and circumstances without\ngreat fear of detection.\n\nAfter many months spent in constant practice and in taking measurements,\nthis unenviable person attained a very high degree of proficiency, and\ncould draw any of the five characters without hesitation. With renewed\nhope, therefore, he again approached those who sit in easy-chairs, and\nconcealing his identity (for they are stiff at bending, and when once\na picture-maker is classed as \"of no good\" he remains so to the end, in\nspite of change), he succeeded in getting entrusted with a story by\nthe elegant and refined Kyen Tal. This writer, as he remembered with\ndistrust, confines his distinguished efforts entirely to the doings of\nsailors and of those connected with the sea, and this tale, indeed, he\nfound upon reading to be the narrative of how a Hang-Chow junk and its\ncrew, consisting mostly of aged persons, were beguiled out of their\ncourse by an exceedingly ill-disposed dragon, and wrecked upon an island\nof naked barbarians. It was, therefore, with a somewhat heavy stomach\nthat this person set himself the task of arranging his five characters\nas so to illustrate the words of the story.\n\nThe sayings of the ancient philosopher Tai Loo are indeed very subtle,\nand the truth of his remark, \"After being disturbed in one's dignity by\na mandarin's foot it is no unusual occurrence to fall flat on the\nface in crossing a muddy street,\" was now apparent. Great as was the\ndisadvantage owing to the nature of the five characters, this became as\nnothing when it presently appeared that the avaricious and clay-souled\nTieng Lin, taking advantage of the blindness of this person's\nenthusiasm, had taught him the figures so that they all gazed in the\nsame direction. In consequence of this it would have been impossible\nthat two should be placed as in the act of conversing together had not\nthe noble Kyen Tal been inspired to write that \"his companions turned\nfrom him in horror.\" This incident the ingenious person who is recording\nthese facts made the subject of three separate drawings, and having\nin one or two other places effected skilful changes in the writing, so\nsimilar in style to the strokes of the illustrious Kyen Tal as to\nbe undetectable, he found little difficulty in making use of all his\ncharacters. The risks of the future, however, were too great to be run\nwith impunity; therefore it was arranged, by means of money--for this\nperson was fast becoming acquainted with the ways of Peking--that an\nemissary from one who sat in an easy-chair should call upon him for a\nconference, the narrative of which appeared in this form in the Peking\nPrinted Leaves of Thrice-distilled Truth:\n\n  The brilliant and amiable young picture-maker Kin Yen, in spite of\n  the immediate and universal success of his accomplished efforts,\n  is still quite rotund in intellect, nor is he, if we may use a\n  form of speaking affected by our friends across the Hoang Hai,\n  \"suffering from swollen feet.\" A person with no recognized\n  position, but one who occasionally does inferior work of this\n  nature for us, recently surprised Kin Yen without warning, and\n  found him in his sumptuously appointed picture-room, busy with\n  compasses and tracing-paper. About the place were scattered in\n  elegant confusion several of his recent masterpieces. From the\n  subsequent conversation we are in a position to make it known that\n  in future this refined and versatile person will confine himself\n  entirely to illustrations of processions, funerals, armies on the\n  march, persons pursued by others, and kindred subjects which\n  appeal strongly to his imagination. Kin Yen has severe emotions on\n  the subject of individuality in art, and does not hesitate to\n  express himself forcibly with reference to those who are content\n  to degrade the names of their ancestors by turning out what he\n  wittily describes as \"so much of varied mediocrity.\"\n\nThe prominence obtained by this pleasantly-composed notice--for it was\ncopied by others who were unaware of the circumstance of its origin--had\nthe desired effect. In future, when one of those who sit in easy-chairs\nwished for a picture after the kind mentioned, he would say to his\nlesser one: \"Oh, send to the graceful and versatile Kin Yen; he becomes\ninspired on the subject of funerals,\" or persons escaping from prison,\nor families walking to the temple, or whatever it might be. In that way\nthis narrow-minded and illiterate person was soon both looked at and\nrich, so that it was his daily practice to be carried, in silk garments,\npast the houses of those who had known him in poverty, and on these\noccasions he would puff out his cheeks and pull his moustaches, looking\nfiercely from side to side.\n\nTrue are the words written in the elegant and distinguished Book of\nVerses: \"Beware lest when being kissed by the all-seeing Emperor, you\nstep upon the elusive banana-peel.\" It was at the height of eminence in\nthis altogether degraded person's career that he encountered the being\nwho led him on to his present altogether too lamentable condition.\n\nTien Nung is the earthly name by which is known she who combines all the\nmost illustrious attributes which have been possessed of women since the\ndays of the divine Fou-Hy. Her father is a person of very gross habits,\nand lives by selling inferior merchandise covered with some of good\nquality. Upon past occasions, when under the direct influence of Tien,\nand in the hope of gaining some money benefit, this person may have\nspoken of him in terms of praise, and may even have recommended friends\nto entrust articles of value to him, or to procure goods on his advice.\nNow, however, he records it as his unalterable decision that the father\nof Tien Nung is by profession a person who obtains goods by stratagem,\nand that, moreover, it is impossible to gain an advantage over him on\nmatters of exchange.\n\nThe events that have happened prove the deep wisdom of Li Pen when\nhe exclaimed \"The whitest of pigeons, no matter how excellent in the\nsilk-hung chamber, is not to be followed on the field of battle.\" Tien\nherself was all that the most exacting of persons could demand, but\nher opinions on the subject of picture-making were not formed by heavy\nthought, and it would have been well if this had been borne in mind by\nthis person. One morning he chanced to meet her while carrying open in\nhis hands four sets of printed leaves containing his pictures.\n\n\"I have observed,\" said Tien, after the usual personal inquiries had\nbeen exchanged, \"that the renowned Kin Yen, who is the object of the\nkeenest envy among his brother picture-makers, so little regards the\nsacredness of his accomplished art that never by any chance does he\ndepict persons of the very highest excellence. Let not the words of an\nimpetuous maiden disarrange his digestive organs if they should seem\ntoo bold to the high-souled Kin Yen, but this matter has, since she has\nknown him, troubled the eyelids of Tien. Here,\" she continued, taking\nfrom this person's hand one of the printed leaves which he was carrying,\n\"in this illustration of persons returning from extinguishing a fire,\nis there one who appears to possess those qualities which appeal to\nall that is intellectual and competitive within one? Can it be that the\nimmaculate Kin Yen is unacquainted with the subtle distinction between\nthe really select and the vastly ordinary? Ah, undiscriminating Kin Yen!\nare not the eyelashes of the person who is addressing you as threads\nof fine gold to junk's cables when compared with those of the extremely\ncommonplace female who is here pictured in the art of carrying a bucket?\nCan the most refined lack of vanity hide from you the fact that your own\nperson is infinitely rounder than this of the evilly-intentioned-looking\nindividual with the opium pipe? O blind Kin Yen!\"\n\nHere she fled in honourable confusion, leaving this person standing in\nthe street, astounded, and a prey to the most distinguished emotions of\na complicated nature.\n\n\"Oh, Tien,\" he cried at length, \"inspired by those bright eyes, narrower\nthan the most select of the three thousand and one possessed by the\nsublime Buddha, the almost fallen Kin Yen will yet prove himself worthy\nof your esteemed consideration. He will, without delay, learn to draw\ntwo new living persons, and will incorporate in them the likenesses\nwhich you have suggested.\"\n\nReturning swiftly to his abode, he therefore inscribed and despatched\nthis letter, in proof of his resolve:\n\n\"To the Heaven-sent human chrysanthemum, in whose body reside the\nCelestial Principles and the imprisoned colours of the rainbow.\n\n\"From the very offensive and self-opinionated picture-maker.\n\n\"Henceforth this person will take no rest, nor eat any but the commonest\nfood, until he shall have carried out the wishes of his one Jade Star,\nshe whose teeth he is not worthy to blacken.\n\n\"When Kin Yen has been entrusted with a story which contains a being in\nsome degree reflecting the character of Tien, he will embellish it with\nher irreproachable profile and come to hear her words. Till then he bids\nher farewell.\"\n\nFrom that moment most of this person's time was necessarily spent in\nlearning to draw the two new characters, and in consequence of this he\nlost much work, and, indeed, the greater part of the connexion which\nhe had been at such pains to form gradually slipped away from him. Many\nmonths passed before he was competent to reproduce persons resembling\nTien and himself, for in this he was unassisted by Tieng Lin, and his\nprogress was slow.\n\nAt length, being satisfied, he called upon the least fierce of those\nwho sit in easy-chairs, and requested that he might be entrusted with a\nstory for picture-making.\n\n\"We should have been covered with honourable joy to set in operation\nthe brush of the inspired Kin Yen,\" replied the other with agreeable\ncondescension; \"only at the moment, it does not chance that we have\nbefore us any stories in which funerals, or beggars being driven from\nthe city, form the chief incidents. Perhaps if the polished Kin Yen\nshould happen to be passing this ill-constructed office in about six\nmonths' time--\"\n\n\"The brush of Kin Yen will never again depict funerals, or labourers\narranging themselves to receive pay or similar subjects,\" exclaimed this\nperson impetuously, \"for, as it is well said, 'The lightning discovers\nobjects which the paper-lantern fails to reveal.' In future none\nbut tales dealing with the most distinguished persons shall have his\nattention.\"\n\n\"If this be the true word of the dignified Kin Yen, it is possible that\nwe may be able to animate his inspired faculties,\" was the response.\n\"But in that case, as a new style must be in the nature of an\nexperiment, and as our public has come to regard Kin Yen as the\ngreat exponent of Art Facing in One Direction, we cannot continue the\nexceedingly liberal payment with which we have been accustomed to reward\nhis elegant exertions.\"\n\n\"Provided the story be suitable, that is a matter of less importance,\"\nreplied this person.\n\n\"The story,\" said the one in the easy-chair, \"is by the refined\nTong-king, and it treats of the high-minded and conscientious doubts\nof one who would become a priest of Fo. When preparing for this\ndistinguished office he discovers within himself leanings towards\nthe religion of Lao-Tse. His illustrious scruples are enhanced by his\naffection for Wu Ping, who now appears in the story.\"\n\n\"And the ending?\" inquired this person, for it was desirable that the\ntwo should marry happily.\n\n\"The inimitable stories of Tong-king never have any real ending, and\nthis one, being in his most elevated style, has even less end than\nmost of them. But the whole narrative is permeated with the odour of\njoss-sticks and honourable high-mindedness, and the two characters are\nboth of noble birth.\"\n\nAs it might be some time before another story so suitable should be\noffered, or one which would afford so good an opportunity of wafting\nincense to Tien, and of displaying her incomparable outline in dignified\nand magnanimous attitudes, this was eagerly accepted, and for the next\nweek this obscure person spent all his days and nights in picturing the\nlovely Tien and his debased self in the characters of the nobly-born\nyoung priest of Fo and Wu Ping. The pictures finished, he caused them to\nbe carefully conveyed to the office, and then, sitting down, spent\nmany hours in composing the following letter, to be sent to Tien,\naccompanying a copy of the printed leaves wherein the story and his\ndrawing should appear:\n\n\"When the light has for a period been hidden from a person, it is\nno uncommon thing for him to be struck blind on gazing at the sun;\ntherefore, if the sublime Tien values the eyes of Kin Yen, let her hide\nherself behind a gauze screen on his approach.\n\n\"The trembling words of Tien have sunk deep into the inside of Kin Yen\nand become part of his being. Never again can he depict persons of the\nquality and in the position he was wont to do.\n\n\"With this he sends his latest efforts. In each case he conceives his\ndrawings to be the pictures of the written words; in the noble Tien's\ncase it is undoubtedly so, in his own he aspires to it. Doubtless the\nunobtrusive Tien would make no claim to the character and manner of\nbehaving of the one in the story, yet Kin Yen confidently asserts that\nshe is to the other as the glove is to the hand, and he is filled with\nthe most intelligent delight at being able to exhibit her in her true\nrobes, by which she will be known to all who see her, in spite of her\ndignified protests. Kin Yen hopes; he will come this evening after\nsunset.\"\n\nThe week which passed between the finishing of the pictures and the\nappearance of the eminent printed leaves containing them was the longest\nin this near-sighted person's ill-spent life. But at length the day\narrived, and going with exceedingly mean haste to the place of sale, he\npurchased a copy and sent it, together with the letter of his honourable\nintention, on which he had bestowed so much care, to Tien.\n\nNot till then did it occur to this inconsiderable one that the\nimpetuousness of his action was ill-judged; for might it not be that the\npictures were evilly-printed, or that the delicate and fragrant words\npainting the character of the one who now bore the features of Tien had\nundergone some change?\n\nTo satisfy himself, scarce as taels had become with him, he purchased\nanother copy.\n\nThere are many exalted sayings of the wise and venerable Confucious\nconstructed so as to be of service and consolation in moments of strong\nmental distress. These for the greater part recommend tranquillity\nof mind, a complete abnegation of the human passions and the\nlike behaviour. The person who is here endeavouring to bring this\nbadly-constructed account of his dishonourable career to a close\npondered these for some moments after twice glancing through the matter\nin the printed leaves, and then, finding the faculties of speech and\nmovement restored to him, procured a two-edged knife of distinguished\nbrilliance and went forth to call upon the one who sits in an\neasy-chair.\n\n\"Behold,\" said the lesser one, insidiously stepping in between this\nperson an the inner door, \"my intellectual and all-knowing chief is not\nhere to-day. May his entirely insufficient substitute offer words of\ncongratulation to the inspired Kin Yen on his effective and striking\npictures in this week's issue?\"\n\n\"His altogether insufficient substitute,\" answered this person, with\ndifficulty mastering his great rage, \"may and shall offer words of\nexplanation to the inspired Kin Yen, setting forth the reason of his\npictures being used, not with the high-minded story of the elegant\nTong-king for which they were executed, but accompanying exceedingly\nbase, foolish, and ungrammatical words written by Klan-hi, the Peking\nremover of gravity--words which will evermore brand the dew-like Tien\nas a person of light speech and no refinement\"; and in his agony this\nperson struck the lacquered table several times with his elegant knife.\n\n\"O Kin Yen,\" exclaimed the lesser one, \"this matter rests not here. It\nis a thing beyond the sphere of the individual who is addressing you.\nAll he can tell is that the graceful Tong-king withdrew his exceedingly\ntedious story for some reason at the final moment, and as your eminent\ndrawings had been paid for, my chief of the inner office decided to use\nthem with this story of Klan-hi. But surely it cannot be that there is\naught in the story to displease your illustrious personality?\"\n\n\"Judge for yourself,\" this person said, \"first understanding that the\ntwo immaculate characters figuring as the personages of the narrative\nare exact copies of this dishonoured person himself and of the willowy\nTien, daughter of the vastly rich Pe-li-Chen, whom he was hopeful of\nmarrying.\"\n\nSelecting one of the least offensive of the passages in the work, this\nunhappy person read the following immature and inelegant words:\n\n\"This well-satisfied writer of printed leaves had a highly-distinguished\ntime last night. After Chow had departed to see about food, and the junk\nhad been fastened up at the lock of Kilung, on the Yang-tse-Kiang, he\nand the round-bodied Shang were journeying along the narrow path by the\nriver-side when the right leg of the graceful and popular person who\nis narrating these events disappeared into the river. Suffering no\napprehension in the dark, but that the vanishing limb was the left leg\nof Shang, this intelligent writer allowed his impassiveness to melt away\nto an exaggerated degree; but at that moment the circumstance became\nplain to the round-bodied Shang, who was in consequence very grossly\namused at the mishap and misapprehension of your good lord, the writer,\nat the same time pointing out the matter as it really was. Then it\nchanced that there came by one of the maidens who carry tea and jest for\nsmall sums of money to the sitters at the little tables with round white\ntops, at which this remarkable person, the confidant of many mandarins,\never desirous of displaying his priceless power of removing gravity,\nsaid to her:\n\n\"'How much of gladness, Ning-Ning? By the Sacred Serpent this is plainly\nyour night out.'\n\n\"Perceiving the true facts of the predicament of this commendable\nwriter, she replied:\n\n\"'Suffer not your illustrious pigtail to be removed, venerable Wang; for\nin this maiden's estimation it is indeed your night in.'\n\n\"There are times when this valued person wonders whether his method\nof removing gravity be in reality very antique or quite new. On such\noccasions the world, with all its schools, and those who interfere in\nthe concerns of others, continues to revolve around him. The wondrous\nsky-lanterns come out silently two by two like to the crystallized music\nof stringed woods. Then, in the mystery of no-noise, his head becomes\ngreatly enlarged with celestial and highly-profound thoughts; his\ngroping hand seems to touch matter which may be written out in his\nimpressive style and sold to those who print leaves, and he goes home to\nwrite out such.\"\n\nWhen this person looked up after reading, with tears of shame in his\neyes, he perceived that the lesser one had cautiously disappeared.\nTherefore, being unable to gain admittance to the inner office, he\nreturned to his home.\n\nHere the remark of the omniscient Tai Loo again fixes itself upon the\nattention. No sooner had this incapable person reached his house than he\nbecame aware that a parcel had arrived for him from the still adorable\nTien. Retiring to a distance from it, he opened the accompanying letter\nand read:\n\n\"When a virtuous maiden has been made the victim of a heartless jest or\na piece of coarse stupidity at a person's hands, it is no uncommon thing\nfor him to be struck blind on meeting her father. Therefore, if the\ndegraded and evil-minded Kin Yen values his eyes, ears, nose, pigtail,\neven his dishonourable breath, let him hide himself behind a fortified\nwall at Pe-li-Chen's approach.\n\n\"With this Tien returns everything she has ever accepted from Kin Yen.\nShe even includes the brace of puppies which she received anonymously\nabout a month ago, and which she did not eat, but kept for reasons of\nher own--reasons entirely unconnected with the vapid and exceedingly\nconceited Kin Yen.\"\n\nAs though this letter, and the puppies of which this person now heard\nfor the first time, making him aware of the existence of a rival lover,\nwere not enough, there almost immediately arrived a letter from Tien's\nfather:\n\n\"This person has taken the advice of those skilled in extorting money by\nmeans of law forms, and he finds that Kin Yen has been guilty of a grave\nand highly expensive act. This is increased by the fact that Tien had\nconveyed his seemingly distinguished intentions to all her friends,\nbefore whom she now stands in an exceedingly ungraceful attitude. The\nmachinery for depriving Kin Yen of all the necessaries of existence\nshall be put into operation at once.\"\n\nAt this point, the person who is now concluding his obscure and\ncommonplace history, having spent his last piece of money on joss-sticks\nand incense-paper, and being convinced of the presence of the spirits of\nhis ancestors, is inspired to make the following prophecies: That Tieng\nLin, who imposed upon him in the matter of picture-making, shall come\nto a sudden end, accompanied by great internal pains, after suffering\nextreme poverty; that the one who sits in an easy-chair, together with\nhis lesser one and all who make stories for them, shall, while sailing\nto a rice feast during the Festival of Flowers, be precipitated into the\nwater and slowly devoured by sea monsters, Klan-hi in particular being\ntortured in the process; that Pel-li-Chen, the father of Tien, shall\nbe seized with the dancing sickness when in the presence of the august\nEmperor, and being in consequence suspected of treachery, shall, to\nprove the truth of his denials, be submitted to the tests of boiling\ntar, red-hot swords, and of being dropped from a great height on to the\nSacred Stone of Goodness and Badness, in each of which he shall fail to\nconvince his judges or to establish his innocence, to the amusement of\nall beholders.\n\nThese are the true words of Kin Yen, the picture-maker, who, having\nunweighed his mind and exposed the avaricious villainy of certain\npersons, is now retiring by night to a very select and hidden spot in\nthe Khingan Mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Wallet of Kai Lung, by Ernest Bramah\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WALLET OF KAI LUNG ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1076.txt or 1076.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/7/1076/\n\nProduced by John Bickers\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
