For though they were king's sons, they\nhad but little world's wealth; save and except good meat and drink, and\nenough or too much thereof; house-room of the best; friends to be merry\nwith, and maidens to kiss, and these also as good as might be; freedom\nwithal to come and go as they would; the heavens above them, the earth\nto bear them up, and the meadows and acres, the woods and fair streams,\nand the little hills of Upmeads, for that was the name of their country\nand the kingdom of King Peter.\n\nSo having nought but this little they longed for much; and that the\nmore because, king's sons as they were, they had but scant dominion\nsave over their horses and dogs: for the men of that country were\nstubborn and sturdy vavassors, and might not away with masterful\ndoings, but were like to pay back a blow with a blow, and a foul word\nwith a buffet.  So that, all things considered, it was little wonder if\nKing Peter's sons found themselves straitened in their little land:\nwherein was no great merchant city; no mighty castle, or noble abbey of\nmonks:  nought but fair little halls of yeomen, with here and there a\nfranklin's court or a shield-knight's manor-house; with many a goodly\nchurch, and whiles a house of good canons, who knew not the road to\nRome, nor how to find the door of the Chancellor's house.\n\nSo these young men wearied their father and mother a long while with\ntelling them of their weariness, and their longing to be gone: till at\nlast on a fair and hot afternoon of June King Peter rose up from the\ncarpet which the Prior of St. John's by the Bridge had given him (for\nhe had been sleeping thereon amidst the grass of his orchard after his\ndinner) and he went into the hall of his house, which was called the\nHigh House of Upmeads, and sent for his four sons to come to him.  And\nthey came and stood before his high-seat and he said:\n\n\"Sons, ye have long wearied me with words concerning your longing for\ntravel on the roads; now if ye verily wish to be gone, tell me when\nwould ye take your departure if ye had your choice?\"\n\nThey looked at one another, and the three younger ones nodded at Blaise\nthe eldest:  so he began, and said:  \"Saving the love and honour that\nwe have for thee, and also for our mother, we would be gone at once,\neven with the noon's meat still in our bellies.  But thou art the lord\nin this land, and thou must rule.  Have I said well, brethren?\"  And\nthey all said \"Yea, yea.\" Then said the king; \"Good! now is the sun\nhigh and hot; yet if ye ride softly ye may come to some good harbour\nbefore nightfall without foundering your horses.  So come ye in an\nhour's space to the Four-want-way, and there and then will I order your\ndeparture.\"\n\nThe young men were full of joy when they heard his word; and they\ndeparted and went this way and that, gathering such small matters as\neach deemed that he needed, and which he might lightly carry with him;\nthen they armed themselves, and would bid the squires bring them their\nhorses; but men told them that the said squires had gone their ways\nalready to the Want-way by the king's commandment: so thither they went\nat once a-foot all four in company, laughing and talking together\nmerrily.\n\nIt must be told that this Want-way aforesaid was but four furlongs from\nthe House, which lay in an ingle of the river called Upmeads Water\namongst very fair meadows at the end of the upland tillage; and the\nland sloped gently up toward the hill-country and the unseen mountains\non the north; but to the south was a low ridge which ran along the\nwater, as it wound along from west to east.  Beyond the said ridge, at\na place whence you could see the higher hills to the south, that\nstretched mainly east and west also, there was presently an end of the\nKingdom of Upmeads, though the neighbours on that side were peaceable\nand friendly, and were wont to send gifts to King Peter.  But toward\nthe north beyond the Want-way King Peter was lord over a good stretch\nof land, and that of the best; yet was he never a rich man, for he had\nno freedom to tax and tail his folk, nor forsooth would he have used it\nif he had; for he was no ill man, but kindly and of measure.  On these\nnorthern marches there was war at whiles, whereas they ended in a great\nforest well furnished of trees; and this wood was debateable, and King\nPeter and his sons rode therein at their peril: but great plenty was\ntherein of all wild deer, as hart, and buck, and roe, and swine, and\nbears and wolves withal.  The lord on the other side thereof was a\nmightier man than King Peter, albeit he was a bishop, and a baron of\nHoly Church.  To say sooth he was a close-fist and a manslayer; though\nhe did his manslaying through his vicars, the knights and men-at-arms\nwho held their manors of him, or whom he waged.\n\nIn that forest had King Peter's father died in battle, and his eldest\nson also; therefore, being a man of peace, he rode therein but seldom,\nthough his sons, the three eldest of them, had both ridden therein and\nran therefrom valiantly.  As for Ralph the youngest, his father would\nnot have him ride the Wood Debateable as yet.\n\nSo came those young men to the Want-ways, and found their father\nsitting there on a heap of stones, and over against him eight horses,\nfour destriers, and four hackneys, and four squires withal.  So they\ncame and stood before their father, waiting for his word, and wondering\nwhat it would be.\n\nNow spake King Peter:  \"Fair sons, ye would go on all adventure to seek\na wider land, and a more stirring life than ye may get of me at home:\nso be it!  But I have bethought me, that, since I am growing old and\npast the age of getting children, one of you, my sons, must abide at\nhome to cherish me and your mother, and to lead our carles in war if\ntrouble falleth upon us.  Now I know not how to choose by mine own wit\nwhich of you shall ride and which abide.  For so it is that ye are\ndiverse of your conditions; but the evil conditions which one of you\nlacks the other hath, and the valiancy which one hath, the other lacks.\nBlaise is wise and prudent, but no great man of his hands.  Hugh is a\nstout rider and lifter, but headstrong and foolhardy, and over\nbounteous a skinker; and Gregory is courteous and many worded, but\nsluggish in deed; though I will not call him a dastard.  As for Ralph,\nhe is fair to look on, and peradventure he may be as wise as Blaise, as\nvaliant as Hugh, and as smooth-tongued as Gregory; but of all this we\nknow little or nothing, whereas he is but young and untried.  Yet may\nhe do better than you others, and I deem that he will do so.  All\nthings considered, then, I say, I know not how to choose between you,\nmy sons; so let luck choose for me, and ye shall draw cuts for your\nroads; and he that draweth longest shall go north, and the next longest\nshall go east, and the third straw shall send the drawer west; but as\nto him who draweth the shortest cut, he shall go no whither but back\nagain to my house, there to abide with me the chances and changes of\nlife; and it is most like that this one shall sit in my chair when I am\ngone, and be called King of Upmeads.\n\n\"Now, my sons, doth this ordinance please you?  For if so be it doth\nnot, then may ye all abide at home, and eat of my meat, and drink of my\ncup, but little chided either for sloth or misdoing, even as it hath\nbeen aforetime.\"\n\nThe young men looked at one another, and Blaise answered and said:\n\"Sir, as for me I say we will do after your commandment, to take what\nroad luck may show us, or to turn back home again.\" They all yeasaid\nthis one after the other; and then King Peter said: \"Now before I draw\nthe cuts, I shall tell you that I have appointed the squires to go with\neach one of you.  Richard the Red shall go with Blaise; for though he\nbe somewhat stricken in years, and wise, yet is he a fierce carle and a\ndoughty, and knoweth well all feats of arms.\n\n\"Lancelot Longtongue shall be squire to Hugh; for he is good of seeming\nand can compass all courtesy, and knoweth logic (though it be of the\nlaw and not of the schools), yet is he a proper man of his hands; as\nneeds must he be who followeth Hugh; for where is Hugh, there is\ntrouble and debate.\n\n\"Clement the Black shall serve Gregory:  for he is a careful carle, and\nspeaketh one word to every ten deeds that he doeth; whether they be\ndone with point and edge, or with the hammer in the smithy.\n\n\"Lastly, I have none left to follow thee, Ralph, save Nicholas\nLongshanks; but though he hath more words than I have, yet hath he more\nwisdom, and is a man lettered and far-travelled, and loveth our house\nright well.\n\n\"How say ye, sons, is this to your liking?\"\n\nThey all said \"yea.\"  Then quoth the king; \"Nicholas, bring hither the\nstraws ready dight, and I will give them my sons to draw.\"\n\nSo each young man came up in turn and drew; and King Peter laid the\nstraws together and looked at them, and said:\n\n\"Thus it is, Hugh goeth north with Lancelot, Gregory westward with\nClement.\" He stayed a moment and then said:  \"Blaise fareth eastward\nand Richard with him.  As for thee, Ralph my dear son, thou shalt back\nwith me and abide in my house and I shall see thee day by day; and thou\nshalt help me to live my last years happily in all honour; and thy love\nshall be my hope, and thy valiancy my stay.\"\n\nTherewith he arose and threw his arm about the young man's neck; but he\nshrank away a little from his father, and his face grew troubled; and\nKing Peter noted that, and his countenance fell, and he said:\n\n\"Nay nay, my son; grudge not thy brethren the chances of the road, and\nthe ill-hap of the battle.  Here at least for thee is the bounteous\nboard and the full cup, and the love of kindred and well-willers, and\nthe fellowship of the folk.  O well is thee, my son, and happy shalt\nthou be!\"\n\nBut the young man knit his brows and said no word in answer.\n\nThen came forward those three brethren who were to fare at all\nadventure, and they stood before the old man saying nought.  Then he\nlaughed and said: \"O ho, my sons!  Here in Upmeads have ye all ye need\nwithout money, but when ye fare in the outlands ye need money; is it\nnot a lack of yours that your pouches be bare?  Abide, for I have seen\nto it.\"\n\nTherewith he drew out of his pouch three little bags, and said; \"Take\nye each one of these; for therein is all that my treasury may shed as\nnow.  In each of these is there coined money, both white and red, and\nsome deal of gold uncoined, and of rings and brooches a few, and by\nestimation there is in each bag the same value reckoned in lawful\nsilver of Upmeads and the Wolds and the Overhill-Countries. Take up\neach what there is, and do the best ye may therewith.\"\n\nThen each took his bag, and kissed and embraced his father; and they\nkissed Ralph and each other, and so got to horse and departed with\ntheir squires, going softly because of the hot sun.  But Nicholas\nslowly mounted his hackney and led Ralph's war-horse with him home\nagain to King Peter's House.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nRalph Goeth Back Home to the High House\n\n\nRalph and King Peter walked slowly home together, and as they went King\nPeter fell to telling of how in his young days he rode in the Wood\nDebateable, and was belated there all alone, and happed upon men who\nwere outlaws and wolfheads, and feared for his life; but they treated\nhim kindly, and honoured him, and saw him safe on his way in the\nmorning.  So that never thereafter would he be art and part with those\nwho hunted outlaws to slay them.  \"For,\" said he, \"it is with these men\nas with others, that they make prey of folk; yet these for the more\npart prey on the rich, and the lawful prey on the poor.  Otherwise it\nis with these wolfheads as with lords and knights and franklins, that\nas there be bad amongst them, so also there be good; and the good ones\nI happed on, and so may another man.\"\n\nHereto paid Ralph little heed at that time, since he had heard the tale\nand its morality before, and that more than once; and moreover his mind\nwas set upon his own matters and these was he pondering.  Albeit\nperchance the words abode with him.  So came they to the House, and\nRalph's mother, who was a noble dame, and well-liking as for her years,\nwhich were but little over fifty, stood in the hall-door to see which\nof her sons should come back to her, and when she saw them coming\ntogether, she went up to them, and cast her arms about Ralph and kissed\nhim and caressed him--being exceeding glad that it was he and not one\nof the others who had returned to dwell with them; for he was her\nbest-beloved, as was little marvel, seeing that he was by far the\nfairest and the most loving.  But Ralph's face grew troubled again in\nhis mother's arms, for he loved her exceeding well; and forsooth he\nloved the whole house and all that dwelt there, down to the turnspit\ndogs in the chimney ingle, and the swallows that nested in the earthen\nbottles, which when he was little he had seen his mother put up in the\neaves of the out-bowers: but now, love or no love, the spur was in his\nside, and he must needs hasten as fate would have him.  However, when\nhe had disentangled himself from his mother's caresses, he enforced\nhimself to keep a cheerful countenance, and upheld it the whole evening\nthrough, and was by seeming merry at supper, and went to bed singing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nRalph Cometh to the Cheaping-Town\n\n\nHe slept in an upper chamber in a turret of the House, which chamber\nwas his own, and none might meddle with it.  There the next day he\nawoke in the dawning, and arose and clad himself, and took his wargear\nand his sword and spear, and bore all away without doors to the side of\nthe Ford in that ingle of the river, and laid it for a while in a\nlittle willow copse, so that no chance-comer might see it; then he went\nback to the stable of the House and took his destrier from the stall\n(it was a dapple-grey horse called Falcon, and was right good,) and\nbrought him down to the said willow copse, and tied him to a tree till\nhe had armed himself amongst the willows, whence he came forth\npresently as brisk-looking and likely a man-at-arms as you might see on\na summer day.  Then he clomb up into the saddle, and went his ways\nsplashing across the ford, before the sun had arisen, while the\nthrostle-cocks were yet amidst their first song.\n\nThen he rode on a little trot south away; and by then the sun was up he\nwas without the bounds of Upmeads; albeit in the land thereabout dwelt\nnone who were not friends to King Peter and his sons: and that was\nwell, for now were folk stirring and were abroad in the fields; as a\nband of carles going with their scythes to the hay-field; or a maiden\nwith her milking-pails going to her kine, barefoot through the seeding\ngrass; or a company of noisy little lads on their way to the nearest\npool of the stream that they might bathe in the warm morning after the\nwarm night.  All these and more knew him and his armour and Falcon his\nhorse, and gave him the sele of the day, and he was nowise troubled at\nmeeting them; for besides that they thought it no wonder to meet one of\nthe lords of Upmeads going armed about his errands, their own errands\nwere close at home, and it was little likely that they should go that\nday so far as to Upmeads Water, seeing that it ran through the meadows\na half-score miles to the north-ward.\n\nSo Ralph rode on, and came into the high road, that led one way back\nagain into Upmeads, and crossed the Water by a fair bridge late builded\nbetween King Peter and a house of Canons on the north side, and the\nother way into a good cheaping-town hight Wulstead, beyond which Ralph\nknew little of the world which lay to the south, and seemed to him a\nwondrous place, full of fair things and marvellous adventures.\n\nSo he rode till he came into the town when the fair morning was still\nyoung, the first mass over, and maids gathered about the fountain\namidst the market-place, and two or three dames sitting under the\nbuttercross.  Ralph rode straight up to the house of a man whom he\nknew, and had often given him guesting there, and he himself was not\nseldom seen in the High House of Upmeads.  This man was a merchant, who\nwent and came betwixt men's houses, and bought and sold many things\nneedful and pleasant to folk, and King Peter dealt with him much and\noften.  Now he stood in the door of his house, which was new and\ngoodly, sniffing the sweet scents which the morning wind bore into the\ntown; he was clad in a goodly long gown of grey welted with silver, of\nthin cloth meet for the summer-tide: for little he wrought with his\nhands, but much with his tongue; he was a man of forty summers,\nruddy-faced and black-bearded, and he was called Clement Chapman.\n\nWhen he saw Ralph he smiled kindly on him, and came and held his\nstirrup as he lighted down, and said:  \"Welcome, lord!  Art thou come\nto give me a message, and eat and drink in a poor huckster's house, and\nthou armed so gallantly?\"\n\nRalph laughed merrily, for he was hungry, and he said: \"Yea, I will eat\nand drink with thee and kiss my gossip, and go my ways.\"\n\nTherewith the carle led him into the house; and if it were goodly\nwithout, within it was better.  For there was a fair chamber panelled\nwith wainscot well carven, and a cupboard of no sorry vessels of silver\nand latten: the chairs and stools as fair as might be; no king's might\nbe better: the windows were glazed, and there were flowers and knots\nand posies in them; and the bed was hung with goodly web from over sea\nsuch as the soldan useth.  Also, whereas the chapman's ware-bowers were\nhard by the chamber, there was a pleasant mingled smell therefrom\nfloating about.  The table was set with meat and drink and vessel of\npewter and earth, all fair and good; and thereby stood the chapman's\nwife, a very goodly woman of two-score years, who had held Ralph at the\nfont when she was a slim damsel new wedded; for she was come of no mean\nkindred of the Kingdom of Upmeads: her name was Dame Katherine.\n\nNow she kissed Ralph's cheek friendly, and said: \"Welcome, gossip! thou\nart here in good time to break thy fast; and we will give thee a trim\ndinner thereafter, when thou hast been here and there in the town and\ndone thine errand; and then shalt thou drink a cup and sing me a song,\nand so home again in the cool of the evening.\"\n\nRalph seemed a little troubled at her word, and he said: \"Nay, gossip,\nthough I thank thee for all these good things as though I had them, yet\nmust I ride away south straightway after I have breakfasted, and said\none word to the goodman.  Goodman, how call ye the next town southward,\nand how far is it thither?\"\n\nQuoth Clement:  \"My son, what hast thou to do with riding south?  As\nthou wottest, going hence south ye must presently ride the\nhill-country; and that is no safe journey for a lonely man, even if he\nbe a doughty knight like to thee, lord.\"\n\nSaid Ralph, reddening withal:  \"I have an errand that way.\"\n\n\"An errand of King Peter's or thine own?\" said Clement.\n\n\"Of King Peter's, if ye must wot,\" said Ralph.\n\nClement were no chapman had he not seen that the lad was lying; so he\nsaid:\n\n\"Fair lord, saving your worship, how would it be as to the speeding of\nKing Peter's errand, if I brought thee before our mayor, and swore the\npeace against thee; so that I might keep thee in courteous prison till\nI had sent to thy father of thy whereabouts?\"\n\nThe young man turned red with anger; but ere he could speak Dame\nKatherine said sharply:  \"Hold thy peace, Clement!  What hast thou to\nmeddle or make in the matter?  If our young lord hath will to ride out\nand see the world, why should we let him?  Yea, why should his father\nlet him, if it come to that?  Take my word for it that my gossip shall\ngo through the world and come back to those that love him, as goodly as\nhe went forth.  And hold! here is for a token thereof.\"\n\nTherewith she went to an ark that stood in the corner, and groped in\nthe till thereof and brought out a little necklace of blue and green\nstones with gold knobs betwixt, like a pair of beads; albeit neither\npope nor priest had blessed them; and tied to the necklace was a little\nbox of gold with something hidden therein.  This gaud she gave to\nRalph, and said to him: \"Gossip, wear this about thy neck, and let no\nman take it from thee, and I think it will be salvation to thee in\nperil, and good luck to thee in the time of questing; so that it shall\nbe to thee as if thou hadst drunk of the WELL AT THE WORLD'S END.\"\n\n\"What is that water?\" said Ralph, \"and how may I find it?\"\n\n\"I know not rightly,\" she said, \"but if a body might come by it, I hear\nsay it saveth from weariness and wounding and sickness; and it winneth\nlove from all, and maybe life everlasting.  Hast thou not heard tell of\nit, my husband?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the chapman, \"many times; and how that whoso hath drunk\nthereof hath the tongue that none may withstand, whether in buying or\nselling, or prevailing over the hearts of men in any wise.  But as for\nits wherabouts, ye shall not find it in these parts.  Men say that it\nis beyond the Dry Tree; and that is afar, God wot!  But now, lord\nRalph, I rede thee go back again this evening with Andrew, my nephew,\nfor company:  forsooth, he will do little less gainful than riding with\nthee to Upmeads than if he abide in Wulstead; for he is idle.  But, my\nlord, take it not amiss that I spake about the mayor and the tipstaves;\nfor it was but a jest, as thou mayest well wot.\"\n\nRalph's face cleared at that word, and he stood smiling, weighing the\nchaplet in his hand; but Dame Katherine said:\n\n\"Dear gossip, do it on speedily; for it is a gift from me unto thee:\nand from a gossip even king's sons may take a gift.\"\n\nQuoth Ralph:  \"But is it lawful to wear it? is there no wizardry within\nit?\"\n\n\"Hearken to him!\" she said, \"and how like unto a man he speaketh; if\nthere were a brawl in the street, he would strike in and ask no word\nthereof, not even which were the better side: whereas here is my\nfalcon-chick frighted at a little gold box and a pair of Saracen beads.\"\n\n\"Well,\" quoth Ralph, \"the first holy man I meet shall bless them for\nme.\"\n\n\"That shall he not,\" said the dame, \"that shall he not.  Who wotteth\nwhat shall betide to thee or me if he do so?  Come, do them on, and\nthen to table!  For seest thou not that the goodman is wearying for\nmeat? and even thine eyes will shine the brighter for a mouthful,\nking's son and gossip.\"\n\nShe took him by the hand and did the beads on his neck and kissed and\nfondled him before he sat down, while the goodman looked on, grinning\nrather sheepishly, but said nought to them; and only called on his boy\nto lead the destrier to stable.  So when they were set down, the\nchapman took up the word where it had been dropped, and said:  \"So,\nLord Ralph, thou must needs take to adventures, being, as thou deemest,\nfull grown.  That is all one as the duck taketh to water despite of the\nhen that hath hatched her.  Well, it was not to be thought that Upmeads\nwould hold you lords much longer.  Or what is gone with my lords your\nbrethren?\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"They have departed at all adventure, north, east, and\nwest, each bearing our father's blessing and a bag of pennies.  And to\nspeak the truth, goodman, for I perceive I am no doctor at lying, my\nfather and mother would have me stay at home when my brethren were\ngone, and that liketh me not; therefore am I come out to seek my luck\nin the world: for Upmeads is good for a star-gazer, maybe, or a\nsimpler, or a priest, or a worthy good carle of the fields, but not for\na king's son with the blood running hot in his veins.  Or what sayest\nthou, gossip?\"\n\nQuoth the dame:  \"I could weep for thy mother; but for thee nought at\nall.  It is good that thou shouldest do thy will in the season of youth\nand the days of thy pleasure.  Yea, and I deem that thou shalt come\nback again great and worshipful; and I am called somewhat foreseeing.\nOnly look to it that thou keep the pretty thing that I have just given\nthee.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the chapman, \"this is fine talk about pleasure and the\ndoing of one's will; nevertheless a whole skin is good wares, though it\nbe not to be cheapened in any market of the world.  Now, lord, go thou\nwhere thou wilt, whether I say go or abide; and forsooth I am no man of\nKing Peter's, that I should stay thee.  As for the name of the next\ntown, it is called Higham-on-the-Way, and is a big town plenteous of\nvictuals, with strong walls and a castle, and a very rich abbey of\nmonks:  and there is peace within its walls, because the father abbot\nwages a many men to guard him and his, and to uphold his rights against\nall comers; wherein he doth wisely, and also well.  For much folk\nflocketh to his town and live well therein; and there is great recourse\nof chapmen thither.  No better market is there betwixt this and\nBabylon.  Well, Sir Ralph, I rede thee if thou comest unhurt to\nHigham-on-the-Way, go no further for this time, but take service with\nthe lord abbot, and be one of his men of war; thou may'st then become\nhis captain if thou shouldest live; which would be no bad adventure for\none who cometh from Upmeads.\"\n\nRalph looked no brighter for this word, and he answered nought to it:\nbut said presently:\n\n\"And what is to be looked for beyond Higham if one goeth further?  Dost\nthou know the land any further?\"\n\nThe carle smiled:  \"Yea forsooth, and down to the Wood Perilous, and\nbeyond it, and the lands beyond the Wood; and far away through them.  I\nsay not that I have been to the Dry Tree; but I have spoken to one who\nhath heard of him who hath seen it; though he might not come by a\ndraught of the Well at the World's End.\"\n\nRalph's eyes flashed, and his cheeks reddened as he listened hereto;\nbut he spake quietly:\n\n\"Master Clement, how far dost thou make it to Higham-on-the-Way?\"\n\n\"A matter of forty miles,\" said the Chapman; \"because, as thou wottest,\nif ye ride south from hence, ye shall presently bring your nose up\nagainst the big downs, and must needs climb them at once; and when ye\nare at the top of Bear Hill, and look south away ye shall see nought\nbut downs on downs with never a road to call a road, and never a\ncastle, or church, or homestead:  nought but some shepherd's hut; or at\nthe most the little house of a holy man with a little chapel thereby in\nsome swelly of the chalk, where the water hath trickled into a pool;\nfor otherwise the place is waterless.\" Therewith he took a long pull at\nthe tankard by his side, and went on:\n\n\"Higham is beyond all that, and out into the fertile plain; and a\nlittle river hight Coldlake windeth about the meadows there; and it is\na fair land; though look you the wool of the downs is good, good, good!\nI have foison of this year's fleeces with me.  Ye shall raise none such\nin Upmeads.\"\n\nRalph sat silent a little, as if pondering, and then he started up and\nsaid: \"Good master Clement, we have eaten thy meat and thank thee for\nthat and other matters.  Wilt thou now be kinder, and bid thy boy bring\nround Falcon our horse; for we have far to go, and must begone\nstraight-away.\"\n\n\"Yea, lord,\" said Clement, \"even so will I do.\"  And he muttered under\nhis breath; \"Thou talkest big, my lad, with thy 'we'; but thou art\npressed lest Nicholas be here presently to fetch thee back; and to say\nsooth I would his hand were on thy shoulder even now.\"\n\nThen he spake aloud again, and said:\n\n\"I must now begone to my lads, and I will send one round with thy\nwar-horse. But take my rede, my lord, and become the man of the Abbot\nof St. Mary's of Higham, and all will be well.\"\n\nTherewith he edged himself out of the chamber, and the dame fell to\nmaking a mighty clatter with the vessel and trenchers and cups on the\nboard, while Ralph walked up and down the chamber his war-gear jingling\nupon him.  Presently the dame left her table-clatter and came up to\nRalph and looked kindly into his face and said:  \"Gossip, hast thou\nperchance any money?\"\n\nHe flushed up red, and then his face fell; yet he spake gaily: \"Yea,\ngossip, I have both white and red:  there are three golden crowns in my\npouch, and a little flock of silver pennies: forsooth I say not as many\nas would reach from here to Upmeads, if they were laid one after the\nother.\"\n\nShe smiled and patted his cheek, and said:\n\n\"Thou art no very prudent child, king's son.  But it comes into my mind\nthat my master did not mean thee to go away empty-handed; else had he\nnot departed and left us twain together.\"\n\nTherewith she went to the credence that stood in a corner, and opened a\ndrawer therein and took out a little bag, and gave it into Ralph's\nhand, and said:  \"This is the gift of the gossip; and thou mayst take\nit without shame; all the more because if thy father had been a worser\nman, and a harder lord he would have had more to give thee.  But now\nthou hast as much or more as any one of thy brethren.\"\n\nHe took the bag smiling and shame-faced, but she looked on him fondly\nand said:\n\n\"Now I know not whether I shall lay old Nicholas on thine heels when he\ncometh after thee, as come he will full surely; or whether I shall\nsuffer the old sleuth-hound nose out thy slot of himself, as full\nsurely he will set on to it.\"\n\n\"Thou mightest tell him,\" said Ralph, \"that I am gone to take service\nwith the Abbot of St. Mary's of Higham:  hah?\"\n\nShe laughed and said:  \"Wilt thou do so, lord, and follow the rede of\nthat goodman of mine, who thinketh himself as wise as Solomon?\"\n\nRalph smiled and answered her nothing.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I shall say what likes me when the hour is at hand.\nLo, here! thine horse.  Abide yet a moment of time, and then go whither\nthou needs must, like the wind of the summer day.\"\n\nTherewith she went out of the chamber and came back again with a scrip\nwhich she gave to Ralph and said:  \"Herein is a flask of drink for the\nwaterless country, and a little meat for the way.  Fare thee well,\ngossip!  Little did I look for it when I rose up this morning and\nnothing irked me save the dulness of our town, and the littleness of\nmen's doings therein, that I should have to cut off a piece of my life\nfrom me this morning, and say, farewell gossip, as now again I do.\"\n\nTherewith she kissed him on either cheek and embraced him; and it might\nbe said of her and him that she let him go thereafter; for though as\naforesaid he loved her, and praised her kindness, he scarce understood\nthe eagerness of her love for him; whereas moreover she saw him not so\noften betwixt Upmeads and Wulstead:  and belike she herself scarce\nunderstood it.  Albeit she was a childless woman.\n\nSo when he had got to horse, she watched him riding a moment, and saw\nhow he waved his hand to her as he turned the corner of the\nmarket-place, and how a knot of lads and lasses stood staring on him\nafter she lost sight of him.  Then she turned her back into the chamber\nand laid her head on the table and wept.  Then came in the goodman\nquietly and stood by her and she heeded him not.  He stood grinning\ncuriously on her awhile, and then laid his hand on her shoulder, and\nsaid as she raised her face to him:\n\n\"Sweetheart, it availeth nought; when thou wert young and exceeding\nfair, he was but a little babe, and thou wert looking in those days to\nhave babes of thine own; and then it was too soon: and now that he is\nsuch a beauteous young man, and a king's son withal, and thou art\nwedded to a careful carle of no weak heart, and thou thyself art more\nthan two-score years old, it is too late.  Yet thou didst well to give\nour lord the money.  Lo! here is wherewithal to fill up the lack in thy\nchest; and here is a toy for thee in place of the pair of beads thou\ngavest him; and I bid thee look on it as if I had given him my share of\nthe money and the beads.\"\n\nShe turned to Clement, and took the bag of money, and the chaplet which\nhe held out to her, and she said: \"God wot thou art no ill man, my\nhusband, but would God I had a son like to him!\"\n\nShe still wept somewhat; but the chapman said:  \"Let it rest there,\nsweetheart! let it rest there!  It may be a year or twain before thou\nseest him again:  and then belike he shall be come back with some woman\nwhom he loves better than any other; and who knows but in a way he may\ndeem himself our son.  Meanwhile thou hast done well, sweetheart, so be\nglad.\"\n\nTherewith he kissed her and went his ways to his merchandize, and she\nto the ordering of her house, grieved but not unhappy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nRalph Rideth the Downs\n\n\nAs for Ralph, he rode on with a merry heart, and presently came to an\nend of the plain country, and the great downs rose up before him with a\nwhite road winding up to the top of them.  Just before the slopes began\nto rise was a little thorp beside a stream, and thereby a fair church\nand a little house of Canons: so Ralph rode toward the church to see if\ntherein were an altar of St. Nicholas, who was his good lord and\npatron, that he might ask of him a blessing on his journey.  But as he\ncame up to the churchyard-gate he saw a great black horse tied thereto\nas if abiding some one; and as he lighted down from his saddle he saw a\nman coming hastily from out the church-door and striding swiftly toward\nthe said gate.  He was a big man, and armed; for he had a bright steel\nsallet on his head, which covered his face all save the end of his\nchin; and plates he had on his legs and arms.  He wore a green coat\nover his armour, and thereon was wrought in gold an image of a tree\nleafless:  he had a little steel axe about his neck, and a great sword\nhung by his side.  Ralph stood looking on him with his hand on the\nlatch of the gate, but when the man came thereto he tore it open\nroughly and shoved through at once, driving Ralph back, so that he\nwell-nigh overset him, and so sprang to his horse and swung himself\ninto the saddle, just as Ralph steadied himself and ruffled up to him,\nhalf drawing his sword from the scabbard the while.  But the\nman-at-arms cried out, \"Put it back, put it back!  If thou must needs\ndeal with every man that shoveth thee in his haste, thy life is like to\nbe but short.\"\n\nHe was settling himself in his saddle as he spoke, and now he shook his\nrein, and rode off speedily toward the hill-road.  But when he was so\nfar off that Ralph might but see his face but as a piece of reddish\ncolour, he reined up for a moment of time, and turning round in his\nsaddle lifted up his sallet and left his face bare, and cried out as if\nto Ralph, \"The first time!\" And then let the head-piece fall again, and\nset spurs to his horse and gallopped away.\n\nRalph stood looking at him as he got smaller on the long white road,\nand wondering what this might mean, and how the unknown man should know\nhim, if he did know him.  But presently he let his wonder run off him,\nand went his ways into the church, wherein he found his good lord and\nfriend St. Nicholas, and so said a paternoster before his altar, and\nbesought his help, and made his offering; and then departed and gat to\nhorse again, and rode softly the way to the downs, for the day was hot.\n\nThe way was steep and winding, with a hollow cup of the hills below it,\nand above it a bent so steep that Ralph could see but a few yards of it\non his left hand; but when he came to the hill's brow and could look\ndown on the said bent, he saw strange figures on the face thereof, done\nby cutting away the turf so that the chalk might show clear.  A tree\nwith leaves was done on that hill-side, and on either hand of it a\nbeast like a bear ramping up against the tree; and these signs were\nvery ancient.  This hill-side carving could not be seen from the thorp\nbeneath, which was called Netherton, because the bent looked westward\ndown into the hollow of the hill abovesaid; but from nigher to Wulstead\nthey were clear to see, and Ralph had often beheld them, but never so\nnigh: and that hill was called after them Bear Hill.  At the top of it\nwas an earth-work of the ancient folk, which also was called Bear\nCastle.  And now Ralph rode over the hill's brow into it; for the walls\nhad been beaten down in places long and long ago.\n\nNow he rode up the wall, and at the topmost of it turned and looked\naback on the blue country which he had ridden through stretching many a\nleague below, and tried if he could pick out Upmeads from amongst the\ndiverse wealth of the summer land: but Upmeads Water was hidden, and he\ncould see nothing to be sure of to tell him whereabouts the High House\nstood; yet he deemed that he could make out the Debateable Wood and the\nhills behind it well enough.  Then he turned his horse about, and had\nthe down-country before him; long lines of hills to wit, one rising\nbehind the other like the waves of a somewhat quiet sea: no trees\nthereon, nor houses that he might see thence: nought but a green road\nthat went waving up and down before him greener than the main face of\nthe slopes.\n\nHe looked at it all for a minute or two as the south-west wind went\npast his ears, and played a strange tune on the innumerable stems of\nthe bents and the hard-stalked blossoms, to which the bees sang\ncounterpoint.  Then the heart arose within him, and he drew the sword\nfrom the scabbard, and waved it about his head, and shook it toward the\nsouth, and cried out, \"Now, welcome world, and be thou blessed from one\nend to the other, from the ocean sea to the uttermost mountains!\"\n\nA while he held the white steel in his fist, and then sheathed the\nblade, and rode down soberly over the turf bridge across the ancient\nfosse, and so came on to the green road made many ages before by an\nancient people, and so trotted south along fair and softly.\n\nLittle is to be told of his journey through the downs: as he topped a\nlow hill whereon were seven grave-mounds of the ancient folk in a row,\nhe came on a shepherd lying amidst of his sheep: the man sprang to his\nfeet when he heard horse-hoofs anigh him and saw the glint of steel,\nand he set his hand to a short spear which lay by him; but when he saw\nnought but Ralph, and heard how he gave him the sele of the day, he\nnodded his head in a friendly way, though he said nought in salutation;\nfor the loneliness of the downs made the speech slow within him.\n\nAgain some two miles further on Ralph met a flock of sheep coming down\na bent which the road climbed, and with them were three men, their\ndrovers, and they drew nigh him as he was amidst of the sheep, so that\nhe could scarce see the way.  Each of these three had a weapon; one a\npole-axe, another a long spear, and the third a flail jointed and bound\nwith iron, and an anlace hanging at his girdle.  So they stood in the\nway and hailed him when the sheep were gone past; and the man with the\nspear asked him whither away.  \"I am turned toward Higham-on-the-Way,\"\nquoth he; \"and how many miles shall I ride ere I get there?\"\n\nSaid one of them:  \"Little less than twenty, lord.\"  Now it was past\nnoon two hours, and the day was hot; so whereas the faces of the men\nlooked kind and friendly, albeit somewhat rugged, he lighted down from\nhis horse and sat down by the way-side, and drew his bottle of good\nwine from out of his wallet, and asked the men if they were in haste.\n\"Nay, master,\" said he of the pole-axe, while all eyes turned to the\nbottle, \"HE has gone by too long; and will neither meddle with us, nor\nmay we deal with him.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" quoth Ralph, \"there is time for bever.  Have ye ought of a\ncup, that we may drink to each other?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the carle with the anlace, \"that have I.\" Therewith he drew\nfrom his pouch a ram's horn rimmed with silver, and held it up, and\nsaid as if he were speaking to it:  \"Now, Thirly, rejoice! for ye shall\nhave lord's wine poured into thy maw.\"\n\nTherewith he held it out toward Ralph, who laughed and filled it up,\nand filled for himself a little silver cup which he carried, and said:\n\"To you, shepherds!  Much wool and little cry!\" And he drank withal.\n\n\"And I,\" quoth the man with the horn, \"call this health; Much cry and\nlittle wool!\"\n\n\"Well, well, how mean ye by that, Greasy Wat?\" said the man with the\nspear, taking the horn as he spake; \"that is but a poor wish for a lord\nthat drinketh out of our cup.\"\n\nSaid Wat:  \"Why, neighbour, why! thy wit is none too hasty.  The wool\nthat a knight sheareth is war and battle; that is wounding and death;\nbut the cry is the talk and boasting and minstrelsy that goeth before\nall this.  Which is the best wish to wish him? the wounds and the\ndeath, or the fore-rumour and stir thereof which hurteth no man?\"\n\nRalph laughed thereat, and was merry and blithe with them; but the\nspearman, who was an old man, said:\n\n\"For all Wat sayeth, lord, and his japes, ye must not misdeem of us\nthat we shepherds of the Downs can do nought but run to ales and\nfeasts, and that we are but pot-valiant: maybe thou thyself mayst live\nto see things go otherwise:  and in that day may we have such as thee\nfor captain.  Now, fair lord, I drink to thy crown of valour, and thy\ngood luck; and we thank thee for the wine and yet more for the blithe\nfellowship.\"\n\nSo Ralph filled up the ram's horn till Dame Katherine's good island\nwine was well-nigh spent; and at last he said:\n\n\"Now, my masters, I must to horse; but I pray you tell or we depart,\nwhat did ye mean when ye said that HE had gone past?  Who is HE?\"\n\nThe merry faces of the men changed at his word, and they looked in each\nother's faces, till at last the old spearman answered him:\n\n\"Fair lord, these things we have little will to talk about: for we be\npoor men with no master to fleece us, and no lord to help us: also we\nbe folk unlearned and unlettered, and from our way of life, whereas we\ndwell in the wilderness, we seldom come within the doors of a church.\nBut whereas we have drunk with thee, who seemest to be a man of\nlineage, and thou hast been blithe with us, we will tell thee that we\nhave seen one riding south along the Greenway, clad in a coat as green\nas the way, with the leafless tree done on his breast.  So nigh to him\nwe were that we heard his cry as he sped along, as ye may hear the\nlapwing whining; for he said: 'POINT AND EDGE, POINT AND EDGE!  THE RED\nWATER AMIDST OF THE HILLS!' In my lifetime such a man hath, to my\nknowledge, been seen thrice before; and after each sight of him\nfollowed evil days and the death of men.  Moreover this is the Eve of\nSt. John, and we deem the token the worse therefor.  Or how deemest\nthou?\"\n\nRalph stood silent awhile; for he was thinking of the big man whom he\nhad met at the churchyard gate, and all this tale seemed wonderful to\nhim.  But at last he said:\n\n\"I cannot tell what there is in it; herein am I no help to you.  To-day\nI am but little; though I may one day be great.  Yet this may I do for\nyou; tomorrow will I let sing a mass in St. Mary's Church on your\nbehoof.  And hereafter, if I wax as my will is, and I come to be lord\nin these lands, I will look to it to do what a good lord should do for\nthe shepherds of the Downs, so that they may live well, and die in good\nhope.  So may the Mother of God help me at need!\"\n\nSaid the old shepherd:  \"Thou hast sworn an oath, and it is a good\noath, and well sworn.  Now if thou dost as thou swearest, words can but\nlittle thanks, yet deeds may.  Wherefore if ever thou comest back\nhither, and art in such need that a throng of men may help thee\ntherein; then let light a great fire upon each corner of the topmost\nwall of Bear Castle, and call to mind this watch-word: 'SMITE ASIDE THE\nAXE, O BEAR-FATHER,' and then shalt thou see what shall betide thee for\nthy good-hap: farewell now, with the saints to aid!\"\n\nRalph bade them live well and hail, and mounted his horse and rode off\ndown the Greenway, and as he rode the shepherds waved their weapons to\nhim in token of good-will.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nRalph Cometh to Higham-on-the-Way\n\n\nNought more befell Ralph to tell of till he came to the end of the\nDowns and saw Higham lying below him overlooked by a white castle on a\nknoll, and with a river lapping it about and winding on through its\nfair green meadows even as Clement had told.  From amidst its houses\nrose up three towers of churches above their leaden roofs, and high\nabove all, long and great, the Abbey Church; and now was the low sun\nglittering on its gilded vanes and the wings of the angels high upon\nthe battlements.\n\nSo Ralph rode down the slopes and was brisk about it, for it was\ndrawing toward sunset, and he knew not at what hour they shut their\ngates.  The road was steep and winding, and it was the more part of an\nhour ere he came to the gate, which was open, and like to be yet, for\nmany folk were thronging in, which throng also had hindered him soon\nafter he came into the plain country.  The gate was fair and strong,\nbut Ralph saw no men-at-arms about it that evening.  He rode into the\nstreet unquestioned, and therein was the throng great of people clad in\nfair and gay attire; and presently Ralph called to mind that this was\nSt. John's Eve, so that he knew that there was some feast toward.\n\nAt last the throng was so thick that he was stayed by it; and\ntherewithal a religious who was beside him and thrust up against his\nhorse, turned to him and gave him good even, and said:  \"By thy weapons\nand gear thou art a stranger here in our burg, Sir Knight?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"And whither away?\" said the monk; \"hast thou some kinsman or friend in\nthe town?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"I seek a good hostelry where I may abide the night\nfor my money.\"\n\nThe monk shook his head and said:  \"See ye the folk?  It is holiday\ntime, and midsummer after haysel.  Ye shall scarce get lodging outside\nour house.  But what then?  Come thou thither straightway and have\nharbour of the best, and see our prior, who loveth young and brisk\nmen-at-arms like to thee.  Lo now! the throng openeth a little; I will\nwalk by thy bridle and lead thee the shortest road thither.\"\n\nRalph gainsaid him not, and they bored through the throng of the street\ntill they came into the market-square, which was very great and clean,\npaved with stones all over:  tall and fair houses rose up on three\nsides of it, and on the fourth was the Great Church which made those\nhouses seem but low: most of it was new-built; for the lord Abbot that\nthen was, though he had not begun it, had taken the work up from his\nforerunner and had pushed it forward all he might; for he was very\nrich, and an open-handed man.  Like dark gold it showed under the\nevening sun, and the painted and gilded imagery shone like jewels upon\nit.\n\n\"Yea,\" said the monk, as he noted Ralph's wonder at this wonder; \"a\nmost goodly house it is, and happy shall they be that dwell there.\"\n\nTherewith he led Ralph on, turning aside through the great square.\nRalph saw that there were many folk therein, though it was too big to\nbe thronged thick with them.  Amidst of it was now a great pile of wood\nhung about with flowers, and hard by it a stage built up with hangings\nof rich cloth on one side thereof.  He asked the monk what this might\nmean, and he told him the wood was for the Midsummer bale-fire, and the\nstage for the show that should come thereafter.  So the brother led\nRalph down a lane to the south of the great west door, and along the\nside of the minster and so came to the Abbey gate, and there was Ralph\nwell greeted, and had all things given him which were due to a good\nknight; and then was he brought into the Guest-hall, a very fair\nchamber, which was now full of men of all degrees.  He was shown to a\nseat on the dais within two of the subprior's, and beside him sat an\nhonourable lord, a vassal of St. Mary's. So was supper served well and\nabundantly:  the meat and drink was of the best, and the vessel and all\nthe plenishing was as good as might be; and the walls of that chamber\nwere hung with noble arras-cloth picturing the Pilgrimage of the Soul\nof Man.\n\nEvery man there who spoke with Ralph, and they were many, was exceeding\ncourteous to him; and he heard much talk about him of the wealth of the\nlands of St. Mary's at Higham, and how it was flourishing; and of the\nAbbot how mighty he was, so that he might do what he would, and that\nhis will was to help and to give, and be blithe with all men: and folk\ntold of turmoil and war in other lands, and praised the peace of\nHigham-on-the-Way.\n\nRalph listened to all this, and smiled, and said to himself that to\nanother man this might well be the end of his journey for that time;\nbut for him all this peace and well-being was not enough; for though it\nwere a richer land than Upmeads, yet to the peace and the quiet he was\nwell used, and he had come forth not for the winning of fatter peace,\nbut to try what new thing his youth and his might and his high hope and\nhis good hap might accomplish.\n\nSo when the supper was over, and the wine and spices had been brought,\nthe Guest-hall began to thin somewhat, and the brother who had brought\nRalph thither came to him and said:\n\n\"Fair lord, it were nowise ill if ye went forth, as others of our\nguests have done, to see the deeds of Midsummer Eve that shall be done\nin the great square in honour of Holy John; for our manner therein at\nHigham has been much thought of.  Look my son!\"\n\nHe pointed to the windows of the hall therewith, and lo! they grew\nyellow and bright with some fire without, as if a new fiery day had\nbeen born out of the dusk of the summer night; for the light that shone\nthrough the windows out-did the candle-light in the hall.  Ralph\nstarted thereat and laid his right hand to the place of his sword,\nwhich indeed he had left with the chamberlain; but the monk laughed and\nsaid:  \"Fear nothing, lord; there is no foeman in Higham: come now,\nlest thou be belated of the show.\"\n\nSo he led Ralph forth, and into the square, where there was a space\nappointed for the brethren and their guests to see the plays; and the\nsquare was now so full of folk that it seemed like as if that there\nwere no one man in the streets which were erewhile so thronged.\n\nThere were rows of men-at-arms in bright armour also to keep the folk\nin their places, like as hurdles pen the sheep up; howbeit they were\nnowise rough with folk, but humble and courteous.  Many and many were\nthe torches and cressets burning steadily in the calm air, so that, as\naforesaid, night was turned into day.  But on the scaffold aforesaid\nwere standing bright and gay figures, whose names or what they were\nRalph had no time to ask.\n\nNow the bells began to clash from the great tower of the minster, and\nin a little while they had clashed themselves into order and rang clear\nand tuneably for a space; and while they were ringing, lo! those\ngay-clad people departed from the scaffold, and a canvas painted like a\nmountain-side, rocky and with caves therein, was drawn up at the back\nof it.  Then came thereon one clad like a king holding a fair maiden by\nthe hand, and with him was a dame richly clad and with a crown on her\nhead.  So these two kissed the maiden, and lamented over her, and went\ntheir ways, and the maiden left alone sat down upon a rock and covered\nup her face and wept; and while Ralph wondered what this might mean, or\nwhat grieved the maiden, there came creeping, as it were from out of a\ncranny of the rocks, a worm huge-headed and covered over with scales\nthat glittered in the torch-light. Then Ralph sprang up in his place,\nfor he feared for the maiden that the worm would devour her:  but the\nmonk who sat by him pulled him down by the skirt, and laughed and said:\n\"Sit still, lord! for the champion also has been provided.\"\n\nThen Ralph sat down again somewhat abashed and looked on; yet was his\nheart in his mouth the while.  And so while the maiden stood as one\nastonied before the worm, who gaped upon her with wide open mouth,\nthere came forth from a cleft in the rocks a goodly knight who bore\nsilver, a red cross; and he had his sword in his hand, and he fell upon\nthe worm to smite him; and the worm ramped up against him, and there\nwas battle betwixt them, while the maiden knelt anigh with her hands\nclasped together.\n\nThen Ralph knew that this was a play of the fight of St. George with\nthe worm; so he sat silent till the champion had smitten off the worm's\nhead and had come to the maiden and kissed and embraced her, and shown\nher the grisly head.  Then presently came many folk on to the scaffold,\nto wit, the king and queen who were the father and mother of the\nmaiden, and a bishop clad in very fair vestments, and knights withal;\nand they stood about St. George and the maiden, and with them were\nminstrels who fell to playing upon harps and fiddles; while other some\nfell to singing a sweet song in honour of St. George, and the maiden\ndelivered.\n\nSo when it was all done, the monk said:  \"This play is set forth by the\nmen-at-arms of our lord Abbot, who have great devotion toward St.\nGeorge, and he is their friend and their good lord.  But hereafter will\nbe other plays, of wild men and their feasting in the woods in the\nGolden Age of the world; and that is done by the scribes and the\nlimners.  And after that will be a pageant of St. Agnes ordered by the\nclothiers and the webbers, which be both many and deft in this good\ntown.  Albeit thou art a young man and hast ridden far to-day belike,\nand mayhappen thou wilt not be able to endure it: so it may be well to\nbring thee out of this throng straightway.  Moreover I have bethought\nme, that there is much of what is presently to come which we shall see\nbetter from the minster roof, or even it may be from the tower:  wilt\nthou come then?\"\n\nRalph had liefer have sat there and seen all the plays to the end, for\nthey seemed to him exceeding fair, and like to ravish the soul from the\nbody; howbeit, being shamefaced, he knew not how to gainsay the\nbrother, who took him by the hand, and led him through the press to the\nwest front of the minster, where on the north side was a little door in\na nook.  So they went up a stair therein a good way till they came into\na gallery over the western door; and looking forth thence Ralph deemed\nthat he could have seen a long way had daylight been, for it was higher\nthan the tops of the highest houses.\n\nSo there they abode a space looking down on the square and its throng,\nand the bells, which had been ringing when they came up, now ceased a\nwhile.  But presently there arose great shouts and clamour amongst the\nfolk below, and they could see men with torches drawing near to the\npile of wood, and then all of a sudden shot up from it a great spiring\nflame, and all the people shouted together, while the bells broke out\nagain over their heads.\n\nThen the brother pointed aloof with his finger and said: \"Lo you! fair\nlord, how bale speaks to bale all along the headlands of the\ndown-country, and below there in the thorps by the river!\"\n\nForsooth Ralph saw fire after fire break out to the westward; and the\nbrother said:  \"And if we stood over the high altar and looked east, ye\nwould see more of such fires and many more; and all these bales are\npiled up and lighted by vassals and villeins of my lord Abbot: now\nto-night they are but mere Midsummer bale-fires; but doubt ye not that\nif there came war into the land each one of these bales would mean at\nleast a half-score of stout men, archers and men-at-arms, all ready to\nserve their lord at all adventure.  All this the tyrants round about,\nthat hate holy Church and oppress the poor, know full well; therefore\nwe live in peace in these lands.\"\n\nRalph hearkened, but said nought; for amidst all this flashing of fire\nand flame, and the crying out of folk, and the measured clash of the\nbells so near him, his thought was confused, and he had no words ready\nto hand.  But the monk turned from the parapet and looked him full in\nthe face and said to him:\n\n\"Thou art a fair young man, and strong, and of gentle blood as I deem;\nand thou seemest to me to have the lucky look in thine eyes: now I tell\nthee that if thou wert to take service with my lord thou shouldest\nnever rue it.  Yea, why shouldest thou not wax in his service, and\nbecome his Captain of Captains, which is an office meet for kings?\"\n\nRalph looked on him, but answered nought, for he could not gather his\nthoughts for an answer; and the brother said: \"Think of it, I bid thee,\nfair young lord; and be sure that nowhere shalt thou have a better\nlivelihood, not even wert thou a king's son; for the children of my\nlord Abbot are such that none dareth to do them any displeasure;\nneither is any overlord as good as is Holy Church.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"doubtless thou sayest sooth; yet I wot not that I\nam come forth to seek a master.\"\n\nSaid the brother:  \"Nay, do but see the lord Abbot, as thou mayst do\nto-morrow, if thou wilt.\"\n\n\"I would have his blessing,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"No less shalt thou have,\" said the brother; \"but look you down yonder;\nfor I can see tokens that my lord is even now coming forth.\"\n\nRalph looked down and beheld the folk parting to right and left, and a\nlane made amidst the throng, guarded by men-at-arms mingled with the\ncross-bearers and brethren; and the sound of trumpets blared forth over\nthe noises of the throng.\n\n\"If the lord Abbot cometh,\" said Ralph, \"I were fain of his blessing\nto-night before I sleep:  so go we down straightway that I may kneel\nbefore him with the rest.\"\n\n\"What!\" said the monk, \"Wilt thou, my lord, kneel amongst all these\nburgesses and vavassors when thou mightest see the Abbot in his own\nchamber face to face alone with him?\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Ralph, \"I am no great man, and I must needs depart\nbetimes to-morrow; for I perceive that here are things too mighty and\nover-mastering for such as I be.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the monk, \"yet mayst thou come back again; so at present I\nwill make no more words about it.\"\n\nSo they went down, and came out amidst the throng, above which the bale\nstill flared high, making the summer night as light as day.  The\nbrother made way for Ralph, so that they stood in the front row of\nfolk:  they had not been there one minute ere they heard the sound of\nthe brethren singing, and the Abbot came forth out of the lane that\nwent down to the gate.  Then all folk went down upon their knees, and\nthus abode him.  Right so Ralph deemed that he felt some one pull his\nsleeve, but in such a throng that was nought of a wonder; howbeit, he\nturned and looked to his left, whence came the tug, and saw kneeling\nbeside him a tall man-at-arms, who bore a sallet on his head in such\nwise that it covered all his face save the point of his chin.  Then\nRalph bethought him of the man of the leafless tree, and he looked to\nsee what armoury the man bore on his coat; but he had nothing save a\nloose frock of white linen over his hauberk.  Nevertheless, he heard a\nvoice in his ear, which said, \"The second time!\" whereon he deemed that\nit was verily that same man:  yet had he nought to do to lay hold on\nhim, and he might not speak with him, for even therewith came the Abbot\nin garments all of gold, going a-foot under a canopy of baudekyn, with\nthe precious mitre on his head, and the crozier borne before him, as if\nhe had been a patriarch: for he was an exceeding mighty lord.\n\nRalph looked hard on him as he passed by, blessing the folk with\nupraised hand; and he saw that he was a tall spare man, clean-shaven,\nand thin-faced; but no old man, belike scarce of fifty winters.  Ralph\ncaught his eye, and he smiled on the goodly young man so kindly, that\nfor a moment Ralph deemed that he would dwell in St. Mary's House for a\nlittle while; for, thought he, if my father, or Nicholas, hear of me\ntherein, they must even let me alone to abide here.\n\nTherewith the Abbot went forth to his place, and sat him down under a\ngoodly cloth of estate, and folk stood up again; but when Ralph looked\nfor the man in the sallet he could see nought of him.  Now when the\nAbbot was set down, men made a clear ring round about the bale, and\nthere came into the said ring twelve young men, each clad in nought\nsave a goat-skin, and with garlands of leaves and flowers about their\nmiddles: they had with them a wheel done about with straw and hemp\npayed with pitch and brimstone.  They set fire to the same, and then\ntrundled it blazing round about the bale twelve times.  Then came to\nthem twelve damsels clad in such-like guise as the young men:  then\nboth bands, the young men and the maidens, drew near to the bale, which\nwas now burning low, and stood about it, and joined hands, and so\ndanced round it a while, and meantime the fiddles played an uncouth\ntune merrily: then they sundered, and each couple of men and maids\nleapt backward and forward over the fire; and when they had all leapt,\ncame forward men with buckets of water which they cast over the dancers\ntill it ran down them in streams.  Then was all the throng mingled\ntogether, and folk trod the embers of the bale under foot, and\nscattered them hither and thither all over the square.\n\nAll this while men were going about with pitchers of wine and ale, and\nother good drinks; and every man drank freely what he would, and there\nwas the greatest game and joyance.\n\nBut now was Ralph exceeding weary, and he said:  \"Father, mightest thou\nlead me out of this throng, and show me some lair where I may sleep in\npeace, I would thank thee blithely.\"\n\nAs he spake there sounded a great horn over the square, and the Abbot\nrose in his place and blessed all the people once more.  Then said the\nmonk:\n\n\"Come then, fair field-lord, now shalt thou have thy will of bed.\" And\nhe laughed therewith, and drew Ralph out of the throng and brought him\ninto the Abbey, and into a fair little chamber, on the wall whereof was\npictured St. Christopher, and St. Julian the lord and friend of\nwayfarers.  Then he brought Ralph the wine and spices, and gave him\ngood-night, and went his ways.\n\nAs Ralph put the raiment from off him he said to himself a long day\nforsooth, so long that I should have thought no day could have held all\nthat has befallen me.  So many strange things have I seen, that surely\nmy dreams shall be full of them; for even now I seem to see them,\nthough I waken.\n\nSo he lay down in his bed and slept, and dreamed that he was fishing\nwith an angle in a deep of Upmeads Water; and he caught many fish; but\nafter a while whatsoever he caught was but of gilded paper stuffed with\nwool, and at last the water itself was gone, and he was casting his\nangle on to a dry road.  Therewith he awoke and saw that day was\ndawning, and heard the minster clock strike three, and heard the\nthrushes singing their first song in the Prior's garden.  Then he\nturned about and slept, and dreamed no more till he woke up in the\nbright sunny morning.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nRalph Goeth His Ways From the Abbey of St. Mary at Higham\n\n\nIt was the monk who had been his guide the day before who had now waked\nhim, and he stood by the bedside holding a great bowl of milk in his\nhand, and as Ralph sat up, and rubbed his eyes, with all his youthful\nsloth upon him, the monk laughed and said:\n\n\"That is well, lord, that is well!  I love to see a young man so sleepy\nin the morning; it is a sign of thriving; and I see thou art thriving\nheartily for the time when thou shalt come back to us to lead my lord's\nhost in battle.\"\n\n\"Where be the bale-fires?\" said Ralph, not yet fully awake.\n\n\"Where be they!\" said the brother, \"where be they!  They be sunken to\ncold coals long ago, like many a man's desires and hopes, who hath not\nyet laid his head on the bosom of the mother, that is Holy Church.\nCome, my lord, arise, and drink the monk's wine of morning, and then if\nye must need ride, ride betimes, and ride hard; for the Wood Perilous\nbeginneth presently as ye wend your ways; and it were well for thee to\nreach the Burg of the Four Friths ere thou be benighted.  For, son,\nthere be untoward things in the wood; and though some of them be of\nthose for whom Christ's Cross was shapen, yet have they forgotten hell,\nand hope not for heaven, and their by-word is, 'Thou shalt lack ere I\nlack.' Furthermore there are worse wights in the wood than they be--\nGod save us!--but against them have I a good hauberk, a neck-guard\nwhich I will give thee, son, in token that I look to see thee again at\nthe lovely house of Mary our Mother.\"\n\nRalph had taken the bowl and was drinking, but he looked over the brim,\nand saw how the monk drew from his frock a pair of beads, as like to\nDame Katherine's gift as one pea to another, save that at the end\nthereof was a little box shapen crosswise.  Ralph emptied the bowl\nhastily, got out of bed, and sat on the bed naked, save that on his\nneck was Dame Katherine's gift.  He reached out his hand and took the\nbeads from the monk and reddened therewith, as was his wont when he had\nto begin a contest in words: but he said:\n\n\"I thank thee, father; yet God wot if these beads will lie sweetly\nalongside the collar which I bear on my neck as now, which is the gift\nof a dear friend.\"\n\nThe monk made up a solemn countenance and said: \"Thou sayest sooth, my\nson; it is most like that my chaplet, which hath been blessed time was\nby the holy Richard, is no meet fellow for the gift of some light love\nof thine: or even,\" quoth he, noting Ralph's flush deepen, and his brow\nknit, \"or even if it were the gift of a well-willer, yet belike it is a\nworldly gift; therefore, since thy journey is with peril, thou wert\nbest do it off and let me keep it for thee till thou comest again.\"\n\nNow as he spake he looked anxiously, nay, it may be said greedily, at\nthe young man.  But Ralph said nought; for in his heart he was\ndetermined not to chaffer away his gossip's gift for any shaveling's\ntoken.  Yet he knew not how to set his youthful words against the\nfather's wisdom; so he stood up, and got his shirt into his hand, and\nas he did it over his head he fell to singing to himself a song of\neventide of the High House of Upmeads, the words whereof were somewhat\nlike to these:\n\n\n  Art thou man, art thou maid, through the long grass a-going?\n    For short shirt thou bearest, and no beard I see,\n  And the last wind ere moonrise about thee is blowing.\n    Would'st thou meet with thy maiden or look'st thou for me?\n\n  Bright shineth the moon now, I see thy gown longer;\n    And down by the hazels Joan meeteth her lad:\n  But hard is thy palm, lass, and scarcely were stronger\n    Wat's grip than thine hand-kiss that maketh me glad.\n\n  And now as the candles shine on us and over,\n    Full shapely thy feet are, but brown on the floor,\n  As the bare-footed mowers amidst of the clover\n    When the gowk's note is broken and mid-June is o'er.\n\n  O hard are mine hand-palms because on the ridges\n    I carried the reap-hook and smote for thy sake;\n  And in the hot noon-tide I beat off the midges\n    As thou slep'st 'neath the linden o'er-loathe to awake.\n\n  And brown are my feet now because the sun burneth\n    High up on the down-side amidst of the sheep,\n  And there in the hollow wherefrom the wind turneth,\n    Thou lay'st in my lap while I sung thee to sleep.\n\n  O friend of the earth, O come nigher and nigher,\n    Thou art sweet with the sun's kiss as meads of the May,\n  O'er the rocks of the waste, o'er the water and fire,\n    Will I follow thee, love, till earth waneth away.\n\n\nThe monk hearkened to him with knitted brow, and as one that liketh not\nthe speech of his fellow, though it be not wise to question it: then he\nwent out of the chamber, but left the pair of beads lying in the\nwindow.  But Ralph clad himself in haste, and when he was fully clad,\nwent up to the window and took the beads in his hand, and looked into\nthem curiously and turned them over, but left them lying there.  Then\nhe went forth also, and came into the forecourt of the house, and found\nthere a squire of the men-at-arms with his weapons and horse, who\nhelped him to do on his war-gear.\n\nSo then, just as he was setting his foot in the stirrup, came the\nBrother again, with his face once more grown smiling and happy; and in\nhis left hand he held the chaplet, but did not offer it to Ralph again,\nbut nodded his head to him kindly, and said: \"Now, lord, I can see by\nthy face that thou art set on beholding the fashion of this world, and\nmost like it will give thee the rue.\"\n\nThen came a word into Ralph's mouth, and he said: \"Wilt thou tell me,\nfather, whose work was the world's fashion?\"\n\nThe monk reddened, but answered nought, and Ralph spake again:\n\n\"Forsooth, did the craftsman of it fumble over his work?\"\n\nThen the monk scowled, but presently he enforced himself to speak\nblithely, and said:  \"Such matters are over high for my speech or\nthine, lord; but I tell thee, who knoweth, that there are men in this\nHouse who have tried the world and found it wanting.\"\n\nRalph smiled, and said stammering:\n\n\"Father, did the world try them, and find them wanting perchance?\"\n\nThen he reddened, and said:  \"Are ye verily all such as this in this\nHouse?  Who then is it who hath made so fair a lordship, and so goodly\na governance for so many people?  Know ye not at all of the world's\nways!\"\n\n\"Fair sir,\" said the monk sternly, \"they that work for us work for the\nLord and all his servants.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"so it is; and will the Lord be content with the\nservice of him whom the devil hath cast out because he hath found him a\ndastard?\"\n\nThe monk frowned, yet smiled somewhat withal, and said: \"Sir, thou art\nyoung, but thy wits are over old for me; but there are they in this\nHouse who may answer thee featly; men who have read the books of the\nwise men of the heathen, and the doctors of Holy Church, and are even\nnow making books for the scribes to copy.\"  Then his voice softened,\nand he said: \"Dear lord, we should be right fain of thee here, but\nsince thou must needs go, go with my blessing, and double blessing\nshalt thou have when thou comest back to us.\"  Then Ralph remembered\nhis promise to the shepherds and took a gold crown from his pouch, and\nsaid: \"Father, I pray thee say a mass for the shepherd downsmen; and\nthis is for the offering.\"\n\nThe monk praised the gift and the bidding, and kissed Ralph, who clomb\ninto his saddle; and the brother hospitalier brought him his wallet\nwith good meat and drink therein for the way.  Then Ralph shook his\nrein, and rode out of the abbey-gate, smiling at the lay-brethren and\nthe men-at-arms who hung about there.\n\nBut he sighed for pleasure when he found himself in the street again,\nand looked on the shops of the chapmen and the booths of the petty\ncraftsmen, as shoe-smiths and glovers, and tinsmiths and coppersmiths,\nand horners and the like; and the folk that he met as he rode toward\nthe southern gate seemed to him merry and in good case, and goodly to\nlook on.  And he thought it pleasant to gaze on the damsels in the\nstreet, who were fair and well clad:  and there were a many of them\nabout his way now, especially as he drew nigh the gate before the\nstreets branched off: for folk were coming in from the countryside with\nvictual and other wares for the town and the Abbey; and surely as he\nlooked on some of the maidens he deemed that Hall-song of Upmeads a\ngood one.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nThe Maiden of Bourton Abbas\n\n\nSo went he through the gate, and many, both of men and maids gazed at\nhim, for he was fair to look on, but none meddled with him.\n\nThere was a goodly fauburg outside the gate, and therein were fair\nhouses, not a few, with gardens and orchards about them; and when these\nwere past he rode through very excellent meadows lying along the water,\nwhich he crossed thrice, once by a goodly stone bridge and twice by\nfords; for the road was straight, and the river wound about much.\n\nAfter a little while the road led him off the plain meads into a\ncountry of little hills and dales, the hill-sides covered with\nvineyards and orchards, and the dales plenteous of corn-fields; and now\namongst these dales Higham was hidden from him.\n\nThrough this tillage and vine-land he rode a good while, and thought he\nhad never seen a goodlier land; and as he went he came on husbandmen\nand women of the country going about their business: yet were they not\ntoo busy to gaze on him, and most greeted him; and with some he gave\nand took a little speech.\n\nThese people also he deemed well before the world, for they were well\nclad and buxom, and made no great haste as they went, but looked about\nthem as though they deemed the world worth looking at, and as if they\nhad no fear either of a blow or a hard word for loitering.\n\nSo he rode till it was noon, and he was amidst a little thorp of grey\nstone houses, trim enough, in a valley wherein there was more of\nwild-wood trees and less of fruit-bearers than those behind him.  In\nthe thorp was a tavern with the sign of the Nicholas, so Ralph deemed\nit but right to enter a house which was under the guard of his master\nand friend; therefore he lighted down and went in.  Therein he found a\nlad of fifteen winters, and a maiden spinning, they two alone, who\nhailed him and asked his pleasure, and he bade them bring him meat and\ndrink, and look to his horse, for that he had a mind to rest a while.\nSo they brought him bread and flesh, and good wine of the hill-side, in\na little hall well arrayed as of its kind; and he sat down and the\ndamsel served him at table, but the lad, who had gone to see to his\nhorse, did not come back.\n\nSo when he had eaten and drunk, and the damsel was still there, he\nlooked on her and saw that she was sad and drooping of aspect; and\nwhereas she was a fair maiden, Ralph, now that he was full, fell to\npitying her, and asked her what was amiss.  \"For,\" said he, \"thou art\nfair and ailest nought; that is clear to see; neither dwellest thou in\npenury, but by seeming hast enough and to spare.  Or art thou a servant\nin this house, and hath any one misused thee?\"\n\nShe wept at his words, for indeed he spoke softly to her; then she\nsaid:  \"Young lord, thou art kind, and it is thy kindness that draweth\nthe tears from me; else it were not well to weep before a young man:\ntherefore I pray thee pardon me.  As for me, I am no servant, nor has\nany one misused me: the folk round about are good and neighbourly; and\nthis house and the croft, and a vineyard hard by, all that is mine own\nand my brother's; that is the lad who hath gone to tend thine horse.\nYea, and we live in peace here for the most part; for this thorp, which\nis called Bourton Abbas, is a land of the Abbey of Higham; though it be\nthe outermost of its lands and the Abbot is a good lord and a defence\nagainst tyrants.  All is well with me if one thing were not.\"\n\n\"What is thy need then?\" said Ralph, \"if perchance I might amend it.\"\nAnd as he looked on her he deemed her yet fairer than he had done at\nfirst.  But she stayed her weeping and sobbing and said:  \"Sir, I fear\nme that I have lost a dear friend.\"  \"How then,\" said he, \"why fearest\nthou, and knowest not? doth thy friend lie sick between life and\ndeath?\" \"O Sir,\" she said, \"it is the Wood which is the evil and\ndisease.\"\n\n\"What wood is that?\" said he.\n\nShe said:  \"The Wood Perilous, that lieth betwixt us and the Burg of\nthe Four Friths, and all about the Burg.  And, Sir, if ye be minded to\nride to the Burg to-day, do it not, for through the wood must thou wend\nthereto; and ye are young and lovely.  Therefore take my rede, and\nabide till the Chapmen wend thither from Higham, who ride many in\ncompany.  For, look you, fair lord, ye have asked of my grief, and this\nit is and nought else; that my very earthly love and speech-friend rode\nfive days ago toward the Burg of the Four Friths all alone through the\nWood Perilous, and he has not come back, though we looked to see him in\nthree days' wearing:  but his horse has come back, and the reins and\nthe saddle all bloody.\"\n\nAnd she fell a-weeping with the telling of the tale.  But Ralph said\n(for he knew not what to say): \"Keep a good heart, maiden; maybe he is\nsafe and sound; oft are young men fond to wander wide, even as I\nmyself.\"\n\nShe looked at him hard and said:  \"If thou hast stolen thyself away\nfrom them that love thee, thou hast done amiss.  Though thou art a\nlord, and so fair as I see thee, yet will I tell thee so much.\"\n\nRalph reddened and answered nought; but deemed the maiden both fair and\nsweet.  But she said:  \"Whether thou hast done well or ill, do no\nworse; but abide till the Chapmen come from Higham, on their way to the\nBurg of the Four Friths.  Here mayst thou lodge well and safely if thou\nwilt.  Or if our hall be not dainty enough for thee, then go back to\nHigham: I warrant me the monks will give thee good guesting as long as\nthou wilt.\"\n\n\"Thou art kind, maiden,\" said Ralph, \"but why should I tarry for an\nhost? and what should I fear in the Wood, as evil as it may be?  One\nman journeying with little wealth, and unknown, and he no weakling, but\nbearing good weapons, hath nought to dread of strong-thieves, who ever\nrob where it is easiest and gainfullest.  And what worse may I meet\nthan strong-thieves?\"\n\n\"But thou mayest meet worse,\" she said; and therewith fell a-weeping\nagain, and said amidst her tears:  \"O weary on my life!  And why should\nI heed thee when nought heedeth me, neither the Saints of God's House,\nnor the Master of it; nor the father and the mother that were once so\npiteous kind to me?  O if I might but drink a draught from the WELL AT\nTHE WORLD'S END!\"\n\nHe turned about on her hastily at that word; for he had risen to\ndepart; being grieved at her grief and wishful to be away from it,\nsince he might not amend it.  But now he said eagerly:\n\n\"Where then is that Well?  Know ye of it in this land?\"\n\n\"At least I know the hearsay thereof,\" she said; \"but as now thou shalt\nknow no more from me thereof; lest thou wander the wider in seeking it.\nI would not have thy life spilt.\"\n\nEver as he looked on her he thought her still fairer; and now he looked\nlong on her, saying nought, and she on him in likewise, and the blood\nrose to her cheeks and her brow, but she would not turn her from his\ngaze.  At last he said: \"Well then, I must depart, no more learned than\nI came: but yet am I less hungry and thirsty than I came; and have thou\nthanks therefor.\"\n\nTherewith he took from his pouch a gold piece of Upmeads, which was\ngood, and of the touch of the Easterlings, and held it out to her.  And\nshe put out her open hand and he put the money in it; but thought it\ngood to hold her hand a while, and she gainsayed him not.\n\nThen he said:  \"Well then, I must needs depart with things left as they\nare: wilt thou bid thy brother bring hither my horse, for time presses.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said (and her hand was still in his), \"Yet do thine utmost,\nyet shalt thou not get to the Burg before nightfall.  O wilt thou not\ntarry?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" he said, \"my heart will not suffer it; lest I deem myself a\ndastard.\"\n\nThen she reddened again, but as if she were wroth; and she drew her\nhand away from his and smote her palms together thrice and cried out:\n\"Ho Hugh! bring hither the Knight's horse and be speedy!\"\n\nAnd she went hither and thither about the hall and into the buttery and\nback, putting away the victual and vessels from the board and making as\nif she heeded him not:  and Ralph looked on her, and deemed that each\nway she moved was better than the last, so shapely of fashion she was;\nand again he bethought him of the Even-song of the High House at\nUpmeads, and how it befitted her; for she went barefoot after the\nmanner of maidens who work afield, and her feet were tanned with the\nsun of hay harvest, but as shapely as might be; but she was clad goodly\nwithal, in a green gown wrought with flowers.\n\nSo he watched her going to and fro; and at last he said: \"Maiden, wilt\nthou come hither a little, before I depart?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said; and came and stood before him: and he deemed that she\nwas scarce so sad as she had been; and she stood with her hands joined\nand her eyes downcast.  Then he said:\n\n\"Now I depart.  Yet I would say this, that I am sorry of thy sorrow:\nand now since I shall never see thee more, small would be the harm if I\nwere to kiss thy lips and thy face.\"\n\nAnd therewith he took her hands in his and drew her to him, and put his\narms about her and kissed her many times, and she nothing lothe by\nseeming; and he found her as sweet as May blossom.\n\nThereafter she smiled on him, yet scarce for gladness, and said: \"It is\nnot all so sure that I shall not see thee again; yet shall I do to thee\nas thou hast done to me.\"\n\nTherewith she took his face between her hands, and kissed him\nwell-favouredly; so that the hour seemed good to him.\n\nThen she took him by the hand and led him out-a-doors to his horse,\nwhereby the lad had been standing a good while; and he when he saw his\nsister come out with the fair knight he scowled on them, and handled a\nknife which hung at his girdle; but Ralph heeded him nought.  As for\nthe damsel, she put her brother aside, and held the stirrup for Ralph;\nand when he was in the saddle she said to him:\n\n\"All luck go with thee!  Forsooth I deem thee safer in the Wood than my\nwords said.  Verily I deem that if thou wert to meet a company of\nfoemen, thou wouldest compel them to do thy bidding.\"\n\n\"Farewell to thee maiden,\" said Ralph, \"and mayst thou find thy beloved\nwhole and well, and that speedily.  Fare-well!\"\n\nShe said no more; so he shook his rein and rode his ways; but looked\nover his shoulder presently and saw her standing yet barefoot on the\ndusty highway shading her eyes from the afternoon sun and looking after\nhim, and he waved his hand to her and so went his ways between the\nhouses of the Thorp.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nRalph Cometh to the Wood Perilous.  An Adventure Therein\n\n\nNow when he was clear of the Thorp the road took him out of the dale;\nand when he was on the hill's brow he saw that the land was of other\nfashion from that which lay behind him.  For the road went straight\nthrough a rough waste, no pasture, save for mountain sheep or goats,\nwith a few bushes scattered about it; and beyond this the land rose\ninto a long ridge; and on the ridge was a wood thick with trees, and no\nbreak in them.  So on he rode, and soon passed that waste, which was\ndry and parched, and the afternoon sun was hot on it; so he deemed it\ngood to come under the shadow of the thick trees (which at the first\nwere wholly beech trees), for it was now the hottest of the day.  There\nwas still a beaten way between the tree-boles, though not overwide,\nalbeit, a highway, since it pierced the wood.  So thereby he went at a\nsoft pace for the saving of his horse, and thought but little of all he\nhad been told of the perils of the way, and not a little of the fair\nmaid whom he had left behind at the Thorp.\n\nAfter a while the thick beech-wood gave out, and he came into a place\nwhere great oaks grew, fair and stately, as though some lord's\nwood-reeve had taken care that they should not grow over close\ntogether, and betwixt them the greensward was fine, unbroken, and\nflowery.  Thereby as he rode he beheld deer, both buck and hart and\nroe, and other wild things, but for a long while no man.\n\nThe afternoon wore and still he rode the oak wood, and deemed it a\ngoodly forest for the greatest king on earth.  At last he came to where\nanother road crossed the way he followed, and about the crossway was\nthe ground clearer of trees, while beyond it the trees grew thicker,\nand there was some underwood of holly and thorn as the ground fell off\nas towards a little dale.\n\nThere Ralph drew rein, because he doubted in his mind which was his\nright road toward the Burg of the Four Friths; so he got off his horse\nand abode a little, if perchance any might come by; he looked about\nhim, and noted on the road that crossed his, and the sward about it,\nthe sign of many horses having gone by, and deemed that they had passed\nbut a little while.  So he lay on the ground to rest him and let his\nhorse stray about and bite the grass; for the beast loved him and would\ncome at his call or his whistle.\n\nRalph was drowsy when he lay down, and though he said to himself that\nhe would nowise go to sleep, yet as oft happens, he had no defence to\nmake against sleepiness, and presently his hands relaxed, his head fell\naside, and he slept quietly.  When he woke up in a little space of\ntime, he knew at once that something had awaked him and that he had not\nhad his sleep out; for in his ears was the trampling of horse-hoofs and\nthe clashing of weapons and loud speech of men.  So he leapt up\nhastily, and while he was yet scarce awake, took to whistling on his\nhorse; but even therewith those men were upon him, and two came up to\nhim and laid hold of him; and when he asked them what they would, they\nbade him hold his peace.\n\nNow his eyes cleared, and he saw that those men were in goodly\nwar-gear, and bore coats of plate, and cuir-bouilly, or of bright\nsteel; they held long spears and were girt with good swords; there was\na pennon with them, green, whereon was done a golden tower, embattled,\namidst of four white ways; and the same token bore many of the men on\ntheir coats and sleeves.  Unto this same pennon he was brought by the\ntwo men who had taken him, and under it, on a white horse, sat a Knight\nbravely armed at all points with the Tower and Four Ways on his green\nsurcoat; and beside him was an ancient man-at-arms, with nought but an\noak wreath on his bare head, and his white beard falling low over his\ncoat:  but behind these twain a tall young man, also on a white horse\nand very gaily clad, upheld the pennon.  On one side of these three\nwere five men, unarmed, clad in green coats, with a leafless tree done\non them in gold:  they were stout carles, bearded and fierce-faced:\ntheir hands were bound behind their backs and their feet tied together\nunder their horses' bellies.  The company of those about the Knight,\nRalph deemed, would number ten score men.\n\nSo when those twain stayed Ralph before the Knight, he turned to the\nold man and said:\n\n\"It is of no avail asking this lither lad if he be of them or no: for\nno will be his answer.  But what sayest thou, Oliver?\"\n\nThe ancient man drew closer to Ralph and looked at him up and down and\nall about; for those two turned him about as if he had been a joint of\nflesh on the roasting-jack; and at last he said:\n\n\"His beard is sprouting, else might ye have taken him for a maid of\ntheirs, one of those of whom we wot.  But to say sooth I seem to know\nthe fashion of his gear, even as Duke Jacob knew Joseph's tabard.  So\nask him whence he is, lord, and if he lie, then I bid bind him and lead\nhim away, that we may have a true tale out of him; otherwise let him go\nand take his chance; for we will not waste the bread of the Good Town\non him.\"\n\nThe Knight looked hard on Ralph, and spake to him somewhat courteously:\n\n\"Whence art thou, fair Sir, and what is thy name? for we have many foes\nin the wildwood.\"\n\nRalph reddened as he answered:  \"I am of Upmeads beyond the down\ncountry; and I pray thee let me be gone on mine errands.  It is meet\nthat thou deal with thine own robbers and reivers, but not with me.\"\n\nThen cried out one of the bounden men:  \"Thou liest, lad, we be no\nrobbers.\" But he of the Knight's company who stood by him smote the man\non the mouth and said:  \"Hold thy peace, runagate!  Thou shalt give\ntongue to-morrow when the hangman hath thee under his hands.\"\n\nThe Knight took no heed of this; but turned to the ancient warrior and\nsaid: \"Hath he spoken truth so far?\"\n\n\"Yea, Sir Aymer,\" quoth Oliver; \"And now meseems I know him better than\nhe knoweth me.\"\n\nTherewith he turned to Ralph and said:  \"How fareth Long Nicholas, my\nlord?\"\n\nRalph reddened again:  \"He is well,\" said he.\n\nThen said the Knight:  \"Is the young man of a worthy house, Oliver?\"\n\nBut ere the elder could speak, Ralph brake in and said: \"Old warrior, I\nbid thee not to tell out my name, as thou lovest Nicholas.\"\n\nOld Oliver laughed and said:  \"Well, Nicholas and I have been friends\nin a way, as well as foes; and for the sake of the old days his name\nshall help thee, young lord.\" Then he said to his Knight:  \"Yea, Sir\nAymer, he is of a goodly house and an ancient; but thou hearest how he\nadjureth me.  Ye shall let his name alone.\"\n\nThe Knight looked silently on Ralph for a while; then he said: \"Wilt\nthou wend with us to the Burg of the Four Friths, fair Sir?  Wert thou\nnot faring thither?  Or what else dost thou in the Wood Perilous?\"\n\nRalph turned it over in his mind; and though he saw no cause why he\nshould not join himself to their company, yet something in his heart\nforbade him to rise to the fly too eagerly; so he did but say: \"I am\nseeking adventures, fair lord.\"\n\nThe Knight smiled:  \"Then mayst thou fill thy budget with them if thou\ngoest with us,\" quoth he.  Now Ralph did not know how he might gainsay\nso many men at arms in the long run, though he were scarce willing to\ngo; so he made no haste to answer; and even therewith came a man\nrunning, through the wood up from the dale; a long, lean carle, meet\nfor running, with brogues on his feet, and nought else but a shirt; the\ncompany parted before him to right and left to let him come to the\nKnight, as though he had been looked for; and when he was beside him,\nthe Knight leaned down while the carle spake softly to him and all men\ndrew out of ear-shot.  And when the carle had given his message the\nKnight drew himself straight up in his saddle again and lifted up his\nhand and cried out:\n\n\"Oliver!  Oliver! lead on the way thou wottest!  Spur! spur, all men!\"\n\nTherewith he blew one blast from a horn which hung at his saddle-bow;\nthe runner leapt up behind old Oliver, and the whole company went off\nat a smart trot somewhat south-east, slantwise of the cross-roads,\nwhere the wood was nought cumbered with undergrowth; and presently they\nwere all gone to the last horse-tail, and no man took any more note of\nRalph.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nAnother Adventure in the Wood Perilous\n\n\nRalph left alone pondered a little; and thought that he would by no\nmeans go hastily to the Burg of the Four Friths.  Said he to himself;\nThis want-way is all unlike to the one near our house at home:  for\nbelike adventures shall befall here: I will even abide here for an hour\nor two; but will have my horse by me and keep awake, lest something hap\nto me unawares.\n\nTherewith he whistled for Falcon his horse, and the beast came to him,\nand whinnied for love of him, and Ralph smiled and tied him to a\nsapling anigh, and himself sat down on the grass, and pondered many\nthings; as to what folk were about at Upmeads, and how his brethren\nwere faring; and it was now about five hours after noon, and the sun's\nrays fell aslant through the boughs of the noble oaks, and the scent of\nthe grass and bracken trodden by the horse-hoofs of that company went\nup into the warm summer air.  A while he sat musing but awake, though\nthe faint sound of a little stream in the dale below mingled with all\nthe lesser noises of the forest did its best to soothe him to sleep\nagain:  and presently had its way with him; for he leaned his head back\non the bracken, and in a minute or two was sleeping once more and\ndreaming some dream made up of masterless memories of past days.\n\nWhen he awoke again he lay still a little while, wondering where in the\nworld he was, but as the drowsiness left him, he arose and looked\nabout, and saw that the sun was sinking low and gilding the oakboles\nred.  He stood awhile and watched the gambols of three hares, who had\ndrawn nigh him while he slept, and now noted him not; and a little way\nhe saw through the trees a hart and two hinds going slowly from grass\nto grass, feeding in the cool eventide; but presently he saw them raise\ntheir heads and amble off down the slope of the little dale, and\ntherewith he himself turned his face sharply toward the north-west, for\nhe was fine-eared as well as sharp-eyed, and on a little wind which had\njust arisen came down to him the sound of horse-hoofs once more.\n\nSo he went up to Falcon and loosed him, and stood by him bridle in\nhand, and looked to it that his sword was handy to him: and he\nhearkened, and the sound drew nigher and nigher to him.  Then lightly\nhe got into the saddle and gathered the reins into his left hand, and\nsat peering up the trodden wood-glades, lest he should have to ride for\nhis life suddenly.  Therewith he heard voices talking roughly and a man\nwhistling, and athwart the glade of the wood from the northwest, or\nthereabout, came new folk; and he saw at once that there went two men\na-horseback and armed; so he drew his sword and abode them close to the\nwant-ways. Presently they saw the shine of his war-gear, and then they\ncame but a little nigher ere they drew rein, and sat on their horses\nlooking toward him.  Then Ralph saw that they were armed and clad as\nthose of the company which had gone before.  One of the armed men rode\na horse-length after his fellow, and bore a long spear over his\nshoulder.  But the other who rode first was girt with a sword, and had\na little axe hanging about his neck, and with his right hand he seemed\nto be leading something, Ralph could not see what at first, as his left\nside was turned toward Ralph and the want-way.\n\nNow, as Ralph looked, he saw that at the spearman's saddle-bow was hung\na man's head, red-haired and red-bearded; for this man now drew a\nlittle nigher, and cried out to Ralph in a loud and merry voice: \"Hail,\nknight! whither away now, that thou ridest the green-wood sword in\nhand?\"\n\nRalph was just about to answer somewhat, when the first man moved a\nlittle nigher, and as he did so he turned so that Ralph could see what\nbetid on his right hand; and lo! he was leading a woman by a rope tied\nabout her neck (though her hands were loose), as though he were\nbringing a cow to market.  When the man stayed his horse she came\nforward and stood within the slack of the rope by the horse's head, and\nRalph could see her well, that though she was not to say naked, her\nraiment was but scanty, for she had nought to cover her save one short\nand strait little coat of linen, and shoes on her feet.  Yet Ralph\ndeemed her to be of some degree, whereas he caught the gleam of gold\nand gems on her hands, and there was a golden chaplet on her head.  She\nstood now by the horse's head with her hands folded, looking on, as if\nwhat was tiding and to betide, were but a play done for her pleasure.\n\nSo when Ralph looked on her, he was silent a while; and the spearman\ncried out again:  \"Ho, young man, wilt thou speak, or art thou\ndumb-foundered for fear of us?\"\n\nBut Ralph knit his brows, and was first red and then pale; for he was\nboth wroth, and doubtful how to go to work; but he said:\n\n\"I ride to seek adventures; and here meseemeth is one come to hand.  Or\nwhat will ye with the woman?\"\n\nSaid the man who had the woman in tow:  \"Trouble not thine head\ntherewith; we lead her to her due doom.  As for thee, be glad that thou\nart not her fellow; since forsooth thou seemest not to be one of them;\nso go thy ways in peace.\"\n\n\"No foot further will I go,\" said Ralph, \"till ye loose the woman and\nlet her go; or else tell me what her worst deed is.\"\n\nThe man laughed, and said:  \"That were a long tale to tell; and it is\nlittle like that thou shalt live to hear the ending thereof.\"\n\nTherewith he wagged his head at the spearman, who suddenly let his\nspear fall into the rest, and spurred, and drave on at Ralph all he\nmight.  There and then had the tale ended, but Ralph, who was wary,\nthough he were young, and had Falcon well in hand, turned his wrist and\nmade the horse swerve, so that the man-at-arms missed his attaint, but\ncould not draw rein speedily enough to stay his horse; and as he passed\nby all bowed over his horse's neck, Ralph gat his sword two-handed and\nrose in his stirrups and smote his mightiest; and the sword caught the\nfoeman on the neck betwixt sallet and jack, and nought held before it,\nneither leather nor ring-mail, so that the man's head was nigh smitten\noff, and he fell clattering from his saddle: yet his stirrups held him,\nso that his horse went dragging him on earth as he gallopped over rough\nand smooth betwixt the trees of the forest.  Then Ralph turned about to\ndeal with his fellow, and even through the wrath and fury of the\nslaying saw him clear and bright against the trees as he sat handling\nhis axe doubtfully, but the woman was fallen back again somewhat.\n\nBut even as Ralph raised his sword and pricked forward, the woman\nsprang as light as a leopard on to the saddle behind the foeman, and\nwound her arms about him and dragged him back just as he was raising\nhis axe to smite her, and as Ralph rode forward she cried out to him,\n\"Smite him, smite!  O lovely creature of God!\"\n\nTherewith was Ralph beside them, and though he were loth to slay a man\nheld in the arms of a woman, yet he feared lest the man should slay her\nwith some knife-stroke unless he made haste; so he thrust his sword\nthrough him, and the man died at once, and fell headlong off his horse,\ndragging down the woman with him.\n\nThen Ralph lighted down from his horse, and the woman rose up to him,\nher white smock all bloody with the slain man.  Nevertheless was she as\ncalm and stately before him, as if she were sitting on the dais of a\nfair hall; so she said to him:\n\n\"Young warrior, thou hast done well and knightly, and I shall look to\nit that thou have thy reward.  And now I rede thee go not to the Burg\nof the Four Friths; for this tale of thee shall get about and they\nshall take thee, if it were out of the very Frith-stool, and there for\nthee should be the scourge and the gibbet; for they of that Burg be\nrobbers and murderers merciless.  Yet well it were that thou ride hence\npresently; for those be behind my tormentors whom thou hast slain, who\nwill be as an host to thee, and thou mayst not deal with them.  If thou\nfollow my rede, thou wilt take the way that goeth hence east away, and\nthen shalt thou come to Hampton under Scaur, where the folk are\npeaceable and friendly.\"\n\nHe looked at her hard as she spake, and noted that she spake but\nslowly, and turned red and white and red again as she looked at him.\nBut whatever she did, and in spite of her poor attire, he deemed he had\nnever seen woman so fair.  Her hair was dark red, but her eyes grey,\nand light at whiles and yet at whiles deep; her lips betwixt thin and\nfull, but yet when she spoke or smiled clad with all enticements; her\nchin round and so wrought as none was ever better wrought; her body\nstrong and well-knit; tall she was, with fair and large arms, and limbs\nmost goodly of fashion, of which but little was hidden, since her coat\nwas but thin and scanty.  But whatever may be said of her, no man would\nhave deemed her aught save most lovely.  Now her face grew calm and\nstately again as it was at the first, and she laid a hand on Ralph's\nshoulder, and smiled in his face and said:\n\n\"Surely thou art fair, though thy strokes be not light.\" Then she took\nhis hand and caressed it, and said again: \"Dost thou deem that thou\nhast done great things, fair child?  Maybe.  Yet some will say that\nthou hast but slain two butchers:  and if thou wilt say that thou hast\ndelivered me; yet it may be that I should have delivered myself ere\nlong.  Nevertheless hold up thine heart, for I think that greater\nthings await thee.\"\n\nThen she turned about, and saw the dead man, how his feet yet hung in\nthe stirrups as his fellow's had done, save that the horse of this one\nstood nigh still, only reaching his head down to crop a mouthful of\ngrass; so she said: \"Take him away, that I may mount on his horse.\"\n\nSo he drew the dead man's feet out of the stirrups, and dragged him\naway to where the bracken grew deep, and laid him down there, so to say\nhidden.  Then he turned back to the lady, who was pacing up and down\nnear the horse as the beast fed quietly on the cool grass.  When Ralph\ncame back she took the reins in her hand and put one foot in the\nstirrup as if she would mount at once; but suddenly lighted down again,\nand turning to Ralph, cast her arms about him, and kissed his face many\ntimes, blushing red as a rose meantime.  Then lightly she gat her up\ninto the saddle, and bestrode the beast, and smote his flanks with her\nheels, and went her ways riding speedily toward the south-east, so that\nshe was soon out of sight.\n\nBut Ralph stood still looking the way she had gone and wondering at the\nadventure; and he pondered her words and held debate with himself\nwhether he should take the road she bade him.  And he said within\nhimself: \"Hitherto have I been safe and have got no scratch of a weapon\nupon me, and this is a place by seeming for all adventures; and little\nway moreover shall I make in the night if I must needs go to Hampton\nunder Scaur, where dwell those peaceable people; and it is now growing\ndusk already.  So I will abide the morning hereby; but I will be wary\nand let the wood cover me if I may.\"\n\nTherewith he went and drew the body of the slain man down into a little\nhollow where the bracken was high and the brambles grew strong, so that\nit might not be lightly seen.  Then he called to him Falcon, his horse,\nand looked about for cover anigh the want-way, and found a little thin\ncoppice of hazel and sweet chestnut, just where two great oaks had been\nfelled a half score years ago; and looking through the leaves thence,\nhe could see the four ways clearly enough, though it would not be easy\nfor anyone to see him thence.\n\nThither he betook him, and he did the rein off Falcon, but tethered him\nby a halter in the thickest of the copse, and sat down himself nigher\nto the outside thereof; he did off his helm and drew what meat he had\nfrom out his wallet and ate and drank in the beginning of the summer\nnight; and then sat pondering awhile on what had befallen on this\nsecond day of his wandering.  The moon shone out presently, little\nclouded, but he saw her not, for though he strove to wake awhile,\nslumber soon overcame him, and nothing waked him till the night was\npassing, nor did he see aught of that company of which the lady had\nspoken, and which in sooth came not.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nA Meeting and a Parting in the Wood Perilous\n\n\nWhen the first glimmer of dawn was in the sky he awoke in the fresh\nmorning, and sat up and hearkened, for even as he woke he had heard\nsomething, since wariness had made him wakeful.  Now he hears the sound\nof horse-hoofs on the hard road, and riseth to his feet and goeth to\nthe very edge of the copse; looking thence he saw a rider who was just\ncome to the very crossing of the roads.  The new comer was much muffled\nin a wide cloak, but he seemed to be a man low of stature.  He peered\nall round about him as if to see if the way were clear, and then\nalighted down from horseback and let the hood fall off his head, and\nseemed pondering which way were the best to take.  By this time it was\ngrown somewhat lighter and Ralph, looking hard, deemed that the rider\nwas a woman; so he stepped forward lightly, and as he came on to the\nopen sward about the way, the new comer saw him and put a foot into the\nstirrup to mount, but yet looked at him over the shoulder, and then\npresently left the saddle and came forward a few steps as if to meet\nRalph, having cast the cloak to the ground.\n\nThen Ralph saw that it was none other than the damsel of the hostelry\nof Bourton Abbas, and he came up to her and reached out his hand to\nher, and she took it in both hers and held it and said, smiling: \"It is\nnought save mountains that shall never meet.  Here have I followed on\nthy footsteps; yet knew I not where thou wouldst be in the forest.  And\nnow I am glad to have fallen in with thee; for I am going a long way.\"\n\nRalph looked on her and himseemed some pain or shame touched his heart,\nand he said:  \"I am a knight adventurous; I have nought to do save to\nseek adventures.  Why should I not go with thee?\"\n\nShe looked at him earnestly awhile and said:  \"Nay, it may not be; thou\nart a lord's son, and I a yeoman's daughter.\" She stopped, and he said\nnothing in answer.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" said she, \"it is a long way, and I know not how long.\"\nAgain he made no answer, and she said:  \"I am going to seek the WELL AT\nTHE WORLD'S END, and to find it and live, or to find it not, and die.\"\n\nHe spake after a while:  \"Why should I not come with thee?\"\n\nIt was growing light now, and he could see that she reddened and then\nturned pale and set her lips close.\n\nThen she said:  \"Because thou willest it not:  because thou hadst\nliefer make that journey with some one else.\"\n\nHe reddened in his turn, and said:  \"I know of no one else who shall go\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"it is all one, I will not have thee go with me.\"\n\"Yea, and why not?\" said he.  She said:  \"Wilt thou swear to me that\nnought hath happed to thee to change thee betwixt this and Bourton?  If\nthou wilt, then come with me; if thou wilt not, then refrain thee.  And\nthis I say because I see and feel that there is some change in thee\nsince yesterday, so that thou wouldst scarce be dealing truly in being\nmy fellow in this quest:  for they that take it up must be\nsingle-hearted, and think of nought save the quest and the fellow that\nis with them.\"\n\nShe looked on him sadly, and his many thoughts tongue-tied him a while;\nbut at last he said:  \"Must thou verily go on this quest?\" \"Ah,\" she\nsaid, \"now since I have seen thee and spoken with thee again, all need\nthere is that I should follow it at once.\"\n\nThen they both kept silence, and when she spoke again her voice was as\nif she were gay against her will.  She said: \"Here am I come to these\nwant-ways, and there are three roads besides the one I came by, and I\nwot that this that goeth south will bring me to the Burg of the Four\nFriths; and so much I know of the folk of the said Burg that they would\nmock at me if I asked them of the way to the Well at the World's End.\nAnd as for the western way I deem that that will lead me back again to\nthe peopled parts whereof I know; therefore I am minded to take the\neastern way.  What sayest thou, fair lord?\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"I have heard of late that it leadeth presently to Hampton\nunder the Scaur, where dwelleth a people of goodwill.\"\n\n\"Who told thee this tale?\" said she.  Ralph answered, reddening again,\n\"I was told by one who seemed to know both of that folk, and of the\nBurg of the Four Friths, and she said that the folk of Hampton were a\ngood folk, and that they of the Burg were evil.\"\n\nThe damsel smiled sadly when she heard him say 'She,' and when he had\ndone she said:  \"And I have heard, and not from yesterday, that at\nHampton dwelleth the Fellowship of the Dry Tree, and that those of the\nfellowship are robbers and reivers.  Nevertheless they will perchance\nbe little worse than the others; and the tale tells that the way to the\nWell at the World's End is by the Dry Tree; so thither will I at all\nadventure.  And now will I say farewell to thee, for it is most like\nthat I shall not see thee again.\"\n\n\"O, maiden!\" said Ralph, \"why wilt thou not go back to Bourton Abbas?\nThere I might soon meet thee again, and yet, indeed, I also am like to\ngo to Hampton.  Shall I not see thee there?\"\n\nShe shook her head and said:  \"Nay, since I must go so far, I shall not\ntarry; and, sooth to say, if I saw thee coming in at one gate I should\ngo out by the other, for why should I dally with a grief that may not\nbe amended.  For indeed I wot that thou shalt soon forget to wish to\nsee me, either at Bourton Abbas or elsewhere; so I will say no more\nthan once again farewell.\"\n\nThen she came close to him and put her hands on his shoulders and\nkissed his mouth; and then she turned away swiftly, caught up her\ncloak, and gat lightly into the saddle, and so shook her reins and rode\naway east toward Hampton, and left Ralph standing there downcast and\npondering many things.  It was still so early in the summer morning,\nand he knew so little what to do, that presently he turned and walked\nback to his lair amongst the hazels, and there he lay down, and his\nthoughts by then were all gone back again to the lovely lady whom he\nhad delivered, and he wondered if he should ever see her again, and,\nsooth to say, he sorely desired to see her.  Amidst such thoughts he\nfell asleep again, for the night yet owed him something of rest, so\nyoung as he was and so hard as he had toiled, both body and mind,\nduring the past day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nNow Must Ralph Ride For It\n\n\nWhen he awoke again the sun was shining through the hazel leaves,\nthough it was yet early; he arose and looked to his horse, and led him\nout of the hazel copse and stood and looked about him; and lo! a man\ncoming slowly through the wood on Ralph's right hand, and making as it\nseemed for the want-way; he saw Ralph presently, and stopped, and bent\na bow which he held in his hand, and then came towards him warily, with\nthe arrow nocked.  But Ralph went to meet him with his sword in his\nsheath, and leading Falcon by the rein, and the man stopped and took\nthe shaft from the string: he had no armour, but there was a little axe\nand a wood-knife in his girdle; he was clad in homespun, and looked\nlike a carle of the country-side.  Now he greeted Ralph, and Ralph gave\nhim the sele of the day, and saw that the new-comer was both tall and\nstrong, dark of skin and black-haired, but of a cheerful countenance.\nHe spake frank and free to Ralph, and said: \"Whither away, lord, out of\nthe woodland hall, and the dwelling of deer and strong-thieves? I would\nthat the deer would choose them a captain, and gather head and destroy\nthe thieves--and some few others with them.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"I may scarce tell thee till I know myself.  Awhile ago I\nwas minded for the Burg of the Four Friths; but now I am for Hampton\nunder Scaur.\"\n\n\"Yea?\" said the carle, \"when the Devil drives, to hell must we.\"\n\n\"What meanest thou, good fellow?\" said Ralph, \"Is Hampton then so evil\nan abode?\"  And indeed it was in his mind that the adventure of the\nlady led captive bore some evil with it.\n\nSaid the carle:  \"If thou wert not a stranger in these parts I need not\nto answer thy question; but I will answer it presently, yet not till we\nhave eaten, for I hunger, and have in this wallet both bread and\ncheese, and thou art welcome to a share thereof, if thou hungerest\nalso, as is most like, whereas thou art young and fresh coloured.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Ralph, laughing, \"and I also may help to spread this\ntable in the wilderness, since there are yet some crumbs in my wallet.\nLet us sit down and fall to at once.\"\n\n\"By your leave, Sir Gentleman,\" said the carle, \"we will go a few yards\nfurther on, where there is a woodland brook, whereof we may drink when\nmy bottle faileth.\"\n\n\"Nay, I may better that,\" said Ralph, \"for I have wherewithal.\"\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the carle, \"we will go thither, for here is it too\nopen for so small a company as ours, since this want-way hath an ill\nname, and I shall lead thee whereas we shall be somewhat out of the way\nof murder-carles. So come on, if thou trusteth in me.\"\n\nRalph yeasaid him, and they went together a furlong from the want-way\ninto a little hollow place wherethrough ran a clear stream betwixt\nthick-leaved alders.  The carle led Ralph to the very lip of the water\nso that the bushes covered them; there they sat down and drew what they\nhad from their wallets, and so fell to meat; and amidst of the meat the\ncarle said:\n\n\"Fair Knight, as I suppose thou art one, I will ask thee if any need\ndraweth thee to Hampton?\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"The need of giving the go-by to the Burg of the Four\nFriths, since I hear tell that the folk thereof be robbers and\nmurderers.\"\n\n\"Thou shalt find that out better, lord, by going thither; but I shall\ntell thee, that though men may slay and steal there time and time\nabout, yet in regard to Hampton under Scaur, it is Heaven, wherein men\nsin not.  And I am one who should know, for I have been long dwelling\nin Hell, that is Hampton; and now am I escaped thence, and am minded\nfor the Burg, if perchance I may be deemed there a man good enough to\nride in their host, whereby I might avenge me somewhat on them that\nhave undone me: some of whom meseemeth must have put in thy mouth that\nword against the Burg.  Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Ralph, \"for thou seemest to be a true man.\" No more he\nspake though he had half a mind to tell the carle all the tale of that\nadventure; but something held him back when he thought of that lady and\nher fairness.  Yet again his heart misgave him of what might betide\nthat other maiden at Hampton, and he was unquiet, deeming that he must\nneeds follow her thither.  The carle looked on him curiously and\nsomewhat anxiously, but Ralph's eyes were set on something that was not\nthere; or else maybe had he looked closely on the carle he might have\ndeemed that longing to avenge him whereof he spoke did not change his\nface much; for in truth there was little wrath in it.\n\nNow the carle said:  \"Thou hast a tale which thou deemest unmeet for my\nears, as it well may be.  Well, thou must speak, or refrain from\nspeaking, what thou wilt; but thou art so fair a young knight, and so\nblithe with a poor man, and withal I deem that thou mayest help me to\nsome gain and good, that I will tell thee a true tale: and first that\nthe Burg is a good town under a good lord, who is no tyrant nor\noppressor of peaceful men; and that thou mayest dwell there in peace as\nto the folk thereof, who be good folk, albeit they be no dastards to\nlet themselves be cowed by murder-carles.  And next I will tell thee\nthat the folk of the town of Hampton be verily as harmless and innocent\nas sheep; but that they be under evil lords who are not their true\nlords, who lay heavy burdens on them and torment them even to the\ndestroying of their lives: and lastly I will tell thee that I was one\nof those poor people, though not so much a sheep as the more part of\nthem, therefore have these tyrants robbed me of my croft, and set\nanother man in my house; and me they would have slain had I not fled to\nthe wood that it might cover me.  And happy it was for me that I had\nneither wife, nor chick, nor child, else had they done as they did with\nmy brother, whose wife was too fair for him, since he dwelt at Hampton;\nso that they took her away from him to make sport for them of the Dry\nTree, who dwell in the Castle of the Scaur, who shall be thy masters if\nthou goest thither.\n\n\"This is my tale, and thine, I say, I ask not; but I deem that thou\nshalt do ill if thou go not to the Burg either with me or by thyself\nalone; either as a guest, or as a good knight to take service in their\nhost.\"\n\nNow so it was that Ralph was wary; and this time he looked closely at\nthe carle, and found that he spake coldly for a man with so much wrath\nin his heart; therefore he was in doubt about the thing; moreover he\ncalled to mind the words of the lady whom he had delivered, and her\nloveliness, and the kisses she had given him, and he was loth to find\nher a liar; and he was loth also to think that the maiden of Bourton\nhad betaken her to so evil a dwelling.  So he said:\n\n\"Friend, I know not that I must needs be a partaker in the strife\nbetwixt Hampton and the Burg, or go either to one or the other of these\nstrongholds.  Is there no other way out of this wood save by Hampton or\nthe Burg?  or no other place anigh, where I may rest in peace awhile,\nand then go on mine own errands?\"\n\nSaid the Carle:  \"There is a thorp that lieth somewhat west of the\nBurg, which is called Apthorp; but it is an open place, not fenced, and\nis debateable ground, whiles held by them of the Burg, whiles by the\nDry Tree; and if thou tarry there, and they of the Dry Tree take thee,\nsoon is thine errand sped; and if they of the Burg take thee, then\nshalt thou be led into the Burg in worse case than thou wouldest be if\nthou go thereto uncompelled.  What sayest thou, therefore?  Who shall\nhurt thee in the Burg, a town which is under good and strong law, if\nthou be a true man, as thou seemest to be?  And if thou art seeking\nadventures, as may well be, thou shalt soon find them there ready to\nhand.  I rede thee come with me to the Burg; for, to say sooth, I shall\nfind it somewhat easier to enter therein if I be in the company of\nthee, a knight and a lord.\"\n\nSo Ralph considered and thought that there lay indeed but little peril\nto him in the Burg, whereas both those men with whom he had striven\nwere hushed for ever, and there was none else to tell the tale of the\nbattle, save the lady, whose peril from them of the Burg was much\ngreater than his; and also he thought that if anything untoward befel,\nhe had some one to fall back on in old Oliver:  yet on the other hand\nhe had a hankering after Hampton under Scaur, where, to say sooth, he\ndoubted not to see the lady again.\n\nSo betwixt one thing and the other, speech hung on his lips awhile,\nwhen suddenly the carle said:  \"Hist! thou hast left thy horse without\nthe bushes, and he is whinnying\" (which indeed he was), \"there is now\nno time to lose.  To horse straightway, for certainly there are folk at\nhand, and they may be foemen, and are most like to be.\"\n\nTherewith they both arose and hastened to where Falcon stood just\noutside the alder bushes, and Ralph leapt a-horseback without more ado,\nand the carle waited no bidding to leap up behind him, and pointing to\na glade of the wood which led toward the highway, cried out, \"Spur that\nway, thither! they of the Dry Tree are abroad this morning.  Spur! 'tis\nfor life or death!\"\n\nRalph shook the rein and Falcon leapt away without waiting for the\nspur, while the carle looked over his shoulder and said, \"Yonder they\ncome! they are three; and ever they ride well horsed.  Nay, nay!  They\nare four,\" quoth he, as a shout sounded behind them.  \"Spur, young\nlord! spur!  And thine horse is a mettlesome beast.  Yea, it will do,\nit will do.\"\n\nTherewith came to Ralph's ears the sound of their horse-hoofs beating\nthe turf, and he spurred indeed, and Falcon flew forth.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried the carle! \"but take heed, for they see that thy horse is\ngood, and one of them, the last, hath a bent Turk bow in his hand, and\nis laying an arrow on it; as ever their wont is to shoot a-horseback: a\nturn of thy rein, as if thine horse were shying at a weasel on the\nroad!\"\n\nRalph stooped his head and made Falcon swerve, and heard therewith the\ntwang of the bowstring and straightway the shaft flew past his ears.\nFalcon galloped on, and the carle cried out: \"There is the highway\ntoward the Burg!  Do thy best, do thy best!  Lo you again!\"\n\nFor the second shaft flew from the Turkish bow, and the noise of the\nchase was loud behind them.  Once again twanged the bow-string, but\nthis time the arrow fell short, and the woodland man, turning himself\nabout as well as he might, shook his clenched fist at the chase, crying\nout in a voice broken by the gallop: \"Ha, thieves!  I am Roger of the\nRope-walk, I go to twist a rope for the necks of you!\"\n\nThen he spake to Ralph:  \"They are turning back:  they are beaten, and\nwithal they love not the open road:  yet slacken not yet, young knight,\nunless thou lovest thine horse more than thy life; for they will follow\non through the thicket on the way-side to see whether thou wert born a\nfool and hast learned nothing later.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and now I deem thou wilt tell me that to the Burg I\nneeds must.\"\n\n\"Yea, forsooth,\" said the carle, \"nor shall we be long, riding thus,\nere we come to the Burg Gate.\"\n\n\"Yea, or even slower,\" said Ralph, drawing rein somewhat, \"for now I\ndeem the chase done:  and after all is said, I have no will to slay\nFalcon, who is one of my friends, as thou perchance mayest come to be\nanother.\"\n\nThereafter he went a hand-gallop till the wood began to thin, and there\nwere fields of tillage about the highway; and presently Roger said:\n\"Thou mayst breathe thy nag now, and ride single, for we are amidst\nfriends; not even a score of the Dry Tree dare ride so nigh the Burg\nsave by night and cloud.\"\n\nSo Ralph stayed his horse, and he and Roger lighted down, and Ralph\nlooked about him and saw a stone tower builded on a little knoll amidst\na wheatfield, and below it some simple houses thatched with straw;\nthere were folk moreover working, or coming and going about the fields,\nwho took little heed of the two when they saw them standing quiet by\nthe horse's head; but each and all of these folk, so far as could be\nseen, had some weapon.\n\nThen said Ralph:  \"Good fellow, is this the Burg of the Four Friths?\"\nThe carle laughed, and said:  \"Simple is the question, Sir Knight:\nyonder is a watch-tower of the Burg, whereunder husbandmen can live,\nbecause there be men-at-arms therein.  And all round the outskirts of\nthe Frank of the Burg are there such-like towers to the number of\ntwenty-seven. For that, say folk, was the tale of the winters of the\nFair Lady who erewhile began the building of the Burg, when she was\nfirst wedded to the Forest Lord, who before that building had dwelt, he\nand his fathers, in thatched halls of timber here and there about the\nclearings of the wild-wood. But now, knight, if thou wilt, thou mayest\ngo on softly toward the Gate of the Burg, and if thou wilt I will walk\nbeside thy rein, which fellowship, as aforesaid, shall be a gain to me.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"I pray thee come with me, good fellow, and show me how\neasiest to enter this stronghold.\"  So, when Falcon was well breathed,\nthey went on, passing through goodly acres and wide meadows, with here\nand there a homestead on them, and here and there a carle's cot.  Then\ncame they to a thorp of the smallest on a rising ground, from the\nfurther end of which they could see the walls and towers of the Burg.\nThereafter right up to the walls were no more houses or cornfields,\nnought but reaches of green meadows plenteously stored with sheep and\nkine, and with a little stream winding about them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nRalph Entereth Into the Burg of the Four Friths\n\n\nWhen they came up to the wall they saw that it was well builded of good\nashlar, and so high that they might not see the roofs of the town\nbecause of it; but there were tall towers on it, a many of them, strong\nand white.  The road led up straight to the master-gate of the Burg,\nand there was a bailey before it strongly walled, and manned with\nweaponed men, and a captain going about amongst them.  But they entered\nit along with men bringing wares into the town, and none heeded them\nmuch, till they came to the very gate, on the further side of a moat\nthat was both deep and clean; but as now the bridge was down and the\nportcullis up, so that the market-people might pass in easily, for it\nwas yet early in the day.  But before the door on either side stood\nmen-at-arms well weaponed, and on the right side was their captain, a\ntall man with bare grizzled head, but otherwise all-armed, who stopped\nevery one whom he knew not, and asked their business.\n\nAs Ralph came riding up with Roger beside him, one of the guard laid\nhis spear across and bade them stand, and the captain spake in a dry\ncold voice: \"Whence comest thou, man-at-arms?\" \"From the Abbey of St.\nMary at Higham,\" said Ralph.  \"Yea,\" said the captain, smiling grimly,\n\"even so I might have deemed:  thou wilt be one of the Lord Abbot's\nlily lads.\" \"No I am not,\" quoth Ralph angrily.  \"Well, well,\" said the\ncaptain, \"what is thy name?\"\n\n\"Ralph Motherson,\" quoth Ralph, knitting his brow.  Said the captain\n\"And whither wilt thou?\"  Said Ralph, \"On mine own errands.\" \"Thou\nanswerest not over freely,\" quoth the captain.  Said Ralph, \"Then is it\neven; for thou askest freely enough.\" \"Well, well,\" said the captain,\ngrinning in no unfriendly wise, \"thou seemest a stout lad enough; and\nas to my asking, it is my craft as captain of the North Gate:  but now\ntell me friendly, goest thou to any kinsman or friend in the Burg?\"\n\nThen Ralph's brow cleared and he said, \"Nay, fair sir.\" \"Well then,\"\nsaid the captain, \"art thou but riding straight through to another\ngate, and so away again?\"  \"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"if I may, I would abide\nhere the night over, or may-happen longer.\" \"Therein thou shalt do\nwell, young man,\" said the captain; \"then I suppose thou wilt to some\nhostelry? tell me which one.\"\n\nSaid Ralph, \"Nay, I wot not to which one, knowing not the town.\" But\nRoger close by him spake and said:  \"My lord shall go to the Flower de\nLuce, which is in the big square.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said the captain, \"he goes to a good harbour; and moreover,\nfair sir, to-morrow thou shalt see a goodly sight from thine inn; thou\nmayst do no better, lord.  But thou, carle, who art thou, who knowest\nthe inside of our Burg so well, though I know thee not, for as well as\nI know our craftsmen and vavassors?\"\n\nThen Roger's words hung on his lips awhile, and the knight bent his\nbrow on him, till at last he said, \"Sir Captain, I was minded to lie,\nand say that I am this young knight's serving-man.\" The captain broke\nin on him grimly, \"Thou wert best not lie.\"\n\n\"Yea, sir,\" quoth Roger, \"I deemed, as it was on my tongue's end, that\nthou wouldst find me out, so I have nought to do but tell thee the very\nsooth: this it is:  I am a man made masterless by the thieves of the\nDry Tree.  From my land at Hampton under Scaur have I been driven, my\nchattels have been lifted, and my friends slain; and therefore by your\nleave would I ride in the host of the Burg, that I may pay back the\nharm which I had, according to the saw, 'better bale by breeding bale.'\nSo, lord, I ask thee wilt thou lend me the sword and give me the loaf,\nthat I may help both thee, and the Burg, and me?\"\n\nThe captain looked at him closely and sharply, while the carle faced\nhim with open simple eyes, and at last he said: \"Well, carle, thou wert\nabout to name thyself this young knight's serving-man; be thou even so\nwhiles he abideth in the Burg; and when he leaveth the Burg then come\nback to me here any day before noon, and may be I shall then put a\nsword in thy fist and horse between thy thighs.  But,\" (and he wagged\nhis head threateningly at Roger) \"see that thou art at the Flower de\nLuce when thou art called for.\"\n\nRoger held his peace and seemed somewhat abashed at this word, and the\ncaptain turned to Ralph and said courteously:  \"Young knight, if thou\nart seeking adventures, thou shalt find them in our host; and if thou\nbe but half as wise as thou seemest bold, thou wilt not fail to gain\nhonour and wealth both, in the service of the Burg; for we be overmuch\nbeset with foemen that we should not welcome any wight and wary\nwarrior, though he be an alien of blood and land.  If thou thinkest\nwell of this, then send me thy man here and give me word of thy mind,\nand I shall lead thee to the chiefs of the Port, and make the way easy\nfor thee.\"\n\nRalph thanked him and rode through the gate into the street, and Roger\nstill went beside his stirrup.\n\nPresently Ralph turned to Roger and spake to him somewhat sourly, and\nsaid:  \"Thou hadst one lie in thy mouth and didst swallow it; but how\nshall I know that another did not come out thence?  Withal thou must\nneeds be my fellow here, will I, nill I; for thou it was that didst put\nthat word into the captain's mouth that thou shouldst serve me while I\nabide in the Burg.  So I will say here and now, that my mind misgives\nme concerning thee, whether thou be not of those very thieves and\ntyrants whom thou didst mis-say but a little while ago.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Roger, \"thou art wise indeed to set me down as one of the\nDry Tree; doubtless that is why I delivered thee from their ambush even\nnow.  And as for my service, thou mayst need it; for indeed I deem thee\nnot so safe as thou deemest thyself in this Burg.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Ralph, \"Dost thou blow hot and cold? why even now, when we\nwere in the wood, thou wert telling me that I had nought at all to fear\nin the Burg of the Four Friths, and that all was done there by reason\nand with justice.  What is this new thing then which thou hast found\nout, or what is that I have to fear?\"\n\nRoger changed countenance thereat and seemed somewhat confused, as one\nwho has been caught unawares; but he gat his own face presently, and\nsaid:  \"Nay, Sir Knight, I will tell thee the truth right out.  In the\nwood yonder thy danger was great that thou mightest run into the hands\nof them of the Dry Tree; therefore true it is that I spake somewhat\nbeyond my warrant concerning the life of the folk of the Burg, as how\ncould I help it?  But surely whatever thy peril may be here, it is\nnought to that which awaited thee at Hampton.\"\n\n\"Nay, but what is the peril?\" said Ralph.  Quoth Roger, \"If thou wilt\nbecome their man and enter into their host, there is none; for they\nwill ask few questions of so good a man-at-arms, when they know that\nthou art theirs; but if thou naysay that, it may well be that they will\nbe for turning the key on thee till thou tellest them what and whence\nthou art.\" Ralph answered nought, thinking in his mind that this was\nlike enough; so he rode on soberly, till Roger said:\n\n\"Anyhow, thou mayst turn the cold shoulder on me if thou wilt.  Yet\nwere I thee, I would not, for so it is, both that I can help thee, as I\ndeem, in time to come, and that I have helped thee somewhat in time\npast.\"\n\nNow Ralph was young and could not abide the blame of thanklessness; so\nhe said, \"Nay, nay, fellow, go we on together to the Flower de Luce.\"\n\nRoger nodded his head and grumbled somewhat, and they made no stay\nexcept that now and again Ralph drew rein to look at goodly things in\nthe street, for there were many open booths therein, so that the whole\nstreet looked like a market.  The houses were goodly of building, but\nnot very tall, the ways wide and well-paved. Many folk were in the\nstreet, going up and down on their errands, and both men and women of\nthem seemed to Ralph stout and strong, but not very fair of favour.\nWithal they seemed intent on their business, and payed little heed to\nRalph and his fellow, though he was by his attire plainly a stranger.\n\nNow Ralph sees a house more gaily adorned than most, and a sign hung\nout from it whereon was done an image of St. Loy, and underneath the\nsame a booth on which was set out weapons and war-gear exceeding\ngoodly; and two knaves of the armourer were standing by to serve folk,\nand crying their wares with \"what d'ye lack?\" from time to time.  So he\nstayed and fell to looking wistfully at the gleam and glitter of those\nfair things, till one of the aforesaid knaves came to his side and said:\n\n\"Fair Sir, surely thou lackest somewhat; what have we here for thy\nneeds?\"  So Ralph thought and called to mind that strong little steel\naxe of the man whom he had slain yesterday, and asked for the sight of\nsuch a weapon, if he might perchance cheapen it.  And the lad brought a\nvery goodly steel axe, gold-inlaid about the shaft, and gave him the\nprice thereof, which Ralph deemed he might compass; so he brought round\nhis scrip to his hand, that he might take out the money.  But while his\nhand was yet in the bag, out comes the master-armourer, a tall and very\nstark carle, and said in courteous wise: \"Sir Knight, thou art a\nstranger to me and I know thee not; so I must needs ask for a sight of\nthy license to buy weapons, under the seal of the Burg.\"\n\n\"Hear a wonder,\" said Ralph, \"that a free man for his money shall not\nbuy wares set out to be bought, unless he have the Burg-Reeve's hand\nand seal for it!  Nay, take thy florins, master, and give me the axe\nand let the jest end there.\" \"I jest not, young rider,\" quoth the\narmourer.  \"When we know thee for a liegeman of the Burg, thou shalt\nbuy what thou wilt without question; but otherwise I have told thee the\nlaw, and how may I, the master of the craft, break the law?  Be not\nwrath, fair sir, I will set aside thine axe for thee, till thou bring\nme the license, or bid me come see it, and thou shalt get the said\nlicense at the Town Hall straight-way, when they may certify thee no\nfoeman of the Burg.\"\n\nRalph saw that it availed nothing to bicker with the smith, and so went\nhis way somewhat crestfallen, and that the more as he saw Roger\ngrinning a little.\n\nNow they come into the market-place, on one side whereof was the master\nchurch of the town, which was strongly built and with a tall tower to\nit, but was not very big, and but little adorned.  Over against it they\nsaw the sign of the Flower de Luce, a goodly house and great.\nThitherward they turned; but in the face of the hostelry amidmost the\nplace was a thing which Roger pointed at with a grin that spoke as well\nas words; and this was a high gallows-tree furnished with four forks or\narms, each carved and wrought in the fashion of the very bough of a\ntree, from which dangled four nooses, and above them all was a board\nwhereon was written in big letters THE DRY TREE.  And at the foot of\nthis gallows were divers folk laughing and talking.\n\nSo Ralph understood at once that those four men whom he had seen led\naway bound yesterday should be hanged thereon; so he stayed a franklin\nwho was passing by, and said to him, \"Sir, I am a stranger in the town,\nand I would know if justice shall be done on the four woodmen to-day.\"\n\"Nay,\" said the man, \"but to-morrow; they are even now before the\njudges.\"\n\nThen said Roger in a surly voice, \"Why art thou not there to look on?\"\n\"Because,\" quoth the man, \"there is little to see there, and not much\nmore to hearken.  The thieves shall be speedily judged, and not\nquestioned with torments, so that they may be the lustier to feel what\nthe hangman shall work on them to-morrow; then forsooth the show shall\nbe goodly.  But far better had it been if we had had in our hands the\ngreat witch of these dastards, as we looked to have her; but now folk\nsay that she has not been brought within gates, and it is to be feared\nthat she hath slipped through our fingers once more.\"\n\nRoger laughed, and said:  \"Simple are ye folk of the Burg and know\nnought of her shifts.  I tell thee it is not unlike that she is in the\nBurg even now, and hath in hand to take out of your prison the four\nwhom ye have caught.\"\n\nThe franklin laughed scornfully in his turn and said: \"If we be simple,\nthou art a fool merely:  are we not stronger and more than the Dry\nTree?  How should she not be taken?  How should she not be known if she\nwere walking about these streets?  Have we no eyes, fool-carle?\" And he\nlaughed again, for he was wroth.\n\nRalph hearkened, and a kind of fear seemed griping his heart, so he\nasked the franklin:  \"Tell me, sir, are ye two speaking of a woman who\nis Queen of these strong-thieves?\" \"Yea,\" said he, \"or it might better\nbe said that she is their goddess, their mawmet, their devil, the very\nheart and soul of their wickedness.  But one day shall we have her body\nand soul, and then shall her body have but an evil day of it till she\ndieth in this world.\"\n\n\"Yea, forsooth, if she can die at all,\" quoth Roger.\n\nThe franklin looked sourly on him and said:  \"Good man, thou knowest\nmuch of her, meseemeth--Whence art thou?\" Said Roger speedily:  \"From\nHampton under Scaur; and her rebel I am, and her dastard, and her\nrunaway.  Therefore I know her forsooth.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the Franklin said, \"thou seemest a true man, and yet I would\ncounsel thee to put a rein on thy tongue when thou art minded to talk\nof the Devil of the Dry Tree, or thou mayst come to harm in the Burg.\"\n\nHe walked away towards the gallows therewith; and Roger said, almost as\nif he were talking to himself; \"A heavy-footed fool goeth yonder; but\nafter this talk we were better hidden by the walls of the\nFlower-de-Luce.\" So therewith they went on toward the hostel.\n\nBut the market place was wide, and they were yet some minutes getting\nto the door, and ere they came there Ralph said, knitting his brows\nanxiously: \"Is this woman fair or foul to look on?\"  \"That is nought so\neasy to tell of,\" said Roger, \"whiles she is foul, whiles very fair,\nwhiles young and whiles old; whiles cruel and whiles kind.  But note\nthis, when she is the kindest then are her carles the cruellest; and\nshe is the kinder to them because they are cruel.\"\n\nRalph pondered what he said, and wondered if this were verily the woman\nwhom he had delivered, or some other.  As if answering to his unspoken\nthought, Roger went on: \"They speak but of one woman amongst them of\nthe Dry Tree, but in sooth they have many others who are like unto her\nin one way or other; and this again is a reason why they may not lay\nhands on the very Queen of them all.\"\n\nTherewithal they came unto the hostel, and found it fair enough within,\nthe hall great and goodly for such a house, and with but three\nchapmen-carles therein.  Straightway they called for meat, for it was\nnow past noon, and the folk of the house served them when the grooms\nhad taken charge of Falcon.  And Roger served Ralph as if he were\nverily his man.  Then Ralph went to his chamber aloft and rested a\nwhile, but came down into the hall a little before nones, and found\nRoger there walking up and down the hall floor, and no man else, so he\nsaid to him:  \"Though thou art not of the Burg, thou knowest it; wilt\nthou not come abroad then, and show it me? for I have a mind to learn\nthe ways of the folk here.\"\n\nSaid Roger, and smiled a little:  \"If thou commandest me as my lord, I\nwill come; yet I were better pleased to abide behind; for I am weary\nwith night-waking and sorrow; and have a burden of thought, one which I\nmust bear to the end of the road; and if I put it down I shall have to\ngo back and take it up again.\"\n\nRalph thought that he excused himself with more words than were needed;\nbut he took little heed of it, but nodded to him friendly, and went out\nof the house afoot, but left his weapons and armour behind him by the\nrede of Roger.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nThe Streets of the Burg of the Four Friths\n\n\nHe went about the streets and found them all much like to the one which\nthey had entered by the north gate; he saw no poor or wretched houses,\nand none very big as of great lords; they were well and stoutly\nbuilded, but as aforesaid not much adorned either with carven work or\npainting: there were folk enough in the streets, and now Ralph, as was\nlike to be, looked specially at the women, and thought many of them\nlittle better-favoured than the men, being both dark and low; neither\nwere they gaily clad, though their raiment, like the houses, was stout\nand well wrought.  But here and there he came on a woman taller and\nwhiter than the others, as though she were of another blood; all such\nof these as he saw were clad otherwise than the darker women: their\nheads uncoifed, uncovered save for some garland or silken band: their\ngowns yellow like wheat-straw, but gaily embroidered; sleeveless withal\nand short, scarce reaching to the ancles, and whiles so thin that they\nwere rather clad with the embroidery than the cloth; shoes they had\nnot, but sandals bound on their naked feet with white thongs, and each\nbore an iron ring about her right arm.\n\nThe more part of the men wore weapons at their sides and had staves in\nhand, and were clad in short jerkins brown or blue of colour, and\nlooked ready for battle if any moment should call them thereto; but\namong them were men of different favour and stature from these, taller\nfor the most part, unarmed, and clad in long gowns of fair colours with\ncloths of thin and gay-coloured web twisted about their heads.  These\nhe took for merchants, as they were oftenest standing in and about the\nbooths and shops, whereof there were some in all the streets, though\nthe market for victuals and such like he found over for that day, and\nbut scantily peopled.\n\nOut of one of these markets, which was the fish and fowl market, he\ncame into a long street that led him down to a gate right over against\nthat whereby he had entered the Burg; and as he came thereto he saw\nthat there was a wide way clear of all houses inside of the wall, so\nthat men-at-arms might go freely from one part to the other; and he had\nalso noted that a wide way led from each port out of the great place,\nand each ended not but in a gate.  But as to any castle in the town, he\nsaw none; and when he asked a burgher thereof, the carle laughed in his\nface, and said to him that the whole Burg, houses and all, was a\ncastle, and that it would turn out to be none of the easiest to win.\nAnd forsooth Ralph himself was much of that mind.\n\nNow he was just within the south gate when he held this talk, and there\nwere many folk thereby already, and more flocking thereto; so he stood\nthere to see what should betide; and anon he heard great blowing of\nhorns and trumpets all along the wall, and, as he deemed, other horns\nanswered from without; and so it was; for soon the withoutward horns\ngrew louder, and the folk fell back on either side of the way, and next\nthe gates were thrown wide open (which before had been shut save for a\nwicket) and thereafter came the first of a company of men-at-arms,\nfoot-men, with bills some, and some with bows, and all-armed knights\nand sergeants a-horseback.\n\nSo streamed in these weaponed men till Ralph saw that it was a great\nhost that was entering the Burg; and his heart rose within him, so\nwarrior-like they were of men and array, though no big men of their\nbodies; and many of them bore signs of battle about them, both in the\nbattering of their armour and the rending of their raiment, and the\nclouts tied about the wounds on their bodies.\n\nAfter a while among the warriors came herds of neat and flocks of sheep\nand strings of horses, of the spoil which the host had lifted; and then\nwains filled, some with weapons and war gear, and some with bales of\ngoods and household stuff.  Last came captives, some going afoot and\nsome for weariness borne in wains; for all these war-taken thralls were\nwomen and women-children; of males there was not so much as a little\nlad.  Of the women many seemed fair to Ralph despite their grief and\ntravel; and as he looked on them he deemed that they must be of the\nkindred and nation of the fair white women he had seen in the streets;\nthough they were not clad like those, but diversely.\n\nSo Ralph gazed on this pageant till all had passed, and he was weary\nwith the heat and the dust and the confused clamour of shouting and\nlaughter and talking; and whereas most of the folk followed after the\nhost and their spoil, the streets of the town there about were soon\nleft empty and peaceful.  So he turned into a street narrower than\nmost, that went east from the South Gate and was much shaded from the\nafternoon sun, and went slowly down it, meaning to come about the\ninside of the wall till he should hit the East Gate, and so into the\nGreat Place when the folk should have gone their ways home.\n\nHe saw no folk in the street save here and there an old woman sitting\nat the door of her house, and maybe a young child with her.  As he came\nto where the street turned somewhat, even such a carline was sitting on\na clean white door-step on the sunny side, somewhat shaded by a tall\nrose-laurel tree in a great tub, and she sang as she sat spinning, and\nRalph stayed to listen in his idle mood, and he heard how she sang in a\ndry, harsh voice:\n\n    Clashed sword on shield In the harvest field;\n    And no man blames The red red flames,\n    War's candle-wick On roof and rick.\n    Now dead lies the yeoman unwept and unknown\n    On the field he hath furrowed, the ridge he hath sown:\n    And all in the middle of wethers and neat\n    The maidens are driven with blood on their feet;\n    For yet 'twixt the Burg-gate and battle half-won\n    The dust-driven highway creeps uphill and on,\n    And the smoke of the beacons goes coiling aloft,\n    While the gathering horn bloweth loud, louder and oft.\n\n    Throw wide the gates\n    For nought night waits;\n    Though the chase is dead\n    The moon's o'erhead\n    And we need the clear\n    Our spoil to share.\n    Shake the lots in the helm then for brethren are we,\n    And the goods of my missing are gainful to thee.\n    Lo! thine are the wethers, and his are the kine;\n    And the colts of the marshland unbroken are thine,\n    With the dapple-grey stallion that trampled his groom;\n    And Giles hath the gold-blossomed rose of the loom.\n    Lo! leaps out the last lot and nought have I won,\n    But the maiden unmerry, by battle undone.\n\n\nEven as her song ended came one of those fair yellow-gowned damsels\nround the corner of the street, bearing in her hand a light basket full\nof flowers: and she lifted up her head and beheld Ralph there; then she\nwent slowly and dropped her eyelids, and it was pleasant to Ralph to\nbehold her; for she was as fair as need be.  Her corn-coloured gown was\ndainty and thin, and but for its silver embroidery had hidden her limbs\nbut little; the rosiness of her ancles showed amidst her white\nsandal-thongs, and there were silver rings and gold on her arms along\nwith the iron ring.\n\nNow she lifted up her eyes and looked shyly at Ralph, and he smiled at\nher well-pleased, and deemed it would be good to hear her voice; so he\nwent up to her and greeted her, and she seemed to take his greeting\nwell, though she glanced swiftly at the carline in the doorway.\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Fair maiden, I am a stranger in this town, and have seen\nthings I do not wholly understand; now wilt thou tell me before I ask\nthe next question, who will be those war-taken thralls whom even now I\nsaw brought into the Burg by the host? of what nation be they, and of\nwhat kindred?\"\n\nStraightway was the damsel all changed; she left her dainty tricks, and\ndrew herself up straight and stiff.  She looked at him in the eyes,\nflushing red, and with knit brows, a moment, and then passed by him\nwith swift and firm feet as one both angry and ashamed.\n\nBut the carline who had beheld the two with a grin on her wrinkled face\nchanged aspect also, and cried out fiercely after the damsel, and said:\n\"What! dost thou flee from the fair young man, and he so kind and soft\nwith thee, thou jade?  Yea, I suppose thou dost fetch and carry for\nsome mistress who is young and a fool, and who has not yet learned how\nto deal with the daughters of thine accursed folk.  Ah! if I had but\nmoney to buy some one of you, and a good one, she should do something\nelse for me than showing her fairness to young men; and I would pay her\nfor her long legs and her white skin, till she should curse her fate\nthat she had not been born little and dark-skinned and free, and with\nheels un-bloodied with the blood of her back.\"\n\nThus she went on, though the damsel was long out of ear-shot of her\ncurses; and Ralph tarried not to get away from her spiteful babble,\nwhich he now partly understood; and that all those yellow-clad damsels\nwere thralls to the folk of the Burg; and belike were of the kindred of\nthose captives late-taken whom he had seen amidst the host at its\nentering into the Burg.\n\nSo he wandered away thence thinking on what he should do till the sun\nwas set, and he had come into the open space underneath the walls, and\nhad gone along it till he came to the East Gate: there he looked around\nhim a little and found people flowing back from the Great Place,\nwhereto they had gathered to see the host mustered and the spoil\nblessed; then he went on still under the wall, and noted not that here\nand there a man turned about to look upon him curiously, for he was\ndeep in thought, concerning the things which he had seen and heard of,\nand pondered much what might have befallen his brethren since they\nsundered at the Want-way nigh to the High House of Upmeads.  Withal the\nchief thing that he desired was to get him away from the Burg, for he\nfelt himself unfree therein; and he said to himself that if he were\nforced to dwell among this folk, that he had better never have stolen\nhimself away from his father and mother; and whiles even he thought\nthat he would do his best on the morrow to get him back home to Upmeads\nagain.  But then when he thought of how his life would go in his old\nhome, there seemed to him a lack, and when he questioned himself as to\nwhat that lack was, straightway he seemed to see that Lady of the\nWildwood standing before the men-at-arms in her scanty raiment the\nminute before his life was at adventure because of them.  And in sooth\nhe smiled to himself then with a beating heart, as he told himself that\nabove all things he desired to see that Lady, whatever she might be,\nand that he would follow his adventure to the end until he met her.\n\nAmidst these thoughts he came unto the North Gate, whereby he had first\nentered the Burg, and by then it was as dark as the summer night would\nbe; so he woke up from his dream, as it were, and took his way briskly\nback to the Flower de Luce.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nWhat Ralph Heard of the Matters of the Burg of the Four Friths\n\n\nThere was no candle in the hall when he entered, but it was not so dark\ntherein but he might see Roger sitting on a stool near the chimney, and\nopposite to him on the settle sat two men; one very tall and big, the\nother small; Roger was looking away from these, and whistling; and it\ncame into Ralph's mind that he would have him think that he had nought\nto do with them, whether that were so or not.  But he turned round as\nRalph came up the hall and rose and came up to him, and fell to talking\nwith him and asking him how he liked the Burg; and ever he spake fast\nand loud, so that again it came on Ralph that he was playing a part.\n\nRalph heeded him little, but ever looked through the hall-dusk on those\ntwain, who presently arose and went toward the hall door, but when they\nwere but half-way across the floor a chamberlain came in suddenly,\nbearing candles in his hands, and the light fell on those guests and\nflashed back from a salade on the head of the big man, and Ralph saw\nthat he was clad in a long white gaberdine, and he deemed that he was\nthe very man whom he had seen last in the Great Place at Higham, nigh\nthe church, and before that upon the road.  As for the smaller man\nRalph had no knowledge of him, for he could see but little of his face,\nwhereas he was wrapped up in a cloak, for as warm as the evening was,\nand wore a slouch hat withal; but his eyes seemed great and wondrous\nbright.\n\nBut when they were gone Ralph asked Roger if he knew aught of them, or\nif they had told him aught.  \"Nay,\" said Roger, \"they came in here as I\nsat alone, and had their meat, and spake nought to me, and little to\neach other.  I deem them not to be of the Burg.  Nay, sooth to say, I\ndoubt if they be true men.\"\n\nAs he spake came in a sort of the townsmen somewhat merry and noisy,\nand called for meat and drink and more lights; so that the board was\nbrought and the hall was speedily astir.  These men, while supper was\nbeing dight, fell to talking to Ralph and Roger, and asking them\nquestions of whence and whither, but nowise uncourteously:  to whom\nRoger answered with the tale which he had told Ralph, and Ralph told\nwhat he would, and that was but little.\n\nBut when the board was dight they bade them sit down with them and eat.\nRalph sat down at once, and Roger would have served him, but Ralph bade\nhim do it not, and constrained him to sit by his side, and they two sat\na little apart from the townsmen.\n\nSo when they had eaten their fill, and wine was brought, and men were\ndrinking kindly, Ralph began to ask Roger concerning those women whom\nhe had seen in the street, and the captives whom he had seen brought in\nby the host, and if they were of one kindred, and generally how it was\nwith them:  and he spake somewhat softly as if he would not break into\nthe talk of the townsmen: but Roger answered him in a loud voice so\nthat all could hear:\n\n\"Yea, lord, I will tell thee the tale of them, which setteth forth well\nboth the wise policy and the great mercy of the folk of the Burg and\ntheir rulers.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Are these women also of the Dry Tree?  For I perceive\nthem to be born of the foes of the Burg.\"\n\nNow the townsmen had let their talk drop a while to listen to the talk\nof the aliens; and Roger answered still in a loud voice: \"Nay, nay, it\nis not so.  These queens are indeed war-taken thralls, but not from\nthem of the Dry Tree, or they would have been slain at once, like as\nthe carles of those accursed ones.  But these are of the folk of the\nWheat-wearers, even as those whom thou sawest brought to-day amidst the\nother spoil.  And to this folk the Burg showeth mercy, and whenso the\nhost goeth against them and over-cometh (and that is well-nigh whenever\nthey meet) these worthy lords slay no woman of them, but the men only,\nwhether they be old or young or youngest.  As for their women they are\nbrought hither and sold at the market-cross to the highest bidder.  And\nthis honour they have, that such of them as be fair, and that is the\nmore part of the younger ones, fetch no ill penny.  Yet for my part I\nwere loth to cheapen such wares:  for they make but evil servants,\nbeing proud, and not abiding stripes lightly, or toiling the harder for\nthem; and they be somewhat too handy with the knife if they deem\nthemselves put upon.  Speak I sooth, my masters?\" quoth he, turning\ntoward them of the town.\n\nSaid a burgher somewhat stricken in years, \"Nought but sooth; peaceable\nmen like to me eschew such servants; all the more because of this, that\nif one of these queens misbehave with the knife, or strayeth from her\nmaster's bed, the laws of the Burg meddle not therein.  For the wise\nmen say that such folk are no more within the law than kine be, and may\nnot for their deeds be brought before leet or assize any more than\nkine.  So that if the master punish her not for her misdoings,\nunpunished she needs must go; yea even if her deed be mere murder.\"\n\n\"That is sooth,\" said a somewhat younger man; \"yet whiles it fareth ill\nwith them at the hands of our women.  To wit, my father's brother has\neven now come from the war to find his thrall all spoilt by his wife:\nand what remedy may he have against his wife? his money is gone, even\nas if she had houghed his horse or his best cow.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said a third, \"we were better without such cattle.  A thrust\nwith a sword and all the tale told, were the better way of dealing with\nthem.\"\n\nSaid another; \"Yet are the queens good websters, and, lacking them,\nfigured cloth of silk would be far-fetched and dear-bought here.\"\n\nA young man gaily clad, who had been eyeing the speakers disdainfully,\nspake next and said:  \"Fair sirs, ye are speaking like hypocrites, and\nas if your lawful wives were here to hearken to you; whereas ye know\nwell how goodly these thralls be, and that many of them can be kind\nenough withal; and ye would think yourselves but ill bestead if ye\nmight not cheapen such jewels for your money.  Which of you will go to\nthe Cross next Saturday and there buy him a fairer wife than he can wed\nout of our lineages? and a wife withal of whose humours he need take no\nmore account of than the dullness of his hound or the skittish temper\nof his mare, so long as the thong smarts, and the twigs sting.\"\n\nOne or two grinned as he spake, but some bent their brows at him, yet\nscarce in earnest, and the talk thereover dropped, nor did Ralph ask\nany more questions; for he was somewhat down-hearted, calling to mind\nthe frank and free maidens of Upmead, and their friendly words and\nhearty kisses.  And him seemed the world was worse than he had looked\nto find it.\n\nHowsoever, the oldest and soberest of the guests, seeing that he was a\nstranger and of noble aspect, came unto him and sat by him, and fell to\ntelling him tales of the wars of the men of the Burg with the\nWheat-wearers; and how in time past, when the town was but little\nfenced, the Wheat-wearers had stormed their gates and taken the city,\nand had made a great slaughter; but yet had spared many of the\nfighting-men, although they had abided there as the masters of them,\nand held them enthralled for three generations of men: after which time\nthe sons' sons of the old Burg-dwellers having grown very many again,\nand divers of them being trusted in sundry matters by the conquerors,\nwho oppressed them but little, rose up against them as occasion served,\nin the winter season and the Yule feast, and slew their masters, save\nfor a few who were hidden away.\n\n\"And thereafter,\" quoth he, \"did we make the Burg strong and hard to\nwin, as ye see it to-day; and we took for our captain the Forest Lord,\nwho ere-while had dwelt in the clearings of the wildwood, and he wedded\nthe Fair Lady who was the son's daughter of him who had been our lord\nere the Wheat-wearers overcame us; and we grew safe and free and mighty\nagain.  And the son of the Forest Lord, he whom we call the War-smith,\nhe it was who beheld the Burg too much given to pleasure, and\ndelighting in the softness of life; and he took order to harden our\nhearts, and to cause all freemen to learn the craft of war and battle,\nand let the women and thralls and aliens see to other craftsmanship and\nto chaffer; and even so is it done as he would; and ye shall find us\nhardy of heart enough, though belike not so joyous as might be.  Yet at\nleast we shall not be easy to overcome.\"\n\n\"So indeed it seemeth,\" said Ralph.  \"Yet will I ask of you first one\nquestion, and then another.\"\n\n\"Ask on,\" said the burgher.\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"How is it that ye, being so strong, should still suffer\nthem of the Dry Tree, taking a man here and a man there, when ye might\ndestroy them utterly?\"\n\nThe Burgher reddened and cleared his throat and said: \"Sir, it must be\nmade clear to you that these evil beasts are no peril to the Burg of\nthe Four Friths; all the harm they may do us, is as when a cur dog\nbiteth a man in the calf of the leg; whereby the man shall be grieved\nindeed, but the dog slain.  Such grief as that they have done us at\nwhiles:  but the grief is paid for thus, that the hunting and slaying\nof them keeps our men in good trim, and pleasures them; shortly to say\nit, they are the chief deer wherewith our wood is stocked.\"\n\nHe stopped awhile and then went on again and said:  \"To say sooth they\nbe not very handy for crushing as a man crushes a wasp, because sorcery\ngoes with them, and the wiles of one who is their Queen, the evilest\nwoman who ever spat upon the blessed Host of the Altar: yet is she\nstrong, a devouring sea of souls, God help us!\" And he blessed himself\ntherewith.\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Yet a word on these Wheat-wearers; it seemeth that ye\nnever fail to overcome them in battle?\"\n\n\"But seldom at least,\" quoth the Burgher.\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Then it were no great matter for you to gather a host\noverwhelming, and to take their towns and castles, and forbid them\nweapons, and make them your thralls to till the land for you which now\nthey call theirs; so that ye might have of their gettings all save what\nwere needful for them to live as thralls.\"\n\n\"I deem it were an easy thing,\" said the burgher.\n\nQuoth Ralph:  \"Then why do ye not so?\"\n\n\"It were but a poor game to play,\" said the burgher.  \"Such of their\nwealth as we have a mind to, we can have now at the cost of a battle or\ntwo, begun one hour and ended the next: were we their masters sitting\ndown amidst of their hatred, and amidst of their plotting, yea, and in\nthe very place where that were the hottest and thickest, the battle\nwould be to begin at every sun's uprising, nor would it be ended at any\nsunset.  Hah! what sayest thou?\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"This seemeth to me but the bare truth; yet it is little\nafter the manner of such masterful men as ye be.  But why then do ye\nslay all their carles that are taken; whereas ye bear away the women\nand make thralls of them at home, that is to say, foes in every house?\"\n\n\"It may be,\" said the Burgher, \"that this is not amongst the wisest of\nour dealings.  Yet may we do no otherwise; for thus we swore to do by\nall the greatest oaths that we might swear, in the days when we first\ncast off their yoke, and yet were not over strong at the first; and now\nit hath so grown into a part of our manners, yea, and of our very\nhearts and minds, that the slaying of a Wheat-wearer is to us a lighter\nmatter than the smiting of a rabbit or a fowmart.  But now, look you,\nfair sir, my company ariseth from table; so I bid thee a good night.\nAnd I give thee a good rede along with the good wish, to wit, that thou\nask not too many questions in this city concerning its foemen: for here\nis the stranger looked upon with doubt, if he neither will take the\nwages of the Burg for battle, nor hath aught to sell.\"\n\nRalph reddened at his word, and the other looked at him steadily as he\nspoke, so that Ralph deemed that he mistrusted him: he deemed moreover\nthat three or four of the others looked hard at him as they went\ntowards the door, while Roger stood somewhat smiling, and humming a\nsnatch of an old song.\n\nBut when the other guests had left the hostelry, Roger left his\nsinging, and turned to Ralph and said:  \"Master, meseems that they\nmistrust us, and now maybe is that peril that I spake of nigher than I\ndeemed when we came into the Burg this morning.  And now I would that\nwe were well out of the Burg and in the merry greenwood again, and it\nrepents me that I brought thee hither.\"\n\n\"Nay, good fellow,\" quoth Ralph, \"heed it not:  besides, it was me, not\nthee, that they seemed to doubt of.  I will depart hence to-morrow\nmorning no worser than I came, and leave thee to seek thy fortune here;\nand good luck go with thee.\"\n\nRoger looked hard at him and said:  \"Not so, young lord; if thou goest\nI will go with thee, for thou hast won my heart, I know not how: and I\nwould verily be thy servant, to follow thee whithersoever thou goest;\nfor I think that great deeds will come of thee.\"\n\nThis word pleased Ralph, for he was young and lightly put faith in\nmen's words, and loved to be well thought of, and was fain of good\nfellowship withal.  So he said: \"This is a good word of thine, and I\nthank thee for it; and look to it that in my adventures, and the reward\nof them thou shalt have thy due share.  Lo here my hand on it!\"\n\nRoger took his hand, yet therewith his face seemed a little troubled,\nbut he said nought.  Then spoke Ralph: \"True it is that I am not fain\nto take the wages of the Burg; for it seems to me that they be hard\nmen, and cruel and joyless, and that their service shall be rather\nchurlish than knightly.  Howbeit, let night bring counsel, and we will\nsee to this to-morrow; for now I am both sleepy and weary.\"  Therewith\nhe called the chamberlain, who bore a wax light before him to his\nchamber, and he did off his raiment and cast himself on his bed, and\nfell asleep straightway, before he knew where Roger was sleeping,\nwhether it were in the hall or some place else.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nHow Ralph Departed From the Burg of the Four Friths\n\n\nHimseemed he had scarce been asleep a minute ere awoke with a sound of\nsomeone saying softly, \"Master, master, awake!\"  So he sat up and\nanswered softly in his turn:  \"Who is it? what is amiss, since the\nnight is yet young?\"\n\n\"I am thy fellow-farer, Roger,\" said the speaker, \"and this thou hast\nto do, get on thy raiment speedily, and take thy weapons without noise,\nif thou wouldst not be in the prison of the Burg before sunrise.\"\n\nRalph did as he was bidden without more words; for already when he lay\ndown his heart misgave him that he was in no safe place; he looked to\nhis weapons and armour that they should not clash, and down they came\ninto the hall and found the door on the latch; so out they went and\nRalph saw that it was somewhat cloudy; the moon was set and it was\ndark, but Ralph knew by the scent that came in on the light wind, and a\nlittle stir of blended sounds, that it was hard on dawning; and even\ntherewith he heard the challenge of the warders on the walls and their\ncrying of the hour; and the chimes of the belfry rang clear and loud,\nand seeming close above him, two hours and a half after midnight.\nRoger spake not, and Ralph was man-at-arms enough to know that he must\nhold his peace; and though he longed sore to have his horse Falcon with\nhim, yet he wotted that it availed not to ask of his horse, since he\ndurst not ask of his life.\n\nSo they went on silently till they were out of the Great Place and came\ninto a narrow street, and so into another which led them straight into\nthe houseless space under the wall.  Roger led right on as if he knew\nthe way well, and in a twinkling were they come to a postern in the\nwall betwixt the East Gate and the South.  By the said postern Ralph\nsaw certain men standing; and on the earth near by, whereas he was\nkeen-eyed, he saw more than one man lying moveless.\n\nSpake Roger softly to the men who stood on their feet: \"Is the rope\ntwined?\"  \"Nay, rope-twiner,\" said one of them.  Then Roger turned and\nwhispered to Ralph:  \"Friends.  Get out thy sword!\" Wherewithal the\ngate was opened, and they all passed out through the wall, and stood\nabove the ditch in the angle-nook of a square tower.  Then Ralph saw\nsome of the men stoop and shoot out a broad plank over the ditch, which\nwas deep but not wide thereabout, and straightway he followed the\nothers over it, going last save Roger.  By then they were on the other\nside he saw a glimmer of the dawn in the eastern heaven, but it was\nstill more than dusk, and no man spoke again.  They went on softly\nacross the plain fields outside the wall, creeping from bush to bush,\nand from tree to tree, for here, if nowhere about the circuit of the\nBurg, were a few trees growing.  Thus they came into a little wood and\npassed through it, and then Ralph could see that the men were six\nbesides Roger; by the glimmer of the growing dawn he saw before them a\nspace of meadows with high hedges about them, and a dim line that he\ntook for the roof of a barn or grange, and beyond that a dark mass of\ntrees.\n\nStill they pressed on without speaking; a dog barked not far off and\nthe cocks were crowing, and close by them in the meadow a cow lowed and\nwent hustling over the bents and the long, unbitten buttercups.  Day\ngrew apace, and by then they were under the barn-gable which he had\nseen aloof he saw the other roofs of the grange and heard the bleating\nof sheep.  And now he saw those six men clearly, and noted that one of\nthem was very big and tall, and one small and slender, and it came into\nhis mind that these two were none other than the twain whom he had come\nupon the last night sitting in the hall of the Flower de Luce.\n\nEven therewith came a man to the gate of the sheep-cote by the grange,\nand caught sight of them, and had the wits to run back at once shouting\nout: \"Hugh, Wat, Richard, and all ye, out with you, out a doors!  Here\nbe men!  Ware the Dry Tree!  Bows and bills!  Bows and bills!\"\n\nWith that those fellows of Ralph made no more ado, but set off running\nat their best toward the wood aforesaid, which crowned the slope\nleading up from the grange, and now took no care to go softly, nor\nheeded the clashing of their armour.  Ralph ran with the best and\nentered the wood alongside the slim youth aforesaid, who stayed not at\nthe wood's edge but went on running still: but Ralph stayed and turned\nto see what was toward, and beheld how that tall man was the last of\ntheir company, and ere he entered the wood turned about with a bent bow\nin his hand, and even as he nocked the shaft, the men from the Grange,\nwho were seven in all, came running out from behind the barn-gable,\ncrying out: \"Ho thieves! ho ye of the Dry Tree, abide till we come!\nflee not from handy strokes.\"  The tall man had the shaft to his ear in\na twinkling, and loosed straightway, and nocked and loosed another\nshaft without staying to note how the first had sped.  But Ralph saw\nthat a man was before each of the shafts, and had fallen to earth,\nthough he had no time to see aught else, for even therewith the tall\nman caught him by the hand, and crying out, \"The third time!\" ran on\nwith him after the rest of their company; and whereas he was\nlong-legged and Ralph lightfooted, they speedily came up with them, who\nwere running still, but laughing as they ran, and jeering at the men of\nthe Burg; and the tall man shouted out to them:  \"Yea, lads, the\ncounterfeit Dry Tree that they have raised in the Burg shall be dry\nenough this time.\" \"Truly,\" said another, \"till we come to water it\nwith the blood of these wretches.\"\n\n\"Well, well, get on,\" said a third, \"waste not your wind in talk; those\ncarles will make but a short run of it to the walls long as it was for\nus, creeping and creeping as we behoved to.\"\n\nThe long man laughed; \"Thou sayest sooth,\" said he, \"but thou art the\nlongest winded of all in talking: get on, lads.\"\n\nThey laughed again at his word and sped on with less noise; while Ralph\nthought within himself that he was come into strange company, for now\nhe knew well that the big man was even he whom he had first met at the\nchurchyard gate of the thorp under Bear Hill.  Yet he deemed that there\nwas nought for it now but to go on.\n\nWithin a while they all slacked somewhat, and presently did but walk,\nthough swiftly, through the paths of the thicket, which Ralph deemed\nfull surely was part of that side of the Wood Perilous that lay south\nof the Burg of the Four Friths.  And now Roger joined himself to him,\nand spake to him aloud and said: \"So, fair master, thou art out of the\nperil of death for this bout.\"\n\n\"Art thou all so sure of that?\" quoth Ralph, \"or who are these that be\nwith us? meseems they smell of the Dry Tree.\"\n\n\"Yea, or rebels and runaways therefrom,\" said Roger, with a dry grin.\n\"But whosoever they may be, thou shalt see that they will suffer us to\ndepart whither we will, if we like not their company.  I will be thy\nwarrant thereof.\"\n\n\"Moreover,\" said Ralph, \"I have lost Falcon my horse; it is a sore miss\nof him.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" quoth Roger, \"but at least thou hast saved thy skin; and\nwhereas there are many horses on the earth, there is but one skin of\nthine: be content; if thou wilt, thou shall win somewhat in exchange\nfor thine horse.\"\n\nRalph smiled, but somewhat sourly, and even therewith he heard a shrill\nwhistle a little aloof, and the men stayed and held their peace, for\nthey were talking together freely again now.  Then the big man put his\nfingers to his mouth and whistled again in answer, a third whistle\nanswered him; and lo, presently, as their company hastened on, the\nvoices of men, and anon they came into a little wood-lawn wherein\nstanding about or lying on the grass beside their horses were more than\na score of men well armed, but without any banner or token, and all in\nwhite armour with white Gaberdines thereover; and they had with them,\nas Ralph judged, some dozen of horses more than they needed for their\nown riding.\n\nGreat was the joy at this meeting, and there was embracing and kissing\nof friends:  but Ralph noted that no man embraced that slender youth,\nand that he held him somewhat aloof from the others, and all seemed to\ndo him reverence.\n\nNow spake one of the runaways:  \"Well, lads, here be all we four well\nmet again along with those twain who came to help us at our pinch, as\ntheir wont is, and Roger withal, good at need again, and a friend of\nhis, as it seemeth, and whom we know not.  See ye to that.\"\n\nThen stood forth the big man and said:  \"He is a fair young knight, as\nye may see; and he rideth seeking adventures, and Roger did us to wit\nthat he was abiding in the Burg at his peril, and would have him away,\neven if it were somewhat against his will:  and we were willing that it\nshould be so, all the more as I have a guess concerning what he is; and\na foreseeing man might think that luck should go with him.\" Therewith\nhe turned to Ralph and said:  \"How say ye, fair sir, will ye take\nguesting with us a while and learn our ways?\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Certain I am that whither ye will have me go, thither\nmust I; yet I deem that I have an errand that lies not your way.\nTherefore if I go with you, ye must so look upon it that I am in your\nfellowship as one compelled.  To be short with you, I crave leave to\ndepart and go mine own road.\"\n\nAs he spoke he saw the youth walking up and down in short turns; but\nhis face he could scarce see at all, what for his slouched hat, what\nfor his cloak; and at last he saw him go up to the tall man and speak\nsoftly to him awhile.  The tall man nodded his head, and as the youth\ndrew right back nigh to the thicket, spake to Ralph again.\n\n\"Fair sir, we grant thine asking; and add this thereto that we give\nthee the man who has joined himself to thee, Roger of the Rope-walk to\nwit, to help thee on the road, so that thou mayst not turn thy face\nback to the Burg of the Four Friths, where thine errand, and thy life\nwithal, were soon sped now, or run into any other trap which the Wood\nPerilous may have for thee.  And yet if thou think better of it, thou\nmayst come with us straightway; for we have nought to do to tarry here\nany longer.  And in any case, here is a good horse that we will give\nthee, since thou hast lost thy steed; and Roger who rideth with thee,\nhe also is well horsed.\"\n\nRalph looked hard at the big man, who now had his salade thrown back\nfrom his face, to see if he gave any token of jeering or malice, but\ncould see nought such:  nay, his face was grave and serious, not\nill-fashioned, though it were both long and broad like his body: his\ncheek-bones somewhat high, his eyes grey and middling great, and\nlooking, as it were, far away.\n\nNow deems Ralph that as for a trap of the Wood Perilous, he had already\nfallen into the trap; for he scarce needed to be told that these were\nmen of the Dry Tree.  He knew also that it was Roger who had led him\ninto this trap, although he deemed it done with no malice against him.\nSo he said to himself that if he went with Roger he but went a\nroundabout road to the Dry Tree; so that he was well nigh choosing to\ngo on with their company.  Yet again he thought that something might\nwell befall which would free him from that fellowship if he went with\nRoger alone; whereas if he went with the others it was not that he\nmight be, but that he was already of the fellowship of the Dry Tree,\nand most like would go straight thence to their stronghold.  So he\nspake as soberly as the tall man had done.\n\n\"Since ye give me the choice, fair sir, I will depart hence with Roger\nalone, whom ye call my man, though to me he seemeth to be yours.\nHowbeit, he has led me to you once, and belike will do so once more.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth the big man smiling no whit more than erst, \"and that will\nmake the fourth time.  Depart then, fair sir, and take this word with\nthee that I wish thee good and not evil.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nRalph Rideth the Wood Perilous Again\n\n\nNow Roger led up to Ralph a strong horse, red roan of hue, duly\nharnessed for war, and he himself had a good grey horse, and they\nmounted at once, and Ralph rode slowly away through the wood at his\nhorse's will, for he was pondering all that had befallen him, and\nwondering what next should hap.  Meanwhile those others had not\nloitered, but were a-horseback at once, and went their ways from Ralph\nthrough the wildwood.\n\nNought spake Ralph for a while till Roger came close up to him and\nsaid: \"Whither shall we betake us, fair lord? hast thou an inkling of\nthe road whereon lies thine errand?\"\n\nNow to Ralph this seemed but mockery, and he answered sharply: \"I wot\nnot, thou wilt lead whither thou wilt, even as thou hast trained me\nhitherward with lies and a forged tale.  I suppose thou wilt lead me\nnow by some roundabout road to the stronghold of the Dry Tree.  It\nmatters little, since thou durst not lead me back into the Burg.  Yet\nnow I come to think of it, it is evil to be alone with a found out\ntraitor and liar; and I had belike have done better to go with their\ncompany.\"\n\n\"Nay nay,\" quoth Roger, \"thou art angry, and I marvel not thereat; but\nlet thy wrath run off thee if thou mayest; for indeed what I have told\nthee of myself and my griefs is not all mere lying.  Neither was it any\nlie that thou wert in peril of thy life amongst those tyrants of the\nBurg; thou with thy manly bearing, and free tongue, and bred, as I\njudge, to hate cruel deeds and injustice.  Such freedom they cannot\naway with in that fellowship of hard men-at-arms; and soon hadst thou\ncome to harm amongst them.  And further, let alone that it is not ill\nto be sundered from yonder company, who mayhap will have rough work to\ndo or ever they win home, I have nought to do to bring thee to Hampton\nunder Scaur if thou hast no will to go thither: though certes I would\nlead thee some whither, whereof thou shalt ask me nought as now; yet\nwill I say thereof this much, that there thou shalt be both safe and\nwell at ease.  Now lastly know this, that whatever I have done, I have\ndone it to do thee good and not ill; and there is also another one,\nwhom I will not name to thee, who wisheth thee better yet, by the token\nof those two strokes stricken by thee in the Wood Perilous before\nyesterday was a day.\"\n\nNow when Ralph heard those last words, such strong and sweet hope and\ndesire stirred in him to see that woman of the Want-ways of the Wood\nPerilous that he forgat all else, except that he must nowise fall to\nstrife with Roger, lest they should sunder, and he should lose the help\nof him, which he now deemed would bring him to sight of her whom he had\nunwittingly come to long for more than aught else; so he spake to Roger\nquietly and humbly: \"Well, faring-fellow, thou seest how I am little\nmore than a lad, and have fallen into matters mighty and perilous,\nwhich I may not deal with of my own strength, at least until I get\nnigher to them so that I may look them in the eyes, and strike a stroke\nor two on them if they be at enmity with me.  So I bid thee lead me\nwhither thou wilt, and if thou be a traitor to me, on thine own head be\nit; in good sooth, since I know nought of this wood and since I might\ngo astray and so come back to the Burg where be those whom thou hast\nnow made my foemen, I am content to take thee on thy word, and to hope\nthe best of thee, and ask no question of thee, save whitherward.\"\n\n\"Fair sir,\" said Roger, \"away from this place at least; for we are as\nyet over nigh to the Burg to be safe: but as to elsewhither we may\nwend, thereof we may speak on the road as we have leisure.\"\n\nTherewith he smote his horse with his heel and they went forward at a\nsmart trot, for the horses were unwearied, and the wood thereabouts of\nbeech and clear of underwood; and Roger seemed to know his way well,\nand made no fumbling over it.\n\nFour hours or more gone, the wood thinned and the beeches failed, and\nthey came to a country, still waste, of little low hills, stony for the\nmore part, beset with scraggy thorn-bushes, and here and there some\nother berry-tree sown by the birds.  Then said Roger: \"Now I deem us\nwell out of the peril of them of the Burg, who if they follow the chase\nas far as the sundering of us and the others, will heed our slot\nnothing, but will follow on that of the company: so we may breathe our\nhorses a little, though their bait will be but small in this rough\nwaste:  therein we are better off than they, for lo you, saddle bags on\nmy nag and meat and drink therein.\"\n\nSo they lighted down and let their horses graze what they could, while\nthey ate and drank; amidst which Ralph again asked Roger of whither\nthey were going.  Said Roger:  \"I shall lead thee to a good harbour,\nand a noble house of a master of mine, wherein thou mayst dwell certain\ndays, if thou hast a mind thereto, not without solace maybe.\"\n\n\"And this master,\" said Ralph, \"is he of the Dry Tree?\" Said Roger:  \"I\nscarce know how to answer thee without lying: but this I say, that\nwhether he be or not, this is true; amongst those men I have friends\nand amongst them foes; but fate bindeth me to them for a while.\"  Said\nRalph reddening: \"Be there any women amongst them?\"  \"Yea, yea,\" quoth\nRoger, smiling a little, \"doubt not thereof.\"\n\n\"And that Lady of the Dry Tree,\" quoth Ralph, reddening yet more, but\nholding up his head, \"that woman whereof the Burgher spoke so bitterly,\nthreatening her with torments and death if they might but lay hold of\nher; what wilt thou tell me concerning her?\" \"But little,\" said Roger,\n\"save this, that thou desirest to see her, and that thou mayest have\nthy will thereon if thou wilt be guided by me.\"\n\nRalph hearkened as if he heeded little what Roger said; but presently\nhe rose up and walked to and fro in short turns with knit brows as one\npondering a hard matter.  He spake nought, and Roger seemed to heed him\nnothing, though in sooth he looked at him askance from time to time,\ntill at last he came and lay down again by Roger, and in a while he\nspake: \"I wot not why ye of the Dry Tree want me, or what ye will do\nwith me; and but for one thing I would even now ride away from thee at\nall adventure.\"\n\nRoger said:  \"All this ye shall learn later on, and shalt find it but a\nsimple matter; and meanwhile I tell thee again that all is for thy gain\nand thy pleasure.  So now ride away if thou wilt; who hindereth thee?\ncertes not I.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"I will ride with thee first to that fair house; and\nafterwards we shall see what is to hap.\"  \"Yea,\" quoth Roger, \"then let\nus to horse straightway, so that we may be there if not before dark\nnight yet at least before bright morn; for it is yet far away.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nRalph Cometh to the House of Abundance\n\n\nTherewithal they gat to horse and rode away through that stony land,\nwherein was no river, but for water many pools in the bottoms, with\nlittle brooks running from them.  But after a while they came upon a\nridge somewhat high, on the further side whereof was a wide valley\nwell-grassed and with few trees, and no habitation of man that they\nmight see.  But a wide river ran down the midst of it; and it was now\nfour hours after noon.  Quoth Roger:  \"The day wears and we shall by no\nmeans reach harbour before dark night, even if we do our best: art thou\nwell used to the water, lord?\"  \"Much as a mallard is,\" said Ralph.\nSaid Roger:  \"That is well, for though there is a ford some mile and a\nhalf down stream, for that same reason it is the way whereby men mostly\ncross the water into the wildwood; and here again we are more like to\nmeet foes than well-wishers; or at the least there will be question of\nwho we are, and whence and whither; and we may stumble in our answers.\"\nSaid Ralph: \"There is no need to tarry, ride we down to the water.\"\n\nSo did they, and took the water, which was deep, but not swift.  On the\nfurther side they clomb up a hill somewhat steep; at the crown they\ndrew rein to give their horses breath, and Ralph turned in his saddle\nand looked down on to the valley, and as aforesaid he was clear-sighted\nand far-sighted; now he said: \"Fellow-farer, I see the riding of folk\ndown below there, and meseems they be spurring toward the water; and\nthey have weapons: there! dost thou not see the gleam?\"\n\n\"I will take thy word for it, fair sir,\" said Roger, \"and will even\nspur, since they be the first men whom we have seen since we left the\nthickets.\" And therewith he went off at a hand gallop, and Ralph\nfollowed him without more ado.\n\nThey rode up hill and down dale of a grassy downland, till at last they\nsaw a wood before them again, and soon drew rein under the boughs; for\nnow were their horses somewhat wearied.  Then said Ralph:  \"Here have\nwe ridden a fair land, and seen neither house nor herd, neither\nsheep-cote nor shepherd.  I wonder thereat.\"\n\nSaid Roger:  \"Thou wouldst wonder the less didst thou know the story of\nit.\" \"What story?\" said Ralph.  Quoth Roger:  \"A story of war and\nwasting.\" \"Yea?\" said Ralph, \"yet surely some bold knight or baron hath\nrights in the land, and might be free to build him a strong house and\ngather men to him to guard the shepherds and husbandmen from burners\nand lifters.\" \"Sooth is that,\" said Roger; \"but there are other things\nin the tale.\" \"What things?\" said Ralph.  Quoth Roger:  \"Ill hap and\nsorrow and the Hand of Fate and great Sorcery.\"  \"And dastards withal?\"\nsaid Ralph.  \"Even so,\" said Roger, \"yet mingled with valiant men.\nOver long is the tale to tell as now, so low as the sun is; so now ride\nwe on with little fear of foemen.  For look you, this wood, like the\nthickets about the Burg of the Four Friths, hath an evil name, and few\nfolk ride it uncompelled; therefore it is the safer for us.  And yet I\nwill say this to thee, that whereas awhile agone thou mightest have\ndeparted from me with little peril of aught save the stumbling on some\nof the riders of the Burg of the Four Friths, departing from me now\nwill be a hard matter to thee; for the saints in Heaven only know\nwhitherward thou shouldest come, if thou wert to guide thyself now.\nThis a rough word, but a true one, so help me God and Saint Michael!\nWhat sayest thou; art thou content, or wilt thou cast hard words at me\nagain?\"\n\nSo it was that for all that had come and gone Ralph was light-hearted\nand happy; so he laughed and said: \"Content were I, even if I were not\ncompelled thereto.  For my heart tells me of new things, and marvellous\nand joyous that I shall see ere long.\"\n\n\"And thine heart lieth not,\" said Roger, \"for amidst of this wood is\nthe house where we shall have guesting to-night, which will be to thee,\nbelike, the door of life and many marvels.  For thence have folk sought\nere now to the WELL AT THE WORLD'S END.\"\n\nRalph turned to him sharply and said:  \"Many times in these few days\nhave I heard that word.  Dost thou know the meaning thereof?  For as to\nme I know it not.\"  Said Roger:  \"Thou mayest well be as wise as I am\nthereon: belike men seek to it for their much thriving, and oftenest\nfind it not.  Yet have I heard that they be the likeliest with whom all\nwomen are in love.\"\n\nRalph held his peace, but Roger noted that he reddened at the word.\n\nNow they got on horseback again, for they had lighted down to breathe\ntheir beasts, and they rode on and on, and never was Roger at fault:\nlong was the way and perforce they rested at whiles, so that night fell\nupon them in the wood, but the moon rose withal.  So night being fairly\ncome, they rested a good while, as it would be dawn before moonset.\nThen they rode on again, till now the summer night grew old and waned,\nbut the wood hid the beginnings of dawn.\n\nAt last they came out of the close wood suddenly into an open plain,\nand now, as the twilight of the dawn was passing into early day, they\nsaw that wide grassy meadows and tilled fields lay before them, with a\nlittle river running through the plain; and amidst the meadows, on a\ngreen mound, was a white castle, strong, and well built, though not of\nthe biggest.\n\nRoger pointed to it, and said, \"Now we are come home,\" and cried on his\nwearied beast, who for his part seemed to see the end of his journey.\nThey splashed through a ford of the river and came to the gate of the\ncastle as day drew on apace; Roger blew a blast on a great horn that\nhung on the gate, and Ralph looking round deemed he had never seen\nfairer building than in the castle, what he could see of it, and yet it\nwas built from of old.  They waited no long while before they were\nanswered; but whereas Ralph looked to see armed gatewards peer from the\nbattlements or the shot window, and a porter espying them through a\nlattice, it happened in no such way, but without more ado the wicket\nwas opened to them by a tall old woman, gaunt and grey, who greeted\nthem courteously: Roger lighted down and Ralph did in likewise, and\nthey led their horses through the gate into the court of the castle;\nthe old woman going before them till they came to the hall door, which\nshe opened to them, and taking the reins of their horses led them away\nto the stable, while those twain entered the hall, which was as goodly\nas might be.  Roger led Ralph up to a board on the dais, whereon there\nwas meat and drink enow, and Ralph made his way-leader sit down by him,\nand they fell to.  There was no serving-man to wait on them nor a carle\nof any kind did they see; the old woman only, coming back from the\nhorses, served them at table.  Ever as she went about she looked long\non Ralph, and seemed as if she would have spoken to him, but as often,\nshe glanced at Roger and forbore.\n\nSo when they were well nigh done with their meat Ralph spake to the\ncarline and said:  \"Belike the lord or the lady of this house are abed\nand we shall not see them till the morrow?\"\n\nEre the carline could speak Roger broke in and said: \"There is neither\nlord nor lady in the castle as now, nor belike will there be to-morrow\nmorning, or rather, before noon on this day; so now ye were better to\nlet this dame lead thee to bed, and let the next hours take care of\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Ralph, who was by this time heartily wearied, \"shall\nwe two lie in the same chamber?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the carline shortly, \"lodging for the master and lodging\nfor the man are two different things.\"\n\nRoger laughed and said nought, and Ralph gave him good night, and\nfollowed the carline nothing loth, who led him to a fair chamber over\nthe solar, as if he had been the very master of the castle, and he lay\ndown in a very goodly bed, nor troubled himself as to where Roger lay,\nnor indeed of aught else, nor did he dream of Burg, or wood, or castle,\nor man, or woman; but lay still like the image of his father's father\non the painted tomb in the choir of St. Laurence of Upmeads.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nOf Ralph in the Castle of Abundance\n\n\nBroad lay the sun upon the plain amidst the wildwood when he awoke and\nsprang out of bed and looked out of the window (for the chamber was in\nthe gable of the hall and there was nought of the castle beyond it). It\nwas but little after noon of a fair June day, for Ralph had slumbered\nas it behoved a young man.  The light wind bore into the chamber the\nsweet scents of the early summer, the chief of all of them being the\nsavour of the new-cut grass, for about the wide meadows the carles and\nqueens were awork at the beginning of hay harvest; and late as it was\nin the day, more than one blackbird was singing from the bushes of the\ncastle pleasance.  Ralph sighed for very pleasure of life before he had\nyet well remembered where he was or what had befallen of late; but as\nhe stood at the window and gazed over the meadows, and the memory of\nall came back to him, he sighed once more for a lack of somewhat that\ncame into his heart, and he smiled shamefacedly, though there was no\none near, as his thought bade him wonder if amongst the haymaking women\nyonder there were any as fair as those yellow-clad thrall-women of the\nBurg; and as he turned from the window a new hope made his heart beat,\nfor he deemed that he had been brought to that house that he might meet\nsome one who should change his life and make him a new man.\n\nSo he did on his raiment and went his ways down to the hall, and looked\nabout for Roger, but found him not, nor any one else save the carline,\nwho presently came in from the buttery, and of whom he asked, where was\nRoger.  Quoth she:  \"He has been gone these six hours, but hath left a\nword for thee, lord, to wit, that he beseeches thee to abide him here\nfor two days at the least, and thereafter thou art free to go if thou\nwilt.  But as for me\" (and therewith she smiled on him as sweetly as\nher wrinkled old face might compass) \"I say to thee, abide beyond those\ntwo days if Roger cometh not, and as long as thou art here I will make\nthee all the cheer I may.  And who knoweth but thou mayest meet worthy\nadventures here.  Such have ere now befallen good knights in this house\nor anigh it.\"\n\n\"I thank thee, mother,\" quoth Ralph, \"and it is like that I may abide\nhere beyond the two days if the adventure befall me not ere then.  But\nat least I will bide the eating of my dinner here to-day.\"\n\n\"Well is thee, fair lord,\" said the carline.  \"If thou wilt but walk in\nthe meadow but a little half hour all shall be ready for thee.\nForsooth it had been dight before now, but that I waited thy coming\nforth from thy chamber, for I would not wake thee.  And the saints be\npraised for the long sweet sleep that hath painted thy goodly cheeks.\"\nSo saying she hurried off to the buttery, leaving Ralph laughing at her\noutspoken flattering words.\n\nThen he got him out of the hall and the castle, for no door was shut,\nand there was no man to be seen within or about the house.  So he\nwalked to and fro the meadow and saw the neat-herds in the pasture, and\nthe hay-making folk beyond them, and the sound of their voices came to\nhim on the little airs that were breathing.  He thought he would talk\nto some of these folk ere the world was much older, and also he noted\nbetween the river and the wood many cots of the husbandmen trimly\nbuilded and thatched, and amidst them a little church, white and\ndelicate of fashion; but as now his face was set toward the river\nbecause of the hot day.  He came to a pool a little below where a\nwooden foot-bridge crossed the water, and about the pool were willows\ngrowing, which had not been shrouded these eight years, and the water\nwas clear as glass with a bottom of fine sand.  There then he bathed\nhim, and as he sported in the water he bethought him of the long smooth\nreaches of Upmeads Water, and the swimming low down amidst the long\nswinging weeds between the chuckle of the reed sparrows, when the sun\nwas new risen in the July morning.  When he stood on the grass again,\nwhat with the bright weather and fair little land, what with the\nfreshness of the water, and his good rest, and the hope of adventure to\ncome, he felt as if he had never been merrier in his life-days. Withal\nit was a weight off his heart that he had escaped from the turmoil of\nthe wars of the Burg of the Four Friths, and the men of the Dry Tree,\nand the Wheat-wearers, with the thralldom and stripes and fire-raising,\nand the hard life of strife and gain of the walled town and strong\nplace.\n\nWhen he came back to the castle gate there was the carline in the\nwicket peering out to right and left, seeking him to bring him in to\ndinner.  And when she saw him so joyous, with his lips smiling and his\neyes dancing for mirth, she also became joyous, and said:  \"Verily, it\nis a pity of thee that there is never a fair damsel or so to look on\nthee and love thee here to-day. Far would many a maiden run to kiss thy\nmouth, fair lad.  But now come to thy meat, that thou mayest grow the\nfairer and last the longer.\"\n\nHe laughed gaily and went into the hall with her, and now was it well\ndight with bankers and dorsars of goodly figured cloth, and on the\nwalls a goodly halling of arras of the Story of Alexander.  So he sat\nto table, and the meat and drink was of the best, and the carline\nserved him, praising him ever with fulsome words as he ate, till he\nwished her away.\n\nAfter dinner he rested awhile, and called to the carline and bade her\nbring him his sword and his basnet.  \"Wherefore?\" said she.  \"Whither\nwilt thou?\"\n\nSaid he, \"I would walk abroad to drink the air.\"\n\n\"Wilt thou into the wildwood?\" said she.\n\n\"Nay, mother,\" he said, \"I will but walk about the meadow and look on\nthe hay-making folk.\"\n\n\"For that,\" said the carline, \"thou needest neither sword nor helm.  I\nwas afeard that thou wert about departing, and thy departure would be a\ngrief to my heart:  in the deep wood thou mightest be so bestead as to\nneed a sword in thy fist; but what shouldst thou do with it in this\nPlain of Abundance, where are nought but peaceful husbandmen and frank\nand kind maidens? and all these are as if they had drunk a draught of\nthe WELL AT THE WORLD'S END.\"\n\nRalph started as she said the word, but held his peace awhile.  Then he\nsaid:  \"And who is lord of this fair land?\" \"There is no lord, but a\nlady,\" said the carline.  \"How hight she?\" said Ralph.  \"We call her\nthe Lady of Abundance,\" said the old woman.  Said Ralph:  \"Is she a\ngood lady?\" \"She is my lady,\" said the carline, \"and doeth good to me,\nand there is not a carle in the land but speaketh well of her--it may\nbe over well.\"  \"Is she fair to look on?\" said Ralph.  \"Of women-folk\nthere is none fairer,\" said the carline; \"as to men, that is another\nthing.\"\n\nRalph was silent awhile, then he said:  \"What is the Well at the\nWorld's End?\"\n\n\"They talk of it here,\" said she, \"many things too long to tell of now:\nbut there is a book in this house that telleth of it; I know it well by\nthe look of it though I may not read in it.  I will seek it for thee\nto-morrow if thou wilt.\"\n\n\"Have thou thanks, dame,\" said he; \"and I pray thee forget it not; but\nnow I will go forth.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the carline, \"but abide a little.\"\n\nTherewith she went into the buttery, and came back bearing with her a\ngarland of roses of the garden, intermingled with green leaves, and she\nsaid:  \"The sun is yet hot and over hot, do this on thine head to shade\nthee from the burning.  I knew that thou wouldst go abroad to-day, so I\nmade this for thee in the morning; and when I was young I was called\nthe garland-maker. It is better summer wear than thy basnet.\"\n\nHe thanked her and did it on smiling, but somewhat ruefully; for he\nsaid to himself:  \"This is over old a dame that I should wear a\nlove-token from her.\"  But when it was on his head, the old dame\nclapped her hands and cried:  \"O there, there!  Now art thou like the\nimage of St. Michael in the Choir of Our Lady of the Thorn: there is\nnone so lovely as thou.  I would my Lady could see thee thus; surely\nthe sight of thee should gladden her heart.  And withal thou art not\nill clad otherwise.\"\n\nIndeed his raiment was goodly, for his surcoat was new, and it was of\nfine green cloth, and the coat-armour of Upmead was beaten on it, to\nwit, on a gold ground an apple-tree fruited, standing by a river-side.\n\nNow he laughed somewhat uneasily at her words, and so went forth from\nthe castle again, and made straight for the hay-making folk on the\nother side of the water; for all this side was being fed by beasts and\nsheep; but at the point where he crossed, the winding of the stream\nbrought it near to the castle gate.  So he came up with the country\nfolk and greeted them, and they did as much by him in courteous words:\nthey were goodly and well-shapen, both men and women, gay and joyous of\ndemeanour and well clad as for folk who work afield.  So Ralph went\nfrom one to another and gave them a word or two, and was well pleased\nto watch them at their work awhile; but yet he would fain speak\nsomewhat more with one or other of them.  At last under the shade of a\ntall elm-tree he saw an old man sitting heeding the outer raiment of\nthe haymakers and their victual and bottles of drink; and he came up to\nhim and gave him the sele of the day; and the old man blessed him and\nsaid: \"Art thou dwelling in my lady's castle, fair lord?\" \"A while at\nleast,\" said Ralph.  Said the old man: \"We thank thee for coming to see\nus; and meseemeth from the look of thee thou art worthy to dwell in my\nLady's House.\"\n\n\"What sayest thou?\" said Ralph.  \"Is she a good lady and a gracious?\"\n\"O yea, yea,\" said the carle.  Said Ralph:  \"Thou meanest, I suppose,\nthat she is fair to look on, and soft-spoken when she is pleased?\"\n\n\"I mean far more than that,\" said the carle; \"surely is she most\nheavenly fair, and her voice is like the music of heaven: but withal\nher deeds, and the kindness of her to us poor men and husbandmen, are\nno worse than should flow forth from that loveliness.\"\n\n\"Will you be her servants?\" said Ralph, \"or what are ye?\"  Said the\ncarle: \"We be yeomen and her vavassors; there is no thralldom in our\nland.\" \"Do ye live in good peace for the more part?\" said Ralph.  Said\nthe carle:  \"Time has been when cruel battles were fought in these\nwood-lawns, and many poor people were destroyed therein: but that was\nbefore the coming of the Lady of Abundance.\"\n\n\"And when was that?\" said Ralph.  \"I wot not,\" said the old carle; \"I\nwas born in peace and suckled in peace; and in peace I fell to the\nloving of maidens, and I wedded in peace, and begat children in peace,\nand in peace they dwell about me, and in peace shall I depart.\"\n\n\"What then,\" said Ralph (and a grievous fear was born in his heart),\n\"is not the Lady of Abundance young?\"  Said the carle: \"I have seen her\nwhen I was young and also since I have been old, and ever was she fair\nand lovely, and slender handed, as straight as a spear, and as sweet as\nwhite clover, and gentle-voiced and kind, and dear to our souls.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and she doth not dwell in this castle always; where\nelse then doth she dwell?\"  \"I wot not,\" said the carle, \"but it should\nbe in heaven:  for when she cometh to us all our joys increase in us by\nthe half.\"\n\n\"Look you, father,\" said Ralph, \"May it not have been more than one\nLady of Abundance that thou hast seen in thy life-days; and that this\none that now is, is the daughter's daughter of the one whom thou first\nsawest--how sayest thou?\"  The carle laughed:  \"Nay, nay,\" said he,\n\"It is not so: never has there been another like to her in all ways, in\nbody and voice, and heart and soul.  It is as I say, she is the same as\nshe was always.\" \"And when,\" said Ralph, with a beating heart, \"does\nshe come hither?  Is it at some set season?\"  \"Nay, from time to time,\nat all seasons,\" said the carle; \"and as fair she is when she goeth\nover the snow, as when her feet are set amidst the June daisies.\"\n\nNow was Ralph so full of wonder that he scarce knew what to say; but he\nbethought him of that fair waste on the other side of the forest, the\ncountry through which that wide river flowed, so he said: \"And that\nland north-away beyond the wildwood, canst thou tell me the tale of its\nwars, and if it were wasted in the same wars that tormented this land?\"\nThe carle shook his head: \"As to the land beyond this wood,\" quoth he,\n\"I know nought of it, for beyond the wood go we never:  nay, most often\nwe go but a little way into it, no further than we can see the glimmer\nof the open daylight through its trees,--the daylight of the land of\nAbundance--that is enough for us.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ralph, \"I thank thee for the tale thou hast told me, and\nwish thee more years of peace.\"\n\n\"And to thee, young man,\" said the carle, \"I wish a good wish indeed,\nto wit that thou mayest see the Lady of Abundance here before thou\ndepartest.\"\n\nHis words once more made Ralph's heart beat and his cheek flush, and he\nwent back to the castle somewhat speedily; for he said to himself,\nafter the folly of lovers, \"Maybe she will be come even now, and I not\nthere to meet her.\"  Yet when he came to the castle-gate his heart\nmisgave him, and he would not enter at once, but turned about to go\nround the wall by the north and west.  In the castle he saw no soul\nsave the old dame looking out of the window and nodding to him, but in\nthe pasture all about were neatherds and shepherds, both men and women;\nand at the north-west corner, whereas the river drew quite close to the\nwall, he came upon two damsels of the field-folk fishing with an angle\nin a quiet pool of the stream.  He greeted them, and they, who were\nyoung and goodly, returned his greeting, but were shamefaced at his\ngallant presence, as indeed was he at the thoughts of his heart mingled\nwith the sight of their fairness.  So he passed on at first without\nmore words than his greeting.  Yet presently he turned back again, for\nhe longed to hear some word more concerning the Lady whose coming he\nabode.  They stood smiling and blushing as he came up to them again,\nand heeded their angles little.\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Fair maidens, do ye know at all when the Lady of the\ncastle may be looked for?\"  They were slow to answer, but at last one\nsaid: \"No, fair sir, such as we know nothing of the comings and goings\nof great folk.\"\n\nSaid Ralph, smiling on her for kindness, and pleasure of her fairness:\n\"Is it not so that ye will be glad of her coming?\"\n\nBut she answered never a word, only looked at him steadily, with her\ngreat grey eyes fixed in wonderment, while the other one looked down as\nif intent on her angling tools.\n\nRalph knew not how to ask another question, so he turned about with a\ngreeting word again, and this time went on steadily round about the\nwall.\n\nAnd now in his heart waxed the desire of that Lady, once seen, as he\ndeemed, in such strange wise; but he wondered within himself if the\ndevil had not sown that longing within him: whereas it might be that\nthis woman on whom he had set his heart was herself no real woman but a\ndevil, and one of the goddesses of the ancient world, and his heart was\nsore and troubled by many doubts and hopes and fears; but he said to\nhimself that when he saw her then could he judge between the good and\nthe evil, and could do or forbear, and that the sight of her would cure\nall.\n\nThus thinking he walked swiftly, and was soon round at the castle gate\nagain, and entered, and went into the hall, where was the old dame,\nbusied about some household matter.  Ralph nodded to her and hastened\naway, lest she should fall to talk with him; and he set himself now to\ngo from chamber to chamber, that he might learn the castle, what it\nwas.  He came into the guard-chamber and found the walls thereof all\nhung with armour and weapons, clean and in good order, though there was\nnever a man-at-arms there, nor any soul except the old woman.  He went\nup a stair therefrom on to the battlements, and went into the towers of\nthe wall, and found weapons both for hand, and for cast and shot in\neach one of them, and all ready as if for present battle; then he came\ndown into the court again and went into a very goodly ambulatory over\nagainst the hall, and he entered a door therefrom, which was but on the\nlatch, and went up a little stair into a chamber, which was the\ngoodliest and the richest of all.  Its roof was all done with gold and\nblue from over sea, and its pavement wrought delicately in Alexandrine\nwork.  On the dais was a throne of carven ivory, and above it a canopy\nof baudekin of the goodliest fashion, and there was a foot-carpet\nbefore it, wrought with beasts and the hunting of the deer.  As for the\nwalls of that chamber, they were hung with a marvellous halling of\narras, wherein was wrought the greenwood, and there amidst in one place\na pot-herb garden, and a green garth with goats therein, and in that\ngarth a little thatched house.  And amidst all this greenery were\nfigured over and over again two women, whereof one old and the other\nyoung; and the old one was clad in grand attire, with gold chains and\nbrooches and rings, and sat with her hands before her by the house\ndoor, or stood looking on as the young one worked, spinning or digging\nin the garth, or milking the goats outside of it, or what not; and this\none was clad in sorry and scanty raiment.\n\nWhat all this might mean Ralph knew not; but when he had looked long at\nthe greenery and its images, he said to himself that if he who wrought\nthat cloth had not done the young woman after the likeness of the Lady\nwhom he had helped in the wildwood, then it must have been done from\nher twin sister.\n\nLong he abode in that chamber looking at the arras, and wondering\nwhether the sitter in the ivory throne would be any other than the\nthrall in the greenwood cot.  He abode there so long that the dusk\nbegan to gather in the house, and he could see the images no more; for\nhe was filled with the sweetness of desire when he looked on them.\n\nThen he went back slowly to the hall, and found the carline, who had\nlighted the waxlights and made meat ready for him; and when she saw him\nshe cried out joyously:  \"Ah, I knew that thou wouldst come back.  Art\nthou well content with our little land?\"\n\n\"I like it well, dame,\" said he; \"but tell me, if thou canst, what is\nthe meaning of the halling in the chamber with the ivory throne?\"\n\nSaid the carline:  \"Thereof shall another tell thee, who can tell of it\nbetter than I; but it is nought to hide that yonder chamber is the\nchamber of estate of our Lady, and she sitteth there to hear the cases\nof folk and to give dooms.\"\n\nThe old woman crossed herself as she spoke, and Ralph wondered thereat,\nbut asked no more questions, for he was scarce sorry that the carline\nwould not tell him thereof, lest she should spoil the tale.\n\nSo passed the evening, and he went to bed and slept as a young man\nshould, and the next day he was up betimes and went abroad and mingled\nwith the carles and queens afield; but this time he spake not of the\nLady, and heard nought to heed from any of that folk.  So he went back\nto the castle and gat him a bow and arrows, and entered the thicket of\nthe wood nigh where he and Roger first came out of it.  He had prayed a\nyoung man of the folk to go with him, but he was not over willing to\ngo, though he would not say wherefore.  So Ralph went himself by\nhimself and wandered some way into the wood, and saw nought worse than\nhimself.  As he came back, making a circuit toward the open meadows, he\nhappened on a herd of deer in a lonely place, half wood half meadow,\nand there he slew a hart with one shaft, for he was a deft bowman.\nThen he went and fetched a leash of carles, who went with him somewhat\nless than half willingly, and between them they broke up the hart and\ncarried him home to the castle, where the carline met them.  She smiled\non Ralph and praised the venison, and said withal that the hunting was\nwell done; \"For, as fond and as fair as thou mayst be, it is not good\nthat young men should have their minds set on one thing only.\"\nTherewith she led him in to his meat, and set him down and served him;\nand all the while of his dinner he was longing to ask her if she deemed\nthat the Lady would come that day, since it was the last day of those\nwhich Roger had bidden him wait; but the words would not out of his\nmouth.\n\nShe looked at him and smiled, as though she had a guess of his thought,\nand at last she said to him:  \"Thy tongue is tied to-day. Hast thou,\nafter all, seen something strange in the wood?\"  He shook his head for\nnaysay.  Said she:  \"Why, then, dost thou not ask more concerning the\nWell at the World's End?\"\n\nHe laughed, and said:  \"Maybe because I think that thou canst not tell\nme thereof.\"  \"Well,\" she said, \"if I cannot, yet the book may, and\nthis evening, when the sun is down, thou shalt have it.\"\n\n\"I thank thee, mother,\" said he; \"but this is now the last day that\nRoger bade me wait.  Dost thou think that he will come back to-night?\"\nand he reddened therewith.  \"Nay,\" she said, \"I know not, and thou\ncarest not whether he will come or not.  Yet I know that thou wilt\nabide here till some one else come, whether that be early or late.\"\nAgain he reddened, and said, in a coaxing way:  \"And wilt thou give me\nguesting, mother, for a few more summer days?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"and till summer is over, if need be, and the corn is\ncut and carried, and till the winter is come and the latter end of\nwinter is gone.\"  He smiled faintly, though his heart fell, and he\nsaid: \"Nay, mother, and can it by any chance be so long a-coming?\"\n\n\"O, fair boy,\" she said, \"thou wilt make it long, howsoever short it\nbe.  And now I will give thee a rede, lest thou vex thyself sick and\nfret thy very heart.  To-morrow go see if thou canst meet thy fate\ninstead of abiding it.  Do on thy war-gear and take thy sword and try\nthe adventure of the wildwood; but go not over deep into it.\"  Said he:\n\"But how if the Lady come while I am away from this house?\"\n\n\"Sooth to say,\" said the carline, \"I deem not that she will, for the\nway is long betwixt us and her.\"\n\n\"Dost thou mean,\" said Ralph, standing up from the board, \"that she\nwill not come ever?  I adjure thee not to beguile me with soft words,\nbut tell me the very sooth.\" \"There, there!\" said she, \"sit down,\nking's son; eat thy meat and drink thy wine; for to-morrow is a new\nday.  She will come soon or late, if she be yet in the world.  And now\nI will say no more to thee concerning this matter.\"\n\nTherewith she went her ways from the hall, and when she came back with\nhand-basin and towel, she said no word to him, but only smiled kindly.\nHe went out presently into the meadow (for it was yet but early\nafternoon) and came among the haymaking folk and spake with them,\nhoping that perchance some of them might speak again of the Lady of\nAbundance; but none of them did so, though the old carle he had spoken\nwith was there, and there also were the two maidens whom he had seen\nfishing; and as for him, he was over faint-hearted to ask them any more\nquestions concerning her.\n\nYet he abode with them long, and ate and drank amidst the hay with them\ntill the moon shone brightly.  Then he went back to the castle and\nfound the carline in the hall, and she had the book with her and gave\nit to him, and he sat down in the shot-window under the waxlights and\nfell to reading of it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nRalph Readeth in a Book Concerning the Well at the World's End\n\n\nFairly written was that book, with many pictures therein, the meaning\nof which Ralph knew not; but amongst them was the image of the fair\nwoman whom he had holpen at the want-ways of the wood, and but four\ndays ago was that, yet it seemed long and long to him.  The book told\nnot much about the Well at the World's End, but much it told of a\ncertain woman whom no man that saw her could forbear to love:  of her\nit told that erewhile she dwelt lonely in the wildwood (though how she\ncame there was not said) and how a king's son found her there and\nbrought her to his father's kingdom and wedded her, whether others were\nlief or loth: and in a little while, when the fame of her had spread,\nhe was put out of his kingdom and his father's house for the love of\nher, because other kings and lords hankered after her; whereof befel\nlong and grievous war which she abode not to the end, but sought to her\nold place in the wildwood; and how she found there another woman a\nsorceress, who made her her thrall; and tormented her grievously with\ntoil and stripes.  And how again there came a knight to that place who\nwas seeking the Well at the World's End, and bore her away with him;\nand how the said knight was slain on the way, and she was taken by\ntyrants and robbers of the folk: but these being entangled in her love\nfought amongst themselves and she escaped, and went seeking that Well,\nand found it at the long last, and drank thereof, and throve ever\nafter: and how she liveth yet, and is become the servant of the Well to\nentangle the seekers in her love and keep them from drinking thereof;\nbecause there was no man that beheld her, but anon he was the thrall of\nher love, and might not pluck his heart away from her to do any of the\ndeeds whereby men thrive and win the praise of the people.\n\nRalph read on and on till the short night waned, and the wax-lights\nfailed one after the other, and the windows of the hall grew grey and\ndaylight came, and the throstles burst out a-singing at once in the\ncastle pleasaunce, and the sun came up over the wood, and the sound of\nmen-folk bestirring themselves a-field came to his ears through the\nopen windows; and at last he was done with the tale, and the carline\ncame not near him though the sun had clomb high up the heavens.  As for\nRalph, what he had read was sweet poison to him; for if before he was\nsomewhat tormented by love, now was his heart sick and sore with it.\nThough he knew not for certain whether this tale had to do with the\nLady of the Forest, and though he knew not if the Lady who should come\nto the castle were even she, yet he needs must deem that so it was, and\nhis heart was weary with love, and his manhood seemed changed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nRalph Meeteth a Man in the Wood\n\n\nBut the morning began to wear as he sat deep in these thoughts and\nstill the Carline came not to him; and he thought: \"She leaveth me\nalone that I may do her bidding: so will I without tarrying.\"  And he\narose and did on his hauberk and basnet, and girt his sword to his\nside, and went forth, a-foot as before.  He crossed the river by a wide\nford and stepping stones somewhat below the pool wherein he had bathed\non that first day; and already by then he had got so far, what with the\nfresh air of the beauteous morning, what with the cheerful tinkling of\nhis sword and hauberk, he was somewhat amended of his trouble and\nheaviness of spirit.  A little way across the river, but nigher to the\nwood, was a house or cot of that country-folk, and an old woman sat\nspinning in the door.  So Ralph went up thither, and greeted her, and\ncraved of her a draught of milk; so the goody turned about and cried\nout to one within, and there came forth one of the maidens whom Ralph\nhad met fishing that other day, and the old woman bade her bring forth\nmilk and bread.  Then the carline looked hard at Ralph, and said:  \"Ah!\nI have heard tell of thee:  thou art abiding the turn of the days up at\nthe castle yonder, as others have done before thee.  Well, well, belike\nthou shalt have thy wish, though whether it shall be to thy profit, who\nshall say?\"\n\nThereat Ralph's heart fell again, and he said:  \"Sayest thou, mother,\nthat there have been others abiding like me in the tower?  I know not\nwhat thy words mean.\"\n\nThe carline laughed.  \"Well,\" said she, \"here comes thy morning's bait\nborne by shapely hands enough; eat and drink first; and then will I\ntell thee my meaning.\"\n\nTherewith came the maiden forth with the bowl and the loaf; and indeed\nshe was fair enough, and shy and kind; but Ralph heeded her little, nor\nwas his heart moved by her at all.  She set a stool for him beside the\ndoor and he sat down and ate and drank, though his heart was troubled;\nand the maiden hung about, and seemed to find it no easy matter to keep\nher eyes off him.\n\nPresently the carline, who had been watching the two, said: \"Thou\naskest of the meaning of my words; well, deemest thou that I have had\nmore men than one to love me?\"  \"I know not, mother,\" said Ralph, who\ncould scarce hold himself patient.  \"There now!\" quoth the carline,\n\"look at my damsel! (she is not my daughter, but my brother's,) there\nis a man, and a brisk lad too, whom she calleth her batchelor, and is\nas I verily deem well-pleased with him: yet lo you how she eyeth thee,\nthou fair man, and doth so with her raiment that thou mayst best see\nhow shapely she is of limb and foot, and toyeth her right hand with her\nleft wrist, and the like.--Well, as for me, I have had more lovers than\none or two.  And why have I had just so many and no more?  Nay, thou\nneedest not make any long answer to me.  I am old now, and even before\nI was old I was not young: I am now foul of favour, and even before I\nbecame foul, I was not so fair--well then?\"\n\n\"Yea, what then?\" said Ralph.  \"This then, fair young fool,\" said she:\n\"the one whom thou lovest, long hath she lived, but she is not old to\nlook on, nor foul; but fair--O how fair!\"\n\nThen Ralph forgot his fear, and his heart grew greedy and his eyes\nglistened, and he said, yet he spoke faintly: \"Yea, is she fair?\"\n\"What! hast thou not seen her?\" said the carline.  Ralph called to mind\nthe guise in which he had seen her and flushed bright red, as he\nanswered:  \"Yea, I deem that I have: surely it was she.\"  The carline\nlaughed:  \"Well,\" said she; \"however thou hast seen her, thou hast\nscarce seen her as I have.\" Said Ralph, \"How was that?\"  Said she:  \"It\nis her way here in the summer-tide to bathe her in yonder pool up the\nwater:\" (and it was the same pool wherein Ralph had bathed) \"And she\nhath me and my niece and two other women to hold up the silken cloth\nbetwixt her body and the world; so that I have seen her as God made\nher; and I shall tell thee that when he was about that work he was\nminded to be a craftsmaster; for there is no blemish about her that she\nshould hide her at all or anywhere.  Her sides are sleek, and her\nthighs no rougher than her face, and her feet as dainty as her hands:\nyea, she is a pearl all over, withal she is as strong as a knight, and\nI warrant her hardier of heart than most knights.  A happy man shalt\nthou be; for surely I deem thou hast not come hither to abide her\nwithout some token or warrant of her.\"\n\nRalph held down his head, and he could not meet the old woman's eyes as\nshe spake thus; and the maiden took herself out of earshot at the first\nwords of the carline hereof, and was halfway down to the river by now.\n\nRalph spake after a while and said:  \"Tell me, is she good, and a good\nwoman?\"  The dame laughed scornfully and said: \"Surely, surely; she is\nthe saint of the Forest Land, and the guardian of all poor folk.  Ask\nthe carles else!\"\n\nRalph held his peace, and rose to be gone and turning saw the damsel\nwading the shallow ford, and looking over her shoulder at him.  He gave\nthe dame good day, and departed light-foot but heavy hearted.  Yet as\nhe went, he kept saying to himself:  \"Did she not send that Roger to\nturn my ways hither? yet she cometh not.  Surely she hath changed in\nthese last days, or it may be in these last hours: yea, or this very\nhour.\"\n\nAmidst such thoughts he came into the wood, and made his way by the\npaths and open places, going south and east of the House: whereas the\nlast day he had gone west and north.  He went a soft pace, but wandered\non without any stay till it was noon, and he had seen nought but the\nwild things of the wood, nor many of them.  But at last he heard the\ntinkle of a little bell coming towards him: so he stood still and got\nthe hilt of his sword ready to his hand; and the tinkle drew nearer,\nand he heard withal the trample of some riding-beast; so he went toward\nthe sound, and presently in a clearer place of the wood came upon a man\nof religion, a clerk, riding on a hackney, to whose neck hung a\nhorse-bell: the priest had saddle bags beside him and carried in his\nright hand a book in a bag.  When he met Ralph he blessed him, and\nRalph gave him the sele of the day, and asked him whither he would.\nSaid the Priest:  \"I am for the Little Plain and the Land of Abundance;\nwhence art thou, my son, and whither wilt thou?\" \"From that very land I\ncome,\" said Ralph, \"and as to whither, I seek adventures; but unless I\nsee more than I have this forenoon, or thou canst tell me of them, back\nwill I whence I came: yet to say sooth, I shall not be sorry for a\nfellow to help me back, for these woodland ways are some-what blind.\"\n\nSaid the Priest:  \"I will bear thee company with a good will; and I\nknow the road right well; for I am the Vicar appointed by the fathers\nof the Thorn to serve the church of the Little Plain, and the chapel of\nSt. Anthony yonder in the wood, and to-day I go to the church of the\ngood folk there.\"\n\nSo Ralph turned, and went along with him, walking by his bridle-rein.\nAnd as they went the priest said to him:  \"Art thou one of my lady's\nlords?\" Ralph reddened as he sighed, and said:  \"I am no captain of\nhers.\" Then smiled the priest and said:  \"Then will I not ask thee of\nthine errand; for belike thou wouldest not tell me thereof.\"\n\nRalph said nought, but waxed shamefaced as he deemed that the priest\neyed him curiously.  At last he said:  \"I will ask thee a question in\nturn, father.\"  \"Yea,\" said the priest.  Said Ralph:  \"This lady of the\nland, the Lady of Abundance, is she a very woman?\"  \"Holy Saints!\"\nquoth the priest, blessing himself, \"what meanest thou?\"  Said Ralph:\n\"I mean, is she of those who outwardly have a woman's semblance, but\nwithin are of the race of the ancient devils, the gods of the Gentiles?\"\n\nThen the priest crossed himself again, and spake as solemnly as a judge\non the bench:  \"Son, I pray that if thou art not in thy right mind,\nthou will come thereinto anon.  Know this, that whatever else she may\nbe, she is a right holy woman.  Or hast thou perchance heard any evil\ntales concerning her?\"\n\nNow Ralph was confused at his word, and knew not what to say; for\nthough in his mind he had been piecing together all that he had heard\nof the lady both for good and for evil, he had no clear tale to tell\neven to himself: so he answered nothing.\n\nBut the priest went on:  \"Son, I shall tell thee that such tales I have\nheard, but from whose mouth forsooth?  I will tell thee; from a sort of\nidle jades, young women who would be thought fairer than they be, who\nare afraid of everything save a naked man, and who can lie easier than\nthey can say their paternoster: from such as these come the stories; or\nfrom old crones who live in sour anger with themselves and all else,\nbecause they have lived no goodly life in their youth, and have not\nlearned the loveliness of holy church.  Now, son, shall the tales of\nsuch women, old and young, weigh in thy mind beside the word I tell\nthee of what I have seen and know concerning this most excellent of\nladies?  I trow not.  And for my part I tell thee, that though she is\nverily as fair as Venus (God save us) yet is she as chaste as Agnes, as\nwise as Katherine, and as humble and meek as Dorothy.  She bestoweth\nher goods plentifully to the church, and is merciful to poor men\ntherewith; and so far as occasion may serve her she is constant at the\nHoly Office; neither doth she spare to confess her sins, and to do all\npenance which is bidden her, yea and more.  For though I cannot say to\nmy knowledge that she weareth a hair; yet once and again have I seen\nher wending this woodland toward the chapel of her friend St. Anthony\nby night and cloud, so that few might see her, obedient to the\nScripture which sayeth, 'Let not thy right hand know what thy left hand\ndoeth,' and she barefoot in her smock amidst the rugged wood, and so\narrayed fairer than any queen in a golden gown.  Yea, as fair as the\nwoodwives of the ancient heathen.\"\n\n\nTherewith the priest stayed his words, and seemed as if he were fallen\ninto a dream; and he sighed heavily.  But Ralph walked on by his\nbridle-rein dreamy no less; for the words that he had heard he heeded\nnot, save as they made pictures for him of the ways of that woman of\nthe forest.\n\nSo they went on soberly till the priest lifted up his head and looked\nabout like one come out of slumber, and said in a firm voice: \"I tell\nthee, my son, that thou mayest set thy love upon her without sin.\"  And\ntherewith suddenly he fell a-weeping; and Ralph was ill at ease of his\nweeping, and went along by him saying nought; till the priest plucked\nup heart again, and said, turning to Ralph, but not meeting his eye:\n\"My son, I weep because men and women are so evil, and mis-say each\nother so sorely, even as they do by this holy woman.\" As he spake his\ntears brake out again, and Ralph strode on fast, so as to outgo him,\nthinking it unmannerly to seem as if he noted not his sorrow; yet\nwithal unable to say aught to him thereof.  Moreover it irked him to\nhear a grown man weeping for grief, even though it were but a priest.\n\nWithin a while the priest caught up with him, his tears all staunched,\nand fell to talk with him cheerfully concerning the wood, and the\nLittle Land and the dwellers therein and the conditions of them, and he\npraised them much, save the women.  Ralph answered him with good cheer\nin likewise; and thus they came to the cot of the old woman, and both\nshe and the maiden were without the house, the old carline hithering\nand thithering on some errand, the maiden leaning against a tree as if\npondering some matter.  As they passed by, the priest blessed them in\nwords, but his eyes scowled on them, whereat the carline grinned, but\nthe damsel heeded him not, but looked wistfully on Ralph.  The priest\nmuttered somewhat as he passed, which Ralph caught not the meaning of,\nand fell moody again; and when he was a little past the ford he drew\nrein and said: \"Now, son, I must to my cell hard by the church yonder:\nbut yet I will say one word to thee ere we sunder; to wit, that to my\nmind the Holy Lady will love no one but the saints of heaven, save it\nbe some man with whom all women are in love.\"\n\nTherewith he turned away suddenly, and rode smartly towards his church;\nand Ralph deemed that he was weeping once more.  As for Ralph, he went\nquietly home toward the castle, for the sun was setting now, and as he\nwent he pondered all these things in his heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nRalph Weareth Away Three Days Uneasily\n\n\nHe read again in the book that night, till he had gotten the whole tale\ninto his head, and he specially noted this of it, that it told not\nwhence that Lady came, nor what she was, nor aught else save that there\nshe was in the wood by herself, and was found therein by the king's\nson: neither told the tale in what year of the world she was found\nthere, though it told concerning all the war and miseries which she had\nbred, and which long endured.  Again, he could not gather from that\nbook why she had gone back to the lone place in the woods, whereas she\nmight have wedded one of those warring barons who sorely desired her:\nnor why she had yielded herself to the witch of that place and endured\nwith patience her thralldom, with stripes and torments of her body,\nlike the worst of the thralls of the ancient heathen men.  Lastly, he\nmight not learn from the book where in the world was that lone place,\nor aught of the road to the Well at the World's End.  But amidst all\nhis thinking his heart came back to this: \"When I meet her, she will\ntell me of it all; I need be no wiser than to learn how to meet her and\nto make her love me; then shall she show me the way to the Well at the\nWorld's End, and I shall drink thereof and never grow old, even as she\nendureth in youth, and she shall love me for ever, and I her for ever.\"\n\nSo he thought; but yet amidst these happy thoughts came in this evil\none, that whereas all the men-folk spoke well of her and worshipped\nher, the women-folk feared her or hated her; even to the lecherous old\nwoman who had praised the beauty of her body for his torment.  So he\nthought till his head grew heavy, and he went and lay down in his bed\nand slept, and dreamed of the days of Upmead; and things forgotten in\nhis waking time came between him and any memories of his present\nlonging and the days thereof.\n\nHe awoke and arose betimes in the morning, and when he had breakfasted\nhe bade the carline bring him his weapons.  \"Wilt thou again to the\nwood?\" said she.  \"Didst thou not bid me fare thither yesterday?\" said\nhe.  \"Yea,\" she said; \"but to-day I fear lest thou depart and come not\nback.\"  He laughed and said: \"Seest thou not, mother, that I go afoot,\nand I in hauberk and helm?  I cannot run far or fast from thee.  Also\"\n(and here he broke off his speech a little) \"where should I be but\nhere?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"but who knows what may happen?\"  Nevertheless she went\nand fetched his war-gear and looked at him fondly as he did it on, and\nwent his ways from the hall.\n\nNow he entered the wood more to the south than he had done yesterday,\nand went softly as before, and still was he turning over in his mind\nthe thoughts of last night, and ever they came back.  \"Might I but see\nher!  Would she but love me!  O for a draught of the Well at the\nWorld's End, that the love might last long and long!\"\n\nSo he went on a while betwixt the trees and the thickets, till it was a\nlittle past noon.  But all on a sudden a panic fear took him, lest she\nshould indeed come to the castle while he was away, and not finding\nhim, depart again, who knows whither; and when this thought came upon\nhim, he cried aloud, and hastened at his swiftest back again to the\ncastle, and came there breathless and wearied, and ran to the old\nwoman, and cried out to her; \"Is she come? is she come?\"\n\nThe carline laughed and said, \"Nay, she is not, but thou art come:\npraise be to the saints!  But what aileth thee?  Nay, fear not, she\nshall come at last.\"\n\nThen grew Ralph shamefaced and turned away from her, and miscalled\nhimself for a fool and a dastard that could not abide the pleasure of\nhis lady at the very place whereto she had let lead him.  So he wore\nthrough the remnant of the day howso he might, without going out-adoors\nagain; and the carline came and spake with him; but whatever he asked\nher about the lady, she would not tell aught of any import, so he\nrefrained him from that talk, and made a show of hearkening when she\nspake of other matters; as tales concerning the folk of the land, and\nthe Fathers of the Thorn, and so forth.\n\nOn the next morning he arose and said to himself, that whatever betid,\nhe would bide in the castle and the Plain of Abundance till the lady\ncame; and he went amongst the haymaking folk in the morning and ate his\ndinner with them, and strove to be of good cheer, and belike the carles\nand queens thought him merry company; but he was now wearying his heart\nwith longing, and might not abide any great while in one place; so\nwhen, dinner over, they turned to their work again, he went back to the\nCastle, and read in that book, and looked at the pictures thereof, and\nkept turning his wonder and hope and fear over and over again in his\nmind, and making to himself stories of how he should meet the Lady and\nwhat she would say to him, and how he should answer her, till at last\nthe night came, and he went to his bed, and slept for the very\nweariness of his longing.\n\nWhen the new day came he arose and went into the hall, and found the\ncarline there, who said to him, \"Fair sir, will thou to the wood again\nto-day?\" \"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"I must not, I dare not.\" \"Well,\" she said,\n\"thou mayest if thou wilt; why shouldst thou not go?\" Said Ralph,\nreddening and stammering:  \"Because I fear to; thrice have I been away\nlong from the castle and all has gone well; but the fourth time she\nwill come and find me gone.\"\n\nThe carline laughed:  \"Well,\" she said, \"I shall be here if thou goest;\nfor I promise thee not to stir out of the house whiles thou art away.\"\nSaid Ralph:  \"Nay, I will abide here.\"  \"Yea,\" she said, \"I see: thou\ntrustest me not.  Well, no matter; and to-day it will be handy if thou\nabidest.  For I have an errand to my brother in the flesh, who is one\nof the brethren of the Thorn over yonder.  If thou wilt give me leave,\nit will be to my pleasure and gain.\"\n\nRalph was glad when he heard this, deeming that if she left him alone\nthere, he would be the less tempted to stray into the wood again.\nBesides, he deemed that the Lady might come that day when he was alone\nin the Castle, and that himseemed would make the meeting sweeter yet.\nSo he yea-said the carline's asking joyously, and in an hour's time she\nwent her ways and left him alone there.\n\nRalph said to himself, when he saw her depart, that he would have the\nmore joy in the castle of his Lady if he were alone, and would wear\naway the day in better patience therefor.  But in sooth the hours of\nthat day were worse to wear than any day there had yet been.  He went\nnot without the house at all that day, for he deemed that the folk\nabroad would note of him that he was so changed and restless.\n\nWhiles he read in that book, or turned the leaves over, not reading it;\nwhiles he went into the Chamber of Estate, and pored over the woven\npictures there wherein the Lady was figured.  Whiles he wandered from\nchamber to chamber, not knowing what to do.\n\nAt last, a little after dark, back comes the carline again, and he met\nher at the door of the hall, for he was weary of his own company, and\nthe ceaseless turning over and over of the same thoughts.\n\nAs for her, she was so joyous of him that she fairly threw her arms\nabout him and kissed and clipped him, as though she had been his very\nmother.  Whereof he had some shame, but not much, for he deemed that\nher goodwill to him was abundant, which indeed it was.\n\nNow she looks on him and says:  \"Truly it does my heart good to see\nthee: but thou poor boy, thou art wearing thyself with thy longing, and\nthy doubting, and if thou wilt do after my rede, thou wilt certainly go\ninto the wood to-morrow and see what may befall; and indeed and in\nsooth thou wilt leave behind thee a trusty friend.\"\n\nHe looked on her kindly, and smiled, and said, \"In sooth, mother, I\ndeem thou art but right; though it be hard for me to leave this house,\nto which in a way my Lady hath bidden me.  Yet I will do thy bidding\nherein.\"  She thanked him, and he went to his bed and slept; for now\nthat he had made up his mind to go, he was somewhat more at rest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nAn Adventure in the Wood\n\n\nRalph arrayed himself for departure next morning without more words;\nand when he was ready the carline said to him:  \"When thou wentest\nforth before, I was troubled at thy going and feared for thy returning:\nbut now I fear not; for I know that thou wilt return; though it may be\nleading a fair woman by the hand.  So go, and all luck go with thee.\"\nRalph smiled at her words and went his ways, and came into the wood\nthat lay due south from the Castle, and he went on and on and had no\nthought of turning back.  He rested twice and still went on, till the\nfashion of the thickets and the woods changed about him; and at last\nwhen the sun was getting low, he saw light gleaming through a great\nwood of pines, which had long been dark before him against the tall\nboles, and soon he came to the very edge of the wood, and going\nheedfully, saw between the great stems of the outermost trees, a green\nstrand, and beyond it a long smooth water, a little lake between green\nbanks on either side.  He came out of the pinewood on to the grass; but\nthere were thornbushes a few about, so that moving warily from one to\nthe other, he might perchance see without being seen.  Warily he went\nforsooth, going along the green strand to the east and the head of that\nwater, and saw how the bank sloped up gently from its ending toward the\npine-wood, in front of whose close-set trees stood three great-boled\ntall oak-trees on a smooth piece of green sward.  And now he saw that\nthere were folk come before him on this green place, and keen-sighted\nas he was, could make out that three men were on the hither side of the\noak-trees, and on the further side of them was a white horse.\nThitherward then he made, stealing from bush to bush, since he deemed\nthat he needed not be seen of men who might be foes, for at the first\nsight he had noted the gleam of weapons there.  And now he had gone no\nlong way before he saw the westering sun shine brightly from a naked\nsword, and then another sprang up to meet it, and he heard faintly the\nclash of steel, and saw withal that the third of the folk had long and\nlight raiment and was a woman belike.  Then he bettered his pace, and\nin a minute or two came so near that he could see the men clearly, that\nthey were clad in knightly war-gear, and were laying on great strokes\nso that the still place rang with the clatter.  As for the woman, he\ncould see but little of her, because of the fighting men before her;\nand the shadow of the oak boughs fell on her withal.\n\nNow as he went, hidden by the bushes, they hid the men also from him,\nand when he was come to the last bush, some fifty paces from them, and\npeered out from it, in that very nick of time the two knights were\nbreathing them somewhat, and Ralph saw that one of them, the furthest\nfrom him, was a very big man with a blue surcoat whereon was beaten a\ngreat golden sun, and the other, whose back was towards Ralph, was clad\nin black over his armour.  Even as he looked and doubted whether to\nshow himself or not, he of the sun raised his sword aloft, and giving\nforth a great roar as of wrath and grief mingled together, rushed on\nhis foe and smote so fiercely that he fell to the earth before him, and\nthe big man fell upon him as he fell, and let knee and sword-pommel and\nfist follow the stroke, and there they wallowed on the earth together.\n\nStraightway Ralph came forth from the bushes with his drawn sword in\nhis hand, and even therewith what with the two knights being both low\nupon the earth, what with the woman herself coming from out the shadow\nof the oak boughs, and turning her toward Ralph, he saw her clearly,\nand stood staring and amazed--for lo! it was the Lady whom he had\ndelivered at the want-ways. His heart well nigh stood still with joy,\nyet was he shamefaced also: for though now she was no longer clad in\nthat scanty raiment, yet did he seem to see her body through that which\ncovered it.  But now her attire was but simple; a green gown, thin and\nshort, and thereover a cote-hardy of black cloth with orphreys of gold\nand colours:  but on her neck was a collar that seemed to him like to\nthat which Dame Katherine had given him; and the long tresses of her\nhair, which he had erst seen floating loose about her, were wound as a\ngarland around her head.  She looked with a flushed and joyous face on\nRalph, and seemed as if she heeded nought the battle of the knights,\nbut saw him only: but he feared her, and his love for her and stood\nstill, and durst not move forward to go to her.\n\nThus they abode for about the space of one minute:  and meanwhile the\nbig man rose up on one knee and steadied him with his sword for a\nmoment of time, and the blade was bloody from the point half way up to\nthe hilt; but the black knight lay still and made no sign of life.\nThen the Knight of the Sun rose up slowly and stood on his feet and\nfaced the Lady and seemed not to see Ralph, for his back was towards\nhim.  He came slowly toward the Lady, scowling, and his face white as\nchalk; then he spake to her coldly and sternly, stretching out his\nbloody sword before her.\n\n\"I have done thy bidding, and slain my very earthly friend of friends\nfor thy sake.  Wherewith wilt thou reward me?\"\n\nThen once more Ralph heard the voice, which he remembered so sweet\namidst peril and battle aforetime, as she said as coldly as the Knight:\n\"I bade thee not:  thine own heart bade thee to strive with him because\nthou deemedst that he loved me.  Be content! thou hast slain him who\nstood in thy way, as thou deemedst.  Thinkest thou that I rejoice at\nhis slaying?  O no!  I grieve at it, for all that I had such good cause\nto hate him.\"\n\nHe said:  \"My own heart! my own heart!  Half of my heart biddeth me\nslay thee, who hast made me slay him.  What wilt thou give me?\" She\nknit her brow and spake angrily:  \"Leave to depart,\" she said.  Then\nafter a while, and in a kinder voice:  \"And thus much of my love, that\nI pray thee not to sorrow for me, but to have a good heart, and live as\na true knight should.\"  He frowned: \"Wilt thou not go with me?\" said\nhe.  \"Not uncompelled,\" she said: \"if thou biddest me go with threats\nof hewing and mangling the body which thou sayest thou lovest, needs\nmust I go then.  Yet scarce wilt thou do this.\"\n\n\"I have a mind to try it,\" said he; \"If I set thee on thine horse and\nbound thine hands for thee, and linked thy feet together under the\nbeast's belly; belike thou wouldest come.  Shall I have slain my\nbrother-in-arms for nought?\"\n\n\"Thou hast the mind,\" said she, \"hast thou the might?\" \"So I deem,\"\nsaid he, smiling grimly.\n\nShe looked at him proudly and said:  \"Yea, but I misdoubt me thereof.\"\nHe still had his back to Ralph and was staring at the lady; she turned\nher head a little and made a sign to Ralph, just as the Knight of the\nSun said: \"Thou misdoubtest thee?  Who shall help thee in the desert?\"\n\n\"Look over thy left shoulder,\" she said.  He turned, and saw Ralph\ndrawing near, sword in hand, smiling, but somewhat pale.  He drew aback\nfrom the Lady and, spinning round on his heel, faced Ralph, and cried\nout:  \"Hah!  Hast thou raised up a devil against me, thou sorceress, to\ntake from me my grief and my lust, and my life?  Fair will the game be\nto fight with thy devil as I have fought with my friend!  Yet now I\nknow not whether I shall slay him or thee.\"\n\nShe spake not, but stood quietly looking on him, not unkindly, while a\nwind came up from the water and played with a few light locks of hair\nthat hung down from that ruddy crown, and blew her raiment from her\nfeet and wrapped it close round her limbs; and Ralph beheld her, and\nclose as was the very death to him (for huge and most warrior-like was\nhis foeman) yet longing for her melted the heart within him, and he\nfelt the sweetness of life in his inmost soul as he had never felt it\nbefore.\n\nSuddenly the Knight of the Sun turned about to the Lady again, and fell\ndown on his knees before her, and clasped his hands as one praying, and\nsaid:  \"Now pardon me all my words, I pray thee; and let this young man\ndepart unhurt, whether thou madest him, or hast but led him away from\ncountry and friends and all.  Then do thou come with me, and make some\nsemblance of loving me, and suffer me to love thee.  And then shall all\nbe well, for in a few days we will go back to thy people, and there\nwill I be their lord or thy servant, or my brother's man, or what thou\nwilt.  O wilt thou not let the summer days be sweet?\"\n\nBut she spake, holding up her head proudly and speaking in a clear\nringing voice:  \"I have said it, that uncompelled I will not go with\nthee at all.\"  And therewithal she turned her face toward Ralph, as she\nmight do on any chance-met courteous man, and he saw her smiling, but\nshe said nought to him, and gave no token of knowing him.  Then the\nKnight of the Sun sprang to his feet, and shook his sword above his\nhead and ran furiously on Ralph, who leapt nimbly on one side (else had\nhe been slain at once) and fetched a blow at the Sun-Knight, and smote\nhim, and brake the mails on his left shoulder, so that the blood\nsprang, and fell on fiercely enough, smiting to right and left as the\nother gave back at his first onset.  But all was for nought, for the\nKnight of the Sun, after his giving aback under that first stroke drew\nhimself up stark and stiff, and pressing on through all Ralph's\nstrokes, though they rent his mail here and there, ran within his\nsword, and smote him furiously with the sword-pommel on the side of the\nhead, so that the young man of Upmeads could not stand up under the\nweight of the blow, but fell to the earth swooning, and the Knight of\nthe Sun knelt on him, and drew out an anlace, short, thick and sharp,\nand cried out:  \"Now, Devil, let see whether thou wilt bleed black.\"\nTherewith he raised up his hand:  but the weapon was stayed or ever it\nfell, for the Lady had glided up to them when she saw that Ralph was\novercome, and now she stretched out her arm and caught hold of the\nKnight's hand and the anlace withal, and he groaned and cried out:\n\"What now! thou art strong-armed as well as white-armed;\" (for she had\nrent the sleeve back from her right arm) and he laughed in the\nextremity of his wrath.  But she was pale and her lips quivered as she\nsaid softly and sweetly: \"Wilt thou verily slay this young man?\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said he, \"since I have just slain the best friend that I\never had, though he was nought willing to fight with me, and only for\nthis, that I saw thee toying with him; though forsooth thou hast said\ntruly that thou hadst more reason to hate him than love him.  Well,\nsince thou wilt not have this youngling slain, I may deem at least that\nhe is no devil of thy making, else wouldst thou be glad of his slaying,\nso that he might be out of the path of thee; so a man he is, and a\nwell-favoured one, and young; and valiant, as it seemeth: so I suppose\nthat he is thy lover, or will be one day--well then--\"\n\nAnd he lifted his hand again, but again she stayed him, and said: \"Look\nthou, I will buy him of thee: and, indeed, I owe him a life.\" \"How is\nthat?\" said he.  \"Why wouldst thou know?\" she said; \"thou who, if thou\nhadst me in thine hands again, wouldst keep me away from all men.  Yea,\nI know what thou wouldst say, thou wouldst keep me from sinning again.\"\nAnd she smiled, but bitterly.  \"Well, the tale is no long one: five\ndays ago I was taken by them of the Burg:  and thou wottest what they\nwould do with me; yea, even if they deemed me less than they do deem\nme: well, as two of their men-at-arms were leading me along by a\nhalter, as a calf is led to the butcher, we fell in with this goodly\nlad, who slew them both in manly fashion, and I escaped for that time:\nthough, forsooth, I must needs put my neck in the noose again in\ndelivering four of our people, who would else have been tormented to\ndeath by the Burgers.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the knight, \"perchance thou hast more mercy than I looked\nfor of thee; though I misdoubt thee that thou mayst yet pray me or some\nother to slay him for thee.  Thou art merciful, my Queen, though not to\nme, and a churl were I if I were less merciful than thou.  Therefore\nwill I give his life to him, yet not to thee will I give him if I may\nhelp it--Lo you, Sweet! he is just opening his eyes.\"\n\nTherewith he rose up from Ralph, who raised himself a little, and sat\nup dazed and feeble.  The Knight of the Sun stood up over him beside\nthe lady with his hands clasped on his sword-hilt, and said to Ralph:\n\"Young man, canst thou hear my words?\"  Ralph smiled feebly and nodded\na yea-say. \"Dost thou love thy life then?\" said the Knight.  Ralph\nfound speech and said faintly, \"Yea.\"  Said the Knight: \"Where dost\nthou come from, where is thine home?\"  Said Ralph, \"Upmeads.\" \"Well\nthen,\" quoth the big knight, \"go back to Upmeads, and live.\" Ralph\nshook his head and knit his brows and said, \"I will not.\" \"Yea,\" said\nthe Knight, \"thou wilt not live?  Then must I shape me to thy humour.\nStand on thy feet and fight it out; for now I am cool I will not slay a\nswordless man.\"\n\nRalph staggered up to his feet, but was so feeble still, that he sank\ndown again, and muttered:  \"I may not; I am sick and faint;\" and\ntherewith swooned away again.  But the Knight stood a while leaning on\nhis sword, and looking down on him not unkindly.  Then he turned about\nto the Lady, but lo! she had left his side.  She had glided away, and\ngot to her horse, which was tethered on the other side of the oak-tree,\nand had loosed him and mounted him, and so sat in the saddle there, the\nreins gathered in her hands.  She smiled on the knight as he stood\nastonished, and cried to him; \"Now, lord, I warn thee, draw not a\nsingle foot nigher to me; for thou seest that I have Silverfax between\nmy knees, and thou knowest how swift he is, and if I see thee move, he\nshall spring away with me.  Thou wottest how well I know all the ways\nof the woodland, and I tell thee that the ways behind me to the Dry\nTree be all safe and open, and that beyond the Gliding River I shall\ncome on Roger of the Ropewalk and his men.  And if thou thinkest to\nride after me, and overtake me, cast the thought out of thy mind.  For\nthy horse is strong but heavy, as is meet for so big a knight, and\nmoreover he is many yards away from me and Silverfax: so before thou\nart in the saddle, where shall I be?  Yea,\" (for the Knight was\nhandling his anlace) \"thou mayst cast it, and peradventure mayst hit\nSilverfax and not me, and peradventure not; and I deem that it is my\nbody alive that thou wouldest have back with thee.  So now, wilt thou\nhearken?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth the knight, though for wrath he could scarce bring the\nword from his mouth.\n\n\"Hearken,\" she said, \"this is the bargain to be struck between us: even\nnow thou wouldst not refrain from slaying this young man, unless\nperchance he should swear to depart from us; and as for me, I would not\ngo back with thee to Sunhome, where erst thou shamedst me.  Now will I\nbuy thy nay-say with mine, and if thou give the youngling his life, and\nsuffer him to come his ways with us, then will I go home with thee and\nwill ride with thee in all the love and duty that I owe thee; or if\nthou like this fashion of words better, I will give thee my body for\nhis life.  But if thou likest not the bargain, there is not another\npiece of goods for thee in the market, for then I will ride my ways to\nthe Dry Tree, and thou shalt slay the poor youth, or make of him thy\nsworn friend, like as was Walter--which thou wilt.\"\n\nSo she spake, and Ralph yet lay on the grass and heard nought.  But the\nKnight's face was dark and swollen with anger as he answered: \"My sworn\nfriend! yea, I understand thy gibe.  I need not thy words to bring to\nmy mind how I have slain one sworn friend for thy sake.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she said, \"not for my sake, for thine own folly's sake.\" He\nheeded her not, but went on:  \"And as for this one, I say again of him,\nif he be not thy devil, then thou meanest him for thy lover.  And now I\ndeem that I will verily slay him, ere he wake again; belike it were his\nbetter luck.\"\n\nShe said:  \"I wot not why thou hagglest over the price of that thou\nwouldest have.  If thou have him along with thee, shall he not be in\nthy power--as I shall be? and thou mayst slay him--or me--when thou\nwilt.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" he said, grimly, \"when thou art weary of him.  O art thou not\nshameless amongst women!  Yet must I needs pay thy price, though my\nhonour and the welfare of my life go with it.  Yet how if he have no\nwill to fare with us?\"  She laughed and said: \"Then shalt thou have him\nwith thee as thy captive and thrall.  Hast thou not conquered him in\nbattle?\"  He stood silent a moment and then he said:  \"Thou sayest it;\nhe shall come with me, will he, nill he, unarmed, and as a prisoner,\nand the spoil of my valiancy.\" And he laughed, not altogether in\nbitterness, but as if some joy were rising in his heart.  \"Now, my\nQueen,\" said he, \"the bargain is struck betwixt us, and thou mayest\nlight down off Silverfax; as for me, I will go fetch water from the\nlake, that we may wake up this valiant and mighty youth, this newfound\njewel, and bring him to his wits again.\"\n\nShe answered nought, but rode her horse close to him and lighted down\nnimbly, while his greedy eyes devoured her beauty.  Then he took her\nhand and drew her to him, and kissed her cheek, and she suffered it,\nbut kissed him not again.  Then he took off his helm, and went down to\nthe lake to fetch up water therein.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nThe Leechcraft of the Lady\n\n\nMeanwhile she went to Ralph and stood by him, who now began to stir\nagain; and she knelt down by him and kissed his face gently, and rose\nup hastily and stood a little aloof again.\n\nNow Ralph sat up and looked about him, and when he saw the Lady he\nfirst blushed red, and then turned very pale; for the full life was in\nhim again, and he knew her, and love drew strongly at his\nheart-strings. But she looked on him kindly and said to him:  \"How\nfares it with thee?  I am sorry of thy hurt which thou hast had for\nme.\"  He said: \"Forsooth, Lady, a chance knock or two is no great\nmatter for a lad of Upmeads.  But oh!  I have seen thee before.\" \"Yea,\"\nshe said, \"twice before, fair knight.\"  \"How is that?\" he said; \"once I\nsaw thee, the fairest thing in the world, and evil men would have led\nthee to slaughter; but not twice.\"\n\nShe smiled on him still more kindly, as if he were a dear friend, and\nsaid simply:  \"I was that lad in the cloak that ye saw in the Flower de\nLuce; and afterwards when ye, thou and Roger, fled away from the Burg\nof the Four Friths.  I had come into the Burg with my captain of war at\nthe peril of our lives to deliver four faithful friends of mine who\nwere else doomed to an evil death.\"\n\nHe said nought, but gazed at her face, wondering at her valiancy and\ngoodness.  She took him by the hand now, and held it without speaking\nfor a little while, and he sat there still looking up into her face,\nwondering at her sweetness and his happiness.  Then she said, as she\ndrew her hand away and spake in such a voice, and so looking at him,\nthat every word was as a caress to him: \"Thy soul is coming back to\nthee, my friend, and thou art well at ease: is it not so?\"\n\n\"O yea,\" he said, \"and I woke up happily e'en now; for me-dreamed that\nmy gossip came to me and kissed me kindly; and she is a fair woman, but\nnot a young woman.\"\n\nAs he spoke the knight, who had come nearly noiselessly over the grass,\nstood by them, holding his helm full of water, and looking grimly upon\nthem; but the Lady looked up at him with wide eyes wonderingly, and\nRalph, beholding her, deemed that all he had heard of her goodness was\nbut the very sooth.  But the knight spake:  \"Young man, thou hast\nfought with me, thou knowest not wherefore, and grim was my mood when\nthou madest thine onset, and still is, so that never but once wilt thou\nbe nigher thy death than thou hast been this hour.  But now I have\ngiven thee life because of the asking of this lady; and therewith I\ngive thee leave to come thy ways with us: nay, rather I command thee to\ncome, for thou art my prisoner, to be kept or ransomed, or set free as\nI will.  But my will is that thou shalt not have thine armour and\nweapons; and there is a cause for this, which mayhappen I will tell\nthee hereafter.  But now I bid thee drink of this water, and then do\noff thine helm and hauberk and give me thy sword and dagger, and go\nwith us peaceably; and be not overmuch ashamed, for I have overcome men\nwho boasted themselves to be great warriors.\"\n\nSo Ralph drank of the water, and did off his helm, and cast water on\nhis face, and arose, and said smiling:  \"Nay, my master, I am nought\nashamed of my mishaps:  and as to my going with thee and the Lady, thou\nhast heard me say under thy dagger that I would not forbear to follow\nher; so I scarce need thy command thereto.\"  The knight scowled on him\nand said: \"Hold thy peace, fool!  Thou wert best not stir my wrath\nagain.\" \"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"thou hast my sword, and mayst slay me if\nthou wilt; therefore be not word-valiant with me.\"\n\nSaid the Knight of the Sun:  \"Well, well, thou hast the right of it\nthere.  Only beware lest thou try me overmuch.  But now must we set\nforth on our road; and here is work for thee to do:  a hundred yards\nwithin the thick wood in a straight line from the oak-tree thou shalt\nfind two horses, mine and the knight's who fell before me; go thou and\nbring them hither; for I will not leave thee with my lady, lest I have\nto slay thee in the end, and maybe her also.\"\n\nRalph nodded cheerfully, and set off on his task, and was the readier\ntherein because the Lady looked on him kindly and compassionately as he\nwent by her.  He found the horses speedily, a black horse that was of\nthe Black Knight, and a bay of the Knight of the Sun, and he came back\nwith them lightly.\n\nBut when he came to the oak-tree again, lo, the knight and the Lady\nboth kneeling over the body of the Black Knight, and Ralph saw that the\nKnight of the Sun was sobbing and weeping sorely, so that he deemed\nthat he was taking leave of his friend that lay dead there:  but when\nRalph had tied up those other two steeds by Silverfax and drawn rear to\nthose twain, the Knight of the Sun looked up at him, and spake in a\ncheerful voice: \"Thou seemest to be no ill man, though thou hast come\nacross my lady; so now I bid thee rejoice that there is a good knight\nmore in the world than we deemed e'en now; for this my friend Walter\nthe Black is alive still.\" \"Yea,\" said the Lady, \"and belike he shall\nlive a long while yet.\"\n\nSo Ralph looked, and saw that they had stripped the knight of his\nhauberk and helm, and bared his body, and that the Lady was dressing a\ngreat and sore wound in his side; neither was he come to himself again:\nhe was a young man, and very goodly to look on, dark haired and\nstraight of feature, fair of face; and Ralph felt a grief at his heart\nas he beheld the Lady's hands dealing with his bare flesh, though\nnought the man knew of it belike.\n\nAs for the Knight of the Sun, he was no more grim and moody, but\nsmiling and joyous, and he spake and said:  \"Young man, this shall\nstand thee in good stead that I have not slain my friend this bout.\nSooth to say, it might else have gone hard with thee on the way to my\nhouse, or still more in my house.  But now be of good heart, for unless\nof thine own folly thou run on the sword's point, thou mayst yet live\nand do well.\" Then he turned to the Lady and said:  \"Dame, for as good\na leech as ye be, ye may not heal this man so that he may sit in his\nsaddle within these ten days; and now what is to do in this matter?\"\n\nShe looked on him with smiling lips and a strange light in her eyes,\nand said:  \"Yea, forsooth, what wilt thou do?  Wilt thou abide here by\nWalter thyself alone, and let me bring the imp of Upmeads home to our\nhouse?  Or wilt thou ride home and send folk with a litter to us?  Or\nshall this youngling ride at all adventure, and seek to Sunway through\nthe blind woodland?  Which shall it be?\"\n\nThe knight laughed outright, and said:  \"Yea, fair one, this is much\nlike to the tale of the carle at the ferry with the fox, and the goat,\nand the cabbage.\"\n\nThere was scarce a smile on her face as she said gently: \"One thing is\nto be thought of, that Walter's soul is not yet so fast in his body\nthat either thou or some rough-handed leech may be sure of healing him;\nit must be this hand, and the learning which it hath learned which must\ndeal with him for a while.\"  And she stretched out her arm over the\nwounded man, with the fingers pointing down the water, and reddened\nwithal, as if she felt the hearts' greediness of the two men who were\nlooking on her beauty.\n\nThe big knight sighed, and said:  \"Well, unless I am to kill him over\nagain, there is nothing for it but our abiding with him for the next\nfew hours at least.  To-morrow is a new day, and fair is the\nwoodland-hall of summer-tide; neither shall water fail us.  But as to\nvictual, I wot not save that we have none.\"\n\nThe Lady laughed, and said to Ralph; \"Who knoweth what thou mayst find\nif thou go to the black horse and look into the saddle-bags which I saw\nupon him awhile agone?  For indeed we need somewhat, if it were but to\nkeep the life in the body of this wounded man.\"\n\nRalph sprang up and turned to the horse, and found the saddle-bags on\nhim, and took from them bread and flesh, and a flask of good wine, and\nbrought them to the Lady, who laughed and said:  \"Thou art a good\nseeker and no ill finder.\"  Then she gave the wounded man to drink of\nthe wine, so that he stirred somewhat, and the colour came into his\nface a little.  Then she bade gather store of bracken for a bed for the\nBlack Knight, and Ralph bestirred himself therein, but the Knight of\nthe Sun sat looking at the Lady as she busied herself with his friend,\nand gloom seemed gathering on him again.\n\nBut when the bracken was enough, the Lady made a bed deftly and\nspeedily; and between the three they laid the wounded man thereon, who\nseemed coming to himself somewhat, and spake a few words, but those\nnothing to the point.  Then the Lady took her gay embroidered cloak,\nwhich lay at the foot of the oak tree, and cast it over him and, as\nRalph deemed, eyed him lovingly, and belike the Knight of the Sun\nthought in likewise, for he scowled upon her; and for awhile but little\nwas the joyance by the ancient oak, unless it were with the Lady.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\nSupper and Slumber in the Woodland Hall\n\n\nBut when all was done to make the wounded knight as easy as might be,\nthe Lady turned to the other twain, and said kindly: \"Now, lords, it\nwere good to get to table, since here is wherewithal.\" And she looked\non them both full kindly as she spake the words, but nowise wantonly;\neven as the lady of a fair house might do by honoured guests.  So the\nhearts of both were cheered, and nothing loth they sat down by her on\nthe grass and fell to meat.  Yet was the Knight of the Sun a little\nmoody for a while, but when he had eaten and drunken somewhat, he said:\n\"It were well if someone might come hereby, some hermit or holy man, to\nwhom we might give the care of Walter: then might we home to Sunway,\nand send folk with a litter to fetch him home softly when the due time\nwere.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the Lady, \"that might happen forsooth, and perchance it\nwill; and if it were before nightfall it were better.\"\n\nRalph saw that as she spake she took hold of the two fingers of her\nleft hand with her right forefinger, and let the thumb meet it, so that\nit made a circle about them, and she spake something therewith in a low\nvoice, but he heeded it little, save as he did all ways that her body\nmoved.  As for the Knight of the Sun, he was looking down on the grass\nas one pondering matters, and noted this not.  But he said presently:\n\"What hast thou to say of Walter now?  Shall he live?\"  \"Yea,\" she\nsaid, \"maybe as long as either of you twain.\" The knight looked hard at\nRalph, but said nothing, and Ralph heeded not his looks, for his eyes\nwere busy devouring the Lady.\n\nSo they abode a little, and the more part of what talk there was came\nfrom the Lady, and she was chiefly asking Ralph of his home in Upmeads,\nand his brethren and kindred, and he told her all openly, and hid\nnaught, while her voice ravished his very soul from him, and it seemed\nstrange to him, that such an one should hold him in talk concerning\nthese simple matters and familiar haps, and look on him so kindly and\nsimply.  Ever and anon would she go and look to the welfare of the\nwounded man, and come back from him (for they sat a little way aloof),\nand tell them how he did.  And still the Knight of the Sun took little\nheed, and once again gloom settled down on him.\n\nAmidst all this the sun was set, and the long water lay beneath the\nheavens like a sheet of bright, fair-hued metal, and naught stirred it:\ntill at last the Lady leaned forward to Ralph, and touched his shoulder\n(for he was sitting over against her, with his back to the water), and\nshe said: \"Sir Knight, Sir Knight, his wish is coming about, I believe\nverily.\" He turned his head to look over his shoulder, and, as if by\nchance-hap, his cheek met the outstretched hand she was pointing with:\nshe drew it not away very speedily, and as sweet to him was the touch\nof it as if his face had been brushed past by a summer lily.\n\n\"Nay, look! something cometh,\" she cried; and he looked and saw a\nlittle boat making down the water toward the end anigh them.  Then the\nKnight of the Sun seemed to awake at her word, and he leapt to his\nfeet, and stood looking at the new comer.\n\nIt was but a little while ere the boat touched the shore, and a man\nstepped out of it on to the grass and made it fast to the bank, and\nthen stood and looked about him as if seeking something; and lo, it was\na holy man, a hermit in the habit of the Blackfriars.\n\nThen the Knight of the Sun hastened down to the strand to meet him, and\nwhen Ralph was thus left alone with the Lady, though it were but for a\nlittle, his heart beat and he longed sore to touch her with his hand,\nbut durst not, and did but hope that her hand would stray his way as it\nhad e'en now.  But she arose and stood a little way from him, and spake\nto him sweetly of the fairness of the evening, and the wounded man, and\nthe good hap of the friar's coming before nightfall; and his heart was\nwrung sore with the love of her.\n\nSo came the knight up from the strand, and the holy man with him, who\ngreeted Ralph and the Lady and blessed them, and said: \"Now, daughter,\nshow me thy sick man; for I am somewhat of a leech, and this thy baron\nwould have me heal him, and I have a right good will thereto.\"\n\nSo he went to the Black Knight, and when he had looked to his hurts, he\nturned to them and said:  \"Have ye perchance any meat in the\nwilderness?\" \"Yea,\" quoth the Knight of the Sun; \"there is enough for a\nday or more, and if we must needs abide here longer, I or this young\nman may well make shift to slay some deer, great or little, for our\nsustenance and the healing of my friend.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said the Friar; \"my hermitage is no great way hence, in\nthe thicket at the end of this water.  But now is the fever on this\nknight, and we may not move him ere morning at soonest; but to-morrow\nwe may make a shift to bear him hence by boat: or, if not, then may I\ngo and fetch from my cell bread and other meat, and milk of my goats;\nand thus shall we do well till we may bring him to my cell, and then\nshall ye leave him there; and afterwards I will lead him home to Sunway\nwhere thou dwellest, baron, when he is well enough healed; or, if he\nwill not go thither, let him go his ways, and I myself will come to\nSunway and let thee wot of his welfare.\"\n\nThe knight yeasaid all this, and thereafter the Friar and the Lady\ntogether tended the wounded knight, and gave him water to drink, and\nwine.  And meanwhile Ralph and the Knight of the Sun lay down on the\ngrass and watched the eve darkening, and Ralph marvelled at his\nhappiness, and wondered what the morrow would bring forth.\n\nBut amidst his happy thoughts the Knight of the Sun spake to him and\nsaid: \"Young knight, I have struck a bargain with her that thou shalt\nfollow us home, if thou wilt:  but to say sooth, I think when the\nbargain was struck I was minded when I had thee at Sunway to cast thee\ninto my prison.  But now I will do otherwise, and if thou must needs\nfollow after thine own perdition, as I have, thou shalt do so freely;\ntherefore take again thine armour and weapons, and do what thou wilt\nwith them.  But if thou wilt do after my rede, get thee away to-morrow,\nor better, to-night, and desire our fellowship no more.\"\n\nRalph heard him, and the heart within him was divided.  It was in his\nmind to speak debonnairely to the knight; but again he felt as if he\nhated him, and the blythe words would not come, and he answered\ndoggedly: \"I will not leave my Lady since she biddeth me go with her.\nIf thou wilt then, make the most of it that thou art stronger than I,\nand a warrior more proven; set me before thy sword, and fight with me\nand slay me.\"\n\nThen rose the wrath to the knight's lips, and he brake forth:  \"Then is\nthere one other thing for thee to do, and that is that thou take thy\nsword, which I have just given back to thee, and thrust her through\ntherewith.  That were better for thee and for me, and for him who lieth\nyonder.\"\n\nTherewith he arose and strode up and down in the dusk, and Ralph\nwondered at him, yet hated him now not so much, since he deemed that\nthe Lady would not love him, and that he was angered thereby.  Yet\nabout Ralph's heart there hung a certain fear of what should be.\n\nBut presently the knight came and sat down by him again, and again fell\nto speech with him, and said:  \"Thou knowest that I may not slay thee,\nand yet thou sayest, fight with me; is this well done?\" \"Is it ill\ndone?\" said Ralph, \"I wot not why.\"\n\nThe knight was silent awhile, and then he said:  \"With what words shall\nI beseech thee to depart while it is yet time?  It may well be that in\ndays to come I shall be good to thee, and help thee.\"\n\nBut Ralph said never a word.  Then said the knight, and sighed withal:\n\"I now see this of thee, that thou mayst not depart; well, so let it\nbe!\" and he sighed heavily again.  Then Ralph strove with himself, and\nsaid courteously:  \"Sir, I am sorry that I am a burden irksome to thee;\nand that, why I know not, thou mayst not rid thyself of me by the\nstrong hand, and that otherwise thou mayst not be rid of me.  What then\nis this woman to thee, that thou wouldst have me slay her, and yet art\nso fierce in thy love for her?\"  The Knight of the Sun laughed\nwrathfully thereat, and was on the point of answering him, when up came\nthose two from the wounded man, and the Friar said: \"The knight shall\ndo well; but well it is for him that the Lady of Abundance was here for\nhis helping; for from her hands goeth all healing, as it was with the\nholy men of old time.  May the saints keep her from all harm; for meek\nand holy indeed she is, as oft we have heard it.\"\n\nThe Lady put her hand on his shoulder, as if to bid him silence, and\nthen set herself down on the grass beside the Knight of the Sun, and\nfell to talking sweetly and blithely to the three men.  The Friar\nanswered her with many words, and told her of the deer and fowl of the\nwood and the water that he was wont to see nigh to his hermitage; for\nof such things she asked him, and at last he said: \"Good sooth, I\nshould be shy to say in all places and before all men of all my\ndealings with God's creatures which live about me there.  Wot ye what?\nE'en now I had no thought of coming hitherward; but I was sitting\namongst the trees pondering many things, when I began to drowse, and\ndrowsing I heard the thornbushes speaking to me like men, and they bade\nme take my boat and go up the water to help a man who was in need; and\nthat is how I came hither; benedicite.\"\n\nSo he spake; but the Knight of the Sun did but put in a word here and\nthere, and that most often a sour and snappish word.  As for Ralph, he\nalso spake but little, and strayed somewhat in his answers; for he\ncould not but deem that she spake softlier and kinder to him than to\nthe others; and he was dreamy with love and desire, and scarce knew\nwhat he was saying.\n\nThus they wore away some two hours, the Friar or the Lady turning away\nat whiles to heed the wounded man, who was now talking wildly in his\nfever.\n\nBut at last the night was grown as dark as it would be, since cloud and\nstorm came not, for the moon had sunk down: so the Lady said:  \"Now,\nlords, our candle hath gone out, and I for my part will to bed; so let\nus each find a meet chamber in the woodland hall; and I will lie near\nto thee, father, and the wounded friend, lest I be needed to help thee\nin the night; and thou, Baron of Sunway, lie thou betwixt me and the\nwood, to ward me from the wild deer and the wood-wights. But thou,\nSwain of Upmeads, wilt thou deem it hard to lie anear the horses, to\nwatch them if they be scared by aught?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the Knight of the Sun, \"thou art Lady here forsooth; even\nas men say of thee, that thou swayest man and beast in the wildwood.\nBut this time at least it is not so ill-marshalled of thee: I myself\nwould have shown folk to chamber here in likewise.\"\n\nTherewith he rose up, and walked to and fro for a little, and then\nwent, and sat down on a root of the oak-tree, clasping his knees with\nhis hands, but lay not down awhile.  But the Lady made herself a bed of\nthe bracken which was over from those that Ralph had gathered for the\nbed of the wounded Knight; and the Friar lay down on the grass nigh to\nher, and both were presently asleep.\n\nThen Ralph got up quietly; and, shamefacedly for very love, passed\nclose beside the sleeping woman as he went to his place by the horses,\ntaking his weapons and wargear with him: and he said to himself as he\nlaid him down, that it was good for him to be quite alone, that he\nmight lie awake and think at his ease of all the loveliness and\nkindness of his Lady.  Howbeit, he was a young man, and a sturdy, used\nto lying abroad in the fields or the woods, and it was his custom to\nsleep at once and sweetly when he lay down after the day's work had\nwearied him, and even so he did now, and was troubled by no dreams of\nwhat was past or to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWO\n\nThe Road Unto Trouble\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nRalph Meets With Love in the Wilderness\n\n\nHe woke up while it was yet night, and knew that he had been awakened\nby a touch; but, like a good hunter and warrior, he forebore to start\nup or cry out till sleep had so much run off him that he could tell\nsomewhat of what was toward.  So now he saw the Lady bending over him,\nand she said in a kind and very low voice:  \"Rise up, young man, rise\nup, Ralph, and say no word, but come with me a little way into the wood\nere dawn come, for I have a word for thee.\"\n\nSo he stood up and was ready to go with her, his heart beating hard for\njoy and wonder.  \"Nay,\" she whispered, \"take thy sword and war-gear\nlest ill befall:  do on thine hauberk; I will be thy squire.\"  And she\nheld his war-coat out for him to do on.  \"Now,\" she said, still softly,\n\"hide thy curly hair with the helm, gird thy sword to thee, and come\nwithout a word.\"\n\nEven so he did, and therewithal felt her hand take his (for it was dark\nas they stepped amidst the trees), and she led him into the Seventh\nHeaven, for he heard her voice, though it were but a whisper, as it\nwere a caress and a laugh of joy in each word.\n\nShe led him along swiftly, fumbling nought with the paths betwixt the\npine-tree boles, where it was as dark as dark might be.  Every minute\nhe looked to hear her say a word of why she had brought him thither,\nand that then she would depart from him; so he prayed that the silence\nand the holding of his hand might last a long while--for he might\nthink of naught save her--and long it lasted forsooth, and still she\nspake no word, though whiles a little sweet chuckle, as of the garden\nwarbler at his softest, came from her lips, and the ripple of her\nraiment as her swift feet drave it, sounded loud to his eager ears in\nthe dark, windless wood.\n\nAt last, and it was more than half-an-hour of their walking thus, it\ngrew lighter, and he could see the shape of her alongside of him; and\nstill she held his hand and glided on swifter and swifter, as he\nthought; and soon he knew that outside the wood dawn was giving place\nto day, and even there, in the wood, it was scarce darker than twilight.\n\nYet a little further, and it grew lighter still, and he heard the\nthrostles singing a little way off, and knew that they were on the edge\nof the pine-wood, and still her swift feet sped on till they came to a\nlittle grassy wood-lawn, with nought anear it on the side away from the\nwood save maples and thorn-bushes: it was broad daylight there, though\nthe sun had not yet arisen.\n\nThere she let fall his hand and turned about to him and faced him\nflushed and eager, with her eyes exceeding bright and her lips half\nopen and quivering.  He stood beholding her, trembling, what for\neagerness, what for fear of her words when he had told her of his\ndesire.  For he had now made up his mind to do no less.  He put his\nhelm from off his head and laid it down on the grass, and he noted\ntherewith that she had come in her green gown only, and had left mantle\nand cote hardie behind.\n\nNow he stood up again and was just going to speak, when lo!  she put\nboth her palms to her face, and her bosom heaved, and her shoulders\nwere shaken with sobs, and she burst out a weeping, so that the tears\nran through her fingers.  Then he cast himself on the ground before\nher, and kissed her feet, and clasped her about the knees, and laid his\ncheek to her raiment, and fawned upon her, and cried out many an idle\nword of love, and still she wept a while and spake not.  At last she\nreached her hand down to his face and fondled it, and he let his lips\nlie on the hand, and she suffered it a while, and then took him by the\narm and raised him up and led him on swiftly as before; and he knew not\nwhat to do or say, and durst by no means stay her, and could frame no\nword to ask her wherefore.\n\nSo they sped across a waste not much beset with trees, he silent, she\nnever wearying or slacking her pace or faltering as to the way, till\nthey came into the thick wood again, and ever when he would have spoken\nshe hushed him, with \"Not yet!  Not yet!\" Until at last when the sun\nhad been up for some three hours, she led him through a hazel copse,\nlike a deep hedge, into a cleared grassy place where were great grey\nstones lying about, as if it had been the broken doom-ring of a\nforgotten folk.  There she threw herself down on the grass and buried\nher face amidst the flowers, and was weeping and sobbing again and he\nbending over her, till she turned to him and drew him down to her and\nput her hands to his face, and laid her cheeks all wet with tears to\nhis, and fell to kissing him long and sweetly, so that in his turn he\nwas like to weep for the very sweetness of love.\n\nThen at last she spake:  \"This is the first word, that now I have\nbrought thee away from death; and so sweet it is to me that I can\nscarce bear it.\"\n\n\"Oh, sweet to me,\" he said, \"for I have waited for thee many days.\" And\nhe fell to kissing and clipping her, as one who might not be satisfied.\nAt last she drew herself from him a little, and, turning on him a face\nsmiling with love, she said:  \"Forbear it a little, till we talk\ntogether.\" \"Yea,\" quoth he, \"but may I hold thine hand awhile?\"  \"No\nharm in that,\" she said, laughing, and she gave him her hand and spake:\n\n\"I spake it that I have brought thee from death, and thou hast asked me\nno word concerning what and how.\" \"I will ask it now, then,\" said he,\n\"since thou wilt have it so.\" She said:  \"Dost thou think that he would\nhave let thee live?\"\n\n\"Who,\" said he, \"since thou lettest me live?\"\n\n\"He, thy foeman, the Knight of the Sun,\" she said.  \"Why didst thou not\nflee from him before?  For he did not so much desire to slay thee, but\nthat he would have had thee depart; but if thou wert once at his house,\nhe would thrust a sword through thee, or at the least cast thee into\nhis prison and let thee lie there till thy youth be gone--or so it\nseemed to me,\" she said, faltering as she looked on him.\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"How could I depart when thou wert with him?  Didst thou\nnot see me there?  I was deeming that thou wouldst have me abide.\"\n\nShe looked upon him with such tender love that he made as if he would\ncast himself upon her; but she refrained him, and smiled and said: \"Ah,\nyes, I saw thee, and thought not that thou wouldst sunder thyself from\nme; therefore had I care of thee.\"  And she touched his cheek with her\nother hand; and he sighed and knit his brows somewhat, and said: \"But\nwho is this man that he should slay me?  And why is he thy tyrant, that\nthou must flee from him?\"\n\nShe laughed and said:  \"Fair creature, he is my husband.\"\n\nThen Ralph flushed red, and his visage clouded, and he opened his mouth\nto speak; but she stayed him and said: \"Yet is he not so much my\nhusband but that or ever we were bedded he must needs curse me and\ndrive me away from his house.\" And she smiled, but her face reddened so\ndeeply that her grey eyes looked strange and light therein.\n\nBut Ralph leapt up, and half drew his sword, and cried out loud: \"Would\nGod I had slain him!  Wherefore could I not slay him?\" And he strode up\nand down the sward before her in his wrath.  But she leaned forward to\nhim and laughed and said: \"Yet, O Champion, we will not go back to him,\nfor he is stronger than thou, and hath vanquished thee.  This is a\ndesert place, but thou art loud, and maybe over loud.  Come rest by me.\"\n\nSo he came and sat down by her, and took her hand again and kissed the\nwrist thereof and fondled it and said: \"Yea, but he desireth thee\nsorely; that was easy to see.  It was my ill-luck that I slew him not.\"\n\nShe stroked his face again and said:  \"Long were the tale if I told\nthee all.  After he had driven me out, and I had fled from him, he fell\nin with me again divers times, as was like to be; for his brother is\nthe Captain of the Dry Tree; the tall man whom thou hast seen with me:\nand every time this baron hath come on me he has prayed my love, as one\nwho would die despaired if I granted it not, but O my love with the\nbright sword\" (and she kissed his cheek therewith, and fondled his hand\nwith both her hands), \"each time I said him nay, I said him nay.\" And\nagain her face burned with blushes.\n\n\"And his brother,\" said Ralph, \"the big captain that I have come across\nthese four times, doth he desire thee also?\" She laughed and said:\n\"But as others have, no more: he will not slay any man for my sake.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Didst thou wot that I was abiding thy coming at the\nCastle of Abundance?\"  \"Yea,\" she said, \"have I not told thee that I\nbade Roger lead thee thither?\"  Then she said softly: \"That was after\nthat first time we met; after I had ridden away on the horse of that\nbutcher whom thou slayedst.\"\n\n\"But why camest thou so late?\" said he; \"Wouldst thou have come if I\nhad abided there yet?\"  She said:  \"What else did I desire but to be\nwith thee?  But I set out alone looking not for any peril, since our\nriders had gone to the north against them of the Burg: but as I drew\nnear to the Water of the Oak, I fell in with my husband and that other\nman; and this time all my naysays were of no avail, and whatsoever I\nmight say he constrained me to go with them; but straightway they fell\nout together, and fought, even as thou sawest.\" And she looked at him\nsweetly, and as frankly as if he had been naught but her dearest\nbrother.\n\nBut he said:  \"It was concerning thee that they fought: hast thou known\nthe Black Knight for long?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"I may not hide that he hath loved me: but he hath\nalso betrayed me.  It was through him that the Knight of the Sun drave\nme from him.  Hearken, for this concerneth thee: he made a tale of me\nof true and false mingled, that I was a wise-wife and an enchantress,\nand my lord trowed in him, so that I was put to shame before all the\nhouse, and driven forth wrung with anguish, barefoot and bleeding.\"\n\nHe looked and saw pain and grief in her face, as it had been the shadow\nof that past time, and the fierceness of love in him so changed his\nface, that she arose and drew a little way from him, and stood there\ngazing at him.  But he also rose and knelt before her, and reached up\nfor her hands and took them in his and said: \"Tell me truly, and\nbeguile me not; for I am a young man, and without guile, and I love\nthee, and would have thee for my speech-friend, what woman soever may\nbe in the world.  Whatever thou hast been, what art thou now?  Art thou\ngood or evil?  Wilt thou bless me or ban me?  For it is the truth that\nI have heard tales and tales of thee:  many were good, though it maybe\nstrange; but some, they seemed to warn me of evil in thee.  O look at\nme, and see if I love thee or not! and I may not help it.  Say once for\nall, shall that be for my ruin or my bliss?  If thou hast been evil,\nthen be good this one time and tell me.\"\n\nShe neither reddened now, nor paled at his words, but her eyes filled\nwith tears, and ran over, and she looked down on him as a woman looks\non a man that she loves from the heart's root, and she said:  \"O my\nlord and love, may it be that thou shalt find me no worse to thee than\nthe best of all those tales.  Forsooth how shall I tell thee of myself,\nwhen, whatever I say, thou shalt believe every word I tell thee?  But O\nmy heart, how shouldest thou, so sweet and fair and good, be taken with\nthe love of an evil thing?  At the least I will say this, that\nwhatsoever I have been, I am good to thee--I am good to thee, and will\nbe true to thee.\"\n\nHe drew her down to him as he knelt there, and took his arms about her,\nand though she yet shrank from him a little and the eager flame of his\nlove, he might not be gainsayed, and she gave herself to him and let\nher body glide into his arms, and loved him no less than he loved her.\nAnd there between them in the wilderness was all the joy of love that\nmight be.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThey Break Their Fast in the Wildwood\n\n\nNow when it was hard on noon, and they had lain long in that grassy\nplace, Ralph rose up and stood upon his feet, and made as one\nlistening.  But the Lady looked on him and said: \"It is naught save a\nhart and his hind running in the wood; yet mayhappen we were best on\nthe road, for it is yet long.\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and it may be that\nmy master will gather folk and pursue us.\"  \"Nay, nay,\" she said, \"that\nwere to wrong him, to deem that he would gather folk to follow one man;\nif he come, he will be by himself alone.  When he found us gone he\ndoubtless cast himself on Silverfax, my horse, in trust of the beast\nfollowing after my feet.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ralph, \"and if he come alone, there is yet a sword betwixt\nhim and thee.\"\n\nShe was standing up by him now with her hand on his shoulder, \"Hear now\nthe darling, the champion! how he trusteth well in his heart and his\nright hand.  But nay, I have cared for thee well.  Hearken, if thou\nwilt not take it amiss that I tell thee all I do, good or evil.  I said\na word in the ear of Silverfax or ever I departed, and now the good\nbeast knows my mind, and will lead the fierce lord a little astray, but\nnot too much, lest he follow us with his eager heart and be led by his\nown keen woodcraft.  Indeed, I left the horse behind to that end, else\nhadst thou ridden the woodland ways with me, instead of my wearying\nthee by our going afoot; and thou with thy weapons and wargear.\"\n\nHe looked upon her tenderly, and said smiling:  \"And thou, my dear, art\nthou not a little wearied by what should weary a knight and one bred\nafield?\"  \"Nay,\" she said, \"seest thou not how I walk lightly clad,\nwhereas I have left behind my mantle and cote-hardie?\" Thereat she\ngathered up her gown into her girdle ready for the way, and smiled as\nshe saw his eyes embrace the loveliness of her feet; and she spake as\nshe moved them daintily on the flowery grass: \"Sooth to say, Knight, I\nam no weakling dame, who cannot move her limbs save in the dance, or to\nback the white palfrey and ride the meadows, goshawk on wrist; I am\nboth well-knit and light-foot as the Wood-wife and Goddess of yore\nagone.  Many a toil hath gone to that, whereof I may tell thee\npresently; but now we were best on our way.  Yet before we go, I will\nat least tell thee this, that in my knowing of these woods, there is no\nsorcery at all; for in the woods, though not in these woods, was I\nbred; and here also I am at home, as I may say.\"\n\nHand in hand then they went lightly through the hazel copse, and soon\nwas the wood thick about them, but, as before, the Lady led\nunfalteringly through the thicket paths.  Now Ralph spake and said: \"It\nis good that thou lead me whither thou wilt; but this I may say, that\nit is clear to me that we are not on the way to the Castle of\nAbundance.\" \"Even so,\" said she; \"indeed had I come to thee there, as I\nwas minded, I should presently have brought thee on the way which we\nare wending now, or one nigh to it; and that is that which leadeth to\nHampton under Scaur, and the Fellowship of Champions who dwell on the\nrock.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"It is well; yet will I tell thee the truth, that a little\nsojourn in that fair house had liked me better.  Fain had I been to see\nthee sitting in thine ivory chair in thy chamber of dais with the walls\nhung round with thee woven in pictures--wilt thou not tell me in words\nthe story of those pictures? and also concerning the book which I read,\nwhich was also of thee?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"thou hast read in the book--well, I will tell thee the\nstory very soon, and that the more since there are matters written\nwrong in the book.\"  Therewith she hurried him on, and her feet seemed\nnever tired, though now, to say sooth, he began to go somewhat heavily.\n\nThen she stayed him, and laughed sweetly in his face, and said: \"It is\na long while now since the beginning of the June day, and meseems I\nknow thy lack, and the slaking of it lieth somewhat nearer than Hampton\nunder Scaur, which we shall not reach these two days if we go afoot all\nthe way.\"\n\n\"My lack?\" said he; \"I lack nought now, that I may not have when I\nwill.\" And he put his arms about her shoulders and strained her to his\nbosom.  But she strove with him, and freed herself and laughed\noutright, and said:  \"Thou art a bold man, and rash, my knight, even\nunto me.  Yet must I see to it that thou die not of hunger.\"  He said\nmerrily: \"Yea, by St. Nicholas, true it is:  a while ago I felt no\nhunger, and had forgotten that men eat; for I was troubled with much\nlonging, and in doubt concerning my life; but now am I free and happy,\nand hungry therewithal.\"\n\n\"Look,\" she said, pointing up to the heavens, \"it is now past two hours\nafter noon; that is nigh two hours since we left the lawn amidst the\nhazels, and thou longest to eat, as is but right, so lovely as thou art\nand young; and I withal long to tell thee something of that whereof\nthou hast asked me; and lastly, it is the hottest of the day, yea, so\nhot, that even Diana, the Wood-wife of yore agone, might have fainted\nsomewhat, if she had been going afoot as we twain have been, and little\nis the risk of our resting awhile.  And hereby is a place where rest is\ngood as regards the place, whatever the resters may be; it is a little\naside the straightest way, but meseems we may borrow an hour or so of\nour journey, and hope to pay it back ere nightfall.  Come, champion!\"\n\nTherewith she led north through a thicket of mingled trees till Ralph\nheard water running, and anon they came to a little space about a\nbrook, grassy and clear of trees save a few big thorn-bushes, with a\ngreen ridge or bank on the other side.  There she stayed him and said:\n\"Do off thy war-gear, knight.  There is naught to fear here, less than\nthere was amidst the hazels.\" So did he, and she kneeled down and drank\nof the clear water, and washed her face and hands therein, and then\ncame and kissed him and said:  \"Lovely imp of Upmeads, I have some\nbread of last night's meal in my scrip here, and under the bank I shall\nfind some woodland meat withal; abide a little and the tale and the\nfood shall come back to thee together.\" Therewith she stepped lightly\ninto the stream, and stood therein a minute to let her naked feet feel\nthe cold ripple (for she had stripped off her foot-gear as she first\ncame to the water), and then went hither and thither gathering\nstrawberries about the bank, while he watched her, blessing her, till\nhe well nigh wept at the thought of his happiness.\n\nBack she came in a little while with good store of strawberries in the\nlap of her gown, and they sat down on the green lip of the brook, and\nshe drew the bread from her scrip and they ate together, and she made\nhim drink from the hollow of her hands, and kissed him and wept over\nhim for joy, and the eagerness of her love.  So at last she sat down\nquietly beside him, and fell to speaking to him, as a tale is told in\nthe ingle nook on an even of Yule-tide.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nThe Lady Telleth Ralph of the Past Days of Her Life\n\n\n\"Now shalt thou hear of me somewhat more than the arras and the book\ncould tell thee; and yet not all, for time would fail us therefor--and\nmoreover my heart would fail me.  I cannot tell where I was born nor of\nwhat lineage, nor of who were my father and mother; for this I have\nknown not of myself, nor has any told me.  But when I first remember\nanything, I was playing about a garden, wherein was a little house\nbuilt of timber and thatched with reed, and the great trees of the\nforest were all about the garden save for a little croft which was\ngrown over with high grass and another somewhat bigger, wherein were\ngoats.  There was a woman at the door of the house and she spinning,\nyet clad in glittering raiment, and with jewels on her neck and\nfingers; this was the first thing that I remember, but all as it were a\nmatter of every day, and use and wont, as it goes with the memories of\nchildren.  Of such matters I will not tell thee at large, for thou\nknowest how it will be.  Now the woman, who as I came to know was\nneither old nor young in those days, but of middle age, I called\nmother; but now I know that she was not my mother.  She was hard and\nstern with me, but never beat me in those days, save to make me do what\nI would not have done unbeaten; and as to meat I ate and drank what I\ncould get, as she did, and indeed was well-fed with simple meats as\nthou mayest suppose from the aspect of me to-day. But as she was not\nfierce but rather sour to me in her daily wont in my youngest days so\nalso she was never tender, or ever kissed me or caressed me, for as\nlittle as I was.  And I loved her naught, nor did it ever come into my\nmind that I should love her, though I loved a white goat of ours and\ndeemed it dear and lovely; and afterwards other things also that came\nto me from time to time, as a squirrel that I saved from a weasel, and\na jackdaw that fell from a tall ash-tree nigh our house before he had\nlearned how to fly, and a house-mouse that would run up and down my\nhand and arm, and other such-like things; and shortly I may say that\nthe wild things, even to the conies and fawns loved me, and had but\nlittle fear of me, and made me happy, and I loved them.\n\n\"Further, as I grew up, the woman set me to do such work as I had\nstrength for as needs was; for there was no man dwelt anigh us and\nseldom did I ever see man or woman there, and held no converse with\nany, save as I shall tell thee presently: though now and again a man or\na woman passed by; what they were I knew not, nor their whence and\nwhither, but by seeing them I came to know that there were other folk\nin the world besides us two.  Nought else I knew save how to spin, and\nto tend our goats and milk them, and to set snares for birds and small\ndeer: though when I had caught them, it irked me sore to kill them, and\nI had let them go again had I not feared the carline.  Every day early\nI was put forth from the house and garth, and forbidden to go back\nthither till dusk.  While the days were long and the grass was growing,\nI had to lead our goats to pasture in the wood-lawns, and must take\nwith me rock and spindle, and spin so much of flax or hair as the woman\ngave me, or be beaten.  But when the winter came and the snow was on\nthe ground, then that watching and snaring of wild things was my\nbusiness.\n\n\"At last one day of late summer when I, now of some fifteen summers,\nwas pasturing the goats not far from the house, the sky darkened, and\nthere came up so great a storm of thunder and lightning, and huge drift\nof rain, that I was afraid, and being so near to the house, I hastened\nthither, driving the goats, and when I had tethered them in the shed of\nthe croft, I crept trembling up to the house, and when I was at the\ndoor, heard the clack of the loom in the weaving-chamber, and deemed\nthat the woman was weaving there, but when I looked, behold there was\nno one on the bench, though the shuttle was flying from side to side,\nand the shed opening and changing, and the sley coming home in due\norder.  Therewithal I heard a sound as of one singing a song in a low\nvoice, but the words I could not understand: then terror seized on my\nheart, but I stepped over the threshold, and as the door of the chamber\nwas open, I looked aside and saw therein the woman sitting stark naked\non the floor with a great open book before her, and it was from her\nmouth that the song was coming: grim she looked, and awful, for she was\na big woman, black-haired and stern of aspect in her daily wont,\nspeaking to me as few words as might be, and those harsh enough, yea\nharsher than when I was but little.  I stood for one moment afraid\nbeyond measure, though the woman did not look at me, and I hoped she\nhad not seen me; then I ran back into the storm, though it was now\nwilder than ever, and ran and hid myself in the thicket of the wood,\nhalf-dead with fear, and wondering what would become of me.  But\nfinding that no one followed after me, I grew calmer, and the storm\nalso drew off, and the sun shone out a little before his setting: so I\nsat and spun, with fear in my heart, till I had finished my tale of\nthread, and when dusk came, stole back again to the house, though my\nlegs would scarce bear me over the threshold into the chamber.\n\n\"There sat the woman in her rich attire no otherwise than her wont, nor\ndid she say aught to me; but looked at the yarn that I had spun, to see\nthat I had done my task, and nodded sternly to me as her wont was, and\nI went to bed amongst my goats as I was used to do, but slept not till\ntowards morning, and then images of dreadful things, and of miseries\nthat I may not tell thee of, mingled with my sleep for long.\n\n\"So I awoke and ate my meat and drank of the goats' milk with a heavy\nheart, and then went into the house; and when I came into the chamber\nthe woman looked at me, and contrary to her wont spoke to me, and I\nshook with terror at her voice; though she said naught but this: 'Go\nfetch thy white goat and come back to me therewith.' I did so, and\nfollowed after her, sick with fear; and she led me through the wood\ninto a lawn which I knew well, round which was a wall, as it were, of\ngreat yew trees, and amidst, a table of stone, made of four uprights\nand a great stone plank on the top of them; and this was the only thing\nin all the wood wherein I was used to wander which was of man's\nhandiwork, save and except our house, and the sheds and fences about it.\n\n\"The woman stayed and leaned against this stonework and said to me: 'Go\nabout now and gather dry sticks for a fire.'  I durst do naught else,\nand said to myself that I should be whipped if I were tardy, though,\nforsooth, I thought she was going to kill me; and I brought her a\nbundle, and she said, 'Fetch more.' And when I had brought her seven\nbundles, she said:  'It is enough: stand over against me and hearken.'\nSo I stood there quaking; for my fear, which had somewhat abated while\nI went to and fro after the wood, now came back upon me tenfold.\n\n\"She said:  'It were thy due that I should slay thee here and now, as\nthou slayest the partridges which thou takest in thy springes: but for\ncertain causes I will not slay thee.  Again, it were no more than thy\nearnings were I to torment thee till thou shouldst cry out for death to\ndeliver thee from the anguish; and if thou wert a woman grown, even so\nwould I deal with thee.  But thou art yet but a child, therefore I will\nkeep thee to see what shall befall betwixt us.  Yet must I do somewhat\nto grieve thee, and moreover something must be slain and offered up\nhere on this altar, lest all come to naught, both thou and I, and that\nwhich we have to do.  Hold thy white goat now, which thou lovest more\nthan aught else, that I may redden thee and me and this altar with the\nblood thereof.'\n\n\"I durst do naught but obey her, and I held the poor beast, that licked\nmy hands and bleated for love of me: and now since my terror and the\nfear of death was lessened at her words, I wept sore for my dear friend.\n\n\"But the woman drew a strong sharp knife from her girdle and cut the\nbeast's throat, and dipped her fingers in the blood and reddened both\nherself and me on the breast, and the hands, and the feet; and then she\nturned to the altar and smote blood upon the uprights, and the face of\nthe stone plank.  Then she bade me help her, and we laid the seven\nfaggots on the alter, and laid the carcase of the goat upon them: and\nshe made fire, but I saw not how, and set it to the wood, and when it\nbegan to blaze she stood before it with her arms outspread, and sang\nloud and hoarse to a strange tune; and though I knew not the words of\nher song, it filled me with dread, so that I cast myself down on the\nground and hid my face in the grass.\n\n\"So she went on till the beast was all burned up and the fire became\nnaught but red embers, and then she ceased her song and sank down upon\nthe grass, and laid her head back and so fell asleep; but I durst not\nmove from the place, but cowered in the grass there, I know not how\nlong, till she arose and came to me, and smote me with her foot and\ncried:  'Rise up, fool! what harm hast thou?  Go milk thy goats and\nlead them to pasture.'  And therewith she strode away home, not heeding\nme.\n\n\"As for me, I arose and dealt with my goats as she bade me; and\npresently I was glad that I had not been slain, yet thenceforth was the\njoy of my life that I had had amongst my goats marred with fear, and\nthe sounds of the woodland came to me mingled with terror; and I was\nsore afraid when I entered the house in the morning and the evening,\nand when I looked on the face of the woman; though she was no harder to\nme than heretofore, but maybe somewhat softer.\n\n\"So wore the autumn, and winter came, and I fared as I was wont,\nsetting springes for fowl and small-deer. And for all the roughness of\nthe season, at that time it pleased me better than the leafy days,\nbecause I had less memory then of the sharpness of my fear on that day\nof the altar.  Now one day as I went under the snow-laden trees, I saw\nsomething bright and big lying on the ground, and drawing nearer I saw\nthat it was some child of man:  so I stopped and cried out, 'Awake and\narise, lest death come on thee in this bitter cold,' But it stirred\nnot; so I plucked up heart and came up to it, and lo! a woman clad in\nfair raiment of scarlet and fur, and I knelt down by her to see if I\nmight help her; but when I touched her I found her cold and stiff, and\ndead, though she had not been dead long, for no snow had fallen on her.\nIt still wanted more than an hour of twilight, and I by no means durst\ngo home till nightfall; so I sat on there and watched her, and put the\nhood from her face and the gloves from her hands, and I deemed her a\ngoodly and lovely thing, and was sorry that she was not alive, and I\nwept for her, and for myself also, that I had lost her fellowship.  So\nwhen I came back to the house at dark with the venison, I knew not\nwhether to tell my mistress and tyrant concerning this matter; but she\nlooked on me and said at once: 'Wert thou going to tell me of something\nthat thou hast seen?' So I told her all, even as it was, and she said\nto me: 'Hast thou taken aught from the corpse?'  'Nay,' said I. 'Then\nmust I hasten,' she said, 'and be before the wolves.' Therewith she\ntook a brand from the fire, and bade me bear one also and lead her:  so\ndid I easily enough, for the moon was up, and what with moon and snow,\nit was well nigh as bright as the day.  So when we came to the dead\nwoman, my mistress kneeled down by her and undid the collar of her\ncloak, which I had not touched, and took something from her neck\nswiftly, and yet I, who was holding the torch, saw that it was a\nnecklace of blue stones and green, with gold between--Yea, dear\nChampion, like unto thine as one peascod is to another,\" quoth she.\n\nAnd therewith the distressfulness of her face which had worn Ralph's\nheart while she had been telling her tale changed, and she came, as it\nwere, into her new life and the love of him again, and she kissed him\nand laid her cheek to his and he kissed her mouth.  And then she\nfetched a sigh, and began with her story again.\n\n\"My mistress took the necklace and put it in her pouch, and said as to\nherself:  'Here, then, is another seeker who hath not found, unless one\nshould dig a pit for her here when the thaw comes, and call it the Well\nat the World's End: belike it will be for her as helpful as the real\none.' Then she turned to me and said:  'Do thou with the rest what thou\nwilt,' and therewith she went back hastily to the house.  But as for\nme, I went back also, and found a pick and a mattock in the goat-house,\nand came back in the moonlight and scraped the snow away, and dug a\npit, and buried the poor damsel there with all her gear.\n\n\"Wore the winter thence with naught that I need tell of, only I thought\nmuch of the words that my mistress had spoken.  Spring came and went,\nand summer also, well nigh tidingless.  But one day as I drave the\ngoats from our house there came from the wood four men, a-horseback and\nweaponed, but so covered with their armour that I might see little of\ntheir faces.  They rode past me to our house, and spake not to me,\nthough they looked hard at me; but as they went past I heard one say:\n'If she might but be our guide to the Well at the World's End!' I durst\nnot tarry to speak with them, but as I looked over my shoulder I saw\nthem talking to my mistress in the door; but meseemed she was clad but\nin poor homespun cloth instead of her rich apparel, and I am\nfar-sighted and clear-sighted. After this the autumn and winter that\nfollowed it passed away tidingless.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nThe Lady Tells of Her Deliverance\n\n\n\"Now I had outgrown my old fear, and not much befell to quicken it: and\never I was as much out of the house as I could be.  But about this time\nmy mistress, from being kinder to me than before, began to grow harder,\nand ofttimes used me cruelly:  but of her deeds to me, my friend, thou\nshalt ask me no more than I tell thee.  On a day of May-tide I fared\nabroad with my goats, and went far with them, further from the house\nthan I had been as yet.  The day was the fairest of the year, and I\nrejoiced in it, and felt as if some exceeding great good were about to\nbefall me; and the burden of fears seemed to have fallen from me.  So I\nwent till I came to a little flowery dell, beset with blossoming\nwhitethorns and with a fair stream running through it; a place somewhat\nlike to this, save that the stream there was bigger.  And the sun was\nhot about noontide, so I did off my raiment, which was rough and poor,\nand more meet for winter than May-tide, and I entered a pool of the\nclear water, and bathed me and sported therein, smelling the sweet\nscent of the whitethorns and hearkening to the song of the many birds;\nand when I came forth from the water, the air was so soft and sweet to\nme, and the flowery grass so kind to my feet, and the May-blooms fell\nupon my shoulders, that I was loth to do on my rough raiment hastily,\nand withal I looked to see no child of man in that wilderness: so I\nsported myself there a long while, and milked a goat and drank of the\nmilk, and crowned myself with white-thorn and hare-bells; and held the\nblossoms in my hand, and felt that I also had some might in me, and\nthat I should not be a thrall of that sorceress for ever.  And that\nday, my friend, belike was the spring-tide of the life and the love\nthat thou holdest in thy kind arms.\n\n\"But as I abode thus in that fair place, and had just taken my rock and\nspindle in hand that I might go on with my task and give as little\noccasion as I might for my mistress to chastise me, I looked up and saw\na child of man coming down the side of the little dale towards me, so I\nsprang up, and ran to my raiment and cast them on me hastily, for I was\nashamed; and when I saw that it was a woman, I thought at first that it\nwas my mistress coming to seek me; and I thought within myself that if\nshe smote me I would bear it no more, but let it be seen which of the\ntwain was the mightier.  But I looked again and saw that it was not she\nbut a woman smaller and older.  So I stood where I was and abode her\ncoming, smiling and unafraid, and half-clad.\n\n\"She drew near and I saw that it was an old woman grey haired, uncomely\nof raiment, but with shining bright eyes in her wrinkled face.  And she\nmade an obeisance to me and said:  'I was passing through this lonely\nwilderness and I looked down into the little valley and saw these goats\nthere and the lovely lady lying naked amongst them, and I said I am too\nold to be afraid of aught; for if she be a goddess come back again from\nyore agone, she can but make an end of a poor old carline, a gangrel\nbody, who hath no joy of her life now.  And if she be of the daughters\nof men, she will belike methink her of her mother, and be kind to me\nfor her sake, and give me a piece of bread and a draught of her goats'\nmilk.'\n\n\"I spake hastily, for I was ashamed of her words, though I only half\nunderstood them:  'I hear thee and deem that thou mockest me: I have\nnever known a mother; I am but a poor thrall, a goatherd dwelling with\na mistress in a nook of this wildwood: I have never a piece of bread;\nbut as to the goats' milk, that thou shalt have at once.'  So I called\none of my goats to me, for I knew them all, and milked her into a\nwooden bowl that I carried slung about me, and gave the old woman to\ndrink: and she kissed my hand and drank and spake again, but no longer\nin a whining voice, like a beggar bidding alms in the street, but frank\nand free.\n\n\"'Damsel,' she said, 'now I see that thy soul goes with thy body, and\nthat thou art kind and proud at once.  And whatever thou art, it is no\nmock to say of thee, that thou art as fair as the fairest; and I think\nthat this will follow thee, that henceforth no man who seeth thee once\nwill forget thee ever, or cease to long for thee: of a surety this is\nthy weird.  Now I see that thou knowest no more of the world and its\nways than one of the hinds that run in these woods.  So if thou wilt, I\nwill sit down by thee and tell thee much that shall avail thee; and\nthou in thy turn shalt tell me all the tale concerning thy dwelling and\nthy service, and the like.'\n\n\"I said, 'I may not, I durst not; I serve a mighty mistress, and she\nwould slay me if she knew that I had spoken to thee; and woe's me!  I\nfear that even now she will not fail to know it.  Depart in peace.'\n\n\"'Nay,' she said, 'thou needest not tell me, for I have an inkling of\nher and her ways:  but I will give thee wisdom, and not sell it thee at\na price.  Sit down then, fair child, on this flowery grass, and I will\nsit beside thee and tell thee of many things worth thine heeding.' So\nthere we sat awhile, and in good sooth she told me much of the world\nwhich I had not yet seen, of its fairness and its foulness; of life and\ndeath, and desire and disappointment, and despair; so that when she had\ndone, if I were wiser than erst, I was perchance little more joyous;\nand yet I said to myself that come what would I would be a part of all\nthat.\n\n\"But at last she said:  'Lo the day is waning, and thou hast two things\nto do; either to go home to thy mistress at once, or flee away from her\nby the way that I shall show thee; and if thou wilt be ruled by me, and\ncanst bear thy thralldom yet a little while thou wilt not flee at once,\nbut abide till thou hast seen me again.  And since it is here that thou\nhast met me, here mayst thou meet me again; for the days are long now,\nand thou mayst easily win thy way hither before noon on any day.'\n\n\"So I tied my goatskin shoes to my feet, and drave my goats together,\nand we went up together out of the dale, and were in the wide-spreading\nplain of the waste; and the carline said: 'Dost thou know the quarters\nof the heaven by the sun?' 'Yea,' said I. 'Then,' quoth she, 'whenso\nthou desirest to depart and come into the world of folk that I have\ntold thee of, set thy face a little north of west, and thou shalt fall\nin with something or somebody before long; but be speedy on that day as\nthou art light-footed, and make all the way thou canst before thy\nmistress comes to know of thy departure; for not lightly will any one\nlet loose such a thrall as thou.'\n\n\"I thanked her, and she went her ways over the waste, I wotted not\nwhither, and I drave my goats home as speedily as I might; the mistress\nmeddled not with me by word or deed, though I was short of my due tale\nof yarn.  The next day I longed sore to go to the dale and meet the\ncarline but durst not, and the next day I fared in likeways; but the\nthird day I longed so to go, that my feet must needs take me there,\nwhatsoever might befall.  And when I had been in the dale a little,\nthither came the carline, and sat down by me and fell to teaching me\nwisdom, and showed me letters and told me what they were, and I learned\nlike a little lad in the chorister's school.\n\n\"Thereafter I mastered my fear of my mistress and went to that dale day\nby day, and learned of the carline; though at whiles I wondered when my\nmistress would let loose her fury upon me; for I called to mind the\nthreat she had made to me on the day when she offered up my white goat.\nAnd I made up my mind to this, that if she fell upon me with deadly\nintent I would do my best to slay her before she should slay me.  But\nso it was, that now again she held her hand from my body, and scarce\ncast a word at me ever, but gloomed at me, and fared as if hatred of me\nhad grown great in her heart.\n\n\"So the days went by, and my feet had worn a path through the\nwilderness to the Dale of Lore, and May had melted into June, and the\nlatter days of June were come.  And on Midsummer Day I went my ways to\nthe dale according to my wont, when, as I as driving on my goats\nhastily I saw a bright thing coming over the heath toward me, and I\nwent on my way to meet it, for I had no fear now, except what fear of\nmy mistress lingered in my heart; nay, I looked that everything I saw\nof new should add some joy to my heart.  So presently I saw that it was\na weaponed man riding a white horse, and anon he had come up to me and\ndrawn rein before me.  I wondered exceedingly at beholding him and the\nheart leaped within me at his beauty; for though the carline had told\nme of the loveliness of the sons of men, that was but words and I knew\nnot what they meant; and the others that I had seen were not young men\nor goodly, and those last, as I told thee, I could scarce see their\nfaces.\n\n\"And this one was even fairer than the dead woman that I had buried,\nwhose face was worn with toil and trouble, as now I called to mind.  He\nwas clad in bright shining armour with a gay surcoat of green,\nembroidered with flowers over it; he had a light sallet on his head,\nand the yellow locks of his hair flowed down from under, and fell on\nhis shoulders:  his face was as beardless as thine, dear friend, but\nnot clear brown like to thine but white and red like a blossom.\"\n\nRalph spake and said:  \"Belike it was a woman;\" and his voice sounded\nloud in the quiet place.  She smiled on him and kissed his cheek, and\nsaid:  \"Nay, nay, dear Champion, it is not so.  God rest his soul! many\na year he has been dead.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Many a year! what meanest thou?\"  \"Ah!\" she said, \"fear\nnot! as I am now, so shall I be for thee many a year.  Was not thy fear\nthat I should vanish away or change into something unsightly and\ngruesome?  Fear not, I say; am I not a woman, and thine own?\" And again\nshe flushed bright red, and her grey eyes lightened, and she looked at\nhim all confused and shamefaced.\n\nHe took her face between his hands and kissed her over and over; then\nhe let her go, and said:  \"I have no fear: go on with thy tale, for the\nwords thereof are as thy kisses to me, and the embracing of thine hands\nand thy body: tell on, I pray thee.\"  She took his hand in hers and\nspake, telling her tale as before.\n\n\"Friend, well-beloved for ever!  This fair young knight looked on me,\nand as he looked, his face flushed as red as mine did even now.  And I\ntell thee that my heart danced with joy as I looked on him, and he\nspake not for a little while, and then he said: 'Fair maiden, canst\nthou tell me of any who will tell me a word of the way to the Well at\nthe World's End?'  I said to him, 'Nay, I have heard the word once and\nno more, I know not the way: and I am sorry that I cannot do for thee\nthat which thou wouldest.' And then I spake again, and told him that he\nshould by no means stop at our house, and I told him what it was like,\nso that he might give it the go by.  I said, 'Even if thou hast to turn\nback again, and fail to find the thing thou seekest, yet I beseech thee\nride not into that trap.'\n\n\"He sat still on his saddle a while, staring at me and I at him; and\nthen he thanked me, but with so bad a grace, that I wondered of him if\nhe were angry; and then he shook his rein, and rode off briskly, and I\nlooked after him a while, and then went on my way; but I had gone but a\nshort while, when I heard horse-hoofs behind me, and I turned and\nlooked, and lo! it was the knight coming back again.  So I stayed and\nabided him; and when he came up to me, he leapt from his horse and\nstood before me and said:  'I must needs see thee once again.'\n\n\"I stood and trembled before him, and longed to touch him.  And again\nhe spake, breathlessly, as one who has been running: 'I must depart,\nfor I have a thing to do that I must do; but I long sorely to touch\nthee, and kiss thee; yet unless thou freely willest it, I will refrain\nme.'  Then I looked at him and said, 'I will it freely.'  Then he came\nclose up to me, and put his hand on my shoulder and kissed my cheek;\nbut I kissed his lips, and then he took me in his arms, and kissed me\nand embraced me; and there in that place, and in a little while, we\nloved each other sorely.\n\n\"But in a while he said to me:  'I must depart, for I am as one whom\nthe Avenger of Blood followeth; and now I will give thee this, not so\nmuch as a gift, but as a token that we have met in the wilderness, thou\nand I.' Therewith he put his hand to his neck, and took from it this\nnecklace which thou seest here, and I saw that it was like that which\nmy mistress took from the neck of the dead woman.  And no less is it\nlike to the one that thou wearest, Ralph.\n\n\"I took it in my hand and wept that I might not help him.  And he said:\n'It is little likely that we shall meet again; but by the token of this\ncollar thou mayest wot that I ever long for thee till I die:  for\nthough I am a king's son, this is the dearest of my possessions.'  I\nsaid: 'Thou art young, and I am young; mayhappen we shall meet again:\nbut thou shalt know that I am but a thrall, a goatherd.' For I knew by\nwhat the old woman told me of somewhat of the mightiness of the kings\nof the world.  'Yea,' he said, and smiled most sweetly, 'that is easy\nto be seen: yet if I live, as I think not to do, thou shalt sit where\ngreat men shall kneel to thee; not as I kneel now for love, and that I\nmay kiss thy knees and thy feet, but because they needs must worship\nthee.'\n\n\"Therewith he arose to his feet and leapt on his horse, and rode his\nways speedily:  and I went upon my way with my goats, and came down\ninto the Dale of Lore, and found the old woman abiding me; and she came\nto me, and took me by the hands, and touched the collar (for I had done\nit about my neck), and said:\n\n\"'Dear child, thou needest not to tell me thy tale, for I have seen\nhim.  But if thou must needs wear this necklace, I must give thee a\ngift to go with it.  But first sit down by the old carline awhile and\ntalk with her; for meseemeth it will be but a few days ere thou shalt\ndepart from this uttermost wilderness, and the woods before the\nmountains.'\n\n\"So I sat down by her, and in spite of her word I told her all that had\nbefallen betwixt me and the king's son:  for my heart was too full that\nI might refrain me.  She nodded her head from time to time, but said\nnaught, till I had made an end:  and then fell to telling me of many\nmatters for my avail; but yet arose earlier than her wont was; and when\nwe were about sundering on the path which I had trodden above the Dale,\nshe said: 'Now must I give thee that gift to go along with the gift of\nthe lover, the King's son; and I think thou wilt find it of avail\nbefore many days are gone by.'  Therewith she took from her pouch a\nstrong sharp knife, and drew it from the sheath, and flashed it in the\nafternoon sun, and gave it to me; and I took it and laid it in my bosom\nand thanked her; for I thought that I understood her meaning, and how\nit would avail me.  Then I went driving my goats home speedily, so that\nthe sun was barely set when I came to the garth; and a great horror\nrather than a fear of my mistress was on me; and lo! she stood in the\ndoor of the house gazing down the garth and the woodland beyond, as\nthough she were looking for my coming: and when her eyes lighted on me,\nshe scowled, and drew her lips back from her teeth and clenched her\nhands with fury, though there was nought in them; and she was a tall\nand strong woman, though now growing somewhat old: but as for me, I had\nunsheathed the carline's gift before I came to the garth, and now I\nheld it behind my back in my left hand.\n\n\"I had stayed my feet some six paces from the threshold, and my heart\nbeat quick, but the sick fear and cowering had left me, though the\nhorror of her grew in my heart.  My goats had all gone off quietly to\ntheir house, and there was nothing betwixt me and her.  In clearing\nfrom my sleeve the arm of me which held the knife, the rough clasp\nwhich fastened my raiment together at the shoulder had given way, and\nthe cloth had fallen and left my bosom bare, so that I knew that the\ncollar was clearly to be seen.  So we stood a moment, and I had no\nwords, but she spake at last in a hard, snarling voice, such as she\noftenest used to me, but worse.\n\n\"'Now at last the time has come when thou art of no more use to me; for\nI can see thee what thou hast got for thyself.  But know now that thou\nhast not yet drunk of the Well at the World's End, and that it will not\navail thee to flee out of this wood; for as long as I live thou wilt\nnot be able to get out of reach of my hand; and I shall live long: I\nshall live long.  Come, then, and give thyself up to me, that I may\ndeal with thee as I threatened when I slew thy friend the white goat;\nfor, indeed, I knew then that it would come to this.'\n\n\"She had but twice or thrice spoken to me so many words together as\nthis; but I answered never a word, but stood watching her warily.  And\nof a sudden she gave forth a dreadful screaming roar, wherewith all the\nwood rang again, and rushed at me; but my hand came from behind my\nback, and how it was I know not, but she touched me not till the blade\nhad sunk into her breast, and she fell across my feet, her right hand\nclutching my raiment.  So I loosed her fingers from the cloth,\nshuddering with horror the while, and drew myself away from her and\nstood a little aloof, wondering what should happen next.  And indeed I\nscarce believed but she would presently rise up from the ground and\nclutch me in her hands, and begin the tormenting of me.  But she moved\nno more, and the grass all about her was reddened with her blood; and\nat last I gathered heart to kneel down beside her, and found that she\nno more breathed than one of those conies or partridges which I had\nbeen used to slay for her.\n\n\"Then I stood and considered what I should do, and indeed I had been\npondering this all the way from the Dale thereto, in case I should\nescape my mistress.  So I soon made up my mind that I would not dwell\nin that house even for one night; lest my mistress should come to me\nthough dead, and torment me.  I went into the house while it was yet\nlight, and looked about the chamber, and saw three great books there\nlaid on the lectern, but durst not have taken them even had I been able\nto carry them; nor durst I even to look into them, for fear that some\nspell might get to work in them if they were opened; but I found a rye\nloaf whereof I had eaten somewhat in the morning, and another\nuntouched, and hanging to a horn of the lectern I found the necklace\nwhich my mistress had taken from the dead woman.  These I put into my\nscrip, and as to the necklace, I will tell thee how I bestowed it later\non.  Then I stepped out into the twilight which was fair and golden,\nand full fain I was of it.  Then I drove the goats out of their house\nand went my way towards the Dale of Lore, and said to myself that the\ncarline would teach me what further to do, and I came there before the\nsummer dark had quite prevailed, and slept sweetly and softly amongst\nmy goats after I had tethered them in the best of the pasture.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nYet More of the Lady's Story\n\n\n\"Lo thou, beloved,\" she said, \"thou hast seen me in the wildwood with\nlittle good quickened in me:  doth not thine heart sink at the thought\nof thy love and thy life given over to the keeping of such an one?\"  He\nsmiled in her face, and said: \"Belike thou hast done worse than all\nthou hast told me: and these days past I have wondered often what there\nwas in the stories which they of the Burg had against thee: yet sooth\nto say, they told little of what thou hast done: no more belike than\nbeing their foe.\"  She sighed and said: \"Well, hearken; yet shall I not\ntell thee every deed that I have been partaker in.\n\n\"I sat in the Dale that next day and was happy, though I longed to see\nthat fair man again:  sooth to say, since my mistress was dead,\neverything seemed fairer to me, yea even mine own face, as I saw it in\nthe pools of the stream, though whiles I wondered when I should have\nanother mistress, and how she would deal with me; and ever I said I\nwould ask the carline when she came again to me.  But all that day she\ncame not:  nor did I marvel thereat.  But when seven days passed and\nstill she came not, I fell to wondering what I should do:  for my bread\nwas all gone, and I durst not go back to the house to fetch meal;\nthough there was store of it there.  Howbeit, I drank of the milk of\nthe goats, and made curds thereof with the woodland roots, and ate of\nthe wood-berries like as thou hast done, friend, e'en now.  And it was\neasier for me to find a livelihood in the woods than it had been for\nmost folk, so well as I knew them.  So wore the days, and she came not,\nand I began to think that I should see the wise carline no more, as\nindeed fell out at that time; and the days began to hang heavy on my\nhands, and I fell to thinking of that way to the west and the peopled\nparts, whereof the carline had told me; and whiles I went out of the\nDale and went away hither and thither through the woods, and so far,\nthat thrice I slept away out of the Dale: but I knew that the peopled\nparts would be strange to me and I feared to face them all alone.\n\n\"Thus wore the days till July was on the wane, and on a morning early I\nawoke with unwonted sounds in mine ears; and when my eyes were fairly\nopen I saw a man standing over me and a white horse cropping the grass\nhard by.  And my heart was full and fain, and I sprang to my feet and\nshowed him a smiling happy face, for I saw at once that it was that\nfair man come back again.  But lo! his face was pale and worn, though\nhe looked kindly on me, and he said:  'O my beloved, I have found thee,\nbut I am faint with hunger and can speak but little.' And even\ntherewith he sank down on the grass.  But I bestirred myself, and gave\nhim milk of my goats, and curds and berries, and the life came into him\nagain, and I sat down by him and laid his head in my lap, and he slept\na long while; and when he awoke (and it was towards sunset) he kissed\nmy hands and my arms, and said to me:  'Fair child, perhaps thou wilt\ncome with me now; and even if thou art a thrall thou mayest flee with\nme; for my horse is strong and fat, though I am weak, for he can make\nhis dinner on the grass.'\n\n\"Then he laughed and I no less; but I fed him with my poor victual\nagain, and as he ate I said:  'I am no mistress's thrall now; for the\nevening of the day whereon I saw thee I slew her, else had she slain\nme.' 'The saints be praised,' said he:  'Thou wilt come with me, then?'\n'O yea,' said I. Then I felt shamefaced and I reddened; but I said: 'I\nhave abided here many days for a wise woman who hath taught me many\nthings; but withal I hoped that thou wouldst come also.'\n\n\"Then he put his arms about my shoulders and loved me much; but at last\nhe said:  'Yet is it now another thing than that which I looked for,\nwhen I talked of setting thee by me on the golden throne.  For now am I\na beaten man; I have failed of that I sought, and suffered shame and\nhunger and many ills.  Yet ever I thought that I might find thee here\nor hereby.' Then a thought came into my mind, and I said:  'Else maybe\nthou hadst found what thou soughtest, and overcome the evil things.'\n'Maybe,' he said; 'it is now but a little matter.'\"\n\n\"As for me, I could have no guess at what were the better things he had\nmeant for me, and my heart was full of joy, and all seemed better than\nwell.  And we talked together long till the day was gone.  Then we\nkissed and embraced each other in the Dale of Lore, and the darkness of\nsummer seemed but short for our delight.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nThe Lady Tells Somewhat of Her Doings After She Left the Wilderness\n\n\nRalph stayed her speech now, and said:  \"When I asked of thee in the\nLand of Abundance, there were some who seemed to say that thou hast let\nmore men love thee than one: and it was a torment to me to think that\neven so it might be.  But now when thine own mouth telleth me of one of\nthem it irks me little.  Dost thou think it little-hearted in me?\"\n\n\"O friend,\" she said, \"I see that so it is with thee that thou wouldst\nfind due cause for loving me, whatever thou foundest true of me.  Or\ndost thou deem that I was another woman in those days?  Nay, I was not:\nI can see myself still myself all along the way I have gone.\" She was\nsilent a little, and then she said:  \"Fear not, I will give thee much\ncause to love me.  But now I know thy mind the better, I shall tell\nthee less of what befell me after I left the wilderness; for whatever I\ndid and whatever I endured, still it was always I myself that was\nthere, and it is me that thou lovest.  Moreover, my life in the\nwilderness is a stranger thing to tell thee of than my dealings with\nthe folk, and with Kings and Barons and Knights.  But thereafter thou\nshalt hear of me what tales thou wilt of these matters, as the days and\nthe years pass over our heads.\n\n\"Now on the morrow we would not depart at once, because there we had\nsome victual, and the king's son was not yet so well fed as he should\nbe; so we abode in that fair place another day, and then we went our\nways westward, according to the rede of the carline; and it was many\ndays before we gat us out of the wilderness, and we were often hard put\nto it for victual; whiles I sat behind my knight a-horseback, whiles he\nled the beast while I rode alone, and not seldom I went afoot, and that\nnowise slowly, while he rode the white horse, for I was as light-foot\nthen as now.\n\n\"And of the way we went I will tell thee nought as now, because sure it\nis that if we both live, thou and I shall tread that road together, but\nwith our faces turned the other way; for it is the road from the Well\nat the World's End, where I myself have been, or else never had thine\neyes fallen on me.\"\n\nRalph said, \"Even so much I deemed by reading in the book; yet it was\nnot told clearly that thou hadst been there.\" \"Yea,\" she said, because\nthe said book was made not by my friends but my foes, and they would\nhave men deem that my length of days and the endurance of my beauty and\nnever-dying youth of my heart came from evil and devilish sources; and\nif thou wilt trust my word it is not so, for in the Well at the World's\nEnd is no evil, but only the Quenching of Sorrow, and Clearing of the\nEyes that they may behold.  And how good it is that they look on thee\nnow.  And moreover, the history of that book is partly false of\nintention and ill-will, and partly a confused medley of true and false,\nwhich has come of mere chance-hap.\n\n\"Hearken now,\" she said, \"till I tell thee in few words what befell me\nbefore I came to drink the Water of the Well.  After we had passed long\ndeserts of wood and heath, and gone through lands exceeding evil and\nperilous, and despaired of life for the horror of those places, and\nseen no men, we came at last amongst a simple folk who dealt kindly\nwith us, yea, and more.  These folk seemed to me happy and of good\nwealth, though to my lord they seemed poor and lacking of the goods of\nthe world.  Forsooth, by that time we lacked more than they, for we\nwere worn with cold and hunger, and hard life: though for me, indeed,\nhappy had been the days of my wayfaring, but my lord remembered the\ndays of his riches and the kingdom of his father, and the worship of\nmighty men, and all that he had promised me on the happy day when I\nfirst beheld him: so belike he was scarce so happy as I was.\n\n\"It was springtime when we came to that folk; for we had worn through\nthe autumn and winter in getting clear of the wilderness.  Not that the\nway was long, as I found out afterwards, but that we went astray in the\nwoodland, and at last came out of it into a dreadful stony waste which\nwe strove to cross thrice, and thrice were driven back into the\ngreenwood by thirst and hunger; but the fourth time, having gotten us\nstore of victual by my woodcraft, we overpassed it and reached the\npeopled country.\n\n\"Yea, spring was on the earth, as we, my lord and I, came down from the\ndesolate stony heaths, and went hand and hand across the plain, where\nmen and women of that folk were feasting round about the simple roofs\nand woodland halls which they had raised there.  Then they left their\ngames and sports and ran to us, and we walked on quietly, though we\nknew not whether the meeting was to be for death or life.  But that\nkind folk gathered round us, and asked us no story till they had fed\nus, and bathed us, and clad us after their fashion.  And then, despite\nthe nakedness and poverty wherein they had first seen us, they would\nhave it that we were gods sent down to them from the world beyond the\nmountains by their fathers of old time; for of Holy Church, and the\nBlessed Trinity, and the Mother of God they knew no more than did I at\nthat time, but were heathen, as the Gentiles of yore agone.  And even\nwhen we put all that Godhood from us, and told them as we might and\ncould what we were (for we had no heart to lie to such simple folk),\ntheir kindness abated nothing, and they bade us abide there, and were\nour loving friends and brethren.\n\n\"There in sooth had I been content to abide till eld came upon me, but\nmy lord would not have it so, but longed for greater things for me.\nThough in sooth to me it seemed as if his promise of worship of me by\nthe folk had been already fulfilled; for when we had abided there some\nwhile, and our beauty, which had been marred by the travail of our\nway-faring, had come back to us in full, or it maybe increased\nsomewhat, they did indeed deal with us with more love than would most\nmen with the saints, were they to come back on the earth again; and\ntheir children would gather round about me and make me a partaker of\ntheir sports, and be loth to leave me; and the faces of their old folk\nwould quicken and gladden when I drew nigh: and as for their young men,\nit seemed of them that they loved the very ground that my feet trod on,\nthough it grieved me that I could not pleasure some of them in such\nwise as they desired.  And all this was soft and full of delight for my\nsoul: and I, whose body a little while ago had been driven to daily\ntoil with evil words and stripes, and who had known not what words of\nthanks and praise might mean!\n\n\"But so it must be that we should depart, and the kind folk showed us\nhow sore their hearts were of our departure, but they gainsaid us in\nnowise, but rather furthered us all they might, and we went our ways\nfrom them riding on horned neat (for they knew not of horses), and\ndriving one for a sumpter beast before us; and they had given us bows\nand arrows for our defence, and that we might get us venison.\n\n\"It is not to be said that we did not encounter perils; but thereof I\nwill tell thee naught as now.  We came to other peoples, richer and\nmightier than these, and I saw castles, and abbies, and churches, and\nwalled towns, and wondered at them exceedingly.  And in these places\nfolk knew of the kingdom of my lord and his father, and whereas they\nwere not of his foes (who lay for the more part on the other side of\nhis land), and my lord could give sure tokens of what he was, we were\ntreated with honour and worship, and my lord began to be himself again,\nand to bear him as a mighty man.  And here to me was some gain in that\npoverty and nakedness wherewith we came out of the mountains and the\nraiment of the simple folk; for had I been clad in my poor cloth and\ngoat-skins of the House of the Sorcerer, and he in his brave attire and\nbright armour, they would have said, it is a thrall that he is assotted\nof, and would have made some story and pretence of taking me from him;\nbut they deemed me a great lady indeed, and a king's daughter,\naccording to the tale that he told them.  Forsooth many men that saw me\ndesired me beyond measure, and assuredly some great proud man or other\nwould have taken me from my lord, but that they feared the wrath of his\nfather, who was a mighty man indeed.\n\n\"Yea, one while as we sojourned by a certain town but a little outside\nthe walls, a certain young man, a great champion and exceeding\nmasterful, came upon me with his squires as I was walking in the\nmeadows, and bore me off, and would have taken me to his castle, but\nthat my lord followed with a few of the burghers, and there was a\nbattle fought, wherein my lord was hurt; but the young champion he\nslew; and I cannot say but I was sorry of his death, though glad of my\ndeliverance.\n\n\"Again, on a time we guested in a great baron's house, who dealt so\nfoully by us that he gave my lord a sleeping potion in his good-night\ncup, and came to me in the dead night and required me of my love; and I\nwould not, and he threatened me sorely, and called me a thrall and a\ncastaway that my lord had picked up off the road: but I gat a knife in\nmy hand and was for warding myself when I saw that my lord might not\nwake:  so the felon went away for that time.  But on the morrow came\ntwo evil men into the hall whom he had suborned, and bore false witness\nthat I was a thrall and a runaway.  So that the baron would have held\nme there (being a mighty man) despite my lord and his wrath and his\ngrief, had not a young knight of his house been, who swore that he\nwould slay him unless he let us go; and whereas there were other\nknights and squires there present who murmured, the baron was in a way\ncompelled.  So we departed, and divers of the said knights and squires\nwent with us to see us safe on the way.\n\n\"But this was nigh to the kingdom of my lord's father, and that felon\nbaron I came across again, and he was ever after one of my worst foes.\n\n\"Moreover, that young champion who had first stood up in the hall rode\nwith us still, when the others had turned back; and I soon saw of him\nthat he found it hard to keep his eyes off me; and that also saw my\nlord, and it was a near thing that they did not draw sword thereover:\nyet was that knight no evil man, but good and true, and I was\nexceedingly sorry for him; but I could not help him in the only way he\nwould take help of me.\n\n\"Lo you, my friend, the beginnings of evil in those long past days, and\nthe seeds of ill-hap sown in the field of my new life even before the\nfurrow was turned.\n\n\"Well, we came soon into my lord's country, and fair and rich and\nlovely was it in those days; free from trouble and unpeace, a happy\nabode for the tillers of the soil, and the fashioners of wares.  The\ntidings had gone to the king that my lord was come back, and he came to\nmeet him with a great company of knights and barons, arrayed in the\nnoblest fashion that such folk use; so that I was bewildered with their\nglory, and besought my lord to let me fall back out of the way, and\nperchance he might find me again.  But he bade me ride on his right\nhand, for that I was the half of his life and his soul, and that my\nfriends were his friends and my foes his foes.\n\n\"Then there came to me an inkling of the things that should befall, and\nI saw that the sweet and clean happiness of my new days was marred, and\nhad grown into something else, and I began to know the pain of strife\nand the grief of confusion:  but whereas I had not been bred\ndelicately, but had endured woes and griefs from my youngest days, I\nwas not abashed, but hardened my heart to face all things, even as my\nlord strove to harden his heart:  for, indeed, I said to myself that if\nI was to him as the half of his life, he was to me little less than the\nwhole of my life.\n\n\"It is as if it had befallen yesterday, my friend, that I call to mind\nhow we stood beside our horses in the midst of the ring of great men\nclad in gold and gleaming with steel, in the meadow without the gates,\nthe peace and lowly goodliness whereof with its flocks and herds\nfeeding, and husbandmen tending the earth and its increase, that great\nand noble array had changed so utterly.  There we stood, and I knew\nthat the eyes of all those lords and warriors were set upon me\nwondering.  But the love of my lord and the late-learned knowledge of\nmy beauty sustained me.  Then the ring of men opened, and the king came\nforth towards us; a tall man and big, of fifty-five winters, goodly of\nbody and like to my lord to look upon.  He cast his arms about my lord,\nand kissed him and embraced him, and then stood a little aloof from him\nand said: 'Well, son, hast thou found it, the Well at the World's End?'\n\n\"'Yea,' said my lord, and therewith lifted my hand to his lips and\nkissed it, and I looked the king in his face, and his eyes were turned\nto me, but it was as if he were looking through me at something behind\nme.\n\n\"Then he said:  'It is good, son:  come home now to thy mother and thy\nkindred.'  Then my lord turned to me while the king took no heed, and\nno man in the ring of knights moved from his place, and he set me in\nthe saddle, and turned about to mount, and there came a lord from the\nring of men gloriously bedight, and he bowed lowly before my lord, and\nheld his stirrup for him: but lightly he leapt up into the saddle, and\ntook my reins and led me along with him, so that he and the king and I\nwent on together, and all the baronage and their folk shouted and\ntossed sword and spear aloft and followed after us.  And we left the\nmeadow quiet and simple again, and rode through the gate of the king's\nchief city, wherein was his high house and his castle, the\ndwelling-place of his kindred from of old.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nThe Lady Tells of the Strife and Trouble That Befell After Her Coming\nto the Country of the King's Son\n\n\n\"When we came to the King's House, my lord followed his father into the\nhall, where sat his mother amongst her damsels: she was a fair woman,\nand looked rather meek than high-hearted; my lord led me up to her, and\nshe embraced and kissed him and caressed him long; then she turned\nabout to me and would have spoken to me, but the king, who stood behind\nus, scowled on her, and she forebore; but she looked me on somewhat\nkindly, and yet as one who is afeard.\n\n\"Thus it went for the rest of the day, and my lord had me to sit beside\nhim in the great hall when the banquet was holden, and I ate and drank\nwith him and beheld all the pageants by his side, and none meddled with\nme either to help or to hinder, because they feared the king.  Yet many\neyes I saw that desired my beauty.  And so when night came, he took me\nto his chamber and his bed, as if I were his bride new wedded, even as\nit had been with us on the grass of the wilderness and the bracken of\nthe wildwood.  And then, at last, he spake to me of our case, and bade\nme fear not, for that a band of his friends, all-armed, was keeping\nwatch and ward in the cloister without.  And when I left the chamber on\nthe morrow's morn, there were they yet, all in bright armour, and\namongst them the young knight who had delivered me from the felon\nbaron, and he looked mournfully at me, so that I was sorry for his\nsorrow.\n\n\"And I knew now that the king was minded to slay me, else had he bidden\nthrust me from my lord's side.\n\n\"So wore certain days; and on the seventh night, when we were come into\nour chamber, which was a fair as any house outside of heaven, my lord\nspake to me in a soft voice, and bade me not do off my raiment.  'For,'\nsaid he, 'this night we must flee the town, or we shall be taken and\ncast into prison to-morrow; for thus hath my father determined.' I\nkissed him and clung to him, and he no less was good to me.  And when\nit was the dead of night we escaped out of our window by a knotted rope\nwhich he had made ready, and beneath was the city wall; and that\ncompany of knights, amongst whom was the young knight abovesaid, had\ntaken a postern thereby, and were abiding us armed and with good\nhorses.  So we came into the open country, and rode our ways with the\nmind to reach a hill-castle of one of those young barons, and to hold\nourselves there in despite of the king.  But the king had been as wary\nas we were privy, and no less speedy than we; and he was a mighty and\ndeft warrior, and he himself followed us on the spur with certain of\nhis best men-at-arms. And they came upon us as we rested in a woodside\nnot far from our house of refuge: and the king stood by to see the\nbattle with his sword in his sheath, but soon was it at an end, for\nthough our friends fought valiantly, they were everyone slain or hurt,\nand but few escaped with bare life; but that young man who loved me so\nsorely crept up to me grievously hurt, and I did not forbear to kiss\nhim once on the face, for I deemed I should soon die also, and his\nblood stained my sleeve and my wrist, but he died not as then, but\nlived to be a dear friend to me for long.\n\n\"So we, my lord and I, were led back to the city, and he was held in\nward and I was cast into prison with chains and hunger and stripes.\nAnd the king would have had me lie there till I perished, that I might\nbe forgotten utterly; but there were many of the king's knights who\nmurmured at this, and would not forget me; so the king being\nconstrained, had me brought forth to be judged by his bishops of\nsorcery for the beguiling of my lord.  Long was the tale to me then,\nbut I will not make it long for thee; as was like to be, I was brought\nin guilty of sorcery, and doomed to be burned in the Great Square in\nthree days time.\n\n\"Nay, my friend, thou hast no need to look so troubled; for thou seest\nthat I was not burned.  This is the selfsame body that was tied to the\nstake in the market place of the king's city many a year ago.\n\n\"For the friends of my lord, young men for the most part, and many who\nhad been fain to be my friends also, put on their armour, and took my\nlord out of the courteous prison wherein he was, and came to the Great\nSquare whenas I stood naked in my smock bound amid the faggots; and I\nsaw the sheriffs' men give back, and great noise and rumour rise up\naround me:  and then all about me was a clear space for a moment and I\nheard the tramp of the many horse-hoofs, and the space was full of\nweaponed men shouting, and crying out, 'Life for our Lord's Lady!'\nThen a minute, and I was loose and in my lord's arms, and they brought\nme a horse and I mounted, lest the worst should come and we might have\nto flee.  So I could see much of what went on; and I saw that all the\nunarmed folk and lookers-on were gone, but at our backs was a great\ncrowd of folk with staves and bows who cried out, 'Life for the Lady!'\nBut before us was naught but the sheriffs' sergeants and a company of\nknights and men-at-arms, about as many as we were, and the king in\nfront of them, fully armed, his face hidden by his helm, and a royal\nsurcoat over his hauberk beaten with his bearing, to wit, a silver\ntower on a blue sky bestarred with gold.\n\n\"And now I could see that despite the bills and bows behind us the king\nwas going to fall on with his folk; and to say sooth I feared but\nlittle and my heart rose high within me, and I wished I had a sword in\nmy hand to strike once for life and love.  But lo! just as the king was\nraising his sword, and his trumpet was lifting the brass to his lips,\ncame a sound of singing, and there was come the Bishop and the Abbot of\nSt. Peter's and his monks with him, and cross bearers and readers and\nothers of the religious: and the Bishop bore in his hand the Blessed\nHost (as now I know it was) under a golden canopy, and he stood between\nthe two companies and faced the king, while his folk sang loud and\nsweet about him.\n\n\"Then the spears went up and from the rest, and swords were sheathed,\nand there went forth three ancient knights from out of the king's host\nand came up to him and spake with him.  Then he gat him away unto his\nHigh House; and the three old knights came to our folk, and spake with\nthe chiefs; but not with my lord, and I heard not what they said.  But\nmy lord came to me in all loving-kindness and brought me into the house\nof one of the Lineage, and into a fair chamber there, and kissed me,\nand made much of me; and brought me fair raiment and did it on me with\nhis own hands, even as his wont was to be for my tire-maiden.\n\n\"Then in a little while came those chiefs of ours and said that truce\nhad been hanselled them for this time, but on these terms, that my lord\nand I and all those who had been in arms, and whosoever would, that\nfeared the king's wrath, should have leave to depart from his city so\nthat they went and abode no nearer than fifty miles thereof till they\nshould know his further pleasure.  Albeit that whosoever would go home\npeaceably might abide in the city still and need not fear the king's\nwrath if he stirred no further: but that in any case the Sorceress\nshould get her gone from those walls.\n\n\"So we rode out of the gates that very day before sunset; for it was\nnow midsummer again, and it was three hours before noon that I was to\nhave been burned; and we were a gallant company of men-at-arms and\nknights; yet did I be-think me of those who were slain on that other\nday when we were taken, and fain had I been that they were riding with\nus; but at least that fair young man was in our company, though still\nweak with his hurts: for the prison and the process had worn away\nwellnigh two months.  True it is that I rejoiced to see him, for I had\ndeemed him dead.\n\n\"Dear friend, I pray thy pardon if I weary thee with making so long a\ntale of my friends of the past days; but needs must I tell thee\nsomewhat of them, lest thou love that which is not.  Since truly it is\nmyself that I would have thee to love, and none other.\n\n\"Many folk gathered to us as we rode our ways to a town which was my\nlord's own, and where all men were his friends, so that we came there\nwith a great host and sat down there in no fear of what the king might\ndo against us.  There was I duly wedded to my lord by a Bishop of Holy\nChurch, and made his Lady and Queen; for even so he would have it.\n\n\"And now began the sore troubles of that land, which had been once so\npeaceful and happy; the tale whereof I may one day tell thee; or rather\nmany tales of what befell me therein; but not now; for the day weareth;\nand I still have certain things that I must needs tell thee.\n\n\"We waged war against each other, my lord and the king, and whiles one,\nand whiles the other overcame.  Either side belike deemed that one\nbattle or two would end the strife; but so it was not, but it endured\nyear after year, till fighting became the chief business of all in the\nland.\n\n\"As for me, I had many tribulations.  Thrice I fled from the stricken\nfield with my lord to hide in some stronghold of the mountains.  Once\nwas I taken of the foemen in the town where I abode when my lord was\naway from me, and a huge slaughter of innocent folk was made, and I was\ncast into prison and chains, after I had seen my son that I had borne\nto my lord slain before mine eyes.  At last we were driven clean out of\nthe Kingdom of the Tower, and abode a long while, some two years, in\nthe wilderness, living like outlaws and wolves' heads, and lifting the\nspoil for our livelihood.  Forsooth of all the years that I abode about\nthe Land of Tower those were the happiest.  For we robbed no poor folk\nand needy, but rewarded them rather, and drave the spoil from rich men\nand lords, and hard-hearted chapmen-folk: we ravished no maid of the\ntillers, we burned no cot, and taxed no husbandman's croft or acre, but\ndefended them from their tyrants.  Nevertheless we gat an ill name wide\nabout through the kingdoms and cities; and were devils and witches to\nthe boot of thieves and robbers in the mouths of these men; for when\nthe rich man is hurt his wail goeth heavens high, and none may say he\nheareth not.\n\n\"Now it was at this time that I first fell in with the Champions of the\nDry Tree; for they became our fellows and brothers in arms in the\nwildwood: for they had not as yet builded their stronghold of the\nScaur, whereas thou and I shall be in two days time.  Many a wild deed\ndid our folk in their company, and many that had been better undone.\nWhiles indeed they went on journeys wherein we were not partakers, as\nwhen they went to the North and harried the lands of the Abbot of\nHigham, and rode as far even as over the Downs to Bear Castle and\nfought a battle there with the Captain of Higham: whereas we went never\nout of the Wood Perilous to the northward; and lifted little save in\nthe lands of our own proper foemen, the friends of the king.\n\n\"Now I say not of the men of the Dry Tree that they were good and\npeaceable men, nor would mercy hold their hands every while that they\nwere hard bestead and thrust into a corner.  Yet I say now and once for\nall that their fierceness was and is but kindness and pity when set\nagainst the cruelty of the Burg of the Four Friths; men who have no\nfriend to love, no broken foe to forgive, and can scarce be kind even\nto themselves: though forsooth they be wise men and cautelous and well\nliving before the world, and wealthy and holy.\"\n\nShe stayed her speech a while, and her eyes glittered in her flushed\nface and she set her teeth; and she was as one beside herself till\nRalph kissed her feet, and caressed her, and she went on again.\n\n\"Dear friend, when thou knowest what these men are and have been thou\nwilt bless thy friend Roger for leading thee forth from the Burg by\nnight and cloud, whatever else may happen to thee.\n\n\"Well, we abode in the wildwood, friends and good fellows from the\nfirst; and that young man, though he loved me ever, was somewhat healed\nof the fever of love, and was my faithful friend, in such wise that\nneither I nor my lord had aught to find fault with in him.  Meanwhile\nwe began to grow strong, for many joined us therein who had fled from\ntheir tyrants of the good towns and the manors of the baronage, and at\nlast in the third year naught would please my lord but we must enter\ninto the Kingdom of the Tower, and raise his banner in the wealthy\nland, and the fair cities.\n\n\"Moreover, his father, the King of the Tower, died in his bed in these\ndays, and no word of love or peace had passed between them since that\nmorning when I was led out to be burned in the Great Square.\n\n\"So we came forth from the forest, we, and the Champions of the Dry\nTree; and made the tale a short one.  For the king, the mighty warrior\nand wise man, was dead: and his captains of war, some of them were\ndead, and some weary of strife; and those who had been eager in debate\nwere falling to ask themselves wherefore they had fought and what was\nto do that they should still be fighting; and lo! when it came to be\nlooked into, it was all a matter of the life and death of one woman, to\nwit me myself, and why should she not live, why should she not sit upon\nthe throne with the man who loved her?\n\n\"Therefore when at last we came out from the twilight of the woods into\nthe sunny fields of the Land of the Tower, there was no man to naysay\nus; nay, the gates of the strong places flew open before the wind of\nour banners, and the glittering of our spears drew the folk together\ntoward the places of rejoicing.  We entered the master City in triumph,\nwith the houses hung with green boughs and the maidens casting flowers\nbefore our feet, and I sat a crowned Queen upon the throne high raised\non the very place where erst I stood awaiting the coming of the torch\nto the faggots which were to consume me.\n\n\"There then began the reign of the Woman of the Waste; for so it was,\nthat my lord left to my hands the real ruling of the kingdom, though he\nwore the crown and set the seal to parchments.  As to them of the Dry\nTree, though some few of them abode in the kingdom, and became great\nthere, the more part of them went back to the wildwood and lived the\nold life of the Wood, as we had found them living it aforetime.  But or\never they went, the leaders of them came before me, and kissed my feet,\nand with tears and prayers besought me, and bade me that if aught fell\namiss to me there, I should come back to them and be their Lady and\nQueen; and whereas these wild men loved me well, and I deemed that I\nowed much to their love and their helping, I promised them and swore to\nthem by the Water of the Well at the World's End that I would do no\nless than they prayed me: albeit I set no term or year for the day that\nI would come to them.\n\n\"And now my lord and I, we set ourselves to heal the wounds which war\nhad made in the land:  and hard was the work, and late the harvest; so\nused had men become to turmoil and trouble.  Moreover, there were many,\nand chiefly the women who had lost husband, lover, son or brother, who\nlaid all their griefs on my back; though forsooth how was I guilty of\nthe old king's wrath against me, which was the cause of all?  About\nthis time my lord had the Castle of Abundance built up very fairly for\nme and him to dwell in at whiles; and indeed we had before that dwelt\nat a little manor house that was there, when we durst withdraw a little\nfrom the strife; but now he had it done as fair as ye saw it, and had\nthose arras cloths made with the story of my sojourn in the wilderness,\neven as ye saw them.  But the days and the years wore, and wealth came\nback to the mighty of the land, and fields flourished and the acres\nbore increase, and fair houses were builded in the towns; and the land\nwas called happy again.\n\n\"But for me I was not so happy:  and I looked back fondly to the days\nof the greenwood and the fellowship of the Dry Tree, and the days\nbefore that, of my flight with my lord.  And moreover with the wearing\nof the years those murmurs against me and the blind causeless hatred\nbegan to grow again, and chiefly methinks because I was the king, and\nmy lord the king's cloak: but therewith tales concerning me began to\nspring up, how that I was not only a sorceress, but even one foredoomed\nfrom of old and sent by the lords of hell to wreck that fair Land of\nthe Tower and make it unhappy and desolate.  And the tale grew and\ngathered form, till now, when the bloom of my beauty was gone, I heard\nhard and fierce words cried after me in the streets when I fared\nabroad, and that still chiefly by the women:  for yet most men looked\non me with pleasure.  Also my counsellors and lords warned me often\nthat I must be wary and of great forbearance if trouble were to be kept\nback.\n\n\"Now amidst these things as I was walking pensively in my garden one\nsummer day, it was told me that a woman desired to see me, so I bade\nthem bring her.  And when she came I looked on her, and deemed that I\nhad seen her aforetime:  she was not old, but of middle age, of dark\nred hair, and brown eyes somewhat small: not a big woman, but well\nfashioned of body, and looking as if she had once been exceeding dainty\nand trim.  She spake, and again I seemed to have heard her voice\nbefore:  'Hail, Queen,' she said, 'it does my heart good to see thee\nthus in thy glorious estate.' So I took her greeting; but those tales\nof my being but a sending of the Devil for the ruin of that land came\ninto my mind, and I sent away the folk who were thereby before I said\nmore to her.  Then she spake again:  'Even so I guessed it would be\nthat thou wouldst grow great amongst women.'\n\n\"But I said, 'What is this? and when have I known thee before-time?'\nShe smiled and said naught; and my mind went back to those old days,\nand I trembled, and the flesh crept upon my bones, lest this should be\nthe coming back in a new shape of my mistress whom I had slain.  But\nthe woman laughed, and said, as if she knew my thoughts: 'Nay, it is\nnot so:  the dead are dead; fear not:  but hast thou forgotten the Dale\nof Lore?'\n\n\"'Nay,' said I, 'never; and art thou then the carline that learned me\nlore?  But if the dead come not back, how do the old grow young again?\nfor 'tis a score of years since we two sat in the Dale, and I longed\nfor many things.'\n\n\"Said the woman:  'The dead may not drink of the Well at the World's\nEnd; yet the living may, even if they be old; and that blessed water\ngiveth them new might and changeth their blood, and they are as young\nfolk for a long while again after they have drunken.' 'And hast thou\ndrunken?' said I.\n\n\"'Yea,' she said; 'but I am minded for another draught.'  I said: 'And\nwherefore hast thou come to me, and what shall I give to thee?' She\nsaid, 'I will take no gift of thee as now, for I need it not, though\nhereafter I may ask a gift of thee.  But I am to ask this of thee, if\nthou wilt be my fellow-farer on the road thither?' 'Yea?' said I, 'and\nleave my love and my lord, and my kingship which he hath given me? for\nthis I will tell thee, that all that here is done, is done by me.'\n\n\"'Great is thy Kingship, Lady,' said the woman, and smiled withal.\nThen she sat silent a little, and said:  'When six months are worn, it\nwill be springtide; I will come to thee in the spring days, and know\nwhat thy mind is then.  But now I must depart.' Quoth I:  'Glad shall I\nbe to talk with thee again; for though thou hast learned me much of\nwisdom, yet much more I need; yea, as much as the folk here deem I have\nalready.' 'Thou shalt have no less,' said the woman.  Then she kissed\nmy hands and went her ways, and I sat musing still for a long while:\nbecause for all my gains, and my love that I had been loved withal, and\nthe greatness that I had gotten, there was as it were a veil of\nunhappiness wrapped round about my heart.\n\n\"So wore the months, and ere the winter had come befell an evil thing,\nfor my lord, who had loved me so, and taken me out of the wilderness,\ndied, and was gathered to the fathers, and there was I left alone; for\nthere was no fruit of my womb by him alive.  My first-born had been\nslain by those wretches, and a second son that I bore had died of a\npestilence that war and famine had brought upon the land.  I will not\nwear thy soul with words about my grief and sorrow: but it is to be\ntold that I sat now in a perilous place, and yet I might not step down\nfrom it and abide in that land, for then it was a sure thing, that some\nof my foes would have laid hand on me and brought me to judgment for\nbeing but myself, and I should have ended miserably.  So I gat to me\nall the strength that I might, and whereas there were many who loved me\nstill, some for my own sake, and some for the sake of my lord that was,\nI endured in good hope that all my days were not done.  Yet I longed\nfor the coming of the Teacher of Lore; for now I made up my mind that I\nwould go with her, and seek to the Well at the World's End for weal and\nwoe.\n\n\"She came while April was yet young:  and I need make no long tale of\nhow we gat us away:  for whereas she was wise in hidden lore, it was no\nhard matter for her to give me another semblance than mine own, so that\nI might have walked about the streets of our city from end to end, and\nnone had known me.  So I vanished away from my throne and my kingdom,\nand that name and fame of a witch-wife clove to me once and for all,\nand spread wide about the cities of folk and the kingdoms, and many are\nthe tales that have arisen concerning me, and belike some of these thou\nhast heard told.\"\n\nRalph reddened and said:  \"My soul has been vexed by some inkling of\nthem; but now it is at rest from them for ever.\"\n\n\"May it be so!\" she said:  \"and now my tale is wearing thin for the\npresent time.\n\n\"Back again went my feet over the ways they had trodden before, though\nthe Teacher shortened the road much for us by her wisdom.  Once again\nwhat need to tell thee of these ways when thine own eyes shall behold\nthem as thou wendest them beside me?  Be it enough to say that once\nagain I came to that little house in the uttermost wilderness, and\nthere once more was the garth and the goat-house, and the trees of the\nforest beyond it, and the wood-lawns and the streams and all the places\nand things that erst I deemed I must dwell amongst for ever.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"And did the carline keep troth with thee?  Was she not\nbut luring thee thither to be her thrall?  Or did the book that I read\nin the Castle of Abundance but lie concerning thee?\"\n\n\"She held her troth to me in all wise,\" said the Lady, \"and I was no\nthrall of hers, but as a sister, or it may be even as a daughter; for\never to my eyes was she the old carline who learned me lore in the Dale\nof the wildwood.\n\n\"But now a long while, years long, we abode in that House of the\nSorceress ere we durst seek further to the Well at the World's End.\nAnd yet meseems though the years wore, they wore me no older; nay, in\nthe first days at least I waxed stronger of body and fairer than I had\nbeen in the King's Palace in the Land of the Tower, as though some\nforetaste of the Well was there for us in the loneliness of the desert;\nalthough forsooth the abiding there amidst the scantiness of\nlivelihood, and the nakedness, and the toil, and the torment of wind\nand weather were as a penance for the days and deeds of our past lives.\nWhat more is to say concerning our lives here, saving this, that in\nthose days I learned yet more wisdom of the Teacher of Lore, and amidst\nthat wisdom was much of that which ye call sorcery: as the foreseeing\nof things to come, and the sending of dreams or visions, and certain\nother matters.  And I may tell thee that the holy man who came to us\nlast even, I sent him the dream which came to him drowsing, and bade\nhim come to the helping of Walter the Black:  for I knew that I should\ntake thy hand and flee with thee this morning e'en as I have done: and\nI would fain have a good leech to Walter lest he should die, although I\nowe him hatred rather than love.  Now, my friend, tell me, is this an\nevil deed, and dost thou shrink from the Sorceress?\"\n\nHe strained her to his bosom and kissed her mouth, and then he said:\n\"Yet thou hast never sent a dream to me.\" She laughed and said:  \"What!\nhast thou never dreamed of me since we met at the want-way of the Wood\nPerilous?\" \"Never,\" said he.  She stroked his cheek fondly, and said:\n\"Young art thou, sweet friend, and sleepest well a-nights. It was\nenough that thou thoughtest of me in thy waking hours.\" Then she went\non with her tale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nThe Lady Maketh an End of Her Tale\n\n\n\"Well, my friend, after we had lived thus a long time, we set out one\nday to seek to the Well at the World's End, each of us signed and\nmarked out for the quest by bearing such-like beads as thou and I both\nbear upon our necks today.  Once again of all that befell us on that\nquest I will tell thee naught as now:  because to that Well have I to\nbring thee: though myself, belike, I need not its waters again.\"\n\nQuoth Ralph:  \"And must thou lead me thy very self, mayest thou not\nabide in some safe place my going and returning?  So many and sore as\nthe toils and perils of the way may be.\" \"What!\" she said, \"and how\nshall I be sundered from thee now I have found thee?  Yea, and who\nshall lead thee, thou lovely boy?  Shall it be a man to bewray thee, or\na woman to bewray me?  Yet need we not go tomorrow, my beloved, nor for\nmany days: so sweet as we are to each other.\n\n\"But in those past days it was needs must we begin our quest before the\nburden of years was over heavy upon us.  Shortly to say it, we found\nthe Well, and drank of its waters after abundant toil and peril, as\nthou mayst well deem.  Then the life and the soul came back to us, and\nthe past years were as naught to us, and my youth was renewed in me,\nand I became as thou seest me to-day. But my fellow was as a woman of\nforty summers again, strong and fair as I had seen her when she came\ninto the garden in the days of my Queenhood, and thus we returned to\nthe House of the Sorceress, and rested there for a little from our\ntravel and our joy.\n\n\"At last, and that was but some five years ago, the Teacher said to me:\n'Sister, I have learned thee all that thine heart can take of me, and\nthou art strong in wisdom, and moreover again shall it be with thee, as\nI told of thee long ago, that no man shall look on thee that shall not\nlove thee.  Now I will not seek to see thy life that is coming, nor\nwhat thine end shall be, for that should belike be grievous to both of\nus; but this I see of thee, that thou wilt now guide thy life not as I\nwill, but as thou wilt; and since my way is not thy way, and that I see\nthou shalt not long abide alone, now shall we sunder; for I am minded\nto go to the most ancient parts of the world, and seek all the\ninnermost of wisdom whiles I yet live; but with kings and champions and\nthe cities of folk will I have no more to do: while thou shalt not be\nable to refrain from these.  So now I bid thee farewell.'\n\n\"I wept at her words, but gainsaid them naught, for I wotted that she\nspake but the truth; so I kissed her, and we parted; she went her ways\nthrough the wildwood, and I abode at the House of the Sorceress, and\nwaited on the wearing of the days.\n\n\"But scarce a month after her departure, as I stood by the threshold\none morning amidst of the goats, I saw men come riding from out the\nwood; so I abode them, and they came to the gate of the garth and there\nlighted down from their horses, and they were three in company; and no\none of them was young, and one was old, with white locks flowing down\nfrom under his helm: for they were all armed in knightly fashion, but\nthey had naught but white gaberdines over their hauberks, with no\ncoat-armour or token upon them.  So they came through the garth-gate\nand I greeted them and asked them what they would; then the old man\nknelt down on the grass before me and said: 'If I were as young as I am\nold my heart would fail me in beholding thy beauty:  but now I will ask\nthee somewhat:  far away beyond the forest we heard rumours of a woman\ndwelling in the uttermost desert, who had drunk of the Well at the\nWorld's End, and was wise beyond measure.  Now we have set ourselves to\nseek that woman, and if thou be she, we would ask a question of thy\nwisdom.'\n\n\"I answered that I was even such as they had heard of, and bade them\nask.\n\n\"Said the old man:\n\n\"'Fifty years ago, when I was yet but a young man, there was a fair\nwoman who was Queen of the Land of the Tower and whom we loved sorely\nbecause we had dwelt together with her amidst tribulation in the desert\nand the wildwood:  and we are not of her people, but a fellowship of\nfree men and champions hight the Men of the Dry Tree:  and we hoped\nthat she would one day come back and dwell with us and be our Lady and\nQueen: and indeed trouble seemed drawing anigh her, so that we might\nhelp her and she might become our fellow again, when lo! she vanished\naway from the folk and none knew where she was gone.  Therefore a band\nof us of the Dry Tree swore an oath together to seek her till we found\nher, that we might live and die together: but of that band of one score\nand one, am I the last one left that seeketh; for the rest are dead, or\nsick, or departed: and indeed I was the youngest of them.  But for\nthese two men, they are my sons whom I have bred in the knowledge of\nthese things and in the hope of finding tidings of our Lady and Queen,\nif it were but the place where her body lieth.  Thou art wise: knowest\nthou the resting place of her bones?\"\n\n\"When I had heard the tale of the old man I was moved to my inmost\nheart, and I scarce knew what to say.  But now this long while fear was\ndead in me, so I thought I would tell the very sooth: but I said first:\n'Sir, what I will tell, I will tell without beseeching, so I pray thee\nstand up.'  So did he, and I said: 'Geoffrey, what became of the white\nhind after the banners had left the wildwood'? He stared wild at me,\nand I deemed that tears began to come into his eyes; but I said again:\n'What betid to dame Joyce's youngest born, the fair little maiden that\nwe left sick of a fever when we rode to Up-castle?' Still he said\nnaught but looked at me wondering:  and said: 'Hast thou ever again\nseen that great old oak nigh the clearing by the water, the half of\nwhich fell away in the summer-storm of that last July?'\n\n\"Then verily the tears gushed out of his eyes, and he wept, for as old\nas he was; and when he could master himself he said:  'Who art thou?\nWho art thou?  Art thou the daughter of my Lady, even as these are my\nsons?' But I said:  'Now will I answer thy first question, and tell\nthee that the Lady thou seekest is verily alive; and she has thriven,\nfor she has drunk of the Well at the World's End, and has put from her\nthe burden of the years.  O Geoffrey, and dost thou not know me?'  And\nI held out my hand to him, and I also was weeping, because of my\nthought of the years gone by; for this old man had been that swain who\nhad nigh died for me when I fled with my husband from the old king; and\nhe became one of the Dry Tree, and had followed me with kind service\nabout the woods in the days when I was at my happiest.\n\n\"But now he fell on his knees before me not like a vassal but like a\nlover, and kissed my feet, and was beside himself for joy.  And his\nsons, who were men of some forty summers, tall and warrior-like, kissed\nmy hands and made obeisance before me.\n\n\"Now when we had come to ourselves again, old Geoffrey, who was now\nnaught but glad, spake and said:  'It is told amongst us that when our\nhost departed from the Land of the Tower, after thou hadst taken thy\ndue seat upon the throne, that thou didst promise our chieftains how\nthou wouldst one day come back to the fellowship of the Dry Tree and\ndwell amongst us.  Wilt thou now hold to thy promise?'  I said:  'O\nGeoffrey, if thou art the last of those seekers, and thou wert but a\nboy when I dwelt with you of old, who of the Dry Tree is left to\nremember me?'  He hung his head awhile then, and spake: 'Old are we\ngrown, yet art thou fittest to be amongst young folk: unless mine eyes\nare beguiled by some semblance which will pass away presently.'  'Nay,'\nquoth I, 'it is not so; as I am now, so shall I be for many and many a\nday.' 'Well,' said Geoffrey, 'wherever thou mayst be, thou shalt be\nQueen of men.'\n\n\"'I list not to be Queen again,' said I. He laughed and said: 'I wot\nnot how thou mayst help it.'\n\n\"I said:  'Tell me of the Dry Tree, how the champions have sped, and\nhave they grown greater or less.'  Said he: 'They are warriors and\nchampions from father to son; therefore have they thriven not over\nwell; yet they have left the thick of the wood, and built them a great\ncastle above the little town hight Hampton; so that is now called\nHampton under Scaur, for upon the height of the said Scaur is our\ncastle builded: and there we hold us against the Burg of the Four\nFriths which hath thriven greatly; there is none so great as the Burg\nin all the lands about.'\n\n\"I said:  'And the Land of the Tower, thriveth the folk thereof at\nall?' 'Nay,' he said, 'they have been rent to pieces by folly and war\nand greediness:  in the Great City are but few people, grass grows in\nits streets; the merchants wend not the ways that lead thither.  Naught\nthriveth there since thou stolest thyself away from them.'\n\n\"'Nay,' I said, 'I fled from their malice, lest I should have been\nbrought out to be burned once more; and there would have been none to\nrescue then.' 'Was it so?' said old Geoffrey; 'well it is all one now;\ntheir day is done.'\n\n\"'Well,' I said, 'come into my house, and eat and drink therein and\nsleep here to-night, and to-morrow I shall tell thee what I will do.'\n\n\"Even so they did; and on the morrow early I spake to Geoffrey and\nsaid: 'What hath befallen the Land of Abundance, and the castle my lord\nbuilt for me there; which we held as our refuge all through the War of\nthe Tower, both before we joined us to you in the wildwood, and\nafterwards?'  He said: 'It is at peace still; no one hath laid hand on\nit; there is a simple folk dwelling there in the clearing of the wood,\nwhich forgetteth thee not; though forsooth strange tales are told of\nthee there; and the old men deem that it is but a little since thou\nhast ceased to come and go there; and they are ready to worship thee as\nsomewhat more than the Blessed Saints, were it not for the Fathers of\nthe Thorn who are their masters.'\n\n\"I pondered this a while, and then said:  'Geoffrey, ye shall bring me\nhence away to the peopled parts, and on the way, or when we are come\namongst the cities and the kingdoms, we will settle it whither I shall\ngo.  See thou!  I were fain to be of the brotherhood of the Dry Tree;\nyet I deem it will scarce be that I shall go and dwell there\nstraightway.'\n\n\"Therewith the old man seemed content; and indeed now that the first\njoy of our meeting, when his youth sprang up in him once more, was\nover, he found it hard to talk freely with me, and was downcast and shy\nbefore me, as if something had come betwixt us, which had made our\nlives cold to each other.\n\n\"So that day we left the House of the Sorceress, which I shall not see\nagain, till I come there hand in hand with thee, beloved.  When we came\nto the peopled parts, Geoffrey and his sons brought me to the Land of\nAbundance, and I found it all as he had said to me: and I took up my\ndwelling in the castle, and despised not those few folk of the land,\nbut was kind to them:  but though they praised my gifts, and honoured\nme as the saints are honoured, and though they loved me, yet it was\nwith fear, so that I had little part with them.  There I dwelt then;\nand the book which thou didst read there, part true and part false, and\naltogether of malice against me, I bought of a monk who came our way,\nand who at first was sore afeared when he found that he had come to my\ncastle.  As to the halling of the Chamber of Dais, I have told thee\nbefore how my lord, the King's Son, did do make it in memory of the\nwilderness wherein he found me, and the life of thralldom from which he\nbrought me.  There I dwelt till nigh upon these days in peace and\nquiet: not did I go to the Dry Tree for a long while, though many of\nthem sought to me there at the Castle of Abundance; and, woe worth the\nwhile!  there was oftenest but one end to their guesting, that of all\ngifts, they besought me but of one, which, alack!  I might not give\nthem: and that is the love that I have given to thee, beloved.--And,\noh! my fear, that it will weigh too light with thee, to win me pardon\nof thee for all that thou must needs pardon me, ere thou canst give me\nall thy love, that I long for so sorely.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nThey Go On Their Way Once More\n\n\n\"Look now,\" she said, \"I have held thee so long in talk, that the\nafternoon is waning; now is it time for us to be on the way again; not\nbecause I misdoubt me of thy foeman, but because I would take thee to a\nfairer dwelling of the desert, and one where I have erst abided; and\nmoreover, there thou shalt not altogether die of hunger.  See, is it\nnot as if I had thought to meet thee here?\"\n\n\"Yea, in good sooth,\" said he, \"I wot that thou canst see the story of\nthings before they fall.\"\n\nShe laughed and said:  \"But all this that hath befallen since I set out\nto meet thee at the Castle of Abundance I foresaw not, any more than I\ncan foresee to-morrow. Only I knew that we must needs pass by the place\nwhereto I shall now lead thee, and I made provision there.  Lo! now the\nmarvel slain: and in such wise shall perish other marvels which have\nbeen told of me; yet not all.  Come now, let us to the way.\"\n\nSo they joined hands and left the pleasant place, and were again going\nspeedily amidst the close pine woods awhile, where it was smooth\nunderfoot and silent of noises withal.\n\nNow Ralph said:  \"Beloved, thou hast told me of many things, but naught\nconcerning how thou camest to be wedded to the Knight of the Sun, and\nof thy dealings with him.\"\n\nSaid she, reddening withal:  \"I will tell thee no more than this,\nunless thou compel me:  that he would have me wed him, as it were\nagainst my will, till I ceased striving against him, and I went with\nhim to Sunway, which is no great way from the Castle of Abundance, and\nthere befell that treason of Walter the Black, who loved me and prayed\nfor my love, and when I gainsaid him, swore by all that was holy,\nbefore my lord, that it was I who sought his love, and how I had told\nand taught him ways of witchcraft, whereby we might fulfill our love,\nso that the Baron should keep a wife for another man.  And the Knight\nof the Sun, whose heart had been filled with many tales of my wisdom,\ntrue and false, believed his friend whom he loved, and still believeth\nhim, though he burneth for the love of me now; whereas in those first\ndays of the treason, he burned with love turned to hatred.  So of this\ncame that shaming and casting-forth of me.  Whereof I will tell thee\nbut this, that the brother of my lord, even the tall champion whom thou\nhast seen, came upon me presently, when I was cast forth; because he\nwas coming to see the Knight of the Sun at his home; and he loved me,\nbut not after the fashion of his brother, but was kind and mild with\nme.  So then I went with him to Hampton and the Dry Tree, and great joy\nmade the folk thereof of my coming, whereas they remembered their\nasking of aforetime that I would come to be a Queen over them, and\nthere have I dwelt ever since betwixt Hampton and the Castle of\nAbundance; and that tall champion has been ever as a brother unto me.\"\n\nSaid Ralph, \"And thou art their Queen there?\"  \"Yea,\" she said, \"in a\nfashion; yet have they another who is mightier than I, and might, if\nshe durst, hang me over the battlements of the Scaur, for she is a\nfierce and hard woman, and now no longer young in years.\"\n\n\"Is it not so then,\" said Ralph, \"that some of the ill deeds that are\ntold of thee are of her doing?\"\n\n\"It is even so,\" she said, \"and whiles when she has spoken the word I\nmay not be against her openly, therefore I use my wisdom which I have\nlearned, to set free luckless wights from her anger and malice.  More\nby token the last time I did thus was the very night of the day we\nparted, after thou hadst escaped from the Burg.\"\n\n\"In what wise was that?\" said Ralph.  She said:  \"When I rode away from\nthee on that happy day of my deliverance by thee, my heart laughed for\njoy of the life thou hadst given me, and of thee the giver, and I swore\nto myself that I would set free the first captive or death-doomed\ncreature that I came across, in honour of my pleasure and delight: now\nspeedily I came to Hampton and the Scaur; for it is not very far from\nthe want-ways of the wood: and there I heard how four of our folk had\nbeen led away by the men of the Burg, therefore it was clear to me that\nI must set these men free if I could; besides, it pleased me to think\nthat I could walk about the streets of the foemen safely, who had been\nbut just led thitherward to the slaughter.  Thou knowest how I sped\ntherein.  But when I came back again to our people, after thou hadst\nridden away from us with Roger, I heard these tidings, that there was\none new-come into our prison, a woman to wit, who had been haled before\nour old Queen for a spy and doomed by her, and should be taken forth\nand slain, belike, in a day or two.  So I said to myself that I was not\nfree of my vow as yet, because those friends of mine, I should in any\ncase have done my best to deliver them: therefore I deemed my oath\nbound me to set that woman free.  So in the night-tide when all was\nquiet I went to the prison and brought her forth, and led her past all\nthe gates and wards, which was an easy thing to me, so much as I had\nlearned, and came with her into the fields betwixt the thorp of Hampton\nand the wood, when it was more daylight than dawn, so that I could see\nher clearly, and no word as yet had we spoken to each other.  But then\nshe said to me: 'Am I to be slain here or led to a crueller prison?'\nAnd I said: 'Neither one thing nor the other:  for lo!  I have set thee\nfree, and I shall look to it that there shall be no pursuit of thee\ntill thou hast had time to get clear away.'  But she said: 'What thanks\nwilt thou have for this?  Wherefore hast thou done it?' And I said, 'It\nis because of the gladness I have gotten.' Said she, 'And would that I\nmight get gladness!' So I asked her what was amiss now that she was\nfree.  She said: 'I have lost one thing that I loved, and found another\nand lost it also.'  So I said:  'Mightest thou not seek for the lost?'\nShe said, 'It is in this wood, but when I shall find it I shall not\nhave it.'  'It is love that thou art seeking,' said I. 'In what\nsemblance is he?'\n\n\"What wilt thou, my friend?  Straightway she fell to making a picture\nof thee in words; so that I knew that she had met thee, and belike\nafter I had departed from thee, and my heart was sore thereat; for now\nI will tell thee the very truth, that she was a young woman and\nexceeding fair, as if she were of pearl all over, and as sweet as\neglantine; and I feared her lest she should meet thee again in these\nwildwoods.  And so I asked her what would she, and she said that she\nhad a mind to seek to the Well at the World's End, which quencheth all\nsorrow; and I rejoiced thereat, thinking that she would be far away\nfrom thee, not thinking that thou and I must even meet to seek to it\nalso.  So I gave her the chaplet which my witch-mistress took from the\ndead woman's neck; and went with her into the wildwood, and taught her\nwisdom of the way and what she was to do.  And again I say to thee that\nshe was so sweet and yet with a kind of pity in her both of soul and\nbody, and wise withal and quiet, that I feared her, though I loved her;\nyea and still do: for I deem her better than me, and meeter for thee\nand thy love than I be.--Dost thou know her?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and fair and lovely she is in sooth.  Yet hast thou\nnaught to do to fear her.  And true it is that I saw her and spake with\nher after thou hadst ridden away.  For she came by the want-ways of the\nWood Perilous in the dawn of the day after I had delivered thee; and in\nsooth she told me that she looked either for Death, or the Water of the\nWell to end her sorrow.\"\n\nThen he smiled and said; \"As for that which thou sayest, that she had\nbeen meeter for me than thou, I know not this word.  For look you,\nbeloved, she came, and passed, and is gone, but thou art there and\nshalt endure.\"\n\nShe stayed, and turned and faced him at that word; and love so consumed\nher, that all sportive words failed her; yea and it was as if mirth and\nlight-heartedness were swallowed up in the fire of her love; and all\nthought of other folk departed from him as he felt her tears of love\nand joy upon his face, and she kissed and embraced him there in the\nwilderness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nOf the Desert-House and the Chamber of Love in the Wilderness\n\n\nThen in a while they grew sober and went on their ways, and the sun was\nwestering behind them, and casting long shadows.  And in a little while\nthey were come out of the thick woods and were in a country of steep\nlittle valleys, grassy, besprinkled with trees and bushes, with hills\nof sandstone going up from them, which were often broken into cliffs\nrising sheer from the tree-beset bottoms:  and they saw plenteous deer\nboth great and small, and the wild things seemed to fear them but\nlittle.  To Ralph it seemed an exceeding fair land, and he was as\njoyous as it was fair; but the Lady was pensive, and at last she said:\n\"Thou deemest it fair, and so it is; yet is it the lonesomest of\ndeserts.  I deem indeed that it was once one of the fairest of lands,\nwith castles and cots and homesteads all about, and fair people no few,\nbusy with many matters amongst them.  But now it is all passed away,\nand there is no token of a dwelling of man, save it might be that those\nmounds we see, as yonder, and yonder again, are tofts of house-walls\nlong ago sunken into the earth of the valley.  And now few even are the\nhunters or way-farers that wend through it.\"\n\nQuoth Ralph:  \"Thou speakest as if there had been once histories and\ntales of this pleasant wilderness:  tell me, has it anything to do with\nthat land about the wide river which we went through, Roger and I, as\nwe rode to the Castle of Abundance the other day?  For he spoke of\ntales of deeds and mishaps concerning it.\" \"Yea,\" she said, \"so it is,\nand the little stream that runs yonder beneath those cliffs, is making\nits way towards that big river aforesaid, which is called the Swelling\nFlood.  Now true it is also that there are many tales about of the wars\nand miseries that turned this land into a desert, and these may be true\nenough, and belike are true.  But these said tales have become blended\nwith the story of those aforesaid wars of the Land of the Tower; of\nwhich indeed this desert is verily a part, but was desert still in the\ndays when I was Queen of the Land; so thou mayst well think that they\nwho hold me to be the cause of all this loneliness (and belike Roger\nthought it was so) have scarce got hold of the very sooth of the\nmatter.\"\n\n\"Even so I deemed,\" said Ralph:  \"and to-morrow we shall cross the big\nriver, thou and I. Is there a ferry or a ford there whereas we shall\ncome, or how shall we win over it?\"\n\nShe was growing merrier again now, and laughed at this and said: \"O\nfair boy! the crossing will be to-morrow and not to-day; let to-morrow\ncross its own rivers; for surely to-day is fair enough, and fairer\nshall it be when thou hast been fed and art sitting by me in rest and\npeace till to-morrow morning.  So now hasten yet a little more; and we\nwill keep the said little stream in sight as well as we may for the\nbushes.\"\n\nSo they sped on, till Ralph said:  \"Will thy feet never tire, beloved?\"\n\"O child,\" she said, \"thou hast heard my story, and mayst well deem\nthat they have wrought many a harder day's work than this day's. And\nmoreover they shall soon rest; for look! yonder is our house for this\neven, and till to-morrow's sun is high: the house for me and thee and\nnone else with us.\"  And therewith she pointed to a place where the\nstream ran in a chain of pools and stickles, and a sheer cliff rose up\nsome fifty paces beyond it, but betwixt the stream and the cliff was a\nsmooth table of greensward, with three fair thorn bushes thereon, and\nit went down at each end to the level of the river's lip by a green\nslope, but amidmost, the little green plain was some ten feet above the\nstream, and was broken by a little undercliff, which went down sheer\ninto the water.  And Ralph saw in the face of the high cliff the mouth\nof a cave, however deep it might be.\n\n\"Come,\" said the Lady, \"tarry not, for I know that hunger hath hold of\nthee, and look, how low the sun is growing!\" Then she caught him by the\nhand, and fell to running with him to the edge of the stream, where at\nthe end of the further slope it ran wide and shallow before it entered\ninto a deep pool overhung with boughs of alder and thorn.  She stepped\ndaintily over a row of big stones laid in the rippling shallow; and\nstaying herself in mid-stream on the biggest of them, and gathering up\nher gown, looked up stream with a happy face, and then looked over her\nshoulder to Ralph and said: \"The year has been good to me these\nseasons, so that when I stayed here on my way to the Castle of\nAbundance, I found but few stones washed away, and crossed wellnigh\ndry-shod, but this stone my feet are standing on now, I brought down\nfrom under the cliff, and set it amid-most, and I said that when I\nbrought thee hither I would stay thereon and talk with thee while I\nstood above the freshness of the water, as I am doing now.\"\n\nRalph looked on her and strove to answer her, but no words would come\nto his lips, because of the greatness of his longing; she looked on him\nfondly, and then stooped to look at the ripples that bubbled up about\nher shoes, and touched them at whiles; then she said: \"See how they\nlong for the water, these feet that have worn the waste so long, and\nknow how kind it will run over them and lap about them: but ye must\nabide a little, waste-wearers, till we have done a thing or two.  Come,\nlove!\"  And she reached her hand out behind her to Ralph, not looking\nback, but when she felt his hand touch it, she stepped lightly over the\nother stones, and on to the grass with him, and led him quietly up the\nslope that went up to the table of greensward before the cave.  But\nwhen they came on to the level grass she kissed him, and then turned\ntoward the valley and spake solemnly: \"May all blessings light on this\nHouse of the wilderness and this Hall of the Summer-tide, and the\nChamber of Love that here is!\"\n\nThen was she silent a while, and Ralph brake not the silence.  Then she\nturned to him with a face grown merry and smiling, and said: \"Lo! how\nthe poor lad yearneth for meat, as well he may, so long as the day hath\nbeen.  Ah, beloved, thou must be patient a little.  For belike our\nservants have not yet heard of the wedding of us.  So we twain must\nfeed each the other.  Is that so much amiss?\"\n\nHe laughed in her face for love, and took her by the wrist, but she\ndrew her hand away and went into the cave, and came forth anon holding\na copper kettle with an iron bow, and a bag of meal, which she laid at\nhis feet; then she went into the cave again, and brought forth a flask\nof wine and a beaker; then she caught up the little cauldron, which was\nwell-beaten, and thin and light, and ran down to the stream therewith,\nand came up thence presently, bearing it full of water on her head,\ngoing as straight and stately as the spear is seen on a day of tourney,\nmoving over the barriers that hide the knight, before he lays it in the\nrest.  She came up to him and set the water-kettle before him, and put\nher hands on his shoulders, and kissed his cheek, and then stepped back\nfrom him and smote her palms together, and said: \"Yea, it is well!  But\nthere are yet more things to do before we rest.  There is the dighting\nof the chamber, and the gathering of wood for the fire, and the mixing\nof the meal, and the kneading and the baking of cakes; and all that is\nmy work, and there is the bringing of the quarry for the roast, and\nthat is thine.\"\n\nThen she ran into the cave and brought forth a bow and a quiver of\narrows, and said:  \"Art thou somewhat of an archer?\" Quoth he:  \"I\nshoot not ill.\"  \"And I,\" she said, \"shoot well, all woodcraft comes\nhandy to me.  But this eve I must trust to thy skill for my supper.  Go\nswiftly and come back speedily.  Do off thine hauberk, and beat the\nbushes down in the valley, and bring me some small deer, as roe or hare\nor coney.  And wash thee in the pool below the stepping-stones, as I\nshall do whiles thou art away, and by then thou comest back, all shall\nbe ready, save the roasting of the venison.\"\n\nSo he did off his wargear, but thereafter tarried a little, looking at\nher, and she said:  \"What aileth thee not to go? the hunt's up.\"  He\nsaid: \"I would first go see the rock-hall that is for our chamber\nto-night; wilt thou not bring me in thither?\"  \"Nay,\" she said, \"for I\nmust be busy about many matters; but thou mayst go by thyself, if thou\nwilt.\"\n\nSo he went and stooped down and entered the cave, and found it high and\nwide within, and clean and fresh and well-smelling, and the floor of\nfine white sand without a stain.\n\nSo he knelt down and kissed the floor, and said aloud: \"God bless this\nfloor of the rock-hall whereon my love shall lie to-night!\" Then he\narose and went out of the cave, and found the Lady at the entry\nstooping down to see what he would do; and she looked on him fondly and\nanxiously; but he turned a merry face to her, and caught her round the\nmiddle and strained her to his bosom, and then took the bow and arrows\nand ran down the slope and over the stream, into the thicket of the\nvalley.\n\nHe went further than he had looked for, ere he found a prey to his\nmind, and then he smote a roe with a shaft and slew her, and broke up\nthe carcase and dight it duly, and so went his ways back.  When he came\nto the stream he looked up and saw a little fire glittering not far\nfrom the cave, but had no clear sight of the Lady, though he thought he\nsaw her gown fluttering nigh one of the thorn-bushes.  Then he did off\nhis raiment and entered that pool of the stream, and was glad to bathe\nhim in the same place where her body had been but of late; for he had\nnoted that the stones of the little shore were still wet with her feet\nwhere she had gone up from the water.\n\nBut now, as he swam and sported in the sun-warmed pool he deemed he\nheard the whinnying of a horse, but was not sure, so he held himself\nstill to listen, and heard no more.  Then he laughed and bethought him\nof Falcon his own steed, and dived down under the water; but as he came\nup, laughing still and gasping, he heard a noise of the clatter of\nhorse hoofs, as if some one were riding swiftly up the further side of\nthe grassy table, where it was stony, as he had noted when they passed\nby.\n\nA deadly fear fell upon his heart as he thought of his love left all\nalone; so he gat him at once out of the water and cast his shirt over\nhis head; but while his arms were yet entangled in the sleeves thereof,\ncame to his ears a great and awful sound of a man's voice roaring out,\nthough there were no shapen words in the roar.  Then were his arms free\nthrough the sleeves, and he took up the bow and fell to bending it, and\neven therewith he heard a great wailing of a woman's voice, and she\ncried out, piteously:  \"Help me, O help, lovely creature of God!\"\n\nYet must he needs finish bending the bow howsoever his heart died\nwithin him; or what help would there be of a naked and unarmed man?  At\nlast it was bent and an arrow nocked on the string, as he leapt over\nthe river and up the slope.\n\nBut even as he came up to that pleasant place he saw all in a moment of\ntime; that there stood Silverfax anigh the Cave's mouth, and the Lady\nlying on the earth anigh the horse; and betwixt her and him the Knight\nof the Sun stood up stark, his shining helm on his head, the last rays\nof the setting sun flashing in the broidered image of his armouries.\n\nHe turned at once upon Ralph, shaking his sword in the air (and there\nwas blood upon the blade) and he cried out in terrible voice:  \"The\nwitch is dead, the whore is dead!  And thou, thief, who hast stolen her\nfrom me, and lain by her in the wilderness, now shalt thou die, thou!\"\n\nScarce had he spoken than Ralph drew his bow to the arrow-head and\nloosed; there was but some twenty paces betwixt them, and the shaft,\nsped by that fell archer, smote the huge man through the eye into the\nbrain, and he fell down along clattering, dead without a word more.\n\nBut Ralph gave forth a great wail of woe, and ran forward and knelt by\nthe Lady, who lay all huddled up face down upon the grass, and he\nlifted her up and laid her gently on her back.  The blood was flowing\nfast from a great wound in her breast, and he tore off a piece of his\nshirt to staunch it, but she without knowledge of him breathed forth\nher last breath ere he could touch the hurt, and he still knelt by her,\nstaring on her as if he knew not what was toward.\n\nShe had dight her what she could to welcome his return from the\nhunting, and had set a wreath of meadow-sweet on her red hair, and a\ngarland of eglantine about her girdlestead, and left her feet naked\nafter the pool of the stream, and had turned the bezels of her\nfinger-rings outward, for joy of that meeting.\n\nAfter a while he rose up with a most bitter cry, and ran down the green\nslope and over the water, and hither and thither amongst the bushes\nlike one mad, till he became so weary that he might scarce go or stand\nfor weariness.  Then he crept back again to that Chamber of Love, and\nsat down beside his new-won mate, calling to mind all the wasted words\nof the day gone by; for the summer night was come now, most fair and\nfragrant.  But he withheld the sobbing passion of his heart and put\nforth his hand, and touched her, and she was still, and his hand felt\nher flesh that it was cold as marble.  And he cried out aloud in the\nnight and the wilderness, where there was none to hear him, and arose\nand went away from her, passing by Silverfax who was standing nearby,\nstretching out his head, and whinnying at whiles.  And he sat on the\nedge of the green table, and there came into his mind despite himself\nthoughts of the pleasant fields of Upmeads, and his sports and\npleasures there, and the even-song of the High House, and the folk of\nhis fellowship and his love.  And therewith his breast arose and his\nface was wryed, and he wept loud and long, and as if he should never\nmake an end of it.  But so weary was he, that at last he lay back and\nfell asleep, and woke not till the sun was high in the heavens.  And so\nit was, that his slumber had been so heavy, that he knew not at first\nwhat had befallen; and one moment he felt glad, and the next as if he\nshould never be glad again, though why he wotted not.  Then he turned\nabout and saw Silverfax cropping the grass nearby, and the Lady lying\nthere like an image that could move no whit, though the world awoke\nabout her.  Then he remembered, yet scarce all, so that wild hopes\nswelled his heart, and he rose to his knees and turned to her, and\ncalled to mind that he should never see her alive again, and sobbing\nand wailing broke out from him, for he was young and strong, and sorrow\ndealt hardly with him.\n\nBut presently he arose to his feet and went hither and thither, and\ncame upon the quenched coals of the cooking-fire: she had baked cakes\nfor his eating, and he saw them lying thereby, and hunger constrained\nhim, so he took and ate of them while the tears ran down his face and\nmingled with the bread he ate.  And when he had eaten, he felt stronger\nand therefore was life more grievous to him, and when he thought what\nhe should do, still one thing seemed more irksome than the other.\n\nHe went down to the water to drink, and passed by the body of the\nKnight of the Sun, and wrath was fierce in his heart against him who\nhad overthrown his happiness.  But when he had drunk and washed hands\nand face he came back again, and hardened his heart to do what he must\nneeds do.  He took up the body of the Lady and with grief that may not\nbe told of, he drew it into the cave, and cut boughs of trees and laid\nthem over her face and all her body, and then took great stones from\nthe scree at that other end of the little plain, and heaped them upon\nher till she was utterly hidden by them.  Then he came out on to the\ngreen place and looked on the body of his foe, and said to himself that\nall must be decent and in order about the place whereas lay his love.\nAnd he came and stood over the body and said: \"I have naught to do to\nhate him now:  if he hated me, it was but for a little while, and he\nknew naught of me.  So let his bones be covered up from the wolf and\nthe kite.  Yet shall they not lie alongside of her.  I will raise a\ncairn above him here on this fair little plain which he spoilt of all\njoy.\" Therewith he fell to, and straightened his body, and laid his\nhuge limbs together and closed his eyes and folded his arms over his\nbreast; and then he piled the stones above him, and went on casting\nthem on the heap a long while after there was need thereof.\n\nRalph had taken his raiment from the stream-side and done them on\nbefore this, and now he did on helm and hauberk, and girt his sword to\nhis side.  Then as he was about leaving the sorrowful place, he looked\non Silverfax, who had not strayed from the little plain, and came up to\nhim and did off saddle and bridle, and laid them within the cave, and\nbade the beast go whither he would.  He yet lingered about the place,\nand looked all around him and found naught to help him, and could frame\nin his mind no intent of a deed then, nor any tale of a deed he should\ndo thereafter.  Yet belike in his mind were two thoughts, and though\nneither softened his grief save a little, he did not shrink from them\nas he did from all others; and these two were of his home at Upmeads,\nwhich was so familiar to him, and of the Well at the World's End, which\nwas but a word.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nRalph Cometh Out of the Wilderness\n\n\nLong he stood letting these thoughts run through his mind, but at last\nwhen it was now midmorning, he stirred and gat him slowly down the\ngreen slope, and for very pity of himself the tears brake out from him\nas he crossed the stream and came into the bushy valley.  There he\nstayed his feet a little, and said to himself:  \"And whither then am I\ngoing?\" He thought of the Castle of Abundance and the Champions of the\nDry Tree, of Higham, and the noble warriors who sat at the Lord Abbot's\nboard, and of Upmeads and his own folk:  but all seemed naught to him,\nand he thought:  \"And how can I go back and bear folk asking me\ncuriously of my wayfarings, and whether I will do this, that, or the\nother thing.\" Withal he thought of that fair damsel and her sweet mouth\nin the hostelry at Bourton Abbas, and groaned when he thought of love\nand its ending, and he said within himself:  \"and now she is a wanderer\nabout the earth as I am;\" and he thought of her quest, and the chaplet\nof dame Katherine, his gossip, which he yet bore on his neck, and he\ndeemed that he had naught to choose but to go forward and seek that he\nwas doomed to; and now it seemed to him that there was that one thing\nto do and no other.  And though this also seemed to him but weariness\nand grief, yet whereas he had ever lightly turned him to doing what\nwork lay ready to hand; so now he knew that he must first of all get\nhim out of that wilderness, that he might hear the talk of folk\nconcerning the Well at the World's End, which he doubted not to hear\nagain when he came into the parts inhabited.\n\nSo now, with his will or without it, his feet bore him on, and he\nfollowed up the stream which the Lady had said ran into the broad river\ncalled the Swelling Flood; \"for,\" thought he, \"when I come thereabout I\nshall presently find some castle or good town, and it is like that\neither I shall have some tidings of the folk thereof, or else they will\ncompel me to do something, and that will irk me less than doing deeds\nof mine own will.\"\n\nHe went his ways till he came to where the wood and the trees ended,\nand the hills were lower and longer, well grassed with short grass, a\ndown country fit for the feeding of sheep; and indeed some sheep he\nsaw, and a shepherd or two, but far off.  At last, after he had left\nthe stream awhile, because it seemed to him to turn and wind round over\nmuch to the northward, he came upon a road running athwart the down\ncountry, so that he deemed that it must lead one way down to the\nSwelling Flood; so he followed it up, and after a while began to fall\nin with folk; and first two Companions armed and bearing long swords\nover their shoulders: he stopped as they met, and stared at them in the\nface, but answered not their greeting; and they had no will to meddle\nwith him, seeing his inches and that he was well armed, and looked no\ncraven: so they went on.\n\nNext he came on two women who had with them an ass between two\npanniers, laden with country stuff; and they were sitting by the\nwayside, one old and the other young.  He made no stay for them, and\nthough he turned his face their way, took no heed of them more than if\nthey were trees; though the damsel, who was well-liking and somewhat\ngaily clad, stood up when she saw his face anigh, and drew her gown\nskirt about her and moved daintily, and sighed and looked after him as\nhe went on, for she longed for him.\n\nYet again came two men a-horseback, merchants clad goodly, with three\ncarles, their servants, riding behind them; and all these had weapons\nand gave little more heed to him than he to them.  But a little after\nthey were gone, he stopped and said within himself: \"Maybe I had better\nhave gone their way, and this road doubtless leadeth to some place of\nresort.\"\n\nBut even therewith he heard horsehoofs behind him, and anon came up a\nman a-horseback, armed with jack and sallet, a long spear in his hand,\nand budgets at his saddle-bow, who looked like some lord's man going a\nmessage.  He nodded to Ralph, who gave him good-day; for seeing these\nfolk and their ways had by now somewhat amended his mind; and now he\nturned not, but went on as before.\n\nAt last the way clomb a hill longer and higher than any he had yet\ncrossed, and when he had come to the brow and looked down, he saw the\nbig river close below running through the wide valley which he had\ncrossed with Roger on that other day.  Then he sat down on the green\nbank above the way, so heavy of heart that not one of the things he saw\ngave him any joy, and the world was naught to him.  But within a while\nhe came somewhat to himself, and, looking down toward the river, he saw\nthat where the road met it, it was very wide, and shallow withal, for\nthe waves rippled merrily and glittered in the afternoon sun, though\nthere was no wind; moreover the road went up white from the water on\nthe other side, so he saw clearly that this was the ford of a highway.\nThe valley was peopled withal: on the other side of the river was a\nlittle thorp, and there were carts and sheds scattered about the hither\nside, and sheep and neat feeding in the meadows, and in short it was\nanother world from the desert.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nRalph Falleth in With Friends and Rideth to Whitwall\n\n\nRalph looks on to the ford and sees folk riding through the thorp\naforesaid and down to the river, and they take the water and are many\nin company, some two score by his deeming, and he sees the sun\nglittering on their weapons.\n\nNow he thought that he would abide their coming and see if he might\njoin their company, since if he crossed the water he would be on the\nbackward way: and it was but a little while ere the head of them came\nup over the hill, and were presently going past Ralph, who rose up to\nlook on them, and be seen of them, but they took little heed of him.\nSo he sees that though they all bore weapons, they were not all\nmen-at-arms, nay, not more than a half score, but those proper men\nenough.  Of the others, some half-dozen seemed by their attire to be\nmerchants, and the rest their lads; and withal they had many sumpter\nhorses and mules with them.  They greeted him not, nor he them, nor did\nhe heed them much till they were all gone by save three, and then he\nleapt into the road with a cry, for who should be riding there but\nBlaise, his eldest brother, and Richard the Red with him, both in good\ncase by seeming; for Blaise was clad in a black coat welted with gold,\nand rode a good grey palfrey, and Richard was armed well and knightly.\n\nThey knew him at once, and drew rein, and Blaise lighted down from his\nhorse and cast his arms about Ralph, and said: \"O happy day! when two\nof the Upmeads kindred meet thus in an alien land!  But what maketh\nthee here, Ralph?  I thought of thee as merry and safe in Upmeads?\"\n\nRalph said smiling, for his heart leapt up at the sight of his kindred:\n\"Nay, must I not seek adventures like the rest?  So I stole myself away\nfrom father and mother.\"  \"Ill done, little lord!\" said Blaise,\nstroking Ralph's cheek.\n\nThen up came Richard, and if Blaise were glad, Richard was twice glad,\nand quoth he:  \"Said I not, Lord Blaise, that this chick would be the\nhardest of all to keep under the coop?  Welcome to the Highways, Lord\nRalph!  But where is thine horse? and whence and whither is it now?\nHast thou met with some foil and been held to ransom?\"\n\nRalph found it hard and grievous and dull work to answer; for now again\nhis sorrow had taken hold of him:  so he said: \"Yea, Richard, I have\nhad adventures, and have lost rather than won; but at least I am a free\nman, and have spent but little gold on my loss.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" said Richard, \"but whence gat ye any gold for\nspending?\" Ralph smiled, but sadly, for he called to mind the glad\nsetting forth and the kind face of dame Katherine his gossip, and he\nsaid: \"Clement Chapman deemed it not unmeet to stake somewhat on my\nluck, therefore I am no pauper.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Blaise, \"if thou hast no great errand elsewhere, thou\nmightest ride with us, brother.  I have had good hap in these days,\nthough scarce kingly or knightly, for I have been buying and selling:\nwhat matter? few know Upmeads and its kings to wite me with fouling a\nfair name.  Richard, go fetch a horse hither for Lord Ralph's riding,\nand we will tarry no longer.\"  So Richard trotted on, and while they\nabode him, Ralph asked after his brethren, and Blaise told him that he\nhad seen or heard naught of them.  Then Ralph asked of whither away,\nand Blaise told him to Whitwall, where was much recourse of merchants\nfrom many lands, and a noble market.\n\nBack then cometh Richard leading a good horse while Ralph was pondering\nhis matter, and thinking that at such a town he might well hear tidings\nconcerning the Well at the World's End.\n\nNow Ralph mounts, and they all ride away together.  On the way, partly\nfor brotherhood's sake, partly that he might not be questioned overmuch\nhimself, Ralph asked Blaise to tell him more of his farings; and Blaise\nsaid, that when he had left Upmeads he had ridden with Richard up and\ndown and round about, till he came to a rich town which had just been\ntaken in war, and that the Companions who had conquered it were looking\nfor chapmen to cheapen their booty, and that he was the first or nearly\nthe first to come who had will and money to buy, and the Companions,\nwho were eager to depart, had sold him thieves' penny-worths, so that\nhis share of the Upmeads' treasure had gone far; and thence he had gone\nto another good town where he had the best of markets for his newly\ncheapened wares, and had brought more there, such as he deemed handy to\nsell, and so had gone on from town to town, and had ever thriven, and\nhad got much wealth:  and so at last having heard tell of Whitwall as\nbetter for chaffer than all he had yet seen, he and other chapmen had\narmed them, and waged men-at-arms to defend them, and so tried the\nadventure of the wildwoods, and come safe through.\n\nThen at last came the question to Ralph concerning his adventures, and\nhe enforced himself to speak, and told all as truly as he might,\nwithout telling of the Lady and her woeful ending.\n\nThus they gave and took in talk, and Ralph did what he might to seem\nlike other folk, that he might nurse his grief in his own heart as far\nasunder from other men as might be.\n\nSo they rode on till it was even, and came to Whitwall before the\nshutting of the gates and rode into the street, and found it a fair and\ngreat town, well defensible, with high and new walls, and men-at-arms\ngood store to garnish them.\n\nRalph rode with his brother to the hostel of the chapmen, and there\nthey were well lodged.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nRichard Talketh With Ralph Concerning the Well at the World's End.\nConcerning Swevenham\n\n\nOn the morrow Blaise went to his chaffer and to visit the men of the\nPort at the Guildhall:  he bade Ralph come with him, but he would not,\nbut abode in the hall of the hostel and sat pondering sadly while men\ncame and went; but he heard no word spoken of the Well at the World's\nEnd.  In like wise passed the next day and the next, save that Richard\nwas among those who came into the hall, and he talked long with Ralph\nat whiles; that is to say that he spake, and Ralph made semblance of\nlistening.\n\nNow as is aforesaid Richard was old and wise, and he loved Ralph much,\nmore belike than Lord Blaise his proper master, whereas he had no mind\nfor chaffer, or aught pertaining to it: so he took heed of Ralph and\nsaw that he was sad and weary-hearted; so on the sixth day of their\nabiding at Whitwall, in the morning when all the chapmen were gone\nabout their business, and he and Ralph were left alone in the Hall, he\nspake to Ralph and said: \"This is no prison, lord.\"  \"Even so,\" quoth\nRalph.  \"Nay, if thou doubtest it,\" said Richard, \"let us go to the\ndoor and try if they have turned the key and shot the bolt on us.\"\nRalph smiled faintly and stood up, and said: \"I will go with thee if\nthou willest it, but sooth to say I shall be but a dull fellow of thine\nto-day.\" Said Richard: \"Wouldst thou have been better yesterday, lord,\nor the day before?\" \"Nay,\" said Ralph.  \"Wilt thou be better\nto-morrow?\" said Richard.  Ralph shook his head.  Said Richard:  \"Yea,\nbut thou wilt be, or thou mayst call me a fool else.\"  \"Thou art kind,\nRichard,\" said Ralph; \"and I will come with thee, and do what thou\nbiddest me; but I must needs tell thee that my heart is sick.\" \"Yea,\"\nquoth Richard, \"and thou needest not tell me so much, dear youngling;\nhe who runs might read that in thee.  But come forth.\"\n\nSo into the street they went, and Richard brought Ralph into the\nmarket-place, and showed him where was Blaise's booth (for he was\nthriving greatly) but Ralph would not go anigh it lest his brother\nshould entangle him in talk; and they went into the Guildhall which was\nboth great and fair, and the smell of the new-shaven oak (for the roof\nwas not yet painted) brought back to Ralph's mind the days of his\nchildhood when he was hanging about the building of the water-reeve's\nnew house at Upmeads.  Then they went into the Great Church and heard a\nMass at the altar of St. Nicholas, Ralph's very friend; and the said\nchurch was great to the letter, and very goodly, and somewhat new also,\nsince the blossom-tide of Whitwall was not many years old: and the\naltars of its chapels were beyond any thing for fairness that Ralph had\nseen save at Higham on the Way.\n\nBut when they came forth from the church, Ralph looked on Richard with\na face that was both blank and weary, as who should say:  \"What is to\ndo now?\" And forsooth so woe-begone he looked, that Richard, despite\nhis sorrow and trouble for him, could scarce withhold his laughter.\nBut he said: \"Well, foster son (for thou art pretty much that to me),\nsince the good town pleasureth thee little, go we further afield.\"\n\nSo he led him out of the market-place, and brought him to the east gate\nof the town which hight Petergate Bar, and forth they went and out into\nthe meadows under the walls, and stayed him at a little bridge over one\nof the streams, for it was a land of many waters; there they sat down\nin a nook, and spake Richard to Ralph, saying:\n\n\"Lord Ralph, ill it were if the Upmeads kindred came to naught, or even\nto little.  Now as for my own master Blaise, he hath, so please you,\nthe makings of a noble chapman, but not of a noble knight; though he\nsayeth that when he is right rich he will cast aside all chaffer;\nnaught of which he will do.  As for the others, my lord Gregory is no\nbetter, or indeed worse, save that he shall not be rich ever, having no\nmastery over himself; while lord Hugh is like to be slain in some empty\nbrawl, unless he come back speedily to Upmeads.\"\n\n\"Yea, yea,\" said Ralph, \"what then?  I came not hither to hear thee\nmissay my mother's sons.\"  But Richard went on: \"As for thee, lord\nRalph, of thee I looked for something; but now I cannot tell; for the\nheart in thee seemeth to be dead; and thou must look to it lest the\nbody die also.\" \"So be it!\" said Ralph.\n\nSaid Richard:  \"I am old now, but I have been young, and many things\nhave I seen and suffered, ere I came to Upmeads.  Old am I, and I\ncannot feel certain hopes and griefs as a young man can; yet have I\nbought the knowledge of them dear enough, and have not forgotten.\nWhereby I wot well that my drearihead is concerning a woman.  Is it not\nso?\"  \"Yea,\" quoth Ralph.  Said Richard:  \"Now shalt thou tell me\nthereof, and so lighten thine heart a little.\"  \"I will not tell thee,\"\nsaid Ralph; \"or, rather, to speak more truly, I cannot.\" \"Yea,\" said\nRichard, \"and though it were now an easier thing for me to tell thee of\nthe griefs of my life than for thee to hearken to the tale, yet I\nbelieve thee.  But mayhappen thou mayst tell me of one thing that thou\ndesirest more than another.\" Said Ralph:  \"I desire to die.\"  And the\ntears started in his eyes therewith.  But Richard spake, smiling on him\nkindly: \"That way is open for thee on any day of the week.  Why hast\nthou not taken it already?\"  But Ralph answered naught.  Richard said:\n\"Is it not because thou hopest to desire something; if not to-day, then\nto-morrow, or the next day or the next?\" Still Ralph spake no word; but\nhe wept.  Quoth Richard:  \"Maybe I may help thee to a hope, though thou\nmayest think my words wild.  In the land and the thorp where I was born\nand bred there was talk now and again of a thing to be sought, which\nshould cure sorrow, and make life blossom in the old, and uphold life\nin the young.\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph, looking up from his tears, \"and what\nwas that? and why hast thou never told me thereof before?\" \"Nay,\" said\nRichard, \"and why should I tell it to the merry lad I knew in Upmeads?\nbut now thou art a man, and hast seen the face of sorrow, it is meet\nthat thou shouldest hear of THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END.\"\n\nRalph sprang to his feet as he said the word, and cried out eagerly:\n\"Old friend, and where then wert thou bred and born?\"  Richard laughed\nand said:  \"See, then, there is yet a deed and a day betwixt thee and\ndeath!  But turn about and look straight over the meadows in a line\nwith yonder willow-tree, and tell me what thou seest.\"  Said Ralph:\n\"The fair plain spreading wide, and a river running through it, and\nlittle hills beyond the water, and blue mountains beyond them, and snow\nyet lying on the tops of them, though the year is in young July.\"\n\"Yea,\" quoth Richard; \"and seest thou on the first of the little hills\nbeyond the river, a great grey tower rising up and houses anigh it?\"\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"the tower I see, and the houses, for I am\nfar-sighted; but the houses are small.\"  \"So it is,\" said Richard; \"now\nyonder tower is of the Church of Swevenham, which is under the\ninvocation of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus; and the houses are the\nhouses of the little town.  And what has that to do with me? sayest\nthou:  why this, that I was born and bred at Swevenham.  And indeed I\nit was who brought my lord Blaise here to Whitwall, with tales of how\ngood a place it was for chaffer, that I might see the little town and\nthe great grey tower once more.  Forsooth I lied not, for thy brother\nis happy here, whereas he is piling up the coins one upon the other.\nForsooth thou shouldest go into his booth, fair lord; it is a goodly\nsight.\"\n\nBut Ralph was walking to and fro hastily, and he turned to Richard and\nsaid: \"Well, well! but why dost thou not tell me more of the Well at\nthe World's End?\"\n\nSaid Richard:  \"I was going to tell thee somewhat which might be worth\nthy noting; or might not be worth it:  hearken!  When I dwelt at\nSwevenham over yonder, and was but of eighteen winters, who am now of\nthree score and eight, three folk of our township, two young men and\none young woman, set out thence to seek the said Well: and much lore\nthey had concerning it, which they had learned of an old man, a nigh\nkinsman of one of them.  This ancient carle I had never seen, for he\ndwelt in the mountains a way off, and these men were some five years\nolder than I, so that I was a boy when they were men grown; and such\nthings I heeded not, but rather sport and play; and above all, I longed\nfor the play of war and battle.  God wot I have had my bellyful of it\nsince those days!  Howbeit I mind me the setting forth of these three.\nThey had a sumpter-ass with them for their livelihood on the waste; but\nthey went afoot crowned with flowers, and the pipe and tabour playing\nbefore them, and much people brought them on the way.  By St.\nChristopher!  I can see it all as if it were yesterday.  I was sorry of\nthe departure of the damsel; for though I was a boy I had loved her,\nand she had suffered me to kiss her and toy with her; but it was soon\nover.  Now I call to mind that they had prayed our priest, Sir Cyprian,\nto bless them on their departure, but he naysaid them; for he held that\nsuch a quest came of the inspiration of the devils, and was but a\nmemory of the customs of the ancient gentiles and heathen.  But as to\nme, I deemed it naught, and was sorry that my white-bosomed,\nsweet-breathed friend should walk away from me thus into the clouds.\"\n\n\"What came of it?\" said Ralph, \"did they come back, or any of them?\" \"I\nwot not,\" said Richard, \"for I was weary of Swevenham after that, so I\ngirt myself to a sword and laid a spear upon my shoulder and went my\nways to the Castle of the Waste March, sixty miles from Swevenham town,\nand the Baron took me in and made me his man: and almost as little\nprofit were in my telling thee again of my deeds there, as there was in\nmy doing them:  but the grey tower of Swevenham I have never seen again\ntill this hour.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Now then it behoveth me to go to Swevenham straightway:\nwilt thou come with me? it seemeth to be but some four miles hence.\"\n\nRichard held his peace and knit his brows as if pondering the matter,\nand Ralph abided till he spake:  so he said: \"Foster-son, so to call\nthee, thou knowest the manner of up-country carles, that tales flow\nforth from them the better if they come without over much digging and\nhoeing of the ground; that is, without questioning; so meseems better\nit will be if I go to Swevenham alone, and better if I be asked to go,\nthan if I go of myself.  Now to-morrow is Saturday, and high market in\nWhitwall; and I am not so old but that it is likeliest that there will\nbe some of my fellows alive and on their legs in Swevenham: and if such\nthere be, there will be one at the least in the market to-morrow, and I\nwill be there to find him out: and then it will go hard if he bring me\nnot to Swevenham as a well-beloved guest; and when I am there, and\ntelling my tidings, and asking them of theirs, if there be any tales\nconcerning the Well at the World's End working in their bellies, then\nshall I be the midwife to bring them to birth.  Ha?  Will it do?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"but how long wilt thou be?\"  Said Richard: \"I shall\ncome back speedily if I find the land barren; but if the field be in\near I shall tarry to harvest it.  So keep thou thy soul in patience.\"\n\"And what shall I do now?\" said Ralph.  \"Wear away the hours,\" said\nRichard.  \"And to begin with, come back within the gates with me and\nlet us go look at thy brother's booth in the market-place: it is the\nnethermost of a goodly house which he is minded to dwell in; and he\nwill marry a wife and sit down in Whitwall, so well he seemeth like to\nthrive; for they have already bidden him to the freedom of the city,\nand to a brother of the Faring-Knights, whereas he is not only a\nstirring man, but of good lineage also: for now he hideth not that he\nis of the Upmeads kindred.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nRalph Falleth in With Another Old Friend\n\n\nRalph went with Richard now without more words, and they came into the\nmarket-place and unto Blaise's booth and house, which was no worse than\nthe best in the place; and the painters and stainers were at work on\nthe upper part of it to make it as bright and goodly as might be with\nred and blue and green and gold, and all fair colours, and already was\nthere a sign hung out of the fruitful tree by the water-side. As for\nthe booth, it was full within of many wares and far-fetched and\ndear-bought things; as pieces of good and fine cloth plumbed with the\nseal of the greatest of the cities; and silk of Babylon, and spices of\nthe hot burning islands, and wonders of the silversmith's and the\ngoldsmith's fashioning, and fair-wrought weapons and armour of the\nbest, and every thing that a rich chapman may deal in.  And amidst of\nit all stood Blaise clad in fine black cloth welted with needle work,\nand a gold chain about his neck.  He was talking with three honourable\nmen of the Port, and they were doing him honour with kind words and the\nbidding of help.  When he saw Ralph and Richard come in, he nodded to\nthem, as to men whom he loved, but were beneath him in dignity, and\nleft not talking with the great men.  Richard grinned a little thereat,\nas also did Ralph in his heart; for he thought: \"Here then is one of\nthe Upmeads kin provided for, so that soon he may buy with his money\ntwo domains as big as Upmeads and call them his manors.\"\n\nNow Ralph looks about him, and presently he sees a man come forward to\nmeet him from the innermost of the booth, and lo! there was come\nClement Chapman.  His heart rose at the sight of him, and he thought of\nhis kind gossip till he could scarce withhold his tears.  But Clement\ncame to him and cast his arms about him, and kissed him, and said:\n\"Thou shalt pardon me for this, lord, for it is the kiss of the gossip\nwhich she bade me give thee, if I fell in with thee, as now I have,\npraised be the Saints!  Yet it irks me that I shall see little more of\nthee at this time, for to-morrow early I must needs join myself to my\ncompany; for we are going south awhile to a good town some fifty miles\nhence.  Nevertheless, if thou dwellest here some eight days I shall see\nthee again belike, since thereafter I get me eastward on a hard and\nlong journey not without peril.  How sayest thou?\"\n\n\"I wot not,\" quoth Ralph looking at Richard.  Said Richard: \"Thou mayst\nwot well, master Clement, that my lord is anhungered of the praise of\nthe folks, and is not like to abide in a mere merchant-town till the\nmould grow on his back.\"  \"Well, well,\" said Clement, \"however that may\nbe, I have now done my matters with this cloth-lord, Blaise, and he has\nmy florins in his pouch: so will not ye twain come with me and drink a\ncup till he hath done his talk with these magnates?\"\n\nRalph was nothing loth, for besides that he loved master Clement, and\nthat his being in company was like having a piece of his home anigh\nhim, he hoped to hear some tidings concerning the Well at the World's\nEnd.\n\nSo he and Richard went with master Clement to the Christopher, a fair\nale-house over against the Great Church, and sat down to good wine; and\nRalph asked of Clement many things concerning dame Katherine his\ngossip, and Clement told him all, and that she was well, and had been\nto Upmeads, and had seen King Peter and the mother of Ralph; and how\nshe had assuaged his mother's grief at his departure by forecasting\nfair days for her son.  All this Ralph heard gladly, though he was\nsomewhat shamefaced withal, and sat silent and thinking of many\nmatters.  But Richard took up the word and said: \"Which way camest thou\nfrom Wulstead, master Clement?\"  \"The nighest way I came,\" said\nClement, \"through the Woods Perilous.\"  Said Richard: \"And they of the\nDry Tree, heardest thou aught of them?\"  \"Yea, certes,\" quoth Clement,\n\"for I fell in with their Bailiff, and paid him due scot for the\npassage of the Wood; he knoweth me withal, and we talked together.\"\n\"And had he any tidings to tell thee of the champions?\" said Richard.\nSaid Clement, \"Great tidings maybe, how that there was a rumour that\nthey had lost their young Queen and Lady; and if that be true, it will\ngo nigh to break their hearts, so sore as they loved her.  And that\nwill make them bitter and fierce, till their grief has been slaked by\nthe blood of men.  And that the more as their old Queen abideth still,\nand she herself is ever of that mind.\"\n\nRalph hearkened, and his heart was wounded that other men should speak\nof his beloved:  but he heard how Richard said:  \"Hast thou ever known\nwhy that company of champions took the name of the Dry Tree?\"  \"Why,\nwho should know that, if thou knowest it not, Richard of Swevenham?\"\nsaid Clement: \"Is it not by the token of the Dry Tree that standeth in\nthe lands on the hither side of the Wall of the World?\"  Richard nodded\nhis head; but Ralph cried out:  \"O Master Clement, and hast thou seen\nit, the Wall of the World?\" \"Yea, afar off, my son,\" said he; \"or what\nthe folk with me called so; as to the Dry Tree, I have told thee at\nWulstead that I have seen it not, though I have known men who have told\nme that they have seen it.\" \"And must they who find the Well at the\nWorld's End come by the Dry Tree?\" \"Yea, surely,\" said Clement.  Quoth\nRichard:  \"And thus have some heard, who have gone on that quest, and\nthey have heard of the Champions of Hampton, and have gone thither,\nbeing deceived by that name of the Dry Tree, and whiles have been slain\nby the champions, whiles have entered their company.\" \"Yea,\" said\nClement, \"so it is that their first error hath ended their quest.  But\nnow, lord Ralph, I will tell thee one thing; to wit, that when I return\nhither after eight days wearing, I shall be wending east, as I said\ne'en now, and what will that mean save going somewhat nigher to the\nWall of the World; for my way lieth beyond the mountains that ye see\nfrom hence, and beyond the mountains that lie the other side of those;\nand I bid thee come with us, and I will be thy warrant that so far thou\nshalt have no harm: but when thou hast come so far, and hast seen three\nvery fair cities, besides towns and castles and thorps and strange men,\nand fair merchandize, God forbid that thou shouldest wend further, and\nso cast away thy young life for a gay-coloured cloud.  Then will be the\ntime to come back with me, that I may bring thee through the perils of\nthe way to Wulstead, and Upmeads at the last, and the folk that love\nthee.\"\n\nRichard held his peace at this word, but Ralph said: \"I thank thee,\nMaster Clement, for thy love and thy helping hand; and will promise\nthee to abide thee here eight days at the least; and meanwhile I will\nponder the matter well.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nRalph Dreams a Dream Or Sees a Vision\n\n\nTherewithall they parted after more talk concerning small matters, and\nRalph wore through the day, but Richard again did him to wit, that on\nthe morrow he would find his old friends of Swevenham in the Market.\nAnd Ralph was come to life again more than he had been since that evil\nhour in the desert; though hard and hard he deemed it that he should\nnever see his love again.\n\nNow as befalleth young men, he was a good sleeper, and dreamed but\nseldom, save such light and empty dreams as he might laugh at, if\nperchance he remembered them by then his raiment was on him in the\nmorning.  But that night him-seemed that he awoke in his chamber at\nWhitwall, and was lying on his bed, as he verily was, and the door of\nthe chamber opened, and there entered quietly the Lady of the Woodland,\ndight even as he had seen her as she lay dead beside their cooking fire\non that table of greensward in the wilderness, barefoot and garlanded\nabout her brow and her girdlestead, but fair and fresh coloured as she\nwas before the sword had pierced her side; and he thought that he\nrejoiced to see her, but no wild hope rose in his heart, and no sobbing\npassion blinded his eyes, nor did he stretch out hand to touch her,\nbecause he remembered that she was dead.  But he thought she spake to\nhim and said:  \"I know that thou wouldst have me speak, therefore I say\nthat I am come to bid thee farewell, since there was no farewell\nbetween us in the wilderness, and I know that thou are about going on a\nlong and hard and perilous journey: and I would that I could kiss thee\nand embrace thee, but I may not, for this is but the image of me as\nthou hast known me.  Furthermore, as I loved thee when I saw thee\nfirst, for thy youth, and thy fairness, and thy kindness and thy\nvaliancy, so now I rejoice that all this shall endure so long in thee,\nas it surely shall.\"\n\nThen the voice ceased, but still the image stood before him awhile, and\nhe wondered if she would speak again, and tell him aught of the way to\nthe Well at the World's End; and she spake again: \"Nay,\" she said, \"I\ncannot, since we may not tread the way together hand in hand; and this\nis part of the loss that thou hast had of me; and oh! but it is hard\nand hard.\"  And her face became sad and distressful, and she turned and\ndeparted as she had come.\n\nThen he knew not if he awoke, or if it were a change in his dream; but\nthe chamber became dark about him, and he lay there thinking of her,\ntill, as it seemed, day began to dawn, and there was some little stir\nin the world without, and the new wind moved the casement.  And again\nthe door opened, and someone entered as before; and this also was a\nwoman:  green-clad she was and barefoot, yet he knew at once that it\nwas not his love that was dead, but the damsel of the ale-house of\nBourton, whom he had last seen by the wantways of the Wood Perilous,\nand he thought her wondrous fair, fairer than he had deemed.  And the\nword came from her:  \"I am a sending of the woman whom thou hast loved,\nand I should not have been here save she had sent me.\" Then the words\nended, while he looked at her and wondered if she also had died on the\nway to the Well at the World's End.  And it came into his mind that he\nhad never known her name upon the earth.  Then again came the word:\n\"So it is that I am not dead but alive in the world, though I am far\naway from this land; and it is good that thou shouldst go seek the Well\nat the World's End not all alone: and the seeker may find me:  and\nwhereas thou wouldst know my name, I hight Dorothea.\"\n\nSo fell the words again:  and this image stood awhile as the other had\ndone, and as the other had done, departed, and once more the chamber\nbecame dark, so that Ralph could not so much as see where was the\nwindow, and he knew no more till he woke in the early morn, and there\nwas stir in the street and the voice of men, and the scent of fresh\nherbs and worts, and fruits; for it was market-day, and the country\nfolk were early afoot, that they might array their wares timely in the\nmarket-place.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nOf the Tales of Swevenham\n\n\nOld Richard was no worse than his word, and failed not to find old\nacquaintance of Swevenham in the Saturday's market: and Ralph saw\nnaught of him till midweek afterwards.  And he was sitting in the\nchamber of the hostel when Richard came in to him.  Forsooth Blaise had\nbidden him come dwell in his fair house, but Ralph would not, deeming\nthat he might be hindered in his quest and be less free to go whereso\nhe would, if he were dwelling with one who was so great with the\nmagnates as was Blaise.\n\nNow Ralph was reading in a book when Richard came in, but he stood up\nand greeted him; and Richard said smiling: \"What have ye found in the\nbook, lord?\"  Said Ralph: \"It telleth of the deeds of Alexander.\"  \"Is\nthere aught concerning the Well at the World's End therein?\" said\nRichard.  \"I have not found aught thereof as yet,\" said Ralph; \"but the\nbook tells concerning the Dry Tree, and of kings sitting in their\nchairs in the mountains nearby.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Richard, \"maybe thou wilt think me the better\ntale-teller.\" \"Tell on then,\" quoth Richard.  So they went and sat them\ndown in a window, and Richard said:\n\n\"When I came to Swevenham with two old men that I had known young, the\nfolk made much of me, and made me good cheer, whereof were over long to\ntell thee; but to speak shortly, I drew the talk round to the matter\nthat we would wot of:  for we spake of the Men of the Dry Tree, and an\nold man began to say, as master Clement the other day, that this name\nof theirs was but a token and an armoury which those champions have\ntaken from the Tree itself, which Alexander the Champion saw in his\nwayfarings; and he said that this tree was on the hither side of the\nmountains called the Wall of the World, and no great way from the last\nof the towns whereto Clement will wend; for Clement told me the name\nthereof, to wit, Goldburg.  Then another and an older man, one that I\nremember a stout carle ere I left Swevenham, said that this was not so,\nbut that the Tree was on the further side of the Wall of the World, and\nthat he who could lay his hand on the bole thereof was like enough to\ndrink of the Well at the World's End.  Thereafter another spake, and\ntold a tale of how the champions at Hampton first took the Dry Tree for\na token; and he said that the rumour ran, that a woman had brought the\ntidings thereof to those valiant men, and had fixed the name upon them,\nthough wherefore none knew.  So the talk went on.\n\n\"But there was a carline sitting in the ingle, and she knew me and I\nher.  And indeed in days past, when I was restless and longing to\ndepart, she might have held me at Swevenham, for she was one of the\nfriends that I loved there: a word and a kiss had done it, or maybe the\nkiss without the word: but if I had the word, I had not the kiss of\nher.  Well, when the talk began to fall, she spake and said to me:\n\n\"'Now it is somewhat strange that the talk must needs fall on this\nseeking of that which shall not be found, whereas it was but the month\nbefore thou wert last at Swevenham, that Wat Miller and Simon Bowyer\nset off to seek the Well at the World's End, and took with them Alice\nof Queenhough, whom Simon loved as well as might be, and Wat somewhat\nmore than well.  Mindest thou not?  There are more than I alive that\nremember it.'\n\n\"'Yea,' said I, 'I remember it well.'\n\n\"For indeed, foster-son, these were the very three of whom I told thee,\nthough I told thee not their names.\n\n\"'Well,' said I; 'how sped they?  Came they back, or any of them?'\n'Nay,' she said, 'that were scarce to be looked for.'  Said I: 'Have\nany other to thy knowledge gone on this said quest?'\n\n\"'Yea,' she said, 'I will tell thee all about it, and then there will\nbe an end of the story, for none knoweth better thereof than I. First\nthere was that old man, the wizard, to whom folk from Swevenham and\nother places about were used to seek for his lore in hidden matters;\nand some months after those three had departed, folk who went to his\nabode amongst the mountains found him not; and soon the word was about\nthat he also, for as feeble as he was, had gone to seek the Well at the\nWorld's End; though may-happen it was not so.  Then the next spring\nafter thy departure, Richard, comes home Arnold Wright from the wars,\nand asks after Alice; and when he heard what had befallen, he takes a\nscrip with a little meat for the road, lays his spear on his shoulder,\nand is gone seeking the lost, and the thing which they found not--that,\nI deem, was the end of him.  Again the year after that, as I deem,\nthree of our carles fell in with two knights riding east from Whitwall,\nand were questioned of them concerning the road to the said Well, and\ndoubted not but that they were on that quest.  Furthermore (and some of\nyou wot this well enough, and more belike know it not) two of our young\nmen were faring by night and cloud on some errand, good or bad, it\nmatters not, on the highway thirty miles east of Whitwall: it was after\nharvest, and the stubble-fields lay on either side of the way, and the\nmoon was behind thin clouds, so that it was light on the way, as they\ntold me; and they saw a woman wending before them afoot, and as they\ncame up with her, the moon ran out, and they saw that the woman was\nfair, and that about her neck was a chaplet of gems that shone in the\nmoon, and they had a longing both for the jewel and the woman:  but\nbefore they laid hand on her they asked her of whence and whither, and\nshe said: From ruin and wrack to the Well at the World's End, and\ntherewith turned on them with a naked sword in her hand; so that they\nshrank from before her.\n\n\"'Hearken once more:  the next year came a knight to Swevenham, and\nguested in this same house, and he sat just where sitteth now yon\nyellow-headed swain, and the talk went on the same road as it hath gone\nto-night; and I told him all the tale as I have said it e'en now; and\nhe asked many questions, but most of the Lady with the pair of beads.\nAnd on the morrow he departed and we saw him not again.\n\n\"Then she was silent, but the young man at whom she had pointed blushed\nred and stared at her wide-eyed, but said no word.  But I spake:  'Well\ndame, but have none else gone from Swevenham, or what hath befallen\nthem?'\n\n\"She said:  'Hearken yet!  Twenty years agone a great sickness lay\nheavy upon us and the folk of Whitwall, and when it was at its worst,\nfive of our young men, calling to mind all the tales concerning the\nWell at the World's End, went their ways to seek it, and swore that\nback would they never, save they found it and could bear its water to\nthe folk of Swevenham; and I suppose they kept their oath; for we saw\nnaught either of the water or of them.  Well, I deem that this is the\nlast that I have to tell thee, Richard, concerning this matter: and now\nis come the time for thee to tell tales of thyself.'\n\n\"Thus for that time dropped the talk of the Well at the World's End,\nLord Ralph, and of the way thither.  But I hung about the township yet\na while, and yesterday as I stood on their stone bridge, and looked on\nthe water, up comes that long lad with the yellow hair that the dame\nhad pointed at, and says to me: 'Master Richard, saving thine age and\nthy dignity and mastery, I can join an end to the tale which the\ncarline began on Sunday night.'  'Yea, forsooth?' said I, 'and how, my\nlad?' Said he:  'Thou hast a goodly knife there in thy girdle, give it\nto me, and I will tell thee.'  'Yea,' quoth I, 'if thy tale be\nknife-worthy.'\n\n\"Well, the end of it was that he told me thus: That by night and moon\nhe came on one riding the highway, just about where the other woman had\nbeen seen, whose tale he had heard of.  He deemed at first this rider\nto be a man, or a lad rather for smallness and slenderness, but coming\nclose up he found it was a woman, and saw on her neck a chaplet of\ngems, and deemed it no great feat to take it of her: but he asked her\nof whence and whither, and she answered:\n\n\"'From unrest to the Well at the World's End.'\n\n\"Then when he put out his hand to her, he saw a great anlace gleaming\nin her hand, wherefore he forbore her; and this was but five days ago.\n\n\"So I gave the lad my knife, and deemed there would be little else to\nhear in Swevenham for this bout; and at least I heard no more tales to\ntell till I came away this morning; so there is my poke turned inside\nout for thee.  But this word further would I say to thee, that I have\nseen on thy neck also a pair of beads exceeding goodly.  Tell me now\nwhence came they.\"\n\n\"From my gossip, dame Katherine,\" said Ralph; \"and it seems to me now,\nthough at the time I heeded the gift little save for its kindness, that\nshe thought something great might go with it; and there was a monk at\nHigham on the Way, who sorely longed to have it of me.\"  \"Well,\" said\nRichard, \"that may well come to pass, that it shall lead thee to the\nWell at the World's End.  But as to the tales of Swevenham, what\ndeemest thou of them?\" Said Ralph:  \"What are they, save a token that\nfolk believe that there is such a thing on earth as the Well?  Yet I\nhave made up my mind already that I would so do as if I trowed in it.\nSo I am no nearer to it than erst.  Now is there naught for it save to\nabide Master Clement's coming; and when he hath brought me to Goldburg,\nthen shall I see how the quest looks by the daylight of that same\ncity.\" He spake so cheerfully that Richard looked at him askance,\nwondering what was toward with him, and if mayhappen anything lay\nunderneath those words of his.\n\nBut in his heart Ralph was thinking of that last tale of the woman whom\nthe young man had met such a little while ago; and it seemed to him\nthat she must have been in Whitwall when he first came there; and he\nscarce knew whether he were sorry or not that he had missed her: for\nthough it seemed to him that it would be little more than mere grief\nand pain, nay, that it would be wicked and evil to be led to the Well\nat the World's End by any other than her who was to have brought him\nthere; yet he longed, or thought he longed to speak with her concerning\nthat love of his heart, so early rewarded, so speedily beggared.  For\nindeed he doubted not that the said woman was the damsel of Bourton\nAbbas, whose image had named herself Dorothea to him in that dream.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nRichard Bringeth Tidings of Departing\n\n\nFell the talk between them at that time, and three days wore, and on\nthe morning of the fourth day came Richard to Ralph, and said to him:\n\"Foster-son, I am sorry for the word I must say, but Clement Chapman\ncame within the gates this morning early, and the company with which he\nis riding are alboun for the road, and will depart at noon to-day, so\nthat there are but four hours wherein we twain may be together; and\nthereafter whatso may betide thee, it may well be, that I shall see thy\nface no more; so what thou wilt tell me must be told straightway.  And\nnow I will say this to thee, that of all things I were fain to ride\nwith thee, but I may not, because it is Blaise whom I am bound to serve\nin all ways.  And I deem, moreover, that troublous times may be at hand\nhere in Whitwall.  For there is an Earl hight Walter the Black, a fair\nyoung man outwardly, but false at heart and a tyrant, and he had some\noccasion against the good town, and it was looked for that he should\nsend his herald here to defy the Port more than a half moon ago; but\nabout that time he was hurt in a fray as we hear, and may not back a\nhorse in battle yet.  Albeit, fristed is not forgotten, as saith the\nsaw; and when he is whole again, we may look for him at our gates; and\nwhereas Blaise knows me for a deft man-at-arms or something more, it is\nnot to be looked for that he will give me to thee for this quest.  Nay,\nof thee also it will be looked for that thou shouldest do knightly\nservice to the Port, and even so Blaise means it to be; therefore have\nI lied to him on thy behalf, and bidden Clement also to lie (which\nforsooth he may do better than I, since he wotteth not wholly whither\nthou art minded), and I have said thou wouldst go with Clement no\nfurther than Cheaping Knowe, which lieth close to the further side of\nthese mountains, and will be back again in somewhat more than a\nhalf-moon's wearing.  So now thou art warned hereof.\"\n\nRalph was moved by these words of Richard, and he spake: \"Forsooth, old\nfriend, I am sorry to depart from thee; yet though I shall presently be\nall alone amongst aliens, yet now is manhood rising again in me.  So\nfor that cause at least shall I be glad to be on the way; and as a\ntoken that I am more whole than I was, I will now tell thee the tale of\nmy grief, if thou wilt hearken to it, which the other day I might not\ntell thee.\"\n\n\"I will hearken it gladly,\" said Richard.  And therewith they sat down\nin a window, for they were within doors in the hostel, and Ralph told\nall that had befallen him as plainly and shortly as he might; and when\nhe had done, Richard said:\n\n\"Thou has had much adventure in a short space, lord, and if thou\nmightest now refrain thy longing for that which is gone, and set it on\nthat which is to come, thou mayest yet harden into a famous knight and\na happy man.\" Said Ralph:  \"Yea? now tell me all thy thought.\"\n\nSaid Richard:  \"My thought is that this lady who was slain, was scarce\nwholly of the race of Adam; but that at the least there was some\nblending in her of the blood of the fays.  Or how deemest thou?\"\n\n\"I wot not,\" said Ralph sadly; \"to me she seemed but a woman, though\nshe were fairer and wiser than other women.\"  Said Richard: \"Well,\nfurthermore, if I heard thee aright, there is another woman in the tale\nwho is also fairer and wiser than other women?\"\n\n\"I would she were my sister!\" said Ralph.  \"Yea,\" quoth Richard, \"and\ndost thou bear in mind what she was like?  I mean the fashion of her\nbody.\" \"Yea, verily,\" said Ralph.\n\nAgain said Richard:  \"Doth it seem to thee as if the Lady of the Dry\nTree had some inkling that thou shouldst happen upon this other woman:\nwhereas she showed her of the road to the Well at the World's End, and\ngave her that pair of beads, and meant that thou also shouldest go\nthither?  And thou sayest that she praised her,--her beauty and wisdom.\nIn what wise did she praise her? how came the words forth from her?\nwas it sweetly?\"\n\n\"Like honey and roses for sweetness,\" said Ralph.  \"Yea,\" said Richard,\n\"and she might have praised her in such wise that the words had came\nforth like gall and vinegar.  Now I will tell thee of my thought, since\nwe be at point of sundering, though thou take it amiss and be wroth\nwith me: to wit, that thou wouldst have lost the love of this lady as\ntime wore, even had she not been slain:  and she being, if no fay, yet\nwiser than other women, and foreseeing, knew that so it would be.\"\nRalph brake in:  \"Nay, nay, it is not so, it is not so!\" \"Hearken,\nyoungling!\" quoth Richard; \"I deem that it was thus.  Her love for thee\nwas so kind that she would have thee happy after the sundering:\ntherefore she was minded that thou shouldest find the damsel, who as I\ndeem loveth thee, and that thou shouldest love her truly.\"\n\n\"O nay, nay!\" said Ralph, \"all this guess of thine is naught, saying\nthat she was kind indeed.  Even as heaven is kind to them who have died\nmartyrs, and enter into its bliss after many torments.\"\n\nAnd therewith he fell a-weeping at the very thought of her great\nkindness: for indeed to this young man she had seemed great, and\nexalted far above him.\n\nRichard looked at him a while; and then said:  \"Now, I pray thee be not\nwroth with me for the word I have spoken.  But something more shall I\nsay, which shall like thee better.  To wit, when I came back from\nSwevenham on Wednesday I deemed it most like that the Well at the\nWorld's End was a tale, a coloured cloud only; or that at most if it\nwere indeed on the earth, that thou shouldest never find it.  But now\nis my mind changed by the hearing of thy tale, and I deem both that the\nWell verily is, and that thou thyself shalt find it; and that the wise\nLady knew this, and set the greater store by thy youth and goodliness,\nas a richer and more glorious gift than it had been, were it as\nfleeting as such things mostly be.  Now of this matter will I say no\nmore; but I think that the words that I have said, and which now seem\nso vain to thee, shall come into thy mind on some later day, and avail\nthee somewhat; and that is why I have spoken them.  But this again is\nanother word, that I have got a right good horse for thee, and other\ngear, such as thou mayest need for the road, and that Clement's\nfellowship will meet in Petergate hard by the church, and I will be thy\nsquire till thou comest thither, and ridest thence out a-gates.  Now I\nsuppose that thou will want to bid Blaise farewell: yet thou must look\nto it that he will not deem thy farewell of great moment, since he\nswimmeth in florins and goodly wares; and moreover deemeth that thou\nwilt soon be back here.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Ralph, \"I must needs cast my arms about my own\nmother's son before I depart:  so go we now, as all this talk hath worn\naway more than an hour of those four that were left me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nRalph Departeth From Whitwall With the Fellowship of Clement Chapman\n\n\nTherewithal they went together to Blaise's house, and when Blaise saw\nthem, he said:  \"Well, Ralph, so thou must needs work at a little more\nidling before thou fallest to in earnest.  Forsooth I deem that when\nthou comest back thou wilt find that we have cut thee out a goodly\npiece of work for thy sewing.  For the good town is gathering a gallant\nhost of men; and we shall look to thee to do well in the hard\nhand-play, whenso that befalleth.  But now come and look at my house\nwithin, how fair it is, and thou wilt see that thou wilt have somewhat\nto fight for, whereas I am.\"\n\nTherewith he led them up a stair into the great chamber, which was all\nnewly dight and hung with rich arras of the Story of Hercules; and\nthere was a goodly cupboard of silver vessel, and some gold, and the\ncupboard was of five shelves as was but meet for a king's son.  So\nRalph praised all, but was wishful to depart, for his heart was sore,\nand he blamed himself in a manner that he must needs lie to his brother.\n\nBut Blaise brought them to the upper chamber, and showed them the\ngoodly beds with their cloths, and hangings, and all was as fair as\nmight be.  Then Blaise bade bring wine and made them drink; and he gave\nRalph a purse of gold, and an anlace very fair of fashion, and brought\nhim to the door thereafter; and Ralph cast his arms about him, and\nkissed him and strained him to his breast.  But Blaise was somewhat\nmoved thereat, and said to him:  \"Why lad, thou art sorry to depart\nfrom me for a little while, and what would it be, were it for long?\nBut ever wert thou a kind and tender-hearted youngling, and we twain\nare alone in an alien land.  Forsooth, I wot that thou hast, as it\nwere, embraced the Upmeads kindred, father, mother and all; and good is\nthat!  So now God and the Saints keep thee, and bear in mind the\nhosting of the good town, and the raising of the banner, that shall be\nno great while.  Fare thee well, lad!\"\n\nSo they parted, and Ralph went back to the hostel, and gathered his\nstuff together, and laid it on a sumpter horse, and armed him, and so\nwent into Petergate to join himself to that company.  There he found\nthe chapmen, five of them in all, and their lads, and a score of\nmen-at-arms, with whom was Clement, not clad like a merchant, but\nweaponed, and bearing a coat of proof and a bright sallet on his head.\n\nThey greeted each the other, and Ralph said:  \"Yea, master Clement, and\nbe we riding to battle?\"  \"Maybe,\" quoth Clement; \"the way is long, and\nour goods worth the lifting, and there are some rough places that we\nmust needs pass through.  But if ye like not the journey, abide here in\nthis town the onset of Walter the Black.\"\n\nTherewith he laughed, and Ralph understanding the jape, laughed also;\nand said:  \"Well, master Clement, but tell me who be these that we\nshall meet.\"  \"Yea, and I will tell thee the whole tale of them,\" said\nClement, \"but abide till we are without the gates; I am busy man e'en\nnow, for all is ready for the road, save what I must do.  So now bid\nthy Upmeads squire farewell, and then to horse with thee!\"\n\nSo Ralph cast his arms about Richard, and kissed him and said: \"This is\nalso a farewell to the House where I was born and bred.\" And as he\nspake the thought of the House and the garden, and the pleasant fields\nof Upmeads came into his heart so bitter-sweet, that it mingled with\nhis sorrow, and well-nigh made him weep.  But as for Richard he\nforebore words, for he was sad at heart for the sundering.\n\nThen he gat to horse, and the whole company of them bestirred them, and\nthey rode out a-gates. And master Clement it was that ordered them,\nriding up and down along the array.\n\nBut Ralph fell to speech with the chapmen and men-at-arms; and both of\nthese were very courteous with him; for they rejoiced in his company,\nand especially the chapmen, who were somewhat timorous of the perils of\nthe road.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nMaster Clement Tells Ralph Concerning the Lands Whereunto They Were\nRiding\n\n\nWhen they were gotten a mile or two from Whitwall, and all was going\nsmoothly, Clement came up to Ralph and rode at his left hand, and fell\nto speech with him, and said: \"Now, lord, will I tell thee more\nconcerning our journey, and the folk that we are like to meet upon the\nroad.  And of the perils, whatso they may be, I told thee not before,\nbecause I knew thee desirous of seeking adventures east-away, and knew\nthat my tales would not hinder thee.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and had not this goodly fellowship been, I had gone\nalone, or with any carle that I could have lightly hired.\"\n\nClement laughed and said:  \"Fair sir, thou wouldst have failed of\nhiring any one man to go with thee east-ward a many miles.  For with\nless than a score of men well-armed the danger of death or captivity is\nover great, if ye ride the mountain ways unto Cheaping Knowe.  Yea, and\neven if a poor man who hath nothing, wend that way alone, he may well\nfall among thieves, and be stolen himself body and bones, for lack of\nanything better to steal.\"\n\nHereat Ralph felt his heart rise, when he thought of battle and strife,\nand he made his horse to spring somewhat, and then he said: \"It liketh\nme well, dear friend, that I ride not with thee for naught, but that I\nmay earn my daily bread like another.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Clement, looking on him kindly, \"I deem of all thy brethren\nthou hast the biggest share of the blood of Red Robert, who first won\nUpmeads.  And now thou shalt know that this good town of Whitwall that\nlieth behind us is the last of the lands we shall come to wherein folk\ncan any courtesy, or are ruled by the customs of the manor, or by due\nlawful Earls and Kings, or the laws of the Lineage or the Port, or have\nany Guilds for their guiding, and helping.  And though these folks\nwhereunto we shall come, are, some of them, Christian men by name, and\nhave amongst them priests and religious; yet are they wild men of\nmanners, and many heathen customs abide amongst them; as swearing on\nthe altars of devils, and eating horse-flesh at the High-tides, and\nspell-raising more than enough, and such like things, even to the\nreddening of the doom-rings with the blood of men and of women, yea,\nand of babes:  from such things their priests cannot withhold them.  As\nfor their towns that we shall come to, I say not but we shall find\ncrafts amongst them, and worthy good men therein, but they have little\nmight against the tyrants who reign over the towns, and who are of no\ngreat kindred, nor of blood better than other folk, but merely\nmasterful and wise men who have gained their place by cunning and the\nhigh hand.  Thou shalt see castles and fair strong-houses about the\ncountry-side, but the great men who dwell therein are not the natural\nkindly lords of the land yielding service to Earls, Dukes, and Kings,\nand having under them vavassors and villeins, men of the manor; but\ntheir tillers and shepherds and workmen and servants be mere thralls,\nwhom they may sell at any market, like their horses or oxen.  Forsooth\nthese great men have with them for the more part free men waged for\ntheir service, who will not hold their hands from aught that their\nmaster biddeth, not staying to ask if it be lawful or unlawful.  And\nthat the more because whoso is a free man there, house and head must he\nhold on the tenure of bow and sword, and his life is like to be short\nif he hath not sworn himself to the service of some tyrant of a castle\nor a town.\"\n\n\"Yea, master Clement,\" said Ralph, \"these be no peaceful lands whereto\nthou art bringing us, or very pleasant to dwell in.\"\n\n\"Little for peace, but much for profit,\" said Clement; \"for these lands\nbe fruitful of wine and oil and wheat, and neat and sheep; withal\nmetals and gems are dug up out of the mountains; and on the other hand,\nthey make but little by craftsmanship, wherefore are they the eagerer\nfor chaffer with us merchants; whereas also there are many of them well\nable to pay for what they lack, if not in money, then in kind, which in\na way is better.  Yea, it is a goodly land for merchants.\"\n\n\"But I am no merchant,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"So it is,\" said Clement, \"yet thou desireth something; and whither we\nare wending thou mayst hear tidings that shall please thee, or tidings\nthat shall please me.  To say sooth, these two may well be adverse to\neach other, for I would not have thee hear so much of tidings as shall\nlead thee on, but rather I would have thee return with me, and not\nthrow thy young life away: for indeed I have an inkling of what thou\nseekest, and meseems that Death and the Devil shall be thy\nfaring-fellows.\"\n\nRalph held his peace, and Clement said in a cheerfuller voice:\n\"Moreover, there shall be strange and goodly things to see; and the men\nof these parts be mostly goodly of body, and the women goodlier yet, as\nwe carles deem.\"\n\nRalph sighed, and answered not at once, but presently he said: \"Master\nClement, canst thou give me the order of our goings for these next\ndays?\"  \"Yea, certes,\" said Clement.  \"In three days' time we shall\ncome to the entry of the mountains: two days thence we shall go without\ncoming under any roof save the naked heavens; the day thereafter shall\nwe come to the Mid-Mountain House, which is as it were an hostelry; but\nit was built and is upheld by the folks that dwell anigh, amongst whom\nbe the folk of Cheaping Knowe; and that house is hallowed unto truce,\nand no man smiteth another therein; so that we oft come on the mountain\nstrong-thieves there, and there we be blithe together and feast\ntogether in good fellowship.  But when there be foemen in that house\ntogether, each man or each fellowship departing, hath grace of an hour\nbefore his foeman follow.  Such are the customs of that house, and no\nman breaketh them ever.  But when we depart thence we shall ride all\nday and sleep amidst the mountains, and if we be not beset that night\nor the morrow's morn thereof, safe and unfoughten shall we come to\nCheaping Knowe.  Doth that suffice thee as at this time?\" \"Yea master,\"\nquoth Ralph.\n\nSo therewith their talk dropped, for the moment; but Clement talked\nmuch with Ralph that day, and honoured him much, as did all that\ncompany.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nThey Come to the Mid-Mountain Guest-House\n\n\nOn that night they slept in their tents which they had pitched on the\nfield of a little thorp beside a water; and there they had meat and\ndrink and all things as they needed them.  And in likewise it befell\nthem the next day; but the third evening they set up their tents on a\nlittle hillside by a road which led into a deep pass, even the entry of\nthe mountains, a road which went betwixt exceeding high walls of rock.\nFor the mountain sides went up steep from the plain.  There they kept\ngood watch and ward, and naught befell them to tell of.\n\nThe next morning they entered the pass, and rode through it up to the\nheaths, and rode all day by wild and stony ways and came at even to a\ngrassy valley watered by a little stream, where they guested, watching\ntheir camp well; and again none meddled with them.\n\nAs they were departing the next morn Ralph asked of Clement if he yet\nlooked for onset from the waylayers.  Said Clement: \"It is most like,\nlord; for we be a rich prey, and it is but seldom that such a company\nrideth this road.  And albeit that the wild men know not to a day when\nwe shall pass through their country, yet they know the time within a\nfour and twenty hours or so.  For we may not hide our journey from all\nmen's hearing; and when the ear heareth, the tongue waggeth.  But art\nthou yet anxious concerning this matter, son?\"  \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"for\nI would fain look on these miscreants.\"\n\n\"It is like that ye shall see them,\" said Clement; \"but I shall look on\nit as a token that they are about waylaying us if we come on none of\nthem in the Mountain House.  For they will be fearful lest their\npurpose leak out from unwary lips.\" Ralph wondered how it would be, and\nwhat might come of it, and rode on, pondering much.\n\nThe road was rough that day, and they went not above a foot-pace the\nmore part of the time; and daylong they were going up and up, and it\ngrew cold as the sun got low; though it was yet summer.  At last at the\ntop of a long stony ridge, which lay beneath a great spreading\nmountain, on the crest whereof the snow lay in plenty, Ralph saw a\nhouse, long and low, builded of great stones, both walls and roof: at\nsight thereof the men of the fellowship shouted for joy, and hastened\non, and Clement spurred up the stony slopes all he might.  But Ralph\nrode slowly, since he had naught to see to, save himself, so that he\nwas presently left alone.  Now he looks aside, and sees something\nbright-hued lying under a big stone where the last rays of the sun just\ncaught some corner of it.  So he goes thither, deeming that mayhappen\none of the company had dropped something, pouch or clout, or what not,\nin his haste and hurry.  He got off his horse to pick it up, and when\nhe had laid hand on it found it to be a hands-breadth of fine green\ncloth embroidered with flowers.  He held it in his hand a while\nwondering where he could have seen such like stuff before, that it\nshould smite a pang into his heart, and suddenly called to mind the\nlittle hall at Bourton Abbas with the oaken benches and the rush-strewn\nfloor, and this same flower-broidered green cloth dancing about the\nnaked feet of a fair damsel, as she moved nimbly hither and thither\ndighting him his bever.  But his thought stayed not there, but carried\nhim into the days when he was abiding in desire of the love that he won\nat last, and lost so speedily.  But as he stood pondering he heard\nClement shouting to him from the garth-gate of that house.  So he leapt\non his horse and rode up the slope into the garth and lighted down by\nClement; who fell to chiding him for tarrying, and said: \"There is\nperil in loitering outside this garth alone; for those Sons of the Rope\noften lurk hard by for what they may easily pick up, and they be brisk\nand nimble lads.\"  \"What ailed thee?\" said Ralph.  \"I stayed to look at\na flower which called Upmeads to my mind.\"\n\n\"Yea lad, yea,\" quoth Clement, \"and art thou so soft as that?  But come\nthou into the House; it is as I deemed it might be; besides the\nHouse-warden and his wife there is no soul therein.  Thou shalt yet\nlook on Mick Hangman's sons, as thou desirest.\"\n\nSo they went into the House, and men had all that they might need.  The\nwarden was an old hoar man, and his wife well-stricken in years; and\nafter supper was talk of this and that, and it fell much, as was like\nto be, on those strong-thieves, and Clement asked the warden what he\nhad seen of them of late.\n\nThe old carle answered:  \"Nay, master Clement, much according to wont:\na few beeves driven into our garth; a pack or two brought into the\nhall; and whiles one or two of them come in hither with empty hands for\na sleep and a bellyful; and again a captive led in on the road to the\nmarket.  Forsooth it is now a good few days ago three of them brought\nin a woman as goodly as mine eyes have ever seen; and she sat on the\nbench yonder, and seemed to heed little that she was a captive and had\nshackles on her feet after the custom of these men, though indeed her\nhands were unbound, so that she might eat her meat; and the carle thief\ntold me that he took her but a little way from the garth, and that she\nmade a stout defence with a sword before they might take her, but being\ntaken, she made but little of it.\"\n\n\"Would he do her any hurt?\" said Ralph.  \"Nay, surely,\" said the carle;\n\"doth a man make a hole in a piece of cloth which he is taking to\nmarket?  Nay, he was courteous to her after his fashion, and bade us\ngive her the best of all we had.\"\n\n\"What like was she?\" said Ralph.  Said the carle: \"She was somewhat\ntall, if I am to note such matters, grey-eyed and brown haired, and\ngreat abundance of it.  Her lips very red; her cheeks tanned with the\nsun, but in such wise that her own white and red shone through the\nsun's painting, so that her face was as sweet as the best wheat-ear in\na ten-acre field when the season hath been good.  Her hands were not\nlike those of a demoiselle who sitteth in a chamber to be looked at,\nbut brown as of one who hath borne the sickle in the sun.  But when she\nstretched out her hand so that the wrist of her came forth from her\nsleeve it was as white as milk.\"\n\n\"Well, my man,\" said the carline, \"thou hast a good memory for an old\nand outworn carle.  Why dost thou not tell the young knight what she\nwas clad withal; since save for their raiment all women of an age are\nmuch alike?\"\n\n\"Nay, do thou do it,\" said the carle; \"she was even as fair as I have\nsaid; so that there be few like her.\"\n\nSaid the dame:  \"Well, there is naught so much to be said for her\nraiment: her gown was green, of fine cloth enough; but not very new:\nwelts of needle-work it had on it, and a wreath of needle-work flowers\nround the hem of the skirt; but a cantle was torn off from it; in the\nscuffle when she was taken, I suppose, so that it was somewhat ragged\nin one place.  Furthermore--\"\n\nShe had been looking at Ralph as she spoke, and now she broke off\nsuddenly, and said, still looking at him hard; \"Well, it is strange!\"\n\"What is strange?\" said Clement.  \"O naught, naught,\" said the dame,\n\"save that folk should make so much to do about this matter, when there\nare so many coming and going about the Midhouse of the Mountains.\"\n\nBut Ralph noted that she was still staring at him even after she had\nlet the talk drop.\n\nWaned the even, and folk began to go bedward, so that the hall grew\nthin of guests.  Then came up the carline to Ralph and took him aside\ninto a nook, and said to him:  \"Young knight, now will I tell thee what\nseemed to me strange e'en now; to wit, that the captive damsel should\nbe bearing a necklace about her neck as like to thine as one lamb is to\nanother: but I thought thou mightest be liever that I spake it not\nopenly before all the other folk.  So I held my peace.\"\n\n\"Dame,\" said he, \"I thank thee:  forsooth I fear sorely that this\ndamsel is my sister; for ever we have worn the samelike pair of beads.\nAnd as for me I have come hither to find her, and evil will it be if I\nfind her enthralled, and it may be past redemption.\"\n\nAnd therewith he gave her a piece of the gold money of Upmeads.\n\n\"Yea,\" said she, \"poor youth; that will be sooth indeed, for thou art\nsomewhat like unto her, yet far goodlier.  But I grieve for thee, and\nknow not what thou wilt do; whereas by this time most like she has been\nsold and bought and is dwelling in some lord's strong-house; some\ntyrant that needeth not money, and will not let his prey go for a\nprayer.  Here, take thou thy gold again, for thou mayst well need it,\nand let me shear a lock of thy golden hair, and I shall be well apaid\nfor my keeping silence concerning thy love.  For I deem that it is even\nso, and that she is not thy sister, else hadst thou stayed at home, and\nprayed for her with book and priest and altar, and not gone seeking her\na weary way.\"\n\nRalph reddened but said naught, and let her put scizzors amongst his\ncurly locks, and take what of them she would.  And then he went to his\nbed, and pondered these matters somewhat, and said to himself that it\nwas by this damsel's means that he should find the Well at the World's\nEnd.  Yet he said also, that, whether it were so or not, he was bound\nto seek her, and deliver her from thralldom, since he had kissed her so\nsweet and friendly, like a brother, for the sweetness and kindness of\nher, before he had fallen into the love that had brought him such joy\nand such grief.  And therewith he took out that piece of her gown from\nhis pouch, and it seemed dear to him.  But it made him think sadly of\nwhat grief or pain she might even then be bearing, so that he longed to\ndeliver her, and that longing was sweet to him.  In such thoughts he\nfell asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nA Battle in the Mountains\n\n\nWhen it was morning they arose early and ate a morsel; and Clement gave\nfreely to the Warden and his helpmate on behalf of the fellowship; and\nthen they saddled their nags, and did on the loads and departed; and\nthe way was evil otherwise, but it was down hill, and all waters ran\neast.\n\nAll day they rode, and at even when the sun had not quite set, they\npitched their camp at the foot of a round knoll amidst a valley where\nwas water and grass; and looking down thence, they had a sight of the\nfruitful plain, wherein lay Cheaping Knowe all goodly blue in the\ndistance.\n\nThis was a fair place and a lovely, and great ease would they have had\nthere, were it not that they must keep watch and ward with more pains\nthan theretofore; for Clement deemed it as good as certain that the\nwild men would fall upon them that night.\n\nBut all was peaceful the night through, and in the morning they gat to\nthe way speedily, riding with their armour on, and their bows bent: and\nthree of the men-at-arms rode ahead to espy the way.\n\nSo it befell that they had not ridden two hours ere back came the\nfore-riders with the tidings that the pass next below them was thick\nwith the Strong-thieves.\n\nThe fellowship were as then in such a place, that they were riding a\nhigh bare ridge, and could not be assailed to the advantage of the\nthieves if they abode where they were; whereas if they went forward,\nthey must needs go down with the road into the dale that was beset by\nthe wild men.  Now they were three-score and two all told, but of these\nbut a score of men-at-arms besides Ralph, and Clement, who was a stout\nfighter when need was.  Of the others, some were but lads, and of the\nChapmen were three old men, and more than one blencher besides.\nHowever, all men were armed, and they had many bows, and some of the\nchapmen's knaves were fell archers.\n\nSo they took counsel together, and to some it seemed better to abide\nthe onset on their vantage ground.  But to Clement and the older\nmen-at-arms this seemed of no avail.  For though they could see the\nplain country down below, they would have no succour of it; and Clement\nbade them think how the night would come at last, and that the longer\nthey abode, the greater would be the gathering of the Strong-thieves;\nso that, all things considered, it were better to fall on at once and\nto try the adventure of the valley.  And this after some talk they\nyea-said all, save a few who held their skins so dear that their wits\nwandered somewhat.\n\nSo these timorous ones they bade guard the sumpter beasts and their\nloads; and even so they did, and abode a little, while the men-at-arms\nand the bowmen went forward without more ado; and Ralph rode betwixt\nClement and the captain of the men-at-arms.\n\nPresently they were come close to the place where the way went down\ninto the valley, cleaving through a clayey bent, so that the slippery\nsides of the cleft went up high to right and left; wherefore by goodhap\nthere were no big stones anigh to roll down upon them.  Moreover the\nway was short, and they rode six abreast down the pass and were soon\nthrough the hollow way.  As he rode Ralph saw a few of the\nStrong-thieves at the nether end where the pass widened out, and they\nlet fly some arrows at the chapmen which did no hurt, though some of\nthe shafts rattled on the armour of the companions.  But when Clement\nsaw that folk, and heard the noise of their shouting he lifted up a\ngreat axe that he bore and cried, \"St. Agnes for the Mercers!\" and set\nspurs to his horse.  So did they all, and came clattering and shouting\ndown the steep road like a stone out of a sling, and drave right into\nthe valley one and all, the would-be laggards following after; for they\nwere afraid to be left behind.\n\nThe wild men, who, save for wide shields which they bore, were but\nevilly armed, mostly in skins of beasts, made no countenance of\ndefence, but fled all they might towards the steep slopes of the\nvalley, and then turned and fell to shooting; for the companions durst\nnot pursue in haste lest they should be scattered, and overwhelmed by\nthe multitude of foemen; but they drew up along the south side of the\nvalley, and had the mastery of the road, so that this first bout was\nwithout blood-shedding. Albeit the thieves still shot in their weak\nbows from the hill-side, but scarce hurt a man.  Then the bowmen of the\nfellowship fell to shooting at the wild men, while the men-at-arms\nbreathed their horses, and the sumpter-beasts were gathered together\nbehind them; for they had no dread of abiding there a while, whereas\nbehind them the ground was broken into a steep shaly cliff, bushed here\nand there with tough bushes, so that no man could come up it save by\nclimbing with hand and knee, and that not easily.\n\nNow when the archers had shot a good while, and some of the thieves had\nfallen before them, and men were in good heart because of the flight of\nthe wild men, Ralph, seeing that these still hung about the slopes,\ncried out: \"Master Clement, and thou Captain, sure it will be ill-done\nto leave these men unbroken behind us, lest they follow us and hang\nabout our hindermost, slaying us both men and horses.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" quoth the captain, who was a man of few words, \"let us go.\nBut do thou, Clement, abide by the stuff with the lads and bowmen.\"\n\nThen he cried out aloud:  \"St. Christopher to aid!\" and shook his rein,\nand all they who were clad in armour and well mounted spurred on with\nhim against the strong-thieves. But these, when they saw the onset of\nthe horsemen, but drew a little up the hill-side and stood fast, and\nsome of the horses were hurt by their shot.  So the captain bade draw\nrein and off horse, while Clement led his bowmen nigher, and they shot\nwell together, and hindered the thieves from closing round the\nmen-at-arms, or falling on the horses.  So then the companions went\nforward stoutly on foot, and entered into the battle of the thieves,\nand there was the thrusting and the hewing great:  for the foemen bore\naxes, and malls, and spears, and were little afraid, having the\nvantage-ground; and they were lithe and strong men, though not tall.\n\nRalph played manfully, and was hurt by a spear above the knee, but not\ngrievously; so he heeded it not, but cleared a space all about him with\ngreat strokes of the Upmeads' blade; then as the wild men gave back\nthere was one of them who stood his ground and let drive a stroke of a\nlong-handled hammer at him, but Ralph ran in under the stroke and\ncaught him by the throat and drew him out of the press.  And even\ntherewith the wild men broke up before the onset of the all-armed\ncarles, and fled up the hill, and the men-at-arms followed them but a\nlittle, for their armour made them unspeedy; so that they took no more\nof those men, though they slew some, but turned about and gathered\nround Ralph and made merry over his catch, for they were joyous with\nthe happy end of battle; and Clement, who had left his bowmen when the\nCompanions were mingled with the wild-men, was there amidst the nighest.\n\nSaid Ralph to him:  \"Well, have I got me a servant and thrall good\ncheap?\" \"Yea,\" said Clement, \"if thou deem a polecat a likely hound.\"\nSaid the Captain:  \"Put thy sword through him, knight.\"  Quoth another:\n\"Let him run up hill, and our bowmen shall shoot a match at him.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"they have done well with their shooting, let them\nrest.  As to my thrusting my sword through the man, Captain, I had done\nthat before, had I been so minded.  At any rate, I will ask him if he\nwill serve me truly.  Otherwise he seemeth a strong carle and a handy.\nHow sayest thou, lad, did I take thee fairly?\"  \"Yea,\" said the man,\n\"thou art a strong lad.\"\n\nHe seemed to fear the swords about him but little, and forsooth he was\na warrior-like man, and not ill-looking. He was of middle height,\nstrong and well-knit, with black hair like a beast's mane for\nshagginess, and bright blue eyes.  He was clad in a short coat of grey\nhomespun, with an ox-skin habergeon laced up over it; he had neither\nhelm nor hat, nor shoes, but hosen made of a woollen clout tied about\nhis legs; his shield of wood and ox-hide lay on the ground a few paces\noff, and his hammer beside it, which he had dropped when Ralph first\nhandled him, but a great ugly knife was still girt to him.\n\nNow Ralph saith to him:  \"Which wilt thou--be slain, or serve me?\" Said\nthe carle, grinning, yet not foully:  \"Guess if I would not rather\nserve thee!\"  \"Wilt thou serve me truly?\" said Ralph.  \"Why not?\" quoth\nthe carle:  \"yet I warn thee that if thou beat me, save in hot blood, I\nshall put a knife into thee when I may.\"\n\n\"O,\" said one, \"thrust him through now at once, lord Ralph.\" \"Nay, I\nwill not,\" said Ralph; \"he hath warned me fairly.  Maybe he will serve\nme truly.  Master Clement, wilt thou lend me a horse for my man to\nride?\"  \"Yea,\" said Clement; \"yet I misdoubt me of thy new squire.\"\nThen he turned to the men-at-arms and said:  \"No tarrying, my masters!\nTo horse and away before they gather gain!\"\n\nSo they mounted and rode away from that valley of the pass, and Ralph\nmade his man ride beside him.  But the man said to him, as soon as they\nwere riding:  \"Take note that I will not fight against my kindred.\"\n\"None biddeth thee so,\" said Ralph; \"but do thou take heed that if thou\nfight against us I will slay thee outright.\"  Said the man: \"A fair\nbargain!\"  \"Well,\" said Ralph, \"I will have thy knife of thee, lest it\ntempt thee, as is the wont of cold iron, and a maiden's body.\" \"Nay,\nmaster,\" quoth the man, \"leave me my knife, as thou art a good fellow.\nIn two hours time we shall be past all peril of my people, and when we\ncome down below I will slay thee as many as thou wilt, so it be out of\nthe kindred.  Forsooth down there evil they be, and unkinsome.\"\n\n\"So be it, lad,\" said Ralph, laughing, \"keep thy knife; but hang this\nword of mine thereon, that if thou slay any man of this fellowship save\nme, I will rather flay thee alive than slay thee.\" Quoth the carle:\n\"That is the bargain, then, and I yeasay it.\" \"Good,\" said Ralph; \"now\ntell me thy name.\"  \"Bull Shockhead,\" said the carle.\n\nBut now the fellowship took to riding so fast down the slopes of the\nmountains on a far better road, that talking together was not easy.\nThey kept good watch, both behind and ahead, nor were they set upon\nagain, though whiles they saw clumps of men on the hill-sides.\n\nSo after a while, when it was a little past noon, they came adown to\nthe lower slopes of the mountains and the foot-hills, which were green\nand unstony; and thereon were to be seen cattle and neatherds and\nshepherds, and here and there the garth of a homestead, and fenced\nacres about it.\n\nSo now that they were come down into the peopled parts, they displayed\nthe banners of their fellowships, to wit, the Agnes, the White Fleece,\nthe Christopher, and the Ship and Nicholas, which last was the banner\nof the Faring-knights of Whitwall; but Ralph was glad to ride under the\nbanner of St. Nicholas, his friend, and deemed that luck might the\nrather come to him thereby.  But they displayed their banners now,\nbecause they knew that no man of the peopled parts would be so hardy as\nto fall upon the Chapmen, of whom they looked to have many matters for\ntheir use and pleasure.\n\nSo now that they felt themselves safe, they stayed them, and sat down\nby a fair little stream, and ate their dinner of such meat and drink as\nthey had; and Ralph departed his share with his thrall, and the man was\nhungry and ate well; so that Clement said mockingly: \"Thou feedest thy\nthrall over well, lord, even for a king's son: is it so that thou art\nminded to fatten him and eat him?\" Then some of the others took up the\njest, and bade the carle refrain him of the meat, so that he might not\nfatten, and might live the longer.  He hearkened to them, and knit his\nbrows and looked fiercely from one to the other.  But Ralph laughed\naloud, and shook his finger at him and refrained him, and his wrath ran\noff him and he laughed, and shoved the victual into him doughtily, and\nsighed for pleasure when he had made an end and drunk a draught of wine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nRalph Talks With Bull Shockhead\n\n\nWhen they rode on again, Ralph rode beside Bull, who was merry and\nblithe now he was full of meat and drink; and he spake anon:  \"So thou\nart a king's son, master?  I deemed from the first that thou wert of\nlineage.  For as for these churls of chapmen, and the sworders whom\nthey wage, they know not the name of their mother's mother, nor have\nheard one word of the beginner of their kindred; and their deeds are\nlike unto their kinlessness.\"\n\n\"And are thy deeds so good?\" said Ralph.  \"Are they ill,\" said Bull,\n\"when they are done against the foemen?\"  Said Ralph: \"And are all men\nyour foemen who pass through these mountains?\" \"All,\" said Bull, \"but\nthey be of the kindred or their known friends.\"\n\n\"Well, Bull,\" said Ralph, \"I like thy deeds little, that thou shouldest\nravish men and women from their good life, and sell them for a price\ninto toil and weariness and stripes.\"\n\nSaid Bull:  \"How much worse do we than the chapmen by his debtor, and\nthe lord of the manor by his villein?\"  Said Ralph: \"Far worse, if ye\ndid but know it, poor men!\"  Quoth Bull: \"But I neither know it, nor\ncan know it, nay, not when thou sayest it; for it is not so.  And look\nyou, master, this life of a bought thrall is not such an exceeding evil\nlife; for oft they be dealt with softly and friendly, and have other\nthralls to work for them under their whips.\"\n\nRalph laughed:  \"Which shall I make thee, friend Bull, the upper or the\nunder?\"  Bull reddened, but said naught.  Said Ralph: \"Or where shall I\nsell thee, that I may make the best penny out of my good luck and\nvaliancy?\"  Bull looked chopfallen: \"Nay,\" said he in a wheedling\nvoice, \"thou wilt not sell me, thou?  For I deem that thou wilt be a\ngood master to me:  and,\" he broke into sudden heat hereat, \"if I have\nanother master I shall surely slay him whate'er betide.\"\n\nRalph laughed again, and said:  \"Seest thou what an evil craft ye\nfollow, when thou deemest it better to be slain with bitter torments\n(as thou shouldest be if thou slewest thy master) than to be sold to\nany master save one exceeding good?\"\n\nBull held his peace hereat, but presently he said: \"Well, be our craft\ngood or evil, it is gainful; and whiles there is prey taken right good,\nwhich, for my part, I would not sell, once I had my hand thereon.\"\n\"Yea, women?\" said Ralph.  \"Even so,\" said Bull, \"such an one was taken\nby my kinsman Bull Nosy but a little while agone, whom he took down to\nthe market at Cheaping Knowe, as I had not done if I had once my arms\nabout her.  For she was as fair as a flower; and yet so well built,\nthat she could bear as much as a strong man in some ways; and, saith\nNosy, when she was taken, there was no weeping or screeching in her,\nbut patience rather and quietness, and intent to bear all and\nlive....Master, may I ask thee a question?\"  \"Ask on,\" said Ralph.\nSaid Bull:  \"The pair of beads about thy neck, whence came they?\" \"They\nwere the gift of a dear friend,\" said Ralph.  \"A woman?\" quoth Bull.\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Now is this strange,\" said Bull, \"and I wot not what it may betoken,\nbut this same woman had about her neck a pair of beads as like to thine\nas if they had been the very same:  did this woman give thee the beads?\nFor I will say this of thee, master, that thou art well nigh as likely\na man as she is a woman.\"\n\nRalph sighed, for this talk of the woman and the beads brought all the\nstory into his mind, so that it was as if he saw it adoing again: the\nLady of the Wildwood led along to death before he delivered her, and\ntheir flight together from the Water of the Oak, and that murder of her\nin the desert.  And betwixt the diverse deeds of the day this had of\nlate become somewhat dim to him.  Yet after his grief came joy that\nthis man also had seen the damsel, whom his dream of the night had\ncalled Dorothea, and that he knew of her captors; wherefore by his\nmeans he might come on her and deliver her.\n\nNow he spake aloud:  \"Nay, it was not she that gave them to me, but yet\nwere I fain to find this woman that thou sawest; for I look to meet a\nfriend whenas I meet her.  So tell me, dost thou think that I may\ncheapen her of thy kinsman?\"\n\nBull shook his head, and said:  \"It may be:  or it may be that he hath\nalready sold her to one who heedeth not treasure so much as fair flesh;\nand fair is hers beyond most.  But, lord, I will do my best to find her\nfor thee; as thou art a king's son and no ill master, I deem.\"\n\n\"Do that,\" quoth Ralph, \"and I in turn will do what more I may for thee\nbesides making thee free.\"  And therewith he rode forward that he might\nget out of earshot, for Bull's tongue seemed like to be long.  And\npresently he heard laughter behind him, as the carle began jesting and\ntalking with the chapman lads.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nOf the Town of Cheaping Knowe\n\n\nNow when it was evening they pitched their camp down in the plain\nfields amidst tall elmtrees, and had their banners still flying over\nthe tents to warn all comers of what they were.  But the next morning\nthe chapmen and their folk were up betimes to rummage their loads, and\nto array their wares for the market; and they gat not to the road\nbefore mid-morning. Meantime of their riding Ralph had more talk with\nBull, who said to him: \"Fair lord, I rede thee when thou art in the\nmarket of Cheaping Knowe, bid master Clement bring thee to the\nthrall-merchant, and trust me that if such a fair image as that we were\nspeaking of hath passed through his hands within these three months, he\nwill remember it; and then thou shalt have at least some tale of what\nhath befallen her but a little while ago.\"\n\nThat seemed good rede to Ralph, and when they went on their way he rode\nbeside Clement, and asked him many things concerning Cheaping Knowe;\nand at last about the thrall-market therein.  And Clement said that,\nthough he dealt not in such wares, he had often seen them sold, and\nknew the master of that market.  And when Ralph asked if the said\nmaster would answer questions concerning the selling of men and of\nwomen, Clement smiled and said: \"Yea, yea, he will answer; for as he\nlives by selling thralls, and every time a thrall is sold by him he\nmaketh some gain by it, it is to his profit that they change masters as\noften as may be; and when thou askest of the woman whom thou art\nseeking, he will be deeming that there will be some new chaffer ahead.\nI will bring thee to him, and thou shalt ask him of what thou wilt, and\nbelike he will tell thee quietly over the wine-cup.\"\n\nTherewith was Ralph well content, and he grew eager to enter into the\ntown.\n\nThey came to the gates a little before sunset, after they had passed\nthrough much fair country; but nigh to the walls it was bare of trees\nand thickets, whereas, said Clement, they had been cut down lest they\nshould serve as cover to strong-thieves or folk assailing the town.\nThe walls were strong and tall, and a great castle stood high up on a\nhill, about which the town was builded; so that if the town were taken\nthere would yet be another town within it to be taken also.  But the\ntown within, save for the said castle, was scarce so fairly builded as\nthe worst of the towns which Ralph had seen erst, though there were a\nmany houses therein.\n\nMuch people was gathered about the gate to see the merchants enter with\nbanners displayed; and Ralph deemed many of the folk fair, such as were\ngoodly clad; for many had but foul clouts to cover their nakedness, and\nseemed needy and hunger-pinched. Withal there were many warriors\namongst the throng, and most of these bore a token on their sleeves, to\nwit, a sword reddened with blood.  And Clement, speaking softly in\nRalph's ear, did him to wit that this was the token of the lord who had\ngotten the castle in those days, and was tyrant of the town; and how\nthat he had so many men-at-arms ready to do his bidding that none in\nthe town was safe from him if he deemed it more for his pleasure and\nprofit to rob or maim, or torment or slay, than to suffer them to live\npeaceably.  \"But with us chapmen,\" said Clement, \"he will not meddle,\nlest there be an end of chaffer in the town; and verily the market is\ngood.\"\n\nThus they rode through the streets into the market place, which was\nwide and great, and the best houses of the town were therein, and so\ncame to the hostel of the Merchants, called the Fleece, which was a big\nhouse, and goodly enough.\n\nThe next morning Clement and the other chapmen went up into the Castle,\nbearing with them gifts out of their wares for the lord, and Clement\nbade Ralph keep close till he came back, and especially to keep his\nwar-caught thrall, Bull Shockhead, safe at home, lest he be taken from\nhim, and to clothe him in the guise of the chapman lads, and to dock\nhis hair; and even so Ralph did, though Bull were loath thereto.\n\nAbout noon the chapmen came back again well pleased; and Clement gave\nRalph a parchment from the lord, which bade all men help and let pass\nRalph of Upmeads, as a sergeant of the chapmen's guard, and said withal\nthat now he was free to go about the town if he listed, so that he were\nback at the hostel of the Fleece by nightfall.\n\nSo Ralph went in company with some of the sergeants and others, and\nlooked at this and that about the town without hindrance, save that the\nguard would not suffer them to pass further than the bailey of the\nCastle.  And for the said bailey, forsooth, they had but little\nstomach; for they saw thence, on the slopes of the Castle-hill, tokens\nof the cruel justice of the said lord; for there were men and women\nthere, yea, and babes also, hanging on gibbets and thrust through with\nsharp pales, and when they asked of folk why these had suffered, they\nbut looked at them as if astonished, and passed on without a word.\n\nSo they went thence, and found the master-church, and deemed it not\nmuch fairer than it was great; and it was nowise great, albeit it was\nstrange and uncouth of fashion.\n\nThen they came to great gardens within the town, and they were\nexceeding goodly, and had trees and flowers and fruits in them which\nRalph had not seen hitherto, as lemons, and oranges, and pomegranates;\nand the waters were running through them in runnels of ashlar; and the\nweather was fair and hot; so they rested in those gardens till it was\nevening, and then gat them home to Fleece, where they had good\nentertainment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\nRalph Heareth More Tidings of the Damsel\n\n\nThe second day, while the merchants saw to their chaffer, most of the\nmen-at-arms, and Ralph with them, spent their time again in those\ngoodly gardens; where, indeed, some of them made friends of fair women\nof the place; in which there was less risk than had been for aliens in\nsome towns, whereas at Cheaping Knowe such women as were wedded\naccording to law, or damsels in the care of their kindred, or slaves\nwho were concubines, had not dared so much as to look on a man.\n\nThe third day time hung somewhat heavy on Ralph's hands, not but that\nthe Companions were well at ease, but rather because himseemed that he\nwas not stirring in the quest.\n\nBut the next day Clement bade him come see that thrall-merchant\naforesaid, and brought him to a corner of the market-place, where was a\nthrong looking on at the cheaping.  They went through the throng, and\nbeside a stone like a leaping-on stone saw a tall man, goodly of\npresence, black bearded, clad in scarlet; and this was the merchant;\nand by him were two of his knaves and certain weaponed men who had\nbrought their wares to the cheaping.  And some of these were arrayed\nlike those foemen of the mountains.  There was a half score and three\nof these chattels to be sold, who stood up one after other on the\nstone, that folk might cheapen them.  The cheaping was long about,\nbecause they that had a mind to buy were careful to know what they were\nbuying, like as if they had been cheapening a horse, and most of them\nbefore they bid their highest had the chattels away into the merchant's\nbooth to strip them, lest they should buy damaged or unhandsome bodies;\nand this more especially if it were a woman, for the men were already\nwell nigh naked.  Of women four of them were young and goodly, and\nRalph looked at them closely; but they were naught like to the woman of\nhis quest.\n\nNow this cheaping irked Ralph sorely, as was like to be, whereas, as\nhath been told, he came from a land where were no thralls, none but\nvavassors and good yeomen:  yet he abode till all was done, hansel\npaid, and the thralls led off by their new masters.  Then Clement led\nhim up to the merchant, to whom he gave the sele of the day, and said:\n\"Master, this is the young knight of whom I told thee, who deemeth that\na woman who is his friend hath been brought to this market and sold\nthere, and if he might, he would ransom her.\"\n\nThe merchant greeted Ralph courteously, and bade him and Clement come\ninto his house, where they might speak more privily.  So did they, and\nhe treated them with honour, and set wine and spices before them, and\nbade Ralph say whatlike the woman was.  Ralph did so, and wondered at\nhimself how well and closely he could tell of her, like as a picture\npainted.  And, moreover, he drew forth that piece of her gown which he\nhad come on by the Mid-Mountain House.\n\nSo when he had done, the merchant, who was a man sober of aspect and\nsomewhat slow of speech, said:  \"Sir, I believe surely that I have seen\nthis damsel, but she is not with me now, nor have I sold her ever; but\nhither was she brought to be sold by a man of the mountain folk not\nvery many days ago.  And the man's name was Bull Nosy, or the longnosed\nman of the kindred of the Bull, for in such wise are named the men of\nthat unhappy folk.  Now this was the cause why I might not sell her,\nthat she was so proud and stout that men feared her, what she might do\nif they had her away.  And when some spake to see her body naked, she\ndenied it utterly, saying that she would do a mischief to whomsoever\ntried it.  So I spake to him who owned her, and asked him if he thought\nit good to take her a while and quell her with such pains as would\nspoil her but little, and then bring her to market when she was meeker.\nBut he heeded my words little, and led her away, she riding on a horse\nand he going afoot beside her; for the mountain-men be no horsemen.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Dost thou know at all whither he will have led her?\" Said\nthe merchant:  \"By my deeming, he will have gone first of all to the\ntown of Whiteness, whither thy Fellowship will betake them ere long:\nfor he will be minded to meet there the Lord of Utterbol, who is for\nsuch like wares; and he will either give her to him as a gift, for\nwhich he will have a gift in return, or he will sell her to my lord at\na price if he dare to chaffer with him.  At least so will he do if he\nbe wise.  Now if the said lord hath her, it will be somewhat more than\nhard for thee to get her again, till he have altogether done with her;\nfor money and goods are naught to him beside the doing of his will.\nBut there is this for thy comfort, that whereas she is so fair a woman,\nshe will be well with my lord.  For I warrant me that she will not dare\nto be proud with him, as she was with the folk here.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and what is this lord of Utterbol that all folk,\nmen and women, fear him so?\"  Said the merchant: \"Fair sir, thou must\npardon me if I say no more of him.  Belike thou mayst fall in with him;\nand if thou dost, take heed that thou make not thyself great with him.\"\n\nSo Ralph thanked the merchant and departed with Clement, of whom\npresently he asked if he knew aught of this lord of Utterbol.  Said\nClement: \"God forbid that I should ever meet him, save where I were\nmany and he few.  I have never seen him; but he is deemed by all men as\nthe worst of the tyrants who vex these lands, and, maybe, the\nmightiest.\"\n\nSo was Ralph sore at heart for the damsel, and anon he spake to Bull\nagain of her, who deemed somewhat, that his kinsman had been minded at\nthe first to sell her to the lord of Utterbol.  And Ralph thinks his\ngame a hard one, yet deems that if he could but find out where the\ndamsel was, he might deliver her, what by sleight, what by boldness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\nThe Fellowship Comes to Whiteness\n\n\nTwo days thereafter the chapmen having done with their matters in\nCheaping Knowe, whereas they must needs keep some of their wares for\nother places, and especially for Goldburg, they dight them to be gone\nand rode out a-gates of a mid-morning with banners displayed.\n\nIt was some fifty miles thence to Whiteness, which lay close underneath\nthe mountains, and was, as it were, the door of the passes whereby men\nrode to Goldburg.  The land which they passed through was fair, both of\ntillage and pasture, with much cattle therein.  Everywhere they saw men\nand women working afield, but no houses of worthy yeomen or vavassors,\nor cots of good husbandmen.  Here and there was a castle or\nstrong-house, and here and there long rows of ugly hovels, or whiles\nhouses, big tall and long, but exceeding foul and ill-favoured, such as\nRalph had not yet seen the like of.  And when he asked of Clement\nconcerning all this, he said:  \"It is as I have told thee, that here be\nno freemen who work afield, nay, nor villeins either.  All those whom\nye have seen working have been bought and sold like to those whom we\nsaw standing on the Stone in the market of Cheaping Knowe, or else were\nborn of such cattle, and each one of them can be bought and sold again,\nand they work not save under the whip.  And as for those hovels and the\nlong and foul houses, they are the stables wherein this kind of cattle\nis harboured.\"\n\nThen Ralph's heart sank, and he said:  \"Master Clement, I prithee tell\nme; were it possible that the damsel whom I seek may be come to such a\npass as one of these?\" \"Nay,\" quoth Clement, \"that is little like to\nbe; such goodly wares are kept for the adornment of great men's houses.\nTrue it is that whiles the house-thralls be sent into the fields for\ntheir punishment; yet not such as she, unless the master be wholly\nwearied of them, or if their wrath outrun their wits; for it is more to\nthe master's profit to chastise them at home; so keep a good heart I\nbid thee, and maybe we shall have tidings at Whiteness.\"\n\nSo Ralph refrained his anxious heart, though forsooth his thought was\nmuch upon the damsel and of how she was faring.\n\nIt was not till the third day at sunset that they came to Whiteness;\nfor on the last day of their riding they came amongst the confused\nhills that lay before the great mountains, which were now often hidden\nfrom their sight; but whenever they appeared through the openings of\nthe near hills, they seemed very great and terrible; dark and bare and\nstony; and Clement said that they were little better than they looked\nfrom afar.  As to Whiteness, they saw it a long way off, as it lay on a\nlong ridge at the end of a valley: and so long was the ridge, that\nbehind it was nothing green; naught but the huge and bare mountains.\nThe westering sun fell upon its walls and its houses, so that it looked\nwhite indeed against those great cliffs and crags; though, said\nClement, that these were yet a good way off.  Now when, after a long\nride from the hither end of the valley, they drew nigh to the town,\nRalph saw that the walls and towers were not very high or strong, for\nso steep was the hill whereon the town stood, that it needed not.  Here\nalso was no great castle within the town as at Cheaping Knowe, and the\ntown itself nothing so big, but long and straggling along the top of\nthe ridge.  Cheaping Knowe was all builded of stone; but the houses\nhere were of timber for the most part, done over with pargeting and\nwhitened well.  Yet was the town more cheerful of aspect than Cheaping\nKnowe, and the folk who came thronging about the chapmen at the gates\nnot so woe-begone, and goodly enough.\n\nOf the lord of Whiteness, Clement told that he paid tribute to him of\nCheaping Knowe, rather for love of peace than for fear of him; for he\nwas no ill lord, and free men lived well under him.\n\nSo the chapmen lodged in the market-place; and in two days time Ralph\ngot speech of the Deacon of the Chapmen of the Town; who told him two\nmatters; first that the lord of Utterbol had not been in Whiteness\nthese six months; and next that the wild man had verily brought the\ndamsel into the market; but he had turned away thence suddenly with\nher, without bringing her to the stone, and that it was most like that\nhe would have the lord of Utterbol buy her; who, since he would be\ndeeming that he might easily bend her to his will, would give him the\nbetter penny for her.  \"At the last,\" quoth the Deacon, \"the wild man\nled her away toward the mountain pass that goeth to Goldburg, the\ndamsel and he alone, and she with her hands unbound and riding a little\nhorse.\" Of these tidings Ralph deemed it good that all traces of her\nwere not lost; but his heart misgave him when he thought that by this\ntime she must surely be in the hands of the lord of Utterbol.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\nThey Ride the Mountains Toward Goldburg\n\n\nFive days the Fellowship abode at Whiteness, and or ever they departed\nClement waged men-at-arms of the lord of the town, besides servants to\nlook to the beasts amongst the mountains, so that what with one, what\nwith another, they entered the gates of the mountains a goodly company\nof four score and ten.\n\nRalph asked of Bull if any of those whom he might meet in these\nmountains were of his kindred; and he answered, nay, unless perchance\nthere might be some one or two going their peaceful errands there like\nBull Nosy.  So Ralph armed him with a good sword and a shield, and\nwould have given him a steel hood also, but he would not bear it,\nsaying that if sword and shield could not keep his head he had well\nearned a split skull.\n\nSeven days they rode the mountains, and the way was toilsome and weary\nenough, for it was naught but a stony maze of the rocks where nothing\nliving dwelt, and nothing grew, save now and again a little dwarf\nwillow.  Yet was there naught worse to meet save toil, because they\nwere over strong for the wild men to meddle with them, whereas the\nkindreds thereabout were but feeble.\n\nBut as it drew towards evening on the seventh day Ralph had ridden a\nlittle ahead with Bull alone, if he might perchance have a sight of the\nending of this grievous wilderness, as Clement said might be, since now\nthe way was down-hill, and all waters ran east.  So as they rode, and\nit was about sunset, they saw something lying by a big stone under a\ncliff; so they drew nigh, and saw a man lying on his back, and they\ndeemed he was dead.  So Bull went up to him, and leapt off his horse\nclose by him and bent over him, but straightway cast up his arms and\nset up a long wailing whoop, and then another and another, so that they\nthat were behind heard it and came up upon the spur.  But Ralph leapt\nfrom his horse, and ran up to Bull and said: \"What aileth thee to whoop\nand wail?  Who is it?\"  But Bull turned about and shook his head at\nhim, and said:  \"It is a man of my kindred, even he that was leading\naway thy she-friend; and belike she it was that slew him, or why is she\nnot here: Ochone! ahoo! ahoo!\"  Therewith fire ran through Ralph's\nheart, and he bethought him of that other murder in the wilderness, and\nhe fell to wringing his hands, and cried out:  \"Ah, and where is she,\nwhere is she?  Is she also taken away from me for ever?  O me unhappy!\"\n\nAnd he drew his sword therewith, and ran about amongst the rocks and\nthe bushes seeking her body.\n\nAnd therewith came up Clement, and others of the company, and wondered\nto see Bull kneeling down by the corpse, and to hear him crying out and\nwailing, and Ralph running about like one mad, and crying out now: \"Oh!\nthat I might find her!  Mayhappen she is alive yet, and anigh here in\nsome cleft of the rocks in this miserable wilderness.  O my love that\nhast lain in mine arms, wouldst thou not have me find her alive?  But\nif she be dead, then will I slay myself, for as young as I am, that I\nmay find thee and her out of the world, since from the world both ye\nare gone.\"\n\nThen Clement went up to Ralph, and would have a true tale out of him,\nand asked him what was amiss; but Ralph stared wild at him and answered\nnot.  But Bull cried out from where he knelt:  \"He is seeking the\nwoman, and I would that he could find her; for then would I slay her on\nthe howe of my kinsman: for she hath slain him; she hath slain him.\"\n\nThat word heard Ralph, and he ran at Bull with uplifted sword to slay\nhim; but Clement tripped him and he fell, and his sword flew out of his\nhand.  Then Clement and two of the others bound his hands with their\ngirdles, till they might know what had befallen; for they deemed that a\ndevil had entered into him, and feared that he would do a mischief to\nhimself or some other.\n\nAnd now was the whole Fellowship assembled, and stood in a ring round\nabout Ralph and Bull, and the dead man; as for him, he had been dead\nsome time, many days belike; but in that high and clear cold air, his\ncarcase, whistled by the wind, had dried rather than rotted, and his\nface was clear to be seen with its great hooked nose and long black\nhair: and his skull was cloven.\n\nNow Bull had done his wailing for his kinsman, and he seemed to wake up\nas from a dream, and looked about the ring of men and spake:  \"Here is\na great to do, my masters!  What will ye with me?  Have ye heard, or is\nit your custom, that when a man cometh on the dead corpse of his\nbrother, his own mother's son, he turneth it over with his foot, as if\nit were the carcase of a dog, and so goeth on his way?  This I ask,\nthat albeit I be but a war-taken thrall, I be suffered to lay my\nbrother in earth and heap a howe over him in these mountains.\"\n\nThey all murmured a yeasay to this save Ralph.  He had been sobered by\nhis fall, and was standing up now betwixt Clement and the captain, who\nhad unbound his hands, now that the others had come up; he hung his\nhead, and was ashamed of his fury by seeming.  But when Bull had\nspoken, and the others had answered, Ralph said to Bull, wrathfully\nstill, but like a man in his wits: \"Why didst thou say that thou\nwouldest slay her?\"  \"Hast thou found her?\" said Bull.  \"Nay,\" quoth\nRalph, sullenly.  \"Well, then,\" said Bull, \"when thou dost find her, we\nwill speak of it.\" Said Ralph:  \"Why didst thou say that she hath slain\nhim?\" \"I was put out of my wits by the sight of him dead,\" said Bull;\n\"But now I say mayhappen she hath slain him.\"\n\n\"And mayhappen not,\" said Clement; \"look here to the cleaving of his\nskull right through this iron headpiece, which he will have bought at\nCheaping Knowe (for I have seen suchlike in the armourers' booth\nthere): it must have taken a strong man to do this.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth the captain, \"and a big sword to boot: this is the stroke\nof a strong man wielding a good weapon.\"\n\nSaid Bull:  \"Well, and will my master bid me forego vengeance for my\nbrother's slaying, or that I bear him to purse?  Then let him slay me\nnow, for I am his thrall.\"  Said Ralph: \"Thou shalt do as thou wilt\nherein, and I also will do as I will.  For if she slew him, the taking\nof her captive should be set against the slaying.\"  \"That is but\nright,\" said the captain; \"but Sir Ralph, I bid thee take the word of\nan old man-at-arms for it, that she slew him not; neither she, nor any\nother woman.\"\n\nSaid Clement:  \"Well, let all this be.  But tell me, lord Ralph, what\nthou wouldst do, since now thou art come to thyself again?\" Said Ralph:\n\"I would seek the wilderness hereabout, if perchance the damsel be\nthrust into some cleft or cavern, alive or dead.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Clement, \"this is my rede.  Since Bull Shockhead would\nbury his brother, and lord Ralph would seek the damsel, and whereas\nthere is water anigh, and the sun is well nigh set, let us pitch our\ntents and abide here till morning, and let night bring counsel unto\nsome of us.  How say ye, fellows?\"\n\nNone naysaid it, and they fell to pitching the tents, and lighting the\ncooking-fires; but Bull at once betook him to digging a grave for his\nbrother, whilst Ralph with the captain and four others went and sought\nall about the place, and looked into all clefts of rocks, and found not\nthe maiden, nor any token of her.  They were long about it, and when\nthey were come back again, and it was night, though the moon shone out,\nthere was Bull Shockhead standing by the howe of his brother Bull Nosy,\nwhich was heaped up high over the place where they had found him.\n\nSo when Bull saw him, he turned to him and said: \"King's son, I have\ndone what needs was for this present.  Now, wilt thou slay me for my\nfault, or shall I be thy man again, and serve thee truly unless the\nblood feud come between us?\" Said Ralph:  \"Thou shalt serve me truly,\nand help me to find him who hath slain thy brother, and carried off the\ndamsel; for even thus it hath been done meseemeth, since about here we\nhave seen no signs of her alive or dead.  But to-morrow we shall seek\nwider ere I ride on my way.\" \"Yea,\" said Bull, \"and I will be one in\nthe search.\"\n\nSo then they gat them to their sleeping-berths, and Ralph, contrary to\nhis wont, lay long awake, pondering these things; till at last he said\nto himself that this woman, whom he called Dorothea, was certainly\nalive, and wotted that he was seeking her.  And then it seemed to him\nthat he could behold her through the darkness of night, clad in the\ngreen flowered gown as he had first seen her, and she bewailing her\ncaptivity and the long tarrying of the deliverer as she went to and fro\nin a great chamber builded of marble and done about with gold and\nbright colours: and or ever he slept, he deemed this to be a vision of\nwhat then was, rather than a memory of what had been; and it was sweet\nto his very soul.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\nClement Tells of Goldburg\n\n\nNow when it was morning he rose early and roused Bull and the captain,\nand they searched in divers places where they had not been the night\nbefore, and even a good way back about the road they had ridden\nyesterday, but found no tidings.  And Ralph said to himself that this\nwas naught but what he had looked for after that vision of the night.\n\nSo he rode with his fellows somewhat shamefaced that they had seen that\nsudden madness in him; but was presently of better cheer than he had\nbeen yet.  He rode beside Clement; they went downhill speedily, and the\nwilderness began to better, and there was grass at whiles, and bushes\nhere and there.  A little after noon they came out of a pass cleft deep\nthrough the rocks by a swift stream which had once been far greater\nthan then, and climbed up a steep ridge that lay across the road, and\nlooking down from the top of it, beheld the open country again.  But\nthis was otherwise from what they had beheld from the mountain's brow\nabove Cheaping Knowe.  For thence the mountains beyond Whiteness, even\nthose that they had just ridden, were clear to be seen like the wall of\nthe plain country.  But here, looking adown, the land below them seemed\nbut a great spreading plain with no hills rising from it, save that far\naway they could see a certain break in it, and amidst that, something\nthat was brighter than the face of the land elsewhere.  Clement told\nRalph that this was Goldburg and that it was built on a gathering of\nhills, not great, but going up steep from the plain.  And the plain,\nsaid he, was not so wholly flat and even as it looked from up there,\nbut swelled at whiles into downs and low hills.  He told him that\nGoldburg was an exceeding fair town to behold; that the lord who had\nbuilt it had brought from over the mountains masons and wood-wrights\nand artificers of all kinds, that they might make it as fair as might\nbe, and that he spared on it neither wealth nor toil nor pains.  For in\nsooth he deemed that he should find the Well at the World's End, and\ndrink thereof, and live long and young and fair past all record;\ntherefore had he builded this city, to be the house and home of his\nlong-enduring joyance.\n\nNow some said that he had found the Well, and drank thereof; others\nnaysaid that; but all deemed that they knew how that Goldburg was not\ndone building ere that lord was slain in a tumult, and that what was\nthen undone was cobbled up after the uncomely fashion of the towns\nthereabout.\n\nClement said moreover that, this happy lord dead, things had not gone\nso well there as had been looked for.  Forsooth it had been that lord's\nwill and meaning that all folks in Goldburg should thrive, both those\nwho wrought and those for whom they wrought.  But it went not so, but\nthere were many poor folk there, and few wealthy.\n\nAgain said Clement that though the tillers and toilers of Goldburg were\nnot for the most part mere thralls and chattels, as in the lands beyond\nthe mountains behind them, yet were they little more thriving for that\ncause; whereas they belonged not to a master, who must at worst feed\nthem, and to no manor, whose acres they might till for their\nlivelihood, and on whose pastures they might feed their cattle; nor had\nthey any to help or sustain them against the oppressor and the violent\nman; so that they toiled and swinked and died with none heeding them,\nsave they that had the work of their hands good cheap; and they\nforsooth heeded them less than their draught beasts whom they must\nneeds buy with money, and whose bellies they must needs fill; whereas\nthese poor wretches were slaves without a price, and if one died\nanother took his place on the chance that thereby he might escape\npresent death by hunger, for there was a great many of them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\nNow They Come to Goldburg\n\n\nThat night they slept yet amongst the mountains, or rather in the first\nof the hill country at their feet; but on the morrow they rode down\ninto the lowlands, and thereby lost all sight of Goldburg, and it was\nyet afar off, so that they rode four days through lands well-tilled,\nbut for the most part ill-housed, a country of little hills and hollows\nand rising grounds, before they came in sight of it again heaving up\nhuge and bright under the sun.  It was built partly on three hills, the\nbuttresses of a long ridge which turned a wide river, and on the ridge\nitself, and partly on the flat shore of the river, on either side,\nhillward and plainward: but a great white wall girt it all about, which\nwent right over the river as a bridge, and on the plain side it was\nexceeding high, so that its battlements might be somewhat evened with\nthose of the hill-wall above.  So that as they came up to the place\nthey saw little of the town because of the enormity of the wall; scarce\naught save a spire or a tall towering roof here and there.\n\nSo when they were come anigh the gate, they displayed their banners and\nrode right up to it; and people thronged the walls to see their riding.\nOne by one they passed through the wicket of the gate:  which gate\nitself was verily huge beyond measure, all built of great\nashlar-stones; and when they were within, it was like a hall somewhat\nlong and exceeding high, most fairly vaulted; midmost of the said hall\nthey rode through a noble arch on their right hand, and lo another hall\nexceeding long, but lower than the first, with many glazen windows set\nin its townward wall; and when they looked through these, they saw the\nriver running underneath; for this was naught but the lower bridge of\nthe city and they learned afterwards and saw, that above the vault of\nthis long bridge rose up the castle, chamber on chamber, till its\nbattlements were level with the highest towers of the wall on the hill\ntop.\n\nThus they passed the bridge, and turning to the left at its ending,\ncame into the Water-Street of Goldburg, where the river, with wide\nquays on either side thereof, ran betwixt the houses.  As for these,\nbeneath the dwellings went a fair arched passage like to the ambulatory\nof an abbey; and every house all along this street was a palace for its\ngoodliness.  The houses were built of white stones and red and grey;\nwith shapely pillars to the cloister, and all about carvings of imagery\nand knots of flowers; goodly were the windows and all glazed, as fair\nas might be.  On the river were great barges, and other craft such as\nwere not sea-goers, river-ships that might get them through the bridges\nand furnished with masts that might be lowered and shipped.\n\nMuch people was gathered to see the chapmen enter, yet scarce so many\nas might be looked for in so goodly a town; yea, and many of the folk\nwere clad foully, and were haggard of countenance, and cried on the\nchapmen for alms.  Howbeit some were clad gaily and richly enough, and\nwere fair of favour as any that Ralph had seen since he left Upmeads:\nand amongst these goodly folk were women not a few, whose gear and\nbearing called to Ralph's mind the women of the Wheatwearers whom he\nhad seen erst in the Burg of the Four Friths, whereas they were\nsomewhat wantonly clad in scanty and thin raiment.  And of these,\nthough they were not all thralls, were many who were in servitude:\nfor, as Clement did Ralph to wit, though the tillers of the soil, and\nthe herdsmen, in short the hewers of wood and drawers of water, were\nmen masterless, yet rich men might and did buy both men and women for\nservants in their houses, and for their pleasure and profit in divers\nwise.\n\nSo they rode to their hostel in the market place, which lay a little\nback from the river in an ingle of the ridge and one of its buttresses;\nand all round the said market were houses as fair as the first they had\nseen: but above, on the hill-sides, save for the castle and palace of\nthe Queen (for a woman ruled in Goldburg), were the houses but low,\npoorly built of post and pan, and thatched with straw, or reed, or\nshingle.  But the great church was all along one side of the market\nplace; and albeit this folk was somewhat wild and strange of faith for\nChristian men, yet was it dainty and delicate as might be, and its\nsteeples and bell-towers were high and well builded, and adorned\nexceeding richly.\n\nSo they lighted down at their hostel, and never had Ralph seen such\nanother, for the court within was very great and with a fair garden\nfilled with flowers and orchard-trees, and amidst it was a fountain of\nfresh water, built in the goodliest fashion of many-coloured\nmarble-stones. And the arched and pillared way about the said court was\nas fair as the cloister of a mitred abbey; and the hall for the guests\nwas of like fashion, vaulted with marvellous cunning, and with a row of\npillars amidmost.\n\nThere they abode in good entertainment; yet this noted Ralph, that as\ngoodly as was the fashion of the building of that house, yet the\nhangings and beds, and stools, and chairs, and other plenishing were no\nricher or better than might be seen in the hostelry of any good town.\n\nSo they went bedward, and Ralph slept dreamlessly, as was mostly his\nwont.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\nOf Goldburg and the Queen Thereof\n\n\nOn the morrow, when Ralph and Clement met in the hall, Clement spake\nand said:  \"Lord Ralph, as I told thee in Whitwall, we chapmen are now\nat the end of our outward journey, and in about twenty days time we\nshall turn back to the mountains; but, as I deem, thou wilt be minded\nto follow up thy quest of the damsel, and whatsoever else thou mayst be\nseeking.  Now this thou mayst well do whiles we are here in Goldburg,\nand yet come back hither in time to fare back with us: and also, if\nthou wilt, thou mayst have fellows in thy quest, to wit some of those\nour men-at-arms, who love thee well.  But now, when thou hast done thy\nbest these days during, if thou hast then found naught, I counsel thee\nand beseech thee to come thy ways back with us, that we twain may wend\nto Upmeads together, where thou shalt live well, and better all the\ndeeds of thy father.  Meseemeth this will be more meet for thee than\nthe casting away of thy life in seeking a woman, who maybe will be\nnaught to thee when thou hast found her; or in chasing some castle in\nthe clouds, that shall be never the nigher to thee, how far soever thou\nfarest.  For now I tell thee that I have known this while how thou art\nseeking the Well at the World's End; and who knoweth that there is any\nsuch thing on the earth?  Come, then, thou art fair, and young, and\nstrong; and if ye seek wealth thou shalt have it, and my furtherance to\nthe utmost, if that be aught worth.  Bethink thee, child, there are\nthey that love thee in Upmeads and thereabout, were it but thy gossip,\nmy wife, dame Katherine.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Master Clement, I thank thee for all that thou hast said,\nand thy behest, and thy deeds.  Thy rede is good, and in all ways will\nI follow it save one; to wit, that if I have not found the damsel ere\nye turn back, I must needs abide in this land searching for her.  And I\npray the pardon both of thee and of thy gossip, if I answer not your\nlove as ye would, and perchance as I should.  Yea, and of Upmeads also\nI crave pardon.  But in doing as I do, my deed shall be but according\nto the duty bounden on me by mine oath, when Duke Osmond made me knight\nlast year, in the church of St. Laurence of Upmeads.\"\n\nSaid Clement:  \"I see that there is something else in it than that; I\nsee thee to be young, and that love and desire bind thee in closer\nbonds than thy knightly oath.  Well, so it must be, and till thou hast\nher, there is but one woman in the world for thee.\"\n\n\"Nay, it is not so, Master Clement,\" said Ralph, \"and I will tell thee\nthis, so that thou mayst trow my naysay; since I departed from Upmeads,\nI have been taken in the toils of love, and desired a fair woman, and I\nhave won her and death hath taken her.  Trowest thou my word?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Clement, \"but to one of thy years love is not plucked up by\nthe root, and it soon groweth again.\"  Then said Ralph, sadly: \"Now\ntell my gossip of this when thou comest home.\" Clement nodded yeasay,\nand Ralph spake again in a moment: \"And now will I begin my search in\nGoldburg by praying thee to bring me to speech of merchants and others\nwho may have seen or heard tidings of my damsel.\"\n\nHe looked at Clement anxiously as he spoke; and Clement smiled, for he\nsaid to himself that looking into Ralph's heart on this matter was like\nlooking into a chamber through an open window.  But he said:  \"Fear not\nbut I will look to it; I am thy friend, and not thy schoolmaster.\"\n\nTherewith he departed from Ralph, and within three days he had brought\nhim to speech of all those who were like to know anything of the\nmatter; and one and all they said that they had seen no such woman, and\nthat as for the Lord of Utterbol, he had not been in Goldburg these\nthree months.  But one of the merchants said:  \"Master Clement, if this\nyoung knight is boun for Utterbol, he beareth his life in his hand, as\nthou knowest full well.  Now I rede thee bring him to our Queen, who is\ngood and compassionate, and if she may not help him otherwise, yet\nbelike she may give him in writing to show to that tyrant, which may\nstand him in stead: for it does not do for any man to go against the\nwill of our Lady and Queen; who will surely pay him back for his\nill-will some day or other.\" Said Clement:  \"It is well thought of, and\nI will surely do as thou biddest.\"\n\nSo wore four days, and, that time during, Ralph was going to and fro\nasking questions of folk that he came across, as people new come to the\ncity and hunters from the mountain-feet and the forests of the plain,\nand mariners and such like, concerning the damsel and the Lord of\nUtterbol; and Bull also went about seeking tidings: but whereas Ralph\nasked downright what he wanted to know, Bull was wary, and rather led\nmen on to talk with him concerning those things than asked them of them\nin such wise that they saw the question.  Albeit it was all one, and no\ntidings came to them; indeed, the name of the Lord of Utterbol (whom\nforsooth Bull named not) seemed to freeze the speech of men's tongues,\nand they commonly went away at once when it was spoken.\n\nOn the fifth day came Clement to Ralph and said: \"Now will I bring thee\nto the Queen, and she is young, and so fair, and withal so wise, that\nit seems to me not all so sure but that the sight of her will make an\nend of thy quest once for all.  So that meseems thou mayest abide here\nin a life far better than wandering amongst uncouth folk, perilous and\ncruel.  Yea, so thou mayst have it if thou wilt, being so exceeding\ngoodly, and wise, and well-spoken, and of high lineage.\"\n\nRalph heard and reddened, but gave him back no answer; and they went\ntogether to the High House of the Queen, which was like a piece of the\nKingdom of Heaven for loveliness, so many pillars as there were of\nbright marble stone, and gilded, and the chapiters carved most\nexcellently: not many hangings on the walls, for the walls themselves\nwere carven, and painted with pictures in the most excellent manner;\nthe floors withal were so dainty that they seemed as if they were made\nfor none but the feet of the fairest of women.  And all this was set\namidst of gardens, the like of which they had never seen.\n\nBut they entered without more ado, and were brought by the pages to the\nLady's innermost chamber; and if the rest of the house were goodly,\nthis was goodlier, and a marvel, so that it seemed wrought rather by\ngoldsmiths and jewellers than by masons and carvers.  Yet indeed many\nhad said with Clement that the Queen who sat there was the goodliest\npart thereof.\n\nNow she spake to Clement and said:  \"Hail, merchant!  Is this the young\nknight of whom thou tellest, he who seeketh his beloved that hath been\nborne away into thralldom by evil men?\"\n\n\"Even so,\" said Clement.  But Ralph spake:  \"Nay, Lady, the damsel whom\nI seek is not my beloved, but my friend.  My beloved is dead.\"\n\nThe Queen looked on him smiling kindly, yet was her face somewhat\ntroubled.  She said:  \"Master chapman, thy time here is not over long\nfor all that thou hast to do; so we give thee leave to depart with our\nthanks for bringing a friend to see us.  But this knight hath no\naffairs to look to: so if he will abide with us for a little, it will\nbe our pleasure.\"\n\nSo Clement made his obeisance and went his ways.  But the Queen bade\nRalph sit before her, and tell her of his griefs, and she looked so\nkindly and friendly upon him that the heart melted within him, and he\nmight say no word, for the tears that brake out from him, and he wept\nbefore her; while she looked on him, the colour coming and going in her\nface, and her lips trembling, and let him weep on.  But he thought not\nof her, but of himself and how kind she was to him.  But after a while\nhe mastered his passion and began, and told her all he had done and\nsuffered.  Long was the tale in the telling, for it was sweet to him to\nlay before her both his grief and his hope.  She let him talk on, and\nwhiles she listened to him, and whiles, not, but all the time she gazed\non him, yet sometimes askance, as if she were ashamed.  As for him, he\nsaw her face how fair and lovely she was, yet was there little longing\nin his heart for her, more than for one of the painted women on the\nwall, for as kind and as dear as he deemed her.\n\nWhen he had done, she kept silence a while, but at last she enforced\nher, and spake:  \"Sad it is for the mother that bore thee that thou art\nnot in her house, wherein all things would be kind and familiar to\nthee.  Maybe thou art seeking for what is not.  Or maybe thou shalt\nseek and shalt find, and there may be naught in what thou findest,\nwhereof to give thee such gifts as are meet for thy faithfulness and\nvaliancy.  But in thine home shouldst thou have all gifts which thou\nmayest desire.\"\n\nThen was she silent awhile, and then spake:  \"Yet must I needs say that\nI would that thine home were in Goldburg.\"\n\nHe smiled sadly and looked on her, but with no astonishment, and indeed\nhe still scarce thought of her as he said: \"Lady and Queen, thou art\ngood to me beyond measure.  Yet, look you!  One home I had, and left\nit; another I looked to have, and I lost it; and now I have no home.\nMaybe in days to come I shall go back to mine old home; and whiles I\nwonder with what eyes it will look on me.  For merry is that land, and\ndear; and I have become sorrowful.\"\n\n\"Fear not,\" she said; \"I say again that in thine home shall all things\nlook kindly on thee.\"\n\nOnce more she sat silent, and no word did his heart bid him speak.\nThen she sighed and said:  \"Fair lord, I bid thee come and go in this\nhouse as thou wilt; but whereas there are many folk who must needs see\nme, and many things are appointed for me to do, therefore I pray thee\nto come hither in three days' space, and meanwhile I will look to the\nmatter of thy search, that I may speed thee on the way to Utterness,\nwhich is no great way from Utterbol, and is the last town whereof we\nknow aught.  And I will write a letter for thee to give to the lord of\nUtterbol, which he will heed, if he heedeth aught my good-will or\nenmity.  I beseech thee come for it in three days wearing.\"\n\nTherewith she arose and took his hand and led him to the door, and he\ndeparted, blessing her goodness, and wondering at her courtesy and\ngentle speech.\n\nFor those three days he was still seeking tidings everywhere, till folk\nbegan to know of him far and wide, and to talk of him.  And at the time\nappointed he went to the Queen's House and was brought to her chamber\nas before, and she was alone therein.  She greeted him and smiled on\nhim exceeding kindly, but he might not fail to note of her that she\nlooked sad and her face was worn by sorrow.  She bade him sit beside\nher, and said: \"Hast thou any tidings of the woman whom thou seekest?\"\n\"Nay, nay,\" said he, \"and now I am minded to carry on the search\nout-a-gates. I have some good friends who will go with me awhile.  But\nthou, Lady, hast thou heard aught?\"\n\n\"Naught of the damsel,\" she said.  \"But there is something else.  As\nClement told me, thou seekest the Well at the World's End, and through\nUtterness and by Utterbol is a way whereby folk seek thither.  Mayst\nthou find it, and may it profit thee more than it did my kinsman of\nold, who first raised up Goldburg in the wilderness.  Whereas for him\nwas naught but strife and confusion, till he was slain in a quarrel,\nwherein to fail was to fail, and to win the day was to win shame and\nmisery.\"\n\nShe looked on him sweetly and said:  \"Thou art nowise such as he; and\nif thou drink of the Well, thou wilt go back to Upmeads, and thy father\nand mother, and thine own folk and thine home.  But now here is the\nletter which thou shalt give to the Lord of Utterbol if thou meet him;\nand mayhappen he is naught so evil a man as the tale of him runs.\"\n\nShe gave him the letter into his hands, and spake again: \"And now I\nhave this to say to thee, if anything go amiss with thee, and thou be\nnigh enough to seek to me, come hither, and then, in whatso plight thou\nmayst be, or whatsoever deed thou mayst have done, here will be the\nopen door for thee and the welcome of a friend.\"\n\nHer voice shook a little as she spake, and she was silent again,\nmastering her trouble.  Then she said:  \"At last I must say this to\nthee, that there may no lie be between us.  That damsel of whom thou\nspakest that she was but thy friend, and not thy love--O that I might\nbe thy friend in such-wise! But over clearly I see that it may not be\nso.  For thy mind looketh on thy deeds to come, that they shall be\nshared by some other than me.  Friend, it seemeth strange and strange\nto me that I have come on thee so suddenly, and loved thee so sorely,\nand that I must needs say farewell to thee in so short a while.\nFarewell, farewell!\"\n\nTherewith she arose, and once more she took his hand in hers, and led\nhim to the door.  And he was sorry and all amazed: for he had not\nthought so much of her before, that he might see that she loved him;\nand he thought but that she, being happy and great, was kind to him who\nwas hapless and homeless.  And he was bewildered by her words and sore\nashamed that for all his grief for her he had no speech, and scarce a\nlook for her; he knew not what to do or say.\n\nSo he left the Queen's House and the court thereof, as though the\npavement were growing red hot beneath his feet.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\nRalph Hath Hope of Tidings Concerning the Well at the World's End\n\n\nNow he goes to Clement, and tells him that he deems he has no need to\nabide their departure from Goldburg to say farewell and follow his\nquest further afield; since it is clear that in Goldburg he should have\nno more tidings.  Clement laughed and said: \"Not so fast, Lord Ralph;\nthou mayst yet hear a word or two.\" \"What!\" said Ralph, \"hast thou\nheard of something new?\" Said Clement:  \"There has been a man here\nseeking thee, who said that he wotted of a wise man who could tell thee\nmuch concerning the Well at the World's End.  And when I asked him of\nthe Damsel and the Lord of Utterbol, if he knew anything of her, he\nsaid yea, but that he would keep it for thy privy ear.  So I bade him\ngo and come again when thou shouldst be here.  And I deem that he will\nnot tarry long.\"\n\nNow they were sitting on a bench outside the hall of the hostel, with\nthe court between them and the gate; and Ralph said: \"Tell me, didst\nthou deem the man good or bad?\"  Said Clement: \"He was hard to look\ninto:  but at least he looked not a fierce or cruel man; nor indeed did\nhe seem false or sly, though I take him for one who hath lost his\nmanhood--but lo you! here he comes across the court.\"\n\nSo Ralph looked, and saw in sooth a man drawing nigh, who came straight\nup to them and lowted to them, and then stood before them waiting for\ntheir word:  he was fat and somewhat short, white-faced and\npink-cheeked, with yellow hair long and curling, and with a little thin\nred beard and blue eyes: altogether much unlike the fashion of men of\nthose parts.  He was clad gaily in an orange-tawny coat laced with\nsilver, and broidered with colours.\n\nClement spake to him and said:  \"This is the young knight who is minded\nto seek further east to wot if it be mere lies which he hath heard of\nthe Well at the World's End.\"\n\nThe new-comer lowted before them again, and said in a small voice, and\nas one who was shy and somewhat afeared:  \"Lords, I can tell many a\ntale concerning that Well, and them who have gone on the quest thereof.\nAnd the first thing I have to tell is that the way thereto is through\nUtterness, and that I can be a shower of the way and a leader to any\nworthy knight who listeth to seek thither; and moreover, I know of a\nsage who dwelleth not far from the town of Utterness, and who, if he\nwill, can put a seeker of the Well on the right road.\"\n\nHe looked askance on Ralph, whose face flushed and whose eyes glittered\nat that word.  But Clement said:  \"Yea, that seemeth fair to look to:\nbut hark ye!  Is it not so that the way to Utterness is perilous?\" Said\nthe man:  \"Thou mayst rather call it deadly, to any who is not\nfurnished with a let-pass from the Lord of Utterbol, as I am.  But with\nsuch a scroll a child or a woman may wend the road unharmed.\" \"Where\nhast thou the said let-pass?\" said Clement.  \"Here,\" quoth the\nnew-comer; and therewith he drew a scroll from out of his pouch, and\nopened it before them, and they read it together, and sure enough it\nwas a writing charging all men so let pass and aid Morfinn the Minstrel\n(of whose aspect it told closely), under pain of falling into the\ndispleasure of Gandolf, Lord of Utterbol; and the date thereon was but\nthree months old.\n\nSaid Clement:  \"This is good, this let-pass: see thou, Ralph, the seal\nof Utterbol, the Bear upon the Castle Wall.  None would dare to\ncounterfeit this seal, save one who was weary of life, and longed for\ntorments.\"\n\nSaid Ralph, smiling:  \"Thou seest, Master Clement, that there must be a\nparting betwixt us, and that this man's coming furthers it: but were he\nor were he not, yet the parting had come.  And wert thou not liefer\nthat it should come in a way to pleasure and aid me, than that thou\nshouldst but leave me behind at Goldburg when thou departest: and I\nwith naught done toward the achieving my quest, but merely dragging my\ndeedless body about these streets; and at last, it may be, going on a\nperilous journey without guiding or safe-conduct?\"\n\n\"Yea, lad,\" said Clement, \"I wotted well that thou wouldst take thine\nown way, but fain had I been that it had been mine also.\" Then he\npondered a while and said afterwards:  \"I suppose that thou wilt take\nthy servant Bull Shockhead with thee, for he is a stout man-at-arms,\nand I deem him trusty, though he be a wild man.  But one man is of\nlittle avail to a traveller on a perilous road, so if thou wilt I will\ngive leave and license to a half score of our sergeants to follow thee\non the road; for, as thou wottest, I may easily wage others in their\nplace.  Or else wouldst thou ask the Queen of Goldburg to give thee a\nscore of men-at-arms; she looked to me the other day as one who would\ndeny thee few of thine askings.\"\n\nRalph blushed red, and said:  \"Nay, I will not ask her this.\" Then he\nwas silent; the new-comer looked from one to the other, and said\nnothing.  At last Ralph spake:  \"Look you, Clement, my friend, I wot\nwell how thou wouldst make my goings safe, even if it were to thy loss,\nand I thank thee for it:  but I deem I shall do no better than putting\nmyself into this man's hands, since he has a let-pass for the lands of\nhim of Utterbol: and meseemeth from all that I have heard, that a half\nscore or a score, or for the matter of that an hundred men-at-arms\nwould not be enough to fight a way to Utterbol, and their gathering\ntogether would draw folk upon them, who would not meddle with two men\njourneying together, even if they had no let-pass of this mighty man.\"\nClement sighed and grunted, and then said: \"Well, lord, maybe thou art\nright.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the guide, \"he is as right as may be: I have not spoken\nbefore lest ye might have deemed me untrusty: but now I tell thee this,\nthat never should a small band of men unknown win through the lands of\nthe Lord of Utterbol, or the land debatable that lieth betwixt them and\nGoldburg.\"\n\nRalph nodded friendly at him as he spake; but Clement looked on him\nsternly; and the man beheld his scowling face innocently, and took no\nheed of it.\n\nThen said Ralph:  \"As to Bull Shockhead, I will speak to him anon; but\nI will not take him with me; for indeed I fear lest his mountain-pride\ngrow up over greenly at whiles and entangle me in some thicket of peril\nhard to win out of.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Clement, \"and when wilt thou depart?\" \"To-morrow,\" said\nRalph, \"if my faring-fellow be ready for me by then.\" \"I am all ready,\"\nsaid the man:  \"if thou wilt ride out by the east gate about two hours\nbefore noon to-morrow, I will abide thee on a good horse with all that\nwe may need for the journey: and now I ask leave.\"  \"Thou hast it,\"\nsaid Clement.\n\nSo the man departed, and those two being left alone, Master Clement\nsaid: \"Well, I deemed that nothing else would come of it:  and I fear\nthat thy gossip will be ill-content with me; for great is the peril.\"\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and great the reward.\"  Clement smiled and sighed,\nand said:  \"Well, lad, even so hath a many thought before thee, wise\nmen as well as fools.\"  Ralph looked at him and reddened, and departed\nfrom him a little, and went walking in the cloister there to and fro,\nand pondered these matters; and whatever he might do, still would that\ntrim figure be before his eyes which he had looked on so gladly\nerewhile in the hostel of Bourton Abbas; and he said aloud to himself:\n\"Surely she needeth me, and draweth me to her whether I will or no.\" So\nwore the day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31\n\nThe Beginning of the Road To Utterbol\n\n\nEarly next morning Ralph arose and called Bull Shockhead to him and\nsaid:  \"So it is, Bull, that thou art my war-taken thrall.\" Bull nodded\nhis head, but frowned therewithal.  Said Ralph: \"If I bid thee aught\nthat is not beyond reason thou wilt do it, wilt thou not?\"  \"Yea,\" said\nBull, surlily.  \"Well,\" quoth Ralph, \"I am going a journey east-away,\nand I may not have thee with me, therefore I bid thee take this gold\nand go free with my goodwill.\" Bull's face lighted up, and the eyes\nglittered in his face; but he said: \"Yea, king's son, but why wilt thou\nnot take me with thee?\" Said Ralph:  \"It is a perilous journey, and thy\nbeing with me will cast thee into peril and make mine more.  Moreover,\nI have an errand, as thou wottest, which is all mine own.\"\n\nBull pondered a little and then said:  \"King's son, I was thinking at\nfirst that our errands lay together, and it is so; but belike thou\nsayest true that there will be less peril to each of us if we sunder at\nthis time.  But now I will say this to thee, that henceforth thou shalt\nbe as a brother to me, if thou wilt have it so, and if ever thou comest\namongst our people, thou wilt be in no danger of them:  nay, they shall\ndo all the good they may to thee.\"\n\nThen he took him by the hand and kissed him, and he set his hand to his\ngear and drew forth a little purse of some small beast's skin that was\nbroidered in front with a pair of bull's horns: then he stooped down\nand plucked a long and tough bent from the grass at his feet (for they\nwere talking in the garden of the hostel) and twisted it swiftly into a\nstrange knot of many plies, and opening the purse laid it therein and\nsaid: \"King's son, this is the token whereby it shall be known amongst\nour folk that I have made thee my brother:  were the flames roaring\nabout thee, or the swords clashing over thine head, if thou cry out, I\nam the brother of Bull Shockhead, all those of my kindred who are near\nwill be thy friends and thy helpers.  And now I say to thee farewell:\nbut it is not altogether unlike that thou mayst hear of me again in the\nfurthest East.\" So Ralph departed from him, and Clement went with Ralph\nto the Gate of Goldburg, and bade him farewell there; and or they\nparted he said: \"Meseems I have with me now some deal of the foreseeing\nof Katherine my wife, and in my mind it is that we shall yet see thee\nat Wulstead and Upmeads, and thou no less famous than now thou art.\nThis is my last word to thee.\"  Therewith they parted, and Ralph rode\nhis ways.\n\nHe came on his way-leader about a bowshot from the gate and they\ngreeted each other:  the said guide was clad no otherwise than\nyesterday: he had saddle-bags on his horse, which was a strong black\nroadster: but he was nowise armed, and bore but a satchel with a case\nof knives done on to it, and on the other side a fiddle in its case.\nSo Ralph smiled on him and said:  \"Thou hast no weapon, then?\" \"What\nneed for weapon?\" said he; \"since we are not of might for battle.  This\nis my weapon,\" said he, touching his fiddle, \"and withal it is my field\nand mine acre that raiseth flesh-meat and bread for me: yea, and whiles\na little drink.\"\n\nSo they rode on together and the man was blithe and merry: and Ralph\nsaid to him:  \"Since we are fellows for a good while, as I suppose,\nwhat shall I call thee?\"  Said he, \"Morfinn the Minstrel I hight, to\nserve thee, fair lord.  Or some call me Morfinn the Unmanned.  Wilt\nthou not now ask me concerning that privy word that I had for thy\nears?\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph reddening, \"hath it to do with a woman?\"\n\"Naught less,\" said Morfinn.  \"For I heard of thee asking many\nquestions thereof in Goldburg, and I said to myself, now may I, who am\nbound for Utterness, do a good turn to this fair young lord, whose face\nbewrayeth his heart, and telleth all men that he is kind and bounteous;\nso that there is no doubt but he will reward me well at once for any\nhelp I may give him; and also it may be that he will do me a good turn\nhereafter in memory of this that I have done him.\"\n\n\"Speak, wilt thou not,\" said Ralph, \"and tell me at once if thou hast\nseen this woman?  Be sure that I shall reward thee.\"  \"Nay, nay, fair\nsir,\" said Morfinn; \"a woman I have seen brought captive to the House\nof Utterbol.  See thou to it if it be she whom thou seekest.\"\n\nHe smiled therewith, but now Ralph deemed him not so debonnaire as he\nhad at first, for there was mocking in the smile; therefore he was\nwroth, but he refrained him and said: \"Sir Minstrel, I wot not why thou\nhast come with a tale in thy mouth and it will not out of it:  lo you,\nwill this open the doors of speech to thee\" (and he reached his hand\nout to him with two pieces of gold lying therein) \"or shall this?\" and\ntherewith he half drew his sword from his sheath.\n\nSaid Morfinn, grinning again:  \"Nay, I fear not the bare steel in thine\nhands, Knight; for thou hast not fool written plain in thy face;\ntherefore thou wilt not slay thy way-leader, or even anger him over\nmuch.  And as to thy gold, the wages shall be paid at the journey's\nend.  I was but seeking about in my mind how best to tell thee my tale\nso that thou mightest believe my word, which is true.  Thus it goes: As\nI left Utterbol a month ago, I saw a damsel brought in captive there,\nand she seemed to me so exceeding fair that I looked hard on her, and\nasked one of the men-at-arms who is my friend concerning the market\nwhereat she was cheapened; and he told me that she had not been bought,\nbut taken out of the hands of the wild men from the further mountains.\nIs that aught like to your story, lord?\"  \"Yea,\" said Ralph, knitting\nhis brows in eagerness.  \"Well,\" said Morfinn, \"but there are more fair\nwomen than one in the world, and belike this is not thy friend: so now,\nas well as I may, I will tell thee what-like she was, and if thou\nknowest her not, thou mayst give me those two gold pieces and go back\nagain.  She was tall rather than short, and slim rather than bigly\nmade.  But many women are fashioned so: and doubtless she was worn by\ntravel, since she has at least come from over the mountains:  but that\nis little to tell her by: her hands, and her feet also (for she was a\nhorseback and barefoot) wrought well beyond most women:  yet so might\nit have been with some: yet few, methinks, of women who have worked\nafield, as I deem her to have done, would have hands and feet so\nshapely:  her face tanned with the sun, but with fair colour shining\nthrough it; her hair brown, yet with a fair bright colour shining\ntherein, and very abundant: her cheeks smooth, round and well wrought\nas any imager could do them: her chin round and cloven:  her lips full\nand red, but firm-set as if she might be both valiant and wroth.  Her\neyes set wide apart, grey and deep:  her whole face sweet of aspect, as\nthough she might be exceeding kind to one that pleased her; yet high\nand proud of demeanour also, meseemed, as though she were come of great\nkindred.  Is this aught like to thy friend?\"\n\nHe spake all this slowly and smoothly and that mocking smile came into\nhis face now and again.  Ralph grew pale as he spoke and knitted his\nbrows as one in great wrath and grief; and he was slow to answer; but\nat last he said \"Yea,\" shortly and sharply.\n\nThen said Morfinn:  \"And yet after all it might not be she: for there\nmight be another or two even in these parts of whom all this might be\nsaid.  But now I will tell thee of her raiment, though there may be but\nlittle help to thee therein, as she may have shifted it many times\nsince thou hast seen her.  Thus it was: she was clad outwardly in a\ngreen gown, short of skirt as of one wont to go afoot; somewhat\nstraight in the sleeves as of one who hath household work to do, and\nthere was broidery many coloured on the seams thereof, and a border of\nflower-work round the hem: and this I noted, that a cantle of the skirt\nhad been rent away by some hap of the journey.  Now what sayest thou,\nfair lord?  Have I done well to bring thee this tale?\"\n\n\"O yea, yea,\" said Ralph, and he might not contain himself; but set\nspurs to his horse and galloped on ahead for some furlong or so: and\nthen drew rein and gat off his horse, and made as if he would see to\nhis saddle-girths, for he might not refrain from weeping the sweet and\nbitter tears of desire and fear, so stirred the soul within him.\n\nMorfinn rode on quietly, and by then he came up, Ralph was mounting\nagain, and when he was in the saddle he turned away his head from his\nfellow and said in a husky voice: \"Morfinn, I command thee, or if thou\nwilt I beseech thee, that thou speak not to me again of this woman whom\nI am seeking; for it moveth me over much.\"  \"That is well, lord,\" said\nMorfinn, \"I will do after thy command; and there be many other matters\nto speak of besides one fair woman.\"\n\nThen they rode on soberly a while, and Ralph kept silence, as he rode\npondering much; but the minstrel hummed snatches of rhyme as he rode\nthe way.\n\nBut at last Ralph turned to him suddenly and said:  \"Tell me,\nway-leader, in what wise did they seem to be using that woman?\" The\nminstrel chuckled:  \"Fair lord,\" said he, \"if I had a mind for mocking\nI might say of thee that thou blowest both hot and cold, since it was\nbut half an hour ago that thou badest me speak naught of her:  but I\ndeem that I know thy mind herein: so I will tell thee that they seemed\nto be using her courteously; as is no marvel; for who would wish to mar\nso fair an image?  O, it will be well with her:  I noted that the Lord\nseemed to think it good to ride beside her, and eye her all over.  Yea,\nshe shall have a merry life of it if she but do somewhat after the\nLord's will.\"\n\nRalph looked askance at him fiercely, but the other heeded it naught:\nthen said Ralph, \"And how if she do not his will?\"  Said Morfinn,\ngrinning: \"Then hath my Lord a many servants to do his will.\"  Ralph\nheld his peace for a long while; at last he turned a cleared brow to\nMorfinn and said; \"Dost thou tell of the Lord of Utterbol that he is a\ngood lord and merciful to his folk and servants?\"\n\n\"Fair sir,\" said the minstrel; \"thou hast bidden me not speak of one\nwoman, now will I pray thee not to speak of one man, and that is my\nLord of Utterbol.\"\n\nRalph's heart fell at this word, and he asked no question as to\nwherefore.\n\nSo now they rode on both, rather more than soberly for a while: but the\nday was fair; the sun shone, the wind blew, and the sweet scents\nfloated about them, and Ralph's heart cast off its burden somewhat and\nhe fell to speech again; and the minstrel answered him gaily by\nseeming, noting many things as they rode along, as one that took\ndelight in the fashion of the earth.\n\nIt was a fresh and bright morning of early autumn, the sheaves were on\nthe acres, and the grapes were blackening to the vintage, and the\nbeasts and birds at least were merry.  But little merry were the\nhusbandmen whom they met, either carles or queans, and they were\nscantily and foully clad, and sullen-faced, if not hunger-pinched.\n\nIf they came across any somewhat joyous, it was here and there certain\ngangrel folk resting on the wayside grass, or coming out of woods and\nother passes by twos and threes, whiles with a child or two with them.\nThese were of aspect like to the gipsies of our time and nation, and\nwere armed all of them, and mostly well clad after their fashion.\nSometimes when there were as many as four or five carles of them\ntogether, they would draw up amidst of the highway, but presently would\nturn aside at the sight either of Ralph's war-gear or of the minstrel's\nraiment.  Forsooth, some of them seemed to know him, and nodded\nfriendly to him as they passed by, but he gave them back no good day.\n\nThey had now ridden out of the lands of Goldburg, which were narrow on\nthat side, and the day was wearing fast.  This way the land was fair\nand rich, with no hills of any size.  They crossed a big river twice by\nbridges, and small streams often, mostly by fords.\n\nSome two hours before sunset they came upon a place where a byway\njoined the high road, and on the ingle stood a chapel of stone (whether\nof the heathen or Christian men Ralph wotted not, for it was uncouth of\nfashion), and by the door of the said chapel, on a tussock of grass,\nsat a knight all-armed save the head, and beside him a squire held his\nwar-horse, and five other men-at-arms stood anigh bearing halberds and\naxes of strange fashion.  The knight rose to his feet when he saw the\nwayfarers coming up the rising ground, and Ralph had his hand on his\nsword-hilt; but ere they met, the minstrel said,--\n\n\"Nay, nay, draw thy let-pass, not thy sword.  This knight shalt bid\nthee to a courteous joust; but do thou nay-say it, for he is a mere\nfelon, and shalt set his men-at-arms on thee, and then will rob thee\nand slay thee after, or cast thee into his prison.\"\n\nSo Ralph drew out his parchment which Morfinn had given into his\nkeeping, and held it open in his hand, and when the knight called out\non him in a rough voice as they drew anigh, he said: \"Nay, sir, I may\nnot stay me now, need driveth me on.\" Quoth the knight, smoothing out a\nknitted brow:  \"Fair sir, since thou art a friend of our lord, wilt\nthou not come home to my house, which is hard by, and rest awhile, and\neat a morsel, and drink a cup, and sleep in a fair chamber thereafter?\"\n\n\"Nay, sir,\" said Ralph, \"for time presses;\" and he passed on withal,\nand the knight made no step to stay him, but laughed a short laugh,\nlike a swine snorting, and sat him down on the grass again.  Ralph\nheeded him naught, but was glad that his let-pass was shown to be good\nfor something; but he could see that the minstrel was nigh sick for\nfear and was shaking like an aspen leaf, and it was long ere he found\nhis tongue again.\n\nForth then they rode till dusk, when the minstrel stayed Ralph at a\nplace where a sort of hovels lay together about a house somewhat better\nbuilded, which Ralph took for a hostelry, though it had no sign nor\nbush.  They entered the said house, wherein was an old woman to whom\nthe minstrel spake a word or two in a tongue that Ralph knew not, and\nstraightway she got them victual and drink nowise ill, and showed them\nto beds thereafter.\n\nIn spite of both victuals and drink the minstrel fell silent and moody;\nit might be from weariness, Ralph deemed; and he himself had no great\nlust for talk, so he went bedward, and made the bed pay for all.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32\n\nRalph Happens on Evil Days\n\n\nEarly on the morrow they departed, and now in the morning light and the\nsun the minstrel seemed glad again, and talked abundantly, even though\nat whiles Ralph answered him little.\n\nAs they rode, the land began to get less fertile and less, till at last\nthere was but tillage here and there in patches: of houses there were\nbut few, and the rest was but dark heathland and bog, with scraggy\nwoods scattered about the country-side.\n\nNaught happened to tell of, save that once in the afternoon, as they\nwere riding up to the skirts of one of the woods aforesaid, weaponed\nmen came forth from it and drew up across the way; they were a dozen in\nall, and four were horsed.  Ralph set his hand to his sword, but the\nminstrel cried out, \"Nay, no weapons, no weapons!  Pull out thy\nlet-pass again and show it in thine hand, and then let us on.\"\n\nSo saying he drew a white kerchief from his hand, and tied it to the\nend of his riding staff, and so rode trembling by Ralph's side:\ntherewith they rode on together towards those men, whom as they drew\nnearer they heard laughing and jeering at them, though in a tongue that\nRalph knew not.\n\nThey came so close at last that the waylayers could see the parchment\nclearly, with the seal thereon, and then they made obeisance to it, as\nthough it were the relic of a saint, and drew off quietly into the wood\none by one.  These were big men, and savage-looking, and their armour\nwas utterly uncouth.\n\nThe minstrel was loud in his mirth when they were well past these men;\nbut Ralph rode on silently, and was somewhat soberly.\n\n\"Fair sir,\" quoth the minstrel, \"I would wager that I know thy\nthought.\"  \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"what is it then?\" Said the minstrel:\n\"Thou art thinking what thou shalt do when thou meetest suchlike folk\non thy way back; but fear not, for with that same seal thou shalt pass\nthrough the land again.\" Said Ralph:  \"Yea, something like that,\nforsooth, was my thought.  But also I was pondering who should be my\nguide when I leave Utterbol.\"  The minstrel looked at him askance;\nquoth he: \"Thou mayst leave thinking of that awhile.\"  Ralph looked\nhard at him, but could make naught of the look of his face; so he said:\n\"Why dost thou say that?\"  Said Morfinn: \"Because I know whither thou\nart bound, and have been wondering this long while that thou hast asked\nme not about the way to the WELL at the WORLD'S END:  since I told thy\nfriend the merchant that I could tell thee somewhat concerning it.  But\nI suppose thou hast been thinking of something else?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ralph, \"tell me what thou hast to say of the Well.\" Said\nMorfinn:  \"This will I tell thee first:  that if thou hast any doubt\nthat such a place there is, thou mayst set that aside; for we of\nUtterness and Utterbol are sure thereof; and of all nations and peoples\nwhereof we know, we deem that we are the nighest thereto.  How sayest\nthou, is that not already something?\" \"Yea, verily,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Now,\" said Morfinn, \"the next thing to be said is that we are on the\nroad thereto:  but the third thing again is this, lord, that though few\nwho seek it find it, yet we know that some have failed not of it,\nbesides that lord of Goldburg, of whom I know that thou hast heard.\nFurthermore, there dwelleth a sage in the woods not right far from\nUtterbol, a hermit living by himself; and folk seek to him for divers\nlore, to be holpen by him in one way or other, and of him men say that\nhe hath so much lore concerning the road to the Well (whether he hath\nbeen there himself they know not certainly), that if he will, he can\nput anyone on the road so surely that he will not fail to come there,\nbut he be slain on the way, as I said to thee in Goldburg.  True it is\nthat the said sage is chary of his lore, and if he think any harm of\nthe seeker, he will show him naught; but, fair sir, thou art so valiant\nand so goodly, and as meseemeth so good a knight per amours, that I\ndeem it a certain thing that he will tell thee the uttermost of his\nknowledge.\"\n\nNow again waxed Ralph eager concerning his quest; for true it is that\nsince he had had that story of the damsel from the minstrel, she had\nstood in the way before the Well at the World's End.  But now he said:\n\"And canst thou bring me to the said sage, good minstrel?\" \"Without\ndoubt,\" quoth Morfinn, \"when we are once safe at Utterbol.  From\nUtterbol ye may wend any road.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and there are perils yet a few on the way, is it\nnot so?\" \"So it is,\" said the minstrel; \"but to-morrow shall try all.\"\nSaid Ralph: \"And is there some special peril ahead to-morrow? And if it\nbe so, what is it?\"  Said his fellow:  \"It would avail thee naught to\nknow it.  What then, doth that daunt thee?\"  \"No,\" said Ralph, \"by then\nit is nigh enough to hurt us, we shall be nigh enough to see it.\"\n\"Well said!\" quoth the minstrel; \"but now we must mend our pace, or\ndark night shall overtake us amid these rough ways.\"\n\nWild as the land was, they came at even to a place where were a few\nhouses of woodmen or hunters; and they got off their horses and knocked\nat the door of one of these, and a great black-haired carle opened to\nthem, who, when he saw the knight's armour, would have clapped the door\nto again, had not Ralph by the minstrel's rede held out the parchment\nto him, who when he saw it became humble indeed, and gave them such\nguesting as he might, which was scant indeed of victual or drink, save\nwild-fowl from the heath.  But they had wine with them from the last\nguest-house, whereof they bade the carle to drink; but he would not,\nand in all wise seemed to be in dread of them.\n\nWhen it was morning early they rode their ways, and the carle seemed\nglad to be rid of them.  After they had ridden a few miles the land\nbettered somewhat; there were islands of deep green pasture amidst the\nblackness of the heath, with cattle grazing on them, and here and there\nwas a little tillage: the land was little better than level, only it\nswelled a little this way and that.  It was a bright sunny day and the\nair very clear, and as they rode Ralph said:  \"Quite clear is the sky,\nand yet one cloud there is in the offing; but this is strange about it,\nthough I have been watching it this half hour, and looking to see the\nrack come up from that quarter, yet it changes not at all.  I never saw\nthe like of this cloud.\"\n\nSaid the minstrel:  \"Yea, fair sir, and of this cloud I must tell thee\nthat it will change no more till the bones of the earth are tumbled\ntogether.  Forsooth this is no cloud, but the topmost head of the\nmountain ridge which men call the Wall of the World:  and if ever thou\ncome close up to the said Wall, that shall fear thee, I deem, however\nfearless thou be.\" \"Is it nigh to Utterness?\" said Ralph.  \"Nay,\" said\nthe minstrel, \"not so nigh; for as huge as it seemeth thence.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Do folk tell that the Well at the World's End lieth\nbeyond it?\" \"Surely,\" said the minstrel.\n\nSaid Ralph, his face flushing:  \"Forsooth, that ancient lord of\nGoldburg came through those mountains, and why not I?\" \"Yea,\" said the\nminstrel, \"why not?\"  And therewith he looked uneasily on Ralph, who\nheeded his looks naught, for his mind was set on high matters.\n\nOn then they rode, and when trees or some dip in the land hid that\nmountain top from them, the way seemed long to Ralph.\n\nNaught befell to tell of for some while; but at last, when it was\ndrawing towards evening again, they had been riding through a thick\npine-wood for a long while, and coming out of it they beheld before\nthem a plain country fairly well grassed, but lo! on the field not far\nfrom the roadside a pavilion pitched and a banner on the top thereof,\nbut the banner hung down about the staff, so that the bearing was not\nseen: and about this pavilion, which was great and rich of fashion,\nwere many tents great and small, and there were horses tethered in the\nfield, and men moving about the gleam of armour.\n\nAt this sight the minstrel drew rein and stared about him wildly; but\nRalph said:  \"What is this, is it the peril aforesaid?\" \"Yea,\" quoth\nthe minstrel, shivering with fear.  \"What aileth thee?\" said Ralph;\n\"have we not the let-pass, what then can befall us?  If this be other\nthan the Lord of Utterbol, he will see our let-pass and let us alone;\nor if it be he indeed, what harm shall he do to the bearers of his own\npass?  Come on then, or else (and therewith he half drew his sword) is\nthis Lord of Utterbol but another name for the Devil in Hell?\"\n\nBut the minstrel still stared wild and trembled; then he stammered out:\n\"I thought I should bring thee to Utterness first, and that some other\nshould lead thee thence, I did not look to see him.  I dare not, I dare\nnot!  O look, look!\"\n\nAs he spake the wind arose and ran along the wood-side, and beat back\nfrom it and stirred the canvas of the tents and raised the folds of the\nbanner, and blew it out, so that the bearing was clear to see; yet\nRalph deemed it naught dreadful, but an armoury fit for a baron, to\nwit, a black bear on a castle-wall on a field of gold.\n\nBut as Ralph sat on his horse gazing, himseemed that men were looking\ntowards him, and a great horn was sounded hard by the pavilion; then\nRalph looked toward the minstrel fiercely, and laughed and said:  \"I\nsee now that thou art another traitor: so get thee gone; I have more to\ndo than the slaying of thee.\" And therewith he turned his horse's head,\nand smote the spurs into the sides of him, and went a great gallop over\nthe field on the right side of the road, away from the gay pavilion;\nbut even therewith came a half-score of horsemen from the camp, as if\nthey were awaiting him, and they spurred after him straightway.\n\nThe race was no long one, for Ralph's beast was wearied, and the other\nhorses were fresh, and Ralph knew naught of the country before him,\nwhereas those riders knew it well.  Therefore it was but a few minutes\ntill they came up with him, and he made no show of defence, but\nsuffered them to lead him away, and he crossed the highway, where he\nsaw no token of the minstrel.\n\nSo they brought him to the pavilion, and made him dismount and led him\nin.  The dusk had fallen by now, but within it was all bright with\ncandles.  The pavilion was hung with rich silken cloth, and at the\nfurther end, on a carpet of the hunting, was an ivory chair, whereon\nsat a man, who was the only one sitting.  He was clad in a gown of blue\nsilk, broidered with roundels beaten with the Bear upon the Castle-wall.\n\nRalph deemed that this must be no other than the Lord of Utterbol, yet\nafter all the tales he had heard of that lord, he seemed no such\nterrible man:  he was short of stature, but broad across the shoulders,\nhis hair long, strait, and dark brown of hue, and his beard scanty: he\nwas straight-featured and smooth-faced, and had been no ill-looking\nman, save that his skin was sallow and for his eyes, which were brown,\nsmall, and somewhat bloodshot.\n\nBeside him stood Morfinn bowed down with fear and not daring to look\neither at the Lord or at Ralph.  Wherefore he knew for certain that\nwhen he had called him traitor even now, that it was no more than the\nvery sooth, and that he had fallen into the trap; though how or why he\nwotted not clearly.  Well then might his heart have fallen, but so it\nwas, that when he looked into the face of this Lord, the terror of the\nlands, hatred of him so beset his heart that it swallowed up fear in\nhim.  Albeit he held himself well in hand, for his soul was waxing, and\nhe deemed that he should yet do great deeds, therefore he desired to\nlive, whatsoever pains or shame of the passing day he might suffer.\n\nNow this mighty lord spake, and his voice was harsh and squeaking, so\nthat the sound of it was worse than the sight of his face; and he said:\n\"Bring the man forth, that I may see him.\" So they brought up Ralph,\ntill he was eye to eye with the Lord, who turned to Morfinn and said:\n\"Is this thy catch, lucky man?\" \"Yea,\" quavered Morfinn, not lifting\nhis eyes; \"Will he do, lord?\"\n\n\"Do?\" said the lord, \"How can I see him when he is all muffled up in\nsteel?  Ye fools! doff his wargear.\"\n\nSpeedily then had they stripped Ralph of hauberk, and helm, and arm and\nleg plates, so that he stood up in his jerkin and breeches, and the\nlord leaned forward to look on him as if he were cheapening a horse;\nand then turned to a man somewhat stricken in years, clad in scarlet,\nwho stood on his other hand, and said to him: \"Well, David the Sage, is\nthis the sort of man?  Is he goodly enough?\"\n\nThen the elder put on a pair of spectacles and eyed Ralph curiously a\nwhile, and then said:  \"There are no two words to be said about it; he\nis a goodly and well-fashioned a young man as was ever sold.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the lord, turning towards Morfinn, \"the catch is good,\nlucky man:  David will give thee gold for it, and thou mayst go back\nwest when thou wilt.  And thou must be lucky again, moreover; because\nthere are women needed for my house; and they must be goodly and meek,\nand not grievously marked with stripes, or branded, so that thou hadst\nbest take them, luckily if thou mayst, and not buy them.  Now go, for\nthere are more than enough men under this woven roof, and we need no\nhalf-men to boot.\"\n\nSaid David, the old man, grinning:  \"He will hold him well paid if he\ngo unscathed from before thee, lord:  for he looked not to meet thee\nhere, but thought to bring the young man to Utterness, that he might be\nkept there till thou camest.\"\n\nThe lord said, grimly:  \"He is not far wrong to fear me, maybe: but he\nshall go for this time.  But if he bring me not those women within\nthree months' wearing, and if there be but two uncomely ones amongst\nthem, let him look to it.  Give him his gold, David.  Now take ye the\nnew man, and let him rest, and give him meat and drink.  And look you,\nDavid, if he be not in condition when he cometh home to Utterbol, thou\nshalt pay for it in one way or other, if not in thine own person, since\nthou art old, and deft of service, then through those that be dear to\nthee.  Go now!\"\n\nDavid smiled on Ralph and led him out unto a tent not far off, and\nthere he made much of him, and bade bring meat and drink and all he\nneeded.  Withal he bade him not to try fleeing, lest he be slain; and\nhe showed him how nigh the guards were and how many.\n\nGlad was the old man when he saw the captive put a good face on\nmatters, and that he was not down-hearted. In sooth that hatred of the\ntyrant mingled with hope sustained Ralph's heart.  He had been minded\nwhen he was brought before the lord to have shown the letter of the\nQueen of Goldburg, and to defy him if he still held him captive.  But\nwhen he had beheld him and his fellowship a while he thought better of\nit.  For though they had abundance of rich plenishing, and gay raiment,\nand good weapons and armour, howbeit of strange and uncouth fashion,\nyet he deemed when he looked on them that they would scarce have the\nsouls of men in their bodies, but that they were utterly vile through\nand through, like the shapes of an evil dream.  Therefore he thought\nshame of it to show the Queen's letter to them, even as if he had shown\nthem the very naked body of her, who had been so piteous kind to him.\nAlso he had no mind to wear his heart on his sleeve, but would keep his\nown counsel, and let his foemen speak and show what was in their minds.\nFor this cause he now made himself sweet, and was of good cheer with\nold David, deeming him to be a great man there; as indeed he was, being\nthe chief counsellor of the Lord of Utterbol; though forsooth not so\nmuch his counsellor as that he durst counsel otherwise than as the Lord\ndesired to go; unless he thought that it would bring his said Lord, and\ntherefore himself, to very present peril and damage.  In short, though\nthis man had not been bought for money, he was little better than a\nthrall of the higher sort, as forsooth were all the Lord's men, saving\nthe best and trustiest of his warriors: and these were men whom the\nLord somewhat feared himself: though, on the other hand, he could not\nbut know that they understood how the dread of the Lord of Utterbol was\na shield to them, and that if it were to die out amongst men, their own\nskins were not worth many days' purchase.\n\nSo then David spake pleasantly with Ralph, and ate and drank with him,\nand saw that he was well bedded for the night, and left him in the\nfirst watch.  But Ralph lay down in little more trouble than the night\nbefore, when, though he were being led friendly to Utterness, yet he\nhad not been able to think what he should do when he came there:\nwhereas now he thought: Who knoweth what shall betide? and for me there\nis nought to do save to lay hold of the occasion that another may give\nme.  And at the worst I scarce deem that I am being led to the\nslaughter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33\n\nRalph is Brought on the Road Towards Utterbol\n\n\nBut now when it was morning they struck the tents and laded them on\nwains, and went their ways the selfsame road that Ralph had been minded\nfor yesterday; to wit the road to Utterness; but now must he ride it\nunarmed and guarded:  other shame had he none.  Indeed David, who stuck\nclose to his side all day, was so sugary sweet with him, and praised\nand encouraged him so diligently, that Ralph began to have misgivings\nthat all this kindness was but as the flower-garlands wherewith the\nheathen times men were wont to deck the slaughter-beasts for the\nblood-offering. Yea, and into his mind came certain tales of how there\nwere heathen men yet in the world, who beguiled men and women, and\noffered them up to their devils, whom they called gods: but all this\nran off him soon, when he bethought him how little wisdom there was in\nrunning to meet the evil, which might be on the way, and that way a\nrough and perilous one.  So he plucked up heart, and spake freely and\ngaily with David and one or two others who rode anigh.\n\nThey were amidst of the company:  the Lord went first after his\nfore-runners in a litter done about with precious cloths; and two score\nhorsemen came next, fully armed after their manner.  Then rode Ralph\nwith David and a half dozen of the magnates: then came a sort of cooks\nand other serving men, but none without a weapon, and last another\nscore of men-at-arms: so that he saw that fleeing was not to be thought\nof though he was not bound, and save for lack of weapons rode like a\nfree man.\n\nThe day was clear as yesterday had been, wherefore again Ralph saw the\ndistant mountain-top like a cloud; and he gazed at it long till David\nsaid:  \"I see that thou art gazing hard at the mountains, and perchance\nart longing to be beyond them, were it but to see what like the land is\non the further side.  If all tales be true thou art best this side\nthereof, whatever thy lot may be.\"\n\n\"Lieth death on the other side then?\" quoth Ralph.  \"Yea,\" said David,\n\"but that is not all, since he is not asleep elsewhere in the world:\nbut men say that over there are things to be seen which might slay a\nstrong man for pure fear, without stroke of sword or dint of axe.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"but how was it then with him that builded Goldburg?\"\n\n\"O,\" said David, \"hast thou heard that tale?  Well, they say of him,\nwho certes went over those mountains, and drank of the Well at the\nWorld's End, that he was one of the lucky: yet for all his luck never\nhad he drunk the draught had he not been helped by one who had learned\nmany things, a woman to wit.  For he was one of them with whom all\nwomen are in love; and thence indeed was his luck....Moreover, when all\nis said, 'tis but a tale.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth Ralph laughing, \"even as the tales of the ghosts and bugs\nthat abide the wayfarer on the other side of yonder white moveless\ncloud.\"\n\nDavid laughed in his turn and said:  \"Thou hast me there; and whether\nor no, these tales are nothing to us, who shall never leave Utterbol\nagain while we live, save in such a company as this.\" Then he held his\npeace, but presently spake again:  \"Hast thou heard anything, then, of\nthose tales of the Well at the World's End?  I mean others beside that\nconcerning the lord of Goldburg?\"\n\n\"Yea, surely I have,\" said Ralph, nowise changing countenance.  Said\nDavid: \"Deemest thou aught of them? deemest thou that it may be true\nthat a man may drink of the Well and recover his youth thereby?\"\n\nRalph laughed and said:  \"Master, it is rather for me to ask thee\nhereof, than thou me, since thou dwellest so much nigher thereto than I\nhave done heretofore.\"\n\nDavid drew up close to him, and said softly:  \"Nigher?  Yea, but belike\nnot so much nigher.\"\n\n\"How meanest thou?\" said Ralph.\n\nSaid David:  \"Is it so nigh that a man may leave home and come thereto\nin his life-time?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"in my tales it is.\"\n\nSaid the old man still softlier:  \"Had I deemed that true I had tried\nthe adventure, whatever might lie beyond the mountains, but (and he\nsighed withal) I deem it untrue.\"\n\nTherewith dropped the talk of that matter:  and in sooth Ralph was\nloath to make many words thereof, lest his eagerness shine through, and\nall the story of him be known.\n\nAnon it was noon, and the lord bade all men stay for meat: so his\nserving men busied them about his dinner, and David went with them.\nThen the men-at-arms bade Ralph sit among them and share their meat.\nSo they sat down all by the wayside, and they spake kindly and friendly\nto Ralph, and especially their captain, a man somewhat low of stature,\nbut long-armed like the Lord, a man of middle age, beardless and spare\nof body, but wiry and tough-looking, with hair of the hue of the dust\nof the sandstone quarry.  This man fell a-talking with Ralph, and asked\nhim of the manner of tilting and courteous jousting between knights in\nthe countries of knighthood, till that talk dropped between them.  Then\nRalph looked round upon the land, which had now worsened again, and was\nlittle better than rough moorland, little fed, and not at all tilled,\nand he said:  \"This is but a sorry land for earth's increase.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the captain, \"I wot not; it beareth plover and whimbrel\nand conies and hares; yea, and men withal, some few.  And whereas it\nbeareth naught else, that cometh of my lord's will: for deemest thou\nthat he should suffer a rich land betwixt him and Goldburg, that it\nmight sustain an host big enough to deal with him?\"\n\n\"But is not this his land?\" said Ralph.\n\nSaid the captain:  \"Nay, and also yea.  None shall dwell in it save as\nhe willeth, and they shall pay him tribute, be it never so little.  Yet\nsome there are of them, who are to him as the hounds be to the hunter,\nand these same he even wageth, so that if aught rare and goodly cometh\ntheir way they shall bring it to his hands; as thou thyself knowest to\nthy cost.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph smiling, \"and is Morfinn the Unmanned one of these\ncurs?\" \"Yea,\" said the captain, with a grin, \"and one of the richest of\nthem, in despite of his fiddle and minstrel's gear, and his lack of\nmanhood: for he is one of the cunningest of men.  But my Lord unmanned\nhim for some good reason.\"\n\nRalph kept silence and while and then said:  \"Why doth the Goldburg\nfolk suffer all this felony, robbery and confusion, so near their\nborders, and the land debateable?\"\n\nSaid the captain, and again he grinned:  \"Passing for thy hard words,\nsir knight, why dost thou suffer me to lead thee along whither thou\nwouldest not?\"\n\n\"Because I cannot help myself,\" said Ralph.\n\nSaid the captain:  \"Even so it is with the Goldburg folk: if they raise\nhand against some of these strong-thieves or man-stealers, he has but\nto send the war-arrow round about these deserts, as ye deem them, and\nhe will presently have as rough a company of carles for his fellows as\nneed be, say ten hundred of them.  And the Goldburg folk are not very\nhandy at a fray without their walls.  Forsooth within them it is\nanother matter, and beside not even our Lord of Utterbol would see\nGoldburg broken down, no, not for all that he might win there.\"\n\n\"Is it deemed a holy place in the land, then?\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I wot not the meaning of holy,\" said the other:  \"but all we deem that\nwhen Goldburg shall fall, the world shall change, so that living\ntherein shall be hard to them that have not drunk of the water of the\nWell at the World's End.\"\n\nRalph was silent a while and eyed the captain curiously: then he said:\n\"Have the Goldburgers so drunk?\"  Said the captain: \"Nay, nay; but the\nword goes that under each tower of Goldburg lieth a youth and a maiden\nthat have drunk of the water, and might not die save by point and edge.\"\n\nThen was Ralph silent again, for once more he fell pondering the matter\nif he had been led away to be offered as a blood offering to some of\nevil gods of the land.  But as he pondered a flourish of trumpets was\nblown, and all men sprang up, and the captain said to Ralph: \"Now hath\nour Lord done his dinner and we must to horse.\" Anon they were on the\nway again, and they rode long and saw little change in the aspect of\nthe land, neither did that cloudlike token of the distant mountains\ngrow any greater or clearer to Ralph's deeming.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34\n\nThe Lord of Utterbol Will Wot of Ralph's Might and Minstrelsy\n\n\nA little before sunset they made halt for the night, and Ralph was\nshown to a tent as erst, and had meat and drink good enough brought to\nhim.  But somewhat after he had done eating comes David to him and\nsays: \"Up, young man! and come to my lord, he asketh for thee.\"\n\n\"What will he want with me?\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Yea, that is a proper question to ask!\" quoth David; \"as though the\nknife should ask the cutler, what wilt thou cut with me?  Dost thou\ndeem that I durst ask him of his will with thee?\" \"I am ready to go\nwith thee,\" said Ralph.\n\nSo they went forth; but Ralph's heart fell and he sickened at the\nthought of seeing that man again.  Nevertheless he set his face as\nbrass, and thrust back both his fear and his hatred for a fitter\noccasion.\n\nSoon they came into the pavilion of the Lord, who was sitting there as\nyester eve, save that his gown was red, and done about with gold and\nturquoise and emerald.  David brought Ralph nigh to his seat, but spake\nnot.  The mighty lord was sitting with his head drooping, and his arm\nhanging over his knee, with a heavy countenance as though he were\nbrooding matters which pleased him naught.  But in a while he sat up\nwith a start, and turned about and saw David standing there with Ralph,\nand spake at once like a man waking up: \"He that sold thee to me said\nthat thou wert of avail for many things.  Now tell me, what canst thou\ndo?\"\n\nRalph so hated him, that he was of half a mind to answer naught save by\nsmiting him to slay him; but there was no weapon anigh, and life was\nsweet to him with all the tale that was lying ahead.  So he answered\ncoldly:  \"It is sooth, lord, that I can do more than one deed.\"\n\n\"Canst thou back a horse?\" said the Lord.  Said Ralph:  \"As well as\nmany.\" Said the Lord:  \"Canst thou break a wild horse, and shoe him,\nand physic him?\"\n\n\"Not worse than some,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Can'st thou play with sword and spear?\" said the Lord.\n\n\"Better than some few,\" said Ralph.  \"How shall I know that?\" said the\nLord.  Said Ralph:  \"Try me, lord!\"  Indeed, he half hoped that if it\ncame to that, he might escape in the hurley.\n\nThe Lord looked on him and said:  \"Well, it may be tried.  But here is\na cold and proud answerer, David.  I misdoubt me whether it be worth\nwhile bringing him home.\"\n\nDavid looked timidly on Ralph and said:  \"Thou hast paid the price for\nhim, lord.\"\n\n\"Yea, that is true,\" said the Lord.  \"Thou! can'st thou play at the\nchess?\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph.  \"Can'st thou music?\" said the other.\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"when I am merry, or whiles indeed when I am sad.\"\n\nThe lord said:  \"Make thyself merry or sad, which thou wilt; but sing,\nor thou shalt be beaten.  Ho!  Bring ye the harp.\" Then they brought it\nas he bade.\n\nBut Ralph looked to right and left and saw no deliverance, and knew\nthis for the first hour of his thralldom.  Yet, as he thought of it\nall, he remembered that if he would do, he must needs bear and forbear;\nand his face cleared, and he looked round about again and let his eyes\nrest calmly on all eyes that he met till they came on the Lord's face\nagain.  Then he let his hand fall into the strings and they fell\na-tinkling sweetly, like unto the song of the winter robin, and at last\nhe lifted his voice and sang:\n\n    Still now is the stithy this morning unclouded,\n    Nought stirs in the thorp save the yellow-haired maid\n    A-peeling the withy last Candlemas shrouded\n    From the mere where the moorhen now swims unafraid.\n\n    For over the Ford now the grass and the clover\n    Fly off from the tines as the wind driveth on;\n    And soon round the Sword-howe the swathe shall lie over,\n    And to-morrow at even the mead shall be won.\n\n    But the Hall of the Garden amidst the hot morning,\n    It drew my feet thither; I stood at the door,\n    And felt my heart harden 'gainst wisdom and warning\n    As the sun and my footsteps came on to the floor.\n\n    When the sun lay behind me, there scarce in the dimness\n    I say what I sought for, yet trembled to find;\n    But it came forth to find me, until the sleek slimness\n    Of the summer-clad woman made summer o'er kind.\n\n    There we the once-sundered together were blended,\n    We strangers, unknown once, were hidden by naught.\n    I kissed and I wondered how doubt was all ended,\n    How friendly her excellent fairness was wrought.\n\n    Round the hall of the Garden the hot sun is burning,\n    But no master nor minstrel goes there in the shade,\n    It hath never a warden till comes the returning,\n    When the moon shall hang high and all winds shall be laid.\n\n    Waned the day and I hied me afield, and thereafter\n    I sat with the mighty when daylight was done,\n    But with great men beside me, midst high-hearted laughter,\n    I deemed me of all men the gainfullest one.\n\n    To wisdom I hearkened; for there the wise father\n    Cast the seed of his learning abroad o'er the hall,\n\n    Till men's faces darkened, but mine gladdened rather\n    With the thought of the knowledge I knew over all.\n\n    Sang minstrels the story, and with the song's welling\n    Men looked on each other and glad were they grown,\n    But mine was the glory of the tale and its telling\n    How the loved and the lover were naught but mine own.\n\n    When he was done all kept silence till they should know whether\n    the lord should praise the song or blame; and he said naught\n    for a good while, but sat as if pondering:  but at last he spake:\n    \"Thou art young, and would that we were young also!\n    Thy song is sweet, and it pleaseth me, who am a man of war,\n    and have seen enough and to spare of rough work, and would\n    any day rather see a fair woman than a band of spears.\n    But it shall please my lady wife less:  for of love, and fair women,\n    and their lovers she hath seen enough; but of war nothing save\n    its shows and pomps; wherefore she desireth to hear thereof.\n    Now sing of battle!\"\n\nRalph thought awhile and began to smite the harp while he conned over a\nsong which he had learned one yule-tide from a chieftain who had come\nto Upmeads from the far-away Northland, and had abided there till\nspring was waning into summer, and meanwhile he taught Ralph this song\nand many things else, and his name was Sir Karr Wood-neb. This song now\nRalph sang loud and sweet, though he were now a thrall in an alien land:\n\n\n    Leave we the cup!\n    For the moon is up,\n    And bright is the gleam\n    Of the rippling stream,\n    That runneth his road\n    To the old abode,\n    Where the walls are white\n    In the moon and the night;\n    The house of the neighbour that drave us away\n    When strife ended labour amidst of the hay,\n    And no road for our riding was left us but one\n    Where the hill's brow is hiding that earth's ways are done,\n    And the sound of the billows comes up at the last\n    Like the wind in the willows ere autumn is past.\n\n    But oft and again\n    Comes the ship from the main,\n    And we came once more\n    And no lading we bore\n    But the point and the edge,\n    And the ironed ledge,\n    And the bolt and the bow,\n    And the bane of the foe.\n    To the House 'neath the mountain we came in the morn,\n    Where welleth the fountain up over the corn,\n    And the stream is a-running fast on to the House\n    Of the neighbours uncunning who quake at the mouse,\n    As their slumber is broken; they know not for why;\n    Since yestreen was not token on earth or in sky.\n\n    Come, up, then up!\n    Leave board and cup,\n    And follow the gleam\n    Of the glittering stream\n    That leadeth the road To the old abode,\n    High-walled and white\n    In the moon and the night;\n    Where low lies the neighbour that drave us away\n    Sleep-sunk from his labour amidst of the hay.\n    No road for our riding is left us save one,\n    Where the hills' brow is hiding the city undone,\n    And the wind in the willows is with us at last,\n    And the house of the billows is done and o'er-past.\n\n    Haste! mount and haste\n    Ere the short night waste,\n    For night and day,\n    Late turned away,\n    Draw nigh again\n    All kissing-fain;\n    And the morn and the moon\n    Shall be married full soon.\n    So ride we together with wealth-winning wand,\n    The steel o'er the leather, the ash in the hand.\n    Lo! white walls before us, and high are they built;\n    But the luck that outwore us now lies on their guilt;\n    Lo! the open gate biding the first of the sun,\n    And to peace are we riding when slaughter is done.\n\n\nWhen Ralph had done singing, all folk fell to praising his song,\nwhereas the Lord had praised the other one; but the Lord said, looking\nat Ralph askance meanwhile:  \"Yea, if that pleaseth me not, and I take\nbut little keep of it, it shall please my wife to her heart's root; and\nthat is the first thing.  Hast thou others good store, new-comer?\"\n\"Yea, lord,\" said Ralph.  \"And canst thou tell tales of yore agone, and\nof the fays and such-like? All that she must have.\" \"Some deal I can of\nthat lore,\" said Ralph.\n\nThen the Lord sat silent, and seemed to be pondering: at last he said,\nas if to himself:  \"Yet there is one thing: many a blencher can sing of\nbattle; and it hath been seen, that a fair body of a man is whiles soft\namidst the hard hand-play. Thou!  Morfinn's luck! art thou of any use\nin the tilt-yard?\" \"Wilt thou try me, lord?\" said Ralph, looking\nsomewhat brisker.  Said the Lord:  \"I deem that I may find a man or two\nfor thee, though it is not much our manner here; but now go thou!\nDavid, take the lad away to his tent, and get him a flask of wine of\nthe best to help out thy maundering with him.\"\n\nTherewith they left the tent, and Ralph walked by David sadly and with\nhanging head at first; but in a while he called to mind that, whatever\nbetid, his life was safe as yet; that every day he was drawing nigher\nto the Well at the World's End; and that it was most like that he shall\nfall in with that Dorothea of his dream somewhere on the way thereto.\nSo he lifted up his head again, and was singing to himself as he\nstooped down to enter into his tent.\n\nNext day naught happed to tell of save that they journeyed on; the day\nwas cloudy, so that Ralph saw no sign of the distant mountains; ever\nthe land was the same, but belike somewhat more beset with pinewoods;\nthey saw no folk at all on the road.  So at even Ralph slept in his\ntent, and none meddled with him, save that David came to talk with him\nor he slept, and was merry and blithe with him, and he brought with him\nOtter, the captain of the guard, who was good company.\n\nThus wore three days that were hazy and cloudy, and the Lord sent no\nmore for Ralph, who on the road spake for the more part with Otter, and\nliked him not ill; howbeit it seemed of him that he would make no more\nof a man's life than of a rabbit's according as his lord might bid slay\nor let live.\n\nThe three hazy days past, it fell to rain for four days, so that Ralph\ncould see little of the face of the land; but he noted that they went\nup at whiles, and never so much down as up, so that they were wending\nup hill on the whole.\n\nOn the ninth day of his captivity the rain ceased and it was sunny and\nwarm but somewhat hazy, so that naught could be seen afar, but the land\nnear-hand rose in long, low downs now, and was quite treeless, save\nwhere was a hollow here and there and a stream running through it,\nwhere grew a few willows, but alders more abundantly.\n\nThis day he rode by Otter, who said presently: \"Well, youngling of the\nNorth, to-morrow we shall see a new game, thou and I, if the weather be\nfair.\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and what like shall it be?\"  Said Otter, \"At\nmid-morn we shall come into a fair dale amidst the downs, where be some\nhouses and a tower of the Lord's, so that that place is called the Dale\nof the Tower:  there shall we abide a while to gather victual, a day or\ntwo, or three maybe: so my Lord will hold a tourney there:  that is to\nsay that I myself and some few others shall try thy manhood somewhat.\"\n\"What?\" said Ralph, \"are the new colt's paces to be proven?  And how if\nhe fail?\"\n\nQuoth Otter, laughing:  \"Fail not, I rede thee, or my lord's love for\nthee shall be something less than nothing.\" \"And then will he slay me?\"\nsaid Ralph.  Said Otter: \"Nay I deem not, at least not at first:  he\nwill have thee home to Utterbol, to make the most of his bad bargain,\nand there shalt thou be a mere serving-thrall, either in the house or\nthe field: where thou shalt be well-fed (save in times of scarcity),\nand belike well beaten withal.\"  Said Ralph, somewhat downcast: \"Yea, I\nam a thrall, who was once a knight.  But how if thou fail before me?\"\nOtter laughed again:  \"That is another matter; whatever I do my Lord\nwill not lose me if he can help it; but as for the others who shall\nstand before thy valiancy, there will be some who will curse the day\nwhereon my lord bought thee, if thou turnest out a good spear, as ye\ncall it in your lands.  Howsoever, that is not thy business; and I bid\nthee fear naught; for thou seemest to be a mettle lad.\"\n\nSo they talked, and that day wore like the others, but the haze did not\nclear off, and the sun went down red.  In the evening David talked with\nRalph in his tent, and said: \"If to-morrow be clear, knight, thou shalt\nsee a new sight when thou comest out from the canvas.\"  Said Ralph:  \"I\nsuppose thy meaning is that we shall see the mountains from hence?\"\n\"Yea,\" said David; \"so hold up thine heart when that sight first cometh\nbefore thine eyes.  As for us, we are used to the sight, and that from\na place much nigher to the mountains: yet they who are soft-hearted\namongst us are overcome at whiles, when there is storm and tempest, and\nevil tides at hand.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"And how far then are we from Utterbol?\"  Said David:\n\"After we have left Bull-mead in the Dale of the Tower, where to-morrow\nthou art to run with the spear, it is four days' ride to Utterness; and\nfrom Utterness ye may come (if my lord will) unto Utterbol in twelve\nhours.  But tell me, knight, how deemest thou of thy tilting\nto-morrow?\" Said Ralph:  \"Little should I think of it, if little lay\nupon it.\" \"Yea,\" said David, \"but art thou a good tilter?\"  Ralph\nlaughed: quoth he, \"That hangs on the goodness of him that tilteth\nagainst me: I have both overthrown, and been overthrown oft enough.\nYet again, who shall judge me? for I must tell thee, that were I fairly\njudged, I should be deemed no ill spear, even when I came not\nuppermost: for in all these games are haps which no man may foresee.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said David, \"all will go well with thee for this time:\nfor my lord will judge thee, and if it be seen that thou hast spoken\ntruly, and art more than a little deft at the play, he will be like to\nmake the best of thee, since thou art already paid for.\" Ralph laughed:\nyet as though the jest pleased him but little; and they fell to talk of\nother matters.  And so David departed, and Ralph slept.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35\n\nRalph Cometh To the Vale of the Tower\n\n\nBut when it was morning Ralph awoke, and saw that the sun was shining\nbrightly; so he cast his shirt on him, and went out at once, and turned\nhis face eastward, and, scarce awake, said to himself that the clouds\nlay heavy in the eastward heavens after last night's haze: but\npresently his eyes cleared, and he saw that what he had taken for\nclouds was a huge wall of mountains, black and terrible, that rose up\nsharp and clear into the morning air; for there was neither cloud nor\nmist in all the heavens.\n\nNow Ralph, though he were but little used to the sight of great\nmountains, yet felt his heart rather rise than fall at the sight of\nthem; for he said: \"Surely beyond them lieth some new thing for me,\nlife or death: fair fame or the forgetting of all men.\"  And it was\nlong that he could not take his eyes off them.\n\nAs he looked, came up the Captain Otter, and said:  \"Well, Knight, thou\nhast seen them this morn, even if ye die ere nightfall.\" Said Ralph:\n\"What deemest thou to lie beyond them?\"\n\n\"Of us none knoweth surely,\" said Otter; \"whiles I deem that if one\nwere to get to the other side there would be a great plain like to\nthis:  whiles that there is naught save mountains beyond, and yet again\nmountains, like the waves of a huge stone sea.  Or whiles I think that\none would come to an end of the world, to a place where is naught but a\nledge, and then below it a gulf filled with nothing but the howling of\nwinds, and the depth of darkness.  Moreover this is my thought, that\nall we of these parts should be milder men and of better conditions, if\nyonder terrible wall were away.  It is as if we were thralls of the\ngreat mountains.\"\n\nSaid Ralph, \"Is this then the Wall of the World?\" \"It may well be so,\"\nsaid Otter; \"but this word is at whiles said of something else, which\nno man alive amongst us has yet seen.  It is a part of the tale of the\nseekers for the Well at the World's End, whereof we said a word that\nother day.\"\n\n\"And the Dry Tree,\" said Ralph, \"knowest thou thereof?\" said Ralph.\n\"Such a tree, much beworshipped,\" said Otter, \"we have, not very far\nfrom Utterbol, on the hither side of the mountains.  Yet I have heard\nold men say that it is but a toy, and an image of that which is verily\nanigh the Well at the World's End.  But now haste thee to do on thy\nraiment, for we must needs get to horse in a little while.\"  \"Yet one\nmore word,\" said Ralph; \"thou sayest that none alive amongst you have\nseen the Wall of the World?\"  \"None alive,\" quoth Otter; \"forsooth what\nthe dead may see, that is another question.\" Said Ralph:  \"But have ye\nnot known of any who have sought to the Well from this land, which is\nso nigh thereunto?\" \"Such there have been,\" said Otter; \"but if they\nfound it, they found something beyond it, or came west again by some\nway else than by Utterbol; for they never came back again to us.\"\n\nTherewith he turned on his heel, and went his ways, and up came David\nand one with him bringing victual; and David said:  \"Now, thou lucky\none, here is come thy breakfast! for we shall presently be on our way.\nCast on thy raiment, and eat and strengthen thyself for the day's work.\nHast thou looked well on the mountains?\"  \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and the\nsight of them has made me as little downhearted as thou art.  For thou\nart joyous of mood this morning.\"  David nodded and smiled, and looked\nso merry that Ralph wondered what was toward.  Then he went into his\ntent and clad himself, and ate his breakfast, and then gat to horse and\nrode betwixt two of the men-at-arms, he and Otter; for David was ridden\nforward to speak with the Lord.  Otter talked ever gaily enough; but\nRalph heeded him little a while, but had his eyes ever on the\nmountains, and could see that for all they were so dark, and filled up\nso much of the eastward heaven, they were so far away that he could see\nbut little of them save that they were dark blue and huge, and one\nrising up behind the other.\n\nThus they rode the down country, till at last, two hours before noon,\ncoming over the brow of a long down, they had before them a shallow\ndale, pleasanter than aught they had yet seen.  It was well-grassed,\nand a little river ran through it, from which went narrow leats held up\nby hatches, so that the more part of the valley bottom was a\nwater-meadow, wherein as now were grazing many kine and sheep.  There\nwere willows about the banks of the river, and in an ingle of it stood\na grange or homestead, with many roofs half hidden by clumps of tall\nold elm trees.  Other houses there were in the vale; two or three cots,\nto wit, on the slope of the hither down, and some half-dozen about the\nhomestead; and above and beyond all these, on a mound somewhat away\nfrom the river and the grange, a great square tower, with barriers and\nbailey all dight ready for war, and with a banner of the Lord's hanging\nout.  But between the tower and the river stood as now a great pavilion\nof snow-white cloth striped with gold and purple; and round about it\nwere other tents, as though a little army were come into the vale.\n\nSo when they looked into that fair place, Otter the Captain rose in the\nstirrups and cast up his hand for joy, and cried out aloud:  \"Now,\nyoung knight, now we are come home: how likest thou my Lord's land?\"\n\n\"It is a fair land,\" said Ralph; \"but is there not come some one to bid\nthy Lord battle for it? or what mean the tents down yonder?\"\n\nSaid Otter, laughing:  \"Nay, nay, it hath not come to that yet.  Yonder\nis my Lord's lady-wife, who hath come to meet him, but in love, so to\nsay, not in battle--not yet.  Though I say not that the cup of love\nbetwixt them be brim-full. But this it behoveth me not to speak of,\nthough thou art to be my brother-in-arms, since we are to tilt together\npresently: for lo! yonder the tilt-yard, my lad.\"\n\nTherewith he pointed to the broad green meadow:  but Ralph said: \"How\ncanst thou, a free man, be brother-in-arms to a thrall?\" \"Nay, lad,\"\nquoth Otter, \"let not that wasp sting thee: for even such was I, time\nwas.  Nay, such am I now, but that a certain habit of keeping my wits\nin a fray maketh me of avail to my Lord, so that I am well looked to.\nForsooth in my Lord's land the free men are of little account, since\nthey must oftenest do as my Lord and my Lord's thralls bid them.\nTruly, brother, it is we who have the wits and the luck to rise above\nthe whipping-post and the shackles that are the great men hereabouts.\nI say we, for I deem that thou wilt do no less, whereas thou hast the\nlucky look in thine eyes.  So let to-day try it.\"\n\nAs he spake came many glittering figures from out of those tents, and\ntherewithal arose the sound of horns and clashing of cymbals, and their\nown horns gave back the sound of welcome.  Then Ralph saw a man in\ngolden armour of strange, outlandish fashion, sitting on a great black\nhorse beside the Lord's litter; and Otter said:  \"Lo! my Lord, armed\nand a-horseback to meet my lady: she looketh kinder on him thus; though\nin thine ear be it said, he is no great man of war; nor need he be,\nsince he hath us for his shield and his hauberk.\"\n\nHerewith were they come on to the causeway above the green meadows, and\npresently drew rein before the pavilion, and stood about in a half-ring\nfacing a two score of gaily clad men-at-arms, who had come with the\nLady and a rout of folk of the household.  Then the Lord gat off his\nhorse, and stood in his golden armour, and all the horns and other\nmusic struck up, and forth from the pavilion came the Lady with a\nhalf-score of her women clad gaily in silken gowns of green, and blue,\nand yellow, broidered all about with gold and silver, but with naked\nfeet, and having iron rings on their arms, so that Ralph saw that they\nwere thralls.  Something told him that his damsel should be amongst\nthese, so he gazed hard on them, but though they were goodly enough\nthere was none of them like to her.\n\nAs to the Queen, she was clad all in fine linen and gold, with gold\nshoes on her feet:  her arms came bare from out of the linen: great\nthey were, and the hands not small; but the arms round and fair, and\nthe hands shapely, and all very white and rosy: her hair was as yellow\nas any that can be seen, and it was plenteous, and shed all down about\nher.  Her eyes were blue and set wide apart, her nose a little snubbed,\nher mouth wide, full-lipped and smiling.  She was very tall, a full\nhalf-head taller than any of her women: yea, as tall as a man who is\nabove the middle height of men.\n\nNow she came forward hastily with long strides, and knelt adown before\nthe Lord, but even as she kneeled looked round with a laughing face.\nThe Lord stooped down to her and took her by both hands, and raised her\nup, and kissed her on the cheek (and he looked but little and of no\npresence beside her:) and he said:  \"Hail to thee, my Lady; thou art\ncome far from thine home to meet me, and I thank thee therefor.  Is it\nwell with our House?\"\n\nShe spake seeming carelessly and loud; but her voice was somewhat\nhusky: \"Yea, my Lord, all is well; few have done amiss, and the harvest\nis plenteous.\"  As she spake the Lord looked with knit brows at the\ndamsels behind her, as if he were seeking something; and the Lady\nfollowed his eyes, smiling a little and flushing as if with merriment.\n\nBut the Lord was silent a while, and then let his brow clear and said:\n\"Yea, Lady, thou art thanked for coming to meet us; and timely is thy\ncoming, since there is game and glee for thee at hand; I have cheapened\na likely thrall of Morfinn the Unmanned, and he is a gift to thee; and\nhe hath given out that he is no ill player with the spear after the\nfashion of them of the west; and we are going to prove his word here in\nthis meadow presently.\"\n\nThe Lady's face grew glad, and she said, looking toward the ring of new\ncomers:  \"Yea, Lord, and which of these is he, if he be here?\"\n\nThe Lord turned a little to point out Ralph, but even therewith the\nLady's eyes met Ralph's, who reddened for shame of being so shown to a\ngreat lady; but as for her she flushed bright red all over her face and\neven to her bosom, and trouble came into her eyes, and she looked\nadown.  But the Lord said: \"Yonder is the youngling, the swordless one\nin the green coat; a likely lad, if he hath not lied about his prowess;\nand he can sing thee a song withal, and tell a piteous tale of old, and\ndo all that those who be reared in the lineages of the westlands deem\nmeet and due for men of knightly blood.  Dost thou like the looks of\nhim, lady! wilt thou have him?\"\n\nThe Lady still held her head down, and tormented the grass with her\nfoot, and murmured somewhat; for she could not come to herself again as\nyet.  So the Lord looked sharply on her and said:  \"Well, when this\ntilting is over, thou shalt tell me thy mind of him; for if he turn out\na dastard I would not ask thee to take him.\"\n\nNow the lady lifted up her face, and she was grown somewhat pale; but\nshe forced her speech to come, and said:  \"It is well, Lord, but now\ncome thou into my pavilion, for thy meat is ready, and it lacketh but a\nminute or so of noon.\"  So he took her hand and led her in to the\npavilion, and all men got off their horses, and fell to pitching the\ntents and getting their meat ready; but Otter drew Ralph apart into a\nnook of the homestead, and there they ate their meat together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 36\n\nThe Talk of Two Women Concerning Ralph\n\n\nBut when dinner was done, came David and a man with him bringing\nRalph's war gear, and bade him do it on, while the folk were fencing\nthe lists, which they were doing with such stuff as they had at the\nTower; and the Lord had been calling for Otter that he might command\nhim what he should tell to the marshals of the lists and how all should\nbe duly ordered, wherefore he went up unto the Tower whither the Lord\nhad now gone.  So Ralph did on his armour, which was not right meet for\ntilting, being over light for such work; and his shield in especial was\nbut a target for a sergeant, which he had brought at Cheaping Knowe;\nbut he deemed that his deftness and much use should bear him well\nthrough.\n\nNow, the Lady had abided in her pavilion when her Lord went abroad;\nanon after she sent all her women away, save one whom she loved, and to\nwhom she was wont to tell the innermost of her mind; though forsooth\nshe mishandled her at whiles; for she was hot of temper, and over-ready\nwith her hands when she was angry; though she was nowise cruel.  But\nthe woman aforesaid, who was sly and sleek, and somewhat past her first\nyouth, took both her caresses and her buffets with patience, for the\nsake of the gifts and largesse wherewith they were bought.  So now she\nstood by the board in the pavilion with her head drooping humbly, yet\nsmiling to herself and heedful of whatso might betide.  But the Lady\nwalked up and down the pavilion hastily, as one much moved.\n\nAt last she spake as she walked and said:  \"Agatha, didst thou see him\nwhen my Lord pointed him out?\"  \"Yea,\" said the woman lifting her face\na little.\n\n\"And what seemed he to thee?\" said the Lady.  \"O my Lady,\" quoth\nAgatha, \"what seemed he to thee?\"  The lady stood and turned and looked\nat her; she was slender and dark and sleek; and though her lips moved\nnot, and her eyes did not change, a smile seemed to steal over her face\nwhether she would or not.  The Lady stamped her foot and lifted her\nhand and cried out.  \"What! dost thou deem thyself meet for him?\" And\nshe caught her by the folds over her bosom.  But Agatha looked up into\nher face with a simple smile as of a child: \"Dost thou deem him meet\nfor thee, my Lady--he a thrall, and thou so great?\"  The Lady took her\nhand from her, but her face flamed with anger and she stamped on the\nground again: \"What dost thou mean?\" she said; \"am I not great enough\nto have what I want when it lieth close to my hand?\" Agatha looked on\nher sweetly, and said in a soft voice: \"Stretch out thine hand for it\nthen.\"  The Lady looked at her grimly, and said:  \"I understand thy\njeer; thou meanest that he will not be moved by me, he being so fair,\nand I being but somewhat fair.  Wilt thou have me beat thee?  Nay, I\nwill send thee to the White Pillar when we come home to Utterbol.\"\n\nThe woman smiled again, and said:  \"My Lady, when thou hast sent me to\nthe White Pillar, or the Red, or the Black, my stripes will not mend\nthe matter for thee, or quench the fear of thine heart that by this\ntime, since he is a grown man, he loveth some other.  Yet belike he\nwill obey thee if thou command, even to the lying in the same bed with\nthee; for he is a thrall.\" The Lady hung her head, but Agatha went on\nin her sweet clear voice: \"The Lord will think little of it, and say\nnothing of it unless thou anger him otherwise; or unless, indeed, he be\nminded to pick a quarrel with thee, and hath baited a trap with this\nstripling.  But that is all unlike:  thou knowest why, and how that he\nloveth the little finger of that new-come thrall of his (whom ye left\nat home at Utterbol in his despite), better than all thy body, for all\nthy white skin and lovely limbs.  Nay, now I think of it, I deem that\nhe meaneth this gift to make an occasion for the staying of any quarrel\nwith thee, that he may stop thy mouth from crying out at him--well,\nwhat wilt thou do? he is a mighty Lord.\"\n\nThe Lady looked up (for she had hung her head at first), her face all\nred with shame, yet smiling, though ruefully, and she said: \"Well, thou\nart determined that if thou art punished it shall not be for naught.\nBut thou knowest not my mind.\" \"Yea, Lady,\" said Agatha, smiling in\ndespite of herself, \"that may well be.\"\n\nNow the Lady turned from her, and went and sat upon a stool that was\nthereby, and said nothing a while; only covering her face with her\nhands and rocking herself to and fro, while Agatha stood looking at\nher.  At last she said: \"Hearken, Agatha, I must tell thee what lieth\nin mine heart, though thou hast been unkind to me and hast tried to\nhurt my soul.  Now, thou art self-willed, and hot-blooded, and not\nunlovely, so that thou mayst have loved and been loved ere now.  But\nthou art so wily and subtle that mayhappen thou wilt not understand\nwhat I mean, when I say that love of this young man hath suddenly\nentered into my heart, so that I long for him more this minute than I\ndid the last, and the next minute shall long still more.  And I long\nfor him to love me, and not alone to pleasure me.\"\n\n\"Mayhappen it will so betide without any pushing the matter,\" said\nAgatha.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Lady, \"Nay; my heart tells me that it will not be so;\nfor I have seen him, that he is of higher kind than we be; as if he\nwere a god come down to us, who if he might not cast his love upon a\ngoddess, would disdain to love an earthly woman, little-minded and in\nwhom perfection is not.\"  Therewith the tears began to run from her\neyes; but Agatha looked on her with a subtle smile and said:  \"O my\nLady!  and thou hast scarce seen him!  And yet I will not say but that\nI understand this.  But as to the matter of a goddess, I know not.\nMany would say that thou sitting on thine ivory chair in thy golden\nraiment, with thy fair bosom and white arms and yellow hair, wert not\nill done for the image of a goddess; and this young man may well think\nso of thee.  However that may be, there is something else I will say to\nthee; (and thou knowest that I speak the truth to thee--most often--\nthough I be wily). This is the word, that although thou hast time and\nagain treated me like the thrall I am, I deem thee no ill woman, but\nrather something overgood for Utterbol and the dark lord thereof.\"\n\nNow sat the Lady shaken with sobs, and weeping without stint; but she\nlooked up at that word and said:  \"Nay, nay, Agatha, it is not so.\nTo-day hath this man's eyes been a candle to me, that I may see myself\ntruly; and I know that though I am a queen and not uncomely, I am but\ncoarse and little-minded. I rage in my household when the whim takes\nme, and I am hot-headed, and masterful, and slothful, and should belike\nbe untrue if there were any force to drive me thereto.  And I suffer my\nhusband to go after other women, and this new thrall is especial, so\nthat I may take my pleasure unstayed with other men whom I love not\ngreatly.  Yes, I am foolish, and empty-headed, and unclean.  And all\nthis he will see through my queenly state, and my golden gown, and my\nwhite skin withal.\"\n\nAgatha looked on her curiously, but smiling no more.  At last she said:\n\"What is to do, then? or must I think of something for thee?\"\n\n\"I know not, I know not,\" said the Lady between her sobs; \"yet if I\nmight be in such case that he might pity me; belike it might blind his\neyes to the ill part of me.  Yea,\" she said, rising up and falling\nwalking to and fro swiftly, \"if he might hurt me and wound me himself,\nand I so loving him.\"\n\nSaid Agatha coldly:  \"Yes, Lady, I am not wily for naught; and I both\ndeem that I know what is in thine heart, and that it is good for\nsomething; and moreover that I may help thee somewhat therein.  So in a\nfew days thou shalt see whether I am worth something more than hard\nwords and beating.  Only thou must promise in all wise to obey me,\nthough I be the thrall, and thou the Lady, and to leave all the whole\nmatter in my hands.\"\n\nQuoth the Lady:  \"That is easy to promise; for what may I do by myself?\"\n\nThen Agatha fell pondering a while, and said thereafter: \"First, thou\nshalt get me speech with my Lord, and cause him to swear immunity to\nme, whatsoever I shall say or do herein.\" Said the Lady:  \"Easy is\nthis.  What more hast thou?\"\n\nSaid Agatha:  \"It were better for thee not to go forth to see the\njousting; because thou art not to be trusted that thou show not thy\nlove openly when the youngling is in peril; and if thou put thy lord to\nshame openly before the people, he must needs thwart thy will, and be\nfierce and cruel, and then it will go hard with thy darling.  So thou\nshalt not go from the pavilion till the night is dark, and thou mayst\nfeign thyself sick meantime.\"\n\n\"Sick enough shall I be if I may not go forth to see how my love is\nfaring in his peril:  this at least is hard to me; but so be it!  At\nleast thou wilt come and tell me how he speedeth.\" \"Oh yes,\" said\nAgatha, \"if thou must have it so; but fear thou not, he shall do well\nenough.\"\n\nSaid the Lady:  \"Ah, but thou wottest how oft it goes with a chance\nstroke, that the point pierceth where it should not; nay, where by\nlikelihood it could not.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Agatha, \"what chance is there in this, when the youngling\nknoweth the whole manner of the play, and his foemen know naught\nthereof?  It is as the chance betwixt Geoffrey the Minstrel and Black\nAnselm, when they play at chess together, that Anselm must needs be\nmated ere he hath time to think of his fourth move.  I wot of these\nmatters, my Lady.  Now, further, I would have thy leave to marshal thy\nmaids about the seat where thou shouldest be, and moreover there should\nbe someone in thy seat, even if I sat in it myself.\"  Said the Lady:\n\"Yea, sit there if thou wilt.\"\n\n\"Woe's me!\" said Agatha laughing, \"why should I sit there?  I am like\nto thee, am I not?\"  \"Yea,\" said the Lady, \"as the swan is like to the\nloon.\"  \"Yea, my Lady,\" said Agatha, \"which is the swan and which the\nloon?  Well, well, fear not; I shall set Joyce in thy seat by my Lord's\nleave; she is tall and fair, and forsooth somewhat like to thee.\" \"Why\nwilt thou do this?\" quoth the Lady; \"Why should thralls sit in my\nseat?\"  Said Agatha:  \"O, the tale is long to tell; but I would confuse\nthat young man's memory of thee somewhat, if his eyes fell on thee at\nall when ye met e'en now, which is to be doubted.\"\n\nThe Lady started up in sudden wrath, and cried out: \"She had best not\nbe too like to me then, and strive to draw his eyes to her, or I will\nhave her marked for diversity betwixt us.  Take heed, take heed!\"\n\nAgatha looked softly on her and said:  \"My Lady.  Ye fair-skinned,\nopen-faced women should look to it not to show yourselves angry before\nmen-folk. For open wrath marreth your beauty sorely.  Leave scowls and\nfury to the dark-browed, who can use them without wrying their faces\nlike a three months' baby with the colic.  Now that is my last rede as\nnow.  For methinks I can hear the trumpets blowing for the arraying of\nthe tourney.  Wherefore I must go to see to matters, while thou hast\nbut to be quiet.  And to-night make much of my Lord, and bid him see me\nto-morrow, and give heed to what I shall say to him.  But if I meet him\nwithout, now, as is most like, I shall bid him in to thee, that thou\nmayst tell him of Joyce, and her sitting in thy seat.  Otherwise I will\ntell him as soon as he is set down in his place.  Sooth to say, he is\nlittle like to quarrel with either thee or me for setting a fair woman\nother than thee by his side.\"\n\nTherewith she lifted the tent lap and went out, stepping daintily, and\nher slender body swaying like a willow branch, and came at once face to\nface with the Lord of Utterbol, and bowed low and humbly before him,\nthough her face, unseen of him, smiled mockingly.  The Lord looked on\nher greedily, and let his hand and arm go over her shoulder, and about\nher side, and he drew her to him, and kissed her, and said: \"What,\nAgatha! and why art thou not bringing forth thy mistress to us?\" She\nraised her face to him, and murmured softly, as one afraid, but with a\nwheedling smile on her face and in her eyes: \"Nay, my Lord, she will\nabide within to-day, for she is ill at ease; if your grace goeth in,\nshe will tell thee what she will have.\"\n\n\"Agatha,\" quoth he, \"I will hear her, and I will do her pleasure if\nthou ask me so to do.\"  Then Agatha cast down her eyes, and her speech\nwas so low and sweet that it was as the cooing of a dove, as she said:\n\"O my Lord, what is this word of thine?\"\n\nHe kissed her again, and said:  \"Well, well, but dost thou ask it?\" \"O\nyea, yea, my Lord,\" said she.\n\n\"It is done then,\" said the Lord; and he let her go; for he had been\nstroking her arm and shoulder, and she hurried away, laughing inwardly,\nto the Lady's women.  But he went into the pavilion after he had cast\none look at her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 37\n\nHow Ralph Justed With the Aliens\n\n\nMeanwhile Captain Otter had brought Ralph into the staked-out lists,\nwhich, being hastily pitched, were but slenderly done, and now the\nUpmeads stripling stood there beside a good horse which they had\nbrought to him, and Otter had been speaking to him friendly.  But Ralph\nsaw the Lord come forth from the pavilion and take his seat on an ivory\nchair set on a turf ridge close to the stakes of the lists:  for that\nplace was used of custom for such games as they exercised in the lands\nof Utterbol.  Then presently the Lady's women came out of their tents,\nand, being marshalled by Agatha, went into the Queen's pavilion, whence\nthey came forth again presently like a bed of garden flowers moving,\nhaving in the midst of them a woman so fair, and clad so gloriously,\nthat Ralph must needs look on her, though he were some way off, and\ntake note of her beauty.  She went and sat her down beside the Lord,\nand Ralph doubted not that it was the Queen, whom he had but glanced at\nwhen they first made stay before the pavilion.  Sooth to say, Joyce\nbeing well nigh as tall as the Queen, and as white of skin, was\notherwise a far fairer woman.\n\nNow spake Otter to Ralph:  \"I must leave thee here, lad, and go to the\nother side, as I am to run against thee.\"  Said Ralph: \"Art thou to run\nfirst?\"  \"Nay, but rather last,\" said Otter; \"they will try thee first\nwith one of the sergeants, and if he overcome thee, then all is done,\nand thou art in an evil plight.  Otherwise will they find another and\nanother, and at last it will be my turn.  So keep thee well, lad.\"\n\nTherewith he rode away, and there came to Ralph one of the sergeants,\nwho brought him a spear, and bade him to horse.  So Ralph mounted and\ntook the spear in hand; and the sergeant said: \"Thou art to run at\nwhatsoever meeteth thee when thou hast heard the third blast of the\nhorn.  Art thou ready?\"  \"Yea, yea,\" said Ralph; \"but I see that the\nspear-head is not rebated, so that we are to play at sharps.\"\n\n\"Art thou afraid, youngling?\" said the sergeant, who was old and\ncrabbed, \"if that be so, go and tell the Lord: but thou wilt find that\nhe will not have his sport wholly spoiled, but will somehow make a bolt\nor a shaft out of thee.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"I did but jest; I deem myself not so near my death to-day\nas I have been twice this summer or oftener.\" Said the sergeant, \"It is\nill jesting in matters wherein my Lord hath to do.  Now thou hast heard\nmy word: do after it.\"\n\nTherewith he departed, and Ralph laughed and shook the spear aloft, and\ndeemed it not over strong; but he said to himself that the spears of\nthe others would be much the same.\n\nNow the horn blew up thrice, and at the latest blast Ralph pricked\nforth, as one well used to the tilt, but held his horse well in hand;\nand he saw a man come driving against him with his spear in the rest,\nand deemed him right big; but this withal he saw, that the man was ill\narrayed, and was pulling on his horse as one not willing to trust him\nto the rush; and indeed he came on so ill that it was clear that he\nwould never strike Ralph's shield fairly.  So he swerved as they met,\nso that his spear-point was never near to Ralph, who turned his horse\ntoward him a little, and caught his foeman by the gear about his neck,\nand spurred on, so that he dragged him clean out of his saddle, and let\nhim drop, and rode back quietly to his place, and got off his horse to\nsee to his girths; and he heard great laughter rising up from the ring\nof men, and from the women also.  But the Lord of Utterbol cried out:\n\"Bring forth some one who doth not eat my meat for nothing: and set\nthat wretch and dastard aside till the tilting be over, and then he\nshall pay a little for his wasted meat and drink.\"\n\nRalph got into his saddle again, and saw a very big man come forth at\nthe other end of the lists, and wondered if he should be overthrown of\nhim; but noted that his horse seemed not over good.  Then the horn blew\nup and he spurred on, and his foeman met him fairly in the midmost of\nthe lists: yet he laid his spear but ill, and as one who would thrust\nand foin with it rather than letting it drive all it might, so that\nRalph turned the point with his shield that it glanced off, but he\nhimself smote the other full on the shoulder, and the shaft brake, but\nthe point had pierced the man's armour, and the truncheon stuck in the\nwound: yet since the spear was broken he kept his saddle.  The Lord\ncried out, \"Well, Black Anselm, this is better done; yet art thou a big\nman and a well-skilled to be beaten by a stripling.\"\n\nSo the man was helped away and Ralph went back to his place again.\n\nThen another man was gotten to run against Ralph, and it went the\nsame-like way:  for Ralph smote him amidst of the shield, and the spear\nheld, so that he fell floundering off his horse.\n\nSix of the stoutest men of Utterbol did Ralph overthrow or hurt in this\nwise; and then he ran three courses with Otter, and in the first two\neach brake his spear fairly on the other; but in the third Otter smote\nnot Ralph squarely, but Ralph smote full amidst of his shield, and so\ndight him that he well-nigh fell, and could not master his horse, but\nyet just barely kept his saddle.\n\nThen the Lord cried out:  \"Now make we an end of it!  We have no might\nagainst this youngling, man to man: or else would Otter have done it.\nThis comes of learning a craft diligently.\"\n\nSo Ralph got off his horse, and did off his helm and awaited tidings;\nand anon comes to him the surly sergeant, and brought him a cup of\nwine, and said:  \"Youngling, thou art to drink this, and then go to my\nLord; and I deem that thou art in favour with him.  So if thou art not\ntoo great a man, thou mightest put in a word for poor Redhead, that\nfirst man that did so ill.  For my Lord would have him set up, and head\ndown and buttocks aloft, as a target for our bowmen.  And it will be\nhis luck if he be sped with the third shot, and last not out to the\ntwentieth.\"\n\n\"Yea, certes,\" said Ralph, \"I will do no less, even if it anger the\nLord.\"  \"O thou wilt not anger him,\" said the man, \"for I tell thee,\nthou art in favour.  Yea, and for me also thou mightest say a word\nalso, when thou becomest right great; for have I not brought thee a\ngood bowl of wine?\" \"Doubt it not, man,\" said Ralph, \"if I once get\nsafe to Utterbol: weary on it and all its ways!\"  Said the sergeant:\n\"That is an evil wish for one who shall do well at Utterbol.  But come,\ntarry not.\"\n\nSo he brought Ralph to the Lord, who still sat in his chair beside that\nfair woman, and Ralph did obeysance to him; yet he had a sidelong\nglance also for that fair seeming-queen, and deemed her both\nproud-looking, and so white-skinned, that she was a wonder, like the\nqueen of the fays: and it was just this that he had noted of the Queen\nas he stood before her earlier in the day when they first came into the\nvale; therefore he had no doubt of this damsel's queenship.\n\nNow the Lord spake to him and said:  \"Well, youngling, thou hast done\nwell, and better than thy behest:  and since ye have been playing at\nsharps, I deem thou would'st not do ill in battle, if it came to that.\nSo now I am like to make something other of thee than I was minded to\nat first:  for I deem that thou art good enough to be a man.  And if\nthou wilt now ask a boon of me, if it be not over great, I will grant\nit thee.\"\n\nRalph put one knee to the ground, and said:  \"Great Lord, I thank thee:\nbut whereas I am in an alien land and seeking great things, I know of\nno gift which I may take for myself save leave to depart, which I deem\nthou wilt not grant me.  Yet one thing thou mayst do for my asking if\nthou wilt.  If thou be still angry with the carle whom I first\nunhorsed, I pray thee pardon him his ill-luck.\"\n\n\"Ill-luck!\" said the Lord, \"Why, I saw him that he was downright afraid\nof thee.  And if my men are to grow blenchers and soft-hearts what is\nto do then?  But tell me, Otter, what is the name of this carle?\" Said\nOtter, \"Redhead he hight, Lord.\"  Said the Lord:  \"And what like a man\nis he in a fray?\"  \"Naught so ill, Lord,\" said Otter.  \"This time, like\nthe rest of us, he knew not this gear.  It were scarce good to miss him\nat the next pinch.  It were enough if he had the thongs over his back a\nfew dozen times; it will not be the first day of such cheer to him.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said the Lord, \"and what for, Otter, what for?\" \"Because he was\nsomewhat rough-handed, Lord,\" said Otter.  \"Then shall we need him and\nuse him some day.  Let him go scot free and do better another bout.\nThere is thy boon granted for thee, knight; and another day thou mayst\nask something more.  And now shall David have a care of thee.  And when\nwe come to Utterbol we shall see what is to be done with thee.\"\n\nThen Ralph rose up and thanked him, and David came forward, and led him\nto his tent.  And he was wheedling in his ways to him, as if Ralph were\nnow become one who might do him great good if so his will were.\n\nBut the Lord went back again into the Tower.\n\nAs to the Lady, she abode in her pavilion amidst many fears and\ndesires, till Agatha entered and said:  \"My Lady, so far all has gone\nhappily.\" Said the Lady:  \"I deemed from the noise and the cry that he\nwas doing well.  But tell me, how did he?\"  \"My Lady,\" quoth Agatha,\n\"he knocked our folk about well-favouredly, and seemed to think little\nof it.\"\n\n\"And Joyce,\" said the Lady, \"how did she?\"  \"She looked a queen, every\ninch of her, and she is tall,\" said Agatha:  \"soothly some folk stared\non her, but not many knew of her, since she is but new into our house.\nThough it is a matter of course that all save our new-come knight knew\nthat it was not thou that sat there.  And my Lord was well-pleased, and\nnow he hath taken her by the hand and led her into the Tower.\"\n\nThe Lady reddened and scowled, and said:  \"And he... did he come anigh\nher?\" \"O yea,\" said Agatha, \"whereas he stood before my Lord a good\nwhile, and then kneeled to him to pray pardon for one of our men who\nhad done ill in the tilting:  yea, he was nigh enough to her to touch\nher had he dared, and to smell the fragrance of her raiment.  And he\nseemed to think it good to look out of the corners of his eyes at her;\nthough I do not say that she smiled on him.\" The Lady sprang up, her\ncheeks burning, and walked about angrily a while, striving for words,\ntill at last she said:  \"When we come home to Utterbol, my lord will\nsee his new thrall again, and will care for Joyce no whit: then will I\nhave my will of her; and she shall learn, she, whether I am verily the\nleast of women at Utterbol!  Ha! what sayest thou?  Now why wilt thou\nstand and smile on me?--Yea, I know what is in thy thought; and in very\nsooth it is good that the dear youngling hath not seen this new thrall,\nthis Ursula.  Forsooth, I tell thee that if I durst have her in my\nhands I would have a true tale out of her as to why she weareth ever\nthat pair of beads about her neck.\"\n\n\"Now, our Lady,\" said Agatha, \"thou art marring the fairness of thy\nface again.  I bid thee be at peace, for all shall be well, and other\nthan thou deemest.  Tell me, then, didst thou get our Lord to swear\nimmunity for me?\"  Said the Lady: \"Yea, he swore on the edge of the\nsword that thou mightest say what thou wouldst, and neither he nor any\nother should lay hand on thee.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Agatha; \"then will I go to him to-morrow morning, when\nJoyce has gone from him.  But now hold up thine heart, and keep close\nfor these two days that we shall yet abide in Tower Dale: and trust me\nthis very evening I shall begin to set tidings going that shall work\nand grow, and shall one day rejoice thine heart.\"\n\nSo fell the talk betwixt them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 38\n\nA Friend Gives Ralph Warning\n\n\nOn the morrow Ralph wandered about the Dale where he would, and none\nmeddled with him.  And as he walked east along the stream where the\nvalley began to narrow, he saw a man sitting on the bank fishing with\nan angle, and when he drew near, the man turned about, and saw him.\nThen he lays down his angling rod and rises to his feet, and stands\nfacing Ralph, looking sheepish, with his hands hanging down by his\nsides; and Ralph, who was thinking of other folk, wondered what he\nwould.  So he said:  \"Hail, good fellow!  What wouldst thou?\"  Said the\nman: \"I would thank thee.\"  \"What for?\" said Ralph, but as he looked on\nhim he saw that it was Redhead, whose pardon he had won of the Lord\nyesterday; so he held out his hand, and took Redhead's, and smiled\nfriendly on him.  Redhead looked him full in the face, and though he\nwas both big and very rough-looking, he had not altogether the look of\na rascal.\n\nHe said:  \"Fair lord, I would that I might do something for thine\navail, and perchance I may:  but it is hard to do good deeds in Hell,\nespecially for one of its devils.\"\n\n\"Yea, is it so bad as that?\" said Ralph.  \"For thee not yet,\" said\nRedhead, \"but it may come to it.  Hearken, lord, there is none anigh us\nthat I can see, so I will say a word to thee at once.  Later on it may\nbe over late: Go thou not to Utterbol whatever may betide.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"but how if I be taken thither?\"  Quoth Redhead: \"I\ncan see this, that thou art so favoured that thou mayst go whither thou\nwilt about the camp with none to hinder thee.  Therefore it will be\neasy for thee to depart by night and cloud, or in the grey of morning,\nwhen thou comest to a good pass, whereof I will tell thee.  And still I\nsay, go thou not to Utterbol: for thou art over good to be made a devil\nof, like to us, and therefore thou shalt be tormented till thy life is\nspoilt, and by that road shalt thou be sent to heaven.\"\n\n\"But thou saidst even now,\" said Ralph, \"that I was high in the Lord's\ngrace.\"  \"Yea,\" said Redhead, \"that may last till thou hast command to\ndo some dastard's deed and nay-sayest it, as thou wilt: and then\nfarewell to thee; for I know what my Lord meaneth for thee.\" \"Yea,\"\nsaid Ralph, \"and what is that?\"  Said Redhead; \"He hath bought thee to\ngive to his wife for a toy and a minion, and if she like thee, it will\nbe well for a while:  but on the first occasion that serveth him, and\nshe wearieth of thee (for she is a woman like a weather-cock), he will\nlay hand on thee and take the manhood from thee, and let thee drift\nabout Utterbol a mock for all men.  For already at heart he hateth\nthee.\"\n\nRalph stood pondering this word, for somehow it chimed in with the\nthought already in his heart.  Yet how should he not go to Utterbol\nwith the Damsel abiding deliverance of him there: and yet again, if\nthey met there and were espied on, would not that ruin everything for\nher as well as for him?\n\nAt last he said:  \"Good fellow, this may be true, but how shall I know\nit for true before I run the risk of fleeing away, instead of going on\nto Utterbol, whereas folk deem honour awaiteth me.\"\n\nSaid Redhead:  \"There is no honour at Utterbol save for such as are\nunworthy of honour.  But thy risk is as I say, and I shall tell thee\nwhence I had my tale, since I love thee for thy kindness to me, and thy\nmanliness.  It was told me yester-eve by a woman who is in the very\nprivity of the Lady of Utterbol, and is well with the Lord also: and it\njumpeth with mine own thought on the matter; so I bid thee beware: for\nwhat is in me to grieve would be sore grieved wert thou cast away.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ralph, \"let us sit down here on the bank and then tell me\nmore; but go on with thine angling the while, lest any should see us.\"\n\nSo they sat down, and Redhead did as Ralph bade; and he said: \"Lord, I\nhave bidden thee to flee; but this is an ill land to flee from, and\nindeed there is but one pass whereby ye may well get away from this\ncompany betwixt this and Utterbol; and we shall encamp hard by it on\nthe second day of our faring hence.  Yet I must tell thee that it is no\nroad for a dastard; for it leadeth through the forest up into the\nmountains:  yet such as it is, for a man bold and strong like thee, I\nbid thee take it: and I can see to it that leaving this company shall\nbe easy to thee: only thou must make up thy mind speedily, since the\ntime draws so nigh, and when thou art come to Utterbol with all this\nrout, and the house full, and some one or other dogging each footstep\nof thine, fleeing will be another matter.  Now thus it is: on that same\nsecond night, not only is the wood at hand to cover thee, but I shall\nbe chief warder of the side of the camp where thou lodgest, so that I\ncan put thee on the road: and if I were better worth, I would say, take\nme with thee, but as it is, I will not burden thee with that prayer.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"I have had one guide in this country-side and he\nbewrayed me.  This is a matter of life and death, so I will speak out\nand say how am I to know but that thou also art going about to bewray\nme?\"\n\nRedhead lept up to his feet, and roared out:  \"What shall I say?  what\nshall I say?  By the soul of my father I am not bewraying thee.  May\nall the curses of Utterbol be sevenfold heavier on me if I am thy\ntraitor and dastard.\"\n\n\"Softly lad, softly,\" said Ralph, \"lest some one should hear thee.\nContent thee, I must needs believe thee if thou makest so much noise\nabout it.\"\n\nThen Redhead sat him down again, and for all that he was so rough and\nsturdy a carle he fell a-weeping.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Ralph, \"this is worse in all wise than the other\nnoise.  I believe thee as well as a man can who is dealing with one who\nis not his close friend, and who therefore spareth truth to his friend\nbecause of many years use and wont.  Come to thyself again and let us\nlook at this matter square in the face, and speedily too, lest some\nunfriend or busybody come on us.  There now!  Now, in the first place\ndost thou know why I am come into this perilous and tyrannous land?\"\n\nSaid Redhead:  \"I have heard it said that thou art on the quest of the\nWell at the World's End.\"\n\n\"And that is but the sooth,\" said Ralph.  \"Well then,\" quoth Redhead,\n\"there is the greater cause for thy fleeing at the time and in the\nmanner I have bidden thee.  For there is a certain sage who dwelleth in\nthe wildwood betwixt that place and the Great Mountains, and he hath so\nmuch lore concerning the Mountains, yea, and the Well itself, that if\nhe will tell thee what he can tell, thou art in a fair way to end thy\nquest happily.  What sayest thou then?\"\n\nSaid Ralph, \"I say that the Sage is good if I may find him.  But there\nis another cause why I have come hither from Goldburg.\" \"What is that?\"\nsaid Redhead.  \"This,\" said Ralph, \"to come to Utterbol.\" \"Heaven help\nus!\" quoth Redhead, \"and wherefore?\"\n\nRalph said:  \"Belike it is neither prudent nor wise to tell thee, but I\ndo verily trust thee; so hearken!  I go to Utterbol to deliver a friend\nfrom Utterbol; and this friend is a woman--hold a minute--and this\nwoman, as I believe, hath been of late brought to Utterbol, having been\ntaken out of the hands of one of the men of the mountains that lie\nbeyond Cheaping Knowe.\"\n\nRedhead stared astonished, and kept silence awhile; then he said:  \"Now\nall the more I say, flee! flee! flee!  Doubtless the woman is there,\nwhom thou seekest; for it would take none less fair and noble than that\nnew-come thrall to draw to her one so fair and noble as thou art.  But\nwhat availeth it?  If thou go to Utterbol thou wilt destroy both her\nand thee.  For know, that we can all see that the Lord hath set his\nlove on this damsel; and what better can betide, if thou come to\nUtterbol, but that the Lord shall at once see that there is love\nbetwixt you two, and then there will be an end of the story.\"\n\n\"How so?\" quoth Ralph.  Said Redhead:  \"At Utterbol all do the will of\nthe Lord of Utterbol, and he is so lustful and cruel, and so false\nwithal, that his will shall be to torment the damsel to death, and to\ngeld and maim thee; so that none hereafter shall know how goodly and\ngallant thou hast been.\"\n\n\"Redhead,\" quoth Ralph much moved, \"though thou art in no knightly\nservice, thou mayst understand that it is good for a friend to die with\na friend.\"\n\n\"Yea, forsooth,\" said Redhead, \"If he may do no more to help than that!\nWouldst thou not help the damsel?  Now when thou comest back from the\nquest of the Well at the World's End, thou wilt be too mighty and\nglorious for the Lord of Utterbol to thrust thee aside like to an over\neager dog; and thou mayst help her then.  But now I say to thee, and\nswear to thee, that three days after thou hast met thy beloved in\nUtterbol she will be dead.  I would that thou couldst ask someone else\nnearer to the Lord than I have been.  The tale would be the same as\nmine.\"\n\nNow soothly to say it, this was even what Ralph had feared would be,\nand he could scarce doubt Redhead's word.  So he sat there pondering\nthe matter a good while, and at last he said: \"My friend, I will trust\nthee with another thing; I have a mind to flee to the wildwood, and yet\ncome to Utterbol for the damsel's deliverance.\" \"Yea,\" said Redhead,\n\"and how wilt thou work in the matter?\" Said Ralph; \"How would it be if\nI came hither in other guise than mine own, so that I should not be\nknown either by the damsel or her tyrants?\"\n\nSaid Redhead:  \"There were peril in that; yet hope also.  Yea, and in\none way thou mightest do it; to wit, if thou wert to find that Sage,\nand tell him thy tale:  if he be of good will to thee, he might then\nchange not thy gear only, but thy skin also; for he hath exceeding\ngreat lore.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ralph, \"Thou mayst look upon it as certain that on that\naforesaid night, I will do my best to shake off this company of tyrant\nand thralls, unless I hear fresh tidings, so that I must needs change\nmy purpose.  But I will ask thee to give me some token that all holds\ntogether some little time beforehand.\"  Quoth Redhead:  \"Even so shall\nit be; thou shalt see me at latest on the eve of the night of thy\ndeparture; but on the night before that if it be anywise possible.\"\n\n\"Now will I go away from thee,\" said Ralph, \"and I thank thee heartily\nfor thine help, and deem thee my friend.  And if thou think better of\nfleeing with me, thou wilt gladden me the more.\" Redhead shook his head\nbut spake not, and Ralph went his ways down the dale.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 39\n\nThe Lord of Utterbol Makes Ralph a Free Man\n\n\nHe went to and fro that day and the next, and none meddled with him;\nwith Redhead he spake not again those days, but had talk with Otter and\nDavid, who were blithe enough with him.  Agatha he saw not at all; nor\nthe Lady, and still deemed that the white-skinned woman whom he had\nseen sitting by the Lord after the tilting was the Queen.\n\nAs for the Lady she abode in her pavilion, and whiles lay in a heap on\nthe floor weeping, or dull and blind with grief; whiles she walked up\nand down mad wroth with whomsoever came in her way, even to the dealing\nout of stripes and blows to her women.\n\nBut on the eve before the day of departure Agatha came into her, and\nchid her, and bade her be merry:  \"I have seen the Lord and told him\nwhat I would, and found it no hard matter to get him to yeasay our\nplot, which were hard to carry out without his goodwill.  Withal the\nseed that I have sowed two days or more ago is bearing fruit; so that\nthou mayst look to it that whatsoever plight we may be in, we shall\nfind a deliverer.\"\n\n\"I wot not thy meaning,\" quoth the Lady, \"but I deem thou wilt now tell\nme what thou art planning, and give me some hope, lest I lay hands on\nmyself.\"\n\nThen Agatha told her without tarrying what she was about doing for her,\nthe tale of which will be seen hereafter; and when she had done, the\nLady mended her cheer, and bade bring meat and drink, and was once more\nlike a great and proud Lady.\n\nOn the morn of departure, when Ralph arose, David came to him and said:\n\"My Lord is astir already, and would see thee for thy good.\" So Ralph\nwent with David, who brought him to the Tower, and there they found the\nLord sitting in a window, and Otter stood before him, and some others\nof his highest folk.  But beside him sat Joyce, and it seemed that he\nthought it naught but good to hold her hand and play with the fingers\nthereof, though all those great men were by; and Ralph had no thought\nof her but that she was the Queen.\n\nSo Ralph made obeisance to the Lord and stood awaiting his word; and\nthe Lord said:  \"We have been thinking of thee, young man, and have\ndeemed thy lot to be somewhat of the hardest, if thou must needs be a\nthrall, since thou art both young and well-born, and so good a man of\nthine hands.  Now, wilt thou be our man at Utterbol?\"\n\nRalph delayed his answer a space and looked at Otter, who seemed to him\nto frame a Yea with his lips, as who should say, take it.  So he said:\n\"Lord, thou art good to me, yet mayst thou be better if thou wilt.\"\n\n\"Yea, man!\" said the Lord knitting his brows; \"What shall it be? say\nthy say, and be done with it.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Ralph, \"I pray thee to give me my choice, whether I shall\ngo with thee to Utterbol or forbear going?\"\n\n\"Why, lo you!\" said the Lord testily, and somewhat sourly; \"thou hast\nthe choice.  Have I not told thee that thou art free?\" Then Ralph knelt\nbefore him, and said:  \"Lord, I thank thee from a full heart, in that\nthou wilt suffer me to depart on mine errand, for it is a great one.\"\nThe scowl deepened on the Lord's face, and he turned away from Ralph,\nand said presently: \"Otter take the Knight away and let him have all\nhis armour and weapons and a right good horse; and then let him do as\nhe will, either ride with us, or depart if he will, and whither he\nwill.  And if he must needs ride into the desert, and cast himself away\nin the mountains, so be it.  But whatever he hath a mind to, let none\nhinder him, but further him rather; hearest thou? take him with thee.\"\n\nThen was Ralph overflowing with thanks, but the Lord heeded him naught,\nbut looked askance at him and sourly.  And he rose up withal, and led\nthe damsel by the hand into another chamber; and she minced in her gait\nand leaned over to the Lord and spake softly in his ear and laughed,\nand he laughed in his turn and toyed with her neck and shoulders.\n\nBut the great men turned and went their ways from the Tower, and Ralph\nwent with Otter and was full of glee, and as merry as a bird.  But\nOtter looked on him, and said gruffly: \"Yea now, thou art like a\nsong-bird but newly let out of his cage.  But I can see the string\nwhich is tied to thy leg, though thou feelest it not.\"\n\n\"Why, what now?\" quoth Ralph, making as though he were astonished.\n\"Hearken,\" said Otter:  \"there is none nigh us, so I will speak\nstraight out; for I love thee since the justing when we tried our might\ntogether.  If thou deemest that thou art verily free, ride off on the\nbackward road when we go forward; I warrant me thou shalt presently\nmeet with an adventure, and be brought in a captive for the second\ntime.\" \"How then,\" said Ralph, \"hath not the Lord good will toward me?\"\n\nSaid Otter:  \"I say not that he is now minded to do thee a mischief for\ncruelty's sake; but he is minded to get what he can out of thee.  If he\nuse thee not for the pleasuring of his wife (so long as her pleasure in\nthee lasteth) he will verily use thee for somewhat else.  And to speak\nplainly, I now deem that he will make thee my mate, to use with me, or\nagainst me as occasion may serve; so thou shalt be another captain of\nhis host.\"  He laughed withal, and said again: \"But if thou be not\nwary, thou wilt tumble off that giddy height, and find thyself a thrall\nonce more, and maybe a gelding to boot.\" Now waxed Ralph angry and\nforgat his prudence, and said: \"Yea, but how shall he use me when I am\nout of reach of his hand?\" \"Oho, young man,\" said Otter, \"whither away\nthen, to be out of his reach?\"\n\n\"Why,\" quoth Ralph still angrily, \"is thy Lord master of all the\nworld?\"  \"Nay,\" said the captain, \"but of a piece thereof.  In short,\nbetwixt Utterbol and Goldburg, and Utterbol and the mountains, and\nUtterbol and an hundred miles north, and an hundred miles south, there\nis no place where thou canst live, no place save the howling\nwilderness, and scarcely there either, where he may not lay hand on\nthee if he do but whistle.  What, man! be not downhearted! come with us\nto Utterbol, since thou needs must.  Be wise, and then the Lord shall\nhave no occasion against thee; above all, beware of crossing him in any\nmatter of a woman.  Then who knows\" (and here he sunk his voice well\nnigh to a whisper) \"but thou and I together may rule in Utterbol and\nmake better days there.\"\n\nRalph was waxen master of himself by now, and was gotten wary indeed,\nso he made as if he liked Otter's counsel well, and became exceeding\ngay; for indeed the heart within him was verily glad at the thought of\nhis escaping from thralldom; for more than ever now he was fast in his\nmind to flee at the time appointed by Redhead.\n\nSo Otter said:  \"Well, youngling, I am glad that thou takest it thus,\nfor I deem that if thou wert to seek to depart, the Lord would make it\nan occasion against thee.\"\n\n\"Such an occasion shall he not have, fellow in arms,\" quoth Ralph.\n\"But tell me, we ride presently, and I suppose are bound for Utterness\nby the shortest road?\"  \"Yea,\" said Otter, \"and anon we shall come to\nthe great forest which lieth along our road all the way to Utterness\nand beyond it; for the town is, as it were, an island in the sea of\nwoodland which covers all, right up to the feet of the Great Mountains,\nand does what it may to climb them whereso the great wall or its\nbuttresses are anywise broken down toward our country; but the end of\nit lieth along our road, as I said, and we do but skirt it.  A woeful\nwood it is, and save for the hunting of the beasts, which be there in\ngreat plenty, with wolves and bears, yea, and lions to boot, which come\ndown from the mountains, there is no gain in it.  No gain, though\nforsooth they say that some have found it gainful.\"\n\n\"How so?\" said Ralph.  Said Otter:  \"That way lieth the way to the Well\nat the World's End, if one might find it.  If at any time we were clear\nof Utterbol, I have a mind for the adventure along with thee, lad, and\nso I deem hast thou from all the questions thou hast put to me\nthereabout.\"\n\nRalph mastered himself so that his face changed not, and he said:\n\"Well, Captain, that may come to pass; but tell me, are there any\ntokens known whereby a man shall know that he is on the right path to\nthe Well?\"\n\n\"The report of folk goeth,\" said Otter, \"concerning one token, where is\nthe road and the pass through the Great Mountains, to wit, that on the\nblack rock thereby is carven the image of a Fighting Man, or monstrous\ngiant, of the days long gone by.  Of other signs I can tell thee\nnaught; and few of men are alive that can.  But there is a Sage\ndwelleth in the wood under the mountains to whom folk seek for his\ndiverse lore; and he, if he will, say men, can set forth all the way,\nand its perils, and how to escape them.  Well, knight, when the time\ncomes, thou and I will go find him together, for he at least is not\nhard to find, and if he be gracious to us, then will we on our quest.\nBut as now, see ye, they have struck our tents and the Queen's pavilion\nalso; so to horse, is the word.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth Ralph, looking curiously toward the place where the\nQueen's pavilion had stood; \"is not yonder the Queen's litter taking\nthe road?\" \"Yea, surely,\" said Otter.\n\n\"Then the litter will be empty,\" said Ralph.  \"Maybe, or maybe not,\"\nsaid Otter; \"but now I must get me gone hastily to my folk; doubtless\nwe shall meet upon the road to Utterbol.\"\n\nSo he turned and went his ways; and Ralph also ran to his horse,\nwhereby was David already in the saddle, and so mounted, and the whole\nrout moved slowly from out of Vale Turris, Ralph going ever by David.\nThe company was now a great one, for many wains were joined to them,\nladen with meal, and fleeces, and other household stuff, and withal\nthere was a great herd of neat, and of sheep, and of goats, which the\nLord's men had been gathering in the fruitful country these two days;\nbut the Lord was tarrying still in the tower.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 40\n\nThey Ride Toward Utterness From Out of Vale Turris\n\n\nSo they rode by a good highway, well beaten, past the Tower and over\nthe ridge of the valley, and came full upon the terrible sight of the\nGreat Mountains, and the sea of woodland lay before them, swelling and\nfalling, and swelling again, till it broke grey against the dark blue\nof the mountain wall.  They went as the way led, down hill, and when\nthey were at the bottom, thence along their highway parted the tillage\nand fenced pastures from the rough edges of the woodland like as a\nditch sunders field from field.  They had the wildwood ever on their\nright hand, and but a little way from where they rode the wood\nthickened for the more part into dark and close thicket, the trees\nwhereof were so tall that they hid the overshadowing mountains whenso\nthey rode the bottoms, though when the way mounted on the ridges, and\nthe trees gave back a little, they had sight of the woodland and the\nmountains.  On the other hand at whiles the thicket came close up to\nthe roadside.\n\nNow David biddeth press on past the wains and the driven beasts, which\nwere going very slowly.  So did they, and at last were well nigh at the\nhead of the Lord's company, but when Ralph would have pressed on still,\nDavid refrained him, and said that they must by no means outgo the\nQueen's people, or even mingle with them; so they rode on softly.  But\nas the afternoon was drawing toward evening they heard great noise of\nhorns behind them, and the sound of horses galloping.  Then David drew\nRalph to the side of the way, and everybody about, both before and\nbehind them, drew up in wise at the wayside, and or ever Ralph could\nask any question, came a band of men-at-arms at the gallop led by\nOtter, and after them the Lord on his black steed, and beside him on a\nwhite palfrey the woman whom Ralph had seen in the Tower, and whom he\nhad taken for the Queen, her light raiment streaming out from her, and\nher yellow hair flying loose.  They passed in a moment of time, and\nthen David and Ralph and the rest rode on after them.\n\nThen said Ralph:  \"The Queen rideth well and hardily.\" \"Yea,\" said\nDavid, screwing his face into a grin, would he or no.  Ralph beheld\nhim, and it came into his mind that this was not the Queen whom he had\nlooked on when they first came into Vale Turris, and he said: \"What\nthen! this woman is not the Queen?\"\n\nDavid spake not for a while, and then he answered: \"Sir Knight, there\nbe matters whereof we servants of my Lord say little or nothing, and\nthou wert best to do the like.\" And no more would he say thereon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 41\n\nRedhead Keeps Tryst\n\n\nThey rode not above a dozen miles that day, and pitched their tents and\npavilions in the fair meadows by the wayside looking into the thick of\nthe forest.  There this betid to tell of, that when Ralph got off his\nhorse, and the horse-lads were gathered about the men-at-arms and high\nfolk, who should take Ralph's horse but Redhead, who made a sign to him\nby lifting his eyebrows as if he were asking him somewhat; and Ralph\ntook it as a question as to whether his purpose held to flee on the\nmorrow night; so he nodded a yeasay, just so much as Redhead might note\nit; and naught else befell betwixt them.\n\nWhen it was barely dawn after that night, Ralph awoke with the sound of\ngreat stir in the camp, and shouting of men and lowing and bleating of\nbeasts; so he looked out, and saw that the wains and the flocks and\nherds were being got on to the road, so that they might make good way\nbefore the company of the camp took the road.  But he heeded it little\nand went to sleep again.\n\nWhen it was fully morning he arose, and found that the men were not\nhastening their departure, but were resting by the wood-side and\ndisporting them about the meadow; so he wandered about amongst the\nmen-at-arms and serving-men, and came across Redhead and hailed him;\nand there was no man very nigh to them; so Redhead looked about him\nwarily, and then spake swiftly and softly: \"Fail not to-night! fail\nnot!  For yesterday again was I told by one who wotteth surely, what\nabideth thee at Utterbol if thou go thither.  I say if thou fail, thou\nshalt repent but once--all thy life long to wit.\"\n\nRalph nodded his head, and said:  \"Fear not, I will not fail thee.\" And\ntherewith they turned away from each other lest they should be noted.\n\nAbout two hours before noon they got to horse again, and, being no more\nencumbered with the wains and the beasts, rode at a good pace.  As on\nthe day before the road led them along the edge of the wildwood, and\nwhiles it even went close to the very thicket.  Whiles again they\nmounted somewhat, and looked down on the thicket, leagues and leagues\nthereof, which yet seemed but a little space because of the hugeness of\nthe mountain wall which brooded over it; but oftenest the forest hid\nall but the near trees.\n\nThus they rode some twenty miles, and made stay at sunset in a place\nthat seemed rather a clearing of the wood than a meadow; for they had\ntrees on their left hand at a furlong's distance, as well as on their\nright at a stone's throw.\n\nRalph saw not Redhead as he got off his horse, and David according to\nhis wont went with him to his tent.  But after they had supped\ntogether, and David had made much of Ralph, and had drank many cups to\nhis health, he said to him: \"The night is yet young, yea, but new-born;\nyet must I depart from thee, if I may, to meet a man who will sell me a\nnoble horse good cheap; and I may well leave thee now, seeing that thou\nhast become a free man; so I bid thee goodnight.\"\n\nTherewith he departed, and was scarce gone out ere Redhead cometh in,\nand saith in his wonted rough loud voice:  \"Here, knight, here is the\nbridle thou badest me get mended; will the cobbling serve?\" Then seeing\nno one there, he fell to speaking softer and said: \"I heard the old\npimp call thee a free man e'en now: I fear me that thou art not so free\nas he would have thee think.  Anyhow, were I thou, I would be freer in\ntwo hours space.  Is it to be so?\"\n\n\"Yea, yea,\" said Ralph.  Redhead nodded:  \"Good is that,\" said he; \"I\nsay in two hours' time all will be quiet, and we are as near the\nthicket as may be; there is no moon, but the night is fair and the\nstars clear; so all that thou hast to do is to walk out of this tent,\nand turn at once to thy right hand: come out with me now quietly, and I\nwill show thee.\"\n\nThey went out together and Redhead said softly:  \"Lo thou that doddered\noak yonder; like a piece of a hay-rick it looks under the stars; if\nthou seest it, come in again at once.\"\n\nRalph turned and drew Redhead in, and said when they were in the tent\nagain: \"Yea, I saw it:  what then?\"\n\nSaid Redhead:  \"I shall be behind it abiding thee.\" \"Must I go afoot?\"\nsaid Ralph, \"or how shall I get me a horse?\" \"I have a horse for thee,\"\nsaid Redhead, \"not thine own, but a better one yet, that hath not been\nbacked to-day. Now give me a cup of wine, and let me go.\"\n\nRalph filled for him and took a cup himself, and said: \"I pledge thee,\nfriend, and wish thee better luck; and I would have thee for my fellow\nin this quest.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Redhead, \"it may not be:  I will not burden thy luck with\nmy ill-luck...and moreover I am seeking something which I may gain at\nUtterbol, and if I have it, I may do my best to say good-night to that\nevil abode.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and I wish thee well therein.\" Said Redhead,\nstammering somewhat; \"It is even that woman of the Queen's whereof I\ntold thee.  And now one last word, since I must not be over long in thy\ntent, lest some one come upon us.  But, fair sir, if thy mind misgive\nthee for this turning aside from Utterbol; though it is not to be\ndoubted that the damsel whom thou seekest hath been there, it is not\nall so sure that thou wouldst have found her there.  For of late, what\nwith my Lord and my Lady being both away, the place hath been scant of\nfolk; and not only is the said damsel wise and wary, but there be\nothers who have seen her besides my Lord, and who so hath seen her is\nlike to love her; and such is she, that whoso loveth her is like to do\nher will.  So I bid thee in all case be earnest in thy quest; and think\nthat if thou die on the road thy damsel would have died for thee; and\nif thou drink of the Well and come back whole and safe, I know not why\nthou shouldest not go straight to Utterbol and have the damsel away\nwith thee, whosoever gainsay it.  For they (if there be any such) who\nhave drunk of the Well at the World's End are well looked to in this\nland.  Now one more word yet; when I come to Utterbol, if thy damsel be\nthere still, fear not but I will have speech of her, and tell of thee,\nand what thou wert looking to, and how thou deemedst of her.\"\n\nTherewith he turned and departed hastily.\n\nBut Ralph left alone was sorely moved with hope and fear, and a longing\nthat grew in him to see the damsel.  For though he was firmly set on\ndeparture, and on seeking the sage aforesaid, yet his heart was drawn\nthis way and that: and it came into his mind how the damsel would fare\nwhen the evil Lord came home to Utterbol; and he could not choose but\nmake stories of her meeting of the tyrant, and her fear and grief and\nshame, and the despair of her heart.  So the minutes went slow to him,\ntill he should be in some new place and doing somewhat toward bringing\nabout the deliverance of her from thralldom, and the meeting of him and\nher.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THREE\n\nThe Road To The Well At World's End.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nAn Adventure in the Wood Under the Mountains\n\n\nNow was the night worn to the time appointed, for it was two hours\nafter midnight, so he stepped out of his tent clad in all his war gear,\nand went straight to the doddered oak, and found Redhead there with but\none horse, whereby Ralph knew that he held to his purpose of going his\nways to Utterbol: so he took him by the shoulders and embraced him,\nrough carle as he was, and Redhead kneeled to him one moment of time\nand then arose and went off into the night.  But Ralph got a-horseback\nwithout delay and rode his ways warily across the highway and into the\nwood, and there was none to hinder him.  Though it was dark but for the\nstarlight, there was a path, which the horse, and not Ralph, found, so\nthat he made some way even before the first glimmer of dawn, all the\nmore as the wood was not very thick after the first mile, and there\nwere clearings here and there.\n\nSo rode Ralph till the sun was at point to rise, and he was about the\nmidst of one of those clearings or wood-lawns, on the further side\nwhereof there was more thicket, as he deemed, then he had yet come to;\nso he drew rein and looked about him for a minute.  Even therewith he\ndeemed he heard a sound less harsh than the cry of the jay in the\nbeech-trees, and shriller than the moaning of the morning breeze in the\nwood.  So he falls to listening with both ears, and this time deems\nthat he hears the voice of a woman:  and therewith came into his mind\nthat old and dear adventure of the Wood Perilous; for he was dreamy\nwith the past eagerness of his deeds, and the long and lonely night.\nBut yet he doubted somewhat of the voice when it had passed his ears,\nso he shook his rein, for he thought it not good to tarry.\n\nScarce then had his horse stepped out, ere there came a woman running\nout of the thicket before him and made toward him over the lawn.  So he\ngat off his horse at once and went to meet her, leading his horse; and\nas he drew nigh he could see that she was in a sorry plight; she had\ngathered up her skirts to run the better, and her legs and feet were\nnaked: the coif was gone from her head and her black hair streamed out\nbehind her: her gown was rent about the shoulders and bosom, so that\none sleeve hung tattered, as if by the handling of some one.\n\nSo she ran up to him crying out:  \"Help, knight, help us!\" and sank\ndown therewith at his feet panting and sobbing.  He stooped down to\nher, and raised her up, and said in a kind voice: \"What is amiss, fair\ndamsel, that thou art in such a plight; and what may I for thine avail?\nDoth any pursue thee, that thou fleest thus?\"\n\nShe stood sobbing awhile, and then took hold of his two hands and said:\n\"O fair lord, come now and help my lady! for as for me, since I am with\nthee, I am safe.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"Shall I get to horse at once?\" And therewith he made\nas if he would move away from her; but she still held his hands, and\nseemed to think it good so to do, and she spake not for a while but\ngazed earnestly into his face.  She was a fair woman, dark and sleek\nand lithe...for in good sooth she was none other than Agatha, who is\nafore told of.\n\nNow Ralph is somewhat abashed by her eagerness, and lets his eyes fall\nbefore hers; and he cannot but note that despite the brambles and\nbriars of the wood that she had run through, there were no scratches on\nher bare legs, and that her arm was unbruised where the sleeve had been\nrent off.\n\nAt last she spake, but somewhat slowly, as if she were thinking of what\nshe had to say:  \"O knight, by thy knightly oath I charge thee come to\nmy lady and help and rescue her: she and I have been taken by evil men,\nand I fear that they will put her to shame, and torment her, ere they\ncarry her off; for they were about tying her to a tree when I escaped:\nfor they heeded not me who am but the maid, when they had the mistress\nin their hands.\"  \"Yea,\" said he, \"and who is thy mistress?\" Said the\ndamsel:  \"She is the Lady of the Burnt Rock; and I fear me that these\nmen are of the Riders of Utterbol; and then will it go hard with her;\nfor there is naught but hatred betwixt my lord her husband and the\ntyrant of Utterbol.\" Said Ralph:  \"And how many were they?\"  \"O but\nthree, fair sir, but three,\" she said; \"and thou so fair and strong,\nlike the war-god himself.\"\n\nRalph laughed:  \"Three to one is long odds,\" quoth he, \"but I will come\nwith thee when thou hast let go my hands so that I may mount my horse.\nBut wilt thou not ride behind me, fair damsel; so wearied and spent as\nthou wilt be by thy night.\"\n\nShe looked on him curiously, and laid a hand on his breast, and the\nhauberk rings tinkled beneath the broidered surcoat; then she said:\n\"Nay, I had best go afoot before thee, so disarrayed as I am.\"\n\nThen she let him go, but followed him still with her eyes as he gat him\ninto the saddle.  She walked on beside his horse's head; and Ralph\nmarvelled of her that for all her haste she had been in, she went\nsomewhat leisurely, picking her way daintily so as to tread the smooth,\nand keep her feet from the rough.\n\nThus they went on, into the thicket and through it, and the damsel put\nthe thorns and briars aside daintily as she stepped, and went slower\nstill till they came to a pleasant place of oak-trees with greensward\nbeneath them; and then she stopped, and turning, faced Ralph, and spoke\nwith another voice than heretofore, whereas there was naught rueful or\nwhining therein, but somewhat both of glee and of mocking as it seemed.\n\"Sir knight,\" she said, \"I have a word or two for thy ears; and this is\na pleasant place, and good for us to talk together, whereas it is\nneither too near to her, nor too far from her, so that I can easily\nfind my way back to her.  Now, lord, I pray thee light down and listen\nto me.\"  And therewith she sat down on the grass by the bole of a great\noak.\n\n\"But thy lady,\" said Ralph, \"thy lady?\"  \"O sir,\" she said; \"My lady\nshall do well enough:  she is not tied so fast, but she might loose\nherself if the need were pressing.  Light down, dear lord, light down!\"\n\nBut Ralph sat still on his horse, and knit his brows, and said: \"What\nis this, damsel? hast thou been playing a play with me?  Where is thy\nlady whom thou wouldst have me deliver?  If this be but game and play,\nlet me go my ways; for time presses, and I have a weighty errand on\nhand.\"\n\nShe rose up and came close to him, and laid a hand on his knee and\nlooked wistfully into his face as she said:  \"Nay then, I can tell thee\nall the tale as thou sittest in thy saddle; for meseems short will be\nthy farewell when I have told it.\" And she sighed withal.\n\nThen Ralph was ashamed to gainsay her, and she now become gentle and\nsweet and enticing, and sad withal; so he got off his horse and tied\nhim to a tree, and went and stood by the damsel as she lay upon the\ngrass, and said: \"I prithee tell thy tale and let me depart if there be\nnaught for me to do.\"\n\nThen she said:  \"This is the first word, that as to the Red Rock, I\nlied; and my lady is the Queen of Utterbol, and I am her thrall, and it\nis I who have drawn thee hither from the camp.\"\n\nThe blood mounted to Ralph's brow for anger; when he called to mind how\nhe had been led hither and thither on other folk's errands ever since\nhe left Upmeads.  But he said naught, and Agatha looked on him timidly\nand said: \"I say I am her thrall, and I did it to serve her and because\nshe bade me.\" Said Ralph roughly:  \"And Redhead, him whom I saved from\ntorments and death; dost thou know him? didst thou know him?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"I had from him what he had learned concerning thee\nfrom the sergeants and others, and then I put words into his mouth.\"\n\"Yea then,\" quoth Ralph, \"then he also is a traitor!\"  \"Nay, nay,\" she\nsaid, \"he is a true man and loveth thee, and whatever he hath said to\nthee he troweth himself.  Moreover, I tell thee here and now that all\nthat he told thee of the affairs of Utterbol, and thine outlook there,\nis true and overtrue.\"\n\nShe sprang to her feet therewith, and stood before him and clasped her\nhands before him and said:  \"I know that thou seekest the Well at the\nWorld's End and the deliverance of the damsel whom the Lord ravished\nfrom the wild man: now I swear it by thy mouth, that if thou go to\nUtterbol thou art undone and shalt come to the foulest pass there, and\nmoreover that so going thou shalt bring the uttermost shame and\ntorments on the damsel.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Yea, but what is her case as now? tell me.\"\n\nQuoth Agatha:  \"She is in no such evil case; for my lady hateth her not\nas yet, or but little; and, which is far more, my lord loveth her after\nhis fashion, and withal as I deem feareth her; for though she hath\nutterly gainsaid his desire, he hath scarce so much as threatened her.\nA thing unheard of.  Had it been another woman she had by this time\nknown all the bitterness that leadeth unto death at Utterbol.\" Ralph\npaled and he scowled on her, then he said: \"And how knowest thou all\nthe privity of the Lord of Utterbol?  who telleth thee of all this?\"\nShe smiled and spake daintily: \"Many folk tell me that which I would\nknow; and that is because whiles I conquer the tidings with my wits,\nand whiles buy it with my body.  Anyhow what I tell thee is the very\nsooth concerning this damsel, and this it is: that whereas she is but\nin peril, she shall be in deadly peril, yea and that instant, if thou\ngo to Utterbol, thou, who art her lover...\" \"Nay,\" said Ralph angrily,\n\"I am not her lover, I am but her well-willer.\" \"Well,\" quoth Agatha\nlooking down and knitting her brows, \"when thy good will towards her\nhas become known, then shall she be thrown at once into the pit of my\nlord's cruelty.  Yea, to speak sooth, even as it is, for thy sake (for\nher I heed naught) I would that the lord might find her gone when he\ncometh back to Utterbol.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, reddening, \"and is there any hope for her getting\nclear off?\"  \"So I deem,\" said Agatha.  She was silent awhile and then\nspake in a low voice: \"It is said that each man that seeth her loveth\nher; yea, and will befriend her, even though she consent not to his\ndesire.  Maybe she hath fled from Utterbol.\"\n\nRalph stood silent awhile with a troubled face; and then he said: \"Yet\nthou hast not told me the why and wherefore of this play of thine, and\nthe beguiling me into fleeing from the camp.  Tell it me that I may\npardon thee and pass on.\"\n\nShe said:  \"By thine eyes I swear that this is sooth, and that there is\nnaught else in it than this:  My lady set her love, when first she set\nher eyes upon thee--as forsooth all women must: as for me, I had not\nseen thee (though I told my lady that I had) till within this hour that\nwe met in the wood.\"\n\nShe sighed therewith, and with her right hand played with the rent\nraiment about her bosom.  Then she said: \"She deemed that if thou\ncamest a mere thrall to Utterbol, though she might command thy body,\nyet she would not gain thy love; but that if perchance thou mightest\nsee her in hard need, and evilly mishandled, and mightest deliver her,\nthere might at least grow up pity in thee for her, and that love might\ncome thereof, as oft hath happed aforetime; for my lady is a fair\nwoman.  Therefore I, who am my lady's servant and thrall, and who, I\nbid thee remember, had not seen thee, took upon me to make this\nadventure, like to a minstrel's tale done in the flesh.  Also I spake\nto my lord and told him thereof; and though he jeered at my lady to me,\nhe was content, because he would have her set her heart on thee\nutterly; since he feared her jealousy, and would fain be delivered of\nit, lest she should play some turn to his newly beloved damsel and do\nher a mischief.  Therefore did he set thee free (in words) meaning,\nwhen he had thee safe at Utterbol again (as he nowise doubted to have\nthee) to do as he would with thee, according as occasion might serve.\nFor at heart he hateth thee, as I could see well.  So a little before\nthou didst leave the camp, we, the Queen and I, went privily into a\nplace of the woods but a little way hence.  There I disarrayed both my\nlady and myself so far as was needful for the playing out the play\nwhich was to have seemed to thee a real adventure.  Then came I to thee\nas if by chance hap, that I might bring thee to her; and if thou hadst\ncome, we had a story for thee, whereby thou mightest not for very\nknighthood forbear to succour her and bring her whither she would,\nwhich in the long run had been Utterbol, but for the present time was\nto have been a certain strong-house appertaining to Utterbol, and nigh\nunto it.  This is all the tale, and now if thou wilt, thou mayst pardon\nme; or if thou wilt, thou mayst draw out thy sword and smite off my\nhead.  And forsooth I deem that were the better deed.\"\n\nShe knelt down before him and put her palms together, and looked up at\nhim beseechingly.  His face darkened as he beheld her thus, but it\ncleared at last, and he said: \"Damsel, thou wouldst turn out but a\nsorry maker, and thy play is naught.  For seest thou not that I should\nhave found out all the guile at Utterbol, and owed thy lady hatred\nrather than love thereafter.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"but my lady might have had enough of thy love by\nthen, and would belike have let thee alone to fall into the hands of\nthe Lord.  Lo now!  I have delivered thee from this, so that thou art\nquit both of the Lord and the lady and me:  and again I say that thou\ncouldst scarce have missed, both thou and thy damsel, of a miserable\nending at Utterbol.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, softly, and as if speaking to himself, \"yet am I\nlonely and unholpen.\"  Then he turned to Agatha and said: \"The end of\nall this is that I pardon thee, and must depart forthwith; for when ye\ntwo come back to the camp, then presently will the hunt be up.\"\n\nShe rose from her knees, and stood before him humbly and said: \"Nay, I\nshall requite thee thy pardon thus far, that I will fashion some tale\nfor my lady which will keep us in the woods two days or three; for we\nhave provided victual for our adventure.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"I may at least thank thee for that, and will trust in\nthee to do so much.\"  Quoth she:  \"Then might I ask a reward of thee:\nsince forsooth other reward awaiteth me at Utterbol.\"\n\n\"Thou shalt have it,\" said Ralph.  She said:  \"The reward is that thou\nkiss me ere we part.\"\n\n\"It must needs be according to my word,\" said Ralph, \"yet I must tell\nthee that my kiss will bear but little love with it.\"\n\nShe answered naught but laid her hands on his breast and put up her\nface to him, and he kissed her lips.  Then she said: \"Knight, thou hast\nkissed a thrall and a guileful woman, yet one that shall smart for\nthee; therefore grudge not the kiss nor repent thee of thy kindness.\"\n\n\"How shalt thou suffer?\" said he.  She looked on him steadfastly a\nmoment, and said:  \"Farewell! may all good go with thee.\" Therewith she\nturned away and walked off slowly through the wood, and somewhat he\npitied her, and sighed as he got into his saddle; but he said to\nhimself:  \"How might I help her?  Yet true it is that she may well be\nin an evil case:  I may not help everyone.\" Then he shook his rein and\nrode his ways.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nRalph Rides the Wood Under the Mountains\n\n\nA long way now rode Ralph, and naught befell him but the fashion of the\nwood.  And as he rode, the heart within him was lightened that he had\nescaped from all the confusion and the lying of those aliens, who knew\nhim not, nor his kindred, and yet would all use him each for his own\nends: and withal he was glad that he was riding all alone upon his\nquest, but free, unwounded, and well weaponed.\n\nThe wood was not very thick whereas he rode, so that he could see the\nwhereabouts of the sun, and rode east as far as he could judge it.\nSome little victual he had with him, and he found woodland fruit\nripening here and there, and eked out his bread therewith; neither did\nwater fail him, for he rode a good way up along a woodland stream that\ncleft the thicket, coming down as he deemed from the mountains, and\nthereby he made the more way:  but at last he deemed that he must needs\nleave it, as it turned overmuch to the north.  The light was failing\nwhen he came into a woodlawn amidst of which was a pool of water, and\nall that day he had had no adventure with beast or man, since he had\nsundered from Agatha.  So he lay down and slept there with his naked\nsword by his side, and awoke not till the sun was high in the heavens\nnext morning.  Then he arose at once and went on his way after he had\nwashed him, and eaten a morsel.\n\nAfter a little the thick of the wood gave out, and the land was no\nlonger flat, as it had been, but was of dales and of hills, not blinded\nby trees.  In this land he saw much deer, as hart and wild swine; and\nhe happened also on a bear, who was about a honey tree, and had taken\nmuch comb from the wild bees.  On him Ralph drew his sword and drave\nhim exceeding loth from his purchase, so that the knight dined off the\nbear's thieving.  Another time he came across a bent where on the south\nside grew vines well fruited, and the grapes a-ripening; and he ate\nwell thereof before he went on his way.\n\nBefore nightfall he came on that same stream again, and it was now\nrunning straight from the east; so he slept that night on the bank\nthereof.  On the morrow he rode up along it a great way, till again it\nseemed to be coming overmuch from the north; and then he left it, and\nmade on east as near as he could guess it by the sun.\n\nNow he passed through thickets at whiles not very great, and betwixt\nthem rode hilly land grassed mostly with long coarse grass, and with\nwhin and thorn-trees scattered about.  Thence he saw again from time to\ntime the huge wall of the mountains rising up into the air like a great\nblack cloud that would swallow up the sky, and though the sight was\nterrible, yet it gladdened him, since he knew that he was on the right\nway.  So far he rode, going on the whole up-hill, till at last there\nwas a great pine-wood before him, so that he could see no ending to it\neither north or south.\n\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and Ralph pondered whether he should\nabide the night where he was and sleep the night there, or whether he\nshould press on in hope of winning to some clear place before dark.  So\nwhereas he was in a place both rough and waterless, he deemed it better\nto go on, after he had rested his horse and let him bite the herbage a\nwhile.  Then he rode his ways, and entered the wood and made the most\nof the way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nRalph Meeteth With Another Adventure in the Wood Under the Mountain\n\n\nSoon the wood grew very thick of pine-trees, though there was no\nundergrowth, so that when the sun sank it grew dark very speedily; but\nhe still rode on in the dusk, and there were but few wild things, and\nthose mostly voiceless, in the wood, and it was without wind and very\nstill.  Now he thought he heard the sound of a horse going behind him\nor on one side, and he wondered whether the chace were up, and hastened\nwhat he might, till at last it grew black night, and he was constrained\nto abide.  So he got off his horse, and leaned his back against a tree,\nand had the beast's reins over his arm; and now he listened again\ncarefully, and was quite sure that he could hear the footsteps of some\nhard-footed beast going nowise far from him.  He laughed inwardly, and\nsaid to himself: \"If the chacer were to pass but three feet from my\nnose he should be none the wiser but if he hear me or my horse.\" And\ntherewith he cast a lap of his cloak over the horse's head, lest he\nshould whinny if he became aware of the other beast; and so there he\nstood abiding, and the noise grew greater till he could hear clearly\nthe horse-hoofs drawing nigh, till they came very nigh, and then\nstopped.\n\nThen came a man's voice that said:  \"Is there a man anigh in the wood?\"\n\nRalph held his peace till he should know more; and the voice spake\nagain in a little while:  \"If there be a man anigh let him be sure that\nI will do him no hurt; nay, I may do him good, for I have meat with\nme.\" Clear was the voice, and as sweet as the April blackbird sings.\nIt spake again:  \"Naught answereth, yet meseemeth I know surely that a\nman is anigh; and I am aweary of the waste, and long for fellowship.\"\n\nRalph hearkened, and called to mind tales of way-farers entrapped by\nwood-wives and evil things; but he thought: \"At least this is no\nsending of the Lord of Utterbol, and, St. Nicholas to aid, I have\nlittle fear of wood-wights. Withal I shall be but a dastard if I answer\nnot one man, for fear of I know not what.\"  So he spake in a loud and\ncheerful voice: \"Yea, there is a man anigh, and I desire thy\nfellowship, if we might but meet.  But how shall we see each other in\nthe blackness of the wildwood night?\"\n\nThe other laughed, and the laugh sounded merry and sweet, and the voice\nsaid:  \"Hast thou no flint and fire-steel?\" \"No,\" said Ralph.  \"But I\nhave,\" said the voice, \"and I am fain to see thee, for thy voice\nsoundeth pleasant to me.  Abide till I grope about for a stick or two.\"\n\nRalph laughed in turn, as he heard the new-comer moving about; then he\nheard the click of the steel on the flint, and saw the sparks showering\ndown, so that a little piece of the wood grew green again to his eyes.\nThen a little clear flame sprang up, and therewith he saw the\ntree-stems clearly, and some twenty yards from him a horse, and a man\nstooping down over the fire, who sprang up now and cried out: \"It is a\nknight-at-arms! Come hither, fellow of the waste; it is five days since\nI have spoken to a child of Adam; so come nigh and speak to me, and as\na reward of thy speech thou shalt have both meat and firelight.\"\n\n\"That will be well paid,\" said Ralph laughing, and he stepped forward\nleading his horse, for now the wood was light all about, as the fire\nwaxed and burned clear; so that Ralph could see that the new-comer was\nclad in quaintly-fashioned armour after the fashion of that land, with\na bright steel sallet on the head, and a long green surcoat over the\nbody armour.  Slender of make was the new-comer, not big nor tall of\nstature.\n\nRalph went up to him hastily, and merrily put his hand on his shoulder,\nand kissed him, saying:  \"The kiss of peace in the wilderness to thee!\"\nAnd he found him smooth-faced and sweet-breathed.\n\nBut the new comer took his hand and led him to where the firelight was\nbrightest and looked on him silently a while; and Ralph gave back the\nlook.  The strange-wrought sallet hid but little of the new comer's\nface, and as Ralph looked thereon a sudden joy came into his heart, and\nhe cried out: \"O, but I have kissed thy face before!  O, my friend, my\nfriend!\"\n\nThen spake the new-comer and said:  \"Yea, I am a woman, and I was thy\nfriend for a little while at Bourton Abbas, and at the want-ways of the\nWood Perilous.\"\n\nThen Ralph cast his arms about her and kissed her again; but she\nwithdrew her from him, and said:  \"Help me, my friend, that we may\ngather sticks to feed our fire, lest it die and the dark come again so\nthat we see not each other's faces, and think that we have but met in a\ndream.\"\n\nThen she busied herself with gathering the kindling; but presently she\nlooked up at him, and said:  \"Let us make the wood shine wide about,\nfor this is a feastful night.\"\n\nSo they gathered a heap of wood and made the fire great; and then Ralph\ndid off his helm and hauberk and the damsel did the like, so that he\ncould see the shapeliness of her uncovered head.  Then they sat down\nbefore the fire, and the damsel drew meat and drink from her\nsaddle-bags, and gave thereof to Ralph, who took it of her and her hand\nwithal, and smiled on her and said:  \"Shall we be friends together as\nwe were at Bourton Abbas and the want-ways of the Wood Perilous?\" She\nshook her head and said:  \"If it might be! but it may not be.  Not many\ndays have worn since then; but they have brought about changed days.\"\nHe looked on her wistfully and said: \"But thou wert dear to me then.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"and thou to me; but other things have befallen, and\nthere is change betwixt.\"\n\n\"Nay, what change?\" said Ralph.\n\nEven by the firelight he saw that she reddened as she answered: \"I was\na free woman then; now am I but a runaway thrall.\" Then Ralph laughed\nmerrily, and said, \"Then are we brought the nigher together, for I also\nam a runaway thrall.\"\n\nShe smiled and looked down:  then she said:  \"Wilt thou tell me how\nthat befell?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"but I will ask thee first a question or two.\" She\nnodded a yeasay, and looked on him soberly, as a child waiting to say\nits task.\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"When we parted at the want-ways of the Wood Perilous thou\nsaidst that thou wert minded for the Well at the World's End, and to\ntry it for life or death.  But thou hadst not then the necklace, which\nnow I see thee bear, and which, seest thou! is like to that about my\nneck.  Wilt thou tell me whence thou hadst it?\"\n\nShe said:  \"Yea; it was given unto me by a lady, mighty as I deem, and\ncertainly most lovely, who delivered me from an evil plight, and a\nperil past words, but whereof I will tell thee afterwards.  And she it\nwas who told me of the way to the Well at the World's End, and many\nmatters concerning them that seek it, whereof thou shalt wot soon.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"As to how thou wert made a thrall thou needest not to\ntell me; for I have learned that of those that had to do with taking\nthee to Utterbol.  But tell me; here are met we two in the pathless\nwilds, as if it were on the deep sea, and we two seeking the same\nthing.  Didst thou deem that we should meet, or that I should seek\nthee?\"\n\nNow was the fire burning somewhat low, but he saw that she looked on\nhim steadily; yet withal her sweet voice trembled a little as she\nanswered: \"Kind friend, I had a hope that thou wert seeking me and\nwouldst find me: for indeed that fairest of women who gave me the beads\nspake to me of thee, and said that thou also wouldst turn thee to the\nquest of the Well at the World's End; and already had I deemed thine\neyes lucky as well as lovely.  But tell me, my friend, what has\nbefallen that lady that she is not with thee?  For in such wise she\nspake of thee, that I deemed that naught would sunder you save death.\"\n\n\"It is death that hath sundered us,\" said Ralph.\n\nThen she hung her head, and sat silent a while, neither did he speak\ntill she had risen up and cast more wood upon the fire; and she stood\nbefore it with her back towards him.  Then he spake to her in a\ncheerful voice and said:  \"Belike we shall be long together:  tell me\nthy name; is it not Dorothy?\" She turned about to him with a smiling\nface, and said: \"Nay lord, nay:  did I not tell thee my name before?\nThey that held me at the font bid the priest call me Ursula, after the\nFriend of Maidens.  But what is thy name?\"\n\n\"I am Ralph of Upmeads,\" quoth he; and sat a while silent, pondering\nhis dream and how it had betrayed him as to her name, when it had told\nhim much that he yet deemed true.\n\nShe came and sat down by him again, and said to him:  \"Thy questions I\nhave answered; but thou hast not yet told me the tale of thy\ncaptivity.\" Her voice sounded exceeding sweet to him, and he looked on\nher face and spake as kindly as he knew how, and said:  \"A short tale\nit is to-night at least: I came from Whitwall with a Company of\nChapmen, and it was thee I was seeking and the Well at the World's End.\nAll went well with me, till I came to Goldburg, and there I was\nbetrayed by a felon, who had promised to lead me safe to Utterness, and\ntell me concerning the way unto the Well.  But he sold me to the Lord\nof Utterbol, who would lead me to his house; which irked me not, at\nfirst, because I looked to find thee there.  Thereafter, if for shame I\nmay tell the tale, his lady and wife cast her love upon me, and I was\nentangled in the nets of guile: yet since I was told, and believed that\nit would be ill both for thee and for me if I met thee at Utterbol, I\ntook occasion to flee away, I will tell thee how another while.\"\n\nShe had turned pale as she heard him, and now she said:  \"It is indeed\nGod's mercy that thou camest not to Utterbol nor foundest me there, for\nthen had both we been undone amidst the lusts of those two; or that\nthou camest not there to find me fled, else hadst thou been undone.  My\nheart is sick to think of it, even as I sit by thy side.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Thy last word maketh me afraid and ashamed to ask thee a\nthing.  But tell me first, is that Lord of Utterbol as evil as men's\nfear would make him? for no man is feared so much unless he is deemed\nevil.\"\n\nShe was silent a while, and then she said:  \"He is so evil that it\nmight be deemed that he has been brought up out of hell.\"\n\nThen Ralph looked sore troubled, and he said:  \"Dear friend, this is\nthe thing hard for me to say.  In what wise did they use thee at\nUtterbol?  Did they deal with thee shamefully?\"  She answered him\nquietly: \"Nay,\" she said, \"fear not! no shame befell me, save that I\nwas a thrall and not free to depart.  Forsooth,\" she said, smiling, \"I\nfled away timely before the tormentors should be ready.  Forsooth it is\nan evil house and a mere piece of hell.  But now we are out of it and\nfree in the wildwood, so let us forget it; for indeed it is a grief to\nremember it.  And now once more let us mend the fire, for thy face is\ngrowing dim to me, and that misliketh me.  Afterwards before we lie\ndown to sleep we will talk a little of the way, whitherward we shall\nturn our faces to-morrow.\"\n\nSo they cast on more wood, and pineapples, and sweet it was to Ralph to\nsee her face come clear again from out the mirk of the wood.  Then they\nsat down again together and she said:  \"We two are seeking the Well at\nthe World's End; now which of us knows more of the way? who is to lead,\nand who to follow?\"  Said Ralph: \"If thou know no more than I, it is\nlittle that thou knowest.  Sooth it is that for many days past I have\nsought thee that thou mightest lead me.\"\n\nShe laughed sweetly, and said:  \"Yea, knight, and was it for that cause\nthat thou soughtest me, and not for my deliverance?\" He said soberly:\n\"Yet in very deed I set myself to deliver thee.\" \"Yea,\" she said, \"then\nsince I am delivered, I must needs deem of it as if it were through thy\ndeed.  And as I suppose thou lookest for a reward therefor, so thy\nreward shall be, that I will lead thee to the Well at the World's End.\nIs it enough?\" \"Nay,\" said Ralph.  They held their peace a minute, then\nshe said: \"Maybe when we have drunk of that Water and are coming back,\nit will be for thee to lead.  For true it is that I shall scarce know\nwhither to wend; since amidst of my dreaming of the Well, and\nof...other matters, my home that was is gone like a dream.\"\n\nHe looked at her, but scarce as if he were heeding all her words.  Then\nhe spoke:  \"Yea, thou shalt lead me.  I have been led by one or another\never since I have left Upmeads.\" Now she looked on him somewhat\nruefully, and said: \"Thou wert not hearkening e'en now; so I say it\nagain, that the time shall come when thou shalt lead me.\"\n\nIn Ralph's mind had sprung up again that journey from the Water of the\nOak-tree; so he strove with himself to put the thought from him, and\nsighed and said:  \"Dost thou verily know much of the way?\" She nodded\nyeasay.  \"Knowest thou of the Rock of the Fighting Man?\" \"Yea,\" she\nsaid.  \"And of the Sage that dwelleth in this same wood?\" \"Most\nsurely,\" she said, \"and to-morrow evening or the morrow after we shall\nfind him; for I have been taught the way to his dwelling; and I wot\nthat he is now called the Sage of Swevenham.  Yet I must tell thee that\nthere is some peril in seeking to him; whereas his dwelling is known of\nthe Utterbol riders, who may follow us thither.  And yet again I deem\nthat he will find some remedy thereto.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Whence didst thou learn all this, my friend?\" And his\nface grew troubled again; but she said simply: \"She taught it to me who\nspake to me in the wood by Hampton under Scaur.\"\n\nShe made as if she noted not the trouble in his face, but said: \"Put\nthy trust in this, that here and with me thou art even now nigher to\nthe Well at the World's End than any other creature on the earth.  Yea,\neven if the Sage of Swevenham be dead or gone hence, yet have I tokens\nto find the Rock of the Fighting Man, and the way through the\nmountains, though I say not but that he may make it all clearer.  But\nnow I see thee drooping with the grief of days bygone; and I deem also\nthat thou art weary with the toil of the way.  So I rede thee lie down\nhere in the wilderness and sleep, and forget grief till to-morrow is a\nnew day.\"\n\n\"Would it were come,\" said he, \"that I might see thy face the clearer;\nyet I am indeed weary.\"\n\nSo he went and fetched his saddle and lay down with his head thereon;\nand was presently asleep.  But she, who had again cast wood on the\nfire, sat by his head watching him with a drawn sword beside her, till\nthe dawn of the woodland began to glimmer through the trees: then she\nalso laid herself down and slept.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nThey Ride the Wood Under the Mountains\n\n\nWhen Ralph woke on the morrow it was broad day as far as the trees\nwould have it so.  He rose at once, and looked about for his fellow,\nbut saw her not, and for some moments of time he thought he had but\ndreamed of her; but he saw that the fire had been quickened from its\nembers, and close by lay the hauberk and strange-fashioned helm, and\nthe sword of the damsel, and presently he saw her coming through the\ntrees barefoot, with the green-sleeved silken surcoat hanging below the\nknees and her hair floating loose about her.  She stepped lightly up to\nRalph with a cheerful smiling countenance and a ruddy colour in her\ncheeks, but her eyes moist as if she could scarce keep back the tears\nfor joy of the morning's meeting.  He thought her fairer than erst, and\nmade as if he would put his arms about her, but she held a little aloof\nfrom him, blushing yet more.  Then she said in her sweet clear voice:\n\"Hail fellow-farer! now begins the day's work.  I have been down\nyonder, and have found a bright woodland pool, to wash the night off\nme, and if thou wilt do in likewise and come back to me, I will dight\nour breakfast meantime, and will we speedily to the road.\"  He did as\nshe bade him, thinking of her all the while till he came back to her\nfresh and gay.  Then he looked to their horses and gave them fodder\ngathered from the pool-side, and so turned to Ursula and found her with\nthe meat ready dight; so they ate and were glad.\n\nWhen they had broken their fast Ralph went to saddle the horses, and\ncoming back found Ursula binding up her long hair, and she smiled on\nhim and said: \"Now we are for the road I must be an armed knight again:\nforsooth I unbound my hair e'en now and let my surcoat hang loose about\nme in token that thou wottest my secret.  Soothly, my friend, it irks\nme that now we have met after a long while, I must needs be clad thus\ngraceless.  But need drave me to it, and withal the occasion that was\ngiven to me to steal this gay armour from a lad at Utterbol, the nephew\nof the lord; who like his eme was half my lover, half my tyrant.  Of\nall which I will tell thee hereafter, and what wise I must needs steer\nbetwixt stripes and kisses these last days.  But now let us arm and to\nhorse.  Yet first lo you, here are some tools that in thine hands shall\nkeep us from sheer famine: as for me I am no archer; and forsooth no\nman-at-arms save in seeming.\"\n\nTherewith she showed him a short Turk bow and a quiver of arrows, which\nhe took well pleased.  So then they armed each the other, and as she\nhandled Ralph's wargear she said:  \"How well-wrought and trusty is this\nhauberk of thine, my friend; my coat is but a toy to it, with its gold\nand silver rings and its gemmed collar: and thy plates be thick and\nwide and well-wrought, whereas mine are little more than adornments to\nmy arms and legs.\"\n\nHe looked on her lovingly and loved her shapely hands amidst the dark\ngrey mail, and said:  \"That is well, dear friend, for since my breast\nis a shield for thee it behoves it to be well covered.\" She looked at\nhim, and her lips trembled, and she put out her hand as if to touch his\ncheek, but drew it back again and said: \"Come now, let us to horse,\ndear fellow in arms.\"\n\nSo they mounted and went their ways through a close pine-wood, where\nthe ground was covered with the pine-tree needles, and all was still\nand windless.  So as they rode said Ursula: \"I seek tokens of the way\nto the Sage of Swevenham.  Hast thou seen a water yesterday?\"  \"Yea,\"\nsaid Ralph, \"I rode far along it, but left it because I deemed that it\nturned north overmuch.\"  \"Thou wert right,\" she said, \"besides that thy\nturning from it hath brought us together; for it would have brought\nthee to Utterbol at last.  But now have we to hit upon another that\nrunneth straight down from the hills: not the Great Mountains, but the\nhigh ground whereon is the Sage's dwelling.  I know not whether the\nride be long or short; but the stream is to lead us.\"\n\nOn they rode through the wood, wherein was little change for hours; and\nas they rested Ursula gave forth a deep breath, as one who has cast off\na load of care.  And Ralph said:  \"Why sighest thou, fellow-farer?\"\n\"O,\" she said, \"it is for pleasure, and a thought that I had: for a\nwhile ago I was a thrall, living amongst fears that sickened the heart;\nand then a little while I was a lonely wanderer, and now...Therefore I\nwas thinking that if ever I come back to mine own land and my home, the\nscent of a pine-wood shall make me happy.\"\n\nRalph looked on her eagerly, but said naught for a while; but at last\nhe spoke:  \"Tell me, friend,\" said he, \"if we be met by strong-thieves\non the way, what shall we do then?\"\n\n\"It is not like to befall,\" she said, \"for men fear the wood, therefore\nis there little prey for thieves therein:  but if we chance on them,\nthe token of Utterbol on mine armour shall make them meek enough.\"\nThen she fell silent a while, and spoke again: \"True it is that we may\nbe followed by the Utterbol riders; for though they also fear the wood,\nthey fear it not so much as they fear their Lord.  Howbeit, we be well\nahead, and it is little like that we shall be overtaken before we have\nmet the Sage; and then belike he shall provide.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"but what if the chase come up with us: shall we\nsuffer us to be taken alive?\"  She looked on him solemnly, laid her\nhand on the beads about her neck, and answered: \"By this token we must\nlive as long as we may, whatsoever may befall; for at the worst may\nsome road of escape be opened to us.  Yet O, how far easier it were to\ndie than to be led back to Utterbol!\"\n\nA while they rode in silence, both of them:  but at last spake Ralph,\nbut slowly and in a dull and stern voice:  \"Maybe it were good that\nthou told me somewhat of the horrors and evil days of Utterbol?\"\n\"Maybe,\" she said, \"but I will not tell thee of them.  Forsooth there\nare some things which a man may not easily tell to a man, be he never\nso much his friend as thou art to me.  But bethink thee\" (and she\nsmiled somewhat) \"that this gear belieth me, and that I am but a woman;\nand some things there be which a woman may not tell to a man, nay, not\neven when he hath held her long in his arms.\" And therewith she flushed\nexceedingly.  But he said in a kind voice: \"I am sorry that I asked\nthee, and will ask thee no more thereof.\" She smiled on him friendly,\nand they spake of other matters as they rode on.\n\nBut after a while Ralph said:  \"If it were no misease to thee to tell\nme how thou didst fall into the hands of the men of Utterbol, I were\nfain to hear the tale.\"\n\nShe laughed outright, and said:  \"Why wilt thou be forever harping on\nthe time of my captivity, friend?  And thou who knowest the story\nsomewhat already?  Howbeit, I may tell thee thereof without\nheart-burning, though it be a felon tale.\"\n\nHe said, somewhat shame-facedly: \"Take it not ill that I am fain to\nhear of thee and thy life-days, since we are become fellow-farers.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"this befell outside Utterbol, so I will tell thee.\n\n\"After I had stood in the thrall-market at Cheaping Knowe, and not been\nsold, the wild man led me away toward the mountains that are above\nGoldburg; and as we drew near to them on a day, he said to me that he\nwas glad to the heart-root that none had cheapened me at the said\nmarket; and when I asked him wherefore, he fell a weeping as he rode\nbeside me, and said: 'Yet would God that I had never taken thee.'  I\nasked what ailed him, though indeed I deemed that I knew.  He said:\n'This aileth me, that though thou art not of the blood wherein I am\nbound to wed, I love thee sorely, and would have thee to wife; and now\nI deem that thou wilt not love me again.'  I said that he guessed\naright, but that if he would do friendly with me, I would be no less\nthan a friend to him.  'That availeth little,' quoth he; 'I would have\nthee be mine of thine own will.' I said that might not be, that I could\nlove but one man alone.  'Is he alive?' said he.  'Goodsooth, I hope\nso,' said I, 'but if he be dead, then is desire of men dead within me.'\n\n\"So we spake, and he was downcast and heavy of mood; but thenceforward\nwas he no worse to me than a brother.  And he proffered it to lead me\nback, if I would, and put me safely on the way to Whitwall; but, as\nthou wottest, I had need to go forward, and no need to go back.\n\n\"Thus we entered into the mountains of Goldburg; but one morning, when\nhe arose, he was heavier of mood than his wont, and was restless\nwithal, and could be steadfast neither in staying nor going, nor aught\nelse.  So I asked what ailed him, and he said: 'My end draweth nigh; I\nhave seen my fetch, and am fey.  My grave abideth me in these\nmountains.'  'Thou hast been dreaming ugly dreams,' said I, 'such\nthings are of no import.' And I spoke lightly, and strove to comfort\nhim.  He changed not his mood for all that; but said:  'This is ill for\nthee also; for thou wilt be worser without me than with me in these\nlands.' Even so I deemed, and withal I was sorry for him, for though he\nwere uncouth and ungainly, he was no ill man.  So against my will I\ntumbled into the samelike mood as his, and we both fared along\ndrearily.  But about sunset, as we came round a corner of the cliffs of\nthose mountains, or ever we were ware we happed upon a half-score of\nweaponed men, who were dighting a camp under a big rock thereby: but\nfour there were with them who were still a-horseback; so that when Bull\nNosy (for that was his name) strove to flee away with me, it was of no\navail; for the said horsemen took us, and brought us before an\nevil-looking man, who, to speak shortly, was he whom thou hast seen, to\nwit, the Lord of Utterbol: he took no heed of Bull Nosy, but looked on\nme closely, and handled me as a man doth with a horse at a cheaping, so\nthat I went nigh to smiting him, whereas I had a knife in my bosom, but\nthe chaplet refrained me.  To make a short tale of it, he bade Bull\nsell me to him, which Bull utterly naysaid, standing stiff and stark\nbefore the Lord, and scowling on him.  But the Lord laughed in his face\nand said:  'So be it, for I will take her without a price, and thank\nthee for sparing my gold.' Then said Bull:  'If thou take her as a\nthrall, thou wert best take me also; else shall I follow thee as a free\nman and slay thee when I may.  Many are the days of the year, and on\nsome one of them will betide the occasion for the knife.'\n\n\"Thereat the Lord waxed very pale, and spake not, but looked at that\nman of his who stood by Bull with a great sword in his fist, and lifted\nup his hand twice, and let it fall twice, whereat that man stepped back\none pace, and swung his sword, and smote Bull, and clave his skull.\n\n\"Then the colour came into the Lord's face again, and he said: 'Now,\nvassals, let us dine and be merry, for at least we have found something\nin the mountains.'  So they fell to and ate and drank, and victual was\ngiven to me also, but I had no will to eat, for my soul was sick and my\nheart was heavy, foreboding the uttermost evil.  Withal I was sorry for\nBull Nosy, for he was no ill man and had become my friend.\n\n\"So they abode there that night, leaving Bull lying like a dog unburied\nin the wilderness; and on the morrow they took the road to Utterbol,\nand went swiftly, having no baggage, and staying but for victual, and\nfor rest every night.  The Lord had me brought to him on that first\nevening of our journey, and he saw me privily and spake to me, bidding\nme do shameful things, and I would not; wherefore he threatened me\ngrievously; and, I being alone with him, bade him beware lest I should\nslay him or myself.  Thereat he turned pale, as he had done before Bull\nNosy, yet sent for none to slay me, but only bade me back to my\nkeepers.  And so I came to Utterbol unscathed.\"\n\n\"And at Utterbol,\" said Ralph, \"what befell thee there?\" Ursula smiled\non him, and held up her finger; yet she answered: \"Utterbol is a very\ngreat house in a fair land, and there are sundry roofs and many fair\nchambers.  There was I brought to a goodly chamber amidst a garden; and\nwomen servants were given me who led me to the bath and clad me in\ndainty raiment, and gave me to eat and to drink, and all that I needed.\nThat is all my tale for this time.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nThey Come on the Sage of Swevenham\n\n\nNight was at hand before they came to the stream that they sought.\nThey found it cleaving the pine-wood, which held on till the very bank\nof it, and was thick again on the further side in a few yards' space.\nThe stream was high-banked and ran deep and strong.  Said Ursula as\nthey came up to it: \"We may not cross it, but it matters not; and it is\nto-morrow that we must ride up along it.\"\n\nSo they abode there, and made a fire by the waterside, and watched\nthere, turn and turn about, till it was broad day.  Naught befell to\ntell of, save that twice in the night Ralph deemed that he heard a lion\nroar.\n\nThey got to horse speedily when they were both awake, and rode up the\nstream, and began to go up hill, and by noon were come into a rough and\nshaggy upland, whence from time to time they could see the huge wall of\nthe mountains, which yet seemed to Ralph scarce nigher, if at all, than\nwhen he had beheld it ere he had come to Vale Turris.  The way was\nrough day-long, and now and again they found it hard to keep the stream\nin sight, as especially when it cleft a hill, and ran between sheer\ncliffs with no low shore on either side.\n\nThey made way but slowly, so that at last Ralph lost patience somewhat,\nand said that he had but little hope of falling in with the Sage that\nday or any day.  But Ursula was of good cheer, and mocked him merrily\nbut sweetly, till his heart was lightened again.  Withal she bade him\nseek some venison, since they were drawing out the time, and she knew\nnot how long it would be ere they came to the Sage's dwelling.\nTherefore he betook him to the Turk bow, and shot a leash of\nheath-fowl, and they supped on the meat merrily in the wilderness.\n\nBut if they were merry, they were soon weary; for they journeyed on\nafter sunset that night, since the moon was up, and there was no thick\nwood to turn dusk into dark for them.  Their resting-place was a smooth\npiece of greensward betwixt the water and a half circle of steep bent\nthat well nigh locked it about.\n\nThere then they abode, and in the stillness of the night heard a\nthundering sound coming down the wind to them, which they deemed was\nthe roaring of distant waters; and when they went to the lip of the\nriver they saw flocks of foam floating by, wherefore they thought\nthemselves to be near some great mountain-neck whereover the water was\nfalling from some high place.  But with no to-do they lay down upon the\ngreensward this second night of their fellowship, and waked later than\non the day before; for so weary had they been, that they had kept but\nill watch in the dark night, and none at all after dawn began to\nglimmer.\n\nNow Ralph sat up and saw Ursula still sleeping; then he rose to his\nfeet and looked about him, and saw their two horses cropping the grass\nunder the bent, and beside them a man, tall and white bearded, leaning\non his staff.  Ralph caught up his sword and went toward the man, and\nthe sun gleamed from the blade just as the hoary-one turned to him; he\nlifted up his staff as if in greeting to Ralph, and came toward him,\nand even therewith Ursula awoke and arose, and saw the greybeard at\nonce; and she cried out: \"Take heed to thy sword, fellow-farer, for,\npraised be the saints, this is the Sage of Swevenham!\"\n\nSo they stood there together till the Sage came up to them and kissed\nthem both, and said:  \"I am glad that ye are come at last; for I looked\nfor you no later than this.  So now mount your horses and come with me\nstraightway; because life is short to them who have not yet drunk of\nthe Well at the World's End.  Moreover if ye chance to come on the\nriders of Utterbol, it shall go hard with you unless I be at hand.\"\n\nRalph saw of him that though he was an old hoar man to look on, yet he\nwas strong and sturdy, tall, and of goodly presence, with ruddy cheeks,\nand red lips and bright eyes, and that the skin of his face and hands\nwas nowise wrinkled:  but about his neck was a pair of beads like unto\nhis own gossip's gift.\n\nSo now they mounted at once, and with no more words he led them about\nthe bent, and they came in a little while into the wood again, but this\ntime it was of beech, with here and there an open place sprinkled about\nwith hollies and thorns; and they rode down the wide slope of a long\nhill, and up again on the other side.\n\nThus they went for an hour, and the elder spake not again, though it\nmight have been deemed by his eyes that he was eager and fain.  They\nalso held their peace; for the hope and fear of their hearts kept them\nfrom words.\n\nThey came to the hill-top, and found a plain land, though the close\nwood still held on a while; but soon they rode into a clearing of some\ntwelve acres, where were fenced crofts with goats therein, and three\ngarths of tillage, wherein the wheat-shocks were yet standing, and\nthere were coleworts and other pot-herbs also.  But at the further end,\nwhereas the wood closed in again, was a little house builded of timber,\nstrong and goodly, and thatched with wheat-straw; and beside it was a\nbubbling spring which ran in a brook athwart the said clearing; over\nthe house-door was a carven rood, and a bow and short spear were leaned\nagainst the wall of the porch.\n\nRalph looked at all closely, and wondered whether this were perchance\nthe cot wherein the Lady of Abundance had dwelt with the evil witch.\nBut the elder looked on him, and said:  \"I know thy thought, and it is\nnot so; that house is far away hence; yet shalt thou come thereto.\nNow, children, welcome to the house of him who hath found what ye seek,\nbut hath put aside the gifts which ye shall gain; and who belike shall\nremember what ye shall forget.\"\n\nTherewith he brought them into the house, and into a chamber, the\nplenishing whereof was both scanty and rude.  There he bade them sit,\nand brought them victual, to wit, cheese and goats' milk and bread, and\nthey fell to speech concerning the woodland ways, and the seasons, and\nother unweighty matters.  But as for the old man he spoke but few\nwords, and as one unused to speech, albeit he was courteous and\ndebonair.  But when they had eaten and drunk he spake to them and said:\n\n\"Ye have sought to me because ye would find the Well at the World's\nEnd, and would have lore of me concerning the road thereto; but before\nI tell you what ye would, let me know what ye know thereof already.\"\n\nQuoth Ralph:  \"For me, little enough I know, save that I must come to\nthe Rock of the Fighting Man, and that thou knowest the way thither.\"\n\n\"And thou, damsel,\" quoth the long-hoary, \"what knowest thou?  Must I\ntell thee of the way through the mountains and the Wall of the World,\nand the Winter Valley, and the Folk Innocent, and the Cot on the Way,\nand the Forest of Strange Things and the Dry Tree?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she said, \"of all this I wot somewhat, but it may be not enough.\"\n\nSaid the Sage:  \"Even so it was with me, when a many years ago I dwelt\nnigh to Swevenham, and folk sought to me for lore, and I told them what\nI knew; but maybe it was not enough, for they never came back; but died\nbelike or ever they had seen the Well.  And then I myself, when I was\ngotten very old, fared thither a-seeking it, and I found it; for I was\none of those who bore the chaplet of the seekers.  And now I know all,\nand can teach all.  But tell me, damsel, whence hadst thou this lore?\"\n\nSaid Ursula:  \"I had it of a very fair woman who, as it seemeth, was\nLady and Queen of the Champions of Hampton under the Scaur, not far\nfrom mine own land.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth the Sage, \"and what hath befallen her? ...  Nay, nay,\" said\nhe, \"I need not ask; for I can see by your faces that she is dead.\nTherefore hath she been slain, or otherwise she had not been dead.  So\nI ask you if ye were her friends?\"\n\nQuoth Ursula; \"Surely she was my friend, since she befriended me; and\nthis man I deem was altogether her friend.\"\n\nRalph hung his head, and the Sage gazed on him, but said naught.  Then\nhe took a hand of each of them in his hands, and held them a while\nsilently, and Ralph was still downcast and sad, but Ursula looked on\nhim fondly.\n\nThen spake the Sage:  \"So it is, Knight, that now I seem to understand\nwhat manner of man thou art, and I know what is between you two;\nwhereof I will say naught, but will let the tree grow according to its\nseed.  Moreover, I wot now that my friend of past years would have me\nmake you both wise in the lore of the Well at the World's End; and when\nI have done this, I can do no more, but let your good hap prevail if so\nit may.  Abide a little, therefore.\"\n\nThen he went unto an ark, and took thence a book wrapped in a piece of\nprecious web of silk and gold, and bound in cuir-bouilly wrought in\nstrange devices.  Then said he: \"This book was mine heritage at\nSwevenham or ever I became wise, and it came from my father's\ngrandsire: and my father bade me look on it as the dearest of\npossessions; but I heeded it naught till my youth had waned, and my\nmanhood was full of weariness and grief.  Then I turned to it, and read\nin it, and became wise, and the folk sought to me, and afterwards that\nbefell which was foredoomed.  Now herein amongst other matters is\nwritten of that which ye desire to know, and I will read the same to\nyou and expound it.  Yet were it not well to read in this book under a\nroof, nay, though it be as humble and innocent as this.  Moreover, it\nis not meet that ye should hearken to this wisdom of old times clad as\nye are; thou, knight, in the raiment of the manslayer, with the rod of\nwrath hanging at thy side; and thou, maiden, attired in the garments of\nthe tyrant, which were won of him by lying and guile.\"\n\nThen he went to another ark, and took from it two bundles, which he\ngave, the one to Ralph, the other to Ursula, and said: \"Thou, maiden,\ngo thou into the inner chamber here and doff thy worldly raiment, and\ndon that which thou wilt find wrapped in this cloth; and thou, knight,\ntake this other and get thee into the thicket which is behind the\nhouse, and there do the like, and abide there till we come to thee.\"\n\nSo Ralph took the bundle, and came out into the thicket and unarmed\nhim, and did on the raiment which he found in the cloth, which was but\na long gown of white linen, much like to an alb, broidered about the\nwrists and the hems and collar with apparels of gold and silk, girt\nwith a red silk girdle.  There he abode a little, wondering at all\nthese things and all that had befallen him since he had left Upmeads.\n\nAnon the two others came to him, and Ursula was clad in the same-like\nraiment and the elder had the book in his hand.  He smiled on Ralph and\nnodded friendly to him.  As to Ursula, she flushed as red as a rose\nwhen she set eyes on him, for she said to herself that he was as one of\nthe angels which she had seen painted in the choir of St. Mary's at\nHigham.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nThose Two Are Learned Lore by the Sage of Swevenham\n\n\nNow the Sage led them through the wood till they came to a grassy lawn\namidst of which was a table of stone, which it seemed to Ralph must be\nlike to that whereon the witch-wife had offered up the goat to her\ndevils as the Lady of Abundance had told him; and he changed\ncountenance as the thought came into his mind.  But the Sage looked on\nhim and shook his head and spake softly: \"In these wastes and wilds are\nmany such-like places, where of old time the ancient folks did worship\nto the Gods of the Earth as they imagined them:  and whereas the lore\nin this book cometh of such folk, this is no ill place for the reading\nthereof.  But if ye fear the book and its writers, who are dead long\nago, there is yet time to go back and seek the Well without my helping;\nand I say not but that ye may find it even thus.  But if ye fear not,\nthen sit ye down on the grass, and I will lay the book on this most\nancient table, and read in it, and do ye hearken heedfully.\"\n\nSo they sat down side by side, and Ralph would have taken Ursula's hand\nto caress it, but she drew it away from him; howbeit she found it hard\nto keep her eyes from off him.  The Elder looked on them soberly, but\nnowise in anger, and presently began reading in the book.  What he read\nshall be seen hereafter in the process of this tale; for the more part\nthereof had but to do with the way to the Well at the World's End, all\nthings concerning which were told out fully, both great and small.\nLong was this a-reading, and when the Sage had done, he bade now one,\nnow the other answer him questions as to what he had read; and if they\nanswered amiss he read that part again, and yet again, as children are\ntaught in the school.  Until at last when he asked any question Ralph\nor the maiden answered it rightly at once; and by this time the sun was\nabout to set.  So he bade them home to his house that they might eat\nand sleep there.\n\n\"But to-morrow,\" said he, \"I shall give you your last lesson from this\nbook, and thereafter ye shall go your ways to the Rock of the Fighting\nMan, and I look not for it that ye shall come to any harm on the way;\nbut whereas I seem to-day to have seen the foes of Utterbol seeking\nyou, I will lead you forth a little.\"\n\nSo they went home to the house, and he made them the most cheer that he\nmight, and spake to them in friendly and pleasant mood, so that they\nwere merry.\n\nWhen it was morning they went again to the ancient altar, and again\nthey learned lore from the Elder, till they were waxen wise in the\nmatters of the Well at the World's End, and long they sat and hearkened\nhim till it was evening again, and once more they slept in the house of\nthe Sage of Swevenham.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nAn Adventure by the Way\n\n\nWhen morrow dawned they arose betimes and did on their worldly raiment;\nand when they had eaten a morsel they made them ready for the road, and\nthe elder gave them victual for the way in their saddle-bags, saying:\n\"This shall suffice for the passing days, and when it is gone ye have\nlearned what to do.\"\n\nTherewithall they gat to horse; but Ralph would have the Elder ride his\nnag, while he went afoot by the side of Ursula.  So the Sage took his\nbidding, but smiled therewith, and said: \"Thou art a King's son and a\nfriendly young man, else had I said nay to this; for it needeth not,\nwhereas I am stronger than thou, so hath my draught of the Well dealt\nwith me.\"\n\nThus then they went their ways; but Ralph noted of Ursula that she was\nsilent and shy with him, and it irked him so much, that at last he said\nto her:  \"My friend, doth aught ail me with thee?  Wilt thou not tell\nme, so that I may amend it?  For thou are grown of few words with me\nand turnest thee from me, and seemest as if thou heedest me little.\nThou art as a fair spring morning gone cold and overcast in the\nafternoon.  What is it then? we are going a long journey together, and\nbelike shall find little help or comfort save in each other; and ill\nwill it be if we fall asunder in heart, though we be nigh in body.\"\n\nShe laughed and reddened therewithal; and then her countenance fell and\nshe looked piteously on him and said:  \"If I seemed to thee as thou\nsayest, I am sorry; for I meant not to be thus with thee as thou\ndeemest.  But so it is that I was thinking of this long journey, and of\nthee and me together in it, and how we shall be with each other if we\ncome back again alive, with all things done that we had to do.\"\n\nShe stayed her speech awhile, and seemed to find it hard to give forth\nthe word that was in her; but at last she said: \"Friend, thou must\npardon me; but that which thou sawest in me, I also seemed to see in\nthee, that thou wert grown shy and cold with me; but now I know it is\nnot so, since thou hast seen me wrongly; but that I have seen thee\nwrongly, as thou hast me.\"\n\nTherewith she reached her hand to him, and he took it and kissed it and\ncaressed it while she looked fondly at him, and they fared on sweetly\nand happily together.  But as this was a-saying and a-doing betwixt\nthem, and a while after, they had heeded the Elder little or not at\nall, though he rode on the right hand of Ralph.  And for his part the\nold man said naught to them and made as if he heard them not, when they\nspake thuswise together.\n\nNow they rode the wood on somewhat level ground for a while; then the\ntrees began to thin, and the ground grew broken; and at last it was\nvery rugged, with high hills and deep valleys, and all the land\npopulous of wild beasts, so that about sunset they heard thrice the\nroar of a lion.  But ever the Sage led them by winding ways that he\nknew, round the feet of the hills, along stream-sides for the most\npart, and by passes over the mountain-necks when they needs must, which\nwas twice in the day.\n\nDusk fell on them in a little valley, through which ran a stream bushed\nabout its edges, and which for the rest was grassy and pleasant, with\nbig sweet-chestnut trees scattered about it.\n\n\"Now,\" quoth the Elder; \"two things we have to beware of in this\nvalley, the lions first; which, though belike they will not fall upon\nweaponed men, may well make an onslaught on your horses, if they wind\nthem; and the loss of the beasts were sore to you as now.  But the\nsecond thing is the chase from Utterbol.  As to the lions, if ye build\nup a big fire, and keep somewhat aloof from the stream and its bushes,\nand tether you horses anigh the fire, ye will have no harm of them.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"but if the riders of Utterbol are anigh us, shall\nwe light a candle for them to show them the way?\"  Said the Sage: \"Were\nye by yourselves, I would bid you journey night-long, and run all risk\nrather than the risk of falling into their hands.  But whereas I am\nyour guide, I bid you kindle your fire under yonder big tree, and leave\nme to deal with the men of Utterbol; only whatso I bid you, that do ye\nstraightway.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Ralph, \"I have been bewrayed so oft of late, that I\nmust needs trust thee, or all help shall fail me.  Let us to work.\"  So\nthey fell to and built up a big bale and kindled it, and their horses\nthey tethered to the tree; and by then they had done this, dark night\nhad fallen upon them.  So they cooked their victual at the fire (for\nRalph had shot a hare by the way) and the Sage went down to the stream\nand fetched them water in a lethern budget:  \"For,\" said he, \"I know\nthe beasts of the wood and they me, and there is peace betwixt us.\"\nThere then they sat to meat unarmed, for the Sage had said to them:\n\"Doff your armour; ye shall not come to handystrokes with the Utterbol\nRiders.\"\n\nSo they ate their meat in the wilderness, and were nowise ungleeful,\nfor to those twain the world seemed fair, and they hoped for great\nthings.  But though they were glad, they were weary enough, for the way\nhad been both rugged and long; so they lay them down to sleep while the\nnight was yet young.  But or ever Ralph closed his eyes he saw the Sage\nstanding up with his cloak wrapped about his head, and making strange\nsigns with his right hand; so that he deemed that he would ward them by\nwizardry.  So therewith he turned about on the grass and was asleep at\nonce.\n\nAfter a while he started and sat up, half awake at first; for he felt\nsome one touch him; and his halfdreams went back to past days, and he\ncried out:  \"Hah Roger! is it thou?  What is toward?\" But therewith he\nwoke up fully, and knew that it was the Sage that had touched him, and\nwithal he saw hard by Ursula, sitting up also.\n\nThere was still a flickering flame playing about the red embers of\ntheir fire, for they had made it very big; and the moon had arisen and\nwas shining bright in a cloudless sky.\n\nThe Sage spake softly but quickly:  \"Lie down together, ye two, and I\nshall cast my cloak over you, and look to it that ye stir not from out\nof it, nor speak one word till I bid you, whate'er may befall: for the\nriders of Utterbol are upon us.\"\n\nThey did as he bade them, but Ralph got somewhat of an eye-shot out of\na corner of the cloak, and he could see that the Sage went and stood up\nagainst the tree-trunk holding a horse by the bridle, one on each side\nof him.  Even therewith Ralph heard the clatter of horse-hoofs over the\nstones about the stream, and a man's voice cried out: \"They will have\nheard us; so spur over the grass to the fire and the big tree:  for\nthen they cannot escape us.\" Then came the thump of horse-hoofs on the\nturf, and in half a minute they were amidst of a rout of men\na-horseback, more than a score, whose armour and weapons gleamed in the\nmoonlight: yet when these riders were gotten there, they were silent,\ntill one said in a quavering voice as if afeard: \"Otter, Otter! what is\nthis?  A minute ago and we could see the fire, and the tree, and men\nand horses about them: and now, lo you! there is naught save two great\ngrey stones lying on the grass, and a man's bare bones leaning up\nagainst the tree, and a ruckle of old horse-bones on either side of\nhim.  Where are we then?\"\n\nThen spake another; and Ralph knew the voice for Otter's: \"I wot not,\nlord; naught else is changed save the fire and the horses and the men:\nyonder are the hills, yonder overhead is the moon, with the little\nlight cloud dogging her; even that is scarce changed.  Belike the fire\nwas an earth-fire, and for the rest we saw wrong in the moonlight.\"\n\nSpake the first man again, and his voice quavered yet more: \"Nay nay,\nOtter, it is not so.  Lo you the skeleton and the bones and the grey\nstones!  And the fire, here this minute, there the next.  O Otter, this\nis an evil place of an evil deed!  Let us go seek elsewhere; let us\ndepart, lest a worse thing befall us.\" And so with no more ado he\nturned his horse and smote his spurs into him and galloped off by the\nway he had come, and the others followed, nothing loth; only Otter\ntarried a little, and looked around him and laughed and said: \"There\ngoes my Lord's nephew; like my Lord he is not over bold, save in\ndealing with a shackled man.  Well, for my part if those others have\nsunk into the earth, or gone up into the air, they are welcome to their\nwizardry, and I am glad of it.  For I know not how I should have done\nto have seen my mate that out-tilted me made a gelded wretch of; and it\nwould have irked me to see that fair woman in the hands of the\ntormentors, though forsooth I have oft seen such sights.  Well, it is\ngood; but better were it to ride with my mate than serve the Devil and\nhis Nephew.\"\n\nTherewith he turned rein and galloped off after the others, and in a\nlittle while the sound of them had died off utterly into the night, and\nthey heard but the voices of the wild things, and the wimbrel laughing\nfrom the hill-sides. Then came the Sage and drew the cloak from those\ntwo, and laughed on them and said: \"Now may ye sleep soundly, when I\nhave mended our fire; for ye will see no more of Utterbol for this\ntime, and it yet lacks three hours of dawn:  sleep ye then and dream of\neach other.\" Then they arose and thanked the Sage with whole hearts and\npraised his wisdom.  But while the old man mended the fire Ralph went\nup to Ursula and took her hand, and said: \"Welcome to life,\nfellow-farer!\" and he gazed earnestly into her eyes, as though he would\nhave her fall into his arms: but whereas she rather shrank from him,\nthough she looked on him lovingly, if somewhat shyly, he but kissed her\nhand, and laid him down again, when he had seen her lying in her place.\nAnd therewith they fell asleep and slept sweetly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nThey Come to the Sea of Molten Rocks\n\n\nWhen they woke again the sun was high above their heads, and they saw\nthe Sage dighting their breakfast.  So they arose and washed the night\noff them in the stream and ate hastily, and got to horse on a fair\nforenoon; then they rode the mountain neck east from that valley; and\nit was a long slope of stony and barren mountain nigh waterless.\n\nAnd on the way Ursula told Ralph how the man who was scared by the\nwizardry last night was verily the nephew of the Lord from whom she had\nstolen her armour by wheedling and a seeming promise.  \"But,\" said she,\n\"his love lay not so deep but that he would have avenged him for my\nguile on my very body had he taken us.\" Ralph reddened and scowled at\nher word, and the Sage led them into the other talk.\n\nSo long was that fell, that they were nigh benighted ere they gained\nthe topmost, or came to any pass.  When they had come to a place where\nthere was a little pool in a hollow of the rocks they made stay there,\nand slept safe, but ill-lodged, and on the morrow were on their way\nbetimes, and went toiling up the neck another four hours, and came to a\nlong rocky ridge or crest that ran athwart it; and when they had come\nto the brow thereof, then were they face to face with the Great\nMountains, which now looked so huge that they seemed to fill all the\nworld save the ground whereon they stood.  Cloudless was the day, and\nthe air clean and sweet, and every nook and cranny was clear to behold\nfrom where they stood: there were great jutting nesses with\nstraight-walled burgs at their top-most, and pyramids and pinnacles\nthat no hand of man had fashioned, and awful clefts like long streets\nin the city of the giants who wrought the world, and high above all the\nundying snow that looked as if the sky had come down on to the\nmountains and they were upholding it as a roof.\n\nBut clear as was the fashion of the mountains, they were yet a long way\noff:  for betwixt them and the ridge whereon those fellows stood,\nstretched a vast plain, houseless and treeless, and, as they beheld it\nthence grey and ungrassed (though indeed it was not wholly so) like a\nhuge river or firth of the sea it seemed, and such indeed it had been\nonce, to wit a flood of molten rock in the old days when the earth was\na-burning.\n\nNow as they stood and beheld it, the Sage spake: \"Lo ye, my children,\nthe castle and its outwork, and its dyke that wardeth the land of the\nWell at the World's End.  Now from to-morrow, when we enter into the\ngreat sea of the rock molten in the ancient earth-fires, there is no\nleast peril of pursuit for you.  Yet amidst that sea should ye perish\nbelike, were it not for the wisdom gathered by a few; and they are dead\nnow save for the Book, and for me, who read it unto you.  Now ye would\nnot turn back were I to bid you, and I will not bid you.  Yet since the\njourney shall be yet with grievous toil and much peril, and shall try\nthe very hearts within you, were ye as wise as Solomon and as mighty as\nAlexander, I will say this much unto you; that if ye love not the earth\nand the world with all your souls, and will not strive all ye may to be\nfrank and happy therein, your toil and peril aforesaid shall win you no\nblessing but a curse.  Therefore I bid you be no tyrants or builders of\ncities for merchants and usurers and warriors and thralls, like the\nfool who builded Goldburg to be for a tomb to him: or like the\nthrall-masters of the Burg of the Four Friths, who even now, it may be,\nare pierced by their own staff or overwhelmed by their own wall.  But\nrather I bid you to live in peace and patience without fear or hatred,\nand to succour the oppressed and love the lovely, and to be the friends\nof men, so that when ye are dead at last, men may say of you, they\nbrought down Heaven to the Earth for a little while.  What say ye,\nchildren?\"\n\nThen said Ralph:  \"Father, I will say the sooth about mine intent,\nthough ye may deem it little-minded. When I have accomplished this\nquest, I would get me home again to the little land of Upmeads, to see\nmy father and my mother, and to guard its meadows from waste and its\nhouses from fire-raising: to hold war aloof and walk in free fields,\nand see my children growing up about me, and lie at last beside my\nfathers in the choir of St. Laurence.  The dead would I love and\nremember; the living would I love and cherish; and Earth shall be the\nwell beloved house of my Fathers, and Heaven the highest hall thereof.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said the Sage, \"all this shalt thou do and be no\nlittle-heart, though thou do no more.  And thou, maiden?\"\n\nShe looked on Ralph and said:  \"I lost, and then I found, and then I\nlost again.  Maybe I shall find the lost once more.  And for the rest,\nin all that this man will do, I will help, living or dead, for I know\nnaught better to do.\"\n\n\"Again it is well,\" said the Sage, \"and the lost which was verily thine\nshalt thou find again, and good days and their ending shall betide\nthee.  Ye shall have no shame in your lives and no fear in your deaths.\nWherefore now lieth the road free before you.\"\n\nThen was he silent a while, neither spake the others aught, but stood\ngazing on the dark grey plain, and the blue wall that rose beyond it,\ntill at last the Sage lifted up his hand and said: \"Look yonder,\nchildren, to where I point, and ye shall see how there thrusteth out a\nness from the mountain-wall, and the end of it stands like a bastion\nabove the lava-sea, and on its sides and its head are streaks ruddy and\ntawny, where the earth-fires have burnt not so long ago:  see ye?\"\n\nRalph looked and said:  \"Yea, father, I see it, and its rifts and its\nridges, and its crannies.\"\n\nQuoth the Sage:  \"Behind that ness shall ye come to the Rock of the\nFighting Man, which is the very Gate of the Mountains; and I will not\nturn again nor bid you farewell till I have brought you thither.  And\nnow time presses; for I would have you come timely to that cavern,\nwhereof I have taught you, before ye fall on the first days of winter,\nor ye shall be hard bestead.  So now we will eat a morsel, and then use\ndiligence that we may reach the beginning of the rock-sea before\nnightfall.\"\n\nSo did they, and the Sage led them down by a slant-way from off the\nridge, which was toilsome but nowise perilous.  So about sunset they\ncame down into the plain, and found a belt of greensward, and waters\ntherein betwixt the foot of the ridge and the edge of the rock-sea. And\nas for the said sea, though from afar it looked plain and unbroken, now\nthat they were close to, and on a level with it, they saw that it rose\nup into cliffs, broken down in some places, and in others arising high\ninto the air, an hundred foot, it might be.  Sometimes it thrust out\ninto the green shore below the fell, and otherwhile drew back from it\nas it had cooled ages ago.\n\nSo they came to a place where there was a high wall of rock round three\nsides of a grassy place by a stream-side, and there they made their\nresting-place, and the night went calmly and sweetly with them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nThey Come Forth From the Rock-Sea\n\n\nOn the morrow the Sage led them straight into the rock-sea whereas it\nseemed to them at first that he was but bringing them into a blind\nalley; but at the end of the bight the rock-wall was broken down into a\nlong scree of black stones.  There the Sage bade Ralph and Ursula\ndismount (as for him he had been going afoot ever since that first day)\nand they led the horses up the said scree, which was a hard business,\nas they were no mountain beasts.  And when they were atop of the scree\nit was harder yet to get them down, for on that side it was steeper;\nbut at last they brought it about, and came down into a little grassy\nplain or isle in the rock sea, which narrowed toward the eastern end,\nand the rocks on either side were smooth and glossy, as if the heat had\ngone out of them suddenly, when the earth-fires had ceased in the\nmountains.\n\nNow the Sage showed them on a certain rock a sign cut, whereof they had\nlearned in the book aforesaid, to wit, a sword crossed by a\nthree-leaved bough; and they knew by the book that they should press on\nthrough the rock-sea nowhere, either going or returning, save where\nthey should see this token.\n\nNow when they came to the narrow end of the plain they found still a\nwide way between the rock-walls, that whiles widened out, and whiles\ndrew in again.  Whiles withal were screes across the path, and little\nwaters that ran out of the lava and into it again, and great blocks of\nfallen stone, sometimes as big as a husbandman's cot, that wind and\nweather had rent from the rocks; and all these things stayed them\nsomewhat.  But they went on merrily, albeit their road winded so much,\nthat the Sage told them, when evening was, that for their diligence\nthey had but come a few short miles as the crow flies.\n\nMany wild things there were, both beast and fowl, in these islands and\nbridges of the rock-sea, hares and conies to wit, a many, and\nheathfowl, and here and there a red fox lurking about the crannies of\nthe rock-wall. Ralph shot a brace of conies with his Turk bow, and\nwhereas there were bushes growing in the chinks, and no lack of whin\nand ling, they had firing enough, and supped off this venison of the\nrocks.\n\nSo passed that day and two days more, and naught befell, save that on\nthe midnight of the first day of their wending the rock-sea, Ralph\nawoke and saw the sky all ablaze with other light than that of the\nmoon; so he arose and went hastily to the Sage, and took him by the\nshoulder, and bid him awake; \"For meseems the sky is afire, and\nperchance the foe is upon us.\"\n\nThe Sage awoke and opened his eyes, and rose on his elbow and looked\naround sleepily; then he said laughing:  \"It is naught, fair lord, thou\nmayst lie down and sleep out the remnant of the night, and thou also,\nmaiden:  this is but an earth-fire breaking out on the flank of the\nmountains; it may be far away hence.  Now ye see that he may not scale\nthe rocks about us here without toil; but to-morrow night we may climb\nup somewhere and look on what is toward.\"\n\nSo Ralph lay down and Ursula also, but Ralph lay long awake watching\nthe light above him, which grew fiercer and redder in the hours betwixt\nmoonset and daybreak, when he fell asleep, and woke not again till the\nsun was high.\n\nBut on the next day as they went, the aspect of the rock-sea about them\nchanged:  for the rocks were not so smooth and shining and orderly, but\nrose up in confused heaps all clotted together by the burning, like to\nclinkers out of some monstrous forge of the earth-giants, so that their\nway was naught so clear as it had been, but was rather a maze of jagged\nstone.  But the Sage led through it all unfumbling, and moreover now\nand again they came on that carven token of the sword and the bough.\nNight fell, and as it grew dark they saw the glaring of the earth-fires\nagain; and when they were rested, and had done their meat, the Sage\nsaid: \"Come now with me, for hard by is there a place as it were a\nstair that goeth to the top of a great rock, let us climb it and look\nabout us.\"\n\nSo did they, and the head of the rock was higher than the main face of\nthe rock-sea, so that they could see afar.  Thence they looked north\nand beheld afar off a very pillar of fire rising up from a ness of the\nmountain wall, and seeming as if it bore up a black roof of smoke; and\nthe huge wall gleamed grey, because of its light, and it cast a ray of\nlight across the rock-sea as the moon doth over the waters of the deep:\nwithal there was the noise as of thunder in the air, but afar off:\nwhich thunder indeed they had heard oft, as they rode through the\nafternoon and evening.\n\nSpake the Sage:  \"It is far away:  yet if the wind were not blowing\nfrom us, we had smelt the smoke, and the sky had been darkened by it.\nNow it is naught so far from Utterbol, and it will be for a token to\nthem there.  For that ness is called the Candle of the Giants, and men\ndeem that the kindling thereof forebodeth ill to the lord who sitteth\non the throne in the red hall of Utterbol.\"\n\nRalph laid his hand on Ursula's shoulder and said: \"May the Sage's saw\nbe sooth!\"\n\nShe put her hand upon the hand and said:  \"Three months ago I lay on my\nbed at Bourton Abbas, and all the while here was this huge manless\nwaste lying under the bare heavens and threatened by the storehouse of\nthe fires of the earth: and I had not seen it, nor thee either, O\nfriend; and now it hath become a part of me for ever.\"\n\nThen was Ralph exceeding glad of her words, and the Sage laughed\ninwardly when he beheld them thus.\n\nSo they came adown from the rock and lay down presently under the fiery\nheavens:  and their souls were comforted by the sound of the horses\ncropping the grass so close to their ears, that it broke the voice of\nthe earth-fires' thunder, that ever and anon rolled over the grey sea\namidst which they lay.\n\nOn the morrow they still rode the lava like to clinkers, and it rose\nhigher about them, till suddenly nigh sunset it ended at a turn of\ntheir winding road, and naught lay betwixt them and that mighty ness of\nthe mountains, save a wide grassy plain, here and there swelling into\nlow wide risings not to be called hills, and besprinkled with copses of\nbushes, and with trees neither great nor high.  Then spake the Sage:\n\"Here now will we rest, and by my will to-morrow also, that your beasts\nmay graze their fill of the sweet grass of these unwarded meadows.\nwhich feedeth many a herd unowned of man, albeit they pay a quit-rent\nto wild things that be mightier than they.  And now, children, we have\npassed over the mighty river that once ran molten betwixt these\nmountains and the hills yonder to the west, which we trod the other\nday; yet once more, if your hearts fail you, there is yet time to turn\nback; and no harm shall befall you, but I will be your fellow all the\nway home to Swevenham if ye will.  But if ye still crave the water of\nthe Well at the World's End, I will lead you over this green plain, and\nthen go back home to mine hermitage, and abide there till ye come to\nme, or I die.\"\n\nRalph smiled and said:  \"Master, no such sorry story shall I bear back\nto Upmeads, that after many sorrows borne, and perils overcome, I came\nto the Gates of the Mountains, and turned back for fear of that which I\nhad not proved.\"\n\nSo spake he; but Ursula laughed and said:  \"Yea, then should I deem thy\nfriendship light if thou leftest me alone and unholpen in the uttermost\nwilderness; and thy manhood light to turn back from that which did not\nmake a woman afraid.\"\n\nThen the Sage looked kindly on them and said:  \"Yea, then is the last\nword spoken, and the world may yet grow merrier to me.  Look you, some\nthere be who may abuse the gifts of the Well for evil errands, and some\nwho may use it for good deeds; but I am one who hath not dared to use\nit lest I should abuse it, I being alone amongst weaklings and fools:\nbut now if ye come back, who knows but that I may fear no longer, but\nuse my life, and grow to be a mighty man.  Come now, let us dight our\nsupper, and kindle as big a fire as we lightly may; since there is many\na prowling beast about, as bear and lynx and lion; for they haunt this\nedge of the rock-sea whereto the harts and the wild bulls and the goats\nresort for the sweet grass, and the water that floweth forth from the\nlava.\"\n\nSo they cut good store of firing, whereas there was a plenty of bushes\ngrowing in the clefts of the rocks, and they made a big fire and\ntethered their horses anigh it when they lay down to rest; and in the\nnight they heard the roaring of wild things round about them, and more\nthan once or twice, awakening before day, they saw the shape of some\nterrible creature by the light of the moon mingled with the glare of\nthe earth-fires, but none of these meddled with them, and naught befell\nthem save the coming of the new day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nThey Come to the Gate of the Mountains\n\n\nThat day they herded their horses thereabout, and from time to time the\nSage tried those two if they were perfect in the lore of the road; and\nhe found that they had missed nothing.\n\nThey lay down in the self-same place again that night, and arose\nbetimes on the morrow and went their ways over the plain as the Sage\nled, till it was as if the mountains and their terror hung over their\nvery heads, and the hugeness and blackness of them were worse than a\nwall of fire had been.  It was still a long way to them, so that it was\nnot till noon of the third day from the rock-sea that they came to the\nvery feet of that fire-scorched ness, and wonderful indeed it seemed to\nthem that anything save the eagles could have aught to tell of what lay\nbeyond it.\n\nThere were no foothills or downs betwixt the plain and the mountains,\nnaught save a tumble of rocks that had fallen from the cliffs, piled up\nstrangely, and making a maze through which the Sage led them surely;\nand at last they were clear even of this, and were underneath the flank\nof that ness, which was so huge that there seemed that there could\nscarce be any more mountain than that.  Little of its huge height could\nthey see, now they were close to it, for it went up sheer at first and\nthen beetled over them till they could see no more of its side; as they\nwound about its flank, and they were long about it, the Sage cried out\nto those two and stretched out his hand, and behold! the side of the\nblack cliff plain and smooth and shining as if it had been done by the\nhand of men or giants, and on this smooth space was carven in the\nliving rock the image of a warrior in mail and helm of ancient fashion,\nand holding a sword in his right hand.  From head to heel he seemed\nsome sixty feet high, and the rock was so hard, that he was all clean\nand clear to see; and they deemed of him that his face was keen and\nstern of aspect.\n\nSo there they stood in an awful bight of the mountain, made by that\nness, and the main wall from which it thrust out.  But after they had\ngazed awhile and their hearts were in their mouths, the Sage turned on\nthose twain and said: \"Here then is the end of my journey with you; and\nye wot all that I can tell you, and I can say no word more save to bid\nyou cast all fear aside and thrive.  Ye have yet for this day's journey\ncertain hours of such daylight as the mountain pass will give you,\nwhich at the best is little better than twilight; therefore redeem ye\nthe time.\"\n\nBut Ralph got off his horse, and Ursula did in likewise, and they both\nkissed and embraced the old man, for their hearts were full and fain.\nBut he drew himself away from them, and turned about with no word more,\nand went his ways, and presently was hidden from their eyes by the\nrocky maze which lay about the mountain's foot.  Then the twain mounted\ntheir horses again and set forth silently on the road, as they had been\nbidden.\n\nIn a little while the rocks of the pass closed about them, leaving but\na way so narrow that they could see a glimmer of the stars above them\nas they rode the twilight; no sight they had of the measureless stony\ndesert, yet in their hearts they saw it.  They seemed to be wending a\nstraight-walled prison without an end, so that they were glad when the\ndark night came on them.\n\nRalph found some shelter in the cleft of a rock above a mound where was\nlittle grass for the horses.  He drew Ursula into it, and they sat down\nthere on the stones together.  So long they sat silent that a great\ngloom settled upon Ralph, and he scarce knew whether he were asleep or\nwaking, alive or dead.  But amidst of it fell a sweet voice on his\nears, and familiar words asking him of what like were the fields of\nUpmeads, and the flowers; and of the fish of its water, and of the\nfashion of the building of his father's house; and of his brethren, and\nthe mother that bore him.  Then was it to him at first as if a sweet\ndream had come across the void of his gloom, and then at last the gloom\nand the dread and the deadness left him, and he knew that his friend\nand fellow was talking to him, and that he sat by her knee to knee, and\nthe sweetness of her savoured in his nostrils as she leaned her face\ntoward him, and he knew himself for what he was; and yet for memory of\nthat past horror, and the sweetness of his friend and what not else, he\nfell a-weeping. But Ursula bestirred herself and brought out food from\nher wallet, and sat down beside him again, and he wiped the tears from\nhis eyes and laughed, and chid himself for being as a child in the\ndark, and then they ate and drank together in that dusk nook of the\nwilderness.  And now was he happy and his tongue was loosed, and he\nfell to telling her many things of Upmeads, and of the tale of his\nforefathers, and of his old loves and his friends, till life and death\nseemed to him as they had seemed of time past in the merry land of his\nbirth.  So there anon they fell asleep for weariness, and no dreams of\nterror beset their slumbers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nThey Come to the Vale of Sweet Chestnuts\n\n\nWhen they went on their way next morning they found little change in\nthe pass, and they rode the dread highway daylong, and it was still the\nsame: so they rested a little before nightfall at a place where there\nwas water running out of the rocks, but naught else for their avail.\nRalph was merry and helpful and filled water from the runnel, and\nwrought what he might to make the lodging meet; and as they ate and\nrested he said to Ursula:  \"Last night it was thou that beguiled me of\nmy gloom, yet thereafter till we slept it was my voice for the more\npart, and not thine, that was heard in the wilderness.  Now to-night it\nshall be otherwise, and I will but ask a question of thee, and hearken\nto the sweetness of thy voice.\"\n\nShe laughed a little and very sweetly, and she said: \"Forsooth, dear\nfriend, I spoke to thee that I might hear thy voice for the more part,\nand not mine, that was heard in the desert; but when I heard thee, I\ndeemed that the world was yet alive for us to come back to.\"\n\nHe was silent awhile, for his heart was pierced with the sweetness of\nher speech, and he had fain have spoken back as sweetly as a man might;\nyet he could not because he feared her somewhat, lest she should turn\ncold to him; therefore himseemed that he spoke roughly, as he said:\n\"Nevertheless, my friend, I beseech thee to tell me of thine old home,\neven as last night I told thee of mine.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"with a good will.\"  And straightway she fell to\ntelling him of her ways when she was little, and of her father and\nmother, and of her sister that had died, and the brother whom Ralph had\nseen at Bourton Abbas: she told also of bachelors who had wooed her,\nand jested concerning them, yet kindly and without malice, and talked\nso sweetly and plainly, that the wilderness was become a familiar place\nto Ralph, and he took her hand in the dusk and said: \"But, my friend,\nhow was it with the man for whom thou wert weeping when I first fell in\nwith thee at Bourton Abbas?\"\n\nShe said:  \"I will tell thee plainly, as a friend may to a friend.\nThree hours had not worn from thy departure ere tidings came to me\nconcerning him, that neither death nor wounding had befallen him; and\nthat his masterless horse and bloodstained saddle were but a device to\nthrow dust into our eyes, so that there might be no chase after him by\nthe men of the Abbot's bailiff, and that he might lightly do as he\nwould, to wit, swear himself into the riders of the Burg of the Four\nFriths; for, in sooth, he was weary of me and mine.  Yet further, I\nmust needs tell thee that I know now, that when I wept before thee it\nwas partly in despite, because I had found out in my heart (though I\nbade it not tell me so much) that I loved him but little.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and when didst thou come to that knowledge of thine\nheart?\"\n\n\"Dear friend,\" she said, \"mayhappen I may tell thee hereafter, but as\nnow I will forbear.\"  He laughed for joy of her, and in a little that\ntalk fell down between them.\n\nDespite the terror of the desert and the lonely ways, when Ralph laid\nhim down on his stony bed, happiness wrapped his heart about.  Albeit\nall this while he durst not kiss or caress her, save very measurely,\nfor he deemed that she would not suffer it; nor as yet would he ask her\nwherefore, though he had it in his mind that he would not always\nforbear to ask her.\n\nMany days they rode that pass of the mountains, though it was not\nalways so evil and dreadful as at the first beginning; for now again\nthe pass opened out into little valleys, wherein was foison of grass\nand sweet waters withal, and a few trees.  In such places must they\nneeds rest them, to refresh their horses as well as themselves, and to\ngather food, of venison, and wild-fruit and nuts.  But abiding in such\nvales was very pleasant to them.\n\nAt last these said valleys came often and oftener, till it was so that\nall was pretty much one valley, whiles broken by a mountain neck,\nwhiles straitened by a ness of the mountains that jutted into it, but\nnever quite blind:  yet was the said valley very high up, and as it\nwere a trench of the great mountain.  So they were glad that they had\nescaped from that strait prison betwixt the rock-walls, and were well\nat ease: and they failed never to find the tokens that led them on the\nway, even as they had learned of the Sage, so that they were not\nbeguiled into any straying.\n\nAnd now they had worn away thirty days since they had parted from the\nSage, and the days began to shorten and the nights to lengthen apace;\nwhen on the forenoon of a day, after they had ridden a very rugged\nmountain-neck, they came down and down into a much wider valley into\nwhich a great reef of rocks thrust out from the high mountain, so that\nthe northern half of the said vale was nigh cleft atwain by it; well\ngrassed was the vale, and a fair river ran through it, and there were\non either side the water great groves of tall and great sweet-chestnuts\nand walnut trees, whereon the nuts were now ripe.  They rejoiced as\nthey rode into it; for they remembered how the Sage had told them\nthereof, that their travel and toil should be stayed there awhile, and\nthat there they should winter, because of the bread which they could\nmake them of the chestnuts, and the plenty of walnuts, and that withal\nthere was foison of venison.\n\nSo they found a ford of the river and crossed it, and went straight to\nthe head of the rocky ness, being shown thither by the lore of the\nSage, and they found in the face of the rock the mouth of a cavern, and\nbeside it the token of the sword and the branch.  Therefore they knew\nthat they had come to their winter house, and they rejoiced thereat,\nand without more ado they got off their horses and went into the\ncavern.  The entry thereof was low, so that they must needs creep into\nit, but within it was a rock-hall, high, clean and sweet-smelling.\n\nThere then they dight their dwelling, doing all they might to be done\nwith their work before the winter was upon them.  The day after they\nhad come there they fell to on the in-gathering of their chestnut\nharvest, and they dried them, and made them into meal; and the walnuts\nthey gathered also.  Withal they hunted the deer, both great and small;\namongst which Ralph, not without some peril, slew two great bears, of\nwhich beasts, indeed, there was somewhat more than enough, as they came\ninto the dale to feed upon the nuts and the berry-trees. So they soon\nhad good store of peltries for their beds and their winter raiment,\nwhich Ursula fell to work on deftly, for she knew all the craft of\nneedlework; and, shortly to tell it, they had enough and to spare of\nvictual and raiment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nWinter Amidst of the Mountains\n\n\nIn all this they had enough to be busy with, so that time hung not\nheavy on their hands, and the shadow of the Quest was nowise burdensome\nto them, since they wotted that they had to abide the wearing of the\ndays till spring was come with fresh tidings.  Their labour was nowise\nirksome to them, since Ralph was deft in all manner of sports and\ncrafts, such as up-country folk follow, and though he were a king's\nson, he had made a doughty yeoman: and as for Ursula, she also was\ncountry-bred, of a lineage of field-folk, and knew all the manners of\nthe fields.\n\nWithal in whatsoever way it were, they loved each other dearly, and all\nkind of speech flowed freely betwixt them.  Sooth to say, Ralph, taking\nheed of Ursula, deemed that she were fain to love him bodily, and he\nwotted well by now, that, whatever had befallen, he loved her, body and\nsoul.  Yet still was that fear of her naysay lurking in his heart, if\nhe should kiss her, or caress her, as a man with a maid.  Therefore he\nforbore, though desire of her tormented him grievously at whiles.\n\nThey wore their armour but little now, save when they were about some\njourney wherein was peril of wild beasts.  Ursula had dight her some\ndue woman's raiment betwixt her knight's surcoat and doe-skins which\nthey had gotten, so that it was not unseemly of fashion.  As for their\nhorses, they but seldom backed them, but used them to draw stuff to\ntheir rock-house on sledges, which they made of tree-boughs; so that\nthe beasts grew fat, feeding on the grass of the valley and the\nwild-oats withal, which grew at the upper end of the bight of the\nvalley, toward the northern mountains, where the ground was sandy.  No\nman they saw, nor any signs of man, nor had they seen any save the\nSage, since those riders of Utterbol had vanished before them into the\nnight.\n\nSo wore autumn into winter, and the frost came, and the snow, with\nprodigious winds from out of the mountains: yet was not the weather so\nhard but that they might go forth most days, and come to no hurt if\nthey were wary of the drifts; and forsooth needs must they go abroad to\ntake venison for their livelihood.\n\nSo the winter wore also amidst sweet speech and friendliness betwixt\nthe two, and they lived still as dear friends, and not as lovers.\n\nSeldom they spoke of the Quest, for it seemed to them now a matter over\ngreat for speech.  But now they were grown so familiar each to each\nthat Ursula took heart to tell Ralph more of the tidings of Utterbol,\nfor now the shame and grief of her bondage there was but as a story\ntold of another, so far away seemed that time from this.  But so\ngrievous was her tale that Ralph grew grim thereover, and he said: \"By\nSt. Nicholas! it were a good deed, once we are past the mountains\nagain, to ride to Utterbol and drag that swine and wittol from his hall\nand slay him, and give his folk a good day.  But then there is thou, my\nfriend, and how shall I draw thee into deadly strife?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she said, \"whereso thou ridest thither will I, and one fate\nshall lie on us both.  We will think thereof and ask the Sage of it\nwhen we return.  Who knows what shall have befallen then?  Remember the\nlighting of the candle of Utterbol that we saw from the Rock-sea, and\nthe boding thereof.\" So Ralph was appeased for that time.\n\nOft also they spake of the little lands whence they came, and on a time\namidst of such talk Ursula said:  \"But alas, friend, why do I speak of\nall this, when now save for my brother, who loveth me but after a\nfashion, to wit that I must in all wise do his bidding, lad as he is, I\nhave no longer kith nor kin there, save again as all the folk of one\nstead are somewhat akin.  I think, my dear, that I have no country, nor\nany house to welcome me.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"All lands, any land that thou mayst come to, shall\nwelcome thee, and I shall look to it that so it shall be.\" And in his\nheart he thought of the welcome of Upmeads, and of Ursula sitting on\nthe dais of the hall of the High-House.\n\nSo wore the days till Candlemass, when the frost broke and the snows\nbegan to melt, and the waters came down from the mountains, so that the\nriver rose over its banks and its waters covered the plain parts of the\nvalley, and those two could go dryshod but a little way out of their\ncavern; no further than the green mound or toft which lay at the mouth\nthereof: but the waters were thronged with fowl, as mallard and teal\nand coots, and of these they took what they would.  Whiles also they\nwaded the shallows of the flood, and whiles poled a raft about it, and\nso had pleasure of the waters as before they had had of the snow.  But\nwhen at last the very spring was come, and the grass began to grow\nafter the showers had washed the plain of the waterborne mud, and the\nsnowdrop had thrust up and blossomed, and the celandine had come, and\nthen when the blackthorn bloomed and the Lent-lilies hid the grass\nbetwixt the great chestnut-boles, when the sun shone betwixt the\nshowers and the west wind blew, and the throstles and blackbirds ceased\nnot their song betwixt dawn and dusk, then began Ralph to say to\nhimself, that even if the Well at the World's End were not, and all\nthat the Sage had told them was but a tale of Swevenham, yet were all\nbetter than well if Ursula were but to him a woman beloved rather than\na friend.  And whiles he was pensive and silent, even when she was by\nhim, and she noted it and forbore somewhat the sweetness of her\nglances, and the caressing of her soft speech:  though oft when he\nlooked on her fondly, the blood would rise to her cheeks, and her bosom\nwould heave with the thought of his desire, which quickened hers so\nsorely, that it became a pain and grief to her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nOf Ursula and the Bear\n\n\nIt befell on a fair sunny morning of spring, that Ralph sat alone on\nthe toft by the rock-house, for Ursula had gone down the meadow to\ndisport her and to bathe in the river.  Ralph was fitting the blade of\na dagger to a long ashen shaft, to make him a strong spear; for with\nthe waxing spring the bears were often in the meadows again; and the\nday before they had come across a family of the beasts in the sandy\nbight under the mountains; to wit a carle, and a quean with her cubs;\nthe beasts had seen them but afar off, and whereas the men were two and\nthe sun shone back from their weapons, they had forborne them; although\nthey were fierce and proud in those wastes, and could not away with\ncreatures that were not of their kind.  So because of this Ralph had\nbidden Ursula not to fare abroad without her sword, which was sharp and\nstrong, and she no weakling withal.  He bethought him of this just as\nhe had made an end of his spear-shaping, so therewith he looked aside\nand saw the said sword hanging to a bough of a little quicken-tree,\nwhich grew hard by the door.  Fear came into his heart therewith, so he\narose and strode down over the meadow hastily bearing his new spear,\nand girt with his sword.  Now there was a grove of chestnuts betwixt\nhim and the river, but on the other side of them naught but the green\ngrass down to the water's edge.\n\nSure enough as he came under the trees he heard a shrill cry, and knew\nthat it could be naught save Ursula; so he ran thitherward whence came\nthe cry, shouting as he ran, and was scarce come out of the trees ere\nhe saw Ursula indeed, mother-naked, held in chase by a huge bear as big\nas a bullock:  he shouted again and ran the faster; but even therewith,\nwhether she heard and saw him, and hoped for timely help, or whether\nshe felt her legs failing her, she turned on the bear, and Ralph saw\nthat she had a little axe in her hand wherewith she smote hardily at\nthe beast; but he, after the fashion of his kind, having risen to his\nhind legs, fenced with his great paws like a boxer, and smote the axe\nout of her hand, and she cried out bitterly and swerved from him and\nfell a running again; but the bear tarried not, and would have caught\nher in a few turns; but even therewith was Ralph come up, who thrust\nthe beast into the side with his long-headed spear, and not waiting to\npull it out again, drew sword in a twinkling, and smote a fore-paw off\nhim and then drave the sword in over the shoulder so happily that it\nreached his heart, and he fell over dead with a mighty thump.\n\nThen Ralph looked around for Ursula; but she had already run back to\nthe river-side and was casting her raiment on her; so he awaited her\nbeside the slain bear, but with drawn sword, lest the other bear should\ncome upon them; for this was the he-bear. Howbeit he saw naught save\npresently Ursula all clad and coming towards him speedily; so he turned\ntoward her, and when they met he cast himself upon her without a word,\nand kissed her greedily; and she forbore not at all, but kissed and\ncaressed him as if she could never be satisfied.\n\nSo at last they drew apart a little, and walked quietly toward the\nrock-house hand in hand.  And on the way she told him that even as she\ncame up on to the bank from the water she saw the bear coming down on\nher as fast as he could drive, and so she but caught up her axe, and\nran for it:  \"Yet I had little hope, dear friend,\" she said, \"but that\nthou shouldst be left alone in the wilderness.\" And therewith she\nturned on him and cast her arms about him again, all weeping for joy of\ntheir two lives.\n\nThus slowly they came before the door of their rock-house and Ralph\nsaid: \"Let us sit down here on the grass, and if thou art not over\nwearied with the flight and the battle, I will ask thee a question.\"\nShe laid herself down on the grass with a sigh, yet it was as of one\nwho sighs for pleasure and rest, and said, as he sat down beside her:\n\"I am fain to rest my limbs and my body, but my heart is at rest; so\nask on, dear friend.\"\n\nThe song of birds was all around them, and the scent of many blossoms\nwent past on the wings of the west wind, and Ralph was silent a little\nas he looked at the loveliness of his friend; then he said:  \"This is\nthe question; of what kind are thy kisses this morning, are they the\nkisses of a friend or a lover?  Wilt thou not called me beloved and not\nfriend?  Shall not we two lie on the bridal bed this same night?\"\n\nShe looked on him steadily, smiling, but for love and sweetness, not\nfor shame and folly; then she said:  \"O, dear friend and dearest lover,\nthree questions are these and not one; but I will answer all three as\nmy heart biddeth me.  And first, I will tell thee that my kisses are as\nthine; and if thine are aught but the kisses of love, then am I\nbefooled.  And next, I say that if thou wilt be my friend indeed, I\nwill not spare to call thee beloved, or to be all thy friend.  But as\nto thy third question; tell me, is there not time enough for that?\"\n\nShe faltered as she spake, but he said:  \"Look, beloved, and see how\nfair the earth is to-day! What place and what season can be goodlier\nthan this?  And were it not well that we who love each other should\nhave our full joy out of this sweet season, which as now is somewhat\nmarred by our desire?\"\n\n\"Ah, beloved!\" she said, looking shyly at him, \"is it so marred by that\nwhich marreth not us?\"\n\n\"Hearken!\" he said; \"how much longer shall this fairness and peace, and\nour leisure and safety endure?  Here and now the earth rejoiceth about\nus, and there is none to say us nay; but to-morrow it may all be\notherwise.  Bethink thee, dear, if but an hour ago the monster had\nslain thee, and rent thee ere we had lain in each other's arms!\"\n\n\"Alas!\" she said, \"and had I lain in thine arms an hundred times, or an\nhundred times an hundred, should not the world be barren to me, wert\nthou gone from it, and that could never more be?  But thou friend, thou\nwell-beloved, fain were I to do thy will that thou mightest be the\nhappier...and I withal.  And if thou command it, be it so!  Yet now\nshould I tell thee all my thought, and it is on my mind, that for a\nmany hundreds of years, yea, while our people were yet heathen, when a\nman should wed a maid all the folk knew of it, and were witnesses of\nthe day and the hour thereof:  now thou knowest that the time draws\nnigh when we may look for those messengers of the Innocent Folk, who\ncome every spring to this cave to see if there be any whom they may\nspeed on the way to the Well at the World's End.  Therefore if thou\nwilt (and not otherwise) I would abide their coming if it be not over\nlong delayed; so that there may be others to witness our wedding\nbesides God, and those his creatures who dwell in the wilderness.  Yet\nshall all be as thou wilt.\"\n\n\"How shall I not do after thy bidding?\" said Ralph.  \"I will abide\ntheir coming:  yet would that they were here to-day! And one thing I\nwill pray of thee, that because of them thou wilt not forbear, or cause\nme to forbear, such kissing and caressing as is meet betwixt\ntroth-plight lovers.\"\n\nShe laughed and said:  \"Nay, why should I torment thee...or me?  We\nwill not tarry for this.\"  And therewith she took her arm about his\nneck and kissed him oft.\n\nThen they said naught awhile, but sat listening happily to the song of\nthe pairing birds.  At last Ralph said: \"What was it, beloved, that\nthou wert perchance to tell me concerning the thing that caused thine\nheart to see that thy betrothed, for whom thou wepst or seemedst to\nweep at the ale-house at Bourton Abbas, was of no avail to thee?\"\n\nShe said:  \"It was the sight of thee; and I thought also how I might\nnever be thine.  For that I have sorrowed many a time since.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"I am young and unmighty, yet lo!  I heal thy sorrow as if\nI were an exceeding mighty man.  And now I tell thee that I am minded\nto go back with thee to Upmeads straightway; for love will prevail.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she said, \"that word is but from the teeth outwards; for thou\nknowest, as I do, that the perils of the homeward road shall overcome\nus, despite of love, if we have not drunk of the Well at the World's\nEnd.\"\n\nAgain they were silent awhile, but anon she arose to her feet and said:\n\"Now must I needs dight victual for us twain; but first\" (and she\nsmiled on him withal), \"how is it that thou hast not asked me if the\nbeast did me any hurt?  Art thou grown careless of me, now the wedding\nis so nigh?\"\n\nHe said:  \"Nay, but could I not see thee that thou wert not hurt?\nThere was no mark of blood upon thee, nor any stain at all.\" Then she\nreddened, and said:  \"Ah, I forgot how keen-eyes thou art.\" And she\nstood silent a little while, as he looked on her and loved her\nsweetness.  Then he said:  \"I am exceeding full of joy, but my body is\nuneasy; so I will now go and skin that troll who went so nigh to slay\nthee, and break up the carcase, if thou wilt promise to abide about the\ndoor of the house, and have thy sword and the spear ready to hand, and\nto don thine helm and hauberk to boot.\"\n\nShe laughed and said:  \"That were but strange attire for a cook-maid,\nRalph, my friend; yet shall I do thy will, my lord and my love.\"\n\nThen went Ralph into the cave, and brought forth the armour and did it\non her, and kissed her, and so went his ways to the carcase of the\nbear, which lay some two furlongs from their dwelling; and when he came\nto the quarry he fell to work, and was some time about it, so huge as\nthe beast was.  Then he hung the skin and the carcase on a tree of the\ngrove, and went down to the river and washed him, and then went lightly\nhomewards.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nNow Come the Messengers of the Innocent Folk\n\n\nBut when he had come forth from the chestnut-grove, and could see the\nface of their house-rock clearly, he beheld new tidings; for there were\nfolk before the door of the dwelling, and Ursula was standing amidst of\nthem, for he could see the gleam of her armour; and with the men he\ncould see also certain beasts of burden, and anon that these were oxen.\nSo he hastened on to find what this might mean, and drew his sword as\nhe went.  But when he came up to the rock, he found there two young men\nand an elder, and they had with them five oxen, three for riding, and\ntwo sumpter beasts, laden:  and Ursula and these men were talking\ntogether friendly; so that Ralph deemed that the new-comers must be the\nmessengers of the Innocent Folk.  They were goodly men all three,\nsomewhat brown of skin, but well fashioned, and of smiling cheerful\ncountenance, well knit, and tall.  The elder had a long white beard,\nbut his eye was bright, and his hand firm and smooth.  They were all\nclad in white woollen raiment, and bore no armour, but each had an axe\nwith a green stone blade, curiously tied to the heft, and each of the\nyoung men carried a strong bow and a quiver of arrows.\n\nRalph greeted the men, and bade them sit down on the toft and eat a\nmorsel; they took his greeting kindly, and sat down, while Ursula went\ninto the cave to fetch them matters for their victual, and there was\nalready venison roasting at the fire on the toft, in the place where\nthey were wont to cook their meat.  So then came Ursula forth from the\ncave, and served the new-comers and Ralph of such things as she had,\nand they ate and drank together; and none said aught of their errand\ntill they had done their meat, but they talked together pleasantly\nabout the spring, and the blossoms of the plain and the mountain, and\nthe wild things that dwelt thereabout.\n\nBut when the meal was over, the new-comers rose to their feet, and\nbowed before Ralph and Ursula, and the elder took up the word and said:\n\"Ye fair people, have ye any errand in the wilderness, or are ye\nchance-comers who have strayed thus far, and know not how to return?\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Ralph, \"we have come a long way on an errand of life or\ndeath; for we seek the WELL at the WORLD'S END.  And see ye the token\nthereof, the pair of beads which we bear, either of us, and the fashion\nwhereof ye know.\"\n\nThen the elder bowed to them again, and said:  \"It is well; then is\nthis our errand with you, to be your way-leaders as far as the House of\nthe Sorceress, where ye shall have other help.  Will ye set out on the\njourney to-day? In one hour shall we be ready.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"we will not depart till tomorrow morn, if it may be\nso.  Therewith I bid you sit down and rest you, while ye hearken a word\nwhich I have to say to you.\"\n\nSo they sat down again, and Ralph arose and took Ursula by the hand,\nand stood with her before the elder, and said: \"This maiden, who is my\nfellow-farer in the Quest, I desire to wed this same night, and she\nalso desireth me: therefore I would have you as witnesses hereto.  But\nfirst ye shall tell us if our wedding and the knowing each other\ncarnally shall be to our hurt in the Quest; for if that be so, then\nshall we bridle our desires and perform our Quest in their despite.\"\n\nThe old man smiled upon them kindly, and said:  \"Nay, son, we hear not\nthat it shall be the worse for you in any wise that ye shall become one\nflesh; and right joyful it is to us, not only that we have found folk\nwho seek to the Well at the World's End, but also that there is such\nlove as I perceive there is betwixt such goodly and holy folk as ye be.\nFor hither we come year by year according to the behest that we made to\nthe fairest woman of the world, when she came back to us from the Well\nat the World's End, and it is many and many a year ago since we found\nany seekers after the Well dwelling here.  Therefore have we the more\njoy in you.  And we have brought hither matters good for you, as\nraiment, and meal, and wine, on our sumpter-beasts; therefore as ye\nhave feasted us this morning, so shall we feast you this even.  And if\nye will, we shall build for you in the grove yonder such a bower as we\nbuild for our own folk on the night of the wedding.\"\n\nRalph yeasaid this, and thanked them.  So then the elder cried: \"Up, my\nsons, and show your deftness to these dear friends!\" Then the young men\narose, naught loth, and when they had hoppled their oxen and taken the\nburdens from off them, they all went down the meadow together into the\nchestnut grove, and they fell to and cut willow boughs, and such-like\nwood, and drave stakes and wove the twigs together; and Ralph and\nUrsula worked with them as they bade, and they were all very merry\ntogether: because for those two wanderers it was a great delight to see\nthe faces of the children of men once more after so many months, and to\nhold converse with them; while for their part the young men marvelled\nat Ursula's beauty, and the pith and goodliness of Ralph.\n\nBy then it was nigh evening they had made a very goodly wattled bower,\nand roofed it with the skins that were in the cave, and hung it about\nwith garlands, and strewn flowers on the floor thereof.  And when all\nwas done they went back to the toft before the rock-chamber, where the\nelder had opened the loads, and had taken meal thence, and was making\ncakes at the fire.  And there was wine there in well-hooped kegs, and\nwooden cups fairly carven, and raiment of fine white wool for those\ntwain, broidered in strange but beauteous fashion with the feathers of\nbright-hued birds.\n\nSo then were those twain arrayed for the bridal; and the meat was dight\nand the cups filled, and they sat down on the grassy toft a little\nbefore sunset, and feasted till the night was come, and was grown all\nlight with the moon; and then Ralph rose up, and took Ursula's hand,\nand they stood before the elder, and bade him and the young men bear\nwitness that they were wedded: then those twain kissed the newcomers\nand departed to their bridal bower hand in hand through the freshness\nof the night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nThey Come to the Land of the Innocent Folk\n\n\nWhen it was morning they speedily gat them ready for the road, whereas\nthey had little to take with them; so they departed joyously, howbeit\nboth Ralph and Ursula felt rather love than loathing for their winter\nabode.  The day was yet young when they went their ways.  Their horses\nand all their gear were a great wonder to the young men, for they had\nseen no such beasts before:  but the elder said that once in his young\ndays he had led a man to the Well who was riding a horse and was clad\nin knightly array.\n\nSo they went by ways which were nowise dreadful, though they were void\nof men-folk, and in three days' time they were come out of the\nmountains, and in three more the said mountains were to behold but a\ncloud behind them, and the land was grown goodly, with fair valleys and\nlittle hills, though still they saw no men, and forsooth they went\nleisurely, for oxen are but slow-going nags.  But when they were gone\neight days from the Valley of Sweet-chestnuts, they came across a flock\nof uncouth-looking sheep on a green hill-side, and four folk\nshepherding them, two carles to wit, and two queans, like to their\nway-leaders, but scarce so goodly, and ruder of raiment.  These men\ngreeted them kindly, and yet with more worship than fellowship, and\nthey marvelled exceedingly at their horses and weapons.  Thence they\npassed on, and the next day came into a wide valley, well-grassed and\nwatered, and wooded here and there; moreover there were cots scattered\nabout it.  There and thenceforth they met men a many, both carles and\nqueans, and sheep and neat in plenty, and they passed by garths wherein\nthe young corn was waxing, and vineyards on the hillsides, where the\nvines were beginning to grow green.  The land seemed as goodly as might\nbe, and all the folk they met were kind, if somewhat over reverent.\n\nOn the evening of that day they came into the town of that folk, which\nwas but simple, wholly unfenced for war, and the houses but low, and\nnot great.  Yet was there naught of filth or famine, nor any poverty or\nmisery; and the people were merry-faced and well-liking, and clad\ngoodly after their fashion in white woollen cloth or frieze.  All the\npeople of the town were come forth to meet them, for runners had gone\nbefore them, and they stood on either side of the way murmuring\ngreetings, and with their heads bent low in reverence.\n\nThus rode Ralph and Ursula up to the door of the Temple, or Mote-house,\nor Guest-house, for it was all these, a house great, and as fair as\nthey knew how to make it.  Before the door thereof were standing the\nelders of the Folk; and when they drew rein, the eldest and most\nreverend of these came forth and spake in a cheerful voice, yet\nsolemnly: \"Welcome and thrice welcome to the Seekers after length of\ndays and happy times, and the loving-kindness of the Folks of the\nEarth!\"\n\nThen all the elders gathered about them, and bade them light down and\nbe at rest amongst them, and they made much of them and brought them\ninto the Mote-house, where-in were both women and men fair and stately,\nand the men took Ralph by the hand and the women Ursula, and brought\nthem into chambers where they bathed them and did off their wayfaring\nraiment, and clad them in white woollen gowns of web exceeding fine,\nand fragrant withal.  Then they crowned them with flowers, and led them\nback into the hall, whereas now was much folk gathered, and they set\nthem down on a dais as though they had been kings, or rather gods; and\nwhen they beheld them there so fair and lovely, they cried out for joy\nof them, and bade them hail oft and oft.\n\nThere then were they feasted by that kind folk, and when meat was done\ncertain youths and maidens fell to singing songs very sweetly; and the\nwords of the songs were simple and harmless, and concerning the\nfairness of the earth and the happy loves of the creatures that dwell\ntherein.\n\nThereafter as the night aged, they were shown to a sleeping chamber,\nwhich albeit not richly decked, or plenished with precious things, was\nmost dainty clean, and sweet smelling, and strewn with flowers, so that\nthe night was sweet to them in a chamber of love.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nThey Come to the House of the Sorceress\n\n\nOn the morrow the kind people delayed them little, though they sorrowed\nfor their departure, and before noon were their old way-leaders ready\nfor them; and the old man and his two grandsons (for such they were)\nwere much honoured of the simple people for their way-leading of the\nHeavenly Folk; for so they called Ralph and Ursula.  So they gat them\nto the way in suchlike guise as before, only they had with them five\nsumpter oxen instead of two; for the old man told them that not only\nwas their way longer, but also they must needs pass through a terrible\nwaste, wherein was naught for their avail, neither man, nor beast, nor\nherb.  Even so they found it as he said; for after the first day's ride\nfrom the town they came to the edge of this same waste, and on the\nfourth day were deep in the heart of it: a desert it was, rather rocky\nand stony and sandy than mountainous, though they had hills to cross\nalso: withal there was but little water there, and that foul and\nstinking.  Long lasted this waste, and Ralph thought indeed that it had\nbeen hard to cross, had not their way-leaders been; therefore he made\nmarks and signs by the wayside, and took note of the bearings of rocks\nand mounds against the day of return.\n\nTwelve days they rode this waste, and on the thirteenth it began to\nmend somewhat, and there was a little grass, and sweet waters, and they\nsaw ahead the swelling hills of a great woodland, albeit they had to\nstruggle through marshland and low scrubby thicket for a day longer, or\never they got to the aforesaid trees, which at first were naught but\npines; but these failed in a while, and they rode a grass waste nearly\ntreeless, but somewhat well watered, where they gat them good store of\nvenison.  Thereafter they came on woods of oak and sweet-chestnut, with\nhere and there a beech-wood.\n\nLong and long they rode the woodland, but it was hard on May when they\nentered it, and it was pleasant therein, and what with one thing, what\nwith another, they had abundant livelihood there.  Yet was June at its\nfull when at last they came within sight of the House of the Sorceress,\non the hottest of a fair afternoon.  And it was even as Ralph had seen\nit pictured in the arras of the hall of the Castle of Abundance; a\nlittle house built after the fashion of houses in his own land of the\nwest; the thatch was trim, and the windows and doors were unbroken, and\nthe garth was whole, and the goats feeding therein, and the wheat was\ntall and blossoming in the little closes, where as he had looked to see\nall broken down and wild, and as to the house, a mere grass-grown heap,\nor at the most a broken gable fast crumbling away.\n\nThen waxed his heart sore with the memory of that passed time, and the\nsweetness of his short-lived love, though he refrained him all he\nmight:  yet forsooth Ursula looked on him anxiously, so much his face\nwas changed by the thoughts of his heart.\n\nBut the elder of the way-leaders saw that he was moved, and deemed that\nhe was wondering at that house so trim and orderly amidst the wildwood,\nso he said:  \"Here also do we after our behest to that marvellous and\nlovely Lady, that we suffer not this house to go to ruin: ever are some\nof our folk here, and every year about this season we send two or more\nto take the places of those who have dwelt in the House year-long: so\never is there someone to keep all things trim.  But as to strangers, I\nhave never in my life seen any Seeker of the Well herein, save once,\nand that was an old hoar man like to me, save that he was feebler in\nall wise than I be.\"\n\nNow Ralph heard him talking, yet noted his words but little; for it was\nwith him as if all the grief of heart which he had penned back for so\nlong a while swelled up within him and burst its bounds; and he turned\ntoward Ursula and their eyes met, and she looked shy and anxious on him\nand he might no longer refrain himself, but put his hands to his face\n(for they had now drawn rein at the garth-gate) and brake out a\nweeping, and wept long for the friend whose feet had worn that path so\noften, and whose heart, though she were dead, had brought them thither\nfor their thriving; and for love and sorrow of him Ursula wept also.\n\nBut the old man and his grandsons turned their heads away from his\nweeping, and got off their horses, and went up to the house-door,\nwhereby were now standing a carle and a quean of their people.  But\nRalph slowly gat off his horse and stood by Ursula who was on the\nground already, but would not touch her, for he was ashamed.  But she\nlooked on him kindly and said:  \"Dear friend, there is no need for\nshame; for though I be young, I know how grievous it is when the dead\nthat we have loved come across our ways, and we may not speak to them,\nnor they to us.  So I will but bid thee be comforted and abide in thy\nlove for the living and the dead.\" His tears brake out again at that\nword, for he was but young, and for a while there was a lull in the\nstrife that had beset his days.  But after a little he looked up, and\ndashed the tears from his eyes and smiled on Ursula and said:  \"The\ntale she told me of this place, the sweetness of it came back upon me,\nand I might not forbear.\" She said:  \"O friend, thou art kind, and I\nlove thee.\"\n\nSo then they joined hands and went through the garth together, and up\nto the door, where stood the wardens, who, when they saw them turning\nthither, came speedily down the path to them, and would have knelt in\nworship to them; but they would not suffer it, but embraced and kissed\nthem, and thanked them many times for their welcome.  The said wardens,\nboth carle and quean, were goodly folk of middle age, stalwart, and\nkind of face.\n\nSo then they went into the house together, and entered into the\nself-same chamber, where of old the Lady of Abundance had sickened for\nfear of the Sorceress sitting naked at her spell-work.\n\nGreat joy they made together, and the wardens set meat and drink before\nthe guests, and they ate and drank and were of good cheer.  But the\nelder who had brought them from Chestnut-dale said: \"Dear friends, I\nhave told you that these two young men are my grand-children, and they\nare the sons of this man and woman whom ye see; for the man is my son.\nAnd so it is, that amongst us the care of the Quest of the Well at the\nWorld's End hath for long been the heritage of our blood, going with us\nfrom father to son.  Therefore is it naught wonderful, though I have\nbeen sundry times at this house, and have learned about the place all\nthat may be learned.  For my father brought me hither when I was yet a\nboy; that time it was that I saw the last man of whom we know for sure\nthat he drank of the Water of the Well, and he was that old hoar man\nlike unto me, but, as I said, far weaker in all wise; but when he came\nback to us from the Well he was strong and stalwart, and a better man\nthan I am now; and I heard him tell his name to my father, that he was\ncalled the Sage of Swevenham.\"\n\nRalph looked on Ursula and said:  \"Yea, father, and it was through him\nthat we had our lore concerning the way hither; and it was he that bade\nus abide your coming in the rock-house of the Vale of Sweet-chestnuts.\"\n\n\"Then he is alive still,\" said the elder.  Said Ralph: \"Yea, and as\nfair and strong an old man as ye may lightly see.\" \"Yea, yea,\" said the\nelder, \"and yet fifty years ago his course seemed run.\"\n\nThen said Ralph:  \"Tell me, father, have none of your own folk sought\nto the Well at the World's End?\"  \"Nay, none,\" said the elder.  Said\nRalph:  \"That is strange, whereas ye are so nigh thereto, and have such\nabundant lore concerning the way.\"\n\n\"Son,\" said the elder, \"true it is that the water of that Well shall\ncause a man to thrive in all ways, and to live through many generations\nof men, maybe, in honour and good-liking; but it may not keep any man\nalive for ever; for so have the Gods given us the gift of death lest we\nweary of life.  Now our folk live well and hale, and without the\nsickness and pestilence, such as I have heard oft befall folk in other\nlands: even as I heard the Sage of Swevenham say, and I wondered at his\nwords.  Of strife and of war also we know naught: nor do we desire\naught which we may not easily attain to.  Therefore we live long, and\nwe fear the Gods if we should strive to live longer, lest they should\nbring upon us war and sickness, and over-weening desire, and weariness\nof life.  Moreover it is little that all of us should seek to the Well\nat the World's End; and those few that sought and drank should be\nstronger and wiser than the others, and should make themselves earthly\ngods, and, maybe, should torment the others of us and make their lives\na very burden to be borne.  Of such matters are there tales current\namongst us that so it hath been of yore and in other lands; and ill it\nwere if such times came back upon us.\"\n\nRalph hung his head and was silent; for the joy of the Quest seemed\ndying out as the old man's words dropped slowly from his mouth.  But he\nsmiled upon Ralph and went on:  \"But for you, guests, it is otherwise,\nfor ye of the World beyond the Mountains are stronger and more godlike\nthan we, as all tales tell; and ye wear away your lives desiring that\nwhich ye may scarce get; and ye set your hearts on high things,\ndesiring to be masters of the very Gods.  Therefore ye know sickness\nand sorrow, and oft ye die before your time, so that ye must depart and\nleave undone things which ye deem ye were born to do; which to all men\nis grievous.  And because of all this ye desire healing and thriving,\nwhether good come of it, or ill.  Therefore ye do but right to seek to\nthe Well at the World's End, that ye may the better accomplish that\nwhich behoveth you, and that ye may serve your fellows and deliver them\nfrom the thralldom of those that be strong and unwise and unkind, of\nwhom we have heard strange tales.\"\n\nRalph reddened as he spake, and Ursula looked on him anxiously, but\nthat talk dropped for the present, and they fell to talking of lighter\nand more familiar matters.\n\nThereafter they wandered about the woods with the wardens and the\nway-leaders, and the elder brought them to the ancient altar in the\nwood whereon the Sorceress had offered up the goat; and the howe of the\nwoman dight with the necklace of the Quest whom the Lady found dead in\nthe snow; and the place nigh the house where the Sorceress used to\ntorment her thrall that was afterwards the Lady of Abundance; yea, and\nthey went further afield till they came to the Vale of Lore, and the\nHeath above it where they met, the King's Son and the Lady.  All these\nand other places were now become as hallowed ground to the Innocent\nPeople, and to Ralph no less.  In the house, moreover, was a fair ark\nwherein they kept matters which had belonged to the Lady, as her shoes\nand her smock, wrapped in goodly cloth amidst well-smelling herbs; and\nthese things they worshipped as folk do with relics of the saints.  In\nanother ark also they showed the seekers a book wherein was written\nlore concerning the Well, and the way thereto.  But of this book had\nthe Sage forewarned Ralph and his mate, and had bidden them look to it\nthat they should read in it, and no otherwhere than at that ancient\naltar in the wood, they two alone, and clad in such-like gear as they\nwore when they hearkened to his reading by his hermitage.  And so it\nwas that they found the due raiment in the ark along with the book.\nTherefore day after day betimes in the morning they bore the said book\nto the altar and read therein, till they had learned much wisdom.\n\nThus they did for eight days, and on the ninth they rested and were\nmerry with their hosts:  but on the tenth day they mounted their horses\nand said farewell, and departed by the ways they had learned of, they\ntwo alone.  And they had with them bread and meal, as much as they\nmight bear, and water-skins moreover, that they might fill them at the\nlast sweet water before they came to the waterless desert.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nThey Come Through the Woodland to the Thirsty Desert\n\n\nSo they ride their ways, and when they were come well into the wildwood\npast the house, and had spoken but few words to each other, Ralph put\nforth his hand, and stayed Ursula, and they gat off their horses under\na great-limbed oak, and did off their armour, and sat down on the\ngreensward there, and loved each other dearly, and wept for joy of\ntheir pain and travail and love.  And afterwards, as they sat side by\nside leaning up against the great oak-bole, Ralph spake and said: \"Now\nare we two once again all alone in the uttermost parts of the earth,\nand belike we are not very far from the Well at the World's End; and\nnow I have bethought me that if we gain that which we seek for, and\nbear back our lives to our own people, the day may come when we are\ngrown old, for as young as we may seem, that we shall be as lonely then\nas we are this hour, and that the folk round about us shall be to us as\nmuch and no more than these trees and the wild things that dwell\namongst them.\"\n\nShe looked on him and laughed as one over-happy, and said: \"Thou\nrunnest forward swiftly to meet trouble, beloved!  But I say that well\nwill it be in those days if I love the folk then as well as now I love\nthese trees and the wild things whose house they are.\"\n\nAnd she rose up therewith and threw her arms about the oak-bole and\nkissed its ruggedness, while Ralph as he lay kissed the sleekness of\nher feet.  And there came a robin hopping over the leaves anigh them,\nfor in that wood most of the creatures, knowing not man, were tame to\nhim, and feared the horses of those twain more than their riders.  And\nnow as Ursula knelt to embrace Ralph with one hand, she held out the\nother to the said robin who perched on her wrist, and sat there as a\nhooded falcon had done, and fell to whistling his sweet notes, as if he\nwere a-talking to those new-comers: then Ursula gave him a song-reward\nof their broken meat, and he flew up and perched on her shoulder, and\nnestled up against her cheek, and she laughed happily and said: \"Lo\nyou, sweet, have not the wild things understood my words, and sent this\nfair messenger to foretell us all good?\"\n\n\"It is good,\" said Ralph laughing, \"yet the oak-tree hath not spoken\nyet, despite of all thy kissing:  and lo there goes thy friend the\nrobin, now thou hast no more meat to give him.\"\n\n\"He is flying towards the Well at the World's End,\" she said, \"and\nbiddeth us onward:  let us to horse and hasten: for if thou wilt have\nthe whole truth concerning my heart, it is this, that some chance-hap\nmay yet take thee from me ere thou hast drunk of the waters of the\nWell.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and in the innermost of my heart lieth the fear\nthat mayhappen there is no Well, and no healing in it if we find it,\nand that death, and the backward way may yet sunder us.  This is the\nworst of my heart, and evil is my coward fear.\"\n\nBut she cast her arms about him and kissed and caressed him, and cried\nout: \"Yea, then fair have been the days of our journeying, and fair\nthis hour of the green oak!  And bold and true thine heart that hath\nled thee thus far, and won thee thy desire of my love.\"\n\nSo then they armed them, and mounted their horses and set forward.\nThey lived well while they were in the wood, but on the third day they\ncame to where it thinned and at last died out into a stony waste like\nunto that which they had passed through before they came to the House\nof the Sorceress, save that this lay in ridges as the waves of a great\nsea; and these same ridges they were bidden to cross over at their\nhighest, lest they should be bewildered in a maze of little hills and\ndales leading no whither.\n\nSo they entered on this desert, having filled their water-skins at a\nclear brook, whereat they rejoiced when they found that the face of the\nwilderness was covered with a salt scurf, and that naught grew there\nsave a sprinkling of small sage bushes.\n\nNow on the second day of their riding this ugly waste, as they came up\nover the brow of one of these stony ridges, Ralph the far-sighted cried\nout suddenly:  \"Hold! for I see a man weaponed.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" quoth Ursula, \"and what is he about?\" Said Ralph:  \"He\nis up yonder on the swell of the next ridge, and by seeming is asleep\nleaning against a rock.\"\n\nThen he bent the Turk bow and set an arrow on the string and they went\non warily.  When they were down at the foot of the ridge Ralph hailed\nthe man with a lusty cry, but gat no answer of him; so they went on up\nthe bent, till Ralph said:  \"Now I can see his face under his helm, and\nit is dark and the eyes are hollow: I will off horse and go up to him\nafoot, but do thou, beloved, sit still in thy saddle.\"\n\nBut when he had come nigher, he turned and cried out to her: \"The man\nis dead, come anigh.\"  So she went up to him and dismounted, and they\nboth together stood over the man, who was lying up against a big stone\nlike one at rest.  How long he had lain there none knows but God; for\nin the saltness of the dry desert the flesh had dried on his bones\nwithout corrupting, and was as hardened leather.  He was in full armour\nof a strange and ancient fashion, and his sword was girt to his side,\nneither was there any sign of a wound about him.  Under a crag anigh\nhim they found his horse, dead and dry like to himself; and a little\nway over the brow of the ridge another horse in like case; and close by\nhim a woman whose raiment had not utterly perished, nor her hair; there\nwere gold rings on her arms, and her shoes were done with gold: she had\na knife stuck in her breast, with her hand still clutching the handle\nthereof; so that it seemed that she had herself given herself death.\n\nRalph and Ursula buried these two with the heaping of stones and went\ntheir ways; but some two miles thence they came upon another dead\nman-at-arms, and near him an old man unweaponed, and they heaped stones\non them.\n\nThereabout night overtook them, and it was dark, so they lay down in\nthe waste, and comforted each other, and slept two or three hours, but\narose with the first glimmer of dawn, and mounted and rode forth\nonward, that they might the sooner be out of that deadly desert, for\nfear clung to their hearts.\n\nThis day, forsooth, they found so many dead folk, that they might not\nstay to bury them, lest they themselves should come to lie there\nlacking burial.  So they made all the way they might, and rode on some\nhours by starlight after the night was come, for it was clear and cold.\nSo that at last they were so utterly wearied that they lay down amongst\nthose dead folk, and slept soundly.\n\nOn the morrow morn Ralph awoke and saw Ursula sleeping peacefully as he\ndeemed, and he looked about on the dreary desert and its dead men and\nsaw no end to it, though they lay on the top of one of those stony\nbents; and he said softly to himself:  \"Will it end at all then?\nSurely all this people of the days gone by were Seekers of the Well as\nwe be; and have they belike turned back from somewhere further on, and\nmight not escape the desert despite of all?  Shall we turn now: shall\nwe turn? surely we might get into the kindly wood from here.\"\n\nSo he spake; but Ursula sat up (for she was not asleep) and said: \"The\nperils of the waste being abundant and exceeding hard to face, would\nnot the Sage or his books have told us of the most deadly?\" Said Ralph:\n\"Yet here are all these dead, and we were not told of them,\nnevertheless we have seen the token on the rocks oft-times yesterday,\nso we are yet in the road, unless all this hath been but a snare and a\nbetrayal.\"\n\nShe shook her head, and was silent a little; then she said: \"Ralph, my\nlad, didst thou see this token (and she set hand to the beads about her\nneck) on any of those dead folk yesterday?\" \"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"though\nsooth to say I looked for it.\" \"And I in likewise,\" she said; \"for\nindeed I had misgivings as the day grew old; but now I say, let us on\nin the faith of that token and the kindness of the Sage, and the love\nof the Innocent People; yea, and thy luck, O lad of the green fields\nfar away, that hath brought thee unscathed so far from Upmeads.\"\n\nSo they mounted and rode forth, and saw more and more of the dead folk;\nand ever and anon they looked to them to note if they wore the beads\nlike to them but saw none so dight.  Then Ursula said: \"Yea, why should\nthe Sage and the books have told us aught of these dead bodies, that\nare but as the plenishing of the waste; like to the flowers that are\ncast down before the bier of a saint on a holy-day to be trodden under\nfoot by the churls and the vicars of the close.  Forsooth had they been\nalive now, with swords to smite withal, and hands to drag us into\ncaptivity, it had been another matter: but against these I feel bold.\"\n\nRalph sighed, and said:  \"Yea, but even if we die not in the waste, yet\nthis is piteous; so many lives passed away, so many hopes slain.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said; \"but do not folk die there in the world behind us?  I\nhave seen sights far worser than this at Utterbol, little while as I\nwas there.  Moreover I can note that this army of dead men has not come\nall in one day or one year, but in a long, long while, by one and two\nand three; for hast thou not noted that their raiment and wargear both,\nis of many fashions, and some much more perished than other, long as\nthings last in this Dry Waste?  I say that men die as in the world\nbeyond, but here we see them as they lie dead, and have lain for so\nlong.\"\n\nHe said:  \"I fear neither the Waste nor the dead men if thou fearest\nnot, beloved:  but I lament for these poor souls.\"\n\n\"And I also,\" said she; \"therefore let us on, that we may come to those\nwhose grief we may heal.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nThey Come to the Dry Tree\n\n\nPresently as they rode they had before them one of the greatest of\nthose land-waves, and they climbed it slowly, going afoot and leading\ntheir horses; but when they were but a little way from the brow they\nsaw, over a gap thereof, something, as it were huge horns rising up\ninto the air beyond the crest of the ridge.  So they marvelled, and\ndrew their swords, and held them still awhile, misdoubting if this were\nperchance some terrible monster of the waste; but whereas the thing\nmoved not at all, they plucked up heart and fared on.\n\nSo came they to the brow and looked over it into a valley, about which\non all sides went the ridge, save where it was broken down into a\nnarrow pass on the further side, so that the said valley was like to\none of those theatres of the ancient Roman Folk, whereof are some to be\nseen in certain lands.  Neither did those desert benches lack their\nsitters; for all down the sides of the valley sat or lay children of\nmen; some women, but most men-folk, of whom the more part were\nweaponed, and some with their drawn swords in their hands.  Whatever\nsemblance of moving was in them was when the eddying wind of the valley\nstirred the rags of their raiment, or the long hair of the women.  But\na very midmost of this dreary theatre rose up a huge and monstrous\ntree, whose topmost branches were even the horns which they had seen\nfrom below the hill's brow.  Leafless was that tree and lacking of\ntwigs, and its bole upheld but some fifty of great limbs, and as they\nlooked on it, they doubted whether it were not made by men's hands\nrather than grown up out of the earth.  All round about the roots of it\nwas a pool of clear water, that cast back the image of the valley-side\nand the bright sky of the desert, as though it had been a mirror of\nburnished steel.  The limbs of that tree were all behung with blazoned\nshields and knight's helms, and swords, and spears, and axes, and\nhawberks; and it rose up into the air some hundred feet above the flat\nof the valley.\n\nFor a while they looked down silently on to this marvel then from both\ntheir lips at once came the cry THE DRY TREE.  Then Ralph thrust his\nsword back into his sheath and said: \"Meseems I must needs go down\namongst them; there is naught to do us harm here; for all these are\ndead like the others that we saw.\"\n\nUrsula turned to him with burning cheeks and sparkling eyes, and said\neagerly:  \"Yea, yea, let us go down, else might we chance to miss\nsomething that we ought to wot of.\"\n\nTherewith she also sheathed her sword, and they went both of them down\ntogether, and that easily; for as aforesaid the slope was as if it had\nbeen cut into steps for their feet.  And as they passed by the dead\nfolk, for whom they had often to turn aside, they noted that each of\nthe dead leathery faces was drawn up in a grin as though they had died\nin pain, and yet beguiled, so that all those visages looked somewhat\nalike, as though they had come from the workshop of one craftsman.\n\nAt last Ralph and Ursula stood on the level ground underneath the Tree,\nand they looked up at the branches, and down to the water at their\nfeet; and now it seemed to them as though the Tree had verily growth in\nit, for they beheld its roots, that they went out from the mound or\nislet of earth into the water, and spread abroad therein, and seemed to\nwaver about.  So they walked around the Tree, and looked up at the\nshields that hung on its branches, but saw no blazon that they knew,\nthough they were many and diverse; and the armour also and weapons were\nvery diverse of fashion.\n\nNow when they were come back again to the place where they had first\nstayed, Ralph said:  \"I thirst, and so belike dost thou; and here is\nwater good and clear; let us drink then, and so spare our water-skins,\nfor belike the dry desert is yet long.\"  And therewith he knelt down\nthat he might take of the water in the hollow of his hand.  But Ursula\ndrew him back, and cried out in terror:  \"O Ralph, do it not!  Seest\nthou not this water, that although it be bright and clear, so that we\nmay see all the pebbles at the bottom, yet nevertheless when the wind\neddies about, and lifts the skirts of our raiment, it makes no ripple\non the face of the pool, and doubtless it is heavy with venom; and\nmoreover there is no sign of the way hereabout, as at other\nwatering-steads; O forbear, Ralph!\"\n\nThen he rose up and drew back with her but slowly and unwillingly as\nshe deemed; and they stood together a while gazing on these marvels.\nBut lo amidst of this while, there came a crow wheeling over the valley\nof the dead, and he croaked over the Dry Tree, and let himself drop\ndown to the edge of the pool, whereby he stalked about a little after\nthe manner of his kind.  Then he thrust his neb into the water and\ndrank, and thereafter took wing again; but ere he was many feet off the\nground he gave a grievous croak, and turning over in the air fell down\nstark dead close to the feet of those twain; and Ralph cried out but\nspake no word with meaning therein; then said Ursula:  \"Yea, thus are\nwe saved from present death.\" Then she looked in Ralph's face, and\nturned pale and said hastily: \"O my friend how is it with thee?\"  But\nshe waited not for an answer, but turned her face to the bent whereby\nthey had come down, and cried out in a loud, shrill voice:  \"O Ralph,\nRalph! look up yonder to the ridge whereby we left our horses; look,\nlook! there glitters a spear and stirreth! and lo a helm underneath the\nspear: tarry not, let us save our horses!\"\n\nThen Ralph let a cry out from his mouth, and set off running to the\nside of the slope, and fell to climbing it with great strides, not\nheeding Ursula; but she followed close after, and scrambled up with\nfoot and hand and knee, till she stood beside him on the top, and he\nlooked around wildly and cried out: \"Where! where are they?\"\n\n\"Nowhere,\" she said, \"it was naught but my word to draw thee from\ndeath; but praise to the saints that thou are come alive out of the\naccursed valley.\"\n\nHe seemed not to hearken, but turned about once, and beat the air with\nhis hands, and then fell down on his back and with a great wail she\ncast herself upon him, for she deemed at first that he was dead.  But\nshe took a little water from one of their skins, and cast it into his\nface, and took a flask of cordial from her pouch, and set it to his\nlips, and made him drink somewhat thereof.  So in a while he came to\nhimself and opened his eyes and smiled upon her, and she took his head\nin her hands and kissed his cheek, and he sat up and said feebly:\n\"Shall we not go down into the valley?  there is naught there to harm\nus.\"\n\n\"We have been down there already,\" she said, \"and well it is that we\nare not both lying there now.\"\n\nThen he got to his feet, and stretched himself, and yawned like one\njust awakened from long sleep.  But she said: \"Let us to horse and\nbegone; it is early hours to slumber, for those that are seeking the\nWell at the World's End.\"\n\nHe smiled on her again and took her hand, and she led him to his horse,\nand helped him till he was in the saddle and lightly she gat\na-horseback, and they rode away swiftly from that evil place; and after\na while Ralph was himself again, and remembered all that had happened\ntill he fell down on the brow of the ridge.  Then he praised Ursula's\nwisdom and valiancy till she bade him forbear lest he weary her.\nAlbeit she drew up close to him and kissed his face sweetly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nThey Come Out of the Thirsty Desert\n\n\nPast the Valley of the Dry Tree they saw but few dead men lying about,\nand soon they saw never another: and, though the land was still utterly\nbarren, and all cast up into ridges as before, yet the salt slime grew\nless and less, and before nightfall of that day they had done with it:\nand the next day those stony waves were lower; and the next again the\nwaste was but a swelling plain, and here and there they came on patches\nof dwarf willow, and other harsh and scanty herbage, whereof the horses\nmight have a bait, which they sore needed, for now was their fodder\ndone: but both men and horses were sore athirst; for, as carefully as\nthey had hoarded their water, there was now but little left, which they\ndurst not drink till they were driven perforce, lest they should yet\ndie of drought.\n\nThey journeyed long that day, and whereas the moon was up at night-tide\nthey lay not down till she was set; and their resting place was by some\nlow bushes, whereabout was rough grass mingled with willow-herb,\nwhereby Ralph judged that they drew nigh to water, so or ever they\nslept, they and the horses all but emptied the water-skins. They heard\nsome sort of beasts roaring in the night, but they were too weary to\nwatch, and might not make a fire.\n\nWhen Ralph awoke in the morning he cried out that he could see the\nwoodland; and Ursula arose at his cry and looked where he pointed, and\nsure enough there were trees on a rising ground some two miles ahead,\nand beyond them, not very far by seeming, they beheld the tops of great\ndark mountains.  On either hand moreover, nigh on their right hand, far\noff on their left, ran a reef of rocks, so that their way seemed to be\nas between two walls.  And these said reefs were nowise like those that\nthey had seen of late, but black and, as to their matter, like to the\ngreat mountains by the rock of the Fighting Man:  but as the reefs ran\neastward they seemed to grow higher.\n\nNow they mounted their horses at once and rode on; and the beasts were\nas eager as they were, and belike smelt the water.  So when they had\nridden but three miles, they saw a fair little river before them\nwinding about exceedingly, but flowing eastward on the whole.  So they\nspurred on with light hearts and presently were on the banks of the\nsaid river, and its waters were crystal-clear, though its sands were\nblack: and the pink-blossomed willow-herb was growing abundantly on the\nsandy shores.  Close to the water was a black rock, as big as a man,\nwhereon was graven the sign of the way, so they knew that there was no\nevil in the water, wherefore they drank their fill and watered their\nhorses abundantly, and on the further bank was there abundance of good\ngrass.  So when they had drunk their fill, for the pleasure of the cool\nwater they waded the ford barefoot, and it was scarce above Ursula's\nknee.  Then they had great joy to lie on the soft grass and eat their\nmeat, while the horses tore eagerly at the herbage close to them.  So\nwhen they had eaten, they rested awhile, but before they went further\nthey despoiled them, one after other, and bathed in a pool of the river\nto wash the foul wilderness off them.  Then again they rested and let\nthe horses yet bite the grass, and departed not from that pleasant\nplace till it was two hours after noon.  As they were lying there Ralph\nsaid he could hear a great roar like the sound of many waters, but very\nfar off: but to Ursula it seemed naught but the wind waxing in the\nboughs of the woodland anigh them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nThey Come to the Ocean Sea\n\n\nBeing come to the wood they went not very far into it that day, for\nthey were minded to rest them after the weariness of the wilderness:\nthey feasted on a hare which Ralph shot, and made a big fire to keep\noff evil beasts, but none came nigh them, though they heard the voices\nof certain beasts as the night grew still.  To be short, they slept far\ninto the morrow's morn, and then, being refreshed, and their horses\nalso, they rode strongly all day, and found the wood to be not very\ngreat; for before sunset they were come to its outskirts, and the\nmountains lay before them.  These were but little like to that huge\nwall they had passed through on their way to Chestnut-dale, being\nrather great hills than mountains, grass-grown, and at their feet\nsomewhat wooded, and by seeming not over hard to pass over.\n\nThe next day they entered them by a pass marked with the token, which\nled them about by a winding way till they were on the side of the\nbiggest fell of all; so there they rested that night in a fair little\nhollow or dell in the mountain-side. There in the stillness of the\nnight both Ursula, as well as Ralph, heard that roaring of a great\nwater, and they said to each other that it must be the voice of the\nSea, and they rejoiced thereat, for they had learned by the Sage and\nhis books that they must needs come to the verge of the Ocean-Sea,\nwhich girdles the earth about.  So they arose betimes on the morrow,\nand set to work to climb the mountain, going mostly a-foot; and the way\nwas long, but not craggy or exceeding steep, so that in five hours'\ntime they were at the mountain-top, and coming over the brow beheld\nbeneath them fair green slopes besprinkled with trees, and beyond them,\nsome three or four miles away, the blue landless sea and on either hand\nof them was the sea also, so that they were nigh-hand at the ending of\na great ness, and there was naught beyond it; and naught to do if they\nmissed the Well, but to turn back by the way they had come.\n\nNow when they saw this they were exceedingly moved and they looked on\none another, and each saw that the other was pale, with glistening\neyes, since they were to come to the very point of their doom, and that\nit should be seen whether there were no such thing as the Well in all\nthe earth, but that they had been chasing a fair-hued cloud; or else\ntheir Quest should be achieved and they should have the world before\nthem, and they happy and mighty, and of great worship amidst all men.\n\nLittle they tarried, but gat them down the steep of the mountain, and\nso lower and lower till they were come to ground nigh level; and then\nat last it was but thus, that without any great rock-wall or girdle of\nmarvellous and strange land, there was an end of earth, with its grass\nand trees and streams, and a beginning of the ocean, which stretched\naway changeless, and it might be for ever.  Where the land ended there\nwas but a cliff of less than an hundred feet above the eddying of the\nsea; and on the very point of the ness was a low green toft with a\nsquare stone set atop of it, whereon as they drew nigh they saw the\ntoken graven, yea on each face thereof.\n\nThen they went along the edge of the cliff a mile on each side of the\nsaid toft, and then finding naught else to note, naught save the grass\nand the sea, they came back to that place of the token, and sat down on\nthe grass of the toft.\n\nIt was now evening, and the sun was setting beyond them, but they could\nbehold a kind of stair cut in the side of the cliff, and on the first\nstep whereof was the token done; wherefore they knew that they were\nbidden to go down by the said stair; but it seemed to lead no whither,\nsave straight into the sea.  And whiles it came into Ralph's mind that\nthis was naught but a mock, as if to bid the hapless seekers cast\nthemselves down from the earth, and be done with it for ever.  But in\nany case they might not try the adventure of that stair by the failing\nlight, and with the night long before them.  So when they had hoppled\ntheir horses, and left them to graze at their will on the sweet grass\nof the meadow, they laid them down behind the green toft, and, being\nforwearied, it was no long time ere they twain slept fast at the\nuttermost end of the world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nNow They Drink of the Well at the World's End\n\n\nRalph awoke from some foolish morning dream of Upmeads, wondering where\nhe was, or what familiar voice had cried out his name:  then he raised\nhimself on his elbow, and saw Ursula standing before him with flushed\nface and sparkling eyes, and she was looking out seaward, while she\ncalled on his name.  So he sprang up and strove with the slumber that\nstill hung about him, and as his eyes cleared he looked down, and saw\nthat the sea, which last night had washed the face of the cliff, had\nnow ebbed far out, and left bare betwixt the billows and the cliff some\nhalf mile of black sand, with rocks of the like hue rising out of it\nhere and there.  But just below the place where they stood, right up\nagainst the cliff, was builded by man's hand of huge stones a garth of\npound, the wall whereof was some seven feet high, and the pound within\nthe wall of forty feet space endlong and overthwart; and the said pound\nwas filled with the waters of a spring that came forth from the face of\nthe cliff as they deemed, though from above they might not see the\nissue thereof; but the water ran seaward from the pound by some way\nunseen, and made a wide stream through the black sand of the foreshore:\nbut ever the great basin filled somewhat faster than it voided, so that\nit ran over the lip on all sides, making a thin veil over the huge\nashlar-stones of the garth.  The day was bright and fair with no wind,\nsave light airs playing about from the westward ort, and all things\ngleamed and glittered in the sun.\n\nRalph stood still a moment, and then stretched abroad his arms, and\nwith a great sob cast them round about the body of his beloved, and\nstrained her to his bosom as he murmured about her, THE WELL AT THE\nWORLD'S END.  But she wept for joy as she fawned upon him, and let her\nhands beat upon his body.\n\nBut when they were somewhat calmed of their ecstasy of joy, they made\nready to go down by that rocky stair.  And first they did off their\narmour and other gear, and when they were naked they did on the\nhallowed raiment which they had out of the ark in the House of the\nSorceress; and so clad gat them down the rock-hewn stair, Ralph going\nfirst, lest there should be any broken place; but naught was amiss with\nthose hard black stones, and they came safely to a level place of the\nrock, whence they could see the face of the cliff, and how the waters\nof the Well came gushing forth from a hollow therein in a great\nswelling wave as clear as glass; and the sun glistened in it and made a\nfoam-bow about its edges.  But above the issue of the waters the black\nrock had been smoothed by man's art, and thereon was graven the Sword\nand the Bough, and above it these words, to wit:\n\nYE WHO HAVE COME A LONG WAY TO LOOK UPON ME, DRINK OF ME, IF YE DEEM\nTHAT YE BE STRONG ENOUGH IN DESIRE TO BEAR LENGTH OF DAYS: OR ELSE\nDRINK NOT; BUT TELL YOUR FRIENDS AND THE KINDREDS OF THE EARTH HOW YE\nHAVE SEEN A GREAT MARVEL.\n\nSo they looked long and wondered; and Ursula said:  \"Deemest thou, my\nfriend, that any have come thus far and forborne to drink?\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Surely not even the exceeding wise might remember the\nbitterness of his wisdom as he stood here.\"\n\nThen he looked on her and his face grew bright beyond measure, and\ncried out: \"O love, love! why tarry we?  For yet I fear lest we be come\ntoo late, and thou die before mine eyes ere yet thou hast drunken.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"and I also fear for thee, though thy face is ruddy\nand thine eyes sparkle, and thou art as lovely as the Captain of the\nLord's hosts.\"\n\nThen she laughed, and her laughter was as silver bells rung tunably,\nand she said:  \"But where is the cup for the drinking?\"\n\nBut Ralph looked on the face of the wall, and about the height of his\nhand saw square marks thereon, as though there were an ambrye; and\namidst the square was a knop of latten, all green with the weather and\nthe salt spray.  So Ralph set his hand to the knop and drew strongly,\nand lo it was a door made of a squared stone hung on brazen hinges, and\nit opened easily to him, and within was a cup of goldsmith's work, with\nthe sword and the bough done thereon; and round about the rim writ this\nposey: \"THE STRONG OF HEART SHALL DRINK FROM ME.\"  So Ralph took it and\nheld it aloft so that its pure metal flashed in the sun, and he said:\n\"This is for thee, Sweetling.\"\n\n\"Yea, and for thee,\" she said.\n\nNow that level place, or bench-table went up to the very gushing and\ngreen bow of the water, so Ralph took Ursula's hand and led her along,\nshe going a little after him, till he was close to the Well, and stood\namidst the spray-bow thereof, so that he looked verily like one of the\npainted angels on the choir wall of St. Laurence of Upmeads.  Then he\nreached forth his hand and thrust the cup into the water, holding it\nstoutly because the gush of the stream was strong, so that the water of\nthe Well splashed all over him, wetting Ursula's face and breast\nwithal: and he felt that the water was sweet without any saltness of\nthe sea.  But he turned to Ursula and reached out the full cup to her,\nand said: \"Sweetling, call a health over the cup!\"\n\nShe took it and said:  \"To thy life, beloved!\" and drank withal, and\nher eyes looked out of the cup the while, like a child's when he\ndrinketh.  Then she gave him the cup again and said: \"Drink, and tarry\nnot, lest thou die and I live.\"\n\nThen Ralph plunged the cup into the waters again, and he held the cup\naloft, and cried out:  \"To the Earth, and the World of Manfolk!\" and\ntherewith he drank.\n\nFor a minute then they clung together within the spray-bow of the Well,\nand then she took his hand and led him back to the midst of the\nbench-table, and he put the cup into the ambrye, and shut it up again,\nand then they sat them down on the widest of the platform under the\nshadow of a jutting rock; for the sun was hot; and therewithal a sweet\nweariness began to steal over them, though there was speech betwixt\nthem for a little, and Ralph said: \"How is it with thee, beloved?\"\n\n\"O well indeed,\" she said.\n\nQuoth he:  \"And how tasteth to thee the water of the Well?\"\n\nSlowly she spake and sleepily:  \"It tasted good, and as if thy love\nwere blended with it.\"\n\nAnd she smiled in his face; but he said:  \"One thing I wonder over: how\nshall we wot if we have drunk aright?  For whereas if we were sick or\nold and failing, or ill-liking, and were now presently healed of all\nthis, and become strong and fair to look on, then should we know it for\nsure--but now, though, as I look on thee, I behold thee the fairest of\nall women, and on thy face is no token of toil and travail, and the\nweariness of the way; and though the heart-ache of loneliness and\ncaptivity, and the shame of Utterbol has left no mark upon thee--yet\nhast thou not always been sweet to my eyes, and as sweet as might be?\nAnd how then?\"...But he broke off and looked on her and she smiled upon\nthe love in his eyes, and his head fell back and he slept with a calm\nand smiling face.  And she leaned over him to kiss his face but even\ntherewith her own eyes closed and she laid her head upon his breast,\nand slept as peacefully as he.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nNow They Have Drunk and Are Glad\n\n\nLong they slept till the shadows were falling from the west, and the\nsea was flowing fast again over the sands beneath them, though there\nwas still a great space bare betwixt the cliff and the sea.  Then spake\nUrsula as if Ralph had but just left speaking; and she said: \"Yea, dear\nlord, and I also say, that, lovely as thou art now, never hast thou\nbeen aught else but lovely to me.  But tell me, hast thou had any scar\nof a hurt upon thy body?  For if now that were gone, surely it should\nbe a token of the renewal of thy life.  But if it be not gone, then\nthere may yet be another token.\"\n\nThen he stood upon his feet, and she cried out: \"O but thou art fair\nand mighty, who now shall dare gainsay thee?  Who shall not long for\nthee?\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Look, love! how the sea comes over the sand like the\ncreeping of a sly wood-snake! Shall we go hence and turn from the\nocean-sea without wetting our bodies in its waters?\"\n\n\"Let us go,\" she said.\n\nSo they went down on to the level sands, and along the edges of the\nsweet-water stream that flowed from the Well; and Ralph said: \"Beloved,\nI will tell thee of that which thou hast asked me: when I was but a lad\nof sixteen winters there rode men a-lifting into Upmeads, and Nicholas\nLongshanks, who is a wise man of war, gathered force and went against\nthem, and I must needs ride beside him.  Now we came to our above, and\nput the thieves to the road; but in the hurly I got a claw from the\nwar-beast, for the stroke of a sword sheared me off somewhat from my\nshoulder: belike thou hast seen the scar and loathed it.\"\n\n\"It is naught loathsome,\" she said, \"for a lad to be a bold warrior,\nnor for a grown man to think lightly of the memory of death drawn near\nfor the first time.  Yea, I have noted it but let me see now what has\nbefallen with it.\"\n\nAs she spoke they were come to a salt pool in a rocky bight on their\nright hand, which the tide was filling speedily; and Ralph spake: \"See\nnow, this is the bath of the water of the ocean sea.\" So they were\nspeedily naked and playing in the water: and Ursula took Ralph by the\narm and looked to his shoulder and said: \"O my lad of the pale edges,\nwhere is gone thy glory?  There is no mark of the sword's pilgrimage on\nthy shoulder.\" \"Nay, none?\" quoth he.\n\n\"None, none!\" she said, \"Didst thou say the very sooth of thy hurt in\nthe battle, O poor lad of mine?\"  \"Yea, the sooth,\" said he.  Then she\nlaughed sweetly and merrily like the chuckle of a flute over the\nrippling waters, that rose higher and higher about them, and she turned\nher eyes askance and looked adown to her own sleek side, and laid her\nhand on it and laughed again.  Then said Ralph: \"What is toward,\nbeloved?  For thy laugh is rather of joy that of mirth alone.\"\n\nShe said:  \"O smooth-skinned warrior, O Lily and Rose of battle; here\non my side yesterday was the token of the hart's tyne that gored me\nwhen I was a young maiden five years ago: look now and pity the maiden\nthat lay on the grass of the forest, and the woodman a-passing by\ndeemed her dead five years ago.\"\n\nRalph stooped down as the ripple washed away from her, then said: \"In\nsooth here is no mark nor blemish, but the best handiwork of God, as\nwhen he first made a woman from the side of the Ancient Father of the\nfield of Damask.  But lo you love, how swift the tide cometh up, and I\nlong to see thy feet on the green grass, and I fear the sea, lest it\nstir the joy over strongly in our hearts and we be not able to escape\nfrom its waves.\"\n\nSo they went up from out of the water, and did on the hallowed raiment\nfragrant with strange herbs, and passed joyfully up the sand towards\nthe cliff and its stair; and speedily withal, for so soon as they were\nclad again, the little ripple of the sea was nigh touching their feet.\nAs they went, they noted that the waters of the Well flowed seaward\nfrom the black-walled pound by three arched openings in its outer face,\nand they beheld the mason's work, how goodly it was; for it was as if\nit had been cut out of the foot of a mountain, so well jointed were its\nstones, and its walls solid against any storm that might drive against\nit.\n\nThey climbed the stair, and sat them down on the green grass awhile\nwatching the ocean coming in over the sand and the rocks, and Ralph\nsaid: \"I will tell thee, sweetling, that I am grown eager for the road;\nthough true it is that whiles I was down yonder amidst the ripple of\nthe sea I longed for naught but thee, though thou wert beside me, and\nthy joyous words were as fire to the heart of my love.  But now that I\nam on the green grass of the earth I called to mind a dream that came\nto me when we slept after the precious draught of the Well: for\nmethought that I was standing before the porch of the Feast-hall of\nUpmeads and holding thine hand, and the ancient House spake to me with\nthe voice of a man, greeting both thee and me, and praising thy\ngoodliness and valiancy.  Surely then it is calling me to deeds, and if\nit were but morning, as it is now drawing towards sunset, we would\nmount and be gone straightway.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" she said, \"thou hast drunk of the Well, and the fear of thee\nhas already entered into the hearts of thy foemen far away, even as the\nlove of thee constraineth me as I lie by thy side; but since it is\nevening and sunset, let it be evening, and let the morning see to its\nown matters.  So now let us be pilgrims again, and eat the meal of\npilgrims, and see to our horses, and then wander about this lovely\nwilderness and its green meads, where no son of man heedeth the wild\nthings, till the night come, bringing to us the rest and the sleep of\nthem that have prevailed over many troubles.\"\n\nEven so they did, and broke bread above the sea, and looked to their\nhorses, and then went hand in hand about the goodly green bents betwixt\nthe sea and the rough of the mountain; and it was the fairest and\nsoftest of summer evenings; and the deer of that place, both little and\ngreat, had no fear of man, but the hart and hind came to Ursula's hand;\nand the thrushes perched upon her shoulder, and the hares gambolled\ntogether close to the feet of the twain; so that it seemed to them that\nthey had come into the very Garden of God; and they forgat all the many\nmiles of the waste and the mountain that lay before them, and they had\nno thought for the strife of foemen and the thwarting of kindred, that\nbelike awaited them in their own land, but they thought of the love and\nhappiness of the hour that was passing.  So sweetly they wore through\nthe last minutes of the day, and when it was as dark as it would be in\nthat fair season, they lay down by the green knoll at the ending of the\nland, and were lulled to sleep by the bubbling of the Well at the\nWorld's End.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR\n\nThe Road Home\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nRalph and Ursula Come Back Again Through the Great Mountains\n\n\nOn the morrow morning they armed them and took to their horses and\ndeparted from that pleasant place and climbed the mountain without\nweariness, and made provision of meat and drink for the Dry Desert, and\nso entered it, and journeyed happily with naught evil befalling them\ntill they came back to the House of the Sorceress; and of the Desert\nthey made little, and the wood was pleasant to them after the drought\nof the Desert.\n\nBut at the said House they saw those kind people, and they saw in their\neager eyes as in a glass how they had been bettered by their drinking\nof the Well, and the Elder said to them: \"Dear friends, there is no\nneed to ask you whether ye have achieved your quest; for ye, who before\nwere lovely, are now become as the very Gods who rule the world.  And\nnow methinks we have to pray you but one thing, to wit that ye will not\nbe overmuch of Gods, but will be kind and lowly with them that needs\nmust worship you.\"\n\nThey laughed on him for kindness' sake, and kissed and embraced the old\nman, and they thanked them all for their helping, and they abode with\nthem for a whole day in good-will and love, and thereafter the carle,\nwho was the son of the Elder, with his wife, bade farewell to his\nkinsmen, and led Ralph and Ursula back through the wood and over the\ndesert to the town of the Innocent Folk.  The said Folk received them\nin all joy and triumph, and would have them abide there the winter\nover.  But they prayed leave to depart, because their hearts were sore\nfor their own land and their kindred.  So they abode there but two\ndays, and on the third day were led away by a half score of men gaily\napparelled after their manner, and having with them many sumpter-beasts\nwith provision for the road.  With this fellowship they came safely and\nwith little pain unto Chestnut Vale, where they abode but one night,\nthough to Ralph and Ursula the place was sweet for the memory of their\nloving sojourn there.\n\nThey would have taken leave of the Innocent Folk in the said vale, but\nthose others must needs go with them a little further, and would not\nleave them till they were come to the jaws of the pass which led to the\nRock of the Fighting Man.  Further than that indeed they would not, or\ndurst not go; and those huge mountains they called the Wall of Strife,\neven as they on the other side called them the Wall of the World.\n\nSo the twain took leave of their friends there, and howbeit that they\nhad drunk of the Well at the World's End, yet were their hearts grieved\nat the parting.  The kind folk left with them abundant provision for\nthe remnant of the road, and a sumpter-ox to bear it; so they were in\nno doubt of their livelihood.  Moreover, though the turn of autumn was\ncome again and winter was at hand, yet the weather was fair and calm,\nand their journey through the dreary pass was as light as it might be\nto any men.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThey Hear New Tidings of Utterbol\n\n\nIt was on a fair evening of later autumn-tide that they won their way\nout of the Gates of the Mountains, and came under the rock of the\nFighting Man.  There they kissed and comforted each other in memory of\nthe terror and loneliness wherewith they had entered the Mountains that\nother time; though, sooth to say, it was to them now like the reading\nof sorrow in a book.\n\nBut when they came out with joyful hearts into the green plain betwixt\nthe mountains and the River of Lava, they looked westward, and beheld\nno great way off a little bower or cot, builded of boughs and rushes by\na blackthorn copse; and as they rode toward it they saw a man come\nforth therefrom, and presently saw that he was hoary, a man with a long\nwhite beard.  Then Ralph gave a glad cry, and set spurs to his horse\nand galloped over the plain; for he deemed that it could be none other\nthan the Sage of Swevenham; and Ursula came pricking after him laughing\nfor joy.  The old man abode their coming, and Ralph leapt off his horse\nat once, and kissed and embraced him; but the Sage said: \"There is no\nneed to ask thee of tidings; for thine eyes and thine whole body tell\nme that thou hast drunk of the Well at the World's End.  And that shall\nbe better for thee belike than it has been for me; though for me also\nthe world has not gone ill after my fashion since I drank of that\nwater.\"\n\nThen was Ursula come up, and she also lighted down and made much of the\nSage.  But he said:  \"Hail, daughter!  It is sweet to see thee so, and\nto wot that thou art in the hands of a mighty man: for I know that\nRalph thy man is minded for his Father's House, and the deeds that\nabide him there; and I think we may journey a little way together; for\nas for me, I would go back to Swevenham to end my days there, whether\nthey be long or short.\"\n\nBut Ralph said:  \"As for that, thou mayst go further than Swevenham,\nand as far as Upmeads, where there will be as many to love and cherish\nthee as at Swevenham.\"\n\nThe old man laughed a little, and reddened withal, but answered nothing.\n\nThen they untrussed their sumpter-beast, and took meat and drink from\nhis burden, and they ate and drank together, sitting on the green grass\nthere; and the twain made great joy of the Sage, and told him the whole\ntale; and he told them that he had been abiding there since the\nspring-tide, lest they might have turned back without accomplishing\ntheir quest, and then may-happen he should have been at hand to comfort\nthem, or the one of them left, if so it had befallen.  \"But,\" quoth he,\n\"since ye have verily drunk of the Well at the World's End, ye have\ncome back no later than I looked for you.\"\n\nThat night they slept in the bower there, and on the morrow betimes,\nthe Sage drove together three or four milch goats that he pastured\nthere, and went their ways over the plain, and so in due time entered\ninto the lava-sea. But the first night that they lay there, though it\nwas moonless and somewhat cloudy, they saw no glare of the distant\nearth-fires which they had looked for; and when on the morrow they\nquestioned the Sage thereof, he said: \"The Earth-fires ceased about the\nend of last year, as I have heard tell.  But sooth it is that the\nforeboding of the Giant's Candle was not for naught.  For there hath\nverily been a change of masters at Utterbol.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"for better or worse?\"\n\nSaid the Sage:  \"It could scarce have been for worse; but if rumour\nrunneth right it is much for the better.  Hearken how I learned\nthereof.  One fair even of late March, a little before I set off\nhither, as I was sitting before the door of my house, I saw the glint\nof steel through the wood, and presently rode up a sort of knights and\nmen-at-arms, about a score; and at the head of them a man on a big\nred-roan horse, with his surcoat blazoned with a white bull on a green\nfield: he was a man black-haired, but blue-eyed; not very big, but well\nknit and strong, and looked both doughty and knightly; and he wore a\ngold coronet about his basnet: so not knowing his blazonry, I wondered\nwho it was that durst be so bold as to ride in the lands of the Lord of\nUtterbol.  Now he rode up to me and craved a drink of milk, for he had\nseen my goats; so I milked two goats for him, and brought whey for the\nothers, whereas I had no more goats in milk at that season.  So the\nbull-knight spake to me about the woodland, and wherefore I dwelt there\napart from others; somewhat rough in his speech he was, yet rather\njolly than fierce; and he thanked me for the bever kindly enough, and\nsaid: \"I deem that it will not avail to give thee money; but I shall\ngive thee what may be of avail to thee.  Ho, Gervaise! give me one of\nthose scrolls!\"  So a squire hands him a parchment and he gave it me,\nand it was a safe-conduct to the bearer from the Lord of Utterbol; but\nwhereas I saw that the seal bore not the Bear on the Castle-wall, but\nthe Bull, and that the superscription was unknown to me, I held the\nsaid scroll in my hand and wondered; and the knight said to me: \"Yea,\nlook long at it; but so it is, though thou trow it not, that I am\nverily Lord of Utterbol, and that by conquest; so that belike I am\nmightier than he was, for that mighty runagate have I slain.  And many\nthere be who deem that no mishap, heathen though I be.  Come thou to\nUtterbol and see for thyself if the days be not changed there; and thou\nshalt have a belly-full of meat and drink, and honour after thy\ndeserving.\"  So they rested a while, and then went their ways.  To\nUtterbol I went not, but ere I departed to come hither two or three\ncarles strayed my way, as whiles they will, who told me that this which\nthe knight had said was naught but the sooth, and that great was the\nchange of days at Utterbol, whereas all men there, both bond and free,\nwere as merry as they deserved to be, or belike merrier.\"\n\nRalph pondered this tale, and was not so sure but that this new lord\nwas not Bull Shockhead, his wartaken thrall; natheless he held his\npeace; but Ursula said:  \"I marvel not much at the tale, for sure I am,\nthat had Gandolf of the Bear been slain when I was at Utterbol, neither\nman nor woman had stirred a finger to avenge him.  But all feared him,\nI scarce know why; and, moreover, there was none to be master if he\nwere gone.\"\n\nThereafter she told more tales of the miseries of Utterbol than Ralph\nhad yet heard, as though this tale of the end of that evil rule had set\nher free to utter them; and they fell to talking of others matters.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nThey Winter With the Sage; and Thereafter Come Again to Vale Turris\n\n\nThus with no peril and little pain they came to the Sage's hermitage;\nand whereas the autumn was now wearing, and it was not to be looked for\nthat they should cross even the mountains west of Goldburg, let alone\nthose to the west of Cheaping Knowe, when winter had once set in, Ralph\nand Ursula took the Sage's bidding to abide the winter through with\nhim, and set forth on their journey again when spring should be fairly\ncome and the mountain ways be clear of snow.\n\nSo they dwelt there happily enough; for they helped the Sage in his\nhusbandry, and he enforced him to make them cheer, and read in the\nancient book to them, and learned them as much as it behoved them to\nhearken; and told them tales of past time.\n\nThereafter when May was at hand they set out on their road, and whereas\nthe Sage knew the wood well, he made a long story short by bringing\nthem to Vale Turris in four days' time.  But when they rode down into\nthe dale, they saw the plain meads below the Tower all bright with\ntents and booths, and much folk moving about amidst them; here and\nthere amidst the roofs of cloth withal was showing the half finished\nframe of a timber house a-building. But now as they looked and wondered\nwhat might be toward, a half score of weaponed men rode up to them and\nbade them, but courteously, to come with them to see their Lord.  The\nSage drew forth his let-pass thereat; but the leader of the riders\nsaid, as he shook his head: \"That is good for thee, father; but these\ntwo knights must needs give an account of themselves:  for my lord is\nminded to put down all lifting throughout his lands; therefore hath he\nmade the meshes of his net small.  But if these be thy friends it will\nbe well.  Therefore thou art free to come with them and bear witness to\ntheir good life.\"\n\nHere it must be said that since they were on the road again Ursula had\ndonned her wargear once more, and as she rode was to all men's eyes\nnaught but a young and slender knight.\n\nSo without more ado they followed those men-at-arms, and saw how the\nbanner of the Bull was now hung out from the Tower; and the sergeants\nbrought them into the midst of the vale, where, about those tents and\nthose half-finished frame-houses (whereof they saw six) was a market\ntoward and much concourse of folk.  But the sergeants led through them\nand the lanes of the booths down to the side of the river, where on a\ngreen knoll, with some dozen of men-at-arms and captains about him, sat\nthe new Lord of Utterbol.\n\nNow as the others drew away from him to right and left, the Lord sat\nbefore Ralph with naught to hide him, and when their eyes met Ralph\ngave a cry as one astonished; and the Lord of Utterbol rose up to his\nfeet and shouted, and then fell a laughing joyously, and then cried\nout:  \"Welcome, King's Son, and look on me! for though the feathers be\nfine 'tis the same bird.  I am Lord of Utterbol and therewithal Bull\nShockhead, whose might was less than thine on the bent of the mountain\nvalley.\"\n\nTherewith he caught hold of Ralph's hand, and sat himself down and drew\nRalph down, and made him sit beside him.\n\n\"Thou seest I am become great?\" said he.  \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"I give\nthee joy thereof!\"  Said the new Lord: \"Perchance thou wilt be deeming\nthat since I was once thy war-taken thrall I should give myself up to\nthee: but I tell thee I will not:  for I have much to do here.\nMoreover I did not run away from thee, but thou rannest from me, lad.\"\n\nThereat in his turn Ralph fell a laughing, and when he might speak he\nsaid: \"What needeth the lord of all these spears to beg off his service\nto the poor wandering knight?\"\n\nThen Bull put his arms about him, and said: \"I am fain at the sight of\nthee, time was thou wert a kind lad and a good master; yet naught so\nmerry as thou shouldest have been; but now I see that gladness plays\nall about thy face, and sparkles in thine eyes; and that is good.  But\nthese thy fellows?  I have seen the old carle before: he was dwelling\nin the wildwood because he was overwise to live with other folk.  But\nthis young man, who may he be?  Or else--yea, verily, it is a young\nwoman.  Yea, and now I deem that it is the thrall of my brother Bull\nNosy.  Therefore by heritage she is now mine.\"\n\nRalph heard the words but saw not the smiling face, so wroth he was;\ntherefore the bare sword was in his fist in a twinkling.  But ere he\ncould smite Bull caught hold of his wrist, and said: \"Master, master,\nthou art but a sorry lawyer, or thou wouldst have said: 'Thou art my\nthrall, and how shall a thrall have heritage?' Dost thou not see that I\ncannot own her till I be free, and that thou wilt not give me my\nfreedom save for hers?  There, now is all the matter of the service\nduly settled, and I am free and a Lord.  And this damsel is free also,\nand--yea, is she not thy well-beloved, King's Son?\"\n\nRalph was somewhat abashed, and said:  \"I crave thy pardon, Lord, for\nmisdoubting thee:  but think how feeble are we two lovers amongst the\nhosts of the aliens.\"\n\n\"It is well, it is well,\" said Bull, \"and in very sooth I deem thee my\nfriend; and this damsel was my brother's friend.  Sit down, dear\nmaiden, I bid thee; and thou also, O man overwise; and let us drink a\ncup, and then we will talk about what we may do for each other.\"\n\nSo they sat down all on the grass, and the Lord of Utterbol called for\nwine, and they drank together in the merry season of May; and the new\nLord said:  \"Here be we friends come together, and it were pity of our\nlives if we must needs sunder speedily: howbeit, it is thou must rule\nherein, King's Son; for in my eyes thou art still greater than I, O my\nmaster.  For I can see in thine eyes and thy gait, and in thine also,\nmaiden, that ye have drunk of the Well at the World's End.  Therefore I\npray you gently and heartily that ye come home with me to Utterbol.\"\n\nRalph shook his head, and answered:  \"Lord of Utterbol, I bid thee all\nthanks for thy friendliness, but it may not be.\"\n\n\"But take note,\" said Bull, \"that all is changed there, and it hath\nbecome a merry dwelling of men.  We have cast down the Red Pillar, and\nthe White and the Black also; and it is no longer a place of torment\nand fear, and cozening and murder; but the very thralls are happy and\nfree-spoken. Now come ye, if it were but for a moon's wearing: I shall\nbe there in eight days' time.  Yea, Lord Ralph, thou would'st see old\nacquaintance there withal:  for when I slew the tyrant, who forsooth\nowed me no less than his life for the murder of my brother, I made\natonement to his widow, and wedded her: a fair woman as thou wottest,\nlord, and of good kindred, and of no ill conditions, as is well seen\nnow that she lives happy days.  Though I have heard say that while she\nwas under the tyrant she was somewhat rough with her women when she was\nsad.  Eh, fair sir!  but is it not so that she cast sheep's eyes on\nthee, time was, in this same dale?\"\n\nRalph reddened and answered naught; and Bull spake again, laughing:\n\"Yea, so it is:  she told me that much herself, and afterwards I heard\nmore from her damsel Agatha, who told me the merry tale of that device\nthey made to catch thee, and how thou brakest through the net.\nForsooth, though this she told me not, I deem that she would have had\nthe same gift of thee as her mistress would.  Well, lad, lucky are they\nwith whom all women are in love.  So now I prithee trust so much in thy\nluck as to come with me to Utterbol.\"\n\nQuoth Ralph:  \"Once again, Lord of Utterbol, we thank thee; but whereas\nthou hast said that thou hast much to do in this land; even so I have a\nland where deeds await me.  For I stole myself away from my father and\nmother, and who knows what help they need of me against foemen, and\nevil days; and now I might give help to them were I once at home, and\nto the people of the land also, who are a stout-hearted and valiant and\nkindly folk.\"\n\nThe new Lord's face clouded somewhat, as he said:  \"If thine heart\ndraweth thee to thy kindred, there is no more to say.  As for me, what\nI did was for kindred's sake, and then what followed after was the work\nof need.  Well, let it be!  But since we must needs part hastily, this\nat least I bid you, that ye abide with me for to-night, and the banquet\nin the great pavilion.  Howsoever ye may be busied, gainsay me not\nthis; and to-morrow I shall further you on your way, and give you a\nscore of spears to follow thee to Goldburg.  Then as for Goldburg and\nCheaping Knowe, see ye to it yourselves: but beyond Cheaping Knowe and\nthe plain country, thy name is known, and the likeness of thee told in\nwords; and no man in those mountains shall hurt or hinder thee, but all\nthou meetest shall aid and further thee.  Moreover, at the feast\nto-night thou shalt see thy friend Otter, and he and I betwixt us shall\ntell thee how I came to Utterbol, and of the change of days, and how it\nbetid.  For he is now my right-hand man, as he was of the dead man.\nForsooth, after the slaying I would have had him take the lordship of\nUtterbol, but he would not, so I must take it perforce or be slain, and\nlet a new master reign there little better than the old.  Well then,\nhow sayest thou?  Or wilt thou run from me without leave-taking, as\nthou didst ere-while at Goldburg?\"\n\nRalph laughed at his word, and said that he would not be so churlish\nthis time, but would take his bidding with a good heart; and thereafter\nthey fell to talking of many things.  But Ralph took note of Bull, that\nnow his hair and beard were trim and his raiment goodly, for all his\nrough speech and his laughter and heart-whole gibes and mocking, his\naspect and bearing was noble and knightly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nA Feast in the Red Pavilion\n\n\nSo in a while they went with him to the Tower, and there was woman's\nraiment of the best gotten for Ursula, and afterwards at nightfall they\nwent to the feast in the Red Pavillion of Utterbol, which awhile ago\nthe now-slain Lord of Utterbol had let make; and it was exceeding rich\nwith broidery of pearl and gems: since forsooth gems and fair women\nwere what the late lord had lusted for the most, and have them he would\nat the price of howsoever many tears and groans.  But that pavilion was\nyet in all wise as it was wont to be, saving that the Bull had\nsupplanted the Bear upon the Castle-wall.\n\nNow the wayfarers were treated with all honour and were set upon the\nhigh-seat, Ralph upon the right-hand of the Lord, and Ursula upon his\nleft, and the Sage of Swevenham out from her.  But on Ralph's right\nhand was at first a void place, whereto after a while came Otter, the\nold Captain of the Guard.  He came in hastily, and as though he had but\njust taken his armour off: for his raiment was but such as the\nmen-at-arm of that country were wont to wear under their war-gear, and\nwas somewhat stained and worn; whereas the other knights and lords were\narrayed grandly in silks and fine cloth embroidered and begemmed.\n\nOtter was fain when he saw Ralph, and kissed and embraced him, and\nsaid: \"Forsooth, I saw by thy face, lad, that the world would be soft\nbefore thee; and now that I behold thee I know already that thou hast\nwon thy quest; and the Gods only know to what honour thou shalt attain.\"\n\nRalph laughed for joy of him, and yet said soberly:  \"As to honour,\nmeseems I covet little world's goods, save that it may be well with my\nfolk at home.\" Nevertheless as the words were out of his mouth his\nthought went back to the tall man whom he had first met at the\nchurchyard gate of Netherton, and it seemed to him that he wished his\nthriving, yea, and in a lesser way, he wished the same to Roger of the\nRope-walk, whereas he deemed that both of these, each in his own way,\nhad been true to the lady whom he had lost.\n\nThen Otter fell a-talking to him of the change of days at Utterbol, and\nhow that it was the Lord's intent that a cheaping town should grow up\nin the Dale of the Tower, and that the wilderness beyond it should be\ntilled and builded.  \"And,\" said he, \"if this be done, and the new lord\nlive to see it, as he may, being but young of years, he may become\nexceedingly mighty, and if he hold on in the way whereas he now is, he\nshall be well-beloved also.\"\n\nSo they spake of many things, and there was minstrelsy and diverse\njoyance, till at last the Lord of Utterbol stood up and said:  \"Now\nbring in the Bull, that we may speak some words over him; for this is a\ngreat feast.\" Ralph wondered what bull this might be whereof he spake;\nbut the harps and fiddlers, and all instruments of music struck up a\ngay and gallant tune, and presently there came into the hall four men\nrichly attired, who held up on spears a canopy of bawdekin, under which\nwent a man-at-arms helmed, and clad in bright armour, who held in his\nhands a great golden cup fashioned like to a bull, and he bore it forth\nunto the dais, and gave it into the hands of the Lord.  Then\nstraightway all the noise ceased, and the glee and clatter of the hall,\nand there was dead silence.  Then the Lord held the cup aloft and said\nin a loud voice:\n\n\"Hail, all ye folk!  I swear by the Bull, and they that made him, that\nin three years' time or less I will have purged all the lands of\nUtterbol of all strong-thieves and cruel tyrants, be they big or\nlittle, till all be peace betwixt the mountains and the mark of\nGoldburg; and the wilderness shall blossom like the rose.  Or else\nshall I die in the pain.\"\n\nTherewith he drank of the cup, and all men shouted.  Then he sat him\ndown and bade hand the cup to Otter; and Otter took the cup and looked\ninto the bowl and saw the wave of wine, and laughed and cried out: \"As\nfor me, what shall I swear but that I will follow the Bull through\nthick and thin, through peace and unpeace, through grief and joy.  This\nis my oath-swearing.\"\n\nAnd he drank mightily and sat down.\n\nThen turned the Lord to Ralph and said:  \"And thou who art my master,\nwilt thou not tell thy friends and the Gods what thou wilt do?\"\n\n\"No great matter, belike,\" said Ralph; \"but if ye will it, I will speak\nout my mind thereon.\"\n\n\"We will it,\" said the Lord.\n\nThen Ralph arose and took the cup and lifted it and spake: \"This I\nswear, that I will go home to my kindred, yet on the road will I not\ngainsay help to any that craveth it.  So may all Hallows help me!\"\n\nTherewith he drank:  and Bull said:  \"This is well said, O happy man!\nBut now that men have drunk well, do ye three and Otter come with me\ninto the Tower, whereas the chambers are dight for you, that I may make\nthe most of this good day wherein I have met thee again.\"\n\nSo they went with him, and when they had sat down in the goodliest\nchamber of the Tower, and they had been served with wine and spices,\nthe new Lord said to Ralph:  \"And now, my master, wilt thou not ask\nsomewhat concerning me?\"  \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"I will ask thee to tell\nthe tale of how thou camest into thy Lordship.\" Said the Lord, \"This\nshall ye hear of me with Otter to help me out.  Hearken!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nBull Telleth of His Winning of the Lordship of Utterbol\n\n\n\"When thou rannest away from me, and left me alone at Goldburg, I was\ngrieved; then Clement Chapman offered to take me back with him to his\nown country, which, he did me to wit, lieth hard by thine: but I would\nnot go with him, since I had an inkling that I should find the slayer\nof my brother and be avenged on him.  So the Chapmen departed from\nGoldburg after that Clement had dealt generously by me for thy sake;\nand when they were gone I bethought me what to do, and thou knowest I\ncan some skill with the fiddle and song, so I betook myself to that\ncraft, both to earn somewhat and that I might gather tidings and be\nlittle heeded, till within awhile folk got to know me well, and would\noften send for me to their merry-makings, where they gave me fiddler's\nwages, to wit, meat, drink, and money.  So what with one thing what\nwith another I was rich enough to leave Goldburg and fall to my journey\nunto Utterbol; since I misdoubted me from the first that the caytiff\nwho had slain my brother was the Lord thereof.\n\n\"But one day when I went into the market-place I found a great stir and\nclutter there; some folk, both men and women screeching and fleeing,\nand some running to bows and other weapons.  So I caught hold of one of\nthe fleers, and asked him what was toward; and he cried out, 'Loose me!\nlet me go! he is loose, he is loose!'\n\n\"'Who is loose, fool?' quoth I. 'The lion,' said he, and therewith in\nthe extremity of his terror tore himself away from me and fled.  By\nthis time the others also had got some distance away from me, and I was\nleft pretty much alone.  So I went forth on a little, looking about me,\nand sure enough under one of the pillars of the cloister beneath the\nmarket-house (the great green pillar, if thou mindest it), lay crouched\na huge yellow lion, on the carcase of a goat, which he had knocked\ndown, but would not fall to eating of amidst all that cry and hubbub.\n\n\"Now belike one thing of me thou wottest not, to wit, that I have a\ngift that wild things love and will do my bidding.  The house-mice will\nrun over me as I lie awake looking on them; the small birds will perch\non my shoulders without fear; the squirrels and hares will gambol about\nquite close to me as if I were but a tree; and, withal, the fiercest\nhound or mastiff is tame before me.  Therefore I feared not this lion,\nand, moreover, I looked to it that if I might tame him thoroughly, he\nwould both help me to live as a jongleur, and would be a sure ward to\nme.\n\n\"So I walked up towards him quietly, till he saw me and half rose up\ngrowling; but I went on still, and said to him in a peaceable voice:\n'How now, yellow mane! what aileth thee? down with thee, and eat thy\nmeat.' So he sat down to his quarry again, but growled still, and I\nwent up close to him, and said to him:  'Eat in peace and safety, am I\nnot here?' And therewith I held out my bare hand unclenched to him, and\nhe smelt to it, and straightway began to be peaceable, and fell to\ntearing the goat, and devouring it, while I stood by speaking to him\nfriendly.\n\n\"But presently I saw weapons glitter on the other side of the square\nplace, and men with bended bows.  The yellow king saw them also, and\nrose up again and stood growling; then I strove to quiet him, and said,\n'These shall not harm thee.'\n\n\"Therewith the men cried out to me to come away, for they would shoot:\nBut I called out; 'Shoot not yet! but tell me, does any man own this\nbeast?' 'Yea,' said one, 'I own him, and happy am I that he doth not\nown me.' Said I, 'Wilt thou sell him?'  'Yea' said he, 'if thou livest\nanother hour to tell down the money.'  Said I, 'I am a tamer of wild\nbeasts, and if thou wilt sell this one at such a price, I will rid thee\nof him.' The man yeasaid this, but kept well aloof with his fellows,\nwho looked on, handling their weapons.\n\n\"Then I turned to my new-bought thrall and bade him come with me, and\nhe followed me like a dog to his cage, which was hard by; and I shut\nhim in there, and laid down the money to his owner; and folk came round\nabout, and wondered, and praised me.  But I said:  'My masters, have ye\nnaught of gifts for the tamer of beasts, and the deliverer of men?'\nThereat they laughed: but they brought me money and other goods, till I\nhad gotten far more than I had given for the lion.\n\n\"Howbeit the next day the officers of the Porte came and bade me avoid\nthe town of Goldburg, but gave me more money withal.  I was not loth\nthereto, but departed, riding a little horse that I had, and leading my\nlion by a chain, though when I was by he needed little chaining.\n\n\"So that without more ado I took the road to Utterbol, and wheresoever\nI came, I had what was to be had that I would; neither did any man fall\non me, or on my lion.  For though they might have shot him or slain him\nwith many spear-thrusts, yet besides that they feared him sorely, they\nfeared me still more; deeming me some mighty sending from their Gods.\n\n\"Thus came I to Utterness, and found it poor and wretched, (as\nforsooth, it yet is, but shall not be so for long). But the House of\nUtterbol is exceeding fair and stately (as thou mightest have learned\nfrom others, my master,) and its gardens, and orchards, and acres, and\nmeadows as goodly as may be.  Yea, a very paradise; yet the dwellers\ntherein as if it were hell, as I saw openly with mine own eyes.\n\n\"To be short, the fame of me and my beast had somehow gone before me,\nand when I came to the House, I was dealt with fairly, and had good\nentertainment: and this all the more, as the Lord was away for a while,\nand the life of folk not so hard by a great way as it had been if he\nhad been there: but the Lady was there in the house, and on the morrow\nof my coming by her command, I brought my lion before her window and\nmade him come and go, and fetch and carry at my bidding, and when I had\ndone my play she bade me up into her bower, and bade me sit and had me\nserved with wine, while she asked me many questions as to my country\nand friends, and whence and whither I was; and I answered her with the\nvery sooth, so far as the sooth was handy; and there was with her but\none of her women, even thy friend Agatha, fair sir.\n\n\"Methought both that this Queen was a fair woman, and that she looked\nkindly upon me, and at last she said, sighing, that she were well at\nease if her baron were even such a man as I, whereas the said Lord was\nfierce and cruel, and yet a dastard withal.  But the said Agatha turned\non her, and chided her, as one might with a child, and said: 'Hold thy\npeace of thy loves and thy hates before a very stranger!  Or must I\nleave yet more of my blood on the pavement of the White Pillar, for the\npleasure of thy loose tongue?  Come out now, mountain-carle!'\n\n\"And she took me by the hand and led me out, and when we had passed the\ndoor and it was shut, she turned to me and said: 'Thou, if I hear any\nword abroad of what my Lady has just spoken, I shall know that thou\nhast told it, and though I be but a thrall, yea, and of late a\nmishandled one, yet am I of might enough in Utterbol to compass thy\ndestruction.'\n\n\"I laughed in her face and went my ways:  and thereafter I saw many\nfolk and showed them my beast, and soon learned two things clearly.\n\n\"And first that the Lord and the Lady were now utterly at variance.\nFor a little before he had come home, and found a lack in his\nhousehold--to wit, how a certain fair woman whom he had but just got\nhold of, and whom he lusted after sorely, was fled away.  And he laid\nthe wyte thereof on his Lady, and threatened her with death: and when\nhe considered that he durst not slay her, or torment her (for he was\nverily but a dastard), he made thy friend Agatha pay for her under\npretence of wringing a true tale out of her.\n\n\"Now when I heard this story I said to myself that I should hear that\nother one of the slaying of my brother, and even so it befell.  For I\ncame across a man who told me when and how the Lord came by the said\ndamsel (whom I knew at once could be none other than thou, Lady,) and\nhow he had slain my brother to get her, even as doubtless thou knowest,\nLord Ralph.\n\n\"But the second thing which I learned was that all folk at Utterbol,\nmen and women, dreaded the home-coming of this tyrant; and that there\nwas no man but would have deemed it a good deed to slay him.  But,\ndastard as he was, use and wont, and the fear that withholdeth rebels,\nand the doubt that draweth back slaves, saved him; and they dreaded him\nmoreover as a devil rather than a man.  Forsooth one of the men there,\nwho looked upon me friendly, who had had tidings of this evil beast\ndrawing near, spake to me a word of warning, and said:  'Friend\nlion-master, take heed to thyself!  For I fear for thee when the Lord\ncometh home and findeth thee here; lest he let poison thy lion and slay\nthee miserably afterward.'\n\n\"Well, in three days from that word home cometh the Lord with a rout of\nhis spearmen, and some dozen of captives, whom he had taken.  And the\nmorrow of his coming, he, having heard of me, sent and bade me showing\nthe wonder of the Man and the Lion; therefore in the bright morning I\nplayed with the lion under his window as I had done by the Queen.  And\nafter I had played some while, and he looking out of the window, he\ncalled to me and said:  'Canst thou lull thy lion to sleep, so that\nthou mayst leave him for a little?  For I would fain have thee up here.'\n\n\"I yeasaid that, and chid the beast, and then sang to him till he lay\ndown and slept like a hound weary with hunting.  And then I went up\ninto the Lord's chamber; and as it happed, all the while of my playing\nI had had my short-sword naked in my hand, and thus, I deem without\nnoting it, yet as weird would, I came before the tyrant, where he sat\nwith none anigh him save this Otter and another man-at-arms. But when I\nsaw him, all the blood within me that was come of one mother with my\nbrother's blood stirred within me, and I set my foot on the foot-pace\nof this murderer's chair, and hove up my short-sword, and clave his\nskull, in front and with mine own hand: not as he wrought, not as he\nwrought with my brother.\n\n\"Then I turned about to Otter (who had his sword in his fist when it\nwas too late) till he should speak.  Hah Otter, what didst thou say?\"\n\nOtter laughed:  Quoth he, \"I said:  thus endeth the worst man in the\nworld.  Well done, lion-tamer! thou art no ill guest, and hast paid on\nthe nail for meat, drink and lodging.  But what shall we do now?  Then\nthou saidst; 'Well, I suppose thou wilt be for slaying me.' 'Nay,' said\nI, 'We will not slay thee; at least not for this, nor now, nor without\nterms.'  Thou saidst:  'Perchance then thou wilt let me go free, since\nthis man was ill-beloved: yea, and he owed me a life.' 'Nay, nay,' said\nI, 'not so fast, good beast-lord.' 'Why not?' saidst thou, 'I can see\nof thee that thou art a valiant man, and whereas thou hast been captain\nof the host, and the men-at-arms will lightly do thy bidding, why\nshouldest thou not sit in the place of this man, and be Lord of\nUtterbol?'\n\n\"'Nay nay,' said I, 'it will not do, hearken thou rather: For here I\ngive thee the choice of two things, either that thou be Lord of\nUtterbol, or that we slay thee here and now.  For we be two men\nall-armed.'\n\n\"Thou didst seem to ponder it a while, and then saidst at last: 'Well,\nI set not out on this journey with any such-like intent; yet will I not\nwrestle with weird.  Only I forewarn thee that I shall change the days\nof Utterbol.'\n\n\"'It will not be for the worst then,' quoth I. 'So now go wake up thy\nlion, and lead him away to his den:  and we will presently send him\nthis carrion for a reward of his jonglery.' 'Gramercy, butcher,' saidst\nthou, 'I am not for thy flesh-meat to-day. I was forewarned that the\npoor beast should be poisoned at this man's home-coming, and so will he\nbe if he eat of this dastard; he will not outlive such a dinner.'\nThereat we all laughed heartily.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Bull, \"So I went to lead away the lion when thou hadst\nbidden me return in an hours' wearing, when all should be ready for my\nLordship.  And thou wert not worse than thy word, for when I came into\nthat court again, there were all the men-at-arms assembled, and the\nfree carles, and the thralls; and the men-at-arms raised me on a\nshield, set a crowned helm on my head, and thrust a great sword into my\nhand, and hailed me by the name of the Bull of Utterbol, Lord of the\nWaste and the Wildwood, and the Mountain-side: and then thou, Otter,\nwert so simple as to kneel before me and name thyself my man, and take\nthe girding on of sword at my hand.  Then even as I was I went in to my\nLady and told her the end of my tale, and in three minutes she lay in\nmy arms, and in three days in my bed as my wedded wife.  As to Agatha,\nwhen I had a little jeered her, I gave her rich gifts and good lands,\nand freedom, to boot her for her many stripes.  And lo there, King's\nSon and Sweet Lady, the end of all my tale.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth Otter, \"saving this, that even already thou has raised up\nUtterbol from Hell to Earth, and yet meseemeth thou hast good-will to\nraise it higher.\"\n\nBull reddened at his word, and said:  \"Tush, man! praise the day when\nthe sun has set.\"  Then he turned to Ralph, and said: \"Yet couldst thou\nat whiles put in a good word for me here and there amongst the folks\nthat thou shalt pass through on thy ways home, I were fain to know that\nI had a well-speaking friend abroad.\" \"We shall do no less,\" said\nRalph; and Ursula spake in like wise.\n\nSo they talked together merrily a while longer, till night began to\ngrow old, and then went to their chambers in all content and\ngood-liking.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nThey Ride From Vale Turris.  Redhead Tells of Agatha\n\n\nOn the morrow when they arose, Ralph heard the sound of horses and the\nclashing of arms:  he went to the window, and looked out, and saw how\nthe spears stood up thick together at the Tower's foot, and knew that\nthese were the men who were to be his fellows by the way.  Their\ncaptain he saw, a big man all-armed in steel, but himseemed that he\nknew his face under his sallet, and presently saw that it was Redhead.\nHe was glad thereof, and clad himself hastily, and went out a-doors,\nand went up to him and hailed him, and Redhead leapt off his horse, and\ncast his arms about Ralph, and made much of him, and said: \"It is good\nfor sore eyes to see thee, lord; and I am glad at heart that all went\nwell with thee that time.  Although, forsooth, there was guile behind\nit.  Yet whereas I wotted nothing thereof, which I will pray thee to\nbelieve, and whereas thou hast the gain of all, I deem thou mayst\npardon me.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Thou hast what pardon of me thou needest; so be content.\nFor the rest, little need is there to ask if thou thrivest, for I\nbehold thee glad and well honoured.\"\n\nAs they spoke came the Lord forth from the Tower, and said: \"Come thou,\nLord Ralph, and eat with us ere thou takest to the road; I mean with\nOtter and me.  As for thee, Redhead, if aught of ill befall this King's\nSon under thy way-leading, look to it that thou shalt lose my good word\nwith Agatha; yea, or gain my naysay herein; whereby thou shalt miss\nboth fee and fair dame.\"\n\nRedhead looked sheepishly on Ralph at that word, yet winked at him\nalso, as if it pleased him to be jeered concerning his wooing; so that\nRalph saw how the land lay, and that the guileful handmaid was not ill\ncontent with that big man.  So he smiled kindly on him and nodded, and\nwent back with Bull into the Tower.  There they sat down all to meat\ntogether; and when they were done with their victual, Bull spake, and\nsaid to Ralph: \"Fair King's Son, is this then the last sight of thee?\nwilt thou never come over the mountains again?\"  Said Ralph:  \"Who\nknoweth?  I am young yet, and have drunk of the Water of the Well.\"\nBull grew somewhat pensive and said:  \"Yea, thou meanest that thou\nmayest come back and find me no longer here.  Yet if thou findest but\nmy grave-mound, yet mayhappen thou shalt come on something said or sung\nof me, which shall please thee.  For I will tell thee, that thou hast\nchanged my conditions; how, I wot not.\"\n\n\"Thy word is good,\" said Ralph, \"yet I meant not that; never should I\ncome to Utterbol if I looked not to find thee living there.\" Bull\nsmiled on him as though he loved him, and said: \"This is well spoken; I\nshall look to see thee before I die.\"\n\nThen said Ursula:  \"Lord of Utterbol, this also thou mayst think on,\nthat it is no further from Utterbol to Upmeads than from Upmeads to\nUtterbol.\" The Lord laughed and said:  \"Sooth is that; and were but my\nBull here, as I behold you I should be of mind to swear by him to come\nand see you at Upmeads ere ten years have worn.\"\n\nThen she put forth her hand and said:  \"Swear by this!\" So he took it\nand swore the oath; but the Sage of Swevenham said: \"This oath thou\nshalt keep to the gain and not the loss both of thee and of thy friends\nof Upmeads.\"\n\nThus were they fain of each other, and Ralph saw how Bull's heart was\ngrown big, and he rejoiced thereat.  But anon he arose and said: \"Now,\nLord, we ask leave to depart for the way is long, and mayhappen my\nkindred now lack a man's helping.\"  Then Bull stood up and called for\nhis horse, and Otter also, and they all went forth and gat a-horseback\nand rode away from Vale Turris, and Redhead rode behind them humbly,\ntill it was noon and they made stay for meat.  Then after they had\nbroken bread together and drunk a cup Bull and Otter kissed the\nwayfarers, and bade them farewell and so rode back to Vale Turris, and\nRalph and Ursula and the Sage tarried not but rode on their ways.\n\nBut anon Ralph called to Redhead, and bade him ride beside them that\nthey might talk together, and he came up with them, and Ursula greeted\nhim kindly, and they were merry one with another.  And Ralph said to\nRedhead:  \"Friend captain, thou art exceeding in humility not to ride\nwith the Lord or Captain Otter; save for chance-hap, I see not that\nthou art worser than they.\"\n\nRedhead grinned, and said:  \"Well, as to Otter, that is all true; but\nas for Lord Bull it is another matter; I wot not but his kindred may be\nas good or better than any in these east parts.  In any case, he hath\nhis kin and long descent full often in his mouth, while I am but a\ngangrel body.  Howbeit it is all one, whereas whatso he or Otter bid\nany man to do, he doeth it, but my bidding may be questioned at whiles.\nAnd look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a\nchange of days?  Sooth to say, both these great lords have done well by\nme.\"\n\nRalph laughed:  \"And better will they do, as thou deemest; give thee\nAgatha, to wit?\"  \"Yea, fair sir,\" quoth Redhead.  \"No great gift, that\nseemeth to me, for thy valiancy,\" said Ralph; \"she is guileful enough\nand loose enough for a worse man than thee.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Redhead, \"even of her thou shalt say what pleaseth thee;\nbut no other man shall say of her what pleaseth me not.  For all that\nis come and gone she is true and valiant, and none may say that she is\nnot fair and sweet enough for a better man than me; and my great good\nluck it is that, as I hope, she looketh no further for a better.\"\n\nUrsula said:  \"Is it so, perchance, that now she is free and hath\nnaught to fear, she hath no need for guile?\" \"Hail to thee for thy\nword, lady,\" quoth Redhead; and then he was silent, glooming somewhat\non Ralph.\n\nBut Ralph said:  \"Nay, my friend, I meant no harm, but I was wondering\nwhat had befallen to bring you two so close together.\"\n\n\"It was fear and pain, and the helping of each other that wrought it,\"\nsaid Redhead.  Said Ursula:  \"Good Captain, how was it that she escaped\nthe uttermost of evil at the tyrant's hands? since from all that I have\nheard, it must needs be that he laid the blame on her (working for her\nmistress) of my flight from Utterbol.\"\n\n\"Even so it was, lady,\" said Redhead; \"but, as thou wottest belike, she\nhad got it spread abroad that she was cunning in sorcery, and that her\nspell would not end when her life ended; nay, that he to whom her ghost\nshould bear ill-will, and more especially such an one as might compass\nher death, should have but an ill time of it while he lived, which\nshould not be long.  This tale, which, sooth to say, I myself helped to\nspread, the Lord of Utterbol trowed in wholly, so cunningly was it\ntold; so that, to make a long story short, he feared her, and feared\nher more dead than living.  So that when he came home, and found thee\ngone, lady, he did indeed deem that thy flight was of Agatha's\ncontrivance.  And this the more because his nephew (he whom thou didst\nbeguile; I partly guess how) told him a made-up tale how all was done\nby the spells of Agatha.  For this youth was of all men, not even\nsaving his uncle, most full of malice; and he hated Agatha, and would\nhave had her suffer the uttermost of torments and he to be standing by\nthe while; howbeit his malice overshot itself, since his tale made her\neven more of a witch than the lord deemed before.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ursula, \"and what hath befallen that evil young man,\nCaptain?\"  Said Redhead:  \"It is not known to many, lady; but two days\nbefore the slaying of his uncle, I met him in a wood a little way from\nUtterbol, and, the mood being on me I tied him neck and heels and cast\nhim, with a stone round his neck, into a deep woodland pool hight the\nRam's Bane, which is in that same wood.  Well, as to my tale of Agatha.\nWhen the lord came home first, he sent for her, and his rage had so\nmastered his fear for a while that his best word was scourge and rack\nand faggot; but she was, outwardly, so calm and cold, smiling on him\nbalefully, that he presently came to himself, a found that fear was in\nhis belly, and that he might not do what he would with her; wherefore\nhe looked to it that however she were used (which was ill enough, God\nwot!) she should keep the soul in her body.  And at last the fear so\nmounted into his head that he made peace with her, and even craved\nforgiveness of her and gave her gifts.  She answered him sweetly\nindeed, yet so as he (and all others who were bystanding, of whom I was\none,) might well see that she deemed she owed him a day in harvest.  As\nfor me, he heeded me naught, and I lay low all I might.  And in any\nwise we wore the time till the great day of deliverance.\"\n\nTherewith dropped the talk about Agatha, when they had bidden him all\nluck in his life.  Forsooth, they were fain of his words, and of his\nways withal.  For he was a valiant man, and brisk, and one who forgat\nno benefit, and was trusty as steel; merry-hearted withal, and kind and\nready of speech despite his uplandish manners, which a life not a\nlittle rude had thrust on him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nOf Their Riding the Waste, and of a Battle Thereon\n\n\nThey slept in no house that night nor for many nights after; for they\nwere now fairly on the waste.  They bore with them a light tent for\nUrsula's lodging benights, and the rest of them slept on the field as\nthey might; or should they come to a thicket or shaw, they would lodge\nthem there softly.  Victual and drink failed them not, for they bore\nwhat they needed on sumpter-horses, and shot some venison on the way\nwithal.  They saw but few folk; for the most part naught save a fowler\nof the waste, or a peat-cutter, who stood to look on the men-at-arms\ngoing by, and made obeisance to the token of Utterbol.\n\nBut on a time, the fifth day of their journey, they saw, in the\nmorning, spears not a few standing up against a thicket-side in the\noffing.  Redhead looked under the sharp of his hand, and laughed as\nthough he were glad, and said:  \"I know not clearly what these may be,\nbut it looketh like war.  Now, knight, this is best to do: hold with\nthee three of our best men, so that ye may safe guard the Lady, and I\nwith the others will prick on and look into this.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"thou mayst yet be apaid of a man's aid; and if\nthere be strokes on sale in the cheaping-stead yonder, I will deal\nalong with thee.  Leave thy three men with the Lady, and let us on; we\nshall soon be back.\"\n\n\"Nay once more, dear lord,\" quoth Ursula, \"I fear to be left alone of\nthee, and it is meet that thou free me from fear.  I will ride with\nyou, but three horse-lengths behind, so as not to hinder you.  I have\nbeen worse bestead than this shall be.\"\n\n\"It is good,\" quoth Redhead, \"let her ride with us: for why should she\nsuffer the pain of fear in the lonely waste?  But let her do on a\nhauberk over her coats, and steel coif over her head, for shaft and\nbolt will ofttimes go astray.\"\n\nEven so they did, and rode forward, and presently they saw the spearmen\nthat they were somewhat more than their company, and that they were\nwell mounted on black horses and clad in black armour.  Then they drew\nrein for awhile and Redhead scanned them again and said: \"Yea, these\nare the men of the brother of thy hot wooer, Lady Ursula, whom I cooled\nin the Ram's Bane, but a man well nigh as old as his uncle, though he\nhath not made men tremble so sore, albeit he be far the better man, a\ngood warrior, a wise leader, a reiver and lifter well wrought at all\npoints.  Well, 'tis not unlike that we shall have to speak to his men\nagain, either out-going or home-coming: so we had best kill as many of\nthese as we may now.  Do on thy sallet, my lord; and thou,\nMichael-a-green shake out the Bull; and thou, our Noise, blow a point\nof war that they may be warned.  God to aid! but they be ready and\nspeedy!\"\n\nIn sooth even as the pennon of the Bull ran down the wind and the\nUtterbol horn was winded, the Black men-at-arms came on at a trot, and\npresently with a great screeching yell cast their spears into the rest,\nand spurred on all they might, while a half score of bowmen who had\ncome out of the thicket bent their bows and fell a-shooting. But now\nthe men of Utterbol spurred to meet the foe, and as Redhead cast his\nspear into the rest, he said to Ralph: \"Glad am I that thy Lady is\nanear to see me, for now I worship her.\"\n\nTherewith the two bands met, and whereas on neither side was the armour\nvery stout, some men of either band were hurt or slain at once with\nspearthrust; though, save for Ralph, they did not run straight on each\nother; but fenced and foined with their spears deftly enough.  As for\nRalph, he smote a tall man full on the breast and pierced him through\nand through, and then pulled out the Upmeads blade and smote on the\nright hand and the left, so that none came anigh him willingly.\n\nShortly to say it, in five minutes' time the Black Riders were fleeing\nall over the field with them of Utterbol at their heels, and the bowmen\nran back again into the wood.  But one of the foemen as he fled cast a\njavelin at a venture, and who should be before it save Ursula, so that\nshe reeled in her saddle, and would have fallen downright but for one\nof the Utterbol fellows who stayed her, and got her gently off her\nhorse.  This Ralph saw not, for he followed far in the chase, and was\ncoming back somewhat slowly along with Redhead, who was hurt, but not\nsorely.  So when he came up, and saw Ursula sitting on the grass with\nfour or five men about her, he sickened for fear; but she rose up and\ncame slowly and pale-faced to meet him, and said:  \"Fear not, beloved,\nfor steel kept out steel: I have no scratch or point or edge on me.\"\nSo therewith he kissed her, and embraced her, and was glad.\n\nThe Utterbol Riders had slain sixteen of their foemen; for they took\nnone to mercy, and four of their band were slain outright, and six\nhurt, but not grievously.  So they tarried awhile on the field of deed\nto rest them and tend their wounded men, and so rode on again heedfully.\n\nBut Redhead spake:  \"It is good to see thee tilting, King's Son.  I\ndoubt me I shall never learn thy downright thrust.  Dost thou remember\nhow sorry a job I made of it, when we met in the lists at Vale Turris\nthat other day?\"\n\n\"Yea, yea,\" said Ralph.  \"Thou were best let that flea stick on the\nwall.  For to-day, at least, I have seen thee play at sharps deftly\nenough.\"\n\nQuoth Redhead:  \"Lord, it is naught, a five minutes' scramble.  That\nwhich trieth a man, is to fight and overcome, and straight have to\nfight with fresh foemen, and yet again, till ye long for dark night to\ncover you--yea, or even death.\"\n\n\"Warrior-like and wisely thou speakest,\" said Ralph; \"and whoever thou\nservest thou shalt serve well.  And now once more I would it were me.\"\n\nRedhead shook his head at that word, and said:  \"I would it might be\nso; but it will not be so as now.\"\n\nForth on they rode, and slept in a wood that night, keeping good watch;\nbut saw no more of the Black Riders for that time.\n\nOn a day thereafter when it was nigh evening, Ralph looked about, and\nsaw a certain wood on the edge of a plain, and he stayed Ursula, and\nsaid: \"Look round about, beloved; for this is the very field whereas I\nwas betrayed into the hands of the men of Utterbol.\"  She smiled on him\nand said: \"Let me light down then, that I may kiss the earth of that\nkind field, where thou wert not stayed over long, but even long enough\nthat we might meet in the dark wood thereafter.\"\n\n\"Sweetling,\" said Ralph, \"this mayst thou do and grieve no man, not\neven for a little.  For lo you! the captain is staying the\nsumpter-beasts, and it is his mind, belike, that we shall sleep in\nyonder wood to-night.\" Therewith he lighted down and she in likewise:\nthen he took her by the hand and led her on a few yards, and said: \"Lo,\nbeloved, this quicken-tree; hereby it was that the tent was pitched\nwherein I lay the night when I was taken.\"\n\nShe looked on him shyly and said:  \"Wilt thou not sleep here once more\nto-night?\"\n\n\"Yea, well-beloved,\" said he, \"I will bid them pitch thy tent on this\nsame place, that I may smell the wild thyme again, as I did that other\nwhile.\"\n\nSo there on the field of his ancient grief they rested that night in\nall love and content.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nOf Goldburg Again, and the Queen Thereof\n\n\nNext day they went forth through the country wherethrough Morfinn had\nled Ralph into captivity; and Redhead rode warily; for there were many\npasses which looked doubtful:  but whether the ill men feared to meddle\nwith them, or however it were, none waylaid them, and they all came\nsafely to the gate of Goldburg, the towers whereof were full of folk\nlooking forth on them.  So they displayed their pennon, and rode into\nthe street, where folk pressed about them in friendly wise; for the new\nLord of Utterbol had made firm and fast peace with Goldburg.  So they\nrode to the hostel, and gat them victual, and rested in peace that\nnight.  But Ralph wondered whether the Queen would send for him when\nshe heard of his coming back again, and he hoped that she would let him\nbe; for he was ashamed when he thought of her love for him, and how\nthat he had clean forgotten her till he was close to Goldburg again.\n\nBut when morning was come Ralph spake to Redhead and asked him how he\nshould do to wage men for the homeward journey on thence; and Redhead\nsaid:  \"I have already seen the Clerk of the Porte, and he will be here\nin an hour with the license for thee to wage men to go with thee to\nCheaping Knowe.  As for me, I must needs go see the King, and give him\na letter sealed by my lord's hand; and when I come back from him, I\nwill go round to the alehouses which be haunted of the men-at-arms to\nsee after strong carles for thine avail.  But to the King hast thou no\nneed to go, save he send for thee, whereas thou art not come hither to\nchaffer, and he needeth not men of war.\"\n\nRalph stared at him and said:  \"The King, sayst thou? is there no Queen\nof Goldburg?\"  Said Redhead:  \"There is the King's wedded wife, but her\nthey call not Queen, but Lady.\" \"But the Queen that was,\" said Ralph,\n\"where is she then?\" \"Yea truly,\" said Redhead, \"a Queen sat alone as\nruler here a while ago; but whether she died, or what befell her, I\nknow nothing.  I had little to do with Goldburg till our lord conquered\nUtterbol.  Lo here the host! he may tell thee the tale thereof.\"\n\nTherewith he departed, and left Ralph with the host, whom Ralph\nquestioned of the story, for his heart was wrung lest such a fair woman\nand so friendly should have come to harm.\n\nSo the host sat down by Ralph and said:  \"My master, this is a tale\nwhich is grievous to us:  for though the saints forbid I should say a\nword against my lord that is now, nor is there any need to, yet we\ndeemed us happy to be under so dear a lady and so good and fair as she\nwas.  Well, she is gone so that we wot not whether she be living or\ndead.  For so it is that in the early spring, somewhat more than a year\nago that is, one morning when folk arose, the Queen's place was empty.\nRiding and running there was about and about, but none the more was she\nfound.  Forsooth as time wore, tales were told of what wise she left\nus, and why:  but she was gone.  Well, fair sir, many deemed that\nthough her lineage was known by seeming, yet she was of the fairy, and\nneeded neither steed nor chariot to go where she would.  But her women\nand those that knew her best, deemed that whatso she were, she had\nslain herself, as they thought, for some unhappiness of love.  For\nindeed she had long gone about sad and distraught, though she neither\nwept, nor would say one word of her sorrow, whatsoever it might be.\n\n\"But, fair sir, since thou art a stranger, and art presently departing\nfrom our city, I will tell thee a thing.  To wit; one month or so after\nshe had vanished away, I held talk with a certain old fisherman of our\nwater, and he told me that on that same night of her vanishing, as he\nstood on the water-side handing the hawser of his barque, and the sail\nwas all ready to be sheeted home, there came along the shore a woman\ngoing very swiftly, who, glancing about her, as if to see that there\nwas none looking on or prying, came up to him, and prayed him in a\nsweet voice for instant passage down the water.  Wrapped she was in a\ndark cloak and a cowl over her head, but as she put forth her hand to\ngive him gold, he saw even by the light of his lantern that it was\nexceeding fair, and that great gems flashed from the finger-rings, and\nthat there was a great gold ring most precious on her arm.\n\n\"He yeasaid her asking, partly because of her gold, partly (as he told\nme) that he feared her, deeming her to be of the fairy.  Then she\nstepped over his gangway of one board on to his boat, and as he held\nthe lantern low down to light her, lest she should make a false step\nand fall into the water, he noted (quoth he) that a golden shoe all\nbegemmed came out from under gown-hem and that the said hem was\nbroidered thickly with pearl and jewels.\n\n\"Small was his barque, and he alone with the woman, and there was a\nwind in the March night, and the stream is swift betwixt the quays of\nour city; so that by night and cloud they made much way down the water,\nand at sunrise were sailing through the great wood which lieth hence a\ntwenty leagues seaward.  So when the sun was risen she stood up in the\nfore part of the boat, and bade him turn the barque toward the shore,\nand even as the bows ran upon the sand, she leapt out and let the\nthicket cover her; nor have any of Goldburg seen her since, or the\nQueen.  But for my part I deem the woman to have been none other than\nthe Queen.  Seest thou then! she is gone: but the King Rainald her\ncousin reigns in her stead, a wise man, and a mighty, and no tyrant or\nskinner of the people.\"\n\nRalph heard and pondered, and was exceeding sorry, and more had he been\nbut for the joyousness which came of the Water of the Well.  Howbeit he\nmight not amend it:  for even were he to seek for the Queen and find\nher, it might well be worse than letting it be.  For he knew (when he\nthought of her) that she loved him, and how would it be if she might\nnot outwear her love, or endure the days of Goldburg, and he far away?\nThis he said to himself, which he might not have said to any other soul.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nThey Come to Cheaping Knowe Once More.  Of the King Thereof\n\n\nToward evening comes Redhead, and tells Ralph how he hired him a dozen\nmen-at-arms to follow him well-weaponed to Cheaping Knowe: withal he\ncounselled him to take a good gift with him to that same town to buy\nthe good will of the King there; who was a close-fist and a cruel lord.\n\nAfterwards they sat together in the court of that fair house before\ngood wine, Ralph and Ursula, and Redhead and the Sage of Swevenham, and\nspake of many things, and were merry and kind together.  But on the\nmorrow Redhead departed from Goldburg with his men, and he loth to\ndepart, and they gave him farewell lovingly.  Thereafter Ralph's new\nmen came to him in the hostelry, and he feasted them and did well to\nthem, so that they praised him much.  Then he gat him victuals and\nsumpter-horses for the journey, and bought good store of bows and\narrows withal.  Furthermore he took heed to Redhead's word and bought a\ngoodly gift of silver vessel and fine cloth for the King of Cheaping\nKnowe.\n\nThe day after he and his company departed from Goldburg toward the\nmountains, which they passed unfought and unwaylaid: partly because\nthey were a band of stout men, and partly because a little before there\nhad been a great overthrow of the wild men of those mountains at the\nhands of the men of Goldburg and the Chapmen; so that now the\nmountain-men lay close, and troubled none that rode with any force.\n\nOn the way they failed not to pass by the place where they had erst\nfound Bull Nosy slain:  there they saw his howe, heaped up exceeding\nhigh, covered in with earth, whereon the grass was now beginning to\ngrow, and with a great standing stone on the top thereof, whereon was\ngraven the image of a bull, with a sword thereunder; whereby the\nwayfarers wotted that this had been done in his memory by his brother,\nthe new Lord of Utterbol.\n\nSo they came down out of the mountains to Whiteness, where they had\ngood entertainment, but tarried not save for one night, riding their\nways betimes to Cheaping Knowe: and they came before the gate thereof\nsafe and sound on the third day; and slept in the hostelry of the\nchapmen.  On the morrow Ralph went up to the King's Castle with but\nthree men unweaponed bearing the gift which he had got for the King.\nAlbeit he sent not away his men-at-arms till he should know how the\nKing was minded towards him.\n\nAs he went he saw in the streets sad tokens of the lord's cruel\njustice, as handless men, fettered, dragging themselves about, and folk\nhung up before chapmen's booths, and whipping-cheer, and the pillar,\nand such like.  But whereas he might not help he would not heed, but\ncame right to the Castle-gate, and entered easily when he had told his\nerrand, for gift-bearing men are not oftenest withstood.\n\nHe was brought straightway into the great hall, where sat the King on\nhis throne amidst the chiefs of the Porte, and his captains and\nsergeants, who were, so to say, his barons, though they were not barons\nof lineage, but masterful men who were wise to do his bidding.\n\nAs he went up the hall he saw a sort of poor caytiffs, women as well as\nmen, led away from the high-place in chains by bailiffs and tipstaves;\nand he doubted not that these were for torments or maiming and death;\nand thought it were well might he do them some good.\n\nBeing come to the King, he made his obeisance to him, and craved his\ngood will and leave to wage men-at-arms to bring him through the\nmountains.\n\nThe King was a tall man, a proper man of war; long-legged, black\nbearded, and fierce-eyed. Some word he had heard of Ralph's gift,\ntherefore he was gracious to him; he spake and said:  \"Thou hast come\nacross the mountains a long way, fair Sir; prithee on what errand?\"\nAnswered Ralph:  \"For no errand, lord, save to fare home to mine own\nland.\" \"Where is thine own land?\" said the King, stretching out his\nlegs and lying back in his chair.  \"West-away, lord, many a mile,\" said\nRalph.  \"Yea,\" quoth the King, \"and how far didst thou go beyond the\nmountains?  As far as Utterbol?\"  Said Ralph:  \"Yet further, but not to\nUtterbol.\" \"Hah!\" said the King, \"who goeth beyond Utterbol must have a\ngreat errand; what was thine?\"\n\nRalph thought for a moment, and deemed it best to say as little as he\nmight concerning Ursula; so he answered, and his voice grew loud and\nbold: \"I was minded to drink a draught of the WELL at the WORLD'S END,\nand even so I did.\"  As he spake, he drew himself up, and his brows\nwere knit a little, but his eyes sparkled from under them, and his\ncheeks were bright and rosy.  He half drew the sword from the scabbard,\nand sent it back rattling, so that the sound of it went about the hall;\nhe upreared his head and looked around him on this and that one of the\nwarriors of the aliens, and he sniffed the air into his nostrils as he\nstood alone amongst them, and set his foot down hard on the floor of\nthe King's hall, and his armour rattled upon him.\n\nBut the King sat bolt upright in his chair and stared Ralph's face; and\nthe warriors and lords and merchants fell back from Ralph and stood in\nan ordered rank on either side of him and bent their heads before him.\nNone spoke till the King said in a hoarse voice, but lowly and\nwheedling: \"Tell us, fair Sir, what is it that we can do to pleasure\nthee?\"\n\n\"King,\" said Ralph, \"I am not here to take gifts but to give them\nrather: yet since thou biddest me I will crave somewhat of thee, that\nthou mayst be the more content:  and moreover the giving shall cost\nthee nothing: I crave of thee to give me life and limb and freedom for\nthe poor folk whom I saw led down the hall by thy tipstaves, even now.\nGive me that or nothing.\"  The King scowled, but he spake: \"This is\nindeed a little gift of thee to take; yet to none else save thee had I\ngiven it.\"\n\nTherewith he spake to a man beside him and said:  \"Go thou, set them\nfree, and if any hurt hath befallen them thy life shall answer for it.\nIs it enough, fair Sir, and have we thy goodwill?\" Ralph laughed for\njoy of his life and his might, and he answered: \"King, this is the\ntoken of my goodwill; fear naught of me.\" And he turned to his men, and\nbade them bright forth the gift of Goldburg and open it before the\nKing; and they did so.  But when the King cast eyes on the wares his\nface was gladdened, for he was a greedy wolf, and whoso had been close\nto his mouth would have heard him mutter:  \"So mighty! yet so wealthy!\"\nBut he thanked Ralph aloud and in smooth words.  And Ralph made\nobeisance to him again, and then turned and went his ways down the\nhall, and was glad at heart that he had become so mighty a man, for all\nfell back before him and looked on him with worship.  Howbeit he had\nlooked on the King closely and wisely, and deemed that he was both\ncruel and guileful, so that he rejoiced that he had spoken naught of\nUrsula, and he was minded to keep her within gates all the while they\nabode at Cheaping-Knowe.\n\nWhen he came to the hostel he called his men-at-arms together and asked\nthem how far they would follow him, and with one voice they said all\nthat they would go with him whereso he would, so that it were not\nbeyond reason.  So they arrayed them for departure on the morrow, and\nwere to ride out of gates about mid-morning. So wore the day to\nevening; but ere the night was old came a man asking for Ralph, as one\nwho would have a special alms of him, a poor man by seeming, and evilly\nclad.  But when Ralph was alone with him, the poor man did him to wit\nthat for all his seeming wretchedness he was but disguised, and was in\nsooth a man of worship, and one of the Porte.  Quoth he: \"I am of the\nKing's Council, and I must needs tell thee a thing of the King: that\nthough he was at the first overawed and cowed by the majesty of thee, a\nFriend of the Well, he presently came to himself, which was but ill; so\nthat what for greed, what for fear even, he is minded to send men to\nwaylay thee, some three leagues from the town, on your way to the\nmountains, but ye shall easily escape his gin now I have had speech of\nthee; for ye may take a by-road and fetch a compass of some twelve\nmiles, and get aback of the waylayers.  Yet if ye escape this first\nambush, unless ye are timely in riding early tomorrow it is not unlike\nthat he shall send swift riders to catch up with you ere ye come to the\nmountains.  Now I am come to warn thee hereof, partly because I would\nnot have so fair a life spilt, which should yet do so well for the sons\nof Adam, and partly also because I would have a reward of thee for my\nwarning and my wayleading, for I shall show thee the way and the road.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Ask and fear not; for if I may trust thee I already owe\nthee a reward.\"  \"My name is Michael-a-dale,\" said the man, \"and from\nSwevenham I came hither, and fain would I go thither, and little hope I\nhave thereof save I go privily in some such band as thine, whereas the\ntyrant holdeth me on pain, as well I know, of an evil death.\"\n\n\"I grant thine asking, friend,\" said Ralph; \"and now thou wert best go\nto thine house and truss what stuff thou mayst have with thee and come\nback hither in the grey of the morning.\"\n\nThe man shook his head and said:  \"Nay; here must I bide night-long,\nand go out of gates amongst thy men-at-arms, and clad like one of them\nwith iron enough about me to hide the fashion of me; it were nowise\nsafe for me to go back into the town; for this tyrant wages many a spy:\nyea, forsooth, I fear me by certain tokens that it is not all so\ncertain that I have not been spied upon already, and that it is known\nthat I have come to thee.  And I will tell thee that by hook or by\ncrook the King already knoweth somewhat of thee and of the woman who is\nin thy company.\"\n\nRalph flushed red at that word, and felt his heart bound: but even\ntherewith came into them the Sage; and straightway Ralph took him apart\nand told him on what errand the man was come, and ask him if he deemed\nhim trusty.  Then the Sage went up to Michael and looked him hard in\nthe face awhile, and then said: \"Yea, honest he is unless the kindred\nof Michael of the Hatch of Swevenham have turned thieves in the third\ngeneration.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Michael, \"and dost thou know the Hatch?\"\n\n\"As I know mine own fingers,\" said the Sage; \"and even so I knew it\nyears and years before thou wert born.\"  Therewith he told the\nnew-comer what he was, and the two men of Swevenham made joy of each\nother.  And Ralph was fain of them, and went into the chamber wherein\nsat Ursula, and told her how all things were going, and she said that\nshe would be naught but glad to leave that town, which seemed to her\nlike to Utterbol over again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nAn Adventure on the Way to the Mountains\n\n\nOn the morrow Ralph got his men together betimes and rode out a-gates,\nand was little afraid that any should meddle with him within the town\nor anigh it, and even so it turned out.  But Michael rode in the\ncompany new clad, and with his head and face all hidden in a wide\nsallet.  As for Ralph and Ursula, they were exceeding glad, and now\nthat their heads were turned to the last great mountains, it seemed to\nthem that they were verily going home, and they longed for the night,\nthat they might be alone together, and talk of all these matters in\neach others' arms.\n\nWhen they were out a-gates, they rode for two miles along the highway,\nheedlessly enough by seeming, and then, as Michael bade, turned\nsuddenly into a deep and narrow lane, and forth on, as it led betwixt\nhazelled banks and coppices of small wood, skirting the side of the\nhills, so that it was late in the afternoon before they came into the\nHighway again, which was the only road leading into the passes of the\nmountains.  Then said Michael that now by all likelihood they had\nbeguiled the waylayers for that time; so they went on merrily till half\nthe night was worn, when they shifted for lodging in a little oak-wood\nby the wayside.  There they lay not long, but were afoot betimes in the\nmorning, and rode swiftly daylong, and lay down at night on the wayside\nwith the less dread because they were come so far without hurt.\n\nBut on the third day, somewhat after noon, when they were come up above\nthe tilled upland and the land was rough and the ways steep, there lay\nbefore them a dark wood swallowing up the road.  Thereabout Ralph\ndeemed that he saw weapons glittering ahead, but was not sure, for as\nclear-sighted as he was.  So he stayed his band, and had Ursula into\nthe rearward, and bade all men look to their weapons, and then they\nwent forward heedfully and in good order, and presently not only Ralph,\nbut all of them could see men standing in the jaws of the pass with the\nwood on either side of them, and though at first they doubted if these\nwere aught but mere strong-thieves, such as any wayfarers might come\non, they had gone but a little further when Michael knew them for the\nriders of Cheaping Knowe.  \"Yea,\" said the Sage of Swevenham, \"it is\nclear how it has been: when they found that we came not that first\nmorning, they had an inkling of what had befallen, and went forward\ntoward the mountains, and not back to Cheaping Knowe, and thus outwent\nus while we were fetching that compass to give them the go-by:\nwherefore I deem that some great man is with them, else had they gone\nback to town for new orders.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ralph, \"then will they be too many for us; so now will I\nride ahead and see if we may have peace.\" Said the Sage, \"Yea, but be\nwary, for thou hast to do with the guileful.\"\n\nThen Ralph rode on alone till he was come within hail of those\nwaylayers.  Then he thrust his sword into the sheath, and cried out:\n\"Will any of the warriors in the wood speak with me; for I am the\ncaptain of the wayfarers?\"\n\nThen rode out from those men a very tall man, and two with him, one on\neither side, and he threw back the sallet from his face, and said:\n\"Wayfarer, all we have weapons in our hands, and we so many that thou\nand thine will be in regard of us as the pips to the apple.  Wherefore,\nyield ye!\"  Quoth Ralph:  \"Unto whom then shall I yield me?\" Said the\nother:  \"To the men of the King of Cheaping Knowe.\" Then spake Ralph:\n\"What will ye do with us when we are yolden?  Shall we not pay ransom\nand go our ways?\"  \"Yea,\" said the tall man, \"and this is the ransom:\nthat ye give up into my hands my dastard who hath bewrayed me, and the\nwoman who wendeth in your company.\"\n\nRalph laughed; for by this time he knew the voice of the King, yea, and\nthe face of him under his sallet.  So he cried back in answer, and in\nsuch wise as if the words came rather from his luck than from his\nyouth:  \"Ho, Sir King!  beware beware! lest thou tremble when thou\nseest the bare blade of the Friend of the Well more than thou\ntrembledst erst, when the blade was hidden in the sheath before the\nthrone of thine hall.\"\n\nBut the King cried out in a loud harsh voice.  \"Thou, young man, beware\nthou! and try not thy luck overmuch.  We are as many as these trees,\nand thou canst not prevail over us.  Go thy ways free, and leave me\nwhat thou canst not help leaving.\"\n\n\"Yea, fool,\" cried Ralph, \"and what wilt thou do with these two?\"\n\nSaid the King:  \"The traitor I will flay, and the woman I will bed.\"\n\nScarce were the words out of his mouth ere Ralph gave forth a great cry\nand drew his sword, set spurs to his horse, and gallopped on up the\nroad with all his band at his back for they had drawn anigh amidst this\ntalk.  But or ever they came on the foemen, they heard a great confused\ncry of onset mingled with affright, and lo! the King threw up his arms,\nand fell forward on his horse's neck with a great arrow through his\nthroat.\n\nRalph drave on sword in hand, crying out, \"Home, home to Upmeads!\" and\nanon was amidst of the foe smiting on either hand.  His men followed,\nshouting:  \"Ho, for the Friend of the Well!\" And amongst the foemen,\nwho were indeed very many, was huge dismay, so that they made but a\nsorry defence before the band of the wayfarers, who knew not what to\nmake of it, till they noted that arrows and casting-spears were coming\nout of the wood on either side, which smote none of them, but many of\nthe foemen.  Short was the tale, for in a few minutes there were no men\nof the foe together save those that were fleeing down the road to\nCheaping Knowe.\n\nRalph would not suffer his men to follow the chase, for he wotted not\nwith whom he might have to deal besides the King's men.  He drew his\nmen together and looked round for Ursula, and saw that the Sage had\nbrought her up anigh him, and there she sat a-horseback, pale and\npanting with the fear of death and joy of deliverance.\n\nNow Ralph cried out from his saddle in a loud voice, and said: \"Ho ye\nof the arrows of the wood! ye have saved me from my foemen; where be\nye, and what be ye?\"  Came a loud voice from out of the wood on the\nright hand:  \"Children, tell the warrior whose sons ye be!\" Straightway\nbrake out a huge bellowing on either side of the road, as though the\nwood were all full of great neat.\n\nThen cried out Ralph:  \"If ye be of the kindred of the Bull, ye will\nbelike be my friends rather than my foes.  Or have ye heard tell of\nRalph of Upmeads?  Now let your captain come forth and speak with me.\"\n\nScarce were the words out of his mouth ere a man came leaping forth\nfrom out the wood, and stood before Ralph in the twilight of the\nboughs, and Ralph noted of him that he was clad pretty much like to\nBull Shockhead of past time, save that he had a great bull's head for a\nhelm (which afterwards Ralph found out was of iron and leather) and a\ngreat gold ring on his arm.\n\nThen Ralph thrust his sword back into the sheath, and his folk handled\ntheir weapons peaceably, while Ralph hailed the new-comer as Lord or\nDuke of the Bulls.\n\n\"Belike,\" quoth the said chieftain, \"thou wouldst wish to show me some\ntoken, whereby we may wot that thou art that Friend of the Well and of\nour kinsman concerning whom he sent us a message.\"\n\nThen Ralph bethought him of the pouch with the knot of grass therein\nwhich Bull Shockhead had given him at Goldburg; so he drew it out, and\ngave it into the hand of the chieftain, who no sooner caught a glimpse\nthereof than he said: \"Verily our brother's hand hath met thine when he\ngave thee this.  Yet forsooth, now that I look on thee, I may say that\nscarce did I need token to tell me that thou wert the very man.  For I\ncan see thee, that thou art of great honour and worship, and thou didst\nride boldly against the foemen when thou knewest not that we had\nwaylaid thy waylayers.  Now I wot that there is no need to ask thee\nwhether thou wouldst get thee out of our mountains by the shortest\nroad, yet wilt thou make it little longer, and somewhat safer, if ye\nwill suffer us to lead thee by way of our dwelling.\" So Ralph yeasaid\nhis bidding without more words.\n\nAs they spake thus together the road both above and below was become\nblack with weaponed men, and some of Ralph's band looked on one\nanother, as though they doubted their new friends somewhat.  But the\nSage of Swevenham spoke to them and bade them fear nought.  \"For,\" said\nhe, \"so far as we go, who are now their friends, there is no guile in\nthese men.\"  The Bull captain heard him and said: \"Thou sayest sooth,\nold man; and I shall tell thee that scarce had a band like thine come\nsafe through the mountains, save by great good luck, without the leave\nof us; for the fool with the crown that lieth there dead had of late\ndays so stirred up the Folks of the Fells through his grimness and\ncruelty that we have been minded to stop everything bigger than a\ncur-dog that might seek to pass by us, for at least so long as yonder\nrascal should live.  But ye be welcome; so now let us to the road, for\nthe day weareth.\"\n\nSo the tribesmen gat them into order, and their Duke went on the left\nside of Ralph, while Ursula rode on his right hand.  The Duke and all\nhis men were afoot, but they went easily and swiftly, as wolves trot.\nAs for the slain of the waylayers, of whom there were some threescore,\nthe Bull captain would do nought but let them lie on the road.  \"For,\"\nsaid he, \"there be wolves and lynxes enough in the wood, and the ravens\nof the uplands, and the kites shall soon scent the carrion.  They shall\nhave burial soon enough.  Neither will we meddle with it; nay, not so\nmuch as to hang the felon King's head at thy saddle-bow, lord.\"\n\nBy sunset they were out of the wood and on the side of a rough fell, so\nthey went no further, but lighted fires at the edge of the thicket, and\nmade merry round about them, singing their songs concerning the deeds\nof their folk, and jesting withal, but not foully; and they roasted\nvenison of hart and hind at the fires, and they had with them wine, the\nmore part whereof they had found in the slain King's carriages, and\nthey made great feast to the wayfarers, and were exceeding fain of\nthem; after their fashion, whereas if a man were their friend he could\nscarce be enough their friend, and if he were their foe, they could\nnever be fierce enough with him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nThey Come Through the Mountains Into the Plain\n\n\nOn the morrow early they all fared on together, and thereafter they\nwent for two days more till they came into a valley amidst of the\nmountains which was fair and lovely, and therein was the dwelling or\ntown of this Folk of the Fells.  It was indeed no stronghold, save that\nit was not easy to find, and that the way thither was well defensible\nwere foemen to try it.  The houses thereof were artless, the chiefest\nof them like to the great barn of an abbey in our land, the others low\nand small; but the people, both men and women, haunted mostly the big\nhouse.  As for the folk, they were for the more part like those whom\nthey had met afore: strong men, but not high of stature, black-haired,\nwith blue or grey eyes, cheerful of countenance, and of many words.\nTheir women were mostly somewhat more than comely, smiling, kind of\nspeech, but not suffering the caresses of aliens.  They saw no thralls\namongst them; and when Ralph asked hereof, how that might be, since\nthey were men-catchers, they told him that when they took men and\nwomen, as oft they did, they always sold them for what they would bring\nto the plain-dwellers; or else slew them, or held them to ransom, but\nnever brought them home to their stead.  Howbeit, when they took\nchildren, as whiles befell, they sometimes brought them home, and made\nthem very children of their Folk with many uncouth prayers and worship\nof their Gods, who were indeed, as they deemed, but forefathers of the\nFolk.\n\nNow Ralph, he and his, being known for friends, these wild men could\nnot make enough of them, and as it were, compelled them to abide there\nthree days, feasting them, and making them all the cheer they might.\nAnd they showed the wayfarers their manner of hunting, both of the hart\nand the boar, and of wild bulls also.  At first Ralph somewhat loathed\nall this (though he kept a pleasant countenance toward his host), for\nsorely he desired the fields of Upmeads and his father's house.  But at\nlast when the hunt was up in the mountains, and especially of the wild\nbulls, the heart and the might in him so arose that he enforced himself\nto do well, and the wild men wondered at his prowess, whereas he was\nuntried in this manner of sports, and they deemed him one of the Gods,\nand said that their kinsman had done well to get him so good a friend.\nBoth Ursula and the Sage withheld them from this hunting, and Ursula\nabode with the women, who told her much of their ways of life, and\nstories of old time; frank and free they were, and loved her much, and\nshe was fain of such manly-minded women after the sleight and lies of\nthe poor thralls of Utterbol.\n\nOn the fourth day the wayfarers made them ready and departed; and the\nchief of the Folk went with them with a chosen band of weaponed men,\npartly for the love of his guests, and partly that he might see the\nGoldburg men-at-arms safe back to the road unto the plain and the\nMidhouse of the Mountains, for they went now by other ways, which\nmissed the said House.  On this journey naught befell to tell of, and\nthey all came down safe into the plain.\n\nThere the Goldburg men took their wage, and bidding farewell, turned\nback with the wild men, praising Ralph much for his frankness and open\nhand.  As for the wild men, they exceeded in their sorrow for the\nparting, and many of them wept and howled as though they had seen him\ndie before their faces.  But all that came to an end, and presently\ntheir cheer was amended, and their merry speech and laughter came down\nfrom the pass unto the wayfarers' ears as each band rode its way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nThe Roads Sunder Again\n\n\nRalph and Ursula, with the Sage and Michael-a-dale went their ways, and\nall was smooth with them, and they saw but few folk, and those mild and\nlowly.  At last, of an afternoon, they saw before them afar off the\ntowers and pinnacles of Whitwall, and Ralph's heart rose within him, so\nthat he scarce knew how to contain himself; but Ursula was shy and\nsilent, and her colour came and went, as though some fear had hold of\nher.  Now they two were riding on somewhat ahead of the others, so\nRalph turned to Ursula, and asked what ailed her.  She smiled on him\nand said: \"A simple sickness.  I am drawing nigh to thy home, and I am\nashamed.  Beyond the mountains, who knew what and whence I was?  I was\nfair, and for a woman not unvaliant, and that was enough.  But now when\nI am coming amongst the baronages and the lineages, what shall I do to\nhold up my head before the fools and the dastards of these high\nkindreds?  And that all the more, my knight, because thou art changed\nsince yester-year, and since we met on the want-way of the Wood\nPerilous, when I bade thee remember that thou wert a King's son and I a\nyeoman's daughter; for then thou wert but a lad, high-born and\nbeautiful, but simple maybe, and untried; whereas now thou art meet to\nsit in the Kaiser's throne and rule the world from the Holy City.\"\n\nHe laughed gaily and said:  \"What! is it all so soon forgotten, our\ndeeds beyond the Mountains?  Belike because we had no minstrel to rhyme\nit for us.  Or is it all but a dream? and has the last pass of the\nmountains changed all that for us?  What then! hast thou never become\nmy beloved, nor lain in one bed with me?  Thou whom I looked to deliver\nfrom the shame and the torment of Utterbol, never didst thou free\nthyself without my helping, and meet me in the dark wood, and lead me\nto the Sage who rideth yonder behind us!  No, nor didst thou ride\nfearless with me, leaving the world behind; nor didst thou comfort me\nwhen my heart went nigh to breaking in the wilderness!  Nor thee did I\ndeliver as I saw thee running naked from the jaws of death.  Nor were\nwe wedded in the wilderness far from our own folk.  Nor didst thou\ndeliver me from the venom of the Dry Tree.  Yea verily, nor did we\ndrink together of the Water of the Well!  It is all but tales of\nSwevenham, a blue vapour hanging on the mountains yonder!  So be it\nthen!  And here we ride together, deedless, a man and a maid of whom no\ntale may be told.  What next then, and who shall sunder us?\"\n\nTherewith he drew his sword from the sheath, and tossed it into the\nair, and caught it by the hilts as it came down, and he cried out:\n\"Hearken, Ursula!  By my sword I swear it, that when I come home to the\nlittle land, if my father and my mother and all my kindred fall not\ndown before thee and worship thee, then will I be a man without\nkindred, and I will turn my back on the land I love, and the House\nwherein I was born, and will win for thee and me a new kindred that all\nthe world shall tell of.  So help me Saint Nicholas, and all Hallows,\nand the Mother of God!\"\n\nShe looked on him with exceeding love, and said:  \"Ah, beloved, how\nfair thou art!  Is it not as I said, yea, and more, that now lieth the\nworld at thy feet, if thou wilt stoop to pick it up?  Believe me,\nsweet, all folk shall see this as I see it, and shall judge betwixt\nthee and me, and deem me naught.\"\n\n\"Beloved,\" he said, \"thou dost not wholly know thyself; and I deem that\nthe mirrors of steel serve thee but ill; and now must thou have\nsomewhat else for a mirror, to wit, the uprising and increase of\ntrouble concerning thee and thy fairness, and the strife of them that\nlove thee overmuch, who shall strive to take thee from me; and then the\nblade that hath seen the Well at the World's End shall come out of his\nsheath and take me and thee from the hubbub, and into the quiet fields\nof my father's home, and then shalt thou be learned of thyself, when\nthou seest that thou art the desire of all hearts.\"\n\n\"Ah, the wisdom of thee,\" she said, \"and thy valiancy, and I am become\nfeeble and foolish before thee!  What shall I do then?\"\n\nHe said:  \"Many a time shall it be shown what thou shalt do; but here\nand now is the highway dry and long, and the plain meads and acres on\neither hand, and a glimmer of Whitwall afar off, and the little cloud\nof dust about us two in the late spring weather; and the Sage and\nMichael riding behind us, and smiting dust from the hard road.  And now\nif this also be a dream, let it speedily begone, and let us wake up in\nthe ancient House at Upmeads, which thou hast never seen--and thou and\nI in each other's arms.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nThey Come to Whitwall Again\n\n\nHerewith they were come to a little thorp where the way sundered, for\nthe highway went on to Whitwall, and a byway turned off to Swevenham.\nThereby was a poor hostel, where they stayed and rested for the night,\nbecause evening was at hand.  So when those four had eaten and drunk\nthere together, Ralph spoke and said:  \"Michael-a-dale, thou art for\nSwevenham to-morrow?\" \"Yea, lord,\" said Michael, \"belike I shall yet\nfind kindred there; and I call to thy mind that I craved of thee to\nlead me to Swevenham as payment for all if I had done aught for thy\nservice.\"\n\n\"Sooth is that,\" said Ralph, \"thou shalt go with my good-will; and, as\nI deem, thou shalt not lack company betwixt here and Swevenham, whereas\nour dear friend here, the friend of thy father's father, is going the\nsame road.\"\n\nThen the Sage of Swevenham leaned across the board, and said: \"What\nword hath come out of thy mouth, my son?\"  Said Ralph, smiling on him:\n\"It is the last word which we have heard from thee of this matter,\nthough verily it was spoken a while ago.  What wilt thou add to it as\nnow?\"  \"This,\" quoth the Sage, \"that I will leave thee no more till\nthou biddest me go from thee.  Was this word needful?\"\n\nRalph reached his hand to him and said:  \"It is well and more; but the\nroad hence to Upmeads may yet be a rough one.\" \"Yea,\" said the Sage,\n\"yet shall we come thither all living, unless my sight now faileth.\"\n\nThen Ursula rose up and came to the old man, and cast her arms about\nhim and said:  \"Yea, father, come with us, and let thy wisdom bless our\nroof-tree.  Wilt thou not teach our children wisdom; yea, maybe our\nchildren's children, since thou art a friend of the Well?\"\n\n\"I know not of the teaching of wisdom,\" said the Sage; \"but as to my\ngoing with thee, it shall be as I said e'en-now; and forsooth I looked\nfor this bidding of thee to make naught of the word which I spoke ere\nyet I had learned wisdom of thee.\"\n\nTherewith were they merry, and fain of each other, and the evening wore\namidst great content.\n\nBut when morning was come they gat to horse, and Ralph spake to Michael\nand said:  \"Well, friend, now must thou ride alone to thy kindred, and\nmay fair days befall thee in Swevenham.  But if thou deem at any time\nthat matters go not so well with thee as thou wouldst, then turn thine\nhead to Upmeads, and try it there, and we shall further thee all we\nmay.\"\n\nThen came the Sage to Michael as he sat upon his horse, a stalwarth man\nof some forty winters, and said:  \"Michael-a-dale, reach me thine\nhand.\" So did he, and the Sage looked into the palm thereof, and said:\n\"This man shall make old bones, and it is more like than not, King's\nson, that he shall seek to thee at Upmeads ere he die.\" Said Ralph:\n\"His coming shall be a joy to us, how pleasant soever our life may be\notherwise.  Farewell, Michael! all good go with thee for thine\nwholesome redes.\"\n\nSo then Michael gave them farewell, and rode his ways to Swevenham,\ngoing hastily, as one who should hurry away from a grief.\n\nBut the three held on their way to Whitwall, and it was barely noon\nwhen they came to the gate thereof on a Saturday of latter May, It was\na market-day, and the streets were thronged, and they looked on the\nfolk and were fain of them, since they seemed to them to be something\nmore than aliens.  The folk also looked on them curiously, and deemed\nthem goodly, both the old man and the two knights, for they thought no\notherwise of Ursula than that she was a carle.\n\nBut now as they rode, slowly because of the crowd, up Petergate, they\nheard a cry of one beside them, as of a man astonished but joyful; so\nRalph drew rein, and turned thither whence the cry came, and Ursula saw\na man wide-shouldered, grey-haired, blue-eyed, and ruddy of\ncountenance--a man warrior-like to look on, and girt with a long sword.\nRalph lighted down from his horse, and met the man, who was coming\ntoward him, cast his arms about his neck, and kissed him, and lo, it\nwas Richard the Red.  The people round about, when they saw it, clapped\ntheir hands, and crowded about the two crying out:  \"Hail to the\nfriends long parted, and now united!\"  But Richard, whom most knew,\ncried out:  \"Make way, my masters! will ye sunder us again?\" Then he\nsaid to Ralph:  \"Get into thy saddle, lad; for surely thou hast a tale\nto tell overlong for the open street.\"\n\nRalph did as he was bidden, and without more ado they went on all\ntoward that hostelry where Ralph had erst borne the burden of grief.\nRichard walked by Ralph's side, and as he went he said: \"Moreover, lad,\nI can see that thy tale is no ill one; therefore my heart is not wrung\nfor thee or me, though I wait for it a while.\" Then again he said:\n\"Thou doest well to hide her loveliness in war-weed even in this town\nof peace.\"\n\nUrsula reddened, and Richard laughed and said: \"Well, it is a fair rose\nwhich thou hast brought from east-away.  There will be never another\ncouple in these parts like you.  Now I see the words on thy lips; so I\ntell thee that Blaise thy brother is alive and well and happy; which\nlast word means that his coffer is both deep and full.  Forsooth, he\nwould make a poor bargain in buying any kingship that I wot of, so rich\nhe is, yea, and mighty withal.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"And how went the war with Walter the Black?\"\n\nEven as he spake his face changed, for he bethought him over closely of\nthe past days, and his dream of the Lady of Abundance and of Dorothea,\nwho rode by him now as Ursula.  But Richard spake:  \"Short is the tale\nto tell.  I slew him in shock of battle, and his men craved peace of\nthe good town.  Many were glad of his death, and few sorrowed for it;\nfor, fair as his young body was, he was a cruel tyrant.\"\n\nTherewith were they come to the hostel of the Lamb which was the very\nsame house wherein Ralph had abided aforetime; and as he entered it, it\nis not to be said but that inwardly his heart bled for the old sorrow.\nUrsula looked on him lovingly and blithely; and when they were within\ndoors Richard turned to the Sage and said:  \"Hail to thee, reverend\nman!  wert thou forty years older to behold, outworn and forgotten of\ndeath, I should have said that thou wert like to the Sage that dwelt\nalone amidst the mountains nigh to Swevenham when I was a little lad,\nand fearsome was the sight of thee unto me.\"\n\nThe Sage laughed and said:  \"Yea, somewhat like am I yet to myself of\nforty years ago.  Good is thy memory, greybeard.\"\n\nThen Richard shook his head, and spake under his breath: \"Yea, then it\nwas no dream or coloured cloud, and he hath drank of the waters, and so\nthen hath my dear lord.\" Then he looked up bright-faced, and called on\nthe serving-men, and bade one lead them into a fair chamber, and\nanother go forth and provide a banquet to be brought in thither.  So\nthey went up into a goodly chamber high aloft; and Ursula went forth\nfrom it awhile, and came back presently clad in very fair woman's\nraiment, which Ralph had bought for her at Goldburg.  Richard looked on\nher and nothing else for a while; then he walked about the chamber\nuneasily, now speaking with the Sage, now with Ursula, but never with\nRalph.  At last he spake to Ursula, and said:  \"Grant me a grace, lady,\nand be not wroth if I take thy man into the window yonder that I may\ntalk with him privily while ye hold converse together, thou and the\nSage of Swevenham.\"\n\nShe laughed merrily and said:  \"Sir nurse, take thy bantling and cosset\nhim in whatso corner thou wilt, and I will turn away mine eyes from thy\ncaresses.\"\n\nSo Richard took Ralph into a window, and sat down beside him and said:\n\"Mayhappen I shall sadden thee by my question, but I mind me what our\nlast talking together was about, and therefore I must needs ask thee\nthis, was that other one fairer than this one is?\"\n\nRalph knit his brows:  \"I wot not,\" quoth he, \"since she is gone, that\nother one.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Richard, \"but this I say, that she is without a blemish.\nDid ye drink of the Well together?\"\n\n\"Yea, surely,\" said Ralph.  Said Richard:  \"And is this woman of a good\nheart?  Is she valiant?\"  \"Yea, yea,\" said Ralph, flushing red.\n\n\"As valiant as was that other?\" said Richard.  Said Ralph: \"How may I\ntell, unless they were tried in one way?\" Yet Richard spake:  \"Are ye\nwedded?\"  \"Even so,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Dost thou deem her true?\" said Richard.  \"Truer than myself,\" said\nRalph, in a voice which was somewhat angry.\n\nQuoth Richard:  \"Then is it better than well, and better than well; for\nnow hast thou wedded into the World of living men, and not to a dream\nof the Land of Fairy.\"\n\nRalph sat silent a little, and as if he were swallowing somewhat; at\nlast he said:  \"Old friend, I were well content if thou wert to speak\nsuch words no more; for it irks me, and woundeth my heart.\"\n\nSaid Richard:  \"Well, I will say no more thereof; be content therefore,\nfor now I have said it, and thou needest not fear me, what I have to\nsay thereon any more, and thou mayst well wot that I must needs have\nsaid somewhat of this.\"\n\nRalph nodded to him friendly, and even therewith came in the banquet,\nwhich was richly served, as for a King's son, and wine was poured forth\nof the best, and they feasted and were merry.  And then Ralph told all\nthe tale of his wanderings how it had betid, bringing in all that\nUrsula had told him of Utterbol; while as for her she put in no word of\nit.  So that at last Ralph, being wishful to hear her tell somewhat,\nmade more of some things than was really in them, so that she might set\nhim right; but no word more she said for all that, but only smiled on\nhim now and again, and sat blushing like a rose over her\ngolden-flowered gown, while Richard looked on her and praised her in\nhis heart exceedingly.\n\nBut when Ralph had done the story (which was long, so that by then it\nwas over it had been dark night some while), Richard said: \"Well,\nfosterling, thou hast seen much, and done much, and many would say that\nthou art a lucky man, and that more and much more lieth ready to thine\nhand.  Whither now wilt thou wend, or what wilt thou do?\"\n\nRalph's face reddened, as its wont had been when it was two years\nyounger, at contention drawing nigh, and he answered: \"Where then\nshould I go save to the House of my Fathers, and the fields that fed\nthem?  What should I do but live amongst my people, warding them from\nevil, and loving them and giving them good counsel?  For wherefore\nshould I love them less than heretofore?  Have they become dastards,\nand the fools of mankind?\"\n\nQuoth Richard:  \"They are no more fools than they were belike, nor less\nvaliant.  But thou art grown wiser and mightier by far; so that thou\nart another manner man than thou wert, and the Master of Masters maybe.\nTo Upmeads wilt thou go; but wilt thou abide there?  Upmeads is a fair\nland, but a narrow; one day is like another there, save when sorrow and\nharm is blent with it.  The world is wide, and now I deem that thou\nholdest the glory thereof in the hollow of thine hand.\"\n\nThen spake the Sage, and said:  \"Yea, Richard of Swevenham, and how\nknowest thou but that this sorrow and trouble have not now fallen upon\nUpmeads?  And if that be so, upon whom should they call to their\nhelping rather than him who can help them most, and is their very\nlord?\"  Said Richard: \"It may be so, wise man, though as yet we have\nheard no tidings thereof.  But if my lord goeth to their help, yet,\nwhen the trouble shall be over, will he not betake him thither where\nfresh deeds await him?\"\n\n\"Nay, Richard,\" said the Sage, \"art thou so little a friend of thy\nfosterling as not to know that when he hath brought back peace to the\nland, it will be so that both he shall need the people, and they him,\nso that if he go away for awhile, yet shall he soon come back?  Yea,\nand so shall the little land, it may be, grow great.\"\n\nNow had Ralph sat quiet while this talk was going on, and as if he\nheeded not, and his eyes were set as if he were beholding something far\naway.  Then Richard spoke again after there had been silence awhile:\n\"Wise man, thou sayest sooth; yea, and so it is, that though we here\nhave heard no tale concerning war in Upmeads, yet, as it were, we have\nbeen feeling some stirring of the air about us; even as though matters\nwere changing, great might undone, and weakness grown to strength.  Who\ncan say but our lord may find deeds to hand or ever he come to Upmeads?\"\n\nRalph turned his head as one awaking from a dream, and he said: \"When\nshall to-morrow be, that we may get us gone from Whitwall, we three,\nand turn our faces toward Upmeads?\"\n\nSaid Richard:  \"Wilt thou not tarry a day or two, and talk with thine\nown mother's son and tell him of thine haps?\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and\nso would I, were it not that my father's trouble and my mother's grief\ndraw me away.\"\n\n\"O tarry not,\" said Ursula; \"nay, not for the passing of the night; but\nmake this hour the sunrise, and begone by the clear of the moon.  For\nlo! how he shineth through the window!\"\n\nThen she turned to Richard, and said:  \"O fosterer of my love, knowest\nthou not that as now he speaketh as a Friend of the Well, and wotteth\nmore of far-off tidings than even this wise man of many years?\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"She sayeth sooth, O Richard.  Or how were it if the torch\nwere even now drawing nigh to the High House of Upmeads:  yea, or if\nthe very House were shining as a dreary candle of the meadows, and\nreddening the waters of the ford!  What do we here?\"\n\nTherewith he thrust the board from him, and arose and went to his\nharness, and fell to arming him, and he spake to Richard: \"Now shall\nthine authority open to us the gates of the good town, though the night\nbe growing old; we shall go our ways, dear friend, and mayhappen we\nshall meet again, and mayhappen not:  and thou shalt tell my brother\nBlaise who wotteth not of my coming hither, how things have gone with\nme, and how need hath drawn me hence.  And bid him come see me at\nUpmeads, and to ride with a good band of proper men, for eschewing the\ndangers of the road.\"\n\nThen spake Richard:  \"I shall tell Lord Blaise neither more nor less\nthan thou mayst tell him thyself:  for think it not that thou shalt go\nwithout me.  As for Blaise, he may well spare me; for he is become a\nchief and Lord of the Porte; and the Porte hath now right good\nmen-at-arms, and captains withal younger and defter than I be.  But now\nsuffer me to send a swain for my horse and arms, and another to the\ncaptain of the watch at West-gate Bar that he be ready to open to me\nand three of my friends, and to send me a let-pass for the occasion.\nSo shall we go forth ere it be known that the brother of the Lord of\nthe Porte is abiding at the Lamb.  For verily I see that the Lady hath\nspoken truth; and it is like that she is forseeing, even as thou hast\ngrown to be.  And now I bethink me I might lightly get me a score of\nmen to ride with us, whereas we may meet men worse than ourselves on\nthe way.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"All good go with thy words, Richard; yet gather not\nforce: there may stout men be culled on the road; and if thou runnest\nor ridest about the town, we may yet be stayed by Blaise and his men.\nWherefore now send for thine horse and arms, and bid the host here open\nhis gates with little noise when we be ready; and we will presently\nride out by the clear of the moon.  But thou, beloved, shalt don thine\narmour no more, but shalt ride henceforth in thy woman's raiment, for\nthe wild and the waste is well nigh over, and the way is but short\nafter all these months of wandering; and I say that now shall all\nfriends drift toward us, and they that shall rejoice to strike a stroke\nfor my father's son, and the peaceful years of the Friend of the Well.\"\n\nTo those others, and chiefly to Ursula, it seemed that now he spoke\nstrongly and joyously, like to a king and a captain of men.  Richard\ndid his bidding, and was swift in dealing with the messengers.  But the\nSage said:  \"Ralph, my son, since ye have lost one man-at-arms, and\nhave gotten but this golden angel in his stead, I may better that.  I\nprithee bid thy man Richard find me armour and weapons that I may amend\nthe shard in thy company.  Thou shalt find me no feeble man when we\ncome to push of staves.\"\n\nRalph laughed, and bade Richard see to it; so he dealt with the host,\nand bought good war-gear of him, and a trenchant sword, and an axe\nwithal; and when the Sage was armed he looked as doughty a warrior as\nneed be.  By this time was Richard's horse and war-gear come, and he\narmed him speedily and gave money to the host, and they rode therewith\nall four out of the hostel, and found the street empty and still, for\nthe night was wearing.  So rode they without tarrying into Westgate and\ncame to the Bar, and speedily was the gate opened to them; and anon\nwere they on the moonlit road outside of Whitwall.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nThey Ride Away From Whitwall\n\n\nBut when they were well on the way, and riding a good pace by the clear\nof the moon, Richard spake to Ralph, and said: \"Wither ride we now?\"\nsaid Ralph:  \"Wither, save to Upmeads?\" \"Yea, yea,\" said Richard, \"but\nby what road? shall we ride down to the ford of the Swelling Flood, and\nride the beaten way, or take to the downland and the forest, and so\nagain by the forest and downland and the forest once more, till we come\nto the Burg of the Four Friths?\"\n\n\"Which way is the shorter?\" said Ralph.  \"Forsooth,\" said Richard, \"by\nthe wildwood ye may ride shorter, if ye know it as I do.\" Quoth the\nSage:  \"Yea, or as I do.  Hear a wonder! that two men of Swevenham know\nthe wilds more than twenty miles from their own thorp.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Well, wend we the shorter road; why make more words over\nit?  Or what lion lieth on the path?  Is it that we may find it hard to\ngive the go-by to the Burg of the Four Friths?\"\n\nSaid Richard:  \"Though the Burg be not very far from Whitwall, we hear\nbut little tidings thence; our chapmen but seldom go there, and none\ncometh to us thence save such of our men as have strayed thither.  Yet,\nas I said e'en now in the hostel, there is an air of tidings abroad,\nand one rumour sayeth, and none denieth it, that the old fierceness and\nstout headstrong mood of the Burg is broken down, and that men dwell\nthere in peace and quiet.\"\n\nSaid the Sage:  \"In any case we have amongst us lore enough to hoodwink\nthem if they be foes; so that we shall pass easily.  Naught of this\nneed we fear.\"\n\nBut Richard put his mouth close to Ralph's ear, and spake to him\nsoftly: \"Shall we indeed go by that shorter road, whatever in days gone\nby may have befallen in places thereon, to which we must go a-nigh\ntomorrow?\" Ralph answered softly in turn:  \"Yea, forsooth:  for I were\nfain to try my heart, how strong it may be.\"\n\nSo they rode on, and turned off from the road that led down to the ford\nof the Swelling Flood, anigh which Ralph had fallen in with Blaise and\nRichard on the day after the woeful slaying, which had made an end of\nhis joy for that time.  But when they were amidst of the bushes and\nriding a deep ghyll of the waste, Richard said:  \"It is well that we\nare here: for now if Blaise send riders to bring us back courteously,\nthey shall not follow us at once, but shall ride straight down to the\nford, and even cross it in search of us.\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"it is\nwell in all wise.\"\n\nSo then they rode thence awhile till the moon grew low, and great, and\nred, and sank down away from them; and by then were they come to a\nshepherd's cot, empty of men, with naught therein save an old dog, and\nsome victual, as bread and white cheese, and a well for drinking.  So\nthere they abode and rested that night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nA Strange Meeting in the Wilderness\n\n\nOn the morrow betimes they got to the road again; the country at first,\nthough it was scanty of tillage, was not unfurnished of sheep, being\nfor the most part of swelling hills and downs well grassed, with here\nand there a deep cleft in them.  They saw but few houses, and those\nsmall and poor.  A few shepherds they fell in with, who were short of\nspeech, after the manner of such men, but deemed a greeting not wholly\nthrown away on such goodly folk as those wayfarers.\n\nSo they rode till it was noon, and Richard talked more than his wont\nwas, though his daily use it was to be of many words: nor did the Sage\nspare speech; but Ursula spoke little, nor heeded much what the others\nsaid, and Ralph deemed that she was paler than of wont, and her brows\nwere knitted as if she were somewhat anxious.  As for him, he was grave\nand calm, but of few words; and whiles when Richard was wordiest he\nlooked on him steadily for a moment whereat Richard changed\ncountenance, and for a while stinted his speech, but not for long;\nwhile Ralph looked about him, inwardly striving to gather together the\nends of unhappy thoughts that floated about him, and to note the land\nhe was passing through, if indeed he had verily seen it aforetime,\nelsewhere than in some evil dream.\n\nAt last when they stopped to bait by some scrubby bushes at the foot of\na wide hill-side, he took Richard apart, and said to him:  \"Old friend,\nand whither go we?\"  Said Richard: \"As thou wottest, to the Burg of the\nFour Friths.\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"but by what road?\"  Said Richard:\n\"Youngling is not thine heart, then, as strong as thou deemedst last\nnight?\"  Ralph was silent a while, and then he said: \"I know what thou\nwouldst say; we are going by the shortest road to the Castle of\nAbundance.\"\n\nHe spake this out loud, but Richard nodded his head to him, as if he\nwould say:  \"Yea, so it is; but hold thy peace.\"  But Ralph knew that\nUrsula had come up behind him, and, still looking at Richard, he put\nhis open hand aback toward her, and her hand fell into it.  Then he\nturned about to her, and saw that her face was verily pale; so he put\nhis hands on her shoulders and kissed her kindly; and she let her head\nfall on to his bosom and fell a-weeping, and the two elders turned away\nto the horses, and feigned to be busy with them.\n\nThus then they bided some minutes of time, and then all gat to horse\nagain, and Ursula's face was cleared of the grief of fear, and the\ncolour had come back to her cheeks and lips.  But Ralph's face was\nstern and sorrowful to behold; howbeit, as they rode away he spake in a\nloud and seeming cheerful voice: \"Still ever shorteneth more and more\nthe way unto my Fathers' House: and withal I am wishful to see if it be\nindeed true that the men of the Burg have become mild and peaceful; and\nto know what hath befallen those doughty champions of the Dry Tree; and\nif perchance they have any will to hold us a tilting in courteous\nfashion.\"\n\nRichard smiled on him, and said:  \"Thou holdest more then by the Dry\nTree than by the Burg; though while agone we deemed the Champions worse\nmen to meet in the wood than the Burgers.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Ralph; \"but men are oft mis-said by them that know\nthem not thoroughly:  and now, if it were a good wish, O Sage of\nSwevenham, I were fain to fall in with the best of all those champions,\na tall man and a proper, who, meseems, had good-will toward me, I know\nnot why.\"\n\nQuoth the Sage:  \"If thou canst not see the end of this wish fulfilled,\nno more can I. And yet, meseems something may follow it which is akin\nto grief:  be content with things so done, my son.\"\n\nNow Ralph holds his peace, and they speed on their way, Ursula riding\nclose by Ralph's side, and caressing him with looks, and by touch also\nwhen she might; and after a while he fell to talking again, and ever in\nthe same loud, cheerful voice.  Till at last, in about another hour,\nthey came in sight of the stream which ran down toward the Swelling\nFlood from that pool wherein erst the Lady of Abundance had bathed her\nbefore the murder.  Hard looked Ralph on the stream, but howsoever his\nheart might ache with the memory of that passed grief, like as the body\naches with the bruise of yesterday's blow, yet he changed countenance\nbut little, and in his voice was the same cheery sound.  But Ursula\nnoted him, and how his eyes wandered, and how little he heeded the\nwords of the others, and she knew what ailed him, for long ago he had\ntold her all that tale, and so now her heart was troubled, and she\nlooked on him and was silent.\n\nThus, then, a little before sunset, they came on that steep cliff with\nthe cave therein, and the little green plain thereunder, and the rocky\nbank going down sheer into the water of the stream.  Forsooth they came\non it somewhat suddenly from out of the bushes of the valley; and there\nindeed not only the Sage and Richard, but Ursula also, were stayed by\nthe sight as folk compelled; for all three knew what had befallen\nthere.  But Ralph, though he looked over his shoulder at it all, yet\nrode on steadily, and when he saw that the others lingered, he waved\nhis hand and cried out as he rode: \"On, friends, on! for the road\nshortens towards my Fathers' House.\" Then were they ashamed, and shook\ntheir reins to hasten after him.\n\nBut in that very nick of time there came forth one from amidst the\nbushes that edged the pool of the stream and strode dripping on to the\nshallow; a man brown and hairy, and naked, save for a green wreath\nabout his middle.  Tall he was above the stature of most men; awful of\naspect, and his eyes glittered from his dark brown face amidst of his\nshockhead of the colour of rain-spoilt hay.  He stood and looked while\none might count five, and then without a word or cry rushed up from the\nwater, straight on Ursula, who was riding first of the three lingerers,\nand in the twinkling of an eye tore her from off her horse; and she was\nin his grasp as the cushat in the claws of the kite.  Then he cast her\nto earth, and stood over her, shaking a great club, but or ever he\nbrought it down he turned his head over his shoulder toward the cliff\nand the cave therein, and in that same moment first one blade and then\nanother flashed about him, and he fell crashing down upon his back,\nsmitten in the breast and the side by Richard and Ralph; and the wounds\nwere deep and deadly.\n\nRalph heeded him no more, but drew Ursula away from him, and raised her\nup and laid her head upon his knee; and she had not quite swooned away,\nand forsooth had taken but little hurt; only she was dizzy with terror\nand the heaving up and casting down.\n\nShe looked up into Ralph's face, and smiled on him and said: \"What hath\nbeen done to me, and why did he do it?\"\n\nHis eyes were still wild with fear and wrath, as he answered:  \"O\nBeloved, Death and the foeman of old came forth from the cavern of the\ncliff.  What did they there, Lord God? and he caught thee to slay thee;\nbut him have I slain.  Nevertheless, it is a terrible and evil place:\nlet us go hence.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"let us go speedily!\"  Then she stood up, weak and\ntottering still, and Ralph arose and put his left arm about her to stay\nher; and lo, there before them was Richard kneeling over the wild-man,\nand the Sage was coming back from the river with his headpiece full of\nwater; so Ralph cried out:  \"To horse, Richard, to horse!  Hast thou\nnot done slaying the woodman?\"\n\nBut therewith came a weak and hoarse voice from the earth, and the\nwild-man spake.  \"Child of Upmeads, drive not on so hard: it will not\nbe long.  For thou and Richard the Red are naught lighthanded.\"\n\nRalph marvelled that the wild-man knew him and Richard, but the\nwild-man spake again:  \"Hearken, thou lover, thou young man!\"\n\nBut therewith was the Sage come to him and kneeling beside him with the\nwater, and he drank thereof, while Ralph said to him: \"What is this\nwoodman? and canst thou speak my Latin?  What art thou?\"\n\nThen the wild-man when he had drunk raised him up a little, and said:\n\"Young man, thou and Richard are deft leeches; ye have let me blood to\na purpose, and have brought back to me my wits, which were wandering\nwide.  Yet am I indeed where my fool's brains told me I was.\"\n\nThen he lay back again, and turned his head as well as he could toward\nthe cavern in the cliff.  But Ralph deemed he had heard his voice\nbefore, and his heart was softened toward him, he knew not why; but he\nsaid: \"Yea, but wherefore didst thou fall upon the Lady?\"  The wild-man\nstrove with his weakness, and said angrily:  \"What did another woman\nthere?\" Then he said in a calmer but weaker voice:  \"Nay, my wits shall\nwander no more from me; we will make the journey together, I and my\nwits.  But O, young man, this I will say if I can.  Thou fleddest from\nher and forgattest her.  I came to her and forgat all but her; yea, my\nvery life I forgat.\"\n\nAgain he spoke, and his voice was weaker yet:  \"Kneel down by me, or I\nmay not tell thee what I would; my voice dieth before me.\"\n\nThen Ralph knelt down by him, for he began to have a deeming of what he\nwas, and he put his face close to the dying man's, and said to him; \"I\nam here, what wouldst thou?\"\n\nSaid the wild-man very feebly:  \"I did not much for thee time was; how\nmight I, when I loved her so sorely?  But I did a little.  Believe it,\nand do so much for me that I may lie by her side when I am dead, who\nnever lay by her living.  For into the cave I durst go never.\"\n\nThen Ralph knew him, that he was the tall champion whom he had met\nfirst at the churchyard gate of Netherton; so he said: \"I know thee\nnow, and I will promise to do thy will herein.  I am sorry that I have\nslain thee; forgive it me.\"\n\nA mocking smile came into the dying man's eyes, and he spake\nwhispering: \"Richard it was; not thou.\"\n\nThe smile spread over his face, he strove to turn more toward Ralph,\nand said in a very faint whisper:  \"The last time!\"\n\nNo more he said, but gave up the ghost presently.  The Sage rose up\nfrom his side and said:  \"Ye may now bury this man as he craved of\nthee, for he is dead.  Thus hath thy wish been accomplished; for this\nwas the great champion and duke of the men of the Dry Tree.  Indeed it\nis a pity of him that he is dead, for as terrible as he was to his\nfoes, he was no ill man.\"\n\nSpake Richard:  \"Now is the riddle areded of the wild-man and the\nmighty giant that haunted these passes.  We have played together or\nnow, in days long past, he and I; and ever he came to his above.  He\nwas a wise man and a prudent that he should have become a wild-man.  It\nis great pity of him.\"\n\nBut Ralph took his knight's cloak of red scarlet, and they lapped the\nwild-man therein, who had once been a champion beworshipped.  But first\nUrsula sheared his hair and his beard, till the face of him came back\nagain, grave, and somewhat mocking, as Ralph remembered it, time was.\nThen they bore him in the four corners across the stream, and up on to\nthe lawn before the cliff; and Richard and the Sage bore him into the\ncave, and laid him down there beside the howe which Ralph had erewhile\nheaped over the Lady; and now over him also they heaped stones.\n\nMeanwhile Ursula knelt at the mouth of the cave and wept; but Ralph\nturned him about and stood on the edge of the bank, and looked over the\nripple of the stream on to the valley, where the moon was now beginning\nto cast shadows, till those two came out of the cave for the last time.\nThen Ralph turned to Ursula and raised her up and kissed her, and they\nwent down all of them from that place of death and ill-hap, and gat to\nhorse on the other side of the stream, and rode three miles further on\nby the glimmer of the moon, and lay down to rest amongst the bushes of\nthe waste, with few words spoken between them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nThey Come to the Castle of Abundance Once More\n\n\nWhen they rode on next morning Ralph was few-spoken, and seemed to heed\nlittle so long as they made good speed on the way: most of the talk was\nbetwixt Richard and the Sage, Ralph but putting in a word when it would\nhave seemed churlish to forbear.\n\nSo they went their ways through the wood till by then the sun was well\nwestering they came out at the Water of the Oak, and Richard drew rein\nthere, and spake:  \"Here is a fair place for a summer night's lodging,\nand I would warrant both good knight and fair lady have lain here\naforetime, and wished the dark longer: shall we not rest here?\"\n\nRalph stared at him astonished, and then anger grew in his face for a\nlittle, because, forsooth, as Richard and the Sage both wotted of the\nplace of the slaying of the Lady, and he himself had every yard of the\nway in his mind as they went, it seemed but due that they should have\nknown of this place also, what betid there: but it was not so, and the\nplace was to Richard like any other lawn of the woodland.\n\nBut thought came back to Ralph in a moment, and he smiled at his own\nfolly, howbeit he could not do to lie another night on that lawn with\nother folk than erst.  So he said quietly: \"Nay, friend, were we not\nbetter to make the most of this daylight?  Seest thou it wants yet an\nhour of sunset?\"\n\nRichard nodded a yeasay, and the Sage said no word more; but Ursula\ncast her anxious look on Ralph as though she understood what was moving\nin him; and therewith those others rode away lightly, but Ralph turned\nslowly from the oak-tree, and might not forbear looking on to the short\nsward round about, as if he hoped to see some token left behind.  Then\nhe lifted up his face as one awaking, shook his rein, and rode after\nthe others down the long water.\n\nSo they turned from the water anon, and rode the woodland ways, and lay\nthat night by a stream that ran west.\n\nThey arose betimes on the morrow, and whereas the Sage knew the\nwoodland ways well, they made but a short journey of it to the Castle\nof Abundance, and came into the little plain but two hours after noon,\nwhere saving that the scythe had not yet wended the tall mowing grass\nin the crofts which the beasts and sheep were not pasturing, all was as\non that other tide.  The folk were at work in their gardens, or herding\ntheir cattle in the meads, and as aforetime they were merry of\ncountenance and well-clad, fair and gentle to look on.\n\nThere were their pleasant cots, and the little white church, and the\nfair walls of the castle on its low mound, and the day bright and\nsunny, all as aforetime, and Ralph looked on it all, and made no\ncountenance of being moved beyond his wont.\n\nSo they came out of the wood, and rode to the ford of the river, and\nthe carles and queans came streaming from their garths and meads to\nmeet them, and stood round wondering at them; but an old carle came\nfrom out the throng and went up to Ralph, and hailed him, and said:\n\"Oh, Knight! and hast thou come back to us? and has thou brought us\ntidings of our Lady?  Who is this fair woman that rideth with thee?  Is\nit she?\"\n\nSpake Ralph:  \"Nay; go look on her closely, and tell me thy deeming of\nher.\"\n\nSo the carle went up to Ursula, and peered closely into her face, and\ntook her hand and looked on it, and knelt down and took her foot out of\nthe stirrup, and kissed it, and then came back to Ralph, and said:\n\"Fair Sir, I wot not but it may be her sister; for yonder old wise man\nI have seen here erst with our heavenly Lady.  But though this fair\nwoman may be her sister, it is not she.  So tell me what is become of\nher, for it is long since we have seen her; and what thou tellest us,\nthat same shall we trow, even as if thou wert her angel.  For I spake\nwith thee, it is nigh two years agone, when thou wert abiding the\ncoming of our Lady in the castle yonder But now I see of thee that thou\nart brighter-faced, and mightier of aspect than aforetime, and it is in\nmy mind that the Lady of Abundance must have loved thee and holpen\nthee, and blessed thee with some great blessing.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Old man, canst thou feel sorrow, and canst thou bear it?\"\nThe carle shook his head.  \"I wot not,\" said he, \"I fear thy words.\"\nSaid Ralph:  \"It were naught to say less than the truth; and this is\nthe very truth, that thou shalt never see thy Lady any more.  I was the\nlast living man that ever saw her alive.\"\n\nThen he spake in a loud voice and said:  \"Lament, ye people! for the\nLady of Abundance is dead; yet sure I am that she sendeth this message\nto you, Live in peace, and love ye the works of the earth.\"\n\nBut when they heard him, the old man covered up his face with the folds\nof his gown, and all that folk brake forth into weeping, and crying\nout: \"Woe for us! the Lady of Abundance is dead!\" and some of the\nyounger men cast themselves down on to the earth, and wallowed, weeping\nand wailing: and there was no man there that seemed as if he knew which\nway to turn, or what to do; and their faces were foolish with sorrow.\nYet forsooth it was rather the carles than the queans who made all this\nlamentation.\n\nAt last the old man spake:  \"Fair sir, ye have brought us heavy\ntidings, and we know not how to ask you to tell us more of the tale.\nYet if thou might'st but tell us how the Lady died?  Woe's me for the\nword!\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"She was slain with the sword.\"\n\nThe old man drew himself up stiff and stark, the eyes of him glittered\nunder his white hair, and wrath changed his face, and the other\nmen-folk thronged them to hearken what more should be said.\n\nBut the elder spake again:  \"Tell me who it was that slew her, for\nsurely shall I slay him, or die in the pain else.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Be content, thou mayst not slay him; he was a great and\nmighty man, a baron who bore a golden sun on a blue field.  Thou mayst\nnot slay him.\"  \"Yea,\" said the old man, \"but I will, or he me.\"\n\n\"Live in peace,\" said Ralph, \"for I slew him then and there.\"\n\nThe old man held his peace a while, and then he said: \"I know the man,\nfor he hath been here aforetime, and not so long ago.  But if he be\ndead, he hath a brother yet, an exceeding mighty man: he will be coming\nhere to vex us and minish us.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"He will not stir from where he lies till Earth's bones be\nbroken, for my sword lay in his body yesterday.\"\n\nThe old man stood silent again, and the other carles thronged him; but\nthe woman stood aloof staring on Ralph.  Then the elder came up to\nRalph and knelt before him and kissed his feet; then he turned and\ncalled to him three of the others who were of the stoutest and most\nstalwarth, and he spake with them awhile, and then he came to Ralph\nagain, and again knelt before him and said:  \"Lord, ye have come to us,\nand found us void of comfort, since we have lost our Lady.  But we see\nin thee, that she hath loved thee and blessed thee, and thou hast slain\nher slayer and his kindred.  And we see of thee also that thou art a\ngood lord.  O the comfort to us, therefore, if thou wouldest be our\nLord!  We will serve thee truly so far as we may:  yea, even if thou be\nbeset by foes, we will take bow and bill from the wall, and stand round\nabout thee and fight for thee.  Only thou must not ask us to go hence\nfrom this place: for we know naught but the Plain of Abundance, and the\nedges of the wood, and the Brethren of the House of the Thorn, who are\nnot far hence.  Now we pray thee by thy fathers not to naysay us, so\nsore as thou hast made our hearts.  Also we see about thy neck the\nsame-like pair of beads which our Lady was wont to bear, and we deem\nthat ye were in one tale together.\"\n\nThen was Ralph silent awhile, but the Sage spake to the elder: \"Old\nman, how great is the loss of the Lady to you?\" \"Heavy loss, wise old\nman,\" said the carle, \"as thou thyself mayst know, having known her.\"\n\n\"And what did she for you?\" said the Sage.  Said the elder: \"We know\nthat she was gracious to us; never did she lay tax or tale on us, and\nwhiles she would give us of her store, and that often, and abundantly.\nWe deem also that every time when she came to us our increase became\nmore plenteous, which is well seen by this, that since she hath ceased\nto come, the seasons have been niggard unto us.\"\n\nThe Sage smiled somewhat, and the old man went on: \"But chiefly the\nblessing was to see her when she came to us: for verily it seemed that\nwhere she set her feet the grass grew greener, and that the flowers\nblossomed fairer where the shadow of her body fell.\" And therewith the\nold man fell a-weeping again.\n\nThe Sage held his peace, and Ralph still kept silence; and now of these\nmen all the younger ones had their eyes upon Ursula.\n\nAfter a while Ralph spake and said:  \"O elder, and ye folk of the\nPeople of Abundance, true it is that your Lady who is dead loved me,\nand it is through her that I am become a Friend of the Well.  Now\nmeseemeth though ye have lost your Lady, whom ye so loved and\nworshipped, God wot not without cause, yet I wot not why ye now cry out\nfor a master, since ye dwell here in peace and quiet and all wealth,\nand the Fathers of the Thorn are here to do good to you.  Yet, if ye\nwill it in sooth, I will be called your Lord, in memory of your Lady\nwhom ye shall not see again.  And as time wears I will come and look on\nyou and hearken to your needs: and if ye come to fear that any should\nfall upon you with the strong hand, then send ye a message to me, Ralph\nof Upmeads, down by the water, and I will come to you with such\nfollowing as need be.  And as for service, this only I lay upon you,\nthat ye look to the Castle and keep it in good order, and ward it\nagainst thieves and runagates, and give guesting therein to any\nwandering knight or pilgrim, or honest goodman, who shall come to you.\nNow is all said, my masters, and I pray you let us depart in peace; for\ntime presses.\"\n\nThen all they (and this time women as well as men) cried out joyfully:\n\"Hail to our lord! and long life to our helper.\"  And the women withal\ndrew nearer to him, and some came close up to him, as if they would\ntouch him or kiss his hand, but by seeming durst not, but stood\nblushing before him, and he looked on them, smiling kindly.\n\nBut the old man laid his hand on his knee and said: \"Lord, wouldst thou\nnot light down and enter thy Castle; for none hath more right there now\nthan thou.  The Prior of the Thorn hath told us that there is no\nlineage of the Lady left to claim it; and none other might ever have\nclaimed it save the Baron of Sunway, whom thou hast slain.  And else\nwould we have slain him, since he slew our Lady.\"\n\nRalph shook his head and said:  \"Nay, old friend, and new vassal, this\nwe may not do:  we must on speedily, for belike there is work for us to\ndo nearer home.\"\n\n\"Yea, Lord,\" said the carle, \"but at least light down and sit for a\nwhile under this fair oak-tree in the heat of the day, and eat a morsel\nwith us, and drink a cup, that thy luck may abide with us when thou art\ngone.\"\n\nRalph would not naysay him; so he and all of them got off their horses,\nand sat down on the green grass under the oak: and that people gathered\nabout and sat down by them, save that a many of the women went to their\nhouses to fetch out the victual.  Meanwhile the carles fell to speech\nfreely with the wayfarers, and told them much concerning their little\nland, were it hearsay, or stark sooth:  such as tales of the wights\nthat dwelt in the wood, wodehouses, and elf-women, and dwarfs, and such\nlike, and how fearful it were to deal with such creatures.  Amongst\nother matters they told how a hermit, a holy man, had come to dwell in\nthe wood, in a clearing but a little way thence toward the north-west.\nBut when Ralph asked if he dwelt on the way to the ford of the Swelling\nFlood, they knew not what he meant; for the wood was to them as a wall.\n\nHereon the Sage held one of the younger men in talk, and taught him\nwhat he might of the way to the Burg of the Four Friths, so that they\nmight verily send a messenger to Upmeads if need were.  But the country\nyouth said there was no need to think thereof, as no man of theirs\nwould dare the journey through the wood, and that if they had need of a\nmessenger, one of the Fathers of the Thorn would do their errand,\nwhereas they were holy men, and knew the face of the world full well.\n\nNow in this while the folk seemed to have gotten their courage again,\nand to be cheery, and to have lost their grief for the Lady: and of the\nmaidens left about the oak were more than two or three very fair, who\nstood gazing at Ralph as if they were exceeding fain of him.\n\nBut amidst these things came back the women with the victual; to wit\nbread in baskets, and cheeses both fresh and old, and honey, and\nwood-strawberries, and eggs cooked diversely, and skewers of white wood\nwith gobbets of roasted lamb's flesh, and salad good plenty.  All these\nthey bore first to Ralph and Ursula, and their two fellows, and then\ndealt them to their own folk: and they feasted and were merry in\ndespite of that tale of evil tidings.  They brought also bowls and\npitchers of wine that was good and strong, and cider of their orchards,\nand called many a health to the new Lord and his kindred.\n\nThus then they abode a-feasting till the sun was westering and the\nshadows waxed about them, and then at last Ralph rose up and called to\nhorse, and the other wayfarers arose also, and the horses were led up\nto them.  Then the maidens, made bold by the joy of the feast, and\nbeing stirred to the heart by much beholding of this beloved Lord, cast\noff their shamefacedness and crowded about him, and kissed his raiment\nand his hands: some even, though trembling, and more for love than\nfear, prayed him for kisses, and he, nothing loath, laughed merrily and\nlaid his hands on their shoulders or took them by the chins, and set\nhis lips to the sweetness of their cheeks and their lips, of those that\nasked and those that refrained; so that their hearts failed them for\nlove of him, and when he was gone, they knew not how to go back to\ntheir houses, or the places that were familiar to them.  Therewith he\nand his got into their saddles and rode away slowly, because of the\nthronging about them of that folk, who followed them to the edge of the\nwood, and even entered a little thereinto; and then stood gazing on\nRalph and his fellows after they had spurred on and were riding down a\nglade of the woodland.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nThey Fall in With That Hermit\n\n\nSo much had they tarried over this greeting and feasting, that though\nthey had hoped to have come to the hermit's house that night, he of\nwhom that folk had told them, it fell not so, whereas the day had aged\nso much ere they left the Plain of Abundance that it began to dusk\nbefore they had gone far, and they must needs stay and await the dawn\nthere; so they dight their lodging as well as they might, and lay down\nand slept under the thick boughs.\n\nRalph woke about sunrise, and looking up saw a man standing over him,\nand deemed at first that it would be Richard or the Sage; but as his\nvision cleared, he saw that it was neither of them, but a new comer; a\nstout carle clad in russet, with a great staff in his hand and a\nshort-sword girt to his side.  Ralph sprang up, still not utterly\nawake, and cried out, \"Who art thou, carle?\"  The man laughed, and\nsaid: \"Yea, thou art still the same brisk lad, only filled out to\nsomething more warrior-like than of old.  But it is unmeet to forget\nold friends.  Why dost thou not hail me?\"\n\n\"Because I know thee not, good fellow,\" said Ralph.  But even as he\nspoke, he looked into the man's face again, and cried out:  \"By St.\nNicholas! but it is Roger of the Ropewalk.  But look you, fellow, if I\nhave somewhat filled out, thou, who wast always black-muzzled, art now\nbecome as hairy as a wodehouse.  What dost thou in the wilds?\"  Said\nRoger:  \"Did they not tell thee of a hermit new come to these shaws?\"\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph.  \"I am that holy man,\" quoth Roger, grinning; \"not\nthat I am so much of that, either.  I have not come hither to pray or\nfast overmuch, but to rest my soul and be out of the way of men.  For\nall things have changed since my Lady passed away.\"\n\nHe looked about, and saw Ursula just rising up from the ground and the\nSage stirring, while Richard yet hugged his bracken bed, snoring.  So\nhe said:  \"And who be these, and why hast thou taken to the wildwood?\nYea lad, I see of thee, that thou hast gotten another Lady; and if mine\neyes do not fail me she is fair enough.  But there be others as fair;\nwhile the like to our Lady that was, there is none such.\"\n\nHe fell silent a while, and Ralph turned about to the others, for by\nthis time Richard also was awake, and said: \"This man is the hermit of\nwhom we were told.\"\n\nRoger said:  \"Yea, I am the hermit and the holy man; and withal I have\na thing to hear and a thing to tell.  Ye were best to come with me, all\nof you, to my house in the woods; a poor one, forsooth, but there is\nsomewhat of victual here, and we can tell and hearken therein well\nsheltered and at peace.  So to horse, fair folk.\"\n\nThey would not be bidden twice, but mounted and went along with him,\nwho led them by a thicket path about a mile, till they came to a lawn\nwhere-through ran a stream; and there was a little house in it, simple\nenough, of one hall, built with rough tree-limbs and reed thatch.  He\nbrought them in, and bade them sit on such stools or bundles of stuff\nas were there.  But withal he brought out victual nowise ill, though it\nwere but simple also, of venison of the wildwood, with some little deal\nof cakes baked on the hearth, and he poured for them also both milk and\nwine.\n\nThey were well content with the banquet, and when they were full, Roger\nsaid: \"Now, my Lord, like as oft befalleth minstrels, ye have had your\nwages before your work.  Fall to, then, and pay me the scot by telling\nme all that hath befallen you since (woe worth the while!) my Lady\ndied,--I must needs say, for thy sake.\"\n\n\"'All' is a big word,\" said Ralph, \"but I will tell thee somewhat.  Yet\nI bid thee take note that I and this ancient wise one, and my Lady\nwithal, deem that I am drawn by my kindred to come to their help, and\nthat time presses.\"\n\nRoger scowled somewhat on Ursula; but he said:  \"Lord and master, let\nnot that fly trouble thy lip.  For so I deem of it, that whatsoever\ntime ye may lose by falling in with me, ye may gain twice as much again\nby hearkening my tale and the rede that shall go with it.  And I do\nthee to wit that the telling of thy tale shall unfreeze mine; so tarry\nnot, if ye be in haste to be gone, but let thy tongue wag.\"\n\nRalph smiled, and without more ado told him all that had befallen him;\nand of Swevenham and Utterbol, and of his captivity and flight; and of\nthe meeting in the wood, and of the Sage (who there was), and of the\njourney to the Well, and what betid there and since, and of the death\nof the Champion of the Dry Tree.\n\nBut when he had made an end, Roger said:  \"There it is, then, as I said\nwhen she first spake to me of thee and bade me bring about that meeting\nwith her, drawing thee first to the Burg and after to the Castle of\nAbundance, I have forgotten mostly by what lies; but I said to her that\nshe had set her heart on a man over lucky, and that thou wouldst take\nher luck from her and make it thine.  But now I will let all that pass,\nand will bid thee ask what thou wilt; and I promise thee that I will\nhelp thee to come thy ways to thy kindred, that thou mayst put forth\nthy luck in their behalf.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"First of all, tell me what shall I do to pass unhindered\nthrough the Burg of the Four Friths?\"  Said Roger: \"Thou shalt go in at\none gate and out at the other, and none shall hinder thee.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"And shall I have any hindrance from them of the Dry Tree?\"\n\nRoger made as if he were swallowing down something, and answered: \"Nay,\nnone.\"\n\n\"And the folk of Higham by the Way, and the Brethren and their Abbot?\"\nsaid Ralph.\n\n\"I know but little of them,\" quoth Roger, \"but I deem that they will\nmake a push to have thee for captain; because they have had war on\ntheir hands of late.  But this shall be at thine own will to say yea or\nnay to them.  But for the rest on this side of the shepherds' country\nye will pass by peaceful folk.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"what then hath become of the pride and cruelty of\nthe Burg of the Four Friths, and the eagerness and fierceness of the\nDry Tree?\"\n\nQuoth Roger:  \"This is the tale of it:  After the champions of the Dry\nTree had lost their queen and beloved, the Lady of Abundance, they were\nboth restless and fierce, for the days of sorrow hung heavy on their\nhands.  So on a time a great company of them had ado with the Burgers\nsomewhat recklessly and came to the worse; wherefore some drew back\ninto their fastness of the Scaur and the others still rode on, and\nfurther west than their wont had been; but warily when they had the\nWood Perilous behind them, for they had learned wisdom again.  Thus\nriding they had tidings of an host of the Burg of the Four Friths who\nwere resting in a valley hard by with a great train of captives and\nbeasts and other spoil: for they had been raising the fray against the\nWheat-wearers, and had slain many carles there, and were bringing home\nto the Burg many young women and women-children, after their custom.\nSo they of the Dry Tree advised them of these tidings, and deemed that\nit would ease the sorrow of their hearts for their Lady if they could\ndeal with these sons of whores and make a mark upon the Burg: so they\nlay hid while the daylight lasted, and by night and cloud fell upon\nthese faineants of the Burg, and won them good cheap, as was like to\nbe, though the Burg-dwellers were many the more.  Whereof a many were\nslain, but many escaped and gat home to the Burg, even as will lightly\nhappen even in the worst of overthrows, that not all, or even the more\npart be slain.\n\n\"Well, there were the champions and their prey, which was very great,\nand especially of women, of whom the more part were young and fair: for\nthe women of the Wheat-wearers be goodly, and these had been picked out\nby the rutters of the Burg for their youth and strength and beauty.\nAnd whereas the men of the Dry Tree were scant of women at home, and\nsore-hearted because of our Lady, they forbore not these women, but\nfell to talking with them and loving them; howbeit in courteous and\nmanly fashion, so that the women deemed themselves in heaven and were\nready to do anything to please their lovers.  So the end of it was that\nthe Champions sent messengers to Hampton and the Castle of the Scaur to\ntell what had betid, and they themselves took the road to the land of\nthe Wheat-wearers, having those women with them not as captives but as\nfree damsels.\n\n\"Now the road to the Wheat-wearing country was long, and on the way the\ndamsels told their new men many things of their land and their unhappy\nwars with them of the Burg and the griefs and torments which they\nendured of them.  And this amongst other things, that wherever they\ncame, they slew all the males even to the sucking babe, but spared the\nwomen, even when they bore them not into captivity.\n\n\"'Whereof,' said these poor damsels, 'it cometh that our land is\nill-furnished of carles, so that we women, high and low, go afield and\ndo many things, as crafts and the like, which in other lands are done\nby carles.' In sooth it seemed of them that they were both of stouter\nfashion, and defter than women are wont to be.  So the champions, part\nin jest, part in earnest, bade them do on the armour of the slain\nBurgers, and take their weapons, and fell to teaching them how to\nhandle staff and sword and bow; and the women took heart from the\nvaliant countenance of their new lovers, and deemed it all bitter\nearnest enough, and learned their part speedily; and yet none too soon.\nFor when the fleers of the Burg came home the Porte lost no time, but\nsent out another host to follow after the Champions and their spoil;\nfor they had learned that those men had not turned about to Hampton\nafter their victory, but had gone on to the Wheat-wearers.\n\n\"So it befell that the host of the Burg came up with the Champions on\nthe eve of a summer day when there were yet three hours of daylight.\nBut whereas they had looked to have an easy bargain of their foemen,\nsince they knew the Champions to be but a few, lo! there was the\nhillside covered with a goodly array of spears and glaives and shining\nhelms.  They marvelled; but now for very shame, and because they scarce\ncould help it, they fell on, and before sunset were scattered to the\nwinds again, and the fleers had to bear back the tale that the more\npart of their foes were women of the Wheat-wearers; but this time few\nwere those that came back alive to the Burg of the Four Friths; for the\nfreed captives were hot and eager in the chase, casting aside their\nshields and hauberks that they might speed the better, and valuing\ntheir lives at naught if they might but slay a man or two of the\ntyrants before they died.\n\n\"Thus was the Burg wounded with its own sword:  but the matter stopped\nnot there:  for when that victorious host of men and women came into\nthe land of the Wheat-wearers, all men fled away in terror at first,\nthinking that it was a new onset of the men of the Burg; and that all\nthe more, as so many of them bore their weapons and armour.  But when\nthey found out how matters had gone, then, as ye may deem, was the\ngreatest joy and exultation, and carles and queans both ran to arms and\nbade their deliverers learn them all that belonged to war, and said\nthat one thing should not be lacking, to wit, the gift of their bodies,\nthat should either lie dead in the fields, or bear about henceforth the\nsouls of free men.  Nothing lothe, the Champions became their doctors\nand teachers of battle, and a great host was drawn together; and\nmeanwhile the Champions had sent messengers again to Hampton telling\nthem what was befallen, and asking for more men if they might be had.\nBut the Burg-abiders were not like to sit down under their foil.\nAnother host they sent against the Wheat-wearers, not so huge, as well\narrayed and wise in war.  The Champions espied its goings, and knew\nwell that they had to deal with the best men of the Burg, and they met\nthem in like wise; for they chose the very best of the men and the\nwomen, and pitched on a place whence they might ward them well, and\nabode the foemen there; who failed not to come upon them, stout and\nstern and cold, and well-learned in all feats of war.\n\n\"Long and bitter was the battle, and the Burgers were fierce without\nhead-strong folly, and the Wheat-wearers deemed that if they blenched\nnow, they had something worse than death to look to.  But in the end\nwhen both sides were grown weary and worn out, and yet neither would\nflee, on a sudden came into the field the help from the Dry Tree, a\nvaliant company of riders to whom battle was but game and play.  Then\nindeed the men of the Burg gave back and drew out of the battle as best\nthey might: yet were they little chased, save by the new-comers of the\nDry Tree, for the others were over weary, and moreover the leaders had\nno mind to let the new-made warriors leave their vantage-ground lest\nthe old and tried men-at-arms of the Burg should turn upon them and put\nthem to the worse.\n\n\"Men looked for battle again the next day; but it fell not out so; for\nthe host of the Burg saw that there was more to lose than to gain, so\nthey drew back towards their own place.  Neither did they waste the\nland much; for the riders of the Dry Tree followed hard at heel, and\ncut off all who tarried, or strayed from the main battle.\n\n\"When they were gone, then at last did the Wheat-wearers give\nthemselves up to the joy of their deliverance and the pleasure of their\nnew lives: and one of their old men that I have spoken with told me\nthis; that before when they were little better than the thralls of the\nBurg, and durst scarce raise a hand against the foemen, the carles were\nbut slow to love, and the queans, for all their fairness, cold and but\nlittle kind.  However, now in the fields of the wheat-wearers\nthemselves all this was changed, and men and maids took to arraying\nthemselves gaily as occasion served, and there was singing and dancing\non every green, and straying of couples amongst the greenery of the\nsummer night; and in short the god of love was busy in the land, and\nmade the eyes seem bright, and the lips sweet, and the bosom fair, and\nthe arms sleek and the feet trim:  so that every hour was full of\nallurement; and ever the nigher that war and peril was, the more\ndelight had man and maid of each other's bodies.\n\n\"Well, within a while the Wheat-wearers were grown so full of hope that\nthey bade the men of the Dry Tree lead them against the Burg of the\nFour Friths, and the Champions were ready thereto; because they wotted\nwell, that, Hampton being disgarnished of men, the men of the Burg\nmight fall on it; and even if they took it not, they would beset all\nways and make riding a hard matter for their fellowship.  So they fell\nto, wisely and deliberately, and led an host of the best of the carles\nwith them, and bade the women keep their land surely, so that their\nhost was not a great many.  But so wisely they led them that they came\nbefore the Burg well-nigh unawares; and though it seemed little likely\nthat they should take so strong a place, yet nought less befell.  For\nthe Burg-dwellers beset with cruelty and bitter anger cried out that\nnow at last they would make an end of this cursed people, and the\nwhoreson strong-thieves their friends: so they went out a-gates a great\nmultitude, but in worser order than their wont was; and there befell\nthat marvel which sometimes befalleth even to very valiant men, that\nnow at the pinch all their valour flowed from them, and they fled\nbefore the spears had met, and in such evil order that the gates could\nnot be shut, and their foemen entered with them slaying and slaying\neven as they would.  So that in an hour's space the pride and the\nestate of the Burg of the Four Friths was utterly fallen.  Huge was the\nslaughter; for the Wheat-wearers deemed they had many a grief whereof\nto avenge them; nor were the men of the Dry Tree either sluggards or\nsaints to be careless of their foemen, or to be merciful in the battle:\nbut at last the murder was stayed: and then the men of the\nWheat-wearers went from house to house in the town to find the women of\ntheir folk who had been made thralls by the Burgers.  There then was\nmany a joyful meeting betwixt those poor women and the men of their\nkindred: all was forgotten now of the days of their thralldom, their\ntoil and mocking and stripes; and within certain days all the sort of\nthem came before the host clad in green raiment, and garlanded with\nflowers for the joy of their deliverance; and great feast was made to\nthem.\n\n\"As for them of the Burg, the battle and chase over, no more were\nslain, save that certain of the great ones were made shorter by the\nhead.  But the Champions and the Wheat-wearers both, said that none of\nthat bitter and cruel folk should abide any longer in the town; so that\nafter a delay long enough for them to provide stuff for their\nwayfaring, they were all thrust out a-gates, rich and poor, old and\nyoung, man, woman and child.  Proudly and with a stout countenance they\nwent, for now was their valour come again to them.  And it is like that\nwe shall hear of them oft again; for though they had but a few weapons\namongst them when they were driven out of their old home, and neither\nhauberk nor shield nor helm, yet so learned in war be they and so\nmarvellous great of pride, that they will somehow get them weapons; and\neven armed but with headless staves, and cudgels of the thicket, woe\nbetide the peaceful folk whom they shall first fall on.  Yea, fair sir,\nthe day shall come meseemeth when folk shall call on thee to lead the\nhunt after these famished wolves, and when thou dost so, call on me to\ntell thee tales of their doings which shall make thine heart hard, and\nthine hand heavy against them.\"\n\n\"Meantime,\" said Ralph, \"what has betid to the Fellowship of the Dry\nTree?  for I see that thou hast some grief on thy mind because of them.\"\n\nRoger kept silence a little and then he said:  \"I grieve because\nHampton is no more a strong place of warriors; two or three carles and\na dozen of women dwell now in the halls and chambers of the Scaur.\nHere on earth, all endeth.  God send us to find the world without end!\"\n\n\"What then,\" said Ralph, \"have they then had another great overthrow,\nworse than that other?\"  \"Nay,\" said Roger doggedly, \"it is not so.\"\n\"But where is the Fellowship?\" said Ralph.  \"It is scattered abroad,\"\nquoth Roger.  \"For some of the Dry Tree had no heart to leave the women\nwhom they had wooed in the Wheat-wearer's land: and some, and a great\nmany, have taken their dears to dwell in the Burg of the Four Friths,\nwhereas a many of the Wheat-wearers have gone to beget children on the\nold bondwomen of the Burgers; of whom there were some two thousand\nalive after the Burg was taken; besides that many women also came with\nthe carles from their own land.\n\n\"So that now a mixed folk are dwelling in the Burg, partly of those\nwomen-thralls, partly of carles and queans come newly from the\nWheat-wearers, partly of men of our Fellowship the more part of whom\nare wedded to queans of the Wheat-wearers, and partly of men, chapmen\nand craftsmen and others who have drifted into the town, having heard\nthat there is no lack of wealth there, and many fair women unmated.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and is all this so ill?\"  Said Roger, \"Meseems it\nis ill enough that there is no longer, rightly said, a Fellowship of\nthe Dry Tree, though the men be alive who were once of that\nfellowship.\" \"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"and why should they not make a new\nfellowship in the Burg, whereas they may well be peaceful, since they\nhave come to their above of their foemen?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Roger slowly, \"that is sooth; and so is this, that there in\nthe Burg they are a strong band, with a captain of their own, and much\nworshipped of the peaceful folk; and moreover, though they be not cruel\nto torment helpless folk, or hard to make an end of all joy to-day,\nlest they lose their joy to-morrow, they now array all men in good\norder within the Burg, so that it shall be no easier for a foeman to\nwin that erst it was.\"\n\n\"What, man!\" said Ralph, \"then be of better cheer, and come thou with\nus, and may be the old steel of the champions may look on the sun down\nin Upmeads.  Come thou with me, I say, and show me and my luck to some\nof thy fellows who are dwelling in the Burg, and it may be when thou\nhast told my tale to them, that some of them shall be content to leave\ntheir beds cold for a while, that they may come help a Friend of the\nWell in his need.\"\n\nRoger sat silent as if he were pondering the matter, while Richard and\nthe Sage, both of them, took up the word one after the other, and urged\nhim to it.\n\nAt last he said:  \"Well, so be it for this adventure.  Only I say not\nthat I shall give up this hermitage and my holiness for ever.  Come\nthou aside, wise man of Swevenham, and I shall tell thee wherefore.\"\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, laughing, \"and when he hath told thee, tell me not\nagain; for sure I am that he is right to go with us, and belike shall\nbe wrong in his reason therefore.\"\n\nRoger looked a little askance at him, and he went without doors with\nthe Sage, and when they were out of earshot, he said to him: \"Hearken,\nI would have gone with my lord at the first word, and have been fain\nthereof; but there is this woman that followeth him.  At every turn she\nshall mind me of our Lady that was; and I shall loath her, and her\nfairness and the allurements of her body, because I see of her, that\nshe it is that hath gotten my Lady's luck, and that but for her my Lady\nmight yet have been alive.\"\n\nSaid the Sage:  \"Well quoth my lord that thou wouldst give me a fool's\nreason!  What! dost not thou know, thou that knowest so much of the\nLady of Abundance, that she it was who ordained this Ursula to be\nRalph's bedmate, when she herself should be gone from him, were she\ndead or alive, and that she also should be a Friend of the Well, so\nthat he might not lack a fellow his life long?  But this thou sayest,\nnot knowing the mind of our Lady, and how she loved him in her inmost\nheart.\"\n\nRoger hung his head and spake not for a while, and then he said: \"Well,\nwise man, I have said that I will go on this adventure, and I will\nsmooth my tongue for this while at least, and for what may come\nhereafter, let it be.  And now we were best get to horse; for what with\nmeat and minstrelsy, we have worn away the day till it wants but a\nlittle of noon.  Go tell thy lord that I am ready.  Farewell peace, and\nwelcome war and grudging!\"\n\nSo the Sage went within, and came out with the others, and they mounted\ntheir horses anon, and Roger went ahead on foot, and led them through\nthe thicket-ways without fumbling; and they lay down that night on the\nfarther side of the Swelling Flood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nA Change of Days in the Burg of the Four Friths\n\n\nThere is naught to tell of their ways till they came out of the thicket\ninto the fields about the Burg of the Four Friths; and even there was a\nlook of a bettering of men's lives; though forsooth the husbandmen\nthere were much the same as had abided in the fields aforetime, whereas\nthey were not for the most part freemen of the Burg, but aliens who did\nservice in war and otherwise thereto.  But, it being eventide, there\nwere men and women and children, who had come out of gates, walking\nabout and disporting themselves in the loveliness of early summer, and\nthat in far merrier guise than they had durst do in the bygone days.\nMoreover, there was scarce a sword or spear to be seen amongst them,\nwhereat Roger grudged somewhat, and Richard said:  \"Meseems this folk\ntrusts the peace of the Burg overmuch since, when all is told, unpeace\nis not so far from their borders.\"\n\nBut as they drew a little nigher Ralph pointed out to his fellows the\ngleam of helms and weapons on the walls, and they saw a watchman on\neach of the high towers of the south gate; and then quoth Roger: \"Nay,\nthe Burg will not be won so easily; and if a few fools get themselves\nslain outside it is no great matter.\"\n\nFolk nowise let them come up to the gate unheeded, but gathered about\nthem to look at the newcomers, but not so as to hinder them, and they\ncould see that these summerers were goodly folk enough, and demeaned\nthem as though they had but few troubles weighing on them.  But the\nwayfarers were not unchallenged at the gate, for a stout man-at-arms\nstayed them and said: \"Ye ride somewhat late, friends.  What are ye?\"\nQuoth Ralph: \"We be peaceful wayfarers save to them that would fall on\nus, and we seek toward Upmeads.\"  \"Yea?\" said the man, \"belike ye shall\nfind something less than peace betwixt here and Upmeads, for rumour\ngoes that there are alien riders come into the lands of Higham, and for\naught I know the said unpeace may spread further on.  Well if ye will\ngo to the Flower de Luce and abide there this night, ye shall have a\nlet-pass to-morn betimes.\"\n\nThen Ralph spake a word in Roger's ear, and Roger nodded his head, and,\nthrowing his cowl aback, went up to the man-at-arms and said: \"Stephen\na-Hurst, hast thou time for a word with an old friend?\" \"Yea, Roger,\"\nsaid the man \"is it verily thou?  I deemed that thou hadst fled away\nfrom all of us to live in the wilds.\"\n\n\"So it was, lad,\" said Roger, \"but times change from good to bad and\nback again; and now am I of this good lord's company; and I shall tell\nthee, Stephen, that though he rideth but few to-day, yet merry shall he\nbe that rideth with him to-morrow if unpeace be in the land.  Lo you,\nStephen, this is the Child of Upmeads, whom belike thou hast heard of;\nand if thou wilt take me into the chamber of thy tower, I will tell\nthee things of him that thou wottest not.\"\n\nStephen turned to Ralph and made obeisance to him and said: \"Fair Sir,\nthere are tales going about concerning thee, some whereof are strange\nenow, but none of them ill; and I deem by the look of thee that thou\nshalt be both a stark champion and a good lord; and I deem that it\nshall be my good luck, if I see more of thee, and much more.  Now if\nthou wilt, pass on with thine other fellows to the Flower de Luce, and\nleave this my old fellow-in-arms with me, and he shall tell me of thy\nmind; for I see that thou wouldest have somewhat of us; and since, I\ndoubt not by the looks of thee, that thou wilt not bid us aught\nunknightly, when we know thy will, we shall try to pleasure thee.\"\n\n\"Yea, Lord Ralph,\" said Roger, \"thou mayest leave all the business with\nme, and I will come to thee not later than betimes to-morrow, and let\nthee wot how matters have sped.  And methinks ye may hope to wend\nout-a-gates this time otherwise than thou didest before.\"\n\nSo Ralph gave him yeasay and thanked the man-at-arms and rode his ways\nwith the others toward the Flower de Luce, and whereas the sun was but\nnewly set, Ralph noted that the booths were gayer and the houses\nbrighter and more fairly adorned than aforetimes.  As for the folk,\nthey were such that the streets seemed full of holiday makers, so\njoyous and well dight were they; and the women like to those fair\nthralls whom he had seen that other time, saving that they were not\nclad so wantonly, however gaily.  They came into the great square, and\nthere they saw that the masons and builders had begun on the master\nchurch to make it fairer and bigger; the people were sporting there as\nin the streets, and amongst them were some weaponed men, but the most\npart of these bore the token of the Dry Tree.\n\nSo they entered the Flower de Luce, and had good welcome there, as if\nthey were come home to their own house; for when its people saw such a\ngoodly old man in the Sage, and so stout and trim a knight as was\nRichard, and above all when they beheld the loveliness of Ralph and\nUrsula, they praised them open-mouthed, and could scarce make enough of\nthem.  And when they had had their meat and were rested came two of the\nmaids there and asked them if it were lawful to talk with them; and\nRalph laughed and bade them sit by them, and eat a dainty morsel; and\nthey took that blushing, for they were fair and young, and Ralph's face\nand the merry words of his mouth stirred the hearts within them: and\nforsooth it was not so much they that spake as Ursula and the Sage; for\nRalph was somewhat few spoken, whereas he pondered concerning the\ncoming days, and what he half deemed that he saw a-doing at Upmeads.\nBut at last they found their tongues, and said how that already rumour\nwas abroad that they were in the Burg who had drunk of the Water of the\nWell at the World's End; and said one: \"It is indeed a fair sight to\nsee you folk coming back in triumph; and so methinks will many deem if\nye abide with us over to-morrow, and yet, Lady, for a while we are\nwell-nigh as joyous as ye can be, whereas we have but newly come into\nnew life also: some of us from very thralldom of the most grievous, and\nI am of those; and some of us in daily peril of it, like to my sister\nhere.  So mayhappen,\" said she, smiling, \"none of us shall seek to the\nWell until we have worn our present bliss a little threadbare.\"\n\nUrsula smiled on her, but the Sage said:  \"Mayhappen it is of no avail\nspeaking of such things to a young and fair woman; but what would\nbetide you if the old Burgers were to come back and win their walls\nagain?\"  The maid who had been a thrall changed countenance at his\nword; but the other one said: \"If the Burgers come back, they will find\nthem upon the walls who have already chaced them.  Thou mayst deem me\nslim and tender, old wise man; but such as mine arm is, it has upheaved\nthe edges against the foe; and if it be a murder to slay a Burger, then\nam I worthy of the gallows.\"  \"Yea, yea,\" quoth Richard, laughing, \"ye\nshall be double-manned then in this good town: ye may well win, unless\nthe sight of you shall make the foe over fierce for the gain.\"\n\nSaid the Sage \"It is well, maiden, and if ye hold to that, and keep\nyour carles in the same road, ye need not to fear the Burgers: and to\nsay sooth, I have it in my mind, that before long ye shall have both\nwar and victory.\"\n\nThen Ralph seemed to wake up as from a dream, and he arose, and said:\n\"Thou art in the right, Sage, and to mine eyes it seemeth that both\nthou and I shall be sharers in the war and the victory.\" And therewith\nhe fell to striding up and down the hall, while the two maidens sat\ngazing on him with gleaming eyes and flushed cheeks.\n\nBut in a little while he came back to his seat and sat him down, and\nfell to talk with the women, and asked them of the town and the\nbuilding therein, and the markets, whether they throve; and they and\ntwo or three of the townsmen or merchants answered all, and told him\nhow fair their estate was, and how thriving was the lot of one and all\nwith them.  Therewith was Ralph well pleased, and they sat talking\nthere in good fellowship till the night was somewhat worn, and all men\nfared to bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nRalph Sees Hampton and the Scaur\n\n\nWhen it was morning Ralph arose and went into the hall of the hostelry,\nand even as he entered it the outside door opened, and in came Roger,\nand Richard with him (for he had been astir very early) and Roger, who\nwas armed from head to foot and wore a coat of the Dry Tree, cried out:\n\"Now, Lord, thou wert best do on thy war-gear, for thou shalt presently\nbe captain of an host.\"  \"Yea, Roger,\" quoth Ralph, \"and hast thou done\nwell?\" \"Well enough,\" said Richard; \"thine host shall not be a great\none, but no man in it will be a blencher, for they be all champions of\nthe Dry Tree.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth Roger, \"so it was that Stephen a-Hurst brought me to a\ncompany of my old fellows, and we went all of us together to the\nCaptain of the Burg (e'en he of the Dry Tree, who in these latest days\nis made captain of all), and did him to wit that thou hadst a need; and\nwhereas he, as all of us, had heard of the strokes that thou struckest\nin the wood that day when thy happiness first began, (woe worth the\nwhile!) he stickled not to give some of us leave to look on the\nhand-play with thee.  But soft, my Lord! abound not in thanks as yet,\ntill I tell thee.  The said Captain hath gotten somewhat of the mind of\na chapman by dwelling in a town, 'tis like (the saints forgive me for\nsaying so!) and would strike a bargain with thee.\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph,\nsmiling, \"I partly guess what like the bargain is; but say thou.\"\n\nSaid Roger:  \"I like not his bargain, not for thy sake but mine own;\nthis it is, that we shall ride, all of us who are to be of thy\nfellowship, to the Castle of the Scaur to-day, and there thy Lady shall\nsit in the throne whereas in past days our Lady and Queen was wont to\nsit; and that thou shalt swear upon her head, that whensoever he\nbiddeth thee come to the help of the Burg of the Four Friths and the\ntribes of the Wheat-wearers, thou shalt come in arms by the straightest\nroad with such fellowship as thou mayst gather; and if thou wilt so do,\nwe of the Dry Tree who go with thee on this journey are thine to save\nor to spend by flood or field, or castle wall, amidst the edges and the\nshafts and the fire-flaught. What sayest thou--thou who art lucky, and\nhast of late become wise?  And I will tell thee, that though I hope it\nnot, yet I would thou shouldst naysay it; for it will be hard for me to\nsee another woman sitting in our Lady's seat: yea, to see her sitting\nthere, who hath stolen her luck.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Now this proffer of the Captain's I call friendly and\nknightly, and I will gladly swear as he will; all the more as without\nany oath I should never fail him whensoever he may send for me.  As for\nthee, Roger, ride with us if thou wilt, and thou shalt be welcome both\nin the company, and at the High House of Upmeads whenso we come there.\"\n\nThen was Roger silent, but nowise abashed; and as they spoke they heard\nthe tramp of horses and the clash of weapons, and they saw through the\nopen door three men-at-arms riding up to the house; so Ralph went out\nto welcome them; they were armed full well in bright armour, and their\ncoats were of the Dry Tree, and were tall men and warrior-like. They\nhailed Ralph as captain, and he gave them the sele of the day and bade\ncome in and drink a cup; so did they, but they were scarce off their\nhorses ere there came another three, and then six together, and so one\nafter other till the hall of the Flower de Luce was full of the gleam\nof steel and clash of armour, and the lads held their horses without\nand were merry with the sight of the stalwart men-at-arms.  Now cometh\nUrsula down from her chamber clad in her bravery; and when they saw her\nthey set up a shout for joy of her, so that the rafters rang again; but\nshe laughed for pleasure of them, and poured them out the wine, till\nthey were merrier with the sight of her than with the good liquor.\n\nNow Roger comes to Ralph and tells him that he deems his host hath come\nto the last man.  Then Ralph armed him, and those two maidens brought\nhim his horse, and they mount all of them and draw up in the Square;\nand Roger and Stephen a-Hurst array them, for they were chosen of them\nas leaders along with Ralph, and Richard, whom they all knew, at least\nby hearsay.  Then Roger drew from his pouch a parchment, and read the\nroll of names, and there was no man lacking, and they were threescore\nsave five, besides Roger and the way-farers, and never was a band of\nlike number seen better; and Richard said softly unto Ralph:  \"If we\nhad a few more of these, I should care little what foemen we should\nmeet in Upmeads:  soothly, my lord, they had as well have ridden into\nred Hell as into our green fields.\" \"Fear not, Richard,\" said Ralph,\n\"we shall have enough.\"\n\nSo then they rode out of the Square and through the streets to the\nNorth Gate, and much folk was abroad to look on them, and they blessed\nthem as they went, both carles and queans; for the rumour was toward\nthat there was riding a good and dear Lord and a Friend of the Well to\nget his own again from out of the hands of the aliens.\n\nHerewith they ride a little trot through the Freedom of the Burg, and\nwhen they were clear of it they turned aside from the woodland highway\nwhereon Ralph had erst ridden with Roger and followed the rides a good\nway till it was past noon, when they came into a very close thicket\nwhere there was but a narrow and winding way whereon two men might not\nride abreast, and Roger said: \"Now, if we were the old Burgers, and the\nDry Tree still holding the Scaur, we should presently know what\nsteel-point dinner meaneth; if the dead could rise out of their graves\nto greet their foemen, we should anon be a merry company here.  But at\nlast they learned the trick, and were wont to fetch a compass round\nabout Grey Goose Thicket as it hight amongst us.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ralph, \"but how if there by any waylaying us; the Burgers\nmay be wiser still than thou deemest, and ye may have learned them more\nthan thou art minded to think.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Roger, \"I bade a half score turn aside by the thicket path\non our left hands; that shall make all sure; but indeed I look for no\nlurkers as yet.  In a month's time that may betide, but not yet; not\nyet.  But tell me, fair Sir, have ye any deeming of where thou mayst\nget thee more folk who be not afraid of the hard hand-play? For Richard\nhath been telling me that there be tidings in the air.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"If hope play me not false, I look to gather some stout\ncarles of the Shepherd Country.\"  \"Yea,\" said Roger, \"but I shall tell\nthee that they have been at whiles unfriends of the Dry Tree.\"  Said\nRalph: \"I think they will be friends unto me.\"  \"Then it shall do\nwell,\" said Roger, \"for they be good in a fray.\"\n\nSo talked they as they rode, but ever Roger would give no heed to\nUrsula.  but made as if he wotted not that she was there, though ever\nand anon Ralph would be turning back to speak to her and help her\nthrough the passes.\n\nAt last the thicket began to dwindle, and presently riding out of a\nlittle valley or long trench on to a ridge nearly bare of trees, they\nsaw below them a fair green plain, and in the midst of it a great heap\nof grey rocks rising out of it like a reef out of the sea, and on the\nsaid reef, and climbing up as it were to the topmost of it, the white\nwalls of a great castle, the crown whereof was a huge round tower.  At\nthe foot of the ridge was a thorp of white houses thatched with straw\nscattered over a good piece of the plain.  The company drew rein on the\nridge-top, and the Champions raised a great shout at the sight of their\nold strong-place; and Roger turned to Ralph and said:  \"Fair Sir, how\ndeemest thou of the Castle of the Scaur?\" but Richard broke in: \"For my\npart, friend Roger, I deem that ye do like to people unlearned in war\nto leave the stronghold ungarnished of men.  This is a fool's deed.\"\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Roger, \"we need not be over-hasty, while it is our\nchief business to order the mingled folk of the Wheat-wearers and\nothers who dwell in the Burg as now.\"\n\nThen spake Ralph:  \"Yet how wilt thou say but that the foemen whom we\ngo to meet in Upmeads may be some of those very Burgers:  hast thou\nheard whether they have found a new dwelling among some unhappy folk,\nor be still roving: maybe they shall deem Upmeads fair.\"\n\nSpake Michael a-Hurst: \"By thy leave, fair Sir, we have had a word of\nthose riders and strong-thieves that they have fetched a far compass,\nand got them armour, and be come into the woodland north of the Wood\nDebateable.  For like all strong-thieves, they love the wood.\"\n\nRoger laughed:  \"Yea, as we did, friend Michael, when we were thieves;\nwhereas now we be lords and gentlemen.  But as to thy tidings, I set\nnot much by them; for of the same message was this word that they had\nalready fallen on Higham by the Way; and we know that this cannot be\ntrue; since though forsooth the Abbot has had unpeace on his hands, we\nknow where his foemen came from, the West to wit, and the Banded\nBarons.\"\n\n\"Yea, yea,\" quoth the Sage, \"but may not the Burgers have taken service\nwith them?\"  \"Yea, forsooth,\" quoth Roger, \"but I deem not, or we had\nbeen surer thereof.\"\n\nThus they spake, and they lighted down all of them to breathe their\nhorses, and Ursula spake with Ralph as they walked the greensward\ntogether a little apart, and said: \"Sweetheart, I am afraid of to-day.\"\n\n\"Yea, dear,\" said he, \"and wherefore?\"  She said: \"It will be hard for\nme to enter that grim house yonder, and sit in the seat whence I was\nerewhile threatened by the evil hag with hair like a grey she-bear.\"\n\nHe made much of her and said:  \"Yet belike a Friend of the Well may\novercome this also; and withal the hall shall be far other to-day when\nit was.\"\n\nShe looked about on the warriors as they lay on the grass or loitered\nby their horses; then she smiled, and her face lightened, and she\nreddened and cast down her eyes and said: \"Yea, that is sooth; that day\nthere were few men in the hall, and they old and evil of semblance.  It\nwas a band of women who took me in the thorp and brought me up into the\nCastle, and mishandled me there, and cast me into prison there; whereas\nthese be good fellows, and frank and free of aspect.  But O, my heart,\nlook thou how fearful the piled-up rocks rise from the plain and the\nwalls wind up amongst them; and that huge tower, the crown of all!\nSurely there is none more fearful in the world.\"\n\nHe kissed her and laughed merrily, and said:  \"Yea, sweetheart, and\nthere will be another change in the folk of the hall when we come there\nthis time, to wit, that thou shouldst not be alone therein, even were\nall these champions, and Richard and the Sage away from thee.  Wilt\nthou tell me how that shall be?\"\n\nShe turned to him and kissed him and caressed him, and then they turned\nback again toward their fellows, for by now they had walked together a\ngood way along the ridge.\n\nSo then they gat to horse again and rode into the thorp, where men and\nwomen stood about to behold them, and made them humble reverence as\nthey passed by.  So rode they to the bailly of the Castle; and if that\nstronghold looked terrible from the ridge above, tenfold more terrible\nof aspect it was when the upper parts were hidden by the grey rocks,\nand they so huge and beetling, and though the sun was bright about\nthem, and they in the midst of their friends, yet even Ralph felt\nsomewhat of dread creep over him: yet he smiled cheerfully as Ursula\nturned an anxious face on him.  They alighted from their horses in the\nbailly, for over steep for horse-hoofs was the walled way upward; and\nas they began to mount, even the merry Champions hushed their holiday\nclamour for awe of the huge stronghold, and Ralph took Ursula by the\nhand, and she sidled up to him, and said softly:  \"Yea, it was here\nthey drave me up, those women, thrusting and smiting me; and some would\nhave stripped off my raiment, but one who seemed the wisest, said,\n'Nay, leave her till she come before the ancient Lady, for her gear may\nbe a token of whence she is, and whither, if she be come as a spy.'  So\nI escaped them for that moment.  And now I wonder what we shall find in\nthe hall when we come in thither.  It is somewhat like to me, as when\none gets up from bed in the dead night, when all is quiet and the moon\nis shining, and goes out of the chamber into the hall, and coming back,\nalmost dreads to see some horror lying in one's place amid the familiar\nbedclothes.\"\n\nAnd she grew paler as she spake.  Then Ralph comforted her and trimmed\nhis countenance to a look of mirth, but inwardly he was ill at ease.\n\nSo up they went and up, till they came to a level place whereon was\nbuilt the chief hall and its chambers:  there they stood awhile to\nbreathe them before the door, which was rather low than great; and\nUrsula clung to Ralph and trembled, but Ralph spake in her ear: \"Take\nheart, my sweet, or these men, and Roger in especial, will think the\nworse of thee; and thou a Friend of the Well.  What! here is naught to\nhurt thee! this is naught beside the perils of the desert, and the\nslaves and the evil lord of Utterbol.\" \"Yea,\" she said, \"but meseemeth\nI loved thee not so sore as now I do.  O friend, I am become a weak\nwoman and unvaliant, and there is naught in me but love of thee, and\nlove of life because of thee; nor dost thou know altogether what befell\nme in that hall.\"\n\nBut Ralph turned about and cried out in a loud, cheerful voice: \"Let us\nenter, friends! and lo you, I will show the Champions of the Dry Tree\nthe way into their own hall and high place.\" Therewith he thrust the\ndoor open, for it was not locked, and strode into the hall, still\nleading Ursula by the hand, and all the company followed him, the clash\nof their armour resounding through the huge building.  Though it was\nlong, it was not so much that it was long as that it was broad, and\nexceeding high, so that in the dusk of it the great vault of the roof\nwas dim and misty.  There was no man therein, no halling on its walls,\nno benches nor boards, naught but the great standing table of stone on\nthe dais, and the stone high-seat amidst of it: and the place did\nverily seem like the house and hall of a people that had died out in\none hour because of their evil deeds.\n\nThey stood still a moment when they were all fairly within doors, and\nRoger thrust up to Ralph and said, but softly:  \"The woman is\nblenching, and all for naught; were it not for the oath, we had best\nhave left her in the thorp: I fear me she will bring evil days on our\nold home with her shivering fear.  How far otherwise came our Lady in\nhither when first she came amongst us, when the Duke of us found her in\nthe wood after she had been thrust out from Sunway by the Baron whom\nthou slewest afterward.  Our Duke brought her in hither wrapped up in\nhis knight's scarlet cloak, and went up with her on to the dais; but\nwhen she came thither, she turned about and let her cloak fall to\nearth, and stood there barefoot in her smock, as she had been cast out\ninto the wildwood, and she spread abroad her hands, and cried out in a\nloud voice as sweet as the May blackbird, 'May God bless this House and\nthe abode of the valiant, and the shelter of the hapless.'\"\n\nSaid Ursula (and her voice was firm and the colour come back to her\ncheeks now, while Ralph stood agaze and wondering): \"Roger, thou lovest\nme little, meseemeth, though if I did less than I do, I should do\nagainst the will of thy Lady that was Queen in this hall.  But tell me,\nRoger, where is gone that other one, the fearful she-bear of this crag,\nwho sat in yonder stone high-seat, and roared at me and mocked me, and\ngave me over into the hands of her tormentors, who haled me away to the\nprison wherefrom thy very Lady delivered me?\"\n\n\"Lady,\" said Roger, \"the tale of her is short since the day thou sawest\nher herein.  On the day when we first had the evil tidings of the\nslaying of my Lady we were sad at heart, and called to mind ancient\ntransgressions against us; therefore we fell on the she-bear, as thou\ncallest her, and her company of men and women, and some we slew and\nsome we thrust forth; but as to her, I slew her not three feet from\nwhere thou standest now.  A rumour there is that she walketh, and it\nmay be so; yet in the summer noon ye need not look to see her.\"\n\nRalph said coldly:  \"Roger, let us be done with minstrels' tales; lead\nme to the place where the oath is to be sworn, for time presses.\"\n\nScarce were the words out of his mouth ere Roger strode forward and gat\nhim on to the dais and went hastily to the wall behind the high-seat,\nwhence he took down a very great horn, and set it to his lips and\nwinded it loudly thrice, so that the great and high hall was full of\nits echoes.  Richard started thereat and half drew his sword; but the\nSage put his hand upon the hilts, and said:  \"It is naught, let the\nedges lie quiet.\" Ursula stared astonished, but now she quaked no more;\nRalph changed not countenance a wit, and the champions of the Tree made\nas if naught had been done that they looked not for.  But thereafter\ncried Roger from the dais: \"This is the token that the men of the Dry\nTree are met for matters of import; thus is the Mote hallowed.  Come up\nhither, ye aliens, and ye also of the fellowship, that the oath may be\nsworn, and we may go our ways, even as the alien captain biddeth.\"\n\nThen Ralph took Ursula's hand again, and went up the hall calmly and\nproudly, and the champions followed with Richard and the Sage.  Ralph\nand Ursula went up on to the dais, and he set down Ursula in the stone\nhigh-seat, and even in the halldusk a right fair-coloured picture she\nlooked therein; for she was clad in a goodly green gown broidered with\nflowers, and a green cloak with gold orphreys over it; her hair was\nspread abroad over her shoulders, and on her head was a garland of\nroses which the women of the Flower de Luce had given her; so there she\nsat with her fair face, whence now all the wrinkles of trouble and fear\nwere smoothed out, looking like an image of the early summer-tide\nitself.  And the champions looked on her and marvelled, and one\nwhispered to the other that it was their Lady of aforetime come back\nagain; only Roger, who had now gone back to the rest of the fellowship,\ncast his eyes upon the ground, and muttered.\n\nNow Ralph draws his sword, and lays it naked on the stone table, and he\nstood beside Ursula and said:  \"Champions of the Dry Tree, by the blade\nof Upmeads which lieth here before me, and by the head which I love\nbest in the world, and is best worthy of love\" (and herewith he laid\nhis hand on Ursula's head), \"I swear that whensoever the Captain of the\nDry Tree calleth on me, whether I be eating or drinking, abed or\nstanding on my feet, at peace or at war, glad or sorry, I shall do my\nutmost to come to his aid straightway with whatso force I may gather.\nIs this rightly sworn, Champions?\"\n\nSaid Stephen a-Hurst: \"It is sworn well and knightly, and now cometh\nour oath.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"I had no mind to drive a bargain with you; your\ndeeds shall prove you; and I fear not for your doughtiness.\"\n\nSaid Stephen:  \"Yea, Lord; but he bade us swear to thee.  Reach me thy\nsword, I pray thee.\"\n\nThen Ralph reached him his sword across the great stone table, and\nStephen took it, and kissed the blade and the hilts; and then lifted up\nhis voice and said:  \"By the hilts and the blade, by the point and the\nedge, we swear to follow the Lord Ralph of Upmeads for a year and a\nday, and to do his will in all wise.  So help us God and Allhallows!\"\n\nAnd therewith he gave the sword to the others, and each man of them\nkissed it as he had.\n\nBut Ralph said:  \"Champions, for this oath I thank you all heartily.\nBut it is not my meaning that I should hold you by me for a year,\nwhereas I deem I shall do all that my kindred may need in three days'\nspace from the first hour wherein we set foot in Upmeads.\"\n\nStephen smiled friendly at him and nodded, and said:  \"That may well\nbe; but now to make a good end of this mote I will tell thee a thing;\nto wit, that our Captain, yea, and all we, are minded to try thee by\nthis fray in Upmeads, now we know that thou hast become a Friend of the\nWell.  And if thou turn out as we deem is likest, we will give thee\nthis Castle of the Scaur, for thee and those that shall spring from thy\nloins; for we deem that some such man as thou will be the only one to\nhold it worthily, and in such wise as it may be a stronghold against\ntyrants and for the helping of peaceable folk; since forsooth, we of\nthe Dry Tree have heard somewhat of the Well at the World's End, and\ntrow in the might thereof.\"\n\nHe made an end; and Ralph kept silence and pondered the matter.  But\nRoger lifted up his head and broke in, and said:  \"Yea, yea! that is\nit: we are all become men of peace, we riders of the Dry Tree!\" And he\nlaughed withal, but as one nowise best pleased.\n\nBut as Ralph was gathering his words together, and Ursula was looking\nup to him with trouble in her face again, came a man of the thorp\nrushing into the hall, and cried out: \"O, my lords! there are weaponed\nmen coming forth from the thicket.  Save us, we pray you, for we are\nill-weaponed and men of peace.\"\n\nRoger laughed, and said:  \"Eh, good man!  So ye want us back again?\nBut my Lord Ralph, and thou Richard, and thou Stephen, come ye to the\nshot-window here, that giveth on to the forest.  We are high up here,\nand we shall see all as clearly as in a good mirror.  Hast thou shut\nthe gates, carle?\"  \"Yea, Lord Roger,\" quoth he, \"and there are some\nfifty of us together down in the base-court.\"\n\nRalph and Richard and Stephen looked forth from the shot window, and\nsaw verily a band of men riding down the bent into the thorp, and\nRalph, who as aforesaid was far-sighted and clear-sighted, said: \"Yea,\nit is strange:  but without doubt these are riders of the Dry Tree; and\nthey seem to me to be some ten-score. Thou Stephen, thou Roger, what is\nto hand?  Is your Captain wont to give a gift and take it back...and\nsomewhat more with it?\"  Stephen looked abashed at his word; and Roger\nhung his head again.\n\nBut therewith the Sage drew up to them and said:  \"Be not dismayed,\nLord Ralph.  What wert thou going to say to the Champions when this\ncarle brake in?\"\n\n\"This,\" said Ralph, \"that I thanked the Dry Tree heartily for its gift,\nbut that meseemed it naught wise to leave this stronghold disgarnished\nof men till I can come or send back from Upmeads.\"\n\nStephen's face cleared at the word, and he said:  \"I bid thee believe\nit, lord, that there is no treason in our Captain's heart; and that if\nthere were I would fight against him and his men on thy behalf.\"  And\nRoger, though in a somewhat surly voice, said the like.\n\nRalph thought a little, and then he said:  \"It is well; go we down and\nout of gates to meet them, that we may the sooner get on our way to\nUpmeads.\" And without more words he went up to Ursula and took her hand\nand went out of the hall, and down the rock-cut stair, and all they\nwith him.  And when they came into the Base-court, Ralph spoke to the\ncarles of the thorp, who stood huddled together sore afeard, and said:\n\"Throw open the gates.  These riders who have so scared you are naught\nelse than the Champions of the Dry Tree who are coming back to their\nstronghold that they may keep you sure against wicked tyrants who would\noppress you.\"\n\nThe carles looked askance at one another, but straightway opened the\ngates, and Ralph and his company went forth, and abode the new-comers\non a little green mound half a bowshot from the Castle.  Ralph sat down\non the grass and Ursula by him, and she said: \"My heart tells me that\nthese Champions are no traitors, however rough and fierce they have\nbeen, and still shall be if occasion serve.  But O, sweetheart, how\ndear and sweet is this sunlit greensward after yonder grim hold.\nSurely, sweet, it shall never be our dwelling?\"\n\n\"I wot not, beloved,\" said he; \"must we not go and dwell where deeds\nshall lead us? and the hand of Weird is mighty.  But lo thou, here are\nthe newcomers to hand!\"\n\nSo it was as he said, and presently the whole band came before them,\nand they were all of the Dry Tree, stout men and well weaponed, and\nthey had ridden exceeding fast, so that their horses were somewhat\nspent.  A tall man very gallantly armed, who rode at their head, leapt\nat once from his horse and came up to Ralph and hailed him, and Roger\nand Stephen both made obeisance to him.  Ralph, who had risen up,\nhailed him in his turn, and the tall man said:  \"I am the Captain of\nthe Dry Tree for lack of a better; art thou Ralph of Upmeads, fair\nsir?\" \"Even so,\" said Ralph.\n\nSaid the Captain:  \"Thou wilt marvel that I have ridden after thee on\nthe spur; so here is the tale shortly.  Your backs were not turned on\nthe walls of the Burg an hour, ere three of my riders brought in to me\na man who said, and gave me tokens of his word being true, that he had\nfallen in with a company of the old Burgers in the Wood Debateable,\nwhich belike thou wottest of.\"\n\n\"All we of Upmeads wot of it,\" said Ralph.  \"Well,\" said the Captain,\n\"amongst these said Burgers, who were dwelling in the wildwood in\nsummer content, the word went free that they would gather to them other\nbands of strong-thieves who haunt that wood, and go with them upon\nUpmeads, and from Upmeads, when they were waxen strong, they would fall\nupon Higham by the Way, and thence with yet more strength on their old\ndwelling of the Burg.  Now whereas I know that thou art of Upmeads, and\nalso what thou art, and what thou hast done, I have ridden after thee\nto tell thee what is toward.  But if thou deemest I have brought thee\nall these riders it is not wholly so.  For it was borne into my mind\nthat our old stronghold was left bare of men, and I knew not what might\nbetide; and that the more, as more than one man has told us how that\nanother band of the disinherited Burgers have fallen upon Higham or the\nlands thereof, and Higham is no great way hence; so that some five\nscore of these riders are to hold our Castle of the Scaur, and the rest\nare for thee to ride afield with.  As for the others, thou hast been\ntold already that the Scaur, and Hampton therewith is a gift from us to\nthee; for henceforward we be the lords of the Burg of the Four Friths,\nand that is more than enough for us.\"\n\nRalph thanked the Captain for this, and did him to wit that he would\ntake the gift if he came back out the Upmeads fray alive:  said he,\n\"With thee and the Wheat-wearers in the Burg, and me in the Scaur, no\nstrong-thief shall dare lift up his hand in these parts.\"\n\nThe Captain smiled, and Ralph went on:  \"And now I must needs ask thee\nfor leave to depart; which is all the more needful, whereas thy men\nhave over-ridden their horses, and we must needs go a soft pace till we\ncome to Higham.\"\n\n\"Yea, art thou for Higham, fair sir?\" said the Captain.  \"That is well;\nfor ye may get men therefrom, and at the least it is like that ye shall\nhear tidings:  as to my men and their horses, this hath been looked to.\nFor five hundred good men of the Wheat-wearers, men who have not\nlearned the feat of arms a-horseback, are coming through the woods\nhither to help ward thy castle, fair lord; they will be here in some\nthree hours' space and will bring horses for thy five score men,\ntherefore do ye but ride softly to Higham and if these sergeants catch\nup with you it is well, but if not, abide them at Higham.\"\n\n\"Thanks have thou for this once more,\" said Ralph; \"and now I have no\nmore word than this for thee; that I will come to thee at thy least\nword, and serve thee with all that I have, to my very life if need be.\nAnd yet I must say this, that I wot not why ye and these others are\nbecome to me, who am alien to you, as very brothers.\"  Said the\nCaptain: \"There is this to be said of it, as was aforesaid, that all we\ncount thy winning of the Well at the World's End as valiancy in thee,\nyea, and luck withal.  But, moreover, she who was Our Lady would have\nhad thee for her friend had she lived, and how then could we be less\nthan friends to thee?  Depart in peace, my friend, and we look to see\nthee again in a little while.\"\n\nTherewith he kissed him, and bade farewell; and Ralph bade his band to\nhorse, and they were in the saddle in a twinkling, and rode away from\nHampton at a soft pace.\n\nBut as they went, Ralph turned to Ursula and said: \"And now belike\nshall we see Bourton Abbas once more, and the house where first I saw\nthee.  And O how sweet thou wert!  And I was so happy and so young.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said, \"and sorely I longed for thee, and now we have long\nbeen together, as it seemeth; and yet that long space shall be but a\nlittle while of our lives.  But, my friend, as to Bourton Abbas, I\nmisdoubt me of our seeing it; for there is a nigher road by the by-ways\nto Higham, which these men know, and doubtless that way we shall wend:\nand I am glad thereof; for I shall tell thee, that somewhat I fear that\nthorp, lest it should lay hold of me, and wake me from a dream.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"but even then, belike thou shouldst find me beside\nthee; as if I had fallen asleep in the ale-house, and dreamed of the\nWell at the World's End, and then awoke and seen the dear barefoot\nmaiden busying her about her house and its matters.  That were naught\nso ill.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"look round on thy men, and think of the might of war\nthat is in them, and think of the deeds to come.  But O how I would\nthat these next few days were worn away, and we yet alive for a long\nwhile.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nThey Come to the Gate of Higham By the Way\n\n\nIt was as Ursula had deemed, and they made for Higham by the shortest\nroad, so that they came before the gate a little before sunset: to the\nvery gate they came not; for there were strong barriers before it, and\nmen-at-arms within them, as though they were looking for an onfall.\nAnd amongst these were bowmen who bended their bows on Ralph and his\ncompany.  So Ralph stayed his men, and rode up to the barriers with\nRichard and Stephen a-Hurst, all three of them bare-headed with their\nswords in the sheaths; and Stephen moreover bearing a white cloth on a\ntruncheon.  Then a knight of the town, very bravely armed, came forth\nfrom the barriers and went up to Ralph, and said:  \"Fair sir, art thou\na knight?\"  \"Yea,\" said Ralph.  Said the knight, \"Who be ye?\"  \"I hight\nRalph of Upmeads,\" said Ralph, \"and these be my men:  and we pray thee\nfor guesting in the town of my Lord Abbot to-night, and leave to depart\nto-morrow betimes.\"\n\n\"O unhappy young man,\" said the knight, \"meseems these men be not so\nmuch thine as thou art theirs; for they are of the Dry Tree, and bear\ntheir token openly.  Wilt thou then lodge thy company of strong-thieves\nwith honest men?\"\n\nStephen a-Hurst laughed roughly at this word, but Ralph said mildly:\n\"These men are indeed of the Dry Tree, but they are my men and under my\nrule, and they be riding on my errands, which be lawful.\"\n\nThe knight was silent a while and then he said:  \"Well, it may be so;\nbut into this town they come not, for the tale of them is over long for\nhonest men to hearken to.\"\n\nEven as he spake, a man-at-arms somewhat evilly armed shoved through\nthe barriers, thrusting aback certain of his fellows, and, coming up to\nRalph, stood staring up into his face with the tears starting into his\neyes.  Ralph looked a moment, and then reached down his arms to embrace\nhim, and kissed his face; for lo! it was his own brother Hugh.  Withal\nhe whispered in his ear:  \"Get thee behind us, Hugh, if thou wilt come\nwith us, lad.\"  So Hugh passed on quietly toward the band, while Ralph\nturned to the knight again, who said to him, \"Who is that man?\" \"He is\nmine own brother,\" said Ralph.  \"Be he the brother of whom he will,\"\nsaid the knight, \"he was none the less our sworn man.  Ye fools,\" said\nhe, turning toward the men in the barrier, \"why did ye not slay him?\"\n\"He slipped out,\" said they, \"before we wotted what he was about.\" Said\nthe knight, \"Where were your bows, then?\"\n\nSaid a man:  \"They were pressing so hard on the barrier, that we could\nnot draw a bowstring.  Besides, how might we shoot him without hitting\nthee, belike?\"\n\nThe knight turned toward Ralph, grown wroth and surly, and that the\nmore he saw Stephen and Richard grinning; he said: \"Fair sir, ye have\nstrengthened the old saw that saith, Tell me what thy friends are, and\nI will tell thee what thou art.  Thou hast stolen our man with not a\nword on it.\"\n\n\"Fair sir,\" said Ralph, \"meseemeth thou makest more words than enough\nabout it.  Shall I buy my brother of thee, then?  I have a good few\npieces in my pouch.\"  The captain shook his head angrily.\n\n\"Well,\" said Ralph, \"how can I please thee, fair sir?\"\n\nQuoth the knight:  \"Thou canst please me best by turning thy horses'\nheads away from Higham, all the sort of you.\"  He stepped back toward\nthe barriers, and then came forward again, and said: \"Look you,\nman-at-arms, I warn thee that I trust thee not, and deem that thou\nliest.  Now have I mind to issue out and fall upon you: for ye shall be\nevil guests in my Lord Abbot's lands.\"\n\nNow at last Ralph waxed somewhat wroth, and he said: \"Come out then, if\nyou will, and we shall meet you man for man; there is yet light on this\nlily lea, and we will do so much for thee, churl though thou be.\"\n\nBut as he spoke, came the sounds of horns, and lo, over the bent showed\nthe points of spears, and then all those five-score of the Dry Tree\nwhom the captain had sent after Ralph came pouring down the bent.  The\nknight looked on them under the sharp of his hand, till he saw the Dry\nTree on their coats also, and then he turned and gat him hastily into\nthe barriers; and when he was amongst his own men he fell to roaring\nout a defiance to Ralph, and a bolt flew forth, and two or three\nshafts, but hurt no one.  Richard and Stephen drew their swords, but\nRalph cried out: \"Come away, friends, tarry not to bicker with these\nfools, who are afraid of they know not what:  it is but lying under the\nnaked heaven to-night instead of under the rafters, but we have all\nlodged thus a many times: and we shall be nigher to our journey's end\nto-morrow when we wake up.\"\n\nTherewith he turned his horse with Richard and Stephen and came to his\nown men.  There was much laughter and jeering at the Abbot's men amidst\nof the Dry Tree, both of those who had ridden with Ralph, and the\nnew-comers; but they arrayed them to ride further in good order, and\npresently were skirting the walls of Higham out of bow-shot, and making\nfor the Down country by the clear of the moon.  The sergeants had\ngotten a horse for Hugh, and by Ralph's bidding he rode beside him as\nthey went their ways, and the two brethren talked together lovingly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nTalk Between Those Two Brethren\n\n\nRalph asked Hugh first if he wotted aught of Gregory their brother.\nHugh laughed and pointed to Higham, and said:  \"He is yonder.\" \"What,\"\nsaid Ralph, \"in the Abbot's host?\"  \"Yea,\" said Hugh, laughing again,\n\"but in his spiritual, not his worldly host: he is turned monk,\nbrother; that is, he is already a novice, and will be a brother of the\nAbbey in six months' space.\"  Said Ralph: \"And Launcelot Long-tongue,\nthy squire, how hath he sped?\"  Said Hugh: \"He is yonder also, but in\nthe worldly host, not the spiritual: he is a sergeant of theirs, and\nsomewhat of a catch for them, for he is no ill man-at-arms, as thou\nwottest, and besides he adorneth everything with words, so that men\nhearken to him gladly.\" \"But tell me,\" said Ralph, \"how it befalleth\nthat the Abbot's men of war be so churlish, and chary of the inside of\ntheir town; what have they to fear?  Is not the Lord Abbot still a\nmighty man?\" Hugh shook his head:  \"There hath been a change of days at\nHigham; though I say not but that the knights are over careful, and\nmuch over fearful.\"  \"What has the change been?\" said Ralph.  Hugh\nsaid:  \"In time past my Lord Abbot was indeed a mighty man, and both\nthis town of Higham was well garnished of men-at-arms, and also many of\nhis manors had castles and strong-houses on them, and the yeomen were\nready to run to their weapons whenso the gathering was blown.  In\nshort, Higham was as mighty as it was wealthy; and the Abbot's men had\nnaught to do with any, save with thy friends here who bear the Tree\nLeafless; all else feared those holy walls and the well-blessed men who\nwarded them.  But the Dry Tree feared, as men said, neither man nor\ndevil (and I hope it may be so still since they are become thy\nfriends), and they would whiles lift in the Abbot's lands when they had\nno merrier business on hand, and not seldom came to their above in\ntheir dealings with his men.  But all things come to an end; for, as I\nam told, some year and a half ago, the Abbot had debate with the\nWestland Barons, who both were and are ill men to deal with, being both\nhungry and doughty.  The quarrel grew till my Lord must needs defy\nthem, and to make a long tale short, he himself in worldly armour led\nhis host against them, and they met some twenty miles to the west in\nthe field of the Wry Bridge, and there was Holy Church overthrown; and\nthe Abbot, who is as valiant a man as ever sang mass, though not\nover-wise in war, would not flee, and as none would slay him, might\nthey help it, they had to lead him away, and he sits to this day in\ntheir strongest castle, the Red Mount west-away. Well, he being gone,\nand many of his wisest warriors slain, the rest ran into gates again;\nbut when the Westlanders beset Higham and thought to have it good\ncheap, the monks and their men warded it not so ill but that the\nWestlanders broke their teeth over it.  Forsooth, they turned away\nthence and took most of the castles and strong-houses of the Abbot's\nlands; burned some and put garrisons into others, and drave away a\nmighty spoil of chattels and men and women, so that the lands of Higham\nare half ruined; and thereby the monks, though they be stout enough\nwithin their walls, will not suffer their men to ride abroad.  Whereby,\nbeing cooped up in a narrow place, and with no deeds to hand to cheer\ntheir hearts withal, they are grown sour and churlish.\"\n\n\"But, brother,\" said Ralph, \"howsoever churlish they may be, and howso\ntimorous, I cannot see why they should shut their gates in our faces, a\nlittle band, when there is no foe anear them.\"\n\n\"Ralph,\" said Hugh, \"thou must think of this once more, that the Dry\nTree is no good let-pass to flourish in honest men's faces; specialiter\nif they be monks.  Amongst the brothers of Higham the tale goes that\nthose Champions have made covenant with the devil to come to their\nabove whensoever they be not more than one to five.  Nay, moreover, it\nis said that there be very devils amongst them; some in the likeness of\ncarles, and some (God help us) dressed up in women's flesh; and fair\nflesh also, meseemeth.  Also to-day they say in Higham that no\notherwise might they ever have overcome the stark and cruel carles of\nthe Burg of the Four Friths and chased them out of their town, as we\nknow they have done.  Hah! what sayest thou?\"\n\n\"I say, Hugh,\" quoth Ralph angrily, \"that thou art a fool to go about\nwith a budget of slanderous old wives' tales.\"  Hugh laughed.  \"Be not\nso wroth, little lord, or I shall be asking thee tales of marvels also.\nBut hearken.  I shall smooth out thy frowns with a smile when thou hast\nheard this: this folk are not only afeard of their old enemies, the\ndevil-led men, but also they fear those whom the devil-led men have\ndriven out of house and home, to wit, the Burgers.  Yet again they fear\nthe Burgers yet more, because they have beaten some of the very foes of\nHigham, to wit, the Westland Barons; for they have taken from them some\nof their strong-holds, and are deemed to be gathering force.\"\n\nRalph pondered a while, and then he said:  \"Brother, hast thou any\ntidings of Upmeads, or that these Burgers have gone down thither?\" \"God\nforbid!\" said Hugh.  \"Nay, I have had no tidings of Upmeads since I was\nfool enough to leave it.\"\n\n\"What! brother,\" said Ralph, \"thou hast not thriven then?\"\n\n\"I have had ups and downs,\" said Hugh, \"but the ups have been one rung\nof the ladder, and the downs three--or more.  Three months I sat in\nprison for getting me a broken head in a quarrel that concerned me not.\nSix months was I besieged in a town whither naught led me but ill-luck.\nTwo days I wore in running thence, having scaled the wall and swam the\nditch in the night.  Three months I served squire to a knight who gave\nme the business of watching his wife of whom he was jealous; and to\nhelp me out of the weariness of his house I must needs make love myself\nto the said wife, who sooth to say was perchance worth it.  Thence\nagain I went by night and cloud.  Ten months I wore away at the edge of\nthe wildwood, and sometimes in it, with a sort of fellows who taught me\nmany things, but not how to keep my hands from other men's goods when I\nwas hungry.  There was I taken with some five others by certain\nsergeants of Higham, whom the warriors of the town had sent out\ncautiously to see if they might catch a few men for their ranks.  Well,\nthey gave me the choice of the gallows-tree or service for the Church,\nand so, my choice made, there have I been ever since, till I saw thy\nface this evening, fair sir.\"\n\n\"Well, brother,\" said Ralph, \"all that shall be amended, and thou shalt\nback to Upmeads with me.  Yet wert thou to amend thyself somewhat, it\nmight not be ill.\"\n\nQuoth Hugh:  \"It shall be tried, brother.  But may I ask thee\nsomewhat?\" Said Ralph:  \"Ask on.\"  \"Fair Sir,\" said Hugh, \"thou\nseemedst grown into a pretty man when I saw thee e'en-now before this\ntwilight made us all alike; but the men at thy back are not wont to be\nled by men who have not earned a warrior's name, yet they follow thee:\nhow cometh that about?  Again, before the twilight gathered I saw the\nwoman that rideth anigh us (who is now but a shadow) how fair and\ngentle she is: indeed there is no marvel in her following thee (though\nif she be an earl's daughter she is a fair getting for an imp of\nUpmeads), for thou art a well shapen lad, little lord, and carriest a\nsweet tongue in thy mouth.  But tell me, what is she?\"\n\n\"Brother,\" said Ralph kindly, \"she is my wife.\"\n\n\"I kiss her hands,\" said Hugh; \"but of what lineage is she?\"\n\n\"She is my wife,\" said Ralph.  Said Hugh:  \"That is, forsooth, a high\ndignity.\"  Said Ralph:  \"Thou sayest sooth, though in mockery thou\nspeakest, which is scarce kind to thine own mother's son: but learn,\nbrother, that I am become a Friend of the Well, and were meet to wed\nwith the daughters of the best of the Kings: yet is this one meeter to\nwed with me than the highest of the Queens; for she also is a Friend of\nthe Well.  Moreover, thou sayest it that the champions of the Dry Tree,\nwho would think but little of an earl for a leader, are eager to follow\nme: and if thou still doubt what this may mean, abide, till in two days\nor three thou see me before the foeman.  Then shalt thou tell me how\nmuch changed I am from the stripling whom thou knewest in Upmeads a\nlittle while ago.\"\n\nThen was Hugh somewhat abashed, and he said:  \"I crave thy pardon,\nbrother, but never had I a well filed tongue, and belike it hath grown\nno smoother amid the hard haps which have befallen me of late.  Besides\nit was dull in there, and I must needs try to win a little mirth out of\nkith and kin.\"\n\n\"So be it, lad,\" quoth Ralph kindly, \"thou didst ask and I told, and\nall is said.\"\n\n\"Yet forsooth,\" said Hugh, \"thou hast given me marvel for marvel,\nbrother.\" \"Even so,\" said Ralph, \"and hereafter I will tell thee more\nwhen we sit safe by the wine at Upmeads.\"\n\nNow cometh back one of the fore-riders and draweth rein by Ralph and\nsaith that they are hard on a little thorp under the hanging of the\nhill that was the beginning of the Down country on that road.  So Ralph\nbade make stay there and rest the night over, and seek new tidings on\nthe morrow; and the man told Ralph that the folk of the thorp were\nfleeing fast at the tidings of their company, and that it were best\nthat he and some half score should ride sharply into the thorp, so that\nit might not be quite bare of victuals when they came to their night's\nlodging.  Ralph bids him so do, but to heed well that he hurt no man,\nor let fire get into any house or roof; so he takes his knot of men and\nrides off on the spur, and Ralph and the main of them come on quietly;\nand when they came into the street of the thorp, lo there by the cross\na big fire lighted, and the elders standing thereby cap in hand, and a\nscore of stout carles with weapons in their hands.  Then the chief man\ncame up to Ralph and greeted him and said: \"Lord, when we heard that an\narmed company was at hand we deemed no less than that the riders of the\nBurg were upon us, and deemed that there was nought for it but to flee\neach as far and as fast as he might.  But now we have heard that thou\nart a good lord seeking his own with the help of worthy champions, and\na foeman to those devils of the Burg, we bid thee look upon us and all\nwe have as thine, lord, and take kindly such guesting as we may give\nthee.\"\n\nThe old man's voice quavered a little as he looked on the stark shapes\nof the Dry Tree; but Ralph looked kindly on him, and said: \"Yea, my\nmaster, we will but ask for a covering for our heads, and what victual\nthou mayst easily spare us in return for good silver, and thou shalt\nhave our thanks withal.  But who be these stout lads with staves and\nbucklers, or whither will they to-night?\"\n\nThereat a tall young man with a spear in his hand and girt with a short\nsword came forth and said boldly:  \"Lord, we be a few who thought when\nwe heard that the Burg-devils were at hand that we might as well die in\nthe field giving stroke for stroke, as be hauled off and drop to pieces\nunder the hands of their tormentors; and now thou hast come, we have\nlittle will to abide behind, but were fain to follow thee, and do thee\nwhat good we can: and after thou hast come to thine above, when we go\nback to our kin thou mayst give us a gift if it please thee: but we\ndeem that no great matter if thou but give us leave to have the comfort\nof thee and thy Champions for a while in these hard days.\"\n\nWhen he had done speaking there rose up from the Champions a hum as of\npraise, and Ralph was well-pleased withal, deeming it a good omen; so\nhe said:  \"Fear not, good fellows, that I shall forget you when we have\novercome the foemen, and meanwhile we will live and die together.  But\nthou, ancient man, show our sergeants where our riders shall lie\nto-night, and what they shall do with their horses.\"\n\nSo the elders marshalled the little host to their abodes for that\nnight, lodging the more part of them in a big barn on the western\noutskirt of the thorp.  The elder who led them thither, brought them\nvictual and good drink, and said to them: \"Lords, ye were best to keep\na good watch to-night because it is on this side that we may look for\nan onfall from the foemen if they be abroad to-night; and sooth to say\nthat is one cause we have bestowed you here, deeming that ye would not\ngrudge us the solace of knowing that your valiant bodies were betwixt\nus and them, for we be a poor unwalled people.\"\n\nStephen to whom he spake laughed at his word, and said: \"Heart-up,\ncarle! within these few days we shall build up a better wall than ye\nmay have of stone and lime; and that is the overthrow of our foemen in\nthe open field.\"\n\nSo there was kindness and good fellowship betwixt the thorp-dwellers\nand the riders, and the country folk told those others many tales of\nthe evil deeds of the Burg-devils, as they called them; but they could\nnot tell them for certain whether they had gone down into Upmeads.\n\nAs to Ralph and Ursula they, with Richard and Roger, were lodged in the\nheadman's house, and had good feast there, and he also talked over the\nwhere-abouts of the Burgers with the thorp-dwellers, but might have no\ncertain tidings.  So he and Ursula and his fellows went to bed and\nslept peacefully for the first hours of the night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nAn Old Acquaintance Comes From the Down Country to See Ralph\n\n\nBut an hour after midnight Ralph arose, as his purpose was, and called\nRichard, and they took their swords and went forth and about the thorp\nand around its outskirts, and found naught worse than their own watch\nany where; so they came back again to their quarters and found Roger\nstanding at the door, who said to Ralph:  \"Lord, here is a man who\nwould see thee.\" \"What like is he?\" said Ralph.  Said Roger \"He is an\nold man, but a tough one; however, I have got his weapons from him.\"\n\"Bring him in,\" said Ralph, \"and he shall have his say.\"\n\nSo they all went into the chamber together and there was light therein;\nbut the man said to Ralph:  \"Art thou the Captain of the men-at-arms,\nlord?\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph.  Said the man, \"I were as lief have these\nothers away.\" \"So be it,\" said Ralph; \"depart for a little while,\nfriends.\" So they went but Ursula lay in the bed, which was in a nook\nin the wall; the man looked about the chamber and said:  \"Is there any\none in the bed?\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"my wife, good fellow; shall she go\nalso?\" \"Nay,\" said the carle, \"we shall do as we are now.  So I will\nbegin my tale.\"\n\nRalph looked on him and deemed he had seen him before, but could not\naltogether call his visage to mind; so he held his peace and the man\nwent on.\n\n\"I am of the folk of the shepherds of the Downs:  we be not a many by\ncount of noses, but each one of us who is come to man's yean, and many\nwho be past them, as I myself, can handle weapons at a pinch.  Now some\ndeal we have been harried and have suffered by these wretches who have\neaten into the bowels of this land; that is to say, they have lifted\nour sheep, and slain some of us who withstood them: but whereas our\nhouses be uncostly and that we move about easily from one hill-side to\nanother, it is like that we should have deemed it wisest to have borne\nthis trouble, like others of wind and weather, without seeking new\nremedy, but that there have been tokens on earth and in the heavens,\nwhereof it is too long to tell thee, lord, at present, which have\nstirred up our scattered folk to meet together in arms.  Moreover, the\nblood of our young men is up, because the Burg-devils have taken some\nof our women, and have mishandled them grievously and shamefully, so\nthat naught will keep point and edge from seeking the war-clash.\nFurthermore, there is an old tale which hath now come up again, That\nsome time when our folk shall be in great need, there shall come to our\nhelping one from afar, whose home is anigh; a stripling and a great\nman; a runaway, and the conqueror of many: then, say they, shall the\npoint and the edge bring the red water down on the dear dales; whereby\nwe understand that the blood of men shall be shed there, and naught to\nour shame or dishonour.  Again I mind me of a rhyme concerning this\nwhich sayeth:\n\n    The Dry Tree shall be seen\n    On the green earth, and green\n    The Well-spring shall arise\n    For the hope of the wise.\n    They are one which were twain,\n    The Tree bloometh again,\n    And the Well-spring hath come\n    From the waste to the home.\n\nWell, lord, thou shalt tell me presently if this hath aught to do with\nthee: for indeed I saw the Dry Tree, which hath scared us so many a\ntime, beaten on thy sergeants' coats; but now I will go on and make an\nend of my story.\"\n\nRalph nodded to him kindly, for now he remembered the carle, though he\nhad seen him but that once when he rode the Greenway across the downs\nto Higham.  The old man looked up at him as if he too had an inkling of\nold acquaintance with Ralph, but went on presently:\n\n\"There is a woman who dwells alone with none to help her, anigh to\nSaint Ann's Chapel; a woman not very old; for she is of mine own age,\nand time was we have had many a fair play in the ingles of the downs in\nthe July weather--not very old, I say, but wondrous wise, as I know\nbetter than most men; for oft, even when she was young, would she\nforetell things to come to me, and ever it fell out according to her\nspaedom.  To the said woman I sought to-day in the morning, not to win\nany wisdom of her, but to talk over remembrances of old days; but when\nI came into her house, lo, there was my carline walking up and down the\nfloor, and she turned round upon me like the young woman of past days,\nand stamped her foot and cried out: 'What does the sluggard dallying\nabout women's chambers when the time is come for the deliverance?'\n\n\"I let her talk, and spake no word lest I should spoil her story, and\nshe went on:\n\n\"'Take thy staff, lad, for thou art stout as well as merry, and go\nadown to the thorps at the feet of the downs toward Higham; keep thee\nwell from the Burg-devils, and go from stead to stead till thou comest\non a captain of men-at-arms who is lord over a company of green-coats,\ngreen-coats of the Dry Tree--a young lord, fair-faced, and kind-faced,\nand mighty, and not to be conquered, and the blessing of the folk and\nthe leader of the Shepherds, and the foe of their foeman and the\nwell-beloved of Bear-father.  Go night and day, sit not down to eat,\nstand not to drink; heed none that crieth after thee for deliverance,\nbut go, go, go till thou hast found him.  Meseems I see him riding\ntoward Higham, but those dastards will not open gate to him, of that be\nsure.  He shall pass on and lie to-night, it may be at Mileham, it may\nbe at Milton, it may be at Garton; at one of those thorps shall ye find\nhim.  And when ye have found him thus bespeak him:  O bright Friend of\nthe Well, turn not aside to fall on the Burgers in this land, either at\nFoxworth Castle, or the Longford, or the Nineways Garth: all that thou\nmayest do hereafter, thou or thy champions.  There be Burgers\notherwhere, housed in no strong castle, but wending the road toward the\nfair greensward of Upmeads.  If thou delay to go look on them, then\nshall thy work be to begin again amid sorrow of heart and loss that may\nnot be remedied.' Hast thou heard me, lord?\"\n\n\"Yea, verily,\" said Ralph, \"and at sunrise shall we be in the saddle to\nride straight to Upmeads.  For I know thee, friend.\"\n\n\"Hold a while,\" said the carle, \"for meseemeth I know thee also.  But\nthis withal she said:  'But hearken, Giles, hearken a while, for I see\nhim clearly, and the men that he rideth with, and the men that are\nfollowing to his aid, fierce and fell are they; but so withal are the\nfoemen that await them, and his are few, howsoever fierce.  Therefore\nbid him this also.  Haste, haste, haste!  But haste not overmuch, lest\nthou speed the worse:  in Bear Castle I see a mote of our folk, and\nthee amidst of it with thy champions, and I see the staves of the\nShepherds rising round thee like a wood.  In Wulstead I see a valiant\nman with sword by side and sallet on head, and with him sitteth a tall\nman-at-arms grizzle-headed and red-bearded, big-boned and mighty; they\nsit at the wine in a fair chamber, and a well-looking dame serveth\nthem; and there are weaponed men no few about the streets.  Wilt thou\npass by friends, and old friends?  Now ride on, Green Coats!  stride\nforth, Shepherds! staves on your shoulders, Wool-wards! and there goes\nthe host over the hills into Upmeads, and the Burg-devils will have\ncome from the Wood Debateable to find graves by the fair river.  And\nthen do thy will, O Friend of the Well.'\"\n\nThe carle took a breath, and then he said:  \"Lord, this is the say I\nwas charged with, and if thou understandest it, well; but if it be dark\nto thee, I may make it clear if thou ask me aught.\"\n\nRalph pondered a while, and then he said:  \"Is it known of others than\nthy spaewife that the Burgers be in Upmeads?\" \"Nay, lord,\" said the\ncarle, \"and this also I say to thee, that I deem what she said that\nthey be not in Upmeads yet, and but drawing thitherward, as I deem from\nthe Wood Debateable.\"\n\nRalph arose from his seat and strode up and down the chamber a while;\nthen he went to bed, and stood over Ursula, who lay twixt sleeping and\nwaking, for she was weary; then he came back to the carle, and said to\nhim:  \"Good friend, I thank thee, and this is what I shall do: when\ndaylight is broad (and lo, the dawn beginning!) I shall gather my men,\nand ride the shortest way, which thou shalt show me, to Bear Castle,\nand there I shall give the token of the four fires which erewhile a\ngood man of the Shepherds bade me if I were in need.  And it seems to\nme that there shall the mote be hallowed, though it may be not before\nnightfall.  But the mote done, we shall wend, the whole host of us, be\nwe few or many, down to Wulstead, where we shall fall in with my friend\nClement Chapman, and hear tidings.  Thence shall we wend the dear ways\nI know into the land where I was born and the folk amongst whom I shall\ndie.  And so let St. Nicholas and All Hallows do as they will with us.\nDeemest thou, friend, that this is the meaning of thy wise she-friend?\"\n\nThe carle's eyes glittered, and he rose up and stood close by Ralph,\nand said:  \"Even so she meant; and now I seem to see that but few of\nthy riders shall be lacking when they turn their heads away from\nUpmeads towards the strong-places of the Burg-devils that are\nhereabouts.  But tell me, Captain of the host, is that victual and\nbread that I see on the board?\"\n\nRalph laughed:  \"Fall to, friend, and eat thy fill; and here is wine\nwithal.  Thou needest not to fear it.  Wert thou any the worse of the\nwine that Thirly poured into thee that other day?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, master,\" said the carle between his mouthfuls, \"but mickle\nthe better, as I shall be after this:  all luck to thee!  Yet see I\nthat I need not wish thee luck, since that is thine already.  Sooth to\nsay, I deemed I knew thee when I first set eyes on thee again.  I\nlooked not to see thee more; though I spoke to thee words at that time\nwhich came from my heart, almost without my will.  Though it is but a\nlittle while ago, thou hast changed much since then, and hast got\nanother sort of look in the eyes than then they had.  Nay, nay,\" said\nhe laughing, \"not when thou lookest on me so frankly and kindly; that\nis like thy look when we passed Thirly about.  Yea, I see the fashion\nof it:  one look is for thy friends, another for thy foes.  God be\npraised for both.  And now I am full, I will go look on thy wife.\"\n\nSo he went up to the bed and stood over Ursula, while she, who was not\nfully awake, smiled up into his face.  The old man smiled back at her\nand bent down and kissed her mouth, and said: \"I ask thy pardon, lady,\nand thine, my lord, if I be too free, but such is our custom of the\nDowns; and sooth to say thy face is one that even a old man should not\nfail to kiss if occasion serve, so that he may go to paradise with the\ntaste thereof on his lips.\"\n\n\"We are nowise hurt by thy love, friend,\" said Ursula; \"God make thy\nlatter days of life sweet to thee!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nThey Ride to Bear Castle\n\n\nBut while they spake thus and were merry, the dawn had wellnigh passed\ninto daylight.  Then Ralph bade old Giles sleep for an hour, and went\nforth and called Roger and Richard and went to the great barn.  There\nhe bade the watch wake up Stephen and all men, and they gat to horse as\nspeedily as they might, and were on the road ere the sun was fully up.\nThe spearmen of the thorp did not fail them, and numbered twenty and\nthree all told.  Giles had a horse given him and rode the way by Ralph.\n\nThey rode up and down the hills and dales, but went across country and\nnot by the Greenway, for thuswise the road was shorter.\n\nBut when they had gone some two leagues, and were nigh on top of a\ncertain low green ridge, they deemed that they heard men's voices anigh\nand the clash of arms; and it must be said that by Ralph's rede they\njourneyed somewhat silently.  So Ralph, who was riding first with\nGiles, bid all stay and let the crown of the ridge cover them.  So did\nthey, and Giles gat off his horse and crept on to the top of the ridge\ntill he could see down to the dale below.  Presently he came down again\nthe old face of him puckered with mirth, and said softly to Ralph: \"Did\nI not say thou wert lucky? here is the first fruits thereof.  Ride over\nthe ridge, lord, at once, and ye shall have what there is of them as\nsafe as a sheep in a penfold.\"\n\nSo Ralph drew sword and beckoned his men up, and they all handled their\nweapons and rode over the brow, and tarried not one moment there, not\neven to cry their cries; for down in the bottom were a sort of men, two\nscore and six (as they counted them afterward) sitting or lying about a\ncooking fire, or loitering here and there, with their horses standing\nbehind them, and they mostly unhelmed.  The Champions knew them at once\nfor men of their old foes, and there was scarce time for a word ere the\nfull half of them had passed by the sword of the Dry Tree; then Ralph\ncried out to spare the rest, unless they offered to run; so the foemen\ncast down their weapons and stood still, and were presently brought\nbefore Ralph, who sat on the grass amidst of the ring of the Champions.\nHe looked on them a while and remembered the favour of those whom he\nhad seen erewhile in the Burg; but ere he could speak Giles said softly\nin his ear: \"These be of the Burg, forsooth, as ye may see by their\ndogs' faces; but they be not clad nor armed as those whom we have met\nheretofore.  Ask them whence they be, lord.\"\n\nRalph spake and said:  \"Whence and whither are ye, ye manslayers?\" But\nno man of them answered.  Then said Ralph:  \"Pass these murderers by\nthe edge of the sword, Stephen; unless some one of them will save his\nlife and the life of his fellows by speaking.\"\n\nAs he spake, one of the youngest of the men hung down his head a\nlittle, and then raised it up:  \"Wilt thou spare our lives if I speak?\"\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph.  \"Wilt thou swear it by the edge of the blade?\" said\nthe man.  Ralph drew forth his sword and said:  \"Lo then!  I swear it.\"\nThe man nodded his head, and said:  \"Few words are best; and whereas I\nwot not if my words will avail thee aught, and since they will save our\nlives, I will tell thee truly.  We are men of the Burg whom these\ngreen-coated thieves drave out of the Burg on an unlucky day.  Well,\nsome of us, of whom I was one, fetched a compass and crossed the water\nthat runneth through Upmeads by the Red Bridge, and so gat us into the\nWood Debateable through the Uplands.  There we struck a bargain with\nthe main band of strong-thieves of the wood, that we and they together\nwould get us a new home in Upmeads, which is a fat and pleasant land.\nSo we got us ready; but the Woodmen told us that the Upmeads carles,\nthough they be not many, are strong and dauntless, and since we now had\npleasant life before us, with good thralls to work for us, and with\nplenty of fair women for our bed-mates, we deemed it best to have the\nmost numbers we might, so that we might over-whelm the said carles at\none blow, and get as few of ourselves slain as might be.  Now we knew\nthat another band of us had entered the lands of the Abbot of Higham,\nand had taken hold of some of his castles; wherefore the captains\nconsidered and thought, and sent us to give bidding to our folk south\nhere to march at once toward us in Upmeads, that our bands might meet\nthere, and scatter all before us.  There is our story, lord.\"\n\nRalph knitted his brow, and said:  \"Tell me (and thy life lieth on thy\ngiving true answers), do thy folk in these strongholds know of your\npurpose of falling upon Upmeads?\" \"Nay,\" said the Burger.  Said Ralph:\n\"And will they know otherwise if ye do them not to wit?\"  \"Nay,\" again\nsaid the man.  Said Ralph:  \"Are thy folk already in Upmeads?\"  \"Nay,\"\nsaid the captive, \"but by this time they will be on the road thither.\"\n\"How many all told?\" said Ralph The man reddened and stammered: \"A\nthousand--two--two thousand--A thousand, lord,\" said he.  \"Get thy\nsword ready, Stephen,\" said Ralph.  \"How many, on thy life, Burger?\"\n\"Two thousand, lord,\" said the man.  \"And how many do ye look to have\nfrom Higham-land?\" Said the Burger, \"Somewhat more than a thousand.\"\nWithal he looked uneasily at his fellows, some of whom were scowling on\nhim felly.  \"Tell me now,\" said Ralph, \"where be the other bands of the\nBurgers?\"\n\nEre the captive could speak, he who stood next him snatched an\nunsheathed knife from the girdle of one of the Dry Tree, and quick as\nlightning thrust it into his fellow's belly, so that he fell dead at\nonce amongst them.  Then Stephen, who had his sword naked in his hand,\nstraightway hewed down the slayer, and swords came out of the scabbards\neverywhere; and it went but a little but that all the Burgers were\nslain at once.  But Ralph cried out:  \"Put up your swords, Champions!\nStephen slew yonder man for slaying his fellow, who was under my ward,\nand that was but his due.  But I have given life to these others, and\nso it must be held to.  Tie their hands behind them and let us on to\nBear Castle.  For this tide brooks no delay.\"\n\nSo they gat to horse, and the footmen from Garton mounted the horses of\nthe slain Burgers, and had the charge of guarding the twenty that were\nleft.  So they rode off all of them toward Bear Castle, and shortly to\nsay it, came within sight of its rampart two hours before noon.  Sooner\nhad they came thither; but divers times they caught up with small\ncompanies of weaponed men, whose heads were turned the same way; and\nGiles told Ralph each time that they were of the Shepherd-folk going to\nthe mote.  But now when they were come so nigh to the castle they saw a\nvery stream of men setting that way, and winding up the hill to the\nrampart.  And Giles said:  \"It is not to be doubted but that Martha\nhath sent round the war-brand, and thou wilt presently have an host\nthat will meet thy foemen without delay; and what there lacks in number\nshall be made good by thy luck, which once again was shown by our\nfalling in with that company e'en now.\"\n\n\"Yea truly,\" said Ralph, \"but wilt thou now tell me how I shall guide\nmyself amongst thy folk, and if they will grant me the aid I ask?\"\n\n\"Look, look,\" said Giles, \"already some one hath made clear thine\nasking to our folk; and hearken! up there they are naming the ancient\nFather of our Race, without whom we may do nought, even with the\nblessed saints to aid.  There then is thine answer, lord.\"\n\nIndeed as he spoke came down on the wind the voice of a chant, sung by\nmany folk, the words whereof he well remembered: SMITE ASIDE AXE, O\nBEAR-FATHER. And therewith rose up into the air a column of smoke\nintermingled with fire from each of the four corners of that stronghold\nof the Ancient Folk.  Ralph rejoiced when he saw it, and the heart rose\nwithin him and fluttered in his bosom, and Ursula, who rode close\nbehind him, looked up into his face well pleased and happy.\n\nThus rode they up the bent and over the turf bridge into the plain of\nthe garth, and whatso of people were there flocked about to behold the\nnew-come warriors; sooth to say, there were but some two hundreds, who\nlooked but few indeed in the great square place, but more were\nstreaming in every minute.  Giles led him and his men into the\nnorth-east corner of the castle, and there they gat off their horses\nand lay down on the grass awaiting what should betide.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\nThe Folkmote of the Shepherds\n\n\nIn about an hour all the folk within the castle began to set toward the\ningle wherein lay Ralph and his fellows, and then all rose up, while\nthe folk of the Shepherds took their places on the slopes of the earth\nwalls, but on the top hard by the fire, which was still burning, stood\nup an old hoar man with a beard exceeding long; he had a sallet on his\nhead, and held a guisarme in his hand.  All men held their peace when\nthey saw him standing there; and straightway he proclaimed the\nhallowing of the Mote in such form of words as was due amongst that\nfolk, and which were somewhat long to tell here.  Then was silence\nagain for a little, and then the old man spake: \"Few words are best\nto-day, neighbours; for wherefore are we met together?\" There arose a\nhum of assent from the Shepherds as he spoke and men clashed their\nweapons together; but none said any clear word.  Then spake the old\nman:  \"We be met together because we have trouble on hand, and because\nthere is a helper to hand, of whom the words of the wise and tales of\nold have told us; and because as he shall help us, so shall we help\nhim, since indeed our trouble is his also: now, neighbours, shall I say\nthe word for you which ye would say to this young man, who is\nnevertheless old in wisdom, and true-hearted and kind?\"\n\nThen came the hum of yeasay again, the clashing of weapons, and the old\nman spake again:  \"Ralph of Upmeads, there thou standest, wilt thou\nhelp us against the tyrants, as we shall help thee?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Ralph.  Said the Elder:  \"Wilt thou be our Captain, if we\ndo according to thy bidding?  For thou needest not fear our failing\nthee.\"\n\n\"Yea verily,\" said Ralph.\n\nSaid the Elder:  \"Ralph of Upmeads, wilt thou be our Captain as an\nalien and a hireling, or as a brother?\"\n\n\"As a brother,\" quoth Ralph.\n\n\"Come up here then, Captain of our folk, and take my hand in thine, and\nswear by our fathers and thine to be a true brother of us, and take\nthis ancient staff of war in thine hand.  And, ye kindred of the\nShepherds, bear witness of his swearing.  Yea and ye also, O neighbours\nof the Dry Tree!\"\n\nSo Ralph went up on the wall-top and took the Elder's hand, and took\nfrom him the ancient guisarme, which was inlaid with gold letters of\nold time; and he swore in a loud voice to be a true brother of the\nShepherd-folk, and raised the weapon aloft and shook it strongly, and\nall the Folk cried, \"Hail our brother!\" and the Champions shouted\ngladly withal, and great joy there was in that ingle of the ancient\nwork.\n\nThen spake the Elder and said:  \"Ye champions of the Dry Tree, will ye\nwend with us under the Captain our brother against his foemen and ours?\"\n\nThen stood forth Stephen a-Hurst and said, \"Master shepherd, for nought\nelse are we come hither.\"\n\nSaid the Elder:  \"Will ye come with us as friends or as hirelings?  for\nin any case we would have you by our sides, and not in face of us; and\nthough we be shepherds, and unhoused, or ill-housed, yet have we\nwherewithal to wage you, as ye know well enough, who have whiles lifted\nour gear.\"\n\nThen Stephen laughed and said:  \"True it is that we have whiles driven\nprey in your country, yea, and had some hard knocks therein; but all\nthat was in playing the game of war, and now since we are to fight side\nby side, we will be paid by our foes and not by our friends; so neither\nhair nor wool will we have of yours, whatever we may have of the\nBurgers; and it is like that we shall be good friends of yours\nhence-forward.\"\n\nOnce more all they that were there shouted.  But once more the Elder\nspoke and said:  \"Is any man now wishful to speak?\" None answered till\na big and burly man rose up and said: \"Nay, Tall Thomas, thou hast said\nand done all that need was, and I deem that time presses; wherefore my\nmind is that we now break up this mote, and that after we have eaten a\nmorsel we get ourselves into due array and take to the road.  Now let\nany man speak against this if he will.\"\n\nNone gainsaid him; nay, all seemed well-pleased. So the Elder\nproclaimed the breaking up of the mote, and they went from out the\nhallowed place and sat down in the dyke on the outside of the rampart\nand behind the country which stretched out all lovely and blue before\nthem, for the day was bright and fair.  There then certain women\nbrought victual and drink to them, and served the strangers first.\n\nSo when they had eaten and drunk, Ralph bade the Shepherds array them\nduly, and appointed them leaders of tens and hundreds with the help of\nGiles, who was now clad in a hauberk and mail-coif and looked a proper\nman-at-arms.  Then they told over their company, and numbered of the\nDry Tree one hundred and fifty champions, outtaken Stephen and Roger;\nof the men of Garton were twenty and two, and of the Shepherds three\nhundred and seventy and seven stout carles, some eighty of whom had\nbows, and the rest glaives and spears and other staff-weapons. There\nwas not much armour of defence amongst them, but they were one and all\nstark carles and doughty.\n\nSo when they were told over and made five hundred and fifty and four,\nthey gat them into array for the road; and Ralph went afoot with no\narmour but his sallet, and a light coat of fence which he had gotten\nhim in the Burg.  He would have had Ursula ride on her palfrey with the\nSage, but she would not, and held it for mirth and pleasure that she\nshould go afoot through the land, now she was so nigh come home to her\nlord's house; so she went forth by Ralph's side with her broidered gown\ntrussed through her girdle so that the trimness of her feet drew the\neyes of all men to them.  As for Richard, he took a half score of the\nchampions, and they rode on ahead to see that all was clear before the\nmain host; which he might well do, as he knew the country so well.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\nThey Come to Wulstead\n\n\nThus went they, and nought befell them to tell of till they came anigh\nthe gates of Wulstead hard on sunset.  The gates, it has been said; for\nwhereas Ralph left Wulstead a town unwalled, he now found it fenced\nwith pales, and with two towers strongly framed of timber, one on\neither side the gate, and on the battlements of the said towers they\nsaw spears glittering; before the gate they saw a barrier of big beams\nalso, and the gleaming of armour therein.  Ralph was glad when he saw\nthat they meant some defence; for though Wulstead was not in the lands\nof Upmeads, yet it was always a friendly neighbour, and he looked to\neke out his host therein.\n\nWulstead standeth on a little hill or swelling of the earth, and the\nroad that the company of Ralph took went up to the gate across the\nplain meadows, which had but here and there a tree upon them, so that\nthe going of the company was beheld clearly from the gate; as was well\nseen, because anon came the sound of the blowing of great horns, and\nthe spears thickened in the towers.  Then Ralph stayed his company two\nbowshots from the barriers, while he himself, with his sword in his\nsheath, took Ursula's hand and set forth an easy pace toward the gate.\nSome of his company, and specially Roger and Stephen, would have letted\nhim; but he laughed and said, \"Why, lads, why? these be friends.\"\n\"Yea,\" quoth Roger, \"but an arrow knoweth no kindred nor well-willers:\nhave a care, lord.\"  Said the Sage of Swevenham: \"Ye speak but after\nthe folly of men of war; the hands and the eyes that be behind the bows\nhave other hands and eyes behind them which shall not suffer that a\nFriend of the Well shall be hurt.\"\n\nSo Ralph and Ursula went forth, and came within a stone's cast of the\nbarrier, when Ralph lifted up his voice and said: \"Is there a captain\nof the townsfolk within the timber there?\" A cheery voice answered him:\n\"Yea, yea, lad; spare thy breath; I am coming to thee.\"\n\nAnd therewith a man came from out the barrier and did off his headpiece\nand ran straight toward Ralph, who saw at once that it was Clement\nChapman; he made no more ado, but coming up to Ralph fell to clipping\nhim in his arms, while the tears ran down his face.  Then he stood\naloof and gazed upon him speechless a little while, and then spake:\n\"Hail, and a hundred times hail! but now I look on thee I see what hath\nbetid, and that thou art too noble and high that I should have cast\nmine arms about thee.  But now as for this one, I will be better\nmannered with her.\"\n\nTherewith he knelt down before Ursula, and kissed her feet, but\nreverently.  And she stooped down and raised him up, with a merry\ncountenance kissed his face, and stroked his cheeks with her hand and\nsaid: \"Hail, friend of my lord!  Was it not rather thou than he who\ndelivered me from the pain and shame of Utterbol, whereas thou didst\nbring him safe through the mountains unto Goldburg?  And but for that\nthere had been no Well, either for him or for me.\"\n\nBut Clement stood with his head hanging down, and his face reddening.\nTill Ralph said to him:  \"Hail, friend! many a time we thought of this\nmeeting when we were far away and hard bestead; but this is better than\nall we thought of.  But now, Clement, hold up thine head and be a stout\nman of war, for thou seest that we are not alone.\"\n\nSaid Clement:  \"Yea, fair lord, and timely ye come, both thou and thy\ncompany; and now that I have my speech again which joy hath taken away\nfrom me at the first, I shall tell thee this, that if ye go further\nthan the good town ye shall be met and fought withal by men who are\nover-many and over-fierce for us.\" \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and how many be\nthey?\"  Quoth Clement: \"How many men may be amongst them I wot not, but\nI deem there be some two thousand devils.\"\n\nNow Ralph reddened, and he took Clement by the shoulder, and said:\n\"Tell me, Clement, are they yet in Upmeads?\"  \"Sooth to say,\" said\nClement, \"by this while they may be therein; but this morn it was yet\nfree of them; but when thou art home in our house, thy gossip shall\nbelike tell thee much more than I can; for she is foreseeing, and hath\ntold us much in this matter also that hath come to pass.\" Then spake\nRalph:  \"Where are my father and my mother; and shall I go after them\nat once without resting, through the dark night and all?\"\n\nSaid Clement, and therewith his face brightened:  \"Nay, thou needest go\nno further to look for them than the House of Black Canons within our\nwalls: there are they dwelling in all honour and dignity these two days\npast.\" \"What!\" said Ralph, \"have they fled from Upmeads, and left the\nHigh House empty?  I pray thee, Clement, bring me to them as speedily\nas may be.\"\n\n\"Verily,\" said Clement, \"they have fled, with many another, women and\nchildren and old men, who should but hinder the carles who have abided\nbehind.  Nicholas Longshanks is the leader of them down there, and the\nHigh House is their stronghold in a way; though forsooth their stout\nheads and strong hands are better defence.\"\n\nHere Ralph brake in:  \"Sweetling Ursula, though thy feet have worn a\nmany miles to-day, I bid thee hasten back to the company and tell\nRichard that it is as I said, to wit, that friends, and good guesting\nawait them; so let them hasten hither and come within gates at once.\nFor as for me, I have sworn it that I will not go one step back till I\nhave seen my father and mother in their house of Upmeads.  Is it well\nsaid, Clement?\"  \"Yea, forsooth,\" said Clement; but he could not take\nhis eyes off Ursula's loveliness, as she kilted her skirts and ran her\nways like one of Diana's ladies in the wildwood.  At last he said,\n\"Thou shalt wot, fair sir, that ye will have a little band to go with\nthee from us of Wulstead; forsooth we had gone to-morrow morn in any\ncase, but since thou art here, all is well.\" Even as he spake a great\nshout broke out from the company as Ursula had given her message, and\nthen came the tramp of men and horses and the clash of weapons as they\nset forward; and Clement looked and beheld how first of all the array\ncame Ursula, bearing the hallowed staff in her hand; for her heart also\nwas set on what was to come.  Then cried out Clement: \"Happy art thou,\nlord, and happy shalt thou be, and who shall withstand thee?  Lo! what\na war-duke it is! and what a leader that marches with fate in her hands\nbefore thine host!\"\n\nTherewith were they all joined together, and Ursula gave the guisarme\ninto Ralph's hand, and with his other hand he took hers, and the bar of\nthe barrier was lifted and the gates thrown open, and they all streamed\ninto the street, the champions coming last and towering over the\nfootmen as they sat, big men on their big horses, as if they were very\nbodyguards of the God of War.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\nRalph Sees His Father and Mother Again\n\n\nThus came they into the market-place of Wulstead nigh to Clement's\nhouse, and there the company stood in ordered ranks.  Ralph looked\nround about half expecting to see his gossip standing in the door; but\nClement smiled and said: \"Thou art looking round for thy gossip, fair\nsir; but she is upon the north gate in war-gear; for we be too few in\nWulstead to spare so clean-limbed and strong-armed a dame from our\nmuster; but she shall be here against thou comest back from the Austin\nCanons, wither forsooth thou mayst go at once if thou wilt let me be\nmaster in the matter of lodging.\" Said Ralph, smiling:  \"Well, Ring of\nWulstead, since thou givest leave I will e'en take it, nor needest thou\ngive me any guide to the House of St. Austin, for I know it well.\nSweetheart,\" said he, turning to Ursula, \"what sayest thou: wilt thou\ncome with me, or abide till to-morrow, when I shall show thee to my\nkinsmen?\"  \"Nay,\" she said, \"I will with thee at once, my lord, if thou\nwilt be kind and take me; for meseemeth I also have a word to say to\nthy father, and the mother that bore thee.\"\n\n\"And thou, Hugh,\" said Ralph, \"what sayest thou?\"  \"Why, brother,\" said\nHugh, \"I think my blessing will abide the morrow's morn, for I have\nnought so fair and dear to show our father and mother as thou hast.\nAlso to-morrow thou wilt have more to do; since thou art a captain, and\nI but a single varlet.\"  And he smiled a little sourly on Ralph; who\nheeded it little, but took Ursula's hand and went his way with her.\n\nIt was but a few minutes for them to come to the House of the Canons,\nwhich was well walled toward the fields at the west of the town, so\nthat it was its chief defence of that side.  It was a fair house with a\nchurch but just finished, and Ralph could see down the street its new\nwhite pinnacles and the cross on its eastern gable rising over the\nridge of the dortoir.  They came to the gate, and round about it were\nstanding men-at-arms not a few, who seemed doughty enough at first\nsight; but when Ralph looked on them he knew some of them, that they\nwere old men, and somewhat past warlike deeds, for in sooth they were\ncarles of Upmeads.  Him they knew not, for he had somewhat cast down\nthe visor of his helm; but they looked eagerly on the fair lady and the\ngoodly knight.\n\nSo Ralph spake to the porter and bade him show him where was King Peter\nof Upmeads and his Lady wife; and the porter made him obeisance and\ntold him that they were in the church, wherein was service toward; and\nbade him enter.  So they went in and entered the church, and it was\nsomewhat dim, because the sun was set, and there were many pictures,\nand knots of flowers in the glass of the windows.\n\nSo they went halfway down the nave, and stood together there; and the\nwhole church was full of the music that the minstrels were making in\nthe rood-loft, and most heavenly sweet it was; and as Ralph stood there\nhis heart heaved with hope and love and the sweetness of his youth; and\nhe looked at Ursula, and she hung her head, and he saw that her\nshoulders were shaken with sobs; but he knew that it was with her as\nwith him, so he spake no word to her.\n\nNow when his eyes cleared and he was used to the twilight of the\nchurch, he looked toward the choir, and saw near to the Jesus altar a\nman and a woman standing together even as they were standing, and they\nwere somewhat stricken in years.  So presently he knew that this would\nbe his father and mother; so he stood still and waited till the service\nshould be over; and by then it was done the twilight was growing fast\nin the church, and the sacristan was lighting a lamp here and there in\nsome of the chapels, and the aisles of the choir.\n\nSo King Peter and his wife turned and came slowly down the nave, and\nwhen they were come anigh, Ralph spake aloud, and said: \"Hail, King\nPeter of Upmeads!\"  And the old man stopped and said unto him: \"Yea,\nforsooth, my name is Peter, and my business is to be a king, or a\nkinglet rather; and once it seemed no such hard craft; but now it all\ngoes otherwise, and belike my craft has left me; even as it fares with\na leech when folk are either too well or too ill to need his\nleech-craft.\"\n\nThen he looked at Ralph and at Ursula, and said:  \"Either my eyes are\nworse than I deemed yesterday, or thou art young, and a gallant knight,\nand she that is standing by thee is young, and fair.  Ah, lad! time was\nwhen I would have bid thee come home, thou and thy sweetling, to my\nhouse with me, and abide there in ease and feastfully; but now the best\nrede I can give thee is to get thee gone from the land, for there is\nall unpeace in it.  And yet, forsooth, friend, I know not where to send\nthee to seek for peace, since Upmeads hath failed us.\"\n\nWhile he spoke, and Ralph was sore moved by the sound of his voice, and\nhis speech wherein kindness and mocking was so blended, the Dame of\nUpmeads came to Ralph and laid her hand on his arm, and said in a\npleasant voice, for she was soft-hearted and soft-spoken both: \"Will\nnot the fair young warrior and his mate do so much for an old man and\nhis wife, who have heard not tidings of their best beloved son for two\nyears well nigh, as to come with them to their chamber, and answer a\nlittle question or two as to the parts of the world they have seen of\nlate?\"\n\nRalph nodded yeasay and began to move toward the porch, the Dame of\nUpmeads sticking close to him all the time, and King Peter following\nafter and saying:  \"Yea, young man, thou mayst think the worse of me\nfor hanging about here amongst the monks, when e'en now, for all I\nknow, the battle is pitched in Upmeads; but Nicholas and all of them\nwould have it so--Yea, and all my sons are away, fair sir; though of\nthe eldest, who meseems was born with a long head, we hear that he is\nthriving, and hath grown great.\"\n\nAs he spake they were come into the porch, and passed into the open\nair, where it was still light; then the Dame turned round on Ralph and\ncaught him by the two arms and cried out and cast her arms about his\nneck; and when she could sunder herself a little from him, she said: \"O\nRalph, I deemed that I knew thy voice, but I durst not halse thee till\nI knew it was mine own flesh and blood, lest I should have died for\ngrief to think it was thee when it was not.  O son, how fair thou art!\nNow do off thy sallet that I may see thee, thy face and thy curly head.\"\n\nSo did he, smiling as one who loved her, and again she fell to kissing\nand clipping him.  Then his father came up and thrust her aside gently\nand embraced him also, and said:  \"Tell me, son, what thou are become?\nThou art grown much of a man since thou stolest thyself away from me.\nIs there aught behind this goodly raiment of thine?  And this fair\nlady, hath she stolen thee away from thy foes to bring thee home to us?\"\n\nRalph laughed and said:  \"No less than that, father; I will tell thee\nall presently; but this first, that I am the captain of a goodly\ncompany of men-at-arms; and\"----\"Ah, son, sweetheart,\" said his mother,\n\"and thou wilt be going away from us again to seek more fame: and yet,\nas I look on thee thou seemest to have grown great enough already.  I\ndeem thou wilt not leave us.\"\n\n\"Mother, my dear,\" said Ralph, \"to-morrow morn we shall go down to\nbattle in Upmeads, and the day after I shall come hither again, and\nbring you back to the High House with all honour and glory.  But look,\nmother,\" and he took Ursula's hand, \"here is a daughter and a darling\nthat I have brought back to thee, for this is my wedded wife.\"\n\nThen Ursula looked beseechingly at the Dame, who took her in her arms\nand clipped her and kissed her; and said, \"Welcome, daughter; for I\nfeel thy body that thou lovest me.\"\n\nThen said King Peter; \"Forsooth, son, she is a sweet and dainty\ncreature.  If there be a fairer than her, I wot not; but none so fair\nhave mine eyes looked on.  Tell me whose daughter she is, and of what\nlineage?\" And therewith he took her hand and kissed her.\n\nBut Ursula said:  \"I am come of no earl or baron.  I am a yeoman's\ndaughter, and both my father and my mother are dead, and I have no nigh\nkin save one brother who loveth me not, and would heed it little if he\nnever saw my face again.  Now I tell thee this:  that if my lord\nbiddeth me go from him, I will depart; but for the bidding of none else\nwill I leave him.\"\n\nKing Peter laughed and said:  \"Never will I bid thee depart.\" Then he\ntook her hand and said:  \"Sweetling, fair daughter, what is thy name?\"\n\"Ursula,\" she said.  Said he:  \"Ursula, thy palms are harder than be\nthe hands of the dainty dames of the cities, but there is no churls'\nblood in thee meseemeth.  What is thy kindred of the yeoman?\"  She\nsaid: \"We be come of the Geirings of old time:  it may be that the\nspear is broken, and the banner torn; but we forget not our\nforefathers, though we labour afield, and the barons and the earls call\nus churls.  It is told amongst us that that word is but another way of\nsaying earl and that it meaneth a man.\"\n\nThen spoke Ralph:  \"Father and mother both, I may well thank thee and\nbless thee that your eyes look upon this half of me with kind eyes.\nAnd now I shall tell thee that for this woman, her heart is greater\nthan a king's or a leader of folk.  And meseemeth her palms have\nhardened with the labour of delivering me from many troubles.\"\n\nThen the Dame of Upmeads put her arms about Ursula's neck again, and\nbade her all welcome once more, with sweet words of darling and dear,\nand well-beloved daughter.\n\nBut King Peter said:  \"Son, thou hast not told me what thou are become;\nand true it is that thou hast the look of a great one.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Father and King, I have become the Lord of the Little\nLand of Abundance, the sworn brother of the Champions of the Dry Tree,\nthe Lord of the Castle of the Scaur, the brother and Warduke of the\nShepherds; and to-morrow shall I be the Conqueror of the robbers and\nthe devils of the Burg.  And this be not enough for me, hearken!  I and\nmy wife both, yea and she leading me, have drunk of the Well at the\nWorld's End, and have become Friends thereof.\"\n\nAnd he looked at his father with looks of love, and his father drew\nnigh to him again, and embraced him once more, and stroked his cheeks\nand kissed him as if he had become a child again: \"O son,\" said he,\n\"whatsoever thou dost, that thou dost full well.  And lo, one while\nwhen I look on thee thou art my dear and sweet child, as thou wert\nyears agone, and I love thee dearly and finely; and another while thou\nart a great and mighty man, and I fear thee; so much greater thou\nseemest than we poor upland folk.\"\n\nThen smiled Ralph for love and happiness, and he said: \"Father, I am\nthy child in the house and at the board, and that is for thine helping.\nAnd I am thy champion and the fierce warrior afield, and that also is\nfor thine helping.  Be of good cheer; for thine house shall not wane,\nbut wax.\" And all those four were full of joy and their hearts were\nraised aloft.\n\nBut as they spake thus came a lay-brother and bent the knee before King\nPeter and bade him and the Dame of Upmeads to supper in the name of the\nPrior, and the Captain and the Lady therewith; for indeed the rumour of\nthe coming of an host for the helping of the countryside had gotten\ninto that House, and the Prior and the brethern sorely desired to look\nupon the Captain, not knowing him for Ralph of Upmeads.  So into the\nHall they went together, and there the holy fathers made them great\nfeast and joy; and King Peter might not refrain him, but told the Prior\nhow this was his son come back from far lands, with the goodly Lady he\nhad won to wife therein; and the Prior and all the fathers made much of\nRalph, and rejoiced in their hearts when they saw how goodly a man of\nwar he had gotten to be.  And the Prior would lead him on to tell him\nof the marvels he had seen in the far parts of the world; but Ralph\nsaid but little thereon, whereas his thought was set on the days that\nlay even before his feet; yet some deal he told him of the uncouth\nmanners of the lands beyond Whitwall, and at last he said:  \"Father,\nwhen the battles be over here, and there is peace on our lands again, I\nwill ask thee to give me guesting for a night, that I may tell thee all\nthe tale of what hath befallen me since the last summer day when I rode\nthrough Wulstead; but now I ask leave of thee to depart, for I have\nmany things to do this even, as behoveth a captain, before I sleep for\nan hour or two.  And if it be thy will, I would leave the Lady my wife\nwith my mother here at least till morrow morn.\"\n\nSo the Prior gave him leave, loth though he were, and Ralph kissed his\nfather and mother, and they blessed him.  But Ursula said to him\nsoftly: \"It is my meaning to go with thee down into Upmeads to-morrow;\nfor who knoweth what may befall thee.\"  Then he smiled upon her and\nwent his ways down the hall and out-a-gates, while all men looked on\nhim and did him worship.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\nRalph Holds Converse With Katherine His Gossip\n\n\nRalph went straight from St. Austin's to Clement's house, and found\nmuch people about the door thereof, what of the townsmen, what of the\nmen of his own host.  He passed through these, and found Clement in his\nchamber, and with him a half score of such company as was without, and\namongst them Roger and the Sage; but Stephen and Richard both were\namongst their men doing what was needful.  All men arose when Ralph\nentered; but he looked around, and could see nought of his gossip\namongst them.  Then he sat down by Clement and asked if he had any\nfresh tidings; and Clement did him to wit that there had come in a\ncarle from out of Upmeads, who had told them by sure tokens that the\nfoe were come into the Upmeads-land at noon that day, and between then\nand sunset had skirmished with Nicholas and them that were holding the\nHigh House, but had gotten nought thereby.  This man, said Clement,\nbeing both bold and of good sleight had mingled with the foe; and had\nheard the talk of them, and he said that they had no inkling of the\nShepherds or the Dry Tree coming against them; but they looked to have\naid from their own folk from the lands of Higham; wherefore they made a\nmock of the defence of the Upmeads' men; and said that since, when they\nwere all joined together in Upmeads, they might enter where they would\nwithout the loss of a half-score men, therefore they would risk nought\nnow; nor would they burn either the High House or the other steadings,\nsince, said they, they were minded to keep them sound and whole for\ntheir own.\n\nThese tidings seemed good to Ralph; so he took a cup of wine and\npledged the company, and said:  \"My masters, such of you as list to\nsleep long to-night had best be abed presently, for I warn you that the\ntrumpets will blow for departure before the sun riseth to-morrow; and\nhe that faileth to see to-morrow's battle will be sorry for his lack\nall his life long.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken they all cried hail to him, and anon arose and\nwent their ways.  Then Ralph bade Clement come with him that he might\nvisit the quarters of his men-at-arms, and see that all the leaders\nknew of the muster, and of the order of departing on the morrow; and\nClement arose and went with him.\n\nAs they were on the way Ralph asked Clement what ailed his gossip\nKatherine that she had not come to meet him already; and Clement\nlaughed and said:  \"Nought, nought; she is somewhat shamefaced to meet\nthee first amongst a many folk, and she not able belike to refrain her\nkisses and caresses to thee.  Fear not, she is in her bower-aloft, and\nwe shall find her there when we come back from our errand; fear not!\nshe will not sleep till she hath had her arms about thee.\" \"Good is\nthat,\" said Ralph; \"I had looked to see her ere now; but when we meet\napart from folk, something we shall be able to say to each other, which\nbelike neither she nor I had liked to leave unsaid till we meet again.\"\n\nSo came they to the chief quarters of the fighting men, and Ralph had\nall the leaders called to him, and he spake to them of how they should\ndo on the morrow, both footmen and horsemen, whatwise they should stand\ntogether, and how they should fall on; and he told them all as clearly\nas if he were already in the field with the foe before him; so that\nthey wondered at him, so young in years, being so old in the wisdom of\nwar.  Withal they saw of him that he had no doubt but that they should\ncome to their above on the morrow; and all men, not only of the tried\nmen-at-arms of the Dry Tree, but they of the Shepherds also, even those\nof them who had never stricken a stroke in anger, were of high heart\nand feared not what should befall.\n\nSo when all this business was over, they turned about and came their\nways home to Clement's house again.\n\nThey saw lights in the chamber or ever they entered, and when they came\nto the door, lo! there within was Katherine walking up and down the\nfloor as if she knew not how to contain herself.  She turned and saw\nRalph at the door, and she cried aloud and ran towards him with arms\noutspread.  But when she drew nigh to him and beheld him closely, she\nwithheld her, and falling down on her knees before him took his hand\nand fell to kissing it and weeping and crying out, \"O my lord, my lord,\nthou art come again to us!\" But Ralph stooped down to her, and lifted\nher up, and embraced her and kissed her on the cheeks and the mouth,\nand led her to the settle and sat down beside her and put his arm about\nher; and Clement looked on smiling, and sat him down over against them.\n\nThen spake Katherine:  \"O my lord! how great and masterful hast thou\ngrown; never did I hope to see thee come back so mighty a man.\" And\nagain she wept for joy; but Ralph kissed her again, and she said,\nlaughing through her tears:  \"Master Clement, this lord and warrior\nhath brought back with him something that I have not seen; and belike\nhe hath had one fair woman in his arms, or more it may be, since I saw\nhim last.  For though he but kisses me as his gossip and foster-mother,\nyet are his kisses closer and kinder than they were aforetime.\"\n\nSaid Clement:  \"Sooth is the Sage's guess; yet verily, fair sir, I have\ntold her somewhat of thy journeys, so far as I knew of them.\"\n\nSaid Katherine:  \"Dear lord and gossip, wilt thou not tell me more\nthereof now?\"\n\n\"What!\" said Ralph; \"shall I not sleep to-night?\"\n\n\"Dear gossip,\" she said, \"thou art over-mighty to need sleep.  And ah!\nI had forgotten in the joy of our meeting that to-morrow thou goest to\nbattle; and how if thou come not again?\"\n\n\"Fear nought,\" said Ralph; \"art thou not somewhat foreseeing?  Dost\nthou not know that to-morrow or the day after I shall come back unhurt\nand victorious; and then shall both thou and Clement come to Upmeads\nand abide there as long as ye will; and then shall I tell thee a many\ntales of my wanderings; and Ursula my beloved, she also shall tell\nthee.\"\n\nKatherine reddened somewhat, but she said:  \"Would I might kiss her\nfeet, dear lord.  But now, I pray thee, tell me somewhat, now at once.\"\n\n\"So shall it be,\" said Ralph, \"since thou wilt have it, dear gossip;\nbut when I have done I shall ask thee to tell me somewhat, whereof hath\nlong been wonder in my mind; and meseemeth that by the time we are both\ndone with tales, I shall needs be putting on my helm again.--Nay, again\nI tell thee it is but a show of battle that I go to!\"\n\nSo then he went and sat by Clement's side, and began and told over as\nshortly as might be the tidings of his journeys.  And oft she wept for\npity thereat.\n\nBut when he was done and he had sat beholding her, and saw how goodly a\nwoman she was, and how straight and well knit of body, he said:\n\"Gossip, I wonder now, if thou also hast drunk of the Well; for thou\nart too fair and goodly to be of the age that we call thee.  How is\nthis!  Also tell me how thou camest by this pair of beads that seem to\nhave led me to the Well at the World's End?  For as I said e'en now, I\nhave long marvelled how thou hadst them and where.\"\n\n\"Fair sir,\" said Clement, \"as for her drinking of the Well at the\nWorld's End, it is not so; but this is a good woman, and a valiant, and\nof great wisdom; and such women wear well, even as a well-wrought piece\nof armour that hath borne many strokes of the craftsman's hand, and\nhath in it some deal of his very mind and the wisdom of him.  But now\nlet her tell thee her tale (which forsooth I know not), for night is\ngrowing old.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\nDame Katherine Tells of the Pair of Beads, and Whence She Had Them\n\n\nKatherine cast friendly looks on them and said:  \"Gossip, and thou,\nClement, I will make a clean breast of it once for all.  In the days\nwhen I was first wedded to Master Clement yonder, he found his bed cold\nwithout me, for he was a hot lover; therefore would he often have me\nwith him on his journeys, how hard soever or perilous the way might be.\nYea, Clement, thou lookest the sooth, though thou sayest it not, I was\nnought loth thereto, partly because I would not grieve thee, my man;\nbut partly, and belike mostly, because I was wishful to see the ways of\nthe world even at the risk of being thrust out of the world.  So it\nbefell us on a time to make a journey together, a journey exceeding\nlong, in the company of certain chapmen, whereof some, and not a few,\ndied on the way.  But we lived, and came into the eastern parts of the\nearth to a city right ancient, and fulfilled of marvels, which hight\nSarras the Holy.  There saw we wonders whereof were it overlong to tell\nof here; but one while I will tell thee, my lord.  But this I must\nneeds say, that I heard tell of a woman dwelling there, who was not old\nby seeming, but had in her the wisdom of ten lives, and the longing gat\nhold of me to see her and learn wisdom of her.  So I entreated many who\nwere called wise, some with prayers, and some with gifts also, to help\nme to speech of her; but I gat nothing either by praying or giving;\nthey that would have helped me could not, and they that could would\nnot.  So, what between one thing and another, the longing to see the\nWise Woman grew as it were into a madness in me.  Amidst of which we\nfell in with a merchant exceeding wise in ancient lore, who looked at\nme (though Clement knew it not) with eyes of love.  Of this man I asked\nconcerning the Wise Woman, and he seeing my desire, strove to use it\nmerchant-like, and would deal with me and have in payment for his\nlearning a gift which I had nought to do to give.  Howbeit madness and\nmy desire for speech with the Wise Woman got the better of me, and I\npromised to give no less than he would, trusting to beguile him after I\nhad got my desire, and be quit of him.  So he led me to the woman and\nwent his ways.  She dwelt all by herself in a nook of an ancient ruined\npalace, erst the house of the ancientest of all the kings of Sarras.\nWhen I came to her, I saw nought dreadful or ugsome about her: she was\ncheerful of countenance and courteous of demeanour, and greeted me\nkindly as one neighbour in the street of Wulstead might do to another.\nI saw her, that she was by seeming a woman of some forty winters, trim\nand well-fashioned of body, nowise big, but slender, of dark red hair\nand brown eyes somewhat small.\n\n\"Now, she said to me, 'I have looked for thee a while; now thou art\ncome, thou shalt tell me what thou needest, and thy needs will I\nfulfil.  Yet needs must thou do a thing for me in return, and maybe\nthou wilt deem it a great thing.  Yet whereas thou has struck a bargain\nbefore thou camest hither, if I undo that for thee, the bargain with me\nmay be nought so burdensome.  How sayest thou?'\n\n\"Well, I saw now that I was in the trap, for ill had it been in those\ndays had Clement come to know that I had done amiss; for he was a\njealous lover, and a violent man.\"\n\nClement smiled hereat, but said nought, and Katherine went on: \"Trap or\nno trap, if I were eager before, I was over-eager now; so when she bade\nme swear to do her will, I swore it without tarrying.\n\n\"Then she said:  'Sit down before me, and I will teach thee wisdom.'\nWhat did she teach me? say ye.  Well, if I told you belike ye would be\nnone the wiser; but so much she told me, that my heart swelled with joy\nof the wisdom which I garnered.  Say thou, Clement, if I have been the\nworser woman to thee, or thy friends, or mine.\"\n\n\"Nay, goodwife,\" said Clement, \"I have nought against thee.\"\n\nKatherine laughed and went on:\n\n\"At last the Wise Woman said, 'Now that thou hast of me all that may\navail thee, comes the other part of our bargain, wherein I shall take\nand thou shalt give.'\n\n\"Quoth I, 'That is but fair, and thou shalt find me true to thee.' She\nsaid, 'If thou be not, I shall know it, and shall amend it in such wise\nthat it shall cost thee much.'\n\n\"Then she looked on me long and keenly, and said afterward: 'Forsooth I\nshould forbear laying this charge upon thee if I did not deem that thou\nwouldst be no less than true.  But now I will try it, whereas I deem\nthat the days of my life henceforward shall not be many; and many days\nwould it take me to find a woman as little foolish as thee and as\nlittle false, and thereto as fairly fashioned.'\n\n\"Therewith she put her hand to her neck, and took thence the self-same\npair of beads which I gave to thee, dear gossip, and which (praise be\nto All Hallows!) thou hast borne ever since; and she said:  'Now\nhearken!  Thou shalt take this pair of beads, and do with them as I bid\nthee.  Swear again thereto.'  So I swore by All Angels; and she said\nagain: 'This pair of beads shall one day lead a man unto the Well at\nthe World's End, but no woman; forsooth, if a woman have them of a\nwoman, or the like of them, (for there be others,) they may serve her\nfor a token; but will be no talisman or leading-stone to her; and this\nI tell thee lest thou seek to the Well on the strength of them.  For I\nbid thee give them to a man that thou lovest--that thou lovest well,\nwhen he is in most need; only he shall not be of thine own blood.  This\nis all that I lay upon thee; and if thou do it, thou shalt thrive, and\nif thou do it not, thou shalt come to harm.  And I will tell thee now\nthat this meeting betwixt us is not by chance-hap, but of my bringing\nabout; for I have laboured to draw thee to me, knowing that thou alone\nof women would avail me herein.  Now shalt thou go home to thine\nhostel, and take this for a token of my sooth-saying. The wise merchant\nwho led thee unto me is abiding thine homecoming that he may have of\nthee that which thou promisedst to him.  If then thou find him at thine\nhostel, and he take thee by the hand and lead thee to bed, whereas\nClement is away till to-morrow even, then shalt thou call me a vain\nword-spinner and a liar; but if when thou comest home there, the folk\nthere say to thee merchant Valerius is ridden away hastily, being\ncalled afar on a message of life and death, then shalt thou trow in me\nas a wise woman.  Herewith depart, and I bid thee farewell.'\n\n\"So I went my ways to my hostel trembling, and at the door I met the\nchamberlain, who said to me, 'Lady, the merchant Valerius hath been\nhere seeking thee, and he said that he would abide thy coming; but\namidst of his abiding cometh a man who would speak to him privily;\nwhereof it came that he called for his horse and bade me tell thee,\nLady, that he was summoned on a matter of life and death, and would\nreturn to kiss thine hands in five days' space.'\n\n\"So I wotted that the woman had spoken sooth, and was wise and\nforeseeing, and something of a dread of her came upon me.  But the next\neven back cometh Clement, and the day after we rode away from Sarras\nthe Holy, and Valerius I saw never again.  And as to the beads, there\nis nought to tell of them till they came into thine hands; and\nsomething tells me that it was the will of the Wise Woman that to no\nother hands they should come.\"\n\nHere Katherine made an end, and both the men sat pondering her tale a\nlittle.  As for Ralph, he deemed it certain that the Wise Woman of\nSarras would be none other than she who had taught lore to the Lady of\nAbundance; but why she should have meant the beads for him he wotted\nnot.  Again he wondered how it was that the Lady of Abundance should\nhave given the beads to Ursula, and whether she knew that they had no\nmight to lead her to the Well at the World's End.  And yet further he\nwondered how it was that Ursula, unholpen by the talisman, should have\ndone so much to bring him to the Well; yea, and how she was the first\nto see it while he slept.  But his heart told him that whereas he was\nseeking the Well with her, she must needs come thither with him, unless\nthey were both cast away; withal Katherine looked at him and said:\n\"Yea, dear lord, I wot what thou art thinking of; but couldest thou\nhave left her, when thou hadst once found her again, Well or no Well?\"\n\"Sooth is that,\" said Ralph, \"yet for all that she hath done without\nhelp of talisman or witchcraft is she the more worshipful and the\ndearer.\"\n\nThen speech came into Clement's mouth, and he said:  \"Wife, it is as I\nsaid before, when thy gossip had just departed from us.  It was meet\nenough that thou shouldst have loved him better than me; but now it is\neven less to be undone than ever, when he has come back bringing with\nhim a woman so valiant and lovely as is my Lady Ursula.  So thou must\ne'en take the life that fate hath sent thee.\" Katherine laughed through\nher tears, and said:  \"Withal, goodman, I have been no bad wife to\nthee.  And moreover, look thou, gossip dear: when I was wandering about\nwith Clement amongst many perils, when our need seemed sorest, then\nwould I think to give the beads to Clement; but so soon as I began to\nspeak to him of the Well at the World's End he would belittle the tale\nof it, and would bid me look to it if it were not so, that where the\nworld endeth the clouds begin.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Ralph lifted up his hand and pointed to the window, and\nsaid: \"Friends, as we were speaking of all these marvels we were\nforgetting the need of Upmeads and the day of battle; and lo now! how\nthe dawn is widening and the candles fading.\"\n\nScarce were the words out of his mouth, when on the quietness of the\nbeginning of day brake out the sound of four trumpets, which were\nsounding in the four quarters of the town, and blowing men to the\ngathering.  Then rose up both Ralph and Clement and took their weapons,\nand they kissed Katherine and went soberly out-a-doors into the\nmarket-place, where already weaponed men were streaming in to the\nmuster.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\nThey Go Down to Battle in Upmeads\n\n\nBefore it was light were all men come into the market-place, and Ralph\nand Richard and Clement and Stephen a-Hurst fell to and arrayed them\nduly; and now, what with the company which Ralph had led into Wulstead,\nwhat with the men of the town, and them that had fled from Upmeads\n(though these last were mostly old men and lads), they were a thousand\nand four score and three.  Ralph would go afoot as he went yesterday;\nbut today he bore in his hand the ancient staff of war, the\ngold-written guisarme; and he went amongst the Shepherds, with whom\nwere joined the feeble folk of Upmeads, men whom he had known of old\nand who knew him, and it was as if their hearts had caught fire from\nhis high heart, and that whatever their past days had been to them,\nthis day at least should be glorious.  Withal anon comes Ursula from\nSt. Austin's with the Sage of Swevenham, whose face was full smiling\nand cheerful.  Ursula wore that day a hauberk under her gown, and was\nhelmed with a sallet; and because of her armour she rode upon a little\nhorse.  Ralph gave her into the warding of the Sage, who was armed at\nall points, and looked a valiant man of war.  But Ralph's brother,\nHugh, had gotten him a horse, and had fallen into the company of the\nChampions, saying that he deemed they would go further forth than a\nsort of sheep-tending churls and the runaways of Upmeads.\n\nAs for Ralph, he walked up and down the ranks of the stout men of the\nDown-country, and saw how they had but little armour for defence,\nthough their weapons for cutting and thrusting looked fell and handy.\nSo presently he turned about to Giles, who, as aforesaid, bore a long\nhauberk, and said:  \"Friend, the walk we are on to-day is a long one\nfor carrying burdens, and an hour after sunrise it will be hot.  Wilt\nthou not do with thy raiment as I do?\"  And therewith he did off his\nhauberk and his other armour save his sallet.  \"This is good,\" said he,\n\"for the sun to shine on, so that I may be seen from far; but these\nother matters are good for folk who fight a-horseback or on a wall; we\nstriders have no need of them.\"\n\nThen arose great shouting from the Shepherds, and men stretched out the\nhand to him and called hail on his valiant heart.\n\nAmidst of which cries Giles muttered, but so as Ralph might hear him:\n\"It is all down hill to Upmeads; I shall take off my iron-coat coming\nback again.\"  So Ralph clapped him on the shoulder and bade him come\nback whole and well in any case.  \"Yea, and so shalt thou come back,\"\nsaid he.\n\nThen the horns blew for departure, and they went their ways out of the\nmarket-place, and out into the fields through the new wooden wall of\nWulstead.  Richard led the way with a half score of the Champions, but\nhe rode but a little way before Ralph, who marched at the head of the\nShepherds.\n\nSo they went in the fresh morning over the old familiar fields, and\nstrange it seemed to Ralph that he was leading an host into the little\nland of Upmeads.  Speedily they went, though in good order, and it was\nbut a little after sunrise when they were wending toward the brow of\nthe little hill whence they would look down into the fair meads whose\nimage Ralph had seen on so many days of peril and weariness.\n\nAnd now Richard and his fore-riders had come up on to the brow and sat\nthere on their horses clear against the sky; and Ralph saw how Richard\ndrew his sword from the scabbard and waved it over his head, and he and\nhis men shouted; then the whole host set up a great shout, and hastened\nup the bent, but with the end of their shout and the sound of the tramp\nof their feet and the rattle of their war-gear was mingled a confused\nnoise of cries a way off, and the blowing of horns, and as Ralph and\nhis company came crowding up on to the brow, he looked down and saw the\nhappy meadows black with weaponed men, and armour gleaming in the clear\nmorning, and the points of weapons casting back the low sun's rays and\nglittering like the sparks in a dying fire of straw.  Then again he\nlooked, and lo! the High House rising over the meadows unburned and\nunhurt, and the banner of the fruited tree hanging forth from the\ntopmost tower thereof.\n\nThen he felt a hand come on to his cheek, and lo, Ursula beside him,\nher cheeks flushed and her eyes glittering; and she cried out: \"O thine\nhome, my beloved, thine home!\"  And he turned to her and said; \"Yea,\npresently, sweetheart!\"  \"Ah,\" she said, \"will it be long? and they so\nmany!\"  \"And we so mighty!\" said Ralph.  \"Nay, it will be but a little\nwhile.  Wise man of Swevenham, see to it that my beloved is anigh me\nto-day, for where I am, there will be safety.\"\n\nThe Sage nodded yeasay and smiled.\n\nThen Ralph looked along the ridge to right and left of him, and saw\nthat all the host had come up and had a sight of the foemen; on the\nright stood the Shepherds staring down into the meadow and laughing for\nthe joy of battle and the rage of the oppressed.  On the left sat the\nChampions of the Dry Tree on their horses, and they also were tossing\nup their weapons and roaring like lions for the prey; and down below\nthe black crowd had drawn together into ordered ranks, and still the\nclamour and rude roaring of the warriors arose thence, and beat against\nthe hill's brow.\n\nNow so fierce and ready were the men of Ralph's company that it was a\nnear thing but that they, and the Shepherds in especial, did not rush\ntumultuously down the hill all breathless and in ill order.  But Ralph\ncried out to Richard to go left, and Giles to go right, and stay the\nonset for a while; and to bid the leaders come to him where he stood.\nThen the tumult amidst his folk lulled, and Stephen a-Hurst and Roger\nand three others of the Dry Tree came to him, and Giles brought three\nof the Shepherds, and there was Clement and a fellow of his.  So when\nthey were come and standing in a ring round Ralph, he said to them:\n\n\"Brothers in arms, ye see that our foes are all in array to meet us,\nhaving had belike some spy in Wulstead, who hath brought them the tale\nof what was toward.  Albeit methinks that this irks not either you nor\nme; for otherwise we might have found them straggling, and scattered\nfar and wide, which would have made our labour the greater.  Now ye can\nsee with your eyes that they are many more than we be, even were\nNicholas to issue out of the High House against them, as doubtless he\nwill do if need be.  Brethren, though they be so many, yet my heart\ntells me that we shall overcome them; yet if we leave our strength and\ncome down to them, both our toil shall be greater, and some of us,\nbelike many, shall be slain; and evil should I deem it if but a score\nof my friends should lose their lives on this joyous day when at last I\nsee Upmeads again after many troubles.  Wherefore my rede is that we\nabide their onset on the hillside here; and needs must they fall on us,\nwhereas we have Wulstead and friends behind us, and they nought but\nNicholas and the bows and bills of the High House.  But if any have\naught to say against it let him speak, but be speedy; for already I see\na stir in their array, and I deem that they will send men to challenge\nus to come down to them.\"\n\nThen spake Stephen a-Hurst: \"I, and we all meseemeth, deem that thou\nart in the right, Captain; though sooth to say, when we first set eyes\non these dogs again, the blood so stirred in us that we were like to\nlet all go and ride down on them.\"\n\nSaid Richard:  \"Thou biddest us wisdom of war; let them have the hill\nagainst them.\"  Said Clement:  \"Yea, for they are well learned and well\narmed; another sort of folk to those wild men whom we otherthrew in the\nmountains.\"\n\nAnd in like wise said they all.\n\nThen spake Stephen again:  \"Lord, since thou wilt fight afoot with our\nfriends of the Shepherds, we of the Dry Tree are minded to fare in like\nwise and to forego our horses; but if thou gainsay it----\"\n\n\"Champion,\" said Ralph, \"I do gainsay it.  Thou seest how many of them\nbe horsed, and withal ye it is who must hold the chase of them; for I\nwill that no man of them shall escape.\"\n\nThey laughed joyously at his word, and then he said: \"Go now, and give\nyour leaders of scores and tens the word that I have said, and come\nback speedily for a little while; for now I see three men sundering\nthem from their battle, and one beareth a white cloth at the end of his\nspear; these shall be the challengers.\"\n\nSo they did after his bidding, and by then they had come back to Ralph\nthose three men were at the foot of the hill, which was but low.  Then\nRalph said to his captains: \"Stand before me, so that I be not seen of\nthem until one of you hath made answer, 'Speak of this to our leader\nand captain.'\" Even so they did; and presently those three came so nigh\nthat they could see the whites of their eyes.  They were all three well\narmed, but the foremost of them was clad in white steel from head to\nfoot, so that he looked like a steel image, all but his face, which was\npale and sallow and grim.  He and his two fellows, when they were right\nnigh, rode slowly all along the front of Ralph's battles thrice, and\nnone spake aught to them, and they gave no word to any; but when they\ncame over against the captains who stood before Ralph for the fourth\ntime, they reined up and faced them, and the leader put back his sallet\nand spake in a great and rough voice:\n\n\"Ye men! we have heard these three hours that ye were coming, wherefore\nwe have drawn out into the meads which we have taken, that ye might see\nhow many and how valiant we be, and might fear us.  Wherefore now, ye\nbroken reivers of the Dry Tree, ye silly shepherds of silly sheep, ye\nweavers and apprentices of Wulstead, and if there by any more, ye\nfools! we give you two choices this morn.  Either come down to us into\nthe meadow yonder, that we may slay you with less labour, or else,\nwhich will be the better for you, give up to us the Upmeads thralls who\nbe with you, and then turn your faces and go back to your houses, and\nabide there till we come and pull you out of them, which may be some\nwhile yet.  Hah! what say ye, fools?\"\n\nThen spake Clement and said:  \"Ye messengers of the robbers and\noppressors, why make ye this roaring to the common people and the\nsergeants?  Why speak ye not with our Captain?\"\n\nCried out the challenger, \"Where then is the Captain of the Fools?  is\nhe hidden? can he hear my word?\"\n\nScarce was it out of his mouth ere the captains fell away to right and\nleft, and there, standing by himself, was Ralph, holding the ancient\nlettered war-staff; his head was bare, for now he had done off his\nsallet, and the sun and the wind played in his bright hair; glorious\nwas his face, and his grey eyes gleamed with wrath and mastery as he\nspake in a clear voice, and there was silence all along the ranks to\nhearken him:\n\n\"O messenger of the robbers!  I am the captain of this folk.  I see\nthat the voice hath died away within the jaws of you; but it matters\nnot, for I have heard thy windy talk, and this is the answer:  we will\nneither depart, nor come down to you, but will abide our death by your\nhands here on this hill-side.  Go with this answer.\"\n\nThe man stared wild at Ralph while he was speaking, and seemed to\nstagger in his saddle; then he let his sallet fall over his face, and,\nturning his horse about, rode swiftly, he and his two fellows, down the\nhill and away to the battle of the Burgers.  None followed or cried\nafter him; for now had a great longing and expectation fallen upon\nRalph's folk, and they abode what shall befall with little noise.  They\nnoted so soon as the messenger was gotten to the main of the foemen\nthat there was a stir amongst them, and they were ordering their ranks\nto move against the hill.  And withal they saw men all armed coming\nfrom out the High House, who went down to the Bridge and abode there.\nUpmeads-water ran through the meadows betwixt the hill and the High\nHouse, as hath been said afore; but as it winded along, one reach of it\nwent nigh to the House, and made wellnigh a quarter of a circle about\nit before it turned to run down the meadows to the eastward; and at\nthis nighest point was there a wide bridge well builded of stone.\n\nThe Burg-devils heeded not the men at the Bridge, but, being all\narrayed, made but short tarrying (and that belike only to hear the tale\nof their messenger) ere they came in two battles straight across the\nmeadow.  They on their right were all riders, and these faced the\nChampions of the Dry Tree, but a great battle of footmen came against\nthe Shepherds and the rest of Ralph's footmen, but in their rearward\nwas a company of well-horsed men-at-arms; and all of them were well\narmed and went right orderly and warrior-like.\n\nIt was but some fifteen minutes ere they were come to the foot of the\nhill, and they fell to mounting it with laughter and mockery, but\nRalph's men held their peace.  The horsemen were somewhat speedier than\nthose on foot, though they rode but at a foot's pace, and when they\nwere about halfway up the hill and were faltering a little (for it was\nsomewhat steep, though nought high), the Champions of the Dry Tree\ncould forbear them no longer, but set up a huge roar, and rode at them,\nso that they all went down the hill together, but the Champions were\nlost amidst of the huge mass of the foemen.\n\nBut Ralph was left at the very left end of his folk, and the foemen\ncame up the hill speedily with much noise and many foul mocks as\naforesaid, and they were many and many more than Ralph's folk, and now\nthat the Champions were gone, could have enfolded them at either end;\nbut no man of the company blenched or faltered, only here and there one\nspake soft to his neighbour, and here and there one laughed the\nbattle-laugh.\n\nNow at the hanging of the hill, whenas either side could see the whites\nof the foemen's eyes, the robbers stayed a little to gather breath; and\nin that nick of time Ralph strode forth into the midst between the two\nlines and up on to a little mound on the hill-side (which well he\nknew), and he lifted up the ancient guisarme, and cried on high:  \"Home\nnow!  Home to Upmeads!\"\n\nThen befell a marvel, for even as all eyes of the foemen were turned on\nhim, straightway their shouts and jeering and laughter fell dead, and\nthen gave place to shrieks and wailing, as all they who beheld him cast\ndown their weapons and fled wildly down the hill, overturning whatever\nstood in their way, till the whole mass of them was broken to pieces,\nand the hill was covered with nought but cravens and the light-footed\nShepherds slaughtering them in the chase.\n\nBut Ralph called Clement to him and they drew a stalworth band\ntogether, and, heeding nought the chase of the runaways, they fell on\nthose who had the Champions in their midst, and fell to smiting down\nmen on either hand; and every man who looked on Ralph crouched and\ncowered before him, casting down his weapons and throwing up his hands.\nShortly to say it, when these horsemen felt this new onset, and looking\nround saw their men fleeing hither and thither over the green fields of\nUpmeads, smitten by the Shepherds and leaping into the deep pools of\nthe river, they turned and fled, every man who could keep his saddle,\nand made for the Bridge, the Dry Tree thundering at their backs.  But\neven as they came within bowshot, a great flight of arrows came from\nthe further side of the water, and the banner of the Fruitful Tree came\nforth from the bridge-end with Nicholas and his tried men-at-arms\nbehind it; and then indeed great and grim was the murder, and the proud\nmen of the Burg grovelled on the ground and prayed for mercy till\nneither the Champions nor the men of Nicholas could smite helpless men\nany longer.\n\nNow had Ralph held his hand from the chase, and he was sitting on a\nmound amidst of the meadow under an ancient thorn, and beside him sat\nthe Sage of Swevenham and Ursula.  And she was grown pale now and\nlooked somewhat scared, and she spake in a trembling voice to Ralph,\nand said: \"Alas friend! that this should be so grim!  When we hear the\nowls a-nighttime about the High House, shall we not deem at whiles that\nit is the ghosts of this dreadful battle and slaughter wandering about\nour fair fields?\" But Ralph spake sternly and wrathfully as he sat\nthere bareheaded and all unarmed save for the ancient glaive: \"Why did\nthey not slay me then?  Better the ghosts of robbers in our fields by\nnight, than the over-burdened hapless thrall by day, and the scourged\nwoman, and ruined child.  These things they sought for us and have\nfound death on the way--let it be!\"\n\nHe laughed as he spake; but then the grief of the end of battle came\nupon him and he trembled and shook, and great tears burst from his eyes\nand rolled down his cheeks, and he became stark and hard-faced.\n\nThen Ursula took his hands and caressed them, and kissed his face, and\nfell a-talking to him of how they rode the pass to the Valley of Sweet\nChestnuts; and in a while his heart and his mind came back to him as it\ndid that other time of which she spake, and he kissed her in turn, and\nbegan to tell her of his old chamber in the turret of the High House.\n\nAnd now there come riding across the field two warriors.  They draw\nrein by the mound, and one lights down, and lo! it is Long Nicholas;\nand he took Ralph in his arms, and kissed him and wept over him for all\nhis grizzled beard and his gaunt limbs; but few words he had for him,\nsave this:  \"My little Lord, was it thou that was the wise captain\nto-day, or this stout lifter and reiver!\" But the other man was Stephen\na-Hurst, who laughed and said: \"Nay, Nicholas, I was the fool, and this\nstripling the wise warrior.  But, Lord Ralph, thou wilt pardon me, I\nhope, but we could not kill them all, for they would not fight in any\nwise; what shall we do with them?\"  Ralph knit his brows and thought a\nlittle; then he said: \"How many hast thou taken?\"  Said Stephen:  \"Some\ntwo hundred alive.\" \"Well,\" quoth Ralph; \"strip them of all armour and\nweapons, and let a score of thy riders drive them back the way they\ncame into the Debateable Wood.  But give them this last word from me,\nthat or long I shall clear the said wood of all strong-thieves.\"\n\nStephen departed on that errand; and presently comes Giles and another\nof the Shepherds with a like tale, and had a like answer.\n\nNow amidst all these deeds it yet lacked an hour of noon.  So presently\nRalph arose and took Richard apart for a while and spoke with him a\nlittle, and then came back to Ursula and took her by the hand, and\nsaid: \"Beloved, Richard shall take thee now to a pleasant abode this\nside the water; for I grudge that thou shouldst enter the High House\nwithout me; and as for me I must needs ride back to Wulstead to bring\nhither my father and mother, as I promised to do after the battle.  In\ngood sooth, I deemed it would have lasted longer.\"  Said Ursula: \"Dear\nfriend, this is even what I should have bidden thee myself.  Depart\nspeedily, that thou mayst be back the sooner; for sorely do I long to\nenter thine house, beloved.\"  Then Ralph turned to Nicholas, and said:\n\"Our host is not so great but that thou mayst victual it well; yet I\ndeem it is little less than when we left Wulstead early this morning.\"\n\n\"True is that, little lord,\" said Nicholas.  \"Hear a wonder amongst\nbattles: of thy Shepherds and the other footmen is not one slain, and\nbut some five hurt.  The Champions have lost three men slain outright,\nand some fifteen hurt; of whom is thy brother Hugh, but not sorely.\"\n\"Better than well is thy story then,\" said Ralph.  \"Now let them bring\nme a horse.\"  So when he was horsed, he kissed Ursula and went his\nways.  And she abode his coming back at Richard's house anigh the water.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\nRalph Brings His Father and Mother to Upmeads\n\n\nShort was the road back again to Wulstead, and whereas the day was not\nvery old when Ralph came there, he failed not to stop at Clement's\nhouse, and came into the chamber where sat Dame Katherine in pensive\nwise nigh to the window, with her open hands in her lap.  Quoth Ralph:\n\"Rejoice, gossip! for neither is Clement hurt, nor I, and all is done\nthat should be done.\"  She moved her but little, but the tears came\ninto her eyes and rolled down her cheeks.  \"What, gossip?\" quoth Ralph;\n\"these be scarce tears of joy; what aileth thee?\"  \"Nay,\" said\nKatherine, \"indeed I am joyful of thy tidings, though sooth to say I\nlooked for none other.  But, dear lord and gossip, forgive me my tears\non the day of thy triumph; for if they be not wholly of joy, so also\nare they not wholly of sorrow.  But love and the passing of the days\nare bittersweet within my heart to-day. Later on thou shalt see few\nfaces more cheerful and merry in the hall at Upmeads than this of thy\ngossip's. So be merry now, and go fetch thy father and thy mother, and\nrejoice their hearts that thou hast been even better than thy word to\nthem.  Farewell, gossip; but look to see me at Upmeads before many days\nare past; for I know thee what thou art; and that the days will\npresently find deeds for thee, and thou wilt be riding into peril, and\ncoming safe from out of it.  Farewell!\"\n\nSo he departed and rode to the House of St. Austin, and the folk\ngathered so about him in the street that at the gate of the Priory he\nhad to turn about and speak to them; and he said:  \"Good people,\nrejoice! there are no more foemen of Wulstead anigh you now; and take\nthis word of me, that I will see to it in time to come that ye live in\npeace and quiet here.\"\n\nFolk shouted for joy, and the fathers who were standing within the gate\nheard his word and rejoiced, and some of them ran off to tell King\nPeter that his son was come back victorious already; so that by then he\nhad dismounted at the Guest-house door, lo! there was the King and his\nwife with him, and both they alboun for departure.  And when they saw\nhim King Peter cried out: \"There is no need to say a word, my son;\nunless thou wouldst tell the tale to the holy father Prior, who, as ye\nsee, has e'en now come out to us.\"\n\nSaid Ralph:  \"Father and mother, I pray your blessing, and also the\nblessing of the father Prior here; and the tale is short enough: that\nwe have overthrown them and slain the more part, and the others are now\nbeing driven like a herd of swine into their stronghold of the Wood\nDebateable, where, forsooth, I shall be ere the world is one month\nolder.  And in the doing of all this have but three of our men been\nslain and a few hurt, amongst whom is thy son Hugh, but not sorely.\"\n\n\"O yea, son,\" said his mother, \"he shall do well enough.  But now with\nthy leave, holy Prior, we will depart, so that we may sleep in the High\nHouse to-night, and feel that my dear son's hand is over us to ward us.\"\n\nThen Ralph knelt before them, and King Peter and his wife blessed their\nson when they had kissed and embraced each other, and they wept for joy\nof him.  The Prior also, who was old, and a worthy prelate, and an\nancient friend of King Peter, might not refrain his tears at the joy of\nhis friends as he gave Ralph his blessing.  And then, when Ralph had\nrisen up and the horses were come, he said to him: \"One thing thou art\nnot to forget, young conqueror, to wit, that thou art to come here\nearly one day, and tell me all thy tale at full length.\"\n\n\"Yea, Prior,\" said Ralph, \"or there is the High House of Upmeads for\nthee to use as thine own, and a rest for thee of three or four days\nwhile thou hearkenest the tale; for it may need that.\"\n\n\"Hearken,\" said King Peter softly to the Dame, \"how he reckons it all\nhis own; my day is done, my dear.\"  He spake smiling, and she said:\n\"Soothly he is waxen masterful, and well it becometh the dear\nyoungling.\"\n\nNow they get to horse and ride their ways, while all folk blessed them.\nThe two old folk rode fast and pressed their nags whatever Ralph might\ndo to give them pastime of words; so they came into the plain field of\nUpmeads two hours before sunset; and King Peter said: \"Now I account it\nthat I have had one day more of my life than was my due, and thou, son,\nhast added it to the others whereas thou didst not promise to bring me\nhither till morrow.\"\n\nRalph led them round by the ford, so that they might not come across\nthe corpses of the robbers; but already were the Upmeads carles at work\ndigging trenches wherein to bury them.\n\nSo Ralph led his father and his mother to the gate of the garth of High\nHouse; then he got off his horse and helped them down, and as he so\ndealt with his father, he said to him: \"Thou art springy and limber\nyet, father; maybe thou wilt put on thine helm this year to ride the\nDebateable Wood with me.\"\n\nThe old man laughed and said:  \"Maybe, son; but as now it is time for\nthee to enter under our roof-tree once more.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"but go ye in and sit in the high-seat and abide me.\nFor did I not go straight back to you from the field of battle; and can\nI suffer it that any other hand than mine should lead my wife into the\nhall and up to the high-seat of my fathers; and therefore I go to fetch\nher from the house of Richard the Red where she is abiding me; but\npresently I shall lead her in, and do ye then with us what ye will.\"\n\nTherewith he turned about and rode his ways to Richard's house, which\nwas but a half-mile thence.  But his father and mother laughed when he\nwas gone, and King Peter said:  \"There again!  thou seest, wife, it is\nhe that commands and we that obey.\"\n\n\"O happy hour that so it is!\" said the Lady, \"and happy now shall be\nthe wearing of our days.\"\n\nSo they entered the garth and came into the house, and were welcomed\nwith all joy by Nicholas, and told him all that Ralph had said, and\nbade him array the house as he best might; for there was much folk\nabout the High House, though the Upmeads carles and queans had taken\nthe more part of the host to their houses, which they had delivered\nfrom the fire and sword, and they made much of them there with a good\nheart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31\n\nRalph Brings Ursula Home to the High House\n\n\nRalph speedily came to Richard's house and entered the chamber, and\nfound Ursula alone therein, clad in the daintiest of her woman's gear\nof the web of Goldburg.  She rose up to meet him, and he took her in\nhis arms, and said: \"Now is come the very ending of our journey that we\nso often longed for; and all will be ready by then we come to the High\nHouse.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, as she clung to him, \"but they were happy days the days\nof our journey; and to-morrow begins a new life.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" he said, \"but rather this even; shall it be loathly to thee,\nlady?\"\n\nShe said:  \"There will be many people whom I knew not yesterday.\"\n\"There will be but me,\" he said, \"when the night hath been dark for a\nlittle.\"\n\nShe kissed him and said nought.  And therewithal came some of Richard's\nfolk, for it was his house, and led with them a white palfrey for\nUrsula's riding, dight all gay and goodly.\n\n\"Come then,\" said Ralph, \"thou needest not to fear the ancient house,\nfor it is kind and lovely, and my father and my mother thou hast seen\nalready, and they love thee.  Come then, lest the hall be grown too\ndusk for men to see thy fairness.\"  \"Yea, yea,\" she said, \"but first\nhere is a garland I made for thee, and one also for me, while I was\nabiding thee after the battle, and my love and my hope is woven into\nit.\"  And she set it on his head, and said, \"O thou art fair, and I did\nwell to meet thee in the dark wood.\" Then he kissed her dearly on the\nmouth and led her forth, and none went with them, and they mounted and\nwent their ways.\n\nBut Ralph said:  \"I deem that we should ride the meadow to the bridge,\nbecause that way lies the great door of the hall, and if I know my\nfather and Nicholas they will look for us that way.  Dost thou yet fear\nthese dead men, sweetheart, whom our folk slew this morning?\" \"Nay,\"\nshe said, \"it has been a long time since the morning, and they, and\ntheir fieriness which has so burned out, are now to me as a tale that\nhath been told.  It is the living that I am going to, and I hope to do\nwell by them.\"\n\nCame they then to the bridge-end and there was no man there, nought but\nthe kine that were wandering about over the dewy grass of eventide.\nThen they rode over the bridge and through the orchard, and still there\nwas no man, and all gates were open wide.  So they came into the\nbase-court of the house, and it also was empty of folk; and they came\nto the great doors of the hall and they were open wide, and they could\nsee through them that the hall was full of folk, and therein by the\nlight of the low sun that streamed in at the shot-window at the other\nend they saw the faces of men and the gleam of steel and gold.\n\nSo they lighted down from their horses, and took hand in hand and\nentered bright-faced and calm, and goodly beyond the goodliness of men;\nthen indeed all that folk burst forth into glad cries, and tossed up\ntheir weapons, and many wept for joy.\n\nAs they went slowly up the long hall (and it was thirty fathom of\nlength) Ralph looked cheerfully and friendly from side to side, and\nbeheld the faces of the Shepherds and the Champions, and the men of\nWulstead, and his own folk; and all they cried hail to him and the\nlovely and valiant Lady.  Then he looked up to the high-seat, and saw\nthat his father's throne was empty, and his mother's also; but behind\nthe throne stood a knight all armed in bright armour holding the banner\nof Upmeads; but his father and mother stood on the edge of the dais to\nmeet him and Ursula; and when they came up thither these old folk\nembraced them and kissed them and led them up to the table.  Then Ralph\nbade Ursula sit by his mother, and made him ready to sit by his father\nin all love and duty.  But King Peter stayed him and said:  \"Nay, dear\nson, not there, but here shalt thou sit, thou saviour of Upmeads and\nconqueror of the hearts of men; this is a little land, but therein\nshall be none above thee.\" And therewith he set Ralph down in the\nthrone, and Ralph, turning to his left hand, saw that it was Ursula,\nand not his mother, who sat beside him.  But at the sight of these two\nin the throne the glad cries and shouts shook the very timbers of the\nroof, and the sun sank under while yet they cried hail to the King of\nUpmeads.\n\nThen were the lights brought and the supper, and all men fell to feast,\nand plenteous was the wine in the hall; and sure since first men met to\neat together none have been merrier than they.\n\nBut now when men had well eaten, and the great cup called the River of\nUpmeads was brought in, the cupbearers, being so bidden before, brought\nit last of all to King Peter, and he stood up with the River in his\nhand and spoke aloud, and said: \"Lords and warriors, and good people\nall, here I do you to wit, that it is not because my son Ralph has come\nhome to-day and wrought us a great deliverance, and that my love hath\novercome me; it is not for this cause that I have set him in my throne\nthis even; but because I see and perceive that of all the kindred he is\nmeetest to sit therein so long as he liveth; unless perchance this\nlovely and valiant woman should bear him a son even better than\nhimself--and so may it be.  Therefore I do you all to wit that this\nman is the King of Upmeads, and this woman is his Lady and Queen; and\nso deem I of his prowess, and his wisdom, and kindliness, that I trow\nhe shall be lord and servant of other lands than Upmeads, and shall\ndraw the good towns and the kindreds and worthy good lords into peace\nand might and well-being, such as they have not known heretofore.  Now\nwithin three days shall mass be sung in the choir of St. Laurence, and\nthen shall King Ralph swear on the gospels such oaths as ye wot of, to\nguard his people, and help the needy, and oppress no man, even as I\nhave sworn it.  And I say to you, that if I have kept the oath to my\npower, yet shall he keep it better, as he is mightier than I.\n\n\"Furthermore, when he hath sworn, then shall the vassals swear to him\naccording to ancient custom, to be true to him and hardy in all due\nservice.  But so please you I will not abide till then, but will kneel\nto him and to his Lady and Queen here and now.\"\n\nEven so he did, and took Ralph's hand in his and swore service to him\nsuch as was due; and he knelt to Ursula also, and bade her all thanks\nfor what she had done in the helping of his son; and they raised him up\nand made much of him and of Ralph's mother; and great was the joy of\nall folk in the hall.\n\nSo the feast went on a while till the night grew old, and folk must\nfare bedward.  Then King Peter and his wife brought Ralph and Ursula to\nthe chamber of the solar, the kingly chamber, which was well and goodly\ndight with hangings and a fair and glorious bed, and was newly decked\nwith such fair flowers as the summer might furnish; and at the\nthreshold King Peter stayed them and said: \"Kinsman, and thou, dear\nfriend, this is become your due chamber and resting-place while ye live\nin the world, and this night of all others it shall be a chamber of\nlove; for ye are, as it were, new wedded, since now first ye are come\namongst the kindred as lover and beloved; and thou, Ursula, art now at\nlast the bride of this ancient house; now tell me, doth it not look\nfriendly and kindly on thee?\"\n\n\"O yea, yea,\" she said.  \"Come thou, my man and my darling and let us\nbe alone in the master-chamber of this ancient House.\"\n\nThen Ralph drew her unto him; and the old man blessed them and prayed\nfor goodly offspring for them, that the House of Upmeads might long\nendure.\n\nAnd thus were they two left alone amidst the love and hope of the\nkindred, as erst they lay alone in the desert.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32\n\nYet a Few Words Concerning Ralph of Upmeads\n\n\nCertain it is that Ralph failed not of his promise to the good Prior of\nSt. Austin's at Wulstead, but went to see him speedily, and told him\nall the tale of his wanderings as closely as he might, and hid naught\nfrom him; which, as ye may wot, was more than one day's work or two or\nthree.  And ever when Ralph thus spoke was a brother of the House\nsitting with the Prior, which brother was a learned and wise man and\nvery speedy and deft with his pen.  Wherefore it has been deemed not\nunlike that from this monk's writing has come the more part of the tale\nabove told.  And if it be so, it is well.\n\nFurthermore, it is told of Ralph of Upmeads that he ruled over his\nlands in right and might, and suffered no oppression within them, and\ndelivered other lands and good towns when they fell under tyrants and\noppressors; and for as kind a man as he was in hall and at hearth, in\nthe field he was a warrior so wise and dreadful, that oft forsooth the\nvery sound of his name and rumour of his coming stayed the march of\nhosts and the ravage of fair lands; and no lord was ever more beloved.\nTill his deathday he held the Castle of the Scaur, and cleansed the\nWood Perilous of all strong-thieves and reivers, so that no high-street\nof a good town was safer than its glades and its byways.  The new folk\nof the Burg of the Four Friths made him their lord and captain, and the\nChampions of the Dry Tree obeyed him in all honour so long as any of\nthem lasted.  He rode to Higham and offered himself as captain to the\nabbot thereof, and drave out the tyrants and oppressors thence, and\ngave back peace to the Frank of Higham.  Ever was he true captain and\nbrother to the Shepherd-folk, and in many battles they followed him;\nand were there any scarcity or ill hap amongst them, he helped them to\nthe uttermost of his power.  The Wood Debateable also he cleared of\nfoul robbers and reivers, and rooted out the last of the Burg-devils,\nand delivered three good towns beyond the wood from the cruelty of the\noppressor.\n\nOnce in every year he and Ursula his wife visited the Land of\nAbundance, and he went into the castle there as into a holy place, and\nworshipped the memory of the Lady whom he had loved so dearly.  With\nall the friends of his quest he was kind and well-beloved.\n\nIn about two years from the day when he rode home, came to him the Lord\nBull of Utterbol with a chosen band, of whom were both Otter and\nRedhead.  That very day they came he was about putting his foot in the\nstirrup to ride against the foemen; so Bull and his men would not go\ninto the High House to eat, but drank a cup where they stood, and\nturned and rode with him straightway, and did him right manly service\nin battle; and went back with him afterwards to Upmeads, and abode with\nhim there in feasting and joyance for two months' wearing.  And thrice\nin the years that followed, when his lands at home seemed safest and\nmost at peace, Ralph took a chosen band, and Ursula with them, and\nClement withal, and journeyed through the wastes and the mountains to\nUtterbol, and passed joyous days with his old thrall of war, Bull Nosy,\nnow become a very mighty man and the warder of the peace of the\nUttermost lands.\n\nClement and Katherine came oft to the High House, and Katherine\nexceeding often; and she loved and cherished Ursula and lived long in\nhealth of body and peace of mind.\n\nAll the days that Ralph of Upmeads lived, he was the goodliest of men,\nand no man to look on him had known it when he grew old; and when he\nchanged his life, an exceeding ancient man, he was to all men's eyes in\nthe very blossom of his age.\n\nAs to Ursula his wife, she was ever as valiant and true as when they\nmet in the dark night amidst of the Eastland wood.  Eight goodly\nchildren she bore him, and saw four generations of her kindred wax up;\nbut even as it was with Ralph, never was she less goodly of body, nay\nrather, but fairer than when first she came to Upmeads; and the day\nwhereon any man saw her was a day of joyful feast to him, a day to be\nremembered for ever.  On one day they two died and were laid together\nin one tomb in the choir of St. Laurence of Upmeads.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
