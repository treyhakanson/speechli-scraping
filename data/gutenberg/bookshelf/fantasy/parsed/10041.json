He was always looking at the\ntable under the looking-glass where stood a very pretty little\nshepherdess made of china.... Close by her side stood a little\nchimney-sweep, as black as coal and also made of china.... Near\nto them stood another figure.... He was an old Chinaman who could nod\nhis head, and used to pretend he was the grandfather of the shepherdess,\nalthough he could not prove it. He, however, assumed authority over her,\nand therefore when \"Major-general-field-sergeant-commander-Billy-goat's\n-legs\" asked for the little shepherdess to be his wife, he nodded his head\nto show that he consented.\n\nThen the little shepherdess cried, and looked at her sweetheart, the\nchimney-sweep. \"I must entreat you,\" said she, \"to go out with me into\nthe wide world, for we cannot stay here.\" ... When the chimney-sweep saw\nthat she was quite firm, he said, \"My way is through the stove up the\nchimney.\" ... So at last they reached the top of the chimney.... The sky\nwith all its stars was over their heads.... They could see for a very\nlong distance out into the wide world, and the poor little shepherdess\nleaned her head on her chimney-sweep's shoulder and wept. \"This is too\nmuch,\" she said, \"the world is too large.\" ... And so with a great deal\nof trouble they climbed down the chimney and peeped out.... There lay\nthe old Chinaman on the floor ... broken into three pieces.... \"This is\nterrible,\" said the shepherdess. \"He can be riveted,\" said the\nchimney-sweep.... The family had the Chinaman's back mended and a strong\nrivet put through his neck; he looked as good as new, but when\n\"Major-General-field-sergeant-commander-Billy-goat's-legs\" again asked\nfor the shepherdess to be his wife, the old Chinaman could no longer nod\nhis head.\n\nAnd so the little china people remained together and were thankful for\nthe rivet in grandfather's neck, and continued to love each other until\nthey were broken to pieces.\n\n\n\n\nPART ONE - PROPINQUITY\n\n  _\"A singer, eh?... Well, well! but when he sings\n  Take jealous heed lest idiosyncrasies\n  Entinge and taint too deep his melodies;\n  See that his lute has no discordant strings\n  To harrow us; and let his vaporings\n  Be all of virtue and its victories,\n  And of man's best and noblest qualities,\n  And scenery, and flowers, and similar things_.\n\n  \"Thus bid our paymasters whose mutterings\n  Some few deride, and blithely link their rhymes\n  At random; and, as ever, on frail wings\n  Of wine-stained paper scribbled with such rhymes\n  Men mount to heaven, and loud laughter springs\n  From hell's midpit, whose fuel is such rhymes.\"\n\nPAUL VERVILLE. _Nascitur_.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nAt a very remote period, when editorials were mostly devoted to\ndiscussion as to whether the Democratic Convention (shortly to be held\nin Chicago) would or would not declare in favor of bi-metallism; when\ngolf was a novel form of recreation in America, and people disputed how\nto pronounce its name, and pedestrians still turned to stare after an\nautomobile; when, according to the fashion notes, \"the godet skirts and\nhuge sleeves of the present modes\" were already doomed to extinction;\nwhen the baseball season had just begun, and some of our people were\ndiscussing the national game, and others the spectacular burning of the\nold Pennsylvania Railway depot at Thirty-third and Market Street in\nPhiladelphia, and yet others the significance of General Fitzhugh Lee's\nrecent appointment as consul-general to Habana:--at this remote time,\nLichfield talked of nothing except the Pendomer divorce case.\n\nAnd Colonel Rudolph Musgrave had very narrowly escaped being named as\nthe co-respondent. This much, at least, all Lichfield knew when George\nPendomer--evincing unsuspected funds of generosity--permitted his wife\nto secure a divorce on the euphemistic grounds of \"desertion.\" John\nCharteris, acting as Rudolph Musgrave's friend, had patched up this\narrangement; and the colonel and Mrs. Pendomer, so rumor ran, were to be\nmarried very quietly after a decent interval.\n\nRemained only to deliberate whether this sop to the conventions should\nbe accepted as sufficient.\n\n\"At least,\" as Mrs. Ashmeade sagely observed, \"we can combine\nvituperation with common-sense, and remember it is not the first time a\nMusgrave has figured in an entanglement of the sort. A lecherous race!\nproverbial flutterers of petticoats! His surname convicts the man\nunheard and almost excuses him. All of us feel that. And, moreover, it\nis not as if the idiots had committed any unpardonable sin, for they\nhave kept out of the newspapers.\"\n\nHer friend seemed dubious, and hazarded something concerning \"the merest\nsense of decency.\"\n\n\"In the name of the Prophet, figs! People--I mean the people who count\nin Lichfield--are charitable enough to ignore almost any crime which is\njust a matter of common knowledge. In fact, they are mildly grateful. It\ngives them something to talk about. But when detraction is printed in\nthe morning paper you can't overlook it without incurring the suspicion\nof being illiterate and virtueless. That's Lichfield.\"\n\n\"But, Polly--\"\n\n\"Sophist, don't I know my Lichfield? I know it almost as well as I know\nRudolph Musgrave. And so I prophesy that he will not marry Clarice\nPendomer, because he is inevitably tired of her by this. He will marry\nmoney, just as all the Musgraves do. Moreover, I prophesy that we will\ngabble about this mess until we find a newer target for our stone\nthrowing, and be just as friendly with the participants to their faces\nas we ever were. So don't let me hear any idiotic talk about whether or\nno _I_ am going to receive her--\"\n\n\"Well, after all, she was born a Bellingham. We must remember that.\"\n\n\"Wasn't I saying I knew my Lichfield?\" Mrs. Ashmeade placidly observed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd time, indeed, attested her to be right in every particular.\n\nYet it must be recorded that at this critical juncture chance rather\nremarkably favored Colonel Musgrave and Mrs. Pendomer, by giving\nLichfield something of greater interest to talk about; since now, just\nin the nick of occasion, occurred the notorious Scott Musgrave murder.\nScott Musgrave--a fourth cousin once removed of the colonel's, to be\nquite accurate--had in the preceding year seduced the daughter of a\nvillage doctor, a negligible \"half-strainer\" up country at Warren; and\nher two brothers, being irritated, picked this particular season to\nwaylay him in the street, as he reeled homeward one night from the\nCommodores' Club, and forthwith to abolish Scott Musgrave after the\nprimitive methods of their lower station in society.\n\nThese details, indeed, were never officially made public, since a\ndiscreet police force \"found no clues\"; for Fred Musgrave (of King's\nGarden), as befitted the dead man's well-to-do brother, had been at no\nlittle pains to insure constabulary shortsightedness, in preference to\nhaving the nature of Scott Musgrave's recreations unsympathetically\naired. Fred Musgrave thereby afforded Lichfield a delectable opportunity\n(conversationally and abetted by innumerable \"they _do_ say's\") to\naccredit the murder, turn by turn, to every able-bodied person residing\nwithin stone's throw of its commission. So that few had time, now, to\ntalk of Rudolph Musgrave and Clarice Pendomer; for it was not in\nLichfieldian human nature to discuss a mere domestic imbroglio when\nhere, also in the Musgrave family, was a picturesque and gory\nassassination to lay tongue to.\n\nSo Colonel Musgrave was duly re\u00eblected that spring to the librarianship\nof the Lichfield Historical Association, and the name of Mrs. George\nPendomer was not stricken from the list of patronesses of the Lichfield\nGerman Club, but was merely altered to \"Mrs. Clarice Pendomer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the bottom of his heart Colonel Musgrave was a trifle irritated that\nhis self-sacrifice should be thus unrewarded by martyrdom. Circumstances\nhad enabled him to assume, and he had gladly accepted, the blame for\nJohn Charteris's iniquity, rather than let Anne Charteris know the truth\nabout her husband and Clarice Pendomer. The truth would have killed\nAnne, the colonel believed; and besides, the colonel had enjoyed the\nperformance of a picturesque action.\n\nAnd having acted as a hero in permitting himself to be pilloried as a\nlibertine, it was preferable of course not to have incurred ostracism\nthereby. His common-sense conceded this; and yet, to Colonel Musgrave,\nit could not but be evident that Destiny was hardly rising to the\npossibilities of the situation.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nConcerning Colonel Musgrave one finds the ensuing account in a\npublication of the period devoted to biographies of more or less\nprominent Americans. It is reproduced unchanged, because these memoirs\nwere--in the old days--compiled by the person whom they commemorated.\nThe custom was a worthy one, since the value of an autobiography is\ndetermined by the nature of its superfluities and falsehoods.\n\n\"MUSGRAVE, RUDOLPH VARTREY, editor; _b_.

Handsome\nand trim and affable, he defied chronology by looking ten years younger\nthan he was known to be. For at least a decade he had been invaluable to\nLichfield matrons alike against the entertainment of an \"out-of-town\ngirl,\" the management of a cotillion and the prevention of unpleasant\npauses among incongruous dinner companies.\n\nIn short, he was by all accounts the social triumph of his generation;\nand his military title, won by four years of arduous service at\nreceptions and parades while on the staff of a former Governor of the\nState, this seasoned bachelor carried off with plausibility and\ndistinction.\n\nThe story finds him \"Librarian and Corresponding Secretary\" of the\nLichfield Historical Association, which office he had held for some six\nyears. The salary was small, and the colonel had inherited little; but\nhis sister, Miss Agatha Musgrave, who lived with him, was a notable\nhousekeeper. He increased his resources in a gentlemanly fashion by\ngenealogical research, directed mostly toward the rehabilitation of\nambiguous pedigrees; and for the rest, no other man could have fulfilled\nmore gracefully the main duty of the Librarian, which was to exhibit the\nAssociation's collection of relics to hurried tourists \"doing\"\nLichfield.\n\nHis \"Library manner\" was modeled upon that which an eighteenth century\nportrait would conceivably possess, should witchcraft set the canvas\nbreathing.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nAlso the story finds Colonel Musgrave in the company of his sister on a\nwarm April day, whilst these two sat upon the porch of the Musgrave home\nin Lichfield, and Colonel Musgrave waited until it should be time to\nopen the Library for the afternoon. And about them birds twittered\ncheerily, and the formal garden flourished as gardens thrive nowhere\nexcept in Lichfield, and overhead the sky was a turkis-blue, save for a\nfew irrelevant clouds which dappled it here and there like splashes of\nwhipped cream.\n\nYet, for all this, the colonel was ill-at-ease; and care was on his\nbrow, and venom in his speech.\n\n\"And one thing,\" Colonel Musgrave concluded, with decision, \"I wish\ndistinctly understood, and that is, if she insists on having young men\nloafing about her--as, of course, she will--she will have to entertain\nthem in the garden. I won't have them in the house, Agatha. You remember\nthat Langham girl you had here last Easter?\" he added, disconsolately\n--\"the one who positively littered up the house with young men,\nand sang idiotic jingles to them at all hours of the night about\nthe Bailey family and the correct way to spell chicken? She drove me to\nthe verge of insanity, and I haven't a doubt that this Patricia person\nwill be quite as obstreperous. So, please mention it to her,\nAgatha--casually, of course--that, in Lichfield, when one is partial to\neither vocal exercise or amorous daliance, the proper scene of action is\nthe garden. I really cannot be annoyed by her.\"\n\n\"But, Rudolph,\" his sister protested, \"you forget she is engaged to the\nEarl of Pevensey. An engaged girl naturally wouldn't care about meeting\nany young men.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said the colonel, drily.\n\nEnsued a pause, during which the colonel lighted yet another cigarette.\n\nThen, \"I have frequently observed,\" he spoke, in absent wise, \"that all\nyoung women having that peculiarly vacuous expression about the eyes--I\nbelieve there are misguided persons who describe such eyes as being\n'dreamy,'--are invariably possessed of a fickle, unstable and coquettish\ntemperament. Oh, no! You may depend upon it, Agatha, the fact that she\ncontemplates purchasing the right to support a peculiarly disreputable\nmember of the British peerage will not hinder her in the least from\nmaking advances to all the young men in the neighborhood.\"\n\nMiss Musgrave was somewhat ruffled. She was a homely little woman with\nnothing of the ordinary Musgrave comeliness. Candor even compels the\nstatement that in her pudgy swarthy face there was a droll suggestion\nof the pug-dog.\n\n\"I am sure,\" Miss Musgrave remonstrated, with placid dignity, \"that you\nknow nothing whatever about her, and that the reports about the earl\nhave probably been greatly exaggerated, and that her picture shows her\nto be an unusually attractive girl. Though it is true,\" Miss Musgrave\nconceded after reflection, \"that there are any number of persons in the\nHouse of Lords that I wouldn't in the least care to have in my own\nhouse, even with the front parlor all in linen as it unfortunately is.\nSo awkward when you have company! And the Bible does bid us not to put\nour trust in princes, and, for my part, I never thought that photographs\ncould be trusted, either.\"\n\n\"Scorn not the nobly born, Agatha,\" her brother admonished her, \"nor\ntreat with lofty scorn the well-connected. The very best people are\nsometimes respectable. And yet,\" he pursued, with a slight hiatus of\nthought, \"I should not describe her as precisely an attractive-looking\ngirl. She seems to have a lot of hair,--if it is all her own, which it\nprobably isn't,--and her nose is apparently straight enough, and I\ngather she is not absolutely deformed anywhere; but that is all I can\nconscientiously say in her favor. She is artificial. Her hair, now! It\nhas a--well, you would not call it exactly a crinkle or precisely a\nwave, but rather somewhere between the two. Yes, I think I should\ndescribe it as a ripple. I fancy it must be rather like the reflection\nof a sunset in--a duck-pond, say, with a faint wind ruffling the water.\nFor I gather that her hair is of some light shade,--induced, I haven't a\ndoubt, by the liberal use of peroxides. And this ripple, too, Agatha, it\nstands to reason, must be the result of coercing nature, for I have\nnever seen it in any other woman's hair. Moreover,\" Colonel Musgrave\ncontinued, warming somewhat to his subject, \"there is a dimple--on the\nright side of her mouth, immediately above it,--which speaks of the most\nfrivolous tendencies. I dare say it comes and goes when she\ntalks,--winks at you, so to speak, in a manner that must be simply\nidiotic. That foolish little cleft in her chin, too--\"\n\nBut at this point, his sister interrupted him.\n\n\"I hadn't a notion,\" said she, \"that you had even looked at the\nphotograph. And you seem to have it quite by heart, Rudolph,--and some\npeople admire dimples, you know, and, at any rate, her mother had red\nhair, so Patricia isn't really responsible. I decided that it would be\nfoolish to use the best mats to-night. We can save them for Sunday\nsupper, because I am only going to have eggs and a little cold meat, and\nnot make company of her.\"\n\nFor no apparent reason, Rudolph Musgrave flushed.\n\n\"I inspected it--quite casually--last night. Please don't be absurd,\nAgatha! If we were threatened with any other direful visitation\n--influenza, say, or the seventeen-year locust,--I should\nnaturally read up on the subject in order to know what to expect. And\nsince Providence has seen fit to send us a visitor rather than a\nvisitation--though, personally, I should infinitely prefer the\ninfluenza, as interfering in less degree with my comfort,--I have, of\ncourse, neglected no opportunity of finding out what we may reasonably\nlook forward to. I fear the worst, Agatha. For I repeat, the girl's face\nis, to me, absolutely unattractive!\"\n\nThe colonel spoke with emphasis, and flung away his cigarette, and took\nup his hat to go.\n\nAnd then, \"I suppose,\" said Miss Musgrave, absently, \"you will be\nfalling in love with her, just as you did with Anne Charteris and Aline\nVan Orden and all those other minxes. I _would_ like to see you married,\nRudolph, only I couldn't stand your having a wife.\"\n\n\"I! I!\" sputtered the colonel. \"I think you must be out of your head! I\nfall in love with that chit! Good Lord, Agatha, you are positively\nidiotic!\"\n\nAnd the colonel turned on his heel, and walked stiffly through the\ngarden. But, when half-way down the path, he wheeled about and came\nback.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Agatha,\" he said, contritely, \"it was not my\nintention to be discourteous. But somehow--somehow, dear, I don't quite\nsee the necessity for my falling in love with anybody, so long as I have\nyou.\"\n\nAnd Miss Musgrave, you may be sure, forgave him promptly; and\nafterward--with a bit of pride and an infinity of love in her kind,\nhomely face,--her eyes followed him out of the garden on his way to open\nthe Library. And she decided in her heart that she had the dearest and\nbest and handsomest brother in the universe, and that she must remember\nto tell him, accidentally, how becoming his new hat was. And then, at\nsome unspoken thought, she smiled, wistfully.\n\n\"She would be a very lucky girl if he did,\" said Miss Musgrave, apropos\nof nothing in particular; and tossed her grizzly head.\n\n\"An earl, indeed!\" said Miss Musgrave\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAnd this is how it came about:\n\nPatricia Vartrey (a second cousin once removed of Colonel Rudolph\nMusgrave's), as the older inhabitants of Lichfield will volubly attest,\nwas always a person who did peculiar things. The list of her\neccentricities is far too lengthy here to be enumerated; but she began\nit by being born with red hair--Titian reds and auburns were\nundiscovered euphemisms in those days--and, in Lichfield, this is not\nregarded as precisely a lady-like thing to do; and she ended it, as far\nas Lichfield was concerned, by eloping with what Lichfield in its horror\ncould only describe, with conscious inadequacy, as \"a quite unheard-of\nperson.\"\n\nIndisputably the man was well-to-do already; and from this nightmarish\ntopsy-turvidom of Reconstruction the fellow visibly was plucking wealth.\nAlso young Stapylton was well enough to look at, too, as Lichfield\nflurriedly conceded.\n\nBut it was equally undeniable that he had made his money through a\nseries of commercial speculations distinguished both by shiftiness and\ndaring, and that the man himself had been until the War a wholly\nnegligible \"poor white\" person,--an overseer, indeed, for \"Wild Will\"\nMusgrave, Colonel Musgrave's father, who was of course the same\nLieutenant-Colonel William Sebastian Musgrave, C.S.A., that met his\ndeath at Gettysburg.\n\nThis upstart married Patricia Vartrey, for all the chatter and\nwhispering, and carried her away from Lichfield, as yet a little dubious\nas to what recognition, if any, should be accorded the existence of the\nStapyltons. And afterward (from a notoriously untruthful North, indeed)\ncame rumors that he was rapidly becoming wealthy; and of Patricia\nVartrey's death at her daughter's birth; and of the infant's health and\nstrength and beauty, and of her lavish upbringing,--a Frenchwoman,\nLichfield whispered, with absolutely nothing to do but attend upon the\nchild.\n\nAnd then, little by little, a new generation sprang up, and, little by\nlittle, the interest these rumors waked became more lax; and it was\nbrought about, at last, by the insidious transitions of time, that\nPatricia Vartrey was forgotten in Lichfield. Only a few among the older\nmen remembered her; some of them yet treasured, as these fogies so often\ndo, a stray fan or an odd glove; and in bycorners of sundry\ntime-toughened hearts there lurked the memory of a laughing word or of a\nglance or of some such casual bounty, that Patricia Vartrey had accorded\nthese hearts' owners when the world was young.\n\nBut Agatha Musgrave, likewise, remembered the orphan cousin who had\nbeen reared with her. She had loved Patricia Vartrey; and, in due time,\nshe wrote to Patricia's daughter,--in stately, antiquated phrases that\nastonished the recipient not a little,--and the girl had answered. The\ncorrespondence flourished. And it was not long before Miss Musgrave had\ninduced her young cousin to visit Lichfield.\n\nColonel Rudolph Musgrave, be it understood, knew nothing of all this\nuntil the girl was actually on her way. And now, she was to arrive that\nafternoon, to domicile herself in his quiet house for two long\nweeks--this utter stranger, look you!--and upset his comfort, ask him\nsilly questions, expect him to talk to her, and at the end of her visit,\npossibly, present him with some outlandish gimcrack made of cardboard\nand pink ribbons, in which she would expect him to keep his papers. The\nLangham girl did that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is honesty's part to give you the man no better than he was.\nLichfield at large had pampered him; many women had loved him; and above\nall, Miss Agatha had spoiled him. After fifteen years of being the pivot\nabout which the economy of a household revolves, after fifteen years of\nbeing the inevitable person whose approval must be secured before any\ndomestic alteration, however trivial, may be considered, no mortal man\nmay hope to remain a paragon of unselfishness.\n\nColonel Musgrave joyed in the society of women. But he classed\nthem--say, with the croquettes adorned with pink paper frills which were\nthen invariably served at the suppers of the Lichfield German Club,--as\nacceptable enough, upon a conscious holiday, but wholly incongruous with\nthe slippered ease of home. When you had an inclination for feminine\nsociety, you shaved and changed your clothes and thought up an impromptu\nor so against emergency, and went forth to seek it. That was natural;\nbut to have a petticoated young person infesting your house, hourly, was\nas preposterous as ice-cream soda at breakfast.\n\nThe metaphor set him off at a tangent. He wondered if this Patricia\nperson could not (tactfully) be induced to take her bath after\nbreakfast, as Agatha did? after he had his? Why, confound the girl, he\nwas not responsible for there being only one bathroom in the house! It\nwas necessary for him to have his bath and be at the Library by nine\no'clock. This interloper must be made to understand as much.\n\nThe colonel reached the Library undecided as to whether Miss Stapylton\nhad better breakfast in her room, or if it would be entirely proper for\nher to come to the table in one of those fluffy lace-trimmed garments\nsuch as Agatha affected at the day's beginning?\n\nThe question was a nice one. It was not as though servants were willing\nto be bothered with carrying trays to people's rooms; he knew what\nAgatha had to say upon that subject. It was not as though he were the\nchit's first cousin, either. He almost wished himself in the decline of\nlife, and free to treat the girl paternally.\n\nAnd so he fretted all that afternoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, too, he reflected that it would be very awkward if Agatha should\nbe unwell while this Patricia person was in the house. Agatha in her\nnormal state was of course the kindliest and cheeriest gentlewoman in\nthe universe, but any physical illness appeared to transform her nature\ndisastrously. She had her \"attacks,\" she \"felt badly\" very often\nnowadays, poor dear; and how was a Patricia person to be expected to\nmake allowances for the fact that at such times poor Agatha was\nunavoidably a little cross and pessimistic?\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nYet Colonel Musgrave strolled into his garden, later, with a tolerable\naffectation of unconcern. Women, after all, he assured himself, were\nnecessary for the perpetuation of the species; and, resolving for the\nfuture to view these weakly, big-hipped and slope-shouldered makeshifts\nof Nature's with larger tolerance, he cocked his hat at a\ndevil-may-carish angle, and strode up the walk, whistling jauntily and\nhaving, it must be confessed, to the unprejudiced observer very much the\nair of a sheep in wolf's clothing.\n\n\"At worst,\" he was reflecting, \"I can make love to her. They, as a rule,\ntake kindlily enough to that; and in the exercise of hospitality a host\nmust go to all lengths to divert his guests. Failure is not\npermitted....\"\n\nThen She came to him.\n\nShe came to him across the trim, cool lawn, leisurely, yet with a\nresilient tread that attested the vigor of her slim young body. She was\nall in white, diaphanous, ethereal, quite incredibly incredible; but as\nshe passed through the long shadows of the garden--fire-new, from the\nheart of the sunset, Rudolph Musgrave would have sworn to you,--the lacy\nfolds and furbelows and semi-transparencies that clothed her were now\ntinged with gold, and now, as a hedge or flower-bed screened her from\nthe horizontal rays, were softened into multitudinous graduations of\ngrays and mauves and violets.\n\n\"Failure is not permitted,\" he was repeating in his soul....\n\n\"You're Cousin Rudolph, aren't you?\" she asked. \"How perfectly\nentrancing! You see until to-day I always thought that if I had been\noffered the choice between having cousins or appendicitis I would have\npreferred to be operated on.\"\n\nAnd Rudolph Musgrave noted, with a delicious tingling somewhere about\nhis heart, that her hair was really like the reflection of a sunset in\nrippling waters,--only many times more beautiful, of course,--and that\nher mouth was an inconsiderable trifle, a scrap of sanguine curves, and\nthat her eyes were purple glimpses of infinity.\n\nThen he observed that his own mouth was giving utterance to divers\nirrelevant and foolish sounds, which eventually resolved themselves into\nthe statement he was glad to see her. And immediately afterward the\nbanality of this remark brought the hot blood to his face and, for the\nrest of the day, stung him and teased him, somewhere in the background\nof his mind, like an incessant insect.\n\nGlad, indeed!\n\nBefore he had finished shaking hands with Patricia Stapylton, it was\nall over with the poor man.\n\n\"Er--h'm!\" quoth he.\n\n\"Only,\" Miss Stapylton was meditating, with puckered brow, \"it would be\nunseemly for me to call you Rudolph--\"\n\n\"You impertinent minx!\" cried he, in his soul; \"I should rather think it\nwould be!\"\n\n\"--and Cousin Rudolph sounds exactly like a dried-up little man with\neyeglasses and crows' feet and a gentle nature. I rather thought you\nwere going to be like that, and I regard it as extremely hospitable of\nyou not to be. You are more like--like what now?\" Miss Stapylton put her\nhead to one side and considered the contents of her vocabulary,--\"you\nare like a viking. I shall call you Olaf,\" she announced, when she had\nreached a decision.\n\nThis, look you, to the most dignified man in Lichfield,--a person who\nhad never borne a nickname in his life. You must picture for yourself\nhow the colonel stood before her, big, sturdy and blond, and glared down\nat her, and assured himself that he was very indignant; like Timanthes,\nthe colonel's biographer prefers to draw a veil before the countenance\nto which art is unable to do justice.\n\nThen, \"I have no admiration for the Northmen,\" Rudolph Musgrave\ndeclared, stiffly. \"They were a rude and barbarous nation, proverbially\naddicted to piracy and intemperance.\"\n\n\"My goodness gracious!\" Miss Stapylton observed,--and now, for the\nfirst time, he saw the teeth that were like grains of rice upon a pink\nrose petal. Also, he saw dimples. \"And does one mean all that by a\nviking?\"\n\n\"The vikings,\" he informed her--and his Library manner had settled upon\nhim now to the very tips of his fingers--\"were pirates. The word is of\nIcelandic origin, from _vik_, the name applied to the small inlets along\nthe coast in which they concealed their galleys. I may mention that Olaf\nwas not a viking, but a Norwegian king, being the first Christian\nmonarch to reign in Norway.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Miss Stapylton; \"how interesting!\"\n\nThen she yawned with deliberate cruelty.\n\n\"However,\" she concluded, \"I shall call you Olaf, just the same.\"\n\n\"Er--h'm!\" said the colonel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd this stuttering boor (he reflected) was Colonel Rudolph Musgrave,\nconfessedly the social triumph of his generation! This imbecile, without\na syllable to say for himself, without a solitary adroit word within\ntongue's reach, wherewith to annihilate the hussy, was a Musgrave of\nMatocton!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd she did. To her he was \"Olaf\" from that day forth.\n\nRudolph Musgrave called her, \"You.\" He was nettled, of course, by her\nforwardness--\"Olaf,\" indeed!--yet he found it, somehow, difficult to\nbear this fact in mind continuously.\n\nFor while it is true our heroes and heroines in fiction no longer fall\nin love at first sight, Nature, you must remember, is too busily\nemployed with other matters to have much time to profit by current\nliterature. Then, too, she is not especially anxious to be realistic.\nShe prefers to jog along in the old rut, contentedly turning out\nchromolithographic sunrises such as they give away at the tea stores,\ncontentedly staging the most violent and improbable melodramas;\nand--sturdy old Philistine that she is--she even now permits her\nchildren to fall in love in the most primitive fashion.\n\nShe is not particularly interested in subtleties and soul analyses; she\nmerely chuckles rather complacently when a pair of eyes are drawn,\nsomehow, to another pair of eyes, and an indescribable something is\naltered somewhere in some untellable fashion, and the world, suddenly,\nbecomes the most delightful place of residence in all the universe.\nIndeed, it is her favorite miracle, this. For at work of this sort the\nold Philistine knows that she is an adept; and she has rejoiced in the\nskill of her hands, with a sober workmanly joy, since Cain first went\na-wooing in the Land of Nod.\n\nSo Colonel Rudolph Musgrave, without understanding what had happened to\nhim, on a sudden was strangely content with life.\n\nIt was at supper--dinner, in Lichfield, when not a formal\nentertainment, is eaten at two in the afternoon--that he fell\na-speculating as to whether Her eyes, after all, could be fitly\ndescribed as purple.\n\nWasn't there a grayer luminosity about them than he had at first\nsuspected?--wasn't the cool glow of them, in a word, rather that of\nsunlight falling upon a wet slate roof?\n\nIt was a delicate question, an affair of nuances, of almost\nimperceptible graduations; and in debating a matter of such nicety, a\nman must necessarily lay aside all petty irritation, such as being\nnettled by an irrational nickname, and approach the question with\nunbiased mind.\n\nHe did. And when, at last, he had come warily to the verge of decision,\nMiss Musgrave in all innocence announced that they would excuse him if\nhe wished to get back to his work.\n\nHe discovered that, somehow, the three had finished supper; and,\nsomehow, he presently discovered himself in his study, where eight\no'clock had found him every evening for the last ten years, when he was\nnot about his social diversions. An old custom, you will observe, is not\nlightly broken.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nSubsequently: \"I have never approved of these international marriages,\"\nsaid Colonel Musgrave, with heat. \"It stands to reason, she is simply\nmarrying the fellow for his title. _(The will of Jeremiah Brown, dated\n29 November, 1690, recorded 2 February, 1690-1, mentions his wife Eliza\nBrown and appoints her his executrix.)_ She can't possibly care for him.\n_(This, then, was the second wife of Edward Osborne of Henrico, who,\nmarrying him 15 June, 1694, died before January, 1696-7.)_ But they are\nall flibbertigibbets, every one of them. _(She had apparently no\nchildren by either marriage--)_ And I dare say she is no better than the\nrest.\"\n\nCame a tap on the door. Followed a vision of soft white folds and\nfurbelows and semi-transparencies and purple eyes and a pouting mouth.\n\n\"I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, Olaf,\" the owner of these\nvanities complained. \"Are you very busy? Cousin Agatha is about her\nhousekeeping, and I have read the afternoon paper all through,--even the\nlist of undelivered letters and the woman's page,--and I just want to\nsee the Gilbert Stuart picture,\" she concluded,--exercising, one is\nafraid, a certain economy in regard to the truth.\n\nThis was a little too much. If a man's working-hours are not to be\nrespected--if his privacy is to be thus invaded on the flimsiest of\npretexts,--why, then, one may very reasonably look for chaos to come\nagain. This, Rudolph Musgrave decided, was a case demanding firm and\ninstant action. Here was a young person who needed taking down a peg or\ntwo, and that at once.\n\nBut he made the mistake of looking at her first. And after that, he lied\nglibly. \"Good Lord, no! I am not in the least busy now. In fact, I was\njust about to look you two up.\"\n\n\"I was rather afraid of disturbing you.\" She hesitated; and a lucent\nmischief woke in her eyes. \"You are so patriarchal, Olaf,\" she lamented.\n\"I felt like a lion venturing into a den of Daniels. But if you cross\nyour heart you aren't really busy--why, then, you can show me the\nStuart, Olaf.\"\n\nIt is widely conceded that Gilbert Stuart never in his after work\nsurpassed the painting which hung then in Rudolph Musgrave's study,--the\nportrait of the young Gerald Musgrave, afterward the friend of Jefferson\nand Henry, and, still later, the author of divers bulky tomes,\npertaining for the most part to ethnology. The boy smiles at you from\nthe canvas, smiles ambiguously,--smiles with a woman's mouth, set above\na resolute chin, however,--and with a sort of humorous sadness in his\neyes. These latter are of a dark shade of blue--purple, if you\nwill,--and his hair is tinged with red.\n\n\"Why, he took after me!\" said Miss Stapylton. \"How thoughtful of him,\nOlaf!\"\n\nAnd Rudolph Musgrave saw the undeniable resemblance. It gave him a queer\nsort of shock, too, as he comprehended, for the first time, that the\nfaint blue vein on that lifted arm held Musgrave blood,--the same blood\nwhich at this thought quickened. For any person guided by appearances,\nRudolph Musgrave considered, would have surmised that the vein in\nquestion contained celestial ichor or some yet diviner fluid.\n\n\"It is true,\" he conceded, \"that there is a certain likeness.\"\n\n\"And he is a very beautiful boy,\" said Miss Stapylton, demurely. \"Thank\nyou, Olaf; I begin to think you are a dangerous flatterer. But he is\nonly a boy, Olaf! And I had always thought of Gerald Musgrave as a\nlearned person with a fringe of whiskers all around his face--like a\ncenterpiece, you know.\"\n\nThe colonel smiled. \"This portrait was painted early in life. Our\nkinsman was at that time, I believe, a person of rather frivolous\ntendencies. Yet he was not quite thirty when he first established his\nreputation by his monograph upon _The Evolution of Marriage_. And\nafterwards, just prior to his first meeting with Goethe, you will\nremember--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Miss Stapylton assented, hastily; \"I remember perfectly. I\nknow all about him, thank you. And it was that beautiful boy, Olaf, that\nyoung-eyed cherub, who developed into a musty old man who wrote musty\nold books, and lived a musty, dusty life all by himself, and never\nmarried or had any fun at all! How _horrid_, Olaf!\" she cried, with a\nqueer shrug of distaste.\n\n\"I fail,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"to perceive anything--ah--horrid in a\nlife devoted to the study of anthropology. His reputation when he died\nwas international.\"\n\n\"But he never had any fun, you jay-bird! And, oh, Olaf! Olaf! that boy\ncould have had so much fun! The world held so much for him! Why, Fortune\nis only a woman, you know, and what woman could have refused him\nanything if he had smiled at her like that when he asked for it?\"\n\nMiss Stapylton gazed up at the portrait for a long time now, her hands\nclasped under her chin. Her face was gently reproachful.\n\n\"Oh, boy dear, boy dear!\" she said, with a forlorn little quaver in her\nvoice, \"how _could_ you be _so_ foolish? _Didn't_ you know there was\nsomething better in the world than grubbing after musty old tribes and\ncustoms and folk-songs? Oh, precious child, how could you?\"\n\nGerald Musgrave smiled back at her, ambiguously; and Rudolph Musgrave\nlaughed. \"I perceive,\" said he, \"you are a follower of Epicurus. For my\npart, I must have fetched my ideals from the tub of the Stoic. I can\nconceive of no nobler life than one devoted to furthering the cause of\nscience.\"\n\nShe looked up at him, with a wan smile. \"A barren life!\" she said: \"ah,\nyes, his was a wasted life! His books are all out-of-date now, and\nnobody reads them, and it is just as if he had never been. A barren\nlife, Olaf! And that beautiful boy might have had so much fun--Life is\nqueer, isn't it, Olaf?\"\n\nAgain he laughed, \"The criticism,\" he suggested, \"is not altogether\noriginal. And Science, no less than War, must have her unsung heroes.\nYou must remember,\" he continued, more seriously, \"that any great work\nmust have as its foundation the achievements of unknown men. I fancy\nthat Cheops did not lay every brick in his pyramid with his own hand;\nand I dare say Nebuchadnezzar employed a few helpers when he was laying\nout his hanging gardens. But time cannot chronicle these lesser men.\nTheir sole reward must be the knowledge that they have aided somewhat in\nthe unending work of the world.\"\n\nHer face had altered into a pink and white penitence which was flavored\nwith awe.\n\n\"I--I forgot,\" she murmured, contritely; \"I--forgot you were--like\nhim--about your genealogies, you know. Oh, Olaf, I'm very silly! Of\ncourse, it is tremendously fine and--and nice, I dare say, if you like\nit,--to devote your life to learning, as you and he have done. I forgot,\nOlaf. Still, I am sorry, somehow, for that beautiful boy,\" she ended,\nwith a disconsolate glance at the portrait.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nLong after Miss Stapylton had left him, the colonel sat alone in his\nstudy, idle now, and musing vaguely. There were no more addenda\nconcerning the descendants of Captain Thomas Osborne that night.\n\nAt last, the colonel rose and threw open a window, and stood looking\ninto the moonlit garden. The world bathed in a mist of blue and silver.\nThere was a breeze that brought him sweet, warm odors from the garden,\ntogether with a blurred shrilling of crickets and the conspiratorial\nconference of young leaves.\n\n\"Of course, it is tremendously fine and--and nice, if you like it,\" he\nsaid, with a faint chuckle. \"I wonder, now, if I do like it?\"\n\nHe was strangely moved. He seemed, somehow, to survey Rudolph Musgrave\nand all his doings with complete and unconcerned aloofness. The man's\nlife, seen in its true proportions, dwindled into the merest flicker of\na match; he had such a little while to live, this Rudolph Musgrave! And\nhe spent the serious hours of this brief time writing notes and charts\nand pamphlets that perhaps some hundred men in all the universe might\ncare to read--pamphlets no better and no more accurate than hundreds of\nother men were writing at that very moment.\n\nNo, the capacity for originative and enduring work was not in him; and\nthis incessant compilation of dreary footnotes, this incessant rummaging\namong the bones of the dead--did it, after all, mean more to this\nRudolph Musgrave than one full, vivid hour of life in that militant\nworld yonder, where men fought for other and more tangible prizes than\nthe mention of one's name in a genealogical journal?\n\nHe could not have told you. In his heart, he knew that a thorough digest\nof the Wills and Orders of the Orphans' Court of any county must always\nrank as a useful and creditable performance; but, from without, the\nsounds and odors of Spring were calling to him, luring him, wringing his\nvery heart, bidding him come forth into the open and crack a jest or two\nbefore he died, and stare at the girls a little before the match had\nflickered out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this time he heard a moaning noise. The colonel gave a shrug, sighed,\nand ascended to his sister's bedroom. He knew that Agatha must be ill;\nand that there is no more efficient quietus to wildish meditations than\nthe heating of hot-water bottles and the administration of hypnotics he\nhad long ago discovered.\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO - RENASCENCE\n\n  \"As one imprisoned that hath lain alone\n  And dreamed of sunlight where no vagrant gleam\n  Of sunlight pierces, being freed, must deem\n  This too but dreaming, and must dread the sun\n  Whose glory dazzles,--even as such-an-one\n  Am I whose longing was but now supreme\n  For this high hour, and, now it strikes, esteem\n  I do but dream long dreamed-of goals are won.\n\n  \"Phyllis, I am not worthy of thy love.\n  I pray thee let no kindly word be said\n  Of me at all, for in the train thereof,\n  Whenas yet-parted lips, sigh-visited,\n  End speech and wait, mine when I will to move,\n  Such joy awakens that I grow afraid.\"\nTHOMAS ROWLAND. _Triumphs of Phyllis_.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThey passed with incredible celerity, those next ten days--those\nstrange, delicious, topsy-turvy days. To Rudolph Musgrave it seemed\nafterward that he had dreamed them away in some vague Lotus Land--in a\ndelectable country where, he remembered, there were always purple eyes\nthat mocked you, and red lips that coaxed you now, and now cast gibes at\nyou.\n\nYou felt, for the most part of your stay in this country, flushed and\nhot and uncomfortable and unbelievably awkward, and you were mercilessly\nbedeviled there; but not for all the accumulated wealth of Samarkand and\nInd and Ophir would you have had it otherwise. Ah, no, not otherwise in\nthe least trifle. For now uplifted to a rosy zone of acquiescence, you\npartook incuriously at table of nectar and ambrosia, and noted abroad,\nwithout any surprise, that you trod upon a more verdant grass than\nusual, and that someone had polished up the sun a bit; and, in fine, you\nsnatched a fearful joy from the performance of the most trivial\nfunctions of life.\n\nYet always he remembered that it could not last; always he remembered\nthat in the autumn Patricia was to marry Lord Pevensey. She sometimes\ngave him letters to mail which were addressed to that nobleman. He\nwondered savagely what was in them; he posted them with a vicious shove;\nand, for the time, they caused him acute twinges of misery. But not for\nlong; no, for, in sober earnest, if some fantastic sequence of events\nhad made his one chance of winning Patricia Stapylton dependent on his\nspending a miserable half-hour in her company, Rudolph Musgrave could\nnot have done it.\n\nAs for Miss Stapylton, she appeared to delight in the cloistered,\neasy-going life of Lichfield. The quaint and beautiful old town fell\nshort in nothing of her expectations, in spite of the fact that she had\npreviously read John Charteris's tales of Lichfield,--\"those effusions\nwhich\" (if the _Lichfield Courier-Herald_ is to be trusted) \"have\nbuilded, by the strength and witchery of record and rhyme, romance and\npoem, a myriad-windowed temple in Lichfield's honor--exquisite,\nluminous, and enduring--for all the world to see.\"\n\nMiss Stapylton appeared to delight in the cloistered easy-going life of\nLichfield,--that town which was once, as the outside world has\nhalf-forgotten now, the center of America's wealth, politics and\nculture, the town to which Europeans compiling \"impressions\" of America\ndevoted one of their longest chapters in the heyday of Elijah Pogram and\nJefferson Brick. But the War between the States has changed all that,\nand Lichfield endures to-day only as a pleasant backwater.\n\nVery pleasant, too, it was in the days of Patricia's advent. There were\nstrikingly few young men about, to be sure; most of them on reaching\nmaturity had settled in more bustling regions. But many maidens remained\nwhom memory delights to catalogue,--tall, brilliant Lizzie Allardyce,\nthe lovely and cattish Marian Winwood, to whom Felix Kennaston wrote\nthose wonderful love-letters which she published when he married\nKathleen Saumarez, the rich Baugh heiresses from Georgia, the Pride\ntwins, and Mattie Ferneyhaugh, whom even rival beauties loved, they say,\nand other damsels by the score,--all in due time to be wooed and won,\nand then to pass out of the old town's life.\n\nAmong the men of Rudolph Musgrave's generation--those gallant oldsters\nwho were born and bred, and meant to die, in Lichfield,--Patricia did\nnot lack for admirers. Tom May was one of them, of course; rarely a\npretty face escaped the tribute of at least one proposal from Tom May.\nThen there was Roderick Taunton, he with the leonine mane, who spared\nher none of his forensic eloquence, but found Patricia less tractable\nthan the most stubborn of juries. Bluff Walter Thurman, too, who was\nsaid to know more of Dickens, whist and criminal law than any other man\nliving, came to worship at her shrine, as likewise did huge red-faced\nAshby Bland, famed for that cavalry charge which history-books tell you\nthat he led, and at which he actually was not present, for reasons all\nLichfield knew and chuckled over. And Courtney Thorpe and Charles\nMaupin, doctors of the flesh and the spirit severally, were others among\nthe rivals who gathered about Patricia at decorous festivals when,\ncandles lighted, the butler and his underlings came with trays of\ndelectable things to eat, and the \"nests\" of tables were set out, and\npleasant chatter abounded.\n\nAnd among Patricia's attendants Colonel Musgrave, it is needless to\nrelate, was pre\u00ebminently pertinacious. The two found a deal to talk\nabout, somehow, though it is doubtful if many of their comments were of\nsufficient importance or novelty to merit record. Then, also, he often\nread aloud to her from lovely books, for the colonel read admirably and\ndid not scruple to give emotional passages their value. _Trilby_,\npublished the preceding spring in book form, was one of these books, for\nall this was at a very remote period; and the _Rubaiyat_ was another,\nfor that poem was as yet unhackneyed and hardly wellknown enough to be\nparodied in those happy days.\n\nOnce he read to her that wonderful sad tale of Hans Christian Andersen's\nwhich treats of the china chimney-sweep and the shepherdess, who eloped\nfrom their bedizened tiny parlor-table, and were frightened by the\nvastness of the world outside, and crept ignominiously back to their fit\nhome. \"And so,\" the colonel ended, \"the little china people remained\ntogether, and were thankful for the rivet in grandfather's neck, and\ncontinued to love each other until they were broken to pieces.\"\n\n\"It was really a very lucky thing,\" Patricia estimated, \"that the\ngrandfather had a rivet in his neck and couldn't nod to the\nbilly-goat-legged person to take the shepherdess away into his cupboard.\nI don't doubt the little china people were glad of it. But after\nclimbing so far--and seeing the stars,--I think they ought to have had\nmore to be glad for.\" Her voice was quaintly wistful.\n\n\"I will let you into a secret--er--Patricia. That rivet was made out of\nthe strongest material in the whole universe. And the old grandfather\nwas glad, at bottom, he had it in his neck so that he couldn't nod and\nseparate the shepherdess from the chimney-sweep.\"\n\n\"Yes,--I guess he had been rather a rip among the bric-\u00e0-brac in his day\nand sympathized with them?\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't just that. You see these little china people had forsaken\ntheir orderly comfortable world on the parlor table to climb very high.\nIt was a brave thing to do, even though they faltered and came back\nafter a while. It is what we all want to do, Patricia--to climb toward\nthe stars,--even those of us who are too lazy or too cowardly to attempt\nit. And when others try it, we are envious and a little uncomfortable,\nand we probably scoff; but we can't help admiring, and there is a rivet\nin the neck of all of us which prevents us from interfering. Oh, yes,\nwe little china people have a variety of rivets, thank God, to prevent\ntoo frequent nodding and too cowardly a compromise with\nbaseness,--rivets that are a part of us and force us into flashes of\nupright living, almost in spite of ourselves, when duty and inclination\ngrapple. There is always the thing one cannot do for the reason that one\nis constituted as one is. That, I take it, is the real rivet in\ngrandfather's neck and everybody else's.\"\n\nHe spoke disjointedly, vaguely, but the girl nodded. \"I think I\nunderstand, Olaf. Only, it is a two-edged rivet--to mix metaphors--and\nkeeps us stiffnecked against all sorts of calls. No, I am not sure that\nthe thing one cannot do because one is what one is, proves to be always\na cause for international jubilations and fireworks on the lawn.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThus Lichfield, as to its staid trousered citizenry, fell prostrate at\nMiss Stapylton's feet, and as to the remainder of its adults,\nvociferously failed to see anything in the least remarkable in her\nappearance, and avidly took and compared notes as to her personal\napparel.\n\n\"You have brought Asmodeus into Lichfield,\" Colonel Musgrave one day\nrebuked Miss Stapylton, as they sat in the garden. \"The demon of pride\nand dress is rampant everywhere--er--Patricia. Even Agatha does her hair\ndifferently now; and in church last Sunday I counted no less than seven\nduplicates of that blue hat of yours.\"\n\nMiss Stapylton was moved to mirth. \"Fancy your noticing a thing like\nthat!\" said she. \"I didn't know you were even aware I had a blue hat.\"\n\n\"I am no judge,\" he conceded, gravely, \"of such fripperies. I don't\npretend to be. But, on the other hand, I must plead guilty to deriving\nconsiderable harmless amusement from your efforts to dress as an example\nand an irritant to all Lichfield.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have me a dowd, Olaf?\" said she, demurely. \"I have to be\nneat and tidy, you know. You wouldn't have me going about in a\ncontinuous state of unbuttonedness and black bombazine like Mrs. Rabbet,\nwould you?\"\n\nRudolph Musgrave debated as to this. \"I dare say,\" he at last conceded,\ncautiously, \"that to the casual eye your appearance is somewhat\n--er--more pleasing than that of our rector's wife. But, on the\nother hand----\"\n\n\"Olaf, I am embarrassed by such fulsome eulogy. Mrs. Rabbet isn't a day\nunder forty-nine. And you consider me _somewhat_ better-looking than she\nis!\"\n\nHe inspected her critically, and was confirmed in his opinion.\n\n\"Olaf\"--coaxingly--\"do you really think I am as ugly as that?\"\n\n\"Pouf!\" said the colonel airily; \"I dare say you are well enough.\"\n\n\"Olaf\"--and this was even more cajoling--\"do you know you've never told\nme what sort of a woman you most admire?\"\n\n\"I don't admire any of them,\" said Colonel Musgrave, stoutly. \"They are\ntoo vain and frivolous--especially the pink-and-white ones,\" he added,\nunkindlily.\n\n\"Cousin Agatha has told me all about your multifarious affairs of\ncourse. She depicts you as a sort of cardiacal buccaneer and visibly\ngloats over the tale of your enormities. She is perfectly dear about\nit. But have you never--_cared_--for any woman, Olaf?\"\n\nPrecarious ground, this! His eyes were fixed upon her now. And hers, for\ndoubtless sufficient reasons, were curiously intent upon anything in the\nuniverse rather than Rudolph Musgrave.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, with a little intake of the breath; \"yes, I cared once.\"\n\n\"And--she cared?\" asked Miss Stapylton.\n\nShe happened, even now, not to be looking at him.\n\n\"She!\" Rudolph Musgrave cried, in real surprise. \"Why, God bless my\nsoul, of course she didn't! She didn't know anything about it.\"\n\n\"You never told her, Olaf?\"--and this was reproachful. Then Patricia\nsaid: \"Well! and did she go down in the cellar and get the wood-ax or\nwas she satisfied just to throw the bric-\u00e0-brac at you?\"\n\nAnd Colonel Musgrave laughed aloud.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he; \"it would have been a brave jest if I had told her,\nwouldn't it? She was young, you see, and wealthy, and--ah, well, I won't\ndeceive you by exaggerating her personal attractions! I will serve up to\nyou no praises of her sauced with lies. And I scorn to fall back on the\nstock-in-trade of the poets,--all their silly metaphors and similes and\nsuchlike nonsense. I won't tell you that her complexion reminded me of\nroses swimming in milk, for it did nothing of the sort. Nor am I going\nto insist that her eyes had a fire like that of stars, or proclaim that\nCupid was in the habit of lighting his torch from them. I don't think\nhe was. I would like to have caught the brat taking any such liberties\nwith those innocent, humorous, unfathomable eyes of hers! And they\ndidn't remind me of violets, either,\" he pursued, belligerently, \"nor\ndid her mouth look to me in the least like a rosebud, nor did I have the\nslightest difficulty in distinguishing between her hands and lilies. I\nconsider these hyperbolical figures of speech to be idiotic. Ah, no!\"\ncried Colonel Musgrave, warming to his subject--and regarding it, too,\nvery intently; \"ah, no, a face that could be patched together at the\nnearest florist's would not haunt a man's dreams o'nights, as hers does!\nI haven't any need for praises sauced with lies! I spurn hyperbole. I\nscorn exaggeration. I merely state calmly and judicially that she was\nGod's masterpiece,--the most beautiful and adorable and indescribable\ncreature that He ever made.\"\n\nShe smiled at this. \"You should have told her, Olaf,\" said Miss\nStapylton. \"You should have told her that you cared.\"\n\nHe gave a gesture of dissent. \"She had everything,\" he pointed out,\n\"everything the world could afford her. And, doubtless, she would have\nbeen very glad to give it all up for me, wouldn't she?--for me, who\nhaven't youth or wealth or fame or anything? Ah, I dare say she would\nhave been delighted to give up the world she knew and loved,--the world\nthat loved her,--for the privilege of helping me digest old county\nrecords!\"\n\nAnd Rudolph Musgrave laughed again, though not mirthfully.\n\nBut the girl was staring at him, with a vague trouble in her eyes. \"You\nshould have told her, Olaf,\" she repeated.\n\nAnd at this point he noted that the arbutus-flush in her cheeks began to\nwiden slowly, until, at last, it had burned back to the little pink\nears, and had merged into the coppery glory of her hair, and had made\nher, if such a thing were possible--which a minute ago it manifestly was\nnot,--more beautiful and adorable and indescribable than ever before.\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" he scoffed, \"Lichfield would have made a fitting home for\nher. She would have been very happy here, shut off from the world with\nus,--with us, whose forefathers have married and intermarried with one\nanother until the stock is worthless, and impotent for any further\nachievement. For here, you know, we have the best blood in America, and\n--for utilitarian purposes--that means the worst blood. Ah, we may prate\nof our superiority to the rest of the world,--and God knows, we\ndo!--but, at bottom, we are worthless. We are worn out, I tell you! we\nare effete and stunted in brain and will-power, and the very desire of\nlife is gone out of us! We are contented simply to exist in Lichfield.\nAnd she--\"\n\nHe paused, and a new, fierce light came into his eyes. \"She was so\nbeautiful!\" he said, half-angrily, between clenched teeth.\n\n\"You are just like the rest of them, Olaf,\" she lamented, with a hint\nof real sadness. \"You imagine you are in love with a girl because you\nhappen to like the color of her eyes, or because there is a curve about\nher lips that appeals to you. That isn't love, Olaf, as we women\nunderstand it. Ah, no, a girl's love for a man doesn't depend altogether\nupon his fitness to be used as an advertisement for somebody's\nready-made clothing.\"\n\n\"You fancy you know what you are talking about,\" said Rudolph Musgrave,\n\"but you don't. You don't realize, you see, how beautiful she--was.\"\n\nAnd this time, he nearly tripped upon the tense, for her hand was on his\narm, and, in consequence, a series of warm, delicious little shivers was\nrunning about his body in a fashion highly favorable to extreme\nperturbation of mind.\n\n\"You should have told her, Olaf,\" she said, wistfully. \"Oh, Olaf, Olaf,\nwhy didn't you tell her?\"\n\nShe did not know, of course, how she was tempting him; she did not know,\nof course, how her least touch seemed to waken every pulse in his body\nto an aching throb, and set hope and fear a-drumming in his breast.\nObviously, she did not know; and it angered him that she did not.\n\n\"She would have laughed at me,\" he said, with a snarl; \"how she would\nhave laughed!\"\n\n\"She wouldn't have laughed, Olaf.\" And, indeed, she did not look as if\nshe would.\n\n\"But much you know of her!\" said Rudolph Musgrave, morosely. \"She was\njust like the rest of them, I tell you! She knew how to stare a man out\nof countenance with big purple eyes that were like violets with the dew\non them, and keep her paltry pink-and-white baby face all pensive and\nsober, till the poor devil went stark, staring mad, and would have\npawned his very soul to tell her that he loved her! She knew! She did it\non purpose. She would look pensive just to make an ass of you! She--\"\n\nAnd here the colonel set his teeth for a moment, and resolutely drew\nback from the abyss.\n\n\"She would not have cared for me,\" he said, with a shrug. \"I was not\nexactly the sort of fool she cared for. What she really cared for was a\nyoung fool who could dance with her in this silly new-fangled gliding\nstyle, and send her flowers and sweet-meats, and make love to her\nglibly--and a petticoated fool who would envy her fine feathers,--and,\nat last, a knavish fool who would barter his title for her money. She\npreferred fools, you see, but she would never have cared for a\nmiddle-aged penniless fool like me. And so,\" he ended, with a vicious\noutburst of mendacity, \"I never told her, and she married a title and\nlived unhappily in gilded splendor ever afterwards.\"\n\n\"You should have told her, Olaf,\" Miss Stapylton persisted; and then she\nasked, in a voice that came very near being inaudible: \"Is it too late\nto tell her now, Olaf?\"\n\nThe stupid man opened his lips a little, and stood staring at her with\nhungry eyes, wondering if it were really possible that she did not hear\nthe pounding of his heart; and then his teeth clicked, and he gave a\ndespondent gesture.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, wearily, \"it is too late now.\"\n\nThereupon Miss Stapylton tossed her head. \"Oh, very well!\" said she;\n\"only, for my part, I think you acted very foolishly, and I don't see\nthat you have the least right to complain. I quite fail to see how you\ncould have expected her to marry you--or, in fact, how you can expect\nany woman to marry you,--if you won't, at least, go to the trouble of\nasking her to do so!\"\n\nThen Miss Stapylton went into the house, and slammed the door after her.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nNor was that the worst of it. For when Rudolph Musgrave followed her--as\nhe presently did, in a state of considerable amaze,--his sister\ninformed him that Miss Stapylton had retired to her room with an\nunaccountable headache.\n\nAnd there she remained for the rest of the evening. It was an unusually\nlong evening.\n\nYet, somehow, in spite of its notable length--affording, as it did, an\nexcellent opportunity for undisturbed work,--Colonel Musgrave found,\nwith a pricking conscience, that he made astonishingly slight progress\nin an exhaustive monograph upon the fragmentary Orderly Book of an\nobscure captain in a long-forgotten regiment, which if it had not\nactually served in the Revolution, had at least been demonstrably\ngranted money \"for services,\" and so entitled hundreds of aspirants to\nbecome the Sons (or Daughters) of various international disagreements.\n\nNor did he see her at breakfast--nor at dinner.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nA curious little heartache accompanied Colonel Musgrave on his way home\nthat afternoon. He had not seen Patricia Stapylton for twenty-four\nhours, and he was just beginning to comprehend what life would be like\nwithout her. He did not find the prospect exhilarating.\n\nThen, as he came up the orderly graveled walk, he heard, issuing from\nthe little vine-covered summer-house, a loud voice. It was a man's\nvoice, and its tones were angry.\n\n\"No! no!\" the man was saying; \"I'll agree to no such nonsense, I tell\nyou! What do you think I am?\"\n\n\"I think you are a jackass-fool,\" Miss Stapylton said, crisply, \"and a\nfortune-hunter, and a sot, and a travesty, and a whole heap of other\nthings I haven't, as yet had time to look up in the dictionary. And I\nthink--I think you call yourself an English gentleman? Well, all I have\nto say is God pity England if her gentlemen are of your stamp! There\nisn't a costermonger in all Whitechapel who would dare talk to me as\nyou've done! I would like to snatch you bald-headed, I would like to\nkill you--And do you think, now, if you were the very last man left in\nall the _world_ that I would--No, don't you try to answer me, for I\ndon't wish to hear a single word you have to say. Oh, oh! how _dare_\nyou!\"\n\n\"Well, I've had provocation enough,\" the man's voice retorted, sullenly.\n\"Perhaps, I have cut up a bit rough, Patricia, but, then, you've been\ntalkin' like a fool, you know. But what's the odds? Let's kiss and make\nup, old girl.\"\n\n\"Don't touch me!\" she panted; \"ah, don't you _dare!_\"\n\n\"You little devil! you infernal little vixen? You'll jilt me, will you?\"\n\n\"Let me go!\" the girl cried, sharply. Rudolph Musgrave went into the\nsummer-house.\n\nThe man Colonel Musgrave found there was big and loose-jointed, with\ntraces of puffiness about his face. He had wheat-colored hair and\nweakish-looking, pale blue eyes. One of his arms was about Miss\nStapylton, but he released her now, and blinked at Rudolph Musgrave.\n\n\"And who are you, pray?\" he demanded, querulously. \"What do you want,\nanyhow? What do you mean by sneakin' in here and tappin' on a fellow's\nshoulder--like a damn' woodpecker, by Jove! I don't know you.\"\n\nThere was in Colonel Musgrave's voice a curious tremor, when he spoke;\nbut to the eye he was unruffled, even faintly amused.\n\n\"I am the owner of this garden,\" he enunciated, with leisurely\ndistinctness, \"and it is not my custom to permit gentlewomen to be\ninsulted in it. So I am afraid I must ask you to leave it.\"\n\n\"Now, see here,\" the man blustered, weakly, \"we don't want any heroics,\nyou know. See here, you're her cousin, ain't you? By God, I'll leave it\nto you, you know! She's treated me badly, don't you understand. She's a\njilt, you know. She's playin' fast and loose----\"\n\nHe never got any further, for at this point Rudolph Musgrave took him by\nthe coat-collar and half-dragged, half-pushed him through the garden,\nshaking him occasionally with a quiet emphasis. The colonel was angry,\nand it was a matter of utter indifference to him that they were\ntrampling over flower-beds, and leaving havoc in their rear.\n\nBut when they had reached the side-entrance, he paused and opened it,\nand then shoved his companion into an open field, where a number of\ncows, fresh from the evening milking, regarded them with incurious eyes.\nIt was very quiet here, save for the occasional jangle of the cow-bells\nand the far-off fifing of frogs in the marsh below.\n\n\"It would have been impossible, of course,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"for\nme to have offered you any personal violence as long as you were, in a\nmanner, a guest of mine. This field, however, is the property of Judge\nWilloughby, and here I feel at liberty to thrash you.\"\n\nThen he thrashed the man who had annoyed Patricia Stapylton.\n\nThat thrashing was, in its way, a masterpiece. There was a certain\nconscientiousness about it, a certain thoroughness of execution--a\ncertain plodding and painstaking carefulness, in a word, such as is\npossible only to those who have spent years in guiding fat-witted\ntourists among the antiquities of the Lichfield Historical Association.\n\n\"You ought to exercise more,\" Rudolph Musgrave admonished his victim,\nwhen he had ended. \"You are entirely too flabby now, you know. That path\nyonder will take you to the hotel, where, I imagine, you are staying.\nThere is a train leaving Lichfield at six-fifteen, and if I were you, I\nwould be very careful not to miss that train. Good-evening. I am sorry\nto have been compelled to thrash you, but I must admit I have enjoyed it\nexceedingly.\"\n\nThen he went back into the garden.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nIn the shadow of a white lilac-bush, Colonel Musgrave paused with an\nawed face.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said he, aghast at the notion; \"what would Agatha say if\nshe knew I had been fighting like a drunken truck-driver! Or, rather,\nwhat would she refrain from saying! Only, she wouldn't believe it of me.\nAnd, for the matter of that,\" Rudolph Musgrave continued, after a\nmoment's reflection, \"I wouldn't have believed it of myself a week ago.\nI think I am changing, somehow. A week ago I would have fetched in the\npolice and sworn out a warrant; and, if the weather had been as damp as\nit is, I would have waited to put on my rubbers before I would have done\nthat much.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nHe found her still in the summer-house, expectant of him, it seemed, her\nlips parted, her eyes glowing. Rudolph Musgrave, looking down into twin\nvivid depths, for a breathing-space, found time to rejoice that he had\nrefused to liken them to stars. Stars, forsooth!--and, pray, what paltry\nsun, what irresponsible comet, what pallid, clinkered satellite, might\nboast a purple splendor such as this? For all asterial scintillations,\nat best, had but a clap-trap glitter; whereas the glow of Patricia's\neyes was a matter worthy of really serious attention.\n\n\"What have you done with him, Olaf?\" the girl breathed, quickly.\n\n\"I reasoned with him,\" said Colonel Musgrave. \"Oh, I found him quite\namenable to logic. He is leaving Lichfield this evening, I think.\"\n\nThereupon Miss Stapylton began to laugh. \"Yes,\" said she, \"you must have\nremonstrated very feelingly. Your tie's all crooked, Olaf dear, and your\nhair's all rumpled, and there's dust all over your coat. You would\ndisgrace a rag-bag. Oh, I'm glad you reasoned--that way! It wasn't\ndignified, but it was dear of you, Olaf. Pevensey's a beast.\"\n\nHe caught his breath at this. \"Pevensey!\" he stammered; \"the Earl of\nPevensey!--the man you are going to marry!\"\n\n\"Dear me, no!\" Miss Stapylton answered, with utmost unconcern; \"I would\nsooner marry a toad. Why, didn't you know, Olaf? I thought, of course,\nyou knew you had been introducing athletics and better manners among the\npeerage! That sounds like a bill in the House of Commons, doesn't it?\"\nThen Miss Stapylton laughed again, and appeared to be in a state of\nagreeable, though somewhat nervous, elation. \"I wrote to him two days\nago,\" she afterward explained, \"breaking off the engagement. So he came\ndown at once and was very nasty about it.\"\n\n\"You--you have broken your engagement,\" he echoed, dully; and continued,\nwith a certain deficiency of finesse, \"But I thought you wanted to be a\ncountess?\"\n\n\"Oh, you boor, you vulgarian!\" the girl cried, \"Oh, you do put things so\ncrudely, Olaf! You are hopeless.\"\n\nShe shook an admonitory forefinger in his direction, and pouted in the\nmost dangerous fashion.\n\n\"But he always seemed so nice,\" she reflected, with puckered brows,\n\"until to-day, you know. I thought he would be eminently suitable. I\nliked him tremendously until--\" and here, a wonderful, tender change\ncame into her face, a wistful quaver woke in her voice--\"until I found\nthere was some one else I liked better.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Rudolph Musgrave.\n\nSo, that was it--yes, that was it! Her head was bowed now--her glorious,\nproud little head,--and she sat silent, an abashed heap of fluffy frills\nand ruffles, a tiny bundle of vaporous ruchings and filmy tucks and\nsuchlike vanities, in the green dusk of the summer-house.\n\nBut he knew. He had seen her face grave and tender in the twilight, and\nhe knew.\n\nShe loved some man--some lucky devil! Ah, yes, that was it! And he knew\nthe love he had unwittingly spied upon to be august; the shamed\nexultance of her face and her illumined eyes, the crimson banners her\ncheeks had flaunted,--these were to Colonel Musgrave as a piece of\nsacred pageantry; and before it his misery was awed, his envy went\nposting to extinction.\n\nThus the stupid man reflected, and made himself very unhappy over it.\n\nThen, after a little, the girl threw back her head and drew a deep\nbreath, and flashed a tremulous smile at him.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said she; \"there are better things in life than coronets,\naren't there, Olaf?\"\n\nYou should have seen how he caught up the word!\n\n\"Life!\" he cried, with a bitter thrill of speech; \"ah, what do I know of\nlife? I am only a recluse, a dreamer, a visionary! You must learn of\nlife from the men who have lived, Patricia. I haven't ever lived. I\nhave always chosen the coward's part. I have chosen to shut myself off\nfrom the world, to posture in a village all my days, and to consider its\ntrifles as of supreme importance. I have affected to scorn that brave\nworld yonder where a man is proven. And, all the while, I was afraid of\nit, I think. I was afraid of you before you came.\"\n\nAt the thought of this Rudolph Musgrave laughed as he fell to pacing up\nand down before her.\n\n\"Life!\" he cried, again, with a helpless gesture; and then smiled at\nher, very sadly. \"'Didn't I know there was something better in life than\ngrubbing after musty tribes and customs and folk-songs?'\" he quoted.\n\"Why, what a question to ask of a professional genealogist! Don't you\nrealize, Patricia, that the very bread I eat is, actually, earned by the\nachievements of people who have been dead for centuries? and in part, of\ncourse, by tickling the vanity of living snobs? That constitutes a nice\ntrade for an able-bodied person as long as men are paid for emptying\ngarbage-barrels--now, doesn't it? And yet it is not altogether for the\npay's sake I do it,\" he added, haltingly. \"There really is a fascination\nabout the work. You are really working out a puzzle,--like a fellow\nsolving a chess-problem. It isn't really work, it is amusement. And when\nyou are establishing a royal descent, and tracing back to czars and\nPlantagenets and Merovingians, and making it all seem perfectly\nplausible, the thing is sheer impudent, flagrant art, and _you_ are the\nartist--\" He broke off here and shrugged. \"No, I could hardly make you\nunderstand. It doesn't matter. It is enough that I have bartered youth\nand happiness and the very power of living for the privilege of grubbing\nin old county records.\"\n\nHe paused. It is debatable if he had spoken wisely, or had spoken even\nin consonance with fact, but his outburst had, at least, the saving\ngrace of sincerity. He was pallid now, shaking in every limb, and in his\nheart was a dull aching. She seemed so incredibly soft and little and\nchildlike, as she looked up at him with troubled eyes.\n\n\"I--I don't quite understand,\" she murmured. \"It isn't as if you were an\nold man, Olaf. It isn't as if--\"\n\nBut he had scarcely heard her. \"Ah, child, child!\" he cried, \"why did\nyou come to waken me? I was content in my smug vanities. I was content\nin my ignorance. I could have gone on contentedly grubbing through my\nmusty, sleepy life here, till death had taken me, if only you had not\nshown me what life might mean! Ah, child, child, why did you waken me?\"\n\n\"I?\" she breathed; and now the flush of her cheeks had widened,\nwondrously.\n\n\"You! you!\" he cried, and gave a wringing motion of his hands, for the\nself-esteem of a complacent man is not torn away without agony. \"Who\nelse but you? I had thought myself brave enough to be silent, but still\nI must play the coward's part! That woman I told you of--that woman I\nloved--was you! Yes, you, you!\" he cried, again and again, in a sort of\nfrenzy.\n\nAnd then, on a sudden, Colonel Musgrave began to laugh.\n\n\"It is very ridiculous, isn't it?\" he demanded of her. \"Yes, it is\nvery--very funny. Now comes the time to laugh at me! Now comes the time\nto lift your brows, and to make keen arrows of your eyes, and of your\ntongue a little red dagger! I have dreamed of this moment many and many\na time. So laugh, I say! Laugh, for I have told you that I love you. You\nare rich, and I am a pauper--you are young, and I am old, remember,--and\nI love you, who love another man! For the love of God, laugh at me and\nhave done--laugh! for, as God lives, it is the bravest jest I have ever\nknown!\"\n\nBut she came to him, with a wonderful gesture of compassion, and caught\nhis great, shapely hands in hers.\n\n\"I--I knew you cared,\" she breathed. \"I have always known you cared. I\nwould have been an idiot if I hadn't. But, oh, Olaf, I didn't know you\ncared so much. You frighten me, Olaf,\" she pleaded, and raised a tearful\nface to his. \"I am very fond of you, Olaf dear. Oh, don't think I am not\nfond of you.\" And the girl paused for a breathless moment. \"I think I\nmight have married you, Olaf,\" she said, half-wistfully, \"if--if it\nhadn't been for one thing.\"\n\nRudolph Musgrave smiled now, though he found it a difficult business.\n\"Yes,\" he assented, gravely, \"I know, dear. If it were not for the other\nman--that lucky devil! Yes, he is a very, very lucky devil, child, and\nhe constitutes rather a big 'if,' doesn't he?\"\n\nMiss Stapylton, too, smiled a little. \"No,\" said she, \"that isn't quite\nthe reason. The real reason is, as I told you yesterday, that I quite\nfail to see how you can expect any woman to marry you, you jay-bird, if\nyou won't go to the trouble of asking her to do so.\"\n\nAnd, this time, Miss Stapylton did not go into the house.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nWhen they went in to supper, they had planned to tell Miss Agatha of\ntheir earth-staggering secret at once. But the colonel comprehended, at\nthe first glimpse of his sister, that the opportunity would be\nill-chosen.\n\nThe meal was an awkward half-hour. Miss Agatha, from the head of the\ntable, did very little talking, save occasionally to evince views of\nlife that were both lachrymose and pugnacious. And the lovers talked\nwith desperate cheerfulness, so that there might be no outbreak so long\nas Pilkins--pre\u00ebminently ceremonious among butlers, and as yet inclined\nto scoff at the notion that the Musgraves of Matocton were not divinely\nentrusted to his guardianship,--was in the room.\n\nComing so close upon the heels of his high hour, this contretemps of\nAgatha's having one of her \"attacks,\" seemed more to Rudolph Musgrave\nthan a man need rationally bear with equanimity. Perhaps it was a trifle\nstiffly that he said he did not care for any raspberries.\n\nHis sister burst into tears.\n\n\"That's all the thanks I get. I slave my life out, and what thanks do I\nget for it? I never have any pleasure, I never put my foot out of the\nhouse except to go to market,--and what thanks do I get for it? That's\nwhat I want you to tell me with the first raspberries of the season.\nThat's what I want! Oh, I don't wonder you can't look me in the eye. And\nI wish I was dead! that's what I wish!\"\n\nColonel Musgrave did not turn at once toward Patricia, when his sister\nhad stumbled, weeping, from the dining-room.\n\n\"I--I am so sorry, Olaf,\" said a remote and tiny voice.\n\nThen he touched her hand with his finger-tips, ever so lightly. \"You\nmust not worry about it, dear. I daresay I was unpardonably brusque. And\nAgatha's health is not good, so that she is a trifle irritable at times.\nWhy, good Lord, we have these little set-to's ever so often, and never\ngive them a thought afterwards. That is one of the many things the\nfuture Mrs. Musgrave will have to get accustomed to, eh? Or does that\nappalling prospect frighten you too much?\"\n\nAnd Patricia brazenly confessed that it did not. She also made a face at\nhim, and accused Rudolph Musgrave of trying to crawl out of marrying\nher, which proceeding led to frivolities unnecessary to record, but\nfound delectable by the participants.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nColonel Musgrave was alone. He had lifted his emptied coffee-cup and he\nswished the lees gently to and fro. He was curiously intent upon these\nlees, considered them in the light of a symbol....\n\nThen a comfortable, pleasant-faced mulattress came to clear the\nsupper-table. Virginia they called her. Virginia had been nurse in turn\nto all the children of Rudolph Musgrave's parents; and to the end of her\nlife she appeared to regard the emancipation of the South's negroes as\nan irrelevant vagary of certain \"low-down\" and probably \"ornery\" Yankees\n--as an, in short, quite eminently \"tacky\" proceeding which very\ncertainly in no way affected her vested right to tyrannize over the\nMusgrave household.\n\n\"Virginia,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"don't forget to make up a fire in\nthe kitchen-stove before you go to bed. And please fill the kettle\nbefore you go upstairs, and leave it on the stove. Miss Agatha is not\nwell to-night.\"\n\n\"Yaas, suh. I unnerstan', suh,\" Virginia said, sedately.\n\nVirginia filled her tray, and went away quietly, her pleasant yellow\nface as imperturbable as an idol's.\n\n\n\n\nPART THREE - TERTIUS\n\n  \"It is in many ways made plain to us\n  That love must grow like any common thing,\n  Root, bud, and leaf, ere ripe for garnering\n  The mellow fruitage front us; even thus\n  Must Helena encounter Theseus\n  Ere Paris come, and every century\n  Spawn divers queens who die with Antony\n  But live a great while first with Julius.\n\n  \"Thus I have spoken the prologue of a play\n  Wherein I have no part, and laugh, and sit\n  Contented in the wings, whilst you portray\n  An amorous maid with gestures that befit\n  This lovely r\u00f4le,--as who knows better, pray,\n  Than I that helped you in rehearsing it?\"\n\nHorace Symonds. _Civic Voluntaries_.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nWhen the Presidential campaign was at its height; when in various\nsections of the United States \"the boy orator of La Platte\" was making\ninvidious remarks concerning the Republican Party, and in Canton (Ohio)\nMr. M.A. Hanna was cheerfully expressing his confidence as to the\noutcome of it all; when the Czar and the Czarina were visiting President\nFaure in Paris \"amid unparalleled enthusiasm\"; and when semi-educated\npeople were appraising, with a glibness possible to ignorance only, the\nliterary achievements of William Morris and George du Maurier, who had\njust died:--at this remote time, Roger Stapylton returned to Lichfield.\n\nFor in that particular October Patricia's father, an accommodating\nphysician having declared old Roger Stapylton's health to necessitate a\nSouthern sojourn, leased the Bellingham mansion in Lichfield. It\nhappened that, by rare good luck, Tom Bellingham--of the Bellinghams of\nAssequin, not the Bellinghams of Bellemeade, who indeed immigrated after\nthe War of 1812 and have never been regarded as securely established\nfrom a social standpoint,--was at this time in pecuniary difficulties on\naccount of having signed another person's name to a cheque.\n\nRoger Stapylton refurnished the house in the extreme degree of\nLichfieldian elegance. Colonel Musgrave was his mentor throughout the\nprocess; and the oldest families of Lichfield very shortly sat at table\nwith the former overseer, and not at all unwillingly, since his dinners\nwere excellent and an infatuated Rudolph Musgrave--an axiom now in\nplanning any list of guests,--was very shortly to marry the man's\ndaughter.\n\nIn fact, the matter had been settled; and Colonel Musgrave had received\nfrom Roger Stapylton an exuberantly granted charter of courtship.\n\nThis befell, indeed, upon a red letter day in Roger Stapylton's life.\nThe banker was in business matters wonderfully shrewd, as divers\ntransactions, since the signing of that half-forgotten contract whereby\nhe was to furnish a certain number of mules for the Confederate service,\nstrikingly attested: but he had rarely been out of the country wherein\nhis mother bore him; and where another nabob might have dreamed of an\nearl, or even have soared aspiringly in imagination toward a\nmarchioness-ship for his only child, old Stapylton retained unshaken\nfaith in the dust-gathering creed of his youth.\n\nHe had tolerated Pevensey, had indeed been prepared to purchase him much\nas he would have ordered any other expensive trinket or knickknack which\nPatricia desired. But he had never viewed the match with enthusiasm.\n\nNow, though, old Stapylton exulted. His daughter--half a Vartrey\nalready--would become by marriage a Musgrave of Matocton, no less. Pat's\ncarriage would roll up and down the oak-shaded avenue from which he had\nso often stepped aside with an uncovered head, while gentlemen and\nladies cantered by; and it would be Pat's children that would play about\nthe corridors of the old house at whose doors he had lived so\nlong,--those awe-inspiring corridors, which he had very rarely entered,\nexcept on Christmas Day and other recognized festivities, when, dressed\nto the nines, the overseer and his uneasy mother were by immemorial\ncustom made free of the mansion, with every slave upon the big\nplantation.\n\n\"They were good days, sir,\" he chuckled. \"Heh, we'll stick to the old\ncustoms. We'll give a dinner and announce it at dessert, just as your\nhonored grandfather did your Aunt Constantia's betrothal--\"\n\nFor about the Musgraves of Matocton there could be no question. It was\nthe old man's delight to induce Rudolph Musgrave to talk concerning his\nancestors; and Stapylton soon had their history at his finger-tips. He\ncould have correctly blazoned every tincture in their armorial bearings\nand have explained the origin of every rampant, counter-changed or\ncouchant beast upon the shield.\n\nHe knew it was the _Bona Nova_ in the November of 1619,--for the first\nMusgrave had settled in Virginia, prior to his removal to\nLichfield,--which had the honor of transporting the forebear of this\nfamily into America. Stapylton could have told you offhand which scions\nof the race had represented this or that particular county in the House\nof Burgesses, and even for what years; which three of them were\nGovernors, and which of them had served as officers of the State Line in\nthe Revolution; and, in fine, was more than satisfied to have his\ndaughter play Penelophon to Colonel Musgrave's debonair mature Cophetua.\n\nIn a word, Roger Stapylton had acquiesced to the transferal of his\ndaughter's affections with the peculiar equanimity of a properly reared\nAmerican parent. He merely stipulated that, since his business affairs\nprevented an indefinite stay in Lichfield, Colonel Musgrave should\npresently remove to New York City, where the older man held ready for\nhim a purely ornamental and remunerative position with the Insurance\nCompany of which Roger Stapylton was president.\n\nBut upon this point Rudolph Musgrave was obdurate.\n\nHe had voiced, and with sincerity, as you may remember, his desire to be\nproven upon a larger stage than Lichfield afforded. Yet the sincerity\nwas bred of an emotion it did not survive. To-day, unconsciously,\nRudolph Musgrave was reflecting that he was used to living in Lichfield,\nand would appear to disadvantage in a new surrounding, and very probably\nwould not be half so comfortable.\n\nAloud he said, in firm belief that he spoke truthfully: \"I cannot\nconscientiously give up the Library, sir. I realize the work may not\nseem important in your eyes. Indeed, in anybody's eyes it must seem an\ninadequate outcome of a man's whole life. But it unfortunately happens\nto be the only kind of work I am capable of doing. And--if you will\npardon me, sir,--I do not think it would be honest for me to accept this\ngenerous salary and give nothing in return.\"\n\nBut here Patricia broke in.\n\nPatricia agreed with Colonel Musgrave in every particular. Indeed, had\nColonel Musgrave proclaimed his intention of setting up in life as an\nassassin, Patricia would readily have asserted homicide to be the most\npraiseworthy of vocations. As it was, she devoted no little volubility\nand emphasis and eulogy to the importance of a genealogist in the\neternal scheme of things; and gave her father candidly to understand\nthat an inability to appreciate this fact was necessarily indicative of\na deplorably low order of intelligence.\n\nMusgrave was to remember--long afterward--how glorious and dear this\nbrightly-colored, mettlesome and tiny woman had seemed to him in the\nsecond display of temper he witnessed in Patricia. It was a revelation\nof an additional and as yet unsuspected adorability.\n\nHer father, though, said: \"Pat, I've suspected for a long time it was\nfoolish of me to have a red-haired daughter.\" Thus he capitulated,--and\nwith an ineffable air of routine.\n\nColonel Musgrave was, in a decorous fashion, the happiest of living\npersons.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nColonel Musgrave was, in a decorous fashion, the happiest of living\npersons....\n\nAs a token of this he devoted what little ready money he possessed to\nrenovating Matocton, where he had not lived for twenty years. He rarely\nthought of money, not esteeming it an altogether suitable subject for a\ngentleman's meditations. And to do him justice, the reflection that old\nStapylton's wealth would some day be at Rudolph Musgrave's disposal was\nnever more than an agreeable minor feature of Patricia's entourage\nwhenever, as was very often, Colonel Musgrave fell to thinking of how\nadorable Patricia was in every particular.\n\nYet there were times when he thought of Anne Charteris as well. He had\nnot seen her for a whole year now, for the Charterises had left\nLichfield shortly after the Pendomer divorce case had been settled, and\nwere still in Europe.\n\nThis was the evening during which Roger Stapylton had favorably received\nhis declaration; and Colonel Musgrave was remembering the time that he\nand Anne had last spoken with a semblance of intimacy--that caustic\ntime when Anne Charteris had interrupted him in high words with her\nhusband, and circumstances had afforded to Rudolph Musgrave no choice\nsave to confess, to this too-perfect woman, of all created beings, his\n\"true relations\" with Clarice Pendomer.\n\nEven as yet the bitterness of that humiliation was not savorless....\n\nIt seemed to him that he could never bear to think of the night when\nAnne had heard his stammerings through, and had merely listened, and in\nlistening had been unreasonably beautiful. So Godiva might have looked\non Peeping Tom, with more of wonder than of loathing, just at first....\n\nIt had been very hard to bear. But it seemed necessary. The truth would\nhave hurt Anne too much....\n\nHe noted with the gusto of a connoisseur how neatly the d\u00e9nouement of\nthis piteous farce had been prepared. His rage with Charteris; Anne's\noverhearing, and misinterpretation of, a dozen angry words; that old\naffair with Clarice--immediately before her marriage (one of how many\npleasurable gallantries? the colonel idly wondered, and regretted that\nhe had no Leporello to keep them catalogued for consultation)--and\nGeorge Pendomer's long-smoldering jealousy of Rudolph Musgrave: all\nfitted in as neatly as the bits of a puzzle.\n\nIt had been the simplest matter in the world to shield John Charteris.\nYet, the colonel wished he could be sure it was an unadulterated desire\nof protecting Anne which had moved him. There had been very certainly an\nenjoyment all the while in reflecting how nobly Rudolph Musgrave was\nbehaving for the sake of \"the only woman he had ever loved.\" Yes, one\nhad undoubtedly phrased it thus--then, and until the time one met\nPatricia.\n\nBut Anne was different, and in the nature of things must always be a\nlittle different, from all other people--even Patricia Stapylton.\n\nAlways in reverie the colonel would come back to this,--that Anne could\nnot be thought of, quite, in the same frame of mind wherein one\nappraised other persons. Especially must he concede this curious\ncircumstance whenever, as to-night, he considered divers matters that\nhad taken place quite long enough ago to have been forgotten.\n\nIt was a foolish sort of a reverie, and scarcely worth the setting down.\nIt was a reverie of the kind that everyone, and especially everyone's\nwife, admits to be mawkish and unprofitable; and yet, somehow, the next\nstill summer night, or long sleepy Sunday afternoon, or, perhaps, some\ncheap, jigging and heartbreaking melody, will set a carnival of old\nloves and old faces awhirl in the brain. One grows very sad over it, of\ncourse, and it becomes apparent that one has always been ill-treated by\nthe world; but the sadness is not unpleasant, and one is quite willing\nto forgive.\n\nYes,--it was a long, long time ago. It must have been a great number of\ncenturies. Matocton was decked in its spring fripperies of burgeoning,\nand the sky was a great, pale turquoise, and the buttercups left a\ngolden dust high up on one's trousers. One had not become entirely\naccustomed to long trousers then, and one was rather proud of them. One\nwas lying on one's back in the woods, where the birds were astir and\neager to begin their house-building, and twittered hysterically over the\npotentialities of straws and broken twigs.\n\nOverhead, the swelling buds of trees were visible against the sky, and\nthe branches were like grotesque designs on a Japanese plate. There was\na little clump of moss, very cool and soft, that just brushed one's\ncheek.\n\nOne was thinking--really thinking--for the first time in one's life;\nand, curiously enough, one was thinking about a girl, although girls\nwere manifestly of no earthly importance.\n\nBut Anne Willoughby was different. Even at the age when girls seemed\nfeckless creatures, whose aimings were inexplicable, both as concerned\nexistence in general, and, more concretely, as touched gravel-shooters\nand snowballs, and whose reasons for bursting into tears were recondite,\none had perceived the difference. One wondered about it from time to\ntime.\n\nGradually, there awoke an uneasy self-conscious interest as to all\nmatters that concerned her, a mental pricking up of the ears when her\nname was mentioned.\n\nOne lay awake o' nights, wondering why her hair curled so curiously\nabout her temples, and held such queer glowing tints in its depths when\nsunlight fell upon it. One was uncomfortable and embarrassed and\nBriarean-handed in her presence, but with her absence came the\noverwhelming desire of seeing her again.\n\nAfter a little, it was quite understood that one was in love with Anne\nWilloughby....\n\nIt was a matter of minor importance that her father was the wealthiest\nman in Fairhaven, and that one's mother was poor. One would go away into\nforeign lands after a while, and come back with a great deal of\nmoney,--lakes of rupees and pieces of eight, probably. It was very\nsimple.\n\nBut Anne's father had taken an unreasonable view of the matter, and\ncarried Anne off to a terrible aunt, who returned one's letters\nunopened. That was the end of Anne Willoughby.\n\nThen, after an interval--during which one fell in and out of love\nassiduously, and had upon the whole a pleasant time,--Anne Charteris had\ncome to Lichfield. One had found that time had merely added poise and\nself-possession and a certain opulence to the beauty which had caused\none's voice to play fantastic tricks in conference with Anne\nWilloughby,--ancient, unforgotten conferences, wherein one had pointed\nout the many respects in which she differed from all other women, and\nthe perfect feasibility of marrying on nothing a year.\n\nMuch as one loved Patricia, and great as was one's happiness, men did\nnot love as boys did, after all....\n\n\"'Ah, Boy, it is a dream for life too high,'\" said Colonel Musgrave, in\nhis soul. \"And now let's think of something sensible. Let's think about\nthe present political crisis, and what to give the groomsmen, and how\nmuch six times seven is. Meanwhile, you are not the fellow in _Aux\nItaliens_, you know; you are not bothered by the faint, sweet smell of\nany foolish jasmine-flower, you understand, or by any equally foolish\nhankerings after your lost youth. You are simply a commonplace,\nevery-day sort of man, not thoroughly hardened as yet to being engaged,\nand you are feeling a bit pulled down to-night, because your liver or\nsomething is out of sorts.\"\n\nUpon reflection, Colonel Musgrave was quite sure that he was happy; and\nthat it was only his liver or something which was upset. But, at all\nevents, the colonel's besetting infirmity was always to shrink from\nmaking changes; instinctively he balked against commission of any action\nwhich would alter his relations with accustomed circumstances or\npersons. It was very like Rudolph Musgrave that even now, for all the\nglow of the future's bright allure, his heart should hark back to the\npast and its absurd dear memories, with wistfulness.\n\nAnd he found it, as many others have done, but cheerless sexton's work,\nthis digging up of boyish recollections. One by one, they come to\nlight--the brave hopes and dreams and aspirations of youth; the ruddy\nlife has gone out of them; they have shriveled into an alien, pathetic\ndignity. They might have been one's great-grandfather's or Hannibal's or\nAdam's; the boy whose life was swayed by them is quite as dead as these.\n\nAmaryllis is dead, too. Perhaps, you drop in of an afternoon to talk\nover old happenings. She is perfectly affable. She thinks it is time you\nwere married. She thinks it very becoming, the way you have stoutened.\nAnd, no, they weren't at the Robinsons'; that was the night little\nAmaryllis was threatened with croup.\n\nThen, after a little, the lamps of welcome are lighted in her eyes, her\nbreath quickens, her cheeks mount crimson flags in honor of her lord,\nher hero, her conqueror.\n\nIt is Mr. Grundy, who is happy to meet you, and hopes you will stay to\ndinner. He patronizes you a trifle; his wife, you see, has told him all\nabout that boy who is as dead as Hannibal. You don't mind in the least;\nyou dine with Mr. and Mrs. Grundy, and pass a very pleasant evening.\n\nColonel Musgrave had dined often with the Charterises.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nAnd then some frolic god, _en route_ from homicide by means of an\nunloaded pistol in Chicago for the demolishment of a likely ship off\nPalos, with the co\u00f6perancy of a defective pistonrod, stayed in his\nflight to bring Joe Parkinson to Lichfield.\n\nIt was Roger Stapylton who told the colonel of this advent, as the very\napex of jocularity.\n\n\"For you remember the Parkinsons, I suppose?\"\n\n\"The ones that had a cabin near Matocton? Very deserving people, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"And _their_ son, sir, wants to marry my daughter,\" said Mr.\nStapylton,--\"_my_ daughter, who is shortly to be connected by marriage\nwith the Musgraves of Matocton! I don't know what this world will come\nto next.\"\n\nIt was a treat to see him shake his head in deprecation of such anarchy.\n\nThen Roger Stapylton said, more truculently: \"Yes, sir! on account of a\nboy-and-girl affair five years ago, this half-strainer, this poor-white\ntrash, has actually had the presumption, sir,--but I don't doubt that\nPat has told you all about it?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Colonel Musgrave. \"She did not mention it this\nafternoon. She was not feeling very well. A slight headache. I noticed\nshe was not inclined to conversation.\"\n\nIt had just occurred to him, as mildly remarkable, that Patricia had\nnever at any time alluded to any one of those countless men who must\nhave inevitably made love to her.\n\n\"Though, mind you, I don't say anything against Joe. He's a fine young\nfellow. Paid his own way through college. Done good work in Panama and\nin Alaska too. But--confound it, sir, the boy's a fool! Now I put it to\nyou fairly, ain't he a fool?\" said Mr. Stapylton.\n\n\"Upon my word, sir, if his folly has no other proof than an adoration of\nyour daughter,\" the colonel protested, \"I must in self-defense beg leave\nto differ with you.\"\n\nYes, that was it undoubtedly. Patricia had too high a sense of honor to\nexhibit these defeated rivals in a ridiculous light, even to him. It was\na revelation of an additional and as yet unsuspected adorability.\n\nThen after a little further talk they separated. Colonel Musgrave left\nthat night for Matocton in order to inspect the improvements which were\nbeing made there. He was to return to Lichfield on the ensuing\nWednesday, when his engagement to Patricia was to be announced--\"just\nas your honored grandfather did your Aunt Constantia's betrothal.\"\n\nMeanwhile Joe Parkinson, a young man much enamored, who fought the world\nby ordinary like Hal o' the Wynd, \"for his own hand,\" was seeing\nPatricia every day.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nColonel Musgrave remained five days at Matocton, that he might put his\nhouse in order against his nearing marriage. It was a pleasant sight to\nsee the colonel stroll about the paneled corridors and pause to chat\nwith divers deferential workmen who were putting the last touches there,\nor to observe him mid-course in affable consultation with gardeners\nanent the rolling of a lawn or the retrimming of a rosebush, and to mark\nthe bearing of the man so optimistically colored by goodwill toward the\nsolar system.\n\nHe joyed in his old home,--in the hipped roof of it, the mullioned\ncasements, the wide window-seats, the high and spacious rooms, the\ngeometrical gardens and broad lawns, in all that was quaint and\nbeautiful at Matocton,--because it would be Patricia's so very soon, the\nlovely frame of a yet lovelier picture, as the colonel phrased it with a\nflight of imagery.\n\nGravely he inspected all the portraits of his feminine ancestors that he\nmight decide, as one without bias, whether Matocton had ever boasted a\nmore delectable mistress. Equity--or in his fond eyes at\nleast,--demanded a negative. Only in one of these canvases, a\ncounterfeit of Miss Evelyn Ramsay, born a Ramsay of Blenheim, that had\nmarried the common great-great-grandfather of both the colonel and\nPatricia--Major Orlando Musgrave, an aide-de-camp to General Charles Lee\nin the Revolution,--Rudolph Musgrave found, or seemed to find, dear\nlikenesses to that demented seraph who was about to stoop to his\nunworthiness.\n\nHe spent much time before this portrait. Yes, yes! this woman had been\nlovely in her day. And this bright, roguish shadow of her was lovely,\ntoo, eternally postured in white patnet, trimmed with a vine of\nrose-colored satin leaves, a pink rose in her powdered hair and a huge\nostrich plume as well.\n\nYet it was an adamantean colonel that remarked:\n\n\"My dear, perhaps it is just as fortunate as not that you have quitted\nMatocton. For I have heard tales of you, Miss Ramsay. Oh, no! I honestly\ndo not believe that you would have taken kindlily to any young\nperson--not even in the guise of a great-great-grand-daughter,--to whom\nyou cannot hold a candle, madam. A fico for you, madam,\" said the most\nundutiful of great-great-grandsons.\n\nLet us leave him to his roseate meditations. Questionless, in the woman\nhe loved there was much of his own invention: but the circumstance is\nnot unhackneyed; and Colonel Musgrave was in a decorous fashion the\nhappiest of living persons.\n\nMeanwhile Joe Parkinson, a young man much enamored, who fought the\nworld by ordinary, like Hal o' the Wynd \"for his own hand,\" was seeing\nPatricia every day.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nJoe Parkinson--tall and broad-shouldered, tanned, resolute, chary of\nspeech, decisive in gesture, having close-cropped yellow hair and frank,\nkeen eyes like amethysts,--was the one alien present when Colonel\nMusgrave came again into Roger Stapylton's fine and choicely-furnished\nmansion.\n\nThis was on the evening Roger Stapylton gave the long-anticipated dinner\nat which he was to announce his daughter's engagement. As much indeed\nwas suspected by most of his dinner-company, so carefully selected from\nthe aristocracy of Lichfield; and the heart of the former overseer, as\nthese handsome, courtly and sweet voiced people settled according to\ntheir rank about his sumptuous table, was aglow with pride.\n\nThen Rudolph Musgrave turned to his companion and said softly: \"My dear,\nyou are like a wraith. What is it?\"\n\n\"I have a headache,\" said Patricia. \"It is nothing.\"\n\n\"You reassure me,\" the colonel gaily declared, \"for I had feared it was\na heartache--\"\n\nShe faced him. Desperation looked out of her purple eyes. \"It is,\" the\ngirl said swiftly.\n\n\"Ah--?\" Only it was an intake of the breath, rather than an\ninterjection. Colonel Musgrave ate his fish with deliberation. \"Young\nParkinson?\" he presently suggested.\n\n\"I thought I had forgotten him. I didn't know I cared--I didn't know I\n_could_ care so much--\" And there was a note in her voice which thrust\nthe poor colonel into an abyss of consternation.\n\n\"Remember that these people are your guests,\" he said, in perfect\nearnest.\n\n\"--and I refused him this afternoon for the last time, and he is going\naway to-morrow--\"\n\nBut here Judge Allardyce broke in, to tell Miss Stapylton of the\npleasure with which he had _nolle prosequied_ the case against Tom\nBellingham.\n\n\"A son of my old schoolmate, ma'am,\" the judge explained. \"A Bellingham\nof Assequin. Oh, indiscreet of course--but, God bless my soul! when were\nthe Bellinghams anything else? The boy regretted it as much as anybody.\"\n\nAnd she listened with almost morbid curiosity concerning the finer\ndetails of legal intricacy.\n\nColonel Musgrave was mid-course in an anecdote which the lady upon the\nother side of him found wickedly amusing.\n\nHe was very gay. He had presently secured the attention of the company\nat large, and held it through a good half-hour; for by common consent\nRudolph Musgrave was at his best to-night, and Lichfield found his best\nworth listening to.\n\n\"Grinning old popinjay!\" thought Mr. Parkinson; and envied him and\ninternally noted, and with an unholy fervor cursed, the adroitness of\nintonation and the discreetly modulated gesture with which the colonel\ngave to every point of his merry-Andrewing its precise value.\n\nThe colonel's mind was working busily on matters oddly apart from those\nof which he talked. He wanted this girl next to him--at whom he did not\nlook. He loved her as that whippersnapper yonder was not capable of\nloving anyone. Young people had these fancies; and they outlived them,\nas the colonel knew of his own experience. Let matters take their course\nunhindered, at all events by him. For it was less his part than that of\nany other man alive to interfere when Rudolph Musgrave stood within a\nfinger's reach of, at worst, his own prosperity and happiness.\n\nHe would convey no note to Roger Stapylton. Let the banker announce the\nengagement. Let the young fellow go to the devil. Colonel Musgrave would\nmarry the girl and make Patricia, at worst, content. To do otherwise,\neven to hesitate, would be the emptiest quixotism....\n\nThen came the fatal thought, \"But what a gesture!\" To fling away his\nhappiness--yes, even his worldly fortune,--and to do it smilingly!\nPatricia must, perforce, admire him all her life.\n\nThen as old Stapylton stirred in his chair and broke into a wide\npremonitory smile, Colonel Musgrave rose to his feet. And of that\ncompany Clarice Pendomer at least thought of how like he was to the boy\nwho had fought the famous duel with George Pendomer some fifteen years\nago.\n\nEnsued a felicitous speech. Rudolph Musgrave was familiar with his\naudience. And therefore:\n\nColonel Musgrave alluded briefly to the pleasure he took in addressing\nsuch a gathering. He believed no other State in the 'Union could have\nafforded an assembly of more distinguished men and fairer women. But the\nfact was not unnatural; they might recall the venerable saying that\nblood will tell? Well, it was their peculiar privilege to represent\nto-day that sturdy stock which, when this great republic was in the\npangs of birth, had with sword and pen and oratory discomfited the\nhirelings of England and given to history the undying names of several\nRevolutionary patriots,--all of whom he enumerated with the customary\npause after each cognomen to allow for the customary applause.\n\nAnd theirs, too, was the blood of those heroic men who fought more\nrecently beneath the stars and bars, as bravely, he would make bold to\nsay, as Leonidas at Thermopylae, in defense of their loved Southland.\nRight, he conceded, had not triumphed here. For hordes of brutal\nsoldiery had invaded the fertile soil, the tempest of war had swept the\nland and left it desolate. The South lay battered and bruised, and pros\ntrate in blood, the \"Niobe of nations,\" as sad a victim of ingratitude\nas King Lear.\n\nThe colonel touched upon the time when buzzards, in the guise of\ncarpet-baggers, had battened upon the recumbent form; and spoke\nslightingly of divers persons of antiquity as compared with various\nConfederate leaders, whose names were greeted with approving nods and\nripples of polite enthusiasm.\n\nBut the South, and in particular the grand old Commonwealth which they\ninhabited, he stated, had not long sat among the ruins of her temples,\nlike a sorrowing priestess with veiled eyes and a depressed soul,\nmourning for that which had been. Like the fabled Phoenix, she had risen\nfrom the ashes of her past. To-day she was once more to be seen in her\nhereditary position, the brightest gem in all that glorious galaxy of\nStates which made America the envy of every other nation. Her\nbattlefields converted into building lots, tall factories smoked where\nonce a holocaust had flamed, and where cannon had roared you heard\nto-day the tinkle of the school bell. Such progress was without a\nparallel.\n\nNor was there any need for him, he was assured, to mention the\nimperishable names of their dear homeland's poets and statesmen of\nto-day, the orators and philanthropists and prominent business-men who\njostled one another in her splendid, new asphalted streets, since all\nwere quite familiar to his audience,--as familiar, he would venture to\npredict, as they would eventually be to the most cherished recollections\nof Macaulay's prophesied New Zealander, when this notorious antipodean\nshould pay his long expected visit to the ruins of St. Paul's.\n\nIn fine, by a natural series of transitions, Colonel Musgrave thus\nworked around to \"the very pleasing duty with which our host, in view of\nthe long and intimate connection between our families, has seen fit to\nhonor me\"--which was, it developed, to announce the imminent marriage of\nMiss Patricia Stapylton and Mr. Joseph Parkinson.\n\nIt may conservatively be stated that everyone was surprised.\n\nOld Stapylton had half risen, with a purple face.\n\nThe colonel viewed him with a look of bland interrogation.\n\nThere was silence for a heart-beat.\n\nThen Stapylton lowered his eyes, if just because the laws of caste had\ntriumphed, and in consequence his glance crossed that of his daughter,\nwho sat motionless regarding him. She was an unusually pretty girl, he\nthought, and he had always been inordinately proud of her. It was not\npride she seemed to beg him muster now. Patricia through that moment was\nnot the fine daughter the old man was sometimes half afraid of. She was,\ntoo, like a certain defiant person--oh, of an incredible beauty, such\nas women had not any longer!--who had hastily put aside her bonnet and\nhad looked at a young Roger Stapylton in much this fashion very long\nago, because the minister was coming downstairs, and they would\npresently be man and wife,--provided always her pursuing brothers did\nnot arrive in time....\n\nOld Roger Stapylton cleared his throat.\n\nOld Roger Stapylton said, half sheepishly: \"My foot's asleep, that's\nall. I beg everybody's pardon, I'm sure. Please go on\"--he had come\nwithin an ace of saying \"Mr. Rudolph,\" and only in the nick of time did\nhe continue, \"Colonel Musgrave.\"\n\nSo the colonel continued in time-hallowed form, with happy allusions to\nMr. Parkinson's anterior success as an engineer before he came \"like a\nyoung Lochinvar to wrest away his beautiful and popular fianc\u00e9e from us\nfainthearted fellows of Lichfield\"; touched of course upon the colonel's\npersonal comminglement of envy and rage, and so on, as an old bachelor\nwho saw too late what he had missed in life; and concluded by proposing\nthe health of the young couple.\n\nThis was drunk with all the honors.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nUpon what Patricia said to the colonel in the drawing-room, what Joe\nParkinson blurted out in the hall, and chief of all, what Roger\nStapylton asseverated to Rudolph Musgrave in the library, after the\nother guests had gone, it is unnecessary to dwell in this place. To each\nof these in various fashions did Colonel Musgrave explain such reasons\nas, he variously explained, must seem to any gentleman sufficient cause\nfor acting as he had done; but most candidly, and even with a touch of\neloquence, to Roger Stapylton.\n\n\"You are like your grandfather, sir, at times,\" the latter said,\ninconsequently enough, when the colonel had finished.\n\nAnd Rudolph Musgrave gave a little bowing gesture, with an entire\ngravity. He knew it was the highest tribute that Stapylton could pay to\nany man.\n\n\"She's a daughter any father might be proud of,\" said the banker, also.\nHe removed his cigar from his mouth and looked at it critically. \"She's\nrather like her mother sometimes,\" he said carelessly. \"Her mother made\na runaway match, you may remember--Damn' poor cigar, this. But no, you\nwouldn't, I reckon. I had branched out into cotton then and had a little\nplace just outside of Chiswick--\"\n\nSo that, all in all, Colonel Musgrave returned homeward not entirely\ndissatisfied.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe colonel sat for a long while before his fire that night. The room\nseemed less comfortable than he had ever known it. So many of his books\nand pictures and other furnishings had been already carried to Matocton\nthat the walls were a little bare. Also there was a formidable pile of\nbills upon the table by him,--from contractors and upholsterers and\nfurniture-houses, and so on, who had been concerned in the late\nrenovation of Matocton,--the heralds of a host he hardly saw his way to\ndealing with.\n\nHe had flung away a deal of money that evening, with something which to\nhim was dearer. Had you attempted to condole with him he would not have\nunderstood you.\n\n\"But what would you have had a gentleman do, sir?\" Colonel Musgrave\nwould have said, in real perplexity.\n\nBesides, it was, in fact, not sorrow that he felt, rather it was\ncontentment, when he remembered the girl's present happiness; and what\nalone depressed the colonel's courtly affability toward the universe at\nlarge was the queer, horrible new sense of being somehow out of touch\nwith yesterday's so comfortable world, of being out-moded, of being\nalmost old.\n\n\"Eh, well!\" he said; \"I am of a certain age undoubtedly.\"\n\nBy an odd turn the colonel thought of how his friends of his own class\nand generation had honestly admired the after-dinner speech which he had\nmade that evening. And he smiled, but very tenderly, because they were\nall men and women whom he loved.\n\n\"The most of us have known each other for a long while. The most of us,\nin fact, are of a certain age.... I think no people ever met the sorry\nproblem that we faced. For we were born the masters of a leisured,\nordered world; and by a tragic quirk of destiny were thrust into a quite\nnew planet, where we were for a while the inferiors, and after that just\nthe competitors of yesterday's slaves.\n\n\"We couldn't meet the new conditions. Oh, for the love of heaven, let us\nbe frank, and confess that we have not met them as things practical go.\nWe hadn't the training for it. A man who has not been taught to swim may\nrationally be excused for preferring to sit upon the bank; and should he\nelect to ornament his idleness with protestations that he is\nself-evidently an excellent swimmer, because once upon a time his\nprogenitors were the only people in the world who had the slightest\nconception of how to perform a natatorial masterpiece, the thing is\nsimply human nature. Talking chokes nobody, worse luck.\n\n\"And yet we haven't done so badly. For the most part we have sat upon\nthe bank our whole lives long. We have produced nothing--after\nall--which was absolutely earth-staggering; and we have talked a deal of\nclap-trap. But meanwhile we have at least enhanced the comeliness of our\nparticular sand-bar. We have lived a courteous and tranquil and\nindependent life thereon, just as our fathers taught us. It may be--in\nthe final outcome of things--that will be found an even finer pursuit\nthan the old one of producing Presidents.\n\n\"Besides, we have produced ourselves. We have been gentlefolk in spite\nof all, we have been true even in our iniquities to the traditions of\nour race. No, I cannot assert that these traditions always square with\nethics or even with the Decalogue, for we have added a very complex\nEleventh Commandment concerning honor. And for the rest, we have\ndefiantly embroidered life, and indomitably we have converted the\ncommonest happening of life into a comely thing. We have been artists if\nnot artizans.\"\n\nThere was upon the table a large photograph in sepia of Patricia\nStapylton. He studied this now. She was very beautiful, he thought.\n\n\"'Nor thou detain her vesture's hem'--\" said the colonel aloud. \"Oh,\nthat infernal Yankee understood, even though he was born in Boston!\" And\nthis as coming from a Musgrave of Matocton, may fairly be considered as\na sweeping tribute to the author of _Give All to Love_.\n\nColonel Musgrave was intent upon the portrait.... So! she had chosen at\nlast between himself and this young fellow, a workman born of workmen,\nwho went about the world building bridges and canals and tunnels and\nsuch, in those far countries which were to Colonel Musgrave just so many\ngray or pink or fawn-colored splotches on the map. It seemed to Colonel\nMusgrave almost an allegory.\n\nSo Colonel Musgrave filled a glass with the famed Lafayette madeira of\nMatocton, and solemnly drank yet another toast. He loved to do, as you\nalready know, that which was colorful.\n\n\"To this new South,\" he said. \"To this new South that has not any longer\nneed of me or of my kind.\n\n\"To this new South! She does not gaze unwillingly, nor too complacently,\nupon old years, and dares concede that but with loss of manliness may\nany man encroach upon the heritage of a dog or of a trotting-horse, and\nconsider the exploits of an ancestor to guarantee an innate and personal\nexcellence.\n\n\"For to her all former glory is less a jewel than a touchstone, and with\nher portion of it daily she appraises her own doing, and without vain\nspeech. And her high past she values now, in chief, as fit foundation of\nthat edifice whereon she labors day by day, and with augmenting\nstrokes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd yet--\"It may be he will serve you better. But, oh, it isn't\npossible that he should love you more than I,\" said Colonel Musgrave of\nMatocton.\n\nThe man was destined to remember that utterance--and, with the\nrecollection, to laugh not altogether in either scorn or merriment.\n\n\n\n\nPART FOUR - APPRECIATION\n\n  \"You have chosen; and I cry content thereto,\n  And cry your pardon also, and am reproved\n  In that I took you for a woman I loved\n  Odd centuries ago, and would undo\n  That curious error. Nay, your eyes are blue,\n  Your speech is gracious, but you are not she,\n  And I am older--and changed how utterly!--\n  I am no longer I, you are not you.\n\n  \"Time, destined as we thought but to befriend\n  And guerdon love like ours, finds you beset\n  With joys and griefs I neither share nor mend\n  Who am a stranger; and we two are met\n  Nor wholly glad nor sorry; and the end\n  Of too much laughter is a faint regret.\"\n\nR.E. TOWNSEND. _Sonnets for Elena._\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nNext morning Rudolph Musgrave found the world no longer an impassioned\nplace, but simply a familiar habitation,--no longer the wrestling-ground\nof big emotions, indeed, but undoubtedly a spot, whatever were its other\npretensions to praise, wherein one was at home. He breakfasted on ham\nand eggs, in a state of tolerable equanimity; and mildly wondered at\nhimself for doing it.\n\nThe colonel was deep in a heraldic design and was whistling through his\nteeth when Patricia came into the Library. He looked up, with the\noutlines of a frown vanishing like pencilings under the india-rubber of\nprofessional courtesy,--for he was denoting _or_ at the moment, which is\nfussy work, as it consists exclusively of dots.\n\nThen his chair scraped audibly upon the floor as he pushed it from him.\nIt occurred to Rudolph Musgrave after an interval that he was still\nhalf-way between sitting and standing, and that his mouth was open....\n\nHe could hear a huckster outside on Regis Avenue. The colonel never\nforgot the man was crying \"Fresh oranges!\"\n\n\"He kissed me, Olaf. Yes, I let him kiss me, even after he had asked me\nif he could. No sensible girl would ever do that, of course. And then I\nknew--\"\n\nPatricia was horribly frightened.\n\n\"And afterwards the jackass-fool made matters worse by calling me 'his\ndarling.' There is no more hateful word in the English language than\n'darling.' It sounds like castor-oil tastes, or a snail looks after you\nhave put salt on him.\"\n\nThe colonel deliberated this information; and he appeared to understand.\n\n\"So Parkinson has gone the way of Pevensey,--. and of I wonder how many\nothers? Well, may Heaven be very gracious to us both!\" he said. \"For I\nam going to do it.\"\n\nThen composedly he took up the telephone upon his desk and called Roger\nStapylton.\n\n\"I want you to come at once to Dr. Rabbet's,--yes, the rectory, next\ndoor to St. Luke's. Patricia and I are to be married there in half an\nhour. We are on our way to the City Hall to get the license now.... No,\nshe might change her mind again, you see.... I have not the least notion\nhow it happened. I don't care.... Then you will have to be rude to him\nor else not see your only daughter married.... Kindly permit me to\nrepeat, sir, that I don't care about that or anything else. And for the\nrest, Patricia was twenty-one last December.\"\n\nThe colonel hung up the receiver. \"And now,\" he said, \"we are going to\nthe City Hall.\"\n\n\"Are you?\" said Patricia, with courteous interest. \"Well, my way lies\nuptown. I have to stop in at Greenberg's and get a mustard plaster for\nthe parrot.\"\n\nHe had his hat by this. \"It isn't cool enough for me to need an\novercoat, is it?\"\n\n\"I think you must be crazy,\" she said, sharply.\n\n\"Of course I am. So I am going to marry you.\"\n\n\"Let me go--! Oh, and I had thought you were a gentleman--.\"\n\n\"I fear that at present I am simply masculine.\" He became aware that his\nhands, in gripping both her shoulders, were hurting the girl.\n\n\"Come now,\" he continued, \"will you go quietly or will I have to carry\nyou?\"\n\nShe said, \"And you would, too--.\" She spoke in wonder, for Patricia had\nglimpsed an unguessed Rudolph Musgrave.\n\nHis hands went under her arm-pits and he lifted her like a feather. He\nheld her thus at arm's length.\n\n\"You--you adorable whirligig!\" he laughed. \"I am a stronger animal than\nyou. It would be as easy for me to murder you as it would be for you to\nkill one of those flies on the window-pane. Do you quite understand that\nfact, Patricia?\"\n\n\"Oh, but you are an idiot--.\"\n\n\"In wanting you, my dear?\"\n\n\"Please put me down.\"\n\nShe thoroughly enjoyed her helplessness. He saw it, long before he\nlowered her.\n\n\"Why, not so much in that,\" said Miss Stapylton, \"because inasmuch as I\nam a woman of superlative charm, of course you can't help yourself. But\nhow do you know that Dr. Rabbet may not be somewhere else, harrying a\ndefenseless barkeeper, or superintending the making of dress-shirt\nprotectors for the Hottentots, or doing something else clerical, when we\nget to the rectory?\"\n\nAfter an irrelevant interlude she stamped her foot.\n\n\"I don't care what you say, I won't marry an atheist. If you had the\nleast respect for his cloth, Olaf, you would call him up and\narrange--Oh, well! whatever you want to arrange--and permit me to powder\nmy nose without being bothered, because I don't want people to think you\nare marrying a second helping to butter, and I never did like that\nBaptist man on the block above, anyhow. And besides,\" said Patricia, as\nwith the occurrence of a new view-point, \"think what a delicious scandal\nit will create!\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nPatricia spoke the truth. By supper-time Lichfield had so industriously\nembroidered the Stapylton dinner and the ensuing marriage with\nhypotheses and explanations and unparented rumors that none of the\nparticipants in the affair but could advantageously have exchanged\nreputations with Benedict Arnold or Lucretia Borgia, had Lichfield\nbelieved a tithe of what Lichfield was repeating.\n\nA duel was of course anticipated between Mr. Parkinson and Colonel\nMusgrave, and the colonel indeed offered, through Major Wadleigh, any\nsatisfaction which Mr. Parkinson might desire.\n\nThe engineer, with garnishments of profanity, considered dueling to be a\npainstakingly-described absurdity and wished \"the old popinjay\" joy of\nhis bargain.\n\nLichfield felt that only showed what came of treating poor-white trash\nas your equals, and gloried in the salutary moral.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nMeanwhile the two originators of so much Lichfieldian diversion were not\nunhappy.\n\nBut indeed it were irreverent even to try to express the happiness of\ntheir earlier married life ...\n\nThey were an ill-matched couple in so many ways that no long-headed\nperson could conceivably have anticipated--in the outcome--more than\ndecorous tolerance of each other. For apart from the disparity in age\nand tastes and rearing, there was always the fact to be weighed that in\nmarrying the only child of a wealthy man Rudolph Musgrave was making\nwhat Lichfield called \"an eminently sensible match\"--than which, as\nLichfield knew, there is no more infallible recipe for discord.\n\nIn this case the axiom seemed, after the manner of all general rules, to\nbulwark itself with an exception. Colonel Musgrave continued to emanate\nan air of contentment which fell perilously short of fatuity; and that\nPatricia was honestly fond of him was evident to the most impecunious of\nLichfield's bachelors.\n\nTrue, curtains had been lifted, a little by a little. Patricia could\nhardly have told you at what exact moment it was that she discovered\nMiss Agatha--who continued of course to live with them--was a\ndipsomaniac. Very certainly Rudolph Musgrave was not Patricia's\ninformant; it is doubtful if the colonel ever conceded his sister's\ninfirmity in his most private meditations; so that Patricia found the\ncause of Miss Agatha's \"attacks\" to be an open secret of which everyone\nin the house seemed aware and of which by tacit agreement nobody ever\nspoke. It bewildered Patricia, at first, to find that as concerned\nLichfield at large any over-indulgence in alcohol by a member of the\nMusgrave family was satisfactorily accounted for by the matter-of-course\nstatement that the Musgraves usually \"drank,\"--just as the Allardyces\nnotoriously perpetuated the taint of insanity, and the Townsends were\nproverbially unable \"to let women alone,\" and the Vartreys were\ndeplorably prone to dabble in literature. These things had been for a\nlong while just as they were to-day; and therefore (Lichfield estimated)\nthey must be reasonable.\n\nThen, too, Patricia would have preferred to have been rid of the old\nmulatto woman Virginia, because it was through Virginia that Miss Agatha\nfurtively procured intoxicants. But Rudolph Musgrave would not consider\nVirginia's leaving. \"Virginia's faithfulness has been proven by too many\nyears of faithful service\" was the formula with which he dismissed the\nsuggestion ... Afterward Patricia learned from Miss Agatha of the wrong\nthat had been done Virginia by Olaf's uncle, Senator Edward Musgrave,\nthe noted ante-bellum orator, and understood that Olaf--without, of\ncourse, conceding it to himself, because that was Olaf's way--was trying\nto make reparation. Patricia respected the sentiment, and continued to\nfret under its manifestation.\n\nMiss Agatha also told Patricia of how the son of Virginia and Senator\nMusgrave had come to a disastrous end--\"lynched in Texas, I believe,\nonly it may not have been Texas. And indeed when I come to think of it,\nI don't believe it was, because I know we first heard of it on a Monday,\nand Virginia couldn't do the washing that week and I had to send it out.\nAnd for the usual crime, of course. It simply shows you how much better\noff the darkies were before the War,\" Miss Agatha said.\n\nPatricia refrained from comment, not being willing to consider the\ndeduction strained. For love is a contagious infection; and loving\nRudolph Musgrave so much, Patricia must perforce love any person whom he\nloved as conscientiously as she would have strangled any person with\nwhom he had flirted.\n\nAnd yet, to Patricia, it was beginning to seem that Patricia Musgrave\nwas not living, altogether, in that Lichfield which John Charteris has\nmade immortal--\"that nursery of Free Principles\" (according to the\n_Lichfield Courier-Herald_) \"wherein so many statesmen,\nlieutenants-general and orators were trained to further the faith of\ntheir fathers, to thrill the listening senates, draft constitutions, and\nbruise the paws of the British lion.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIt may be remembered that Lichfield had asked long ago, \"But who, pray,\nare the Stapyltons?\" It was characteristic of Colonel Musgrave that he\nwent about answering the question without delay. The Stapletons--for\n\"Stapylton\" was a happy innovation of Roger Stapylton's dead wife--the\ncolonel knew to have been farmers in Brummell County, and Brummell\nCourthouse is within an hour's ride, by rail, of Lichfield.\n\nSo he set about his labor of love.\n\nAnd in it he excelled himself. The records of Brummell date back to 1750\nand are voluminous; but Rudolph Musgrave did not overlook an item in any\nWill Book, or in any Orders of the Court, that pertained, however\nremotely, to the Stapletons. Then he renewed his labors at the\ncourthouse of the older county from which Brummell was formed in 1750,\nand through many fragmentary, evil-odored and unindexed volumes\nindefatigably pursued the family's fortune back to the immigration of\nits American progenitor in 1619,--and, by the happiest fatality, upon\nthe same _Bona Nova_ which enabled the first American Musgrave to grace\nthe Colony of Virginia with his presence. It could no longer be said\nthat the wife of a Musgrave of Matocton lacked an authentic and\ntolerably ancient pedigree.\n\nThe colonel made a book of his Stapyltonian researches which he\nvaingloriously proclaimed to be the stupidest reading within the ample\nfield of uninteresting printed English. Patricia was allowed to see no\nword of it until the first ten copies had come from the printer's, very\nsplendid in green \"art-vellum\" and stamped with the Stapylton\ncoat-of-arms in gold.\n\nShe read the book. \"It is perfectly superb,\" was her verdict. \"It is as\ndear as remembered kisses after death and as sweet as a plaintiff in a\nbreach-of-promise suit. Only I would have preferred it served with a few\nkings and dukes for parsley. The Stapletons don't seem to have been\nanything but perfectly respectable mediocrities.\"\n\nThe colonel smiled. At the bottom of his heart he shared Patricia's\nregret that the Stapylton pedigree was unadorned by a potentate, because\nnobody can stay unimpressed by a popular superstition, however crass the\nthing may be. But for all this, an appraisal of himself and his own\nachievements profusely showed high lineage is not invariably a guarantee\nof excellence; and so he smiled and said:\n\n\"There are two ends to every stick. It was the Stapletons and others of\ntheir sort, rather than any soft-handed Musgraves, who converted a\nwilderness, a little by a little, into the America of to-day. The task\nwas tediously achieved, and without ostentation; and always the ship had\nits resplendent figure-head, as always it had its hidden, nay! grimy,\nengines, which propelled the ship. And, however direfully America may\ndiffer from Utopia, to have assisted in the making of America is no mean\ndistinction. We Musgraves and our peers, I sometimes think, may possibly\nhave been just gaudy autumn leaves which happened to lie in the path of\na high wind. And to cut a gallant figure in such circumstances does not\nnecessarily prove the performer to be a _rara avis_, even though he\nrides the whirlwind quite as splendidly as any bird existent.\"\n\nPatricia fluttered, and as lightly and irresponsibly as a wren might\nhave done, perched on his knee.\n\n\"No! there is really something in heredity, after all. Now, you are a\nMusgrave in every vein of you. It always seems like a sort of flippancy\nfor you to appear in public without a stock and a tarnished gilt frame\nwith most of the gilt knocked off and a catalogue-number tucked in the\ncorner.\" Patricia spoke without any regard for punctuation. \"And I am so\nunlike you. I am only a Stapylton. I do hope you don't mind my being\nmerely a Stapylton, Olaf, because if only I wasn't too modest to even\nthink of alluding to the circumstance, I would try to tell you about the\ntiniest fraction of how much a certain ravishingly beautiful\nhalf-strainer loves you, Olaf, and the consequences would be\ndeplorable.\"\n\n\"My dear----\" he began.\n\n\"Ouch!\" said Patricia; \"you are tickling me. You don't shave half as\noften as you used to, do you? No, nowadays you think you have me safe\nand don't have to bother about being attractive. If I had a music-box I\ncould put your face into it and play all sorts of tunes, only I prefer\nto look at it. You are a slattern and a jay-bird and a joy forever. And\nbesides, the first Stapleton seems to have blundered somehow into the\nHouse of Burgesses, so that entitles me to be a Colonial Dame on my\nfather's side, too, doesn't it, Olaf?\"\n\nThe colonel laughed. \"Madam Vanity!\" said he, \"I repeat that to be\ndescended of a line of czars or from a house of emperors is, at the\nworst, an empty braggartism, or, at best--upon the plea of heredity--a\nhandy palliation for iniquity; and to be descended of sturdy and honest\nand clean-blooded folk is beyond doubt preferable, since upon quite\nsimilar grounds it entitles one to hope that even now, 'when their\ngeneration is gone, when their play is over, when their panorama is\nwithdrawn in tatters from the stage of the world,' there may yet survive\nof them 'some few actions worth remembering, and a few children who have\nretained some happy stamp from the disposition of their parents.'\"\n\nPatricia--with eyes widened in admiration at his rhetoric,--had turned\nan enticing shade of pink.\n\n\"I am glad of that,\" she said.\n\nShe snuggled so close he could not see her face now. She was to all\nappearances attempting to twist the top-button from his coat.\n\n\"I am very glad that it entitles one to hope--about the\nchildren--Because--\"\n\nThe colonel lifted her a little from him. He did not say anything. But\nhe was regarding her half in wonder and one-half in worship.\n\nShe, too, was silent. Presently she nodded.\n\nHe kissed her as one does a very holy relic.\n\nIt was a moment to look back upon always. There was no period in Rudolph\nMusgrave's life when he could not look back upon this instant and exult\nbecause it had been his.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnly, Patricia found out afterward, with an inexplicable disappointment,\nthat her husband had not been talking extempore, but was freely quoting\nhis \"Compiler's Foreword\" just as it figured in the printed book.\n\nOne judges this posturing, so inevitable of detection, to have been as\nsignificant of much in Rudolph Musgrave as was the fact of its belated\ndiscovery characteristic of Patricia.\n\nYet she had read this book about her family from purely normal motives:\nfirst, to make certain how old her various cousins were; secondly, to\ngloat over any traces of distinction such as her ancestry afforded;\nthirdly, to note with what exaggerated importance the text seemed to\naccredit those relatives she did not esteem, and mentally to annotate\neach page with unprintable events \"which _everybody_ knew about\"; and\nfourthly, to reflect, as with a gush of steadily augmenting love, how\ndear and how unpractical it was of Olaf to have concocted these\ndate-bristling pages--so staunch and blind in his misguided gratitude\ntoward those otherwise uninteresting people who had rendered possible\nthe existence of a Patricia.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nMatters went badly with Patricia in the ensuing months. Her mother's\nblood told here, as Colonel Musgrave saw with disquietude. He knew the\nwomen of his race had by ordinary been unfit for childbearing; indeed,\nthe daughters of this famous house had long, in a grim routine,\nperished, just as Patricia's mother had done, in their first maternal\nessay. There were many hideous histories the colonel could have told you\nof, unmeet to be set down, and he was familiar with this talk of pelvic\nanomalies which were congenital. But he had never thought of Patricia,\ntill this, as being his kinswoman, and in part a Musgrave.\n\nAnd even now the Stapylton blood that was in her pulled Patricia through\nlong weeks of anguish. Surgeons dealt with her very horribly in a famed\nNorthern hospital, whither she had been removed. By her obdurate\nrequest--and secretly, to his own preference, since it was never in his\npower to meet discomfort willingly--Colonel Musgrave had remained in\nLichfield. Patricia knew that officious people would tell him her life\ncould be saved only by the destruction of an unborn boy.\n\nShe never questioned her child would be a boy. She knew that Olaf wanted\na boy.\n\n\"Oh, even more than he does me, daddy. And so he mustn't know, you see,\nuntil it is all over. Because Olaf is such an ill-informed person that\nhe really believes he prefers me.\"\n\n\"Pat,\" her father inconsequently said, \"I'm proud of you! And--and, by\nGod, if I _want_ to cry, I guess I am old enough to know my own mind!\nAnd I'll help you in this if you'll only promise not to die in spite of\nwhat these damn' doctors say, because you're _mine_, Pat, and so you\nrealize a bargain is a bargain.\"\n\n\"Yes--I am really yours, daddy. It is just my crazy body that is a\nMusgrave,\" Patricia explained. \"The real me is an unfortunate Stapylton\nwho has somehow got locked up in the wrong house. It is not a desirable\nresidence, you know, daddy. No modern improvements, for instance. But I\nhave to live in it!... Still, I have not the least intention of dying,\nand I solemnly promise that I won't.\"\n\nSo these two hoodwinked Rudolph Musgrave, and brought it about by\nsubterfuge that his child was born. At most he vaguely understood that\nPatricia was having rather a hard time of it, and steadfastly drugged\nthis knowledge by the performance of trivialities. He was eating a\ncucumber sandwich at the moment young Roger Musgrave came into the\nworld, and by that action very nearly accomplished Patricia's death.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nAnd the gods cursed Roger Stapylton with such a pride in, and so great a\nlove for, his only grandson that the old man could hardly bear to be out\nof the infant's presence. He was frequently in Lichfield nowadays; and\nhe renewed his demands that Rudolph Musgrave give up the\nexhaustively-particularized librarianship, so that \"the little coot\"\nwould be removed to New York and all three of them be with Roger\nStapylton always.\n\nPatricia had not been well since little Roger's birth.\n\nIt was a peaked and shrewish Patricia, rather than Rudolph Musgrave, who\nfought out the long and obstinate battle with Roger Stapylton.\n\nShe was jealous at the bottom of her heart. She would not have anyone,\nnot even her father, be too fond of what was pre\u00ebminently hers; the\nworld at large, including Rudolph Musgrave, was at liberty to adore her\nboy, as was perfectly natural, but not to meddle: and in fine, Patricia\nwas both hysterical and vixenish whenever a giving up of the Library\nwork was suggested.\n\nThe old man did not quarrel with her. And with Roger Stapylton's\nloneliness in these days, and the long thoughts it bred, we have nothing\nhere to do. But when he died, stricken without warning, some five years\nafter Patricia's marriage, his will was discovered to bequeath\npractically his entire fortune to little Roger Musgrave when the child\nshould come of age; and to Rudolph Musgrave, as Patricia's husband, what\nwas a reasonable income when judged by Lichfield's unexacting standards\nrather than by Patricia's anticipations. In a word, Patricia found that\nshe and the colonel could for the future count upon a little more than\nhalf of the income she had previously been allowed by Roger Stapylton.\n\n\"It isn't fair!\" she said. \"It's monstrous! And all because you were so\nobstinate about your picayune Library!\"\n\n\"Patricia--\" he began.\n\n\"Oh, I tell you it's absurd, Olaf! The money logically ought to have\nbeen left to me. And here I will have to come to you for every penny of\n_my_ money. And Heaven knows I have had to scrimp enough to support us\nall on what I used to have--Olaf,\" Patricia said, in another voice,\n\"Olaf! why, what is it, dear?\"\n\n\"I was reflecting,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"that, as you justly observe,\nboth Agatha and I have been practically indebted to you for our support\nthese past five years--\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nIt must be enregistered, not to the man's credit, but rather as a simple\nfact, that it was never within Colonel Musgrave's power to forget the\nincident immediately recorded.\n\nHe forgave; when Patricia wept, seeing how leaden-colored his handsome\nface had turned, he forgave as promptly and as freely as he was learning\nto pardon the telling of a serviceable lie, or the perpetration of an\noccasional barbarism in speech, by Patricia. For he, a Musgrave of\nMatocton, had married a Stapylton; he had begun to comprehend that their\nstandards were different, and that some daily conflict between these\nstandards was inevitable.\n\nAnd besides, as it has been veraciously observed, the truth of an insult\nis the barb which prevents its retraction. Patricia spoke the truth:\nRudolph Musgrave and all those rationally reliant upon Rudolph Musgrave\nfor support, had lived for some five years upon the money which they\nowed to Patricia. He saw about him other scions of old families who\naccepted such circumstances blithely: but, he said, he was a Musgrave\nof Matocton; and, he reflected, in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed\nis necessarily very unhappy.\n\nHe did not mean to touch a penny of such moneys as Roger Stapylton had\nbequeathed to him; for the colonel considered--now--it was a man's duty\npersonally to support his wife and child and sister. And he vigorously\nattempted to discharge this obligation, alike by virtue of his salary at\nthe Library, and by spasmodic raids upon his tiny capital, and--chief of\nall--by speculation in the Stock Market.\n\nOddly enough, his ventures were through a long while--for the most\npart--successful. Here he builded a desperate edifice whose foundations\nwere his social talents; and it was with quaint self-abhorrence he often\nnoted how the telling of a smutty jest or the insistence upon a\nmanifestly superfluous glass of wine had purchased from some properly\ntickled magnate a much desiderated \"tip.\"\n\nAnd presently these tips misled him. So the colonel borrowed from\n\"Patricia's account.\"\n\nAnd on this occasion he guessed correctly.\n\nAnd then he stumbled upon such a chance for reinvestment as does not\noften arrive. And so he borrowed a trifle more in common justice to\nPatricia....\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nWhen those then famous warriors, Colonel Gaynor and Captain Green, were\nobstinately fighting extradition in Quebec; when in Washington the\nSenate was wording a suitable resolution wherewith to congratulate Cuba\nupon that island's brand-new independence; and when Messieurs\nFitzsimmons and Jeffries were making amicable arrangements in San\nFrancisco to fight for the world's championship:--at this remote time,\nin Chicago (on the same day, indeed, that in this very city Mr. S.E.\nGross was legally declared the author of a play called Cyrano de\nBergerac), the Sons of the Colonial Governors opened their tenth\nbiennial convention. You may depend upon it that Colonel Rudolph\nMusgrave represented the Lichfield chapter.\n\nIt was two days later the telegram arrived. It read:\n\n  _Agatha very ill come to me roger in perfect health._\n  PATRICIA.\n\nHe noted how with Stapyltonian thrift Patricia telegraphed ten words\nprecisely....\n\nAnd when he had reached home, late in the evening, the colonel, not\nhaving taken his bunch of keys with him, laid down his dress-suit case\non the dark porch, and reached out one hand to the door-bell. He found\nit muffled with some flimsy, gritty fabric. He did not ring.\n\nUpon the porch was a rustic bench. He sat upon it for a quarter of an\nhour--precisely where he had first talked with Agatha about Patricia's\nfirst coming to Lichfield.... Once the door of a house across the street\nwas opened, with a widening gush of amber light wherein he saw three\nwomen fitting wraps about them. One of them was adjusting a lace scarf\nabove her hair.\n\n\"No, we're not a _bit_ afraid--Just around the corner, you know--_Such_\na pleasant evening----\" Their voices carried far in the still night.\n\nRudolph Musgrave was not thinking of anything. Presently he went around\nthrough the side entrance, and thus came into the kitchen, where the old\nmulattress, Virginia, was sitting alone. The room was very hot.... In\nAgatha's time supper would have been cooked upon the gas-range in the\ncellar, he reflected.... Virginia had risen and made as though to take\nhis dress-suit case, her pleasant yellow face as imperturbable as an\nidol's.\n\n\"No--don't bother, Virginia,\" said Colonel Musgrave.\n\nHe met Patricia in the dining-room, on her way to the kitchen. She had\nnot chosen--as even the most sensible of us will instinctively decline\nto do--to vex the quiet of a house wherein death was by ringing a bell.\n\nHolding his hand in hers, fondling it as she talked, Patricia told how\nthree nights before Miss Agatha had been \"queer, you know,\" at supper.\nPatricia had not liked to leave her, but it was the night of the Woman's\nClub's second Whist Tournament. And Virginia had promised to watch Miss\nAgatha. And, anyhow, Miss Agatha had gone to bed before Patricia left\nthe house, and _anybody_ would have thought she was going to sleep all\nnight. And, in fine, Patricia's return at a drizzling half-past eleven\nhad found Miss Agatha sitting in the garden, in her night-dress only,\nweeping over fancied grievances--and Virginia asleep in the kitchen. And\nAgatha had died that afternoon of pneumonia.\n\nEven in the last half-stupor she was asking always when would Rudolph\ncome? Patricia told him....\n\nRudolph Musgrave did not say anything. Without any apparent emotion he\nput Patricia aside, much as he did the dress-suit case which he had\nforgotten to lay down until Patricia had ended her recital.\n\nHe went upstairs--to the front room, Patricia's bedroom. Patricia\nfollowed him.\n\nAgatha's body lay upon the bed, with a sheet over all. The undertaker's\nskill had arranged everything with smug and horrible tranquillity.\n\nRudolph Musgrave remembered he was forty-six years old; and when in all\nthese years had there been a moment when Agatha--the real Agatha--had\nnot known that what he had done was self-evidently correct, because\notherwise Rudolph would not have done it?\n\n\"I trust you enjoyed your whist-game, Patricia.\"\n\n\"Well, I couldn't help it. I'm not running a sanitarium. I wasn't\nresponsible for her eternal drinking.\"\n\nThe words skipped out of either mouth like gleeful little devils.\n\nThen both were afraid, and both were as icily tranquil as the thing upon\nthe bed. You could not hear anything except the clock upon the mantel.\nColonel Musgrave went to the mantel, opened the clock, and with an odd\ndeliberation removed the pendulum from its hook. Followed one metallic\ngasp, as of indignation, and then silence.\n\nHe spoke, still staring at the clock, his back turned to Patricia. \"You\nmust be utterly worn out. You had better go to bed.\"\n\nHe shifted by the fraction of an inch the old-fashioned \"hand-colored\"\ndaguerreotype of his father in Confederate uniform. \"Please don't wear\nthat black dress again. It is no cause for mourning that we are rid of\nan encumbrance.\"\n\nBehind him, very far away, it seemed, he heard Patricia wailing,\n\"Olaf----!\"\n\nColonel Musgrave turned without any haste. \"Please go,\" he said, and\nappeared to plead with her. \"You must be frightfully tired. I am sorry\nthat I was not here. I seem always to evade my responsibilities,\nsomehow--\"\n\nThen he began to laugh. \"It _is_ rather amusing, after all. Agatha was\nthe most noble person I have ever known. The--this habit of hers to\nwhich you have alluded was not a part of her. And I loved Agatha. And I\nsuppose loving is not altogether dependent upon logic. In any event, I\nloved Agatha. And when I came back to her I had come home,\nsomehow--wherever she might be at the time. That has been true, oh, ever\nsince I can remember--\"\n\nHe touched the dead hand now. \"Please go!\" he said, and he did not look\ntoward Patricia. \"For Agatha loved me better than she did God, you know.\nThe curse was born in her. She had to pay for what those dead,\nsoft-handed Musgraves did. That is why her hands are so cold now. She\nhad to pay for the privilege of being a Musgrave, you see. But then we\ncannot always pick and choose as to what we prefer to be.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course, it is all my fault. Everything is my fault. But God\nknows what would have become of you and your Agatha if it hadn't been\nfor me. Oh! oh!\" Patricia wailed. \"I was a child and I hadn't any better\nsense, and I married you, and you've been living off my money ever\nsince! There hasn't been a Christmas present or a funeral wreath bought\nin this house since I came into it I didn't pick out and pay for out of\nmy own pocket. And all the thanks I get for it is this perpetual\nfault-finding, and I wish I was dead like this poor saint here. She\nspent her life slaving for you. And what thanks did she get for it? Oh,\nyou ought to go down on your knees, Rudolph Musgrave--!\"\n\n\"Please leave,\" he said.\n\n\"I will leave when I feel like it, and not a single minute before, and\nyou might just as well understand as much. You _have_ been living off my\nmoney. Oh, you needn't go to the trouble of lying. And she did too. And\nshe hated me, she always hated me, because I had been fool enough to\nmarry you, and she carried on like a lunatic more than half the time,\nand I always pretended not to notice it, and this is my reward for\ntrying to behave like a lady.\"\n\nPatricia tossed her head. \"Yes, and you needn't look at me as if I were\nsome sort of a bug you hadn't ever seen before and didn't approve of,\nbecause I've seen you try that high-and-mighty trick too often for it to\nwork with me.\"\n\nPatricia stood now beneath the Stuart portrait of young Gerald Musgrave.\nShe had insisted, long ago, that it be hung in her own bedroom--\"because\nit was through that beautiful boy we first got really acquainted, Olaf.\"\nThe boy smiles at you from the canvas, smiles ambiguously, as the\ncolonel now noted.\n\n\"I think you had better go,\" said Colonel Musgrave. \"Please go,\nPatricia, before I murder you.\"\n\nShe saw that he was speaking in perfect earnest.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nRudolph Musgrave sat all night beside the body. He had declined to speak\nwith innumerable sympathetic cousins--Vartreys and Fentons and\nAllardyces and Musgraves, to the fifth and sixth remove--who had come\nfrom all quarters, with visiting-cards and low-voiced requests to be\ninformed \"if there is anything we can possibly do.\"\n\nRudolph Musgrave sat all night beside the body. He had not any strength\nfor anger now, and hardly for grief, Agatha had been his charge; and the\nfact that he had never plucked up courage to allude to her practises was\nnow an enormity in which he could not quite believe. His cowardice and\nits fruitage confronted him, and frightened him into a panic frenzy of\nremorse.\n\nAgatha had been his charge; and he had entrusted the stewardship to\nPatricia. Between them--that Patricia might have her card-game, that he\nmight sit upon a platform for an hour or two with a half-dozen other\npompous fools--they had let Agatha die. There was no mercy in him for\nPatricia or for himself. He wished Patricia had been a man. Had any man\n--an emperor or a coal-heaver, it would not have mattered--spoken as\nPatricia had done within the moment, here, within arm's reach of the\npoor flesh that had been Agatha's, Rudolph Musgrave would have known his\nduty. But, according to his code, it was not permitted to be\ndiscourteous to a woman....\n\nHe caught himself with grotesque meanness wishing that Agatha had been\nthere,--privileged by her sex where he was fettered,--she who was so\ngenerous of heart and so fiery of tongue at need; and comprehension that\nAgatha would never abet or adore him any more smote him anew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd chance reserved for him more poignant torture. Next day, while\nRudolph Musgrave was making out the list of honorary pall-bearers, the\npostman brought a letter which had been forwarded from Chicago. It was\nfrom Agatha, written upon the morning of that day wherein later she had\nbeen, as Patricia phrased it, \"queer, you know.\"\n\nHe found it wildly droll to puzzle out those \"crossed\" four sheets of\ntrivialities written in an Italian hand so minute and orderly that the\nfinished page suggested a fly-screen. He had so often remonstrated with\nAgatha about her penuriousness as concerned stationery.\n\n\"Selina Brice & the Rev'd Henry Anstruther, who now has a church in\nSeattle, have announced their engagement. Stanley Haggage has gone to\nAlabama to marry Leonora Bright, who moved from here a year ago. They\nare both as poor as church mice, & I think marriage in such a case an\nunwise step for anyone. It brings cares & anxieties enough any way,\nwithout starting out with poverty to increase and render deeper every\ntrouble....\"\n\nSuch was the tenor of Agatha's last letter, of the last self-expression\nof that effigy upstairs who (you could see) knew everything and was not\ndiscontent.\n\nHere the dead spoke, omniscient; and told you that Stanley Haggage had\ngone to Alabama, and that marriage brought new cares and anxieties.\n\n\"I cannot laugh,\" said Rudolph Musgrave, aloud. \"I know the jest\ndeserves it. But I cannot laugh, because my upper lip seems to be made\nof leather and I can't move it. And, besides, I loved Agatha to a degree\nwhich only You and I have ever known of. She never understood quite how\nI loved her. Oh, won't You make her understand just how I loved her? For\nAgatha is dead, because You wanted her to be dead, and I have never told\nher how much I loved her, and now I cannot ever tell her how much I\nloved her. Oh, won't You please show me that You have made her\nunderstand? or else have me struck by lightning? or do _anything_....?\"\n\nNothing was done.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nAnd afterward Rudolph Musgrave and his wife met amicably, and without\nreference to their last talk. Patricia wore black-and-white for some six\nmonths, and Colonel Musgrave accepted the compromise tacitly. All passed\nwith perfect smoothness between them; and anyone in Lichfield would have\ntold you that the Musgraves were a model couple.\n\nShe called him \"Rudolph\" now.\n\n\"Olaf is such a silly-sounding nickname for two old married people, you\nknow,\" Patricia estimated.\n\nThe colonel negligently said that he supposed it did sound odd.\n\n\"Only I don't think Clarice Pendomer would care about coming,\" he\nresumed,--for the two were discussing an uncompleted list of the people\nPatricia was to invite to their first house-party.\n\n\"And for heaven's sake, why not? We always have her to everything.\"\n\nHe could not tell her it was because the Charterises were to be among\ntheir guests. So he said: \"Oh, well--!\"\n\n\"Mrs. C.B. Pendomer, then\"--Patricia wrote the name with a flourish.\n\"Oh, you jay-bird, I'm not jealous. Everybody knows you never had any\nmore morals than a tom-cat on the back fence. It's a lucky thing the boy\ndidn't take after you, isn't it? He doesn't, not a bit. No, Harry\nPendomer is the puniest black-haired little wretch, whereas your other\nson, sir, resembles his mother and is in consequence a ravishingly\nbeautiful person of superlative charm--\"\n\nHe was staring at her so oddly that she paused. So Patricia was familiar\nwith that old scandal which linked his name with Clarice Pendomer's! He\nwas wondering if Patricia had married him in the belief that she was\nmarrying a man who, appraised by any standards, had acted infamously.\n\n\"I was only thinking you had better ask Judge Allardyce, Patricia. You\nsee, he is absolutely certain not to come--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis year the Musgraves had decided not to spend the spring alone\ntogether at Matocton, as they had done the four preceding years.\n\n\"It looks so silly,\" as Patricia pointed out.\n\nAnd, besides, a house-party is the most economical method,--as she also\npointed out, being born a Stapylton--of paying off your social\nobligations, because you can always ask so many people who, you know,\nhave made other plans, and cannot accept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"So we will invite Judge Allardyce, of course,\" said Patricia. \"I had\nforgotten his court met in June. Oh, and Peter Blagden too. It had\nslipped my mind his uncle was dead....\"\n\n\"I learned this morning Mrs. Haggage was to lecture in Louisville on the\nsixteenth. She was reading up in the Library, you see--\"\n\n\"Rudolph, you are the lodestar of my existence. I will ask her to come\non the fourteenth and spend a week. I never could abide the hag, but she\nhas such a--There! I've made a big blot right in the middle of\n'darling,' and spoiled a perfectly good sheet of paper!... You'd better\nmail it at once, though, because the evening-paper may have something in\nit about her lecture.\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nRudolph--\"\n\n\"Why--er--yes, dear?\"\n\nThis was after supper, and Patricia was playing solitaire. Her husband\nwas reading the paper.\n\n\"Agatha told me all about Virginia, you know--\"\n\nHere Colonel Musgrave frowned. \"It is not a pleasant topic.\"\n\n\"You jay-bird, you behave entirely too much as if you were my\ngrandfather. As I was saying, Agatha told me all about your uncle and\nVirginia,\" Patricia hurried on. \"And how she ran away afterwards, and\nhid in the woods for three days, and came to your father's plantation,\nand how your father bought her, and how her son was born, and how her\nson was lynched--\"\n\n\"Now, really, Patricia! Surely there are other matters which may be more\nprofitably discussed.\"\n\n\"Of course. Now, for instance, why is the King of Hearts the only one\nthat hasn't a moustache?\" Patricia peeped to see what cards lay beneath\nthat monarch, and upon reflection moved the King of Spades into the\nvacant space. She was a devotee of solitaire and invariably cheated at\nit.\n\nShe went on, absently: \"But don't you see? That colored boy was your own\nfirst cousin, and he was killed for doing exactly what his father had\ndone. Only they sent the father to the Senate and gave him columns of\nflubdub and laid him out in state when he died--and they poured kerosene\nupon the son and burned him alive. And I believe Virginia thinks that\nwasn't fair.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I honestly believe Virginia hates the Musgraves. She is only a negro,\nof course, but then she was a mother once--Oh, yes! all I need is a\nblack eight--\" Patricia demanded, \"Now look at your brother Hector--the\nawfully dissipated one that died of an overdose of opiates. When it\nhappened wasn't Virginia taking care of him?\"\n\n\"Of course. She is an invaluable nurse.\"\n\n\"And nobody else was here when Agatha went out into the rain. Now, what\nif she had just let Agatha go, without trying to stop her? It would have\nbeen perfectly simple. So is this. All I have to do is to take them off\nnow.\"\n\nColonel Musgrave negligently returned to his perusal of the afternoon\npaper. \"You are suggesting--if you will overlook my frankness--the most\ndeplorable sort of nonsense, Patricia.\"\n\n\"I know exactly how Balaam felt,\" she said, irrelevantly, and fell to\nshuffling the cards. \"You don't, and you won't, understand that Virginia\nis a human being. In any event, I wish you would get rid of her.\"\n\n\"I couldn't decently do that,\" said Rudolph Musgrave, with careful\npatience. \"Virginia's faithfulness has been proven by too many years of\nfaithful service. Nothing more strikingly attests the folly of freeing\nthe negro than the unwillingness of the better class of slaves to leave\ntheir former owners--\"\n\n\"Now you are going to quote a paragraph or so from your Gracious Era. As\nif I hadn't read everything you ever wrote! You are a fearful humbug in\nsome ways, Rudolph.\"\n\n\"And you are a red-headed rattlepate, madam. But seriously, Patricia,\nyou who were reared in the North are strangely unwilling to concede that\nwe of the South are after all best qualified to deal with the Negro\nProblem. We know the negro as you cannot ever know him.\"\n\n\"You! Oh, God ha' mercy on us!\" mocked Patricia. \"There wasn't any Negro\nProblem hereabouts, you beautiful idiot, so long as there were any\nnegroes. Why, to-day there is hardly one full-blooded negro in\nLichfield. There are only a thousand or so of mulattoes who share the\nblood of people like your Uncle Edward. And for the most part they take\nafter their white kin, unfortunately. And there you have the Lichfield\nNegro Problem in a nutshell. It is a venerable one and fully set forth\nin the Bible. You needn't attempt to argue with me, because you are a\nninnyhammer, and I am a second Nestor. The Holy Scriptures are perfectly\nexplicit as to what happens to the heads of the children and their teeth\ntoo.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't jest about such matters--\"\n\n\"Because it isn't lady-like? But, Rudolph, you know perfectly well that\nI am not a lady.\"\n\n\"My dear!\" he cried, in horror that was real, \"and what on earth have I\nsaid even to suggest--\"\n\n\"Oh, not a syllable; it isn't at all the sort of thing that your sort\n_says_ ... And I am not your sort. I don't know that I altogether wish I\nwere. But _if_ I were, it would certainly make things easier,\" Patricia\nadded sharply.\n\n\"My dear--!\" he again protested.\n\n\"Now, candidly, Rudolph\"--relinquishing the game, she fell to shuffling\nthe cards--\"just count up the number of times this month that my--oh,\nwell! I really don't know what to call it except my deplorable omission\nin failing to be born a lady--has seemed to you to yank the very last\nrag off the gooseberry-bush?\"\n\nHe scoffed. \"What nonsense! Although, of course, Patricia--\"\n\nShe nodded, mischief in her brightly-colored tiny face. \"Yes, that is\njust your attitude, you beautiful idiot.\"\n\n\"--although, of course--now, quite honestly, Patricia, I have\noccasionally wished that you would not speak of sacred and--er,\nphysical and sociological matters in exactly the tone in which--well! in\nwhich you sometimes do speak of them. It may sound old-fashioned, but I\nhave always believed that decency is quite as important in mental\naffairs as it is in physical ones, and that as a consequence, a\ngentlewoman should always clothe her thoughts with at least the same\ncare she accords her body. Oh, don't misunderstand me! Of course it\ndoesn't do any harm, my dear, between us. But outside--you see, for\npeople to know that you think about such things must necessarily give\nthem a false opinion of you.\"\n\nPatricia meditated.\n\nShe said, with utter solemnity, \"Anathema maranatha! oh, hell to damn!\nmay the noses of all respectable people be turned upside down and\njackasses dance eternally upon their grandmothers' graves!\"\n\n\"Patricia--!\" cried a shocked colonel.\n\n\"I mean every syllable of it. No, Rudolph; _I_ can't help it if the\nvinaigretted beauties of your boyhood were unabridged dictionaries of\nprudery. You see, I know almost all the swearwords there are. And I read\nthe newspapers, and medical books, and even the things that boys chalk\nup on fences. In consequence I am not a bit whiteminded, because if you\nuse your mind at all it gets more or less dingy, just like using\nanything else.\"\n\nHe could not help but laugh, much as he disapproved. Patricia fluttered\nand, as a wren might have done, perched presently upon his knee.\n\n\"Rudolph, can't you laugh more often, and not devote so much time to\ntracing out the genealogies of those silly people, and being so\ntediously beautiful and good?\" she asked, and with a hint of\nseriousness. \"Rudolph, you don't know how I would adore you if you would\nrob a church or cut somebody's throat in an alley, and tell me all about\nit because you knew I wouldn't betray you. You are so infernally\nrespectable in everything you do! How did you come to bully me that day\nat the Library? It seems almost as if those two were different people...\ndoesn't it, Rudolph?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" the colonel said whimsically, \"I am afraid we are rather like\nthe shepherdess and the chimney-sweep of the fable I read you very long\nago. We climbed up so far that we could see the stars, once, very long\nago, Patricia, and we have come back to live upon the parlor table. I\nsuppose it happens to all the little china people.\"\n\nShe took his meaning. Each was aware of an odd sense of intimacy.\n\"Everything we have to be glad for now, Rudolph, is the rivet in\ngrandfather's neck. It is rather a fiasco, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Eh, there are all sorts of rivets, Patricia. And the thing one cannot\ndo because one is what one is, need not be necessarily a cause for\ngrief.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nIt was excellent to see Jack Charteris again, as Colonel Musgrave did\nwithin a few days of this. Musgrave was unreasonably fond of the\nnovelist and frankly confessed it would be as preposterous to connect\nCharteris with any of the accepted standards of morality as it would be\nto judge an artesian-well from the standpoint of ethics.\n\nAnne was not yet in Lichfield. She had broken the journey to visit a\nmaternal grand-aunt and some Virginia cousins, in Richmond, Charteris\nexplained, and was to come thence to Matocton.\n\n\"And so you have acquired a boy and, by my soul, a very handsome wife,\nRudolph?\"\n\n\"It is sufficiently notorious,\" said Colonel Musgrave. \"Yes, we are\nquite absurdly happy.\" He laughed and added: \"Patricia--but you don't\nknow her droll way of putting things--says that the only rational\ncomplaint I can advance against her is her habit of rushing into a\nhospital every month or so and having a section or two of her person\nremoved by surgeons. It worries me,--only, of course, it is not the\nsort of thing you can talk about. And, as Patricia says, it _is_ an\nunpleasant thing to realize that your wife is not leaving you through\nthe ordinary channels of death or of type-written decrees of the court,\nbut only in vulgar fractions, as it were--\"\n\n\"Please don't be quite so brutal, Rudolph. It is not becoming in a\nMusgrave of Matocton to speak of women in any tone other than the most\nhoneyed accents of chivalry.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was only quoting Patricia,\" the colonel largely said,\n\"and--er--Jack,\" he continued. \"By the way, Jack, Clarice Pendomer will\nbe at Matocton--\"\n\n\"I rejoice in her good luck,\" said Charteris, equably.\n\n\"--and--well! I was wondering--?\"\n\n\"I can assure you that there will be no--trouble. That skeleton is\nsafely locked in its closet, and the key to that closet is missing--more\nthanks to you. You acted very nobly in the whole affair, Rudolph. I wish\nI could do things like that. As it is, of course, I shall always detest\nyou for having been able to do it.\"\n\nCharteris said, thereafter: \"I shall always envy you, though, Rudolph.\nNo other man I know has ever attained the good old troubadourish ideal\nof _domnei_--that love which rather abhors than otherwise the notion of\npossessing its object. I still believe it was a distinct relief to a\ncertain military officer, whose name we need not mention, when Anne\ndecided not to marry you.\"\n\nThe colonel grinned, a trifle consciously. \"Well, Anne meant youth, you\ncomprehend, and all the things we then believed in, Jack. It would have\nbeen decidedly difficult to live up to such a contract, and--as it\nwere--to fulfil every one of the implied specifications!\"\n\n\"And yet\"--here Charteris flicked his cigarette--\"Anne ruled in the\nstead of Aline Van Orden. And Aline, in turn, had followed Clarice\nPendomer. And before the coming of Clarice had Pauline Romeyne, whom\ntime has converted into Polly Ashmeade, reigned in the land--\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass!\" the colonel pleaded; and then observed,\ninconsequently: \"I can't somehow quite realize Aline is dead. Lord,\nLord, the letters that I wrote to her! She sent them all back, you know,\nin genuine romantic fashion, after we had quarreled. I found those\nboyish ravings only the other day in my father's desk at Matocton, and\nskimmed them over. I shall read them through some day and appropriately\nmeditate over life's mysteries that are too sad for tears.\"\n\nHe meditated now.\n\n\"It wouldn't be quite equitable, Jack,\" the colonel summed it up, \"if\nthe Aline I loved--no, I don't mean the real woman, the one you and all\nthe other people knew, the one that married the enterprising brewer and\ndied five years ago--were not waiting for me somewhere. I can't express\njust what I mean, but you will understand, I know--?\"\n\n\"That heaven is necessarily run on a Mohammedan basis? Why, of course,\"\nsaid Mr. Charteris. \"Heaven, as I apprehend it, is a place where we\nshall live eternally among those ladies of old years who never\ncondescended actually to inhabit any realm more tangible than that of\nour boyish fancies. It is the obvious definition; and I defy you to\nevolve a more enticing allurement toward becoming a deacon.\"\n\n\"You romancers are privileged to talk nonsense anywhere,\" the colonel\nestimated, \"and I suppose that in the Lichfield you have made famous,\nJack, you have a double right.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I never wrote a line concerning Lichfield. I only wrote about\nthe Lichfield whose existence you continue to believe in, in spite of\nthe fact that you are actually living in the real Lichfield,\" Charteris\nreturned. \"The vitality of the legend is wonderful.\"\n\nHe cocked his head to one side--an habitual gesture with Charteris--and\nthe colonel noted, as he had often done before, how extraordinarily\nreminiscent Jack was of a dried-up, quizzical black parrot. Said\nCharteris:\n\n\"I love to serve that legend. I love to prattle of 'ole Marster' and\n'ole Miss,' and throw in a sprinkling of 'mockin'-buds' and 'hants' and\n'horg-killing time,' and of sweeping animadversions as to all 'free\nniggers'; and to narrate how 'de quality use ter cum'--you spell it\nc-u-m because that looks so convincingly like dialect--'ter de gret\nhous.' Those are the main ingredients. And, as for the unavoidable\nlove-interest--\" Charteris paused, grinned, and pleasantly resumed:\n\"Why, jes arter dat, suh, a hut Yankee cap'en, whar some uv our folks\ndone shoot in de laig, wuz lef on de road fer daid--a quite notorious\ncustom on the part of all Northern armies--un Young Miss had him fotch\nup ter de gret hous, un nuss im same's he one uv de fambly, un dem two\njes fit un argufy scanlous un never spicion huccum dey's in love wid\neach othuh till de War's ovuh. And there you are! I need not mention\nthat during the tale's progress it is necessary to introduce at least\none favorable mention of Lincoln, arrange a duel 'in de low grouns'\nimmediately after day-break, and have the family silver interred in the\nback garden, because these points will naturally suggest themselves.\"\n\n\"Jack, Jack!\" the colonel cried, \"it is an ill bird that fouls its own\nnest.\"\n\n\"But, believe me, I don't at heart,\" said Charteris, in a queer earnest\nvoice. \"There is a sardonic imp inside me that makes me jeer at the\ncommoner tricks of the trade--and yet when I am practising that trade,\nwhen I am writing of those tender-hearted, brave and gracious men and\nwomen, and of those dear old darkies, I very often write with tears in\nmy eyes. I tell you this with careful airiness because it is true and\nbecause it would embarrass me so horribly if you believed it.\"\n\nThen he was off upon another tack. \"And wherein, pray, have I harmed\nLichfield by imagining a dream city situated half way between Atlantis\nand Avalon and peopled with superhuman persons--and by having called\nthis city Lichfield? The portrait did not only flatter Lichfield, it\nflattered human nature. So, naturally, it pleased everybody. Yes, that,\nI take it, is the true secret of romance--to induce the momentary\ndelusion that humanity is a superhuman race, profuse in aspiration, and\nprodigal in the exercise of glorious virtues and stupendous vices. As a\nmatter of fact, all human passions are depressingly chicken-hearted, I\nfind. Were it not for the police court records, I would pessimistically\ninsist that all of us elect to love one person and to hate another with\nvery much the same enthusiasm that we display in expressing a preference\nfor rare roast beef as compared with the outside slice. Oh, really,\nRudolph, you have no notion how salutary it is to the self-esteem of us\nromanticists to run across, even nowadays, an occasional breach of the\npeace. For then sometimes--when the coachman obligingly cuts the\nbutler's throat in the back-alley, say--we actually presume to think for\na moment that our profession is almost as honest as that of making\ncounterfeit money....\"\n\nThe colonel did not interrupt his brief pause of meditation. Then the\nnovelist said:\n\n\"Why, no; if I were ever really to attempt a tale of Lichfield, I would\nnot write a romance but a tragedy. I think that I would call my tragedy\n_Futility_, for it would mirror the life of Lichfield with unengaging\ncandor; and, as a consequence, people would complain that my tragedy\nlacked sustained interest, and that its participants were inconsistent;\nthat it had no ordered plot, no startling incidents, no high endeavors,\nand no especial aim; and that it was equally deficient in all\ntime-hallowed provocatives of either laughter or tears. For very few\npeople would understand that a life such as this, when rightly viewed,\nis the most pathetic tragedy conceivable.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, now, Jack! come, recollect that your reasoning powers are\nalmost as worthy of employment as your rhetorical abilities! We are not\nquite so bad as that, you know. We may be a little behind the times in\nLichfield; we certainly let well enough alone, and we take things pretty\nmuch as they come; but we meddle with nobody, and, after all, we don't\ndo any especial harm.\"\n\n\"We don't do anything whatever in especial, Rudolph. That would be\nprecisely the theme of my story of the real Lichfield if I were ever\nbold enough to write it. There seems to be a sort of blight upon\nLichfield. Oh, yes! it would be unfair, perhaps, to contrast it with the\nbigger Southern cities, like Richmond and Atlanta and New Orleans; but\neven the inhabitants of smaller Southern towns are beginning to buy\nexcursion tickets, and thereby ascertain that the twentieth century has\nreally begun. Yes, it is only in Lichfield I can detect the raw stuff of\na genuine tragedy; for, depend upon it, Rudolph, the most pathetic\ntragedy in life is to get nothing in particular out of it.\"\n\n\"But, for my part, I don't see what you are driving at,\" the colonel\nstoutly said.\n\nAnd Charteris only laughed. \"And I hardly expected you to do so,\nRudolph--or not yet, at least.\"\n\n\n\n\nPART FIVE - SOUVENIR\n\n  \"I am contented by remembrances--\n  Dreams of dead passions, wraiths of vanished times,\n  Fragments of vows, and by-ends of old rhymes--\n  Flotsam and jetsam tumbling in the seas\n  Whereon, long since, put forth our argosies\n  Which, bent on traffic in the Isles of Love,\n  Lie foundered somewhere in some firth thereof,\n  Encradled by eternal silences.\"\n\n  \"Thus, having come to naked bankruptcy,\n  Let us part friends, as thrifty tradesmen do\n  When common ventures fail, for it may be\n  These battered oaths and rhymes may yet ring true\n  To some fair woman's hearing, so that she\n  Will listen and think of love, and I of you.\"\n\nF. Ashcroft Wheeler. _Revisions_.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nWhen the _Reliance_, the _Constitution_ and the _Columbia_ were holding\ntrial races off Newport to decide which one of these yachts should\ndefend the _America's_ cup; when the tone of the Japanese press as to\nRussia's actions in Manchuria was beginning to grow ominous; when the\nJews of America were drafting a petition to the Czar; and when it was\nrumored that the health of Pope Leo XIII was commencing to fail:--at\nthis remote time, the Musgraves gave their first house-party.\n\nAnd at this period Colonel Musgrave noted and admired the apparent\nunconcern with which John Charteris and Clarice Pendomer encountered at\nMatocton. And at this period Colonel Musgrave noted with approval the\nintimacy which was, obviously, flourishing between the little novelist\nand Patricia.\n\nAlso Colonel Musgrave had presently good reason to lament a contretemps,\nover which he was sulking when Mrs. Pendomer rustled to her seat at the\nbreakfast-table, with a shortness of breath that was partly due to the\nstairs, and in part attributable to her youthful dress, which fitted a\ntrifle too perfectly.\n\n\"Waffles?\" said Mrs. Pendomer. \"At my age and weight the first is an\nexperiment and the fifth an amiable indiscretion of which I am\ninvariably guilty. Sugar, please.\" She yawned, and reached a\ngenerously-proportioned arm toward the sugar-bowl. \"Yes, that will do,\nPilkins.\"\n\nColonel Musgrave--since the remainder of his house-party had already\nbreakfasted--raised his fine eyes toward the chandelier, and sighed, as\nPilkins demurely closed the dining-room door.\n\nLeander Pilkins--butler for a long while now to the Musgraves of\nMatocton--would here, if space permitted, be the subject of an encomium.\nLeander Pilkins was in Lichfield considered to be, upon the whole, the\nhandsomest man whom Lichfield had produced; for this quadroon's skin was\nlike old ivory, and his profile would have done credit to an emperor.\nHis terrapin is still spoken of in Lichfield as people in less favored\nlocalities speak of the Golden Age, and his mayonnaise (boasts\nLichfield) would have compelled an Olympian to plead for a second\nhelping. For the rest, his deportment in all functions of butlership is\nbest described as super-Chesterfieldian; and, indeed, he was generally\nknown to be a byblow of Captain Beverley Musgrave's, who in his day was\nLichfield's arbiter as touched the social graces. And so, no more of\nPilkins.\n\nMrs. Pendomer partook of chops. \"Is this remorse,\" she queried, \"or a\nconvivially induced requirement for bromides? At this unearthly hour of\nthe morning it is very often difficult to disentangle the two.\"\n\n\"It is neither,\" said Colonel Musgrave, and almost snappishly.\n\nFollowed an interval of silence. \"Really,\" said Mrs. Pendomer, and as\nwith sympathy, \"one would think you had at last been confronted with one\nof your thirty-seven pasts--or is it thirty-eight, Rudolph?\"\n\nColonel Musgrave frowned disapprovingly at her frivolity; he swallowed\nhis coffee, and buttered a superfluous potato. \"H'm!\" said he; \"then you\nknow?\"\n\n\"I know,\" sighed she, \"that a sleeping past frequently suffers from\ninsomnia.\"\n\n\"And in that case,\" said he, darkly, \"it is not the only sufferer.\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer considered the attractions of a third waffle--a mellow\nblending of autumnal yellows, fringed with a crisp and irresistible\nbrown, that, for the moment, put to flight all dreams and visions of\nslenderness.\n\n\"And Patricia?\" she queried, with a mental hiatus.\n\nColonel Musgrave flushed.\n\n\"Patricia,\" he conceded, with mingled dignity and sadness, \"is, after\nall, still in her twenties----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pendomer, with a dryness which might mean anything or\nnothing; \"she _was_ only twenty-one when she married you.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" he explained, with obvious patience, \"that at her age she--not\nunnaturally--takes an immature view of things. Her unspoiled purity,\"\nhe added, meditatively, \"and innocence and general unsophistication are,\nof course, adorable, but I can admit to thinking that for a journey\nthrough life they impress me as excess baggage.\"\n\n\"Patricia,\" said Mrs. Pendomer, soothingly, \"has ideals. And ideals,\nlike a hare-lip or a mission in life, should be pitied rather than\ncondemned, when our friends possess them; especially,\" she continued,\nbuttering her waffle, \"as so many women have them sandwiched between\ntheir last attack of measles and their first imported complexion. No one\nof the three is lasting, Rudolph.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said he.\n\nThere was another silence. The colonel desperately felt that matters\nwere not advancing.\n\n\"H'm!\" said she, with something of interrogation in her voice.\n\n\"See here, Clarice, I have known you----\"\n\n\"You have not!\" cried she, very earnestly; \"not by five years!\"\n\n\"Well, say for some time. You are a sensible woman----\"\n\n\"A man,\" Mrs. Pendomer lamented, parenthetically, \"never suspects a\nwoman of discretion, until she begins to lose her waist.\"\n\n\"--and I am sure that I can rely upon your womanly tact, and finer\ninstincts,--and that sort of thing, you know--to help me out of a deuce\nof a mess.\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer ate on, in an exceedingly noncommittal fashion, as he\npaused, inquiringly.\n\n\"She has been reading some letters,\" said he, at length; \"some letters\nthat I wrote a long time ago.\"\n\n\"In the case of so young a girl,\" observed Mrs. Pendomer, with perfect\ncomprehension, \"I should have undoubtedly recommended a judicious\nsupervision of her reading-matter.\"\n\n\"She was looking through an old escritoire,\" he explained; \"Jack\nCharteris had suggested that some of my father's letters--during the\nWar, you know--. might be of value--\"\n\nHe paused, for Mrs. Pendomer appeared on the verge of a question.\n\nBut she only said, \"So it was Mr. Charteris who suggested Patricia's\nsearching the desk. Ah, yes! And then--?\"\n\n\"And it was years ago--and just the usual sort of thing, though it may\nhave seemed from the letters--Why, I hadn't given the girl a thought,\"\nhe cried, in virtuous indignation, \"until Patricia found the\nletters--and read them!\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" she assented--\"yes,--just as I read George's.\"\n\nThe smile with which she accompanied this remark, suggested that both\nMr. Pendomer's correspondence and home life were at times of an\ninteresting nature.\n\n\"I had destroyed the envelopes when she returned them,\" continued\nColonel Musgrave, with morose confusion of persons. \"Patricia doesn't\neven know who the girl was--her name, somehow, was not mentioned.\"\n\n\"'Woman of my heart'--'Dearest girl in all the world,'\" quoted Mrs.\nPendomer, reminiscently, \"and suchlike tender phrases, scattered in with\na pepper-cruet, after the rough copy was made in pencil, and dated just\n'Wednesday,' or 'Thursday,' of course. Ah, you were always very careful,\nRudolph,\" she sighed; \"and now that makes it all the worse, because--as\nfar as all the evidence goes--these letters may have been returned\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Why--!\" Colonel Musgrave pulled up short, hardly seeing his way clear\nthrough the indignant periods on which he had entered. \"I declined,\"\nsaid he, somewhat lamely, \"to discuss the matter with her, in her\npresent excited and perfectly unreasonable condition.\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer's penciled eyebrows rose, and her lips--which were quite\nas red as there was any necessity for their being--twitched.\n\n\"Hysterics?\" she asked.\n\n\"Worse!\" groaned Colonel Musgrave; \"patient resignation under unmerited\naffliction!\"\n\nHe had picked up a teaspoon, and he carefully balanced it upon his\nforefinger.\n\n\"There were certain phrases in these letters which were, somehow,\nrepeated in certain letters I wrote to Patricia the summer we were\nengaged, and--not to put too fine a point upon it--she doesn't like it.\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer smiled, as though she considered this not improbable; and\nhe continued, with growing embarrassment and indignation:\n\n\"She says there must have been others\"--Mrs. Pendomer's smile grew\nreminiscent--\"any number of others; that she is only an incident in my\nlife. Er--as you have mentioned, Patricia has certain notions--Northern\nidiocies about the awfulness of a young fellow's sowing his wild oats,\nwhich you and I know perfectly well he is going to do, anyhow, if he is\nworth his salt. But she doesn't know it, poor little girl. So she won't\nlisten to reason, and she won't come downstairs--which,\" lamented\nRudolph Musgrave, plaintively, \"is particularly awkward in a\nhouse-party.\"\n\nHe drummed his fingers, for a moment, on the table.\n\n\"It is,\" he summed up, \"a combination of Ibsen and hysterics, and\nof--er, rather declamatory observations concerning there being one law\nfor the man and another for the woman, and Patricia's realization of the\nmistake we both made--and all that sort of nonsense, you know, exactly\nas if, I give you my word, she were one of those women who want to\nvote.\" The colonel, patently, considered that feminine outrageousness\ncould go no farther. \"And she is taking menthol and green tea and\nmustard plasters and I don't know what all, in bed, prior to--to----\"\n\n\"Taking leave?\" Mrs. Pendomer suggested.\n\n\"Er--that was mentioned, I believe,\" said Colonel Musgrave. \"But of\ncourse she was only talking.\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer looked about her; and, without, the clean-shaven lawns\nand trim box-hedges were very beautiful in the morning sunlight; within,\nthe same sunlight sparkled over the heavy breakfast service, and gleamed\nin the high walnut panels of the breakfast-room. She viewed the\ncomfortable appointments about her a little wistfully, for Mrs.\nPendomer's purse was not over-full.\n\n\"Of course,\" said she, as in meditation, \"there was the money.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rudolph Musgrave, slowly; \"there was the money.\"\n\nHe sprang to his feet, and drew himself erect. Here was a moment he must\ngive its full dramatic value.\n\n\"Oh, no, Clarice, my marriage may have been an eminently sensible one,\nbut I love my wife. Oh, believe me, I love her very tenderly, poor\nlittle Patricia! I have weathered some forty-seven birthdays; and I have\ndone much as other men do, and all that--there have been flirtations and\nsuchlike, and--er--some women have been kinder to me than I deserved.\nBut I love her; and there has not been a moment since she came into my\nlife I haven't loved her, and been--\" he waved his hands now impotently,\nalmost theatrically--\"sickened at the thought of the others.\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer's foot tapped the floor whilst he spoke. When he had made\nan ending, she inclined her head toward him.\n\n\"Thank you!\" said Mrs. Pendomer.\n\nColonel Musgrave bit his lip; and he flushed.\n\n\"That,\" said he, hastily, \"was different.\"\n\nBut the difference, whatever may have been its nature, was seemingly a\nmatter of unimportance to Mrs. Pendomer, who was in meditation. She\nrested her ample chin on a much-bejeweled hand for a moment; and, when\nMrs. Pendomer raised her face, her voice was free from affectation.\n\n\"You will probably never understand that this particular July day is a\ncrucial point in your life. You will probably remember it, if you\nremember it at all, simply as that morning when Patricia found some\ngirl-or-another's old letters, and behaved rather unreasonably about\nthem. It was the merest trifle, you will think.... John Charteris\nunderstands women better than you do, Rudolph.\"\n\n\"I need not pretend at this late day to be as clever as Jack,\" the\ncolonel said, in some bewilderment. \"But why not more succinctly state\nthat the Escurial is not a dromedary, although there are many flies in\nFrance? For what on earth has Jack to do with crucial points and July\nmornings?\"\n\n\"Why, I suppose, I only made bold to introduce his name for the sake of\nan illustration, Rudolph. For the last person in the world to realize,\nprecisely, why any woman did anything is invariably the woman who did\nit.... Yet there comes in every married woman's existence that time when\nshe realizes, suddenly, that her husband has a past which might be\ntaken as, in itself, a complete and rounded life--as a life which had\nrun the gamut of all ordinary human passions, and had become familiar\nwith all ordinary human passions a dishearteningly long while before she\never came into that life. A woman never realizes that of her lover,\nsomehow. But to know that your husband, the father of your child, has\nlived for other women a life in which you had no part, and never can\nhave part!--she realizes that, at one time or another, and--and it\nsickens her.\" Mrs. Pendomer smiled as she echoed his phrase, but her\neyes were not mirthful.\n\n\"Ah, she hungers for those dead years, Rudolph, and, though you devote\nyour whole remaining life to her, nothing can ever make up for them; and\nshe always hates those shadowy women who have stolen them from her. A\nwoman never, at heart, forgives the other women who have loved her\nhusband, even though she cease to care for him herself. For she\nremembers--ah, you men forget so easily, Rudolph! God had not invented\nmemory when he created Adam; it was kept for the woman.\"\n\nThen ensued a pause, during which Rudolph Musgrave smiled down upon her,\nirresolutely; for he abhorred \"a scene,\" as his vernacular phrased it,\nand to him Clarice's present manner bordered upon both the scenic and\nthe incomprehensible.\n\n\"Ah!--you women!\" he temporized.\n\nThere was a glance from eyes whose luster time and irregular living had\nconspired to dim.\n\n\"Ah!--you men!\" Mrs. Pendomer retorted. \"And there we have the tragedy\nof life in a nutshell!\"\n\nSilence lasted for a while. The colonel was finding this matutinal talk\ndiscomfortably opulent in pauses.\n\n\"Rudolph, and has it never occurred to you that in marrying Patricia you\nswindled her?\"\n\nAnd naturally his eyebrows lifted.\n\n\"Because a woman wants love.\"\n\n\"Well, well! and don't I love Patricia?\"\n\n\"I dare say that you think you do. Only you have played at loving so\nlong you are really unable to love anybody as a girl has every right to\nbe loved in her twenties. Yes, Rudolph, you are being rather subtly\npunished for the good times you have had. And, after all, the saddest\npunishment is something that happens in us, not something which happens\nto us.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't laugh, Clarice----\"\n\n\"I wish I didn't have to. For I would get far more comfort out of\ncrying, and I don't dare to, because of my complexion. It comes in a\nround pasteboard box nowadays, you know, Rudolph, with French\nmendacities all over the top--and my eyebrows come in a fat crayon, and\nthe healthful glow of my lips comes in a little porcelain tub.\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer was playing with a teaspoon now, and a smile hovered about\nthe aforementioned lips.\n\n\"And yet, do you remember, Rudolph,\" said she, \"that evening at\nAssequin, when I wore a blue gown, and they were playing _Fleurs\nd'Amour_, and--you said--?\"\n\n\"Yes\"--there was an effective little catch in his voice--\"you were a\nwonderful girl, Clarice--'my sunshine girl,' I used to call you. And\nblue was always your color; it went with your eyes so exactly. And those\nbig sleeves they wore then--those tell-tale, crushable sleeves!--they\nsuited your slender youthfulness so perfectly! Ah, I remember it as\nthough it were yesterday!\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer majestically rose to her feet.\n\n\"It was pink! And it was at the Whitebrier you said--what you said!\nAnd--and you don't deserve anything but what you are getting,\" she\nconcluded, grimly.\n\n\"I--it was so long ago,\" Rudolph Musgrave apologized, with mingled\ndiscomfort and vagueness.\n\n\"Yes,\" she conceded, rather sadly; \"it was so long--oh, very long ago!\nFor we were young then, and we believed in things, and--and Jack\nCharteris had not taken a fancy to me--\" She sighed and drummed her\nfingers on the table. \"But women have always helped and shielded you,\nhaven't they, Rudolph? And now I am going to help you too, for you have\nshown me the way. You don't deserve it in the least, but I'll do it.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThus it shortly came about that Mrs. Pendomer mounted, in meditative\nmood, to Mrs. Musgrave's rooms; and that Mrs. Pendomer, recovering her\nbreath, entered, without knocking, into a gloom where cologne and\nmenthol and the odor of warm rubber contended for mastery. For Patricia\nhad decided that she was very ill indeed, and was sobbing softly in bed.\n\nVery calmly, Mrs. Pendomer opened a window, letting in a flood of fresh\nair and sunshine; very calmly, she drew a chair--a substantial\narm-chair--to the bedside, and, very calmly, she began:\n\n\"My dear, Rudolph has told me of this ridiculous affair, and--oh, you\nequally ridiculous girl!\"\n\nShe removed, with deft fingers, a damp and clinging bandage from about\nPatricia's head, and patted the back of Patricia's hand, placidly.\nPatricia was by this time sitting erect in bed, and her coppery hair was\nthick about her face, which was colorless; and, altogether, she was very\nrigid and very indignant and very pretty, and very, very young.\n\n\"How dare he tell you--or anybody else!\" she cried.\n\n\"We are such old friends, remember,\" Mrs. Pendomer pleaded, and\nrearranged the pillows, soothingly, about her hostess; \"and I want to\ntalk to you quietly and sensibly.\"\n\nPatricia sank back among the pillows, and inhaled the fresh air, which,\nin spite of herself, she found agreeable. \"I--somehow, I don't feel very\nsensible,\" she murmured, half sulky and half shame-faced.\n\nMrs. Pendomer hesitated for a moment, and then plunged into the heart of\nthings. \"You are a woman, dear,\" she said, gently, \"though heaven knows\nit must have been only yesterday you were playing about the nursery--and\none of the facts we women must face, eventually, is that man is a\npolygamous animal. It is unfortunate, perhaps, but it is true.\nCivilization may veneer the fact, but nothing will ever override it, not\neven in these new horseless carriages. A man may give his wife the best\nthat is in him--his love, his trust, his life's work--but it is only the\nbest there is left. We give our hearts; men dole out theirs, as people\nfeed bread to birds, with a crumb for everyone. His wife has the\nremnant. And the best we women can do is to remember we are credibly\ninformed that half a loaf is preferable to no bread at all.\"\n\nHer face sobered, and she added, pensively: \"We might contrive a better\nuniverse, we sister women, but this is not permitted us. So we must take\nit as it is.\"\n\nPatricia stirred, as talking died away. \"I don't believe it,\" said she;\nand she added, with emphasis: \"And, anyhow, I hate that nasty trollop!\"\n\n\"Ah, but you do believe it.\" Mrs. Pendomer's voice was insistent. \"You\nknew it years before you went into long frocks. That knowledge is, I\nsuppose, a legacy from our mothers.\"\n\nPatricia frowned, petulantly, and then burst into choking sobs. \"Oh!\"\nshe cried, \"it's damnable! Some other woman has had what I can never\nhave. And I wanted it so!--that first love that means everything--the\nlove he gave her when I was only a messy little girl, with pig-tails and\ntoo many hands and feet! Oh, that--that hell-cat! She's had everything!\"\n\nThere was an interval, during which Mrs. Pendomer smiled crookedly, and\nPatricia continued to sob, although at lengthening intervals. Then, Mrs.\nPendomer lifted the packet of letters lying on the bed, and cleared her\nthroat.\n\n\"H'm!\" said she; \"so this is what caused all the trouble? You don't\nmind?\"\n\nAnd, considering silence as equivalent to acquiescence, she drew out a\nletter at hazard, and read aloud:\n\n\"'Just a line, woman of all the world, to tell you ... but what have I\nto tell you, after all? Only the old, old message, so often told that it\nseems scarcely worth while to bother the postman about it. Just three\nwords that innumerable dead lips have whispered, while life was yet good\nand old people were unreasonable and skies were blue--three words that\nour unborn children's children will whisper to one another when we too\nhave gone to help the grasses in their growing or to nourish the\nvictorious, swaying hosts of some field of daffodils. Just three\nwords--that is my message to you, my lady.... Ah, it is weary waiting\nfor a sight of your dear face through these long days that are so much\nalike and all so empty and colorless! My heart grows hungry as I think\nof your great, green eyes and of the mouth that is like a little wound.\nI want you so, O dearest girl in all the world! I want you.... Ah, time\ntravels very slowly that brings you back to me, and, meanwhile, I can\nbut dream of you and send you impotent scrawls that only vex me with\ntheir futility. For my desire of you--'\n\n\"The remainder,\" said Mrs. Pendomer, clearing her throat once more,\n\"appears to consist of insanity and heretical sentiments, in about equal\nproportions, all written at the top of a boy's breaking voice. It isn't\nColonel Musgrave's voice--quite--is it?\"\n\nDuring the reading, Patricia, leaning on one elbow, had regarded her\ncompanion with wide eyes and flushed cheeks. \"Now, you see!\" she cried\nindignantly; \"he loved her! He was simply crazy about her.\"\n\n\"Why, yes.\" Mrs. Pendomer replaced the letter, carefully, almost\ncaressingly, among its companions. \"My dear, it was years ago. I think\ntime has by this wreaked a vengeance far more bitter than you could ever\nplan on the woman who, after all, never thought to wrong you. For the\nbitterest of all bitter things to a woman--to some women, at least--is\nto grow old.\"\n\nShe sighed, and her well-manicured fingers fretted for a moment with the\ncounterpane.\n\n\"Ah, who will write the tragedy of us women who were 'famous Southern\nbeauties' once? We were queens of men while our youth lasted, and\ndiarists still prattle charmingly concerning us. But nothing was\nexpected of us save to be beautiful and to condescend to be made much\nof, and that is our tragedy. For very few things, my dear, are more\npitiable than the middle-age of the pitiful butterfly woman, whose mind\ncannot--cannot, because of its very nature--reach to anything higher!\nMiddle-age strips her of everything--the admiration, the flattery, the\nshallow merriment--all the little things that her little mind longs\nfor--and other women take her place, in spite of her futile, pitiful\nefforts to remain young. And the world goes on as before, and there is a\nwhispering in the moonlit garden, and young people steal off for wholly\nsuperfluous glasses of water, and the men give her duty dances, and she\nis old--ah, so old!--under the rouge and inane smiles and dainty\nfripperies that caricature her lost youth! No, my dear, you needn't envy\nthis woman! Pity her, my dear!\" pleaded Clarice Pendomer, and with a\nnote of earnestness in her voice.\n\n\"Such a woman,\" said Patricia, with distinctness, \"deserves no pity.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mrs. Pendomer conceded, drily, \"she doesn't get it. Probably,\nbecause she always grows fat, from sheer lack of will-power to resist\nsloth and gluttony--the only agreeable vices left her; and by no stretch\nof the imagination can a fat woman be converted into either a pleasing\nor heroic figure.\"\n\nMrs. Pendomer paused for a breathing-space, and smiled, though not very\npleasantly.\n\n\"It is, doubtless,\" said she, \"a sight for gods--and quite certainly for\nmen--to laugh at, this silly woman striving to regain a vanished\nfrugality of waist. Yes, I suppose it is amusing--but it is also\npitiful. And it is more pitiful still if she has ever loved a man in the\nunreasoning way these shallow women sometimes do. Men age so slowly; the\nmen a girl first knows are young long after she has reached\nmiddle-age--yes, they go on dancing cotillions and talking nonsense in\nthe garden, long after she has taken to common-sense shoes. And the man\nis still young--and he cares for some other woman, who is young and has\nall that she has lost--and it seems so unfair!\" said Mrs. Pendomer.\n\nPatricia regarded her for a moment. The purple eyes were alert, their\nglance was hard. \"You seem to know all about this woman,\" Patricia\nbegan, in a level voice. \"I have heard, of course, what everyone in\nLichfield whispers about you and Rudolph. I have even teased Rudolph\nabout it, but until to-day I had believed it was a lie.\"\n\n\"It is often a mistake to indulge in uncommon opinions,\" said Mrs.\nPendomer. \"You get more fun and interest out of it, I don't deny, but\nthe bill, my dear, is unconscionable.\"\n\n\"So! you confess it!\"\n\n\"My dear, and who am I to stand aside like a coward and see you make a\nmountain of this boy-and-girl affair--an affair which Rudolph and I had\npractically forgotten--oh, years ago!--until to-day? Why--why, you\n_can't_ be jealous of me!\" Mrs. Pendomer concluded, half-mockingly.\n\nPatricia regarded her with deliberation.\n\nIn the windy sunlight, Mrs. Pendomer was a well-preserved woman, but,\nunmistakably, preserved; moreover, there was a great deal of her, and\nher nose was in need of a judicious application of powder, of which\nthere was a superfluity behind her ears. Was this the siren Patricia had\ndreaded? Patricia clearly perceived that, whatever had been her\nhusband's relations with this woman, he had been manifestly entrapped\ninto the imbroglio--a victim to Mrs. Pendomer's inordinate love of\nattention, which was, indeed, tolerably notorious; and Patricia's anger\nagainst Rudolph Musgrave gave way to a rather contemptuous pity and a\nhalf-maternal remorse for not having taken better care of him.\n\n\"No,\" answered Mrs. Pendomer, to her unspoken thought; \"no woman could\nbe seriously jealous of me. Yes, I dare say, I am _pass\u00e9e_ and vain and\nfrivolous and--harmless. But,\" she added, meditatively, \"you hate me,\njust the same.\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Pendomer----\" Patricia began, with cool courtesy; then\nhesitated. \"Yes,\" she conceded; \"I dare say, it is unreasonable--but I\ndo hate you like the very old Nick.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" spoke Mrs. Pendomer, with cheerfulness, \"everything is as\nit should be.\" She rose and smiled. \"I am sorry to say I must be leaving\nMatocton to-day; the Ullwethers are very pressing, and I really don't\nknow how to get out of paying them a visit----\"\n\n\"So sorry to lose you,\" cooed Patricia; \"but, of course, you know best.\nI believe some very good people are visiting the Ullwethers nowadays?\"\nShe extended the letters, blandly. \"May I restore your property?\" she\nqueried, with utmost gentleness.\n\n\"Thanks!\" Clarice Pendomer took them, and kissed her hostess, not\nwithout tenderness, on the brow. \"My dear, be kind to Rudolph. He--he is\nrather an attractive man, you know,--and other women are kind to him. We\nof Lichfield have always said that he and Jack Charteris were the most\ndangerous men that even Lichfield has ever produced----\"\n\n\"Why, do people really find Mr. Charteris particularly attractive?\"\nPatricia demanded, so quickly and so innocently that Mrs. Pendomer could\nnot deny herself the glance of a charlatan who applauds his fellow's\nlegerdemain.\n\nAnd Patricia colored.\n\n\"Oh, well--! You know how Lichfield gossips,\" said Mrs. Pendomer.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nColonel Musgrave had smoked a preposterous number of unsatisfying\ncigarettes on the big front porch of Matocton whilst Mrs. Pendomer was\nabsent on her mission; and on her return, flushed and triumphant, he\nrose in eloquent silence.\n\n\"I've done it, Rudolph,\" said Mrs. Pendomer.\n\n\"Done what?\" he queried, blankly.\n\n\"Restored what my incomprehensible lawyers call the _status quo_;\nachieved peace with honor; carried off the spoils of war; and--in\nshort--arranged everything,\" answered Mrs. Pendomer, and sank into a\nrustic chair, which creaked admonishingly. \"And all,\" she added,\nbringing a fan into play, \"without a single falsehood. _I_ am not to\nblame if Patricia has jumped at the conclusion that these letters were\nwritten to me.\"\n\n\"My word!\" said Rudolph Musgrave, \"your methods of restoring domestic\npeace to a distracted household are, to say the least, original!\" He\nseated himself, and lighted another cigarette.\n\n\"Oh, well, Patricia is not deaf, you know, and she has lived in\nLichfield quite a while.\" Mrs. Pendomer said abruptly, \"I have half a\nmind to tell you some of the things I know about Aline Van Orden.\"\n\n\"Please don't,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"for I would inevitably beard you\non my own porch and smite you to the door-mat. And I am hardly young\nenough for such adventures.\"\n\n\"And poor Aline is dead! And the rest of us are middle-aged now,\nRudolph, and we go in to dinner with the veterans who call us 'Madam,'\nand we are prominent in charitable enterprises.... But there was a time\nwhen we were not exactly hideous in appearance, and men did many mad\nthings for our sakes, and we never lose the memory of that time.\nPleasant memories are among the many privileges of women. Yes,\" added\nMrs. Pendomer, meditatively, \"we derive much the same pleasure from them\na cripple does from rearranging the athletic medals he once won, or a\nstarving man from thinking of the many excellent dinners he has eaten;\nbut we can't and we wouldn't part with them, nevertheless.\"\n\nRudolph Musgrave, however, had not honored her with much attention, and\nwas puzzling over the more or less incomprehensible situation; and,\nperceiving this, she ran on, after a little:\n\n\"Oh, it worked--it worked beautifully! You see, she would always have\nbeen very jealous of that other woman; but with me it is different. She\nhas always known that scandalous story about you and me. And she has\nalways known me as I am--a frivolous and--say, corpulent, for it is a\nmore dignified word--and generally unattractive chaperon; and she can't\nthink of me as ever having been anything else. Young people never really\nbelieve in their elders' youth, Rudolph; at heart, they think we came\ninto the world with crow's-feet and pepper-and-salt hair, all complete.\nSo, she is only sorry for you now--rather as a mother would be for a\nnaughty child; as for me, she isn't jealous--but,\" sighed Mrs. Pendomer,\n\"she isn't over-fond of me.\"\n\nColonel Musgrave rose to his feet. \"It isn't fair,\" said he; \"the\nletters were distinctly compromising. It isn't fair you should shoulder\nthe blame for a woman who was nothing to you. It isn't fair you should\nbe placed in such a false position.\"\n\n\"What matter?\" pleaded Mrs. Pendomer. \"The letters are mine to burn, if\nI choose. I have read one of them, by the way, and it is almost word for\nword a letter you wrote me a good twenty years ago. And you re-hashed it\nfor Patricia's benefit too, it seems! You ought to get a mimeograph. Oh,\nvery well! It doesn't matter now, for Patricia will say nothing--or not\nat least to you,\" she added.\n\n\"Still----\" he began.\n\n\"Ah, Rudolph, if I want to do a foolish thing, why won't you let me?\nWhat else is a woman for? They are always doing foolish things. I have\nknown a woman to throw a man over, because she had seen him without a\ncollar; and I have known another actually to marry a man, because she\nhappened to be in love with him. I have known a woman to go on wearing\npink organdie after she has passed forty, and I have known a woman to go\non caring for a man who, she knew, wasn't worth caring for, long after\nhe had forgotten. We are not brave and sensible, like you men. So why\nnot let me be foolish, if I want to be?\"\n\n\"If,\" said Colonel Musgrave in some perplexity, \"I understand one word\nof this farrago, I will be--qualified in various ways.\"\n\n\"But you don't have to understand,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"You mean--?\" he asked.\n\n\"I mean that I was always fond of Aline, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" And he was conscious, with vexation, that he had undeniably\nflushed.\n\n\"I mean, then, I am a woman, and _I_ understand. Everything is as near\nwhat it should be as is possible while Patricia is seeing so much of--we\nwill call it the artistic temperament.\" Mrs. Pendomer shrugged. \"But if\nI went on in that line you would believe I was jealous. And heaven knows\nI am not the least bit so--with the unavoidable qualification that,\nbeing a woman, I can't help rising superior to common-sense.\"\n\nHe said, \"You mean Jack Charteris--? But what on earth has he to do with\nthese letters?\"\n\n\"I don't mean any proper names at all. I simply mean you are not to undo\nmy work. It would only signify trouble and dissatisfaction and giving up\nall this\"--she waved her hand lightly toward the lawns of\nMatocton,--\"and it would mean our giving you up, for, you know, you\nhaven't any money of your own, Rudolph. Ah, Rudolph, we can't give you\nup! We need you to lead our Lichfield germans, and to tell us naughty\nlittle stories, and keep us amused. So _please_ be sensible, Rudolph.\"\n\n\"Permit me to point out I firmly believe that silence is the perfectest\nherald of joy,\" observed Colonel Musgrave. \"Only I do _not_ understand\nwhy you should have dragged John Charteris's name into this ludicrous\naffair----\"\n\n\"You really do not understand----?\"\n\nBut Colonel Musgrave's handsome face declared very plainly that he did\nnot.\n\n\"Well,\" Mrs. Pendomer reflected, \"I dare say it is best, upon the whole,\nyou shouldn't. And now you must excuse me, for I am leaving for the\nUllwethers' to-day, and I shan't ever be invited to Matocton again, and\nI must tell my maid to pack up. She is a little fool and it will break\nher heart to be leaving Pilkins. All human beings are tediously alike.\nBut, allowing ample time for her to dispose of my best lingerie and of\nher unavoidable lamentations, I ought to make the six-forty-five. I have\nnoticed that one usually does--somehow,\" said Mrs. Pendomer, and seemed\nto smack of allegories.\n\nAnd yet it may have been because she knew--as who knew\nbetter?--something of that mischief's nature which was now afoot.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe colonel burned the malefic letters that afternoon. Indeed, the\nepisode set him to ransacking the desk in which Patricia had found\nthem--a desk which, as you have heard, was heaped with the miscellaneous\ncorrespondence of the colonel's father dating back a half-century and\nmore. Much curious matter the colonel discovered there, for \"Wild Will\"\nMusgrave's had been a full-blooded career. And over one packet of\nletters, in particular, the colonel sat for a long while with an\nunwontedly troubled face.\n\n\n\n\nPART SIX - BYWAYS\n\n  \"Cry _Kismet!_ and take heart. Eros is gone,\n  Nor may we follow to that loftier air\n  Olympians breathe. Take heart, and enter where\n  A lighter Love, vine-crowned, laughs i' the sun,\n  Oblivious of tangled webs ill-spun\n  By ancient wearied weavers, for it may be\n  His guidance leads to lovers of such as we\n  And hearts so credulous as to be won.\n\n  \"Cry _Kismet!_ Put away vain memories\n  Of all old sorrows and of all old joys,\n  And learn that life is never quite amiss\n  So long as unreflective girls and boys\n  Remember that young lips were meant to kiss,\n  And hold that laughter is a seemly noise.\"\n\nPAUL VANDERHOFFEN. _Egeria Answers._\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nPatricia sat in the great maple-grove that stands behind Matocton, and\npondered over a note from her husband, who was in Lichfield\nsuperintending the appearance of the July number of the _Lichfield\nHistorical Association's Quarterly Magazine_. Mr. Charteris lay at\nher feet, glancing rapidly over a lengthy letter, which was from his\nwife, in Richmond.\n\nThe morning mail was just in, and Patricia had despatched Charteris for\nher letters, on the plea that the woods were too beautiful to leave, and\nthat Matocton, in the unsettled state which marks the end of the week in\na house-party, was intolerable.\n\nShe, undoubtedly, was partial to the grove, having spent the last ten\nmornings there. Mr. Charteris had overrated her modest literary\nabilities so far as to ask her advice in certain details of his new\nbook, which was to appear in the autumn, and they had found a vernal\nsolitude, besides being extremely picturesque, to be conducive to the\nforming of really matured opinions. Moreover, she was assured that none\nof the members of the house-party would misunderstand her motives;\npeople were so much less censorious in the country; there was something\nin the pastoral purity of Nature, seen face to face, which brought out\none's noblest instincts, and put an end to all horrid gossip and\nscandal-mongering.\n\nDidn't Mrs. Barry-Smith think so? And what was her real opinion of that\nrumor about the Hardresses, and was the woman as bad as people said she\nwas? Thus had Patricia spoken in the privacy of her chamber, at that\nhour when ladies do up their hair for the night, and discourse of\nmysteries. It is at this time they are said to babble out their hearts\nto one another; and so, beyond doubt, this must have been the real state\nof the case.\n\nAs Patricia admitted, she had given up bridge and taken to literature\nonly during the past year. She might more honestly have said within the\nlast two weeks. In any event, she now conversed of authors with a fitful\npersistence like that of an ill-regulated machine. Her comments were\ndelightfully frank and original, as she had an unusually good memory. Of\ntwo books she was apt to prefer the one with the wider margin, and she\nwas becoming sufficiently familiar with a number of poets to quote them\ninaccurately.\n\nWe have all seen John Charteris's portraits, and most of us have read\nhis books--or at least, the volume entitled _In Old Lichfield_, which\ncaused the _Lichfield Courier-Herald_ to apostrophize its author as a\n\"Child of Genius! whose ardent soul has sounded the mysteries of life,\nwhose inner vision sweeps over ever widening fields of thought, and\nwhose chiseled phrases continue patriotically to perpetuate the beauty\nof Lichfield's past.\" But for present purposes it is sufficient to say\nthat this jewelsmith of words was slight and dark and hook-nosed, and\nthat his hair was thin, and that he was not ill-favored. It may be of\ninterest to his admirers--a growing cult--to add that his reason for\nwearing a mustache in a period of clean-shaven faces was that, without\nit, his mouth was not pleasant to look upon.\n\n\"Heigho!\" Patricia said, at length, with a little laugh; \"it is very\nstrange that both of our encumbrances should arrive on the same day!\"\n\n\"It is unfortunate,\" Mr. Charteris admitted, lazily; \"but the blessed\nstate of matrimony is liable to these mishaps. Let us be thankful that\nmy wife's whim to visit her aunt has given us, at least, two perfect,\ngolden weeks. Husbands are like bad pennies; and wives resemble the cat\nwhose adventures have been commemorated by one of our really popular\npoets. They always come back.\"\n\nPatricia communed with herself, and to Charteris seemed, as she sat in\nthe chequered sunlight, far more desirable than a married woman has any\nright to be.\n\n\"I wish--\" she began, slowly. \"Oh, but, you know, it was positively\ncriminal negligence not to have included a dozen fairies among my\nsponsors.\"\n\n\"I too have desiderated this sensible precaution,\" said Charteris, and\nlaughed his utter comprehension. \"But, after all,\" he said, and snapped\nhis fingers gaily, \"we still have twenty-four hours, Patricia! Let us\nforget the crudities of life, and say foolish things to each other. For\nI am pastorally inclined this morning, Patricia; I wish to lie at your\nfeet and pipe amorous ditties upon an oaten reed. Have you such an\narticle about you, Patricia?\"\n\nHe drew a key-ring from his pocket, and pondered over it.\n\n\"Or would you prefer that I whistle into the opening of this door-key,\nto the effect that we must gather our rose-buds while we may, for Time\nis still a-flying, fa-la, and that a drear old age, not to mention our\nspouses, will soon descend upon us, fa-la-di-leero? A door-key is not\nArcadian, Patricia, but it makes a very creditable noise.\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish, _mon ami_!\" she protested, with an indulgent smile.\n\"I am unhappy.\"\n\n\"Unhappy that I have chanced to fall in love with you, Patricia? It is\nan accident which might befall any really intelligent person.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, ruefully.\n\n\"I have done wrong to let you talk to me as you have done of late.\nI--oh, Jack, I am afraid!\"\n\nMr. Charteris meditated. Somewhere in a neighboring thicket a bird\ntrilled out his song--a contented, half-hushed song that called his mate\nto witness how infinitely blest above all other birds was he. Mr.\nCharteris heard him to the end, and languidly made as to applaud; then\nMr. Charteris raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Of your husband, Patricia?\" he queried.\n\n\"I--Rudolph doesn't bother about me nowadays sufficiently to--notice\nanything.\"\n\nMr. Charteris smiled. \"Of my wife, Patricia?\"\n\n\"Good gracious, no! I have not the least doubt you will explain matters\nsatisfactorily to your wife, for I have always heard that practise makes\nperfect.\"\n\nMr. Charteris laughed--a low and very musical laugh.\n\n\"Of me, then, Patricia?\"\n\n\"I--I think it is rather of myself I am afraid. Oh, I hate you when you\nsmile like that! You have evil eyes, Jack! Stop it! Quit hounding me\nwith your illicit fascinations.\" The hand she had raised in threatening\nfashion fell back into her lap, and she shrugged her shoulders once\nmore. \"My nerves are somewhat upset by the approaching prospect of\nconnubial felicity, I suppose. Really, though, _mon ami_, your conceit\nis appalling.\"\n\nCharteris gave vent to a chuckle, and raised the door-key to his lips.\n\n\"When you are quite through your histrionic efforts,\" he suggested,\napologetically, \"I will proceed with my amorous pipings. Really,\nPatricia, one might fancy you the heroine of a society drama, working up\nthe sympathies of the audience before taking to evil ways. Surely, you\nare not about to leave your dear, good, patient husband, Patricia?\nHeroines only do that on dark and stormy nights, and in an opera\ntoilette; wearing her best gown seems always to affect a heroine in that\nway.\"\n\nMr. Charteris, at this point, dropped the key-ring, and drew nearer to\nher; his voice sank to a pleading cadence.\n\n\"We are in Arcadia, Patricia; virtue and vice are contraband in this\ncharming country, and must be left at the frontier. Let us be adorably\nfoolish and happy, my lady, and forget for a little the evil days that\napproach. Can you not fancy this to be Arcadia, Patricia?--it requires\nthe merest trifle of imagination. Listen very carefully, and you will\nhear the hoofs of fauns rustling among the fallen leaves; they are\nwatching us, Patricia, from behind every tree-bole. They think you a\ndryad--the queen of all the dryads, with the most glorious eyes and hair\nand the most tempting lips in all the forest. After a little, shaggy,\nbig-thewed ventripotent Pan will grow jealous, and ravish you away from\nme, as he stole Syrinx from her lover. You are very beautiful, Patricia;\nyou are quite incredibly beautiful. I adore you, Patricia. Would you\nmind if I held your hand? It is a foolish thing to do, but it is\npre\u00ebminently Arcadian.\"\n\nShe heard him with downcast eyes; and her cheeks flushed a pink color\nthat was agreeable to contemplation.\n\n\"Do--do you really care for me, Jack?\" she asked, softly; then cried,\n\"No, no, you needn't answer--because, of course, you worship me madly,\nunboundedly, distractedly. They all do, but you do it more convincingly.\nYou have been taking lessons at night-school, I dare say, at all sorts\nof murky institutions. And, Jack, really, cross my heart, I always\nstopped the others when they talked this way. I tried to stop you, too.\nYou know I did?\"\n\nShe raised her lashes, a trifle uncertainly, and withdrew her hand from\nhis, a trifle slowly. \"It is wrong--all horribly wrong. I wonder at\nmyself, I can't understand how in the world I can be such a fool about\nyou. I must not be alone with you again. I must tell my\nhusband--everything,\" she concluded, and manifestly not meaning a word\nof what she said.\n\n\"By all means,\" assented Mr. Charteris, readily. \"Let's tell my wife,\ntoo. It will make things so very interesting.\"\n\n\"Rudolph would be terribly unhappy,\" she reflected.\n\n\"He would probably never smile again,\" said Mr. Charteris. \"And my\nwife--oh, it would upset Anne, quite frightfully! It is our altruistic,\nnay, our bounden duty to save them from such misery.\"\n\n\"I--I don't know what to do!\" she wailed.\n\n\"The obvious course,\" said he, after reflection, \"is to shake off the\nbonds of matrimony, without further delay. So let's elope, Patricia.\"\n\nPatricia, who was really unhappy, took refuge in flippancy, and laughed.\n\n\"I make it a rule,\" said she, \"never to elope on Fridays. Besides, now\nI think of it, there is, Rudolph--Ah, Rudolph doesn't care a button's\nworth about me, I know. The funny part is that he doesn't know it. He\nhas simply assumed he is devoted to me, because all respectable people\nare devoted to their wives. I can assure you, _mon ami_, he would be a\nveritable Othello, if there were any scandal, and would infinitely\nprefer the bolster to the divorce-court. He would have us followed and\ntorn apart by wild policemen.\"\n\nMr. Charteris meditated for a moment.\n\n\"Rudolph, as you are perfectly aware, would simply deplore the terribly\nlax modern notions in regard to marriage and talk to newspaper reporters\nabout this much--\" he measured it between thumb and forefinger\n--\"concerning the beauty and chivalry of the South. He would\ndo nothing more. I question if Rudolph Musgrave would ever in any\ncircumstances be capable of decisive action.\"\n\n\"Ah, don't make fun of Rudolph!\" she cried, quickly. \"Rudolph can't help\nit if he is conscientious and in consequence rather depressing to live\nwith. And for all that he so often plays the jackass-fool about women,\nlike Grandma Pendomer, he is a man, Jack--a well-meaning, clean and\ndunderheaded man! You aren't; you are puny and frivolous, and you sneer\ntoo much, and you are making a fool of me, and--and that's why I like\nyou, I suppose. Oh, I wish I were good! I have always tried to be good,\nand there doesn't seem to be a hatpin in the world that makes a halo\nsit comfortably. Now, Jack, you know I've tried to be good! I've never\nlet you kiss me, and I've never let you hold my hand--until to-day--\nand--and----\"\n\nPatricia paused, and laughed.\n\n\"But we were talking of Rudolph,\" she said, with a touch of weariness.\n\"Rudolph has all the virtues that a woman most admires until she\nattempts to live in the same house with them.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" said Mr. Charteris, \"for the high opinion you entertain\nof my moral character.\" He bestowed a reproachful sigh upon her, and\ncontinued: \"At any rate, Rudolph Musgrave has been an unusually lucky\nman--the luckiest that I know of.\"\n\nPatricia had risen as if to go. She turned her big purple eyes on him\nfor a moment.\n\n\"You--you think so?\" she queried, hesitatingly.\n\nAfterward she spread out her hands in a helpless gesture, and laughed\nfor no apparent reason, and sat down again.\n\n\"Why?\" said Patricia.\n\nIt took Charteris fully an hour to point out all the reasons.\n\nPatricia told him very frankly that she considered him to be talking\nnonsense, but she seemed quite willing to listen.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nSunset was approaching on the following afternoon when Rudolph Musgrave,\nfresh from Lichfield,--whither, as has been recorded, the bringing out\nof the July number of the _Lichfield Historical Associations Quarterly\nMagazine_ had called him,--came out on the front porch at Matocton. He\nhad arrived on the afternoon train, about an hour previously, in time to\nsuperintend little Roger's customary evening transactions with an\nastounding quantity of bread and milk; and, Roger abed, his father,\nhaving dressed at once for supper, found himself ready for that meal\nsomewhat in advance of the rest of the house-party.\n\nIndeed, only one of them was visible at this moment--a woman, who was\nreading on a rustic bench some distance from the house, and whose back\nwas turned to him. The poise of her head, however, was not unfamiliar;\nalso, it is not everyone who has hair that is like a nimbus of\nthrice-polished gold.\n\nColonel Musgrave threw back his shoulders, and drew a deep breath.\nSubsequently, with a fine air of unconcern, he inspected the view from\nthe porch, which was, in fact, quite worthy of his attention.\nInteresting things have happened at Matocton--many events that have been\npreserved in the local mythology, not always to the credit of the old\nMusgraves, and a few which have slipped into a modest niche in history.\nIt was, perhaps, on these that Colonel Musgrave pondered so intently.\n\nOnce the farthingaled and red-heeled gentry came in sluggish barges to\nMatocton, and the broad river on which the estate faces was thick with\nbellying sails; since the days of railroads, one approaches the mansion\nthrough the maple-grove in the rear, and enters ignominiously by the\nback-door.\n\nThe house stands on a considerable elevation. The main portion, with its\nhipped roof and mullioned windows, is very old, but the two wings that\nstretch to the east and west are comparatively modern, and date back\nlittle over a century. Time has mellowed them into harmony with the\nmajor part of the house, and the kindly Virginia creeper has done its\nutmost to conceal the fact that they are constructed of plebeian bricks\nwhich were baked in this country; but Matocton was Matocton long before\nthese wings were built, and a mere affair of yesterday, such as the\nRevolution, antedates them. They were not standing when Tarleton paid\nhis famous visit to Matocton.\n\nIn the main hall, you may still see the stairs up which he rode on\nhorseback, and the slashes which his saber hacked upon the hand-rail.\n\nTo the front of the mansion lies a close-shaven lawn, dotted with\nsundry oaks and maples; and thence, the formal gardens descend in six\nbroad terraces. There is when summer reigns no lovelier spot than this\nbright medley of squares and stars and triangles and circles--all Euclid\nin flowerage--which glow with multitudinous colors where the sun\nstrikes. You will find no new flowers at Matocton, though. Here are\nverbenas, poppies, lavender and marigolds, sweet-william, hollyhocks and\ncolumbine, phlox, and larkspur, and meadowsweet, and heart's-ease, just\nas they were when Thomasine Musgrave, Matocton's first ch\u00e2telaine, was\nwont to tend them; and of all floral parvenus the gardens are innocent.\nBox-hedges mark the walkways.\n\nThe seventh terrace was, until lately, uncultivated, the trees having\nbeen cleared away to afford pasturage. It is now closely planted with\nbeeches, none of great size, and extends to a tangled thicket of\nfieldpines and cedar and sassafras and blackberry bushes, which again\nmasks a drop of some ten feet to the river.\n\nThe beach here is narrow; at high tide, it is rarely more than fifteen\nfeet in breadth, and is in many places completely submerged. Past this,\nthe river lapses into the horizon line without a break, save on an\nextraordinarily clear day when Bigelow's Island may be seen as a dim\nsmudge upon the west.\n\nAll these things, Rudolph Musgrave regarded with curiously deep interest\nfor one who had seen them so many times before. Then, with a shrug of\nthe shoulders, he sauntered forward across the lawn. He had planned\nseveral appropriate speeches, but, when it came to the point of giving\nthem utterance, he merely held out his hand in an awkward fashion, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Anne!\"\n\nShe looked up from her reading.\n\nShe did this with two red-brown eyes that had no apparent limits to\ntheir depth. Her hand was soft; it seemed quite lost in the broad palm\nof a man's hand.\n\n\"Dear Rudolph,\" she said, as simply as though they had parted yesterday,\n\"it's awfully good to see you again.\"\n\nColonel Musgrave cleared his throat, and sat down beside her.\n\nA moment later Colonel Musgrave cleared his throat once more.\n\nThen Mrs. Charteris laughed. It was a pleasant laugh--a clear, rippling\ncarol of clean mirth that sparkled in her eyes, and dimpled in her\nwholesome cheeks.\n\n\"So! do you find it very, very awkward?\"\n\n\"Awkward!\" he cried. Their glances met in a flash of comprehension which\nseemed to purge the air. Musgrave was not in the least self-conscious\nnow. He laughed, and lifted an admonitory forefinger.\n\n\"Oh, good Cynara,\" he said, \"I am not what I was. And so I cannot do it,\nmy dear--I really cannot possibly live up to the requirements of being a\nBuried Past. In a proper story-book or play, I would have to come back\nfrom New Zealand or the Transvaal, all covered with glory and epaulets,\nand have found you in the last throes of consumption: instead, you have\nfattened, Anne, which a Buried Past never does, and which shows a sad\nlack of appreciation for my feelings. And I--ah, my dear, I must confess\nthat my hair is growing gray, and that my life has not been entirely\nempty without you, and that I ate and enjoyed two mutton-chops at\nluncheon, though I knew I should see you to-day. I am afraid we are\nneither of us up to heroics, Anne. So let's be sensible and comfy, my\ndear.\"\n\n\"You brute!\" she cried--not looking irreparably angry, yet not without a\nreal touch of vexation; \"don't you know that every woman cherishes the\npicture of her former lovers sitting alone in the twilight, and growing\nlackadaisical over undying memories and faded letters? And you--you\napproach me, after I don't dare to think how many years, as calmly as if\nI were an old schoolmate of your mother's, and attempt to talk to me\nabout mutton-chops! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Rudolph\nMusgrave. You might, at least, have started a little at seeing me, and\nhave clasped your hand to your heart, and have said, 'You, you!' or\nsomething of the sort. I had every right to expect it.\"\n\nMrs. Charteris pouted, and then trifled for a moment with the pages of\nher book.\n\n\"And--and I want to tell you that I am sorry for the way I spoke to\nyou--that night,\" she swiftly said. Anne did not look at him. \"Women\ndon't understand things that are perfectly simple to men, I suppose--I\nmean--that is, Jack said--\"\n\n\"That you ought to apologize? It was very like him\"--and Colonel\nMusgrave smiled to think how like John Charteris it was. \"Jack is quite\nwonderful,\" he observed.\n\nShe looked up, saying impulsively, \"Rudolph, you don't know how happy he\nmakes me.\"\n\n\"Heartless woman, and would you tempt me to end the tragedy of my life\nwith a Shakesperian fifth act of poisonings and assassination? I spurn\nyou, temptress. For, after all, it was an unpleasantly long while ago we\nwent mad for each other,\" Musgrave announced, and he smiled. \"I fancy\nthat the boy and girl we knew of are as dead now as Nebuchadnezzar.\n'Marian's married, and I sit here alive and merry at'--well, not at\nforty year, unluckily--\"\n\n\"If you continue in that heartless strain, I shall go into the house,\"\nMrs. Charteris protested.\n\nHer indignation was exaggerated, but it was not altogether feigned;\nwomen cannot quite pardon a rejected suitor who marries and is content.\nThey wish him all imaginable happiness and prosperity, of course; and\nthey are honestly interested in his welfare; but it seems unexpectedly\ncallous in him. And besides his wife is so perfectly commonplace.\n\nMrs. Charteris, therefore, added, with emphasis: \"I am really\ndisgracefully happy.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it,\" said Musgrave, placidly. \"So am I.\"\n\n\"Oh, Rudolph, Rudolph, you are hopeless!\" she sighed. \"And you used to\nmake such a nice lover!\"\n\nMrs. Charteris looked out over the river, which was like melting gold,\nand for a moment was silent.\n\n\"I was frightfully in love with you, Rudolph,\" she said, as half in\nwonder. \"After--after that horrible time when my parents forced us to\nbehave rationally, I wept--oh, I must have wept deluges! I firmly\nintended to pine away to an early grave. And that second time I liked\nyou too, but then--there was Jack, you see.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Colonel Musgrave; \"yes, I see.\"\n\n\"I want you to continue to be friends with Jack,\" she went on, and her\nface lighted up, and her voice grew tender. \"He has the artistic\ntemperament, and naturally that makes him sensitive, and a trifle\nirritable at times. It takes so little to upset him, you see, for he\nfeels so acutely what he calls the discords of life. I think most men\nare jealous of his talents; so they call him selfish and finicky and\nconceited. He isn't really, you know. Only, he can't help feeling a\nlittle superior to the majority of men, and his artistic temperament\nleads him to magnify the lesser mishaps of life--such as the steak being\noverdone, or missing a train. Oh, really, a thing like that worries him\nas much as the loss of a fortune, or a death in the family, would upset\nanyone else. Jack says there are no such things as trifles in a\nharmonious and well-proportioned life, and I suppose that's true to men\nof genius. Of course, I am rather a Philistine, and I grate on him at\ntimes--that is, I used to, but he says I have improved wonderfully. And\nso we are ridiculously happy, Jack and I.\"\n\nMusgrave cast about vainly for an appropriate speech. Then he\ncompromised with his conscience, and said: \"Your husband is a very\nclever man.\"\n\n\"Isn't he?\" She had flushed for pleasure at hearing him praised. Oh,\nyes, Anne loved Jack Charteris! There was no questioning that; it was\nwritten in her face, was vibrant in her voice as she spoke of him.\n\n\"Now, really, Rudolph, aren't his books wonderful? I don't appreciate\nthem, of course, for I'm not clever, but I know you do. I don't see why\nmen think him selfish. I know better. You have to live with Jack to\nreally appreciate him. And every day I discover some new side of his\ncharacter that makes him dearer to me. He's so clever--and so noble.\nWhy, I remember--Well, before Jack made his first hit with _Astaroth's\nLackey_, he lived with his sister. They hadn't any money, and, of\ncourse, Jack couldn't be expected to take a clerkship or anything like\nthat, because business details make his head ache, poor boy. So, his\nsister taught school, and he lived with her. They were very happy--his\nsister simply adores him, and I am positively jealous of her\nsometimes--but, unfortunately, the bank in which she kept her money\nfailed one day. I remember it was just before he asked me to marry him,\nand told me, in his dear, laughing manner, that he hadn't a penny in\nthe world, and that we would have to live on bread and cheese and\nkisses. Of course, I had a plenty for us both, though, so we weren't\nreally in danger of being reduced to that. Well, I wanted to make his\nsister an allowance. But Jack pointed out, with considerable reason,\nthat one person could live very comfortably on an income that had\nformerly supported two. He said it wasn't right I should be burdened\nwith the support of his family. Jack was so sensitive, you see, lest\npeople might think he was making a mercenary marriage, and that his\nsister was profiting by it. Now, I call that one of the noblest things I\never heard of, for he is devotedly attached to his sister, and,\nnaturally, it is a great grief to him to see her compelled to work for a\nliving. His last book was dedicated to her, and the dedication is one of\nthe most tender and pathetic things I ever read.\"\n\nMusgrave was hardly conscious of what she was saying. She was not\nparticularly intelligent, this handsome, cheery woman, but her voice,\nand the richness and sweetness of it, and the vitality of her laugh,\ncontented his soul.\n\nAnne was different; the knowledge came again to him quite simply that\nAnne was different, and in the nature of things must always be a little\ndifferent from all other people--even Patricia Musgrave. He had no\ndesire to tell Anne Charteris of this, no idea that it would affect in\nany way the tenor of his life. He merely accepted the fact that she was,\nafter all, Anne Willoughby, and that her dear presence seemed, somehow,\nto strengthen and cheer and comfort and content beyond the reach of\nexpression.\n\nYet Musgrave recognized her lack of cleverness, and liked and admired\nher none the less. A vision of Patricia arose--a vision of a dainty,\nshallow, Dresden-china face with a surprising quantity of vivid hair\nabout it. Patricia was beautiful; and Patricia was clever, in her\npinchbeck way. But Rudolph Musgrave doubted very much if her mocking\neyes now ever softened into that brooding, sacred tenderness he had seen\nin Anne's eyes; and he likewise questioned if a hurried, happy thrill\nran through Patricia's voice when Patricia spoke of her husband.\n\n\"You have unquestionably married an unusual man,\" Musgrave said. \"I--by\nJove, you know, I fancy my wife finds him almost as attractive as you\ndo.\"\n\n\"Ah, Rudolph, I can't fancy anyone whom--whom you loved caring for\nanyone else. Don't I remember, sir, how irresistible you can be when you\nchoose?\"\n\nAnne laughed, and raised plump hands to heaven.\n\n\"Really, though, women pursue him to a perfectly indecent extent. I have\nto watch over him carefully; not that I distrust him, of course,\nfor--dear Jack!--he is so devoted to me, and cares so little for other\nwomen, that Joseph would seem in comparison only a depraved _rou\u00e9_. But\nthe _women_--why, Rudolph, there was an Italian countess at Rome--the\nimpudent minx!--who actually made me believe--However, Jack\nexplained all that, after I had made both a spectacle and a nuisance of\nmyself, and he had behaved so nobly in the entire affair that for days\nafterwards I was positively limp with repentance. Then in Paris that\nflighty Mrs. Hardress--but he explained that, too. Some women are\nshameless, Rudolph,\" Mrs. Charteris concluded, and sighed her pity for\nthem.\n\n\"Utterly so,\" Musgrave assented, gravely.\n\nHe was feeling a thought uncomfortable. To him the place had grown\nportentous. The sun was low, and the long shadows of the trees were\nblack on the dim lawn. People were assembling for supper, and passing to\nand fro under low-hanging branches; and the gaily-colored gowns of the\nwomen glimmered through a faint blue haze like that with which Boucher\nand Watteau and Fragonard loved to veil, and thereby to make wistful,\nsomehow, the antics of those fine parroquet-like manikins who figure in\ntheir _f\u00eates galantes._\n\nInside the house, someone was playing an unpleasant sort of air on the\npiano--an air which was quite needlessly creepy and haunting and\ninsistent. It all seemed like a grim bit out of a play. The tenderness\nand pride that shone in Anne's eyes as she boasted of her happiness\ntroubled Rudolph Musgrave. He had a perfectly unreasonable desire to\ncarry her away, by force, if necessary, and to protect her from clever\npeople, and to buy things for her.\n\n\"So, I am an old, old married woman now, and--and I think in some ways\nI suit Jack better than a more brilliant person might. I am glad your\nwife has taken a fancy to him. And I want you to profit by her example.\nJack says she is one of the most attractive women he ever met. He asked\nme to-day why I didn't do my hair like hers. She must make you very\nhappy, Rudolph?\"\n\n\"My wife,\" Colonel Musgrave said, \"is in my partial opinion, a very\nclever and very beautiful woman.\"\n\n\"Yes; cleverness and beauty are sufficient to make any man happy, I\nsuppose,\" Anne hazarded. \"Jack says, though--_Are_ cleverness and beauty\nthe main things in life, Rudolph?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" he protested.\n\n\"Now, that,\" she said, judicially, \"shows the difference in men. Jack\nsays a man loves a woman, not for her beauty or any other quality she\npossesses, but just because she is the woman he loves and can't help\nloving.\"\n\n\"Ah! I dare say that is the usual reason. Yes,\" said Colonel\nMusgrave,--\"because she is the woman he loves and cannot help loving!\"\n\nAnne clapped her hands. \"Ah, so I have penetrated your indifference at\nlast, sir!\"\n\nImpulsively, she laid her hand upon his arm, and spoke with earnestness.\n\"Dear Rudolph, I am so glad you've found the woman you can really love.\nJack says there is only one possible woman in the world for each man,\nand that only in a month of Sundays does he find her.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" said Musgrave. He had risen, and was looking down in friendly\nfashion into her honest, lovely eyes. \"Yes, there is only one possible\nwoman. And--yes, I think I found her, Anne, some years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThus it befell that all passed smoothly with Rudolph Musgrave and Anne\nCharteris, with whom he was not in the least in love any longer (he\nreflected), although in the nature of things she must always seem to him\na little different from all other people.\n\nAnd it befell, too, that the following noon--this day being a Sunday,\nwarm, clear, and somnolent--Anne Charteris and Rudolph Musgrave sat upon\nthe lawn before Matocton, and little Roger Musgrave was with them. In\nfact, these two had been high-handedly press-ganged by this small despot\nto serve against an enemy then harassing his majesty's equanimity and by\nhim, revilingly, designated as Nothing-to-do.\n\nAnd so Anne made for Roger--as she had learned to do for her dead\nson--in addition to a respectable navy of paper boats, a vast number of\n\"boxes\" and \"Nantucket sinks\" and \"picture frames\" and \"footballs.\" She\nhad used up the greater part of a magazine before the imp grew tired of\nher novel accomplishments.\n\nFor as he invidiously observed, \"I can make them for myself now, most\nas good as you, only I always tear the bottom of the boat when you pull\nit out, and my sinks are kind of wobbly. And besides, I've made up a\nstory just like your husband gets money for doing. And if I had a\nquarter I would buy that green and yellow snake in the toy-store window\nand wiggle it at people and scare them into fits.\"\n\n\"Sonnikins,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"suppose you tell us the story, and\nthen we will see if it is really worth a quarter, and try to save you\nfrom this unblushing mendicancy.\"\n\n\"Well, God bless Father and Mother and little cousins--Oh, no, that's\nwhat I say at night.\" Roger's voice now altered, assuming shrill\nsingsong cadences. His pensive gravity would have appeared excessive if\nmanifested by the Great Sphinx. \"What I meant to say was that once upon\na time when the Battle of Gettysburg was going on and houses were being\nrobbed and burned, and my dear grandfather was being shot through the\nheart, a certain house, where the richest man in town lived, was having\nfeast and merriment, never dreaming of any harm, or thinking of their\nlittle child Rachel, who was on the front porch watching the battle and\nscreaming with joy at every man that fell dead. One dark-faced man was\nstruck with a bullet and was hurt. He saw the child laughing at him and\nhis heart was full of revenge. So that night, when all had gone to bed,\nthe old dark-faced man went softly in the house and got the little girl\nand set the house on fire. And he carried her out in the mountains, and\nis that worth a quarter?\"\n\n\"Good heavens, no!\" said Anne. \"How dare you leave us in such harrowing\nsuspense?\"\n\n\"Well, a whole lot more happened, because all the while Rachel was\nasleep. When she woke up, she did not know where under the sun she was.\nSo she walked along for about an hour and came to a little village, and\nafter a few minutes she came to a large rock, and guess who she met? She\nmet her father, and when he saw her he hugged her so hard that when he\ngot through she did not have any breath left in her. And they walked\nalong, and after a while they came to the wood, and it was now about six\no'clock, and it was very dark, and just then nine robbers jumped out\nfrom behind the trees, and they took a pistol and shot Rachel's father,\nand the child fainted. Her papa was dead, so she dug a hole and buried\nhim, and went right back home. And of course that was all, and if I had\nthat snake, I wouldn't try to scare you with it, father, anyhow.\"\n\nSo Colonel Musgrave gave his son a well-earned coin, as the colonel\nconsidered, and it having been decreed, \"Now, father, _you_ tell a\nstory,\" obediently read aloud from a fat red-covered book. The tale was\nof the colonel's selecting, and it dealt with a shepherdess and a\nchimney-sweep.\n\n\"And so,\" the colonel perorated, \"the little china people remained\ntogether, and were thankful for the rivet in grandfather's neck, and\ncontinued to love each other until they were broken to pieces--And\nthe tale is a parable, my son. You will find that out some day. I wish\nyou didn't have to.\"\n\n\"But is that all, father?\"\n\n\"You will find it rather more than enough, sonnikins, when you begin to\ninterpret. Yes, that is all. Only you are to remember always that they\nclimbed to the very top of the chimney, where they could see the stars,\nbefore they decided to go back and live upon the parlor table under the\nbrand-new looking-glass. For the stars are disconcertingly unconcerned\nwhen you have climbed to them, and so altogether unimpressed by your\nachievement that it is the nature of all china people to slink home\nagain, precisely as your Rachel did--and as Mrs. Charteris will assure\nyou.\"\n\n\"I?\" said Anne. \"Now, honestly, Rudolph, I was thinking you ought not to\nlet him sit upon the grass, because he really has a cold. And if I were\nyou, I would give him a good dose of castor-oil to-night. Some people\ngive it in lemon-juice, I know, but I found with my boy that peppermint\nis rather less disagreeable. And you could easily send somebody over to\nthe store at the station----\"\n\nAnne broke off short. \"Was I being inadequate again? I am sorry, but\nwith children you never know what a cold may lead to, and I really do\nnot believe it good for him to sit in this damp grass.\"\n\n\"Sonnikins,\" said Rudolph Musgrave, \"you had better climb up into my\nlap, before you and I are Podsnapped from the universe by the only\nembodiment of common-sense just now within our reach.\"\n\nHe patted the boy's head and latterly resumed: \"I am afraid of you,\nAnne. Whenever I am imagining vain things or stitching romantic\npossibilities, like embroideries, about the fabric of my past, I always\nfind the real you in my path, as undeniable as a gas-bill. I don't\nbelieve you ever dare to think, because there is no telling what it\nmight lead to. You are simply unassailably armored by the courage of\nother people's convictions.\"\n\nHer candid eyes met his over the boy's bright head. \"And what in the\nworld are you talking about?\"\n\n\"I am lamenting. I am rending the air and beating my breast on account\nof your obstinate preference for being always in the right. I do wish\nyou would endeavor to impersonate a human being a trifle more\nconvincingly----\"\n\nBut the great gong, booming out for luncheon, interrupted him at this\npoint, and Colonel Musgrave was never permitted to finish his complaint\nagainst Anne's unimaginativeness.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nOn that same Sunday morning, while Anne Charteris and Rudolph Musgrave\ncontended with little Roger's boredom on the lawn before Matocton,\nPatricia and Charteris met by accident on the seventh terrace of the\ngardens. Patricia had mentioned casually at the breakfast-table that she\nintended to spend the forenoon on this terrace unsabbatically making\nnotes for a paper on \"The Symbolism of Dante,\" which she was to read\nbefore the Lichfield Woman's Club in October; but Mr. Charteris had not\noverheard her.\n\nHe was seated on the front porch, working out a somewhat difficult point\nin his new book, when it had first occurred to him that this particular\nterrace would be an inspiring and appropriate place in which to think\nthe matter over, undisturbed, he said. And it was impossible he should\nhave known that anyone was there, as the seventh terrace happens to be\nthe only one that, being planted with beech-trees, is completely\nscreened from observation. From the house, you cannot see anything that\nhappens there.\n\nIt was a curious accident, though. It really seemed, now that Patricia\nhad put an ending to their meetings in the maple-grove, Fate was\nconspiring to bring them together.\n\nHowever, as Mr. Charteris pointed out, there could be no possible\nobjection to this conspiracy, since they had decided that their\nfriendship was to be of a purely platonic nature. It was a severe trial\nto him, he confessed, to be forced to put aside certain dreams he had\nhad of the future--mad dreams, perhaps, but such as had seemed very dear\nand very plausible to his impractical artistic temperament.\n\nStill, it heartened him to hope that their friendship--since it was to\nbe no more--might prove a survival, or rather a veritable renaissance,\nof the beautiful old Greek spirit in such matters. And, though the blind\nchance that mismanaged the world had chained them to uncongenial, though\ncertainly well-meaning, persons, this was no logical reason why he and\nPatricia should be deprived of the pleasures of intellectual\nintercourse. Their souls were too closely akin.\n\nFor Mr. Charteris admitted that his soul was Grecian to the core, and\nout of place and puzzled and very lonely in a sordid, bustling world;\nand he assured Patricia--she did not object if he called her\nPatricia?--that her own soul possessed all the beauty and purity and\ncalm of an Aphrodite sculptured by Phidias. It was such a soul as Horace\nmight have loved, as Theocritus might have hymned in glad Greek song.\nPatricia flushed, and dissented somewhat.\n\n\"Frankly, _mon ami_,\" she said, \"you are far too attractive for your\ncompany to be quite safe. You are such an adept in the nameless little\nattentions that women love--so profuse with lesser sugar-plums of speech\nand action--that after two weeks one's husband is really necessary as an\nantidote. Sugar-plums are good, but, like all palatable things,\nunwholesome. So I shall prescribe Rudolph's company for myself, to ward\noff an attack of moral indigestion. I am very glad he has come\nback--really glad,\" she added, conscientiously. \"Poor old Rudolph! what\nbetween his interminable antiquities and those demented sections of the\nalphabet--What are those things, _mon ami_, that are always going up and\ndown in Wall Street?\"\n\n\"Elevators?\" Mr. Charteris suggested.\n\n\"Oh, you jay-bird! I mean those N.P.'s and N.Y.C.'s and those other\nletters that are always having flurries and panics and passed dividends.\nThey keep him incredibly busy.\"\n\nAnd she sighed, tolerantly. Patricia had come within the last two weeks\nto believe that she was neglected, if not positively ill-treated, by her\nhusband; and she had no earthly objection to Mr. Charteris thinking\nlikewise. Her face expressed patient resignation now, as they walked\nunder the close-matted foliage of the beech-trees, which made a\npleasant, sun-flecked gloom about them.\n\nPatricia removed her hat--the morning really was rather close--and\npaused where a sunbeam fell upon her copper-colored hair, and glorified\nher wistful countenance. She sighed once more, and added a finishing\ntouch to the portrait of a _femme incomprise_.\n\n\"Pray, don't think, _mon ami_,\" she said very earnestly, \"that I am\nblaming Rudolph! I suppose no wife can ever hope to have any part in her\nhusband's inner life.\"\n\n\"Not in her own husband's, of course,\" said Charteris, cryptically.\n\n\"No, for while a woman gives her heart all at once, men crumble theirs\naway, as one feeds bread to birds--a crumb to this woman, a crumb to\nthat--and such a little crumb, sometimes! And his wife gets what is left\nover.\"\n\n\"Pray, where did you read that?\" said Charteris.\n\n\"I didn't read it anywhere. It was simply a thought that came to me,\"\nPatricia lied, gently. \"But don't let's try to be clever. Cleverness is\nalways a tax, but before luncheon it is an extortion. Personally, it\nmakes me feel as if I had attended a welsh-rabbit supper the night\nbefore. Your wife must be very patient.\"\n\n\"My wife,\" cried Charteris, in turn resolved to screen an unappreciative\nmate, \"is the most dear and most kind-hearted among the Philistines. And\nyet, at times, I grant you--\"\n\n\"Oh, but, of course!\" Patricia said impatiently. \"I don't for a moment\nquestion that your wife is an angel.\"\n\n\"And why?\" His eyebrows lifted, and he smiled.\n\n\"Why, wasn't it an angel,\" Patricia queried, all impishness now, \"who\nkept the first man and woman out of paradise?\"\n\n\"If--if I thought you meant that----!\" he cried; and then he shrugged\nhis shoulders. \"My wife's virtues merit a better husband than Fate has\naccorded her. Anne is the best woman I have ever known.\"\n\nPatricia was not unnaturally irritated. After all, one does not take the\ntrouble to meet a man accidentally in a plantation of young beech-trees\nin order to hear him discourse of his wife's good qualities; and\nbesides, Mr. Charteris was speaking in a disagreeably solemn manner,\nrather as if he fancied himself in a cathedral.\n\nTherefore Patricia cast down her eyes again, and said:\n\n\"Men of genius are so rarely understood by their wives.\"\n\n\"We will waive the question of genius.\" Mr. Charteris laughed heartily,\nbut he had flushed with pleasure.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he continued, pacing up and down with cat-like fervor,\n\"that matrimony is always more or less of a compromise--like two\nconvicts chained together trying to catch each other's gait. After a\nwhile, they succeed to a certain extent; the chain is still heavy, of\ncourse, but it does not gall them as poignantly as it used to do. And I\nfear the artistic temperament is not suited to marriage; its capacity\nfor suffering is too great.\"\n\nMr. Charteris caught his breath in shuddering fashion, and he paused\nbefore Patricia. After a moment he grasped her by both wrists.\n\n\"We are chained fast enough, my lady,\" he cried, bitterly, \"and our\nsentence is for life! There are green fields yonder, but our allotted\nplace is here in the prison-yard. There is laughter yonder in the\nfields, and the scent of wild flowers floats in to us at times when we\nare weary, and the whispering trees sway their branches over the\nprison-wall, and their fruit is good to look on, and they hang within\nreach--ah, we might reach them very easily! But this is forbidden fruit,\nmy lady; and it is not included in our wholesome prison-fare. And so\ndon't think of it! We have been happy, you and I, for a little. We\nmight--don't think of it! Don't dare think of it! Go back and help your\nhusband drag his chain; it galls him as sorely as it does you. It galls\nus all. It is the heaviest chain was ever forged; but we do not dare\nshake it off!\"\n\n\"I--oh, Jack, Jack, don't you dare to talk to me like that! We must be\nbrave. We must be sensible.\" Patricia, regardless of her skirts, sat\ndown upon the ground, and produced a pocket-handkerchief. \"I--oh, what\ndo you mean by making me so unhappy?\" she demanded, indignantly.\n\n\"Ah, Patricia,\" he murmured, as he knelt beside her, \"how can you hope\nto have a man ever talk to you in a sane fashion? You shouldn't have\nsuch eyes, Patricia! They are purple and fathomless like the ocean, and\nwhen a man looks into them too long his sanity grows weak, and sinks\nand drowns in their cool depths, and the man must babble out his foolish\nheart to you. Oh, but indeed, you shouldn't have such eyes, Patricia!\nThey are dangerous, and to ask anybody to believe in their splendor is\nan insult to his intelligence, and besides, they are much too bright to\nwear in the morning. They are bad form, Patricia.\"\n\n\"We must be sensible,\" she babbled. \"Your wife is here; my husband is\nhere. And we--we aren't children or madmen, Jack dear. So we really must\nbe sensible, I suppose. Oh, Jack,\" she cried, upon a sudden; \"this isn't\nhonorable!\"\n\n\"Why, no! Poor little Anne!\"\n\nMr. Charteris's eyes grew tender for a moment, because his wife, in a\nfashion, was dear to him. Then he laughed, very musically.\n\n\"And how can a man remember honor, Patricia, when the choice lies\nbetween honor and you? You shouldn't have such hair, Patricia! It is a\nnet spun out of the raw stuff of fire and blood and of portentous\nsunsets; and its tendrils have curled around what little honor I ever\nboasted, and they hold it fast, Patricia. It is dishonorable to love\nyou, but I cannot think of that when I am with you and hear you speak.\nAnd when I am not with you, just to remember that dear voice is enough\nto set my pulses beating faster. Oh, Patricia, you shouldn't have such a\nvoice!\"\n\nCharteris broke off in speech. \"'Scuse me for interruptin',\" the old\nmulattress Virginia was saying, \"but Mis' Pilkins sen' me say lunch\nraydy, Miss Patrisy.\"\n\nVirginia seemed to notice nothing out-of-the-way. Having delivered her\nmessage, she went away quietly, her pleasant yellow face as\nimperturbable as an idol's. But Patricia shivered.\n\n\"She frightens me, _mon ami_. Yes, that old woman always gives me\ngooseflesh, and I don't know why--because she is as deaf as a post--and\nI simply can't get rid of her. She is a sort of symbol--she, and how\nmany others, I wonder!... Oh, well, let's hurry.\"\n\nSo Mr. Charteris was never permitted to finish his complaint against\nPatricia's voice.\n\nIt was absolutely imperative they should be on time for luncheon; for,\nas Patricia pointed out, the majority of people are censorious and lose\nno opportunity for saying nasty things. They are even capable of\nsneering at a purely platonic friendship which is attempting to preserve\nthe beautiful old Greek spirit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was chattering either of her plans for the autumn, or of Dante and\nthe discovery of his missing cantos, or else of how abominably Bob\nTownsend had treated Rosalind Jemmett, and they had almost reached the\nupper terrace--little Roger, indeed, his red head blazing in the\nsunlight, was already sidling by shy instalments toward them--when\nPatricia moaned inconsequently and for no ascertainable cause fainted.\n\nIt was the first time for four years she had been guilty of such an\nindiscretion, she was shortly afterward explaining to various members of\nthe Musgraves' house-party. It was the heat, no doubt. But since\neverybody insisted upon it, she would very willingly toast them in\nanother bumper of aromatic spirits of ammonia.\n\n\"Just look at that, Rudolph! you've spilt it all over your coat sleeve.\nI do wish you would try to be a little less clumsy. Oh, well, I'm spruce\nas a new penny now. So let's all go to luncheon.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nPatricia had not been in perfect health for a long while. It seemed to\nher, in retrospect, that ever since the agonies of little Roger's birth\nshe had been the victim of what she described as \"a sort of\nall-overishness.\" Then, too, as has been previously recorded, Patricia\nhad been operated upon by surgeons, and more than once....\n\n\"Good Lord!\" as she herself declared, \"it has reached the point that\nwhen I see a turkey coming to the dinner-table to be carved I can't help\ntreating it as an ing\u00e9nue.\"\n\nYet for the last four years she had never fainted, until this. It\ndisquieted her. Then, too, awoke faint pricking memories of certain\nsymptoms ... which she had not talked about ...\n\nNow they alarmed her; and in consequence she took the next morning's\ntrain to Lichfield.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nMrs. Ashmeade, who has been previously quoted, now comes into the story.\nShe is only an episode. Still, her intervention led to peculiar\nresults--results, curiously enough, in which she was not in the least\nconcerned. She simply comes into the story for a moment, and then goes\nout of it; but her part is an important one.\n\nShe is like the watchman who announces the coming of Agamemnon;\nClytemnestra sharpens her ax at the news, and the fatal bath is prepared\nfor the _anax andron_. The tragedy moves on; the house of Atreus falls,\nand the wrath of implacable gods bellows across the heavens; meanwhile,\nthe watchman has gone home to have tea with his family, and we hear no\nmore of him. There are any number of morals to this.\n\nMrs. Ashmeade comes into the story on the day Patricia went to\nLichfield, and some weeks after John Charteris's arrival at Matocton.\nSince then, affairs had progressed in a not unnatural sequence. Mr.\nCharteris, as we have seen, attributed it to Fate; and, assuredly, there\nmust be a special providence of some kind that presides over country\nhouses--a freakish and whimsical providence, which hugely rejoices in\nconfounding one's sense of time and direction.\n\nThrough its agency, people unaccountably lose their way in the simplest\nwalks, and turn up late and embarrassed for luncheon. At the end of the\nevening, it brings any number of couples blinking out of the dark, with\nno idea the clock was striking more than half-past nine.\n\nAnd it delights in sending one into the garden--in search of roses or\ndahlias or upas-trees or something of the sort, of course--and thereby\ncausing one to encounter the most unlikely people, and really, quite the\nlast person one would have thought of meeting, as all frequenters of\nhouse-party junketings will assure you. And thus is this special\nhouse-party providence responsible for a great number of marriages, and,\nit may be, for a large percentage of the divorce cases; for, if you\ndesire very heartily to see anything of another member of a house-party,\nthis lax-minded and easy-going providence will somehow always bring the\nevent about in a specious manner, and without any apparent thought of\nthe consequences.\n\nAnd the Musgraves' house-party was no exception.\n\nMrs. Ashmeade, for reasons of her own, took daily note of this. The\nothers were largely engrossed by their own affairs; they did not\nseriously concern themselves about the doings of their fellow-guests.\nAnd, besides, if John Charteris manifestly sought the company of\nPatricia Musgrave, her husband did not appear to be exorbitantly\ndissatisfied or angry or even lonely; and, be this as it might, the fact\nremained that Celia Reindan was at this time more than a little\ninterested in Teddy Anstruther; and Felix Kennaston was undeniably very\nattentive to Kathleen Saumarez; and Tom Gelwix was quite certainly\ndevoting the major part of his existence to sitting upon the beach with\nRosalind Jemmett.\n\nFor, in Lichfield at all events, everyone's house has at least a pane or\nso of glass in it; and, if indiscriminate stone-throwing were ever to\nbecome the fashion, there is really no telling what damage might ensue.\nAnd so had Mrs. Ashmeade been a younger woman--had time and an adoring\nhusband not rendered her as immune to an insanity _\u00e0 deux_ as any of us\nmay hope to be upon this side of saintship or senility--why, Mrs.\nAshmeade would most probably have remained passive, and Mrs. Ashmeade\nwould never have come into this story at all.\n\nAs it was, she approached Rudolph Musgrave with a fixed purpose this\nmorning as he smoked an after-breakfast cigarette on the front porch of\nMatocton. And,\n\n\"Rudolph,\" said Mrs. Ashmeade, \"are you blind?\"\n\n\"You mean--?\" he asked, and he broke off, for he had really no\nconception of what she meant.\n\nAnd Mrs. Ashmeade said, \"I mean Patricia and Charteris. Did you think I\nwas by any chance referring to the man in the moon and the Queen of\nSheba?\"\n\nIf ever amazement showed in a man's eyes, it shone now in Rudolph\nMusgrave's. After a little, the pupils widened in a sort of terror. So\nthis was what Clarice Pendomer had been hinting at.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he cried. \"Why--why, it is utter, preposterous, Bedlamite\nnonsense!\" He caught his breath in wonder at the notion of such a jest,\nremembering a little packet of letters hidden in his desk. \"It--oh, no,\nFate hasn't quite so fine a sense of humor as that. The thing is\nincredible!\" Musgrave laughed, and flushed. \"I mean----\"\n\n\"I don't think you need tell me what you mean,\" said Mrs. Ashmeade. She\nsat down in a large rocking-chair, and fanned herself, for the day was\nwarm. \"Of course, it is officious and presumptuous and disagreeable of\nme to meddle. I don't mind your thinking that. But Rudolph, don't make\nthe mistake of thinking that Fate ever misses a chance of humiliating us\nby showing how poor are our imaginations. The gipsy never does. She is a\nposturing mountebank, who thrives by astounding humanity.\"\n\nMrs. Ashmeade paused, and her eyes were full of memories, and very wise.\n\n\"I am only a looker-on at the tragic farce that is being played here,\"\nshe continued, after a little, \"but lookers-on, you know, see most of\nthe game. They are not playing fairly with you, Rudolph. When people set\nabout an infringement of the Decalogue they owe it to their self-respect\nto treat with Heaven as a formidable antagonist. To mark the cards is\nnot enough. They are not playing fairly, my dear, and you ought to know\nit.\"\n\nHe walked up and down the porch once or twice, with his hands behind\nhim; then he stopped before Mrs. Ashmeade, and smiled down at her.\nWithout, many locusts shrilled monotonously.\n\n\"No, I do not think you are officious or meddling or anything of the\nsort, I think you are one of the best and kindest-hearted women in the\nworld. But--bless your motherly soul, Polly! the thing is utterly\npreposterous. Of course, Patricia is young, and likes attention, and it\npleases her to have men admire her. That, Polly, is perfectly natural.\nWhy, you wouldn't expect her to sit around under the trees, and read\npoetry with her own husband, would you? We have been married far too\nlong for that, Patricia and I. She thinks me rather prosy and stupid at\ntimes, poor girl, because--well, because, in point of fact, I am. But,\nat the bottom of her heart--Oh, it's preposterous! We are the best\nfriends in the world, I tell you! It is simply that she and Jack have a\ngreat deal in common--\"\n\n\"You don't understand John Charteris. I do,\" said Mrs. Ashmeade,\nplacidly. \"Charteris is simply a baby with a vocabulary. His moral\nstandpoint is entirely that of infancy. It would be ludicrous to\ndescribe him as selfish, because he is selfishness incarnate. I\nsometimes believe it is the only characteristic the man possesses. He\nreaches out his hand and takes whatever he wants, just as a baby would,\nquite simply, and as a matter of course. He wants your wife now, and he\nis reaching out his hand to take her. He probably isn't conscious of\ndoing anything especially wrong; he is always so plausible in whatever\nhe does that he ends by deceiving himself, I suppose. For he is always\nplausible. It is worse than useless to argue any matter with him,\nbecause he invariably ends by making you feel as if you had been caught\nstealing a hat. The only argument that would get the better of John\nCharteris is knocking him down, just as spanking is the only argument\nwhich ever gets the better of a baby. Yes, he is very like a\nbaby--thoroughly selfish and thoroughly dependent on other people; only,\nhe is a clever baby who exaggerates his own helplessness in order to\nappeal to women. He has a taste for women. And women naturally like him,\nfor he impresses them as an irresponsible child astray in an artful and\ndesigning world. They want to protect him. Even I do, at times. It is\nreally maternal, you know; we would infinitely prefer for him to be soft\nand little, so that we could pick him up, and cuddle him. But as it is,\nhe is dangerous. He believes whatever he tells himself, you see.\"\n\nHer voice died away, and Mrs. Ashmeade fanned herself in the fashion\naddicted by perturbed women who, nevertheless, mean to have their say\nout--slowly and impersonally, and quite as if she was fanning some one\nelse through motives of charity.\n\n\"I don't question,\" Musgrave said, at length, \"that Jack is the highly\nestimable character you describe. But--oh, it is all nonsense, Polly!\"\nhe cried, with petulance, and with a tinge--if but the merest nuance\n--of conviction lacking in his voice.\n\nThe fan continued its majestic sweep from the shade into the sunlight,\nand back again into the shadow. Without, many locusts shrilled\nmonotonously.\n\n\"Rudolph, I know what you meant by saying that Fate hadn't such a fine\nsense of humor.\"\n\n\"My dear madam, it was simply thrown out, in the heat of\nconversation--as an axiom----\"\n\nFor a moment the fan paused; then went on as before. It was never\ncharged against Pauline Ashmeade, whatever her shortcomings, that she\nwas given to unnecessary verbiage.\n\nColonel Musgrave was striding up and down, divided between a disposition\nto swear at the universe at large and a desire to laugh at it. Somehow,\nit did not occur to him to doubt what she had told him. He comprehended\nnow that, chafing under his indebtedness in the affair of Mrs. Pendomer,\nCharteris would most naturally retaliate by making love to his\nbenefactor's wife, because the colonel also knew John Charteris. And for\nthe rest, it was useless to struggle against a Fate that planned such\npreposterous and elaborate jokes; one might more rationally depend on\nFate to work out some both ludicrous and horrible solution, he\nreflected, remembering a little packet of letters hidden in his desk.\n\nNevertheless, he paused after a while, and laughed, with a tolerable\naffectation of mirth.\n\n\"I say--I--and what in heaven's name, Polly, prompted you to bring me\nthis choice specimen of a mare's-nest?\"\n\n\"Because I am fond of you, I suppose. Isn't one always privileged to be\ndisagreeable to one's friends? We have been friends a long while, you\nknow.\"\n\nMrs. Ashmeade was looking out over the river now, but she seemed to see\na great way, a very great way, beyond its glaring waters, and to be\nrather uncertain as to whether what she beheld there was of a humorous\nor pathetic nature.\n\n\"Rudolph, do you remember that evening--the first summer that I knew\nyou--at Fortress Monroe, when we sat upon the pier so frightfully late,\nand the moon rose out of the bay, and made a great, solid-looking,\nsilver path that led straight over the rim of the world, and you talked\nto me about--about what, now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes!--I remember perfectly! One of the most beautiful evenings\nI ever saw. I remember it quite distinctly. I talked--I--and what, in\nthe Lord's name, did I talk about, Polly?\"\n\n\"Ah, men forget! A woman never forgets when she is really friends with a\nman. I know now you were telling me about Anne Charteris, for you have\nbeen in love with her all your life, Rudolph, in your own particular\nhalf-hearted and dawdling fashion. Perhaps that is why you have had so\nmany affairs. You plainly found the run of women so unimportant that it\nput every woman on her pride to prove she was different. Yes, I\nremember. But that night I thought you were trying to make love to me,\nand I was disappointed in you, and--yes, rather pleased. Women are all\nvain and perfectly inconsistent. But then, girl-children always take\nafter their fathers.\"\n\nMrs. Ashmeade rose from her chair. Her fan shut with a snap.\n\n\"You were a dear boy, Rudolph, when I first knew you--and what I liked\nwas that you never made love to me. Of all the boys I have known and\nhelped to form, you were the only sensible one--the only one who never\npresumed. That was rather clever of you, Rudolph. It would have been\nridiculous, for even arithmetically I am older than you.\n\n\"Wouldn't it have been ridiculous, Rudolph?\" she demanded, suddenly.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" Musgrave protested, in courteous wise. \"You--why,\nPolly, you were a wonderfully handsome woman. Any boy----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!--I was. I'm not now, am I, Rudolph?\" Mrs. Ashmeade threw back\nher head and laughed naturally. \"Ah, dear boy that was, it is unfair,\nisn't it, for an old woman to seize upon you in this fashion, and insist\non your making love to her? But I will let you off. You don't have to do\nit.\"\n\nShe caught her skirts in her left hand, preparatory to going, and her\nright hand rested lightly on his arm. She spoke in a rather peculiar\nvoice.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"the boy was a very, very dear boy, and I want the man\nto be equally brave and--sensible.\"\n\nMusgrave stared after her. \"I wonder--I wonder--? Oh, no, that\ncouldn't be,\" he said, and wearily.\n\n\"There must be some preposterous situations that don't come about.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd afterward he strolled across the lawn, where the locusts were\nshrilling, as if in a stubborn prediction of something which was\ninevitable, and he meditated upon a great number of things. There were a\nhost of fleecy little clouds in the sky. He looked up at them,\ninterrogatively.\n\nAnd then he smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"Yet I don't know,\" said he; \"for I am coming to the conclusion that the\nworld is run on an extremely humorous basis.\"\n\nAnd oddly enough, it was at the same moment that Patricia--in\nLichfield--reached the same conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nPART SEVEN - YOKED\n\n  \"We are as time moulds us, lacking wherewithal\n  To shape out nobler fortunes or contend\n  Against all-patient Fates, who may not mend\n  The allotted pattern of things temporal\n  Or alter it a jot or e'er let fall\n  A single stitch thereof, until at last\n  The web and its drear weavers be overcast\n  And predetermined darkness swallow all.\n\n  \"They have ordained for us a time to sing,\n  A time to love, a time wherein to tire\n  Of all spent songs and kisses; caroling\n  Such elegies as buried dreams require,\n  Love now departs, and leaves us shivering\n  Beside the embers of a burned-out fire.\"\n\nPAUL VANDERHOFFEN. _Egeria Answers._\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe doctor's waiting-room smelt strongly of antiseptics. That was\nPatricia's predominating thought as she wandered aimlessly about the\napartment. She fingered its dusty furniture. She remembered afterward\nthe steel-engraving of Jefferson Davis and his Cabinet, with General Lee\nexplaining some evidently important matter to those attentive and\nunhumanly stiff politicians; and she remembered, too, how in depicting\none statesman, who unavoidably sat with his back to the spectator, the\nartist had exceeded anatomical possibilities in order to obtain a\nrecognizable full-faced portrait. Yet at the time this picture had not\nroused her conscious attention.\n\nShe went presently to the long table austerely decorated with two rows\nof magazines, each partly covered by its neighbor, just as shingles are\nplaced. The arrangement irritated her unreasonably. She wanted to\ndisarrange these dog-eared pamphlets, to throw them on the floor, to\ndestroy them. She wondered how many other miserable people had tried to\nread these hateful books while they waited in this abominable room.\n\nShe started when the door of the consultation-room opened. The doctor\nwas patting the silk glove of a harassed-looking woman in black as he\nescorted her to the outer door, and was assuring her that everything was\ngoing very well indeed, and that she was not to worry, and so on.\n\nAnd presently he spoke with Patricia, for a long while, quite levelly,\nof matters which it is not suitable to record. Discreet man that he was,\nWendell Pemberton could not entirely conceal his wonder that Patricia\nshould have remained so long in ignorance of her condition. He spoke\nconcerning malformation and functional weaknesses and, although\nobscurely because of the bugbear of professional courtesy, voiced his\nopinion that Patricia had not received the most adroit medical treatment\nat the time of little Roger's birth.\n\nShe was dividedly conscious of a desire to laugh and of the notion that\nshe must remain outwardly serious, because though this horrible\nPemberton man was talking abject nonsense, she would presently be having\nhim as a dinner-guest.\n\nBut what if he were not talking nonsense? The possibility, considered,\nroused a sensation of falling through infinity.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Patricia civilly assented. \"These young doctors have taken\nthis out of me, and that out of me, as you might take the works out of a\nwatch. And it has done no good; and they were mistaken in their first\ndiagnoses, because what they took for true osteomalacia was only----\nWould you mind telling me again? Oh, yes; I had only a\npseudo-osteomalacic rhachitic pelvis, to begin with. To think of\nanybody's being mistaken about a simple little trouble like that! And I\nsuppose I was just born with it, like my mother and all those other\nluckless women with Musgrave blood in them?\"\n\n\"Fehling and Schliephake at least consider this variety of pelvic\nanomaly to be congenital in the majority of cases. But, without going\ninto the question of heredity at all, I think it only, fair to tell you,\nMrs. Musgrave----\" And Pemberton went on talking.\n\nNeither of the two showed any emotion.\n\nThe doctor went on talking. Patricia did not listen. The man was\ntalking, she comprehended, but to her his words seemed blurred and\nindistinguishable. \"Like a talking-machine when it isn't wound up\nenough,\" she decided.\n\nSubconsciously Patricia was thinking, \"You have two big beads of\nperspiration on your nose, and if I were to allude to the fact you would\nvery probably die of embarrassment.\"\n\nAloud Patricia said: \"You mean, then, that, to cap it all, a functional\ndisorder of my heart has become organic, so that I would inevitably die\nunder another operation? or even at a sudden shock? And that particular\noperation is now the solitary chance of saving my life! The dilemma is\nneat, isn't it? How God must laugh at the jokes He contrives,\" said\nPatricia. \"I wish that I could laugh. And I will. I don't care whether\nyou think me a reprobate or not, Dr. Pemberton, I want a good stiff\ndrink of whiskey--the Musgrave size.\"\n\nHe gave it to her.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nPatricia had as yet an hour to spend in Lichfield before her train left.\nShe passed it in the garden of her own home, where she had first seen\nRudolph Musgrave and he had fought with Pevensey. All that seemed very\nlong ago.\n\nThe dahlia leaves, she noticed, were edged with yellow. She must look to\nit that the place was more frequently watered; and that the bulbs were\ndug up in September. Next year she meant to set the dahlias thinly, like\na hedge....\n\n\"Oh, yes, I meant to. Only I won't be alive next year,\" she recollected.\n\nShe went about the garden to see if Ned had weeded out the wild-pea\nvines--a pest which had invaded the trim place lately. Only a few of the\nintruders remained, burnt-out and withered as they are annually by the\nmid-summer sun. There would be no more fight until next April.\n\n\"Oh, and I have prayed to You, I have always tried to do what You\nwanted, and I never asked You to let me be born locked up in a\ngood-for-nothing Musgrave body! And You won't even let me see a\nwild-pea vine again! That isn't much to ask, I think. But You won't let\nme do it. You really do have rather funny notions about Your jokes.\"\n\nShe began to laugh.\n\n\"Oh, very well!\" Patricia said aloud. \"It is none of my affair that You\nelect to run Your world on an extremely humorous basis.\"\n\nShe was at Matocton in good time for luncheon.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nColonel Musgrave had a brief interview with his wife after luncheon. He\nbegan with quiet remonstrance, and ended with an unheard extenuation of\nhis presumption. Patricia's speech on this occasion was of an unfettered\nand heady nature.\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" she said, when she had finally\npaused for breath, and had wiped away her tears, and had powdered her\nnose, viciously, \"to bully a weak and defenseless woman in this way. I\ndare say everybody in the house has heard us--brawling and squabbling\njust like a hod-carrier and his wife. What's that? You haven't said a\nword for fifteen minutes? Oh, la, la, la! well, I don't care. Anyhow, I\nhave, and I am perfectly sure they heard me, and I am sure I don't care\nin the least, and it's all your fault, anyway. Oh, but you have an\nabominable nature, Rudolph--a mean and cruel and suspicious nature. Your\nbald-headed little Charteris is nothing whatever to me; and I would have\nbeen quite willing to give him up if you had spoken to me in a decent\nmanner about it. You only _said_----? I don't care what you said; and\nbesides, if you did speak to me in a decent manner, it simply shows that\nyour thoughts were so horrid and vulgar that even you weren't so\nabandoned as to dare to put them into words. Very well, then, I won't be\nseen so much with him in future. I realize you are quite capable of\nbeating me if I don't give way to your absurd prejudices. Yes, you are,\nRudolph; you're just the sort of man to take pleasure in beating a\nwoman. After the exhibition of temper you've given this afternoon, I\nbelieve you are capable of anything. Hand me that parasol! Don't keep on\ntalking to me; for I don't wish to hear anything you have to say. You're\nsimply driving me to my grave with your continual nagging and abuse and\nfault-finding. I'm sure I wish I were dead as much as you do. Is my hat\non straight? How do you expect me to see into that mirror if you stand\ndirectly in front of it? There! not content with robbing me of every\npleasure in life, I verily believe you were going to let me go\ndownstairs with my hat cocked over one ear. And don't you snort and look\nat me like that. I'm not going to meet Mr. Charteris. I'm going driving\nwith Felix Kennaston; he asked me at luncheon. I suppose you'll object\nto him next; you object to all my friends. Very well! Now you've made me\nutterly miserable for the entire afternoon, and I'm sure I hope you are\nsatisfied.\"\n\nThere was a rustle of skirts, and the door slammed.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nColonel Musgrave went to his own room, where he spent an interval in\nmeditation. He opened his desk and took out a small packet of papers,\nsome of which he read listlessly. How curiously life re-echoed itself!\nhe reflected, for here, again, were castby love-letters potent to breed\nmischief; and his talk with Polly Ashmeade had been peculiarly\nreminiscent of his more ancient talk with Clarice Pendomer. Everything\nthat happened seemed to have happened before.\n\nBut presently he shook his head, sighing. Chance had put into his hands\na weapon, and a formidable weapon, it seemed to him, but the colonel did\nnot care to use it. He preferred to strike with some less grimy cudgel.\n\nThen he rang for one of the servants, questioned him, and was informed\nthat Mr. Charteris had gone down to the beach just after luncheon. A\nmoment later, Colonel Musgrave was walking through the gardens in this\ndirection.\n\nAs he came to the thicket which screens the beach, he called\nCharteris's name loudly, in order to ascertain his whereabouts. And the\nnovelist's voice answered--yet not at once, but after a brief silence.\nIt chanced that, at this moment, Musgrave had come to a thin place in\nthe thicket, and could plainly see Mr. Charteris; he was concealing some\nwhite object in the hollow of a log that lay by the river. A little\nlater, Musgrave came out upon the beach, and found Charteris seated upon\nthe same log, an open book upon his knees, and looking back over his\nshoulder wonderingly.\n\n\"Oh,\" said John Charteris, \"so it was you, Rudolph? I could not imagine\nwho it was that called.\"\n\n\"Yes--I wanted a word with you, Jack.\"\n\nNow, there are five little red-and-white bath-houses upon the beach at\nMatocton; the nearest of them was some thirty feet from Mr. Charteris.\nIt might have been either imagination or the prevalent breeze, but\nMusgrave certainly thought he heard a door closing. Moreover, as he\nwalked around the end of the log, he glanced downward as in a casual\nmanner, and perceived a protrusion which bore an undeniable resemblance\nto the handle of a parasol. Musgrave whistled, though, at the bottom of\nhis heart, he was not surprised; and then, he sat down upon the log, and\nfor a moment was silent.\n\n\"A beautiful evening,\" said Mr. Charteris.\n\nMusgrave lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"Jack, I have something rather difficult to say to you--yes, it is\ndeuced difficult, and the sooner it is over the better. I--why,\nconfound it all, man! I want you to stop making love to my wife.\"\n\nMr. Charteris's eyebrows rose. \"Really, Colonel Musgrave----.\" he began,\ncoolly.\n\n\"Now, you are about to make a scene, you know,\" said Musgrave, raising\nhis hand in protest, \"and we are not here for that. We are not going to\ntear any passions to tatters; we are not going to rant; we are simply\ngoing to have a quiet and sensible talk. We don't happen to be\ncharacters in a romance; for you aren't Lancelot, you know, and I am not\nup to the part of Arthur by a great deal. I am not angry, I am not\njealous, nor do I put the matter on any high moral grounds. I simply say\nit won't do--no, hang it, it won't do!\"\n\n\"I dare not question you are an authority in such matters,\" said John\nCharteris, sweetly--\"since among many others, Clarice Pendomer is near\nenough to be an obtainable witness.\"\n\nColonel Musgrave grimaced. \"But what a gesture!\" he thought,\nhalf-enviously. Jack Charteris, quite certainly, meant to make the most\nof the immunity Musgrave had purchased for him. None the less, Musgrave\nhad now his cue. Patricia must be listening.\n\nAnd so what Colonel Musgrave said was: \"Put it that a burnt child dreads\nthe fire--is that a reason he should not warn his friends against it?\"\n\n\"At least,\" said Charteris at length, \"you are commendably frank. I\nappreciate that, Rudolph. I honestly appreciate the fact you have come\nto me, not as the husband of that fiction in which kitchen-maids\ndelight, breathing fire and speaking balderdash, but as one sensible man\nto another. Let us be frank, then; let us play with the cards upon the\ntable. You have charged me with loving your wife; and I answer you\nfrankly--I do. She does me the honor to return this affection. What,\nthen, Rudolph?\"\n\nMusgrave blew out a puff of smoke. \"I don't especially mind,\" he said,\nslowly. \"According to tradition, of course, I ought to spring at your\nthroat with a smothered curse. But, as a matter of fact, I don't see why\nI should be irritated. No, in common reason,\" he added, upon\nconsideration, \"I am only rather sorry for you both.\"\n\nMr. Charteris sprang to his feet, and walked up and down the beach. \"Ah,\nyou hide your feelings well,\" he cried, and his laughter was a trifle\nunconvincing and a bit angry. \"But it is unavailing with me. I know! I\nknow the sick and impotent hatred of me that is seething in your heart;\nand I feel for you the pity you pretend to entertain toward me. Yes, I\npity you. But what would you have? Frankly, while in many ways an\nestimable man, you are no fit mate for Patricia. She has the sensitive,\nartistic temperament, poor girl; and only we who are cursed with it can\ntell you what its possession implies. And you--since frankness is the\norder of the day, you know--well, you impress me as being a trifle\ninadequate. It is not your fault, perhaps, but the fact remains that you\nhave never amounted to anything personally. You have simply traded upon\nthe accident of being born a Musgrave of Matocton. In consequence you\nwere enabled to marry Patricia's money, just as the Musgraves of\nMatocton always marry some woman who is able to support them. Ah, but it\nwas her money you married, and not Patricia! Any community of interest\nbetween you was impossible, and is radically impossible. Your marriage\nwas a hideous mistake, just as mine was. For you are starving her soul,\nRudolph, just as Anne has starved mine. And now, at last, when Patricia\nand I have seen our single chance of happiness, we cannot--no! we cannot\nand we will not--defer to any outworn tradition or to fear of Mrs.\nGrundy's narrow-minded prattle!\"\n\nCharteris swept aside the dogmas of the world with an indignant gesture\nof somewhat conscious nobility; and he turned to his companion in an\nattitude of defiance.\n\nMusgrave was smiling. He smoked and seemed to enjoy his cigarette.\n\nThe day was approaching sunset. The sun, a glowing ball of copper, hung\nlow in the west over a rampart of purple clouds, whose heights were\nsmeared with red. A slight, almost imperceptible, mist rose from the\nriver, and, where the horizon should have been, a dubious cloudland\nprevailed. Far to the west were orange-colored quiverings upon the\nstream's surface, but, nearer, the river dimpled with silver-tipped\nwaves; and, at their feet, the water grew transparent, and splashed over\nthe sleek, brown sand, and sucked back, leaving a curved line of\nbubbles which, one by one, winked, gaped and burst. There was a drowsy\npeacefulness in the air; behind them, among the beeches, were many\nstealthy wood-sounds; and, at long intervals, a sleepy, peevish\ntwittering went about the nested trees.\n\nIn Colonel Musgrave's face, the primal peace was mirrored.\n\n\"May I ask,\" said he at length, \"what you propose doing?\"\n\nMr. Charteris answered promptly. \"I, of course, propose,\" said he, \"to\nask Patricia to share the remainder of my life.\"\n\n\"A euphemism, as I take it, for an elopement. I hardly thought you\nintended going so far.\"\n\n\"Rudolph!\" cried Charteris, drawing himself to his full height--and he\nwas not to blame for the fact that it was but five-feet-six--\"I am, I\nhope, an honorable man! I cannot eat your salt and steal your honor. So\nI loot openly, or not at all.\"\n\nThe colonel shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I presuppose you have counted the cost--and estimated the necessary\nbreakage?\"\n\n\"True love,\" the novelist declared, in a hushed, sweet voice, \"is above\nsuch considerations.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Musgrave slowly, \"that any love worthy of the name will\nalways appraise the cost--to the woman. It is of Patricia I am\nthinking.\"\n\n\"She loves me,\" Charteris murmured. He glanced up and laughed. \"Upon my\nsoul, you know, I cannot help thinking the situation a bit\nfarcical--you and I talking over matters in this fashion. But I honestly\nbelieve the one chance of happiness for any of us hinges on Patricia and\nme chucking the whole affair, and bolting.\"\n\n\"No! it won't do--no, hang it, Jack, it will not do!\" Musgrave glanced\ntoward the bath-house, and he lifted his voice. \"I am not considering\nyou in the least--and under the circumstances, you could hardly expect\nme to. It is of Patricia I am thinking. I haven't made her altogether\nhappy. Our marriage was a mating of incongruities--and possibly you are\njustified in calling it a mistake. Yet, day in and day out, I think we\nget along as well together as do most couples; and it is wasting time to\ncry over spilt milk. Instead, it rests with us, the two men who love\nher, to decide what is best for Patricia. It is she and only she we must\nconsider.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are right!\" said Charteris, and his eyes grew tender. \"She must\nhave what she most desires; and all must be sacrificed to that.\" He\nturned and spoke as simply as a child. \"Of course, you know, I shall be\ngiving up a great deal for love of her, but--I am willing.\"\n\nMusgrave looked at him for a moment. \"H'm doubtless,\" he assented. \"Why,\nthen, we won't consider the others. We will not consider your wife,\nwho--who worships you. We won't consider the boy. I, for my part, think\nit is a mother's duty to leave an unsullied name to her child, but,\nprobably, my ideas are bourgeois. We won't consider Patricia's\nrelatives, who, perhaps, will find it rather unpleasant. In short, we\nmust consider no one save Patricia.\"\n\n\"Of course, one cannot make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.\"\n\n\"No; the question is whether it is absolutely necessary to make the\nomelet. I say no.\"\n\n\"And I,\" quoth Charteris smiling gently, \"say yes.\"\n\n\"For Patricia,\" Musgrave went on, as in meditation, but speaking very\nclearly, \"it means giving up--everything. It means giving up her friends\nand the life to which she is accustomed; it means being ashamed to face\nthose who were formerly her friends. We, the world, our world of\nLichfield, I mean--are lax enough as to the divorce question, heaven\nknows, but we can't pardon immorality when coupled with poverty. And you\nwould be poor, you know. Your books are tremendously clever, Jack,\nbut--as I happen to know--the proceeds from them would not support two\npeople in luxury; and Patricia has nothing. That is a sordid detail, of\ncourse, but it is worth considering. Patricia would never be happy in a\nthree-pair back.\"\n\nMr. Charteris was frankly surprised. \"Patricia has--nothing?\"\n\n\"Bless your soul, of course not! Her father left the greater part of his\nmoney to our boy, you know. Most of it is still held in trust for our\nboy, who is named after him. Not a penny of it belongs to Patricia, and\neven I cannot touch anything but a certain amount of interest.\"\n\nMr. Charteris looked at the colonel with eyes that were sad and hurt\nand wistful. \"I am perfectly aware of your reason for telling me this,\"\nhe said, candidly. \"I know I have always been thought a mercenary man\nsince my marriage. At that time I fancied myself too much in love with\nAnne to permit any sordid considerations of fortune to stand in the way\nof our union. Poor Anne! she little knows what sacrifices I have made\nfor her! She, too, would be dreadfully unhappy if I permitted her to\nrealize that our marriage was a mistake.\"\n\n\"God help her--yes!\" groaned Musgrave.\n\n\"And as concerns Patricia, you are entirely right. It would be hideously\nunfair to condemn her to a life of comparative poverty. My books sell\nbetter than you think, Rudolph, but still an author cannot hope to\nattain affluence so long as he is handicapped by any reverence for the\nEnglish language. Yes, I was about to do Patricia a great wrong. I\nrejoice that you have pointed out my selfishness. For I have been\nabominably selfish. I confess it.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" assented Musgrave, calmly. \"But, then, my opinion is,\nnaturally, rather prejudiced.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can understand what Patricia must mean to you\"--Mr. Charteris\nsighed, and passed his hand over his forehead in a graceful\nfashion,--\"and I, also, love her far too dearly to imperil her\nhappiness. I think that heaven never made a woman more worthy to be\nloved. And I had hoped--ah, well, after all, we cannot utterly defy\nsociety! Its prejudices, however unfounded, must be respected. What\nwould you have? This dunderheaded giantess of a Mrs. Grundy condemns me\nto be miserable, and I am powerless. The utmost I can do is to refrain\nfrom whining over the unavoidable. And, Rudolph, you have my word of\nhonor that henceforth I shall bear in mind more constantly my duty\ntoward one of my best and oldest friends. I have not dealt with you\nquite honestly. I confess it, and I ask your pardon.\" Mr. Charteris held\nout his hand to seal the compact.\n\n\"Word of honor?\" queried Colonel Musgrave, with an odd quizzing sort of\nfondness for the little novelist, as the colonel took the proffered\nhand. \"Why, then, that is settled, and I am glad of it. I told you, you\nknow, it wouldn't do. See you at supper, I suppose?\"\n\nAnd Rudolph Musgrave glanced at the bath-house, turned on his heel, and\npresently plunged into the beech plantation, whistling cheerfully. The\neffect of the melody was somewhat impaired by the apparent necessity of\nbreaking off, at intervals, in order to smile.\n\nThe comedy had been admirably enacted, he considered, on both sides; and\nhe did not object to Jack Charteris's retiring with all the honors of\nwar.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe colonel had not gone far, however, before he paused, thrust both\nhands into his trousers' pockets, and stared down at the ground for a\nmatter of five minutes.\n\nMusgrave shook his head. \"After all,\" said he, \"I can't trust them.\nPatricia is too erratic and too used to having her own way. Jack will\ntry to break off with her now, of course; but Jack, where women are\nconcerned, is as weak as water. It is not a nice thing to do, but--well!\none must fight fire with fire.\"\n\nThereupon, he retraced his steps. When he had come to the thin spot in\nthe thicket, Rudolph Musgrave left the path, and entered the shrubbery.\nThere he composedly sat down in the shadow of a small cedar. The sight\nof his wife upon the beach in converse with Mr. Charteris did not appear\nto surprise Colonel Musgrave.\n\nPatricia was speaking quickly. She held a bedraggled parasol in one\nhand. Her husband noted, with a faint thrill of wonder, that, at times,\nand in a rather unwholesome, elfish way, Patricia was actually\nbeautiful. Her big eyes glowed; they flashed with changing lights as\ndeep waters glitter in the sun; her copper-colored hair seemed luminous,\nand her cheeks flushed, arbutus-like. The soft, white stuff that gowned\nher had the look of foam; against the gray sky she seemed a freakish\nspirit in the act of vanishing. For sky and water were all one lambent\ngray by this. In the west was a thin smear of orange; but, for the rest,\nthe world was of a uniform and gleaming gray. She and Charteris stood in\nthe heart of a great pearl.\n\n\"Ah, believe me,\" she was saying, \"Rudolph isn't an ophthalmic bat. But\nGod keep us all respectable! is Rudolph's notion of a sensible\nmorning-prayer. So he just preferred to see nothing and bleat out\nedifying axioms. That is one of his favorite tricks. No, it was a comedy\nfor my benefit, I tell you. He will allow a deal for the artistic\ntemperament, no doubt, but he doesn't suppose you fetch along a\nwhite-lace parasol when you go to watch a sunset--especially a parasol\nhe gave me last month.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" protested Mr. Charteris, \"he saw nothing. I was too quick for\nhim.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \"I saw him looking at it. Accordingly, I\npaid no attention to what he said. But you--ah, Jack, you were splendid!\nI suppose we shall have to elope at once now, though?\"\n\nCharteris gave her no immediate answer. \"I am not quite sure, Patricia,\nthat your husband is not--to a certain extent--in the right. Believe me,\nhe did not know you were about. He approached me in a perfectly\nsensible manner, and exhibited commendable self-restraint; he has played\na difficult part to admiration. I could not have done it better myself.\nAnd it is not for us who have been endowed with gifts denied to Rudolph,\nto reproach him for lacking the finer perceptions and sensibilities of\nlife. Yet, I must admit that, for the time, I was a little hurt by his\nevident belief that we would allow our feeling for each other--which is\nrather beyond his comprehension, isn't it, dear?--to be coerced by\nmercenary considerations.\"\n\n\"Oh, Rudolph is just a jackass-fool, anyway.\" She was not particularly\ninterested in the subject.\n\n\"He can't help that, you know,\" Charteris reminded her, gently; then, he\nasked, after a little: \"I suppose it is all true?\"\n\n\"That what is true?\"\n\n\"About your having no money of your own?\" He laughed, but she could see\nhow deeply he had been pained by Musgrave's suspicions. \"I ask, because,\nas your husband has discovered, I am utterly sordid, my lady, and care\nonly for your wealth.\"\n\n\"Ah, how can you expect a man like that to understand--you? Why, Jack,\nhow ridiculous in you to be hurt by what the brute thinks! You're as\nsolemn as an owl, my dear. Yes, it's true enough. My father was not very\nwell pleased with us--and that horrid will--Ah, Jack, Jack, how\ngrotesque, how characteristic it was, his thinking such things would\ninfluence you--you, of all men, who scarcely know what money is!\"\n\n\"It was even more grotesque I should have been pained by his thinking\nit,\" Charteris said, sadly. \"But what would you have? I am so abominably\nin love with you that it seemed a sort of desecration when the man\nlugged your name into a discussion of money-matters. It really did. And\nthen, besides--ah, my lady, you know that I would glory in the thought\nthat I had given up all for you. You know, I think, that I would\nwillingly work my fingers to the bone just that I might possess you\nalways. So I had dreamed of love in a cottage--an idyl of blissful\npoverty, where Cupid contents himself with crusts and kisses, and mocks\nat the proverbial wolf on the doorstep. And I give you my word that\nuntil to-day I had not suspected how blindly selfish I have been! For\npoor old prosaic Rudolph is in the right, after all. Your delicate,\ntender beauty must not be dragged down to face the unlovely realities\nand petty deprivations and squalid makeshifts of such an existence as\nours would be. True, I would glory in them--ah, luxury and riches mean\nlittle to me, my dear, and I can conceive of no greater happiness than\nto starve with you. But true love knows how to sacrifice itself. Your\nhusband was right; it would not be fair to you, Patricia.\"\n\n\"You--you are going to leave me?\"\n\n\"Yes; and I pray that I may be strong enough to relinquish you forever,\nbecause your welfare is more dear to me than my own happiness. No, I do\nnot pretend that this is easy to do. But when my misery is earned by\nserving you I prize my misery.\" Charteris tried to smile. \"What would\nyou have? I love you,\" he said, simply.\n\n\"Ah, my dear!\" she cried.\n\nMusgrave's heart was sick within him as he heard the same notes in her\nvoice that echoed in Anne's voice when she spoke of her husband. This\nwas a new Patricia; her speech was low and gentle now, and her eyes held\na light Rudolph Musgrave had not seen there for a long while.\n\n\"Ah, my dear, you are the noblest man I have ever known; I wish we women\ncould be like men. But, oh, Jack, Jack, don't be quixotic! I can't give\nyou up, my dear--that would never be for my good. Think how unhappy I\nhave been all these years; think how Rudolph is starving my soul! I want\nto be free, Jack; I want to live my own life,--for at least a month or\nso--\"\n\nPatricia shivered here. \"But none of us is sure of living for a month.\nYou've shown me a glimpse of what life might be; don't let me sink back\ninto the old, humdrum existence from a foolish sense of honor! I tell\nyou, I should go mad! I mean to have my fling while I can get it. And I\nmean to have it with you, Jack--just you! I don't fear poverty. You\ncould write some more wonderful books. I could work, too, Jack dear.\nI--I could teach music--or take in washing--or something, anyway. Lots\nof women support themselves, you know. Oh, Jack, we would be so happy!\nDon't be honorable and brave and disagreeable, Jack dear!\"\n\nFor a moment Charteris was silent. The nostrils of his beak-like nose\nwidened a little, and a curious look came into his face. He discovered\nsomething in the sand that interested him.\n\n\"After all,\" he demanded, slowly, \"is it necessary--to go away--to be\nhappy?\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\" Her hand lifted from his arm; then quick remorse\nsmote her, and it fluttered back, confidingly.\n\nCharteris rose to his feet. \"It is, doubtless, a very spectacular and\nvery stirring performance to cast your cap over the wind-mill in the\nface of the world; but, after all, is it not a bit foolish, Patricia?\nLots of people manage these things--more quietly.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jack!\" Patricia's face turned red, then white, and stiffened in a\nsort of sick terror. She was a frightened Columbine in stone. \"I thought\nyou cared for me--really, not--that way.\"\n\nPatricia rose and spoke with composure. \"I think I'll go back to the\nhouse, Mr. Charteris. It's a bit chilly here. You needn't bother to\ncome.\"\n\nThen Mr. Charteris laughed--a choking, sobbing laugh. He raised his\nhands impotently toward heaven. \"And to think,\" he cried, \"to think that\na man may love a woman with his whole heart--with all that is best and\nnoblest in him--and she understand him so little!\"\n\n\"I do not think I have misunderstood you,\" Patricia said, in a crisp\nvoice. \"Your proposition was very explicit. I--am sorry. I thought I had\nfound one thing in the world which I would regret to leave--\"\n\n\"And you really believed that I could sully the great love I bear you by\nstooping to--that! You really believed that I would sacrifice to you my\nhome life, my honor, my prospects--all that a man can give--without\ntesting the quality of your love! You did not know that I spoke to try\nyou--you actually did not know! Eh, but yours is a light nature,\nPatricia! I do not reproach you, for you are only as your narrow\nPhilistine life has made you. Yet I had hoped better things of you,\nPatricia. But you, who pretend to care for me, have leaped at your first\nopportunity to pain me--and, if it be any comfort to you, I confess you\nhave pained me beyond words.\" And he sank down on the log, and buried\nhis face in his hands.\n\nShe came to him--it was pitiable to see how she came to him, laughing\nand sobbing all in one breath--and knelt humbly by his side, and raised\na grieved, shamed, penitent face to his.\n\n\"Forgive me!\" she wailed; \"oh, forgive me!\"\n\n\"You have pained me beyond words, Patricia,\" he repeated. He was not\nangry--only sorrowful and very much hurt.\n\n\"Ah, Jack! dear Jack, forgive me!\"\n\nMr. Charteris sighed. \"But, of course, I forgive you, Patricia,\" he\nsaid. \"I cannot help it, though, that I am foolishly sensitive where you\nare concerned. And I had hoped you knew as much.\"\n\nShe was happy now. \"Dear boy,\" she murmured, \"don't you see it's just\nthese constant proofs of the greatness and the wonderfulness of your\nlove--Really, though, Jack, wasn't it too horrid of me to misunderstand\nyou so? Are you quite sure you're forgiven me entirely--without any\nnasty little reservations?\"\n\nMr. Charteris was quite sure. His face was still sad, but it was\nbenevolent.\n\n\"Don't you see,\" she went on, \"that it's just these things that make me\ncare for you so much, and feel sure as eggs is eggs we will be happy?\nAh, Jack, we will be so utterly happy that I am almost afraid to think\nof it!\" Patricia wiped away the last tear, and laughed, and added, in a\nmatter-of-fact fashion: \"There's a train at six-five in the morning; we\ncan leave by that, before anyone is up.\"\n\nCharteris started. \"Your husband loves you,\" he said, in gentle reproof.\n\"And quite candidly, you know, Rudolph is worth ten of me.\"\n\n\"Bah, I tell you, that was a comedy for my benefit,\" she protested, and\nbegan to laugh. Patricia was unutterably happy now, because she, and not\nJohn Charteris, had been in the wrong. \"Poor Rudolph!--he has such a\nsmug horror of the divorce-court that he would even go so far as to\npretend to be in love with his own wife in order to keep out of it.\nReally, Jack, both our better-halves are horribly commonplace and they\nwill be much better off without us.\"\n\n\"You forget that Rudolph has my word of honor,\" said Mr. Charteris, in\nindignation.\n\nAnd that instant, with one of his baffling changes of mood, he began to\nlaugh. \"Really, though, Patricia, you are very pretty. You are April\nembodied in sweet flesh; your soul is just a wisp of April cloud, and\nyour life an April day, half sun that only seems to warm, and half\ntempest that only plays at ferocity; but you are very pretty. That is\nwhy I am thinking, light-headedly, it would be a fine and past doubt an\nagreeable exploit to give up everything for such a woman, and am\ncomplacently comparing myself to Antony at Actium. I am thinking it\nwould be an interesting episode in one's _Life and Letters_. You see, my\ndear, I honestly believe the world revolves around John\nCharteris--although of course I would never admit that to you if I\nthought for a moment you would take me seriously.\"\n\nThen presently, sighing, he was grave again. \"But, no! Rudolph has my\nword of honor,\" Mr. Charteris repeated, and with unconcealed regret.\n\n\"Ah, does that matter?\" she cried. \"Does anything matter, except that we\nlove each other? I tell you I have given the best part of my life to\nthat man, but I mean to make the most of what is left. He has had my\nyouth, my love--there was a time, you know, when I actually fancied I\ncared for him--and he has only made me unhappy. I hate him, I loathe\nhim, I detest him, I despise him! I never intend to speak to him\nagain--oh, yes, I shall have to at supper, I suppose, but that doesn't\ncount. And I tell you I mean to be happy in the only way that's\npossible. Everyone has a right to do that. A woman has an especial\nright to take her share of happiness in any way she can, because her\nhour of it is so short. Sometimes--sometimes the woman knows how short\nit is and it almost frightens her.... But at best, a woman can be really\nhappy through love alone, Jack dear, and it's only when we are young and\ngood to look at that men care for us; after that, there is nothing left\nbut to take to either religion or hand-embroidery, so what does it\nmatter, after all? Yes, they all grow tired after a while. Jack, I am\nonly a vain and frivolous person of superlative charm, but I love you\nvery much, my dear, and I solemnly swear to commit suicide the moment my\nfirst wrinkle arrives. You shall never grow tired of me, my dear.\"\n\nShe laughed to think how true this was.\n\nShe hurried on: \"Jack, kneel down at once, and swear that you are\nperfectly sore with loving me, as that ridiculous person says in\nDickens, and whose name I never could remember. Oh, I forgot--Dickens\ncaricatures nature, doesn't he, and isn't read by really cultured\npeople? You will have to educate me up to your level, Jack, and I warn\nyou in advance you will not have time to do it. Yes, I am quite aware\nthat I am talking nonsense, and am on the verge of hysterics, thank you,\nbut I rather like it. It is because I am going to have you all to myself\nfor whatever future there is, and the thought makes me quite drunk. Will\nyou kindly ring for the patrol-wagon, Jack? Jack, are you quite sure you\nlove me? Are you perfectly certain you never loved any one else half so\nmuch? No, don't answer me, for I intend to do all the talking for both\nof us for the future! I shall tyrannize over you frightfully, and you\nwill like it. All I ask in return is that you will be a good boy--by\nwhich I mean a naughty boy--and do solemnly swear, promise and affirm\nthat you will meet me at the side-door at half-past five in the morning,\nwith a portmanteau and the intention of never going back to your wife.\nYou swear it? Thank you so much! Now, I think I would like to cry for a\nfew minutes, and, after that, we will go back to the house, before\nsupper is over and my eyes are perfectly crimson.\"\n\nIn fact, Mr. Charteris had consented. Patricia was irresistible as she\npleaded and mocked and scolded and coaxed and laughed and cried, all in\none bewildering breath. Her plan was simple; it was to slip out of\nMatocton at dawn, and walk to the near-by station. There they would take\nthe train, and snap their fingers at convention. The scheme sounded\npreposterous in outline, but she demonstrated its practicability in\nperformance. And Mr. Charteris consented.\n\nRudolph Musgrave sat in the shadow of the cedar with fierce and confused\nemotions whirling in his soul. He certainly had never thought of this\ncontingency.\n\n\n\n\nPART EIGHT - HARVEST\n\n  \"Time was I coveted the woes they rued\n  Whose love commemorates them,--I that meant\n  To get like grace of love then!--and intent\n  To win as they had done love's plenitude,\n  Rapture and havoc, vauntingly I sued\n  That love like theirs might make a toy of me,\n  At will caressed, at will (if publicly)\n  Demolished, as Love found or found not good.\n\n  \"To-day I am no longer overbrave.\n  I have a fever,--I that always knew\n  This hour was certain!--and am too weak to rave,\n  Too tired to seek (as later I must do)\n  Tried remedies--time, manhood and the grave--\n  To drug, abate and banish love of you.\"\nALLEN ROSSITER. _A Fragment_.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nWhen Patricia and Charteris had left the beach, Colonel Musgrave parted\nthe underbrush and stepped down upon the sand He must have air--air and\nan open place wherein to fight this out.\n\nNight had risen about him in bland emptiness. There were no stars\noverhead, but a patient, wearied, ancient moon pushed through the\nclouds. The trees and the river conferred with one another doubtfully.\n\nHe paced up and down the beach....\n\nMusgrave laughed in the darkness. His heart was racing, racing in him,\nand his thoughts were blown foam. He raised his hat and bowed\nfantastically in the darkness, because the colonel loved his gesture.\n\n\"Signor Lucifer, I present my compliments. You have discoursed with me\nvery plausibly. I honor your cunning, signor, but if you are indeed a\ngentleman, as I have always heard, you will now withdraw and permit me\nto regard the matter from a standpoint other than my own. For the others\nare weak, signor; as you have doubtless discovered, good women and bad\nmen are the weakest of their sex. I am the strongest among them, for all\nthat I am no Hercules; and the outcome of this matter must rest with\nme.\"\n\nSo he sat presently upon the log, where Charteris had sat when Musgrave\ncame to this beach at sunset. Very long ago that seemed now. For now the\ncolonel was tired--physically outworn, it seemed to him, as if after\nprolonged exertion--and now the moon looked down upon him, passionless,\ncold, inexorable, and seemed to await the colonel's decision.\n\nAnd it was woefully hard to come to any decision. For, as you know by\nthis, it was the colonel's besetting infirmity to shrink from making\nchanges; instinctively he balked--under shelter of whatever\ngrandiloquent excuse--against commission of any action which would alter\nhis relations with accustomed circumstances or persons. To guide events\nwas never his forte, as he forlornly knew; and here he was condemned\nperforce to play that uncongenial r\u00f4le, with slender chances of reward.\n\nYet always Anne's face floated in the darkness. Always Anne's voice\nwhispered through the lisping of the beeches, through the murmur of the\nwater....\n\nHe sat thus for a long while.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nMusgrave was, not unnaturally, late for supper. It is not to be supposed\nthat at this meal the colonel faltered in his duties as a host, for, to\nthe contrary, he narrated several anecdotes in his neatest style. It was\nwith him a point of honor always to be in company the social triumph of\nhis generation. He observed with idle interest that Charteris and\nPatricia avoided each other in a rather marked manner. Both seemed a\ntrifle more serious than they were wont to be.\n\nAfter supper, Tom Gelwix brought forth a mandolin, and most of the\nhouse-party sang songs, sentimental and otherwise, upon the front porch\nof Matocton. Anne had disappeared somewhere. Musgrave subsequently\ndiscovered her in one of the drawing-rooms, puzzling over a number of\npapers which her maid had evidently just brought to her.\n\nMrs. Charteris looked up with a puckered brow. \"Rudolph,\" said she,\n\"haven't you an account at the Occidental Bank?\"\n\n\"Hardly an account, dear lady,--merely a deposit large enough to\nentitle me to receive monthly notices that I have overdrawn it.\"\n\n\"Why, then, of course, you have a cheque-book. Horrible things, aren't\nthey?--such a nuisance remembering to fill out those little stubs. Of\ncourse, I forgot to bring mine with me--I always do; and equally, of\ncourse, a vexatious debt turns up and finds me without an Occidental\nBank cheque to my name.\"\n\nMusgrave was amused. \"That,\" said he, \"is easily remedied. I will get\nyou one; though even if--Ah, well, what is the good of trying to teach\nyou adorable women anything about business! You shall have your\nindispensable blank form in three minutes.\"\n\nHe returned in rather less than that time, with the cheque. Anne was\nalone now. She was gowned in some dull, soft, yellow stuff, and sat by a\nsmall, marble-topped table, twiddling a fountain-pen.\n\n\"You mustn't sneer at my business methods, Rudolph,\" she said, pouting a\nlittle as she filled out the cheque. \"It isn't polite, sir, in the first\nplace, and, in the second, I am really very methodical. Of course, I am\nalways losing my cheque-book, and drawing cheques and forgetting to\nenter them, and I usually put down the same deposit two or three\ntimes--all women do that; but, otherwise, I am really very careful. I\nmanage all the accounts; I can't expect Jack to do that, you know.\" Mrs.\nCharteris signed her name with a flourish, and nodded at the colonel\nwisely. \"Dear infant, but he is quite too horribly unpractical. Do you\nknow this bill has been due--oh, for months--and he forgot it entirely\nuntil this evening. Fortunately, he can settle it to-morrow; those\ndisagreeable publishers of his have telegraphed for him to come to New\nYork at once, you know. Otherwise--dear, dear! but marrying a genius is\nabsolutely ruinous to one's credit, isn't it, Rudolph? The tradespeople\nwill refuse to trust us soon.\"\n\nInvoluntarily, Musgrave had seen the cheque. It was for a considerable\namount, and it was made out to John Charteris.\n\n\"Beyond doubt,\" said Musgrave, in his soul, \"Jack is colossal! He is\nactually drawing on his wife for the necessary expenses for running away\nwith another woman!\"\n\nThe colonel sat down abruptly before the great, open fireplace, and\nstared hard at the pine-boughs which were heaped up in it.\n\n\"A penny,\" said she, at length.\n\nHe glanced up with a smile. \"My dear madam, it would be robbery! For a\npenny, you may read of the subject of my thoughts in any of the yellow\njournals, only far more vividly set forth, and obtain a variety of more\nor less savory additions, to boot. I was thinking of the Lethbury case,\nand wondering how we could have been so long deceived by the man.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor Mrs. Lethbury!\" Anne sighed, \"I am very sorry for her,\nRudolph; she was a good woman, and was always interested in charitable\nwork.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Colonel Musgrave, with deliberation, \"it is she I\ncannot understand. To discover that he had been systematically\nhoodwinking her for some ten years; that, after making away with as much\nof her fortune as he was able to lay hands on, he has betrayed business\ntrust after business trust in order to--to maintain another\nestablishment; that he has never cared for her, and has made her his\ndupe time after time, in order to obtain money for his gambling debts\nand other even less reputable obligations--she must realize all these\nthings now, you know, and one would have thought no woman's love could\npossibly survive such a test. Yet, she is standing by him through thick\nand thin. Yes, I confess, Amelia Lethbury puzzles me. I don't understand\nher mental attitude.\"\n\nMusgrave was looking at Anne very intently as he ended.\n\n\"Why, but of course,\" said Anne, \"she realizes that it was all the fault\nof that--that other woman; and, besides, the--the entanglement has been\ngoing on only a little over eight years--not ten, Rudolph.\"\n\nShe was entirely in earnest; Colonel Musgrave could see it plainly.\n\n\"I admit I hadn't looked on it in that light,\" said he, at length, and\nwas silent for a moment Then, \"Upon my soul, Anne,\" he cried, \"I believe\nyou think the woman is only doing the natural thing, only doing the\nthing one has a right to expect of her, in sticking to that blackguard\nafter she has found him out!\"\n\nMrs. Charteris raised her eyebrows; she was really surprised.\n\"Naturally, she must stand by her husband when he is in trouble; why,\nif his own wife didn't, who would, Rudolph? It is just now that he needs\nher most. It would be abominable to desert him now.\"\n\nAnne paused and thought. \"Depend upon it, she knows a better side of his\nnature than we can see; she knows him, possibly, to have been misled, or\nto have acted thoughtlessly; because otherwise, she would not stand by\nhim so firmly.\" Having reached this satisfactory conclusion, Anne began\nto laugh--at Musgrave's lack of penetration, probably. \"So, you see,\nRudolph, in either case, her conduct is perfectly natural.\"\n\n\"And this,\" he cried, \"this is how women reason!\"\n\n\"Am I very stupid? Jack says I am a bit illogical at times. But,\nRudolph, you mustn't expect a woman to judge the man she loves; if you\ncall on her to do that, she doesn't reason about it; she just goes on\nloving him, and thinking how horrid you are. Women love men as they do\nchildren; they punish them sometimes, but only in deference to public\nopinion. A woman will always find an excuse for the man she loves. If he\ndeserts her, she is miserable until she succeeds in demonstrating to\nherself it was entirely her own fault; after that, she is properly\nrepentant, but far less unhappy; and, anyhow, she goes on loving him\njust the same.\"\n\nThe colonel pondered over this. \"Women are different,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know. I think that, if all women could be thrown with good\nmen, they would all be good. Women want to be good; but there comes a\ntime to each one of them when she wants to make a certain man happy, and\nwants that more than anything else in the world; and then, of course, if\nhe wants--very much--for her to be bad, she will be bad. A bad woman is\nalways to be explained by a bad man.\"\n\nAnne nodded, very wisely; then, she began to laugh, but this time at\nherself. \"I am talking quite like a book,\" she said. \"Really, I had no\nidea I was so clever. But I have thought of this before, Rudolph, and\nbeen sorry for those poor women who--who haven't found the right sort of\nman to care for.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Musgrave's face was alert. \"You have been luckier than most,\nAnne,\" he said.\n\n\"Lucky!\" she cried, and that queer little thrill of happiness woke again\nin her rich voice. \"Ah, you don't know how lucky I have been, Rudolph! I\nhave never cared for any one except--well, yes, you, a great while\nago--and Jack. And you are both good men. Ah, Rudolph, it was very dear\nand sweet and foolish, the way we loved each other, but you don't\nmind--very, very much--do you, if I think Jack is the best man in the\nworld, and by far the best man in the world for me? He is so good to me;\nhe is so good and kind and considerate to me, and, even after all these\nyears of matrimony, he is always the lover. A woman appreciates that,\nRudolph; she wants her husband to be always her lover, just as Jack is,\nand never to give in when she coaxes--because she only coaxes when she\nknows she is in the wrong--and never, never, to let her see him shaving\nhimself. If a husband observes these simple rules, Rudolph, his wife\nwill be a happy woman; and Jack does. In consequence, every day I live I\ngrow fonder of him, and appreciate him more and more; he grows upon me\njust as a taste for strong drink might. Without him--without him--\"\nAnne's voice died away; then she faced Musgrave, indignantly. \"Oh,\nRudolph!\" she cried, \"how horrid of you, how mean of you, to come here\nand suggest the possibility of Jack's dying or running away from me, or\ndoing anything dreadful like that!\"\n\nColonel Musgrave was smiling, \"I?\" said he, equably. \"My dear madam! if\nyou will reconsider,--\"\n\n\"No,\" she conceded, after deliberation, \"it wasn't exactly your fault. I\ngot started on the subject of Jack, and imagined all sorts of horrible\nand impossible things. But there is a sort of a something in the air\nto-night; probably a storm is coming down the river. So I feel very\nmorbid and very foolish, Rudolph; but, then, I am in love, you see.\nIsn't it funny, after all these years?\" Anne asked with a smile;--\"and\nso you are not to be angry, Rudolph.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"I assure you, the emotion you raise in me is very\nfar from resembling that of anger.\" Musgrave rose and laughed. \"I fear,\nyou know, we will create a scandal if we sit here any longer. Let's see\nwhat the others are doing.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThat night, after his guests had retired, Colonel Musgrave smoked a\ncigarette on the front porch of Matocton. The moon, now in the zenith,\nwas bright and chill. After a while, Musgrave raised his face toward it,\nand laughed.\n\n\"Isn't it--isn't it funny?\" he demanded, echoing Anne's query ruefully.\n\n\"Eh, well! perhaps I still retained some lingering hope; in a season of\ndiscomfort, most of us look vaguely for a miracle. And, at times, it\ncomes, but, more often, not; life isn't always a pantomime, with a fairy\ngod-mother waiting to break through the darkness in a burst of glory and\nreunite the severed lovers, and transform their enemies into pantaloons.\nIn this case, it is certain that the fairy will not come. I am condemned\nto be my own god in the machine.\"\n\nHaving demonstrated this to himself, Musgrave went into the house and\ndrugged his mind correcting proofsheets--for the _Lichfield Historical\nAssociation's Quarterly Magazine_--and brought down to the year 1805 his\n\"List of Wills Recorded in Brummell County.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe night was well advanced when Charteris stepped noiselessly into the\nroom. The colonel was then sedately writing amid a host of motionless\nmute watchers, for at Matocton most of the portraits hang in the East\nDrawing-room.\n\nThus, above the great marble mantel,--carved with thyrsi, and supported\nby proud deep-bosomed caryatides,--you will find burly Sebastian\nMusgrave, \"the Speaker,\" an all-overbearing man even on canvas. \"Paint\nme among dukes and earls with my hat on, to show I am in all things a\nRepublican, and the finest diamond in the Colony shall be yours,\" he had\ndirected the painter, and this was done. Then there is frail Wilhelmina\nMusgrave--that famed beauty whose two-hundred-year-old story all\nLichfield knows, and no genealogist has ever cared to detail--eternally\nweaving flowers about her shepherd hat. There, too, is Evelyn Ramsay,\nbefore whose roguish loveliness, as you may remember, the colonel had\nsnapped his fingers in those roseate days when he so joyously considered\nhis profound unworthiness to be Patricia's husband. There is also the\ncolonial governor of Albemarle--a Van Dyck this--two Knellers, and\nLely's portrait of Thomas Musgrave, \"the poet,\" with serious blue eyes\nand flaxen hair. The painting of Captain George Musgrave, who\ndistinguished himself at the siege of Cartagena, is admittedly an\ninferior piece of work, but it has vigor, none the less; and below it\nhangs the sword which was presented to him by the Lord High Admiral.\n\nSo quietly did Charteris come that the colonel was not aware of his\nentrance until the novelist had coughed gently. He was in a\ndressing-gown, and looked unusually wizened.\n\n\"I saw your light,\" he said. \"I don't seem to be able to sleep, somehow.\nIt is so infernally hot and still. I suppose there is going to be a\nthunderstorm. I hate thunderstorms. They frighten me.\" The little man\nwas speaking like a peevish child.\n\n\"Oh, well--! it will at least clear the air,\" said Rudolph Musgrave.\n\"Sit down and have a smoke, won't you?\"\n\n\"No, thanks.\" Charteris had gone to the bookshelves and was gently\npushing and pulling at the books so as to arrange their backs in a\nmathematically straight line. \"I thought I would borrow something to\nread--Why, this is the Tennyson you had at college, isn't it? Yes, I\nremember it perfectly.\"\n\nThese two had roomed together through their college days.\n\n\"Yes; it is the old Tennyson. And yonder is the identical Swinburne you\nused to spout from, too. Lord, Jack, it seems a century since I used to\nlisten by the hour to _The Triumph of Time and Dolores!_\"\n\n\"Ah, but you didn't really care for them--not even then.\" Charteris\nreached up, his back still turned, and moved a candlestick the fraction\nof an inch. \"There is something so disgustingly wholesome about you,\nRudolph. And it appears to be ineradicable. I can't imagine how I ever\ncame to be fond of you.\"\n\nThe colonel was twirling his pen, his eyes intent upon it. \"And yet--we\n_were_ fond of each other, weren't we, Jack?\"\n\n\"Why, I positively adored you. You were such a strong and healthy\nanimal. Upon my word, I don't believe I ever missed a single football\ngame you played in. In fact, I almost learned to understand the game on\nyour account. You see--it was so good to watch you raging about with\ntouzled hair, like the only original bull of Bashan, and the others\ntumbling like ninepins. It used to make me quite inordinately proud.\"\n\nThe colonel smoked. \"But, Lord! how proud _I_ was when you got medals!\"\n\n\"Yes--I remember.\"\n\n\"Even if I did bully you sometimes. Remember how I used to twist your\narm to make you write my Latin exercises, Jack?\"\n\n\"I liked to have you do that,\" Charteris said, simply. \"It hurt a great\ndeal, but I liked it.\"\n\nHe had come up behind the colonel, who was still seated. \"Yes, that was\na long while ago,\" said Charteris. \"It is rather terrible--isn't it?--to\nreflect precisely how long ago it was. Why, I shall be bald in a year or\ntwo from now. But you have kept almost all your beautiful hair,\nRudolph.\"\n\nCharteris touched the colonel's head, stroking his hair ever so lightly\nonce or twice. It was in effect a caress.\n\nThe colonel was aware of the odor of myrrh which always accompanied\nCharteris and felt that the little man was trembling.\n\n\"Isn't there--anything you want to tell me, Jack?\" the colonel said. He\nsat quite still.\n\nThere was the tiniest pause. The caressing finger-tips lifted from\nMusgrave's head, but presently gave it one more brief and half-timid\ntouch.\n\n\"Why, only _au revoir_, I believe. I am leaving at a rather ungodly hour\nto-morrow and won't see you, but I hope to return within the week.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Jack.\"\n\n\"And, after all, it is too late to be reading. I shall go back to bed\nand take more trional. And then, I dare say, I shall sleep. So good-by,\nRudolph.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Jack.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--! I meant good-night, of course.\"\n\nThe colonel sighed; then he spoke abruptly:\n\n\"No, just a moment, Jack. I didn't ask you to come here to-night; but\nsince you have come, by chance, I am going to follow the promptings of\nthat chance, and strike a blow for righteousness with soiled weapons.\nJack, do you remember suggesting that my father's correspondence during\nthe War might be of value, and that his desk ought to be overhauled?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, of course. Mrs. Musgrave was telling me she began the task,\"\nsaid Charteris, and smiled a little.\n\n\"Unluckily; yes--but--well! in any event, it suggested to me that old\nletters are dangerous. I really had no idea what that desk contained. My\nfather had preserved great stacks of letters. I have been going through\nthem. They were most of them from women--letters which should never have\nbeen written in the first place, and which he certainly had no right to\nkeep.\"\n\n\"What! and is 'Wild Will's' love-correspondence still extant? I fancy it\nmade interesting reading, Rudolph.\"\n\n\"There were some letters which in a measure concern you, Jack.\" The\ncolonel handed him a small packet of letters. \"If you will read the top\none it will explain. I will just go on with my writing.\"\n\nHe wrote steadily for a moment or two.... Then Charteris laughed\nmusically.\n\n\"I have always known there was a love-affair between my mother and 'Wild\nWill.' But I never suspected until to-night that I had the honor to be\nyour half-brother, Rudolph--one of 'Wild Will's' innumerable bastards.\"\nCharteris was pallid, and though he seemed perfectly composed, his eyes\nglittered as with gusty brilliancies. \"I understand now why my reputed\nfather always made such a difference between my sister and myself. I\nnever liked old Alvin Charteris, you know. It is a distinct relief to be\ninformed I have no share in his blood, although of course the knowledge\ncomes a trifle suddenly.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I should have kept that knowledge to myself. I know it would\nhave been kinder. I had meant to be kind. I loathe myself for dabbling\nin this mess. But, in view of all things, it seemed necessary to let you\nknow I am your own brother in the flesh, and that Patricia is your\nbrother's wife.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Charteris. \"According to your standards that would make a\ngreat difference. I don't know, speaking frankly, that it makes much\ndifference with me.\" He turned again to the bookshelves, so that\nMusgrave could no longer see his face. Charteris ran his fingers\ncaressingly over the backs of a row of volumes. \"I loved my mother,\nRudolph. I never loved anyone else. That makes a difference.\" Then he\nsaid, \"We Musgraves--how patly I catalogue myself already!--we Musgraves\nhave a deal to answer for, Rudolph.\"\n\n\"And doesn't that make it all the more our duty to live clean and honest\nlives? to make the debt no greater than it is?\" Both men were oddly\nquiet.\n\n\"Eh, I am not so sure.\" John Charteris waved airily toward Sebastian\nMusgrave's counterfeit, then toward the other portraits. \"It was they\nwho compounded our inheritances, Rudolph--all that we were to have in\nthis world of wit and strength and desire and endurance. We know their\nhistories. They were proud, brave and thriftless, a greedy and lecherous\nrace, who squeezed life dry as one does an orange, and left us the\ndregs. I think that it is droll, but I am not sure it places us under\nany obligation. In fact, I rather think God owes us an apology,\nRudolph.\"\n\nHe spoke with quaint wistfulness. The colonel sat regarding him in\nsilence, with shocked, disapproving eyes. Then Charteris cocked his head\nto one side and grinned like a hobgoblin.\n\n\"What wouldn't you give,\" he demanded, \"to know what I am really\nthinking of at this very moment while I talk so calmly? Well, you will\nnever know. And for the rest, you are at liberty to use your\nall-important documents as you may elect. I am John Charteris; whatever\nman begot my body, he is rotten bones to-day, and it is as such I value\nhim. I was never anybody's son--or friend or brother or lover,--but just\na pen that someone far bigger and far nobler than John Charteris writes\nwith occasionally. Whereas you--but, oh, you are funny, Rudolph!\" And\nthen, \"Good-night, dear brother,\" Charteris added, sweetly, as he left\nthe room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Rudolph Musgrave could not quite believe in the actuality of what\nhad just happened. In common with most of us, he got his general notions\nconcerning the laws of life from reading fiction; and here was the\nmaterial for a Renaissance tragedy wasted so far as any d\u00e9nouement went.\nDestiny, once more, was hardly rising to the possibilities of the\nsituation. The weapon chance had forged had failed Rudolph Musgrave\nutterly; and, indeed, he wondered now how he could ever have esteemed it\nformidable. Jack was his half-brother. In noveldom or in a melodrama\nthis discovery would have transformed their mutual dealings; but as a\nworkaday world's fact, Musgrave would not honestly say that it had in\nany way affected his feelings toward Jack, and it appeared to have left\nCharteris equally unaltered.\n\n\"I am not sure, though. We can only guess where Jack is concerned. He\ngoes his own way always, tricky and furtive and lonelier than any other\nhuman being I have ever known. It is loneliness that looks out of his\neyes, really, even when he is mocking and sneering,\" the colonel\nmeditated.\n\nThen he sighed and went back to the tabulation of his lists of wills.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe day was growing strong in the maple-grove behind Matocton. As yet,\nthe climbing sun fired only the topmost branches, and flooded them with\na tempered radiance through which birds plunged and shrilled vague\nrumors to one another. Beneath, a green twilight lingered--twilight\nwhich held a gem-like glow, chill and lucent and steady as that of an\nemerald. Vagrant little puffs of wind bustled among the leaves, with a\nthin pretense of purpose, and then lapsed, and merged in the large,\nambiguous whispering which went stealthily about the grove.\n\nRudolph Musgrave sat on a stone beside the road that winds through the\nwoods toward the railway station, and smoked, nervously. He was\ndisheartened of the business of living, and, absurdly enough, as it\nseemed to him, he was hungry.\n\n\"It has to be done quietly and without the remotest chance of Anne's\never hearing of it, and without the remotest chance of its ever having\nto be done again. I have about fifteen minutes in which to convince\nPatricia both of her own folly and of the fact that Jack is an\nunmitigated cad, and to get him off the place quietly, so that Anne will\nsuspect nothing. And I never knew any reasonable argument to appeal to\nPatricia, and Jack will be a cornered rat! Yes, it is a large contract,\nand I would give a great deal--a very great deal--to know how I am going\nto fulfil it.\"\n\nAt this moment his wife and Mr. Charteris, carrying two portmanteaux,\ncame around a bend in the road not twenty feet from Musgrave. They were\nboth rather cross. In the clean and more prosaic light of morning an\nelopement seemed almost silly; moreover, Patricia had had no breakfast,\nand Charteris had been much annoyed by his wife, who had breakfasted\nwith him, and had insisted on driving to the station with him. It was a\ntrivial-seeming fact, but, perhaps, not unworthy of notice, that\nPatricia was carrying her own portmanteau, as well as an umbrella.\n\nThe three faced one another in the cool twilight. The woods stirred\nlazily about them. The birds were singing on a wager now.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"so you have come at last. I have been\nexpecting you for some time.\"\n\nPatricia dropped her portmanteau, sullenly. Mr. Charteris placed his\nwith care to the side of the road, and said, \"Oh!\" It was perhaps the\nonly observation that occurred to him.\n\n\"Patricia,\" Musgrave began, very kindly and very gravely, \"you are\nabout to do a foolish thing. At the bottom of your heart, even now, you\nknow you are about to do a foolish thing--a thing you will regret\nbitterly and unavailingly for the rest of time. You are turning your\nback on the world--our world--on the one possible world you could ever\nbe happy in. You can't be happy in the half-world, Patricia; you aren't\nthat sort. But you can never come back to us then, Patricia; it doesn't\nmatter what the motive was, what the temptation was, or how great the\nrepentance is--you cannot ever return. That is the law, Patricia;\nperhaps, it isn't always a just law. We didn't make it, you and I, but\nit is the law, and we must obey it. Our world merely says that, leaving\nit once, you cannot ever return: such is the only punishment it awards\nyou, for it knows, this wise old world of ours, that such is the\nbitterest punishment which could ever be devised for you. Our world has\nmade you what you are; in every thought and ideal and emotion you\npossess, you are a product of our world. You couldn't live in the\nhalf-world, Patricia; you are a product of our world that can never take\nroot in that alien soil. Come back to us before it is too late,\nPatricia!\"\n\nMusgrave shook himself all over, rather like a Newfoundland dog coming\nout of the water, and the grave note died from his voice. He smiled, and\nrubbed his hands together.\n\n\"And now,\" said he, \"I will stop talking like a problem play, and we\nwill say no more about it. Give me your portmanteau, my dear, and upon\nmy word of honor, you will never hear a word further from me in the\nmatter. Jack, here, can take the train, just as he intended. And--and\nyou and I will go back to the house, and have a good, hot breakfast\ntogether. Eh, Patricia?\"\n\nShe was thinking, unreasonably enough, how big and strong and clean her\nhusband looked in the growing light. It was a pity Jack was so small.\nHowever, she faced Musgrave coldly, and thought how ludicrously wide of\nthe mark were all these threats of ostracism. She shudderingly wished he\nwould not talk of soil and taking root and hideous things like that, but\notherwise the colonel left her unmoved. He was certainly good-looking,\nthough.\n\nCharteris was lighting a cigarette, with a queer, contented look. He\nknew the value of Patricia's stubbornness now; still, he appeared to be\nusing an unnecessary number of matches.\n\n\"I should have thought you would have perceived the lack of dignity, as\nwell as the utter uselessness, in making such a scene,\" Patricia said.\n\"We aren't suited for each other, Rudolph; and it is better--far better\nfor both of us--to have done with the farce of pretending to be. I am\nsorry that you still care for me. I didn't know that. But, for the\nfuture, I intend to live my own life.\"\n\nPatricia's voice faltered, and she stretched out her hands a little\ntoward her husband in an odd gust of friendliness. He looked so kind;\nand he was not smiling in that way she never liked. \"Surely that isn't\nso unpardonable a crime, Rudolph?\" she asked, almost humbly.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" he answered, \"it is not unpardonable--it is impossible.\nYou can't lead your own life, Patricia; none of us can. Each life is\nbound up with many others, and every rash act of yours, every hasty word\nof yours, must affect to some extent the lives of those who are nearest\nand most dear to you. But, oh, it is not argument that I would be at!\nPatricia, there was a woman once--She was young, and wealthy, and--ah,\nwell, I won't deceive you by exaggerating her personal attractions! I\nwill serve up to you no praises of her sauced with lies. But fate and\nnature had combined to give her everything a woman can desire, and all\nthis that woman freely gave to me--to me who hadn't youth or wealth or\nfame or anything! And I can't stand by, for that dear dead girl's sake,\nand watch your life go wrong, Patricia!\"\n\n\"You are just like the rest of them, Olaf\"--and when had she used that\nhalf-forgotten nickname last, he wondered. \"You imagine you are in love\nwith a girl because you happen to like the color of her eyes, or because\nthere is a curve about her lips that appeals to you. That isn't love,\nOlaf, as we women understand it.\"\n\nAnd wildly hideous and sad, it seemed to Colonel Musgrave--this dreary\nparody of their old love-talk. Only, he dimly knew that she had\nforgotten John Charteris existed, and that to her this moment seemed no\nless sardonic.\n\nCharteris inhaled, lazily; yet, he did not like the trembling about\nPatricia's mouth. Her hands, too, opened and shut tight before she\nspoke.\n\n\"It is too late now,\" she said, dully. \"I gave you all there was to\ngive. You gave me just what Grandma Pendomer and all the others had left\nyou able to give. That remnant isn't love, Olaf, as we women understand\nit. And, anyhow, it is too late now.\"\n\nYet Patricia was remembering a time when Rudolph's voice held always\nthat grave, tender note in speaking to her; it seemed a great while ago.\nAnd he was big and manly, just like his voice, Rudolph was; and he\nlooked very kind. Desperately, Patricia began to count over the times\nher husband had offended her. Hadn't he talked to her in the most\nunwarrantable manner only yesterday afternoon?\n\n\"Too late!--oh, not a bit of it!\" Musgrave cried. His voice sank\npersuasively. \"Why, Patricia, you are only thinking the matter over for\nthe first time. You have only begun to think of it. Why, there is the\nboy--our boy, Patricia! Surely, you hadn't thought of Roger?\"\n\nHe had found the right chord at last. It quivered and thrilled under his\ntouch; and the sense of mastery leaped in his blood. Of a sudden, he\nknew himself dominant. Her face was red, then white, and her eyes\nwavered before the blaze of his, that held her, compellingly.\n\n\"Now, honestly, just between you and me,\" the colonel said,\nconfidentially, \"was there ever a better and braver and quainter and\nhandsomer boy in the world? Why, Patricia, surely, you wouldn't\nwillingly--of your own accord--go away from him, and never see him\nagain? Oh, you haven't thought, I tell you! Think, Patricia! Don't you\nremember that first day, when I came into your room at the hospital and\nhe--ah, how wrinkled and red and old-looking he was then, wasn't he,\nlittle wife? Don't you remember how he was lying on your breast, and how\nI took you both in my arms, and held you close for a moment, and how for\na long, long while there wasn't anything left of the whole wide world\nexcept just us three and God smiling down upon us? Don't you remember,\nPatricia? Don't you remember his first tooth--why, we were as proud of\nhim, you and I, as if there had never been a tooth before in all the\nhistory of the world! Don't you remember the first day he walked? Why,\nhe staggered a great distance--oh, nearly two yards!--and caught hold of\nmy hand, and laughed and turned back--to you. You didn't run away from\nhim then, Patricia. Are you going to do it now?\"\n\nShe struggled under his look. She had an absurd desire to cry, just that\nhe might console her. She knew he would. Why was it so hard to remember\nthat she hated Rudolph! Of course, she hated him; she loved that other\nman yonder. His name was Jack. She turned toward Charteris, and the\nreassuring smile with which he greeted her, impressed Patricia as being\nsingularly nasty. She hated both of them; she wanted--in that brief time\nwhich remained for having anything--only her boy, her soft, warm little\nRoger who had eyes like Rudolph's.\n\n\"I--I--it's too late, Rudolph,\" she stammered, parrot-like. \"If you had\nonly taken better care of me, Rudolph! If--No, it's too late, I tell\nyou! You will be kind to Roger. I am only weak and frivolous and\nheartlesss. I am not fit to be his mother. I'm not fit, Rudolph!\nRudolph, I tell you I'm not fit! Ah, let me go, my dear!--in mercy, let\nme go! For I haven't loved the boy as I ought to, and I am afraid to\nlook you in the face, and you won't let me take my eyes away--you won't\nlet me! Ah, Rudolph, let me go!\"\n\n\"Not fit?\" His voice thrilled with strength, and pulsed with tender\ncadences. \"Ah, Patricia, I am not fit to be his father! But, between\nus--between us, mightn't we do much for him? Come back to us,\nPatricia--to me and the boy! We need you, my dear. Ah, I am only a\nstolid, unattractive fogy, I know; but you loved me once, and--I am the\nfather of your child. My standards are out-of-date, perhaps, and in any\nevent they are not your standards, and that difference has broken many\nties between us; but I am the father of your child. You must--you _must_\ncome back to me and the boy!\" Musgrave caught her face between his\nhands, and lifted it toward his. \"Patricia, don't make any mistake!\nThere is nothing you care for so much as that boy. You can't give him\nup! If you had to walk over red-hot ploughshares to come to him, you\nwould do it; if you could win him a moment's happiness by a lifetime of\npoverty and misery and degradation, you would do it. And so would I,\nlittle wife. That is the tie which still unites us; that is the tie\nwhich is too strong ever to break. Come back to us, Patricia--to me and\nthe boy.\"\n\n\"I--Jack, Jack, take me away!\" she wailed helplessly.\n\nCharteris came forward with a smile. He was quite sure of Patricia now.\n\n\"Colonel Musgrave,\" he said, with a faint drawl, \"if you have entirely\nfinished your edifying and, I assure you, highly entertaining monologue,\nI will ask you to excuse us. I--oh, man, man!\" Charteris cried, not\nunkindly, \"don't you see it is the only possible outcome?\"\n\nMusgrave faced him. The glow of hard-earned victory was pulsing in the\ncolonel's blood, but his eyes were chill stars. \"Now, Jack,\" he said,\nequably, \"I am going to talk to you. In fact, I am going to discharge an\nagreeable duty toward you.\"\n\nMusgrave drew close to him. Charteris shrugged his shoulders; his smile,\nhowever, was not entirely satisfactory. It did not suggest enjoyment.\n\n\"I don't blame you for being what you are,\" Musgrave went on, curtly.\n\"You were born so, doubtless. I don't blame a snake for being what it\nis. But, when I see a snake, I claim the right to set my foot on its\nhead; when I see a man like you--well, this is the right I claim.\"\n\nThereupon Rudolph Musgrave struck his half-brother in the face with his\nopen hand. The colonel was a strong man, physically, and, on this\noccasion, he made no effort to curb his strength.\n\n\"Now,\" Musgrave concluded, \"you are going away from this place very\nquickly, and you are going alone. You will do this because I tell you to\ndo so, and because you are afraid of me. Understand, also--if you will\nbe so good--that the only reason I don't give you a thorough thrashing\nis that I don't think you are worth the trouble. I only want Patricia to\nperceive exactly what sort of man you are.\"\n\nThe blow staggered Charteris. He seemed to grow smaller. His clothes\nseemed to hang more loosely about him. His face was paper-white, and the\nred mark showed plainly upon it.\n\n\"There would be no earthly sense in my hitting you back,\" he said\nequably. \"It would only necessitate my getting the thrashing which, I\ncan assure you, we are equally anxious to avoid. Of course you are able\nto knock me down and so on, because you are nearly twice as big as I am.\nI fail to see that proves anything in particular. Come, Patricia!\" And\nhe turned to her, and reached out his hand.\n\nShe shrank from him. She drew away from him, without any vehemence, as\nif he had been some slimy, harmless reptile. A woman does not like to\nsee fear in a man's eyes; and there was fear in Mr. Charteris's eyes,\nfor all that he smiled. Patricia's heart sickened. She loathed him, and\nshe was a little sorry for him.\n\n\"Oh, you cur, you cur!\" she gasped, in a wondering whisper. Patricia\nwent to her husband, and held out her hands. She was afraid of him. She\nwas proud of him, the strong animal. \"Take me away, Rudolph,\" she said,\nsimply; \"take me away from that--that coward. Take me away, my dear. You\nmay beat me, too, if you like, Rudolph. I dare say I have deserved it.\nBut I want you to deal brutally with me, to carry me away by force, just\nas you threatened to do the day we were married--at the Library, you\nremember, when the man was crying 'Fresh oranges!' and you smelt so\ndeliciously of soap and leather and cigarette smoke.\"\n\nMusgrave took both her hands in his. He smiled at Charteris.\n\nThe novelist returned the smile, intensifying its sweetness. \"I fancy,\nRudolph,\" he said, \"that, after all, I shall have to take that train\nalone.\"\n\nMr. Charteris continued, with a grimace: \"You have no notion, though,\nhow annoying it is not to possess an iota of what is vulgarly considered\nmanliness. But what am I to do? I was not born with the knack of\nenduring physical pain. Oh, yes, I am a coward, if you like to put it\nnakedly; but I was born so, willy-nilly. Personally, if I had been\nconsulted in the matter, I would have preferred the usual portion of\nvalor. However! the sanctity of the hearth has been most edifyingly\npreserved--and, after all, the woman is not worth squabbling about.\"\n\nThere was exceedingly little of the mountebank in him now; he kicked\nPatricia's portmanteau, frankly and viciously, as he stepped over it to\nlift his own. Holding this in one hand, John Charteris spoke, honestly:\n\n\"Rudolph, I had a trifle underrated your resources. For you are a brave\nman--we physical cowards, you know, admire that above all things--and a\nstrong man and a clever man, in that you have adroitly played upon the\npurely brutal traits of women. Any she-animal clings to its young and\nlooks for protection in its mate. Upon a higher ground I would have\nbeaten you, but as an animal you are my superior. Still, a thing done\nhas an end. You have won back your wife in open fight. I fancy, by the\nway, that you have rather laid up future trouble for yourself in doing\nso, but I honor the skill you have shown. Colonel Musgrave, it is to you\nthat, as the vulgar phrase it, I take off my hat.\"\n\nThereupon, Mr. Charteris uncovered his head with perfect gravity, and\nturned on his heel, and went down the road, whistling melodiously.\n\nMusgrave stared after him, for a while. The lust of victory died; the\ntumult and passion and fervor were gone from Musgrave's soul. He could\nvery easily imagine the things Jack Charteris would say to Anne\nconcerning him; and the colonel knew that she would believe them all. He\nhad won the game; he had played it, heartily and skilfully and\nsuccessfully; and his reward was that the old bickerings with Patricia\nshould continue, and that Anne should be taught to loathe him. He\nforesaw it all very plainly as he stood, hand in hand with his wife.\n\nBut Anne would be happy. It was for that he had played.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThey came back to Matocton almost silently. The spell of the dawn was\nbroken; it was honest, garish day now, and they were both hungry.\n\nPatricia's spirits were rising, as a butterfly's might after a\nthunderstorm. Since she had only a few months to live, she would at\nleast not waste them in squabbling. She would be conscientiously\nagreeable to everybody.\n\n\"Ah, Rudolph, Rudolph!\" she cooed, \"if I had only known all along that\nyou loved me!\"\n\n\"My dear,\" he protested, fondly, \"it seemed such a matter of course.\" He\nwas a little tired, perhaps; the portmanteau seemed very heavy.\n\n\"A woman likes to be told--a woman likes to be told every day.\nOtherwise, she forgets,\" Patricia murmured. Then her face grew tenderly\nreproachful. \"Ah, Rudolph, Rudolph, see what your carelessness and\nneglect has nearly led to! It nearly led to my running away with a man\nlike--like that! It would have been all your fault, Rudolph, if I had.\nYou know it would have been, Rudolph.\"\n\nAnd Patricia sighed once more, and then laughed and became magnanimous.\n\n\"Yes--yes, after all, you are the boy's father.\" She smiled up at him\nkindly and indulgently. \"I forgive you, Rudolph,\" said Patricia.\n\nHe must have shown that pardon from Patricia just now was not unflavored\nwith irony, for she continued, in another voice: \"Who, after all, is the\none human being you love? You know that it's the boy, and just the boy\nalone. I gave you that boy. You should remember that, I think--\"\n\n\"I do remember it, Patricia--\"\n\n\"I bore the child. I paid the price, not you,\" Patricia said, very\nquiet. \"No, I don't mean the price all women have to pay--\" She paused\nin their leisurely progress, and drew vague outlines in the roadway with\nthe ferrule of her umbrella before she looked up into Rudolph Musgrave's\nface. She appraised it for a long while and quite as if her husband were\na stranger.\n\n\"Yes, I could make you very sorry for me, if I wanted to.\" Her thoughts\nran thus. \"But what's the use? You could only become an interminable\nnuisance in trying to soothe my dying hours. You have just obstinately\nsquatted around in Lichfield and devoted all your time to being\nbeautiful and good and mooning around women for I don't know how many\nyears. You make me tired, and I have half a mind to tell you so right\nnow. And there really is no earthly sense in attempting to explain\nthings to you. You have so got into the habit of being beautiful and\ngood that you are capable of quoting Scripture after I have finished.\nThen I would assuredly box your jaws, because I don't yearn to be a poor\nstricken dear and weep on anybody's bosom. And I don't particularly care\nabout your opinion of me, anyway.\"\n\nAloud she said: \"Oh, well! let's go and get some breakfast.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nAnd thus the situation stayed. Patricia told him nothing. And Rudolph\nMusgrave, knowing that according to his lights he had behaved not\nunhandsomely, was the merest trifle patronizing and rather like a person\nspeaking from a superior plane in his future dealings with Patricia.\nMoreover, he was engrossed at this time by his scholarly compilation of\nLichfield Legislative Papers prior to 1800, which was printed the\nfollowing February.\n\nShe told him nothing. She was a devoted mother for two days' space, and\nthen candidly decided that Roger was developing into the most\ninsufferable of little prigs.\n\n\"And, besides, if he had never been born I would quite probably have\nlived to keep my teeth in a glass of water at night. And I can't help\nthinking of that privilege being denied me whenever I look at him.\"\n\nShe told Rudolph Musgrave nothing. She was finding it mildly amusing to\nnote how people came and went at Matocton, and to appraise these people\ndisinterestedly, because she would never see them again.\n\nPatricia was drawing her own conclusions as to Lichfield's aristocracy.\nThese people--for the most part a preposterously handsome race--were the\npleasantest of companions and their manners were perfection; but there\nwas enough of old Roger Stapylton's blood in Patricia's veins to make\nher feel, however obscurely, that nobody is justified in living without\neven an attempt at any personal achievement. The younger men evinced a\nmarked tendency to leave Lichfield, to make their homes elsewhere, she\nnoted, and they very often attained prominence; there was Joe Parkinson,\nfor instance, who had lunched at Oyster Bay only last Thursday,\naccording to the _Lichfield Courier-Herald_. And, meanwhile, the men of\nher husband's generation clung to their old mansions, and were\nornamental, certainly, and were, very certainly, profoundly\nself-satisfied; for they adhered to the customs of yesterday under the\ncomfortable delusion that this was the only way to uphold yesterday's\nideals. But what, in heaven's name, had any of these men of Rudolph\nMusgrave's circle ever done beyond enough perfunctory desk-work, say, to\nfurnish him food and clothes?\n\n\"A hamlet of Hamlets,\" was Patricia's verdict as to Lichfield--\"whose\nactual tragedy isn't that their fathers were badly treated, but that\nthey themselves are constitutionally unable to do anything except talk\nabout how badly their fathers were treated.\"\n\nNo, it was not altogether that these men were indolent. Rudolph and\nRudolph's peers had been reared in the belief that when any manual labor\nbecame inevitable, you as a matter of course entrusted its execution to\na negro; and, forced themselves to labor, they not unnaturally complied\nwith an ever-present sense of unfair treatment, and, in consequence,\nperformed the work inefficiently. Lichfield had no doubt preserved a\ncomely manner of living; but it had produced in the last half-century\nnothing of real importance except John Charteris.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nFor Charteris was important. Patricia was rereading all the books that\nCharteris had published, and they engrossed her with an augmenting\nadmiration.\n\nBut it is unnecessary to dilate upon the marvelous and winning pictures\nof life in Lichfield before the War between the States which Charteris\nhas painted in his novels. \"Even as the king of birds that with\nunwearied wing soars nearest to the sun, yet wears upon his breast the\nsoftest down,\"--as we learn from no less eminent authority than that of\nthe _Lichfield Courier-Herald_--\"so Mr. Charteris is equally expert in\ndepicting the derring-do and tenderness of those glorious days of\nchivalry, of fair women and brave men, of gentle breeding, of splendid\nculture and wholesome living.\"\n\nPatricia was not a little puzzled by these books. The traditional\nLichfield, she decided in the outcome, may very possibly have been just\nthe trick-work of a charlatan's cleverness; but, even in that event,\nhere were the tales of life in Lichfield--ardent, sumptuous and\nfragrant throughout with the fragrance of love and roses, of rhyme and\nof youth's lovely fallacies; and for the pot-pourri, if it deserved no\nhigher name, all who believed that living ought to be a uniformly noble\ntransaction could not fail to be grateful eternally.\n\nEsthetic values apart--and, indeed, to all such values Patricia accorded\na provisional respect--what most impressed her Stapyltonian mind was the\nfact that these books represented, in a perfectly tangible way, success.\nPatricia very heartily admired success when it was brevetted as such by\nthe applause of others. And while to be a noted stylist, and even to be\nreasonably sure of annotated reissuement for the plaguing of unborn\nschoolchildren, was all well enough, in an unimportant, high-minded way,\nPatricia was far more vividly impressed by the blunt figures which told\nhow many of John Charteris's books had been bought and paid for. She\naccepted these figures as his publishers gave them forth, implicitly;\nand she marveled over and took odd joy in these figures. They enabled\nher to admire Charteris's books without reservation.\n\nBy this time Mrs. Ashmeade had managed, in the most natural manner, to\ntell Patricia a deal concerning Charteris. No halo graced the portrait\nMrs. Ashmeade painted.... But, indeed, Patricia now viewed John\nCharteris, considered as a person, without any particular bias. She did\nnot especially care--now--what the man had done or had omitted to do.\n\nBut the venerable incongruity of the writer and his work confronted her\nintriguingly. A Charteris writes _In Old Lichfield;_ a Cockney\ndrug-clerk writes _The Eve of St. Agnes;_ a genteel printer evolves a\nLovelace; and a cutpurse pens the _Ballad of Dead Ladies_ in a brothel.\nIt is manifestly impossible; and it happens.\n\nSo here, then, was a knave who held, somehow, the keys to a courtlier\nand nobler world. These tales made living seem a braver business, for\nall that they were written by a poltroon. Was it pure posturing?\nPatricia, at least, thought it was not. At worst, such dexterous\nmaintenance of a pose was hardly despicable, she considered. And,\nanyhow, she preferred to believe that Charteris had by some miracle put\nthe best of himself into these books, had somehow clarified the\nabhorrent mixture of ability and evil which was John Charteris; and the\nbest in him she found, on this hypothesis, to be a deal more admirable\nthan the best in Rudolph Musgrave.\n\n\"It _is_ a part of Jack,\" she fiercely said. \"It is, because I know it\nis. All this is part of him--as much a part of him as the cowardice and\nthe trickery. So I don't really care if he is a liar and a coward. I\nought to, I suppose. But at the bottom of my heart I admire him. He has\nmade something; he has created these beautiful books, and they will be\nhere when we are all dead. He doesn't leave the world just as he found\nit. That is the only real cowardice, I think--especially as I am going\nto do it----\"\n\nAnd later she said, belligerently: \"If I had been a man I could have at\nleast assassinated somebody who was prominent. I do wish Rudolph was\nnot such a stick-in-the-mud. And I wish I liked Rudolph better. But on\nthe whole I prefer the physical coward to the moral one. Rudolph simply\nbores me stiff with his benevolent airs. He just walks around the place\nforgiving me sixty times to the hour, and if he doesn't stop it I am\ngoing to slap him.\"\n\nThus Patricia.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThe world knows how Charteris was killed in Fairhaven by Jasper\nHardress--the husband of \"that flighty Mrs. Hardress\" Anne had spoken\nof.\n\n\"And I hardly know,\" said Mrs. Ashmeade, \"whether more to admire the\njustice or the sardonic humor of the performance. Here after hundreds of\nentanglements with women, John Charteris manages to be shot by a jealous\nmaniac on account of a woman with whom--for a wonder--his relations were\nproven to be innocent. The man needed killing, but it is asking too much\nof human nature to put up with his being made a martyr of.\"\n\nShe cried a little, though. \"It--it's because I remember him when he was\nturning out his first mustache,\" she explained, lucidly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut with the horror and irony of John Charteris's assassination the\nbiographer of Rudolph Musgrave has really nothing to do save in so far\nas this event influenced the life of Rudolph Musgrave.\n\nIt was on the day of Charteris's death--a fine, clear afternoon in late\nSeptember--that Rudolph Musgrave went bass-fishing with some eight of\nhis masculine guests. Luncheon was brought to them in a boat about two\no'clock, along with the day's mail.\n\n\"I say--! But listen, everybody!\" cried Alfred Chayter, whose mail\nincluded a morning paper--the _Lichfield Courier-Herald_, in fact.\n\nHe read aloud.\n\n\"I wish I could be with Anne,\" thought Colonel Musgrave. \"It may be I\ncould make things easier.\"\n\nBut Anne was in Lichfield now....\n\nHe had just finished dressing for supper when it occurred to him that\nsince their return from the river he had not seen Patricia. He was\nafraid that Patricia, also, would be upset by this deplorable news.\n\nAs he crossed the hall Virginia came out of Patricia's rooms. The\ncolonel raised his voice in speaking to her, for with age Virginia was\ngrowing very deaf.\n\n\"Yaas, suh,\" she said, \"I'm doin' middlin' well, suh, thank yeh, suh.\nJus' took the evenin' mail to Miss Patricy, like I always do, suh.\" She\nwent away quietly, her pleasant yellow face as imperturbable as an\nidol's.\n\nHe went into Patricia's bedroom. Patricia had been taking an afternoon\nnap, and had not risen from the couch, where she lay with three or four\nunopened letters upon her breast. Two she had opened and dropped upon\nthe floor. She seemed not to hear him when he spoke her name, and yet\nshe was not asleep, because her eyes were partly unclosed.\n\nThere was no purple glint in them, as once there had been always. Her\ncountenance, indeed, showed everywhere less brightly tinted than\nnormally it should be. Her heavy copper-colored hair, alone undimmed,\nseemed, like some parasitic growth (he thought), to sustain its beauty\nby virtue of having drained Patricia's body of color and vitality.\n\nThere was a newspaper in her right hand, with flamboyant headlines,\nbecause to Lichfield the death of John Charteris was an event of\nimportance.\n\nPatricia seemed very young. You saw that she had suffered. You knew it\nwas not fair to hurt a child like that.\n\nBut, indeed, Rudolph Musgrave hardly realized as yet that Patricia was\ndead. For Colonel Musgrave was thinking of that time when this same\nPatricia had first come to him, fire-new from the heart of an ancient\nsunset, and he had noted, for the first time, that her hair was like the\nreflection of a sunset in rippling waters, and that her mouth was an\ninconsiderable trifle, a scrap of sanguine curves, and that her eyes\nwere purple glimpses of infinity.\n\n\"This same Patricia!\" he said, aloud.\n\n\n\n\nPART NINE - RELICS\n\n  \"You have chosen the love 'that lives sans murmurings,\n  Sans passion,' and incuriously endures\n  The gradual lapse of time. You have chosen as yours\n  A level life of little happenings;\n  And through the long autumnal evenings\n  Lord Love, no doubt, is of the company,\n  And hugs your ingleside contentedly,\n  Smiles at old griefs, and rustles needless wings.\n\n  \"And yet I think that sometimes memories\n  Of divers trysts, of blood that urged like wine\n  On moonlit nights, and of that first long kiss\n  Whereby your lips were first made one with mine,\n  Awake and trouble you, and loving is\n  Once more important and perhaps divine.\"\n\n  ALLEN ROSSITER. _Two in October._\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nTo those who knew John Charteris only through the medium of the printed\npage it must have appeared that the novelist was stayed in mid-career by\nan accident of unrelieved and singular brutality. And truly, thus\nextinguished by the unfounded jealousy of a madman, the force of\nCharteris's genius seemed, and seems to-day, as emphasized by that\nsinister caprice of chance which annihilated it.\n\nBut people in Lichfield, after the manner of each prophet's countrymen,\nhad their own point of view. The artist always stood between these\npeople and the artist's handiwork, in part obscuring it.\n\nIn any event, it was generally agreed in Lichfield that Anne Charteris's\nconduct after her husband's death was not all which could be desired. To\nbegin with, she attended the funeral, in black, it was true, but wearing\nonly the lightest of net veils pinned under her chin--\"more as if she\nwere going somewhere on the train, you know, than as if she were in\ngenuine bereavement.\"\n\n\"Jack didn't approve of mourning. He said it was a heathen survival.\"\nThat was the only explanation she offered.\n\nIt seemed inadequate to Lichfield. It was preferable, as good taste\nwent, for a widow to be too overcome to attend her husband's funeral at\nall. And Mrs. Charteris had not wept once during the church ceremony,\nand had not even had hysterics during the interment at Cedarwood; and\nshe had capped a scandalous morning's work by remaining with the\nundertaker and the bricklayers to supervise the closing of John\nCharteris's grave.\n\n\"Why, but of course. It is the last thing I will ever be allowed to do\nfor him,\" she had said, in innocent surprise. \"Why shouldn't I?\"\n\nHer air was such that you were both to talk to her about appearances.\n\n\"Because she isn't a bit like a widow,\" as Mrs. Ashmeade pointed out.\n\"Anybody can condole with a widow, and devote two outer sheets to\nexplaining that you realize nothing you can say will be of any comfort\nto her, and begin at the top of the inside page by telling her how much\nbetter off he is to-day--which I have always thought a double-edged\nassertion when advanced to a man's widow. But you cannot condole with a\nlantern whose light has been blown out. That is what Anne is.\"\n\nMrs. Ashmeade meditated and appeared dissatisfied. \"And John Charteris\nof all people!\"\n\nAnne was presently about the Memorial Edition of her husband's\ncollected writings. It was magnificently printed and when marketed\nachieved a flattering success. Robert Etheridge Townsend was\ncommissioned to write the authorized _Life of John Charteris_ and to\narrange the two volumes of _Letters_.\n\nAnne was considered an authority on literature and art in general,\nthrough virtue of reflected glory. And in the interviews she granted\nvarious journalists it was noticeable that she no longer referred to\n\"Jack\" or to \"Mr. Charteris,\" but to \"my husband.\" To have been his wife\nwas her one claim on estimation. And, for the rest, it is inadequate to\nlove the memory of a martyr. Worship is demanded; and so the wife became\nthe priestess.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nInto Colonel Musgrave's mental processes during this period it will not\ndo to pry too closely. The man had his white nights and his battles, in\npart with real grief and regret, and in part with sundry emotions which\nhe took on faith as the emotions he ought to have, and, therefore,\nmanifestly, suffered under.... \"Patricia was my wife, Jack was my\nbrother,\" ran his verdict in the outcome; and beyond that he did not\ncare to go.\n\nFor death cowed his thoughts. In the colonel's explicit theology dead\npeople were straightway conveyed to either one or the other of two\nplaces. He had very certainly never known anybody who in his opinion\nmerited the torments of his orthodox Gehenna; so that in imagination he\nvaguely populated its blazing corridors with Nero and Judas and Caesar\nBorgia and Henry VIII, and Spanish Inquisitors and the aboriginal\nAmerican Indians--excepting of course his ancestress Pocahontas--and\nwith Benedict Arnold and all the \"carpet-baggers\" and suchlike other\neminent practitioners of depravity. For no one whom Rudolph Musgrave\nhad ever encountered in the flesh had been really and profoundly wicked,\nRudolph Musgrave considered; and so, he always gravely estimated\nthis-or-that acquaintance, after death, to be \"better off, poor\nfellow\"--as the colonel phrased it, with a tinge of\nself-contradiction--even if he actually refrained in fancy from endowing\nthe deceased with aureate harps and crowns and footgear. In fine, death\ncowed the colonel's thoughts; beyond the grave they did not care to\nventure, and when confronted with that abyss they decorously balked.\n\nPatricia and Jack were as a matter of course \"better off,\" then--and,\nmiraculously purged of faults, with all their defects somehow remedied,\nthe colonel's wife and brother, with Agatha and the colonel's other\ninterred relatives, were partaking of dignified joys in bright supernal\niridescent realms, which the colonel resignedly looked forward to\nentering, on some comfortably remote day or another, and thus rejoining\nhis transfigured kindred.... Such was the colonel's charitable decision,\nin the forming whereof logic was in no way implicated. For religion, as\nthe colonel would have told you sedately, was not a thing to be reasoned\nabout. Attempting to do that, you became in Rudolph Musgrave's honest\neyes regrettably flippant.\n\nMeanwhile Cousin Lucy Fentnor was taking care of the colonel and little\nRoger. And Lichfield, long before the lettering on Patricia's tombstone\nhad time to lose its first light dusty gray, had accredited Cousin Lucy\nFentnor with illimitable willingness to become Mrs. Rudolph Musgrave,\nupon proper solicitation, although such tittle-tattle is neither here\nnor there; for at worst, a widowed, childless and impoverished\nsecond-cousin, discreetly advanced in her forties, was entitled to keep\nhouse for the colonel in his bereavement, as a jointly beneficial\narrangement, without provoking scandal's tongue to more than a jocose\ninnuendo or two when people met for \"auction\"--that new-fangled\nperplexing variant of bridge, just introduced, wherein you bid on the\nsuits.... And, besides, Cousin Lucy Fentnor (as befitted any one born an\nAllardyce) was to all accounts a notable housekeeper, famed alike for\nthe perilous glassiness of her hardwood floors, her dexterous management\nof servants, her Honiton-braid fancy-work (familiar to every patron of\nLichfield charity bazaars), and her unparalleled calves-foot jelly.\nUnder Cousin Lucy Fentnor's systematized coddling little Roger grew like\nthe proverbial ill weed, and the colonel likewise waxed perceptibly in\ngirth.\n\nThus it was that accident and a woman's intervention seemed once more to\ncombine in shielding Rudolph Musgrave from discomfort. And in\nconsequence it was considered improbable that at this late day the\ncolonel would do the proper thing by Clarice Pendomer, as, at the first\ntidings of Patricia's death, had been authentically rumored among the\nimaginative; and, in fact, Lichfield no longer considered that\nnecessary. The claim of outraged morality against these two had been\nthrown out of court, through some unworded social statute of\nlimitation, as far as Lichfield went. Of course it was interesting to\nnote that the colonel called at Mrs. Pendomer's rather frequently\nnowadays; but, then, Clarice Pendomer had all sorts of callers\nnow--though not many in skirts--and she played poker with men for money\nuntil unregenerate hours of the night, and was reputed with a wealth of\ncorroborative detail to have even less discussable sources of income: so\nthat, indeed, Clarice Pendomer was now rather precariously retained\nwithin the social pale through her initial precaution of having been\nborn a Bellingham.... But all such tittle-tattle, as has been said, is\nquite beside the mark, since with the decadence of Clarice Pendomer this\nchronicle has, in the outcome, as scant concern as with the marital\naspirations of Cousin Lucy Fentnor.\n\nAnd, moreover, the colonel--in colloquial phrase at least--went\neverywhere. After the six months of comparative seclusion which decency\nexacted of his widowerhood--and thereby afforded him ample leisure to\ncomplete and publish his _Lichfield Legislative Papers prior to\n1800_--the colonel, be it repeated, went everywhere; and people found\nhim no whit the worse company for his black gloves and the somber band\nstitched to his coatsleeve. So Lichfield again received him gladly, as\nthe social triumph of his generation. Handsome and trim and affable, no\nimaginable tourist could possibly have divined--for everybody in\nLichfield knew, of course--that Rudolph Musgrave had rounded his\nhalf-century; and he stayed, as ever, invaluable to Lichfield matrons\nalike against the entertainment of an \"out-of-town\" girl, the management\nof a cotillon, and the prevention of unpleasant pauses among incongruous\ndinner-companies.\n\nBut of Anne Charteris he saw very little nowadays. And, indeed, it was\nof her own choice that Anne lived apart from Lichfieldian junketings,\ncontented with her dreams and her pride therein, and her remorseful\ntender memories of the things she might have done for Jack and had not\ndone--lived upon exalted levels nowadays, to which the colonel's more\nurbane bereavement did not aspire.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\n\"Charteris\" was engraved in large, raised letters upon the granite\ncoping over which Anne stepped to enter the trim burial-plot wherein her\ndead lay.\n\nThe place to-day is one of the \"points of interest\" in Cedarwood.\nTourists, passing through Lichfield, visit it as inevitably as they do\nthe graves of the Presidents, the Southern generals and the many other\nfamous people which the old cemetery contains; and the negro hackmen of\nLichfield are already profuse in inaccurate information concerning its\noccupant. In a phrase, the post card which pictures \"E 9436--Grave of\nJohn Charteris\" is among the seven similar misinterpretations of\nlocalities most frequently demanded in Lichfieldian drugstores and\nnews-stands.\n\nHer victoria had paused a trifle farther up the hill, where two big\nsycamores overhung the roadway. She came into the place alone, walking\nquickly, for she was unwarrantably flustered by her late encounter. And\nwhen she found, of all people, Rudolph Musgrave standing by her\nhusband's grave, as in a sort of puzzled and yet reverent meditation,\nshe was, and somehow as half-guiltily, assuring herself there was no\npossible reason for the repugnance--nay, the rage,--which a mere\nglimpse of trudging, painted and flamboyant Clarice Pendomer had\nkindled. Yet it must be recorded that Anne had always detested Clarice.\n\nNow Anne spoke, as the phrase runs, before she thought. \"She came with\nyou!\"\n\nAnd he answered, as from the depths of an uncalled-for comprehension\nwhich was distinctly irritating:\n\n\"Yes. And Harry, too, for that matter. Only our talk got somehow to be\nnot quite the sort it would be salutary for him to take an interest in.\nSo we told Harry to walk on slowly to the gate, and be sure not to do\nany number of things he would never have thought of if we hadn't\nsuggested them. You know how people are with children----\"\n\n\"Harry is--her boy?\" Anne, being vexed, had almost added--\"and yours?\"\n\n\"Oh----! Say the _fons et origo_ of the Pendomer divorce case, poor\nlittle chap. Yes, Harry is her boy.\"\n\nAnne said, and again, as she perceived within the moment, a thought too\nexpeditiously: \"I wish you wouldn't bring them here, Colonel Musgrave.\"\n\nIndeed, it seemed to her flat desecration that Musgrave should have\nbrought his former mistress into this hallowed plot of ground. She did\nnot mind--illogically, perhaps--his bringing the child.\n\n\"Eh----? Oh, yes,\" said Colonel Musgrave. He was sensibly nettled. \"You\nwish 'Colonel Musgrave' wouldn't bring them here. But then, you see, we\nhad been to Patricia's grave. And we remembered how Jack stood by us\nboth when--when things bade fair to be even more unpleasant for Clarice\nand myself than they actually were. You shouldn't, I think, grudge even\nsuch moral reprobates the privilege of being properly appreciative of\nwhat he did for both of us. Besides, you always come on Saturdays, you\nknow. We couldn't very well anticipate that you would be here this\nafternoon.\"\n\nSo he had been at pains to spy upon her! Anne phrased it thus in her\nsoul, being irritated, and crisply answered:\n\n\"I am leaving Lichfield to-morrow. I had meant this to be my farewell to\nthem until October.\"\n\nColonel Musgrave had glanced toward the little headstone, with its\nrather lengthy epitaph, which marked the resting-place of this woman's\nonly child; and then to the tall shaft whereon was engraved just \"John\nCharteris.\" The latter inscription was very characteristic of her\nview-point, he reflected; and yet reasonable, too; as one might mention\na Hector or a Goethe, say, without being at pains to disclaim allusion\nto the minor sharers of either name.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Well, I shall not intrude.\"\n\n\"No--wait,\" she dissented.\n\nHer voice was altered now, for there had come into it a marvelous\ngentleness.\n\nAnd Colonel Musgrave remained motionless. The whole world was\nmotionless, ineffably expectant, as it seemed to him.\n\nSunset was at hand. On one side was the high wooden fence which showed\nthe boundary of Cedarwood, and through its palings and above it, was\nvisible the broad, shallow river, comfortably colored, for the most\npart, like _caf\u00e9 au lait_, but flecked with many patches of foam and\nflat iron-colored rocks and innumerable islets, some no bigger than a\nbilliard-table, but with even the tiniest boasting a tree or two. On the\nother--westward--was a mounting vista of close-shaven turf, and many\ncopings, like magnified geometrical problems, and a host of stunted\ngrowing things--with the staid verdancy of evergreens predominant--and a\nmultitude of candid shafts and slabs and crosses and dwarfed lambs and\nmeditant angels.\n\nSome of these thronged memorials were tinged with violet, and others\nwere a-glitter like silver, just as the ordered trees shaded them or no\nfrom the low sun. The disposition of all worldly affairs, the man dimly\nknew, was very anciently prearranged by an illimitable and, upon the\nwhole, a kindly wisdom.\n\nShe was considering the change in him. Anne was recollecting that\nColonel Musgrave had somewhat pointedly avoided her since her widowhood.\nHe seemed almost a stranger nowadays.\n\nAnd she could not recognize in the man any resemblance to the boy whom\nshe remembered--so long ago--excepting just his womanish mouth, which\nwas as in the old time very full and red and sensitive. And,\nillogically enough, both this great change in him and this one feature\nthat had never changed annoyed her equally.\n\nShe was also worried by his odd tone of flippancy. It jarred, it\nvaguely--for the phrase has no equivalent--\"rubbed her the wrong way.\"\nHere at a martyr's tomb it was hideously out-of-place, and yet she did\nnot see her way clear to rebuke. So she remained silent.\n\nBut Rudolph Musgrave was uncanny in some respects. For he said within\nthe moment, \"I am not a bit like John Charteris, am I?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, quietly. It had been her actual thought.\n\nAnne stayed a tiny while quite motionless. Her eyes saw nothing\nphysical. It was the attitude, Colonel Musgrave reflected, of one who\nlistens to a far-off music and, incommunicably, you knew that the music\nwas of a martial sort. She was all in black, of course, very slim and\npure and beautiful. The great cluster of red roses, loosely held, was\nlike blood against the somber gown.\n\nThe widow of John Charteris, in fine, was a very different person from\nthat Anne Willoughby whom Rudolph Musgrave had loved so long and long\nago. This woman had tasted of tonic sorrows unknown to Rudolph Musgrave,\nand had got consolation too, somehow, in far half-credible uplands\nunvisited by him. But, he knew, she lived, and was so exquisite, mainly\nby virtue of that delusion which he, of all men, had preserved; Anne\nCharteris was of his creation, his masterpiece; and viewing her, he was\naware of great reverence and joy.\n\nAnne was happy. It was for that he had played.\n\nBut aloud, \"I am envious,\" Rudolph Musgrave declared. \"He is the single\nsolitary man I ever knew whose widow was contented to be simply his\nrelict for ever and ever, amen. For you will always be just the woman\nJohn Charteris loved, won't you? Yes, if you lived to be thirty-seven\nyears older than Methuselah, and every genius and potentate in the world\nshould come a-wooing in the meantime, it never would occur to you that\nyou could possibly be anything, even to an insane person, except his\nrelict. And he has been dead now all of three whole years! So I am\nenvious, just as we ordinary mortals can't help being of you both;\nand--may I say it?--I am glad.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThey were standing thus when a boy of ten or eleven came unhurriedly\ninto the \"section.\" He assumed possession of Colonel Musgrave's hand as\nthough the action were a matter of course.\n\n\"I got lost, Colonel Musgrave,\" the child composedly announced. \"I\nwalked ever so far, and the gate wasn't where we left it. And the roads\nkept turning and twisting so, it seemed I'd never get anywhere. I don't\nlike being lost when it's getting dark and there's so many dead people\n'round, do you?\"\n\nThe colonel was moved to disapproval. \"Young man, I suppose your poor\ndeserted mother is looking for you everywhere, and has probably torn out\nevery solitary strand of hair she possesses by this time.\"\n\n\"I reckon she is,\" the boy assented. The topic did not appear to be in\nhis eyes of pre\u00ebminent importance.\n\nThen Anne Charteris said, \"Harry,\" and her voice was such that Rudolph\nMusgrave wheeled with amazement in his face.\n\nThe boy had gone to her complaisantly, and she stood now with one hand\non either of his shoulders, regarding him. Her lips were parted, but\nthey did not move at all.\n\n\"You are Mrs. Pendomer's boy, aren't you?\" said Anne Charteris, in a\nwhile. She had some difficulty in articulation.\n\n\"Yes'm,\" Harry assented, \"and we come here 'most every Wednesday, and,\nplease, ma'am, you're hurtin' me.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to--dear,\" the woman added, painfully. \"Don't interfere\nwith me, Rudolph Musgrave! Your mother must be very fond of you, Harry.\nI had a little boy once. I was fond of him. He would have been eleven\nyears old last February.\"\n\n\"Please, ma'am, I wasn't eleven till April, and I ain't tall for my age,\nbut Tubby Parsons says----\"\n\nThe woman gave an odd, unhuman sound. \"Not until April!\"\n\n\"Harry,\" said Colonel Musgrave then, \"an enormous whale is coming down\nthe river in precisely two minutes. Perhaps if you were to look through\nthe palings of that fence you might see him. I don't suppose you would\ncare to, though?\"\n\nAnd Harry strolled resignedly toward the fence. Harry Pendomer did not\nlike this funny lady who had hurt, frightened eyes. He did not believe\nin the whale, of course, any more than he did in Santa Claus. But like\nmost children, he patiently accepted the fact that grown people are\nunaccountable overlords appointed by some vast _b\u00eatise_, whom, if only\nthrough prudential motives, it is preferable to humor.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nColonel Musgrave stood now upon the other side of John Charteris's\ngrave--just in the spot that was reserved for her own occupancy some\nday.\n\n\"You are ill, Anne. You are not fit to be out. Go home.\"\n\n\"I had a little boy once,\" she said. \"'But that's all past and gone, and\ngood times and bad times and all times pass over.' There's an odd simple\nmusic in the sentence, isn't there? Yet I remember it chiefly because I\nused to read that book to him and he loved it. And it was my child that\ndied. Why is this other child so like him?\"\n\n\"Oh, then, that's it, is it?\" said Rudolph Musgrave, as in relief.\n\"Bless me, I suppose all these little shavers are pretty much alike. I\ncan only tell Roger from the other boys by his red head. Humanity in the\nraw, you know. Still, it is no wonder it gave you a turn. You had much\nbetter go home, however, and not take any foolish risks, and put your\nfeet in hot water, and rub cologne on your temples, and do all the other\nsuitable things----\"\n\n\"I remember now,\" she continued, without any apparent emotion, and as\nthough he had not spoken. \"When I came into the room you were saying\nthat the child must be considered. You were both very angry, and I was\nalarmed--foolishly alarmed, perhaps. And my--and John Charteris said,\n'Let him tell, then'--and you told me--\"\n\n\"The truth, Anne.\"\n\n\"And he sat quietly by. Oh, if he'd had the grace, the common\nmanliness--!\" She shivered here. \"But he never interrupted you. I--I was\nnot looking at him. I was thinking how vile you were. And when you had\nended, he said, 'My dear, I am sorry you should have been involved in\nthis. But since you are, I think we can assure Rudolph that both of us\nwill regard his confidence as sacred.' Then I remembered him, and\nthought how noble he was! And all those years that were so happy, hour\nby hour, he was letting you--meet his bills!\" She seemed to wrench out\nthe inadequate metaphor.\n\nYou could hear the far-off river, now, faint as the sound of boiling\nwater.\n\nAfter a few pacings Colonel Musgrave turned upon her. He spoke with a\ncurious simplicity.\n\n\"There isn't any use in lying to you. You wouldn't believe. You would\nonly go to some one else--some woman probably,--who would jump at the\nchance of telling you everything and a deal more. Yes, there are a great\nmany 'they _do_ say's' floating about. This was the only one that came\nnear being--serious. The man was very clever.--Oh, he wasn't vulgarly\nlecherous. He was simply--Jack Charteris. He always irritated Lichfield,\nthough, by not taking Lichfield very seriously. You would hear every\nby-end of retaliative and sniggered-over mythology, and in your present\nstate of mind you would believe all of them. I happen to know that a\ngreat many of these stories are not true.\"\n\n\"A great many of these stories,\" Anne repeated, \"aren't true! A great\nmany aren't! That ought to be consoling, oughtn't it?\" She spoke without\na trace of bitterness.\n\n\"I express myself very badly. What I really mean, what I am aiming at,\nis that I wish you would let me answer any questions you might like to\nask, because I will answer them truthfully. Very few people would. You\nsee, you go about the world so like a gray-stone saint who has just\nstepped down from her niche for the fraction of a second,\" he added, as\nwith venom, \"that it is only human nature to dislike you.\"\n\nAnne was not angry. It had come to her, quite as though she were\nconsidering some other woman, that what the man said was, in a fashion,\ntrue.\n\n\"There is sunlight and fresh air in the street,\" John Charteris had been\nwont to declare, \"and there is a culvert at the corner. I think it is a\nmistake for us to emphasize the culvert.\"\n\nSo he had trained her to disbelieve in its existence. She saw this now.\nIt did not matter. It seemed to her that nothing mattered any more.\n\n\"I've only one question, I think. Why did you do it?\" She spoke with\nbright amazement in her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, my dear!\" he seriocomically deplored. \"Why, because it was\nsuch a noble thing to do. It was so like the estimable young man in a\nplay, you know, who acknowledges the crime he never committed and takes\na curtain-call immediately afterwards. In fine, I simply observed to\nmyself, with the late Monsieur de Bergerac, 'But what a gesture!'\" And\nhe parodied an actor's motion in this r\u00f4le.\n\nShe stayed unsmiling and patiently awaiting veracity. Anne did not\nunderstand that Colonel Musgrave was telling the absolute truth. And so,\n\n\"You haven't _any_ sense of humor,\" he lamented. \"You used to have a\ndeal, too, before you took to being conscientiously cheerful, and\ndiffusing sweetness and light among your cowering associates. Well, it\nwas because it helped him a little. Oh, I am being truthful now. I had\nsome reason to dislike Jack Charteris, but odd as it is, I know to-day I\nnever did. I ought to have, perhaps. But I didn't.\"\n\n\"My friend, you are being almost truthful. But I want the truth entire.\"\n\n\"It isn't polite to disbelieve people,\" he reproved her; \"or at the very\nleast, according to the best books on etiquette, you ought not to do it\naudibly. Would you mind if I smoked? I could be more veracious then.\nThere is something in tobacco that makes frankness a matter of course. I\nthank you.\"\n\nHe produced an amber holder, fitted a cigarette into it, and presently\ninhaled twice. He said, with a curt voice:\n\n\"The reason, naturally, was you. You may remember certain things that\nhappened just before John Charteris came and took you. Oh, that is\nprecisely what he did! You are rather a narrow-minded woman now, in\nconsequence--or in my humble opinion, at least--and deplorably superior.\nIt pleased the man to have in his house--if you will overlook my\nventuring into metaphor,--one cool room very sparsely furnished where he\ncould come when the mood seized him. He took the raw material from me,\nwherewith to build that room, because he wanted that room. I acquiesced,\nbecause I had not the skill wherewith to fight him.\"\n\nAnne understood him now, as with a great drench of surprise. And fear\nwas what she felt in chief when she saw for just this moment as though\nit had lightened, the man's face transfigured, and tender, and strange\nto her.\n\n\"I tried to buy your happiness, to--yes, just to keep you blind\nindefinitely. Had the price been heavier, I would have paid it the more\ngladly. Fate has played a sorry trick. _You_ would never have seen\nthrough him. My dear, I have wanted very often to shake you,\" he said.\n\nAnd she knew, in a glorious terror, that she desired him to shake her,\nand as she had never desired anything else in life.\n\n\"Oh, well, I am just a common, ordinary, garden-sort of fool. The\nMusgraves always are, in one fashion or another,\" he sulkily concluded.\nAnd now the demigod was merely Rudolph Musgrave again, and she was not\nafraid any longer, but only inexpressibly fordone.\n\n\"Isn't that like a woman?\" he presently demanded of the June heavens.\n\"To drag something out of a man with inflexibility, monomania and moral\ngrappling-irons, and _then_ not like it! Oh, very well! I am disgusted\nby your sex's axiomatic variability. I shall take Harry to his fond\nmamma at once.\"\n\nShe did not say anything. A certain new discovery obsessed her like a\npiece of piercing music.\n\nThen Rudolph Musgrave gave the tiniest of gestures downward. \"And I have\ntold you this, in chief, because we two remember him. He wanted you. He\ntook you. You are his. You will always be. He gave you just a fragment\nof himself. That fragment was worth more than everything I had to\noffer.\"\n\nAnne very carefully arranged her roses on the ivy-covered grave. \"I do\nnot know--meanwhile, I give these to our master. And my real widowhood\nbegins to-day.\"\n\nAnd as she rose he looked at her across the colorful mound, and smiled,\nhalf as with embarrassment. A lie, he thought, might ameliorate the\nsituation, and he bravely hazarded a prodigious one. \"Is it necessary to\ntell you that Jack loved you? And that the others never really counted?\"\n\nHe rejoiced to see that Anne believed him. \"No,\" she assented, \"no, not\nwith him. Oddly enough, I am proud of that, even now. But--don't you\nsee?--I never loved him. I was just his priestess--the priestess of a\nstucco god! Otherwise, I would know it wasn't his fault, but altogether\nthat of--the others.\"\n\nHe grimaced and gave a bantering flirt of his head. He said, with\nquizzing eyes:\n\n\"Would it do any good to quote Lombroso, and Maudsley, and Gall, and\nKrafft-Ebing, and Flechsig, and so on? and to tell you that the\nexcessive use of one brain faculty must necessarily cause a lack of\nnutriment to all the other brain-cells? It would be rather up-to-date.\nThere is a deal I could tell you also as to what poisonous blood he\ninherited; but to do this I have not the right.\" And then Rudolph\nMusgrave said in all sincerity: \"'A wild, impetuous whirlwind of passion\nand faculty slumbered quiet there; such heavenly _melody_ dwelling in\nthe heart of it.'\"\n\nShe had put aside alike the drolling and the palliative suggestion, like\nflimsy veils. \"I think it wouldn't do any good whatever. When growing\nthings are broken by the whirlwind, they don't, as a rule, discuss the\ntheory of air-currents as a consolation. Men such as he was take what\nthey desire. It isn't fair--to us others. But it's true, for all that--\"\n\nTheir eyes met warily; and for no reason which they shared in common\nthey smiled together.\n\n\"Poor little Lady of Shalott,\" said Rudolph Musgrave, \"the mirror is\ncracked from side to side, isn't it? I am sorry. For life is not so\neasily disposed of. And there is only life to look at now, and life is a\nbewilderingly complex business, you will find, because the laws of it\nare so childishly simple--and implacable. And one of these laws seems to\nbe that in our little planet, might makes right--\"\n\nHe stayed to puff his cigarette.\n\n\"Oh, Rudolph dear, don't--don't be just a merry-Andrew!\" she cried\nimpulsively, before he had time to continue, which she perceived he\nmeant to do, as if it did not matter.\n\nAnd he took her full meaning, quite as he had been used in the old times\nto discourse upon a half-sentence. \"I am afraid I am that, rather,\" he\nsaid, reflectively. \"But then Clarice and I could hardly have weathered\nscandal except by making ourselves particularly agreeable to everybody.\nAnd somehow I got into the habit of making people laugh. It isn't very\ndifficult. I am rather an adept at telling stories which just graze\nimpropriety, for instance. You know, they call me the social triumph of\nmy generation. And people are glad to see me because I am 'so awfully\nfunny' and 'simply killing' and so on. And I suppose it tells in the\nlong run--like the dyer's hand, you know.\"\n\n\"It does tell.\" Anne was thinking it would always tell. And that, too,\nwould be John Charteris's handiwork.\n\nEnsued a silence. Rudolph Musgrave was painstakingly intent upon his\ncigarette. A nestward-plunging bird called to his mate impatiently.\nThen Anne shook her head impatiently.\n\n\"Come, while I'm thinking, I will drive you back to Lichfield.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; that wouldn't do at all,\" he said, with absolute decision. \"No,\nyou see I have to return the boy. And I can't quite imagine your\ncarriage waiting at the doors of 'that Mrs. Pendomer.'\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Anne fleetingly thought, \"_he_ would have understood.\" But aloud\nshe only said: \"And do you think I hate her any longer? Yes, it is true\nI hated her until to-day, and now I'm just sincerely sorry for her. For\nshe and I--and you and even the child yonder--and all that any of us is\nto-day--are just so many relics of John Charteris. Yet he has done with\nus--at last!\"\n\nShe said this with an inhalation of the breath; but she did not look at\nhim.\n\n\"Take care!\" he said, with an unreasonable harshness. \"For I forewarn\nyou I am imagining vain things.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid, somehow.\" But Anne did not look at him.\n\nHe saw as with a rending shock how like the widow of John Charteris was\nto Anne Willoughby; and unforgotten pulses, very strange and irrational\nand dear, perplexed him sorely. He debated, and flung aside the\ncigarette as an out-moded detail of his hobbling part.\n\n\"You say I did a noble thing for you. I tried to. But quixotism has its\nprice. To-day I am not quite the man who did that thing. John Charteris\nhas set his imprint too deep upon us. We served his pleasure. We are not\nany longer the boy and girl who loved each other.\"\n\nShe waited in the rising twilight with a yet averted face. The world was\nmotionless, ineffably expectant, as it seemed to him. And the\ndisposition of all worldly affairs, the man dimly knew, was very\nanciently prearranged by an illimitable and, upon the whole, a kindly\nwisdom.\n\nSo that, \"My dear, my dear!\" he swiftly said: \"I don't think I can word\njust what my feeling is for you. Always my view of the world has been\nthat you existed, and that some other people existed--as accessories--\"\n\nThen he was silent for a heart-beat, appraising her. His hands lifted\ntoward her and fell within the moment, as if it were in impotence.\n\nAnne spoke at last, and the sweet voice of her was very glad and proud\nand confident.\n\n\"My friend, remember that I have not thanked you. You have done the most\nfoolish and--the manliest thing I ever knew a man to do, just for my\nsake. And I have accepted it as if it were a matter of course. And I\nshall always do so. Because it was your right to do this very brave and\nfoolish thing for me. I know you joyed in doing it. Rudolph ... you\ncannot understand how glad I am you joyed in doing it.\"\n\nTheir eyes met. It is not possible to tell you all they were aware of\nthrough that moment, because it is a knowledge so rarely apprehended,\nand even then for such a little while, that no man who has sensed it can\nremember afterward aught save the splendor and perfection of it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd yet Anne looked back once. There was just the tall, stark shaft, and\non it \"John Charteris.\" The thing was ominous and vast, all colored like\nwet gravel, save where the sunlight tipped it with clean silver very\nhigh above their reach.\n\n\"Come,\" she quickly said to Rudolph Musgrave; \"come, for I am afraid.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nAnd are we then to leave them with glad faces turned to that new day\nwherein, above the ashes of old errors and follies and mischances and\nmiseries, they were to raise the structure of such a happiness as earth\nrarely witnesses? Would it not be, instead, a grateful task more fully\nto depicture how Rudolph Musgrave's love of Anne won finally to its\nreward, and these two shared the evening of their lives in tranquil\nservice of unswerving love come to its own at last?\n\nUndoubtedly, since the espousal of one's first love--by oneself--is a\nphenomenon rarely encountered outside of popular fiction, it would be a\nvery gratifying task to record that Anne and Rudolph Musgrave were\nmarried that autumn; that subsequently Lichfield was astounded by the\nfervor of their life-long bliss; that Colonel and (the second) Mrs.\nMusgrave were universally respected, in a word, and their dinner-parties\nwere always prominently chronicled by the _Lichfield Courier-Herald_;\nand that Anne took excellent care of little Roger, and that she and her\nsecond husband proved eminently suited to each other.\n\nBut, as a matter of fact, not one of these things ever happened....\n\n\"I have been thinking it over,\" Anne deplored. \"Oh, Rudolph dear, I\nperfectly realize you are the best and noblest man I ever knew. And I\nhave always loved you very much, my dear; that is why I could never\nabide poor Mrs. Pendomer. And yet--it is a feeling I simply can't\nexplain----\"\n\n\"That you belong to Jack in spite of everything?\" the colonel said.\n\"Why, but of course! I might have known that Jack would never have\nallowed any simple incidental happening such as his death to cause his\nmissing a possible trick.\"\n\nAnne would have comforted Rudolph Musgrave; but, to her discomfiture,\nthe colonel was grinning, however ruefully.\n\n\"I was thinking,\" he stated, \"of the only time that I ever, to my\nknowledge, talked face to face with the devil. It is rather odd how\nobstinately life clings to the most hackneyed trick of ballad-makers;\nand still naively pretends to enrich her productions by the stale device\nof introducing a refrain--so that the idlest remarks of as much as three\nyears ago keep cropping up as the actual gist of the present!...\nHowever, were it within my power, I would evoke Amaimon straightway now\nto come up yonder, through your hearthrug, and to answer me quite\nhonestly if I did not tell him on the beach at Matocton that this,\nprecisely this, would be the outcome of your knowing everything!\"\n\n\"I told you that I couldn't, quite, _explain_----\" Anne said.\n\n\"Eh, but I can, my dear,\" he informed her. \"The explanation is that\nLichfield bore us, shaped us, and made us what we are. We may not enjoy\na monopoly of the virtues here in Lichfield, but there is one trait at\nleast which the children of Lichfield share in common. We are loyal. We\ngive but once; and when we give, we give all that we have; and when we\nhave once given it, neither common-sense, nor a concourse of\nexpostulating seraphim, nor anything else in the universe, can induce us\nto believe that a retraction, or even a qualification, of the gift would\nbe quite worthy of us.\"\n\n\"But that--that's foolish. Why, it's unreasonable,\" Anne pointed out.\n\n\"Of course it is. And that is why I am proud of Lichfield. And that is\nwhy you are to-day Jack's wife and always will be just Jack's wife--and\nwhy to-day I am Patricia's husband--and why Lichfield to-day is\nLichfield. There is something braver in life than to be just reasonable,\nthank God! And so, we keep the faith, my dear, however obsolete we find\nfidelity to be. We keep to the old faith--we of Lichfield, who have\ngiven hostages to the past. We remember even now that we gave freely in\nan old time, and did not haggle.... And so, we are proud--yes! we are\nconsumedly proud, and we know that we have earned the right to be\nproud.\"\n\nA little later Colonel Musgrave said:\n\n\"And yet--it takes a monstrous while to dispose of our universe's\nsubtleties. I have loved you my whole life long, as accurately as we\ncan phrase these matters. There is no--no _reasonable_ reason why you\nshould not marry me now; and you would marry me if I pressed it. And I\ndo not press it. Perhaps it all comes of our both having been reared in\nLichfield. Perhaps that is why I, too, have been 'thinking it over.' You\nsee,\" he added, with a smile, \"the rivet in grandfather's neck is not\nlightly to be ignored, after all. No, you do not know what I am talking\nabout, my dear. And--well, anyhow, I belong to Patricia. Upon the whole,\nI am glad that I belong to Patricia; for Patricia and what Patricia\nmeant to me was the one vital thing in a certain person's rather\nhand-to-mouth existence--oh, yes, in spite of everything! I know it now.\nAnne Charteris,\" the colonel cried, \"I wouldn't marry you or any other\nwoman breathing, even though you were to kneel and implore me upon the\nknees of a centipede. For I belong to Patricia; and the rivet stays\nunbroken, after all.\"\n\n\"Oh, and am I being very foolish again?\" Anne asked. \"For I have been\nremembering that when--when Jack was not quite truthful about some\nthings, you know,--the truth he hid was always one which would have hurt\nme. And I like to believe that was, at least in part, the reason he hid\nit, Rudolph. So he purchased my happiness--well, at ugly prices perhaps.\nBut he purchased it, none the less; and I had it through all those\nyears. So why shouldn't I--after all--be very grateful to him? And,\nbesides\"--her voice broke--\"besides, he was Jack, you know. He belonged\nto me. What does it matter what he did? He belonged to me, and I loved\nhim.\"\n\nAnd to the colonel's discomfort Anne began to cry.\n\n\"There, there!\" he said, \"so the real truth is out at last. And tears\ndon't help very much. It does seem a bit unfair, my dear, I know. But\nthat is simply because you and I are living in a universe which has\nnever actually committed itself, under any penalizing bond, to be\nentirely candid as to the laws by which it is conducted.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it may be that Rudolph Musgrave voiced quite obsolete views. For he\nsaid this at a very remote period--when the Beef Trust was being\n\"investigated\" in Washington; when an excited Iberian constabulary was\nstill hunting the anarchists who had attempted to assassinate the young\nKing and Queen of Spain upon their wedding-day; when the rebuilding of\nan earthquake-shattered San Francisco was just beginning to be talked of\nas a possibility; and when editorials were mostly devoted to discussion\nof what Mr. Bryan would have to say about bi-metallism when he returned\nfrom his foreign tour.\n\nAnd, besides, it was Rudolph Musgrave's besetting infirmity always to\nshrink--under shelter of whatever grandiloquent excuse--from making\nchanges. One may permissibly estimate this foible to have weighed with\nhim a little, even now, just as in all things it had always weighed in\nLichfield with all his generation. An old custom is not lightly broken.\n\n\n\n\nPART TEN - IMPRIMIS\n\n  \"So let us laugh, lest vain rememberings\n  Breed, as of old, some rude bucolic cry\n  Of awkward anguishes, of dreams that die\n  Without decorum, of Love lacking wings\n  Yet striving you-ward in his flounderings\n  Eternally,--as now, even when I lie\n  As I lie now, who know that you and I\n  Exist and heed not lesser happenings.\n\n  \"I was. I am. I will be. Eh, no doubt\n  For some sufficient cause, I drift, defer,\n  Equivocate, dream, hazard, grow more stout,\n  Age, am no longer Love's idolater,--\n  And yet I could and would not live without\n  Your faith that heartens and your doubts which spur.\"\n\n\nLIONEL CROCHARD. _Palinodia_.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nSo weeks and months, and presently irrevocable years, passed tranquilly;\nand nothing very important seemed to happen nowadays, either for good or\nill; and Rudolph Musgrave was content enough.\n\nTrue, there befell, and with increasing frequency, periods when one must\nlie abed, and be coaxed into taking interminable medicines, and be\nministered unto generally, because one was of a certain age nowadays,\nand must be prudent. But even such necessities, these underhanded\nindignities of time, had their alleviations. Trained nurses, for\nexample, were uncommonly well-informed and agreeable young women, when\nyou came to know them--and quite lady-like, too, for all that in our\ntopsy-turvy days these girls had to work for their living. Unthinkable\nas it seemed, the colonel found that his night-nurse, a Miss Ramsay, was\nactually by birth a Ramsay of Blenheim; and for a little the discovery\ndepressed him. But to be made much of, upon whatever terms, was always\ntreatment to which the colonel submitted only too docilely. And,\nbesides, in this queer, comfortable, just half-waking state, the\ncolonel found one had the drollest dreams, evolving fancies such as were\nreally a credit to one's imagination....\n\nFor instance, one very often imagined that Patricia was more close at\nhand nowadays.... No, she was not here in the room, of course, but\noutside, in the street, at the corner below, where the letterbox stood.\nYes, she was undoubtedly there, the colonel reflected drowsily. And they\nhad been so certain her return could only result in unhappiness, and\nthey were so wise, that whilst she waited for her opportunity Patricia\nherself began to be a little uneasy. She had patrolled the block six\ntimes before the chance came.\n\nAnd it seemed to Rudolph Musgrave, drowsily pleased by his own\ninventiveness, that Patricia was glad this afternoon was so hot that no\none was abroad except the small boy at the corner house, who sat upon\nthe bottom porch-step, and, as children so often do, appeared intently\nto appraise the world at large with an inexplicable air of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Now think how Rudolph would feel,\"--the colonel whimsically played at\nreading Patricia's reflection--\"if I were to be arrested as a suspicious\ncharacter--that's what the newspapers always call them, I think--on his\nvery doorstep! And he must have been home a half-hour ago at least,\nbecause I know it's after five. But the side-gate's latched, and I can't\nring the door-bell--if only because it would be too ridiculous to have\nto ask the maid to tell Colonel Musgrave his wife wanted to see him.\nBesides, I don't know the new house-girl. I wish now we hadn't let old\nMary go, even though she was so undependable about thorough-cleaning.\"\n\nAnd it seemed to Rudolph Musgrave that Patricia was tired of pacing\nbefore the row of houses, each so like the other, and compared herself\nto Gulliver astray upon a Brobdingnagian bookshelf which held a \"library\nset\" of some huge author. She had lost interest, too, in the new house\nupon the other side.\n\n\"If things were different I would have to call on them. But as it is, I\nam spared that bother at least,\" said Patricia, just as if being dead\ndid not change people at all.\n\nThen a colored woman, trim and frillily-capped, came out of the watched\nhouse. She bore some eight or nine letters in one hand, and fanned\nherself with them in a leisurely flat-footed progress to the mailbox at\nthe lower corner.\n\n\"She looks capable,\" was Patricia's grudging commentary, in slipping\nthrough the doorway into the twilight of the hall. \"But it isn't safe to\nleave the front-door open like this. One never knows--No, I can tell by\nthe look of her she's the sort that can't be induced to sleep on the\nlot, and takes mysterious bundles home at night.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nAnd it seemed to Rudolph Musgrave, now in the full flow of this droll\ndream, that Patricia resentfully noted her front-hall had been \"meddled\nwith.\" This much alone might Patricia observe in a swift transit to the\nparlor.\n\nShe waited there until the maid returned; and registered to the woman's\ncredit the discreet soft closing of the front-door and afterward the\nwell-nigh inaudible swish of the rear door of the dining-room as the\nmaid went back into the kitchen.\n\n\"In any event,\" Patricia largely conceded, \"she probably doesn't clash\nthe knives and forks in the pantry after supper, like she was hostile\narmaments with any number of cutlasses apiece. I remember Rudolph simply\ncouldn't stand it when we had Ethel.\"\n\nSo much was satisfactory. Only--her parlor was so altered!\n\nThere was--to give you just her instantaneous first impression--so\nlittle in it. Broad spaces of plain color showed everywhere; and\nPatricia's ideal of what a parlor should be, as befitted the ch\u00e2telaine\nof a fine home in Lichfield, had always been the tangled elegancies of\nthe front show-window of a Woman's Exchange for Fancy Work. The room had\neven been repapered--odiously, as she considered; and the shiny floor of\nit boasted just three inefficient rugs, like dingy rafts upon a sea of\nvery strong coffee.\n\nPatricia looked in vain for her grandiose plush-covered chairs, her\nimmaculate \"tidies,\" and the proud yellow lambrequin, embroidered in\nhigh relief with white gardenias, which had formerly adorned the\nmantelpiece. The heart of her hungered for her unforgotten and\nunforgettable \"watered-silk\" papering wherein white roses bloomed\nexuberantly against a yellow background--which deplorably faded if you\ndid not keep the window-shades down, she remembered--and she wanted back\nher white thick comfortable carpet which hid the floor completely, so\nthat everywhere you trod upon the buxomest of stalwart yellow roses,\neach bunch of which was lavishly tied with wind-blown ribbons.\n\nThen, too, her cherished spinning-wheel, at least two hundred and fifty\nyears old, which had looked so pretty after she had gilded it and added\na knot of pink sarsenet, was departed; and gone as well was the\nmirror-topped table, with its array of china swan and frogs and\nwater-lilies artistically grouped about its speckless surface. Even her\nprized engraving of \"Michael Angelo Buonarotti\"--contentedly regarding\nhis just finished Moses, while a pope tiptoed into the room through a\nside-door--had been removed, with all its splendors of red-plush and\nintricate gilt-framing.\n\nJust here and there, in fine, like a familiar face in a crowd, she could\ndiscover some one of her more sedately-colored \"parlor ornaments\"; and\nthe whole history of it--its donor or else its price, the gestures of\nthe shopman, even what sort of weather it was when she and Rudolph found\n\"exactly what I've been looking for\" in the shop-window, and the\nStapyltonian, haggling over the price with which Patricia had\nbargained--such unimportant details as these now vividly awakened in\nrecollection.... In fine, this room was not her parlor at all, and in it\nPatricia was lonely.... Yes, yes, she would be nowadays, the colonel\nreflected, for he himself had never been in thorough sympathy with all\nthe changes made by Roger's self-assured young wife.\n\nThus it was with the first floor of the house, through which Patricia\nstrayed with uniform discomfort. This place was home no longer.\n\nThus it was with the first floor of the house. Everywhere the equipments\nwere strange, or at best arranged not quite as Patricia would have\nplaced them. Yet they had not any look of being recently purchased. Even\nthat hideous stair-carpet was a little worn, she noted, as noiselessly\nshe mounted to the second story.\n\nThe house was perfectly quiet, save for a tiny shrill continuance of\nmelody that somehow seemed only to pierce the silence, not to dispel it.\nRudolph--of all things!--had in her absence acquired a canary. And\neverybody knew what an interminable nuisance a canary was.\n\nShe entered the front room. It had been her bedroom ever since her\nmarriage. She remembered this as with a gush of defiant joy.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nSo it seemed to Rudolph Musgrave that Patricia came actually into the\nroom that had been hers....\n\nA canary was singing there, very sweet and shrill and as in defiant joy.\nIts trilling seemed to fill the room. In the brief pauses of his song\nthe old clock, from which Rudolph had removed the pendulum on the night\nof Agatha's death would interpose an obstinate slow ticking; and\nimmediately the clock-noise would be drowned in melody. Otherwise the\nroom was silent.\n\nIn the alcove stood the bed which had been Patricia's. Intent upon its\noccupant were three persons, with their backs turned to her. One\nPatricia could easily divine to be a doctor; he was twiddling a\nhypodermic syringe between his fingers, and the set of his shoulders was\nthat of acquiescence. Profiles of the others she saw: one a passive\nnurse in uniform, who was patiently chafing the right hand of the bed's\noccupant; the other a lean-featured red-haired stranger, who sat\ncrouched in his chair and held the dying man's left hand.\n\nFor in the bed, supported by many pillows, and facing Patricia, was a\ndying man. He was very old, having thick tumbled hair which, like his\ntwo-weeks' beard, was uniformly white. His eyelids drooped a trifle, so\nthat he seemed to meditate concerning something ineffably remote and\nserious, yet not, upon the whole, unsatisfactory. You saw and heard the\nintake of each breath, so painfully drawn, and expelled with manifest\nrelief, as if the man were very tired of breathing. Yet the bedclothes\nheaved with his vain efforts just to keep on breathing. And sometimes\nhis parted lips would twitch curiously.... Rudolph Musgrave, too, could\nsee all this quite plainly, in the mirror over the mantel.\n\nThe doctor spoke. \"Yes--it's the end, Professor Musgrave,\" he said. For\nthis lean-featured red-haired stranger to whom the doctor spoke, a\npedagogue to his finger-tips, had once been Patricia's dearly-purchased,\nchubby baby Roger.\n\nAnd Rudolph Musgrave stayed motionless. He knew Patricia was there; but\nthat fact no longer seemed either very strange or even unnatural; and\nbesides, it was against some law for him to look at her until Patricia\nhad called him.... Meanwhile, just opposite, above the mirror, and\nfacing him, was the Stuart portrait of young Gerald Musgrave. This\npicture had now hung there for a great many years. The boy still smiled\nat you in undiminished raillery, even though he smiled ambiguously, and\nwith a sort of humorous sadness in his eyes. Once, very long ago--when\nthe picture hung downstairs--some one had said that Gerald Musgrave's\nlife was barren. The dying man could not now recollect, quite, who that\nperson was.\n\nRudolph Musgrave stayed motionless. He comprehended that he was dying.\nThe greatest of all changes was at hand; and he, who had always shrunk\nfrom making changes, was now content enough.... Indeed, with Rudolph\nMusgrave living had always been a vaguely dissatisfactory business, a\nhand-to-mouth proceeding which he had scrambled through, as he saw now,\nwithout any worthy aim or even any intelligible purpose. He had nothing\nvery heinous with which to reproach himself; but upon the other side, he\nhad most certainly nothing of which to be particularly proud.\n\nSo this was all that living came to! You heard of other people being\nrapt by splendid sins and splendid virtues, and you anticipated that\nto-morrow some such majestic energy would transfigure your own living,\nand change everything: but the great adventure never arrived, somehow;\nand the days were frittered away piecemeal, what with eating your\ndinner, and taking a wholesome walk, and checking up your bank account,\nand dovetailing scraps of parish registers and land-patents and county\nrecords into an irrefutable pedigree, and seeing that your clothes were\npressed, and looking over the newspapers--and what with other\ninfinitesimal avocations, each one innocent, none of any particular\nimportance, and each consuming an irrevocable moment of the allotted\ntime--until at last you found that living had not, necessarily, any\nclimax at all.... And Patricia would call him presently.\n\nOnce, very long ago, some one had said that the most pathetic tragedy in\nlife was to get nothing in particular out of it. The dying man could not\nnow recollect, quite, who that person was.\n\nHe wondered, vaguely, what might have been the outcome if Rudolph\nMusgrave had whole-heartedly sought, not waited for, the great\nadventure; if Rudolph Musgrave had put--however irrationally--more\nenergy and less second-thought into living; if Rudolph Musgrave had not\nbeen contented to be just a Musgrave of Matocton.... Well, it was too\nlate now. He viewed his whole life now, in epitome, and much as you may\nsee at night the hackneyed vista from your window leap to incisiveness\nunder the lash of lightning. No, the life of Rudolph Musgrave had never\nrisen to the plane of dignity, not even to that of seeming to Rudolph\nMusgrave a connected and really important transaction on Rudolph\nMusgrave's part. Yet Lichfield, none the better for Rudolph Musgrave's\nhaving lived, was none the worse, thank heaven! And there were younger\nmen in Lichfield--men who did not mean to fail as Rudolph Musgrave and\nhis fellows all had failed.... Eh, yes, what was the toast that Rudolph\nMusgrave drank, so long ago, to the new Lichfield which these younger\nmen were making?\n\n\"To this new South, that has not any longer need of me or of my kind.\n\n\"To this new South! She does not gaze unwillingly, nor too complacently,\nupon old years, and dares concede that but with loss of manliness may\nany man encroach upon the heritage of a dog or of a trotting-horse, and\nconsider the exploits of an ancestor to guarantee an innate and personal\nexcellence.\n\n\"For to her all former glory is less a jewel than a touchstone, and with\nher portion of it daily she appraises her own doing, and without vain\nspeech. And her high past she values now, in chief, as fit foundation of\nthat edifice whereon she labors day by day, and with augmenting\nstrokes.\"\n\nYes, that was it. And it was true. Yet Rudolph Musgrave's life on earth\nwas ending now--the only life that he would ever have on earth--and it\nhad never risen to the plane of seeming even to Rudolph Musgrave a\nreally important transaction on Rudolph Musgrave's part....\n\nThen Patricia spoke. Low and very low she called to Olaf, and the dim,\nwistful eyes of Rudolph Musgrave lifted, and gazed full upon her\nstanding there, and were no longer wistful. And the man made as though\nto rise, and could not, and his face was very glad.\n\nFor in the dying man had awakened the pulses of an old, strange,\nhalf-forgotten magic, and all his old delight in the girl who had shared\nin and had provoked this ancient wonder-working, together with a quite\nnew consciousness of the inseparability of Patricia's foibles from his\nexistence; so that he was incuriously aware of his imbecility in not\nhaving known always that Patricia must come back some day, not as a\nglorious, unfamiliar angel, but unaltered.\n\n\"I am glad you haven't changed.... Why, but of course! Nothing would\nhave counted if you had changed--not even for the better, Patricia. For\nyou and what you meant to me were real. That only was real--that we, not\nbeing demigods, but being just what we were, once climbed together very\nhigh, where we could glimpse the stars--and nothing else can ever be of\nany importance. What we inherited was too much for us, was it not, my\ndear? And now it is not formidable any longer. Oh, but I loved you very\ngreatly, Patricia! And now at last, my dear, I seem to understand--as in\nthat old, old time when you and I were glad together----\"\n\nBut he did not say this aloud, for it seemed to him that he stood in a\ncool, pleasant garden, and that Patricia came toward him through the\nlong shadows of sunset. The lacy folds and furbelows and\nsemi-transparencies that clothed her were now tinged with gold and now,\nas a hedge or a flower bed screened her from the level rays, were\nsoftened into multitudinous graduations of grays and mauves and violets.\n\nThey did not speak. But in her eyes he found compassion and such\ntenderness as awed him; and then, as a light is puffed out, they were\nthe eyes of a friendly stranger. He understood, for an instant, that of\nnecessity it was decreed time must turn back and everything, even\nRudolph Musgrave, be just as it had been when he first saw Patricia. For\nthey had made nothing of their lives; and so, they must begin all over\nagain.\n\n\"_Failure is not permitted_\" he was saying....\n\n\"_You're Cousin Rudolph, aren't you?_\" she asked....\n\nAnd Rudolph Musgrave knew he had forgotten something of vast import, but\nwhat this knowledge had pertained to he no longer knew. Then Rudolph\nMusgrave noted, with a delicious tingling somewhere about his heart,\nthat her hair was like the reflection of a sunset in rippling\nwaters--only many times more beautiful, of course--and that her mouth\nwas an inconsiderable trifle, a scrap of sanguine curves, and that her\neyes were purple glimpses of infinity.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck\nby James Branch Cabell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RIVET IN GRANDFATHER'S NECK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10041-8.txt or 10041-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/0/4/10041/\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Dave Morgan and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n"}
