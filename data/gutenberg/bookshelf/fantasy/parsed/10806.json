I have never seen\na city in the world so beautiful as Merimna seemed to me when first\nI dreamed of it.  It was a marvel of spires and figures of bronze,\nand marble fountains, and trophies of fabulous wars, and broad\nstreets given over wholly to the Beautiful.  Right through the\ncentre of the city there went an avenue fifty strides in width, and\nalong each side of it stood likenesses in bronze of the Kings of all\nthe countries that the people of Merimna had ever known.  At the end\nof that avenue was a colossal chariot with three bronze horses\ndriven by the winged figure of Fame, and behind her in the chariot\nthe huge form of Welleran, Merimna's ancient hero, standing with\nextended sword.  So urgent was the mien and attitude of Fame, and so\nswift the pose of the horses, that you had sworn that the chariot\nwas instantly upon you, and that its dust already veiled the faces\nof the Kings.  And in the city was a mighty hall wherein were stored\nthe trophies of Merimna's heroes.  Sculptured it was and domed, the\nglory of the art of masons a long while dead, and on the summit of\nthe dome the image of Rollory sat gazing across the Cyresian\nmountains towards the wide lands beyond, the lands that knew his\nsword.  And beside Rollory, like an old nurse, the figure of Victory\nsat, hammering into a golden wreath of laurels for his head the\ncrowns of fallen Kings.\n\nSuch was Merimna, a city of sculptured Victories and warriors of\nbronze.  Yet in the time of which I write the art of war had been\nforgotten in Merimna, and the people almost slept.  To and fro and\nup and down they would walk through the marble streets, gazing at\nmemorials of the things achieved by their country's swords in the\nhands of those that long ago had loved Merimna well.  Almost they\nslept, and dreamed of Welleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory,\nAkanax, and young Iraine.  Of the lands beyond the mountains that\nlay all round about them they knew nothing, save that they were the\ntheatre of the terrible deeds of Welleran, that he had done with his\nsword.  Long since these lands had fallen back into the possession\nof the nations that had been scourged by Merimna's armies.  Nothing\nnow remained to Merimna's men save their inviolate city and the\nglory of the remembrance of their ancient fame.  At night they would\nplace sentinels far out in the desert, but these always slept at\ntheir posts dreaming of Rollory, and three times every night a guard\nwould march around the city clad in purple, bearing lights and\nsinging songs of Welleran.  Always the guard went unarmed, but as the\nsound of their song went echoing across the plain towards the\nlooming mountains, the desert robbers would hear the name of\nWelleran and steal away to their haunts.  Often dawn would come\nacross the plain, shimmering marvellously upon Merimna's spires,\nabashing all the stars, and find the guard still singing songs of\nWelleran, and would change the colour of their purple robes and pale\nthe lights they bore.  But the guard would go back leaving the\nramparts safe, and one by one the sentinels in the plain would awake\nfrom dreaming of Rollory and shuffle back into the city quite cold.\nThen something of the menace would pass away from the faces of the\nCyresian mountains, that from the north and the west and the south\nlowered upon Merimna, and clear in the morning the statues and the\npillars would arise in the old inviolate city.  You would wonder that\nan unarmed guard and sentinels that slept could defend a city that\nwas stored with all the glories of art, that was rich in gold and\nbronze, a haughty city that had erst oppressed its neighbours, whose\npeople had forgotten the art of war.  Now this is the reason that,\nthough all her other lands had long been taken from her, Merimna's\ncity was safe.  A strange thing was believed or feared by the fierce\ntribes beyond the mountains, and it was credited among them that at\ncertain stations round Merimna's ramparts there still rode Welleran,\nSoorenard, Mommolek, Rollory, Akanax, and young Iraine.  Yet it was\nclose on a hundred years since Iraine, the youngest of Merimna's\nheroes, fought his last battle with the tribes.\n\nSometimes indeed there arose among the tribes young men who doubted\nand said: 'How may a man for ever escape death?'\n\nBut graver men answered them: 'Hear us, ye whose wisdom has\ndiscerned so much, and discern for us how a man may escape death\nwhen two score horsemen assail him with their swords, all of them\nsworn to kill him, and all of them sworn upon their country's gods;\nas often Welleran hath.  Or discern for us how two men alone may\nenter a walled city by night, and bring away from it that city's\nking, as did Soorenard and Mommolek.  Surely men that have escaped\nso many swords and so many sleety arrows shall escape the years and\nTime.'\n\nAnd the young men were humbled and became silent.  Still, the\nsuspicion grew.  And often when the sun set on the Cyresian\nmountains, men in Merimna discerned the forms of savage tribesmen\nblack against the light, peering towards the city.\n\nAll knew in Merimna that the figures round the ramparts were only\nstatues of stone, yet even there a hope lingered among a few that\nsome day their old heroes would come again, for certainly none had\never seen them die.  Now it had been the wont of these six warriors\nof old, as each received his last wound and knew it to be mortal, to\nride away to a certain deep ravine and cast his body in, as\nsomewhere I have read great elephants do, hiding their bones away\nfrom lesser beasts.  It was a ravine steep and narrow even at the\nends, a great cleft into which no man could come by any path.  There\nrode Welleran alone, panting hard; and there later rode Soorenard\nand Mommolek, Mommolek with a mortal wound upon him not to return,\nbut Soorenard was unwounded and rode back alone from leaving his\ndear friend resting among the mighty bones of Welleran.  And there\nrode Soorenard, when his day was come, with Rollory and Akanax, and\nRollory rode in the middle and Soorenard and Akanax on either side.\nAnd the long ride was a hard and weary thing for Soorenard and\nAkanax, for they both had mortal wounds; but the long ride was easy\nfor Rollory, for he was dead.  So the bones of these five heroes\nwhitened in an enemy's land, and very still they were, though they\nhad troubled cities, and none knew where they lay saving only\nIraine, the young captain, who was but twenty-five when Mommolek,\nRollory, and Akanax rode away.  And among them were strewn their\nsaddles and their bridles, and all the accoutrements of their\nhorses, lest any man should ever find them afterwards and say in\nsome foreign city: 'Lo! the bridles or the saddles of Merimna's\ncaptains, taken in war,' but their beloved trusty horses they turned\nfree.\n\nForty years afterwards, in the hour of a great victory, his last\nwound came upon Iraine, and the wound was terrible and would not\nclose.  And Iraine was the last of the captains, and rode away\nalone.  It was a long way to the dark ravine, and Iraine feared that\nhe would never come to the resting-place of the old heroes, and he\nurged his horse on swiftly, and clung to the saddle with his hands.\nAnd often as he rode he fell asleep, and dreamed of earlier days,\nand of the times when he first rode forth to the great wars of\nWelleran, and of the time when Welleran first spake to him, and of\nthe faces of Welleran's comrades when they led charges in the\nbattle.  And ever as he awoke a great longing arose in his soul as\nit hovered on his body's brink, a longing to lie among the bones of\nthe old heroes.  At last when he saw the dark ravine making a scar\nacross the plain, the soul of Iraine slipped out through his great\nwound and spread its wings, and pain departed from the poor hacked\nbody, and, still urging his horse forward, Iraine died.  But the old\ntrue horse cantered on till suddenly he saw before him the dark\nravine and put his forefeet out on the very edge of it and stopped.\nThen the body of Iraine came toppling forward over the right\nshoulder of the horse, and his bones mingle and rest as the years go\nby with the bones of Merimna's heroes.\n\nNow there was a little boy in Merimna named Rold.  I saw him first,\nI, the dreamer, that sit before my fire asleep, I saw him first as\nhis mother led him through the great hall where stand the trophies\nof Merimna's heroes.  He was five years old, and they stood before\nthe great glass casket wherein lay the sword of Welleran, and his\nmother said: 'The sword of Welleran.'  And Rold said: 'What should a\nman do with the sword of Welleran?'  And his mother answered: 'Men\nlook at the sword and remember Welleran.'  And they went on and\nstood before the great red cloak of Welleran, and the child said:\n'Why did Welleran wear this great red cloak?' And his mother\nanswered: 'It was the way of Welleran.'\n\nWhen Rold was a little older he stole out of his mother's house\nquite in the middle of the night when all the world was still, and\nMerimna asleep dreaming of Welleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory,\nAkanax, and young Iraine.  And he went down to the ramparts to hear\nthe purple guard go by singing of Welleran.  And the purple guard\ncame by with lights, all singing in the stillness, and dark shapes\nout in the desert turned and fled.  And Rold went back again to his\nmother's house with a great yearning towards the name of Welleran,\nsuch as men feel for very holy things.\n\nAnd in time Rold grew to know the pathway all round the ramparts,\nand the six equestrian statues that were there guarding Merimna\nstill.  These statues were not like other statues, they were so\ncunningly wrought of many-coloured marbles that none might be quite\nsure until very close that they were not living men.  There was a\nhorse of dappled marble, the horse of Akanax.  The horse of Rollory\nwas of alabaster, pure white, his armour was wrought out of a stone\nthat shone, and his horseman's cloak was made of a blue stone, very\nprecious.  He looked northwards.\n\nBut the marble horse of Welleran was pure black, and there sat\nWelleran upon him looking solemnly westwards.  His horse it was\nwhose cold neck Rold most loved to stroke, and it was Welleran whom\nthe watchers at sunset on the mountains the most clearly saw as they\npeered towards the city.  And Rold loved the red nostrils of the\ngreat black horse and his rider's jasper cloak.\n\nNow beyond the Cyresians the suspicion grew that Merimna's heroes\nwere dead, and a plan was devised that a man should go by night and\ncome close to the figures upon the ramparts and see whether they\nwere Welleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory, Akanax, and young\nIraine.  And all were agreed upon the plan, and many names were\nmentioned of those who should go, and the plan matured for many\nyears.  It was during these years that watchers clustered often at\nsunset upon the mountains but came no nearer.  Finally, a better\nplan was made, and it was decided that two men who had been by\nchance condemned to death should be given a pardon if they went down\ninto the plain by night and discovered whether or not Merimna's\nheroes lived.  At first the two prisoners dared not go, but after a\nwhile one of them, Seejar, said to his companion, Sajar-Ho: 'See\nnow, when the King's axeman smites a man upon the neck that man\ndies.'\n\nAnd the other said that this was so.  Then said Seejar: 'And even\nthough Welleran smite a man with his sword no more befalleth him\nthan death.'\n\nThen Sajar-Ho thought for a while.  Presently he said: 'Yet the eye\nof the King's axeman might err at the moment of his stroke or his\narm fail him, and the eye of Welleran hath never erred nor his arm\nfailed.  It were better to bide here.'\n\nThen said Seejar: 'Maybe that Welleran is dead and that some other\nholds his place upon the ramparts, or even a statue of stone.'\n\nBut Sajar-Ho made answer: 'How can Welleran be dead when he even\nescaped from two score horsemen with swords that were sworn to slay\nhim, and all sworn upon our country's gods?'\n\nAnd Seejar said: 'This story his father told my grandfather\nconcerning Welleran.  On the day that the fight was lost on the\nplains of Kurlistan he saw a dying horse near to the river, and the\nhorse looked piteously towards the water but could not reach it.\nAnd the father of my grandfather saw Welleran go down to the river's\nbrink and bring water from it with his own hand and give it to the\nhorse.  Now we are in as sore a plight as was that horse, and as\nnear to death; it may be that Welleran will pity us, while the\nKing's axeman cannot because of the commands of the King.'\n\nThen said Sajar-Ho: 'Thou wast ever a cunning arguer.  Thou\nbroughtest us into this trouble with thy cunning and thy devices, we\nwill see if thou canst bring us out of it.  We will go.'\n\nSo news was brought to the King that the two prisoners would go down\nto Merimna.\n\nThat evening the watchers led them to the mountain's edge, and\nSeejar and Sajar-Ho went down towards the plain by the way of a deep\nravine, and the watchers watched them go.  Presently their figures\nwere wholly hid in the dusk.  Then night came up, huge and holy, out\nof waste marshes to the eastwards and low lands and the sea; and the\nangels that watched over all men through the day closed their great\neyes and slept, and the angels that watched over all men through the\nnight awoke and ruffled their deep blue feathers and stood up and\nwatched.  But the plain became a thing of mystery filled with fears.\nSo the two spies went down the deep ravine, and coming to the plain\nsped stealthily across it.  Soon they came to the line of sentinels\nasleep upon the sand, and one stirred in his sleep calling on\nRollory, and a great dread seized upon the spies and they whispered\n'Rollory lives,' but they remembered the King's axeman and went on.\nAnd next they came to the great bronze statue of Fear, carved by\nsome sculptor of the old glorious years in the attitude of flight\ntowards the mountains, calling to her children as she fled.  And the\nchildren of Fear were carved in the likeness of the armies of all\nthe trans-Cyresian tribes with their backs towards Merimna, flocking\nafter Fear.  And from where he sat on his horse behind the ramparts\nthe sword of Welleran was stretched out over their heads as ever it\nwas wont.  And the two spies kneeled down in the sand and kissed the\nhuge bronze foot of the statue of Fear, saying: 'O Fear, Fear.'  And\nas they knelt they saw lights far off along the ramparts coming\nnearer and nearer, and heard men singing of Welleran.  And the\npurple guard came nearer and went by with their lights, and passed\non into the distance round the ramparts still singing of Welleran.\nAnd all the while the two spies clung to the foot of the statue,\nmuttering: 'O Fear, Fear.'  But when they could hear the name of\nWelleran no more they arose and came to the ramparts and climbed\nover them and came at once upon the figure of Welleran, and they\nbowed low to the ground, and Seejar said: 'O Welleran, we came to\nsee whether thou didst yet live.'  And for a long while they waited\nwith their faces to the earth.  At last Seejar looked up towards\nWelleran's terrible sword, and it was still stretched out pointing\nto the carved armies that followed after Fear.  And Seejar bowed to\nthe ground again and touched the horse's hoof, and it seemed cold to\nhim.  And he moved his hand higher and touched the leg of the horse,\nand it seemed quite cold.  At last he touched Welleran's foot, and\nthe armour on it seemed hard and stiff.  Then as Welleran moved not\nand spake not, Seejar climbed up at last and touched his hand, the\nterrible hand of Welleran, and it was marble.  Then Seejar laughed\naloud, and he and Sajar-Ho sped down the empty pathway and found\nRollory, and he was marble too.  Then they climbed down over the\nramparts and went back across the plain, walking contemptuously past\nthe figure of Fear, and heard the guard returning round the ramparts\nfor the third time, singing of Welleran; and Seejar said: 'Ay, you\nmay sing of Welleran, but Welleran is dead and a doom is on your\ncity.'\n\nAnd they passed on and found the sentinel still restless in the\nnight and calling on Rollory.  And Sajar-Ho muttered: 'Ay, you may\ncall on Rollory, but Rollory is dead and naught can save your city.'\n\nAnd the two spies went back alive to their mountains again, and as\nthey reached them the first ray of the sun came up red over the\ndesert behind Merimna and lit Merimna's spires.  It was the hour\nwhen the purple guard were wont to go back into the city with their\ntapers pale and their robes a brighter colour, when the cold\nsentinels came shuffling in from dreaming in the desert; it was the\nhour when the desert robbers hid themselves away, going back to\ntheir mountain caves; it was the hour when gauze-winged insects are\nborn that only live for a day; it was the hour when men die that are\ncondemned to death; and in this hour a great peril, new and\nterrible, arose for Merimna and Merimna knew it not.\n\nThen Seejar turning said: 'See how red the dawn is and how red the\nspires of Merimna.  They are angry with Merimna in Paradise and they\nbode its doom.'\n\nSo the two spies went back and brought the news to their King, and\nfor a few days the Kings of those countries were gathering their\narmies together; and one evening the armies of four Kings were\nmassed together at the top of the deep ravine, all crouching below\nthe summit waiting for the sun to set.  All wore resolute and\nfearless faces, yet inwardly every man was praying to his gods, unto\neach one in turn.\n\nThen the sun set, and it was the hour when the bats and the dark\ncreatures are abroad and the lions come down from their lairs, and\nthe desert robbers go into the plains again, and fevers rise up\nwinged and hot out of chill marshes, and it was the hour when safety\nleaves the thrones of Kings, the hour when dynasties change.  But in\nthe desert the purple guard came swinging out of Merimna with their\nlights to sing of Welleran, and the sentinels lay down to sleep.\n\nNow into Paradise no sorrow may ever come, but may only beat like\nrain against its crystal walls, yet the souls of Merimna's heroes\nwere half aware of some sorrow far away as some sleeper feels that\nsome one is chilled and cold yet knows not in his sleep that it is\nhe.  And they fretted a little in their starry home.  Then unseen\nthere drifted earthward across the setting sun the souls of\nWelleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory, Akanax, and young Iraine.\nAlready when they reached Merimna's ramparts it was just dark,\nalready the armies of the four Kings had begun to move, jingling,\ndown the deep ravine.  But when the six warriors saw their city\nagain, so little changed after so many years, they looked towards\nher with a longing that was nearer to tears than any that their\nsouls had known before, crying to her:\n\n'O Merimna, our city: Merimna, our walled city.\n\n'How beautiful thou art with all thy spires, Merimna.  For thee we\nleft the earth, its kingdoms and little flowers, for thee we have\ncome away for awhile from Paradise.\n\n'It is very difficult to draw away from the face of God--it is\nlike a warm fire, it is like dear sleep, it is like a great anthem,\nyet there is a stillness all about it, a stillness full of lights.\n\n'We have left Paradise for awhile for thee, Merimna.\n\n'Many women have we loved, Merimna, but only one city.\n\n'Behold now all the people dream, all our loved people.  How\nbeautiful are dreams!  In dreams the dead may live, even the long\ndead and the very silent.  Thy lights are all sunk low, they have\nall gone out, no sound is in thy streets.  Hush!  Thou art like a\nmaiden that shutteth up her eyes and is asleep, that draweth her\nbreath softly and is quite still, being at ease and untroubled.\n\n'Behold now the battlements, the old battlements.  Do men defend\nthem still as we defended them?  They are worn a little, the\nbattlements,' and drifting nearer they peered anxiously.  'It is not\nby the hand of man that they are worn, our battlements.  Only the\nyears have done it and indomitable Time.  Thy battlements are like\nthe girdle of a maiden, a girdle that is round about her.  See now\nthe dew upon them, they are like a jewelled girdle.\n\n'Thou art in great danger, Merimna, because thou art so beautiful.\nMust thou perish tonight because we no more defend thee, because we\ncry out and none hear us, as the bruised lilies cry out and none\nhave known their voices?'\n\nThus spake those strong-voiced, battle-ordering captains, calling to\ntheir dear city, and their voices came no louder than the whispers\nof little bats that drift across the twilight in the evening.  Then\nthe purple guard came near, going round the ramparts for the first\ntime in the night, and the old warriors called to them, 'Merimna is\nin danger! Already her enemies gather in the darkness.'  But their\nvoices were never heard because they were only wandering ghosts.\nAnd the guard went by and passed unheeding away, still singing of\nWelleran.\n\nThen said Welleran to his comrades: 'Our hands can hold swords no\nmore, our voices cannot be heard, we are stalwart men no longer.  We\nare but dreams, let us go among dreams.  Go all of you, and thou too,\nyoung Iraine, and trouble the dreams of all the men that sleep, and\nurge them to take the old swords of their grandsires that hang upon\nthe walls, and to gather at the mouth of the ravine; and I will find\na leader and make him take my sword.'\n\nThen they passed up over the ramparts and into their dear city.  And\nthe wind blew about, this way and that, as he went, the soul of\nWelleran who had upon his day withstood the charges of tempestuous\narmies.  And the souls of his comrades, and with them young Iraine,\npassed up into the city and troubled the dreams of every man who\nslept, and to every man the souls said in their dreams: 'It is hot\nand still in the city.  Go out now into the desert, into the cool\nunder the mountains, but take with thee the old sword that hangs\nupon the wall for fear of the desert robbers.'\n\nAnd the god of that city sent up a fever over it, and the fever\nbrooded over it and the streets were hot; and all that slept awoke\nfrom dreaming that it would be cool and pleasant where the breezes\ncame down the ravine out of the mountains; and they took the old\nswords that their grandsires had, according to their dreams, for\nfear of the desert robbers.  And in and out of dreams passed the\nsouls of Welleran's comrades, and with them young Iraine, in great\nhaste as the night wore on; and one by one they troubled the dreams\nof all Merimna's men and caused them to arise and go out armed, all\nsave the purple guard who, heedless of danger, sang of Welleran\nstill, for waking men cannot hear the souls of the dead.\n\nBut Welleran drifted over the roofs of the city till he came to the\nform of Rold lying fast asleep.  Now Rold was grown strong and was\neighteen years of age, and he was fair of hair and tall like\nWelleran, and the soul of Welleran hovered over him and went into\nhis dreams as a butterfly flits through trellis-work into a garden\nof flowers, and the soul of Welleran said to Rold in his dreams:\n'Thou wouldst go and see again the sword of Welleran, the great\ncurved sword of Welleran.  Thou wouldst go and look at it in the\nnight with the moonlight shining upon it.'\n\nAnd the longing of Rold in his dreams to see the sword caused him to\nwalk still sleeping from his mother's house to the hall wherein were\nthe trophies of the heroes.  And the soul of Welleran urging the\ndreams of Rold caused him to pause before the great red cloak, and\nthere the soul said among the dreams: 'Thou art cold in the night;\nfling now a cloak around thee.'\n\nAnd Rold drew round about him the huge red cloak of Welleran.  Then\nRold's dreams took him to the sword, and the soul said to the\ndreams: 'Thou hast a longing to hold the sword of Welleran: take up\nthe sword in thy hand.'\n\nBut Rold said: 'What should a man do with the sword of Welleran?'\n\nAnd the soul of the old captain said to the dreams: 'It is a good\nsword to hold: take up the sword of Welleran.'\n\nAnd Rold, still sleeping and speaking aloud, said: 'It is not\nlawful; none may touch the sword.'\n\nAnd Rold turned to go.  Then a great and terrible cry arose in the\nsoul of Welleran, all the more bitter for that he could not utter\nit, and it went round and round his soul finding no utterance, like\na cry evoked long since by some murderous deed in some old haunted\nchamber that whispers through the ages heard by none.\n\nAnd the soul of Welleran cried out to the dreams of Rold: 'Thy knees\nare tied!  Thou art fallen in a marsh!  Thou canst not move.'\n\nAnd the dreams of Rold said to him: 'Thy knees are tied, thou art\nfallen in a marsh,' and Rold stood still before the sword.  Then the\nsoul of the warrior wailed among Rold's dreams, as Rold stood before\nthe sword.\n\n'Welleran is crying for his sword, his wonderful curved sword.  Poor\nWelleran, that once fought for Merimna, is crying for his sword in\nthe night.  Thou wouldst not keep Welleran without his beautiful\nsword when he is dead and cannot come for it, poor Welleran who\nfought for Merimna.'\n\nAnd Rold broke the glass casket with his hand and took the sword,\nthe great curved sword of Welleran; and the soul of the warrior said\namong Rold's dreams: 'Welleran is waiting in the deep ravine that\nruns into the mountains, crying for his sword.'\n\nAnd Rold went down through the city and climbed over the ramparts,\nand walked with his eyes wide open but still sleeping over the\ndesert to the mountains.\n\nAlready a great multitude of Merimna's citizens were gathered in the\ndesert before the deep ravine with old swords in their hands, and\nRold passed through them as he slept holding the sword of Welleran,\nand the people cried in amaze to one another as he passed: 'Rold\nhath the sword of Welleran!'\n\nAnd Rold came to the mouth of the ravine, and there the voices of\nthe people woke him.  And Rold knew nothing that he had done in his\nsleep, and looked in amazement at the sword in his hand and said:\n'What art thou, thou beautiful thing?  Lights shimmer in thee, thou\nart restless.  It is the sword of Welleran, the curved sword of\nWelleran!'\n\nAnd Rold kissed the hilt of it, and it was salt upon his lips with\nthe battle-sweat of Welleran.  And Rold said: 'What should a man do\nwith the sword of Welleran?'\n\nAnd all the people wondered at Rold as he sat there with the sword\nin his hand muttering, 'What should a man do with the sword of\nWelleran?'\n\nPresently there came to the ears of Rold the noise of a jingling up\nin the ravine, and all the people, the people that knew naught of\nwar, heard the jingling coming nearer in the night; for the four\narmies were moving on Merimna and not yet expecting an enemy.  And\nRold gripped upon the hilt of the great curved sword, and the sword\nseemed to lift a little.  And a new thought came into the hearts of\nMerimna's people as they gripped their grandsires' swords.  Nearer\nand nearer came the heedless armies of the four Kings, and old\nancestral memories began to arise in the minds of Merimna's people\nin the desert with their swords in their hands sitting behind Rold.\nAnd all the sentinels were awake holding their spears, for Rollory\nhad put their dreams to flight, Rollory that once could put to\nflight armies and now was but a dream struggling with other dreams.\n\nAnd now the armies had come very near.  Suddenly Rold leaped up,\ncrying: 'Welleran!  And the sword of Welleran!' And the savage,\nlusting sword that had thirsted for a hundred years went up with the\nhand of Rold and swept through a tribesman's ribs.  And with the\nwarm blood all about it there came a joy into the curved soul of\nthat mighty sword, like to the joy of a swimmer coming up dripping\nout of warm seas after living for long in a dry land.  When they saw\nthe red cloak and that terrible sword a cry ran through the tribal\narmies, 'Welleran lives!'  And there arose the sounds of the exulting\nof victorious men, and the panting of those that fled, and the sword\nsinging softly to itself as it whirled dripping through the air.\nAnd the last that I saw of the battle as it poured into the depth\nand darkness of the ravine was the sword of Welleran sweeping up and\nfalling, gleaming blue in the moonlight whenever it arose and\nafterwards gleaming red, and so disappearing into the darkness.\n\nBut in the dawn Merimna's men came back, and the sun arising to give\nnew life to the world, shone instead upon the hideous things that\nthe sword of Welleran had done.  And Rold said: 'O sword, sword!\nHow horrible thou art!  Thou art a terrible thing to have come among\nmen.  How many eyes shall look upon gardens no more because of thee?\nHow many fields must go empty that might have been fair with\ncottages, white cottages with children all about them?  How many\nvalleys must go desolate that might have nursed warm hamlets,\nbecause thou hast slain long since the men that might have built\nthem?  I hear the wind crying against thee, thou sword!  It comes\nfrom the empty valleys.  It comes over the bare fields.  There are\nchildren's voices in it.  They were never born.  Death brings an end\nto crying for those that had life once, but these must cry for ever.\nO sword! sword! why did the gods send thee among men?'  And the\ntears of Rold fell down upon the proud sword but could not wash it\nclean.\n\nAnd now that the ardour of battle had passed away, the spirits of\nMerimna's people began to gloom a little, like their leader's, with\ntheir fatigue and with the cold of the morning; and they looked at\nthe sword of Welleran in Rold's hand and said: 'Not any more, not\nany more for ever will Welleran now return, for his sword is in the\nhand of another.  Now we know indeed that he is dead.  O Welleran,\nthou wast our sun and moon and all our stars.  Now is the sun fallen\ndown and the moon broken, and all the stars are scattered as the\ndiamonds of a necklace that is snapped off one who is slain by\nviolence.'\n\nThus wept the people of Merimna in the hour of their great victory,\nfor men have strange moods, while beside them their old inviolate\ncity slumbered safe.  But back from the ramparts and beyond the\nmountains and over the lands that they had conquered of old, beyond\nthe world and back again to Paradise, went the souls of Welleran,\nSoorenard, Mommolek, Rollory, Akanax, and young Iraine.\n\n\n\n\nThe Fall of Babbulkund\n\nI said: 'I will arise now and see Babbulkund, City of Marvel.  She is\nof one age with the earth; the stars are her sisters.  Pharaohs of\nthe old time coming conquering from Araby first saw her, a solitary\nmountain in the desert, and cut the mountain into towers and\nterraces.  They destroyed one of the hills of God, but they made\nBabbulkund.  She is carven, not built; her palaces are one with her\nterraces, there is neither join nor cleft.  Hers is the beauty of the\nyouth of the world.  She deemeth herself to be the middle of Earth,\nand hath four gates facing outward to the Nations.  There sits\noutside her eastern gate a colossal god of stone.  His face flushes\nwith the lights of dawn.  When the morning sunlight warms his lips\nthey part a little, and he giveth utterance to the words \"Oon Oom,\"\nand the language is long since dead in which he speaks, and all his\nworshippers are gathered to their tombs, so that none knoweth what\nthe words portend that he uttereth at dawn.  Some say that he greets\nthe sun as one god greets another in the language thereof, and\nothers say that he proclaims the day, and others that he uttereth\nwarning.  And at every gate is a marvel not credible until beholden.'\n\nAnd I gathered three friends and said to them: 'We are what we have\nseen and known.  Let us journey now and behold Babbulkund, that our\nminds may be beautified with it and our spirits made holier.'\n\nSo we took ship and travelled over the lifting sea, and remembered\nnot things done in the towns we knew, but laid away the thoughts of\nthem like soiled linen and put them by, and dreamed of Babbulkund.\n\nBut when we came to the land of which Babbulkund is the abiding\nglory, we hired a caravan of camels and Arab guides, and passed\nsouthwards in the afternoon on the three days' journey through the\ndesert that should bring us to the white walls of Babbulkund.  And\nthe heat of the sun shone upon us out of the bright grey sky, and\nthe heat of the desert beat up at us from below.\n\nAbout sunset we halted and tethered our horses, while the Arabs\nunloaded the provisions from the camels and prepared a fire out of\nthe dry scrub, for at sunset the heat of the desert departs from it\nsuddenly, like a bird.  Then we saw a traveller approaching us on a\ncamel coming from the south.  When he was come near we said to him:\n\n'Come and encamp among us, for in the desert all men are brothers,\nand we will give thee meat to eat and wine, or, if thou art bound by\nthy faith, we will give thee some other drink that is not accursed\nby the prophet.'\n\nThe traveller seated himself beside us on the sand, and crossed his\nlegs and answered:\n\n'Hearken, and I will tell you of Babbulkund, City of Marvel.\nBabbulkund stands just below the meeting of the rivers, where\nOonrana, River of Myth, flows into the Waters of Fable, even the old\nstream Pleg\u00e1thanees.  These, together, enter her northern gate\nrejoicing.  Of old they flowed in the dark through the Hill that\nNehemoth, the first of Pharaohs, carved into the City of Marvel.\nSterile and desolate they float far through the desert, each in the\nappointed cleft, with life upon neither bank, but give birth in\nBabbulkund to the sacred purple garden whereof all nations sing.\nThither all the bees come on a pilgrimage at evening by a secret way\nof the air.  Once, from his twilit kingdom, which he rules equally\nwith the sun, the moon saw and loved Babbulkund, clad with her\npurple garden; and the moon wooed Babbulkund, and she sent him\nweeping away, for she is more beautiful than all her sisters the\nstars.  Her sisters come to her at night into her maiden chamber.\nEven the gods speak sometimes of Babbulkund, clad with her purple\ngarden.  Listen, for I perceive by your eyes that ye have not seen\nBabbulkund; there is a restlessness in them and an unappeased\nwonder.  Listen.  In the garden whereof I spoke there is a lake that\nhath no twin or fellow in the world; there is no companion for it\namong all the lakes.  The shores of it are of glass, and the bottom\nof it.  In it are great fish having golden and scarlet scales, and\nthey swim to and fro.  Here it is the wont of the eighty-second\nNehemoth (who rules in the city today) to come, after the dusk has\nfallen, and sit by the lake alone, and at this hour eight hundred\nslaves go down by steps through caverns into vaults beneath the\nlake.  Four hundred of them carrying purple lights march one behind\nthe other, from east to west, and four hundred carrying green lights\nmarch one behind the other, from west to east.  The two lines cross\nand re-cross each other in and out as the slaves go round and\nround, and the fearful fish flash up and down and to and fro.'\n\nBut upon that traveller speaking night descended, solemn and cold,\nand we wrapped ourselves in our blankets and lay down upon the sand\nin the sight of the astral sisters of Babbulkund.  And all that night\nthe desert said many things, softly and in a whisper, but I knew not\nwhat he said.  Only the sand knew and arose and was troubled and lay\ndown again, and the wind knew.  Then, as the hours of the night went\nby, these two discovered the foot-tracks wherewith we had disturbed\nthe holy desert, and they troubled over them and covered them up;\nand then the wind lay down and the sand rested.  Then the wind arose\nagain and the sand danced.  This they did many times.  And all the\nwhile the desert whispered what I shall not know.\n\nThen I slept awhile and awoke just before sunrise, very cold.\nSuddenly the sun leapt up and flamed upon our faces; we all threw\noff our blankets and stood up.  Then we took food, and afterwards\nstarted southwards, and in the heat of the day rested, and\nafterwards pushed on again.  And all the while the desert remained\nthe same, like a dream that will not cease to trouble a tired\nsleeper.\n\nAnd often travellers passed us in the desert, coming from the City\nof Marvel, and there was a light and a glory in their eyes from\nhaving seen Babbulkund.\n\nThat evening, at sunset, another traveller neared us, and we hailed\nhim, saying:\n\n'Wilt thou eat and drink with us, seeing that all men are brothers\nin the desert?'\n\nAnd he descended from his camel and sat by us and said:\n\n'When morning shines on the colossus Neb and Neb speaks, at once the\nmusicians of King Nehemoth in Babbulkund awake.\n\n'At first their fingers wander over their golden harps, or they\nstroke idly their violins.  Clearer and clearer the note of each\ninstrument ascends like larks arising from the dew, till suddenly\nthey all blend together and a new melody is born.  Thus, every\nmorning, the musicians of King Nehemoth make a new marvel in the\nCity of Marvel; for these are no common musicians, but masters of\nmelody, raided by conquest long since, and carried away in ships\nfrom the Isles of Song.  And, at the sound of the music, Nehemoth\nawakes in the eastern chamber of his palace, which is carved in the\nform of a great crescent, four miles long, on the northern side of\nthe city.  Full in the windows of its eastern chamber the sun rises,\nand full in the windows of its western chamber the sun sets.\n\n'When Nehemoth awakes he summons slaves who bring a palanquin with\nbells, which the King enters, having lightly robed.  Then the slaves\nrun and bear him to the onyx Chamber of the Bath, with the sound of\nsmall bells ringing as they run.  And when Nehemoth emerges thence,\nbathed and anointed, the slaves run on with their ringing palanquin\nand bear him to the Orient Chamber of Banquets, where the King takes\nthe first meal of the day.  Thence, through the great white corridor\nwhose windows all face sunwards, Nehemoth, in his palanquin, passes\non to the Audience Chamber of Embassies from the North, which is all\ndecked with Northern wares.\n\n'All about it are ornaments of amber from the North and carven\nchalices of the dark brown Northern crystal, and on its floors lie\nfurs from Baltic shores.\n\n'In adjoining chambers are stored the wonted food of the hardy\nNorthern men, and the strong wine of the North, pale but terrible.\nTherein the King receives barbarian princes from the frigid lands.\nThence the slaves bear him swiftly to the Audience Chamber of\nEmbassies from the East, where the walls are of turquoise, studded\nwith the rubies of Ceylon, where the gods are the gods of the East,\nwhere all the hangings have been devised in the gorgeous heart of Ind,\nand where all the carvings have been wrought with the cunning of the\nisles.  Here, if a caravan hath chanced to have come in from Ind or\nfrom Cathay, it is the King's wont to converse awhile with Moguls or\nMandarins, for from the East come the arts and knowledge of the world,\nand the converse of their people is polite.  Thus Nehemoth passes on\nthrough the other Audience Chambers and receives, perhaps, some\nSheikhs of the Arab folk who have crossed the great desert from the\nWest, or receives an embassy sent to do him homage from the shy\njungle people to the South.  And all the while the slaves with the\nringing palanquin run westwards, following the sun, and ever the sun\nshines straight into the chamber where Nehemoth sits, and all the\nwhile the music from one or other of his bands of musicians comes\ntinkling to his ears.  But when the middle of the day draws near, the\nslaves run to the cool groves that lie along the verandahs on the\nnorthern side of the palace, forsaking the sun, and as the heat\novercomes the genius of the musicians, one by one their hands fall\nfrom their instruments, till at last all melody ceases.  At this\nmoment Nehemoth falls asleep, and the slaves put the palanquin down\nand lie down beside it.  At this hour the city becomes quite still,\nand the palace of Nehemoth and the tombs of the Pharaohs of old face\nto the sunlight, all alike in silence.  Even the jewellers in the\nmarket-place, selling gems to princes, cease from their bargaining\nand cease to sing; for in Babbulkund the vendor of rubies sings the\nsong of the ruby, and the vendor of sapphires sings the song of the\nsapphire, and each stone hath its song, so that a man, by his song,\nproclaims and makes known his wares.\n\n'But all these sounds cease at the meridian hour, the jewellers in\nthe market-place lie down in what shadow they can find, and the\nprinces go back to the cool places in their palaces, and a great\nhush in the gleaming air hangs over Babbulkund.  But in the cool of\nthe late afternoon, one of the King's musicians will awake from\ndreaming of his home and will pass his fingers, perhaps, over the\nstrings of his harp and, with the music, some memory may arise of\nthe wind in the glens of the mountains that stand in the Isles of\nSong.  Then the musician will wrench great cries out of the soul of\nhis harp for the sake of the old memory, and his fellows will awake\nand all make a song of home, woven of sayings told in the harbour\nwhen the ships came in, and of tales in the cottages about the\npeople of old time.  One by one the other bands of musicians will\ntake up the song, and Babbulkund, City of Marvel, will throb with\nthis marvel anew.  Just now Nehemoth awakes, the slaves leap to their\nfeet and bear the palanquin to the outer side of the great crescent\npalace between the south and the west, to behold the sun again.  The\npalanquin, with its ringing bells, goes round once more; the voices\nof the jewellers sing again, in the market-place, the song of the\nemerald, the song of the sapphire; men talk on the housetops,\nbeggars wail in the streets, the musicians bend to their work, all\nthe sounds blend together into one murmur, the voice of Babbulkund\nspeaking at evening.  Lower and lower sinks the sun, till Nehemoth,\nfollowing it, comes with his panting slaves to the great purple\ngarden of which surely thine own country has its songs, from\nwherever thou art come.\n\n'There he alights from his palanquin and goes up to a throne of\nivory set in the garden's midst, facing full westwards, and sits\nthere alone, long regarding the sunlight until it is quite gone.  At\nthis hour trouble comes into the face of Nehemoth.  Men have heard\nhim muttering at the time of sunset: \"Even I too, even I too.\" Thus\ndo King Nehemoth and the sun make their glorious ambits about\nBabbulkund.\n\n'A little later, when the stars come out to envy the beauty of the\nCity of Marvel, the King walks to another part of the garden and\nsits in an alcove of opal all alone by the marge of the sacred lake.\nThis is the lake whose shores and floors are of glass, which is lit\nfrom beneath by slaves with purple lights and with green lights\nintermingling, and is one of the seven wonders of Babbulkund.  Three\nof the wonders are in the city's midst and four are at her gates.\nThere is the lake, of which I tell thee, and the purple garden of\nwhich I have told thee and which is a wonder even to the stars, and\nthere is Ong Zwarba, of which I shall tell thee also.  And the\nwonders at the gates are these.  At the eastern gate Neb.  And at the\nnorthern gate the wonder of the river and the arches, for the River\nof Myth, which becomes one with the Waters of Fable in the desert\noutside the city, floats under a gate of pure gold, rejoicing, and\nunder many arches fantastically carven that are one with either\nbank.  The marvel at the western gate is the marvel of Annolith and\nthe dog Voth.  Annolith sits outside the western gate facing towards\nthe city.  He is higher than any of the towers or palaces, for his\nhead was carved from the summit of the old hill; he hath two eyes of\nsapphire wherewith he regards Babbulkund, and the wonder of the eyes\nis that they are today in the same sockets wherein they glowed when\nfirst the world began, only the marble that covered them has been\ncarven away and the light of day let in and the sight of the envious\nstars.  Larger than a lion is the dog Voth beside him; every hair is\ncarven upon the back of Voth, his war hackles are erected and his\nteeth are bared.  All the Nehemoths have worshipped the god Annolith,\nbut all their people pray to the dog Voth, for the law of the land\nis that none but a Nehemoth may worship the god Annolith.  The marvel\nat the southern gate is the marvel of the jungle, for he comes with\nall his wild untravelled sea of darkness and trees and tigers and\nsunward-aspiring orchids right through a marble gate in the city\nwall and enters the city, and there widens and holds a space in its\nmidst of many miles across.  Moreover, he is older than the City of\nMarvel, for he dwelt long since in one of the valleys of the\nmountain which Nehemoth, first of Pharaohs, carved into Babbulkund.\n\n'Now the opal alcove in which the King sits at evening by the lake\nstands at the edge of the jungle, and the climbing orchids of the\njungle have long since crept from their homes through clefts of the\nopal alcove, lured by the lights of the lake, and now bloom there\nexultingly.  Near to this alcove are the hareems of Nehemoth.\n\n'The King hath four hareems--one for the stalwart women from the\nmountains to the north, one for the dark and furtive jungle women,\none for the desert women that have wandering souls and pine in\nBabbulkund, and one for the princesses of his own kith, whose brown\ncheeks blush with the blood of ancient Pharaohs and who exult with\nBabbulkund in her surpassing beauty, and who know nought of the\ndesert or the jungle or the bleak hills to the north.  Quite\nunadorned and clad in simple garments go all the kith of Nehemoth,\nfor they know well that he grows weary of pomp.  Unadorned all save\none, the Princess Linderith, who weareth Ong Zwarba and the three\nlesser gems of the sea.  Such a stone is Ong Zwarba that there are\nnone like it even in the turban of Nehemoth nor in all the\nsanctuaries of the sea.  The same god that made Linderith made long\nago Ong Zwarba; she and Ong Zwarba shine together with one light,\nand beside this marvellous stone gleam the three lesser ones of the\nsea.\n\n'Now when the King sitteth in his opal alcove by the sacred lake\nwith the orchids blooming around him all sounds are become still.\nThe sound of the tramping of the weary slaves as they go round and\nround never comes to the surface.  Long since the musicians sleep,\nand their hands have fallen dumb upon their instruments, and the\nvoices in the city have died away.  Perhaps a sigh of one of the\ndesert women has become half a song, or on a hot night in summer one\nof the women of the hills sings softly a song of snow; all night\nlong in the midst of the purple garden sings one nightingale; all else\nis still; the stars that look on Babbulkund arise and set, the\ncold unhappy moon drifts lonely through them, the night wears on; at\nlast the dark figure of Nehemoth, eighty-second of his line, rises\nand moves stealthily away.'\n\nThe traveller ceased to speak.  For a long time the clear stars,\nsisters of Babbulkund, had shone upon him speaking, the desert\nwind had arisen and whispered to the sand, and the sand had long\ngone secretly to and fro; none of us had moved, none of us had\nfallen asleep, not so much from wonder at his tale as from the\nthought that we ourselves in two days' time should see that wondrous\ncity.  Then we wrapped our blankets around us and lay down with our\nfeet towards the embers of our fire and instantly were asleep, and in\nour dreams we multiplied the fame of the City of Marvel.\n\nThe sun arose and flamed upon our faces, and all the desert glinted\nwith its light.  Then we stood up and prepared the morning meal, and,\nwhen we had eaten, the traveller departed.  And we commended his soul\nto the god of the land whereto he went, of the land of his home to\nthe northward, and he commended our souls to the God of the people\nof the land wherefrom we had come.  Then a traveller overtook us\ngoing on foot; he wore a brown cloak that was all in rags and he\nseemed to have been walking all night, and he walked hurriedly but\nappeared weary, so we offered him food and drink, of which he\npartook thankfully.  When we asked him where he was going, he\nanswered 'Babbulkund.' Then we offered him a camel upon which to\nride, for we said, 'We also go to Babbulkund.' But he answered\nstrangely:\n\n'Nay, pass on before me, for it is a sore thing never to have seen\nBabbulkund, having lived while yet she stood.  Pass on before me and\nbehold her, and then flee away at once, returning northwards.'\n\nThen, though we understood him not, we left him, for he was\ninsistent, and passed on our journey southwards through the desert,\nand we came before the middle of the day to an oasis of palm trees\nstanding by a well and there we gave water to the haughty camels and\nreplenished our water-bottles and soothed our eyes with the sight of\ngreen things and tarried for many hours in the shade.  Some of the\nmen slept, but of those that remained awake each man sang softly the\nsongs of his own country, telling of Babbulkund.  When the afternoon\nwas far spent we travelled a little way southwards, and went on\nthrough the cool evening until the sun fell low and we encamped, and\nas we sat in our encampment the man in rags overtook us, having\ntravelled all the day, and we gave him food and drink again, and in\nthe twilight he spoke, saying:\n\n'I am the servant of the Lord the God of my people, and I go to do\nhis work on Babbulkund.  She is the most beautiful city in the world;\nthere hath been none like her, even the stars of God go envious of\nher beauty.  She is all white, yet with streaks of pink that pass\nthrough her streets and houses like flames in the white mind of a\nsculptor, like desire in Paradise.  She hath been carved of old out\nof a holy hill, no slaves wrought the City of Marvel, but artists\ntoiling at the work they loved.  They took no pattern from the houses\nof men, but each man wrought what his inner eye had seen and carved\nin marble the visions of his dream.  All over the roof of one of the\npalace chambers winged lions flit like bats, the size of every one\nis the size of the lions of God, and the wings are larger than any\nwing created; they are one above the other more than a man can\nnumber, they are all carven out of one block of marble, the chamber\nitself is hollowed from it, and it is borne aloft upon the carven\nbranches of a grove of clustered tree-ferns wrought by the hand of\nsome jungle mason that loved the tall fern well.  Over the River of\nMyth, which is one with the Waters of Fable, go bridges, fashioned\nlike the wisteria tree and like the drooping laburnum, and a hundred\nothers of wonderful devices, the desire of the souls of masons a\nlong while dead.  Oh! very beautiful is white Babbulkund, very\nbeautiful she is, but proud; and the Lord the God of my people hath\nseen her in her pride, and looking towards her hath seen the prayers\nof Nehemoth going up to the abomination Annolith and all the people\nfollowing after Voth.  She is very beautiful, Babbulkund; alas that\nI may not bless her.  I could live always on one of her inner\nterraces looking on the mysterious jungle in her midst and the\nheavenward faces of the orchids that, clambering from the darkness,\nbehold the sun.  I could love Babbulkund with a great love, yet am I\nthe servant of the Lord the God of my people, and the King hath\nsinned unto the abomination Annolith, and the people lust\nexceedingly for Voth.  Alas for thee, Babbulkund, alas that I may not\neven now turn back, for tomorrow I must prophesy against thee and\ncry out against thee, Babbulkund.  But ye travellers that have\nentreated me hospitably, rise and pass on with your camels, for I\ncan tarry no longer, and I go to do the work on Babbulkund of the\nLord the God of my people.  Go now and see the beauty of Babbulkund\nbefore I cry out against her, and then flee swiftly northwards.'\n\nA smouldering fragment fell in upon our camp fire and sent a strange\nlight into the eyes of the man in rags.  He rose at once, and his\ntattered cloak swirled up with him like a great wing; he said no\nmore, but turned round from us instantly southwards, and strode away\ninto the darkness towards Babbulkund.  Then a hush fell upon our\nencampment, and the smell of the tobacco of those lands arose.  When\nthe last flame died down in our camp fire I fell asleep, but my rest\nwas troubled by shifting dreams of doom.\n\nMorning came, and our guides told us that we should come to the city\nere nightfall.  Again we passed southwards through the changeless\ndesert; sometimes we met travellers coming from Babbulkund, with the\nbeauty of its marvels still fresh in their eyes.\n\nWhen we encamped near the middle of the day we saw a great number of\npeople on foot coming towards us running, from the southwards.  These\nwe hailed when they were come near, saying, 'What of Babbulkund?'\n\nThey answered: 'We are not of the race of the people of\nBabbulkund, but were captured in youth and taken away from the hills\nthat are to the northward.  Now we have all seen in visions of the\nstillness the Lord the God of our people calling to us from His\nhills, and therefore we all flee northwards.  But in Babbulkund King\nNehemoth hath been troubled in the nights by unkingly dreams of\ndoom, and none may interpret what the dreams portend.  Now this is\nthe dream that King Nehemoth dreamed on the first night of his\ndreaming.  He saw move through the stillness a bird all black, and\nbeneath the beatings of his wings Babbulkund gloomed and darkened;\nand after him flew a bird all white, beneath the beatings of whose\nwings Babbulkund gleamed and shone; and there flew by four more\nbirds alternately black and white.  And, as the black ones passed\nBabbulkund darkened, and when the white ones appeared her streets\nand houses shone.  But after the sixth bird there came no more, and\nBabbulkund vanished from her place, and there was only the empty\ndesert where she had stood, and the rivers Oonrana and Pleg\u00e1thanees\nmourning alone.  Next morning all the prophets of the King gathered\nbefore their abominations and questioned them of the dream, and the\nabominations spake not.  But when the second night stepped down from\nthe halls of God, dowered with many stars, King Nehemoth dreamed\nagain; and in this dream King Nehemoth saw four birds only, black\nand white alternately as before.  And Babbulkund darkened again as\nthe black ones passed, and shone when the white came by; only after\nthe four birds came no more, and Babbulkund vanished from her place,\nleaving only the forgetful desert and the mourning rivers.\n\n'Still the abominations spake not, and none could interpret the\ndream.  And when the third night came forth from the divine halls\nof her home dowered like her sisters, again King Nehemoth dreamed.\nAnd he saw a bird all black go by again, beneath whom Babbulkund\ndarkened, and then a white bird and Babbulkund shone; and after them\ncame no more, and Babbulkund passed away.  And the golden day\nappeared, dispelling dreams, and still the abominations were silent,\nand the King's prophets answered not to portend the omen of the\ndream.  One prophet only spake before the King, saying: \"The sable\nbirds, O King, are the nights, and the white birds are the\ndays.  . .\" This thing the King had feared, and he arose and smote the\nprophet with his sword, whose soul went crying away and had to do no\nmore with nights and days.\n\n'It was last night that the King dreamed his third dream, and this\nmorning we fled away from Babbulkund.  A great heat lies over it, and\nthe orchids of the jungle droop their heads.  All night long the\nwomen in the hareem of the North have wailed horribly for their\nhills.  A fear hath fallen upon the city, and a boding.  Twice hath\nNehemoth gone to worship Annolith, and all the people have\nprostrated themselves before Voth.  Thrice the horologers have looked\ninto the great crystal globe wherein are foretold all happenings to\nbe, and thrice the globe was blank.  Yea, though they went a fourth\ntime yet was no vision revealed; and the people's voice is hushed in\nBabbulkund.'\n\nSoon the travellers arose and pushed on northwards again, leaving us\nwondering.  Through the heat of the day we rested as well as we\nmight, but the air was motionless and sultry and the camels ill at\nease.  The Arabs said that it boded a desert storm, and that a great\nwind would arise full of sand.  So we arose in the afternoon, and\ntravelled swiftly, hoping to come to shelter before the storm.  And\nthe air burned in the stillness between the baked desert and the\nglaring sky.\n\nSuddenly a wind arose out of the South, blowing from Babbulkund, and\nthe sand lifted and went by in great shapes, all whispering.  And the\nwind blew violently, and wailed as it blew, and hundreds of sandy\nshapes went towering by, and there were little cries among them and\nthe sounds of a passing away.  Soon the wind sank quite suddenly, and\nits cries died, and the panic ceased among the driven sands.  And\nwhen the storm departed the air was cool, and the terrible\nsultriness and the boding were passed away, and the camels had ease\namong them.  And the Arabs said that the storm which was to be had\nbeen, as was willed of old by God.\n\nThe sun set and the gloaming came, and we neared the junction of\nOonrana and Pleg\u00e1thanees, but in the darkness discerned not\nBabbulkund.  We pushed on hurriedly to reach the city ere nightfall,\nand came to the junction of the River of Myth where he meets with\nthe Waters of Fable, and still saw not Babbulkund.  All round us lay\nthe sand and rocks of the unchanging desert, save to the southwards\nwhere the jungle stood with its orchids facing skywards.  Then we\nperceived that we had arrived too late, and that her doom had come\nto Babbulkund; and by the river in the empty desert on the sand the\nman in rags was seated, with his face hidden in his hands, weeping\nbitterly.\n\n    *   *   *   *   *   *   *\n\nThus passed away in the hour of her iniquities before Annolith, in\nthe two thousand and thirty-second year of her being, in the six\nthousand and fiftieth year of the building of the World, Babbulkund,\nCity of Marvel, sometime called by those that hated her City of the\nDog, but hourly mourned in Araby and Ind and wide through jungle and\ndesert; leaving no memorial in stone to show that she had been, but\nremembered with an abiding love, in spite of the anger of God, by\nall that knew her beauty, whereof still they sing.\n\n\n\n\nThe Kith of the Elf Folk\n\nChapter I\n\nThe north wind was blowing, and red and golden the last days of\nAutumn were streaming hence.  Solemn and cold over the marshes arose\nthe evening.\n\nIt became very still.\n\nThen the last pigeon went home to the trees on the dry land in the\ndistance, whose shapes already had taken upon themselves a mystery\nin the haze.\n\nThen all was still again.\n\nAs the light faded and the haze deepened, mystery crept nearer from\nevery side.\n\nThen the green plover came in crying, and all alighted.\n\nAnd again it became still, save when one of the plover arose and flew\na little way uttering the cry of the waste.  And hushed and silent\nbecame the earth, expecting the first star.  Then the duck came in,\nand the widgeon, company by company: and all the light of day faded\nout of the sky saving one red band of light.  Across the light\nappeared, black and huge, the wings of a flock of geese beating up\nwind to the marshes.  These, too, went down among the rushes.\n\nThen the stars appeared and shone in the stillness, and there was\nsilence in the great spaces of the night.\n\nSuddenly the bells of the cathedral in the marshes broke out,\ncalling to evensong.\n\nEight centuries ago on the edge of the marsh men had built the huge\ncathedral, or it may have been seven centuries ago, or perhaps\nnine--it was all one to the Wild Things.\n\nSo evensong was held, and candles lighted, and the lights through\nthe windows shone red and green in the water, and the sound of the\norgan went roaring over the marshes.  But from the deep and perilous\nplaces, edged with bright mosses, the Wild Things came leaping up to\ndance on the reflection of the stars, and over their heads as they\ndanced the marsh-lights rose and fell.\n\nThe Wild Things are somewhat human in appearance, only all brown\nof skin and barely two feet high.  Their ears are pointed like the\nsquirrel's, only far larger, and they leap to prodigious heights.\nThey live all day under deep pools in the loneliest marshes, but at\nnight they come up and dance.  Each Wild Thing has over its head a\nmarsh-light, which moves as the Wild Thing moves; they have no\nsouls, and cannot die, and are of the kith of the Elf-folk.\n\nAll night they dance over the marshes, treading upon the reflection\nof the stars (for the bare surface of the water will not hold them\nby itself); but when the stars begin to pale, they sink down one by\none into the pools of their home.  Or if they tarry longer, sitting\nupon the rushes, their bodies fade from view as the marsh-fires pale\nin the light, and by daylight none may see the Wild Things of the\nkith of the Elf-folk.  Neither may any see them even at night unless\nthey were born, as I was, in the hour of dusk, just at the moment\nwhen the first star appears.\n\nNow, on the night that I tell of, a little Wild Thing had gone\ndrifting over the waste, till it came right up to the walls of the\ncathedral and danced upon the images of the coloured saints as they\nlay in the water among the reflection of the stars.  And as it leaped\nin its fantastic dance, it saw through the painted windows to where\nthe people prayed, and heard the organ roaring over the marshes.  The\nsound of the organ roared over the marshes, but the song and prayers\nof the people streamed up from the cathedral's highest tower like\nthin gold chains, and reached to Paradise, and up and down them went\nthe angels from Paradise to the people, and from the people to\nParadise again.\n\nThen something akin to discontent troubled the Wild Thing for the\nfirst time since the making of the marshes; and the soft grey ooze\nand the chill of the deep water seemed to be not enough, nor the\nfirst arrival from northwards of the tumultuous geese, nor the wild\nrejoicing of the wings of the wildfowl when every feather sings, nor\nthe wonder of the calm ice that comes when the snipe depart and\nbeards the rushes with frost and clothes the hushed waste with a\nmysterious haze where the sun goes red and low, nor even the dance\nof the Wild Things in the marvellous night; and the little Wild\nThing longed to have a soul, and to go and worship God.\n\nAnd when evensong was over and the lights were out, it went back\ncrying to its kith.\n\nBut on the next night, as soon as the images of the stars appeared\nin the water, it went leaping away from star to star to the farthest\nedge of the marshlands, where a great wood grew where dwelt the\nOldest of the Wild Things.\n\nAnd it found the Oldest of Wild Things sitting under a tree,\nsheltering itself from the moon.\n\nAnd the little Wild Thing said: 'I want to have a soul to worship\nGod, and to know the meaning of music, and to see the inner beauty\nof the marshlands and to imagine Paradise.'\n\nAnd the Oldest of the Wild Things said to it: 'What have we to do\nwith God? We are only Wild Things, and of the kith of the Elf-folk.'\n\nBut it only answered, 'I want to have a soul.'\n\nThen the Oldest of the Wild Things said: 'I have no soul to give\nyou; but if you got a soul, one day you would have to die, and if\nyou knew the meaning of music you would learn the meaning of sorrow,\nand it is better to be a Wild Thing and not to die.'\n\nSo it went weeping away.\n\nBut they that were kin to the Elf-folk were sorry for the little\nWild Thing; and though the Wild Things cannot sorrow long, having no\nsouls to sorrow with, yet they felt for awhile a soreness where\ntheir souls should be, when they saw the grief of their comrade.\n\nSo the kith of the Elf-folk went abroad by night to make a soul for\nthe little Wild Thing.  And they went over the marshes till they came\nto the high fields among the flowers and grasses.  And there they\ngathered a large piece of gossamer that the spider had laid by\ntwilight; and the dew was on it.\n\nInto this dew had shone all the lights of the long banks of the\nribbed sky, as all the colours changed in the restful spaces of\nevening.  And over it the marvellous night had gleamed with all its\nstars.\n\nThen the Wild Things went with their dew-bespangled gossamer down to\nthe edge of their home.  And there they gathered a piece of the grey\nmist that lies by night over the marshlands.  And into it they put\nthe melody of the waste that is borne up and down the marshes in the\nevening on the wings of the golden plover.  And they put into it, too,\nthe mournful song that the reeds are compelled to sing before the\npresence of the arrogant North Wind.  Then each of the Wild Things\ngave some treasured memory of the old marshes, 'For we can spare\nit,' they said.  And to all this they added a few images of the stars\nthat they gathered out of the water.  Still the soul that the kith of\nthe Elf-folk were making had no life.\n\nThen they put into it the low voices of two lovers that went walking\nin the night, wandering late alone.  And after that they waited for\nthe dawn.  And the queenly dawn appeared, and the marsh-lights of the\nWild Things paled in the glare, and their bodies faded from view;\nand still they waited by the marsh's edge.  And to them waiting came\nover field and marsh, from the ground and out of the sky, the myriad\nsong of the birds.\n\nThis, too, the Wild Things put into the piece of haze that they had\ngathered in the marshlands, and wrapped it all up in their\ndew-bespangled gossamer.  Then the soul lived.\n\nAnd there it lay in\nthe hands of the Wild Things no larger than a hedgehog; and wonderful\nlights were in it, green and blue; and they changed ceaselessly,\ngoing round and round, and in the grey midst of it was a purple\nflare.\n\nAnd the next night they came to the little Wild Thing and\nshowed her the gleaming soul.  And they said to her: 'If you must\nhave a soul and go and worship God, and become a mortal and die,\nplace this to your left breast a little above the heart, and it will\nenter and you will become a human.  But if you take it you can never\nbe rid of it to become immortal again unless you pluck it out and\ngive it to another; and we will not take it, and most of the humans\nhave a soul already.  And if you cannot find a human without a soul\nyou will one day die, and your soul cannot go to Paradise, because\nit was only made in the marshes.'\n\nFar away the little Wild Thing saw\nthe cathedral windows alight for evensong, and the song of the\npeople mounting up to Paradise, and all the angels going up and\ndown.  So it bid farewell with tears and thanks to the Wild Things of\nthe kith of Elf-folk, and went leaping away towards the green dry\nland, holding the soul in its hands.\n\nAnd the Wild Things were sorry that it had gone, but could not be\nsorry long, because they had no souls.\n\nAt the marsh's edge the little Wild Thing gazed for some moments\nover the water to where the marsh-fires were leaping up and down,\nand then pressed the soul against its left breast a little above the\nheart.\n\nInstantly it became a young and beautiful woman, who was cold and\nfrightened.  She clad herself somehow with bundles of reeds, and went\ntowards the lights of a house that stood close by.  And she pushed\nopen the door and entered, and found a farmer and a farmer's wife\nsitting over their supper.\n\nAnd the farmer's wife took the little Wild Thing with the soul of\nthe marshes up to her room, and clothed her and braided her hair,\nand brought her down again, and gave her the first food that she had\never eaten.  Then the farmer's wife asked many questions.\n\n'Where have you come from?' she said.\n\n'Over the marshes.'\n\n'From what direction?' said the farmer's wife.\n\n'South,' said the little Wild Thing with the new soul.\n\n'But none can come over the marshes from the south,' said the\nfarmer's wife.\n\n'No, they can't do that,' said the farmer.\n\n'I lived in the marshes.'\n\n'Who are you?' asked the farmer's wife.\n\n'I am a Wild Thing, and have found a soul in the marshes, and we are\nkin to the Elf-folk.'\n\nTalking it over afterwards, the farmer and his wife agreed that she\nmust be a gipsy who had been lost, and that she was queer with\nhunger and exposure.\n\nSo that night the little Wild Thing slept in the farmer's house, but\nher new soul stayed awake the whole night long dreaming of the\nbeauty of the marshes.\n\nAs soon as dawn came over the waste and shone on the farmer's house,\nshe looked from the window towards the glittering waters, and saw\nthe inner beauty of the marsh.  For the Wild Things only love the\nmarsh and know its haunts, but now she perceived the mystery of its\ndistances and the glamour of its perilous pools, with their fair and\ndeadly mosses, and felt the marvel of the North Wind who comes\ndominant out of unknown icy lands, and the wonder of that ebb and\nflow of life when the wildfowl whirl in at evening to the marshlands\nand at dawn pass out to sea.  And she knew that over her head above\nthe farmer's house stretched wide Paradise, where perhaps God was\nnow imagining a sunrise while angels played low on lutes, and the\nsun came rising up on the world below to gladden fields and marsh.\n\nAnd all that heaven thought, the marsh thought too; for the blue of\nthe marsh was as the blue of heaven, and the great cloud shapes in\nheaven became the shapes in the marsh, and through each ran\nmomentary rivers of purple, errant between banks of gold.  And the\nstalwart army of reeds appeared out of the gloom with all their\npennons waving as far as the eye could see.  And from another window\nshe saw the vast cathedral gathering its ponderous strength\ntogether, and lifting it up in towers out of the marshlands.\n\nShe said, 'I will never, never leave the marsh.'\n\nAn hour later she dressed with great difficulty and went down to eat\nthe second meal of her life.  The farmer and his wife were kindly\nfolk, and taught her how to eat.\n\n'I suppose the gipsies don't have knives and forks,' one said to the\nother afterwards.\n\nAfter breakfast the farmer went and saw the Dean, who lived near his\ncathedral, and presently returned and brought back to the Dean's\nhouse the little Wild Thing with the new soul.\n\n'This is the lady,' said the farmer.  'This is Dean Murnith.' Then he\nwent away.\n\n'Ah,' said the Dean, 'I understand you were lost the other night in\nthe marshes.  It was a terrible night to be lost in the marshes.'\n\n'I love the marshes,' said the little Wild Thing with the new soul.\n\n'Indeed!  How old are you?' said the Dean.\n\n'I don't know,' she answered.\n\n'You must know about how old you are,' he said.\n\n'Oh, about ninety,' she said, 'or more.'\n\n'Ninety years!' exclaimed the Dean.\n\n'No, ninety centuries,' she said; 'I am as old as the marshes.'\n\nThen she told her story--how she had longed to be a human and go and\nworship God, and have a soul and see the beauty of the world, and\nhow all the Wild Things had made her a soul of gossamer and mist and\nmusic and strange memories.\n\n'But if this is true,' said Dean Murnith, 'this is very wrong.  God\ncannot have intended you to have a soul.\n\n'What is your name?'\n\n'I have no name,' she answered.\n\n'We must find a Christian name and a surname for you.  What would you\nlike to be called?'\n\n'Song of the Rushes,' she said.\n\n'That won't do at all,' said the Dean.\n\n'Then I would like to be called Terrible North Wind, or Star in the\nWaters,' she said.\n\n'No, no, no,' said Dean Murnith; 'that is quite impossible.  We could\ncall you Miss Rush if you like.  How would Mary Rush do? Perhaps you\nhad better have another name--say Mary Jane Rush.'\n\nSo the little Wild Thing with the soul of the marshes took the names\nthat were offered her, and became Mary Jane Rush.\n\n'And we must find something for you to do,' said Dean Murnith.\n'Meanwhile we can give you a room here.'\n\n'I don't want to do anything,' replied Mary Jane; 'I want to worship\nGod in the cathedral and live beside the marshes.'\n\nThen Mrs. Murnith came in, and for the rest of that day Mary Jane\nstayed at the house of the Dean.\n\nAnd there with her new soul she\nperceived the beauty of the world; for it came grey and level out\nof misty distances, and widened into grassy fields and ploughlands\nright up to the edge of an old gabled town; and solitary in the\nfields far off an ancient windmill stood, and his honest hand-made\nsails went round and round in the free East Anglian winds.  Close by,\nthe gabled houses leaned out over the streets, planted fair upon\nsturdy timbers that grew in the olden time, all glorying among\nthemselves upon their beauty.  And out of them, buttress by buttress,\ngrowing and going upwards, aspiring tower by tower, rose the\ncathedral.\n\nAnd she saw the people moving in the streets all\nleisurely and slow, and unseen among them, whispering to each other,\nunheard by living men and concerned only with bygone things, drifted\nthe ghosts of very long ago.  And wherever the streets ran eastwards,\nwherever were gaps in the houses, always there broke into view the\nsight of the great marshes, like to some bar of music weird and\nstrange that haunts a melody, arising again and again, played on the\nviolin by one musician only, who plays no other bar, and he is swart\nand lank about the hair and bearded about the lips, and his\nmoustache droops long and low, and no one knows the land from which\nhe comes.\n\nAll these were good things for a new soul to see.\n\nThen the sun set over green fields and ploughland and the night came\nup.  One by one the merry lights of cheery lamp-lit windows took\ntheir stations in the solemn night.\n\nThen the bells rang, far up in a cathedral tower,\nand their melody fell on the roofs of the old houses and poured over\ntheir eaves until the streets were full, and then flooded away over\ngreen fields and plough, till it came to the sturdy mill and brought\nthe miller trudging to evensong, and far away eastwards and seawards\nthe sound rang out over the remoter marshes.  And it was all as\nyesterday to the old ghosts in the streets.\n\nThen the Dean's wife took Mary Jane to evening service, and she saw\nthree hundred candles filling all the aisle with light.  But sturdy\npillars stood there in unlit vastnesses; great colonnades going away\ninto the gloom, where evening and morning, year in year out, they\ndid their work in the dark, holding the cathedral roof aloft.  And it\nwas stiller than the marshes are still when the ice has come and the\nwind that brought it has fallen.\n\nSuddenly into this stillness rushed the sound of the organ, roaring,\nand presently the people prayed and sang.\n\nNo longer could Mary Jane\nsee their prayers ascending like thin gold chains, for that was but\nan elfin fancy, but she imagined clear in her new soul the seraphs\npassing in the ways of Paradise, and the angels changing guard to\nwatch the World by night.\n\nWhen the Dean had finished service, a young curate, Mr. Millings,\nwent up into the pulpit.\n\nHe spoke of Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus: and Mary Jane was\nglad that there were rivers having such names, and heard with wonder\nof Nineveh, that great city, and many things strange and new.\n\nAnd the light of the candles shone on the curate's fair hair, and\nhis voice went ringing down the aisle, and Mary Jane rejoiced that\nhe was there.\n\nBut when his voice stopped she felt a sudden\nloneliness, such as she had not felt since the making of the\nmarshes; for the Wild Things never are lonely and never unhappy, but\ndance all night on the reflection of the stars, and having no\nsouls, desire nothing more.\n\nAfter the collection was made, before anyone moved to go, Mary Jane\nwalked up the aisle to Mr. Millings.\n\n'I love you,' she said.\n\n\nChapter II\n\nNobody sympathised with Mary Jane.\n\n'So unfortunate for Mr. Millings,' every one said; 'such a promising\nyoung man.'\n\nMary Jane was sent away to a great manufacturing city of the\nMidlands, where work had been found for her in a cloth factory.  And\nthere was nothing in that town that was good for a soul to see.  For\nit did not know that beauty was to be desired; so it made many\nthings by machinery, and became hurried in all its ways, and boasted\nits superiority over other cities and became richer and richer, and\nthere was none to pity it.\n\nIn this city Mary Jane had had lodgings found for her near the\nfactory.\n\nAt six o'clock on those November mornings, about the time that, far\naway from the city, the wildfowl rose up out of the calm marshes and\npassed to the troubled spaces of the sea, at six o'clock the factory\nuttered a prolonged howl and gathered the workers together, and\nthere they worked, saving two hours for food, the whole of the\ndaylit hours and into the dark till the bells tolled six again.\n\nThere Mary Jane worked with other girls in a long dreary room, where\ngiants sat pounding wool into a long thread-like strip with iron,\nrasping hands.  And all day long they roared as they sat at their\nsoulless work.  But the work of Mary Jane was not with these, only\ntheir roar was ever in her ears as their clattering iron limbs went\nto and fro.\n\nHer work was to tend a creature smaller, but infinitely more\ncunning.\n\nIt took the strip of wool that the giants had threshed, and whirled\nit round and round until it had twisted it into hard thin thread.\nThen it would make a clutch with fingers of steel at the thread that\nit had gathered, and waddle away about five yards and come back with\nmore.\n\nIt had mastered all the subtlety of skilled workers, and had\ngradually displaced them; one thing only it could not do, it was\nunable to pick up the ends if a piece of the thread broke, in order\nto tie them together again.  For this a human soul was required, and\nit was Mary Jane's business to pick up broken ends; and the moment\nshe placed them together the busy soulless creature tied them for\nitself.\n\nAll here was ugly; even the green wool as it whirled round and round\nwas neither the green of the grass nor yet the green of the rushes,\nbut a sorry muddy green that befitted a sullen city under a murky\nsky.\n\nWhen she looked out over the roofs of the town, there too was\nugliness; and well the houses knew it, for with hideous stucco\nthey aped in grotesque mimicry the pillars and temples of old\nGreece, pretending to one another to be that which they were not.\nAnd emerging from these houses and going in, and seeing the pretence\nof paint and stucco year after year until it all peeled away, the\nsouls of the poor owners of those houses sought to be other souls\nuntil they grew weary of it.\n\nAt evening Mary Jane went back to her lodgings.  Only then, after the\ndark had fallen, could the soul of Mary Jane perceive any beauty in\nthat city, when the lamps were lit and here and there a star shone\nthrough the smoke.  Then she would have gone abroad and beheld the\nnight, but this the old woman to whom she was confided would not let\nher do.  And the days multiplied themselves by seven and became\nweeks, and the weeks passed by, and all days were the same.  And all\nthe while the soul of Mary Jane was crying for beautiful things, and\nfound not one, saving on Sundays, when she went to church, and left\nit to find the city greyer than before.\n\nOne day she decided that it was better to be a wild thing in the\nlovely marshes, than to have a soul that cried for beautiful things\nand found not one.  From that day she determined to be rid of her\nsoul, so she told her story to one of the factory girls, and said to\nher:\n\n'The other girls are poorly clad and they do soulless work; surely\nsome of them have no souls and would take mine.'\n\nBut the factory girl said to her: 'All the poor have souls.  It is\nall they have.'\n\nThen Mary Jane watched the rich whenever she saw them, and vainly\nsought for some one without a soul.\n\nOne day at the hour when the\nmachines rested and the human beings that tended them rested too,\nthe wind being at that time from the direction of the marshlands,\nthe soul of Mary Jane lamented bitterly.  Then, as she stood outside\nthe factory gates, the soul irresistibly compelled her to sing, and\na wild song came from her lips, hymning the marshlands.  And into her\nsong came crying her yearning for home, and for the sound of the\nshout of the North Wind, masterful and proud, with his lovely lady\nthe Snow; and she sang of tales that the rushes murmured to one\nanother, tales that the teal knew and the watchful heron.  And over\nthe crowded streets her song went crying away, the song of waste\nplaces and of wild free lands, full of wonder and magic, for she had\nin her elf-made soul the song of the birds and the roar of the organ\nin the marshes.\n\nAt this moment Signor Thompsoni, the well-known English tenor,\nhappened to go by with a friend.  They stopped and listened; everyone\nstopped and listened.\n\n'There has been nothing like this in Europe in my time,' said Signor\nThompsoni.\n\nSo a change came into the life of Mary Jane.\n\nPeople were written to,\nand finally it was arranged that she should take a leading part in\nthe Covent Garden Opera in a few weeks.\n\nSo she went to London to learn.\n\nLondon and singing lessons were\nbetter than the City of the Midlands and those terrible machines.\nYet still Mary Jane was not free to go and live as she liked by the\nedge of the marshlands, and she was still determined to be rid of\nher soul, but could find no one that had not a soul of their own.\n\nOne day she was told that the English people would not listen to her\nas Miss Rush, and was asked what more suitable name she would like\nto be called by.\n\n'I would like to be called Terrible North Wind,' said Mary Jane, 'or\nSong of the Rushes.'\n\nWhen she was told that this was impossible and Signorina Maria\nRussiano was suggested, she acquiesced at once, as she had\nacquiesced when they took her away from her curate; she\nknew nothing of the ways of humans.\n\nAt last the day of the Opera\ncame round, and it was a cold day of the winter.\n\nAnd Signorina Russiano appeared on the stage before a crowded house.\n\nAnd Signorina Russiano sang.\n\nAnd into the song went all the longing of her soul, the soul that\ncould not go to Paradise, but could only worship God and know the\nmeaning of music, and the longing pervaded that Italian song as the\ninfinite mystery of the hills is borne along the sound of distant\nsheep-bells.  Then in the souls that were in that crowded house arose\nlittle memories of a great while since that were quite quite dead,\nand lived awhile again during that marvellous song.\n\nAnd a strange chill went into the blood of all that listened, as\nthough they stood on the border of bleak marshes and the North Wind\nblew.\n\nAnd some it moved to sorrow and some to regret, and some to an\nunearthly joy,--then suddenly the song went wailing away like the\nwinds of the winter from the marshlands when Spring appears from the\nSouth.\n\nSo it ended.  And a great silence fell fog-like over all that house,\nbreaking in upon the end of a chatty conversation that Cecilia,\nCountess of Birmingham, was enjoying with a friend.\n\nIn the dead hush Signorina Russiano rushed\nfrom the stage; she appeared again running among the audience, and\ndashed up to Lady Birmingham.\n\n'Take my soul,' she said; 'it is a beautiful soul.  It can worship\nGod, and knows the meaning of music and can imagine Paradise.  And if\nyou go to the marshlands with it you will see beautiful things;\nthere is an old town there built of lovely timbers, with ghosts in\nits streets.'\n\nLady Birmingham stared.  Everyone was standing up.  'See,' said\nSignorina Russiano, 'it is a beautiful soul.'\n\nAnd she clutched at her left\nbreast a little above the heart, and there was the soul shining in\nher hand, with the green and blue lights going round and round and\nthe purple flare in the midst.\n\n'Take it,' she said, 'and you will love all that is beautiful, and\nknow the four winds, each one by his name, and the songs of the\nbirds at dawn.  I do not want it, because I am not free.  Put it to\nyour left breast a little above the heart.'\n\nStill everybody was\nstanding up, and Lady Birmingham felt uncomfortable.\n\n'Please offer it to some one else,' she said.\n\n'But they all have souls already,' said Signorina Russiano.\n\nAnd everybody went on standing up.  And Lady Birmingham took the soul\nin her hand.\n\n'Perhaps it is lucky,' she said.\n\nShe felt that she wanted to pray.\n\nShe half-closed her eyes, and said '_Unberufen_'. Then she put the\nsoul to her left breast a little above the heart, and hoped that the\npeople would sit down and the singer go away.\n\nInstantly a heap of clothes collapsed before her.  For a moment, in\nthe shadow among the seats, those who were born in the dusk hour\nmight have seen a little brown thing leaping free from the clothes,\nthen it sprang into the bright light of the hall, and became\ninvisible to any human eye.\n\nIt dashed about for a little, then found the door, and presently was\nin the lamplit streets.\n\nTo those that were born in the dusk hour it might have been seen\nleaping rapidly wherever the streets ran northwards and eastwards,\ndisappearing from human sight as it passed under the lamps and\nappearing again beyond them with a marsh-light over its head.\n\nOnce a dog perceived it and gave chase, and was left far behind.\n\nThe cats of London, who are all born in the dusk hour, howled\nfearfully as it went by.\n\nPresently it came to the meaner streets, where the houses are\nsmaller.  Then it went due north-eastwards, leaping from roof to roof.\nAnd so in a few minutes it came to more open spaces, and then to the\ndesolate lands, where market gardens grow, which are neither town\nnor country.  Till at last the good black trees came into view, with\ntheir demoniac shapes in the night, and the grass was cold and wet,\nand the night-mist floated over it.  And a great white owl came by,\ngoing up and down in the dark.  And at all these things the little\nWild Thing rejoiced elvishly.\n\nAnd it left London far behind it, reddening the sky, and could\ndistinguish no longer its unlovely roar, but heard again the noises\nof the night.\n\nAnd now it would come through a hamlet glowing and comfortable in\nthe night; and now to the dark, wet, open fields again; and many an\nowl it overtook as they drifted through the night, a people friendly\nto the Elf-folk.  Sometimes it crossed wide rivers, leaping from star\nto star; and, choosing its way as it went, to avoid the hard rough\nroads, came before midnight to the East Anglian lands.\n\nAnd it heard\nthere the shout of the North Wind, who was dominant and angry, as he\ndrove southwards his adventurous geese; while the rushes bent before\nhim chaunting plaintively and low, like enslaved rowers of some\nfabulous trireme, bending and swinging under blows of the lash, and\nsinging all the while a doleful song.\n\nAnd it felt the good dank air that clothes by night the broad East\nAnglian lands, and came again to some old perilous pool where the\nsoft green mosses grew, and there plunged downward and downward into\nthe dear dark water till it felt the homely ooze once more coming\nup between its toes.  Thence, out of the lovely chill that is in the\nheart of the ooze, it arose renewed and rejoicing to dance upon the\nimage of the stars.\n\nI chanced to stand that night by the marsh's edge, forgetting in my\nmind the affairs of men; and I saw the marsh-fires come leaping up\nfrom all the perilous places.  And they came up by flocks the whole\nnight long to the number of a great multitude, and danced away\ntogether over the marshes.\n\nAnd I believe that there was a great rejoicing all that night among\nthe kith of the Elf-folk.\n\n\n\n\nThe Highwaymen\n\nTom o' the Roads had ridden his last ride, and was now alone in the\nnight.  From where he was, a man might see the white recumbent sheep\nand the black outline of the lonely downs, and the grey line of the\nfarther and lonelier downs beyond them; or in hollows far below him,\nout of the pitiless wind, he might see the grey smoke of hamlets\narising from black valleys.  But all alike was black to the eyes of\nTom, and all the sounds were silence in his ears; only his soul\nstruggled to slip from the iron chains and to pass southwards into\nParadise.  And the wind blew and blew.\n\nFor Tom tonight had nought but the wind to ride; they had taken his\ntrue black horse on the day when they took from him the green fields\nand the sky, men's voices and the laughter of women, and had left\nhim alone with chains about his neck to swing in the wind for ever.\nAnd the wind blew and blew.\n\nBut the soul of Tom o' the Roads was nipped by the cruel chains, and\nwhenever it struggled to escape it was beaten backwards into the\niron collar by the wind that blows from Paradise from the south.\nAnd swinging there by the neck, there fell away old sneers from off\nhis lips, and scoffs that he had long since scoffed at God fell from\nhis tongue, and there rotted old bad lusts out of his heart, and\nfrom his fingers the stains of deeds that were evil; and they all\nfell to the ground and grew there in pallid rings and clusters.  And\nwhen these ill things had all fallen away, Tom's soul was clean\nagain, as his early love had found it, a long while since in spring;\nand it swung up there in the wind with the bones of Tom, and with\nhis old torn coat and rusty chains.\n\nAnd the wind blew and blew.\n\nAnd ever and anon the souls of the sepultured, coming from\nconsecrated acres, would go by beating up wind to Paradise past the\nGallows Tree and past the soul of Tom, that might not go free.\n\nNight after night Tom watched the sheep upon the downs with empty\nhollow sockets, till his dead hair grew and covered his poor dead\nface, and hid the shame of it from the sheep.  And the wind blew and\nblew.\n\nSometimes on gusts of the wind came someone's tears, and beat and\nbeat against the iron chains, but could not rust them through.\nAnd the wind blew and blew.\n\nAnd every evening all the thoughts that Tom had ever uttered came\nflocking in from doing their work in the world, the work that may\nnot cease, and sat along the gallows branches and chirrupped to the\nsoul of Tom, the soul that might not go free.  All the thoughts that\nhe had ever uttered!  And the evil thoughts rebuked the soul that\nbore them because they might not die.  And all those that he had\nuttered the most furtively, chirrupped the loudest and the shrillest\nin the branches all the night.\n\nAnd all the thoughts that Tom had ever thought about himself now\npointed at the wet bones and mocked at the old torn coat.  But the\nthoughts that he had had of others were the only companions that his\nsoul had to soothe it in the night as it swung to and fro.  And they\ntwittered to the soul and cheered the poor dumb thing that could\nhave dreams no more, till there came a murderous thought and drove\nthem all away.\n\nAnd the wind blew and blew.\n\nPaul, Archbishop of Alois and Vayence, lay in his white sepulchre of\nmarble, facing full to the southwards towards Paradise.  And over\nhis tomb was sculptured the Cross of Christ, that his soul might\nhave repose.  No wind howled here as it howled in lonely tree-tops\nup upon the downs, but came with gentle breezes, orchard scented,\nover the low lands from Paradise from the southwards, and played\nabout forget-me-nots and grasses in the consecrated land where lay\nthe Reposeful round the sepulchre of Paul, Archbishop of Alois and\nVayence.  Easy it was for a man's soul to pass from such a\nsepulchre, and, flitting low over remembered fields, to come upon\nthe garden lands of Paradise and find eternal ease.\n\nAnd the wind blew and blew.\n\nIn a tavern of foul repute three men were lapping gin.  Their names\nwere Joe and Will and the gypsy Puglioni; none other names had they,\nfor of whom their fathers were they had no knowledge, but only dark\nsuspicions.\n\nSin had caressed and stroked their faces often with its paws, but\nthe face of Puglioni Sin had kissed all over the mouth and chin.\nTheir food was robbery and their pastime murder.  All of them had\nincurred the sorrow of God and the enmity of man.  They sat at a\ntable with a pack of cards before them, all greasy with the marks of\ncheating thumbs.  And they whispered to one another over their gin,\nbut so low that the landlord of the tavern at the other end of the\nroom could hear only muffled oaths, and knew not by Whom they swore\nor what they said.\n\nThese three were the staunchest friends that ever God had given unto\na man.  And he to whom their friendship had been given had nothing\nelse besides, saving some bones that swung in the wind and rain, and\nan old torn coat and iron chains, and a soul that might not go free.\n\nBut as the night wore on the three friends left their gin and stole\naway, and crept down to that graveyard where rested in his sepulchre\nPaul, Archbishop of Alois and Vayence.  At the edge of the\ngraveyard, but outside the consecrated ground, they dug a hasty\ngrave, two digging while one watched in the wind and rain.  And\nthe worms that crept in the unhallowed ground wondered and waited.\n\nAnd the terrible hour of midnight came upon them with its fears, and\nfound them still beside the place of tombs.  And the three friends\ntrembled at the horror of such an hour in such a place, and shivered\nin the wind and drenching rain, but still worked on.  And the wind\nblew and blew.\n\nSoon they had finished.  And at once they left the hungry grave with\nall its worms unfed, and went away over the wet fields stealthily\nbut in haste, leaving the place of tombs behind them in the\nmidnight.  And as they went they shivered, and each man as he\nshivered cursed the rain aloud.  And so they came to the spot where\nthey had hidden a ladder and a lantern.  There they held long debate\nwhether they should light the lantern, or whether they should go\nwithout it for fear of the King's men.  But in the end it seemed to\nthem better that they should have the light of their lantern, and\nrisk being taken by the King's men and hanged, than that they should\ncome suddenly face to face in the darkness with whatever one might\ncome face to face with a little after midnight about the Gallows\nTree.\n\nOn three roads in England whereon it was not the wont of folk to go\ntheir ways in safety, travellers tonight went unmolested.  But the\nthree friends, walking several paces wide of the King's highway,\napproached the Gallows Tree, and Will carried the lantern and Joe\nthe ladder, but Puglioni carried a great sword wherewith to do the\nwork which must be done.  When they came close, they saw how bad was\nthe case with Tom, for little remained of that fine figure of a man\nand nothing at all of his great resolute spirit, only as they came\nthey thought they heard a whimpering cry like the sound of a thing\nthat was caged and unfree.\n\nTo and fro, to and fro in the winds swung the bones and the soul of\nTom, for the sins that he had sinned on the King's highway against\nthe laws of the King; and with shadows and a lantern through the\ndarkness, at the peril of their lives, came the three friends that\nhis soul had won before it swung in chains.  Thus the seeds of Tom's\nown soul that he had sown all his life had grown into a Gallows Tree\nthat bore in season iron chains in clusters; while the careless\nseeds that he had strewn here and there, a kindly jest and a few\nmerry words, had grown into the triple friendship that would not\ndesert his bones.\n\nThen the three set the ladder against the tree, and Puglioni went up\nwith his sword in his right hand, and at the top of it he reached up\nand began to hack at the neck below the iron collar.  Presently, the\nbones and the old coat and the soul of Tom fell down with a rattle,\nand a moment afterwards his head that had watched so long alone\nswung clear from the swinging chain.  These things Will and Joe\ngathered up, and Puglioni came running down his ladder, and they\nheaped upon its rungs the terrible remains of their friend, and\nhastened away wet through with the rain, with the fear of phantoms\nin their hearts and horror lying before them on the ladder.  By two\no'clock they were down again in the valley out of the bitter wind,\nbut they went on past the open grave into the graveyard all among\nthe tombs, with their lantern and their ladder and the terrible\nthing upon it, which kept their friendship still.  Then these three,\nthat had robbed the Law of its due and proper victim, still sinned\non for what was still their friend, and levered out the marble slabs\nfrom the sacred sepulchre of Paul, Archbishop of Alois and Vayence.\nAnd from it they took the very bones of the Archbishop himself, and\ncarried them away to the eager grave that they had left, and put\nthem in and shovelled back the earth.  But all that lay on the\nladder they placed, with a few tears, within the great white\nsepulchre under the Cross of Christ, and put back the marble slabs.\n\nThence the soul of Tom, arising hallowed out of sacred ground, went\nat dawn down the valley, and, lingering a little about his mother's\ncottage and old haunts of childhood, passed on and came to the wide\nlands beyond the clustered homesteads.  There, there met with it all\nthe kindly thoughts that the soul of Tom had ever had, and they flew\nand sang beside it all the way southwards, until at last, with\nsinging all about it, it came to Paradise.\n\nBut Will and Joe and the gypsy Puglioni went back to their gin, and\nrobbed and cheated again in the tavern of foul repute, and knew not\nthat in their sinful lives they had sinned one sin at which the\nAngels smiled.\n\n\n\n\nIn The Twilight\n\nThe lock was quite crowded with boats when we capsized.  I went down\nbackwards for some few feet before I started to swim, then I came\nspluttering upwards towards the light; but, instead of reaching the\nsurface, I hit my head against the keel of a boat and went down\nagain.  I struck out almost at once and came up, but before I reached\nthe surface my head crashed against a boat for the second time, and\nI went right to the bottom.  I was confused and thoroughly\nfrightened.  I was desperately in need of air, and knew that if I hit\na boat for the third time I should never see the surface again.\nDrowning is a horrible death, notwithstanding all that has been said\nto the contrary.  My past life never occurred to my mind, but I\nthought of many trivial things that I might not do or see again if I\nwere drowned.  I swam up in a slanting direction, hoping to avoid the\nboat that I had struck.  Suddenly I saw all the boats in the lock\nquite clearly just above me, and every one of their curved varnished\nplanks and the scratches and chips upon their keels.  I saw several\ngaps among the boats where I might have swam up to the surface, but\nit did not seem worthwhile to try and get there, and I had forgotten\nwhy I wanted to.  Then all the people leaned over the sides of their\nboats: I saw the light flannel suits of the men and the coloured\nflowers in the women's hats, and I noticed details of their dresses\nquite distinctly.  Everybody in the boats was looking down at me;\nthen they all said to one another, 'We must leave him now,' and they\nand the boats went away; and there was nothing above me but the\nriver and the sky, and on either side of me were the green weeds\nthat grew in the mud, for I had somehow sunk back to the bottom\nagain.  The river as it flowed by murmured not unpleasantly in my\nears, and the rushes seemed to be whispering quite softly among\nthemselves.  Presently the murmuring of the river took the form of\nwords, and I heard it say, 'We must go on to the sea; we must leave\nhim now.'\n\nThen the river went away, and both its banks; and the\nrushes whispered, 'Yes, we must leave him now.' And they too\ndeparted, and I was left in a great emptiness staring up at the blue\nsky.  Then the great sky bent over me, and spoke quite softly like a\nkindly nurse soothing some little foolish child, and the sky said,\n'Goodbye.  All will be well.  Goodbye.' And I was sorry to lose the\nblue sky, but the sky went away.  Then I was alone, with nothing\nround about me; I could see no light, but it was not dark--there was\njust absolutely nothing, above me and below me and on every side.  I\nthought that perhaps I was dead, and that this might be eternity;\nwhen suddenly some great southern hills rose up all round about me,\nand I was lying on the warm, grassy slope of a valley in England.  It\nwas a valley that I had known well when I was young, but I had\nnot seen it now for many years.  Beside me stood the tall flower of\nthe mint; I saw the sweet-smelling thyme flower and one or two wild\nstrawberries.  There came up to me from fields below me the beautiful\nsmell of hay, and there was a break in the voice of the cuckoo.\nThere was a feeling of summer and of evening and of lateness and of\nSabbath in the air; the sky was calm and full of a strange colour,\nand the sun was low; the bells in the church in the village were all\na-ring, and the chimes went wandering with echoes up the valley\ntowards the sun, and whenever the echoes died a new chime was born.\nAnd all the people of the village walked up a stone-paved path under\na black oak porch and went into the church, and the chimes stopped\nand the people of the village began to sing, and the level sunlight\nshone on the white tombstones that stood all round the church.  Then\nthere was a stillness in the village, and shouts and laughter came\nup from the valley no more, only the occasional sound of the organ\nand of song.  And the blue butterflies, those that love the chalk,\ncame and perched themselves on the tall grasses, five or six\nsometimes on a single piece of grass, and they closed their wings\nand slept, and the grass bent a little beneath them.  And from the\nwoods along the tops of the hills the rabbits came hopping out and\nnibbled the grass, and hopped a little further and nibbled again,\nand the large daisies closed their petals up and the birds began\nto sing.\n\nThen the hills spoke, all the great chalk hills that I loved, and\nwith a deep and solemn voice they said, 'We have come to you to say\nGoodbye.'\n\nThen they all went away, and there was nothing again all round about\nme upon every side.  I looked everywhere for something on which to\nrest the eye.  Nothing.  Suddenly a low grey sky swept over me and a\nmoist air met my face; a great plain rushed up to me from the edge\nof the clouds; on two sides it touched the sky, and on two sides\nbetween it and the clouds a line of low hills lay.  One line of hills\nbrooded grey in the distance, the other stood a patchwork of little\nsquare green fields, with a few white cottages about it.  The plain\nwas an archipelago of a million islands each about a yard square or\nless, and everyone of them was red with heather.  I was back on the\nBog of Allen again after many years, and it was just the same as\never, though I had heard that they were draining it.  I was with an\nold friend whom I was glad to see again, for they had told me that\nhe died some years ago.  He seemed strangely young, but what\nsurprised me most was that he stood upon a piece of bright green\nmoss which I had always learned to think would never bear.  I was\nglad, too, to see the old bog again, and all the lovely things that\ngrew there--the scarlet mosses and the green mosses and the firm\nand friendly heather, and the deep silent water.  I saw a little\nstream that wandered vaguely through the bog, and little white\nshells down in the clear depths of it; I saw, a little way off, one\nof the great pools where no islands are, with rushes round its\nborders, where the duck love to come.  I looked long at that\nuntroubled world of heather, and then I looked at the white cottages\non the hill, and saw the grey smoke curling from their chimneys and\nknew that they burned turf there, and longed for the smell of\nburning turf again.  And far away there arose and came nearer the\nweird cry of wild and happy voices, and a flock of geese appeared\nthat was coming from the northward.  Then their cries blended into\none great voice of exultation, the voice of freedom, the voice of\nIreland, the voice of the Waste; and the voice said 'Goodbye to you.\nGoodbye!' and passed away into the distance; and as it passed, the\ntame geese on the farms cried out to their brothers up above them\nthat they were free.  Then the hills went away, and the bog and the\nsky went with them, and I was alone again, as lost souls are alone.\n\nThen there grew up beside me the red brick buildings of my first\nschool and the chapel that adjoined it.  The fields a little way off\nwere full of boys in white flannels playing cricket.  On the asphalt\nplaying ground, just by the schoolroom windows, stood Agamemnon,\nAchilles, and Odysseus, with their Argives armed behind them; but\nHector stepped down out of a ground-floor window, and in the\nschoolroom were all Priam's sons and the Ach\u00e6ans and fair Helen;\nand a little farther away the Ten Thousand drifted across the\nplayground, going up into the heart of Persia to place Cyrus on his\nbrother's throne.  And the boys that I knew called to me from the\nfields, and said 'Goodbye,' and they and the fields went away; and\nthe Ten Thousand said 'Goodbye,' each file as they passed me\nmarching swiftly, and they too disappeared.  And Hector and Agamemnon\nsaid 'Goodbye,' and the host of the Argives and of the Ach\u00e6ans; and\nthey all went away and the old school with them, and I was alone\nagain.\n\nThe next scene that filled the emptiness was rather dim: I was being\nled by my nurse along a little footpath over a common in Surrey.  She\nwas quite young.  Close by a band of gypsies had lit their fire, near\nthem their romantic caravan stood unhorsed, and the horse cropped\ngrass beside it.  It was evening, and the gypsies muttered round\ntheir fire in a tongue unknown and strange.  Then they all said in\nEnglish, 'Goodbye'. And the evening and the common and the\ncampfire went away.  And instead of this a white highway with\ndarkness and stars below it that led into darkness and stars, but at\nthe near end of the road were common fields and gardens, and there I\nstood close to a large number of people, men and women.  And I saw a\nman walking alone down the road away from me towards the darkness\nand the stars, and all the people called him by his name, and the\nman would not hear them, but walked on down the road, and the people\nwent on calling him by his name.  But I became irritated with the man\nbecause he would not stop or turn round when so many people called\nhim by his name, and it was a very strange name.  And I became weary\nof hearing the strange name so very often repeated, so that I made a\ngreat effort to call him, that he might listen and that the people\nmight stop repeating this strange name.  And with the effort I opened\nmy eyes wide, and the name that the people called was my own name,\nand I lay on the river's bank with men and women bending over me,\nand my hair was wet.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ghosts\n\nThe argument that I had with my brother in his great lonely house\nwill scarcely interest my readers.  Not those, at least, whom I hope\nmay be attracted by the experiment that I undertook, and by the\nstrange things that befell me in that hazardous region into which so\nlightly and so ignorantly I allowed my fancy to enter.  It was at\nOneleigh that I had visited him.\n\nNow Oneleigh stands in a wide isolation, in the midst of a dark\ngathering of old whispering cedars.  They nod their heads together\nwhen the North Wind comes, and nod again and agree, and furtively\ngrow still again, and say no more awhile.  The North Wind is to them\nlike a nice problem among wise old men; they nod their heads over\nit, and mutter about it all together.  They know much, those cedars,\nthey have been there so long.  Their grandsires knew Lebanon, and\nthe grandsires of these were the servants of the King of Tyre and\ncame to Solomon's court.  And amidst these black-haired children of\ngrey-headed Time stood the old house of Oneleigh.  I know not how\nmany centuries had lashed against it their evanescent foam of years;\nbut it was still unshattered, and all about it were the things of\nlong ago, as cling strange growths to some sea-defying rock.  Here,\nlike the shells of long-dead limpets, was armour that men encased\nthemselves in long ago; here, too, were tapestries of many colours,\nbeautiful as seaweed; no modern flotsam ever drifted hither, no\nearly Victorian furniture, no electric light.  The great trade\nroutes that littered the years with empty meat tins and cheap novels\nwere far from here.  Well, well, the centuries will shatter it and\ndrive its fragments on to distant shores.  Meanwhile, while it yet\nstood, I went on a visit there to my brother, and we argued about\nghosts.  My brother's intelligence on this subject seemed to me to\nbe in need of correction.  He mistook things imagined for things\nhaving an actual existence; he argued that second-hand evidence of\npersons having seen ghosts proved ghosts to exist.  I said that even\nif they had seen ghosts, this was no proof at all; nobody believes\nthat there are red rats, though there is plenty of first-hand\nevidence of men having seen them in delirium.  Finally, I said I\nwould see ghosts myself, and continue to argue against their actual\nexistence.  So I collected a handful of cigars and drank several\ncups of very strong tea, and went without my dinner, and retired\ninto a room where there was dark oak and all the chairs were covered\nwith tapestry; and my brother went to bed bored with our argument,\nand trying hard to dissuade me from making myself uncomfortable.\nAll the way up the old stairs as I stood at the bottom of them, and\nas his candle went winding up and up, I heard him still trying to\npersuade me to have supper and go to bed.\n\nIt was a windy winter, and outside the cedars were muttering I know\nnot what about; but I think that they were Tories of a school long\ndead, and were troubled about something new.  Within, a great damp\nlog upon the fireplace began to squeak and sing, and struck up a\nwhining tune, and a tall flame stood up over it and beat time, and\nall the shadows crowded round and began to dance.  In distant\ncorners old masses of darkness sat still like chaperones and never\nmoved.  Over there, in the darkest part of the room, stood a door\nthat was always locked.  It led into the hall, but no one ever used\nit; near that door something had happened once of which the family\nare not proud.  We do not speak of it.  There in the firelight stood\nthe venerable forms of the old chairs; the hands that had made their\ntapestries lay far beneath the soil, the needles with which they\nwrought were many separate flakes of rust.  No one wove now in that\nold room--no one but the assiduous ancient spiders who, watching\nby the deathbed of the things of yore, worked shrouds to hold their\ndust.  In shrouds about the cornices already lay the heart of the\noak wainscot that the worm had eaten out.\n\nSurely at such an hour, in such a room, a fancy already excited by\nhunger and strong tea might see the ghosts of former occupants.  I\nexpected nothing less.  The fire flickered and the shadows danced,\nmemories of strange historic things rose vividly in my mind; but\nmidnight chimed solemnly from a seven-foot clock, and nothing\nhappened.  My imagination would not be hurried, and the chill that\nis with the small hours had come upon me, and I had nearly abandoned\nmyself to sleep, when in the hall adjoining there arose the rustling\nof silk dresses that I had waited for and expected.  Then there\nentered two by two the high-born ladies and their gallants of\nJacobean times.  They were little more than shadows--very\ndignified shadows, and almost indistinct; but you have all read\nghost stories before, you have all seen in museums the dresses of\nthose times--there is little need to describe them; they entered,\nseveral of them, and sat down on the old chairs, perhaps a little\ncarelessly considering the value of the tapestries.  Then the\nrustling of their dresses ceased.\n\nWell--I had seen ghosts, and was neither frightened nor convinced\nthat ghosts existed.  I was about to get up out of my chair and go\nto bed, when there came a sound of pattering in the hall, a sound of\nbare feet coming over the polished floor, and every now and then a\nfoot would slip and I heard claws scratching along the wood as some\nfour-footed thing lost and regained its balance.  I was not\nfrightened, but uneasy.  The pattering came straight towards the\nroom that I was in, then I heard the sniffing of expectant nostrils;\nperhaps 'uneasy' was not the most suitable word to describe my\nfeelings then.  Suddenly a herd of black creatures larger than\nbloodhounds came galloping in; they had large pendulous ears, their\nnoses were to the ground sniffing, they went up to the lords and\nladies of long ago and fawned about them disgustingly.  Their eyes\nwere horribly bright, and ran down to great depths.  When I looked\ninto them I knew suddenly what these creatures were, and I was\nafraid.  They were the sins, the filthy, immortal sins of those\ncourtly men and women.\n\nHow demure she was, the lady that sat near me on an old-world\nchair--how demure she was, and how fair, to have beside her with its\njowl upon her lap a sin with such cavernous red eyes, a clear case\nof murder.  And you, yonder lady with the golden hair, surely not\nyou--and yet that fearful beast with the yellow eyes slinks from\nyou to yonder courtier there, and whenever one drives it away it\nslinks back to the other.  Over there a lady tries to smile as she\nstrokes the loathsome furry head of another's sin, but one of her\nown is jealous and intrudes itself under her hand.  Here sits an old\nnobleman with his grandson on his knee, and one of the great black\nsins of the grandfather is licking the child's face and has made the\nchild its own.  Sometimes a ghost would move and seek another chair,\nbut always his pack of sins would move behind him.  Poor ghosts,\npoor ghosts! how many flights they must have attempted for two\nhundred years from their hated sins, how many excuses they must have\ngiven for their presence, and the sins were with them still--and\nstill unexplained.  Suddenly one of them seemed to scent my living\nblood, and bayed horribly, and all the others left their ghosts at\nonce and dashed up to the sin that had given tongue.  The brute had\npicked up my scent near the door by which I had entered, and they\nmoved slowly nearer to me sniffing along the floor, and uttering\nevery now and then their fearful cry.  I saw that the whole thing\nhad gone too far.  But now they had seen me, now they were all about\nme, they sprang up trying to reach my throat; and whenever their\nclaws touched me, horrible thoughts came into my mind and\nunutterable desires dominated my heart.  I planned bestial things as\nthese creatures leaped around me, and planned them with a masterly\ncunning.  A great red-eyed murder was among the foremost of those\nfurry things from whom I feebly strove to defend my throat.\nSuddenly it seemed to me good that I should kill my brother.  It\nseemed important to me that I should not risk being punished.  I\nknew where a revolver was kept; after I had shot him, I would dress\nthe body up and put flour on the face like a man that had been\nacting as a ghost.  It would be very simple.  I would say that he had\nfrightened me--and the servants had heard us talking about ghosts.\nThere were one or two trivialities that would have to be arranged,\nbut nothing escaped my mind.  Yes, it seemed to me very good that I\nshould kill my brother as I looked into the red depths of this\ncreature's eyes.  But one last effort as they dragged me down--'If\ntwo straight lines cut one another,' I said, 'the opposite angles\nare equal.  Let AB, CD, cut one another at E, then the angles CEA,\nCEB equal two right angles (prop. xiii.).  Also CEA, AED equal two\nright angles.'\n\nI moved towards the door to get the revolver; a hideous exultation\narose among the beasts.  'But the angle CEA is common, therefore AED\nequals CEB.  In the same way CEA equals DEB.  _QED_.'  It was\nproved.  Logic and reason re-established themselves in my mind, there\nwere no dark hounds of sin, the tapestried chairs were empty.  It\nseemed to me an inconceivable thought that a man should murder his\nbrother.\n\n\n\n\nThe Whirlpool\n\nOnce going down to the shore of the great sea I came upon the\nWhirlpool lying prone upon the sand and stretching his huge limbs in\nthe sun.\n\nI said to him: 'Who art thou?'\n\nAnd he said:\n\n'I am named Nooz Wana, the Whelmer of Ships, and from the Straits of\nPondar Obed I am come, wherein it is my wont to vex the seas.  There\nI chased Leviathan with my hands when he was young and strong; often\nhe slipped through my fingers, and away into the weed forests that\ngrow below the storms in the dusk on the floor of the sea; but at\nlast I caught and tamed him.  For there I lurk upon the ocean's\nfloor, midway between the knees of either cliff, to guard the\npassage of the Straits from all the ships that seek the Further\nSeas; and whenever the white sails of the tall ships come swelling\nround the corner of the crag out of the sunlit spaces of the Known\nSea and into the dark of the Straits, then standing firm upon the\nocean's floor, with my knees a little bent, I take the waters of the\nStraits in both my hands and whirl them round my head.  But the ship\ncomes gliding on with the sound of the sailors singing on her decks,\nall singing songs of the islands and carrying the rumour of their\ncities to the lonely seas, till they see me suddenly astride athwart\ntheir course, and are caught in the waters as I whirl them round my\nhead.  Then I draw in the waters of the Straits towards me and\ndownwards, nearer and nearer to my terrible feet, and hear in my\nears above the roar of my waters the ultimate cry of the ship; for\njust before I drag them to the floor of ocean and stamp them asunder\nwith my wrecking feet, ships utter their ultimate cry, and with it\ngo the lives of all the sailors and passes the soul of the ship.  And\nin the ultimate cry of ships are the songs the sailors sing, and\ntheir hopes and all their loves, and the song of the wind among the\nmasts and timbers when they stood in the forest long ago, and the\nwhisper of the rain that made them grow, and the soul of the tall\npine-tree or the oak.  All this a ship gives up in one cry which she\nmakes at the last.  And at that moment I would pity the tall ship if\nI might; but a man may feel pity who sits in comfort by his fireside\ntelling tales in the winter--no pity are they permitted ever to\nfeel who do the work of the gods; and so when I have brought her\ncircling from round my shoulders to my waist and thence, with her\nmasts all sloping inwards, to my knees, and lower still and\ndownwards till her topmast pennants flutter against my ankles, then\nI, Nooz Wana, Whelmer of Ships, lift up my feet and trample her\nbeams asunder, and there go up again to the surface of the Straits\nonly a few broken timbers and the memories of the sailors and of\ntheir early loves to drift for ever down the empty seas.\n\n'Once in every hundred years, for one day only, I go to rest myself\nalong the shore and to sun my limbs on the sand, that the tall ships\nmay go through the unguarded Straits and find the Happy Isles.  And\nthe Happy Isles stand midmost among the smiles of the sunny Further\nSeas, and there the sailors may come upon content and long for\nnothing; or if they long for aught, they shall possess it.\n\n'There comes not Time with his devouring hours; nor any of the evils\nof the gods or men.  These are the islands whereto the souls of the\nsailors every night put in from all the world to rest from going up\nand down the seas, to behold again the vision of far-off intimate\nhills that lift their orchards high above the fields facing the\nsunlight, and for a while again to speak with the souls of old.  But\nabout the dawn dreams twitter and arise, and circling thrice around\nthe Happy Isles set out again to find the world of men, then follow\nthe souls of the sailors, as, at evening, with slow stroke of\nstately wings the heron follows behind the flight of multitudinous\nrooks; but the souls returning find awakening bodies and endure the\ntoil of the day.  Such are the Happy Isles, whereunto few have come,\nsave but as roaming shadows in the night, and for only a little\nwhile.\n\n'But longer than is needed to make me strong and fierce again I may\nnot stay, and at set of sun, when my arms are strong again, and when\nI feel in my legs that I can plant them fair and bent upon the floor\nof ocean, then I go back to take a new grip upon the waters of the\nStraits, and to guard the Further Seas again for a hundred years.\nBecause the gods are jealous, lest too many men shall pass to the\nHappy Isles and find content.  _For the gods have not content_.'\n\n\n\n\nThe Hurricane\n\nOne night I sat alone on the great down, looking over the edge of it\nat a murky, sullen city.  All day long with its smoke it had troubled\nthe holy sky, and now it sat there roaring in the distance and\nglared at me with its furnaces and lighted factory windows.  Suddenly\nI became aware that I was not the only enemy of that city, for I\nperceived the colossal form of the Hurricane walking over the down\ntowards me, playing idly with the flowers as he passed, and near me\nhe stopped and spake to the Earthquake, who had come up mole-like but\nvast out of a cleft in the earth.\n\n'Old friend,' said the Hurricane, 'rememberest when we wrecked the\nnations and drave the herds of the sea into new pasturage?'\n\n'Yes,' said the Earthquake, drowsily; 'Yes, yes.'\n\n'Old friend,' said the Hurricane, 'there are cities everywhere.  Over\nthy head while thou didst sleep they have built them constantly.  My\nfour children the Winds suffocate with the fumes of them, the\nvalleys are desolate of flowers, and the lovely forests are cut down\nsince last we went abroad together.'\n\nThe Earthquake lay there, with his snout towards the city, blinking\nat the lights, while the tall Hurricane stood beside him pointing\nfiercely at it.\n\n'Come,' said the Hurricane, 'let us fare forth again and destroy\nthem, that all the lovely forests may come back and the furry\ncreeping things.  Thou shalt whelm these cities utterly and drive the\npeople forth, and I will smite them in the shelterless places and\nsweep their desecrations from the sea.  Wilt thou come forth with me\nand do this thing for the glory of it? Wilt thou wreck the world\nagain as we did, thou and I, or ever Man had come? Wilt thou come\nforth to this place at this hour tomorrow night?'\n\n'Yes,' said the Earthquake, 'Yes,' and he crept to his cleft again,\nand head foremost waddled down into the abysses.\n\nWhen the Hurricane strode away, I got up quietly and departed, but\nat that hour of the next night I came up cautiously to the same\nspot.  There I found the huge grey form of the Hurricane alone, with\nhis head bowed in his hands, weeping; for the Earthquake sleeps long\nand heavily in the abysses, and he would not wake.\n\n\n\n\nThe Fortress Unvanquishable, Save For Sacnoth\n\nIn a wood older than record, a foster brother of the hills, stood\nthe village of Allathurion; and there was peace between the people\nof that village and all the folk who walked in the dark ways of the\nwood, whether they were human or of the tribes of the beasts or of\nthe race of the fairies and the elves and the little sacred spirits\nof trees and streams.  Moreover, the village people had peace among\nthemselves and between them and their lord, Lorendiac.  In front of\nthe village was a wide and grassy space, and beyond this the great\nwood again, but at the back the trees came right up to the houses,\nwhich, with their great beams and wooden framework and thatched\nroofs, green with moss, seemed almost to be a part of the forest.\n\nNow in the time I tell of, there was trouble in Allathurion, for of\nan evening fell dreams were wont to come slipping through the tree\ntrunks and into the peaceful village; and they assumed dominion of\nmen's minds and led them in watches of the night through the cindery\nplains of Hell.  Then the magician of that village made spells\nagainst those fell dreams; yet still the dreams came flitting\nthrough the trees as soon as the dark had fallen, and led men's\nminds by night into terrible places and caused them to praise Satan\nopenly with their lips.\n\nAnd men grew afraid of sleep in Allathurion.  And they grew worn and\npale, some through the want of rest, and others from fear of the\nthings they saw on the cindery plains of Hell.\n\nThen the magician of the village went up into the tower of his\nhouse, and all night long those whom fear kept awake could see his\nwindow high up in the night glowing softly alone.  The next day, when\nthe twilight was far gone and night was gathering fast, the magician\nwent away to the forest's edge, and uttered there the spell that he\nhad made.  And the spell was a compulsive, terrible thing, having a\npower over evil dreams and over spirits of ill; for it was a verse\nof forty lines in many languages, both living and dead, and had in\nit the word wherewith the people of the plains are wont to curse\ntheir camels, and the shout wherewith the whalers of the north lure\nthe whales shoreward to be killed, and a word that causes elephants\nto trumpet; and every one of the forty lines closed with a rhyme for\n'wasp'.\n\nAnd still the dreams came flitting through the forest, and led men's\nsouls into the plains of Hell.  Then the magician knew that the\ndreams were from Gaznak.  Therefore he gathered the people of the\nvillage, and told them that he had uttered his mightiest spell--a\nspell having power over all that were human or of the tribes of the\nbeasts; and that since it had not availed the dreams must come from\nGaznak, the greatest magician among the spaces of the stars.  And he\nread to the people out of the Book of Magicians, which tells the\ncomings of the comet and foretells his coming again.  And he told\nthem how Gaznak rides upon the comet, and how he visits Earth once\nin every two hundred and thirty years, and makes for himself a vast,\ninvincible fortress and sends out dreams to feed on the minds of\nmen, and may never be vanquished but by the sword Sacnoth.\n\nAnd a cold fear fell on the hearts of the villagers when they found\nthat their magician had failed them.\n\nThen spake Leothric, son of the Lord Lorendiac, and twenty years old\nwas he: 'Good Master, what of the sword Sacnoth?'\n\nAnd the village magician answered: 'Fair Lord, no such sword as yet\nis wrought, for it lies as yet in the hide of Tharagavverug,\nprotecting his spine.'\n\nThen said Leothric: 'Who is Tharagavverug, and where may he be\nencountered?'\n\nAnd the magician of Allathurion answered: 'He is the dragon-crocodile\nwho haunts the Northern marshes and ravages the homesteads\nby their marge.  And the hide of his back is of steel, and his under\nparts are of iron; but along the midst of his back, over his spine,\nthere lies a narrow strip of unearthly steel.  This strip of steel is\nSacnoth, and it may be neither cleft nor molten, and there is\nnothing in the world that may avail to break it, nor even leave a\nscratch upon its surface.  It is of the length of a good sword, and\nof the breadth thereof.  Shouldst thou prevail against Tharagavverug,\nhis hide may be melted away from Sacnoth in a furnace; but there is\nonly one thing that may sharpen Sacnoth's edge, and this is one of\nTharagavverug's own steel eyes; and the other eye thou must fasten\nto Sacnoth's hilt, and it will watch for thee.  But it is a hard task\nto vanquish Tharagavverug, for no sword can pierce his hide; his\nback cannot be broken, and he can neither burn nor drown.  In one way\nonly can Tharagavverug die, and that is by starving.'\n\nThen sorrow fell upon Leothric, but the magician spoke on:\n\n'If a man drive Tharagavverug away from his food with a stick for\nthree days, he will starve on the third day at sunset.  And though he\nis not vulnerable, yet in one spot he may take hurt, for his nose is\nonly of lead.  A sword would merely lay bare the uncleavable bronze\nbeneath, but if his nose be smitten constantly with a stick he will\nalways recoil from the pain, and thus may Tharagavverug, to left and\nright, be driven away from his food.'\n\nThen Leothric said: 'What is Tharagavverug's food?'\n\nAnd the magician of Allathurion said: 'His food is men.'\n\nBut Leothric went straightway thence, and cut a great staff from a\nhazel tree, and slept early that evening.  But the next morning,\nawaking from troubled dreams, he arose before the dawn, and, taking\nwith him provisions for five days, set out through the forest\nnorthwards towards the marshes.  For some hours he moved through the\ngloom of the forest, and when he emerged from it the sun was above\nthe horizon shining on pools of water in the waste land.  Presently\nhe saw the claw-marks of Tharagavverug deep in the soil, and the\ntrack of his tail between them like a furrow in a field.  Then\nLeothric followed the tracks till he heard the bronze heart of\nTharagavverug before him, booming like a bell.\n\nAnd Tharagavverug, it being the hour when he took the first meal of\nthe day, was moving towards a village with his heart tolling.  And\nall the people of the village were come out to meet him, as it was\ntheir wont to do; for they abode not the suspense of awaiting\nTharagavverug and of hearing him sniffing brazenly as he went from\ndoor to door, pondering slowly in his metal mind what habitant he\nshould choose.  And none dared to flee, for in the days when the\nvillagers fled from Tharagavverug, he, having chosen his victim,\nwould track him tirelessly, like a doom.  Nothing availed them\nagainst Tharagavverug.  Once they climbed the trees when he came, but\nTharagavverug went up to one, arching his back and leaning over\nslightly, and rasped against the trunk until it fell.  And when\nLeothric came near, Tharagavverug saw him out of one of his small\nsteel eyes and came towards him leisurely, and the echoes of his\nheart swirled up through his open mouth.  And Leothric stepped\nsideways from his onset, and came between him and the village and\nsmote him on the nose, and the blow of the stick made a dint in the\nsoft lead.  And Tharagavverug swung clumsily away, uttering one\nfearful cry like the sound of a great church bell that had become\npossessed of a soul that fluttered upward from the tombs at night--an\nevil soul, giving the bell a voice.  Then he attacked Leothric,\nsnarling, and again Leothric leapt aside, and smote him on the nose\nwith his stick.  Tharagavverug uttered like a bell howling.  And\nwhenever the dragon-crocodile attacked him, or turned towards the\nvillage, Leothric smote him again.\n\nSo all day long Leothric drove the monster with a stick, and he drove\nhim farther and farther from his prey, with his heart tolling\nangrily and his voice crying out for pain.\n\nTowards evening Tharagavverug ceased to snap at Leothric, but ran\nbefore him to avoid the stick, for his nose was sore and shining;\nand in the gloaming the villagers came out and danced to cymbal and\npsaltery.  When Tharagavverug heard the cymbal and psaltery, hunger\nand anger came upon him, and he felt as some lord might feel who was\nheld by force from the banquet in his own castle and heard the\ncreaking spit go round and round and the good meat crackling on it.\nAnd all that night he attacked Leothric fiercely, and oft-times\nnearly caught him in the darkness; for his gleaming eyes of steel\ncould see as well by night as by day.  And Leothric gave ground\nslowly till the dawn, and when the light came they were near the\nvillage again; yet not so near to it as they had been when they\nencountered, for Leothric drove Tharagavverug farther in the day\nthan Tharagavverug had forced him back in the night.  Then Leothric\ndrove him again with his stick till the hour came when it was the\ncustom of the dragon-crocodile to find his man.  One third of his man\nhe would eat at the time he found him, and the rest at noon and\nevening.  But when the hour came for finding his man a great\nfierceness came on Tharagavverug, and he grabbed rapidly at\nLeothric, but could not seize him, and for a long while neither of\nthem would retire.  But at last the pain of the stick on his leaden\nnose overcame the hunger of the dragon-crocodile, and he turned from\nit howling.  From that moment Tharagavverug weakened.  All that day\nLeothric drove him with his stick, and at night both held their\nground; and when the dawn of the third day was come the heart of\nTharagavverug beat slower and fainter.  It was as though a tired man\nwas ringing a bell.  Once Tharagavverug nearly seized a frog, but\nLeothric snatched it away just in time.  Towards noon the\ndragon-crocodile lay still for a long while, and Leothric stood near\nhim and leaned on his trusty stick.  He was very tired and sleepless,\nbut had more leisure now for eating his provisions.  With\nTharagavverug the end was coming fast, and in the afternoon his\nbreath came hoarsely, rasping in his throat.  It was as the sound of\nmany huntsmen blowing blasts on horns, and towards evening his breath\ncame faster but fainter, like the sound of a hunt going furious to\nthe distance and dying away, and he made desperate rushes towards\nthe village; but Leothric still leapt about him, battering his\nleaden nose.  Scarce audible now at all was the sound of his heart:\nit was like a church bell tolling beyond hills for the death of some\none unknown and far away.  Then the sun set and flamed in the village\nwindows, and a chill went over the world, and in some small garden a\nwoman sang; and Tharagavverug lifted up his head and starved, and\nhis life went from his invulnerable body, and Leothric lay down\nbeside him and slept.  And later in the starlight the villagers came\nout and carried Leothric, sleeping, to the village, all praising him\nin whispers as they went.  They laid him down upon a couch in a\nhouse, and danced outside in silence, without psaltery or cymbal.\nAnd the next day, rejoicing, to Allathurion they hauled the\ndragon-crocodile.  And Leothric went with them, holding his battered\nstaff; and a tall, broad man, who was smith of Allathurion, made a\ngreat furnace, and melted Tharagavverug away till only Sacnoth was\nleft, gleaming among the ashes.  Then he took one of the small eyes\nthat had been chiselled out, and filed an edge on Sacnoth, and\ngradually the steel eye wore away facet by facet, but ere it was\nquite gone it had sharpened redoubtably Sacnoth.  But the other eye\nthey set in the butt of the hilt, and it gleamed there bluely.\n\nAnd that night Leothric arose in the dark and took the sword, and\nwent westwards to find Gaznak; and he went through the dark forest\ntill the dawn, and all the morning and till the afternoon.  But in\nthe afternoon he came into the open and saw in the midst of The\nLand Where No Man Goeth the fortress of Gaznak, mountainous before\nhim, little more than a mile away.\n\nAnd Leothric saw that the land was marsh and desolate.  And the\nfortress went up all white out of it, with many buttresses, and was\nbroad below but narrowed higher up, and was full of gleaming\nwindows with the light upon them.  And near the top of it a few white\nclouds were floating, but above them some of its pinnacles\nreappeared.  Then Leothric advanced into the marshes, and the eye of\nTharagavverug looked out warily from the hilt of Sacnoth; for\nTharagavverug had known the marshes well, and the sword nudged\nLeothric to the right or pulled him to the left away from the\ndangerous places, and so brought him safely to the fortress walls.\n\nAnd in the wall stood doors like precipices of steel, all studded\nwith boulders of iron, and above every window were terrible\ngargoyles of stone; and the name of the fortress shone on the wall,\nwrit large in letters of brass: 'The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save\nFor Sacnoth.'\n\nThen Leothric drew and revealed Sacnoth, and all the gargoyles\ngrinned, and the grin went flickering from face to face right up\ninto the cloud-abiding gables.\n\nAnd when Sacnoth was revealed and all the gargoyles grinned, it was\nlike the moonlight emerging from a cloud to look for the first time\nupon a field of blood, and passing swiftly over the wet faces of the\nslain that lie together in the horrible night.  Then Leothric\nadvanced towards a door, and it was mightier than the marble quarry,\nSacremona, from which of old men cut enormous slabs to build the\nAbbey of the Holy Tears.  Day after day they wrenched out the very\nribs of the hill until the Abbey was builded, and it was more\nbeautiful than anything in stone.  Then the priests blessed\nSacremona, and it had rest, and no more stone was ever taken from it\nto build the houses of men.  And the hill stood looking southwards\nlonely in the sunlight, defaced by that mighty scar.  So vast was\nthe door of steel.  And the name of the door was The Porte Resonant,\nthe Way of Egress for War.\n\nThen Leothric smote upon the Porte Resonant with Sacnoth, and the\necho of Sacnoth went ringing through the halls, and all the dragons\nin the fortress barked.  And when the baying of the remotest dragon\nhad faintly joined in the tumult, a window opened far up among the\nclouds below the twilit gables, and a woman screamed, and far away\nin Hell her father heard her and knew that her doom was come.\n\nAnd Leothric went on smiting terribly with Sacnoth, and the grey\nsteel of the Porte Resonant, the Way of Egress for War, that was\ntempered to resist the swords of the world, came away in ringing\nslices.\n\nThen Leothric, holding Sacnoth in his hand, went in through the hole\nthat he had hewn in the door, and came into the unlit, cavernous\nhall.\n\nAn elephant fled trumpeting.  And Leothric stood still, holding\nSacnoth.  When the sound of the feet of the elephant had died away in\nthe remoter corridors, nothing more stirred, and the cavernous hall\nwas still.\n\nPresently the darkness of the distant halls became musical with the\nsound of bells, all coming nearer and nearer.\n\nStill Leothric waited in the dark, and the bells rang louder and\nlouder, echoing through the halls, and there appeared a procession\nof men on camels riding two by two from the interior of the\nfortress, and they were armed with scimitars of Assyrian make and\nwere all clad with mail, and chain-mail hung from their helmets\nabout their faces, and flapped as the camels moved.  And they all\nhalted before Leothric in the cavernous hall, and the camel bells\nclanged and stopped.  And the leader said to Leothric:\n\n'The Lord Gaznak has desired to see you die before him.  Be pleased\nto come with us, and we can discourse by the way of the manner in\nwhich the Lord Gaznak has desired to see you die.'\n\nAnd as he said this he unwound a chain of iron that was coiled upon\nhis saddle, and Leothric answered:\n\n'I would fain go with you, for I am come to slay Gaznak.'\n\nThen all the camel-guard of Gaznak laughed hideously, disturbing the\nvampires that were asleep in the measureless vault of the roof.  And\nthe leader said:\n\n'The Lord Gaznak is immortal, save for Sacnoth, and weareth armour\nthat is proof even against Sacnoth himself, and hath a sword the\nsecond most terrible in the world.'\n\nThen Leothric said: 'I am the Lord of the sword Sacnoth.'\n\nAnd he advanced towards the camel-guard of Gaznak, and Sacnoth\nlifted up and down in his hand as though stirred by an exultant\npulse.  Then the camel-guard of Gaznak fled, and the riders leaned\nforward and smote their camels with whips, and they went away with a\ngreat clamour of bells through colonnades and corridors and vaulted\nhalls, and scattered into the inner darknesses of the fortress.  When\nthe last sound of them had died away, Leothric was in doubt which\nway to go, for the camel-guard was dispersed in many directions, so\nhe went straight on till he came to a great stairway in the midst of\nthe hall.  Then Leothric set his foot in the middle of a wide step,\nand climbed steadily up the stairway for five minutes.  Little light\nwas there in the great hall through which Leothric ascended, for it\nonly entered through arrow slits here and there, and in the world\noutside evening was waning fast.  The stairway led up to two folding\ndoors, and they stood a little ajar, and through the crack Leothric\nentered and tried to continue straight on, but could get no farther,\nfor the whole room seemed to be full of festoons of ropes which\nswung from wall to wall and were looped and draped from the ceiling.\nThe whole chamber was thick and black with them.  They were soft and\nlight to the touch, like fine silk, but Leothric was unable to break\nany one of them, and though they swung away from him as he pressed\nforward, yet by the time he had gone three yards they were all about\nhim like a heavy cloak.  Then Leothric stepped back and drew Sacnoth,\nand Sacnoth divided the ropes without a sound, and without a sound\nthe severed pieces fell to the floor.  Leothric went forward slowly,\nmoving Sacnoth in front of him up and down as he went.  When he was\ncome into the middle of the chamber, suddenly, as he parted with\nSacnoth a great hammock of strands, he saw a spider before him that\nwas larger than a ram, and the spider looked at him with eyes that\nwere little, but in which there was much sin, and said:\n\n'Who are you that spoil the labour of years all done to the honour\nof Satan?'\n\nAnd Leothric answered: 'I am Leothric, son of Lorendiac.'\n\nAnd the spider said: 'I will make a rope at once to hang you with.'\n\nThen Leothric parted another bunch of strands, and came nearer to\nthe spider as he sat making his rope, and the spider, looking up\nfrom his work, said: 'What is that sword which is able to sever my\nropes?'\n\nAnd Leothric said: 'It is Sacnoth.'\n\nThereat the black hair that hung over the face of the spider parted\nto left and right, and the spider frowned; then the hair fell back\ninto its place, and hid everything except the sin of the little eyes\nwhich went on gleaming lustfully in the dark.  But before Leothric\ncould reach him, he climbed away with his hands, going up by one of\nhis ropes to a lofty rafter, and there sat, growling.  But clearing\nhis way with Sacnoth, Leothric passed through the chamber, and came\nto the farther door; and the door being shut, and the handle far up\nout of his reach, he hewed his way through it with Sacnoth in the\nsame way as he had through the Porte Resonant, the Way of Egress for\nWar.  And so Leothric came into a well-lit chamber, where Queens and\nPrinces were banqueting together, all at a great table; and\nthousands of candles were glowing all about, and their light shone\nin the wine that the Princes drank and on the huge gold candelabra,\nand the royal faces were irradiant with the glow, and the white\ntable-cloth and the silver plates and the jewels in the hair of the\nQueens, each jewel having a historian all to itself, who wrote no\nother chronicles all his days.  Between the table and the door there\nstood two hundred footmen in two rows of one hundred facing one\nanother.  Nobody looked at Leothric as he entered through the hole in\nthe door, but one of the Princes asked a question of a footman, and\nthe question was passed from mouth to mouth by all the hundred\nfootmen till it came to the last one nearest Leothric; and he said\nto Leothric, without looking at him:\n\n'What do you seek here?'\n\nAnd Leothric answered: 'I seek to slay Gaznak.'\n\nAnd footman to footman repeated all the way to the table: 'He seeks\nto slay Gaznak.'\n\nAnd another question came down the line of footmen: 'What is your\nname?'\n\nAnd the line that stood opposite took his answer back.\n\nThen one of the Princes said: 'Take him away where we shall not hear\nhis screams.'\n\nAnd footman repeated it to footman till it came to the last two, and\nthey advanced to seize Leothric.\n\nThen Leothric showed to them his sword, saying, 'This is Sacnoth,'\nand both of them said to the man nearest: 'It is Sacnoth;' then\nscreamed and fled away.\n\nAnd two by two, all up the double line, footman to footman repeated,\n'It is Sacnoth,' then screamed and fled, till the last two gave the\nmessage to the table, and all the rest had gone.  Hurriedly then\narose the Queens and Princes, and fled out of the chamber.  And the\ngoodly table, when they were all gone, looked small and disorderly\nand awry.  And to Leothric, pondering in the desolate chamber by what\ndoor he should pass onwards, there came from far away the sounds of\nmusic, and he knew that it was the magical musicians playing to\nGaznak while he slept.\n\nThen Leothric, walking towards the distant music, passed out by the\ndoor opposite to the one through which he had cloven his entrance,\nand so passed into a chamber vast as the other, in which were many\nwomen, weirdly beautiful.  And they all asked him of his quest, and\nwhen they heard that it was to slay Gaznak, they all besought him to\ntarry among them, saying that Gaznak was immortal, save for Sacnoth,\nand also that they had need of a knight to protect them from the\nwolves that rushed round and round the wainscot all the night and\nsometimes broke in upon them through the mouldering oak.  Perhaps\nLeothric had been tempted to tarry had they been human women, for\ntheirs was a strange beauty, but he perceived that instead of eyes\nthey had little flames that flickered in their sockets, and knew\nthem to be the fevered dreams of Gaznak.  Therefore he said:\n\n'I have a business with Gaznak and with Sacnoth,' and passed on\nthrough the chamber.\n\nAnd at the name of Sacnoth those women screamed, and the flames of\ntheir eyes sank low and dwindled to sparks.\n\nAnd Leothric left them, and, hewing with Sacnoth, passed through the\nfarther door.\n\nOutside he felt the night air on his face, and found that he stood\nupon a narrow way between two abysses.  To left and right of him, as\nfar as he could see, the walls of the fortress ended in a profound\nprecipice, though the roof still stretched above him; and before him\nlay the two abysses full of stars, for they cut their way through\nthe whole Earth and revealed the under sky; and threading its course\nbetween them went the way, and it sloped upward and its sides were\nsheer.  And beyond the abysses, where the way led up to the farther\nchambers of the fortress, Leothric heard the musicians playing their\nmagical tune.  So he stepped on to the way, which was scarcely a\nstride in width, and moved along it holding Sacnoth naked.  And to\nand fro beneath him in each abyss whirred the wings of vampires\npassing up and down, all giving praise to Satan as they flew.\nPresently he perceived the dragon Thok lying upon the way,\npretending to sleep, and his tail hung down into one of the abysses.\n\nAnd Leothric went towards him, and when he was quite close Thok\nrushed at Leothric.\n\nAnd he smote deep with Sacnoth, and Thok tumbled into the abyss,\nscreaming, and his limbs made a whirring in the darkness as he fell,\nand he fell till his scream sounded no louder than a whistle and\nthen could be heard no more.  Once or twice Leothric saw a star blink\nfor an instant and reappear again, and this momentary eclipse of a\nfew stars was all that remained in the world of the body of Thok.\nAnd Lunk, the brother of Thok, who had lain a little behind him, saw\nthat this must be Sacnoth and fled lumbering away.  And all the while\nthat he walked between the abysses, the mighty vault of the roof of\nthe fortress still stretched over Leothric's head, all filled with\ngloom.  Now, when the further side of the abyss came into view,\nLeothric saw a chamber that opened with innumerable arches upon the\ntwin abysses, and the pillars of the arches went away into the\ndistance and vanished in the gloom to left and right.\n\nFar down the dim precipice on which the pillars stood he could see\nwindows small and closely barred, and between the bars there showed\nat moments, and disappeared again, things that I shall not speak of.\n\nThere was no light here except for the great Southern stars that\nshone below the abysses, and here and there in the chamber through\nthe arches lights that moved furtively without the sound of\nfootfall.\n\nThen Leothric stepped from the way, and entered the great chamber.\n\nEven to himself he seemed but a tiny dwarf as he walked under one of\nthose colossal arches.\n\nThe last faint light of evening flickered through a window painted\nin sombre colours commemorating the achievements of Satan upon\nEarth.  High up in the wall the window stood, and the streaming\nlights of candles lower down moved stealthily away.\n\nOther light there was none, save for a faint blue glow from the\nsteel eye of Tharagavverug that peered restlessly about it from the\nhilt of Sacnoth.  Heavily in the chamber hung the clammy odour of a\nlarge and deadly beast.\n\nLeothric moved forward slowly with the blade of Sacnoth in\nfront of him feeling for a foe, and the eye in the hilt of it looking\nout behind.\n\nNothing stirred.\n\nIf anything lurked behind the pillars of the colonnade that held\naloft the roof, it neither breathed nor moved.\n\nThe music of the magical musicians sounded from very near.\n\nSuddenly the great doors on the far side of the chamber opened to\nleft and right.  For some moments Leothric saw nothing move, and\nwaited clutching Sacnoth.  Then Wong Bongerok came towards him,\nbreathing.\n\nThis was the last and faithfullest guard of Gaznak, and came from\nslobbering just now his master's hand.\n\nMore as a child than a dragon was Gaznak wont to treat him, giving\nhim often in his fingers tender pieces of man all smoking from his\ntable.\n\nLong and low was Wong Bongerok, and subtle about the eyes, and he\ncame breathing malice against Leothric out of his faithful breast,\nand behind him roared the armoury of his tail, as when sailors drag\nthe cable of the anchor all rattling down the deck.\n\nAnd well Wong Bongerok knew that he now faced Sacnoth, for it had\nbeen his wont to prophesy quietly to himself for many years as he\nlay curled at the feet of Gaznak.\n\nAnd Leothric stepped forward into the blast of his breath, and\nlifted Sacnoth to strike.\n\nBut when Sacnoth was lifted up, the eye of Tharagavverug in the butt\nof the hilt beheld the dragon and perceived his subtlety.\n\nFor he opened his mouth wide, and revealed to Leothric the ranks of\nhis sabre teeth, and his leather gums flapped upwards.  But while\nLeothric made to smite at his head, he shot forward scorpion-wise\nover his head the length of his armoured tail.  All this the eye\nperceived in the hilt of Sacnoth, who smote suddenly sideways.  Not\nwith the edge smote Sacnoth, for, had he done so, the severed end of\nthe tail had still come hurtling on, as some pine tree that the\navalanche has hurled point foremost from the cliff right through the\nbroad breast of some mountaineer.  So had Leothric been transfixed;\nbut Sacnoth smote sideways with the flat of his blade, and sent the\ntail whizzing over Leothric's left shoulder; and it rasped upon his\narmour as it went, and left a groove upon it.  Sideways then at\nLeothric smote the foiled tail of Wong Bongerok, and Sacnoth parried,\nand the tail went shrieking up the blade and over Leothric's head.\nThen Leothric and Wong Bongerok fought sword to tooth, and the\nsword smote as only Sacnoth can, and the evil faithful life of Wong\nBongerok the dragon went out through the wide wound.\n\nThen Leothric walked on past that dead monster, and the armoured\nbody still quivered a little.  And for a while it was like all the\nploughshares in a county working together in one field behind tired\nand struggling horses; then the quivering ceased, and Wong Bongerok\nlay still to rust.\n\nAnd Leothric went on to the open gates, and Sacnoth dripped quietly\nalong the floor.\n\nBy the open gates through which Wong Bongerok had entered, Leothric\ncame into a corridor echoing with music.  This was the first place\nfrom which Leothric could see anything above his head, for hitherto\nthe roof had ascended to mountainous heights and had stretched\nindistinct in the gloom.  But along the narrow corridor hung huge\nbells low and near to his head, and the width of each brazen bell\nwas from wall to wall, and they were one behind the other.  And as he\npassed under each the bell uttered, and its voice was mournful and\ndeep, like to the voice of a bell speaking to a man for the last\ntime when he is newly dead.  Each bell uttered once as Leothric came\nunder it, and their voices sounded solemnly and wide apart at\nceremonious intervals.  For if he walked slow, these bells came\ncloser together, and when he walked swiftly they moved farther\napart.  And the echoes of each bell tolling above his head went on\nbefore him whispering to the others.  Once when he stopped they all\njangled angrily till he went on again.\n\nBetween these slow and boding notes came the sound of the magical\nmusicians.  They were playing a dirge now very mournfully.\n\nAnd at last Leothric came to the end of the Corridor of the Bells,\nand beheld there a small black door.  And all the corridor behind him\nwas full of the echoes of the tolling, and they all muttered to one\nanother about the ceremony; and the dirge of the musicians came\nfloating slowly through them like a procession of foreign elaborate\nguests, and all of them boded ill to Leothric.\n\nThe black door opened at once to the hand of Leothric, and he found\nhimself in the open air in a wide court paved with marble.  High over\nit shone the moon, summoned there by the hand of Gaznak.\n\nThere Gaznak slept, and around him sat his magical musicians, all\nplaying upon strings.  And, even sleeping, Gaznak was clad in armour,\nand only his wrists and face and neck were bare.\n\nBut the marvel of that place was the dreams of Gaznak; for beyond\nthe wide court slept a dark abyss, and into the abyss there poured a\nwhite cascade of marble stairways, and widened out below into\nterraces and balconies with fair white statues on them, and\ndescended again in a wide stairway, and came to lower terraces in\nthe dark, where swart uncertain shapes went to and fro.  All these\nwere the dreams of Gaznak, and issued from his mind, and, becoming\ngleaming marble, passed over the edge of the abyss as the musicians\nplayed.  And all the while out of the mind of Gaznak, lulled by that\nstrange music, went spires and pinnacles beautiful and slender, ever\nascending skywards.  And the marble dreams moved slow in time to the\nmusic.  When the bells tolled and the musicians played their dirge,\nugly gargoyles came out suddenly all over the spires and pinnacles,\nand great shadows passed swiftly down the steps and terraces, and\nthere was hurried whispering in the abyss.\n\nWhen Leothric stepped from the black door, Gaznak opened his eyes.\nHe looked neither to left nor right, but stood up at once facing\nLeothric.\n\nThen the magicians played a deathspell on their strings, and there\narose a humming along the blade of Sacnoth as he turned the spell\naside.  When Leothric dropped not down, and they heard the humming of\nSacnoth, the magicians arose and fled, all wailing, as they went,\nupon their strings.\n\nThen Gaznak drew out screaming from its sheath the sword that was\nthe mightiest in the world except for Sacnoth, and slowly walked\ntowards Leothric; and he smiled as he walked, although his own\ndreams had foretold his doom.  And when Leothric and Gaznak came\ntogether, each looked at each, and neither spoke a word; but they\nsmote both at once, and their swords met, and each sword knew the\nother and from whence he came.  And whenever the sword of Gaznak\nsmote on the blade of Sacnoth it rebounded gleaming, as hail from\noff slated roofs; but whenever it fell upon the armour of Leothric,\nit stripped it off in sheets.  And upon Gaznak's armour Sacnoth fell\noft and furiously, but ever he came back snarling, leaving no mark\nbehind, and as Gaznak fought he held his left hand hovering close\nover his head.  Presently Leothric smote fair and fiercely at his\nenemy's neck, but Gaznak, clutching his own head by the hair, lifted\nit high aloft, and Sacnoth went cleaving through an empty space.\nThen Gaznak replaced his head upon his neck, and all the while\nfought nimbly with his sword; and again and again Leothric swept\nwith Sacnoth at Gaznak's bearded neck, and ever the left hand of\nGaznak was quicker than the stroke, and the head went up and the\nsword rushed vainly under it.\n\nAnd the ringing fight went on till Leothric's armour lay all round\nhim on the floor and the marble was splashed with his blood, and the\nsword of Gaznak was notched like a saw from meeting the blade of\nSacnoth.  Still Gaznak stood unwounded and smiling still.\n\nAt last Leothric looked at the throat of Gaznak and aimed with\nSacnoth, and again Gaznak lifted his head by the hair; but not at\nhis throat flew Sacnoth, for Leothric struck instead at the lifted\nhand, and through the wrist of it went Sacnoth whirring, as a scythe\ngoes through the stem of a single flower.\n\nAnd bleeding, the severed hand fell to the floor; and at once blood\nspurted from the shoulders of Gaznak and dripped from the fallen\nhead, and the tall pinnacles went down into the earth, and the wide\nfair terraces all rolled away, and the court was gone like the dew,\nand a wind came and the colonnades drifted thence, and all the\ncolossal halls of Gaznak fell.  And the abysses closed up suddenly as\nthe mouth of a man who, having told a tale, will for ever speak no\nmore.\n\nThen Leothric looked around him in the marshes where the night mist\nwas passing away, and there was no fortress nor sound of dragon or\nmortal, only beside him lay an old man, wizened and evil and dead,\nwhose head and hand were severed from his body.\n\nAnd gradually over the wide lands the dawn was coming up, and ever\ngrowing in beauty as it came, like to the peal of an organ played by\na master's hand, growing louder and lovelier as the soul of the\nmaster warms, and at last giving praise with all its mighty voice.\n\nThen the birds sang, and Leothric went homeward, and left the\nmarshes and came to the dark wood, and the light of the dawn\nascending lit him upon his way.  And into Allathurion he came ere\nnoon, and with him brought the evil wizened head, and the people\nrejoiced, and their nights of trouble ceased.\n\n    *   *   *   *   *   *   *\n\nThis is the tale of the vanquishing of The Fortress Unvanquishable,\nSave For Sacnoth, and of its passing away, as it is told and\nbelieved by those who love the mystic days of old.\n\nOthers have said, and vainly claim to prove, that a fever came to\nAllathurion, and went away; and that this same fever drove Leothric\ninto the marshes by night, and made him dream there and act\nviolently with a sword.\n\nAnd others again say that there hath been no town of Allathurion,\nand that Leothric never lived.\n\nPeace to them.  The gardener hath gathered up this autumn's leaves.\nWho shall see them again, or who wot of them? And who shall say what\nhath befallen in the days of long ago?\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord of Cities\n\nI came one day upon a road that wandered so aimlessly that it was\nsuited to my mood, so I followed it, and it led me presently among\ndeep woods.  Somewhere in the midst of them Autumn held his court,\nsitting wreathed with gorgeous garlands; and it was the day before\nhis annual festival of the Dance of Leaves, the courtly festival\nupon which hungry Winter rushes mob-like, and there arise the\nfurious cries of the North Wind triumphing, and all the splendour\nand grace of the woods is gone, and Autumn flees away, discrowned\nand forgotten, and never again returns.  Other Autumns arise, other\nAutumns, and fall before other Winters.  A road led away to the left,\nbut my road went straight on.  The road to the left had a trodden\nappearance; there were wheel tracks on it, and it seemed the correct\nway to take.  It looked as if no one could have any business with the\nroad that led straight on and up the hill.  Therefore I went straight\non and up the hill; and here and there on the road grew blades of\ngrass undisturbed in the repose and hush that the road had earned\nfrom going up and down the world; for you can go by this road, as\nyou can go by all roads, to London, to Lincoln, to the North of\nScotland, to the West of Wales, and to Wrellisford where roads end.\nPresently the woods ended, and I came to the open fields and at the\nsame moment to the top of the hill, and saw the high places of\nSomerset and the downs of Wilts spread out along the horizon.\nSuddenly I saw underneath me the village of Wrellisford, with no\nsound in its street but the voice of the Wrellis roaring as he\ntumbled over a weir above the village.  So I followed my road down\nover the crest of the hill, and the road became more languid as I\ndescended, and less and less concerned with the cares of a highway.\nHere a spring broke out in the middle of it, and here another. The\nroad never heeded.  A stream ran right across it, still it straggled\non.  Suddenly it gave up the minimum property that a road should\npossess, and, renouncing its connection with High Streets, its\nlineage of Piccadilly, shrank to one side and became an\nunpretentious footpath.  Then it led me to the old bridge over the\nstream, and thus I came to Wrellisford, and found after travelling\nin many lands a village with no wheel tracks in its street.  On the\nother side of the bridge, my friend the road struggled a few yards\nup a grassy slope, and there ceased.  Over all the village hung a\ngreat stillness, with the roar of the Wrellis cutting right across\nit, and there came occasionally the bark of a dog that kept watch\nover the broken stillness and over the sanctity of that untravelled\nroad.  That terrible and wasting fever that, unlike so many plagues,\ncomes not from the East but from the West, the fever of hurry, had\nnot come here--only the Wrellis hurried on his eternal quest, but it\nwas a calm and placid hurry that gave one time for song.  It was in\nthe early afternoon, and nobody was about.  Either they worked beyond\nthe mysterious valley that nursed Wrellisford and hid it from the\nworld, or else they secluded themselves within their old-time houses\nthat were roofed with tiles of stone.  I sat down upon the old stone\nbridge and watched the Wrellis, who seemed to me to be the only\ntraveller that came from far away into this village where roads end,\nand passed on beyond it.  And yet the Wrellis comes singing out of\neternity, and tarries for a very little while in the village where\nroads end, and passes on into eternity again; and so surely do all\nthat dwell in Wrellisford.  I wondered as I leaned upon the bridge in\nwhat place the Wrellis would first find the sea, whether as he\nwound idly through meadows on his long quest he would suddenly\nbehold him, and, leaping down over some rocky cliff, take to him at\nonce the message of the hills.  Or whether, widening slowly into some\ngrand and tidal estuary, he would take his waste of waters to\nthe sea and the might of the river should meet with the might of the\nwaves, like to two Emperors clad in gleaming mail meeting midway\nbetween two hosts of war; and the little Wrellis would become a\nhaven for returning ships and a setting-out place for adventurous\nmen.\n\nA little beyond the bridge there stood an old mill with a ruined\nroof, and a small branch of the Wrellis rushed through its emptiness\nshouting, like a boy playing alone in a corridor of some desolate\nhouse.  The mill-wheel was gone, but there lay there still great bars\nand wheels and cogs, the bones of some dead industry.  I know not\nwhat industry was once lord in that house, I know not what retinue\nof workers mourns him now; I only know who is lord there today in\nall those empty chambers.  For as soon as I entered, I saw a whole\nwall draped with his marvellous black tapestry, without price\nbecause inimitable and too delicate to pass from hand to hand among\nmerchants.  I looked at the wonderful complexity of its infinite\nthreads, my finger sank into it for more than an inch without\nfeeling the touch; so black it was and so carefully wrought,\nsombrely covering the whole of the wall, that it might have been\nworked to commemorate the deaths of all that ever lived there, as\nindeed it was.  I looked through a hole in the wall into an inner\nchamber where a worn-out driving band went among many wheels, and\nthere this priceless inimitable stuff not merely clothed the walls\nbut hung from bars and ceiling in beautiful draperies, in marvellous\nfestoons.  Nothing was ugly in this desolate house, for the busy\nartist's soul of its present lord had beautified everything in its\ndesolation.  It was the unmistakable work of the spider, in whose\nhouse I was, and the house was utterly desolate but for him, and\nsilent but for the roar of the Wrellis and the shout of the little\nstream.  Then I turned homewards; and as I went up and over the hill\nand lost the sight of the village, I saw the road whiten and harden\nand gradually broaden out till the tracks of wheels appeared; and it\nwent afar to take the young men of Wrellisford into the wide ways of\nthe earth--to the new West and the mysterious East, and into the\ntroubled South.\n\nAnd that night, when the house was still and sleep\nwas far off, hushing hamlets and giving ease to cities, my fancy\nwandered up that aimless road and came suddenly to Wrellisford.  And\nit seemed to me that the travelling of so many people for so many\nyears between Wrellisford and John o' Groat's, talking to one\nanother as they went or muttering alone, had given the road a voice.\nAnd it seemed to me that night that the road spoke to the river by\nWrellisford bridge, speaking with the voice of many pilgrims.  And\nthe road said to the river: 'I rest here.  How is it with you?'\n\nAnd the river, who is always speaking, said: 'I rest nowhere from\ndoing the Work of the World.  I carry the murmur of inner lands to\nthe sea, and to the abysses voices of the hills.'\n\n'It is I,' said the road, 'that do the Work of the World, and take\nfrom city to city the rumour of each.  There is nothing higher than\nMan and the making of cities.  What do you do for Man?'\n\nAnd the river said: 'Beauty and song are higher than Man.  I carry\nthe news seaward of the first song of the thrush after the furious\nretreat of winter northward, and the first timid anemone learns from\nme that she is safe and that spring has truly come.  Oh but the song\nof all the birds in spring is more beautiful than Man, and the first\ncoming of the hyacinth more delectable than his face!  When spring is\nfallen upon the days of summer, I carry away with mournful joy at\nnight petal by petal the rhododendron's bloom.  No lit procession of\npurple kings is nigh so fair as that.  No beautiful death of\nwell-beloved men hath such a glory of forlornness.  And I bear far\naway the pink and white petals of the apple-blossom's youth when the\nlaborious time comes for his work in the world and for the bearing\nof apples.  And I am robed each day and every night anew with the\nbeauty of heaven, and I make lovely visions of the trees.  But Man!\nWhat is Man? In the ancient parliament of the elder hills, when the\ngrey ones speak together, they say nought of Man, but concern\nthemselves only with their brethren the stars.  Or when they wrap\nthemselves in purple cloaks at evening, they lament some old\nirreparable wrong, or, uttering some mountain hymn, all mourn the\nset of sun.'\n\n'Your beauty,' said the road, 'and the beauty of the sky, and of the\nrhododendron blossom and of spring, live only in the mind of Man,\nand except in the mind of Man the mountains have no voices.  Nothing\nis beautiful that has not been seen by Man's eye.  Or if your\nrhododendron blossom was beautiful for a moment, it soon withered\nand was drowned, and spring soon passes away; beauty can only live\non in the mind of Man.  I bring thought into the mind of Man swiftly\nfrom distant places every day.  I know the Telegraph--I know him\nwell; he and I have walked for hundreds of miles together.  There is\nno work in the world except for Man and the making of his cities.  I\ntake wares to and fro from city to city.'\n\n'My little stream in the field there,' said the river, 'used to make\nwares in that house for awhile once.'\n\n'Ah,' said the road, 'I remember, but I brought cheaper ones from\ndistant cities.  Nothing is of any importance but making cities for\nMan.'\n\n'I know so little about him,' said the river, 'but I have a great\ndeal of work to do--I have all this water to send down to the sea;\nand then tomorrow or next day all the leaves of Autumn will be\ncoming this way.  It will be very beautiful.  The sea is a very, very\nwonderful place.  I know all about it; I have heard shepherd boys\nsinging of it, and sometimes before a storm the gulls come up.  It is\na place all blue and shining and full of pearls, and has in it coral\nislands and isles of spice, and storms and galleons and the bones of\nDrake.  The sea is much greater than Man.  When I come to the sea, he\nwill know that I have worked well for him.  But I must hurry, for I\nhave much to do.  This bridge delays me a little; some day I will\ncarry it away.'\n\n'Oh, you must not do that,' said the road.\n\n'Oh, not for a long time,' said the river.  'Some centuries\nperhaps--and I have much to do besides.  There is my song to sing, for\ninstance, and that alone is more beautiful than any noise that Man\nmakes.'\n\n'All work is for Man,' said the road, 'and for the building of\ncities.  There is no beauty or romance or mystery in the sea except\nfor the men that sail abroad upon it, and for those that stay at\nhome and dream of them.  As for your song, it rings night and\nmorning, year in, year out, in the ears of men that are born in\nWrellisford; at night it is part of their dreams, at morning it is\nthe voice of day, and so it becomes part of their souls.  But the\nsong is not beautiful in itself.  I take these men with your song in\ntheir souls up over the edge of the valley and a long way off\nbeyond, and I am a strong and dusty road up there, and they go with\nyour song in their souls and turn it into music and gladden cities.\nBut nothing is the Work of the World except work for Man.'\n\n'I wish I was quite sure about the Work of the World,' said the\nstream; 'I wish I knew for certain for whom we work.  I feel almost\nsure that it is for the sea.  He is very great and beautiful.  I think\nthat there can be no greater master than the sea.  I think that some\nday he may be so full of romance and mystery and sound of sheep\nbells and murmur of mist-hidden hills, which we streams shall have\nbrought him, that there will be no more music or beauty left in the\nworld, and all the world will end; and perhaps the streams shall\ngather at the last, we all together, to the sea.  Or perhaps the sea\nwill give us at the last unto each one his own again, giving back\nall that he has garnered in the years--the little petals of the\napple-blossom and the mourned ones of the rhododendron, and our old\nvisions of the trees and sky; so many memories have left the hills.\nBut who may say? For who knows the tides of the sea?'\n\n'Be sure that it is all for Man,' said the road.  'For Man and the\nmaking of cities.'\n\nSomething had come near on utterly silent feet.\n\n'Peace, peace!' it said.  'You disturb the queenly night, who, having\ncome into this valley, is a guest in my dark halls.  Let us have an\nend to this discussion.'\n\nIt was the spider who spoke.\n\n'The Work of the World is the making of cities and palaces.  But it\nis not for Man.  What is Man? He only prepares my cities for me, and\nmellows them.  All his works are ugly, his richest tapestries are\ncoarse and clumsy.  He is a noisy idler.  He only protects me from\nmine enemy the wind; and the beautiful work in my cities, the\ncurving outlines and the delicate weavings, is all mine.  Ten years\nto a hundred it takes to build a city, for five or six hundred more\nit mellows, and is prepared for me; then I inhabit it, and hide away\nall that is ugly, and draw beautiful lines about it to and fro.\nThere is nothing so beautiful as cities and palaces; they are the\nloveliest places in the world, because they are the stillest, and so\nmost like the stars.  They are noisy at first, for a little, before I\ncome to them; they have ugly corners not yet rounded off, and coarse\ntapestries, and then they become ready for me and my exquisite work,\nand are quite silent and beautiful.  And there I entertain the regal\nnights when they come there jewelled with stars, and all their train\nof silence, and regale them with costly dust.  Already nods, in a\ncity that I wot of, a lonely sentinel whose lords are dead, who\ngrows too old and sleepy to drive away the gathering silence that\ninfests the streets; tomorrow I go to see if he be still at his\npost.  For me Babylon was built, and rocky Tyre; and still men build\nmy cities!  All the Work of the World is the making of cities, and\nall of them I inherit.'\n\n\n\n\nThe Doom of La Traviata\n\nEvening stole up out of mysterious lands and came down on the\nstreets of Paris, and the things of the day withdrew themselves and\nhid away, and the beautiful city was strangely altered, and with it\nthe hearts of men.  And with lights and music, and in silence and in\nthe dark, the other life arose, the life that knows the night, and\ndark cats crept from the houses and moved to silent places, and dim\nstreets became haunted with dusk shapes.  At this hour in a mean\nhouse, near to the Moulin Rouge, La Traviata died; and her death was\nbrought to her by her own sins, and not by the years of God.  But the\nsoul of La Traviata drifted blindly about the streets where she had\nsinned till it struck against the wall of Notre Dame de Paris.\nThence it rushed upwards, as the sea mist when it beats against a\ncliff, and streamed away to Paradise, and was there judged.  And it\nseemed to me, as I watched from my place of dreaming, when La\nTraviata came and stood before the seat of judgment, that clouds\ncame rushing up from the far Paradisal hills and gathered together\nover the head of God, and became one black cloud; and the clouds\nmoved swiftly as shadows of the night when a lantern is swung in the\nhand, and more and more clouds rushed up, and ever more and more,\nand, as they gathered, the cloud a little above the head of God\nbecame no larger, but only grew blacker and blacker.  And the halos\nof the saints settled lower upon their heads and narrowed and became\npale, and the singing of the choirs of the seraphim faltered and\nsunk low, and the converse of the blessed suddenly ceased.  Then a\nstern look came into the face of God, so that the seraphim turned\naway and left Him, and the saints.  Then God commanded, and seven\ngreat angels rose up slowly through the clouds that carpet Paradise,\nand there was pity on their faces, and their eyes were closed.  Then\nGod pronounced judgment, and the lights of Paradise went out, and\nthe azure crystal windows that look towards the world, and the\nwindows rouge and verd, became dark and colourless, and I saw no\nmore.  Presently the seven great angels came out by one of Heaven's\ngates and set their faces Hellwards, and four of them carried the\nyoung soul of La Traviata, and one of them went on before and one of\nthem followed behind.  These six trod with mighty strides the long and\ndusty road that is named the Way of the Damned.  But the seventh flew\nabove them all the way, and the light of the fires of Hell that was\nhidden from the six by the dust of that dreadful road flared on the\nfeathers of his breast.\n\nPresently the seven angels, as they swept Hellwards, uttered speech.\n\n'She is very young,' they said; and 'She is very beautiful,' they\nsaid; and they looked long at the soul of La Traviata, looking not\nat the stains of sin, but at that portion of her soul wherewith she\nhad loved her sister a long while dead, who flitted now about an\norchard on one of Heaven's hills with a low sunlight ever on her\nface, who communed daily with the saints when they passed that way\ngoing to bless the dead from Heaven's utmost edge.  And as they\nlooked long at the beauty of all that remained beautiful in her soul\nthey said: 'It is but a young soul;' and they would have taken her\nto one of Heaven's hills, and would there have given her a cymbal\nand a dulcimer, but they knew that the Paradisal gates were clamped\nand barred against La Traviata.  And they would have taken her to a\nvalley in the world where there were a great many flowers and a loud\nsound of streams, where birds were singing always and church bells\nrang on Sabbaths, only this they durst not do.  So they swept onwards\nnearer and nearer Hell.  But when they were come quite close and the\nglare was on their faces, and they saw the gates already divide and\nprepare to open outwards, they said: 'Hell is a terrible city, and\nshe is tired of cities;' then suddenly they dropped her by the side\nof the road, and wheeled and flew away.  But into a great pink flower\nthat was horrible and lovely grew the soul of La Traviata; and it\nhad in it two eyes but no eyelids, and it stared constantly into the\nfaces of all the passers-by that went along the dusty road to Hell;\nand the flower grew in the glare of the lights of Hell, and withered\nbut could not die; only, one petal turned back towards the heavenly\nhills as an ivy leaf turns outwards to the day, and in the soft and\nsilvery light of Paradise it withered not nor faded, but heard at\ntimes the commune of the saints coming murmuring from the distance,\nand sometimes caught the scent of orchards wafted from the heavenly\nhills, and felt a faint breeze cool it every evening at the hour\nwhen the saints to Heaven's edge went forth to bless the dead.\n\nBut the Lord arose with His sword, and scattered His disobedient\nangels as a thresher scatters chaff.\n\n\n\n\nOn The Dry Land\n\nOver the marshes hung the gorgeous night with all his wandering\nbands of nomad stars, and his whole host of still ones blinked and\nwatched.\n\nOver the safe dry land to eastward, grey and cold, the first clear\npallor of dawn was coming up above the heads of the immortal gods.\n\nThen, as they neared at last the safety of the dry land, Love looked\nat the man whom he had led for so long through the marshes, and saw\nthat his hair was white, for it was shining in the pallor of the\ndawn.\n\nThen they stepped together on to the land, and the old man sat down\nweary on the grass, for they had wandered in the marshes for many\nyears; and the light of the grey dawn widened above the heads of the\ngods.\n\nAnd Love said to the old man, 'I will leave you now.'\n\nAnd the old man made no answer, but wept softly.\n\nThen Love was grieved in his little careless heart, and he said:\n'You must not be sorry that I go, nor yet regret me, nor care for me\nat all.\n\n'I am a very foolish child, and was never kind to you, nor friendly.\nI never cared for your great thoughts, or for what was good in you,\nbut perplexed you by leading you up and down the perilous marshes.\nAnd I was so heartless that, had you perished where I led you, it\nwould have been nought to me, and I only stayed with you because you\nwere good to play with.\n\n'And I am cruel and altogether worthless and not such a one as any\nshould be sorry for when I go, or one to be regretted, or even cared\nfor at all.'\n\nAnd still the old man spoke not, but wept softly; and Love grieved\nbitterly in his kindly heart.\n\nAnd Love said: 'Because I am so small my strength has been concealed\nfrom you, and the evil that I have done.  But my strength is great,\nand I have used it unjustly.  Often I pushed you from the causeway\nthrough the marshes, and cared not if you drowned.  Often I mocked\nyou, and caused others to mock you.  And often I led you among those\nthat hated me, and laughed when they revenged themselves upon you.\n\n'So weep not, for there is no kindness in my heart, but only murder\nand foolishness, and I am no companion for one so wise as you, but\nam so frivolous and silly that I laughed at your noble dreams and\nhindered all your deeds.  See now, you have found me out, and now you\nwill send me away, and here you will live at ease, and, undisturbed,\nhave noble dreams of the immortal gods.\n\n'See now, here is dawn and safety, and _there_ is darkness and peril.'\n\nStill the old man wept softly.\n\nThen Love said: 'Is it thus with you?' and his voice was grave now\nand quiet.  'Are you so troubled?  Old friend of so many years, there\nis grief in my heart for you.  Old friend of perilous ventures, I\nmust leave you now.  But I will send my brother soon to you--my\nlittle brother Death.  And he will come up out of the marshes to you,\nand will not forsake you, but will be true to you as I have not been\ntrue.'\n\nAnd dawn grew brighter over the immortal gods, and the old man\nsmiled through his tears, which glistened wondrously in the\nincreasing light.  But Love went down to the night and to the\nmarshes, looking backward over his shoulder as he went, and smiling\nbeautifully about his eyes.  And in the marshes whereunto he went, in\nthe midst of the gorgeous night, and under the wandering bands of\nnomad stars, rose shouts of laughter and the sounds of the dance.\n\nAnd after a while, with his face towards the morning, Death out of\nthe marshes came up tall and beautiful, and with a faint smile\nshadowy on his lips, and lifted in his arms the lonely man, being\ngentle with him, and, murmuring with his low deep voice an ancient\nsong, carried him to the morning to the gods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories\nby Lord Dunsany\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SWORD OF WELLERAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10806-8.txt or 10806-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/8/0/10806/\n\nProduced by Tom Harris\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
