These addressed to\n     his homeland, refer to the Westerners in London as\n     barbarians and many of the aids to life in our society give\n     Kong Ho endless food for thought. These are things such as\n     the motor car and the piano; unknown in China at this time.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nESTIMABLE BARBARIAN,--Your opportune suggestion that I should permit the\nletters, wherein I have described with undeviating fidelity the customs\nand manner of behaving of your accomplished race, to be set forth in\nthe form of printed leaves for all to behold, is doubtless\ngracefully-intentioned, and this person will raise no barrier of dissent\nagainst it.\n\nIn this he is inspired by the benevolent hope that his immature\ncompositions may to one extent become a model and a by-word to those who\nin turn visit his own land of Fragrant Purity; for with exacting care\nhe has set down no detail that has not come under his direct observation\n(although it is not to be denied that here or there he may, perchance,\nhave misunderstood an involved allusion or failed to grasp the inner\nsignificance of an act), so that Impartiality necessarily sways his\nbrush, and Truth lurks within his inkpot.\n\nIn an entirely contrary manner some, who of recent years have gratified\nus with their magnanimous presence, have returned to their own countries\nnot only with the internal fittings of many of our palaces (which,\nbeing for the most part of a replaceable nature, need be only trivially\nreferred to, the incident, indeed, being generally regarded as a most\ncordial and pressing variety of foreign politeness), but also--in\nthe lack of highly-spiced actuality--with subtly-imagined and truly\nobjectionable instances. These calumnies they have not hesitated to\ncommit to the form of printed books, which, falling into the hands\nof the ignorant and undiscriminating, may even suggest to their\nill-balanced minds a doubt whether we of the Celestial Empire really are\nthe wisest, bravest, purest, and most enlightened people in existence.\n\nAs a parting, it only remains to be said that, in order to maintain\nunimpaired the quaint-sounding brevity and archaic construction of your\nprepossessing language, I have engraved most of the remarks upon the\nreceptive tablets of my mind as they were uttered. To one who can repeat\nthe Five Classics without stumbling this is a contemptible achievement.\nLet it be an imposed obligation, therefore, that you retain these\nportions unchanged as a test and a proof to all who may read. Of my\nown deficient words, I can only in truest courtesy maintain that any\nalteration must of necessity make them less offensively commonplace than\nat present they are.\n\nThe Sign and immutable Thumb-mark of, Kong Ho\n\nBy a sure hand to the House of one Ernest Bramah.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MIRROR OF KONG HO\n\n\n\n\nLETTER I\n\n\n Concerning the journey. The unlawful demons invoked by\n certain of the barbarians; their power and the manner of\n their suppression. Suppression. The incredible obtuseness of\n those who attend within tea-houses. The harmonious attitude\n of a person of commerce.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE (at whose virtuous and well-established feet an unworthy\nson now prostrates himself in spirit repeatedly),--\n\nHaving at length reached the summit of my journey, that London of which\nthe merchants from Canton spoke so many strange and incredible things, I\nnow send you filial salutations three times increased, and in accordance\nwith your explicit command I shall write all things to you with an\nunvarnished brush, well assured that your versatile object in committing\nme to so questionable an enterprise was, above all, to learn the\ntruth of these matters in an undeviating and yet open-headed spirit of\naccuracy and toleration.\n\nOf the perils incurred while travelling in the awe-inspiring devices by\nwhich I was transferred from shore to shore and yet further inland,\nof the utter absence of all leisurely dignity on the part of\nthose controlling their movements, and of the almost unnatural\nself-opinionatedness which led them to persist in starting at a stated\nand prearranged time, even when this person had courteously pointed\nout to them by irrefutable omens that neither the day nor the hour was\nsuitable for the venture, I have already written. It is enough to assert\nthat a similar want of prudence was maintained on every occasion, and,\nas a result, when actually within sight of the walls of this city, we\nwere involved for upwards of an hour in a very evilly-arranged yellow\ndarkness, which, had we but delayed for a day, as I strenuously advised\nthose in authority after consulting the Sacred Flat and Round Sticks, we\nshould certainly have avoided.\n\nConcerning the real nature of the devices by which the ships are\npropelled at sea and the carriages on land, I must still unroll a blank\nmind until I can secretly, and without undue hazard, examine them more\nclosely. If, as you maintain, it is the work of captive demons hidden\naway among their most inside parts, it must be admitted that these\nusually intractable beings are admirably trained and controlled, and\nI am wide-headed enough to think that in this respect we\nmight--not-withstanding our nine thousand years of civilised\nrefinement--learn something of the methods of these barbarians. The\nsecret, however, is jealously guarded, and they deny the existence of\nany supernatural forces; but their protests may be ignored, for there\nis undoubtedly a powerful demon used in a similar way by some of the\nboldest of them, although its employment is unlawful. A certain kind of\nchariot is used for the occupation of this demon, and those who wish\nto invoke it conceal their faces within masks of terrifying design, and\ncover their hands and bodies with specially prepared garments, without\nwhich it would be fatal to encounter these very powerful spirits.\nWhile yet among the habitations of men, and in crowded places, they are\nconstrained to use less powerful demons, which are lawful, but when\nthey reach the unfrequented paths they throw aside all restraint, and,\ncalling to their aid the forbidden spirit (which they do by secret\nmovements of the hands), they are carried forward by its agency at a\nspeed unattainable by merely human means. By day the demon looks forth\nfrom three white eyes, which at night have a penetrating brilliance\nequal to the fiercest glances of the Sacred Dragon in anger. If any\nperson incautiously stands in its way it utters a warning cry of\nintolerable rage, and should the presumptuous one neglect to escape to\nthe roadside and there prostrate himself reverentially before it, it\nseizes him by the body part and contemptuously hurls him bruised and\nunrecognisable into the boundless space of the around. Frequently\nthe demon causes the chariot to rise into the air, and it is credibly\nasserted by discriminating witnesses (although this person only sets\ndown as incapable of denial that which he has actually beheld) that\nsome have maintained an unceasing flight through the middle air for a\ndistance of many li. Occasionally the captive demon escapes from the\nbondage of those who have invoked it, through some incautious gesture\nor heretical remark on their part, and then it never fails to use them\ngrievously, casting them to the ground wounded, consuming the chariot\nwith fire, and passing away in the midst of an exceedingly debased\nodour, by which it is always accompanied after the manner of our own\nearth spirits.\n\nThis being, as this person has already set forth, an unlawful demon on\naccount of its power when once called up, and the admitted uncertainty\nof its movements, those in authority maintain a stern and inexorable\nface towards the practice. To entrap the unwary certain persons (chosen\non account of their massive outlines, and further protected from evil\ninfluences by their pure and consistent habits) keep an unceasing watch.\nWhen one of them, himself lying concealed, detects the approach of such\na being, he closely observes the position of the sun, and signals to\nthe other a message of warning. Then the second one, shielded by the\nsanctity of his life and rendered inviolable by the nature of his\ngarments--his sandals alone being capable of overturning any demon from\nhis path should it encounter them--boldly steps forth into the road and\nholds out before him certain sacred emblems. So powerful are these\nthat at the sight the unlawful demon confesses itself vanquished, and\nalthough its whole body trembles with ill-contained rage, and the air\naround is poisoned by its discreditable exhalation, it is devoid of\nfurther resistance. Those in the chariot are thereupon commanded to\ndismiss it, and being bound in chains they are led into the presence of\ncertain lesser mandarins who administer justice from a raised dais.\n\n\"Behold!\" exclaims the chief of the captors, when the prisoners have\nbeen placed in obsequious attitudes before the lesser mandarins, \"thus\nthe matter chanced: The honourable Wang, although disguised under the\nsemblance of an applewoman, had discreetly concealed himself by the\nroadside, all but his head being underneath a stream of stagnant water,\nwhen, at the eighth hour of the morning, he beheld these repulsive\noutcasts approaching in their chariot, carried forward by the diabolical\nvigour of the unlawful demon. Although I had stationed myself several li\ndistant from the accomplished Wang, the chariot reached me in less than\na breathing space of time, those inside assuming their fiercest and most\naggressive attitudes, and as they came repeatedly urging the demon to\nincreased exertions. Their speed exceeded that of the swallow in\nhis hymeneal flight, all shrubs and flowers by the wayside withered\nincapably at the demon's contaminating glance, running water ceased\nto flow, and the road itself was scorched at their passage, the earth\nemitting a dull bluish flame. These facts, and the times and the\ndistances, this person has further inscribed in a book which thus\ndisposes of all possible defence. Therefore, O lesser mandarins, let\njustice be accomplished heavily and without delay; for, as the proverb\ntruly says, 'The fiercer the flame the more useless the struggles of the\nvictim.'\"\n\nAt this point the prisoners frequently endeavour to make themselves\nheard, protesting that in the distance between the concealed Wang and\nthe one who stands accusing them they had thrice stopped to repair their\ninnermost details, had leisurely partaken of food and wine, and had\nalso been overtaken, struck, and delayed by a funeral procession. But so\ngreat is the execration in which these persons are held, that although\nmurderers by stealth, outlaws, snatchers from the body, and companies of\nmen who by strategy make a smaller sum of money appear to be larger, can\nall freely testify their innocence, raisers of this unlawful demon\nmust not do so, and they are beaten on the head with chains until they\ndesist.\n\nThen the lesser mandarins, raising their voices in unison, exclaim,\n\"The amiable Tsay-hi has reported the matter in a discreet and impartial\nspirit. Hear our pronouncement: These raisers of illegal spirits\nshall each contribute ten taels of gold, which shall be expended in\njoss-sticks, in purifying the road which they have scorched, and in\nalleviating the distress of the poor and virtuous of both sexes. The\npraiseworthy Tsay-hi, moreover, shall embroider upon his sleeve an\nhonourable sign in remembrance of the event. Let drums now be beat, and\nour verdict loudly proclaimed throughout the province.\"\n\nThese things, O my illustrious father (although on account of my\ncontemptible deficiencies of style much may seem improbable to your\nall-knowing mind), these things I write with an unbending brush; for\nI set down only that which I have myself seen, or read in their own\nprinted records. Doubtless it will occur to one of your preternatural\nintelligence that our own system of administering justice, whereby the\nperson who can hire the greater number of witnesses is reasonably held\nto be in the right, although perhaps not absolutely infallible, is in\nevery way more convenient; but, as it is well said, \"To the blind, night\nis as acceptable as day.\"\n\nHenceforth you will have no hesitation in letting it be known throughout\nYuen-ping that these foreign barbarians do possess secret demons, in\nspite of their denials. Doubtless I shall presently discover others no\nless powerful.\n\nWith honourable distinction this person has at length grasped the\nessential details of the spoken language here--not sufficiently well,\nindeed, to make himself understood on most occasions, or even to\nunderstand others, but enough to perceive clearly when he fails to\nbecome intelligible or when they experience a like difficulty with him.\nUpon an earlier occasion, before he had made so much progress, being one\nday left to his own resources, and feeling an internal lack, he entered\nwhat appeared to be a tea-shop of reputable demeanour, and, seating\nhimself at one of the little marble tables, he freely pronounced the\ncarefully-learned word \"rice\" to the attending nymph. To put aside all\ndetails of preparation (into which, indeed, this person could not\nenter) he waved his hand gracefully, at the same time smiling with an\nexpression of tolerant acquiescence, as of one who would say that what\nwas good enough to be cooked and offered by so entrancing a maiden\nwas good enough to be eaten by him. After remaining in unruffled\ntranquillity for the full portion of an hour, and observing that no\nother person around had to wait above half that period, this one began\nto perceive that the enterprise was not likely to terminate in a\nmanner satisfactory to himself; so that, leaving this place with a few\nwell-chosen phrases of intolerable regret in his own tongue, he entered\nanother, and conducted himself in a like fashion.... Towards evening,\nwith an unperturbed exterior, but materially afflicted elsewhere, this\nperson seated himself within the eleventh tea-shop, and, pointing first\ntowards his own constituents of digestion, then at the fire, and\nlastly in an upward direction, thereby signified to any not of stunted\nintellect that he had reached such a condition of mind and body that he\nwas ready to consume whatever the ruling deities were willing to allot,\nwhether boiled, baked, roast, or suspended from a skewer. In this\nresolve nothing would move him, until--after many maidens had approached\nwith outstretched hands and gestures of despair--there presently entered\na person wearing the helmet of a warrior and the manner of a high\nofficial, who spoke strongly, yet persuasively, of the virtues of\nimmediate movement and a quiet and reposeful bearing.\n\nAssuredly a people who devote so little attention to the study of food,\nand all matters connected with it, must inevitably remain barbaric,\nhowever skilfully they may feign a superficial refinement. It is said,\nalthough I do not commit this matter to my own brush, that among them\nare more books composed on subjects which have no actual existence\nthan on cooking, and, incredible as it may appear, to be exceptionally\nround-bodied confers no public honour upon the individual. Should a\nfavourable occasion present itself, there are many who do not scruple to\njest upon the subject of food, or, what is incalculably more depraved,\nupon the scarcity of it.\n\nNevertheless, there are exceptions of a highly distinguished radiance.\nAmong these must be accounted one into whose presence this person was\nrecently led by our polished and harmonious friend Quang-Tsun, the\nmerchant in tea and spices. This versatile person, whose business-name\nis spoken of as Jones Bob-Jones, is worthy of all benignant respect,\nand in a really enlightened country would doubtless be raised to a\nmore exalted position than that of a breaker of outsides (an occupation\ndifficult to express adequately in the written language of a country\nwhere it is unknown), for his face is like the sun setting in the time\nof harvest, his waist garment excessive, and the undoubted symmetry of\nhis middle portions honourable in the extreme. So welcome in my eyes,\nafter witnessing an unending stream of concave and attenuated barbarian\nghosts, was the sight of these perfections of Jones Bob-Jones, that\ninstead of the formal greeting of this Island--the unmeaning \"How do\nyou do it?\"--I shook hands cordially with myself, and exclaimed\naffectionately in our own language, \"Illimitable felicities! How is your\nstomach?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Jones Bob-Jones, after Quang-Tsun had interpreted this\npolite salutation to his understanding, \"since you mention it, that's\njust the trouble; but I'm going on pretty well, thanks. I've tried most\nof the advertised things, and now my doctor has put me practically on a\nbread-and-water course--clear soup, boiled fish, plain joint, no sweets,\na crumb of cheese, and a bare three glasses of Hermitage.\"\n\nDuring this amiable remark (of which, as it is somewhat of a technical\nnature, I was unable to grasp the contained significance until the\nagreeable Quang-Tsun had subsequently repeated it several times for my\nretention), I maintained a consistent expression of harmonious agreement\nand gratified esteem (suitable, I find, for all like occasions), and\nthen, judging from the sympathetic animation of Jones Bob-Jones's\ncountenance, that it had not improbably been connected with food,\nI discreetly introduced the subject of sea-snails, preserved in the\nessence of crushed peaches, by courteously inquiring whether he had ever\npartaken of such a delicacy.\n\n\"No,\" replied the liberal-minded person, when--encouraged by the\nprotruding eagerness of his eyes at the mention of the viand--I had\nfurther spoken of the refined flavour of the dish, and explained the\nmanner of its preparation. \"I can't say that I have, but it sounds\nuncommonly good--something like turtle, I should imagine. I'll see if\nthey can get it for me at Pimm's.\"\n\nThis filial tribute goes by a trusty hand, in the person of one Ki Nihy,\nwho is shortly committing himself to the protection of his ancestors\nand the voracity of the unbounded Bitter Waters; and with brightness\nand gold it will doubtless reach you in the course of twelve or eighteen\nmoons. The superstitious here, this person may describe, when they wish\nto send messages from one to another, inscribe upon the outer cover a\nwritten representation of the one whose habitation they require, and\nafter affixing a small paper talisman, drop it into a hole in the\nnearest wall, in the hope that it may be ultimately conveyed to the\nappointed spot, either by the services of the charitably-disposed\npasser-by, or by the intervention of the beneficent deities.\n\nWith a multiplicity of greetings and many abject expressions of a\nconscious inferiority, and attested by an unvarying thumb-mark.\n\nKONG HO. (Effete branch of a pure and magnanimous trunk.)\n\n\nTo Kong Ah-Paik, reclining beneath the sign of the Lead Tortoise, in a\nnortherly direction beyond the Lotus Beds outside the city of Yuen-ping.\nThe Middle Flowery Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER II\n\n\n Concerning the ill-destined manner of existence of the hound\n Hercules. The thoughtlessly-expressed desire of the\n entrancing maiden and its effect upon a person of\n susceptible refinement. The opportune (as it may yet be\n described) visit of one Herbert. The behaviour of those\n around. Reflections.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE (whose large right hand is continuously floating in\nspirit over the image of this person's dutiful submission),--\n\nDoubtless to your all-consuming prescience, it will at once become plain\nthat I have abandoned the place of residence from which I directed my\nformer badly-written and offensively-constructed letter, the house of\nthe sympathetic and resourceful Maidens Blank, where in return for an\nutterly inadequate sum of money, produced at stated intervals, this very\nmuch inferior person was allowed to partake of a delicately-balanced and\nsomewhat unvarying fare in the company of the engaging of both sexes,\nand afterwards to associate on terms of honourable equality with them in\nthe chief apartment. The reason and manner of this one's departure\nare in no degree formidable to his refined manner of conducting any\nenterprise, but arose partly from an insufficient grasp of the more\nelaborate outlines of a confessedly involved language, and still more\nfrom a too excessive impetuousness in carrying out what at the time he\nbelieved to be the ambition of one who had come to exercise a melodious\ninfluence over his most internal emotions. Well remarked the Sage, \"A\npiece of gold may be tried between the teeth; a written promise to pay\nmay be disposed of at a sacrifice to one more credulous; but what shall\nbe said of the wind, the Hoang Ho, and the way of a woman?\"\n\nTo contrive a pitfall for this short-sighted person's immature feet,\ncertain malicious spirits had so willed it that the chief and more\nautumnal of the Maidens Blank (who, nevertheless, wore an excessively\nflower-like name), had long lavished herself upon the possession of an\nobtuse and self-assertive hound, which was in the habit of gratifying\nthis inconsiderable person and those who sat around by continually\ndepositing upon their unworthy garments details of its outer surface,\nand when the weather was more than usually cold, by stretching its\ngraceful and refined body before the fire in such a way as to ensure\nthat no one should suffer from a too acute exposure to the heat. From\nthese causes, and because it was by nature a hound which even on the\ndarkest night could be detected at a more than reasonable distance away,\nwhile at all times it did not hesitate to shake itself freely into\nthe various prepared viands, this person (and doubtless others also)\nregarded it with an emotion very unfavourable towards its prolonged\nexistence; but observing from the first that those who permitted\nthemselves to be deposited upon, and their hands and even their faces to\nbe hound-tongue-defiled with the most externally cheerful spirit of\nword suppression, invariably received the most desirable of the allotted\nportions of food, he judged it prudent and conducive to a settled\ndigestion to greet it with favourable terms and actions, and to refer\nfrequently to its well-displayed proportions, and to the agile dexterity\nwhich it certainly maintained in breathing into the contents of every\ndish. Thus the matter may be regarded as being positioned for a space of\ntime.\n\nOne evening I returned at the appointed gong-stroke of dinner, and was\nbeginning, according to my custom, to greet the hound with ingratiating\npoliteness, when the one of chief authority held up a reproving hand, at\nthe same time exclaiming:\n\n\"No, Mr. Kong, you must not encourage Hercules with your amiable\ncondescension, for just now he is in very bad odour with us all.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied this person, somewhat puzzled, nevertheless, that\nthe imperfection should thus be referred to openly by one who hitherto\nhad not hesitated to caress the hound with most intimate details,\n\"undoubtedly the surrounding has a highly concentrated acuteness\nto-night, but the ever-present characteristic of the hound Hercules is\nby no means new, for whenever he is in the room--\"\n\nAt this point it is necessary to explain that the ceremonial etiquette\nof these barbarian outcasts is both conflicting and involved. Upon\nmost of the ordinary occasions of life to obtrude oneself within the\nconversation of another is a thing not to be done, yet repeatedly when\nthis unpretentious person has been relating his experience or inquiring\ninto the nature and meaning of certain matters which he has witnessed,\nhe has become aware that his words have been obliterated, as it were,\nand his remarks diverted from their original intention by the sudden and\nunanticipated desire of those present to express themselves loudly on\nsome topic of not really engrossing interest. Not infrequently on such\noccasions every one present has spoken at once with concentrated anxiety\nupon the condition of the weather, the atmosphere of the room, the hour\nof the day, or some like detail of contemptible inferiority. At other\ntimes maidens of unquestionable politeness have sounded instruments of\nbrass or stringed woods with unceasing vigour, have cast down ornaments\nof china, or even stood upon each other's--or this person's--feet with\nassumed inelegance. When, therefore, in the midst of my agreeable remark\non the asserted no fragrance of the hound Hercules, a gentleman of\nhabitual refinement struck me somewhat heavily on the back of the head\nwith a reclining seat which he was conveying across the room for the\nacceptance of a lady, and immediately overwhelmed me with apologies\nof almost unnecessary profusion, my mind at once leapt to an inspired\nconclusion, and smiling acquiescently I bowed several times to each\nperson to convey to them an admission of the undoubted fact that to the\nwise a timely omen before the storm is as effective as a thunderbolt\nafterwards.\n\nIt chanced that there was present the exceptionally prepossessing maiden\nto whom this person has already referred. So varied and ornate were her\nattractions that it would be incompetent in one of my less than average\nability to attempt an adequate portrayal. She had a light-coloured name\nwith the letters so harmoniously convoluted as to be quite beyond my\ninferior power of pronunciation, so that if I wished to refer to her\nin her absence I had to indicate the one I meant by likening her to\na full-blown chrysanthemum, a piece of rare jade, an ivory pagoda of\nunapproachable antiquity, or some other object of admitted grace. Even\nthis description may scarcely convey to you the real extent of her\nelegant personality; but in her presence my internal organs never failed\nto vibrate with a most entrancing uncertainty, and even now, at the\nrecollection of her virtuous demeanour, I am by no means settled within\nmyself.\n\n\"Well,\" exclaimed this melodious vision, with sympathetic tact, \"if\nevery one is going to disown poor Hercules because he has eaten all our\ndinners, I shall be quite willing to have him, for he is a dzear ole\nloveykins, wasn't ums?\" (This, O my immaculate and dignified sire, which\nI transcribe with faithful undeviation, appears to be the dialect of\na remote province, spoken only by maidens--both young and of autumnal\nsolitude--under occasional mental stress; as of a native of Shan-si\nrelapsing without consciousness into his uncouth tongue after passing a\nlifetime in the Capital.) \"Don't you think so too, Mr. Kong?\"\n\n\"When the sun shines the shadow falls, for truly it is said, 'To the\nfaithful one even the voice of the corncrake at evening speaks of his\nabsent love,'\" replied this person, so engagingly disconcerted at\nbeing thus openly addressed by the maiden that he retained no delicate\nimpression of what she said, or even of what he was replying, beyond\nan unassuming hope that the nature of his feelings might perchance be\ninoffensively revealed to her in the semblance of a discreet allegory.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" interposed a person of neglected refinement, turning towards\nthe maiden, \"you would like to have a corncrake also, to remind you of\nMr. Kong?\"\n\n\"I do not know what a corncrake is like,\" replied the maiden with\ncommendable dignity. \"I do not think so, however, for I once had a pair\nof canaries, and I found them very unsatisfying, insipid creatures. But\nI should love to have a little dog I am sure, only Miss Blank won't hear\nof it.\"\n\n\"Kong Ho,\" thought this person inwardly, \"not in vain have you burnt\njoss sticks unceasingly, for the enchanting one has said into your\neyes that she would love to partake of a little dog. Assuredly we have\nrecently consumed the cold portion of sheep on more occasions than a\nstrict honourableness could require of those who pay a stated sum at\nregular intervals, and the change would be a welcome one. As she truly\nsays, the flavour even of canaries is trivial and insignificant by\ncomparison.\" During the period of dinner--which consisted of eggs and\ngreen herbs of the field--this person allowed the contemplation to grow\nwithin him, and inspired by a most pleasant and disinterested ambition\nto carry out the expressed wishes of the one who had spoken, he\ndetermined that the matter should be unobtrusively arranged despite the\nmercenary opposition of the Maidens Blank.\n\nThis person had already learned by experience that dogs are rarely if\never exposed for sale in the stalls of the meat venders, the reason\ndoubtless being that they are articles of excessive luxury and reserved\nby law for the rich and powerful. Those kept by private persons are\ngenerally closely guarded when they approach a desirable condition of\nbody, and the hound Hercules would not prove an attractive dish to those\nwho had known him in life. Nevertheless, it is well said, \"The Great\nWall is unsurmountable, but there are many gaps through,\" and that\nsame evening I was able to carry the first part of my well-intentioned\nsurprise into effect.\n\nThe matter now involves one named Herbert, who having exchanged gifts\nof betrothal with a maiden staying at the house, was in the habit of\npresenting himself openly, when he was permitted to see her, after the\nmanner of these barbarians. (Yet even of them the more discriminating\nacknowledge that our customs are immeasurably superior; for when I\nexplained to the aged father of the Maidens Blank that among us the\nmarriage rites are irrevocably performed before the bride is seen\nunveiled by man, he sighed heavily and exclaimed that the parents of\nthis country had much to learn.)\n\nThe genial-minded Herbert had already acquired for himself the\nreputation of being one who ceaselessly removes the gravity of others,\nboth by word and action, and from the first he selected this obscure\nperson for his charitable purpose to a most flattering extent. Not only\ndid he--on the pretext that his memory was rebellious--invariably greet\nme as \"Mr. Hong Kong,\" but on more than one occasion he insisted, with\nmirth-provoking reference to certain details of my unbecoming garments,\nthat I must surely have become confused and sent a Mrs. Hong Kong\ninstead of myself, and frequently he undermined the gravity of all most\nsuccessfully by pulling me backwards suddenly by the pigtail, with the\nplea that he imagined he was picking up his riding-whip. This attractive\nperson was always accompanied by a formidable dog--of convex limbs,\nshrunken lip, and suspicious demeanour--which he called Influenza, to\nthe excessive amusement of those to whom he related its characteristics.\nFor some inexplicable reason from the first it regarded my lower apparel\nas being unsuitable for the ordinary occasions of life, and in spite\nof the low hissing call by which its master endeavoured to attract\nits attention to himself, it devoted its energies unceasingly to the\nself-imposed task of removing them fragment by fragment. Nevertheless it\nwas a dog of favourable size and condition, and it need not therefore be\na matter for surprise that when the intellectual person Herbert took\nhis departure on the day in question it had to be assumed that it had\nalready preceded him. Having accomplished so much, this person found\nlittle difficulty in preparing it tastefully in his own apartment, and\nmaking the substitution on the following day.\n\nAlthough his mind was confessedly enlarged at the success of his\nventure, and his hopes most ornamentally coloured at the thought of the\nadorable one's gratified esteem when she discovered how expertly her\nwishes had been carried out, this person could not fail to notice that\nthe Maiden Blank was also materially agitated when she distributed the\ncontents of the dish before her.\n\n\"Will you, of your enlightened courtesy, accept, and overlook the\ndeficiencies of, a portion of rabbit-pie, O high-souled Mr. Kong?\" she\ninquired gracefully when this insignificant person was reached, and,\nconcealing my many-hued emotion beneath an impassive face, I bowed\nagreeably as I replied, \"To the beggar, black bread is a royal course.\"\n\n\"WHAT pie did you say, dear?\" whispered another autumnal maiden, when\nall had partaken somewhat, and at her words a most consistently acute\nsilence involved the table.\n\n\"I--I don't quite know,\" replied the one of the upper end, becoming\nexcessively devoid of complexion; and restraining her voice she\nforthwith sent down an attending slave to inquire closely.\n\nAt this point a person of degraded ancestry endeavoured to remove the\nundoubted cloud of depression by feigning the nocturnal cry of the\ndomestic cat; but in this he was not successful, and a maiden opposite,\nafter fixedly regarding a bone on her plate, withdrew suddenly,\nembracing herself as she went. A moment later the slave returned,\nproclaiming aloud that the dish which had been prepared for the occasion\nhad now been accidentally discovered by the round-bodied cook beneath\nthe cushions of an arm-chair (a spot by no means satisfactory to this\nperson's imagination had the opportunities at his disposal been more\ndiffuse).\n\n\"What, then, is this of which we have freely partaken?\" cried they\naround, and, in the really impressive silence which followed, an\ninopportune person discovered a small silver tablet among the fragments\nupon his plate, and, taking it up, read aloud the single word,\n\"Influenza.\"\n\nDuring the day, and even far into the uncounted gong-strokes of the\ntime of darkness, this person had frequently remained in a fascinated\ncontemplation of the moment when he should reveal himself and stand up\nto receive the benevolently-expressed congratulations of all who paid\nan agreed sum at fixed intervals, and, particularly, the dazzling though\nconfessedly unsettling glance-thanks of the celestially-formed maiden\nwho had explicitly stated that she was desirous of having a little\ndog. Now, however, when this part of the enterprise ought to have taken\nplace, I found myself unable to evade the conclusion that some important\ndetail of the entire scheme had failed to agree harmoniously with the\nrest, and, had it been possible, I would have retired with unobtrusive\ntact and permitted another to wear my honourable acquirements. But, for\nsome reason, as I looked around I perceived that every eye was fixed\nupon me with what at another time would have been a most engaging\nunanimity, and, although I bowed with undeterred profusion, and\nendeavoured to walk out behind an expression of all-comprehensive\nurbanity that had never hitherto failed me, a person of unsympathetic\noutline placed himself before the door, and two others, standing one\non each side of me, gave me to understand that a recital of the full\nhappening was required before I left the room.\n\nIt is hopeless to expect a display of refined intelligence at the hands\nof a people sunk in barbarism and unacquainted with the requirements of\ntrue dignity and the essentials of food preparation. On the manner\nof behaving of the male portion of those present this person has\nno inducement whatever to linger. Even the maiden for whom he had\naccomplished so much, after the nature of the misunderstanding had been\nmade plain to her, uttered only a single word of approval, which, on\nsubsequently consulting a book of interpretations, this person found to\nindicate: \"A person of weak intellect; one without an adequate sense of\nthe proportion and fitness of things; a buffoon; a jester; a compound of\ngooseberries scalded and crushed with cream\"; but although each of these\ndefinitions may in a way be regarded as applicable, he is still unable\nto decide which was the precise one intended.\n\nWith salutations of filial regard, and in a spirit seven times refined\nby affliction and purified by vain regrets.\n\nKONG HO. (Upon whose tablet posterity will perchance inscribe the\ntitles, \"Ill-destined but Misjudged.\")\n\n\n\n\nLETTER III\n\n\n Concerning the virtuous amusements of both old and young.\n The sit-round games. The masterpiece of the divine Li Tang,\n and its reception by all, including that same Herbert.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE (whose breadth of mind is so well developed as to take\nfor granted boundless filial professions, which, indeed, become vapid by\na too frequent reiteration),--\n\nYour amiable inquiry as to how the barbarians pass their time, when not\nemployed in affairs of commerce or in worshipping their ancestors, has\ninspired me to examine the matter more fully. At the same time your\npleasantly-composed aphorism that the interior nature of persons does\nnot vary with the colour of their eyes, and that if I searched I should\nfind the old flying kites and the younger kicking feather balls or\nworking embroidery, according to their sex, does not appear to be\naccurately sustained.\n\nThe lesser ones, it is true, engage in a variety of sumptuous\nhandicrafts, such as the scorching of wooden tablets with the semblance\nof a pattern, and gouging others with sharpened implements into a crude\nrelief; depicting birds and flowers upon the surface of plates, rending\nleather into shreds, and entwining beaten iron, brass, and copper into a\ndiversity of most ingenious complications; but when I asked a maiden of\naffectionate and domesticated appearance whether she had yet worked her\nage-stricken father's coffin-cloth, she said that the subject was one\nupon which she declined to jest, and rapidly involving herself in a\nprofuse display of emotion, she withdrew, leaving this one aghast.\n\nTo enable my mind to retranquillise, I approached a youth\nof highly-gilded appearance, and, with many predictions of\nself-inferiority, I suggested that we should engage in the stimulating\nrivalry of feather ball. When he learned, however, that the diversion\nconsisted in propelling upwards a feather-trimmed chip by striking it\nagainst the side of the foot, he candidly replied that he was afraid\nhe had grown out of shuttle-cock, but did not mind, if I was vigorously\ninclined, \"taking me on for a set of yang-pong.\"\n\nOld men here, it is said, do not fly kites, and they affect to despise\ncatching flies for amusement, although they frequently go fishing.\nStruck by this peculiarity, I put it in the form of an inquiry to one\nof venerable appearance, why, when at least five score flies were\nundeniably before his eyes, he preferred to recline for lengthy periods\nby the side of a stream endeavouring to snare creatures of whose\nexistence he himself had never as yet received any adequate proof.\nDoubtless in my contemptible ignorance, however, I used some word\ninaccurately, for those who stood around suffered themselves to become\namused, and the one in question replied with no pretence of amiable\ncondescension that the jest had already been better expressed a hundred\ntimes, and that I would find the behind parts of a printed leaf\ncalled \"Punch\" in the bookcase. Not being desirous of carrying on\na conversation of which I felt that I had misplaced the most highly\nrectified ingredient, I bowed repeatedly, and replied affably that\nwisdom ruled his left side and truth his right.\n\nIt was upon this same occasion that a young man of unprejudiced\nwide-mindedness, taking me aside, asserted that the matter had not been\nproperly set forth when I was inquiring about kites. Both old and young\nmen, he continued, frequently endeavoured to fly kites, even in the\ninvolved heart of the city. He had tried once or twice himself, but\nnever with encouraging success, chiefly, he was told, because his paper\nwas not good enough. Many people, he added, would not scruple to mislead\nme with evasive ambiguity on this one subject owing to an ill-balanced\nconception of what constituted true dignity, but he was unwilling\nthat his countrymen should be thought by mine to be sunk into a deeper\nbarbarism than actually existed.\n\nHis warning was not inopportune. Seated next to this person at a later\nperiod was a maiden from whose agreeably-poised lips had hitherto\nproceeded nothing but sincerity and fact. Watching her closely I asked\nher, as one who only had a languid interest either one way or the\nother, whether her revered father or her talented and richly-apparelled\nbrothers ever spent their time flying kites about the city. In spite of\na most efficient self-control her colour changed at my words, and her\nfeatures trembled for a moment, but quickly reverting to herself she\nreplied that she thought not; then--as though to subdue my suspicions\nmore completely--that she was sure they did not, as the kites would\ncertainly frighten the horses and the appointed watchmen of the street\nwould not allow it. She confessed, however, with unassumed candour, that\nthe immediate descendants of her sister were gracefully proficient in\nthe art.\n\nFrom this, great and enlightened one, you will readily perceive\nhow misleading an impression might be carried away by a person\nscrupulously-intentioned but not continually looking both ways, when\nplaced among a people endowed with the uneasy suspicion of the barbarian\nand struggling to assert a doubtful refinement. Apart from this, there\nhas to be taken into consideration their involved process of reasoning,\nand the unexpectedly different standards which they apply to every\nsubject.\n\nAt the house of the Maidens Blank, when the evening was not spent in\nlistening to melodious voices and the harmony of stringed woods, it was\nusual to take part in sit-round games of various kinds. (And while it\nis on his brush this person would say with commendable pride that a\nwell-trained musician among us can extort more sound from a hollow\nwooden pig, costing only a few cash, than the most skilful here ever\nattain on their largest instrument--a highly-lacquered coffin on legs,\nfilled with bells and hidden springs, and frequently sold for a thousand\ntaels.)\n\nUpon a certain evening, at the conclusion of one sit-round game which\ninvolved abrupt music, a barrier of chairs, and the exhilarating\npossibility of being sat upon by the young and vivacious in their zeal,\na person of the company turned suddenly to the one who is communicating\nwith you and said enticingly, \"Why did Birdcage Walk?\"\n\nNot judging from his expression that this was other than a polite\ninquiry on a matter which disturbed his repose, I was replying that the\nmanifestation was undoubtedly the work of a vexatious demon which had\ntaken up its abode in the article referred to, when another, by my side,\ncried aloud, \"Because it envied Queen Anne's Gate\"; and without a pause\ncast back the question, \"Who carved The Poultry?\"\n\nIn spite of the apparent simplicity of the demand it was received by\nall in an attitude of complicated doubt, and this person was considering\nwhether he might not acquire distinction by replying that such an office\nfell by custom to the lot of the more austere Maiden Blank, when the\nvery inadequate reply, \"Mark Lane with St. Mary's Axe,\" was received\nwith applause and some observations in a half-tone regarding the\nidentity of the fowl.\n\nBy the laws of the sit-round games the one who had last spoken now\nproclaimed himself, demanding to know, \"Why did Battersea Rise?\" but the\ninvolvement was evidently superficial, for the maiden at whose memory\nthis one's organs still vibrate ignobly at once replied, \"Because it\nthought Clapham Common,\" in turn inquiring, \"What made the Marble Arch?\"\n\nAlthough I would have willingly sacrificed to an indefinite extent to be\nfurnished with the preconcerted watchword, so that I might have enlarged\nmyself in the eyes of this consecrated being's unapproachable esteem,\nI had already decided that the competition was too intangible for\none whose thoughts lay in well-defined parallel lines, and it fell to\nanother to reply, \"To hear Salisbury Court.\"\n\nThis, O my broad-minded ancestor of the first degree--an aimless\nchallenge coupled with the name of one recognisable spot, replied to by\nthe haphazard retort of another place, frequently in no way joined to\nit, was regarded as an exceptionally fascinating sit-round game by a\ncompany of elderly barbarians!\n\n\"What couldn't Walbrook?\" it might be, and \"Such Cheapside,\" would be\ndeemed a praiseworthy solution. \"When did King's Bench Walk?\" would\nbe asked, and to reply, \"When Gray's Inn Road,\" covered the one with\noverpowering acclamation. \"Bevis Marks only an Inner Circle at The\nButts; why?\" was a demand of such elaborate complexity that (although\nthis person was lured out of his self-imposed restraint by the silence\nof all round, and submerging his intelligence to an acquired level,\nunobtrusively suggested, \"Because Aylesbury ducks, perchance\") it fell\nto the one propounding to announce, \"Because St. John's Wood Shoot-up\nHill.\"\n\nAdmittedly it is written, \"When the shutter is fastened the girdle is\nloosened,\" but it is as truly said, \"Not in the head, nor yet in the\nfeet, but in the organs of digestion does wisdom reside,\" and even in\njesting the middle course of neither an excessive pride nor an absolute\nweak-mindedness is to be observed. With what concrete pangs of acute\nmental distress would this person ever behold his immaculate progenitor\ntaking part in a similar sit-round game with an assembly of worthy\nmandarins, the one asking questions of meaningless import, as \"Why\ndid they Hangkow?\" and another replying in an equal strain of no\nconsecutiveness, \"In order to T'in Tung!\"\n\nAt length a person who is spoken of as having formerly been the captain\nof a band of warriors turned to me with an unsuspected absence of\nferocity and said, \"Your countrymen are very proficient in the art\nof epigram, are they not, Mr. Kong? Will you not, in turn, therefore,\nfavour us with an example?\" Whereupon several maidens exclaimed with\nengaging high temper, \"Oh yes; do ask us some funny Chinese riddles, Mr.\nKong!\"\n\n\"Assuredly there are among us many classical instances of the light\nsayings which require matching,\" I replied, gratified that I should have\nthe opportunity of showing their superiority. \"One, harmonious\nbeyond the blend of challenge and retort, is as follows--'The Phoenix\nembroidered upon the side of the shoe: When the shoe advances the\nPhoenix leaps forward.'\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried several of the maidens, and from the nature of their glances\nit might reasonably be gathered that already they began to recognise the\ninferiority of their own sayings.\n\n\"Is that the question, or the answer, or both?\" asked a youth of\nunfledged maturity, and to hide their conscious humiliation several\npersons allowed their faces to melt away.\n\n\"That which has been expressed,\" replied this person with an ungrudging\ntoleration, \"is the first or question portion of the contrast. The\nanswer is that which will be supplied by your honourable condescension.\"\n\n\"But,\" interposed one of the maidens, \"it isn't really a question, you\nknow, Mr. Kong.\"\n\n\"In a way of regarding it, it may be said to be question, inasmuch as it\nrequires an answer to establish the comparison. The most pleasing answer\nis that which shall be dissimilar in idea, and yet at the same time\nmaintain the most perfect harmony of parallel thought,\" I replied. \"Now\npermit your exceptional minds to wander in a forest of similitudes: 'The\nPhoenix embroidered upon the side of the shoe: When the shoe advances\nthe Phoenix leaps forward.'\"\n\n\"Oh, if that's all you want,\" said the one Herbert, who by an ill\ndestiny chanced to be present, \"'The red-hot poker held before the Cat's\nnose: When the poker advances the Cat leaps backwards.'\"\n\n\"Oh, very good!\" cried several of those around, \"of course it naturally\nwould. Is that right, Mr. Kong?\"\n\n\"If the high-souled company is satisfied, then it must be, for there is\nno conclusive right or wrong--only an unending search for that which\nis most gem-set and resourceful,\" replied this person, with an\never-deepening conviction of no enthusiasm towards the sit-round game.\n\"But,\" he added, resolved to raise for a moment the canopy of a mind\nswan-like in its crystal many-sidedness, and then leave them to their\nown ineptitude, \"for five centuries nothing has been judged equal to\nthe solution offered by Li Tang. At the time he was presented with\na three-sided banner of silk with the names of his eleven immediate\nancestors embroidered upon it in seven colours, and his own name is\nstill handed down in imperishable memory.\"\n\n\"Oh, do tell us what it was,\" cried many. \"It must have been clever.\"\n\n\"'The Dragon painted upon the face of the fan: When the fan is shaken\nthe Dragon flies upwards,'\" replied this person.\n\nIt cannot be denied that this was received with an attitude of\nrespectful melancholy strikingly complimentary to the wisdom of the\ngifted Li Tang. But whether it may be that the time was too short to\nassimilate the more subtle delicacies of the saying, or whether the\nbarbarian mind is inherently devoid of true balance, this person was\npanged most internally to hear one say to another as he went out, \"Do\nyou know, I really think that Herbert's was much the better answer of\nthe two--more realistic, and what you might expect at the pantomime.\" *\n\nA like inability to grasp with a clear and uninvolved vision, permeates\nnot only the triviality of a sit-round game but even the most important\ntransactions of existence.\n\nShortly after his arrival in the Island, this person was initiated\nby the widely-esteemed Quang-Tsun into the private life of one whose\noccupation was that of a Law-giver, where he frequently drank tea\non terms of mutual cordiality. Upon such an occasion he was one day\npresent, conversing with the lesser ones of the household--the head\nthereof being absent, setting forth the Law in the Temple--when one of\nthe maidens cried out with amiable vivacity, \"Why, Mr. Kong, you say\nsuch consistently graceful things of the ladies you have met over here,\nthat we shall expect you to take back an English wife with you. But\nperhaps you are already married in China?\"\n\n\"The conclusion is undeviating in its accuracy,\" replied this person,\nunable to evade the allusion. \"To Ning, Hia-Fa and T'ain Yen, as the\nmatter stands.\"\n\n\"Ning Hia-Fa An T'ain Yen!\" exclaimed the wife of the Law-giver\npleasantly. \"What an important name. Can you pardon our curiosity and\ntell us what she is like?\"\n\n\"Ning, Hia-Fa AND T'ain Yen,\" repeated this person, not submitting to\nbe deprived of the consequence of two wives without due protest. \"Three\nnames, three wives. Three very widely separated likes.\"\n\nAt this in no way boastfully uttered statement the agreeably outlined\nsurface of the faces around variated suddenly, the effect being one\nwhich I have frequently observed in the midst of my politest expressions\nof felicity. For a moment, indeed, I could not disguise from myself that\nthe one who had made the inquiry stretched forth her lotus-like hand\ntowards the secret spring by which it is customary to summon the\nattending slaves from the underneath parts, but restraining herself\nwith the manner of one who would desire to make less of a thing that it\notherwise might seem, she turned to me again.\n\n\"How nice!\" she murmured. \"What a pity you did not bring them all with\nyou, Mr. Kong. They would have been a great acquisition.\"\n\n\"Yet it must be well weighed,\" I replied, not to be out-complimented\ntouching one another, \"that here they would have met so many fine and\nsuperior gentlemen that they might have become dissatisfied with my less\nthan average prepossessions.\"\n\n\"I wonder if they did not think of that in your case, and refuse to let\nyou come,\" said one of the maidens.\n\n\"The various persons must not be regarded as being on their all fours,\"\nI replied, anxious that there should be no misunderstanding on this\npoint. \"They, of course, reside within one inner chamber, but there\nwould be no duplicity in this one adding indefinitely to the number.\"\n\n\"Of course not; how silly of me!\" exclaimed the maiden. \"What splendid\nmusical evenings you can have. But tell me, Mr. Kong (ought it not to be\nMessrs. Kong, mamma?), if a girl married you here would she be legally\nmarried to you in China?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" replied this person positively.\n\n\"But could you not, by your own laws, have the marriage set aside\nwhenever you wished?\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" I admitted. \"It is so appointed.\"\n\n\"Then how could she be legally married?\" she persisted, with really\nunbecoming suspicion.\n\n\"Legally married, legally unmarried,\" replied this person, quite\ndistressed within himself at not being able to understand the difficulty\nbesetting her. \"All perfectly legal and honourably observed.\"\n\n\"I think, Gwendoline--\" said the one of authority, and although the\nmatter was no further expressed, by an instinct which he was powerless\nto avert, this person at once found himself rising with ceremonious\npartings.\n\nNot desiring that the obstacle should remain so inadequately swept\naway, I have turned my presumptuous footsteps in the direction of the\nLaw-giver's house on several later occasions, but each time the word of\nthe slave guarding the door has been that they of the household,\ndown even to those of the most insignificant degree of kinship, have\nwithdrawn to a distant and secluded spot.\n\nWith renewed assurances that the enterprise is being gracefully\nconducted, however ill-digested and misleading these immature\ncompositions may appear.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER IV\n\n\n Concerning a desire to expatiate upon subjects of\n philosophical importance and its no accomplishment. Three\n examples of the mental concavity sunk into by these\n barbarians. An involved episode which had the outward\n appearance of being otherwise than what it was.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE (whose genial liberality on all necessary occasions\nis well remembered by this person in his sacrifices, with the titles\n\"Benevolent\" and \"Open-sleeved\"),--\n\nI had it in my head at one time to tell you somewhat of the Classics\nmost reverenced in this country, of the philosophical opinions which\nprevail, and to enlighten you generally upon certain other subjects of\ndistinguished eminence. As the deities arranged, however, it chanced\nthat upon my way to a reputable quarter of the city where the actuality\nof these matters can be learnt with the least evasion, my footsteps were\ndrawn aside by an incident which now permeates my truth-laden brush to\nthe exclusion of all else.\n\nBut in the first place, if it be permitted for a thoroughly\nuntrustworthy son to take so presumptuous a liberty with an unvaryingly\nsagacious father, let this one entreat you to regard everything he\nwrites in a very wide-headed spirit of looking at the matter from all\nround. My former letters will have readily convinced you that much that\ntakes place here, even among those who can afford long finger-nails,\nwould not be tolerated in Yuen-ping, and in order to avoid the suspicion\nthat I am suffering from a serious injury to the head, or have become\na prey to a conflicting demon, it will be necessary to continue an\neven more highly-sustained tolerant alertness. This person himself has\nfrequently suffered the ill effects of rashly assuming that because he\nis conducting the adventure in a prepossessing spirit his efforts will\nbe honourably received, as when he courteously inquired the ages of a\ncompany of maidens into whose presence he was led, and complimented the\none whom he was desirous of especially gratifying by assuring her that\nshe had every appearance of being at least twice the nine-and-twenty\nyears to which she modestly laid claim.\n\nUpon another occasion I entered a barber's stall, and finding it\noppressively hot within, I commanded the attendant to carry a reclining\nstool into the street and there shave my lower limbs and anoint my head.\nAs he hesitated to obey--doubtless on account of the trivial labour\ninvolved--I repeated my words in a tone of fuller authority, holding out\nthe inducement of a just payment when he complied, and assuring him that\nhe would certainly be dragged before the nearest mandarin and tortured\nif he held his joints stiffly. At this he evidently understood his\ndanger, for obsequiously protesting that he was only a barber of very\nmean attainments, and that his deformed utensils were quite inadequate\nfor the case, he very courteously directed me in inquire for a public\nchariot bound for a quarter called Colney Hatch (the place of commerce,\nit is reasonable to infer, of the higher class barbers), and, seating\nmyself in it, instruct the attendant to put me down at the large gates,\nwhere they possessed every requisite appliance, and also would, if\ndesirable, shave my head also. Here the incident assumes a more doubtful\nguise, for, notwithstanding the admitted politeness of the one who\nspoke, each of those to whom I subsequently addressed myself on the\nsubject, presented to me a face quite devoid of encouragement. While\nnone actually pointed out the vehicle I sought, many passed on in a\nstate of inward contemplation without replying, and some--chiefly the\nattendants of other chariots of a similar kind--replied in what I deemed\nto be a spirit of elusive metaphor, as he who asserted that such a\nconveyance must be sought for at a point known intimately as the Aldgate\nPump, whence it started daily at half-past the thirteenth gong-stroke;\nand another, who maintained that I had no prospect of reaching the\ndesired spot until I secured the services of one of a class of female\nattendants who wear flowing blue robes in order to indicate that they\nare prepared to encounter and vanquish any emergency in life. To make no\nelaborate pretence in the matter this person may definitely admit that\nhe never did reach the place in question, nor--in spite of a diligent\nsearch in which he has encountered much obloquy--has he yet found any\nbarber sufficiently well equipped to undertake the detail.\n\nEven more recently I suffered the unmerited rebuke of the superficial\nthrough performing an act of deferential politeness. Learning that the\nenlightened and magnanimous sovereign of this country was setting out on\na journey I stationed myself in the forefront of those who stood before\nhis palace, intending to watch such parts of the procession as might be\nfitly witnessed by one of my condition. When these had passed, and the\nchariot of the greatest approached, I respectfully turned my back to\nthe road with a propitiatory gesture, as of one who did not deem himself\nworthy even to look upon a being of such majestic rank and acknowledged\nexcellence. This delicate action, by some incredible process of mental\nobliquity, was held by those around to be a deliberate insult, if not\neven a preconcerted signal, of open treachery, and had not a heaven-sent\nbreeze at that moment carried the hat of a very dignified bystander into\nthe upper branches of an opportune tree, and successfully turned aside\nthe attention of the assembly into a most immoderate exhibition of utter\nloss of gravity, I should undoubtedly have been publicly tortured, if\nnot actually torn to pieces.\n\nBut the incident first alluded to was of an even more\nelaborately-contrived density than these, and some of the details are\nstill unrolled before the keenest edge of this one's inner perception.\nNevertheless, all is now set down in unbroken exactness for your\nimpartial judgment.\n\nAt the time of this exploit I had only ventured out on a few occasions,\nand then, save those recorded, to no considerable extent; for it had\nalready become obvious that the enterprises in which I persistently\nbecame involved never contributed to my material prosperity, and the\ndisappointment of finding that even when I could remember nine words\nof a sentence in their language none of the barbarians could understand\neven so much as a tenth of my own, further cast down my enthusiasm.\n\nOn the day which has been the object of this person's narration from\nthe first, he set out to become more fully instructed in the subjects\nalready indicated, and proceeding in a direction of which he had no\nactual knowledge, he soon found himself in a populous and degraded\nquarter of the city. Presently, to his reasonable astonishment, he saw\nbefore him at a point where two ill-constructed thoroughfares met, a\nspacious and important building, many-storied in height, ornamented\nwith a profusion of gold and crystal, marble and precious stones,\nand displaying from a tall pole the three-hued emblem of undeniable\nauthority. A never-ending stream of people passed in and out by the\nnumerous doors; the strains of expertly wielded instruments could be\ndistinctly heard inside, and the warm odour of a most prepossessing\nspiced incense permeated the surroundings. \"Assuredly,\" thought the\nperson who is now recording the incident, \"this is one of the Temples\nof barbarian worship\"; and to set all further doubt at rest he saw in\nletters of gilt splendour a variety of praiseworthy and appropriate\ninscriptions, among which he read and understood, \"Excellent,\" \"Fine\nOld,\" \"Well Matured,\" \"Spirits only of the choicest quality within,\"\ntogether with many other invocations from which he could not wrest the\nhidden significance, as \"Old Vatted,\" \"Barclay's Entire,\" \"An Ordinary\nat One,\" and the like.\n\nBy this time an impressive gathering had drawn around, and from its\nmanner of behaving conveyed the suspicion that an entertainment or\nmanifestation of some kind was confidently awaited. To disperse so\noutrageous a misconception this person was on the point of withdrawing\nhimself when he chanced to see, over the principal door of the Temple,\na solid gold figure of colossal magnitude, represented as crowned with\nleaves and tendrils, and holding in his outstretched hands a gigantic,\nand doubtless symbolic, bunch of grapes. \"This,\" I said to myself, \"is\nevidently the tutelary deity of the place, so displayed to receive the\nworship of the passer-by.\" With the discovery a thought of the most\nirreproachable benevolence possessed me. \"Why should not this person,\" I\nreflected, \"gain the unstinted approbation of those barbarians\" (who by\nthis time completely encircled me in) \"by doing obeisance towards their\ndeity, and by the same act delicately and inoffensively rebuke them for\ntheir own too-frequent intolerable attitude towards the susceptibilities\nof others? As an unprejudiced follower, in his own land, of the systems\nof Confucius, Lao-tse, and Buddha, this person already recognises the\nclaims of seventeen thousand nine hundred and thirty-three deities of\nvarious grades, so that the addition of one more to that number can be\na heresy of very trivial expiation.\" Inspired by these honourable\nsentiments, therefore, I at once prostrated myself on the ground, and,\namid a silence of really illimitable expectation, I began to kow-tow\nrepeatedly with ceremonious precision.\n\nAt this display of charitable broadmindedness an approving shout went\nup on all sides. Thus encouraged I proceeded to kow-tow with even more\nunceasing assiduousness, and presently words of definite encouragement\nmingled with the shout. \"Do not flag in your amiable disinterestedness,\nKong Ho,\" I whispered in my ear, \"and out of your well-sustained\nendurance may perchance arise a cordial understanding, and ultimately\na remunerative alliance between two distinguished nations.\" Filled with\nthis patriotic hope I did not suffer my neck to stiffen, and doubtless I\nwould have continued the undertaking as long as the sympathetic persons\nwho hemmed me in signified their refined approval, when suddenly the cry\nwas raised, \"Look out, here comes the coppers!\"\n\nThis, O my venerable-headed father, I at once guessed to be the\nannouncement heralding the collecting-bowl which some over-zealous\nbystander was preparing to pass round on my behalf, doubtless under the\nimpression--so obtuse in grasping the true relationship of events are\nmany of the barbarians--that I was a wandering monk, displaying my\nreverence for the purpose of mendicancy. Not wishing to profit by this\noffensive misapprehension, I was preparing to rise, when a hand was\nunceremoniously laid upon my shoulder, and turning round I saw behind me\none of the official watch--a class of men so powerful that at a gesture\nfrom their uplifted hands even the fiercest untamed horse will not\ninfrequently stand upon its hind legs in mute submission.\n\n\"Early morning salutations,\" I said pleasantly, though somewhat involved\nin speech by my exertion (for these persons are ever to be treated\nwith discriminating courtesy). \"Prosperity to your house, O energetic\nstreet-watcher, and a thousand grandsons to worship their illustrious\nancestor.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he replied concisely. \"I'm a single man. As yet. Now then,\nwill you make a way there? Can you stand?\"\n\n\"Stand?\" repeated this person, at once recognising one of the important\nwords of inner meaning concerning which he had been initiated by the\nversatile Quang-Tsun. \"Certainly this person will not hesitate to\nestablish his footing if the exaction is thought to be desirable.\nLet us, therefore, bend our steps in the direction of a tea-house of\nunquestionable propriety.\"\n\n\"You've bent your steps into quite enough tea-houses, as you call them,\nfor one day,\" replied the official with evasive meaning, at the same\ntime assisting me to rise (for it need not be denied that the restrained\nposition had made me for the moment incapable of a self-sustaining\neffort). \"Look what you've done.\"\n\nAt the direction of his glance I cast my eyes along the street, east and\nwest, and for the first time I became aware that what I had last seen as\na reasonable gathering had now taken the proportions of an innumerable\nmultitude which filled the entire space of the thoroughfare, while\nothers covered the roofs above and protruded themselves from every\navailable window. In our own land the interspersal of umbrellas, musical\ninstruments, and banners, with an occasional firework, would have given\na greater animation to the scene; but with this exception I have never\ntaken part in a more impressive and well-extended procession. Even\nwhile I looked, the helmets of other official watchers appeared in the\ndistance, as immature junks upon the storm-tossed Whang-Hai, apparently\nstriving fruitlessly to reach us.\n\nAs I was by no means sure what attitude was expected of me, I smiled\nwith an all-embracing approval, and signified to the one at my side, by\nway of passing the time pleasurably together, that the likelihood of his\nnimble-witted friends reaching us with unruffled garments was remote in\nthe extreme.\n\n\"Don't you let that worry you, Li Hung Chang,\" he said, in a tone that\nhad the appearance of being outside itself around a deeper and more\nbitter significance; \"if we get out again with any garments at all it\nwon't be your fault. Why, you--well, YOU ought to have been put on the\nBlack List long ago, by rights.\"\n\nThis, exalted one, although I have not yet been able to learn the exact\ndignity of it from any of the books of civil honours, is undoubtedly\na mark of signal attainment, conferred upon the few for distinguishing\nthemselves by some particular capacity; as our Double Dragon, for\ninstance. Anxious to learn something of the privileges of the rank from\none who evidently was not without influence in the bestowal, and not\nunwilling to show him that I was by no means of low-caste descent, I\nsaid to the official, \"In his own country one of this person's ancestors\nwore the Decoration of the Yellow Scabbard, which entitled him to be\ncarried in his chair up to the gate of the Forbidden Palace before\ndescending to touch the ground. Is this Order of the Black List of a\nlike purport?\"\n\n\"You're right,\" he said, \"it is. In this country it entitles you to be\ncarried right inside the door at Bow Street without ever touching the\nground. Look out! Now we shall not--\"\n\nAt that moment what this person at first assumed to be a floral tribute,\nuntil he saw that not only the entire plant, but the earthenware jar\nalso were attached, struck the official upon the helmet, whereupon,\ndrawing a concealed club, he ceased speaking.\n\nHow the entertainment was conducted to such a development this person is\ntotally inadequate to express; but in an incredibly short space of time\nthe scene became one of most entrancing variety. From every visible\npoint around the air became filled with commodities which--though\ndoubtless without set intention--fittingly represented the arts,\nmanufactures, and natural history of this resourceful country, all cast\nin prolific abundance at the feet of the official and myself, although\nthe greater part inevitably struck our heads and bodies before reaching\nthem. Beyond our immediate circle, as it may be expressed, the crowd\nnever ceased to press forward with resistless activity, and among\nit could be seen occasionally the official watchmen advancing\nself-reliantly, though frequently without helmets, and, not less often,\nthe helmets advancing without the official watchmen. To add to the\nacknowledged interest, every person present was proclaiming his views\nfreely on a diversity of subjects, and above all could be heard the\nclear notes of the musical instruments by which the officials sought\nto encourage one another in their extremity, and to deaden the cries of\nthose whom they outclubbed.\n\nDespite this person's repeated protests that the distinction was too\nexcessive, he was plucked from hand to hand irresistibly among those\naround, losing a portion of his ill-made attire at each step, so\nagreeably anxious were all to detain him. Just when the exploit seemed\nlikely to have a disagreeable ending, however, he was thrust heavily\nagainst a door which yielded, and at once barring it behind him, he\npassed across the open space into which it led, along a passage between\ntwo walls, and thence through an involved labyrinth and beneath the\nwaters of a canal into a wood of attractive seclusion. Here this person\nremained, spending the time in a profitable meditation, until the light\nwithdrew and the great sky lantern had ascended. Then he cautiously\ncrept forth, and after some further trivial episodes which chiefly\nconcern the obstinate-headed slave guarding the outer door of a\ntea-house, an unintelligent maiden in the employment of one vending\nsilk-embroidered raiment, the mercenary controller of a two-wheeled\nchariot and the sympathetic and opportune arrival of a person seated\nupon a funeral car, he succeeded in reaching the place of his abode.\n\nWith unalterable affection and a material request that an unstinted\nadequacy of new garments may be sent by a sure and speedy hand.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER V\n\n\n Concerning the neglect of ancestors and its discreditable\n consequences. Two who state the matter definitely.\n Concerning the otherside way of looking at things and the\n self-contradictory bearing of the maiden Florence.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--A discovery of overwhelming malignity oppresses me. In\nspite of much baffling ambiguity and the frequent evasion of conscious\nguilt, there can be no longer any reasonable doubt that these barbarians\nDO NOT WORSHIP THEIR ANCESTORS!\n\nHitherto the matter had rested in my mind as an uneasy breath of\nsuspicion, agitated from time to time by countless indications that\nsuch a possibility might, indeed, exist in a condensed form, but too\ninauspiciously profane to be contemplated in the altogether. Thus, when\nin the company of the young this person has walked about the streets\nof the city, he may at length have said, \"Truly, out of your amiable\ncondescension, you have shown me a variety of entrancing scenes. Let\nus now in turn visit the tombs of your ancestors, to the end that I may\ntransmit fitting gifts to their spirits and discharge a few propitious\nfireworks as a greeting.\" Yet in no case has this well-intentioned\noffer been agilely received, one asserting that he did not know\nthe resting-place of the tombs in question, a second that he had no\nancestors, a third that Kensal Green was not an entrancing spot for\na wet afternoon, a fourth that he would see them removed to a greater\ndistance first, another that he drew the line at mafficking in a\ncemetery, and the like. These things, it may occur to your omniscience,\nmight in themselves have been conclusive, yet the next reference to the\nmatter would perhaps be tending to a more alluring hope.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" a person has remarked in the hearing of this one, \"I go\nto the Stratford which is upon the Avon, and without a pause I shall\nprostrate myself intellectually before the immortal Shakespeare's tomb\nand worship his unequalled memory.\"\n\n\"The intention is benevolently conceived,\" I remarked. \"Yet has he no\ndescendants, this same Shakespeare, that the conciliation of his spirit\nmust be left to chance?\"\n\nWhen he assured me that this calamity had come about, I would have added\na richly-gilded brick from my store for transmission also, in the hope\nthat the neglected and capricious shadow would grant me an immunity from\nits resentful attention, but the one in question raised a barrier of\ndissent. If I wished to adorn a tomb, he added (evading the deeper\nsignificance of the act), there was that of Goldsmith within its Temple,\nupon which many impressionable maidens from across the Bitter Waters of\nthe West make it a custom to deposit chaplets of verses, in the hope\nof seeing the offering chronicled in the papers; and in the Open Space\ncalled Trafalgar there were the images of a great captain who led many\njunks to victory and the Emperor of a former dynasty, where doubtless\nthe matter could be arranged; but the surrounding had by this time\nbecome too involved, and this person had no alternative but to smile\nsymmetrically and reply that his words were indeed opals falling from a\ntopaz basin.\n\nLater in the day, being desirous of becoming instructed more definitely,\nI addressed myself to a venerable person who makes clean the passage of\nthe way at a point not far distant.\n\n\"If you have no sons to extend your industrious line,\" I said, when he\nhad revealed this fact to me, \"why do you not adopt one to that end?\"\n\nWith narrow-minded covetousness, he replied that nowadays he had enough\nto do to keep himself, and that it would be more reasonable to get some\none to adopt HIM.\n\n\"But,\" I exclaimed, ignoring this ill-timed levity, \"who, when you\nhave Passed Beyond, will worship you and transmit to your spirit the\nnecessities of life?\"\n\n\"Governor,\" he replied, using the term of familiar dignity, \"I've made\nshift without being worshipped for five and sixty years, and it worries\nme a sight more to know who will transmit to my body the necessities of\nlife until I HAVE Passed Beyond.\"\n\n\"The final consequences of your self-opinionated carelessness,\" this\nperson continued, \"will be that your neglected and unprovided shadow,\nfinding itself no longer acceptable to the society of the better\nclass demons, will wander forth, and allying itself in despair to the\ncompanionship of a band of outcasts like itself, will be driven to dwell\nin unclean habitations and to subsist on the uncertain bounty of the\ncharitable.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" replied the irredeemable person before me. \"I can't help\nits troubles. I have to do all that myself as it is.\"\n\nDoubtless this fanaticism contains the secret of the ease with which\nthese barbarians have possessed themselves of the greater part of the\nearth, and have even planted their assertive emblems on one or two spots\nin our own Flowery Kingdom. What, O my esteemed parent, what can a brave\nbut devout and demon-fearing nation do when opposed to a people who are\nquite prepared to die without first leaving an adequate posterity to\ntend their shrines and offer incense? Assuredly, as a neighbouring\nphilosopher once had occasion to remark, using for his purpose a\nmetaphor so technically-involved that I must leave the interpretation\nuntil we meet, \"It may be war, but it isn't cricket.\"\n\nThe inevitable outcome, naturally, is that the Island must be the\nwandering-place of myriads of spirits possessing no recognised standing,\nand driven by want--having none to transmit them offerings--to the most\ndegraded subterfuges. It is freely admitted that there is scarcely an\nancient building not the abode of one or more of these abandoned demons,\ndoubtless well-disposed in the first instance, and capable of becoming\nreally beneficent Forces until they were driven to despair by obstinate\nneglect. A society of very honourable persons (to which this one has\nunobtrusively contributed a gift), exists for the purpose of searching\nout the most distressing and meritorious cases among them, and removing\nthem, where possible, to a more congenial spot. The remarkable fact,\nto this person's mind, is, that with the air and every available\nspace around absolutely packed with demons (as certainly must be the\nprevailing state of things), the manifestations of their malignity and\nvice are, if anything, rather less evident here than in our own favoured\ncountry, where we do all in our power to satisfy their wants.\n\nThat same evening I found myself seated next to a maiden of\nprepossessing vivacity, who was spoken of as being one of a kindred\nbut not identical race. Filled with the incredible profanity of those\naround, and hoping to find among a nation so alluringly high-spirited\na more congenial elevation of mind, I at length turned to her and said,\n\"Do not regard the question as one of unworthy curiosity, for this\nperson's inside is white and funereal with his fears; but do you, of\nyour allied race, worship your ancestors?\"\n\nThe maiden spent a moment in conscientious thought. \"No, Mr. Kong,\" she\nreplied, with a most commendable sigh of unfeigned regret, \"I can't say\nthat we do. I guess it's because we're too new. Mine, now, only go back\ntwo generations, and they were mostly in lard. If they were old and\nbaronial it might be different, but I can't imagine myself worshipping\nan ancestor in lard.\" (This doubtless refers to some barbaric method of\nembalming.)\n\n\"And your wide and enlightened countrymen?\" I asked, unable to restrain\na passion of pure-bred despair. \"Do they also so regard the obligation?\"\n\n\"I am afraid so,\" replied the maiden, with an honourable indication\ntowards my emotion. \"But of course when a girl marries into the European\naristocracy, she and all her folk worship her husband's ancestors, until\nevery one about is fairly dizzy with the subject.\"\n\nIt is largely owing to the graceful and virtuous conversation of these\nlesser ones that this person's knowledge of the exact position which\nthe ceremonial etiquette of the country demands on various occasions is\nbecoming so proficiently enlarged. It is true that they of my own sex do\nnot hesitate to inquire with penetrating assiduousness into certain of\nthe manners and customs of our land, but these for the most part do\nnot lead to a conversation in any way profitable to my discreeter\nunderstanding. Those of the inner chamber, on the other hand, while\nnot scrupling to question me on the details of dress, the braiding and\ngumming of the hair, the style and variety of the stalls of merchants,\nthe wearing of jade, gold, and crystal ornaments and flowers about\nthe head, smoking, and other matters affecting our lesser ones, very\nmagnanimously lead my contemplation back to a more custom-established\ntopic if by any hap in my ambitious ignorance I outstep it.\n\nIn such a manner it chanced on a former occasion that I sat side by side\nwith a certain maiden awaiting the return of others who had withdrawn\nfor a period. The season was that of white rains, and the fire being\nlavishly extended about the grate we had harmoniously arranged ourselves\nbefore it, while this person, at the repeated and explicit encouragement\nof the maiden, spoke openly of such details of the inner chamber as he\nhas already indicated.\n\n\"Is it true, Mr. Ho\" (thus the maiden, being unacquainted with the\nactual facts, consistently addressed me), \"that ladies' feet are\nrelentlessly compressed until they finally assume the proportions and\nappearance of two bulbs?\" and as she spoke she absent-mindedly regarded\nher own slippers, which were out-thrust somewhat to receive the action\nof the fire.\n\n\"It is a matter which cannot reasonably be denied,\" I replied; \"and\nit is doubtless owing to this effect that they are designated 'Golden\nLilies.' Yet when this observance has been slowly and painfully\naccomplished, the extremities in question are not less small but\ninfinitely less graceful than the select and naturally-formed pair which\nthis person sees before him.\" And at the ingeniously-devised compliment\n(which, not to become large-headed in self-imagination, it must be\nadmitted was revealed to me as available for practically all occasions\nby the really invaluable Quang-Tsun), I bowed unremittingly.\n\n\"O, Mr. Ho!\" exclaimed the maiden, and paused abruptly at the sound of\nher words, as though they were inept.\n\n\"In many other ways a comparison equally irreproachable to the exalted\nbeing at my side might be sought out,\" I continued, suddenly forming\nthe ill-destined judgment that I was no less competent than the more\nexperienced Quang-Tsun to contrive delicate offerings of speech. \"Their\nhair is rope like in its lack of spontaneous curve, their eyes as\ndeficient in lustre as a half-shuttered window; their hands are\nexceedingly inferior in colour, and both on the left side, as it may be\nexpressed; their legs--\" but at this point the maiden drew herself so\nhastily into herself that I had no alternative but to conclude that\nunless I reverted in some way the enterprise was in peril of being\ninharmoniously conducted.\n\n\"Mr. Ho,\" said the maiden, after contemplating her inward thoughts for\na moment, \"you are a foreigner, and you cannot be expected to know by\ninstinct what may and what may not be openly expressed in this country.\nTherefore, although the obligation is not alluring, I think it kinder\nto tell you that the matters which formed the subject of your last words\nare never to be referred to.\"\n\nAt this rebuke I again bowed persistently, for it did not appear\nreasonable to me that I could in any other way declare myself without\nviolating the imposed command.\n\n\"Not only are they never openly referred to,\" continued the maiden,\nwho in spite of the declared no allurement of the subject did not seem\ndisposed to abandon it at once, \"but among the most select they are,\nby unspoken agreement, regarded as 'having no actual existence,' as you\nyourself would say.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" protested this person, somewhat puzzled, \"to one who has\nwitnessed the highly-achieved attitudes of those within your Halls of\nHarmony, and in an unyielding search for knowledge has addressed himself\neven to the advertisement pages of the ladies' papers--\"\n\nThe maiden waved her hand magnanimously. \"In your land, as you have told\nme, there are many things, not really existing, which for politeness you\nassume to be. In a like but converse manner this is to be so regarded.\"\n\nI thanked her voluminously. \"The etiquette of this country is as\ninvolved as the spoken tongue,\" I said, \"for both are composed chiefly\nof exceptions to a given rule. It was formerly impressed upon this\nperson, as a guiding principle, that that which is unseen is not to be\ndiscussed; yet it is not held in disrepute to allude to so intimate and\nsecluded an organ as the heart, for no further removed than yesterday he\nheard the deservedly popular sea-lieutenant in the act of declaring to\nyou, upon his knees, that you were utterly devoid of such a possession.\"\n\nAt this inoffensively-conveyed suggestion, the fire opposite had all the\nappearance of suddenly reflecting itself into the maiden's face with a\nmost engaging concentration, while at the same time she stamped her foot\nin ill-concealed rage.\n\n\"You've been listening at the door!\" she cried impetuously, \"and I shall\nnever forgive you.\"\n\n\"To no extent,\" I declared hastily (for although I had indeed been\nlistening at the door, it appeared, after the weight which she set\nupon the incident, more honourable that I should deny it in order to\nconciliate her mind). \"It so chanced that for the moment this person\nhad forgotten whether the handle he was grasping was of the push-out or\nturn-in variety, and in the involvement a few words of no particular or\nenduring significance settled lightly upon his perception.\n\n\"In that case,\" she replied in high-souled liberality, while her eyes\nscintillated towards me with a really all-overpowering radiance, \"I will\nforgive you.\"\n\n\"We have an old but very appropriate saying, 'To every man the voice of\none maiden carries further than the rolling of thunder,'\" I remarked\nin a significantly restrained tone; for, although conscious that the\ncircumstance was becoming more menace-laden than I had any previous\nintention, I found myself to be incapable of extrication. \"Florence--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she exclaimed quickly, raising her polished hand with an\nundeniable gesture of reproof, \"you must not call me by my christian\nname, Mr. Ho.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" replied this person, with a confessedly stubborn inelegance, \"you\ncall me by the name of Ho.\"\n\nHer eyes became ox-like in an utter absence of almond outline. \"Yes,\"\nshe said gazing, \"but that--that is not your christian name, is it?\"\n\n\"In a position of speaking--this one being as a matter of fact a\ndiscreditable follower of the sublime Confucius--it may be so regarded,\"\nI answered, \"inasmuch as it is the milk-name of childhood.\"\n\n\"But you always put it last,\" she urged.\n\n\"Assuredly,\" I replied. \"Being irrevocably born with the family name of\nKong, it is thought more reasonable that that should stand first. After\nthat, others are attached as the various contingencies demand it, as Ho\nupon participating in the month-age feast, the book-name of Tsin at a\nlater period, Paik upon taking a degree, and so forth.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry, Mr. Kong,\" said the maiden, adding, with what at\nthe time certainly struck this person as shallow-witted prejudice. \"Of\ncourse it is really quite your own fault for being so tospy-turvily\narranged in every way. But, to return to the subject, why should not one\nspeak of one's heart?\"\n\n\"Because,\" replied this person, colouring deeply, and scarcely able to\ncontrol his unbearable offence that so irreproachably-moulded a creature\nshould openly refer to the detail, \"because it is a gross and unrefined\nparticular, much more internal and much less pleasantly-outlined\nthan those extremities whose spoken equivalent shall henceforth be an\nabandoned word from my lips.\"\n\n\"But, in any case, it is not the actual organ that one infers,\"\nprotested the maiden. \"As the seat of the affections, passions, virtues,\nand will, it is the conventional emblem of every thought and emotion.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" I cried, forgetting in the face of so heterodox an\nassertion that it would be well to walk warily at every point. \"That is\nthe stomach.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the maiden, burying her face in a gracefully-perfumed\nremnant of lace, to so overwhelming a degree that for the moment I\nfeared she might become involved in the dizzy falling. \"Never, by any\nmischance, use that word again the society of the presentable, Mr.\nKong.\"\n\n\"The ceremonial usage of my own land of the Heavenly Dynasty is\nproverbially elaborate,\" I said, with a gesture of self-abasement, \"but\nin comparison with yours it may be regarded as an undeviating walk when\nopposed to a stately and many-figured dance. Among the company of the\nreally excessively select (in which must ever be included the one whom\nI am now addressing), it becomes difficult for an outcast of my\nillimitable obtuseness to move to one side or the other without putting\nhis foot into that.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" exclaimed the maiden, in fragrant encouragement, \"I think you\nare getting on very nicely, Mr. Kong, and one does not look for absolute\nconformance from a foreigner--especially one who is so extremely\nforeign. If I can help you with anything--of course I could not even\nspeak as I have done to an ordinary stranger, but with one of a distant\nrace it seems different--if I can tell you anything that will save\nyou--\"\n\n\"You are all-exalted,\" I replied, with seemly humility, \"and virtue and\nwisdom press out your temples on either side. Certainly, since I have\nlearned that the heart is so poetically regarded, I have been assailed\nby a fear lest other organs which I have hitherto despised might be used\nin a similar way. Now, as regards liver--\"\n\n\"It is only used with bacon,\" replied the maiden, rising abruptly.\n\n\"Kidneys?\" suggested this person diffidently, really anxious to detain\nher footsteps, although from her expression it did not rest assured that\nthe incident was taking an actually auspicious movement.\n\n\"I don't think you need speak of those except at breakfast,\" she said;\n\"but I hear the others returning, and I must really go to dress for\ndinner.\"\n\nAmong the barbarians many keep books wherein to inscribe their deep and\nbeautiful thoughts. This person had therefore provided himself with\none also, and, drawing it forth, he now added to a page of many other\ninteresting compositions: \"Maidens of immaculate refinement do not\nhesitate to admit before a person of a different sex that they are on\nthe point of changing their robes. The liver is in some intricate way\nan emblem representing bacon, or together with it the two stand for\na widely differing analogy. Among those of the highest exclusiveness\nkidneys are never alluded to after the tenth gong-stroke of the\nmorning.\"\n\nWith a sincerely ingrained trust that the scenes of dignity, opulence,\nand wisdom, set forth in these superficial letters, are not unsettling\nyour intellect and causing you to yearn for a fuller existence.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VI\n\n\n Concerning this person's well-sustained efforts to discover\n further demons. The behaviour of those invoked on two\n occasions.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--In an early letter I made some reference to a variety\nof demon invoked by certain of the barbarians. As this matter aroused\nyour congenial interest, I have since privately bent my mind incessantly\nto the discovery of others; but this has been by no means easy, for,\ntouching the more intimate details of the subject, the barbarians\nfrequently maintain a narrow-minded suspicion. Many whom I have\napproached feign to become amused or have evaded a deliberate answer\nunder the subterfuge of a jest; yet, whenever I would have lurked by\nnight in their temples or among the enclosed spaces of their tombs to\nlearn more, at a given signal one in authority has approached me with\nanxiety and mistrust engraved upon his features, and, disregarding my\nunassuming protest that I would remain alone in a contemplative reverie,\nhas signified that so devout an exercise is contrary to their written\nlaw.\n\nOn one occasion only did this person seem to hold himself poised on the\nvery edge of a fuller enlightenment. This was when, in the venerable\ncompany of several benevolent persons, he was being taken from place to\nplace to see the more important buildings, and to observe the societies\nof artificers labouring at their crafts. The greater part of the day had\nalready been spent in visiting temples, open spaces reserved to children\nand those whose speech, appearance, and general manner of behaving\nmake it desirable that they should be set apart from the contact of the\nimpressionable, halls containing relics and emblems of the past,\nplaces of no particular size or attraction but described as being of\nunparalleled historic interest, and the stalls of the more reputable\nvenders of merchandise.\n\nDoubtless, with observing so many details of a conflicting nature,\nthis person's discriminating faculties had become obscured, but towards\nevening he certainly understood that we sought the company of an\nassembly of those who had been selected from all the Empire to pronounce\ndefinitely upon matters of supreme import. The building before which our\nchariot stopped had every appearance of being worthy of so exceptional a\ngathering, and with a most affluent joy that I should at last be able to\nglean a decisive pronouncement, I evaded those who had accompanied\nme, and, mingling self-reliantly with the throng inside, I quickly\nsurrounded myself with many of the wisest-looking, and begged that they\nwould open their heads freely and express their innermost opinions upon\nthe subject of demons of all kinds.\n\nAlthough I had admittedly hoped that these persons would not conceal\nthemselves behind the wings of epigram or intangible prevarication, I\nwas far from being prepared for the candour with which they greeted me,\nand although by long usage I am reasonably unconcerned at the proximity\nof any of our own recognised genii, it is not to be denied that my\norgans of ferocity grew small and unstable at the revelations.\n\nFrom their words it appeared that the spot on which we stood had\nlong been the recognised centre and meeting-place for every class of\nabandoned and objectionable spirit of the universe. Not only this, but\nseveral of the persons who had gathered around were confidently pointed\nout as the earthly embodiment of various diabolical Forces, while others\ncheerfully admitted that they themselves were the shadows of certain\nillustrious ones who had long Passed Above, and all united in declaring\nthat those who moved among them wearing the distinction of a dark blue\nuniform were Evil Beings of a most ghoulish and repulsive type. Indeed,\nas I looked more closely, I could see that not only those pointed out,\nbut all standing around, had expressions immeasurably more in\nkeeping with a band of outcast spirits than suggestive of an assembly\nrepresenting wisdom and dignified ease. At that moment, however, a most\ninelegant movement was caused by one suddenly declaring that he\nhad recognised this one who is inscribing his experiences to be the\napparition of a certain great reformer who during the period of his\nordinary existence had received the name of Guy Fawkes, and amid a\ntumult of overwhelming acclamation a proposal was raised that I\nshould be carried around in triumph and afterwards initiated into\nthe observance of a time-honoured custom. Although it had now become\ndoubtful to what end the adventure was really tending, this person\nwould have submitted himself agreeably to the participation had not the\nblue-apparelled band cleft their way into the throng just as I was about\nto be borne off in triumph, and forming themselves into a ringed\nbarrier around me they presently succeeded in rearranging the contending\nelements and in restoring me to the society of my friends. To these\npersons they complained with somewhat unreasoning acrimony that I\nhad been exciting the inmates into a state of rebellion with wild\nimaginings, and for the first time I then began to understand that an\nimportant error had been perpetrated by some one, and that instead of\nbeing a meeting-place for those upholding the wisdom and authority\nof the country, the building was in reality an establishment for the\nmentally defective and those of treacherous instincts.\n\nFor some time after this occurrence I failed to regard the subject of\ndemons and allied Forces in any but a spirit of complete no enthusiasm,\nbut more recently my interest and research have been enlarged by the\nzeal and supernatural conversation of a liberal-minded person who\nsought my prosaic society with indefatigable persistence. When we had\nprogressed to such a length that the one might speak of affairs without\nthe other at once interposing that he himself had also unfortunately\ncome out quite destitute of money, this stranger, who revealed to me\nthat his name was Glidder, but that in the company of a certain chosen\nfew he was known intimately as the Keeper of the Salograma, approached\nme confidentially, and inquired whether we of our Central Kingdom were\nin the habit of receiving manifestations from the spirits of those who\nhad Passed Beyond.\n\nAt the unassumed ingenuousness of this remark I suffered my\nimpassiveness to relax, as I replied with well-established pride that\nalthough a country which neglected its ancestors might doubtless be\nable to produce more of the ordinary or graveyard spectres, we were\nunapproachable for the diverse forms and malignant enmity of our\napparitions. Of invisible beings alone, I continued tolerantly, we\nhad the distinction of being harassed by upwards of seven hundred\nclearly-defined varieties, while the commoner inflictions of demons,\nshades, visions, warlocks, phantoms, sprites, imps, phenomena, ghosts,\nand reflections passed almost without comment; and touching our admitted\nnational speciality of dragons, the honour of supremacy had never been\nquestioned.\n\nAt this, the agreeable person said that the pleasure he derived from\nmeeting me was all-excelling, and that I must certainly accompany him to\na meeting-place of this same chosen few the following evening, when,\nby the means of sacred expedients, they hoped to invoke the presence\nof some departed spirits, and perchance successfully raise a tangible\nvision or two. To so fair-minded a proposal I held myself acquiescently,\nand then inquired where the meeting-place in question was destined\nto be--whether in a ruined and abandoned sanctuary, or upon some\nprecipitous spot of desolation.\n\nThe inquiry was gracefully intended, but a passing cloud of unworthy\nannoyance revealed itself upon the upper part of the other's expression\nas he replied, \"We, the true seekers, despise theatrical accessories,\nand, as a matter of act, I couldn't well get away from the office in\ntime to go anywhere far. To-morrow we meet at my place in the Camden\nRoad. It's only a three-half-penny tram stage from the Euston and\nTottenham Court corner, so it couldn't be much more convenient for you.\"\nHe thereupon gave me an inscribed fragment of paper and mentioned the\nappointed hour.\n\n\"I'll tell you why I am particularly anxious for you to come to-morrow,\"\nhe said as we were each departing from one another. \"Pash--he's the\nReader of the Veda among us--and his people have got hold of a Greek\nwoman (they SAY she is a princess, of course), who can do a lot of\nthings with flowers and plate glass. They are bringing her for the first\ntime to-morrow, and it struck me that if I have YOU there already when\nthey arrive--you'll come in your national costume by the way?--it will\nbe a considerable set-off. Since his daughter was presented to the\nduchess at the opening of a bazaar, there has been no holding Pash; why\nhe was ever elected Reader of the Books, I don't know. Er--we have had\nscoffers sometimes, but I trust I may rely upon you not to laugh at\nanything you may not happen to agree with?\"\n\nWith conscientious dignity I replied that I had only really laughed\nseven times in my life, and therefore the entertainment was one which\nI was not likely to embark upon hastily or with inadequate cause. He\nimmediately expressed a seemly regret that the detail had been spoken,\nand again assuring him that at the stated hour I would present myself\nat the house bearing the symbol engraved upon the card, we definitely\nparted.\n\nThat, as a matter of fact, I did not so present myself at the exact\nhour, chiefly concerns the uncouth and arbitrary-minded charioteer who\ncontrolled the movements of the vehicle to which the one whom I was\nseeking had explicitly referred; for at an angle in the road he suffered\nthe horses to draw us aside into a path which did not correspond to the\nengraved signs upon the card, nor by any word of persuasion could he be\nprevailed upon to return.\n\nThus, without any possible reproach upon the manner in which I was\nconducting the enterprise, it came about that by the time I reached the\nspot indicated, all those persons who had been spoken of as constituting\na chosen band were assembled, and with them the barbarian princess.\nNevertheless, this person was irreproachably greeted, and the maiden\nindicated even spoke a few words to him in an outside tongue. Being\nnecessarily unacquainted with the import of the remark I spread out my\nhands with a sign of harmonious sympathy and smiled agreeably, whereat\nshe appeared to receive an added esteem from the faces of those around\n(excluding those directly of the House of Glidder), and was thereby\nencouraged to speak similarly at intervals, this person each time\nreplying in a like fashion.\n\n\"Is he then a Guide of the Way, also, princess?\" said the one Pash, who\nhad noted the occurrence; to which the maiden replied, \"To a degree, yet\nlacking the Innermost Mysteries.\"\n\nPresently it was announced that all things were fittingly prepared in\nanother chamber. Here, upon a table of polished wood, stood on the one\nside a round stone with certain markings, a group of inscribed books,\nand various other emblems; and on the other side a bowl of water, a\nsphere of crystal, pieces of unwritten parchment, and behind all, and at\na distance away, a sheet of transparent glass, greater in height than\nan ordinary person and as wide. When all were seated--the one who had\nenticed me among them placing himself before the stone, the person\nPash guarding the books, the barbarian princess being surrounded by her\nsymbols and alone in a self-imposed solitude, and the others at various\npoints--the lights were subdued and the appearances awaited.\n\nIt would scarcely be respectful, O my enlightened father, to take up\nyour well-spent leisure by a too prolific account of the matters which\nfollowed, they being in no way dissimilar from the manifestations\nby which the uninitiated little ones of Yuen-ping are wont to amuse\nthemselves and pass the winter evenings. From time to time harmonious\nsounds could be plainly detected, flowers and branches of wood were\nscattered sparsely here and there, persons claimed that passing objects\nhad touched their faces, and misshapen forms of smoke-like density\n(which some confidently recognised as the outlines of departed ones whom\nthey had known), revealed themselves against the glass. When this had\nbeen accomplished, the lights were recalled, and the barbarian maiden,\nsinking into a condition of languor, announced and foretold events and\nhappenings upon which she was consulted, sometimes replying by spoken\nwords, at others suffering her hand to trace them lightly upon the\nparchment sheets. Thus, to an inquirer it was announced that one, Aunt\nMary, in the Upper Air, was well and happy, though undeniably pained at\nthe action of Cousin William in the matter of the freehold houses, and\nmore than sceptical how his marriage would turn out. Another was advised\nthat although the interest on Consols was admittedly lower than that\nanticipated by those controlling the destines of a new venture entitled,\nThe Great Rosy Dawn Gold Mine Development Syndicate, and the name\ncertainly less poetically inspiring, the advising spirits were of the\nopinion that the former enterprise would prove the more stable of the\ntwo, and, in any case, they recommended the person in question to begin\nby placing not more than half of her life's savings into the mine.\nThe family of the House of Pash was assured that beneficent spirits\nsurrounded them at every turn, and that their good deeds were not\nsuffered to fall unfruitfully to the ground; while many bearing the name\nof Glidder, on the other hand, were reproved by one who had known them\nin infancy for the offences of jealousy, ostentation, vain thoughts,\nshallowness of character, and the like.\n\nAt length, revered, as there seemed to be no reasonable indication of\nany barbarian phantom of weight or authority appearing--nothing,\nindeed, beyond what a person in our country, of no admitted skill, would\naccomplish in the penetrating light of day with two others holding his\nhands, and a third reposing upon his head, I formed the perhaps immature\njudgment that the one to whom I was indebted for the entertainment would\nbe suffering a grievous frustration of his hopes and a diminution of his\noutward authority. Therefore, without sufficient consideration of the\nrestricted surroundings, as it afterwards appeared, I threw myself\ninto a retrospective vision, and floating unencumbered through space,\nI sought for Kwan Kiang-ti, the Demon of the Waters, upon whom I might\nfittingly call, as I was given into his keeping by the ceremony of\nspirit-adoption at an early age. Meeting an influence which I recognised\nto be an indication of his presence, in the vicinity of the Eighth\nRegion, I obsequiously entreated that he would reveal himself without\ndelay, and then, convinced of his sympathetic intervention, I suffered\nmy spirit to recall itself, and revived into the condition of an\nordinary existence.\n\n\"We have among us this evening, my friends,\" the one Pash was saying,\n\"a very remarkable lady--if I may use so democratic a term in the\nconnection--to whom the limits of Time and Space are empty words, and\nbefore whose supreme Will the most portentous Forces of Occult Nature\nmutely confess themselves her attending slaves--\" But at that moment\nthe rolling drums of Kiang-ti's thunder drowned his words, although he\nsubsequently raised his voice above it to entreat that any knives or\nother articles of a bright and attractive kind should at once be removed\nto a place of safety.\n\nHeralded by these continuous sounds, and accompanied by innumerable\nflashes of lightning, the genius presently manifested himself, leisurely\ndeveloping out of the air around. He appeared in his favourite guise of\nan upright dragon, his scales being arranged in rows of nine each way,\na pearl showing within his throat, and upon his head the wooden bar. The\nlights were extinguished incapably by the rain which fell continually in\nhis presence, but from his body there proceeded a luminous breath which\nsufficiently revealed the various incidents.\n\n\"Kong Ho,\" said this opportune vision, speaking with a voice like the\nbeating of a brass gong, \"the course you have adopted is an unusual one,\nbut the weight and regularity of your offerings have merit in my eyes.\nNevertheless, if your invocation is only the outcome of a shallow vanity\nor a profane love of display, nothing can save you from a painful death.\nSpeak now, fully and without evasion, and fear nothing.\"\n\n\"Amiable Being,\" said this person, kow-towing profoundly, \"the matter\nwas designed to the end only that your incomparable versatility might\nbe fittingly displayed. These barbarians sought vainly to raise phantoms\ncapable of any useful purpose, whereupon I, jealous of your superior\nomnipotence, judged it would be an unseemly neglect not to inform you of\nthe opportunity.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said the demon affably. \"All doubt in the matter shall\nnow be set at rest. Could any more convincing act be found than that\nI should breath upon these barbarians and reduce them instantly to a\nscattering of thin white ashes?\"\n\n\"Assuredly it would be a conclusive testimony,\" I replied; \"yet in\nthat case consider how inadequate a witness could be borne to your\nenlightened condescension, when none would be left but one to whom the\nspoken language of this Island is more in the nature of a trap than a\ncomfortable vehicle.\"\n\n\"Your reasoning is profound, Kong Ho,\" he replied, \"yet abundant\nproof shall not be wanting.\" With these words he raised his hand, and\nimmediately the air became filled with an overwhelming shower of\nthose productions with which Kwan Kiang-ti's name is chiefly\nassociated--shells and pebbles of all kinds, lotus and other roots from\nthe river banks, weeds from seas of greater depths, fish of interminable\nvariety from both fresh and bitter waters, all falling in really\nembarrassing abundance, and mingled with an incessant rain of sand and\nwater. In the midst of this the demon suddenly passed away, striking the\ntable as he went, so that it was scarred with the brand of a five-clawed\nhand, shattering all the objects upon it (excepting the stone and\nthe books, which he doubtless regarded as sacred to some extent), and\nleaving the room involved in a profound darkness.\n\n\"For the love av the saints--for the love av the saints, save us from\nthe yellow devils!\" exclaimed a voice from the spot where last the\nbarbarian princess had reclined, and upon this person going to her\nassistance with lights it was presently revealed that she alone had\nremained seated, the others having all assembled themselves beneath the\ntable in spite of the incapability of the space at their disposal. Most\nof the weightier evidences of Kwan Kiang-ti's majestic presence had\nfaded away, though the table retained the print of his impressive hand,\nmany objects remained irretrievably torn apart, and in a distant corner\nof the room an insignificant heap of shells and seaweed still lingered.\nFrom the floor covering a sprinkling of the purest Fuh-chow sand rose\nat every step, the salt dew of the Tung-Hai still dropped from\nthe surroundings, and, at a later period, a shore crab was found\nendeavouring to make its escape undetected.\n\nConvinced that the success of the manifestation would have enlarged\nthe one Glidder's esteem towards me to an inexpressible degree, I now\napproached him with words of self-deprecation ready on my tongue, but\nbefore he spoke I became aware, from the nature of his glance, that\nthe provision had been unnecessary, for already his face had begun to\nassume, to a most distended amount, the expression which I had long\nrecognised as a synonym that some detail had been regarded at a\ndifferent angle from that anticipated.\n\n\"May I ask,\" he began in a somewhat heavily-laden voice, after he had\nassured himself that the person who was speaking was himself, and his\nexternal attributes unchanged, \"May I ask, sir\" (and at this title,\nwhich is untranslatable in its many-sided significance when technically\nemployed, I recognised that all complimentary intercourse might be\nregarded as having closed), \"whether you accept the responsibility of\nthese proceedings?\"\n\n\"Touching the appearance which has so essentially contributed to the\nsuccess of the occasion, it is undeniably due to this one's foresight,\"\nI replied modestly.\n\n\"Then let me tell you, sir, that I consider it an outrage--a dastardly\noutrage.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" protested this person with retiring assertiveness, \"the expressed\nobject of the ceremony, as it stood before my intelligence, was for the\nset purpose of invoking spirits and raising certain visions.\"\n\n\"Spirits!\" exclaimed the one before me with an accent of concentrated\naversion; \"yes, spirits; impalpable, civilised, genuine spirits, who\nmanifest themselves through recognised media, and are conformable to the\nusages of the best drawing-room society--yes. But not demons, sir; not\nChinese devils in the Camden Road--no. Truth and Light at any cost, not\npaganism. It's perfectly scandalous. Look at the mahogany table--ruined;\nlook at the wall-paper--conventional mackerels with a fishing-net\nbackground, new this spring--soused; look at the Brussels carpet,\nseventeen six by twenty-five--saturated!\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you, Mr. Glidder,\" here interposed the individual\nPash. \"I was watching you, sir, closely the whole time, and I have my\nsuspicions about how it was done. I don't know whether Mr. Glidder\nhas any legal redress, but I should certainly advise him to see his\nsolicitors to-morrow, and in the meantime--\"\n\n\"He is my guest,\" exclaimed the one whose hospitality I was enjoying,\n\"and while he is beneath my roof he is sacred.\"\n\n\"But I do not think that it would be kind to detain him any longer in\nhis wet things,\" said another of the household, with pointed malignity,\nand accepting this as an omen of departure, I withdrew myself, bowing\nrepeatedly, but offering no closer cordiality.\n\n\"Through a torn sleeve one drops a purse of gold,\" it is well said; and\nas if to prove to a deeper end that misfortune is ever double-handed,\nthis incapable being, involved in thoughts of funereal density, bent\nhis footsteps to an inaccurate turning, and after much wandering was\ncompelled to pass the night upon a desolate heath--but that would be the\nmatter of another narrative.\n\nWith an insidious doubt whether, after all, the far-seeing Kwan\nKiang-ti's first impulse would not have been the most satisfactory\nconclusion to the enterprise.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VII\n\n\n Concerning warfare, both as waged by ourselves and by a\n nation devoid of true civilisation. The aged man and the\n meeting and the parting of our ways. The instance of the one\n who expressed emotion by leaping.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--You are omniscient, but I cannot regard the fear which\nyou express in your beautifully-written letter, bearing the sign of the\neleventh day of the seventh moon, as anything more than the imaginings\nprompted by a too-lavish supper of your favourite shark's fin and peanut\noil. Unless the dexterously-elusive attributes of the genial-spoken\npersons high in office at Pekin have deteriorated contemptibly\nsince this one's departure, it is quite impossible for our great\nand enlightened Empire to be drawn into a conflict with the northern\nbarbarians whom you indicate, against our will. When the matter becomes\nurgent, doubtless a prince of the Imperial line will loyally suffer\nhimself to Pass Above, and during the period of ceremonial mourning\nfor so pure and exalted an official it would indeed be an unseemly\ndesecration to engage in any public business. If this failed, and an\nultimatum were pressed with truly savage contempt for all that is sacred\nand refined, it might be well next to consider the health even of the\nsublime Emperor himself (or, perhaps better, that of the select and\never-present Dowager Empress); but should the barbarians still advance,\nand, setting the usages of civilised warfare at defiance, threaten an\nengagement in the midst of this unparalleled calamity, there will be no\nalternative but to have a formidable rebellion in the Capital. All\nthe barbarian powers will then assemble as usual, and in the general\ninvolvement none dare move alone, and everything will have to be\nregarded as being put back to where it was before. It is well said, \"The\nbroken vessel can never be made whole, but it may be delicately arranged\nso that another shall displace it.\"\n\nThese barbarians, less resourceful in device, have only recently emerged\nfrom a conflict into which they do not hesitate to admit they were drawn\ndespite their protests. Such incompetence is characteristic of their\nmethods throughout. Not in any way disguising their purpose, they\nat once sent out an army of those whom could be the readiest seized,\ncertainly furnishing them with weapons, charms to use in case of\nemergency, and three-coloured standards (their adversaries adopting\na white banner to symbolise the conciliation of their attitude, and\ndisplaying both freely in every extremity), but utterly neglecting to\nteach them the arts of painting their bodies with awe-inspiring forms,\nof imitating the cries of wild animals as they attacked, of clashing\ntheir weapons together with menacing vigour, or any of the recognised\nartifices by which terror may be struck into the ranks of an awaiting\nfoeman. The result was that which the prudent must have foreseen. The\nmore accomplished enemy, without exposing themselves to any unnecessary\ninconvenience, gained many advantages by their intrepid power of\ndissimulation--arranging their garments and positions in such a way that\nthey had the appearance of attacking when in reality they were effecting\na prudent retreat; rapidly concealing themselves among the earth on the\napproach of an overwhelming force; becoming openly possessed with the\nprophetic vision of an assured final victory whenever it could be no\nlonger concealed that matters were becoming very desperate indeed; and\ngaining an effective respite when all other ways of extrication were\nbarred against them by the stratagem of feigning that they were other\nthan those whom they had at first appeared to be.\n\nIn the meantime the adventure was not progressing pleasantly for those\nchiefly concerned at home. With the earliest tidings of repulse it was\ndiscovered that in the haste of embarkation the wrong persons had been\nsent, all those who were really the fittest to command remaining behind,\nand many of these did not hesitate to write to the printed papers,\nresolutely admitting that they themselves were in every way better\nqualified to bring the expedition to a successful end, at the same time\nskilfully pointing out how the disasters which those in the field\nhad incurred could easily have been avoided by acting in a precisely\ncontrary manner.\n\nIn the emergency the most far-seeing recommended a more unbending policy\nof extermination. Among these, one in particular, a statesman bearing\nan illustrious name of two-edged import, distinguished himself by the\nliberal broad-mindedness of his opinions, and for the time he even did\nnot flinch from making himself excessively unpopular by the wide\nand sweeping variety of his censure. \"We are confessedly a barbarian\nnation,\" fearlessly declared this unprejudiced person (who, although\nentitled by hereditary right to carry a banner on the field of battle,\nwith patriotic self-effacement preferred to remain at home and encourage\nthose who were fighting by pointing out their inadequacy to the task and\nthe extreme unlikelihood of their ever accomplishing it), \"and in order\nto achieve our purpose speedily it is necessary to resort to the methods\nof barbarism.\" The most effective measure, as he proceeded to explain\nwith well-thought-out detail, would be to capture all those least\ncapable of resistance, concentrate them into a given camp, and then\nat an agreed signal reduce the entire assembly to what he termed, in\na passage of high-minded eloquence, \"a smoking hecatomb of women and\nchildren.\"\n\nHis advice was pointed with a crafty insight, for not only would such a\ncourse have brought the stubborn enemy to a realisation of the weakness\nof their position and thus paved the way to a dignified peace, but by\nthe act itself few would have been left to hand down the tradition of\na relentless antagonism. Yet with incredible obtuseness his advice was\nignored and he himself was referred to at the time by those who regarded\nthe matter from a different angle, with a scarcely-veiled dislike, which\ntowards many of his followers took the form of building materials and\nother dissentient messages whenever they attempted to raise their voices\npublicly. As an inevitable result the conquest of the country took\nyears, where it would have been moons had the more truly humane policy\nbeen adopted, commerce and the arts languished, and in the end so little\nspoil was taken that it was more common to meet six mendicants wearing\nthe honourable embellishment of the campaign than to see one captured\nslave maiden offered for sale in the market places--indeed, even to this\nday the deficiency is clearly admitted and openly referred to as The\nGreat \"Domestic\" Problem.\n\nAt various times during my residence here I have been filled with a\nmost acute gratification when the words of those around have seemed to\nindicate that they recognised the undoubted superiority of the laws and\ninstitutions of our enlightened country. Sometimes, it is true, upon a\nmore detailed investigation of the incident, it has presently appeared\nthat either I had misunderstood the exact nature of their sentiments\nor they had slow-wittedly failed to grasp the precise operation of the\nenactment I had described; but these exceptions are clearly the outcome\nof their superficial training, and do not affect the fact my feeble and\nfrequently even eccentric arguments are at length certainly moving the\nmore intelligent into an admission of what constitutes true justice\nand refinement. It is not to be denied that here and there exists a\nprejudice against our customs even in the minds of the studious; but as\nthis is invariably the shadow of misconception, it has frequently been\nmy sympathetic privilege to promote harmony by means of the inexorable\nlogic of fact and reason. \"But are not your officials uncompromisingly\nopposed to the freedom of the Press?\" said one who conversed with me on\nthe varying phases of the two countries, and knowing that in his eyes\nthis would constitute an unendurable offence, I at once appeased his\nmind. \"By no means,\" I replied; \"if anything, the exact contrary is\nthe case. As a matter of reality, of course, there is no Press now, the\nall-seeing Board of Censors having wisely determined that it was not\nstimulating to the public welfare; but if such an institution was\npermitted to exist you may rest genially assured that nothing could\nexceed the lenient toleration which all in office would extend towards\nit.\" A similar instance of malicious inaccuracy is widely spoken of\nregarding our lesser ones. \"Is it really a fact, Mr. Kong,\" exclaimed a\nmaiden of magnanimous condescension, to this person recently, \"that\nwe poor women are despised in your country, and that among the\nworking-classes female children are even systematically abandoned as\nsoon as they are born?\" Suffering my features to express amusement at\nthis unending calumny, I indicated my violent contempt towards the one\nwho had first uttered it. \"So far from despising them,\" I continued,\nwith ingratiating gallantry, \"we recognise that they are quite necessary\nfor the purposes of preparing our food, carrying weighty burdens,\nand the like; and how grotesque an action would it be for poor but\naffectionate parents to abandon one who in a few years' time could be\nsold at a really remunerative profit, this, indeed, being the principal\nmeans of sustenance in many frugal families.\"\n\nOn another occasion I had seated myself upon a wooden couch in one\nof the open spaces about the outskirts of the city, when an aged man\nchanced to pass by. Him I saluted with ceremonious politeness, on\naccount of his years and the venerable dignity of his beard. Thereupon\nhe approached near, and remarking affably that the afternoon was good\n(though, to use no subtle evasion, it was very evil), he congenially sat\nby my side and entered into familiar discourse.\n\n\"They say that in your part of the world we old grandfathers are\nworshipped,\" he said, after recounting to my ears all the most intimate\ndetails of his existence from his youth upwards; \"now, might that be\nright?\"\n\n\"Truly,\" I replied. \"It is the unchanging foundation of our system of\nmorality.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" he admitted pleasantly. \"We are a long way behind them\nforeigners in everything. At the rate we're going there won't be any\ntrade nor work nor religion left in this country in another twenty\nyears. I often wish I had gone abroad when I was younger. And if I\nhad chanced upon your parts I should be worshipped, eh?\" and at the\nagreeable thought the aged man laughed in his throat with simple humour.\n\n\"Assuredly,\" I replied; \"--after you were dead.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" exclaimed the venerable person, checking the fountain of his mirth\nabruptly at the word. \"Dead! not before? Doesn't--doesn't that seem a\nbit of a waste?\"\n\n\"Such has been the observance from the time of unrecorded antiquity,\" I\nreplied. \"'Obey parents, respect the old, loyally uphold the sovereign,\nand worship ancestors.'\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" remarked the one beside me, \"obedience and respect--that's\nsomething nowadays. And you make them do it?\"\n\n\"Our laws are unflinching in their application,\" I said. \"No crime is\nheld to be more detestable than disrespect of those to whom we owe our\nexistence.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" he agreed, \"it's a pleasure to hear it. It must be a\ngreat country, yours; a country with a future, I should say. Now, about\nthat youngest lad of my son Henry's--the one that drops pet lizards down\nmy neck, and threatened to put rat poison into his mother's tea when she\nwouldn't take him to the Military Turneyment; what would they do to him\nby your laws?\"\n\n\"If the assertion were well sustained by competent witnesses,\" I\nreplied, \"it would probably be judged so execrable an offence, that\na new punishment would have to be contrived. Failing that, he would\ncertainly be wrapped round from head to foot in red-hot chains, and thus\nexposed to public derision.\"\n\n\"Ah, red-hot chains!\" said the aged person, as though the words formed a\npleasurable taste upon his palate. \"The young beggar! Well, he'd deserve\nit.\"\n\n\"Furthermore,\" I continued, gratified at having found one who so\nintelligently appreciated the deficiencies of his own country and the\nunblemished perfection of ours, \"his parents and immediate descendants,\nif any should exist, would be submitted to a fate as inevitable but\nslightly less contemptuous--slow compression, perchance; his parents\nonce removed (thus enclosing your venerable personality), and remoter\noffsprings would be merely put to the sword without further ignominy,\nand those of less kinship to about the fourth degree would doubtless\nescape with branding and a reprimand.\"\n\n\"Lordelpus!\" exclaimed the patriarchal one, hastily leaping to the\nextreme limit of the wooden couch, and grasping his staff into a\nsignificant attitude of defence; \"what's that for?\"\n\n\"Our system of justice is all-embracing,\" I explained. \"It is reasonably\nheld that in such a case either that there is an inherent strain of\ncriminality which must be eradicated at all hazard, or else that those\nwho are responsible for the virtuous instruction of the young have been\ngrossly neglectful of their duty. Whichever is the true cause, by this\nunfailing method we reach the desired end, for, as our proverb aptly\nsays, 'Do the wise pluck the weed and leave the roots to spread?'\"\n\n\"It's butchery, nothing short of Smithfield,\" said the ancient person\ndefinitely, rising and moving to a more remote distance as he spoke the\nwords, yet never for a moment relaxing the aggressive angle at which\nhe thrust out his staff before him. \"You're a bloodthirsty race in my\nopinion, and when they get this door open in China that there's so much\ntalk about, out you go through it, my lad, or old England will know\nwhy.\" With this narrow-minded imprecation on his lips he left me, not\neven permitting me to continue expounding what would be the most likely\nsentences meted out to the witnesses in the case, the dwellers of the\nsame street, and the members of the household with whom the youth in\nquestion had contemplated forming an alliance.\n\nAmong the many contradictions which really almost seem purposely\narranged to entrap the unwary in this strangely under-side-up country,\nis the fact that while the ennobled and those of high official rank are\ncourteous in their attitude and urbane--frequently even to the extent\nof refusing money from those whom they have obliged, no matter how\nprivately pressed upon them--the low-caste and slavish are not only\ndeficient in obsequiousness, but are permitted to retort openly to those\nwho address them with fitting dignity. Here such a state of things\nis too general to excite remark, but as instances are well called the\nflowers of the tree of assertion, this person will set forth the manner\nin which he was contumaciously opposed by an oblique-eyed outcast who\nattended within the stall of one selling wrought gold, jewels, and\nmerchandise of the finer sort.\n\nBeing desirous of procuring a gift wherewith to propitiate a certain\nmaiden's esteem, and seeing above a shop of varied attraction a\nsuspended sign emblematic of three times repeated gild abundance I drew\nnear, not doubting to find beneath so auspicious a token the fulfilment\nof an honourable accommodation. Inside the window was displayed one\nof the implements by which the various details of a garment are joined\ntogether upon turning a wheel, hung about with an inscription setting\nforth that it was esteemed at the price of two units of gold, nineteen\npieces of silver, and eleven and three-quarters of the brass cash of the\nland, and judging that no more suitable object could be procured for the\npurpose, I entered the shop, and desired the attending slave to submit\nit to my closer scrutiny.\n\n\"Behold,\" I exclaimed, when I had made a feint of setting the device\ninto motion (for it need not be concealed from you, O discreet one, that\nI was really inadequate to the attempt, and, indeed, narrowly escaped\nimpaling myself upon its sudden and unexpected protrusions), \"the\nhighly-burnished surface of your dexterously arranged window gave to\nthis engine a rich attractiveness which is altogether lacking at a\ncloser examination. Nevertheless, this person will not recede from a\nperhaps too impulsive offer of one unit of gold, three pieces of silver,\nand four and a half brass cash,\" my object, of course, being that after\nthe mutual recrimination of disparagement and over-praise we should in\nthe length of an hour or two reach a becoming compromise in the middle\ndistance.\n\n\"Well,\" responded the menial one, regarding me with an expression in\nwhich he did not even attempt to subdue the baser emotions, \"you HAVE\ncome a long way for nothing\"; and he made a pretence of wishing to\nreplace the object.\n\n\"Yet,\" I continued, \"observe with calm impartiality how insidiously the\nrust has assailed the outer polish of the lacquer; perceive here upon\nthe beneath part of wood the ineffaceable depression of a deeply-pointed\nblow; note well the--\"\n\n\"It was good enough for you to want me to muck up out of the window,\nwasn't it?\" demanded the obstinate barbarian, becoming passionate in his\nbearing rather than reluctantly, but with courteous grace, lessening the\nprice to a trifling degree, as we regard the proper way of carrying on\nthe enterprise.\n\n\"It is well said,\" I admitted, hoping that he might yet learn wisdom\nfrom my attitude of unruffled urbanity, though I feared that his angle\nof negotiating was unconquerably opposed to mine, \"but now its many\nimperfections are revealed. The inelegance of its outline, the grossness\nof the applied colours, the unlucky combination of numbers engraved upon\nthis plate, the--\"\n\n\"Damme!\" cried the utterly perverse rebel standing opposite, \"why don't\nyou keep on your Compound, you Yellow Peril? Who asked you to come into\nmy shop to blackguard the things? Come now, who did?\"\n\n\"Assuredly it is your place of commerce,\" I replied cheerfully,\npreparing to bring forward an argument, which in our country never fails\nto shake the most stubborn, \"yet bend your eyes to the fact that at no\ngreat distance away there stands another and a more alluring stall of\nmerchandise where--\"\n\n\"Go to it then!\" screamed the abandoned outcast, leaping over his\ncounter and shouting aloud in a frenzy of uncontrollable rage. \"Clear\nout, or I'll bend my feet--\" but concluding at this point that some\nprivate calumny from which he was doubtless suffering was disturbing\nhis mind to so great an extent that there was little likelihood of\nour bringing the transaction to a profitable end, I left the shop\nimmediately but with befitting dignity.\n\nWith a fell-founded assurance that you will now be acquiring a really\nprecise and bird's-eye-like insight into practically all phases of this\ncountry.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VIII\n\n\n Concerning the wisdom of the sublime Wei Chung and its\n application to the ordinary problems of existence. The\n meeting of three, hitherto unknown to each other, about a\n wayside inn, and their various manners of conducting the\n enterprise.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--You will doubtless remember the behaviour of the aged\nphilosopher Wei Chung, when commanded by the broad-minded emperor of his\ntime to reveal the hidden sources of his illimitable knowledge, so\nthat all might freely acquire, and the race thereby become raised to a\nposition of unparalleled excellence. Taking the well-disposed sovereign\nfamiliarly by the arm, Wei Chung led him to the mouth of his cave in the\nforest, and, standing by his side, bade him reflect with open eyes for\na short space of time, and then express aloud what he had seen. \"Nothing\nof grave import,\" declared the emperor when the period was accomplished;\n\"only the trees shaken by the breeze.\" \"It is enough,\" replied Wei\nChung. \"What, to the adroitly-balanced mind, does such a sight\nreveal?\" \"That it is certainly a windy day,\" exclaimed the omnipotent\ntriumphantly, for although admittedly divine, he yet lacked the\nphilosopher's discrimination. \"On the contrary,\" replied the sage\ncoldly, \"that is the natural pronouncement of the rankly superficial. To\nthe highly-trained intellect it conveys the more subtle truth that the\nwind affects the trees, and not the trees affect the wind. For upwards\nof seventy years this one has daily stood at the door of his cave for\na brief period, and regularly garnering a single detail of like\nbrilliance, has made it the well-spring for a day's reflection. As the\nresult he now has by heart upwards of twenty-five thousand useful facts,\nall serviceable for original proverbs, and an encyclopaedic mind\nwhich would enable him to take a high place in a popular competition\nunassisted by a single work of reference.\" Much impressed by the\nadventure the charitably-inclined emperor presented Wei Chung with an\nonyx crown (which the philosopher at once threw into an adjacent well),\nand returning to his capital published a decree that each day at\nsunrise every person should stand at the door of his dwelling, and after\nobserving for a period, compare among themselves the details of their\nthoughts. By this means he hoped to achieve his imperial purpose, but\nalthough the literal part of the enactment is scrupulously maintained,\nespecially by the slothful and defamatory, who may be seen standing\nat their doors and conversing together even to this day, from some\nunforeseen imperfection the intellectual capacity of the race has\nremained exactly as it was before.\n\nNevertheless it is not to be questioned that the system of the versatile\nWei Chung was, in itself, grounded upon a far-seeing accuracy, and\nas the need of such a rational observation is deepened among the\ninconsistencies and fantastic customs of a barbarian race, I have made\nit a useful habit to accept as a guide for the day's behaviour the\nreflections engendered by the first noteworthy incident of the morning.\n\nUpon the day with which this letter concerns itself I had set forth, in\naccordance with an ever-present desire, to explore some of the hidden\nplaces of the city. At the time a tempest of great ferocity was raging,\nand bending my head before it I had the distinction of coming into\ncontact with a person of ill-endowed exterior at an angle where two\nreads met. This amiable wayfarer exchanged civilities with me after the\npoliteness characteristic of the labouring classes towards those who\ndiffer from them in speech, dress, or colour: that is to say, he filled\nhis pipe from my proffered store, and after lighting it threw the match\ninto my face, and passed on with an appropriate remark.\n\nDoubtless this insignificant occurrence would have faded without\ninternal comment if the penetrating Wei Chung had never existed, but\nnow, guided by his sublime precedent, I arranged the incident for the\nday's conduct under three reflective heads.\n\nIt was while I was meditating on the second of these that an exclamation\ncaused me to turn, when I observed a prosperously-outlined person in\nthe act of picking up a scrip which had the appearance of being lavishly\ndistended with pieces of gold.\n\n\"If I had not seen you pass it, I should have opined that this hyer\nwallet belonged to you,\" remarked the justice-loving stranger (for\nthe incident had irresistibly retarded my own footsteps), speaking\nthe language of this land, but with an accent of penetrating harmony\nhitherto unknown to my ears. With these auspicious words he turned over\nthe object upon his hand doubtfully.\n\n\"So entrancing a possibility is, as you gracefully suggest, of\nunavoidable denial,\" I replied. \"Nevertheless, this person will not\nhesitate to join his acclamation with yours; for, as the Book of Verses\nwisely says, 'Even the blind, if truly polite, will extol the prospect\nfrom your house-top.'\"\n\n\"That's so,\" admitted the one by my side. \"But I don't know that there\nis any call for a special thanksgiving. As I happen to have more\nmoney of my own than I can reasonably spend I shall drop this in at a\nconvenient police station. I dare say some poor critter is pining away\nfor it now.\"\n\nPleasantly impressed by the resolute benevolence of the one who had\na greater store of wealth than he could, by his own unaided efforts,\ndispose of, I arranged myself unobtrusively at his side, and maintaining\nan exhibition of my most polished and genial conversation, I sought to\npenetrate deeply into his esteem.\n\n\"Gaze in this direction, Kong,\" he said at length, calling me by name\nwith auspicious familiarity; \"I am a benighted stranger in this hyer\ncity, and so are you, I rek'n. Suppose we liquor up, and then take a few\nof the side shows together.\"\n\n\"The suggestion is one against which I will erect no ill-disposed\nbarrier,\" I at once replied, so inflexibly determined not to lose sight\nof a person possessing such engaging attributes as to be cheerfully\nprepared even to consume my rice spirit in the inverted position which\nhis words implied if the display was persisted in. \"Nevertheless,\"\nI added, with a resourceful prudence, \"although by no means\nundistinguished among the highest literary and competitive circles of\nhis native Yuen-ping, the one before you is incapable of walking in the\nfootsteps of a person whose accumulations are greater than he himself\ncan appreciably diminish.\"\n\n\"That's all right, Kong,\" exclaimed the one whom my last words fittingly\ndescribed, striking the recess of his lower garment with a gesture of\ngraceful significance. \"When I take a fancy to any one it isn't a matter\nof dollars. I usually carry a trifle of five hundred or a thousand\npounds in my pocket-book, and if we can get through that--why, there's\nplenty more waiting at the bank. Say, though, I hope you don't keep much\nabout you; it isn't really safe.\"\n\n\"The temptation to do so is one which this person has hitherto\nsuccessfully evaded,\" I replied. \"The contents of this reptile-skin\ncase\"--and not to be outshone in mutual confidence I here displayed it\nopenly--\"do not exceed nine or ten pieces of gold and a like number of\nprinted obligations promising to pay five pieces each.\"\n\n\"Put it away, Kong,\" he said resolutely. \"You won't need that so long as\nyou're with me. Well, now, what sort of a saloon have we here?\"\n\nAs far as the opinion might be superficially expressed it had every\nindication of being one of noteworthy antiquity, and to the innately\nmodest mind its unassuming diffidence might have lent an added charm.\nNevertheless, on most occasions this person would have maintained\nan unshaken dexterity in avoiding its open door, but as the choice\nadmittedly lay in the hands of one who carried five hundred or a\nthousand pieces of gold we went in together and passed through to a\ncompartment of retiring seclusion.\n\nIn our own land, O my orthodox-minded father, where the unfailing\nresources of innumerable bands of dragons, spirits, vampires, ghouls,\nshadows, omens, and thunderstorms are daily enlisted to carry into\neffect the pronouncements of an appointed destiny, we have many\nhistorical examples of the inexorably converging legs of coincidence,\nbut none, I think, more impressively arranged than the one now\ndescending this person's brush.\n\nWe had scarcely reposed ourselves, and taken from the hands of an\nawaiting slave the vessels of thrice-potent liquid which in this Island\nis regarded as the indispensable accompaniment to every movement of\nexistence, when a third person entered the room, and seating himself\nat a table some slightly removed distance away, lowered his head and\nabandoned himself to a display of most lavish dejection.\n\n\"That poor cuss doesn't appear to be holiday-making,\" remarked the\nsincerely-compassionate person at my side, after closely observing the\nother for a period; and then, moved by the overpowering munificence of\nhis inward nature, he called aloud, \"Say, stranger, you seem to have\ngot it thickly in the neck. Is it family affliction or the whisky of the\nestablishment?\"\n\nAt these affably-intentioned words the stranger raised his eyes quickly,\nwith an indication of not having up to that time been aware of our\npresence.\n\n\"Sir,\" he exclaimed, approaching to a spot where he could converse\nwith a more enhanced facility, \"when I loosened the restraint of an\noverpowering if unmanly grief, I imagined that I was alone, for I\nwould have shunned even the most flattering sympathy, but your\ncharitably-modulated voice invites confidence. The one before you is the\nmost contemptible, left-handed, and disqualified outcast in creation,\nand he is now making his way towards the river, while his widow will be\nleft to take in washing, his infant son to vend evening printed leaves,\nand his graceful and hitherto highly secluded daughters to go upon the\nstage.\"\n\n\"Say, stranger,\" interposed this person, by no means unwilling to\nengrave upon his memory this newly-acquired form of greeting, \"the\nemotion is doubtless all-pressing, but in my ornate and flower-laden\ntongue we have a salutation, 'Slowly, slowly; walk slowly,' which seems\nto be of far-seeing application.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" remarked the one by my side. \"Separate it with the teeth,\ninch by inch.\"\n\n\"I will be calm, then,\" continued the other (who, to avoid the\ncomplication of the intermingling circumstances, may be described as\nthe more stranger of the two), and he took of his neckcloth. \"I am a\nmerchant in tea, yellow fat, and mixed spices, in a small but hitherto\nsatisfactory way.\" Thus revealing himself, he continued to set forth\nhow at an earlier hour he had started on a journey to deposit his wealth\n(doubtless as a propitiation of outraged deities) upon a certain bank,\nand how, upon reaching the specified point, he discovered that what\nhe carried had eluded his vigilance. \"All gone: notes, gold, and\npocket-book--the savings of a lifetime,\" concluded the ill-omened one,\nand at the recollection a sudden and even more highly-sustained frenzy\nof self-unpopularity involving him, without a pause he addressed himself\nby seven and twenty insulting expressions, many of which were quite new\nto my understanding.\n\nAt the earliest mention of the details affecting the loss, the elbow of\nthe person who had made himself responsible for the financial obligation\nof the day propelled itself against my middle part, and unseen by the\nother he indicated to me by means of his features that the entertainment\nwas becoming one of agreeable prepossession.\n\n\"Now, touching this hyer wallet,\" he said presently. \"How might you\ndescribe it?\"\n\n\"In colour it was red, and within were two compartments, the one\ncontaining three score notes each of ten pounds, the other fifty pounds\nof gold. But what's the use of describing it? Some lucky demon will pick\nit up and pocket the lot, and I shall never see a cent of it again.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better consult one who reburnishes the eyes,\" declared the\nmagnanimous one with a laugh, and drawing forth the article referred to\nhe cast it towards the merchant in a small way.\n\nAt this point of the narrative my thoroughly incompetent brush confesses\nthe proportions of the requirement to be beyond its most extended\nlimit, and many very honourable details are necessarily left without\nexpression.\n\n\"I've known men of all sorts, good, bad, and bothwise,\" exclaimed the\none who had recovered his possessions; \"but I never thought to meet\na gent as would hand over six hundred and fifty pounds as if it was a\ntoothpick. Sir, it overbalances me; it does, indeed.\"\n\n\"Say no more about it,\" urged the first person, and to suggest\ngracefully that the incident had reached its furthest extremity, he\nbegan to set out the melody of an unspoken verse.\n\n\"I will say no more, then,\" he replied; \"but you cannot reasonably\nprevent my doing something to express my gratitude. If you are not too\nproud you will come and partake of food and wine with me beneath the\nsign of the Funereal Male Cow, and to show my confidence in you I shall\ninsist upon you carrying my pocket-book.\"\n\nThe person whom I had first encountered suffered his face to become\nexcessively amused. \"Say, stranger, do you take me for a pack-mule?\"\nhe replied good-naturedly. \"I already have about as much as I want to\nhandle. Never mind; we'll come along with you, and Mr. Kong shall carry\nyour bullion.\"\n\nAt this delicate and high-minded proposal a rapid change, in no way\ncomplimentary to my explicit habit of adequately conducting any venture\nupon which I may be engaged, came over the face of the second person.\n\n\"Sir,\" he exclaimed, \"I have nothing to say against this gentleman, but\nI am under no obligation to him, and I don't see why I should trust him\nwith everything I possess.\"\n\n\"Stranger,\" exclaimed the other rising to his feet (and from this point\nit must be understood that the various details succeeded one another\nwith a really agile dexterity), \"let me tell you that Mr. Kong is my\nfriend, and that ought to be enough.\"\n\n\"It is. If you say this gentleman is your friend, and that you have\nknown him long and intimately enough to be able to answer for him,\nthat's good enough for me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" admitted the first person, and I could not conceal from myself\nthat his tone was inauspiciously reluctant, \"I can't exactly say that\nI've known him long; in fact I only met him half an hour ago. But I have\nthe fullest confidence in his integrity.\"\n\n\"It's just as I expected. Well, sir, you're good-natured enough for\nanything, but if you'll excuse me, I must say that you're a small piece\nof an earthenware vessel after all\"--the veiled allusion doubtlessly\nbeing that the vessel of necessity being broken, the contents inevitably\nescape--\"and I hope you're not being had.\"\n\n\"I'm not, and I'll prove it before we go out together,\" retorted the\nengaging one, who had in the meantime become so actively impetuous on my\naccount, that he did not remain content with the spoken words, but threw\nthe various belongings about as he mentioned them in a really profuse\ndisplay of inimitable vehemence. \"Here, Kong, take this hyer pocket-book\nwhatever he says. Now on the top of that take everything I've got, and\nyou know what THAT figures up to. Now give this gentleman your little\nlot to keep him quiet; I don't ask for anything. Now, stranger, I'm\nready. You and I will take a stroll round the block and back again, and\nif Mr. Kong isn't waiting here for us when we return with everything\nintact and O.K., I'll double your deposit and never trust a durned soul\nagain.\"\n\nNodding genially over his shoulder with a harmonious understanding,\nexpressive of the fact that we were embarking upon an undeniably\ndiverting episode, the benevolent-souled person who had accumulated more\nriches than he was competent to melt away himself, passed out, urging\nthe doubtful and still protesting one before him.\n\nThus abandoned to my own reflections, I pondered for a short time\nprofitably on the third head of the day's meditation (Touching the match\nand this person's unattractively-lined face. The revealed truth: the\ninexperienced sheep cannot pass through the hedge without leaving\nportions of his wool), and then finding the philosophy of Wei Chung very\ngood, I determined to remove the superfluous apprehensions of the vender\nof food-stuffs with less delay by setting out and meeting them on their\nreturn.\n\nA few paces distant from the door, one of the ever-present watchers of\nthe street was standing, watching the street with unremitting vigilance,\nwhile from the well-guarded expression of his face it might nevertheless\nbe gathered that he stood as though in expectation.\n\n\"Prosperity,\" I said, with seasonable greeting. (For no excess of\nconsideration is too great to be lavished upon these, who unite\nwithin themselves the courage of a high warrior, the expertness of a\nthree-handed magician, and the courtesy of a genial mandarin.) \"I\nseek two, apparelled thus and thus. Did you, by any chance, mark the\ndirection of their footsteps?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, regarding this person with a most flattering application,\n\"YOU seek them, do you? Well, they've just gone off in a hansom, and\nthey'll want a lot of seeking for the next week or two. You let them\ncarry your purse, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" I replied. \"As a mark of confidence; this person, for his\npart, receiving a like token at their hands.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said the official watcher, conveying into his voice a\nsubtle indication that he had become excessively fatigued. \"It's like\na nursery tale--never too old to take with the kids. Well, come along,\npoor lamb, the station isn't far.\"\n\nSo great had become the reliance which by this time I habitually reposed\nin these men, that I never sought to oppose their pronouncements (such\na course being not only useless but undignified), and we therefore\ntogether reached the place which the one by my side had described as a\nstation.\n\nFrom the outside the building was in no way imposing, but upon reaching\nan inner dungeon it at once became plain that no matter with what crime\na person might be charged, even the most stubborn resistance would be\nunavailing. Before a fiercely-burning fire were arranged metal pincers,\nmassive skewers, ornamental branding irons, and the usual accessories of\nthe grill, one tool being already thrust into the heart of the flame\nto indicate the nature of its use, and its immediate readiness for the\npurpose. Pegs from which the accused could be hung by the thumbs\nwith weights attached to the feet, covered an entire wall; chains,\nshackling-irons, fetters, steel rings for compressing the throat, and\nbelts for tightening the chest, all had their appointed places, while\nthe Chair, the Boot, the Heavy Hat, and many other appliances quite\nunknown to our system of administering justice were scattered about.\n\nWithout pausing to select any of these, the one who led me approached\na raised desk at which was seated a less warlike official, whose\nsympathetic appearance inspired confidence. \"Kong Ho,\" exclaimed to\nhimself the person who is inscribing these words, \"here is an individual\ninto whose discriminating ear it would be well to pour the exact\nhappening without evasion. Then even if the accusation against you be\nthat of resembling another or trafficking with unlawful Forces, he will\ndoubtless arrange the matter so that the expiation shall be as light and\ninexpensive as possible.\"\n\nBy this time certain other officials had drawn near. \"What is it?\" I\nheard one demand, and another replied, \"Brooklyn Ben and Jimmie the\nButterman again. Ah, they aren't artful, are they!\" but at this moment\nthe two into whose power I had chiefly fallen having conversed together,\nI was commanded to advance towards them and reveal my name.\n\n\"Kong,\" I replied freely; and I had formed a design to explain somewhat\nof the many illustrious ancestors of the House, when the one at the\ndesk, pausing to inscribe my answer in a book, spoke out.\n\n\"Kong?\" he said. \"Is that the christian or surname?\"\n\n\"Sir-name?\" replied this person between two thoughts. \"Undoubtedly\nthe one before you is entitled by public examination to the degree\n'Recognised Talent,' which may, as a meritorious distinction, be held\nequal to your title of a warrior clad in armour. Yet, if it is so held,\nthat would rightly be this person's official name of Paik.\"\n\n\"Oh, it would, would it?\" said the one seated upon the high chair.\n\"That's quite clear. Are there any other names as well?\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" I explained, pained inwardly that one of official rank\nshould so slightly esteem my appearance as to judge that I was so\nmeagrely endowed. \"The milk name of Ho; Tsin upon entering the Classes;\nas a Great Name Cheng; another style in Quank; the official title\nalready expressed, and T'chun, Li, Yuen and Nung as the various\nemergencies of life arise.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the high-chair official courteously. \"Now, just the\nname in full, please, without any velvet trimmings.\"\n\n\"Kong,\" began this person, desirous above all things of putting\nthe matter competently, yet secretly perturbed as to what might be\nconsidered superfluous and what deemed a perfidious suppression, \"Ho\nTsin Cheng Quank--\"\n\n\"Hold hard,\" cried this same one, restraining me with an uplifted pen.\n\"Did you say 'Quack'?\"\n\n\"Quack?\" repeated this person, beginning to become involved within\nhimself, and not grasping the detail in the right position. \"In a manner\nof setting the expression forth--\"\n\n\"Put him down, 'Quack Duck,' sir,\" exclaimed one of dog-like dejection\nwho stood by. \"Most of these Lascars haven't got any real names--they\njust go by what any one happens to call them at the time, like 'Burmese\nIke' down at the Mint,\" and this person unfortunately chancing to smile\nand bow acquiescently at that moment (not with any set intention, but\nas a general principle of courteous urbanity), in place of his really\ndistinguished titles he will henceforth appear among the historical\nrecords of this dynasty under what he cannot disguise from his inner\nmisgivings to be the low-caste appellation of Quack Duck.\n\n\"Now the address, please,\" continued the high one, again preparing to\ninscribe the word, and being determined that by no mischance should this\nparticular be offensively reported, I unhesitatingly replied, \"Beneath\nthe Sign of the Lead Tortoise, on the northern course from the Lotus\nPools outside the walls of Yuen-ping.\"\n\nThis answer the one with the book did not immediately record. \"I\ndon't say it isn't all right when you know the parts,\" he remarked\nbroad-mindedly, \"but it does sound a trifle irregular. Can't you give it\na number and a street?\"\n\n\"I fancy it must be a pub, sir,\" observed another. \"He said that it had\na sign--the Red Tortoise.\"\n\n\"Well, haven't you got a London address?\" said the high one, and this\nperson being able to supply a street and a number as desired, this part\nof the undertaking was disposed of, to his cordial satisfaction.\n\n\"Now let me see the articles which these men left with you,\" commanded\nthe chieftain of the band, and without any misleading discrepancies I at\nonce drew forth from an inner sleeve the two scrips, of which adequate\nmention has already been made, another hitherto undescribed, two\ninstruments for measuring the passing hours of the day, together with a\nchain of fine gold ingeniously wrought into the semblance of a cable,\nan ornament for the breast, set about with a jewel, two neck-cloths of\na kind usually carried in the pocket, a book for recording happenings of\nany moment, pieces of money to the value of about eleven taels, a silver\nflagon, a sheathed weapon and a few lesser objects of insignificant\nvalue. These various details I laid obsequiously before the one who had\ncommanded it, while the others stood around either in explicit silence\nor speaking softly beneath their breath.\n\n\"Do I understand that the two persons left all these things with you,\nwhile they took your purse in exchange?\" said the high official, after\nexamining certain obscure signs upon the metals, the contents of the\nthird scrip, and the like.\n\n\"It cannot reasonably be denied,\" I replied; \"inasmuch as they departed\nwithout them.\"\n\n\"Spontaneously?\" he demanded, and in spite of the unevadible severity of\nhis voice the expression of his nearer eye deviated somewhat.\n\n\"The spoken and conclusive word of the first was that it was his\nintention to commit to this one's keeping everything which he had; the\nassertion of the second being that with this scrip I received all that\nhe possessed.\"\n\n\"While of yours, what did they get, Mr. Quack?\" and the tone of the one\nwho spoke had a much more gratifying modulation than before, while the\nattitudes of those who stood around had favourably changed, until they\nnow conveyed a message of deliberate esteem.\n\n\"A serpent-skin case of two enclosures,\" I replied. \"On the one side\nwas a handcount of the small copper-pieces of this Island, which I had\ncaused to be burnished and gilt for the purpose of taking back to amuse\nthose of Yuen-ping. On the other side were two or three pages from a\ngravity-removing printed leaf entitled 'Bits of Tits,' with which\nthis person weekly instructs himself in the simpler rudiments of the\nlanguage. For the rest the case was controlled by a hidden spring, and\ninscribed about with a charm against loss, consumption by fire, or being\nsecretly acquired by the unworthy.\"\n\n\"I don't think you stand in much need of that charm, Mr. Quack,\"\nremarked another of more than ordinary rank, who was also present. \"Then\nthey really got practically no money from you?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" I admitted. \"It was never literally stipulated, and\nwhatever of wealth he possesses this person carries in a concealed spot\nbeneath his waistbelt.\" (For even to these, virtuous sire, I did not\ndeem it expedient to reveal the fact that in reality it is hidden within\nthe sole of my left sandal.)\n\n\"I congratulate you,\" he said with lavish refinement. \"Ben and the\nButterman can be very bland and persuasive. Could you tell me, as a\nmatter of professional curiosity, what first put you on your guard?\"\n\n\"In this person's country,\" I replied, \"there is an apt saying, 'The\nsagacious bird does not build his nest twice in the empty soup-toureen,'\nand by observing closely what has gone before one may accurately\nconjecture much that will follow after.\" It may be, that out of my\ninsufferable shortcomings of style and expression, this answer did not\nconvey to his mind the logical sequence of the warning; yet it would\nhave been more difficult to show him how everything arose from the\nfaultlessly-balanced system of the heroic Wei Chung, or the exact\nparallel lying between the ill-clad outcast who demanded a portion of\ntobacco and the cheerfully unassuming stranger who had in his possession\na larger accumulation of money than he could conveniently disperse.\n\nIn such a manner I took leave of the station and those connected with\nit, after directing that the share of the spoil which fell by the law\nof this Island to my lot should be sold and the money of exchange\nfaithfully divided among the virtuous and necessitous of both sexes. The\nhigher officials each waved me pleasantly by the hand, according to the\nstriking and picturesque custom of the land, while the lesser ones stood\naround and spoke flattering words as I departed, as \"honourable,\" \"a\nsmall piece of all-right,\" \"astute ancient male fowl,\" \"ah!\" and the\nlike.\n\nWith repeated assurances that however ineptly the adventure may at the\ntime appear to be tending, as regards the essentials of true dignity\nand an undeviating grasp upon articles of negotiable value, nothing of a\nregrettable incident need be feared.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER IX\n\n\n Concerning the proverb of the highly-accomplished horse. The\n various perils to be encountered in the Beneath Parts. The\n inexplicable journey performed by this one, and concerning\n the obscurity of the witchcraft employed.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--Among these islanders there is a proverb, \"Do not place\nthe carte\" (or card, the two words having an identical purport, and\nboth signifying the inscribed tablet of viands prepared for a banquet,)\n\"before the horse.\" Doubtless the saying first arose as a timely rebuke\nto a certain barbarian emperor who announced his contempt for the\nintelligence of his subjects by conferring high mandarin rank upon a\nfavourite steed and ceremoniously appointing it to be his chancellor;\nbut from the narrower moral that an unreasoning animal is out of place,\nand even unseemly, in the entertaining hall or council chamber, the\nexpression has in the course of time taken a wider application and is\nnow freely used as an insidious thrust at one who may be suspected of\ncontrariness of character, of confusing issues, or of acting in a vain\nor illogical manner. I had already preserved the saying among other\ninstances of foreign thought and expression which I am collecting for\nyour dignified amusement, as it is very characteristic of the wisdom and\nhumour of these Outer Lands. The imagination is essentially barbaric. A\nhorse--doubtless well-groomed, richly-caparisoned, and as intellectual\nas the circumstances will permit, but inevitably an animal of degraded\nattributes and untraceable ancestry--a horse reclining before a lavishly\nset-out table and considering well of what dish it shall next partake!\nCould anything, it appears, be more diverting! Truly to our more refined\noutlook the analogy is lacking both in delicacy of wit and in exactitude\nof balance, but to the grosser barbarian conception of what is\ngravity-removing it is irresistible.\n\nI am, however, reminded of the saying by perceiving that I was on the\npoint of recording certain details of recent occurrence without first\nunrolling to your mind the incidents from which it has arisen that the\nperson who is now communicating with you is no longer reposing in the\nCapital, but spending a period profitably in observing the habits of\nthose who dwell in the more secluded recesses on the outskirts of the\nIsland. This reversal of the proper sequence of affairs would doubtless\nstrike those around as an instance of setting the banquet before the\nhorse. Without delay, then, to pursue the allusion to its appropriate\nend, I will return, as it may be said, to my nosebag.\n\nAt various points about the streets of the Capital there are certain\ncaverns artificially let into the bowels of the earth, to which any\nperson may betake himself upon purchasing a printed sign which he must\ndisplay to the guardian of the gate. Once within the underneathmost\nparts he is free to be carried from place to place by means of the\ntrains of carriages which I have already described to you, until he\nwould return to the outer surface, when he must again display his\ntalisman before he is permitted to pass forth. Nor is this an empty\nform, for upon an occasion this person himself witnessed a very bitter\ncontention between a keeper of the barrier and one whose token had\nthrough some cause lost its potency.\n\nIn the company of the experienced I had previously gone through the\ntrial without mischance, so that recently when I expressed a wish to\nvisit a certain Palace, and was informed that the most convenient manner\nwould be to descend into the nearest cavern, I had no reasonable device\nfor avoiding the encounter. Nevertheless, enlightened sire, I will\nnot attempt to conceal from your omniscience that I was by no means\nimpetuous towards the adventure. Owing to the pugnacious and unworthy\nsuspicions of those who direct their destinies, I have not yet been\nable to penetrate the exact connection between the movements of these\nhot-smoke chariots and the Unseen Forces. To a person whose chief object\nin life is to avoid giving offence to any of the innumerable demons\nwhich are ever on the watch to revenge themselves upon our slightest\nindiscretion, this uncertainty opens an unending vista of intolerable\npossibilities. As if to emphasise the perils of this overhanging doubt\nthe surroundings are ingeniously arranged so as to represent as nearly\nas practicable the terrors of the Beneath World. Both by day and night a\nfunereal gloom envelops the caverns, the pathways and resting-places are\nmeagre and so constructed as to be devoid of attraction or repose, and\nby a skilful contrivance the natural atmosphere is secretly withdrawn\nand a very acrimonious sulphurous haze driven in to replace it.\nIn sudden and unforeseen places eyes of fire open and close with\ndisconcerting rapidity, and even change colour in vindictive\nsignificance; wooden hands are outstretched as in unrelenting rigidity\nagainst supplication, or, divining the unexpressed thoughts, inexorably\npoint, as one gazes, still deeper into the recesses of the earth; while\nthe air is never free from the sounds of groans, shrieks, the rattling\nof chains, dull, hopeless noises beneath one's feet or overhead, and the\nhoarse wordless cries of despair with which the attending slaves of the\ncaverns greet the distant clamour of every approaching fire-chariot.\nAdmittedly the intention of the device is benevolently conceived, and\nit is strenuously asserted that many persons of corrupt habits and\nill-balanced lives, upon waking unexpectedly while passing through\nthese Beneath Parts, have abandoned the remainder of their journey, and,\nescaping hastily to the outer air, have from that time onwards led a\npure and consistent existence; but, on the other foot, those who are\ncompelled to use the caverns daily, freely confess that the surroundings\nto not in any material degree purify their lives of tranquillise the\nnature of their inner thoughts.\n\nIn this emergency I did not neglect to write out a diversity of charms\nagainst every possible variety of evil influence, and concealing them\nlavishly about my head and body, I presented myself with the outer\nconfidence of a person who is inured to the exploit. Doubtless thereby\nbeing mistaken for one of themselves in the obscurity, I received the\ninscribed safeguard without opposition, and even an added sum in copper\npieces, which I discreetly returned to the one behind the shutter, with\nthe request that he would honourably burn a few joss sticks or sacrifice\nto a trivial amount, to the success of my journey. In such a manner\nI reached an awaiting train, and, taking up within it a position of\nretiring modesty, I definitely committed myself to the undertaking.\n\nAt the next tarrying place there entered a barbarian of high-class\nappearance, and being by this time less assured of my competence in the\nmatter unaided, both on account of the multiplicity of evil omens on\nevery side, and the perverse impulses of the guiding demon, whereby\nat sudden angles certain of my organs had the emotion of being left\nirrevocably behind and others of being snatched relentlessly forward, I\napproached him courteously.\n\n\"Behold,\" I said, \"many thousand li of water, both fresh and bitter,\nflow between the one who is addressing you and his native town of\nYuen-ping, where the tablets at the street corners are as familiar to\nhim as the lines of his own unshapely hands; for, as it is truly said,\n'Does the starling know the lotus roots, or the pomfret read its way by\nthe signs among the upper branches of the pines?' Out of the necessities\nof his ignorance and your own overwhelming condescension enlighten him,\ntherefore, whether the destination of this fire-chariot by any chance\ncorresponds with the inscribed name upon his talisman?\"\n\nThus adjured, the stranger benevolently turned himself to the detail,\nand upon consulting a book of symbols he expressed himself to this wise:\nthat after a sufficient interval I should come into a certain station,\ncalled in part after the title of the enlightened ruler of this Island,\nand there abandoning the train which was carrying us, I should enter\nanother which would bring me out of the Beneath Parts and presently into\nthe midst of that Palace which I sought. This advice seemed good, for\na reasonable connection might be supposed to exist between a station\nso auspiciously called and a Palace bearing the harmonious name of\nthe gracious and universally-revered sovereign-consort. Accordingly I\nthanked him ceremoniously, not only on my own part, but also on behalf\nof eleven generations of immediate ancestors, and in the name of seven\ngenerations who should come after, and he on his side agreeably replied\nthat he was sure his grandmother would have done as much for mine, and\nhe sincerely hoped that none of his great-great-grandchildren would\nprove less obliging. In this intellectual manner, varied with the\nentertainment of profuse bows, the time passed cordially between us\nuntil the barbarian reached his own alighting stage, when he again\nrepeated the various details of the strategy for my observance.\n\nAt this point let it be set forth deliberately that there existed no\ntreachery in the advice, still less that this person is incapable of\ncompetently achieving the destined end of any hazard upon which he\nmay embark when once the guiding signs have been made clear to his\nunderstanding. Whatever entanglement arose was due merely to the\nconflicting manners of expression used by two widely-varying races, even\nas our own proverb says, \"What is only sauce for the cod is serious for\nthe oyster.\"\n\nAt the station indicated as bearing the sign of the ruler of the country\n(which even a person of little discernment could have recognised by\nthe highly-illuminated representation bearing the elusively-worded\ninscription, \"In packets only\"), I left this fire-chariot, and at once\nperceiving another in an attitude of departure, I entered it, as the\ncasual barbarian had definitely instructed, and began to assure myself\nthat I had already become expertly proficient in the art of journeying\namong these Beneath Regions and to foresee the time, not far distant,\nwhen others would confidently address themselves to me in their\nextremities. So entrancing did this contemplation grow, that this\noutrageous person began to compose the actual words with which he would\ninstruct them as the occasion arose, as thus, \"Undoubtedly, O virtuous\nand not unattractive maiden, this fire-engine will ultimately lead your\nrefined footsteps into the street called Those who Bake Food. Do not\nhesitate, therefore, to occupy the vacant place by this insignificant\none's side\"; or, \"By no means, honourable sir; the Cross of Charing\nis in the precisely opposite direction to that selected by this\nself-opinionated machine for its inopportune destination. Do not rebuke\nthis person for his immoderate loss of mental gravity, for your mistake,\nthough pardonable in a stranger, is really excessively diverting. Your\nmost prudent course now will assuredly be to cast yourself from the\ncarriage without delay and rely upon the benevolent intervention of a\nfire-chariot proceeding backwards.\"\n\nAlas, it is truly said, \"None but sword-swallowers should endeavour to\nswallow swords,\" thereby signifying the vast chasm that lies between\nthose who are really adroit in an undertaking and those who only think\nthat they may easily become so. Presently it began to become deeply\nimpressed upon my discrimination that the journey was taking a more\nlengthy duration than I had been given to understand would be the case,\nwhile at the same time a permanent deliverance from the terrors of the\nBeneath Parts seemed to be insidiously lengthening out into a funereal\nunattainableness. The point of this person's destination, he had been\nassured on all hands, was a spot beyond which even the most aggressively\nassertive engine could not proceed, so that he had no fears of being\nincapably drawn into more remote places, yet when hour after hour passed\nand the ill-destined machine never failed in its malicious endeavours to\nleave each successive tarrying station, it is not to be denied that\nmy imagination dwelt regretfully upon the true civilisation of our\nown enlightened country, where, by the considerate intervention of an\nall-wise government, the possibilities of so distressing an experience\nare sympathetically removed from one's path. Thus the greater part of\nthe day had faded, and I was conjecturing that by this time we must\ninevitably be approaching the barren and inhospitable country which\nforms the northern limit of the Island, when the door suddenly opened\nand the barbarian stranger whom I had left many hundred li behind\nentered the carriage.\n\nAt this manifestation all uncertainty departed, and I now understood\nthat to some obscure end witchcraft of a very powerful and high-caste\nkind was being employed around me; for in no other way was it credible\nto one's intelligence that a person could propel himself through the\nair with a speed greater than that of one of these fire-chariots, and\novertake it. Doubtless it was a part of this same scheme which made it\nseem expedient to the stranger that he should feign a part, for he\nat once greeted me as though the occasion were a matter of everyday\nhappening, exclaiming genially--\n\n\"Well, Mr. Kong, returning? And what do you think of the Palace?\"\n\n\"It is fitly observed, 'To the earthworm the rice stalk is as high as\nthe pagoda,'\" I replied with adroit evasion, clearly understanding from\nhis manner that for some reason, not yet revealed to me, a course of\ndissimulation was expedient in order to mislead the surrounding\ndemons concerning my movements, and by a subtle indication of the face\nconveying to the stranger an assurance that I had tactfully grasped\nthe requirement, and would endeavour to walk well upon his heels,\n\"and therefore it would be unseemly for a person of my insignificant\nattainments to engage in the doubtful flattery of comparing it with\nthe many other residences of the pure and exalted which embellish your\nCapital.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the one whom I may now suitably describe by the name of Sir\nPhilip, \"that's rather a useful proverb sometimes. Many people there?\"\n\nAt this inquiry I could not disguise from myself an emotion that\nthe person seated opposite was not diplomatically inspired in so\npersistently clinging to the one subject upon which he must assuredly\nknow that I experienced an all-pervading deficiency. Nevertheless,\nbeing by this more fully convinced that the disguise was one of critical\nnecessity, and not deeming that the essential ceremonies of one Palace\nwould differ from those of another, no matter in what land they stood\n(while through all I read a clear design on Sir Philip's part that\nthe opportunity was craftily arranged so that I might impress upon any\nvindictively-intentioned spirits within hearing an assumption of high\nprotection), I replied that the gathering had been one of unparalleled\nsplendour, both by reason of the multitude of exalted nobles present\nand also owing to the jewelled magnificence lavished on every detail.\nFurthermore, I continued, now definitely abandoning all the promptings\nof a wise reserve, and reflecting, as we say, that one may as well be\ndrowned in the ocean as in a wooden bucket, not only did the sublime and\nunapproachable sovereign graciously permit me to kow-tow respectfully\nbefore him, but subsequently calling me to his side beneath a canopy of\ngolden radiance, he conversed genially with me and benevolently assured\nme of his sympathetic favour on all occasions (this, I conjectured,\nwould certainly overawe any Evil Force not among the very highest\ncircles), while the no less magnanimous Prince of the Imperial Line\nquestioned me with flattering assiduousness concerning a method of\ncommunicating with persons at a distance by means of blows or stamps\nupon a post (as far as the outer meaning conveyed itself to me), the\nhouses which we build, and whether they contained an adequate provision\nof enclosed spaces in the walls.\n\nDoubtless I could have continued in this praiseworthy spirit of delicate\ncordiality to an indefinite amount had I not chanced to observe at this\npoint that the expression of Sir Philip's urbanity had become entangled\nin a variety of other emotions, not all propitious to the scheme,\nso that in order to retire imperceptibly within myself I smiled\nbroad-mindedly, remarking that it was well said that the moon was only\nbright while the sun was hid, and that I had lately been dazzled with\nthe sight of so much brilliance and virtuous condescension that\nthere were occasions when I questioned inwardly how much I had really\nwitnessed, and how much had been conveyed to me in the nature of an\nintrospective vision.\n\nIt will already have been made plain to you, O my courtly-mannered\nfather, that these barbarians are totally deficient in the polite\nart whereby two persons may carry on a flattering and highly-attuned\nconversation, mutually advantageous to the esteem of each, without it\nbeing necessary in any way that their statements should have more than\nan ornamental actuality. So wanting in this, the most concentrated form\nof truly well-bred entertainment, are even their high officials,\nthat after a few more remarks, to which I made answer in a spirit of\nskilfully-sustained elusiveness, the utterly obtuse Sir Philip said at\nlength, \"Excuse my asking, Mr. Kong, but have you really been to the\nAlexandra Palace at all?\"\n\nAdmittedly there are few occasions in life on which it is not possible\nto fail to see the inopportune or low-class by a dignified impassiveness\nof features, an adroitly-directed jest, or a remark of baffling\ninconsequence, but in the face of so distressingly straightforward a\ndemand what can be advanced by a person of susceptible refinement when\nopposed to one of incomparably larger dimensions, imprisoned by his side\nin the recess of a fire-chariot which is leaping forward with uncurbed\nvelocity, and surrounded by demons with whose habits and partialities he\nis unfamiliar?\n\n\"In a manner of expressing the circumstance,\" I replied, \"it is not to\nbe denied that this person's actual footsteps may have imperceptibly\nbeen drawn somewhat aside from the path of his former design. Yet\ninasmuch as it is truly said that the body is in all things subservient\nto the mind, and is led withersoever it is willed, and as your engaging\ndirections were scrupulously observed with undeviating fidelity, it\nwould be impertinently self-opinionated on this person's part to\nimply that they failed to guide him to his destination. Thus, for all\nceremonial purposes, it is permissible conscientiously to assume that he\nHAS been there.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I must not have been sufficiently clear,\" said Sir\nPhilip. \"Did you miss the train at King's Cross?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" I replied firmly, pained inwardly that he should cast the\nshadow of such narrow incompetence upon me. \"Seeing this machine on the\npoint of setting forth on a journey, even as your overwhelming\nsagacity had enabled you to predict would be the case, I embarked with\nself-reliant confidence.\"\n\n\"Good lord!\" murmured the person opposite, beginning to manifest an\nexcess of emotion for which I was quite unable to account. \"Then you\nhave been in this train--your actual footsteps I mean, Mr. Kong; not\nyour ceremonial abstract subliminal ego--ever since?\"\n\nTo this I replied that his words shone like the moon at midnight with\nscintillating points of truth; adding, however, as the courtesies of\nthe occasion required, that I had been so impressed with the many-sided\nbrilliance of his conversation earlier in the day as to render the\nflight of time practically unnoticed by me.\n\n\"But did it never occur to you to ask at one of the stations?\" he\ndemanded, still continuing to wave his hands incapably from side to\nside. \"Any of the porters would have told you.\"\n\n\"Kong Li Heng, the founder of our line, who was really great, has been\ndead eleven centuries, and no single fact or incident connected with his\nlife has been preserved to influence mankind,\" I replied. \"How much less\nwill it matter, then, even in so limited a space of time as a hundred\nyears, in what fashion so insignificant a person as the one before you\nacted on any occasion, and why, therefore, should he distress himself\nunnecessarily to any precise end?\" In this manner I sought to place\nbefore him the dignified example of an imperturbability which can be\nmaintained in every emergency, and at the same time to administer a\nplain yet scrupulously-sheathed rebuke; for the inauspicious manner in\nwhich he had first drawn me on to speak confidently of the ceremonies of\nthe Royal Palace and then held up my inadequacy to undeserved contempt\nhad not rejoiced my imagination, and I was still uncertain how much to\nclaim, and whether, perchance, even yet a more subtle craft lay under\nall.\n\n\"Well, in any case, when you go back you can claim the distinction of\nhaving been taken seven times round London, although you can't really\nhave seen much of it,\" said Sir Philip. \"This is a Circle train.\"\n\nAt this assertion I looked up. Though admittedly curved a little about\nthe roof the chariot was in every essential degree what we should\npronounce to be a square one; whereupon, feeling at length that the\ninvolvement had definitely passed to a point beyond my contemptible\ndiscernment, I spread out my hands acquiescently and affably remarked\nthat the days were lengthening out pleasantly.\n\nIn such a manner I became acquainted with the one Sir Philip, and\nthereby, in a somewhat circuitous line, the original purpose which\npossessed my brush when I began this inept and commonplace letter\nis reached; for the person in question not only lay upon himself the\nobligation of leading me \"by the strings of his apron-garment\"--in the\ncharacteristic and fanciful turn of the barbarian language--to that same\nPalace on the following day, but thenceforth gracefully affecting to\ndiscern certain agreeable virtues in my conversation and custom of habit\nhe frequently sought me out. More recently, on the double plea that they\nof his household had a desire to meet me, and that if I spent all my\ntime within the Capital my impressions of the Island would necessarily\nbe ill-balanced and deformed, he advanced a project that I should\naccompany him to a spot where, as far as I was competent to grasp\nthe idiom, he was in the habit of sitting (doubtless in an abstruse\nreverie), in the country; and having assured myself by means of discreet\ninnuendo that the seat referred to would be adequate for this person\nalso, and that the occasion did not in any way involve a payment of\nmoney, I at once expressed my willingness towards the adventure.\n\nWith numerous expressions of unfeigned regret (from a filial point of\nview) that the voice of one of the maidens of the household, lifted\nin the nature of a defiance against this one to engage with her in a\ntwo-handed conflict of hong pong, obliges him to bring this immature\ncomposition to a hasty close.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER X\n\n\n Concerning the authority of this high official, Sir Philip.\n The side-slipperyness of barbarian etiquette. The hurl-\n headlong sportiveness and that achieving its end by means of\n curved mallets.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--If this person's memory is accurately poised on the\ndetail, he was compelled to abandon his former letter (when on the point\nof describing the customs of these outer places), in order to take part\nin a philosophical discussion with some of the venerable sages of the\nneighbourhood.\n\nResuming the narration where it had reached this remote province of\nthe Empire, it is a suitable opportunity to explain that this same\nSir Philip is here greeted on every side with marks of deferential\nsubmission, and is undoubtedly an official of high button, for whenever\nthe inclination seizes him he causes prisoners to be sought out, and\nthen proceeds to administer justice impartially upon them. In the case\nof the wealthy and those who have face to lose, the matter is generally\narranged, to his profit and to the satisfaction of all, by the payment\nof an adequate sum of money, after the invariable custom of our own\nmandarincy. When this incentive to leniency is absent it is usual to\ncondemn the captive to imprisonment in a cell (it is denied officially,\nbut there is no reason to doubt that a large earthenware vessel is\noccasionally used for this purpose,) for varying periods, though it is\nnotorious that in the case of the very necessitous they are sometimes\nset freely at liberty, and those who took them publicly reprimanded for\naccusing persons from whose condition on possible profit could arise.\nThis confinement is seldom inflicted for a longer period than seven,\nfourteen, or twenty-one days (these being lucky numbers,) except in the\ncase of those who have been held guilty of ensnaring certain birds and\nbeasts which appear to be regarded as sacred, for they have their duly\nappointed attendants who wear a garb and are trained in the dexterous\nuse of arms, lurking with loaded weapons in secret places to catch the\nunwary, both by night and day. Upheld by the high nature of their office\nthese persons shrink from no encounter and even suffer themselves to be\nkilled with resolute unconcern; but when successful they are not denied\nan efficient triumph, for it is admitted that those whom they capture\nare marked men from that time (doubtless being branded upon the body\nwith the name of their captor), and no future defence is availing. The\nthird punishment, that of torture, is reserved for a class of solitary\nmendicants who travel from place to place, doubtless spreading the germs\nof an inflammatory doctrine of rebellion, for, owing to my own degraded\nobtuseness, the actual nature of their crimes could never be made clear\nto me. Of the tortures employed that known in their language as the\n\"bath\" (for which we have no real equivalent,) is the most dreaded, and\nthis person has himself beheld men of gigantic proportions, whose bodies\nbore the stain of a voluntary endurance to every privation, abandon\nthemselves to a most ignoble despair upon hearing the ill-destined word.\nUnquestionably the infliction is closely connected with our own ordeal\nof boiling water, but from other indications it is only reasonable to\nadmit that there is an added ingredient, of which we probably have no\nknowledge, whereby the effect is enhanced in every degree, and the outer\nsurface of the victim rendered more vulnerable. There is also another\nand milder form of torture, known as the \"task\", consisting either of\nsharp-edged stones being broken upon the body, or else the body broken\nupon sharp-edged stones, but precisely which is the official etiquette\nof the case this person's insatiable passion for accuracy and his\nshort-sighted limitations among the more technical outlines of the\nlanguage, prevent him from stating definitely.\n\nLet it here be openly confessed that the intricately-arranged titles\nused among these islanders, and the widely-varying dignities which they\nconvey, have never ceased to embarrass my greetings on all occasions,\nand even yet, when a more crystal insight into their strangely illogical\nmanners enables me not only to understand them clearly myself, but\nalso to expound their significance to others, a necessary reticence is\nblended with my most profuse cordiality, and my salutations to one whom\nI am for the first time encountering are now so irreproachably balanced,\nthat I can imperceptibly develop them into an engaging effusion, or,\nwithout actual offence, draw back into a condition of unapproachable\nexclusiveness as the necessity may arise. With us, O my immaculate sire,\na yellow silk umbrella has for three thousand years denoted a fixed and\nrecognisable title. A mandarin of the sixth degree need not hesitate to\nmingle on terms of assured equality with other mandarins of the sixth\ndegree, and without any guide beyond a seemly instinct he perceives\nthe reasonableness of assuming a deferential obsequiousness before a\nmandarin of the fifth rank, and a counterbalancing arrogance when in the\nsociety of an official who has only risen to the seventh degree, thus\nconforming to that essential principle of harmonious intercourse,\n\"Remember that Chang Chow's ceiling is Tong Wi's floor\"; but who shall\nwalk with even footsteps in a land where the most degraded may legally\nbear the same distinguished name as that of the enlightened sovereign\nhimself, where the admittedly difficult but even more purposeless\nachievement of causing a gold mine to float is held to be more\npraiseworthy than to pass a competitive examination or to compose a\npoem of inimitable brilliance, and where one wearing gilt buttons and an\nemblem in his hat proves upon ingratiating approach not to be a powerful\nofficial but a covetous and illiterate slave of inferior rank?\nThus, through their own narrow-minded inconsistencies, even the most\nceremoniously-proficient may at times present an ill-balanced attitude.\nThis, without reproach to himself, concerns the inward cause whereby\nthe one who is placed to you in the relation of an affectionate and\never-resourceful son found unexpectedly that he had lost the benignant\nfull face of a lady of exalted title.\n\nAt that time I had formed the acquaintance, in an obscure quarter of the\ncity, of one who wore a uniform, and was addressed on all sides as the\ncommander of a band, while the gold letters upon the neck part of his\nouter garment inevitably suggested that he had borne an honourable share\nin the recent campaign in a distant land. As I had frequently met many\nof similar rank drinking tea at the house of the engaging countess to\nwhom I have alluded, I did not hesitate to prevail upon this Captain\nMiggs to accompany me there upon an occasion also, assuring him of\nequality and a sympathetic reception; but from the moment of our\narrival the attitudes of those around pointed to the existence of some\nunpropitious barrier invisible to me, and when the one with whom I was\nassociated took up an unassailable position upon the central table,\nand began to speak authoritatively upon the subject of The Virtues,\nthe unenviable condition of the proud and affluent, and the myriads of\nfire-demons certainly laying in wait for those who partook of spiced tea\nand rich foods in the afternoon, and did not wear a uniform similar to\nhis own, I began to recognise that the selection had been inauspiciously\narranged. Upon taxing some around with the discrepancy (as there seemed\nto be no more dignified way of evading the responsibility), they were\nunable to contend against me that there were, indeed, two, if not more,\ndistinct varieties of those bearing the rank of captain, and that they\nthemselves belonged to an entirely different camp, wearing another\ndress, and possessing no authority to display the symbol of the letters\nS.A. upon their necks. With this admission I was content to leave the\nmatter, in no way accusing them of actual duplicity, yet so withdrawing\nthat any of unprejudiced standing could not fail to carry away the\nimpression that I had been the victim of an unworthy artifice, and had\nbeen lured into their society by the pretext that they were other than\nwhat they really were.\n\nWith the bitter-flavoured memory of this, and other in no way dissimilar\nepisodes, lingering in my throat, it need not be a matter of conjecture\nthat for a time I greeted warily all who bore a title, a mark of rank,\nor any similar appendage; who wore a uniform, weapon, brass helmet,\njewelled crown, coat of distinctive colour, or any excessive superfluity\nof pearl or metal buttons; who went forth surrounded by a retinue, sat\npublicly in a chair or allegorical chariot, spoke loudly in the highways\nand places in a tone of official pronouncement, displayed any feather,\nemblem, inscribed badge, or printed announcement upon a pole, or in any\nway conducted themselves in what we should esteem to be fitting to\na position of high dignity. From this arose the absence of outward\nenthusiasm with which I at first received Sir Philip's extended\nfavour; for although I had come to distrust all the reasonable signs of\nestablished power, I distrusted, to a much more enhanced degree, their\ncomplete absence; and when I observed that the one in question was never\naccompanied by a band of musicians or flower-strewers, that he mingled\nas though on terms of familiar intercourse with the ordinary passers-by\nin the streets, and never struck aside those who chanced to impede\nhis progress, and that he actually preferred those of low condition to\napproach him on their feet, rather than in the more becoming attitude\nof unconditional prostration, I reasoned with myself whether indeed he\ncould consistently be a person of well-established authority, or whether\nI was not being again led away from my self-satisfaction by another\nobliquity of barbarian logic. It was for this reason that I now welcomed\nthe admitted power which he has of incriminating persons in a variety\nof punishable offences, and I perceived with an added satisfaction\nthat here, where this privilege is more fully understood, few meet him\nwithout raising their hands to the upper part of their heads in token of\nunquestioning submission; or, as one would interpret the symbolism into\nactual words, meaning, \"Thus, from this point to the underneath part of\nour sandals, all between lies in the hollow of your comprehensive hand.\"\n\nThere is a written jest among another barbarian nation that these among\nwhom I am tarrying, being by nature a people who take their pleasures\ntragically, when they rise in the morning say, one to another, \"Come,\nbehold; it is raining again as usual; let us go out and kill somebody.\"\nUndoubtedly the pointed end of this adroit-witted saying may be found\nin the circumstance that it is, indeed, as the proverb aptly claims,\nraining on practically every occasion in life; while, to complete the\ncomparison, for many dynasties past this nation has been successfully\nengaged in killing people (in order to promote their ultimate benefit\nthrough a momentary inconvenience,) in every part of the world. Thus\nthe lines of parallel thought maintain a harmonious balance beyond the\ngeneral analogy of their sayings; but beneath this may be found an even\nsubtler edge, for in order to inure themselves to the requirement of a\nhigh destiny their various games and manners of disportment are, with a\nset purpose, so rigorously contested that in their progress most of the\nweak and inefficient are opportunely exterminated.\n\nThere is a favourite and well-attended display wherein two opposing\nbands, each clad in robes of a distinctive colour, stand in extended\nlines of mutual defiance, and at a signal impetuously engage. The\ndesign of each is by force or guile to draw their opponents into an\nunfavourable position before an arch of upright posts, and then surging\nirresistibly forward, to carry them beyond the limit and hurl them to\nthe ground. Those who successfully inflict this humiliation upon their\nadversaries until they are incapable of further resistance are hailed\nvictorious, and sinking into a graceful attitude receive each a golden\ncup from the magnanimous hands of a maiden chose to the service, either\non account of her peerless outline, the dignified position of her House,\nor (should these incentives be obviously wanting,) because the chief\nones of her family are in the habit of contributing unstintingly to the\nequipment of the triumphal band. There is also another kind of strife,\ndiffering in its essentials only so far that all who engage therein are\nprovided with a curved staff, with which they may dexterously draw their\nantagonists beyond the limits, or, should they fail to defend themselves\nadequately, break the smaller bones of their ankles. But this form of\nencounter, despite the use of these weapons, is really less fatal\nthan the other, for it is not a permissible act to club an antagonist\nresentfully about the head with the staff, nor yet even to thrust\nit rigidly against his middle body. From this moderation the public\ncountenance extended to the curved-pole game is contemptibly meagre when\nviewed by the side of the overwhelming multitudes which pour along every\nchannel in order to witness a more than usually desperate trial of the\nhurl-headlong variety (the sight, indeed, being as attractive to these\npale, blood-thirsty foreigners as an unusually large execution is\nwith us), and as a consequence the former is little reputed save among\nmaidens, the feeble, and those of timorous instincts.\n\nThus positioned, regarding a knowledge of their outside amusements, it\nhas always been one of the most prominent ambitions of this person's\nstrategy to avoid being drawn into any encounter. At the same time,\nthe thought that the maidens of the household here (of whom there are\nseveral, all so attractively proportioned that to compare them in a\nspirit of definite preference would be distastefully presumptuous to\nthis person,) should regard me as one lacking in a sufficient display\nof violence was not fragrant to my sense of refinement; so that when\nSir Philip, a little time after our arrival, related to me that on the\nfollowing day he and a chosen band were to be engaged in the match of a\ncricket game against adversaries from the village, and asked whether I\ncared to bear a part in the strife, I grasped the muscles of the upper\npart of my left arm with my right hand--as I had frequently seen the\nhardy and virile do when the subject of their powers had been raised\nquestioningly--and replied that I had long concealed an insatiable wish\nto take such a part at a point where the conflict would be the most\nrevengefully contested.\n\nBeing thus inflexibly committed it became very necessary to arrange a\nwell-timed intervention (whether in the nature of bodily disorder, fire,\nor demoniacal upheaval, a warning omen, or the death of some of our\nchief antagonists), but before doing so I was desirous of understanding\nhow this contest, which had hitherto remained outside my experience, was\nwaged.\n\nThere is here one of benevolent rotundity in whose authority lie the\ncavernous stores beneath the house and the vessels of gold and silver;\nof menial rank admittedly, yet exacting a seemly deference from all\nby the rich urbanity of his voice and the dignity of his massive\nproportions. In the affable condescension of his tone, and the\ndiscriminating encouragement of his attitude towards me on all\noccasions, I have read a sympathetic concern over my welfare. Him I now\napproached, and taking him aside, I first questioned him flatteringly\nabout his age and the extent of his yearly recompense, and then casually\ninquired what in his language he would describe the nature of a cricket\nto be.\n\n\"A cricket?\" repeated the obliging person readily; \"a cricket, sir, is a\nhinsect. Something, I take it, after the manner of a grass-'opper.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" I agreed. \"It is aptly likened. And, to continue the simile, a\ngame cricket--?\"\n\n\"A game cricket?\" he replied; \"well, sir, naturally a game one would be\nmore gamier than the others, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"The inference is unflinching,\" I admitted, and after successfully\nluring away his mind from any significance in the inquiry by asking him\nwhether the gift of a lacquered coffin or an embroidered shroud would be\nthe more regarded on parting, I left him.\n\nHis words, esteemed, for a definite reason were as the jade-clappered\nmelody of a silver bell. This trial of sportiveness, it became\nclear,--less of a massacre than most of their amusements--is really\na rivalry of leapings and dexterity of the feet: a conflict of game\ncrickets or grass-hoppers, in the somewhat wide-angled obscurity of\ntheir language, or, as we would more appropriately call it doubtless,\na festive competition in the similitude of high-spirited locusts. To\nwhatever degree the surrounding conditions might vary, there could no\nlonger be a doubt that the power of leaping high into the air was\nthe essential constituent of success in this barbarian match of\ncrickets--and in such an accomplishment this person excelled from the\ntime of his youth with a truly incredible proficiency. Can it be a\nreproach, then, that when I considered this, and saw in a vision the\ncontempt of inferiority which I should certainly be able to inflict\nupon these native crickets before the eyes of their maidens, even\nthe accumulated impassiveness of thirty-seven generations of Kong\nfore-fathers broke down for the moment, and unable to restrain every\nvestige of emotion I crept unperceived to the ancestral hall of Sir\nPhilip and there shook hands affectionately with myself before each of\nthe nine ironclad warriors about its walls before I could revert to\na becoming state of trustworthy unconcern. That night in my own upper\nchamber I spent many hours in testing my powers and studying more\nremarkable attitudes of locust flight, and I even found to be within\nmyself some new attainments of life-like agility, such as feigning the\ncontinuous note of defiance with which the insect meets his adversary,\nas remaining poised in the air for an appreciable moment at the summit\nof each leap, and of conveying to the body a sudden and disconcerting\nsideway movement in the course of its ascent. So immersed did I become\nin the achievement of a high perfection that, to my never-ending\nself-reproach, I failed to notice a supernatural visitation of undoubted\nauthenticity; for the next morning it was widely admitted that a certain\nfamiliar demon of the house, which only manifests its presence on\noccasions of tragic omen, had been heard throughout the night in\nwarning, not only beating its head and body against the walls and\ndoors in despair, but raising from time to time a wailing cry of\nsoul-benumbing bitterness.\n\nWith every assurance that the next letter, though equally distorted\nin style and immature in expression, will contain the record of a\ndeteriorated but ever upward-striving son's ultimate triumph.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XI\n\n\n Concerning the game which we should call \"Locusts,\" and the\n deeper significance of its acts. The solicitous warning of\n one passing inwards and the complication occasioned by his\n ill-chosen words. Concerning that victory already dimly\n foreshadowed.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--This barbarian game of agile grass-hoppers is not\nconducted in the best spirit of a really well-balanced display, and\nalthough the one now inscribing his emotions certainly achieved a wide\npopularity, and wore his fig leaves with becoming modesty, he has never\nsince been quite free from an overhanging doubt that the compliments and\ngenial remarks with which he was assailed owed their modulation to an\nunsubstantial atmosphere of two-edged significance which for a period\nenveloped all whom he approached; as in the faces of maidens concealed\nbehind fans when he passed, the down-drawn lips and up-raised eyes\nof those of fuller maturity, the practice in most of his own kind\nof turning aside, pressing their hands about their middle parts, and\nbending forward into a swollen attitude devoid of grace, on the spur of\na sudden remembrance, and in the auspicious but undeniably embarrassing\nmanner in which all the unfledged ones of the village clustered about\nhis retiring footsteps, saluting him continually as one \"James,\" upon\nwhom had been conferred the gratifying title of \"Sunny.\" Thus may the\noutline of the combat be recounted.\n\nFrom each opposing group eleven were chosen as a band, and we of our\ncompany putting on a robe of distinctive green (while they elected to\nbe regarded as an assemblage of brown crickets), we presently came to a\nsuitable spot where the trial was to be decided. So far this person\nhad reasonably assumed that at a preconcerted signal the contest would\nbegin, all rising into the air together, uttering cries of menace,\nbounding unceasingly and in every way displaying the dexterity of our\nproportions. Indeed, in the reasonableness of this expectation it cannot\nbe a matter for reproach to one of the green grass-hoppers--who need not\nbe further indicated--that he had already begun a well-simulated note\nof challenge to those around clad in brown, and to leap upwards in\na preparatory essay, when the ever-alert Sir Philip took him\naffectionately by the arm, on the plea that the seclusion of a\nneighbouring pavilion afforded a desirable shade.\n\nBeyond that point it is difficult to convey an accurately grouped and\nfully spread-out design of the encounter. In itself the scheme and\nintention of counterfeiting the domestic life and rivalries of two\nopposing bands of insects was pleasantly conceived, and might have been\ncarried out with harmonious precision, but, after the manner of these\nremote tribes, the original project had been overshadowed and the purity\nof the imagination lost beneath a mass of inconsistent detail. To\nthis imperfection must it be laid that when at length this person was\nrecalled from the obscurity of the pagoda and the alluring society of\na maiden of the village, to whom he was endeavouring to expound the\nstrategy of the game, and called upon to engage actively in it, he\ncourteously admitted to those who led him forth that he had not the most\nshadowy-outlined idea of what was required of him.\n\nNevertheless they bound about his legs a frilled armour, ingeniously\nfashioned to represent the ribbed leanness of the insect's shank,\nencased his hands and feet in covers to a like purpose, and pressing\nupon him a wooden club indicated that the time had come for him to\nprove his merit by venturing alone into the midst of the eleven brown\nadversaries who stood at a distance in poised and expectant attitudes.\n\nAssuredly, benignant one, this sport of contending locusts began, as one\napproached nearer to it, to wear no more pacific a face than if it had\nbeen a carnage of the hurl-headlong or the curved-hook varieties. In\nsuch a competition, it occurred to him, how little deference would be\npaid to this one's title of \"Established Genius,\" or how inadequately\nwould he be protected by his undoubted capacity of leaping upwards,\nand even in a sideway direction, for no matter how vigorously he\nmight propel himself, or how successfully he might endeavour to remain\nself-sustained in the air, the ill-destined moment could not be long\ndeferred when he must come down again into the midst of the eleven--all\ndoubtless concealing weapons as massive and fatally-destructive as his\nown. This prospect, to a person of quiescent taste, whose chief\ndelight lay in contemplating the philosophical subtleties of the higher\nClassics, was in itself devoid of glamour, but with what funereal\npigments shall he describe his sinking emotions when one of his own\nband, approaching him as he went, whispered in his ear, \"Look out at\nthis end; they kick up like the very devil. And their man behind the\nwicket is really smart; if you give him half a chance he'll have\nyour stumps down before you can say 'knife.'\" Shorn of its uncouth\nfamiliarity, this was a charitable warning that they into whose\nstronghold I was turning my footsteps--perhaps first deceiving my\nalertness with a proffered friendship--would kick with the ferocity of\nuntamed demons, and that one in particular, whose description, to my\nadded despair, I was unable to retain, was known to possess a formidable\nknife, with which it was his intention to cut off this person's legs at\nthe first opportunity, before he could be accused of the act. Truly, \"To\none whom he would utterly destroy Buddha sends a lucky dream.\"\n\nBehind lay the pagoda (though the fact that this one did admittedly turn\nround for a period need not be too critically dwelt upon), with three\ntiers of maidens, some already waving their hands as an encouraging\ntoken; on each side a barrier of prickly growth inopportunely presented\nitself, while in front the eleven kicking crickets stood waiting, and\namong them lurked the one grasping a doubly-edged blade of a highly\nproficient keenness.\n\nThere are occasional moments in the life of a person when he as the\ninward perception of retiring for a few paces and looking back in order\nto consider his general appearance and to judge how he is situated\nwith regard to himself, to review his past life in a spirit of judicial\nseverity, to arrange definitely upon a future composed entirely of acts\nof benevolence, and to examine the working of destiny at large. In such\na scrutiny I now began to understand that it would perhaps have been\nmore harmonious to my love of contemplative repose if I had considered\nthe disadvantages closer before venturing into this barbarian region,\nor, at least, if I had used the occasion profitably to advance an\nargument tending towards a somewhat fuller allowance of taels from your\nbenevolent sleeve. Our own virtuous and flower-strewn land, it is true,\ndoes not possess an immunity from every trifling drawback. The Hoang\nHo--to concede specifically the existence of some of these--frequently\nbursts through its restraining barriers and indiscriminately sweeps\naway all those who are so ill-advised as to dwell within reach of its\nmalignant influence. From time to time wars and insurrections are found\nto be necessary, and no matter how morally-intentioned and humanely\nconducted, they necessarily result in the violation, dismemberment or\nextirpation of many thousand polite and dispassionate persons who have\nno concern with either side. Towns are repeatedly consumed by fire,\ndistricts scourged by leprosy, and provinces swept by famine. The storms\nare admittedly more fatal than elsewhere, the thunderbolts larger, more\nnumerous, and all unerringly directed, while the extremities of heat and\ncold render life really uncongenial for the greater part of each year.\nThe poor, having no money to secure justice, are evilly used, whereas\nthe wealthy, having too much, are assailed legally by the gross\nand powerful for the purpose of extorting their riches. Robbers and\nassassins lurk in every cave; vast hoards of pirates blacken the surface\nof every river; and mandarins of the nine degrees must make a livelihood\nby some means or other. By day, therefore, it is inadvisable to go forth\nand encounter human beings, while none but the shallow-headed would risk\na meeting with the countless demons and vampires which move by night. To\none who has spent many moons among these foreign apparitions the absence\nof drains, roads, illustrated message-parchments, maidens whose voices\nmay be heard protesting upon ringing a wire, loaves of conflicting\ndimensions, persons who strive to put their faces upon every\nadvertisement, pens which emit fountains when carried in the pocket,\na profusion of make-strong foods, and an Encyclopaedia Mongolia, may\nundoubtedly be mentioned as constituting a material deficiency. Affairs\nare not being altogether reputably conducted during the crisis; it can\nnever be quite definitely asserted what the next action of the versatile\nand high-spirited Dowager Empress will be; and here it is freely\ncontended that the Pure and Immortal Empire is incapable of remaining\nin one piece for much longer. These, and other inconveniences of a like\nnature, which the fastidious might distort into actual hardships, have\nnever been denied, yet at no period of the nine thousand years of our\ncivilisation has it been the custom to lure out the unwary, on the plea\nof an agreeable entertainment, and then to abandon him into the society\nof eleven club-bearing adversaries, one of whom may be depicted as in\nthe act of imparting an unnecessary polish to the edge of his already\npreternaturally acute weapon, while those of his own band offer no\nprotection, and three tiers of very richly-dressed maidens encourage him\nto his fate by refined gestures of approval.\n\nDoubtless this person had unconsciously allowed his inner meditations\nto carry him away, as it may be expressed, for when he emerged from this\nstrain of reverie it was to discover himself in the chariot-road and--so\nincongruously may be the actions when the controlling intelligence is\nwithdrawn--even proceeding at a somewhat undignified pace in a direction\nimmediately opposed to an encounter with the brown locusts. From\nthis mortifying position he was happily saved by emerging from these\nthought-dreams before it was too late to return, and, also, if the\ndetail is not too insignificant to be related, by the fact that certain\nchosen runners from his own company had reached a point in the road\nbefore him, and now stood joining their outstretched arms across the\npassage and raising gravity-dispelling cries. Smiling acquiescently,\ntherefore, this person returned in their midst, and receiving a new\nweapon, his own club having been absent-mindedly mislaid, he again set\nforth warily to the encounter.\n\nYet in this he did not altogether neglect a discreet prudence. The\nsympathetic person to whom he was indebted for the pointed allusion had\nspecifically declared that they who used their feet with the desperate\nsavagery of baffled spectres guarded the nearer limits of their\nposition, the intention of his timely hint assuredly being that I should\nseek to approach from the opposite end, where, doubtless, the more\nhumane and conciliatory grass-hoppers were assembled. Thus guided I now\nset forth in a widely-circuitous direction, having the point where I\nmeant to open an attack clearly before my eyes, yet seeking to deliver\na more effective onslaught by reaching it to some extent unperceived and\nto this end creeping forward in the protecting shadow of the long grass\nand untrimmed herbage.\n\nWhether the one already referred to had incapably failed to express his\nreal meaning, or whether he was tremulous by nature and inordinately\nself-deficient, concerns the narration less than the fact that he had\nadmittedly produced a state of things largely in excess of the actual.\nThere is no longer any serviceable pretext for maintaining that\nthose guarding any point of their position were other than mild and\nbenevolent, while the only edged weapon displayed was one courteously\nproduced to aid this person's ineffectual struggles to extricate himself\nwhen, by some obscure movement, he had most ignobly entangled his\npigtail about the claws of his sandal.\n\nIgnorant of this, the true state of things, I was still advancing subtly\nwhen one wearing the emblems of our band appeared from among the brown\ninsects and came towards me. \"Courage!\" I exclaimed in a guarded tone,\nraising my head cautiously and rejoiced to find that I should not be\nalone. \"Here is one clad in green bearing succour, who will, moreover,\nobstinately defend his stumps to the last extremity.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" replied the opportune person agreeably; \"we need a few\nlike that. But do get up on your hind legs and come along, there's a\ngood fellow. You can play at bears in the nursery when we get back, if\nyou want.\"\n\nCertainly one can simulate the movements of wild animals in a\nmarket-garden if the impersonation is thought to be desirable, yet\nthe reasonable analogy of the saying is elusive in the extreme, and\nI followed the ally who had thus betrayed my presence with a deep-set\nmisgiving although in the absence of a more trustworthy guide, and in\nthe suspicion that some point of my every ordinary strategy had been\ninept, I was compelled to mould myself identically into his advice.\n\nScarcely had he left me, and I was endeavouring to dispel any idea of\ntreachery towards those about by actions of graceful courtesy, when\none--unworthy of burial--standing a score of paces distant, (to whom,\nindeed, this person was at the moment bowing with almost passionate\nvehemence, inspired by the conviction that he, for his part, was\nengaged in a like attention,) suddenly cast a missile--which, somewhat\ndouble-facedly, he had hitherto held concealed in his closed hand--with\nundeviating force and accuracy. So unexpected was the movement,\nso painfully-impressed the vindictive contact, that I should have\ninstinctively seized the offensively-directed object and contemptuously\nhurled it back again, if the consequence of the blow had not deprived\nmy mind of all retaliatory ambitions. In this emergency was manifested\na magnanimous act worthy of the incense of a poem, for a person standing\nimmediately by, seeing how this one was balanced in his emotions, picked\nup the missile, and although one of the foremost of the opposing band,\nvery obligingly flung it back at the assailant. Even an outcast would\nnot have passed this without a suitable tribute, and turning to him,\nI was remarking appreciatively that men were not divided by seas and\nwooden barriers, but by the unchecked and conflicting lusts of the mind,\nwhen the unclean and weed-nurtured traitor twenty paces distant, taking\na degraded advantage from this person's attitude, again propelled his\nweapon with an even more concentrated perfidy than before. At this new\noutrage every brown cricket shrank from the attitude of alert vigour\nwhich hitherto he had maintained, and as though to disassociate\nthemselves from the stain of complicity all crossed over and took up new\npositions.\n\nUp to this point, majestic head, in order to represent the adventure\nin its proper sequence, it has been advisable to present the details as\nthey arose before the eyes of a reliable and dispassionate gazer. Now,\nhowever, it is no less seemly to declare that this barbarian sport\nof leaping insects is not so discreditably shallow as it had at first\nappeared, while in every action there may be found an apt but hidden\nsymbol. Thus the presence of the two green locusts in the midst of\nothers of a dissimilar nature represents the unending strife by which\neven the most pacific are ever surrounded. The fragile erection of\nsticks (behind which this person at first sought to defend himself\nuntil led into a more exposed position by one garbed in white,) may be\nregarded as the home and altar, and adequately depicts the hollowness\nof the protection it affords and the necessity of reliantly emerging to\ndefy an invader rather than lurking discreditably among its recesses.\nThe missile is the equivalent of a precise and immediate danger, the\nwooden club the natural instinct for defence with which all living\ncreatures are endowed, so that when the peril is for the time driven\naway the opportunity is at hand for the display of virtuous amusements,\nthe exchanging of hospitality, and the beating of professional drums as\nwe would say. Thus, at the next attack the one sharing the enterprise\nwith me struck the missile so proficiently that its recovery engaged the\nattention of all our adversaries, and then began to exhibit his powers\nby running and leaping towards me. Recognising that the actual moment of\nthe display had arrived, this person at once emitted a penetrating cry\nof concentrated challenge, and also began to leap upwards and about,\nand with so much energy that the highly achieved limits of his flight\nsurprised even himself.\n\nAs for the bystanders, esteemed, those who opposed us, and the members\nof our own band, although this leaping sportiveness is a competition\nmore regarded and practised among all orders than the pursuit of\ncommercial eminence, or even than the allurements of the sublimest\nClassics, it may be truly imagined that never before had they witnessed\nso remarkable a game cricket. From the pagoda a loud cry of wonder\nacclaimed the dexterity of this person's efforts; the three tiers of\nmaidens climbed one upon another in their anxiety to lose no detail of\nthe adventure, and outstanders from distant points began to assemble.\nThe brown enemy at once abandoned themselves to a panic, and for the\nmost part cast themselves incapably to the ground, rolling from side to\nside in an access of emotion; the two arbiters clad in white conferred\ntogether, doubtless on the uselessness of further contest, while the\nally who had summoned me to take a part instead of being encouraged to\ndisplay his agility in a like manner continued to run slavishly from\npoint to point, while I overcame the distances in a series of inspired\nbounds.\n\nIn the meanwhile the sounds of encouragement from the ever-increasing\nmultitude grew like the falling of a sudden coast storm among the ripe\nleaves of a tea-plantation, and with them the voices of many calling\nupon my name and inciting me to further and even higher achievements\nreached my ears. Not to grow small in the eyes of these estimable\npersons I continued in my flight, and abandoning all set movements and\nlimits, I began to traverse the field in every direction, becoming more\nproficient with each effort, imparting to myself a sideway and even\nbackward motion while yet in the upper spaces, remaining poised for an\nappreciable period, and lightly, yet with graceful ease, avoiding the\nembraces of those who would have detained me. Undoubtedly I could have\nmaintained this supremacy until our band might justly have claimed the\nreward, had not the flattering cries of approval caused an indiscreet\nmistake, for the alarm being spread in the village that a conflagration\nof imposing ferocity was raging, an ornamental chariot conveying a band\nof warriors clad in brass armour presently entered into the strife, and\ndiscovering no fire to occupy their charitable energies they misguidedly\nhonoured this offensive person by propelling a solid column of the\npurest and most refreshing water against his ignoble body when at the\npoint of his highest flight. This introduction of a thunderbolt into the\neveryday life of an insect must be of questionable authenticity, yet\nnot feeling sufficiently instructed in the lesser details of the\nsportiveness to challenge the device, I suffered myself to be led\ntowards the pavilion with no more struggling than enough to remove the\nignominy of an unresisting surrender, pleasantly remarking to those\nwho bore me along that to a person of philosophical poise the written\ndestiny was as apparent in the falling leaf as in the rising sun,\npointing the saying thus: \"Although the Desert of Shan-tz is boundless,\nand mankind number a million million, yet in it Li-hing encountered his\nmother-in-law.\" Changing to meet another of our company setting forth\nwith a club to make the venture, I was permitted for a moment to\nengage him; whereupon thrusting into his hand a leather charm against\nill-directed efforts, and instructing him to bind it about his head, I\nencouraged him with the imperishable watch-word of the Emperor Tsin Su,\n\"The stars are indeed small, but their light carries as far as that of\nthe full moon.\"\n\nAt the steps of the pagoda so great was the throng of those who would\nhave overwhelmed me with their gracious attention, that had not this\nperson's neck become practically automatic by ceaseless use of late, he\nwould have been utterly unequal to the emergency. As it was, he could\nonly bestow a superficial hand-wave upon a company of gold-embroidered\nmusicians who greeted his return with appropriate melody, and a glance\nof well-indicated regret that he had no fuller means of conveying his\ncomplicated emotions, in the direction of the uppermost tier of maidens.\nThen the awaiting Sir Philip took him firmly towards the inner part of\nthe pavilion, and announced, so adroitly and with such high-spirited\nvigour had this one maintained the conflict, that it had been resolutely\nagreed on all sides not to make a test of his competence any further.\n\nThereupon a band of very sumptuously arrayed nymphs drew near with\nofferings of liquid fat and a variety of crimson fruit, which it is\ncustomary to grind together on the platter--unapproachable in the\nresult, certainly, yet incredibly elusive to the unwary in the manner of\nbruising, and practically ineradicable upon the more delicate shades\nof silk garment. In such a situation the one who is now relating the\nvarious incidents of the day may be imagined by a broad-minded and\naffectionate sire: partaking of this native fruit and oil, and from time\nto time expressing his insatiable anguish that he continually fails\nto become more proficient in controlling the oblique movements of the\nviands, while the less successful crickets are constrained to persevere\nin the combat, and the ever-present note of evasive purport is raised\nby a voice from behind a screen exclaiming, \"Out afore? That he may have\nbeen, but do he think we was a-going to give he out afore? No, maaster,\nus doant a-have a circus every day hereabouts.\"\n\nThus may this imagination of competitive locusts be set forth to\nthe end. If a fuller proof of what an unostentatious self-effacement\nhesitates to enlarge upon were required, it might be found in the\nbarbarian printed leaf, for the next day this person saw a public record\nof the strife, in which his own name was followed by a numerical emblem\nsignifying that he had not stumbled or proved incompetent in any one\nparticular. Sir Philip, I beheld with pained surprise, had obtusely\nsuffered himself to be caught out in the committal of fifty-nine set\noffences.\n\nWith a not unnatural anticipation that, as a result of this painstaking\ndescription, this person will find two well-equipped camps of contending\nlocusts in Yuen-ping on his return.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XII\n\n\n Concerning the obvious misunderstanding which has entwined\n itself about a revered parent's faculties of passionless\n discrimination. The all-water disportment and the two, of\n different sexes, who after regarding me conflictingly from\n the beginning, ended in a like but inverted manner.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--Your gem-adorned letter containing a thousand burnished\nwords of profuse reproach has entered my diminished soul in the form\nof an equal number of rusty barbs. Can it be that the incapable\nperson whom, as you truly say, you sent, \"to observe the philosophical\nsubtleties of the barbarians, to study their dynastical records and to\nassociate liberally with the venerable and dignified,\" has, in your\nown unapproachable felicity of ceremonial expression, \"according to\na discreet whisper from many sources, chiefly affected the society of\ntea-house maidens, the immature of both sexes, doubtful characters of\nall classes, and criminals awaiting trial; has evinced an unswerving\naffinity towards light amusement and entertainments of a no-class kind;\nand in place of a wise aloofness, befitting a wearer of the third Gold\nButton and the Horn Belt-clasp, in situations of critical perplexity,\nseems by his own ingenuous showing to have maintained an unparalleled\naptitude for behaving either with the crystalline simplicity of a\nKan-su earth-tiller, or the misplaced buffoonery of a seventh-grade\nbody-writher taking the least significant part in an ill-equipped Swatow\none-cash Hall of Varied Melodies.\" Assuredly, if your striking and\nwell-chosen metaphors were not more unbalanced than the ungainly\nattitude of a one-legged hunchback crossing a raging torrent by means\nof a slippery plank on a stormy night, they would cause the very acutest\nbitterness to the throat of a dutiful and always high-stepping son.\nThere is an apt saying, however, \"A quarrel between two soldiers in the\nmarket-place becomes a rebellion in the outskirts,\" and when this person\nremembers that many thousand li of mixed elements flow between him and\nhis usually correct and dispassionate sire, he is impelled to take a\nmild and tolerant attitude towards the momentary injustice brought about\nby the weakness of approaching old age, the vile-intentioned mendacity\nof outcasts envious of the House of Kong, and, perchance, the irritation\nbrought on by a too lavish indulgence in your favourite dish of stewed\nmouse.\n\nHaving thus re-established himself in the clear-sighted affection of an\never mild and perfect father, and cleansed the ground of all possible\nmisunderstandings in the future, this person will concede the fact that,\nnot to stand beneath the faintest shadow of an implied blemish in your\nsympathetic eyes, he had no sooner understood the attitude in which he\nhad been presented than he at once plunged into the virtuous society of\na band of the sombre and benevolent.\n\nThese, so far as his intelligence enables him to grasp the position,\nmay be reasonably accepted as the barbarian equivalent of those very\nhigh-minded persons who in our land devote their whole lives secretly\nto killing others whom they consider the chief deities do not really\napprove of; for although they are not permitted here, either by written\nlaw or by accepted custom, to perform these meritorious actions, they\nare so intimately initiated into the minds and councils of the Upper\nOnes that they are able to pronounce very severe judgments of torture--a\nmuch heavier penalty than merely being assassinated--upon all who remain\noutside their league. As some of the most objurgatory of these alliances\ndo not number more than a score of persons, it is inevitable that the\nultimate condition of the whole barbarian people must be hazardous in\nthe extreme.\n\nHaving associated myself with this class sufficiently to escape their\nvindictive pronouncements, and freely professed an unswerving adherence\nto their rites, I next sought out the priests of other altars, intending\nby a seemly avowal to each in turn to safeguard my future existence\neffectually. This I soon discovered to be beyond the capacity of an\nordinary lifetime, for whereas we, with four hundred million subjects\nfind three religions to be sufficient to meet every emergency, these\nirresolute island children, although numbering us only as one to ten,\nvacillate among three hundred; and even amid this profusion it is\nasserted that most of the barbarians are unable to find any temple\nexactly conforming to their requirements, and after writing to the paper\nto announce the fact, abandon the search in despair.\n\nIt was while I was becoming proficient in the inner subtleties of one\nof these orders--they who drink water on all occasions and wear a\nbadge--that a maiden of some authority among them besought my aid for\nthe purpose of amusing a band which she was desirous of propitiating\ninto the adoption of this badge. It is possible that in the immature\nconfidence of former letters this person may already have alluded to\ncertain maidens with words of courteous esteem, but it is now necessary\nto admit finally that in the presence of this same Helena they would\nall appear as an uninviting growth of stunted and deformed poppies\nsurrounding a luxuriant chrysanthemum. At the presumptuous thought of\ndescribing her illimitable excellences my fingers become claw-like in\ntheir confessed inadequacy to hold a sufficiently upright brush; yet\nwithout undue confidence it may be set down that her hands resembled the\ntwo wings of a mandarin drake in their symmetrical and changing motion,\nher hair as light and radiant-pointed as the translucent incense cloud\nfloating before the golden Buddha of Shan-Si, thin white satin stretched\ntightly upon polished agate only faintly comparable to her jade cheeks,\nwhile her eyes were more unfathomable than the crystal waters of the\nKeng-kiang, and within their depths her pure and magnanimous thoughts\ncould be dimly seen to glide like the gold and silver carp beneath the\nsacred river.\n\nWhen this insurpassable being approached me with the flattering\npetition already alluded to, my gratified emotions clashed together\nuncontrollably with the internal feeling of many volcanoes in movement,\nand my organs of expression became so entangled at the condescension of\nher melodious voice being directly addressed to one so degraded, that\nfor several minutes I was incapable of further acquiescence than that\nconveyed by an adoring silence and an unchanging smile. No formality\nappeared worthy to greet her by, no expression of self-contempt\nsufficiently offensive to convey to her enlightenment my own sense of\na manifold inferiority, and doubtless I should have remained in a\ntransfixed attitude until she had at length turned aside, had not your\nseasonable reference to a Swatow limb-contorter struck me heavily and\nabruptly turned off the source of my agreement. Might not this all-water\nentertainment, it occurred to this one, consist in enticing him to drink\na potion made unsuspectedly hot, in projecting him backwards into a vat\nof the same liquid, or some similar device for the pleasurable amusement\nof those around, which would come within the boundaries of your refined\ndisapproval? As one by himself there was no indignity that this person\nwould not cheerfully have submitted to, but the inexorable cords of an\ningrained filial regard suddenly pulled him sideways and into another\ndirection.\n\n\"But, Mr. Kong,\" exclaimed the bee-lipped maiden, when I had explained\n(as being less involved to her imagination,) that I was under a vow,\n\"we have been relying upon you. Could you not\"--and here she dropped her\neyes and picked them up again with a fluttering motion which our lesser\nones are, to an all-wise end, quite unacquainted with--\"could you not\nunvow yourself for one night, just to please ME?\"\n\nAt these words, the illuminated proficiency of her glance, and her\nhonourable resolution to implicate me in the display by head or feet,\nthe ever-revered image of a just and obedience-loving father ceased to\nhave any further tangible influence. Let it be remembered that there\nis a deep saying, \"A virtuous woman will cause more evil than ten river\npirates.\" As for the person who is recording his incompetence, the room\nand all those about began to engulf him in an ever-increasing circular\nmotion, his knees vibrated together with unrestrained pliancy, and\nconcentrating his voice to indicate by the allegory some faint measure\nof his emotion, he replied passionately, \"Let the amusement referred to\ntake the form of sitting in a boiling cauldron exposed to the derision\nof all beholders, this one will now enter it wearing yellow silk\ntrousers.\"\n\nIt is characteristic of these illogical out-countries that the all-water\ndiversion did not, as a matter to record, concern itself with that\nliquid in any detail, beyond the contents of a glass vessel from which a\nvenerable person, who occupied a raised chair, continually partook. This\ndiscriminating individual spoke so confidently of the beneficial action\nof the fluid, and so unswervingly described my own feelings at the\nmoment--as of head giddiness, an inexactitude of speech, and no clear\ndefinition of where the next step would be arrived at--as the common\nlot of all who did not consume regularly, that when that same Helena\nhad passed on to speak to another, I left the hall unobserved and drank\nsuccessive portions, in each case, as the night was cold, prudently\nadding a measure of the native rice spirit. His advice had been\nwell-directed, for with the fourth portion I suddenly found all\ndoubtful and oppressive visions withdrawn, and a new and exhilarating\nself-confidence raised in their place. In this agreeable temper I\nreturned to the place of meeting to find a priest of one of the lesser\norders relating a circumstance whereby he had encountered a wild maiden\nin the woods, who had steadfastly persisted that she was one of a\nband of seven (this being the luckiest protective number among the\nsuperstitious). Though unable to cause their appearance, she had gone\nthrough a most precise examination at his hands without deviating in the\nslightest particular, whereupon distrusting the outcome of the strife,\nthe person who was relating the adventure had withdrawn breathless.\n\nWhen this versatile lesser priest had finished the narration, and\nthe applause, which clearly showed that those present approved of the\nsolitary maiden's discreet stratagem, had ceased, the one who occupied\nthe central platform, rising, exclaimed loudly, \"Mr. Kong will next\nfavour us with a contribution, which will consist, I am informed, of a\nChinese tale.\"\n\nNow there chanced to be present a certain one who had already become\noffensive to me by the systematic dexterity with which he had planted\nhis inopportune shadow between the sublime-souled Helena and any other\nwho made a movement to approach her heaven-dowered outline. When this\npresumptuous and ill-nurtured outcast, who was, indeed, then seated\nby the side of the enchanting maiden last referred to, heard the\nannouncement he said in a voice feigned to reach her peach-skin ear\nalone, yet intentionally so modulated as to penetrate the furthest limit\nof the room, \"A Chinese tale! Why, assuredly, that must be a pig-tail.\"\nAt this unseemly shaft many of those present allowed themselves to\nbecome immoderately amused, and even the goat-like sage who had\ncalled upon my name concealed his face behind an open hand, but the\namiably-disposed Helena, after looking at the undiscriminating youth\ncoldly for a moment, deliberately rose and moved to a vacant spot at a\ndistance. Encouraged by this fragrant act of sympathy I replied with a\npolite bow to indicate the position, \"On the contrary, the story which\nit is now my presumptuous intention to relate will contain no reference\nwhatever to the carefully-got-up one occupying two empty seats in the\nfront row,\" and without further introduction began the history of Kao\nand his three brothers, to which I had added the title, \"The Three\nGifts.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of this classical example of the snares ever lying\naround the footsteps of the impious, I perceived that the jocular\nstripling, whom I had so delicately reproved, was no longer present.\nDoubtless he had been unable to remain in the same room with the\ncommanding Helena's high-spirited indignation, and anticipating that in\nconsequence there would now be no obstacle to her full-faced benignity,\nI drew near with an appropriate smile.\n\nIt is somewhere officially recorded, \"There is only one man who knew\nwith accurate certainty what a maiden's next attitude would be, and he\ndied young of surprise.\" As I approached I had the sensation of passing\ninto so severe an atmosphere of rigid disfavour, that the ingratiating\nlines upon my face became frozen in its intensity, despite the ineptness\nof their expression. Unable to penetrate the cause of my offence, I\nmade a variety of agreeable remarks, until finding that nothing tended\ntowards a becoming reconciliation, I gradually withdrew in despair, and\nagain turned my face in the direction of that same accommodation which I\nhad already found beneath the sign of an Encompassed Goat. Here, by the\nsarcasm of destiny, I encountered the person who had drawn the slighting\nanalogy between this one's pig-tail and his ability as a story-teller.\nFor a brief space of time the ultimate development of the venture\nwas doubtfully poised, but recognising in each other's features the\noverhanging cloud of an allied pang, the one before me expressed a\nbecoming contrition for the jest, together with a proffered cup. Not to\nappear out-classed I replied in a suitable vein, involving the supply\nof more vessels; whereupon there succeeded many more vessels, called for\nboth singly and in harmonious unison, and the reappearance of numerous\nbright images, accompanied by a universal scintillation of meteor-like\niridescence. In this genial and greatly-enlarged spirit we returned\naffably together to the hall, and entered unperceived at the moment when\nthe one who made the announcements was crying aloud, \"According to the\nprogramme the next item should have been a Chinese poem, but as Mr. Kong\nHo appears to have left the building, we shall pass him over--\"\n\n\"What Ho?\" exclaimed the somewhat impetuous one by my side, stepping\nforward indignantly and mounting the platform in his affectionate zeal.\n\"No one shall pass over my old and valued friend--this Ho--while I have\na paw to raise. Step forward, Mandarin, and let them behold the inventor\nand sole user of the justly far-famed G. R. Ko-Ho hair restorer--sent in\nfive guinea bottles to any address on receipt of four penny stamps--as\nhe appeared in his celebrated impersonation of the human-faced Swan at\nDoll and Edgar's. Come on, oh, Ho!\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" I replied, striving to follow him, \"yet with the wary\ngreeting, 'Slowly, slowly; walk slowly,' engraved upon my mind, for the\nbarrier of these convoluted stairs--\" but at this word a band of maidens\npassed out hastily, and in the tumult I reached the dais and began\nWeng Chi's immortal verses, entitled \"The Meandering Flight,\" which had\noccupied me three complete days and nights in the detail of rendering\nthe allusions into well-balanced similitudes and at the same time\npreserving the skilful evasion of all conventional rules which raises\nthe original to so sublime a height.\n\n The voice of one singing at the dawn;\n The seven harmonious colours in the sky;\n The meeting by the fountain;\n The exchange of gifts, and the sound of the processional drum;\n The emotion of satisfaction in each created being;\n This is the all-prominent indication of the Spring.\n\n The general disinclination to engage in laborious tasks;\n The general readiness to consume voluminous potions on any\n pretext.\n The deserted appearance of the city and the absence of the\n come-in motion at every door;\n The sportiveness of maidens, and even those of maturer age,\n ethereally clad, upon the shore.\n The avowed willingness of merchants to dispose of their wares\n for half the original sum.\n This undoubtedly is the Summer.\n\n The yellow tea leaf circling as it falls;\n The futile wheeling of the storm-tossed swan;\n The note of the marble lute at evening by the pool;\n The immobile cypress seen against the sun.\n The unnecessarily difficult examination paper.\n All these things are suggestive of the Autumn.\n\n The growing attraction of a well-lined couch.\n The obsequious demeanour of message-bearers, charioteers, and\n the club-armed keepers of peace.\n The explosion of innumerable fire-crackers round the convivial\n shines,\n The gathering together of relations who at all other times\n shun each other markedly.\n The obtrusive recollection of a great many things contrary to\n a spoken vow, and the inflexible purpose to be more\n resolute in future.\n These in turn invariably attend each Winter.\n\nIt certainly had not presented itself to me before that the words\n\"invariably attend\" are ill-chosen, but as I would have uttered them\ntheir inelegance became plain, and this person made eight conscientious\nattempts to soften down their harsh modulation by various interchanges.\nHe was still persevering hopefully when he of chief authority approached\nand requested that the one who was thus employed and that same other\nwould leave the hall tranquilly, as the all-water entertainment was\nat an end, and an attending slave was in readiness to extinguish the\nlanterns.\n\n\"Yet,\" I protested unassumingly, \"that which has so far been expressed\nis only in the semblance of an introductory ode. There follow--\"\n\n\"You must not argue with the Chair,\" exclaimed another interposing his\nvoice. \"Whatever the Chair rules must be accepted.\"\n\n\"The innuendo is flat-witted,\" I replied with imperturbable dignity, but\nstill retaining my hold upon the rail. \"When this person so far loses\nhis sense of proportion as to contend with an irrational object, devoid\nof faculties, let the barb be cast. After that introduction dealing with\nthe four seasons, the twelve gong-strokes of the day are reviewed in a\nlike fashion. These in turn give place to the days of the month, then\nthe moons of the year, and finally the years of the cycle.\"\n\n\"That's fair,\" exclaimed the perverse though well-meaning youth, whom I\nwas beginning to recognise as the cause of some misunderstanding among\nus. \"If you don't want any more of his poem--and I don't blame you--my\npal Ho, who is one of the popular Flip-Flap Troupe, offers to do some\ntrick cycle-riding on his ears. What more can you expect?\"\n\n\"We expect a policeman very soon,\" replied another severely. \"He has\nalready been sent for.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the one who had so persistently claimed me as\nan ally, \"perhaps I can do you a service by directing him here\"; and\nleaving this person to extricate himself by means of a reassuring\nsilence and some of the larger silver pieces of the Island, he vanished\nhastily.\n\nWith some doubt whether or not this deviation into the society of the\nprofessedly virtuous, ending as it admittedly does in an involvement,\nmay not be deemed ill-starred; yet hopeful.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n THE THREE GIFTS\n\n Related by Kong Ho on the occasion of the all-water\n disportment, under the circumstances previously set forth.\n\nBEYOND the limits of the township of Yang-chow there dwelt a rich\nastrologer named Wei. Reading by his skilful interpretation of the\nplanets that he would shortly Pass Above, he called his sons Chu, Shan,\nand Hing to his side and distributed his wealth impartially among them.\nTo Chu he gave his house containing a gold couch; to Shan a river with\na boat; to Hing a field in which grew a prolific orange-tree. \"Thus\nprovided for,\" he continued, \"you will be able to live together in\ncomfort, the resources of each supplying the wants of the others in\naddition to his own requirements. Therefore when I have departed let it\nbe your first care to sacrifice everything else I leave, so that I also,\nin the Upper Air, may not be left destitute.\"\n\nNow in addition to these three sons Wei also had another, the youngest,\nbut one of so docile, respectful, and self-effacing a disposition that\nhe was frequently overlooked to the advantage of his subtle, ambitious,\nand ingratiating brothers. This youth, Kao, thinking that the occasion\ncertainly called for a momentary relaxation of his usual diffidence,\nnow approached his father modestly, and begged that he also might be\nincluded to some trivial degree in his bounty.\n\nThis reasonable petition involved Wei in an embarrassing perplexity.\nAlthough he had forgotten Kao completely in the division, he had now\ndefinitely concluded the arrangement; nor, to his failing powers, did it\nappear possible to make a just allotment on any other lines. \"How can a\nperson profitably cut up an orange-tree, a boat, an inlaid couch, or\na house?\" he demanded. \"Who can divide a flowing river, or what but\nunending strife can arise from regarding an open field in anything\nbut its entirety? Assuredly six cohesive objects cannot be apportioned\nbetween four persons.\" Yet he could not evade the justice of Kao's\nimplied rebuke, so drawing to his side a jade cabinet he opened it, and\nfrom among the contents he selected an ebony staff, a paper umbrella,\nand a fan inscribed with a mystical sentence. These three objects he\nplaced in Kao's hands, and with his last breath signified that he should\nuse them discreetly as the necessity arose.\n\nWhen the funeral ceremonies were over, Chu, Shan, and Hing came\ntogether, and soon moulded their covetous thoughts into an agreed\nconspiracy. \"Of what avail would be a boat or a river if this person\nsacrificed the nets and appliances by which the fish are ensnared?\"\nasked Shan. \"How little profit would lie in an orange-tree and a field\nwithout cattle and the implements of husbandry!\" cried Hing. \"One cannot\noccupy a gold couch in an empty house both by day and night,\" remarked\nChu stubbornly. \"How inadequate, therefore, would such a provision be\nfor three.\"\n\nWhen Kao understood that his three brothers had resolved to act in this\noutrageous manner he did not hesitate to reproach them; but not being\nable to contend against him honourably, they met him with ridicule.\n\"Do not attempt to rule us with your wooden staff,\" they cried\ncontemptuously. \"Sacrifice IT if your inside is really sincere. And,\nin the meanwhile, go and sit under your paper umbrella and wield\nyour inscribed fan, while we attend to our couch, our boat, and our\norange-tree.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" thought Kao to himself when they had departed, \"their words\nwere irrationally offensive, but among them there may stand out a\npointed edge. Our magnanimous father is now bereft of both comforts\nand necessities, and although an ebony rod is certainly not much in the\ncircumstances, if this person is really humanely-intentioned he will not\nwithhold it.\" With this charitable design Kao build a fire before the\ncouch (being desirous, out of his forgiving nature, to associate his\neldest brother in the offering), and without hesitation sacrificed the\nmost substantial of his three possessions.\n\nIt here becomes necessary to explain that in addition to being an expert\nastrologer, Wei was a far-seeing magician. The rod of unimpressionable\nsolidity was in reality a charm against decay, and its hidden virtues\nbeing thus destroyed, a contrary state of things naturally arose, so\nthat the next morning it was found that during the night the gold couch\nhad crumbled away into a worthless dust.\n\nEven this manifestation did not move the three brothers, although the\ngeniality of Shan and Hing's countenances froze somewhat towards Chu.\nNevertheless Chu still possessed a house, and by pointing out that they\ncould live as luxuriantly as before on the resources of the river and\nthe field and the tree, he succeeded in maintaining his position among\nthem.\n\nAfter seven days Kao reflected again. \"This avaricious person still has\ntwo objects, both of which he owes to his revered father's imperishable\ninfluence,\" he admitted conscience-stricken, \"while the being in\nquestion has only one.\" Without delay he took the paper umbrella and\nceremoniously burned it, scattering the ashes this time upon Shan's\nriver. Like the rod the umbrella also possessed secret virtues, its\nparticular excellence being a curse against clouds, wind demons,\nthunderbolts and the like, so that during the night a great storm raged,\nand by the morning Shan's boat had been washed away.\n\nThis new calamity found the three brothers more obstinately perverse\nthan ever. It cannot be denied that Hing would have withdrawn from the\nguilty confederacy, but they were as two to one, and prevailed, pointing\nout that the house still afforded shelter, the river yielded some of the\nsimpler and inferior fish which could be captured from the banks, and\nthe fruitfulness of the orange-tree was undiminished.\n\nAt the end of seven more days Kao became afflicted with doubt. \"There is\nno such thing as a fixed proportion or a set reckoning between a dutiful\nson and an embarrassed sire,\" he confessed penitently. \"How incredibly\nprofane has been this person's behaviour in not seeing the obligation in\nits unswerving necessity before.\" With this scrupulous resolve Kao took\nhis last possession, and carrying it into the field he consumed it\nwith fire beneath Hing's orange-tree. The fan, in turn, also had hidden\nproperties, its written sentence being a spell against drought, hot\nwinds, and the demons which suck the nourishment from all crops. In\nconsequence of the act these forces were called into action, and before\nanother day Hing's tree had withered away.\n\nIt is said with reason, \"During the earthquake men speak the truth.\" At\nthis last disaster the impious fortitude of the three brothers suddenly\ngave way, and cheerfully admitting their mistake, each committed\nsuicide, Chu disembowelling himself among the ashes of his couch, Shan\nsinking beneath the waters of his river, and Hing hanging by a rope\namong the branches of his own effete orange-tree.\n\nWhen they had thus fittingly atoned for their faults the imprecation was\nlifted from off their possessions. The couch was restored by magic\nart to its former condition, the boat was returned by a justice-loving\nperson into whose hands it had fallen lower down the river, and\nthe orange-tree put out new branches. Kao therefore passed into an\nundiminished inheritance. He married three wives, to commemorate the\nnumber of his brothers, and had three sons, whom he called Chu, Shan,\nand Hing, for a like purpose. These three all attained to high office in\nthe State, and by their enlightened morals succeeded in wiping all the\ndiscreditable references to others bearing the same names from off the\ndomestic tablets.\n\nFrom this story it will be seen that by acting virtuously, yet with an\nobserving discretion, on all occasions, it is generally possible not\nonly to rise to an assured position, but at the same time unsuspectedly\nto involve those who stand in our way in a just destruction.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XIII\n\n\n Concerning a state of necessity; the arisings engendered\n thereby, and the turned-away face of those ruling the\n literary quarter of the city towards one possessing a style.\n This foreign manner of feigning representations, and\n concerning my dignified portrayal of two.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--It is now more than three thousand years ago that the\nsublime moralist Tcheng How, on being condemned by a resentful official\nto a lengthy imprisonment in a very inadequate oil jar, imperturbably\nreplied, \"As the snail fits his impliant shell, so can the wise adapt\nthemselves to any necessity,\" and at once coiled himself up in the\nrestricted space with unsuspected agility. In times of adversity this\nincomparable reply has often shone as a steadfast lantern before my\nfeet, but recently it struck my senses with a heavier force, for\nupon presenting myself on the last occasion at the place of exchange\nfrequented by those who hitherto have carried out your spoken promise\nwith obliging exactitude, and at certain stated intervals freely granted\nto this person a sufficiency of pieces of gold, merely requiring\nin return an inscribed and signet-bearing record of the fact, I was\nreceived with no diminution of sympathetic urbanity, indeed, but with\nhands quite devoid of outstretched fulness.\n\nIn a small inner chamber, to which I was led upon uttering courteous\nprotests, one of solitary authority explained how the deficiency had\narisen, but owing to the skill with which he entwined the most intricate\nterms in unbroken fluency, the only impression left upon my superficial\nmind was, that the person before me was imputing the scheme for\nmy despoilment less to any mercenary instinct on the part of his\nconfederates, than to a want of timely precision maintained by one who\nseemed to bear an agreeable-sounding name somewhat similar to your own,\nand who, from the difficulty of reaching his immediate ear, might be\nregarded as dwelling in a distant land. Encouraged by this conciliatory\nprofession (and seeing no likelihood of gaining my end otherwise), I\nthereupon declared my willingness that the difference lying between us\nshould be submitted to the pronouncement of dispassionate omens, either\npassing birds, flat and round sticks, the seeds of two oranges, wood and\nfire, water poured out upon the ground or any equally reliable sign as\nhe himself might decide. However, in spite of his honourable assurances,\nhe was doubtless more deeply implicated in the adventure than he\nwould admit, for at this scrupulous proposal the benignant mask of his\nexpression receded abruptly, and, striking a hidden bell, he waved his\nhands and stood up to signify that further justice was denied me.\n\nIn this manner a state of destitution calling for the fullest acceptance\nof Tcheng How's impassive philosophy was created, nor had many\nhours faded before the first insidious temptation to depart from his\nuncompromising acquiescence presented itself.\n\nAt that time there was no one in whom I reposed a larger-sized piece\nof confidence (in no way involving sums of money,) than one officially\nstyled William Beveledge Greyson, although, profiting by our own custom,\nit is unusual for those really intimate with his society to address him\nfully, unless the occasion should be one of marked ceremony. Forming a\nresolution, I now approached this obliging person, and revealing to him\nthe cause of the emergency, I prayed that he would advise me, as one\nabandoned on a strange Island, by what handicraft or exercise of skill I\nmight the readiest secure for the time a frugal competence.\n\n\"Why, look here, aged man,\" at once replied the lavish William Greyson,\n\"don't worry yourself about that. I can easily let you have a few pounds\nto tide you over. You will probably hear from the bank in the course\nof a few days or weeks, and it's hardly worth while doing anything\neccentric in the meantime.\"\n\nAt this delicately-worded proposal I was about to shake hands with\nmyself in agreement, when the memory of Tcheng How's resolute submission\nagain possessed me, and seeing that this would be an unworthy betrayal\nof destiny I turned aside the action, and replying evasively that the\nworld was too small to hold himself and another equally magnanimous, I\nagain sought his advice.\n\n\"Now what silly upside-down idea is it that you've got into that Chinese\npuzzle you call your head, Kong?\" he replied; for this same William was\none who habitually gilded unpalatable truths into the semblance of\na flattering jest. \"Whenever you turn off what you are saying into\na willow-pattern compliment and bow seventeen times like an animated\nmandarin, I know that you are keeping something back. Be a man and\na brother, and out with it,\" and he struck me heavily upon the left\nshoulder, which among the barbarians is a proof of cordiality to be\nesteemed much above the mere wagging of each other's hands.\n\n\"In the matter of guidance,\" I replied, \"this person is ready to sit\nunreservedly on your well-polished feet. But touching the borrowing of\nmoney, obligations to restore with an added sum after a certain period,\ninitial-bearing papers of doubtful import, and the like, I have read too\ndeeply the pointed records of your own printed sheets not to prefer\nan existence devoted to the scraping together of dust at the street\ncorners, rather than a momentary affluence which in the end would betray\nme into the tiger-like voracity of a native money-lender.\"\n\n\"Well, you do me proud, Kong,\" said William Beveledge, after regarding\nme fixedly for a moment. \"If I didn't remember that you are a\nflat-faced, slant-eyed, top-side-under, pig-tailed old heathen, I should\nbe really annoyed at your unwarrantable personalities. Do you take ME\nfor what you call a 'native money-lender'?\"\n\n\"The pronouncements of destiny are written in iron,\" I replied\ninoffensively, \"and it is as truly said that one fated to end his life\nin a cave cannot live for ever on the top of a pagoda. Undoubtedly as\none born and residing here you are native, and as inexorably it succeeds\nthat if you lend me pieces of gold you become a money-lender. Therefore,\nthough honourably inspired at the first, you would equally be drawn into\nthe entanglement of circumstance, and the unevadible end must inevitably\nbe that against which your printed papers consistently warn one.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" asked Beveledge Greyson, still regarding me closely,\nas though I were a creature of another part.\n\n\"At first,\" I replied, \"there would be an alluring snare of graceful\nwords, tea, and the consuming of paper-rolled herbs, and the matter\nwould be lightly spoken of as capable of an easy adjustment; which,\nindeed, it cannot be denied, is how the detail stands at present. The\nnext position would be that this person, finding himself unable to\ngather together the equivalent of return within the stated time, would\ngreet you with a very supple neck and pray for a further extension,\nwhich would be permitted on the understanding that in the event of\nfailure his garments and personal charms should be held in bondage. To\nescape so humiliating a necessity, as the time drew near I would address\nmyself to another, one calling himself William, perchance, and dwelling\nin a northern province, to whom I would be compelled to assign my\npeach-orchard at Yuen-ping. Then by varying degrees of infamy I would\nin turn be driven to visit a certain Bevel of the Middle Lands, a person\nEdge carrying on his insatiable traffic on the southern coast, one Grey\nelsewhere, and a Mr. Son, of the west, who might make an honourable\nprofession of lending money without any security whatever, but who in\nthe end would possess himself of my ancestral tablets, wives, and inlaid\ncoffin, and probably also obtain a lien upon my services and prosperity\nin the Upper Air. Then, when I had parted from all comfort in this\nlife, and every hope of affluence in the Beyond, it would presently\nbe disclosed that all these were in reality as one person who had\nunceasingly plotted to my destruction, and William Beveledge Greyson\nwould stand revealed in the guise of a malevolent vampire. Truly that\ndevelopment has at this moment an appearance of unreality, and worthy\neven of pooh-pooh, but thus is the warning spread by your own printed\npapers and the records of your Halls of Justice, and it would be an\nunseemly presumption for one of my immature experience to ignore the\noutstretched and warning finger of authority.\"\n\n\"Well, Kong,\" he said at length, after considering my words attentively,\n\"I always thought that your mental outlook was a hash of Black Art,\npaper lanterns, blank verse, twilight, and delirium tremens, but hang me\nif you aren't sound on finance, and I only wish that you'd get some of\nmy friends to look at the matter of borrowing in your own reasonable,\nbroad-minded light. The question is, what next?\"\n\nI replied that I leaned heavily against his sagacious insight, adding,\nhowever, that even among a nation of barbarians one who could repeat\nthe three hundred and eleven poems comprising the Book of Odes from\nbeginning to end, and claim the degree \"Assured Genius\" would ever be\ncertain of a place.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied William Greyson,--\"in the workhouse. Put your degree in\nyour inside pocket, Kong, and don't mention it. You'll have far more\nchance as a distressed mariner. The casual wards are full of B.A.'s,\nbut the navy can't get enough A.B.'s at any price. What do you say to\nan organ, by the way? Mysterious musicians generally go down well, and\nI dare say there's room for a change from veiled ladies, persecuted\ncaptains and indigent earls. You ought to make a sensation.\"\n\n\"Is it in the nature of melodious sounds upon winding a handle?\" I\nasked, not at the moment grasping with certainty to what organ he\nreferred.\n\n\"Well, some call them that,\" he admitted, \"others don't. I suppose, now,\nyou wouldn't care to walk to Brighton with your feet tied together,\nor your hair in curl papers, and then get on at a music hall? Or would\nthere be any chance of your Legation kidnapping you if it was properly\nworked? 'Kong Ho, the great Chinese Reformer, tells the Story of his\nLife,'--there ought to be money in it. Are you a reformer or the leader\nof a secret society, Kong?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I replied, \"we of our Line have ever been unflinching\nin our loyalty to the dynasty of Tsing.\"\n\n\"You ought to have known better, then. It's a poor business being that\nin your country nowadays. Pity there are no bye-elections on the African\nLabour Question, or you'd be snapped up for a procession.\"\n\nTo this I replied that although the idea of moving in a processional\ntriumph would readily ensnare the minds of the light and fantastic, I\nshould prefer some more literary occupation, submissively adding that in\nsuch a case I would not stiffen my joints against the most menial lot,\neven that of blending my voice in a laudatory chorus, or of carrying\nofficial pronouncements about the walls of the city, for it is said with\njustice, \"The starving man does not peel his melon, nor do the parched\nfirst wipe round the edges of the proffered cup.\"\n\n\"If you've set your mind on something literary,\" said Beveledge\nconfidently, \"you have every chance of finishing up in a chorus or\ncarrying printed placards about the streets, certainly. When it comes\nto that, look me up in Eastcheap.\" With this encouraging assurance of\nmy ultimate success he left me, and rejoicing that I had not fallen into\nthe snare of opposing a written destiny, I sought the literary quarters\nof the city.\n\nWhen this person has been able to write of any custom or facet of\nexistence here in a strain of conscientious esteem, he has not hesitated\nto dip his brush deeply into the inkpot. Reverting backwards, this\nbarbarian enactment of not permitting those who from any cause have\ndecided upon spending the night in a philosophical abstraction to repose\nupon the public seats about the swards and open spaces is not conceived\nin a mood of affable toleration. Nevertheless there are deserted places\nbeyond the furthest limits of the city where a more amiable full-face\nis shown. On the eleventh day of this one's determination to sustain\nhimself by the exercise of his literary style, he was journeying about\nsunset towards one of these spots, subduing the grosser instincts of\nmankind by reviewing the wisdom of the sublime Lao Ch'un, who decided\nthat heat and cold, pain and fatigue, and mental distress, have no real\nexistence, and are therefore amenable to logical disproof, while the\ncravings of hunger and thirst are merely the superfluous attributes of\na former and lower state of existence, when a passer-by, who for some\ndistance had been alternately advancing before and remaining behind,\nmatched his footsteps into mine.\n\n\"Whichee way walk-go, John, eh?\" said this unfortunate being, who\nappeared to be suffering from a laborious deformity of speech. \"Allee\nsamee load me. Chin-chin.\"\n\nFilled with compassion for one who evidently found himself alone in a\nstrange land, in the absence of his more highly-accomplished companion,\nunable to indicate his wants and requirements to those about him, I\nregretfully admitted that I had not chanced to encounter that John\nwhose wandering footsteps he sought; and to indicate, by not leaving him\nabruptly, that I maintained a sympathetic concern over his welfare, I\npointed out to him the exceptional brilliance of the approaching night,\nadding that I myself was then directing a course towards a certain\nspacious Heath, a few li distant in the north.\n\n\"Sing-dance tomollow, then?\" he said, with a condensed air of general\ndisappointment. \"Chop-chop in a pay look-see show on Ham--Hamstl--oh\ndamme! on 'Ampstead 'Eath? Booked up, eh, John?\"\n\nGradually convinced that it was becoming necessary to readjust the\nsignificance of the incident, I replied that I had no intention of\npartaking of chops or food of any variety in an erected tent, but merely\nof passing the night in an intellectual seclusion.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the one who was walking by my side, regarding my garments\nwith engaging attention, and at the same time appearing to regain an\nunruffled speech as though the other had been an assumed device, \"I\nunderstand--the Blue Sky Hotel. Well, I've stayed there once or twice\nmyself. A bit down on your uppers, eh?\"\n\n\"Assuredly this person may perchance lay his upper parts down for a\nshort space of time,\" I admitted, when I had traced out the symbolism of\nthe words. \"As it is humanely written in The Books, 'Sleep and suicide\nare the free refuges equally of the innocent and the guilty.'\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, don't,\" exclaimed the energetic person, striking himself\ntogether by means of his two hands. \"It's sinful to talk about suicide\nthe day before bank holiday. Why, my only Somali warrior has vamoosed\nwith his full make-up, and the Magnetic Girl too, and I never thought of\nsuicide--only whether to turn my old woman into a Veiled Beauty of the\nHarem or a Hairy Lama from Tibet.\"\n\nNot absolutely grasping the emergency, yet in a spirit of inoffensive\ncordiality I remarked that the alternative was insufferably perplexing,\nwhile he continued.\n\n\"Then I spotted you, and in a flash I got an idea that ought to take and\nturn out really great if you'll come in. Now follow this: Missionary's\ntent in the wilds of Pekin. Domestic interior by lamp-light. Missionary\n(me) reading evening paper; missionary's wife (the missus) making tea,\nand between times singing to keep the small pet goat quiet (small goat,\na pillow, horsecloth, and pocket-handkerchief). Breaks down singing,\nsobs, and says she feels a strange all-over presentiment. Missionary\nadmits being a bit fluffed himself, and lets out about a notice signed\nin blood that he's seen in the city.\"\n\n\"Carried upon a pole?\" this person demanded, feeling that something of a\nliterary nature might yet be wrested into the incident.\n\n\"On a flagstaff if you like,\" conceded the other one magnanimously. \"A\nnotice to the effect that it is the duty of every jack mother's son of\nthem to douse the foreign devils, man, woman, and child, and especially\nthe talk-book pass-hat-round men. Also that he has had several\nbrick-ends heaved at him on his way back. Then stops suddenly, hits\nhis upper crust, and says that it's like his blamed fat-headedness\nto frighten her; while she clutches at herself three times and faints\naway.\"\n\n\"Amid the voluminous burning of blue lights?\" suggested this person\nresourcefully.\n\n\"By rights there should be,\" admitted the one who was devising the\nrepresentation; \"but it will hardly run to it. Anyway, it costs nothing\nto turn the lamp down--saves a bit in fact, and gives an effect. Then\noutside, in the distance at first you understand, you begin to work up\nthe sound of the advancing mob--rattles, shouts, tum-tums, groans, tin\nplates and all that one mortal man can do with hands, feet and mouth.\"\n\n\"With the interspersal of an occasional cracker and the stirring notes\nproduced by striking a hollow wooden fish repeatedly?\" I cried; for let\nit be confessed that amid the portrayal of the scene my imagination had\ntaken an allotted part.\n\n\"If you like to provide them, and don't set the bally show on fire,\" he\nreplied. \"Anyhow, these two aren't supposed to notice anything even when\nthe row gets louder. Then it drops and you are heard outside talking in\nwhispers to the others--words of command and telling them to keep back\nhalf-a-mo, and so on. See?\"\n\n\"Doubtless introducing a spoken charm and repeating the words of an\nincantation against omens, treachery, and other matters.\"\n\n\"Next a flap of the tent down on the floor is raised, and you\nreconnoitre, looking your very worst and holding a knife between your\nteeth and another in each hand. Wave a hand to your followers to keep\nback--or come on: it makes no difference. Then you crawl in on your\nstomach, give a terrific howl, and stab me in the back. That rolls\nme under the curtain, and so lets me out. The missus ups with the\nwood-chopper and stands before the cradle, while you yell and dance\nround with the knives. That ought to be made 'the moment' of the whole\npiece. The great thing is to make enough noise. If you can yell louder\nthan the talking-machine outfit on the next pitch we ought to turn money\naway. While you are at it I start a fresh row outside--shouts, cheers,\ngroans, words of command and a paper bag or two. Seeing that the game\nis up you make a rush at the old woman; she downs you with the chopper,\nturns the lamp up full, shakes out a Union Jack over the sleeping\ninfant, and finally stands in her finest attitude with one hand pointing\nimpressively upwards and the other contemptuously downwards just as Rule\nBritannia is played on the cornet outside and I appear at the door in a\ngeneral's full uniform and let down the curtain.\"\n\nFor acting in the manner designated--as touching the noises both inside\nand out, the set dance with upraised knives, the casting to earth of\nhimself, and being myself in turn vanquished by the aged female, with\nan added compact that from time to time I should be led by a chain\nand shown to the people from a raised platform--we agreed upon a daily\nreward of two pieces of silver, an adequacy of food, and a certain\nambiguously-referred-to share of the gain. It need not be denied that\nwith so favourable an opportunity of introducing passages from the\nClassics a much less sum would have been accepted, but having obtained\nthis without a struggle, the one now recounting the facts raised the\nopportune suggestion of an inscribed placard, in order to fulfil the\nportent foreshadowed by William Greyson.\n\n\"Oh, we'll star you, never fear,\" assented the accommodating personage,\nand having by this time reached that spot upon the Heath where his\nDomestic Altar had been raised, we entered.\n\n\"All the most distinguished actors in this country take another\nname,\" he said reflectively, when he had drawn forth a parchment of\npraiseworthy dimensions and ink of three colours, \"and though I have\nnothing to say against Kong Ho Tsin Cheng Quank Paik T'chun Li Yuen\nNung for quiet unostentatious dignity, it doesn't have just the grip\nand shudder that we want. Now how does 'Fang' strike you?\" and upon my\ncourteous acquiescence that this indeed united within it those qualities\nwhich he required, he traced its characters in red ink upon a lavish\nscale.\n\n\"'Fang Hung Sin' about fits the idea of snap and bloodthirstiness, I\nshould say,\" he continued, and using the brush and all the colours\nwith an expert proficiency which would infallibly gain him an early\nrecognition at any of our competitive examinations, he presently laid\nbefore me the following gracefully-composed notice, which was suspended\nfrom a conspicuous pole about the door of the tent on the following day.\n\n FANG HUNG SIN\n The Captured Boxer Chieftain.\n\n Under a strong guard, and by arrangement with the British and\n Chinese authorities concerned,\n\n Fang Hung Sin\n\n Will positively re-enact the GORY SCENES of CARNAGE in which\n he took a LEADING and SANGUINARY PART during the LATE RISING.\n\n ALONE IN PEKIN\n Or, What a Woman can do.\n\n PANEL I.

FANG!! FANG!!!\n\nI will not upon this occasion, esteemed one, delay myself with an\naccount of this barbarian Festival of Lanterns; or, as their language\nwould convey it, Feast of Cocoa-nuts, beyond admitting that with\nthe possible exception of an important provincial capital during the\ntriennial examinations I doubt whether our own unapproachable Empire\ncould show a more impressively-extended gathering, either in the diverse\nand ornamental efflorescence of head garb, in the affectionate display\nopenly lavished by persons of one sex towards those of the other, or\neven one more successful in our own pre-eminent art of producing the\nmultitudinous harmony of conflicting sounds.\n\nAt the appointed hour this person submitted himself to be heavily\nshackled, and being led out before the assembled crowd, endeavoured by\na smiling benignity of manner and by reassuring signs of welcome, to\nproduce a favourable impression upon their sympathies and to allure\nthem within. This pacific face was undoubtedly successful, however\noffensively the ill-conditioned one who stood by was inspired to express\nhimself behind his teeth, for the space of the tent was very quickly\noccupied and the actions of simulation were to begin.\n\nWithout doubt it might have been better if this person had first made\nhimself more fully acquainted with the barbarian manner of acting. The\nfact that this imagined play, which even in one of our inferior theatres\nwould have filled the time pleasantly for two or three months, was to\nbe compressed into the narrow limits of seven minutes and a half, should\nreasonably have warned him that amid the ensuing rapidity of word and\naction, most of the leisurely courtesies and all the subtle range of\nconcealed emotion which embellish our own wood pavement must be ignored.\nBut it is well and suggestively written, \"The person who deliberates\nsufficiently before taking every step will spend his life standing\nupon one leg.\" In the past this one had not found himself to be grossly\ninadequate on any arising emergency, and he now drew aside the hanging\ndrapery and prepared to carry out a preconcerted part with intrepid\nself-reliance.\n\nIt has already been expressed, that the reason and incentive urging me\nto a ready agreement lay in the opportunities by which suitable passages\nfrom the high Classics could be discreetly woven into the fabric of the\nplot, and the occupation thereby permeated with an honourable literary\nflavour. In accordance with this resolve I blended together many\nimperishable sayings of the wisest philosophers to present the cries and\nturmoil of the approaching mob, but it was not until I protruded my\nhead beneath the hanging canopy in the guise of one observing that an\nopportunity arose of a really well-sustained effort. In this position I\nrecited Yung Ki's stimulating address to his troops when in sight of an\noverwhelming foe, and, in spite of the continually back-thrust foot\nof the undiscriminating one before me, I successfully accomplished the\nseventy-five lines of the poem without a stumble. Then entering fully,\nwith many deprecatory bows and expressions of self-abasement at taking\npart in so seemingly detestable an action, I treacherously, yet with\ninoffensive tact, struck the one wearing an all-round collar delicately\nupon the back. Not recognising the movement, or being in some other way\nobtuse, the person in question instead of sinking to the ground turned\nhastily to me in the form of an inquiry, leaving me no other reasonable\ncourse than to display the knife openly to him, and to assure him that\nthe fatal blow had already been inflicted. Undoubtedly his immoderate\nretorts were inept at such a moment, nor was his ensuing strategy of\nturning completely round three times, striking himself about the head\nand body, and uttering ceremonious curses before he fell devoid of\nlife--as though the earlier remarks had been part of the ordained\nscheme--to any degree convincing, and the cries of disapproval from the\nonlookers proved that they also regarded this one as the victim of an\nunworthy rebuke.\n\n\"Not if the benches were filled at half a guinea a head would I take\non another performance like that,\" exclaimed the one with whom I was\nassociated, when it was over. \"Besides the dead loss of lasting three\nquarters of an hour it's tempting providence when the seats are movable.\nI suppose it isn't your fault, Kong, you poor creature, but you haven't\ngot no glare and glitter. There's only one thing for it: you must be the\nRev. Mr. Walker and I'll take Fang.\" He then robed himself in my attire,\nguided me among the intricacies of the all-round collar and outer\ngarments in exchange, hung a slender rope about his back, and after\ncompleting the artifice by a skilful device of massing coloured inks\nupon our faces, he commanded me to lead him out by a chain and observe\nintelligently how a captive Boxer chief should disport himself.\n\nNo sooner had we reached the platform than the one whom I controlled\nleapt high into the air, dragged me to the edge of the erection, showed\nhis teeth towards the assembly and waved his arms menacingly at them;\nthen turning upon this person, he inflamed his face with passion,\nrattled his chain furiously, and uttered such vengeance-laden cries\nthat, unable to subdue the emotion of fear, I abandoned all pretence,\nand dropping the chain, fled to the furthest recess of the tent,\nfollowed by the still threatening Fang.\n\nThere is an expression among us, \"Cheng-hu was too considerate: he tried\nto drive nails with a cucumber.\" Cheng-hu would certainly have quickly\nfound the necessity of a weapon of three-times hardened steel if he had\nlived among these barbarians, who are insensible to the higher forms of\npoliteness, in addition to acting in a contrary and illogical manner\non all occasions. Instead of being repelled and discouraged by Fang's\noutrageous behaviour, they clamoured to be admitted into the tent more\nvehemently than before, and so successfully established the venture that\nthe one to whom I must now allude throughout as Fang signified to me his\ncovetous intention of reducing the performance by a further two and a\nhalf minutes in order to reap an added profit and to garner all his rice\nbefore the Hoang Ho rose.\n\nAs for myself, revered, it would be immature to hold the gauze screen of\nprevarication between your all-discerning mind and my own trepidation.\nFrom the moment when I first saw the expression of utterly depraved\nmalignity and deep-seared hate which he had cunningly engraved upon his\nface by means of the coloured inks, I was far from being comfortably\nsettled within myself. Even the society of the not inelegant being of\nthe inner chamber, whom it was now my part to console with alluring\nwords and movements, could not for some time retain my face from a\nback-way instinct at every sound; but when the detail was reached that\nshe sank into my grasp bereft of all energy, and for the first time I\nwas just succeeding in forgetting the unpropitious surroundings, the\none Fang, who had entered with unseemly stealth, suddenly hurled his\nsoul-freezing battle-cry upon my ear and leapt forward with uplifted\nknife. Perceiving the action from an angle of my eye even as he\npropelled himself through the air, I could not restrain an ignoble wail\nof despair, and not scrupling to forsake the maiden, I would have taken\nrefuge beneath a couch had he not seized my outer robe and hurled me\nto the ground. From this point to the close of the entertainment\nthe vigorous person in question did not cease from raising cries and\nchallenges in an unfaltering and many-fathomed stream, while at the same\ntime he continued to spring from one extremity of the stage to the other\nsurrounded by every external attribute of an insatiable tiger-like rage.\nIt is circumstantially related that the one near at hand, who has been\nreferred to as possessing a voiced machine, became demented, and bearing\nthe contrivance to a certain tent erected by the charitable, entreated\nthem to remove the impediment from its speech so that it might be heard\nagain and his livelihood restored. When the action of brandishing\na profusion of knives before the lesser one's eyes was reached, so\nnerve-shattering was the impression which Fang created that the back of\nthe tent had to be removed in order to let out those who no longer had\npossession of themselves, and to let in those--to a ten-fold\ndegree--who strove for admission on the rumour spreading that something\nexceptionally repellent was progressing within.\n\nWith what attenuated organs of repose this person would have reached\nthe end of so strenuous an occupation had he been compelled to twelve\nenactments each hour throughout the gong-strokes of the day without any\nliterary relief, it is not enticing to dwell upon. This evil was averted\nby a timely intervention, for upon proceeding to the outer air for the\nthird time I at once perceived among the foremost throng the engaging\nfull-face of William Beveledge Greyson. This really painstaking\nindividual had learned, as he afterwards explained, that the chiefs of\nexchange (those who in the first case had opposed me resolutely,) had\nreceived a written omen, and now in contrition were expressing their\nwillingness to hold out a full restitution. With this assurance he\nhad set forth in an unremitting search, and guided by street-watchers,\nremovers of superfluous earth, families propelling themselves forward\nupon one foot, astrologers, two-wheeled charioteers, and others who move\nearly and secretly by night, he had traced my description to this same\nHeath. Here he had been attracted by the displayed placard (remembering\nmy honourable boast), and approaching nearer, he had plainly recognised\nmy voice within. But in spite of this the successful disentanglement was\nby no means yet accomplished.\n\nNot expecting so involved a reversal of things, and being short-eyed by\nnature, William Greyson did not wait for a fuller assurance than to\nbe satisfied that the one before him wore my robes and conformed in a\ngeneral outline, before he addressed him.\n\n\"Kong Ho,\" he said pleasantly, \"what the Chief Evil Spirit are you doing\nup there?\" adding persuasively, \"Come down, there's a good fellow. I\nhave something important to tell you.\"\n\nThus appealed to, the one Fang hesitated in doubt, seeing on the one\nhand a certain loss of face if he declined the conversation, and on the\nother hand having no clear perception of what was required from him.\nTherefore he entered upon a course of evasion and somewhat incapably\nreplied, \"Chow Chop Wei Hai Wei Lung Tung Togo Kuroki Jim Jam Beri\nBeri.\"\n\n\"Don't act the horned sheep,\" said Beveledge, who was both resolute and\none easily set into violent motion by an opposing stream. \"Come down,\nor I'll come up and fetch you.\" And not being satisfied with Fang's\nill-advised attempt to express himself equivocally, those around took up\nthe apt similitude of a self-opinionated animal, and began to suggest a\ncomparison to other creatures no less degraded.\n\n\"Rats yourselves!\" exclaimed the easily-inflamed person at my side,\nlosing the inefficient cords of his prudence beneath the sting. \"Who's\na rabbit? For two guinea-pigs I'd mow all the grass between here and\nthe Spaniards with your own left ears,\" and not permitting me sufficient\npreparation to withhold the chain more firmly, he abruptly cast himself\ndown among them, amid a scene of the most untamed confusion.\n\n\"Oh, affectionately-disposed brethren,\" I exclaimed, moving forward and\nraising my hand in refined disapproval, \"the sublime Confucius, in the\ntwenty-third chapter of the book called 'The Great Learning,' warns us\nagainst--\" but before I could formulate the allusion Beveledge\nGreyson, who at the sound of my conciliatory words had gazed first in\nastonishment and then in a self-convulsed position, drew himself up to\nmy side, and taking a firm grasp upon the all-round collar, projected me\nwithout a pause through the tent, and only halting for a moment to point\nsignificantly back to the varied and animated scene behind, where, amid\na very profuse display of contending passions, the erected stage was\nalready being dragged to the ground, and a band of the official watch\nwas in the act of converging from every side, he led me through more\ndeserted paths to the scene of a final extrication.\n\nWith a well-gratified sense of having held an unswerving course along\nthe convoluted outline of Destiny's decree, to whatever tending.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XIV\n\n\n Concerning a pressing invitation from an ever benevolently-\n disposed father to a prosaic but dutifully-inclined son. The\n recording of certain matters of no particular moment.\n Concerning that ultimate end which is symbolic of the\n inexorable wheels of a larger Destiny.\n\n\nVENERATED SIRE,--It is not for the earthworm to say when and in what\nexact position the iron-shod boot shall descend, and this person, being\nan even inferior creature for the purpose of the comparison, bows an\nacquiescent neck to your very explicit command that he shall return to\nYuen-ping without delay. He cannot put away from his mind a clinging\nsuspicion that this arising is the result of some imperfection in\nhis deplorable style of correspondence, whereby you have formed an\nimpression quite opposed to that which it had been the intention to\nconvey, and that, perchance, you even have a secret doubt whether upon\nsome specified occasion he may not have conducted the enterprise to an\nignoble, or at least not markedly successful, end. However, the saying\nruns, \"The stone-cutter always has the last word,\" and you equally, by\nintimating with your usual unanswerable and clear-sighted gift of\nlogic that no further allowance of taels will be sent for this one's\ndispersal, diplomatically impose upon an ever-yearning son the most\nfeverish anxiety once more to behold your large and open-handed face.\n\nStanding thus poised, as it may be said, for a returning flight across\nthe elements of separation, it is not inopportune for this person to let\nhimself dwell gracefully upon those lighter points of recollection which\nhave engraved themselves from time to time upon his mind without leading\nto any more substantial adventure worthy to record. Many of the things\nwhich seemed strange and incomprehensible when he first came among\nthis powerful though admittedly barbarian people, are now revealed at\na proper angle; others, to which he formerly imagined he had found the\ndisclosing key, are, on the other hand, plunged into a distorting haze;\nwhile between these lie a multitude of details in every possible stage\nof disentanglement and doubt. As a final and painstaking pronouncement,\nthis person has no hesitation in declaring that this country is\nnot--as practically all our former travellers have declared--completely\ndown-side-up as compared with our own manners and customs, but at the\nsame time it is very materially sideways.\n\nThus, instead of white, black robes are the indication of mourning; but\nas, for the generality, the same colour is also used for occasions of\ncommerce, ceremony, religion, and the ordinary affairs of life, the\nmatter remains exactly as it was before. Yet with obtuse inconsistency\nthe garments usually white--in which a change would be really\nnoticeable--remain white throughout the most poignant grief. How much\nmore markedly expressed would be the symbolism if during such a period\nthey wore white outer robes and black body garments. Nevertheless it\ncannot be said that they are unmindful of the emblematic influence of\ncolour, for, unlike the reasonable conviction that red is red and blue\nis blue, which has satisfied our great nation from the days of the\nlegendary Shun, these pale-eyed foreigners have diverged into countless\ntrifling imaginings, so that when the one who is now expressing his\ncontempt for the development required a robe of a certain hue, he had to\nbend his mouth, before he could be exactly understood, to the degrading\nnecessity of asking for \"Drowned-rat brown,\" \"Sunstroke magenta,\"\n\"Billingsgate purple,\" \"London milk azure,\" \"Settling-day green,\" or the\nlike. In the other signs of mourning they do not come within measurable\ndistance of our pure and uncomfortable standard. \"If you are really\nsincere in your regret for the one who has Passed Beyond, why do you not\nsit upon the floor for seven days and nights, take up all food with your\nfingers, and allow your nails to grow untrimmed for three years?\" was\na question which I at first instinctively put to lesser ones in their\naffliction. In every case save one I received answers of evasive\npurport, and even the one stated reason, \"Because although I am a poor\nwidder I ain't a pig,\" I deemed shallow.\n\nI have already dipped a revealing brush into the subject of names.\nWere the practice of applying names in a wrong and illogical sequence\nmaintained throughout it might indeed raise a dignified smile, but\nit would not appear contemptible; but what can be urged when upon an\noccasion one name appears first, upon another occasion last? A dignity\nis conferred in old age, and it is placed before the family designation\nborne by an honoured father and a direct line of seventeen revered\nancestors. Another title is bestowed, and eats up the former like a\nrevengeful dragon. New distinctions follow, some at one end, others at\nanother, until a very successful person may be suitably compared to\nthe ringed oleander snake, which has the power of growing equally\nfrom either the head or the tail. To express the matter by a definite\nallusion, how much more graceful and orchideous, even in a condensed\nfashion, would appear the designation of this selected one, if instead\nof the usual form of the country it was habitually set forth in the\nfollowing logical and thoroughly Chinese style:--Chamberlain Joseph,\nMaster, Mr., Thrice Wearer of the Robes and Golden Collar, One of the\nJust Peacemakers, Esquire, Member of the House of Law-givers, Leader\nin the Council of Commerce, Presider over the Tables of Provincial\nGovernment, Uprightly Honourable Secretary of the Outlying Parts.\n\nAmong the notes which at various times I have inscribed in a book\nfor future guidance I find it written on an early page, \"They do not\nhesitate to express their fathers' names openly,\" but to this assertion\nthere stands a warning sign which was added after the following\nincident. \"Is it true, Mr. Kong,\" asked a lesser one, who is spoken of\nas vastly rich but discontented with her previous lot, of this person\nupon an occasion, \"is it really true that your countrymen to not\nconsider it right to speak of their fathers' names, even in this\nenlightened age?\" To this I replied that the matter was as she had\neloquently expressed it, and, encouraged by her amiable condescension,\nI asked after the memory of her paternal grandsire, whose name I had\nfrequently heard whispered in connection with her own. To my inelegant\nconfusion she regarded me for a period as though I had the virtue of\nhaving become transparent, and then passed on in a most overwhelming\nexcess of disconcertingly-arranged silence.\n\n\"You've done it now, Kong,\" said one who stood by (or, as we would\nexpress the same thought, \"You have succeeded in accomplishing the\nundesirable\"); \"don't you know that the old man was in the tripe and\ntrotter line?\"\n\n\"To no degree,\" I replied truly. \"Yet,\" I continued, matching his idiom\nwith another equally facile, \"wherein was this person's screw loose? Are\nthey not openly referred to--those of the Line of Tripe and Trotter--by\ntheir descendants?\"\n\n\"Not in most cases,\" he said, with a concentration that indicated\na lurking sting among his words. \"Generally speaking, they aren't\nmentioned or taken into any account whatever. While they are alive they\nare kept in the background and invited to treat themselves to the Tower\nwhen nice people are expected; when dead they are fastened up in the\nfamily back cupboard by a score of ten-inch nails and three-trick Yale\nlocks, so to speak. And in the meantime all the splash is being made on\ntheir muddy oof. See?\"\n\nI nodded agreeably, though, had the opportunity been more favourable, I\nwould have made the feint to learn somewhat more of this secret practice\nof burying in the enclosed space beneath the stairs. Thus is it set\nforth why, after the statement, \"They do not hesitate to express their\nfathers' names openly,\" it is further written, \"Walk slowly! Engrave\nwell upon your discreet remembrance the unmentionable Line of Tripe and\nTrotter.\"\n\nAnother point of comparison which the superficial have failed to record\nis to be found in the frequent encouragements to regard The Virtues\nwhich are to be seen, like our own Confucian extracts, freely inscribed\non every wall and suitable place about the city. These for the most part\ncounsel moderation in taking false oaths, in stepping heedlessly upon\nthe unknown ground, in following paths which lead to doubtful ends, and\nother timely warnings. \"Beware a smoke-breathing demon,\" is frequently\ncast across one's path upon a barrier, and this person has never failed\nto accept the omen and to retrace his steps hastily without looking to\nthe right or the left. Even our own national caution is not forgotten,\nalthough to conform to barbarian indolence it is written, \"Slowly,\nslowly; drive slowly.\" \"Keep to the Right\" (or, \"Abandon that which is\nevil,\" as the analogy holds,) is perhaps the most frequently displayed\nof all, and doubtless many charitable persons obtain an ever-accruing\nmerit by hanging the sign bearing these words upon every available post.\nOthers are of a stern and threatening nature, designed to make the most\nhardened ill-doer pause, as--in their own tongue--\"Rubbish may be shot\nhere\"; which we should render, \"At any moment, and in such a place\nas this, a just doom and extinction may overtake the worthless.\" This\ninscription is never to be seen except in waste expanses, where it\npoints its significance with a multiplied force. There is another\ndefinite threat which is lavishly set out, and so thoroughly that it may\nbe encountered in the least frequented and almost inaccessible spots.\nThis, as it may be translated, reads, \"Trespass not the forbidden. The\nprofligate may flourish like the gourd for a season, but in the\nend assuredly they will be detected, and justice meted out with the\nrelentless fury of the written law.\"\n\nIn a converse position, the wide difference in the ceremonial forms of\nretaliatory invective has practically disarmed this usually eloquent\nperson, and he long since abandoned every hope of expressing himself\nwith any satisfaction in encounters of however acrimonious a trend.\nAt first, with an urbane smile and gestures of dignified contempt, he\nimpugned the authenticity of the Ancestral Tablets of those with whom\nhe strove, in an unbroken stream of most bitter contumely. Finding them\nsilent under this reproach, he next lightly traced their origin back\nthrough generations of afflicted lepers, deformed ape-beings, and\nNameless Things, to a race of primitive ghouls, and then went on in\nrelentless fluency to predict an early return in their descendants to\nthe condition of a similar state. For some time he had a well-gratified\nassurance that those whom he assailed were so overwhelmed as to be\nincapable of retort, and in this belief he never failed to call upon\npassers-by to witness his triumph; but on the fourth occasion a young\nman whom I had thus publicly denounced for a sufficient though forgotten\nreason, after listening courteously to my venomous accusations, bestowed\na two-cash piece upon me and passed on, remarking that it was hard,\nand those around, also, would have added from their stores had it\nbeen permitted. From this time onward I did not attempt to make myself\ndisagreeable either in public or to those whom I esteemed privately. On\nthe other hand, the barbarian manner of retort did not find me endowed\nby nature to parry it successfully. Quite lacking in measured periods,\nit aims, by an extreme rapidity of thrust and an insincerity of\nsequence, to entangle the one who is assailed in a complication of\narising doubts and emotions. \"Who are you,--no one but yourself,\"\nexclaimed a hireling of hung-dog expression who claimed to have\nexchanged pledging gifts with a certain maiden who stood, as it were,\nbetween us, and falling into the snare, I protested warmly against the\ninsult, and strove to disprove the inference before the paralogism lay\nrevealed. Throughout the whole range of the Odes, the Histories, the\nAnalects, and the Rites what recognised formula of rejoinder is there to\nthe taunt, \"Oh, go and put your feet in mustard and cress\"; or how\ncan one, however skilled in the highest Classics, parry the subtle\ninconsistencies of the reproach, \"You're a nice bit of orl right, aren't\nyou? Not arf, I don't think.\"\n\nAmong the arts of this country that of painting upon canvas is held in\nrepute, but to a person associated with the masterpieces of the Ma epoch\nthese native attempts would be gravity-dispelling if they were not too\nreminiscent of the torture chamber. It is rarely, indeed, that even the\nmost highly-esteemed picture-makers succeed in depicting every portion\nof a human body submitted to their brush, and not infrequently half\nof the face is left out. Once, when asked by a paint-applier who was\nentitled to append two signs of exceptional distinction behind his name,\nto express an opinion upon a finished work, I diffidently called his\nattention to the fact that he had forgotten to introduce a certain\nexalted one's left ear. \"Not at all, Mr. Kong,\" he replied, with an\nexpression of ill-merited self-satisfaction, \"but it is hidden by the\nface.\" \"Yet it exists,\" I contended; \"why not, therefore, press it to\nthe front at all hazard, rather than send so great a statesman down\ninto the annals of posterity as deformed to that extent?\" \"It certainly\nexists,\" he admitted, \"and one takes that for granted; but in my picture\nit cannot be seen.\" I bowed complaisantly, content to let so damaging\nan admission point its own despair. A moment later I continued, \"In the\ngreat Circular Hall of the Palace of Envoys there is a picture of\ntwo camels, foot-tethered, as it fortunately chanced, to iron rings.\nFormerly there were a drove of eight--the others being free--so\nexquisitely outlined in all their parts that one night, when the door\nhad been left incautiously open, they stepped down from the wall and\nescaped to the woods. How deplorable would have been the plight of these\nunfortunate beings, if upon passing into the state of a living existence\nthey had found that as a result of the limited vision of their creator\nthey only possessed twelve legs and three whole bodies among them.\"\n\nPerchance this tactfully-related story, so applicable to his own\ndeficiencies, may sink into the imagination of the one for whom it was\ninoffensively unfolded. Yet doubt remains. Our own picture-judgers\ntake up a position at the side of work when they with to examine its\nqualities, retiring to an ever-diminishing angle in order to bring out\nthe more delicate effects, until a very expert and conscientious critic\nwill not infrequently stand really behind the picture he is considering\nbefore he delivers a final pronouncement. Not until these native artists\nare able to regard their crude attempts from the other side of the\ncanvas can they hope to become equally proficient. To this fatal\nshortcoming must be added that of insatiable ambition, which prompts\nthe young to the portrayal of widely differing subjects. Into the\npicture-room of one who might thus be described this person was recently\nconducted, to pass an opinion upon a scene in which were depicted\nseven men of varying nationalities and appropriately garbed, one of the\nopposing sex carrying a lighted torch, an elephant reclining beneath a\nfruitful vine, and the President of a Republic. For a period this person\nresisted the efforts of those who would have questioned him, withdrawing\ntheir attention to the harmonious lights upon the river mist floating\nfar below, but presently, being definitely called upon, he replied as\nfollows: \"Mih Ying, who was perhaps the greatest of his time, spent his\nwhole life in painting green and yellow beetles in the act of concealing\nthemselves beneath dead maple leaves upon the approach of day. At the\nage of seventy-five he burst into tears, and upon being approached for\na cause he exclaimed, 'Alas, if only this person had resisted the\ntemptation to be diffuse, and had confined himself to green beetles\nalone, he might now, instead of contemplating a misspent career, have\nbeen really great.' How much less,\" I continued, \"can a person of\nimmature moustaches hope to depict two such conflicting objects as a\nrecumbent elephant and the President of a Republic standing beneath a\nbanner?\"\n\nUpon the temptation to deal critically with the religious instincts of\nthe islanders this person draws an obliterating brush. As practically\nevery traveller who has honoured our unattractive land with his\neffusive presence has subsequently left it in a printed record that\nour ceremonies are grotesque, our priesthood ignorant and depraved,\nour monasteries and sacred places spots of plague upon an otherwise\nflower-adorned landscape, and our beliefs and sacrifices only worthy to\nexist for the purpose of being made into jest-origins by more refined\ncommunities, the omission on this one's part may appear uncivil and\nperhaps even intentionally discourteous. To this, as a burner of\njoss-sticks and an irregular person, he can only reply by a deprecatory\nwaving of both hands and a reassuring smile.\n\nWith the two-sided memories of many other details hanging thickly around\nhis brush, it would not be an achievement to continue to a practically\ninexhaustible amount. As of the set days when certain things are\nobserved, among which fall the first of the fourth month (but that would\ndisclose another involvement), another when flat cakes are partaken\nof without due caution, another when rounder cakes are even more\nincautiously consumed, and that most brightly-illuminated of all when it\nis permissible to embrace maidens openly, and if discreetly accomplished\nwith no overhanging fear of ensuing forms of law, beneath the emblem of\na suspended branch, in memory of the wisdom of certain venerable sages\nwho were doubtless expert in the practice. As of the inconvenient\ncustom when two persons are walking together that they should arrange\nthemselves side by side, to the obvious discomfort of others, the\nsweeping away of all opportunities for agreeable politeness, and\nthe utter disregard of the time-honoured example of the sagacious\nwater-fowl. As of the inconsistency of refusing, even with contempt, to\nreceive our most intimate form of regard and use this person's lip-cloth\nafter a feast, yet the mulish eagerness in that same youth to drink from\na cup previously used by a lesser one. As of the precision (which still\nremains a cloud of doubt,) with which creatures so intractable as the\nbull are successfully trained to roar aloud at certain gong-strokes of\nthe day as an agreed signal. As of the streets in movement, the lights\nat evening, and the voices of those unseen. As of these and as of other\nmatters, so multitudinous that they crowd about this person's mind\nlike the assembling swallows, circling above the deserted millet\nfields before they turn their beaks to the sea, and dropping his brush\n(perchance with an acquiescent sigh), he, also, kow-tows submissively\nto a blind but appointed destiny, and prepares to seek a passage from an\nalien land of sojourning.\n\nWith the impetuous craving of an affectionate son to behold a revered\nsire, intensified by the fact that he has reached the innermost lining\nof his sleeve; with affectionate greetings towards Ning, Hia-Fa, and\nT'ian Yen, and an assurance that they have never been really absent from\nhis thoughts.\n\nKONG HO.\n\n\n Ernest Bramah, of whom in his lifetime Who's Who had so\n little to say, was born in Manchester. At seventeen he chose\n farming as a profession, but after three years of losing\n money gave it up to go into journalism. He started as\n correspondent on a typical provincial paper, then went to\n London as secretary to Jerome K. Jerome, and worked himself\n into the editorial side of Jerome's magazine, To-day, where\n he got the opportunity of meeting the most important\n literary figures of the day. But he soon left To-day to\n join a new publishing firm, as editor of a publication\n called The Minister; finally, after two years of this, he\n turned to writing as his full-time occupation. He was\n intensely interested in coins and published a book on the\n English regal copper coinage. He is, however, best known as\n the creator of the charming character Kai Lung who appears\n in Kai Lung Unrolls His Mat, Kai Lung's Golden Hours, The\n Wallet of Kai Lung, Kai Lung Beneath the Mulberry Tree, The\n Mirror of Kong Ho, and The Moon of Much Gladness; he also\n wrote two one-act plays which are often performed at London\n variety theatres, and many stories and articles in leading\n periodicals. He died in 1942.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Mirror of Kong Ho, by Ernest Bramah\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MIRROR OF KONG HO ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1077.txt or 1077.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/7/1077/\n\nProduced by John Bickers\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
