{"content": "      \u201cBe the change that you wish to see in the world.\u201d\n      \u201cLive as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.\u201d\n      \u201cAn eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.\u201d\n      \u201cHappiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.\u201d\n      \u201cWhen I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.\u201d\n      \u201cWhere there is love there is life.\u201d\n      \u201cI like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.\u201d\n      \u201cPrayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is daily admission of one's weakness. It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart.\u201d\n      \u201cFreedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.\u201d\n      \u201cNobody can hurt me without my permission.\u201d\n      \u201cGod has no religion.\u201d\n      \u201cHate the sin, love the sinner.\u201d\n      \u201cI will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.\u201d\n      \u201cYou must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.\u201d\n      \u201cThe best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\u201d\n      \u201cLet the first act of every morning be to make the following resolve for the day:- I shall not fear anyone on Earth. - I shall fear only God. - I shall not bear ill will toward anyone. - I shall not submit to injustice from anyone. - I shall conquer untruth by truth. And in resisting untruth, I shall put up with all suffering.\u201d\n      \u201cThe future depends on what you do today.\u201d\n      \u201cA man is but the product of his thoughts. What he thinks, he becomes.\u201d\n      \u201cTo give pleasure to a single heart by a single act is better than a thousand heads bowing in prayer.\u201d\n      \u201cMan often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.\u201d\n      \u201cThe greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.\u201d\n      \u201cEach night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn.\u201d\n      \u201cEarth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed.\u201d\n      \u201cWhat difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or in the holy name of liberty or democracy?\u201d\n      \u201cTo believe in something, and not to live it, is dishonest.\u201d\n      \u201cThere are people in the world so hungry, that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is unwise to be too sure of one's own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.\u201d\n      \u201cWhatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.\u201d\n      \u201cThe day the power of love overrules the love of power, the world will know peace.\u201d\n      \u201cTruth never damages a cause that is just.\u201d\n      \u201cWhenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love.\u201d\n      \u201cStrength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is easy enough to be friendly to one's friends. But to befriend the one who regards himself as your enemy is the quintessence of true religion. The other is mere business.\u201d\n      \u201cAction expresses priorities.\u201d\n      \u201cTo call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to woman. If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably man's superior. Has she not greater intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not greater powers of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without her, man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our being, the future is with woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to the heart than woman?\"[To the Women of India (Young India, Oct. 4, 1930)]\u201d\n      \u201cMy Life is My Message\u201d\n      \u201cYou don't know who is important to you until you actually lose them.\u201d\n      \u201cIt's the action, not the fruit of the action, that's important. You have to do the right thing. It may not be in your power, may not be in your time, that there'll be any fruit. But that doesn't mean you stop doing the right thing. You may never know what results come from your action. But if you do nothing, there will be no result.\u201d\n      \u201cYou can chain me, you can torture me, you can even destroy this body, but you will never imprison my mind.\u201d\n      \u201cYou may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no results.\u201d\n      \u201cIf I had no sense of humor, I would long ago have committed suicide.\u201d\n      \u201cThere is more to life than simply increasing its speed.\u201d\n      \u201cI offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.\u201d\n      \u201cLove is the strongest force the world possesses and yet it is the humblest imaginable.\u201d\n      \u201cThe simplest acts of kindness are by far more powerful then a thousand heads bowing in prayer.\u201d\n      \u201cThere is nothing that wastes the body like worry, and one who has any faith in God should be ashamed to worry about anything whatsoever. \u201d\n      \u201cThey cannot take away our self respect if we do not give it to them.\u201d\n      \u201cSilence becomes cowardice when occasion demands speaking out the whole truth and acting accordingly.\u201d\n      \u201cA coward is incapable of exhibiting love; it is the prerogative of the brave.\u201d\n      \u201cIn a gentle way, you can shake the world.\u201d\n      \u201cTo my mind, the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being.\u201d\n      \u201cIn doing something, do it with love or never do it at all.\u201d\n      \u201cSpeak only if it improves upon the silence.\u201d\n      \u201cI call him religious who understands the suffering of others.\u201d\n      \u201cThere is no 'way to peace,' there is only 'peace.\u201d\n      \u201cPoverty is the worst form of violence.\u201d\n      \u201cTruth is one, paths are many.\u201d\n      \u201cAlways aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed. Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well.\u201d\n      \u201cI believe in the fundamental truth of all great religions of the world.\u201d\n      \u201cYes I am, I am also a Muslim, a Christian, a Buddhist, and a Jew.\u201d\n      \u201cPower is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent than the one derived from fear of punishment.\u201d\n      \u201cMy imperfections and failures are as much a blessing from God as my successes and my talents and I lay them both at his feet.\u201d\n      \u201cI came to the conclusion long ago that all religions were true and that also that all had some error in them, and while I hold by my own religion, I should hold other religions as dear as Hinduism. So we can only pray, if we were Hindus, not that a Christian should become a Hindu; but our innermost prayer should be that a Hindu should become a better Hindu, a Muslim a better Muslim, and a Christian a better Christian.\u201d\n      \u201cFaith is not something to grasp, it is a state to grow into.\u201d\n      \u201cI believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers.\u201d\n      \u201cPalestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home\u201d\n      \u201cEach one has to find his peace from within. And peace to be real must be unaffected by outside circumstances.\u201d\n      \u201cA 'No' uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a 'Yes' merely uttered to please, or worse, to avoid trouble.\u201d\n      \u201cThere are many causes I would die for. There is not a single cause I would kill for.\u201d\n      \u201cOur ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and the test of our civilisation.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is wrong and immoral to seek to escape the consequences of one's acts.\u201d\n      \u201cIf we are to reach real peace in the world, we shall have to begin with the children.\u201d\n      \u201c(When asked what he thought of Western civilization): 'I think it would be a good idea.\u201d\n      \u201cPrayer is not an old woman's idle amusement. Properly understood and applied, it is the most potent instrument of action.\u201d\n      \u201cNothing is so aggravating as calmness.\u201d\n      \u201cLive simply so that others may simply live.\u201d\n      \u201cManliness consists not in bluff, bravado or loneliness. It consists in daring to do the right thing and facing consequences whether it is in matters social, political or other. It consists in deeds not words.\u201d\n      \u201cThe world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed.\u201d\n      \u201cThe greatness of humanity is not in being human, but in being humane.\u201d\n      \u201cThere is no such thing as \u2018too insane\u2019 unless others turn up dead due to your actions.\u201d\n      \u201cFearlessness is the first requisite of spirituality. Cowards can never be moral.\u201d\n      \u201cThere is force in the universe, which, if we permit it, will flow through us and produce miraculous results.\u201d\n      \u201cOf all the evils for which man has made himself responsible, none is so degrading, so shocking or so brutal as his abuse of the better half of humanity; the female sex.\u201d\n      \u201cThe difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world's problems.\u201d\n      \u201cI cannot teach you violence, as I do not myself believe in it. I can only teach you not to bow your heads before any one even at the cost of your life.\u201d\n      \u201cThey may torture my body, break my bones, even kill me. Then they will have my dead body, but not my obedience.\u201d\n      \u201cEthically they had arrived at the conclusion that man's supremacy over lower animals meant not that the former should prey upon the latter, but that the higher should protect the lower, and that there should be mutual aid between the two as between man and man. They had also brought out the truth that man eats not for enjoyment but to live.\u201d\n      \u201cThe inner voice is something which cannot be described in words. But sometimes we have a positive feeling that something in us prompts us to do a certain thing. The time when I learnt to recognise this voice was, I may say, the time when I started praying regularly.\u201d\n      \u201cThe path is the goal.\u201d\n      \u201cLiberty and democracy become unholy when their hands are dyed red with innocent blood.\u201d\n      \u201cIn a gentle way you can shake the world.\u201d\n      \u201cNothing has saddened me so much in life as the hardness of heart of educated people.\u201d\n      \u201cHonest differences are often a healthy sign of progress.\u201d\n      \u201cit's easy to stand in the crowd but it takes courage to stand alone\u201d\n      \u201cIf I were asked to define the Hindu creed, I should simply say: Search after truth through non-violent means. A man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu. Hinduism is a relentless pursuit after truth... Hinduism is the religion of truth. Truth is God. Denial of God we have known. Denial of truth we have not known.\u201d\n      \u201cSatisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment. Full effort is full victory.\u201d\n      \u201cThe only difference between man and man all the world over is one of degree, and not of kind, even as there is between trees of the same species.Where in is the cause for anger, envy or discrimination?\u201d\n      \u201cIf I were a dictator, religion and state would be separate. I swear by my religion. I will die for it. But it is my personal affair. The state has nothing to do with it. The state would look after your secular welfare, health, communications, foreign relations, currency and so on, but not your or my religion. That is everybody's personal concern!\u201d\n      \u201cTrue beauty lies in purity of the heart.\u201d\n      \u201cOn the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's 70th birthday. \"Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked upon this Earth.\u201d\n      \u201cLove never claims, it ever gives. Love ever suffers, never resents never revenges itself.\u201d\n      \u201cYou cannot shake hands with a clenched fist.\u201d\n      \u201cNon-violence, which is the quality of the heart, cannot come by an appeal to the brain.\u201d\n      \u201cThe moment there is suspicion about a person's motives, everything he does becomes tainted.\u201d\n      \u201cI become more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of Hussein, the scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers and his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle.\u201d\n      \u201cAs human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world - that is the myth of the atomic age - as in being able to remake ourselves.\u201d\n      \u201cMany people, especially ignorant people, want to punish you for speaking the truth, for being correct, for being you. Never apologize for being correct, or for being years ahead of your time. If you\u2019re right and you know it, speak your mind. Speak your mind. Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is still the truth.\u201d\n      \u201cWherever you are you will always be in my heart.\u201d\n      \u201cI should love to satisfy all, if I possibly can; but in trying to satisfy all, I may be able to satisfy none. I have, therefore, arrived at the conclusion that the best course is to satisfy one\u2019s own conscience and leave the world to form its own judgment, favorable or otherwise.\u201d\n      \u201cIf I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.\u201d\n      \u201cI am but a poor struggling soul yearning to be wholly good, wholly truthful and wholly non-violent in thought, word and deed, but ever failing to reach the ideal which I know to be true. It is a painful climb, but each step upwards makes me feel stronger and fit for the next. \u201d\n      \u201cChampions are made from something they have deep inside of them-a desire, a dream, a vison.\u201d\n      \u201cTruth resides in every human heart,and one has to search for it there,and to be guided by truth as one sees it.But no one has a right to coerce othersto act according to his own view of truth.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is good to see ourselves as others see us. Try as we may, we are neverable to know ourselves fully as we are, especially the evil side of us. This we can do only if we are not angry with our critics but will take in good heart whatever they might have to say.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is not that I do not get angry. I don't give vent to my anger. I cultivate the quality of patience as angerlessness, and generally speaking, I succeed. But I only control my anger when it comes. How I find it possible to control it would be a useless question, for it is a habit that everyone must cultivate and must succeed in forming by constant practice.\u201d\n      \u201cTrue morality consists not in following the beaten track, but in finding the true path for ourselves, and fearlessly following it.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.\u201d\n      \u201cI have learnt through bitter experience the one supreme lesson to conserve my anger, and as heat conserved is transmuted into energy, even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power which can move the world.\u201d\n      \u201cPrayer is the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening.\u201d\n      \u201cEvery worthwhile accomplishment, big or little, has its stages of drudgery and triumph: a beginning, a struggle, and a victory.\u201d\n      \u201cWhere there is life, there is love.\u201d\n      \u201cWhere love is, there God is also.\u201d\n      \u201cIf you don't find God in the next person you meet, it is a waste of time looking for him further.\u201d\n      \u201cYou yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve love and affection.\u201d\n      \u201cSatisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment.\u201d\n      \u201cService which is rendered without joy helps neither the servant nor the served.

All the tendencies present in the outer world are to be found in the world of our body. If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. This is the divine mystery supreme. A wonderful thing it is and the source of our happiness. We need not wait to see what others do.\u201d\n      \u201cAn unjust law is itself a species of violence. Arrest for its breach is more so.\u201d\n      \u201cI can not give you the reference of Ram Chandar or Krishna, because they were not historical figures.

But you treat it as though it is nothing more than a piece of literature.\u201d\n      \u201cCowardice is impotence worse than violence. The coward desires revenge but being afraid to die, he looks to others, maybe to the government of the day, to do the work of defense for him. A coward is less than a man. He does not deserve to be a member of a society of men and women.\u201d\n      \u201cThe more efficient a force is, the more silent and the more subtle it is.\u201d\n      \u201cA lot of people are waiting for Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi to come back-but they are gone. We are it. It is up to us. It is up to you.\u201d\n      \u201cWhere there is fear there is no religion.\u201d\n      \u201cThere are only two ways to live your life: as though nothing is a miracle, or as though everything is a miracle.\u201d\n      \u201cBirth and death are not two different states, but they are different aspects of the same state.\u201d\n      \u201cA language is an exact reflection of the character and growth of its speakers.\u201d\n      \u201cIf you want something really important to be done you must not merely satisfy the reason, you must move the heart also.\u201d\n      \u201cYou can't lead a true life without suffering\u201d\n      \u201cI can retain neither respect nor affection for government which has been moving from wrong to wrong in order to defend its immorality\u201d\n      \u201cAmong the many misdeeds of British rule in India, history will look upon the Act which deprived a whole nation of arms as the blackest.\u201d\n      \u201cMany social justice or social activist movements have been rooted in a position. A position is usually against something. Any position will call up its opposition. If I say up, it generates down. If I say right, it really creates left. If I say good, it creates bad. So a position creates its opposition. A stand is something quite distinct from that. There are synonyms for \u201cstand\u201d such as \u201cdeclaration\u201d or \u201ccommitment,\u201d but let me talk for just a few moments about the power of a stand. A stand comes from the heart, from the soul. A stand is always life affirming. A stand is always trustworthy. A stand is natural to who you are. When we use the phrase \u201ctake a stand\u201d I\u2019m really inviting you to un-cover, or \u201cunconceal,\u201d or recognize, or affirm, or claim the stand that you already are. Stand-takers are the people who actually change the course of history and are the source of causing an idea\u2019s time to come. Mahatma Gandhi was a stand-taker. He took a stand so powerful that it mobilized millions of people in a way that the completely unpredictable outcome of the British walking out of India did happen. And India became an independent nation. The stand that he took\u2026 or the stand that Martin Luther King, Jr. took or the stand that Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony took for women\u2019s rights\u2014those stands changed our lives today. The changes that have taken place in history as a result of the stand-takers are permanent changes, not temporary changes. The women in this room vote because those women took so powerful a stand that it moved the world. And so the opportunity here is for us to claim the stand that we already are, not take a position against the macro economic system, or a position against this administration, although some of you may have those feelings. What\u2019s way more powerful than that is taking a stand, which includes all positions, which allows all positions to be heard and reconsidered, and to begin to dissolve.When you take a stand, it actually does shift the whole universe and unexpected, unpredictable things happen.\u201d\n      \u201cI have also seen children successfully surmounting the effects of an evil inheritance. That is due to purity being an inherent attribute of the soul.\u201d\n      \u201cAs long as you derive inner help and comfort from anything, keep it.\u201d\n      \u201cVaccination is a barbarous practice and one of the most fatal of all the delusions current in our time.Conscientious objectors to vaccination should stand alone, if need be, against the whole world, in defense of their conviction.\u201d\n      \u201cI offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings. My wisdom flows from the Highest Source. I salute that Source in you. Let us work together for unity and love.\u201d\n      \u201cThere's no God higher than truth.\u201d\n      \u201cI have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts. A thoughtless word hardly ever escaped my tongue or pen. Experience has taught me that silence is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. We find so many people impatient to talk. All this talking can hardly be said to be of any benefit to the world. It is so much waste of time. My shyness has been in reality my shield and buckler. It has allowed me to grow. It has helped me in my discernment of truth.\u201d\n      \u201cNo culture can live, if it attempts to be exclusive.\u201d\n      \u201cLove is the strongest force the world possesses.\u201d\n      \u201cOne needs to be slow to form convictions, but once formed they must be defended against the heaviest odds.\u201d\n      \u201cIntellect takes us along in the battle of life to a certain limit, but at the crucial moment it fails us. Faith transcends reason. It is when the horizon is the darkest and human reason is beaten down to the ground that faith shines brightest and comes to our rescue.\u201d\n      \u201cJoy lies in the fight, in the attempt, in the suffering involved, not in the victory itself\u201d\n      \u201cGod, help me to tell the thruth to the strong and to avoid telling lies to get the weak's applause. If you give me success, do not take away my humility. If you give me humility, do not take away my dignity. God, help me to see the other side of the medal. Don't let me blame others of treason just because they don't think they like me. God, teach me to love people as I love myself and to judge me as I judge others. Please, don't let me be proud if I succed, or fall in despair if I fall. Remind me that failure is the experience that precedes triumph. Teach me that forgiving is the most important in the strong and that revenge is the most primitive sigh in the weak. If you take away my success, let me keep my strength to succeed from failure. If I fall people, give me courage to apologize and if people fail me, give me courage to forgive them. God, if I forget you, please do not forget me.\u201d\n      \u201cNon-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man.\u201d\n      \u201cAnger and intolerance are the twin enemies of correct understanding.\u201d\n      \u201cI shall die, but I will not kill.\u201d\n      \u201cStrength of numbers is the delight of the timid. The Valiant in spirit glory in fighting alone.\u201d\n      \u201cStoning prophets and erecting churches to their memory afterwards has been the way of the world through the ages. Today we worship Christ, but the Christ in the flesh we crucified.\u201d\n      \u201cIn prayer it is better to have a heart without words than words without a heart.\u201d\n      \u201cI believe in trusting. Trust begets trust. Suspicion is foetid and only stinks. He who trusts has never yet lost in the world.\u201d\n      \u201cMahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King are great examples of fantastic nonviolents who died violently. I can never work that out. We're pacifists, but I'm not sure what it means when you're such a pacifist that you get shot. I can never understand that.\u201d\n      \u201cA man who is truthful and does not mean ill even to his adversary will be slow to believe charges even against his foes. He will, however, try to understand the viewpoints of his opponents and will always keep an open mind and seek every opportunity of serving his opponents.\u201d\n      \u201cI am prepared to die, but there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill.\u201d\n      \u201cJust as a man would not cherish living in a body other than his own, so do nations not like to live under other nations, however noble and great the latter may be.\u201d\n      \u201cSympathy is what you have for someone after they die, pity you have for someone when they don't have a date to the biggest dance of the year. Empathy is what I do to you when you judge me. Envy is having pity on yourself. Can you discern the rest for yourself?\u201d\n      \u201cGovernment control gives rise to fraud, suppression of Truth, intensification of the black market and artificial scarcity. Above all, it unmans the people and deprives them of initiative, it undoes the teaching of self-help\u2026\u201d\n      \u201cI look upon an increase in the power of the State with the greatest fear because, although while apparently doing good by minimizing exploitation, it does the greatest harm to mankind by destroying individuality which lies at the heart of all progress.\u201d\n      \u201cSolitude is a catalyst for innovation\u201d\n      \u201cInterdependence is and ought to be as much the ideal of man as self-sufficiency. Man is a social being. Without interrelation with society he cannot realize his oneness with the universe or suppress his egotism. His social interdependence enables him to test his faith and to prove himself on the touchstone of reality.\u201d\n      \u201cAll humanity is one undivided and indivisible family. I cannot detach myself from the wickedest soul.\u201d\n      \u201cWe stand on the threshold of a twilight-whether morning or evening we do not know. One is followed by the night, the other heralds the dawn.\u201d\n      \u201cTruth is like a vast tree which yields more and more fruit the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mind of truth, the richer the discovery of the gems buried there.\u201d\n      \u201cWhen I admire the wonders of a sunset or the beauty of the moon, my soul expands in the worship of the creator.\u201d\n      \u201cI do not believe in the doctrine of the greatest good of the greatest number. The only real, dignified, human doctrine is the greatest good of all.\u201d\n      \u201cThe devotion of such titans of spirit as Lenin to an Ideal must bear fruit. The nobility of his selflessness will be an example through centuries to come, and his Ideal will reach perfection.\u201d\n      \u201cThat service is the noblest which is rendered for its own sake.\u201d\n      \u201cIntolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.\u201d\n      \u201cWe should be able to refuse to live if the price of living be the torture of sentient beings.\u201d\n      \u201cAll true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness.\u201d\n      \u201cThose who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is.\u201d\n      \u201cEven the most despotic government cannot stand except for the consent of the governed.... Immediately the subject ceases to fear the despotic force, his power is gone.\u201d\n      \u201cMy aim is not to be consistent with my previous statements on a given question, but to be consistent with truth as it may present itself to me at a given moment. The result has been that I have grown from truth to truth.\u201d\n      \u201cWe are constantly being astonished these days at the amazing discoveries in the field of violence. But I maintain that far more undreamt of and seemingly impossible discoveries will be made in the field of nonviolence.\u201d\n      \u201cWhere choice is set between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence ... I prefer to use arms in defense of honor rather than remain the vile witness of dishonor...\u201d\n      \u201cMorality is a contraband in war.\u201d\n      \u201cKeep your thoughts positive because your thought become YOUR WORDS.Keep your words positive because your words become YOUR BEHAVIORKeep your behavior positive because your behavior becomes YOUR HABITSKeep your habits positive because your habits become YOUR VALUESKeep your values positive because your values become YOUR DESTINY\u201d\n      \u201cDu und ich: Wir sind eins. Ich kann dir nicht wehtun, ohne mich zu verletzen.\u201d\n      \u201cWe don't use guns because we don't have guns\u201d\n      \u201cHuman beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.\u201d\n      \u201cThe good man is the friend of all living things.\u201d\n      \u201cNo hay caminos para la paz; la paz es el camino.\u201d\n      \u201cIn the wise words of Mahatma Gandhi, \"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\u201d\n      \u201cI am & have been for years a confirmed anti-vaccinationist. Anti-vaccination has no backing from the orthodox medical opinion. A medical man who expresses himself against vaccination loses caste. Tremendous pecuniary interests too have grown around vaccination.\u201d\n      \u201cHonest disagreement is often a good sign of progress.\u201d\n      \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\u201d\n      \u201cI crave to die with my hand at the spinning wheel.\u201d\n      \u201cI wanted to know the best of the life of one (Muhammad) who holds today an undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankind. I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet the scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle.\u201d\n      \u201cAll have not the same capacity. I would allow a man of intellect to earn more, I would not cramp his talent.\u201d\n      \u201cI have not conceived my mission to be that of a knight-errant wandering everywhere to deliver people from difficult situations.My humble occupation has been to show people how they can solve their own difficulties.\u201d\n      \u201cMy uniform experience has convinced me that there is no other God than Truth\u201d\n      \u201cThe history of the world is full of men who rose to leadership, by sheer force of self-confidence, bravery and tenacity.\u201d\n      \u201cAn error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it. Truth stands, even if there be no public support.

But this idea is based on a misunderstanding. Anyone who reads the Quran for himself will easily appreciate that its message has nothing to do with violence. The Quran is, from beginning to end, a book which promulgates peace and in no way countenances violence. It is true that jihad is one of the teachings of the Quran. But jihad, taken in its correct sense, is the name of peaceful struggle rather than of any kind of violent action. The Quranic concept of jihad is expressed in the following verse, \u2018Do greater jihad (i.e strive more strenuously) with the help of this [Quran]\u2019 (25:52). Obviously, the Quran is not a weapon, but a book which gives us an introduction to the divine ideology of peaceful struggle. The method of such a struggle, according to the Quran, is \u2018to speak to them a word to reach their very soul\u2019 (4:63). ========== \ufeffQuran: A Simple English Translation (Goodword !

Referring to such verses, there are some who attempt to give the impression that Islam is a religion of war and violence. This is totally untrue. Such verses relate, in a restricted sense, to those who have unilaterally attacked the Muslims.

For instance, the Gita, the holy book of the Hindus, pertains to wisdom and moral values. Yet along with this is the exhortation of Krishna to Arjuna, encouraging him to fight (Bhagavad Gita, 3:30). This does not mean that believers in the Gita should wage wars all the time. Mahatma Gandhi, after all, derived his philosophy of non-violence from the same Gita. The exhortation to wage war in the Gita applies only to exceptional cases where circumstances leave no choice. But for general day-to-day existence it gives the same peaceful commands as derived from it by Mahatma Gandhi. ========== \ufeffQuran: A Simple English Translation (Goodword !

The sum-total of that life is God.\u201d\n      \u201cMahatma Gandhi alipigwa risasi na kufariki dunia baada ya maisha yake kumfelisha. Lakini kifo chake kiliipatia India uhuru kutoka Uingereza. Hivyo, akafanikiwa.\u201d\n      \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win\u201d\n      \u201cNonviolence in its dynamic condition means conscious suffering. It does not means meek submission to the will of the evil-doer, but it means the putting of one's whole soul against the will of the tyrant. Working under this law of being, it is possible for a single individual to defy the whole might of an unjust empire to save his honor, his religion, his soul and lay the foundation for the empire's fall or its regeneration.\u201d\n      \u201cTo live simply so that others may simply live.Mahatma Gandhi\u201d\n      \u201cWeleens afgevraagd waarom ik Mahatma Gandhi zo bewonder?\u201d\n      \u201cMahatma Gandhi was never freebecause of his life and love.A result of his attitude.Religious Leader Petra Cecilia Maria HermansReligion of Blue CircleOctober 2, 2016\u201d\n      \u201cI wanted to know the best of the life of one who holds today an undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankind\u2026 I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet the scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle. When I closed the second volume (of the Prophet\u2019s biography), I was sorry there was not more for me to read of that great life.\u201d\n      \u201cMahatma Gandhi said, \u2018Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.\u201d\n      \u201cKita harus menjadi perubahan yang ingin kita lihat dari dunia.\u201d\n      \u201cDe manera apacible, se puede sacudir el mundo. MAHATMA GANDHI\u201d\n      \u201cIf you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal and if they can't stop you, then you become a legend\u201d\n      \u201cThe problem today is not lack of proper resources, but lack of proper distribution.\u201d\n      \u201cWhere there is love, there is life.\u201d\n      \u201cIf co-operation is a duty, I hold that non-co-operation also under certain conditions is equally a duty.\u201d\n      \u201cLa verdadera amistad es una identidad de almas que rara vez se encuentra en este mundo.S\u00f3lo entre naturalezas muy a fines y semejantes puede la amistad ser aut\u00e9ntica y duradera\u201d\n      \u201cThere is an indefinable mysterious power that pervades everything, I feel it though I do not see it..whilst everything around me is ever changing, ever dying there is underlying all that change a living power that is changeless, that holds all together, that creates, dissolves and recreates.. .in the midst of death life persists, in the midst of untruth truth persists, in the midst of darkness light persists.\u201d\n      \u201cThere are no good-byes, where ever you'll be, you'll be in my heart.\u201d\n      \u201cSpeak only if it improves upon the silence\u201d\n      \u201cYou must be the change you want for the world.\u201d\n      \u201c....perhaps we would engrave the words of Mahatma Gandhi, who once said, A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history.\u201d\n      \u201cSede Hanibal Barca i Filip Drugi Makedonski u nekom kaficu u Dubrovniku , te pojavi se odnekud oftamolog i upita ih -A jel'te vas dvojica , da nijeste naleteli nedje na Vasilija Drugoga Bugaroubicu ? xoxoxo\u201d\n      \u201cLebe, als w\u00fcrdest Du morgen sterben und lerne, als ob Du ewig leben w\u00fcrdest.\u201d", "author": "Mahatma Gandhi", "type": "quote", "title": "Mahatma Gandhi Quotes"}
