You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:1. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor\u2019d with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc\u2019d may be attended with much Inconvenience.4. Because thro\u2019 more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin\u2019d to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.8thly and Lastly They are so grateful!!\u201d", "      \u201cTo find out a girl's faults, praise her to her girlfriends.\u201d", "      \u201cWe must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.\u201d", "      \u201cTrouble knocked at the door, but, hearing laughter, hurried away\u201d", "      \u201cA slip of the foot you may soon recover, but a slip of the tongue you may never get over.\u201d", "      \u201cLife biggest tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late\u201d", "      \u201cIf Jack's in love, he's no judge of Jill's beauty.\u201d", "      \u201cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d", "      \u201cIf you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!\u201d", "      \u201cHappiness depends more on the inward disposition of mind than on outward circumstances.\u201d", "      \u201cKeep your eyes wide open before marriage, half shut afterwards.\u201d", "      \u201cFor the want of a nail the shoe was lost,For the want of a shoe the horse was lost,For the want of a horse the rider was lost,For the want of a rider the battle was lost,For the want of a battle the kingdom was lost,And all for the want of a horseshoe-nail.\u201d", "      \u201cWho is wise?

Deism was a philosophical belief that was widely accepted by the colonial intelligentsia at the time of the American Revolution. Its major tenets included belief in human reason as a reliable means of solving social and political problems and belief in a supreme deity who created the universe to operate solely by natural laws. The supreme God of the Deists removed himself entirely from the universe after creating it. They believed that he assumed no control over it, exerted no influence on natural phenomena, and gave no supernatural revelation to man. A necessary consequence of these beliefs was a rejection of many doctrines central to the Christian religion. Deists did not believe in the virgin birth, divinity, or resurrection of Jesus, the efficacy of prayer, the miracles of the Bible, or even the divine inspiration of the Bible.These beliefs were forcefully articulated by Thomas Paine in Age of Reason, a book that so outraged his contemporaries that he died rejected and despised by the nation that had once revered him as 'the father of the American Revolution.'... Other important founding fathers who espoused Deism were George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Ethan Allen, James Madison, and James Monroe.[The Christian Nation Myth, 1999]\u201d", "      \u201cNothing is more fatal to health than an over care of it.\u201d", "      \u201cNo gains without pains.\u201d", "      \u201cA small leak will sink a great ship.\u201d", "      \u201cWine makes daily living easier, less hurried with fewer tensions and more tolerance.\u201d", "      \u201cThat bodies should be lent us, while they can afford us pleasure, assist us in acquiring knowledge, or doing good to our fellow creatures, is a kind and benevolent act of God - when they become unfit for these purposes and afford us pain instead of pleasure-instead of an aid, become an encumbrance and answer none of the intentions for which they were given, it is equally kind and benevolent that a way is provided by which we may get rid of them.

You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:1. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor'd with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc'd may be attended with much Inconvenience.4. Because thro' more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin'd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding2 only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.8thly and Lastly They are so grateful!!Thus much for my Paradox.

I attended his famous \u201coffice hours\u201d salon only a few times. Life Studies was not a book of central importance for me, though I respected it. I admired his writing, but not the way many of my Boston friends did. Among poets in his generation, poems by Elizabeth Bishop, Alan Dugan, and Allen Ginsberg meant more to me than Lowell\u2019s. I think he probably sensed some of that.To his credit, Lowell nevertheless was generous to me (as he was to many other young poets) just the same. In that generosity, and a kind of open, omnivorous curiosity, he was different from my dear teacher at Stanford, Yvor Winters. Like Lowell, Winters attracted followers\u2014but Lowell seemed almost dismayed or a little bewildered by imitators; Winters seemed to want disciples: \u201cWintersians,\u201d they were called.A few years before I met Lowell, when I was still in California, I read his review of Winters\u2019s Selected Poems. Lowell wrote that, for him, Winters\u2019s poetry passed A. E. Housman\u2019s test: he felt that if he recited it while he was shaving, he would cut himself. One thing Lowell and Winters shared, that I still revere in both of them, was a fiery devotion to the vocal essence of poetry: the work and interplay of sentences and lines, rhythm and pitch. The poetry in the sounds of the poetry, in a reader\u2019s voice: neither page nor stage.Winters criticizing the violence of Lowell\u2019s enjambments, or Lowell admiring a poem in pentameter for its \u201cdrill-sergeant quality\u201d: they shared that way of thinking, not matters of opinion but the matter itself, passionately engaged in the art and its vocal\u2014call it \u201ctechnical\u201d\u2014materials.Lowell loved to talk about poetry and poems. His appetite for that kind of conversation seemed inexhaustible. It tended to be about historical poetry, mixed in with his contemporaries. When he asked you, what was Pope\u2019s best work, it was as though he was talking about a living colleague . . . which in a way he was. He could be amusing about that same sort of thing. He described Julius Caesar\u2019s entourage waiting in the street outside Cicero\u2019s house while Caesar chatted up Cicero about writers.\u201cThey talked about poetry,\u201d said Lowell in his peculiar drawl. \u201cCaesar asked Cicero what he thought of Jim Dickey.\u201dHis considerable comic gift had to do with a humor of self and incongruity, rather than wit. More surreal than donnish. He had a memorable conversation with my daughter Caroline when she was six years old. A tall, bespectacled man with a fringe of long gray hair came into her living room, with a certain air.\u201cYou look like somebody famous,\u201d she said to him, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember who.\u201d\u201cDo I?\u201d\u201cYes . . . now I remember!\u2014 Benjamin Franklin.\u201d\u201cHe was a terrible man, just awful.\u201d\u201cOr no, I don\u2019t mean Benjamin Franklin. I mean you look like a Christmas ornament my friend Heather made out of Play-Doh, that looked like Benjamin Franklin.\u201dThat left Robert Lowell with nothing to do but repeat himself:\u201cWell, he was a terrible man.\u201dThat silly conversation suggests the kind of social static or weirdness the man generated. It also happens to exemplify his peculiar largeness of mind . . . even, in a way, his engagement with the past. When he died, I realized that a large vacuum had appeared at the center of the world I knew.\u201d", "      \u201cAnd, lastly (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words, \"Without vanity I may say,\" etc., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for is vanity among the other comforts of life.\u201d", "      \u201cDid not strong connections draw me elsewhere, I believe Scotland would be the country I would choose to end my days in.\u201d", "      \u201cHe that composes himself is wiser than he that composes books.\u201d", "      \u201cTis hard for an empty bag to stand upright.\u201d", "      \u201cHave you ever been to the beach and wanted to feed the seagulls?

Of course, they\u2019re very tasty. Benjamin Franklin thought them majestic enough to be an emblem for our country. I\u2019m sorry, but Thanksgiving would be downright depressing. There\u2019s our national symbol lying stuffed and roasted and ready to carve up for hungry guests. And then we have the eagles. Our forefathers were trained in the Bible. [\u2026]They would have known Isaiah 40:31. \u201cThose who wait upon the Lord will gain new strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary.\u201d They were making war on the greatest power in the world of the time; the world was watching them.

Remember the movie \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d? \u201cMine, mine, mine!\u201d And we sure have a lot of gutless turkeys running for the barn whenever hard decisions have to be made; like how to keep our country solvent so our children won\u2019t be in soup lines\u2026 Where are the eagles?

It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others. Most men indeed as well as most sects in Religion, think themselves in possession of all truth, and that wherever others differ from them it is so far error. Steele a Protestant in a Dedication tells the Pope, that the only difference between our Churches in their opinions of the certainty of their doctrines is, the Church of Rome is infallible and the Church of England is never in the wrong. But though many private persons think almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of their sect. In these sentiments, Sir, I agree to this Constitution with all its faults, if they are such; because I think a general Government necessary for us, and there is no form of Government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered, and believe farther that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years, and can only end in Despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic Government, being incapable of any other. I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution. For when you assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men, all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views. From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected? It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies, who are waiting with confidence to hear that our councils are confounded like those of the Builders of Babel; and that our States are on the point of separation, only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting one another's throats. Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best. The opinions I have had of its errors, I sacrifice to the public good. I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad. Within these walls they were born, and here they shall die. If every one of us in returning to our Constituents were to report the objections he has had to it, and endeavor to gain partizans in support of them, we might prevent its being generally received, and thereby lose all the salutary effects & great advantages resulting naturally in our favor among foreign Nations as well as among ourselves, from our real or apparent unanimity.

The quote comes from the Xunzi.Xun Kuang was a Chinese Confucian philosopher that lived from 312-230 BC. His works were collected into a set of 32 books called the Xunzi, by Liu Xiang in about 818 AD. There are woodblock copies of these books that are almost 1100 years old.Book 8 is titled Ruxiao (\"The Teachings of the Ru\"). The quotation in question comes from Chapter 11 of that book. In Chinese the quote is:\u4e0d\u95fb\u4e0d\u82e5\u95fb\u4e4b, \u95fb\u4e4b\u4e0d\u82e5\u89c1\u4e4b, \u89c1\u4e4b\u4e0d\u82e5\u77e5\u4e4b, \u77e5\u4e4b\u4e0d\u82e5\u884c\u4e4bIt is derived from this paragraph:Not having heard something is not as good as having heard it; having heard it is not as good as having seen it; having seen it is not as good as knowing it; knowing it is not as good as putting it into practice. (From the John Knoblock translation, which is viewable in Google Books)The first English translation of the Xunzi was done by H.H.

Franklin suggested that such abusemight be diminished if the Dunkers published the articles of theirbelief and the rules of their discipline. Welfare replied that thiscourse of action had been discussed among his co-religionists but hadbeen rejected. He then explained their reasoning in the followingwords:When we were first drawn together as a society, it had pleased God toenlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines, which we onceesteemed truths, were errors, and that others, which we had esteemederrors, were real truths. From time to time He has been pleased toafford us farther light, and our principles have been improving, and ourerrors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the endof this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theologicalknowledge; and we fear that, if we should feel ourselves as if bound andconfined by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement,and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders andfounders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from.Franklin describes this sentiment as a singular instance in the historyof mankind of modesty in a sect.\u201d", "      \u201cBy my rambling digressions, I perceive myself to be grown old.

The New York Times editorial, reporting of his death on April 22, 1910, said. \u201c He has been quoted in common conversation oftener, perhaps, than any of his fellow-countrymen, including Benjamin Franklin and Lincoln. In 1909, Mark Twain is quoted as saying, \u201c I came in with Haley's Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Haley's Comet.

She may therefore be esteemed an emblem of vigilance. She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever surrenders: She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and true courage. As if anxious to prevent all pretensions of quarreling with her, the weapons with which nature has furnished her, she conceals in the roof of her mouth, so that, to those who are unacquainted with her, she appears to be a most defenseless animal; and even when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense, they appear weak and contemptible; but their wounds however small, are decisive and fatal.

Not the light of a rainy evening in the city, but paler, less certain. They rounded the corner. He noticed the flashlight bulb starting to flicker; lost the alligator momentarily. Then turned the corner and found a wide space like the nave of a church, an arched roof overhead, a phosphorescent light coming off walls whose exact arrangement was indistinct. \u201cWha,\u201d he said out loud. Backwash from the river? Sea water shines in the dark sometimes; in the wake of a ship you see the same uncomfortable radiance. But not here. The alligator had turned to face him. It was a clear, easy shot. He waited. He was waiting for something to happen. Something otherworldly, of course. He was sentimental and superstitious. Surely the alligator would receive the gift of tongues, the body of Father Fairing be resurrected, the sexy V. tempt him away from murder. He felt about to levitate and at a loss to say where, really, he was. In a bonecellar, a sepulchre. \u201cAh, schlemihl,\u201d he whispered into the phosphorescence. Accident prone, schlimazzel. The gun would blow up in his hands. The alligator\u2019s heart would tick on, his own would burst, mainspring and escapement rust in this shindeep sewage, in this unholy light. \u201cCan I let you just go?\u201d Bung the foreman knew he was after a sure thing. It was down on the clipboard. And then he saw the alligator couldn\u2019t go any further. Had settled down on its haunches to wait, knowing damn well it was going to be blasted. In Independence Hall in Philly, when the floor was rebuilt, they left part of the original, a foot square, to show the tourists. \u201cMaybe,\u201d the guide would tell you, \u201cBenjamin Franklin stood right there, or even George Washington.\u201d Profane on an eighth-grade class trip had been suitably impressed. He got that feeling now. Here in this room an old man had killed and boiled a catechumen, had committed sodomy with a rat, had discussed a rodent nunhood with V., a future saint\u2014depending which story you listened to. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he told the alligator. He was always saying he was sorry. It was a schlemihl\u2019s stock line. He raised the repeater to his shoulder, flicked off the safety. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said again. Father Fairing talked to rats. Profane talked to alligators. He fired. The alligator jerked, did a backflip, thrashed briefly, was still. Blood began to seep out amoebalike to form shifting patterns with the weak glow of the water.

When Voltaire, after an exile of twenty-seven years, was allowed to return to France by Louis XVI's order, Marie Antoinette never received him. True, he had too often made France and the French the butt of his satire, and he had chosen freely to live in the court of Frederick the Great. But those near Marie Antoinette believed that her reason for not receiving him was not political. She just didn't know what to say to a man of such giant intellect. When the Grand Duke and Duchess of Russia came to pay a visit, Marie Antoinette was so confused that she left their presence abruptly and went to her room. \"It is even harder to face other rulers,\" she whispered to her lady-in-waiting, \"than to face courtiers!\" Although Benjamin Franklin was living in Paris through much of their reign, the Queen never chose to see him. She was particularly uneasy with brilliant women. During the eighteenth century women in France were more powerful than in any other time in history. Their influence in worldly affairs was greater than ever before or since. In their salons the finest minds gathered, and there conversation became an art cultivated for its own sake. But Marie Antoinette avoided contact with these intellectuals. She could never in the world have taken part in their conversations. She had never been educated. She had scarcely even read a book, and she knew only too well what such a handicap meant.\u201d", "      \u201cI didn't fail the test.

I can think of no other reason why they could be so aware of events in their future, unless of course, it was because they were so aware of their past.
