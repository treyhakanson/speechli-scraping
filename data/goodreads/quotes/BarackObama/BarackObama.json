["      \u201cChange will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.\u201d", "      \u201cThe best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Don\u2019t wait for good things to happen to you.

I'm inspired by the love people have for their children. And I'm inspired by my own children, how full they make my heart. They make me want to work to make the world a little bit better. And they make me want to be a better man.\u201d", "      \u201cSometimes it takes a while to recognize that someone has a special ability to get us to believe in ourselves, to tie that belief to our highest ideals, and to imagine that together we can do great things.In those rare moments, when such a person comes along, we need to put aside our plans and reach for what we know is possible.\u201d", "      \u201cIf you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you'll make progress.\u201d", "      \u201cIf there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription, who has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer - even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American or Mexican-American family being rounded up by John Ashcroft without benefit of an attorney or due process, I know that that threatens my civil liberties. And I don't have to be a woman to be concerned that the Supreme Court is trying to take away a woman's right, because I know that my rights are next. It is that fundamental belief - I am my brother\u2019s keeper, I am my sister\u2019s keeper - that makes this country work.\u201d", "      \u201cThere's not a liberal America and a conservative America - there's the United States of America.\u201d", "      \u201cWe don't ask you to believe in our ability to bring change, rather, we ask you to believe in yours.\u201d", "      \u201cWhat I\u2019ve realized is that life doesn\u2019t count for much unless you\u2019re willing to do your small part to leave our children \u2014 all of our children \u2014 a better world.

And it will leave you unfulfilled.\u201d", "      \u201cNo, you can't deny women their basic rights and pretend it's about your 'religious freedom'. If you don't like birth control, don't use it.

If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way.
