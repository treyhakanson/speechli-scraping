When I do bad, I feel bad. That's my religion.\u201d\n      \u201cNo matter how old you are now. You are never too young or too old for success or going after what you want.

I must get to know him better.\u201d\n      \u201cWhen you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on.\u201d\n      \u201cBe sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.\u201d\n      \u201cI am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true.

Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.\u201d\n      \u201cI would rather be a little nobody, then to be a evil somebody.\u201d\n      \u201cYou can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time.\u201d\n      \u201cAll that I am or ever hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.\u201d\n      \u201cCharacter is like a tree and reputation its shadow. The shadow is what we think it is and the tree is the real thing.\u201d\n      \u201cI have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had no where else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day.\u201d\n      \u201cAlways bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing.\u201d\n      \u201cNo man is poor who has a Godly mother.\u201d\n      \u201cI laugh because I must not cry, that is all, that is all. \u201d\n      \u201cThe best way to predict your future is to create it.\u201d\n      \u201cYou can fool some people some times but you cant fool all the people all the time\u201d\n      \u201cTact: the ability to describe others as they see themselves.\u201d\n      \u201cI will prepare and some day my chance will come.\u201d\n      \u201cElections belong to the people.

I never did like to work, and I don't deny it. I'd rather read, tell stories, crack jokes, talk, laugh -- anything but work.\u201d\n      \u201cNo man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar\u201d\n      \u201cThe best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.\u201d\n      \u201cGive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\u201d\n      \u201cI have always found that mercy bears richer fruits than strict justice.\u201d\n      \u201cHe has a right to criticize, who has a heart to help.\u201d\n      \u201cThings may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.\u201d\n      \u201cAll I have learned, I learned from books.\u201d\n      \u201cI care not for a man's religion whose dog and cat are not the better for it.\u201d\n      \u201cEvery man's happiness is his own responsibility.\u201d\n      \u201cYou cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.\u201d\n      \u201cI do not think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday.\u201d\n      \u201cIt's not me who can't keep a secret. It's the people I tell that can't.\u201d\n      \u201cThe Lord prefers common-looking people. That is why he made so many of them.\u201d\n      \u201cIt has been my experience that folks who have no vices have very few virtues.\u201d\n      \u201cYou have to do your own growing no matter how tall your grandfather was.\u201d\n      \u201cIn this sad world of ours sorrow comes to all and it often comes with bitter agony. Perfect relief is not possible except with time. You cannot now believe that you will ever feel better. But this is not true. You are sure to be happy again. Knowing this, truly believing it will make you less miserable now. I have had enough experience to make this statement.\u201d\n      \u201cYou cannot help people permanently by doing for them, what they could and should do for themselves.\u201d\n      \u201cIf this is coffee, please bring me some tea; but if this is tea, please bring me some coffee.\u201d\n      \u201cYou can tell the greatness of a man by what makes him angry\u201d\n      \u201cIt is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him.\u201d\n      \u201cA house divided against itself cannot stand.\" I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved \u2014 I do not expect the house to fall \u2014 but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.\u201d\n      \u201cI am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts, and beer.\u201d\n      \u201cThe better part of one's life consists of his friendships.\u201d\n      \u201cI am not concerned that you have fallen -- I am concerned that you arise.\u201d\n      \u201cTo ease another\u2019s heartache is to forget one\u2019s own.\u201d\n      \u201cI don't know who my grandfather was; I am much more concerned to know what his grandson will be.\u201d\n      \u201cThe probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter usfrom the support of a cause we believe to be just.\u201d\n      \u201cAchievement has no color\u201d\n      \u201cWhen I get ready to talk to people, I spend two thirds of the time thinking what they want to hear and one third thinking about what I want to say.\u201d\n      \u201cNo matter how much the cats fight, there always seem to be plenty of kittens. \u201d\n      \u201cI do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and I mean to keep on doing so until the end.\u201d\n      \u201cBe with a leader when he is right, stay with him when he is still right, but, leave him when he is wrong.\u201d\n      \u201cFrom whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some trans-Atlantic military giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never. All the armies of Europe and Asia...could not by force take a drink from the Ohio River or make a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. No, if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide.\u201d\n      \u201cWe should be too big to take offense and too noble to give it.\u201d\n      \u201cI have come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying, and for this reason, I can never be satisfied with anyone who would be blockhead enough to have me.\u201d\n      \u201cMy great concern is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with your failure.\u201d\n      \u201cThe ballot is stronger than the bullet.\u201d\n      \u201cThe greatest fine art of the future will be the making of a comfortable living from a small piece of land.\u201d\n      \u201cYou can have anything you want if you want it badly enough. You can be anything you want to be, do anything you set out to accomplish if you hold to that desire with singleness of purpose.\u201d\n      \u201cAs I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.\u201d\n      \u201cHonor to the soldier and sailor everywhere, who bravely bears his country's cause. Honor, also, to the citizen who cares for his brother in the field and serves, as he best can, the same cause.\u201d\n      \u201cIf there is anything that links the human to the divine, it is the courage to stand by a principle when everybody else rejects it.\u201d\n      \u201cGet books, sit yourself down anywhere, and go to reading them yourself.\u201d\n      \u201cDie when I may, I want it said of me by those who knew me best, that I always plucked a thistle and planted a flower where I thought a flower would grow.\u201d\n      \u201cHypocrite: The man who murdered his parents, and then pleaded for mercy on the grounds that he was an orphan.\u201d\n      \u201cIf this country is ever demoralized, it will come from trying to live without work.\u201d\n      \u201cStand with anyone that is right; stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words, \"And this too, shall pass away.\" How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride! How consoling in the depths of affliction!\u201d\n      \u201cDon\u2019t criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.\u201d\n      \u201cThose who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves, and, under a just God cannot retain it.\u201d\n      \u201cYou cannot build character and courage by taking away people's initiative and independence\u201d\n      \u201cTake all that you can of this book upon reason, and the balance on faith, and you will live and die a happier man. (When a skeptic expressed surprise to see him reading a Bible)\u201d\n      \u201cLet no feeling of discouragement preyupon you, and in the end you are sure to succeed.\u201d\n      \u201cDetermine that the thing can and shall be done and then... find the way.\u201d\n      \u201cThose who write clearly have readers, those who write obscurely have commentators.\u201d\n      \u201cRepublicans are for both the man and the dollar, but in case of conflict the man before the dollar.\u201d\n      \u201cOur safety, our liberty, depends upon preserving the Constitution of the United States as our fathers made it inviolate. The people of the United States are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.\u201d\n      \u201cMy father taught me to work; he did not teach me to love it.\u201d\n      \u201cDon't interfere with anything in the Constitution. That must be maintained, for it is the only safeguard of our liberties.\u201d\n      \u201cIn this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all; and, to the young, it comes with bitterest agony, because it takes them unawares. The older have learned to ever expect it. I am anxious to afford some alleviation of your present distress. Perfect relief is not possible, except with time. You can not now realize that you will ever feel better. Is not this so? And yet it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy again. To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable now. I have had experience enough to know what I say; and you need only to believe it, to feel better at once.\u201d\n      \u201cCommitment is what transforms a promise into reality.\u201d\n      \u201cThe dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.\u201d\n      \u201cWe the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.\u201d\n      \u201cLets have faith that right makes might; and in that faith let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\u201d\n      \u201cA capacity, and taste, for reading, gives access to whatever has already been discovered by others. It is the key, or one of the keys, to the already solved problems. And not only so. It gives a relish, and facility, for successfully pursuing the [yet] unsolved ones.\u201d\n      \u201cShakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln never saw a movie, heard a radio or looked at television. They had 'Loneliness' and knew what to do with it. They were not afraid of being lonely because they knew that was when the creative mood in them would work.\u201d\n      \u201cThat some achieve great success, is proof to all that others can achieve it as well.\u201d\n      \u201cin times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and eternity.\u201d\n      \u201cI see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. . . . corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.\u201d\n      \u201cIf frienship is your weakest point then you are the strongest person in the world.\u201d\n      \u201cForce is all conquering, but it's victories are short lived.\u201d\n      \u201cProhibition... goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded.\u201d\n      \u201cYou can\u2019t make a weak man strong by making a strong man weak\u201d\n      \u201cI believe the Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man. All the good from The Savior of the world is communicated to us through this Book.\u201d\n      \u201cAllow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose -- and you allow him to make war at pleasure. . . . If, today, he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, 'I see no probability of the British invading us'; but he will say to you, 'Be silent; I see it, if you don't.\u201d\n      \u201cIf I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how - the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what's said against me won't amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference.\u201d\n      \u201cYou cannot lift the wage earner up by pulling the wage payer down.\u201d\n      \u201cCongressmen who willfully take action during wartime that damages morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested, exiled, or hung\u201d\n      \u201cA woman is the only thing I am afraid of that I know will not hurt me.\u201d\n      \u201cA tendancy to melancholy...let it be observed, is a misfortune, not a fault.\u201d\n      \u201cThat some should be rich shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another; but let him labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence built.\u201d\n      \u201cLife is hard but so very beautiful\u201d\n      \u201cNothing will divert me from my purpose.\u201d\n      \u201cIt often requires more courage to dare to do right than to fear to do wrong.\u201d\n      \u201cYou cannot have the right to do what is wrong!\u201d\n      \u201cHere in my heart, my happiness, my house.Here inside the lighted window is my love, my hope, my life.Peace is my companion on the pathway winding to the threshold.Inside this portal dwells new strength in the security, serenity, and radiance of those I love above life itself.Here two will build new dreams--dreams that tomorrow will come true.The world over, these are the thoughts at eventide when footsteps turn ever homeward.In the haven of the hearthside is rest and peace and comfort.\u201d\n      \u201cI know there is a God, and that He hates injustice and slavery. I see the storm coming, and I know that his hand is in it. If He has a place and work for me - and I think He has - I believe I am ready.\u201d\n      \u201cNo man is good enough to govern another man without that other\u2019s consent.\u201d\n      \u201cThe philosophy of the schoolroom in one generation is the philosophy of government in the next.\u201d\n      \u201cExecutive Mansion,Washington, Nov. 21, 1864.Dear Madam,--I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.Yours, very sincerely and respectfully,A. Lincoln\u201d\n      \u201cWomen are the only people I am afraid of who I never thought would hurt me\u201d\n      \u201cDon't worry when you are not recognized but strive to be worthy of recognition\u201d\n      \u201cIf any man tells you he loves America, yet hates labor, he is a liar. If any man tells you he trusts America, yet fears labor, he is a fool.\u201d\n      \u201cAnybody will do for you, but not for me. I must have somebody.\u201d\n      \u201cI have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.\u201d\n      \u201cUpon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in.\u201d\n      \u201cThe mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.--as quoted in THE RIVER OF WINGED DREAMS\u201d\n      \u201cA friend is one who has the same enemies as you have.\u201d\n      \u201cI like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives. I like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him. \u201d\n      \u201cI don't like to hear cut and dried sermons. No\u2014when I hear a man preach, I like to see him act as if he were fighting bees.\u201d\n      \u201cTo fail to experience gratitude when walking through the corridors of the Metropolitan Museum, when listening to the music of Bach or Beethoven, when exercising our freedom to speak, or ... to give, or withhold, our assent, is to fail to recognize how much we have received from the great wellsprings of human talent and concern that gave us Shakespeare, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, our parents, our friends. We need a rebirth of gratitude for those who have cared for us, living and, mostly, dead. The high moments of our way of life are their gifts to us. We must remember them in our thoughts and in our prayers; and in our deeds.\u201d\n      \u201cEducation does not mean teaching people what they do not know. It means teaching them to behave as they do not behave.\u201d\n      \u201cIn great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be wrong. God cannot be for, and against the same thing at the same time.\u201d\n      \u201cThrough their deeds, the dead of battle have spoken more eloquently for themselves than any of the living ever could. But we can only honor them by rededicating ourselves to the cause for which they gave a last full measure of devotion. \u201d\n      \u201cDiscourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser - in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be business enough.\u201d\n      \u201cNeither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction ... nor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\u201d\n      \u201cI remember my mother's prayers and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all my life.\u201d\n      \u201cI am nothing, truth is everything.\u201d\n      \u201cLabor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.\u201d\n      \u201cBut for this book we could not know right from wrong.\u201d\n      \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my experience. Humbling to the point where you have major regrets about some of the stupid things you said, some of the things you thought were right. You keep going to these countries, and it\u2019s like, you forgot the lesson from the last time. Because the first person you encounter kind of bitch-slaps you upside the head in the most wonderful, innocent way and you realize, God, I\u2019m still an asshole. And this guy, by doing nothing except being broke and so incredibly polite\u2014it takes you aback, you realize, I\u2019m still not there yet. I still have like eight miles to go before I can even get into the parking lot of humility. I have to keep going back. It\u2019s like going back to a chiropractor to get a readjustment. That\u2019s me in Africa, that\u2019s me in Southeast Asia. You come back humbled and you bring that into your life. It\u2019s made me much more tolerant of other peoples\u2014and I\u2019m not saying I used to be a misogynist, or I used to be a racist, that was never my problem. But I can be extremely headstrong, impatient, rude. Like, \u201cHurry up, man. What\u2019s your problem? Get out of my way.\u201d That sentiment comes easy to me. Going to these countries, you realize none of that is necessary, none of it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s nothing Abraham Lincoln would do, and so why are you doing it? Those are the lessons I\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n      \u201cIn regards to this great Book [the Bible], I have but to say it is the best gift God has given to man. All the good the Savior gave to the world was communicated through this Book. But for it we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are found portrayed in it.\u201d\n      \u201cGentlemen, why do you not laugh? With the fearful strain that is upon me day and night, if I did not laugh, I should die. \u201d\n      \u201cIf slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.\u201d\n      \u201cBetter to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.\u201d\n      \u201cSomeone asked me...how it felt and I was reminded of a story that a fellow townsman of ours used to tell--Abraham Lincoln. They asked him how he felt once after an unsuccessful election. He said he felt like a little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark. He said that he was too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh.\u201d\n      \u201cNever do anything for anyone who can just as well do it themself\u201d\n      \u201cIt will not do to investigate the subject of religion too closely, as it is apt to lead to infidelity.\u201d\n      \u201cThe will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both *may* be, and one *must* be, wrong. God cannot be *for* and *against* the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party - and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaption to effect His purpose. I am almost ready to say that this is probably true - that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By His mere great power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either *saved* or *destroyed* the Union without human contest. Yet the contest began, And, having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.\u201d\n      \u201cWith educated people, I suppose, punctuation is a matter of rule; with me it is a matter of feeling. But I must say I have a great respect for the semicolin; it's a useful little chap\u201d\n      \u201cTis better people think you a fool, then open your mouth and erase all doubt.\u201d\n      \u201cThe most sanctified figure in American historiography is, by no accident, the Great Saint of centralizing \"democracy\" and the strong unitary nation-state: Abraham Lincoln. And so didn't Lincoln use force and violence, and on a massive scale, on behalf of the mystique of the sacred \"Union,\" to prevent the South from seceding? Indeed he did, and on the foundation of mass murder and oppression, Lincoln crushed the South and outlawed the very notion of secession (based on the highly plausible ground that since the separate states voluntarily entered the Union they should be allowed to leave). But not only that: for Lincoln created the monstrous unitary nation-state from which individual and local liberties have never recovered.\u201d\n      \u201cno man who is resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention, still less can he afford to take the consequences, including the vitiation of his temper and the loss of self control, yield to larger things to which you show no more than equal rights, and yield to lesser ones though clearly your own, better give your path to a dog, than be bitten by him in contesting for the right, not even killing the dog, will cure the bite\u201d\n      \u201cI do the very best I can, I mean to keep going. If the end brings me out all right, then what is said against me won't matter. If I'm wrong, ten angels swearing I was right won't make a difference.\u201d\n      \u201cIf you think you can you can, if you think you can't you're right!\u201d\n      \u201cTruth is generally the best vindication against slander\u201d\n      \u201cI am rather inclined to silence, and whether that be wise or not, it is at least more unusual nowadays to find a man who can hold his tongue than to find one who cannot.\u201d\n      \u201cI know not how to aid you, save in the assurance of one of mature age, and much severe experience, that you can not fail, if you resolutely determine, that you will not.\u201d\n      \u201cSame difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThe South lost and the North won. Abraham Lincoln came and gave the Emancipation Proclamation.\u201d\u201cThe Gettysburg Address,\u201d Mrs. Anderson said. \u201cThe Emancipation Proclamation was delivered six months before the battle.\u201dHe gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cWho's giving the report here?\u201dShe waved her hand. \u201cProceed then.\u201d\u201cLike I said, the North won. The slaves were all freed. Hurrah, hurrah. The end.\u201d\n      \u201cI never had a policy; I have just tried to do my very best each and every day.\u201d\n      \u201cPeople who have no vices, have very few virtues.\u201d\n      \u201cLove is the chain whereby to lock a child to its parent.\u201d\n      \u201cIn this age, in this country, public sentiment is everything. With it, nothing can fail; against it, nothing can succeed. Whoever molds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces judicial decisions.\u201d\n      \u201cAbraham Lincoln did not shoot John Wilkes Booth. Titanic did not sink a North Atlantic iceberg. And Fox News is neither fair nor balanced. These are simple historical facts intelligible to all adults, most children, and some of your more discerning domesticated animals. But not... to Bill O\u201d\n      \u201cI am very little inclined on any occasion to say anything unless I hope to produce some good by it.\u201d\n      \u201cI have never studied the art of paying compliments to women; but I must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of America, it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war.\u201d\n      \u201cThe written word may be man's greatest invention. It allows us toconverse with the dead, the absent, and the unborn.\u201d\n      \u201cI belive that people should fight for what they believe and only what they believe.\u201d\n      \u201cYou don't get drown by falling into a river. You get drown by remaining there. Falling accidentally and rising immediately was what distinguished Thomas Edison and Abraham Lincoln from the rest.\u201d\n      \u201cMost folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.\u201d\n      \u201cThe leading rule for the lawyer, as for the man of every other calling, is diligence. Leave nothing for to-morrow which can be done to-day.\u201d\n      \u201cI am a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn't have the heart to let him down...\u201d\n      \u201cIn giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth\u201d\n      \u201cMy earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures have become clearer and stronger with advancing years, and I see no reason for thinking I shall ever change them.\u201d\n      \u201cBased on what you know about him in history books, what do you think Abraham Lincoln would be doing if he were alive today? 1) Writing his memoirs of the Civil War. 2) Advising the President. 3) Desperately clawing at the inside of his coffin. \u201d\n      \u201cI was a little cross.I ask pardon. If I do get up a little temper I have no sufficient time to keep it up.\u201d\n      \u201cif you want your name to be remembered after your death either do something worth writing or write some thing worth reading\u201d\n      \u201cWell, I wish some of you would tell me the brand of whiskey that Grant drinks. I would like to send a barrel of it to my other generals.\u201d\n      \u201cThe legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but can not do at all, or can not so well do, for themselves \u2013 in their separate, and individual capacities.\u201d\n      \u201cyou can't escape tomorrow's responsibilities by evading it today\u201d\n      \u201cThe bottom half of the page had descended into a doodle of a tiny man giving the middle finger to a giant, angry eagle with razor-sharp talons. Beneath it, the caption: To Mock a Killing Bird.\u201d\n      \u201cAbraham Lincoln was asked by an aide about the church service he had attended. Lincoln responded that the minister was inspired, interesting, well-prepared, eloquent and the topic relevant. The aide said, \u201cThen it was a good service?\u201dLincoln responded, \u201cNo.\u201d The aide protested,\u201cBut, Mr. President, you said that the minister was inspired, interesting, well-prepared, eloquent, and that the topic was relevant.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d replied Lincoln, \u201cbut he didn\u2019t challenge us to do any great thing.\u201d\n      \u201cHe can compress the most words into the smallest ideas of any man I ever met.\u201d\n      \u201cI am slow to learn and slow to forget that which I have learned. My mind is like a piece of steel, very hard to scratch any thing on it and almost impossible after you get it there to rub it out.\u201d\n      \u201cA farce or comedy is best played; a tragedy is best read at home.\u201d\n      \u201cBelieving everyone is dangerous, but believing nobody is more dangerous.\u201d\n      \u201cA house divided cannot stand.\u201d\n      \u201cThe world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the American people, just now, are much in want of one. We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing. With some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product of other men\u2019s labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatible things, called by the same name, liberty. And it follows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatible names, liberty and tyranny. The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep\u2019s throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as a liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep was a black one. Plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty.\u201d\n      \u201cLet every American, every lover of liberty, every well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the Revolution, never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their violation by others.\u201d\n      \u201cI am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.\u201d\n      \u201cHere is Abraham Lincoln\u2019s touching condolence letter to 22-year-old Fanny McCullough, the daughter of a long-time friend:\u201cDear FannyIt is with deep grief that I learn of the death of your kind and brave Father; and, especially, that it is affecting your young heart beyond what is common in such cases. In this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all; and, to the young, it comes with bitterest agony, because it takes them unawares. The older have learned to ever expect it. I am anxious to afford some alleviation of your present distress. Perfect relief is not possible, except with time. You can not now realize that you will ever feel better. Is not this so? And yet it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy again. To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable now. I have had experience enough to know what I say; and you need only to believe it, to feel better at once. The memory of your dear Father, instead of an agony, will yet be a sad sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer and holier sort than you have known before.Please present my kind regards to your afflicted mother.Your sincere friend,A. Lincoln\u201d\n      \u201cWhat is to be, will be, and no prayers of ours can arrest the decree.[Lincoln's maxim and philosophy]\u201d\n      \u201cThe best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly.\u201d\n      \u201cWhat is conservatism?

May be there are other things that your special case requires to make you happy, but my friend, these, i reckon, will give you a good life.\u201d\n      \u201cI have always thought that all men should be free; but if any should be slaves, it should be first those who desire for themselves, and secondly those who desire it for others. Whenever I hear anyone arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.\u201d\n      \u201cLet not him who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him work diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built.\u201d\n      \u201cToo big to cry too young to laugh...\u201d\n      \u201cAnd in the end, it's not the years in your life that count.

By the adoption of these principles, the long-felt want for a uniform medium will be satisfied. The taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest, discounts and exchanges. The financing of all public enterprises, the maintenance of stable government and ordered progress, and the conduct of the Treasury will become matters of practical administration. The people can and will be furnished with a currency as safe as their own government. Money will cease to be the master and become the servant of humanity. Democracy will rise superior to the money power.\u201d\n      \u201cEverybody likes compliment.\u201d\n      \u201ca house divided against itself cannot stand\u201d\n      \u201cImportant principles may and must be inflexible.\u201d\n      \u201cIF you are going to fight, don't let them talk you into negotiating.

It was the Republicans in Congress who authored the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments giving former slaves citizenship, voting rights, and due process of law. The Democrats on the other hand were the Party of Jim Crow. It was Democrats who defended the rights of slave owners. It was the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower who championed the Civil Rights Act of 1957, but it was Democrats in the Senate who filibustered the bill.\u201d\n      \u201cThe will of God prevails.

You cannot help people permanently by doing for them, what they could and should do for themselves.\u201d\n      \u201cThink about it...

I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be religiously observed.\u201d\n      \u201cPresidents lie all the time. Really great presidents lie. Abraham Lincoln managed to end slavery in America partially by deception. (In an 1858 debate, he flatly insisted that he had no intention of abolishing slavery in states where it was already legal\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had to say this in order to slow the tide of secession.) Franklin Roosevelt lied about the U.S. position of neutrality until we entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor. (Though the public and Congress believed his public pledge of impartiality, he was already working in secret with Winston Churchill and selling arms to France.) Ronald Reagan lied about Iran-Contra so much that it now seems like he was honestly confused. Politically, the practice of lying is essential. By the time the Lewinsky story broke, Clinton had already lied about many, many things. (He\u2019d openly lied about his level of commitment to gay rights during the \u201992 campaign.) The presidency is not a job for an honest man. It\u2019s way too complex.

Allow me to assure you that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation.

And if I can learn what it is, I will do it! These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a direct revelation.

O Memory! thou midway world 'Twixt earth and paradise, Where things decayed and loved ones lost In dreamy shadows rise, And, freed from all that's earthly vile, Seem hallowed, pure, and bright, Like scenes in some enchanted isle All bathed in liquid light. As dusky mountains please the eye When twilight chases day; As bugle-notes that, passing by, In distance die away; As leaving some grand waterfall, We, lingering, list its roar-- So memory will hallow all We've known, but know no more. Near twenty years have passed away Since here I bid farewell To woods and fields, and scenes of play, And playmates loved so well. Where many were, but few remain Of old familiar things; But seeing them, to mind again The lost and absent brings. The friends I left that parting day, How changed, as time has sped! Young childhood grown, strong manhood gray, And half of all are dead. I hear the loved survivors tell How nought from death could save, Till every sound appears a knell, And every spot a grave. I range the fields with pensive tread, And pace the hollow rooms, And feel (companion of the dead) I'm living in the tombs.\u201d\n      \u201cI fear you do not fully comprehend the danger of abridging the liberties of the people.

He was also president of the Chicago Public Library. Ralph used to huff about that phrase, A picture is worth a thousand words and ask, \"Does anyone really stop to figure out what you could do with a thousand words?\"And, rather in the way that my daughters and I trade, try out, and create stories with each other, my stepfather and I spread out a napkin and came up with this:One picture is worth a thousand words? You give me a thousand words and I can give you:the Lord's Prayer, the Twenty-third Psalm, the Hippocratic Oath, a sonnet by Shakespeare, the Preamble to the Constitution, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, the last graphs of Martin Luther King's speech to the March on Washington, and the final entry of Anne Frank's diary.You give me a thousand words, and I don't think I'd trade you for any picture on earth.\u201d\n      \u201cIf my father's son can become President of these United States, then your father's son can become anything he wishes.\u201d\n      \u201cAnd this, too, shall pass away.\u201d\n      \u201cIf at first you don't succeed, just study the life of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n      \u201cAny people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better.

And in spite of its magnificence, I wouldn't stop there.I would move on by Greece and take my mind to Mount Olympus. And I would see Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Euripides and Aristophanes assembled around the Parthenon.

Let him learn early that the bullies are the easiest to tick.Teach him, if you can, the wonder of books... but also give him quiet time to ponder over the eternal mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and flowers on a green hill.In school teach him it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat.Teach him to have faith in his own ideas, even if every one tells him they are wrong.Teach him to be gentle with gentle people and tough with the tough.Try to give my son the strength not to follow the crowd when every one is getting on the bandwagon.Teach him to listen to all men but teach him also to filter all he hears on a screen of truth and take only the good that comes through.Teach him, if you can, how to laugh when he is sad. Teach him there is no shame in tears. Teach him to scoff at cynics and to beware of too much sweetness.Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders; but never to put a price tag on his heart and soul.Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob\u2026 and to stand and fight if he thinks he\u2019s right.Treat him gently; but do not cuddle him because only the test of fire makes fine steel.Let him have the courage to be impatient, let him have the patience to be brave. Teach him always to have sublime faith in himself because then he will always have sublime faith in mankind.This is a big order; but see what you can do.

Some sayI smashed my father\u2019s idols and walked away.Or walked towards a desert of barren promises.Or promises that are hummingbirds hovering fora moment then drifting away. Even now, walkingtowards that mountain, sometimes I will watchmy shadow sitting beneath a plane tree, casting dice,ignoring my steps. Some of you made me a founderbut it was only that shadow.

Is there greater fame than to be removed to the timeless sphere of mythical existence?\u201d\n      \u201cFourscore and seven years ago...\u201d\n      \u201cThere are many who profess to be religious and speak of themselves as Christians, and, according to one such, \u201cas accepting the scriptures only as sources of inspiration and moral truth,\u201d and then ask in their smugness: \u201cDo the revelations of God give us a handrail to the kingdom of God, as the Lord\u2019s messenger told Lehi, or merely a compass?\u201dUnfortunately, some are among us who claim to be Church members but are somewhat like the scoffers in Lehi\u2019s vision\u2014standing aloof and seemingly inclined to hold in derision the faithful who choose to accept Church authorities as God\u2019s special witnesses of the gospel and his agents in directing the affairs of the Church.There are those in the Church who speak of themselves as liberals who, as one of our former presidents has said, \u201cread by the lamp of their own conceit.\u201d (Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine [Deseret Book Co., 1939], p. 373.) One time I asked one of our Church educational leaders how he would define a liberal in the Church. He answered in one sentence: \u201cA liberal in the Church is merely one who does not have a testimony.\u201dDr. John A. Widtsoe, former member of the Quorum of the Twelve and an eminent educator, made a statement relative to this word liberal as it applied to those in the Church. This is what he said:\u201cThe self-called liberal [in the Church] is usually one who has broken with the fundamental principles or guiding philosophy of the group to which he belongs. . . . He claims membership in an organization but does not believe in its basic concepts; and sets out to reform it by changing its foundations. . . .\u201cIt is folly to speak of a liberal religion, if that religion claims that it rests upon unchanging truth.\u201dAnd then Dr. Widtsoe concludes his statement with this: \u201cIt is well to beware of people who go about proclaiming that they are or their churches are liberal. The probabilities are that the structure of their faith is built on sand and will not withstand the storms of truth.\u201d (\u201cEvidences and Reconciliations,\u201d Improvement Era, vol. 44 [1941], p. 609.)Here again, to use the figure of speech in Lehi\u2019s vision, they are those who are blinded by the mists of darkness and as yet have not a firm grasp on the \u201ciron rod.\u201dWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if, when there are questions which are unanswered because the Lord hasn\u2019t seen fit to reveal the answers as yet, all such could say, as Abraham Lincoln is alleged to have said, \u201cI accept all I read in the Bible that I can understand, and accept the rest on faith.\u201d . . .Wouldn\u2019t it be a great thing if all who are well schooled in secular learning could hold fast to the \u201ciron rod,\u201d or the word of God, which could lead them, through faith, to an understanding, rather than to have them stray away into strange paths of man-made theories and be plunged into the murky waters of disbelief and apostasy? . . .Cyprian, a defender of the faith in the Apostolic Period, testified, and I quote, \u201cInto my heart, purified of all sin, there entered a light which came from on high, and then suddenly and in a marvelous manner, I saw certainty succeed doubt.\u201d . . .The Lord issued a warning to those who would seek to destroy the faith of an individual or lead him away from the word of God or cause him to lose his grasp on the \u201ciron rod,\u201d wherein was safety by faith in a Divine Redeemer and his purposes concerning this earth and its peoples.The Master warned: \u201cBut whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better \u2026 that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\u201d (Matt. 18:6.)The Master was impressing the fact that rather than ruin the soul of a true believer, it were better for a person to suffer an earthly death than to incur the penalty of jeopardizing his own eternal destiny.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is the eternal struggle between these two principles - right and wrong - throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time; and wll ever to struggle.\u201d\n      \u201cIf Abraham Lincoln were alive now, he'd roll over in his grave.\u201d\n      \u201cAllow me to assure you it is a perfect certainty that you will, very soon, feel better - quite happy - if you only stick to the resolution you have taken to procure a military education. I am older than you, have felt badly myself, and know, what I tell you is true. Adhere to your purpose and you will soon feel as well as you ever did. On the contrary, if you falter, and give up, you will lose the power of keeping any resolution, and will regret it all you life.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is no longer enough to just be a good person. We must work to be the next Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther King. It is noble to strive to be the size of the bronze giant they dedicated this morning in the building behind me.

They meant simply to declare the right; so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit.\u201d\n      \u201cQuarrel not at all.

No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free--honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail.

And we are straightening out this country.\u201d - Both Quotes Taken From Aol News - August 31, 2018In The United States, as in other Republics, the two main categories of Presidential motivation for their assigned tasks are #1: Self Interest in seeking to attain and to hold on to political power for their own sakes, regarding the welfare of This Republic to be of secondary importance. #2: Seeking to attain and to hold on to the power of that same office for the selfless sake of this Republic's welfare, irregardless of their personal interest, and in the best of cases going against their personal interests to do what is best for this Republic even if it means making profound and extreme personal sacrifices. Abraham Lincoln understood this last mentioned motivation and gave his life for it. The primary information any political scientist needs to ascertain regarding the diagnosis of a particular President's modus operandi is to first take an insightful and detailed look at the individual's past. The litmus test always being what would he or she be willing to sacrifice for the Nation. In the case of our current President, Donald John Trump, he abandoned a life of liberal luxury linked to self imposed limited responsibilities for an intensely grueling, veritably non stop twoyear nightmare of criss crossing this immense Country's varied terrain, both literally and socially when he could have easily maintained his life of liberal leisure. While my assertion that his personal choice was, in my view, sacrificially done for the sake of a great power in a state of rapid decline can be contradicted by saying it was motivated by selfish reasons, all evidence points to the contrary. For knowing the human condition, fraught with a plentitude of weaknesses, for a man in the end portion of his lifetime to sacrifice an easy life for a hard working incessant schedule of thankless tasks it is entirely doubtful that this choice was made devoid of a special and even exalted inspiration to do so. And while the right motivations are pivotal to a President's success, what is also obviously needed are generic and specific political, military and ministerial skills which must be naturally endowed by Our Creator upon the particular President elected for the purposes of advancing a Nation's general well being for one and all. If one looks at the latest National statistics since President Trump took office, (such as our rising GNP, the booming market, the dramatically shrinking unemployment rate, and the overall positive emotive strains in regards to our Nation's future, on both the left and the right) one can make definitive objective conclusions pertaining to the exceptionally noble character and efficiency of the current resident at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And if one can drown out the constant communicative assaults on our current Commander In Chief, and especially if one can honestly assess the remarkable lack of substantial mistakes made by the current President, all of these factors point to a leader who is impressively strong, morally and in other imperative ways. And at the most propitious time. For the main reason that so many people in our Republic palpably despise our current President is that his political and especially his social agenda directly threatens their licentious way of life. - John Lars Zwerenz\u201d\n      \u201cThe money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than a monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish than bureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies, all who question its methods or throw light upon its crimes.\u201d\n      \u201cFALSE EQUIVALENCYIf you compare the Koch brothers to George Soros and you compare MSNBC to FOX News then why not compare the NAACP to the Ku Klux Klan, George Washington to King George, Abraham Lincoln to Jefferson Davis, Barack Obama to Vladimir Putin; If you compare the Democratic party to the Republican party then why not compare Citizens United with Brown versus Board of Education, Churchill to Mussolini, Martin Luther King to George Wallace;If you compare Liberals to Conservatives then why not compare Boxing to Cage Fighting, Mozart to Salieri, Edward Kennedy Ellington to Lawrence Welk, Three Card Monty to Inside Trading, John Birks Gillespie to Cab Callaway;If you are mentally slothful enough to engage in false equivalency, why not go all the way?

On that same date the German Hohenzollern royal family was developed from former emperors, kings, princes who were descended of the Germanic kingdoms scattered throughout central Europe.On April 9, 1865, in America, General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate States of America, ended the Civil War by surrendering to General Ulysses S. Grant, Commander of the United States Forces. It wasn\u2019t even a week later, when on April 14th, Abraham Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth, while watching \u201cOur American Cousin\u201d at the Ford Theater. The following day, as Lincoln lay dying in Washington, D.C., Otto Von Bismarck, a conservative Prussian statesman was elevated to the rank of Count of Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen in Europe. During the second half of the 19th century as Bismarck ran German and dominated European history, Cuba fought for its independence from Spain. On April 25, 1898, at the start of the Industrial Revolution, the United States declared war against Spain. The century ended with turmoil in Europe, a free Cuba and the United States as the new world power!\u201d\n      \u201cThings may come to those who wait but only the things left by those who hustle.\u201d\n      \u201cA capacity, and taste, for reading gives access to whatever has already been discovered by others\u201d\n      \u201cWhatever you are, be a good one\"-Abraham Lincoln\u201d\n      \u201cThe only difference between stepping stones and stumbling blocks is the way we address the rocks cast into our path.\u201d\n      \u201cI would be a little nobody, than to be an evil somebody.\u201d\n      \u201cA drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\u201d\n      \u201cIndeed, no doubt that Abraham Lincoln's image charm can close one's mouth and mind, and it does, whether one is the highest figure or any institution.

Likewise, you will never be able to stop negative thoughts from entering your mind, but you will have to learn to control and replace them. Positive thoughts on the other hand, are like good productive plants. In order for them to enter, and take root in your mind, you have to make deliberate and not stop efforts.\u201d- Sekou Obadias \u2013 Author of \u201cSOGANUTU\u201d \u2013 A book of life\u2019s Maxims\u201d\n      \u201cLincoln on Grant: \"He makes things get.

It gave us a perspective by which to stabilize our bearings and allowed us to find one of the few ways by which we could understand who we are. The myth that George Washington, not being able to lie, admitted to chopping down his father\u2019s favorite cherry tree helped us create a moral compass. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s moniker \u201cHonest Abe,\u201d took root when he worked as a young store clerk in New Salem, IL. The name stuck before he became a lawyer or a politician. His writings show that he valued honesty and in 1859 when he ran for the presidency the nickname became his campaign slogan. However, apparently \u201dHonest Abe\u201d did lie about whether he was negotiating with the South to end the war and also knowingly concealed some of the most lethal weapons ever devised during the Civil War.\" These however, were very minor infractions when compared to what we are now expected to believe from our politicians.Since World War II the pace of life has moved faster than ever and may actually have overrun our ability to understand the significance and value of our own honesty. We no longer turn to our past for guidance regarding the future; rather we look into our future in terms of what we want and how we will get it. We have developed to the point that we are much smarter than our ancestors and no longer need their morality and guidance. What we don\u2019t know we frequently fabricate and in most cases, no one picks up on it and if they do, it really doesn\u2019t seem to matter. In short the past has become outdated, obsolete and therefore has become largely irrelevant to us. Being less informed about our past is not the result of a lack of information or education, but of ambivalence and indifference. Perhaps history belongs to the ages but not to us. To a great extent we as a people really do not believe that history matters very much, if at all. My quote \u201cHistory is not owned solely by historians. It is part of everyone\u2019s heritage,\u201d was written for the opening page of my award winning book \u201cThe Exciting Story of Cuba.\u201d Not only is it the anchor holding our Ship of State firmly secure, it is the root of our very being. Yes, history is important. In centuries past this statement would have been self-evident. Our predecessors devoted much time and effort in teaching their children history and it helped provide the foundation to understanding who they were. It provided them a reference whereby they could set their own life\u2019s goals. However society has, to a great extent, turned its back on the past. We now live in an era where the present is most important and our future is being built on shifting sand. We, as a people are presently engaged in a struggle for economic survival and choose to think of ourselves in terms of where wind and tide is taking us, rather than where we came from. We can no longer identify with our ancestors, thus they are no longer relevant. Their lives were so different from our own that they no longer can shed any light on our experience or existence. Therefore, in the minds of many of us, the past no longer has the value it once had nor do we give it the credence it deserves. As in war, the truth is the first victim; however this casualty threatens the very fabric of our being. When fact and fiction are interchanged to satisfy the moment, the bedrock of history in undermined. When we depend on the truth to structure our future, it is vital that it be based on truthful history and the honesty of those who write it. It is a crime without penalty when our politicians tell us lies. In fact they are often shamefully rewarded; encouraging them to become even more blatant in the lies they tell.\u201d\n      \u201cMensen zijn even gelukkig als ze besluiten te zijn.\u201d\n      \u201cCh\u00fang ta kh\u00f4ng n\u00ean k\u1ebft \u00e1n ng\u01b0\u1eddi kh\u00e1c \u0111\u1ec3 ch\u00ednh m\u00ecnh kh\u00f4ng b\u1ecb k\u1ebft \u00e1n.\u201d\n      \u201cDon't give up.

Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, 1861\u201d\n      \u201cGUCCI LIFE, ANKARA POCKETI discovered this thing about we youths of nowadays; \u201cwe actually want to live a \u201cGucci\u201d life, but with an \u201cAnkara\u201d pocket\u201d, that is; we want to live large but we are not financially qualified to do so; and that is where immorality comes in. Obviously, our insatiable desire for money and other worldly things will definitely leads to us getting involved in immoral acts such as; cyber crime, armed robbery, kidnapping, terrorism etc. Therefore, we have to look for ways to curb or eradicate this, and that is one of the purposes of this association. We need a lot of \u201cAbraham Lincoln\u201d, \u201cKarl Marx\u201d, \u201cMahatma Gandhi\u201d, \u201cNelson Mandela\u201d, \u201cLee Kwan Yew\u201d, \u201cMartin Luther King\u201d, \u201cGani Fawehinmi\u201d, etc, in our midst to actually make this work. Those who fight for the masses, people who are not self-centred......we have to think of better ways to make things work in this country, but first we have to kill the \u201cGucci life, Ankara pocket\u201d mentality.\u201d\n      \u201cThe thing about quotes on the internet is you cannot confirm their validity.\u201d\n      \u201cA capacity, and taste, for reading gives access to whatever has already been discovered by others.\u201d\n      \u201cBy such examples, by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit, are encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to no restraint, but dread of punishment, they thus become, absolutely unrestrained. -- Having ever regarded Government as their deadliest bane, they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations; and pray for nothing so much, as its total annihilation. While, on the other hand, good men, men who love tranquility, who desire to abide by the laws, and enjoy their benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defense of their country; seeing their property destroyed; their families insulted, and their lives endangered; their persons injured; and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better; become tired of, and disgusted with, a Government that offers them no protection; and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing to lose. Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocractic spirit, which all must admit, is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of any Government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may effectually be broken down and destroyed -- I mean the attachment of the People.\u201d\n      \u201cI know the American People are much attached to their Government; -- I know they would suffer much for its sake; -- I know they would endure evils long and patiently, before they would ever think of exchanging it for another. Yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons and property, are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the alienation of their affections from the Government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come.\u201d", "author": "Abraham Lincoln", "type": "quote", "title": "Abraham Lincoln Quotes"}
