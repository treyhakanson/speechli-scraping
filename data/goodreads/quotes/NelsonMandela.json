The offcamera director asks the poignant question, \u201cWhat do you think your victims must\u2019ve felt like?\u201d and Anwar initially almost fails to see the connection. Eventually, when the bloody obvious correlation hits him, he thinks it unlikely that his victims were as upset as he was, because he was \u201creally\u201d upset. The director, pressing the film\u2019s point home, says, \u201cYeah but it must\u2019ve been worse for them, because we were just pretending; for them it was real.\u201dEvidently at this point the reality of the cruelty he has inflicted hits Anwar, because when they return to the concrete garden where the executions had taken place years before, he, on camera, begins to violently gag.This makes incredible viewing, as this literally visceral ejection of his self and sickness at his previous actions is a vivid catharsis. He gagged at what he\u2019d done.After watching the film, I thought\u2014as did probably everyone who saw it\u2014how can people carry out violent murders by the thousand without it ever occurring to them that it is causing suffering? Surely someone with piano wire round their neck, being asphyxiated, must give off some recognizable signs? Like going \u201couch\u201d or \u201cstop\u201d or having blood come out of their throats while twitching and spluttering into perpetual slumber?What it must be is that in order to carry out that kind of brutal murder, you have to disengage with the empathetic aspect of your nature and cultivate an idea of the victim as different, inferior, and subhuman. The only way to understand how such inhumane behavior could be unthinkingly conducted is to look for comparable examples from our own lives.

He became a South African military leader during World War II. Although some accuse Smuts of having started apartheid, he later stood against it and was a force behind the founding of the United Nations.

Parties were frequently held at my grandparents\u2019 home and the thought of roasted turkeys and potatoes which Cherie had prepared, brings back warm memories of a delightful era, now lost forever.\u201d The Colonial History of South AfricaFor many years South Africa was occupied primarily by Dutch farmers known as Boers who had first arrived in the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 when Jan van Riebeeck established the Dutch East India Company and later by British settlers who arrived in the Cape colony after the Napoleonic wars in the 1820\u2019s, on board the sailing ships the Nautilus and the Chapman. For the most part the two got along like oil and water. After 1806, some of the Dutch-speaking settlers left the Cape Colony and trekked into the interior where they established the Boer Republics. There were many skirmishes between them, as well as with the native tribes. In 1877 after the First Boer War between the Dutch speaking farmers and the English, the Transvaal Boer republic was seized by Britain. Hostilities continued until the Second Boer War erupted in October of 1899, costing the British 22,000 lives. The Dutch speaking farmers, now called Afrikaners, lost 7,000 men and having been overrun by the English acknowledged British sovereignty by signing the peace agreement, known as the \u201cTreaty of Vereeniging,\u201d on May 31, 1902.Although this thumbnail sketch of South African history leaves much unsaid, the colonial lifestyle continued on for the privileged white ruling class until the white, pro-apartheid National Party, was peacefully ousted when the African National Congress won a special national election. Nelson Mandela was elected as the first black president on May 9, 1994. On May 10, 1994, Mandela was inaugurated as The Republic of South Africa's new freely elected President with Thabo Mbeki and F.W.

Nuestro temor m\u00e1s profundo es que somos excesivamente poderosos. Es nuestra luz, y no nuestra oscuridad, la que nos atemoriza. Nos preguntamos: \u00bfqui\u00e9n soy yo para ser brillante, magn\u00edfico, talentoso y fabuloso? En realidad, \u00bfqui\u00e9n eres para no serlo? Infravalor\u00e1ndote no ayudas al mundo. No hay nada de instructivo en encogerse para que otras personas no se sientan inseguras cerca de ti. Esta grandeza de esp\u00edritu no se encuentra solo en algunos de nosotros; est\u00e1 en todos. Y al permitir que brille nuestra propia luz, de forma t\u00e1cita estamos dando a los dem\u00e1s permiso para hacer lo mismo. Al liberarnos de nuestro propio miedo, autom\u00e1ticamente nuestra presencia libera a otros\u201d.\u201d", "      \u201cFor many years South Africa was occupied primarily by Dutch farmers known as Boers who had first arrived in the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 when Jan van Riebeeck established the Dutch East India Company and later by British settlers who arrived in the Cape colony after the Napoleonic wars in the 1820\u2019s, on board the sailing ships the Nautilus and the Chapman. For the most part the two got along like oil and water. After 1806, some of the Dutch-speaking settlers left the Cape Colony and trekked into the interior where they established the Boer Republics. There were many skirmishes between them as well as with the native tribes. In 1877 after the First Boer War between the Dutch speaking farmers and the English the Transvaal Boer republic was seized by Britain. Hostilities continued until the Second Boer War erupted in October of 1899 costing the British 22,000 lives. The Dutch speaking farmers, now called Afrikaners, lost 7,000 men and having been overrun by the English acknowledged British sovereignty signing the peace agreement, known as the \u201cTreaty of Vereeniging,\u201d on May 31, 1902.Although this thumbnail sketch of South African history leaves much unsaid, the colonial lifestyle continued for the privileged white ruling class until the white, pro-apartheid National Party was peacefully ousted and the African National Congress won.
