You make a life by what you give.\u201d\n      \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On\u201d\n      \u201cNever, ever ever ever ever give up.\u201d\n      \u201cAll the great things are simple, and many can be expressed in a single word: freedom, justice, honor, duty, mercy, hope.\u201d\n      \u201cWithout courage all other virtues lose their meaning.\u201d\n      \u201cVictory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without vicory there is no survival.\u201d\n      \u201cAs long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will to win, victory will not be denied us.\u201d\n      \u201cWhere does the family start? It starts with a young man falling in love with a girl - no superior alternative has yet been found.\u201d\n      \u201cHistory with its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past, trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days. What is the worth of all this? The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions. It is very imprudent to walk through life without this shield, because we are so often mocked by the failure of our hopes and the upsetting of our calculations; but with this shield, however the fates may play, we march always in the ranks of honor.\u201d\n      \u201cI never worry about action, but only about inaction.\u201d\n      \u201cThe British nation is unique in this respect: they are the only people who like to be told how bad things are, who like to be told the worst.\u201d\n      \u201cI am easily satisfied with the very best.\u201d\n      \u201cWhen you are going through hell, keep going\u201d\n      \u201cWe are waiting for the long-promised invasion. So are the fishes.\u201d\n      \u201cWhat is the use of living, if it be not to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better place for those who will live in it after we are gone? How else can we put ourselves in harmonious relation with the great verities and consolations of the infinite and the eternal? And I avow my faith that we are marching towards better days. Humanity will not be cast down. We are going on swinging bravely forward along the grand high road and already behind the distant mountains is the promise of the sun.\u201d\n      \u201cThe world today is ruled by harassed politicians absorbed in getting into office or turning out the other man so that not much room is left for debating the great issues on their merits\u201d\n      \u201cYou'll never find a cup of tea big enough or a book long enough to suit me.\u201d\n      \u201cDon't argue about the difficulties. The difficulties will argue for themselves.\u201d\n      \u201cWar is a game that is played with a smile. If you can't smile, grin. If you can't grin, keep out of the way till you can.\u201d\n      \u201cYou create your own universe as you go along.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is a fine thing to be honest, but it is also very important to be right.\u201d\n      \u201cI thought of a remark . . . that the United States is like a 'gigantic boiler. Once the fire is lighted under it there is no limit to the power it can generate.' Being saturated and satiated with emotion and sensation, I went to bed and slept the sleep of the saved and thankful.\u201d\n      \u201cWhen Winston Churchill was asked to cut arts funding in favour of the war effort, he simply asked,'then what are we fighting for?\u201d\n      \u201cNo folly is more costly than the folly of intolerant idealism.\u201d\n      \u201cLady Nancy Astor: Winston, if you were my husband, I'd poison your tea.Churchill: Nancy, if I were your husband, I'd drink it.\u201d\n      \u201cWe have always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English.\u201d\n      \u201cThis is no war of chieftains or of princes, of dynasties or national ambition; it is a war of peoples and of causes. There are vast numbers, not only in this Island but in every land, who will render faithful service in this war, but whose names will never be known, whose deeds will never be recorded. This is a War of the Unknown Warriors\u201d\n      \u201cThis is just the sort of nonsense up with which I will not put.\u201d\n      \u201cIf I had been an Italian I am sure that I should have been whole-heartedly with you from the start to finish in your triumphant struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism.\"(Speech in Rome on 20 January, 1927, praising Mussolini)\u201d\n      \u201cBe a peg, hammered into the frozen ground, immovable.\u201d\n      \u201cThe optimist sees opportunity in every danger; the pessimist sees danger in every opportunity.\u201d\n      \u201cthe price of greatness is responsibility over each of your thoughts.\u201d\n      \u201cAlways remember, a cat looks down on man, a dog looks up to man, but a pig will look man right in the eye and see his equal.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is all true, or it ought to be; and more and better besides.\u201d\n      \u201cWhen eagles are silent, parrots begin to chatter.\u201d\n      \u201cDecided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent. \u201d\n      \u201cIf you go on with this nuclear arms race, all you are going to do is make the rubble bounce.\u201d\n      \u201cHe's a humble man with much to be humble about.\u201d\n      \u201cI first met Winston Churchill in the early summer of 1906 at a dinner party to which I went as a very young girl. Our hostess was Lady Wemyss and I remember that Arthur Balfour, George Wyndman, Hilaire Belloc and Charles Whibley were among the guests\u2026I found myself sitting next to this young man who seemed to me quite different from any other young man I had ever met. For a long time he seemed sunk in abstraction. Then he appeared to become suddenly aware of my existence. He turned on me a lowering gaze and asked me abruptly how old I was. I replied that I was nineteen. \u201cAnd I,\u201d he said despairingly, \u201cam thirty-two already. Younger than anyone else who counts, though, \u201che added, as if to comfort himself. Then savagely: \u201cCurse ruthless time! Curse our mortality. How cruelly short is this allotted span for all we must cram into it!\u201d And he burst forth into an eloquent diatribe on the shortness of human life, the immensity of possible human accomplishment\u2014a theme so well exploited by the poets, prophets, and philosophers of all ages that it might seem difficult to invest it with new and startling significance. Yet for me he did so, in a torrent of magnificent language which appeared to be both effortless and inexhaustible and ended up with the words I shall always remember: \u201cWe are all worms. But I do believe that I am a glow worm.\u201dBy this time I was convinced of it\u2014and my conviction remained unshaken throughout the years that followed. Later he asked me whether I thought that words had a magic and music quite independent of their meaning. I said I certainly thought so, and I quoted as a classic though familiar instance the first lines that came into my head.Charm\u2019d magic casements, opening on the foamOf perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.His eyes blazed with excitement. \u201cSay that again,\u201d he said, \u201csay it again\u2014it is marvelous!\u201d \u201cBut I objected, \u201cYou know these lines. You know the \u2018Ode to a Nightengale.\u2019 \u201d He had apparently never read or heard of it before (I must, however, add that next time I met him he had not learned not merely this but all of the odes to Keats by heart\u2014and he recited them quite mercilessly from start to finish, not sparing me a syllable).Finding that he liked poetry, I quoted to him from one of my own favorite poets, Blake. He listened avidly, repeating some lines to himself with varying emphases and stresses, then added meditatively: \u201cI never knew that old Admiral had found so much time to write such good poetry.\u201d I was astounded that he, with his acute susceptibility to words and power of using them, should have left such tracts of English literature entirely unexplored. But however it happened he had lost nothing by it, when he approached books it was \u201cwith a hungry, empty mind and with fairly srong jaws, and what I got I *bit*.\u201d And his ear for the beauty of language needed no tuning fork.Until the end of dinner I listened to him spellbound. I can remember thinking: This is what people mean when they talk of seeing stars. That is what I am doing now. I do not to this day know who was on my other side. Good manners, social obligation, duty\u2014all had gone with the wind. I was transfixed, transported into a new element. I knew only that I had seen a great light. I recognized it as the light of genius\u2026I cannot attempt to analyze, still less transmit, the light of genius. But I will try to set down, as I remember them, some of the differences which struck me between him and all the others, young and old, whom I have known.First and foremost he was incalculable. He ran true to no form. There lurked in his every thought and world the ambush of the unexpected. I felt also that the impact of life, ideas and even words upon his mind, was not only vivid and immediate, but direct. Between him and them there was no shock absorber of vicarious thought or precedent gleaned either from books or other minds. His relationship wit\u201d\n      \u201cDuring their lifetimes, every man and woman will stumble across a great opportunity. Sadly, most of them will simply pick themselves up, dust themselves down and carry on as if nothing ever happened.\u201d\n      \u201cI am a man of simple tastes easily satisfied with the best\u201d\n      \u201cMen occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing had happened.\u201d\n      \u201cA man is about as big as the things that make him angry\u201d\n      \u201cStill, if you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may even be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.\u201d\n      \u201cA preposition is a terrible thing to end a sentence with.\u201d\n      \u201cSafari, so goody.\u201d\n      \u201cIf you\u2019re going through hell, keep going.\u201d\n      \u201cI should have liked to be asked to say what I knew. They always tried to ask what I did not know. When I would have willingly displayed my knowledge, they sought to expose my ignorance. This sort of treatment had only one result: I did not do well in examinations\u201d\n      \u201cI decline utterly to be impartial between the fire brigade and the fire.\u201d\n      \u201cMeeting Franklin Roosevelt was like opening your first bottle of champagne; knowing him was like drinking it.\u201d\n      \u201cOf this I am certain, that if we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the future.\u201d\n      \u201cChurchill was in the lavatory in the House of Commons and his secretary knocked on the door and said: Excuse me Prime Minister, but the Lord Privy Seal wishes to speak to you. After a pause Churchill replied: Tell His Lordship: I'm sealed on The Privy and can only deal with one shit at a time\u201d\n      \u201cAnd do not suppose that this is the end. This is only the beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigour, we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.\u201d\n      \u201cDon't talk to me about naval tradition. It's nothing but rum, sodomy, and the lash.\u201d\n      \u201cSolitary Trees if they grow at all, grow strong.\u201d\n      \u201cLet our advance worrying become advance thinking and planning.\u201d\n      \u201cI love to learn but I do not want to be taught\u201d\n      \u201cI have taken more from alcohol than alcohol has ever taken from me.\u201d\n      \u201cI've gotten more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me.\u201d\n      \u201cI am ready to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the ordeal of meeting me is another matter.\u201d\n      \u201cThus ended the great American Civil War, which must upon the whole be considered the noblest and least avoidable of all the great mass conflicts of which till then there was record.\u201d\n      \u201cHe spoke with more eloquence than wisdom.\u201d\n      \u201cIf I was your wife, I would poison your coffee.\"\"Madam, if I was your husband, I would drink it!\u201d\n      \u201cThere is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them\u201d\n      \u201cNothing is more costly, nothing is more sterile, than vengeance.\u201d\n      \u201cWe build dwellings and thereafter they build us.\u201d\n      \u201cIf you are going to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite.\u201d\n      \u201cI hate nobody except Hitler--and that is professional.\u201d\n      \u201cSuccess is going from failure to failure with great enthusiasm.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\u201d\n      \u201cA man must choose his own way of life, and\u2026it is only by following out one\u2019s own bent that there can be the really harmonious life.\u201d [In an interview conducted by Bram Stoker]\u201d\n      \u201cbut at the Lychgate we may all pass our own conduct and our own judgments under a searching review. It is not given to human beings, happily for them, for otherwise life would be intolerable, to foresee or to predict to any large extent the unfolding course of events. In one phase men seem to have been right, in another they seem to have been wrong. Then again, a few years later, when the perspective of time has lengthened, all stands in a different setting. There is a new proportion. There is another scale of values. History with its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past, trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days. What is the worth of all this? The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions. It is very imprudent to walk through life without this shield, because we are so often mocked by the failure of our hopes and the upsetting of our calculations; but with this shield, however the fates may play, we march always in the ranks of honor.\u201d\n      \u201cThose whose work and pleasure are one... are... Fortune's favoured children.\u201d\n      \u201cI am an optimist. It does not seem too much use being anything else.\u201d\n      \u201cNo lover ever studied every whim of his mistress as I did those of President Roosevelt.\u201d\n      \u201cWhat General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.\u201d\n      \u201cIt's Never Over 'till it's over!Never Give Up! Never.\u201d\n      \u201cI always avoid prophesying beforehand because it is much better to prophesy after the event has already taken place.\u201d\n      \u201cA change is as good as a rest.\u201d\n      \u201cDinner would have been splendid...if the wine had been as cold as the soup, the beef as rare as the service, the brandy as old as the fish, and the maid as willing as the Duchess.\u201d\n      \u201cThere is no such thing as public opinion. There is only published opinion.\u201d\n      \u201cThe reserve of modern assertions is sometimes pushed to extremes in which the fear of being contradicted leads the writer to strip himself of almost all sense and meaning.\u201d\n      \u201cWe make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries. We contend that for a nation to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle. The whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that, when nations are strong, they are not always just, and when they wish to be just, they are no longer strong.\u201d\n      \u201cThe most frightful of all spectacles is the strength of the civilization without its mercy.\u201d\n      \u201cYou have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.\u201d\n      \u201cIn the long years to come, not only will the people of this island but of the world, wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human hearts, look back to what we've done, and they will say 'do not despair, do not yield...march straightforward.\u201d\n      \u201cThose who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace and those who could make a good peace would never have won the war.\u201d\n      \u201cThe War was decided in the first twenty days of fighting, and all that happened afterwards consisted in battles which, however formidable and devastating, were but desperate and vain appeals against the decision of Fate.\u201d\n      \u201cPerhaps we have been guilty of some terminological inexactitudes.\u201d\n      \u201cNever, give in! Never give in! Never, never, never... In nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions or honor and good sense!\u201d\n      \u201cThere are few words which are used more loosely than the word \u201cCivilization.\u201d What does it mean? It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians. It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs, the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny, give place to parliaments where laws are made, and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained. That is Civilization\u2014and in its soil grow continually freedom, comfort, and culture. When Civilization reigns, in any country, a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people. The traditions of the past are cherished, and the inheritance bequeathed to us by former wise or valiant men becomes a rich estate to be enjoyed and used by all.\u201d\n      \u201cOf course I'm an egoist. Where do you get if you aren't?\u201d\n      \u201cNow that we have run out of money we have to think.\u201d\n      \u201cWinston Churchill said 'In war time, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies'. Any book called The Truth should therefore have one. \u201d\n      \u201cA baboon in a forest is a matter of legitimate speculation; a baboon in a zoo is an object of public curiosity; but a baboon in your wife\u2019s bed is a cause of the gravest concern.\u201d\n      \u201cNot an hour is lost that is spent in the saddle.\u201d\n      \u201cSex...I enjoy it immensely\u201d\n      \u201cThere are men in the world who derive as stern an exaltation from the proximity of disaster and ruin, as others from success.\u201d\n      \u201cHistory with its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past, trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days.\u201d\n      \u201cWhen I hear a man say that his childhood was the happiest time of his life, I think (puff) my friend, you have had a pretty poor life.\u201d\n      \u201cWhat is the use of living, if it be not to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better place for those who will live in it after we are gone?\u201d\n      \u201cThr truth is inconvertible.Malice may attack itand ignorance may deride it,but in the end,there it is.....\u201d\n      \u201cChurchill kept perspective on the crowds that gathered to hear him speak by conceding they would be twice as big if gathered to see him hanged.\u201d\n      \u201cResposibility is the price of greatness.\u201d\n      \u201cI don't like mixing up moralities with mathematics.\u201d\n      \u201cAs one's fortunes are reduced, one spirit must expand to fill the void.\u201d\n      \u201cWe are the masters of our fate.\u201d\n      \u201cA vocabulary of truth and simplicity will be of service throughout your life.\u201d\n      \u201cPeople stumble over the truth from time to time,but most pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing happened.\u201d\n      \u201cWe hope to see a Europe where men of every country will think of being a European as of belonging to their native land, and...wherever they go in this wide domain...will truly feel, \u2018Here I am at home.\u201d\n      \u201c(Exchange with Winston Churchill)Churchill explains that having a woman in Parliament was like having one intrude on him in the bathroom, to which the Lady Astor retorted, \"Sir, you are not handsome enough to have such fears\".\u201d\n      \u201cStill, it is the primary right of men to die and kill for the land they live in, and to punish with exceptional severity all members of their own race who have warmed their hands at the invaders' hearth.\u201d\n      \u201c2.\tWe must never cease to proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and the English common law find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence.\u201d\n      \u201cHe has the gift of compressing the largest amount of words into the smallest amount of thoughts.\u201d\n      \u201cAll I want is compliance with my wishes, after reasonable discussion.\u201d\n      \u201cIndividual Moslems may show splendid qualities \u2013 but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world.\u201d\n      \u201cThe Pessimist Sees Difficulty In Every Opportunity. The Optimist Sees Opportunity In Every Difficulty.\u201d\n      \u201cMr. Attlee is a very modest man. Indeed he has a lot to be modest about.\u201d\n      \u201cWe shall fight on the beaches,we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,we shall fight in the hills;but we shall never surrender.\u201d\n      \u201cI like to live in the past. I don't think people are going to get much fun in the future.\u201d\n      \u201cIt has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.\u201d\n      \u201cSocialism is the philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and thegospel of envy.\u201d[PERTH, 28 MAY 1948]\u201d\n      \u201cSuccess is going from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm.\u201d\n      \u201cno hour of life is wasted that is spent in the saddle\u201d\n      \u201cThe machinery of propaganda may pack their minds with falsehood and deny them truth for many generations of time.

Really great presidents lie. Abraham Lincoln managed to end slavery in America partially by deception. (In an 1858 debate, he flatly insisted that he had no intention of abolishing slavery in states where it was already legal\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had to say this in order to slow the tide of secession.) Franklin Roosevelt lied about the U.S. position of neutrality until we entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor. (Though the public and Congress believed his public pledge of impartiality, he was already working in secret with Winston Churchill and selling arms to France.) Ronald Reagan lied about Iran-Contra so much that it now seems like he was honestly confused. Politically, the practice of lying is essential. By the time the Lewinsky story broke, Clinton had already lied about many, many things. (He\u2019d openly lied about his level of commitment to gay rights during the \u201992 campaign.) The presidency is not a job for an honest man. It\u2019s way too complex. If honesty drove the electoral process, Jimmy Carter would have served two terms and the 2008 presidential race would have been a dead heat between Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich.\u201d\n      \u201cAny man under 30 who is not a liberal has no heart, and any man over thirty who is not a conservative has no brains.\u201d\n      \u201cBy swallowing evil word unsaid noone has ever yet harmed his stomach.\u201d\n      \u201cWriting a book is an adventure to begin with, it is a toy and an amusement, then it becomes a mistress, and then it becomes a master, and then a tyrant.

But now, when mighty populations are impelled on each other, each individual severally embittered and inflamed\u2014when the resources of science and civilisation sweep away everything that might mitigate their fury, an European war can only end in the ruin of the vanquished and the scarcely less fatal commercial dislocation and exhaustion of the conquerors.

Several of those in the Downing Street position were already dead... and at last the Bren ceased its chatter, its last magazine emptied.Churchill reluctantly abandoned the machine-gun, drew his pistol and with great satisfaction, for it was a notoriously inaccurate weapon, shot dead the first German to reach the foot of the steps. As two more rushed forward, covered by a third in the distance, Winston Churchill moved out of the shelter of the sandbags, as if personally to bar the way up Downing Street. A German NCO, running up to find the cause of the unexpected hold-up, recognised him and shouted to the soldiers not to shoot, but he was too late. A burst of bullets from a machine-carbine caught the Prime Minister in the chest. He died instantly, his back to Downing Street, his face toward the enemy, his pistol still in his hand.\u201d\n      \u201cIf the present tries to sit in judgment on the past, it will lose the future.\u201d\n      \u201cI like a man who grins when he fights.\u201d\n      \u201cAround Whitehall, a sacking from Churchill was known as the 'awarding of the Order of the Boot.\u201d\n      \u201cWe have nothing to fear but fear itself.\u201d\n      \u201cYou cannot tell from appearances how things will go.

When, during a 1944 meeting in Moscow, Molotov suggested that the 85-year-old novelist should be spared the firing squad after the war, the Norwegian justice minister in exile responded, \u201cYou are too soft, Mr. Molotov.\u201d\n      \u201cSir Winston Churchill was born into the respected family of the Dukes of Marlborough. His mother Jeanette, was an attractive American-born British socialite and a member of the well known Spencer family. Winston had a military background, having graduated from Sandhurst, the British Royal Military Academy. Upon graduating he served in the Army between 1805 and 1900 and again between 1915 and 1916. As a British military officer, he saw action in India, the Anglo\u2013Sudan War, and the Second South African Boer War. Leaving the army as a major in 1899, he became a war correspondent covering the Boer War in the Natal Colony, during which time he wrote books about his experiences. Churchill was captured and treated as a prisoner of war. Churchill had only been a prisoner for four weeks before he escaped, prying open some of the flooring he crawled out under the building and ran through some of the neighborhoods back alleys and streets. On the evening of December 12, 1899, he jumped over a wall to a neighboring property, made his way to railroad tracks and caught a freight train heading north to Lourenco Marques, the capital of Portuguese Mozambique, which is located on the Indian Ocean and freedom. For the following years, he held many political and cabinet positions including the First Lord of the Admiralty. During the First World War Churchill resumed his active army service, for a short period of time, as the commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. After the war he returned to his political career as a Conservative Member of Parliament, serving as the Chancellor of the Exchequer where in 1925, he returned the pound sterling to the gold standard. This move was considered a factor to the deflationary pressure on the British Pound Sterling, during the depression. During the 1930\u2019s Churchill was one of the first to warn about the increasing, ruthless strength of Nazi Germany and campaigned for a speedy military rearmament. At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty for a second time, and in May of 1940, Churchill became the Prime Minister after Neville Chamberlain\u2019s resignation. An inspirational leader during the difficult days of 1940\u20131941, he led Britain until victory had been secured. In 1955 Churchill suffered a serious of strokes. Stepping down as Prime Minister he however remained a Member of Parliament until 1964. In 1965, upon his death at ninety years of age, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a state funeral, which was one of the largest gatherings of representatives and statesmen in history.\u201d\n      \u201cBooks, in all their variety, offer the human intellect the means whereby civilization may be carried triumphantly forward.\u201d\n      \u201cWhether you believe or disbelieve, it is a wicked thing to take away Man's hope.\u201d\n      \u201cTruth is the most valuable thing in the world but often times is hidden by a bodyguard of lies.\u201d\n      \u201cGood riddance to that wuthering height.\u201d\n      \u201cIf your going through hell, keep going.\u201d\n      \u201cWe seek no treasure, we seek no territorial gains, we seek only the right of man to be free; we seek his rights to worship his god, to lead his life in his own way, secure from persecution.

Winston Churchill. Noi ii zicem Church. - Si se leagana cand merge? - Poftim? Louis habar nu avea ce voia sa spuna batranul. - Inca mai are coite, sau l-ai castrat? - Nu, raspunse Louis. Nu, nu l-am castrat. De fapt, fusesera cateva discutii in contradictoriu pe aceasta tema, inca de pe vremea in care locuiau la Chicago. Rachel a vrut sa-l castreze pe Church, fixase chiar data operatiei cu doctorul veterinar. Louis a anulat-o. Nici pana in ziua de azi nu a reusit sa inteleaga de ce a facut-o. Nu era nici pe departe vorba de ceva atat de simplu sau atat de stupid cum ar fi echivalarea masculinitatii sale cu cea a motanului fiicei lui, si nu era vorba nici de indignarea sa la gandul ca gospodina grasa de alaturi va face tambalau din cauza mirosului de urina de motan sau din cauza pungilor cu gunoi pe care i le sfasia. E drept ca si aceste idei ii trecusera prin minte, insa mai mult fusese vorba de senzatia puternica, dar intrucatva cetoasa, ca operatia respectiva ar fi distrus ceva anume din personalitatea lui Church - ceva ce el pretuia extrem de mult - ar fi stins privirea aceea din ochii verzi ai motanului care iti spunea sa te duci dracului.\u201d\n      \u201cYou create your universe as you go along.\u201d\n      \u201cIf Hitler invaded hell, I would make at least a favourable reference to the devil in the House of Commons\u201d\n      \u201cIf you cannot read all your books, at any rate handle, or as it were, fondle them...let them be your friends.\u201d\n      \u201cThe price of greatness is responsibilty.\u201d\n      \u201cL\u2019influence de cette religion paralyse le d\u00e9veloppement social de ses fid\u00e8les Il n\u2019existe pas de plus puissante force r\u00e9trograde dans le monde.Si la Chr\u00e9tient\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par les bras puissants de la Science, la civilisation de l\u2019Europe moderne pourrait tomber, comme tomba celle de la Rome antique.\u201d\n      \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\u201d\n      \u201cIt is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\u201d\n      \u201cRussian may seem narrow-minded, impudent, or even stupid people, but can only pray for those who are against them.\u201d\n      \u201cA sheep in sheep\u2019s clothing.

Why, then, turn to the democratic vote to be well governed? As Winston Churchill once quipped, five minutes with average voters should shatter any faith in democracy.\u201d\n      \u201cI suppose the Party machinery will carry everything before it, and, as heretofore, the Extremists on both sides, whether progressive or reactionary, will set the tune and collar the organization, and all we wretched, unorganized middle thinkers will either be destroyed between the contending forces, or compelled to serve in support of one disproportionate cause or the other.\u201d\n      \u201cIf you are going through hell, keep going.\u201d\n      \u201cThe failure to strangle Bolshevism at its birth and to bring Russia, then prostrate, by one means or another, into the general democratic system lies heavy upon us today.\u201d\n      \u201cThe fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.\u201d\n      \u201cWinston Churchill's future sister-in-law had to plead with him not to convert to Islam.\u201d\n      \u201cThe future though imminent is obscure.\u201d\n      \u201cNo Socialist system can be established without a political police. Many of those who are advocating Socialism or voting Socialist today will be horrified at this idea. That is because they are short-sighted, that is because they do not see where their theories are leading them. No Socialist Government conducting the entire life and industry of the country could afford to allow free, sharp, or violently-worded expressions of public discontent. They would have to fall back on some form of Gestapo, no doubt very humanely directed in the first instance. And this would nip opinion in the bud; it would stop criticism as it reared its head, and it would gather all the power to the supreme party and the party leaders, rising like stately pinnacles above their vast bureaucracies of Civil servants, no longer servants and no longer civil.\u201d\n      \u201cSocialism is inseparably interwoven with Totalitarianism and the abject worship of the State. It is not alone that property, in all its forms, is struck at, but that liberty, in all its forms, is challenged by the fundamental conceptions of Socialism.\u201d\n      \u201cA pessimist sees the di\ufb03 culty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every di\ufb03 culty.\u201d \u2014Winston Churchill\u201d\n      \u201cIf I were married to you, I\u2019d put poison in your coffee,\u201d Lady Astor once famously remarked to Winston Churchill. \u201cIf I were married to you,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019d drink it.\u201d\n      \u201cWe shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.\u201d\n      \u201cI dont give a shit about a god damn thing.\u201d\n      \u201cWinston Churchill once said \"Never Give Up\", little pause..... \"Never Give Up\" and again pause.... \"Never Give Up\".
